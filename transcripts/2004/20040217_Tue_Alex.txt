[00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:06.198]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.858 --> 00:00:07.919]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:09.799]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:11.200]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.920]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.322]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.702 --> 00:00:21.823]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:28.966]  Oh, my French.
[00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:33.521]  It's Tuesday, the 17th day of February 2004.
[00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:37.623]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:39.864 --> 00:00:41.164]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.184 --> 00:00:46.787]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:00:46.927 --> 00:00:50.289]  We're going to have wide-open phones in the first two hours.
[00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:58.253]  In the third hour, we've got Greg Pallas coming back on the show, award-winning BBC investigative reporter, best-selling author.
[00:00:59.798 --> 00:01:14.061]  To get more into our government helping arm and cover up the proliferation of nuclear weapons components by Pakistan, but also the smoking gun evidence of Bush lying about his military record.
[00:01:14.301 --> 00:01:17.022]  So that's coming up in the third hour, in the first two hours.
[00:01:17.442 --> 00:01:19.083]  We're going to have wide-open phones.
[00:01:19.223 --> 00:01:23.043]  Any issue you want to discuss, any news item, anything you want to go over.
[00:01:23.984 --> 00:01:26.144]  Coming up, two more GIs and a U.S.
[00:01:26.164 --> 00:01:27.585]  civilian killed in Iraq.
[00:01:28.285 --> 00:01:29.365]  This is every day now.
[00:01:31.597 --> 00:01:33.158]  This is out of the Star Bulletin.
[00:01:33.378 --> 00:01:36.240]  Genealogists call Bush and Kerry kin.
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.302]  Now, I'm confused.
[00:01:38.422 --> 00:01:40.103]  Reuters says they're third cousins.
[00:01:40.924 --> 00:01:42.825]  NPR says they're distant cousins.
[00:01:44.146 --> 00:01:46.447]  And this article says they're 16th cousins.
[00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:47.608]  So I don't know.
[00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:56.334]  I'm not a genealogist specialist, but from what I've read, most of the Skull and Bones members are related on multiple sides of their families.
[00:01:56.774 --> 00:01:57.715]  So we'll go over that.
[00:01:58.673 --> 00:02:00.653]  Also, Kerry would be third richest U.S.
[00:02:00.693 --> 00:02:01.554]  president in history.
[00:02:02.134 --> 00:02:02.854]  That's not true.
[00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:05.874]  The real money like Bush and others hide their true wealth.
[00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:10.115]  I'm not saying having wealth is bad, but the way they got it is bad.
[00:02:11.836 --> 00:02:15.876]  Bush, for the third time, has now released his full military record.
[00:02:16.716 --> 00:02:19.777]  But they wouldn't let the media leave with copies of it.
[00:02:19.817 --> 00:02:20.957]  We'll go over that.
[00:02:21.197 --> 00:02:22.838]  We already have the military record.
[00:02:23.218 --> 00:02:24.458]  He was AWOL, folks.
[00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:30.082]  Also, surplus Army vehicles find new life in error of Homeland Security.
[00:02:30.102 --> 00:02:33.744]  They say since 9-11 they're arming and militarizing your local police.
[00:02:34.325 --> 00:02:37.087]  They were doing this at least a decade before 9-11.
[00:02:38.508 --> 00:02:46.133]  But again, now that the police state's in place, they go, oh, it's because of 9-11, but it has nothing to do with keeping you safe and everything to do with oppressing you.
[00:02:46.493 --> 00:02:49.075]  What is it they're planning that they know we're going to resist?
[00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.350]  Also, new scholarship created for whites only from CNN.
[00:02:54.971 --> 00:03:00.252]  A student group at Roger Williams University is offering a new scholarship for which only white students are eligible.
[00:03:00.652 --> 00:03:04.014]  A move, they say, is designed to protest affirmative action.
[00:03:04.974 --> 00:03:06.535]  And I agree with what they're saying.
[00:03:07.275 --> 00:03:10.336]  Also, Schwarzenegger urged to arrest San Francisco mayor.
[00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:15.538]  The group says Newsom should face prison for false marriage licenses.
[00:03:15.618 --> 00:03:16.398]  We'll get to that.
[00:03:17.877 --> 00:03:22.138]  From the Daily Texan right here in Austin, Army agent questions law students.
[00:03:22.718 --> 00:03:28.339]  You have military intelligence officers walking around, cornering people here in Austin.
[00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:31.120]  All part of living in the new third world system.
[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.601]  Also out of AFP, give police Star Trek-style weapons, says senior officer.
[00:03:36.661 --> 00:03:39.202]  They've got these little, well, wait till we get to it.
[00:03:39.222 --> 00:03:42.202]  It is science fiction, but here we are in 2004.
[00:03:43.182 --> 00:03:45.463]  Also doctors who carry guns and make arrests.
[00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:48.576]  A couple sue over police raid.
[00:03:49.116 --> 00:03:52.419]  Book, Bush was arrested for cocaine in 1972.
[00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:57.502]  We'll get into all of it and a lot more here on the show today.
[00:03:57.642 --> 00:03:59.804]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:59.824 --> 00:04:00.184]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:00.204 --> 00:04:04.227]  But the first thing I'm going to cover when we get back is primetime with Diane Sawyer last night.
[00:04:15.874 --> 00:04:17.155]  When we get back, I'll go over it.
[00:04:17.255 --> 00:04:18.395]  I got very angry.
[00:04:18.415 --> 00:04:21.136]  It's something I've been doing more and more these days.
[00:04:21.476 --> 00:04:34.602]  When I got home at about midnight from working on a new film, my wife had recorded it for me, and so I sat down and watched the interview with Mel Gibson, and I've got some comments on this when I get back.
[00:04:35.182 --> 00:04:42.325]  I've got some very serious comments about Mr. Foxman and others who are a pack of liars, and I am sick of them.
[00:04:43.085 --> 00:04:45.086]  So that's coming up as well, and...
[00:04:47.006 --> 00:04:51.952]  We've got to expose these organizations that are trying to destroy the First Amendment here in the United States.
[00:04:52.593 --> 00:04:53.213]  So stay with us.
[00:04:53.314 --> 00:04:56.297]  I'll discuss that when we get back, and then we'll go to your calls and all this news.
[00:04:57.278 --> 00:04:59.040]  Infowars.com is the website.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.501]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:04.992]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[00:05:05.312 --> 00:05:05.653]  Yes.
[00:05:05.933 --> 00:05:10.735]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood, the richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[00:05:10.855 --> 00:05:19.798]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, two ounces of juice have the same nutrition as three pounds of choice garden produce.
[00:05:19.938 --> 00:05:27.641]  The get-up-and-go energy, healing, blood-building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.
[00:05:27.861 --> 00:05:30.042]  Hi, I'm Alan Davison at Monocot Wheatgrass.
[00:05:30.162 --> 00:05:30.542]  We're good to go.
[00:05:30.562 --> 00:05:30.722]  I think?
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.364]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:06:06.724 --> 00:06:10.808]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:06:11.108 --> 00:06:11.649]  We listened.
[00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:16.933]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:06:17.213 --> 00:06:17.694]  We listened.
[00:06:18.094 --> 00:06:21.137]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:06:21.557 --> 00:06:22.098]  We listened.
[00:06:22.558 --> 00:06:25.981]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[00:06:25.981 --> 00:06:26.301]  We're good.
[00:06:52.906 --> 00:06:55.011]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.231 --> 00:07:07.074]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:07:07.374 --> 00:07:08.754]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:07:08.954 --> 00:07:11.135]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:07:11.295 --> 00:07:13.396]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:07:13.676 --> 00:07:18.618]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:22.960]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.400]  That's 888-2533-139.
[00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:54.012]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[00:07:54.272 --> 00:07:55.032]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:07:55.052 --> 00:07:56.233]  Big Brother.
[00:07:56.293 --> 00:07:57.514]  Mainstream media.
[00:07:57.534 --> 00:08:01.515]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:01.676 --> 00:08:03.356]  You want answers?
[00:08:03.697 --> 00:08:04.637]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.428 --> 00:08:17.389]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:21.731]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.952 --> 00:08:33.215]  We're now 8 minutes and 25 seconds into this first hour of global transmission against tyranny in defense of liberty.
[00:08:34.495 --> 00:08:36.296]  We're going to have wide open phones.
[00:08:36.316 --> 00:08:41.298]  We've got Greg Pallas coming back on with some of the new revelations inside the New World Order in the third hour.
[00:08:42.495 --> 00:08:47.656]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:50.777 --> 00:09:10.903]  Last night, I went and worked on a film that I'm putting together, and at about midnight, I got home, and my wife had taped primetime with Diane Sawyer for me because Mel Gibson was on the show, and I wanted to see what they tried to say about the passion and what his response was.
[00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:20.194]  And my wife had just let the tape run, so I had two hours of shows on there.
[00:09:20.214 --> 00:09:29.418]  And so I just hit rewind and sat down and started waiting for it to conclude its rewinding.
[00:09:30.418 --> 00:09:41.123]  And I got impatient and hit play, and it stopped on Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League, which is really the Defamation League of Freedom.
[00:09:42.848 --> 00:09:54.937]  And it stopped on Mr. Foxman and saying how scary the film was and how scary it was that these Christians were crying and everybody was so silent after he snuck into a screening of it.
[00:09:54.997 --> 00:10:00.721]  And Mrs. CFR Diane Sawyer said to him, she said, well, is Mel Gibson anti-Semitic?
[00:10:00.841 --> 00:10:01.982]  Is his film anti-Semitic?
[00:10:02.662 --> 00:10:05.484]  And he said, no, it's not, but it's still dangerous.
[00:10:07.746 --> 00:10:09.607]  And I said to myself, what a liar!
[00:10:11.047 --> 00:10:13.948]  Because this guy has gotten all over television.
[00:10:14.068 --> 00:10:23.850]  I've read his press releases on this show four or five months ago where he said, there is no doubt, Mel Gibson is an anti-Semite.
[00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:24.990]  Mel Gibson is bad.
[00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:26.831]  This film needs to be boycotted.
[00:10:30.212 --> 00:10:32.432]  And I thought, man, I hope Mel Gibson responds to that.
[00:10:32.492 --> 00:10:34.893]  So I rewound it to the start of the program.
[00:10:37.376 --> 00:10:39.838]  And sure enough, Mel Gibson brought up the point.
[00:10:39.859 --> 00:10:41.020]  He said, you know, it's funny.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:49.968]  These people are saying I'm not an anti-Semite now, and this film isn't anti-Semitic, which I'm not, he went on to say, but they sure have been saying it a lot leading up to this.
[00:10:54.411 --> 00:10:55.432]  But think about this.
[00:10:55.973 --> 00:11:01.398]  You make a movie about Jesus Christ, and from the clips I've seen of it, I mean, it's very...
[00:11:02.422 --> 00:11:04.904]  Cinematic, incredible cinematography.
[00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:06.005]  I can't wait to see it.
[00:11:06.025 --> 00:11:07.006]  I've already bought tickets.
[00:11:08.887 --> 00:11:13.231]  And you would have thought Diane Sawyer was talking about pornography or something.
[00:11:13.251 --> 00:11:17.053]  You know, ooh, this is so, you know, this movie's so dangerous.
[00:11:17.154 --> 00:11:18.014]  Oh my goodness.
[00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:23.899]  And all these people discussing it and admonishing us that we shouldn't be anti-Semitic.
[00:11:23.999 --> 00:11:28.682]  And, you know, when we watch this, and well, are the Gospels accurate?
[00:11:28.742 --> 00:11:31.685]  And, well, some historians say they're not.
[00:11:31.765 --> 00:11:31.845]  And
[00:11:34.597 --> 00:11:46.409]  And this is in a country where we've got naked people dancing around in gothic simulated orgies during the halftime at the Super Bowl.
[00:11:46.429 --> 00:11:54.877]  This is a country where children's programming is promoting homosexuality, sex, period.
[00:11:54.897 --> 00:11:58.461]  I mean, I don't have to go over how corrupt the media has gotten.
[00:11:59.423 --> 00:12:00.665]  But they're not concerned about that.
[00:12:00.705 --> 00:12:11.601]  They're concerned about a movie about Jesus Christ, word for word, out of the Gospels, even put together in the same language used at the time, Latin and Aramaic.
[00:12:14.702 --> 00:12:30.416]  And so I sat there and watched the primetime with Diane Sawyer on ABC News, and she sat there with a dirty look on her face, and Mel Gibson would make little jokes, and she would just sit there giving him a dirty look and obviously putting him off ease.
[00:12:33.439 --> 00:12:40.205]  And I talked to Hutton a few days ago before this aired, Mel Gibson's father, who's, again, just an expert on the New World Order.
[00:12:40.225 --> 00:12:41.786]  We really respect his opinion on this show.
[00:12:42.327 --> 00:12:49.510]  He said, well, I don't want you to talk about this on air until after it airs, but after it does, you know, you're welcome to.
[00:12:51.431 --> 00:13:00.775]  They interviewed Mel for three and a half hours and then ended up, I guess, about 12, 15 minutes, I didn't time it out, where Mel's actually talking on the screen.
[00:13:00.795 --> 00:13:02.996]  And he did a great job.
[00:13:03.056 --> 00:13:11.200]  I mean, most people, if they talk for three and a half hours, the news media is going to find something damning to use against them, but they were unable to do that in this interview.
[00:13:13.513 --> 00:13:26.699]  But Hutton told me that Mel told him that he said, you know, when this comes out, I think I'm just going to go hide somewhere because of all the heat that's been on me, and I think I'm going to hide somewhere where nobody can find me.
[00:13:26.719 --> 00:13:31.461]  I think I'm going to pitch a tent next to the weapons of mass destruction, wherever they are.
[00:13:34.202 --> 00:13:42.046]  And I predicted on the show yesterday, without stealing Mel Gibson's lines, that that would never be in the piece.
[00:13:48.453 --> 00:13:54.155]  But imagine being interviewed for three and a half hours and then having it condensed down to just 15 minutes or so.
[00:13:54.175 --> 00:13:55.716]  I'd say less than 15 minutes.
[00:13:57.076 --> 00:14:06.560]  But to see Mr. Foxman of the ADL get up there on television and say, No, Mel Gibson isn't anti-Semitic.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.480]  We've never said that.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.561]  And this film isn't anti-Semitic.
[00:14:10.439 --> 00:14:19.303]  But then, just a few months ago, he put out press releases, you can read them at the ADL website, saying Mel Gibson is an anti-Semite, Mel Gibson's bad, this movie's bad, it should be boycotted.
[00:14:21.804 --> 00:14:23.625]  There's no credibility with the ADL.
[00:14:24.866 --> 00:14:26.407]  And I'm sick and tired of the ADL.
[00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:33.330]  I mean, if somebody's got real Nazi ties and really is a racist, they leave them alone.
[00:14:34.818 --> 00:14:45.524]  But pro-gun groups, land rights organizations, Christian organizations, anybody really out there doing anything wholesome is demonized by these people, and I'm sick of it.
[00:14:47.825 --> 00:14:53.608]  And I don't think that the ADL and the Simon Wiesenthal Center should be representing Jews.
[00:14:54.689 --> 00:14:56.310]  I don't think Jews should put up with them.
[00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:58.631]  I don't think that Jews should let them be their spokesmen.
[00:14:59.491 --> 00:15:04.274]  They've lost a bunch of lawsuits for slandering and libeling people, and they're sure to lose more
[00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:06.892]  I mean, I've had the ADL attack me.
[00:15:07.753 --> 00:15:11.195]  And listeners, you know that I don't really criticize Israel much.
[00:15:11.295 --> 00:15:13.857]  I don't ever go after Jews on this show.
[00:15:13.917 --> 00:15:16.018]  I go after some of the corruption in Israel.
[00:15:16.298 --> 00:15:19.800]  But I'm not going after Jews individually as if they're bad themselves.
[00:15:20.841 --> 00:15:29.907]  But the media moguls and the people that run the ADL and the Simon Wiesenthal Center, I mean, I've seen them.
[00:15:31.107 --> 00:15:32.888]  They had a listing called Digital Hate 2000.
[00:15:34.176 --> 00:15:50.646]  And it listed mainstream gun organizations, it listed musicians who we've played on this show, nothing about race, and they count on the public just being ignorant and not researching it and not finding out what a fraud it is.
[00:15:53.047 --> 00:15:59.971]  Now, why is the ADL backing off now, and why is the Simon Wiesenthal Center backing off demonizing the passion?
[00:16:01.374 --> 00:16:03.215]  Because their lives didn't work.
[00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:04.315]  It blew up in their face.
[00:16:05.016 --> 00:16:19.942]  Mel Gibson traveled this country from end to end, screening the film to hundreds of large crowds, and when people went and saw it, Paul Harvey and others went to see it.
[00:16:20.222 --> 00:16:21.283]  They said, I don't get it.
[00:16:21.303 --> 00:16:23.104]  I don't understand how this is anti-semitic.
[00:16:23.604 --> 00:16:30.907]  In fact, the ADL has now injected that into the debate, where if somebody watches it, that's all they're going to be thinking about now.
[00:16:32.091 --> 00:16:38.573]  In fact, the ADL is actually creating an overall dislike of Jews.
[00:16:39.273 --> 00:16:44.135]  So if anybody is hurting Jews, I'd have to say it's the ADL.
[00:16:44.875 --> 00:17:01.461]  I mean, people would have gone and they made a good point in the piece, one of the pastors they were interviewing, that when Christians see a cross in major surveys, they feel love and compassion and Christ's sacrifice, and that when they, quote, interview Jews and they see a cross, they feel threatened and that it's, you know,
[00:17:02.463 --> 00:17:03.564]  This bad symbol.
[00:17:06.226 --> 00:17:07.147]  And that's ridiculous.
[00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:21.097]  Also, Mrs. Council on Foreign Relations member, Diane Sawyer, Mrs. Anti-Gun, who's been putting out all these stilted and manipulated news pieces, she said, well, what about Hitler?
[00:17:21.137 --> 00:17:21.497]  You know, he...
[00:17:23.133 --> 00:17:26.595]  He said passion plays were very useful to show that Jews are bad.
[00:17:27.115 --> 00:17:29.036]  Mel Gibson came back with the best answer.
[00:17:29.056 --> 00:17:29.757]  He's so smart.
[00:17:30.317 --> 00:17:31.858]  He said Hitler was an occultist.
[00:17:32.178 --> 00:17:33.678]  Hitler was a devil worshipper.
[00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:37.180]  That's what I say to people who call into this show and like Hitler.
[00:17:37.921 --> 00:17:39.581]  Hitler was a devil worshipper.
[00:17:39.842 --> 00:17:41.662]  Hitler was part of the fool society.
[00:17:42.003 --> 00:17:46.385]  Hitler was part of these shell and bones organizations that were founded in Germany.
[00:17:47.966 --> 00:17:48.926]  That's the facts.
[00:17:49.586 --> 00:17:52.548]  And 99% of people you talk to don't know that about Hitler.
[00:17:53.678 --> 00:17:59.801]  In fact, the ADL and others prance around talking about how Hitler was an example of Christianity targeting Jews.
[00:18:00.181 --> 00:18:01.181]  And I resent that.
[00:18:01.321 --> 00:18:05.483]  I resent them saying a devil worshiper represents Christians.
[00:18:07.344 --> 00:18:09.585]  Adolf Hitler was an occultist.
[00:18:11.906 --> 00:18:22.690]  And you notice you don't hear the ADL going after George Bush and John Kerry, who were members of an organization, Skull and Bones at Yale, part of the German Illuminati, who publicly...
[00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:24.190]  It's come out.
[00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:28.733]  Have Nazi flags and Hitler silverware and dine off of it.
[00:18:30.314 --> 00:18:32.735]  I mean, they were Nazis before Hitler was even born.
[00:18:35.537 --> 00:18:51.626]  So that's the reality, my friends, of how crazy the mainstream media has gotten, where every form of debauchery and corruption and filth can be all over television, but somebody makes a wholesome film
[00:18:52.999 --> 00:18:58.605]  A historical film about the last 12 hours of Christ's life and is demonized for it.
[00:18:58.665 --> 00:19:09.256]  But it shows that the propaganda didn't work and it's blown up in their face and now they're having to back off because when people go see it, including Jews, they go, this is ridiculous.
[00:19:09.276 --> 00:19:10.517]  This isn't anti-Semitic.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.022]  You know, Jesus Christ was...
[00:19:15.911 --> 00:19:39.111]  Was a Jew, and he was killed by the corrupt 501c3 government-run churches of the day, which is what we're fighting today, in the Protestant church, in the Catholic church, with all of our institutions being taken over by these people, being taken over by the Pharisees of today, whether they're Jewish or German or Chinese, being taken over by establishment lackeys.
[00:19:41.605 --> 00:19:45.228]  So if you want to talk about the primetime piece, you're welcome to.
[00:19:45.908 --> 00:19:54.074]  But notice that a lot of what Mel Gibson had to say that was really important didn't make it into the cut.
[00:19:55.375 --> 00:19:56.476]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:19:56.977 --> 00:19:57.417]  Stay with us.
[00:20:00.746 --> 00:20:04.349]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.

[00:21:00.911 --> 00:21:04.794]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:21:05.034 --> 00:21:10.478]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:21:10.738 --> 00:21:21.105]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:21:21.285 --> 00:21:25.628]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:21:25.808 --> 00:21:34.193]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:21:34.433 --> 00:21:40.776]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:21:40.916 --> 00:21:41.136]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:22:00.914 --> 00:22:03.816]  We've all heard the ads for lower prices on airfare and hotel.
[00:22:03.836 --> 00:22:05.798]  Oh yeah, the dot-coms are endless.
[00:22:05.998 --> 00:22:11.642]  CheaperHotels.com, SaveOnYourRentalCar.com, HalfPriceAirlineTickets.com.
[00:22:11.702 --> 00:22:17.486]  Problem is, by the time you get done planning your vacation, you've visited dozens of websites and spent hours and hours trying to save money.

[00:24:06.077 --> 00:24:07.718]  I don't know what I'd do without my wife.
[00:24:08.547 --> 00:24:13.350]  She called me during the break and said, Honey, I didn't take the entire primetime piece.
[00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:18.694]  I guess a few minutes of it, VCR was stopped or something.
[00:24:18.934 --> 00:24:26.439]  They did leave the quote in about the weapons of mass destruction, which I couldn't imagine how they wouldn't, so I guess I was wrong when I predicted they wouldn't.
[00:24:26.459 --> 00:24:31.262]  You know, out of three and a half hours of an interview, only 15 minutes of it or so.
[00:24:31.282 --> 00:24:34.644]  I mean, what an amazing quote that Mel Gibson was going to hide out
[00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:40.333]  In a tent next to the weapons of mass destruction after this movie comes out.
[00:24:40.733 --> 00:24:41.954]  And that quote was in there.
[00:24:42.094 --> 00:24:44.615]  So now, of course, I don't have it on tape.
[00:24:44.735 --> 00:24:46.216]  I have most of the interview on tape.
[00:24:46.396 --> 00:24:49.598]  Hopefully, if somebody's got it, you'll send it to me.
[00:24:50.319 --> 00:24:56.922]  But if you do have any comments about this primetime piece that aired last night, you can call us at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:25:01.367 --> 00:25:04.088]  So, again, that's something I'm happy to be wrong about.
[00:25:04.748 --> 00:25:11.070]  When I said yesterday that I didn't think that they would put that quote in there, and they did.
[00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:18.952]  And so I didn't talk to my wife about the show this morning, and then I was on air going, well, they didn't put that in there.
[00:25:19.192 --> 00:25:22.013]  And then she calls me and goes, no, we just didn't record the whole thing.
[00:25:22.093 --> 00:25:24.814]  It was in there because she watched it live when it aired.
[00:25:25.952 --> 00:25:28.033]  So I'm glad to be wrong about that.
[00:25:28.073 --> 00:25:32.534]  I'm glad that the CFR member, Diane Sawyer, did not cut that out.
[00:25:34.354 --> 00:25:37.915]  I'm going to hide out next to the weapons of mass destruction where nobody can find me.
[00:25:37.935 --> 00:25:42.436]  You know, I wouldn't count Lord Bush out yet.
[00:25:42.476 --> 00:25:45.397]  They may dig up those weapons of mass destruction any day, though.
[00:25:45.837 --> 00:25:51.118]  They just dug up a mig last week, and I have no doubt that Saddam didn't have some of those weapons.
[00:25:51.178 --> 00:25:51.538]  In fact...
[00:25:52.516 --> 00:26:00.718]  The UN had been to hundreds of sites, declared the sites of weapons of mass destruction, so there are weapons of mass destruction in the country.
[00:26:00.998 --> 00:26:06.159]  They just can't use that against Saddam because I have video of those weapons of mass destruction with U.S.
[00:26:06.319 --> 00:26:07.420]  markings on them.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:17.082]  All right, we'll go to the loaded phones, Jay and Gary and many others that are patiently holding, and then we'll get back into the news.
[00:26:17.702 --> 00:26:19.703]  Let's talk to Jay in Colorado.
[00:26:19.783 --> 00:26:20.623]  Jay, you're on the air.
[00:26:20.683 --> 00:26:21.043]  Go ahead.
[00:26:22.088 --> 00:26:29.010]  Yeah, Alex, I was just thinking, when I was in high school, you know about that channel one the kids are watching?
[00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:31.351]  I remember they had it when I was in high school.
[00:26:31.691 --> 00:26:33.131]  They had it when I was in high school.
[00:26:33.211 --> 00:26:36.792]  Demonizing guns, pro-world government, yes.
[00:26:37.192 --> 00:26:40.733]  Yeah, I can't remember what was on it, but I remember it all being a lot of politics.
[00:26:42.094 --> 00:26:44.214]  So isn't that what they do in them other countries?
[00:26:45.375 --> 00:26:47.215]  They can only watch what they want them to watch?
[00:26:48.676 --> 00:26:50.036]  Basically, that's it, yes.
[00:26:52.887 --> 00:27:00.693]  But it doesn't really matter, Jay, because almost every channel you flip to has the same propaganda script that they're reading off of.
[00:27:01.353 --> 00:27:02.214]  No, I agree with you.
[00:27:02.254 --> 00:27:06.858]  I'm just saying my point is that they're doing it in this country to our kids now.
[00:27:07.578 --> 00:27:08.939]  Well, they're doing it to adults, too.
[00:27:08.959 --> 00:27:19.587]  If you watch the nightly news at 5.30 on ABC, CBS, and NBC, it's generally the same stories in the same order with the same sponsors.
[00:27:20.448 --> 00:27:21.609]  No, I agree with you, yeah.
[00:27:22.853 --> 00:27:27.794]  It seems to me we're criticizing other countries for doing it, but I don't want to hear.
[00:27:28.174 --> 00:27:28.574]  I hear you.
[00:27:28.594 --> 00:27:29.494]  Thanks for the call, Jay.
[00:27:29.994 --> 00:27:31.735]  Let's talk to Gary in Ohio.
[00:27:31.775 --> 00:27:32.515]  Gary, go ahead.
[00:27:32.535 --> 00:27:33.615]  Hi, Alex.
[00:27:33.635 --> 00:27:34.315]  How are you doing?
[00:27:34.375 --> 00:27:34.675]  Good.
[00:27:34.976 --> 00:27:37.376]  Hey, a couple of quick thoughts on the interview last night.
[00:27:38.616 --> 00:27:39.476]  I watched the piece.
[00:27:39.496 --> 00:27:41.977]  I was actually very pleased with the results.
[00:27:42.017 --> 00:27:43.017]  I was surprised.
[00:27:44.477 --> 00:27:49.959]  I noticed that Diane Sawyer, I swear, she kept baiting him with these kind of questions, like the thing about Hitler and all that.
[00:27:50.639 --> 00:27:51.159]  And it's like...
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:56.302]  Well, you're coming up with some brilliant answers.
[00:27:57.482 --> 00:28:02.585]  Like you mentioned with the weapons of mass destruction.
[00:28:02.705 --> 00:28:06.527]  I wanted to hear what he had to say, but I really didn't want to hear what she had to say, you know?
[00:28:07.747 --> 00:28:12.730]  The questions were just, I don't know, was it me or some of the questions seemed like they were really off the wall?
[00:28:13.459 --> 00:28:18.685]  Well, they were, and it was an attempt to try to trap him, and I think that she failed miserably.
[00:28:18.705 --> 00:28:23.050]  And I hope somebody's got the full tape, because I just found out we didn't even tape the whole thing.
[00:28:24.411 --> 00:28:28.456]  And so, you know, I'd like to have that on tape, that weapons of mass destruction comment.
[00:28:29.036 --> 00:28:29.917]  That was brilliant.
[00:28:30.017 --> 00:28:30.358]  I really...
[00:28:30.778 --> 00:28:34.541]  I just laughed so hard when you said that because the look on his face and everything.
[00:28:34.561 --> 00:28:37.322]  Well, you'll see it when you see the tape.
[00:28:37.362 --> 00:28:48.870]  I mean, yesterday, and I'm rarely wrong, but I was predicting, I said that Diane Sawyer would probably not put that clip in there, and of course I couldn't tell you what the clip was because I didn't want to steal his lines.
[00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:58.756]  But notice the parts that I did see, that I did get taped, is where you have Foxman saying that
[00:28:59.578 --> 00:29:01.439]  They're not saying Mel Gibson's anti-Semitic.
[00:29:01.479 --> 00:29:04.020]  And then Mel Gibson goes, well, that's funny.
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:09.622]  All I've seen is these people saying this, and now they're having to back off.
[00:29:09.962 --> 00:29:19.606]  So Mr. Foxman is a liar because I've read his press releases where he said that Mel Gibson's bad and Mel Gibson's an anti-Semite and he's sure of it and there can be no doubt of it.
[00:29:20.006 --> 00:29:24.188]  Why do you think the ADL is now being forced to back off?
[00:29:27.429 --> 00:29:28.790]  That was a question for you, Gary.
[00:29:29.463 --> 00:29:29.723]  Yeah.
[00:29:30.423 --> 00:29:33.225]  Unless he's, like, somebody who's getting pressure on him or something.
[00:29:33.245 --> 00:29:34.325]  But you notice they love Arnold.
[00:29:35.225 --> 00:29:36.106]  They love Arnold, yeah.
[00:29:36.126 --> 00:29:37.286]  Yeah, it's just weird.
[00:29:37.446 --> 00:29:38.487]  Anyway, thanks, Alex.
[00:29:38.767 --> 00:29:40.248]  All right, appreciate the call.

[00:29:54.093 --> 00:29:57.695]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.036 --> 00:30:05.020]  Are you concerned about the quality of air and purity of water in your household?

[00:31:01.929 --> 00:31:03.690]  Jack Browning for Midas Resources.
[00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:07.631]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[00:31:08.131 --> 00:31:08.792]  Let's update.
[00:31:09.312 --> 00:31:13.073]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[00:31:13.433 --> 00:31:17.055]  The NASDAQ in that same time frame is flat.
[00:31:17.819 --> 00:31:18.760]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.102]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[00:31:21.623 --> 00:31:22.543]  Today, the U.S.
[00:31:22.563 --> 00:31:24.786]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[00:31:25.206 --> 00:31:26.727]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:31:27.288 --> 00:31:29.290]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283.
[00:31:30.631 --> 00:31:35.495]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[00:31:36.496 --> 00:31:37.257]  Gold is moving.
[00:31:37.497 --> 00:31:38.658]  Equities are treading water.
[00:31:39.059 --> 00:31:41.741]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[00:31:42.262 --> 00:31:43.583]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[00:31:44.042 --> 00:31:45.763]  Physical possession, private gold.
[00:31:46.183 --> 00:31:48.144]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[00:31:48.544 --> 00:31:50.665]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[00:31:52.846 --> 00:31:54.987]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.
[00:31:55.367 --> 00:31:55.667]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:32:00.242 --> 00:32:00.682]  We're good to go.
[00:32:15.247 --> 00:32:15.987]  We're good to go.
[00:32:44.146 --> 00:32:46.027]  All right, it's wide open phones.
[00:33:13.336 --> 00:33:13.736]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:14.037 --> 00:33:18.680]  Let's go back to the calls.
[00:33:19.221 --> 00:33:20.762]  Heather in Colorado, you're on the air.
[00:33:20.822 --> 00:33:21.243]  Go ahead.
[00:33:21.943 --> 00:33:28.308]  Yeah, Alex, I just wanted to say that I admire your dedication to fighting this war.
[00:33:28.889 --> 00:33:39.498]  Yeah, I mean, in the media, it's like everything that is platinum and everything that is big on music or movies always has to be changed to the media.
[00:33:40.242 --> 00:33:48.865]  And there's like a lot of music and also movies that people are making to try to come out with this issue.
[00:33:48.905 --> 00:34:04.970]  Like one is Immortal Technique is a hip-hop artist and he's out trying to get the word out and I just think it's really funny how the media just tries to keep these people underground.
[00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:09.151]  I mean, everybody in America are social butterflies, you know?
[00:34:09.921 --> 00:34:12.623]  And what do you mean by social butterflies?
[00:34:12.683 --> 00:34:16.124]  Like they just, they're like, oh, did you see Survivor?
[00:34:16.785 --> 00:34:17.825]  You know, who cares?
[00:34:17.905 --> 00:34:19.987]  I mean, I don't care about that.
[00:34:20.027 --> 00:34:31.993]  I'm into the issues, the real issues, and I don't understand why the majority, I mean, I'm young, you know, so I'm like only 20, so the people that are my age, I mean, they're not even, they don't even care, they don't even know what's going on.
[00:34:32.033 --> 00:34:33.574]  They don't even care about the election.
[00:34:34.074 --> 00:34:35.475]  And I think that's a big problem.
[00:34:35.515 --> 00:34:36.936]  I think if people would just,
[00:34:37.935 --> 00:34:43.559]  Research and not only look at what's in front of them and try to actually think for themselves.
[00:34:44.359 --> 00:34:47.641]  You know, it would be a better place here, you know?
[00:34:48.182 --> 00:35:02.511]  It would be, but I mean, it shows how sick the society is, how psychologically ill we are, that there's been this mainstream media attack on the Passion of Christ, Mel Gibson's new movie that's coming out next week.
[00:35:03.146 --> 00:35:04.127]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:04.307 --> 00:35:11.074]  Whereas at the very same time, every form of aberrant behavior is promoted in the media, and that's okay.
[00:35:11.575 --> 00:35:21.745]  It shows how the Hollywood elite and the cultural elite are so far removed from the general public and how they're trying to push their agenda on us.
[00:35:22.794 --> 00:35:25.677]  Right, and that's what I'm worried about.
[00:35:25.697 --> 00:35:26.618]  It's like The Running Man.
[00:35:26.658 --> 00:35:27.879]  You seen the movie The Running Man?
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:28.800]  Yes, I have.
[00:35:29.141 --> 00:35:36.649]  I mean, it's really scary, because that movie was made a while ago, but now that I watch it, I'm like, you know, this could really happen.
[00:35:36.689 --> 00:35:42.715]  I mean, these reality shows, and everybody's so sick with these reality shows, and everybody's so absorbed by these...
[00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:46.071]  Social, like, oh, look what Janet Jackson did.
[00:35:46.131 --> 00:35:47.252]  Look at Michael Jackson.
[00:35:47.552 --> 00:35:57.016]  But then Bush is getting subpoenaed because he's not cooperating with giving files about the 9-11 report, you know, and also about his military record.
[00:35:57.036 --> 00:35:58.016]  But nobody cares about that.
[00:35:58.717 --> 00:36:03.959]  Well, a lot of people do care, but the media creates the illusion that people don't care.
[00:36:03.999 --> 00:36:07.521]  So then a lot of weak-minded people kind of pile onto that whole worldview.
[00:36:07.541 --> 00:36:09.001]  Thanks for the call, Heather.
[00:36:10.302 --> 00:36:13.123]  And there's wheels within wheels within wheels
[00:36:14.452 --> 00:36:21.527]  The 9-11 Commission, two of the members on it have had to secretly testify because, according to the Washington Post, they were involved in 9-11 somehow.
[00:36:23.715 --> 00:36:31.860]  We've got one of the Democrat members who left the committee, who Bush gave the chairmanship of the import-export bank, so a public payoff.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:46.728]  We've got the head of the commission saying that they're not there to find guilt, they're just there to decide what they can do in the war on terror, and so their suggestions so far have been for more government funding, more loss of liberty.
[00:36:48.028 --> 00:36:52.471]  So with a 9-11 commission, they're just acting like they're in some type of fight with Bush,
[00:36:53.261 --> 00:36:55.189]  It's more Shakespearean theater.
[00:36:56.221 --> 00:36:58.702]  So I would hope that people would see through that.
[00:36:59.162 --> 00:37:05.005]  But getting back to the passion just briefly, I'm glad that I was wrong because I said, you know, I bet.
[00:37:05.065 --> 00:37:07.826]  I didn't say I'm sure, but I said I would guess.
[00:37:08.566 --> 00:37:18.570]  I would place my bets on Diane Sawyer not using Mel Gibson's quote that, well, you know, I think when this movie comes out, I'm just going to go hide somewhere because of all the pressure.
[00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:21.571]  I think I'll pitch a tent next to the weapons of mass destruction.
[00:37:21.951 --> 00:37:23.412]  I thought that that wouldn't be in the piece.
[00:37:24.883 --> 00:37:28.625]  And then, again, I taped it last night and didn't get that part taped, so I didn't even think it was in there.
[00:37:28.645 --> 00:37:30.947]  And then my wife called and said, no, I watched it live.
[00:37:31.007 --> 00:37:31.667]  It was in there.
[00:37:32.188 --> 00:37:33.328]  So that's very encouraging.
[00:37:33.909 --> 00:37:43.815]  And it's very encouraging that Mr. Foxman of the ADL and others are having to back off their slander, their libel against Mel Gibson.
[00:37:44.096 --> 00:37:50.480]  Because, again, I've read the press releases where the ADL says there can no longer be any doubt Mel Gibson's an anti-Semite.
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:51.681]  This movie's anti-Semitic.
[00:37:51.981 --> 00:37:53.342]  This movie should be boycotted.
[00:37:54.241 --> 00:37:58.723]  And they thought that they could defeat this movie and that the general public would buy their lies.
[00:37:59.363 --> 00:38:12.689]  But now that Mel Gibson has tromped from one end of the country to the other, showing people this film, and it's had such a massive effect on Christians, on Jews, on Muslims, you name it, and people are saying, why is the ADL mad about this?
[00:38:13.169 --> 00:38:14.349]  They're having to back off.
[00:38:16.931 --> 00:38:20.472]  So Foxman's having to change his story midstream.
[00:38:21.733 --> 00:38:22.593]  And that's a good thing.
[00:38:23.408 --> 00:38:28.613]  But some of us, you know, are unable to defend ourselves against the ADL.
[00:38:28.694 --> 00:38:35.600]  I mean, I've, again, never said anything about Jews or anything like that, and I've had the ADL attack me, and I'm sick of it.
[00:38:36.381 --> 00:38:40.345]  I mean, on the ADL website, they say Mr. Jones thinks the government carried out 9-11.
[00:38:42.014 --> 00:38:46.016]  And the headline is, you know, what are anti-Semites saying?
[00:38:46.076 --> 00:38:53.779]  And then down below it, they've got me mixed in with Bin Laden and all these other people, literally, on this big story they wrote right after 9-11.
[00:38:54.259 --> 00:38:58.801]  And it says, Mr. Jones, a popular Texas talk show host, thinks the government carried out 9-11.
[00:38:58.961 --> 00:39:04.083]  I mean, I'm tired of this.
[00:39:07.518 --> 00:39:12.801]  What they're doing is they're out there stifling free speech because it's a horrible thing to say about somebody that they're anti-Semitic.
[00:39:13.361 --> 00:39:18.984]  And so basically the ADL is a rental agency for the government.
[00:39:19.204 --> 00:39:23.946]  They just rent them, basically, to go demonize innocent people that aren't doing anything wrong.
[00:39:25.587 --> 00:39:28.268]  You talk about defamation, that's what the ADL is all about.
[00:39:28.788 --> 00:39:30.729]  And I'm glad to see them having to back off here.
[00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:33.551]  And I don't want to spend all day on this.
[00:39:33.611 --> 00:39:33.991]  It's just...
[00:39:35.965 --> 00:39:41.308]  I've got all the FBI training manuals and news articles and law enforcement publications.
[00:39:41.328 --> 00:39:42.748]  We talked a lot about this yesterday.
[00:39:42.808 --> 00:39:47.471]  And they say, you know, talking about the Federal Reserve is code for anti-Semitism.
[00:39:47.871 --> 00:39:51.933]  Talking about the militarization of police is code for anti-Semitism.
[00:39:52.273 --> 00:39:56.555]  Talking about a New World Order is code for anti-Semitism.
[00:39:57.335 --> 00:40:02.818]  And then, you know, I get on the air and talk about the New World Order, which the Supreme Court and the President and everybody else are announcing.
[00:40:03.622 --> 00:40:09.864]  And, you know, the Pope's calling for, and the average person driving along in their car goes, well, wait a minute, I heard that's code.
[00:40:10.164 --> 00:40:11.365]  Oh, no, it's not code.
[00:40:11.645 --> 00:40:14.286]  And making a movie about Jesus Christ isn't bad.
[00:40:14.926 --> 00:40:24.089]  Again, I mean, I don't have words to describe how crazy this is that the media acts like it's, ooh, this dangerous movie about Jesus.
[00:40:24.489 --> 00:40:25.850]  Ooh, what are we going to do?
[00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:28.671]  Oh, my goodness, this is so bad.
[00:40:29.601 --> 00:40:35.303]  And all the demonization we've seen over the last six months, now they're having to back off because it didn't work.
[00:40:35.403 --> 00:40:46.526]  It shows that when we get behind something good and don't turn tail and deny it, you know, like Thomas did, that in the end we're going to win, folks.
[00:40:47.906 --> 00:40:49.607]  Let's talk to Roger in Pennsylvania.
[00:40:49.667 --> 00:40:50.507]  Roger, go ahead.
[00:40:51.367 --> 00:40:52.027]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:40:52.047 --> 00:40:54.168]  That was such a superbly funny line.
[00:40:54.228 --> 00:40:57.089]  Well, just to make sure I've never found Touche Mel.
[00:40:58.833 --> 00:41:02.395]  I wish I had that on tape, because obviously I didn't record the whole show.
[00:41:02.455 --> 00:41:03.635]  I watched it and didn't see that.
[00:41:03.976 --> 00:41:06.117]  But I'm glad that I'm wrong, because I predicted.
[00:41:06.477 --> 00:41:07.317]  I didn't make a prediction.
[00:41:07.357 --> 00:41:09.778]  I said, she probably won't put that in there.
[00:41:10.238 --> 00:41:10.959]  But they did.
[00:41:11.019 --> 00:41:11.899]  Why do you think they did that?
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:13.660]  Oh, well, who knows.
[00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:26.706]  But also on a lighter note, one thing we must not accuse the enemies of Mel or the enemies of the gospel more broadly of is that of invincible ignorance.
[00:41:27.338 --> 00:41:39.726]  Because now finally after, what, 20, 50, 100, 1,000 years, they finally decoded the distinctives of the Roman Catholic, if not the Christian faith totally.
[00:41:41.988 --> 00:41:42.848]  It's just so funny.
[00:41:42.888 --> 00:41:44.269]  Nobody makes that observation.
[00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:48.012]  Perhaps I'm a little bit dense, but I don't understand.
[00:41:48.032 --> 00:41:54.496]  Well, it's as though they finally discovered the distinctives of the Christian faith, you know, now that they can finally criticize them properly.
[00:41:55.016 --> 00:41:56.758]  And it's notable that,
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:04.112]  We're finally getting a little truth in advertising here because she built this panel of interfaith scholars.
[00:42:05.074 --> 00:42:08.822]  Notably, she didn't say a panel of scholars from different faiths.
[00:42:10.199 --> 00:42:14.200]  So in other words, these are all basically apostates from their respective faiths.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.021]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:42:15.061 --> 00:42:22.043]  They're merging the religions into this new world religion that Kofi Annan called for on September 12th.
[00:42:22.083 --> 00:42:28.185]  He said, we must have a world religion, and the UN is calling for banning criticizing any one religion.
[00:42:28.765 --> 00:42:33.267]  I noticed she didn't add to that panel any Orthodox scholars from any faiths.
[00:42:35.644 --> 00:42:37.926]  That would be anathema to her purpose.
[00:42:37.966 --> 00:42:39.628]  What did you think of Foxman?
[00:42:39.648 --> 00:42:41.209]  I mean, he's normally pretty aggressive.
[00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:43.271]  He looked like a deer in the headlights.
[00:42:43.792 --> 00:43:01.208]  I'm glad you brought that up because I think basically the reason he backed off is now finally that the movie has come out, he better shut up because he's going to lose even his milquetoast liberal Jewish supporters because they'll see he's the fool of it if he doesn't.
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.281]  Conveniently forget what he said.
[00:43:03.321 --> 00:43:04.081]  Well, that's it.
[00:43:04.562 --> 00:43:05.182]  I mean, that's it.
[00:43:05.242 --> 00:43:14.548]  It's easy for the FBI or the Southern Poverty Law Center or the ADL to demonize some little-known person and to persecute them and lie about them.
[00:43:14.868 --> 00:43:16.509]  But they went up against Mel Gibson.
[00:43:16.809 --> 00:43:24.794]  Mel Gibson went coast to coast, showed the film, and Jews, Gentiles, you name it, saw it and said, what is the big deal?
[00:43:24.955 --> 00:43:26.135]  Why are they saying this?
[00:43:26.916 --> 00:43:30.198]  So Foxman has really blown his foot off.
[00:43:30.838 --> 00:43:33.980]  Lastly, Mel acquitted himself superbly well.
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:43.985]  The only thing I heard him say that I had a quibble with was about we're all children of God, whereas the Bible teaches that we're either children of God or of our father, the devil.
[00:43:44.866 --> 00:43:45.646]  God bless Alex.
[00:43:46.167 --> 00:43:47.427]  All right, thanks for the call.
[00:43:47.447 --> 00:43:49.208]  Well, there's no telling what they edited, too.
[00:43:49.228 --> 00:43:50.729]  I mean, that thing was highly edited.
[00:43:51.509 --> 00:43:57.453]  A three-and-a-half-hour interview, and it turns into, I don't know, how many minutes of it, 15 minutes of it, were Mel?
[00:43:59.114 --> 00:43:59.594]  Again...
[00:44:00.473 --> 00:44:03.036]  I was busy working last night and didn't get the whole thing recorded.
[00:44:04.117 --> 00:44:04.678]  I thought I did.
[00:44:04.718 --> 00:44:08.423]  I guess my wife got it recorded from a commercial point where it looked like the start of it.
[00:44:09.083 --> 00:44:12.547]  So I got to put my foot in my mouth, which is a little good thing.
[00:44:12.928 --> 00:44:13.809]  Occasionally I do it.
[00:44:13.829 --> 00:44:14.890]  I get to announce it on air.
[00:44:15.511 --> 00:44:18.334]  But I'm just glad that they put that weapons of mass destruction comment in there.
[00:44:18.915 --> 00:44:19.796]  That's great.
[00:44:21.562 --> 00:44:24.964]  Mel Gibson's known as a conservative, and they're always trying to make it a left-right issue.
[00:44:25.425 --> 00:44:38.014]  Whereas you've got Ron Paul saying the Iraq war is a fraud, and a lot of other real conservatives that have real conservative voting records, but the neocon media only focuses on mindless liberals criticizing the war for the wrong reasons.
[00:44:38.654 --> 00:44:41.356]  Oh, the UN isn't the boss of the war, so we're against it.
[00:44:42.123 --> 00:44:44.885]  And again, that's all good cop, bad cop psychology.
[00:44:45.706 --> 00:44:48.448]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Tennessee.
[00:44:48.548 --> 00:44:49.369]  John, go ahead.
[00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:55.054]  When talking about anti-Semitism, the intelligent thing to do is to define the word Semite.
[00:44:55.634 --> 00:44:58.016]  Every dictionary defines Semite as an Arab.
[00:44:58.437 --> 00:45:01.779]  And Ralph Nader is an Arab from Lebanon on C-SPAN.
[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:09.846]  He said it's time we start talking about, quote, the other anti-Semitism, unquote, of Israel attacking the Palestinians and Arabs.
[00:45:10.427 --> 00:45:14.329]  Well, there was, again, a college professor out in California.
[00:45:14.789 --> 00:45:20.853]  All he said was is that some of the Palestinians are being mistreated, and that's certainly happening.
[00:45:20.893 --> 00:45:22.774]  I mean, it's a race war going on over there.
[00:45:22.814 --> 00:45:24.054]  Both sides are killing each other.
[00:45:24.074 --> 00:45:27.436]  And the ADL is trying to get him fired right now.
[00:45:27.977 --> 00:45:29.678]  I mean, is this a free country or not?
[00:45:30.158 --> 00:45:30.378]  No.
[00:45:30.558 --> 00:45:31.719]  Well, it never has been.
[00:45:31.739 --> 00:45:35.961]  Nader said a Jew is not a Semite when a Jew lives in Europe or America.
[00:45:36.522 --> 00:45:36.982]  I hear you.
[00:45:37.042 --> 00:45:38.223]  Thanks for the call, John.
[00:45:38.263 --> 00:45:42.264]  Look, my whole point is that, and I've read literally hundreds of articles about the passion
[00:46:06.252 --> 00:46:09.193]  That when Jews go see the movie, they go, what's the big deal?
[00:46:09.973 --> 00:46:17.415]  I mean, I think it's unfair to let the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the ADL represent Jews.
[00:46:18.555 --> 00:46:20.256]  Because, you know, I have Jewish friends.
[00:46:21.336 --> 00:46:23.416]  And they can't stand the ADL.
[00:46:23.436 --> 00:46:28.778]  The ADL is a tool of the federal government to demonize people that stand up against the New World Order.
[00:46:29.118 --> 00:46:30.658]  They want to make it a racial issue.
[00:46:31.719 --> 00:46:33.159]  It's the same thing with the open borders.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:48.544]  You've got all these old rich white men who want open borders to drive down the wages and to balkanize the country, and they finance the textbooks and the flyers down in Mexico for the last 30 years that say the Southwest belongs to Mexico.
[00:46:49.564 --> 00:47:02.747]  And they're trying to create the balkanization, whereas in major polls, the majority of Hispanics don't want an open border, and they know it's bad for the economy, and they know it's bad for America, but the media tries to say, oh, Hispanics want an open border.
[00:47:03.906 --> 00:47:05.628]  Again, trying to make it a racial issue.
[00:47:05.908 --> 00:47:10.112]  Then if you're against an open border, well, you must hate Hispanics, which isn't true.
[00:47:11.152 --> 00:47:16.417]  So, I mean, look, the globalists in Africa will play one African tribe off against another.
[00:47:17.458 --> 00:47:31.430]  The globalists will play Protestants off against Catholics, Catholics off against Protestants in Northern Ireland, while the British government goes around blowing stuff up to keep everybody at each other's throats for a pretext for military occupation in Northern Ireland by the British military.
[00:47:32.449 --> 00:47:37.170]  We get into that in the book, Order Out of Chaos, that I published, that Paul Watson wrote.
[00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:38.770]  And that's admitted.
[00:47:39.471 --> 00:47:40.891]  It's the same thing in Europe.
[00:47:40.911 --> 00:47:42.591]  They'll play one country off against another.
[00:47:42.851 --> 00:47:44.872]  They play different classes off against each other.
[00:47:45.252 --> 00:47:47.912]  This is balkanization, divide and conquer.
[00:47:47.952 --> 00:47:48.593]  It's real simple.
[00:47:49.113 --> 00:47:51.513]  And it's time that we stop allowing this to happen.
[00:47:52.013 --> 00:47:59.095]  And whether it's an evil black person or an evil Jew or an evil German running an institution, we need to be able to expose them.
[00:47:59.555 --> 00:48:07.037]  And not have somebody come yelling, oh, you're against open borders, you're against Mexicans, you're a racist.
[00:48:07.457 --> 00:48:12.458]  Or, oh, you don't like the ADL demonizing the passion, so you must be anti-Semitic.
[00:48:13.198 --> 00:48:14.838]  We need to stop putting up with this.
[00:48:14.898 --> 00:48:15.979]  This is how they control us.
[00:48:16.799 --> 00:48:20.179]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Ohio.
[00:48:20.259 --> 00:48:21.000]  Joe, go ahead.
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:21.800]  Hi, Alex.
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:22.460]  How are you doing?
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:22.900]  Good, sir.
[00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:24.020]  Great, thank you.
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:27.261]  In yesterday's show, I just wanted to comment.
[00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:35.357]  There's a book out by Charles Van Wick, and it's entitled Shooting Back the Right and Duty of Self-Defense.
[00:48:35.977 --> 00:48:37.679]  And I'd like to read a scripture from this.
[00:48:37.779 --> 00:48:39.340]  It's a new international version.
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:45.206]  Well, for those that just joined us, there was an ABC News report where the big Presbyterian church...
[00:48:46.111 --> 00:48:49.993]  Well, this book deals with the fact that this guy was sitting in a church in South Africa that deals with the St.
[00:48:50.033 --> 00:48:52.634]  James Massacre in, I believe it was 1993.
[00:49:14.076 --> 00:49:20.258]  And nobody in the church had a gun when terrorists came in and just started blowing Christians away in the church.
[00:49:20.838 --> 00:49:30.341]  But the subtitle, The Right and Duty of Self-Defense, and he has a couple of scriptures in here that I'd like to read.
[00:49:30.381 --> 00:49:32.042]  Well, two that I'd like to read, if I may.
[00:49:32.282 --> 00:49:33.042]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:49:33.202 --> 00:49:40.284]  If a thief is caught breaking and is struck so that he dies, the defender is not guilty of bloodshed.
[00:49:40.344 --> 00:49:41.345]  This is in Exodus 22.2.
[00:49:43.462 --> 00:49:50.964]  And one of my favorites, like a muddied spring or a polluted well, is a righteous man who gives way to the wicked.
[00:49:51.324 --> 00:49:52.364]  That's in Proverbs 25, 26.
[00:49:52.504 --> 00:49:55.544]  Look, it's real simple.
[00:49:55.664 --> 00:49:56.385]  It's real simple.
[00:49:56.465 --> 00:50:02.206]  If you love your wife and children, you will defend them, and that's what a man is supposed to do.
[00:50:02.526 --> 00:50:11.468]  And these people that say that we shouldn't own guns, we shouldn't defend our families, well, they should move to New York or Chicago where the guns are banned and they have the highest crime rate in the country.
[00:50:11.708 --> 00:50:13.168]  Well, I call them gunophobics.
[00:50:14.003 --> 00:50:17.206]  You know, they're afraid of guns because they don't understand.
[00:50:17.226 --> 00:50:17.927]  Well, wait, wait, wait.
[00:50:17.967 --> 00:50:25.334]  They're gunophobics unless it's black ski mask police riding along in an armored vehicle ransacking somebody's home.
[00:50:25.674 --> 00:50:29.538]  They love it when Hitler or Stalin or Mao has guns.
[00:50:29.858 --> 00:50:32.080]  They don't like it when the citizens have guns.
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:35.603]  So these gunophobics are just phobic of citizens owning guns.
[00:50:35.763 --> 00:50:38.646]  Right, and they'll use anything against us as a pretext.
[00:50:39.933 --> 00:50:41.114]  Great points, Joe.
[00:50:41.134 --> 00:50:41.774]  Good to hear from you.
[00:50:41.814 --> 00:50:42.934]  Bill and others, you're up next.
[00:50:43.114 --> 00:50:44.335]  Wide open phones today.
[00:50:44.815 --> 00:50:46.195]  Any issue you want to discuss, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:46.215 --> 00:50:46.796]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:46.836 --> 00:50:49.777]  And yeah, there's a lot of news coming up as well.
[00:50:49.797 --> 00:50:50.177]  Stay with us.
[00:50:50.237 --> 00:50:51.618]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:02.492]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:02.873 --> 00:51:08.617]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:51:08.857 --> 00:51:14.001]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:51:14.342 --> 00:51:23.609]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:51:23.969 --> 00:51:28.911]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:51:29.251 --> 00:51:33.252]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:51:33.452 --> 00:51:38.214]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:51:38.594 --> 00:51:44.476]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:51:44.836 --> 00:51:53.864]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[00:52:00.769 --> 00:52:05.073]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:52:05.293 --> 00:52:09.637]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:52:12.675 --> 00:52:15.698]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:52:17.399 --> 00:52:21.622]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:52:21.683 --> 00:52:28.628]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:52:28.748 --> 00:52:30.750]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:52:30.990 --> 00:52:41.456]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:52:41.736 --> 00:52:47.100]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:53:02.552 --> 00:53:08.035]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:53:08.456 --> 00:53:12.698]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:53:12.938 --> 00:53:19.962]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:53:20.343 --> 00:53:26.446]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:53:26.466 --> 00:53:27.807]  There are no side effects.
[00:53:27.967 --> 00:53:30.349]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[00:53:49.362 --> 00:53:49.622]  Call today.
[00:53:49.702 --> 00:53:51.142]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:53:51.162 --> 00:53:52.883]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:16.656 --> 00:54:17.216]  All right.
[00:54:21.758 --> 00:54:29.941]  Joe in Ohio and Bill and Marlene, Dominique, Don, Victor, everybody, your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:54:32.222 --> 00:54:33.903]  Two GIs, a U.S.
[00:54:33.943 --> 00:54:35.784]  civilian, killed in Iraq.
[00:54:37.244 --> 00:54:39.265]  Roadside bombs killed two U.S.
[00:54:39.305 --> 00:54:40.305]  soldiers in Iraq.
[00:54:40.346 --> 00:54:43.867]  American civilian killed in ambush south of Baghdad.
[00:54:45.111 --> 00:54:53.136]  The deaths of troops, our troops, Iraqi forces that work for the globalists, are accelerating.
[00:54:54.997 --> 00:55:00.661]  And the government wants to go into Syria and Iran and a bunch of other countries now.
[00:55:01.821 --> 00:55:02.602]  And for what?
[00:55:02.882 --> 00:55:06.464]  The PNAC documents written by Dick Cheney and others say it's about oil.
[00:55:07.965 --> 00:55:09.066]  And it's a real tragedy.
[00:55:09.761 --> 00:55:11.462]  So we can get your take on that as well.
[00:55:11.882 --> 00:55:15.685]  Also out of the Star Bulletin, I already told you about this, but here it is in another news report.
[00:55:16.425 --> 00:55:19.047]  Genealogists call Bush and Kerry kin.
[00:55:20.227 --> 00:55:24.910]  Big Isle researchers claim the president and his top opponent are distant cousins.
[00:55:25.931 --> 00:55:32.935]  Well, Reuters says they're third cousins, and at the same time, NPR says they're distant cousins.
[00:55:33.075 --> 00:55:34.436]  I don't know what the truth is, okay?
[00:55:35.337 --> 00:55:35.878]  I don't know.
[00:55:36.318 --> 00:55:37.638]  Perhaps we'll find out someday.
[00:55:38.019 --> 00:55:40.300]  I do know they're members of the same secret society.
[00:55:41.481 --> 00:55:47.184]  Same admitted occultic secret society, generational cult.
[00:55:48.204 --> 00:55:54.068]  Also, we'll get to Kerry would be the third richest man as president, third richest president in history.
[00:55:54.368 --> 00:55:59.931]  We'll get more into Bush's military records as his lies and new lies start contradicting each other.
[00:56:01.096 --> 00:56:04.839]  Also, the militarization of police, this from Business Wire.
[00:56:05.279 --> 00:56:08.962]  Surplus army vehicles find new life and error of homeland security.
[00:56:09.542 --> 00:56:12.044]  That's right, armored vehicles and tanks on your streets.
[00:56:12.664 --> 00:56:16.947]  New scholarship created for whites only, this from CNN.
[00:56:17.528 --> 00:56:23.432]  And the university, the group at the university, says they're doing this to point out the racism of affirmative action.
[00:56:23.572 --> 00:56:26.254]  That's just some of what's coming up.
[00:56:26.915 --> 00:56:28.596]  Before I go back to your calls...
[00:56:31.537 --> 00:56:36.778]  I do want to remind the listeners that I've made 10 full-length feature documentary films.
[00:56:39.419 --> 00:56:49.921]  The newest film is Matrix of Evil Exposed with Congressman Ron Paul getting into how globalists run Washington and solutions and who the neocons are.
[00:56:50.421 --> 00:56:56.382]  Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, who's a Democrat, talking about 9-11 and the UN-run white slavery rings.
[00:56:56.442 --> 00:56:58.102]  Frank Morales on the police state.
[00:56:58.502 --> 00:57:00.383]  Colonel Craig Roberts on the New World Order.
[00:57:00.483 --> 00:57:01.003]  Myself.
[00:57:02.228 --> 00:57:04.652]  Helping throw out the Patriot Act here in Austin.
[00:57:05.578 --> 00:57:08.759]  It's a video full of solutions and full of taking action.
[00:57:09.319 --> 00:57:10.799]  It's over two hours long.
[00:57:10.939 --> 00:57:13.140]  All the films are $25.95 apiece.
[00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:14.420]  Order three or more.
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:17.201]  They drop down to $20 apiece.
[00:57:17.741 --> 00:57:25.703]  And I would hope that everybody out there would stop procrastinating and would get the videos and make copies of them and get them out to opinion makers in your area.
[00:57:25.743 --> 00:57:32.845]  Because if we don't expose who the real terrorists are, that is the military industrial complex, they're going to carry out more terror
[00:57:33.725 --> 00:57:36.146]  To further expand their global empire.
[00:57:36.466 --> 00:57:41.006]  But there's no room for freedom or liberty or family or your faith.
[00:57:42.027 --> 00:57:47.528]  So the total free number to get the films, they're $25.95 a piece, $20 when you order three or more, is 1-888-253-3139.
[00:57:47.548 --> 00:57:47.788]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:58:00.050 --> 00:58:03.511]  Or Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:58:04.051 --> 00:58:05.012]  Or just write to me.
[00:58:05.132 --> 00:58:11.994]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:58:14.935 --> 00:58:19.296]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[00:58:19.776 --> 00:58:23.117]  When good people stand up and take action, evil will flourish.
[00:58:23.897 --> 00:58:25.978]  Walter, it will be defeated.
[00:58:26.458 --> 00:58:31.301]  But if we just sit here and say, there's nothing we can do, nobody cares, nobody's waking up.
[00:58:31.921 --> 00:58:37.804]  If we have that attitude, you can kiss your family, your freedom, America, the world goodbye.
[00:58:37.824 --> 00:58:42.286]  We're going to enter a second dark age run by the New World Order.
[00:58:42.806 --> 00:58:44.127]  Second hour straight ahead.
[00:58:44.647 --> 00:58:46.248]  Your calls and a ton of news.
[00:58:46.848 --> 00:58:48.589]  InfoWars.com is the website.
[00:58:51.247 --> 00:58:59.851]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:59:00.071 --> 00:59:11.356]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:59:11.576 --> 00:59:14.217]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:59:14.557 --> 00:59:21.020]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled, and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:23.041]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:59:23.241 --> 00:59:29.264]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[00:59:29.524 --> 00:59:35.187]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:59:35.507 --> 00:59:39.428]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:59:39.448 --> 00:59:40.169]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:59:40.189 --> 00:59:41.249]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:59:41.409 --> 00:59:41.689]  Big Brother.
[00:59:41.709 --> 00:59:42.829]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:42.869 --> 00:59:43.730]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:44.350]  You want answers?
[00:59:44.370 --> 00:59:45.110]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:03.789 --> 01:00:07.750]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:12.110]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.251 --> 01:00:16.331]  All right, my friends.
[01:00:16.591 --> 01:00:22.872]  Already into the second hour of this global transmission against tyranny.
[01:00:24.373 --> 01:00:32.254]  I rarely get sick, but it's my excuse for being a bit... I think the operative word is dingy today.
[01:00:33.539 --> 01:00:39.563]  I started getting a sore throat last night when I was working on a new film, and then I got home and didn't sleep too well.
[01:00:40.583 --> 01:00:46.867]  I'm sitting here on air running a fever right now with a raw throat.
[01:00:47.127 --> 01:00:51.049]  So just bear with me if I'm not my normal chipper self.
[01:00:55.031 --> 01:00:59.614]  I probably shouldn't even do a radio show if I'm sick because, again, I got home last night
[01:01:00.311 --> 01:01:11.100]  And my wife had taped Mel Gibson on the national show on ABC with Diane Sawyer, primetime, and I guess we hadn't taped the whole thing.
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:12.422]  And I'm like, yep, I knew it.
[01:01:12.462 --> 01:01:14.563]  They didn't talk about weapons of mass destruction, see?
[01:01:14.583 --> 01:01:17.846]  I knew she'd cut that out, and indeed it was in there.
[01:01:18.167 --> 01:01:20.769]  So that's encouraging, folks.
[01:01:21.743 --> 01:01:22.924]  We've got loaded phone lines.
[01:01:23.004 --> 01:01:27.946]  We've got Greg Powles coming up the next hour, BBC investigative reporter, best-selling author.
[01:01:28.406 --> 01:01:46.094]  We only had him on for 20 minutes the other day, and that kind of ran short, and we had more to talk about, so he'll be joining us to talk about Bush's real military record, and we'll also get into our government ordering the FBI not to stop Pakistan while they were busy proliferating weapons of mass destruction.
[01:01:47.839 --> 01:01:56.264]  So again, our government attacks innocent countries that haven't done anything wrong, and then helps arm and then proliferate weapons with real states that are threats.
[01:01:58.625 --> 01:01:59.706]  So that's coming up, too.
[01:02:00.546 --> 01:02:03.628]  Also, $58 million in property missing from NASA.
[01:02:04.949 --> 01:02:14.274]  Every day or two, I see articles of billions more missing from the Pentagon, or millions here, millions there, missing from other federal bureaucracies.
[01:02:15.730 --> 01:02:20.571]  Folks, there's $1.2 trillion.
[01:02:21.592 --> 01:02:35.195]  It's hard to even grasp that amount of money, but $1.2 trillion over the last nine years missing from the Pentagon under Bill Clinton and now accelerating under George Walker Bush.
[01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:47.398]  So when you hear about 58 million missing or 3 billion missing from the Pentagon, that doesn't even scratch the surface, but it's part of a culture of criminality in government, and we should all be concerned about it.
[01:02:47.979 --> 01:02:49.700]  Let's go ahead and go to Bill in Ohio.
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:50.621]  Bill, you're on the air.
[01:02:50.661 --> 01:02:51.101]  Go ahead.
[01:02:51.922 --> 01:02:52.402]  Yeah, Alex?
[01:02:52.802 --> 01:02:53.063]  Yes.
[01:02:53.763 --> 01:02:54.083]  All right.
[01:02:54.283 --> 01:03:05.432]  I was just wanting to say, you had a guy in yesterday talking about he was passing out videotapes, and now he's looking at a year in jail for doing that.
[01:03:06.391 --> 01:03:06.851]  Is that right?
[01:03:07.112 --> 01:03:17.459]  Yes, and I've got his number here, and I'm putting together the documents and the info in Kentucky, and he gave a cop a video, and the cop said, this video threatened me.
[01:03:18.059 --> 01:03:30.168]  They arrested him, and the judge said, you are guilty of giving a police officer an anti-government, anti-police video, so that shows you the Sovietization of the mindset of these people.
[01:03:31.189 --> 01:03:32.350]  Yeah, that's what I was getting at.
[01:03:33.578 --> 01:03:38.862]  The thing of it is, they do that kind of stuff because they get away with it, and nobody ever thinks to stop them.
[01:03:39.242 --> 01:03:50.751]  When you think of what Solzhenitsyn said when it happened in Russia, when they were coming for people and stuff, and how they burned in the camps and they realized they had nothing to lose anyway, they should have made sure some of them died that day.
[01:03:50.971 --> 01:03:51.612]  And I wonder...
[01:03:54.449 --> 01:03:56.551]  How these cops sleep with themselves.
[01:03:57.052 --> 01:03:58.654]  You know, how they go to bed at night.
[01:03:59.435 --> 01:04:03.139]  Because, you know, if I do something wrong, I mean, I have all these conscience pains.
[01:04:05.333 --> 01:04:07.634]  How did they... Look, I said this yesterday.
[01:04:07.654 --> 01:04:13.197]  I have the Law Enforcement Technology magazine from a few years ago, and it says, if you see a Get Us Out of the U.N.
[01:04:13.237 --> 01:04:20.160]  bumper sticker on a car, go ahead and take them into jail, and police chiefs, don't criticize your officers.
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.281]  These people are probably terrorists or criminals.
[01:04:22.601 --> 01:04:26.663]  I mean, how does a cop read that and not realize how un-American that is?
[01:04:27.303 --> 01:04:34.026]  Yeah, that's exactly right, but the point is, you know, if no one's willing to stand up when they come to your door...
[01:04:34.889 --> 01:04:40.736]  You know, when they come to take your kids or when they come to take you to jail for passing out videotapes, they're just going to keep doing it.
[01:04:42.017 --> 01:04:45.161]  Well, what they do is... Tell you what, stay there.
[01:04:45.201 --> 01:04:46.562]  We'll talk about it when we get back.
[01:04:46.582 --> 01:04:47.564]  This is very important.
[01:04:48.284 --> 01:04:48.685]  Stay with us.
[01:04:51.457 --> 01:04:53.058]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:53.418 --> 01:04:59.160]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:04.542]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:05:04.882 --> 01:05:14.166]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:05:14.526 --> 01:05:19.469]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:05:19.809 --> 01:05:23.812]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:05:24.012 --> 01:05:28.795]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:05:29.155 --> 01:05:35.039]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:05:35.399 --> 01:05:41.604]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:05:42.665 --> 01:05:43.906]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:51.232 --> 01:05:55.575]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:55.775 --> 01:06:00.197]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:00.337 --> 01:06:04.720]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.101]  The New World Order.
[01:06:07.032 --> 01:06:08.675]  You will lose your liberty
[01:06:22.472 --> 01:06:32.018]  The new prison economy, the total information society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:32.239 --> 01:06:37.602]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:07:47.145 --> 01:07:49.607]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[01:07:51.108 --> 01:07:58.833]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:58.853 --> 01:08:07.640]  I don't have the words, I don't have the ways to describe how serious it is
[01:08:10.951 --> 01:08:21.301]  That if police pull you over at a checkpoint and find a pocket constitution in your vehicle, that they will rouse you from the car, claim that you assaulted them, and take you to jail.
[01:08:21.681 --> 01:08:25.144]  And we have this stuff on video from squad cars happening.
[01:08:25.965 --> 01:08:29.428]  But it's the FBI, the FEMA, the ADL training.
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:41.867]  And that's why I'm so angry with the ADL and the Southern Poverty Law Center and others, because they're setting up what could only be described as a Nazi or Soviet-style system.
[01:08:42.948 --> 01:08:53.214]  And our caller, Bill in Ohio, was bringing up this point of what Alexander Solzhenitsyn said in Gulag Archipelago, and I have that quote, by the way, at the top of the page.
[01:08:53.254 --> 01:08:54.015]  That's our motto.
[01:08:55.632 --> 01:09:07.221]  Or Maxim, you could say, that quote from Gulag Archipelago where Solzhenitsyn said, what would have happened when the secret police came to pick us up at night if just a small percentage of us would have fought back?
[01:09:08.462 --> 01:09:09.483]  And we are fighting back.
[01:09:09.523 --> 01:09:10.884]  The pen is mightier than the sword.
[01:09:11.245 --> 01:09:12.646]  A lot of police are good.
[01:09:12.666 --> 01:09:15.988]  A lot of military are good and are waking up to what's happening.
[01:09:16.929 --> 01:09:18.150]  But not enough of them.
[01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:20.092]  And it's up to us to educate them.
[01:09:20.232 --> 01:09:22.554]  But then a listener in Kentucky said,
[01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:48.808]  Kelly Rushing goes and gives a state police officer one of my videos, a video of C-SPAN footage as well, and the cop later pulls him over and says, you threatened my family, and takes him to jail, and the judge says to him, you're guilty of giving a police officer an anti-government, anti-police video, where it's not anti-government, anti-police, it's anti-corruption, as he said.
[01:09:50.123 --> 01:09:51.124]  And they'll railroad them.
[01:09:51.384 --> 01:09:58.871]  They won't let the evidence come up before the jury unless things are, I guess, navigated correctly.
[01:09:59.572 --> 01:10:03.595]  But again, the average person just doesn't know how crazy it is.
[01:10:04.796 --> 01:10:06.478]  In public schools all over the nation...
[01:10:07.637 --> 01:10:16.765]  If your child writes the word gun in an essay for English class, they're arrested, they're expelled, the CPS is sent to the home.
[01:10:17.025 --> 01:10:20.008]  Well, your child, in a story, wrote about a gun.
[01:10:20.528 --> 01:10:21.629]  It's thought crime.
[01:10:23.771 --> 01:10:25.753]  A few years ago, there was a case in Idaho.
[01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:41.349]  Where a black football coach assaulted a white woman who was a reporter because she took his picture at the end of the game and the woman's husband jumped over the bleachers and ran up to the black man and the black man called him a racial name.
[01:10:41.869 --> 01:10:49.914]  This was in the newspaper and we had him on the show and the white man called him a racial name back and he was arrested.
[01:10:50.703 --> 01:10:56.847]  For the racial term, and the black man wasn't arrested for assaulting the woman.
[01:10:57.707 --> 01:11:05.131]  And my point is, is that this is thought crime in America, and they're really trying to set this up.
[01:11:05.271 --> 01:11:06.252]  They're doing this.
[01:11:07.533 --> 01:11:18.299]  And right now, it's the minority of police that are doing this, those that have bought the Southern Poverty Law Center, FBI, FEMA, ADL training, because it's all basically identical.
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:20.361]  And I've got their handbooks.
[01:11:20.401 --> 01:11:21.541]  I've got their training videos.
[01:11:21.581 --> 01:11:22.702]  I've had the police on the air.
[01:11:22.742 --> 01:11:23.722]  I've got their manuals.
[01:11:23.903 --> 01:11:25.663]  I mean, I've got video of them teaching it.
[01:11:26.284 --> 01:11:33.207]  I don't want to go back over this again today, but it really is a central issue of how un-American things are getting.
[01:11:33.808 --> 01:11:34.708]  Anything else, Bill?
[01:11:36.869 --> 01:11:37.830]  You wanted to add, sir?
[01:11:38.170 --> 01:11:38.350]  Yeah.
[01:11:38.370 --> 01:11:44.373]  I just wanted to finish up by saying that, like I said, they're doing it because they're getting away with it until...
[01:11:45.319 --> 01:11:47.760]  Some of them go back in body bags every time.
[01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:48.920]  They ain't going to back off.
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:51.381]  That's what I wanted to say.
[01:11:51.981 --> 01:11:53.181]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[01:11:53.501 --> 01:11:57.743]  I think at this point, the globalists don't care if 100,000 cops die.
[01:11:59.023 --> 01:12:06.105]  They don't care if thousands of military die in domestic takeover operations that they've been training for for decades.
[01:12:07.074 --> 01:12:07.814]  They don't care.
[01:12:07.914 --> 01:12:09.235]  I mean, look at the troops in Iraq.
[01:12:09.255 --> 01:12:15.156]  They've been given the deadly vaccines, breathing depleted uranium at 1,900 times safe levels.
[01:12:15.556 --> 01:12:17.217]  They don't care about the police and military.
[01:12:17.257 --> 01:12:18.897]  They don't care if we get in a war with them.
[01:12:19.357 --> 01:12:21.278]  In fact, they want that to escalate things.
[01:12:22.078 --> 01:12:34.001]  The answer is, when they try stuff like this in a town or city, to remove the local government through the election, to sue public officials to stand up against it,
[01:12:35.195 --> 01:12:42.357]  In this town in Kentucky, in Fredonia, Kentucky, everybody needs to get my videos.
[01:12:42.397 --> 01:12:43.658]  A hundred people need to get them.
[01:12:44.278 --> 01:12:50.400]  Make a hundred copies apiece and put out 10,000 copies where every person in the city has a copy.
[01:12:51.811 --> 01:12:58.437]  And put a note with each copy saying, a citizen was arrested for giving a police officer one of these in America.
[01:12:58.858 --> 01:13:02.622]  And in America, we're supposed to be able to have free speech, the First Amendment.
[01:13:02.962 --> 01:13:11.110]  And if you did that, if 10,000 copies of my film, and by the way, I know of individuals who've given out 4,000 copies, by the way.
[01:13:13.232 --> 01:13:14.954]  But if 100 people got together,
[01:13:16.026 --> 01:13:25.832]  And made a couple hundred copies apiece, and then told those that got copies of the films to make copies themselves, you'd have more than 10,000 copies in this county, in this town.
[01:13:27.152 --> 01:13:30.394]  And it's only a town of a few thousand people, by the way, so you wouldn't even have to do that.
[01:13:31.255 --> 01:13:34.457]  And then people say, yeah, what's wrong with our police department?
[01:13:34.777 --> 01:13:36.798]  What's wrong with the state police in our area?
[01:13:37.038 --> 01:13:38.739]  This isn't Russia, this is America.
[01:13:40.109 --> 01:13:45.674]  But again, if you had real local talk radio in that town, they wouldn't be able to get away with this.
[01:13:46.415 --> 01:13:57.606]  But instead you've got these neocon whores that tell you conservatism is gun control and open borders and Michael Savage saying put anybody who disagrees with the government in a concentration camp.
[01:13:57.826 --> 01:14:00.209]  And by the way, he says that every time he's on the air.
[01:14:00.989 --> 01:14:03.532]  I mean, it sounds unbelievable, but that's the case.
[01:14:04.099 --> 01:14:04.499]  We're good to go.
[01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:29.241]  A radical show.
[01:14:29.281 --> 01:14:32.103]  Have you heard what Michael Savage is saying on the other station?
[01:14:32.463 --> 01:14:35.945]  Put anybody who disagrees with the government in a forced labor camp?
[01:14:35.985 --> 01:14:36.966]  That's his actual quote.
[01:14:37.547 --> 01:14:38.687]  I mean, that's radical.
[01:14:38.807 --> 01:14:45.952]  All we're saying is, hey folks, we've got national talk show hosts and the media and the Pentagon talking about putting us in camps.
[01:14:46.193 --> 01:14:47.013]  This ain't good.
[01:14:47.033 --> 01:14:51.977]  That's all we're pointing out here is the emperor has no clothes.
[01:14:53.037 --> 01:14:54.318]  We're not radical at all.
[01:14:54.698 --> 01:14:56.660]  We get up here on air and we cover the news.
[01:14:58.291 --> 01:15:01.413]  I just can't believe how far we've slipped, how fast things have moved.
[01:15:02.294 --> 01:15:06.397]  Let's go ahead and talk to Marlene in Florida.
[01:15:06.417 --> 01:15:07.437]  Marlene, go ahead.
[01:15:08.318 --> 01:15:09.018]  Hello, Alex.
[01:15:09.038 --> 01:15:09.919]  How are you doing today?
[01:15:10.079 --> 01:15:10.379]  Good.
[01:15:10.559 --> 01:15:13.201]  By the way, talk to Joyce Riley about that sore throat of yours.
[01:15:13.361 --> 01:15:16.143]  She had one, and within two days, she was fine.
[01:15:16.163 --> 01:15:19.305]  Well, I rarely get sick, but I have had some sore throats this year.
[01:15:19.566 --> 01:15:20.847]  I don't know what's causing it.
[01:15:22.508 --> 01:15:25.670]  What I want to tell you, I was so proud of Mel last night.
[01:15:26.571 --> 01:15:33.417]  For the stance he takes and lives, he's thoroughly, truly a believing Christian.
[01:15:33.957 --> 01:15:36.279]  And he's been blessed.
[01:15:36.379 --> 01:15:37.700]  Absolutely.
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:44.605]  Every film he makes is a giant success now, and they're wholesome compared to the rest of the stuff we see coming out of Hollywood.
[01:15:44.886 --> 01:15:49.189]  That proves that people want wholesome, uplifting films.
[01:15:49.289 --> 01:15:51.771]  They don't want the garbage being crammed down our throat.
[01:15:52.071 --> 01:15:52.672]  Absolutely.
[01:15:53.896 --> 01:15:58.100]  Diane tried to put a wedge in there, and boy, Mel stood up to her.
[01:15:59.101 --> 01:16:18.518]  When she mentioned something about Hutton saying, they were talking about Jews encamped in the Holocaust during the Second World War, and like 6,000 Jews, and Hutton seems to think, I'm not sure, I just gathered from what was said last night, that there were less than 6,000 Jews, and
[01:16:19.915 --> 01:16:20.395]  We're good to go.
[01:16:20.415 --> 01:16:21.075]  We're good to go.
[01:16:46.579 --> 01:16:49.881]  And she tried to put that wedge in there, and he just stood up to her.
[01:16:50.241 --> 01:16:51.942]  And I thought, wow, go, man, go.
[01:16:52.322 --> 01:16:53.723]  Well, I'm really frustrated now.
[01:16:53.783 --> 01:16:55.523]  I guess I only got about half the show.
[01:16:55.583 --> 01:16:56.264]  How long was it?
[01:16:57.124 --> 01:16:59.685]  It was an hour show, minus the commercials, of course.
[01:17:00.626 --> 01:17:02.287]  Okay, so... So it was the full hour.
[01:17:02.327 --> 01:17:03.347]  She had him for the full hour.
[01:17:03.367 --> 01:17:08.670]  Well, a listener called, and the listener said that if I'll just stop asking for a copy of it, he'll send me one, and that's good.
[01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:13.332]  But, you know, if I'll just stop asking for a copy of it... Yeah.
[01:17:13.392 --> 01:17:14.693]  Well, you know, this is what happens...
[01:17:17.169 --> 01:17:18.509]  And I've talked to Hutton about this.
[01:17:18.749 --> 01:17:21.850]  What they do is they put out false quotes.
[01:17:22.090 --> 01:17:23.670]  They lie, okay?
[01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:24.950]  That's what's happened.
[01:17:25.651 --> 01:17:34.212]  I mean, look, they had... The part I did see was Foxman on there saying that he didn't say the film was anti-Semitic.
[01:17:34.692 --> 01:17:35.732]  Well, that's a lie.
[01:17:35.892 --> 01:17:38.273]  I have his press release where he said that.
[01:17:38.813 --> 01:17:40.313]  It was less than a month ago.
[01:17:40.353 --> 01:17:44.234]  He said that I'm in the Orlando area, outside the Orlando area, and...
[01:17:44.908 --> 01:17:47.530]  He was quoted as saying that in the Orlando Sentinel.
[01:17:48.791 --> 01:17:53.675]  Well, I mean, and look, the Orlando Sentinel could misquote Foxman because the media is well known for that.
[01:17:53.995 --> 01:17:57.037]  My point is, Foxman put an article out a few months ago.
[01:17:57.157 --> 01:18:05.884]  I read it on air, and he said there is no doubt Mel Gibson's an anti-Semite, there's no doubt this movie's bad, and this movie needs to be boycotted.
[01:18:07.034 --> 01:18:08.575]  And so he is a liar.
[01:18:09.135 --> 01:18:16.257]  He is a liar, so the point is you can't believe any... And all I saw was every time they cut to Diane Sawyer, she was glaring at Mel.
[01:18:16.277 --> 01:18:17.877]  She had an ugly look on her face.
[01:18:18.638 --> 01:18:21.538]  And she was trying to put him off ease.
[01:18:22.319 --> 01:18:23.419]  She was trying to make him nervous.
[01:18:23.499 --> 01:18:24.679]  And she didn't do it.
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:26.260]  She didn't do it.
[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:27.340]  She couldn't sway him.
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:33.062]  His defense was because he lives what he lives and believes what he lives.
[01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:33.900]  I hear you.
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:34.980]  Thanks for the call.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:35.801]  I really appreciate the call.
[01:18:35.861 --> 01:18:42.502]  And we've got a lot of other callers that want to talk about this primetime piece that aired last night.
[01:18:42.822 --> 01:18:44.583]  Basically, what you said is so right.
[01:18:44.603 --> 01:18:45.343]  The media...
[01:19:02.285 --> 01:19:09.152]  Is trying to drive a wedge into the public psyche so people don't see this film or so they don't get the message of the film.
[01:19:10.413 --> 01:19:12.255]  The media is anti-Christian.
[01:19:12.275 --> 01:19:14.257]  I mean, that's obvious.
[01:19:14.497 --> 01:19:16.139]  Just watch a TV show.
[01:19:16.159 --> 01:19:18.901]  That message is everywhere.
[01:19:20.423 --> 01:19:23.406]  And so, they try to raise this anti-Semitism...
[01:19:25.052 --> 01:19:27.813]  Red herring, because that's a horrible allegation.
[01:19:28.953 --> 01:19:32.354]  But we'll come back and continue with your calls.
[01:19:32.394 --> 01:19:33.434]  Wide open phones today.
[01:19:33.454 --> 01:19:34.895]  Got Greg Palace coming up the next hour.
[01:19:35.595 --> 01:19:38.636]  We'll talk to Dominique and Don and Victor and many others that are holding.
[01:19:39.956 --> 01:19:43.837]  I'll take about five more calls, and I'm going to get into some news, kind of a news blitz here.
[01:19:44.618 --> 01:19:47.859]  And then we'll go to our guest, Greg Palace.
[01:19:47.899 --> 01:19:48.299]  Stay with us.
[01:19:48.319 --> 01:19:48.879]  We'll be right back.

[01:21:14.485 --> 01:21:24.206]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:21:24.326 --> 01:21:33.208]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:21:33.468 --> 01:21:36.769]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:21:50.336 --> 01:21:56.541]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:21:57.001 --> 01:22:04.767]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:05.128 --> 01:22:12.974]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:22:13.274 --> 01:22:15.215]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[01:22:49.410 --> 01:22:52.233]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[01:22:52.353 --> 01:22:53.194]  Michael Trudeau here.
[01:22:53.314 --> 01:22:56.617]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[01:22:56.817 --> 01:22:59.960]  You see, a little over 20 years ago I was involved in a car accident.
[01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:02.441]  That injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[01:23:02.581 --> 01:23:05.663]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[01:23:05.883 --> 01:23:10.146]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[01:23:10.346 --> 01:23:12.247]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[01:23:12.367 --> 01:23:19.451]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[01:23:19.631 --> 01:23:22.093]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[01:23:22.393 --> 01:23:25.076]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice.
[01:23:25.216 --> 01:23:26.717]  Only this time it changed my life.
[01:23:26.997 --> 01:23:28.759]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement.
[01:23:28.839 --> 01:23:30.941]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[01:23:31.021 --> 01:23:33.583]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[01:23:33.623 --> 01:23:36.346]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[01:23:36.526 --> 01:23:37.046]  Side effects?
[01:23:37.227 --> 01:23:39.489]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[01:23:39.649 --> 01:23:41.150]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[01:23:41.170 --> 01:23:41.370]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[01:23:41.490 --> 01:23:42.772]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[01:23:42.812 --> 01:23:43.432]  It worked for me.
[01:23:52.192 --> 01:23:57.314]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:58.015 --> 01:24:00.396]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:24:03.598 --> 01:24:16.765]  Well, predominantly on the show today, we've been talking about the First Amendment and how it's under attack here in the United States, and how freedom of speech worldwide is under attack, and listeners have been calling in one after another
[01:24:17.663 --> 01:24:31.906]  Saying how great they thought the Crime Time piece was last night with Mel Gibson, with the CFR member Diane Sawyer, and how Mel did a pretty good job of fending off her attempts at demonization.
[01:24:33.986 --> 01:24:38.447]  Let's go back to the calls, and then I'll get into this huge stack of really important news.
[01:24:38.507 --> 01:24:41.128]  In fact, one of the articles here, New Level...
[01:24:41.977 --> 01:24:45.259]  And new link between lead levels and schizophrenia.
[01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:46.580]  This is out of the London Independent.
[01:24:47.001 --> 01:24:55.147]  Babies exposed to high levels of lead in the womb are more than twice as likely to develop schizophrenia in adulthood, according to new research by U.S.
[01:24:55.187 --> 01:24:55.687]  scientists.
[01:24:56.047 --> 01:25:06.595]  Blood samples taken from pregnant American women in the 1960s show that the children of those who had high levels of lead in their blood grew up with a much increased risk of psychiatric disorders.
[01:25:07.663 --> 01:25:09.064]  And I've got another study here.
[01:25:09.144 --> 01:25:11.605]  Guess what mercury can do?
[01:25:11.665 --> 01:25:15.287]  It can cause schizophrenia later and, of course, brain damage in children.
[01:25:15.588 --> 01:25:17.769]  And that's exactly what's in the vaccines.
[01:25:17.829 --> 01:25:31.016]  And I have another article from yesterday out of the Associated Press where the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, tried to cover up their own records showing that the mercury in the vaccines was brain damage in children.
[01:25:31.797 --> 01:25:34.018]  But no matter how they try to cover this up,
[01:25:35.012 --> 01:25:36.693]  More and more of it is starting to come out.
[01:25:37.214 --> 01:25:39.315]  So we'll get into that more after the next break.
[01:25:39.495 --> 01:25:40.796]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:25:41.296 --> 01:25:43.078]  Dominique in Texas, go ahead.
[01:25:43.098 --> 01:25:43.798]  You're on the air.
[01:25:44.118 --> 01:25:45.359]  Yes, sir, Mr. Alex Jones.
[01:25:45.379 --> 01:25:46.000]  How are you doing?
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:46.560]  Pretty good.
[01:25:46.580 --> 01:25:47.541]  That's good.
[01:25:48.141 --> 01:25:56.407]  The first thing, I want to thank you for all the hard work you do in informing us and the very powerful videos that you've made to help us spread the word.
[01:25:58.113 --> 01:26:01.295]  The question I have is in reference to the Patriot Act resolution.
[01:26:01.315 --> 01:26:03.636]  You know, I met you out there at the LCRA building.
[01:26:03.996 --> 01:26:07.378]  Oh, you came down a few months ago when we threw the Patriot Act out in Austin.
[01:26:07.578 --> 01:26:08.238]  Hey, yes, sir.
[01:26:08.278 --> 01:26:09.699]  I spoke to you briefly over there.
[01:26:10.399 --> 01:26:18.463]  The question about that that I had is, well, you know, we got the resolution passed, but it seems that the Patriot Act is still being used, you know, freely.
[01:26:20.225 --> 01:26:32.594]  But what it does is it puts it in the public record that it is improper, that it's criminal what they're doing, and it causes the government to hesitate and to not legitimize the use of it.
[01:26:33.835 --> 01:26:38.538]  So it is a good thing what we did here in Austin, what you did, what you were part of, but I agree.
[01:26:38.578 --> 01:26:40.680]  I mean, we have not won this fight far from it.
[01:26:42.221 --> 01:26:44.883]  Okay, yeah, because I was just wondering, you know, what else can we do?
[01:26:44.923 --> 01:26:45.443]  What's the next?
[01:26:45.503 --> 01:26:49.126]  I know you always say inform people, but what else, you know, as far as
[01:26:49.813 --> 01:26:50.974]  Well, really, that's what we did.
[01:26:50.994 --> 01:26:59.438]  I mean, by going down and having hundreds of people show up and by having all that testimony and by exposing what's in the Patriot Act and by confronting U.S.
[01:26:59.498 --> 01:27:03.740]  attorneys, we let them know that we know we're not giving up on America.
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.100]  We're not going to capitulate.
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:07.802]  We're not going to abandon the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:27:08.322 --> 01:27:11.003]  So that's why, I mean, it's a war.
[01:27:11.083 --> 01:27:12.744]  It's putting one foot in front of the next.
[01:27:13.483 --> 01:27:21.189]  You know, exposing what the Patriot Act really does is damaging their capacity to use it against the general population.
[01:27:21.629 --> 01:27:23.711]  All right, yeah, you answered my question.
[01:27:23.751 --> 01:27:24.091]  Thanks a lot.
[01:27:24.111 --> 01:27:24.772]  You have a good one.
[01:27:25.052 --> 01:27:25.612]  Hey, thank you.
[01:27:25.672 --> 01:27:26.553]  I appreciate the call.
[01:27:26.573 --> 01:27:27.274]  Good to hear from you.
[01:27:27.914 --> 01:27:29.796]  Let's talk to Don in Tennessee.
[01:27:29.896 --> 01:27:30.736]  Don, go ahead.
[01:27:30.896 --> 01:27:32.177]  Yeah, how you doing today, Alex?
[01:27:32.297 --> 01:27:32.698]  Pretty good.
[01:27:33.178 --> 01:27:33.378]  Good.
[01:27:33.458 --> 01:27:38.062]  I've got this recorded, and I've got the video keyed up now if you'd like to hear it on air.
[01:27:39.415 --> 01:27:40.395]  You know, that's funny.
[01:27:40.715 --> 01:27:44.757]  The next caller, Victor, says he has it queued up as well.
[01:27:45.057 --> 01:27:48.978]  Yeah, I have it, and I want to send you a copy of it so you have it.
[01:27:49.058 --> 01:27:54.299]  Well, again, I ended up taping part of the primetime piece last night, but yes, I would appreciate that.
[01:27:55.039 --> 01:27:57.240]  I tell you what, put the phone right up to the speaker and let's hear it.
[01:27:57.900 --> 01:27:58.760]  What clip is this?
[01:27:59.681 --> 01:28:01.201]  This is Diane Sawyer.
[01:28:01.241 --> 01:28:08.503]  When she asked him, she was asking him about his series of movies on the Lethal Weapons series,
[01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:18.824]  Leading up to where he makes his statement that he is going to pitch a tent and camp out where he can't be found by weapons of mass destruction.
[01:28:19.684 --> 01:28:20.765]  Go ahead and play the clip then.
[01:28:20.865 --> 01:28:22.305]  Okay, let me get the phone there.
[01:28:23.106 --> 01:28:24.746]  And again, I'm surprised.
[01:28:25.567 --> 01:28:32.129]  I know Hutton is surprised by the fact that they did leave that in there.
[01:28:32.469 --> 01:28:33.690]  Yeah, I was surprised.
[01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:36.051]  I was stunned, but pleasantly stunned.
[01:28:36.171 --> 01:28:36.831]  Here it is right here.
[01:28:36.851 --> 01:28:38.512]  I feel like I want to get in front of the camera now.
[01:28:42.384 --> 01:28:43.785]  Yeah, that's way too low, Don.
[01:28:44.925 --> 01:28:46.926]  You know, I can actually get these... I might not hurry back.
[01:28:47.767 --> 01:28:51.369]  I might go and go somewhere no one can find me.
[01:28:51.389 --> 01:28:51.929]  You know where that is?
[01:28:52.089 --> 01:28:54.090]  You know where's the place that no one can find you?
[01:28:55.811 --> 01:29:00.233]  I was thinking of pitching my tent right next to the weapons of mass destruction.
[01:29:00.859 --> 01:29:04.940]  And no one would find me.
[01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:05.860]  Did you get that?
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:07.240]  Yeah, I did get to that.
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:07.681]  Thanks.
[01:29:07.961 --> 01:29:10.141]  Okay, well, that's what I wanted to do.
[01:29:10.201 --> 01:29:11.281]  And I have your address.
[01:29:11.361 --> 01:29:13.242]  I'll send you a copy of this, okay?
[01:29:13.462 --> 01:29:15.282]  Well, I appreciate it, Don.
[01:29:16.782 --> 01:29:17.603]  Anything else, Don?
[01:29:18.023 --> 01:29:18.943]  No, that's about it.
[01:29:18.963 --> 01:29:22.044]  I just appreciate what you're doing for us and keeping us informed.
[01:29:22.484 --> 01:29:23.484]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:29:25.044 --> 01:29:25.624]  All right.
[01:29:26.245 --> 01:29:27.165]  Well, that was interesting.
[01:29:28.832 --> 01:29:29.573]  Yeah, that's funny.
[01:29:29.593 --> 01:29:30.894]  That's a great line.
[01:29:31.875 --> 01:29:38.662]  We'll come back, and we'll talk to Victor and Ron and Ed and others, and then we'll get into more news.
[01:29:38.682 --> 01:29:39.223]  Stay with us.
[01:29:41.825 --> 01:29:42.706]  We're on the march.
[01:29:43.206 --> 01:29:44.808]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:44.828 --> 01:29:48.432]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:52.682 --> 01:29:54.903]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:29:55.323 --> 01:29:59.684]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:29:59.964 --> 01:30:05.765]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:30:06.005 --> 01:30:10.046]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:30:10.346 --> 01:30:15.988]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[01:30:16.088 --> 01:30:18.709]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:30:20.809 --> 01:30:24.711]  By mid-1983 it was close to $500 an ounce.
[01:30:24.751 --> 01:30:27.131]  In 1986 gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[01:30:27.472 --> 01:30:29.772]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[01:30:30.153 --> 01:30:33.774]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[01:30:34.254 --> 01:30:40.457]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[01:30:40.897 --> 01:30:41.877]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:30:41.897 --> 01:30:42.557]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:30:42.577 --> 01:30:42.757]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:30:52.225 --> 01:30:54.827]  Brr, record cold spells gripping the nation this winter.
[01:30:54.947 --> 01:30:56.047]  So much for global warming.
[01:30:56.247 --> 01:31:00.430]  Of course, hand in hand with record cold spells usually go record fuel bills for heating.
[01:31:00.450 --> 01:31:03.412]  But for thousands of people across the country, there's no record fuel bill.
[01:31:03.572 --> 01:31:04.832]  In fact, there's no bill at all.
[01:31:04.992 --> 01:31:11.496]  These people have discovered the magic of a warm workshop without the cost by burning waste oil with a waste oil heater kit from Harold Electric.
[01:31:11.696 --> 01:31:14.318]  We all enjoy having a comfortable shop in the winter months to work in.
[01:31:14.518 --> 01:31:21.282]  And a waste oil heater from Harold Electric can turn your waste oil from a liability into an incredibly efficient and economical way to heat your workshop.
[01:31:21.462 --> 01:31:21.922]  We're good to go.
[01:31:21.942 --> 01:31:22.322]  We're good to go.
[01:31:22.342 --> 01:31:23.182]  We're good to go.
[01:31:52.125 --> 01:31:54.186]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[01:31:54.347 --> 01:31:55.988]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot.
[01:31:56.128 --> 01:32:04.113]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[01:32:04.353 --> 01:32:10.797]  Imagine hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini, followed by peaches, mixed fruit, or pineapple for dessert.
[01:32:10.977 --> 01:32:12.218]  Just a few of the many selections.
[01:32:13.559 --> 01:32:18.563]  The Long Life Food Depot was recently mentioned in a USA Today article on the very subject of emergency preparations.
[01:32:18.583 --> 01:32:20.885]  It makes sense to be prepared, and Long Life Food Depot makes it easy.
[01:32:28.451 --> 01:32:32.474]  Long-term storable MREs make for convenience when camping, hiking, or canoeing.
[01:32:32.694 --> 01:32:34.715]  No fires allowed, hot meals still are.
[01:32:34.835 --> 01:32:40.038]  Call the Long Life Food Depot toll-free at 800-601-2833.
[01:32:40.159 --> 01:32:44.061]  That's 1-800-601-2833 or visit longlifefood.com.
[01:32:44.301 --> 01:32:47.643]  The Long Life Food Depot offers free shipping via UPS ground on every order.
[01:32:47.743 --> 01:32:48.184]  Don't wait.
[01:32:48.304 --> 01:32:49.965]  Call the Long Life Food Depot today.
[01:32:57.982 --> 01:33:01.005]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[01:33:01.586 --> 01:33:04.208]  A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[01:33:04.609 --> 01:33:07.552]  I'm the guy who's a boss on this highway.
[01:33:07.752 --> 01:33:08.793]  So watch out what you do.
[01:33:08.893 --> 01:33:12.136]  All right, my friends, we're back live.
[01:33:12.356 --> 01:33:17.982]  And the whole show basically has turned into a discussion of primetime last night with Diane Sawyer.
[01:33:18.602 --> 01:33:22.266]  And they attempted the failed demonization of the passion.
[01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:27.702]  And we're going to take a few more calls, and then I'm going to get into some other news issues.
[01:33:27.722 --> 01:33:34.526]  And we've got Greg Palast, award-winning BBC reporter, joining us coming up in the next hour.
[01:33:34.546 --> 01:33:36.787]  I was just talking to Hutton during the break.
[01:33:37.308 --> 01:33:42.831]  He thought it was a pretty good piece, and so did I. But what else can they do?
[01:33:43.691 --> 01:33:45.272]  I mean, it's a good movie.
[01:33:45.352 --> 01:33:46.613]  It's a wholesome film.
[01:33:47.233 --> 01:33:50.415]  Why, then, has the media been demonizing The Passion of Christ?
[01:33:51.369 --> 01:34:01.874]  And this is just a microcosm example of how, across the board, anything that's wholesome and good is being attacked, while things that are evil are being held up as good.
[01:34:02.934 --> 01:34:05.055]  But, I mean, basically, that's all I can say on the subject.
[01:34:05.695 --> 01:34:11.478]  Let's go ahead and talk now to... Oh, I guess who's up next here?
[01:34:11.958 --> 01:34:13.859]  Victor in Florida.
[01:34:13.879 --> 01:34:14.259]  Go ahead.
[01:34:14.279 --> 01:34:14.939]  You're on the air.
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:15.940]  Hello.
[01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:18.141]  I'm calling from Pensacola, and...
[01:34:18.852 --> 01:34:24.337]  I wanted to comment on the so-called pastor from Presbyterian Church USA in Dallas.
[01:34:25.018 --> 01:34:28.642]  Yeah, and for those, again, that just joined us, recap what happened yesterday.
[01:34:29.342 --> 01:34:42.255]  Well, basically, he is a gun grabber who's using his church to indoctrinate people into believing that you shouldn't have a gun, and he's couching it nicely.
[01:34:43.084 --> 01:34:49.087]  And they've had seven gun buybacks, and a listener sent me an email yesterday that's a good point.
[01:34:49.647 --> 01:34:52.569]  The Presbyterian Church is anti-gun.
[01:34:52.609 --> 01:34:54.310]  They're also pro-open border.
[01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:55.510]  They're lobbying for that.
[01:34:56.290 --> 01:34:59.992]  In Arizona, they're one of the churches helping put the water stations up for the illegals.
[01:35:00.693 --> 01:35:04.795]  And on top of it, they're the church that's promoting all these marriages.
[01:35:05.195 --> 01:35:07.456]  Well, when you're saying the Presbyterian Church...
[01:35:07.901 --> 01:35:14.026]  He is representing the Presbyterian Church USA, which is the largest denomination.
[01:35:14.246 --> 01:35:21.332]  Oh, yes, when I say the Presbyterian Church, I mean the big international one that's been getting all the heat for their stances.
[01:35:21.692 --> 01:35:28.838]  Right, and they're the largest denomination in the USA, and I know about it because I was baptized in it, raised in it.
[01:35:29.619 --> 01:35:34.303]  Our church that I grew up in voted to leave that denomination
[01:35:35.637 --> 01:35:44.544]  Well, I appreciate you making that point because we're talking about the Presbyterian Church USA.
[01:35:44.584 --> 01:35:45.004]  You're right.
[01:35:45.885 --> 01:35:53.171]  And the thing about it is that is the only Presbyterian denomination in the United States that belongs to the World Council of Churches.
[01:35:54.145 --> 01:35:57.670]  And for those that don't know about that, why don't you tell them about World Council of Churches?
[01:35:58.090 --> 01:36:05.159]  Well, it was originally, they were going to form it in 1937, but their organization got interrupted by the Second World War.
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:07.602]  They finally did organize in 1948.
[01:36:09.662 --> 01:36:12.643]  And they're basically an internationalist organization.
[01:36:12.923 --> 01:36:15.505]  If you go to their website, you just go to searching.
[01:36:15.565 --> 01:36:19.866]  Yeah, the Rockefellers helped set it up, and it's to set up a one-world government church.
[01:36:19.946 --> 01:36:21.547]  I mean, that's their own founding document.
[01:36:21.747 --> 01:36:28.730]  Right, and ostensibly it's ecumenical to get all Christians of different denominations to get together and agree on things.
[01:36:29.130 --> 01:36:34.933]  But what it really is is a front to destroy orthodox or traditional denominations
[01:36:35.885 --> 01:36:37.165]  Biblical Christianity.
[01:36:37.185 --> 01:36:37.765]  Well, that's it.
[01:36:37.785 --> 01:36:39.326]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[01:36:39.366 --> 01:36:39.826]  Good points.
[01:36:39.866 --> 01:36:40.606]  Anything else, Victor?
[01:36:40.946 --> 01:36:56.170]  Yeah, I just wanted to say that that pastor, even in the Presbyterian Church USA, although it's corrupt from the top down, they are required, all Presbyterian pastors in that denomination are required to study Hebrew and Greek.
[01:36:57.210 --> 01:37:03.512]  And so when he told you that he had not heard of that scripture of Luke 22-36, he was a
[01:37:05.239 --> 01:37:09.322]  He was lying because they have to be smart.
[01:37:09.802 --> 01:37:11.884]  They have to be at least intellectually smart.
[01:37:11.904 --> 01:37:13.305]  They don't necessarily have wisdom.
[01:37:13.505 --> 01:37:27.135]  Well, I don't want to say that we know he's a liar, but it's hard to believe that one of the most famous or well-known sections of the Bible is the Garden of Gethsemane and what happened there.
[01:37:27.626 --> 01:37:27.846]  Right.
[01:37:28.146 --> 01:37:29.407]  And, of course, the Gospel of Luke.
[01:37:29.427 --> 01:37:33.229]  So to claim that, you know, I say, well, you know, the Bible says we should sell our cloaks and buy swords.
[01:37:33.589 --> 01:37:34.670]  He says, oh, I've never heard of that.
[01:37:34.710 --> 01:37:35.490]  That's not true.
[01:37:35.770 --> 01:37:40.213]  Well, if he hadn't heard of that, he is unfit to be a pastor in any denomination.
[01:37:40.253 --> 01:37:45.715]  Well, I just want to point out that the big Presbyterian church, again, they're for the open borders, gun control, all of it.
[01:37:46.216 --> 01:37:46.476]  Right.
[01:37:46.596 --> 01:37:52.279]  And, like I said, our church I grew up in became aware of that early on.
[01:37:52.299 --> 01:37:52.519]  Right.
[01:37:53.846 --> 01:37:59.809]  I also wanted to comment that I enjoyed the interview with Hutton Gibson yesterday.
[01:37:59.829 --> 01:38:00.250]  I know.
[01:38:00.290 --> 01:38:05.152]  Every time I have Hutton on, people beg me to get him back on the show, and we really appreciate the time he spent with us.
[01:38:05.333 --> 01:38:12.657]  I was only disappointed on one point, and that was where, toward the end, he was saying that he didn't read that much from the Old Testament.
[01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:25.245]  In 2 Timothy 3.16, it says, All Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.
[01:38:26.025 --> 01:38:29.046]  I think that other than that, he's on the right track.
[01:38:29.427 --> 01:38:29.767]  All right.
[01:38:29.787 --> 01:38:31.167]  Well, listen, I appreciate the call.
[01:38:32.308 --> 01:38:36.049]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Ed in Pennsylvania.
[01:38:36.130 --> 01:38:36.750]  Ed, go ahead.
[01:38:36.990 --> 01:38:37.430]  Hey, Alex.
[01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:38.310]  Hello.
[01:38:38.531 --> 01:38:39.551]  This is a little different subject.
[01:38:40.031 --> 01:38:40.712]  Hey, that's fine.
[01:38:41.052 --> 01:38:43.973]  I was reading the March issue of Soldier of Fortune.
[01:38:44.801 --> 01:38:50.764]  And they took down some heroin labs, special forces, in Afghanistan.
[01:38:51.144 --> 01:39:00.069]  Yeah, by the way, Afghanistan is now the world leader in opium production, but before we, quote, liberated it, the production had fallen off to almost nothing.
[01:39:01.089 --> 01:39:03.570]  These special forces guys went in with a reporter.
[01:39:04.291 --> 01:39:06.432]  They took down the labs, and...
[01:39:07.435 --> 01:39:10.017]  About a week later, from higher up, they were told to cut it out.
[01:39:10.177 --> 01:39:10.497]  Stop.
[01:39:10.917 --> 01:39:11.838]  You're stepping on toes.
[01:39:12.118 --> 01:39:13.559]  And that was in Soldier of Fortune?
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:14.740]  March, yep.
[01:39:15.341 --> 01:39:18.883]  March, which I got last month, but it's a March issue, yeah.
[01:39:20.264 --> 01:39:23.406]  I need to get the writer of that article on.
[01:39:23.446 --> 01:39:24.147]  Who's the writer?
[01:39:25.328 --> 01:39:26.809]  It's at my girlfriend's house right now, Alex.
[01:39:26.869 --> 01:39:28.030]  I'm not sure.
[01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.770]  Okay.
[01:39:28.830 --> 01:39:29.531]  Go buy a copy.
[01:39:30.551 --> 01:39:32.173]  It's at the very end of the article.
[01:39:32.193 --> 01:39:33.754]  It tells you how great everything went.
[01:39:34.334 --> 01:39:36.155]  The very end, it says they were told to stop.
[01:39:36.636 --> 01:39:36.856]  Cease.
[01:39:38.795 --> 01:39:49.660]  Well, it's come out in the Associated Press, the San Francisco Chronicle, and other publications that special forces colonels would have al-Qaeda pinned down, and they'd be ordered to stand down, and then U.S.
[01:39:49.700 --> 01:39:58.463]  military helicopters landed during the war in 2001, 2002, on multiple occasions would land, pick them up, and fly them out of the country.
[01:40:00.044 --> 01:40:07.187]  We were told by a young girl around here, she was about 16, that her and her friends were trying, they were snorting heroin at the age of 13.
[01:40:08.804 --> 01:40:09.984]  This is crazy.
[01:40:11.765 --> 01:40:12.445]  This is tragic.
[01:40:12.485 --> 01:40:13.926]  There's so much of that junk on the streets.
[01:40:14.246 --> 01:40:14.826]  It's so cheap.
[01:40:14.926 --> 01:40:22.569]  Well, they're saying that a massive wave in the last year and a half of Afghan opium has hit Europe and the U.S.
[01:40:23.629 --> 01:40:26.530]  And again, the government is involved in the trade.
[01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:27.610]  They control the trade.
[01:40:27.991 --> 01:40:33.933]  And then they send SWAT teams to bust down our doors in the middle of the night looking for the drugs that they shipped in to begin with.
[01:40:34.193 --> 01:40:34.793]  Thanks for the call.
[01:40:36.293 --> 01:40:38.034]  Two more calls and I'm going into news here.
[01:40:39.135 --> 01:40:42.716]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ron in Kansas City.
[01:40:42.796 --> 01:40:43.476]  Ron, go ahead.
[01:40:43.496 --> 01:40:47.397]  I want to know the difference between an anti-Semite and anti-Zion.
[01:40:47.977 --> 01:40:50.677]  I believe I'm anti-Zion but not anti-Semitic.
[01:40:51.238 --> 01:40:54.758]  I don't believe that God gave that land to the Jews.
[01:40:55.218 --> 01:40:56.659]  They took it through the force of arms.
[01:40:57.419 --> 01:41:08.381]  The first time when they went in and slaughtered everybody, all the animals, babies, women, children, men, and the second time when British colonists pulled out, Britain and us gave them the weapons
[01:41:09.108 --> 01:41:12.051]  And they went in and destroyed a lot of Arabs then.
[01:41:14.473 --> 01:41:28.686]  Well, certainly Jews are from that part of the world, and I don't support some of the corrupt things that Israel's involved in, or arming our enemies, arming Iran, which they're involved in, arming Pakistan, arming North Korea.
[01:41:28.926 --> 01:41:32.149]  But the British do it, our own government does it, and...
[01:41:33.946 --> 01:41:34.627]  We're good to go.
[01:41:54.258 --> 01:42:04.443]  That land, I mean, certainly that's in the Old Testament, and they are from that area, so I don't know how you can say that Jews don't have a place in that area of the world.
[01:42:05.364 --> 01:42:14.188]  Well, they were the Hebrew slaves of Egypt, and then the second time when we gave it to them after World War II, they were just people that integrated into Europe.
[01:42:14.769 --> 01:42:20.992]  They aren't the biblical Jews when the Romans destroyed them around the 70 A.D.
[01:42:22.212 --> 01:42:23.333]  Those are just Europeans.
[01:42:24.215 --> 01:42:33.900]  Well, I tend to agree that when you look at the Zionists actually involved with Hitler early on and some of the things they've done, I wouldn't even call these people Jewish.
[01:42:34.381 --> 01:42:39.603]  And that's what I've been saying is that we shouldn't let any group represent us.
[01:42:39.864 --> 01:42:42.945]  If you're Jewish, you shouldn't let the ADL be your spokesman.
[01:42:43.666 --> 01:42:50.009]  And if you're a gun owner, you shouldn't let the NRA be your spokesman because these are sellout groups working for the New World Order.
[01:42:50.329 --> 01:42:52.411]  But I don't think that Jews run the New World Order.
[01:42:52.451 --> 01:42:55.513]  I think that you've got Jews involved in the New World Order.
[01:42:56.113 --> 01:43:04.379]  But I think that when you say, well, it's a Jewish conspiracy, you fall into a trap that the New World Order wants to foster because you've got Dutch royalty, British royalty.
[01:43:05.019 --> 01:43:09.403]  You've got all these elite families working together to bring in this New World Order.
[01:43:10.303 --> 01:43:12.405]  Well, I'm not saying that I'm against the Jews.
[01:43:12.845 --> 01:43:18.429]  It's nowhere in history or even today has two governments simultaneously
[01:43:18.954 --> 01:43:20.235]  Well, look, let me just say this.
[01:43:20.255 --> 01:43:21.897]  Let me just say this to you.
[01:43:21.917 --> 01:43:22.017]  Sir?
[01:43:43.650 --> 01:43:49.512]  So you really think Al-Qaeda is a bunch of Arabs, and you really think they attacked us because of our support of Israel?
[01:43:50.572 --> 01:43:55.594]  You really believe the official story, because 9-11 was a government attack.
[01:43:56.494 --> 01:43:59.275]  I mean, it's total theater to say anything else.
[01:44:00.736 --> 01:44:01.696]  No, I don't believe that.
[01:44:01.756 --> 01:44:09.139]  I believe that by trying to talk at this thing about Mel Gibson, the difference between a Zionist and anti-Semitic.
[01:44:09.219 --> 01:44:10.099]  See, they never said...
[01:44:10.945 --> 01:44:11.586]  A Zionist.
[01:44:11.846 --> 01:44:12.746]  What is a Zionist?
[01:44:13.067 --> 01:44:14.388]  Hey, listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:44:14.408 --> 01:44:16.029]  Let me try to boil this down, what you're saying.
[01:44:16.229 --> 01:44:18.951]  And if this is what you're saying, I agree with what you're saying.
[01:44:20.232 --> 01:44:22.674]  What you have is, you have organized crime.
[01:44:23.375 --> 01:44:24.015]  It's real simple.
[01:44:24.035 --> 01:44:26.377]  I mean, I'm sure we've all heard of the Italian Mafia.
[01:44:27.218 --> 01:44:31.681]  Well, if you criticize the Italian Mafia, they don't say, oh, you're anti-Italian.
[01:44:33.562 --> 01:44:37.065]  I mean, this is my view of it, and I've really studied this.
[01:44:37.085 --> 01:44:40.328]  We're not going to defeat the New World Order unless we come together against the New World Order, folks.
[01:44:40.428 --> 01:44:40.528]  But
[01:44:41.570 --> 01:44:55.099]  To try to boil this down, you have, you know, the Italian mafia, the Irish mafia, the German mafia, the big mafia that's the wasp mafia that nobody ever seems to talk about, and you've got the Jewish mafia, you know, Bugsy, Siegel, and all those people.
[01:44:55.679 --> 01:44:58.981]  And so I'm against the Jewish mafia, and the Jewish mafia got smart.
[01:44:59.761 --> 01:45:08.407]  They said, you know, we'll call ourselves Zionists, and we'll use this as an umbrella to carry out our criminal activities, and then if anybody criticizes us, we'll say they're anti-Semitic.
[01:45:09.033 --> 01:45:12.755]  Well, I'm against the WASP Nazi mafia that's skull and bones.
[01:45:13.695 --> 01:45:20.419]  I'm against the Masonic mafia, which at the top is a bunch of different groups working together.
[01:45:21.319 --> 01:45:23.400]  I'm against the German mafia.
[01:45:23.460 --> 01:45:24.641]  I'm against the Jewish mafia.
[01:45:25.161 --> 01:45:27.462]  And I should be able to criticize the Jewish mafia.
[01:45:27.802 --> 01:45:29.503]  That shouldn't be a taboo subject.
[01:45:30.183 --> 01:45:33.745]  And I don't think it is a taboo subject anymore because so many people are pointing it out.
[01:45:35.116 --> 01:45:39.459]  But I think that it's a bigger globalist plan to just say, oh, well, it's Jews.
[01:45:39.499 --> 01:45:43.301]  Well, it's not Jews, and Jews are not the New World Order.
[01:45:43.642 --> 01:45:45.443]  Are Zionists a big part of the New World Order?
[01:45:45.863 --> 01:45:46.224]  Yes.
[01:45:46.604 --> 01:45:49.266]  Is the Jewish mafia a big part of the New World Order?
[01:45:49.406 --> 01:45:55.150]  Yes, because the New World Order, when you boil it all down, is an organized crime syndicate.
[01:45:56.047 --> 01:46:02.033]  And you've got different governing families ruling over different countries and different areas and different sectors of the economy.
[01:46:02.474 --> 01:46:04.636]  And so I'm fighting organized crime.
[01:46:04.936 --> 01:46:06.057]  That's what this show is about.
[01:46:06.117 --> 01:46:07.399]  That's what the New World Order is.
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:14.806]  And so they've got it set up where if you criticize certain mafias, you're supposedly a racist.
[01:46:15.867 --> 01:46:17.209]  It's like the Mexican mafia.
[01:46:18.756 --> 01:46:19.617]  In the Southwest.
[01:46:19.737 --> 01:46:28.486]  Very corrupt, very influential, very powerful, and I criticize the Mexican Mafia and their fronts like Mecha and La Raza and others.
[01:46:28.926 --> 01:46:30.428]  Does that mean I don't like Hispanics?
[01:46:30.468 --> 01:46:31.449]  Well, no, of course not.
[01:46:33.711 --> 01:46:38.596]  And that message, my message, has successfully been telegraphed to Hispanics.
[01:46:39.697 --> 01:46:41.279]  I mean, they're some of the biggest fans of this show.
[01:46:42.052 --> 01:46:43.233]  They understand what I'm saying.
[01:46:43.813 --> 01:46:44.874]  I have Jewish listeners.
[01:46:44.954 --> 01:46:48.877]  I have every group out there listening who wants freedom and liberty.
[01:46:49.657 --> 01:46:53.760]  And so we need to get past labels and fight evil.
[01:46:54.761 --> 01:46:56.742]  But the globalists want to use labels.
[01:46:56.782 --> 01:46:57.903]  They want to label things.
[01:46:57.923 --> 01:46:59.204]  They want to drive a wedge.
[01:46:59.524 --> 01:47:00.645]  They want to balkanize.
[01:47:01.585 --> 01:47:03.707]  Let's talk to Wesley in Tennessee.
[01:47:03.747 --> 01:47:04.487]  Go ahead, Wesley.
[01:47:06.869 --> 01:47:08.010]  Good to talk to you, Wesley.
[01:47:08.290 --> 01:47:09.531]  Hi, how are you today, Alex?
[01:47:09.571 --> 01:47:09.831]  Fine.
[01:47:11.214 --> 01:47:21.960]  I want to go back to a previous story that I think is really important, and that's the story about the man that was arrested for the possession of your videos.
[01:47:23.441 --> 01:47:32.367]  I think the bullseye or the crosshairs that they're aiming for is not a particular individual.
[01:47:32.427 --> 01:47:35.269]  I think what they want to do is set a court precedent
[01:47:36.164 --> 01:47:47.406]  To declare those videos anti-government so they'll have an excuse to prevent people from buying those videos, making copies, and distributing them.
[01:47:47.986 --> 01:47:49.647]  I think that's what this is really all about.
[01:47:49.887 --> 01:47:59.629]  Well, Wesley, I have to tell you from looking at this case, this is a small town in Kentucky, Redonia, and this is good old boy behavior.
[01:47:59.649 --> 01:48:05.830]  The cops see the videos, they get mad, and they say this threatens us, which it doesn't unless they're corrupt,
[01:48:06.522 --> 01:48:08.243]  Then they go and arrest this fella.
[01:48:08.903 --> 01:48:12.244]  Then they try to claim he threatens them in the squad car, which he obviously didn't do.
[01:48:12.725 --> 01:48:22.709]  So I just think it's good old boy boss hog, small town corruption, because, I mean, we've got listeners who give police copies of the videos and the police beg for more copies.
[01:48:23.049 --> 01:48:24.950]  That's the normal response.
[01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:27.170]  That's what we've seen from coast to coast.
[01:48:27.851 --> 01:48:31.052]  You've got this case where cops didn't like him doing what he did.
[01:48:31.352 --> 01:48:33.333]  They think they're God, so they went after him.
[01:48:34.459 --> 01:48:35.639]  I certainly hope you're right.
[01:48:35.659 --> 01:48:37.040]  I hope that's what it is.
[01:48:37.060 --> 01:48:38.680]  Well, it just shows who this judge is.
[01:48:38.700 --> 01:48:45.122]  You know, the judge says, you're guilty of giving a police officer an anti-government, anti-police video.
[01:48:46.402 --> 01:48:48.783]  And so this guy thinks he's God, basically.
[01:48:49.483 --> 01:48:52.744]  And so they want to persecute somebody who told them they were corrupt.
[01:48:54.025 --> 01:48:54.245]  So...
[01:48:56.584 --> 01:48:58.105]  Well, I hope that's all it is.
[01:48:58.165 --> 01:49:00.586]  Maybe I'm just making a mountain out of a molehill.
[01:49:00.626 --> 01:49:02.307]  Well, it's a small town doing it.
[01:49:02.327 --> 01:49:04.768]  If it was the FBI or somebody, I would say yes.
[01:49:05.729 --> 01:49:09.411]  And certainly that's what the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center and others have tried to do.
[01:49:09.751 --> 01:49:19.716]  They're trying to create a chilling effect where they demonize and list gun groups, conservative groups, land rights groups in amongst the Klan and other unsundry groups.
[01:49:20.417 --> 01:49:21.337]  This is the tactic.
[01:49:22.398 --> 01:49:23.318]  But it's not working.
[01:49:23.438 --> 01:49:25.019]  I mean, look at the passion.
[01:49:27.049 --> 01:49:36.932]  Now they're saying over $30 million its first weekend, its first week, and it's on track to make $100 million despite all the demonization.
[01:49:37.652 --> 01:49:38.652]  We're the majority.
[01:49:38.772 --> 01:49:39.893]  We have the power.
[01:49:40.193 --> 01:49:42.553]  We just simply have to move against the New World Order.
[01:49:42.934 --> 01:49:45.574]  All of us have to act as leaders in this fight.
[01:49:46.875 --> 01:49:47.855]  I certainly agree with that.
[01:49:49.082 --> 01:49:52.863]  You're in my daily prayer, so God bless, and let's keep up the good fight.
[01:49:53.123 --> 01:49:54.344]  All right, thank you for the call.
[01:49:54.664 --> 01:49:57.905]  We're going to break here, and I'm going to come back and go through some news.
[01:49:58.545 --> 01:49:59.885]  And boy, there is a lot of it.
[01:50:01.286 --> 01:50:02.986]  And then we've got Greg Palast coming up.
[01:50:03.006 --> 01:50:04.427]  We'll continue to take calls.
[01:50:04.487 --> 01:50:06.467]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:50:06.487 --> 01:50:06.548]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:50:06.588 --> 01:50:08.488]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[01:50:19.989 --> 01:50:24.151]  But when it all comes down to the end of the day, we're fighting evil.
[01:50:24.892 --> 01:50:37.758]  And there's been evil in every corner of the world throughout history, whether it was Japan or Europe or the Americas before the first white man stepped on the new world.
[01:50:37.778 --> 01:50:47.123]  The Indians in northern Central America and in southern North America were engaging in human sacrifice.
[01:50:48.596 --> 01:50:50.717]  And we're just saying no to that mindset.
[01:50:51.977 --> 01:51:02.701]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:51:02.881 --> 01:51:10.464]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:10.724 --> 01:51:13.865]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:51:14.025 --> 01:51:14.405]  We're good to go.
[01:51:32.679 --> 01:51:38.643]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:51:38.863 --> 01:51:43.125]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:43.145 --> 01:51:43.605]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:52.552 --> 01:51:59.916]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:52:00.196 --> 01:52:04.938]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:52:05.158 --> 01:52:10.801]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:52:11.041 --> 01:52:15.565]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:52:15.805 --> 01:52:22.951]  The cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:52:22.972 --> 01:52:27.515]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:52:27.676 --> 01:52:30.198]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:52:30.418 --> 01:52:37.124]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:52:37.344 --> 01:52:38.445]  Or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:52:38.465 --> 01:52:38.725]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:52:51.624 --> 01:52:53.965]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:52:54.225 --> 01:52:58.066]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:52:58.386 --> 01:52:59.187]  Read the labels.
[01:52:59.627 --> 01:53:03.748]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:53:03.969 --> 01:53:08.150]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:53:08.530 --> 01:53:13.412]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:53:13.792 --> 01:53:17.374]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:53:17.574 --> 01:53:22.917]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:53:23.177 --> 01:53:25.918]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:53:26.219 --> 01:53:27.119]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:53:27.419 --> 01:53:38.145]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[01:53:39.946 --> 01:53:41.367]  That's 800-340-7091, or visit calbenpuresoap.com.
[01:53:41.447 --> 01:53:53.914]  Greg Palin is coming on the last 30 minutes of the next hour, so we'll have time to get to all your calls and cover some of the news I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:54:04.241 --> 01:54:15.008]  I want to go to Charles in Louisiana, because while we're on the subject of my videotapes, Charles is one of the people that I know has given out thousands of copies, copies he's made, of the films.
[01:54:15.509 --> 01:54:17.750]  I don't even know if Charles called in about this subject.
[01:54:18.491 --> 01:54:22.734]  But, Charles, what have you seen happen in your area?
[01:54:23.314 --> 01:54:30.659]  Well, Mr. Jones, I've got a hassle four or five times on tapes and different things.
[01:54:31.420 --> 01:54:33.102]  And I got so scared one time.
[01:54:33.142 --> 01:54:34.423]  I was scared I was going to go to jail.
[01:54:35.043 --> 01:54:44.592]  So I went into the sheriff's office, and I took a copy of, I think it was Police 2000, 9-1-1 Road to Tarity.
[01:54:44.892 --> 01:54:47.214]  And I asked him, I said, I've got to ask you, is this against the law?
[01:54:47.575 --> 01:54:49.737]  And I gave him a copy of Vampire 2000.
[01:54:49.857 --> 01:54:52.079]  I said, if it is, you need to tell me.
[01:54:52.492 --> 01:54:53.153]  He said, I'll view it.
[01:54:53.173 --> 01:54:54.314]  Give me a few days and I'll view it.
[01:54:54.414 --> 01:54:54.915]  I went back.
[01:54:54.955 --> 01:54:56.317]  He said, no, you ain't doing nothing wrong.
[01:54:56.337 --> 01:55:01.263]  The police have to ask if giving somebody a news article is illegal?
[01:55:01.643 --> 01:55:03.265]  Give them a C-SPAN video?
[01:55:03.726 --> 01:55:07.671]  I asked them that because I was being hassled by the police.
[01:55:07.751 --> 01:55:09.193]  Now, how many years ago was this?
[01:55:09.213 --> 01:55:10.875]  That was four years ago.
[01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:13.881]  No, about three years ago.
[01:55:14.161 --> 01:55:18.762]  Okay, so three years ago you would be, how would you be harassed for giving out videos?
[01:55:18.802 --> 01:55:26.505]  Well, they even threatened to take my chihuahua away because I was on a public parking lot, I mean, private property, selling flags and all.
[01:55:27.145 --> 01:55:29.626]  And they threatened, they said I couldn't be in there.
[01:55:29.746 --> 01:55:31.186]  Okay, so it was over the flags.
[01:55:31.466 --> 01:55:31.946]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:55:32.147 --> 01:55:34.847]  What was the process like with the videos after they saw them?
[01:55:35.047 --> 01:55:39.729]  Well, after he got it, I had one policeman kind of harassed at me.
[01:55:40.165 --> 01:55:44.026]  For being on church property, giving out Dark Secrets of Bohemian Grove.
[01:55:44.766 --> 01:55:49.067]  And then when a preacher called me up, I mean, a police stopped me.
[01:55:49.087 --> 01:55:50.027]  They said, don't worry about it.
[01:55:50.047 --> 01:55:51.088]  Just don't go on this property.
[01:55:51.428 --> 01:55:53.288]  But I gave them policeman tapes.
[01:55:53.788 --> 01:55:57.049]  I gave out a tape to the judges in Livingston Parish.
[01:55:57.089 --> 01:55:59.209]  I gave out to the clerk of court in Livingston Parish.
[01:55:59.229 --> 01:56:02.650]  I gave out tapes to the detectives up there.
[01:56:03.010 --> 01:56:06.551]  I gave out... Every policeman in them two parishes got tapes from me.
[01:56:07.792 --> 01:56:09.152]  And they said nothing was wrong with it.
[01:56:09.172 --> 01:56:09.772]  Matter of fact,
[01:56:10.253 --> 01:56:17.781]  Half of them asked me to make other tapes and gave me money to buy brain copies, make tapes for them.
[01:56:18.221 --> 01:56:21.564]  Now, what effect did that have over the years of giving them videos?
[01:56:22.125 --> 01:56:24.047]  Well, everybody shakes my hand.
[01:56:24.067 --> 01:56:24.808]  They have called me.
[01:56:24.828 --> 01:56:26.209]  I have breakfast with policemen.
[01:56:26.409 --> 01:56:28.651]  They wouldn't even talk to me before because I'm an ex-convict.
[01:56:28.791 --> 01:56:31.594]  They come over, sit over here, and we buy each other breakfast.
[01:56:32.015 --> 01:56:33.296]  I got to be good friends with them.
[01:56:34.758 --> 01:56:36.339]  Matter of fact, I've been to one of his houses.
[01:56:36.359 --> 01:56:37.739]  Me and my wife went over to his house.
[01:56:37.779 --> 01:56:45.762]  So to show their mindset, at first they didn't know if videotapes were legal, but now they ask you for more copies, now they buy you breakfast.
[01:56:46.322 --> 01:56:50.764]  Well, sometimes, you know, sometimes not every day, but I buy them breakfast one time, and they buy me breakfast.
[01:56:51.064 --> 01:56:51.804]  They know my wife.
[01:56:51.884 --> 01:56:52.885]  I've been over to their house.
[01:56:53.305 --> 01:56:55.026]  What have they said about the New World Order now?
[01:56:55.526 --> 01:56:58.287]  Well, they said that, well, here's what I get from all of this.
[01:56:58.307 --> 01:57:01.108]  They said that the federal government is trying to ruin everybody's life.
[01:57:01.621 --> 01:57:05.024]  Matter of fact, a policeman told me, if I get guns, to bury them.
[01:57:06.165 --> 01:57:12.029]  A policeman told my hand of God, he said, if you get some guns, bury them, because they're going to try to take these guns away from us one day.
[01:57:12.049 --> 01:57:16.173]  A policeman told me that, right there in Wal-Mart.
[01:57:16.393 --> 01:57:18.394]  How many copies of my films have you handed out?
[01:57:18.915 --> 01:57:19.635]  Well, it's over 4,600.
[01:57:19.715 --> 01:57:20.296]  A little over 4,600.
[01:57:24.895 --> 01:57:27.676]  And what has the effect been in your community with the awakening?
[01:57:27.976 --> 01:57:29.876]  Well, people are awakened.
[01:57:29.916 --> 01:57:31.076]  They talk about it now.
[01:57:31.136 --> 01:57:37.378]  They're not scared to talk about it because there's evidence that it's not their opinion, but news articles from the tape.
[01:57:37.898 --> 01:57:39.178]  They talk to police about it.
[01:57:39.818 --> 01:57:44.919]  In the grocery store, I had coffee with four or five people that talk about the tape and other things, too.
[01:57:45.519 --> 01:57:52.100]  I mean, if I wouldn't have did this, if I wouldn't have did it like I did it, I would be scared to talk.
[01:57:52.461 --> 01:57:53.541]  But now the word's out.
[01:57:53.621 --> 01:57:54.561]  It's in Livingston Parish.
[01:57:55.222 --> 01:57:57.044]  And I put them in mailboxes.
[01:57:57.304 --> 01:57:58.425]  Nobody ever harassed me.
[01:57:58.786 --> 01:58:01.949]  But I have got harassed when I first started.
[01:58:02.049 --> 01:58:03.671]  But now, I have a free hand.
[01:58:03.931 --> 01:58:06.674]  I actually go into the police station and pass these things off.
[01:58:06.734 --> 01:58:08.015]  And see, that's how it works.
[01:58:08.115 --> 01:58:11.219]  In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man hated and feared.
[01:58:11.639 --> 01:58:16.384]  In time, when his cause succeeds, the ten would join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[01:58:17.114 --> 01:58:22.279]  And it shows the mindset they first had and how they were awakened to the truth.
[01:58:22.439 --> 01:58:27.543]  And the story you've told is a story I have seen duplicated hundreds of times around the country.
[01:58:27.823 --> 01:58:28.844]  So God bless you, Charles.
[01:58:28.884 --> 01:58:29.765]  I appreciate the call.
[01:58:30.746 --> 01:58:37.231]  And if you want some of these videos, go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call the toll-free number.
[01:58:37.432 --> 01:58:38.352]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:38.372 --> 01:58:38.793]  Stay with us.
[01:58:42.029 --> 01:58:52.757]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.

[01:59:47.930 --> 01:59:48.591]  Big Brother.
[01:59:49.231 --> 01:59:50.312]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:51.013 --> 01:59:52.153]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:52.173 --> 01:59:53.594]  You want answers?
[01:59:54.335 --> 01:59:55.276]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:55.916 --> 01:59:59.559]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:00.099 --> 02:00:04.222]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:06.884 --> 02:00:12.668]  All right, my friends, we're now into the third and final hour of this Live Tuesday edition of
[02:00:13.243 --> 02:00:16.144]  We're about to go back to your calls, but let me cover some news for the time being.
[02:00:16.864 --> 02:00:20.465]  CDC knew a potential link between vaccines and autism.
[02:00:20.485 --> 02:00:22.966]  This is out of ABC News 25.
[02:00:24.426 --> 02:00:31.948]  Five-year-old Ryan Anderson of Jacksonville Beach is an animated happy child, but that wasn't always the case.
[02:00:33.409 --> 02:00:37.070]  His course of deterioration from a happy, developmentally successful,
[02:00:38.271 --> 02:00:47.276]  Appropriate child to the problems he began to develop started right after he received the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine as Ryan's father, Bruce Anderson.
[02:00:47.896 --> 02:00:57.140]  Now, several therapies are underway to restore Ryan's cognitive and behavioral development, which began to show significant impairment at the age of 18 months.
[02:00:57.321 --> 02:01:02.183]  Ryan also presents evidence of a persistent active measles virus.
[02:01:03.129 --> 02:01:03.710]  You understand?
[02:01:04.030 --> 02:01:05.872]  He gets the measles, mumps, rubella shot.
[02:01:06.332 --> 02:01:10.236]  He has the measles now in his blood that is persistent and active.
[02:01:10.616 --> 02:01:14.260]  Whereas if you normally get measles, you get it, you get an immunity to it, it goes away.
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:17.383]  You take these weird shots, you keep the measles.
[02:01:18.223 --> 02:01:20.986]  There's weird stuff in your blood, weird stuff in your bowels.
[02:01:21.026 --> 02:01:22.187]  This is the standard thing.
[02:01:22.667 --> 02:01:24.589]  And you've got this high level of mercury.
[02:01:24.850 --> 02:01:26.191]  This is ABC News, folks.
[02:01:27.774 --> 02:01:33.856]  Ryan's doctor, Jeff Branstreet of Melbourne, is a specialist in autism-related disorders.
[02:01:34.196 --> 02:01:36.057]  He's in clinical diagnostic testing.
[02:01:36.357 --> 02:01:40.018]  He has documented a genetic effect in children that Ryan carries.
[02:01:40.258 --> 02:01:46.600]  The defect, says Branstreet, made him vulnerable to the persistent and the preservatives in his vaccinations.
[02:01:47.259 --> 02:01:51.845]  Preservative is called Tamarisol, and it contains mercury, a known neurotoxin.
[02:01:52.186 --> 02:02:00.437]  Until just a few years ago, children who received a full schedule of vaccinations were injected with mercury in amounts that were exceeding EPA guidelines.
[02:02:01.229 --> 02:02:06.593]  Again, we're injected with mercury in amounts far exceeding EPA guidelines.
[02:02:07.133 --> 02:02:12.878]  Brad Street says some children's bodies just can't handle the onslaught of the toxin.
[02:02:12.958 --> 02:02:16.580]  Quote, there are children who don't detox heavy metals well.
[02:02:16.821 --> 02:02:21.384]  The more mercury we expose them to, the more problems they're going to have, Brad Street said.
[02:02:22.262 --> 02:02:27.766]  A growing controversy over thimerosal contributed to the removal from many childhood vaccines.
[02:02:27.806 --> 02:02:28.446]  That's not true.
[02:02:28.946 --> 02:02:30.367]  Beginning in the late 1990s.
[02:02:30.407 --> 02:02:34.630]  But it's still present in some vaccinations, including virtually all flu shots.
[02:02:36.411 --> 02:02:43.956]  Yeah, the flu shot they gave out last year, end of this year, has over 200 times the safe level of mercury in it.
[02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:57.938]  Documents released through the Freedom of Information Act, we covered months ago here, detail the transcript of a meeting held in June 2000 between members of the CDC and the FDA and representatives from the vaccine industry.
[02:02:58.539 --> 02:03:09.946]  The group discussed the results of a February 2000 study that finds a significant association between exposure to thimerosal containing vaccines and developmental issues like autism in children.
[02:03:11.487 --> 02:03:13.969]  And then the article goes on, that's just the first page,
[02:03:14.614 --> 02:03:31.178]  With the fact that the CDC knew this, but continued to put it in the vaccines, continued to say it was good for the children, continued to allow the vaccine makers to do it, and they all discussed how to engage in this activity in collusion together.
[02:03:31.638 --> 02:03:42.661]  So the vaccine makers, the Centers for Disease Control, the Food and Drug Administration, knowingly, and this has been going on for a long time, not just since 2000, knowingly allowed this to happen.
[02:03:44.051 --> 02:03:53.461]  We've gone from one autism case per 25,000 over 20 years ago to one in 168 children now.
[02:03:54.682 --> 02:03:56.263]  And it's only getting worse.
[02:03:56.444 --> 02:04:01.609]  A plague of brain damage and learning disabilities and autism.
[02:04:02.535 --> 02:04:06.198]  And it makes me very angry that this just continues.
[02:04:06.318 --> 02:04:12.482]  And still the average American has no idea this is going on when they demand your children take these shots.
[02:04:12.922 --> 02:04:15.364]  You do not have to vaccinate your children.
[02:04:16.464 --> 02:04:18.546]  Then they'll say, oh, your child will die of something else.
[02:04:20.419 --> 02:04:23.483]  Statistically, it's more dangerous to take these vaccines than to not.
[02:04:23.743 --> 02:04:28.648]  Now, I'm not going to give you medical advice, but you better look at the evidence of this, and you better make your own decision.
[02:04:29.269 --> 02:04:31.131]  And again, we told you about this years ago.
[02:04:31.712 --> 02:04:34.915]  We went back over this months ago, and here it is from ABC News.
[02:04:35.876 --> 02:04:38.639]  We'll come back, get into more news, and take your calls.
[02:04:38.699 --> 02:04:39.180]  Stay with us.
[02:04:44.478 --> 02:04:50.541]  Most so-called tax shelters try to show you how to reduce your taxes, but they still insist that you must pay taxes.
[02:04:50.921 --> 02:04:57.184]  And they require that you do goofy, bizarre things with your money that you'd never normally do just so you can save a few bucks.
[02:04:57.844 --> 02:04:58.945]  Not this tax shelter.
[02:04:59.405 --> 02:05:07.889]  It's so complete, it's so superior, that it will teach you how to properly comply with the tax laws and still end up with zero tax liability.
[02:05:08.189 --> 02:05:12.211]  Imagine, you find out that you've been deceived about what the tax laws require
[02:05:12.791 --> 02:05:15.712]  And you learn how to obey them better than you ever have before.
[02:05:15.892 --> 02:05:18.432]  And as a result, you end up owing the government nothing.
[02:05:18.833 --> 02:05:22.173]  You get to keep every single dime of your hard-earned money.
[02:05:22.573 --> 02:05:23.274]  Sound amazing?
[02:05:23.694 --> 02:05:24.774]  Sound too good to be true?
[02:05:25.314 --> 02:05:26.314]  Find out for yourself.
[02:05:26.834 --> 02:05:29.055]  Go to besttaxshelter.com.
[02:05:29.075 --> 02:05:33.436]  That's besttaxshelter, all one word, dot com on the internet.
[02:05:33.756 --> 02:05:36.177]  And find out what the government has been scared to death.
[02:05:36.197 --> 02:05:36.857]  You'll find out.
[02:05:37.537 --> 02:05:39.578]  Besttaxshelter.com.
[02:05:39.658 --> 02:05:40.538]  You'll be astonished.
[02:05:40.798 --> 02:05:41.378]  Visit today.
[02:05:43.195 --> 02:05:46.477]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:05:46.537 --> 02:05:50.700]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:05:50.960 --> 02:05:53.742]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:05:53.942 --> 02:05:56.343]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:05:56.523 --> 02:06:05.188]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:06:05.369 --> 02:06:06.729]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:06:06.910 --> 02:06:11.032]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:06:11.032 --> 02:06:11.713]  We're good to go.
[02:06:30.353 --> 02:06:30.993]  We're good to go.
[02:06:55.330 --> 02:06:59.094]  The New World Order can emerge.
[02:06:59.375 --> 02:07:03.600]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:07:03.680 --> 02:07:10.609]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:07:10.749 --> 02:07:12.752]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:07:12.972 --> 02:07:23.436]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:07:23.736 --> 02:07:29.098]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:07:48.062 --> 02:07:48.702]  Big Brother.
[02:07:49.362 --> 02:07:50.423]  Mainstream media.
[02:07:51.123 --> 02:07:52.244]  Government cover-ups.
[02:07:52.884 --> 02:07:53.704]  You want answers?
[02:07:54.465 --> 02:07:55.405]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:56.025 --> 02:07:59.687]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:00.207 --> 02:08:04.329]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:06.130 --> 02:08:07.530]  Welcome back, my friends.
[02:08:08.110 --> 02:08:11.412]  We've got Greg Pallas coming up from the BBC.
[02:08:12.352 --> 02:08:13.813]  Your call's here in just a few minutes.
[02:08:14.514 --> 02:08:15.614]  And here are some of the quotes
[02:08:42.364 --> 02:08:45.085]  From the transcript of the meeting, some of the comments.
[02:08:45.145 --> 02:08:45.745]  Listen to these.
[02:08:46.845 --> 02:08:53.886]  There are just a host of neurodevelopmental data that would suggest we've got a serious problem.
[02:08:54.306 --> 02:08:55.787]  My gut feeling it worries me.
[02:08:56.227 --> 02:09:01.548]  I don't want my grandson to get the thimerosal-containing vaccine until we know better what's going on.
[02:09:02.468 --> 02:09:06.169]  We are all in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits.
[02:09:06.409 --> 02:09:12.050]  Finally, we have asked you to keep this information confidential
[02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:13.520]  And that's what happened.
[02:09:13.841 --> 02:09:25.286]  Three years later, the CDC published a study in the November 2003 issue of Pediatrics contradicting the earlier results and clearing thimerosal of any link to neurological problems in children.
[02:09:27.847 --> 02:09:29.608]  So, they're just going to keep doing this.
[02:09:29.688 --> 02:09:30.349]  They don't care.
[02:09:30.389 --> 02:09:30.989]  And understand...
[02:09:32.856 --> 02:09:34.016]  This is a side issue.
[02:09:34.036 --> 02:09:36.657]  To just focus in on thimerosal as a mistake.
[02:09:36.997 --> 02:09:49.719]  See, they can say, well, we've taken it out of some of the vaccines, but it's going to stay in the MMR and stay in the flu shot and stay in the tetanus shot, all the major injections that they give babies, toddlers, and adults.
[02:09:49.759 --> 02:09:50.919]  It's bad for adults as well.
[02:09:51.379 --> 02:09:52.299]  That's going to continue.
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:58.901]  But it's kind of a side issue of, okay, it was thimerosal, we'll do something about it, we'll take it out of some of the vaccines.
[02:09:59.201 --> 02:10:01.621]  No, they've been caught putting other stuff in these shots.
[02:10:02.469 --> 02:10:11.654]  You know, this article gets into how these babies, these toddlers, take the measles shot, then they get some bizarre form of measles that doesn't go away.
[02:10:11.714 --> 02:10:13.936]  They just have measles all the time.
[02:10:16.437 --> 02:10:18.798]  It just ruins the bowels of these children.
[02:10:18.818 --> 02:10:26.163]  They take these shots and then they're incontinent for the rest of their life with bizarre living viruses in their intestines.
[02:10:27.784 --> 02:10:29.605]  This is being done by design, folks.
[02:10:29.745 --> 02:10:30.165]  I have the 1973...
[02:10:32.176 --> 02:10:35.037]  Dr. Henry Kissinger's CIA documents.
[02:10:35.077 --> 02:10:36.577]  These were declassified in 1992.
[02:10:38.478 --> 02:10:39.138]  And I have them.
[02:10:39.158 --> 02:10:41.079]  We've posted them many times on the site.
[02:10:41.119 --> 02:10:41.919]  They're there right now.
[02:10:42.559 --> 02:10:51.802]  And Henry Kissinger tells the third world countries, a whole list of them, if you want IMF and World Bank money, you've got to forcibly sterilize half your population.
[02:10:53.263 --> 02:10:59.145]  Then they go into ways to do it through vaccines or through forcing women to have their tubes tied.
[02:10:59.445 --> 02:11:00.125]  It's horrible.
[02:11:01.275 --> 02:11:05.299]  I've got documents out of Australia, documents out of England, documents out of the U.S.
[02:11:05.319 --> 02:11:09.002]  government, going back into the 50s, right through the 90s.
[02:11:09.322 --> 02:11:10.863]  This is just the declassified stuff.
[02:11:11.064 --> 02:11:12.625]  Can you imagine what's classified?
[02:11:12.645 --> 02:11:20.392]  Where they talk about exterminating us, using biological weapons, engineering race-specific weapons.
[02:11:20.512 --> 02:11:21.132]  It's happening.
[02:11:21.192 --> 02:11:21.893]  It's going on.
[02:11:24.269 --> 02:11:27.232]  But you notice Jesse Jackson and others don't want to talk about this.
[02:11:27.452 --> 02:11:31.936]  So the magnitude of all these subjects, I don't have words to describe how serious this is.
[02:11:33.157 --> 02:11:33.457]  I don't.
[02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:39.043]  There's no way to describe how serious this is.
[02:11:40.304 --> 02:11:45.448]  But the average person can't grasp that there are evil people engaging in these types of activities.
[02:11:46.129 --> 02:11:46.970]  It's just that simple.
[02:11:49.443 --> 02:11:50.943]  Now, I have my call list here.
[02:11:51.003 --> 02:11:51.944]  I'm down in Austin, Texas.
[02:11:51.964 --> 02:11:54.684]  They're up in Minnesota, and I write down who the callers are.
[02:11:54.744 --> 02:11:59.386]  I've got a computer I can do it on, but every once in a while I lose my call list.
[02:11:59.446 --> 02:12:01.886]  I know we've got loaded phones, and I don't know who's up next.
[02:12:03.167 --> 02:12:04.587]  Lisa in Michigan, go ahead.
[02:12:04.607 --> 02:12:05.748]  Hi, Alex.
[02:12:05.808 --> 02:12:06.688]  How you doing?
[02:12:06.928 --> 02:12:07.608]  I'm doing okay.
[02:12:08.428 --> 02:12:16.711]  Listen, we just found out a couple days ago on February 12th that the Nassara bill is not a dead bill.
[02:12:17.091 --> 02:12:17.731]  In fact, it was...
[02:12:18.669 --> 02:12:19.849]  Passed secretly on March 9, 2000.
[02:12:20.089 --> 02:12:24.450]  Hey, Nassera is not real.
[02:12:25.931 --> 02:12:27.391]  Well, it was secretly paid.
[02:12:27.471 --> 02:12:28.191]  No, that's not true.
[02:12:29.171 --> 02:12:30.152]  That's what they wanted.
[02:12:30.172 --> 02:12:32.252]  There's a gag order on that.
[02:12:32.912 --> 02:12:34.572]  And it was secretly passed on March 9, 2000.
[02:12:34.773 --> 02:12:38.493]  Okay, for those that just joined us, why don't you tell people what Nassera claims to be?
[02:12:39.213 --> 02:12:45.955]  Well, Nassera gives forgiveness of credit card, mortgage debt, and other bank loans as remedy for bank and government fraud.
[02:12:46.565 --> 02:12:52.929]  Alex is the IRS, creates flat rate, non-essential, new items only, sales tax revenue for government.
[02:12:52.949 --> 02:12:55.971]  It restores constitutional law.
[02:12:56.331 --> 02:12:57.372]  It initiates U.S.
[02:12:57.432 --> 02:13:01.895]  Treasury bank system, which absorbs the Federal Reserve and new precious metal-backed U.S.
[02:13:01.915 --> 02:13:02.876]  Treasury currency.
[02:13:02.896 --> 02:13:07.979]  I don't know much about it, Alex, but they requested it to the world.
[02:13:09.969 --> 02:13:12.370]  To the World Court as we speak right now.
[02:13:12.471 --> 02:13:14.792]  Well, you say you don't know much about it.
[02:13:15.132 --> 02:13:15.392]  I do.
[02:13:15.432 --> 02:13:20.415]  Well, we just found out about it, but we do know it was secretly passed on March 9th.
[02:13:20.855 --> 02:13:21.776]  And how do you know that?
[02:13:22.536 --> 02:13:24.538]  I'm going to fax the documents to you today.
[02:13:24.558 --> 02:13:29.861]  You mean you're going to fax the stuff that's on the Internet to me?
[02:13:30.241 --> 02:13:32.382]  Well, they got a gag order on it.
[02:13:32.462 --> 02:13:35.724]  Well, Lisa, I'm not trying to be mean to you, but I live this.
[02:13:35.764 --> 02:13:36.825]  This is my life, okay?
[02:13:37.706 --> 02:13:49.190]  And they came out a few years ago and said everything's all right, the government secretly passed laws reinstituting the Constitution, and everything's okay now.
[02:13:49.550 --> 02:13:59.894]  Meanwhile, they're passing Patriot Act 1 and 2, all this stuff's happening, and there's this rumor that there's this secret law that was passed, and everything's okay now, and I'm telling you, it's not true.
[02:14:00.649 --> 02:14:06.754]  Well, it says that there was four petitions the World Court submitted by the banking system with the Illuminati.
[02:14:06.894 --> 02:14:08.495]  They're trying to stop this, Alex.
[02:14:09.016 --> 02:14:12.058]  They're trying to stop this because it's going to make them go down.
[02:14:12.638 --> 02:14:13.059]  Ma'am?
[02:14:13.319 --> 02:14:13.619]  Ma'am?
[02:14:14.300 --> 02:14:14.420]  Uh-huh?
[02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:19.484]  If I talk about something, it's documented, I have the bills, I have the legislation, I have the news.
[02:14:20.064 --> 02:14:25.909]  Why would the globalists, why would Congress pass a law secretly reinstituting the Constitution?
[02:14:27.262 --> 02:14:35.886]  Why would these controlled, bought-and-paid-for, new-world-order people that are publicly passing all this evil legislation secretly pass good legislation?
[02:14:36.547 --> 02:14:37.727]  Hey, Alex, you know what?
[02:14:37.847 --> 02:14:40.729]  It seems to be a good thing, but you know what?
[02:14:40.889 --> 02:14:42.410]  It's not going to be a good thing.
[02:14:42.450 --> 02:14:43.630]  There's more to it than that.
[02:14:43.750 --> 02:14:49.573]  After that, they're going to implement a Sunday law, which is... I'm not real sure if you know about that.
[02:14:49.613 --> 02:14:50.734]  Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.
[02:14:50.754 --> 02:14:50.914]  Uh-huh?
[02:14:51.654 --> 02:14:53.235]  Nassera is not real.
[02:14:53.695 --> 02:14:55.336]  Well, I'm going to... I could go... Hold on.
[02:14:55.496 --> 02:14:56.777]  I could go start a website...
[02:14:57.905 --> 02:15:09.954]  And say that I had Easter bunnies hatching out in my backyard, and that a secret law had been passed concerning the Easter bunnies, and the government was blocking it, and it's not true.
[02:15:10.734 --> 02:15:13.136]  It's an urban legend.
[02:15:13.676 --> 02:15:24.824]  Okay, a doctor from out in Hillsdale County was telling us that this is true, and they're trying to keep it.
[02:15:24.884 --> 02:15:26.185]  It's not a good thing, though, Alex.
[02:15:26.961 --> 02:15:29.103]  They got a gag thing on it.
[02:15:29.363 --> 02:15:30.444]  They got a gag thing?
[02:15:30.664 --> 02:15:32.166]  Yeah, they got a gag order on it.
[02:15:32.206 --> 02:15:38.411]  In fact, they said, if you say anything about this at all, you're going to face charges of treason and punishment by death.
[02:15:38.511 --> 02:15:40.212]  This is what they're telling the U.S.
[02:15:40.232 --> 02:15:40.973]  Supreme Court.
[02:15:41.053 --> 02:15:42.554]  This is basic craziness.
[02:15:42.754 --> 02:15:44.175]  I know it is.
[02:15:44.596 --> 02:15:50.060]  But what I think you need to know, I think it's weird, too, but I want you to know and I want you to check it out.
[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:50.781]  Don't believe me.
[02:15:50.821 --> 02:15:51.582]  I want you to check it out.
[02:15:51.622 --> 02:15:53.503]  Ma'am, did you not hear me, Lisa?
[02:15:53.924 --> 02:15:55.445]  I have checked it out for three years.
[02:15:56.365 --> 02:16:00.648]  Okay, well, this is the stuff that's getting forwarded to us, and it's in the world.
[02:16:01.008 --> 02:16:01.828]  They're waiting for it.
[02:16:02.169 --> 02:16:05.971]  They requested it right now, and they're waiting for it to process.
[02:16:06.011 --> 02:16:07.912]  Hey, Lisa, I'm not here criticizing you.
[02:16:07.932 --> 02:16:14.637]  I mean, it's okay that you called up asking me about Nasera, but I keep telling you that I have researched it, and you tell me I need to research it.
[02:16:15.017 --> 02:16:17.118]  I'm telling you it's an urban legend.
[02:16:17.518 --> 02:16:21.281]  The government didn't secretly make everything all right and give us our rights back.
[02:16:21.981 --> 02:16:22.941]  It's just not true.
[02:16:22.961 --> 02:16:24.282]  Well, it's not all right.
[02:16:24.402 --> 02:16:26.903]  It seems like a good thing, but it's not.
[02:16:27.283 --> 02:16:28.243]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[02:16:28.583 --> 02:16:30.324]  It didn't sound like I'm going to convince you.
[02:16:30.824 --> 02:16:41.387]  All right, everybody's running around going, the government's really good, and they secretly overthrew the New World Order in 2000, and the New World Order is covering this up.
[02:16:42.759 --> 02:16:51.421]  If that was the case, this same Congress wouldn't be passing Patriot Act 1 and 2 and Homeland Security and all the stuff that's happening.
[02:16:51.521 --> 02:16:52.781]  It's not true.
[02:16:53.942 --> 02:16:55.662]  I've talked to members of Congress.
[02:16:56.302 --> 02:16:57.843]  This era is not real.
[02:16:57.923 --> 02:16:58.643]  Who's up next?
[02:17:00.703 --> 02:17:02.084]  Bob in Wisconsin, go ahead.
[02:17:03.104 --> 02:17:11.026]  Alex, I don't know if you heard this or not, but last night for about an hour, I heard on the radio a gal by the name of Beverly Harris.
[02:17:12.065 --> 02:17:20.052]  Who today is in court in Los Angeles bringing out charges against the voting machine scam that's going on.
[02:17:20.072 --> 02:17:23.655]  Yeah, we've had Bev Harris on about 25 times.
[02:17:23.915 --> 02:17:24.415]  Oh, you have?
[02:17:24.856 --> 02:17:25.516]  Yeah, we have.
[02:17:25.977 --> 02:17:32.582]  And she's just one of the good people out there exposing that the CIA runs these companies, that it's a complete and total fraud.
[02:17:33.162 --> 02:17:37.306]  Okay, I haven't heard it on... Excuse me?
[02:17:37.566 --> 02:17:40.889]  The thing about going to Mars is a big scam.
[02:17:41.792 --> 02:17:46.335]  That money is going to be used for war into space.
[02:17:47.376 --> 02:17:48.397]  It's going to cost us.
[02:17:49.238 --> 02:17:49.458]  Sure.
[02:17:50.879 --> 02:17:51.199]  All right.
[02:17:51.379 --> 02:17:52.480]  Your phone's breaking up.
[02:17:52.540 --> 02:17:53.041]  I'm sorry.
[02:17:53.061 --> 02:17:54.922]  I'm going to have to let you go.
[02:17:55.602 --> 02:17:56.603]  Who's up after him?
[02:17:57.524 --> 02:17:58.304]  Tim in Ohio.
[02:17:58.345 --> 02:17:58.805]  Go ahead.
[02:17:59.585 --> 02:18:00.326]  Alex, how are you doing?
[02:18:00.686 --> 02:18:00.986]  Fine.
[02:18:01.267 --> 02:18:01.907]  I said it before.
[02:18:01.967 --> 02:18:02.508]  I'll say it again.
[02:18:02.628 --> 02:18:05.370]  I can feel your pain on some of these callers.
[02:18:05.550 --> 02:18:06.371]  They don't want to believe you.
[02:18:06.391 --> 02:18:09.413]  If it's something you've researched for three years, give me a break.
[02:18:10.632 --> 02:18:12.493]  Have you ever heard of a website called Burke's Pirate?
[02:18:13.414 --> 02:18:13.674]  No.
[02:18:14.395 --> 02:18:23.602]  I was flipping around on there, and some interesting things I came across said that Clinton and the Bushes are all part of branches of the Lee family tree in China.
[02:18:24.282 --> 02:18:25.603]  That's something for you to check out.
[02:18:26.043 --> 02:18:27.244]  I thought that was pretty interesting.
[02:18:27.825 --> 02:18:36.311]  Well, I know that the Lee family runs China, whether it's Mao Zedong in power or the emperors before Mao.
[02:18:37.492 --> 02:18:37.632]  And
[02:18:38.553 --> 02:18:52.138]  I know that the globalists are all interrelated in Europe, and I know that there's been some intermarrying with some of the big dynasties in Asia, but I don't know the particulars of what you just said.
[02:18:52.819 --> 02:18:54.860]  Earlier, I read the Star Bulletin article.
[02:18:55.380 --> 02:18:57.781]  Genealogists call Bush Terry Ken.
[02:18:58.301 --> 02:19:02.903]  Big Isle researchers claim the president and his top opponent are distant cousins.
[02:19:03.483 --> 02:19:05.604]  Well, like you mentioned before, everyone knows that they're both...
[02:19:06.343 --> 02:19:09.505]  It's called in bone, so it's like different masks on the same face.
[02:19:10.786 --> 02:19:12.366]  Yeah, they give us false choices.
[02:19:12.607 --> 02:19:14.287]  And people get fooled by it all the time.
[02:19:14.568 --> 02:19:22.132]  Also on there, they talked about 34 of 43 presidents being related or coming from the bloodline of King Alfred and Charlemagne.
[02:19:23.883 --> 02:19:25.204]  Well, they brag about that.
[02:19:25.564 --> 02:19:30.445]  And it's true that the Bushes are directly related to the Queen of England.
[02:19:30.485 --> 02:19:31.726]  That's from Reuters as well.
[02:19:31.746 --> 02:19:32.106]  Sure.
[02:19:32.726 --> 02:19:35.227]  And they were Tories during the Revolutionary War.
[02:19:35.307 --> 02:19:36.608]  They've been traitors all along.
[02:19:37.728 --> 02:19:38.448]  Interesting call.
[02:19:38.488 --> 02:19:38.948]  Thank you.
[02:19:39.128 --> 02:19:40.849]  More news coming up, then Greg Palast.
[02:19:45.111 --> 02:19:46.871]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[02:19:47.391 --> 02:19:50.813]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[02:19:51.313 --> 02:19:51.933]  Let's update.
[02:19:52.492 --> 02:19:55.934]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[02:19:56.594 --> 02:20:00.316]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[02:20:00.996 --> 02:20:01.937]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[02:20:01.977 --> 02:20:04.298]  dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[02:20:04.818 --> 02:20:05.718]  Today, the U.S.
[02:20:05.738 --> 02:20:07.959]  dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[02:20:08.380 --> 02:20:09.900]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[02:20:10.481 --> 02:20:12.462]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283.
[02:20:13.822 --> 02:20:18.684]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[02:20:19.665 --> 02:20:20.425]  Gold is moving.
[02:20:20.685 --> 02:20:21.826]  Equities are treading waters.
[02:20:22.233 --> 02:20:24.874]  This is a little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[02:20:25.415 --> 02:20:26.795]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[02:20:27.236 --> 02:20:28.957]  Physical possession, private gold.
[02:20:29.357 --> 02:20:31.338]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[02:20:31.738 --> 02:20:33.859]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.

[02:21:43.041 --> 02:21:45.022]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[02:21:45.102 --> 02:21:45.763]  Hello, folks.
[02:21:45.883 --> 02:21:55.808]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:21:56.189 --> 02:22:00.711]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:22:00.791 --> 02:22:12.118]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste, and odors are separated from the water.
[02:22:12.498 --> 02:22:13.179]  We're good to go.
[02:22:38.797 --> 02:22:44.759]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:22:44.919 --> 02:22:46.059]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:22:46.239 --> 02:22:49.640]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:22:49.740 --> 02:22:57.542]  Phenol, ingestion of even small amounts, may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:22:57.902 --> 02:23:02.003]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:23:02.103 --> 02:23:02.563]  Fragrance?
[02:23:02.943 --> 02:23:07.684]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:23:07.824 --> 02:23:12.525]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[02:23:12.746 --> 02:23:15.306]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[02:23:15.566 --> 02:23:18.967]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:23:19.127 --> 02:23:22.688]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:23:22.868 --> 02:23:23.148]  No hard
[02:23:23.909 --> 02:23:25.230]  No pork or beef tallow.
[02:23:25.390 --> 02:23:26.271]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:23:26.391 --> 02:23:36.141]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.
[02:23:36.342 --> 02:23:38.864]  Call Cal Bend toll free, 1-800-340-7091 or visit CalBendPureSoap.com.
[02:23:49.873 --> 02:24:00.686]  One of the best places to find out what the globalists and their minions and their allied crime syndicates are up to, one of the best places to research their activities, is the business wire.
[02:24:01.828 --> 02:24:06.734]  This is where big corporations put out press releases about what they're up to, what they're doing.
[02:24:08.058 --> 02:24:18.184]  I mean, you find stuff in there where Applied Digital wants to put microchips in every child in the country and wants to put it in all the prisoners and the Alzheimer's patients and foreigners and the general public.
[02:24:18.225 --> 02:24:25.609]  You find out the Communist Chinese own them on the business wire because this is corporations communicating with each other.
[02:24:25.909 --> 02:24:31.533]  This is their own statements, their own quotes, not just some news article by a reporter with an agenda.
[02:24:33.494 --> 02:24:34.535]  Now, for the last...
[02:24:35.504 --> 02:24:47.288]  I don't know, 15 years or so, probably longer than that now, armored vehicles in a program of the Defense Department, M-16s, military training, have been transferred to police departments.
[02:24:47.468 --> 02:25:00.073]  In the last six years, ground-penetrating radar that looks right through your walls and gives them a crisp image of what's going on inside your home has been mounted on police helicopters by the Defense Department.
[02:25:00.598 --> 02:25:05.539]  Again, getting rid of Posse Comitatus, setting up this martial law atmosphere.
[02:25:06.179 --> 02:25:11.161]  Well, this is out of Anniston, Alabama, Business Wire, from yesterday, February 16, 2004.
[02:25:11.301 --> 02:25:16.342]  It's on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:25:17.582 --> 02:25:21.643]  Surplus Army vehicles find new life in error of Homeland Security.
[02:25:22.381 --> 02:25:24.802]  Now again, folks, they were deploying these long before 9-11.
[02:25:25.802 --> 02:25:27.123]  But see, now that's their excuse.
[02:25:27.803 --> 02:25:33.905]  United Defense supports Calhoun County Sheriff's receipt of tactical command post vehicle.
[02:25:34.685 --> 02:25:39.567]  Did you ever wonder what happens to excess Army tracked vehicles?
[02:25:40.467 --> 02:25:47.670]  United Defense Industries Incorporated is supporting a unique solution that supports local law enforcement and homeland security needs.
[02:25:49.113 --> 02:25:54.835]  It converts surplus military vehicles into domestic law enforcement units for special situations.
[02:25:55.475 --> 02:26:04.678]  A Calhoun County Sheriff's Office in Alabama will soon receive the first of two 12-ton tactical command post vehicles for its emergency services unit.
[02:26:05.238 --> 02:26:17.323]  Overhauled by United Defense, the Sheriff's Office acquired a surplus armored tracked vehicle from the Department of Defense through its law enforcement support organization, 1033 Programs.
[02:26:19.190 --> 02:26:30.323]  In a cooperative effort between the United Defense Industries and the Sheriff's Office, United Defense, the official equipment manufacturer agreed to perform the readiness maintenance work on the vehicle.
[02:26:32.003 --> 02:26:37.124]  The Tactical Command Post Vehicle is a member of the M113 family of vehicles.
[02:26:37.624 --> 02:26:45.006]  United Defense upgrades similar vehicles at its Anniston facility in a joint partnership with the Anniston Army Depot.
[02:26:45.466 --> 02:26:53.608]  By the way, the Anniston Army Depot is a civilian inmate labor camp program where they have a prison right next door and they use prisoners to do this.
[02:26:53.688 --> 02:26:57.629]  So that's part of the civilian inmate labor camp program that we've exposed.
[02:26:58.289 --> 02:27:00.810]  Yes, it's a camp, folks, a labor camp.
[02:27:01.488 --> 02:27:20.314]  The M113 family of vehicles is currently being used by law enforcement and other first responders in over 27 states and assist in natural disasters, and listen to this, search and rescue operations, counter-drug operations, riot crowd control, and other related homeland defense applications.
[02:27:20.414 --> 02:27:20.654]  See?
[02:27:21.554 --> 02:27:23.515]  See, oppressing us as homeland defense.
[02:27:24.215 --> 02:27:29.817]  Over the past five years, vehicles have been outfitted to perform specific operations associated with SWAT,
[02:27:30.620 --> 02:27:31.800]  Border Patrol, U.S.
[02:27:31.860 --> 02:27:34.281]  Marshals, FBI, and Forest Service.
[02:27:34.401 --> 02:27:35.301]  Oh, the Forest Service.
[02:27:35.661 --> 02:27:37.882]  With few modifications from the original design.
[02:27:38.982 --> 02:27:54.466]  Some law enforcement agencies that use their vehicles primarily in urban areas have equipped their vehicles with a band track, a one-piece high-strength polymer rubber that reduces maintenance, road noise, and vibration for an improved ride quality.
[02:27:55.247 --> 02:27:56.447]  These are large vehicles.
[02:27:57.745 --> 02:27:58.986]  Treaded tanks.
[02:27:59.446 --> 02:28:04.029]  They're not just the little APCs that we've seen in past years.
[02:28:05.410 --> 02:28:10.413]  And it says the vehicle handoff ceremony will take place Tuesday, February 17th at 10 a.m.
[02:28:10.453 --> 02:28:11.914]  So this already happened earlier today.
[02:28:12.475 --> 02:28:17.198]  At the United Defense Street Products Facility at 1805 Coleman Road, Anniston.
[02:28:17.698 --> 02:28:27.144]  Mr. Jim Walker, Director of the Alabama Department of Homeland Security, and Mr. Don Sherrod, President of the National Law Enforcement Support Association, will speak at the event.
[02:28:28.948 --> 02:28:31.550]  And this is just one of many companies doing this.
[02:28:31.690 --> 02:28:33.731]  APD has three of these.
[02:28:34.392 --> 02:28:36.613]  The Sheriff's Department, I think, has one now.
[02:28:37.174 --> 02:28:40.556]  The state police here in Austin, I know, have four of them.
[02:28:40.596 --> 02:28:41.636]  I've got video of them.
[02:28:42.137 --> 02:28:43.278]  And that was years ago.
[02:28:44.458 --> 02:28:46.700]  And so here they are, Homeland Security.
[02:28:47.458 --> 02:28:49.218]  Giving the tanks to local police.
[02:28:49.278 --> 02:28:50.078]  Homeland Security.
[02:28:50.399 --> 02:28:51.939]  The end of posse commentatus.
[02:28:51.979 --> 02:28:53.659]  They say they want to put troops on the streets.
[02:28:53.979 --> 02:28:57.720]  They say after another attack, we go to martial law.
[02:28:57.980 --> 02:28:59.900]  And I know I've been repeating that a lot lately.
[02:29:00.260 --> 02:29:01.400]  It is such a big deal.
[02:29:03.121 --> 02:29:04.821]  But just hidden in plain view.
[02:29:05.701 --> 02:29:06.101]  Riot.
[02:29:06.521 --> 02:29:08.242]  Crowd control with their tanks.
[02:29:08.442 --> 02:29:09.922]  That's what Homeland Security is all about.
[02:29:11.362 --> 02:29:13.722]  Here's another article out of the Daily Texan today.
[02:29:14.603 --> 02:29:16.643]  Army agent questions law students.
[02:29:17.495 --> 02:29:25.864]  Army Intelligence dropped by the law school and demanded a list of everyone attending the UT Law School meeting.
[02:29:26.524 --> 02:29:30.669]  And they just said, Army Intelligence, our job is now watching the students.
[02:29:33.892 --> 02:29:34.793]  We're on the march.
[02:29:35.273 --> 02:29:36.895]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:37.816 --> 02:29:40.499]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:43.675 --> 02:29:44.635]  Is America bankrupt?
[02:29:44.795 --> 02:29:47.356]  Are we on the verge of an all-out economic collapse?
[02:29:47.676 --> 02:29:50.136]  What can be done to protect your family and assets?
[02:29:50.376 --> 02:29:53.457]  What kinds of investments will be able to withstand an economic meltdown?
[02:29:53.577 --> 02:29:56.118]  The problem is it's not always easy to find great solutions.
[02:29:56.278 --> 02:29:59.918]  And during these dangerous economic times, finding the right solution is crucial.

[02:31:42.339 --> 02:31:43.119]  Bookmark it today.
[02:31:44.133 --> 02:31:47.076]  We've all heard the ads for lower prices on airfare and hotel.
[02:31:47.437 --> 02:31:49.038]  Oh yeah, the dot-coms are endless.
[02:31:49.218 --> 02:31:54.864]  CheaperHotels.com, SaveOnYourRentalCar.com, HalfPriceAirlineTickets.com.
[02:31:54.924 --> 02:32:00.730]  Problem is, by the time you get done planning your vacation, you've visited dozens of websites and spent hours and hours trying to save money.
[02:32:00.750 --> 02:32:03.273]  Well, I'm glad to tell you there's an easier way to get it all at once.
[02:32:04.754 --> 02:32:05.914]  Not convinced yet?
[02:32:05.995 --> 02:32:10.077]  How about auto repair, health and beauty, financial services or shopping discounts?
[02:32:25.686 --> 02:32:26.306]  We're good to go.
[02:32:26.406 --> 02:32:27.086]  We're good to go.
[02:32:27.126 --> 02:32:27.767]  We're good to go.
[02:32:53.324 --> 02:32:56.805]  You know, I've made three films on the police state.
[02:32:58.005 --> 02:33:06.827]  I've been to the urban warfare training drills where the troops are training with role players that are yelling, I'm an American, oh, please don't put me in the camp, don't take my guns.
[02:33:08.408 --> 02:33:11.588]  But now we have top generals saying this is the next step.
[02:33:11.648 --> 02:33:22.331]  We have Homeland Security minions at ceremonies handing tanks over to police departments and saying this is for your Homeland Security duty.
[02:33:23.147 --> 02:33:27.889]  You know, suppressing dissent, going after crowds.
[02:33:29.030 --> 02:33:29.730]  It's horrible.
[02:33:30.471 --> 02:33:34.853]  What is it the government has planned that's so horrible they know that we're going to physically resist them?
[02:33:35.833 --> 02:33:40.015]  I mean, we've put up with all the other garbage, peacefully, in the past.
[02:33:40.235 --> 02:33:44.197]  What is it they've got planned that they know is so bad we're going to physically resist?
[02:33:45.034 --> 02:33:53.621]  Well, I'll tell you, it's taking your pension funds, it's blowing out the economy, it's superinflation when people realize what's happened to the dollar.
[02:33:54.321 --> 02:34:02.387]  They're gearing up for a massive crackdown, and it's so sad to see this happening and to see the police brainwashed into an us-against-them mentality.
[02:34:04.189 --> 02:34:06.410]  Let's go ahead and talk to Leon in Colorado.
[02:34:06.430 --> 02:34:08.052]  We're getting Greg Palastone right now.
[02:34:08.612 --> 02:34:09.533]  Leon, go ahead.
[02:34:10.514 --> 02:34:12.275]  Yeah, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:34:13.640 --> 02:34:19.682]  I just wanted to ask a question about this guy that was arrested by this state patrolman.
[02:34:20.962 --> 02:34:37.466]  Doesn't he have some, his family or somebody should file some charges of treason against this police, what is he, state policeman and the judge for violating his constitutional rights?
[02:34:38.286 --> 02:34:41.811]  Well, you can certainly get official oppression.
[02:34:41.971 --> 02:34:45.355]  And for those that just joined us, a listener, Kelly Rushing in Fredonia, Kentucky.
[02:34:55.791 --> 02:34:56.431]  We're good to go.
[02:34:56.451 --> 02:34:56.871]  We're good to go.
[02:35:21.620 --> 02:35:32.124]  In Tulia, Texas, on the word of one cop who was being paid as an informant, they all got 20 to 90 years in prison, no drugs, no paraphernalia, and the governor had to pardon them.
[02:35:32.424 --> 02:35:36.986]  This is just the wildness, the out-of-control corruption.
[02:35:37.166 --> 02:35:38.546]  It's madness, is what it is.
[02:35:38.946 --> 02:35:48.770]  It is, and we're going to be getting... The other thing is, you were talking earlier about the Anti-Defamation League...
[02:35:49.429 --> 02:35:56.712]  And also included in all of those is, you know, that Southern Poverty Law guy under Dees or whatever his name is.
[02:35:56.732 --> 02:35:57.472]  Yeah, Morris Dees.
[02:35:57.892 --> 02:36:06.496]  All of those organizations, if you follow the money, they're all funded by the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation.
[02:36:06.796 --> 02:36:10.617]  All of them are a bunch of minions for the globalists.
[02:36:10.977 --> 02:36:11.438]  I hear you.
[02:36:11.478 --> 02:36:12.278]  I've got to let you go.
[02:36:13.478 --> 02:36:14.339]  We've got our guests, sir.
[02:36:14.399 --> 02:36:15.199]  I appreciate it.
[02:36:16.148 --> 02:36:21.593]  Yeah, and they go after left-wing groups, right-wing groups, everybody, and demonize them, and it's wrong.
[02:36:21.833 --> 02:36:24.455]  Joining us is Greg Palast.
[02:36:24.515 --> 02:36:32.101]  He's a Newsnight investigative reporter with the BBC, best-selling New York Times, best-selling author of The Best Democracy Money Can Buy.
[02:36:32.121 --> 02:36:37.125]  I wanted to get him back on to finish up some of the news we were covering a few days ago last week.
[02:36:37.325 --> 02:36:38.406]  Greg, good to have you on the show.
[02:36:38.927 --> 02:36:41.569]  Alex, always a special treat to be with you.
[02:36:43.028 --> 02:36:45.311]  A lot's happening, Greg.
[02:36:45.591 --> 02:36:50.455]  This whole thing about Bush's military records, I mean, the records clearly show that he disappeared.
[02:36:50.956 --> 02:36:53.879]  We have all these witnesses at the Guard saying he was never there.
[02:36:55.060 --> 02:37:04.969]  Then they pull out some Bush minion who was with Bush at the big race car race this weekend, and he says, oh, no, Bush was there.
[02:37:05.590 --> 02:37:06.731]  What's really going on, Greg?
[02:37:08.180 --> 02:37:16.582]  Well, what's really going on is I went down to Texas myself and investigated Bush's war record, or lack thereof, for BBC television.
[02:37:17.662 --> 02:37:19.843]  And I met with officers.
[02:37:19.883 --> 02:37:21.023]  I went to the Air Guard.
[02:37:21.143 --> 02:37:24.504]  And by the way, I've got to tell you, I thought that they were going to give me a big hassle.
[02:37:25.244 --> 02:37:28.965]  I've got to tell you, those Air Guard guys are a little bit peeved off.
[02:37:29.506 --> 02:37:35.107]  They're not so crazy about all these rich kids that were given the top jobs at the Air Guard to get out of Vietnam.
[02:37:36.174 --> 02:37:39.816]  The Texas Air Guard today is on active duty in Iraq and around the world.
[02:37:39.836 --> 02:37:48.822]  Well, it was in the Associated Press just last Friday that in the late 90s, the guard right here at Camp Mabry in Austin was ordered to cover up Bush's records.
[02:37:48.902 --> 02:37:49.562]  That's correct.
[02:37:49.602 --> 02:37:59.929]  And so I went to Camp Mabry, and I met with the Air Guard people in Austin, but I was also able to get a hold of a document from inside the U.S.
[02:37:59.969 --> 02:38:05.232]  Justice Department from a whistleblower who explained exactly who made the call
[02:38:05.871 --> 02:38:16.353]  There was a big-time lobbyist who was not... Lieutenant Governor Ben Barnes was the power in Texas in the 60s during the war.
[02:38:16.933 --> 02:38:26.755]  And while he was a Democrat, he had really good relations with Congressman George Bush Sr., then the head of the Republican Party nationwide.
[02:38:27.615 --> 02:38:32.056]  And he had another lobbyist whom I spoke with.
[02:38:32.697 --> 02:38:40.142]  ...whom I spoke with, whose name, unfortunately, I can't give out, but in front of... He did this on camera, but I'm not allowed to show the camera film.
[02:38:41.082 --> 02:38:55.411]  But this is confirmed by BBC, who said, Yes, I picked up the... I called the Texas Air Guard at the request of Ben Barnes... ...specifically was making the request for...
[02:38:56.621 --> 02:38:57.281]  We're good to go.
[02:39:18.638 --> 02:39:19.318]  Who got the job.
[02:39:19.338 --> 02:39:20.379]  He leaped the line ahead of 75%.
[02:39:22.139 --> 02:39:23.780]  Got the job in the Texas Air Guard.
[02:39:23.820 --> 02:39:25.920]  That got him out of the draft.
[02:39:25.960 --> 02:39:30.022]  He was just days away from being drafted and sent off to NAM.
[02:39:31.062 --> 02:39:32.883]  Now, here's the creepy part of it.
[02:39:33.563 --> 02:39:38.284]  And you can actually see part of this letter that was in the U.S.
[02:39:38.304 --> 02:39:39.945]  Justice Department offices, which was buried.
[02:39:41.225 --> 02:39:42.806]  The creepy part of it is that...
[02:39:44.557 --> 02:39:55.047]  That in order to cover this fact up, during the race for governor of Texas, Bush was running, George W. was running against Ann Richards, who was the incumbent.
[02:39:55.067 --> 02:39:56.088]  It was a tight race.
[02:39:57.369 --> 02:39:59.271]  George's war record came up.
[02:40:00.329 --> 02:40:09.853]  And when this information came through, then this information came through that, in fact, the fix was in to get young Georgie out of the military at his daddy's, his congressman daddy's behest.
[02:40:09.873 --> 02:40:11.473]  And don't forget, George Sr.
[02:40:11.533 --> 02:40:14.434]  voted to send other men's sons to Vietnam, just not his own son.
[02:40:15.114 --> 02:40:17.475]  And so did his grandfather, Prescott, who was a U.S.
[02:40:17.535 --> 02:40:22.637]  Senator, voted to send other men's grandsons to Vietnam, but again, not his own grandson.
[02:40:26.352 --> 02:40:36.977]  At the time, one of the big clients of Ben Barnes was a lottery company, G-Tech, which now owns the Texas State Lottery, earns him about a billion dollars a year, this corporation.
[02:40:38.117 --> 02:40:48.041]  And the word Ben Barnes, someone associated with him, called the governor's office and reminded the governor's office of what Barnes knew about the record.
[02:40:48.721 --> 02:40:50.142]  This is according to the informant.
[02:40:51.222 --> 02:40:55.204]  And suddenly, G-Tech Corporation, which was about to lose, which had been
[02:40:55.825 --> 02:41:00.650]  Removed for corruption from the Texas lottery contract.
[02:41:00.850 --> 02:41:01.691]  Removed for corruption.
[02:41:02.171 --> 02:41:06.035]  Was given the contract back without a bid to run the Texas state lottery.
[02:41:08.337 --> 02:41:08.838]  In other words...
[02:41:10.740 --> 02:41:16.421]  Basically, nothing would be said about young George's war record and how he got out of Vietnam.
[02:41:16.901 --> 02:41:19.322]  A billion-dollar-a-year payoff.
[02:41:19.402 --> 02:41:21.222]  Boy, I tell you, that was a good investment.
[02:41:21.943 --> 02:41:22.603]  It's worth it.
[02:41:23.823 --> 02:41:31.445]  But, you know, you have to understand this story, and then plus the missing days of pay.
[02:41:32.305 --> 02:41:40.187]  As you know, I spoke with a Texas Air Guard lieutenant, a guy named Burkett,
[02:41:41.538 --> 02:41:59.751]  He had been in the office when one of the generals received a call from the governor's office that Karen Hughes was coming in to look at the Texas Air Guard records, and she hoped that there would be nothing embarrassing there.
[02:42:00.512 --> 02:42:08.918]  And basically then he said he'd overheard this and he asked some of the officers, are we saying that we're going to file for the governor?
[02:42:09.508 --> 02:42:09.908]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:42:32.256 --> 02:42:33.456]  Now, why would they cover that up?
[02:42:33.516 --> 02:42:41.338]  As we now know, the pay records are coming out, and there's huge gaps in even a five-month gap in which he wasn't paid.
[02:42:41.618 --> 02:42:46.759]  Well, yesterday they had all the media in there at a press conference and wouldn't let him leave with the documents.
[02:42:46.819 --> 02:42:49.420]  Oh, we've released it, but you can't leave with it.
[02:42:49.820 --> 02:42:53.221]  And then last week the pay stubs they gave out are illegible.
[02:42:53.261 --> 02:42:54.121]  You can't even read them.
[02:42:54.702 --> 02:42:58.104]  Well, there's one other problem, too, is that there's a sloppiness in these pay stubs.
[02:42:58.144 --> 02:43:03.367]  It doesn't say, for example, if there were other days when he was called to drill and didn't show.
[02:43:04.027 --> 02:43:11.151]  Now, according to the people we went to, if that happened, it looks like the evidence is tending that way, that he just didn't show.
[02:43:11.171 --> 02:43:20.996]  A no-show, if you're AWOL, in effect, by not showing up for the drill, the lieutenant that we spoke to said, yeah, he had a couple of other guys who did that.
[02:43:22.296 --> 02:43:23.617]  Bush was not in his unit either.
[02:43:24.048 --> 02:43:26.129]  He said, and the price is pretty severe.
[02:43:26.169 --> 02:43:30.010]  You lost your position in the Air Guard, and it's off to Vietnam to you.
[02:43:30.991 --> 02:43:33.492]  And except, unless I guess you're a congressman's son.
[02:43:34.532 --> 02:43:37.654]  And so, once again, it's an issue of privilege.
[02:43:37.954 --> 02:43:42.436]  I don't want to get, you know, I know my good friend Michael Moore said that Bush had deserted.
[02:43:42.896 --> 02:43:43.976]  It's not desertion.
[02:43:43.996 --> 02:43:50.579]  You're talking about a daddy who's a very powerful congressman, had a Republican Party, misuse of privilege.
[02:43:51.411 --> 02:44:02.061]  And, of course, this terrible business when it starts falling apart where suddenly contracts are given out by the state in a manner that advantages those that are holding this information.
[02:44:02.081 --> 02:44:11.810]  Well, yeah, I mean, Bush on Meet the Press a few weeks ago with Tim Russert says, well, you know, the military gave me my honorable discharge.
[02:44:12.210 --> 02:44:14.412]  They don't just do that unless you've done a good job.
[02:44:14.773 --> 02:44:16.214]  Well, that's not true.
[02:44:17.355 --> 02:44:18.755]  Look, I've got to tell you...
[02:44:41.966 --> 02:44:44.931]  I wasn't the first guy to volunteer for Vietnam myself.
[02:44:45.031 --> 02:44:49.238]  But on the other hand, my daddy didn't vote to send other men's sons to Vietnam.
[02:44:49.298 --> 02:44:52.363]  My grandfather did not vote to send other men's sons to Vietnam.
[02:44:52.683 --> 02:44:54.146]  And my father didn't make a call
[02:44:57.343 --> 02:45:04.425]  Well, it was quoted in the Memphis newspaper out of Alabama last week, and they had a bunch of different witnesses there.
[02:45:05.225 --> 02:45:09.326]  They were told, yeah, some rich kid's coming, and they were all waiting for him to show up.
[02:45:09.366 --> 02:45:11.926]  They said they wanted to party with him, and he never showed up.
[02:45:11.986 --> 02:45:12.826]  He was never there.
[02:45:13.346 --> 02:45:22.408]  Well, if you go to my website, www.gregpalast.com, that's G-R-E-G-P-A-L-A-S-T, I see that I actually have
[02:45:22.955 --> 02:45:31.780]  This document from inside the Justice Department, my staff has loaded it up for the Alex Jones listeners.
[02:45:32.380 --> 02:45:49.649]  If you go to gregpalast.com and you type in Bush and Draft Dodger or you type in Bush and Air Guard, you'll get to an article
[02:45:50.762 --> 02:45:58.307]  Which is, let me see if I can get back to this, sorry, which is called President Top Gun.
[02:45:59.136 --> 02:46:02.398]  And there's a link in it which will get you actually to this Justice Department document.
[02:46:02.758 --> 02:46:07.041]  It's pretty sorrowful stuff, because I'm looking at it right now.
[02:46:07.121 --> 02:46:08.582]  But the media has this.
[02:46:08.742 --> 02:46:21.671]  I mean, the Associated Press, Reuters, other publications have the facts that they're lying, but then by the time it gets to the nightly news, it's, well, there's still questions, and we don't know what the truth is, but we do know what the truth is.
[02:46:22.384 --> 02:46:22.524]  Right.
[02:46:22.564 --> 02:46:24.885]  We do know what the truth is, except for there's one other thing.
[02:46:25.185 --> 02:46:46.114]  What hasn't come out in America, and you have to understand that my report for the BBC has been played all over the world, my film on George Bush dodging the draft, paying off people to cover it up, that this information was put on the nightly news in Britain now seven times in the past year, and I couldn't get it into the United States press for nothing.
[02:46:46.194 --> 02:46:47.234]  This is top of the nightly news.
[02:46:47.254 --> 02:46:50.776]  So you have to understand that we're asking the rest of the world to go to war with us.
[02:46:51.604 --> 02:47:04.091]  And the rest of the world is watching a report on my television show saying, this guy's sending your kids to wherever he's going next, Iraq or whatever, but, you know, he wasn't exactly ready to jump on the bandwagon himself.
[02:47:04.111 --> 02:47:10.694]  He'd rather be kind of pretend Tom Cruise in, you know, saving Houston from a Viet Cong attack.
[02:47:11.134 --> 02:47:13.536]  Now, again, the guy's in the air guard today.
[02:47:13.836 --> 02:47:16.137]  Now, you know, by the way, he hasn't hesitated to send...
[02:47:16.903 --> 02:47:20.544]  Our president to send his own air guard unit, which before was a party unit.
[02:47:20.584 --> 02:47:22.184]  Well, what about this tactic?
[02:47:22.424 --> 02:47:25.625]  Greg, what about this tactic he used in Meet the Press that I think is despicable?
[02:47:26.165 --> 02:47:28.145]  Now, don't you criticize the guard.
[02:47:28.385 --> 02:47:31.286]  He just brought that into it as if that had something to do with it.
[02:47:31.546 --> 02:47:33.226]  No one's criticizing the guard.
[02:47:33.426 --> 02:47:33.866]  Absolutely.
[02:47:33.886 --> 02:47:38.687]  We're talking about his record, and he tries to turn it into, hey, don't you talk bad about the guard.
[02:47:38.947 --> 02:47:42.708]  Yeah, in fact, you have to understand that guard people, when I was in Austin...
[02:47:43.949 --> 02:47:51.315]  We're very upset about this business because they are very proud of the Guard, and they don't like the fact that they were used as a dumping ground for rich kids.
[02:47:52.035 --> 02:47:55.037]  John Connolly's son, the other governor's son, was there.
[02:47:55.398 --> 02:47:57.639]  Lloyd Benson's kid, Senator Lloyd Benson.
[02:47:57.659 --> 02:48:06.186]  Democrats and Republicans, this became a dumping off point for the ultra-rich and the ultra-connected of Texas to get their kids out of Vietnam.
[02:48:06.626 --> 02:48:09.328]  Now, I don't blame anyone for doing that, but please don't send other kids...
[02:48:09.973 --> 02:48:12.834]  Well, don't stand around and then lie about it.
[02:48:12.994 --> 02:48:20.615]  And don't stand around to pretend that you're landing an airplane on an aircraft carrier, which he didn't do, by the way.
[02:48:21.015 --> 02:48:29.037]  And just so you know, no one else was ever given a pilot slot who hadn't actually been a pilot previously in Vietnam.
[02:48:29.077 --> 02:48:33.878]  I just spoke with another pilot who trained the pilots to land on aircraft carriers.
[02:48:34.218 --> 02:48:37.819]  You know that he was in tears when he watched George Bush land on that jet.
[02:48:38.219 --> 02:48:38.679]  He said, you know,
[02:48:39.375 --> 02:48:41.256]  There are guys who died making that landing.
[02:48:41.296 --> 02:48:48.421]  There are guys who died and were shot down over Hanoi after taking off from those jets.
[02:48:48.441 --> 02:48:49.201]  We won't come back.
[02:48:49.241 --> 02:48:51.783]  This is not supposed to be for stunts.
[02:48:51.983 --> 02:48:53.464]  This is not a political cartoon.
[02:48:53.504 --> 02:48:54.805]  It's not a political advertisement.
[02:48:55.245 --> 02:48:57.207]  This is our armed forces.
[02:48:57.907 --> 02:48:59.928]  And this guy was in tears, I've got to tell you.
[02:49:00.309 --> 02:49:05.432]  Greg, we've got all these neocons on the air calling us liars because we're just laying out the facts here.
[02:49:06.115 --> 02:49:14.817]  You know, all I'm trying to do is I'm not trying to disparage, you know, first of all, we don't disparage the guard.
[02:49:14.937 --> 02:49:17.277]  I mean, that's really, that's absurd.
[02:49:17.978 --> 02:49:20.218]  The guard is out there right now in combat.
[02:49:21.498 --> 02:49:30.860]  We're talking about a kid who used his daddy's Rolodex to get himself out of Vietnam and then ran around saying how much everyone ought to go to Vietnam.
[02:49:31.300 --> 02:49:33.961]  He was a big booster of the war when he was a kid at Yale.
[02:49:34.380 --> 02:49:41.623]  You know, don't forget, he got into Yale because his grandfather, he had terrible grades, but his grandfather was on the board of Yale.
[02:49:41.643 --> 02:49:46.706]  What do you think of John Kerry and Bush, I mean, this skull and bones presidency?
[02:49:47.866 --> 02:49:53.269]  Well, you know, it is, let's face it, there's a nice little privileged clique up there.
[02:49:53.889 --> 02:49:55.530]  And at least I'll say one thing for Kerry.
[02:49:55.590 --> 02:50:00.392]  He had the privileges, and his daddy could have made the call to get him out, and he didn't.
[02:50:01.593 --> 02:50:08.901]  You know, there's still a couple of very privileged, rich kids who don't hesitate from using their privileges.
[02:50:08.961 --> 02:50:15.609]  But at least I'll say for Kerry, and again, I'm not endorsing any candidate, and I don't care which of these guys wins.
[02:50:15.869 --> 02:50:17.491]  God knows what we're going to get out of it.
[02:50:17.551 --> 02:50:21.336]  But he didn't have his daddy make the call to get him out.
[02:50:21.855 --> 02:50:33.108]  And also, he didn't run around saying that those who question the misuse of privilege are somehow attacking the patriotism of those who serve.
[02:50:33.688 --> 02:50:35.230]  Yeah, that was really low-handed.
[02:50:35.250 --> 02:50:41.237]  See the documents yourself, www.gregpalace.com Say what?
[02:50:44.142 --> 02:50:45.283]  Let's face facts, shall we?
[02:50:45.483 --> 02:50:51.407]  The only place that bald is beautiful is on cue balls and eagles, yet millions continue to suffer through hair loss needlessly.
[02:50:51.667 --> 02:50:52.488]  Now some good news.
[02:50:52.828 --> 02:51:03.415]  Nissim International has developed the New Hair Biofactor Stimulating System, a product line of ultra-deep cleansing shampoos and hair stimulating extracts designed to maximize the natural growth cycle of your hair.
[02:51:03.656 --> 02:51:05.597]  Nissim New Hair Biofactor Shampoos.
[02:51:05.777 --> 02:51:06.257]  We're good to go.
[02:51:30.145 --> 02:51:30.806]  1-800-65-N-I-S-I-M That's 1-800-656-4746
[02:51:44.073 --> 02:51:47.354]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:51:47.414 --> 02:51:51.575]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:51:51.835 --> 02:51:54.616]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:51:54.816 --> 02:51:57.216]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:51:57.416 --> 02:52:06.059]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:52:06.239 --> 02:52:07.579]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:52:07.779 --> 02:52:11.920]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:52:12.280 --> 02:52:14.001]  of the self-sterilizing filters.
[02:52:14.241 --> 02:52:26.189]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[02:52:26.389 --> 02:52:32.953]  It is so powerful, it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[02:52:33.153 --> 02:52:36.315]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:52:41.078 --> 02:52:42.579]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:52:55.299 --> 02:52:57.381]  This disaster is a new world order.
[02:52:57.481 --> 02:53:00.183]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:53:00.543 --> 02:53:04.766]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:53:04.826 --> 02:53:11.751]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:53:11.891 --> 02:53:13.893]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:53:14.133 --> 02:53:24.616]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:53:24.876 --> 02:53:30.257]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:53:30.757 --> 02:53:33.398]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:53:33.418 --> 02:53:34.158]  You're called toll-free, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:53:34.178 --> 02:53:34.518]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:53:34.538 --> 02:53:35.818]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:53:46.480 --> 02:53:51.483]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[02:53:51.663 --> 02:53:52.843]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:53:53.324 --> 02:53:55.845]  I'm sorry to the folks online, loaded phone lines.
[02:53:55.885 --> 02:53:56.805]  Just call me back tonight.
[02:53:56.825 --> 02:53:57.726]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:53:58.846 --> 02:54:00.447]  And we'll have time to take your calls.
[02:54:01.188 --> 02:54:03.989]  Got a few final issues here we want to go over with Greg Pallas.
[02:54:04.049 --> 02:54:07.371]  Greg, you've got a new CD slash video out.
[02:54:08.450 --> 02:54:11.612]  That goes over a lot of what we've been discussing here on the show.
[02:54:12.472 --> 02:54:13.333]  It's great stuff.
[02:54:14.073 --> 02:54:16.754]  Folks can get a copy of that at gregpalast.com, can't they?
[02:54:17.034 --> 02:54:17.235]  Right.
[02:54:17.315 --> 02:54:22.097]  It's called Weapon of Mass Instruction, Greg Palast, live and uncensored.
[02:54:22.117 --> 02:54:23.938]  It's an enhanced CD.
[02:54:23.998 --> 02:54:30.761]  In other words, you could put in your car stereo and get an hour discussion from me, several tracks.
[02:54:31.021 --> 02:54:32.542]  A lot of it's pretty funny, actually.
[02:54:33.022 --> 02:54:35.964]  The kind of tragic comedy of our national...
[02:54:36.886 --> 02:54:46.512]  Issues, everything from George Bush, War Hero, War Zero, to the bin Laden family and the 199I documents I mentioned.
[02:54:46.892 --> 02:54:59.679]  And if you stick it into a computer, though, it works like a DVD where you can see some of these confidential documents, including the one about George Bush's war record, the FBI secret documents, and other World Bank secret documents.
[02:54:59.720 --> 02:55:01.040]  Very important stuff.
[02:55:01.501 --> 02:55:01.961]  Greg, how...
[02:55:02.781 --> 02:55:09.946]  How can Bush call himself a conservative when the government's grown by 45% while he's doing all these unconservative things?
[02:55:10.306 --> 02:55:11.387]  A very big government.
[02:55:11.447 --> 02:55:23.654]  In fact, what I'm writing now for Rolling Stone magazine is an investigation into basically the use of privatized CIA operations that he's running.
[02:55:24.130 --> 02:55:30.353]  We're creating a new national DNA database, which they say they aren't, but I have the information that they are.
[02:55:30.413 --> 02:55:33.154]  They really are setting up a dictatorship.
[02:55:33.614 --> 02:55:34.494]  And they want you to love it.
[02:55:34.534 --> 02:55:36.615]  They're telling you this will make you more secure.
[02:55:36.895 --> 02:55:49.661]  They tell you, for example, there's a company, Choice Point, that has a program that suggests that you should push the government to require that they get your DNA samples, your kids' DNA samples, in case something terrible happens.
[02:55:51.039 --> 02:55:56.122]  By the way, Greg, when they take your blood at birth, part of that does go for a blood test.
[02:55:56.142 --> 02:55:58.143]  The other ampule goes to the federal government.
[02:55:58.523 --> 02:56:00.224]  I can get you some documentation on that.
[02:56:00.424 --> 02:56:02.645]  They've already got the federal DNA database.
[02:56:02.665 --> 02:56:04.006]  This is what we need to have.
[02:56:04.026 --> 02:56:04.766]  I've got to tell you this.
[02:56:04.886 --> 02:56:11.830]  What I'm looking at now is I've got insiders from this company who are blowing the whistle on this stuff.
[02:56:11.970 --> 02:56:12.550]  They're keeping...
[02:56:13.170 --> 02:56:24.755]  It is against the law, and the law being the United States Constitution, but specific executive orders issued by Bill Clinton and even Richard Nixon, saying that the FBI cannot and CIA cannot keep
[02:56:25.925 --> 02:56:31.628]  Computer files on Americans who are not under suspicion of having caused a crime.
[02:56:31.728 --> 02:56:38.911]  But CAPS 2 legitimizes and institutionalizes that, and these are the type of issues that you report on on a regular basis.
[02:56:39.311 --> 02:56:40.371]  That's right.
[02:56:40.391 --> 02:56:49.235]  And what they're doing is, the way they're getting around this, they're having private companies keep these databases, and they're saying, well, the FBI's not keeping it, Homeland Security's not keeping this stuff.
[02:56:49.716 --> 02:56:50.636]  It's a private company.
[02:56:51.189 --> 02:56:54.131]  And therefore we can then just access their databases.
[02:56:54.351 --> 02:56:55.512]  Well, that's even more dangerous.
[02:56:55.752 --> 02:57:04.699]  Greg, what's happening real quick in the last minute or so here with the Pakistan situation with Bush blocking the investigations of this scientist who's arming all these people?
[02:57:05.039 --> 02:57:18.649]  Well, we've got a big problem here because, as you know, I reported BBC two years ago and now finally coming out here that Pakistan was running a flea market in nuclear fission materials and nuclear bomb plants
[02:57:19.045 --> 02:57:19.485]  We're good to go.
[02:57:40.706 --> 02:57:41.646]  The Bush administration.
[02:57:41.747 --> 02:57:42.327]  Absolutely.
[02:57:42.367 --> 02:57:44.688]  And then if there's more terror attacks, they just get more control.
[02:57:44.988 --> 02:57:46.109]  GregPowles.com.

[02:57:53.452 --> 02:57:55.393]  I might mention that I have made...
[02:57:57.021 --> 02:57:58.902]  10 films and written a book and published a book.

[02:58:05.086 --> 02:58:07.647]  They're waking up 90% of those that see them.
[02:58:08.167 --> 02:58:08.868]  So don't wait.

[02:58:33.917 --> 02:58:37.378]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:58:37.658 --> 02:58:41.160]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:58:41.260 --> 02:58:45.201]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:58:45.421 --> 02:58:51.583]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:58:51.983 --> 02:58:59.886]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:59:00.306 --> 02:59:05.648]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:59:05.808 --> 02:59:09.590]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
