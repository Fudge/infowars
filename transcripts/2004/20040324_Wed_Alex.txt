[00:00:05.487 --> 00:00:06.129]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.892]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.573 --> 00:00:09.715]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.336 --> 00:00:11.158]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:12.680]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.462 --> 00:00:17.423]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.643 --> 00:00:21.764]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.804 --> 00:00:27.625]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:27.705 --> 00:00:31.446]  It is now the 24th day of March 2004.
[00:00:32.606 --> 00:00:39.408]  As we go straight into Gale Force New World Order criminality, as we expose it, as we chronicle it.
[00:00:41.093 --> 00:00:42.914]  It is Wednesday, the 24th of March, 2004.
[00:00:43.494 --> 00:00:45.155]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:45.175 --> 00:00:53.780]  The website's freshly updated, thanks to the great work of my webmasters, prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.864]  We'll be live for the next three hours, and we have an ultra-massive show for you today.
[00:01:00.905 --> 00:01:06.908]  In 30 minutes, I have a district attorney coming on in a major state who says he loves
[00:01:07.558 --> 00:01:11.200]  Making people give blood at checkpoints, and you better get used to it.
[00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:17.883]  Imagine, driving up to a checkpoint, 50 cars are stopped in front of you, every third car is pulled over.
[00:01:19.104 --> 00:01:26.628]  Police officers handcuff you and jab needles into your arm, sucking out your blood.
[00:01:27.068 --> 00:01:32.451]  The Nazis, imagine watching an old movie, ooh, the Nazis on board the train sucking people's blood.
[00:01:34.873 --> 00:01:35.874]  No one would buy that.
[00:01:35.914 --> 00:01:39.516]  I mean, just showing the papers was bad enough, but see how far we've gone?
[00:01:40.457 --> 00:01:50.063]  Every day there's articles that say, headlines, Big Brother helping, Big Brother's a friend, giving up liberties, wonderful, cameras in school bathrooms are good.
[00:01:51.183 --> 00:02:00.169]  I remember three years ago, first getting news stories out of Arizona, Nevada, California, New Mexico, Arizona.
[00:02:01.852 --> 00:02:11.980]  Where they, for some reason out west, I guess, this newest horror is out of Wisconsin, and people, the police put notices, we'll be stopping you at checkpoints, taking your blood.
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.744]  And by the way, they're trying to say, well, if you don't breathe, if you don't blow into the breathalyzer, we do.
[00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:18.104]  Uh-uh.
[00:02:18.865 --> 00:02:21.827]  It's drug testing, and we're trying to find those articles and repost them.
[00:02:22.067 --> 00:02:22.928]  They're in the archives.
[00:02:22.968 --> 00:02:25.690]  We're posting them with this Wall Street Journal article as well.
[00:02:26.664 --> 00:02:27.424]  It's checkpoints.
[00:02:27.744 --> 00:02:28.765]  But don't believe me.
[00:02:28.925 --> 00:02:30.725]  It's going to happen to you.
[00:02:31.245 --> 00:02:36.607]  It's going to happen to your son or daughter, to your mommy or your daddy or your granny.
[00:02:38.047 --> 00:02:43.369]  You're going to get to enjoy men in black uniforms sticking needles in your arm.
[00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.830]  Oh, don't believe me.
[00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.431]  They're going to put thumb scanners in the grocery store to buy and sell.
[00:02:52.011 --> 00:02:53.752]  It's coming to your area right now.
[00:02:55.307 --> 00:02:58.653]  About the illegal aliens, all their fake ID cards are accepted.
[00:02:58.673 --> 00:03:02.299]  They're given bank accounts, given apartments, given more tuition than citizens.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.842]  They can do no wrong.
[00:03:05.223 --> 00:03:07.704]  In push to stop drunk driving, police draw blood.
[00:03:07.724 --> 00:03:09.464]  Hey, let me tell you something about MAD, folks.
[00:03:09.484 --> 00:03:10.825]  They're a front for the government.
[00:03:10.845 --> 00:03:12.685]  It has nothing to do with drunk driving.
[00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:18.887]  It's about a police state setting up automatic toll roads on all highways, automatic checkpoint systems.
[00:03:19.467 --> 00:03:22.108]  They passed the federal laws, the federal funding to do it.
[00:03:22.648 --> 00:03:27.610]  Back in 1998, and it's in my film, Police State 2000, released in early 99.
[00:03:31.621 --> 00:03:34.325]  So that's the reality of what we're dealing with.
[00:03:34.805 --> 00:03:36.607]  Remember the drug testing in the schools.
[00:03:36.668 --> 00:03:47.942]  It was just for if you were in the band or played football, or oh, if you're allowed to leave the campus at lunch, that's a privilege, or if you're allowed to park your car there, or oh, allowed to be in shop, or now it's...
[00:03:49.238 --> 00:03:53.961]  Federal initiative to make even elementary school students be urine or blood tested.
[00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:56.223]  Just getting us used to the government.
[00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:58.464]  Imagine if the Soviet Union took people's blood.
[00:03:58.484 --> 00:04:00.045]  People would go, that's incredible tyranny.
[00:04:00.185 --> 00:04:01.526]  But here it's good.
[00:04:01.626 --> 00:04:03.147]  It's good.
[00:04:04.048 --> 00:04:07.130]  It'll stop the drugs that the dirty government ships in.
[00:04:08.751 --> 00:04:12.693]  And in this article it says, in push to stop drunk driving, police draw blood.
[00:04:12.733 --> 00:04:15.095]  Authorities often must force suspects to give samples.
[00:04:15.395 --> 00:04:16.376]  A dilemma for doctors.
[00:04:17.057 --> 00:04:20.782]  Wall Street Journal, in that sub-headline, Mr. Jones dies fighting.
[00:04:22.304 --> 00:04:23.546]  They kicked his face in.
[00:04:24.006 --> 00:04:29.694]  They tied him down and kicked his face in until his eye actually fell out, caved the whole eye in.
[00:04:29.714 --> 00:04:31.476]  And he died.
[00:04:31.496 --> 00:04:33.859]  And they got their blood.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.084]  Because it's America where we jab needles in your jet points.
[00:04:39.504 --> 00:04:40.345]  Because we're free.
[00:04:40.465 --> 00:04:43.228]  Because we put cameras in the school bathrooms.
[00:04:43.388 --> 00:04:45.230]  Because we're free.
[00:04:45.831 --> 00:04:47.272]  It couldn't happen here.
[00:04:47.913 --> 00:04:49.774]  It did happen here.
[00:04:50.055 --> 00:04:53.358]  And shame on all you sickos in government that think this is freedom.
[00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:55.200]  You're shameful.
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.543]  You're not even Americans, you pieces of worthless trash.
[00:05:01.235 --> 00:05:05.916]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the first ever half-price package sale at the Ark Institute.
[00:05:06.016 --> 00:05:12.897]  You'll get 25 big packets of Ark's most popular non-hybrid heirloom vegetable seeds, plus four of their most popular self-reliance books.
[00:05:13.117 --> 00:05:15.638]  Learn how to grow your own delicious veggies and build your Ark.
[00:05:15.858 --> 00:05:20.999]  Imagine green beans, carrots, peas and cucumbers, tomatoes, cabbage, squash, herbs and more.
[00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:25.219]  Then, harvest your seeds to grow year after year for old-time self-reliance.
[00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:29.260]  In Living Well on Wheat, learn how to cook, eat and survive on the golden grains.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.281]  We're good to go.
[00:06:00.923 --> 00:06:05.251]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:05.431 --> 00:06:09.800]  Police State 3 details the architecture goals and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:12.961 --> 00:06:21.772]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:21.852 --> 00:06:28.781]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:28.921 --> 00:06:30.924]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:31.144 --> 00:06:41.630]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:47.293]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:06:47.773 --> 00:06:50.435]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:51.175]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:51.195 --> 00:06:51.535]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:51.555 --> 00:06:52.836]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.962]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:02.322 --> 00:07:08.068]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:07:08.328 --> 00:07:13.453]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:07:13.794 --> 00:07:23.083]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:07:23.423 --> 00:07:28.408]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:32.713]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:07:32.913 --> 00:07:37.698]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:07:38.058 --> 00:07:43.964]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:07:44.284 --> 00:07:50.507]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:07:50.547 --> 00:07:51.528]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:07:51.608 --> 00:07:52.808]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:08:00.777 --> 00:08:05.803]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.183 --> 00:08:08.506]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:08.846 --> 00:08:19.979]  Throughout history, powerful, ruthless, cunning...
[00:08:22.313 --> 00:08:36.623]  Individuals with no conscience get into power, and they sell the population on being slaves, usually using an outside threat, a threat in many cases that the establishment produces, the effective boogeyman.
[00:08:38.844 --> 00:08:40.085]  And we got a big show.
[00:08:40.245 --> 00:08:48.751]  I mean, Rumsfeld up there lying and turning red-faced before the Whitewash Commission, all the developments on that.
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:58.446]  Incredible police state developments at every level as our society is transformed into something worse than the Soviet Union in our face.
[00:08:58.587 --> 00:09:06.833]  But I want to talk about this first because a caller near the end of the broadcast yesterday called in and he said, Alex, yet again you're right.
[00:09:07.053 --> 00:09:12.196]  The front page of the Wall Street Journal reports how they force people to give blood at checkpoints.
[00:09:12.477 --> 00:09:16.960]  So I got the news article and we posted it on Infowars.com.
[00:09:19.208 --> 00:09:21.809]  And prisonplanet.com.
[00:09:22.489 --> 00:09:26.631]  And it says, in push to stop drunk driving, police draw blood.
[00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:30.333]  Authorities often must force suspects to give samples.
[00:09:30.753 --> 00:09:31.853]  A dilemma for doctors.
[00:09:32.674 --> 00:09:36.596]  Now, we've got dozens of writers for prisonplanet.com, and I know you're out there listening.
[00:09:36.636 --> 00:09:37.536]  I want a bunch of you.
[00:09:38.246 --> 00:09:50.689]  To listen to what I have to say, to check out what I have to say, and then to go take this Wall Street Journal article and dissect it paragraph by paragraph and expose the lies and the evil that's being sold in this article.
[00:09:51.029 --> 00:10:04.393]  I don't know what upsets me more, the checkpoints sucking your blood and this total police state activity, or how they lie in this article, or perhaps the writer Joseph Hallin may just be ignorant, probably is.
[00:10:05.788 --> 00:10:08.829]  But, oh, the police and establishment are lying.
[00:10:09.189 --> 00:10:23.192]  I mean, I've got their postings in the Tucson Citizen and in Colorado newspapers and, again, Arizona, going back three years ago where this Thanksgiving, we better not drink and drive or use drugs and drive.
[00:10:23.212 --> 00:10:26.332]  We're going to have checkpoints randomly taking blood samples.
[00:10:26.992 --> 00:10:28.773]  Randomly taking your blood samples.
[00:10:28.833 --> 00:10:34.774]  And we've had a bunch of guests on the show who were driving home from work, 5 o'clock in the afternoon, get pulled over and
[00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.011]  They say, give us your blood, and they say, no way, man.
[00:10:38.551 --> 00:10:43.072]  And they pull a gun out and put it to their head and say, give us your blood or you're dead.
[00:10:43.092 --> 00:10:44.292]  Okay?
[00:10:44.832 --> 00:10:46.073]  I mean, that's what they let them know.
[00:10:46.093 --> 00:10:48.353]  I mean, it sounds incredible, but it's happening.
[00:10:48.893 --> 00:10:50.654]  Well, here it is, Wall Street Journal.
[00:10:51.934 --> 00:10:54.595]  In push to stop drunk driving, police draw blood.
[00:10:54.655 --> 00:10:57.256]  Authorities often must force suspects to give samples.
[00:10:57.636 --> 00:10:58.716]  A dilemma for doctors.
[00:10:59.156 --> 00:11:02.497]  Sub-headline, Mr. Jones dies fighting.
[00:11:03.743 --> 00:11:04.504]  I'll be clear on that.
[00:11:04.524 --> 00:11:08.046]  The people we've had on, the one individual in particular, said that they didn't say, we're going to kill you.
[00:11:08.066 --> 00:11:13.129]  They said, pulled the gun out, put it to his head, and said, don't resist me, which is, I'll kill you.
[00:11:13.149 --> 00:11:13.490]  That's what it is.
[00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:15.451]  You put a gun to somebody, said, what are you saying?
[00:11:17.132 --> 00:11:18.793]  And they've killed quite a few people.
[00:11:18.813 --> 00:11:22.556]  You know, I said that if they pulled me over and said, we're going to suck your blood, I'd say no.
[00:11:24.528 --> 00:11:25.829]  But they don't care, folks.
[00:11:26.089 --> 00:11:29.592]  And this article also implies that nurses take your blood.
[00:11:30.212 --> 00:11:31.293]  Oh, no!
[00:11:31.433 --> 00:11:40.200]  Maybe in some cases, but again, we have stacks of articles we've posted on this that people couldn't seem to believe that they take the blood at the checkpoint.
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.882]  We even got photos posted.
[00:11:42.782 --> 00:11:46.085]  At least I saw my wife getting ready to post them this morning when she was updating the site.
[00:11:46.825 --> 00:11:54.567]  Where it shows the police and they're jabbing a needle, you know, the needle that's built into the blood container into somebody's arm on the side of the road.
[00:11:57.288 --> 00:12:03.049]  And in one of the articles I read on air years ago, it described how by flashlight they take your blood.
[00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:04.670]  I mean, can you imagine this?
[00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.371]  The oppression, the violation.
[00:12:07.391 --> 00:12:12.152]  But when thousands die from drunk driving, we gotta do something.
[00:12:14.036 --> 00:12:14.917]  We're good to go.
[00:12:30.536 --> 00:12:31.957]  Which now isn't just for airlines.
[00:12:32.017 --> 00:12:39.623]  It'll be for trains and bus drivers and now taxi drivers and food preparers and people that work in agriculture and in any job you're going to have.
[00:12:39.903 --> 00:12:40.783]  This is how it works.
[00:12:41.144 --> 00:12:45.126]  You know, you hear it's a trade deal, NAFTA and GATT, Free Trade Area of the Americas.
[00:12:45.167 --> 00:12:48.429]  Well, the actual documents say it's the Pan-American Union.
[00:12:48.929 --> 00:12:51.691]  So you hear, oh, it's an initiative to stop drunk drivers.
[00:12:52.011 --> 00:12:52.492]  No, it's not.
[00:12:52.532 --> 00:12:54.893]  It's internal checkpoints where they suck your blood.
[00:12:55.374 --> 00:12:59.837]  Again, they just give it nice names, nice excuses why they're doing it.
[00:13:01.901 --> 00:13:02.481]  Unbelievable.
[00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:06.263]  And in push to stop drunk driving, police draw blood.
[00:13:07.483 --> 00:13:09.424]  Authorities often must... They're the authorities.
[00:13:09.464 --> 00:13:10.304]  They're not the servants.
[00:13:10.344 --> 00:13:12.365]  They're the authorities, the officials.
[00:13:12.665 --> 00:13:15.165]  Authorities often must force suspects to give samples.
[00:13:15.486 --> 00:13:16.526]  A dilemma for doctors.
[00:13:17.669 --> 00:13:19.710]  And it says, Brookfield, Wisconsin.
[00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:26.432]  And it starts out with an excuse of, oh, see, this guy was drunk and we forced him to give blood, so see, all of you are guilty too now.
[00:13:26.792 --> 00:13:27.012]  See?
[00:13:27.592 --> 00:13:29.513]  Oh, the UN is going to try this guy.
[00:13:29.553 --> 00:13:30.413]  He's a Nazi.
[00:13:30.473 --> 00:13:32.034]  They extra-guided him for what he wrote.
[00:13:32.454 --> 00:13:34.835]  Oh, well, he's a Nazi, then I don't support the First Amendment.
[00:13:35.055 --> 00:13:38.876]  Then it's your First Amendment that gets shut down when you're out protesting George Bush.
[00:13:39.562 --> 00:13:47.989]  Which the federal courts have now ruled, you can have 500 pro-Bush supporters on a public street, you have an anti-Bush sign, you get arrested and federally charged as a terrorist.
[00:13:48.589 --> 00:13:49.990]  That's been in the Washington Times.
[00:13:50.691 --> 00:13:52.472]  You see my examples here of how this works?
[00:13:52.993 --> 00:14:05.503]  But the article goes on, and it says, flipping back into it, it's a long article, it says, Guard Dan Lee Kresge testified that physical resistance to blood draws was a nightly event.
[00:14:06.542 --> 00:14:15.450]  Guards would use whatever force is necessary, he testified, typically handcuffing defendants' arms behind their back, bending them over an examination table in the jail's nurse office.
[00:14:16.591 --> 00:14:18.013]  Again, they do this on the side of the highway, folks.
[00:14:18.353 --> 00:14:19.354]  And holding them down.
[00:14:19.454 --> 00:14:21.896]  Sometimes drivers were held on the floor.
[00:14:21.956 --> 00:14:24.939]  We always got our blood, quote, he testified.
[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:31.045]  Mr. Jones, 270 pounds, tossed several officers off his back with a buck of his head.
[00:14:32.153 --> 00:14:36.174]  Two officers testified that another stood on and kicked Mr. Jones' head.
[00:14:36.214 --> 00:14:39.335]  The officer denied the charge, but I guess the other officers lied then.
[00:14:39.815 --> 00:14:41.436]  Suddenly, Mr. Jones went limp.
[00:14:41.856 --> 00:14:54.860]  The coroner ruled that Mr. Jones died of acute cardiac arrhythmia, a heart rhythm disturbance, but a second autopsy performed by a retired deputy medical examiner at the request of Mr. Jones' widow found that his head had been beaten and his left eye crushed.
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:15:00.042]  Quote, had it not been for the trauma, he probably would not have died, the doctor testified.
[00:15:01.053 --> 00:15:02.874]  And by the way, we've made the calls, we've talked to the people.
[00:15:03.214 --> 00:15:05.814]  This guy's eyeball was hanging out of his head.
[00:15:06.275 --> 00:15:07.795]  They kicked his head in.
[00:15:07.815 --> 00:15:15.537]  And then the government medical examiner said, no, he had a boo-boo with his heart.
[00:15:16.418 --> 00:15:20.239]  And the retired medical examiner said, no, that killed him.
[00:15:20.259 --> 00:15:20.299]  So...
[00:15:22.466 --> 00:15:23.347]  This is the point.
[00:15:23.647 --> 00:15:26.510]  Well, we've got to stop the drunk drivers.
[00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:27.371]  No one.
[00:15:27.931 --> 00:15:33.276]  We've got to stop crime in schools, so let's put cameras in the showers for the middle schoolers, which they're doing.
[00:15:33.877 --> 00:15:35.719]  I mean, again, that's not freedom.
[00:15:35.759 --> 00:15:37.200]  Cameras in the bathrooms.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.161]  I keep repeating this every day.
[00:15:38.181 --> 00:15:39.262]  That's not freedom.
[00:15:39.282 --> 00:15:43.506]  Do I have to explain how a camera in the toilet isn't freedom?
[00:15:45.648 --> 00:15:47.590]  Oh, from Canada to Tennessee it's going in.
[00:15:48.467 --> 00:15:50.928]  And the article just goes on and on.
[00:15:51.448 --> 00:15:56.349]  It is 90% positive, glowing report about get ready for it.
[00:15:56.489 --> 00:15:58.310]  And I'm sure we'll get calls today.
[00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.351]  Every time I talk about this, we get calls.
[00:16:01.291 --> 00:16:07.273]  I've probably read 40 articles on this from around the country, mainly in New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, California.
[00:16:07.313 --> 00:16:09.313]  This big story is out of Wisconsin.
[00:16:12.554 --> 00:16:15.455]  And we've got a guest coming on who's in this article here in about 15 minutes.
[00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:16.576]  You don't want to miss this.
[00:16:17.016 --> 00:16:17.176]  But
[00:16:19.355 --> 00:16:21.496]  I mean, do I even have words to describe how bad this is?
[00:16:21.576 --> 00:16:32.698]  Again, ten years ago they said, we've got to stop the scourge of drugs, not the Ritalin and Prozac and Lithium you put the children on, ten million of them, that's much more toxic than even methamphetamine.
[00:16:33.058 --> 00:16:37.840]  No, no, no, no, not the legal stuff you're pushing actively as the teachers acting as doctors.
[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.260]  No, no, I don't mean that.
[00:16:39.952 --> 00:16:44.714]  No, I mean the illegal drugs that you're so worried about.
[00:16:44.814 --> 00:16:50.877]  We've got these immoral drugs, which you ship in, you trash, you government filth.
[00:16:53.238 --> 00:17:00.721]  Started out, again, with the ban, the football, want to park your car at the school, want any type of extracurricular, any type of privilege, but you've got to do this.
[00:17:01.601 --> 00:17:03.782]  Well, now, guess what's happened?
[00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:14.773]  Well, now, all over the country, federally mandated, federally funded, urine, blood, or other tissue sample, they take them on a monthly basis.
[00:17:14.793 --> 00:17:16.013]  You all line up.
[00:17:16.833 --> 00:17:18.394]  And that's what's happening at these checkpoints.
[00:17:18.494 --> 00:17:20.215]  It's just total tyranny.
[00:17:20.535 --> 00:17:22.416]  Drug testing all students isn't freedom.
[00:17:22.996 --> 00:17:24.917]  Cameras in the bathrooms at the schools isn't freedom.
[00:17:25.197 --> 00:17:28.018]  Thumb scanning them, no cash allowed to get school lunches isn't freedom.
[00:17:28.718 --> 00:17:31.359]  Police wearing black ski masks and skull patches isn't freedom.
[00:17:32.794 --> 00:17:33.134]  Okay?
[00:17:33.534 --> 00:17:35.596]  None of this is freedom, people.
[00:17:35.736 --> 00:17:37.257]  And it gets much worse.
[00:17:37.477 --> 00:17:41.559]  There's a major article admitting that Homeland Security is controlling Hollywood.
[00:17:42.079 --> 00:17:46.202]  You know, about the $70 million fake newscasts that are running that Lord Bush paid for.
[00:17:46.222 --> 00:17:48.143]  I mean, I've been warning you about this forever.
[00:17:48.183 --> 00:17:51.505]  We are in a Twilight Zone situation here.
[00:17:51.525 --> 00:17:55.627]  It is very, very serious.
[00:17:57.955 --> 00:17:59.156]  There's some good news, though.
[00:17:59.617 --> 00:18:14.211]  On C-SPAN.org this morning, early this morning at 6 o'clock, before I went on the radio in Rochester as a guest on the show, I was watching part of Rumsfeld's testimony where he breaks up and has to admit a bunch of stuff, and we'll get into that later.
[00:18:14.231 --> 00:18:19.897]  And on the main page of C-SPAN.org, it says, Most Watched Videos.
[00:18:20.808 --> 00:18:24.772]  And it's been the most watched video now for coming up on two weeks since it was posted.
[00:18:24.892 --> 00:18:26.253]  I've never seen that happen before.
[00:18:26.774 --> 00:18:41.407]  Below it is a NASA briefing on Mars mission, President Bush's remarks on first anniversary of start of Iraq war, Bush-Cheney campaign, manager Ken Malum, former dean campaign director Joe Tripp.
[00:18:42.728 --> 00:18:43.569]  That's all there.
[00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:46.670]  Major political announcements, major speeches.
[00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:51.871]  Do you know what, for almost two weeks, has been the number one watched video and story on C-SPAN.org?
[00:18:51.891 --> 00:18:53.652]  Yeah, and you guess.
[00:18:53.692 --> 00:18:54.532]  It's not the president.
[00:18:54.572 --> 00:18:55.452]  It's not NASA.
[00:18:56.832 --> 00:19:01.333]  Michael Barku, author of A Culture of Conspiracy from Washington Journal.
[00:19:01.353 --> 00:19:06.134]  That's the show they spent the morning after I was on Coast to Coast AM attacking me.
[00:19:07.414 --> 00:19:08.474]  And I've called C-SPAN.
[00:19:08.494 --> 00:19:09.934]  They're not going to have me on, they said.
[00:19:09.954 --> 00:19:12.835]  They're just going to sit there and let people attack me, basically.
[00:19:13.741 --> 00:19:15.843]  And we're going to try to get Brian Lamb on this show.
[00:19:15.863 --> 00:19:16.764]  I'll be polite to him.
[00:19:17.685 --> 00:19:26.834]  And I'm going to try to get Michael Barkun, the Saruman of propaganda for the globalists, we're going to try to have him on the show.
[00:19:26.854 --> 00:19:29.456]  If they won't have me on, I'll go there.
[00:19:30.217 --> 00:19:33.020]  Brian Lamb, I don't know, I've got 20 tapes at least of him talking about me.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.083]  It's endless, but they spent almost the whole hour talking about me.
[00:19:36.895 --> 00:19:38.156]  And it doesn't seem like it's going to stop.
[00:19:38.196 --> 00:19:40.018]  And they just said, no, we're not going to have you on.
[00:19:40.058 --> 00:19:42.680]  So they said, well, we're covering politics right now.
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:43.300]  Oh, really?
[00:19:43.321 --> 00:19:45.302]  You just have this guy on talking about me for an hour.
[00:19:45.342 --> 00:19:46.283]  His book's about me.
[00:19:47.144 --> 00:19:50.446]  And that's the second time they've had an author on about me.
[00:19:50.506 --> 00:19:54.089]  And the point is, though, it's the number one thing on there.
[00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:56.031]  We outnumber these people.
[00:19:56.151 --> 00:19:57.192]  We're winning.
[00:19:57.592 --> 00:19:58.593]  You hear that, criminals?
[00:19:58.913 --> 00:19:59.334]  We're winning.
[00:20:01.175 --> 00:20:09.801]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:20:10.022 --> 00:20:21.290]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:24.112]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:20:24.492 --> 00:20:30.959]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:20:31.119 --> 00:20:32.981]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:20:33.181 --> 00:20:39.207]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:20:39.467 --> 00:20:45.133]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:49.376]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:20:49.396 --> 00:20:50.097]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:20:50.117 --> 00:20:50.817]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:02.173 --> 00:21:04.235]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[00:21:04.395 --> 00:21:06.056]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot.
[00:21:06.176 --> 00:21:14.163]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[00:21:14.403 --> 00:21:20.849]  Imagine hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini, followed by peaches, mixed fruit, or pineapple for dessert.
[00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:22.270]  Just a few of the many selections.
[00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:25.893]  Visit www.longlifefood.com for a complete menu.
[00:21:25.993 --> 00:21:29.556]  Both FEMA and the Red Cross have suggested having food stored in case of disasters.
[00:21:29.776 --> 00:21:35.298]  The Long Life Food Depot was recently mentioned in the USA Today article on the very subject of emergency preparations.
[00:21:35.578 --> 00:21:38.320]  It makes sense to be prepared, and Long Life Food Depot makes it easy.
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:42.521]  Long-term storable MREs make for convenience when camping, hiking, or canoeing.
[00:21:42.741 --> 00:21:44.762]  No fires allowed, hot meals still are.
[00:21:44.902 --> 00:21:47.163]  Call the Long Life Food Depot toll-free at 800-601-2833.
[00:21:47.203 --> 00:21:48.444]  That's 1-800-601-2833, or visit longlifefood.com.
[00:21:54.346 --> 00:21:57.697]  The Long Life Food Depot offers free shipping via UPS ground on every order.
[00:21:57.797 --> 00:21:58.219]  Don't wait.

[00:22:01.038 --> 00:22:02.018]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:02.098 --> 00:22:06.881]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:22:07.041 --> 00:22:14.864]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:22:15.124 --> 00:22:20.487]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:22:20.687 --> 00:22:27.690]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:28.030]  I think.
[00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:54.791]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:56.072 --> 00:22:57.393]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:57.453 --> 00:23:03.817]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[00:23:03.837 --> 00:23:05.459]  I've tried many, many products.
[00:23:05.619 --> 00:23:07.960]  I have never experienced anything like college naked.
[00:23:08.361 --> 00:23:12.183]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than eight weeks.
[00:23:12.603 --> 00:23:13.304]  It truly works.
[00:23:13.686 --> 00:23:14.867]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[00:23:15.267 --> 00:23:21.211]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:23:21.311 --> 00:23:27.434]  Vim and Vigor's collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism, and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[00:23:27.774 --> 00:23:31.757]  Our listeners keep telling us Vim and Vigor's collagenate really does work.
[00:23:32.197 --> 00:23:33.218]  It's healthy for you, too.
[00:23:33.598 --> 00:23:41.123]  In addition to helping you lose weight, Collagenate is also designed to improve strength and health of muscles, joints, skin, hair, and nails.
[00:23:41.523 --> 00:23:43.745]  So take Collagenate and rejuvenate.
[00:23:43.805 --> 00:23:44.886]  Call Vim and Vigor today.
[00:23:44.906 --> 00:23:45.166]  1-800-622-THIN.
[00:23:45.226 --> 00:23:45.446]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:23:45.546 --> 00:23:47.928]  And listen, get $25 off a three-month supply of Collagenate.
[00:23:47.948 --> 00:23:48.428]  So call now.
[00:23:48.448 --> 00:23:48.648]  1-800-622-THIN.
[00:23:48.668 --> 00:23:48.848]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[00:24:07.349 --> 00:24:12.290]  The globalists can tell their lies, put out their spin, the people don't trust them, they see through it.
[00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:30.454]  There's a massive awakening taking place, and to have the hour-long bash piece against me that was on C-SPAN on the 12th of this month still be the number one story, and in its most watched video, number one story, above NASA briefing on Mars mission,
[00:24:31.414 --> 00:24:43.146]  On the 18th, President Bush's remarks on first anniversary of start of Iraq war, Bush-Cheney campaign, managers on television, C-SPAN rebroadcast their first televised session of the House of Representatives from 1979.
[00:24:43.187 --> 00:24:43.787]  All of that rates under.
[00:24:47.995 --> 00:24:50.556]  And people that have watched it just on the Internet.
[00:24:50.856 --> 00:24:52.496]  Again, we have the power.
[00:24:52.896 --> 00:24:53.936]  We have to start using it.
[00:24:54.296 --> 00:24:55.837]  But we call up Lamb's office.
[00:24:55.877 --> 00:24:56.457]  We're real nice.
[00:24:56.477 --> 00:24:58.237]  We go, you know, he talks about us all the time.
[00:24:58.257 --> 00:25:03.298]  We'd like to come on, talk about the so-called culture of conspiracy, give some answers.
[00:25:03.358 --> 00:25:05.518]  And Lamb's talked about me so many times and other guests on.
[00:25:06.139 --> 00:25:08.859]  I just said, no, no, that's not a topic we do.
[00:25:08.899 --> 00:25:12.940]  You just have this professor up there with no facts just spewing propaganda.
[00:25:14.508 --> 00:25:24.050]  But coming up here in just a few minutes, we're going to have District Attorney John O'Boyle on the show.
[00:25:25.137 --> 00:25:31.704]  And Mr. O'Boyle will be coming on the show here in just a few minutes to talk about how he's, quote, really pushed it.
[00:25:32.084 --> 00:25:36.088]  That is blood testing to stop the evil drunk drivers.
[00:25:36.188 --> 00:25:44.076]  And just so when you and your family pull up to a checkpoint and they've got the needles ready, see, it starts out with just those we think are drunk, and then now, oh, we're randomly testing for drugs.
[00:25:44.096 --> 00:25:46.158]  They've been doing that for three years that I know of.
[00:25:46.258 --> 00:25:49.081]  That probably means it's been going on for five years, but we know three years.
[00:25:49.853 --> 00:25:53.896]  But we'll talk to the old district attorney coming up here.
[00:25:53.936 --> 00:25:55.897]  That should be quite interesting.
[00:25:56.537 --> 00:25:57.378]  Then U.S.
[00:25:57.458 --> 00:25:59.459]  gas prices at all-time high.
[00:26:01.361 --> 00:26:06.344]  The president's boy in Congress testified yesterday, Spencer Abraham, and said, Hey, we don't care.
[00:26:06.364 --> 00:26:07.505]  We're not going to try to lower it.
[00:26:07.525 --> 00:26:09.086]  We're not going to go on the strategic reserves.
[00:26:09.126 --> 00:26:10.907]  We're not going to ask the Arabs to cut prices.
[00:26:11.367 --> 00:26:12.828]  It's not the Arabs to begin with.
[00:26:12.888 --> 00:26:14.089]  It's just the way it is.
[00:26:14.761 --> 00:26:15.502]  Just get used to it.
[00:26:15.542 --> 00:26:16.723]  Hey, the borders are wide open.
[00:26:16.983 --> 00:26:17.583]  Get used to it.
[00:26:17.804 --> 00:26:20.146]  Hey, Bush is going to sign you a Sullivan's ban in a few months.
[00:26:20.426 --> 00:26:21.146]  Get used to it.
[00:26:22.247 --> 00:26:26.451]  Just get used to it, and the neocons are going to get out there and lie for them.
[00:26:27.091 --> 00:26:27.732]  Also, U.S.
[00:26:27.752 --> 00:26:33.597]  says FTAA January 2005 deadline is still on course to bring us into the Pan-American Union.
[00:26:34.309 --> 00:26:37.470]  And they accelerate your job losses seven times what they already are, they admit.
[00:26:37.691 --> 00:26:38.651]  That's a good thing, they say.
[00:26:38.711 --> 00:26:40.592]  Exporting jobs is good.
[00:26:40.632 --> 00:26:46.154]  And fast food jobs are now manufacturing and is a durable, good product.
[00:26:47.315 --> 00:26:48.015]  Big Mac star.
[00:26:48.475 --> 00:26:50.656]  So, again, don't listen to us.
[00:26:50.696 --> 00:26:51.396]  Believe them.
[00:26:51.557 --> 00:26:52.237]  Things are great.
[00:26:52.957 --> 00:26:56.499]  Russian nuclear warship ready to blow up, says their top admirals.
[00:26:56.519 --> 00:26:59.320]  They're trying to get it back into port before it explodes in a nuclear explosion.
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:01.961]  That's the mainstream headline here out of the register.
[00:27:02.541 --> 00:27:05.823]  A 9-11 Nordat issue addressed in Rumsfeld testimony.
[00:27:07.504 --> 00:27:12.707]  He confessed that planes are supposed to be sent up to intercept and hijack planes, but for an hour and 25 minutes they weren't.
[00:27:13.107 --> 00:27:14.848]  He turned red and began stuttering.
[00:27:15.688 --> 00:27:18.590]  Also, a blistering criticism of pre-9-11 readiness.
[00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:22.052]  President Stapp was warned of imminent terrorism, the panel says.
[00:27:22.812 --> 00:27:28.595]  The panel is a complete whitewash, making you think they're doing something and bringing up no real issues.
[00:27:30.629 --> 00:27:32.070]  I was watching Tenet this morning.
[00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:35.193]  I mean, again, he's ready for the Sopranos.
[00:27:35.233 --> 00:27:39.936]  He's a perfect mobster archetype, just up there arrogantly banging his fist.
[00:27:40.637 --> 00:27:43.199]  I don't know about you out there, but I have a little bit of discernment.
[00:27:43.239 --> 00:27:54.368]  I know the body language of congenital liars and Sandy Berger and Tenet and Powell and Albright and Rumsfeld.
[00:27:54.428 --> 00:27:56.250]  I mean, liars, liars, liars.
[00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:57.511]  But not just their body language.
[00:27:57.611 --> 00:27:59.012]  I know they're liars from the facts.
[00:27:59.676 --> 00:28:03.738]  They were all talking about how the FBI could never get documents or whereabouts or info on bin Laden.
[00:28:03.758 --> 00:28:04.758]  They could never arrest him.
[00:28:05.158 --> 00:28:15.323]  When we know all these countries offered to turn him over, when we know they offered all these files and they said, no, we don't want it here, we'll bomb you with cruise missiles, don't offer to hand over our CIA officer again.
[00:28:16.522 --> 00:28:17.563]  I mean, just every point.
[00:28:17.603 --> 00:28:21.485]  How do you describe every molecule of H2O in the sea?
[00:28:21.926 --> 00:28:29.891]  How do you track every word, an embellishment, a lie, a twisting, a fabrication, a bamboozlement?
[00:28:30.892 --> 00:28:33.473]  It's just overwhelming.
[00:28:33.614 --> 00:28:37.556]  I just sit there watching an hour of this, preparing to vomit.
[00:28:39.317 --> 00:28:43.020]  People are watching all this smoke they're throwing at trying to confuse people.
[00:28:43.999 --> 00:28:46.560]  So we'll get into the whole 9-11 Commission as well.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.521]  And as I said, there's so much Big Brother news.
[00:28:50.421 --> 00:28:54.223]  It is just absolutely legion here.
[00:28:54.643 --> 00:28:57.264]  So you do not want to miss that as well.
[00:28:57.524 --> 00:28:59.905]  Here's a headline, Chicago Sun-Times coming up.
[00:29:00.325 --> 00:29:03.526]  Homeland Security Liaison to Keep Hollywood in Line.
[00:29:04.953 --> 00:29:05.654]  Ah, Homeland Security.
[00:29:05.694 --> 00:29:06.495]  Keep Hollywood in line.
[00:29:07.035 --> 00:29:08.756]  Government will track ID card use.
[00:29:08.776 --> 00:29:10.938]  They admit your national ID card that's your driver's license.
[00:29:11.218 --> 00:29:13.440]  We'll track everything you buy and sell and do, as we told you.
[00:29:14.221 --> 00:29:15.081]  That's London Guardian.
[00:29:15.602 --> 00:29:18.985]  NEC demos Big Brother biometric phone booth.
[00:29:19.025 --> 00:29:20.526]  Got a thumb scan to use the phone booth.
[00:29:20.546 --> 00:29:23.008]  They already try to make you put in an ID card number, most of them.
[00:29:24.329 --> 00:29:28.331]  High school students offered rewards to stop crime in the Soviet Union, but I guess that's good.
[00:29:28.791 --> 00:29:30.492]  Cameras to guard new city parks.
[00:29:30.512 --> 00:29:33.133]  It says the new patron of the park is Big Brother.
[00:29:33.153 --> 00:29:34.073]  Big Brother's good now.
[00:29:34.133 --> 00:29:35.013]  Every day I see articles.
[00:29:35.894 --> 00:29:37.274]  People are saying Big Brother's good now.
[00:29:37.334 --> 00:29:39.695]  See, Big Brother, we're learning he's actually nice.
[00:29:39.855 --> 00:29:44.217]  We'll all love him like Winston at the end of 1984 with a tear down our cheek.
[00:29:44.397 --> 00:29:46.278]  Oh, Big Brother, I love you.
[00:29:46.658 --> 00:29:48.159]  We'll be right back and talk to Big Brother.
[00:29:51.272 --> 00:29:52.173]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.673 --> 00:29:54.274]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.195 --> 00:29:57.897]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.562 --> 00:30:03.924]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:30:04.164 --> 00:30:08.008]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:30:08.328 --> 00:30:09.149]  Read the labels.
[00:30:09.589 --> 00:30:13.713]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:30:13.933 --> 00:30:18.116]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:30:18.497 --> 00:30:23.361]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:30:23.741 --> 00:30:27.303]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:30:27.504 --> 00:30:32.847]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:30:33.127 --> 00:30:35.849]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:37.050]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:48.097]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[00:31:00.862 --> 00:31:02.823]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[00:31:02.903 --> 00:31:03.563]  Hello, folks.
[00:31:03.703 --> 00:31:13.627]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.007 --> 00:31:18.529]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:18.589 --> 00:31:29.913]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul tastes and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:30.513 --> 00:31:37.378]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:37.758 --> 00:31:39.899]  Your purified water is now ready.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:45.363]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[00:31:45.663 --> 00:31:51.972]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.052 --> 00:31:56.238]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:31:56.479 --> 00:31:57.280]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:00.965 --> 00:32:03.707]  Do you know there's a price war in the insurance business?
[00:32:03.767 --> 00:32:05.467]  Well, right now, don't wait.
[00:32:05.527 --> 00:32:11.070]  You call Term Busters, and you could save up to 40% on quality term life insurance.
[00:32:11.231 --> 00:32:12.191]  Call now.

[00:32:12.271 --> 00:32:12.411]  800-430-6748.
[00:32:12.491 --> 00:32:13.212]  Here's one example.
[00:32:13.232 --> 00:32:16.613]  A male age 50, non-tobacco, issue preferred, half million dollars of coverage is only $113 a month.
[00:32:27.419 --> 00:32:29.460]  Guaranteed for 20 years.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:34.563]  Call Term Busters to save up to 40% on term life insurance.
[00:32:34.583 --> 00:32:36.484]  800-430-6748.
[00:32:36.504 --> 00:32:39.346]  800-430-6748.
[00:32:39.846 --> 00:32:41.427]  We have smokers rates too.
[00:32:41.707 --> 00:32:45.970]  We specialize in half million dollar and up term life insurance coverage.
[00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:51.993]  Call my friends at Term Busters now to see if you can save up to 40% on term life insurance.
[00:32:52.073 --> 00:32:56.956]  800-430-6748 800-430-6748 800-430-6748 Alright, blasting out from Los Angeles, California on the AM and FM dial to Providence, Rhode Island from Austin, Texas.
[00:33:20.487 --> 00:33:24.091]  Simulcasting at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:33:24.111 --> 00:33:24.812]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:33:25.373 --> 00:33:30.699]  Again, about three years ago, I started reading reports about police checkpoints in Arizona, Nevada, Colorado.
[00:33:31.934 --> 00:33:36.155]  Where the police would just randomly take blood, or they thought you might be drinking and driving, they'd take blood.
[00:33:36.775 --> 00:33:41.496]  But in some of the articles it said we're just going to be out taking tissue samples to see if you're on drugs.
[00:33:41.576 --> 00:33:44.636]  People couldn't believe it as we posted the mainstream news articles.
[00:33:45.036 --> 00:33:51.498]  Well, here's an article out of the Wall Street Journal, and it's posted on the websites Infowars.com and PrisonPlanta.com right now.
[00:33:52.358 --> 00:33:56.919]  And it says that, oh, we take them down, we hold them down, we force them, we get the blood.
[00:33:56.959 --> 00:33:58.799]  And it was the case of Mr. Jones.
[00:34:00.048 --> 00:34:06.854]  Out in Nevada, Mr. Jones, 270 pounds, tossed several officers off his back with a buck of his head.
[00:34:06.874 --> 00:34:09.756]  Two officers testified that another stood on him and kicked him.
[00:34:10.316 --> 00:34:13.859]  Mr. Jones' head, the officer denied the charge, despite the other officer's testimony.
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.541]  Suddenly, Mr. Jones went limp.
[00:34:15.581 --> 00:34:18.303]  The coroner ruled Mr. Jones died of an acute cardiac arrhythmia.
[00:34:18.943 --> 00:34:31.207]  A heart rhythm disturbance, but a second autopsy performed by a retired deputy medical examiner, the request of Mrs. Jones' widow, found that his head had been beaten and his left eye crushed.
[00:34:31.988 --> 00:34:35.329]  Had it not been for the trauma, he probably would not have died, the doctor testified.
[00:34:36.989 --> 00:34:41.430]  And it said, last March, a jury ruled the police and jail officials weren't responsible.
[00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:51.252]  Paul Martin, the jail's chief, says it now uses a specially made chair with Velcro straps to restrain drivers brought in for forced blood draws.
[00:34:52.012 --> 00:35:01.134]  Joining us is a district attorney from a different area of the country, John O'Boyle, district attorney of Pierce County, Wisconsin.
[00:35:02.171 --> 00:35:04.132]  And we're honored to have him on the show.
[00:35:04.172 --> 00:35:06.394]  He says that I've really pushed it.
[00:35:06.494 --> 00:35:07.515]  He believes in it.
[00:35:08.115 --> 00:35:11.357]  And he says blood tests tend to be pretty bulletproof, close quote.
[00:35:12.658 --> 00:35:13.939]  Sir, it's good to have you on the show.
[00:35:13.959 --> 00:35:15.100]  Thank you.
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:17.741]  So you're a big fan of this.
[00:35:17.781 --> 00:35:19.823]  When did the blood drawing start?
[00:35:20.143 --> 00:35:26.407]  Well, I'm a big fan of having officers obtain and do blood tests as their primary test under our law.
[00:35:27.369 --> 00:35:36.192]  When they arrest somebody for an OWI, they have a choice between either having the person submit to a breath test, a urine test, or a blood test.
[00:35:36.612 --> 00:35:41.354]  And I've advocated for them to always use the blood test because it's the best result.
[00:35:41.394 --> 00:35:42.394]  Now, let's make that clear.
[00:35:42.734 --> 00:35:48.677]  In the stacks of mainstream news articles I have, and I've mainly seen this out west, they don't give you a choice.
[00:35:48.737 --> 00:35:51.037]  They say, we're taking your blood on the side of the road.
[00:35:51.057 --> 00:35:51.718]  Were you aware of that?
[00:35:52.478 --> 00:35:52.958]  No, I'm not.
[00:35:53.018 --> 00:35:54.398]  We don't do that in Wisconsin.
[00:35:55.459 --> 00:35:55.579]  No.
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:10.503]  Our law in Wisconsin allows the officer to, once the person is placed under arrest, to choose one of the three tests, either breath, urine, or blood, but only after they've been placed under arrest.
[00:36:11.337 --> 00:36:12.678]  Not on the scene of the road, no.
[00:36:13.158 --> 00:36:16.239]  Now, have you heard about the checkpoints they run where they take the blood?
[00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:18.761]  No, I'm not aware of that.
[00:36:18.781 --> 00:36:20.581]  We don't do that up here either.
[00:36:20.721 --> 00:36:25.584]  Well, I mean, they started the drug testing of just some people in public schools, and now it's everybody.
[00:36:25.604 --> 00:36:29.366]  We can see this certainly probably growing in states that have started it.
[00:36:29.826 --> 00:36:31.467]  How long ago did Wisconsin start this?
[00:36:32.187 --> 00:36:34.128]  Start doing what?
[00:36:34.408 --> 00:36:35.148]  The blood testing.
[00:36:35.549 --> 00:36:37.469]  Oh, I think it's been around for quite a long time.
[00:36:37.489 --> 00:36:40.651]  I mean, I've been prosecuting here for 10 years, and...
[00:36:41.147 --> 00:36:49.811]  You know, we've always advocated to have the officers utilize a blood test as their primary test as opposed to the breath or the urine test, just because it's more accurate.
[00:36:49.931 --> 00:36:58.395]  Now, the road to hell is paved with good intentions, but I mean, imagine an old black and white movie if the Germans on the train would have been sticking needles in people.
[00:36:59.595 --> 00:37:03.657]  I mean, the government sticking needles in us, you don't think that's Big Brother?
[00:37:04.855 --> 00:37:09.759]  I don't think in the context of an OWI arrest, no, because they lawfully can do it.
[00:37:10.199 --> 00:37:11.340]  A blood draw can be done.
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.121]  Now, the officer thinks they're on drugs.
[00:37:13.341 --> 00:37:18.004]  In the other states I've seen, they say they take the blood to also look for other drugs.
[00:37:18.064 --> 00:37:19.706]  Right, and we've done that, too.
[00:37:19.746 --> 00:37:34.516]  We've had, once the blood test has been obtained, the result has been obtained, we have them all sent to our state laboratory of hygiene, and most of the time they're just doing the screens for alcohol, but we've also, on occasions...
[00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:42.526]  ...had them run a screen for drugs, too, because we have seen situations where there's a combination of drugs and alcohol.
[00:37:43.707 --> 00:37:45.068]  What do you do if it's legal drugs?
[00:37:45.148 --> 00:37:47.610]  Because Ritalin is legal methamphetamine.
[00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:49.652]  Prozac is a legal hallucinogen.
[00:37:50.352 --> 00:37:53.074]  I mean, what do you do about all the legal drugs they got everybody hopped up on?
[00:37:53.434 --> 00:38:00.260]  Well, it depends, because our law actually, conceivably, you could be prosecuted for operating under the influence of a...
[00:38:01.201 --> 00:38:05.867]  I'll be drugged, even though the drug is legal, if it impairs your ability to safely operate.
[00:38:05.887 --> 00:38:11.414]  So if you don't commit suicide from the Prozac, you'll end up in jail either way, so it's kind of a great system.
[00:38:11.434 --> 00:38:12.496]  Well, not necessarily, no.
[00:38:12.556 --> 00:38:13.858]  That's not necessarily it.
[00:38:13.938 --> 00:38:16.822]  I'm sure you heard about the suicide with the drugs.
[00:38:18.074 --> 00:38:18.275]  No.
[00:38:18.835 --> 00:38:19.896]  I'm going to read that article later.
[00:38:20.136 --> 00:38:24.140]  Yeah, back in the 83 trials of Prozac, they found it caused a lot of suicide.
[00:38:24.541 --> 00:38:25.802]  So what, they go ahead and bring it forward.
[00:38:26.443 --> 00:38:28.024]  So this is to keep us all safe.
[00:38:28.965 --> 00:38:31.407]  Has anybody died not giving blood in Wisconsin?
[00:38:31.447 --> 00:38:32.609]  No, not that I'm aware of.
[00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:37.033]  And all our draws are done either in a hospital setting...
[00:38:38.017 --> 00:38:42.199]  Or we've had a medical provider come into the actual jail and do the draw there.
[00:38:42.279 --> 00:38:44.180]  What do you do if somebody refuses?
[00:38:45.561 --> 00:39:00.387]  If somebody refuses, and we've had this situation come up where they've essentially said, you're going to have to hold me down to do it, and the law does allow us to use, the officers to use a reasonable amount of force to obtain the blood sample.
[00:39:00.427 --> 00:39:02.368]  But typically what happens is,
[00:39:03.738 --> 00:39:10.222]  The suspect will ask the nurse if they can do it, and the nurse will tell them, yeah, they can, and then the person cooperates.
[00:39:10.463 --> 00:39:17.847]  In 10 years, I've not seen a situation in my county where somebody's actually been physically held down to have the blood sample.
[00:39:17.867 --> 00:39:23.631]  Were you familiar with the executive order Clinton signed in 1993 for urine and blood testing at driver's license facilities?
[00:39:23.951 --> 00:39:27.093]  That's actually the law, but they've never implemented it.
[00:39:27.113 --> 00:39:31.856]  I wonder what people are going to think going to get their driver's license when it's not just biometrics, but they want our blood.
[00:39:32.752 --> 00:39:35.874]  I'm not aware of that at all, and I don't think that's done up here at all.
[00:39:35.974 --> 00:39:40.215]  Have you heard of the public schools now wanting President Bush wants to drug test everybody?
[00:39:41.796 --> 00:39:41.996]  No.
[00:39:43.257 --> 00:39:45.598]  Yeah, he gave a radio address a few weeks ago.
[00:39:45.698 --> 00:39:49.259]  I'm sure you've heard that a lot of schools are moving to drug testing everybody.
[00:39:49.279 --> 00:39:49.799]  You didn't hear that?
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:52.301]  Drug testing teachers or students?
[00:39:52.381 --> 00:39:52.981]  All the students.
[00:39:53.361 --> 00:39:54.802]  No, I'm not aware of that.
[00:39:54.842 --> 00:39:55.542]  What do you think of that?
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:00.343]  Well, I guess it depends on what the circumstances are for the particular school.
[00:40:01.003 --> 00:40:01.323]  I don't know.
[00:40:01.343 --> 00:40:03.024]  It's hard to comment on something like that.
[00:40:03.064 --> 00:40:04.785]  Let me just say this.
[00:40:04.966 --> 00:40:16.453]  Okay, the Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the rest of it, and I've got the federal plans on this, the National Seat Belt Initiative Program Part 3, they admit it's about getting us used to checkpoints, getting us used to having our vehicles searched.
[00:40:16.953 --> 00:40:30.358]  Getting us used to having our masters, the government, our owners, and I appreciate the great job you do owning us and running us, but at the same time, people are getting very angry about this, and I'm not going to give my blood to anybody.
[00:40:30.498 --> 00:40:31.518]  I don't drink and drive.
[00:40:33.519 --> 00:40:36.180]  So I guess the police now are judge, jury, and executioner.
[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:42.082]  They just go ahead and arrest me and take me on down to have my blood sucked, or if I'm in Nevada, or if I'm in...
[00:40:43.303 --> 00:40:44.724]  Someplace like Arizona, I guess.
[00:40:44.964 --> 00:40:49.845]  They'll just hold me down on the side of the highway in a bed of fire ants and jab the needles into me.
[00:40:51.026 --> 00:40:54.327]  You know, I don't know what goes on in those other states.
[00:40:54.387 --> 00:40:57.728]  I only deal with what goes on in my jurisdiction in my state.
[00:40:57.788 --> 00:41:00.249]  I would find that kind of hard to believe that that would happen.
[00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:03.350]  You find it hard to believe.
[00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:06.311]  So you're not aware of a bunch of the stuff I brought up to you?
[00:41:06.671 --> 00:41:06.892]  No.
[00:41:08.512 --> 00:41:10.353]  Well, you know, I have to tell you that...
[00:41:11.579 --> 00:41:16.763]  I don't think the cost of giving up my liberty for so-called security is worth it.
[00:41:17.564 --> 00:41:28.512]  And to have this going on in our society, I think it's scary that they're leaving the breathalyzer, which will find somebody if they're drunk.
[00:41:29.279 --> 00:41:31.100]  And moving into sticking needles in me.
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.240]  That's very invasive.
[00:41:32.641 --> 00:41:48.888]  Well, but the problem is, you know, the law does allow when somebody, at least in my state, and I'm sure this is probably consistent in other states, once you're placed lawfully under arrest for drunk driving, law enforcement officials have the option of obtaining evidence, and the blood is evidence of a crime.
[00:41:48.908 --> 00:41:51.329]  So they're law enforcement officials and authorities.
[00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:52.069]  They're not servants.
[00:41:52.688 --> 00:41:58.075]  What do you mean by... Well, we used to, just ten years ago, it was law enforcement, public servants, peace officers.
[00:41:58.135 --> 00:41:59.396]  It's enforcement now.
[00:42:00.418 --> 00:42:01.599]  It's authorities.
[00:42:01.699 --> 00:42:02.860]  It's officials.
[00:42:03.521 --> 00:42:04.322]  I'm not sure.
[00:42:04.963 --> 00:42:05.524]  Semantics.
[00:42:05.684 --> 00:42:08.788]  A police officer puts somebody under arrest for an O.W.I., and...
[00:42:10.222 --> 00:42:15.444]  You know, they have the lawful... What I'm saying, sir, is that the semantics are very important.
[00:42:15.724 --> 00:42:17.765]  For ten years now, we've been called civilians.
[00:42:18.405 --> 00:42:19.505]  Police are civilians.
[00:42:19.926 --> 00:42:22.166]  Our mayor here in Austin calls us civilians.
[00:42:22.306 --> 00:42:23.647]  Is this a military government?
[00:42:24.767 --> 00:42:26.488]  I don't know what your mayor calls you down there.
[00:42:27.308 --> 00:42:30.890]  Well, don't your police call people in Wisconsin civilians?
[00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:36.932]  I suppose someplace in the state they may do that, but I'm not aware that they do it here.
[00:42:38.331 --> 00:42:40.193]  Well, look, this is the point I'm trying to make to you.
[00:42:40.454 --> 00:42:43.097]  I'm a little lost with the point.
[00:42:43.137 --> 00:42:46.501]  Well, Mr. O'Boyle, you know, I had you on.
[00:42:46.801 --> 00:42:50.245]  You don't sound like a mean guy, so I'm not going to jump on you like I planned to do.
[00:42:50.265 --> 00:42:53.549]  But this is what I'm trying to say to you, okay?
[00:42:54.232 --> 00:42:56.273]  This is what I'm trying to get across to you.
[00:42:56.293 --> 00:42:57.734]  You can say it's the law.
[00:42:58.094 --> 00:43:00.455]  We had a law that black people weren't human beings.
[00:43:00.495 --> 00:43:01.475]  That doesn't make it just.
[00:43:01.735 --> 00:43:04.176]  We had a law that black people couldn't ride at the front of the bus.
[00:43:04.396 --> 00:43:05.217]  That doesn't make it just.
[00:43:05.417 --> 00:43:06.837]  We had a law that women couldn't vote.
[00:43:06.857 --> 00:43:07.698]  That doesn't make it just.
[00:43:07.918 --> 00:43:20.723]  So just because the courts say that you can have the nice men down at the jail sticking needles in us, and you've got your reasons to stop the evil drunk drivers, it's scary, it's out of control, it's Big Brother.
[00:43:21.884 --> 00:43:22.084]  Well...
[00:43:23.149 --> 00:43:24.370]  I guess that's your opinion.
[00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:27.551]  I don't necessarily agree with that.
[00:43:28.591 --> 00:43:32.613]  Well, have I got you the articles out of Nevada and places where they do it on the side of the road?
[00:43:32.793 --> 00:43:36.755]  We found photos this morning of the police sticking the needle in somebody on the side of the road.
[00:43:37.735 --> 00:43:40.276]  So you agree that's pretty scary?
[00:43:40.536 --> 00:43:43.197]  Well, I would agree.
[00:43:43.737 --> 00:43:47.239]  I would wonder why that's being done before I would go that far.
[00:43:47.319 --> 00:43:48.859]  What authority would they have to do it?
[00:43:48.879 --> 00:43:52.701]  If it was being done with absolutely no lawful authority, yeah, that's scary.
[00:43:53.536 --> 00:43:54.417]  Well, you know the law.
[00:43:54.477 --> 00:43:58.960]  We're under arrest when the blue and reds go on.
[00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.001]  No, we're not.
[00:44:01.282 --> 00:44:01.582]  Oh, really?
[00:44:01.622 --> 00:44:05.084]  Well, I'll get chased and gunned down if I don't stop.
[00:44:07.466 --> 00:44:08.327]  No, I doubt that.
[00:44:08.627 --> 00:44:10.968]  Oh, you haven't watched Fox News with the chases?
[00:44:12.169 --> 00:44:13.771]  I don't get Fox News up here.
[00:44:14.331 --> 00:44:20.455]  Well, so you're saying I'm not under arrest in your county when the blue and reds go on?
[00:44:20.655 --> 00:44:21.316]  All right, right.
[00:44:21.914 --> 00:44:22.395]  Definitely.
[00:44:22.595 --> 00:44:24.438]  Well, then what am I under when they do that?
[00:44:24.938 --> 00:44:25.699]  You're being stopped.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.241]  But you're not under arouse.
[00:44:27.662 --> 00:44:29.485]  Well, I don't think you've read the case law.
[00:44:30.025 --> 00:44:30.326]  Pardon?
[00:44:30.346 --> 00:44:32.348]  I don't think you've read the case law.
[00:44:32.368 --> 00:44:33.450]  Oh, I'm well familiar.
[00:44:34.921 --> 00:44:36.162]  Well, let me just bring this up to you.
[00:44:36.402 --> 00:44:39.504]  I'm sure you heard about the Supreme Court case about you have to show your ID.
[00:44:40.025 --> 00:44:45.929]  The courts have ruled hundreds of times, over 20 times in the Supreme Court, that you don't have to show your ID walking down the street.
[00:44:46.289 --> 00:44:47.790]  You do with a motor vehicle, they claim.
[00:44:48.171 --> 00:44:53.454]  But the Supreme Court is moving to say, oh, you've got to show your ID.
[00:44:53.835 --> 00:44:56.076]  I mean, do you think I've got to show my ID when I'm walking my dog?
[00:44:56.477 --> 00:44:57.617]  Legally, you don't have to.
[00:44:58.218 --> 00:44:58.958]  It's just said that.
[00:44:59.179 --> 00:45:00.940]  But they still arrest people all the time for it.
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:01.620]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.442]  Well, that's pretty broad.
[00:45:04.082 --> 00:45:06.003]  Broad, sweeping statement.
[00:45:06.103 --> 00:45:08.224]  In Austin, Texas, it's called failure to ID.
[00:45:08.464 --> 00:45:08.824]  What's that?
[00:45:09.124 --> 00:45:10.724]  It's called failure to ID here.
[00:45:10.744 --> 00:45:13.525]  You're in Texas, correct?
[00:45:13.806 --> 00:45:14.146]  Yes, sir.
[00:45:14.446 --> 00:45:19.688]  I'm not familiar with your state's laws, so... Look, I'm just trying to pick your brain on several issues here.
[00:45:19.708 --> 00:45:20.648]  I know what you're trying to do.
[00:45:21.228 --> 00:45:23.089]  Do the people love this up in Wisconsin?
[00:45:23.109 --> 00:45:26.550]  Do the people love what?
[00:45:29.272 --> 00:45:39.416]  I think the people see the seriousness and the dangers of drunk driving, and I don't think they have a problem with the laws being enforced lawfully.
[00:45:39.896 --> 00:45:40.837]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:45:40.877 --> 00:45:42.457]  I do this in Austin and in D.C.
[00:45:42.497 --> 00:45:43.097]  and other areas.
[00:45:43.378 --> 00:45:46.119]  Do your police go in bars to arrest drunks in the bars?
[00:45:47.819 --> 00:45:50.060]  In ten years, I haven't seen that kind of situation.
[00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:51.501]  You haven't heard about that going on either?
[00:45:51.941 --> 00:45:52.021]  No.
[00:45:52.791 --> 00:45:53.692]  Oh, that's a big story.
[00:45:53.732 --> 00:45:58.258]  In fact, they go into places where they serve food, people aren't even drinking, just randomly fill paddy wagons.
[00:45:58.739 --> 00:45:59.640]  I bet you don't believe that.
[00:46:00.942 --> 00:46:03.505]  You know, I would really want to see the details on that.
[00:46:04.827 --> 00:46:07.250]  Washington Times last year did a big article on it.
[00:46:08.872 --> 00:46:11.055]  Have you heard about the FBI crime lab framing people?
[00:46:13.704 --> 00:46:13.904]  No.
[00:46:14.304 --> 00:46:18.146]  Well, I've had the former head-on of the crime lab, Dr. Frederick Whitehurst.
[00:46:18.446 --> 00:46:21.287]  This type, Dr. Frederick Whitehurst, exposes crime lab.
[00:46:22.108 --> 00:46:24.929]  Did you hear about Tulia, Texas, where they arrested the 50-plus people?
[00:46:25.269 --> 00:46:26.630]  No drugs or paraphernalia found?
[00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:28.590]  You know, I'm in Wisconsin.
[00:46:28.851 --> 00:46:32.212]  I don't keep up with the news that goes on in your state.
[00:46:32.292 --> 00:46:38.855]  Well, my point is, I don't even trust the government now to give us real tests, to give us real results.
[00:46:43.325 --> 00:46:44.005]  Mr. O'Boyle?
[00:46:44.125 --> 00:46:44.405]  Yeah?
[00:46:45.006 --> 00:46:46.566]  I don't have confidence in this government.
[00:46:46.887 --> 00:46:48.487]  I don't have confidence in its activities.
[00:46:49.248 --> 00:46:50.288]  Is there something wrong with me?
[00:46:52.369 --> 00:46:54.170]  You certainly are entitled to your opinion.
[00:46:55.991 --> 00:47:00.332]  I suppose if you don't like it, you can move, but you're certainly entitled to your opinion.
[00:47:00.533 --> 00:47:01.233]  Well, wait a minute.
[00:47:01.493 --> 00:47:02.994]  I mean, yeah, but I'm going to stay here.
[00:47:03.054 --> 00:47:08.176]  I want to make people move out of the country that want to pull me over and jam needles in my arm.
[00:47:11.570 --> 00:47:13.831]  I mean, I want America to be America, Mr. Boyle.
[00:47:16.652 --> 00:47:17.113]  Oh, Boyle.
[00:47:17.213 --> 00:47:17.453]  Yeah?
[00:47:18.093 --> 00:47:19.374]  I'm trying to find something out here.
[00:47:19.554 --> 00:47:23.736]  Have you heard about the national news stories about cameras in school bathrooms?
[00:47:24.796 --> 00:47:26.117]  You know, no.
[00:47:26.177 --> 00:47:29.378]  And you keep asking me about stories here, there, and everywhere.
[00:47:29.418 --> 00:47:30.839]  No, I'm not aware of those.
[00:47:30.939 --> 00:47:32.000]  Well, because it all goes together.
[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:39.863]  I thought you wanted to talk about OWI laws and blood draws, not newspaper articles from all over the place.
[00:47:40.003 --> 00:47:40.984]  I'm not familiar with them.
[00:47:41.554 --> 00:47:44.195]  I'm not in any position to comment on articles.
[00:47:44.215 --> 00:47:45.916]  Well, let me give you an example of why I'm saying this.
[00:47:46.276 --> 00:47:49.218]  You're prosecuting a guy that's got a long rap sheet.
[00:47:49.758 --> 00:47:52.579]  You want to bring in his criminal record to the jury.
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:57.802]  So I'm trying to give you a snapshot of the stuff that's going on to find out.
[00:47:57.862 --> 00:48:01.884]  I want to see what's going on in your head, why you think this blood sucking's okay.
[00:48:02.264 --> 00:48:06.546]  So I'm trying to find out here to see if you're informed, to see if you know what's going on.
[00:48:07.667 --> 00:48:08.187]  About what?
[00:48:09.207 --> 00:48:10.448]  About the Orwellian...
[00:48:11.596 --> 00:48:13.978]  There's garbage going on in the country.
[00:48:15.799 --> 00:48:25.765]  I'm not sure what that has to do with my law enforcement officers in this office, our office enforcing the OWI laws in the state of Wisconsin in my jurisdiction.
[00:48:25.785 --> 00:48:27.366]  Well, have you read the Wall Street Journal article?
[00:48:27.606 --> 00:48:28.567]  You know, I have not seen it.
[00:48:29.267 --> 00:48:34.871]  I was surprised to actually get the phone call about this whole article because I have not seen it yet.
[00:48:35.011 --> 00:48:36.532]  Were you interviewed by the Wall Street Journal?
[00:48:36.552 --> 00:48:39.374]  Yeah, I was, and it was quite some time ago.
[00:48:40.236 --> 00:48:41.697]  Well, this just came out yesterday.
[00:48:42.237 --> 00:48:45.700]  It's on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, sir.
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:49.602]  Yeah, I've not seen the article, so... You can go read it after you get off the show.
[00:48:49.622 --> 00:48:50.363]  I imagine you are.
[00:48:51.243 --> 00:48:52.744]  But this is what I'm trying to get at.
[00:48:52.784 --> 00:48:53.765]  It's a scary article.
[00:48:54.706 --> 00:48:56.027]  Police are killing people.
[00:48:56.667 --> 00:48:57.588]  They're holding them down.
[00:48:57.628 --> 00:48:59.309]  They're doing this all over the country.
[00:48:59.829 --> 00:49:01.590]  The story doesn't say your people are doing that.
[00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:02.331]  Right, but you're...
[00:49:02.987 --> 00:49:03.787]  Pretty much saying that.
[00:49:03.807 --> 00:49:12.992]  You're saying everybody's doing it based on articles and things that have happened in different parts of the country, and that's not really a fair characterization of everything.
[00:49:13.232 --> 00:49:14.653]  Well, no, I just clearly stated.
[00:49:15.594 --> 00:49:16.994]  I'm asking you if you guys did.
[00:49:17.234 --> 00:49:21.617]  You're saying no, and I was making clear yet again that you're not in that part of the article.
[00:49:21.637 --> 00:49:23.978]  I made clear that it was Nevada we were talking about.
[00:49:24.598 --> 00:49:30.860]  It would be almost impossible for me to comment on something that's happened in Nevada that I have no knowledge of.
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:44.544]  I literally read to you from the Wall Street Journal, and I'm just trying to talk about this progression here, and as a public servant, as an official, an authority, I was trying to find out what your view on it is.
[00:49:45.798 --> 00:49:56.362]  It's hard for me to give a view on something that I'm not familiar with what articles... Is that what we grew up to think of America as guys in black uniforms, holding somebody down, putting a needle in their arm?
[00:49:57.563 --> 00:49:57.983]  I don't know.
[00:49:58.023 --> 00:49:59.784]  It depends on each given person.
[00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:05.512]  Do you guys still wear blue uniforms up there, or are they black uniforms?
[00:50:05.632 --> 00:50:06.773]  I don't wear a uniform at all.
[00:50:06.813 --> 00:50:07.653]  No, I mean your police.
[00:50:08.053 --> 00:50:09.134]  You know, they have different colors.
[00:50:09.194 --> 00:50:11.575]  Different agencies have different color uniforms.
[00:50:11.795 --> 00:50:13.236]  What's your county SWAT team symbol?
[00:50:13.276 --> 00:50:15.357]  Is it a skull or a cobra?
[00:50:15.558 --> 00:50:16.398]  I don't think it's either one.
[00:50:16.958 --> 00:50:17.539]  Black widow?
[00:50:17.859 --> 00:50:18.059]  No.
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:20.680]  Well, what is it then?
[00:50:22.461 --> 00:50:24.823]  I'm almost thinking it's an eagle if they have a symbol at all.
[00:50:24.903 --> 00:50:25.063]  An eagle?
[00:50:25.143 --> 00:50:27.464]  I don't know if they have a symbol, to be honest with you.
[00:50:27.484 --> 00:50:28.065]  An eagle?
[00:50:28.105 --> 00:50:29.686]  Well, that's good.
[00:50:29.726 --> 00:50:30.346]  Good old eagle.
[00:50:31.658 --> 00:50:36.101]  All right, well, John O'Boyle, I'll let you go and go read the article.
[00:50:36.301 --> 00:50:39.863]  We appreciate you coming on the show, and I don't think you're a bad guy.
[00:50:39.883 --> 00:50:46.227]  I think you mean well, but this isn't America, and you need to research the things I've told you about because it's all documented.
[00:50:47.788 --> 00:50:48.408]  Okay, right on it.
[00:50:48.909 --> 00:50:49.109]  Thanks.
[00:50:49.469 --> 00:50:50.189]  All right, God bless.
[00:50:50.209 --> 00:50:53.651]  Have fun out there with the needles.
[00:50:54.852 --> 00:50:56.453]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:56.713 --> 00:50:59.475]  We'll let you respond to his authority-ness.
[00:51:01.155 --> 00:51:08.000]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.301 --> 00:51:09.682]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:09.882 --> 00:51:12.084]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.244 --> 00:51:14.325]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:14.586 --> 00:51:19.529]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:23.913]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.153 --> 00:51:25.934]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:25.994 --> 00:51:36.642]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and planable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:36.802 --> 00:51:38.703]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:51:38.903 --> 00:51:42.786]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[00:51:42.866 --> 00:51:44.287]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[00:51:51.653 --> 00:51:52.594]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:52:00.598 --> 00:52:04.501]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:52:04.741 --> 00:52:10.165]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:52:10.445 --> 00:52:20.812]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:52:20.972 --> 00:52:25.315]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:25.515 --> 00:52:33.859]  Trihalomethane and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:52:34.139 --> 00:52:40.502]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:52:40.622 --> 00:52:45.084]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:45.304 --> 00:52:49.526]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[00:53:46.582 --> 00:53:49.684]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:49.844 --> 00:53:55.707]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:04.369 --> 00:54:04.870]  Don't worry.
[00:54:05.350 --> 00:54:06.871]  This show is documented.
[00:54:07.392 --> 00:54:10.155]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:10.595 --> 00:54:18.542]  A few side issues that connect into this blood-sucking situation.
[00:54:19.323 --> 00:54:23.187]  Alaska, Arizona, Iowa, Florida, Indiana, Michigan, Nevada, and Texas...
[00:54:24.258 --> 00:54:35.886]  Have in recent years enacted statutes specifically permitting police to use reasonable force to obtain blood samples in DUI cases, and that includes killing quite a few people by beating their brains out or crushing their skulls.
[00:54:36.706 --> 00:54:38.548]  And it gets into all that and how wonderful it is.
[00:54:39.188 --> 00:54:44.552]  We'll go to your calls here in a few minutes, but also have articles out of Arizona, out of Illinois.
[00:54:44.592 --> 00:54:51.296]  These are posted in the archives of Infowars.com and PrisonPlanta.com, or just type keywords and the search engines will come up.
[00:54:51.716 --> 00:54:52.397]  It's a great tool.
[00:54:53.654 --> 00:54:58.757]  Before 9-11, troops at high schools, middle schools, oh, we had a list of kids who hadn't had their vaccines.
[00:54:59.057 --> 00:55:00.478]  We dropped by to give it to them.
[00:55:00.498 --> 00:55:06.201]  The National Guard or photos out of the Arizona Republic of the girl crying as the troops give her the shot.
[00:55:06.821 --> 00:55:08.482]  Didn't tell the parents, didn't tell anybody.
[00:55:08.522 --> 00:55:13.325]  Had them sign a waiver form before, like a month before, that, oh, we'll be giving them shots they hadn't had them.
[00:55:13.505 --> 00:55:15.346]  Then had troops come in, lined them up.
[00:55:16.138 --> 00:55:19.580]  I got articles out of Pensacola where the troops marched around going, Martial law!
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:20.321]  Martial law!
[00:55:20.341 --> 00:55:22.582]  Bill Clinton wants you to know what martial law is!
[00:55:23.002 --> 00:55:24.743]  People never believe that story until they go read it.
[00:55:26.004 --> 00:55:27.625]  I mean, this is the real stuff that's going on.
[00:55:27.665 --> 00:55:32.888]  So it also gets the police used to sticking needles in you.
[00:55:32.968 --> 00:55:34.009]  Gets them into that area.
[00:55:34.149 --> 00:55:34.829]  Acclimates you.
[00:55:34.889 --> 00:55:36.430]  It's all part of a larger program.
[00:55:37.651 --> 00:55:38.271]  And you know what?
[00:55:38.291 --> 00:55:41.153]  I think I'm going to get the widow on of Mr. Jones.
[00:55:43.127 --> 00:55:43.647]  Oh, yes.
[00:55:44.868 --> 00:55:45.989]  It's amazing here.
[00:55:46.409 --> 00:55:52.693]  Testimony in a federal suit last year shows that authorities in Las Vegas regularly obtain blood samples in Clark County Detention Center.
[00:55:53.774 --> 00:55:55.234]  The suit involved a 98 incident.
[00:55:55.575 --> 00:56:01.418]  Police found Terry Jones, then 33, asleep at the wheel of a parked car and opened Budweiser between his thighs.
[00:56:02.439 --> 00:56:05.541]  He was arrested, taken to jail, and ordered to submit to a blood test.
[00:56:06.701 --> 00:56:10.124]  Mr. Jones, who had two prior DUI convictions, fought a furious fight.
[00:56:10.444 --> 00:56:12.445]  Now, they always use someone who's guilty as an example.
[00:56:13.295 --> 00:56:19.317]  And it says, Guard Daniel Kurtzke testified that physical resistance to blood draws was a nightly event.
[00:56:19.677 --> 00:56:29.740]  Guards would use whatever force is necessary to testify, typically handcuffing defendants' arms behind their backs, bending them over on an examination table in the jail nurse's office and holding them down.
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:32.540]  Sometimes drivers were held on the floor.
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.041]  We always got our blood.
[00:56:34.501 --> 00:56:38.842]  I've talked to people who've been arrested in their houses for not paying a traffic warrant.
[00:56:39.498 --> 00:56:43.440]  And they take their blood and do blood tests.
[00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:45.320]  We got him in here for not paying a warrant.
[00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:46.341]  Let's go ahead and take blood.
[00:56:46.361 --> 00:56:47.121]  I forgot about that.
[00:56:48.342 --> 00:56:52.263]  Mr. Jones, 270 pounds, tossed several officers off his back with the buck of his head.
[00:56:52.283 --> 00:56:58.145]  Two officers then testified that the other officer stood on his head and kicked him in the face, and he died.
[00:57:00.046 --> 00:57:02.107]  So that's the love of the New World Order for you.
[00:57:04.571 --> 00:57:10.868]  We'll break and come back and go straight to your calls and to all this other Big Brother and 9-11, Whitewash Commission news.
[00:57:11.129 --> 00:57:11.870]  Just stay with us.
[00:57:11.890 --> 00:57:13.054]  We've got two hours left here.
[00:57:13.658 --> 00:57:22.960]  Before I end this dwindling hour, I hope all of you get my powerful, full-length feature, professionally produced info weapons.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:27.261]  My videos, my books, the pro-gun liberal t-shirts.
[00:57:27.321 --> 00:57:28.441]  Is it liberal to be pro-gun?
[00:57:28.461 --> 00:57:29.221]  No.
[00:57:29.241 --> 00:57:31.822]  You need to get the videos, the books, the t-shirts.
[00:57:31.842 --> 00:57:33.802]  You need to get the word out, educate others.
[00:57:34.222 --> 00:57:38.623]  Now people are very open to be woken up right now.
[00:57:39.562 --> 00:57:40.362]  So take action.
[00:57:40.923 --> 00:57:42.003]  The videos are excellent.
[00:57:42.043 --> 00:57:49.846]  Matrix of Evil, Masters of Terror, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, My Book, Descent into Tyranny.
[00:57:50.226 --> 00:57:51.007]  The videos are $25.95.
[00:57:51.267 --> 00:57:55.109]  $20 if you order three or more of any of the ten videos.
[00:57:55.669 --> 00:57:57.810]  Toll-free number to order.
[00:57:57.830 --> 00:58:00.811]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:03.672 --> 00:58:04.192]  Don't wait.
[00:58:04.432 --> 00:58:05.253]  Be part of history.
[00:58:05.293 --> 00:58:05.913]  Get in the fight.
[00:58:06.173 --> 00:58:08.014]  Best tools we've found are these videos.
[00:58:08.514 --> 00:58:12.938]  1-888-253-3139 or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:58:12.978 --> 00:58:14.339]  Stop procrastinating.
[00:58:14.359 --> 00:58:15.601]  Take action today.
[00:58:15.621 --> 00:58:15.681]  1-888-253-3139
[00:58:36.104 --> 00:58:41.849]  Or prisonplanet.com or infowars.com to order via our secure, safe online shopping cart.
[00:58:42.709 --> 00:58:45.551]  Second hour, only 70 seconds away.
[00:58:45.612 --> 00:58:48.033]  Your calls, ton of news, more gas.
[00:58:48.053 --> 00:58:48.594]  Stay with us.
[00:58:52.816 --> 00:58:57.319]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:01.763]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:59:02.063 --> 00:59:02.603]  We listened.
[00:59:02.923 --> 00:59:07.907]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:59:08.167 --> 00:59:08.668]  We listened.
[00:59:09.048 --> 00:59:12.090]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:13.031]  We listened.
[00:59:13.491 --> 00:59:17.575]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:59:17.935 --> 00:59:18.435]  We listened.
[00:59:18.776 --> 00:59:24.020]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:59:24.421 --> 00:59:25.802]  Again, we listened.
[00:59:26.142 --> 00:59:33.548]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:59:33.929 --> 00:59:37.372]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter for only $259 by calling
[00:59:43.408 --> 00:59:44.411]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:59:44.431 --> 00:59:46.036]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:59:57.732 --> 00:59:58.373]  Big Brother.
[00:59:59.033 --> 01:00:00.094]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:00.815 --> 01:00:01.915]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.576 --> 01:00:03.396]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.137 --> 01:00:05.018]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.038 --> 01:00:09.301]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.881 --> 01:00:14.004]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.405 --> 01:00:23.631]  You don't just have to worry about mosquitoes when you're standing outside your car with your family as they throw your goods all over the side of the road at a checkpoint.
[01:00:24.688 --> 01:00:27.491]  Now you've got to worry about them sticking needles in you and your family.
[01:00:27.531 --> 01:00:29.813]  Same thing in the public schools, urine and blood testing.
[01:00:30.153 --> 01:00:31.334]  Feds want to make it federal law.
[01:00:31.354 --> 01:00:33.937]  They're already funding it in literally thousands of school districts.
[01:00:34.377 --> 01:00:35.618]  Everyone being drug tested.
[01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:41.444]  Wall Street Journal yesterday posted on the sites today, Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:00:43.024 --> 01:00:45.145]  In push to stop drunk driving, of course.
[01:00:45.265 --> 01:00:48.666]  They're sucking your blood on the side of the road and in the police stations.
[01:00:49.466 --> 01:00:51.767]  And, oh, they're killing people that resist.
[01:00:51.987 --> 01:00:52.827]  That's in the article.
[01:00:53.268 --> 01:00:59.690]  So we'll take your calls on that, and we'll get to exploding gas prices, the whitewashed 9-11 commission, a bunch of Big Brother news.
[01:00:59.710 --> 01:01:01.430]  It's just going to be totally jam-packed.
[01:01:01.811 --> 01:01:02.771]  We've got to move quickly.
[01:01:03.391 --> 01:01:05.052]  As promised, let's go to your calls.
[01:01:05.112 --> 01:01:08.193]  Let's talk to Steve in Illinois, then Drew, Todd, William, and others.
[01:01:08.533 --> 01:01:09.313]  Steve, go ahead.
[01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:11.254]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:01:11.374 --> 01:01:11.574]  Good.
[01:01:12.611 --> 01:01:27.483]  I find it almost amusing how every time you talk to some state official, it's always the same old thing, oh, I don't care what goes on in other states, or I'm not up to date with what they do and this and that.
[01:01:27.983 --> 01:01:36.390]  But then if the feds come to mandate something, it's boom, let's get on the wagon with them automatically.
[01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:40.073]  What are you going to do at a checkpoint if they want to jam needles in you and your family?
[01:01:40.450 --> 01:01:41.331]  It's not going to happen.
[01:01:41.471 --> 01:01:44.533]  I mean, and more people got to stand up and say, no, this is not going to happen.
[01:01:45.254 --> 01:01:47.495]  I mean... Well, the jail guards and police are laughing.
[01:01:47.535 --> 01:01:50.458]  I mean, and some of these, they're killing people.
[01:01:52.079 --> 01:01:54.481]  Yeah, and... Do you hear me right where they killed that guy?
[01:01:55.241 --> 01:02:04.268]  You know, I hope to God that his family pushes that issue through court, and I hope justice prevails in that situation.
[01:02:04.528 --> 01:02:06.330]  I mean, what more... I mean, from...
[01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:13.176]  It's not bad enough you can't pull up to a stop sign without a cop standing there with a flashlight looking to see if you've got your seatbelt on now.
[01:02:13.857 --> 01:02:16.740]  At their seatbelt enforcement zones.
[01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:29.052]  But again, the federal plan admits, Part 3 of the National Seatbelt Initiative Act of 1998, $2.4 billion a year since then, they admit, sir, and this is a very key point,
[01:02:30.318 --> 01:02:30.658]  What is that?
[01:02:30.958 --> 01:02:32.859]  Almost $10 billion now they've spent since then?
[01:02:33.239 --> 01:02:33.600]  Or more?
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:38.922]  They admit it's to train you to accept checkpoints and to search your car for drugs and guns.
[01:02:39.462 --> 01:02:40.182]  Well, sure it is.
[01:02:40.382 --> 01:02:43.984]  And Mr. State Boy that you talked to earlier is so independent.
[01:02:44.624 --> 01:02:46.425]  Well, then why don't they stand up against the Fed?
[01:02:46.625 --> 01:02:48.765]  They know we're not going to do that in our state.
[01:02:49.246 --> 01:02:51.727]  But instead, you know, it'll be, sure, bring it on in.
[01:02:51.887 --> 01:02:52.827]  You know, no problem.
[01:02:52.867 --> 01:02:54.948]  Well, number one, they're never going to stop drunk driving.
[01:02:55.589 --> 01:03:01.114]  These drunks aren't going to stop it, but that's their excuse to get into our lives, to set the precedent to jam needles in us.
[01:03:01.654 --> 01:03:08.100]  Well, what worse infringement on our liberty than to stick a needle in you?
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:09.281]  It's insane.
[01:03:09.481 --> 01:03:14.646]  But I've had the public officials on where they've got cameras in school bathrooms, and they say it's wonderful and it stops crime.
[01:03:15.246 --> 01:03:16.207]  We're the bad ones.
[01:03:16.708 --> 01:03:21.612]  Winston in 1984 is the bad one, because he doesn't like Big Brother having a camera in his bathroom.
[01:03:23.065 --> 01:03:26.646]  We don't want police helicopters with ground penetrating radar looking through our walls.
[01:03:27.026 --> 01:03:28.107]  We're weird.
[01:03:28.647 --> 01:03:30.827]  Well, I predict soon.
[01:03:31.007 --> 01:03:32.688]  You know, every state has different laws.
[01:03:33.148 --> 01:03:34.128]  Illinois is horrible.
[01:03:34.188 --> 01:03:36.649]  You've got to register to own guns.
[01:03:36.669 --> 01:03:38.249]  You know what registration leads to.
[01:03:38.830 --> 01:03:40.090]  Nobody banned most of them, yeah.
[01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:47.308]  It used to say on the application form, if you were convicted on the felony, have you been convicted on a felony in the past so many years?
[01:03:47.328 --> 01:03:49.191]  Now, the registration form changes.
[01:03:49.211 --> 01:03:51.574]  It says, have you been charged with a felony?
[01:03:51.954 --> 01:03:53.316]  Have you had a misdemeanor?
[01:03:54.286 --> 01:04:05.410]  In Maryland, they arrested man of the year who saved a bunch of police because 30 years ago, he got back from Vietnam and got in a bar fight.
[01:04:05.810 --> 01:04:08.271]  They said, oh, it's over $200 the thing he was convicted of.
[01:04:08.311 --> 01:04:09.311]  We're taking his guns.
[01:04:09.931 --> 01:04:20.455]  And now, if you go to court not even been charged or not even been convicted of, but if you're in court for any domestic violence court, you're in there for any reason,
[01:04:21.451 --> 01:04:23.472]  You get your gun card taken away from you.
[01:04:23.552 --> 01:04:26.394]  Your privilege card is bye-bye.
[01:04:26.734 --> 01:04:27.474]  Thanks for the call.
[01:04:28.775 --> 01:04:31.097]  Drew and Todd and William and others, you're up next.
[01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:32.838]  The toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:04:32.858 --> 01:04:35.519]  Always a good idea, I guess, to give that out.
[01:04:35.539 --> 01:04:35.599]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:04:35.619 --> 01:04:39.101]  Warrior Calls, a blitzkrieg of news, straight ahead, fighting against tyranny, defending liberty.
[01:04:55.658 --> 01:05:01.142]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:05:01.562 --> 01:05:05.785]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:05:06.025 --> 01:05:13.070]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:05:13.450 --> 01:05:19.574]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:05:19.694 --> 01:05:20.915]  There are no side effects.
[01:05:21.095 --> 01:05:21.555]  We're good to go.
[01:05:38.027 --> 01:05:41.169]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[01:05:41.189 --> 01:05:41.269]  866-885-6625.
[01:05:41.289 --> 01:05:41.329]  866-885-6625.
[01:05:41.530 --> 01:05:42.470]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:05:42.490 --> 01:05:42.690]  Call today.
[01:05:52.975 --> 01:05:57.322]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:57.522 --> 01:06:01.949]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:02.089 --> 01:06:06.456]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:06:06.516 --> 01:06:07.858]  The New World Order.
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:13.865]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:13.925 --> 01:06:20.853]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:20.993 --> 01:06:22.996]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:23.376 --> 01:06:33.779]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:33.979 --> 01:06:39.361]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:06:39.861 --> 01:06:42.522]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:06:42.622 --> 01:06:43.242]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:06:43.262 --> 01:06:43.622]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:06:43.642 --> 01:06:44.923]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:06:52.465 --> 01:06:55.746]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:06:55.806 --> 01:06:59.986]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:07:00.226 --> 01:07:03.007]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:07:03.207 --> 01:07:05.607]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:07:05.787 --> 01:07:14.449]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:07:14.629 --> 01:07:15.969]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:07:16.169 --> 01:07:20.350]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:21.111]  We're good to go.
[01:07:39.633 --> 01:07:40.093]  Big Brother.
[01:07:40.194 --> 01:07:41.355]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:41.535 --> 01:07:42.596]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:42.616 --> 01:07:43.177]  You want answers?
[01:08:04.264 --> 01:08:05.125]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:05.145 --> 01:08:09.770]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.010 --> 01:08:15.935]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:15.956 --> 01:08:25.465]  Right now, in Wisconsin, they're trying to pass a law, under federal funding, of course, to arrest adults, to take your children.
[01:08:26.508 --> 01:08:30.811]  Doesn't matter if you're an 80-year-old lady, you've got to take all the vaccines they say are mandatory.
[01:08:30.851 --> 01:08:35.494]  Whenever they say, whenever new vaccines they come out and make mandatory, you've got to take those too.
[01:08:35.694 --> 01:08:47.061]  And again, public officials, authorities, our masters, our rulers, our owners, our keepers, the people that run us and our lives and our free country.
[01:08:47.867 --> 01:08:49.909]  We'll just say it's for your safety.
[01:08:49.949 --> 01:08:51.250]  We're doing it for you.
[01:08:51.270 --> 01:08:52.771]  Doesn't matter how much evidence.
[01:08:52.832 --> 01:08:53.392]  It's poison.
[01:08:53.432 --> 01:08:54.013]  It's toxic.
[01:08:54.053 --> 01:08:55.034]  It's sterilizing us.
[01:08:55.394 --> 01:08:56.455]  It's brain damaging us.
[01:08:56.495 --> 01:08:56.955]  Doesn't matter.
[01:08:57.376 --> 01:08:57.896]  Doesn't matter.
[01:08:58.497 --> 01:08:59.257]  They love us.
[01:08:59.297 --> 01:09:00.058]  They're the government.
[01:09:00.078 --> 01:09:03.161]  They're already, through color of law, trying to act like it's the law.
[01:09:04.182 --> 01:09:04.902]  Let's talk to...
[01:09:06.297 --> 01:09:09.158]  Well, I guess up next is Drew in Texas.
[01:09:09.478 --> 01:09:10.298]  Drew, go ahead.
[01:09:10.878 --> 01:09:11.438]  Hi, Alex.
[01:09:11.459 --> 01:09:12.399]  Good to talk to you again.
[01:09:12.419 --> 01:09:13.259]  Good to talk to you.
[01:09:14.259 --> 01:09:18.501]  I couldn't believe that character, that Boyle character, the DA in Wisconsin.
[01:09:18.561 --> 01:09:21.241]  Yes, Mr. Boyle on the surface of America.
[01:09:21.781 --> 01:09:24.942]  I mean, the guy sounds like he's a high school dropout.
[01:09:25.002 --> 01:09:26.223]  He's a complete idiot.
[01:09:26.383 --> 01:09:29.184]  I can't believe the people up there would vote for somebody like that.
[01:09:29.204 --> 01:09:33.785]  I assume they elect their DAs up there like they do here or everywhere else.
[01:09:34.975 --> 01:09:40.178]  Well, you know, so many times you talk to the authorities, the officials.
[01:09:40.879 --> 01:09:42.540]  We're the civilians.
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:44.661]  And they just don't know anything.
[01:09:44.841 --> 01:09:52.305]  They just... But on that civilian point, you know, the semantics of how they're the military state, you had to go, yeah, I've heard that.
[01:09:52.405 --> 01:09:53.346]  What is that?
[01:09:53.726 --> 01:09:56.248]  But the guy sounds like he's completely the dark about everything.
[01:09:56.288 --> 01:09:58.709]  I mean, everything he brought up, he just, I'm not aware of this.
[01:09:58.749 --> 01:09:59.550]  I'm not aware of that.
[01:09:59.630 --> 01:10:01.911]  You know, I mean, was he been hiding under a rock or what?
[01:10:01.991 --> 01:10:03.412]  Well, it's like Sergeant Schultz.
[01:10:04.205 --> 01:10:05.666]  I know nothing.
[01:10:06.287 --> 01:10:07.107]  I know nothing.
[01:10:07.388 --> 01:10:08.148]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:13.392]  I know nothing.
[01:10:14.673 --> 01:10:16.014]  I followed the furor, y'all.
[01:10:16.034 --> 01:10:16.874]  It's like Bill Clinton.
[01:10:17.035 --> 01:10:18.296]  I know nothing.
[01:10:18.916 --> 01:10:19.576]  Listen to me.
[01:10:19.596 --> 01:10:22.058]  Hold on a minute.
[01:10:22.118 --> 01:10:22.839]  Hold on a minute.
[01:10:22.879 --> 01:10:26.041]  I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.
[01:10:26.482 --> 01:10:27.362]  Read my lips.
[01:10:27.442 --> 01:10:28.423]  No, no taxes.
[01:10:28.883 --> 01:10:29.244]  I'm sorry.
[01:10:29.264 --> 01:10:29.584]  Go ahead.
[01:10:31.135 --> 01:10:34.018]  Well, just like our little Lord Bush, he doesn't know anything either.
[01:10:34.979 --> 01:10:36.480]  Well, in his case, I believe it, so.
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:37.361]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:38.963 --> 01:10:40.865]  Oh, well, I guess that's about all I wanted.
[01:10:40.905 --> 01:10:42.326]  I couldn't believe that guy.
[01:10:42.346 --> 01:10:46.370]  I just wanted to throw in my two cents about that moron up there.
[01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:51.034]  What are you going to do if they want to take your blood on a dark night at the side of the road?
[01:10:53.365 --> 01:10:54.446]  Well, I'm not going to do it.
[01:10:55.546 --> 01:10:57.327]  I don't think that's happening in Austin, though, is it?
[01:10:57.387 --> 01:10:57.628]  Yet.
[01:10:57.928 --> 01:10:58.588]  Yet.
[01:10:58.688 --> 01:11:03.271]  Texas has, quote, passed the law, but they take you down and suck your blood at the police station.
[01:11:03.311 --> 01:11:06.793]  But I've read the articles where they're sucking the blood on the side of the road.
[01:11:07.693 --> 01:11:08.254]  Here in Austin?
[01:11:09.174 --> 01:11:13.197]  No, it was in Colorado, and it was in Nevada, and in Arizona, the articles I've seen.
[01:11:14.297 --> 01:11:14.538]  Yeah.
[01:11:15.058 --> 01:11:19.280]  Well, I know Arizona and Nevada are farther along toward a police state than we are.
[01:11:19.621 --> 01:11:21.982]  As bad as we are, they're even a little farther on, I think.
[01:11:22.449 --> 01:11:22.830]  I hear you.
[01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:24.271]  Good to get your call.
[01:11:24.872 --> 01:11:27.975]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Todd.
[01:11:27.995 --> 01:11:30.818]  And Todd is calling us from California.
[01:11:30.858 --> 01:11:31.258]  Go ahead.
[01:11:31.939 --> 01:11:32.219]  Yes, sir.
[01:11:32.259 --> 01:11:33.921]  That seemed like a boxing match.
[01:11:34.441 --> 01:11:41.609]  You got him on the ropes at some point, and you kept hitting with body blows about sources, and all he could do was say plausible deniability.
[01:11:42.150 --> 01:11:48.494]  The thing is, the judges are not on the side of truth, so he gets to actually pretend that he serves the people.
[01:11:48.834 --> 01:11:57.540]  My main concern is, when he finished up your interview, he gave that little snide remark of, I'll look into that kind of thing, but I don't think he's going to read when he finishes up the interview.
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:59.301]  He said, I'll look into that right away.
[01:12:00.061 --> 01:12:04.544]  No, no, but what he's going to do, he's going to call everyone who put him in that line of fire.
[01:12:04.964 --> 01:12:11.507]  And say, I'm going to chastise you, you, and you for even making me that exposed because I need to perpetuate my myth.
[01:12:11.647 --> 01:12:12.567]  Well, maybe he is.
[01:12:12.647 --> 01:12:22.451]  I mean, he's probably some sports fan who goes right to the sports bar immediately after work or, you know, goes to the local arena or maybe he goes and plays racquetball.
[01:12:22.491 --> 01:12:26.253]  I mean, he didn't even know he was in the Wall Street Journal until a day later.
[01:12:26.932 --> 01:12:28.893]  No, but all he had was plausible deniability.
[01:12:28.913 --> 01:12:32.474]  This guy was in the front page of the... Maybe he didn't know anything.
[01:12:32.754 --> 01:12:39.017]  This guy was in the front page of the Wall Street Journal yesterday, and no one let him know he was in it until we called him.
[01:12:39.937 --> 01:12:42.098]  Like I said... And then I said, did you interview the Wall Street Journal?
[01:12:42.138 --> 01:12:43.838]  He goes, uh, uh, uh, yeah, I did.
[01:12:45.646 --> 01:12:51.874]  But the end thing is, he wants to give you the impression, and even he didn't at the end, he gave you that little snide thing, but he's not going to look into it.
[01:12:52.115 --> 01:12:55.539]  He's going to call the people that set up that interview and chastise them.
[01:12:55.860 --> 01:13:02.889]  I had two direct questions for him, one of which was, Bush has been, or the current president has been diagnosed as vasovagal.
[01:13:03.397 --> 01:13:04.077]  I am that.
[01:13:04.237 --> 01:13:09.260]  And if you inject me with any kind of needle, even if it's a little thing, I might die on the scene.
[01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:16.183]  And it seems like what's being implied is that now cops can just inject people and if they die on the scene, it's no big deal.
[01:13:16.203 --> 01:13:18.263]  What if you're a hemophiliac?
[01:13:18.283 --> 01:13:21.425]  You'll be in there with all those goons and they're like, get him in the corner.
[01:13:21.725 --> 01:13:23.186]  We're gonna take your blood.
[01:13:23.826 --> 01:13:26.447]  He'll come to deliverance now, boy.
[01:13:27.179 --> 01:13:32.500]  But again, he goes back to the plausible deniability thing, because it's happened in Florida down here in the recent month.
[01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:40.642]  It happened in California, where they chased a guy who was about nine inches shorter than the real guy, and they eventually shot him.
[01:13:40.902 --> 01:13:42.742]  Or down here in Florida, where they tasered him.
[01:13:43.083 --> 01:13:43.883]  Oops, he died.
[01:13:43.983 --> 01:13:44.363]  And guess what?
[01:13:44.383 --> 01:13:45.543]  There's no real follow-up.
[01:13:47.444 --> 01:13:50.824]  He claimed that you're not under arrest when they stop you.
[01:13:51.064 --> 01:13:53.805]  Every cop knows you're under arrest, technically.
[01:13:54.065 --> 01:13:56.026]  No, that's exactly what I wanted to ask him about.
[01:13:56.046 --> 01:13:57.266]  Because those people died.
[01:13:57.286 --> 01:13:58.706]  And guess what the follow-up is?
[01:13:58.987 --> 01:14:00.347]  Those people are still dead.
[01:14:00.367 --> 01:14:04.648]  Well, they might have been working with Elkada.
[01:14:05.028 --> 01:14:06.369]  Well, yeah, demonization.
[01:14:06.389 --> 01:14:10.210]  And I wanted to ask the grander... And by the way, sir, I appreciate...
[01:14:10.785 --> 01:14:17.430]  You as a delivery mechanism of information, I appreciate the other message that you offer that's not about a cult of personality.
[01:14:17.850 --> 01:14:37.704]  I just say over the last two years or so, I understand that the information campus that's out there globally is a lot more vast based on the wing like you and other people out there that you're kind of just a professor talking out into the world and I appreciate that that's a whole new wing that I didn't know existed in the first place.
[01:14:38.104 --> 01:14:40.426]  In terms of double think, I think it's interesting that
[01:14:40.822 --> 01:14:52.705]  The same type of nationalist, militaristic mentality that's been sold to conquer nations and ultimately destroy nationhood is being used to perpetuate globalism.
[01:14:52.785 --> 01:14:56.466]  So it's almost like nationalism is being used to destroy nationalism.
[01:14:56.546 --> 01:14:58.647]  And what do you think that that double thing is?
[01:14:58.747 --> 01:15:08.690]  Well, they come into America, they destroy our sovereignty, then they wrap themselves in a plastic Chinese-made slave flag and then paint themselves up in it and camouflage.
[01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:10.130]  It's a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[01:15:10.530 --> 01:15:17.853]  They go, be nationalistic, and after decades of bashing nationalism, people go, yeah, it's okay to fly the flag again.
[01:15:18.373 --> 01:15:26.116]  But again, the flag's being used as a false symbol for those actually using America to destroy nationalism worldwide.
[01:15:26.516 --> 01:15:28.697]  Oh, Ed, but that is the ultimate double-think.
[01:15:29.237 --> 01:15:36.140]  It's disturbing to me, over a couple years now, to realize, hey, Brian Lamb, who I used to think was Mr. Objectivity...
[01:15:36.730 --> 01:15:37.531]  Maybe he's not.
[01:15:37.611 --> 01:15:39.272]  Maybe he's Mr. Limited Hangout.
[01:15:39.512 --> 01:15:47.196]  And by all means, that thing that I heard on C-SPAN two weeks ago, if I had no awareness of you, sir, I would have at least looked into you.
[01:15:47.216 --> 01:15:48.737]  Because look at the clip.
[01:15:48.837 --> 01:15:49.617]  Look at the hour.
[01:15:49.958 --> 01:15:52.539]  Mr. Lamb, who I thought was objective.
[01:15:52.759 --> 01:15:55.280]  I've been watching and listening to C-SPAN since 89.
[01:15:55.581 --> 01:15:58.322]  I have my little coloring book out with Carter, Reagan, and 80.
[01:15:58.462 --> 01:16:01.384]  I'm a little bit of a stooge that way because I thought...
[01:16:01.881 --> 01:16:06.825]  C-SPAN was truth, but really it's a very sophisticated limited hangout.
[01:16:06.845 --> 01:16:08.567]  They're not going to have certain interviews.
[01:16:08.847 --> 01:16:10.348]  They're not going to have certain authors.
[01:16:10.628 --> 01:16:12.090]  And yet they're going to spend that hour.
[01:16:12.450 --> 01:16:22.278]  And Mr. Lamb, who's supposed to be the paragon of objectivity, all the people that call him and say, thank God for C-SPAN, in some way they're saying, thank God for conditioning.
[01:16:22.298 --> 01:16:23.199]  Because it's not.
[01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:25.381]  It's not objectivity.
[01:16:25.661 --> 01:16:27.923]  It's the ultimate level of success.
[01:16:28.203 --> 01:16:31.164]  Selling your mind out to the illusion of truth.
[01:16:31.304 --> 01:16:34.285]  Well, about a year ago, Fox took over C-SPAN.
[01:16:34.325 --> 01:16:34.846]  Did you know that?
[01:16:35.806 --> 01:16:36.166]  Well, no.
[01:16:36.206 --> 01:16:36.866]  What's the data on that?
[01:16:36.986 --> 01:16:38.007]  Who bought who?
[01:16:38.627 --> 01:16:44.209]  Well, they've come in and, quote, helped with the management and some of the funding.
[01:16:44.289 --> 01:16:50.171]  But, look, C-SPAN's good because you can at least call into it, and then sometimes they censor calls.
[01:16:50.852 --> 01:16:54.513]  I've called in and said, I want to talk about this, and they go up, and then they hang up on you.
[01:16:55.393 --> 01:16:57.974]  Or we're not talking about that click and, you know, there's no topic.
[01:16:58.274 --> 01:17:14.518]  But to make it clear, they have this professor on who says that, you know, how I'm this wicked devil, basically, and Ryan Lamb has had other authors on going after me and spent other hours on me years ago and talks about me on a routine basis, admits he listened to me on the radio, knows who I am.
[01:17:14.758 --> 01:17:16.418]  They put my website up before.
[01:17:17.038 --> 01:17:17.999]  At least they've done that.
[01:17:18.359 --> 01:17:22.740]  And I called up and talked to his assistant, and she just said, look...
[01:17:24.853 --> 01:17:26.435]  We're not talking about this stuff right now.
[01:17:26.495 --> 01:17:27.295]  It's all election.
[01:17:27.335 --> 01:17:29.657]  I go, wait a minute, you just had this guy on talking about me.
[01:17:29.677 --> 01:17:30.879]  He's written a book that I'm in.
[01:17:31.219 --> 01:17:32.100]  You're putting all this out.
[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:33.181]  You talk about me all the time.
[01:17:33.221 --> 01:17:34.101]  You should have me on.
[01:17:34.322 --> 01:17:36.504]  Right, if you're supposed to be... And she said, well, not at this time.
[01:17:36.544 --> 01:17:37.424]  Well, and then I didn't think.
[01:17:37.865 --> 01:17:39.106]  I called back and left a message.
[01:17:39.486 --> 01:17:40.808]  I want to have Lamb on here then.
[01:17:40.848 --> 01:17:42.309]  I want to have a discussion with Brian Lamb.
[01:17:42.939 --> 01:17:48.240]  But even then, if you're supposed to be an objectivity forum, they're ultimately a non-equal time entity.
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:51.921]  Well, we're objective, but we'll never give you that half an hour about the Federal Reserve.
[01:17:52.182 --> 01:17:57.403]  We'll never give you that half an hour about Eustace Mullins or Anthony Sutton or Alex Jones.
[01:17:57.583 --> 01:18:01.324]  But we'll even extend that and we'll slam Alex Jones and then never let him on.
[01:18:01.704 --> 01:18:04.605]  That is the ultimate limited hangout.
[01:18:04.805 --> 01:18:10.107]  That hour bashing fest the day after I was on Coast to Coast was damage control.
[01:18:10.147 --> 01:18:10.687]  Thanks for the call.
[01:18:10.967 --> 01:18:11.147]  Sure.
[01:18:11.388 --> 01:18:18.230]  And again, it is the number one link now, two weeks into it, there at the C-SPAN website.
[01:18:19.048 --> 01:18:25.550]  They say most watched video, and right there, Michael Barkin, author of A Moron's Journey.
[01:18:25.650 --> 01:18:27.891]  I'm sorry, A Culture of Conspiracy.
[01:18:28.591 --> 01:18:30.232]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:18:30.252 --> 01:18:31.412]  I'll go to these quicker.
[01:18:31.472 --> 01:18:32.633]  I'm out of control here.
[01:18:32.973 --> 01:18:34.113]  William in Colorado.
[01:18:34.153 --> 01:18:35.113]  William, you're on the air.
[01:18:36.974 --> 01:18:37.614]  Go ahead, William.
[01:18:38.434 --> 01:18:41.615]  There's a lot of talk about needles and mandatory vaccinations today.
[01:18:42.996 --> 01:18:46.037]  And the police at checkpoints jamming needles into you lovingly.
[01:18:46.636 --> 01:18:50.478]  Oh, what we have is on the social services school side of it.
[01:18:51.638 --> 01:19:02.903]  We had a case of induced autism from a forced vaccination that they said that they were going to either throw him out of school or he needed to have the vaccinations, but they never informed the mother that she could have signed a waiver.
[01:19:03.463 --> 01:19:12.007]  Yeah, no, it's all color of law, and then it causes massive brain damage, and we have the official CDC report admitting it's doing it, but still it continues.
[01:19:12.475 --> 01:19:21.098]  Well, no, I'm pretty much hopefully not going to hijack your show right now, but to all the rest of the callers, that this might be a significant interest where this might be it.
[01:19:22.138 --> 01:19:31.842]  It's Quinton Daryl Nash, and it's the case they kidnapped him last Thursday, March 18th.
[01:19:32.422 --> 01:19:34.483]  Social services kidnapped him, and...
[01:19:36.118 --> 01:19:39.361]  I need to probably go through the break, but... Yeah, you've got to stay there.
[01:19:39.421 --> 01:19:41.423]  Now wait, they grabbed him because he didn't take the vaccine?
[01:19:41.724 --> 01:19:46.648]  No, he got autism since the vaccine, and they took him and they claimed his mother for child abuse.
[01:19:47.629 --> 01:19:48.350]  Oh, that's another thing.
[01:19:48.370 --> 01:19:51.253]  When they give you the shot and the child dies or gets sick, then they charge you.
[01:19:53.385 --> 01:19:56.866]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:19:57.126 --> 01:20:00.628]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:20:00.728 --> 01:20:04.669]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:20:04.889 --> 01:20:11.051]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:20:11.451 --> 01:20:19.374]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:20:19.774 --> 01:20:25.118]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:20:25.278 --> 01:20:29.061]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:20:29.421 --> 01:20:31.283]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:20:31.343 --> 01:20:33.505]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:20:33.745 --> 01:20:39.009]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[01:20:52.472 --> 01:20:56.055]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[01:20:56.295 --> 01:20:57.717]  If so, hope has arrived.
[01:20:58.197 --> 01:20:59.638]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[01:20:59.899 --> 01:21:05.083]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[01:21:05.443 --> 01:21:09.907]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[01:21:10.227 --> 01:21:18.875]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:20.515]  Gum disease is serious.
[01:21:20.995 --> 01:21:24.737]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[01:21:25.017 --> 01:21:31.638]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including Vitamir toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[01:21:31.978 --> 01:21:36.020]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.

[01:21:51.550 --> 01:21:52.530]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:21:52.610 --> 01:21:57.373]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:21:57.553 --> 01:22:05.356]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:22:05.616 --> 01:22:10.979]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:22:11.199 --> 01:22:18.182]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:22:18.482 --> 01:22:19.183]  We're good to go.
[01:22:19.223 --> 01:22:19.403]  I think?
[01:22:43.644 --> 01:22:45.266]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:47.508 --> 01:22:49.790]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:50.551 --> 01:22:56.056]  Whether you live in the country or simply dream about living in the country, Countryside and Small Stock Journal is the magazine for you.
[01:22:56.256 --> 01:23:03.763]  You'll learn how to make cheese, sausage, wine, soap, and more, build a cider press, a year-round greenhouse, or even your own home, raise and care for poultry,
[01:23:03.763 --> 01:23:04.243]  We'll be right back.
[01:23:29.554 --> 01:23:31.575]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents...
[01:24:00.442 --> 01:24:02.785]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:24:03.565 --> 01:24:13.716]  That's right, it's a war, and we're waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation, exposing the evil that government is engaging in for their fat cat masters.
[01:24:14.922 --> 01:24:19.843]  We'll finish up with William, then we've got Phil in England and Dennis and Jack and Joe and others.
[01:24:20.483 --> 01:24:23.364]  But, William, how do you know about this particular case?
[01:24:23.384 --> 01:24:28.225]  Because I know that a lot of this has even come out in mainstream news, the so-called shaken baby syndrome.
[01:24:28.585 --> 01:24:29.846]  They'll give the child the shot.
[01:24:30.826 --> 01:24:33.007]  It'll go into convulsions in the car on the way home.
[01:24:33.927 --> 01:24:34.387]  Die.
[01:24:35.277 --> 01:24:35.637]  We're good to go.
[01:24:35.657 --> 01:24:36.157]  We're good to go.
[01:24:56.118 --> 01:25:04.360]  And then we have the CDC's own documents where they say it's happening and they got a quote covered it up from 2000, just came out about a month ago on ABC News.
[01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:11.462]  I mean, this is real, but the government just, we want to pass laws to make you take it now because you found out how bad it is.
[01:25:12.202 --> 01:25:13.163]  Go ahead, William.
[01:25:13.643 --> 01:25:18.484]  Yeah, the Center for Disease Control article, that would be on Infowars.com.
[01:25:18.704 --> 01:25:19.905]  Oh, you found it on my website?
[01:25:20.445 --> 01:25:21.245]  No, is it on there?
[01:25:22.359 --> 01:25:23.699]  Yeah, oh, the one I just mentioned.
[01:25:23.719 --> 01:25:25.040]  Yeah, we posted it about a month ago.
[01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:26.160]  It's in there, yeah.
[01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:31.221]  CDC article, and then there was an... No, it was an ABC News article about the CDC.
[01:25:32.882 --> 01:25:40.744]  And then the NSCO document that cites the family as a disease, which document was that?
[01:25:41.404 --> 01:25:51.527]  That is the Calhoun Reader using the University of Texas, and I ended up getting the textbook, but I actually found out about it from Dr. Dennis Cuddy's book, Secret Records Revealed.
[01:25:52.316 --> 01:25:52.696]  Okay.
[01:25:53.356 --> 01:25:55.477]  Let's get back to what you called about for a second.
[01:25:55.557 --> 01:26:01.499]  Yeah, they took JoJo Nash-Connor's son March 18th from school.
[01:26:02.999 --> 01:26:04.260]  Where did you find out about this?
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:05.680]  Oh, I've been living it, sir.
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:09.761]  I've been living this for ten years, and I just, this situation for the last three weeks.
[01:26:10.021 --> 01:26:11.022]  So you know these people?
[01:26:11.522 --> 01:26:12.122]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:13.686 --> 01:26:15.707]  I mean, I've lived this for the last three weeks.
[01:26:16.207 --> 01:26:18.308]  I would have went to court yesterday, but I'm proud to have been arrested.
[01:26:18.328 --> 01:26:19.168]  Okay, fine, fine.
[01:26:19.208 --> 01:26:19.989]  Just tell the story.
[01:26:20.049 --> 01:26:24.050]  How about if I have her tell it?
[01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:24.550]  She's right here.
[01:26:24.610 --> 01:26:24.890]  Hold on.
[01:26:25.010 --> 01:26:25.971]  Her name is JoJo Nash.
[01:26:25.991 --> 01:26:27.031]  Okay.
[01:26:28.092 --> 01:26:28.532]  Good morning.
[01:26:28.992 --> 01:26:30.192]  Hey, Jo, what happened to you?
[01:26:30.432 --> 01:26:35.814]  Well, Alex, they took off with my baby after he had his vaccination.
[01:26:37.175 --> 01:26:42.377]  He had spent like seven months in a school situation with a teacher who was
[01:26:43.887 --> 01:26:44.848]  How old is the child?
[01:26:44.908 --> 01:26:45.588]  He's five.
[01:26:47.309 --> 01:26:48.970]  And so you let him give him the vaccines?
[01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:53.912]  Well, what they told me is that he had to have them or he would get suspended from school.
[01:26:53.932 --> 01:27:00.035]  That's a lie, so that's racketeering, that's color of law, that's official oppression right there.
[01:27:00.415 --> 01:27:08.179]  And so I took him in and got his shots, and boy oh boy, he was way up there.
[01:27:09.019 --> 01:27:10.320]  So what happened after he took the shots?
[01:27:11.342 --> 01:27:18.184]  He went to the school and he was being really terrible to his teachers and the kids and everybody.
[01:27:18.204 --> 01:27:20.945]  I didn't know what to do.
[01:27:20.965 --> 01:27:25.506]  And me, myself, Alex, I just went through brain surgery a year ago.
[01:27:25.566 --> 01:27:26.586]  Okay, so what happened?
[01:27:26.827 --> 01:27:27.987]  Why did they grab your child?
[01:27:28.207 --> 01:27:31.928]  Because he had a spanking and he had welts on his behind.
[01:27:34.252 --> 01:27:38.515]  Well, you know, it's not illegal to spank, but they can come after you if you leave marks.
[01:27:38.535 --> 01:27:39.656]  So, ma'am, I don't know what to say.
[01:27:39.676 --> 01:27:42.238]  I mean, you shouldn't have your child in public school, and they don't have any money.
[01:27:42.258 --> 01:27:45.681]  You had brain surgery and took the shots and acted bizarrely.
[01:27:45.741 --> 01:27:50.024]  I'm sorry that happened, and just get with some good folks in your area and learn your rights.
[01:27:50.264 --> 01:27:50.904]  Thanks for the call.
[01:27:50.924 --> 01:27:52.265]  That's really all I can say on the subject.
[01:27:53.266 --> 01:27:55.488]  Let's talk to Jack in Colorado.
[01:27:56.649 --> 01:28:00.752]  Or, no, Jack in... We'll go to Jack in Colorado in a second.
[01:28:00.872 --> 01:28:02.053]  Phil in England is up next.
[01:28:02.093 --> 01:28:02.733]  Phil, go ahead.
[01:28:03.694 --> 01:28:03.794]  Yeah.
[01:28:04.605 --> 01:28:05.225]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:28:05.585 --> 01:28:05.886]  Hello.
[01:28:06.566 --> 01:28:07.666]  Hi, how are you doing?
[01:28:07.686 --> 01:28:08.206]  Fine.
[01:28:08.727 --> 01:28:09.647]  What a show you've got today.
[01:28:10.687 --> 01:28:12.948]  First of all, I thought your guest was extremely naive.
[01:28:14.189 --> 01:28:16.350]  Oh, the guy that thinks sucking people's blood is good?
[01:28:17.110 --> 01:28:23.553]  Yeah, according to him, the world doesn't exist outside his county or state.
[01:28:24.193 --> 01:28:25.013]  He needs to wake up.
[01:28:26.414 --> 01:28:29.715]  I wanted to talk to you about the government-sponsored terrorism in Madrid.
[01:28:30.956 --> 01:28:33.437]  Classic case of problem, reaction, solution.
[01:28:35.586 --> 01:28:49.715]  At the weekend, they had an emergency meeting, Homeland Security Ministers, at which they agreed to set up a department to coordinate, sorry, a counter-terrorism czar based in Brussels.
[01:28:50.516 --> 01:28:52.457]  I'm quoting from the London Telegraph here.
[01:28:53.078 --> 01:29:05.346]  And it says, the British rights group State Watch warned that the EU is once again exploiting the terrorist crisis to extend police control over society as a whole, with Britain again leading the push for greater EU powers.
[01:29:05.785 --> 01:29:09.528]  Most surprised there, because the Blair government is the most authoritarian government ever.
[01:29:09.708 --> 01:29:10.969]  And I couldn't have said it any better.
[01:29:11.230 --> 01:29:15.193]  All this is an excuse to extend police state controls over all of us.
[01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:16.551]  Exactly.
[01:29:16.571 --> 01:29:17.391]  Stay there.
[01:29:17.832 --> 01:29:19.013]  You're making great points, Bill.
[01:29:19.033 --> 01:29:19.614]  So just stay there.
[01:29:19.674 --> 01:29:20.294]  Three-minute break.
[01:29:20.595 --> 01:29:21.435]  I know it's on your dime.
[01:29:21.455 --> 01:29:22.116]  You're calling from England.
[01:29:22.136 --> 01:29:23.137]  We'll come right back to you.
[01:29:23.718 --> 01:29:26.921]  And then we'll get to Dennis and Jack and Joe and everybody else.
[01:29:27.321 --> 01:29:28.782]  So stay with us.
[01:29:28.802 --> 01:29:29.843]  1-800-599-231.
[01:29:29.864 --> 01:29:34.128]  And I've looked at all the evidence of the Madrid bombings.
[01:29:34.788 --> 01:29:35.349]  It's clear.
[01:29:35.489 --> 01:29:36.790]  I agree with the people on the streets.
[01:29:37.071 --> 01:29:37.991]  The government did it.
[01:29:38.652 --> 01:29:39.833]  And it backfired on them.
[01:29:39.853 --> 01:29:40.514]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:44.700]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:46.781]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.701 --> 01:29:50.482]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:53.423 --> 01:29:54.984]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:29:55.124 --> 01:29:56.244]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:29:56.424 --> 01:29:59.845]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:29:59.945 --> 01:30:00.385]  Phenol.
[01:30:00.706 --> 01:30:07.768]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:30:08.668 --> 01:30:10.590]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[01:30:25.763 --> 01:30:29.185]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:30:29.325 --> 01:30:32.886]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[01:30:33.066 --> 01:30:35.467]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[01:30:35.587 --> 01:30:36.488]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:30:36.588 --> 01:30:46.332]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.
[01:30:46.532 --> 01:30:48.753]  Call Cal Bend toll free, 1-800-340-7091 or visit calbendpuresoap.com.
[01:30:53.915 --> 01:30:54.155]  I think.
[01:31:15.553 --> 01:31:22.056]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:31:22.236 --> 01:31:27.318]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:31:27.438 --> 01:31:36.321]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:31:36.581 --> 01:31:43.524]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[01:31:44.824 --> 01:31:45.265]  803-4438.
[01:31:46.845 --> 01:31:48.406]  Call now and get free shipping.
[01:31:48.626 --> 01:31:49.567]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:31:50.087 --> 01:31:55.650]  Do you know a lot about the quality of air outside these days?
[01:31:55.710 --> 01:31:56.130]  Pollution.
[01:31:56.190 --> 01:31:56.470]  Pollen.
[01:31:56.570 --> 01:31:57.691]  Is it as healthy as you'd like it?
[01:31:57.751 --> 01:31:58.131]  Allergies.
[01:31:58.271 --> 01:31:58.591]  Asthma.
[01:31:58.611 --> 01:31:59.052]  Probably not.
[01:31:59.072 --> 01:32:00.072]  Well, listen to this.
[01:32:00.292 --> 01:32:09.277]  Did you know, according to the American Lung Association, combined with the EPA, the air quality inside your home is actually 6 to 10 times worse than the air outside?
[01:32:09.297 --> 01:32:10.178]  6 to 10 times.
[01:32:10.218 --> 01:32:10.938]  Look at that BUS.
[01:32:15.878 --> 01:32:17.540]  What about all those cleaners under your sink?
[01:32:18.001 --> 01:32:20.083]  Where do you think all those fumes go?
[01:32:20.383 --> 01:32:21.785]  Well, I'll tell you where they go.
[01:32:21.825 --> 01:32:24.789]  They go into you, into your children.
[01:32:24.809 --> 01:32:26.271]  Am I scaring you?
[01:32:26.611 --> 01:32:27.512]  Remember this word.
[01:32:27.913 --> 01:32:28.653]  Puritech.
[01:32:28.673 --> 01:32:30.215]  P-U-R-I-T-E-C.
[01:32:30.275 --> 01:32:32.398]  Puritech makes the pure ear system.
[01:32:32.598 --> 01:32:32.978]  We're good to go.
[01:32:32.998 --> 01:32:33.458]  We're good to go.
[01:32:58.459 --> 01:33:00.360]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:00.841 --> 01:33:03.682]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:05.363 --> 01:33:11.627]  Alright, I'm going to force myself to go through four or five calls real quick, then cover more news for the balance of the hour.
[01:33:12.668 --> 01:33:13.568]  It's got to be done.
[01:33:14.269 --> 01:33:18.071]  But briefly, before we go back to England and talk to Phil and the important points he's making...
[01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:21.682]  Police State 3 Total Enslavement is one of my newest films.
[01:33:21.702 --> 01:33:25.725]  There's also Matrix of Evil, but Police State 3 Total Enslavement is really good.
[01:33:26.265 --> 01:33:29.467]  It's two hours and 44 minutes long.
[01:33:29.967 --> 01:33:32.209]  It's really three or four films in one.
[01:33:32.309 --> 01:33:36.152]  It covers the Total Information Awareness Network, Patriot Act 1 and 2.
[01:33:37.569 --> 01:33:50.505]  Homeland Security, forced inoculations, the government-run white slavery rings, it gets into just what the New World Order is, the first 25 minutes of it, about PNAC, who the neocons are.
[01:33:51.537 --> 01:33:52.117]  So much.
[01:33:52.217 --> 01:33:54.658]  I mean, it's really a library in and of itself.
[01:33:55.178 --> 01:33:57.938]  A film by myself, Alex Jones, Total Enslavement.
[01:33:58.279 --> 01:34:06.440]  The greatest evil that mankind has ever faced is among us, a scientifically crafted global dictatorship sworn to enslave every man, woman, and child.
[01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:12.242]  The United States government at all levels has fallen under the control of a desperately wicked New World Order clan.
[01:34:12.622 --> 01:34:13.242]  It is a clan.
[01:34:13.262 --> 01:34:13.762]  They're related.
[01:34:15.163 --> 01:34:23.474]  The events of September 11th marked the initiation of the final sick push of the Illuminati to consolidate their one world order and transform Earth into a prison planet.
[01:34:24.896 --> 01:34:30.604]  In over two and a half hours, Alex Jones, that's me, chronicles the stunning detail, the true character of the globalist.
[01:34:30.764 --> 01:34:31.005]  Learn.
[01:34:32.247 --> 01:34:39.833]  Their master plan of the bloodthirsty elite to financially, physically, and spiritually imprison not only America, but the world.
[01:34:40.313 --> 01:34:46.397]  Total Enslavement is the third installment in my critically acclaimed Police State series and is a must-see for all who love freedom.
[01:34:46.777 --> 01:34:50.340]  The film documents, again, the nightmare rise of the homeland security dictatorship.
[01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:58.184]  The Patriot Acts 1 and 2, Total Information Awareness Network, government-run white slavery rings, the new prison surveillance economy, and much more.
[01:34:58.284 --> 01:35:07.209]  The very future of humanity depends on exposing government-sponsored terrorism and how the globalist opposes our saviors when, in fact, they are the terrorists.
[01:35:08.129 --> 01:35:18.355]  And to order copies of Police State 3 Total Enslavement or Matrix of Evil or the book Order Out of Chaos or my book Descent into Tyranny or Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove...
[01:35:19.008 --> 01:35:19.768]  We're good to go.
[01:35:19.849 --> 01:35:20.109]  I think?
[01:35:38.178 --> 01:35:49.163]  South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704, or, of course, InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:50.743 --> 01:35:53.565]  And the videos are $25.95 apiece.
[01:35:54.225 --> 01:35:59.507]  $20 when you order three or more of any of the books or videos.
[01:35:59.547 --> 01:36:01.228]  Well, any of the videos, they drop down to $20.
[01:36:01.548 --> 01:36:02.708]  You order three or more.
[01:36:02.768 --> 01:36:04.069]  The books are from between...
[01:36:05.273 --> 01:36:10.475]  You know, $5 to $25, depending on how big the book is and how much information's in it.
[01:36:10.535 --> 01:36:12.756]  But a lot of key info there for you.
[01:36:13.116 --> 01:36:14.437]  I hope you'll take advantage of it.
[01:36:14.877 --> 01:36:16.218]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:36:16.298 --> 01:36:17.518]  Phil in England, thanks for holding.
[01:36:18.018 --> 01:36:22.400]  Go ahead, you're making your point about them using the Madrid bombing to expand their tyranny.
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:27.382]  I mean, China uses the example of 9-11 to crack down there against Christians.
[01:36:27.542 --> 01:36:32.304]  Worldwide, governments are intensifying the enslavement.
[01:36:32.324 --> 01:36:32.664]  Go ahead.
[01:36:33.666 --> 01:36:36.427]  Well, we're now at the reaction and the solutions.
[01:36:37.067 --> 01:36:38.847]  You know, we can see the event more clearly.
[01:36:39.948 --> 01:36:40.988]  Now it's been a week or two.
[01:36:41.948 --> 01:36:44.229]  They're proposing to set up a new department.
[01:36:44.329 --> 01:36:52.711]  I'm quoting from the London Telegraph article on Sunday, which says, the new department will be an analysis centre lodged at the EU's military staff headquarters.
[01:36:53.371 --> 01:36:56.692]  Critics say it will duplicate the work of Europol in The Hague.
[01:36:57.133 --> 01:37:01.194]  You can see the blurring of lines between military and police.
[01:37:01.814 --> 01:37:02.454]  It's a police state.
[01:37:05.445 --> 01:37:10.368]  And your police chief in London says he wants to put troops on the streets, get ready for martial law.
[01:37:10.528 --> 01:37:11.929]  Our top generals are saying it.
[01:37:12.189 --> 01:37:12.890]  They just love it.
[01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:14.070]  They're going to be our masters.
[01:37:14.531 --> 01:37:15.971]  This is what happens in history.
[01:37:16.252 --> 01:37:17.132]  This is the norm.
[01:37:17.192 --> 01:37:18.133]  It's happening again.
[01:37:18.153 --> 01:37:23.716]  Are the yuppies or the middle class people starting to get it in England, or are they just loving all this?
[01:37:24.436 --> 01:37:33.802]  Well, I think it was Paul Watson who said on Monday that there's a huge generational gap between the young and brainwashed and those who are older.
[01:37:34.478 --> 01:37:36.079]  And can see it more clearly.
[01:37:37.539 --> 01:37:42.840]  I mean, you know, you've got the mindless drones who just watch MTV all day and they don't know what's going on.
[01:37:43.861 --> 01:37:47.462]  But those who do care to look, who do care to see, you know, are waking up.
[01:37:49.042 --> 01:38:01.626]  I wanted to thank you as well for the show and also thank GCN as well for putting this on the internet, your show on the internet, because it's a global awakening that's happening and they deserve some credit.
[01:38:02.105 --> 01:38:06.708]  Well, for every action, there's an equal or greater reaction.
[01:38:07.429 --> 01:38:15.134]  And as they move ahead with global tyranny, globally, God is moving into the human spirit to really cause an awakening.
[01:38:15.215 --> 01:38:17.076]  And I don't just say that as a cheerleader.
[01:38:17.656 --> 01:38:18.397]  I can't believe...
[01:38:19.085 --> 01:38:22.626]  Just the grassroots, instinctive wake-up that's happening.
[01:38:22.826 --> 01:38:26.647]  But everybody feels like they're alone because we're all balkanized into tiny pieces.
[01:38:27.007 --> 01:38:31.148]  We've got to start getting out, talking, starting organizations, being leaders.
[01:38:31.628 --> 01:38:33.868]  That's where the victory lies, is you.
[01:38:34.268 --> 01:38:34.908]  That's you.
[01:38:34.948 --> 01:38:36.409]  I'm talking to everybody out there.
[01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:37.809]  Look in the mirror.
[01:38:38.049 --> 01:38:39.129]  That's where the solution is.
[01:38:39.369 --> 01:38:40.010]  Thanks for the call.
[01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:41.950]  I appreciate that call.
[01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:43.690]  Let's go ahead and take another one.
[01:38:43.710 --> 01:38:44.931]  Dennis in Arkansas, go ahead.
[01:38:44.951 --> 01:38:46.651]  Yes, Alex.
[01:38:47.389 --> 01:38:47.609]  Yes.
[01:38:48.189 --> 01:38:52.512]  You were talking about this gas price going up here not too long ago.
[01:38:52.572 --> 01:38:59.515]  I was watching on your Communist News Network, and Walmart was number one when it comes to profits, and Exxon and Mobil was number two.
[01:39:00.444 --> 01:39:03.426]  They broke that down into what happens to a gallon of gasoline.
[01:39:26.279 --> 01:39:29.201]  Spencer Abraham... That's exactly who I wanted to talk about.
[01:39:29.221 --> 01:39:30.102]  ...got before the Congress.
[01:39:30.142 --> 01:39:30.922]  I got his quotes here.
[01:39:30.963 --> 01:39:31.943]  They're stunning.
[01:39:32.283 --> 01:39:35.245]  And he said, look, we're not going to get into the reserves.
[01:39:35.386 --> 01:39:36.726]  We're not going to do more drilling.
[01:39:36.746 --> 01:39:38.127]  You're not going to go into Alaska.
[01:39:38.648 --> 01:39:40.289]  And we don't care if the Arabs do this.
[01:39:40.309 --> 01:39:41.269]  We're not going to beg.
[01:39:41.310 --> 01:39:43.831]  Now, it's a pride thing, as if the Arabs are doing it.
[01:39:43.991 --> 01:39:50.676]  Well, number one, his dad immigrated from that part of the country anyhow.
[01:39:51.311 --> 01:39:52.572]  That's right, he's Mr. Oil.
[01:39:52.792 --> 01:39:59.138]  That's right, and his fax number is... Well, he's not gallivanting around with Hamas people, but see, he's okay, because he's a neocon.
[01:39:59.438 --> 01:40:05.143]  And if your folks out here in the listening audience want to fax him and start lodging complaints, his fax number is 202...
[01:40:06.442 --> 01:40:06.702]  586-4403.
[01:40:07.462 --> 01:40:11.383]  Oh, you've been faxing his lordship.
[01:40:11.783 --> 01:40:14.723]  And then if you want to write to him, it's U.S.
[01:40:14.743 --> 01:40:18.704]  Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, Southwest, Washington, D.C., 20585.
[01:40:21.084 --> 01:40:22.625]  You know what this is?
[01:40:22.925 --> 01:40:30.926]  Sir, this is mass looting, $1.2 trillion missing from the Pentagon, no bids allowed with Halliburton, you know, running around foaming at the mouth.
[01:40:30.986 --> 01:40:35.687]  They are raping everything, mass criminality, raping us over the gas.
[01:40:36.087 --> 01:40:39.649]  When there's more fuel than ever, and these idiots are buying it.
[01:40:39.969 --> 01:40:44.392]  And I just wished all the people would start faxing him and writing him letters and saying, we've had enough.
[01:40:44.972 --> 01:40:46.513]  And you're talking about drawing blood.
[01:40:46.693 --> 01:40:49.615]  I wonder what these police officers would do on the side of the road.
[01:40:50.516 --> 01:40:51.216]  I've thought about it.
[01:40:51.256 --> 01:40:53.758]  When I get out of the car, if they ever want to draw blood, I'll say, go ahead.
[01:40:53.778 --> 01:40:55.839]  I've got hepatitis D and a full-blown AIDS.
[01:40:56.119 --> 01:40:57.320]  Would they still want to take the blood?
[01:40:57.340 --> 01:40:58.781]  Well, that's another thing, too.
[01:40:58.821 --> 01:41:00.322]  I mean, the police aren't trained for this.
[01:41:01.082 --> 01:41:04.304]  See, it starts out in the jails, then it's on the side of the road.
[01:41:04.324 --> 01:41:05.565]  It's just craziness.
[01:41:06.167 --> 01:41:06.767]  Thanks for the call.
[01:41:06.807 --> 01:41:07.467]  Good to hear from you.
[01:41:08.128 --> 01:41:12.109]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:41:12.129 --> 01:41:14.369]  Let's talk to Jack in Colorado.
[01:41:14.389 --> 01:41:14.769]  Go ahead.
[01:41:14.789 --> 01:41:15.770]  Hello?
[01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:16.630]  Hello, sir.
[01:41:17.930 --> 01:41:24.452]  I'm calling because I just recently went to court for running a green light, and the cops denied everything.
[01:41:26.272 --> 01:41:29.533]  Oh, you didn't know they teach police officially how to lie on the stand?
[01:41:30.893 --> 01:41:31.494]  I didn't know.
[01:41:31.694 --> 01:41:32.994]  It's called liifying.
[01:41:34.105 --> 01:41:38.287]  Yeah, and see, the... They don't testify, they liify.
[01:41:39.427 --> 01:41:40.748]  Yeah, it was disgusting.
[01:41:41.188 --> 01:41:49.931]  And see, I slipped and said that he was lying, and that's when she screamed out, you're guilty, and she fined me.
[01:41:50.151 --> 01:41:51.752]  Well, you should have demanded a jury trial.
[01:41:52.842 --> 01:41:53.642]  I probably should have.
[01:41:54.122 --> 01:41:56.283]  But it was my last chance.
[01:41:56.323 --> 01:42:02.224]  Hey, hey, she's the authority, the official, your lord.
[01:42:03.424 --> 01:42:03.924]  I believe you.
[01:42:03.944 --> 01:42:07.625]  But see, what he stopped me for was one of those checkpoints for a DUI.
[01:42:08.365 --> 01:42:10.085]  And he'd even denied that.
[01:42:10.105 --> 01:42:13.086]  He even denied stopping me for a DUI.
[01:42:13.146 --> 01:42:15.807]  I mean, he even tested me and the whole thing.
[01:42:16.007 --> 01:42:17.347]  Sir, I've watched them lie.
[01:42:17.387 --> 01:42:18.407]  They're congenital liars.
[01:42:18.427 --> 01:42:21.948]  I'm not saying all of them, but the system encourages the liars and promotes them.
[01:42:22.168 --> 01:42:22.408]  I know.
[01:42:23.214 --> 01:42:24.716]  Okay, so I'll just tell you quickly.
[01:42:25.437 --> 01:42:27.559]  They're recording people there now, too.
[01:42:29.061 --> 01:42:35.528]  And when I was standing in line to get through those metal detectors, it was all Hispanic people.
[01:42:35.768 --> 01:42:41.515]  So, you know, I don't understand why this is going on, because...
[01:42:42.508 --> 01:42:44.909]  I listened to some of the people that were ahead of me.
[01:42:46.309 --> 01:42:56.311]  They do feed on, especially immigrants, and we're going to see open borders, but they do feed on them a lot with the tickets because they don't resist.
[01:42:58.152 --> 01:43:04.033]  This girl that was in front of me, she was Hispanic too and not from this country.
[01:43:04.854 --> 01:43:09.755]  The judge was asking her if she needed an interpreter and she also asked her...
[01:43:11.340 --> 01:43:15.714]  Apparently she didn't have any car insurance when she was involved in this accident.
[01:43:16.152 --> 01:43:19.393]  And she didn't get, she wasn't charged with anything for that.
[01:43:20.013 --> 01:43:25.215]  And again, they arrest them and they pay the fines, but on the other side of the coin, oh yeah, they don't have to have insurance.
[01:43:25.255 --> 01:43:25.855]  Thanks for the call.
[01:43:25.875 --> 01:43:27.416]  It's major discrimination.
[01:43:27.456 --> 01:43:28.036]  I appreciate it.
[01:43:28.076 --> 01:43:28.877]  I know it's wrong.
[01:43:29.177 --> 01:43:31.497]  But see, that's, the people listening today don't believe us.
[01:43:31.798 --> 01:43:35.359]  When it happens to them next month or next year, that's when the seeds sprout.
[01:43:35.499 --> 01:43:41.381]  See, we put the seeds out, and the tyranny is the rain and the sunshine for it, and it grows it up.
[01:43:42.357 --> 01:43:43.938]  Thanks for the call.
[01:43:44.278 --> 01:43:44.898]  I appreciate it.
[01:43:45.178 --> 01:43:46.879]  Let's go ahead and take another one.
[01:43:48.019 --> 01:43:49.780]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Indiana.
[01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:51.180]  Go ahead, Joe.
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:53.281]  God bless you and all your hard work, Alex.
[01:43:54.181 --> 01:43:56.282]  We've been listening to you for about seven years.
[01:43:56.702 --> 01:43:57.282]  Well, thank you.
[01:43:57.522 --> 01:43:59.323]  When we first started out, we were kind of skeptical.
[01:44:01.027 --> 01:44:03.908]  I'm not quite like Christ, but we almost worship you.
[01:44:04.208 --> 01:44:04.968]  No, please.
[01:44:05.308 --> 01:44:06.669]  No, I'm just an average guy.
[01:44:06.689 --> 01:44:11.710]  Well, yeah, you're an average guy with the kahunas to stand up and speak for what's right.
[01:44:11.770 --> 01:44:16.632]  What I'm calling about, I don't want to call him a police officer.
[01:44:16.692 --> 01:44:19.813]  I guess I'll call him Barney Fife instead of calling him a jerk.
[01:44:19.853 --> 01:44:21.333]  Well, I just did.
[01:44:21.373 --> 01:44:21.893]  Shame on me.
[01:44:22.353 --> 01:44:25.734]  Well, anyways, he was talking about he didn't know this and he didn't know that.
[01:44:25.794 --> 01:44:27.735]  There was national media coverage.
[01:44:28.510 --> 01:44:42.474]  About a college student here in Indiana that at some wee hours of the morning was knocking on the wrong door and an untrained, I believe it was a Ball State police officer, shot that boy dead.
[01:44:43.335 --> 01:44:44.475]  That boy was unarmed.
[01:44:44.975 --> 01:44:46.175]  Oh, that was the trick-or-treating.
[01:44:47.416 --> 01:44:52.037]  Okay, I wasn't sure of the exact situation.
[01:44:52.257 --> 01:44:53.338]  There's a bunch of these cases.
[01:44:53.418 --> 01:44:56.119]  They're trained to kill, and they're like ravenous dogs.
[01:44:56.199 --> 01:44:57.459]  Yeah, shot the man dead.
[01:44:58.468 --> 01:45:06.575]  And, you know, he was totally unarmed, and he was poorly trained, so they're going to retrain him and put him back out on the street.
[01:45:07.496 --> 01:45:13.201]  Maybe next time he'll be able to shoot him from a further distance, or they'll train him to put a weapon on him or whatever.
[01:45:13.802 --> 01:45:19.166]  And I'm also dealing with the school corporation down here in the town I live in.
[01:45:19.406 --> 01:45:23.350]  I'll leave their name out of it for now until I figure out what my attorney's going to do, but...
[01:45:23.917 --> 01:45:30.201]  I guess it's okay for our teachers to fondle our children, and they just call that battery when they get back in a corner.
[01:45:30.241 --> 01:45:31.442]  Just a simple misdemeanor battery.
[01:45:31.482 --> 01:45:35.685]  All over the country, they have police stripping young girls in front of classes.
[01:45:35.745 --> 01:45:39.107]  I have articles on that, and nothing's being done.
[01:45:39.147 --> 01:45:42.009]  They do sexual examinations of elementary school students.
[01:45:42.029 --> 01:45:43.950]  They're putting cameras in the bathrooms.
[01:45:44.050 --> 01:45:47.512]  I mean, it's just worse than 1984, sir.
[01:45:47.892 --> 01:45:48.593]  Yes, it is.
[01:45:50.034 --> 01:45:51.615]  It's outrageous, but like I said, I...
[01:45:53.028 --> 01:45:56.470]  I'm in the process of getting a victory on my end.
[01:45:57.470 --> 01:45:58.871]  Good, good.
[01:45:58.891 --> 01:45:59.731]  Prosecute them.
[01:46:00.112 --> 01:46:00.792]  Expose them.
[01:46:00.872 --> 01:46:01.732]  Picket the school.
[01:46:02.293 --> 01:46:02.993]  Just expose them.
[01:46:03.013 --> 01:46:03.753]  Good to hear from you.
[01:46:04.154 --> 01:46:05.874]  And tell us as it develops what happens.
[01:46:06.755 --> 01:46:07.975]  I know we have loaded phone lines.
[01:46:07.995 --> 01:46:08.696]  We'll get to your calls.
[01:46:08.796 --> 01:46:10.397]  I just want to cover some news right now.
[01:46:10.437 --> 01:46:11.037]  We've got to do this.
[01:46:12.305 --> 01:46:12.645]  U.S.
[01:46:12.705 --> 01:46:14.827]  petrol prices at all-time high, BBC.
[01:46:14.867 --> 01:46:21.612]  Americans are paying more at the pump for their petrol than ever, thanks to the remorseless rise in oil prices, a study has found.
[01:46:21.672 --> 01:46:29.999]  Again, OPEC said they were going to raise prices last year, since the oil company's making the profits, and the government won't go on the Strategic Reserve, won't open up ANWR.
[01:46:30.039 --> 01:46:37.745]  You notice Bush is in, has the House, the Senate, the Supreme Court, the Executive, everything, and they're not letting you have the oil from ANWR.
[01:46:38.606 --> 01:46:40.187]  They'll run the country for 100 years, by the way.
[01:46:41.522 --> 01:46:42.762]  The AAA, a U.S.
[01:46:42.802 --> 01:46:46.584]  monitoring organization, says prices now average almost $1.74 a gallon.
[01:46:46.964 --> 01:46:47.404]  I've read $2.
[01:46:48.584 --> 01:46:50.565]  And out in California, it's upwards of $3.
[01:46:51.786 --> 01:46:53.546]  In many areas of the country, it's soared to $2.69 in the east.
[01:46:56.700 --> 01:46:57.241]  Here's another one.
[01:46:57.261 --> 01:46:57.581]  The U.S.
[01:46:57.621 --> 01:47:01.744]  says FTAA January 2005 deadline still on course.
[01:47:01.844 --> 01:47:04.145]  Forbes magazine, a top-level U.S.
[01:47:04.185 --> 01:47:14.852]  trade official, said Tuesday that some progress was made in recent informal talks to overcome an impasse in negotiations to craft a free trade agreement covering 34 countries in the Western Hemisphere.
[01:47:15.132 --> 01:47:18.495]  And I've read the synopsis of the agreement they're signing.
[01:47:18.935 --> 01:47:23.398]  The third world doesn't have to give their sovereignty up, just America and Canada.
[01:47:25.556 --> 01:47:28.419]  So that's globalism right there.
[01:47:28.759 --> 01:47:31.441]  Russian nuclear warship ready to blow the register.
[01:47:32.342 --> 01:47:38.708]  The nuclear-powered Russian warship has been ordered back to port amid fears it could, quote, go sky-high at any minute.
[01:47:39.477 --> 01:47:55.290]  That, at least, is the opinion of Admiral Vladimir Kriendov, who said the Peter the Great and those places on board where the admirals actually go, everything's fine, but where they don't go, everything is such a state that it could go sky-high any minute.
[01:47:56.010 --> 01:48:05.258]  And the admirals made the decision to dispatch the flagship of Russia's northern fleet back to port for immediate repairs last Wednesday during exercises in the Barents Sea.
[01:48:06.659 --> 01:48:10.583]  They say it could have a nuclear meltdown and explode any minute.
[01:48:10.603 --> 01:48:13.867]  9-11 NORAD issue addressed in Rumsfeld testimony.
[01:48:13.887 --> 01:48:16.410]  We have the video clip at prisonplanet.com.
[01:48:21.212 --> 01:48:27.698]  When he was confronted by one of the whitewashers on the commission, he confessed that planes are supposed to be sent up to intercept hijacked planes.
[01:48:28.278 --> 01:48:36.125]  The inference here is that they were sent up on 9-11 and that a shoot-down order was issued, but that the pilot did not receive the said order.
[01:48:37.473 --> 01:48:38.494]  That's some news, man.
[01:48:38.855 --> 01:48:39.556]  This is huge.
[01:48:39.616 --> 01:48:50.470]  This means somebody either deliberately did not convey that order, that there was a huge, colossal mess-up, extremely unlikely given the severity of the circumstances, or a stand-up order was issued by someone.
[01:48:50.510 --> 01:48:51.512]  We know that to be Dick Cheney.
[01:48:51.972 --> 01:48:54.494]  Rumsfeld just gave the whole thing up, and he knew it.
[01:48:54.834 --> 01:48:58.716]  He looked sick, and if I'm not mistaken, his hands were actually shaking.
[01:48:59.176 --> 01:49:07.441]  Joint Chiefs of Staff Myers tried to join in to help, but was not much use, and he looked freaked out too.
[01:49:08.061 --> 01:49:09.522]  By the way, I saw this online.
[01:49:09.562 --> 01:49:10.543]  We didn't get it recorded.
[01:49:10.703 --> 01:49:19.328]  I'm begging you, when it re-airs, if I miss it, or if you've already taped it, please mail it to us, folks.
[01:49:20.037 --> 01:49:23.678]  This is, I saw it online, shaking, freaking out.
[01:49:24.278 --> 01:49:26.319]  I mean, total guilt, just spewing.
[01:49:26.699 --> 01:49:28.380]  We know from the facts they did it.
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:37.743]  But at the same time, just to, and of course, General Myers is now the chairman, joins his staff, and he's the governor who did the stand down that day.
[01:49:39.223 --> 01:49:45.506]  Continuing, next hour I'll get more into this big stack of 9-11 whitewash.
[01:49:45.526 --> 01:49:46.466]  I want to cover some of the...
[01:49:47.583 --> 01:49:51.265]  Big Brother news right now that's really, really important.
[01:49:52.805 --> 01:49:56.707]  And then we'll get into 9-11 and take more of your calls coming up.
[01:49:56.767 --> 01:50:03.170]  But this story out of the Chicago Sun-Times, Homeland Security liaison, to help keep Hollywood in line.
[01:50:03.310 --> 01:50:04.111]  That's the headline.
[01:50:04.151 --> 01:50:15.496]  You know, the government, when it's not producing $70 million packages of fake newscasts that have been airing all over the place of how wonderful the government is, fake newscasts, that's now admitted, they're doing this.
[01:50:16.491 --> 01:50:22.753]  Protecting Americans against terror attacks and other disasters requires strong interagency communication and superior intelligence gathering.
[01:50:23.253 --> 01:50:24.753]  Oh, and a little help from Hollywood.
[01:50:25.334 --> 01:50:30.695]  The Homeland Security Department has posted a job for a liaison to the entertainment industry.
[01:50:30.715 --> 01:50:34.376]  The salary could be as high as $136,000 plus benefits.
[01:50:34.476 --> 01:50:40.938]  Well, I have AP articles from two and a half years ago where Karl Rove and Card and others and Shetland
[01:50:42.145 --> 01:50:47.108]  Lionel Chetwin went to Hollywood and told them, don't criticize the government.
[01:50:47.508 --> 01:50:57.875]  Then he had all these shows about how torture's good and the CIA loves you and... Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:58.075 --> 01:51:02.498]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:51:02.638 --> 01:51:07.021]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:51:07.061 --> 01:51:08.402]  The New World Order...
[01:51:10.183 --> 01:51:14.408]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:51:14.468 --> 01:51:21.396]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:51:21.536 --> 01:51:23.559]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:51:23.899 --> 01:51:24.239]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:51:24.279 --> 01:51:25.700]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:51:53.072 --> 01:51:57.676]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[01:51:57.896 --> 01:52:02.340]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:16.533]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey light water purifier, an LED base, two Berkey sport filtration bottles, the Berkey battery adapter, the Berkey MP solar charger, as well as a backup set of two black Berkey purification elements.
[01:52:16.653 --> 01:52:19.374]  Get the one-stop solution for your emergency and everyday needs.
[01:52:19.394 --> 01:52:20.454]  The Berkey Security Pack.
[01:52:20.514 --> 01:52:21.854]  A retail value of $518 for only $399.
[01:52:45.461 --> 01:52:46.241]  We're good to go.
[01:53:09.346 --> 01:53:10.006]  We're good to go.
[01:53:38.863 --> 01:53:41.964]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:53:42.124 --> 01:53:56.091]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:53:56.151 --> 01:54:02.193]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:54:02.794 --> 01:54:05.775]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:09.742 --> 01:54:19.208]  Now, again, you already have propaganda placement, the government paying for anti-gun, pro, you know, join the military statements.
[01:54:19.348 --> 01:54:20.408]  I mean, it's paid for.
[01:54:20.488 --> 01:54:21.649]  Fake newscasts, all of it.
[01:54:23.530 --> 01:54:33.096]  And this article out of the Chicago Sun-Times admits, quote, there can be tremendous impact on the public with the ability to communicate to people what we're doing, Murphy said.
[01:54:33.136 --> 01:54:34.696]  They're going to do their movie.
[01:54:35.017 --> 01:54:35.437]  We just...
[01:54:36.084 --> 01:54:38.845]  We don't want to be silly, whatever.
[01:54:39.286 --> 01:54:40.866]  We just don't want to be silly.
[01:54:41.367 --> 01:54:53.073]  The FBI has been aided by many dramatic portrayals, among them actor Robert Stack as heroic FBI agent Elliot Ness in the television series The Untouchables, which you are untouchable.
[01:54:53.133 --> 01:54:54.533]  All crimes committed, you enjoy it.
[01:54:55.134 --> 01:55:01.637]  The actress Jodie Foster's determined agent in training, Clarice Starling, in the film The Silence of the Lambs.
[01:55:02.521 --> 01:55:03.322]  Which they've been helping.
[01:55:27.535 --> 01:55:32.577]  The last year, the department has been inundated with requests for help on motion pictures and documentaries.
[01:55:33.017 --> 01:55:39.160]  Folksman Tisa Scaloni has said, oh, they contact them and want help.
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:40.440]  That's why they fund them.
[01:55:40.981 --> 01:55:45.803]  Movies and TV shows could be recruiting tools for people considered a career in Homeland Security.
[01:55:46.303 --> 01:55:53.386]  Well, yeah, one of the big hosts in the Oscars, there was a big article about it.
[01:55:53.446 --> 01:55:55.607]  She's on the website recruiting for the CIA.
[01:55:56.519 --> 01:56:04.225]  The CIA recently began airing recruitment ads starring Jennifer Garner, who plays a CIA agent in ABC series Alias.
[01:56:05.226 --> 01:56:06.467]  And it gets worse and worse.
[01:56:06.507 --> 01:56:11.912]  Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge is aware of the entertainment industry's effect on the department's image, and it goes on and on.
[01:56:11.972 --> 01:56:19.098]  While in Los Angeles, he met with the entertainment executives who asked him how they can help the Homeland effort.
[01:56:19.518 --> 01:56:21.640]  How they can help the Fuhrer with the Reich.
[01:56:22.717 --> 01:56:28.899]  And Ridge suggested they could promote the Department's Ready campaign to educate citizens on how to prepare for a terrorist attack.
[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:34.081]  And they tell us, grovel, give all your liberties up, that's how you prepare for an attack.
[01:56:35.101 --> 01:56:36.682]  Let's just run through some of what's coming up.
[01:56:36.902 --> 01:56:38.922]  Government will track ID card use.
[01:56:39.343 --> 01:56:40.443]  That's right, it's to track you.
[01:56:41.626 --> 01:56:46.611]  NEC Demos Big Brother Biometric Phone Booth, where you have to thumb scan to use the phone booth.
[01:56:47.071 --> 01:56:49.413]  High school students offered rewards to stop crime.
[01:56:49.873 --> 01:56:52.075]  Tell us about Mommy and Daddy Extra Cash Bonuses.
[01:56:52.576 --> 01:56:53.636]  I have video of this, by the way.
[01:56:54.097 --> 01:56:58.921]  Cameras to Guard New City Parks, and it says people have a new patron in the park, Big Brother.
[01:56:59.201 --> 01:57:00.142]  Big Brother's now good.
[01:57:00.202 --> 01:57:02.124]  Every day I see an article where Big Brother is a good thing.
[01:57:02.944 --> 01:57:04.285]  Israel to Kill in U.S.
[01:57:04.405 --> 01:57:05.146]  Allied Nations.
[01:57:05.186 --> 01:57:07.388]  I thought I'd go back over this because people don't believe it.
[01:57:07.808 --> 01:57:08.349]  UPI.
[01:57:09.423 --> 01:57:10.503]  Big brother on the bus.
[01:57:10.864 --> 01:57:13.424]  More about satellite tracking and thumb scanning school children.
[01:57:14.405 --> 01:57:17.466]  No disciplinary action taken yet in strip search incident.
[01:57:18.126 --> 01:57:20.687]  And this is out of the Times-Shamrock Communications.
[01:57:20.727 --> 01:57:22.548]  All the folks that used to own KJFK I was on.
[01:57:22.568 --> 01:57:35.112]  It says, no disciplinary action has been taken yet against two Mount Carmel Township police officers and two Mount Carmel area school district employees involved in a strip search earlier this month during a high school gym class.
[01:57:35.132 --> 01:57:36.052]  This happens all the time.
[01:57:36.112 --> 01:57:37.613]  I see this story every couple days.
[01:57:38.391 --> 01:57:52.398]  On Monday morning, Mount Carmel Area Superintendent Richard Berschmitt said physical and education teacher and high school nurse Ruth Gregory had not been disciplined thus far in connection with the March 9th incident.
[01:57:53.958 --> 01:57:55.959]  And boy, this story is a horror story.
[01:57:57.100 --> 01:58:01.302]  They took the six girls inside a... I don't even want to go on, folks, what they did.
[01:58:02.082 --> 01:58:06.384]  But this is your loving government training you that you're absolute slaves.
[01:58:07.112 --> 01:58:09.053]  Less rights than a black slave in 1830.
[01:58:09.193 --> 01:58:12.094]  I mean, it's really getting to that point.
[01:58:13.795 --> 01:58:15.956]  And also, police to get more spy devices.
[01:58:15.996 --> 01:58:16.856]  Wait to hear about that.
[01:58:17.597 --> 01:58:18.217]  Some good news.
[01:58:18.357 --> 01:58:21.499]  Maine House okays Hutton's call to change the Patriot Act.
[01:58:23.099 --> 01:58:24.860]  I never really got to this properly yesterday.
[01:58:24.940 --> 01:58:27.041]  Convoy of Illegals provides a rundown.
[01:58:27.201 --> 01:58:28.342]  Agents, I want to go over that.
[01:58:29.182 --> 01:58:30.222]  Oh, there's so much more.

[01:58:39.574 --> 01:58:40.715]  Please stay with us.
[01:58:44.098 --> 01:58:54.827]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:58:55.007 --> 01:59:02.594]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:59:02.834 --> 01:59:05.979]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:59:06.239 --> 01:59:11.988]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:59:12.269 --> 01:59:18.438]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:59:18.778 --> 01:59:22.662]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:59:22.722 --> 01:59:24.624]  The water level is always visible.
[01:59:24.804 --> 01:59:30.749]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:59:30.989 --> 01:59:34.933]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:59:34.953 --> 01:59:35.514]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:59:50.223 --> 01:59:50.884]  Big Brother.
[01:59:51.524 --> 01:59:52.645]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:53.306 --> 01:59:54.447]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:54.467 --> 01:59:55.908]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.648 --> 01:59:57.509]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.529 --> 02:00:01.852]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.392 --> 02:00:06.515]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:07.676 --> 02:00:09.237]  Let's not waste any time.
[02:00:09.418 --> 02:00:12.940]  Giant news blitzes coming up and recaps of top stories.
[02:00:14.701 --> 02:00:16.603]  A Big Brother report on what they're up to.
[02:00:18.172 --> 02:00:19.973]  Right now, let's go back to your calls.
[02:00:20.033 --> 02:00:23.335]  Let's talk to Dennis in Kansas City.
[02:00:23.375 --> 02:00:24.555]  Can't seem to get my states right.
[02:00:25.295 --> 02:00:26.276]  Dennis, good to talk to you.
[02:00:26.556 --> 02:00:27.216]  They're in Missouri.
[02:00:27.837 --> 02:00:29.698]  I just wanted to tell you good news.
[02:00:30.058 --> 02:00:33.759]  The Kansas City passed a resolution against the Patriot Act.
[02:00:34.680 --> 02:00:35.520]  I heard about it.
[02:00:35.660 --> 02:00:41.183]  I went to one of those big rallies that they had, like you went to, like a peace rally or whatever.
[02:00:41.986 --> 02:00:53.109]  And they announced it, and I guess it's the proof in the Kansas City Star, but I don't take the Star, so... It's... If it would pass here, it would pass anywhere.
[02:00:53.129 --> 02:00:55.930]  I can promise you in the country... Dallas threw it out.
[02:00:56.170 --> 02:00:57.810]  Cities and towns everywhere.
[02:00:57.870 --> 02:01:05.132]  If you confront the city council with Section 802 that were all terrorists under it, all suspected misdemeanors, no Bill of Rights...
[02:01:06.072 --> 02:01:06.892]  Secret arrest.
[02:01:07.292 --> 02:01:09.953]  When you show it to them, they have to throw it out.
[02:01:10.013 --> 02:01:11.813]  You say, do you support the Constitution?
[02:01:12.113 --> 02:01:13.494]  Is America still America?
[02:01:14.014 --> 02:01:16.994]  And I quit counting at 403 states.
[02:01:17.454 --> 02:01:19.595]  Now it looks like two other states are about to do it.
[02:01:20.335 --> 02:01:21.175]  That was months ago.
[02:01:21.215 --> 02:01:22.075]  It's well over 400.
[02:01:22.415 --> 02:01:26.456]  The news still reports 145 cities, and that was a year ago.
[02:01:26.576 --> 02:01:31.317]  Well, it failed the first time, but the second time they did it, I guess...
[02:01:33.033 --> 02:01:34.575]  I'm going to be honest with you, though.
[02:01:34.615 --> 02:01:41.144]  They're still implementing it in most areas, but at least they're publicly having to say they're repudiating it.
[02:01:41.184 --> 02:01:42.205]  That shows the pressure.
[02:01:43.507 --> 02:01:44.308]  Well, like I said...
[02:01:46.092 --> 02:01:47.794]  You know, that's good news for here.
[02:01:50.156 --> 02:01:50.996]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:01:51.016 --> 02:01:54.079]  It would be about like New York trying to throw it out.
[02:01:54.119 --> 02:01:54.820]  New York did.
[02:01:55.140 --> 02:01:57.001]  I know, so that ought to make you feel better.
[02:01:57.382 --> 02:01:57.862]  Thank you.
[02:01:58.683 --> 02:01:59.684]  Hey, good to hear from you.
[02:01:59.724 --> 02:02:00.264]  Great points.
[02:02:00.565 --> 02:02:01.565]  I appreciate that, Dennis.
[02:02:02.026 --> 02:02:04.048]  Let's talk to Sandra in New Jersey.
[02:02:04.088 --> 02:02:04.908]  Sandra, go ahead.
[02:02:05.989 --> 02:02:06.670]  Hello, Alex.
[02:02:07.110 --> 02:02:07.671]  Hi.
[02:02:08.772 --> 02:02:13.756]  I was one of the people who called on the morning that Mr. Forkin was on PSTN.
[02:02:14.238 --> 02:02:16.600]  And I proceeded to ask him a few questions.
[02:02:16.700 --> 02:02:18.221]  Okay, for those that don't know, recap.
[02:02:18.841 --> 02:02:22.944]  Two weeks later, it is still the top story on C-SPAN.
[02:02:23.384 --> 02:02:26.006]  They say it is their most visited, most watched story.
[02:02:26.707 --> 02:02:29.208]  That's on the main page of C-SPAN.org right now.
[02:02:30.029 --> 02:02:34.952]  Their hit piece on me, and I've called their office, and they're not going to be interviewing me at this time.
[02:02:34.973 --> 02:02:36.013]  People need to keep calling them.
[02:02:36.033 --> 02:02:36.393]  Go ahead.
[02:02:37.274 --> 02:02:39.195]  Oh, well, I'm waiting for you to get on there.
[02:02:39.235 --> 02:02:41.817]  But anyways, I asked him a few questions about 9-1-1.
[02:02:43.454 --> 02:02:51.098]  And he proceeded to answer them by saying that they were stupid.
[02:02:51.798 --> 02:02:52.779]  Bush was stupid.
[02:02:52.919 --> 02:02:55.940]  That's why they said 9-1-1.
[02:02:55.960 --> 02:03:07.146]  He's so stupid he's gotten all this power and gotten the jack-up gas prices and hundreds of billions in unaccountable cash going into their coffers for the defense contracts and a huge approval rating.
[02:03:07.186 --> 02:03:08.947]  He's just so dumb he let this happen.
[02:03:11.583 --> 02:03:12.443]  Well, I don't know.
[02:03:12.703 --> 02:03:16.184]  But I listen to you every day, every day.
[02:03:16.244 --> 02:03:18.085]  If I don't get you in the day, I get you in.
[02:03:18.205 --> 02:03:19.086]  You're awesome.
[02:03:19.506 --> 02:03:20.646]  From two till five.
[02:03:21.526 --> 02:03:23.227]  I can't find any man like you.
[02:03:23.707 --> 02:03:24.368]  Where is one?
[02:03:24.728 --> 02:03:38.893]  But anyways, I have been, ever since this man got into office, I have been obsessed with trying to find out the truth of why they wanted to get in so bad.
[02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:43.342]  They must have spent the first six months planning 9-1-1.
[02:03:43.522 --> 02:03:44.562]  Oh, that's all come out.
[02:03:44.622 --> 02:03:46.763]  They had the launch orders to go into Afghanistan.
[02:03:46.783 --> 02:03:51.065]  They were all meeting with the bin Ladens that morning and the head of Pakistani intelligence.
[02:03:51.805 --> 02:03:55.607]  They had oil-filled maps out of all the goodies and how they jack up the prices.
[02:03:56.187 --> 02:03:58.108]  And that's the stuff that's even come out of the commission.
[02:03:58.988 --> 02:04:00.689]  So, yeah, this whole thing was set up.
[02:04:01.129 --> 02:04:04.690]  PNAC says we need a helpful terror attack to get the oil.
[02:04:06.031 --> 02:04:06.071]  Oh.
[02:04:07.786 --> 02:04:11.468]  You know, those two buildings came down at the same time.
[02:04:12.529 --> 02:04:19.295]  And the way they came down, I just saw Vesson Stadium being imploded yesterday.
[02:04:19.955 --> 02:04:23.258]  And, I mean, it's like the exact same thing.
[02:04:23.298 --> 02:04:24.959]  How could they come down at the same time?
[02:04:25.379 --> 02:04:28.722]  And, you know, there's so many questions about this.
[02:04:29.462 --> 02:04:32.565]  They're going to fall because of the Internet.
[02:04:33.325 --> 02:04:35.067]  The computer is going to kill them.
[02:04:35.769 --> 02:04:36.751]  And thank you.
[02:04:36.771 --> 02:04:37.873]  Thank you very much.
[02:04:38.374 --> 02:04:38.935]  You're awesome.
[02:04:38.955 --> 02:04:39.616]  Thanks for the call.
[02:04:39.656 --> 02:04:40.998]  We'll come back and take more calls.
[02:04:41.499 --> 02:04:43.061]  Stay with us, Infowars.com.

[02:05:54.189 --> 02:05:58.931]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:05:59.131 --> 02:06:04.794]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:06:05.034 --> 02:06:09.536]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:06:09.777 --> 02:06:16.920]  The cashless society control grid, impalpable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.

[02:06:21.643 --> 02:06:24.164]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:06:24.384 --> 02:06:31.088]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:06:45.290 --> 02:06:46.892]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:06:47.252 --> 02:06:52.997]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:06:53.257 --> 02:06:58.382]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:06:58.742 --> 02:07:08.011]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.

[02:07:47.108 --> 02:07:53.152]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:07:53.752 --> 02:07:56.734]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:58.138 --> 02:08:02.659]  Waging war on corruption, crashing with the lies and disinformation.
[02:08:02.719 --> 02:08:06.520]  Now eight minutes and 20 seconds into this third hour.
[02:08:06.540 --> 02:08:15.922]  Blasting out on the AM and FM dial from Providence, Rhode Island, to Rochester, New York, to Los Angeles, California, to Austin, Texas.
[02:08:16.782 --> 02:08:27.044]  Simulcasting on Global Shortwave during the day at 94.75, at night, of course, at 32.10, and, of course, on the Internet at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:08:27.671 --> 02:08:33.734]  I said we're going to have open phones and get into a bunch of this other 9-11 whitewash commission news and get into a bunch of Big Brother news.
[02:08:33.794 --> 02:08:40.857]  But in the first hour, I had this district attorney, John O. Boyle, on from Pierce County, Wisconsin.
[02:08:42.077 --> 02:08:44.939]  And it was a Wall Street Journal headline story yesterday.
[02:08:44.979 --> 02:08:46.439]  We've got it on the websites right now.
[02:08:46.820 --> 02:08:50.081]  In push to stop drunk driving, police draw blood.
[02:08:51.082 --> 02:08:54.703]  Well, my producer got us another guest on this because I wanted to have somebody pro and con.
[02:08:55.483 --> 02:08:56.524]  We've got somebody who's against it.
[02:08:57.176 --> 02:08:59.397]  And it says, Mr. Jones dies fighting.
[02:08:59.857 --> 02:09:02.698]  And I know people, they beat up, they put guns to their heads, they whatever.
[02:09:03.758 --> 02:09:08.600]  I've read the articles for three years on air where they do it at checkpoints on the side of the road, people.
[02:09:08.620 --> 02:09:10.880]  And they test for everything.
[02:09:10.900 --> 02:09:17.243]  I know people who are arrested for a warrant for not paying parking tickets and they take their blood in the jail.
[02:09:17.263 --> 02:09:18.503]  I mean, this is Orwellian.
[02:09:19.495 --> 02:09:21.877]  And it's just horrible.
[02:09:22.177 --> 02:09:23.298]  And I want to read two paragraphs.
[02:09:23.318 --> 02:09:27.541]  We'll go to our guest, who's an esteemed doctor.
[02:09:29.262 --> 02:09:36.408]  It says, well, they've got Guard Daniel Kerski testified that physical resistance to blood draws was a nightly event.
[02:09:36.508 --> 02:09:38.609]  Guards would use whatever force is necessary, quote.
[02:09:39.230 --> 02:09:44.994]  He testified, typically handcuffing defendants' arms behind their back, bending them over and examining them.
[02:09:45.726 --> 02:09:49.047]  An examination table in the jail nurse's office and holding them down.
[02:09:49.107 --> 02:09:51.228]  Sometimes drivers were held on the floor.
[02:09:51.548 --> 02:09:53.949]  Quote, we always get our blood.
[02:09:54.349 --> 02:09:55.089]  He testified.
[02:09:55.530 --> 02:10:00.571]  Mr. Jones, 270 pounds, tossed several officers off his back with a buck of his head.
[02:10:00.611 --> 02:10:01.852]  Two officers testified.
[02:10:02.292 --> 02:10:07.754]  Officers testified that another stood on him and kicked Mr. Jones' head.
[02:10:07.774 --> 02:10:09.114]  That officer denied the charge.
[02:10:09.175 --> 02:10:10.435]  Suddenly Mr. Jones went limp.
[02:10:11.044 --> 02:10:25.028]  The coroner ruled that Mr. Jones died of acute cardiac arrhythmia, a heart rhythm disturbance, but his second autopsy performed by a retired deputy medical examiner at the request of Mr. Jones' widow found that his head had been beaten and his left eye crushed.
[02:10:25.168 --> 02:10:29.910]  Quote, had it not been for the trauma, he probably would not have died, the doctor testified.
[02:10:31.030 --> 02:10:31.230]  So...
[02:10:33.386 --> 02:10:34.267]  Is this freedom?
[02:10:34.307 --> 02:10:37.811]  Again, imagine the Germans on the train wanting to jam needles into you.
[02:10:38.191 --> 02:10:39.612]  Oh, those evil Nazis.
[02:10:40.173 --> 02:10:44.237]  But in America now, it's freedom, right along with cameras in the school bathrooms.
[02:10:44.907 --> 02:10:52.130]  Now, it says some physicians are alarmed when doctors or those working for them draw blood for police without consent.
[02:10:52.430 --> 02:11:01.573]  The doctors argue that the Hippocratic Oath, which they don't even give anymore, requires them to put patients' needs and desires first and to respect their privacy and decisions.
[02:11:01.613 --> 02:11:10.096]  Yeah, doctors shouldn't become butchers and bakers and candlestick makers for the police and decisions to decline medical procedures.
[02:11:10.809 --> 02:11:24.851]  The American College of Emergency Physicians said in 1998 that it opposes requiring or permitting doctors to give blood results to police because such reporting fundamentally conflicts with the appropriate role of physicians in the physician-patient relationship.
[02:11:26.003 --> 02:11:28.324]  And this is a quote from the doctor who's with us now.
[02:11:28.864 --> 02:11:49.234]  For me to draw blood from a patient who is refusing to have his blood drawn, unless I have compelling medical reasons for that blood sample, I'm committing assault and battery, and I'm not going to do it, says Dr. Phil Brewer, president of the Connecticut College of Emergency Physicians and a fellow with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
[02:11:50.442 --> 02:11:52.443]  And he joins us now.
[02:11:52.763 --> 02:12:01.908]  And, again, this sets the precedent, forced inoculations, all of it, sticking needles in people and taking their person.
[02:12:02.628 --> 02:12:05.549]  Dr. Brewer, thank you for holding during my diatribe.
[02:12:05.589 --> 02:12:05.950]  Welcome.
[02:12:06.510 --> 02:12:07.670]  Hi, how are you?
[02:12:07.770 --> 02:12:10.772]  I'm doing all right, but I seem to be informed on this.
[02:12:10.812 --> 02:12:11.932]  The district attorney wasn't.
[02:12:12.373 --> 02:12:15.514]  I have articles where the cops take the blood on the side of the road.
[02:12:15.574 --> 02:12:17.075]  But why are you against this?
[02:12:18.655 --> 02:12:23.297]  Well, what I'm against is what I'm for.
[02:12:23.598 --> 02:12:25.038]  It's probably easier to explain what I'm for.
[02:12:26.039 --> 02:12:34.984]  I'm certainly for pursuing drunk drivers or people who are impaired drivers.
[02:12:36.384 --> 02:12:43.148]  But there's a method for doing that, and when it comes to drawing their blood, the laws in the states that I'm aware of,
[02:12:44.430 --> 02:12:51.524]  Only do that under informed consent, meaning the person has asked for permission to draw their blood.
[02:12:52.190 --> 02:12:55.251]  And if they agree, then I'm perfectly willing to draw it.
[02:12:55.891 --> 02:12:59.153]  And if they disagree, then I'm perfectly unwilling to draw it.
[02:12:59.173 --> 02:13:05.535]  Well, Wisconsin did 22,000 of these in 1999 alone.
[02:13:06.255 --> 02:13:08.496]  And I've talked to people where they demand the blood.
[02:13:09.016 --> 02:13:12.038]  And the point is they have the flashlights that are really breathalyzers.
[02:13:12.078 --> 02:13:15.619]  I mean, they could even hold somebody down and get their breath.
[02:13:18.355 --> 02:13:31.447]  Well, from what I understand, I don't think just showing the presence of alcohol, which is what the flashlights can do, is not enough evidence to convict somebody of a DUI.
[02:13:31.867 --> 02:13:33.449]  You have to establish what their level is.
[02:13:33.549 --> 02:13:37.293]  Well, Doctor, this isn't America having them grab people, hold them down, and take their blood.
[02:13:38.494 --> 02:13:40.736]  Yeah, I certainly don't agree with that.
[02:13:41.890 --> 02:13:52.338]  I do agree with the principle that when you get a driver's license, if you refuse to give blood, then you may forego your driving privileges for a set period of time.
[02:13:52.438 --> 02:13:55.040]  And that's a Supreme Court argument, is it a privilege or not.
[02:13:55.560 --> 02:14:06.068]  If it's the general agreed upon conveyance, it's not, but they have it listed, the automobile, as the unusual conveyance, but that's a whole other debate, and obviously you're involved with the Traffic Safety Administration.
[02:14:07.013 --> 02:14:10.595]  The federal government, so you're probably an expert on this, but let's get into the blood.
[02:14:10.975 --> 02:14:11.916]  Why are you against this?
[02:14:13.597 --> 02:14:26.803]  Well, again, I don't think that, I think when people are brought to emergency departments or to hospitals for medical care, that's the health care team, the physician, nurses, and so forth.
[02:14:27.143 --> 02:14:30.025]  That's their first responsibility is to take care of that patient.
[02:14:31.426 --> 02:14:36.749]  They have other responsibilities to protect the general health and safety.
[02:14:38.010 --> 02:14:43.253]  And if they can do both in ways that don't interfere with each other, that's fine.
[02:14:43.293 --> 02:14:58.261]  But I think if you have a person who does not want to give blood and you're literally wrestling them down to take blood from them against their will, that's clearly way beyond the bounds of medical care.
[02:14:58.982 --> 02:14:59.162]  So...
[02:15:00.519 --> 02:15:01.420]  That's why I'm against it.
[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:06.425]  I don't think we should be wrestling people to the ground and taking blood from them.
[02:15:06.906 --> 02:15:08.608]  I myself have never seen that happen.
[02:15:09.829 --> 02:15:14.554]  In fact, I think the police, at least in my state, the police rarely do that.
[02:15:14.574 --> 02:15:18.919]  I've been in Connecticut for 18 years, and I can only recall one time in 18 years when a
[02:15:20.333 --> 02:15:26.555]  A state police officer came to the hospital requesting us to draw somebody's blood.
[02:15:26.575 --> 02:15:30.277]  So at least in this part of the... this neck of the woods, it's not done very often.
[02:15:30.417 --> 02:15:36.559]  Okay, well, it says right here that they did it over 20,000 times in 1999 alone in Wisconsin.
[02:15:36.579 --> 02:15:37.260]  23,500 times.
[02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:37.460]  And...
[02:15:46.707 --> 02:15:56.755]  Also, they have quotes here from the Las Vegas jail guards saying that every night people refuse and they have to hold them down.
[02:15:57.015 --> 02:15:58.536]  They have restraining systems.
[02:15:58.936 --> 02:16:02.519]  And, of course, they have the case of them killing someone in Las Vegas.
[02:16:03.980 --> 02:16:13.788]  Do they... I'm not a lawyer, but from what I understand, in those circumstances, if somebody refuses...
[02:16:14.948 --> 02:16:18.170]  Certainly in Connecticut, you can only do it with a court order.
[02:16:19.590 --> 02:16:22.492]  Not in these other states that use all color of law.
[02:16:23.072 --> 02:16:25.793]  They beat the living tar out of you, stomp on your head.
[02:16:25.893 --> 02:16:31.576]  I mean, around here in Texas when they arrest you, you can get out peacefully, but they go ahead and slam you around a bit.
[02:16:31.656 --> 02:16:32.936]  So it's kind of a... Right.
[02:16:34.517 --> 02:16:37.598]  So up in Connecticut, it's still a bit more genteel.
[02:16:38.779 --> 02:16:39.699]  I suppose, or else...
[02:16:43.032 --> 02:16:48.437]  Maybe there aren't enough police to come to the hospital and investigate these cases.
[02:16:48.477 --> 02:16:50.499]  Well, have you read the Wall Street Journal article?
[02:16:51.340 --> 02:16:52.121]  I haven't, actually.
[02:16:54.103 --> 02:17:00.849]  The gentleman who wrote it interviewed me about a month ago, and we had a fairly long conversation.
[02:17:00.869 --> 02:17:03.612]  It was front page yesterday.
[02:17:03.632 --> 02:17:04.172]  Uh-huh.
[02:17:04.333 --> 02:17:04.533]  Well...
[02:17:05.296 --> 02:17:06.796]  Have to get a copy of it, I suppose.
[02:17:06.836 --> 02:17:10.077]  You can go to infowars.com.
[02:17:10.477 --> 02:17:10.917]  Okay.
[02:17:11.217 --> 02:17:13.138]  Planet.com, and it's a top story.
[02:17:13.178 --> 02:17:15.899]  But, yeah, I mean, this is a scary article.
[02:17:15.979 --> 02:17:22.580]  They've got jail guards in here snickering and, you know, saying, yeah, people resist every night, but we get the blood.
[02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:24.561]  I mean, it's just scary.
[02:17:24.601 --> 02:17:26.401]  I mean, that just doesn't sound like America.
[02:17:27.041 --> 02:17:28.542]  Uh-huh.
[02:17:29.182 --> 02:17:33.543]  Well, I've worked on this issue for a long time because in my position...
[02:17:35.048 --> 02:17:57.740]  I can honestly say that with maybe four or five exceptions, over 20 years of practicing full-time as an emergency physician, I have never had a shift without at least one person who was a victim of a drunk driving accident.
[02:17:58.680 --> 02:18:02.062]  That's how widespread it is and how big a problem it is.
[02:18:03.765 --> 02:18:10.948]  I mean, the issue of people dying from drunk drivers makes 911 look pretty minor by comparison.
[02:18:10.968 --> 02:18:16.470]  Yeah, but those that will give up liberty to attain security will get and deserve neither.
[02:18:16.670 --> 02:18:23.892]  I mean, you know, setting up checkpoints and sucking people's blood, I mean, I'm more afraid of that than I am drunk drivers.
[02:18:23.912 --> 02:18:24.952]  I mean, I drive all the time.
[02:18:24.972 --> 02:18:26.253]  Every once in a while you see a drunk.
[02:18:26.869 --> 02:18:28.010]  The police pull them over.
[02:18:28.451 --> 02:18:35.898]  I mean, I know thousands and thousands and thousands of people die every year from drunks, but thousands and thousands die from distracted drivers.
[02:18:35.918 --> 02:18:39.842]  I mean, now they want to mount cameras in the cars to make sure you're not distracted.
[02:18:40.222 --> 02:18:41.183]  Have you seen those articles?
[02:18:42.444 --> 02:18:45.567]  Yeah, I don't... Big Brother will keep me safe, I mean.
[02:18:45.847 --> 02:18:46.048]  Yeah.
[02:18:46.188 --> 02:18:49.151]  Well, there were 17,000 deaths last year.
[02:18:52.229 --> 02:18:57.081]  And that doesn't count people who were permanently maimed and disfigured and disabled.
[02:18:58.024 --> 02:18:59.267]  So it's a huge problem.
[02:18:59.307 --> 02:19:00.410]  It's like if you took a...
[02:19:02.641 --> 02:19:05.682]  737 and crashed it full of passengers every day.
[02:19:06.182 --> 02:19:07.842]  That's basically what we're faced with.
[02:19:07.902 --> 02:19:09.523]  No, I know, but here's the deal.
[02:19:09.803 --> 02:19:10.683]  It's never going to stop.
[02:19:10.723 --> 02:19:12.043]  There's more bars everywhere.
[02:19:12.283 --> 02:19:13.763]  The society's designed to do it.
[02:19:14.103 --> 02:19:16.544]  Humans have been guzzling alcohol for thousands of years.
[02:19:16.944 --> 02:19:20.985]  And the point is we're going to end up with the entire population in prison, and it's just going to continue.
[02:19:21.425 --> 02:19:22.765]  Well, we've made a lot of progress.
[02:19:22.785 --> 02:19:27.126]  I mean, there's a lot fewer drunk driving deaths now than there were 10 years ago.
[02:19:27.466 --> 02:19:29.628]  I tell you what, I want to ask you about that when we get back.
[02:19:29.828 --> 02:19:30.088]  Okay.
[02:19:30.669 --> 02:19:34.472]  Just do one more little segment with us, and then callers will get to you afterwards, and I'll get to all the other news.
[02:19:35.372 --> 02:19:36.473]  Because I want to discuss this.
[02:19:36.513 --> 02:19:39.876]  The move to put breathalyzers by law in all cars.
[02:19:40.657 --> 02:19:41.557]  It will save us.
[02:19:42.058 --> 02:19:43.299]  We'll talk about that when we get back.

[02:21:58.463 --> 02:22:00.265]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[02:22:00.825 --> 02:22:02.847]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.

[02:23:35.512 --> 02:23:35.872]  All right.
[02:23:35.892 --> 02:23:37.393]  There's another quote from...
[02:23:56.306 --> 02:24:03.448]  Dr. Phil Brewer, president of the Connecticut College of Emergency Physicians and a fellow of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
[02:24:04.049 --> 02:24:17.653]  Dr. Brewer says some doctors fear that reporting alcohol levels to the police might violate the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which makes the unauthorized disclosure of a patient's record a crime.
[02:24:18.074 --> 02:24:20.234]  Quote, who's willing to take that risk, he asks.
[02:24:20.394 --> 02:24:22.295]  I don't want it to be the test case.
[02:24:22.870 --> 02:24:24.491]  Well, you haven't gotten the word, Doctor.
[02:24:24.531 --> 02:24:25.772]  They don't follow the law.
[02:24:25.832 --> 02:24:28.533]  It's all about breaking it if you're the government.
[02:24:29.373 --> 02:24:32.555]  And so that's what these people are doing.
[02:24:33.115 --> 02:24:49.504]  But getting back, Doctor, into drunk driving, you obviously don't want to come on and defend what's happening, but when a society becomes decadent and you've got idiots everywhere, then the corrupt state gets to come in and run everybody's lives and treat us like children, and then people who don't act like children get treated like children.
[02:24:50.437 --> 02:25:01.625]  But, you know, there's a move in New York, the move, it's almost passed, it's out of the house in New Mexico to make everybody get in their car and have a breathalyzer detector automatically.
[02:25:02.026 --> 02:25:03.547]  I mean, I'm not going to put up with that.
[02:25:04.868 --> 02:25:05.949]  What's your comment on that?
[02:25:06.909 --> 02:25:12.874]  Well, I don't think having breathalyzers in all cars is needed or warranted.
[02:25:12.894 --> 02:25:16.997]  The great majority of drivers...
[02:25:18.089 --> 02:25:29.474]  Do not drive under the influence of alcohol, and there are plenty of drivers who drive under the influence of other drugs that aren't detected by breathalyzers, so that would be a huge expenditure.
[02:25:29.494 --> 02:25:38.099]  By the way, this district attorney said that if you're on Ritalin or Prozac and they test your blood and find it, they'll go ahead and arrest you, even if it's prescribed.
[02:25:39.739 --> 02:25:45.082]  Well, if it can be shown that you're impaired by it, that's a pretty difficult thing to do.
[02:25:46.296 --> 02:25:50.918]  But let's just stick to alcohol, if you don't mind, because I shouldn't have mentioned the other drugs.
[02:25:50.938 --> 02:25:51.558]  That's my fault.
[02:25:53.579 --> 02:25:56.459]  Alcohol is complicated enough as it is.
[02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:13.145]  In states where the one thing that's been shown in people who are repeat drunk driving offenders, the one thing that seems to work better than anything is interlock devices or having a breathalyzer that
[02:26:13.581 --> 02:26:18.024]  You have to blow into and have a negative reading before you can start your car.
[02:26:19.004 --> 02:26:28.170]  That costs about $70 to install, and there's a $70 a month maintenance fee by whichever company you have put it in.
[02:26:29.791 --> 02:26:41.598]  And that's effective, but that's only for people who are repeat offenders, who have had two or three convictions, and especially the ones who are convicted and have lost their licenses
[02:26:42.054 --> 02:26:43.535]  And continue to drive anyway.
[02:26:45.296 --> 02:26:47.897]  To take... You know, what's wrong with these idiots?
[02:26:49.558 --> 02:26:52.039]  I don't know, but there's plenty of them to go around.
[02:26:52.499 --> 02:27:00.983]  And, you know, they will keep driving if you don't take... Some of them will keep driving if you don't somehow prevent them.
[02:27:01.343 --> 02:27:06.786]  And another technique that's used in some places is impounding the vehicle.
[02:27:06.806 --> 02:27:09.447]  The problem with that is, is if it's a family vehicle...
[02:27:10.066 --> 02:27:12.207]  Yeah, but you notice how this works.
[02:27:12.227 --> 02:27:13.707]  Now they're wanting to make it for everybody.
[02:27:38.311 --> 02:27:47.954]  Well, I haven't... I don't know of any places where there's actually a law that's advancing and where that's likely to happen.
[02:27:47.994 --> 02:27:50.314]  Very close to passing in New Mexico and New York.
[02:27:51.835 --> 02:27:58.857]  Well, I haven't... I'm right next door to New York, and I've not seen that.
[02:28:00.317 --> 02:28:02.238]  I would be extremely astonished.
[02:28:02.758 --> 02:28:05.379]  That would be such an unpopular law.
[02:28:05.399 --> 02:28:06.599]  I mean, that would basically be...
[02:28:07.466 --> 02:28:10.568]  A $600 or $700 tax on every single car.
[02:28:11.429 --> 02:28:13.351]  I can't imagine that actually being enacted.
[02:28:13.691 --> 02:28:15.112]  Pass the House in New Mexico.
[02:28:15.632 --> 02:28:21.276]  Yeah, well, you know, sometimes people pass laws knowing that they're not going to be signed into law for political reasons.
[02:28:21.937 --> 02:28:22.858]  Oh, for publicity.
[02:28:23.438 --> 02:28:31.384]  I doubt very much that Bill Richards, who I think is the governor of New Mexico, would stay governor very long if he signed that law.
[02:28:31.484 --> 02:28:32.845]  No, they've got a new one.
[02:28:33.326 --> 02:28:33.746]  Okay.
[02:28:34.186 --> 02:28:35.107]  Well, whoever the governor is,
[02:28:37.124 --> 02:28:41.725]  He or she is not going to sign that law because that'll be the end of their term.
[02:28:41.926 --> 02:28:42.886]  No, I think it is Richardson.
[02:28:43.306 --> 02:28:44.827]  Yeah, I think it's Bill Richardson.
[02:28:44.847 --> 02:28:46.827]  Former Clinton Energy Secretary.
[02:28:46.847 --> 02:28:47.268]  Yeah.
[02:28:47.628 --> 02:28:50.169]  Okay, well, Doctor, anything else you want to add here?
[02:28:51.749 --> 02:29:02.434]  Well, again, this is a tricky issue because people certainly do have the right to go out and drive on safe roads, and one of the major menaces to...
[02:29:03.889 --> 02:29:06.830]  And you agree that having the police do it or making doctors do it is a violation?
[02:29:06.850 --> 02:29:10.531]  Oh, I think wrestling people down and drawing blood against their will is definitely not a good idea.
[02:29:26.861 --> 02:29:29.463]  Well, that's an old American ideal.
[02:29:30.044 --> 02:29:31.305]  Hey, Doctor, thanks for coming on.
[02:29:31.525 --> 02:29:32.285]  All right, thank you.
[02:29:32.526 --> 02:29:33.726]  We'll be back with your calls more news.
[02:29:33.747 --> 02:29:34.087]  Stay with us.
[02:29:36.329 --> 02:29:37.249]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.730 --> 02:29:39.351]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:40.252 --> 02:29:42.934]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:46.149 --> 02:29:52.392]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:29:52.512 --> 02:29:58.676]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:29:58.976 --> 02:30:07.400]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:30:07.660 --> 02:30:14.664]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:30:14.984 --> 02:30:19.787]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:30:20.007 --> 02:30:25.431]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:30:25.771 --> 02:30:28.833]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:30:29.174 --> 02:30:37.139]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:32:51.063 --> 02:32:53.003]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:32:53.483 --> 02:32:56.344]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:32:56.544 --> 02:33:04.527]  We have unaccountable power and authority in this country by a bunch of government twits and their banker bosses.
[02:33:05.347 --> 02:33:08.369]  That think that we are their property, and I'm sick and tired of it.
[02:33:08.409 --> 02:33:09.310]  What about you?
[02:33:11.411 --> 02:33:13.192]  Let's go ahead and take some calls.
[02:33:13.212 --> 02:33:16.995]  Because they can talk about drunk driving all day, my friends.
[02:33:17.075 --> 02:33:19.797]  Governments last century killed 200 million people.
[02:33:20.357 --> 02:33:21.118]  Innocent people.
[02:33:21.158 --> 02:33:22.919]  Let's talk about that.
[02:33:23.419 --> 02:33:26.561]  Let's talk about how they're getting control of our lives to do it again.
[02:33:27.602 --> 02:33:31.084]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Tennessee.
[02:33:31.184 --> 02:33:32.005]  John, go ahead.
[02:33:32.545 --> 02:33:33.006]  Hey, Alex.
[02:33:33.939 --> 02:33:41.747]  Since you drive without a driver's license contract, police lack jurisdiction to force you to take a blood alcohol test under implied consent.
[02:33:42.848 --> 02:33:43.729]  So that's a good thing.
[02:33:43.749 --> 02:33:46.932]  It's all color of law.
[02:33:46.972 --> 02:33:52.938]  You heard the doctor, fellow in the federal government, saying it's illegal for them to do this, but they still do it.
[02:33:53.118 --> 02:33:56.962]  Well, medical doctors murder a thousand times more people in car crashes with...
[02:33:57.492 --> 02:34:00.633]  Med mal, medications, vaccinations, aborticides.
[02:34:00.653 --> 02:34:05.815]  I don't know about 100 times, but it's way over what the cars do, and that's an official number.
[02:34:05.995 --> 02:34:09.357]  Well, it's 5 million Americans die every year out of 300 million.
[02:34:09.817 --> 02:34:14.018]  One and a half million doctors confess to killing, but they're never arrested for murder.
[02:34:16.239 --> 02:34:18.840]  Well, those numbers have come out.
[02:34:18.960 --> 02:34:20.941]  The most dangerous thing to do is to go visit a doctor.
[02:34:21.633 --> 02:34:25.435]  I mean, doctors also do great work, but they make a lot of mistakes.
[02:34:25.876 --> 02:34:27.477]  That's why they call it a practice.
[02:34:28.838 --> 02:34:34.681]  Well, I worked as an investigator on two wrongful death lawsuits of people tortured and murdered by police.
[02:34:35.302 --> 02:34:39.684]  In one case, an ex-cop was beaten to death on the side of a road during a DUI arrest.
[02:34:40.305 --> 02:34:49.991]  In another $10 million case, an innocent, unconvicted woman was murdered in solitary confinement by denial of food, water, and medical care during a diabetic coma.
[02:34:50.632 --> 02:34:51.252]  Well, I know this.
[02:35:15.655 --> 02:35:19.856]  I mean, I just read the Chicago Sun-Times, where Homeland Security's controlling Hollywood.
[02:35:20.217 --> 02:35:25.758]  They got a $70 million fake newscast, and they're funding that tortures goods, selling us on this.
[02:35:26.018 --> 02:35:29.239]  So get ready to be tortured, because cops think they're heroes when they torture you.
[02:35:29.379 --> 02:35:32.240]  Well, that's an assault to stick a needle in your arm that can kill you.
[02:35:32.821 --> 02:35:40.183]  By the way, they admit that there are a lot of conditions where that will cause you to go into shock or die, and that's what the doctors are saying.
[02:35:40.203 --> 02:35:41.243]  But the cops don't care.
[02:35:41.603 --> 02:35:43.404]  All it takes is an air bubble to kill you.
[02:35:43.860 --> 02:35:51.508]  And Mr. Boyle, in your interview, admitted that a person is already under arrest for DUI before the blood test is taken.
[02:35:51.548 --> 02:35:56.112]  This means police do not require a blood test to win a conviction for DUI.
[02:35:56.492 --> 02:35:58.494]  It also means there's no passing score.
[02:35:59.095 --> 02:36:08.264]  And the Tennessee Driver Handbook right now confesses, quote, a driver can register a BAC of 0.0% and still be convicted of DUI, the level...
[02:36:08.803 --> 02:36:13.584]  The BAC does not clear a driver when it's below the presumed level of intoxication of .08.
[02:36:13.744 --> 02:36:15.785]  End quote.
[02:36:16.765 --> 02:36:18.185]  So the whole thing's a big scam.
[02:36:18.586 --> 02:36:18.766]  It is.
[02:36:18.806 --> 02:36:19.986]  It's a huge moneymaker.
[02:36:20.046 --> 02:36:20.686]  Thanks for the call.
[02:36:21.526 --> 02:36:22.246]  Very interesting.
[02:36:22.787 --> 02:36:25.807]  They're going to keep us safe.
[02:36:25.827 --> 02:36:27.748]  Let's talk to Ian in Canada.
[02:36:27.768 --> 02:36:28.568]  Ian, go ahead.
[02:36:29.108 --> 02:36:29.728]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:36:30.289 --> 02:36:34.070]  I wanted to give you a heads up on the continuing saga of gun control up here.
[02:36:34.830 --> 02:36:35.790]  Just as a preamble,
[02:36:36.314 --> 02:36:43.418]  You know that they brought in the gun registration, and, of course, the illicit gun market exploded.
[02:36:43.738 --> 02:36:48.781]  And then the guns they registered, well, they banned 63% of the guns registered within one year.
[02:36:49.122 --> 02:36:50.662]  Yeah, the same old story.
[02:36:52.283 --> 02:36:54.925]  Criminality with guns has exploded.
[02:36:54.945 --> 02:36:56.906]  The illicit gun market exploded.
[02:36:58.127 --> 02:36:59.568]  Well, it's the same thing with drugs.
[02:36:59.588 --> 02:37:00.668]  1% of America...
[02:37:02.317 --> 02:37:04.079]  Used opiates, okay?
[02:37:04.439 --> 02:37:05.280]  Turn of the century.
[02:37:05.600 --> 02:37:07.382]  Then by the 30s, they banned it.
[02:37:07.642 --> 02:37:09.083]  That made it have greater value.
[02:37:09.123 --> 02:37:11.145]  Then there was a market to push it.
[02:37:11.747 --> 02:37:13.568]  Push it on your children in the schoolyard.
[02:37:13.708 --> 02:37:14.088]  Push it.
[02:37:14.128 --> 02:37:15.088]  The police pushing it.
[02:37:15.589 --> 02:37:19.990]  And then now, upwards of, what, 25 to 30 percent of people use opiates at one time or another.
[02:37:20.491 --> 02:37:21.611]  So this is the point.
[02:37:21.751 --> 02:37:23.432]  It's a scientific fact.
[02:37:23.672 --> 02:37:28.194]  There was some idiot congressman on C-SPAN this morning going, we have to morally keep going.
[02:37:28.214 --> 02:37:30.195]  We'll never defeat it, but we have to morally fight it.
[02:37:30.335 --> 02:37:30.935]  Morally?
[02:37:31.115 --> 02:37:33.176]  You're pushing Ritalin and Prozac on more people.
[02:37:33.236 --> 02:37:34.276]  It's just as bad or worse.
[02:37:34.636 --> 02:37:35.557]  It's a sick joke.
[02:37:35.577 --> 02:37:38.318]  It's an excuse for these goons to get into our lives.
[02:37:38.658 --> 02:37:40.259]  Well, let me get to this point.
[02:37:40.279 --> 02:37:43.942]  I'm sort of building up to something that's going to absolutely enrage you when you hear this.
[02:37:45.543 --> 02:38:03.796]  Of course, the billion-dollar gun program was supposed to cost $2 million, but I'm convinced that that billion dollars has been redirected like they did with the Clinton administration into buying armored vehicles and state-of-the-art body armor and automatic weapons for our municipal police forces, which have been equipped with this.
[02:38:03.857 --> 02:38:04.317]  And there was no...
[02:38:04.949 --> 02:38:05.669]  No, I saw that article.
[02:38:05.689 --> 02:38:06.810]  Yeah, which one are you talking about?
[02:38:06.830 --> 02:38:09.351]  Now understand now, understand now.
[02:38:29.027 --> 02:38:31.593]  They have 85-year-old retired railway workers.
[02:38:31.613 --> 02:38:35.743]  You know, I see these articles every month, but in one particular case we had them on a few years ago,
[02:38:36.454 --> 02:38:41.195]  You have your gun owner ID card in Illinois, and it's usually old people.
[02:38:41.235 --> 02:38:51.158]  They forget to re-register each year and pay their privilege fee, and they do a SWAT team raid on them, or they call them cage teams.
[02:38:51.778 --> 02:38:57.420]  And so, yeah, now you haven't paid your child support, you get this black scheme-ass goon raid.
[02:38:57.700 --> 02:38:58.860]  It's all about intimidation.
[02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:02.741]  Alex, did you hear last, I think it was Friday, now...
[02:39:03.484 --> 02:39:07.406]  We have welcomed the alcohol, tobacco, and firearms people.
[02:39:07.826 --> 02:39:11.587]  Those murdering bandits are going to establish an office in Toronto.
[02:39:12.708 --> 02:39:13.788]  Oh, how wonderful.
[02:39:13.808 --> 02:39:15.269]  Well, it's been radically expanded.
[02:39:15.289 --> 02:39:17.689]  They built a giant new building for them in D.C.
[02:39:17.749 --> 02:39:19.150]  Lord Bush did that.
[02:39:19.210 --> 02:39:21.151]  I mean, it's so conservative.
[02:39:21.311 --> 02:39:25.012]  And there's no outrage on the part of all the liberals up here.
[02:39:25.072 --> 02:39:32.155]  The Canadians, they convince themselves and delude themselves that they're the nicest country.
[02:39:32.651 --> 02:39:33.211]  In the world.
[02:39:33.472 --> 02:39:37.674]  And this is often a foil they use against the American character as they perceive it.
[02:39:38.195 --> 02:39:41.577]  But you don't see any outrage of this.
[02:39:41.717 --> 02:39:47.020]  You'd think that people who really believe that they're so nice and so socialist would be up in arms.
[02:39:47.320 --> 02:39:51.043]  Now, I want you to understand, I'm a guy, as far as guns are concerned, I don't have any.
[02:39:51.103 --> 02:39:51.923]  They're like golf clubs.
[02:39:52.043 --> 02:39:54.205]  I don't need them and I don't need more stuff in my life.
[02:39:54.485 --> 02:39:59.188]  But I know that the right of my neighbor to possess firearms protects me.
[02:39:59.918 --> 02:40:01.479]  And I know the history of the ATF.
[02:40:01.519 --> 02:40:03.941]  Maybe you could give me a little potted history of the ATF.
[02:40:04.681 --> 02:40:08.264]  Weren't they involved in the murder at Waco?
[02:40:08.544 --> 02:40:12.307]  Aren't they, in fact, involved in the control of illicit gun trading?
[02:40:13.348 --> 02:40:13.868]  Everything.
[02:40:14.128 --> 02:40:18.231]  It's the most criminal organization that's on the surface in the federal government.
[02:40:18.611 --> 02:40:19.392]  And thanks for the call.
[02:40:19.432 --> 02:40:20.713]  I'll go over that here briefly.
[02:40:22.225 --> 02:40:24.986]  They were known as the regulators, the enforcers.
[02:40:25.546 --> 02:40:33.889]  And before the feds got smart and banned alcohol for a decade, so the politicians could all run the alcohol trade themselves and make huge profits.
[02:40:34.229 --> 02:40:39.371]  Again, there were all this competition, thousands of breweries, thousands of whiskey makers.
[02:40:39.991 --> 02:40:46.814]  And so the big whiskey families, this is all public information, lobbied to have it banned.
[02:40:48.268 --> 02:40:52.250]  They then publicly had their factories and made it and shipped it out and nothing was done.
[02:40:52.671 --> 02:40:56.113]  The first checkpoints were set up and they would search the vehicles.
[02:40:56.173 --> 02:40:57.534]  It was a good way to corrupt the police.
[02:40:58.054 --> 02:41:04.318]  Alcoholism tripled and massive increases in alcohol poisoning because it was a bad quality.
[02:41:05.804 --> 02:41:17.912]  Just the Seagram's folks up in Canada, your good folks, the Broffmans, they lobbied for it and made record money out of it.
[02:41:17.952 --> 02:41:19.173]  The Kennedys and others did.
[02:41:20.354 --> 02:41:22.935]  And so they brought all this in.
[02:41:23.236 --> 02:41:29.320]  But before that, going back into the 1800s, 1900s, even before that, even before the 30s and the 20s,
[02:41:32.446 --> 02:41:33.747]  We're good to go.
[02:42:02.014 --> 02:42:04.536]  That's what happened during Reconstruction, too, with the northern soldiers.
[02:42:04.556 --> 02:42:07.338]  You give them unlimited power, this happens in history.
[02:42:07.378 --> 02:42:08.119]  It's human nature.
[02:42:09.039 --> 02:42:10.240]  You support the troops, don't you?
[02:42:10.260 --> 02:42:11.341]  I mean, that's a sick line.
[02:42:12.082 --> 02:42:15.024]  So the BATF was the Bureau of Alcohol and Tobacco.
[02:42:15.945 --> 02:42:22.430]  And then they slapped firearms onto it, and they said, oh, this evil hillbilly had a shotgun he sawed off and shot somebody.
[02:42:22.470 --> 02:42:23.250]  Let's ban that.
[02:42:23.310 --> 02:42:24.531]  Oh, yeah, that's a hillbilly gun.
[02:42:24.571 --> 02:42:25.152]  Let's ban it.
[02:42:25.192 --> 02:42:26.913]  And that's how it all started.
[02:42:27.654 --> 02:42:43.630]  And so in big insurance scams by big globalists, they're allowed to burn down their buildings, BATF covers it up, and then they'll go after a few real arsonists or a few people that are innocent, a few token symbolic busts of people running illegal cigarettes.
[02:42:43.810 --> 02:42:45.912]  It's just all a big scam.
[02:42:45.972 --> 02:42:47.293]  Research the BATF.
[02:42:47.333 --> 02:42:50.596]  They are just an incredibly criminal organization.
[02:42:53.706 --> 02:42:55.427]  I mean, they'll plant a gun on you in a minute.
[02:42:56.127 --> 02:42:58.948]  Some of the states have passed the so-called gun show loophole law.
[02:42:59.368 --> 02:43:02.869]  Well, then that means you can't buy a gun from your neighbor if more than two people are there.
[02:43:02.929 --> 02:43:04.669]  So they'll have three people there.
[02:43:05.310 --> 02:43:08.911]  Your neighbor was really a BATF officer with their friend there.
[02:43:09.191 --> 02:43:11.812]  So that makes it three people, an illegal gun show.
[02:43:12.352 --> 02:43:14.512]  And you end up getting five years in federal prison.
[02:43:14.532 --> 02:43:17.093]  And the Republicans, of course, support with the Democrats.
[02:43:17.373 --> 02:43:19.074]  Project Exile, it's a gun crime.
[02:43:19.094 --> 02:43:19.814]  Now it's federal.
[02:43:20.134 --> 02:43:21.575]  Special federal prosecutors.
[02:43:21.635 --> 02:43:22.575]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:43:23.315 --> 02:43:25.056]  Let's talk to Rob in Wyoming.
[02:43:25.136 --> 02:43:25.937]  Rob, go ahead.
[02:43:25.957 --> 02:43:26.938]  Hey, Alex.
[02:43:27.338 --> 02:43:28.318]  Two points if I can get to them.
[02:43:28.358 --> 02:43:29.159]  If not, oh well.
[02:43:29.919 --> 02:43:37.204]  First of all, on CNN, Ryan Lamb, you know, notice how one caller said, so you do everything Alex Jones tells you to do?
[02:43:38.184 --> 02:43:40.126]  You know, totally out of the blue.
[02:43:41.046 --> 02:43:43.708]  Like you're some kind of cult leader or something, you know.
[02:43:44.359 --> 02:43:48.421]  Yeah, I just sit here reading mainstream news articles of what they're doing to us and make films.
[02:43:48.881 --> 02:43:57.424]  People that agree with someone else or are in sympathetic intellectual belief with someone else, they're blindly following them, I guess.
[02:43:57.724 --> 02:44:00.465]  So if you vote for Bush, you just do whatever he tells you to do, yeah.
[02:44:00.685 --> 02:44:01.485]  Right.
[02:44:01.925 --> 02:44:03.366]  What did you think of that C-SPAN piece?
[02:44:04.326 --> 02:44:04.727]  Well, it was...
[02:44:06.767 --> 02:44:09.210]  It was just a remarkable piece of disinformation.
[02:44:09.230 --> 02:44:20.622]  I don't have the number in front of me, but I'm asking all our listeners to be nice to them, but to go to Infowars.com, Brian Lamb's still on the main page, click on the phone numbers there, call their office and say, look,
[02:44:21.451 --> 02:44:23.172]  You know, Alex has been nice about this.
[02:44:23.252 --> 02:44:24.953]  Brian Lamb talks about him all the time.
[02:44:25.233 --> 02:44:28.635]  He's had two authors on that have written books about him, attacking him.
[02:44:29.536 --> 02:44:33.578]  You know, don't tell Alex that, well, this is the election cycle.
[02:44:33.598 --> 02:44:34.839]  We're not on that now.
[02:44:35.259 --> 02:44:41.383]  When you just have this, quote, conspiracy author on, you know, give Alex a fair shake, his fair time.
[02:44:41.403 --> 02:44:41.963]  Defend himself.
[02:44:42.443 --> 02:44:42.724]  Pardon me?
[02:44:42.744 --> 02:44:43.184]  Equal time.
[02:44:43.864 --> 02:44:44.985]  Defend yourself, absolutely.
[02:44:45.472 --> 02:44:45.992]  It doesn't matter.
[02:44:46.252 --> 02:44:55.075]  If the MC span is so fair and balanced, I want everybody tomorrow morning, Washington Journal, all the shows, please call them in the morning.
[02:44:55.095 --> 02:44:56.976]  Come on, it's 6 o'clock Central or something.
[02:44:57.556 --> 02:45:00.737]  Call into that show and tell them, hey, have Alex Jones on.
[02:45:00.757 --> 02:45:01.637]  Let him defend himself.
[02:45:01.697 --> 02:45:03.017]  Infowars.com.
[02:45:03.278 --> 02:45:07.059]  Well, let him debate this expert on conspiracy.
[02:45:08.159 --> 02:45:09.780]  And, you know, they're afraid of me.
[02:45:09.820 --> 02:45:11.220]  I'm going to be nice if I go on the show.
[02:45:12.826 --> 02:45:15.308]  Look, I don't even care about going on the show.
[02:45:15.328 --> 02:45:16.608]  I need to defend myself here.
[02:45:16.808 --> 02:45:21.391]  Right, well, they're denying me the same opportunity in our statewide paper that's the only paper here.
[02:45:21.771 --> 02:45:23.412]  But I may not have time to get to that.
[02:45:23.432 --> 02:45:24.432]  What was your second point?
[02:45:24.452 --> 02:45:24.792]  Go ahead.
[02:45:25.192 --> 02:45:28.114]  Well, the first point's actually more germane to this show.
[02:45:28.994 --> 02:45:32.416]  I was driving down the road at night the other night, and...
[02:45:33.206 --> 02:45:34.366]  You know, a cop comes behind me.
[02:45:34.386 --> 02:45:42.109]  He starts tailgating me to see... Now, I pulled kind of a rolling stop, but there was nobody around except him, and I kind of pulled in front of him a little too fast.
[02:45:42.790 --> 02:45:48.732]  So anyway, he starts not tailgating, but he would have soon, to kind of put pressure on me to speed up.
[02:45:48.792 --> 02:45:50.572]  There's not a convenient place to turn off.
[02:45:51.073 --> 02:45:53.053]  They're trying to force me into something, right?
[02:45:53.394 --> 02:45:54.574]  So anyway, he stops me, gets out.
[02:45:54.894 --> 02:46:02.297]  He admits that he knows about my sworn affidavit, and I explained to him, you know, nicely, I was real nice, that you're going to have to...
[02:46:03.078 --> 02:46:06.641]  Yeah, almost all the state codes, the federal code, they have to have their identification out.
[02:46:31.821 --> 02:46:37.727]  Right, and they've got little tiny numbers on the front and back bumpers of their cars instead of painted big on the side so you can't see what car it is.
[02:46:38.007 --> 02:46:39.249]  You know, why not just wear a mask?
[02:46:39.869 --> 02:46:43.753]  So anyway, now the guy starts getting hot-tempered.
[02:46:43.813 --> 02:46:51.461]  Another cop car, you know, during the checking my license and all that, he calls for backup for no reason, and I'm being totally calm.
[02:46:51.863 --> 02:46:55.144]  And this other guy sneaks up like I can't see him.
[02:46:55.584 --> 02:46:59.005]  And he starts coming and trying to chew me out.
[02:46:59.345 --> 02:47:02.125]  So I start pulling away and nodding and saying, Am I free to go?
[02:47:02.305 --> 02:47:03.345]  It's over 15 minutes.
[02:47:03.365 --> 02:47:04.486]  This is a detainment.
[02:47:04.686 --> 02:47:05.366]  Am I under arrest?
[02:47:05.386 --> 02:47:05.726]  Goodbye.
[02:47:06.146 --> 02:47:11.007]  As I'm pulling away, using my left arm to signal that I'm pulling into the lane.
[02:47:11.467 --> 02:47:13.588]  And the other guy's saying, Okay, see ya.
[02:47:14.228 --> 02:47:15.188]  He was actually pretty cool.
[02:47:15.688 --> 02:47:17.688]  So then the second guy starts shouting at me.
[02:47:17.748 --> 02:47:18.449]  My window's down.
[02:47:18.989 --> 02:47:20.289]  Put your seatbelt on!
[02:47:21.178 --> 02:47:23.400]  Okay, so now I completely ignore him.
[02:47:23.480 --> 02:47:24.882]  I ignore what he was saying before.
[02:47:26.083 --> 02:47:26.903]  Then he says it again.
[02:47:27.124 --> 02:47:28.185]  He shouts at me again.
[02:47:28.245 --> 02:47:29.646]  Put your seatbelt on!
[02:47:30.146 --> 02:47:31.268]  Like he's my nanny, you know.
[02:47:31.628 --> 02:47:34.390]  Dress nice and warm or I'll crack your head open.
[02:47:34.430 --> 02:47:36.592]  That's how concerned he is for your well-being.
[02:47:37.053 --> 02:47:39.115]  So I just defied him and drove off.
[02:47:39.815 --> 02:47:40.736]  And that was the end of that.
[02:47:41.077 --> 02:47:42.458]  But I thought you'd find that interesting.
[02:47:42.658 --> 02:47:43.860]  Okay, last point.
[02:47:44.020 --> 02:47:44.501]  Last point.
[02:47:44.521 --> 02:47:45.242]  You've got 30 seconds.
[02:47:45.322 --> 02:47:55.374]  Okay, the Tribune, I wanted to counteract the falsehoods of the Tribunes printed by Ed Fielner of the Heritage Foundation that the notorious sections of the Patriot Act are sunsetted,
[02:47:55.794 --> 02:47:57.356]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:47:57.436 --> 02:48:04.205]  The sunset section sunsets the stuff about how we love the liberals and happy birdies.
[02:48:04.525 --> 02:48:06.828]  All the really serious stuff is not sunsetted.
[02:48:06.968 --> 02:48:12.135]  Well, I tried to counteract that, and by personal grudge and retaliation, or at least extreme negligence,
[02:48:12.595 --> 02:48:13.235]  Well, that's Lee...
[02:48:34.042 --> 02:48:38.805]  Especially when I said it appeared the editor-in-chief and the publisher have entered into a conspiracy against me.
[02:48:38.825 --> 02:48:43.809]  Yeah, they can't take your letter and edit it and then not later let you pay for your own notice.
[02:48:44.269 --> 02:48:45.650]  Gotta let you go, gotta let you go.
[02:48:45.970 --> 02:48:48.552]  Michael in Rhode Island, or Michelle in Rhode Island, go ahead.
[02:48:50.633 --> 02:48:52.555]  Michelle, it's good to talk to you here on the show today.
[02:48:53.535 --> 02:48:57.858]  Hey, I wanted to, I had an idea when you were talking about the drunk driving.
[02:48:57.878 --> 02:49:02.021]  Instead of mothers against drunk driving, maybe we should have mothers against government control.
[02:49:03.237 --> 02:49:04.238]  They named it Magic.
[02:49:05.099 --> 02:49:07.001]  But anyway... No, that's a good idea.
[02:49:07.161 --> 02:49:08.803]  Or Mothers Against Police States.
[02:49:09.443 --> 02:49:09.824]  Yeah.
[02:49:11.165 --> 02:49:12.686]  But I wanted to ask you a favor.
[02:49:13.127 --> 02:49:17.151]  There's a guy running for president under the Libertarian Party named Aaron Russo.
[02:49:17.251 --> 02:49:22.136]  He wants to close the borders, ensure the Second Amendment is still passed.
[02:49:22.156 --> 02:49:23.517]  Yeah, we've got him coming on the show.
[02:49:23.557 --> 02:49:25.179]  He's been on the network.
[02:49:25.934 --> 02:49:29.476]  Yeah, and has he been on your show recently?
[02:49:30.457 --> 02:49:33.398]  No, he's been on other people's shows and on the network.
[02:49:33.899 --> 02:49:35.640]  Right, I've heard him on Dave and Joyce.
[02:49:37.681 --> 02:49:45.025]  I know that the Libertarian Party Convention is in May, and he's probably going to win the nomination for the party.
[02:49:45.045 --> 02:49:46.426]  Good.
[02:49:46.446 --> 02:49:49.047]  I didn't know if you'd consider having it on or not.
[02:49:49.388 --> 02:49:53.210]  Yeah, I got phone numbers for him and stuff, and I guess they were wrong, but it's being set up.
[02:49:53.835 --> 02:49:54.435]  Okay, good.
[02:49:54.675 --> 02:49:56.376]  I look forward to that, and you take care, Alex.
[02:49:56.817 --> 02:49:58.397]  Hey, thanks a lot for the call, Michelle.
[02:49:59.178 --> 02:50:10.343]  We're going to break here in a few seconds, and then I'll come back and hit five or six articles I haven't covered and just briefly throw out the mailing address and phone number and websites to get the videos and the books and the materials.
[02:50:10.423 --> 02:50:14.025]  If you want to wake people up, folks, it starts at the grassroots.
[02:50:14.145 --> 02:50:15.506]  That's where you've got to take action.
[02:50:16.086 --> 02:50:21.129]  And it starts with the minds of men and women everywhere in all 50 states and worldwide.
[02:50:22.109 --> 02:50:23.230]  And I've made videos...
[02:50:23.886 --> 02:50:25.887]  Wake up 90% of those that see them.
[02:50:26.428 --> 02:50:28.369]  That's a tool everybody should be using.
[02:50:28.729 --> 02:50:30.070]  A proven, effective tool.
[02:50:30.130 --> 02:50:38.875]  So go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com Stop procrastinating.
[02:50:39.135 --> 02:50:40.236]  Order the videos.

[02:50:42.017 --> 02:50:42.377]  A day.
[02:50:42.437 --> 02:50:43.558]  And get them out to everybody.
[02:50:43.598 --> 02:50:44.078]  We'll be back.

[02:51:45.397 --> 02:51:49.740]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:51:49.920 --> 02:51:54.342]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:51:54.482 --> 02:51:58.844]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:51:58.904 --> 02:52:00.285]  The New World Order.
[02:52:01.005 --> 02:52:01.806]  Pan emerged.
[02:52:02.046 --> 02:52:06.251]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:52:06.311 --> 02:52:13.239]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:52:13.399 --> 02:52:15.402]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:52:15.762 --> 02:52:26.189]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:52:26.389 --> 02:52:31.773]  If you want to understand what the new rule of order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:52:52.568 --> 02:53:03.477]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:53:03.677 --> 02:53:03.997]  We're good to go.
[02:53:20.223 --> 02:53:20.723]  That's right.
[02:53:20.903 --> 02:53:28.025]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:53:28.305 --> 02:53:36.608]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:53:48.779 --> 02:53:54.922]  All right, my friends.
[02:53:57.123 --> 02:53:58.063]  Final segment.
[02:53:58.083 --> 02:53:59.504]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:53:59.564 --> 02:54:02.425]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central Standard Time.
[02:54:03.466 --> 02:54:07.188]  Government will track ID card use, as if we didn't already know that.
[02:54:07.508 --> 02:54:13.150]  And again, you go into the grocery store, and they say, oh, your stuff's going to be $25 more because you don't have our...
[02:54:14.918 --> 02:54:15.459]  We're good to go.
[02:54:15.479 --> 02:54:16.721]  We're good to go.
[02:54:29.855 --> 02:54:30.695]  And it's the same system.
[02:54:31.116 --> 02:54:32.937]  Government will track ID card use.
[02:54:32.977 --> 02:54:48.144]  The pattern of everyday use we make of our identity cards, known as the audit trail, will be logged and kept on a central computer to allow abuses to be investigated once the scheme is introduced by a senior home office official
[02:54:49.039 --> 02:55:05.507]  Indicated yesterday, Stephen Harrison, the head of the Home Office's Identity Card Policy Unit, said yesterday there was also plans to introduce mobile electronic fingerprint and eye scan units to allow elderly and infirm people in rural areas to register for identity cards without traveling long distances.
[02:55:06.107 --> 02:55:12.090]  And again, they make you in a lot of the stores in England, thumb scan to buy and sell, get into bars, get your driver's license.
[02:55:12.754 --> 02:55:19.036]  To buy gas, tracking what you buy and do, which is what the Total Information Awareness Network said it was all about.
[02:55:20.216 --> 02:55:24.538]  The Register reports NEC demo's big brother biometric phone booth.
[02:55:25.358 --> 02:55:33.941]  And it says the biometric team has developed a facial recognition algorithm they claim can match a captured image with a database with better accuracy than ever before.
[02:55:34.761 --> 02:55:38.222]  And they said they want to make you do this to use a phone booth.
[02:55:38.322 --> 02:55:39.823]  Make sure there's no fraud involved.
[02:55:39.963 --> 02:55:41.023]  It'll save children.
[02:55:41.969 --> 02:55:44.190]  Cameras to guard new city parks.
[02:55:44.210 --> 02:55:45.331]  They're going to guard you.
[02:55:46.031 --> 02:55:53.994]  Beginning with the Skate and Splash Park, all new city parks in Rogers will have an all-day, all-night patron, Big Brother.
[02:55:54.054 --> 02:55:57.736]  See, recasting Big Brother is loving and good.
[02:55:58.376 --> 02:56:06.020]  Parks Director Jim Welch said Monday morning at a special meeting of the Parks and Recreation Commission that a recent arson...
[02:56:06.994 --> 02:56:16.245]  Incident with the damage estimates exceeding 100,000 precipitated is directed to make surveillance cameras a part of future park plans.
[02:56:17.166 --> 02:56:21.071]  And it goes, it's like anything else if you know a camera's watching.
[02:56:22.350 --> 02:56:24.192]  It will keep honest people honest.
[02:56:24.552 --> 02:56:26.213]  Oh, guilty until proven innocent.
[02:56:26.614 --> 02:56:28.795]  And in Michigan, five years ago, they've been doing it.
[02:56:29.196 --> 02:56:32.939]  Cameras in most of the state bathrooms, and they admit over the toilets.
[02:56:33.479 --> 02:56:35.240]  Why, that'll stop vandalism.
[02:56:35.381 --> 02:56:39.044]  Don't have cops bust people that are doing stuff in the bathrooms.
[02:56:39.104 --> 02:56:42.126]  Just make, you know, we all, you know, keep you safe.
[02:56:42.166 --> 02:56:42.726]  Stop criminals.
[02:56:42.746 --> 02:56:43.207]  You know, it's good.
[02:56:44.557 --> 02:56:46.159]  Israel to kill in U.S.
[02:56:46.199 --> 02:56:47.040]  and allied nations.
[02:56:47.080 --> 02:56:48.722]  Nobody ever believes this when I mention it.
[02:56:49.162 --> 02:56:50.364]  So I thought I'd re-read this.
[02:56:50.524 --> 02:56:51.846]  United Press International, 115.03.
[02:56:55.240 --> 02:57:02.823]  Israel has embarked upon a more aggressive approach to the war on terror that will include staging targeted killings in the United States and other friendly countries.
[02:57:02.863 --> 02:57:07.185]  Former Israeli intelligence officials told United Press International it's already going on.
[02:57:07.605 --> 02:57:11.067]  Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has forbidden the practice until now.
[02:57:11.127 --> 02:57:16.609]  These sources said speaking in condition of anonymity, the Israeli statements were confined.
[02:57:17.479 --> 02:57:22.242]  Confirmed by more than a half-dozen former and currently serving U.S.
[02:57:22.282 --> 02:57:26.805]  foreign policy and intelligence officials in the interviews with United Press International.
[02:57:26.825 --> 02:57:40.033]  I just thought I'd mention that because, you know, I mean, if Israel will bomb the USS Liberty knowingly to blame it on Egypt with our government's blessing, imagine the very useful hit teams here domestically.
[02:57:41.727 --> 02:57:43.288]  Don't have time to cover the other stuff.
[02:57:43.388 --> 02:57:44.269]  It was incredible.
[02:57:44.329 --> 02:57:47.531]  But we'll get back to it tomorrow and back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:57:48.171 --> 02:57:50.833]  Be sure and tell your friends, your family, your neighbors about the show.
[02:57:50.993 --> 02:57:52.214]  Email your email list.

[02:58:02.980 --> 02:58:04.221]  We have the great guest on.

[02:58:23.059 --> 02:58:23.959]  God bless you all.
[02:58:23.979 --> 02:58:26.180]  Again, see you back tonight, back tomorrow.
[02:58:37.651 --> 02:58:42.153]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:58:42.493 --> 02:58:46.575]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:58:46.875 --> 02:58:47.435]  We listened.
[02:58:47.735 --> 02:58:52.717]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:58:52.997 --> 02:58:53.478]  We listened.
[02:58:53.858 --> 02:58:56.899]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:58:57.319 --> 02:58:57.859]  We listened.
[02:58:58.320 --> 02:59:01.481]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[02:59:01.721 --> 02:59:02.081]  We're good.
[02:59:28.231 --> 02:59:29.193]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:59:29.213 --> 02:59:30.796]  Not yet available in Iowa.
