[00:00:05.643 --> 00:00:09.826]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:11.286]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.047 --> 00:00:13.108]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.608 --> 00:00:17.310]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.873]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.285 --> 00:00:41.827]  All right, my friends, it's Tuesday, the 27th day of July 2004.
[00:00:41.867 --> 00:00:44.308]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:45.068 --> 00:00:48.989]  We're going to have wide open phones, and we do have some great guests coming up as well.
[00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.870]  I'm going to take a lot of calls early here in the first hour.
[00:00:52.510 --> 00:01:02.214]  The toll-free number to talk about the Democratic National Convention Theater, the Police State Theater training you how to be a slave,
[00:01:03.677 --> 00:01:08.438]  China threatening to attack Taiwan, as usual, but really massing a lot of troops and ships.
[00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:18.840]  Our own government saying that, oh, they're sure that Iran has the weapons of mass destruction now, and they're behind 9-11, so we need to invade them as well.
[00:01:21.021 --> 00:01:31.643]  It's all coming up, and in the second hour, we have Corey Graff, Executive Director, Wisconsin Gun Owners Incorporated, joining us.
[00:01:34.211 --> 00:01:36.553]  And it's par for the course.
[00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:42.137]  Oshkosh police conduct door-to-door gun confiscations.
[00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:56.928]  They went into an entire section of the city up in Wisconsin and at gunpoint had everyone come out and give them their guns.
[00:01:56.948 --> 00:01:59.069]  You're all guilty until proven innocent.
[00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.990]  No warrants.
[00:02:01.798 --> 00:02:04.339]  No probable cause, no nothing.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.881]  And they say, oh don't worry, you might get your guns back someday.
[00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:13.003]  So, this is the new freedom, just like they brought Iraq freedom.
[00:02:13.043 --> 00:02:17.646]  Gun confiscation, torture camps, torture masters appointed as their president.
[00:02:18.466 --> 00:02:21.247]  We're going to have the same thing I guess here in the United States.
[00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:24.989]  So, we will cover this article.
[00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:30.852]  I want to get back into that story that I barely got into in the third hour yesterday.
[00:02:31.915 --> 00:02:38.719]  about vaccines that, quote, stop you from being able to become addicted to drugs.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:53.909]  The problem is, is that narcotics affect the receptors in the nerve endings of the brain that, where your natural endorphins give you pleasure, happiness, euphoria.
[00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.331]  You won't be happy when your son or daughter is married.
[00:02:57.371 --> 00:02:59.072]  You won't be happy when you win the lottery.
[00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:02.841]  You won't be happy when you do a good job at work and get the raise.
[00:03:04.862 --> 00:03:11.425]  That's what they're not mentioning, but I, for years, have been aware of the development of this science, and they admit that's how it works.
[00:03:12.626 --> 00:03:16.848]  And England is about to pass a law to forcibly inject their children with this.
[00:03:17.268 --> 00:03:17.509]  Why?
[00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:18.909]  It'll stop drugs.
[00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.771]  Drugs hurts, you know, millions of people.
[00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:24.551]  Kills hundreds every year in England.
[00:03:24.591 --> 00:03:26.072]  Kills thousands every year here.
[00:03:26.792 --> 00:03:28.793]  Our government's looking at making you take them.
[00:03:29.113 --> 00:03:30.553]  By the way, you don't want to take them.
[00:03:30.573 --> 00:03:31.973]  They're going to put them in the food.
[00:03:33.054 --> 00:03:42.436]  And then, that's right, it's live virus bound to a protein that is needed in electrochemical brain activity.
[00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:46.017]  And so the virus goes and plugs into those tissues.
[00:03:47.388 --> 00:03:50.611]  And, oh, they've also got a vaccine for aggression.
[00:03:50.671 --> 00:03:53.153]  Why don't we give it an aggression vaccine?
[00:03:53.193 --> 00:03:54.674]  People won't be angry anymore.
[00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.917]  There's a reason we're supposed to be able to get angry!
[00:03:58.277 --> 00:03:59.778]  There's a reason for that!
[00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:07.865]  Oh man, folks, this is stranger than David Icke saying lizard people run the world, okay?
[00:04:08.385 --> 00:04:09.166]  I don't believe that.
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.381]  I don't believe in the flying saucers.
[00:04:12.421 --> 00:04:14.142]  I don't believe in the abominable snowman.
[00:04:14.562 --> 00:04:18.024]  But this is stranger and out in the open than that.
[00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:21.707]  The government says they're going to brain damage you.
[00:04:21.767 --> 00:04:24.148]  Give you a selective lobotomy.
[00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:27.570]  And they got a new movie coming out.
[00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.011]  Code 63, Code 64.
[00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:29.712]  I forget.
[00:04:29.752 --> 00:04:31.312]  I printed off the rundown of it.
[00:04:31.673 --> 00:04:33.694]  It's got the actor from the Shawshank Redemption in it.
[00:04:35.237 --> 00:04:49.382]  And in it, you know, he's this secret government agent, he takes these viruses that give him special mind powers, and all the cities are checkpoints, and everyone's rounded up in camps, and... So people will see that in a movie and think, well, it must be good to take that injection then.
[00:04:50.942 --> 00:04:53.183]  Folks, that's what this police state's all about.
[00:04:53.783 --> 00:04:59.205]  Once they get the men in black ski masks over our lives, they're gonna forcibly inject us with all this, and then we're gonna feel okay.
[00:04:59.225 --> 00:04:59.905]  We'll be one of them.
[00:05:01.184 --> 00:05:04.006]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[00:05:04.126 --> 00:05:04.967]  Michael Trudeau here.
[00:05:05.087 --> 00:05:08.390]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.254]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[00:05:14.375 --> 00:05:17.417]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[00:05:17.657 --> 00:05:21.919]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:24.040]  The chronic, everyday pain was miserable.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:31.224]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[00:05:31.424 --> 00:05:33.885]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[00:05:34.185 --> 00:05:36.847]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice.
[00:05:37.007 --> 00:05:38.508]  Only this time, it changed my life.
[00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:40.550]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement.
[00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.732]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[00:05:42.912 --> 00:05:45.374]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[00:05:45.414 --> 00:05:48.116]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[00:05:48.296 --> 00:05:48.836]  Side effects?
[00:05:49.016 --> 00:05:51.298]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[00:05:51.438 --> 00:05:52.919]  Call Kliscott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:53.179]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:54.580]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.221]  It worked for me.
[00:06:01.172 --> 00:06:01.952]  Terrorism!
[00:06:02.093 --> 00:06:02.833]  Terrorism!
[00:06:02.953 --> 00:06:09.016]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:06:09.276 --> 00:06:10.857]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:06:11.097 --> 00:06:13.578]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:13.978 --> 00:06:28.546]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:28.586 --> 00:06:28.906]  government.
[00:06:29.066 --> 00:06:30.867]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:06:31.247 --> 00:06:37.148]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:37.288 --> 00:06:41.789]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.
[00:06:42.049 --> 00:06:47.411]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:07:00.299 --> 00:07:07.144]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:07:07.445 --> 00:07:08.826]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:07:09.026 --> 00:07:11.228]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:07:11.388 --> 00:07:13.469]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:18.673]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:07:19.014 --> 00:07:23.057]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:07:23.297 --> 00:07:25.058]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:07:25.138 --> 00:07:35.781]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:07:35.941 --> 00:07:37.841]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:41.923]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns of the info war.
[00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:43.423]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533139.

[00:07:54.347 --> 00:07:55.108]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:08:00.891 --> 00:08:05.934]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.274 --> 00:08:08.616]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:13.278 --> 00:08:17.601]  That's right, my friends, there is a war on for your mind.
[00:08:19.002 --> 00:08:27.188]  The websites are infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, and now prisonplanet.tv.
[00:08:29.149 --> 00:08:33.292]  Coming up, we've got the head of one of the biggest Second Amendment groups in Wisconsin coming on.
[00:08:33.332 --> 00:08:35.514]  They're having door-to-door gun confiscations.
[00:08:35.934 --> 00:08:36.634]  All guns.
[00:08:36.714 --> 00:08:38.536]  They come in, they take all your firearms.
[00:08:40.277 --> 00:08:42.879]  And we have done a year in review.
[00:08:43.379 --> 00:08:46.441]  We don't usually do that in January or December.
[00:08:46.461 --> 00:08:47.542]  We do that in the middle of the summer.
[00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:54.686]  On PrisonPlanet.com, one of the stories posted was, court opens door to searchers without warrants.
[00:08:56.207 --> 00:09:05.277]  That was the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling, and it said that if we just want to come investigate your house for no reason, we can do it.
[00:09:05.297 --> 00:09:07.920]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[00:09:09.187 --> 00:09:11.329]  They're not just attacking the 4th or 5th Amendment.
[00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:18.356]  I mean, they tell the protesters, you can be under the train station, inside a cage, inside another cage.
[00:09:18.396 --> 00:09:18.776]  That's right.
[00:09:18.816 --> 00:09:22.039]  They've got 15 to 30 foot fences depending on what area.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.062]  Wire netting over that.
[00:09:26.067 --> 00:09:41.592]  So there's no way to get out, and then inside, a little 2,800 foot box, where the police lock you in, and that sends the message that you're a criminal, you're bad, you're some type of nutcase with three heads growing out of your nose, and you know, five eyeballs on the back of your head.
[00:09:43.393 --> 00:09:46.233]  And they're reporting that there's almost no protesters in Boston.
[00:09:46.293 --> 00:09:47.794]  Why, what a surprise!
[00:09:49.671 --> 00:10:00.656]  So, we're going to search your house without warrants, we're going to take your guns, we're going to put you in cages and side cages and aim machine guns at you, but the border is going to stay absolutely totally wide open.
[00:10:00.696 --> 00:10:02.217]  It is a complete and total joke.
[00:10:02.617 --> 00:10:15.924]  And then you look at who's behind the terrorism, it's the military-industrial complex, and they're using the fear to set up a police state and enslave us as their tools to invade foreign countries with the new draft that's coming ahead nicely.
[00:10:18.706 --> 00:10:24.452]  And I have this article here where they just go in and take everybody's firearms.
[00:10:26.094 --> 00:10:28.817]  Guilty until proven innocent up in Wisconsin.
[00:10:29.458 --> 00:10:38.848]  Remember two years ago, one of the city managers, the people were protesting and doing a recall vote.
[00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:42.650]  And so she said, well, let's just declare martial law.
[00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:43.411]  There's a problem.
[00:10:43.451 --> 00:10:46.931]  She said this on television in the live city council meeting.
[00:10:47.091 --> 00:10:49.452]  Let's have martial law like we've talked about in the past.
[00:10:49.492 --> 00:10:50.872]  You know, the plan.
[00:10:51.372 --> 00:10:53.272]  And they said, uh, you're not supposed to talk like that.
[00:10:53.292 --> 00:10:54.392]  That's executive session.
[00:10:54.412 --> 00:10:55.413]  This was all picked up.
[00:10:55.473 --> 00:10:57.853]  And they have those quotes in the Milwaukee Journal.
[00:10:59.553 --> 00:11:03.294]  You know, martial law, just what we've been getting ready for.
[00:11:03.354 --> 00:11:04.674]  Why don't we go ahead and do that now?
[00:11:06.194 --> 00:11:08.995]  Oh, would you like to tell us what you've been training with the feds to do, please?
[00:11:12.273 --> 00:11:14.214]  And again, it's all for your safety.
[00:11:14.495 --> 00:11:16.096]  All of this is for your safety.
[00:11:19.498 --> 00:11:20.919]  I mean, what's wrong with you?
[00:11:20.959 --> 00:11:24.461]  Don't you want to... Don't you want to be safe?
[00:11:24.842 --> 00:11:26.343]  Okay, now I'm really irritated.
[00:11:26.423 --> 00:11:27.744]  I had my, uh... Oh, here it is.
[00:11:27.804 --> 00:11:28.164]  I found it.
[00:11:28.884 --> 00:11:35.729]  I had my London Independent article yesterday that's still one of the top stories on InfoWars.com.
[00:11:35.969 --> 00:11:37.010]  It's a place to get this article.
[00:11:39.091 --> 00:11:44.553]  And I covered this some in the third hour, but I'm going to cover this now, and I want to talk about this with the listeners.
[00:11:44.814 --> 00:11:46.234]  I hope you'll call in about this.
[00:11:46.274 --> 00:11:52.797]  You're welcome to call in about any news story you want to discuss, any topic, any questions, any comments.
[00:11:52.877 --> 00:11:54.578]  If you want to yell at me, that's fine, too.
[00:11:56.659 --> 00:11:58.079]  I relish those type of calls.
[00:11:58.139 --> 00:12:06.623]  I remember many years ago, most of the callers did that, and now, here I am with a syndicated broadcast, not screening the calls, and almost no one calls in to disagree with me.
[00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:11.692]  Which shows that we've been waking people up in a big way.
[00:12:11.712 --> 00:12:12.612]  It's not just my show, though.
[00:12:12.652 --> 00:12:13.272]  It's other shows.
[00:12:15.974 --> 00:12:17.154]  So we'll get into this article.
[00:12:19.795 --> 00:12:21.076]  And we'll take your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:12:21.096 --> 00:12:21.296]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:12:31.471 --> 00:12:37.653]  I'm going to try to calm down as I read this article and slowly go over the different facets of why you should be concerned about this.
[00:12:37.673 --> 00:12:43.715]  I'll tell you what, let's just read the article paragraph by paragraph and let's go over it.
[00:12:46.775 --> 00:12:56.738]  Now again, I've been talking about this for years because medical journals, governments, the World Health Organization have been talking about it.
[00:12:56.758 --> 00:12:58.799]  They're going to make you take the AIDS vaccine
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.743]  They're going to make you take smallpox and anthrax vaccines.
[00:13:02.823 --> 00:13:12.692]  Bush finally got the funding and finally signed it for five billion dollars plus for the new BioShield program.
[00:13:12.752 --> 00:13:13.472]  Three dozen.
[00:13:14.453 --> 00:13:15.014]  Three dozen!
[00:13:15.474 --> 00:13:20.179]  Thirty-six level four bio weapons labs.
[00:13:20.739 --> 00:13:23.642]  And they admit it's for defense and offense, but the best defense is a good offense.
[00:13:24.442 --> 00:13:24.723]  And the
[00:13:26.064 --> 00:13:30.609]  Baltimore newspaper last year called them facilities that will produce thousands of gallons of liquid death.
[00:13:34.013 --> 00:13:44.646]  And these are places that make your race-specific bioweapons, your weaponized, uh, unsundry, uh, just devilish, uh, devilish things.
[00:13:47.052 --> 00:14:00.362]  And so that's going on, and they say there's going to be dozens of vaccines you're going to have to take, and there's been discussions now in the newspapers that, well, a growing group of people, upwards now of a third of the population in the U.S.
[00:14:00.402 --> 00:14:02.624]  is now against vaccination and is refusing to take it.
[00:14:03.664 --> 00:14:06.266]  Another third doesn't really trust it, but still takes it.
[00:14:07.187 --> 00:14:10.229]  And one third would drink pure cyanide in order to do so.
[00:14:10.289 --> 00:14:15.053]  It's like the Stanford psychological test they had, what, five, six years ago?
[00:14:17.077 --> 00:14:21.060]  Oh, and they had further tests years before that, but they redid them.
[00:14:21.921 --> 00:14:29.227]  And they found that about 75% of people in a psychological test, if they're ordered to, will kill people.
[00:14:30.668 --> 00:14:34.711]  They would have somebody chained up in a chair, looking through them through a one-way mirror.
[00:14:36.807 --> 00:14:40.088]  And they would tell them to administer shocks up to a lethal point.
[00:14:40.108 --> 00:14:41.969]  They would have the person flop around and scream.
[00:14:42.009 --> 00:14:50.191]  And just because they were ordered to do so by the professor and the average college student would kill people.
[00:14:50.231 --> 00:14:52.232]  What they believed was kill people.
[00:14:52.992 --> 00:14:59.934]  And they had other psychological tests at universities where they played the part of jail guards and you can get most people to engage in brutal forms of torture.
[00:15:01.293 --> 00:15:03.177]  You couldn't do this 50 years ago in America.
[00:15:03.217 --> 00:15:03.958]  They did tests like this.
[00:15:03.978 --> 00:15:07.105]  People wouldn't do it because they had morals, at least to some extent.
[00:15:07.827 --> 00:15:11.775]  Now, though, we're all having our morals warped to prepare us for this.
[00:15:13.832 --> 00:15:18.915]  And so when they say put people in camps, torture is good, Ann Coulter says put everyone in a cage.
[00:15:18.956 --> 00:15:22.038]  She says put all the Democrats in a cage, not just the protesters.
[00:15:22.098 --> 00:15:24.159]  She thinks that's a good thing.
[00:15:24.179 --> 00:15:29.523]  Of course, Ann Coulter says the Patriot Act's good, but when I confronted her on air, she said she hadn't read it.
[00:15:29.563 --> 00:15:30.884]  I said, well what about this subsection?
[00:15:31.184 --> 00:15:32.244]  What about that subsection?
[00:15:32.264 --> 00:15:33.685]  I didn't read her the subsection.
[00:15:33.705 --> 00:15:35.046]  She said, oh that's a conspiracy theory.
[00:15:36.187 --> 00:15:38.088]  We ought to go pull that out of the archives.
[00:15:38.128 --> 00:15:40.090]  That's at PrisonPlanet.com in the audio section.
[00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:41.771]  We ought to replay that interview.
[00:15:43.553 --> 00:15:45.174]  I think it's saved in internet format.
[00:15:45.214 --> 00:15:46.454]  It's pretty good audio.
[00:15:46.494 --> 00:15:53.736]  It's not as good as the stereo audio here on the show when it was live, but... You know, that was the most requested interview ever.
[00:15:53.796 --> 00:15:54.996]  We aired it a few other times.
[00:15:55.076 --> 00:16:00.198]  It's been about a year and a half since I had her on, but... The point is, is that she's a... She should go to Russia.
[00:16:00.598 --> 00:16:04.419]  But since she's got this Republican label, oh, she must be good.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.660]  But, uh, anyway, side issue.
[00:16:08.317 --> 00:16:12.260]  The point is, people, that you'd better be real concerned about what's happening.
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:18.385]  But getting back to vaccines that brain damage you, chemical biological lobotomies.
[00:16:19.746 --> 00:16:24.429]  The British government is moving to pass a law to vaccinate all the children.
[00:16:24.449 --> 00:16:32.856]  And they said, OK, well, since 90 plus percent of you, I said a third in the US, but it's 90 plus percent now in major polls in England, don't trust the vaccines.
[00:16:33.656 --> 00:16:36.859]  We're not going to let you have health care, because everything is socialized health care.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:38.880]  This is, again, a bit in the news.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.221]  All of this is documented, folks.
[00:16:40.821 --> 00:16:43.541]  Unless you take all the vaccines.
[00:16:43.601 --> 00:16:47.322]  It's not the law, but you've got to take the vaccines or no health care.
[00:16:48.562 --> 00:16:49.203]  Kind of like here.
[00:16:49.223 --> 00:16:50.963]  Well, you've got to take the vaccines or no public school.
[00:16:51.583 --> 00:16:54.484]  Well, really, there's a waiver in their drawer, but they don't like to tell you that.
[00:16:55.704 --> 00:16:57.564]  And this is being proposed here in the U.S., too.
[00:16:57.604 --> 00:17:00.145]  We're usually about three, four years behind England.
[00:17:02.415 --> 00:17:05.338]  And some areas were ahead of them, putting protesters in cages.
[00:17:05.938 --> 00:17:08.661]  Children to get jabs against drug addiction.
[00:17:08.741 --> 00:17:08.961]  Why?
[00:17:09.001 --> 00:17:09.982]  That sounds good.
[00:17:10.022 --> 00:17:13.545]  My child will never be addicted to narcotics.
[00:17:13.605 --> 00:17:26.176]  The problem is the very receptors that give you feelings of pleasure from your natural endorphins after you run three or four miles, after you, you know, make a basket, that final basket winning the game.
[00:17:28.039 --> 00:17:46.367]  Of course you're playing you know when you're playing basketball or when you knock that one-in-a-lifetime hole-in-one on one of the big courses or let's talk about serious issues you know when you have your first child your second child when you get married when you get the big promotion
[00:17:47.276 --> 00:17:51.379]  You can forget it, folks, because they admit this plugs those up!
[00:17:51.459 --> 00:17:55.201]  They're actually going to make everyone take it!
[00:17:55.301 --> 00:17:56.502]  Ha ha ha ha!
[00:17:56.582 --> 00:17:57.443]  Ha ha ha ha!
[00:17:57.503 --> 00:17:58.403]  Ha ha ha ha!
[00:17:58.484 --> 00:17:59.144]  Oh my goodness!
[00:18:00.145 --> 00:18:00.585]  Ha ha ha!
[00:18:01.365 --> 00:18:03.787]  Uh, children to get jabs against drug addiction.
[00:18:03.827 --> 00:18:05.628]  Ministers consider vaccination scheme.
[00:18:05.929 --> 00:18:10.191]  Heroin, cocaine, and nicotine targeted because it's all the similar receptors.
[00:18:10.892 --> 00:18:12.753]  A radical scheme to vaccinate children.
[00:18:12.773 --> 00:18:15.975]  But see, then you'll have to have a drug that makes you feel good that gets other receptors.
[00:18:15.995 --> 00:18:17.056]  See, that's gonna be the reason.
[00:18:18.087 --> 00:18:20.629]  Oh, there was a little side effect, but you can all take the drug now.
[00:18:21.629 --> 00:18:29.514]  A radical scheme to vaccinate children against future drug addiction is being considered by ministers the Independent on Sunday can reveal.
[00:18:30.475 --> 00:18:33.516]  Under the plans, doctors would immunize children at risk.
[00:18:33.616 --> 00:18:34.597]  See, the poor kids first.
[00:18:34.657 --> 00:18:35.558]  Oh, you're at risk for drugs.
[00:18:35.918 --> 00:18:36.818]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[00:18:37.579 --> 00:18:45.884]  Can you imagine in the Soviet Union they would have injected prisoners with brain-altering vaccines and it would have been unbelievable tyranny, but here it's like, oh, it's good, it's freedom.
[00:18:46.701 --> 00:18:50.404]  Under the plans, doctors would immunize children at risk of becoming smokers.
[00:18:50.624 --> 00:18:51.425]  Oh, smokers!
[00:18:52.106 --> 00:18:53.807]  Or drug users with an injection.
[00:18:54.488 --> 00:19:00.432]  The scheme could operate in a similar way to current nationwide measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination programs.
[00:19:00.953 --> 00:19:07.158]  If your parent is a long-time smoker, that shows that you have a tendency towards nicotine addiction and you will be vaccinated.
[00:19:07.842 --> 00:19:12.625]  Childhood immunization would provide adults with protection from the euphoria.
[00:19:12.925 --> 00:19:14.906]  Oh, don't want those receptors available.
[00:19:15.406 --> 00:19:23.490]  That is, I'm having euphoria right now because I love my family and I'm fighting this and I'm so honored to be on the air fighting these people that my brain tells me good job.
[00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.472]  Good job for being a man and standing up against the New World Order.
[00:19:26.892 --> 00:19:29.213]  But I wouldn't feel like this if I'd had the shot.
[00:19:30.394 --> 00:19:36.117]  Childhood immunization would provide adults with protection from the euphoria that is experienced by users.
[00:19:37.401 --> 00:19:40.622]  Making drugs such as heroin, cocaine, pointless to take.
[00:19:41.202 --> 00:19:46.684]  Such vaccinations are being developed by pharmacological companies and are due to hit the market within two years.
[00:19:47.524 --> 00:19:50.165]  And it says the British government's considering making you take it.
[00:19:51.785 --> 00:19:52.325]  Yes!
[00:19:52.345 --> 00:19:54.866]  We're gonna plug up all those pleasure receptors!
[00:19:55.606 --> 00:19:57.487]  That's a real good idea!
[00:19:57.507 --> 00:19:58.247]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.838 --> 00:20:02.819]  It's finally here!
[00:20:02.959 --> 00:20:03.959]  Spring has arrived!
[00:20:04.139 --> 00:20:07.100]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:20:07.321 --> 00:20:10.782]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:20:10.982 --> 00:20:19.146]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:07.097]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:21:07.458 --> 00:21:11.521]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:21:11.821 --> 00:21:12.381]  We listened.
[00:21:12.681 --> 00:21:17.665]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:21:17.945 --> 00:21:18.426]  We listened.
[00:21:18.806 --> 00:21:21.848]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:21:22.268 --> 00:21:22.789]  We listened.
[00:21:23.269 --> 00:21:27.332]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:21:27.713 --> 00:21:28.193]  We listened.
[00:21:28.553 --> 00:21:33.757]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:21:34.198 --> 00:21:35.559]  Again, we listened.
[00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:43.305]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.

[00:23:02.618 --> 00:23:03.740]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:07.345]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:23:07.445 --> 00:23:07.885]  Phenol!
[00:23:08.186 --> 00:23:15.275]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:23:15.816 --> 00:23:19.700]  The FDA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:20.261]  Fragrance?
[00:23:20.641 --> 00:23:25.406]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:23:25.526 --> 00:23:30.231]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[00:23:30.451 --> 00:23:32.874]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[00:23:33.254 --> 00:23:36.655]  Well, like all of the products from the Kalben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.

[00:24:09.394 --> 00:24:12.716]  I'm going to get to the gun confiscation in Wisconsin going on.
[00:24:14.377 --> 00:24:18.700]  And how they're going to give you and your family a vaccine that totally takes control of your mind.
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:20.442]  Now they say aggression vaccines.
[00:24:20.482 --> 00:24:21.742]  You won't be angry anymore.
[00:24:22.403 --> 00:24:26.606]  The men in black uniforms in black combat gear pull up, hit you with a
[00:24:27.282 --> 00:24:33.447]  Magnetic pulse weapon knocks everybody out in the house, and they come in and give you your shots, and you're not mad at them anymore.
[00:24:33.487 --> 00:24:35.508]  You're joining the New World Order!
[00:24:36.129 --> 00:24:37.250]  Folks, I'm not joking.
[00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:38.731]  It's actually going to come to that.
[00:24:38.751 --> 00:24:39.391]  Do you understand?
[00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:44.976]  And of course, they'll have special injections for themselves, where they'll have plenty of aggression.
[00:24:45.036 --> 00:24:50.780]  The Defense Department says in the future it isn't what weapons armies have, but what drugs they're on!
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:55.864]  Mr. Marshall, the head futurist of the Pentagon, told Wired Magazine last year.
[00:24:57.569 --> 00:24:59.290]  That looks like Dr. Evil, you ought to see him.
[00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:01.932]  Let's go to some calls and we'll get back into all this.
[00:25:02.072 --> 00:25:03.633]  Let's go quickly to the calls today.
[00:25:03.653 --> 00:25:05.694]  Ed in Utah, welcome sir!
[00:25:06.234 --> 00:25:12.418]  Thank you very much Alex, and thanks for keeping the focus on that razor wire internment camp there in the Democrat Convention in Boston.
[00:25:12.598 --> 00:25:13.579]  Well, it's all part of freedom.
[00:25:13.919 --> 00:25:14.639]  Well, there you go.
[00:25:14.699 --> 00:25:17.121]  In fact, I want to comment about that, but first just a note.
[00:25:17.661 --> 00:25:20.363]  It's not getting out there too much that the nation of New Zealand
[00:25:20.854 --> 00:25:22.415]  Has cut off diplomatic relations.
[00:25:22.475 --> 00:25:29.478]  They caught a bunch of Israeli spies and a passport scam and they always catch Israel supplying the Muslim extremists because they work for them.
[00:25:29.918 --> 00:25:32.879]  Exactly, and where I'm going with this... It's all part of the freedom.
[00:25:33.239 --> 00:25:34.340]  Yep, you got it Alex.
[00:25:34.764 --> 00:25:37.205]  Where I'm going with this is a man that you've had on.
[00:25:37.525 --> 00:25:39.466]  They're now trying to intimidate the newspapers.
[00:25:39.887 --> 00:25:40.587]  Well, there you go.
[00:25:40.607 --> 00:25:43.168]  I have that out of the Sunday Morning Herald.
[00:25:43.188 --> 00:25:46.490]  They're trying to intimidate and tell the newspaper editors to shut up.
[00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:48.191]  Yeah, they've done that a lot.
[00:25:48.231 --> 00:25:54.274]  Like the Jacksonville paper did report what the American Free Press did about the Israeli spies caught.
[00:25:54.654 --> 00:25:59.817]  They closed down the base at Kings Naval Base there in South Georgia.
[00:26:00.442 --> 00:26:05.678]  And, uh, they had, uh, the base commander, or the spokesman, Ed Busick, can confirm this.
[00:26:05.718 --> 00:26:08.405]  For three hours, they caught these Israeli spies...
[00:26:09.231 --> 00:26:12.373]  Uh, who are out of Miami with false passports, false IDs.
[00:26:12.413 --> 00:26:14.494]  There's no Israeli spies!
[00:26:14.574 --> 00:26:19.116]  I mean, uh, I mean, uh, uh, Shiroge has said that he, quote, owns the Congress.
[00:26:19.217 --> 00:26:20.297]  Well, there you go.
[00:26:20.397 --> 00:26:26.380]  And on top of it, I mean, he's only said he'll kill Americans whenever he wants in America.
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:26.661]  Yeah.
[00:26:26.921 --> 00:26:34.785]  Well, while we're on it, uh, the American Free Press, uh, uh, Michael Piper, who you've had on before, uh, he's drawing a distinction in his new book.
[00:26:34.805 --> 00:26:36.726]  Uh, have you read it, uh, The High Priest of War?
[00:26:37.324 --> 00:26:38.424]  No, I haven't, but I've heard about it.
[00:26:38.524 --> 00:26:40.665]  Let me tell you, and here's my point of the call.
[00:26:41.445 --> 00:26:47.867]  He exposes each and every one of these neoconservatives as the former Trotskyites that they were.
[00:26:48.327 --> 00:26:54.148]  They brought in Primakov, the former head of the KGB, as you know, and I think we're seeing the fruit starting in the Democrats.
[00:26:54.168 --> 00:26:58.529]  Well, that was the United Press International, former head of the KGB, to help run things.
[00:26:58.609 --> 00:27:00.150]  I mean, what's wrong with that?
[00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.710]  There you go.
[00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:05.511]  I mean, Bush's daughters just said that they just love and admire Putin.
[00:27:06.091 --> 00:27:06.832]  Exactly, Alex.
[00:27:06.872 --> 00:27:11.957]  And I'm getting a little disturbed and impatient with these Republicans out there that would call you and I now.
[00:27:11.977 --> 00:27:14.219]  Well, we're communists because we're against Primakov.
[00:27:14.239 --> 00:27:15.881]  We're against the KGB running America.
[00:27:15.961 --> 00:27:16.422]  Exactly.
[00:27:16.482 --> 00:27:19.905]  They are so dumbed down and they have that sneering look on their face.
[00:27:19.965 --> 00:27:22.568]  They are imbued with the arrogance of ignorance.
[00:27:23.027 --> 00:27:28.431]  And they don't even notice these neocon mouthpieces don't want to point to this razor wire fence area.
[00:27:28.551 --> 00:27:36.737]  Well, so what if the Toronto Star and even the Washington Post admit that the Communist Fourth International founded the neocons?
[00:27:36.797 --> 00:27:40.400]  And so what if they hired Primakov two years ago and he's helping set up things?
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:40.980]  Exactly.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.481]  I mean, hold on.
[00:27:42.941 --> 00:27:46.424]  Isn't that freedom when the former head of the KGB helps destroy America?
[00:27:46.764 --> 00:27:48.484]  Well, I think you raise a good point there.
[00:27:48.624 --> 00:27:52.485]  And when you go... Oh, by the way, the police and people out there, that was in United Press International.
[00:27:52.666 --> 00:27:53.826]  We're not joking, okay?
[00:27:53.906 --> 00:27:55.366]  This is really happening!
[00:27:55.806 --> 00:28:03.288]  Those wire services are covering these stories, but only the American Free Press newspaper and people such as you on the air are getting it out.
[00:28:03.308 --> 00:28:05.849]  Well, I don't know why you have a problem with the former head of the KGB.
[00:28:05.889 --> 00:28:06.169]  Take care.
[00:28:06.189 --> 00:28:07.329]  I think he's a wonderful person.
[00:28:07.409 --> 00:28:08.409]  I agree with the Bush daughters.
[00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:09.750]  I love Putin.
[00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:10.490]  He's so good.
[00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:11.750]  Anthony in Louisiana.
[00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:12.470]  Anthony, go ahead.
[00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:12.991]  You're on the air.
[00:28:13.011 --> 00:28:14.071]  Hi, Alex.
[00:28:15.463 --> 00:28:24.431]  To talk about your gun thing today, I don't think that it's going to happen that we're actually going to win the gun battle, I think, for definitely.
[00:28:24.451 --> 00:28:26.092]  I think handing our guns in is good.
[00:28:26.132 --> 00:28:26.752]  I think it's freedom.
[00:28:27.193 --> 00:28:37.281]  Well, I mean, even from a societal, sociological viewpoint, most of us now are getting to the point where we haven't played in the woods when we were growing up, have BB guns.
[00:28:38.002 --> 00:28:39.743]  Most of us are not hunting anymore.
[00:28:39.883 --> 00:28:43.826]  That's why two, three years ago, March 25, 2000, excuse me, almost four years ago,
[00:28:45.433 --> 00:28:51.434]  Josh Sugarman of Violence Policy Center said, we've got your children, it was in the Statesman here in Austin, we are going to ban guns.
[00:28:51.474 --> 00:28:53.095]  We're teaching them that guns are going to be illegal.
[00:28:53.115 --> 00:28:54.675]  Okay, yeah.
[00:28:54.795 --> 00:28:55.435]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:55.495 --> 00:29:05.918]  And the other thing was, now I'm having a problem with some of the logic behind what's claimed about the VNS, the voter news services, and the die-ball machines.
[00:29:06.374 --> 00:29:10.316]  If it really is rigged, then why are they even bothering to have two people run?
[00:29:10.756 --> 00:29:13.217]  Do they know what the outcome is going to be?
[00:29:13.257 --> 00:29:14.898]  Well, they've got to keep the illusion going.
[00:29:14.938 --> 00:29:15.318]  What do you mean?
[00:29:15.358 --> 00:29:17.159]  Why does a carnival barker still bark?
[00:29:17.199 --> 00:29:22.321]  I mean... Well, how do you think that they decide amongst themselves who's going to take it?
[00:29:23.182 --> 00:29:24.802]  Well, the Bilderberg Group decides that.
[00:29:25.583 --> 00:29:25.863]  Okay.
[00:29:25.943 --> 00:29:27.124]  As the New York Times said.
[00:29:27.144 --> 00:29:28.064]  Alright.
[00:29:28.084 --> 00:29:28.584]  Alright, thanks.
[00:29:28.944 --> 00:29:29.485]  Anything else?
[00:29:29.525 --> 00:29:30.005]  Great points.
[00:29:30.025 --> 00:29:30.805]  I appreciate the call.
[00:29:32.026 --> 00:29:34.707]  But anybody that talks bad about Primakov, I'm hanging up on you.
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:39.542]  A man involved in the roundups of hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:29:39.562 --> 00:29:41.043]  A man who was brutal.
[00:29:41.963 --> 00:29:43.824]  The KGB is good.
[00:29:44.685 --> 00:29:46.106]  Patriots are bad.
[00:29:46.346 --> 00:29:46.706]  Okay?
[00:29:47.266 --> 00:29:47.827]  It's real simple.
[00:29:47.987 --> 00:29:50.408]  Hand in your firearms.
[00:29:51.589 --> 00:29:52.530]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:54.591]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.511 --> 00:29:58.193]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.388 --> 00:30:06.513]  I'm a nurse and I injured my back and I've lost 22 pounds and 9 inches.
[00:30:06.793 --> 00:30:08.935]  I would definitely recommend Vim and Vigor.
[00:30:09.455 --> 00:30:14.059]  As far as losing weight, Vim and Vigor is the best investment I ever made.
[00:30:14.359 --> 00:30:15.761]  It actually works.
[00:30:16.161 --> 00:30:19.564]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[00:30:19.624 --> 00:30:21.145]  I've tried many, many products.
[00:30:21.286 --> 00:30:23.527]  I have never experienced anything like Collagenated.
[00:30:23.928 --> 00:30:27.571]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than 8 weeks.
[00:30:27.971 --> 00:30:28.632]  It truly works.
[00:30:28.956 --> 00:30:30.137]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[00:30:30.517 --> 00:30:36.259]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:30:36.319 --> 00:30:42.142]  Vim and Vigor's collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[00:30:42.282 --> 00:30:44.863]  Vim and Vigor's collagenate really does work.
[00:30:45.223 --> 00:30:46.285]  It's healthy for you, too.
[00:30:46.445 --> 00:30:47.466]  Call Vim and Vigor today.
[00:30:47.486 --> 00:30:47.726]  1-800-622-FIN.
[00:30:47.806 --> 00:30:48.007]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:30:48.067 --> 00:30:49.348]  Get $25 off a 3-month supply of collagenate.
[00:30:49.368 --> 00:30:49.869]  So call now.
[00:30:49.889 --> 00:30:50.009]  1-800-622-FIN.
[00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.229]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[00:31:01.483 --> 00:31:04.505]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:31:04.825 --> 00:31:09.748]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:10.008 --> 00:31:14.370]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:23.575]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.775 --> 00:31:27.397]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.677 --> 00:31:32.720]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.743]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:40.224 --> 00:31:40.764]  What about you?
[00:31:41.517 --> 00:31:46.879]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:31:46.939 --> 00:31:48.020]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:49.941]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.551 --> 00:32:03.832]  My family's breathing easier, and now you can too!
[00:32:04.032 --> 00:32:07.393]  Hey folks, Michael Trudell here to tell you about the Biozone Air Purifier.
[00:32:07.473 --> 00:32:09.694]  The Biozone Air Purifier is not a filter system.
[00:32:09.854 --> 00:32:15.837]  It works at the molecular level, binding the small bits of dust, allergens, and other particles in your air into clumps that are too heavy to float.
[00:32:16.037 --> 00:32:18.598]  They fall harmlessly to the floor to be literally swept away.
[00:32:18.878 --> 00:32:19.538]  Nothing escapes!
[00:32:19.638 --> 00:32:23.880]  The Biozone Air Purifier also kills virus and bacteria germs and totally removes odors.
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.681]  Out on the farm we have several cats and two big dogs, so pet odors can be a concern.
[00:32:27.781 --> 00:32:30.002]  But like the odors from anything else, simply gone.
[00:32:30.282 --> 00:32:30.582]  Smoke?
[00:32:30.822 --> 00:32:32.684]  My wife and I don't, but several of our friends do.
[00:32:32.864 --> 00:32:35.926]  Our BioZone Air Purifier clears out that smoke literally within minutes.
[00:32:36.146 --> 00:32:40.249]  I use it myself, and I'm telling you, your BioZone Air Purifier will improve the air in your home.
[00:32:40.409 --> 00:32:43.071]  It even comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee and free shipping.
[00:32:43.251 --> 00:32:46.033]  Call toll-free, 888-88-MY-AIR today.
[00:32:46.133 --> 00:32:48.474]  That's 1-888-88-MY-AIR.
[00:32:48.574 --> 00:32:51.536]  Or visit www.purifymyair.com.
[00:32:51.616 --> 00:32:53.257]  That's purifymyair.com.
[00:32:53.438 --> 00:32:56.780]  Order yours today, and you'll get a bathroom ionizer of $40 value, free!
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.842]  Get your BioZone Air Purifier today, and you'll be breathing easier, too.
[00:33:06.344 --> 00:33:08.245]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.745 --> 00:33:11.566]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:18.068 --> 00:33:23.770]  Just a few weeks ago I was digging through giant stacks of news articles that I've covered on air.
[00:33:24.807 --> 00:33:40.316]  And there was the United Press International article from two and a half years ago about Primakov, the former KGB general, head of the KGB, hired by Homeland Security to help advise them on the internal passport to set things up.
[00:33:40.356 --> 00:33:50.662]  And then I found another report with Colin Powell in Russia and talking about, well, you know, we've got our internal passport via the Social Security system.
[00:33:50.682 --> 00:33:52.143]  You need to get one here in Russia.
[00:33:53.271 --> 00:33:55.372]  And a caller mentions something like that.
[00:33:55.412 --> 00:33:57.894]  It's hard to believe, but all of this is hard to believe.
[00:33:58.755 --> 00:34:01.897]  It's hard to believe they've ruled there's no Fourth Amendment, there's no First Amendment.
[00:34:02.437 --> 00:34:06.360]  It's hard to believe all of this is happening, but it's the nature of tyranny.
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:13.024]  It's hard to believe they're going to try forcible inoculation of vaccines that purposefully brain damage you.
[00:34:13.204 --> 00:34:14.365]  I'm going to get into that more later.
[00:34:14.985 --> 00:34:21.870]  It's hard to believe they've got protesters under the train station where no one can see them, inside another cage, surrounded by another cage.
[00:34:22.794 --> 00:34:33.498]  It's hard to believe that Bush and Carrier cousins, members of the same secret society, it's hard to believe that the New York Times admits that the Bilderberg Group chose John Edwards.
[00:34:33.619 --> 00:34:34.559]  I can't believe they did it.
[00:34:34.619 --> 00:34:35.419]  Two different articles.
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:39.261]  It's hard to believe that he went on Larry King Live and bragged about it.
[00:34:40.321 --> 00:34:40.902]  Mr. Cherry did.
[00:34:42.609 --> 00:34:53.055]  It's hard to believe that the New York Post admits that there's, you know, homosexual porn stars and people at the Bohemian Grove, quote, servicing the Grove members.
[00:34:53.435 --> 00:34:56.037]  It's all just being thrown in our faces now.
[00:34:57.558 --> 00:34:58.838]  And you know why that's happening?
[00:34:58.878 --> 00:35:00.920]  Because we won the fight of information.
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:02.861]  And again, I'll say this and then we'll go to your calls.
[00:35:03.561 --> 00:35:05.742]  I've done over 1,600 radio interviews.
[00:35:05.762 --> 00:35:06.543]  I've got to count them up.
[00:35:06.583 --> 00:35:07.563]  I think I've almost done 1,700 now.
[00:35:10.402 --> 00:35:12.824]  I did a couple of interviews this morning, a couple last night.
[00:35:12.864 --> 00:35:16.627]  I was on the number one show in the Midwest, Man Cow, for 45 minutes.
[00:35:16.647 --> 00:35:17.428]  He never does that.
[00:35:17.848 --> 00:35:21.711]  They had... What's that guy's name?
[00:35:21.731 --> 00:35:22.612]  I can't remember his name.
[00:35:22.652 --> 00:35:29.517]  They had Denzel Washington and a couple other people waiting on hold while I went on and on about the New World Order.
[00:35:29.657 --> 00:35:30.538]  It's getting really weird.
[00:35:34.437 --> 00:35:42.739]  The point here is, is that I've done sixteen hundred plus radio interviews and we'll take ten, twenty, thirty calls, nobody calls in disagreeing.
[00:35:43.359 --> 00:35:45.239]  And I know you've heard that, I say that a couple times a week.
[00:35:45.639 --> 00:35:45.799]  Why?
[00:35:45.819 --> 00:35:47.420]  Because it's the best news I can give you folks.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:53.541]  We go in five, six years from half the callers disagreeing on my own talk show on one station.
[00:35:54.121 --> 00:35:58.822]  Now we're on dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of AM and FM stations, shortwave internet,
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:05.802]  Almost no one calls in to disagree unless they say I'm not hardcore enough or something, or, you know, I don't think it's this group or that group running things.
[00:36:06.582 --> 00:36:08.203]  But it's other people's broadcast.
[00:36:08.743 --> 00:36:17.146]  So, see, I've done my own real poll, people, and so the globalists try to lie, the Bilderberg Group doesn't exist, the UN doesn't run the Supreme Court,
[00:36:18.522 --> 00:36:26.426]  There is no plan to take your guns, and because that we hurt them very badly because they would lie, we would show the documents, they would lose credibility.
[00:36:26.826 --> 00:36:33.490]  Everybody saw happen, develop what we said would happen, and now our credibility is at all-time highs.
[00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:38.092]  And so, they're now just admitting it all, but saying, so what?
[00:36:38.272 --> 00:36:39.273]  Yeah, it's world government.
[00:36:39.573 --> 00:36:40.593]  It's for your safety.
[00:36:41.414 --> 00:36:47.437]  Now we've got to discredit that, expose who's behind 9-11, expose who's going to be behind the next terror attacks, who has the motive,
[00:36:48.184 --> 00:36:50.005]  And it's over for the globalists.
[00:36:50.506 --> 00:36:54.088]  The number one song in the country says the government carried out 9-11.
[00:36:54.809 --> 00:36:57.170]  Number one, folks, now for what, three weeks?
[00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:58.831]  I checked it again last night.
[00:36:59.512 --> 00:37:01.533]  Number one song in the country.
[00:37:02.013 --> 00:37:04.695]  Globalists have got to be worried, people.
[00:37:06.596 --> 00:37:09.738]  You just can't keep the truth down, okay?
[00:37:09.999 --> 00:37:10.599]  But listen.
[00:37:12.139 --> 00:37:34.533]  I want you to understand that the globalists may nuke a city, may release smallpox, blame it on Iran, clamp down martial law, grab people like myself, and at the point that happens, you, police officers, firemen, military, when they tell you to go out and rubber bullet demonstrators, and when they're taking people's pension funds, when they tell you not to protest, you've just got to not follow orders.
[00:37:35.399 --> 00:37:36.841]  Because this is an illegitimate government.
[00:37:36.861 --> 00:37:43.390]  It's like if the government said, black people are slaves, put them in cages, you know, you'd say, no, that's ridiculous, I'm not following that order.
[00:37:44.391 --> 00:37:45.373]  Well, it's the same thing with this.
[00:37:45.393 --> 00:37:48.637]  You know, if they say arrest people, put them in camps, just say no!
[00:37:49.759 --> 00:37:50.119]  Okay?
[00:37:50.259 --> 00:37:51.782]  And again, I go back to
[00:37:53.399 --> 00:37:59.466]  The facts here, that I read articles last week, mainstream news, where they put a G.I.
[00:37:59.506 --> 00:38:03.570]  in a room in England or the U.S., nerve gas them, kill them.
[00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:07.615]  They tell the young volunteer, you want to volunteer to test the common flu for your country?
[00:38:07.635 --> 00:38:08.095]  Yes sir!
[00:38:08.396 --> 00:38:12.741]  You know, good, well-meaning, salt-of-the-earth people who believe in their country and their government.
[00:38:12.921 --> 00:38:13.842]  And they just kill you!
[00:38:14.935 --> 00:38:18.458]  They just killed people on the New York subway back in 1968 and there have been many other cases.
[00:38:18.478 --> 00:38:24.303]  They just had light bulbs that released a bioweapon, killed people, had army doctors at the hospitals to monitor what it did.
[00:38:25.324 --> 00:38:28.446]  Why do you serve globalists that have this mindset?
[00:38:28.526 --> 00:38:29.747]  Why do you go along with it?
[00:38:30.748 --> 00:38:33.911]  So I'm going to be flat out with people.
[00:38:33.991 --> 00:38:35.312]  We are entering this thing.
[00:38:35.332 --> 00:38:38.415]  The globalists are moving at light speed.
[00:38:39.582 --> 00:38:52.091]  And their program is falling apart, but it's got so much momentum that the wreck of the New World Order, the confused, out-of-control, jumbled mess, is still going to collide with us.
[00:38:54.293 --> 00:39:01.378]  And I just pray that all of you will stand up, black, white, old, young, and just say no to this system.
[00:39:01.638 --> 00:39:02.619]  I want to hear from police.
[00:39:02.719 --> 00:39:03.700]  I want to hear from military.
[00:39:05.126 --> 00:39:23.773]  I mean, I want to know what you think about the fact that they're going to try to forcibly inject you and your family with a drug, with a vaccine, with a virus that creates proteins in your endorphin uptake receptors, and will make you basically a zombie.
[00:39:23.853 --> 00:39:25.913]  I mean, I'm reading the London Independent here.
[00:39:25.973 --> 00:39:26.914]  They're going to do it.
[00:39:28.294 --> 00:39:30.895]  They've already got 10% of the population on these drugs.
[00:39:31.635 --> 00:39:33.316]  Now they're going to use viruses to do it.
[00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:37.051]  Folks, you can't make stuff up like this!
[00:39:37.172 --> 00:39:44.016]  I'm living in a Twilight Zone, Outer Limits, Alfred Hitchcock movie, but it's real!
[00:39:44.836 --> 00:39:46.497]  It's really happening!
[00:39:48.118 --> 00:39:49.479]  Okay, let's go quickly to the calls.
[00:39:49.599 --> 00:39:52.501]  Emmett in Pennsylvania, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:39:53.462 --> 00:39:55.123]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:39:55.943 --> 00:39:59.665]  WWCR is not coming in too well in Pennsylvania today.
[00:40:00.366 --> 00:40:03.868]  There's another preacher on WWCR and he made the comment
[00:40:04.295 --> 00:40:11.191]  There's a talk show host that's trying to cause such dissatisfaction among the American people with their government.
[00:40:12.267 --> 00:40:13.268]  Could he have met you?
[00:40:13.628 --> 00:40:14.869]  Well, I don't really care, sir.
[00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:16.191]  It's not about Alex Jones.
[00:40:16.691 --> 00:40:20.215]  It's about reading the Associated Press saying there's no Fourth Amendment.
[00:40:20.615 --> 00:40:27.361]  It's about pointing out that the government is wide open, that the border is wide open, while they're telling us that we've got to have cameras in our neighborhoods.
[00:40:27.622 --> 00:40:29.623]  It's about cameras in school bathrooms.
[00:40:29.864 --> 00:40:30.744]  How is that freedom?
[00:40:31.005 --> 00:40:32.346]  It's about real issues.
[00:40:32.406 --> 00:40:37.531]  It's not about me, and it's not about people that are envious of the fact that we are reaching millions of people.
[00:40:37.751 --> 00:40:39.633]  Well, he had advertised his newsletter.
[00:40:39.753 --> 00:40:42.795]  Well, sir, listen, listen, listen, no, and I'm sure they're not talking about me.
[00:40:43.116 --> 00:40:47.199]  The point is, sir, I do not, listen, I do not want to get into infighting and stuff.
[00:40:47.239 --> 00:40:50.462]  We've moved, all the other shows, or most of them, like to fight with each other.
[00:40:50.482 --> 00:40:51.783]  I don't do it.
[00:40:52.543 --> 00:40:52.984]  Okay.
[00:40:53.664 --> 00:40:55.406]  Alright, well, you would know this person.
[00:40:55.646 --> 00:41:03.833]  But anyway, um, oh, unfortunately, Alex, I developed, uh, epilepsy.
[00:41:05.339 --> 00:41:08.301]  And, uh, I'm witnessing it for a fact.
[00:41:08.942 --> 00:41:14.226]  How they only deal out so much of my disability benefit every week.
[00:41:15.647 --> 00:41:16.408]  They give me pills.
[00:41:16.428 --> 00:41:19.690]  I'm happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy.
[00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:20.891]  I'm so happy!
[00:41:21.271 --> 00:41:21.551]  Right?
[00:41:22.172 --> 00:41:23.393]  And make you sleep at night.
[00:41:25.815 --> 00:41:28.617]  And, oh, you can't have this and you can't have that.
[00:41:29.389 --> 00:41:31.770]  Well, sir, there's other treatments for epilepsy.
[00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:32.950]  I'm not going to tell you what to do.
[00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:35.291]  But you might check alternative treatments.
[00:41:35.311 --> 00:41:38.232]  You might eat a diet heavy in certain types of oils.
[00:41:38.672 --> 00:41:40.092]  You might watch what you're eating.
[00:41:40.812 --> 00:41:42.293]  It's, you know, a lot of different things.
[00:41:42.853 --> 00:41:43.373]  Okay.
[00:41:44.254 --> 00:41:44.614]  Okay.
[00:41:45.154 --> 00:41:49.095]  The brain is mainly cholesterol and water.
[00:41:49.835 --> 00:41:56.597]  And if you're not getting the right type of oils, your brain will actually not have a proper balance.
[00:41:57.097 --> 00:41:58.858]  And usually it's the most simple things.
[00:42:00.131 --> 00:42:01.012]  Oh, okay.
[00:42:01.652 --> 00:42:02.853]  That's the first I've heard this.
[00:42:02.953 --> 00:42:03.494]  Thank you.
[00:42:04.415 --> 00:42:07.997]  Alright Emmett, thanks for the call, and I'm sorry to hear that you've developed epilepsy.
[00:42:08.478 --> 00:42:09.058]  Take care.
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:13.682]  And you know, I don't censor really anything on my broadcast.
[00:42:13.702 --> 00:42:14.623]  We don't screen your calls.
[00:42:14.763 --> 00:42:24.410]  And I just, listen, if you hear all the other so-called Patriot Shows, mainly all they do is fight with each other and talk about how they're the best and they, you know, the other person's whatever.
[00:42:24.771 --> 00:42:26.192]  We don't do that here, okay?
[00:42:26.212 --> 00:42:27.653]  It's about the New World Order.
[00:42:28.422 --> 00:42:30.364]  It's about getting people to wake up.
[00:42:30.504 --> 00:42:33.706]  It is not about what somebody says about somebody else.
[00:42:34.147 --> 00:42:35.908]  Let's talk to Kirk in Colorado.
[00:42:36.549 --> 00:42:37.349]  Kirk, go ahead.
[00:42:37.369 --> 00:42:38.891]  Hi Alex, it's great to talk to you.
[00:42:38.911 --> 00:42:39.591]  Good luck to you.
[00:42:39.891 --> 00:42:41.553]  So much for the pursuit of happiness, eh?
[00:42:42.033 --> 00:42:42.313]  Yeah.
[00:42:42.794 --> 00:42:44.655]  You know, but I thought of a great example.
[00:42:44.695 --> 00:42:55.324]  I remember a while back they had that little girl that won that spelling bee that was so euphoric and was so happy and then they just threw a fit and said she wouldn't act that way because she was homeschooled, she wasn't
[00:42:55.751 --> 00:42:58.534]  Brain damaged enough by Ritalin in order to be able to control herself.
[00:42:58.574 --> 00:42:58.855]  Remember that?
[00:42:58.875 --> 00:42:59.275]  I remember that!
[00:42:59.295 --> 00:43:02.278]  They freaked out because she got so excited and euphoric.
[00:43:02.418 --> 00:43:10.908]  I was so happy for her and I'm like, oh, oh boy, you know, and then you see in the news that what bothered him is she wasn't brain damaged enough to be, to be, to know how to act like a drone.
[00:43:11.228 --> 00:43:14.872]  Well, Aldous Huxley, again, his brother ran UNESCO for the UN.
[00:43:15.493 --> 00:43:17.195]  He said in Brave New World, he said,
[00:43:17.901 --> 00:43:22.602]  You know, in 1962, decades after it was published, and I have the tape.
[00:43:22.662 --> 00:43:25.423]  In fact, it's posted on the website, the audio of it, at Berkeley.
[00:43:25.443 --> 00:43:30.904]  He said, look, I've been to the universities, I've been in government, my family's in government, this is the plan.
[00:43:30.964 --> 00:43:37.505]  They want to give you drugs or injections to brain damage you at birth to then dumb you down.
[00:43:38.425 --> 00:43:42.826]  They don't count on the schools doing it now, and now these new injections are going to do just that.
[00:43:43.462 --> 00:43:48.471]  Well, that was the whole reason for Ridland and Adder was to calm people down and, you know, and Prozac.
[00:43:48.892 --> 00:43:53.861]  I mean, it's just not happening fast enough where a virus can replicate itself and they can cause a lot of problems.
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:05.125]  Experts at Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, California have developed a super virus which produces proteins that can block or reduce the effects of cocaine.
[00:44:05.545 --> 00:44:09.828]  But you know, my son... And they give you the virus and it goes in and burns out the receptors in your brain.
[00:44:10.128 --> 00:44:11.128]  Oh, that's wonderful!
[00:44:11.689 --> 00:44:13.090]  A chemical lobotomy.
[00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:14.771]  No, a biological lobotomy.
[00:44:14.811 --> 00:44:15.171]  Go ahead.
[00:44:15.551 --> 00:44:21.094]  My son and I went to a pro-gun rally, and just because we were standing in the grass without a permit, I mean, we weren't saying anything.
[00:44:21.114 --> 00:44:23.836]  We were just listening to what these Nazis had to say.
[00:44:24.451 --> 00:44:26.892]  They were going to nightstick us for not stepping out of the grass.
[00:44:26.932 --> 00:44:28.513]  I'm like, that would brain damage you too, right?
[00:44:28.533 --> 00:44:29.753]  Getting hit in the head with a nightstick?
[00:44:29.793 --> 00:44:30.934]  You went to what type of rally?
[00:44:31.314 --> 00:44:37.157]  It was that May-Kami-Mami march up here in Denver where they were trying to, uh... So you had a couple bureaucrats there?
[00:44:37.177 --> 00:44:37.957]  Oh, pfft.
[00:44:38.417 --> 00:44:39.478]  There was cops everywhere.
[00:44:39.538 --> 00:44:42.039]  I mean, you know... Not I mean, I mean the million moms.
[00:44:42.059 --> 00:44:43.420]  What was it, like 200 bureaucrats?
[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:48.442]  Oh, the first rally there was quite a few, but I was shouting at them as they were getting on the bus.
[00:44:48.462 --> 00:44:49.743]  I'm like, you know... Well, you know, we have video.
[00:44:49.783 --> 00:44:52.564]  I remember putting a film that we should put in a film
[00:44:53.995 --> 00:45:05.403]  Of the 100 bureaucrat march here two years ago, three years ago in Austin, and the police tried arresting people for protesting protests in the past, but people sued them and won, so they backed off in Texas.
[00:45:05.643 --> 00:45:13.068]  But yeah, all over the country, oh, you don't have a permit, so you can't counter-demonstrate, and so the police ran over, and what'd they say to you?
[00:45:13.809 --> 00:45:20.213]  Well, they just told us we couldn't be down there without a permit, and I said, that person over there, that's anti-gun, doesn't have a permit, how come you're not rousting him?
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:23.661]  And of course, another cop come running over because I didn't immediately obey.
[00:45:24.181 --> 00:45:27.761]  And so they said, you can't stand on the city street without a permit.
[00:45:28.641 --> 00:45:30.242]  Neither the street nor the grass.
[00:45:30.322 --> 00:45:39.923]  It was downtown at the Capitol building and you couldn't be down there except on the sidewalk away from the people talking without a permit.
[00:45:39.943 --> 00:45:41.044]  Well, that's the new freedom!
[00:45:41.144 --> 00:45:42.104]  They didn't have a permit.
[00:45:42.144 --> 00:45:43.824]  And of course, you never had to have permits before.
[00:45:43.864 --> 00:45:45.264]  They turn a right into a privilege.
[00:45:45.564 --> 00:45:46.425]  Oh, that's ridiculous.
[00:45:46.465 --> 00:45:48.865]  I mean, but I do have some advice for you.
[00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:56.834]  This country has really gotten to be very racist against Muslims and very racist against, you know, those innocent people over there.
[00:45:57.354 --> 00:46:03.818]  And if you suggest that we shouldn't be over there killing them, they're going to turn you off because they won't even let me call into the radio station anymore.
[00:46:03.858 --> 00:46:09.000]  When I came out against the war because there was no justification for it, I said it was murder.
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:12.702]  And, you know, with no justification, that was it.
[00:46:13.163 --> 00:46:14.883]  What affiliate are you listening to us on?
[00:46:15.324 --> 00:46:15.784]  AFN.
[00:46:17.029 --> 00:46:19.530]  And that's American Freedom Network.
[00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:21.711]  I mean, what station number?
[00:46:22.552 --> 00:46:23.332]  Oh, 1360.
[00:46:24.273 --> 00:46:33.117]  Well, they're great folks, and they have some shows that may disagree with me on some issues, and they have others that don't, and so you're probably getting confused with certain shows.
[00:46:33.637 --> 00:46:35.999]  No, no, the station manager was Don Wiedemann.
[00:46:36.019 --> 00:46:38.440]  He said I couldn't call him anymore because I wasn't pro.
[00:46:39.096 --> 00:46:40.816]  Pro-killing Muslims and stuff.
[00:46:41.337 --> 00:46:42.357]  Oh, he didn't say that.
[00:46:42.437 --> 00:46:47.158]  He said I had to support the troops over there, otherwise I could not speak on the radio station.
[00:46:47.178 --> 00:46:48.918]  Well, they let me on.
[00:46:50.059 --> 00:46:51.299]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:46:51.499 --> 00:46:55.820]  You know, again, that's a couple calls, and I'm not mad at your caller, but that's a couple calls in a row.
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:58.241]  See, this person says this, that person says this.
[00:46:59.401 --> 00:47:00.741]  I support our troops.
[00:47:02.322 --> 00:47:04.622]  I do not support them breathing depleted uranium.
[00:47:04.742 --> 00:47:08.563]  We've had the guy who wrote the book for the military, Dr. Rocky, on to say it's happening.
[00:47:09.418 --> 00:47:13.620]  I do not support the Muslim extremists, because they're controlled by the globalists.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:16.401]  And they also manipulate the other countries.
[00:47:17.101 --> 00:47:20.202]  I don't think that Russia is the heart of evil.
[00:47:20.322 --> 00:47:21.683]  I don't think Israel is the heart of evil.
[00:47:22.083 --> 00:47:23.563]  I don't think America is the heart of evil.
[00:47:23.623 --> 00:47:27.985]  It's evil people controlling almost all the major groups that are doing this.
[00:47:28.985 --> 00:47:38.009]  And I've never been censored, and I think that it's a great radio station, great radio network, and I'm glad to be on their station for a long time now.
[00:47:39.276 --> 00:47:53.342]  They've been picking my show up off and on, I think for a couple years now, but again, it's about the New World Order, folks, and I will never, you know, gauge or control what I do here.
[00:47:53.402 --> 00:47:58.844]  No one's ever attempted to do that with the network I originate from, the GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:59.004 --> 00:48:03.266]  They never tell me what to say or do, but who knows?
[00:48:05.032 --> 00:48:07.753]  I don't want to turn this into a big argument.
[00:48:07.793 --> 00:48:11.794]  If somebody wants to call in and counter what you said, they're certainly welcome to do that.
[00:48:12.435 --> 00:48:15.496]  But I'd have to talk to them, because I don't know if that's the case.
[00:48:15.816 --> 00:48:19.737]  But again, folks, the New World Order is what we're dealing with here.
[00:48:20.537 --> 00:48:24.779]  Let's go ahead and go to LG in California.
[00:48:24.959 --> 00:48:26.019]  LG, you're on the air.
[00:48:26.079 --> 00:48:26.400]  Welcome.
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:27.200]  Hey, Alex.
[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:27.560]  Thanks.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:28.740]  Good to talk to you.
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:29.721]  Yeah, you too.
[00:48:30.201 --> 00:48:31.981]  Anyway, I just want to talk about a couple of things.
[00:48:33.891 --> 00:48:44.821]  People need to be woken up to the rhetoric that goes on with the categorization of right and left, the right-left paradigm as you call it.
[00:48:46.603 --> 00:48:55.532]  I think that's one thing that you need to throw in the face of people who start spewing rhetoric that don't know what they're talking about, because it just divides all of us.
[00:48:56.472 --> 00:48:58.955]  Yeah, I mean, George Bush, John Kerry,
[00:48:59.993 --> 00:49:03.276]  Are in the same bed together, literally, skull and bones.
[00:49:04.297 --> 00:49:07.940]  They're cousins, they're both totally for the war, they're both for gun control.
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:10.542]  It's a one party system.
[00:49:11.263 --> 00:49:12.624]  It is, it's a one party system.
[00:49:13.905 --> 00:49:23.093]  And the other thing I wanted to say is that all you have to do is look around you to realize that all the stuff that you're talking about is true.
[00:49:23.834 --> 00:49:27.537]  Police state, all you have to do is look and see some of the pictures of Boston.
[00:49:28.308 --> 00:49:38.813]  If you're a gun owner, like I am, you go on the internet and you look at, you know, gun products and things like that, and you just realize there's a huge police-industrial complex.
[00:49:39.933 --> 00:49:56.501]  And the other thing, too, is that if you've ever seen chemtrails, you realize that, you know, all these things are possible, and as far as the drug thing goes, I mean, I think that it would be extremely easy for them to distribute all the drugs that you're talking about through chemtrails, and people wouldn't even know it hit them.
[00:49:57.208 --> 00:50:01.432]  Oh, the government's done thousands of admitted tests of spraying the population.
[00:50:01.472 --> 00:50:02.593]  That's what I was talking about earlier.
[00:50:02.934 --> 00:50:05.556]  And they test on their own police, their own military.
[00:50:05.576 --> 00:50:06.998]  They kill them in some cases.
[00:50:07.738 --> 00:50:09.280]  And all we go off is the facts.
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:10.581]  It's the globalists, folks.
[00:50:10.641 --> 00:50:11.382]  I appreciate the call.
[00:50:11.782 --> 00:50:12.703]  It's the globalists.
[00:50:12.743 --> 00:50:14.064]  It's the New World Order.
[00:50:15.406 --> 00:50:19.490]  You know, people want to say it's the Catholics, it's the Jews, it's the Queen of England.
[00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:20.431]  No, folks.
[00:50:20.491 --> 00:50:21.672]  It's evil people.
[00:50:22.799 --> 00:50:29.901]  It's evil people in control of almost every major organization and institution, and they manipulate us.
[00:50:31.001 --> 00:50:38.403]  You know, the Bin Ladens, the radical Muslim groups, in almost every case we track them back to intelligence agencies.
[00:50:39.223 --> 00:50:40.663]  MI6, CIA.
[00:50:41.804 --> 00:50:43.184]  And you ask, why would that happen?
[00:50:43.224 --> 00:50:48.145]  Because by radicalizing the Muslims, that gives the globalists the pretext to go in and take them over.
[00:50:48.905 --> 00:50:51.706]  And meanwhile, our sons and daughters die in that fight
[00:50:52.802 --> 00:50:59.005]  There's another way, that's my point, there's another way and that's getting out of this new world order and learning the facts.
[00:50:59.366 --> 00:51:01.667]  We'll come back, take more calls, get to more news, stay with us.
[00:51:02.347 --> 00:51:05.249]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[00:51:05.956 --> 00:51:07.236]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:51:07.457 --> 00:51:13.179]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:51:13.459 --> 00:51:18.720]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:51:19.001 --> 00:51:23.122]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:51:23.322 --> 00:51:27.107]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:51:27.367 --> 00:51:32.013]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:51:32.093 --> 00:51:38.361]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.421 --> 00:51:40.244]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:51:40.704 --> 00:51:42.806]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.

[00:51:56.756 --> 00:51:58.277]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:51:58.457 --> 00:52:00.539]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:04.944]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:52:05.265 --> 00:52:14.097]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:14.417 --> 00:52:19.104]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:19.544 --> 00:52:26.271]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:26.671 --> 00:52:38.483]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:38.923 --> 00:52:43.388]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:52:43.568 --> 00:52:46.031]  Get the Murky Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:52:49.174 --> 00:52:50.636]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:52:50.656 --> 00:52:51.697]  Now get available in Iowa.
[00:53:02.321 --> 00:53:08.224]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:08.464 --> 00:53:10.725]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:10.906 --> 00:53:17.269]  We provide outstanding products like ECAC, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:18.250]  We're good to go!
[00:53:47.128 --> 00:53:50.209]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.389 --> 00:53:56.350]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:04.151 --> 00:54:10.192]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:10.792 --> 00:54:13.713]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:17.725 --> 00:54:19.405]  Look, here's the bottom line, folks.
[00:54:20.266 --> 00:54:22.666]  They're going to forcibly inoculate you with vaccines.
[00:54:22.686 --> 00:54:25.827]  They're going to track and satellite trace you and tax you to drive your car.
[00:54:25.847 --> 00:54:31.348]  They're going to turn your cities into armored compounds that you have to enter and exit through checkpoints to get into.
[00:54:32.508 --> 00:54:34.769]  They are going to take away more and more parental rights.
[00:54:34.829 --> 00:54:39.630]  They are going to have a national draft and make us invade dozens of other countries.
[00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:43.010]  They're going to do all these horrible things.
[00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:46.151]  And they're going to do it while John Kerry's in office or George Bush is in office.
[00:54:48.217 --> 00:54:51.758]  And so we better get past all this phony left-right discussion.
[00:54:53.699 --> 00:55:00.101]  You know, they have somebody like Michael Moore come out and make a film about 9-11 and basically whitewash it and act like the Democrats are going to save us.
[00:55:01.501 --> 00:55:05.283]  And a film like that overall does a disservice because it doesn't tell you the big story.
[00:55:06.083 --> 00:55:11.885]  My film, 9-11 and the Road to Tyranny, starts with Nero burning Rome to blame it on the Christians.
[00:55:13.645 --> 00:55:14.726]  It moves into Hitler.
[00:55:16.019 --> 00:55:18.361]  Blowing up the Reichstag to blame it on his enemies.
[00:55:19.561 --> 00:55:22.463]  It gets into the sinking of the main, which the government carried out.
[00:55:23.464 --> 00:55:25.826]  It gets into Pearl Harbor.
[00:55:25.846 --> 00:55:29.768]  It gets into Operation Northwood, the official government plan to carry out 9-11 style attacks.
[00:55:31.409 --> 00:55:33.671]  It gets into Kennedy being killed.
[00:55:34.191 --> 00:55:39.375]  Then it moves into the first World Trade Center bombing, where the government took the bomb and trained the driver.
[00:55:39.415 --> 00:55:39.935]  That's admitted.
[00:55:40.355 --> 00:55:43.618]  Then Oklahoma City, with the Bill Clinton carry out, the 9-11.
[00:55:45.811 --> 00:55:48.032]  And so, you could say it's bipartisan.
[00:55:48.472 --> 00:55:59.915]  It exposes that they're all puppets, but people get fooled by this and fall into this tribalism of, well, you know, our troops are dying, they're getting killed, they're over there fighting, you know, Saddam's people.
[00:56:02.595 --> 00:56:04.876]  The problem is our government carried out policies
[00:56:07.506 --> 00:56:11.348]  That admittedly were meant to get the Iraqis to fight.
[00:56:11.828 --> 00:56:13.449]  Because they want the war to go on and on.
[00:56:13.509 --> 00:56:15.110]  Vietnam was meant to go on and on.
[00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:16.851]  The war is against the people.
[00:56:17.171 --> 00:56:18.391]  It's about a police state.
[00:56:18.672 --> 00:56:21.013]  And they don't care how many of us die in that process.
[00:56:22.453 --> 00:56:24.114]  It's perpetual war, folks.
[00:56:24.214 --> 00:56:25.075]  War is peace.
[00:56:26.275 --> 00:56:27.476]  Freedom is slavery.
[00:56:28.216 --> 00:56:29.217]  Ignorance is strength.
[00:56:30.577 --> 00:56:33.899]  And so if we don't expand our minds, the big picture,
[00:56:36.059 --> 00:56:37.780]  I mean, look, John Kerry's supposedly bad.
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:39.400]  John Kerry thinks this war is great.
[00:56:41.481 --> 00:56:48.704]  So, yes, I do support the troops, but I do not support them coming back here to be police who've been trained that there's no freedom.
[00:56:49.464 --> 00:56:57.347]  I do not support the gun confiscation going on up in Wisconsin, with their little excuses for that.
[00:56:57.608 --> 00:56:59.208]  We're going to talk about that coming up in a few minutes.
[00:57:00.129 --> 00:57:01.009]  I do not support
[00:57:02.242 --> 00:57:07.046]  Just the out-of-control taxation and regulation, regardless of what party's in office.
[00:57:09.629 --> 00:57:11.270]  We're in trouble, America.
[00:57:11.591 --> 00:57:15.094]  We're in trouble worldwide, on a global level.
[00:57:16.375 --> 00:57:20.019]  Because elites, whether that was the Chinese a thousand years ago,
[00:57:21.456 --> 00:57:23.677]  Or King Herod and the Romans.
[00:57:24.478 --> 00:57:26.419]  Or whether it was the British Crown in 1776.
[00:57:26.639 --> 00:57:30.020]  Elites enjoy exercising power.
[00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:31.481]  They want to control you.
[00:57:31.741 --> 00:57:34.642]  Their business is serfdom, enslavement, control.
[00:57:35.003 --> 00:57:35.963]  That's what they're into.
[00:57:36.183 --> 00:57:37.364]  That's what they're experts at.
[00:57:37.504 --> 00:57:38.904]  And we better wake up to that.
[00:57:40.645 --> 00:57:44.567]  And say, I don't care what label you put on it, you're not taking my Second or Fourth Amendment.
[00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:48.552]  And you're not going to co-op me with phony left-wing or right-wing garbage.
[00:57:48.832 --> 00:57:50.674]  We're able to deprogram Democrats.
[00:57:51.074 --> 00:57:56.157]  Whereas a phony right-wing neocon can't do it because the Democrats sees what a hypocrite they are.
[00:57:56.337 --> 00:58:11.968]  But I'm able to deprogram Democrats and conservatives because I talk from a common-sense position, a factual position, not the fake paradigm, the fake reality that's projected out into our political spectrum.

[00:58:42.265 --> 00:58:43.326]  The tyranny is upon you.
[00:58:43.806 --> 00:58:45.347]  It has nothing to do with fighting terror.
[00:58:45.627 --> 00:58:46.788]  It's about enslaving you.
[00:58:46.808 --> 00:58:48.849]  The war is against you and your family.
[00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:50.290]  We'll be back with the second hour.
[00:58:57.915 --> 00:58:58.595]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.236 --> 00:59:00.317]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.997 --> 00:59:02.158]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.758 --> 00:59:03.599]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.339 --> 00:59:05.140]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.271 --> 00:59:09.532]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.072 --> 00:59:14.193]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.533 --> 00:59:21.554]  They've got mass gun confiscation door-to-door going on up in Wisconsin.
[00:59:21.574 --> 00:59:22.835]  This has happened before.
[00:59:24.195 --> 00:59:25.695]  We've got a guest coming up to cover that.
[00:59:26.215 --> 00:59:32.897]  We'll talk about the latest police state developments up at the Democratic National Theater.
[00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:38.493]  And just much, much, much more and your phone calls, so stay with us.
[00:59:39.253 --> 00:59:42.135]  In fact, let's go to some phone calls right now, my friends.
[00:59:43.255 --> 00:59:49.339]  Let's go ahead and talk to Roberta in Colorado.
[00:59:49.479 --> 00:59:50.280]  Go ahead, Roberta.
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:51.080]  Morning, Alex.
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:51.720]  Welcome.
[00:59:52.161 --> 00:59:54.442]  Hey, I just want to make a comment and then I'll hang up.
[00:59:56.283 --> 00:59:59.325]  Regarding these vaccines for our neurotransmitters,
[01:00:00.618 --> 01:00:13.434]  What's going to happen to the cash cow of the cocaine business, the opium business, the tobacco business, if we're all, you know, immune to this all of a sudden with these nice vaccines they're coming up with?
[01:00:14.074 --> 01:00:18.540]  Well, then they have drugs that affect other receptors and those are going to be rolled out.
[01:00:19.859 --> 01:00:23.382]  And plus, the globalists are having too much trouble monopolizing the narcotics.
[01:00:23.942 --> 01:00:27.285]  For those that just joined us, the British and U.S.
[01:00:27.345 --> 01:00:42.399]  government, the British government's about to make their people take it, an anti-narcotic plus nicotine vaccine, where a virus deposits proteins in the nerve-ending receptors, mmm, plaques in the brain, so you cannot have euphoria.
[01:00:42.978 --> 01:00:50.141]  Because, again, that's what narcotics mimic, is the natural endorphins or drugs your body gives you when you do a good job doing something.
[01:00:51.522 --> 01:00:57.704]  So, openly they're talking about this, and they're saying they're going to make people start taking this.
[01:00:58.124 --> 01:01:01.706]  This is why this is such a massive story, and I'm glad you called in about it.
[01:01:01.946 --> 01:01:02.246]  Alright.
[01:01:02.566 --> 01:01:03.127]  Anything else?
[01:01:03.507 --> 01:01:03.927]  No, that's it.
[01:01:04.745 --> 01:01:05.005]  Thank you.
[01:01:05.205 --> 01:01:05.605]  You bet.
[01:01:05.665 --> 01:01:08.526]  Good to hear from you there in Colorado.
[01:01:08.566 --> 01:01:11.066]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michael in Texas.
[01:01:11.106 --> 01:01:11.786]  Go ahead, Michael.
[01:01:11.866 --> 01:01:14.707]  Yeah, I've got a few interesting points to make with you.
[01:01:16.807 --> 01:01:22.528]  Have you ever seen the movie Equilibrium, which came out in the winter of 2002 with Christian Bale?
[01:01:22.568 --> 01:01:24.289]  It's about a post-World War III world.
[01:01:24.809 --> 01:01:25.409]  No, I haven't.
[01:01:25.969 --> 01:01:29.550]  I would suggest that you and your listeners rent that movie.
[01:01:29.590 --> 01:01:31.250]  It's about a post-World War III
[01:01:32.613 --> 01:01:38.692]  uh... police state where everyone is on uh... emotion uh... prohibiting drugs
[01:01:40.413 --> 01:01:48.180]  Well, that's what the government, I mean, I'd say three, four years ago, I've heard a scene where they said, oh, we'll give you a vaccine where you're not ever able to get angry again.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:52.483]  Oh, we're going to give you a vaccine that sterilizes you sexually where you don't want to.
[01:01:52.864 --> 01:01:55.086]  Oh, we're going to give you a vaccine so you don't want to use drugs.
[01:01:55.146 --> 01:01:56.407]  It's total mind control.
[01:01:56.447 --> 01:01:56.827]  Go ahead.
[01:01:57.208 --> 01:02:03.093]  This movie here, it's like 1984 to the 10th power, and it also shows the resistance in there.
[01:02:03.753 --> 01:02:06.556]  The other couple of interesting things too I'd like to make out is,
[01:02:08.376 --> 01:02:10.397]  You're talking about Freemasonry being hijacked?
[01:02:10.957 --> 01:02:20.983]  Well, from my beliefs and perspectives, what I've seen has been bad from the beginning, just like the teachings of the Catholic Church.
[01:02:21.163 --> 01:02:32.329]  I mean, you know, explain to me how in D.C., in the city, you got the pentagram as well as the compass there, which was approved, I believe, by Jefferson or Washington.
[01:02:33.248 --> 01:02:39.329]  Well, what I said is, I didn't say that it was once good and got hijacked, I said it got even worse.
[01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:59.314]  And no matter what institution it is, the Catholic Church, the Protestant Church in America is telling you microchips are good, forced abortion is okay in China, a lot of the Jewish organizations, I mean almost everything, that's what the globalists do, they infiltrate everything.
[01:03:00.229 --> 01:03:05.472]  And so, what I said is that I had grandfathers, great grandfathers who were masons.
[01:03:05.892 --> 01:03:07.013]  They weren't bad people.
[01:03:07.033 --> 01:03:10.895]  They were what you'd call, some of them weren't porch masons, but most of them were porch masons.
[01:03:11.336 --> 01:03:15.998]  That's outer masons in a compartmentalized structure that didn't know what the higher levels are.
[01:03:16.098 --> 01:03:24.083]  So, I get on the air and say, the masons are all devil worshippers, and a bunch of masons didn't think I'm a liar, because they never made it into the higher levels.
[01:03:24.938 --> 01:03:28.001]  And a lot of our founding fathers were mazes, and this confuses people.
[01:03:28.021 --> 01:03:29.502]  They go, oh, the founders must have been bad.
[01:03:30.143 --> 01:03:34.647]  No, they didn't know the full picture, and many of them wrote and talked about this.
[01:03:34.707 --> 01:03:38.470]  So, again, it's like you have evil people in the Chinese government.
[01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:40.312]  It doesn't mean the Chinese people are evil.
[01:03:41.673 --> 01:03:42.534]  It's evil systems.
[01:03:42.574 --> 01:03:42.914]  Go ahead.
[01:03:43.375 --> 01:03:47.999]  Well, I would just, if you could later today, I would go rent that movie Equilibrium.
[01:03:48.039 --> 01:03:49.360]  Okay, thanks a lot for the call.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:49.881]  I appreciate it.
[01:03:49.901 --> 01:03:50.261]  We'll be back.
[01:03:55.859 --> 01:04:01.344]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:04:01.765 --> 01:04:06.009]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:04:06.229 --> 01:04:13.276]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:04:13.656 --> 01:04:19.762]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:04:19.902 --> 01:04:21.123]  There are no side effects.
[01:04:21.443 --> 01:04:24.404]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:04:24.544 --> 01:04:26.585]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:04:26.885 --> 01:04:34.128]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:04:34.408 --> 01:04:37.789]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:04:38.229 --> 01:04:46.497]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[01:04:46.517 --> 01:04:47.678]  866-885-6625.
[01:04:47.698 --> 01:04:48.038]  866-885-6625.
[01:04:48.299 --> 01:04:50.501]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:04:51.922 --> 01:04:52.543]  Call today.
[01:04:53.163 --> 01:04:57.507]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:04:57.668 --> 01:05:02.032]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:05:05.050 --> 01:05:06.536]  A new world order.
[01:05:08.746 --> 01:05:09.567]  Panama!
[01:05:09.787 --> 01:05:14.010]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:05:14.070 --> 01:05:20.995]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:05:21.115 --> 01:05:23.216]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:05:23.497 --> 01:05:33.844]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:05:34.144 --> 01:05:36.846]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new
[01:05:36.966 --> 01:05:38.207]  This is a two and a half hour video.
[01:05:38.247 --> 01:05:39.488]  Police State 3 is for you!
[01:05:39.988 --> 01:05:42.630]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:43.211]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:05:43.251 --> 01:05:43.771]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:05:43.791 --> 01:05:45.072]  Order today and spread the word!
[01:05:52.578 --> 01:05:55.860]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:00.102]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:06:00.342 --> 01:06:03.123]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:06:03.323 --> 01:06:05.725]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:06:05.925 --> 01:06:14.569]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:06:14.749 --> 01:06:16.110]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:20.452]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:06:20.772 --> 01:06:21.313]  We're good to go!
[01:06:58.036 --> 01:06:58.697]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.337 --> 01:07:00.438]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.118 --> 01:07:02.299]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.879 --> 01:07:03.720]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:06.381]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.401 --> 01:07:09.683]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.203 --> 01:07:14.286]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:17.837 --> 01:07:18.758]  All right, my friends.
[01:07:18.818 --> 01:07:23.340]  We're 8 minutes and 30 seconds into the second hour.
[01:07:24.701 --> 01:07:26.782]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:28.243]  until 2 p.m.
[01:07:28.684 --> 01:07:30.164]  Central Standard Time.
[01:07:31.245 --> 01:07:38.089]  From Florida to Texas to Colorado to California to Washington State to New York, we're on the AM and FM dial.
[01:07:39.210 --> 01:07:41.091]  Simulcasting on Global Shortwave.
[01:07:42.907 --> 01:07:48.809]  During the day from 11 to 2 at 9475 and back from 9 to midnight central at 3210.
[01:07:50.209 --> 01:07:58.911]  And always you can obviously listen via the internet at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com as well as PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:00.572 --> 01:08:03.353]  Alright, there is so much that I want to cover here.
[01:08:04.813 --> 01:08:07.174]  We're about to go to a guest concerning gun confiscation.
[01:08:07.214 --> 01:08:08.074]  Before we do that,
[01:08:09.008 --> 01:08:10.028]  I've made ten films.
[01:08:10.088 --> 01:08:17.130]  I carry a bunch of other great videos concerning globalism, the control, the Democratic and Republican parties, the fake left-right paradigm.
[01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:22.591]  And one of the best films I've got is Police State 3 Total Enslavement, my third of the films.
[01:08:23.132 --> 01:08:25.072]  It's two hours, forty-four minutes long.
[01:08:25.992 --> 01:08:28.833]  It's really the equivalent of three or four films in one.
[01:08:29.545 --> 01:08:40.471]  We cover who the neocons are, what the New World Order is, how they control the left and right, the Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security, the gun confiscation plans, RFID, foreign troops.
[01:08:41.091 --> 01:08:46.134]  It's all in your face, all mainstream news, telling you how great all this stuff is.
[01:08:46.214 --> 01:08:47.495]  This is not conspiracy theory.
[01:08:47.835 --> 01:08:50.437]  We take all their stuff and show you what they're doing.
[01:08:51.217 --> 01:08:52.798]  The implantable microchips, all of it.
[01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:57.432]  That's one of my films.
[01:08:57.452 --> 01:08:57.432]  $25.95.
[01:08:57.532 --> 01:08:59.553]  Get three or more of any of the ten films I've made.
[01:08:59.573 --> 01:09:04.837]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, America Destroyed by Design.
[01:09:04.877 --> 01:09:06.519]  They drop down to $20 a piece.
[01:09:06.539 --> 01:09:07.319]  That's a big discount.
[01:09:07.859 --> 01:09:11.482]  Also, I carry a bunch of other videos by Torch Humphrey and Eric Huffschmid about 9-11.
[01:09:12.523 --> 01:09:13.944]  So much information you need.
[01:09:14.696 --> 01:09:16.197]  Toll-free number to order the films.
[01:09:16.217 --> 01:09:17.018]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:09:17.058 --> 01:09:17.378]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:09:17.398 --> 01:09:21.260]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:09:36.491 --> 01:09:37.432]  Take action, folks.
[01:09:37.492 --> 01:09:38.373]  Get my videos.
[01:09:38.413 --> 01:09:41.435]  Make copies of them for non-profit educational purposes.
[01:09:41.775 --> 01:09:43.056]  Air them on AXS television.
[01:09:43.457 --> 01:09:44.958]  Show them to your VFW hall.
[01:09:45.038 --> 01:09:49.021]  Show them, you know, at your church or synagogue or whatever.
[01:09:49.361 --> 01:09:51.803]  Just get the information out to people.
[01:09:51.903 --> 01:09:54.906]  It is so important that you do this.
[01:09:55.366 --> 01:09:59.069]  The tyranny is coming down on us right now, no matter who's in office.
[01:10:00.652 --> 01:10:04.155]  The state, county, federal, international level, we're coming into this thing.
[01:10:04.475 --> 01:10:05.636]  We've got to fight it.
[01:10:05.676 --> 01:10:09.259]  People are more inclined to listen than they've ever been.
[01:10:09.359 --> 01:10:11.140]  You've got to strike while the iron's hot.
[01:10:11.961 --> 01:10:13.522]  During this climax that's happening.
[01:10:14.022 --> 01:10:14.923]  So again, 1-888-253-3139.
[01:10:15.103 --> 01:10:15.584]  Okay.
[01:10:15.684 --> 01:10:23.790]  We're about to go to Corey Graff, Executive Director of Wisconsin Gun Owners Association.
[01:10:24.030 --> 01:10:25.812]  We'll tell you about their website and information.
[01:10:25.872 --> 01:10:27.353]  It's wisconsingunowners.org.
[01:10:30.909 --> 01:10:44.255]  And, folks, in Dallas, Texas, in Miami, Florida, in Phoenix, Arizona, just conservative states, liberal states, this is what happens.
[01:10:44.315 --> 01:10:44.975]  It's in the newspaper.
[01:10:47.216 --> 01:10:48.857]  Hello, your husband's not here, is he?
[01:10:48.917 --> 01:10:50.377]  Hi, I'm Officer Johnson.
[01:10:50.517 --> 01:10:52.738]  I'd like to come in and look at your firearms.
[01:10:52.758 --> 01:10:53.679]  This is a knock and talk.
[01:10:53.719 --> 01:10:55.459]  Make sure they're secured safely and everything's fine.
[01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:57.180]  Well, officer, do you have a warrant?
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.521]  Well, just, ma'am, what do you have to hide?
[01:10:58.561 --> 01:10:58.921]  Let me in.
[01:10:59.594 --> 01:11:00.315]  This is a courtesy.
[01:11:00.355 --> 01:11:01.817]  This is in middle class neighborhoods, folks.
[01:11:02.057 --> 01:11:06.222]  Bill Clinton's been doing this since the, you know, we're gonna have gun sweeps and things like that in the projects.
[01:11:06.663 --> 01:11:09.106]  Folks that don't know their rights, they do that first.
[01:11:09.366 --> 01:11:10.528]  That's how it always works.
[01:11:12.222 --> 01:11:13.263]  But now this is happening.
[01:11:13.403 --> 01:11:15.164]  And then I want to read part of this article.
[01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:17.646]  This is out of the New Orleans News Channel.
[01:11:18.186 --> 01:11:23.810]  Court opens door to search without warrants in a groundbreaking court decision that legal experts say will affect everyone.
[01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:29.694]  Police officers in Louisiana no longer need a search for arrest warrant to conduct a search of your home or business.
[01:11:31.135 --> 01:11:34.097]  And it says no crime need be committed or with no probable cause.
[01:11:34.137 --> 01:11:35.738]  We just get to do neighborhood sweeps.
[01:11:36.787 --> 01:11:41.788]  Leaders in law enforcement say it will keep officers safe, but others argue that it's a privilege that will be abused.
[01:11:41.828 --> 01:11:42.328]  A privilege?
[01:11:43.609 --> 01:11:44.709]  The Fourth Amendment, folks!
[01:11:45.589 --> 01:11:47.489]  And all over the country this is going on.
[01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:55.291]  And they've got other quotes here, where they break down exactly what this is going to do.
[01:11:57.052 --> 01:12:03.193]  And this is very, very, very, very, very serious.
[01:12:04.156 --> 01:12:05.577]  So, that's all that's happened here.
[01:12:05.737 --> 01:12:10.319]  A police officer got shot, not critically, not any gunshot wound is serious.
[01:12:10.899 --> 01:12:12.240]  And this happens all over the country now.
[01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:16.682]  And they cordoned off a whole neighborhood and started making everybody turn their guns in.
[01:12:17.242 --> 01:12:28.528]  Now, the cops never even found the bullet, but they're going to treat everybody as if they're guilty until proven innocent, grabbing their guns, and they won't let people see the warrant.
[01:12:28.548 --> 01:12:30.949]  They claim it was a blanket warrant for the whole neighborhood.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:35.101]  We've had this here in Austin in drug raids where no drugs are found.
[01:12:35.121 --> 01:12:35.901]  They get really angry.
[01:12:35.921 --> 01:12:36.981]  The U.S.
[01:12:37.121 --> 01:12:38.561]  Army's with them sometimes, by the way.
[01:12:39.201 --> 01:12:44.302]  And they go in there and they tear everything up and they don't... and they don't even have the bullet.
[01:12:45.402 --> 01:12:50.083]  So this is the new America, folks, where they come in and take your guns.
[01:12:51.704 --> 01:12:52.464]  It's just amazing.
[01:12:52.504 --> 01:12:59.345]  So we're joined by Corey Graff and his headline is, Oshkoff Police Conduct Door-to-Door Gun Compensations
[01:13:00.609 --> 01:13:05.238]  Shooting of Oshkosh police officer results in knee-jerk neighborhood gun grab.
[01:13:05.939 --> 01:13:13.693]  Following the shooting of an Oshkosh police officer Saturday night, area residents were forced from their homes, their lawful firearms being confiscated by police.
[01:13:14.835 --> 01:13:15.916]  How would you like that, police?
[01:13:15.936 --> 01:13:17.958]  Somebody shoots a cop and then they come take your gun.
[01:13:18.279 --> 01:13:26.987]  The Oshkosh Police Department Special Weapons and Tactics Unit responded to the area with canine police dog in pursuit of the perpetrator who was reported to a flood on foot.
[01:13:27.047 --> 01:13:30.170]  Citizens' guns were seized through the searches of area homes.
[01:13:30.210 --> 01:13:34.615]  The police promised to return the firearms after forensic tests prove they are not involved in the crime.
[01:13:36.115 --> 01:13:38.517]  The injured officer's name was withheld, but we now have that.
[01:13:38.997 --> 01:13:43.261]  The message is, hand over your guns now, said Corey Graff, Executive Director of Wisconsin Gun Owners.
[01:13:43.601 --> 01:13:49.706]  This is a blatant cause, a case of guilty until proven innocent, and an abuse of police power.
[01:13:51.668 --> 01:13:58.233]  Alright, uh, Mr. Graff, thanks for holding through that four minute diatribe, but tell us, tell us about what's happened.
[01:13:58.954 --> 01:14:05.079]  Well, essentially Alex, we have, just as you said, we have an entire neighborhood which has been presumed guilty
[01:14:06.257 --> 01:14:10.319]  The rule of law and the presumption of innocence has been chucked out the window.
[01:14:11.399 --> 01:14:14.541]  And, you know, as you said, it's a knee-jerk reaction.
[01:14:14.561 --> 01:14:20.463]  The police came in and it turned into essentially what I would describe as a military zone.
[01:14:21.183 --> 01:14:31.047]  You had the SWAT teams, you had, you know, police who, to what normal everyday people appear to be Darth Vader stormtroopers.
[01:14:31.107 --> 01:14:33.128]  I guess that's how a lot of people were describing them.
[01:14:33.957 --> 01:14:37.979]  And you had just, you know, regular everyday folks in an Oshkosh, Wisconsin neighborhood.
[01:14:38.279 --> 01:14:42.761]  And I gotta tell you, you know, Oshkosh, Wisconsin is just like any other neighborhood in America.
[01:14:42.841 --> 01:14:45.582]  It's a, it's a, a basic middle-class neighborhood.
[01:14:45.622 --> 01:14:48.263]  People are honest, they're law-abiding, they're hardworking.
[01:14:49.264 --> 01:14:54.926]  And we're, we're seriously, we, we, we feel very serious about this officer who got shot.
[01:14:55.547 --> 01:14:56.907]  Um, and we're very fortunate.
[01:14:56.947 --> 01:15:03.390]  We feel very glad that officer named Gallagher of the Oshkosh police force was not fatally hurt.
[01:15:03.897 --> 01:15:05.397]  And he is now back on the job.
[01:15:05.457 --> 01:15:11.799]  Well, I agree with you, but they haven't even found the bullet, but they're saying they're still going to test all the guns.
[01:15:14.359 --> 01:15:16.560]  Folks, this is such a dangerous precedent.
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:17.820]  They never did this before.
[01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:21.021]  We got along all these hundreds of years without stuff like this.
[01:15:21.701 --> 01:15:27.522]  Well, I have to ask the question, why confiscate the guns to do what they were calling ballistics tests?
[01:15:28.078 --> 01:15:31.199]  As you said, if there's no bullet, it absolutely defies law.
[01:15:31.219 --> 01:15:40.083]  Well, as if the guy who ran into whatever house isn't going to put it, you know, in the toilet or whatever, or, you know, wherever you hide stuff.
[01:15:40.163 --> 01:15:41.144]  I mean, it's a joke!
[01:15:42.064 --> 01:15:48.027]  This does tie in, too, with the United States Supreme Court rulings on what is known as exigent circumstance.
[01:15:49.242 --> 01:16:05.722]  Where you actually need or you know in the old day when we were free and we had actual liberty you actually the police actually had to have specific information they had to see the perpetrator run into a home they had to see him you know break a window and climb in there before they could pursue him.
[01:16:06.417 --> 01:16:10.698]  And what's happened now is... Well, they're already doing this with other crimes.
[01:16:11.438 --> 01:16:12.799]  Oh, somebody ran from the police.
[01:16:12.819 --> 01:16:14.559]  We're going to search the neighborhood in L.A.
[01:16:14.579 --> 01:16:16.100]  I mean, they've been doing this for a while.
[01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:17.540]  Yeah, this is nothing new.
[01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:21.061]  But, you know, I've got to tell you, in Wisconsin, we think of ourselves as real conservative.
[01:16:21.781 --> 01:16:28.703]  And, you know, you talk to any gun owner up here and, you know, they're not going to let anybody come into their home and take their guns.
[01:16:28.763 --> 01:16:29.363]  Well, guess what?
[01:16:29.383 --> 01:16:30.063]  They're letting them.
[01:16:30.463 --> 01:16:33.204]  They're sitting by while the police are heavy-handing them.
[01:16:34.257 --> 01:16:36.457]  How did the police behave while they were doing this?
[01:16:37.258 --> 01:16:49.200]  Well, I can just give you one quote from one resident who actually came home from work and he discovered that his whole apartment looked as though it had been broken into.
[01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:54.021]  He said that his personal blinds were strewn all over the floor and his gun safe was empty.
[01:16:54.661 --> 01:16:56.121]  So this is the new freedom?
[01:16:56.161 --> 01:17:00.622]  They dump your stuff everywhere, ransack, steal your guns, this is freedom?
[01:17:01.417 --> 01:17:03.118]  This is what this Oshkosh resident said.
[01:17:03.138 --> 01:17:04.900]  He said, quote, That makes me so mad.
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:07.762]  They had no reason to remove my firearms without a warrant.
[01:17:08.223 --> 01:17:11.805]  I didn't know they removed anything until my buddy who's staying with me noticed they were missing.
[01:17:12.266 --> 01:17:14.768]  I thought you had to have a warrant to take somebody's gun.
[01:17:14.788 --> 01:17:26.717]  Now, this is somebody who doesn't necessarily understand the Constitution, and he may not understand historical context, but he knows and has got a feeling that something isn't quite right here, and he feels extremely violated.
[01:17:27.038 --> 01:17:29.820]  And that was a common sentiment in the area that this was going on.
[01:17:30.962 --> 01:17:32.062]  Well, you know what?
[01:17:32.262 --> 01:17:36.484]  If they don't give all the guns back and apologize, you guys run that town.
[01:17:36.504 --> 01:17:39.945]  You need to fire that police chief and fire every one of the police involved.
[01:17:41.225 --> 01:17:43.986]  We gotta send a message that this is not going to be tolerated.
[01:17:45.986 --> 01:17:53.669]  Well, one thing, Alex, that ties in with this, and I think this is very important, is how the police themselves responded to this.
[01:17:53.729 --> 01:17:55.829]  Essentially, the message was this.
[01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:57.730]  Well, you know, we broke in
[01:17:58.471 --> 01:18:05.857]  And, um, you know, we didn't find what we were looking for, and, you know, we determined that you were innocent, but, you know, we're sorry.
[01:18:06.317 --> 01:18:06.978]  Have a nice day.
[01:18:07.598 --> 01:18:08.379]  Go about your life.
[01:18:08.419 --> 01:18:09.559]  This is when nothing happened.
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:20.928]  And, um, the captain of the Oshkosh police force, his name's Captain Jay Pustil, he was reported to have, according to an Oshkosh Northwestern newspaper, said,
[01:18:23.095 --> 01:18:28.620]  And, uh, has written that he declined to say on what grounds officers had the right to remove the firearm.
[01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:31.001]  The police are not accountable to the people.
[01:18:32.463 --> 01:18:37.026]  They're absolutely acting lawless, and what you have here is a situation.
[01:18:37.346 --> 01:18:40.909]  You have a real life police state in the state of Wisconsin.
[01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:42.430]  We're known as being conservative.
[01:18:42.891 --> 01:18:46.494]  Yeah, they've never done this before, and now they're doing it all over the place.
[01:18:46.934 --> 01:18:47.955]  It's becoming widespread.
[01:18:48.155 --> 01:18:48.615]  Stay with us.
[01:18:48.635 --> 01:18:49.396]  We'll be right back, sir.
[01:18:54.358 --> 01:18:57.360]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:06.524]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:19:06.845 --> 01:19:11.527]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:19:11.987 --> 01:19:18.709]  The Murky Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:19:19.109 --> 01:19:30.892]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[01:19:53.174 --> 01:19:55.915]  Do you know there's a price war in the insurance business?

[01:20:54.779 --> 01:20:56.541]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[01:20:57.041 --> 01:21:00.483]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[01:21:00.984 --> 01:21:01.664]  Let's update.
[01:21:02.164 --> 01:21:06.427]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[01:21:07.528 --> 01:21:09.910]  The Nasdaq, in that same time frame, is flat.
[01:21:10.658 --> 01:21:11.598]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[01:21:11.638 --> 01:21:13.959]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:15.380]  Today, the U.S.
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:17.621]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[01:21:18.041 --> 01:21:19.562]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[01:21:20.142 --> 01:21:22.123]  January of 2002, gold's spot was 283.
[01:21:23.463 --> 01:21:28.325]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[01:21:29.326 --> 01:21:30.066]  Gold is moving.
[01:21:30.326 --> 01:21:31.487]  Equities are treading water.
[01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:34.428]  There's very little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[01:21:35.071 --> 01:21:36.452]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:38.613]  Physical possession, private gold.
[01:21:39.013 --> 01:21:40.954]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[01:21:41.394 --> 01:21:43.515]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[01:21:45.676 --> 01:21:47.817]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.
[01:21:48.197 --> 01:21:48.497]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.624 --> 01:21:54.624]  It's finally here!
[01:21:54.745 --> 01:21:55.725]  Spring has arrived!
[01:21:55.925 --> 01:21:58.906]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:21:59.107 --> 01:22:02.568]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.

[01:23:04.415 --> 01:23:06.616]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[01:23:07.176 --> 01:23:12.097]  We're talking to Corey Graff, Executive Director of Wisconsin Gun Owners.
[01:23:13.217 --> 01:23:15.958]  Website's WisconsinGunOwners.org.
[01:23:17.138 --> 01:23:19.978]  I don't care what excuses you make driving around in your police cars.
[01:23:21.399 --> 01:23:24.139]  This didn't happen in the past because this was America.
[01:23:24.539 --> 01:23:31.561]  I know you think you're God, some of you, and how would you like having your guns confiscated or your whole neighborhood being guilty?
[01:23:32.498 --> 01:23:38.140]  This isn't how America works, and I'm not against the police, but I'm against this type of activity.
[01:23:40.401 --> 01:23:43.442]  Please continue, Corey, with what you were talking about.
[01:23:44.182 --> 01:23:50.185]  Well, you know, this situation, and we talk about gun owners, but this affects far more people than just gun owners.
[01:23:50.205 --> 01:23:59.348]  You have to understand that in this specific area, the entire neighborhood was literally forced from their homes and forced to go to a nearby shelter
[01:24:00.450 --> 01:24:10.215]  And while the police, who were dressed in what I would call quasi-military gear, the SWAT people were essentially going through their personal belongings.
[01:24:11.195 --> 01:24:21.781]  And in one situation that came out in the news media, and I was watching the news report with my wife, and we were absolutely horrified to see what we were seeing on the television.
[01:24:22.061 --> 01:24:23.081]  And this is what we saw.
[01:24:23.121 --> 01:24:29.945]  We saw an elderly woman, and she was not a gun owner, and she was not a criminal, and she was just a nice old lady,
[01:24:30.538 --> 01:24:37.844]  She was talking about how she woke up in the early morning hours to find police and military gear rummaging through her kitchen.
[01:24:38.585 --> 01:24:43.869]  Now, I have to ask, is Grandma taking pot shots out of her kitchen window?
[01:24:44.569 --> 01:24:46.091]  Does she have something to hide in the cookie jar?
[01:24:46.131 --> 01:24:46.951]  What's going on here?
[01:24:47.512 --> 01:24:55.798]  This is affecting law-abiding people, it's affecting senior citizens, and they don't understand the overall picture of what's going on.
[01:24:56.919 --> 01:25:00.122]  There's been a shift from being a free nation to a
[01:25:00.832 --> 01:25:02.214]  A tyrannical police state.
[01:25:02.674 --> 01:25:07.138]  Cory, listen, I'm begging you.
[01:25:07.498 --> 01:25:09.220]  Did you record this on the television?
[01:25:10.581 --> 01:25:11.782]  Unfortunately, I did not.
[01:25:12.603 --> 01:25:17.347]  I've got to tell you, the news reports and the news media have been anything but cooperative with us.
[01:25:17.587 --> 01:25:26.755]  Well, let me give you the background on that, and I'm begging somebody to get me a video of this, or somebody in Oshkosh who taped this, go to the TV station, get a copy, I'm begging you folks.
[01:25:27.196 --> 01:25:27.656]  But listen,
[01:25:28.857 --> 01:25:41.901]  all over the country now that there's a fugitive uh... they'll say that they think there might be a standoff in a car so they'll evacuate four or five streets uh... they do uh... a few years ago in L.A.
[01:25:43.002 --> 01:25:58.227]  a former cop in an upscale neighborhood was barricaded in his house and they set it on fire by the way and killed him armored vehicles drove in sort of shooting multiple houses they were shooting the houses couldn't even shoot the right house made everybody evacuate and then
[01:25:59.332 --> 01:26:02.554]  The feds have trained people for about five years.
[01:26:02.895 --> 01:26:08.018]  The police, how to round people up and send them to the local YMCA or sports stadium.
[01:26:08.799 --> 01:26:11.441]  And so this is really a martial law drill.
[01:26:11.501 --> 01:26:12.201]  Please continue.
[01:26:12.641 --> 01:26:13.762]  Well, absolutely it is.
[01:26:14.242 --> 01:26:23.109]  And when you see the reports of the people who would come home and they would find the police in their home, they did not give them consent.
[01:26:23.689 --> 01:26:27.852]  And people, honest, everyday law-abiding people were saying,
[01:26:28.396 --> 01:26:29.877]  You know, did you break into my house?
[01:26:30.037 --> 01:26:30.977]  How come, you know?
[01:26:31.297 --> 01:26:34.518]  They don't even understand their rights so far as to ask for a warrant.
[01:26:34.938 --> 01:26:36.019]  They're so far in the dark.
[01:26:36.359 --> 01:26:49.864]  But they know when somebody's in their house rummaging around that something isn't right, and they know that when the police are telling them in a very forceful, heavy-handed way to go spend the night at the local gymnasium, that, hmm, something isn't quite right here.
[01:26:50.504 --> 01:26:55.206]  And, you know, this comes down like a hammer on everyone.
[01:26:55.286 --> 01:26:57.087]  And that is, I think, a very important point.
[01:26:57.107 --> 01:26:57.827]  This isn't just
[01:26:58.308 --> 01:26:59.889]  Something that's going to affect the gun owners.
[01:27:00.289 --> 01:27:03.130]  Although I think that us gun owners are really feeling the pinch.
[01:27:04.130 --> 01:27:07.231]  But I think it's ultimately going to come down on everyone.
[01:27:09.652 --> 01:27:16.594]  This is the nature of tyranny when the government becomes the boss and tells us that it's for our own good.
[01:27:17.074 --> 01:27:18.335]  And that's happening right now.
[01:27:18.455 --> 01:27:21.376]  Government is declaring itself god-like powers.
[01:27:21.436 --> 01:27:21.816]  Go ahead.
[01:27:24.477 --> 01:27:25.257]  You're exactly right.
[01:27:25.277 --> 01:27:27.278]  And when you have government setting itself up
[01:27:29.574 --> 01:27:39.260]  Above God and making itself as, you know, turning the idea of the civil magistrate, you know, into an archaic idea, you have tyranny resulting.
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:44.303]  And anybody that understands history can see what's happening here.
[01:27:44.883 --> 01:27:53.688]  And when you essentially look at the regular everyday people in the reports surrounding this particular situation, you had people saying, well, you know,
[01:27:54.164 --> 01:27:55.505]  The police weren't so rude to me.
[01:27:55.525 --> 01:27:57.145]  They just asked me to leave for the night.
[01:27:57.205 --> 01:27:58.106]  It wasn't so bad.
[01:27:58.506 --> 01:28:03.848]  And I just had to clean up a few things in my kitchen and in my bedroom and, you know, in my stock drawer.
[01:28:04.168 --> 01:28:06.089]  Because, you know, they were going through my underwear.
[01:28:06.789 --> 01:28:09.150]  Well, that's something I want to point out before we break.
[01:28:09.170 --> 01:28:10.371]  We're going to come back with you, sir.
[01:28:11.091 --> 01:28:23.776]  Is that I have watched probably 50 times police search a family's car on the side of the road, leave their stuff everywhere, and then drive off for a woman with two of her children to pick up.
[01:28:24.770 --> 01:28:27.831]  Now, then I see some police put the spare tire back in and help them.
[01:28:28.352 --> 01:28:31.173]  It's bad enough to search them without a warrant, but to just drive off?
[01:28:31.673 --> 01:28:34.154]  Listen, you come in my house without a warrant, that's bad enough.
[01:28:34.555 --> 01:28:37.396]  Then you ransack everything and you want me to pick it up?
[01:28:37.576 --> 01:28:39.357]  What is wrong with you people?
[01:28:40.077 --> 01:28:41.017]  What is wrong with you?
[01:28:41.058 --> 01:28:42.278]  You're killing this country!
[01:28:43.899 --> 01:28:44.819]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.299 --> 01:28:46.920]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.821 --> 01:28:50.502]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.996 --> 01:28:56.298]  The sun is getting brighter and the days are getting longer.
[01:28:56.498 --> 01:28:57.819]  Summer's just around the corner.
[01:28:58.039 --> 01:28:59.260]  What are your plans for it?
[01:28:59.580 --> 01:28:59.961]  Fishing?
[01:29:00.241 --> 01:29:00.681]  Gardening?
[01:29:00.741 --> 01:29:01.142]  Camping?
[01:29:01.342 --> 01:29:03.503]  I'm sure you'll spend more time enjoying the outdoors.
[01:29:03.704 --> 01:29:06.906]  And I'm sure the ticks and mosquitoes will spend more time enjoying you.
[01:29:07.126 --> 01:29:09.488]  It's not just itching and scratching we have to worry about.
[01:29:09.768 --> 01:29:13.131]  Now there's incurable illnesses like Lyme disease and the West Nile virus.
[01:29:13.471 --> 01:29:18.595]  DEET is proven to keep the bugs away, but it's also proven to cause brain damage in laboratory animals.
[01:29:18.935 --> 01:29:21.396]  That's not a choice I want to make, and I don't have to.

[01:29:59.971 --> 01:30:06.134]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:30:06.415 --> 01:30:14.860]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.

[01:30:53.294 --> 01:30:54.715]  Somebody wants to sue you.

[01:32:02.389 --> 01:32:10.075]  They laid their bodies down in a bloody war for liberty for their descendants.
[01:32:11.035 --> 01:32:11.896]  Thanks to the renegades.
[01:32:11.956 --> 01:32:12.496]  Free today.

[01:32:32.998 --> 01:32:34.899]  We're free today.
[01:32:36.119 --> 01:32:41.522]  Let me tell you, that's how the war started.
[01:32:44.264 --> 01:32:47.865]  It wasn't the taxes, it wasn't the regulation, it wasn't all of that.
[01:32:48.526 --> 01:32:50.727]  When they started going to whole neighborhoods,
[01:32:52.023 --> 01:33:04.193]  Whole communities with hundreds of people searching their houses, their barns, tearing up the floorboards, ransacking homes, confiscating muskets, confiscating rifles.
[01:33:04.554 --> 01:33:05.735]  That's when it started.
[01:33:07.376 --> 01:33:08.957]  And people are so dumbed down.
[01:33:10.118 --> 01:33:18.966]  I mean, in Dallas, Texas, where I'm from, folks, if they go into the middle class neighborhoods and like to look at your firearms, like, well, no, you can't come in.
[01:33:18.986 --> 01:33:20.047]  Well, what do you have to hide, ma'am?
[01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:22.511]  Knock and talk.
[01:33:24.412 --> 01:33:26.112]  And that was the Fifth Circuit ruling.
[01:33:26.132 --> 01:33:27.133]  It was about knock and talk.
[01:33:27.153 --> 01:33:29.614]  Well, we just want to come into your neighborhood and knock and talk.
[01:33:30.275 --> 01:33:33.116]  About two and a half years ago, we even had her on the show.
[01:33:33.156 --> 01:33:34.417]  She won a lawsuit, by the way.
[01:33:35.017 --> 01:33:35.998]  They settled out of court.
[01:33:36.618 --> 01:33:40.840]  The sheriff, Margo Fraser, gets up on TV and says, we no longer need warrants.
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:41.681]  I have this on video.
[01:33:42.861 --> 01:33:45.123]  We no longer need warrants in Travis County.
[01:33:46.063 --> 01:33:46.664]  And the U.S.
[01:33:46.784 --> 01:33:48.124]  Army provided the helicopters.
[01:33:48.144 --> 01:33:48.805]  They went into a
[01:33:50.596 --> 01:33:57.160]  Hill Country area in the county and just walked off the road and searched all the houses on the street and didn't find any drugs.
[01:33:58.461 --> 01:34:08.007]  But harassed people, laid out their Playboy magazines and their underwear and made jokes out of them and made old ladies sit in fire ant beds and kick people's dogs.
[01:34:08.967 --> 01:34:09.908]  It was real funny!
[01:34:10.028 --> 01:34:11.288]  Just looking for drugs!
[01:34:13.470 --> 01:34:15.511]  And I see these stories all the time.
[01:34:16.011 --> 01:34:18.793]  Oregon last year, they went into a whole neighborhood
[01:34:20.473 --> 01:34:22.874]  A middle class neighborhood didn't find any drugs and the U.S.
[01:34:22.974 --> 01:34:31.177]  Army with an APC blocked the road, but one family had some potting soil in the Rose Garden and so they charged them with drug paraphernalia.
[01:34:31.878 --> 01:34:35.579]  I read the article, the AP article out of Oregon, folks.
[01:34:36.019 --> 01:34:37.000]  This is America.
[01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:39.041]  Every week I see articles like this.
[01:34:40.021 --> 01:34:41.222]  They think they're God.
[01:34:41.842 --> 01:34:44.003]  Not all the police, but these special units do.
[01:34:44.803 --> 01:34:49.445]  And they come in your neighborhood, ransack your homes, and then don't even put your stuff up.
[01:34:51.258 --> 01:34:52.999]  I've got friends who've been ransacked.
[01:34:54.119 --> 01:34:58.782]  The cable guy sees a gun in their house, isn't illegal, but calls, so they SWAT team you at 4 a.m.
[01:34:58.822 --> 01:35:00.803]  and say, oh, we got a 911 call from your house.
[01:35:00.823 --> 01:35:01.803]  Well, no, you didn't, I was asleep.
[01:35:01.823 --> 01:35:05.445]  Oh, well, we're going to ransack your house and see if any of your guns are illegal while we're here.
[01:35:05.765 --> 01:35:08.626]  That's another one of their favorite tricks, these 911 numbers.
[01:35:08.686 --> 01:35:09.687]  Oh, we got a 911 call.
[01:35:09.887 --> 01:35:10.687]  Well, show me your record.
[01:35:10.707 --> 01:35:12.808]  Oh, well, there's not one, but shut up, I have a machine gun.
[01:35:15.690 --> 01:35:20.212]  Alright, let's bring Debbie Morrow up for a few minutes, then we'll go back to Corey
[01:35:20.996 --> 01:35:29.379]  graph of gun owners of America unit out in uh... out in Wisconsin and we'll go right to your calls I promise but uh... Debbie?
[01:35:29.399 --> 01:35:30.479]  Yeah, hi Alex!
[01:35:31.499 --> 01:35:32.139]  How you doing?
[01:35:32.419 --> 01:35:35.961]  We've got one way to at least get out of their system, that's stop drinking their water.
[01:35:36.741 --> 01:35:41.002]  We've got a purification system made in America that's top of the line.
[01:35:41.042 --> 01:35:41.782]  How do folks get it?
[01:35:42.623 --> 01:35:46.524]  They can get the Berkey water filters by either calling me toll free at 1-888-803-4438
[01:35:51.411 --> 01:36:02.114]  Or they can go to our website, which is Berkeywater.com, which is spelled B-E-R-K-E-Y-W-A-T-E-R dot com.
[01:36:02.774 --> 01:36:07.736]  Of course, they can also go to Infowars.com, you know, and order from there.
[01:36:07.756 --> 01:36:13.777]  If they have any questions, if they want to know about the specials, they're welcome to call me anytime.
[01:36:13.838 --> 01:36:15.438]  If they do go to the Infowars
[01:36:16.258 --> 01:36:24.701]  on website that in the comments they need to be sure to put what free gift they'd like as well as at the Berkeywater.com.
[01:36:24.741 --> 01:36:27.082]  They need to put that they're an Alex Jones listener.
[01:36:27.102 --> 01:36:29.022]  Well tell the folks about the free gifts.
[01:36:29.062 --> 01:36:29.843]  These are valuable.
[01:36:30.243 --> 01:36:31.003]  They really are.
[01:36:31.023 --> 01:36:34.584]  The Berkeywater filter comes in two models.
[01:36:34.764 --> 01:36:38.786]  One with lights in the base and one without lights in the base.
[01:36:39.506 --> 01:36:42.307]  One without lights is $199 and with it you get to pick one free gift.
[01:36:45.646 --> 01:36:50.168]  The one with lights is $2.59 and you get to pick two free gifts.
[01:36:50.789 --> 01:37:00.793]  The gifts are either the Berkey Sport Bottle, which is a 22-ounce handheld filtered water bottle that refills up to about 640 refills.
[01:37:02.214 --> 01:37:04.575]  It takes out a lot of pathogens and everything.
[01:37:04.595 --> 01:37:07.357]  It's great to have when you're just out and about on the go.
[01:37:07.837 --> 01:37:11.879]  Great for gifts, travel, soccer team, you know, whatever.
[01:37:12.749 --> 01:37:14.890]  You need to have water while you're out and about.
[01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:16.191]  It's real handy.
[01:37:16.951 --> 01:37:23.054]  We also have a bottle of potassium iodate, which I've had a lot of people ask me about potassium iodate lately.
[01:37:23.114 --> 01:37:29.697]  They wanted to know the difference between it and potassium iodide, which potassium iodate is what we offer.
[01:37:30.257 --> 01:37:31.037]  It's buffered.
[01:37:31.117 --> 01:37:36.580]  It has one more molecule of oxygen, and it's more digestible for children and animals.
[01:37:38.022 --> 01:37:42.546]  Yeah, even most adults in the military have trouble with potassium iodine.
[01:37:42.586 --> 01:37:49.831]  That's if there's a radiological event, nuclear or dirty bomb, you take this and it fills the thyroid with good iodine so you don't die.
[01:37:49.851 --> 01:37:53.454]  That's the number one cause of death if you're not killed by the blast itself.
[01:37:53.974 --> 01:37:55.595]  It's just something good to have.
[01:37:55.876 --> 01:37:58.878]  They've issued it to federal workers quietly a year ago.
[01:38:00.140 --> 01:38:04.323]  But again, they have the big purification units for $199 with one free gift.
[01:38:04.343 --> 01:38:06.084]  These things will cost you $300 in the store.
[01:38:06.444 --> 01:38:08.746]  Gravity-fed purification units.
[01:38:08.766 --> 01:38:11.648]  The little sport bottles are good for lake water, creek water.
[01:38:11.688 --> 01:38:13.449]  They just make it to where it's safe to drink.
[01:38:13.790 --> 01:38:16.211]  The big purification units cut it all out, folks.
[01:38:16.612 --> 01:38:21.215]  They've got a $259 deal where you get two free gifts and the built-in LED lights in the base.
[01:38:22.496 --> 01:38:23.216]  A great system.
[01:38:23.296 --> 01:38:24.157]  I have one myself.
[01:38:25.198 --> 01:38:28.239]  In fact, Debbie, will you charge me for two?
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:29.840]  I keep meaning to do this.
[01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:31.781]  One of my friends wants one and he's going to pay me for it.
[01:38:31.801 --> 01:38:34.542]  Will you send me two Berkey lights without the light?
[01:38:34.602 --> 01:38:35.702]  I keep forgetting now that you're on the air.
[01:38:35.722 --> 01:38:36.423]  Will you do that for me?
[01:38:37.403 --> 01:38:38.264]  You know how busy I am.
[01:38:38.324 --> 01:38:41.845]  What do you want for your free gift?
[01:38:42.685 --> 01:38:46.047]  Give me the prudent places and with one and then give me the
[01:38:47.563 --> 01:38:49.765]  But the other one, give me the shelter in place.
[01:38:50.246 --> 01:38:51.027]  Okay.
[01:38:51.067 --> 01:38:58.114]  But again, folks, the toll-free number to give Debbie a call, 1-888-803-4438.
[01:38:58.554 --> 01:39:01.017]  And if the phone's busy, leave your name and number, she'll call you right back.
[01:39:01.793 --> 01:39:06.794]  1-888-803-4438 or Berkeywater.com.
[01:39:06.834 --> 01:39:07.475]  Take care, Debbie.
[01:39:07.815 --> 01:39:13.656]  Okay, and Alex, remember that we offer that KDF shower filter special through the end of the month.
[01:39:13.856 --> 01:39:17.777]  Because even if you filter the water, you get a lot of it in your lungs and your skin from the shower.
[01:39:18.057 --> 01:39:20.838]  Right, so be sure to have people asking about that, too.
[01:39:21.118 --> 01:39:23.279]  Get that for what, like half price or something?
[01:39:23.299 --> 01:39:23.739]  $27 instead of $49.
[01:39:24.833 --> 01:39:25.914]  All right.
[01:39:26.754 --> 01:39:27.375]  Take care, Debbie.
[01:39:27.395 --> 01:39:27.895]  Great job.
[01:39:28.075 --> 01:39:28.696]  Bye-bye.
[01:39:28.796 --> 01:39:29.216]  That's 1-888-803-4438.
[01:39:29.456 --> 01:39:33.219]  Stop procrastinating.
[01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:43.967]  Let's go back to Corey Graff, and again the website, wisconsingunowners.org, a link at infowars.com.
[01:39:44.407 --> 01:39:47.430]  Anything else you want to add, Corey, before we go to calls?
[01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:51.933]  Well, there is one very important thing, and that is during these massive
[01:39:52.946 --> 01:39:58.229]  We've, these mass searches that have occurred up here in Wisconsin and Oshkosh.
[01:39:58.889 --> 01:40:03.592]  There was one home that police found a marijuana growing operation.
[01:40:04.032 --> 01:40:08.494]  And I want to be very perfectly clear, we do not condone the growing of marijuana.
[01:40:08.554 --> 01:40:11.376]  We're not pushing drug use.
[01:40:11.396 --> 01:40:19.760]  The crime of a warrantless search to the country and our freedom and tyranny is much worse than some marijuana.
[01:40:20.439 --> 01:40:29.459]  Right, and so essentially we have a precedent now where you have the police going in to a broad area and look what we found here, look what we found there.
[01:40:29.479 --> 01:40:31.183]  Hey, this is interesting.
[01:40:31.804 --> 01:40:33.745]  And you have a broad prospect.
[01:40:33.765 --> 01:40:39.709]  Did you hear about the Illinois town last year where people wake up and brush their teeth and cops are in their house?
[01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:45.193]  Where for zoning rules, oh you're only allowed to have three people in your house even if you own your house.
[01:40:45.533 --> 01:40:51.977]  They come in and do unannounced warrantless inspections of all the homes in the town and look for things while they're inside.
[01:40:53.158 --> 01:40:55.840]  You know, I haven't heard of that but I'm not surprised.
[01:40:55.860 --> 01:40:57.041]  I think it's Maryville.
[01:40:58.202 --> 01:40:58.762]  It's happening.
[01:40:59.474 --> 01:41:00.315]  Yeah.
[01:41:00.515 --> 01:41:01.256]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:41:01.516 --> 01:41:05.599]  So they actually arrested the people that had the marijuana?
[01:41:05.939 --> 01:41:10.923]  Right, they arrested the people that had the marijuana, and they're now being prosecuted.
[01:41:10.943 --> 01:41:14.406]  I thought they were looking for guns!
[01:41:15.147 --> 01:41:23.654]  Well... And of course these people won't get a good lawyer, or don't know their rights, and don't know that this whole thing's gotta be thrown out.
[01:41:24.366 --> 01:41:33.989]  We have to realize, one of the individuals who had his gun stolen, and I use that term stolen because it's very appropriate, he actually received his gun back.
[01:41:34.389 --> 01:41:40.651]  And he actually received an apology from police, and it was reported in the media that he would not press charges.
[01:41:41.031 --> 01:41:53.635]  Now, I saw this individual on camera, and he had a big smile on his face, and he said, well, you know, I'm not going to let the police come in without a warrant next time, but, you know, they said they're sorry, and they're just doing their job, and, you know, let's just all be happy little serfs.
[01:41:54.226 --> 01:41:58.249]  Well, I agree, but I also want to add that we're going to calls
[01:42:11.238 --> 01:42:13.579]  I don't know about Oshkosh, but let's take Texas.
[01:42:13.639 --> 01:42:14.460]  Tulia, Texas.
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:15.700]  Dallas, Texas.
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:16.961]  Houston, Texas.
[01:42:17.381 --> 01:42:18.722]  San Antonio, Texas.
[01:42:19.262 --> 01:42:20.442]  El Paso, Texas.
[01:42:20.943 --> 01:42:21.763]  Austin, Texas.
[01:42:22.363 --> 01:42:31.828]  In the last few years, they've caught police in every city framing people, and I mean industrial frame-ups, where they pull you over, throw a bag of chalk in the back of your car,
[01:42:32.569 --> 01:42:43.254]  Take your home, take your car, some cases take your children, and then the crime lab certifies it as cocaine, and then they go ahead and prosecute you, until good cops blew the whistle.
[01:42:44.235 --> 01:42:47.456]  People being arrested, no drugs or paraphernalia found, being taken to jail.
[01:42:47.776 --> 01:42:55.500]  When you get criminal crews, actual mafia crews, sometimes you get mafia police chiefs in, you're in trouble.
[01:42:57.697 --> 01:42:59.678]  And that may be what's going on here.
[01:42:59.758 --> 01:43:08.062]  It's hard to say, but when you see the demeanor of the police when they speak of these issues, you see a cold, robotic response.
[01:43:08.123 --> 01:43:13.045]  There's no remorse for their actions, and there certainly isn't any respect for citizens' rights.
[01:43:13.545 --> 01:43:15.947]  Okay, Matt and Mort were next.
[01:43:16.047 --> 01:43:18.248]  They just hung up, so we got some open lines.
[01:43:18.268 --> 01:43:18.808]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:43:18.828 --> 01:43:19.488]  Let's go to callers quickly.
[01:43:19.509 --> 01:43:19.909]  Let's talk to
[01:43:26.733 --> 01:43:28.574]  I guess up next, who's up next here?
[01:43:29.594 --> 01:43:31.175]  Eric in Tennessee, go ahead Eric.
[01:43:31.475 --> 01:43:32.655]  Hey Alex, how you doing today?
[01:43:32.816 --> 01:43:33.096]  Good.
[01:43:33.376 --> 01:43:35.216]  Hey Corey, glad you're on the show today.
[01:43:35.397 --> 01:43:35.637]  Thanks.
[01:43:36.377 --> 01:43:39.058]  What I was wanting to say, first of all I wanted to make kind of a little joke here.
[01:43:39.358 --> 01:43:45.401]  You know why we're having trouble with the American people not standing up and allowing the police to do this kind of stuff?
[01:43:45.921 --> 01:43:48.782]  Is I think most Americans, I think they're Egyptians.
[01:43:49.437 --> 01:43:50.658]  Because they live in denial.
[01:43:52.719 --> 01:43:55.380]  But anyway, two things I want to bring up real quick.
[01:43:55.420 --> 01:43:56.681]  I know I get the other callers.
[01:43:57.081 --> 01:44:10.888]  First of all, the other day I observed in Nashville, I observed an unmarked, looked like a motorcycle, police motorcycle, guy in fatigues, with a black helmet with a number on the back of it.
[01:44:11.168 --> 01:44:14.109]  It was a black helmet with white numbers, and he had a firearm.
[01:44:14.670 --> 01:44:17.531]  And he was going along in traffic there.
[01:44:18.289 --> 01:44:22.812]  And the closest military base, I was thinking, well maybe it was the military police or something like that.
[01:44:22.832 --> 01:44:26.875]  But the closest base is Fort Campbell, which is about 50 miles away.
[01:44:27.055 --> 01:44:30.938]  Look, all over the country there's now FEMA National Police popping up.
[01:44:32.779 --> 01:44:36.021]  This sounds crazy, even foreign troops have been with them at checkpoints.
[01:44:36.502 --> 01:44:39.163]  And I have police chiefs admitting that in a film made in 99, by the way.
[01:44:39.824 --> 01:44:41.145]  All this is going on
[01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:44.622]  And, uh, it's just horrible.
[01:44:45.063 --> 01:44:50.547]  Remember during the income tax battle in your state a few years ago, where they said no protest allowed, finally?
[01:44:50.567 --> 01:44:52.688]  I mean, everywhere it's this tyranny.
[01:44:53.649 --> 01:44:55.631]  Yeah, they blocked off the courthouse.
[01:44:56.011 --> 01:45:03.237]  We were driving around, honking, protesting when the government was in session, and then they finally said, oh, you can't do that anymore, started blocking it off.
[01:45:03.817 --> 01:45:06.139]  Real quick, I want y'all just to expand real quick.
[01:45:06.559 --> 01:45:11.183]  We've already lost half of our Second Amendment, because, you know, it says to keep and bear arm.
[01:45:11.707 --> 01:45:17.289]  Bearing arms means, to me, how I understand it, is that you can carry arms anywhere you want to go.
[01:45:17.309 --> 01:45:20.809]  Well, it's the same thing with like Vermont or Virginia, but people don't even know their rights.
[01:45:20.829 --> 01:45:21.490]  Thanks for the call.
[01:45:21.550 --> 01:45:22.410]  Comments, Corey?
[01:45:24.871 --> 01:45:26.791]  The militarization of the police.
[01:45:27.431 --> 01:45:39.295]  And I don't know how it is down in Tennessee or in Texas, although I can guess, but certainly in Wisconsin, the police drive around with fully automatic AR-15s fully visible in the back window of their vehicles.
[01:45:39.335 --> 01:45:40.855]  They want to make sure everybody can see
[01:45:41.431 --> 01:45:46.417]  But they've got a fully automatic military-type weapon readily accessible now.
[01:45:47.238 --> 01:45:49.240]  The police themselves have shifted.
[01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:50.241]  The paradigm has shifted.
[01:45:50.561 --> 01:45:55.727]  It's no longer Mr. Nice Policeman who's going to come and help get your kitty out of the tree in the backyard.
[01:45:56.208 --> 01:46:01.894]  Now Mr. Policeman is Darth Vader's stormtrooper and he's ready to go to war.
[01:46:03.177 --> 01:46:08.019]  I don't see anybody, you know, justifying that war in my neighborhood, but apparently they're getting ready for that.
[01:46:08.039 --> 01:46:13.181]  Well, look, they're about to sack this country economically, and they've got to let us know who the bosses are.
[01:46:14.141 --> 01:46:17.242]  The prison population now, it's seven million folks and growing.
[01:46:17.962 --> 01:46:20.663]  Let's go ahead and go to John in Tennessee.
[01:46:20.783 --> 01:46:21.624]  John, you're on the air.
[01:46:21.664 --> 01:46:22.084]  Go ahead.
[01:46:23.844 --> 01:46:27.506]  Hello, I wanted to comment about the illegal searches in Wisconsin.
[01:46:28.806 --> 01:46:30.067]  In Bradley County, Tennessee,
[01:46:32.287 --> 01:46:35.772]  This month a cop claimed he was shot by a passing car in the interstate.
[01:46:35.812 --> 01:46:38.776]  The bullet went through his windshield and through the canine dog cage.
[01:46:39.317 --> 01:46:43.662]  So the police shut down I-75 for several hours and I saw that happen.
[01:46:44.443 --> 01:46:48.529]  Last week it was announced the cop shot his own car and lied so he was fired.
[01:46:49.011 --> 01:46:52.093]  It may face criminal charges for filing a false police report.
[01:46:52.133 --> 01:46:56.075]  Well, it's like, uh, the so-called, you know, pipe bomber in New York.
[01:46:56.156 --> 01:46:57.576]  Turns out they think it's the cop.
[01:46:58.197 --> 01:47:02.299]  But in a lot of these cases, it's actual drills they're doing, which they say are real.
[01:47:02.339 --> 01:47:02.760]  Go ahead.
[01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:03.440]  Right.
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:10.665]  And it's the same sheriff's department in Bradley County that confiscated $1.1 million cash during a routine traffic stop in April.
[01:47:11.245 --> 01:47:13.126]  And the sheriff kept all the money for himself.
[01:47:13.206 --> 01:47:17.289]  None of it went to the general fund for the benefit of reducing taxes or anything.
[01:47:18.154 --> 01:47:24.317]  So maybe this cop in Oshkosh shot himself or was shot by one of his fellow cops or by a criminal police informant.
[01:47:24.837 --> 01:47:26.218]  Well, that's what you said at the time.
[01:47:26.258 --> 01:47:28.379]  Do you have the news article now saying they fired him?
[01:47:28.799 --> 01:47:29.819]  Yes, he's been fired.
[01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:31.820]  And he may face criminal charges.
[01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:33.261]  You said that a few weeks ago.
[01:47:33.281 --> 01:47:35.142]  You said, I think this is the cops going after him.
[01:47:36.283 --> 01:47:40.226]  Well, he could have been, you know, somebody upset about him screwing his wife or something.
[01:47:40.286 --> 01:47:41.688]  That's pretty common with these guys.
[01:47:41.728 --> 01:47:42.989]  Please watch your language, sir.
[01:47:43.309 --> 01:47:45.851]  I appreciate the call, but John has sent us some good news articles.
[01:47:46.492 --> 01:47:48.233]  Let's go to Steve in Texas.
[01:47:48.273 --> 01:47:48.974]  Steve, go ahead.
[01:47:49.875 --> 01:47:50.155]  Hello.
[01:47:50.495 --> 01:47:50.715]  Yes.
[01:47:53.017 --> 01:47:55.700]  Talking about the police and... Yeah, I'm having audio problems.
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:56.680]  Can we boost the callers?
[01:47:56.981 --> 01:47:57.341]  Go ahead.
[01:47:58.001 --> 01:48:00.684]  Talking about the police and law enforcement and things.
[01:48:01.351 --> 01:48:11.553]  One of the things that you talk about on a regular basis is how they're getting rid of all the sheriff's departments because they're constitutionally based organizations and then going to the police.
[01:48:11.573 --> 01:48:14.534]  Well, they're elected, therefore accountable to the people.
[01:48:14.694 --> 01:48:15.814]  We're now the slaves.
[01:48:15.874 --> 01:48:16.914]  They're now God.
[01:48:16.974 --> 01:48:19.835]  They can't have mortals appointing God.
[01:48:20.215 --> 01:48:20.735]  Exactly.
[01:48:20.755 --> 01:48:24.376]  Fairville, Texas today.
[01:48:25.196 --> 01:48:26.416]  Top story in the newspaper.
[01:48:27.148 --> 01:48:32.212]  County Commissioners approved study resolution to merge all of the county's law enforcement.
[01:48:32.992 --> 01:48:38.336]  The City of Kerbal Police, Ingram City Marshal's Office, and the Kerr County Sheriff's Department.
[01:48:38.656 --> 01:48:45.862]  Multi-jurisdictional task force now taking control of the elected representative of the people.
[01:48:45.942 --> 01:48:47.123]  That is horrible!
[01:48:47.543 --> 01:48:49.204]  You've got to stop that, people.
[01:48:49.564 --> 01:48:50.805]  Let's get a comment from our guest.
[01:48:50.965 --> 01:48:51.606]  Corey, go ahead.
[01:48:52.406 --> 01:49:10.071]  You know, just tying in what Steve said, you know, regarding the Oshkosh gun complications last week, you know, we would have liked to have seen the Brown, excuse me, the Winnebago County, that's the county that Oshkosh is in, Winnebago County Sheriff, interceding on behalf of the people.
[01:49:10.131 --> 01:49:12.572]  Look, they're elected to protect and serve them.
[01:49:13.052 --> 01:49:21.234]  I would have liked them to have seen the Sheriff step up and do his job, his constitutionally, you know, designated job.
[01:49:21.727 --> 01:49:24.409]  If they hold it, you're not coming into this old lady's home.
[01:49:24.749 --> 01:49:26.230]  You're not going to break into this home.
[01:49:26.810 --> 01:49:30.393]  And certainly, as soon as they get rid of the sheriff, we're in big trouble.
[01:49:30.733 --> 01:49:37.057]  But instead of just turning the sheriffs into rubber stamps, they're now going to get rid of them and merge them in.
[01:49:37.077 --> 01:49:42.201]  And in some states, they're housing them in the National Guard armories under federal control.
[01:49:43.101 --> 01:49:44.302]  Anything else, Steve?
[01:49:45.343 --> 01:49:46.184]  Keep up the good work.
[01:49:46.745 --> 01:49:48.727]  Send me that news article online.
[01:49:48.747 --> 01:49:49.447]  I'd like to post it.
[01:49:49.908 --> 01:49:50.588]  We'll be back.
[01:49:50.789 --> 01:49:51.229]  Stay with us.
[01:49:51.269 --> 01:49:52.050]  More calls coming up.
[01:49:53.780 --> 01:49:55.300]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.461 --> 01:49:58.541]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.681 --> 01:50:02.583]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.623 --> 01:50:06.864]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:07.204 --> 01:50:10.985]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.125 --> 01:50:12.986]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:13.106 --> 01:50:16.447]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[01:50:16.487 --> 01:50:17.567]  The medical bills!
[01:50:19.167 --> 01:50:21.188]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.348 --> 01:50:24.389]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.549 --> 01:50:27.470]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:34.052]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.572 --> 01:50:38.353]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[01:50:38.753 --> 01:50:40.134]  Order your video today.
[01:50:40.514 --> 01:50:41.514]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[01:50:41.574 --> 01:50:43.815]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[01:50:43.875 --> 01:50:45.115]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[01:50:52.958 --> 01:51:00.482]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:51:00.743 --> 01:51:11.669]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:51:11.929 --> 01:51:13.730]  Yet require very little energy.
[01:51:14.010 --> 01:51:17.331]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:51:17.671 --> 01:51:28.094]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:51:28.414 --> 01:51:28.915]  That's right!
[01:51:29.095 --> 01:51:36.222]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:51:36.502 --> 01:51:40.626]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[01:51:40.786 --> 01:51:45.251]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:45.311 --> 01:51:45.771]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:54.614 --> 01:51:54.954]  I think so.
[01:52:09.861 --> 01:52:10.502]  We're good to go.

[01:52:56.900 --> 01:52:59.442]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[01:52:59.922 --> 01:53:03.205]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:05.066 --> 01:53:09.409]  Did you ever think you'd see the Supreme Court saying they follow U.N.
[01:53:09.509 --> 01:53:10.070]  rulings?
[01:53:10.090 --> 01:53:13.372]  Did you ever think you'd hear the court saying there's no Fourth Amendment?
[01:53:15.294 --> 01:53:20.938]  Or if you are a demonstrator, you are inside a cage underneath
[01:53:21.824 --> 01:53:32.191]  A railway station a half mile from the convention inside another cage with men aiming machine guns at you like you're an evil demon.
[01:53:33.211 --> 01:53:35.012]  The government is making us the slaves.
[01:53:35.513 --> 01:53:37.394]  And it's all for our own good, of course.
[01:53:38.183 --> 01:53:47.985]  And now we've got to come in your house, ransack things for drugs or guns or whatever, and it's our authority and we don't need warrants, the Austin Sheriff said a few years ago on TV.
[01:53:48.025 --> 01:53:51.145]  We no longer need warrants.
[01:53:51.546 --> 01:53:53.426]  Well, why'd we need them before, lady?
[01:53:54.406 --> 01:54:04.388]  And then on top of it, these multi-jurisdictional task forces start up, then they get rid of the counties and have these FEMA command centers be the base of everything.
[01:54:06.090 --> 01:54:07.171]  It's so horrible.
[01:54:07.211 --> 01:54:10.654]  We're talking to Corey Graff from Wisconsin.
[01:54:10.674 --> 01:54:12.255]  Heads up the Gun Owners Group up there.
[01:54:12.275 --> 01:54:14.357]  And we're taking calls.
[01:54:14.878 --> 01:54:22.564]  Let's go ahead and go to Kevin and Mass, then William and many, many others that are patiently holding.
[01:54:22.624 --> 01:54:24.526]  William and Marty and Jonathan and Daryl.
[01:54:25.226 --> 01:54:25.667]  Go ahead.
[01:54:25.687 --> 01:54:26.608]  You're on the air, Kevin.
[01:54:27.028 --> 01:54:27.308]  Hello.
[01:54:27.348 --> 01:54:28.769]  Thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[01:54:29.370 --> 01:54:31.352]  I was previously a
[01:54:32.369 --> 01:54:43.974]  Self-described proud Kennedy Liberal Democrat and I want to just point out from one of your comments earlier about getting your films that I'm from Mass and I'm somebody who did deprogram.
[01:54:44.994 --> 01:54:50.497]  I'm much more now to have been a caller in on the Ann Coulter Show who brought up Bohemian Grove.
[01:54:50.797 --> 01:54:52.958]  I heard you said that was your most requested interview.
[01:54:54.438 --> 01:55:00.201]  I'm calling today, I got on NPR and other people armed with your videos and what you can learn listening to your show
[01:55:00.663 --> 01:55:02.163]  We can get on other mainstream things.
[01:55:02.203 --> 01:55:04.184]  They screen their calls, unlike yours.
[01:55:04.664 --> 01:55:10.286]  But if you don't go into Skull and Bones on the screen, you can get through the screen and get on the air.
[01:55:10.326 --> 01:55:16.207]  And I was able to talk about the things that are talked about regularly on this show, but never in the mainstream media.
[01:55:16.607 --> 01:55:21.809]  I want to thank you for providing the information and educating us so that we can get out and do our little bit.
[01:55:21.949 --> 01:55:25.730]  Well, let me just say this, and it really means a lot to me, your call, Kevin, and stay right there.
[01:55:26.430 --> 01:55:26.910]  But again,
[01:55:27.691 --> 01:55:39.638]  If I'll expose the hypocrisy of the Republican Party, but then be a real libertarian-slash-conservative freedom lover, I'm able to wake up liberals out of their false elitist enslavement paradigm.
[01:55:39.678 --> 01:55:48.283]  But liberals are never going to wake up hearing about how Dick Cheney is this wonderful, uncorrupt person.
[01:55:48.784 --> 01:55:55.548]  So if we get down to real issues and really talk to people, not try to balkanize
[01:55:56.028 --> 01:55:57.429]  We can bring this country together.
[01:55:57.469 --> 01:55:57.849]  Go ahead.
[01:55:58.129 --> 01:56:15.020]  Well, that's what, you know, the NPR commentator tried to, you know, and they had a writer from the Globe there, and they tried to say, well, you know, he's more compassionate than Bush, and tried to bait me back into, you know, knowing that I'm a Democrat, to bashing Bush.
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:23.685]  And I said, was able to bring up the information that's provided here and a couple of other places, that they're third cousins through the Forbes side of the family, that they both work for
[01:56:24.286 --> 01:56:33.532]  An oligarchy of elitist bankers, and that they're on the same, you know, agenda, and that I brought up the diabolical touchscreen voting.
[01:56:33.572 --> 01:56:35.633]  And they let you get that out on the air?
[01:56:35.914 --> 01:56:37.214]  I got it out.
[01:56:37.555 --> 01:56:44.339]  I don't think they'll be playing that one again, but I was able to get that on the air, and I was astonished myself.
[01:56:44.359 --> 01:56:45.000]  Well, good job.
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:49.923]  Let's get a comment from our guest, who I hope can stay a little bit more with us in the next hour to take calls.
[01:56:51.084 --> 01:56:53.145]  Corey, what do you say to what our caller just said?
[01:56:54.251 --> 01:57:02.595]  Well, I think the caller is, you know, addressing, you know, the issue in the media with the censorship and the filtering out of the truth.
[01:57:03.195 --> 01:57:11.219]  And, you know, just tying that in with the Oshkosh gun confiscation situation, I have to make the point, and I think the caller makes the point for me.
[01:57:12.719 --> 01:57:20.543]  We're talking about several situations that we know that we have comments from real people talking about what they've really seen, what they've really experienced.
[01:57:21.297 --> 01:57:25.700]  But I have to wonder, how many people were too scared to say something on camera?
[01:57:26.060 --> 01:57:37.987]  How many people were tyrannized, you know, or, or, uh, seriously, uh, uh, you know, their houses ravaged, and they just, there was no camera there to hear what they had to say.
[01:57:38.147 --> 01:57:39.808]  I tell you what, stay there, sir.
[01:57:39.868 --> 01:57:42.569]  We'll be back with all your calls third hour.
[01:57:42.589 --> 01:57:44.430]  Archie.
[01:57:50.014 --> 01:57:50.614]  Big brother.
[01:57:51.309 --> 01:57:52.349]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.070 --> 01:57:54.170]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.830 --> 01:57:55.671]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.411 --> 01:57:58.332]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.352 --> 01:58:01.613]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.153 --> 01:58:06.274]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.835 --> 01:58:11.076]  Alright folks, into hour number three.
[01:58:11.236 --> 01:58:14.237]  A ton of news we haven't gotten to yet is coming up.
[01:58:14.337 --> 01:58:15.498]  Your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:19.449 --> 01:58:25.034]  Our final segment with the head of Wisconsin Gun Owners, affiliated with Gun Owners of America.
[01:58:26.455 --> 01:58:34.142]  Oshkosh police conduct door-to-door gun confiscations, and while they were at it, without warrants, they were grabbing people's marijuana plants, you name it.
[01:58:34.522 --> 01:58:36.944]  Go and see, we don't need warrants, we catch criminals!
[01:58:37.485 --> 01:58:41.288]  The point is, the tyranny is a much greater threat than somebody growing marijuana.
[01:58:42.473 --> 01:58:44.995]  And this is so... What about the criminals in government?
[01:58:45.015 --> 01:58:46.156]  Who's going to tie their hands?
[01:58:46.196 --> 01:58:46.856]  Well, they're not!
[01:58:47.276 --> 01:58:48.337]  And that's called tyranny.
[01:58:48.777 --> 01:58:50.538]  And they know we're waking up to their tyranny.
[01:58:50.558 --> 01:58:52.740]  That's why they're putting on Darth Vader outfits.
[01:58:53.180 --> 01:58:56.562]  That's why they're sticking machine guns in our faces, building lots of FEMA centers.
[01:58:57.763 --> 01:58:59.804]  Final comments, Corey.
[01:59:01.025 --> 01:59:11.732]  We have a white ticket fence neighborhood in an average Midwestern town with regular folks who are being terrorized by the police in a very specific
[01:59:12.145 --> 01:59:12.325]  I don't
[01:59:24.568 --> 01:59:26.108]  We're not advocating revolution here.
[01:59:26.128 --> 01:59:28.529]  We're not trying to sound radical or extreme.
[01:59:28.809 --> 01:59:31.790]  We just simply want the police to do things by the rules.
[01:59:31.850 --> 01:59:32.930]  Let me stop you right there.
[01:59:32.970 --> 01:59:33.550]  Let me stop you.
[01:59:34.330 --> 01:59:36.551]  My definition, we are restorationists.
[01:59:36.651 --> 01:59:38.211]  We are counter-revolutionaries.
[01:59:38.611 --> 01:59:40.452]  They are destroying our Bill of Rights.
[01:59:40.852 --> 01:59:43.192]  They are violating our freedoms, the basic canons.
[01:59:43.592 --> 01:59:45.413]  They are the revolutionaries.
[01:59:45.713 --> 01:59:47.173]  They are the seditionists.
[01:59:47.954 --> 01:59:48.914]  Yeah, I think that's a good point.
[01:59:48.934 --> 01:59:49.814]  You know, we're often
[01:59:50.605 --> 01:59:56.693]  Uh, accused of being anti-government when we expose these various items of tyranny.
[01:59:57.033 --> 01:59:59.896]  But you know, we're not trying to subvert the Constitution.
[01:59:59.936 --> 02:00:02.199]  We're not trying to throw the Bill of Rights out the window.
[02:00:02.219 --> 02:00:05.283]  And we're not trying to trample on people's God-given rights.
[02:00:06.404 --> 02:00:10.309]  We're trying to just stick to, you know, the basic tenets that this country was founded on.
[02:00:10.974 --> 02:00:14.796]  And, you know, I gotta say, Alex, if it can happen in Oscos, it can happen anywhere.
[02:00:15.017 --> 02:00:16.377]  It goes on all the time.
[02:00:16.477 --> 02:00:18.399]  I mean, it's not just a gun situation.
[02:00:18.919 --> 02:00:21.701]  Don't think there's a standoff in a car and evacuate half the neighborhood.
[02:00:21.961 --> 02:00:25.983]  You mentioned how they had people on the news saying they loved it, they hated it, it was horrible, whatever.
[02:00:26.564 --> 02:00:33.808]  I have a friend who works at the Austin Airport, and when they were gonna have all this extra security, he watched News 8 interview about 50 people.
[02:00:34.428 --> 02:00:40.312]  Everybody said they hated it and did no good, and one old lady said she loved it, and guess who was on the news?
[02:00:42.932 --> 02:00:44.072]  Let me guess, the little old lady.
[02:00:44.813 --> 02:00:45.493]  You got it, though.
[02:00:45.573 --> 02:00:47.053]  I mean, literally, he sat there and counted.
[02:00:47.233 --> 02:00:48.834]  I think he said actually 45 people.
[02:00:49.614 --> 02:00:53.515]  Until they got to her, and she loved it, so she was on the news.
[02:00:53.935 --> 02:00:57.436]  This is why alternative media is so important.
[02:00:58.697 --> 02:01:00.597]  Do you have access TV in Oshkosh?
[02:01:01.618 --> 02:01:09.300]  Um, you know, I'm not sure what they have down there, but I know that it's literally amazing that this story
[02:01:10.078 --> 02:01:11.739]  was brought to the light that it was.
[02:01:11.839 --> 02:01:13.479]  You need to get your own show.
[02:01:13.499 --> 02:01:17.061]  You need to go down and get a once a week radio show or an AXS TV show.
[02:01:17.481 --> 02:01:19.562]  Something to get more numbers together.
[02:01:19.902 --> 02:01:21.782]  I'm telling you that's how you can turn the tide.
[02:01:21.802 --> 02:01:25.924]  And I mean for every hamlet and town and metropolis in this country.
[02:01:27.325 --> 02:01:34.907]  We're certainly going to do our best up here and you know just using the same strategies that Gun Owners of America has used on a national level.
[02:01:35.308 --> 02:01:39.209]  We're galvanizing gun owners and we're not going to accept any compromise on this issue.
[02:01:39.733 --> 02:01:45.052]  And we, you know, our intention is to hold the police department accountable and to get the truth out there.
[02:01:45.618 --> 02:01:53.461]  Well, that video of that old lady coming out of the ransacker house and saying she woke up to them in her kitchen, that is invaluable.
[02:01:53.561 --> 02:01:55.102]  Please try to get that, my friend.
[02:01:55.322 --> 02:01:56.422]  We will be on top of it, Alex.
[02:01:56.782 --> 02:01:59.844]  Okay, WisconsinGunOwners.org, folks.
[02:01:59.984 --> 02:02:00.464]  Visit it.
[02:02:00.484 --> 02:02:01.224]  Give them support.
[02:02:01.244 --> 02:02:02.625]  But this is going on everywhere.
[02:02:02.985 --> 02:02:05.506]  You're just hearing about it because they're standing up against it.
[02:02:05.746 --> 02:02:08.707]  And I hope there are lawsuits against these people.
[02:02:09.067 --> 02:02:10.468]  They are the revolutionaries.
[02:02:10.688 --> 02:02:11.909]  They are the seditionists.
[02:02:12.329 --> 02:02:12.669]  They
[02:02:13.602 --> 02:02:18.683]  Ladies and gentlemen are a greater threat than Al-Qaeda, because Al-Qaeda can't come take my guns.
[02:02:19.324 --> 02:02:21.264]  And I can fight Al-Qaeda with my guns.
[02:02:21.744 --> 02:02:22.884]  I appreciate you coming on, sir.
[02:02:22.904 --> 02:02:23.965]  Alright, thanks a lot.
[02:02:24.025 --> 02:02:24.405]  God bless.
[02:02:24.545 --> 02:02:25.045]  Take care.
[02:02:25.145 --> 02:02:25.545]  Alright.
[02:02:26.605 --> 02:02:26.966]  They are!
[02:02:27.026 --> 02:02:33.287]  I'm telling you, this tyranny, this out-of-control system... Well, the government runs Al-Qaeda, so hence it is a greater threat than Al-Qaeda.
[02:02:33.327 --> 02:02:34.467]  It's the master of Al-Qaeda.
[02:02:34.507 --> 02:02:36.408]  It's the hen that laid the egg that is Al-Qaeda.
[02:02:38.008 --> 02:02:38.528]  We'll come back.
[02:02:38.569 --> 02:02:40.189]  We'll take your calls immediately.
[02:02:41.296 --> 02:02:43.293]  And cover news, PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:02:48.061 --> 02:02:53.546]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:53.966 --> 02:02:58.209]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:02:58.450 --> 02:03:05.475]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:05.856 --> 02:03:11.981]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:12.121 --> 02:03:13.322]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:13.662 --> 02:03:16.603]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:03:16.763 --> 02:03:18.784]  Eliminate the cost, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:03:19.084 --> 02:03:26.326]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[02:04:44.120 --> 02:04:48.442]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:04:48.642 --> 02:04:53.065]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:04:53.205 --> 02:04:57.607]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:04:57.627 --> 02:04:58.968]  The New World Order.
[02:04:59.748 --> 02:05:01.149]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:05:29.428 --> 02:05:33.989]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:34.009 --> 02:05:36.009]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:58.584 --> 02:06:01.106]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central.
[02:06:02.187 --> 02:06:04.429]  Back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:06:04.489 --> 02:06:05.630]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:06:06.170 --> 02:06:09.933]  Let's go directly to your calls you've been patiently holding, and I appreciate that.
[02:06:10.474 --> 02:06:11.534]  William in Oregon.
[02:06:11.595 --> 02:06:12.555]  William, you're on the air.
[02:06:12.615 --> 02:06:13.076]  Go ahead.
[02:06:13.816 --> 02:06:15.057]  Well, Alex, a couple things.
[02:06:15.117 --> 02:06:18.660]  First, I want to thank you for putting 9-11 Road to Tierney together.
[02:06:18.800 --> 02:06:21.703]  My mother, who's 76 years old, I sent her a copy of that.
[02:06:21.743 --> 02:06:23.344]  She's been a right winger her whole life.
[02:06:24.403 --> 02:06:27.645]  She had a big-time epiphany, so I want to thank you there, because she's woken up.
[02:06:27.705 --> 02:06:30.706]  So now what would she call herself if she was a big-time right-winger?
[02:06:31.927 --> 02:06:33.707]  I think she's an awareness factor right now.
[02:06:33.748 --> 02:06:42.112]  She's been going all over her condo complex and showing this tape to her friends, and I don't know what the result's going to be, but everybody there is probably 60 to 90 years old, and I think she's having a lot of fun with this.
[02:06:42.152 --> 02:06:45.093]  Well, I would say that she's now a real conservative.
[02:06:45.832 --> 02:06:47.512]  Or a real freedom lover.
[02:06:47.993 --> 02:06:49.813]  Because I know what gets her.
[02:06:50.313 --> 02:06:51.954]  I know why this wakes up conservatives.
[02:06:52.094 --> 02:06:55.134]  Because we show Bill Clinton blow up Oklahoma first, don't we?
[02:06:55.334 --> 02:06:55.574]  Yeah.
[02:06:55.654 --> 02:06:57.655]  And then we show George Bush in 9-11.
[02:06:58.255 --> 02:07:00.395]  We show people that it's not left-right.
[02:07:00.435 --> 02:07:00.816]  Go ahead.
[02:07:01.116 --> 02:07:09.918]  Well, another point I want to bring up, Joe, you're probably aware of this, I'm sure, but I want to tell all the listeners that may not be aware to kind of coordinate your thoughts on the globalists, what they're doing.
[02:07:09.958 --> 02:07:15.059]  I was really shocked a year or two ago when I found out where Al Jazeera actually broadcasts from.
[02:07:15.709 --> 02:07:31.374]  And it just goes to show, as you would say, the good cop, bad cop, how... I mean, it'd be like if CNN... I'm not going to give an analogy for this, but for people who don't know, Al Jazeera is broadcast in a little, small, teeny-weeny country called Qatar, which is basically a military outpost for the United States, in all essence.
[02:07:31.814 --> 02:07:36.116]  Yeah, and then they have little fake fights, like, we're going to take down the Al Jazeera banner.
[02:07:36.336 --> 02:07:38.237]  Ooh, they're letting those evil Arabs know.
[02:07:38.257 --> 02:07:38.457]  Right.
[02:07:38.897 --> 02:07:42.118]  And it is a known CIA front, folks.
[02:07:42.951 --> 02:07:49.635]  And then, oh, it's the people we can trust, and then they inflame the Arabs and play the games, and yeah, Qatar is a globalist base.
[02:07:49.675 --> 02:07:50.956]  The whole thing's a military base.
[02:07:51.196 --> 02:08:07.685]  It's just a way to have the class of civilizations which they want to create, and so you've got the Muslims upset with Al Jazeera, Pradhan Malani, you'll have CNN and our networks in the United States that get the Christian side of the... It's like the same people... Look, Rupert Murdoch's news in Europe bashes... This is important.
[02:08:08.105 --> 02:08:11.407]  Rupert Murdoch's news in Europe bashes America,
[02:08:12.202 --> 02:08:18.107]  Says we're New World Order, talks about 9-11, but that's for their audience over here.
[02:08:18.287 --> 02:08:21.370]  The war's good, patriotic, la la la.
[02:08:21.951 --> 02:08:22.931]  And it's the same thing.
[02:08:23.031 --> 02:08:24.553]  It's a fake paradigm.
[02:08:24.933 --> 02:08:26.154]  It's good cop, bad cop.
[02:08:26.174 --> 02:08:26.514]  Go ahead.
[02:08:26.775 --> 02:08:34.381]  And, well, also speaking of Murdoch, I happened to get a copy of Outfox.org, which I highly recommend people get and show their friends and spread it around.
[02:08:34.401 --> 02:08:35.162]  Yeah, what did you think of that?
[02:08:35.797 --> 02:08:36.698]  I was impressed.
[02:08:36.718 --> 02:08:41.421]  It was nice to see Walter Cronkite bashing him and realizing it's just basically a propaganda statement.
[02:08:41.581 --> 02:08:42.522]  There's the paradigm.
[02:08:42.762 --> 02:08:46.484]  Walter Cronkite is not as high level as you get at the Bohemian Grove.
[02:08:46.544 --> 02:08:51.848]  Right, I realize that, but nonetheless it gives some credibility to the fact that they're just a bunch of BS-ers.
[02:08:51.888 --> 02:08:56.471]  I was surprised to see Walter on here, to be honest with you, because I'm aware of his relationship with the BGC.
[02:08:57.552 --> 02:08:58.092]  Just amazing.
[02:08:58.112 --> 02:09:01.955]  But I think you're back in more of the stuff you've been talking about past hour about the police and whatnot.
[02:09:02.035 --> 02:09:04.917]  Also, you've probably seen this video, too, called Obstruction of Justice.
[02:09:05.771 --> 02:09:08.232]  About the two boys that were murdered in Arkansas?
[02:09:08.252 --> 02:09:09.512]  Yes, in Arkansas.
[02:09:09.652 --> 02:09:16.133]  Yeah, and that is so explicit in terms of the cover-up going up to the assassination of Barry Thiel and Kerry.
[02:09:16.153 --> 02:09:18.394]  You know, all these guys, Clinton, are all involved in this stuff.
[02:09:19.054 --> 02:09:26.615]  And for people who want to get even more education, I would have all your videos, but these are some other ones I have, and I just want to encourage people to look out for that other video.
[02:09:26.635 --> 02:09:27.956]  It's called Obstruction of Justice.
[02:09:28.676 --> 02:09:30.056]  Outfoxed is pretty darn good.
[02:09:30.096 --> 02:09:34.217]  I think they could have gone a little bit heavier into it, but it basically shows who these people are.
[02:09:34.710 --> 02:09:43.515]  Now, for people that are concerned about the planet, as we all are, especially you, I've really tuned into the gentleman who you interviewed, Colonel Don Dupre, I believe was his name.
[02:09:43.575 --> 02:09:43.835]  Yes.
[02:09:44.215 --> 02:09:59.062]  What are the odds of somebody like him putting together his own coalition of military and ex-military and educate these kids that are being indoctrinated and say, hey folks, it's time that we take back our country from those that are controlling it so deeply and so strongly and so, you know, luciferian, if you will.
[02:10:00.430 --> 02:10:07.915]  You know, I would think that a gentleman like that that has some pull and power and know and people, you know, are like-minded like him are going to stand up and be true patriots for all of us.
[02:10:08.716 --> 02:10:09.797]  That's what it's going to have to take.
[02:10:09.877 --> 02:10:11.478]  Otherwise, as you say, you know, this...
[02:10:12.245 --> 02:10:17.011]  Issues with the police state in terms of the way they're treating people, the DNC inside this cage, basically.
[02:10:17.031 --> 02:10:19.454]  You know, it might be a World Wrestling Federation or something.
[02:10:19.494 --> 02:10:20.335]  It's going to intimidate everybody.
[02:10:20.355 --> 02:10:21.195]  That's what it looks like.
[02:10:21.236 --> 02:10:27.122]  So your mom is running around, waking up to the New World Order, waking people up in her apartment complex.
[02:10:27.302 --> 02:10:27.943]  Oh, big time.
[02:10:28.003 --> 02:10:32.729]  And she was up in Seattle visiting some relatives and those little get-together up there for Father's Day.
[02:10:34.309 --> 02:10:37.950]  My aunts and uncles, my cousins, also my mom started loading all this stuff on.
[02:10:37.990 --> 02:10:39.650]  They did a double take on her.
[02:10:40.351 --> 02:10:41.211]  It's just amazing.
[02:10:41.351 --> 02:10:42.411]  It's really pleasing.
[02:10:42.451 --> 02:10:45.832]  I just want to thank you because I've been talking to her for, Christ, thirty years.
[02:10:46.072 --> 02:10:46.612]  Hey, listen.
[02:10:47.472 --> 02:10:48.953]  William, you've got this backwards.
[02:10:49.593 --> 02:10:51.213]  I want to thank you for getting the film.
[02:10:51.233 --> 02:10:52.894]  I want to thank you for giving it to your mother.
[02:10:53.914 --> 02:10:57.875]  Well, I'm the guy that called you a while back trying to put on this public thing with my buddy here in Oregon.
[02:10:57.895 --> 02:11:00.315]  He's been sick as hell, but he's back on his feet now.
[02:11:00.355 --> 02:11:02.476]  He's doing a video today about some other issue in the community.
[02:11:03.123 --> 02:11:07.026]  I'm going to get together with Jeffrey and we're going to do our best to get going and get this on public access.
[02:11:07.106 --> 02:11:08.527]  All your videos, whatever else I can put on there.
[02:11:08.547 --> 02:11:10.589]  Before they shut it down, they're shutting it down everywhere.
[02:11:10.649 --> 02:11:11.309]  Thanks for the call.
[02:11:12.350 --> 02:11:14.872]  And when they shut it down, watch out, they're not going to say they're doing it.
[02:11:15.032 --> 02:11:16.353]  Oh, we're reorganizing it.
[02:11:17.411 --> 02:11:20.932]  Let's go ahead and go to Marty in California.
[02:11:20.992 --> 02:11:21.793]  Marty, go ahead.
[02:11:22.173 --> 02:11:23.053]  Hello, Alex.
[02:11:23.173 --> 02:11:24.313]  I appreciate your work, sir.
[02:11:24.333 --> 02:11:24.934]  I respect you a lot.
[02:11:25.114 --> 02:11:25.734]  Well, thank you.
[02:11:25.754 --> 02:11:28.295]  Again, you got this backwards.
[02:11:28.335 --> 02:11:28.735]  Thank you.
[02:11:29.515 --> 02:11:35.537]  I heard on the radio last night that the National Rifle Association is funding a liberal Democrat candidate.
[02:11:35.857 --> 02:11:37.038]  He's a congressman, actually.
[02:11:37.078 --> 02:11:37.678]  Joe Baca?
[02:11:37.978 --> 02:11:38.478]  Yes, they are.
[02:11:38.778 --> 02:11:43.600]  And he's the one that demanded a halt to the immigration sweeps a couple weeks ago.
[02:11:44.443 --> 02:11:51.147]  Well, the NRA tried to get a $47 billion land grab package passed to grab people's farms and ranches.
[02:11:51.207 --> 02:11:54.169]  The NRA argued in federal court last year in D.C.
[02:11:54.729 --> 02:11:59.912]  that the Second Amendment means you cannot take your gun out of your house if they are for total gun registration.
[02:11:59.932 --> 02:12:00.872]  That's word for word.
[02:12:01.193 --> 02:12:06.496]  The NRA, from Illinois to Texas, actually tries to frustrate us when we're trying to defeat gun bills.
[02:12:06.856 --> 02:12:07.957]  They're a Trojan horse!
[02:12:08.257 --> 02:12:10.258]  And people... I don't mean the members, folks!
[02:12:10.948 --> 02:12:12.409]  Again, it's like when I criticize the U.S.
[02:12:12.449 --> 02:12:15.552]  or Israel or China, I'm not criticizing the people.
[02:12:16.112 --> 02:12:18.374]  I'm criticizing, you know, the infiltrators.
[02:12:19.135 --> 02:12:28.202]  Well, you know, gun owners are some of the biggest supporters of Prop 187, which would have stopped the benefits for aliens, and they have no idea what the NRA is up to.
[02:12:28.502 --> 02:12:29.062]  They really don't.
[02:12:29.283 --> 02:12:30.884]  Well, they're not going to find out unless we tell them.
[02:12:30.924 --> 02:12:31.324]  Good point.
[02:12:31.344 --> 02:12:31.845]  Anything else?
[02:12:32.405 --> 02:12:33.666]  Yeah, did you see this article?
[02:12:33.746 --> 02:12:34.226]  I'm sure you did.
[02:12:34.447 --> 02:12:37.109]  Potential terrorists released for lack of jail space.
[02:12:37.269 --> 02:12:37.909]  I printed it out.
[02:12:37.929 --> 02:12:39.210]  I'm showing it to everybody I know.
[02:12:39.250 --> 02:12:39.811]  Did you see this?
[02:12:40.900 --> 02:12:41.701]  Which one is that?
[02:12:41.981 --> 02:12:44.123]  It's out of the Brownsfield Herald in Texas.
[02:12:44.223 --> 02:12:53.530]  It says that Congressman Culberson and Ortiz admit that Middle Easterners are caught sneaking across Mexico and then released on their own recognizance.
[02:12:53.770 --> 02:12:54.371]  I didn't see it.
[02:12:54.391 --> 02:12:55.392]  Will you please email it?
[02:12:55.772 --> 02:12:57.013]  Oh, it's amazing.
[02:12:57.073 --> 02:12:58.414]  Potential terrorist release.
[02:12:58.634 --> 02:13:00.236]  Tips at Infowars.com.
[02:13:00.256 --> 02:13:01.056]  Thanks for the call.
[02:13:01.457 --> 02:13:02.397]  That is so classic.
[02:13:02.437 --> 02:13:03.518]  Well, I was aware of that.
[02:13:04.999 --> 02:13:08.062]  And there are real Muslim terrorist folks.
[02:13:08.915 --> 02:13:17.019]  You know, they had an attempted hijacking after 9-11 in New Mexico and they told the people to shut up about it.
[02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:25.364]  There are real groups that aren't CIA controlled, but the big events, NORAD standing down, four jets flying around, that's the government.
[02:13:26.744 --> 02:13:29.846]  Let's go ahead and, yeah, I mean the southern border, the northern border.
[02:13:30.846 --> 02:13:35.889]  Folks, there are 8,000 border patrols for the entire southern border.
[02:13:36.741 --> 02:13:39.809]  There are only a few hundred on at any one time on the northern border.
[02:13:40.511 --> 02:13:42.215]  But 8,000 to the southern border.
[02:13:42.901 --> 02:13:46.882]  A little over what they say, $1,200, $1,300 at any one time on the southern border.
[02:13:47.122 --> 02:13:48.542]  A few hundred for the northern border.
[02:13:48.822 --> 02:13:57.124]  But they are going to put cameras up in your neighborhood and merge your police with the National Guard and interrogate your children about what's in the medicine cabinet.
[02:13:57.144 --> 02:13:58.784]  Do you ever get spankings?
[02:14:00.404 --> 02:14:01.885]  What type of guns do you have?
[02:14:01.905 --> 02:14:03.865]  Let me show you the guns that are illegal.
[02:14:04.185 --> 02:14:05.145]  Here's your tattletale.
[02:14:05.365 --> 02:14:06.586]  I'm not kidding, folks!
[02:14:07.726 --> 02:14:09.006]  I mean, this is a joke!
[02:14:09.798 --> 02:14:13.799]  We're gonna put people in a cage, inside a cage, and aim M60s at them!
[02:14:14.339 --> 02:14:15.500]  Because they're protesting!
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:17.741]  You're allowed to protest, but not outside this box!
[02:14:18.281 --> 02:14:19.601]  America is no longer free!
[02:14:19.621 --> 02:14:22.002]  Uh, let's talk to Jonathan.
[02:14:22.682 --> 02:14:24.543]  Jonathan, you're calling us from where?
[02:14:25.463 --> 02:14:26.923]  It's, uh, Yonkers, New York.
[02:14:27.223 --> 02:14:27.904]  Welcome, sir!
[02:14:28.244 --> 02:14:28.864]  Hey, how you doin'?
[02:14:28.924 --> 02:14:31.465]  I just wanna, uh, cover the issue of the privacy.
[02:14:32.825 --> 02:14:33.125]  Okay.
[02:14:33.385 --> 02:14:38.287]  There's a couple of things that, that have happened to, especially me, the last month.
[02:14:39.045 --> 02:14:47.409]  That, uh, it was, uh, I live in Yonkers, New York, New York City, and, um, it was about Roblox.
[02:14:47.709 --> 02:15:01.036]  They started, when they pulled, uh, pulled, they were basically pulling everybody over, but it was, uh, us especially, since we, uh, had a magazine, Utene, it was, it's an underground magazine, you know of it?
[02:15:02.396 --> 02:15:02.936]  What's it called?
[02:15:03.357 --> 02:15:03.677]  Utene.
[02:15:04.257 --> 02:15:04.717]  No, I don't.
[02:15:05.037 --> 02:15:06.058]  It's, uh, from Europe.
[02:15:06.619 --> 02:15:14.984]  And just because of that, that contraband, they let us go, but they said they sent one cop to follow specifically us.
[02:15:17.386 --> 02:15:18.786]  Let me stop you.
[02:15:18.927 --> 02:15:20.648]  Have you seen my video, The Road to Journey?
[02:15:20.868 --> 02:15:21.248]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:15:22.062 --> 02:15:46.961]  I've seen it in the... To show the police being trained that the Constitution's evil, the Founding Fathers are evil, but then we don't just show the classroom, we show the checkpoint, the woman, no criminal record, they find a pocket Constitution, they find a Harrison Ford video, just because they have the name Patriot, and one of my videos, so they go ahead and arrest her, and then have a discussion on the road, via their microphones and video, is this legal?
[02:15:47.001 --> 02:15:48.182]  But they weren't sure!
[02:15:48.971 --> 02:16:00.260]  And so, now they have these seatbelt checks or driver's license checks where you're all guilty until proven innocent, and then if they find anything, well that's European letters, that might be terrorists, that's a weird name!
[02:16:00.841 --> 02:16:03.062]  So they questioned you about it, did they?
[02:16:03.363 --> 02:16:05.885]  Yeah, well, they pulled us over again, that's the thing.
[02:16:05.905 --> 02:16:11.069]  They questioned us about what we were doing here, because since we live
[02:16:11.559 --> 02:16:14.000]  About five or six miles from that town.
[02:16:14.380 --> 02:16:16.680]  Yeah, why were you in another town?
[02:16:16.780 --> 02:16:17.401]  Oh my!
[02:16:17.741 --> 02:16:18.761]  Oh, Al-Qaeda!
[02:16:19.501 --> 02:16:20.942]  Why was I in another town?
[02:16:21.002 --> 02:16:28.524]  Why was, uh... You know, especially because me and my brother were driving, and we were Hispanic.
[02:16:29.004 --> 02:16:33.905]  And we, uh... I don't know what they found against us, but they kept following us.
[02:16:34.025 --> 02:16:34.926]  You mean you're Hispanic?
[02:16:35.026 --> 02:16:35.226]  Yeah.
[02:16:36.366 --> 02:16:37.226]  Yeah, me and my brother.
[02:16:37.266 --> 02:16:40.047]  You know, anybody that's... This is how it always works.
[02:16:40.862 --> 02:16:42.824]  The minority group gets targeted.
[02:16:43.124 --> 02:16:46.707]  It's like Bill Clinton with warrantless searches for guns in the inner cities.
[02:16:47.127 --> 02:16:52.952]  Oh, that was okay, you know, because some racist out there, but now that it's happening to white America, they don't like it.
[02:16:53.272 --> 02:16:55.374]  So they always test it out on you first.
[02:16:56.154 --> 02:17:01.438]  And that's why I've got Hispanic friends that go, why do you have giant American flags and stuff?
[02:17:01.658 --> 02:17:04.100]  I mean, nothing against the American flag, but why suddenly?
[02:17:04.561 --> 02:17:07.183]  Oh, because I'm brown and I get left alone.
[02:17:07.873 --> 02:17:09.174]  Yeah.
[02:17:09.474 --> 02:17:10.155]  It's a joke!
[02:17:10.195 --> 02:17:12.136]  They're no real... Where are the terrorists?
[02:17:12.156 --> 02:17:15.059]  I mean, if you put the borders open, they're letting all the Muslims in.
[02:17:15.819 --> 02:17:16.079]  Yeah.
[02:17:16.280 --> 02:17:17.441]  It's just... it's sick!
[02:17:18.241 --> 02:17:18.521]  Yeah.
[02:17:18.802 --> 02:17:19.983]  So why wasn't that exciting to you?
[02:17:20.003 --> 02:17:21.664]  Did you say, I mean, what's your problem?
[02:17:21.804 --> 02:17:24.186]  Alright, the problem that... I didn't mind that.
[02:17:24.246 --> 02:17:27.628]  That happens, you know, that happens to anybody, but my problem is... Well, you should mind it!
[02:17:27.668 --> 02:17:33.153]  Yeah, they... the thing that bothered me was that they asked me for my house address.
[02:17:34.804 --> 02:17:35.726]  Stay there, stay there.
[02:17:35.746 --> 02:17:37.228]  We'll talk about it more on the other side.
[02:17:37.788 --> 02:17:41.253]  We'll go to Daryl, Paul, and many many others.
[02:17:41.433 --> 02:17:43.756]  PrisonPlanet.TV folks, check it out.
[02:17:45.959 --> 02:17:47.560]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:17:47.720 --> 02:17:51.804]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:17:51.944 --> 02:17:54.846]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:17:54.906 --> 02:18:01.632]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:18:01.812 --> 02:18:04.834]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:18:05.035 --> 02:18:07.416]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:18:07.557 --> 02:18:15.443]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[02:18:15.603 --> 02:18:27.012]  Atkazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.

[02:18:46.474 --> 02:18:48.675]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[02:18:49.115 --> 02:18:53.458]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[02:18:53.738 --> 02:18:59.561]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[02:18:59.781 --> 02:19:03.823]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[02:19:04.123 --> 02:19:09.766]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[02:19:09.886 --> 02:19:12.487]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[02:19:14.588 --> 02:19:18.489]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[02:19:18.529 --> 02:19:20.909]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[02:19:21.249 --> 02:19:23.550]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[02:19:23.930 --> 02:19:27.551]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[02:19:28.031 --> 02:19:34.232]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[02:19:34.672 --> 02:19:35.672]  You'll be glad you did.
[02:19:36.012 --> 02:19:36.433]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:36.473 --> 02:19:36.713]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.555 --> 02:19:52.737]  In your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap, chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc., read the labels.
[02:19:53.157 --> 02:19:57.279]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:19:57.499 --> 02:20:01.680]  Also, may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:20:02.060 --> 02:20:06.942]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:20:07.322 --> 02:20:10.924]  Now, just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:20:11.104 --> 02:20:16.448]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:20:16.708 --> 02:20:19.449]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:20:19.750 --> 02:20:20.650]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:20:20.950 --> 02:20:31.677]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[02:20:45.006 --> 02:20:49.368]  Most of us have had a cafe we frequented because the service was so wonderful or the food was so great.
[02:20:49.528 --> 02:20:56.590]  The Silver Bear Cafe understands this philosophy and has incorporated these ideals into a website that offers food for thought to nourish the mind.
[02:20:56.870 --> 02:21:03.773]  Membership in the bear consists of a large and growing group of patriots who, like you, realize there are things in this great country that need changing right away.
[02:21:04.093 --> 02:21:11.578]  The Silver Bear Cafe provides you with an income opportunity that will provide you and your family with an ongoing revenue stream in return for simply spreading the message.
[02:21:11.978 --> 02:21:17.922]  So many of you have been trying to get the message out individually, but collectively our voices are strong and cannot be silenced.
[02:21:18.362 --> 02:21:21.004]  Membership in the bear will teach you the secrets of financial freedom.
[02:21:21.344 --> 02:21:23.545]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[02:21:52.711 --> 02:21:55.072]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:56.313 --> 02:21:58.014]  Waging war on corruption!
[02:21:58.034 --> 02:22:03.898]  Doesn't matter if you're black or white, old or young, German, Chinese.
[02:22:05.398 --> 02:22:09.861]  Doesn't matter if you're from Venezuela or Quebec, Canada.
[02:22:09.921 --> 02:22:12.963]  The New World Order wants to enslave you.
[02:22:13.003 --> 02:22:15.324]  They want to put cancer viruses in your vaccines.
[02:22:15.664 --> 02:22:17.245]  They want to kill 80% of you.
[02:22:17.445 --> 02:22:18.306]  They want control.
[02:22:18.646 --> 02:22:19.647]  Stop denying it!
[02:22:19.907 --> 02:22:21.728]  They're setting up the grid to do it.
[02:22:23.072 --> 02:22:24.632]  They're a bunch of control freaks.
[02:22:25.953 --> 02:22:33.455]  We're talking to Jonathan in New York, and we'll go to Daryl, Paul, and Melissa, and Steve, and many others.
[02:22:33.495 --> 02:22:42.978]  But finishing up, so you're driving along in your car with your brother, they pull you over once, ask you about a magazine, follow you into your house, or pull you over again and want to know where you live.
[02:22:43.678 --> 02:22:45.039]  Describe to us what happened.
[02:22:45.439 --> 02:22:48.079]  Alright, it started a second time.
[02:22:48.119 --> 02:22:49.700]  He said, I'm pulling you over again because
[02:22:50.560 --> 02:22:57.786]  We're just, uh, it's just, you know, random text, but... And he said, uh... So there's such freedom that you got pulled over twice?
[02:22:58.366 --> 02:22:58.866]  Yeah.
[02:22:58.907 --> 02:23:00.608]  Was it the same Lord?
[02:23:00.648 --> 02:23:01.609]  Was it the same God?
[02:23:01.629 --> 02:23:06.352]  No, it was, uh, it was, uh, his, uh, probably his chief told him to follow us.
[02:23:06.693 --> 02:23:10.756]  I don't know why, but... Okay, he pulls you over again, and then what happened?
[02:23:10.956 --> 02:23:11.696]  He pulls me over.
[02:23:11.756 --> 02:23:13.998]  He said, uh, can you step out of the car right now?
[02:23:14.018 --> 02:23:18.842]  Just, uh, you know, just, uh, confirm your identity or some... I don't know.
[02:23:19.469 --> 02:23:23.832]  Anyway, he said, um, mind if we check your glove compartment?
[02:23:24.373 --> 02:23:27.555]  And, uh, you know, just to check if you have any contraband or anything.
[02:23:27.655 --> 02:23:29.776]  And you should have said no, it's called the Fourth Amendment.
[02:23:29.996 --> 02:23:31.357]  Why are you pulling me over?
[02:23:31.497 --> 02:23:33.099]  How would you like somebody doing this to you?
[02:23:33.399 --> 02:23:35.340]  We don't, we didn't even have the choice to say no.
[02:23:35.360 --> 02:23:37.262]  He just stepped right in like it was his car.
[02:23:38.042 --> 02:23:38.983]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[02:23:39.343 --> 02:23:42.285]  Yeah, because... Hey, you'll put up with it, you're... Hey, we always said this.
[02:23:42.845 --> 02:23:44.126]  You'll say, what do you have to hide?
[02:23:44.166 --> 02:23:45.027]  Lettuce in your car.
[02:23:45.307 --> 02:23:46.928]  Well, then, what do you have to hide?
[02:23:46.968 --> 02:23:47.769]  Lettuce in your house.
[02:23:48.599 --> 02:23:50.380]  But now they're going to do it to our houses!
[02:23:50.480 --> 02:23:51.621]  Just checkpoints!
[02:23:51.661 --> 02:23:52.901]  We're searching all the houses!
[02:23:52.961 --> 02:23:53.542]  Part of the freedom!
[02:23:53.782 --> 02:23:54.923]  And so then what happened next?
[02:23:55.083 --> 02:23:57.744]  Yeah, then I proceeded to say, you know, you're violating my right.
[02:23:58.304 --> 02:23:59.685]  And, you know, you can't do this.
[02:23:59.825 --> 02:24:02.467]  And he said, well, you don't got to be talking about that.
[02:24:02.527 --> 02:24:04.368]  You don't know anything about the right.
[02:24:04.408 --> 02:24:05.208]  You're not an American.
[02:24:05.808 --> 02:24:09.290]  And that's the type of thing that bothers me.
[02:24:11.814 --> 02:24:14.816]  You sound like you've been in America forever.
[02:24:14.896 --> 02:24:15.696]  I mean, it doesn't matter.
[02:24:15.776 --> 02:24:17.998]  You have rights as a citizen, as a human being.
[02:24:18.158 --> 02:24:20.580]  Yeah, I mean, like, I don't know what he saw.
[02:24:20.820 --> 02:24:24.563]  Oh, well, by the way, yeah, I forgot to mention, I was also carrying your video.
[02:24:24.963 --> 02:24:28.585]  I don't know if they saw that, the Road to Tyranny 9-11.
[02:24:28.686 --> 02:24:32.909]  I don't know if they saw that, but I don't... I just can't explain it.
[02:24:33.169 --> 02:24:33.509]  They just...
[02:24:34.133 --> 02:24:34.953]  Kept insisting.
[02:24:35.073 --> 02:24:38.314]  So, this first class citizen finally let you go?
[02:24:38.334 --> 02:24:47.336]  Yeah, he finally let me go after he said, uh, you know, boy, alright, you're alright, but, uh, you know, just, uh, be careful and don't talk back to any of us.
[02:24:47.836 --> 02:24:51.977]  Yeah, like if I was like a third class citizen, like... Yeah, I know, it's like Russia!
[02:24:52.037 --> 02:24:53.918]  Exactly, you gotta learn to lick my boots!
[02:24:54.298 --> 02:24:59.679]  And again, a lot of cops are great, but more and more it's these thugs, I don't know, what happened to their brains, thanks for the call.
[02:25:00.019 --> 02:25:02.180]  They're trying to encourage them to act like this.
[02:25:03.374 --> 02:25:04.335]  It is disgusting!
[02:25:05.395 --> 02:25:08.177]  I mean, and again, I mean, how would you like being treated like this?
[02:25:10.118 --> 02:25:10.698]  You know what?
[02:25:10.718 --> 02:25:15.240]  Cops are going to be old grandpas wishing their grandchildren weren't slaves, and nobody's going to be there for you.
[02:25:15.801 --> 02:25:17.281]  Just, what are you doing to us?
[02:25:18.262 --> 02:25:19.683]  Daryl in Pennsylvania.
[02:25:19.723 --> 02:25:20.663]  Daryl, go ahead.
[02:25:21.063 --> 02:25:29.988]  Yeah, Alex, your three police state videos really do a great job of covering the Fourth Amendment violations that we have gone on in this country.
[02:25:30.615 --> 02:25:37.879]  And I really would urge all the listeners who don't have those tapes to get them and share them with their local law enforcement, their local police.
[02:25:38.100 --> 02:25:42.902]  And can I read two quick, short quotes that really tie in nicely with the interview you just had?
[02:25:43.063 --> 02:25:43.343]  Okay.
[02:25:43.603 --> 02:25:50.247]  The first one's by William Pitt, and he was an English statesman, gave this speech in the House of Commons in 1763.
[02:25:50.767 --> 02:25:52.969]  You might want to comment on these quotes, they're great.
[02:25:53.009 --> 02:25:58.452]  The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the forces of the crown, talking about the British crown,
[02:25:58.874 --> 02:26:08.221]  His cottage may be frail, its roof may shake, the wind may blow through it, the storm may enter, the rain may enter, but the King of England may not enter.
[02:26:08.441 --> 02:26:12.844]  All his force dares not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement.
[02:26:13.324 --> 02:26:20.069]  And that's where a lot of our founding fathers, Alex, got their love for the right of property to be protected.
[02:26:20.109 --> 02:26:23.351]  The next quote is John Adams, second president of the United States.
[02:26:23.431 --> 02:26:25.793]  The moment the idea is admitted into society,
[02:26:26.178 --> 02:26:26.758]  That's right.
[02:26:38.345 --> 02:27:02.237]  Well, their attitude is, we're American police, former military, we're fighting the war on crime, and we don't care because we're going to get rid of the Bill of Rights, and they have all these weird little rulings like, well, we're allowed to put you in a cage inside a cage to protest, and no one can see you or talk to you.
[02:27:02.277 --> 02:27:02.858]  That's freedom.
[02:27:02.958 --> 02:27:03.438]  Shut up!
[02:27:04.167 --> 02:27:15.336]  You were the one that really got me going to do a newsletter on this subject when you had mentioned about that Federal Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that police didn't need a warrant, you know, to come into your house.
[02:27:16.436 --> 02:27:19.118]  So, anyway, God bless you, Alex, and thanks for all you do.
[02:27:19.539 --> 02:27:20.139]  Hey, thank you.
[02:27:20.179 --> 02:27:21.100]  Send me a copy of that.
[02:27:21.140 --> 02:27:21.660]  That's interesting.
[02:27:21.700 --> 02:27:23.402]  Yeah, I was familiar with Pitt's quote.
[02:27:24.543 --> 02:27:26.624]  Yeah, I mean, a man's home is a castle.
[02:27:26.704 --> 02:27:27.465]  Ever heard that?
[02:27:27.865 --> 02:27:29.486]  I think some of you may remember that.
[02:27:30.287 --> 02:27:30.987]  Not anymore.
[02:27:31.027 --> 02:27:32.789]  A man's home is his sleep pit.
[02:27:35.965 --> 02:27:38.966]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.986 --> 02:27:42.687]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.608 --> 02:27:51.909]  Just once I'd like to clean my car's leather upholstery without sliding across the seat on every turn.
[02:27:52.609 --> 02:27:56.990]  Just once I'd like to get a beautiful shine without a slick oily resin that attracts dust and dirt.
[02:27:57.590 --> 02:28:00.591]  Introducing just once the amazing non-slip protectant.
[02:28:01.224 --> 02:28:05.328]  Just Once cleans, protects, and shines vinyl, leather, rubber, and hard plastics.
[02:28:05.809 --> 02:28:14.037]  Its patented formula eliminates slippery surfaces, provides optimum UV protection against the sun's harmful rays, and outlasts those other less effective formulas.
[02:28:14.638 --> 02:28:19.422]  Just Once is excellent for use on cars, trucks, motorcycles, boats, truck bedliners, and RVs.
[02:28:20.283 --> 02:28:30.305]  You can use it on dashboard, leather and vinyl interiors, motorcycle seats and tires, floor mats, convertible tops, brake pedals or anywhere you need ultimate protection, including leather furniture, shoes and purses.
[02:28:30.865 --> 02:28:34.466]  Just Once has been used commercially nationwide and now it's available to you.
[02:28:35.086 --> 02:28:41.648]  To order, call 888-578-6623 or visit JustOnce.com on the World Wide Web.
[02:28:42.008 --> 02:28:43.588]  That's JustOnce.com.
[02:28:45.402 --> 02:28:47.363]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[02:28:47.443 --> 02:28:58.168]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:28:58.548 --> 02:29:03.070]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:29:03.130 --> 02:29:14.475]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:29:15.055 --> 02:29:21.900]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:29:22.301 --> 02:29:24.442]  Your purified water is now ready!
[02:29:24.923 --> 02:29:29.907]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[02:29:30.207 --> 02:29:36.351]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:36.372 --> 02:29:37.492]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:29:37.532 --> 02:29:38.413]  That's toll free.
[02:29:45.439 --> 02:29:47.140]  I'm taking collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:29:47.220 --> 02:29:49.722]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[02:29:49.922 --> 02:29:50.603]  It feels great.
[02:29:50.803 --> 02:29:51.804]  Absolutely wonderful.
[02:29:51.924 --> 02:29:57.449]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:29:57.769 --> 02:29:59.291]  Kimberly, tell us about your success.
[02:29:59.551 --> 02:30:01.913]  Okay, I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[02:30:02.053 --> 02:30:05.156]  I've lost 16 pounds and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[02:30:05.336 --> 02:30:06.017]  Incredible.
[02:30:06.217 --> 02:30:07.439]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[02:30:07.479 --> 02:30:11.163]  I have a 21-month-old child and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[02:30:11.263 --> 02:30:12.064]  Well, that's for sure.
[02:30:12.224 --> 02:30:12.805]  Was it easy?
[02:30:13.045 --> 02:30:13.646]  Very easy.
[02:30:13.686 --> 02:30:14.567]  I mean, there's nothing to it.
[02:30:14.607 --> 02:30:19.752]  You can actually still continue to eat meals with your children and not starve yourself or anything else and lose weight.
[02:30:20.333 --> 02:30:26.258]  You can lose fat the safe and healthy way just like Kimberly did with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:30:26.598 --> 02:30:27.699]  Call right now 1-800-622-THIN.
[02:30:27.759 --> 02:30:28.140]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[02:30:28.160 --> 02:30:33.885]  Remember, imagine you heard it right here and that gets you $25 off a three-month supply.
[02:30:33.905 --> 02:30:35.106]  So call Vim and Vigor today 1-800-622-THIN.
[02:30:35.126 --> 02:30:35.726]  Again that's 1-800-622-8446.
[02:30:51.666 --> 02:31:04.917]  Alright folks, we're back live here.
[02:31:05.318 --> 02:31:08.601]  About 27, 26 minutes left.
[02:31:08.701 --> 02:31:10.202]  I want to get to some other news here in a moment.
[02:31:10.222 --> 02:31:13.585]  Let's finish up with at least the callers that have filled up the phone lines.
[02:31:14.835 --> 02:31:21.158]  Quickly as possible, but I do have to say that that's part of our Magna Carta 1214.
[02:31:22.698 --> 02:31:24.239]  It's part of the Mosaic Law.
[02:31:24.319 --> 02:31:26.980]  It's the Bill of Rights that grew out of that.
[02:31:27.921 --> 02:31:35.864]  A free human being, a person who was not a slave, could not have people come in their house without specifics, without a warrant.
[02:31:37.085 --> 02:31:38.326]  But not in the New America.
[02:31:38.386 --> 02:31:39.967]  They got all kinds of excuses.
[02:31:39.987 --> 02:31:40.947]  They're keeping you safe.
[02:31:40.987 --> 02:31:41.708]  They love you.
[02:31:41.748 --> 02:31:43.129]  They care so much about you.
[02:31:43.609 --> 02:31:44.730]  They got a private prison.
[02:31:44.750 --> 02:31:47.491]  They want to put you in because they want a slave because they love you.
[02:31:47.511 --> 02:31:49.973]  They care so much about you.
[02:31:51.540 --> 02:31:52.682]  And you think about the children.
[02:31:52.742 --> 02:31:54.524]  They're being taught all guns are illegal.
[02:31:55.024 --> 02:31:55.905]  They're being frisked.
[02:31:56.066 --> 02:31:56.886]  Drug dogs.
[02:31:57.167 --> 02:31:58.028]  Lockers searched.
[02:31:58.168 --> 02:31:59.129]  Bar bar fences.
[02:31:59.510 --> 02:32:01.131]  Thumbs scanning to get school lunches.
[02:32:01.512 --> 02:32:02.753]  Cameras in the classrooms.
[02:32:02.813 --> 02:32:04.235]  Hallways in some schools.
[02:32:04.736 --> 02:32:05.637]  Tennessee, New York.
[02:32:06.157 --> 02:32:07.359]  In the bathrooms.
[02:32:08.331 --> 02:32:08.992]  Uh, Michigan.
[02:32:09.432 --> 02:32:12.915]  Uh, rest stops have cameras in the bathroom scene.
[02:32:12.935 --> 02:32:13.476]  That's 1984.
[02:32:13.516 --> 02:32:18.000]  To somebody who read that 20 years ago, or 5 years ago, man, 1984 was bad.
[02:32:18.501 --> 02:32:20.402]  Cameras in the bathrooms, the ultimate tyranny.
[02:32:20.642 --> 02:32:22.004]  Now it's just like, yeah, we're putting them in.
[02:32:22.444 --> 02:32:23.885]  So, you can trust us to do this.
[02:32:24.746 --> 02:32:25.867]  You know, it's for safety.
[02:32:25.907 --> 02:32:28.570]  You're not, you're not for the, for the criminals, are you?
[02:32:29.811 --> 02:32:30.912]  So, this is the system.
[02:32:32.179 --> 02:32:33.119]  And it's double-think!
[02:32:33.219 --> 02:32:37.901]  You know, a janitor puts a camera in the school bathroom, he goes to jail for being a pervert, and he should!
[02:32:38.201 --> 02:32:41.121]  But the government does it officially, it's a good thing!
[02:32:43.162 --> 02:32:44.942]  And so, this is what it's come to now!
[02:32:45.582 --> 02:32:51.844]  And it's gonna get worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, because people don't know what it is to be an American anymore!
[02:32:52.164 --> 02:32:53.665]  They don't even know what it is to be free!
[02:32:53.705 --> 02:32:54.965]  They don't know what tyranny is!
[02:32:56.448 --> 02:33:00.132]  A lot of us do know, but see the government's going, just keep complaining.
[02:33:00.152 --> 02:33:01.774]  We're putting in electronic voting machines.
[02:33:01.794 --> 02:33:02.915]  We're taking your right to vote.
[02:33:03.436 --> 02:33:04.757]  We're going to have staged elections.
[02:33:05.858 --> 02:33:07.100]  We're arming the police.
[02:33:07.160 --> 02:33:08.501]  We're militarizing them.
[02:33:08.521 --> 02:33:09.622]  We're getting armored vehicles.
[02:33:09.662 --> 02:33:11.064]  We're training them that you're the enemy.
[02:33:11.484 --> 02:33:12.886]  We're training them that you're the slave.
[02:33:12.906 --> 02:33:16.390]  We're issuing them huge microwave guns mounted on armored vehicles.
[02:33:17.370 --> 02:33:18.611]  You know, we're going to let you know.
[02:33:18.671 --> 02:33:19.491]  The fun's coming.
[02:33:19.531 --> 02:33:20.172]  Just get ready.
[02:33:20.432 --> 02:33:20.852]  That's right.
[02:33:20.892 --> 02:33:22.013]  You just keep complaining.
[02:33:22.273 --> 02:33:23.994]  You notice we don't care what you say now.
[02:33:24.174 --> 02:33:24.914]  We're the boss.
[02:33:24.954 --> 02:33:26.055]  You better treat us right.
[02:33:26.255 --> 02:33:27.556]  We're going to take good care of you.
[02:33:27.576 --> 02:33:28.356]  We're the rulers.
[02:33:28.396 --> 02:33:29.057]  We're the boss.
[02:33:29.277 --> 02:33:30.377]  We're the authorities.
[02:33:30.898 --> 02:33:32.218]  We're the officials.
[02:33:32.258 --> 02:33:33.319]  We're not the servants.
[02:33:33.399 --> 02:33:34.640]  You're the civilians.
[02:33:35.920 --> 02:33:36.981]  Over and over again.
[02:33:37.161 --> 02:33:38.202]  You're the servant.
[02:33:38.302 --> 02:33:39.242]  You're the people.
[02:33:39.342 --> 02:33:40.483]  You do what we say.
[02:33:41.678 --> 02:33:49.575]  If we want to set up nine toll roads in Austin, Texas, where every major road's a toll road, existing roads, and we want to search your cars at checkpoints, we're gonna do it!
[02:33:50.583 --> 02:33:52.284]  We want to shut down your access TV?
[02:33:52.304 --> 02:33:52.984]  We're going to do it!
[02:33:53.565 --> 02:33:56.847]  We want to double the number of children grabbed in your town or city every year?
[02:33:56.867 --> 02:33:57.507]  We're going to do it!
[02:33:57.987 --> 02:33:59.568]  We want to put people in giant prisons?
[02:33:59.588 --> 02:34:00.269]  We're going to do it!
[02:34:00.529 --> 02:34:05.032]  We don't care if the Texas truancy law says 14 unexcused absences is criminal.
[02:34:05.372 --> 02:34:08.614]  If you miss class three times, if you're late three times, we consider that!
[02:34:08.854 --> 02:34:10.175]  We don't care if it's not a law!
[02:34:10.355 --> 02:34:12.976]  We'll trick you into signing a document to go on probation!
[02:34:13.136 --> 02:34:14.237]  And then we'll drug test you!
[02:34:14.377 --> 02:34:15.818]  And put you in juvenile hall!
[02:34:15.978 --> 02:34:17.339]  And then you'll learn how to be a criminal!
[02:34:17.619 --> 02:34:23.461]  They will put you in a private prison owned by drug dealers, owned by the people shipping in the cocaine and heroin.
[02:34:25.461 --> 02:34:26.842]  Now that's the facts, folks.
[02:34:28.202 --> 02:34:29.683]  And I sit here and I watch this.
[02:34:30.263 --> 02:34:31.503]  You want to go into bondage?
[02:34:31.563 --> 02:34:32.744]  That's the norm in history?
[02:34:33.064 --> 02:34:34.124]  It's now happening.
[02:34:36.665 --> 02:34:43.227]  It just disgusts me, totally disgusts me, to watch this happen to our country.
[02:34:45.976 --> 02:34:47.918]  Oh, up next is Melissa in Florida.
[02:34:47.938 --> 02:34:48.819]  Melissa, go ahead.
[02:34:52.622 --> 02:34:56.345]  Sounds like a cordless or a mobile having a problem.
[02:34:57.566 --> 02:34:58.387]  Okay, she's gone.
[02:34:58.447 --> 02:34:59.147]  Sorry, Melissa.
[02:34:59.648 --> 02:35:00.549]  Steve in Kansas.
[02:35:00.569 --> 02:35:01.369]  Steve, go ahead.
[02:35:03.531 --> 02:35:05.993]  Mr. Jones, thank you for everything you're doing.
[02:35:06.073 --> 02:35:06.674]  God bless you.
[02:35:06.734 --> 02:35:07.575]  Well, God bless you.
[02:35:07.635 --> 02:35:08.055]  Thank you.
[02:35:09.376 --> 02:35:10.617]  I do pass out your tapes.
[02:35:10.697 --> 02:35:11.638]  I've talked to you before.
[02:35:13.626 --> 02:35:29.313]  I hung on the line yesterday and these people that are watching the Democratic Convention, if they have so many demonstrators, why couldn't they make a bunch of signs saying, look at this?
[02:35:30.990 --> 02:35:33.610]  Go to the internment camp.
[02:35:33.650 --> 02:35:45.213]  Listen, listen, the federal judge called an internment camp and said, I don't care, and they lock you inside two fences inside a 2,800 square foot box, and there's really not many protesters there.
[02:35:45.753 --> 02:35:48.013]  I've got an article today about it because they're intimidated.
[02:35:48.073 --> 02:35:48.873]  This is the point.
[02:35:50.073 --> 02:35:50.894]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:35:51.754 --> 02:35:57.815]  A bunch of Montego there put up, you know, signs inside the fence saying, this is my First Amendment.
[02:35:57.975 --> 02:35:59.035]  This is where it got me.
[02:36:01.714 --> 02:36:05.035]  Listen, you don't have a First Amendment outside that cage!
[02:36:05.375 --> 02:36:05.975]  Right, yeah.
[02:36:06.255 --> 02:36:11.777]  I mean, turn what they're doing into... I mean, turn it against them!
[02:36:12.117 --> 02:36:14.698]  Well, that's actually what they're doing.
[02:36:14.718 --> 02:36:19.439]  The protesters are now going to go in, they said they would yesterday, and hold up signs that
[02:36:20.370 --> 02:36:29.201]  That again, outside that cage with M60s, think of this, protesters in a cage with M60 machine guns, I have the photos, AP photos, aimed at them.
[02:36:29.502 --> 02:36:30.883]  What message does that send?
[02:36:30.923 --> 02:36:38.133]  You're a criminal that needs to have troops aimed... Look, there's photos on the website today, links to stories that have it, of old ladies
[02:36:39.506 --> 02:36:46.272]  You know, saying abortion is wrong, and there are cops in black uniforms with MP5s pointed at them.
[02:36:46.813 --> 02:36:55.101]  We've got to point machine guns... We're so... Ladies are so dangerous, because we all saw what happened on 9-11, that we have to aim machine guns at them.
[02:36:55.441 --> 02:37:05.090]  Because when they take the pension funds, when they implode the economy, when they bring this country down all the way, which they admit they're going to do, they know you're going to riot in the streets, folks, and the cops are going to come out and kill you.
[02:37:05.610 --> 02:37:08.192]  So the point is, this is all training them to attack us.
[02:37:08.492 --> 02:37:11.154]  I told the police, really decide what side you're on.
[02:37:11.354 --> 02:37:13.096]  Get your head out of the sand, you idiots.
[02:37:13.356 --> 02:37:13.956]  Thanks for the call.
[02:37:15.017 --> 02:37:16.438]  And I mean those that go along with this.
[02:37:16.518 --> 02:37:17.479]  You are fools.
[02:37:17.999 --> 02:37:24.564]  This government puts cancer viruses in your vaccines, puts fluoride in your water, dumbs your kids down at the public schools.
[02:37:26.746 --> 02:37:26.846]  Ugh.
[02:37:27.767 --> 02:37:28.607]  Bob in Michigan.
[02:37:28.647 --> 02:37:29.388]  Bob, go ahead.
[02:37:30.313 --> 02:37:32.234]  Yeah, hello, Alex.
[02:37:32.615 --> 02:37:33.115]  Hello, sir.
[02:37:33.435 --> 02:37:34.376]  You can hear me okay?
[02:37:34.456 --> 02:37:34.896]  Yes, I can.
[02:37:34.916 --> 02:37:46.744]  I'll tell you a thing that's really burning me, and I mean really, really burning me, I'm going to write all three representatives and send it to the local news here, is this columnist, not against her, she wrote a good story.
[02:37:47.044 --> 02:37:49.365]  Her name is Michelle Balkin.
[02:37:49.826 --> 02:37:51.167]  She wrote a story in there.
[02:37:52.087 --> 02:37:53.948]  We're up in New Hampshire very recently.
[02:37:53.988 --> 02:37:55.449]  The date of this is July 22nd.
[02:37:56.730 --> 02:38:02.838]  Where the Sheriff's Department up there stopped a van and caught 10 illegal aliens and the
[02:38:03.857 --> 02:38:09.438]  The Sheriff and the local police is very frustrated, Bill, bewildered after five calls.
[02:38:09.858 --> 02:38:11.799]  This article says, calling the I.M.S.
[02:38:11.839 --> 02:38:16.120]  which, you know, which is Idiots, Dinkum Poops, and Stupidos, that's what I call them.
[02:38:16.220 --> 02:38:17.060]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:18.100]  Government's not dumb.
[02:38:18.140 --> 02:38:19.521]  It knows exactly what it's doing.
[02:38:19.881 --> 02:38:21.121]  And they let them go, didn't they?
[02:38:21.221 --> 02:38:22.341]  They let them go.
[02:38:22.361 --> 02:38:28.043]  Sir, I see, look, look, on the immigration websites, I see... Yeah, Elizabeth... No, no, let me stop you.
[02:38:28.363 --> 02:38:32.364]  Fifty, at least fifty articles a day when I look of this, this...
[02:38:33.204 --> 02:38:36.645]  Look, when you're an illegal alien, you have more rights than a citizen.
[02:38:36.685 --> 02:38:37.005]  Go ahead.
[02:38:37.025 --> 02:38:37.485]  I agree.
[02:38:37.905 --> 02:38:38.365]  I agree.
[02:38:38.926 --> 02:38:48.488]  Listen to this wording that says, they told him, says, well, if they're only guarding a variety of illegal aliens and not previously deported aliens or violent criminals, just let them go.
[02:38:48.748 --> 02:38:52.149]  And the deputy, I mean the sheriff up there, says, you've got to be kidding me.
[02:38:52.409 --> 02:38:53.610]  And get a load of this, one more.
[02:38:54.050 --> 02:39:02.092]  In Wenatchee, Washington State, Wenatchee, Washington, last month, she says, a man now charged with murder
[02:39:02.592 --> 02:39:04.334]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, now that is big.
[02:39:04.354 --> 02:39:05.374]  Can you send that to me?
[02:39:20.524 --> 02:39:24.407]  He allegedly killed a deputy, a god.
[02:39:24.427 --> 02:39:27.190]  I think he's a human being, it's wrong that that happened.
[02:39:28.571 --> 02:39:31.753]  And they released him because the illegal was a bigger god.
[02:39:33.146 --> 02:39:37.809]  Yeah, the name of the deputy was... Well, see, the citizens, we're way down here at nothing level.
[02:39:37.869 --> 02:39:38.630]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:39:38.970 --> 02:39:39.891]  Yeah, okay, I'm sorry.
[02:39:40.171 --> 02:39:48.457]  Also, okay, the local deputy's name was Saul Gallegos, in C-H-E-L-E-N, Cheechland, Washington State.
[02:39:48.857 --> 02:39:53.660]  Hey, do me a favor, email it to tips at infowars.com.
[02:39:54.241 --> 02:39:58.404]  Okay, tell your secretary to give me that address and I'll send it to you.
[02:39:59.124 --> 02:40:02.587]  Well, I don't have a secretary here on the radio, sir.
[02:40:03.129 --> 02:40:03.369]  Yeah.
[02:40:03.549 --> 02:40:05.091]  Okay, we'll give you that again real quick.
[02:40:05.331 --> 02:40:11.396]  Tips at InfoWars.com.
[02:40:11.956 --> 02:40:12.757]  Okay, I got it.
[02:40:13.137 --> 02:40:13.798]  Please send it.
[02:40:14.158 --> 02:40:14.899]  Thank you for the call.
[02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:21.084]  Yeah, and earlier in the call I was reading the Brownsville paper where there's all these Arabs and they just release them.
[02:40:23.101 --> 02:40:27.922]  But, but, but old ladies have got, they wake up and the whole neighborhood's got SWAT teams in it.
[02:40:28.303 --> 02:40:29.063]  You know, just, Oh!
[02:40:29.103 --> 02:40:30.063]  Rewardless searches!
[02:40:30.143 --> 02:40:30.483]  Hi!
[02:40:30.543 --> 02:40:31.003]  How you doing?
[02:40:31.043 --> 02:40:31.964]  It's our new freedom!
[02:40:32.084 --> 02:40:32.524]  Shut up!
[02:40:33.024 --> 02:40:34.044]  I've got a machine gun!
[02:40:35.505 --> 02:40:36.845]  Again, who watches the Watchers?
[02:40:36.885 --> 02:40:38.505]  Who controls an unbridled government?
[02:40:39.185 --> 02:40:46.127]  See, the people all know this now, but the government says, yeah, we've taken over your right to vote in most cities with electronic machines, and we've got machine guns in huge prisons!
[02:40:46.367 --> 02:40:46.808]  Shut up!
[02:40:48.968 --> 02:40:49.368]  Larry.
[02:40:50.509 --> 02:40:51.549]  Larry in Colorado.
[02:40:51.569 --> 02:40:52.189]  Go ahead, Larry.
[02:40:52.600 --> 02:40:55.021]  Alex, I'm pretty disgusted.
[02:40:55.962 --> 02:40:59.024]  We're not going to get much help from our representatives or senators.
[02:41:00.344 --> 02:41:14.312]  I was at a debate in Colorado here between two Senate candidates, a Coors and a Schaefer, and they were asked a question about the Patriot Act.
[02:41:14.612 --> 02:41:16.353]  What did Budweiser say?
[02:41:17.634 --> 02:41:18.094]  Oh, man.
[02:41:18.995 --> 02:41:21.416]  It's a stupid joke, but go ahead.
[02:41:21.798 --> 02:41:22.118]  All right.
[02:41:22.398 --> 02:41:27.482]  Well, they were asked, you know, that on 9-11 we were attacked by Al-Qaeda.
[02:41:27.882 --> 02:41:28.623]  Yeah, sure we were.
[02:41:28.703 --> 02:41:38.130]  And shortly after, President Bush and the Congress attacked the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the citizens of the United States with the Patriot Act.
[02:41:38.810 --> 02:41:41.552]  And what would they do to repeal such an un-American act?
[02:41:42.893 --> 02:41:44.354]  And it's amazing
[02:41:45.249 --> 02:41:51.374]  uh... the lies that come out of uh... uh... shaffer who was actually in the house and voted for it.
[02:41:51.554 --> 02:41:54.597]  Isn't that uh... Adolf Kurz's boy that's running, I forget?
[02:41:55.577 --> 02:42:11.350]  uh... it's Pete Kurz who's uh... running and he's running against Bob Shaffer and Shaffer was in the house and voted for uh... for the Patriot Act and he literally said that he studied that for a long period of time
[02:42:12.642 --> 02:42:15.905]  Before he voted on it, which we all know it was dumped on him really quick.
[02:42:15.925 --> 02:42:16.986]  Publicly, they admit it.
[02:42:17.026 --> 02:42:17.967]  Ron Paul admits it.
[02:42:18.007 --> 02:42:19.849]  They printed it at midnight and said, pass it.
[02:42:20.169 --> 02:42:21.150]  No one was allowed to read it.
[02:42:21.270 --> 02:42:22.191]  That's a total lie.
[02:42:22.692 --> 02:42:23.793]  And he still hasn't read it.
[02:42:24.358 --> 02:42:31.823]  Because he says that, well, he voted for it because he figured 59% of it was good and 41% was bad, and that it sunsetted in five years.
[02:42:31.904 --> 02:42:32.864]  He still hasn't read it.
[02:42:32.884 --> 02:42:35.946]  The sunset clause is just so they can add more.
[02:42:35.966 --> 02:42:39.089]  If you read carefully, all the key provisions are not sunsetted.
[02:42:39.489 --> 02:42:41.390]  They just want to expand it now.
[02:42:41.831 --> 02:42:44.132]  Well, that's what we told him, you know, afterwards.
[02:42:44.152 --> 02:42:48.015]  And, of course, afterwards he said he studied it for a month and a half, which he couldn't have.
[02:42:48.996 --> 02:42:53.319]  So, you know, we're in a lot of trouble here in Colorado, because when Pete Coors got up there,
[02:42:53.925 --> 02:42:59.430]  He comes straight out and said that, well, he will give up his rights to protect him and his family.
[02:43:00.311 --> 02:43:03.273]  And so he's everything our forefathers warned us against.
[02:43:03.293 --> 02:43:06.856]  Thanks for the call.
[02:43:07.016 --> 02:43:08.217]  Wolfgang in Minnesota.
[02:43:08.237 --> 02:43:09.098]  Wolfgang, go ahead.
[02:43:11.100 --> 02:43:11.680]  Hello, Alex.
[02:43:11.900 --> 02:43:12.241]  Yes, sir.
[02:43:12.621 --> 02:43:14.983]  Yes, I'm taking a big chance to call on you right now.
[02:43:15.343 --> 02:43:16.825]  I'm technically in jail.
[02:43:17.826 --> 02:43:20.548]  I was arrested here in Minnesota in my home state.
[02:43:20.588 --> 02:43:21.749]  I think you know the whole story.
[02:43:22.631 --> 02:43:22.791]  I think?
[02:43:36.761 --> 02:43:37.762]  It's just a big battle.
[02:43:38.122 --> 02:43:42.304]  I am evidence of what these people will do to you if you speak out against them.
[02:43:42.744 --> 02:43:47.207]  Well, depending on the area and what you do, that's not a good message that if you speak out, you go to jail.
[02:43:47.547 --> 02:43:50.829]  If you speak out, the whole country doesn't go into a prison state.
[02:43:51.209 --> 02:43:53.870]  No, that's true, but I'm a very vocal person.
[02:43:54.010 --> 02:43:56.492]  I had my own public access TV show, as you know.
[02:43:56.892 --> 02:44:00.594]  We ran Patriot Action Television Network here for quite a while.
[02:44:01.394 --> 02:44:04.436]  They're trying to punish me and shut me up any way they can.
[02:44:05.228 --> 02:44:06.649]  And I'm not going for it.
[02:44:07.450 --> 02:44:09.131]  What have they charged you with?
[02:44:09.211 --> 02:44:13.294]  It's an old charge from 1997 for carrying a handgun.
[02:44:13.314 --> 02:44:20.198]  I think Michael Trudeau knows about it and a whole bunch of other patriots around the country know about it right now.
[02:44:20.218 --> 02:44:21.539]  I remember you calling over the years.
[02:44:21.859 --> 02:44:23.000]  It's horrible.
[02:44:23.821 --> 02:44:26.883]  Yes, the state of Minnesota still has two of my children.
[02:44:26.923 --> 02:44:28.544]  They kidnapped them at gunpoint.
[02:44:29.284 --> 02:44:31.586]  They put my family through a whole bunch of stuff.
[02:44:32.341 --> 02:44:33.302]  I'm still fighting them.
[02:44:33.682 --> 02:44:35.883]  I'm going to be in here until September, I believe.
[02:44:38.004 --> 02:44:41.106]  I need people to write me letters, if that's possible.
[02:44:41.146 --> 02:44:43.007]  Can I give out the jail address?
[02:44:43.368 --> 02:44:43.648]  Sure.
[02:44:44.048 --> 02:44:44.648]  It's P.O.
[02:44:44.708 --> 02:44:47.690]  Box 159, Foley, Minnesota.
[02:44:48.471 --> 02:44:50.392]  And my name is Wolfgang Anacon.
[02:44:50.812 --> 02:44:52.493]  A-N-A-C-O-N.
[02:44:52.913 --> 02:44:53.254]  P.O.
[02:44:53.294 --> 02:44:56.175]  Box 159, Foley, Minnesota.
[02:44:57.396 --> 02:45:00.378]  I need letters of support from patriots all over the country.
[02:45:01.187 --> 02:45:02.067]  If that's possible.
[02:45:02.127 --> 02:45:03.228]  What do you need those letters for?
[02:45:03.788 --> 02:45:07.489]  To show the judge that I'm not a criminal for sticking up for the Second Amendment.
[02:45:07.509 --> 02:45:08.969]  That judge doesn't care about you.
[02:45:08.989 --> 02:45:11.150]  That judge is a fat-bellied possum.
[02:45:11.390 --> 02:45:13.911]  Wolfgang, stay in touch and God bless you, sir.
[02:45:14.251 --> 02:45:15.512]  Another political prisoner.
[02:45:16.232 --> 02:45:20.333]  And we can cower and be slaves and let it happen to everybody or we can stand up against it.
[02:45:21.013 --> 02:45:21.894]  Mark in Rhode Island.
[02:45:21.914 --> 02:45:22.614]  Mark, go ahead.
[02:45:23.294 --> 02:45:23.994]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:45:24.134 --> 02:45:26.835]  I think what's going on in Boston is absolutely disgusting.
[02:45:26.855 --> 02:45:29.496]  Alex, I was a Boston native and I was
[02:45:30.362 --> 02:45:34.965]  I had to do business in the Federal Building back about 97, 98.
[02:45:36.146 --> 02:45:42.930]  I walked into the Federal Building, turned to my left-hand side, looked at the marble wall, and what did it say on there?
[02:45:44.050 --> 02:45:45.651]  Novus Ordo Seclorum.
[02:45:47.813 --> 02:45:49.914]  Announcing the birth of the New World Order.
[02:45:50.674 --> 02:45:51.655]  And one other thing, Alex.
[02:45:51.715 --> 02:45:55.237]  I heard John Kerry on Fox News Radio earlier today.
[02:45:55.797 --> 02:45:56.998]  It was a quick soundbite.
[02:45:57.639 --> 02:45:58.219]  You know what he said?
[02:45:58.737 --> 02:46:04.919]  He said he calls on President Bush to implement all the recommendations in the 9-11 Commission.
[02:46:04.959 --> 02:46:05.839]  How about that, huh?
[02:46:05.859 --> 02:46:07.640]  The skull and bones for the skull and bones.
[02:46:07.760 --> 02:46:09.540]  Yeah, Bush appoints a committee.
[02:46:09.641 --> 02:46:11.261]  It says we want a domestic police state.
[02:46:11.281 --> 02:46:12.221]  Take all your liberties.
[02:46:12.541 --> 02:46:13.742]  Increase the government's power.
[02:46:13.762 --> 02:46:17.563]  That'll punish him for letting it happen.
[02:46:17.583 --> 02:46:21.224]  And Kerry wants everything Bush wants, and the Democrats just love it.
[02:46:21.404 --> 02:46:21.944]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:46:22.685 --> 02:46:23.325]  Thank you, sir.
[02:46:24.905 --> 02:46:26.526]  Paul in Delaware, didn't you already call?
[02:46:27.253 --> 02:46:28.133]  Yeah, I never got through.
[02:46:28.413 --> 02:46:29.114]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:46:29.394 --> 02:46:29.574]  Yeah.
[02:46:30.314 --> 02:46:31.834]  I want to just touch on a couple of things.
[02:46:31.894 --> 02:46:40.597]  First, there's a... in Wilmington, Delaware, last week they had a shift that they told the people at a mall running around like chickens with their heads cut off that there was a bomb out in the harbor.
[02:46:41.137 --> 02:46:43.537]  And then, of course, it was just another fake alert.
[02:46:43.557 --> 02:46:47.378]  Now, what I want to stress... Well, I mean, here in Austin, they've admittedly had fake drills.
[02:46:47.418 --> 02:46:49.899]  I tell you, two days later, were fake.
[02:46:50.019 --> 02:46:53.540]  These are terrorist actions by the government in every city to scare us.
[02:46:54.096 --> 02:46:58.018]  Yeah, and I've pointed that out, and I wrote a journey, you've got a few examples in there.
[02:46:58.438 --> 02:47:05.442]  Now, the psychological perspective that I want to give to this is, the boy that cried wolf, except it's a little bit different.
[02:47:06.042 --> 02:47:11.985]  They've got us all, you know, every time there's a terrorist attack, we say, oh, just another, you know, nothing happens, so we'll go to sleep.
[02:47:12.365 --> 02:47:18.688]  When the big one hits, if we're not careful, everyone's going to be asleep, and then they're going to want government to save them again.
[02:47:19.833 --> 02:47:21.014]  I just wanted to make that point.
[02:47:21.034 --> 02:47:22.994]  We've got to point out who's behind the terror.
[02:47:23.095 --> 02:47:23.675]  Yeah, also.
[02:47:23.735 --> 02:47:24.315]  Yeah, that too.
[02:47:24.675 --> 02:47:36.561]  Now, did you see, I'm pretty sure you had to have covered this, that almost three years later they show the footage in the Boston International Airport where they're pulling the so-called terrorists back off the plane and then let them on anyway.
[02:47:36.581 --> 02:47:37.201]  Did you see that?
[02:47:37.901 --> 02:47:38.402]  Yes, I did.
[02:47:38.782 --> 02:47:39.102]  Okay.
[02:47:39.842 --> 02:47:40.823]  And one other point.
[02:47:41.823 --> 02:47:47.906]  I've had good success with telling people about a video called, What Happened on the Way to the Moon?
[02:47:48.368 --> 02:47:53.290]  Now, when you're talking about the Perry cult and the George Bush cult members, it's kind of hard to get through to them.
[02:47:53.730 --> 02:48:01.352]  But with this video, what happened on the way to the moon, they play, they show you how they played you like a fiddle the whole way through.
[02:48:01.392 --> 02:48:06.734]  I mean, it's three hours and 40 minutes worth of devastating information just crushing the whole idea.
[02:48:07.501 --> 02:48:08.062]  We're good to go.
[02:48:27.537 --> 02:48:28.478]  I don't know what really happened.
[02:48:29.778 --> 02:48:31.119]  It's very sophisticated, folks.
[02:48:31.520 --> 02:48:32.300]  But thanks for the call.
[02:48:32.620 --> 02:48:33.221]  No more calls.
[02:48:33.241 --> 02:48:40.505]  I'm going to come back and get a few final news stories, tell you how to get my videos, and end this Tuesday, the 27th of July, 2004 edition, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:48:45.862 --> 02:48:52.705]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:53.005 --> 02:48:54.386]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:54.586 --> 02:48:56.787]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:56.947 --> 02:48:59.028]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:59.308 --> 02:49:04.250]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:04.570 --> 02:49:08.612]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:08.872 --> 02:49:10.634]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:10.714 --> 02:49:21.365]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plumbable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.525 --> 02:49:23.427]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:49:23.627 --> 02:49:25.589]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today.
[02:49:25.629 --> 02:49:25.989]  We're good.

[02:52:00.319 --> 02:52:02.761]  We've got to stand up to these bullies.
[02:52:03.181 --> 02:52:05.923]  We've got to point out the facts no matter how painful.
[02:52:06.743 --> 02:52:11.386]  I've heard a lot of listeners talk about how informative and life-changing my documentary films are.
[02:52:12.427 --> 02:52:20.812]  Whether it's America Destroyed by Design, America Wake Up or Waco, Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove,

[02:54:06.840 --> 02:54:08.800]  And it isn't going to happen until enough people have been woken up.
[02:54:10.061 --> 02:54:11.021]  But we can do it.

[02:54:42.741 --> 02:54:44.963]  PrisonPlanet.TV, please take action.
[02:54:46.924 --> 02:54:52.249]  Oh, there's so much news we covered and a lot we didn't get to, but it's just
[02:54:54.013 --> 02:54:55.233]  You know, there's new rules.
[02:54:55.273 --> 02:54:57.514]  When you get on a train or a bus, we're going to search you.
[02:54:57.554 --> 02:54:59.615]  No warrant, no law, just the rules.
[02:55:00.915 --> 02:55:03.596]  We're going to have random bag searches nationwide.
[02:55:05.917 --> 02:55:06.717]  Here's another article.
[02:55:06.777 --> 02:55:07.937]  Christian Science Monitor.
[02:55:07.977 --> 02:55:11.499]  Protestors leave a modest footprint so far.
[02:55:11.599 --> 02:55:13.079]  Christian Science Monitor today.
[02:55:13.739 --> 02:55:20.381]  Activists take on issue from the Iraq war, the two-party system, but security structures dampen the size of the turnout.
[02:55:21.162 --> 02:55:22.022]  I mean, that's your freedom.
[02:55:23.671 --> 02:55:26.012]  Just so sad to see that happening.
[02:55:26.412 --> 02:55:28.794]  Abortion protests barred at Kerry House.
[02:55:28.814 --> 02:55:32.477]  They're not allowed to even protest in the town where Kerry lives.
[02:55:32.977 --> 02:55:34.618]  They've got to be miles down the road.
[02:55:35.099 --> 02:55:36.179]  See, this is the new freedom.
[02:55:37.480 --> 02:55:40.342]  Oregon law would jail war protesters as terrorists.
[02:55:40.843 --> 02:55:44.645]  Some people have been denying this, so here's the Reuters article reposted with the bill.
[02:55:45.906 --> 02:55:47.207]  Senate Bill 742.
[02:55:47.888 --> 02:55:48.848]  Download music.
[02:55:49.169 --> 02:55:50.049]  Have a firearm.
[02:55:50.069 --> 02:55:51.710]  It lists over 100 crimes.
[02:55:53.121 --> 02:55:54.981]  The number one crime is blocking traffic.
[02:55:55.001 --> 02:56:05.464]  You get 25 years to life, an Oregon anti-terrorism bill with General Street blocking protesters for at least 25 years, and the thinly veiled effort to discourage anti-war demonstrations critics say.
[02:56:06.224 --> 02:56:15.606]  The bill has met strong opposition, but lawmakers still expect a debate on the definition of terrorism and the value of free speech before a vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[02:56:16.606 --> 02:56:18.887]  Now again, that's what your country is turned into.
[02:56:21.076 --> 02:56:25.763]  This is the type of stuff, they list over a hundred things that are terror in Senate Bill 742.
[02:56:25.863 --> 02:56:29.007]  I mean, come on.
[02:56:29.328 --> 02:56:29.809]  Come on, people.
[02:56:30.329 --> 02:56:32.332]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight, back tomorrow 11 to 2.
[02:56:32.632 --> 02:56:33.394]  God bless you all.
[02:56:33.414 --> 02:56:34.816]  Get out there and take on tyranny!
