[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.381]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.042 --> 00:00:08.103]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.803 --> 00:00:09.924]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.565 --> 00:00:11.405]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.146 --> 00:00:13.067]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.707 --> 00:00:17.330]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.891 --> 00:00:22.035]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.402]  Oh my goodness, my friends, it's already Friday.
[00:00:30.422 --> 00:00:30.502]  Hey!
[00:00:31.357 --> 00:00:32.838]  The 29th day of October 2004.
[00:00:33.418 --> 00:00:35.840]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.761 --> 00:00:45.006]  We have Victoria Collier, whose father and uncle were some of the first to really expose how serious the election fraud was years ago.
[00:00:45.146 --> 00:00:46.027]  She's joining us.
[00:00:46.047 --> 00:00:50.190]  She's been on the cutting edge for years, exposing the latest developments.
[00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.633]  We also have Tex Mars coming on to talk about the history of Halloween, but...
[00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.831]  Really, there's no need to even have texts or myself on to talk about it.
[00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:08.615]  I've got three or four Associated Press articles admitting that it is a human sacrifice holiday that did not become popular or even known in the U.S.
[00:01:09.055 --> 00:01:09.736]  until the 1950s.
[00:01:11.056 --> 00:01:12.297]  But now we just accept it.
[00:01:13.477 --> 00:01:15.118]  And kids have a lot of fun on Halloween.
[00:01:15.138 --> 00:01:18.680]  There's also a lot of abductions and murders and a lot of people being killed around the U.S.
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.000]  right now.
[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.182]  It'll be found in gutters and trash heaps, but it'll be in the back of the newspaper.
[00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:26.663]  Well, the globalists like to do similar things themselves.
[00:01:26.703 --> 00:01:27.963]  They worship the same God.
[00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:31.185]  So we'll be talking about that, and of course, obviously, the election.
[00:01:31.205 --> 00:01:38.890]  The websites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and of course, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.332]  We've also relaunched and redesigned Infowars.net.
[00:01:42.373 --> 00:01:46.915]  It has its own webmaster, so it has some of its own news and flavor and information.
[00:01:47.756 --> 00:01:52.479]  Steve Watson, Paul Watson's brother, is running that site, doing a great job, so be sure and check out
[00:01:53.217 --> 00:01:55.258]  InfoWars.net today.
[00:01:56.818 --> 00:01:59.199]  American Voice on new terror video.
[00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:04.841]  ABC News is in possession of a tape reportedly from the group threatening attacks on the U.S., and it's a guy with a U.S.
[00:02:04.961 --> 00:02:05.241]  accent.
[00:02:05.261 --> 00:02:06.061]  It's a white guy.
[00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:10.442]  They can't even find fake Arabs anymore for these fake videos.
[00:02:12.303 --> 00:02:16.464]  And why we're going to get attacked, just any minute now, so submit to the police state.
[00:02:16.504 --> 00:02:19.505]  But the CIA says they can't authenticate their own tape.
[00:02:19.585 --> 00:02:21.326]  I mean, the tape threatening the...
[00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:22.965]  The U.S.
[00:02:23.346 --> 00:02:29.068]  Meanwhile, Homeland Security is busy out working on harassing toy stores.
[00:02:29.128 --> 00:02:30.389]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:49.598]  The patent on the Rubik's Cube ran out, and that's admitted, and so a company made their own Rubik's Cube, and she was just a toy store selling it, and they dropped by and told her it was a national security situation, and it didn't have a warrant, didn't have a judge's order, just said, take your Rubik's Cubes off the shelf.
[00:02:52.125 --> 00:02:55.007]  And the implied threat is, you're going to Guantanamo, baby.
[00:02:56.048 --> 00:02:59.170]  So I guess we need to add that to the section we've got on Prison Planet.
[00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:16.561]  The dozens and dozens and dozens of mainstream articles were pot dealers, county commissioners, bid rigging, family disturbances, getting onto environmentally sensitive land when you're not supposed to, hiking in the wrong area, and now toy store sales.
[00:03:17.942 --> 00:03:19.103]  Toy stores, Rubik's Cubes.
[00:03:19.853 --> 00:03:21.434]  Yes, it's the Associated Press.
[00:03:21.474 --> 00:03:25.695]  The evil Rubik's Cube is a weapon of mass destruction.
[00:03:26.656 --> 00:03:28.396]  Maybe we should send Heist Blitz.
[00:03:28.896 --> 00:03:30.557]  Heist Blitz should come check it out.
[00:03:30.837 --> 00:03:32.398]  Hey, Heist Blitz, how you doing, buddy?
[00:03:32.418 --> 00:03:34.258]  Glad to see my Rubik's Cube.
[00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:40.221]  All right, then that's another line, folks, that I've improvised from Team America.
[00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:43.822]  But it's just getting crazy here, my friends.
[00:03:45.303 --> 00:03:47.803]  Meanwhile, you know, I didn't really talk about this yesterday.
[00:03:47.823 --> 00:03:49.024]  I should have.
[00:03:49.955 --> 00:03:50.455]  But I didn't.
[00:03:50.955 --> 00:04:05.019]  Because, frankly, Bush flipping people off is not as newsworthy as race-specific bioweapons and staged elections and police targeting peaceful protesters and beating them and killing them.
[00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.339]  So we didn't really spend much time on it.
[00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:08.120]  I did mention it.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.240]  We have the video clip up on InfoWars.com since yesterday.
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.462]  But we will play the audio of our supreme maximum savior and leader,
[00:04:18.528 --> 00:04:19.849]  He's greater than Kim Jong-il.
[00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.410]  He's greater than Fidel Castro.
[00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.512]  He is protecting us from the evil hordes that he created, of course.
[00:04:26.213 --> 00:04:27.753]  And we'll be playing that clip.
[00:04:27.793 --> 00:04:33.537]  And also, there's been a lot of attention on this Daily Show host appearance on Crossfire a few weeks ago.
[00:04:33.977 --> 00:04:37.899]  We'll play that exchange as well in this first hour.
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.081]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:46.454 --> 00:04:46.714]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:46.734 --> 00:04:52.724]  We will get you up and on the air.
[00:04:53.645 --> 00:04:59.475]  So it's a big edition of the broadcast on this Friday as we rush towards the election less than four days away.
[00:05:01.565 --> 00:05:05.168]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:06.809]  If so, hope has arrived.
[00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:08.731]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[00:05:08.991 --> 00:05:14.175]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[00:05:14.535 --> 00:05:19.018]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:28.025]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[00:05:28.485 --> 00:05:29.126]  Gum disease is
[00:05:29.206 --> 00:05:30.226]  We're good to go.
[00:05:30.266 --> 00:05:30.926]  We're good to go.
[00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:02.614]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:02.735 --> 00:06:06.838]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:06:06.978 --> 00:06:09.860]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:09.941 --> 00:06:16.686]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:16.846 --> 00:06:19.849]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:06:20.049 --> 00:06:22.451]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:22.571 --> 00:06:27.295]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[00:06:27.475 --> 00:06:42.042]  Try halo-methanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:06:42.202 --> 00:06:48.885]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[00:06:51.826 --> 00:06:52.226]  There is a...
[00:07:11.693 --> 00:07:13.755]  This disaster is a new world order.
[00:07:13.855 --> 00:07:16.677]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:07:16.938 --> 00:07:21.161]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:21.221 --> 00:07:28.167]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:28.287 --> 00:07:30.289]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:30.709]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:30.749 --> 00:07:31.790]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:08:05.791 --> 00:08:06.431]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.092 --> 00:08:08.152]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.853 --> 00:08:09.973]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.613 --> 00:08:11.454]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.194 --> 00:08:14.115]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.135 --> 00:08:17.417]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.957 --> 00:08:22.079]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.299 --> 00:08:30.003]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:30.043 --> 00:08:30.984]  until 2 p.m.
[00:08:31.564 --> 00:08:32.585]  Central Standard Time.
[00:08:34.193 --> 00:08:37.155]  Back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:08:37.175 --> 00:08:43.659]  We go out on the AM and FM dial on a growing list of just fabulous AM and FM affiliates who we just want to thank.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:49.403]  And of course, simulcasting on the internet at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:08:50.383 --> 00:08:53.125]  And on Global Shortwave at night from 9 to midnight at 3210.
[00:08:53.906 --> 00:08:58.869]  And it's always been at 9475 for the longest time during the day.
[00:08:58.909 --> 00:09:03.552]  But starting Monday, you're going to hear this broadcast on the shortwave at a different frequency.
[00:09:04.418 --> 00:09:09.683]  And that is 9.985.
[00:09:11.245 --> 00:09:13.087]  9.985 starting Monday.
[00:09:14.468 --> 00:09:21.335]  Please tell your friends and family who listen over shortwave or the message boards, whatever out there, that that is the new frequency.
[00:09:21.355 --> 00:09:22.396]  9.985 starting Monday.
[00:09:25.658 --> 00:09:45.715]  Okay, before I plunge into the latest Iraq news and terror threat news and homeland security harassing toy stores and all the police state information and tell you about several of the guests that are coming up and start going to your calls at 1-800-259-9231, I want to play this clip of George W. Bush.
[00:09:45.755 --> 00:09:49.779]  This is back when he was running for governor in the mid-1990s.
[00:09:51.867 --> 00:10:02.154]  And the governor, soon-to-be governor, is sitting there looking completely psychotic, completely squirrely, and he's angry at somebody, bugging his eyes out at them.
[00:10:02.174 --> 00:10:04.476]  And he says, quit telling me what to do.
[00:10:04.976 --> 00:10:08.019]  And then he bends his head down, runs his fingers through his hair.
[00:10:08.079 --> 00:10:11.741]  You know that classic gesticulation somebody does when they're about to throw a fit?
[00:10:11.761 --> 00:10:12.922]  They're trying to control themselves.
[00:10:12.942 --> 00:10:21.168]  He, like, grips his head and runs his hands through it and bends down and looks back up angry and flips the camera off and then contains himself and makes a joke out of it.
[00:10:22.322 --> 00:10:29.581]  And, you know, I haven't spent a lot of time talking about Bill O'Reilly's sexual harassment case, though people love it.
[00:10:30.333 --> 00:10:34.376]  You know, it's got the classic soap opera tabloid taste to it.
[00:10:34.816 --> 00:10:59.853]  I haven't spent time on issues like this because compared to race-specific bioweapons proliferating and, you know, guests like that yesterday, the head of ethics and science for the British Medical Association or new terror alerts and the government setting up a martial law system and crude oil over $55 a barrel and all of this type of stuff happening, it's really dwarfed insignificance.
[00:11:01.164 --> 00:11:11.992]  Just to get a window into the mind of Bush, this is what we've heard from trusted publications in the last few months, like Capitol Hill Blue, who reported accurately on Bill Clinton.
[00:11:12.072 --> 00:11:13.673]  I mean, they're really a conservative publication.
[00:11:14.894 --> 00:11:19.898]  That good old George W. throws fits, flips people off, cusses at them.
[00:11:20.458 --> 00:11:22.440]  Anybody that challenges him, he screams at them.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.563]  And the audio really doesn't capture this, but the video does.
[00:11:26.623 --> 00:11:28.785]  And so if you can, go to Infowars.com.
[00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:30.326]  I hope you'll do it and go watch it.
[00:11:30.986 --> 00:11:37.988]  But here is the audio of Bush getting ready for a news interview and behaving like this.
[00:11:38.188 --> 00:11:47.390]  And you hear him describing how he is giving somebody the hand sign expletive for the middle finger.
[00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.850]  Here it is.
[00:11:49.051 --> 00:11:50.451]  He's still telling me what to do.
[00:11:50.471 --> 00:11:50.451]  5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[00:11:51.351 --> 00:11:51.771]  Okay.
[00:11:56.257 --> 00:12:05.884]  Just a one-finger victory salute.
[00:12:07.885 --> 00:12:13.089]  But again, the 30 seconds or 25 seconds of video tells a thousand words.
[00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:16.171]  The audio really doesn't, so that's on the site.
[00:12:16.231 --> 00:12:19.154]  But can you imagine if they had a video of John Kerry doing this?
[00:12:19.174 --> 00:12:20.735]  It would be on national TV ads.
[00:12:21.425 --> 00:12:25.127]  But because Kerry is rolling over for Bush, it's a staged event.
[00:12:25.527 --> 00:12:28.088]  Don't expect to see this be part of the debate.
[00:12:29.168 --> 00:12:35.931]  I mean, they go nuts with Kerry out there, obviously staging things in his duck hunting outfit and camo.
[00:12:36.311 --> 00:12:37.451]  It's pretty ridiculous.
[00:12:38.192 --> 00:12:39.072]  It's a total fraud.
[00:12:39.132 --> 00:12:40.333]  Kerry does want your guns.
[00:12:40.373 --> 00:12:43.314]  He's said it many times and voted for it hundreds of times.
[00:12:43.354 --> 00:12:45.094]  But Bush is staging things, too.
[00:12:45.114 --> 00:12:48.916]  They've had to pull a TV ad because, well, they, with video, faked
[00:12:49.525 --> 00:12:50.546]  Crowd responses.
[00:12:51.206 --> 00:12:52.547]  It's a staged TV ad.
[00:12:52.607 --> 00:12:54.007]  Well, I mean, what isn't staged?
[00:12:54.608 --> 00:13:07.515]  Bush likes to stand up in front of boxes with stenciled Made in the USA painted, you know, in giant letters across it while the Made in China is taped over with tape, which, by the way, is a federal crime to do that inside a warehouse or store.
[00:13:08.135 --> 00:13:09.356]  It's actually a felony, but hey.
[00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:13.051]  The laws are for us, not for our commander-in-chief.
[00:13:13.472 --> 00:13:19.836]  In fact, the Pentagon has even said that Bush is above the law, that he can order torture and other things if he wants, because he is above the law.
[00:13:19.856 --> 00:13:20.977]  Of course, that's not true.
[00:13:21.777 --> 00:13:27.421]  Leaders are supposed to be held to a higher standard of the law, but this is the new freedom when you're living in despotism.
[00:13:29.203 --> 00:13:31.704]  And I tell you what, let's go ahead and do this now, too.
[00:13:32.705 --> 00:13:38.529]  We'll play the Daily Show thing a little bit later, where he blows up at the people on Crossfire.
[00:13:38.549 --> 00:13:39.490]  We'll do that a little bit later.
[00:13:40.396 --> 00:13:41.678]  Let's go ahead and get into this now.
[00:13:42.058 --> 00:13:51.148]  American voice of new terror video, ABC News, is in possession of tape reportedly from the group threatening attacks on the United States.
[00:13:51.248 --> 00:13:52.489]  Islamabad, Pakistan.
[00:13:53.029 --> 00:14:00.978]  A new videotape that has surfaced in Pakistan threatens a massive attack against the United States by a purported American member of Al-Siaida.
[00:14:01.773 --> 00:14:09.417]  It is not yet known if the tape is an authentic Al-Si'aida production, but it bears enough resemblance that some experts are taking the tape seriously.
[00:14:09.837 --> 00:14:23.185]  The chilling 75-minute digital video, seen by the Christian Science Monitor, reported in Pakistan, where it was obtained by ABC News, shows a high degree of sophistication and bears the logo of Al-Si'aida's video production house, As-Sahab.
[00:14:24.145 --> 00:14:29.188]  On the video, the unknown man's face is masked with a Palestinian scarf and sunglasses.
[00:14:30.293 --> 00:14:38.678]  And it says he stabs the air with his finger, which appears to be a fair-skinned, as he delivers his warning in American accent and English.
[00:14:39.218 --> 00:14:41.900]  Allah willing, the streets of America will run red with blood.
[00:14:43.521 --> 00:14:54.387]  Matching drop for drop, the blood of American victims, says the speaker, who calls himself Asim al-Amarqi, or Asim the American, which took place on September 11th.
[00:14:55.639 --> 00:14:58.402]  But was the opening salvo in a global war on America.
[00:14:58.442 --> 00:15:04.968]  The next attack, he adds, will come at any moment and will be much larger than 9-11.
[00:15:05.248 --> 00:15:19.081]  Now remember about five months ago, a 20-year-old computer kid in San Francisco produced a fake beheading in his garage and
[00:15:19.986 --> 00:15:25.127]  And everybody said it was real for a week, and then the retraction was in the back of the newspapers, and people still think that was a real beheading, too.
[00:15:25.147 --> 00:15:33.510]  Then we have all these other questionable beheadings where people admittedly get picked up by the FBI and then immediately handed over to a car of men in black masks.
[00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:41.212]  Aid workers get picked up by 50 Iraqi government officials led by, quote, white men.
[00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:42.692]  That's mainstream news.
[00:15:43.572 --> 00:15:45.753]  And then they get taken off to have their heads sawed off.
[00:15:46.528 --> 00:15:50.238]  It goes on and on and on and on and on and on.
[00:15:51.536 --> 00:15:53.837]  And we have the fat bin Laden tape of him in a dark room.
[00:15:53.857 --> 00:15:54.577]  Wasn't even bin Laden.
[00:15:54.597 --> 00:15:55.397]  Wasn't even the same voice.
[00:15:55.417 --> 00:15:58.658]  They admitted later with voice print and face scan it was not bin Laden.
[00:15:59.258 --> 00:16:00.998]  They admit it's fake, but again, in the back of the paper.
[00:16:01.038 --> 00:16:06.539]  It's like the passport that fell out of the plane at the World Trade Center, but the voice recorders were destroyed.
[00:16:06.559 --> 00:16:07.700]  And we found out that wasn't true.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.220]  Philadelphia Daily News.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.181]  Yesterday, firefighters and emergency workers have gone public.
[00:16:13.001 --> 00:16:16.142]  And then they said, okay, well, it was fake, but we're not going to tell you how we retracted it.
[00:16:16.162 --> 00:16:17.402]  Just it's fake in the back of the paper.
[00:16:18.251 --> 00:16:20.934]  Still, the average person will tell you, they found a passport!
[00:16:21.354 --> 00:16:21.795]  Shut up!
[00:16:21.835 --> 00:16:22.556]  They've got evidence!
[00:16:23.897 --> 00:16:28.862]  And so it's the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[00:16:29.763 --> 00:16:32.306]  This is being used to fearmonger by everybody now.
[00:16:32.326 --> 00:16:34.968]  And they're saying, why won't ABC run it?
[00:16:35.008 --> 00:16:36.330]  It's obviously real!
[00:16:37.436 --> 00:16:39.979]  So, very, very interesting there.
[00:16:40.019 --> 00:16:52.009]  But the CIA, because they can't authenticate tape threat to the U.S., the CIA is unable to authenticate a videotape in which a man claiming to be Al-Qaeda's terrorist warns of devastating new attacks on the United States.
[00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.610]  A senior U.S.
[00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:56.253]  intelligence official told NBC News today, and it's another...
[00:16:57.415 --> 00:16:58.296]  Situation here.
[00:16:58.396 --> 00:17:01.037]  Video suggests explosives disappeared after U.S.
[00:17:01.057 --> 00:17:01.658]  took control.
[00:17:01.718 --> 00:17:03.979]  Suggest explosives disappeared after U.S.
[00:17:03.999 --> 00:17:04.700]  took control.
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:08.983]  And John Kerry has jumped onto this.
[00:17:10.184 --> 00:17:12.225]  Also, campaign ceases on Halliburton probe.
[00:17:12.245 --> 00:17:14.086]  Campaign ceases on FBI probe of Halliburton.
[00:17:14.426 --> 00:17:21.191]  Bush to share stage with Schwarzenegger, who is more liberal than Bill Clinton, so that's why neocons just love him.
[00:17:22.114 --> 00:17:30.460]  After days of trying to make political hay over lost Iraqi explosives, the Democratic ticket turned Friday to the FBI probe with Halliburton as evidence of Bush administration's special favors.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.640]  It's a special interest.
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:38.145]  President Bush was campaigning with actor, politician Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:17:38.925 --> 00:17:47.391]  We need a president and a vice president of the United States who consistently stand up for the interests of the American people, and that's not what we're seeing right now.
[00:17:50.778 --> 00:17:52.660]  That's John Edwards, not Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:53.440]  Being sarcastic.
[00:17:54.621 --> 00:18:00.706]  Meanwhile, Bush TV ad pulled over doctored crowd scene, like this doctored Al-Qaeda type Bush.
[00:18:01.446 --> 00:18:07.651]  George Bush's campaign team has been forced to pull a television advert after admitting a picture of the president.
[00:18:09.266 --> 00:18:09.826]  We're good to go.
[00:18:31.278 --> 00:18:33.880]  And his podium obscured part of the crowd of soldiers.
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:39.265]  The people who made the advert removed the image of Mr. Bush, replacing him with duplicated images of soldiers.
[00:18:39.465 --> 00:18:42.467]  Well, that's just classic manipulation there.
[00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:46.551]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:18:47.211 --> 00:18:48.792]  The borders are completely wide open.
[00:18:49.053 --> 00:18:50.994]  A thousand and less Border Patrol on the southern border.
[00:18:51.014 --> 00:18:53.236]  About 200 less on the northern border.
[00:18:53.777 --> 00:18:54.517]  That doesn't matter.
[00:18:54.557 --> 00:18:56.118]  They're out there dealing with toy stores.
[00:18:56.179 --> 00:18:58.400]  Homeland Security agents visited Toy Store AP.
[00:18:59.657 --> 00:19:12.926]  So far as she knows, Puffer Belly Toys owner Stephanie Cox hasn't been passing any state secrets to sinister foreign governments or violating obscure clauses in the Patriot Act.
[00:19:13.506 --> 00:19:16.228]  So she was taken aback by a mysterious phone call from the U.S.
[00:19:16.248 --> 00:19:21.751]  Department of Homeland Security to a small toy store in quiet Columbia River town just north of Portland.
[00:19:22.412 --> 00:19:25.514]  I was shaking in my shoes, Cox said at the September phone call.
[00:19:25.954 --> 00:19:27.295]  My first thought was the government...
[00:19:28.021 --> 00:19:33.864]  And shut your business down on a whim, in my opinion, if I'm closed even for a day, that would cause undue stress.
[00:19:35.345 --> 00:19:40.308]  When the two agents arrived at the store, we'll tell you about this when we get back.
[00:19:40.368 --> 00:19:44.551]  I told her that this is very serious under Homeland.
[00:19:45.471 --> 00:19:48.533]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'll tell you what she was selling.
[00:19:50.014 --> 00:19:53.236]  When we get back, I think she should be sent to Guantanamo immediately.
[00:19:54.877 --> 00:19:57.218]  So we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, as Homeland Security...
[00:19:58.323 --> 00:20:00.505]  It's involved in civil matters for their bosses.
[00:20:28.383 --> 00:20:33.707]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:20:33.967 --> 00:20:38.710]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation.
[00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:46.675]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:20:46.995 --> 00:20:52.458]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:20:53.539 --> 00:20:55.200]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.

[00:21:11.772 --> 00:21:19.377]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:21:19.637 --> 00:21:22.739]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:21:22.899 --> 00:21:23.300]  We're good to go.
[00:21:41.576 --> 00:21:47.520]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.

[00:21:52.424 --> 00:21:54.245]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:54.265 --> 00:21:56.667]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:24.054]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny?
[00:22:25.014 --> 00:22:30.215]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.

[00:23:31.526 --> 00:23:32.647]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[00:23:32.807 --> 00:23:33.567]  Which are collectible?

[00:24:04.507 --> 00:24:15.934]  Homeland Security agents visit toy store.
[00:24:15.954 --> 00:24:23.739]  When the two agents arrive at the toy store, the lead agent, Ass Cox, the owner of the Huffer Belly Toys,
[00:24:24.525 --> 00:24:31.230]  Whether she carried a toy called the Magic Cube, which he said was an illegal copy of the Rubik's Cube, one of the most popular toys of all time.
[00:24:31.891 --> 00:24:36.635]  He told her to remove the Magic Cube from her shelves, and he watched to make sure she complied.
[00:24:37.415 --> 00:24:49.985]  After the agent's left cocks called the manufacturer of Magic Cube, the Toy Smith Group, which is based in Auburn, Washington, a representative told her that Rubik's Cube hadn't had expired and that Magic Cube had not infringed on the rival toy's trademark.
[00:24:50.586 --> 00:24:50.946]  Virginia...
[00:24:51.733 --> 00:25:03.577]  Kice, a spokeswoman for Imagination and Customs Enforcement, said the agents went to Puffer Belly based on a trademark infringement complaint filed in the agency's Intellectual Property Rights Center in D.C.
[00:25:04.237 --> 00:25:14.780]  One of the things that our agency is responsible for is protecting the integrity of the economy and our nation's financial system, and obviously trademark infringement does have significant economic implications, she said.
[00:25:15.999 --> 00:25:21.025]  Six weeks after her brush with Homeland Security, Cox told the Oregonian she is still bewildered by the experience.
[00:25:21.365 --> 00:25:23.288]  Aren't there any terrorists out there, she said?
[00:25:24.089 --> 00:25:24.970]  No, there's not, folks.
[00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:28.594]  Infrastructure protection will be every gas station...
[00:25:29.588 --> 00:25:42.279]  Every bus depot, every dental office, every grocery store, every amusement park, every part of the economy will be run by Homeland Security.
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.422]  You will have no rights, no due process.
[00:25:45.662 --> 00:25:49.045]  You'll have to have an ID card that says you're in good standing to have a job.
[00:25:49.806 --> 00:25:53.469]  Ridge said all of this two years ago on C-SPAN.
[00:25:54.526 --> 00:25:56.711]  And no, they're not out looking for terrorists, folks.
[00:25:56.731 --> 00:25:58.575]  They're actually funding them and training them.
[00:25:58.595 --> 00:26:02.983]  They have hit teams ready to suitcase nuke, dirty bomb cities, you name it.
[00:26:03.244 --> 00:26:04.526]  They are not here to protect you.
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.503]  Just type Patriot Act compliance into a search engine.
[00:26:07.823 --> 00:26:09.324]  Hundreds of thousands of links will come up.
[00:26:09.485 --> 00:26:10.305]  It is everything.
[00:26:10.666 --> 00:26:11.907]  It is the end of America.
[00:26:12.368 --> 00:26:14.530]  It has nothing to do with terrorism.
[00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:25.181]  Every time I see an article about a billion here, 500 million there, 20 million here, for cameras going in small towns, big cities, you know, a billion two for New York, 500 million for San Antonio.
[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.501]  We're going to fight terror and crime.
[00:26:28.641 --> 00:26:46.910]  And now the Chicago newspaper here, where they say that it's going to face scan, track everything you do, it says loitering, aimless wandering, suspicious characters, putting a package at someone's door, street sweepers will have cameras mounted on them, all the buses, everything.
[00:26:47.771 --> 00:26:49.872]  It's going in nationwide, but here's the Chicago newspaper.
[00:26:50.273 --> 00:26:51.373]  This is it, folks.
[00:26:51.553 --> 00:26:59.479]  Everything you do, track and trace, everything of criminal activity, lots of prisons being built by the terrorists who deal the drugs.
[00:26:59.519 --> 00:27:03.961]  The drug-dealing terrorists run the country, and they're going to catch you all in the net and make you their slaves.
[00:27:04.001 --> 00:27:04.702]  I mean, it's real simple.
[00:27:06.583 --> 00:27:09.465]  The whole economy being re-engineered into this police state system.
[00:27:10.587 --> 00:27:16.030]  And so toy stores that are selling legal toys, by the way, they didn't go to the factory where they're being made because it's legal there.
[00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:21.273]  They just go out and harass people for a legal, lawful toy.
[00:27:22.954 --> 00:27:26.536]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michelle in Missouri.
[00:27:26.576 --> 00:27:27.377]  Michelle, go ahead.
[00:27:28.177 --> 00:27:28.537]  Hi.
[00:27:28.898 --> 00:27:29.218]  Hello.
[00:27:29.658 --> 00:27:29.798]  Hello.
[00:27:30.018 --> 00:27:32.200]  I just wanted to comment on you, your show.
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:32.680]  I like it.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:37.843]  I'm just a recent listener, and I'm a member of your own, prisonplanet.com.
[00:27:39.144 --> 00:27:39.684]  Well, thank you.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.781]  And I'm jumbling my words up.
[00:27:41.841 --> 00:27:42.261]  I'm nervous.
[00:27:42.281 --> 00:27:42.982]  No, you're not.
[00:27:43.102 --> 00:27:43.963]  Yeah, I am.
[00:27:45.163 --> 00:27:48.445]  And I was just going to comment on the terror alert.
[00:27:48.946 --> 00:27:49.226]  Yes.
[00:27:49.546 --> 00:27:50.787]  I'm really upset about that.
[00:27:50.827 --> 00:27:52.468]  I think they need to knock that off.
[00:27:52.628 --> 00:27:56.791]  Now we have white guys with a New Jersey accent saying, I'm Al Qaeda, I'll get you.
[00:27:57.549 --> 00:27:58.669]  Yep, I'm pretty upset about that.
[00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:59.730]  But that's all I needed to say.
[00:28:20.211 --> 00:28:24.213]  Well, Michelle, I appreciate your support, and it's good to have you as a member of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:28:24.834 --> 00:28:25.574]  Keep up the good work.
[00:28:25.874 --> 00:28:26.275]  You bet.
[00:28:26.295 --> 00:28:28.516]  Chad, where are you calling us from?
[00:28:28.536 --> 00:28:29.176]  You're up next.
[00:28:30.317 --> 00:28:30.597]  Hello?
[00:28:30.917 --> 00:28:31.998]  Yes, where are you calling us from?
[00:28:32.018 --> 00:28:32.938]  Missouri.
[00:28:33.138 --> 00:28:33.539]  Welcome.
[00:28:34.179 --> 00:28:37.661]  I was the one that got pulled over by the Gestapo last week.
[00:28:37.681 --> 00:28:41.423]  A lot of people get pulled over by the Gestapo.
[00:28:41.503 --> 00:28:43.064]  I had to show my papers to them.
[00:28:43.665 --> 00:28:45.706]  Oh, when you called in on the show, yeah.
[00:28:45.866 --> 00:28:47.046]  You called in as it was happening.
[00:28:47.527 --> 00:28:47.727]  Yeah.
[00:28:48.621 --> 00:28:50.681]  Well, I just wanted to call.
[00:28:51.542 --> 00:28:54.802]  I'd gotten them the 9-11 Rotary from you last week.
[00:28:55.922 --> 00:29:02.564]  And speaking of them having this all-powerful, they can do whatever, and it's not just the government anymore.
[00:29:02.844 --> 00:29:10.085]  It's going over into the civilian side, you know, to the SEC, the bouncers, Federal Express, UPS.
[00:29:10.105 --> 00:29:13.246]  Because that disc that you sent us, the package was fine.
[00:29:13.286 --> 00:29:15.346]  Like, it didn't happen when you sent it.
[00:29:16.195 --> 00:29:19.856]  But when we got it, there was a big hole in it, like somebody stabbed it.
[00:29:20.996 --> 00:29:21.557]  DVD.
[00:29:21.917 --> 00:29:25.458]  And it actually went through into the DVD and messed the DVD up.
[00:29:26.118 --> 00:29:28.658]  Which I know had nothing to do with you guys.
[00:29:29.059 --> 00:29:29.919]  Well, do this.
[00:29:30.499 --> 00:29:32.820]  That happens sometimes, but it happens to other mail I get.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.301]  I mean, I'll order a sweater and it's got a big rip in it.
[00:29:37.081 --> 00:29:37.961]  Just call us.
[00:29:38.001 --> 00:29:39.001]  We'll send you another one, sir.
[00:29:39.682 --> 00:29:39.982]  Okay.
[00:29:41.162 --> 00:29:43.463]  We'll start having a segment on the show for customer service.
[00:29:44.563 --> 00:29:45.023]  Just call my
[00:29:47.336 --> 00:29:50.459]  I'll tell you what, you're going to have to stay there.
[00:29:50.479 --> 00:29:51.320]  We've got a guest coming up.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:52.681]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.141 --> 00:29:54.763]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.683 --> 00:29:58.366]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.326 --> 00:30:04.348]  You and your family members getting enough minerals on the daily diet?
[00:30:04.368 --> 00:30:07.250]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[00:30:07.491 --> 00:30:14.576]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[00:30:14.736 --> 00:30:18.038]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[00:30:18.278 --> 00:30:20.320]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:28.486]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[00:30:28.726 --> 00:30:29.326]  We're good to go.
[00:30:58.886 --> 00:31:06.169]  SeamMineral.com Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:31:06.309 --> 00:31:14.411]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:31:14.652 --> 00:31:21.714]  Medical Corps' potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:31:22.655 --> 00:31:29.161]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:31:29.342 --> 00:31:34.447]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:31:34.547 --> 00:31:43.396]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:31:43.596 --> 00:31:44.117]  We're good to go.
[00:32:00.618 --> 00:32:02.981]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:32:03.241 --> 00:32:07.085]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:32:07.385 --> 00:32:08.206]  Read the labels.
[00:32:08.647 --> 00:32:12.751]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:32:12.992 --> 00:32:17.176]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:32:17.557 --> 00:32:22.442]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:32:22.802 --> 00:32:26.404]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:32:26.584 --> 00:32:31.927]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:32:32.187 --> 00:32:34.928]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:32:35.229 --> 00:32:36.109]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:32:36.429 --> 00:32:47.155]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[00:33:14.193 --> 00:33:20.700]  All right, coming up, more of your phone calls, and then Russian experts says flu epidemic may kill over one million this year.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.862]  That's out of the Moscow News.
[00:33:24.163 --> 00:33:29.228]  More on the Homeland Security visiting toy stores for what they think might be patent infringement.
[00:33:29.248 --> 00:33:31.290]  It's all part of the infrastructure protection.
[00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:32.692]  That's their job, running our lives.
[00:33:33.192 --> 00:33:33.472]  Also...
[00:33:34.605 --> 00:33:35.025]  U.S.
[00:33:35.245 --> 00:33:42.187]  incapable of turning Iran into another Iraq, the First Minister says, this is from the Tehran Times, you better wake up.
[00:33:43.207 --> 00:33:44.548]  This is how the globalists play.
[00:33:45.068 --> 00:33:55.891]  They'll have an unpopular war, then there'll be a big terror attack, there'll be a national draft, and they'll use the American people to march in there and turn your country into a slag heap, you arrogant mullahs.
[00:33:56.311 --> 00:33:58.772]  So don't play into the globalists' hands, you fools.
[00:33:59.672 --> 00:34:00.252]  Continuing...
[00:34:01.457 --> 00:34:07.344]  Boston Herald, police peppered crowd, witnesses, superintendent, randomly fired pellets.
[00:34:07.765 --> 00:34:14.634]  They've now suspended some of the top cops who were on the ground because they're not supposed to just randomly fire rubber bullets at close range.
[00:34:15.779 --> 00:34:16.739]  They ought to be fired.
[00:34:16.779 --> 00:34:18.200]  They ought to be criminally charged.
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:22.141]  It turns out those commanding these operations were specially trained.
[00:34:22.161 --> 00:34:25.702]  They were actually certified as trainers with the weapons.
[00:34:25.742 --> 00:34:26.623]  They knew what they were doing.
[00:34:27.103 --> 00:34:29.523]  Also, transit moves ahead with RFID.
[00:34:29.543 --> 00:34:30.404]  A growing number of U.S.
[00:34:30.444 --> 00:34:40.187]  mass transit operators are giving a green light to contractors to put in fare collection systems that use RFID tracker chips.
[00:34:40.307 --> 00:34:41.707]  And an article we're going to cover.
[00:34:42.287 --> 00:34:44.348]  This is something you can take control of your life with.
[00:34:45.566 --> 00:34:46.387]  Do this at home.
[00:34:46.487 --> 00:34:47.788]  Test your microwave.
[00:34:47.948 --> 00:34:55.556]  Microwave water and then pour it over to seed and dirt in the windowsill and the seed will not sprout.
[00:34:56.197 --> 00:34:59.340]  But do it with regular water out of the tap and the seed will sprout.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.021]  It kills the water.
[00:35:01.041 --> 00:35:04.385]  It kills the molecular chains of the water.
[00:35:04.425 --> 00:35:05.306]  Makes it dead.
[00:35:05.726 --> 00:35:07.468]  Breaks up the nutrients that are in it.
[00:35:09.372 --> 00:35:10.693]  And we've known about this for a long time.
[00:35:10.713 --> 00:35:12.434]  You know, it's like cell phones are bad for you.
[00:35:12.774 --> 00:35:13.834]  We still all use them.
[00:35:14.214 --> 00:35:15.375]  Microwaves are bad for you.
[00:35:15.395 --> 00:35:16.215]  A lot of us still use them.
[00:35:16.576 --> 00:35:17.996]  Try not to use them, folks.
[00:35:18.797 --> 00:35:19.337]  Seriously.
[00:35:19.697 --> 00:35:21.838]  And now they've got a radiation that's even worse.
[00:35:22.478 --> 00:35:30.442]  And then the history of Halloween, this is out of, I've got four mainstream news articles admitting it's a satanic holiday, but saying go ahead and enjoy it.
[00:35:30.802 --> 00:35:34.824]  It's the worship of Satan, but, you know, it's still a lot of fun.
[00:35:35.405 --> 00:35:37.806]  And we have Victoria Collier
[00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:40.151]  Vote scam expert coming on.
[00:35:40.171 --> 00:35:44.374]  And we also have Tex Morris coming on to talk about the history of Halloween and a lot on the election.
[00:35:44.894 --> 00:35:47.916]  But just briefly here, I have made 11 films.
[00:35:47.936 --> 00:35:49.117]  The 11th film is out.
[00:35:49.757 --> 00:35:53.700]  It is American Dictators, and it's $19.95, almost two hours long.
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:57.102]  When you order each additional copy on DVD, it's only $5.95.
[00:35:59.215 --> 00:36:10.481]  We're original, you know, in the hard case with the color cover and it's such a high quality film exposing the staged election and how Bush and Kerry are cousins and the latest 9-11 developments, the latest police state information.
[00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:12.122]  It's a great new video.
[00:36:12.162 --> 00:36:12.803]  People love it.
[00:36:14.224 --> 00:36:16.185]  And each additional copy is only $5.95.
[00:36:16.225 --> 00:36:18.586]  So get two or three extra copies.
[00:36:18.626 --> 00:36:19.587]  Get ten extra copies.
[00:36:19.967 --> 00:36:21.868]  Give them as gifts to folks to wake them up.
[00:36:23.323 --> 00:36:24.507]  Also, I have my other films.
[00:36:24.527 --> 00:36:26.312]  A bunch of different specials we're offering there.
[00:36:26.332 --> 00:36:30.062]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror, Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[00:36:31.219 --> 00:36:34.000]  Matrix of Evil, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.320]  Got a bunch of different specials there.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:38.101]  So when you're on the website, be sure and look at those different specials.
[00:36:38.441 --> 00:36:39.962]  I carry a bunch of other videos and books.
[00:36:40.002 --> 00:36:41.222]  We offer specials on those.
[00:36:41.702 --> 00:36:50.245]  So when you're on Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, peruse the shopping cart, watch free clips of the films, read about the different specials, and decide which ones you want to order.

[00:36:56.216 --> 00:36:56.316]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:36:57.257 --> 00:37:05.641]  Give them a call, and you can ask questions there as well about different titles, different specials.
[00:37:05.661 --> 00:37:06.261]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:37:06.281 --> 00:37:06.981]  Or just write to me.
[00:37:07.001 --> 00:37:09.983]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:37:19.531 --> 00:37:22.093]  And don't forget PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[00:37:22.113 --> 00:37:26.617]  You can watch all the films in high-quality bandwidth or low-grade bandwidth if you've got a bad dial-up.
[00:37:27.077 --> 00:37:34.443]  PrisonPlanet.tv, all my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV reports, special text reports, all my best audio interviews.
[00:37:34.803 --> 00:37:36.044]  PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[00:37:38.647 --> 00:37:46.070]  Okay, all the news I mentioned, like Russian experts, this flu epidemic may kill over one billion this year, and other key information is coming up here in about three or four or five minutes.
[00:37:46.671 --> 00:38:05.179]  But first off, we're honored to have Ted Anderson, the owner of the Genesis Network, also the owner of Midas Resources, slashing prices again, despite the fact that gold is way up, and he literally is selling this at cost, he told me this morning, just because he wants to offer an occasional super special.
[00:38:06.316 --> 00:38:08.948]  That basically knocks out any known competition.
[00:38:09.872 --> 00:38:10.374]  And Ted...
[00:38:12.549 --> 00:38:15.970]  Put me down for some of these babies at this price, $10 Liberties.
[00:38:16.391 --> 00:38:19.212]  They're selling for $300, $280 most places.
[00:38:19.552 --> 00:38:23.173]  You're offering an insane deal at your cost.
[00:38:23.533 --> 00:38:29.756]  That's why the boss, not his brokers, will be answering the phone just doing this, this one-time deal.
[00:38:30.116 --> 00:38:31.496]  Ted, welcome to the show.
[00:38:31.676 --> 00:38:32.237]  Hey, Alex.
[00:38:32.297 --> 00:38:33.357]  It's great to be on again.
[00:38:33.397 --> 00:38:34.638]  You know, I love those videos.
[00:38:34.678 --> 00:38:37.839]  I always have people complimenting them, and that's just great.
[00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:53.330]  I'm glad to hear you've got a new one out there, and you're right, the $10 Liberty, what I had is my European buyer had a big group of them come in, and he wants to get rid of them, and I'm able to put them up there at $249 a piece.
[00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:55.452]  Now, mind you, Alex, gold is up today.
[00:38:55.492 --> 00:39:04.439]  We are at $427.40 again, and if you read that economic forecaster that Bob Chapman writes,
[00:39:05.126 --> 00:39:06.768]  He's talking about 480 gold.
[00:39:07.709 --> 00:39:14.396]  If we see gold punch over 430 here real soon, it'll be in the 450 range.
[00:39:14.416 --> 00:39:23.346]  Well, Ted, I bought gold three years ago, two years ago, a year ago from you, and the gold I bought three years ago has almost doubled its value.
[00:39:23.386 --> 00:39:25.308]  The gold I bought a year ago has gone up by about 30%.
[00:39:26.661 --> 00:39:28.182]  Yeah, it's been real strong.
[00:39:28.262 --> 00:39:30.682]  Obviously, the market's been real strong because we're sitting at $427.40.
[00:39:30.782 --> 00:39:34.524]  Well, I could invest in the stock market, though, and lose money.
[00:39:34.844 --> 00:39:37.945]  Oh, yeah, and lose your shirt, too, at this particular time.
[00:39:38.265 --> 00:39:42.147]  And then you're talking about buying gold in the range when it was in the $200s, and now it's in the $427 range.
[00:39:43.667 --> 00:39:48.093]  You know, oil is, we're paying $2.09 a gallon for gasoline up here.
[00:39:48.113 --> 00:39:49.835]  You know, there's a lot of commodities.
[00:39:49.855 --> 00:39:52.298]  I'm right next door to the refineries and I'm paying $1.90.
[00:39:52.639 --> 00:39:56.784]  Yeah, so I mean, that's obviously, the commodities market right now is real hot.
[00:39:56.824 --> 00:39:58.206]  The precious metals is real hot.
[00:39:58.246 --> 00:40:00.169]  The dollar is being pushed down in value.
[00:40:00.189 --> 00:40:01.971]  There's a lot of things that are cooking in the marketplace.
[00:40:01.971 --> 00:40:03.111]  And you're offering the gold.
[00:40:03.172 --> 00:40:06.293]  I mean, literally, you told me your brokers aren't getting a commission.
[00:40:06.313 --> 00:40:10.595]  A lot of times you'll kick in a little bit of profits to sponsor the show.
[00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:11.715]  There's none of that.
[00:40:11.795 --> 00:40:16.978]  You are literally selling these at your cost, which is pretty ridiculous.
[00:40:17.018 --> 00:40:22.360]  And you're doing this to just, well, get people a good deal and knock out all the competition.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:26.444]  Well, like I told you, Alex, in this particular case, it's just one of those things.
[00:40:26.644 --> 00:40:31.488]  I'll have to handle the orders myself because the brokers aren't going to get any action in the deal.
[00:40:32.049 --> 00:40:36.853]  And it's just at $2.49, that's ridiculously low for $10 gold pieces.
[00:40:37.154 --> 00:40:41.197]  It's like buying the equivalent of junk silver except for in the form of gold.
[00:40:41.558 --> 00:40:47.103]  As a matter of fact, when gold was at $3.50 an ounce, the $10 liberties were higher than this.
[00:40:47.563 --> 00:40:48.744]  Let me ask you a question, though.
[00:40:48.784 --> 00:40:50.465]  These also have a semi-numismatic.
[00:40:50.485 --> 00:40:52.066]  They also have collector value, correct?
[00:40:52.086 --> 00:40:58.050]  Oh, that's right, because a lot of these, you know, the majority of these are dating back in the 1800s, and a few in the early 1900s.
[00:40:58.090 --> 00:40:59.792]  These are the collector coins of the realm.
[00:41:00.172 --> 00:41:02.834]  These are the coins that are exempt from... All right, it's an insane deal.
[00:41:02.854 --> 00:41:03.574]  Give folks the number.
[00:41:03.834 --> 00:41:05.355]  Okay, here's how you get a hold of me.
[00:41:05.716 --> 00:41:06.236]  You dial 866...
[00:41:08.811 --> 00:41:14.154]  735-2471 And I'll give it to you again.
[00:41:14.415 --> 00:41:20.619]  It's 866-735-2471 And folks, take advantage of this offer because actually it's a pretty good group.
[00:41:20.639 --> 00:41:21.800]  But when they're gone, they're gone.
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:22.240]  So, you know...
[00:41:23.821 --> 00:41:31.273]  If you're looking at picking up gold at all, if you've been thinking about it, the market is right for it, and at that price, you just can't go wrong.
[00:41:31.313 --> 00:41:31.954]  Not at $249.
[00:41:32.234 --> 00:41:34.638]  Ted, will you save a few of those for me?
[00:41:34.858 --> 00:41:36.601]  I will set aside some of them for you.
[00:41:36.621 --> 00:41:38.424]  I know that people will be arm-wrestling for them, though.
[00:41:38.942 --> 00:41:42.686]  Well, I'll talk to you during the next break, or I know you're going to be on the phone.
[00:41:43.127 --> 00:41:44.368]  I can't buy a lot of them, but I want a few.
[00:41:44.748 --> 00:41:45.649]  I'll get some for you.
[00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:46.851]  I'll give folks that number again.
[00:41:47.091 --> 00:41:47.411]  It's 866-735-2471.
[00:41:47.431 --> 00:41:48.993]  Just ask for the $10 Liberty Special.
[00:41:49.013 --> 00:41:49.774]  Say that slowly, Ted.
[00:41:49.794 --> 00:41:49.834]  866-735-2471.
[00:41:57.637 --> 00:41:57.997]  24-71.
[00:41:59.598 --> 00:42:00.198]  All right, boss.
[00:42:00.218 --> 00:42:00.918]  Thanks for coming on.
[00:42:01.078 --> 00:42:01.698]  Not a problem.
[00:42:02.158 --> 00:42:03.659]  Folks, that is a really good deal.
[00:42:03.759 --> 00:42:04.259]  Great deal.
[00:42:04.319 --> 00:42:06.060]  Insane deal.
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:08.660]  Okay, believe me.
[00:42:08.901 --> 00:42:09.901]  Go check it out for yourself.
[00:42:09.941 --> 00:42:11.681]  Call somebody else and ask how much one of those is.
[00:42:13.362 --> 00:42:13.722]  It's nuts.
[00:42:13.742 --> 00:42:16.843]  All right, let's get back into the news and then back into your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:21.661]  I'm not trying to scare people.
[00:42:21.701 --> 00:42:22.821]  This is the Moscow News.
[00:42:23.482 --> 00:42:26.684]  I don't think this is the case, but they're saying it.
[00:42:27.184 --> 00:42:41.393]  We have the head of the British Medical Association, their head of ethics and science on yesterday, talking about all these threats and how they're increasing, and the probability is it's going to happen, as she said, in the next ten years when I asked the question.
[00:42:41.833 --> 00:42:43.014]  This is out of the Moscow News.
[00:42:43.974 --> 00:42:48.117]  Russian expert says flu epidemic may kill over one billion this year.
[00:42:48.797 --> 00:42:49.578]  That's ridiculous.
[00:42:50.842 --> 00:42:52.523]  But they're saying it, so we'll report it.
[00:42:52.963 --> 00:43:09.953]  The world is on the brink of a major flu epidemic, one that could claim more than a billion lives, the head of the Russian Virology Institute, Akademian Dmitry Luvov, said at a press conference organized by the RAA, Nova Scot News Agency, on Thursday.
[00:43:10.453 --> 00:43:15.255]  Up to one billion people could die around the whole world in six months, Luvov said.
[00:43:15.296 --> 00:43:19.638]  The expert did not give a time frame for the epidemic, but said it is highly probable...
[00:43:20.706 --> 00:43:21.946]  That it will start this year.
[00:43:22.827 --> 00:43:27.809]  We are half a step away from a worldwide pandemic catastrophe, said the academic.
[00:43:28.249 --> 00:43:32.470]  Now, we're 290 million people, and we have about 35,000 a year that die from the flu.
[00:43:33.271 --> 00:43:34.331]  The young, the old, the infirm.
[00:43:35.426 --> 00:43:37.388]  It says the Russian expert said the U.S.
[00:43:37.428 --> 00:43:44.155]  researchers possess data suggesting that if a pandemic hits, up to 700,000 people will fall ill in the United States.
[00:43:44.616 --> 00:43:51.023]  He said the population of the United States can be roughly compared to that of Russia, and thus the number of cases will be approximately the same.
[00:43:51.083 --> 00:43:51.883]  Russia's got about 265,000.
[00:43:52.104 --> 00:43:55.948]  Their population's actually going down about a million a year.
[00:43:56.448 --> 00:43:58.269]  They're dying off.
[00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:59.309]  They don't reproduce.
[00:43:59.369 --> 00:44:01.030]  They're just like every other European country.
[00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:08.433]  The Academian said the pandemic will most likely be the cause of the so-called bird flu strain.
[00:44:09.733 --> 00:44:13.735]  The death rate among those who contract this type of flu reaches 70%, he said.
[00:44:13.755 --> 00:44:15.696]  That's in Asia right now.
[00:44:16.076 --> 00:44:18.977]  The expert called for Russian authorities to prepare for the epidemic.
[00:44:19.237 --> 00:44:23.939]  The country will need a reserve of at least 300,000 hospital beds if an epidemic occurs.
[00:44:25.843 --> 00:44:26.924]  Breaks out, he said.
[00:44:26.944 --> 00:44:28.425]  Is that 300,000?
[00:44:28.465 --> 00:44:29.927]  Yeah, it's 300,000.
[00:44:30.767 --> 00:44:32.969]  That's pretty scary, my friends.
[00:44:34.811 --> 00:44:36.952]  The last pandemic, we don't know the true numbers.
[00:44:36.972 --> 00:44:38.153]  20 to 40 million.
[00:44:39.574 --> 00:44:41.616]  And that was back in 1918.
[00:44:41.696 --> 00:44:44.939]  And they've dug up the super flu from a dead body at the North Pole.
[00:44:45.039 --> 00:44:47.681]  And they're saying it could accidentally be released any minute.
[00:44:48.539 --> 00:44:55.463]  And I told you after they use terrorism to lock down everything, then they're going to have controlled releases of bioweapons to get rid of the population.
[00:44:55.943 --> 00:44:56.723]  I didn't say that.
[00:44:57.104 --> 00:44:58.544]  CIA documents said that.
[00:44:58.965 --> 00:45:01.306]  World Health Organization documents say that.
[00:45:01.806 --> 00:45:02.887]  Ted Turner said that.
[00:45:02.927 --> 00:45:03.947]  Prince Philip said that.
[00:45:04.247 --> 00:45:08.069]  We've got Henry Kissinger in 73 documents calling for the development of this.
[00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:11.151]  This is all declassified public stuff.
[00:45:11.994 --> 00:45:13.374]  I'm not the lunatic saying this.
[00:45:13.455 --> 00:45:18.876]  They're the lunatics out there promoting all this and imposing as our saviors while all this goes on.
[00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:22.117]  Meanwhile, Homeland Security is busy, according to the Associated Press.
[00:45:23.878 --> 00:45:25.038]  And they talked to the company.
[00:45:25.098 --> 00:45:27.099]  The Rubik's Cube patent is up.
[00:45:28.319 --> 00:45:35.261]  And so a Washington-based company manufactured these new knockoff Rubik's Cubes.
[00:45:35.822 --> 00:45:36.762]  The Magic Cube...
[00:45:37.685 --> 00:45:40.667]  Which is a legal copy of one of the popular toys.
[00:45:41.247 --> 00:45:42.808]  They didn't go to that company, though.
[00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:47.471]  They went and harassed Puffer Belly Toys.
[00:45:47.491 --> 00:45:58.737]  It's a toy store in Oregon, and they sent two Homeland Security officers and threatened her to stop selling the toy at the Puffer Belly store.
[00:45:59.398 --> 00:46:06.942]  So, again, race-specific bioweapons and all this stuff going on, and wide-open borders, but they're busy sending agents to Puffer Belly.
[00:46:08.746 --> 00:46:11.108]  Now here's arrogance, folks, and here's ignorance.
[00:46:11.348 --> 00:46:11.668]  U.S.
[00:46:11.728 --> 00:46:15.150]  incapable of turning Iran into another Iraq, Defense Minister said.
[00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:18.732]  This is out of the Tehran Times, official government mouthpiece.
[00:46:19.413 --> 00:46:27.798]  Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani said here on Wednesday that the United States is not powerful enough to turn Iran into another Iraq.
[00:46:29.631 --> 00:46:43.018]  He told reporters that the United States is pursuing its own interests through the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan, its military presence in the Persian Gulf, but Iran has taken the necessary measures to counter the aggressive U.S.
[00:46:43.098 --> 00:46:43.618]  policy.
[00:46:44.298 --> 00:46:49.561]  Iran follows a policy of deterrence, but its defense doctrine is subject to change, he asserted.
[00:46:50.638 --> 00:46:51.799]  And he said that he noted the U.S.
[00:46:51.819 --> 00:46:57.583]  officials intend to increase the scrub with their military presence in the region, so Iran could always try to upgrade its defense capabilities.
[00:46:58.183 --> 00:46:59.344]  Asked about rumors that the U.S.
[00:46:59.384 --> 00:47:03.207]  is eavesdropping on Iran from its borders, he said that any kind of espionage of the U.S.
[00:47:03.227 --> 00:47:06.910]  would be regarded as an act against the national interest of the Islamic Republic.
[00:47:08.331 --> 00:47:09.191]  In response to the U.S.
[00:47:09.231 --> 00:47:19.999]  Zionist lobby claims that Iran's missile capability is the threat to Europe, he stated that the Islamic Republic poses no threat to Europe, calling it a Zionist plan to encourage Europe animosity towards Iran.
[00:47:21.441 --> 00:47:43.722]  Iran, the globalists can blow up a city, or release smallpox, and then after they're done getting everything in order here, there will be millions of people lined up, there will be a draft, we will come in there, that is, the globalists controlling us, and we will smash you and kill you and crush you and crush anyone else, and they'll unfurl all the new super weapons they've got,
[00:47:44.569 --> 00:47:47.071]  And you are dead meat, you fools.
[00:47:47.091 --> 00:47:52.615]  You're like the Japanese when they had the ten-part plan our government did to get them to attack us.
[00:47:53.096 --> 00:47:56.418]  Had the Flying Tigers in China attacking the Japanese, cut off their oil.
[00:47:56.918 --> 00:47:59.680]  And Japan thought they were so tough, and our government played weak.
[00:48:00.541 --> 00:48:02.262]  And then had you play into it.
[00:48:03.864 --> 00:48:06.045]  The globalists play the same game over and over again.
[00:48:06.225 --> 00:48:07.226]  And are you going to buy that?
[00:48:08.827 --> 00:48:12.350]  And again, folks, did you know in 1953 that Iran was our ally?
[00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:13.651]  They kicked the Soviets out.
[00:48:15.444 --> 00:48:16.625]  They were our allies.
[00:48:17.245 --> 00:48:20.467]  They were anti-communist, pro-West, even pro-Israel.
[00:48:20.507 --> 00:48:21.087]  Did you know that?
[00:48:21.747 --> 00:48:28.131]  And our government got so greedy for all the oil because they were demanding that about 10% of the oil money go to the government and the people.
[00:48:28.151 --> 00:48:29.271]  And they said, no, we get it all.
[00:48:30.692 --> 00:48:35.555]  And the British encouraged us, so they sent Roosevelt's grandson there, who I've heard on tape admit all this.
[00:48:35.595 --> 00:48:36.295]  This is public.
[00:48:37.115 --> 00:48:38.296]  They even wrote books about it.
[00:48:38.476 --> 00:48:43.759]  They hired about 1,000 thugs and had them for two weeks riot and shoot and kill people in the streets and bomb mosques.
[00:48:44.566 --> 00:48:48.708]  Yelling up with the Prime Minister, up with communism, blaming it on him.
[00:48:49.348 --> 00:48:50.109]  Our government did this.
[00:48:50.129 --> 00:48:50.829]  This is now admitted.
[00:48:51.509 --> 00:49:09.718]  And then they had a little puppet Shaw, a little princeling, and had a hired thug group supposedly working for him, hired by our government, who, quote, cleaned up the streets from the other thug group our government hired, and then they overthrew him and put the Shaw in and set up torture camps and the rest of it, which then caused a counter-revolution, and then the Ayatollah Khomeini came in, and then we've had an enemy ever since.
[00:49:09.978 --> 00:49:12.339]  When we had a friend to begin with, but you were so greedy...
[00:49:12.879 --> 00:49:14.881]  You tried to throw them out and you successfully did so.
[00:49:15.702 --> 00:49:18.024]  Another example of problem, reaction, solution.
[00:49:19.105 --> 00:49:20.926]  Making enemies as fast as they can.
[00:49:21.367 --> 00:49:28.233]  Our government went in and murdered people, bombed people, machine gunned people for several weeks straight, blaming it on the Prime Minister.
[00:49:28.533 --> 00:49:34.298]  And now they had Roosevelt's grandson on NPR bragging how they went and did all this.
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:37.261]  Him admitting they did it.
[00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:43.112]  Well, bombing the mosque and machine gunning the people and blaming it on him worked quite well.
[00:49:43.693 --> 00:49:50.356]  I mean, just... Can we wait 50 years to hear them bragging about how they carried out 9-11?
[00:49:50.376 --> 00:49:52.557]  Don't worry, you probably will.
[00:49:52.877 --> 00:49:54.958]  Well, we did this because we recognize the threat.
[00:49:54.998 --> 00:49:58.439]  It never ends, people.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:02.101]  It never ends what these jokers are pulling.
[00:50:03.161 --> 00:50:04.342]  And I am so sick of it.
[00:50:06.092 --> 00:50:10.673]  We're going to come back and continue with your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:10.713 --> 00:50:12.473]  Callers, have your questions and comments ready.
[00:50:12.493 --> 00:50:14.594]  I'm going to move on to the next person because I want to get a lot of people in here.
[00:50:15.254 --> 00:50:16.414]  No guests in the next hour.
[00:50:16.454 --> 00:50:18.975]  Just calls and this huge stack of news.
[00:50:18.995 --> 00:50:21.235]  They're doing a pretty good job covering all the news.
[00:50:22.196 --> 00:50:25.716]  I'm actually on track right now to cover it all by the time the broadcast ends.
[00:50:26.076 --> 00:50:30.157]  In the third hour, we've got Victoria Collier coming on for 30 minutes to talk about election fraud.
[00:50:30.497 --> 00:50:32.638]  And Tex Mars to talk about the true history of Halloween.
[00:50:33.933 --> 00:50:37.456]  Of course, Tex was a kooky guy ten years ago talking about how it was a satanic holiday.
[00:50:37.896 --> 00:50:41.680]  Now it's in the Associated Press, Reuters, BBC, Discovery Channel.
[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:46.684]  I've got all these news articles saying, yes, it's a human sacrifice holiday, and your children simulate that.
[00:50:47.705 --> 00:50:49.627]  So we'll talk about that when we get back.
[00:50:50.287 --> 00:50:51.128]  Oh, but it's fun.
[00:50:51.168 --> 00:50:52.009]  You know you want to do it.
[00:50:52.429 --> 00:50:56.993]  PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowars.com, Infowars.net.
[00:50:58.294 --> 00:50:58.875]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:03.092]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.232 --> 00:51:06.315]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.435 --> 00:51:10.339]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.399 --> 00:51:14.623]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:51:14.983 --> 00:51:18.747]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.887 --> 00:51:20.769]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:20.869 --> 00:51:21.169]  Liable.
[00:51:21.289 --> 00:51:24.170]  The police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:28.933]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.093 --> 00:51:32.154]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.314 --> 00:51:35.156]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.676 --> 00:51:41.799]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.319 --> 00:51:44.161]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[00:52:01.218 --> 00:52:04.782]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:52:04.822 --> 00:52:05.342]  are located?
[00:52:05.543 --> 00:52:08.926]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:52:09.147 --> 00:52:13.852]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:16.516]  Coming up in the next hour, I'm going to play this little five-minute piece of Jon Stewart on Crossfire and kind of analyze the whole left-for-right debate, the false paradigm expanding out from there.
[00:54:16.536 --> 00:54:25.980]  And I'll replay Bush, the audio of him kind of getting mad at his staff and flipping them off and actually looking like he was going insane on video.
[00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:33.662]  And then we'll also get into some of the sinister activities of John Kerry right now and how I predict George Bush will be your next president.
[00:54:34.022 --> 00:54:37.863]  But what's open for debate is, are we going to have a contested election?
[00:54:37.903 --> 00:54:39.243]  I think it's going that direction.
[00:54:39.623 --> 00:54:44.024]  Just a program note, this show just doesn't go out on the AM and FM dial or the Internet or satellite.
[00:54:44.444 --> 00:54:49.725]  It's also on the big blowtorch WWCR, 100,000 watts of global shortwave.
[00:54:50.506 --> 00:54:53.766]  Starting Monday, folks, during the day, you will hear us on a new frequency, 9.985.
[00:54:58.174 --> 00:55:02.916]  WWCR did a great job of two and a half weeks ago telling me about this, and I didn't start telling people until a few days ago.
[00:55:03.936 --> 00:55:04.676]  So do me a favor.
[00:55:04.716 --> 00:55:13.819]  Call into all the other shows, especially all the other phony neocon conspiracy shows that are on shortwave, and tell them about Alex Jones at 9.985.
[00:55:13.859 --> 00:55:14.259]  That's a favor.
[00:55:14.279 --> 00:55:14.860]  9.985 Monday, 11 to 2.
[00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:14.860]  9.985.
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:14.860]  9.985. 9.985.
[00:55:23.174 --> 00:55:30.238]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Illinois and Mike Panch and many, many others that are holding.
[00:55:30.698 --> 00:55:31.318]  Go ahead, Chris.
[00:55:31.558 --> 00:55:32.079]  Hi, Alex.
[00:55:32.239 --> 00:55:36.841]  I just want to say that we think the world of you and Tex Myers, and you're on our prayer list every day.
[00:55:36.861 --> 00:55:37.962]  You know what?
[00:55:38.902 --> 00:55:42.644]  To steal the comments of Bush, but I've actually said this before, I can feel it.
[00:55:44.361 --> 00:55:51.446]  As much as he can feel the prayers, they're probably causing him pain, but I can feel your prayers and I want to thank you.
[00:55:51.846 --> 00:55:52.146]  Okay.
[00:55:53.167 --> 00:56:01.212]  You know, a couple of days ago you were talking with some of your guests about the fact that we have to find out what's going on.
[00:56:01.272 --> 00:56:03.394]  It's our responsibility to know things.
[00:56:04.074 --> 00:56:05.255]  And I agree, totally.
[00:56:06.356 --> 00:56:08.737]  And I don't even know how to put this.
[00:56:10.478 --> 00:56:12.860]  Don't you think that it's up to
[00:56:13.368 --> 00:56:17.110]  To groups that we depend on also to give us the right information.
[00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:19.371]  For example, we can't do everything.
[00:56:19.411 --> 00:56:27.915]  I mean, I trust you, and I listen to you, and so, you know, even though I get all kinds of other information, I still mainly go on what you say.
[00:56:28.315 --> 00:56:29.955]  People like you text Mars and so on.
[00:56:30.496 --> 00:56:42.121]  But now, and I'm not dissing anybody, because I belong to this group, GOA, but they sent out a mailer asking us to support Marilyn Musgrave.
[00:56:42.930 --> 00:56:52.676]  And like I say, I can't look everything up every day and so on, so that's a group that I appreciate, and so I did send in some money to support.
[00:56:53.036 --> 00:56:56.998]  Well, then I pick up the American Free Press, and what does it say?
[00:56:57.519 --> 00:57:01.521]  Paid politicians targeting Christian boycott of Israel.
[00:57:02.402 --> 00:57:04.763]  And Marilyn Musgrave is supporting this.
[00:57:05.273 --> 00:57:15.655]  Now, my question is, Alex, don't you think that groups that we trust and so on should be a little bit more discerning about what they... Well, see, this is what happens with gun owners.
[00:57:16.474 --> 00:57:17.995]  They pick one issue.
[00:57:18.095 --> 00:57:19.615]  Exactly what they told me.
[00:57:19.856 --> 00:57:24.397]  And so he's good on that, and so they overall see him as good.
[00:57:24.417 --> 00:57:28.459]  And wouldn't you rather have Musgrave than some Democrat who will go after your guns?
[00:57:28.479 --> 00:57:30.220]  See, here's my point.
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:37.483]  How can she be a supporter of one right while trying to take another right away?
[00:57:37.903 --> 00:57:39.224]  No, I totally agree with you.
[00:57:39.504 --> 00:57:41.565]  I mean, look, gun owners isn't perfect.
[00:57:41.585 --> 00:57:43.306]  I think they're one of the best gun groups out there.
[00:57:43.386 --> 00:57:44.106]  I belong to them.
[00:57:45.066 --> 00:57:45.587]  You know what I mean?
[00:57:45.987 --> 00:57:54.298]  Okay, so anyway, I called the office and, you know, explained things to the one that answers the phone that some of these people, you wonder why they're answering the phone.
[00:57:54.699 --> 00:58:00.226]  But at any rate, I get a call back and it's, well, we are one, it has nothing to do with guns.
[00:58:00.246 --> 00:58:02.129]  Yeah, but you know, that's not right.
[00:58:03.211 --> 00:58:03.771]  In my opinion.
[00:58:04.191 --> 00:58:05.832]  I understand, but it's the strategy.
[00:58:05.872 --> 00:58:08.692]  They can barely stop just the gun situations.
[00:58:09.073 --> 00:58:11.613]  They can barely just keep their eyes on that legislation.
[00:58:12.093 --> 00:58:20.636]  Imagine, you know, 400-something members of Congress and literally hundreds of thousands of pieces of legislation a year out of Washington and regulations.
[00:58:20.716 --> 00:58:23.676]  It's a full-time job just keeping track of that.
[00:58:23.716 --> 00:58:24.977]  But I understand what you're saying.
[00:58:25.957 --> 00:58:28.258]  I mean, I understand what you're saying, but I also see what they're saying.
[00:58:28.438 --> 00:58:28.698]  Yeah.
[00:58:29.098 --> 00:58:30.058]  Oh, one other thing, too.
[00:58:30.098 --> 00:58:30.838]  I'm sitting here reading.
[00:58:31.178 --> 00:58:34.059]  We have a local paper that covers thousands of people.
[00:58:34.399 --> 00:58:36.000]  And I just caught my eye.
[00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:38.520]  Brain scan merged with politics.
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:42.741]  They're going to do research on what's the difference in brains of Republicans and Democrats.
[00:58:42.781 --> 00:58:45.742]  Well, they've been doing this for at least ten years.
[00:58:45.782 --> 00:58:48.223]  They shut you down in front of ads and check your brain waves.
[00:58:48.243 --> 00:58:48.863]  Thanks for the call.
[00:58:48.883 --> 00:58:49.623]  Second hour coming up.
[00:58:57.889 --> 00:58:58.550]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:00.251]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.971 --> 00:59:02.072]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.733 --> 00:59:03.573]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.314 --> 00:59:05.195]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.215 --> 00:59:09.758]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.058 --> 00:59:14.201]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.803 --> 00:59:21.347]  All right, my friends, now into hour number two of this October 29, 2004 worldwide broadcast, Against Tyranny.
[00:59:25.931 --> 00:59:40.925]  And of course, I'll be here Monday and Tuesday covering it as well, and I'm going to be doing political analysis for Coast to Coast AM both nights, three hours on Wednesday night, a couple segments on Tuesday night.
[00:59:40.945 --> 00:59:41.666]  That's a big deal.
[00:59:41.686 --> 00:59:42.627]  I'm very thankful for that.
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:49.263]  New shortwave frequency for the shortwave listeners of this broadcast who don't listen on AM or FM or Internet.
[00:59:49.923 --> 00:59:56.386]  Starting next week, next Monday, 11 to 2 during the day central, you'll listen to this show on the shortwave at 9.985.
[00:59:56.426 --> 00:59:56.386]  9.985.
[00:59:56.906 --> 01:00:01.729]  I'm about to go to Michael and Pam and Chad and John and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:00:01.749 --> 01:00:10.133]  Then I'm going to get more into the campaign and air this clip people have been asking for when Jon Stewart of The Daily Show was on Crossfire, got quite heated.
[01:00:11.016 --> 01:00:14.857]  We've edited out one of his low-level mild expletives.
[01:00:16.077 --> 01:00:19.338]  But we're going to go into the whole fake left-right paradigm with this.
[01:00:20.218 --> 01:00:29.680]  Also, they've now done studies that microwaves, just how bad it is for your food, breaking up the ring structures and how the vitamins are all connected into each other.
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:33.901]  We'll be getting into that and more on Homeland Security.
[01:00:34.301 --> 01:00:35.301]  Rating a toy store.
[01:00:35.521 --> 01:00:35.761]  Yes.
[01:00:36.818 --> 01:00:39.919]  High-level situation, plus these new fake terror alerts.
[01:00:40.359 --> 01:00:42.340]  White guys with New Jersey accents.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:44.901]  Yeah, Al Kine is going to get you, Mac.
[01:00:45.921 --> 01:00:50.283]  So we'll be talking about that, too, as well.
[01:00:50.923 --> 01:00:52.604]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michael.
[01:00:53.804 --> 01:00:54.985]  Mike in Illinois.
[01:00:55.185 --> 01:00:55.705]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:00:56.105 --> 01:01:01.487]  Alex, listen, I want to tell you, I was out taking my garbage out yesterday, taking the garbage cans in from out by the street.
[01:01:02.288 --> 01:01:02.688]  We're good.
[01:01:25.532 --> 01:01:26.713]  The police came to the house.
[01:01:26.833 --> 01:01:27.873]  How bad was the bite?
[01:01:28.353 --> 01:01:29.354]  It wasn't that bad.
[01:01:29.534 --> 01:01:30.274]  Well, let me stop you.
[01:01:30.774 --> 01:01:33.335]  Kids do this, folks, and then they should be disciplined.
[01:01:33.695 --> 01:01:36.557]  Children have always acted like little out-of-control puppy dogs.
[01:01:36.597 --> 01:01:38.217]  You know, your puppy will soft-bite you.
[01:01:38.717 --> 01:01:43.940]  This type of stuff goes on, and then now these people will never be out of the system.
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:47.041]  People need to stop calling the cops at every drop of the hat.
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:48.361]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:01:48.561 --> 01:01:53.865]  And she said she was upset, but now DCFS is involved because she's licensed through the state of Illinois.
[01:01:53.885 --> 01:02:00.271]  In Illinois, the state law is if you have more than three children, you have to be licensed to do daycare in your house.
[01:02:00.471 --> 01:02:04.514]  So she said DCFS is coming today to inspect the house.
[01:02:05.235 --> 01:02:09.938]  And I'm telling you, Alex, I tried witnessing... Well, why would this woman call the police?
[01:02:10.379 --> 01:02:16.504]  Because she said she wanted a police report documented, and now she took her child out of that house, and she said she's going to have this woman sued.
[01:02:18.323 --> 01:02:19.524]  And it's just ridiculous, Alex.
[01:02:19.544 --> 01:02:29.268]  You know, people, not just the government, Alex, but people are so brainwashed that, you know, we live in a lawsuit-happy society, and if you sneeze or look at someone the wrong way, I'm going to sue you, buddy.
[01:02:29.288 --> 01:02:37.151]  Well, I mean, you know, my point is, is that maybe 20 years ago, 30 years ago, we were too lenient, but now it's gone too far the other direction.
[01:02:37.171 --> 01:02:41.893]  I mean, I remember, I mean, remember it used to, there was a fist fight,
[01:02:43.128 --> 01:02:45.450]  Uh, people didn't usually call the police.
[01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:48.012]  They just said, all right, stop it, and they'd pull people off each other.
[01:02:48.472 --> 01:02:49.633]  And that's how people handled it.
[01:02:49.653 --> 01:02:52.635]  Well, now they call the police on you, and people are cowardly.
[01:02:52.675 --> 01:02:54.116]  People just use guns instead.
[01:02:54.136 --> 01:02:57.758]  Right, and they use domestic, you know, then you're arrested for domestic battery or whatever.
[01:02:57.779 --> 01:03:00.280]  You're arrested for just punching somebody or hitting somebody the wrong way.
[01:03:00.961 --> 01:03:06.204]  But this woman, what she told me, Alex, this is the one thing I wanted to tell you, which is the woman who owns the house... Let me just say this.
[01:03:06.304 --> 01:03:08.346]  John Wayne would have been in jail a lot, because...
[01:03:09.247 --> 01:03:10.308]  We're good to go.
[01:03:10.368 --> 01:03:11.189]  We're good to go.
[01:03:23.146 --> 01:03:29.028]  You knock somebody upside the head now, you better have it on video that they hit you first or you're going to the pen.
[01:03:29.308 --> 01:03:30.189]  But go ahead, sir.
[01:03:30.889 --> 01:03:33.610]  Well, anyway, so the woman said she called the police.
[01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:39.692]  She finally confessed because she wanted to make sure it wasn't the actual lady who takes care of the kids that bit her.
[01:03:40.392 --> 01:03:41.933]  She wanted the bite marks measured.
[01:03:43.113 --> 01:03:44.313]  Well, I mean, you know.
[01:03:44.433 --> 01:03:48.275]  But Alex, the police were real, they held her aside and they were real rough with her.
[01:03:48.335 --> 01:03:50.316]  She told me the one cop looked like he was going to cuff her.
[01:03:50.456 --> 01:03:51.376]  I want to hear more about this.
[01:03:53.436 --> 01:03:57.798]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.

[01:05:52.873 --> 01:05:53.553]  Hi, I'm Ron.
[01:05:53.573 --> 01:05:56.075]  I'm taking collagen aid from Thinman Vigor.
[01:05:56.355 --> 01:05:59.637]  And I have taken 20 pounds off and 6 inches off my waist.
[01:05:59.857 --> 01:06:00.237]  It works.
[01:06:00.397 --> 01:06:02.318]  I've gone down 35 pounds!
[01:06:03.319 --> 01:06:09.062]  And I've got energy and vitality that I never dreamed that I would ever have again.
[01:06:09.162 --> 01:06:12.944]  I'm going to be 51 years old, and I feel as good as I did when I was 35.
[01:06:13.844 --> 01:06:14.925]  And I look that good, too.
[01:06:15.465 --> 01:06:16.246]  That's great!
[01:06:16.486 --> 01:06:17.507]  You can lose weight, too.

[01:06:42.784 --> 01:06:43.384]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[01:06:43.424 --> 01:06:43.624]  Call today.
[01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:56.410]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.971 --> 01:06:59.811]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:59.971 --> 01:07:14.374]  Alright, I said I want to go to these calls quick, and of course I'm belaboring issues with callers because they bring up such interesting information.
[01:07:16.474 --> 01:07:23.856]  Mike in Illinois saw police cars two doors down at his neighbor's house, and like a good citizen, a good neighbor, he went down later to see what happened.
[01:07:24.522 --> 01:07:40.705]  There was a daycare there with a couple kids, and the person running the daycare's child bit another child, which is a problem, and the child should be disciplined, and a problem with society now is children are not disciplined, but that's a pretty common occurrence, and Mike, you were saying that the bite was not very bad?
[01:07:40.745 --> 01:07:42.286]  I mean, how bad was it?
[01:07:42.506 --> 01:07:48.787]  She said it just, one of the teeth, there's four teeth marks in one of them, the eye teeth, whatever you call it, punctured the skin, but the rest didn't.
[01:07:49.267 --> 01:07:54.148]  Well, that is somewhat serious, but the parent should have come
[01:07:55.047 --> 01:07:56.948]  And, you know, talked it over.
[01:07:57.008 --> 01:07:59.670]  I mean, used to, that's what would happen, and there'd still be a record of it.
[01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:06.374]  But instead, now she's called the police and then, as you said, wanted to have the bite marks measured to make sure it wasn't the parent.
[01:08:07.215 --> 01:08:11.177]  And, you know what, unfortunately, it'll probably come back on that lady who did that.
[01:08:11.677 --> 01:08:16.180]  Because in a society where people do this, I mean, kids do bad things, folks.
[01:08:18.644 --> 01:08:22.406]  All this does is get children into the system, and boy, this lady's really facing something now.
[01:08:22.706 --> 01:08:27.428]  But you were saying when we hit the last break that the police were kind of being rough with her?
[01:08:27.468 --> 01:08:33.791]  The one cop, the second guy that came there, her son came home from school yesterday, and he's a teenager, and they're good people.
[01:08:34.371 --> 01:08:36.092]  Wait a minute, was it a teenager that bit the child?
[01:08:36.192 --> 01:08:36.892]  No, no, no, no.
[01:08:37.092 --> 01:08:37.833]  Because it was.
[01:08:37.913 --> 01:08:38.693]  I would call the cops.
[01:08:38.713 --> 01:08:40.654]  No, no, this was a four-year-old biting a three-year-old.
[01:08:41.768 --> 01:08:43.689]  No, the four-year-old wasn't her child either.
[01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:45.469]  It was another child she's watching.
[01:08:46.150 --> 01:08:48.810]  Oh, well that's... and so now she's in trouble.
[01:08:49.230 --> 01:08:50.631]  Well, now the police... here's what happened.
[01:08:50.651 --> 01:08:53.572]  So the son got home and the police questioned him, who are you?
[01:08:54.052 --> 01:08:56.753]  And the kid was kind of, I guess, a smart aleck.
[01:08:56.773 --> 01:08:57.933]  He said, I live here.
[01:08:57.953 --> 01:08:58.833]  I'm going up to my room.
[01:08:58.853 --> 01:09:00.374]  The cop said, you stay right here.
[01:09:00.394 --> 01:09:02.395]  This is in his own house, Alex.
[01:09:02.475 --> 01:09:03.515]  This is what I'm talking about.
[01:09:04.242 --> 01:09:07.525]  The whole point of what I'm trying to say, Alex, is I got all your videos.
[01:09:07.665 --> 01:09:08.546]  I witness to people.
[01:09:09.166 --> 01:09:10.968]  I give copies of your videos out to people.
[01:09:11.068 --> 01:09:12.909]  And this is why we have to educate the public.
[01:09:12.969 --> 01:09:16.392]  Because I tried to tell this lady last summer.
[01:09:16.432 --> 01:09:17.493]  I talked to her and her husband.
[01:09:17.513 --> 01:09:19.755]  And she wrote me off as a crackpot.
[01:09:19.795 --> 01:09:22.637]  She says, oh, you believe anything you see on the Internet, don't you?
[01:09:22.677 --> 01:09:23.818]  And I gave her your website.
[01:09:23.838 --> 01:09:24.358]  She went to it.
[01:09:24.378 --> 01:09:24.999]  She didn't believe it.
[01:09:25.663 --> 01:09:32.446]  And now, I told her, yesterday she said to me, or today she said to me, I want to know more information about what you're talking about.
[01:09:32.546 --> 01:09:40.690]  Now, because she's been victimized by the police and she sees the brutality and how rough they are, he pushed her son against the wall when he tried to go up to his room.
[01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:44.571]  Because they tried to act like it was a crime scene, Alex.
[01:09:44.651 --> 01:09:46.492]  It's just ridiculous the way these police are.
[01:09:46.932 --> 01:09:48.653]  No, I hear you and I appreciate the call, Mike.
[01:09:48.773 --> 01:09:52.315]  Look, we've gone from 1,300,000 people in prison...
[01:09:56.067 --> 01:09:57.307]  It's coming up on 10 years.
[01:09:58.248 --> 01:10:00.328]  10 years ago you had 1.3 million in prison.
[01:10:01.709 --> 01:10:03.469]  Now it's over 7 million.
[01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:06.430]  And it's tracking to even be higher.
[01:10:08.451 --> 01:10:09.851]  And they're only building more prisons.
[01:10:10.192 --> 01:10:18.494]  And the prisons are owned by the same private military industrial complex that brings in the narcotics that is basically capturing us to be their slaves.
[01:10:19.034 --> 01:10:20.375]  It's human history repeating itself.
[01:10:20.895 --> 01:10:23.816]  And so they're teaching the police zero tolerance for everything.
[01:10:24.611 --> 01:10:26.212]  To get people into the system.
[01:10:27.853 --> 01:10:29.413]  And folks better realize this.
[01:10:30.274 --> 01:10:32.355]  They've got to put somebody in these prisons.
[01:10:34.036 --> 01:10:36.217]  Let's go ahead and talk to Pam in New Mexico.
[01:10:36.297 --> 01:10:37.197]  Pam, you're on the air.
[01:10:37.237 --> 01:10:37.698]  Go ahead.
[01:10:37.718 --> 01:10:39.538]  Hi, Alex.
[01:10:40.179 --> 01:10:46.922]  You had two guests on your show in the last two days talking about voter fraud.
[01:10:47.342 --> 01:10:47.602]  Yes.
[01:10:47.943 --> 01:10:48.083]  And...
[01:10:49.289 --> 01:10:55.171]  And they talked about the dirty tricks that, especially Greg Palast, about the dirty tricks that are being played.
[01:10:55.892 --> 01:10:57.712]  And it's all over the news, too.
[01:10:57.792 --> 01:11:02.374]  I mean, Newsweek had an article, but they play it down mostly.
[01:11:02.954 --> 01:11:12.578]  However, I think that because of these dirty tricks that are being played, I think Bush is going to win, because otherwise he wouldn't bother to do all this.
[01:11:13.379 --> 01:11:16.640]  So there will be a mass protest
[01:11:17.552 --> 01:11:20.675]  I think people will take to the streets in great numbers.
[01:11:21.475 --> 01:11:28.721]  And I've been reading about all these concentrations, these FEMA concentration camps that they have all over the country.
[01:11:29.222 --> 01:11:37.228]  And I'm worried that the people that protest the fraudulent election will be put in these concentration camps.
[01:11:37.268 --> 01:11:46.856]  They'll probably keep on with their dirty tricks and hire provocateurs, thugs, to make the protests look like they're violent.
[01:11:47.615 --> 01:12:05.831]  And people will be arrested, and I'm just worried that it's going to be a little harder to get out of those concentration camps all over the country than it was to get out of the Pier 51 that they had at the Republican National Convention when they arrested over a thousand people.
[01:12:06.512 --> 01:12:08.734]  I'm wondering what your thoughts are on that.
[01:12:09.134 --> 01:12:13.378]  Well, number one, the Democrats are out stealing and manipulating, too.
[01:12:14.523 --> 01:12:16.044]  And so you ask, why does Bush do it?
[01:12:16.084 --> 01:12:17.825]  Well, because... Why do the Democrats do it?
[01:12:17.865 --> 01:12:19.246]  Well, because the other side's going to do it.
[01:12:19.606 --> 01:12:20.886]  This becomes part of the game.
[01:12:21.387 --> 01:12:30.652]  The Republicans are more centralized by knocking people off voter rolls, by having electronic voting machines that they control, with company chiefs saying we're going to steal elections.
[01:12:30.692 --> 01:12:31.632]  I mean, this is all public.
[01:12:32.493 --> 01:12:38.516]  And then the Democrats are good at registering dead people, or registering twice, or registering illegal aliens.
[01:12:39.196 --> 01:12:42.819]  And so you have two different levels of election fraud going on.
[01:12:43.019 --> 01:12:49.405]  And yeah, by the time you hear about it on ABC Nightly News or Fox News or NPR, it's, oh, there's been a few mistakes.
[01:12:49.805 --> 01:12:52.908]  Oh, people don't know how to use the computers.
[01:12:53.308 --> 01:12:54.689]  Well, no, the computers are crashing.
[01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:55.870]  The computers are flipping numbers.
[01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:58.832]  The computers are a fraud by design.
[01:12:59.013 --> 01:13:00.474]  And we've proven this time and time again.
[01:13:01.425 --> 01:13:04.651]  But no, I don't think they're going to put everybody in camps after the election.
[01:13:05.353 --> 01:13:12.307]  They may arrest thousands of people in big cities if there's riots or any provocateur activity and put you in a center for a week or so.
[01:13:13.385 --> 01:13:15.086]  I wouldn't call those concentration camps.
[01:13:15.146 --> 01:13:18.006]  I'd call them internment facilities or emergency internment facilities.
[01:13:18.146 --> 01:13:31.050]  But the government is openly preparing for martial law, gearing up federalization of local police departments, gearing up to bring the military in after a major catastrophic or group of catastrophic terror attacks.
[01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:37.312]  And so that mindset and this worldview and this system is being set up.
[01:13:37.652 --> 01:13:41.333]  And I would say that will come after the election sometime next year, maybe the next year.
[01:13:41.913 --> 01:13:42.053]  Mm-hmm.
[01:13:42.073 --> 01:13:42.474]  Well, I saw...
[01:13:58.957 --> 01:14:03.778]  An email that a friend sent me about all the FEMA concentration camps all over the country.
[01:14:03.798 --> 01:14:05.038]  I wondered if you'd seen that.
[01:14:05.098 --> 01:14:07.619]  Well, I don't really go off someone's email.
[01:14:07.659 --> 01:14:13.761]  I mean, I can go off Newsmax, Associated Press, the Army's own website, C-SPAN interviews, public statements.
[01:14:14.581 --> 01:14:18.742]  They have built, just in the last few years, three one-million-person camps.
[01:14:19.282 --> 01:14:21.582]  Before that, they have FEMA camps all over the country.
[01:14:22.022 --> 01:14:27.984]  Now, they're just huge barbed wire enclosures with portable buildings with bars on the windows.
[01:14:28.624 --> 01:14:29.925]  Well, this was on a blog or something.
[01:14:29.945 --> 01:14:31.747]  Well, what did it say?
[01:14:31.767 --> 01:14:31.887]  I mean...
[01:14:45.077 --> 01:14:50.880]  It just said there are... Because concentration camps are important enough to actually go get the documents.
[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:52.521]  That's why I've written a book about it.
[01:14:52.781 --> 01:14:53.702]  I've made films about it.
[01:14:53.742 --> 01:14:54.562]  I have video of it.
[01:14:54.802 --> 01:14:55.783]  I have proofs admitting it.
[01:14:55.823 --> 01:14:56.764]  I have the documents.
[01:14:57.144 --> 01:14:58.524]  I have where you can get the documents.
[01:15:00.065 --> 01:15:02.167]  But what's the blog say?
[01:15:02.467 --> 01:15:05.228]  They mention every state.
[01:15:05.588 --> 01:15:08.290]  They list every state that has these...
[01:15:08.866 --> 01:15:11.067]  Installations all over the country.
[01:15:11.227 --> 01:15:13.889]  Hey, Pam, I appreciate your call, and I understand your concern.
[01:15:13.929 --> 01:15:15.450]  Let me try to elaborate on this.
[01:15:17.371 --> 01:15:20.152]  We have, with great power comes great responsibility.
[01:15:21.933 --> 01:15:36.581]  And just because the media lies, or twists, or absconds, or lies by omission, or spins, doesn't then mean that all the alternative news is telling the truth either.
[01:15:38.328 --> 01:15:40.710]  You know, I won't get into, did we land on the moon?
[01:15:41.850 --> 01:15:44.132]  Because from my study, we did.
[01:15:45.933 --> 01:15:57.800]  And so what they do is they go then disprove the people that say that we didn't go to the moon, and then imply everybody that says we didn't go to the moon are conspiracy theorists, therefore all other conspiracies don't exist.
[01:15:59.501 --> 01:16:02.263]  Well, it's a little bit more sophisticated with the concentration camps.
[01:16:03.624 --> 01:16:06.886]  People run around and put out these lists where everything in the world is a camp.
[01:16:07.006 --> 01:16:10.328]  Then the media goes and investigates and it's indeed not a camp.
[01:16:10.968 --> 01:16:12.649]  Then they go, oh, see, there's no camps.
[01:16:14.050 --> 01:16:21.694]  Instead of the bulk of the information about camps on the web, we even have an area on InfoWars with all mainstream news about camps.
[01:16:22.335 --> 01:16:27.778]  But it seems like, I'm not talking about you, Pam, but most people who are into this stuff don't spend any time talking about the real camps.
[01:16:27.838 --> 01:16:31.000]  It's all about guillotines and mobile trucks and
[01:16:31.832 --> 01:16:34.933]  Box cars and underground execution centers.
[01:16:36.933 --> 01:16:43.015]  Instead of the fact that we've gone from 1.3 million in prison to 7 million in prison, I mean, what is that?
[01:16:43.555 --> 01:16:44.455]  These are camps.
[01:16:45.735 --> 01:16:48.156]  Most of the people in there are either innocent or non-violent.
[01:16:50.897 --> 01:16:52.377]  So there's your camps right there.
[01:16:53.397 --> 01:16:55.858]  But we have the purchase orders for the three one million man camps.
[01:16:55.898 --> 01:16:56.318]  They have the...
[01:16:58.456 --> 01:17:02.098]  They have the emergency contingencies bill in England for the camps there.
[01:17:02.138 --> 01:17:02.678]  That's admitted.
[01:17:02.698 --> 01:17:03.999]  BBC, London Telegraph.
[01:17:05.359 --> 01:17:10.081]  So I suggest folks who want to know about the camps, well, let me take my film to takeover.
[01:17:10.321 --> 01:17:18.645]  I have local Fox News footage and then our own footage of them going, here is the old 747 hangar with bolts and chains and barbed wire inside and porta-potties.
[01:17:19.646 --> 01:17:22.747]  And if there's ever a civil emergency, we're going to put you all in here.
[01:17:23.628 --> 01:17:24.408]  Now that's a camp.
[01:17:25.914 --> 01:17:29.475]  And then you go to New York, and they've got an old bus terminal, giant building.
[01:17:29.495 --> 01:17:31.836]  They put 2,000 people in it and run buses inside.
[01:17:31.876 --> 01:17:34.697]  Everybody starts vomiting, and there's bar-bar inside and port-a-potties.
[01:17:35.017 --> 01:17:36.657]  Every major city's got one of those.
[01:17:38.998 --> 01:17:43.419]  But again, the so-called patriots out there will not talk about it for your life.
[01:17:43.579 --> 01:17:47.901]  They will only talk about guillotines and mobile trucks that no one's ever gotten a photo of.
[01:17:50.181 --> 01:17:51.802]  So are they going to put us in all these camps?
[01:17:51.862 --> 01:17:52.442]  They'd love to.
[01:17:53.396 --> 01:17:59.660]  That's why they got Bill O'Reilly and Michelle Malkin and Michael Weiner, I mean Savage, out there saying how great all this is.
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:04.843]  And the Deputy Attorney General of California, Mr. Calhoun, is promoting it in the major papers.
[01:18:05.443 --> 01:18:08.405]  He says, disagree with the government, that-age terrorists, you should be put in a prison.
[01:18:08.885 --> 01:18:11.306]  Savage says they should be forced laborers to pay for their food.
[01:18:11.346 --> 01:18:12.427]  You know, how dare I pay for them?
[01:18:13.207 --> 01:18:14.428]  So this is all being introduced.
[01:18:14.488 --> 01:18:15.609]  Torture is being introduced.
[01:18:16.069 --> 01:18:17.710]  We're being conditioned to accept all this.
[01:18:17.790 --> 01:18:20.872]  And so, yes, we're going into that, but it's going to be incremental.
[01:18:21.866 --> 01:18:26.427]  The feds now say, by the end of this decade, it's going to be 30 million in prison.
[01:18:28.387 --> 01:18:29.187]  They're saying that.
[01:18:31.188 --> 01:18:34.548]  So how are we going to go from 1 million to 7 million to 30 million?
[01:18:35.548 --> 01:18:36.809]  We're at 7 mil right now.
[01:18:37.449 --> 01:18:38.289]  That's the camp.
[01:18:40.209 --> 01:18:43.310]  And it's happening incrementally, just like in Nazi Germany.
[01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:46.470]  They just come arrest you for questioning, you're never seen again.
[01:18:47.591 --> 01:18:49.931]  Homeland Security is now visiting toy store owners.
[01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:51.920]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:53.682 --> 01:18:59.885]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:19:00.346 --> 01:19:08.111]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:19:08.451 --> 01:19:16.316]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:19:16.596 --> 01:19:18.537]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[01:20:01.808 --> 01:20:05.852]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria.

[01:20:52.907 --> 01:20:55.928]  You and your family members getting enough minerals in the daily diet?
[01:20:56.308 --> 01:20:58.808]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[01:20:59.048 --> 01:21:06.110]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:09.591]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[01:21:09.831 --> 01:21:11.871]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[01:21:12.211 --> 01:21:20.033]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[01:21:20.293 --> 01:21:20.893]  We're good to go.

[01:21:56.056 --> 01:21:59.698]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[01:22:00.339 --> 01:22:04.221]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[01:22:04.921 --> 01:22:13.466]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[01:22:14.449 --> 01:22:21.653]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain, and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.

[01:22:53.410 --> 01:22:58.373]  All right, I said I'd go to calls fast.
[01:22:58.433 --> 01:22:59.294]  I'm not doing that.
[01:22:59.314 --> 01:23:01.215]  I'm going on forever about each issue.
[01:23:01.255 --> 01:23:03.476]  Let's just give each caller about 60 seconds.
[01:23:03.977 --> 01:23:05.538]  Chad in California, go ahead.
[01:23:05.558 --> 01:23:06.178]  You're on the air.
[01:23:06.198 --> 01:23:07.379]  Hello, Alex Jones.
[01:23:07.699 --> 01:23:07.939]  Yes.
[01:23:08.179 --> 01:23:09.820]  It is a pleasure to speak to you, my friend.
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:10.561]  Nice to talk to you.
[01:23:10.601 --> 01:23:10.901]  Go ahead.
[01:23:11.808 --> 01:23:21.736]  I just wanted to bring up, in the debate, you heard Carrie speak about, with Homeland Security, all the containers that are coming in, and they're not being scanned.
[01:23:22.157 --> 01:23:24.879]  You know, the containers coming in from international waters.
[01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:33.946]  And I have a friend of mine who had some furniture brought in from Valley, had it shipped in, and her container got picked to get scanned.
[01:23:34.407 --> 01:23:38.270]  And they x-rayed it, and after x-raying it, they said, oh, they had to go in there and search it.
[01:23:38.290 --> 01:23:39.871]  And I just had wood in there
[01:23:40.444 --> 01:23:45.286]  They charged her for x-raying it and for going in and searching it.
[01:23:45.306 --> 01:23:47.827]  She got hit with over a $3,000 bill.
[01:23:48.547 --> 01:23:54.949]  And when I hear them talk about, oh, we need to search every container coming in, does that mean that we're going to extort?
[01:23:55.229 --> 01:23:57.070]  Yeah, that's exactly.
[01:23:57.310 --> 01:24:02.032]  Look, this new maritime administration will be over every facet.
[01:24:02.072 --> 01:24:04.733]  There's maritime and there's also infrastructure protection.
[01:24:05.293 --> 01:24:07.954]  And I have the Associated Press right here today.
[01:24:09.326 --> 01:24:14.450]  And it's Homeland Security agents visit toy store, and they admit the patent is out on Rubik's Cube.
[01:24:14.771 --> 01:24:16.372]  She didn't even make the new Rubik's Cubes.
[01:24:16.412 --> 01:24:17.233]  Another company did.
[01:24:17.513 --> 01:24:19.775]  They didn't visit the company that made the new Rubik's Cube.
[01:24:20.075 --> 01:24:20.996]  They visited her.
[01:24:21.076 --> 01:24:25.379]  They gave her a call, and then two agents came and said, no judge's order, no nothing.
[01:24:25.419 --> 01:24:28.762]  They said, look, we have the power to order you to take those off your shelf.
[01:24:29.763 --> 01:24:31.624]  And they made her take the Rubik's Cubes.
[01:24:31.664 --> 01:24:33.706]  And she said, wait a minute, aren't there terrorists out there?
[01:24:34.026 --> 01:24:38.250]  So they're dealing with Rubik's Cubes, folks, not with our security and safety.
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:38.880]  No.
[01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:45.424]  No, it's organized crime at the highest level, and it really upsets me.
[01:24:46.064 --> 01:24:48.186]  So she had a container with some furniture, and it was three grand.
[01:24:48.206 --> 01:24:50.847]  She had a container with just furniture, and she got hit with about a $3,200 bill.
[01:24:50.887 --> 01:24:55.090]  Yeah, this is all, I assumed they were going to charge people to do it.
[01:24:56.134 --> 01:24:57.635]  It's all part of the new fund, but don't worry.
[01:24:57.655 --> 01:25:11.323]  If you're a big Chinese company or one of the big global companies, you'll never get searched, and then they can selectively search companies who aren't on the global payroll, who aren't on the inside good old boy track, and that'll be like an extra little invisible tariff.
[01:25:12.523 --> 01:25:13.104]  You understand?
[01:25:13.144 --> 01:25:15.225]  And that'll even more consolidate things.
[01:25:15.265 --> 01:25:15.805]  Thanks for the call.
[01:25:16.386 --> 01:25:17.186]  Great points, Chad.
[01:25:17.206 --> 01:25:18.647]  Have your friend send me some info on that.
[01:25:18.667 --> 01:25:19.748]  I'd like to have her on as a guest.
[01:25:20.088 --> 01:25:21.088]  That's very newsworthy.
[01:25:21.589 --> 01:25:23.109]  John and Mass, you're on the air.
[01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.730]  Go ahead, John.
[01:25:24.597 --> 01:25:25.057]  Hi, Alex.
[01:25:25.077 --> 01:25:25.578]  How you doing?
[01:25:25.638 --> 01:25:25.898]  Good.
[01:25:26.579 --> 01:25:26.779]  Good.
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:29.821]  I called earlier this week about the Red Sox.
[01:25:30.382 --> 01:25:34.225]  I actually taped the live scenes after the game.
[01:25:34.806 --> 01:25:41.191]  And on it, I caught them setting off the smoke bombs as well as peppering the crowd.
[01:25:41.211 --> 01:25:46.095]  I don't know if you want the tape or not, but I can definitely... You're saying that they shot at the crowd again?
[01:25:47.096 --> 01:25:48.037]  Not with the same ones.
[01:25:48.057 --> 01:25:50.739]  They were trying to get live cameras banned.
[01:25:51.685 --> 01:25:52.626]  Yeah, I know.
[01:25:52.686 --> 01:25:57.408]  I saw the mayor say that she wanted to ban live television coverage because that makes it worse.
[01:25:57.689 --> 01:25:59.790]  So now, oh, you can't have cameras.
[01:25:59.850 --> 01:26:01.531]  So what, the cops were going after cameras?
[01:26:02.531 --> 01:26:07.034]  They weren't going after the cameras because they had most of the cameras on helicopter.
[01:26:07.454 --> 01:26:08.755]  There were no ground cameras, though.
[01:26:09.535 --> 01:26:12.957]  So they got a view from the sky of what was going on.
[01:26:13.577 --> 01:26:17.560]  And you could see them firing the smoke bombs.
[01:26:18.721 --> 01:26:20.702]  I don't know, canisters right at the protest.
[01:26:21.023 --> 01:26:25.126]  Yeah, not at the protesters, at the celebrators.
[01:26:26.106 --> 01:26:28.528]  Well, they just suspended people for that.
[01:26:29.589 --> 01:26:36.473]  Some of the cops, the leaders, saying that they just randomly, this is the Boston Herald today, shot at crowds.
[01:26:37.294 --> 01:26:38.175]  They certainly did.
[01:26:38.435 --> 01:26:39.215]  I got it on tape.
[01:26:39.816 --> 01:26:43.818]  And you could also see the way they systematically...
[01:26:45.254 --> 01:26:47.237]  And what were they saying that the crowd had done?
[01:26:47.257 --> 01:26:47.818]  Nothing.
[01:26:47.838 --> 01:26:49.460]  They wanted to clear them out.
[01:27:04.753 --> 01:27:07.235]  So it's just part of, you know, you're out on the street, we shoot at you.
[01:27:07.435 --> 01:27:08.656]  Yeah, I read the news article.
[01:27:08.716 --> 01:27:10.177]  Of course, we didn't see the video on the news.
[01:27:10.458 --> 01:27:11.318]  Do me a big favor.
[01:27:11.398 --> 01:27:16.182]  Mail me that video in SP speed, and tell us what free video you want.
[01:27:16.202 --> 01:27:16.943]  We'll ship you a video.
[01:27:19.385 --> 01:27:20.286]  Okay, that'd be great.
[01:27:21.787 --> 01:27:22.788]  The address is on your site.
[01:27:22.828 --> 01:27:23.588]  I can get it off of there?
[01:27:23.828 --> 01:27:27.792]  Yeah, it's right to Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R.
[01:27:35.254 --> 01:27:38.657]  Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:27:42.139 --> 01:27:42.459]  Excellent.
[01:27:42.519 --> 01:27:43.860]  I'll definitely get that out to you.
[01:27:44.761 --> 01:27:47.743]  Yeah, and just mark it as police in Boston.
[01:27:48.543 --> 01:27:50.625]  So what was it like watching the video of this?
[01:27:52.046 --> 01:27:59.311]  Well, at first it was kind of nice because, you know, the Sox won, so everyone was just out celebrating and having a good time.
[01:27:59.451 --> 01:28:01.593]  And then all of a sudden you could just see them...
[01:28:02.972 --> 01:28:05.113]  They just pen people in and push them.
[01:28:05.373 --> 01:28:10.796]  So they're like, hey, we killed somebody last week and we had so much fun, we're going to come back out and attack you again.
[01:28:11.636 --> 01:28:12.116]  Pretty much.
[01:28:13.217 --> 01:28:14.597]  Well, this is like a football game.
[01:28:14.617 --> 01:28:16.778]  They're training the cops to beat and attack the public.
[01:28:16.818 --> 01:28:19.179]  They get all the beat cops in the black uniforms.
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:20.380]  It's just all part of your service.
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:22.521]  You know, getting the boys to get a taste of blood.
[01:28:23.682 --> 01:28:24.182]  Absolutely.
[01:28:24.942 --> 01:28:26.623]  So they would just randomly arrest people, huh?
[01:28:27.778 --> 01:28:28.299]  You can see it.
[01:28:28.459 --> 01:28:29.139]  I got it on tape.
[01:28:29.159 --> 01:28:33.283]  They would just shoot, run right out, grab someone, surround them, and then that was it.
[01:28:33.483 --> 01:28:34.123]  They'd take them away.
[01:28:35.484 --> 01:28:35.824]  All right.
[01:28:35.885 --> 01:28:36.665]  Thank you for the call, sir.
[01:28:36.685 --> 01:28:37.866]  I'm looking forward to that video, John.
[01:28:38.747 --> 01:28:39.307]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.971 --> 01:28:44.911]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.372 --> 01:28:46.993]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.894 --> 01:28:50.596]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.611 --> 01:28:56.092]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:28:56.313 --> 01:29:03.639]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:29:03.959 --> 01:29:08.363]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:29:08.643 --> 01:29:18.472]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:29:19.233 --> 01:29:22.897]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[01:29:23.237 --> 01:29:25.700]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:31.947]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:29:32.187 --> 01:29:33.729]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:29:34.009 --> 01:29:34.889]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:29:34.970 --> 01:29:37.971]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[01:29:38.131 --> 01:29:39.031]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[01:29:39.071 --> 01:29:39.251]  That's 800-255-1912.
[01:29:39.311 --> 01:29:42.333]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's food supply updates.
[01:29:42.353 --> 01:29:43.033]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:29:53.953 --> 01:29:58.554]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[01:29:58.774 --> 01:30:03.216]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[01:30:03.396 --> 01:30:17.420]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey light water purifier, an LED base, two Berkey sport filtration bottles, the Berkey battery adapter, the Berkey MP solar charger, as well as a backup set of two black Berkey purification elements.
[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:36.856]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones, as well as power for small applications.
[01:30:37.076 --> 01:30:40.679]  Get the one-stop solution for your emergency and everyday needs.
[01:30:40.839 --> 01:30:43.521]  The Berkey Security Pack, a retail value of $518 for only $399.
[01:30:46.323 --> 01:30:47.224]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:31:08.376 --> 01:31:12.240]  The FDA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:12.821]  Fragrance?
[01:31:13.201 --> 01:31:17.946]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:31:18.086 --> 01:31:22.771]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[01:31:23.011 --> 01:31:25.434]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[01:31:25.814 --> 01:31:29.216]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:31:29.356 --> 01:31:32.937]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[01:31:33.118 --> 01:31:35.479]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[01:31:35.639 --> 01:31:36.519]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:31:36.639 --> 01:31:46.364]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.

[01:31:58.527 --> 01:32:00.448]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:00.928 --> 01:32:03.750]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:05.170 --> 01:32:12.014]  Yeah, I'm glad that John and Matt just called in about this because I do have the news articles about what happened when they won the World Series a couple nights ago.
[01:32:13.074 --> 01:32:17.837]  People were out and, you know, a few causing problems, but then they would again just randomly shoot into crowds.
[01:32:19.286 --> 01:32:22.267]  And that's what killed the girl, Snellen Grove, last week.
[01:32:22.547 --> 01:32:25.308]  Here's the Boston Herald from two days ago about what happened last week.
[01:32:25.808 --> 01:32:27.329]  Boston peppered crowd.
[01:32:27.429 --> 01:32:29.629]  Witnesses, superintendent, randomly fired pellets.
[01:32:30.490 --> 01:32:33.511]  And he was the commander, and he just got off on it and said, give me one of those.
[01:32:33.591 --> 01:32:35.551]  And they just started going up and shooting people real close.
[01:32:36.051 --> 01:32:45.935]  A police superintendent and at least two special operations officers randomly sprayed pepper pellets into a raucous crowd outside Fenway Park at the moment before an Emerson College student was struck in the eye and killed.
[01:32:45.955 --> 01:32:47.155]  The witness told the Herald.
[01:32:47.695 --> 01:32:59.659]  I saw Deputy Superintendent Robert O'Toole and the other special operations officers flailing their guns from side to side like machine guns, said Genevieve Del Francini, 30, an Emerson College graduate student.
[01:32:59.999 --> 01:33:02.000]  They were just popping off shots at the crowd.
[01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:12.923]  DeFrancini, who said he was standing over to O'Toole when he asked another officer for a pepper pellet gun, did not know O'Toole's name until he saw him in a photograph in the Herald.
[01:33:13.729 --> 01:33:27.159]  He and another source identified O'Toole as the commander of the Boston Special Operations Unit as one of the officers who fired high-powered pepper pellet guns, rubber bullets, folks, to quell a riot after a Sox game won the American League pennant last week.
[01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:32.243]  And all they've done is placed him on paid administrative support position.
[01:33:32.283 --> 01:33:35.346]  The other two have been put into an injured leave.
[01:33:36.767 --> 01:33:42.411]  And then their lawyer says, well, they've gotten a lawyer, but that should not be taken as a suggestion that Bob O'Toole has done anything wrong.
[01:33:44.208 --> 01:33:57.791]  Attorney Jeffrey Dinner, who represents Boston University, and student Kaplan Balhamti, questioned yesterday why Atul, the supervisor of riot control efforts at Fenway, would be firing a weapon with his officers.
[01:33:57.831 --> 01:34:00.112]  Well, you've got to show off how tough you are.
[01:34:00.812 --> 01:34:05.153]  If you're out there shooting, you cannot be supervising and making good decisions, Dinner said.
[01:34:07.159 --> 01:34:23.984]  And his client, a 19-year-old honor student who was hit in the head with a pepper bullet, said he has been in constant pain since doctors removed part of the pellet from inside his sinus cavity where it penetrated into his skull and became lodged by his brain.
[01:34:24.284 --> 01:34:28.305]  I mean, inches away from killing more people.
[01:34:28.625 --> 01:34:29.826]  And does that stop him?
[01:34:29.946 --> 01:34:30.526]  Oh, no.
[01:34:30.846 --> 01:34:31.866]  We're going to do it again.
[01:34:31.886 --> 01:34:34.547]  We're going to go out and shoot more people.
[01:34:35.754 --> 01:34:37.335]  You're going to learn to like it!
[01:34:37.355 --> 01:34:44.318]  A couple other articles, and we'll go to John and Johnny and Wes and others that are patiently holding.
[01:34:45.198 --> 01:34:50.320]  This is from RFID Journal, one of the propaganda publications of the chip sellers.
[01:34:51.101 --> 01:34:52.381]  A growing number of U.S.
[01:34:52.441 --> 01:35:01.205]  mass transit operators are giving a green light to contactless fare collection, say transit agency officials and integrators.
[01:35:02.086 --> 01:35:06.009]  Smart Card Alliance 04 annual fall conference in San Francisco held last week.
[01:35:06.049 --> 01:35:12.914]  A number of sensors indicated strong growth, continuing interest in applications for contactless payment services.
[01:35:13.134 --> 01:35:13.735]  Here's the problem.
[01:35:13.815 --> 01:35:17.998]  They're going to make you show a driver's license to get one of these, and they know exactly what you do.
[01:35:19.119 --> 01:35:24.383]  And then, of course, I already mentioned your toy store gets a visit by Homeland Security saying, well, that's a...
[01:35:27.599 --> 01:35:29.460]  That's a patented Rubik's Cube you're selling.
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:30.941]  Well, you admit the patent's up.
[01:35:31.001 --> 01:35:32.121]  Well, we just got a complaint.
[01:35:32.141 --> 01:35:33.142]  You better take them off your shelves.
[01:35:33.562 --> 01:35:35.363]  We're not going after the manufacturer, though.
[01:35:35.723 --> 01:35:39.124]  Homeland Security is here at your small toy store.
[01:35:39.484 --> 01:35:42.646]  Small, little toy store.
[01:35:42.766 --> 01:35:44.306]  And this is what Homeland's all about.
[01:35:44.346 --> 01:35:47.628]  And they say in the article that we're here to deal with the entire economy.
[01:35:48.588 --> 01:35:49.028]  Everything.
[01:35:49.729 --> 01:35:51.129]  See, everything is Homeland Security.
[01:35:51.409 --> 01:35:52.630]  But I thought it was for terrorists.
[01:35:54.033 --> 01:35:54.593]  Hey, let her know.
[01:35:54.633 --> 01:35:56.734]  Lady, we can arrest you and charge you as a terrorist.
[01:35:56.934 --> 01:36:01.076]  So you better stop selling the keys.
[01:36:01.156 --> 01:36:03.017]  One last article, then we'll go back to your calls.
[01:36:03.197 --> 01:36:04.378]  Do this at home.
[01:36:04.538 --> 01:36:05.638]  Test your microwave.
[01:36:05.698 --> 01:36:07.119]  This is out of the Idaho Observer.
[01:36:07.139 --> 01:36:09.780]  And I've read major medical studies on this.
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:12.321]  Irradiated food is even worse.
[01:36:12.401 --> 01:36:15.243]  And they're already doing it with most of the school lunch program beef, chicken, and pork.
[01:36:16.103 --> 01:36:18.064]  And it just destroys all the value of the food.
[01:36:18.124 --> 01:36:22.906]  Breaks up the ring structures between the vitamins and minerals where your body can't absorb them.
[01:36:24.289 --> 01:36:27.290]  Well, microwaves aren't as bad, but they're nearly as bad.
[01:36:27.330 --> 01:36:32.452]  And they've got hundreds of studies now that cell phones give you brain tumors, but hey, you know, so what?
[01:36:32.992 --> 01:36:33.773]  Do this at home.
[01:36:33.873 --> 01:36:34.993]  Test your microwave.
[01:36:35.013 --> 01:36:40.735]  If you've ever wondered whether or not microwave food is safe, here's an experiment you can do at home.
[01:36:41.416 --> 01:36:42.656]  Plant seeds in two pots.
[01:36:42.736 --> 01:36:46.638]  Water one pot with water that has been microwaved, the other with regular tap water.
[01:36:47.198 --> 01:36:52.860]  The seeds that receive microwave water won't sprout because it breaks up the mineral and...
[01:36:56.289 --> 01:36:57.890]  Other nutrient chains that are in the water.
[01:36:59.231 --> 01:37:01.433]  The seeds that receive microwave water won't sprout.
[01:37:01.493 --> 01:37:07.717]  If microwave water can't sprout plants from growing, think of what microwave food can do to your health.
[01:37:08.718 --> 01:37:14.102]  In 1989, Swiss biologist and food specialist Dr. Hans Hertel studied the effects of microwave food.
[01:37:14.142 --> 01:37:15.683]  Eight people participated in the study.
[01:37:15.963 --> 01:37:22.548]  For eight weeks, they lived in a controlled environment and intermittently ate raw foods, conventionally cooked foods, and microwave foods.
[01:37:24.033 --> 01:37:26.054]  Blood samples were tested for each meal.
[01:37:27.234 --> 01:37:31.535]  They discovered that eating microwave food over time causes significant changes in blood chemistry.
[01:37:32.476 --> 01:37:41.299]  A decrease in hemoglobin and cholesterol values in HDL, good cholesterol, versus LDL, bad cholesterol ratio in white blood cells, increasing.
[01:37:41.959 --> 01:37:44.420]  Weakening the immune system and an increase in...
[01:37:46.212 --> 01:37:55.474]  Leukokite cells, which tend to indicate poisoning and cell damage conditions, ripening the body for degenerative diseases and or cancer.
[01:37:57.334 --> 01:38:10.617]  And it says, part two, the miserable effects of man through the ingestion of microwave food, unlike untreated food and blood allergens, that can also be found in the beginning of a pathological disease.
[01:38:11.312 --> 01:38:19.339]  A condition also indicate of a beginning cancerous process, wrote Dr. Bernard Block, who assisted in the study.
[01:38:19.619 --> 01:38:29.728]  Number three, microwave ovens cook food by forcing the atoms, molecules, and cells within the food to reverse polarity billions of times per second, causing friction.
[01:38:30.109 --> 01:38:35.754]  The more the friction, the more the heat, the oscillation, tears and deforms the molecular structure of the food.
[01:38:36.114 --> 01:38:37.415]  New compounds called molecules.
[01:38:38.527 --> 01:38:42.251]  Radiolic compounds which are not to be found in nature are formed.
[01:38:43.371 --> 01:38:47.475]  So again, you rub the molecules together and it breaks off new toxic chains.
[01:38:48.536 --> 01:38:56.282]  Interestingly, microwaves are actually used in gene-altering technology to deliberately break cells and neutralize their life force so they can be manipulated.
[01:38:56.342 --> 01:38:56.942]  That's a quote.
[01:38:57.443 --> 01:39:01.266]  Microwaves destroy the life force that gives food its vitality and nourishment.
[01:39:01.726 --> 01:39:07.471]  When the life force dissipates, microorganisms start breaking food down and it begins to rot
[01:39:08.169 --> 01:39:13.353]  Early 91, a lawsuit was filed against an Oklahoma hospital because a patient died from receiving a microwave blood transfusion.
[01:39:13.954 --> 01:39:17.116]  Hospitals routinely heat blood for transfusion, but not in a microwave.
[01:39:17.837 --> 01:39:30.347]  The effects of microwaving breast milk have also been researched by Dr. Kerner, M.D., and Richard Quinn, M.D., from Stanford University, and microwaving human milk, even at a low setting, can destroy some of its important disease-fighting capabilities.
[01:39:31.588 --> 01:39:33.129]  I'll read the rest of this in the next hour.
[01:39:33.169 --> 01:39:34.931]  It goes on and on and on.
[01:39:37.060 --> 01:39:38.581]  Folks, I know all about cell phones.
[01:39:38.621 --> 01:39:45.543]  I've probably read a hundred studies myself, and I still have one of the things, and I still use it, and I get lazy and lose the little wire that goes in my ear.
[01:39:45.563 --> 01:39:54.667]  The only thing you can do, and then I end up using it, and I've now bought a wireless transmitter that plugs in, and I've read the studies, those are not dangerous.
[01:39:55.507 --> 01:39:57.908]  You get a wireless earpiece, and it costs you 50 bucks.
[01:39:59.002 --> 01:40:01.004]  Instead of 15 or 20 for the wire.
[01:40:01.344 --> 01:40:03.386]  And you need to make yourself not have it.
[01:40:03.446 --> 01:40:04.727]  And do not put the phone.
[01:40:05.207 --> 01:40:13.254]  I caught myself, just like cops do, with the earpiece in my ear and driving down the road with the phone between my legs so it doesn't roll off the console.
[01:40:14.035 --> 01:40:16.277]  And they admit that will give you testicular cancer.
[01:40:17.098 --> 01:40:20.260]  Just like the cops with the radar guns get it by laying it between their legs.
[01:40:20.761 --> 01:40:21.682]  Just stop it!
[01:40:22.342 --> 01:40:23.603]  Stop taking the vaccine!
[01:40:23.683 --> 01:40:24.644]  Stop using these!
[01:40:25.805 --> 01:40:26.766]  The cell phones don't
[01:40:27.423 --> 01:40:31.626]  You've got to have them at least two feet away from you, folks, to really not have bad effects.
[01:40:31.646 --> 01:40:32.646]  Right up against your head.
[01:40:32.666 --> 01:40:36.068]  Oh, man, I mean, how do they do all this to us?
[01:40:36.569 --> 01:40:39.571]  And they just build it into the society where it's hard to avoid it.
[01:40:40.411 --> 01:40:44.814]  Folks, I work so hard, a lot of times I'll throw something in the microwave.
[01:40:47.215 --> 01:40:50.037]  I mean, I've even, you know, every once in a while I'm in a hurry.
[01:40:52.059 --> 01:40:54.680]  You know, my son's eating microwave food.
[01:40:55.180 --> 01:40:55.861]  It's wrong.
[01:40:56.593 --> 01:40:58.115]  We've got to stop it.
[01:40:58.495 --> 01:41:01.918]  We've got to consciously take control of our lives.
[01:41:02.399 --> 01:41:04.320]  Let's talk to John in Texas.
[01:41:04.340 --> 01:41:05.021]  John, go ahead.
[01:41:06.603 --> 01:41:10.546]  Alex, I was wondering, you know who that Perry Logan character is on ACTV, right?
[01:41:11.147 --> 01:41:12.068]  Yeah, I really don't care.
[01:41:12.088 --> 01:41:16.772]  Yeah, well, lately he's been spending most of his shows basically attacking you.
[01:41:16.852 --> 01:41:17.293]  Good.
[01:41:17.313 --> 01:41:18.193]  Sir, sir.
[01:41:19.785 --> 01:41:21.066]  I've had the New York Times.
[01:41:21.366 --> 01:41:22.467]  I've had Vanity Fair.
[01:41:22.807 --> 01:41:25.150]  I've had the American Legion.
[01:41:25.590 --> 01:41:28.513]  I mean, I've had national talk show hosts spend time attacking me.
[01:41:28.773 --> 01:41:32.376]  I could care less about local people attacking me.
[01:41:32.416 --> 01:41:33.978]  That is an indicator of my success.
[01:41:34.833 --> 01:41:45.041]  Well, Alex, what I was wondering is maybe he's trying to get you to respond on TV so that the ACTV board can use that as a pretext to remove you from TV for practicing hate speech.
[01:41:45.582 --> 01:41:46.763]  And that would be paying you back.
[01:41:46.803 --> 01:41:47.503]  You know what?
[01:41:47.824 --> 01:41:48.284]  I don't know.
[01:41:48.324 --> 01:41:48.824]  I don't care.
[01:41:48.884 --> 01:41:49.545]  I don't watch it.
[01:41:49.605 --> 01:41:53.388]  The guy emails me on a weekly basis going, there is no New World Order.
[01:41:53.448 --> 01:41:56.691]  You know, just ridiculous stuff.
[01:41:56.731 --> 01:41:58.072]  And no one pays attention to that.
[01:41:58.132 --> 01:41:59.233]  I mean, it doesn't even matter.
[01:42:00.474 --> 01:42:04.217]  You know what they say to the World War II pilots at night who couldn't navigate?
[01:42:05.242 --> 01:42:06.862]  And we're having trouble getting over their targets?
[01:42:07.262 --> 01:42:10.123]  They said, fly into the heart of the flak and drop your bombs.
[01:42:10.803 --> 01:42:11.443]  That's what I do.
[01:42:11.783 --> 01:42:16.304]  So when I'm getting massive flak, I'm over Berlin, baby.
[01:42:16.684 --> 01:42:17.704]  I'm over Tokyo.
[01:42:18.284 --> 01:42:19.765]  Win the flaks all around me.
[01:42:20.425 --> 01:42:22.345]  And when I drop my info bombs.
[01:42:22.365 --> 01:42:32.527]  And so every day I fly in on repeated Saudis, and I bomb and pound the enemy, and just don't even worry about being targeted.
[01:42:32.547 --> 01:42:33.347]  Thanks for the call.
[01:42:34.278 --> 01:42:35.118]  I appreciate it, sir.
[01:42:35.158 --> 01:42:37.019]  But, I mean, the show is not about Alex Jones.
[01:42:37.819 --> 01:42:38.639]  It really isn't.
[01:42:39.439 --> 01:42:41.559]  And, I mean, I could just care less.
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:43.240]  But I appreciate your concern, John.
[01:42:43.540 --> 01:42:45.860]  We're going to go to Johnny in Hawaii and Wes here in a few minutes.
[01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:51.701]  But here is this piece from the Daily Show host on Crossfire.
[01:42:51.741 --> 01:42:53.642]  We've edited the one mild expletive out of it.
[01:42:53.902 --> 01:42:56.362]  But it isn't newsworthy that you be aware of this.
[01:42:58.143 --> 01:42:58.663]  John's correct.
[01:42:58.683 --> 01:42:59.223]  He's right on it.
[01:42:59.758 --> 01:43:00.959]  We're going to go to that in a second.
[01:43:00.979 --> 01:43:05.881]  John Stewart acts like he's this big savior, but if you're really watching, it's still pro-New World Order.
[01:43:06.121 --> 01:43:08.162]  But he is better than a lot of the so-called news channels.
[01:43:08.542 --> 01:43:14.465]  And he really stood up to both of the ultra-big government pimps, Carlson and Begala.
[01:43:14.525 --> 01:43:20.068]  Begala, stroke of the pen, kind of cool, all the land, all martial law, great thing about executive orders.
[01:43:23.738 --> 01:43:27.821]  I do like watching him tear into them, and I do enjoy the show, and he does make better points than most.
[01:43:28.301 --> 01:43:31.963]  But, I mean, so does Politically Incorrect on HBO, one of the few things I'll watch.
[01:43:32.243 --> 01:43:35.905]  He was on there this week saying, the flu vaccine will kill you, it's deadly, don't trust it.
[01:43:36.226 --> 01:43:39.087]  But then by the end of the show, well, I guess the war is okay.
[01:43:41.129 --> 01:43:46.672]  Again, they're having to act like they're us more and more to try to get us to join their agenda.
[01:43:46.692 --> 01:43:49.694]  But it's a left-wing agenda that's also controlled by the New World Order.
[01:43:49.974 --> 01:43:50.814]  So here's the clip.
[01:43:50.854 --> 01:43:53.256]  Here's Jon Stewart on Crossfire.
[01:43:53.966 --> 01:44:07.549]  It's funny, you know, and I made a special effort to come on the show today because I have privately, amongst my friends, and also in occasional newspapers and television shows, mentioned this show as being bad.
[01:44:10.569 --> 01:44:18.591]  And I wanted to, I felt that that wasn't fair and I should come here and tell you that I don't, it's not so much that it's bad as it's hurting America.
[01:44:19.941 --> 01:44:26.447]  So I wanted to come here today and say... Here's just what I wanted to tell you guys.
[01:44:27.087 --> 01:44:27.528]  Stop.
[01:44:29.589 --> 01:44:30.850]  Stop, stop, stop.
[01:44:31.211 --> 01:44:33.012]  Stop hurting America.
[01:44:33.213 --> 01:44:34.434]  And come work for us.
[01:44:34.494 --> 01:44:36.675]  Because we, as the people... How do you pay?
[01:44:37.036 --> 01:44:38.137]  The people, not well.
[01:44:39.378 --> 01:44:40.679]  But you can sleep at night.
[01:44:41.562 --> 01:44:45.124]  See, the thing is, we need your help.
[01:44:45.224 --> 01:44:50.648]  Right now, you're helping the politicians and the corporations, and we're left out there to mow our lawns.
[01:44:50.688 --> 01:44:52.489]  You just said we're too rough on them when they make mistakes.
[01:44:52.509 --> 01:44:53.770]  No, no, no, you're not too rough on them.
[01:44:53.790 --> 01:44:55.891]  You are part of their strategies.
[01:44:56.392 --> 01:44:57.392]  You're partisan.
[01:44:57.873 --> 01:44:58.893]  What do you call it?
[01:44:59.354 --> 01:44:59.714]  Hacks.
[01:45:00.334 --> 01:45:04.617]  Wait, John, let me tell you something valuable that I think we do that I'd like to see you do.
[01:45:04.637 --> 01:45:05.397]  Something valuable?
[01:45:05.477 --> 01:45:08.539]  Yeah, no, it's... I would like to hear it.
[01:45:08.659 --> 01:45:13.702]  And I'll tell you, when politicians come on, it's nice to get them to try and answer the question.
[01:45:14.103 --> 01:45:16.284]  In order to do that, we try to ask them pointed questions.
[01:45:16.324 --> 01:45:19.726]  I want to contrast our questions with some questions you asked John Kerry.
[01:45:20.266 --> 01:45:23.248]  If you want to compare your show to a comedy show, you're more than welcome to.
[01:45:23.368 --> 01:45:24.109]  No, no, here's the point.
[01:45:24.629 --> 01:45:28.030]  If that's your goal, I wouldn't aim for us.
[01:45:28.090 --> 01:45:29.130]  Here's the problem.
[01:45:29.150 --> 01:45:30.170]  That's a very good show.
[01:45:30.210 --> 01:45:31.390]  Kerry won't come on this show.
[01:45:31.650 --> 01:45:32.530]  He will come on your show.
[01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:34.691]  Let me suggest why he wants to come on this show.
[01:45:34.711 --> 01:45:35.631]  Well, we have civilized discourse.
[01:45:35.651 --> 01:45:36.851]  Here's an example of civilized discourse.
[01:45:36.871 --> 01:45:38.112]  Here are three of the questions you asked, John.
[01:45:38.412 --> 01:45:40.192]  You have a chance to interview the Democratic nominee.
[01:45:40.212 --> 01:45:42.392]  You ask him questions such as, quote, How are you holding up?
[01:45:43.452 --> 01:45:45.213]  Is it hard not to take the attacks personally?
[01:45:45.433 --> 01:45:46.453]  Have you ever flip-flopped?
[01:45:46.553 --> 01:45:47.253]  Et cetera, et cetera.
[01:45:47.853 --> 01:45:49.654]  Didn't you feel like you got the chance to interview the guy?
[01:45:49.674 --> 01:45:51.714]  Why don't you ask him a real question instead of just suck up to him?
[01:45:52.449 --> 01:45:54.970]  Yeah, how you're holding up is a real suck-up.
[01:45:55.111 --> 01:46:01.374]  And I actually was giving him a hot stone massage.
[01:46:01.414 --> 01:46:14.862]  You know, it's interesting to hear you talk about my responsibility to the, you know, I didn't realize that, and maybe this explains quite a bit, is that the news organizations look to Comedy Central for their cues on integrity.
[01:46:17.063 --> 01:46:23.565]  What I would suggest is, when you talk about you're holding politicians' feet to the fire, I think that's disingenuous.
[01:46:23.626 --> 01:46:24.926]  How are you holding up?
[01:46:25.286 --> 01:46:25.827]  I mean, come on.
[01:46:26.127 --> 01:46:26.707]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:46:26.827 --> 01:46:31.889]  I don't... But my role isn't... You can ask them a real question, don't you think?
[01:46:32.489 --> 01:46:37.532]  Instead of saying, you know... I don't think I... By the way, I also asked him, you know, were you in Cambodia?
[01:46:38.012 --> 01:46:38.972]  But I didn't really care.
[01:46:38.992 --> 01:46:39.993]  Because...
[01:46:41.435 --> 01:46:44.697]  I don't care because I think it's stupid.
[01:46:44.777 --> 01:46:45.877]  But my point is this.
[01:46:46.978 --> 01:46:56.002]  If your idea of confronting me is that I don't ask hard-hitting enough news questions, we're in bad shape, fellas.
[01:46:56.022 --> 01:46:57.442]  We're here to love you, not confront you.
[01:46:57.542 --> 01:46:59.543]  No, no, no, but what I'm saying is this.
[01:47:00.424 --> 01:47:00.944]  I'm not.
[01:47:01.804 --> 01:47:07.807]  I'm here to confront you because we need help from the media and they're hurting
[01:47:08.243 --> 01:47:09.024]  Hurting us.
[01:47:09.806 --> 01:47:12.210]  And the idea is... It's the indictment.
[01:47:12.270 --> 01:47:13.152]  Let me get this straight.
[01:47:13.232 --> 01:47:13.933]  It's the indictment.
[01:47:15.580 --> 01:47:20.881]  If your guideline is, and I have seen you say this, that Crossfire reduces everything, as I said in the intro, to left, right, left, right.
[01:47:20.921 --> 01:47:21.141]  Yes.
[01:47:21.281 --> 01:47:23.622]  Well, it's because, see, we're a debate show.
[01:47:23.702 --> 01:47:25.522]  No, no, no, that would be great.
[01:47:25.662 --> 01:47:27.422]  I would love to see a debate show.
[01:47:27.462 --> 01:47:29.703]  In a 24-hour day where we have each side on.
[01:47:29.963 --> 01:47:31.183]  No, no, no, that would be great.
[01:47:31.203 --> 01:47:32.023]  And have them fight it out.
[01:47:32.083 --> 01:47:33.524]  To do a debate would be great.
[01:47:33.964 --> 01:47:39.845]  But that's like saying pro-wrestling is a show about athletic competition.
[01:47:39.965 --> 01:47:41.105]  I think you're a good comedian.
[01:47:41.145 --> 01:47:42.586]  I think your lectures are boring.
[01:47:42.606 --> 01:47:44.606]  Let me ask you a question on the news.
[01:47:45.206 --> 01:47:46.067]  Now, this is theater.
[01:47:46.187 --> 01:47:47.428]  I mean, it's obvious.
[01:47:47.748 --> 01:47:48.329]  How old are you?
[01:47:48.889 --> 01:47:48.329]  35.
[01:47:49.149 --> 01:47:50.230]  And you wear a bow tie.
[01:47:50.290 --> 01:47:51.551]  Yeah, I do.
[01:47:51.851 --> 01:47:53.693]  So this is... I know, I know.
[01:47:53.713 --> 01:47:54.593]  This is theater.
[01:47:54.613 --> 01:47:55.254]  Let me just go.
[01:47:55.334 --> 01:47:55.874]  Now, come on.
[01:47:55.954 --> 01:48:00.838]  And listen, I'm not suggesting that you're not a smart guy, because those are not easy to tell it.
[01:48:01.038 --> 01:48:01.879]  But the thing is...
[01:48:03.004 --> 01:48:08.386]  That this, you're doing theater when you should be doing debate, which would be great.
[01:48:08.406 --> 01:48:09.827]  It's not honest.
[01:48:11.408 --> 01:48:13.268]  What you do is partisan hackery.
[01:48:13.328 --> 01:48:14.889]  And I'll tell you why I know it.
[01:48:14.909 --> 01:48:19.251]  You're on your show, and you sniff his throne, and you're accusing us of partisan hackery?
[01:48:19.351 --> 01:48:19.891]  Absolutely.
[01:48:20.031 --> 01:48:21.472]  You've got to be kidding me!
[01:48:21.512 --> 01:48:22.792]  You're on CNN.
[01:48:22.872 --> 01:48:26.854]  The show that leads into me is puppets making crank phone calls.
[01:48:27.674 --> 01:48:28.855]  What is wrong with you?
[01:48:29.215 --> 01:48:35.839]  Well, I'm just saying, there's no reason for you, when you have this marvelous opportunity not to be the guy's butt boy, to go ahead and be his butt boy.
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:38.221]  I was absolutely his butt boy.
[01:48:38.241 --> 01:48:40.022]  You would not believe what he ate two weeks ago.
[01:48:40.042 --> 01:48:45.746]  You know, the interesting thing that I have is, you have a responsibility to the public discourse.
[01:48:46.246 --> 01:48:48.828]  And you fail miserably, I think.
[01:48:49.188 --> 01:48:50.249]  You need to go to one.
[01:48:50.749 --> 01:48:51.950]  The thing that I want to say is,
[01:48:52.688 --> 01:48:57.393]  When you have people on for just knee-jerk, reactionary talk... Wait, I thought you were going to be funny.
[01:48:57.513 --> 01:48:58.234]  Come on.
[01:48:58.394 --> 01:49:00.216]  No, no, I'm not going to be your monkey.
[01:49:00.236 --> 01:49:01.998]  Go ahead, go ahead.
[01:49:02.879 --> 01:49:05.101]  I watch your show every day, and it kills me.
[01:49:05.121 --> 01:49:06.182]  I can tell you what it is.
[01:49:06.382 --> 01:49:07.744]  Oh, it's so painful to watch.
[01:49:07.764 --> 01:49:09.606]  You know...
[01:49:10.379 --> 01:49:11.680]  Because we need what you do.
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:18.187]  This is such a great opportunity you have here to actually get politicians off of their marketing and strategy.
[01:49:18.547 --> 01:49:21.430]  It's someone who watches your show and cannot take it anymore.
[01:49:21.450 --> 01:49:22.231]  I just can't.
[01:49:22.251 --> 01:49:23.872]  What's it like to have dinner with you?
[01:49:23.892 --> 01:49:25.053]  It must be excruciating.
[01:49:25.073 --> 01:49:26.275]  Do you lecture people like this?
[01:49:26.315 --> 01:49:27.956]  Do you come over to their house and sit and lecture them?
[01:49:27.976 --> 01:49:29.137]  They're not doing the right thing.
[01:49:29.177 --> 01:49:31.780]  They're missing their opportunities, evading their responsibilities.
[01:49:32.020 --> 01:49:32.861]  If I think they are.
[01:49:33.341 --> 01:49:33.582]  Look!
[01:49:34.302 --> 01:49:35.503]  I wouldn't want to eat with you, man.
[01:49:35.523 --> 01:49:36.083]  That's horrible.
[01:49:36.184 --> 01:49:36.964]  I know, and you won't.
[01:49:37.264 --> 01:49:39.266]  But the thing I want to get to... We did promise naked fishes.
[01:49:39.346 --> 01:49:39.906]  All right, folks.
[01:49:39.986 --> 01:49:40.767]  Let's get to those.
[01:49:41.087 --> 01:49:42.268]  We're going to get a break.
[01:49:42.368 --> 01:49:43.248]  See, that's not news.
[01:49:43.268 --> 01:49:47.491]  This has been big news, 60 minutes of the show about it, and it's them insulting each other.
[01:49:48.012 --> 01:49:51.034]  And Stewart didn't bring up any real points, which he could have.
[01:49:51.114 --> 01:49:52.154]  I'd tear those guys up.
[01:49:54.600 --> 01:50:02.007]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:50:02.267 --> 01:50:07.011]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:50:07.232 --> 01:50:12.877]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:50:13.117 --> 01:50:17.639]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:50:17.859 --> 01:50:25.022]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:50:25.042 --> 01:50:29.523]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.723 --> 01:50:32.244]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:50:32.464 --> 01:50:39.247]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[01:50:53.354 --> 01:51:01.618]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:01.878 --> 01:51:06.239]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:15.443]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:15.643 --> 01:51:19.265]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:51:19.545 --> 01:51:24.592]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:24.893 --> 01:51:31.622]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:32.103 --> 01:51:32.644]  What about you?

[01:52:56.275 --> 01:53:02.316]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:02.716 --> 01:53:05.877]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:08.338 --> 01:53:12.579]  About ten minutes into the next hour, we're going to have Victoria Collier joining us about the bug scanning.
[01:53:13.119 --> 01:53:18.060]  Then we've got Tex Mars coming on for about 30 minutes to talk about the history, the real history of Halloween and the election and all the rest of it.
[01:53:18.869 --> 01:53:25.214]  We won't go to those guests until we've gone to Jack and Johnny and Dave that have been holding the longest, and we'll get to everybody else with a guest.
[01:53:25.754 --> 01:53:27.095]  And yes, a bunch of other news is coming up.
[01:53:27.896 --> 01:53:33.560]  And then later I'm going to air the last couple minutes of this thing on Crossfire.
[01:53:33.580 --> 01:53:36.682]  But the reason I played it is, this is big news, 60-minute specials about it.
[01:53:37.102 --> 01:53:41.125]  Tucker Carlson making five-year-old jokes at...
[01:53:43.476 --> 01:53:50.403]  Stewart, and Stewart making comments back at him, and then accusing him of not doing real reporting while making jokes about everything.
[01:53:51.284 --> 01:53:59.231]  So what they do is they have the complete media lies, and they allow some real news with a liberal slant on it, put out by a comedian, and say, oh, well, see, it's all still just a joke.
[01:54:00.052 --> 01:54:01.173]  So, yes, it is a joke.
[01:54:01.213 --> 01:54:02.634]  The whole thing is a joke.
[01:54:03.255 --> 01:54:05.497]  And that little exchange is not major news.
[01:54:06.518 --> 01:54:08.480]  Before we go to Jack in Texas and others...
[01:54:09.571 --> 01:54:15.800]  Just briefly, PrisonPlanet.tv for internet users, 15 cents a day, all my videos, a bunch of other videos.
[01:54:16.081 --> 01:54:18.845]  We put up like four or five new videos this week alone.
[01:54:20.291 --> 01:54:20.591]  Okay?
[01:54:20.912 --> 01:54:24.035]  TV shows, other documentaries, audio reports.
[01:54:25.036 --> 01:54:25.897]  It's just amazing.
[01:54:25.917 --> 01:54:28.799]  50 cents a day, prisonplanet.tv if you're online.

[01:54:42.673 --> 01:54:43.474]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:54:43.494 --> 01:54:47.898]  My new American Dictators video is low as 595, folks, for a 115-minute film.
[01:54:48.179 --> 01:54:49.380]  I just want to get it out to people.
[01:55:01.748 --> 01:55:08.013]  So again, my friends, InfoWars.com or 1-888-253-3139.
[01:55:09.254 --> 01:55:10.735]  Jack in Texas, welcome!
[01:55:10.775 --> 01:55:11.515]  How you doing, Jack?
[01:55:12.776 --> 01:55:14.317]  Alex, my friend, how are you doing today?
[01:55:14.377 --> 01:55:14.738]  Good!
[01:55:15.318 --> 01:55:17.239]  Now I finally got a chance to call into your program.
[01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:18.480]  That's right, I've been calling into yours.
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:19.081]  What's going on?
[01:55:19.101 --> 01:55:22.243]  Hey, I just wanted to make a quick comment on this Red Sox thing.
[01:55:22.263 --> 01:55:28.828]  I didn't know if you were aware there was a new development from some of the post-game assemblies, you know,
[01:55:29.614 --> 01:55:37.759]  And one of those was a New Hampshire photographer was arrested for taking a picture of a police dog attacking one of the innocent bystanders.
[01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:40.321]  Yeah, I saw that report.
[01:55:40.401 --> 01:55:48.466]  So again, after they kill somebody, then they come out and say we're banning news coverage, but that's citizens and mainstream reporters being able to report.
[01:55:48.846 --> 01:55:54.430]  Yeah, on the other hand, on The Apprentice last night, it was a full hour of glorifying the New York City police, so...
[01:55:55.734 --> 01:55:59.235]  Showing all their helicopters and all of their military gear.
[01:55:59.255 --> 01:56:00.915]  It was quite entertaining, of course.
[01:56:00.935 --> 01:56:02.956]  You know, Jack, I've got the report somewhere here in the stack.
[01:56:02.996 --> 01:56:06.816]  With that particular New Hampshire reporter being arrested, where did you get that article?
[01:56:07.436 --> 01:56:11.117]  I actually saw it on CNN or one of the cable news outlets.
[01:56:11.217 --> 01:56:18.139]  But basically, yeah, he was taking a picture of one of the people out celebrating being innocently attacked by a police dog.
[01:56:18.199 --> 01:56:19.359]  But see what this implies?
[01:56:19.799 --> 01:56:21.159]  And I experienced this in New York.
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:24.320]  This implies now that you're bad and evil.
[01:56:25.332 --> 01:56:26.353]  If you're out with a camera.
[01:56:27.494 --> 01:56:31.477]  Yeah, I was jammed up many times in New York by taking pictures.
[01:56:31.517 --> 01:56:33.519]  I don't know how you got all the great footage you did.
[01:56:33.559 --> 01:56:36.321]  I guess it was a little bit luck and even more confidence.
[01:56:36.341 --> 01:56:37.162]  You had a good crew over there.
[01:56:37.182 --> 01:56:39.423]  I just said you don't need to see our identification papers.
[01:56:39.443 --> 01:56:40.704]  These aren't the droids you're looking for.
[01:56:40.724 --> 01:56:45.528]  I had Secret Service two or three times come and tell me to erase my film and they were going to arrest me.
[01:56:45.988 --> 01:56:49.251]  I did ask them once, what happens if I'm just on the street taking pictures?
[01:56:49.651 --> 01:56:53.893]  Well, I'm really glad that at least our tax money for Homeland Security is paying off in some aspect anyway, Alex, right?
[01:57:09.429 --> 01:57:09.929]  Absolutely.
[01:57:10.029 --> 01:57:10.870]  It's amazing.
[01:57:10.890 --> 01:57:12.010]  The borders are wide open.
[01:57:12.050 --> 01:57:14.291]  There are terrorist cells all over the place.
[01:57:14.311 --> 01:57:16.612]  They're reporting guys with backpacks coming over the borders.
[01:57:16.932 --> 01:57:21.353]  I've talked to people on the border saying Middle Eastern men are constantly coming over the borders.
[01:57:21.793 --> 01:57:27.075]  We talked to Mary Schneider, who of course uncovered a ring over here to give citizenship to terrorists.
[01:57:27.355 --> 01:57:30.476]  Just on the news today, two terrorists registered to vote in Ohio.
[01:57:31.056 --> 01:57:38.239]  But then again, they've got to search 89-year-old grandmothers, taser pregnant women, and check on Rubik's Cube, the toy factories.
[01:57:38.812 --> 01:57:40.952]  You're with Al Qaeda, third hour coming up.
[01:57:43.833 --> 01:57:44.393]  Terrorists!
[01:57:50.094 --> 01:57:50.755]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.395 --> 01:57:52.495]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.175 --> 01:57:54.315]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.335 --> 01:57:55.776]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.796 --> 01:57:57.376]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.396 --> 01:58:01.997]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.237 --> 01:58:06.318]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.521 --> 01:58:19.970]  Yeah, for those of you that are wondering what Homeland Security's up to, what they're doing right now, Rubik's Cube's patent ran out, so a Washington-based company started making their own Rubik's Cube, Magic Cube.
[01:58:20.270 --> 01:58:21.511]  But they didn't go after the factory.
[01:58:21.551 --> 01:58:27.055]  Homeland Security went to a local toy store selling it and threatened them with Homeland Security arrests.
[01:58:27.095 --> 01:58:28.456]  She said, weren't you over terrorism?
[01:58:28.476 --> 01:58:28.916]  They said, no.
[01:58:29.336 --> 01:58:30.537]  Infrastructure protection.
[01:58:30.577 --> 01:58:31.438]  We're over everything.
[01:58:32.185 --> 01:58:44.795]  And then, of course, after they killed Snellgrove last week at the Red Sox won that particular series, now they were out when they won the World Series and had police dogs attacking people and arresting news reporters.
[01:58:45.135 --> 01:58:47.277]  The mayor said, you can't have news cameras on the streets.
[01:58:47.297 --> 01:58:48.258]  That causes a problem.
[01:58:49.078 --> 01:58:52.521]  And so reporters were being arrested when they would catch police dogs chewing on people.
[01:58:53.101 --> 01:58:54.002]  So this is a new freedom.
[01:58:54.022 --> 01:58:57.525]  We're going to beat you, and you're not going to have cameras, but we're going to have lots of cameras.
[01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:08.555]  We're about to go to Johnny in Hawaii, but Jack in Texas, you were going to also talk about this new terror alert, a white guy with a New Jersey accent.
[01:59:09.542 --> 01:59:11.643]  Yeah, Alex, they say white men can't jump.
[01:59:11.663 --> 01:59:14.545]  Well, apparently white men can't make Al-Qaeda videos either.
[01:59:14.565 --> 01:59:16.806]  A very bad actor making it.
[01:59:16.846 --> 01:59:19.227]  It's almost a comical terror video.
[01:59:19.268 --> 01:59:19.948]  I'm going to get you.
[01:59:19.968 --> 01:59:20.788]  One will run.
[01:59:21.109 --> 01:59:21.949]  I hate George Bush.
[01:59:22.369 --> 01:59:26.351]  Another story brought to you by the Drudge Report, which I guess is the new Al Jazeera.
[01:59:26.412 --> 01:59:28.853]  It's amazing these guys have websites, of course, that are...
[01:59:29.193 --> 01:59:31.194]  Put up by American servers.
[01:59:31.234 --> 01:59:33.075]  I mean, it's absolutely incredible.
[01:59:33.095 --> 01:59:38.858]  But the globalists, obviously, have run out of beautiful Middle Eastern men and idiots to make their terror videos.
[01:59:39.038 --> 01:59:39.378]  U.S.
[01:59:39.458 --> 01:59:40.819]  government servers, sometimes.
[01:59:41.659 --> 01:59:42.960]  Yeah, I mean, it's really pathetic, too.
[01:59:43.020 --> 01:59:45.321]  I mean, you can really see this guy's a white guy.
[01:59:45.361 --> 01:59:48.822]  He's got, I mean, it almost sounds like an overdub with the voice.
[01:59:48.862 --> 01:59:53.425]  But the guy's obviously a Caucasian, you know, making this video.
[01:59:53.485 --> 01:59:54.525]  And it's really pathetic.
[01:59:54.805 --> 01:59:56.586]  And they use these terror videos, Alex.
[01:59:56.706 --> 01:59:58.287]  I'm going to get you.
[01:59:58.667 --> 02:00:15.133]  And Friday morning, so that the media can get behind America on every Sunday show, how great Bush is with Homeland Security, how we need to re-elect him to keep him safe, and we've seen reports that correlate exactly to this effect, that when they scare people and put out these videos, his poll numbers go up, Alex.
[02:00:15.433 --> 02:00:15.793]  I hear you.
[02:00:15.813 --> 02:00:16.414]  Thanks for the call.
[02:00:16.694 --> 02:00:16.934]  Right on.
[02:00:16.954 --> 02:00:17.534]  Keep the faith, man.
[02:00:17.554 --> 02:00:18.334]  Good to hear from you.
[02:00:18.394 --> 02:00:20.075]  Let's talk to Johnny in Hawaii.
[02:00:21.286 --> 02:00:22.106]  How you doing, Johnny?
[02:00:22.446 --> 02:00:23.267]  Hey, thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:00:24.887 --> 02:00:28.728]  In Hawaii, we've been able to vote absentee since October 18th.
[02:00:28.888 --> 02:00:41.612]  I don't know if other states do this, but what that means is you can actually go into a polling place, like a satellite city hall, fill out a form, and you can vote either by paper ballot or by electronic machine.
[02:00:42.772 --> 02:00:45.273]  And this goes on until the 30th.
[02:00:45.853 --> 02:00:48.694]  Well, I did my voting yesterday, and I did electronic voting.
[02:00:49.673 --> 02:00:55.018]  So I went to the booth, and the machine is made by Hart InterCivic, which is based there in Austin.
[02:00:55.198 --> 02:00:56.539]  Yeah, that's Clear Channel, yeah.
[02:00:56.920 --> 02:01:09.451]  Yeah, and I did a little bit of research on the Hart machine, and one article popped up about the company falsifying tests, falsifying security statements that they made about the machine.
[02:01:09.471 --> 02:01:11.573]  Hey, don't worry about that.
[02:01:12.694 --> 02:01:13.354]  Yeah.
[02:01:14.075 --> 02:01:16.217]  And I went to another site,
[02:01:16.795 --> 02:01:31.439]  And they said that they have proprietary software that operates the voting procedure, but it's interfaced on the front and back with Microsoft so that the officials can interface with it and do their own tallies and make up their own ballots.
[02:01:32.679 --> 02:01:34.560]  So it looks to me like...
[02:01:36.277 --> 02:01:38.299]  You just have a big scam here with voting also.
[02:01:38.979 --> 02:01:41.802]  Well, you should just trust the government, okay?
[02:01:41.982 --> 02:01:42.302]  I should.
[02:01:42.563 --> 02:01:45.225]  Engineers have quit these companies and said it's all a fraud.
[02:01:45.265 --> 02:01:46.186]  Let's just ignore them.
[02:01:46.746 --> 02:01:48.508]  They've been caught hiring convicted felons.
[02:01:48.868 --> 02:01:50.770]  Diebold has to run elections.
[02:01:51.251 --> 02:01:52.291]  Just ignore it, okay?
[02:01:53.032 --> 02:01:56.796]  Also, Art, I found out they're working with Dell Computers, too.
[02:01:58.097 --> 02:02:01.360]  Both companies have merged to make this latest machine.
[02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:02.060]  Of course.
[02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:02.601]  They haven't.
[02:02:03.584 --> 02:02:04.765]  That's what we used yesterday.
[02:02:04.945 --> 02:02:06.246]  This is the latest one.
[02:02:06.306 --> 02:02:09.469]  It looks like a big PDA with a thumb wheel on it.
[02:02:10.250 --> 02:02:11.591]  That's what we've got here in Austin.
[02:02:11.911 --> 02:02:13.512]  Yeah.
[02:02:13.633 --> 02:02:17.256]  So I figure they can just manipulate the system here like they can everywhere else.
[02:02:17.536 --> 02:02:20.618]  But don't try to go out and videotape police as they use police dogs on people.
[02:02:20.639 --> 02:02:21.679]  They'll have to arrest you, too.
[02:02:22.020 --> 02:02:22.460]  I know it.
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:23.941]  Might be with Al-Qaeda, buddy.
[02:02:24.462 --> 02:02:24.882]  Yeah.
[02:02:26.183 --> 02:02:26.864]  All right, Johnny.
[02:02:26.884 --> 02:02:27.524]  Good to hear from you.
[02:02:27.564 --> 02:02:28.045]  Good points.
[02:02:29.221 --> 02:02:31.404]  Good old Hart InterCivics, owned by Clear Channel.
[02:02:31.424 --> 02:02:34.469]  And then here they ran Michael McCall, who's married to the owner of Clear Channel's daughter.
[02:02:35.170 --> 02:02:38.115]  And Lowry May has just so happened to be his biggest contributor, too.
[02:02:38.135 --> 02:02:41.139]  You own the machines, your son-in-law runs on.
[02:02:42.101 --> 02:02:43.062]  It's all good.
[02:02:48.047 --> 02:02:53.508]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:53.948 --> 02:02:58.189]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:02:58.409 --> 02:03:05.451]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:05.831 --> 02:03:11.913]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:12.073 --> 02:03:13.293]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:13.453 --> 02:03:13.954]  We're good to go.
[02:03:30.410 --> 02:03:33.554]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[02:03:33.574 --> 02:03:33.614]  866-885-6625.
[02:03:33.634 --> 02:03:33.674]  866-885-6625.
[02:03:33.915 --> 02:03:34.856]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:03:34.876 --> 02:03:35.076]  Call today.
[02:03:46.713 --> 02:03:51.216]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:51.556 --> 02:03:55.658]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:55.958 --> 02:03:56.499]  We listened.
[02:03:56.799 --> 02:04:01.802]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:02.062 --> 02:04:02.542]  We listened.
[02:04:02.943 --> 02:04:05.964]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:06.405 --> 02:04:06.905]  We listened.
[02:04:07.385 --> 02:04:11.448]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:04:11.828 --> 02:04:12.328]  We listened.
[02:04:12.668 --> 02:04:17.912]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:04:18.312 --> 02:04:19.693]  Again, we listened.
[02:04:20.033 --> 02:04:27.438]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:04:27.818 --> 02:04:32.201]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888.
[02:04:34.462 --> 02:04:35.902]  8-803-4438.
[02:04:36.282 --> 02:04:40.223]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:04:40.243 --> 02:04:43.164]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:43.584 --> 02:04:49.365]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:04:49.585 --> 02:04:54.006]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:04:54.166 --> 02:04:58.527]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:04:58.567 --> 02:04:59.927]  The New World Order.
[02:05:01.715 --> 02:05:05.936]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:05:05.996 --> 02:05:12.917]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:05:13.037 --> 02:05:15.098]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:05:15.418 --> 02:05:25.880]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:05:26.060 --> 02:05:28.620]  If you want to understand what the new order really is, then my
[02:05:29.080 --> 02:05:29.320]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:30.921]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:05:53.198 --> 02:05:54.299]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.939 --> 02:05:55.800]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.521 --> 02:05:58.442]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.462 --> 02:06:01.964]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.265 --> 02:06:06.407]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.229 --> 02:06:15.214]  Yeah, the police for a long time have been looking for reasons to make you shut your video cameras off on city streets.
[02:06:15.294 --> 02:06:17.555]  And now they're murdering people up in Boston.
[02:06:17.575 --> 02:06:18.296]  They went back out.
[02:06:18.965 --> 02:06:28.031]  When the Red Sox won the World Series and attacked the crowds even more viciously, bullets now lodged in people's sinus cavities, rubber bullets, you name it.
[02:06:28.051 --> 02:06:40.758]  And yeah, I've got the article here where a New Hampshire, what, AP Stringer reporter with a camera got a police dog, he said, biting somebody savagely, ripping their leg open, and the cops just came over and grabbed his camera and took it all away.
[02:06:41.739 --> 02:06:47.022]  So now, they got all their cameras looking at you, but buddy, you don't bring a camera out here and cover what we're doing.
[02:06:47.688 --> 02:06:50.190]  Covering our faces up with black masks isn't enough.
[02:06:50.210 --> 02:06:51.291]  Because we're the good guys.
[02:06:51.812 --> 02:06:52.993]  We don't want cameras either.
[02:06:53.073 --> 02:06:54.034]  You understand us?
[02:06:54.654 --> 02:06:57.597]  You've got to learn how to serve the man.
[02:06:57.617 --> 02:07:00.519]  There's a new boss in town, slaves.
[02:07:01.540 --> 02:07:04.663]  I know we've got Dan and Wes and Ian and Michael and many, many others.
[02:07:04.683 --> 02:07:05.323]  We'll get to your calls.
[02:07:06.084 --> 02:07:08.066]  Just for a few segments here is Victoria Collier.
[02:07:08.086 --> 02:07:14.271]  Her father and uncle wrote VoteScan with the preeminent experts on the old-line vote fraud that the Democrats and others had pulled.
[02:07:15.166 --> 02:07:17.768]  And now it's gotten more sophisticated with the electronic voting machines.
[02:07:17.828 --> 02:07:25.715]  And to give us her perspective on this from her catbird seat, her crow's nest looking down at all this, is Victoria Cullier.
[02:07:26.235 --> 02:07:27.476]  And it's good to have you on, Victoria.
[02:07:27.737 --> 02:07:28.037]  Hi, Alex.
[02:07:28.077 --> 02:07:28.958]  How are you doing?
[02:07:29.658 --> 02:07:34.922]  I'm doing just fine watching America turn into a Nazi Germany nightmare.
[02:07:35.263 --> 02:07:39.686]  Tell us about your website and tell us what your observations are on the 2004 election.
[02:07:40.127 --> 02:07:43.229]  Yeah, well, the website is votescam.com.
[02:07:44.486 --> 02:07:49.788]  And, of course, probably most of your listeners know they can buy the book there and the video there as well.
[02:07:51.748 --> 02:08:01.131]  What you just mentioned, though, about the sort of old-line vote fraud, actually, vote scam deals with electronic voting fraud.
[02:08:01.191 --> 02:08:04.712]  Electronic voting fraud has been going on, well, ever since the advent of
[02:08:05.322 --> 02:08:10.883]  Yeah, no, no, I mean, they have scantrons they put in the machine, and that's digitized and manipulated.
[02:08:10.903 --> 02:08:21.586]  Yeah, so people need to realize that these touchscreen machines that everybody's freaking out about now, they are the latest and best incarnation in computerized... Because the old one left a paper trail.
[02:08:21.786 --> 02:08:22.026]  Right.
[02:08:22.626 --> 02:08:27.487]  And that was, you know, that was not handy when it came to rigging elections, that you needed a...
[02:08:28.254 --> 02:08:30.897]  A better way to rig elections through computers.
[02:08:30.957 --> 02:08:34.760]  And the only way to improve upon the system is to get rid of the ballot altogether.
[02:08:35.281 --> 02:08:36.402]  And that's what they've done now.
[02:08:36.642 --> 02:08:40.446]  And that finally, I think, crossed the line for a lot of Americans who are
[02:08:40.996 --> 02:08:50.218]  Blissfully ignorant before this, and then even the most ignorant among us couldn't help but notice the obvious... Hey, I get a receipt at an ATM.
[02:08:50.298 --> 02:08:54.439]  Hey, there's a record of what I did with the grocery store now.
[02:08:54.740 --> 02:08:56.220]  But I can't with my vote?
[02:08:56.240 --> 02:08:59.241]  And they go, hey, we have men in black ski masks with machine guns.
[02:08:59.361 --> 02:09:00.201]  Don't protest.
[02:09:00.501 --> 02:09:01.141]  Shut up.
[02:09:01.381 --> 02:09:02.442]  Yeah.
[02:09:02.462 --> 02:09:04.562]  Just shut up and go to our prisons.
[02:09:05.762 --> 02:09:06.303]  Basically.
[02:09:06.663 --> 02:09:07.643]  Yeah, that's the sentiment.
[02:09:07.743 --> 02:09:07.863]  So...
[02:09:09.013 --> 02:09:15.738]  There is a pretty massive movement against these voting machines, the touchscreens in particular.
[02:09:15.758 --> 02:09:18.180]  Hey, little lady, stop speaking out against it!
[02:09:18.420 --> 02:09:19.161]  Accept it!
[02:09:20.062 --> 02:09:24.625]  But it's not going to get anywhere before the next election next week.
[02:09:24.725 --> 02:09:33.071]  So we are going to be using, I think, about 30% of the votes are going to be counted on these touchscreen machines that don't have a paper trail.
[02:09:33.852 --> 02:09:36.334]  And that's what we're facing for next week.
[02:09:36.474 --> 02:09:37.214]  That's 35%, isn't it?
[02:09:38.749 --> 02:09:39.710]  Is it 35 now?
[02:09:40.110 --> 02:09:40.470]  Maybe.
[02:09:40.491 --> 02:09:45.735]  You know, there's a lot of battles going on at the last minute in counties all across the country.
[02:09:45.875 --> 02:09:49.197]  And there's examples of fraud as usual popping up everywhere.
[02:09:49.238 --> 02:09:49.598]  Everywhere.
[02:09:49.678 --> 02:09:50.138]  So what?
[02:09:51.059 --> 02:09:51.439]  Everywhere.
[02:09:52.400 --> 02:10:03.389]  You know, I'd like to mention to your listeners, if they're particularly interested in this issue, they can subscribe to a newsletter service online called Rad Times, R-A-D-T-I-M-E-S.
[02:10:05.385 --> 02:10:10.119]  And they can email resistatbest.com Okay, what does that do?
[02:10:10.300 --> 02:10:11.163]  They will get sent...
[02:10:11.960 --> 02:10:18.184]  All of the pertinent articles only about the computerized voting fraud issue from all around the world.
[02:10:18.925 --> 02:10:24.148]  I don't know who's behind it, but it's a wonderful service for me because I don't have the time to go searching the net to find out.
[02:10:24.228 --> 02:10:27.170]  Well, Bev Harris at blackboxvoting.org also posts that stuff.
[02:10:27.450 --> 02:10:29.432]  Yeah, and she probably gets it through Rad Times.
[02:10:30.012 --> 02:10:32.394]  I don't know who's behind it, but it's real helpful.
[02:10:32.454 --> 02:10:35.556]  And Bev Harris' website, of course, too, blackboxvoting.org.
[02:10:36.176 --> 02:10:38.999]  Maybe we should have the Italian government grab all these websites.
[02:10:39.019 --> 02:10:46.545]  You know, they just did that a few weeks ago with Indymedia, and they just said, we're a foreign government, we don't like your speech, under global rules, we're taking your websites down.
[02:10:47.265 --> 02:10:48.947]  So are you telling people to vote, Alex?
[02:10:50.728 --> 02:11:00.597]  I think that just to go in and have the experience and see what it's like and look at it for themselves, and if it's not an electronic machine, they should still go in and do it, but that's up to each individual.
[02:11:01.517 --> 02:11:02.098]  What are you saying?
[02:11:02.816 --> 02:11:08.100]  Yeah, well, I'm having this discussion with a lot of people, and I'm certainly not telling people not to vote.
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:19.108]  Because the point that's being made to me that I think is true is that it is harder for them to get away with it when more and more people are voting and paying attention to the process.
[02:11:19.268 --> 02:11:29.495]  Even if we can't monitor these computerized voting machines, which we can't, I think that the individuals behind the vote rigging are feeling heat on them that they've never felt before.
[02:11:29.675 --> 02:11:31.556]  And I think that there can be division and...
[02:11:33.017 --> 02:11:36.838]  Well, we've already been having this.
[02:11:36.898 --> 02:11:40.699]  We had up in Green Bay, they post the fake AP article about Bush already winning.
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:46.841]  We have in 98, somebody inside ABC posts almost the exact same vote totals for the nation.
[02:11:46.861 --> 02:11:49.002]  I mean, we're having all these leakers.
[02:11:49.422 --> 02:11:51.983]  We've had engineers quit Dybul and say it's all a fraud.
[02:11:52.003 --> 02:11:55.024]  We've caught them with vice presidents who are computer crimes felons.
[02:11:55.724 --> 02:11:57.445]  I mean, all this stuff is coming out.
[02:11:57.645 --> 02:11:58.625]  Right, it is coming out.
[02:11:59.426 --> 02:12:09.697]  And so what I feel is that although these machines are more riggable than any other machine previously used, they aren't necessarily going to be rigged.
[02:12:10.158 --> 02:12:12.981]  It's very possible, likely in fact, that they will be.
[02:12:13.041 --> 02:12:17.426]  But if we can put enough pressure, enough heat on the entire machine,
[02:12:17.706 --> 02:12:24.492]  I've got a plan, as they say.
[02:12:24.512 --> 02:12:25.433]  You want to hear my plan?
[02:12:25.493 --> 02:12:26.334]  I'd like to hear your plan.
[02:12:26.374 --> 02:12:28.776]  I've talked about it, maybe for this election, the next election, whatever.
[02:12:29.417 --> 02:12:32.239]  You pick a precinct in your town.
[02:12:32.279 --> 02:12:34.641]  You have you and a couple hundred of your friends all go vote.
[02:12:35.082 --> 02:12:37.604]  Put down a record of how you voted when you come out.
[02:12:38.357 --> 02:12:45.378]  And then go, and don't tell anybody, and then go watch and see if that precinct reports in with the numbers you knew that you put into it.
[02:12:46.079 --> 02:12:47.459]  That's one plan to document.
[02:12:48.379 --> 02:13:01.582]  Another plan, and to prove fraud, another thing to do is to demand a paper ballot recall, where you sign petitions in every town, to have a paper ballot recall of the electronic voting machines.
[02:13:02.322 --> 02:13:07.303]  But you can't, all the touch screen machines are going to do is spit out a total.
[02:13:08.263 --> 02:13:09.664]  That's all they're going to do.
[02:13:09.684 --> 02:13:17.567]  But then you catch them, let's say really only 1,000 people voted in the precinct, and then you go, wait, we've got 200 people go vote in there, and you're only showing 300 voted for Billy Bob Johnson.
[02:13:19.088 --> 02:13:21.529]  There's ways to document this.
[02:13:22.789 --> 02:13:35.215]  Well, you know, one potential scenario that might be coming, because of course there are thousands of lawyers massing on both sides, preparing for what everyone's saying is going to be pretty much chaos on Election Day.
[02:13:36.248 --> 02:13:49.299]  If the election is called into dispute, and we don't have a president within a month or so after election day... If it's called into dispute, we're not going to ever be able to have a real recount in 35% of the country?
[02:13:49.319 --> 02:13:53.102]  No, we would have to have another election, and we'd have to do it on paper ballots.
[02:13:53.925 --> 02:13:54.586]  That's the only way.
[02:13:54.606 --> 02:13:55.567]  Of course, that's not going to happen.
[02:13:55.587 --> 02:13:57.649]  The Supreme Court's going to appoint our president again.
[02:13:57.849 --> 02:14:04.355]  Well, and it looks like that's in the works, but obviously, you know, they're not going to be able to do it a second time, and there are people who are preparing.
[02:14:04.995 --> 02:14:08.078]  I mean, did you read the Ronnie Duggar article in The Nation?
[02:14:08.098 --> 02:14:12.062]  I mean, it was nearly hysterical, and I've... No, I didn't read it.
[02:14:12.102 --> 02:14:12.683]  What did he say?
[02:14:12.763 --> 02:14:13.183]  Well, he...
[02:14:14.795 --> 02:14:24.581]  He's normally a pretty staid guy, but he was calling for people to prepare to mass in the streets after Election Day if Bush is in again.
[02:14:24.601 --> 02:14:29.844]  And then the cops are going to come out and ban cameras and kill people and then say how good they are.
[02:14:30.504 --> 02:14:34.166]  Yeah, but nevertheless... That'll teach you not to protest!
[02:14:34.186 --> 02:14:36.588]  This call is really going out there.
[02:14:36.688 --> 02:14:40.930]  I can see a lot of chaos after Election Day.
[02:14:41.010 --> 02:14:44.012]  Well, basically, that's what the Eminem video implies.
[02:14:44.844 --> 02:14:45.545]  I haven't seen that.
[02:14:45.565 --> 02:14:47.786]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:14:48.626 --> 02:14:50.528]  Well, you know, we'll see what I have.
[02:14:50.648 --> 02:14:52.489]  I can't call what's going to happen next week.
[02:14:52.529 --> 02:14:52.849]  I can't.
[02:14:52.869 --> 02:15:11.481]  But if the election is fully disputed, if the machines malfunction, if they're hacked into, any of these things, then the only answer to that is maybe just in the counties where these machines are used, perhaps, to get another vote in with some kind of paper that can actually be recounted.
[02:15:12.188 --> 02:15:20.432]  But it might not come to that, or we could see some kind of chaos in this country that we haven't ever seen in our lifetime.
[02:15:20.452 --> 02:15:21.632]  Well, Victoria, I'll say this.
[02:15:22.753 --> 02:15:24.633]  Bush and Kerry are on the same ticket.
[02:15:24.733 --> 02:15:29.676]  It's a staged WWF wrestling spectacular.
[02:15:30.196 --> 02:15:31.496]  I think they want riots.
[02:15:31.616 --> 02:15:32.817]  I think they want crises.
[02:15:33.911 --> 02:15:53.724]  You know, it's funny because I'm having so many discussions with people who feel the way I do, that it's a one-party system and obviously the way you do too, but people are trying to figure out whether there is enough of a difference between Bush and Kerry to make it worth it to fight for Kerry's victory.
[02:15:53.764 --> 02:15:54.304]  You know what?
[02:15:54.584 --> 02:15:55.365]  Kerry is different.
[02:15:55.385 --> 02:15:56.466]  He wants more troops.
[02:15:57.386 --> 02:15:58.847]  He wants to invade more countries.
[02:15:59.948 --> 02:16:02.189]  Yeah, that's kind of how I've been looking at it.
[02:16:04.567 --> 02:16:14.138]  But anyway, for the listeners you've got who aren't familiar with the vote scam investigation, I should probably just mention it since that's what I'm here to talk about.
[02:16:15.399 --> 02:16:23.469]  The investigation is important still because it's totally relevant to what's going on right now and people need to understand the history.
[02:16:24.860 --> 02:16:33.746]  A vote fraud investigation in this country because we're hearing so much now about vote fraud and computerized rigging and all of this stuff that most people are totally unfamiliar with.
[02:16:33.786 --> 02:16:35.147]  Victoria, I'll tell you what.
[02:16:35.667 --> 02:16:37.989]  We've got another guest coming up and I want to get these calls.
[02:16:38.009 --> 02:16:39.610]  I just wanted to have you up for a quick report.
[02:16:39.930 --> 02:16:48.176]  Maybe I can get you back up Monday or Tuesday to do the history of vote fraud for an hour that your father and uncle really broke in voter news services.
[02:16:48.316 --> 02:16:49.637]  Right, yeah.
[02:16:49.717 --> 02:16:52.259]  But people can find that out at your website.
[02:16:52.279 --> 02:16:52.739]  Tell them about it.
[02:16:52.839 --> 02:16:53.960]  And then that's what I'm saying.
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:55.601]  Just take a look at the website.
[02:16:55.621 --> 02:17:04.567]  The first five chapters of the book are up online, and people can get a sense of how long computers have been used to rig votes in America.
[02:17:04.607 --> 02:17:06.108]  And that's votescam.com?
[02:17:06.608 --> 02:17:07.629]  Votescam.com.
[02:17:07.909 --> 02:17:11.671]  And are you predicting Lord Bush will be our next president, come hook or crook?
[02:17:12.252 --> 02:17:14.013]  No, I'm not, but I'm not going to call it.
[02:17:14.153 --> 02:17:17.235]  I'm calling it, if I had to, I think, for Kerry.
[02:17:18.331 --> 02:17:19.692]  Well, we're going to find out on Monday.
[02:17:19.712 --> 02:17:21.213]  Can I get you on on Monday for an hour?
[02:17:21.233 --> 02:17:21.793]  Sure.
[02:17:22.373 --> 02:17:23.934]  All right, well, we'll get you on then.
[02:17:24.074 --> 02:17:25.195]  Victoria, thanks for coming on.
[02:17:25.215 --> 02:17:26.075]  All right, thanks.
[02:17:26.255 --> 02:17:27.076]  I appreciate you.
[02:17:27.656 --> 02:17:28.456]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:28.476 --> 02:17:33.939]  I'll let our guests go so we can talk to David and Wes and Ian and Michael and others.
[02:17:33.979 --> 02:17:35.400]  We'll come back and take your calls.
[02:17:35.420 --> 02:17:41.543]  And then we've got Tex Mars joining us to talk about Halloween, your Christian holiday.
[02:17:42.124 --> 02:17:43.985]  PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowars.com.
[02:17:46.269 --> 02:17:47.791]  Be a part of the new gold rush.
[02:17:48.232 --> 02:17:52.558]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[02:17:52.959 --> 02:17:53.840]  It still is.
[02:17:54.441 --> 02:17:57.946]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[02:17:58.266 --> 02:18:00.069]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[02:18:00.630 --> 02:18:02.673]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[02:18:03.231 --> 02:18:05.252]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[02:18:05.632 --> 02:18:13.295]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[02:18:13.675 --> 02:18:17.456]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.

[02:19:49.591 --> 02:19:54.754]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[02:19:55.666 --> 02:20:02.549]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[02:20:03.609 --> 02:20:12.192]  If so, why has Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?

[02:21:16.543 --> 02:21:17.664]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[02:21:17.824 --> 02:21:18.584]  Which are collectible?

[02:21:54.480 --> 02:21:56.260]  You'll hear us at 9.985 for those shortwave listeners.
[02:21:56.280 --> 02:21:56.260]  9.985.
[02:21:56.300 --> 02:21:57.021]  Same frequency at night, 3210.
[02:21:57.061 --> 02:21:57.361]  9 to midnight.
[02:21:57.401 --> 02:21:57.621]  Next Monday, 9.985.
[02:21:57.661 --> 02:21:59.282]  Next time you hear me on shortwave, it'll be there.
[02:21:59.302 --> 02:21:59.282]  9.985.
[02:21:59.322 --> 02:21:59.942]  Pass it on.
[02:22:13.812 --> 02:22:16.454]  Tex Mars is coming up to talk about Halloween, the history of Halloween.
[02:22:16.794 --> 02:22:19.396]  But right now, let's talk to David in Illinois.
[02:22:19.436 --> 02:22:19.936]  You're on the air.
[02:22:19.977 --> 02:22:20.397]  Go ahead.
[02:22:20.857 --> 02:22:21.458]  Yes, Alex.
[02:22:21.858 --> 02:22:22.078]  Yes.
[02:22:22.498 --> 02:22:29.443]  I want to talk about a program that Homeland Insecurity is trying to, or actually got started here in my neck of the woods here.
[02:22:30.124 --> 02:22:35.168]  Have you heard of anything called CERT, C-E-R-T, Citizens Emergency Response Teams?
[02:22:35.328 --> 02:22:37.209]  Yeah, those are part of the Tattletail Squads.
[02:22:37.929 --> 02:22:41.372]  Well, I just went through their training, and of course, the training is nice to know.
[02:22:41.452 --> 02:22:42.693]  It's honorable, but
[02:22:43.109 --> 02:22:53.835]  I remember you saying, I guess it was a week or so ago, about the group in Texas that they basically does the same thing, but they have them all of a sudden take gun training and riot control and all this stuff.
[02:22:54.035 --> 02:22:54.315]  Yes.
[02:22:54.715 --> 02:23:00.098]  And I'm just curious, I mean, what is, you know, like I say, on the surface, this whole program sounds very admirable.
[02:23:00.618 --> 02:23:01.258]  No, it does.
[02:23:01.338 --> 02:23:04.600]  It gets you involved, and then, oh, by the way, we're going to go stop rioting citizens.
[02:23:05.281 --> 02:23:07.662]  Or we're going to go do forced inoculations.
[02:23:07.962 --> 02:23:09.803]  Well, our instructor said there was...
[02:23:10.390 --> 02:23:16.312]  There was additional training available for us, but he didn't elaborate or tell us when or where, what would be going.
[02:23:16.352 --> 02:23:24.193]  But I'm just curious, you know, he told her instructor said that this was supposed to be a nationwide program.
[02:23:24.974 --> 02:23:30.295]  Yeah, they've got Secure Corps for the kids, CERT for adults, and they've got the State Guards, the National Guards.
[02:23:31.395 --> 02:23:33.256]  And it's bad news, my friend.
[02:23:33.276 --> 02:23:37.877]  Well, I'm just curious if we were going to be the ones going door to door looking for the guns and the weapons.
[02:23:38.391 --> 02:23:40.913]  You're definitely being put into that cadre, yes.
[02:23:41.634 --> 02:23:46.857]  No, I tell you, if it comes to that, basically I will drop out.
[02:23:46.978 --> 02:23:50.740]  But, like I say, I... Well, it's good to have good people inside there.
[02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:52.842]  Oh, yeah, but, I mean, the training is good.
[02:23:54.003 --> 02:23:59.167]  The training to help in case of a tornado or something, search and rescue, it's nice to know.
[02:23:59.547 --> 02:24:00.247]  Yeah.
[02:24:00.287 --> 02:24:03.630]  Did you hear me read the AP article where Homeland Security is going to toy stores?
[02:24:04.010 --> 02:24:04.351]  Oh, yeah.
[02:24:04.631 --> 02:24:04.851]  Oh, yeah.
[02:24:05.509 --> 02:24:08.491]  Why exactly are they afraid of Rubik's Cube?
[02:24:08.771 --> 02:24:12.814]  Well, they say that it might still be under patent, and the person isn't even making them.
[02:24:12.834 --> 02:24:15.316]  They're just selling them, and they don't go to the company that sells them.
[02:24:15.336 --> 02:24:16.537]  We have to go to you and threaten you.
[02:24:16.817 --> 02:24:18.038]  She said, well, isn't this for terrorism?
[02:24:18.058 --> 02:24:18.598]  She said, yes.
[02:24:19.238 --> 02:24:21.700]  Homeland Security deals with the entire economy, see?
[02:24:22.020 --> 02:24:22.300]  Yeah.
[02:24:22.881 --> 02:24:23.281]  Everything.
[02:24:23.801 --> 02:24:26.103]  Oh, you're talking about the new shortwave frequency.
[02:24:26.944 --> 02:24:33.428]  There's a very strong rumor going around that a major shortwave radio manufacturer might be getting out of business.
[02:24:33.748 --> 02:24:34.809]  Well, that was Grundig.
[02:24:35.685 --> 02:24:36.906]  I've heard maybe Sony.
[02:24:37.606 --> 02:24:38.947]  Oh, well, I don't know.
[02:24:39.327 --> 02:24:39.927]  Thanks for the call.
[02:24:39.987 --> 02:24:45.891]  Grundig got out of business about six months ago, so the radios are out there at a low and decreased price.
[02:24:46.411 --> 02:24:48.392]  Wes in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[02:24:48.452 --> 02:24:48.952]  Go ahead.
[02:24:50.733 --> 02:24:51.333]  Hello, Wes.
[02:24:51.594 --> 02:24:51.814]  Hi.
[02:24:51.974 --> 02:24:54.455]  I'm sorry I wasn't... That's okay.
[02:24:54.475 --> 02:24:54.795]  Go ahead.
[02:24:54.815 --> 02:24:55.496]  You're on the air, sir.
[02:24:56.836 --> 02:25:03.420]  I just wanted to say I saw the Forbidden movie, Stolen Honor, yesterday.
[02:25:04.168 --> 02:25:06.809]  And it's absolutely heart-wrenching.
[02:25:06.869 --> 02:25:07.530]  It really is.
[02:25:07.730 --> 02:25:20.756]  And it really shows in the clearest detail what a real-life, low-life, scum, son-of-a-gun Terry is.
[02:25:21.436 --> 02:25:25.018]  Terry is absolutely horrible, just like his cousin Bush.
[02:25:25.058 --> 02:25:26.399]  I mean, it's two peas in a pod.
[02:25:26.639 --> 02:25:27.279]  They really are.
[02:25:27.819 --> 02:25:29.080]  They're both bottom feeders.
[02:25:29.180 --> 02:25:32.462]  But I'll tell you, I'm predicting Bush 53...
[02:25:34.867 --> 02:25:35.868]  53 to 47.
[02:25:35.908 --> 02:25:36.189]  53% to 47%.
[02:25:36.249 --> 02:25:43.340]  Yeah, they'll have to give him a big lead to make it all look legitimate.
[02:25:44.041 --> 02:25:44.962]  Yeah, I'm saying 6% lead.
[02:25:44.982 --> 02:25:45.222]  53 to 47.
[02:25:45.262 --> 02:25:45.302]  So...
[02:25:49.577 --> 02:25:50.237]  We'll wait and see.
[02:25:50.617 --> 02:25:50.917]  All right.
[02:25:50.937 --> 02:25:52.638]  In the meantime, God bless and keep up the good work.
[02:25:52.798 --> 02:25:53.778]  Thanks for the call, Wes.
[02:25:54.498 --> 02:25:57.319]  Yeah, Kerry's just... I mean, don't think because I say Kerry would be better.
[02:25:57.359 --> 02:26:02.981]  He'd be better because he's so bad, conservatives will wake up and start fighting the agenda that Bush has brought in.
[02:26:03.001 --> 02:26:05.121]  You're going to get the exact same agenda from both of them.
[02:26:05.261 --> 02:26:06.081]  It doesn't matter.
[02:26:06.802 --> 02:26:08.262]  And I'm not saying go vote for Kerry.
[02:26:08.302 --> 02:26:09.482]  Go vote for Michael Perutka.
[02:26:10.102 --> 02:26:11.603]  Let's talk to Ian in Canada.
[02:26:11.703 --> 02:26:12.423]  Ian, you're on the air.
[02:26:12.483 --> 02:26:12.803]  Welcome.
[02:26:13.403 --> 02:26:15.884]  Yeah, before I make an observation about...
[02:26:16.853 --> 02:26:19.075]  The vote in 2000 and the upcoming vote.
[02:26:19.195 --> 02:26:27.760]  Peter Jennings this morning on CBC Radio News said that his network and the others will no longer be using voter news service.
[02:26:27.780 --> 02:26:30.903]  Yeah, they changed the name, but it'll just be a news scam.
[02:26:31.163 --> 02:26:31.763]  That's what I thought.
[02:26:31.783 --> 02:26:34.845]  You might ask Vicki what she knows about that on Monday.
[02:26:35.506 --> 02:26:41.910]  But I just wanted to say, I don't think there's much point in losing a lot of emotional energy over the numerical vote.
[02:26:42.406 --> 02:26:50.170]  You'll remember that in 96, John Zogby was giving Clinton a 7% lead when everybody else was giving him anywhere from 12 to 20%.
[02:26:51.050 --> 02:26:53.911]  And John Zogby hit it right on the nose in 96.
[02:26:54.112 --> 02:27:04.416]  In 2000, up until about 24 to 48 hours before the election, he was giving Bush a 5% lead and then sort of withdrew his numbers.
[02:27:04.937 --> 02:27:09.119]  And nothing more was said, and we had that electoral chaos following the vote.
[02:27:09.499 --> 02:27:10.379]  Yeah.
[02:27:10.539 --> 02:27:11.200]  I just think that...
[02:27:12.446 --> 02:27:12.706]  Yes, sir.
[02:27:36.067 --> 02:27:36.970]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.472 --> 02:27:39.077]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.688]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:53.662]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:54.102 --> 02:27:58.343]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:27:58.563 --> 02:28:05.605]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:05.985 --> 02:28:12.067]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:12.227 --> 02:28:13.447]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:13.627 --> 02:28:14.108]  We're good to go.

[02:29:45.191 --> 02:29:48.233]  Dad, that cocoon stuff really got rid of your gray hair.
[02:29:48.414 --> 02:29:54.939]  I'm that 44-year-old guy you've heard talking about taking Cocoon GH and how it helped reverse my gray hairs.
[02:29:55.059 --> 02:29:56.860]  And here's some more great news.
[02:29:56.980 --> 02:30:00.463]  Taking Cocoon GH can improve your life in many ways.
[02:30:00.603 --> 02:30:05.066]  Cocoon basically repairs your body to a youthful state you perhaps had 10 or 20 years ago.
[02:30:06.187 --> 02:30:08.749]  I'm taking Cocoon GH, and here's what I notice.
[02:30:08.909 --> 02:30:14.313]  After a few sprays in my mouth, I'm in peak condition mentally, emotionally, and physically.
[02:30:14.433 --> 02:30:17.395]  In the state I get from Cocoon, I feel unstoppable.
[02:30:17.695 --> 02:30:19.517]  And you can have the same feeling.
[02:30:19.757 --> 02:30:29.704]  If you're tired, run down, want to boost your sexual performance, want to help wipe out back pain or arthritis, you need to start taking Cocoon GH right now.
[02:30:30.024 --> 02:30:34.127]  If you want similar results, call now to order Cocoon GH.

[02:30:35.128 --> 02:30:37.269]  800-814-5031 800-814-5031 800-814-5031 They railed against the crowd Another ragtag band
[02:31:03.819 --> 02:31:07.920]  All right, this is out of England, the Daily Post, North Wales.
[02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:12.482]  Halloween history, bobbing for apples, trick-or-treat, carving jack-o'-lanterns.
[02:31:12.502 --> 02:31:16.343]  Halloween has many weird and wonderful traditions, but why do we have them at all?
[02:31:16.543 --> 02:31:25.426]  Despite popular belief that Halloween is just another American import, trick-or-treat is actually a very British and European affair for thousands of years, the ancient Celts.
[02:31:27.073 --> 02:31:33.276]  Celebrated Halloween, or Samhain, as it truly was known, as one of the most important dates of the Celtic faith.
[02:31:34.056 --> 02:31:36.418]  Like us, the Celts divided the year into four seasons.
[02:31:37.098 --> 02:31:44.782]  It says that the pagan year ended with the first of November due to the fact that they were followed by the agricultural year, which began and ended in autumn.
[02:31:46.303 --> 02:31:49.365]  In Gaelic, Samhain actually means summer's end.
[02:31:50.106 --> 02:32:01.393]  And this was the time of celebration when the dead were encouraged to return to the great feast where the living... In Ireland, this was known as the Fahid na Marbad, or Feast of the Dead.
[02:32:01.413 --> 02:32:03.454]  And they also have it in Mexico at this very same time.
[02:32:03.774 --> 02:32:05.275]  The devil has his holiday everywhere.
[02:32:06.039 --> 02:32:07.280]  And then you go over here.
[02:32:07.340 --> 02:32:10.021]  This is out of the Scotsman Halloween Ceremony.
[02:32:10.322 --> 02:32:12.243]  Hardin's Executed Witches from 400 years ago.
[02:32:12.263 --> 02:32:17.026]  They're going to have a little ceremony there in Scotland to talk about this.
[02:32:17.586 --> 02:32:19.827]  Here's one out of the Associated Press today.
[02:32:19.847 --> 02:32:23.029]  It says, Nation World.
[02:32:23.109 --> 02:32:26.371]  History of Halloween dates back to Ireland 2,000 years ago.
[02:32:26.391 --> 02:32:31.134]  And it says, The Celts practiced a pagan religion known as Druidism.
[02:32:32.208 --> 02:32:37.194]  And it goes on, the Celts priests and wizards called Druids were well educated in astrology and magic.
[02:32:37.655 --> 02:32:44.022]  During Samhain, the Druids built large bonfires and often burned human sacrifices.
[02:32:44.422 --> 02:32:47.226]  And people were executed in practice to honor the Druid gods.
[02:32:48.775 --> 02:32:55.042]  The Celts believed all laws of space and time were separated during this time, allowing the spirit world to intermingle with the living.
[02:32:55.263 --> 02:32:58.827]  That's why a lot of kids are always found dead with their guts and hearts cut out.
[02:32:59.147 --> 02:33:00.889]  It'll be in the back of the paper around the country.
[02:33:01.330 --> 02:33:08.278]  Murders and crimes at record levels in the week leading up to Halloween when the real sacrifices are going on.
[02:33:09.577 --> 02:33:16.100]  And they wouldn't allow this to really go on until the 1950s when, well, TV came in and it was popularized again.
[02:33:16.481 --> 02:33:28.887]  And joining us is our police professor, Tex Mars, Air Force officer, also a pastor, best-selling author, just for the next 25 minutes or so, to give us a little bit more than what the Associated Press is telling us.
[02:33:29.627 --> 02:33:33.270]  Tex, I remember five years ago being called a kook talking about this.
[02:33:33.310 --> 02:33:35.332]  It didn't exist even when the encyclopedia said it.
[02:33:35.712 --> 02:33:43.559]  Now they're admitting it all but saying, even in these articles, that a lot of people have revived the actual rituals to worship the earth.
[02:33:44.279 --> 02:33:49.724]  So now they're even saying it's kind of a good thing right next to talking about human sacrifices, Professor Mars.
[02:33:50.625 --> 02:33:52.526]  Yes, they are, Alex.
[02:33:52.926 --> 02:33:56.950]  Of course, I believe it's because witchcraft is so very popular now.
[02:33:58.310 --> 02:34:05.852]  And it's, of course, memorialized in television shows and books for children and so forth, cartoons.
[02:34:06.492 --> 02:34:09.273]  So it's really become a more commonplace thing.
[02:34:09.933 --> 02:34:14.074]  But certainly Halloween is one of the more important witchcraft holidays.
[02:34:15.654 --> 02:34:21.135]  There really are eight major Sabbaths or holidays on the witchcraft calendar.
[02:34:21.476 --> 02:34:23.016]  And this is one of the more important ones.
[02:34:23.096 --> 02:34:27.437]  And what you said, I think it's very interesting that this is a day
[02:34:29.564 --> 02:34:35.807]  We look at it as just a day of, you know, a lot of kids do, and parents of partying, having good time.
[02:34:36.568 --> 02:34:48.474]  But, you know, somehow there's some kind of a compartmentalization where you dress kids like devils and then you don't think it's going to affect them.
[02:34:49.135 --> 02:34:56.859]  But some years ago I was reading a witch's newsletter put out by a church of Wicca.
[02:34:58.037 --> 02:35:07.000]  And they were asked the question, do they worship Halloween, or as you just mentioned, So Wayne, as their religious holiday?
[02:35:07.100 --> 02:35:10.521]  And I'd like to give their response.
[02:35:11.301 --> 02:35:21.024]  They stated, quote, Yes, many followers, such as Druids and Wiccans, as we are, observe this day as a religious festival.
[02:35:21.684 --> 02:35:25.605]  We view it as a memorial day for our dead friends.
[02:35:26.514 --> 02:35:31.096]  Similar to the American National Holiday of Memorial Day in May.
[02:35:31.777 --> 02:35:42.382]  It is a night to practice various forms of witchcraft divination concerning future events, and it is a time to initiate new projects.
[02:35:43.543 --> 02:35:54.769]  Well, of course, when we look at witchcraft as a whole, and the history of it, Alex, we know this is an unholy night where witches covens meet, drink, dance, spit out curses and spells.
[02:35:55.347 --> 02:36:02.713]  Conjure up spirits, engage in sexual orgies, offer up animal and human sacrifices.
[02:36:02.733 --> 02:36:05.776]  Now, I'm not saying every witch's coven does that.
[02:36:05.916 --> 02:36:07.857]  Well, this is, you talk about plain view.
[02:36:07.877 --> 02:36:20.508]  I mean, look, it may have been right here in the Associated Press that when your child goes trick or treat, if you didn't put out proper offerings to the druidic ruling class...
[02:36:21.542 --> 02:36:28.328]  Then they would come back and take your chickens or your cow or maybe one of your children, and every year they would come and demand somebody's child.
[02:36:28.828 --> 02:36:33.853]  Sometimes they were so into this, even a nobleman would say, I want to sacrifice myself.
[02:36:33.913 --> 02:36:34.573]  It was a great honor.
[02:36:34.593 --> 02:36:39.337]  And they'd get them drunk and then bash their brains out and then throw them into a fire or throw them into a peat bog.
[02:36:39.878 --> 02:36:41.059]  This is the type of stuff that went on.
[02:36:41.079 --> 02:36:42.440]  And I argue with these wickets.
[02:36:42.460 --> 02:36:43.141]  I'll get a bunch of e-mails.
[02:36:43.161 --> 02:36:46.123]  They go, we're a loving earth group.
[02:36:46.163 --> 02:36:49.186]  Well, Anton LaVey laughed at them and said, you fools, you know,
[02:36:49.972 --> 02:36:51.553]  The black magic is what it's all about.
[02:36:51.773 --> 02:36:53.773]  You are in the lower levels being deceived.
[02:36:54.734 --> 02:36:55.294]  Absolutely.
[02:36:55.554 --> 02:37:01.176]  They like to claim, of course, there's a difference between black witchcraft and white witchcraft and those kinds of things.
[02:37:01.656 --> 02:37:02.696]  You're right.
[02:37:03.357 --> 02:37:06.658]  Both Michael Aquino and Anton LaVey did laugh at them.
[02:37:07.218 --> 02:37:14.360]  And Michael Aquino of the Temple of Seth, the satanic church... Psychological warfare expert for the U.S.
[02:37:14.420 --> 02:37:14.640]  Army.
[02:37:14.740 --> 02:37:15.201]  That's right.
[02:37:15.241 --> 02:37:16.281]  He was a colonel of the U.S.
[02:37:16.341 --> 02:37:16.581]  Army.
[02:37:17.221 --> 02:37:19.142]  And Aquino said that we...
[02:37:20.287 --> 02:37:28.892]  In the Temple of Set of the Church of Satan, believe just like these people do, but we have a, quote, more precise grip on things.
[02:37:28.912 --> 02:37:30.973]  In other words, we understand it better.
[02:37:31.013 --> 02:37:36.696]  In other words, they practice occultism, Satanism, in ignorance.
[02:37:37.216 --> 02:37:40.378]  But according to Aquino, they still practice it.
[02:37:41.558 --> 02:37:48.302]  And all of these things, the evil of witchcraft, of black magic rituals and activities, going all the way back, as you mentioned...
[02:37:48.789 --> 02:37:51.931]  To the self, the druids, and so forth.
[02:37:52.271 --> 02:38:02.797]  And by the way, there was an article in the San Antonio Express newspaper, it's been a few years ago, but I'm sure it can still be researched and it is true today.
[02:38:02.817 --> 02:38:17.625]  It's a very unpleasant thing, but many humane society shelters, Alex, many humane society shelters across the United States, they close off adoption activities of animals and pets
[02:38:18.830 --> 02:38:27.737]  In the two weeks leading up to Halloween, because they have found so many pets are adopted at these Humane Society shelters.
[02:38:27.777 --> 02:38:29.778]  Yeah, and a lot of them are into this.
[02:38:29.879 --> 02:38:30.779]  Let me just tell you something.
[02:38:30.799 --> 02:38:31.640]  They're sacrificed.
[02:38:31.660 --> 02:38:34.342]  They're adopted only to be sacrificed.
[02:38:34.842 --> 02:38:46.211]  And the San Antonio police said that they would find remains after Halloween, they would find remains of animals that are sacrificed throughout the greater San Antonio area.
[02:38:49.051 --> 02:38:58.994]  And then also, I know you have a big file, so do I, of mainstream articles, but always in the back of the paper, a child found, and in the footnote, you know, the cops usually try to keep the details quiet for the investigation.
[02:38:59.014 --> 02:39:00.074]  They got their hearts cut out.
[02:39:01.174 --> 02:39:01.714]  Absolutely.
[02:39:02.054 --> 02:39:12.317]  Usually, you know, these things are not discussed because not only are they grotesque and distasteful, but the prosecutors say it's a matter of just murder.
[02:39:13.312 --> 02:39:13.732]  Or not.
[02:39:13.812 --> 02:39:15.933]  So we don't want to bring in the more sensationalist aspects.
[02:39:15.973 --> 02:39:24.076]  I've had an Austin Police Department detective tell me about eight years ago, face-to-face, he says, you wouldn't believe how many crime scenes for Satanism, and we're told, don't discriminate, don't bring it up.
[02:39:25.117 --> 02:39:25.557]  That's right.
[02:39:25.637 --> 02:39:28.878]  Yeah, because there are witches now, by the way.
[02:39:29.338 --> 02:39:42.363]  Many of the witch organizations have groups that they founded, much like the Jewish ADL or the ACLU, that will actually bring lawsuits against people who supposedly defame or slander people.
[02:39:42.702 --> 02:39:43.683]  We're good to go.
[02:39:57.549 --> 02:40:01.211]  And they begin to do little spells and rituals and think of themselves as a witch.
[02:40:01.592 --> 02:40:06.094]  Yeah, they're not really, but they're definitely getting into the lesser magic end of it, into the dark world.
[02:40:06.555 --> 02:40:13.519]  But Harry Potter, Scholastic, selling more than the Bible right now, being put into the public schools.
[02:40:14.199 --> 02:40:16.321]  They bust them for free viewings of it at the movie theater.
[02:40:16.881 --> 02:40:20.303]  The snake demon kills the unicorn and drinks its blood.
[02:40:21.864 --> 02:40:22.164]  I mean, is it...
[02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:28.263]  But you can't talk about Jesus Christ or Yahweh in the public schools.
[02:40:29.744 --> 02:40:32.906]  Well, that's right, because it's interesting.
[02:40:33.786 --> 02:40:39.089]  I remember some years ago, somebody phoned me and told me that in the L.A.
[02:40:39.210 --> 02:40:45.774]  area there that a witch had been invited from the Church of Wicca to talk to their child's middle school class.
[02:40:46.994 --> 02:40:52.778]  And they called, now listen to this, they called the ACLU and said that a
[02:40:53.391 --> 02:40:53.872]  I think so.
[02:41:08.610 --> 02:41:14.234]  And the lady that they talked to got on the line at ACLU, and she was excited.
[02:41:14.754 --> 02:41:16.896]  She wanted all the information.
[02:41:17.256 --> 02:41:20.358]  She said, we will go to this school district and put a stop to this.
[02:41:20.839 --> 02:41:34.288]  She was very adamant about it, and as she began to take down the information, and she found out that it was a witchcraft minister, but an actual licensed witch of a tax-exempt church, the Church of Wicca,
[02:41:34.975 --> 02:41:40.457]  And it was part of the school, you know, the school had officially invited this witch right before Halloween.
[02:41:40.977 --> 02:41:47.280]  But suddenly with the ACLU found out that it was a witch, immediately said, oh no, no, no, we're not interested in going against this.
[02:41:47.980 --> 02:41:49.601]  And hung up the phone on the individual.
[02:41:50.041 --> 02:41:51.982]  So you're right, if it's a Christian minister, of course...
[02:41:52.498 --> 02:41:54.401]  And Jesus, that can't be taught in schools.
[02:41:54.441 --> 02:41:57.726]  Not even the Ten Commandments can be put on walls of schools.
[02:41:57.966 --> 02:42:00.470]  But it's okay to teach devilry and witchcraft.
[02:42:00.630 --> 02:42:07.721]  Again, we're talking to TexMars, TexMars.com, ConspiracyWorld.com, or ConspiracyPlanet.com, correct?
[02:42:08.536 --> 02:42:10.317]  It's actually conspiracyworld.com.
[02:42:10.337 --> 02:42:11.357]  Good, I got it right the first time.
[02:42:11.377 --> 02:42:12.317]  No problem.
[02:42:12.477 --> 02:42:13.737]  But I want to explain this.
[02:42:14.057 --> 02:42:16.058]  In the New York Police Department, they've got a Koran.
[02:42:16.078 --> 02:42:25.740]  Out in California and all the public schools, they have a month where you practice being a Muslim and have to do the five prayers a day for all the kids.
[02:42:26.741 --> 02:42:27.981]  It's any other religion.
[02:42:28.021 --> 02:42:29.541]  It's Greek gods in the courthouse.
[02:42:29.601 --> 02:42:31.822]  It's any religion but Islam.
[02:42:32.717 --> 02:42:34.138]  Well, I think it's only right.
[02:42:34.158 --> 02:42:38.881]  It's only right that this be the case, because it is Christianity that stands out from the crowd.
[02:42:59.844 --> 02:43:01.225]  Well, let me shift gears for a minute.
[02:43:27.086 --> 02:43:29.989]  They have an article here out of the Scotsman Halloween Ceremony.
[02:43:30.629 --> 02:43:39.036]  Pardons executed witches, a talent to the mark of Halloween, by officially pardoning anyone witches executed more than 400 years ago, it emerged today.
[02:43:39.436 --> 02:43:43.059]  The pardons were granted under ancient feudal powers due to be abolished within weeks.
[02:43:43.639 --> 02:43:55.288]  Descendants of the namesakes of those put to death in the town of Prestopons, east of Lothan, during Scotland's 16th and 17th century witch hunts, are expected to attend Sunday ceremony.
[02:43:55.308 --> 02:43:58.551]  Let me break this down from my studies, and I want to see if we concur, Tex.
[02:43:58.571 --> 02:43:59.792]  We haven't talked before this interview.
[02:44:00.252 --> 02:44:03.295]  From my studies, it was actually the devil worshippers...
[02:44:03.735 --> 02:44:15.185]  Going out generally killing innocent people and torturing them publicly and having open ceremonies in the name of Christianity, practicing Satanism openly, in many cases against real Christians.
[02:44:15.825 --> 02:44:16.486]  Have you found that?
[02:44:18.047 --> 02:44:24.373]  Well, if you mean that there are men and women masquerading as Christian ministers...
[02:44:25.430 --> 02:44:27.071]  That are actually devil worshippers?
[02:44:27.131 --> 02:44:40.242]  Yes, and that a lot of these so-called operations that we hear about, oh, the persecution of witches and people, in reality that was just a political tool, and in many cases, I know when they've investigated these inquisitioners and others, it turns out that they themselves indeed were Satanists.
[02:44:41.283 --> 02:44:43.845]  I think that's very interesting, that that might be the case.
[02:44:44.786 --> 02:44:48.329]  And I can certainly understand that would be the case.
[02:44:48.629 --> 02:44:51.852]  Well, I've seen a lot of indicators, and perhaps I should give you my info on it, but...
[02:44:52.901 --> 02:44:56.522]  Well, you know, Alex, here's what people have to understand.
[02:44:58.963 --> 02:45:04.945]  You know, Satan must attempt to pollute and undermine the Christian church.
[02:45:05.065 --> 02:45:08.766]  And you can do that just like attempting to undermine America.
[02:45:08.826 --> 02:45:16.689]  We now have neoconservatives, so-called, really, or Trotskyites and others who are sabotaging America.
[02:45:17.401 --> 02:45:22.203]  Undermining our government from within and high office in the Pentagon and so forth.
[02:45:22.223 --> 02:45:24.964]  We have counterfeits of every group and every organization.
[02:45:25.664 --> 02:45:26.185]  Absolutely.
[02:45:26.465 --> 02:45:27.245]  And there's no doubt.
[02:45:27.385 --> 02:45:37.329]  I cannot tell you how many letters I've received over the years from especially wives who reveal things about their husbands.
[02:45:38.249 --> 02:45:41.431]  Methodists, Lutherans, other pastors, literally pastors.
[02:45:41.771 --> 02:45:42.991]  These are not crazy women.
[02:45:43.031 --> 02:45:44.772]  These are women who are fed up.
[02:45:45.767 --> 02:45:54.972]  And finally decided they needed help because their husbands were into satanic activities but were masquerading as pastors.
[02:45:55.773 --> 02:46:00.355]  Now, I have researched this, and I'll tell you, I found out something quite dramatic.
[02:46:00.935 --> 02:46:13.302]  Most people do not know that during the Vietnam War era, there were some 10 million young men who were able to evade military service
[02:46:13.908 --> 02:46:17.451]  By claiming to be ministers or ministerial students.
[02:46:18.111 --> 02:46:21.614]  This was a very popular... For a while, the government allowed this.
[02:46:21.654 --> 02:46:31.721]  In other words, all you had to do is show them some ordination certificate or license that you were a licensed minister and you could avoid military service.
[02:46:32.242 --> 02:46:35.184]  There was even a group called the Universal Life Church.
[02:46:35.564 --> 02:46:38.366]  For $10, you could buy an ordination certificate.
[02:46:39.087 --> 02:46:42.229]  And millions of young men avoided military service.
[02:46:42.309 --> 02:46:43.150]  Draft Dodgers.
[02:46:44.111 --> 02:46:47.173]  Now, many of them went on to go to divinity school or seminary.
[02:46:47.714 --> 02:46:48.655]  They hated God.
[02:46:48.815 --> 02:46:49.996]  They hated Christianity.
[02:46:50.476 --> 02:46:57.881]  But they went for a full three or four years to seminary, knowing then they would never have to serve in the U.S.
[02:46:58.001 --> 02:46:59.022]  Army and be shot at.
[02:46:59.663 --> 02:47:05.147]  Now, then they went on to become Methodist, Baptist, Lutheran, Episcopal, and so forth.
[02:47:05.567 --> 02:47:09.470]  They are now in their 50s in age, okay?
[02:47:09.510 --> 02:47:09.910]  Some of them 55, 60, 45.
[02:47:12.847 --> 02:47:17.273]  We're talking about the leaders in most major denominations.
[02:47:17.393 --> 02:47:19.516]  It's not just the Catholic Church.
[02:47:19.556 --> 02:47:20.657]  It's full of a bunch of devils.
[02:47:21.218 --> 02:47:21.858]  Absolutely.
[02:47:22.219 --> 02:47:24.322]  The churches are full of devils.
[02:47:24.762 --> 02:47:27.205]  And some people say, well, Tex, what are you trying to say?
[02:47:27.726 --> 02:47:30.750]  I'm trying to say, buyer beware.
[02:47:31.334 --> 02:47:36.136]  And it may very well be we're at an age where we'll have to go back to... I'm not saying every church.
[02:47:36.176 --> 02:47:36.736]  That's wrong.
[02:47:37.197 --> 02:47:39.938]  But there are a huge number of churches like this.
[02:47:40.418 --> 02:47:43.419]  Devil men, devil women running these churches.
[02:47:43.880 --> 02:47:47.301]  It may be we may have to go back to what the early church in the book of Acts did.
[02:47:47.781 --> 02:47:48.502]  Meet in homes.
[02:47:48.682 --> 02:47:49.922]  Go direct to God.
[02:47:50.142 --> 02:47:51.403]  Or hiding and meeting.
[02:47:51.423 --> 02:47:58.406]  Well, more and more from Texas to Colorado to Florida, the zoning people go after churches where there's four or five people in the house.
[02:47:59.170 --> 02:48:01.931]  Then they go, well, next door they're having a topless bar party.
[02:48:02.391 --> 02:48:06.211]  Well, that's okay if they've got 200 people at their house, but you can't have five people at your house.
[02:48:06.251 --> 02:48:10.572]  Tex, when we get back just briefly, how do you keep your children shielded from this?
[02:48:10.932 --> 02:48:15.393]  I mean, having them dress up like devils, having them run around and do all this, this is impressionistic.
[02:48:15.793 --> 02:48:24.715]  How do you keep yourself separate from this night of idolatry, of devilry?
[02:48:25.339 --> 02:48:30.424]  So we'll talk to Tex Mars of texmars.com and conspiracyworld.com when we get back.
[02:48:30.784 --> 02:48:32.386]  We'll wrap up this Friday edition.
[02:48:32.426 --> 02:48:33.827]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, of course.
[02:48:34.308 --> 02:48:39.473]  Then, of course, I'll be back next Monday and Tuesday with live coverage of the staged election of 2004.
[02:48:39.813 --> 02:48:40.534]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:45.942 --> 02:48:47.443]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.643 --> 02:48:50.724]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.864 --> 02:48:54.766]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.806 --> 02:48:59.027]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:48:59.388 --> 02:49:03.149]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.289 --> 02:49:05.070]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.390 --> 02:49:08.591]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[02:49:08.631 --> 02:49:13.353]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.513 --> 02:49:16.555]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.735 --> 02:49:19.596]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.076 --> 02:49:26.199]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.739 --> 02:49:28.842]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[02:49:45.493 --> 02:49:50.454]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.

[02:51:49.796 --> 02:51:51.337]  This show is documented.
[02:51:51.837 --> 02:51:54.640]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:55.040 --> 02:51:58.683]  I fell into... Hey, I wanted to play this clip real quick for text.
[02:51:58.703 --> 02:51:59.524]  I don't know if you've seen it.
[02:51:59.584 --> 02:52:01.165]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:52:01.745 --> 02:52:13.755]  It's Bush as he's running for governor, and he looks really agitated, and he's grabbing his head and squeezing his head and running his hands through his hair, and then he flips off the camera, and he just looks completely crazed.
[02:52:13.835 --> 02:52:16.016]  But you don't get that really from the audio, but you can go watch it.
[02:52:16.417 --> 02:52:17.798]  Here's the audio of Bush.
[02:52:18.425 --> 02:52:30.287]  He's still telling me what to do.
[02:52:30.307 --> 02:52:30.287]  5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[02:52:33.688 --> 02:52:35.208]  Just a one-finger victory salute.
[02:52:36.449 --> 02:52:38.809]  You know, Tex, I'm not for John Kerry or George Bush.
[02:52:38.949 --> 02:52:42.610]  Obviously, I'm more of a Republican-minded because of the so-called abortion stand.
[02:52:43.150 --> 02:52:43.810]  But Bush and...
[02:52:45.301 --> 02:52:46.683]  Almost a Clinton carrier.
[02:52:46.723 --> 02:52:48.024]  Cousins, Skull and Bones.
[02:52:48.464 --> 02:52:50.326]  I think this whole thing is completely staged.
[02:52:50.367 --> 02:52:50.887]  What do you think?
[02:52:51.868 --> 02:52:52.349]  It is.
[02:52:52.429 --> 02:52:58.656]  And, you know, genealogically, they're descended from European royalty and all of those things.
[02:52:58.756 --> 02:53:00.758]  Have you heard the new one, MSNBC?
[02:53:00.878 --> 02:53:03.040]  It is directly back to Blodney and Paylor.
[02:53:03.721 --> 02:53:04.442]  Isn't that interesting?
[02:53:04.482 --> 02:53:05.283]  Both of them, yeah.
[02:53:06.114 --> 02:53:07.055]  I think that's interesting.
[02:53:07.495 --> 02:53:11.278]  Bush's comment, he's talking about shooting the finger, of course.
[02:53:11.698 --> 02:53:13.859]  Yeah, the man is really a very crude man.
[02:53:13.879 --> 02:53:15.480]  He's not a Christian at all.
[02:53:15.841 --> 02:53:19.803]  I did a whole hour's program on my radio show exposing this.
[02:53:20.584 --> 02:53:29.169]  And this is certainly not Sport Carey, who, believe me, the skull and bones, many believe he was given the name Long Devil.
[02:53:29.650 --> 02:53:30.911]  And I think for good reason.
[02:53:31.291 --> 02:53:32.792]  He's a very dangerous man.
[02:53:33.252 --> 02:53:34.473]  As dangerous as
[02:53:35.191 --> 02:53:36.692]  I think it's important that we do that.
[02:53:36.712 --> 02:53:37.573]  You know, in the Bible,
[02:54:05.122 --> 02:54:07.885]  And I love the Word of God because it tells us exactly what to do.
[02:54:07.945 --> 02:54:12.208]  It tells us to not be unequally yoked with unbelievers.
[02:54:12.248 --> 02:54:19.435]  And it says, What communion hath light with darkness, and what concord hath Christ with Baal?
[02:54:19.735 --> 02:54:21.216]  You know, Baal was the fire god.
[02:54:21.776 --> 02:54:23.618]  And that's really what this is the worship of.
[02:54:24.639 --> 02:54:27.141]  I think Christians should keep their children from this.
[02:54:27.802 --> 02:54:32.726]  I remember a Christian mother called me on a talk show some years ago and was just castigating me
[02:54:33.659 --> 02:54:35.179]  It's just good fun.
[02:54:35.279 --> 02:54:37.240]  Why do you want to keep kids from having fun?
[02:54:37.660 --> 02:54:40.841]  And I asked her what her child would be dressing up as.
[02:54:41.401 --> 02:54:44.922]  She actually said, and this just shows I've got panel things.
[02:54:44.982 --> 02:54:48.182]  He orchestrated this conversation, this exchange.
[02:54:48.343 --> 02:54:56.464]  She said, and very almost shamefacedly probably on the other end of the phone, she said he will be dressing up as Jason.
[02:54:56.484 --> 02:54:58.765]  You know, Jason, the mass murderer, right?
[02:54:59.767 --> 02:55:03.009]  And I said, your little son, how old is he?
[02:55:03.029 --> 02:55:03.889]  She said he was seven.
[02:55:04.369 --> 02:55:09.632]  He's going to be dressing up as Jason, the mass murderer.
[02:55:09.732 --> 02:55:11.993]  And then simulating running around slaughtering people.
[02:55:12.033 --> 02:55:15.255]  Tex, give folks the toll-free number for a free copy of your great newsletter.

[02:55:40.273 --> 02:55:43.735]  Tex, thank you for coming on, and don't have a good Halloween.
[02:55:44.496 --> 02:55:44.936]  All right.

[02:55:47.097 --> 02:55:47.338]  You bet.

[02:55:48.318 --> 02:55:48.979]  Have a great weekend.
[02:55:50.019 --> 02:55:50.900]  Folks, we're out of time.

[02:55:52.341 --> 02:55:54.122]  Remember, next week, new shortwave frequency.

[02:55:59.042 --> 02:56:07.207]  And at night always, 3210, or on your local AM or FM dial, go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to get any of my premier documentary films.

[02:56:19.054 --> 02:56:25.018]  There's the Associated Press admitting human sacrifice on Halloween.
[02:56:25.458 --> 02:56:26.899]  I mean, do you want to be part of that, folks?
[02:56:27.420 --> 02:56:27.900]  That's murder.
[02:56:28.473 --> 02:56:28.654]  1-888-253-3139.
