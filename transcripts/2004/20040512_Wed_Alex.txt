[00:00:05.923 --> 00:00:06.564]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.224 --> 00:00:08.285]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:10.166]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.747 --> 00:00:11.567]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.348 --> 00:00:13.229]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:17.572]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.072 --> 00:00:22.195]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.560]  Alright, my friends.
[00:00:30.226 --> 00:00:40.592]  Let's not waste any time as we blast out coast to coast from Providence, Rhode Island to Los Angeles, California in our defense of liberty and our resistance to tyranny.
[00:00:41.953 --> 00:00:44.034]  It is Wednesday, the twelfth day of May, 2004.
[00:00:44.135 --> 00:00:46.536]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:47.016 --> 00:00:52.199]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:55.183 --> 00:01:16.089]  I have to be honest with you, my gut level instinct, which I don't go off of, I go off the facts and the evidence, but my gut level instinct yesterday afternoon when I heard about this poor Nick Berg, a civilian contractor getting his head cut off by some degenerate goons, while he was screaming and begging for his life, was, it's the globalists.
[00:01:16.269 --> 00:01:22.471]  But I said, no, there are a lot of crazies over there, you know, this is war, this is horrible, this could have happened.
[00:01:23.582 --> 00:01:32.706]  And then the first article I see out of the Associated Press says that he was in the Coalition's hands.
[00:01:34.046 --> 00:01:50.073]  They had grabbed him off the street, a white guy, no reason to do that, they had grabbed him off the street over there in Baghdad, actually north of Baghdad, and held him for 13 days, they were releasing, and that very same day,
[00:01:51.132 --> 00:01:54.295]  He gets captured by Al-Qaeda.
[00:01:54.715 --> 00:01:56.677]  L-C-I-A-D-A.
[00:01:57.398 --> 00:01:58.659]  We know Al-Qaeda's CIA.
[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.124]  And we know Mr. Chalibi was the head torture master for the Shah of Iran.
[00:02:04.164 --> 00:02:06.105]  He now runs Iraq.
[00:02:06.185 --> 00:02:07.747]  He's a convicted bank robber as well.
[00:02:08.908 --> 00:02:15.854]  We know it's Mr. Chalibi out running these staged victory parades whenever Saddam's statue topples.
[00:02:15.874 --> 00:02:17.455]  It's interesting Mr. Chalibi's over there.
[00:02:17.495 --> 00:02:18.176]  We have to remember that.
[00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:31.276]  And some chubby guys, not the normal skinny young Arab fighters, but some fat guys, sit there in front of this poor Mr. Berg, right in the middle of this whole scandal.
[00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:43.083]  And just cut his head off and then throw him out on the side of the road with a videotape and he's found by the very same coalition forces that had grabbed him to begin with.
[00:02:43.403 --> 00:02:47.244]  So, you go from the Fed's hands right into Al Qaeda's hands.
[00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:53.907]  Kind of like 9-11 with the FBI paying for the houses, the cars, the credit cards of the supposed hijackers who were trained at U.S.
[00:02:53.927 --> 00:02:54.707]  military bases.
[00:02:55.087 --> 00:02:57.488]  MSNBC, Pensacola News Journal, Associated Press.
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.883]  And then magically, you know, their passports fall out of the sky when all of their stuff's destroyed from the aircraft.
[00:03:05.064 --> 00:03:08.266]  Every time we see terrorists doing something, they've got globalist handlers.
[00:03:09.687 --> 00:03:13.188]  So, you know, the video, I struggled with posting this.
[00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:15.710]  We put it up for a little while yesterday and I thought, you know something?
[00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.400]  I'm just going to take this down.
[00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.421]  We put some of the stills of him cutting his head off up.
[00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:22.382]  Others have done that.
[00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:23.482]  What do you think?
[00:03:23.502 --> 00:03:25.943]  You think I should post on PrisonPlanet.tv?
[00:03:26.584 --> 00:03:29.025]  Third time I watched it, trying to analyze it.
[00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:33.507]  Look, I mean, this is real violence.
[00:03:33.527 --> 00:03:34.407]  This is in the movies.
[00:03:34.707 --> 00:03:38.869]  This is a guy just squealing like a trapped animal.
[00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:39.770]  Poor thing.
[00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:41.791]  They kill him like an animal.
[00:03:42.051 --> 00:03:46.393]  They need to get those Al-Qaeda pieces of filth, those CIA officers.
[00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:49.143]  ...that did this need to be brought to justice.
[00:03:49.844 --> 00:03:52.628]  We know Al-Qaeda is CIA-founded, run by the CIA.
[00:03:52.648 --> 00:03:53.390]  That's not debatable.
[00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.977]  So we know he quote, fell into CIA hands, so it really is an Al-Qaeda-affiliated group.
[00:03:58.198 --> 00:03:58.779]  It's the government.
[00:03:58.799 --> 00:03:59.360]  That's been proven.
[00:04:00.238 --> 00:04:24.022]  But then we have our government grabbing this guy, holding him, not letting him have a lawyer, not letting him call his family, roughing him up, doing all this stuff to him, and then he gets released after they had their little setup ready, and he magically, that day, gets grabbed by Al-Qaeda, which they admit basically has no presence in Iraq, because Saddam wouldn't let them in the last ten years, saying they were U.S.
[00:04:24.062 --> 00:04:25.683]  government agents trying to overthrow his country.
[00:04:26.043 --> 00:04:27.363]  That's just Saddam, though, you know.
[00:04:28.126 --> 00:04:32.548]  Who supposedly works with Al-Qaeda, publicly tracking down and killing Al-Qaeda, calling them government agents.
[00:04:32.828 --> 00:04:33.889]  The Saudis say that, too.
[00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:36.250]  The Saudi government says that they work for the U.S.
[00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.610]  government.
[00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:40.112]  It's public fact, I mean, you know.
[00:04:40.132 --> 00:04:44.814]  So, right in the middle of all this, right in the middle of all these torture photos coming out,
[00:04:45.484 --> 00:04:55.861]  Which the government asked CBS to hold off a few weeks on, so they could get this shot up and grab somebody to kill, then they could release him, and then bring these out and say, see, torture's good.
[00:04:56.202 --> 00:04:59.988]  I'm telling you folks, I know, I know in my guts, that's what happened.
[00:05:01.198 --> 00:05:04.920]  The grass is always greener with a wheatgrass kit from wheatgrasskits.com.

[00:05:35.896 --> 00:05:40.819]  The health benefits of wheatgrass are legendary, but perhaps one of the best benefits are the antioxidants.
[00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:44.542]  Research is showing that antioxidants are instrumental in preventing cancer.

[00:06:01.374 --> 00:06:09.282]  Skyrocketing oil prices, the economy on the brink, the plunging dollar, terrorism, the government spending $1.80 for every dollar it collects.
[00:06:09.603 --> 00:06:14.868]  Never in the history of our country have we faced so many threats to our freedoms, rights, and individual security.
[00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:17.651]  How long can we continue without a fracture occurring?
[00:06:17.791 --> 00:06:22.897]  With the events that recently rocked the elections in Spain, what will happen as we get closer to our own elections?
[00:06:23.417 --> 00:06:25.899]  Now is the time to begin preparing for such threats.
[00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:30.922]  Ready Reserve Foods has been helping businesses, government, and individuals for over 32 years.

[00:06:41.429 --> 00:06:45.632]  Just once I'd like to clean my car's leather upholstery without sliding across the seat on every turn.
[00:07:07.472 --> 00:07:11.894]  Just Once, I'd like to get a beautiful shine without a slick, oily resin that attracts dust and dirt.

[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:06.384]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.744 --> 00:08:09.046]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:30.642]  In Operation Northwoods, the declassified, public, admitted, we're talking ABC News, Baltimore Sun, Associated Press, and the admitted declassified report that we have on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com,
[00:08:31.733 --> 00:08:34.814]  They call for hijacking jets by remote control, crashing them.
[00:08:35.194 --> 00:08:36.014]  Our government does.
[00:08:37.215 --> 00:08:38.495]  Blaming it on foreign enemies.
[00:08:38.955 --> 00:08:39.975]  Bombing DC.
[00:08:40.075 --> 00:08:40.936]  Shooting people.
[00:08:41.936 --> 00:08:44.336]  Killing young people particularly, they say.
[00:08:44.496 --> 00:08:45.957]  It pulls on our heart strings.
[00:08:46.037 --> 00:08:48.758]  It causes a hopeful wave of indignation.
[00:08:50.158 --> 00:08:57.200]  And in the middle of this big torture scandal that the government asked CBS a month ago to hold off on for a few weeks,
[00:08:59.016 --> 00:08:59.997]  So they could get ready.
[00:09:00.337 --> 00:09:12.208]  In the middle of this, this poor person, Nick Berg, this entrepreneur, this brave individual, they've been in Kenya helping people set up infrastructure, been in Iraq, many other areas.
[00:09:12.228 --> 00:09:15.350]  He was trying to get out of the country, but the U.S.
[00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:22.517]  government over there grabbed him, held him for thirteen and a half days, released him, and the timeline's fuzzy.
[00:09:22.557 --> 00:09:24.919]  Be that that day or the next day, he's grabbed by
[00:09:25.922 --> 00:09:27.303]  Arab C.I.A.D.A.
[00:09:27.483 --> 00:09:29.124]  or Al C.I.A.D.A.
[00:09:30.865 --> 00:09:34.868]  and they cut his head off and I've seen the video.
[00:09:35.508 --> 00:09:36.429]  We have the video.
[00:09:36.449 --> 00:09:39.070]  Do you think we should post it on the websites?
[00:09:40.371 --> 00:09:41.532]  I really struggle with this.
[00:09:42.072 --> 00:09:43.413]  I think it should be seen, frankly.
[00:09:44.871 --> 00:09:48.452]  But I think the video, they're not releasing it.
[00:09:48.492 --> 00:09:52.132]  Senators are going to be given three hours to look at thousands of images and video.
[00:09:52.512 --> 00:09:56.393]  And they admit on the video it's our troops raping women and children, killing them, beating them to death.
[00:09:56.893 --> 00:09:57.973]  This is all admitted, by the way.
[00:09:58.013 --> 00:09:58.553]  This is public.
[00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:00.294]  Families pulled over at checkpoints.
[00:10:00.414 --> 00:10:01.254]  That should be seen.
[00:10:01.514 --> 00:10:12.436]  And the degenerate scum, the Allah Akbar-ing New World Order people that did this need to be brought to justice as well.
[00:10:12.556 --> 00:10:13.736]  It is disgusting.
[00:10:14.418 --> 00:10:16.320]  It is painful, very painful.
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.582]  This is all a massive psyops program.
[00:10:19.602 --> 00:10:20.903]  I'm totally sure of it now.
[00:10:21.344 --> 00:10:22.685]  Enough pieces have converged.
[00:10:22.745 --> 00:10:26.107]  I said in the last few days, look for a big terror attack or some event.
[00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:32.993]  I even said look for them to release some horrible video of, you know, Iraqis or somebody torturing our people to counter all of this.
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:42.764]  They're not releasing a video right now, they're showing little excerpts of it, because if they do show that, they'll have to show them beating the Iraqis to death.
[00:10:43.084 --> 00:10:49.348]  And it's wrong when our troops beat people to death, and rape them, and it's wrong when whoever did this does what they did.
[00:10:49.868 --> 00:10:51.109]  Equally disgusting.
[00:10:51.329 --> 00:10:53.530]  And the two don't cancel each other out.
[00:10:53.610 --> 00:11:04.637]  People are saying, I heard them all over talk radio last night, all over TV last night, all over radio this morning, oh, see, we gotta get tough, torture them, see, and the sicko callers are even worse than the socialist neocons.
[00:11:08.735 --> 00:11:09.516]  And his family.
[00:11:09.716 --> 00:11:13.899]  Now again, I got a call yesterday at about 4 o'clock.
[00:11:14.059 --> 00:11:26.710]  I was going into the TV studio and I got a call and I was driving and they said, have you seen the video of them cutting this guy's head off?
[00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:27.450]  Should we post it?
[00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:28.271]  And I said, I don't know.
[00:11:28.891 --> 00:11:33.075]  We've got the video and the site that had it up crashed because of all the visitors.
[00:11:33.095 --> 00:11:33.635]  Should we post it?
[00:11:33.655 --> 00:11:34.436]  And I said, I don't know.
[00:11:35.974 --> 00:11:40.495]  And just instantly, and you know, I go off facts and documents and integrated information.
[00:11:40.515 --> 00:11:43.035]  This is not a conspiracy theory broadcast.
[00:11:43.475 --> 00:11:48.016]  But occasionally when I get enough information, I will basically give you what I believe is going on.
[00:11:48.796 --> 00:11:51.897]  And I'm 98% sure this is a globalist operation.
[00:11:53.997 --> 00:12:00.439]  And I said, let me get back to the office and let me check out the info.
[00:12:00.839 --> 00:12:02.439]  And the first article I saw
[00:12:03.416 --> 00:12:09.318]  Was out of the Associated Press with the family saying our son wouldn't be dead if it wasn't for the U.S.
[00:12:09.398 --> 00:12:09.798]  government.
[00:12:10.819 --> 00:12:13.460]  Of course, he'll be called Democratic operatives within hours.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.401]  In fact, actually, I said that yesterday.
[00:12:15.421 --> 00:12:16.281]  Now they are doing it.
[00:12:18.102 --> 00:12:19.362]  Attacking them as Democratic operatives.
[00:12:19.382 --> 00:12:21.723]  You know, they'll even attack people who just lost their son.
[00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.571]  Because they don't agree with what happened.
[00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:26.011]  But why do they say this?
[00:12:26.131 --> 00:12:39.257]  Because he was grabbed for thirteen and a half days, and on the day he was released, or the morning of the day after, we're not sure, two different conflicting stories, he was captured by Al-CIADA.
[00:12:40.297 --> 00:12:42.898]  Al-Central Intelligence Agency ADA.
[00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:44.039]  Founded in 1979.
[00:12:46.889 --> 00:12:53.090]  And these fat guys, Al-Syedim, sit there and cut his head off as he squeals.
[00:12:53.911 --> 00:12:57.472]  It is just... And you hear him gargling as they cut through the windpipe.
[00:12:57.592 --> 00:12:59.812]  It is hell on earth.
[00:13:00.412 --> 00:13:11.515]  I've read the accounts of the French Inquisition, or not the Inquisition, the French Revolution, where they cut people's heads off, and many times they sit there looking and gasping, trying to talk.
[00:13:12.095 --> 00:13:16.316]  I mean, it is unbelievably horrific, and that's why all this violence
[00:13:17.023 --> 00:13:21.084]  In the movies and television desensitizes us and is so dangerous we need to be conscious of that.
[00:13:21.404 --> 00:13:26.345]  I'm not calling for censorship, I'm just saying we need to be conscious of the difference between simulated violence and real violence.
[00:13:27.665 --> 00:13:32.646]  I've struggled with the question of should we post this?
[00:13:32.806 --> 00:13:34.606]  We'll take your calls, what do you think on that issue?
[00:13:35.887 --> 00:13:37.407]  There's a lot of different factors here.
[00:13:38.627 --> 00:13:43.548]  He's over there, he's an independent contractor, working on communications towers,
[00:13:44.395 --> 00:13:50.261]  He's trying to exit the country, and right at the time, I mean days after, he was grabbed by the U.S.
[00:13:50.281 --> 00:13:59.491]  government, days after they admit that the Pentagon, Rumsfeld, personally called the head of CBS and said, wait a few weeks on airing that.
[00:14:00.432 --> 00:14:01.834]  Wait a few weeks on airing that.
[00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.412]  They've told the media don't air the other images and they've followed orders.
[00:14:05.672 --> 00:14:07.173]  Why didn't they just say don't show it?
[00:14:07.393 --> 00:14:08.994]  If they'd have said don't show it, they wouldn't have.
[00:14:09.154 --> 00:14:12.436]  There's been torture photos in the news for a year in Iraq.
[00:14:12.756 --> 00:14:14.597]  Two years in Afghanistan.
[00:14:15.177 --> 00:14:17.258]  That stuff never gets showed in our media.
[00:14:17.318 --> 00:14:19.219]  Why did they say hold off on it a few weeks?
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:24.983]  Then days later they grab, after they told CBS to hold up, they grab Byrd.
[00:14:25.083 --> 00:14:27.184]  Our government, admittedly, grabs him.
[00:14:27.324 --> 00:14:28.765]  A white guy, not even a Muslim.
[00:14:29.505 --> 00:14:30.706]  You know, they don't have any excuse.
[00:14:30.946 --> 00:14:33.647]  They can say, oh, we're grabbing all these Arabs because, you know, they can be terrorists.
[00:14:33.887 --> 00:14:50.234]  They grab this guy, he's got all his papers, they don't let him call a lawyer, don't let him call his family, keep him in there for half a day shy of two weeks, release him, and he is instantly, instantly grabbed by Al-Cieda.
[00:14:53.175 --> 00:14:54.636]  Or the Cieda Arabs.
[00:14:55.689 --> 00:14:58.011]  Arab C.I.A.T.I.S., whatever you want to call them.
[00:14:58.491 --> 00:15:07.619]  And they hold him, and then cut his head off, and then throw his body out on the road with his videotape.
[00:15:09.924 --> 00:15:15.785]  And then one of these Arab websites, known to be affiliated with the intelligence network of the government, comes out with this.
[00:15:16.525 --> 00:15:19.346]  Every time Colin Powell, people are saying, well Saddam isn't with Bin Laden.
[00:15:19.366 --> 00:15:21.046]  Suddenly, oh, Bin Laden's popped up on the new tape.
[00:15:21.226 --> 00:15:21.827]  He says he is.
[00:15:21.847 --> 00:15:25.287]  You know, whenever they need him, he's there, helping them.
[00:15:25.327 --> 00:15:28.628]  Like his family's done since 1918, serving British intelligence.
[00:15:29.108 --> 00:15:33.509]  Codename, a public codename of Bin Laden, Tim Osman, here in the U.S.
[00:15:34.689 --> 00:15:37.550]  The big hero of the 80s, fighting the Soviets.
[00:15:39.159 --> 00:15:41.341]  This is a total psyops.
[00:15:41.601 --> 00:15:43.182]  I, in my... I say 98%.
[00:15:44.083 --> 00:15:45.924]  I know for a fact.
[00:15:46.024 --> 00:15:49.787]  My guts, the information, the data, the timeline.
[00:15:50.088 --> 00:15:51.969]  I spent hours studying this last night.
[00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:54.831]  Hours this morning, deeply focusing in on this.
[00:15:55.412 --> 00:15:56.833]  And let me tell you, I am sure.
[00:15:56.953 --> 00:15:58.334]  And remember, I got on the air.
[00:15:58.414 --> 00:15:59.215]  I never do this.
[00:15:59.895 --> 00:16:00.576]  Very rarely.
[00:16:01.216 --> 00:16:04.439]  I got on the air July 25th and I said, call the White House, call Congress.
[00:16:04.699 --> 00:16:06.921]  They're gonna attack New York, probably the World Trade Center.
[00:16:06.941 --> 00:16:08.302]  They're gonna say Bin Laden did it.
[00:16:09.445 --> 00:16:12.307]  He's going to be their willing patsy on it.
[00:16:12.367 --> 00:16:13.587]  I've never done that.
[00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:16.548]  Now coming up on 10 years on air, I've done it once.
[00:16:16.669 --> 00:16:21.010]  And I'm here to tell you, everything lined up, as they say, the stars lined up on this.
[00:16:21.591 --> 00:16:24.792]  I know, I know they killed him.
[00:16:25.232 --> 00:16:26.033]  I know it!
[00:16:26.793 --> 00:16:28.214]  And you can put it in the bank.
[00:16:28.574 --> 00:16:29.494]  You can bet on it.
[00:16:29.694 --> 00:16:30.955]  You can guarantee it.
[00:16:31.847 --> 00:16:33.588]  Now, I just laid out all the evidence of this.
[00:16:33.648 --> 00:16:41.433]  If I was a police officer investigating a murder, and if cops looked at all the facts, they would go and they would investigate the government.
[00:16:41.453 --> 00:16:42.574]  Because who stands to gain?
[00:16:42.814 --> 00:16:50.399]  The timing, telling CBS, hold off a few weeks, he gets grabbed, he gets released, instantly goes into Al Qaeda's hands, who we know is CIA.
[00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:51.980]  I mean, that's the facts right there.
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.461]  That's 100% they're CIA right there.
[00:16:56.662 --> 00:16:57.303]  They grabbing,
[00:16:58.115 --> 00:17:03.319]  Do this and it's released right in the middle of the new release of some of the photos.
[00:17:04.179 --> 00:17:10.844]  And now we're all going to forget about the videos of raping women and beating people to death.
[00:17:13.926 --> 00:17:18.530]  And I, there were sickos running around the TV station last night actually saying, oh yeah, they deserve it.
[00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:19.690]  Yeah, see they cut the head off.
[00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:20.671]  Yeah, torture's good.
[00:17:21.071 --> 00:17:22.432]  And I said, raping women?
[00:17:22.492 --> 00:17:23.213]  Well, it's war.
[00:17:26.039 --> 00:17:27.141]  So they brought this out.
[00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:29.324]  It's part of a larger psychological program.
[00:17:29.424 --> 00:17:32.549]  All the TV shows, the dramas, promoting torture every episode.
[00:17:32.769 --> 00:17:33.270]  It's good.
[00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:34.412]  The good guys are doing it.
[00:17:35.073 --> 00:17:38.418]  Then in the print media, in the non-fiction media, saying it's good.
[00:17:38.718 --> 00:17:40.080]  Thousands of editorials.
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.162]  Literally thousands of articles.
[00:17:41.182 --> 00:17:41.803]  You've all seen them.
[00:17:42.649 --> 00:17:44.951]  All of this, and then suddenly this torture stuff comes out.
[00:17:45.091 --> 00:17:47.112]  Why, when they blocked all the other torture info?
[00:17:47.372 --> 00:17:51.895]  Lining up 3,000 people, machine gunning them in Afghanistan, shooting children, beating them to death.
[00:17:52.115 --> 00:17:53.436]  None of that comes out when they have it.
[00:17:53.476 --> 00:17:54.197]  The media has it.
[00:17:54.217 --> 00:17:54.957]  They haven't released it.
[00:17:55.137 --> 00:17:56.198]  It's been in the foreign press.
[00:17:56.879 --> 00:17:58.780]  None of that gets released, but this does.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.942]  CBS, military industrial complex owned.
[00:18:03.143 --> 00:18:05.263]  This is a massive psyops.
[00:18:05.704 --> 00:18:12.565]  And you watch Bush's approval rating is going to explode, people are going to accept torture, and this is part of the process.
[00:18:12.845 --> 00:18:24.928]  We know Al Qaeda is CIA, so right there we know it's the government doing it, but on top of it, our government holding this guy, releasing him directly into the hands of Al Qaeda.
[00:18:27.008 --> 00:18:31.389]  Who then holds off on the video, and dumping the body until right in the middle of this.
[00:18:33.165 --> 00:18:34.909]  Man, we're in a lot of trouble, people.
[00:18:35.971 --> 00:18:37.154]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[00:18:38.316 --> 00:18:43.068]  I just read mainstream articles where they put uranium in children's cereal in public schools.
[00:18:44.597 --> 00:18:45.538]  Gave it to pregnant women.
[00:18:45.838 --> 00:18:53.445]  So don't sit there and say they won't grab some poor young man who's out there trying to help the Iraqis who was even a Bush supporter.
[00:18:53.885 --> 00:18:56.888]  And they took him and they cut his head off!
[00:18:57.308 --> 00:19:03.434]  They got some of their Arab torture masters who cut a lot of heads off in Iran and a lot of heads off in Jordan.
[00:19:04.535 --> 00:19:08.999]  And they took him in there and they cut his head off to sell you on torture and evil.
[00:19:09.139 --> 00:19:11.421]  And this was all scripted and set up from the beginning.
[00:19:13.391 --> 00:19:14.692]  Guaranteed!
[00:19:14.892 --> 00:19:16.452]  You can bank on it!
[00:19:16.873 --> 00:19:17.973]  I know!
[00:19:18.833 --> 00:19:21.355]  My discernment is 100% on this!
[00:19:22.115 --> 00:19:26.917]  But I have enough evidence to prove who the prime suspects are, who stands to gain, and we know Al Qaeda's CIA.
[00:19:27.137 --> 00:19:28.137]  There's proof right there!
[00:19:28.418 --> 00:19:36.021]  Then you've got the government grabbing him, holding him, releasing him to Al Qaeda, not letting an American call his family or lawyers, not saying he done anything wrong!
[00:19:39.822 --> 00:19:40.903]  I hope you see through this.
[00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.251]  We'll come back and get into other news.
[00:19:43.511 --> 00:19:47.314]  A lot of chemtrail news in the Associated Press and Time Magazine of all places.
[00:19:47.614 --> 00:19:48.855]  Oh, there are more trails now.
[00:19:48.895 --> 00:19:49.916]  They do stay there now.
[00:19:50.316 --> 00:19:51.097]  Just accept it.
[00:19:51.817 --> 00:19:55.720]  They're going to have a national public school program teaching them to accept the chemtrails.
[00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:56.621]  I'm not kidding.
[00:19:56.861 --> 00:19:57.762]  That's coming up too.
[00:19:57.782 --> 00:19:58.242]  Stay with us.
[00:20:02.165 --> 00:20:10.794]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:20:11.014 --> 00:20:22.245]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:20:22.585 --> 00:20:22.965]  I think so.
[00:20:46.448 --> 00:20:50.374]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:20:50.395 --> 00:20:51.096]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:20:51.116 --> 00:20:51.817]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:02.119 --> 00:21:06.841]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[00:21:07.081 --> 00:21:10.502]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[00:21:10.722 --> 00:21:13.183]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[00:21:13.443 --> 00:21:22.046]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[00:21:22.386 --> 00:21:28.148]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[00:21:28.428 --> 00:21:30.389]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[00:21:30.649 --> 00:21:37.571]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.
[00:21:37.911 --> 00:21:44.373]  Midas Resources is pleased to offer a subscription to the International Forecaster newsletter free of charge with a qualifying order.
[00:21:44.634 --> 00:21:51.956]  That's right, for a limited time, Midas Resources is offering a one-year subscription to Bob Chapman's powerful newsletter, the International Forecaster.
[00:21:52.216 --> 00:21:56.679]  Call 800-686-2237 for more information or to place your order.
[00:21:56.779 --> 00:21:57.479]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:58.159 --> 00:22:01.581]  Call today and avoid getting soaked tomorrow.
[00:22:03.722 --> 00:22:06.444]  Hi, I'm Bobby Likus with today's Car Clinic Minute.
[00:22:06.784 --> 00:22:11.186]  As a kid, your green machine was the envy of every big wheeler on the block.
[00:22:11.527 --> 00:22:16.489]  But with today's gas prices, adult consumers are turning to a new green machine.
[00:22:16.749 --> 00:22:19.291]  When I return, we'll grow with the flow.
[00:22:20.587 --> 00:22:24.330]  In today's world of discord and disappointment, one thing's for sure.
[00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:29.353]  Car cover owners are so satisfied, they buy their car covers all over again.
[00:22:29.373 --> 00:22:31.154]  Think car covers are a hassle?
[00:22:31.414 --> 00:22:31.634]  No.
[00:22:31.954 --> 00:22:35.737]  Research shows owners find covers easy to put on and take off.
[00:22:36.137 --> 00:22:37.478]  Are all covers the same?
[00:22:37.738 --> 00:22:37.978]  No.
[00:22:38.238 --> 00:22:41.940]  The standard in car cover fabric is Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[00:22:42.321 --> 00:22:44.442]  Don't let sun and dust damage your car.
[00:22:44.742 --> 00:22:47.264]  Kimberly Clark's Block-It fabrics got you covered.
[00:22:47.524 --> 00:22:49.325]  That's Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[00:22:50.643 --> 00:22:54.668]  Yesteryear's green machines were inexpensive, non-polluting kids toys.
[00:22:55.128 --> 00:23:01.516]  But today's grown-up version, hybrid cars, are dubbed green for the color of money and the environment.
[00:23:01.776 --> 00:23:09.305]  Hybrids are designed with a gasoline engine and an electric motor that work in concert to increase efficiency and reduce emissions.
[00:23:09.725 --> 00:23:11.806]  Saving both money and the environment.
[00:23:12.047 --> 00:23:16.869]  No longer the ride of the future, Toyota and Honda hybrids are already on the road.
[00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:21.212]  And Ford, Dodge, GM and Lexus will soon grow with the flow.
[00:23:21.652 --> 00:23:27.756]  Yes, with a little insight into hybrids, you can escape gas lines and save the earth.
[00:23:28.236 --> 00:23:29.057]  I'm Bobby Likus.
[00:23:29.357 --> 00:23:30.838]  Likus, you'll love us!
[00:23:32.452 --> 00:23:36.495]  We've all seen the Tornado device on TV and wondered if it really worked.
[00:23:36.976 --> 00:23:46.183]  I was also skeptical at first until we tested six Tornado units and in every case we got more miles per gallon and felt more power.
[00:23:46.483 --> 00:23:51.887]  Gasoline is expensive so when we find something that saves us money it just makes sense to get it.
[00:23:52.147 --> 00:23:58.792]  Call 800-500-8880 and order your Tornado unit today or visit TornadoAir.com
[00:24:08.664 --> 00:24:16.530]  Alright, my friends.
[00:24:16.811 --> 00:24:18.192]  We're about to go to your calls.
[00:24:18.212 --> 00:24:19.713]  I'm going to take a lot of calls today.
[00:24:19.753 --> 00:24:21.854]  Your chance to respond to all the news.
[00:24:21.994 --> 00:24:24.456]  The gas prices.
[00:24:24.636 --> 00:24:27.719]  We have photos on the website of gas pumps at $3.50 a gallon.
[00:24:30.089 --> 00:24:34.131]  People getting 15 gallons and it costing, you know, $35, $40.
[00:24:37.412 --> 00:24:39.793]  The stock market gyrating wildly.
[00:24:39.893 --> 00:24:41.553]  NAFTA and GATT being expanded.
[00:24:41.613 --> 00:24:43.334]  Free Trade Area of the Americas.
[00:24:44.955 --> 00:24:48.456]  Bush quietly getting $25 billion more for the phony war.
[00:24:48.976 --> 00:24:52.118]  This poor man getting his head cut off by degenerates.
[00:24:54.679 --> 00:24:55.119]  All of it!
[00:24:55.279 --> 00:24:55.719]  But again,
[00:24:56.494 --> 00:24:57.154]  Young U.S.
[00:24:57.174 --> 00:24:59.035]  custody released right into L.C.I.A.
[00:24:59.135 --> 00:25:05.657]  in his hands, released right on time in the middle of this whole torture scandal to legitimize all of this.
[00:25:08.178 --> 00:25:09.258]  I say post it all.
[00:25:09.498 --> 00:25:11.119]  I say we should see it all.
[00:25:11.139 --> 00:25:18.901]  We should see him raping the women, beating people to death, and we should see these degenerates, these demons cutting this man's head off.
[00:25:19.501 --> 00:25:21.382]  These cold-blooded killers.
[00:25:22.462 --> 00:25:23.663]  Who stands to gain from this?
[00:25:23.723 --> 00:25:24.743]  Who is Al-Qaeda?
[00:25:25.515 --> 00:25:34.922]  Who had him in custody, who told CBS days before this poor man got grabbed, Mr. Berg got grabbed, Nick Berg got grabbed, who told CBS, hold off a few weeks on that.
[00:25:35.463 --> 00:25:38.965]  Then they release the photos, and they create the controversy, and they say, see, we told you so.
[00:25:39.926 --> 00:25:40.667]  This is how they do it.
[00:25:41.627 --> 00:25:45.250]  Maureen in Virginia, go ahead, you're on the air globally.
[00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:51.775]  Hi, I've got a feeling they had another thing in mind with beheading this poor man.
[00:25:51.815 --> 00:25:53.296]  You know Al Cuppett, don't you?
[00:25:53.897 --> 00:25:54.117]  Yes.
[00:25:54.702 --> 00:25:56.763]  I've heard him speak about this.
[00:25:57.403 --> 00:26:03.186]  A man named Ken Peters, I saw a video by him from the Prophecy Club talking about the guillotines.
[00:26:03.887 --> 00:26:10.890]  I do believe they are getting us ready psychologically for this, for basically large scale.
[00:26:11.331 --> 00:26:15.333]  And I would like to say... They cut our heads off, let's cut their heads off!
[00:26:15.873 --> 00:26:18.454]  I'm talking about... No, I know, I know, I know.
[00:26:18.474 --> 00:26:20.155]  Desensitization for everybody.
[00:26:20.475 --> 00:26:21.936]  But what I would suggest is,
[00:26:22.705 --> 00:26:26.108]  Everybody out there, the time is getting incredibly short.
[00:26:26.609 --> 00:26:32.874]  I would strongly suggest you get a hold of especially the 9-1-1 video by Alex.
[00:26:33.334 --> 00:26:41.942]  Take it to your mayor, take it to your chief of police, and if you can't see them, find somebody that knows them or see if you can get to their house.
[00:26:43.183 --> 00:26:44.644]  And give them the information.
[00:26:44.684 --> 00:26:45.605]  Great points, Maureen.
[00:26:45.665 --> 00:26:46.206]  Thank you.
[00:26:46.426 --> 00:26:47.607]  Maureen, have you seen the video?
[00:26:49.091 --> 00:26:53.356]  I have not only seen the video, I have made, oh gosh, I have, I am totally lost.
[00:26:54.537 --> 00:26:55.738]  I'm sorry, that's my fault.
[00:26:56.138 --> 00:27:00.203]  Not Road to Tyranny, the video of them cutting Mr. Berg's head off.
[00:27:00.283 --> 00:27:01.344]  No, no, no.
[00:27:01.744 --> 00:27:03.987]  I can't even, I just can't.
[00:27:04.007 --> 00:27:04.587]  We have it.
[00:27:05.028 --> 00:27:06.209]  Nobody else is posting it.
[00:27:06.229 --> 00:27:07.110]  Do you think we should post it?
[00:27:07.719 --> 00:27:12.920]  You know what, I don't, because I think that would be playing into their hands to further desensitize people.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.440]  Yeah, I think I agree with you.
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.461]  Okay, we'll take more calls on the subject.
[00:27:16.481 --> 00:27:16.741]  Thank you.
[00:27:16.761 --> 00:27:21.502]  But at the same time, then they won't show us the video of the troops raping and beating people to death.
[00:27:22.622 --> 00:27:25.743]  I mean, it certainly shouldn't be on until like after 11 somewhere, but I don't know.
[00:27:25.763 --> 00:27:26.703]  I just don't know.
[00:27:27.683 --> 00:27:28.943]  William in Oregon.
[00:27:28.983 --> 00:27:29.884]  William, you're on the air.
[00:27:29.944 --> 00:27:30.364]  Go ahead.
[00:27:30.904 --> 00:27:31.664]  Alex, good morning.
[00:27:31.684 --> 00:27:34.164]  Yeah, the video's atrocious.
[00:27:34.224 --> 00:27:35.745]  My heart goes out to the Byrd family.
[00:27:35.845 --> 00:27:36.865]  So you have seen the video?
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:42.344]  Yeah, it's disgusting, and it put a tear in my eye, and it's very painful.
[00:27:42.444 --> 00:27:44.105]  So you have seen it out there on sites?
[00:27:45.206 --> 00:27:47.128]  Yeah, I sent you an email last night.
[00:27:47.548 --> 00:27:48.389]  Well, we have the video.
[00:27:48.409 --> 00:27:49.430]  We've had it since yesterday.
[00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:50.470]  Well, it wasn't about that.
[00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:54.393]  It was about ICH got nailed by some hackers, and I guess Tom's backed up now.
[00:27:54.454 --> 00:27:58.417]  I don't know what happened on that, but I wanted to bring something up on this global... The Information Clearinghouse.
[00:27:58.657 --> 00:27:59.878]  Correct.
[00:28:00.538 --> 00:28:05.302]  You know, years ago, well, maybe not years, two years ago, I realized something I don't think a lot of people realize.
[00:28:05.362 --> 00:28:06.163]  I'm sure you do know.
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:18.510]  I found it very suspect about the Al Jazeera, and I always thought it would come out of Iran or somewhere, and I was shocked to see that it comes out of another puppet satellite called Qatar, as you're probably aware of.
[00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.952]  And that goes to show a strong linkage.
[00:28:21.012 --> 00:28:28.739]  I mean, do you think we let Al Jazeera, or they would allow, let's say, CBS or Fox to broadcast out of Iraq?
[00:28:28.919 --> 00:28:29.379]  Hell no!
[00:28:29.439 --> 00:28:34.464]  Well, I find it odd that Al Jazeera, who's very much of an instigating type of format, if you will,
[00:28:35.217 --> 00:28:36.918]  The Mideast is basically in a U.S.
[00:28:37.298 --> 00:28:44.482]  territory, if you will, because Qatar is right... Well, that's it, and let me add a caveat, or in addition to what you're saying, an addendum.
[00:28:47.183 --> 00:28:55.868]  I want to read over P2OG from the LA Times later, and from UPI two years ago, where Rumsfeld created a $7 billion a year group.
[00:28:56.248 --> 00:28:57.329]  That's $7 billion!
[00:28:58.061 --> 00:29:00.103]  To instigate, to carry out terror attacks.
[00:29:00.123 --> 00:29:00.724]  They admit this.
[00:29:00.764 --> 00:29:02.085]  To blow up and kill people.
[00:29:02.305 --> 00:29:03.506]  And to kill people's children.
[00:29:03.546 --> 00:29:04.668]  To get them to attack us.
[00:29:04.928 --> 00:29:07.710]  To create terrorists as a pretext to widen the war.
[00:29:07.771 --> 00:29:09.272]  So this is all a psy-ops.
[00:29:09.692 --> 00:29:10.773]  To hype up the Arabs.
[00:29:11.354 --> 00:29:12.996]  Then our people get killed and tortured.
[00:29:13.296 --> 00:29:14.857]  And then hype that up with us.
[00:29:15.198 --> 00:29:16.999]  This is all being manipulated.
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:17.800]  And understand.
[00:29:18.141 --> 00:29:19.382]  It just got released last year.
[00:29:19.402 --> 00:29:20.443]  It's in Masters of Terror.
[00:29:23.144 --> 00:29:31.527]  That Roosevelt made 7,000 civilians stay in the Philippines, wouldn't let them be evacuated, so they could be captured for propaganda reasons.
[00:29:31.567 --> 00:29:33.088]  That's the declassified document.
[00:29:34.529 --> 00:29:37.210]  And 4,000 of those 7,000 died in internment.
[00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:40.631]  They'll kill 4,000 people just for some propaganda on newsreels.
[00:29:40.711 --> 00:29:42.312]  Well, it's just like the Operation Northwoods.
[00:29:42.392 --> 00:29:43.232]  They tried to pull that out.
[00:29:43.252 --> 00:29:44.113]  You know, there's a pattern here.
[00:29:44.133 --> 00:29:46.454]  And people, you know, the average person's oblivious to it.
[00:29:46.574 --> 00:29:47.474]  They need to wake up to it.
[00:29:47.514 --> 00:29:47.994]  Thanks for the call.
[00:29:48.014 --> 00:29:48.395]  Great points.
[00:29:48.435 --> 00:29:49.095]  More calls coming up.
[00:29:51.787 --> 00:29:53.188]  This is GCN.
[00:29:53.348 --> 00:29:54.930]  What will you do without freedom?
[00:29:56.651 --> 00:29:59.754]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:30:02.096 --> 00:30:03.117]  It's finally here.
[00:30:03.257 --> 00:30:04.218]  Spring has arrived.
[00:30:04.418 --> 00:30:07.381]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:30:07.601 --> 00:30:11.044]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:30:11.264 --> 00:30:19.391]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[00:33:08.335 --> 00:33:08.655]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:08.695 --> 00:33:11.298]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight, we blast out
[00:33:29.614 --> 00:33:42.981]  Resisting Tyranny, Defending Liberty, the websites that have the still images of them cutting Mr. Nick Berg's poor head off are on PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:44.502]  Drudge also has them.
[00:33:44.582 --> 00:33:46.202]  We've had the video since yesterday.
[00:33:46.222 --> 00:33:51.165]  We briefly posted it and then I just watched it again and I said, I don't know, take it down.
[00:33:52.946 --> 00:33:54.066]  Some others have posted it.
[00:33:57.128 --> 00:34:01.131]  So when I talk to each caller, I also want to get your take on whether we should post this.
[00:34:01.471 --> 00:34:05.775]  You know, I think we should show the video of them raping and beating people to death at the prison.
[00:34:07.536 --> 00:34:11.759]  And frankly, I think we should show the video of them cutting this poor man's head off.
[00:34:11.919 --> 00:34:15.482]  But at the same time, I guess it's so abhorrent.
[00:34:17.844 --> 00:34:25.290]  And in a way, you could say it feeds into what the globalists are doing and hypes both sides up into this.
[00:34:26.391 --> 00:34:26.831]  I don't know.
[00:34:28.101 --> 00:34:31.364]  I'm rarely in a quandary, but I am here on this subject.
[00:34:32.084 --> 00:34:39.590]  I believe it's clear that Al-Qaeda, well we know Al-Qaeda CIA, we know that he was held by the U.S.
[00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:43.033]  government, wasn't allowed to call his family or a lawyer or the company he worked for.
[00:34:43.053 --> 00:34:50.118]  We know that he was grabbed and then released directly into Al-Qaeda hands, LCIA hands.
[00:34:51.119 --> 00:34:54.942]  And we know that this happened just days after he was grabbed by Al-Qaeda.
[00:34:55.732 --> 00:34:56.674]  Or were grabbed by the U.S.
[00:34:56.714 --> 00:35:05.608]  government, excuse me, just days after they told CBS to hold off a few weeks, then they released him right into Al Qaeda hands and they cut his head off.
[00:35:07.032 --> 00:35:30.016]  And then this legitimizes all the torture, and now we won't hear much about all the raping and killing that so many people are still in denial about by our troops under globalist control, which is all admitted by Rumsfeld and others, and senators get three hours to look at over a thousand digital images and hundreds of videotapes of the guards having sex together, the guards raping women, the guards raping children,
[00:35:30.776 --> 00:35:34.297]  Hellish stuff just as bad as cutting this poor person's head off.
[00:35:34.337 --> 00:35:35.438]  It's all horrible.
[00:35:35.678 --> 00:35:42.580]  And for the sickos out there, for the sicko Muslims that are on websites saying this is great, you're a bunch of demon possessed goblins.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:48.482]  And the same goes for the sickos on Neocon Radio saying torture them, kill them, it's all great.
[00:35:49.082 --> 00:35:51.643]  You're all being manipulated and you better stop it!
[00:35:54.051 --> 00:35:56.152]  I'll go over the evidence of why I'm totally sure.
[00:35:56.172 --> 00:36:06.194]  Well, I know Al-Qaeda is CIA, so that's the evidence right there, but all the other pieces of evidence showing why I'm 98%, well, I'm 100%, but I'll say, leave 2% for error.
[00:36:06.214 --> 00:36:10.715]  I mean, this is dead on that this is a PSYOP engaged in by the globalists.
[00:36:12.036 --> 00:36:15.377]  And if you don't think they'll do that, they do stuff like this all the time where they've been caught doing it.
[00:36:15.417 --> 00:36:16.617]  Stop being naive!
[00:36:18.799 --> 00:36:24.222]  Let's go to Jim Shepard here for a few minutes, then we'll go to Jules, Maggie, Carlos, and others.
[00:36:24.942 --> 00:36:26.803]  I want to get your response to all of this.
[00:36:26.823 --> 00:36:28.024]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:36:28.044 --> 00:36:34.207]  Jim Shepard, good to have you on with us today, sir.
[00:36:34.447 --> 00:36:35.307]  Always a pleasure.
[00:36:35.327 --> 00:36:46.373]  You know, I've been listening to you talk, and one of the publications that I read that I have found to be extremely accurate in prognosticating global geopolitical events
[00:36:46.963 --> 00:36:49.284]  This is Richard Marbury's U.S.
[00:36:49.344 --> 00:36:55.405]  World Early Warning Report, and he's the one who came up with the Kaos model.
[00:36:57.706 --> 00:37:01.907]  What he had to say in this last newsletter, Alex, goes right along with what you're saying.
[00:37:02.548 --> 00:37:08.129]  His hypothesis is that the Islamic world wants to expand this war.
[00:37:11.383 --> 00:37:13.625]  This little statement, I'm going to read a couple of sentences.
[00:37:13.685 --> 00:37:23.712]  The March bombings in Spain were spectacularly successful, changing the outcome of the Spanish elections and handing the Spanish government over to the Socialists.
[00:37:24.272 --> 00:37:26.054]  Another huge attack inside the U.S.
[00:37:26.174 --> 00:37:27.515]  might have similar results.
[00:37:28.215 --> 00:37:32.879]  Given their Spanish success, Washington's enemies must now be making a calculation.
[00:37:33.599 --> 00:37:38.483]  Are they satisfied with Bush, in other words, how his policies are expanding the war?
[00:37:39.088 --> 00:37:42.409]  Or do they think Kerry would help them spread the war faster?
[00:37:43.029 --> 00:37:51.811]  And it really appears that there are forces that are trying to fan the flame of this situation out in the Middle East.
[00:37:51.891 --> 00:37:53.371]  But we've got to go to the next level.
[00:37:53.411 --> 00:37:58.892]  This individual is looking at one mid-level slice above in the pyramidal power paradigm.
[00:37:59.332 --> 00:38:06.614]  Above that, you have this death-head group that Dr. Tania Karazhny, the chief economist in Russia for Vladimir Putin, talked about 9-11 months before.
[00:38:08.169 --> 00:38:09.369]  And publish it in major papers.
[00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:29.036]  She said, quote, the death's head, or the skull and bones group, in translation into English, the proper translation, this 300 trillion dollar group is bigger than our government, bigger than the Muslims, and is manipulating this towards a world crisis that will bring in the one world government that Albert Pike, the Chief Grand Mason, wrote about.
[00:38:29.576 --> 00:38:32.758]  It's in the Royal Naval Museum in England, his letter, what is it, in 1877,
[00:38:34.378 --> 00:38:44.025]  Calling for the third world war, laying out the three world wars, saying the third world war will be between the Christians, the Jews, and the Muslims, orchestrated by the Illuminati to bring in the Antichrist.
[00:38:44.625 --> 00:38:44.826]  Yeah.
[00:38:45.926 --> 00:38:51.750]  Well, I, you know, from what I have read, Alex, it just seems to me that you're way ahead of the curve on this.
[00:38:52.591 --> 00:38:58.315]  Well, I mean, just going off Albert Pike and the globalists and the rest of them, Jim, I appreciate your comments on that, my friend.
[00:38:58.815 --> 00:39:00.637]  People need to take action.
[00:39:00.657 --> 00:39:02.258]  We're in a very dangerous climate.
[00:39:02.839 --> 00:39:05.721]  That they've got every type of poison you can imagine in the water.
[00:39:06.122 --> 00:39:10.245]  Delaware River to dump 5 million gallons of nerve gas associated press into the water.
[00:39:10.265 --> 00:39:12.287]  I mean, this is the cuckoo insanity.
[00:39:12.547 --> 00:39:13.628]  Prozac, Ritalin.
[00:39:14.548 --> 00:39:19.930]  Birth control hormones, nickel, cadmium, mercury, all this stuff.
[00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:21.330]  Stop drinking the tap water.
[00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:22.410]  Stop being insane.
[00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:28.672]  Get the video Jim has about Sheltering in Place, produced by a former government top expert on nuclear, chemical, biological.
[00:39:29.092 --> 00:39:31.553]  Get the Prudent Places DVD, CD-ROM.
[00:39:32.013 --> 00:39:32.653]  Get it all.
[00:39:32.773 --> 00:39:34.374]  Get the specials on the Big Berkeys.
[00:39:34.774 --> 00:39:35.994]  Stop procrastinating.
[00:39:36.034 --> 00:39:37.735]  You need to get prepared.
[00:39:38.315 --> 00:39:40.056]  And just stop drinking the water, period.
[00:39:40.116 --> 00:39:41.296]  Jim, how do they take action?
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:50.582]  You can call up and get one of the videos or the CD-ROM book free with the purchase of the Berkey Light without the lights.
[00:39:50.622 --> 00:39:50.862]  That's $199.
[00:39:51.223 --> 00:39:57.864]  And you get the $30 video, Sheltering in Place, or the $30 CD book, Prudent Places.
[00:39:58.825 --> 00:40:03.506]  You can get them both if you get the Berkey Light with the lights, and that's $259.
[00:40:04.726 --> 00:40:08.687]  And you can also select what color you want, blue lights or red lights.
[00:40:08.927 --> 00:40:09.948]  Blue lights are beautiful.
[00:40:09.988 --> 00:40:11.268]  They'll make Mama real happy.
[00:40:11.926 --> 00:40:15.368]  And like they say, Alex, if mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.
[00:40:15.908 --> 00:40:16.688]  Well, I know that.
[00:40:18.529 --> 00:40:20.570]  And then the other one is the white light.
[00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:21.550]  That's more practical.
[00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:22.711]  That's emergency lighting.
[00:40:22.731 --> 00:40:27.713]  You can read with those lights and they'll run, you know, with the powers out and so on and so forth.
[00:40:27.753 --> 00:40:29.234]  So those are two great specials.
[00:40:29.674 --> 00:40:33.696]  If you already have one of the CD books, you can also pick a Berkey Sport.
[00:40:34.369 --> 00:40:41.414]  The $39 Berkey Sport Bottle, or you can pick the potassium iodate to prepare in case there is some sort of a crazy nuclear event.
[00:40:41.454 --> 00:40:44.757]  Now this is a, these are purifiers, not just filters.
[00:40:44.817 --> 00:40:47.579]  Filters, the cheap $50 filter just cuts the bad taste out.
[00:40:47.779 --> 00:40:50.081]  This makes your water safe for your family.
[00:40:50.161 --> 00:40:51.462]  Top universities have looked at it.
[00:40:51.762 --> 00:40:53.764]  Made in America sponsors this broadcast.
[00:40:54.084 --> 00:40:55.525]  They got a bunch of different specials.
[00:40:55.965 --> 00:41:00.948]  From $199 to $259, you name it, they got little sports bottles for 20-something bucks.
[00:41:00.988 --> 00:41:05.770]  Get a bunch of them for $100.
[00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:06.090]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:06.330]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:41:06.971 --> 00:41:17.796]  Or go to Berkeywater.com, write in the comment section that it's an Alex Jones special to save money and to specify what free gift you want.
[00:41:17.836 --> 00:41:21.418]  The video, the DVD, the sports bottle, the potassium iodate.
[00:41:22.018 --> 00:41:26.962]  Berkeywater.com, or you can order via our secure shopping cart at InfoWars.com as well, or 1-888-803-4438.
[00:41:27.083 --> 00:41:31.226]  Jim, thanks for coming on.
[00:41:31.346 --> 00:41:32.607]  Thanks for keeping up the good work.
[00:41:32.927 --> 00:41:33.388]  You too, Jim.
[00:41:33.428 --> 00:41:33.708]  Thank you.
[00:41:33.868 --> 00:41:35.029]  Alright, let's go straight to your calls.
[00:41:35.069 --> 00:41:35.930]  Thanks for staying with us.
[00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:38.652]  Let's talk to Jules in Oregon.
[00:41:38.812 --> 00:41:39.373]  Go ahead.
[00:41:39.393 --> 00:41:40.754]  Hello?
[00:41:41.054 --> 00:41:41.455]  Yes, sir.
[00:41:42.115 --> 00:41:44.637]  Excuse me?
[00:41:45.218 --> 00:41:46.739]  Yeah, your cell phone's cutting out or something.
[00:41:46.759 --> 00:41:47.600]  You're on the air, sir.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:50.022]  I'm in complete support of your mission.
[00:41:50.461 --> 00:41:53.522]  Tell you what, let's put him on hold, wait until he gets to a better cell zone.
[00:41:53.722 --> 00:41:55.303]  Pull over, sir, where you get a good cell.
[00:41:55.323 --> 00:41:56.563]  We'll go back to you in five minutes.
[00:41:57.003 --> 00:41:58.003]  Maggie in Texas.
[00:41:58.083 --> 00:41:58.964]  Maggie, you're on the air.
[00:41:59.024 --> 00:41:59.484]  Go ahead.
[00:41:59.504 --> 00:42:00.404]  Hi, Alex.
[00:42:01.124 --> 00:42:03.305]  Two things occur to me.
[00:42:03.525 --> 00:42:14.889]  One is I've just been absolutely astonished that as far as I can tell, nobody has made the connection either in print or on the electronic media about
[00:42:15.635 --> 00:42:21.396]  Between this beheading and a beheading by Pearl two years ago.
[00:42:22.356 --> 00:42:32.118]  Pearl had found out some info, was about to file a story about Al Qaeda and CIA and then he magically gets grabbed and gets his head cut off and CIA control Pakistan.
[00:42:32.458 --> 00:42:38.019]  On top of that, four reporters got video of the 3,000 people they took out of containers and machine gun.
[00:42:38.459 --> 00:42:43.680]  Then they, in coalition controlled territory, get machine gunned on the side of the road, execution style.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:44.780]  We can continue, go ahead.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:45.600]  Yeah, right.
[00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:48.261]  Nobody is talking about that at all.
[00:42:48.281 --> 00:42:57.244]  Well, they won't release, you know, I've seen that video, and they won't release that because if they release that, they've got to release the video of our troops raping and killing women.
[00:42:57.464 --> 00:43:03.805]  Yeah, well, I remember a couple of years ago it created a sensation because it was briefly on the internet.
[00:43:04.246 --> 00:43:05.386]  I did see it, and now
[00:43:06.007 --> 00:43:14.053]  Nobody is talking about that at all, and I can't help noticing the similarity of these two names, Pearl and Berg.
[00:43:14.073 --> 00:43:18.976]  Yeah, well, poor Jewish people.
[00:43:19.656 --> 00:43:25.140]  Do you think we should post, we've got the Pearl video, and we've got the other video of poor Mr. Berg.
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:26.301]  Should we post it?
[00:43:26.914 --> 00:43:28.415]  I'll tell you what I think.
[00:43:28.495 --> 00:43:47.112]  I was listening to your last caller and her point was well taken but I think you should post it briefly at least for a couple of days or at least post a reliable link to it because it'll be useful for your regular viewers and it may draw new viewers also to your website.
[00:43:48.951 --> 00:43:50.932]  I don't mean crazies necessarily.
[00:43:50.972 --> 00:43:52.973]  No, I mean I just don't want to post it just to get hits.
[00:43:53.053 --> 00:43:55.334]  Obviously if we post it, we'll get 20 million hits.
[00:43:55.494 --> 00:43:57.115]  No, I don't mean just hits.
[00:43:57.275 --> 00:43:59.676]  I mean people might then look around.
[00:44:00.216 --> 00:44:00.817]  I understand.
[00:44:00.837 --> 00:44:01.417]  I don't know.
[00:44:01.437 --> 00:44:01.917]  That's my idea.
[00:44:01.997 --> 00:44:03.918]  I'm going to decide by the end of this broadcast.
[00:44:04.098 --> 00:44:04.358]  Yeah.
[00:44:05.459 --> 00:44:06.439]  Have you seen the video?
[00:44:06.459 --> 00:44:08.460]  I have not seen this one.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.461]  I saw the Pearl video two years ago.
[00:44:10.481 --> 00:44:13.023]  Well, I mean nobody would want to watch this other than sickos.
[00:44:13.683 --> 00:44:14.343]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:44:14.743 --> 00:44:15.784]  You've got a dilemma there.
[00:44:17.424 --> 00:44:18.765]  Alright, well thank you for the call.
[00:44:18.805 --> 00:44:20.486]  Great points, Maggie.
[00:44:21.066 --> 00:44:23.968]  Now let's see if Jules in Oregon has gotten to a better cell area.
[00:44:24.008 --> 00:44:24.788]  Jules, go ahead.
[00:44:24.808 --> 00:44:26.569]  Hello, Alex.
[00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:27.190]  Yes, sir.
[00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:30.712]  I'm a supporter of your program.
[00:44:31.312 --> 00:44:33.453]  Let's do like this.
[00:44:33.734 --> 00:44:34.514]  I'm sorry, sir.
[00:44:34.554 --> 00:44:36.555]  You've got to get to a better... Go to a pay phone or something.
[00:44:36.575 --> 00:44:37.096]  You can call back.
[00:44:37.156 --> 00:44:37.556]  I'm sorry.
[00:44:38.166 --> 00:44:38.966]  Can't understand you.
[00:44:39.927 --> 00:44:42.228]  Sounds like you disagree with me, so I wish you'd call back.
[00:44:42.268 --> 00:44:43.268]  I got some of that.
[00:44:44.008 --> 00:44:46.189]  Let's talk to Carlos in California.
[00:44:46.229 --> 00:44:47.149]  Carlos, go ahead.
[00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:48.470]  Yes, Alex.
[00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:50.370]  You know, I couldn't agree with you more.
[00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:56.933]  I think the intelligence agencies are behind both atrocities on both sides.
[00:44:57.473 --> 00:44:59.894]  And they're manipulating that, of course, to create
[00:45:00.734 --> 00:45:07.920]  Higher and higher levels of atrocities, which will intensify the chaos, which is beneficial.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:22.471]  And that's what the new world globalists are looking for, to spread this war, this insane war against terrorism, all across the world, which will spread, of course, to Africa, South America, Central America, Europe, and then here.
[00:45:23.031 --> 00:45:26.714]  And when all this is said and done, they will have a pretext
[00:45:27.281 --> 00:45:30.022]  Who created a new world order to restore order?
[00:45:30.202 --> 00:45:30.922]  That's what it's all about!
[00:45:47.168 --> 00:45:47.869]  It's just too horrifying.
[00:45:47.889 --> 00:45:49.450]  No, I don't think so, Alex.
[00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:50.570]  I saw the video yesterday.
[00:46:11.482 --> 00:46:12.182]  It's too horrifying.
[00:46:12.242 --> 00:46:14.044]  It's just going to anger more people.
[00:46:14.384 --> 00:46:15.965]  And it's going to create more chaos.
[00:46:16.205 --> 00:46:18.526]  I think that should be left out.
[00:46:18.566 --> 00:46:23.089]  But by the same token, we shouldn't show the guards raping and beating women and children to death?
[00:46:23.809 --> 00:46:31.634]  Well, you know, death is not as morbid as the beheading of this gentleman.
[00:46:31.794 --> 00:46:32.194]  I don't know.
[00:46:32.214 --> 00:46:33.095]  We haven't seen it.
[00:46:33.255 --> 00:46:35.636]  Only the Senators are allowed to see it for three hours today.
[00:46:36.076 --> 00:46:36.717]  Well, it's true.
[00:46:36.737 --> 00:46:38.077]  I haven't seen the full video.
[00:46:38.638 --> 00:46:39.899]  I don't condone any of it.
[00:46:41.144 --> 00:46:44.085]  You know, you are absolutely right about this.
[00:46:44.245 --> 00:46:49.008]  Albert Pike did plan three world wars to lead us into world government.
[00:46:49.268 --> 00:46:58.632]  Founder of the Ku Klux Klan, Supreme Grand Mason, Confederate General, British agent, publicly writing a letter, writing in his book that he's possessed by Lucifer.
[00:46:58.852 --> 00:47:09.857]  There will be World War I between Europe, then a world government body created, a World War II with Europe again, then a war with the Arabs for one world government.
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:21.564]  Exactly, you know what people don't know is that the Knights of the Golden Circle, which was a pre-Masonic faction, created the Civil War, or stirred up the Civil War.
[00:47:21.584 --> 00:47:22.804]  Yeah, started it on both sides.
[00:47:23.285 --> 00:47:27.906]  Exactly, and then... This is what they do, this is how they operate.
[00:47:27.926 --> 00:47:36.769]  Yes, they went on to merge them with the Ku Klux Klan, and you're absolutely right, Albert Pike was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:47:37.029 --> 00:47:38.330]  This is all in the encyclopedia.
[00:47:39.295 --> 00:47:39.815]  Exactly.
[00:47:40.435 --> 00:47:43.196]  And people should become aware of who our leaders are.
[00:47:43.236 --> 00:47:51.979]  You know, George Bush has financial connections with the Bin Laden, with the Saudi Royal Family.
[00:47:52.079 --> 00:47:53.039]  And this is all admitted!
[00:47:53.059 --> 00:47:56.080]  This is all admitted in public, and still people deny it.
[00:47:56.753 --> 00:47:57.153]  Exactly.
[00:47:57.173 --> 00:47:59.315]  He vacations with the Bin Ladens.
[00:47:59.575 --> 00:48:02.156]  They flew the Bin Ladens out after 9-11.
[00:48:02.396 --> 00:48:03.137]  George Bush Sr.
[00:48:03.157 --> 00:48:05.958]  was having breakfast at 8.30 in the morning at the Ritz-Carlton, D.C.
[00:48:06.499 --> 00:48:08.120]  with the head of the Bin Laden family.
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:13.583]  The head of Pakistani intelligence, who wired $100,000 to the supposed lead hijacker, Mohammad Atta.
[00:48:13.803 --> 00:48:17.545]  The general was meeting with the heads of the House and Senate Intelligence Committee for breakfast that morning.
[00:48:17.745 --> 00:48:19.046]  This whole thing is staged.
[00:48:19.086 --> 00:48:22.268]  They admit that Al-Qaeda was founded by the CIA.
[00:48:22.488 --> 00:48:26.310]  The Senate report admits that in 1998 they were used, Al-Qaeda, with Bin Laden in
[00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:29.492]  Hello Alex, I see that you're already talking about this, and that's good.
[00:48:29.512 --> 00:48:31.453]  I just wanted to point out that there's no proof that
[00:48:49.569 --> 00:48:52.612]  Those people we saw in that video were Al-Qaeda.
[00:48:52.692 --> 00:48:53.833]  They're fat guys.
[00:48:54.313 --> 00:49:04.442]  We know that Mr. Chalibi is an admitted former head torture master for the Shah of Iran, a convicted bank robber.
[00:49:04.502 --> 00:49:05.323]  I'm not saying he did it.
[00:49:05.343 --> 00:49:12.709]  I'm just saying these are the kind of individuals that are on the payroll running things, and it's very easy to have a squad of Arabs
[00:49:13.569 --> 00:49:15.050]  Uh, that are under CIA control.
[00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:15.971]  Look, they admit!
[00:49:16.031 --> 00:49:17.091]  The family says the U.S.
[00:49:17.131 --> 00:49:19.933]  government... Look, I read the transcript of what they said.
[00:49:19.953 --> 00:49:24.075]  They said, they said, it's your fault, you're involved, you had him, what'd you do?
[00:49:24.295 --> 00:49:25.196]  And the media spends it.
[00:49:25.256 --> 00:49:30.299]  Oh, they're angry, because they said they were holding him, and then the next day he was accidentally got grabbed by Al-Qaeda.
[00:49:30.599 --> 00:49:33.260]  How obvious does this have to get for people?
[00:49:33.541 --> 00:49:40.545]  Well, and also consider that, uh, the man is supposedly identifying himself in this, uh, statement of his, but he's got his head covered.
[00:49:40.565 --> 00:49:41.265]  And why is that?
[00:49:41.932 --> 00:49:44.773]  Well, I heard them going, how come these criminals are wearing masks?
[00:49:44.833 --> 00:49:45.654]  Criminals wear masks.
[00:49:45.934 --> 00:49:47.335]  Well, why do our police wear masks?
[00:49:47.435 --> 00:49:48.015]  I agree.
[00:49:48.595 --> 00:49:51.236]  Bad guys that got something to hide cover their faces.
[00:49:51.436 --> 00:49:55.658]  You know my name, Alexander Emmerich Jones, from Austin, Texas.
[00:49:55.738 --> 00:49:56.679]  I don't hide who I am.
[00:49:56.879 --> 00:49:58.980]  Why does the government sneak around and hide so much?
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:02.682]  Well, if things crawl under rocks, you know that.
[00:50:06.032 --> 00:50:10.454]  I've been listening to you talk about this, and you're absolutely on, and that's why I was calling in.
[00:50:10.514 --> 00:50:17.977]  It's diverted network coverage from the prison situation, and it justifies the mistreatment of prisoners, supposedly.
[00:50:19.178 --> 00:50:25.700]  It justifies our action in Iraq, so there's a lot of things here that this did to benefit our action.
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:27.561]  And look at the timeline, my friend.
[00:50:28.722 --> 00:50:31.283]  Days after they tell CBS to not show the photos,
[00:50:32.763 --> 00:50:33.925]  That all adds up.
[00:50:33.985 --> 00:50:41.912]  Berg gets grabbed by the Coalition, then he gets released, then he gets killed, then he gets released now, during the Senate seeing these other videos.
[00:50:42.153 --> 00:50:44.595]  Call Michael Berg and ask for his permission.
[00:50:44.635 --> 00:50:46.857]  Talk to him personally before you post this.
[00:50:47.058 --> 00:50:52.002]  I think he will give you permission once he talks to you and sees where you're coming from, Alex.
[00:50:52.022 --> 00:50:53.724]  Well, other people are posting it, yeah.
[00:50:54.185 --> 00:50:55.846]  But even if he said post it, I don't know.
[00:50:55.866 --> 00:50:56.467]  I just...
[00:50:57.105 --> 00:50:58.685]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:58.725 --> 00:51:00.046]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:51:01.466 --> 00:51:08.308]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.608 --> 00:51:10.008]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.188 --> 00:51:12.389]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.529 --> 00:51:14.630]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:19.851]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.171 --> 00:51:24.192]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.472 --> 00:51:26.233]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.313 --> 00:51:36.955]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plumbable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.095 --> 00:51:38.996]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:51:39.216 --> 00:51:43.077]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the info war.
[00:51:43.177 --> 00:51:44.597]  Order right now by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:44.637 --> 00:51:44.817]  That's 888-253-3139.

[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:06.863]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:52:07.023 --> 00:52:13.185]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:52:13.465 --> 00:52:21.909]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:52:22.149 --> 00:52:29.152]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:52:29.472 --> 00:52:34.295]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:52:34.515 --> 00:52:39.919]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:52:40.259 --> 00:52:43.321]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or night light.
[00:52:43.662 --> 00:52:51.667]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:51.687 --> 00:52:52.247]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:52:59.292 --> 00:53:01.935]  I think so.
[00:53:17.052 --> 00:53:17.632]  I think so.
[00:53:37.244 --> 00:53:37.464]  I think so.
[00:54:08.363 --> 00:54:10.704]  More of your calls coming up in the next hour.
[00:54:10.724 --> 00:54:14.526]  As soon as we start the next hour, I'll get into more of the news, more of the details.
[00:54:14.726 --> 00:54:20.409]  Bottom line, this poor Nick Berg, independent contractor, is over there in Iraq.
[00:54:21.252 --> 00:54:22.554]  He tries to leave the country.
[00:54:22.694 --> 00:54:24.336]  He's detained by coalition forces.
[00:54:24.376 --> 00:54:25.597]  And remember, he's a white guy.
[00:54:26.058 --> 00:54:27.059]  They can say, oh, you're an Arab.
[00:54:27.119 --> 00:54:29.081]  We've got to keep you, which would be bad enough.
[00:54:29.121 --> 00:54:30.843]  But it's just a white guy admittedly there.
[00:54:31.844 --> 00:54:32.765]  No criminal record.
[00:54:33.246 --> 00:54:34.407]  They keep him for two weeks.
[00:54:34.507 --> 00:54:39.513]  Right around the time they're telling CBS not to release the photos, they said, hold off on that while we get stuff set up.
[00:54:41.756 --> 00:54:45.599]  He gets grabbed for 13 and a half days, released within less than 24 hours.
[00:54:45.639 --> 00:54:48.500]  He's an LCIA in his hands and is killed.
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:50.762]  We know Al-Qaeda isn't mentally CIA.
[00:54:50.782 --> 00:54:51.983]  That's public knowledge, folks.
[00:54:52.263 --> 00:54:53.263]  You can deny that if you want.
[00:54:53.644 --> 00:54:56.265]  Made two films, written a book, published a book on the subject.
[00:54:56.405 --> 00:54:58.507]  Carry a bunch of other videos and books on the subject on the website.
[00:55:00.048 --> 00:55:01.068]  So this is very important.
[00:55:01.489 --> 00:55:06.292]  And then now this comes out and blacks out all the news of the raping and killing and stuff that just cannot be ignored.
[00:55:08.050 --> 00:55:23.696]  Now, a talk show host on the network who's based up at the main office, Studio A, you could say, in Minnesota, Tom Andrew, who is the host of The Roundtable, weekdays here on the network, did some research, and this adds to what we're seeing.
[00:55:24.946 --> 00:55:34.830]  The March 13th MSNBC reported, and it's always this way, always the new terrorist who supposedly bombs or kills or does something, dies before they go out to another crime.
[00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:40.632]  Or they catch multiple terrorists three or four times, kill them three or four times, just keep using the same names over and over again.
[00:55:40.832 --> 00:55:45.854]  The supposed guy with the knife cutting the head off, they say died in Northern Iraq months ago.
[00:55:46.595 --> 00:55:56.555]  And, uh, Tom Andrew, give us the date, headline, and I know you're going to email me the story, we're going to post it on InfoWars and PresentPlanet in the next few minutes, but, uh, please tell us about the article, sir.
[00:55:57.786 --> 00:55:59.247]  Well, I assume you can hear me?
[00:55:59.567 --> 00:55:59.947]  Yes, sir.
[00:56:00.227 --> 00:56:14.292]  Okay, well, the name Zarqawi, Abu Musab Zarqawi, just rang a bell to me, and of course a lot of names are similar, but actually whatreallyhappened.com has it on their site that, didn't we kill this guy three months ago?
[00:56:14.552 --> 00:56:21.854]  The article just says, a Jordanian extremist suspected of bloody suicide attacks in Iraq was killed some time ago in a U.S.
[00:56:21.874 --> 00:56:26.216]  bombing, and a letter outlining plans for fomenting sectarian wars of forgery
[00:56:26.656 --> 00:56:35.659]  Goes on to say Abu Musab al-Zarqari was killed in the Sulaymaniyah mountains of northern Iraq during the American bombing there.
[00:56:35.819 --> 00:56:38.601]  And that's MSNBC, March 13th?
[00:56:38.901 --> 00:56:40.741]  Yeah, March 4th, I believe.
[00:56:40.761 --> 00:56:41.622]  March 4th, excuse me.
[00:56:41.862 --> 00:56:47.624]  We'll get that posted on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com immediately for folks.
[00:56:48.824 --> 00:56:50.585]  Have you been listening to my analysis of this?
[00:56:50.845 --> 00:56:51.225]  Oh, sure.
[00:56:51.566 --> 00:56:52.186]  What do you think of it?
[00:56:52.526 --> 00:56:53.327]  Very timely.
[00:56:53.867 --> 00:57:05.996]  I mean, your analysis is right on, but it's just the obfuscation and this couldn't have come at a better strategic moment for... And we know Al-Qaeda CIA, we know Coalition had him in custody, releases him right into Al-Qaeda hands.
[00:57:07.317 --> 00:57:10.199]  They told CBS to hold off while they were holding him, then they release him.
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:11.961]  This thing is so staged.
[00:57:13.302 --> 00:57:16.704]  Well, his parents are aware of this, that he was in U.S.
[00:57:16.744 --> 00:57:17.865]  custody, so hopefully
[00:57:19.611 --> 00:57:21.652]  Hopefully they make some noise about it.
[00:57:22.292 --> 00:57:23.433]  Anything else you want to add?
[00:57:23.833 --> 00:57:24.553]  That's about it, man.
[00:57:24.693 --> 00:57:26.954]  Tell them what time your broadcast is on.
[00:57:27.274 --> 00:57:29.195]  I'm at 3 o'clock Central Standard Time.
[00:57:29.415 --> 00:57:30.436]  Alright, right here on the network.
[00:57:30.456 --> 00:57:31.056]  Take care, my friend.
[00:57:31.076 --> 00:57:31.436]  Thanks, buddy.
[00:57:31.716 --> 00:57:33.997]  Okay, we'll be back with the second hour.

[00:58:30.678 --> 00:58:31.739]  Big part of the solution.

[00:59:01.809 --> 00:59:04.251]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:59:04.671 --> 00:59:19.215]  The video, Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:59:19.255 --> 00:59:19.575]  government.

[01:00:03.528 --> 01:00:04.329]  You want answers?
[01:00:05.089 --> 01:00:06.030]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:07.031 --> 01:00:10.314]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.834 --> 01:00:14.977]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.158 --> 01:00:25.606]  Alright, my friends, now into our number two.
[01:00:27.765 --> 01:00:34.792]  I'm going to do a brief recap of some of our top stories, then we'll break and come straight back to all of you that are patiently holding.
[01:00:34.812 --> 01:00:37.495]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:41.787 --> 01:00:59.532]  Horrible, grisly images of this poor young man, the killing of Nick Berg, the American telephone engineer, beheaded by Islamic militants in Iraq, triggered a political storm last night as the murdered man's father blamed the Bush administration for the circumstances that led to his death.
[01:01:00.552 --> 01:01:02.633]  He was held for thirteen and a half days.
[01:01:02.673 --> 01:01:04.213]  He was trying to exit the country.
[01:01:04.874 --> 01:01:09.555]  Right around the time, just a few days after they told CBS not to air the torture photos,
[01:01:11.090 --> 01:01:15.013]  of coalition forces in the prison in Baghdad, at the airport.
[01:01:16.474 --> 01:01:36.668]  Right before they did that, and then just a few days after they grabbed Mr. Berg, and they hold him for 13 days, they release him, and within less than 24 hours, he is in Al-Ci Ada's, that's Central Intelligence Ada's hands,
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:48.506]  And these chubby guys, that look like your normal Arab fighters, cut his poor head off while he screams and begs and then gargles on his own blood.
[01:01:48.586 --> 01:01:53.729]  I have watched the video, we have it, we have not posting it, we're discussing that right now.
[01:01:54.109 --> 01:02:00.533]  We have some of the still images of this happening that others have posted, like Drudge, on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:02:01.013 --> 01:02:02.094]  So perfect timing!
[01:02:02.974 --> 01:02:06.256]  They know this is coming out, they grab him a patsy,
[01:02:07.156 --> 01:02:15.060]  They release him, he goes right into Al-Qaeda, L-C-I-A-D-A, C-I-A admittedly controls Al-Qaeda, that's public knowledge, publicly documented.
[01:02:15.721 --> 01:02:21.224]  And then they hold off on this and the dead body in the video gets released right as it's coming out.
[01:02:21.264 --> 01:02:26.087]  But it isn't just beating men or beating men to death, it's raping women and children, killing them.
[01:02:26.927 --> 01:02:29.989]  It's not just police dogs biting people or all the other horrible stuff.
[01:02:30.329 --> 01:02:33.731]  It's admitted that all this is, other nightmares are going on.
[01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:46.566]  And then this legitimize all of it, part of the larger program of conditioning the public to accept torture that we see in the dramas and cop shows on TV and then in the print media and non-fiction telling us how good torture is.
[01:02:47.682 --> 01:02:50.923]  This is classical psychological warfare operations.
[01:02:51.083 --> 01:02:55.785]  I am sure, conclusively from the evidence, that the globalists are behind this.
[01:02:55.825 --> 01:03:07.570]  And again, I just read mainstream news yesterday where they put uranium in children's cornflakes at public schools, gave women uranium and plutonium tablets when they were pregnant just to see what it'd do to them.
[01:03:08.170 --> 01:03:16.253]  Operation Northwoods calls for killing Americans, preferably young people, to blame it on foreign enemies because killing young people makes the public so angry.
[01:03:17.399 --> 01:03:18.700]  Goes after our instincts.
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:20.401]  I mean, this is the history.
[01:03:20.441 --> 01:03:21.522]  And then you have the M.O.
[01:03:21.602 --> 01:03:22.662]  And then you have the evidence.
[01:03:22.983 --> 01:03:25.264]  And the family is out there saying, look, you had him.
[01:03:25.424 --> 01:03:26.925]  And then he goes right into Al Qaeda's hands.
[01:03:27.125 --> 01:03:27.926]  How did that happen?
[01:03:28.086 --> 01:03:29.466]  And yeah, we're saying, how did that happen?
[01:03:29.607 --> 01:03:30.687]  But it's not just that evidence.
[01:03:30.727 --> 01:03:33.389]  We know Al Qaeda is CIA.
[01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:36.871]  So, this is what we're discussing.
[01:03:36.971 --> 01:03:38.392]  And it's all vitally important.
[01:03:39.677 --> 01:03:46.701]  We're going to go to Charles, and Sean, and Kevin, and Dan, and of course Jules, and others.
[01:03:47.361 --> 01:03:51.764]  After we get back from this quick break, we'll go to Jules first, because he had a cell phone earlier and it cut out.
[01:03:53.185 --> 01:03:56.086]  And then Time Magazine, of all places, is talking about chemtrails.
[01:03:56.106 --> 01:04:07.513]  There was a mainstream article yesterday out of the Associated Press about, oh yeah, the chemtrails are real, the skies are 20% darker, but it's no big deal, and you're a conspiracy theorist if you don't love it, and NASA admits it's going on, but won't really say why.
[01:04:09.198 --> 01:04:31.871]  We'll get into that, a bunch of news on the gas prices, and what this psyops to condition us, to alarm us, to upset us, what this is distracting us from, NAFTA being reauthorized, free trade area of the Americas coming in, all the loss of liberty in America, the 25 billion dollars being rushed through to supplement the expanding war.
[01:04:32.792 --> 01:04:37.835]  All of this, we'll discuss it in the next hour and 55 minutes that we've got left,
[01:04:38.462 --> 01:04:40.284]  In this global transmission against tyranny.
[01:04:41.205 --> 01:04:44.028]  Again, the website's PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:04:44.649 --> 01:04:51.737]  You want to see the still images, and discretion is advised, of this poor man having his head severed while he's wide awake.
[01:04:51.777 --> 01:04:52.398]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:55.171 --> 01:04:59.673]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:05:00.034 --> 01:05:04.116]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:05:04.416 --> 01:05:04.956]  We listened.
[01:05:05.256 --> 01:05:10.239]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:05:10.519 --> 01:05:11.000]  We listened.
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:14.421]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:05:14.862 --> 01:05:15.402]  We listened.
[01:05:15.862 --> 01:05:19.024]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[01:05:19.244 --> 01:05:19.564]  I don't know.
[01:05:45.766 --> 01:05:49.410]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[01:05:50.231 --> 01:05:52.894]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:55.276 --> 01:05:59.581]  Just once I'd like to clean my car's leather or upholstery without sliding across the seat on every turn.

[01:06:58.776 --> 01:06:59.517]  You heard that right.
[01:06:59.717 --> 01:07:02.480]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:03.941]  You don't have to pay them off.
[01:07:04.181 --> 01:07:05.562]  The banks are defrauding you.
[01:07:05.842 --> 01:07:07.184]  Now is the time to fight back.
[01:07:07.424 --> 01:07:10.006]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.

[01:07:59.984 --> 01:08:01.045]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:01.766 --> 01:08:02.847]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:03.527 --> 01:08:04.268]  You want answers?
[01:08:05.083 --> 01:08:05.964]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:05.984 --> 01:08:10.228]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.828 --> 01:08:14.932]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:18.155 --> 01:08:22.399]  Let me just briefly recap in about 60 seconds, then we'll go straight to your calls.
[01:08:22.459 --> 01:08:25.762]  I want to take your calls quickly, so have your question, your comment ready.
[01:08:26.943 --> 01:08:30.847]  I'm asking you, we have the video, that you want it posted.
[01:08:31.556 --> 01:08:36.897]  Do you want the video of this man having his head sawed off while he's alive posted?
[01:08:37.317 --> 01:08:38.477]  Do you think we should post it?
[01:08:38.517 --> 01:08:39.918]  Does it add to the hysteria?
[01:08:40.778 --> 01:08:41.958]  Does it help the globalists?
[01:08:42.018 --> 01:08:46.679]  Does it help the CIA to control the Arabs?
[01:08:47.519 --> 01:08:48.299]  What do you think?
[01:08:48.319 --> 01:08:50.980]  I'm going to make my decision in the next 30 minutes.
[01:08:51.580 --> 01:09:00.722]  Again, I think we should see the photos of the guards raping and killing people, raping children.
[01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:02.641]  I mean, we have to see this.
[01:09:02.741 --> 01:09:03.562]  We have to know.
[01:09:06.243 --> 01:09:11.147]  You know, we see piles of dead Jews being pushed into mass graves by the Nazis.
[01:09:11.907 --> 01:09:14.489]  We see Nazis blowing their poor heads off.
[01:09:15.450 --> 01:09:18.472]  Because of that, you know, that's all over PBS Discovery Channel.
[01:09:18.492 --> 01:09:20.273]  We've all seen it 10,000 times, literally.
[01:09:21.093 --> 01:09:22.474]  That's why I'm leaning towards doing it.
[01:09:25.176 --> 01:09:26.597]  I'm really in a quandary here.
[01:09:28.058 --> 01:09:30.540]  But, again, for those who just joined us, here's the recap.
[01:09:31.525 --> 01:09:37.008]  Nick Berg was trying to leave the country and was grabbed by U.S.
[01:09:37.048 --> 01:09:37.969]  coalition forces.
[01:09:38.029 --> 01:09:40.210]  Hell, he was not allowed to talk to family or anyone.
[01:09:42.051 --> 01:09:43.452]  Was not allowed to talk to anyone.
[01:09:43.492 --> 01:09:46.413]  Was not allowed to leave or make phone calls.
[01:09:46.513 --> 01:09:50.916]  He then gets released and within less than 24 hours he is in Al-Qaeda hands.
[01:09:51.036 --> 01:09:53.657]  Al-Qaeda was admittedly founded by the CIA.
[01:09:54.738 --> 01:09:59.260]  The CIA admittedly used them to attack Serbia as the pretext to then go after Serbia.
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:00.941]  That's the Senate's own report.
[01:10:02.225 --> 01:10:03.946]  Republicans own report from 99.
[01:10:04.847 --> 01:10:07.148]  We know they use them to create these crises.
[01:10:08.649 --> 01:10:16.455]  We know this now blacks out the firestorm over the torture and the rape and the murder, which is just as bad as this horrible event.
[01:10:17.896 --> 01:10:24.220]  We know that the people running Iraq, the Arabs running Iraq, ran things for the Shah, running torture operations.
[01:10:27.483 --> 01:10:32.306]  This is very easy to stage, and they blurred the video on purpose, which makes it very suspicious.
[01:10:32.446 --> 01:10:38.829]  It has the same look as the video of the fat bin Laden that they later had to admit was fake.
[01:10:38.889 --> 01:10:43.652]  The fake bin Laden taking credit for 9-11 with the giant nose who suddenly gained 80 pounds.
[01:10:45.693 --> 01:10:47.154]  So, very, very suspicious.
[01:10:47.214 --> 01:10:48.815]  Look at who stands to gain on this.
[01:10:50.256 --> 01:10:53.878]  I see no other direction than to say the globalists are behind this.
[01:10:54.728 --> 01:10:56.770]  Let's go to Jules in Oregon.
[01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:57.551]  Jules, go ahead.
[01:10:57.571 --> 01:10:58.992]  How you doing, Mr. Jones?
[01:10:59.112 --> 01:10:59.412]  Fine.
[01:11:00.493 --> 01:11:10.481]  When the Prince of Darkness, McVeigh, bombed Oklahoma City, we didn't go around and vilify, nor should we have vilified the Protestants, which he claimed to be a part of.
[01:11:10.941 --> 01:11:13.063]  Oh, so you really think McVeigh bombed that building alone?
[01:11:13.083 --> 01:11:13.784]  No, no, no, no.
[01:11:13.884 --> 01:11:15.025]  I'm implying he did it alone.
[01:11:15.065 --> 01:11:15.865]  It's admitted fact.
[01:11:15.905 --> 01:11:19.809]  There's video of the BAT up on the ground, and the feds there, they did it.
[01:11:19.889 --> 01:11:21.590]  It's absolute documented historical fact.
[01:11:21.690 --> 01:11:34.738]  Yes, but he participated in it all the same, but even still, the fact still remains, what I'm trying to say, we have the information about Prince of Darkness, Mr. Pike, in his letter in England, that he wrote in the 1870s.
[01:11:35.198 --> 01:11:41.282]  Okay, he talks about the three world wars, and then the last one is supposed to be against the Arabs.
[01:11:41.602 --> 01:11:47.426]  Now we know, based on that, that you're supposed to attack Christians and Muslims who are of the Arab
[01:11:50.597 --> 01:12:05.840]  But the point I'm getting at is, there's over a billion Muslims in the world, and they're not in opposition to the Americans, they're not terrorists, they're not killing people, they're hardworking people, they're family members, and they want peace and happiness just like everybody else.
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:12.382]  The problem is that most of them sit on top of what the world wants most, and that's the oil.
[01:12:14.101 --> 01:12:16.083]  And that's the bottom line.
[01:12:16.123 --> 01:12:17.744]  I'm not really getting your point here.
[01:12:18.205 --> 01:12:25.852]  I mean, look, there are a lot of Muslims out there, just like there are a lot of any other group, that want domination, that want global domination.
[01:12:25.872 --> 01:12:28.494]  A lot of these mullahs and leaders are thugs.
[01:12:28.775 --> 01:12:31.477]  They're power corrupts, absolute power corrupts, absolutely.
[01:12:31.898 --> 01:12:38.204]  They do want to expand, but I'm telling you the most radical, and there was a Washington Post article, you know, the ABCs of Jihad,
[01:12:38.925 --> 01:12:44.572]  Uh, and how the CIA paid for tens of millions of dollars worth of textbooks saying kill the Americans.
[01:12:45.212 --> 01:12:47.315]  The CIA created Al Qaeda.
[01:12:47.575 --> 01:12:51.020]  They create these radical movements to create the global crisis.
[01:12:53.943 --> 01:12:57.126]  A half a percent of the whole Muslim world.
[01:12:57.246 --> 01:13:00.048]  Well I agree with you and that's why the CIA had to create them.
[01:13:00.288 --> 01:13:06.293]  But I'm saying in the whole process the whole Muslim religion and people are being vilified.
[01:13:06.313 --> 01:13:08.054]  Sir, let me go back to the subject though.
[01:13:08.374 --> 01:13:16.000]  What do you think of my analysis of who is really behind the torture and the murder of this guy?
[01:13:17.041 --> 01:13:19.743]  Because to me it's clear that it's a PSYOP program.
[01:13:20.123 --> 01:13:20.903]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:13:21.123 --> 01:13:26.884]  And if you look at the soldiers, their hands aren't dark like an Arab.
[01:13:26.924 --> 01:13:27.804]  Their hands are white.
[01:13:28.245 --> 01:13:46.848]  I wouldn't be surprised if they're some kind of... No, they're clearly... I've talked to people who are Arab, and those are Arab accents, and those are... But clearly, they have whole squads of people who are admitted former torture masters for the Shah there.
[01:13:47.916 --> 01:13:48.837]  So that's all admitted.
[01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:49.477]  Thank you for the call.
[01:13:49.517 --> 01:13:51.519]  I really appreciate the call, sir.
[01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:58.384]  I mean, yeah, the well pampered, taken care of CIA Arabs aren't going to be out in the sun a lot.
[01:13:58.884 --> 01:14:01.666]  And their hands do look white, and they are overweight.
[01:14:02.167 --> 01:14:02.967]  Forget all that.
[01:14:03.368 --> 01:14:06.310]  The CIA amicably created, controls Al Qaeda.
[01:14:06.650 --> 01:14:08.111]  They have this guy in their custody.
[01:14:08.131 --> 01:14:09.993]  They release him right into Al Qaeda control.
[01:14:10.233 --> 01:14:11.053]  And then this happens.
[01:14:11.894 --> 01:14:13.035]  Come on, people!
[01:14:13.955 --> 01:14:14.616]  Let's go ahead.
[01:14:14.636 --> 01:14:15.897]  I mean, it's right in your face.
[01:14:15.957 --> 01:14:17.118]  The family's saying this.
[01:14:18.263 --> 01:14:21.046]  And the neocons will be calling them democratic operatives within the hour.
[01:14:21.466 --> 01:14:22.147]  Already doing it.
[01:14:22.707 --> 01:14:25.630]  Let's go ahead and talk to Charles in Louisiana.
[01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:26.751]  Charles, go ahead.
[01:14:26.771 --> 01:14:27.571]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[01:14:27.751 --> 01:14:28.632]  Hello.
[01:14:29.113 --> 01:14:30.474]  The truth will set you free.
[01:14:30.534 --> 01:14:31.175]  Show the tape.
[01:14:31.955 --> 01:14:36.339]  The family knows that their son was set up and it will come out sooner or later.
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.442]  And this will let them know how vicious they are.
[01:14:40.037 --> 01:14:44.380]  And besides, other pictures are coming out, I understand, of more violent pictures.
[01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:48.523]  This woman that tortured these prisoners was on the news this morning.
[01:14:48.563 --> 01:14:51.065]  She was ordered to do it, of course they were ordered.
[01:14:51.305 --> 01:14:52.986]  The Pentagon admits they ordered it.
[01:14:53.867 --> 01:15:00.171]  It's all admitted, but it's in the back of the news wire, and the neocons and the liberals on TV won't bring this up.
[01:15:00.792 --> 01:15:09.618]  We won't make it the centerpiece issue, and now it's going to black out, blank out, all of the real news of raping and torturing women and children.
[01:15:10.078 --> 01:15:12.579]  Which is just as bad as cutting people's heads off.
[01:15:12.859 --> 01:15:19.602]  Beating people to death after you rape them is just as bad as cutting their head off, and it's all evil, and it's all out of control.
[01:15:19.942 --> 01:15:21.343]  Well, they were killing them with rocks.
[01:15:21.363 --> 01:15:23.044]  They were knocking their brains out with rocks.
[01:15:23.124 --> 01:15:28.066]  The Iraqi prisoners, they investigated them.
[01:15:28.086 --> 01:15:30.067]  Now they're taking rocks and beating their brains out.
[01:15:30.604 --> 01:15:38.527]  So show the film, I believe it's good, because I wish, like I was told you last time I seen you, I wish I had pictures of the young boy they raped.
[01:15:38.627 --> 01:15:39.267]  I seen this.
[01:15:39.527 --> 01:15:41.287]  If I had a picture, I could prove it.
[01:15:41.648 --> 01:15:43.908]  But a picture has a thousand words.
[01:15:43.948 --> 01:15:45.109]  That was when you were in prison?
[01:15:45.289 --> 01:15:46.609]  Yeah, they raped a boy.
[01:15:46.649 --> 01:15:47.729]  He was about 18 years old.
[01:15:47.749 --> 01:15:49.430]  They said he thought he was a man.
[01:15:49.930 --> 01:15:51.351]  And they're going to show him he wasn't.
[01:15:51.371 --> 01:15:53.771]  They were biting him, cursing him, calling him.
[01:15:54.212 --> 01:15:54.852]  I've seen this.
[01:15:54.932 --> 01:15:57.013]  Of course, he was only about 18 years old.
[01:15:57.073 --> 01:15:57.813]  I've seen this.
[01:15:57.933 --> 01:15:59.833]  And this was jail guards in Louisiana?
[01:16:00.054 --> 01:16:00.774]  Yes, sir.
[01:16:00.874 --> 01:16:07.436]  I know, every couple days we see articles in prisons of videotaping, raping women, men, beating them to death.
[01:16:07.516 --> 01:16:09.277]  It's just back of the newspaper.
[01:16:09.377 --> 01:16:11.017]  It's just, oh, a little abuse.
[01:16:11.397 --> 01:16:12.778]  And the warden knew this happened.
[01:16:13.158 --> 01:16:14.238]  The warden knew this happened.
[01:16:14.318 --> 01:16:14.898]  I've seen it.
[01:16:15.299 --> 01:16:16.599]  I wish I had seen it.
[01:16:16.679 --> 01:16:22.260]  It's admitted that they were told by the CIA the general was blocked out of the area, wasn't allowed to go in there.
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:23.601]  Then they go after her.
[01:16:23.681 --> 01:16:25.661]  That way when there's a trial, she's found not guilty.
[01:16:25.681 --> 01:16:27.502]  And they go, oh look, we didn't do anything.
[01:16:27.642 --> 01:16:30.322]  Well, yeah, because she went after an innocent person.
[01:16:30.382 --> 01:16:33.083]  This general that they're trying to burn.
[01:16:33.623 --> 01:16:38.264]  Well, Mr. Jones, we've got to let the people see how vicious they are.
[01:16:38.624 --> 01:16:41.045]  If other people are showing it, you should show it.
[01:16:41.607 --> 01:16:44.409]  Because it's going to come out that he was set up.
[01:16:45.109 --> 01:16:46.570]  Well, the family's already saying that.
[01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:47.230]  Thanks for the call.
[01:16:47.691 --> 01:16:49.011]  The globalists are so sloppy.
[01:16:49.912 --> 01:16:54.054]  All the hijackers having their houses and cars paid for by the CIA.
[01:16:54.414 --> 01:16:55.795]  The Bushes and the Cabinet.
[01:16:55.835 --> 01:16:57.676]  Everybody meeting with bin Laden's that day.
[01:16:58.137 --> 01:16:58.737]  Generals.
[01:16:58.797 --> 01:17:00.338]  I mean, just all stage people.
[01:17:01.024 --> 01:17:13.456]  But they count on you... The general public can't even face the fact that there are 12 bills to reintroduce the draft, they've set up the draft boards, they're getting selective service ready for women, Associated Press, and people still deny there's even a draft coming.
[01:17:13.716 --> 01:17:15.038]  I mean, that's the level of denial.
[01:17:16.619 --> 01:17:19.662]  So you deny that our troops are beating women to death and raping children.
[01:17:19.702 --> 01:17:20.303]  Well, okay.
[01:17:21.028 --> 01:17:21.648]  But it's a minute.
[01:17:21.969 --> 01:17:24.069]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sean in Wisconsin.
[01:17:24.109 --> 01:17:24.850]  Sean, go ahead.
[01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:25.590]  Hi.
[01:17:25.610 --> 01:17:30.712]  I think it's kind of pointless to use these videos and whatnot to try to prove to people what's going on.
[01:17:30.832 --> 01:17:35.274]  Yahweh purposely has hardened the minds of these individuals, and of these people, and of these masses.
[01:17:35.655 --> 01:17:36.715]  They're not supposed to see.
[01:17:37.175 --> 01:17:41.097]  Mark 4 11 tells us, to us, to you and I, Alex, to our Christian brethren,
[01:17:41.482 --> 01:17:42.683]  This message has been given.
[01:17:42.823 --> 01:17:43.663]  To them, it is not.
[01:17:44.083 --> 01:17:46.125]  I'm not going to tell you that it really is like that.
[01:17:46.465 --> 01:17:51.167]  You will tell somebody, here's the news, here's the Army report admitting they're raping women.
[01:17:51.387 --> 01:17:52.548]  And they'll say, I don't believe it.
[01:17:53.249 --> 01:17:55.670]  A guy told me, quote, I only listen to Rush Limbaugh.
[01:17:55.850 --> 01:17:57.891]  And I said, the Army admits it.
[01:17:59.172 --> 01:17:59.492]  Forget him.
[01:17:59.532 --> 01:18:00.292]  He's never going to see.
[01:18:00.312 --> 01:18:01.593]  These people aren't ever going to see.
[01:18:01.613 --> 01:18:02.113]  And you know what?
[01:18:02.133 --> 01:18:03.094]  We don't have to make it
[01:18:03.604 --> 01:18:05.586]  Our point is to go out and prove it to these heathens.
[01:18:05.606 --> 01:18:09.751]  Now wait a minute, we've got to talk, and in between the swine, you're going to have good people that listen.
[01:18:09.951 --> 01:18:11.032]  Well you are, but you know what?
[01:18:11.052 --> 01:18:12.974]  Yahweh's going to bring them to Him naturally.
[01:18:12.994 --> 01:18:15.977]  There's children, there's chosen, they're going to be drawn to Him.
[01:18:16.478 --> 01:18:19.521]  But there's a lot of ignorant people out there, and don't waste your time on them, you know?
[01:18:21.806 --> 01:18:25.307]  I just don't think there's really any point in showing the raping of children.
[01:18:25.527 --> 01:18:27.067]  I think that, oh, it's garbage.
[01:18:27.107 --> 01:18:28.728]  Well, that video hasn't been released yet.
[01:18:28.808 --> 01:18:29.448]  They admit it.
[01:18:29.508 --> 01:18:32.129]  The senators are watching it, literally, right now.
[01:18:32.169 --> 01:18:33.749]  They get three hours today to watch it.
[01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:37.290]  Hundreds of videos, thousands of photos, and it's admitted.
[01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:40.911]  I mean, how did they find people to rape children?
[01:18:42.191 --> 01:18:43.212]  What happened to us?
[01:18:44.152 --> 01:18:44.772]  What happened?
[01:18:45.232 --> 01:18:45.772]  Well, I don't know.
[01:18:45.812 --> 01:18:48.353]  I mean, we were being governed by the children of Satan.
[01:18:49.090 --> 01:18:50.231]  You know, that's what happened.
[01:18:50.251 --> 01:18:51.492]  These things are meant to happen.
[01:18:51.512 --> 01:18:52.672]  These evils are meant to happen.
[01:18:52.692 --> 01:18:55.814]  It's horrible, but there's nothing we can do about it until then.
[01:18:55.854 --> 01:19:00.777]  But what I think, in the meantime, is us Christians, we should start stocking up our food, start stocking up our munitions.
[01:19:00.797 --> 01:19:01.838]  You talk about Christians!
[01:19:01.918 --> 01:19:04.720]  It's the Christian talk shows that are making excuses for all this!
[01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:08.062]  Well, if they were of us, they would stay with us, but they're not of us.
[01:19:09.643 --> 01:19:11.324]  They're misguided.
[01:19:11.384 --> 01:19:17.048]  They're misguided in being led by false Judeo-Christian doctrines, anyhow.
[01:19:18.215 --> 01:19:28.980]  Basically, what I'm trying to say is, Alex, when we have martial law, and when we have concentration camps, and when we're killing Muslims left and right in our own country, we're not going to have a choice to believe this or not.
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:34.682]  When Yahweh, our Heavenly Father, is standing right before us, judging these heathens, we're not going to have a choice.
[01:19:34.742 --> 01:19:36.263]  Just keep on doing your job, brother.
[01:19:36.663 --> 01:19:38.864]  You're doing a wonderful job, and Yahweh loves you for it.
[01:19:38.884 --> 01:19:39.764]  But let me ask you this.
[01:19:40.384 --> 01:19:46.307]  Do you honestly think showing this video of Nick would please Yahweh, our Father, our God?
[01:19:48.115 --> 01:19:51.017]  You know, I rarely don't know.
[01:19:51.217 --> 01:19:51.818]  I don't know.
[01:19:51.838 --> 01:19:52.538]  We'll be back.

[01:20:55.229 --> 01:20:56.230]  Spring has arrived!
[01:20:56.410 --> 01:20:59.373]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:20:59.593 --> 01:21:03.056]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:21:03.256 --> 01:21:11.423]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[01:21:53.951 --> 01:21:57.613]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:21:58.013 --> 01:22:03.435]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:22:03.916 --> 01:22:04.976]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:22:05.016 --> 01:22:09.058]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:22:09.708 --> 01:22:23.000]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:28.825]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:22:29.145 --> 01:22:35.030]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:22:35.777 --> 01:22:37.578]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:38.619 --> 01:22:41.801]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[01:22:42.221 --> 01:22:43.402]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:45.323 --> 01:22:50.986]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:22:51.006 --> 01:22:51.366]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:52.987 --> 01:22:55.769]  What kind of gift can you give to someone who has everything?
[01:22:56.189 --> 01:22:57.270]  Are you running out of ideas?
[01:22:57.730 --> 01:22:58.351]  Out of time?
[01:22:58.831 --> 01:23:02.013]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?
[01:23:02.697 --> 01:23:05.539]  Well, think of a song written especially for them.
[01:23:05.839 --> 01:23:13.765]  And all you have to do is go to www.songsforever.com and provide us all the information about that special someone.
[01:23:14.185 --> 01:23:17.487]  Interesting facts, unique things about him, and all you can think of.
[01:23:17.827 --> 01:23:25.853]  Songsforever.com will use that information brought to us by you to compose a unique song with original lyrics inspired by everything you've told us.
[01:23:26.413 --> 01:23:26.914]  Just listen.
[01:23:34.957 --> 01:23:40.483]  Birthday coming soon?
[01:23:40.883 --> 01:23:41.584]  Anniversary?
[01:23:42.064 --> 01:23:42.785]  Wedding perhaps?
[01:23:43.385 --> 01:23:44.346]  Mother's Day coming up?
[01:23:44.907 --> 01:23:48.851]  Just go to www.songsforever.com.
[01:23:49.311 --> 01:23:51.613]  That's www.songsforever.com.
[01:24:04.219 --> 01:24:06.660]  Well, I tell you, I've thought about it long and hard.
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:13.202]  And if they release a video of our troops cutting people's heads off, I think we'd post it.
[01:24:15.303 --> 01:24:19.784]  And it's now starting to proliferate, others are now posting it, so I think we'll go ahead and post it.
[01:24:20.044 --> 01:24:24.065]  And it'll be on the sub-page, so if you go to the main page, you won't see it.
[01:24:24.906 --> 01:24:28.187]  At PrisonPlanet.tv, and we'll put it back up in the next 20-30 minutes.
[01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:32.721]  Because it's not broadcast television.
[01:24:32.821 --> 01:24:34.401]  It's not where children are flipping past.
[01:24:34.441 --> 01:24:35.902]  I would not air it on TV.
[01:24:35.922 --> 01:24:37.962]  The more I think about it.
[01:24:38.482 --> 01:24:40.603]  But I won't air it on my own TV show.
[01:24:40.643 --> 01:24:42.084]  I may show some still images of it.
[01:24:42.124 --> 01:24:47.785]  We have some still images on Infowars.com, on PrisonPlanet.com, on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:24:49.486 --> 01:24:51.546]  But the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[01:24:51.566 --> 01:24:54.267]  And I think that we're supposed to see this.
[01:24:54.287 --> 01:24:54.967]  This is real.
[01:24:56.908 --> 01:24:59.789]  My gut level is, do it.
[01:25:00.995 --> 01:25:03.476]  But I've just been hesitant just because it's so distressing.
[01:25:04.437 --> 01:25:13.260]  We need to see the face of evil, and it needs to obviously be blurred out any sexual stuff, but that all needs to be put out.
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:18.862]  The raping of these women, at least stills of it, the torturing them to death.
[01:25:19.903 --> 01:25:24.745]  We need to know the truth, instead of just denying it and rationalizing it.
[01:25:24.765 --> 01:25:27.886]  This may shake some people out of their mind control.
[01:25:28.889 --> 01:25:32.273]  Uh, let's go ahead and talk to Kevin in Texas.
[01:25:32.314 --> 01:25:33.014]  Kevin, go ahead.
[01:25:33.034 --> 01:25:34.676]  Hey Alex, good day.
[01:25:34.696 --> 01:25:36.499]  Hello sir, what do you think about the video?
[01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:42.987]  Um, I just, well I... It's a plan, just like you said.
[01:25:43.007 --> 01:25:47.292]  I, just right now I'm questioning when we have to track these evil people down or...
[01:25:47.975 --> 01:25:49.236]  Are they going to run to Iran?
[01:25:49.296 --> 01:25:50.496]  Are they going to run to Syria?
[01:25:50.536 --> 01:25:53.198]  What is this enabling us to do?
[01:25:53.238 --> 01:25:54.519]  What is the next step for us?
[01:25:55.079 --> 01:25:58.421]  Ah yes, the CIA, Al Qaeda ran to another country.
[01:25:58.441 --> 01:26:01.862]  And of course now the head guy with the knife supposedly died three months ago.
[01:26:02.343 --> 01:26:04.404]  That just, that locks it in right there.
[01:26:04.444 --> 01:26:08.326]  But I was there last night when these discussions were going on.
[01:26:08.346 --> 01:26:09.867]  At the TV studio, yeah.
[01:26:11.275 --> 01:26:20.462]  I want to engage, but at the same time, I've kind of started to find the best tool is just to laugh at them and walk away, not even to drop down to their level.
[01:26:21.083 --> 01:26:26.086]  People will be critical of you sometimes because when you do one of your rants, they'll say, look at this guy.
[01:26:26.107 --> 01:26:27.267]  He's so emotional.
[01:26:27.287 --> 01:26:29.129]  He's got to be out of his mind.
[01:26:29.729 --> 01:26:31.210]  You use discernment.
[01:26:31.471 --> 01:26:33.192]  You have a guidebook of history.
[01:26:33.592 --> 01:26:34.933]  You use their own documents.
[01:26:34.953 --> 01:26:38.176]  You sit there and you analyze this thing, maybe with a bit of a cynical eye.
[01:26:38.772 --> 01:26:39.393]  We're good to go.
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:00.002]  And, you know, these messages are not out there for me and you.
[01:27:00.442 --> 01:27:02.123]  They're out there for Joe Sixpack.
[01:27:02.284 --> 01:27:05.646]  Who's running around screaming, torture them, kill them all, ha ha ha.
[01:27:05.806 --> 01:27:09.248]  Well, wait, if it's bad that they're torturing and killing, how is it suddenly okay for us?
[01:27:09.568 --> 01:27:10.769]  That's double think.
[01:27:11.049 --> 01:27:13.670]  Just because somebody else does something bad doesn't mean you get to.
[01:27:14.011 --> 01:27:16.172]  And these people are good-hearted people.
[01:27:16.232 --> 01:27:17.032]  They mean well.
[01:27:17.092 --> 01:27:23.896]  And they just, everyone has their little hot-button topic that they cling to.
[01:27:26.563 --> 01:27:31.086]  Things are becoming so fractured now and everyone has almost a conspiracy theory.
[01:27:31.106 --> 01:27:35.829]  Well look, last night on the TV show, and that special report will be up later this week, we just posted a new one yesterday.
[01:27:37.173 --> 01:27:42.038]  I'm going to post multiple a week for a while, not just one a week, on the members section of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:27:42.379 --> 01:27:43.960]  I went over this Associated Press report.
[01:27:44.301 --> 01:27:46.323]  The family isn't just saying, you made this happen.
[01:27:46.383 --> 01:27:47.925]  They're saying, hey, this is suspicious.
[01:27:48.225 --> 01:27:59.157]  You grab him, won't let him leave, won't let him call anybody, release him right into Al Qaeda's hands, which is admittedly CIA, and then he ends up dead, and now this video comes in at the perfect time for all of this.
[01:28:00.317 --> 01:28:07.279]  And they grabbed him right after they told CBS to hold off a few weeks while they were getting ready and staging all this.
[01:28:07.479 --> 01:28:08.679]  This isn't my opinion, Kevin.
[01:28:08.919 --> 01:28:10.280]  Al Qaeda is CIA.
[01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:11.940]  They use them to create crises.
[01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:13.661]  They capture him.
[01:28:13.861 --> 01:28:16.361]  They release him right into Al Qaeda hands.
[01:28:17.082 --> 01:28:18.742]  Kevin, this is obvious.
[01:28:19.122 --> 01:28:24.088]  Well, I hope the Berg family should be commended, and I hope they have the resolve that at least Jessica Lynch decided to add.
[01:28:24.128 --> 01:28:25.129]  Yeah, we're trying to get a hold of them.
[01:28:25.229 --> 01:28:27.472]  I know they're getting a million calls, but we're trying to get a hold of them.
[01:28:27.732 --> 01:28:33.759]  Remember before Jessica Lynch's father started speaking out, they were ready to give her the Congressional Medal of Honor, and it was really her father
[01:28:34.179 --> 01:28:34.580]  We're good to go.
[01:28:56.375 --> 01:29:01.160]  Would be having a barbecue in the backyard and a guy in a black ski mask would double tap him in the head.
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:03.883]  They'd die in car wrecks and drown in an inch of water.
[01:29:03.903 --> 01:29:05.884]  I mean, this is scripted, people!
[01:29:06.225 --> 01:29:08.347]  They got Jerry Bruckheimer in there!
[01:29:08.367 --> 01:29:09.908]  Do you understand?
[01:29:10.069 --> 01:29:10.709]  In Qatar!
[01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:12.211]  Running this stuff!
[01:29:12.571 --> 01:29:15.153]  Alex, I believe... What is... BBC!
[01:29:15.394 --> 01:29:16.194]  Bruckheimer!
[01:29:16.415 --> 01:29:17.556]  Pirates of the Caribbean!
[01:29:18.672 --> 01:29:19.412]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:29:19.432 --> 01:29:28.037]  You need to show the video, but maybe before you allow people access to the video, they should have to read a synopsis of what you lay down, and use a little discernment.
[01:29:28.057 --> 01:29:33.140]  Well, I think that's the positive here, is that people who come to see it will get what really happened.
[01:29:33.701 --> 01:29:38.463]  Instead of neocons, who are out there putting this out, giving them their lives.
[01:29:38.764 --> 01:29:40.124]  The truth shall set you free, brother.
[01:29:40.144 --> 01:29:40.825]  Alright, thank you.
[01:29:40.865 --> 01:29:42.406]  We'll be right back with more calls, more news.
[01:29:42.426 --> 01:29:42.926]  Stay with us.
[01:29:44.275 --> 01:29:45.336]  This is GCN.
[01:29:45.356 --> 01:29:46.077]  Don't run.
[01:29:46.237 --> 01:29:47.858]  We are your friends.
[01:29:49.139 --> 01:29:52.261]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:29:53.983 --> 01:29:55.904]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter.
[01:29:56.004 --> 01:30:01.509]  An inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:30:01.769 --> 01:30:12.698]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:30:12.878 --> 01:30:13.259]  We're good to go!
[01:30:29.421 --> 01:30:29.942]  That's right!
[01:30:30.122 --> 01:30:37.228]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:30:37.528 --> 01:30:41.652]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[01:30:41.812 --> 01:30:46.275]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:46.295 --> 01:30:46.776]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:55.018 --> 01:31:01.079]  Most so-called tax shelters try to show you how to reduce your taxes, but they still insist that you must pay taxes.
[01:31:01.439 --> 01:31:07.720]  And they require that you do goofy, bizarre things with your money that you'd never normally do just so you can save a few bucks.
[01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:09.481]  Not this tax shelter!
[01:31:09.921 --> 01:31:18.422]  It's so complete, it's so superior, that it will teach you how to properly comply with the tax laws and still end up with zero tax liability.
[01:31:18.702 --> 01:31:19.202]  Imagine!
[01:31:19.482 --> 01:31:22.723]  You find out that you've been deceived about what the tax laws require
[01:31:23.303 --> 01:31:26.244]  And you learn how to obey them better than you ever have before.
[01:31:26.424 --> 01:31:28.944]  And as a result, you end up owing the government nothing.
[01:31:29.344 --> 01:31:32.705]  You get to keep every single dime of your hard-earned money.
[01:31:33.105 --> 01:31:33.785]  Sound amazing?
[01:31:34.225 --> 01:31:35.305]  Sound too good to be true?
[01:31:35.845 --> 01:31:36.845]  Find out for yourself.
[01:31:37.345 --> 01:31:39.566]  Go to besttaxshelter.com.
[01:31:39.606 --> 01:31:43.967]  That's besttaxshelter, all one word, dot com on the internet.
[01:31:44.267 --> 01:31:46.707]  And find out what the government has been scared to death.
[01:31:46.727 --> 01:31:47.387]  You'll find out.
[01:31:48.067 --> 01:31:50.108]  besttaxshelter.com.
[01:31:50.188 --> 01:31:51.068]  You'll be astonished.
[01:31:51.308 --> 01:31:51.888]  Visit today.
[01:31:54.122 --> 01:31:58.484]  Most of us have had a cafe we frequented because the service was so wonderful or the food was so great.
[01:31:58.624 --> 01:32:05.688]  The Silver Bear Cafe understands this philosophy and has incorporated these ideals into a website that offers food for thought to nourish the mind.
[01:32:05.968 --> 01:32:12.872]  Membership in the bear consists of a large and growing group of patriots who, like you, realize there are things in this great country that need changing right away.
[01:32:13.192 --> 01:32:20.676]  The Silver Bear Cafe provides you with an income opportunity that will provide you and your family with an ongoing revenue stream in return for simply spreading the message.
[01:32:21.076 --> 01:32:27.020]  So many of you have been trying to get the message out individually, but collectively our voices are strong and cannot be silenced.
[01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:34.684]  Membership in the bear will teach you the secrets of financial freedom, how the runaway government is crushing the American dream, why wars are played out across the globe,
[01:32:34.884 --> 01:32:36.825]  The Fractional Reserve System, etc.
[01:32:37.025 --> 01:32:39.686]  Where we're headed and what you can do to prepare yourself.
[01:32:40.026 --> 01:32:41.107]  Knowledge is power.
[01:32:41.347 --> 01:32:46.269]  Feed your mind and feed your financial independence with a visit to SilverBearCafe.com.
[01:32:46.409 --> 01:32:48.470]  That's SilverBearCafe.com.
[01:32:48.610 --> 01:32:51.792]  Do it today and preserve this country's greatness for generations to come.
[01:33:04.109 --> 01:33:11.832]  Alright, let's blast through your calls on this important issue of the cutting off of the head of this poor man, Nick Berg.
[01:33:12.192 --> 01:33:13.053]  Why is it so important?
[01:33:13.073 --> 01:33:22.436]  Because it will legitimize the war, legitimize torture, it will be a huge political distraction, it will escalate things, and then you look at the M.O.
[01:33:22.497 --> 01:33:24.137]  of this, it's got L.C.I.
[01:33:24.257 --> 01:33:25.378]  Ada written all over it.
[01:33:26.238 --> 01:33:26.658]  In U.S.
[01:33:26.678 --> 01:33:28.039]  custody, given to L.C.I.
[01:33:28.139 --> 01:33:30.180]  Ada, and this comes out right on time.
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:31.140]  Isn't that just perfect?
[01:33:32.762 --> 01:33:37.306]  I mean, what Arab group in their right mind would do stuff like this and then bring down the wrath of the New World Order?
[01:33:37.606 --> 01:33:43.671]  You see, every time it's CIA, Al-Ciida, Al-Ciida, right when they need the help, this happens.
[01:33:43.871 --> 01:33:44.412]  Every time.
[01:33:44.772 --> 01:33:46.754]  Perhaps I should go over some of those examples.
[01:33:47.955 --> 01:33:50.217]  Let us go ahead and take a call.
[01:33:50.237 --> 01:33:51.958]  Let's go through these quickly.
[01:33:52.018 --> 01:33:55.081]  Let's talk to Dan in Texas.
[01:33:55.121 --> 01:33:55.901]  Dan, go ahead.
[01:33:56.762 --> 01:33:57.242]  Yes, sir.
[01:33:57.523 --> 01:33:58.924]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:33:59.716 --> 01:34:02.637]  I want to put a quick plug in for PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:34:02.697 --> 01:34:19.540]  I've recently subscribed, my family and myself, and it's really wonderful because we can sit down at our leisure and download the video and watch, and it's similar to the mainstream propaganda news programs.
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:23.961]  You deliver the video in an anchor-style fashion.
[01:34:24.001 --> 01:34:28.282]  You're sitting at a desk covering the main important issues that are in the news.
[01:34:28.726 --> 01:34:29.486]  I'd like to thank you.
[01:34:29.526 --> 01:34:33.708]  I subscribe and I'm very happy and it condenses all the most important points.
[01:34:33.928 --> 01:34:35.689]  Well, I want to thank you for your support.
[01:34:36.649 --> 01:34:45.252]  And then also in terms of this video with the gentleman having his head cut off, I think maybe you want to put that on the subscriber side of the site because
[01:34:46.129 --> 01:34:48.850]  To have a credit card means you're at least 18 years old.
[01:35:08.707 --> 01:35:10.008]  Not the last break, the break before last.
[01:35:10.048 --> 01:35:11.329]  I said, what do you think?
[01:35:11.369 --> 01:35:12.410]  And he said, well, I know this.
[01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:16.373]  If we get video of them cutting prisoners' heads off, we need to post it.
[01:35:16.913 --> 01:35:20.116]  And he goes, even though I don't even want to watch this clip again, he said, maybe we should.
[01:35:20.136 --> 01:35:22.357]  And I said, yeah, you know, people need to see this.
[01:35:22.878 --> 01:35:25.900]  So it's going up on PrisonPlanet.TV here in the next few minutes.
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:26.761]  Yes, sir.
[01:35:26.781 --> 01:35:34.446]  And then the other thing I'd like to mention is I'm in the Dallas area, and they just launched a brand new AM station, 660K Sky.
[01:35:35.988 --> 01:35:41.533]  And the General Manager's taking solicitations for suggestions on programming.
[01:35:42.014 --> 01:35:42.414]  Okay.
[01:35:42.754 --> 01:35:52.423]  And so I'd just like to say, anyone in the Dallas area, if you go to ksky.com or I believe it's my opinion at ksky.com, the General Manager takes emails.
[01:35:52.843 --> 01:35:55.286]  Well, I would love to be on in my hometown of Dallas.
[01:35:55.906 --> 01:36:06.310]  And, uh, you know, I know I, my family, myself, my wife, we've all emailed and encouraged other people to email because their lineup is just a neocon propaganda from dusk till dawn.
[01:36:06.670 --> 01:36:10.391]  It's like some of the introductory graphics you have on your downloadable video.
[01:36:10.791 --> 01:36:14.953]  It shows the broadcast antenna with the pulsating lies coming out of the top.
[01:36:15.373 --> 01:36:16.473]  And that's exactly what's on.
[01:36:16.494 --> 01:36:20.175]  They got Savage and Prager and Medved and Big Ben.
[01:36:20.195 --> 01:36:21.615]  All the ultra liberals, yes.
[01:36:21.635 --> 01:36:23.276]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:36:24.099 --> 01:36:25.501]  But that's all I had, Alex.
[01:36:25.541 --> 01:36:27.222]  And again, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:36:27.282 --> 01:36:27.943]  I don't know you.
[01:36:28.003 --> 01:36:31.327]  I'm just telling everyone who's listening, especially if you're pressed for time.
[01:36:31.527 --> 01:36:32.648]  I didn't have to work today.
[01:36:33.289 --> 01:36:38.114]  But if you're a busy type of person, you get all of the most important details summarized.
[01:36:38.134 --> 01:36:41.217]  You can download the video, watch it, and it's really excellent.
[01:36:41.357 --> 01:36:41.898]  Well, thank you.
[01:36:41.938 --> 01:36:42.598]  I appreciate it.
[01:36:42.638 --> 01:36:43.199]  God bless you.
[01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:47.441]  Let's now go ahead and talk to John in New Jersey.
[01:36:47.501 --> 01:36:48.282]  John, go ahead.
[01:36:48.302 --> 01:36:49.682]  Hey, thanks for taking my call out.
[01:36:49.822 --> 01:36:50.182]  You bet.
[01:36:50.582 --> 01:36:51.223]  I agree.
[01:36:51.263 --> 01:36:55.584]  I think you should post the video and put a little synopsis as to the significance of it.
[01:36:55.604 --> 01:37:01.726]  There's no question in my mind this is an intelligence operation, because you have to look at who stands to gain.
[01:37:03.607 --> 01:37:07.188]  And you also have to wonder, why didn't they ransom this guy?
[01:37:07.248 --> 01:37:11.990]  Why did all of a sudden, out of nowhere, they release this video on a website?
[01:37:14.022 --> 01:37:19.564]  Well, again, I will repeat, his family isn't just saying, hey, you caused this because you held him.
[01:37:19.804 --> 01:37:21.064]  They're saying, this is suspicious.
[01:37:21.084 --> 01:37:30.126]  You had him for 13 days, you released him, and in 24 hours, he's in Al-Qaeda hands, getting his head cut off, and then who stands to gain from this?
[01:37:30.186 --> 01:37:32.907]  And then, we know the CIA controls Al-Qaeda.
[01:37:33.107 --> 01:37:34.027]  That's admitted fact.
[01:37:34.067 --> 01:37:38.908]  So, with all that evidence, I mean, if it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, you know, this is it.
[01:37:39.428 --> 01:37:42.169]  Exactly, and the Zarqawi guy that supposedly
[01:37:43.401 --> 01:37:46.343]  He was reported to be dead months ago.
[01:37:46.403 --> 01:37:47.964]  Yeah, MSNBC.
[01:37:48.164 --> 01:37:48.965]  Dead three months ago.
[01:37:49.285 --> 01:37:53.247]  And he had a prosthetic leg, so I didn't... I don't know.
[01:37:53.267 --> 01:37:55.308]  The whole thing is ridiculous.
[01:37:55.869 --> 01:38:01.452]  And already I saw on Fox News, Judge Napolitano saying, This is how the Iraqis are.
[01:38:01.492 --> 01:38:02.673]  We get to treat them badly.
[01:38:04.150 --> 01:38:22.105]  Yeah, and I have the Associated Press Army's own report that the Red Cross got, Army admits it's an accurate report, saying 70 to 90 percent of those held in the camp or grabbed at checkpoints, whole families who've done nothing, just haven't gotten the new coalition-issued national ID card that just came out a few months ago.
[01:38:22.445 --> 01:38:27.350]  They grab them and take them there, and these guys are all over radio and TV going, yeah, we gotta get tough, see, see?
[01:38:27.970 --> 01:38:30.451]  So now raping women and children is okay?
[01:38:30.651 --> 01:38:32.531]  Well, yeah, we're defending the homeland.
[01:38:32.751 --> 01:38:35.872]  And this guy, General Taguba, he testified yesterday, I think.
[01:38:36.412 --> 01:38:38.872]  And, you know, he's playing into the whole whitewash thing.
[01:38:38.892 --> 01:38:43.333]  Well, it was just a couple of bad apples and a leadership failure, not enough training.
[01:38:43.413 --> 01:38:46.114]  But he admits the raping of women and other stuff he can't mention.
[01:38:46.434 --> 01:38:49.595]  But then the neo-conscious is still denied that even happened.
[01:38:49.615 --> 01:38:50.075]  Well, exactly.
[01:38:50.095 --> 01:38:51.015]  That's the crazy thing.
[01:38:51.115 --> 01:38:54.856]  That he'll admit this in his own report and then say, well, it's really not that bad.
[01:38:55.795 --> 01:38:59.257]  The minions will go out and say, well, that's just a conspiracy theory.
[01:38:59.297 --> 01:38:59.898]  That doesn't exist.
[01:38:59.918 --> 01:39:01.338]  That's only what liberals talk about.
[01:39:02.859 --> 01:39:11.745]  You mean the liberals that sign campaign finance reform that are for open borders, that are signing on to UNESCO, that are going under U.N.
[01:39:11.785 --> 01:39:12.165]  control?
[01:39:12.205 --> 01:39:15.927]  You mean those liberals that are George W. Bush and his cousin, John Forms Carey?
[01:39:15.947 --> 01:39:16.487]  You mean those?
[01:39:16.728 --> 01:39:18.709]  Well, yeah, but they're just defending the homeland.
[01:39:19.651 --> 01:39:20.532]  I saw Rumsfeld.
[01:39:20.812 --> 01:39:21.893]  He's doing a great job.
[01:39:22.353 --> 01:39:23.814]  The superb job!
[01:39:23.854 --> 01:39:24.595]  The superb job!
[01:39:24.615 --> 01:39:25.415]  Superb!
[01:39:25.815 --> 01:39:33.561]  And you know, on The Shield, I just saw them beating up someone because they were dealing cocaine and they were, you know, impinging on their own business.
[01:39:33.841 --> 01:39:34.782]  The police department's business.
[01:39:35.655 --> 01:39:37.095]  I don't see what the big deal is.
[01:39:37.435 --> 01:39:38.916]  Every show tortures good, that's right.
[01:39:38.936 --> 01:39:39.476]  Thanks for the call.
[01:39:39.756 --> 01:39:40.716]  But it's bad when they do it.
[01:39:41.076 --> 01:39:45.317]  You've got to learn the double thing to stay sane in this 1984 paradigm.
[01:39:45.737 --> 01:39:46.257]  Thank you.
[01:39:46.337 --> 01:39:47.317]  Excellent points, John.
[01:39:47.417 --> 01:39:48.797]  Mark in West Virginia.
[01:39:48.857 --> 01:39:49.517]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:39:50.038 --> 01:39:53.058]  Sight of Marine Corps urban warfare takeover drills.
[01:39:53.618 --> 01:39:59.759]  And they admit they have brigades of troops ready to round you up and put you in your own camps where they break up the family and interrogate you.
[01:40:00.519 --> 01:40:01.259]  Welcome, Mark.
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:02.280]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:04.040]  Nice to speak with you again.
[01:40:05.253 --> 01:40:06.534]  Bear with me for one moment.
[01:40:07.795 --> 01:40:19.741]  When this thing came out about the war crimes and torture at the El Gray prison, the first thing that struck me is how utterly un-American it is, and not to mention inhumane.
[01:40:19.842 --> 01:40:20.842]  Hey, they're just having fun!
[01:40:20.862 --> 01:40:22.243]  They're just blowing off some steam!
[01:40:22.583 --> 01:40:25.705]  And the other thing was... I'll tell you what, I'll let you talk in a second.
[01:40:25.745 --> 01:40:27.346]  Get that Limbaugh clip ready for me.
[01:40:27.386 --> 01:40:28.126]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[01:40:28.687 --> 01:40:28.927]  Okay.
[01:40:29.527 --> 01:40:30.167]  The other thing is,
[01:40:31.952 --> 01:40:40.961]  One of the other things that struck me about this, how bizarre it would be to take hundreds or thousands of photos of these actions.
[01:40:41.041 --> 01:40:42.442]  It's utterly bizarre.
[01:40:42.782 --> 01:40:43.743]  They were ordered to!
[01:40:43.803 --> 01:40:45.865]  They said we were ordered to pose.
[01:40:46.266 --> 01:40:47.167]  We did it out in the open.
[01:40:47.187 --> 01:40:48.768]  There's officers looking at the photos.
[01:40:49.028 --> 01:40:50.690]  We were told to release dogs on them.
[01:40:50.910 --> 01:40:52.411]  We were told to do this to them.
[01:40:52.652 --> 01:40:52.992]  Yes sir.
[01:40:53.252 --> 01:40:54.273]  Now turn the page.
[01:40:54.714 --> 01:40:56.555]  And yesterday I watched the
[01:40:57.296 --> 01:41:00.798]  That General Toguba testified before Congress.
[01:41:00.878 --> 01:41:01.939]  Antonio Toguba!
[01:41:02.099 --> 01:41:02.459]  Yes, sir.
[01:41:02.559 --> 01:41:10.944]  He said that the people that committed these crimes were uniformed military personnel and private contractors.
[01:41:11.384 --> 01:41:24.131]  Now last night, after I listened to your show for three hours, a few hours later I heard someone call in on another show and say that there was a story out on the web that these
[01:41:24.827 --> 01:41:27.914]  Private contractors were actually Israeli Shin Bet.
[01:41:28.435 --> 01:41:32.866]  And it just looks like an Israeli spy op to create an even greater
[01:41:36.574 --> 01:41:39.595]  They admit that Israel does have advisors.
[01:41:39.615 --> 01:41:42.016]  They're the ones advising run-over cars with tanks.
[01:41:42.636 --> 01:41:45.677]  They're the ones advising bulldozed people's orchards.
[01:41:46.417 --> 01:41:54.540]  And it is deepening the crisis, but Israel isn't the one funding $7 billion of it with Rumsfeld's P2OG group.
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:55.440]  Let me read the headlines.
[01:41:56.312 --> 01:41:56.552]  Yes sir.
[01:41:56.612 --> 01:41:58.033]  And one last thing I'll mention.
[01:42:21.470 --> 01:42:30.917]  Saturday, in Unicoi County, Tennessee, near Irwin, Tennessee, two Israeli agents were caught with false ID.
[01:42:31.337 --> 01:42:36.201]  They drove at high speeds with an empty Ryder truck, trying to get away from the police.
[01:42:37.041 --> 01:42:43.586]  Before they got pulled over, they threw out a vial that was subsequently recovered, and when it was shaken, it got warm.
[01:42:46.375 --> 01:42:52.577]  It looks like another Israeli... There's been about five cases of them catching them with explosives.
[01:42:52.637 --> 01:42:56.318]  Explosives, residue, and then it's all diagrams of nuclear power plants.
[01:42:56.698 --> 01:42:57.159]  Yeah, I know.
[01:42:57.179 --> 01:42:59.039]  That's Fox News, by the way, what he just mentioned.
[01:42:59.059 --> 01:42:59.859]  Thanks for the call.
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:01.440]  I appreciate it, Mark.
[01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:04.661]  Let's talk to Mark in Minnesota.
[01:43:04.721 --> 01:43:05.541]  Mark, another Mark.
[01:43:05.601 --> 01:43:06.041]  Go ahead.
[01:43:06.061 --> 01:43:06.881]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:43:07.002 --> 01:43:07.382]  Fine.
[01:43:07.542 --> 01:43:09.482]  You're so right about the propaganda all over the TV.
[01:43:09.582 --> 01:43:11.783]  I seldom watch TV, but I turn on some programs like
[01:43:12.628 --> 01:43:16.313]  You know, JAG or something like that, and they're going after some suspect and, like, no...
[01:43:17.094 --> 01:43:24.060]  We don't have to, you know, the guy was asking for an attorney, so we don't have to give you an attorney because you're being treated as an enemy convent under the Patriot Act.
[01:43:24.461 --> 01:43:26.222]  And they do that on the show, Threat Matrix.
[01:43:26.502 --> 01:43:31.827]  A drug dealer has his children taken because we can use the Patriot Act and you don't get to ever see a lawyer.
[01:43:31.927 --> 01:43:37.432]  You're going to be taken to a foreign prison and we're going to put you in a torture chair until you die.
[01:43:37.752 --> 01:43:38.933]  Oh, because we're good guys.
[01:43:39.073 --> 01:43:41.555]  Yeah, it's everywhere.
[01:43:41.595 --> 01:43:44.458]  I just happened to turn on the TV and turn up that one program.
[01:43:45.383 --> 01:43:54.167]  You know, propaganda right there, but by the way, I find it laughable that these people weren't trained in... They admittedly were ordered to do it.
[01:43:54.468 --> 01:44:00.390]  Yeah, because I was in the Marine Corps, and in fact, I have some of my manuals from boot camps still.
[01:44:00.410 --> 01:44:03.352]  One of the first things we went over was, you know, the laws of war.
[01:44:03.917 --> 01:44:07.761]  Right there, it says, you know, hey, you're not supposed to torture or kill POWs?
[01:44:07.861 --> 01:44:10.783]  Well, regardless of it, it was the training.
[01:44:10.823 --> 01:44:11.724]  They were told to do this.
[01:44:11.744 --> 01:44:13.326]  They say lack of training.
[01:44:13.626 --> 01:44:17.810]  So now, Mark, if you go out and rape and kill somebody, just say, hey, it was lack of training.
[01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:18.390]  Thanks for the call.
[01:44:19.211 --> 01:44:21.873]  And by the way, you know, killing somebody is just abuse.
[01:44:21.933 --> 01:44:22.774]  It's not torture.
[01:44:23.114 --> 01:44:24.956]  Beating someone to death is just abuse.
[01:44:25.336 --> 01:44:26.597]  They'll charge you with murder.
[01:44:26.977 --> 01:44:28.719]  They're changing all the words around.
[01:44:28.919 --> 01:44:35.905]  They're on TV telling you torture is good in fiction and non-fiction and in every newspaper and then it comes out and then they legitimize it.
[01:44:36.065 --> 01:44:38.847]  They cut this guy's head off and say that the Arabs did it.
[01:44:39.047 --> 01:44:40.128]  It's so obvious!
[01:44:40.328 --> 01:44:42.650]  They had him in custody and gave him to them!
[01:44:44.332 --> 01:44:45.353]  Chuck in New Jersey.
[01:44:45.393 --> 01:44:46.114]  Go ahead, Chuck.
[01:44:46.334 --> 01:44:48.415]  Well, you know why I think this is going on, Alex.
[01:44:48.475 --> 01:44:51.938]  I think it's all being set up for another terrorist attack over here.
[01:44:51.998 --> 01:44:52.418]  That's right.
[01:44:52.438 --> 01:44:53.539]  And see, we had to do it.
[01:44:53.599 --> 01:44:54.360]  See what you did.
[01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:55.181]  You held us back.
[01:44:55.221 --> 01:44:55.941]  We're torturing.
[01:44:56.141 --> 01:44:58.023]  We're arresting anybody that disagrees with the government.
[01:44:58.123 --> 01:44:58.563]  Shut up.
[01:44:58.763 --> 01:44:59.404]  Do as we say.
[01:44:59.424 --> 01:45:00.585]  We've got to be tough now.
[01:45:00.965 --> 01:45:02.326]  I mean, it just amazes me.
[01:45:02.366 --> 01:45:04.128]  I mean, you have this Rush Limbaugh guy.
[01:45:04.488 --> 01:45:07.390]  Why don't they yank this guy off the air for the statement he made?
[01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:09.632]  I mean, that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
[01:45:10.251 --> 01:45:11.232]  Well, it's the First Amendment.
[01:45:11.252 --> 01:45:12.434]  We've got to be careful about that.
[01:45:12.474 --> 01:45:17.900]  The neocons are calling for arresting people that show a picture of an Iraqi laughing with the soldier's boots.
[01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:21.384]  And that's distasteful, and I support the troops, but it's their right to post it.
[01:45:21.544 --> 01:45:25.749]  But don't worry, the New York Times editor isn't going to get arrested, as the neocons are calling for.
[01:45:26.309 --> 01:45:27.290]  We're going to be arrested.
[01:45:27.450 --> 01:45:29.373]  The real conservative is exposing them.
[01:45:30.333 --> 01:45:32.435]  I'll tell you what, since you brought it up, let me put you on hold.
[01:45:32.716 --> 01:45:37.299]  Go ahead and play the Limbaugh clip talking about what's happening in the prisons and stuff.
[01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:39.461]  Oh, they're just blowing off steam, having some fun.
[01:45:39.501 --> 01:45:40.142]  Go ahead and play it.
[01:45:41.291 --> 01:45:42.952]  What's psychologically wrong with that?
[01:45:43.392 --> 01:45:50.854]  It's not the axe so much, it was like a college fraternity prank to stack up naked... Exactly!
[01:45:50.894 --> 01:45:52.875]  Exactly my point!
[01:45:53.175 --> 01:46:04.019]  This is no different than what happens at the Skull and Bones initiation, and we're going to ruin people's lives over it, and we're going to hamper our military effort, and then we're going to really hammer them because they had a good time.
[01:46:07.151 --> 01:46:09.233]  These people are being fired at every day.
[01:46:09.313 --> 01:46:10.755]  I'm talking about the people having a good time.
[01:46:11.095 --> 01:46:13.537]  These people... You ever heard of emotional release?
[01:46:14.618 --> 01:46:16.560]  You ever heard of me to blow some steam off?
[01:46:17.381 --> 01:46:20.104]  And we have the whole transcript from CBS News, but forget them.
[01:46:20.124 --> 01:46:20.784]  You don't believe them.
[01:46:20.804 --> 01:46:21.445]  They're liberal.
[01:46:21.465 --> 01:46:22.826]  Oh, they're just the Psy-Ops chiefs.
[01:46:23.267 --> 01:46:23.667]  No, no, no.
[01:46:23.727 --> 01:46:24.248]  Forget that.
[01:46:25.001 --> 01:46:27.963]  We have, off his own website, he was so proud of it, he posted it.
[01:46:27.983 --> 01:46:31.706]  He goes on to talk about, you know, the naked prisoners on Dutton and doing all the stuff to them.
[01:46:31.986 --> 01:46:32.867]  Just having a good time.
[01:46:33.627 --> 01:46:36.329]  The Takumbu Report admits raping women.
[01:46:36.910 --> 01:46:39.792]  But stuff even worse, folks, is now coming out.
[01:46:40.092 --> 01:46:41.633]  Go ahead and finish up what you were saying, Chuck.
[01:46:41.973 --> 01:46:48.278]  Okay, but basically I was saying, you know, they ought to pull... every American ought to be asking for Rush Limbaugh to be taken off the air, I think.
[01:46:48.738 --> 01:46:54.320]  I mean, people raise cain with what Howard Stern done and with what this Lindblad guy is doing.
[01:46:54.380 --> 01:46:56.581]  I mean, that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of.
[01:46:56.621 --> 01:47:07.665]  Well, I will say it's more obscene than implying that torturing women and children is just blowing off steam and sicking police dogs on people and things I'm not going to mention again on the air, some of the other horrible stuff.
[01:47:10.089 --> 01:47:13.052]  I mean, that is more obscene than, you know, using some potty humor.
[01:47:13.072 --> 01:47:14.213]  I don't support Howard Stern either.
[01:47:14.233 --> 01:47:18.857]  The station's right to dump these shows, but I'm not calling for any government regulation.
[01:47:19.057 --> 01:47:20.538]  It's the government doing all of this.
[01:47:20.839 --> 01:47:21.059]  I know.
[01:47:21.079 --> 01:47:24.522]  They should dump his show right off the air and put you on the air.
[01:47:24.542 --> 01:47:25.483]  At least you tell the truth.
[01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:35.623]  Well, I'm not for the assault weapons ban or open borders, and I admit the CFR exists, and that urban warfare training is going on in four states right now, and Limbaugh says that doesn't exist.
[01:47:35.643 --> 01:47:36.183]  Thanks for the call.
[01:47:36.703 --> 01:47:39.944]  Even though his books were published by the Council on Foreign Relations imprint.
[01:47:40.944 --> 01:47:42.305]  But again, it doesn't exist.
[01:47:42.385 --> 01:47:48.766]  Skull and Bones didn't exist three months ago, but now it's no big deal, it's just like Skull and Bones, so... You know, the liberals had to win.
[01:47:48.806 --> 01:47:51.047]  They had to take over by acting like conservatives, and they've done it.
[01:47:52.348 --> 01:47:53.708]  Bunch of bloated chicken hawks.
[01:47:57.269 --> 01:48:00.412]  We'll go to more calls, and I've got some other news on Chemtrails I want to get into, too.
[01:48:00.432 --> 01:48:04.334]  The total free number to join us on air, it's always a good idea to give the number out, it's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:48:10.503 --> 01:48:10.903]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:48:10.923 --> 01:48:13.224]  We'll continue with just wide open calls.
[01:48:13.324 --> 01:48:23.928]  I'm going to go to your calls even faster, just interspersed with snippets of Keynesh over the next hour and 12 minutes that we have left in global transmission.
[01:48:24.088 --> 01:48:26.669]  It is 48 minutes and 30 seconds into the second hour.
[01:48:28.249 --> 01:48:32.651]  But before I go any further, the time has come, the time is now.
[01:48:33.991 --> 01:48:36.932]  Marvin K. Mooney, will you please order my videos now?
[01:48:37.772 --> 01:48:39.593]  Okay, that's a Dr. Seuss line, but the point is,
[01:48:40.336 --> 01:48:42.280]  It's now time to get my videos.
[01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:44.424]  It's now time to make copies of them.
[01:48:44.465 --> 01:48:45.507]  Buy another ECR.
[01:48:46.068 --> 01:48:47.210]  Make 10 copies of them.
[01:48:47.250 --> 01:48:48.292]  Take you 10 nights to do it.
[01:48:48.352 --> 01:48:49.555]  Cost you $10 for the tapes.
[01:48:50.362 --> 01:48:58.786]  You know, to buy blank copies, give them to police chiefs, county commissioners, talk show hosts, your pastors, 90% of people that will watch it.
[01:48:58.846 --> 01:49:00.106]  Some of them won't watch it.
[01:49:00.146 --> 01:49:05.769]  I've seen people act like I'm trying to hand them a cobra, you know, a 50-foot venomous cobra, when I try to give them a video.
[01:49:05.809 --> 01:49:11.251]  But if they don't watch it, 90% have their minds opened up, have their conditioning, their paradigm shifted.
[01:49:12.083 --> 01:49:12.964]  I've made 10 films.
[01:49:13.365 --> 01:49:17.530]  I carry other great videos by Jews and the Preservation of Firearms, Innocence Portrayed.
[01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:18.451]  You've got to get that video.
[01:49:19.191 --> 01:49:20.633]  I've got Tex Marr's videos.
[01:49:20.673 --> 01:49:21.975]  I've got Eric Huffman videos.
[01:49:22.375 --> 01:49:23.496]  I've got books on tape.
[01:49:23.637 --> 01:49:23.977]  Books.
[01:49:24.638 --> 01:49:25.158]  My books.
[01:49:25.259 --> 01:49:25.779]  Other books.
[01:49:26.540 --> 01:49:28.202]  But get 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:49:28.242 --> 01:49:29.143]  Get Masters of Terror.
[01:49:29.183 --> 01:49:30.705]  Get Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:31.285 --> 01:49:32.266]  Get Matrix of Evil.
[01:49:32.286 --> 01:49:34.247]  Get America Destroyed by Design.
[01:49:34.547 --> 01:49:36.188]  Get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:49:36.248 --> 01:49:37.149]  I made 10 films.
[01:49:37.169 --> 01:49:38.129]  They're all over 2 hours.
[01:49:38.389 --> 01:49:39.990]  Some are 2 hours 44 minutes long.
[01:49:40.010 --> 01:49:40.691]  Some are 2, 20, 2, 30.
[01:49:41.411 --> 01:49:42.572]  They're all over 2 hours, though.
[01:49:43.292 --> 01:49:44.553]  $25.95 apiece.
[01:49:45.333 --> 01:49:48.055]  $20 when you order them, my friends.
[01:49:48.075 --> 01:49:48.955]  3 or more.
[01:49:49.596 --> 01:49:49.956]  $20 apiece.
[01:49:49.996 --> 01:49:52.537]  That's an $18 discount on the 3-tape special.
[01:49:52.557 --> 01:49:54.739]  $24 discount on the 4-tape special.
[01:49:54.959 --> 01:49:56.880]  And it makes this broadcast possible.
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:49:59.421]  Please make the call today.
[01:49:59.701 --> 01:50:00.542]  We need your support.
[01:50:00.902 --> 01:50:01.262]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:01.282 --> 01:50:01.643]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:01.683 --> 01:50:03.624]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001.
[01:50:03.884 --> 01:50:07.767]  That's 3001 South Lamar, spelled L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:50:27.876 --> 01:50:28.897]  And again, that number to call.
[01:50:28.917 --> 01:50:29.437]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:29.457 --> 01:50:38.544]  If you want to order by mail, but you've got some questions, you can call that number and ask.
[01:50:38.704 --> 01:50:44.448]  Or, the internet's the best way to order, because there's all the video clips of the films, and descriptions of them, and all that.
[01:50:45.269 --> 01:50:47.691]  So, prisonplanet.tv or infowars.com to order.
[01:50:48.211 --> 01:50:52.594]  Alright, we'll be back with more news, more calls, then we'll start the third hour.
[01:50:52.674 --> 01:50:53.455]  Please stay with us.
[01:50:54.753 --> 01:50:57.694]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:50:58.354 --> 01:50:59.634]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:50:59.834 --> 01:51:05.576]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:51:05.856 --> 01:51:11.117]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:51:11.397 --> 01:51:15.558]  Brace yourselves, as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:51:15.738 --> 01:51:19.499]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:51:19.779 --> 01:51:24.400]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:30.742]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:51:30.782 --> 01:51:32.643]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:51:33.103 --> 01:51:35.184]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny today.
[01:51:35.264 --> 01:51:36.465]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:51:37.185 --> 01:51:40.206]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:51:41.146 --> 01:51:46.789]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[01:51:46.909 --> 01:51:48.909]  You see, Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[01:51:49.149 --> 01:51:50.650]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:51:50.830 --> 01:51:52.931]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:51:53.644 --> 01:51:55.605]  You've asked for them, and now they're here!
[01:51:55.705 --> 01:52:06.410]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:52:06.790 --> 01:52:11.312]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:52:11.372 --> 01:52:22.718]  When used, water flows through the purification elements, where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:52:23.298 --> 01:52:30.143]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:52:30.543 --> 01:52:32.684]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:52:33.185 --> 01:52:38.128]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:52:38.448 --> 01:52:44.757]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:52:44.837 --> 01:52:49.023]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:52:49.243 --> 01:52:50.004]  That's toll free.
[01:52:50.024 --> 01:52:50.064]  888-803-4438.
[01:52:55.296 --> 01:52:55.636]  I think so.
[01:53:10.541 --> 01:53:11.202]  We're good to go!
[01:53:40.060 --> 01:53:43.142]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:53:43.322 --> 01:53:49.345]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:53:59.471 --> 01:54:01.372]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:54:01.852 --> 01:54:04.694]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:54:06.675 --> 01:54:07.075]  British!
[01:54:08.408 --> 01:54:12.770]  Brought foreign German troops in here for our eight-year, nine-year war.
[01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:14.671]  The first war.
[01:54:14.711 --> 01:54:15.891]  They did it in the second war.
[01:54:18.212 --> 01:54:20.533]  And here is the Associated Press.
[01:54:20.613 --> 01:54:23.154]  Military attractive to illegals.
[01:54:23.234 --> 01:54:25.735]  Lawyers say hope of citizenship lures many into service.
[01:54:26.815 --> 01:54:35.779]  And there are over 30,000 foreigners who came here just to be in the military, and they say that number is now exploding.
[01:54:38.070 --> 01:54:40.211]  And a lot of them are, of course, from Mexico and other areas.
[01:54:40.251 --> 01:54:41.832]  I mean, that's just how this is all happening.
[01:54:42.192 --> 01:54:43.493]  It's right out in plain view.
[01:54:43.533 --> 01:54:44.933]  That's some of the news we'll be getting into.
[01:54:44.993 --> 01:54:49.756]  Also, this chemtrail story out of, of all places, Time Magazine.
[01:54:50.996 --> 01:54:52.157]  But let's continue with the calls.
[01:54:52.177 --> 01:54:57.999]  Your chance to respond during this major news event, this major military psyops program that we're in the middle of.
[01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:00.080]  Eric in Connecticut.
[01:55:00.661 --> 01:55:01.461]  Go ahead, Eric.
[01:55:02.061 --> 01:55:02.422]  Hi, Alex.
[01:55:02.482 --> 01:55:03.522]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:55:03.762 --> 01:55:04.062]  You bet.
[01:55:04.623 --> 01:55:05.243]  I'm convinced.
[01:55:06.067 --> 01:55:14.594]  In light of recent news that we are facing an evil so dark, so pervasive and malignant, that we will need to muster everything we have to defeat it.
[01:55:16.155 --> 01:55:17.797]  Chuck pretty much stole a lot of my thunder.
[01:55:17.877 --> 01:55:30.187]  I believe, as he does, that this staged execution, well, I mean the execution was real of course, but in all the particulars were a lie, is a setup for another attack in America.
[01:55:31.144 --> 01:55:36.447]  This way the neocons and the president and everybody else can come out and say, well, they wanted revenge.
[01:55:37.407 --> 01:55:38.668]  And that's why we were attacked.
[01:55:39.788 --> 01:55:51.374]  Even Limbaugh, he's still saying that the reason we were attacked on September 11th was because we were basically living too fat, too dumb, and too happy, and that we needed to be brought down a few pegs by our enemies.
[01:55:52.955 --> 01:55:59.578]  I used to be a subscriber to his newsletter and to his website and everything else, and then I got wise and I basically told him
[01:56:00.461 --> 01:56:01.942]  Well, it's a family program.
[01:56:01.962 --> 01:56:07.927]  I won't tell you what I told them, but I basically said, I'm not interested in you anymore because you're nothing but a big, fat liar.
[01:56:10.088 --> 01:56:14.171]  There's a great website that exposes Limbaugh.
[01:56:14.692 --> 01:56:17.634]  Actually, it's linked through WhatReallyHappened.com.
[01:56:17.654 --> 01:56:22.958]  Do a search, and it's a grassroots site to expose Limbaugh, and I think it appeared about two days ago.
[01:56:22.978 --> 01:56:25.340]  And Laura Ingram,
[01:56:26.215 --> 01:56:32.381]  He was talking about the beheading being the revenge for the attack on Jessica Lynch.
[01:56:33.462 --> 01:56:34.763]  And that just cinched it for me.
[01:56:36.725 --> 01:56:37.906]  Totally cinched it for me.
[01:56:38.812 --> 01:56:42.335]  These neocons are just Trojan horses in every conceivable way out.
[01:56:42.375 --> 01:56:53.383]  Yeah, I mean the Jessica Lynch thing was admittedly produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, BBC News reported, major producer, was all staged, she set it staged, and they're still saying they found weapons of mass destruction.
[01:56:53.644 --> 01:56:55.305]  These people are incredible.
[01:56:55.725 --> 01:56:57.246]  They are the big government pimps.
[01:56:57.567 --> 01:56:58.767]  They're all working together.
[01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:03.944]  In every way Alex, what we saw was a convenient human sacrifice by the globalists.
[01:57:25.670 --> 01:57:26.691]  That's right, that's right.
[01:57:26.751 --> 01:57:28.212]  A sacrifice for their system.
[01:57:29.713 --> 01:57:30.413]  I hear you, Eric.
[01:57:30.453 --> 01:57:31.233]  Thank you for the call.
[01:57:32.314 --> 01:57:36.076]  Let's go ahead and talk to Neil in Canada.
[01:57:36.156 --> 01:57:37.117]  Neil, go ahead.
[01:57:37.137 --> 01:57:38.177]  Hey, Alex.
[01:57:38.558 --> 01:57:39.098]  Hello, Neil.
[01:57:39.258 --> 01:57:40.799]  Two points about that video.
[01:57:41.259 --> 01:57:46.422]  First thing is, I don't know how gullible we could be to believe anything that's released off a website.
[01:57:46.442 --> 01:57:52.025]  Like, how do they evade us with websites when it's... Well, I mean, every time Bin Laden says something on a message board, look, it's Bin Laden!
[01:57:52.065 --> 01:57:52.726]  It's Bin Laden!
[01:57:53.317 --> 01:57:54.497]  Yeah, every time.
[01:57:54.577 --> 01:57:55.698]  It's like, how do you believe that?
[01:57:56.658 --> 01:58:00.239]  And it's not a news report on the site, it's just something released on the site.
[01:58:00.579 --> 01:58:04.281]  Yeah, and we're supposed to believe it like they can't track the IP or where it came from or nothing.
[01:58:05.261 --> 01:58:10.983]  And the second point is, on all the versions I've seen of this video, there's an edit just before they pull the head up.
[01:58:12.583 --> 01:58:13.664]  There's a splice in there.
[01:58:14.424 --> 01:58:15.464]  Oh, there's a lot of editing.
[01:58:15.664 --> 01:58:16.205]  Are you kidding?
[01:58:18.425 --> 01:58:18.965]  Anything else?
[01:58:19.406 --> 01:58:20.346]  I think you should post it.
[01:58:21.176 --> 01:58:22.257]  Oh, it's been posted.
[01:58:22.277 --> 01:58:23.817]  Because others are posting it.
[01:58:23.877 --> 01:58:27.459]  And we're going to put images up there of them killing Iraqis.
[01:58:27.499 --> 01:58:29.060]  We've put images of them beating them to death.
[01:58:29.440 --> 01:58:36.864]  They're dead bodies, so we're not going to... We're not going to let others post a video and then use it for their neocon aims either.
[01:58:36.884 --> 01:58:38.705]  We're going to expose these big government pimps.
[01:58:39.446 --> 01:58:42.549]  Alright, we'll be right back with a third hour global transmission against tyranny.
[01:58:42.769 --> 01:58:43.610]  We'll continue.
[01:58:44.330 --> 01:58:47.573]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:58:47.653 --> 01:58:51.797]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:58:52.077 --> 01:58:54.820]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:58:55.060 --> 01:58:57.421]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:58:57.641 --> 01:59:06.283]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:59:06.483 --> 01:59:07.823]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:59:08.023 --> 01:59:14.225]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path of the self-sterilizing filters.
[01:59:14.485 --> 01:59:20.506]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts,
[01:59:20.726 --> 01:59:24.767]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:59:24.827 --> 01:59:26.287]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:59:51.372 --> 01:59:51.993]  Big Brother.
[01:59:52.673 --> 01:59:53.714]  Mainstream Media.
[01:59:54.435 --> 01:59:55.535]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:56.196 --> 01:59:57.016]  You want answers?
[01:59:57.777 --> 01:59:58.658]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:58.678 --> 02:00:03.081]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:03.521 --> 02:00:07.644]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:12.607 --> 02:00:14.409]  Hour number three.
[02:00:14.449 --> 02:00:17.451]  We will get into the chemtrail news right out of Time Magazine.
[02:00:17.471 --> 02:00:18.912]  Yesterday I read that AP article.
[02:00:19.827 --> 02:00:20.607]  Out of Minnesota.
[02:00:22.068 --> 02:00:22.668]  Where'd they go?
[02:00:22.708 --> 02:00:27.871]  Yeah, NASA admits that the planes are putting out all this condensation now, and it's made the Earth 20% darker.
[02:00:28.331 --> 02:00:32.493]  Actually, the Goddard Space Center said that three months ago, but now here it is.
[02:00:32.553 --> 02:00:37.495]  And oh, things are darker, and they are forming at lower levels, but it's being studied.
[02:00:38.315 --> 02:00:45.538]  Children are now being taught in public schools to look up and accept that the skies are always going to be like this now, because of the planes, and they're explaining why that happens.
[02:00:45.858 --> 02:00:52.061]  But five, six years ago, a plane at 4,000 feet didn't leave ice crystals that hung there for five hours.
[02:00:52.101 --> 02:00:54.882]  At 35,000 feet, it stayed there for a few seconds, maximum a minute.
[02:00:55.243 --> 02:00:56.163]  What's going on here?
[02:00:57.774 --> 02:01:12.820]  And then at the same time, this Nick Berg individual, this poor person who had his head cut off, sawed off over about a twenty-second period, just nightmarish video, to say the least, he was in U.S.
[02:01:12.860 --> 02:01:17.922]  government custody, wouldn't let him leave the country, wouldn't let him call a lawyer, wouldn't let him talk to family.
[02:01:18.303 --> 02:01:23.925]  Then they release him, and in less than twenty-four hours, he's in Al-C-I-A, I mean Al-Qaeda hands,
[02:01:27.026 --> 02:01:32.771]  And he gets his head sawed off and then this gets released right on time to cover up all the other torture and stuff.
[02:01:33.352 --> 02:01:34.052]  It is obvious.
[02:01:34.092 --> 02:01:35.554]  We know Al Qaeda's CIA.
[02:01:36.014 --> 02:01:37.275]  We know they had him in custody.
[02:01:37.315 --> 02:01:39.237]  We know they gave him to Al Qaeda.
[02:01:39.437 --> 02:01:40.137]  This is obvious.
[02:01:40.178 --> 02:01:40.958]  It's a done deal.
[02:01:41.579 --> 02:01:48.585]  And now the guy with the saw knife, MSNBC reports back on March 4th that he was killed months ago
[02:01:50.094 --> 02:01:50.494]  Hello, Alex.
[02:02:15.956 --> 02:02:24.005]  To me, the proliferation of snuff pouring out of Iraq now is symptomatic of a country which has lost its way.
[02:02:24.585 --> 02:02:35.838]  And if a person is not technically adept at analyzing a work for authenticity, interpreting it for propaganda,
[02:02:37.492 --> 02:02:42.835]  Interpreting it for editing and tampering, then we have no business viewing this material.
[02:02:43.435 --> 02:02:45.877]  It's unfortunate that you put it up on your site.
[02:02:46.357 --> 02:02:50.359]  Well, I'd say about 75% of the people have brought up good points to put it up.
[02:02:50.379 --> 02:02:51.640]  You're bringing up an interesting point.
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.761]  One of the reasons we considered not doing it, but now it's going to be shown everywhere.
[02:02:54.781 --> 02:02:57.063]  It's being shown now all over the place, sir.
[02:02:57.663 --> 02:03:02.245]  And now people will go see it on sites that add their New World Order propaganda to it.
[02:03:02.546 --> 02:03:06.808]  So if that's going to happen with the evidence, we've got to present it with the facts and what the family
[02:03:07.468 --> 02:03:08.269]  Uh, is saying.
[02:03:08.869 --> 02:03:12.031]  And, uh, looking at it, it could easily be fake, though I don't think it is.
[02:03:12.051 --> 02:03:13.172]  They just snuffed this guy.
[02:03:13.872 --> 02:03:16.954]  And, uh, so, now you understand my point?
[02:03:17.074 --> 02:03:17.714]  I have, yes.
[02:03:18.135 --> 02:03:19.315]  I have good news for you.
[02:03:19.395 --> 02:03:24.118]  I'm, uh, going out today to purchase 10, 12, maybe 14 of your films.
[02:03:24.679 --> 02:03:24.999]  Thank you.
[02:03:25.559 --> 02:03:26.400]  Hey, I appreciate that.
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:27.020]  God bless you.
[02:03:27.180 --> 02:03:28.501]  And, uh, and good point you raised.
[02:03:28.521 --> 02:03:29.862]  That's the reason we almost didn't do it.
[02:03:29.882 --> 02:03:33.304]  But, if they're gonna put it out everywhere else, some good sites, some bad sites, whatever,
[02:03:34.225 --> 02:03:40.770]  And the government's going to put their spin on it and do this, then we have to be able to counter that.
[02:03:41.791 --> 02:03:48.817]  And the straw that broke the camel's back with me was Paul saying, look, are you going to post a video of them killing people?
[02:03:49.137 --> 02:03:50.879]  Well, we already have of the people beaten to death.
[02:03:51.159 --> 02:03:51.739]  And I said, yes.
[02:03:51.759 --> 02:03:52.220]  He said, well.
[02:03:53.341 --> 02:03:54.161]  So we did post it.
[02:03:54.301 --> 02:03:56.223]  And it's on the website.
[02:03:56.944 --> 02:03:58.645]  PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[02:03:58.665 --> 02:03:59.846]  And it's on other sites now, too.
[02:04:00.896 --> 02:04:02.958]  I mean, we see all the stuff on television every day.
[02:04:02.998 --> 02:04:07.221]  We see the piles of dead Jews being pushed into the mass graves.
[02:04:07.941 --> 02:04:11.884]  We see the people, the Nazis, blowing women and children's heads off.
[02:04:12.104 --> 02:04:13.485]  You've all seen that black and white footage.
[02:04:13.545 --> 02:04:15.387]  Up close, their heads splattering!
[02:04:16.347 --> 02:04:18.349]  So, I mean, I understand your point, sir.
[02:04:18.709 --> 02:04:23.913]  But if they're going to use it as propaganda, we need to post it and put the facts up there of what the government admits.
[02:04:23.993 --> 02:04:24.533]  They had him.
[02:04:24.793 --> 02:04:26.695]  They released him right into Al-Qaeda hands.
[02:04:26.995 --> 02:04:27.635]  This happens.
[02:04:28.136 --> 02:04:29.817]  That's why I'm sure of what I did.
[02:04:30.669 --> 02:04:31.791]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:04:33.554 --> 02:04:43.951]  Okay, we'll come back and we'll go to Chris in North Carolina, Johnny Hawaii, Ken Fort Worth, and others in Illinois.
[02:04:43.991 --> 02:04:44.412]  You name it.
[02:04:44.452 --> 02:04:44.852]  Stay with us.
[02:04:46.391 --> 02:04:49.375]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:04:49.736 --> 02:04:58.568]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:04:58.888 --> 02:05:03.555]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:05:04.015 --> 02:05:10.737]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:05:11.137 --> 02:05:22.920]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:27.865]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:05:28.025 --> 02:05:30.368]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:05:45.174 --> 02:05:47.961]  What kind of gift can you give to someone who has everything?
[02:05:48.362 --> 02:05:49.465]  Are you running out of ideas?
[02:05:49.926 --> 02:05:50.548]  Out of time?
[02:05:51.029 --> 02:05:54.197]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?
[02:05:54.881 --> 02:05:57.743]  Well, think of a song, written especially for them.
[02:05:58.023 --> 02:06:05.970]  And all you have to do is go to www.songsforever.com and provide us all the information about that special someone.
[02:06:06.390 --> 02:06:09.693]  Interesting facts, unique things about him, and all you can think of.
[02:06:10.033 --> 02:06:18.039]  Songsforever.com will use that information brought to us by you to compose a unique song with original lyrics inspired by everything you've told us.
[02:06:18.619 --> 02:06:19.120]  Just listen.
[02:06:27.144 --> 02:06:32.666]  Birthday coming soon?
[02:06:33.066 --> 02:06:33.766]  Anniversary?
[02:06:34.267 --> 02:06:34.987]  Wedding perhaps?
[02:06:35.587 --> 02:06:36.527]  Mother's Day's coming up?
[02:06:37.088 --> 02:06:41.049]  Just go to www.songsforever.com.
[02:06:41.509 --> 02:06:43.810]  That's www.songsforever.com.
[02:06:45.905 --> 02:06:51.970]  Most so-called tax shelters try to show you how to reduce your taxes, but they still insist that you must pay taxes.
[02:06:52.330 --> 02:06:58.595]  And they require that you do goofy, bizarre things with your money that you'd never normally do just so you can save a few bucks.
[02:06:59.276 --> 02:07:00.377]  Not this tax shelter!
[02:07:00.817 --> 02:07:09.324]  It's so complete, it's so superior, that it will teach you how to properly comply with the tax laws and still end up with zero tax liability.
[02:07:09.604 --> 02:07:10.085]  Imagine!
[02:07:10.385 --> 02:07:13.628]  You find out that you've been deceived about what the tax laws require
[02:07:14.188 --> 02:07:17.131]  And you learn how to obey them better than you ever have before.
[02:07:17.311 --> 02:07:19.833]  And as a result, you end up owing the government nothing.
[02:07:20.253 --> 02:07:23.596]  You get to keep every single dime of your hard-earned money.
[02:07:23.996 --> 02:07:24.677]  Sound amazing?
[02:07:25.117 --> 02:07:26.198]  Sound too good to be true?
[02:07:26.739 --> 02:07:27.739]  Find out for yourself.

[02:07:42.231 --> 02:07:42.792]  Visit today.
[02:07:47.719 --> 02:07:53.745]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:07:54.365 --> 02:07:57.408]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:00.451 --> 02:08:05.195]  You know, the neocons are all over talk radio saying they want the video posted.
[02:08:06.255 --> 02:08:08.217]  So they can use it for propaganda purposes.
[02:08:08.257 --> 02:08:15.605]  Well, we posted it at PrisonPlanet.tv along with the still images so people know the truth.
[02:08:15.645 --> 02:08:19.089]  So they can read the facts, what the family has said, what the government admits.
[02:08:19.129 --> 02:08:22.813]  That they grabbed him, they held him, wouldn't let him talk to anybody, released him.
[02:08:23.214 --> 02:08:26.197]  In less than 24 hours he was in Al-Cieda.
[02:08:27.205 --> 02:08:38.754]  C-I-A-R-I-B-A control and this is disgusting and they should bring those accountable to justice just like the guards raping and killing women and children should be brought to justice as well.
[02:08:38.834 --> 02:08:40.135]  Families grabbed up at checkpoints.
[02:08:40.215 --> 02:08:41.035]  Army's own document.
[02:08:41.556 --> 02:08:44.078]  Seventy to ninety percent totally innocent of doing anything.
[02:08:44.438 --> 02:08:46.680]  But you sickos out there say torture them, kill them.
[02:08:47.100 --> 02:08:49.322]  But then it's bad when our people get tortured and killed.
[02:08:49.362 --> 02:08:50.963]  It's bad when this happens to anybody!
[02:08:53.047 --> 02:08:54.468]  All right, let's go back to your calls.
[02:08:54.548 --> 02:08:59.290]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in North Carolina.
[02:08:59.350 --> 02:09:00.691]  Chris, you're on the air globally.
[02:09:01.192 --> 02:09:01.732]  Hello, Alex.
[02:09:02.072 --> 02:09:02.812]  Good to speak with you.
[02:09:02.912 --> 02:09:03.573]  Good to talk to you.
[02:09:04.553 --> 02:09:06.835]  Just wanted to make a comment on your posting of the video.
[02:09:07.215 --> 02:09:16.640]  I understand everything, and your reasoning behind it, but I'm just wondering if just posting the audio would have enough effect on people.
[02:09:18.470 --> 02:09:29.397]  Well, I mean, it's so blurry anyways that you really don't... I mean, they've already posted image by image on the Drugs Report, which is actually even more graphic, the head being cut off and the head being held up.
[02:09:30.097 --> 02:09:32.038]  Okay, so they've done still images of it.
[02:09:32.078 --> 02:09:39.283]  It's basically, the video's already out there on the news and the main big websites and the newspapers, okay, and now the video's proliferating all over the place.
[02:09:40.143 --> 02:09:47.448]  Well, I mean, overall, people just really need to understand that, you know, eventually, you know, this is going to be happening everywhere and, you know,
[02:09:48.377 --> 02:09:52.421]  Hearing this fella having his life is very exposed from his body.
[02:09:55.203 --> 02:09:57.726]  They're just waiting to have this happen over here in America.
[02:09:57.766 --> 02:10:02.850]  You know, we could download it and play it, and I know the news has been doing that.
[02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:05.893]  I've heard some clips of it on the news, so we're not breaking any ground.
[02:10:05.933 --> 02:10:08.716]  I wonder, do you think we ought to air that audio here?
[02:10:09.372 --> 02:10:13.394]  Well, at least post it, I guess, maybe for the squeamish out there.
[02:10:14.554 --> 02:10:16.755]  Just the audio, you'll hear him screaming when they cut his head off.
[02:10:16.995 --> 02:10:18.716]  I don't know, I've got to think about that.
[02:10:20.257 --> 02:10:20.777]  I've heard them.
[02:10:20.837 --> 02:10:23.538]  I've heard like ABC News and stuff have been airing some of it.
[02:10:23.578 --> 02:10:24.118]  Really?
[02:10:24.658 --> 02:10:26.839]  Yeah, when you talk about that, that's an idea.
[02:10:26.959 --> 02:10:27.840]  I don't particularly.
[02:10:30.274 --> 02:10:33.855]  I watched it three times looking for detail, and I should probably watch it more.
[02:10:33.875 --> 02:10:35.296]  I just can't stand watching it.
[02:10:36.056 --> 02:10:36.796]  I agree with you.
[02:10:37.316 --> 02:10:38.717]  All right, well, anything else, sir?
[02:10:39.697 --> 02:10:41.298]  A comment about your chemtrails.
[02:10:41.858 --> 02:10:48.000]  Here in eastern North Carolina, there's not a morning I get up that at least three days a week they're laying at least 20 lines.
[02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:51.441]  But five, six years ago you didn't have that, and the trails disappeared in seconds.
[02:10:51.781 --> 02:10:55.282]  Do they sit there for four or five hours at 5,000 feet like they do here?
[02:10:55.682 --> 02:10:56.162]  Oh, no, no.
[02:10:56.182 --> 02:10:59.203]  I'm well aware of the atmospheric conditions that need to happen with that.
[02:10:59.663 --> 02:11:03.988]  I remember seeing these things back in 97, where most places are reporting 98.
[02:11:04.969 --> 02:11:06.450]  That was over Raleigh, North Carolina.
[02:11:08.621 --> 02:11:10.342]  Yeah, something's got to be done about it.
[02:11:11.382 --> 02:11:16.184]  Well, now they're going to have a federally funded national education in the schools to teach the children.
[02:11:16.224 --> 02:11:17.004]  It's all normal.
[02:11:17.464 --> 02:11:28.748]  Just like swiping your card is normal, and thumb scanning to get lunch is normal, and being frisked by police is normal, and bar bar fits is going up is normal, and your parents not being able to pick you up is normal, and oh, part of your schooling now.
[02:11:29.048 --> 02:11:30.369]  This is the way America is.
[02:11:30.649 --> 02:11:32.950]  We have satellite photos of the whole country covered with these.
[02:11:32.970 --> 02:11:35.771]  You can't even see the outlines of the states anymore, thanks for the call.
[02:11:37.458 --> 02:11:38.559]  Just amazing!
[02:11:38.719 --> 02:11:39.619]  It's incredible!
[02:11:40.540 --> 02:11:43.462]  Let's go ahead and talk to Johnny in Hawaii.
[02:11:43.562 --> 02:11:44.423]  Johnny, go ahead.
[02:11:44.443 --> 02:11:45.483]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:11:46.364 --> 02:11:50.487]  I think it's a good idea to post a video that will be hitting your website.
[02:11:51.641 --> 02:12:00.987]  Yeah, if you have all the articles you have on your Infowars.com site explaining everything that happened in the timeline, showing how the Goblas have used this to their advantage.
[02:12:01.167 --> 02:12:03.208]  Yeah, we need to add the info from MSNBC.
[02:12:03.229 --> 02:12:05.890]  The guy cutting his head off was dead at least three months ago.
[02:12:05.930 --> 02:12:10.013]  We need to add the information to it, to the site.
[02:12:10.733 --> 02:12:14.936]  Well, we've got it, you know, where the family says, you know, you had him in custody, the government admitting that.
[02:12:15.917 --> 02:12:17.818]  That basically is already there.
[02:12:18.573 --> 02:12:19.293]  Yeah, okay.
[02:12:19.493 --> 02:12:21.254]  Yeah, on your Prison Planet TV site, though.
[02:12:21.735 --> 02:12:24.156]  Before the video was shown, and then... Yes, it was there.
[02:12:24.436 --> 02:12:24.736]  It is there.
[02:12:24.756 --> 02:12:27.758]  Okay, I haven't looked at it yet, but yeah, I'm a member, too, but I've got to go look at it now.
[02:12:27.778 --> 02:12:28.478]  Well, thank you, sir.
[02:12:28.618 --> 02:12:29.238]  Oh, you're welcome.
[02:12:29.678 --> 02:12:43.365]  But, yeah, please just keep up the good work, and keep laying this stuff out for everybody, because I didn't realize until you explained this, and I read your site, how the Globes have used this, again, to their advantage, but it's explained as clear as a bell.
[02:12:43.745 --> 02:12:44.886]  It all makes perfect sense.
[02:12:45.946 --> 02:12:46.467]  Well, thank you.
[02:12:46.507 --> 02:12:46.987]  Anything else?
[02:12:48.343 --> 02:12:56.991]  Well, one thing here in Hawaii, we're going to have to pay a 66% charge for cell phone usage so they'll be able to track us.
[02:12:57.551 --> 02:12:58.872]  I do equipment so they can track us.
[02:12:59.193 --> 02:13:09.242]  Now, so it said in your newspaper, I'm just going from the Green Bay and Wisconsin newspaper last year, this is in Matrix of Evil, the article, and my analysis of it in that film,
[02:13:10.232 --> 02:13:12.815]  But the governor said, oh, we're going to have a sales tax tax.
[02:13:13.316 --> 02:13:17.800]  All our emergency centers can already track you down to 15 feet from where your phone is.
[02:13:18.841 --> 02:13:24.267]  And so we're going to have a tax to do that, to pay for it, to monitor you in real time.
[02:13:24.587 --> 02:13:25.909]  Is that what your local paper said?
[02:13:26.129 --> 02:13:26.730]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:13:26.810 --> 02:13:30.494]  And those they chose the 66 cents, which is unique numbers.
[02:13:31.605 --> 02:13:32.926]  Is that $0.56 a month?
[02:13:33.266 --> 02:13:33.446]  Yes.
[02:13:33.666 --> 02:13:36.007]  To pay for people to track and watch you as you drive around?
[02:13:36.187 --> 02:13:36.707]  Exactly.
[02:13:38.168 --> 02:13:39.028]  Where did you hear this?
[02:13:39.048 --> 02:13:41.229]  Because I want the article to add that to the website.
[02:13:41.629 --> 02:13:42.289]  I can email it to you.
[02:13:42.309 --> 02:13:44.430]  It's off of Hulu Advertiser, which is online.
[02:13:45.251 --> 02:13:54.334]  All the same Hollywood advertisers, seven days before, said the Japanese are to attack on the very date they did attack.
[02:13:54.634 --> 02:13:55.614]  Yeah, it's the same newspaper.
[02:13:55.654 --> 02:13:57.835]  That's funny, I have that original article.
[02:13:57.855 --> 02:14:01.756]  Yeah, it's that one in the Hollywood Star Bulletin or the two papers here.
[02:14:01.856 --> 02:14:10.079]  Yeah, I need to get that Green Bay article again and then post this new article with it because, again, October 1st, 2001, they passed a law five years before.
[02:14:11.059 --> 02:14:13.059]  All cell phones track you now.
[02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:14.200]  It is disgusting.
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:14.760]  Thanks for the call.
[02:14:15.945 --> 02:14:22.446]  That's your freedom, and now they're going to use a tax to make you pay for it to be tracked to have an actual person watching you as you drive around.
[02:14:23.767 --> 02:14:28.328]  Oh, and the Governor bragged that we can tune in via the audio and listen to you, too!
[02:14:29.928 --> 02:14:32.989]  How great it was in Wisconsin, so now moving to Hawaii.
[02:14:34.229 --> 02:14:35.729]  Aloha, big brother!
[02:14:37.150 --> 02:14:40.430]  Let's go ahead, and who is up next here?
[02:14:41.550 --> 02:14:42.771]  Jaycia in Illinois.
[02:14:42.891 --> 02:14:43.791]  Jaycia, welcome!
[02:14:45.383 --> 02:14:49.125]  Well, I am speaking on my cell phone, so... That sounds good and clear.
[02:14:49.145 --> 02:14:49.565]  Go ahead.
[02:14:50.205 --> 02:14:51.646]  Well, I'm on Yahoo.
[02:14:51.686 --> 02:14:58.770]  I was looking up some stuff on Kim Trails, and I look on the, you know, the news bulletin, and the second to the top story says, U.S.
[02:14:58.810 --> 02:15:01.031]  Denies Holding Beheading Victim.
[02:15:01.491 --> 02:15:03.052]  Federer was never in U.S.
[02:15:03.132 --> 02:15:07.194]  custody despite claims from his family, a coalition spokesman said Wednesday.
[02:15:07.234 --> 02:15:09.655]  This was posted 33 minutes ago on Yahoo.
[02:15:09.915 --> 02:15:21.840]  Funny, yesterday they admitted they'd held him, but just said it was for his safety, and the top general, I got the article right here, quote, advised him to leave when they released him, hours later grabbed by LCIA.
[02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:24.241]  So now they're changing their story, hmm?
[02:15:24.981 --> 02:15:25.922]  It's unbelievable.
[02:15:25.942 --> 02:15:28.763]  The very next day, like, how stupid are we?
[02:15:29.283 --> 02:15:35.446]  If this even goes through, if people go ahead and forget about it like they kind of are with 9-11, I'm gonna freak out, because
[02:15:37.027 --> 02:15:39.150]  This is really the last straw.
[02:15:39.170 --> 02:15:43.093]  If people don't take any action after this, I don't know what it's going to take.
[02:15:43.594 --> 02:15:45.235]  Yeah, they grab him, they hold him.
[02:15:45.275 --> 02:15:46.797]  Don't let him call family or anybody.
[02:15:47.257 --> 02:15:50.481]  He gets out, tells them I was just grabbed by the feds.
[02:15:50.521 --> 02:15:51.482]  He calls them and tells them.
[02:15:51.682 --> 02:15:53.043]  They admit this to him.
[02:15:53.463 --> 02:15:56.526]  Then the general comes up and says, well we released him and told him to get out of the country.
[02:15:56.747 --> 02:15:57.948]  And now they're denying it?
[02:15:59.167 --> 02:16:03.651]  Oh, absolutely, and actually when you click on the story it says there's a link for a video excerpt.
[02:16:03.691 --> 02:16:09.815]  Now I'm at work and I can't watch video online here, so I don't know if it actually has a link to the real video.
[02:16:09.835 --> 02:16:12.858]  No, no, what the mainstream news is they show edited video.
[02:16:13.398 --> 02:16:16.060]  Yeah, it says, caution, content may be disturbing.
[02:16:16.400 --> 02:16:20.684]  When is there a line between maybe and is, capital I-S, disturbing?
[02:16:21.204 --> 02:16:26.908]  And then on another note, also on Kim Trails, I sent you an email recently with a bunch of pictures.
[02:16:26.968 --> 02:16:44.081]  I was driving through Iowa over a four-hour period Wednesday, May 5th, last week, and they were constantly spraying all day for a four-hour period, driving into Des Moines, all the way through out of Davenport, which of course is the Rock Island Arsenal, the largest arsenal in the world.
[02:16:44.799 --> 02:16:55.853]  Um, but they were spraying all day long and I took many, many pictures and I have done some research about that and I just wanted to, you know, let some people know about a couple websites that I've come across with a lot of extensive information.
[02:16:56.454 --> 02:17:00.479]  Um, chemtrailcentral.com is a good one and also carnacom.com.
[02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:08.867]  Yeah, and also on InfoWars.com we have the article yesterday where NASA admits, oh, suddenly all these trails aren't.
[02:17:09.167 --> 02:17:11.369]  Suddenly ice crystals form at 4,000 feet.
[02:17:11.609 --> 02:17:13.311]  They never did before, but now they do.
[02:17:13.351 --> 02:17:19.697]  And Time Magazine, there's a program to teach the school children that all of this is normal, so they know their parents are crazy.
[02:17:21.101 --> 02:17:22.042]  Oh, you know, absolutely.
[02:17:22.122 --> 02:17:37.593]  And actually, NASA's website, they have a satellite photo of a bunch of chemtrails, which I'll forward to you, a bunch of chemtrails, and it even says on their own site, this has been, this normal emissions from Jetstream has been linked from 1947 to 1988 or something for 0.5%
[02:17:42.757 --> 02:17:45.359]  0.5 degree increase in temperature.
[02:17:45.399 --> 02:17:48.281]  It does increase global warming.
[02:17:48.401 --> 02:17:54.566]  And Goddard Space Center said a couple months ago, three months ago, that the Earth is 20% darker now.
[02:17:54.646 --> 02:17:55.326]  Thanks for the call.
[02:17:55.907 --> 02:17:56.767]  Amazing points.
[02:17:57.528 --> 02:17:58.328]  Good to hear from you.
[02:17:59.009 --> 02:18:00.530]  Robert in Texas.
[02:18:00.610 --> 02:18:01.451]  Robert, go ahead.
[02:18:01.731 --> 02:18:02.231]  Hey, Alex.
[02:18:02.271 --> 02:18:02.812]  How you doing?
[02:18:02.992 --> 02:18:03.873]  Fine, sir.
[02:18:04.013 --> 02:18:06.134]  I just want to make a comment about the chemtrails.
[02:18:06.355 --> 02:18:09.317]  It's been going on here in our hometown here in Austin.
[02:18:10.450 --> 02:18:24.487]  I've never seen so much gray skies and rain in the spring in Austin and you know how the weather is normally here it's normally clear blue skies maybe with a few clouds and high humidity but I've never seen such grayness and I took pictures about two weeks ago
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:28.762]  They were spraying as I was heading out 183 north towards Cedar Park.
[02:18:29.062 --> 02:18:35.245]  They were just laying them so thick and I took several pictures and I live in central, north central Austin, just north of Hyde Park.
[02:18:35.305 --> 02:18:36.025]  Let me say it again.
[02:18:36.125 --> 02:18:41.508]  Jets don't fly in hot weather at 4,000 feet and leave giant trails that stay there for 45 hours.
[02:18:41.608 --> 02:18:42.068]  Absolutely.
[02:18:42.508 --> 02:18:43.909]  What is going on?
[02:18:44.189 --> 02:18:47.571]  Why are they teaching school children this important federal program?
[02:18:47.611 --> 02:18:48.391]  This is normal.
[02:18:48.431 --> 02:18:50.292]  This is supposed to look like this.
[02:18:50.672 --> 02:18:54.036]  It's just bizarre, but I took pictures between about 9.30 a.m.
[02:18:54.056 --> 02:18:57.000]  and about 11 a.m., and they were streaks.
[02:18:57.040 --> 02:19:00.384]  And then I came back, and it was a totally clear blue day on April 28th.
[02:19:00.844 --> 02:19:08.253]  And back about 7 p.m., I took the pictures over my house, and they had spread into those white, wispy, thin patterns.
[02:19:08.715 --> 02:19:11.758]  And created this cloud cover by the end of the day.
[02:19:12.299 --> 02:19:22.028]  I've been sitting there where there's a perfect hash mark from a blue sky to two hours later, whole sky covered from 5,000 feet up to 40,000 feet.
[02:19:22.248 --> 02:19:27.473]  And just real quick, I want to tell you another real good... And there'll be jets flying, hold on a second, I'll let you hold over, just put them on hold.
[02:19:27.793 --> 02:19:32.878]  There'll be jets flying with one spring and then the one right by it, nothing coming out.
[02:19:33.917 --> 02:19:40.840]  Or there'll be a jet at 5,000, 6,000 feet, with a jet at 30,000 feet leaving no trail, with the low jet leaving a trail that stays there for two hours.
[02:19:42.740 --> 02:19:43.941]  What is going on?
[02:19:43.981 --> 02:19:44.741]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:45.961 --> 02:19:48.822]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:19:49.183 --> 02:19:52.044]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:19:52.284 --> 02:19:58.486]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[02:19:58.846 --> 02:20:06.169]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[02:20:06.349 --> 02:20:10.471]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[02:20:10.731 --> 02:20:16.254]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[02:20:16.474 --> 02:20:25.358]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps
[02:20:25.538 --> 02:20:26.078]  We're good to go!
[02:20:45.157 --> 02:20:47.238]  Cool weather brings cool cars!
[02:20:47.638 --> 02:20:48.558]  I don't think so.
[02:20:48.878 --> 02:20:52.499]  A cooling system can run too hot or too cold if not prepared for winter.
[02:20:52.880 --> 02:20:53.880]  Here's your to-do.
[02:20:54.120 --> 02:20:56.881]  Ask your local shop to perform the BG Coolant Flush.
[02:20:57.081 --> 02:21:02.723]  A simple test strip tells if your coolant's protecting the engine from temperature extremes or breaking down and corroding.
[02:21:03.083 --> 02:21:07.244]  The BG Chemistry cleans the system, then adds new coolant with conditioners.
[02:21:07.485 --> 02:21:12.306]  Ask your shop for a BG Coolant Flush or go to bgfindashop.com.
[02:21:12.546 --> 02:21:14.247]  That's bgfindashop.com.
[02:21:15.265 --> 02:21:18.867]  Want to know the secret to finding a shop that can keep your car running like new?
[02:21:19.048 --> 02:21:22.930]  Find the cleanest shop in town, where cleaning is top priority.
[02:21:23.110 --> 02:21:26.632]  Not talking about clean floors, but better shops have those too.
[02:21:26.993 --> 02:21:34.577]  I mean shops that have the best training, equipment, and chemistry to clean every air, fuel, and fluid system in your vehicle.
[02:21:34.858 --> 02:21:38.140]  Keep it clean, and you don't have to keep replacing parts.
[02:21:38.560 --> 02:21:42.222]  Find your clean shop at bgfindashop.com.
[02:21:42.462 --> 02:21:44.284]  That's bgfindashop.com.
[02:21:46.514 --> 02:21:49.678]  Hi, this is Jack Brauner with a gold alert from Midas Resources.
[02:21:50.098 --> 02:21:52.120]  Folks, it's time to shed your complacency.
[02:21:52.481 --> 02:21:55.063]  Gold has seldom, if ever, been a better buy.
[02:21:55.424 --> 02:21:59.989]  Midas Resources is now in a position to potentially show you considerable profits.
[02:22:00.209 --> 02:22:02.011]  But you have to act now!
[02:22:02.171 --> 02:22:08.298]  We have $10 collector gold coins at the closest price to melt I've seen in my 24 years in the business.
[02:22:08.740 --> 02:22:15.265]  These are the same coins that are likely to soon command substantial premium prices as they have in the past.
[02:22:15.505 --> 02:22:19.048]  We can deliver them to you now with minimal downside risk.
[02:22:19.288 --> 02:22:22.750]  Or we can let you buy them later at a considerable higher price.
[02:22:23.171 --> 02:22:25.452]  Don't buy them later, folks.
[02:22:25.813 --> 02:22:26.633]  Do it now.
[02:22:26.893 --> 02:22:29.115]  That's $10 collector gold coins.
[02:22:29.495 --> 02:22:36.260]  $10 and $20 collector gold coins at the nearest amount in my 24 years in this business called Midas Resources.
[02:22:45.345 --> 02:22:46.886]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:22:47.026 --> 02:22:48.187]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:22:48.348 --> 02:22:51.771]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:22:51.871 --> 02:22:52.331]  Phenol!
[02:22:52.612 --> 02:22:59.699]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:23:00.239 --> 02:23:04.122]  The FDA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:23:04.243 --> 02:23:04.683]  Fragrance?
[02:23:05.063 --> 02:23:09.827]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:23:09.947 --> 02:23:14.631]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[02:23:14.872 --> 02:23:17.354]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Calden shampoo.
[02:23:17.674 --> 02:23:21.076]  Well, like all of the products from the Kalben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:23:21.236 --> 02:23:24.797]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:23:24.978 --> 02:23:27.359]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:23:27.499 --> 02:23:28.379]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:23:28.499 --> 02:23:38.264]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Kalben Pure Soaps.
[02:23:38.444 --> 02:23:40.945]  Call Kalben toll free 1-800-340-7091 or visit KalbenPureSoap.com.
[02:23:49.153 --> 02:23:55.197]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:23:55.798 --> 02:23:58.800]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:01.222 --> 02:24:05.044]  That's right, my friends, Alex Jones here, back live.
[02:24:06.345 --> 02:24:07.866]  Mr. Nick Berg was in U.S.
[02:24:07.886 --> 02:24:08.867]  government custody.
[02:24:11.047 --> 02:24:13.149]  For 13 and a half days, that is admitted.
[02:24:13.189 --> 02:24:14.490]  They told his family that.
[02:24:14.770 --> 02:24:17.932]  The Pentagon said, oh, we'll release him and advise him to get out of Iraq.
[02:24:17.992 --> 02:24:19.453]  Now we're trying to say, no, no, no.
[02:24:19.894 --> 02:24:21.154]  He was never in our custody.
[02:24:21.174 --> 02:24:24.277]  We're catching him in a big lie, that lady, what she was saying was true earlier.
[02:24:24.857 --> 02:24:27.019]  Do a web search on that, guys, for me.
[02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:31.362]  Say something like, Pentagon denies that Berg was in custody.
[02:24:31.862 --> 02:24:35.065]  We can get that and compare all the generals contradicting each other.
[02:24:36.025 --> 02:24:36.606]  Oh, yeah.
[02:24:36.706 --> 02:24:38.287]  Yeah, that's a big slip-up for you, isn't it?
[02:24:39.293 --> 02:24:42.077]  Let's go ahead and take more calls.
[02:24:42.177 --> 02:24:46.723]  It's very important to let you get your info out and all the angles that the listeners bring up.
[02:24:46.743 --> 02:24:49.026]  I'm going to come back and get into some more of the news and the chemtrails.
[02:24:49.807 --> 02:24:51.549]  Right now, let's go ahead and
[02:24:54.190 --> 02:24:56.632]  We're talking to Robert in Texas trying to finish up a point.
[02:24:56.912 --> 02:24:57.553]  Go ahead, Robert.
[02:24:57.833 --> 02:24:58.694]  Hey, Alex.
[02:24:58.834 --> 02:25:09.183]  And it's funny what you mentioned about what I like to call the decoy jet that's leaving an actual contrail, which actually dissipates at a constant distance behind the jet.
[02:25:09.243 --> 02:25:10.224]  I've noticed that, too.
[02:25:10.504 --> 02:25:15.008]  And I think that's just like I said, a decoy or a distractor, so that when you say, hey, look there,
[02:25:15.413 --> 02:25:19.616]  Laying these channels, I go, no, look, that thing's dissipating, you know, as it follows behind another jet.
[02:25:19.656 --> 02:25:21.177]  I think it's just a distractor.
[02:25:21.478 --> 02:25:28.143]  Well, more than that, is that you'll have commercial jets flying around, not leaving these trails that stay there, and there's these weird white jets flying around that are doing it.
[02:25:28.443 --> 02:25:29.063]  Right, right.
[02:25:29.103 --> 02:25:29.904]  Hey, listen, gotta let you go.
[02:25:29.944 --> 02:25:30.644]  Good to hear from you.
[02:25:30.684 --> 02:25:33.547]  Hey, I got real quick one website I found that's real good.
[02:25:33.607 --> 02:25:36.929]  It's called bariumblues.com, and it mentions a lot of this.
[02:25:37.069 --> 02:25:38.070]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[02:25:38.090 --> 02:25:39.531]  Yeah, the barium salts and the sprays.
[02:25:41.152 --> 02:25:43.894]  Let's go ahead and talk to Victor in North Carolina.
[02:25:43.934 --> 02:25:44.555]  Victor, go ahead.
[02:25:45.157 --> 02:25:46.217]  Hello Alex, how are you doing?
[02:25:46.457 --> 02:25:46.777]  Fine.
[02:25:47.617 --> 02:25:51.178]  I got your DVD, 9-11 Road to Purity.
[02:25:52.558 --> 02:25:53.578]  Really great stuff.
[02:25:53.658 --> 02:25:55.779]  I made about 15 copies so far.
[02:25:55.879 --> 02:25:56.459]  Well thank you!
[02:25:57.179 --> 02:26:00.840]  And I like your new website, Prison Planet TV.
[02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:13.462]  One aspect of that Rush clip that you may have covered and I just didn't hear, is his effort to legitimize skull and bones by saying it's just like a skull and bones initiation, it's just harmless.
[02:26:14.485 --> 02:26:18.107]  The last time I checked, the Skull and Bones initiations weren't harmless.
[02:26:18.147 --> 02:26:19.928]  They were more occult in nature.
[02:26:20.168 --> 02:26:21.548]  Well, they openly worship Satan.
[02:26:21.588 --> 02:26:23.149]  It's been caught on Fox News' air.
[02:26:23.169 --> 02:26:23.930]  It shows ABC.
[02:26:23.950 --> 02:26:25.790]  They go, hail Satan, kill him for Satan.
[02:26:25.810 --> 02:26:27.751]  They do mock sacrifices of women.
[02:26:28.452 --> 02:26:29.472]  And they do all of this.
[02:26:29.532 --> 02:26:33.934]  And so that's a message to the inner circle that, yeah, this is Skull and Bones.
[02:26:33.974 --> 02:26:35.075]  This is our sacrifices.
[02:26:35.095 --> 02:26:35.915]  This is our fun.
[02:26:36.676 --> 02:26:42.318]  And then for the profane, those of us that don't get it in their whole nomenclature, this is, oh, this is no big deal.
[02:26:42.398 --> 02:26:43.699]  See, it's multifaceted.
[02:26:44.562 --> 02:26:49.405]  Yeah, a lot of people still want to believe the lie though, the false left-right paradigm that you talk about.
[02:26:50.846 --> 02:26:52.667]  One other thing, those chemtrails.
[02:26:53.108 --> 02:27:02.474]  I'm thinking that the poisoning or the health effect may just be a side effect, that the real goal there is somehow tied in with heart.
[02:27:03.078 --> 02:27:04.558]  Some kind of Tesla technology.
[02:27:04.618 --> 02:27:09.860]  And the whole day after to create climatic change, to create fear in a global government, to counter the problem.
[02:27:10.160 --> 02:27:10.740]  Thanks for the call.
[02:27:10.800 --> 02:27:11.560]  Great points, Victor.
[02:27:11.581 --> 02:27:13.461]  Good to hear from you, North Carolina.
[02:27:13.481 --> 02:27:15.982]  Emmett in Pennsylvania, you're on the air globally.
[02:27:18.483 --> 02:27:23.764]  Yes, Alex, many thanks to you and WWCR for carrying your third daytime hour.
[02:27:24.004 --> 02:27:24.264]  Yes.
[02:27:24.444 --> 02:27:29.366]  Now, why, uh, yeah, I wouldn't air that video.
[02:27:29.406 --> 02:27:30.366]  Whoever taped it,
[02:27:31.571 --> 02:27:33.694]  Had the intention of everyone seeing it.
[02:27:33.734 --> 02:27:36.678]  But they're taping it to put their spin on it.
[02:27:37.138 --> 02:27:38.460]  We're countering it.
[02:27:40.102 --> 02:27:41.404]  We're analyzing it.
[02:27:41.884 --> 02:27:46.751]  A friend of mine also told me, he was in Vietnam, and he said the Muslims
[02:27:47.415 --> 02:27:49.316]  They don't like to be humiliated.
[02:27:49.737 --> 02:27:53.399]  They don't like to have a woman over them to boss them around.
[02:27:53.599 --> 02:27:58.522]  And so that's why they now admit the Army ordered the women to pose and do this.
[02:27:58.562 --> 02:28:01.104]  This is Army PSYOPS under CIA.
[02:28:01.344 --> 02:28:12.552]  This was all staged to release this, to then kill somebody, to legitimize it, while at the same time enraging the Arabs and enraging America so out of the crisis can come the One World Order.
[02:28:12.672 --> 02:28:16.074]  Well he told me they do it to get information out of them.
[02:28:16.980 --> 02:28:17.961]  By embarrassing them.
[02:28:18.361 --> 02:28:20.783]  But how can they have information?
[02:28:20.923 --> 02:28:21.863]  Hold on a second.
[02:28:21.904 --> 02:28:24.265]  CBS hasn't released lots of stuff.
[02:28:24.445 --> 02:28:26.887]  This has been out for years in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[02:28:27.427 --> 02:28:28.928]  But they just released this now.
[02:28:29.029 --> 02:28:29.669]  Why is that?
[02:28:30.470 --> 02:28:32.151]  It's part of the PSYOP now.
[02:28:32.911 --> 02:28:34.332]  Yeah.
[02:28:34.412 --> 02:28:36.714]  How can they have any information when they're in prison?
[02:28:38.627 --> 02:28:41.249]  Well, they admit that 70-90% were totally innocent.
[02:28:41.329 --> 02:28:44.511]  Families picked up at checkpoints because they didn't have their papers.
[02:28:45.192 --> 02:28:46.012]  Thank you very much.
[02:28:46.112 --> 02:28:47.073]  Carry on, Alex.
[02:28:47.133 --> 02:28:47.533]  Thank you.
[02:28:47.573 --> 02:28:48.714]  I appreciate it, Emmett.
[02:28:49.555 --> 02:28:52.697]  Let's go ahead and go to Roberta in Colorado.
[02:28:52.737 --> 02:28:53.557]  Roberta, go ahead.
[02:28:54.018 --> 02:28:54.898]  Good morning, Alex.
[02:28:55.018 --> 02:28:55.379]  Hello.
[02:28:55.799 --> 02:28:59.962]  I've listened to you for a couple years now and I finally got brave enough to phone you.
[02:29:00.582 --> 02:29:02.824]  Good to hear from you.
[02:29:02.844 --> 02:29:04.145]  I have bought your DVD.
[02:29:04.958 --> 02:29:07.000]  And I've lent it to a neighbor across the street.
[02:29:07.321 --> 02:29:07.661]  Good.
[02:29:07.921 --> 02:29:10.203]  I'll tell you what, stay there, but what do you want to talk about when we get back?
[02:29:10.304 --> 02:29:10.604]  Alright.
[02:29:11.605 --> 02:29:12.906]  What do you want to talk about when we get back?
[02:29:13.106 --> 02:29:22.956]  Oh, I just wanted to talk about, um, basically the Peanack and Skull and Bones and Hegelian dialect and how you get a... How can anyone learn all this?
[02:29:23.036 --> 02:29:23.537]  It's so deep.
[02:29:24.245 --> 02:29:25.306]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[02:29:25.667 --> 02:29:28.570]  You go off your own PNAC documents saying we need helpful terror attacks.
[02:29:28.610 --> 02:29:31.313]  We need dead Americans to get people behind the New World Order.
[02:29:31.353 --> 02:29:35.317]  We need to use this disaster for the New World Order, as Gary Hart said on national TV.
[02:29:36.218 --> 02:29:37.579]  This is GCN.

[02:29:41.083 --> 02:29:44.126]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:29:46.130 --> 02:29:50.033]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:29:50.253 --> 02:29:55.697]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:29:55.977 --> 02:30:06.344]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:30:06.504 --> 02:30:10.847]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:30:10.987 --> 02:30:11.467]  I don't know.
[02:30:26.141 --> 02:30:30.043]  We all have busy lives and sometimes that causes us to miss out on the things that are most important to us.
[02:30:30.063 --> 02:30:33.164]  Well, when it comes to Genesis programs, you'll never have to miss out again.

[02:31:54.213 --> 02:31:54.694]  time zone.
[02:31:54.874 --> 02:31:55.694]  This is the U.S.
[02:31:55.734 --> 02:31:58.335]  official atomic clock located in Fort Collins, Colorado.
[02:31:58.515 --> 02:32:03.276]  It's the same atomic clock that governs ship movements, radio stations, space flights, and warplanes.
[02:32:03.476 --> 02:32:05.417]  We use them right here at the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:32:05.697 --> 02:32:12.140]  These self-setting atomic clocks contain a completely hidden antenna and receiver tuned to the exact frequency of the official U.S.
[02:32:12.180 --> 02:32:12.820]  atomic clock.
[02:32:12.960 --> 02:32:13.780]  How accurate is it?

[02:32:21.084 --> 02:32:23.525]  If you travel, this is the last clock you'll ever buy.
[02:32:23.725 --> 02:32:24.565]  Even if you don't travel,
[02:32:24.785 --> 02:32:26.747]  You'll use it to set the time on your other clocks.
[02:32:26.968 --> 02:32:33.074]  And now, thanks to a limited-time offer, you can get one for only $19 complete with a 90-day money-back guarantee.

[02:33:56.469 --> 02:34:03.794]  Pay for the thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars of bandwidth per month because of the tens of millions of visitors.
[02:34:03.914 --> 02:34:11.459]  So, you're also helping us get the word out for about a tenth the cost of a cup of coffee a day.
[02:34:12.319 --> 02:34:17.863]  A cup of coffee is $1.50 most places now, and this is 15 cents a day, so about a tenth the cost.
[02:34:19.029 --> 02:34:24.190]  of a cup of coffee for all this information and to make this broadcast possible.
[02:34:24.210 --> 02:34:27.351]  The work we're doing with the websites that interface with the radio shows.
[02:34:27.391 --> 02:34:30.531]  We can document everything we're talking about as we cover it.
[02:34:31.172 --> 02:34:36.533]  That's the interactive synergy that the internet allows us to have with this broadcast radio show.
[02:34:37.153 --> 02:34:41.134]  So, PrisonPlanet.TV like your television.
[02:34:42.294 --> 02:34:43.534]  Also, I've made ten films.
[02:34:43.574 --> 02:34:44.114]  I've written a book.
[02:34:44.154 --> 02:34:44.814]  I've published a book.
[02:34:44.854 --> 02:34:46.215]  I carry other great videos.
[02:34:46.295 --> 02:34:47.195]  Other books on tape.
[02:34:48.738 --> 02:35:04.045]  other uh... books and information jews the preservation of firearms ownership has made the video innocence portrayed the most professionally produced pro-gun film i've ever seen it is discovery channel grade very powerful
[02:35:04.716 --> 02:35:07.458]  It's on DVD and VHS.
[02:35:07.478 --> 02:35:08.818]  $29.95 because it costs a lot to make it.
[02:35:08.838 --> 02:35:10.219]  It costs us a lot to get it from them.
[02:35:10.579 --> 02:35:11.840]  And it's the same price they sell it for.
[02:35:11.860 --> 02:35:18.904]  You get three free Grandpa Jack comic books going over the history of gun control and what's really going on.
[02:35:19.004 --> 02:35:23.587]  It's good for your average yuppie mindset out there at about a fifth grade level for them.
[02:35:23.607 --> 02:35:29.470]  I'm being sarcastic, but three of those frees you really get quite a bit for the price.
[02:35:30.585 --> 02:35:33.226]  So, that's a great film, Innocence Portrayed.
[02:35:33.246 --> 02:35:34.326]  Hit my videos!
[02:35:34.346 --> 02:35:38.027]  You're authorized to make copies of my videos, you're not the others, but of mine you are.

[02:35:53.911 --> 02:35:57.312]  Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove is my infiltration of the occult compound.
[02:35:58.426 --> 02:35:59.908]  You need to have these videos.

[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:25.081]  Forget the films or books, the t-shirts, the pro-gun t-shirts.
[02:36:25.541 --> 02:36:26.462]  That's why we're liberal.
[02:36:26.482 --> 02:36:29.163]  We're totally pro-gun, so we're liberal according to the neocons.
[02:36:29.183 --> 02:36:29.243]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:36:30.123 --> 02:36:30.803]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:36:30.823 --> 02:36:34.145]  Or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[02:36:51.431 --> 02:36:54.013]  Okay, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[02:36:54.653 --> 02:36:58.295]  We were talking to... Who were we talking to last?
[02:36:59.616 --> 02:37:00.876]  Roberta, I told her to hold.
[02:37:00.917 --> 02:37:08.261]  She wanted to talk about problem reaction solution, the Hegelian dialectic of thesis... synthesis.
[02:37:08.701 --> 02:37:11.242]  But go ahead and make your comments, Roberta.
[02:37:11.262 --> 02:37:11.863]  Thanks for holding.
[02:37:12.023 --> 02:37:12.443]  Well, hi.
[02:37:12.983 --> 02:37:15.585]  Hey, you know, I like your comment about the yuppie mindset.
[02:37:16.195 --> 02:37:23.227]  You know, we've got the mindset of globalism, we've got the mindset of yuppies, and then we've got the mindset of people that just are in denial.
[02:37:24.349 --> 02:37:28.256]  And it's all three real scary factors there.
[02:37:29.688 --> 02:37:34.770]  Yeah, the yuppie mindset is, I'm a member of the elite!
[02:37:34.850 --> 02:37:36.110]  I have my BMW!
[02:37:36.430 --> 02:37:39.371]  I have a Gucci handbag and rigged Starbucks, that's all that matters!
[02:37:39.872 --> 02:37:45.694]  And then you've got the neocon mindset, torture everybody, kill everybody, hand in the guns, it's conservative!
[02:37:46.534 --> 02:37:48.735]  And then you've got those that are just dumbed down.
[02:37:48.755 --> 02:37:49.635]  They don't want to know.
[02:37:50.755 --> 02:37:51.615]  Go ahead.
[02:37:51.676 --> 02:37:56.097]  Anyway, I live in Boulder, so it made me laugh because Boulder is full of yuppies.
[02:37:57.077 --> 02:38:04.581]  And thanks to The Globalist, I've had the opportunity to read books and study because of a lack of unemployment.
[02:38:04.661 --> 02:38:06.222]  I'm an unemployed high-tech worker.
[02:38:07.114 --> 02:38:18.978]  Oh, the wonders of NAFTA and GAP is going to get, the government says, seven times worse, and Bush said it's good, hamburger jobs are industrial, and shipping jobs are our number one commodity, he said.
[02:38:19.498 --> 02:38:21.178]  And I'm telling you, there's no work here.
[02:38:21.579 --> 02:38:24.580]  What, you don't think having a cheeseburger job is a good job?
[02:38:25.780 --> 02:38:29.081]  A skilled worker, value-added job, manufacturing?
[02:38:29.301 --> 02:38:29.521]  No.
[02:38:29.621 --> 02:38:34.404]  Maybe you're with Al-Qaeda if you don't think hamburger flipping is high-tech.
[02:38:34.744 --> 02:38:37.005]  I just don't think that's a very fulfilling way to go.
[02:38:37.025 --> 02:38:38.446]  Well, it sounds like you're with Al-Qaeda then.
[02:38:38.466 --> 02:38:40.387]  If you don't believe them, up is down, down is up.
[02:38:40.767 --> 02:38:43.889]  Well, you know, seriously though, I've reinvented myself.
[02:38:43.949 --> 02:38:47.551]  I'm going back to college and I'm reading three concurrent books here.
[02:38:47.571 --> 02:38:51.213]  The Creature from Jekyll Island, Fortunate Son, and Secrets of the Two.
[02:38:51.853 --> 02:38:52.613]  Three books at once.
[02:38:52.633 --> 02:38:53.614]  They're all good.
[02:38:54.478 --> 02:39:01.463]  And, you know, it is so deep that I don't see how anyone working 8 to 5 raising kids can become enlightened.
[02:39:01.503 --> 02:39:02.303]  How can you do it?
[02:39:02.524 --> 02:39:05.225]  Well, it is a complete study, but you can get the basics.
[02:39:05.305 --> 02:39:07.187]  Governments are tyrannical throughout history.
[02:39:07.487 --> 02:39:09.708]  Sociopathic control freaks get into control.
[02:39:09.969 --> 02:39:11.349]  You've got to limit the size of government.
[02:39:11.369 --> 02:39:12.370]  That's just historical.
[02:39:12.670 --> 02:39:18.734]  Then you look at case point examples, and once you've looked at 5% of this and proven it, then you know it's a pack of criminals.
[02:39:19.015 --> 02:39:22.517]  Then you can go deep into the master's degree level of this and live your life fighting it.
[02:39:23.874 --> 02:39:34.497]  Well, you know, I was really interested in the Hegelian dialect, how they can actually transform cultures, social structures, by inducing a crisis.
[02:39:34.737 --> 02:39:45.840]  It takes, it goes back to the cave, to the hut, a flood comes, or a quick shift in the environment, and there's a crisis, then everybody's ready to get up and move.
[02:39:46.460 --> 02:39:50.461]  But the chief of the witch doctor couldn't get him to move when everything was okay.
[02:39:50.541 --> 02:39:50.741]  Right.
[02:39:53.689 --> 02:39:55.270]  I don't know, I guess that's all I have to say.
[02:39:55.550 --> 02:40:01.113]  I've just listened to you for so long and I just finally wanted to call you and have a talk with you.
[02:40:01.133 --> 02:40:07.236]  What do you think about him grabbing this guy, the government having him in custody, releasing him, Al Qaeda gets him and kills him, pretty obvious.
[02:40:07.516 --> 02:40:16.221]  You know, I was so upset last night and my husband thinks, he says, oh you've got to quit listening to that radio show and quit reading all these books that upset you.
[02:40:16.741 --> 02:40:17.642]  Yeah, you shouldn't be upset.
[02:40:17.662 --> 02:40:19.504]  Just go back to sleep.
[02:40:19.545 --> 02:40:21.387]  Lay down next to the pod, honey.
[02:40:21.907 --> 02:40:25.512]  You'll be body snatched in the morning and we can all be together.
[02:40:25.572 --> 02:40:26.773]  No more pain, honey.
[02:40:26.894 --> 02:40:27.634]  Exactly.
[02:40:27.775 --> 02:40:28.856]  Don't torture yourself.
[02:40:30.965 --> 02:40:36.846]  Go buy a big bean pod and lay it next to the bed and say, here, let's lay down and be body snatchers, honey.
[02:40:37.247 --> 02:40:40.787]  Well, you know, I don't need to get divorced on top of everything else.
[02:40:40.807 --> 02:40:41.808]  No, no, I'm being sarcastic.
[02:40:41.828 --> 02:40:42.868]  No, I know you are, I know.
[02:40:42.988 --> 02:40:44.648]  But I think it's sad.
[02:40:44.668 --> 02:40:55.571]  I feel so sorry for the man and his family and I think his life and his death is being exploited and by the time I die, I hope I can have a peaceful death.
[02:40:56.308 --> 02:40:59.510]  But I just can't imagine having to end your life like that.
[02:40:59.530 --> 02:41:00.791]  It's sad.
[02:41:01.251 --> 02:41:02.952]  It's absolutely horrific.
[02:41:03.032 --> 02:41:03.992]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:41:04.013 --> 02:41:06.774]  I really appreciate your call.
[02:41:07.795 --> 02:41:11.117]  Let's go to Ryan in Michigan.
[02:41:11.177 --> 02:41:11.977]  Ryan, go ahead.
[02:41:11.997 --> 02:41:12.958]  No, no, I'm sorry.
[02:41:13.298 --> 02:41:13.898]  Put him on hold.
[02:41:14.178 --> 02:41:15.159]  Phil in England's next.
[02:41:15.199 --> 02:41:16.040]  He's on his dime.
[02:41:16.460 --> 02:41:17.580]  Phil in England, go ahead.
[02:41:17.921 --> 02:41:18.601]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:41:18.621 --> 02:41:19.982]  Your phone's a red hot today, aren't we?
[02:41:21.613 --> 02:41:23.394]  They are most days, but yes, what's on your mind?
[02:41:24.274 --> 02:41:25.935]  Just two things, Alex.
[02:41:26.275 --> 02:41:32.459]  On the Iraq photos that were released, very selective ones that were released, well, they were staged, obviously.
[02:41:33.179 --> 02:41:38.742]  The lawyer for one of the accused was on television last night here, saying that they were all staged.
[02:41:39.262 --> 02:41:40.283]  They were ordered to do it!
[02:41:40.683 --> 02:41:41.403]  Yes, exactly.
[02:41:41.483 --> 02:41:45.025]  But also, he cited as evidence a Washington Post-released photograph.
[02:41:45.892 --> 02:41:57.655]  Um, that's taken upon high in the prison, um, showing a CIA officer, uh, setting up the photo, um, standing next to a pile of bodies, uh, with his hand on, on the Iraq, on the Iraqi's, uh, neck.
[02:41:57.835 --> 02:41:58.655]  No, no, I've seen it!
[02:41:58.775 --> 02:42:08.338]  No, no, I mean, they're, they admit they're arranging the bodies for the shot, and the CIA operatives covering his face from the camera that he's looking at, and then the other dumbbells don't see it.
[02:42:08.798 --> 02:42:09.398]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:42:09.418 --> 02:42:13.420]  I was just wondering if you were going to post that or... That photo is posted on Infowars.com.
[02:42:13.440 --> 02:42:14.080]  It was a week ago.
[02:42:14.580 --> 02:42:14.860]  OK.
[02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:26.384]  Another thing, Alex, just changing tack slightly, I noticed on Slashtop saying that USA Today reports that clubbers in Barcelona are getting drunk and being implanted on site with RFID chips.
[02:42:26.684 --> 02:42:36.673]  Yeah, we had the CEO on a month and a half ago, Applied Digital, he said they're going to put it in all police, the entire Italian government's going to do it, and then it all came out in the news two weeks later.
[02:42:36.774 --> 02:42:40.577]  But there's a huge report on that on the website.
[02:42:40.877 --> 02:42:41.278]  Exactly.
[02:42:41.298 --> 02:42:46.363]  I saw you mention it ages ago, and USA Today are reporting it.
[02:42:46.583 --> 02:42:48.745]  Yeah, getting people drunk and giving them their microchip.
[02:42:49.586 --> 02:42:59.096]  You can't get into the area with the luscious females and for the women the men scantily clad the real VIPs area where the fun happens unless you get the chip.
[02:43:00.057 --> 02:43:06.043]  It says on Slashdot the article states that the implant can go anywhere however it does not state whether anyone has chosen their forehead.
[02:43:07.554 --> 02:43:08.575]  I really appreciate what you've been doing.
[02:43:08.595 --> 02:43:09.375]  I found you about a year ago.
[02:43:27.248 --> 02:43:30.049]  I can't thank you enough for your information.
[02:43:30.269 --> 02:43:31.930]  Well, I can't thank you enough for your listenership, sir.
[02:43:31.950 --> 02:43:36.411]  Yeah, I've got your films, and I've put out about 250 so far, and keep producing them.
[02:43:36.931 --> 02:43:39.592]  What effect is it happening when you give people the videos?
[02:43:39.712 --> 02:43:40.372]  They come back.
[02:43:40.432 --> 02:43:41.533]  Some of them come back, you know.
[02:43:42.033 --> 02:43:43.833]  And I've converted some people.
[02:43:44.414 --> 02:43:44.694]  Good.
[02:43:45.014 --> 02:43:45.214]  Yeah.
[02:43:45.894 --> 02:43:48.915]  The New World Order can't stand if we stand in the gap.
[02:43:49.415 --> 02:43:49.635]  Right.
[02:43:49.875 --> 02:43:50.076]  Right.
[02:43:50.176 --> 02:43:51.396]  If we get the information out.
[02:43:52.506 --> 02:44:15.072]  What I've got is, I've been researching this chemtrail thing intensely for the last couple months and I've got some of the government websites, if people are interested, you know, of how to contact these people or, you know, the... Well, the big news is that the Associated Press yesterday, Time Magazine this week, oh, we're teaching the children why the jets leave the chemtrails very low, you know, the contrails.
[02:44:15.392 --> 02:44:20.874]  It's good for you, it is making the earth darker, but... Yeah, global warming, all that.
[02:44:21.593 --> 02:44:28.778]  If you want the NASA website, just punch in Global Aerosol Climatology Project.
[02:44:29.038 --> 02:44:33.381]  We have links to those satellite photos of the entire country blocked out with it.
[02:44:33.841 --> 02:44:36.743]  Yeah, and the Navy is SpyWars.
[02:44:38.824 --> 02:44:43.427]  They have a lot of offices around the country.
[02:44:44.888 --> 02:44:47.950]  Just punch in SpyWars and Navy and you'll go into their website.
[02:44:49.136 --> 02:44:50.977]  Yeah, you can see what they're doing out over the oceans.
[02:44:51.338 --> 02:44:52.318]  Just right out in the open.
[02:44:52.338 --> 02:44:53.159]  Thanks for the call.
[02:44:53.879 --> 02:44:54.240]  Go ahead.
[02:44:56.421 --> 02:45:05.368]  The Navy Monterey Aerial Research Laboratory of Monterey is mostly concerned with the HAARP effects.
[02:45:05.888 --> 02:45:07.289]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[02:45:07.329 --> 02:45:08.290]  Let's talk to Tim.
[02:45:08.310 --> 02:45:09.831]  Tim, where are you calling us from?
[02:45:10.231 --> 02:45:11.452]  Oh, greetings Victoria today.
[02:45:11.492 --> 02:45:12.893]  Fine, where are you calling from?
[02:45:12.913 --> 02:45:14.254]  I'm calling from Ontario.
[02:45:14.534 --> 02:45:15.315]  Good, go ahead.
[02:45:15.876 --> 02:45:19.597]  Alex, I had a fellow in today, he's in my business.
[02:45:19.617 --> 02:45:22.818]  We were talking about Ken Charles too.
[02:45:22.838 --> 02:45:23.799]  And he's a military man.
[02:45:24.899 --> 02:45:29.320]  And first of all, initially he didn't believe that this was going on.
[02:45:29.360 --> 02:45:40.924]  He said, oh, it's just they're dumping fuel, or it's just they're doing this, doing that, you know, that it's 30,000 feet, you know, all the usual, whatever they put up as propaganda to try and explain it away.
[02:45:41.587 --> 02:45:46.310]  But as I showed him a few things and then I brought him up to the computer and I said, now look at this.
[02:45:47.251 --> 02:45:50.133]  And I pointed him to the main page on Barry and Blue's website there.
[02:45:50.714 --> 02:45:54.636]  And he said, well, that's not, that is not engine exhaust.
[02:45:54.676 --> 02:45:55.437]  That is not that.
[02:45:55.637 --> 02:45:56.998]  That's not even coming from the engine.
[02:45:57.819 --> 02:46:00.541]  So then I described to him what I found on Cliff Kernigham's site.
[02:46:00.841 --> 02:46:04.323]  And he said, well, it's barium oxide.
[02:46:04.363 --> 02:46:10.728]  And he said, if it's aluminum oxide and titanium oxide, he said, that's exactly what they're using for cloud seeding.
[02:46:11.581 --> 02:46:12.461]  I said, well, that's very interesting.
[02:46:12.481 --> 02:46:13.222]  Yeah, that's what happens.
[02:46:13.262 --> 02:46:20.705]  It flies by, it doesn't go away, it forms at lower levels than chondrails do, and then it forms clouds right in front of you.
[02:46:20.725 --> 02:46:24.506]  I've been in the yard doing yard work and watched it for five hours unfold.
[02:46:25.106 --> 02:46:26.387]  Well, we do the same thing here.
[02:46:26.427 --> 02:46:28.488]  You're not just the only people getting sprayed with this stuff.
[02:46:28.528 --> 02:46:29.088]  Everybody is.
[02:46:29.428 --> 02:46:30.068]  It's globally.
[02:46:30.089 --> 02:46:32.369]  It's now showing up in satellite photos everywhere.
[02:46:32.670 --> 02:46:34.130]  A few years ago it was just America.
[02:46:34.190 --> 02:46:34.830]  Thanks for the call.
[02:46:35.971 --> 02:46:37.812]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Minnesota.
[02:46:37.852 --> 02:46:38.552]  Steve, go ahead.
[02:46:40.396 --> 02:46:41.417]  I'm going to talk to you, Steve.
[02:46:41.617 --> 02:46:45.301]  Yeah, Alex, you're doing a fantastic job, along with Paul and Violet.
[02:46:45.822 --> 02:46:46.603]  Thank you.
[02:46:47.263 --> 02:46:53.310]  Yeah, Conrad Chase, what a hero he is, getting people so drunk that they do something stupid enough to get a chip in them.
[02:46:54.612 --> 02:46:57.774]  And then bragging that soon we'll have to have it globally to buy and sell.
[02:46:57.814 --> 02:46:59.075]  Oh yes, this is the plan.
[02:46:59.275 --> 02:47:00.556]  The CEO told me.
[02:47:00.576 --> 02:47:02.057]  Oh, it's so good.
[02:47:02.517 --> 02:47:03.898]  Yeah, that's pathetic.
[02:47:04.278 --> 02:47:08.301]  But I called because I have an idea and I'm a proud member of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:47:08.561 --> 02:47:08.881]  Okay.
[02:47:09.242 --> 02:47:13.504]  And I had some ideas that maybe you can implement in the future.
[02:47:13.524 --> 02:47:14.265]  Okay.
[02:47:14.445 --> 02:47:23.791]  I work with a bunch of imaging devices that work pretty fast and maybe you could, you said that you have like a room or two full of boxes full of papers, just all documents.
[02:47:24.284 --> 02:47:29.190]  Maybe you could image all this stuff and get some kind of a search and make it easier for you.
[02:47:29.390 --> 02:47:31.613]  Yeah, if I had the money for the employee to do it, I could.
[02:47:31.633 --> 02:47:35.537]  I mean, I literally get up early in the morning and I'm running until two in the morning.
[02:47:35.737 --> 02:47:36.959]  Just bam, bam, bam.
[02:47:37.199 --> 02:47:37.740]  Yes, you are.
[02:47:37.760 --> 02:47:41.244]  I make myself now take off an hour to go jog or swim or lift weights.
[02:47:42.642 --> 02:47:44.363]  Just because I perform better when I do that.
[02:47:45.344 --> 02:47:48.806]  I haven't eaten yet and I've been out working since 7am.
[02:47:49.026 --> 02:47:50.367]  Yeah, you're a very hard worker.
[02:47:50.427 --> 02:47:52.988]  I'd be willing to give you a lot of information about this.
[02:47:53.048 --> 02:47:53.989]  I could email it to you.
[02:47:54.369 --> 02:47:55.429]  No, I don't want to lie.
[02:47:55.469 --> 02:47:59.392]  I did take a handful of peanuts earlier.
[02:47:59.692 --> 02:48:01.093]  I'll send you an email sometime.
[02:48:01.133 --> 02:48:03.374]  I'll get a bunch of information about all this stuff.
[02:48:06.010 --> 02:48:07.951]  That I print off has been posted on the site.
[02:48:08.111 --> 02:48:11.552]  It's just that I keep it because sometimes the stories get taken down.
[02:48:12.092 --> 02:48:15.194]  Oh, okay, but I'm talking about like newspaper clippings, stuff like that, maybe?
[02:48:15.214 --> 02:48:17.535]  Hey, it's a good idea.
[02:48:17.595 --> 02:48:25.738]  Don't know, I have a garage full of newspaper clippings, I have a portable building full of newspaper clippings, and the last few months in this room, our stack's almost to the ceiling.
[02:48:26.138 --> 02:48:26.959]  Yeah, that's insane.
[02:48:27.059 --> 02:48:29.139]  I am amongst piles of news articles.
[02:48:29.500 --> 02:48:30.460]  Yes, I imagine you are.
[02:48:31.587 --> 02:48:35.809]  Well, I appreciate what you're doing and thanks for signing up at the website, my friend.
[02:48:35.909 --> 02:48:36.570]  Absolutely.
[02:48:36.970 --> 02:48:37.430]  Take care.
[02:48:38.330 --> 02:48:40.712]  Okay, we'll go to some more calls here in the final segment.
[02:48:42.252 --> 02:48:44.093]  Some of the other news here.
[02:48:44.193 --> 02:48:47.155]  Again, the family angry with American government over son's brutal death.
[02:48:48.915 --> 02:48:59.558]  And they are saying that the video showed Nick Berg, 26, in a staged execution carried out by an Al-Qaeda affiliate group, Al-C-I-A-D affiliate group.
[02:48:59.998 --> 02:49:06.720]  The video said the killing was to avenge the abuse of Iraq prisoners by American soldiers.
[02:49:07.801 --> 02:49:12.382]  And the family, so the State Department official said Monday, had told them of Berg's decapitation.
[02:49:12.762 --> 02:49:15.863]  The family, though, had wanted the information to remain private.
[02:49:15.903 --> 02:49:18.244]  Now it's out everywhere and they're putting their spin on it, so we're exposing it.
[02:49:18.929 --> 02:49:21.771]  When told about the website, Berg's father and sister began to cry.
[02:49:22.452 --> 02:49:27.595]  And then it goes on, and then Michael Berg, the father, laughed out the U.S.
[02:49:27.635 --> 02:49:32.399]  military and Bush administration, saying his son might still be alive had he not been detained by U.S.
[02:49:32.459 --> 02:49:36.502]  officials in Iraq without being charged and without access to a lawyer.
[02:49:36.582 --> 02:49:40.504]  Nick Berg, a small-told communications business owner, spoke to his parents on March 24th and told them
[02:49:41.505 --> 02:49:43.365]  That he would return home on March 30th.
[02:49:43.465 --> 02:49:49.427]  Buttberg was detained by Iraq police and put into a coalition prison in a checkpoint in Mosul.
[02:49:49.887 --> 02:49:51.927]  On March 24th, he was turned over to U.S.
[02:49:51.967 --> 02:49:53.808]  officials and detained for 13 days.
[02:49:54.428 --> 02:49:58.869]  His father, Michael, said his son wasn't allowed to make phone calls or contact a lawyer.
[02:49:58.889 --> 02:50:04.730]  And then he wasn't released until right after, again, they talked to CBS and told them to hold back the photos.
[02:50:04.990 --> 02:50:05.950]  Then they released him.
[02:50:06.250 --> 02:50:09.291]  He gets grabbed that day, killed supposedly by Al-Qaeda.
[02:50:10.154 --> 02:50:15.998]  FBI agents visited Berg's parents in Westchester on March 31st and told them the family they were trying to confirm their son's identity.
[02:50:16.759 --> 02:50:19.240]  So again, admitting they were holding him, but now they're denying it.
[02:50:19.600 --> 02:50:25.124]  On April 5th, that Berg's filed suit in federal court in Philadelphia, contending that their son was being held illegally by U.S.
[02:50:25.164 --> 02:50:25.544]  military.
[02:50:25.584 --> 02:50:26.825]  The next day, Berg was released.
[02:50:27.206 --> 02:50:29.027]  He told his parents he hadn't been mistreated.
[02:50:31.248 --> 02:50:33.510]  And it goes on, Michael Berg said he blamed the U.S.
[02:50:33.550 --> 02:50:35.851]  government for creating circumstances that led to his son's death.
[02:50:36.432 --> 02:50:38.153]  He said his son hadn't been detained.
[02:50:39.017 --> 02:50:42.239]  For so long, he might have been able to leave the country before the violence worsened.
[02:50:43.040 --> 02:50:43.940]  We'll come back, folks.
[02:50:43.960 --> 02:50:44.421]  Stay with us.
[02:50:45.941 --> 02:50:50.284]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:50:50.484 --> 02:50:54.907]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:50:55.067 --> 02:50:59.410]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:50:59.470 --> 02:51:00.811]  The New World Order.
[02:51:01.591 --> 02:51:02.292]  Panama.
[02:51:02.613 --> 02:51:06.817]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:51:06.897 --> 02:51:13.825]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:51:13.945 --> 02:51:15.968]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:51:16.368 --> 02:51:26.735]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:51:26.955 --> 02:51:32.318]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:51:32.838 --> 02:51:36.220]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:51:36.240 --> 02:51:36.601]  That's 888-253-3139.

[02:51:45.620 --> 02:51:47.221]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:51:47.381 --> 02:51:51.482]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:51:51.622 --> 02:51:54.483]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:51:54.583 --> 02:52:01.245]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:52:01.465 --> 02:52:04.470]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:52:04.690 --> 02:52:07.054]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:52:07.214 --> 02:52:17.369]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as atrazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[02:52:17.549 --> 02:52:26.671]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[02:52:26.831 --> 02:52:32.873]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:52:32.893 --> 02:52:33.153]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:52:33.173 --> 02:52:34.513]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:52:46.579 --> 02:52:46.899]  I think so.
[02:53:01.804 --> 02:53:02.465]  We're good to go!
[02:53:31.323 --> 02:53:34.425]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:53:34.585 --> 02:53:40.447]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:53:51.946 --> 02:54:01.155]  Congress is trying to pass a video lawyer law where they can have all their video cameras in public, but then prosecute you if you do something in public.
[02:54:01.255 --> 02:54:04.018]  It, again, always sounds good on the surface.
[02:54:04.038 --> 02:54:04.959]  It has nothing to do with it.
[02:54:05.620 --> 02:54:09.544]  Also, the lawyer for the female military police officer ordered to pose for photos.
[02:54:09.584 --> 02:54:10.585]  That's all admitted now.
[02:54:12.084 --> 02:54:15.245]  Also, Australian soldiers facing dismissal for torturing kittens.
[02:54:15.265 --> 02:54:16.465]  We talked about that yesterday.
[02:54:16.825 --> 02:54:20.066]  Killing kittens in front of children, dragging them around on fire in front of people.
[02:54:20.466 --> 02:54:22.327]  This is just psychotic behavior.
[02:54:23.147 --> 02:54:28.668]  The Hill is reporting the presidential push fails to quell GOP fear of Patriot Act.
[02:54:28.688 --> 02:54:37.371]  A group of Libertarian minor Republicans in Congress is blocking President Bush's effort to strengthen domestic counter-terrorism laws and reauthorize the USA Patriot Act.
[02:54:37.391 --> 02:54:38.651]  Bush wants to expand it, folks.
[02:54:39.051 --> 02:54:41.673]  Which the President has made one of his top domestic priorities this year.
[02:54:42.193 --> 02:54:53.901]  As a result of this opposition, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican, Wisconsin, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was forced last week to cancel panel consideration of legislation that would have given law enforcement officials more tools.
[02:54:53.961 --> 02:54:55.162]  See, more tools.
[02:54:56.042 --> 02:54:57.803]  The key stuff in there isn't sunsetted.
[02:54:58.044 --> 02:54:58.884]  That's a red herring.
[02:54:58.924 --> 02:54:59.705]  It's in perpetuity.
[02:55:00.325 --> 02:55:07.730]  As other administration policy initiatives, such as manned mission to Mars, have languished in Congress, Bush has emphasized the importance of renewing the Patriot Act next year.
[02:55:09.102 --> 02:55:12.024]  They'll tell you you're a liberal if you're against it when the liberals all voted for it.
[02:55:13.145 --> 02:55:16.107]  Just like they voted for the war, gun control, Bush's policies.
[02:55:17.708 --> 02:55:19.169]  Let's jam a few final calls in.
[02:55:19.189 --> 02:55:20.350]  You've each got a minute apiece.
[02:55:20.770 --> 02:55:21.631]  Chris in Texas.
[02:55:21.651 --> 02:55:22.451]  Go ahead, Chris.
[02:55:23.352 --> 02:55:23.552]  Alex?
[02:55:23.832 --> 02:55:24.052]  Yes.
[02:55:24.092 --> 02:55:24.413]  John?
[02:55:24.753 --> 02:55:25.173]  Yes.
[02:55:25.874 --> 02:55:27.655]  Okay, that Limbaugh clip you've been playing.
[02:55:27.855 --> 02:55:28.115]  Yes.
[02:55:28.135 --> 02:55:28.415]  Okay.
[02:55:28.896 --> 02:55:33.699]  Well, I'm listening to you here on one of these pirate stations here in Austin, and I live in Hutto, and you've cut out.
[02:55:33.939 --> 02:55:36.561]  So I flipped over to Limbaugh to see what he was talking about.
[02:55:37.284 --> 02:55:38.964]  Get one of your interns to check this out.
[02:55:39.005 --> 02:55:49.267]  At 1.40pm, he starts demonizing the Iraqi people just in general, calling them filth, slime of humanity, debris.
[02:55:49.287 --> 02:55:53.049]  Did he call the Iraqi sub-humans like Savage did?
[02:55:53.989 --> 02:55:55.089]  Uh, it was worse.
[02:55:55.829 --> 02:55:56.390]  It was worse.
[02:55:56.430 --> 02:55:58.750]  So he was specifically talking about everybody?
[02:55:59.270 --> 02:56:00.611]  Yeah, this was the spin though.
[02:56:00.651 --> 02:56:01.271]  Here's the kicker.
[02:56:01.798 --> 02:56:05.940]  It was trying to explain away why our soldiers are killing women and children.
[02:56:06.300 --> 02:56:09.942]  He said they're using their own families as human shields.
[02:56:10.323 --> 02:56:10.743]  No, no, no.
[02:56:10.803 --> 02:56:12.544]  They take them in the prisons and kill them.
[02:56:14.225 --> 02:56:15.065]  This is the spin.
[02:56:15.485 --> 02:56:15.806]  All right.
[02:56:15.846 --> 02:56:16.586]  Thank you for the call.
[02:56:16.626 --> 02:56:17.286]  I'll check it out.
[02:56:17.306 --> 02:56:17.727]  Thank you.
[02:56:18.107 --> 02:56:19.067]  Jeff in Louisiana.
[02:56:19.107 --> 02:56:19.808]  Jeff, go ahead.
[02:56:19.968 --> 02:56:20.828]  Hello, Alex.
[02:56:21.209 --> 02:56:21.509]  Yes.
[02:56:21.629 --> 02:56:24.510]  I'm on a website called Break4News.com.
[02:56:24.530 --> 02:56:31.134]  They got a headline here in the story, Beheaded Man's Firm Was on Right-Wing Enemies List.
[02:56:32.037 --> 02:56:41.022]  It goes down here it says the family firm of the head of America Nick Berg was named by a conservative website in a list of enemies of the Iraq occupation.
[02:56:41.522 --> 02:56:44.124]  They could explain his arrest by Iraqi police.
[02:56:44.617 --> 02:56:49.799]  A detention which fatally delayed his planned return from Iraq and may have led directly to his death.
[02:56:50.299 --> 02:56:56.521]  Email that immediately to tips at infowars.com and also the webmaster at Prison Planet, okay?
[02:56:56.981 --> 02:56:57.321]  Okay.
[02:56:57.341 --> 02:56:58.341]  Send me all this info.
[02:56:58.361 --> 02:57:02.703]  We'll post it on the Prison Planet TV story photos and video.
[02:57:03.343 --> 02:57:03.903]  Okay then.
[02:57:04.343 --> 02:57:05.603]  Yeah, more is emerging.
[02:57:05.663 --> 02:57:05.923]  More.
[02:57:05.964 --> 02:57:06.604]  That's interesting.
[02:57:07.424 --> 02:57:09.305]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Delaware.
[02:57:09.405 --> 02:57:10.145]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:57:10.785 --> 02:57:11.925]  Hey, how's it going?
[02:57:12.125 --> 02:57:12.465]  Great, sir.
[02:57:17.525 --> 02:57:19.927]  Unfortunately, sir, your cell phone's no good.
[02:57:19.967 --> 02:57:21.829]  Should I take some more calls or are we out of here, guys?
[02:57:23.370 --> 02:57:25.312]  Okay, I don't have time to get to any more.
[02:57:25.372 --> 02:57:26.513]  I'm sorry, Mike.
[02:57:26.533 --> 02:57:32.157]  Call me back tomorrow, 11 to 2 during the day, Central Standard Time.
[02:57:32.177 --> 02:57:33.598]  I just hit my microphone into my face.
[02:57:33.618 --> 02:57:34.159]  That felt good.
[02:57:35.360 --> 02:57:38.562]  Join me tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central.
[02:57:39.163 --> 02:57:42.766]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight, Central Standard Time.
[02:57:43.999 --> 02:57:47.300]  And we'll be doing a special report on this tonight, a text report.
[02:57:47.320 --> 02:57:50.381]  I'm going to write an article about this with all the key links.
[02:57:50.401 --> 02:57:55.362]  There's already a lot of it on PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:57:55.422 --> 02:58:08.666]  And please sign up to PrisonPlanet.tv today and be a founding supporter in this fight against the New World Order with our new Infobomb salvo we've launched at the Mountains of Lies being perpetrated by the globalists.
[02:58:08.686 --> 02:58:10.086]  And remember, you're a human being.
[02:58:10.106 --> 02:58:10.906]  You have value.
[02:58:11.186 --> 02:58:13.287]  Torture and murder by any group is wrong.
[02:58:14.051 --> 02:58:15.793]  This is obviously a CIA op.
[02:58:16.094 --> 02:58:17.576]  Al Qaeda is CIA.
[02:58:17.616 --> 02:58:23.023]  The government had this guy in custody and handed him right over to these people and we will expose it.
[02:58:23.123 --> 02:58:23.864]  You should too!
[02:58:25.288 --> 02:58:27.109]  Again, more powerful broadcast coming up.
[02:58:27.189 --> 02:58:28.450]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:58:28.710 --> 02:58:29.711]  Rebroadcast 1 a.m.
[02:58:29.731 --> 02:58:30.232]  to 4 a.m.
[02:58:30.272 --> 02:58:30.732]  as well.
[02:58:31.032 --> 02:58:32.153]  And back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:58:32.393 --> 02:58:39.538]  Now get out there and expose the murdering terrorists that are the New World Order that want to... Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[02:58:39.818 --> 02:58:43.321]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:58:43.421 --> 02:58:47.363]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:58:47.584 --> 02:58:53.708]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:58:54.128 --> 02:58:54.769]  We're good to go.
[02:59:08.965 --> 02:59:09.365]  We're good to go!
