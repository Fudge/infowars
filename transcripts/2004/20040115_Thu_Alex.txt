[00:00:05.234 --> 00:00:08.037]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.094 --> 00:00:17.755]  Big Brother.
[00:00:18.395 --> 00:00:19.476]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:20.176 --> 00:00:21.317]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:21.337 --> 00:00:22.778]  You want answers?
[00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.400]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.723]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:33.406]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:39.131]  All right, my friends, it's Monday, the 12th of January, 2003.
[00:00:41.815 --> 00:00:52.317]  They're claiming that over the weekend they found several dozen small chemical warhead mortars buried under a road in southern Iraq.
[00:00:53.758 --> 00:00:54.778]  Now, that could be true.
[00:00:54.818 --> 00:01:02.020]  We know Saddam was sold masses of chemical and biological weapons in the precursors as well by the Russians, by the U.S.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.681]  We know that there are hundreds of confirmed sites, that is, declared sites,
[00:01:08.348 --> 00:01:08.529]  I think.
[00:01:14.685 --> 00:01:27.131]  And many times during the war and after the war, the globalists would go into one of these declared sites and say, look, we found sarin gas or World War I-style mustard gas.
[00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:30.113]  We have proven there's weapons of mass destruction.
[00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:35.776]  And then the news would quietly the next day retract it and say, okay, it was a declared site.
[00:01:35.956 --> 00:01:39.938]  Understand, they don't just have to find weapons of mass destruction.
[00:01:41.058 --> 00:01:44.300]  They have to find weapons of mass destruction that was not declared
[00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:58.450]  I mean, the UN ran around that country for 12 years after the war, blowing up declared chemical weapons or any type of equipment that could make chemical weapons or even make precursors to chemical weapons.
[00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.452]  That's why Iraq wasn't even allowed to have a chemical industry to make fertilizer or anything.
[00:02:03.512 --> 00:02:04.152]  Did you know that?
[00:02:04.892 --> 00:02:09.834]  They had to buy everything from the West or from outside of their country.
[00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:19.033]  But now they're saying they found some weapons of mass destruction, but they're not really heralding it in the newspapers and on television that I've seen.
[00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:24.316]  Meanwhile, Blair is saying, Blair admits weapons of mass destruction may never be found.
[00:02:25.156 --> 00:02:29.159]  But he said a few months ago that he would resign if they were not found.
[00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:35.282]  He stated his position as the Prime Minister on it.
[00:02:36.242 --> 00:02:37.583]  So try to figure that out.
[00:02:37.603 --> 00:02:39.104]  And then again last week he said that
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.721]  We're good to go.
[00:02:41.801 --> 00:02:42.121]  I think?
[00:03:12.256 --> 00:03:13.317]  We're good to go.
[00:03:13.417 --> 00:03:13.958]  I think?
[00:03:35.788 --> 00:03:39.611]  We're good to go.
[00:03:39.771 --> 00:03:40.952]  We're good to go.
[00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:02.544]  Well, continuing here, my friends.
[00:04:02.624 --> 00:04:04.967]  Also, there's a story here.
[00:04:18.496 --> 00:04:19.156]  We're good to go.
[00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:19.716]  We're good to go.
[00:04:46.796 --> 00:04:52.962]  Because this is very, very suspicious stuff to have a mother.
[00:04:53.243 --> 00:04:54.664]  Well, they said she was a homeschooler.
[00:04:54.704 --> 00:04:57.727]  That was the main suspicion, but she didn't say anything suspicious.
[00:04:57.747 --> 00:05:03.613]  But you know, we have the footage and the documents where the FBI says that homeschoolers are potential terrorists.
[00:05:04.634 --> 00:05:07.216]  Yeah, anybody who isn't part of this screwed up system.
[00:05:07.516 --> 00:05:08.557]  So we'll get to that as well.
[00:05:08.577 --> 00:05:09.718]  A lot of news coming up.
[00:05:09.738 --> 00:05:10.139]  Stay with us.
[00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:17.955]  Hey, folks, Michael Trudeau... I now own my own home, free and clear, and I did it in less than five months.
[00:05:18.055 --> 00:05:19.377]  Did you receive an inheritance?
[00:05:19.597 --> 00:05:20.077]  Well, no.
[00:05:20.237 --> 00:05:24.941]  Actually, I found a way to eliminate my mortgage without bankruptcy and without the need of going to court.
[00:05:25.061 --> 00:05:28.324]  And you, too, can do this legally, lawfully, ethically, and morally.
[00:05:28.404 --> 00:05:30.826]  But, Jim, I signed a note promising to pay back the loan.
[00:05:30.966 --> 00:05:32.968]  Isn't it wrong even if I could discharge the loan?
[00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:38.051]  Doris, I felt the same way until I took the time to learn the truth about money and banking.
[00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:42.054]  The most shocking thing I learned is the fact that no real money is ever loaned out.
[00:05:42.194 --> 00:05:44.896]  There's a dirty secret that the banks don't want you to know.
[00:05:45.056 --> 00:05:48.639]  And this is the basis of how I was able to discharge my own mortgage.
[00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:51.761]  I know this is hard to believe, but go to the website to learn more.
[00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:59.266]  Doris, get your pin and find out how many Americans are finding financial freedom by having their mortgages eliminated in less than five months.
[00:06:04.233 --> 00:06:06.657]  Just the way it sounds, and there's an S after mortgage.
[00:06:06.857 --> 00:06:11.524]  It's www.eliminatemortgages.com slash liberty.
[00:06:12.142 --> 00:06:22.865]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:06:23.045 --> 00:06:30.607]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:30.927 --> 00:06:34.028]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:06:34.288 --> 00:06:40.030]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:46.472]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:06:46.832 --> 00:06:50.733]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:06:50.773 --> 00:06:52.674]  The water level is always visible.
[00:06:52.854 --> 00:06:58.795]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:06:59.035 --> 00:07:02.737]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:07:08.778 --> 00:07:10.919]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:18.662]  Hey, folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:07:18.962 --> 00:07:20.342]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[00:07:20.542 --> 00:07:22.743]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:07:22.903 --> 00:07:24.984]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:07:25.244 --> 00:07:30.226]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:07:30.526 --> 00:07:34.547]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:07:34.827 --> 00:07:36.588]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:07:36.668 --> 00:07:47.312]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and planable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:07:47.452 --> 00:07:49.352]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:07:49.572 --> 00:07:53.414]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[00:07:53.534 --> 00:07:55.095]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:06.599]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:07.360]  I love America.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.101]  I love this country.
[00:08:09.121 --> 00:08:09.621]  I love my family.
[00:08:09.641 --> 00:08:16.344]  I don't like...
[00:08:32.114 --> 00:08:41.018]  Sitting here with front row seats to the deconstruction of our constitutional republic, our borders, our families, our Second Amendment.
[00:08:42.899 --> 00:08:56.325]  I can't stand the fact that the IMF, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, the UN have more control over our economy, our states, our counties, our cities than the American people do, than Congress does.
[00:08:57.706 --> 00:09:00.827]  Because Congress has been signing away their authority to the President
[00:09:01.454 --> 00:09:01.834]  We're good to go.
[00:09:01.854 --> 00:09:02.254]  We're good to go.
[00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:42.146]  That the Treasury Secretary, Paul O'Neill, said that, oh yeah, the plan was all along to invade Iraq, to attack Iraq.
[00:09:42.186 --> 00:09:51.033]  And they're all, oh, this is an incredible development, but then 60 Minutes makes a couple of excuses for it and says some nice things about Bush, and oh, well, it's really no big deal.
[00:09:51.053 --> 00:09:52.174]  That's what they do.
[00:09:52.214 --> 00:10:00.961]  They take incredibly damaging evidence of premeditated lying and warmongering and imperial fascism
[00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:12.505]  And they transmute it over into, oh, it's no big deal, by having 60 Minutes calmly report on it like it's a side issue.
[00:10:13.645 --> 00:10:16.346]  Well, forget what Paul O'Neill has to say.
[00:10:16.786 --> 00:10:18.106]  We have Dick Cheney.
[00:10:18.527 --> 00:10:20.087]  We have George Bush.
[00:10:20.487 --> 00:10:22.667]  We have his brother, Jeb Bush.
[00:10:23.027 --> 00:10:24.668]  We have Paul Wolfowitz.
[00:10:25.448 --> 00:10:28.729]  We have Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld.
[00:10:28.809 --> 00:10:29.689]  We have them all.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:39.225]  In dozens and dozens and dozens, there's several hundred, PNAC reports, and I've probably read or scanned through about 60 or 70 of them.
[00:10:39.526 --> 00:10:41.707]  I spend many hours reading PNAC documents.
[00:10:42.047 --> 00:10:57.397]  Every time I find some new indescribable horror, we'll post a link to the PNAC document from PNAC's own website, Project for a New American Century, and then we'll watch it in the next few days and weeks develop into major news stories.
[00:10:58.041 --> 00:11:07.407]  Because the mainstream media, the Associated Press, Reuters, Gannett News Service, Knight Ritter, are so lazy, I have to go out and write an analysis of Patriot Act.
[00:11:07.607 --> 00:11:10.569]  I have to go out and find subsections of bills.
[00:11:10.869 --> 00:11:12.270]  You as listeners do that.
[00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:21.896]  Time and time again, you'll see it on the so-called alternative media, six months, two years, five years, before you see it in the mainstream news.
[00:11:23.197 --> 00:11:24.217]  So what is PNAC?
[00:11:24.257 --> 00:11:26.719]  It was Bush's kind of exploratory...
[00:11:27.717 --> 00:11:41.229]  presidential committee that was formed in 1997 that wrote some of its most chilling forecasts and wishes and plans in 2000.
[00:11:42.936 --> 00:12:01.386]  And in rebuilding America's defenses, written by Cheney and Rumsfeld, different documents on the PNAC website are collaborative efforts by different members of this administration and surrounding think tanks, phony neocon think tanks.
[00:12:02.646 --> 00:12:07.869]  And they say, word for word, Saddam is not a threat, but he is a convenient pretext
[00:12:08.524 --> 00:12:09.305]  We're good to go.
[00:12:09.325 --> 00:12:09.925]  We're good to go.
[00:12:32.125 --> 00:12:35.369]  That's where my frustration comes from on this show.
[00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:43.819]  Everything I talk about, well, 98% of what I talk about is admitted, documented, public fact.
[00:12:43.919 --> 00:12:50.807]  I don't care how loony tunes it sounds, later, especially long-time listeners, know it always comes out.
[00:12:52.125 --> 00:13:00.820]  That is in the mainstream news, because all I'm going off of is legislation, government white papers, what globalists are communicating in amongst themselves.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.087]  I spend four or five hours a day researching their activities.
[00:13:07.384 --> 00:13:13.989]  New York discussing the case for the Iraq War in an interview with Times White House correspondent John Dickerson.
[00:13:14.049 --> 00:13:22.555]  Former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, who sat on the National Security Council, says the focus was on Saddam from the early days of the administration.
[00:13:23.496 --> 00:13:26.398]  He offers the most skeptical view of the case for war.
[00:13:27.565 --> 00:13:37.070]  Ever put forward by a top administration official in the 23 months I was there, I never saw anything that I could characterize as evidence of weapons of mass destruction.
[00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:51.698]  Each whole time, there were allegations and assertions by people, but I've been around a hell of a long time, and I know the difference between evidence and assertions and allusions or allusions and allusions.
[00:13:52.481 --> 00:13:53.541]  We're good to go.
[00:13:53.561 --> 00:13:54.121]  We're good to go.
[00:14:15.777 --> 00:14:23.079]  Written by almost everyone in the White House, including the President and his brother and the Vice President and the head of the Defense Department.
[00:14:23.579 --> 00:14:29.501]  Instead of going right to their own confessions that they published, there's no questions about this.
[00:14:32.422 --> 00:14:36.323]  It'd be like if I committed some grisly murder and I shot video of it and...
[00:14:38.012 --> 00:14:47.782]  I wrote down my confession and put it in an envelope and mailed it to police, and then police said, well, we're not going to arrest Mr. Jones, even though we have the videos of this and his signed confession.
[00:14:48.423 --> 00:14:56.712]  We're going to go ask the mailman who does his route in another part of the city if he saw Mr. Jones commit this murder.
[00:14:59.659 --> 00:15:03.442]  Now, that's an interesting analogy, but that's how ridiculous this is.
[00:15:03.902 --> 00:15:12.287]  See, by focusing in on O'Neal, they can say, this is the guy that made the markets in Brazil plunge.
[00:15:12.468 --> 00:15:16.270]  This is the guy that caused the stock market to go down when he made comments.
[00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:21.634]  This is the guy that went to Africa and was hanging out with Bono from U2.
[00:15:22.054 --> 00:15:23.575]  Man, this guy's a quack.
[00:15:24.153 --> 00:15:25.993]  Don't listen to John O'Neill.
[00:15:26.033 --> 00:15:30.854]  He's just got sour grapes because Dick Cheney called him up and said, I want you to resign.
[00:15:32.195 --> 00:15:35.995]  And that's what the neocons, I heard them this weekend on talk radio, were saying.
[00:15:36.275 --> 00:15:47.658]  Well, hey, neocons, why don't you just go to the confessions of the president, of the vice president, of his cabinet?
[00:15:47.998 --> 00:15:49.098]  They don't just talk about...
[00:15:49.804 --> 00:15:55.368]  Saddam isn't a threat, but he's a convenient pretext to get the oil and attack the neighbors and use Iraq as a base.
[00:15:55.848 --> 00:15:57.269]  I mean, it says that, folks.
[00:15:57.789 --> 00:16:00.051]  That's a paraphrase, but it's almost identical.
[00:16:00.071 --> 00:16:00.991]  I'm going from memory here.
[00:16:01.552 --> 00:16:03.053]  You can just type that into a search engine.
[00:16:03.073 --> 00:16:04.414]  You'll find hundreds of articles about it.
[00:16:05.194 --> 00:16:06.815]  And that's just the 2000 document.
[00:16:07.015 --> 00:16:07.916]  Go read it for yourself.
[00:16:08.296 --> 00:16:09.637]  Rebuilding America's Defenses, 2000.
[00:16:11.298 --> 00:16:12.559]  What else is in that document?
[00:16:13.815 --> 00:16:18.217]  Dick Cheney talks about maybe we need to legitimize the use.
[00:16:18.257 --> 00:16:19.018]  He doesn't say maybe.
[00:16:19.058 --> 00:16:26.881]  He says we need to legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons and legitimize their use in the media.
[00:16:27.602 --> 00:16:29.423]  Race-specific bioweapons.
[00:16:29.763 --> 00:16:31.884]  I mean, what a little jewel that is.
[00:16:32.836 --> 00:16:42.019]  Can you imagine if you or I got on the radio or wrote a news article about how maybe we should develop race-specific bioweapons and legitimize their use?
[00:16:42.539 --> 00:16:46.720]  I would expect I'd have the FBI, Mr. Jones, get out here.
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:47.840]  We've got questions for you.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:48.641]  Get out here.
[00:16:48.681 --> 00:16:49.901]  We're knocking down the door.
[00:16:50.221 --> 00:16:51.802]  See, we had a real FBI.
[00:16:52.182 --> 00:16:53.262]  That's who they'd be after.
[00:16:53.914 --> 00:16:55.415]  But no, we're not saying that.
[00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:56.416]  We're not writing that.
[00:16:56.496 --> 00:16:57.357]  We're not doing that.
[00:16:57.577 --> 00:16:58.718]  We're fighting against that.
[00:16:59.158 --> 00:17:05.683]  But the Vice President says we need to legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons with the public.
[00:17:07.044 --> 00:17:09.366]  Do you know what a race-specific bioweapon is?
[00:17:09.726 --> 00:17:10.427]  I know most of you do.
[00:17:10.927 --> 00:17:15.571]  It's a bioweapon that kills certain races of people.
[00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:25.074]  Again, I mean, that's so big, that's so evil, that's so out of control, so overt, I don't have words to describe it.
[00:17:26.274 --> 00:17:27.555]  Maybe you want to comment on it.
[00:17:27.575 --> 00:17:28.875]  1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[00:17:28.895 --> 00:17:32.857]  So, this whole O'Neal thing is not vindication for this show and other broadcasts.
[00:17:43.701 --> 00:17:45.142]  Okay, we don't need vindication.
[00:17:45.202 --> 00:17:52.928]  We have the signed confessions of these people from their own battle plans, which they haven't tried to hide because they know the media is on their side.
[00:17:53.909 --> 00:18:02.675]  But so much of this PNAC news has come out that they are allowing this O'Neal story to come forward, and I have no doubt it is sour grapes, and he is telling the truth.
[00:18:02.735 --> 00:18:06.338]  Not because I think O'Neal is a good guy, but because I already have the documents.
[00:18:07.978 --> 00:18:14.023]  And so now the neocons, the Rush Limbaugh's of the world, can attack O'Neal and say it's just sour grapes.
[00:18:15.664 --> 00:18:19.487]  And go, oh, the big O didn't like being bullied.
[00:18:19.527 --> 00:18:20.307]  What a wimp.
[00:18:21.929 --> 00:18:23.770]  He didn't agree with Bush's tax cuts.
[00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:24.751]  He's a liberal.
[00:18:24.831 --> 00:18:25.171]  See?
[00:18:25.652 --> 00:18:27.433]  This is how the left is getting at us.
[00:18:28.133 --> 00:18:29.094]  On and on and on.
[00:18:29.615 --> 00:18:30.455]  It's a joke.
[00:18:31.176 --> 00:18:36.500]  And so it will descend down into those types of debates.
[00:18:38.949 --> 00:18:41.290]  And try to get in one of these neocon shows.
[00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.370]  Try to get into the show and talk about PNAC.
[00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.271]  They'll screen you off the air.
[00:18:45.971 --> 00:18:47.832]  If it's a national show, you're not going to get on.
[00:18:47.872 --> 00:18:51.353]  If it's a local show, probably you won't be able to get on.
[00:18:51.433 --> 00:19:02.516]  It'll all just be O'Neill, sour grapes, and now when anybody talks about the White House's plan to attack Iraq before they even got into office, it'll be, oh, that's just from that O'Neill.
[00:19:02.856 --> 00:19:04.197]  You've got sour grapes.
[00:19:05.997 --> 00:19:07.818]  This is how their propaganda works.
[00:19:08.487 --> 00:19:20.135]  The news will focus in on evidence that cannot be totally proven while ignoring a sea of real smoking gun, red flag, incontrovertible documentation.
[00:19:21.416 --> 00:19:22.377]  And so that's the reality.
[00:19:22.417 --> 00:19:31.023]  It's like cops going into Jeffrey Dahmer's house and ignoring the refrigerator full of body parts, looking at it, closing it, and saying, you can go free, sir.
[00:19:31.424 --> 00:19:35.927]  I don't see any evidence of what your neighbor says about you.
[00:19:37.495 --> 00:19:42.859]  So the police are focusing on the neighbor of Jeffrey Dahmer instead of going into his refrigerator.
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:45.822]  Well, we've been into the refrigerator of the White House.
[00:19:46.222 --> 00:19:48.104]  We know the horrors that are in there.
[00:19:49.084 --> 00:19:49.805]  It's on the record.
[00:19:51.246 --> 00:19:52.327]  Okay.
[00:19:52.367 --> 00:19:53.768]  You can comment on that if you like.
[00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:59.333]  There's more on O'Neill, more stuff O'Neill talks about that is a little more important.
[00:19:59.933 --> 00:20:01.675]  Tribes find chemical weapons in Iraq.
[00:20:01.695 --> 00:20:03.256]  They're now claiming we'll go over that.
[00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:05.440]  And just a ton of other news.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.421]  Big show lined up for you today.
[00:20:11.743 --> 00:20:15.945]  Hi, this is Jack Browning with a special offer to listeners of GCN Radio.
[00:20:16.225 --> 00:20:23.088]  Use the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights for your good, not the good of manipulating government agencies.
[00:20:23.476 --> 00:20:24.978]  Take control of your own destiny.
[00:20:25.158 --> 00:20:29.604]  GCN is contracted with Midas Resources for copies of The Citizen's Rulebook.
[00:20:29.804 --> 00:20:31.086]  This is more than a handbook.
[00:20:31.246 --> 00:20:34.570]  It is your guide to a freer life with less governmental interference.
[00:20:34.969 --> 00:20:35.669]  Here's the deal.
[00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:47.152]  Call MRI at 800-686-2237 and obtain two handbooks, one for yourself, one for a friend, and two silver dollars for just $24.95, shipping included.
[00:20:47.392 --> 00:20:53.674]  More than half these coins were melted under the Pittman Act of 1918 and later with a great silver run of the 70s and 80s.
[00:20:54.774 --> 00:20:59.595]  There are less than one of these coins surviving for every 20 persons in the United States.
[00:20:59.935 --> 00:21:01.876]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[00:21:04.156 --> 00:21:06.017]  Ask for the Freedom Handbook Special.
[00:21:06.397 --> 00:21:07.977]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[00:21:08.097 --> 00:21:09.958]  Thank you.
[00:21:10.018 --> 00:21:13.379]  Hey, John Sattler here, and I have a question for you.
[00:21:13.599 --> 00:21:15.119]  Are you having an energy crisis?
[00:21:15.459 --> 00:21:18.060]  No, I'm not talking about the rising cost of gasoline.
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.220]  I'm talking about you, personally.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.441]  Do you have the energy you need to do all the things in life that you need to do?
[00:21:23.741 --> 00:21:25.522]  If you're like most people, the answer is no.
[00:21:25.882 --> 00:21:29.642]  And that extra cup of coffee or an afternoon candy bar is not the solution.
[00:21:29.982 --> 00:21:32.843]  There's a safe and effective way to energize your life naturally.
[00:21:33.123 --> 00:21:35.164]  It's called Be Alive Royal Jelly.
[00:21:35.524 --> 00:21:38.804]  If you haven't tried it yet, you're missing out on one of nature's best-kept secrets.
[00:21:39.184 --> 00:21:46.586]  Made naturally in a beehive, not manufactured in a lab, Royal Jelly is used by people around the world for energy, vitality, and stamina.
[00:21:46.766 --> 00:21:46.806]  866-321-1900
[00:22:11.267 --> 00:22:15.151]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:22:15.391 --> 00:22:20.816]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:22:21.116 --> 00:22:31.465]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:22:31.645 --> 00:22:35.969]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:44.514]  Trihalomethane and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:22:44.794 --> 00:22:51.098]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:22:51.258 --> 00:22:51.498]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:23:11.397 --> 00:23:14.939]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:15.600]  Yes.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:20.683]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood, the richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[00:23:20.804 --> 00:23:29.730]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, two ounces of juice have the same nutrition as three pounds of choice garden produce.
[00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:37.595]  The get-up-and-go energy, healing, blood building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.
[00:23:37.815 --> 00:23:40.017]  Hi, I'm Alan Davison at Monocot Wheatgrass.
[00:23:40.217 --> 00:23:42.858]  Thank you for your support of our labors and of this network.
[00:24:17.225 --> 00:24:21.188]  All right, your calls are coming up here momentarily at 800-259-9231.
[00:24:21.208 --> 00:24:26.453]  And then, troops find chemical weapons in Iraq.
[00:24:26.553 --> 00:24:29.756]  Bush sought way to invade Iraq even before election.
[00:24:30.156 --> 00:24:33.499]  Border Council calls Bush plan slap in the face.
[00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:36.882]  Errant email shames RFID backer.
[00:24:38.141 --> 00:24:50.264]  They were asking Catherine Albrecht, the lady fighting the tracker chips, one of the leading fighters of that control system, they accidentally sent her an email because they've been contacting her for a bio.
[00:24:51.244 --> 00:25:06.407]  One of the people from the big RFID company that works for Gillette had sent her an email she'd sent to someone inside the corporation, accidentally sent her whole bundle of emails to her about ways to destroy her.
[00:25:07.236 --> 00:25:08.838]  They're trying to dig dirt up on her.
[00:25:09.578 --> 00:25:12.280]  Oh, RFID, such a sweet, nice thing.
[00:25:12.841 --> 00:25:29.075]  A microchip embedded in every product that tracks it from the factory to the warehouse to the store to your home with your name on it from the store to the landfill, part of the new sales tax, national sales tax, world sales tax system.
[00:25:30.803 --> 00:25:43.414]  Also, working in plain sight out of the San Diego Union Tribune, even they admit that there's almost zero enforcement of illegal aliens working inside major corporations.
[00:25:43.554 --> 00:25:53.003]  And it says that since four or five months ago when they raided and arrested 300 at Walmart, there had been no other arrest nationwide.
[00:25:53.303 --> 00:25:55.145]  That was simply a staged event.
[00:25:56.881 --> 00:25:57.863]  And much more.
[00:25:58.003 --> 00:26:02.509]  Amendment to CCB would detain UK citizens without trial.
[00:26:02.529 --> 00:26:08.378]  They're now passing martial law provisions and legislations in England.
[00:26:09.395 --> 00:26:10.656]  And a lot more.
[00:26:10.676 --> 00:26:21.900]  There's also a reward issued in the hit-and-run murder of a chemist and microbiologist who was killed in that medical center last month.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.061]  Obviously a murder for hire.
[00:26:24.141 --> 00:26:28.123]  They ran over him and then backed back over him, jumping the sidewalk.
[00:26:28.983 --> 00:26:31.704]  So that's part of what's coming up as well.
[00:26:32.124 --> 00:26:35.445]  But right now, let's talk to Art in Kansas City.
[00:26:35.625 --> 00:26:36.326]  Art, you're on the air.
[00:26:36.366 --> 00:26:36.726]  Go ahead.
[00:26:37.475 --> 00:26:38.236]  Hello, Alex.
[00:26:38.396 --> 00:26:43.380]  I just wanted to remind you that they've had race-specific bioweapons for at least 50 years.
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.882]  Don't you remember the Tuskegee experiment?
[00:26:47.303 --> 00:26:49.365]  For those that don't know about that, why don't you tell them?
[00:26:50.065 --> 00:26:55.750]  Well, it was a specific strain of, I believe, syphilis that was introduced to the black population.
[00:26:56.343 --> 00:27:04.091]  Now, when the government first got caught doing that, they said, oh, we just didn't give black men treatment in a study over 45 years.
[00:27:16.603 --> 00:27:28.034]  And we did let them spread it, but now it's come out that yes, indeed, they were giving black men syphilis and then not giving them treatment to study this disease, yes.
[00:27:28.734 --> 00:27:33.799]  It's sort of like the hepatitis B vaccine they released out of the...
[00:27:34.432 --> 00:27:39.034]  And by the way, we have the government documents, official stuff, where they engineered the AIDS virus.
[00:27:39.454 --> 00:27:40.275]  That is not debatable.
[00:27:40.295 --> 00:27:41.715]  That is documented historical fact.
[00:27:41.755 --> 00:27:43.616]  And for those that just joined us...
[00:27:58.671 --> 00:28:05.235]  Dick Cheney, in one of the PNAC documents, said we need to legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons.
[00:28:05.675 --> 00:28:10.958]  How can they write documents like that and then not have it be a major media issue?
[00:28:11.238 --> 00:28:14.180]  It's been in the London Guardian, for my knowledge, and that's it.
[00:28:15.592 --> 00:28:18.994]  I haven't seen it anywhere else, Alex, but I appreciate you bringing it out.
[00:28:19.375 --> 00:28:21.256]  God bless you, and God bless America.
[00:28:21.536 --> 00:28:22.557]  God bless you, my friend.
[00:28:22.717 --> 00:28:26.659]  And understand, it's not just, oh, it's just the London Guardian saying it.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.741]  I went to the PNAC document.
[00:28:28.861 --> 00:28:29.561]  It is there.
[00:28:30.062 --> 00:28:30.902]  They say it.
[00:28:31.403 --> 00:28:35.605]  It's documented fact, but only the London Guardian has written an article about it.
[00:28:36.926 --> 00:28:37.987]  Ask yourself that question.
[00:28:38.047 --> 00:28:38.287]  Why?
[00:28:39.108 --> 00:28:40.409]  Joe in New York, go ahead.
[00:28:40.969 --> 00:28:43.891]  Hey, Alex, just in case your listeners are not aware of this stuff,
[00:28:44.363 --> 00:28:50.807]  There's a woman, because I know you mentioned it a few times, but just to state my statement, I'd just like to reiterate a little bit.
[00:28:51.207 --> 00:28:57.471]  There's a woman, Ellen Mariani, that's actually suing the Bush administration because she lost a husband in the 9-11 event.
[00:28:58.452 --> 00:29:12.460]  And David Chippes, which is also an attorney in Washington, D.C., happened to receive, I believe, federal documents claiming that the Bush administration knew several weeks before the 9-11 event, and he tried to
[00:29:13.117 --> 00:29:17.341]  Calling the Bush administration on the phone, and basically, he was stonewalled.
[00:29:17.521 --> 00:29:19.082]  Yeah, we had David Shippers on the show.
[00:29:19.283 --> 00:29:19.483]  Right.
[00:29:19.523 --> 00:29:26.129]  My question is, how come you don't hear anything about David Shippers getting in contact with Ellen Mariani?
[00:29:28.471 --> 00:29:29.252]  Oh, he has.
[00:29:29.912 --> 00:29:30.493]  Oh, he has?
[00:29:30.673 --> 00:29:32.275]  Yeah, all these folks have been talking.
[00:29:32.315 --> 00:29:32.575]  Look.
[00:29:34.477 --> 00:29:34.977]  Okay, in late 2000 and...
[00:29:38.467 --> 00:29:39.408]  I'd like to hold on, Alex.
[00:29:39.528 --> 00:29:40.209]  I'd like to hold on.
[00:29:40.289 --> 00:29:40.909]  Yeah, sure.
[00:29:40.989 --> 00:29:41.650]  Sure, stay there.
[00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:53.500]  In late 2002, David Shippers, Larry Klayman of Judicial Watch, FBI agent Robert Wright, stood up the National Press Club and said, we were going to have a press conference, but we can't.
[00:29:53.901 --> 00:29:59.305]  Here's a letter from the Justice Department saying we'll be arrested if we tell you what we know.
[00:30:00.026 --> 00:30:01.147]  Talk about a cover-up.
[00:30:02.528 --> 00:30:03.429]  We're on the march.
[00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:05.431]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:06.437 --> 00:30:09.198]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:12.278 --> 00:30:17.799]  Whether you live in the country or simply dream about living in the country, Countryside and Small Stock Journal is the magazine for you.
[00:30:17.999 --> 00:30:30.422]  You'll learn how to make cheese, sausage, wine, soap, and more, build a cider press, a year-round greenhouse, or even your own home, raise and care for poultry, rabbits, sheep, and goats, and cook delicious meals from scratch with food grown in your own backyard.
[00:30:30.542 --> 00:30:32.682]  With Countryside, you'll learn handy gardening tricks,
[00:30:32.862 --> 00:30:35.764]  We'll rush you the latest issue of Countryside without cost or obligation.
[00:30:35.804 --> 00:30:36.905]  That's 1-800-551-5691 to get your free issue.
[00:30:36.985 --> 00:30:39.567]  If you like what you see, pay the invoice and enjoy Countryside for a full year.
[00:30:39.607 --> 00:30:43.390]  If you decide it's not for you, simply write cancel on the invoice but keep the magazine just for taking a look.
[00:31:01.943 --> 00:31:02.784]  It's as simple as that.
[00:31:03.004 --> 00:31:04.125]  Get ready to live the good life
[00:31:12.441 --> 00:31:13.041]  We're good to go.
[00:31:13.061 --> 00:31:13.542]  We're good to go.
[00:31:38.738 --> 00:31:40.700]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.

[00:31:54.954 --> 00:31:55.434]  That's right.

[00:32:12.428 --> 00:32:16.031]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[00:32:16.071 --> 00:32:17.652]  I've tried many, many products.
[00:32:17.832 --> 00:32:20.074]  I have never experienced anything like collagenate.
[00:32:20.574 --> 00:32:24.377]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than eight weeks.
[00:32:24.817 --> 00:32:25.478]  It truly works.
[00:32:25.902 --> 00:32:27.082]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[00:32:27.462 --> 00:32:33.403]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through collagenate from Vim and Vigor.

[00:32:39.985 --> 00:32:44.005]  Our listeners keep telling us Vim and Vigor's collagenate really does work.
[00:32:44.365 --> 00:32:45.426]  It's healthy for you, too.
[00:32:45.806 --> 00:32:53.287]  In addition to helping you lose weight, collagenate is also designed to improve strength and health of muscles, joints, skin, hair, and nails.

[00:33:01.093 --> 00:33:01.454]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[00:33:01.474 --> 00:33:01.574]  Music
[00:33:22.839 --> 00:33:38.709]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2, back from 9 to midnight central, we do this show as we blast out on the AM and FM dial from Los Angeles, California to Rhode Island, Providence, Rhode Island, from Austin, Texas to Kansas City, Missouri.
[00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:43.112]  We also simulcast on Global Shortwave at 12.172 and 93.20 from 9 to midnight central.
[00:33:48.297 --> 00:33:48.398]  5.085 and 6890.
[00:33:48.478 --> 00:33:49.960]  The daytime frequency is 12.172 and 9320 from 11 to 2.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.124]  Also, you can always listen at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:02.336 --> 00:34:07.100]  We go out on two digital satellites, ABC and Clear Channel.
[00:34:07.621 --> 00:34:08.922]  We lease feeds on those.
[00:34:09.683 --> 00:34:13.926]  We have two analog feeds, Galaxy 1 and now Galaxy 13.
[00:34:14.467 --> 00:34:19.832]  And that new satellite that's replacing Galaxy 9 is at GCNlive.com.
[00:34:21.133 --> 00:34:30.281]  Okay, before I go back to Joe and Charles and Mark and Jim and others, last week I mentioned
[00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:35.031]  The fact that Bush is scheduled on Wednesday.
[00:34:35.751 --> 00:34:41.032]  Now, he was scheduled last month on the 100th anniversary of powered flight to announce it.
[00:34:41.373 --> 00:34:58.437]  He suspended that announcement for the time being, but they're saying yet again in the Associated Press that Bush this Wednesday is going to announce a new moon mission, going back to the moon, and a first-time mission by human beings to Mars.
[00:35:00.495 --> 00:35:04.938]  I guess trying to relive the announcements of John F. Kennedy.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.582]  So if listeners want to comment on this, we really haven't had a discussion of it.
[00:35:10.642 --> 00:35:12.243]  I've read a few articles about it.
[00:35:12.283 --> 00:35:13.384]  I find it very interesting.
[00:35:13.725 --> 00:35:15.806]  I'd like to get your take on it and what you think about it.
[00:35:15.846 --> 00:35:17.807]  Is it a good idea, a bad idea?
[00:35:18.388 --> 00:35:20.229]  Why do you think Bush is scheduled to do this?
[00:35:20.329 --> 00:35:21.710]  What do you think of NASA?
[00:35:22.471 --> 00:35:23.912]  And, of course, I've got my own comments.
[00:35:24.192 --> 00:35:26.634]  We've got Paul Watson joining us in about an hour.
[00:35:27.657 --> 00:35:30.379]  And he'll be with us for 30 minutes or more with a report.
[00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:36.304]  And then the last 30 minutes of the show, we've got Jack Foote from Ranch Rescue coming on.
[00:35:36.344 --> 00:35:54.638]  That's the group that goes down and documents the open borders and tries to protect people's ranches from the thousands in some cases per ranch per week of illegals that are trespassing and vandalizing and robbing and raping and killing in some cases, including Border Patrol agents, even killing them, forestry agents, you name it.
[00:35:55.078 --> 00:36:01.985]  They were shot at by Mexican troops and this made headlines in a few papers around the country, but didn't get the attention it should.
[00:36:02.045 --> 00:36:02.846]  We covered it here.
[00:36:03.447 --> 00:36:06.169]  We'll be going over that with Jack Foote as well.
[00:36:07.511 --> 00:36:15.539]  Also, Paul O'Neill, the Treasury Secretary, in a new book says Bush planned to go into Iraq day one when he first got to the White House.
[00:36:16.212 --> 00:36:21.058]  We have Bush during the campaign, and when he first got into office, saying, we'll never go into these countries.
[00:36:21.098 --> 00:36:22.880]  I'm against going into foreign lands.
[00:36:23.661 --> 00:36:25.663]  Bill Clinton was bad because he did that.
[00:36:25.803 --> 00:36:26.664]  I'll never do it.
[00:36:27.165 --> 00:36:30.248]  Then Bush said, oh, we're now going to do this because of 9-11.
[00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:31.730]  I'm changing my mind.
[00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:33.312]  And folks said, well, that's fair.
[00:36:33.672 --> 00:36:34.754]  He's trying to protect us.
[00:36:35.374 --> 00:36:36.955]  Folks, it was all premeditated.
[00:36:37.395 --> 00:36:45.417]  Their own PNAC documents from 2000 said, terrorism is needed to get the people behind invading a host of countries.
[00:36:45.817 --> 00:36:51.799]  And they listed 63, with Iraq, Syria, and Iran 1, 2, and 3.
[00:36:52.339 --> 00:36:53.960]  Then Somalia, number 4.
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:55.360]  Libya, number 5.
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:57.861]  Perhaps even Egypt.
[00:36:58.761 --> 00:36:59.761]  It goes on and on.
[00:36:59.882 --> 00:37:01.282]  North Korea, China.
[00:37:02.668 --> 00:37:09.433]  And that's why they've got the draft being lined back up and the draft boards being set up again three months ago.
[00:37:10.153 --> 00:37:11.835]  So I'd also like to discuss this.
[00:37:11.875 --> 00:37:20.901]  I've got a bunch of Second Amendment news, more on the open borders and Bush trying to totally surrender and capitulate to the invaders.
[00:37:21.462 --> 00:37:22.422]  We'll be going over that.
[00:37:22.502 --> 00:37:27.386]  But Joe in New York only had about a minute in the last segment, so I'm bringing him back up.
[00:37:28.206 --> 00:37:28.847]  He mentioned...
[00:37:30.288 --> 00:37:40.055]  Some of the widows of 9-11 victims, one in particular saying Bush was behind it, the documents coming out, and he was saying why hasn't David Shippers done more on this?
[00:37:40.456 --> 00:37:43.198]  The man that impeached Bill Clinton, brought down the mob in Chicago.
[00:37:43.578 --> 00:37:45.399]  We had him on two weeks after 9-11.
[00:37:45.439 --> 00:37:48.662]  He'd been on the record saying terrorists are going to attack New York.
[00:37:48.842 --> 00:37:49.582]  I know how.
[00:37:50.003 --> 00:37:51.364]  He tried to warn the White House.
[00:37:51.404 --> 00:37:52.485]  They wouldn't talk to him.
[00:37:52.745 --> 00:37:53.846]  Tried to warn Ashcroft.
[00:37:54.226 --> 00:37:56.548]  And the answer, why you don't hear from Shippers now,
[00:37:57.368 --> 00:38:05.898]  Is Shippers and Larry Klayman of Judicial Watch and FBI Agent Robert Wright, who had evidence ten times more damning than Kathleen Rowley?
[00:38:06.826 --> 00:38:11.888]  We're told you'll be arrested if you talk any more about any of this and what you know.
[00:38:12.188 --> 00:38:18.430]  They held the letters up at the National Press Club, and the FBI just started crying and saying, I love America.
[00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:20.031]  I didn't know it was this bad.
[00:38:20.411 --> 00:38:21.491]  I can't tell you.
[00:38:22.031 --> 00:38:27.653]  And then Klayman shoves him aside and says, all I can say is, the Bushes vacationed with the Bin Ladens.
[00:38:28.754 --> 00:38:30.394]  Okay, and they all had tears in their eyes.
[00:38:30.474 --> 00:38:32.775]  So they know what we know.
[00:38:33.735 --> 00:38:35.016]  Let's go back to Joe.
[00:38:35.116 --> 00:38:35.736]  Joe, go ahead.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.442]  Yeah, but Alex, how can they actually enforce that?
[00:38:38.562 --> 00:38:44.746]  Because there is really no law that can actually prosecute them if they do any legal act.
[00:38:45.927 --> 00:38:47.188]  Because it's unlawfully to begin with.
[00:38:47.248 --> 00:38:52.993]  Any law that they try to say is a law that's unlawful isn't a law, so they really can't prosecute them.
[00:38:53.013 --> 00:38:58.797]  Well, they shouldn't be able to use the Patriot Act to go after Rush Limbaugh or dope smokers.
[00:38:59.197 --> 00:38:59.758]  Exactly.
[00:38:59.878 --> 00:39:01.219]  But they are doing it, sir.
[00:39:03.959 --> 00:39:07.342]  I know if I had that evidence, which I do, I'm going to talk about it.
[00:39:07.702 --> 00:39:15.990]  But these guys did go far, did speak out, did get involved, and Robert Wright, the senior FBI agent, started crying.
[00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:17.591]  And he said, look,
[00:39:18.286 --> 00:39:19.326]  He said, he started crying.
[00:39:43.596 --> 00:39:45.317]  Well, that's just ridiculous.
[00:39:45.437 --> 00:39:49.921]  The other comment I want to make real quick is you mentioned something about biological racial weapons.
[00:39:50.701 --> 00:39:51.702]  That's nothing really new.
[00:39:51.762 --> 00:39:54.704]  I mean, how many times have you heard in the media about ethnic cleansing?
[00:39:55.205 --> 00:39:56.425]  It's just another word, Alex.
[00:39:57.146 --> 00:39:59.007]  Same thing that's been going on for so many years.
[00:39:59.027 --> 00:40:01.189]  Yeah, that's what different tribes do to each other.
[00:40:01.229 --> 00:40:08.754]  But the point is, we know Joseph Mingula, the Nazi doctor, the scientist, was working on ways to kill all Jews.
[00:40:08.774 --> 00:40:09.175]  Mind control.
[00:40:12.185 --> 00:40:14.567]  Major mind control and things like that as well.
[00:40:14.587 --> 00:40:18.189]  Major mind control, and he was hired by the CIA, protected, brought over here.
[00:40:18.489 --> 00:40:19.910]  That's even admitted on the History Channel.
[00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:32.797]  But Dick Cheney comes out and says we need to legitimize, this is a quote, we need to legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons in theater operations in the next century.
[00:40:33.257 --> 00:40:33.758]  This was in 2000.
[00:40:34.118 --> 00:40:34.398]  Okay.
[00:40:35.018 --> 00:40:36.799]  Well, it was released in 2000.
[00:40:36.899 --> 00:40:38.020]  It had been written in late 99.
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:38.120]  So...
[00:40:40.427 --> 00:40:42.809]  Again, why isn't that a major news item?
[00:40:42.869 --> 00:40:47.152]  We have the Vice President talking about ethnic cleansing weapons.
[00:40:50.694 --> 00:40:51.055]  Joe?
[00:40:51.215 --> 00:40:52.216]  Are you asking me a question?
[00:40:52.296 --> 00:40:53.316]  Yes, I'm asking you a question.
[00:40:53.356 --> 00:40:53.857]  I'm sorry.
[00:40:54.477 --> 00:40:56.038]  Can you just repeat that question again?
[00:40:56.479 --> 00:41:06.646]  I'm asking you, how does it affect you to know that Dick Cheney wrote this in a public document and it's not a major news issue?
[00:41:08.103 --> 00:41:12.747]  Well, it affects me a lot, but I mean, as far as, you know.
[00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:16.291]  All right, thanks for the call.
[00:41:16.671 --> 00:41:17.231]  Thanks for the call.
[00:41:17.251 --> 00:41:18.052]  I appreciate it, Joe.
[00:41:18.673 --> 00:41:19.994]  Mark in Minnesota, go ahead.
[00:41:23.197 --> 00:41:25.179]  Okay, we'll go to Charles in California first.
[00:41:25.259 --> 00:41:26.100]  Charles, go ahead.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:26.800]  Hello.
[00:41:27.121 --> 00:41:27.401]  Yes.
[00:41:28.722 --> 00:41:32.886]  I just wanted to say a few things about this immigration bill.
[00:41:33.439 --> 00:41:33.759]  Yes.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.041]  It looks pretty bad from here.
[00:41:36.101 --> 00:41:39.684]  I mean, this place is already crawling with illegal aliens everywhere you look.
[00:41:40.244 --> 00:41:51.172]  And I'm wondering what's going to be the change in procedure at the borders, say in San Diego now, where they legitimately have guards trying to keep people out.
[00:41:51.472 --> 00:41:53.393]  Are they just going to close those down or what?
[00:41:54.734 --> 00:41:59.698]  Okay, I've read two bills that Bush is saying they're considering.
[00:42:00.251 --> 00:42:08.016]  Okay, the bills that are already introduced, one by John McCain, what John McCain says in the bill is what Bush has proposed.
[00:42:08.237 --> 00:42:09.538]  So that's what they're going with.
[00:42:10.278 --> 00:42:13.600]  And both the bills I've seen are very similar, but basically this is what happens.
[00:42:15.041 --> 00:42:20.965]  They're going to be online job referral websites, you know, the type of sites we've all gone to.
[00:42:21.226 --> 00:42:21.466]  Right.
[00:42:21.706 --> 00:42:22.086]  Okay?
[00:42:22.687 --> 00:42:28.831]  But they're going to be for people in India, Mexico, China, Russia, every country in the world.
[00:42:30.473 --> 00:42:41.640]  Now, companies will sell, and this is what's being discussed, and they already do this with the HP visas.
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:54.988]  They will sell, just for a few dollars in some cases, access to these websites that will then give the illegals a printout saying that there is a job prospect for them.
[00:42:56.150 --> 00:43:07.033]  Then with that piece of paper, see, we already have 800-plus cities accepting matricula cards issued by Chile, Mexico, Poland, and dozens of other countries, okay?
[00:43:07.693 --> 00:43:12.555]  You come in, this fake ID is accepted by cities, police, banks, everybody.
[00:43:13.075 --> 00:43:25.198]  Now we have, to answer your question, Wells Fargo getting an award from Vicente Fox two months ago in Austin for saying that they're going to issue a new smart card
[00:43:26.027 --> 00:43:43.614]  With the illegals' face and Wells Fargo ID number, and cities are saying, the same cities that are saying they'll accept matricula, consular cards, from the country's consulate, they make an ID and then we accept it, not one of our IDs, now you're going to have banks issuing ID cards.
[00:43:43.634 --> 00:43:44.515]  This is already happening.
[00:43:44.855 --> 00:43:46.776]  They're already handing out the awards for this.
[00:43:48.016 --> 00:43:49.977]  Fox is up here thanking them for doing it in Austin.
[00:43:50.709 --> 00:44:02.976]  Now you're going to have these job search websites issuing a piece of paper saying you've got a job or a prospect to interview for it if you come to the U.S.
[00:44:03.677 --> 00:44:12.622]  Bush is saying with that piece of paper, that is the equivalent of a visa to fly in, walk in, come through the border crossing.
[00:44:13.257 --> 00:44:20.859]  So, yes, basically they're saying they're going to get rid of the Border Patrol and simply have it for a drug sweet point where they search your vehicle.
[00:44:21.439 --> 00:44:25.360]  Okay, so this isn't just total legalization of whoever's here.
[00:44:25.881 --> 00:44:28.901]  It's also total legalization of whoever gets here.
[00:44:29.342 --> 00:44:41.105]  But to get to the crossing, you will either show a Wells Fargo bank card issued in Mexico or you will show a matricula consular card that Mexico issues for $23 to anybody that wants one.
[00:44:42.103 --> 00:44:46.366]  Or you show the printout showing you have a prospective job opportunity.
[00:44:48.487 --> 00:44:57.954]  Well, I read in David Icke's book that it said that the reason why the borders aren't being pursued is because all the drugs are coming through there and they don't want those people to be stopped.
[00:44:58.534 --> 00:45:00.895]  Well, again, that's a part of it.
[00:45:00.936 --> 00:45:02.096]  I'd say maybe 10% of it.
[00:45:02.436 --> 00:45:04.478]  It's about driving down the wages...
[00:45:05.282 --> 00:45:06.583]  They've already done that.
[00:45:06.803 --> 00:45:08.924]  They've already done the wages thing.
[00:45:08.944 --> 00:45:20.391]  Well, sir, if you think it's going to drop now, high-tech layoffs are going to get seven times worse over the next four years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
[00:45:20.912 --> 00:45:29.377]  Well, I was listening to that ranch rescue guy on the National Alliance show, and it's, like, pathetic that the government...
[00:45:29.804 --> 00:45:34.765]  It won't even help these poor people that are volunteering to try to keep these people out.
[00:45:34.785 --> 00:45:40.786]  It's like a dam bursting on their private property, and the government doesn't help them at all.
[00:45:40.806 --> 00:45:48.287]  They're asking for donations, which is pretty pathetic if that's the kind of border we have.
[00:45:49.187 --> 00:45:50.408]  I think that's in Texas.
[00:45:50.888 --> 00:45:51.228]  All right.
[00:45:51.248 --> 00:45:52.448]  Well, thank you for the call.
[00:45:53.008 --> 00:45:57.629]  I know Jack Foote, and Jack Foote is no – I've talked to him many times on the phone.
[00:45:57.669 --> 00:45:58.469]  He's not a racist.
[00:45:59.518 --> 00:46:04.441]  And I would imagine he didn't know what show he was going on if he went on the National Alliance show.
[00:46:06.042 --> 00:46:16.708]  I mean, the National Alliance brings up real issues like the open border, but then the media can point their cameras at them, who also have a Nazi philosophy, and then discredit trying to control the borders.
[00:46:16.788 --> 00:46:18.509]  And boy, that is the wrong direction to go to.
[00:46:18.549 --> 00:46:24.672]  We'll ask Jack about that when he gets on the show, if he did indeed do that interview.
[00:46:26.744 --> 00:46:28.485]  But I guess I'd be interviewed by anybody.
[00:46:28.585 --> 00:46:29.786]  I've been interviewed by the leftists.
[00:46:29.826 --> 00:46:31.147]  I've been interviewed by the right-wingers.
[00:46:31.167 --> 00:46:33.189]  I've been interviewed by the foreign countries.
[00:46:33.249 --> 00:46:36.912]  I just want to talk to people and try to turn them to my way of thinking.
[00:46:36.952 --> 00:46:41.716]  But a very interesting call there, Charles.
[00:46:41.776 --> 00:46:51.183]  Before we go to Mark and Jim and Rich and others, I hate to repeat stuff, but a lot of times I hear my show and rebroadcast on the weekend and
[00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:52.630]  All of this...
[00:47:17.535 --> 00:47:29.006]  While at the same time they're telling us, give up your liberties, we're going to scan and watch and listen to everything you do and put cameras up in all your neighborhoods because the terrorists are going to get us.
[00:47:29.387 --> 00:47:36.073]  Meanwhile, private companies can issue ID cards that are accepted by the cities, most of the cities.
[00:47:36.954 --> 00:47:39.917]  I mean, can I go start a company and issue ID cards?
[00:47:39.997 --> 00:47:40.998]  No, I'd be arrested.
[00:47:41.781 --> 00:47:42.461]  And I should be.
[00:47:42.901 --> 00:47:48.944]  But if I was a big fat cat Wells Fargo doing this for the globalists, it'd be just fine.
[00:47:50.364 --> 00:48:02.329]  I mean, Vicente Fox came to Austin and gave an award to the APD for not following the federal law and for not arresting illegal aliens.
[00:48:02.849 --> 00:48:04.689]  That was in our newspaper, on the news.
[00:48:04.749 --> 00:48:08.511]  He gave a speech at the Capitol thanking them for this.
[00:48:09.725 --> 00:48:11.305]  And gave awards to the police department.
[00:48:11.585 --> 00:48:20.448]  Can you imagine if I went to Mexico and gave their police an award for not following the law?
[00:48:20.728 --> 00:48:21.668]  I'd be arrested.
[00:48:21.988 --> 00:48:23.168]  What are you, crazy?
[00:48:24.749 --> 00:48:35.471]  Imagine if I went down to Mexico and I said, here's an award for not asking for ID cards of Americans and not asking for passports and letting Americans come down here and do whatever they want.
[00:48:36.491 --> 00:48:38.852]  I'd be a laughingstock behind bars.
[00:48:39.989 --> 00:48:42.731]  But it happens here, and it's a good thing.
[00:48:43.132 --> 00:48:48.196]  See how all this ridiculous, out-of-control stuff is just right out in the open?
[00:48:49.717 --> 00:48:50.838]  It's just right out in the open.
[00:48:51.359 --> 00:48:58.464]  A foreign head of state here lobbying our state, giving awards, thanking our state for not following the law.
[00:48:58.905 --> 00:49:00.646]  That is an enemy attack.
[00:49:02.027 --> 00:49:03.729]  That is a usurper.
[00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:06.171]  That's amazing.
[00:49:06.954 --> 00:49:13.896]  And Bush is in Mexico right now with Vicente Fox steamrolling the deal to get rid of our borders.
[00:49:15.577 --> 00:49:18.598]  And understand, folks, you can't get a telemarketing job.
[00:49:18.638 --> 00:49:20.218]  You can't get a customer service job.
[00:49:20.498 --> 00:49:31.261]  I was watching 60 Minutes last night, not just a Paul O'Neill announcement about Bush planning to go into Iraq from the first days of being in office, contrary to his public speeches at the time.
[00:49:32.382 --> 00:49:36.063]  But then I saw a show about immigration, and it was actually kind of, you know, happy-go-lucky.
[00:49:36.123 --> 00:49:36.403]  Well...
[00:49:37.344 --> 00:49:38.745]  You know, it's a good thing.
[00:49:39.626 --> 00:49:51.475]  Well, there's these call centers in India, and now you're more often when you call for customer service to talk to somebody in India who's been trained to sound like an American than you'll be talking to a citizen.
[00:49:53.156 --> 00:49:57.419]  You know, this is a good thing, and man, it's wonderful, and it gives you cheaper prices.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:06.947]  They even talked about something that I've reported on, but it's hard to believe, that most of the 50 states, when you call about your welfare benefits,
[00:50:07.993 --> 00:50:12.336]  The person that decides if you get more welfare, you're talking to somebody in India.
[00:50:13.136 --> 00:50:14.497]  Now, folks, there should be a law.
[00:50:14.537 --> 00:50:19.020]  We're going to have this big government bureaucracy, okay, which is bad enough.
[00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:19.800]  It's just dependent.
[00:50:20.521 --> 00:50:27.345]  At least the people on the other end of the phone at the welfare center, at least some of that money should go into the U.S.
[00:50:27.385 --> 00:50:29.827]  economy with government jobs.
[00:50:29.867 --> 00:50:33.549]  I mean, I can't believe I'm saying this, but it's better than it going to India.
[00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:37.841]  And they're laying off government jobs here, folks.
[00:50:38.701 --> 00:50:39.921]  And they're going to India.
[00:50:39.941 --> 00:50:44.463]  I mean, we're not even, folks, for a long time people in government thought, well, I'll be safe.
[00:50:45.423 --> 00:50:46.223]  No, you won't.
[00:50:47.223 --> 00:50:49.864]  You're not even going to be safe with a government job.
[00:50:50.604 --> 00:50:51.505]  And yes, it's true.
[00:50:52.025 --> 00:50:54.485]  They're now doing telemarketing out of prisons.
[00:50:54.565 --> 00:50:55.886]  That's a big booming industry.
[00:50:56.246 --> 00:50:59.967]  Prisoners, Indians, but not law-abiding citizens.
[00:51:00.871 --> 00:51:09.256]  Again, illegal aliens come here, they get their green card, even if they're illegal, and they get seven to ten years tax exemption to open a business.
[00:51:09.576 --> 00:51:10.977]  Why don't citizens get that?
[00:51:12.318 --> 00:51:16.620]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:21.183]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:24.338 --> 00:51:33.160]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:40.142]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:40.282 --> 00:51:42.283]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:42.703 --> 00:51:52.990]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:53.290 --> 00:51:58.654]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[00:52:34.737 --> 00:52:39.703]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:52:40.023 --> 00:52:44.028]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.

[00:54:15.498 --> 00:54:15.978]  Don't worry.
[00:54:16.478 --> 00:54:18.019]  This show is documented.
[00:54:18.519 --> 00:54:21.279]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:25.200]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:29.701]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:54:30.242 --> 00:54:39.624]  And my friends, we're about to go back to Mark and Rick and Howard and Maggie and others that are patiently holding the toll-free number to join us.
[00:54:39.744 --> 00:54:40.784]  Wide open phones, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:45.945 --> 00:54:50.147]  Coming up, Blair admits weapons of mass destruction may never be found.
[00:54:50.167 --> 00:54:59.952]  And this report's from two days ago, but that's the same day that the headline read, Proops find chemical weapons in Iraq.
[00:55:00.813 --> 00:55:06.816]  Dozens of mortar rounds containing chemical weapons have been found buried under a road in southern Iraq.
[00:55:06.856 --> 00:55:08.537]  It was revealed last night.
[00:55:09.938 --> 00:55:17.681]  Test of suspicious liquid that were leaking from the shells found that it was a form of blister gas, which include mustard gas.
[00:55:17.822 --> 00:55:23.204]  Now, that's not a weapon of mass destruction by the real definition.
[00:55:23.284 --> 00:55:29.807]  It's a World War I-style weapon, but can we even believe this announcement?
[00:55:29.847 --> 00:55:33.068]  Well, I tend to believe it because we know that's something Saddam made a lot of.
[00:55:33.708 --> 00:55:39.311]  And again, there were hundreds of declared sites that don't count around Iraq
[00:55:39.986 --> 00:55:48.351]  And it's pretty easy to go to one of these sites, get these mortar rounds, and bury them, and then discover them.
[00:55:48.852 --> 00:55:57.617]  I mean, how do you find mortar shells buried under a road by accident in a giant country a lot bigger than the size of Texas?
[00:55:59.098 --> 00:56:01.519]  But again, we know Saddam has weapons of mass destruction.
[00:56:01.539 --> 00:56:02.420]  That was never debatable.
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:06.022]  It was undeclared weapons of mass destruction.
[00:56:06.062 --> 00:56:07.203]  And many times in the past,
[00:56:07.822 --> 00:56:09.404]  They will send out their inspectors.
[00:56:09.784 --> 00:56:21.055]  They will go to a site that's already been inspected, announce they found new weapons of mass destruction, and then quietly retract it two days later in the back of the paper saying, oh, that was a site we'd already looked at.
[00:56:21.836 --> 00:56:25.900]  But again, it creates this subconscious belief that they're telling us the truth.
[00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:30.565]  I don't know what to think of this, though, because they're not making a big deal of it in the media.
[00:56:31.903 --> 00:56:35.365]  So we'll get back into that and, of course, your calls here in just a few minutes.
[00:56:35.966 --> 00:56:40.409]  Before I end this hour, though, I've made ten films.
[00:56:41.429 --> 00:56:49.475]  They're very informative, very impressive, very well done, professionally produced, and they expose what the New World Order is and how to stop it.
[00:56:49.555 --> 00:56:52.977]  One of my new films is Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:56:53.604 --> 00:56:56.846]  Two hours, 40 minutes long, very fast-moving.
[00:56:57.207 --> 00:57:14.319]  We go through what the New World Order is, the false left-right paradigm, Patriot Act I and II, Homeland Security, the cashless society control grid, the foreign troops, the concentration camps, the government-run white slavery rings, forced inoculations.
[00:57:15.916 --> 00:57:16.997]  It's a tour de force.
[00:57:17.097 --> 00:57:23.462]  It goes A to Z. If you want one film that will give you a real education on the New World Order, this is it.
[00:57:24.843 --> 00:57:34.351]  Multiple, I'd say ten different examples of government-sponsored terror where government's been caught engaging in terror that we haven't covered in other past films.
[00:57:34.964 --> 00:57:36.145]  Very important video.
[00:57:36.705 --> 00:57:40.428]  $25.95 is the equivalent of three or four videos in one.
[00:57:40.909 --> 00:57:48.234]  But if you get three or more of any of the separate films that are all lengthy and well done, they drop down to $20 apiece.
[00:57:48.254 --> 00:57:53.238]  That's an $18 discount on the three-tape special, a $24 discount on the four-tape special.
[00:57:53.759 --> 00:57:54.760]  I've made ten films.
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:58.102]  My newest film is Matrix of Evil, and it's great as well.
[00:57:58.763 --> 00:58:02.866]  Ron Paul, Cynthia McKinney, Frank Morales, Colonel Roberts, myself.
[00:58:03.849 --> 00:58:08.933]  Throwing out the Patriot Act, full of solutions, the coming depression.
[00:58:08.993 --> 00:58:12.535]  Ron Paul talks about that and how globalists run Washington.
[00:58:13.976 --> 00:58:20.721]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to get these videos or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:28.875 --> 00:58:35.102]  Again, that's 888-253-3139, or simply write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:58:35.142 --> 00:58:38.546]  And I want you to make copies of the films and spread them out.
[00:58:50.757 --> 00:58:54.879]  Get the word out, have an effect, and your purchase also supports this show.
[00:58:55.359 --> 00:58:58.981]  So Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or 888-253-3139.
[00:59:02.737 --> 00:59:05.978]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:59:06.078 --> 00:59:10.219]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:59:10.499 --> 00:59:13.279]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:59:13.479 --> 00:59:15.880]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:24.702]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:59:24.902 --> 00:59:26.242]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:59:26.442 --> 00:59:30.623]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:59:30.943 --> 00:59:31.444]  We're good to go.
[00:59:58.095 --> 00:59:58.816]  Big Brother.
[01:00:09.895 --> 01:00:10.936]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:11.656 --> 01:00:12.736]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:13.397 --> 01:00:14.217]  You want answers?
[01:00:14.997 --> 01:00:16.918]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:16.938 --> 01:00:20.360]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:24.842]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.843 --> 01:00:27.823]  All right, my friends.
[01:00:27.943 --> 01:00:33.806]  We're now into Hour 2 of this 12th day of January 04.
[01:00:34.286 --> 01:00:38.008]  We've got Paul Joseph Watson to talk about the
[01:00:39.332 --> 01:00:39.892]  We're good to go.
[01:00:39.912 --> 01:00:40.132]  I think?
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:00:59.181]  Alex, how are you doing?
[01:00:59.202 --> 01:00:59.422]  Good, sir.
[01:01:21.315 --> 01:01:27.157]  And I've got a new report here from more scientists saying it's a dangerous vaccine.
[01:01:27.857 --> 01:01:37.739]  Now, what's interesting, Alex, is you notice that it was resumed on Wednesday when Bush announced his big Jobs for Legal Aliens program.
[01:01:38.419 --> 01:01:45.321]  And so everybody, I've been talking to people, everybody seems to think the anthrax vaccine immunization program was faulted.
[01:01:45.981 --> 01:01:47.242]  And it's not going on right now.
[01:01:47.262 --> 01:01:48.762]  A federal judge...
[01:01:49.605 --> 01:01:52.609]  Bush said this is not approved for humans.
[01:01:53.069 --> 01:01:55.872]  You can't make troops take an experimental vaccine.
[01:01:55.892 --> 01:01:57.694]  Now, it's been experimental for 14 years.
[01:01:57.995 --> 01:01:58.675]  They've been giving it.
[01:01:59.256 --> 01:02:05.904]  So Bush says, I want the courts to overturn that
[01:02:06.673 --> 01:02:11.495]  And they wouldn't, so within four days, he told the FDA, okay, go ahead and approve it.
[01:02:11.535 --> 01:02:16.937]  They wouldn't approve it for 14 years, and four days later, they approve it, and it's back in the troops.
[01:02:17.897 --> 01:02:25.759]  In fact, what's interesting, the statute that that decision was based on, in fact, I have a copy of those statutes on my site.
[01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:27.180]  Is that okay if I give that to you?
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.000]  Sure, what's your website?
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:32.282]  It's noanthraxvaccine, all one word, noanthraxvaccine.net.
[01:02:33.142 --> 01:02:36.123]  And actually, I have the executive order that Clinton wrote
[01:02:36.561 --> 01:02:40.624]  1-3-0, 1-3-9, I believe it was, which is a repetition of the statutes.
[01:02:41.285 --> 01:02:50.772]  And they're constructed so loosely that, really, it gives the government the flexibility to come into compliance with the law, no matter what it does, by fiat.
[01:02:51.532 --> 01:02:57.257]  It pretty much says, well, you know, the government can't force troops to take criminal shots unless...
[01:02:57.731 --> 01:03:01.534]  The president signs a waiver, or unless, of course, the FDA says it's okay.
[01:03:01.554 --> 01:03:03.355]  And Bush wouldn't do.
[01:03:03.576 --> 01:03:06.958]  Clinton had the evil nerve to sign that order.
[01:03:07.318 --> 01:03:08.519]  Bush wouldn't reissue it.
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:13.243]  He just told his FDA, which is the sneaky way of doing it, you go ahead and approve that.
[01:03:13.783 --> 01:03:15.184]  Now the president.
[01:03:15.525 --> 01:03:18.067]  Hey, folks, you want a new heart medication that's not approved?
[01:03:18.447 --> 01:03:20.128]  Just ask Bush to say it's approved.
[01:03:20.168 --> 01:03:20.769]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:21.429 --> 01:03:25.030]  Think about the danger, the dictatorial power of that.
[01:03:25.310 --> 01:03:26.671]  Bush is now a doctor.
[01:03:27.171 --> 01:03:36.354]  Bush told the FDA to approve a drug, a vaccine they wouldn't approve for 14 years that admittedly has killed a bunch of troops and made a lot of others sick.
[01:03:37.114 --> 01:03:38.335]  That makes me very angry.
[01:03:39.055 --> 01:03:42.296]  Let's talk to Rick in Tennessee.
[01:03:42.316 --> 01:03:42.736]  Go ahead.
[01:03:43.036 --> 01:03:43.476]  Hello, Alex.
[01:03:43.536 --> 01:03:44.537]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:03:44.577 --> 01:03:44.877]  You bet.
[01:03:45.519 --> 01:04:01.714]  In reference to the new space missions we're having, wasn't it the report from Iron Mountain that talked about disposing some of the population through vaccines and keeping them diverted with unobtainable space-based missions?
[01:04:03.274 --> 01:04:08.759]  Yes, and they admit that much of NASA, about 80% of it, is secret.
[01:04:08.879 --> 01:04:20.229]  Most of it is military, so they can use the funds for a Mars mission, a moon mission, and really use most of that money for clandestine black budget operations.
[01:04:20.810 --> 01:04:22.832]  It's a very evil organization.
[01:04:24.216 --> 01:04:25.197]  That's all I had to say.
[01:04:25.577 --> 01:04:25.958]  All right.
[01:04:26.218 --> 01:04:26.818]  Good points.
[01:04:27.079 --> 01:04:29.541]  And, yes, Bush is scheduled.
[01:04:29.621 --> 01:04:31.302]  Now, he was scheduled to do it last month.
[01:04:31.682 --> 01:04:34.304]  Didn't do it on the 100th anniversary of powered flight.
[01:04:34.885 --> 01:04:40.069]  Bush is scheduled Wednesday to announce we're going back to the moon and to Mars for the first time.
[01:04:41.891 --> 01:04:42.952]  What do you think about that?
[01:04:43.752 --> 01:04:45.414]  Because we covered it, but we didn't discuss it.
[01:04:45.514 --> 01:04:46.735]  It's a big deal.
[01:04:47.515 --> 01:04:51.839]  We'll come back, and we'll go to Howard and Maggie and Spencer and others.
[01:04:52.631 --> 01:04:55.353]  Then I'm going to hit some more of the news and we're getting Paul Watson on.
[01:04:55.933 --> 01:05:01.216]  Then we've got the folks from Ranch Rescue coming on to talk about getting shot at by Mexican troops.
[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:08.061]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[01:05:08.281 --> 01:05:09.702]  If so, hope has arrived.
[01:05:10.182 --> 01:05:11.642]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[01:05:11.903 --> 01:05:17.064]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[01:05:17.424 --> 01:05:21.906]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[01:05:22.226 --> 01:05:30.869]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[01:05:31.369 --> 01:05:32.510]  Gum disease is serious.
[01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:36.731]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[01:05:37.012 --> 01:05:43.634]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including Vitamir toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[01:05:43.975 --> 01:05:48.016]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.

[01:06:03.522 --> 01:06:06.984]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:06:07.264 --> 01:06:10.767]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:06:10.847 --> 01:06:14.789]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:06:15.010 --> 01:06:21.174]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and non-detectable levels.
[01:06:21.594 --> 01:06:29.499]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:06:29.899 --> 01:06:35.244]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:06:35.424 --> 01:06:39.187]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:06:39.548 --> 01:06:41.389]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:06:41.469 --> 01:06:43.631]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:06:43.871 --> 01:06:48.215]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[01:06:57.783 --> 01:07:01.626]  That's 888-803-4438, Protect Your Family.
[01:07:02.246 --> 01:07:06.549]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:07:06.769 --> 01:07:10.572]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World War.
[01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:17.672]  A new world order can emerge.
[01:07:18.893 --> 01:07:23.117]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:07:23.177 --> 01:07:30.104]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:07:30.244 --> 01:07:32.246]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:07:32.646 --> 01:07:42.931]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:07:43.231 --> 01:07:48.614]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:08:08.622 --> 01:08:09.263]  Big Brother.
[01:08:09.923 --> 01:08:11.004]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:11.704 --> 01:08:12.865]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:13.445 --> 01:08:14.286]  You want answers?
[01:08:15.026 --> 01:08:16.947]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:16.967 --> 01:08:20.250]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:20.790 --> 01:08:24.912]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:28.735 --> 01:08:35.159]  In just the last decade, hundreds of prominent people from the Pope,
[01:08:36.161 --> 01:08:58.546]  Two weeks ago, to the President's father, George Herbert Walker Bush, to the heads of academia, mass media, German chancellors, British prime ministers, have called for world government, world taxation, world regulation, world disarmament of the people, gun confiscation.
[01:09:00.067 --> 01:09:00.687]  But still...
[01:09:02.210 --> 01:09:11.775]  The so-called liberals and the so-called conservatives that dominate our media, the neocon hordes, claim there's no such thing as world government.
[01:09:12.035 --> 01:09:18.919]  So let me read four or five famous world government quotes, then we'll go to Howard and Maggie and Spencer and others.
[01:09:19.859 --> 01:09:21.020]  This is David Rockefeller.
[01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:30.665]  But this present window of opportunity during which a truly peaceful and independent world order might be built will not be open for long.
[01:09:31.255 --> 01:09:31.795]  We're good to go.
[01:09:32.096 --> 01:09:32.536]  We're good to go.
[01:09:49.298 --> 01:09:52.679]  In the next century, nations as we know it will be obsolete.
[01:09:53.259 --> 01:09:56.140]  All states will recognize a single global authority.
[01:09:56.700 --> 01:10:00.101]  National sovereignty wasn't such a great idea after all.
[01:10:01.861 --> 01:10:06.583]  President Clinton's Deputy Secretary of State is quoted in Time Magazine, July 20, 1992.
[01:10:06.723 --> 01:10:12.464]  We shall have world government whether you like it or not.
[01:10:13.485 --> 01:10:18.526]  By conquest or consent, statement by Council on Foreign Relations member,
[01:10:19.298 --> 01:10:23.480]  James Warburg to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 17, 1950.
[01:10:25.981 --> 01:10:33.385]  Our task of creating a socialist America can only succeed when those who would resist us have been totally disarmed.
[01:10:34.086 --> 01:10:42.070]  Sarah Brady, Chairman of Handgun Control, to Senator Howard Metzenbaum, the National Educator, January 94, page 3.
[01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:46.632]  That was set on the floor of the Senate, by the way, on C-SPAN.
[01:10:47.228 --> 01:10:58.776]  When we got organized as a country and we wrote a fairly radical Constitution with a radical Bill of Rights, giving a radical amount of individual freedom to Americans, and so a lot of people say there's too much personal freedom.
[01:10:59.491 --> 01:11:02.513]  When personal freedom is being abused, you have to move to limit it.
[01:11:03.013 --> 01:11:13.520]  That's what we did in the announcement I made last weekend on the public housing projects about how we're going to have weapon sweeps and more things like that to try to make people safer in their communities.
[01:11:13.901 --> 01:11:18.263]  President Clinton, March 22, 1994, MTV's Enough is Enough.
[01:11:18.964 --> 01:11:23.187]  We can't be so fixated on our desire to preserve the rights of ordinary Americans.
[01:11:23.627 --> 01:11:26.469]  President Bill Clinton, USA Today, March 11, 1993, page 2A.
[01:11:28.914 --> 01:11:30.155]  The last quote I'm going to read here.
[01:11:30.655 --> 01:11:48.722]  Whatever the price of the Chinese revolution, listen carefully, whatever the price of the Chinese revolution, it has obviously succeeded not only in producing more efficient and dedicated administration, but also in fostering high morale and community of purpose, mass mind control.
[01:11:49.341 --> 01:12:01.948]  The social experiment in China under Chairman Mao's leadership is one of the most important and successful in human history, David Rockefeller's statement in 1973 about Mao Zedong, New York Times, August 10, 1973.
[01:12:04.567 --> 01:12:05.847]  And this is really the last one.
[01:12:06.228 --> 01:12:19.811]  The truth of the matter is that you do have those standby provisions, and the statutory emergency plans are there where you could, in the name of stopping terrorism, apprehend, invoke the military, and arrest Americans and hold them in detention camps.
[01:12:20.372 --> 01:12:20.532]  U.S.
[01:12:20.572 --> 01:12:23.632]  Representative Henry Gonzalez, August 29, 1994.
[01:12:25.293 --> 01:12:32.755]  By the way, I have that video clip of him saying that in Senate hearings about concentration camps.
[01:12:34.771 --> 01:12:36.152]  In the film, The Takeover.
[01:12:36.412 --> 01:12:39.793]  That's about three minutes of that two-hour, five-minute film.
[01:12:40.133 --> 01:12:41.694]  Just to give you an idea of what's in these videos.
[01:12:42.775 --> 01:12:56.321]  But think about David Rockefeller saying for Mao's obituary, writing an obituary for his beloved Mao, who he made so much money with, that, oh, he did such a good job.
[01:12:56.521 --> 01:13:00.362]  Mao killed 50 million people.
[01:13:00.402 --> 01:13:01.783]  The communist Chinese admit that.
[01:13:03.095 --> 01:13:04.016]  50 million.
[01:13:04.076 --> 01:13:08.138]  That is tens of millions more than Adolf Hitler.
[01:13:08.178 --> 01:13:10.179]  The highest estimates of how many people he killed.
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:16.282]  That's counting Jews, Germans, Russians, everybody who got killed due to Hitler's activities.
[01:13:16.983 --> 01:13:19.464]  It's conservatively 25 million or so.
[01:13:20.385 --> 01:13:25.748]  Mao kills 50 million, and they just out in the open, oh, Mao's so good.
[01:13:26.488 --> 01:13:30.110]  And this is who runs the Trilateral Commission, who runs the CFR.
[01:13:30.692 --> 01:13:31.853]  Okay, let's go back to calls.
[01:13:32.533 --> 01:13:36.557]  Let's talk to Howard in Missouri, then we'll go to Maggie and others.
[01:13:36.617 --> 01:13:37.357]  Howard, welcome.
[01:13:37.818 --> 01:13:38.798]  Yes, Alex.
[01:13:38.978 --> 01:13:42.021]  I hope the name of Colin McMillan is never forgotten.
[01:13:42.141 --> 01:13:47.145]  It's going to be just like Vince Foster because, you know, he lived right over by Area 51 over there.
[01:13:47.165 --> 01:13:53.610]  He had several thousand acres, and he was, of course, the appointee to Secretary of Navy by President Bush.
[01:13:53.730 --> 01:13:56.852]  And I just think Mr. Bush is making a big mistake by saying,
[01:13:57.358 --> 01:14:01.822]  Well, of course, he was appointed by President Bush, and then he said he committed suicide, Mr. McMillan, and he was appointed Secretary of the Navy.
[01:14:20.239 --> 01:14:27.561]  And I'll tell you the God's truth, my personal opinion, and if you look at Secretary of Navy now and who's in charge of Nassau, you'll see the same family tree.
[01:14:27.601 --> 01:14:29.421]  It all has to do with Fabian Socialism.
[01:14:30.261 --> 01:14:34.402]  And I think, of course, Mr. Bush is being run by the Communists.
[01:14:34.482 --> 01:14:36.763]  And I can tell you something else.
[01:14:37.023 --> 01:14:44.664]  I told people in Austin, Texas, they was going to kill four of Bush's people before Colin McMillan was, well, they said he committed suicide.
[01:14:44.684 --> 01:14:48.125]  But if you call over to the security over at Austin, Texas,
[01:14:48.905 --> 01:15:07.372]  You'll find out I told them that they were going to kill four of Bush's men, and I don't know how many people they killed in Washington, D.C., but Bush is being pushed around, and if he thinks that he can come up with this Mars program and just forget about Colin McMillan, I'm not going to forget about it.
[01:15:07.392 --> 01:15:08.352]  That's all I'm going to say.
[01:15:08.372 --> 01:15:09.573]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[01:15:09.833 --> 01:15:18.196]  For those that just joined us, Colin McMillan, this is on the record, had had cancer, he had beaten the cancer.
[01:15:19.717 --> 01:15:20.898]  And he had fought it.
[01:15:22.079 --> 01:15:26.521]  And then he gets appointed the head of the Navy and then blows his head off.
[01:15:27.722 --> 01:15:29.623]  And that was last year, middle of last year.
[01:15:31.565 --> 01:15:33.426]  I don't know if that was an assassination.
[01:15:33.526 --> 01:15:34.526]  It may not have been.
[01:15:34.546 --> 01:15:37.588]  I mean, the guy on the record was a Bush minion.
[01:15:38.029 --> 01:15:39.149]  He had had cancer.
[01:15:39.189 --> 01:15:40.450]  He'd gotten cancer again.
[01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:45.113]  So that points towards the fact that he really could have committed suicide.
[01:15:46.013 --> 01:16:02.284]  Now, when you get somebody like Mr. Baxter, who blows his head off in his underwear two blocks from his house, and had just bought a new boat, a new mortgage on a house, and was about to testify against Enron executives, that looks like murder.
[01:16:02.865 --> 01:16:05.446]  The head, Arthur Anderson, accountant.
[01:16:06.507 --> 01:16:10.630]  His decomposing body was found three weeks dead outside Denver.
[01:16:11.626 --> 01:16:15.790]  In the woods, in his car, he shot himself in the head, supposedly.
[01:16:16.190 --> 01:16:20.053]  That, again, looks like a murder.
[01:16:20.994 --> 01:16:24.497]  We know that the woman who was suing Bush, claiming that he had raped her.
[01:16:25.317 --> 01:16:26.759]  I read the news articles.
[01:16:26.939 --> 01:16:28.740]  There have been just a few mainstream articles.
[01:16:29.201 --> 01:16:30.702]  I said, I don't know if that's true or not.
[01:16:31.362 --> 01:16:33.224]  Then she shot herself twice in the head.
[01:16:34.517 --> 01:16:35.718]  So that adds credibility.
[01:16:35.738 --> 01:16:36.918]  She might have been telling the truth.
[01:16:37.378 --> 01:16:38.619]  Or she could have committed suicide.
[01:16:38.639 --> 01:16:44.301]  But when you start seeing a pattern of this, it leans towards political assassination.
[01:16:45.322 --> 01:16:53.425]  But look, the Bush administration has no need to get rid of their own people because most of them are on board.
[01:16:54.505 --> 01:17:00.488]  O'Neill, for some reason, was a little more big government style and didn't want to cut taxes.
[01:17:01.948 --> 01:17:04.811]  If you're going to cut taxes, you have to cut government programs.
[01:17:05.851 --> 01:17:16.580]  And there was some fighting between O'Neill and Bush, and now O'Neill is out there speaking out against Bush while trying to spin it that he isn't, more doublespeak.
[01:17:18.541 --> 01:17:20.163]  Again, I don't like to speculate.
[01:17:20.663 --> 01:17:25.807]  I just don't like to speculate, and I don't know if they murdered the Secretary of the Navy.
[01:17:26.327 --> 01:17:27.729]  He was becoming the Secretary of the Navy.
[01:17:28.129 --> 01:17:29.530]  I know Clinton did have
[01:17:30.667 --> 01:17:33.830]  Some admirals taken out, or at least those behind Clinton did.
[01:17:34.050 --> 01:17:49.183]  There were clearly some murders of high-level military officials in the first few years of the Clinton White House, especially when Clinton started coming out with his new presidential decision directives to have the nuclear forces stand down.
[01:17:50.304 --> 01:17:54.047]  There were quite a few officers that died suddenly when that was announced.
[01:17:54.588 --> 01:17:55.949]  I guess they weren't going to go along with it.
[01:17:57.095 --> 01:17:58.917]  Let's talk to Maggie in Texas.
[01:17:58.977 --> 01:17:59.917]  Maggie, you're on the air.
[01:17:59.957 --> 01:18:00.277]  Welcome.
[01:18:00.898 --> 01:18:02.079]  Hi, Alex.
[01:18:02.519 --> 01:18:07.022]  Your earlier mention of offshore call centers reminded me of this.
[01:18:08.003 --> 01:18:22.633]  About two or three months ago, no more, there was a little item very briefly in the news about how Dell Computer was pulling back a few hundred of its jobs in Bangalore to the United States because of
[01:18:23.996 --> 01:18:31.061]  from its corporate customers, which is most of them about, quote, thick accents and scripted responses.
[01:18:31.982 --> 01:18:39.027]  And this was on NPR one day, and I pulled up a couple of Google documents pertaining to it also.
[01:18:39.587 --> 01:18:51.516]  It said something to the effect that corporate customers who have had to call Bangalore for their computer questions will now have them answered by personnel and
[01:18:52.099 --> 01:18:54.602]  Texas, Tennessee, and I think it was Idaho.
[01:18:54.802 --> 01:19:07.016]  Okay, for those that just joined us, the majority, already the majority of customer service calls, including when you call for your welfare check, that's even admitted, government contracts going to India.
[01:19:07.942 --> 01:19:09.043]  I think you're right.
[01:19:24.074 --> 01:19:25.975]  And yeah, it's always somebody from India.
[01:19:25.995 --> 01:19:27.516]  They don't know what they're talking about.
[01:19:27.957 --> 01:19:29.278]  And we should all complain.
[01:19:29.598 --> 01:19:32.319]  We should all say, I'm sending this computer back.
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:33.800]  I'm sending this telephone back.
[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:35.682]  I'm sending back this piece of equipment.
[01:19:36.042 --> 01:19:38.463]  If you don't give me an American right now.
[01:19:39.964 --> 01:19:42.046]  Alex, my further question... Stay there.
[01:19:42.166 --> 01:19:43.006]  Stay there, Maggie.
[01:19:43.607 --> 01:19:44.627]  I want to finish up with you.
[01:19:44.787 --> 01:19:45.768]  You're making some good points.
[01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:53.313]  The majority of the telemarketing and customer service calls are in India.
[01:19:55.021 --> 01:19:59.788]  And the state welfare agencies are starting to all contract with India.
[01:20:00.168 --> 01:20:01.490]  That should be illegal.
[01:20:04.189 --> 01:20:08.252]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[01:20:30.547 --> 01:20:32.487]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.

[01:20:46.730 --> 01:20:47.211]  That's right.

[01:21:05.310 --> 01:21:07.352]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[01:21:07.532 --> 01:21:09.174]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot.
[01:21:09.314 --> 01:21:17.281]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[01:21:17.542 --> 01:21:23.968]  Imagine hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini, followed by peaches, mixed root, or pineapple for dessert.
[01:21:24.168 --> 01:21:25.389]  Just a few of the many selections.
[01:21:25.609 --> 01:21:28.990]  Visit www.longlifefood.com for a complete menu.
[01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:32.731]  Both FEMA and the Red Cross have suggested having food stored in case of disaster.
[01:21:32.911 --> 01:21:38.372]  The Long Life Food Depot was recently mentioned in the USA Today article on the very subject of emergency preparations.
[01:21:38.732 --> 01:21:41.453]  It makes sense to be prepared, and Long Life Food Depot makes it easy.
[01:21:41.653 --> 01:21:45.654]  Long-term storable MREs make for convenience when camping, hiking, or canoeing.
[01:21:45.874 --> 01:21:47.915]  No fires allowed, hot meals still are.

[01:23:04.659 --> 01:23:05.199]  We're good to go.

[01:23:40.883 --> 01:23:41.564]  Not convinced yet?

[01:24:05.374 --> 01:24:10.516]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:11.196 --> 01:24:13.457]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:24:16.127 --> 01:24:17.588]  Again, let me boil this down.
[01:24:19.450 --> 01:24:30.919]  There have been laws that if there's going to be a weapons contract or a welfare contract or a construction contract, you have to give it to American companies.
[01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:41.267]  But then most of our companies became international and built their divisions in Europe or Latin America or Asia, and so they've changed all those laws.
[01:24:42.427 --> 01:24:42.848]  And now...
[01:24:43.935 --> 01:24:48.305]  Most of the states, when you call for your welfare check, this was on 60 Minutes last night.
[01:24:48.665 --> 01:24:49.908]  I had read articles about this.
[01:24:50.289 --> 01:24:53.175]  Most of them, the calls go to India.
[01:24:54.477 --> 01:24:55.099]  You're calling.
[01:24:56.114 --> 01:25:05.718]  About your welfare check or your social security, whatever, and you're talking to somebody who can barely speak English, and they showed it on television last night, who are reading off scripts.
[01:25:05.778 --> 01:25:10.480]  They're taught how to sound more Western off simple scripts.
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:11.760]  I help you.
[01:25:12.281 --> 01:25:13.861]  So your computer's not working well.
[01:25:13.901 --> 01:25:15.942]  Well, let me try to go through this with you.
[01:25:17.003 --> 01:25:18.443]  It's all staged.
[01:25:18.843 --> 01:25:25.286]  And I've been on the phone with these people, and they'll sound okay at first, and after five minutes of trying to fix a computer problem,
[01:25:25.919 --> 01:25:26.779]  We're good to go.
[01:25:26.799 --> 01:25:26.979]  I think?
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:26:00.445]  Understand, folks, we pay taxes, they build a big government, and then we don't even get to work for the government.
[01:26:01.085 --> 01:26:02.947]  Now it goes to a foreign country.
[01:26:03.667 --> 01:26:04.648]  That should be illegal.
[01:26:05.028 --> 01:26:06.109]  Now let's go back to Maggie.
[01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:06.890]  Maggie, go ahead.
[01:26:07.170 --> 01:26:09.472]  Oh, you just taught me a few things, Alex.
[01:26:09.852 --> 01:26:22.602]  When I last called Sony for some help, I could actually hear the person typing on his own keyboard and bringing up the same pages of the same guidebook that I had failed to understand.
[01:26:23.351 --> 01:26:34.231]  But getting back to Dell, though, quickly, the idea of an international corporation like Dell even responding to a complaint
[01:26:35.476 --> 01:26:36.837]  Well, they're phasing them out.
[01:26:36.997 --> 01:26:41.239]  We're at the crossroads of biometrics, the crossroads of RFID, the crossroads of the surveillance grid.
[01:26:59.046 --> 01:27:02.087]  And many times, when I call customer service on an issue, and I'm talking to somebody in India,
[01:27:19.163 --> 01:27:22.866]  I demand that they transfer me to a call center in the U.S.
[01:27:23.386 --> 01:27:24.487]  every time they do it.
[01:27:24.907 --> 01:27:26.749]  So what they're doing is what you just mentioned.
[01:27:27.109 --> 01:27:36.075]  For corporate customers and others, they've still got people that know what they're talking about here, and you will get transferred back to the United States.
[01:27:36.696 --> 01:27:37.436]  Oh, okay.
[01:27:37.556 --> 01:27:38.297]  One more thing.
[01:27:38.837 --> 01:27:42.820]  Quickly, I remember when Dell first announced with pride that they were going to –
[01:27:43.547 --> 01:27:43.987]  We're good to go.
[01:27:44.007 --> 01:27:44.267]  I think?
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:02.341]  Who's those kind of people?
[01:28:02.361 --> 01:28:05.904]  Well, regardless, if a private company wants to do that, it's a free country.
[01:28:06.325 --> 01:28:08.006]  But we should not buy their products.
[01:28:08.106 --> 01:28:09.407]  We should demand better service.
[01:28:09.507 --> 01:28:14.352]  But when the government does it, no, you keep the money here in America.
[01:28:14.472 --> 01:28:14.872]  Oh, right.
[01:28:15.473 --> 01:28:16.233]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[01:28:16.374 --> 01:28:16.554]  Yeah.
[01:28:17.194 --> 01:28:23.100]  And, folks, I've been mentioning this a lot lately because it's something that's kind of, I've known about it for years, but I never really talk about it.
[01:28:24.201 --> 01:28:25.582]  There are two different federal laws.
[01:28:27.442 --> 01:28:31.763]  And why do you think it's foreigners that own all the gas stations, all the hotels?
[01:28:32.683 --> 01:28:38.265]  Because citizens, whether you're black or white or Hispanic or whatever, you can't compete against them.
[01:28:39.325 --> 01:28:40.306]  Why can't you compete?
[01:28:40.326 --> 01:28:42.646]  It's not because they're so hardworking.
[01:28:42.666 --> 01:28:46.147]  I mean, folks, listen, talk about discrimination.
[01:28:46.167 --> 01:28:49.988]  I mean, I know how blacks feel when only, you know, whites own the big businesses.
[01:28:50.948 --> 01:28:54.489]  I've never seen a hotel that wasn't owned by Indians.
[01:28:55.510 --> 01:28:56.510]  And this is in the last 10 years.
[01:28:57.774 --> 01:28:58.875]  And I'm not against Indians.
[01:28:58.955 --> 01:29:00.857]  My point is, how can they do that?
[01:29:02.118 --> 01:29:10.486]  Well, because they're as hardworking and as smart as Americans, but on top of it, they get 7 to 10 years of no income tax.
[01:29:11.447 --> 01:29:15.531]  That's 30, 40 percent bigger profit, investment.
[01:29:16.312 --> 01:29:18.033]  No one can compete against that.
[01:29:18.454 --> 01:29:20.996]  No one can compete in prices against that.
[01:29:21.697 --> 01:29:22.818]  Do you understand?
[01:29:23.983 --> 01:29:25.183]  Why did the government do that?
[01:29:25.443 --> 01:29:27.144]  It shows what they think of citizens.
[01:29:27.664 --> 01:29:38.887]  Why would the government give foreigners the incentive to come here and get no taxes for seven to ten years, depending on what federal program they follow?
[01:29:39.907 --> 01:29:41.167]  Why, why, why?
[01:29:41.507 --> 01:29:42.547]  No one's addressed that.
[01:29:42.867 --> 01:29:43.488]  We know why.
[01:29:43.508 --> 01:29:44.608]  To get rid of the middle class.
[01:29:46.168 --> 01:29:53.010]  All right, Spencer and Chris and Dan and Richard and others, your calls are coming up as well as Paul Watson and the Big News Blitz.
[01:29:54.682 --> 01:29:55.585]  We're on the march.
[01:29:56.086 --> 01:29:57.670]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:58.633 --> 01:30:01.300]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:04.423 --> 01:30:05.383]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:30:05.463 --> 01:30:10.245]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:30:10.425 --> 01:30:18.228]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:30:18.488 --> 01:30:23.850]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:30:24.050 --> 01:30:31.032]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:30:31.332 --> 01:30:36.657]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:30:36.937 --> 01:30:41.681]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation.
[01:30:42.022 --> 01:30:49.628]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:30:49.968 --> 01:30:55.433]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:30:56.514 --> 01:30:57.554]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:30:57.574 --> 01:30:57.775]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:31:16.261 --> 01:31:18.142]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:31:18.182 --> 01:31:20.464]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:31:20.624 --> 01:31:28.348]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[01:31:28.728 --> 01:31:37.633]  Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and your family from the Fed's plans for your hard-earned money.
[01:31:37.793 --> 01:31:38.894]  Don't gamble with your future.
[01:31:39.074 --> 01:31:40.435]  Call Midas Resources today.
[01:31:40.675 --> 01:31:43.317]  And ask for your free copy of As Good as Gold.
[01:31:43.518 --> 01:31:49.122]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[01:31:49.443 --> 01:31:52.025]  As Good as Gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:31:54.267 --> 01:31:58.370]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[01:31:58.531 --> 01:31:59.571]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[01:32:03.683 --> 01:32:09.246]  Did you know without cholesterol, your body wouldn't make important hormones like estrogen and testosterone?
[01:32:09.546 --> 01:32:11.407]  Without cholesterol, your mood would drop.
[01:32:11.507 --> 01:32:12.727]  Your skin would dry out.
[01:32:12.867 --> 01:32:16.529]  You wouldn't make any vitamin D nor any bile to digest fatty foods.
[01:32:16.849 --> 01:32:18.590]  This is health journalist Bill Sardi.
[01:32:18.670 --> 01:32:21.571]  Cholesterol is not a life-threatening toxin.
[01:32:21.811 --> 01:32:27.794]  Despite efforts to reduce cholesterol and fats in your diet, your liver will make about a glass full of cholesterol a day.
[01:32:28.054 --> 01:32:31.456]  The bottom line is we need to maintain healthy cholesterol levels.
[01:32:31.736 --> 01:32:36.700]  That's just what Lifespan Nutrition has done with its revolutionary Normatrol formula.
[01:32:37.101 --> 01:32:43.125]  It provides potent amounts of lecithin along with rice bran, flaxseed, taurine, boron, and magnesium.
[01:32:43.506 --> 01:32:50.171]  Call 866-405-4000 to find out about this revolutionary dietary supplement called Normatrol.
[01:32:50.411 --> 01:32:52.473]  That's 866-405-4000.
[01:32:53.294 --> 01:32:57.177]  Lifespan Nutrition wants to help you maintain healthy cholesterol levels.
[01:32:57.197 --> 01:32:57.237]  866-405-4000.
[01:33:09.346 --> 01:33:11.247]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:11.727 --> 01:33:14.548]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:15.848 --> 01:33:16.308]  All right.
[01:33:16.928 --> 01:33:20.129]  For the loaded phones, we're going to get to everybody here in just a few minutes.
[01:33:20.169 --> 01:33:22.050]  We're going to have Paul Watson with us for the next hour.
[01:33:22.090 --> 01:33:23.650]  Then I've got Ranch Rescue coming on.
[01:33:24.171 --> 01:33:28.012]  Talk about the Mexican troops shooting at their organization.
[01:33:28.032 --> 01:33:32.973]  They've been shooting at the Border Patrol, killing members of the Border Patrol, forest agents, you name it.
[01:33:34.454 --> 01:33:35.594]  But Paul Watson...
[01:33:36.696 --> 01:33:53.822]  I don't know if you were just listening, but I was talking about how they've had this law for I think about 15 years here in the U.S., and if you didn't know about this, folks, you should check it out, where for 7 to 10 years, foreigners were opening a new business.
[01:33:53.922 --> 01:33:55.042]  Only foreigners get this.
[01:33:55.803 --> 01:34:00.624]  Get, in many cases, a decade of tax exemption.
[01:34:01.184 --> 01:34:02.565]  No one can compete against that.
[01:34:03.670 --> 01:34:07.531]  You try not paying your taxes for 10 years, folks, and see what they do to you.
[01:34:08.471 --> 01:34:10.572]  You see, but you're not a foreigner.
[01:34:11.032 --> 01:34:14.853]  Why, Paul Watson, would the government do something like that?
[01:34:15.934 --> 01:34:26.377]  Well, obviously, we know the agenda to destroy the economy and jobs in the country, but you were talking about the coal sensors which are being farmed out to all these different countries.
[01:34:26.397 --> 01:34:33.139]  I actually had a friend tell me that he called up BET, which is the biggest telephone provider in this country,
[01:34:34.131 --> 01:34:46.046]  And what most people don't know is that it's company policy with these call centres in India, for example, that the person that answers your call cannot actually, under company policy, tell you their name.
[01:34:46.579 --> 01:35:03.430]  They're ordered to create fake names which sound British, and it came out in the London Guardian that they're actually trained as to what's going on in the soap operas in Britain and what the weather's like, so it can appear as if you're actually calling within the country.
[01:35:03.791 --> 01:35:06.592]  They even showed that last night.
[01:35:07.113 --> 01:35:08.514]  They watch Hollywood movies.
[01:35:08.554 --> 01:35:10.095]  They watch the soap operas.
[01:35:11.136 --> 01:35:17.386]  They teach them how to, and then to lie to you to go, oh yes, I'm in England, I'm in the U.S.
[01:35:17.406 --> 01:35:18.408]  This was saying the U.S.
[01:35:18.468 --> 01:35:18.969]  last night.
[01:35:19.290 --> 01:35:21.794]  Oh, that's, I mean, again, look at the deception of that.
[01:35:23.067 --> 01:35:35.176]  And it's also actually, my friend asked this particular person which company they worked for or which subsidiary, and they said that they were ordered by the company not to divulge that information.
[01:35:35.196 --> 01:35:40.580]  So not only can they not tell you their real name, they can't even tell you who they're working for.
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:45.023]  And you're supposed to give them your Social Security numbers, your credit card numbers.
[01:35:45.623 --> 01:35:47.425]  They've got all your data, folks.
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:50.921]  And then you can't get any data on them.
[01:35:50.961 --> 01:35:53.542]  So yeah, it's all about knowing everything that we're doing.
[01:35:53.562 --> 01:36:00.665]  And yet when you try to get some help from these people, it's all company policy not to divulge anything whatsoever.
[01:36:02.026 --> 01:36:02.786]  It's amazing.
[01:36:02.806 --> 01:36:09.029]  Paul, I want to run through about ten articles, get your take on them, then I want to go to some calls and get into more news into the next hour.
[01:36:09.549 --> 01:36:12.150]  Troops find chemical weapons in Iraq.
[01:36:12.210 --> 01:36:17.473]  Dozens of mortar rounds containing chemical weapons have been found buried under a road in southern Iraq.
[01:36:17.513 --> 01:36:18.873]  It was revealed last night.
[01:36:19.354 --> 01:36:21.955]  This is on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:36:22.375 --> 01:36:29.438]  Test of a suspicious liquid that was leaking from the shells found that it was a form of blister gas, which include mustard gas,
[01:36:30.214 --> 01:36:31.074]  Paul, your response to this?
[01:36:57.682 --> 01:37:11.568]  Well, I mean, ridiculous saying that Iraq hadn't declared them, because even before the war started, Iraq produced this 12,000-page dossier on what weapons they had and which ones the UN had destroyed.
[01:37:11.968 --> 01:37:18.851]  The government tore out 8,000 pages and said, look, there's evidence missing, they're lying, so we know what's going on there, but I mean...
[01:37:19.446 --> 01:37:22.490]  I mean, it's obvious that this isn't any kind of smoking gun proof.
[01:37:22.530 --> 01:37:25.354]  Otherwise, it would be all over the headline news.
[01:37:25.795 --> 01:37:30.321]  By the way, the 12,000 pages, the Iraqis were smart enough to send other copies to the press.
[01:37:31.082 --> 01:37:33.164]  When they thought only two copies were at the U.N.
[01:37:33.205 --> 01:37:34.506]  building, U.S.
[01:37:34.586 --> 01:37:35.608]  Special Forces...
[01:37:36.702 --> 01:37:41.085]  Rated the building, grabbed the documents, excised them, then released them.
[01:37:41.366 --> 01:37:44.888]  Then when people got other copies, there were the documents of U.S.
[01:37:44.928 --> 01:37:48.111]  companies, including the Bushes, selling Saddam the weapons.
[01:37:48.571 --> 01:37:49.432]  Think about that!
[01:37:49.872 --> 01:37:52.434]  And that came out in the mainstream German media.
[01:37:52.854 --> 01:37:58.480]  I mean, Kofi Annan admitted that that raid had taken place and yet he wasn't concerned about doing anything about it.
[01:37:58.861 --> 01:38:12.115]  But I mean, what this serves to do with these little stories coming out about, you know, so-called weapons of mass destruction or mass distraction, as Tony Blair calls them, it subtly buries in the mind of the casual...
[01:38:12.888 --> 01:38:34.315]  Observer, the whole WMD premise was true because they don't see what we report, which are the later retractions where the mobile bio-trucks turn out to be for blowing up helium balloons and were sold by the British, and the biological factories which actually turn out to be bakeries, etc., etc.
[01:38:35.136 --> 01:38:37.336]  And, I mean, we've even got Colin Powell.
[01:38:37.357 --> 01:38:38.577]  We've got the videotape.
[01:38:39.476 --> 01:39:01.410]  What do you make of Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill talking about Bush having a plan to attack Iraq day one in the White House, and the media focusing in on that, but ignoring the PNAC documents, which are from the President?
[01:39:02.222 --> 01:39:05.964]  Well, I basically knew that it was a whitewash as soon as it came out.
[01:39:06.044 --> 01:39:11.566]  I've barely posted anything on it because we already proved that the war was planned years in advance over and over again.
[01:39:11.586 --> 01:39:19.809]  I mean, on top of the PNAC documents which stated, as you mentioned, that Saddam was just a pretext to invade in September 2000 was the most...
[01:39:22.501 --> 01:39:24.142]  The one that got most coverage in the media.
[01:39:24.502 --> 01:39:43.672]  On top of that, we have the March 2001 documents from the Cheney Energy Task Force, which laid out all the Iraqi oil fields, pipelines, refineries, terminals, and strategized actually on which companies would get all the contracts after an invasion.
[01:39:43.692 --> 01:39:49.014]  I mean, Judicial Watch got these documents, which were originally written in March 2001.
[01:39:49.675 --> 01:39:51.756]  And so with this O'Neill thing,
[01:39:52.412 --> 01:39:59.197]  I mean, we got the Drudge Report posting his comments from a year ago where he says he would never criticize the Bush administration.
[01:39:59.217 --> 01:40:05.801]  Yeah, what they do is they have O'Neill bring this out with a weak argument, tear it apart, and then try to put the whole thing to bed.
[01:40:06.642 --> 01:40:07.802]  Yeah, that's exactly what it's about.
[01:40:07.822 --> 01:40:11.945]  It's about debunking O'Neill to debunk the whole argument.
[01:40:11.985 --> 01:40:17.329]  But what's more interesting, which only received attention in one media report, was
[01:40:18.038 --> 01:40:23.801]  Also, O'Neill's comments about the fact that Bush would conduct policy meetings like a deaf man.
[01:40:23.821 --> 01:40:27.082]  He would basically never say anything and just sit there nodding.
[01:40:27.122 --> 01:40:34.285]  So again, emphasising the point that Bush is just a figurehead and he's not really running anything, basically.
[01:40:34.326 --> 01:40:46.211]  And that's something the media doesn't want to report because then they can focus this big left-wing juggernaut onto the distraction of Bush-hating when targeting Bush really won't change anything.
[01:40:47.399 --> 01:40:47.979]  Exactly.
[01:40:48.039 --> 01:40:50.840]  I mean, Bush, Clinton, they're just front men, just puppets.
[01:40:52.041 --> 01:40:54.182]  Paul, there is so much news here.
[01:40:55.142 --> 01:40:58.703]  And let's get into the latest Diana developments.
[01:40:58.763 --> 01:41:00.504]  I mean, it's clear they murdered her.
[01:41:00.904 --> 01:41:05.146]  She was pregnant with, you know, this Arab's child.
[01:41:05.566 --> 01:41:08.167]  She said they're going to kill me in a fake automobile accident.
[01:41:08.447 --> 01:41:09.407]  That indeed happened.
[01:41:09.587 --> 01:41:10.748]  There's been new developments.
[01:41:11.908 --> 01:41:16.370]  Well, developments a few days ago came from London Times mainly.
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:30.174]  Who reported that Scotland Yard, which is the biggest metropolitan police force in London, had been brought into the Diana investigation to quote, dismiss the conspiracy theories.
[01:41:30.534 --> 01:41:31.736]  Now according to the media...
[01:41:32.456 --> 01:41:48.583]  They are listing all the evidence that we talk about which is proven as conspiracy theory so in effect what they're saying is that Scotland Yard are getting involved to cover up the evidence so on the back of that we had it out of the Observer yesterday.
[01:41:49.519 --> 01:41:57.068]  The note that Diana wrote saying that Charles was going to kill her in a car crash was actually written a couple of years before it was claimed.
[01:41:57.529 --> 01:42:02.616]  Now, obviously, that's part of the dismissal process, but even if that was true, we have...
[01:42:03.328 --> 01:42:04.429]  We're good to go.
[01:42:28.368 --> 01:42:43.977]  London Times also reported that the blood samples, and I mean, we knew this, but now they're just admitting it, the blood samples of the driver, Henri Paul, who was supposedly drunk at the time, were switched with somebody else, proving the official story that he was drunk.
[01:42:44.077 --> 01:42:49.800]  And we covered this years ago, and just about a month ago, you talked about this on air, and now here it is, mainstream news.
[01:42:50.572 --> 01:42:54.915]  But, of course, they said it was just an accident, and we shouldn't worry about it.
[01:42:54.935 --> 01:43:08.442]  Just like the cameras turned off minutes before the crash in the tunnel and turned towards the wall on accident, just like the car was stolen and then returned, detailed days before, just like all of this stuff.
[01:43:09.343 --> 01:43:10.583]  And it also came out that the...
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:15.883]  They're going to re-examine the Mercedes which was involved in the crash.
[01:43:16.524 --> 01:43:24.431]  And as you mentioned, before the crash, the Mercedes was changed and was a different model to the one they'd been using earlier in the day.
[01:43:24.811 --> 01:43:35.400]  Now, on top of that, we have the Queen's former coroner, who works for her, coming out and saying, oh, I saw the body, she wasn't pregnant.
[01:43:36.727 --> 01:43:41.433]  Yeah, which is obviously yet another part of this dismissal process which they publicly announced.
[01:43:42.334 --> 01:43:47.561]  We had Diana two days before she died saying, I've got a big announcement in two days.
[01:43:47.961 --> 01:43:52.547]  The people who were intimately involved with Diana said she was pregnant as well.
[01:43:54.170 --> 01:43:56.671]  I mean, it's one lie after another at the moment.
[01:43:56.711 --> 01:44:07.714]  They're doing exactly what I predicted, which was to admit these so-called conspiracy theories, as they call them, but then try and whitewash them to bury the whole process.
[01:44:09.175 --> 01:44:11.956]  And the same thing's going on with O'Neill right now.
[01:44:12.596 --> 01:44:16.317]  The Mars mission, Bush is going to announce it supposedly in two days.
[01:44:16.897 --> 01:44:19.018]  He's already cancelled one announcement last month.
[01:44:20.372 --> 01:44:34.831]  Well, it's obvious that partly it's a PR stunt in the Kennedy vein, which you mentioned earlier, to aid Bush's re-election, but I think it goes a lot further than that.
[01:44:34.851 --> 01:44:35.011]  I mean,
[01:44:35.797 --> 01:44:43.824]  NASA itself is not an independent organization devoted to, you know, peacefully exploring space.
[01:44:43.904 --> 01:44:49.149]  It's basically a criminal arm of the government because most of the funds don't go into space exploration.
[01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:54.454]  That's why, I mean, we've got NASA involved with the brain scanners at Boston Logan Airport.
[01:44:55.174 --> 01:45:01.920]  So, I mean, we've got to focus on militarization of space at the moment, and that was actually in the PNAC document.
[01:45:03.402 --> 01:45:10.986]  And if you look at the space shuttle program itself, it's 90% controlled by private military contractors.
[01:45:11.466 --> 01:45:20.410]  And it was actually Clinton that began that process back in 1996 when he gave Boeing and Lockheed Martin basically free reign to space.
[01:45:20.470 --> 01:45:24.732]  Yeah, I know about 80 plus percent of the missions are classified.
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:34.927]  And so they've been spending this classified black budget on things like the Aurora Project, which is basically an advanced space plane.
[01:45:36.348 --> 01:45:44.634]  And on top of that, as soon as they got into power, the Bush administration began appointing directors of NASA from the military sector.
[01:45:44.674 --> 01:45:51.739]  So in the PNAC documents, we've got what they call full-spectrum dominance, which is basically...
[01:45:52.359 --> 01:45:54.862]  And this was leaked in the middle of last year.
[01:45:55.222 --> 01:46:04.932]  It's about creating a military empire in space with the idea of claiming ownership of near-Earth space and not allowing any other countries to gain access.
[01:46:04.992 --> 01:46:15.221]  And so with this black budget, and this is what I think is what this whole new mission is about, it's about funneling the money into these Aurora space planes.
[01:46:16.022 --> 01:46:24.591]  I mean, this mission's publicly stated that they will have the ability to destroy any satellites put into orbit by other nations.
[01:46:25.152 --> 01:46:29.476]  And then on top of that, we've got the lunar base, which they've also been talking about.
[01:46:30.557 --> 01:46:36.063]  And again, it's stated in PNAC that they need a lunar base to act as a military outpost.
[01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:42.451]  So they're basically going to tear up the space treaty and have this all set in motion by 2014.
[01:46:43.351 --> 01:46:46.232]  So it's nothing to do with exploring space.
[01:46:46.272 --> 01:46:47.852]  It's about militarizing space.
[01:46:48.373 --> 01:46:57.415]  And people's tax dollars are basically going to fund the New World Order's next colony, their next empire, which they've announced will be in space.
[01:46:58.775 --> 01:47:02.336]  And that's what we'd all read from the documents over the last few decades.
[01:47:02.356 --> 01:47:03.816]  That's exactly their plan.
[01:47:04.674 --> 01:47:09.296]  And they're also going to have these big platforms in space, these battle stations.
[01:47:09.757 --> 01:47:11.918]  Folks, this isn't Alex Jones saying this.
[01:47:11.938 --> 01:47:20.122]  This is the government with particle beams, you name it, where they can just fry people individually on the surface of the Earth.
[01:47:21.469 --> 01:47:22.530]  That's going to be nice.
[01:47:22.690 --> 01:47:29.497]  And a new ground-penetrating radar arrays in space to look through our walls, not just take photos of us.
[01:47:30.438 --> 01:47:31.800]  Very, very scary stuff.
[01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:33.501]  A few calls and we'll get back into news.
[01:47:33.962 --> 01:47:35.283]  And there's a bunch of it here, folks.
[01:47:35.303 --> 01:47:36.485]  That's just a small tidbit.
[01:47:37.265 --> 01:47:42.231]  Let's talk to Spencer in Ohio, then Chris, Dan, Richard.
[01:47:42.991 --> 01:47:44.572]  And Stacy and others.
[01:47:44.832 --> 01:47:45.292]  Go ahead.
[01:47:45.512 --> 01:47:46.453]  You're on the air, Spencer.
[01:47:47.013 --> 01:47:48.534]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:47:49.214 --> 01:47:54.897]  Which gas station should I start boycotting to keep the Bush empire from getting any richer?
[01:47:55.417 --> 01:47:59.939]  Secondly, what does your guest think when America burns their Beatle albums?
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:03.661]  And if he knows what a poly-orp is.
[01:48:04.201 --> 01:48:04.501]  All right.
[01:48:04.541 --> 01:48:05.662]  Thanks for the call.
[01:48:06.142 --> 01:48:08.583]  Let me just comment on that question.
[01:48:09.221 --> 01:48:13.302]  First question, the Bushes are a high-level servant management family.
[01:48:14.243 --> 01:48:16.924]  They do own some oil companies and some stock.
[01:48:16.944 --> 01:48:19.805]  They're worth tens of billions of dollars.
[01:48:20.225 --> 01:48:22.926]  They hide their wealth, but they're just puppets.
[01:48:22.966 --> 01:48:25.887]  So, I mean, there's really no way to boycott the Bushes.
[01:48:26.127 --> 01:48:28.668]  You want to boycott the Bushes, fight prison labor.
[01:48:29.706 --> 01:48:33.050]  These private prisons, that's what they're really, they invest their money mainly there.
[01:48:33.070 --> 01:48:34.672]  It's one of their biggest investments.
[01:48:35.654 --> 01:48:40.439]  And then I guess the other comment about Beatles albums was being sarcastic because Paul's British.
[01:48:41.060 --> 01:48:47.027]  And then the third question is, I've known what a poly-orp or whatever he said is, but I can't place it.
[01:48:47.908 --> 01:48:48.449]  Go ahead, Paul.
[01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:54.492]  No idea what a polyorb is, but even with the Beatles thing, it is interesting.
[01:48:54.572 --> 01:49:11.862]  Obviously, we have no agreement with John Lennon's religious or philosophical doctrines, but it is a fact that the man who killed him was trained at the School of the Americas, which was a CIA, basically, assassination program.
[01:49:12.423 --> 01:49:12.763]  And so...
[01:49:13.544 --> 01:49:19.245]  It's obvious that, I mean, John Lennon was killed because at the time he was becoming politically active.
[01:49:19.285 --> 01:49:29.847]  He started, yeah, he got out of all his liberalism and occult stuff and started writing songs, and I've got a CD of them, about the New World Order, you Satanists, you kill the children.
[01:49:29.867 --> 01:49:33.348]  I mean, these songs are, it sounds like Eyes Wide Shut, folks.
[01:49:34.168 --> 01:49:39.049]  And then this guy who admittedly had been part of a CIA program, and that's admitted, walks up and shoots him.
[01:49:40.515 --> 01:49:56.879]  Yes, I mean, at the time he was becoming a threat because before with the whole Hare Krishna, you know, peace hippie movement, they left him alone because that wasn't a threat because it was all, I mean, the LSD was brought in by the government in the first place and that was all set up.
[01:49:56.899 --> 01:50:05.561]  But when he started to focus on actually, you know, changing something and getting really involved, that's when he became too much of a threat for them to tolerate.
[01:50:05.581 --> 01:50:07.522]  So that's why he was taken out.
[01:50:09.583 --> 01:50:10.304]  Absolutely.
[01:50:10.324 --> 01:50:14.146]  We're going to break and come back and get into more news and calls.
[01:50:14.466 --> 01:50:16.587]  So, Chris and Dan and everybody, stay there.
[01:50:16.607 --> 01:50:17.327]  We're going to get to you.
[01:50:17.347 --> 01:50:20.369]  Paul's going to be with us into the next hour, so will you, hopefully.
[01:50:21.009 --> 01:50:23.210]  And I want to get into some of this other news.
[01:50:23.310 --> 01:50:25.992]  Blair admits weapons of mass destruction may never be found.
[01:50:26.012 --> 01:50:28.473]  I thought he'd resign if they didn't find him.
[01:50:29.454 --> 01:50:33.356]  Also, report all flyers to be assigned threat ranking.
[01:50:33.676 --> 01:50:35.617]  This is the CAPS-2 system.
[01:50:35.977 --> 01:50:37.598]  You're going to have this to have a job anywhere.
[01:50:38.468 --> 01:50:38.728]  U.S.
[01:50:38.888 --> 01:50:42.111]  Army College Attacks Bush Terror Policy.
[01:50:42.851 --> 01:50:43.632]  More than 500 U.S.
[01:50:43.972 --> 01:50:46.014]  soldiers killed in Iraq, says the Pentagon.
[01:50:46.374 --> 01:50:48.736]  Vaccine-linked Gulf War Syndrome.
[01:50:49.196 --> 01:50:53.279]  News of Australia and a bunch of other news.
[01:50:53.779 --> 01:50:55.661]  Again, we haven't even scratched the surface.
[01:50:56.141 --> 01:51:00.324]  It's all very important, and it's coming up on the other side of this quick break.
[01:51:00.444 --> 01:51:01.005]  Stay with us.
[01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:12.527]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:51:12.808 --> 01:51:17.552]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:51:17.772 --> 01:51:23.418]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:51:23.658 --> 01:51:28.179]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:51:28.399 --> 01:51:35.561]  The casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:51:35.581 --> 01:51:40.102]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:51:40.282 --> 01:51:42.782]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:51:43.022 --> 01:51:49.724]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[01:52:22.970 --> 01:52:26.093]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:52:26.353 --> 01:52:32.138]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.

[01:54:07.125 --> 01:54:13.129]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:54:13.749 --> 01:54:16.691]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:18.679 --> 01:54:27.627]  George Bush, on national television shortly after 9-11, George Bush said the war on terror would last 100 years.
[01:54:27.848 --> 01:54:29.669]  Others have said two, three generations.
[01:54:30.270 --> 01:54:31.431]  Here's the BBC.
[01:54:32.392 --> 01:54:34.334]  Terror war could last 50 years.
[01:54:34.574 --> 01:54:38.798]  And, of course, the big complex that's built up around it won't let it go away in 50 years.
[01:54:39.118 --> 01:54:40.980]  They'll provide more terror.
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:42.141]  It's like the drug war.
[01:54:42.972 --> 01:54:44.734]  People can't figure out why they'd ship it in.
[01:54:44.814 --> 01:54:51.579]  Not just the profits, but the police state and the prison industry and the corruption of the police they get out of it.
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:53.641]  Well, it's the same thing with the war on terror.
[01:54:54.201 --> 01:54:56.964]  They engage in the terror, they then get the business out of it.
[01:54:58.245 --> 01:55:11.456]  The war on terror could last up to 50 years, a senior UK intelligence officer has warned, speaking at a US government-sponsored conference in Las Vegas, Superintendent Stuart Harrison offered a rare insight into the intelligence community.
[01:55:12.014 --> 01:55:13.535]  We'll get more into that in the next hour.
[01:55:29.821 --> 01:55:38.266]  The British government trying to push this civil contingencies bill, and we've got the ID card on the racks as well.
[01:55:38.386 --> 01:55:46.751]  And we've got Rudolph Giuliani heading up, selling this to the states and counties, making tens of millions of dollars a year off the terror.
[01:55:47.011 --> 01:55:49.152]  That's his payoff for keeping his mouth shut.
[01:55:50.171 --> 01:56:00.379]  But in Britain, it's all permissible that we have this endless war on terror because basically this country's been under a state of emergency since September 11, officially.
[01:56:00.780 --> 01:56:09.707]  Also, also now, they're saying you've passed the 4 million mark of government surveillance cameras, and they're announcing they're going to add even more.
[01:56:10.708 --> 01:56:18.754]  Yeah, the 4 million number itself, and that was in the Independent yesterday, or today, Big Brother Britain 2004.
[01:56:21.165 --> 01:56:23.646]  They're saying 4.1, 4.2 million.
[01:56:23.686 --> 01:56:30.309]  There's actually probably that amount of cameras just in London alone because that's where they're taking the figures from.
[01:56:30.969 --> 01:56:42.353]  We've had reports before which say 10, 15 million and now they've got programs to put them in areas of natural wilderness to keep out people trying to start forest fires.
[01:56:42.913 --> 01:56:45.776]  Yeah, and now here it's, oh, to stop junk dumping.
[01:56:46.356 --> 01:56:50.140]  All the woods in Austin are going to have cameras and microphones.
[01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:53.883]  Again, this is right out of 1984.
[01:56:54.143 --> 01:57:06.935]  Yeah, three years ago, the British government announced a £70 million program, which is about $150 million to put cameras in the trees in every single natural wilderness area.
[01:57:07.015 --> 01:57:08.096]  And now it gets worse.
[01:57:08.376 --> 01:57:09.257]  Now you have...
[01:57:09.717 --> 01:57:14.821]  Them shouting at you with bullhorns on the cameras, with tattletales watching you.
[01:57:14.881 --> 01:57:16.923]  Now the New York Times announces that here.
[01:57:17.323 --> 01:57:21.207]  That's where they'll get their manpower to man all these, but the border stays wide open.
[01:57:21.487 --> 01:57:22.568]  Paul, we've got about a minute left.
[01:57:22.588 --> 01:57:24.930]  We're going to come back and take calls, but plug your book.
[01:57:25.110 --> 01:57:25.650]  I carry it.
[01:57:25.810 --> 01:57:26.451]  I published it.
[01:57:26.771 --> 01:57:27.612]  Order out of chaos.
[01:57:27.652 --> 01:57:28.873]  It's the best work out there.
[01:57:29.153 --> 01:57:30.014]  Why should folks get it?
[01:57:30.928 --> 01:57:47.066]  Well, one chapter that we've got, which is basically the last chapter, because I was finishing the book right as the Iraq war was going on, goes through all the different quotes out of the PNAC documents, which we've been talking about today, which prove that the war was staged in advance.
[01:57:47.486 --> 01:57:49.208]  So, I mean, we've got that chapter, we've got...
[01:57:50.429 --> 01:57:52.311]  Bottom line, folks, it's 19 bucks.
[01:58:08.406 --> 01:58:11.708]  The book's over 300 pages full of photos, documents, legislation.
[01:58:11.728 --> 01:58:11.708]  $19.95.
[01:58:12.908 --> 01:58:15.629]  We've got a second copy to give as a gift.
[01:58:15.749 --> 01:58:16.230]  It's for $11.95.

[01:58:43.747 --> 01:58:44.948]  Expose the terrorists.
[01:58:45.048 --> 01:58:46.129]  Expose these criminals.
[01:58:46.389 --> 01:58:48.370]  We cannot allow them to get away with this.
[01:58:48.971 --> 01:58:51.112]  We can only stop them by exposing them.
[01:58:51.152 --> 01:58:51.973]  They're murderers.
[01:58:52.253 --> 01:58:52.974]  Help us do it.
[01:58:56.018 --> 01:59:00.501]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:59:00.861 --> 01:59:04.944]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:59:05.244 --> 01:59:05.784]  We listened.
[01:59:06.104 --> 01:59:11.068]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:59:11.348 --> 01:59:11.848]  We listened.
[01:59:12.228 --> 01:59:15.270]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:59:15.691 --> 01:59:16.211]  We listened.
[01:59:16.671 --> 01:59:17.352]  We're good to go.
[01:59:50.293 --> 01:59:53.014]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:01.016 --> 02:00:01.676]  Big Brother.
[02:00:02.316 --> 02:00:03.396]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:04.096 --> 02:00:05.176]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:05.857 --> 02:00:06.657]  You want answers?
[02:00:07.417 --> 02:00:08.317]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:08.977 --> 02:00:12.698]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:13.158 --> 02:00:15.519]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[02:00:16.423 --> 02:00:17.304]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:18.926 --> 02:00:22.350]  Well, our last hour was a great hour of radio.
[02:00:22.370 --> 02:00:28.117]  We probably covered 20 different important news items exposing the criminal activities of the global elite.
[02:00:29.098 --> 02:00:29.899]  Took a lot of calls.
[02:00:29.919 --> 02:00:37.047]  We've got Paul Watson, who comes on at least once a week, because I respect his great analysis, and I agree with what he's saying.
[02:00:37.808 --> 02:00:38.108]  Hello, Alex.
[02:00:38.128 --> 02:00:38.609]  Hello, Paul.
[02:00:59.994 --> 02:01:01.635]  I wanted to talk about Social Security.
[02:01:01.875 --> 02:01:03.375]  Three years ago I broke my back.
[02:01:03.496 --> 02:01:09.478]  I had three neurosurgeons all say that I needed another back operation and also another operation in my neck.
[02:01:10.078 --> 02:01:26.464]  And these calls that I make to the Social Security office, they must go to India because I went to a hearing and continually get jerked around from Social Security for the disability claim where three neurosurgeons say that I do need both surgeries and I am disabled.
[02:01:26.946 --> 02:01:42.015]  And I'm very upset at the fact that George Bush wants to give Social Security to illegal immigrants and Mexicans, whereas hardworking Americans who are unable to work have been jerked around for years, and I know there's tens of thousands of people in the audience right now hearing this.
[02:01:42.035 --> 02:01:51.781]  So what I did today, after I heard that the calls were being given to India, I told this person on the telephone that I wanted a direct letter from the commissioner.
[02:01:51.801 --> 02:01:53.322]  Her name is Barthart.
[02:01:53.843 --> 02:01:58.335]  To say that this call was answered and I want my request requested.
[02:01:58.415 --> 02:02:02.667]  And just in this morning's Australian newspaper, there are...
[02:02:04.555 --> 02:02:15.520]  670,000 people that are disabled, and there's an outsourcing agency that are forcing these people to get jobs, and this agency is going to get $6,000 per person that gives these people a minimum wage job.
[02:02:15.540 --> 02:02:17.841]  Well, yeah, that's how the corporate welfare works.
[02:02:18.001 --> 02:02:25.925]  They get all the money, and then people who have broken backs don't get any of it, and then if you're a foreigner, you come here, and you get a decade of tax exemption.
[02:02:26.245 --> 02:02:27.645]  Why don't citizens get that?
[02:02:27.946 --> 02:02:32.988]  It's designed to get rid of the middle class, drive down our wages, get all of us on welfare...
[02:02:33.349 --> 02:02:34.678]  Or in the criminal justice system.
[02:02:34.718 --> 02:02:35.302]  Paul Watson?
[02:02:35.928 --> 02:02:42.133]  Well, it boils down to the fact that it's nothing more than slave labour like the sweatshops in India.
[02:02:42.493 --> 02:02:46.796]  It's not just exploiting and bringing down the country in America.
[02:02:46.816 --> 02:02:52.700]  It's exploiting via what is slave labour on the wages that they get when this outsourcing takes place.
[02:02:52.741 --> 02:03:04.009]  I mean, the excuse with this amnesty deal that the Mexicans are coming in to do the lower-paid jobs is defeated by that very fact that all the lower-paid jobs are being taken out of the country anyway.
[02:03:04.795 --> 02:03:04.995]  Yes.
[02:03:05.035 --> 02:03:14.384]  Well, if you people are in the same situation as I am, make that phone call and tell me you want a letter from the commissioner of what the status is on your claim and why you're getting jerked around also.
[02:03:14.464 --> 02:03:14.824]  All right.
[02:03:15.465 --> 02:03:16.465]  Thanks for the call.
[02:03:16.505 --> 02:03:19.528]  Let's talk to Dan in Illinois.
[02:03:19.608 --> 02:03:20.409]  Dan, go ahead.
[02:03:20.429 --> 02:03:21.350]  How are you doing there, Alex?
[02:03:21.490 --> 02:03:21.750]  Good.
[02:03:22.271 --> 02:03:23.832]  You know, this all proves one thing.
[02:03:23.852 --> 02:03:27.195]  You just can't give corporations that type of freedom.
[02:03:27.694 --> 02:03:29.095]  I mean, they just can't be trusted.
[02:03:29.175 --> 02:03:32.196]  I mean, there's no laws against this, but there should be.
[02:03:32.336 --> 02:03:34.077]  No, you don't regulate the corporations.
[02:03:34.177 --> 02:03:44.481]  What you do is you keep the government so small it can't start giving them corporate welfare, and even if they take over the government, the government's not big enough to control our lives.
[02:03:44.501 --> 02:03:45.182]  Do you understand that?
[02:03:45.542 --> 02:03:46.862]  Well, here's the thing.
[02:03:46.962 --> 02:03:52.505]  If the people are not demanding the government to control the corporations, then the corporations will demand that the government control us.
[02:03:53.005 --> 02:03:54.126]  That's what's happened.
[02:03:54.206 --> 02:04:05.331]  So the founding fathers said, you stop that by having a small government, then they even seize control, or a dictator seizes control, or a corporate oligarchy seizes control of the levers of power.
[02:04:05.511 --> 02:04:09.153]  The levers of power are so small, they can't take over your life.
[02:04:09.513 --> 02:04:13.335]  So instead, they're expanding the levers of control because they have taken over.
[02:04:14.315 --> 02:04:19.418]  The fact that they're allowed to export so many things, there should be regulation.
[02:04:20.198 --> 02:04:26.922]  But see, they already run the government, so when you give them regulation, they're going to use that selectively against you.
[02:04:26.942 --> 02:04:27.542]  Of course.
[02:04:27.942 --> 02:04:28.402]  One more thing.
[02:04:28.442 --> 02:04:34.365]  Did you see that the Jewish people, some organizations, they say, anybody but Bush?
[02:04:36.627 --> 02:04:39.948]  Well, yeah, there's a lot of diverse groups that don't like Bush.
[02:04:39.968 --> 02:04:41.769]  It kind of surprised me, though.
[02:04:41.789 --> 02:04:42.530]  70% against.
[02:04:45.029 --> 02:04:46.449]  Oh, yeah.
[02:04:47.310 --> 02:04:49.130]  That's not one monolithic block.
[02:04:49.190 --> 02:04:50.051]  No group is.
[02:04:52.491 --> 02:04:53.211]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:53.231 --> 02:04:53.972]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:04:56.953 --> 02:05:01.634]  We all have busy lives, and sometimes that causes us to miss out on the things that are most important to us.
[02:05:02.154 --> 02:05:05.315]  Well, when it comes to Genesis programs, you'll never have to miss out again.

[02:06:56.836 --> 02:07:01.160]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:05.704]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:10.312]  This disaster is a new world order.
[02:07:10.392 --> 02:07:13.214]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:07:13.454 --> 02:07:17.677]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:07:17.758 --> 02:07:24.663]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:07:24.803 --> 02:07:26.805]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:07:27.225 --> 02:07:37.491]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:07:37.811 --> 02:07:43.155]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:07:57.299 --> 02:07:59.480]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:00.060 --> 02:08:02.960]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:06.841 --> 02:08:07.602]  Paul Watson.
[02:08:10.062 --> 02:08:10.662]  My guest.
[02:08:10.962 --> 02:08:12.023]  Again, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:08:13.463 --> 02:08:16.404]  Coming up, we'll get a report from the border with Mexican troops firing at U.S.
[02:08:16.444 --> 02:08:16.864]  citizens.
[02:08:18.844 --> 02:08:24.746]  Paul, we need to talk about the false left-right paradigm, the false political spectrum of left and right, because...
[02:08:26.471 --> 02:08:29.174]  We were just talking to Dan in Illinois, and then we'll go to these other calls.
[02:08:30.195 --> 02:08:39.024]  Dan in Illinois was saying, well, hey, these corporations are so corrupt, using the government to control us, we've got to pass regulations to control them.
[02:08:40.831 --> 02:08:41.432]  We're good to go.
[02:08:58.920 --> 02:08:59.541]  We're good to go.
[02:09:24.563 --> 02:09:29.006]  Is police, giant prisons, control, regulation, socialism, communism.
[02:09:29.326 --> 02:09:32.668]  The extreme of the right in the false spectrum is fascism.
[02:09:32.708 --> 02:09:38.672]  Police in black uniforms, huge prisons, command and control, regulation, a small group running everything.
[02:09:38.992 --> 02:09:42.194]  It's the same system with different window dressing.
[02:09:42.594 --> 02:09:47.017]  And we weren't taught that spectrum, that false spectrum, until 100 years ago.
[02:09:47.837 --> 02:09:53.341]  And now the Democrats think, oh yeah, the evil corporations, let's grow the size of government to regulate them.
[02:09:54.228 --> 02:09:59.590]  Falling into that trap, the conservatives say, oh no, government bad, corporations good.
[02:09:59.630 --> 02:10:02.391]  Well, then corporations are bad because they're part of the government.
[02:10:02.731 --> 02:10:04.391]  The big ones are running the government.
[02:10:04.891 --> 02:10:06.572]  Can you boil that down for folks, Paul?
[02:10:07.352 --> 02:10:09.613]  Well, what people basically need to understand is that
[02:10:10.163 --> 02:10:18.552]  We advocate limited government, obviously, and free market capitalism as it was supposedly intended by the founding fathers.
[02:10:18.932 --> 02:10:22.496]  Not what we've got today, which is monopoly capitalism.
[02:10:22.837 --> 02:10:30.144]  And yet, most of the left wing don't realise that monopoly capitalism is basically the merging of corporations and government.
[02:10:30.184 --> 02:10:30.545]  So then...
[02:10:31.045 --> 02:10:37.888]  They see capitalism itself as the enemy, so they run to socialism and big government as the answer.
[02:10:38.269 --> 02:10:45.172]  When people call for this sort of thing, I mean, you can take this back 100, 150 years with the Rockefeller Standard Oil.
[02:10:45.552 --> 02:10:57.218]  When people finally found out that it was a monopoly capitalist system that was being set up, Rockefeller just devolved all the Standard Oil, the National Standard Oil Corporation,
[02:10:57.838 --> 02:10:58.859]  We're good to go.
[02:10:58.979 --> 02:10:59.279]  I think?
[02:11:14.611 --> 02:11:21.336]  The fairest, not perfect, no system ever is, but it's the fairest system that we should evolve back towards.
[02:11:21.396 --> 02:11:21.936]  Exactly.
[02:11:21.976 --> 02:11:36.205]  I mean, the meaning well liberals, I don't mean their cynical controllers, they think, oh, you stop the evil corporations with big government when the corporations are lobbying for big government.
[02:11:37.066 --> 02:11:38.307]  Who's up next, Stephanie?
[02:11:40.490 --> 02:11:42.351]  Okay, Richard in Kentucky.
[02:11:42.391 --> 02:11:44.412]  You're on the air, and we'll go to Stacy and others.
[02:11:45.152 --> 02:11:48.014]  Yeah, Alex, good to hear your show.
[02:11:49.374 --> 02:11:56.758]  I remember back last March when the shock and awe campaign started in Iraq.
[02:11:57.618 --> 02:12:00.499]  I heard a lot of people say, let's bomb them into Stone Age.
[02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:05.322]  Well, Stone Age really sticks in my mind if you look at what's going on in California.
[02:12:05.762 --> 02:12:07.943]  There's people being attacked by mountain lions.
[02:12:08.729 --> 02:12:10.249]  All they have to fight with is rocks.
[02:12:11.250 --> 02:12:12.750]  What do you guys think about that?
[02:12:13.310 --> 02:12:17.991]  Yeah, they eat children and women, smaller folks, every year.
[02:12:18.011 --> 02:12:20.432]  Yeah, and that ain't the first time.
[02:12:21.052 --> 02:12:30.954]  And the sicko wildlife people that are being funded by the government to devalue human life and to get us into compact cities, they say you shouldn't be encroaching on their territory.
[02:12:31.014 --> 02:12:31.574]  Yeah, really.
[02:12:32.735 --> 02:12:38.219]  Pumas, mountain lions, rock cats, whatever you want to call them, are not even threatened, folks.
[02:12:38.419 --> 02:12:44.244]  I have seen two or three of them, no, four of them, in East Texas deer hunting.
[02:12:45.304 --> 02:12:49.808]  If I see one in my yard, I'll have a 12 gauge loaded up before you say George W. Bush.
[02:12:52.430 --> 02:12:57.794]  So, you know, we're not supposed to have any guns, and guns are evil and all this and that.
[02:12:57.854 --> 02:12:59.796]  You know, what are you supposed to do, throw rocks at it?
[02:12:59.816 --> 02:12:59.896]  Shh!
[02:13:01.175 --> 02:13:03.597]  They've even had black bears killing people now.
[02:13:03.637 --> 02:13:06.359]  They didn't used to do that, but now they're not afraid of us.
[02:13:06.820 --> 02:13:07.640]  Sure, yeah.
[02:13:08.301 --> 02:13:09.922]  They associate people with food.
[02:13:09.962 --> 02:13:10.523]  You're a goner.
[02:13:11.303 --> 02:13:18.289]  And that always happens in these eastern states or these western states where they've taken and basically domesticated everybody.
[02:13:19.410 --> 02:13:21.692]  A puma doesn't show its face around here.
[02:13:22.472 --> 02:13:23.713]  They sneak around.
[02:13:23.733 --> 02:13:24.274]  Mm-hmm.
[02:13:25.174 --> 02:13:25.314]  Yeah.
[02:13:25.414 --> 02:13:31.736]  And believe me, the times I saw them, it was just for a second or two, and by the time I'd get my rifle up, they'd be gone.
[02:13:32.296 --> 02:13:32.496]  Yeah.
[02:13:33.377 --> 02:13:33.917]  I hear that.
[02:13:34.577 --> 02:13:34.717]  Yeah.
[02:13:35.137 --> 02:13:38.198]  One time I was walking down a path in the middle of the day hog hunting.
[02:13:38.218 --> 02:13:38.978]  It wasn't spring.
[02:13:38.998 --> 02:13:40.099]  It wasn't even deer season.
[02:13:40.119 --> 02:13:43.100]  A huge red wolf jumped out right in front of me.
[02:13:43.500 --> 02:13:43.820]  Yeah.
[02:13:44.740 --> 02:13:45.120]  I'm sorry.
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:45.521]  Go ahead.
[02:13:45.621 --> 02:13:47.301]  They've got to protect them, too, you know.
[02:13:47.641 --> 02:13:48.762]  Yeah.
[02:13:48.802 --> 02:13:49.202]  All right.
[02:13:49.242 --> 02:13:49.902]  Thanks for the call.
[02:13:50.893 --> 02:13:58.744]  Paul, you've got it over in Europe now where you have to play with your pig every day, give it a new toy.
[02:13:58.864 --> 02:14:01.188]  In these pens, what is all that about?
[02:14:01.986 --> 02:14:13.989]  Right, obviously it's about, I mean, the emphasis on animal rights is going on, coming straight out of the government and the big funders of this environmental movement, at the same time where we're losing all our human rights.
[02:14:14.029 --> 02:14:24.211]  I mean, the biggest reaction I get from the left-wingers out there that do listen to us is when I post a story which debunks the global warming situation.
[02:14:24.251 --> 02:14:30.713]  I mean, we had a story out on the weekend that it's the coldest in the North East for like 20 years or so.
[02:14:31.277 --> 02:14:32.758]  Yeah, it's the excuse to start a world energy tax.
[02:14:58.746 --> 02:15:09.371]  And the fact is, and this is consistent throughout all the studies, that at least 46% of the entire Earth's surface has never been encroached on by any humans.
[02:15:09.451 --> 02:15:17.295]  And so the assumption that we're spreading the cities everywhere and tearing down the trees is a complete fallacy.
[02:15:17.335 --> 02:15:19.536]  Well, there are more trees now in the U.S.
[02:15:19.556 --> 02:15:20.957]  than there were 100 years ago.
[02:15:21.717 --> 02:15:24.178]  Yeah, and 46% of the Earth is completely untouched.
[02:15:24.218 --> 02:15:25.739]  So, again, it's a lie.
[02:15:26.460 --> 02:15:29.282]  I want to get back briefly because we got cut short and we'll go to more calls.
[02:15:29.602 --> 02:15:36.446]  This BBC article, terror war could last 50 years and bigger than imagined.
[02:15:36.526 --> 02:15:37.847]  They just say it's never going to end.
[02:15:37.867 --> 02:15:42.810]  There's going to be lots of new terrorists attacking us and the answer is just give all our rights up.
[02:15:42.850 --> 02:15:43.790]  Well, that makes sense.
[02:15:44.470 --> 02:15:51.334]  If the war on drugs gets bigger and there's more drugs on the streets, well, now the war on terror gets bigger and there's going to be more terror.
[02:15:51.354 --> 02:15:53.876]  I mean, they don't want their business to go away, do they?
[02:15:54.679 --> 02:16:13.616]  Well, the shift that you will probably see is that they will move it into the situation in Israel where they have, you know, a suicide bombing every couple of weeks, and so that gives them the necessary permanent state of emergency, which is what the UK government are calling for, and calling to...
[02:16:14.475 --> 02:16:25.258]  Intern people without trial, imprison them without trial with the new civil contingencies bill, which would enable the government to quarantine people, destroy private property.
[02:16:25.318 --> 02:16:26.779]  Yeah, let's go over that.
[02:16:26.819 --> 02:16:28.319]  This came out about three months ago.
[02:16:28.339 --> 02:16:29.820]  Now they're still trying to pass it.
[02:16:29.860 --> 02:16:33.721]  The Queen has been out there promoting it.
[02:16:34.161 --> 02:16:36.161]  And there's a new headline today.
[02:16:36.321 --> 02:16:40.723]  Amendment to CCB bill would detain UK citizens without trial.
[02:16:41.143 --> 02:16:41.743]  Talk about that.
[02:16:42.734 --> 02:16:48.197]  Well, again, it's just a case of them announcing something after the fact that they've already been doing it.
[02:16:48.217 --> 02:17:03.804]  I mean, there are already British citizens imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, and so it's basically a recipe for dictatorship, and the British government badly needs a terrorist attack, not only to push through this, along with the National ID Card, but also...
[02:17:04.264 --> 02:17:08.968]  Well, there's also been discussions of not allowing a referendum in England on the Euro.
[02:17:09.328 --> 02:17:11.310]  They didn't allow referendums in the other member states.
[02:17:28.808 --> 02:17:31.769]  They say they're not allowing it because obviously at the moment they can't win it.
[02:17:31.809 --> 02:17:37.411]  But you look at the referendums in the other countries like Ireland, for example.
[02:17:37.511 --> 02:17:44.253]  If there actually is a referendum and the population votes no, all that they do is have another referendum two years later.
[02:17:44.413 --> 02:17:48.915]  They wouldn't allow a referendum in France or Germany where the majority of the folks were against it.
[02:17:49.255 --> 02:17:52.856]  I mean, if our government wants to do what we want, then why don't they give us a choice?
[02:17:52.896 --> 02:17:56.197]  The majority of Americans are against the free trade area of the Americas.
[02:17:56.577 --> 02:18:14.734]  Yeah, so even if you take their false paradigm of democracy, which is, you know, what the majority want, they're not even following that level of politics, so it's not even a democracy, and the Republic went, and now it's not even a democracy either, so...
[02:18:15.894 --> 02:18:19.557]  Also, there's a big move to get rid of juries in your country.
[02:18:19.577 --> 02:18:20.878]  They're talking about that here.
[02:18:20.938 --> 02:18:22.280]  There's been some new developments there.
[02:18:22.340 --> 02:18:27.885]  And the reason we talk about England so much, folks, is in some cases they're a few years ahead of us and we're ahead of them.
[02:18:28.185 --> 02:18:34.191]  It's the exact same managers and model for New Zealand, Australia, Canada, U.S., and England.
[02:18:34.231 --> 02:18:35.753]  We're all under the same system.
[02:18:36.653 --> 02:18:43.555]  And the British government is attempting to do all this on the basis that our Constitution isn't written.
[02:18:43.595 --> 02:18:46.576]  It evolves from custom law and the Magna Carta.
[02:18:46.616 --> 02:18:53.398]  So the Blair government has been enacting constitutional reform via press release, basically.
[02:18:53.838 --> 02:18:59.159]  And as you mentioned with the juries, they came out and said that they want to also abolish the Lords.
[02:18:59.279 --> 02:19:01.140]  And they only want to abolish the Lords because...
[02:19:02.665 --> 02:19:06.967]  It mainly consists of a sort of traditional right-wing element.
[02:19:07.007 --> 02:19:09.409]  Yeah, they don't want to give up the sovereignty of England.
[02:19:10.109 --> 02:19:18.575]  Yeah, and the Lords are obviously pro-jury rights, and so the government needs to abolish the Lords before it can abolish the jury system.
[02:19:20.536 --> 02:19:21.537]  Unbelievable.
[02:19:22.137 --> 02:19:31.083]  We'll break and come back and take some more calls and get into three or four other important little tidbits here, like report all flyers to be assigned threat rankings.
[02:19:32.182 --> 02:19:34.984]  And this is going to be for your jobs, for your driver's license.
[02:19:35.405 --> 02:19:38.867]  It starts there, but it's admittedly, I've seen Ridge say it, for everything.
[02:19:38.887 --> 02:19:40.068]  It'll be on your ID card.
[02:19:40.348 --> 02:19:41.910]  What level of rights you have.
[02:19:43.211 --> 02:19:44.412]  Talk about discrimination.
[02:19:44.792 --> 02:19:45.312]  Also, U.S.
[02:19:45.432 --> 02:19:47.594]  Army College attacks Bush terror policy.
[02:19:47.614 --> 02:19:48.835]  We'll talk about that as well.
[02:19:49.656 --> 02:19:52.498]  Then we'll go to the border and discuss the invasion.
[02:19:52.578 --> 02:19:53.719]  Stay with us.
[02:19:56.596 --> 02:20:00.379]  Hi, this is Jack Brownrigg with a special offer to listeners of GCN Radio.
[02:20:00.679 --> 02:20:07.624]  Use a Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and a Bill of Rights for your good, not the good of manipulating government agencies.
[02:20:07.924 --> 02:20:09.405]  Take control of your own destiny.
[02:20:09.605 --> 02:20:14.068]  GCN is contracted with Midas Resources for copies of The Citizen's Rulebook.
[02:20:14.249 --> 02:20:15.529]  This is more than a handbook.
[02:20:15.710 --> 02:20:19.032]  It is your guide to a freer life with less governmental interference.
[02:20:19.412 --> 02:20:20.112]  Here's the deal.
[02:20:20.353 --> 02:20:31.598]  Call MRI at 800-686-2237 and obtain two handbooks, one for yourself, one for a friend, and two silver dollars for just $24.95, shipping included.
[02:20:31.838 --> 02:20:37.761]  More than half these coins were melted under the Pittman Act of 1918 and later with a great silver run of the 70s and 80s.
[02:20:39.202 --> 02:20:44.025]  There are less than one of these coins surviving for every 20 persons in the United States.
[02:20:44.365 --> 02:20:46.326]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[02:20:48.607 --> 02:20:50.448]  Ask for the Freedom Handbook Special.
[02:20:50.848 --> 02:20:55.030]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[02:20:55.111 --> 02:20:55.471]  Thank you.

[02:21:04.136 --> 02:21:09.072]  Now everyone knows that in order to have a healthy body, you have to provide a diet of healthy food.
[02:21:09.092 --> 02:21:10.958]  Well the same is true for your mind.

[02:21:55.367 --> 02:21:57.308]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[02:21:57.428 --> 02:22:08.132]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:22:08.512 --> 02:22:13.014]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:22:13.094 --> 02:22:24.418]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:22:24.818 --> 02:22:25.498]  We're good to go.
[02:22:40.163 --> 02:22:46.468]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:22:46.548 --> 02:22:50.731]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:22:50.951 --> 02:22:54.914]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:22:55.514 --> 02:23:01.779]  Maca is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[02:23:02.179 --> 02:23:06.222]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[02:23:06.763 --> 02:23:13.955]  Only recently has science discovered that Maca is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[02:23:14.511 --> 02:23:15.111]  We're good to go.
[02:23:38.479 --> 02:23:41.680]  Folks, we're just trying to raise your awareness to the geopolitical
[02:24:08.948 --> 02:24:16.234]  Folks, we're just trying to raise your awareness of the geopolitical system and the strata of power and what the elite is up to.
[02:24:16.254 --> 02:24:17.815]  That's all this show strives to do.
[02:24:18.416 --> 02:24:21.418]  We're about to go to Stacey in Delaware and West in Colorado and others.
[02:24:21.979 --> 02:24:30.005]  But Paul Watson, I kind of cut you short there at the end of the last hour when you were describing Order Out of Chaos, the book I published, the book you wrote.
[02:24:30.546 --> 02:24:31.967]  It's such an amazing book.
[02:24:32.627 --> 02:24:34.489]  People really need to have this book.
[02:24:34.509 --> 02:24:35.750]  And for those that just joined us,
[02:24:37.052 --> 02:24:40.395]  Describe what's in order out of chaos and why folks should get it.
[02:24:41.356 --> 02:24:43.257]  Well, I mean, why people should get it.
[02:24:44.238 --> 02:24:53.625]  Personally, I've had two separate instances where I've given the book to people who've been in the military 20 years and initially disagreed with everything I said.
[02:24:53.665 --> 02:25:00.370]  They read the book and then apologized to me, and then now they're actually getting involved themselves.
[02:25:00.450 --> 02:25:02.372]  So I've found that it is a vital part.
[02:25:03.436 --> 02:25:06.283]  Keystone to waking people up to what's going on.
[02:25:06.684 --> 02:25:08.388]  Well, Paul, people ask me, you know.
[02:25:09.259 --> 02:25:12.260]  How do 90% of those that see your videos wake up?
[02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:14.981]  Because we don't engage in conspiracy theories.
[02:25:15.021 --> 02:25:16.122]  The truth is out there.
[02:25:16.422 --> 02:25:18.823]  The globalists have been caught doing everything they do.
[02:25:18.883 --> 02:25:22.684]  It's such a big conspiracy that, yes, they get caught.
[02:25:22.764 --> 02:25:23.645]  They leave tracks.
[02:25:23.785 --> 02:25:24.565]  It's public.
[02:25:24.865 --> 02:25:26.466]  This program is public.
[02:25:26.886 --> 02:25:30.747]  And so with the videos and the books, we're able to wake people up.
[02:25:30.887 --> 02:25:32.348]  We have a chance.
[02:25:32.468 --> 02:25:35.389]  And, yes, these are some of the best tools we've got, Paul.
[02:25:36.081 --> 02:25:42.306]  Well, I mean, people just don't understand the pace of the evidence of which this comes out every single day.
[02:25:42.346 --> 02:25:52.333]  We have several smoking guns on different issues which either confirm what we said in the past or, you know, get ahead of us and actually confirm new things that we didn't know.
[02:25:52.353 --> 02:25:57.437]  So people don't understand the pace of the cover-up because, I mean, they've lied so many times.
[02:25:57.457 --> 02:25:58.338]  It's like the old saying,
[02:25:58.918 --> 02:25:59.398]  It's amazing.
[02:25:59.418 --> 02:26:05.440]  I mean, they're just absolute criminals on fire, doing every evil thing you can imagine, running around, looting all of our countries.
[02:26:05.460 --> 02:26:07.661]  I mean, they really have reached the looting phase.
[02:26:07.681 --> 02:26:08.622]  They're just going wild.
[02:26:28.702 --> 02:26:34.168]  I mean, you'd think that they'd be good at lying after, you know, doing it so often, but we got the reverse of that.
[02:26:34.208 --> 02:26:48.785]  I mean, we had the Bremer thing where he was in a public interview dismissing evidence that they'd found weapons of mass destruction labs in Iraq and then blushing and stuttering when the interviewer told him that Tony Blair was saying it.
[02:26:49.225 --> 02:26:58.875]  So these people have lied so often that it's becoming difficult to layer each lie on top of the next and they're becoming forgetful and making all these errors which we're able to pick up on.
[02:26:59.296 --> 02:26:59.957]  Absolutely.
[02:27:00.057 --> 02:27:03.921]  So order out of chaos in just a minute nutshell because then I'm going to Stacey.
[02:27:04.585 --> 02:27:08.867]  In a minute nutshell, what do folks get when they, what will they learn in this book?
[02:27:09.467 --> 02:27:16.410]  Well, I'll start by giving a brief overview of this Hegelian dialectic because obviously a lot of that's been covered in the past.
[02:27:16.810 --> 02:27:31.496]  I tried to stick to issues which have not received that much attention in previous books and videos like the British intelligence MI5 bombings which only came out in dribs and drabs so I brought them all together and did a chapter on that and then we've got
[02:27:32.048 --> 02:27:32.909]  We're good to go.
[02:27:32.929 --> 02:27:33.449]  We're good to go.
[02:27:47.822 --> 02:27:55.164]  The whole left-right thing that we were talking about earlier, about how it's a staged prison to keep people from seeing the greater horizon.
[02:27:55.244 --> 02:27:56.125]  Absolutely, folks.
[02:27:56.165 --> 02:27:56.725]  Get the book.
[02:27:56.825 --> 02:27:59.546]  Infowars.com or prisonplanet.com to order it.
[02:27:59.566 --> 02:28:00.366]  $19.95, second copy, only $11.95.
[02:28:00.406 --> 02:28:01.046]  It's over 300 pages.
[02:28:01.066 --> 02:28:02.427]  1-888-253-3139 or infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[02:28:02.447 --> 02:28:04.848]  Stacey in Delaware, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:28:04.868 --> 02:28:05.068]  Hi, Alex.
[02:28:16.161 --> 02:28:23.882]  I just wanted to comment about the foreigners that come in, and they're able to start businesses, and then they have the tax-free issues.
[02:28:25.823 --> 02:28:29.663]  Actually, my husband and I were in a Dunkin' Donuts, and the guy that owned it was Indian.
[02:28:30.884 --> 02:28:43.406]  My husband got to talking to him, and he was actually very forthright about it, that they come here, they start a business, and then once their time is up, they go back to their country, and another member from their family comes here and starts business.
[02:28:44.013 --> 02:28:44.854]  Takes over the business.
[02:28:45.094 --> 02:28:49.377]  Yeah, number one, they get the seven to ten year exemption depending on which program they decide to take.
[02:28:49.837 --> 02:28:51.658]  And then, I was about to add that earlier.
[02:28:51.718 --> 02:28:52.199]  Good point.
[02:28:52.239 --> 02:28:52.959]  I've talked to them.
[02:28:53.379 --> 02:28:55.201]  Then they sell it to a family member.
[02:28:55.261 --> 02:28:58.483]  They come and get ten more years of tax exemption.
[02:28:58.523 --> 02:29:03.286]  That's why folks, that's discrimination against citizens.
[02:29:04.006 --> 02:29:05.728]  Why would they do something like that?
[02:29:06.008 --> 02:29:10.891]  It is such a sterling example of how much they hate the American people.
[02:29:11.211 --> 02:29:13.172]  And the money that they make here, they don't spend it here.
[02:29:13.193 --> 02:29:13.833]  They spend it home.
[02:29:14.674 --> 02:29:17.877]  So we're paying for them to come here to make money to send it home.
[02:29:18.578 --> 02:29:20.079]  It's not even spent here.
[02:29:20.160 --> 02:29:27.968]  They've set up an economic climate where it's impossible, regardless of what color you are, to be an American citizen and stay in the middle class.
[02:29:28.288 --> 02:29:35.656]  They also use the 40-plus percent profit they get above anybody else to leapfrog it into other businesses to set up monopolies.
[02:29:36.658 --> 02:29:43.163]  Tell you what, Paul Watson, I've got other guests coming up, but I wanted to hold you over one more second to talk about one or two other issues, so stay there.
[02:29:43.623 --> 02:29:45.804]  We've got Ranch Rescue coming on as well.
[02:29:47.165 --> 02:29:48.086]  We're on the march.
[02:29:48.526 --> 02:29:50.167]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.068 --> 02:29:53.750]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:56.764 --> 02:29:58.545]  Got $3 in your pocket?
[02:29:58.765 --> 02:30:01.627]  Want a million dollars in term life insurance coverage?

[02:30:41.753 --> 02:30:47.215]  Remember, $1 million in term life insurance coverage for as little as $3 a day.
[02:30:47.315 --> 02:30:48.476]  Call right now.
[02:30:48.776 --> 02:30:50.336]  Operators are standing by.
[02:30:50.356 --> 02:30:50.796]  800-430-6692 800-430-6692 Late summer, 2003.
[02:31:00.765 --> 02:31:03.887]  Mainstream Press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[02:31:04.267 --> 02:31:07.029]  Late summer 2002, I heard the same thing.
[02:31:07.469 --> 02:31:10.351]  Late summer 2001, you heard the same thing.
[02:31:10.731 --> 02:31:17.855]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently trading in the 93 to 9400 range, is down 7% from two years ago.
[02:31:18.376 --> 02:31:19.276]  That's recovery?
[02:31:19.897 --> 02:31:25.080]  Gold, now trading in the $360 range, is up 31% in that same period.
[02:31:25.480 --> 02:31:27.061]  Where do you want your hard-earned money?
[02:31:27.721 --> 02:31:30.403]  Hi folks, this is Jack Brown with Midas Resources.
[02:31:35.160 --> 02:31:36.741]  I love the sound of real money.
[02:31:37.141 --> 02:31:42.503]  Call your representative today at Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[02:31:42.923 --> 02:31:47.524]  Learn how to protect your assets with real wealth, not potentially worthless paper.
[02:31:47.865 --> 02:31:48.705]  Call now, 800-686-2237.
[02:31:48.745 --> 02:31:48.925]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:31:56.590 --> 02:31:57.872]  Hey, Doris, great news.
[02:31:58.132 --> 02:32:02.357]  I now own my own home, free and clear, and I did it in less than five months.
[02:32:02.477 --> 02:32:03.798]  Did you receive an inheritance?
[02:32:04.019 --> 02:32:04.499]  Well, no.
[02:32:04.639 --> 02:32:09.365]  Actually, I found a way to eliminate my mortgage without bankruptcy and without the need of going to court.
[02:32:09.485 --> 02:32:12.749]  And you, too, can do this legally, lawfully, ethically, and morally.
[02:32:12.829 --> 02:32:15.251]  But, Jim, I signed a note promising to pay back the loan.
[02:32:15.392 --> 02:32:17.394]  Isn't it wrong even if I could discharge the loan?
[02:32:17.634 --> 02:32:22.477]  Doris, I felt the same way until I took the time to learn the truth about money and banking.
[02:32:22.597 --> 02:32:26.479]  The most shocking thing I learned is the fact that no real money is ever loaned out.
[02:32:26.619 --> 02:32:29.301]  There's a dirty secret that the banks don't want you to know.
[02:32:29.481 --> 02:32:33.063]  And this is the basis of how I was able to discharge my own mortgage.
[02:32:33.243 --> 02:32:36.165]  I know this is hard to believe, but go to the website to learn more.
[02:32:36.305 --> 02:32:43.669]  Doris, get your pin and find out how many Americans are finding financial freedom by having their mortgages eliminated in less than five months.
[02:32:43.889 --> 02:32:48.512]  Go to www.eliminatemortgages.com slash liberty.
[02:32:48.652 --> 02:32:51.074]  Just the way it sounds and there's an S after mortgage.
[02:32:51.274 --> 02:32:55.937]  It's www.eliminatemortgages.com slash liberty.
[02:33:08.917 --> 02:33:11.059]  I should have told Stacy in Delaware to hold.
[02:33:11.079 --> 02:33:15.482]  I wanted to hear more of the story, how they go into the Dunkin' Donuts and talk to the man from India.
[02:33:17.063 --> 02:33:24.708]  He brags, yeah, I don't have to pay taxes for 10 years, and I just go back to my country and have another family member come take over the business, and they don't pay taxes for 10 years.
[02:33:25.088 --> 02:33:31.192]  And again, the average person, this has been going on for decades, doesn't even know about this because 60 Minutes isn't going to tell you.
[02:33:31.472 --> 02:33:32.613]  Dan Rather isn't going to tell you.
[02:33:32.633 --> 02:33:33.994]  It's just a quiet little secret.
[02:33:34.454 --> 02:33:38.037]  Why would they do that, and why would a citizen not get that?
[02:33:38.599 --> 02:33:40.741]  It's designed to bring the third world here.
[02:33:41.622 --> 02:33:47.187]  It's designed to displace any existing middle class structure.
[02:33:48.288 --> 02:33:48.889]  And look at it.
[02:33:49.529 --> 02:33:59.078]  Foreigners, whether they're Polish or Russian or German, the majority is Indians because they're really good at it, own almost, and here in Austin I'd say they own about
[02:34:00.740 --> 02:34:01.801]  Let's be conservative.
[02:34:01.821 --> 02:34:06.746]  90% of the gas stations, 95%, I'd have to say 98%.
[02:34:07.607 --> 02:34:09.889]  I've never seen a motel in Austin not owned by Indians.
[02:34:10.630 --> 02:34:13.653]  But again, no one ever asked why that is.
[02:34:13.733 --> 02:34:15.434]  No one ever wondered why that was.
[02:34:16.155 --> 02:34:17.176]  Because they're not stupid.
[02:34:17.216 --> 02:34:17.917]  I don't blame them.
[02:34:17.997 --> 02:34:18.978]  They don't have to pay taxes.
[02:34:19.858 --> 02:34:23.021]  I've never seen a motel that wasn't owned by folks from a foreign country.
[02:34:23.061 --> 02:34:24.402]  Most of the time it's India.
[02:34:49.347 --> 02:34:51.829]  And how did that happen overnight?
[02:34:52.409 --> 02:34:58.132]  Again, this is something we never discuss, and it is massive discrimination against citizens.
[02:34:59.073 --> 02:35:03.796]  Paul Watson, final comments on this, and then one other article, then we're going to go to Jack Foote.
[02:35:04.476 --> 02:35:07.138]  Well, I mean, the key word is invasion.
[02:35:07.178 --> 02:35:11.120]  The key word is not race, because if it was Chinese, Russians, whatever, it doesn't matter.
[02:35:11.553 --> 02:35:19.718]  The key word is invasion because when you boil it down, it's no different than going into Iraq and taking over their economy.
[02:35:19.738 --> 02:35:24.961]  It's the same process and it boils down to an invasion of a country and that's exactly what it is.
[02:35:25.321 --> 02:35:36.848]  And they have set up a climate where they give more welfare, more funding, more everything to illegals and legals of any type while citizens are put under more and more pressure, folks.
[02:35:37.981 --> 02:35:39.782]  So we need to make this an issue.
[02:35:39.802 --> 02:35:41.443]  We need to point this out.
[02:35:50.336 --> 02:35:54.779]  Justices refused a review case on security and 9-11 detentions.
[02:35:54.799 --> 02:36:03.346]  The Supreme Court refused money to consider whether the government properly withheld names and other details about hundreds of foreigners detained in the weeks and months after the September 11th attacks.
[02:36:03.686 --> 02:36:07.969]  The High Court turned down a request to review the secrecy surrounding detainees.
[02:36:08.009 --> 02:36:13.333]  Nearly all Arabs or Muslims who were picked up in the United States following the attacks of the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
[02:36:14.958 --> 02:36:22.323]  And the Washington Study Center, critical of Bush administration response to 9-11, sued to learn the names and other basic information.
[02:36:22.904 --> 02:36:26.646]  But the Supreme Court says, no, we're not going to let that come out, Paul.
[02:36:27.507 --> 02:36:32.330]  Well, yeah, it's the same thing going on in Britain with the detainees without trial.
[02:36:32.811 --> 02:36:41.597]  And I mean, even though in this country most of them get released anyway, it's about creating this false paradigm that there are terrorists running around everyone's backyard.
[02:36:41.617 --> 02:36:44.019]  And I mean, they will try and shut these things up.
[02:36:44.059 --> 02:36:44.419]  They even...
[02:36:45.106 --> 02:36:55.392]  Came out in a Toronto store that they tried to buy off the 9-11 victims to sign legal forms where they wouldn't ask the government about prior knowledge or anything related to that.
[02:36:55.472 --> 02:36:58.274]  Yeah, the headline was, Victims Refuse Bribe.
[02:36:58.294 --> 02:36:59.855]  Yeah, that's what it was.
[02:36:59.915 --> 02:37:04.417]  It was a government bribe not to file lawsuits on the fact that the government carried out the attack.
[02:37:04.938 --> 02:37:07.759]  All right, here's another one out of NBC5.
[02:37:08.180 --> 02:37:11.822]  Report all flyers to be assigned threat ranking...
[02:37:12.711 --> 02:37:17.414]  Volunteering personal information would shorten the security wait.
[02:37:17.514 --> 02:37:24.677]  They admit, this is the CAPS2 system, you've got bad credit, you're going to get more of a search and may not be able to fly.
[02:37:24.697 --> 02:37:35.303]  And I've seen Ridge about a year and a half ago on C-SPAN say, to have a job, you're going to have to have an okay security rating on your driver's license, which is really the national ID card, Paul.
[02:37:35.925 --> 02:37:38.627]  Yeah, and it's all been centralised into the national ID card.
[02:37:38.907 --> 02:37:51.515]  And I can tell people through personal experience that even if you've been involved in a civil routine court case, not criminal, or even if you've got an unpaid parking ticket, or I mean they've even had...
[02:37:51.935 --> 02:37:59.178]  Absolutely, but the borders are going to be wide open, and we're going to accept any fake matricula card, you name it.
[02:37:59.218 --> 02:37:59.819]  It's a fraud.
[02:37:59.859 --> 02:38:06.282]  Paul Watson, thanks for spending an hour with us, and look forward to having you back on next Monday.
[02:38:18.187 --> 02:38:18.987]  Okay, thanks, Alex.
[02:38:19.308 --> 02:38:20.128]  God bless, my friend.
[02:38:20.708 --> 02:38:22.849]  Let's shift gears now to Jack Foote.
[02:38:22.869 --> 02:38:24.330]  He's the founder of Ranch Rescue.
[02:38:24.870 --> 02:38:26.410]  Jack, good to have you on the show.
[02:38:26.751 --> 02:38:27.591]  Good to be back, sir.
[02:38:27.611 --> 02:38:28.631]  Thank you for the opportunity.
[02:38:28.831 --> 02:38:29.312]  You bet.
[02:38:29.332 --> 02:38:31.352]  We'll have you on in the future for a little bit longer.
[02:38:32.013 --> 02:38:38.135]  For those who don't know what Ranch Rescue is, describe the organization, what you do, and we'll get into the Mexican troops firing at your members.
[02:38:39.336 --> 02:38:42.337]  Briefly, Ranch Rescue is a private property rights advocate.
[02:38:43.260 --> 02:38:51.286]  And everything we're going to talk about today is available to your listeners on our website at www.ranchrescue.com.
[02:38:52.267 --> 02:38:59.372]  We are conducting Phase 2 of Operation Thunderbird here on Private Ranch in Cochise County, Arizona.
[02:38:59.672 --> 02:39:08.619]  Your listeners may recall Cochise County, Arizona is the number one illegal border crossing point into the United States and has been for the past five years.
[02:39:09.659 --> 02:39:10.080]  On December 20th,
[02:39:10.931 --> 02:39:18.074]  Our volunteers were conducting a reconnaissance patrol in the southern part of our host's land, which is right up next to the border road.
[02:39:18.975 --> 02:39:31.781]  Mexican troops, armed and in uniforms, OD Green uniforms and OD Green Kevlar helmets, crossed onto our host's property and were challenged verbally by our reconnaissance team.
[02:39:32.741 --> 02:39:35.783]  The Mexican troops, there's about 10 of them we estimate.
[02:39:35.823 --> 02:39:40.645]  We know for certain there were two in the lead with AK-47 and RPK machine guns
[02:39:41.465 --> 02:39:47.214]  The rest of them retreated back into the wood line, and after they got themselves into a concealed position, they fired on our volunteers.
[02:39:47.975 --> 02:39:49.798]  Unfortunately, none of our volunteers were hit.
[02:39:50.579 --> 02:39:53.944]  Our volunteers, to their credit, exercised remarkable restraint.
[02:39:55.042 --> 02:40:01.045]  No, that did make the Associated Press and Newsmax, but the average person hasn't heard about it.
[02:40:01.405 --> 02:40:08.308]  They cover it up when federal officers are being routinely killed, Border Patrol, FBI, Forestry Service people.
[02:40:08.648 --> 02:40:10.729]  They've shot up dozens and dozens of vehicles.
[02:40:10.789 --> 02:40:17.432]  Tom Tancredo, the congressman, says there's been over 190 episodes of this in the last two years that he knows of.
[02:40:17.452 --> 02:40:18.973]  He didn't even know about U.S.
[02:40:19.013 --> 02:40:21.254]  citizens three miles over the border being kidnapped.
[02:40:21.894 --> 02:40:26.017]  ...in December by Mexican troops for absolutely no reason.
[02:40:26.217 --> 02:40:27.557]  They're bringing the drugs across.
[02:40:28.498 --> 02:40:31.980]  What did the police and others do once you reported this?
[02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:37.323]  The silence is deafening every time you try to report something like this.
[02:40:37.403 --> 02:40:41.425]  So we gave up trying to report these incidents a long time ago.
[02:40:41.705 --> 02:40:45.647]  We don't dial 911 out here because, quite frankly, it's a waste of time.
[02:40:45.727 --> 02:40:48.469]  We are next-door neighbors to the largest...
[02:40:49.062 --> 02:40:49.622]  We're good to go.
[02:40:49.642 --> 02:40:49.943]  I think?
[02:41:17.938 --> 02:41:20.720]  Or we do it ourselves with volunteers here on this property.
[02:41:20.740 --> 02:41:21.260]  That's what you do.
[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:26.624]  You go to private property that have giant footpaths and garbage everywhere where the illegals pour across.
[02:41:26.664 --> 02:41:31.107]  They rob, they rape, they kill people, they break equipment, they kill farm animals.
[02:41:32.227 --> 02:41:37.211]  These are what our national government now refers to as future foreign guest workers.
[02:41:38.191 --> 02:41:40.533]  And they are coming across just in the last 72 hours.
[02:41:41.393 --> 02:41:43.855]  I'm looking at one of our guys in the observation tower right now.
[02:41:43.975 --> 02:41:46.757]  Just in the last 72 hours, we have seen
[02:41:47.757 --> 02:41:53.240]  A dramatic increase in the numbers of criminal border crossers coming across our property.
[02:41:53.300 --> 02:41:56.721]  Well, that's because the Mexican papers say, hey, we're taking over.
[02:41:57.221 --> 02:42:02.304]  The New York Times on Friday said this land is our land and said, hey, don't complain.
[02:42:02.344 --> 02:42:03.484]  This is really Mexico.
[02:42:04.105 --> 02:42:05.745]  Even our own government says yes.
[02:42:06.746 --> 02:42:07.486]  It's amazing.
[02:42:07.967 --> 02:42:10.548]  Now, I know you've done a lot of radio interviews.
[02:42:11.048 --> 02:42:15.630]  I heard one of your listeners earlier ask about my interview on National Alliance.
[02:42:16.050 --> 02:42:16.330]  Yes.
[02:42:16.611 --> 02:42:17.031]  For the record.
[02:42:17.762 --> 02:42:26.305]  For the record, I am very aware, and I was aware before I did this interview, of the controversy that would happen from me being on this particular source.
[02:42:26.425 --> 02:42:32.627]  However, I was also interviewed by Hal Turner a couple of years ago, and on that same day, I was interviewed by CNN.
[02:42:33.248 --> 02:42:37.849]  I no more subscribe to the Hal Turner's viewpoint than I do the Ted Turner's viewpoint.
[02:42:38.630 --> 02:42:42.451]  These people are offering me an opportunity to get the message out, and I took it.
[02:42:43.271 --> 02:42:45.052]  Regardless of what their own political views are.
[02:42:45.112 --> 02:42:48.255]  Sir, you must have gotten a call then because it's not that big of a deal.
[02:42:48.575 --> 02:42:57.642]  I mean, I said I'll be interviewed by the German press, the Chinese press, the right-wing press, whoever, to get the word out about being shot at by Mexican troops.
[02:42:57.782 --> 02:42:58.742]  Everybody needs to know.
[02:42:58.782 --> 02:43:00.684]  I mean, it's like Paul Revere.
[02:43:01.324 --> 02:43:02.905]  Probably didn't agree with some of the people.
[02:43:02.945 --> 02:43:06.747]  He was riding by their house, yelling to arms to arms, the Redcoats are coming.
[02:43:06.968 --> 02:43:08.028]  So I see what you were saying.
[02:43:08.048 --> 02:43:14.452]  I just want to make it clear that later the media, you need to make clear on record, can take that and go, oh, look, he's involved with that.
[02:43:14.852 --> 02:43:22.117]  That's exactly what they love to do is try to, you know, they've tried to mix the issue of sovereignty in with that.
[02:43:22.697 --> 02:43:29.601]  Well, what we're seeing is that every time they throw up this charge of racism, it is thrown up for the express purpose of
[02:43:30.254 --> 02:43:34.057]  ...of diverting public attention from the real issue of crime on private property.
[02:43:34.077 --> 02:43:35.798]  Well, that's exactly what's happening.
[02:43:35.838 --> 02:43:39.341]  I mean, Mexico, the government is racist.
[02:43:39.541 --> 02:43:45.545]  Public newspapers are saying, throw the gringos out, but that's supposed to be cute, and it's not acceptable.
[02:43:45.885 --> 02:43:53.591]  I've had a standing offer for the past three and a half years to publicly debate anyone about what we do within Ranch Rescue, what we stand for, and who we are.
[02:43:54.171 --> 02:43:59.655]  One of our chief detractors, Isabel Garcia, who's a local personality here in southeastern Arizona...
[02:44:00.256 --> 02:44:01.657]  They run away, and they make...
[02:44:29.505 --> 02:44:33.625]  Wild accusations, but they cannot back those up with valid arguments.
[02:44:35.423 --> 02:44:42.708]  Well, I know that's the case, and I know that we're always talking about Mexico because that's the majority, but it's just as bad from India or Russia or anywhere else.
[02:44:43.248 --> 02:44:44.409]  We're losing this country.
[02:44:44.429 --> 02:44:50.692]  We're losing our wages, and we cannot assimilate this mass this fast, and now Bush is going to legalize all of them.
[02:44:51.633 --> 02:44:54.795]  So what are your guys going to do the next time Mexican troops shoot at them?
[02:44:55.175 --> 02:44:57.737]  I know if Mexican troops were shooting at me, I know what I'd do.
[02:44:58.117 --> 02:45:04.681]  Well, like I said, I commend the individual patrol team leader for his discretion and his restraint, and it was his call to make.
[02:45:05.222 --> 02:45:06.123]  We're good to go.
[02:45:06.143 --> 02:45:06.283]  I think?
[02:45:30.396 --> 02:45:31.600]  We will open fire on them.
[02:45:31.781 --> 02:45:32.724]  We will not warn them.
[02:45:33.045 --> 02:45:37.097]  Now, folks, I think that's a radical statement that shows how neutered we've all become.
[02:45:38.457 --> 02:45:39.658]  It's private property.
[02:45:39.718 --> 02:45:41.700]  It's being invaded by foreign troops.
[02:45:42.140 --> 02:45:48.486]  If anybody was on your property, especially armed, you have every right to defend yourself with lethal force.
[02:45:48.526 --> 02:45:50.008]  Now, that's just the law in Texas.
[02:45:50.068 --> 02:45:51.129]  It's the law in Arizona.
[02:45:51.409 --> 02:45:52.690]  It's been a law nationwide.
[02:45:52.730 --> 02:45:56.914]  Now they're trying to get rid of it in many of the controlled eastern and west coast states.
[02:45:56.934 --> 02:46:01.899]  Under state law, we may not use or threaten to use deadly force unless it's first used or threatened to be used against us.
[02:46:02.526 --> 02:46:05.469]  On the case of civilian criminals, that means they have to point a weapon at you.
[02:46:05.669 --> 02:46:08.211]  Now, did you make the police come out and do a report?
[02:46:09.111 --> 02:46:10.232]  Not for this particular incident.
[02:46:10.252 --> 02:46:11.173]  There was no point to it.
[02:46:11.373 --> 02:46:16.617]  We didn't have any physical evidence, except some very scared looks on the faces of our volunteers who had been fired upon.
[02:46:18.299 --> 02:46:21.341]  But, I mean, it's not like this isn't happening.
[02:46:21.361 --> 02:46:29.388]  We have them running over fences, chasing Border Patrol seven miles, and shooting their vehicles full of holes, and killing people.
[02:46:29.728 --> 02:46:29.888]  Right.
[02:46:29.948 --> 02:46:30.889]  We'll be happy to call.
[02:46:31.610 --> 02:46:32.892]  Why do you think they shot at you?
[02:46:32.912 --> 02:46:33.452]  Because they can.
[02:46:33.913 --> 02:46:38.238]  Because they know that even if they hit one of us, if they commit a murder inside the United States...
[02:46:51.141 --> 02:46:56.523]  They can run back into Mexico, and Mexico will never extradite them to face either the life or the death penalty.
[02:46:56.664 --> 02:47:01.085]  And then it makes it... Also, there's a government... And this has been out there.
[02:47:01.126 --> 02:47:03.927]  I've talked to one of the top Border Patrol people here in Texas.
[02:47:03.987 --> 02:47:05.047]  He's one of my dad's patients.
[02:47:05.507 --> 02:47:09.129]  He said, oh, yeah, there's a $200,000 bounty on Border Patrol.
[02:47:09.669 --> 02:47:14.211]  But Bush is down there in a love fest with Vicente Fox right now.
[02:47:15.092 --> 02:47:19.814]  Our volunteers are better equipped and better deployed than the Border Patrol itself.
[02:47:20.529 --> 02:47:26.674]  We have highly different rules of engagement when it comes to armed, uniformed, foreign military troops.
[02:47:27.034 --> 02:47:29.656]  And we know some of the local... Rules of engagement are much different than those for civilians.
[02:47:29.856 --> 02:47:42.226]  We know some of the local folks have detained tens of thousands on their ranches, and we know that there's Simcox Group, we know that there's American Patrol out there documenting all this.
[02:47:42.526 --> 02:47:48.671]  How many people that are trespassing on one ranch have you guys put under citizen's arrest and called the police?
[02:47:49.352 --> 02:47:53.495]  Most of the folks who come across here are just your simple illegal border crossers.
[02:47:53.535 --> 02:47:55.596]  They don't represent a threat because they're not armed.
[02:47:56.117 --> 02:47:58.338]  The last group that we encountered was a group of five.
[02:47:59.018 --> 02:48:02.781]  We simply gave them food and water and evicted them from the property and told them not to come back.
[02:48:02.941 --> 02:48:05.403]  Yeah, and now you've got Morris Dees suing you, right?
[02:48:05.963 --> 02:48:10.826]  Well, Morris Dees is suing me and the current owner of the ranch that I'm sitting on, Casey Nethercott.
[02:48:11.427 --> 02:48:14.709]  But those stem from an incident that occurred in Texas, not here in Arizona.
[02:48:15.389 --> 02:48:17.891]  The owner, by the way, is still sitting in...
[02:48:19.591 --> 02:48:26.076]  And by the way, there was a French national reporter there.
[02:48:26.457 --> 02:48:28.118]  You guys, and this was on tape.
[02:48:28.478 --> 02:48:30.100]  The reporter caught it, took photos.
[02:48:30.380 --> 02:48:31.381]  This was in the French news.
[02:48:31.841 --> 02:48:34.303]  Gave them blankets, helped them, said, go on down the road.
[02:48:34.724 --> 02:48:35.905]  Don't trespass again.
[02:48:35.925 --> 02:48:38.027]  And it looks like that was a staged deal.
[02:48:38.067 --> 02:48:39.288]  Suddenly the police show up.
[02:48:39.728 --> 02:48:43.471]  This was, what, four or five months ago, and this guy's still in jail.
[02:48:43.651 --> 02:48:46.614]  Yeah, well, he was arrested a second time from...
[02:48:47.521 --> 02:48:51.002]  It's kind of complicated, not to bore your listeners, but basically he was free on bail.
[02:48:51.602 --> 02:48:53.263]  He was here in Arizona at his new place.
[02:48:54.323 --> 02:48:59.945]  And false statement was filed by the prosecutor in Jim Hogg County, Texas.
[02:49:00.645 --> 02:49:03.986]  Rudy Gutierrez perjured himself by filing false charges with the FBI.
[02:49:04.206 --> 02:49:06.527]  He wrote them a letter saying Casey did this, that, and the other thing.
[02:49:07.207 --> 02:49:10.668]  The feds then took that information, placed Casey under arrest here in Arizona.
[02:49:11.628 --> 02:49:16.370]  And when they went back to Mr. Gutierrez and asked him to testify, he refused to.
[02:49:17.516 --> 02:49:34.145]  By the way, this is the same South Texas where four towns fly the Mexican flag, not the American flag, and do not allow English in-court proceedings.
[02:49:34.766 --> 02:49:34.986]  Right.
[02:49:35.226 --> 02:49:45.872]  Now, this is, in the particular case of Jim Hogg County, in the town of Hebronville, this is a county government that is really nothing more than an organized criminal enterprise
[02:49:46.482 --> 02:49:49.643]  Disguised itself and masquerading as a legitimate government.
[02:49:49.823 --> 02:49:50.123]  Okay.
[02:49:50.143 --> 02:49:52.184]  They earned the name Texas Taliban.
[02:49:53.504 --> 02:49:53.904]  All right.
[02:49:54.204 --> 02:49:55.905]  Jack Foote, give folks the website.
[02:49:55.945 --> 02:49:58.606]  I'm going to get you back on in the future for a full hour so we can take calls.
[02:49:58.646 --> 02:50:00.466]  What's the website again?
[02:50:00.666 --> 02:50:04.248]  The website address is www.ranchrescue.com.
[02:50:04.268 --> 02:50:09.329]  The phone number here at Camp Thunderbird is 520-364-3966.
[02:50:09.549 --> 02:50:14.931]  And we are asking folks to come as volunteers and to send us donations.
[02:50:15.814 --> 02:50:16.154]  All right.
[02:50:16.194 --> 02:50:17.995]  Well, thanks a lot for coming on the show, Jack.
[02:50:18.175 --> 02:50:18.955]  Thank you again, sir.
[02:50:18.975 --> 02:50:19.615]  Much appreciated.
[02:50:19.675 --> 02:50:20.036]  You bet.
[02:50:20.216 --> 02:50:22.676]  And I've checked out the whole story they're telling.
[02:50:22.696 --> 02:50:26.298]  I mean, there was a national French reporter from AFP.
[02:50:26.898 --> 02:50:28.518]  That's their Associated Press there.
[02:50:29.519 --> 02:50:34.681]  And they go out, stop a couple people.
[02:50:35.241 --> 02:50:35.861]  They're cold.
[02:50:36.761 --> 02:50:39.282]  They give them some blankets, say, don't come back on this property.
[02:50:39.682 --> 02:50:41.223]  And luckily, there was a French reporter there.
[02:50:41.263 --> 02:50:43.984]  This was all caught on tape and with photos.
[02:50:45.903 --> 02:50:50.185]  And good thing the French reporter was still there when the police came and arrested him for assaulting him.
[02:50:50.225 --> 02:50:51.826]  I mean, it's nuts.
[02:50:51.926 --> 02:50:53.787]  But Mexican troops kill federal officers?
[02:50:54.227 --> 02:50:55.828]  Doesn't even make the news.
[02:50:56.748 --> 02:51:01.070]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:51:01.270 --> 02:51:05.692]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:51:05.852 --> 02:51:07.073]  There is a chance.
[02:51:07.854 --> 02:51:10.217]  Use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:51:10.257 --> 02:51:13.060]  The New World Order can emerge.
[02:51:13.401 --> 02:51:17.606]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:51:17.686 --> 02:51:24.614]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:51:24.754 --> 02:51:26.757]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:51:26.997 --> 02:51:37.502]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:51:37.722 --> 02:51:43.105]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:53:59.261 --> 02:54:02.062]  All right, let's jam a few final calls in here.
[02:54:02.123 --> 02:54:03.523]  Wes, Ron, and maybe others.
[02:54:03.824 --> 02:54:05.465]  Wes in Colorado, you're on the air.
[02:54:05.565 --> 02:54:06.025]  Go ahead.
[02:54:06.045 --> 02:54:06.966]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:06.986 --> 02:54:07.726]  Good to talk to you.
[02:54:07.926 --> 02:54:08.346]  You bet.
[02:54:08.446 --> 02:54:09.687]  I want to thank you for your work.
[02:54:09.747 --> 02:54:11.368]  I've got two quick things to mention.
[02:54:12.089 --> 02:54:19.773]  One is a good way to get out the word is to get some business cards made up either on your own home computer or somewhere else.
[02:54:19.793 --> 02:54:23.796]  And what you can do is if you love America, check it out and then write down
[02:54:24.289 --> 02:54:27.133]  Infowars.com, PrismPlanet.com.
[02:54:27.694 --> 02:54:32.480]  Also, the times and station and days where you're broadcast locally.
[02:54:33.822 --> 02:54:35.464]  And leave those cards out around town.
[02:54:36.645 --> 02:54:40.130]  Well, that works really well in areas where we have AM and FM affiliates.
[02:54:41.042 --> 02:54:44.044]  And certainly folks can always listen over the Internet or shortwave.
[02:54:44.084 --> 02:54:49.967]  And, yeah, a lot of folks are doing that, and this show is only one small part of the solution against this tyranny.
[02:54:49.987 --> 02:54:51.588]  But, yes, that's a wonderful idea.
[02:54:52.028 --> 02:55:01.714]  Another thing is community fairs, when they have those, you can always rent a table and have download pages that people can read there and handouts also to people for free.
[02:55:02.454 --> 02:55:04.976]  Another thing I wanted to mention was you mentioned about Bush.
[02:55:06.356 --> 02:55:08.898]  Recently I saw WWE had a wrestling tournament.
[02:55:09.565 --> 02:55:10.425]  Okay, and what does that mean?
[02:55:10.445 --> 02:55:11.326]  I think it's a biblical reference.
[02:55:11.346 --> 02:55:12.206]  I believe it is, too.
[02:55:13.547 --> 02:55:14.187]  Just a little odd.
[02:55:14.247 --> 02:55:14.427]  John 3.16?
[02:55:14.467 --> 02:55:15.148]  But it was actually Bush 3.16.
[02:55:40.276 --> 02:55:41.136]  Or is it Romans?
[02:55:41.296 --> 02:55:43.377]  It's tickling my mind.
[02:55:43.497 --> 02:55:45.578]  It's John 3.16.
[02:55:45.698 --> 02:55:47.939]  And what does John 3.16 say?
[02:55:48.059 --> 02:55:52.641]  I think it's the way to know the Father is through the Son.
[02:55:54.522 --> 02:55:55.283]  Something like that.
[02:55:56.123 --> 02:55:56.803]  Oh, yeah.
[02:55:57.644 --> 02:55:59.084]  All right, thanks for the call, Wes.
[02:55:59.384 --> 02:56:00.205]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:56:00.625 --> 02:56:01.005]  That was it.
[02:56:01.345 --> 02:56:02.186]  Okay, thank you, sir.
[02:56:03.026 --> 02:56:04.086]  Ron in Oklahoma.
[02:56:04.166 --> 02:56:04.907]  Ron, go ahead.
[02:56:05.167 --> 02:56:07.528]  God's the love of the world that he gave his only begotten Son.
[02:56:08.823 --> 02:56:10.183]  I think that's done, 316.
[02:56:10.223 --> 02:56:19.465]  But anyway, Alex, what I was going to say first off is people need to get your tapes, your 9-11, your prerequisites.
[02:56:19.945 --> 02:56:23.726]  Let people know what happened at Oklahoma City, 9-11, some of the others.
[02:56:23.826 --> 02:56:25.106]  Get them copied and get them out.
[02:56:25.666 --> 02:56:31.967]  Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos, and Tex Marr's book, Circle of Entry, are the icing on the cake.
[02:56:31.987 --> 02:56:37.568]  They really give you an inside understanding and knowledge of what's going on so you can talk to other people and explain it.
[02:56:38.598 --> 02:56:58.409]  But anyway, what I called about was I see this Moon-Mars trip as a diversion and as a payoff to the Lockheed Martin and other defense contractors, a diversion to keep the people from thinking about what's going on now, the immigration, the bad economy, Iraq, and whatever.
[02:57:01.297 --> 02:57:02.758]  I don't see anything of substance to it.
[02:57:03.178 --> 02:57:05.119]  Yeah, they cover up one big story with another.
[02:57:05.179 --> 02:57:08.001]  They announce the Saddam thing, and he signs the Patriot Act, too.
[02:57:08.882 --> 02:57:16.767]  He goes to Mexico to announce the end of the border, and then he's going to come back the next day and announce a moon-Mars mission, which will get all the attention.
[02:57:16.787 --> 02:57:17.647]  Yeah, that's what they're doing.
[02:57:18.468 --> 02:57:23.691]  Well, here in Oklahoma City, in George Bush's America, we've had a record year for bankruptcies.
[02:57:23.751 --> 02:57:27.053]  Even had a prominent businessman robbing a bank last week.
[02:57:27.313 --> 02:57:29.635]  Couldn't afford to make his payroll and pay his employees.
[02:57:30.253 --> 02:57:30.553]  I think so.
[02:57:45.405 --> 02:57:45.985]  I hear you, Ron.
[02:57:46.005 --> 02:57:46.706]  I've got to let you go.
[02:57:46.786 --> 02:57:47.426]  Great points.
[02:57:47.526 --> 02:58:06.117]  And since you mentioned it, yeah, my films, 9-11 Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State 3, Total Enslavement, Matrix of Evil, go to InfoWars.com, go to PrisonPlanet.com, get the films, make copies, get them to opinion makers, talk show hosts, county commissioners, your pastor, affect change.

[02:58:23.667 --> 02:58:24.568]  Get the books.
[02:58:24.648 --> 02:58:28.231]  Spread the word and support this broadcast.
[02:58:35.416 --> 02:58:36.818]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:58:36.859 --> 02:58:40.344]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2, right here on this same station.
[02:58:40.704 --> 02:58:45.872]  Now get out there and expose corruption and stand up for this republic and be part of history.
[02:58:47.054 --> 02:58:48.695]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:49.035 --> 02:58:54.758]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:58:55.018 --> 02:59:00.141]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:59:00.501 --> 02:59:09.766]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:59:10.126 --> 02:59:15.090]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:59:15.410 --> 02:59:19.433]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:59:19.613 --> 02:59:24.397]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:59:24.757 --> 02:59:30.721]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
