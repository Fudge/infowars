[00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:06.046]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.726 --> 00:00:07.767]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.487 --> 00:00:09.588]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.228 --> 00:00:11.049]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:12.730]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.032]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.573 --> 00:00:21.675]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.337 --> 00:00:25.498]  All right, my friends.
[00:00:25.818 --> 00:00:30.921]  We're already into the third and final hour of this global transmission against tyranny.
[00:00:32.345 --> 00:00:41.017]  And in the last hour, we had Hutton Gibson, expert on the New World Order, and, of course, Father Amel Gibson on, talking about the different key issues.
[00:00:41.801 --> 00:01:06.580]  In this hour, we're joined by Andres von Bulow, and he was the Federal Minister of Defense, or the equivalent of our Secretary of Defense, been in the German government since the 70s, and up until just a few years ago, he was also the Minister of Technology, and he's written a book that, according to Reuters, is a B-bestseller in Germany that translates into 9-11 and the CIA book.
[00:01:08.809 --> 00:01:21.273]  And he's not the only German minister that has said that we're looking at world fascism here and powerful military industrial complex institutions, engineering terror attacks to scare us into submission.
[00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:34.237]  And Andres von Bulow, we are so honored to have someone of your stature and obvious intelligence and your courage on this show.
[00:01:34.317 --> 00:01:35.277]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:01:35.977 --> 00:01:37.798]  Hello, this is Andres von Bulow speaking, yes.
[00:01:39.843 --> 00:01:42.645]  We're going to break here in a few minutes and come back in a longer segment.
[00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:47.649]  But for those that just joined us, tell us a little bit more about yourself and then your book, please.
[00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.254]  Well, I have been 25 years in politics.
[00:01:54.434 --> 00:01:55.115]  Now I'm out.
[00:01:57.376 --> 00:02:04.802]  In the end, I was Minister of Technology before Secretary for Defense.
[00:02:05.763 --> 00:02:07.644]  Then I had to deal in...
[00:02:09.207 --> 00:02:15.750]  In a commission about the East-West transactions about the Secret Service of East Germany.
[00:02:17.231 --> 00:02:21.413]  And this was a very interesting inside story.
[00:02:22.974 --> 00:02:39.962]  Because on the Western side, on doing deals between East and West and violating the laws of economics in Germany, in the European community and the United States,
[00:02:43.825 --> 00:02:47.670]  It was always two parts which were dealing between East and West.
[00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.675]  And this brought me a lot of insight in the Secret Service business.
[00:02:52.336 --> 00:02:55.420]  In fact, I remember reading about the huge investigations you did.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.525]  That was massive international headlines concerning the SCSI.
[00:02:59.285 --> 00:03:02.607]  And how different governments have actually been working with these people.
[00:03:03.208 --> 00:03:06.250]  And if you'd like, you're welcome to get into that as well.
[00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:16.376]  Again, folks, the equivalent of the Secretary of Defense, Minister of Defense in Germany, and then, of course, technology, the head of that, just absolutely amazing.
[00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:24.481]  Your best-selling book, and I wish there was an English translation because I would certainly buy one,
[00:03:25.374 --> 00:03:30.296]  My wife does read German, but please tell us about your book.
[00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:42.782]  Well, I was writing another book, and then 9-11 happened, and it was strange to me watching.
[00:03:42.862 --> 00:03:53.568]  Well, we all were horrified what was going on, and we said, well, it's impossible, and how can a crew of people manage to do such things?
[00:03:53.908 --> 00:03:54.008]  And
[00:03:55.932 --> 00:04:00.014]  At the first hours we didn't know who was it.
[00:04:00.134 --> 00:04:06.876]  Then within hours came out that probably Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda was behind that.
[00:04:07.596 --> 00:04:13.458]  And then within two or three days these 19 people came out.
[00:04:13.798 --> 00:04:16.599]  And my objection was, or my...
[00:04:19.245 --> 00:04:24.253]  Looking at it, to whom make it bring good?
[00:04:24.633 --> 00:04:34.128]  And I found out that it's rather damaging to the Islamist world.
[00:04:35.232 --> 00:04:42.818]  And perhaps it might be not only a terrorist attack, perhaps it might be a covert operation.
[00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:48.003]  And I watched the scenery going on, what the American government is doing.
[00:04:48.023 --> 00:04:49.724]  Minister, Minister, we've got a break.
[00:04:49.744 --> 00:04:50.865]  We'll be back in three minutes.
[00:04:51.886 --> 00:04:53.908]  Absolutely, we'll go into this in great detail.
[00:04:53.948 --> 00:04:54.908]  We're honored to have you.
[00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:57.531]  We're talking to Andres von Muehle.
[00:04:57.551 --> 00:04:57.991]  We'll be back.
[00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:04.992]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:05.653]  Yes.
[00:05:05.953 --> 00:05:10.755]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood, the richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:19.798]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, two ounces of juice have the same nutrition as three pounds of choice garden produce.
[00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:27.661]  The get-up-and-go energy, healing, blood building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.
[00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:30.062]  Hi, I'm Alan Davison at Monocot Wheatgrass.
[00:05:30.162 --> 00:05:30.662]  We're good to go.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:09.304]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:06:09.524 --> 00:06:20.750]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.370]  We're good to go.
[00:06:44.964 --> 00:06:53.446]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:53.686 --> 00:06:57.548]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:57.828 --> 00:06:59.148]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.648 --> 00:07:04.950]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.511]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:12.383 --> 00:07:14.224]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:30.874 --> 00:07:41.338]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:07:41.618 --> 00:07:46.980]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.181]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:07:50.241 --> 00:07:51.001]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:51.021 --> 00:07:51.401]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:51.421 --> 00:07:52.541]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:08:01.194 --> 00:08:03.395]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.955 --> 00:08:06.837]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:08.838 --> 00:08:09.838]  That's right, my friends.
[00:08:09.918 --> 00:08:14.080]  It's eight minutes, ten seconds into this third hour of global transmission.
[00:08:15.075 --> 00:08:32.036]  I am so honored to have on Andres von Bulow, former German Defense Minister, head of their Defense Department, and then, of course, if it'll just a few years ago, the head of their technology system, which is a very high-level post, just as high-level as Defense Minister in Deutschland.
[00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:33.460]  I think we're good to go.
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.322]  I think we're good to go.
[00:08:51.325 --> 00:09:06.217]  And he, of course, was the British Environment Minister who resigned over Tony Blair's fraud and has written articles saying if the globalists didn't carry the attacks out, they certainly funded and allowed them to take place.
[00:09:06.257 --> 00:09:09.599]  So if you've got a brain and look at the evidence, it's clear.
[00:09:09.759 --> 00:09:13.682]  And Minister Von Bulow, a very intelligent individual, has gone over this.
[00:09:13.722 --> 00:09:14.783]  So, sir, you said that...
[00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:38.000]  On the day of the event, you began to look at it, you began to research it, and from your specific expertise of intelligence and military and technology, heading up entire sectors of the world's third largest economy, please discuss for us your research and how you wrote the book and what really happened on 9-11.
[00:09:40.234 --> 00:09:50.182]  At 9-11, I just watched the scenery, and I said, well, there must have gone something very wrongly, the wrong way.
[00:09:52.224 --> 00:09:55.727]  And I watched the TV, for example, and...
[00:09:57.807 --> 00:10:10.690]  In the same minute where the TV showed the planes driving into the World Trade Center, you found these Palestinians dancing and laughing.
[00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:19.372]  And a few days later one could find out that this was a fake.
[00:10:20.472 --> 00:10:24.993]  It was made by a TV crew of the Defense Ministry in Israel.
[00:10:25.689 --> 00:10:33.043]  And they gave candies to the people and they laughed about it and nobody told it and the question for me was
[00:10:33.698 --> 00:10:42.923]  Who brought this TV stuff right in time into the international networks like CNN and CBS and so on and so on?
[00:10:44.244 --> 00:11:00.312]  And then we looked for the... And then the story came up, this has been done by Osama Bin Laden and his Al-Qaeda, and these were 19 people of Muslim background which did this.
[00:11:01.533 --> 00:11:07.079]  You could watch at the passenger list and nobody showed up.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.103]  Not one Arabic name is showing up there.
[00:11:11.184 --> 00:11:18.552]  Then one is interested to see videos because all these 19 passengers must have passed
[00:11:20.127 --> 00:11:22.750]  A lot of video cameras in these three airports.
[00:11:23.351 --> 00:11:30.619]  In Dallas, I think, and Newark, and in Logan in Boston, and in Portland in the north.
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.422]  And you don't get this stuff.
[00:11:33.963 --> 00:11:37.167]  Then we are looking for the black boxes.
[00:11:37.207 --> 00:11:38.048]  We don't get them.
[00:11:39.237 --> 00:11:43.459]  And the story how these World Trade Centers broke down.
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:48.543]  They were constructed against an approach by airplanes.
[00:11:48.963 --> 00:11:57.728]  And the firemen of New York, they were able to come to the floor where the fires were burning.
[00:11:58.729 --> 00:12:06.134]  And the fire commander said, well, I need two teams more to fight these fires, and then it's finished.
[00:12:06.814 --> 00:12:07.595]  So the heat...
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:16.845]  It's impossible that the heat was as high as it has been written in the papers and in all the media.
[00:12:17.485 --> 00:12:22.928]  And then the feds declared that all the firefighter tapes had malfunctioned.
[00:12:23.249 --> 00:12:24.649]  Turns out that wasn't true.
[00:12:24.709 --> 00:12:26.010]  We got copies of them.
[00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.932]  And it did say that the firefighters said the fires were out.
[00:12:29.612 --> 00:12:30.233]  We're good to go.
[00:12:49.907 --> 00:13:00.454]  The owner of the World Trade Center slipped up on TV and said that they blew Building 7 up, the 47-story building that wasn't even hit by an aircraft.
[00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:02.596]  This just broke two weeks ago.
[00:13:02.636 --> 00:13:03.296]  Have you heard this?
[00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:04.997]  You're sure I have heard this?
[00:13:05.077 --> 00:13:06.818]  I follow the whole scenery.
[00:13:07.939 --> 00:13:12.042]  You know, normally it's not coming out in Germany.
[00:13:12.102 --> 00:13:13.563]  It's coming out in your country.
[00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:24.542]  And it's a fascinating background to research via Internet, because all this stuff is broadly spread over the Internet.
[00:13:25.043 --> 00:13:26.364]  So it's very easy to follow.
[00:13:26.425 --> 00:13:30.249]  But in the main media, you don't get a yota about this.
[00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:34.314]  Well, I tell you what, later in this hour, it's only three minutes of audio clips.
[00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:40.254]  We will air from the PBS documentary America Rebuilding where they admit they blew up WTC7.
[00:13:40.534 --> 00:13:53.685]  Now that's important because they said that building fell from fire even though it wasn't hit by a plane and now he slips up and says we decided to demolish it on 9-11 but then the mainstream media just ignores that.
[00:13:53.725 --> 00:13:55.646]  I mean, this is a public admission, sir.
[00:13:56.387 --> 00:14:02.672]  Yeah, especially because the CIA headquarter in New York was within this building and
[00:14:03.521 --> 00:14:04.669]  I think the...
[00:14:06.219 --> 00:14:07.020]  How do you call it?
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:15.245]  The emergency center for the governor, or no, the major mayor of New York was in this building.
[00:14:15.265 --> 00:14:26.733]  And it was not hit by a plane, and the fire was very low, and the surrounding steel constructions were left over.
[00:14:26.793 --> 00:14:33.497]  They didn't collapse, but building number 7 collapsed in the late afternoon at 5 o'clock, I think.
[00:14:33.777 --> 00:14:43.142]  Well, from our internal sources, they were running the attack, sir, out of the building and so conveniently got rid of the evidence in one fell swoop.
[00:14:43.162 --> 00:14:44.143]  This is one theory.
[00:14:44.523 --> 00:14:45.604]  It might be.
[00:14:45.684 --> 00:14:48.865]  It's convincing, but one has to get the whole proof.
[00:14:49.326 --> 00:14:53.428]  But the problem is that the elements for proof are destroyed.
[00:14:54.008 --> 00:14:58.691]  Also... You find them in Japanese cars and in ships of the American Navy.
[00:15:01.111 --> 00:15:12.998]  Also, sir, we have NORAD standing down for an hour and 25 minutes, but when the golfer Payne Stewart went off course for 15 minutes, he was surrounded in 18 minutes by five F-16s.
[00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:14.419]  Why did NORAD stand down?
[00:15:16.514 --> 00:15:35.378]  Well, this is a big question, because it happened in 2001, I think, more than 60 times that FIDO went up to clear what has been done to airplanes, which showed some irregularities.
[00:15:35.398 --> 00:15:37.558]  At 9-11, four planes for two hours
[00:15:42.057 --> 00:15:52.784]  We're able to drive around, fly around, even one hour going in direction to the west, then turn around and then come back.
[00:15:53.525 --> 00:16:00.429]  And the military air force was not able to interdict them.
[00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:02.531]  It's unimaginable.
[00:16:03.051 --> 00:16:09.335]  And the whole story is totally unclear what happened between the Federal Aviation Agency and NORAD.
[00:16:11.232 --> 00:16:11.892]  Absolutely.
[00:16:11.932 --> 00:16:21.475]  Now, I don't know if you've seen the Associated Press, but the CIA was running a drill 15 miles from the World Trade Centers that day of flying jets into buildings in New York and D.C.
[00:16:21.795 --> 00:16:30.398]  My sources inside the Pentagon, the lawyers who represent them, have said on this show that they were told to stand down because it was, quote, just a drill.
[00:16:31.038 --> 00:16:33.239]  That's how you get the good military to stand down.
[00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:38.221]  You tell them, oh, it's just a drill, and that drill was going on at 8.30 in the morning.
[00:16:38.281 --> 00:16:39.341]  Is that not obvious, sir?
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.201]  It's quite obvious, yeah.
[00:16:43.401 --> 00:16:44.202]  It's so strange.
[00:16:44.602 --> 00:16:50.484]  And the most strange thing for me is that after two years you don't have a white book which is documenting everything.
[00:16:50.944 --> 00:17:04.970]  If you are looking for the timetable, for example, you have to make a medium between two or three or five newspapers and radio and TV announcements.
[00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:07.112]  So everything is unclear.
[00:17:07.913 --> 00:17:19.924]  On the other hand, the American government is running, as they call it, a world war against possibly 60 nations without showing what really was the background of 9-11.
[00:17:19.984 --> 00:17:21.245]  For me, it's impossible.
[00:17:22.967 --> 00:17:29.189]  Now, by that, they admit that nine of the 19 hijackers, the BBC says seven, but it's nine are still alive.
[00:17:30.249 --> 00:17:32.309]  Bin Laden has not been convicted.
[00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:34.190]  Bin Laden's known CIA.
[00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:38.051]  You've got Bush meeting with the head of the Bin Laden family that morning in D.C.
[00:17:38.091 --> 00:17:39.111]  at the Ritz-Carlton.
[00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:49.714]  You've got the general of Pakistan, the head of their intelligence, meeting with the House and Senate Intelligence Committee at 8.30 that morning, his second trip in his life to the United States.
[00:17:50.375 --> 00:17:56.404]  You've got the FBI paying for the houses, the cars, the credit cards of the supposed hijackers.
[00:17:56.704 --> 00:18:03.715]  I mean, sir, you've got public officials, Mayor Willie Brown, Joint Chiefs of Staff, told not to fly to New York that day.
[00:18:03.915 --> 00:18:04.677]  That's all admitted.
[00:18:04.717 --> 00:18:05.378]  What do you say to that?
[00:18:06.557 --> 00:18:08.197]  It's all admitted.
[00:18:08.517 --> 00:18:19.980]  So for me, since the official version is not credible at all, it's totally incredible, the second solution is a covert operation.
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:35.223]  And this is a way to influence, to brainwash the American people into a long, long ongoing conflict with the Muslim world in order to get, to bring
[00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:47.815]  For example, to the oil companies, the last oil reserves which we need for the next decades before finally the oil age is going out.
[00:18:49.096 --> 00:19:02.823]  And probably behind this is a philosophy of geopolitical thinking that finally China has to be taken up and China is too big and you have to be able...
[00:19:04.771 --> 00:19:18.059]  This is put down in the idea of a new American century, which has been written by a lot of people which are now in government, like Cheney, like Rumsfeld and others.
[00:19:18.359 --> 00:19:19.840]  Now, sir, we've got a break.
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.702]  We're going to get into the project for the American century, Operation Northwoods.
[00:19:23.742 --> 00:19:24.762]  Are you aware of the U.S.
[00:19:24.782 --> 00:19:27.704]  government plan to carry out 9-11 style attacks?
[00:19:29.964 --> 00:19:31.785]  You mean in Northwood?
[00:19:32.066 --> 00:19:32.526]  Yes, sir.
[00:19:32.866 --> 00:19:33.607]  You're sure I know?
[00:19:34.127 --> 00:19:35.648]  Is that not a key piece of evidence?
[00:19:36.309 --> 00:19:45.176]  Well, this is a key piece of evidence of the thinking of the military, probably in a dialogue with the politics.
[00:19:45.236 --> 00:19:48.278]  Finally, I think Kennedy decided not to do it.
[00:19:48.858 --> 00:19:56.204]  But it was, I think, all of the... Stay there.
[00:19:56.244 --> 00:19:56.905]  We've got a break.
[00:19:57.385 --> 00:19:58.446]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:20:02.506 --> 00:20:04.287]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[00:20:04.787 --> 00:20:08.208]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:09.368]  Let's update.
[00:20:09.888 --> 00:20:14.629]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:17.710]  The NASDAQ in that same time frame is flat.
[00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:19.351]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[00:20:19.371 --> 00:20:21.691]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[00:20:22.212 --> 00:20:23.132]  Today, the U.S.
[00:20:23.152 --> 00:20:25.372]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[00:20:25.773 --> 00:20:27.313]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:20:27.873 --> 00:20:29.854]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283%.
[00:20:31.215 --> 00:20:36.078]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[00:20:37.059 --> 00:20:37.819]  Gold is moving.
[00:20:38.079 --> 00:20:39.240]  Equities are treading water.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.282]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[00:20:42.822 --> 00:20:44.203]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[00:20:44.643 --> 00:20:46.344]  Physical possession, private gold.
[00:20:46.765 --> 00:20:48.746]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[00:20:49.146 --> 00:20:51.267]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[00:20:53.429 --> 00:20:54.269]  Protect yourself.
[00:20:54.529 --> 00:20:55.570]  Protect your loved ones.
[00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:56.270]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.856 --> 00:21:07.079]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:21:07.219 --> 00:21:13.383]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:21:13.683 --> 00:21:22.127]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:21:22.347 --> 00:21:29.371]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:21:29.691 --> 00:21:34.514]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:21:34.714 --> 00:21:40.118]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:21:40.458 --> 00:21:43.540]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:21:43.881 --> 00:21:51.886]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:51.906 --> 00:21:52.446]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:22:00.391 --> 00:22:03.992]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[00:22:04.012 --> 00:22:05.592]  I've tried many, many products.
[00:22:05.812 --> 00:22:08.033]  I have never experienced anything like collagenate.
[00:22:08.533 --> 00:22:12.353]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than eight weeks.
[00:22:12.793 --> 00:22:13.473]  It truly works.
[00:22:13.814 --> 00:22:15.254]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[00:22:15.454 --> 00:22:21.415]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:22:21.495 --> 00:22:27.536]  Vim and Vigor's collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism, and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[00:22:27.916 --> 00:22:28.356]  We're good to go.
[00:22:50.547 --> 00:22:53.769]  And listen, get $25 off a three-month supply of Collagenate.

[00:23:00.813 --> 00:23:01.953]  Let's face facts, shall we?
[00:23:02.154 --> 00:23:05.075]  The only place that bald is beautiful is on cue balls and eagles.
[00:23:05.395 --> 00:23:08.037]  Yet millions continue to suffer through hair loss needlessly.
[00:23:08.337 --> 00:23:09.158]  Now some good news.
[00:23:09.498 --> 00:23:20.086]  NISM International has developed the New Hair Biofactor Stimulating System, a product line of ultra-deep cleansing shampoos and hair stimulating extracts designed to maximize the natural growth cycle of your hair.
[00:23:20.326 --> 00:23:27.272]  NISM New Hair Biofactor Shampoos are the only shampoos guaranteed to reduce and control excessive hair loss within one week.
[00:23:27.532 --> 00:23:28.953]  NISM stimulating extracts

[00:24:01.774 --> 00:24:11.357]  All right, my friend, I'm Alex Jones, your host for the rest of the hour.
[00:24:11.377 --> 00:24:20.519]  We're honored to have Andres von Bulow, former defense secretary and then, of course, former head of technology, Department of Technology in Germany.
[00:24:21.232 --> 00:24:21.592]  We're good to go.
[00:24:21.612 --> 00:24:21.973]  We're good to go.
[00:24:45.823 --> 00:24:55.948]  With the process of you waking up to what happened on 9-11 and researching it, what are some of the other key points that clearly show that it's impossible that these 19 people did this?
[00:24:55.988 --> 00:24:57.108]  We know that's a fraud.
[00:24:57.749 --> 00:25:00.050]  The conspiracy theory is to say they did it alone.
[00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:08.794]  From your intensive research and your understanding of high-level government activities, what do you think really happened on 9-11?
[00:25:10.931 --> 00:25:22.474]  Well, nobody can prove what has happened directly, because if it has been a covert operation, then you don't find proofs.
[00:25:23.075 --> 00:25:25.936]  You will find only indications.
[00:25:26.876 --> 00:25:31.897]  And one of the indications is that everything is right with these 19 people in Osama bin Laden,
[00:25:38.552 --> 00:25:39.713]  Thank you very much.
[00:26:01.191 --> 00:26:10.638]  Pieces of proof are taken away immediately, and a lot of secrecy, a band of secrecy is taken over everything.
[00:26:11.138 --> 00:26:12.199]  And this has happened with 9-11.
[00:26:12.259 --> 00:26:30.451]  Well, that also happened, were you aware in the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune reported this in 93, the FBI cooked the bomb, trained the driver, had an Egyptian security agent doing it for him, had two retarded Muslims, literally retarded, drive the truck and park it, let the bombing go forward,
[00:26:31.291 --> 00:26:43.017]  In Oklahoma City, the same company that destroyed the remnants of the World Trade Center blew up the remnants of Oklahoma City, had that buried under machine gun guard at a private landfill to this day.
[00:26:43.437 --> 00:26:47.299]  They hold the rubble away from the WTC complex to China.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.260]  They wouldn't let you take photographs.
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:50.261]  Yes, exactly.
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:27:06.128]  At the beginning, the engineers were not allowed to go to the steel trusses and so on, and they had a lot of problems, and there was very scarce money.
[00:27:06.168 --> 00:27:17.815]  You know, to clear up the story of Bill Clinton with Monica Lewinsky, the Republican majority gave out 60 millions of dollars.
[00:27:18.765 --> 00:27:20.746]  I think even $17,000 it's now.
[00:27:20.906 --> 00:27:26.748]  And they started with $600,000 to try to find out what happened in 9-11.
[00:27:27.388 --> 00:27:35.571]  And they were taken away from doing research and so on and so on.
[00:27:35.631 --> 00:27:36.751]  And they are upset.
[00:27:36.831 --> 00:27:44.994]  And the Fire Engineer magazine is saying, well, it's totally unbelievable what happened with this accident.
[00:27:46.612 --> 00:27:48.873]  This examination of 9-11.
[00:27:50.073 --> 00:27:52.134]  Well, they say it's a criminal cover-up.
[00:27:53.114 --> 00:27:55.595]  And now, sir, we've turned into a police state.
[00:27:55.615 --> 00:27:58.675]  They can secretly arrest citizens, secretly execute us.
[00:27:58.975 --> 00:28:01.856]  They're building admitted prison camps all over the country.
[00:28:01.896 --> 00:28:02.756]  This is in our news.
[00:28:03.617 --> 00:28:06.377]  I mean, we're turning into something like the Soviet Union here.
[00:28:07.598 --> 00:28:12.419]  I can't comment on this, but what's going on in Guantanamo is like that.
[00:28:13.968 --> 00:28:39.118]  I think, and the problem is if you put people away, like in Guantanamo on Cuba, if you take them away for one or two years without letting a lawyer to them, without showing them what you are reprising to them, without having contacts with families, finally they tell in all court processes
[00:28:39.911 --> 00:28:42.253]  What the FBI is wanting from them.
[00:28:42.393 --> 00:28:48.898]  So you get faked evidence from these kind of people if you behave like that.
[00:28:49.239 --> 00:28:54.563]  Our mainstream news says torture's good, and they say they are torturing people.
[00:28:54.843 --> 00:28:56.144]  That's the Washington Post.
[00:28:56.164 --> 00:28:59.467]  Is that a concern that our government now admits they're torturing?
[00:29:00.612 --> 00:29:03.955]  Well, I'm informed that... I don't know whether they are torturing.
[00:29:04.495 --> 00:29:10.079]  The kind of keeping them is a kind of a torture.
[00:29:10.539 --> 00:29:23.809]  But I'm told that there is an agreement with a lot of states to put these people, for example, to Egypt or to other states where torture is accepted and is done.
[00:29:24.069 --> 00:29:25.170]  And then you get the...
[00:29:27.203 --> 00:29:40.246]  The final outcome out of this torture, and you can produce this before German courts or American courts and try to bring about final judgment.
[00:29:40.266 --> 00:29:40.807]  Well, that's it.
[00:29:40.827 --> 00:29:41.347]  We'll be back.
[00:29:41.407 --> 00:29:42.487]  Long segment coming up.
[00:29:42.947 --> 00:29:44.107]  And we'll get more into your book.
[00:29:44.127 --> 00:29:46.668]  We're honored to have you, Andres von Bulow.
[00:29:47.068 --> 00:29:47.608]  Stay with us.
[00:29:48.448 --> 00:29:49.269]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.289 --> 00:29:50.129]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.517 --> 00:29:58.189]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:03.797 --> 00:31:09.302]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:31:09.702 --> 00:31:13.945]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:31:14.186 --> 00:31:21.211]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:31:21.592 --> 00:31:27.697]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:31:27.837 --> 00:31:29.058]  There are no side effects.
[00:31:29.258 --> 00:31:31.440]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[00:32:05.591 --> 00:32:06.411]  You heard that right.
[00:32:06.471 --> 00:32:09.092]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[00:32:09.252 --> 00:32:10.292]  You don't have to pay them off.
[00:32:10.552 --> 00:32:11.993]  The banks are defrauding you.
[00:32:12.233 --> 00:32:13.693]  Now is the time to fight back.
[00:32:13.873 --> 00:32:16.434]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.

[00:33:04.496 --> 00:33:07.297]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:09.875 --> 00:33:10.716]  All right, folks.
[00:33:11.457 --> 00:33:13.419]  We're talking to Andres Vambulo.
[00:33:13.519 --> 00:33:20.507]  And to make this clear, up until about, what, two years ago, he was the head minister over the Department of Technology.
[00:33:21.408 --> 00:33:29.417]  And before that, in the parliament, he was the head of his parties group on defense.
[00:33:31.986 --> 00:33:34.047]  We're going to take calls coming up here in a few minutes.

[00:33:49.715 --> 00:33:53.797]  Just type it into the search engine or go to the website and link through and buy a copy of 9-11 and the CIA.
[00:33:56.298 --> 00:34:07.887]  If you want my videos, 9-11 Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, and my book, 9-11, Descent into Tyranny, go to Infowars.com, go to PrisonPlanet.com, and get them.
[00:34:08.207 --> 00:34:14.811]  This story is so important that I authorize you to make copies of my films for not-for-profit, not-for-sale purposes.
[00:34:14.952 --> 00:34:15.692]  I want you to get them.
[00:34:15.792 --> 00:34:16.793]  I want you to make copies.
[00:34:16.853 --> 00:34:18.074]  I want you to put them on the Internet.
[00:34:18.694 --> 00:34:19.415]  You've done that.
[00:34:19.575 --> 00:34:24.418]  I want you to air them on local community television stations, which has happened on over 400 now.
[00:34:26.397 --> 00:34:29.278]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:29.538 --> 00:34:31.019]  Get 9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[00:34:31.079 --> 00:34:32.059]  Get Masters of Terror.
[00:34:32.099 --> 00:34:33.559]  Get my book, Descent to Tyranny.
[00:34:33.579 --> 00:34:36.260]  Get Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos, that I published.
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:37.361]  They're excellent.
[00:34:38.081 --> 00:34:44.363]  The toll-free number to order is 1-888-253-3139.
[00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:51.065]  Because if we don't expose the globalists who clearly carried the attacks out, they're going to carry out more terror.
[00:34:52.085 --> 00:34:53.748]  And they're setting up this police state.
[00:34:54.108 --> 00:35:02.681]  The survival of America and frankly the world is at stake because if the globalists can use our military as their arm to attack 63 countries, it's over.
[00:35:03.374 --> 00:35:04.355]  So again, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:35:04.375 --> 00:35:06.016]  The films are $25.95 apiece, $20.
[00:35:06.136 --> 00:35:08.297]  When you order three or more, my book is $12.
[00:35:08.337 --> 00:35:09.718]  Again, Infowars.com or net, or 1-888-253-3139.
[00:35:09.758 --> 00:35:11.399]  Now, going back to Andres von Bulow,
[00:35:27.693 --> 00:35:33.258]  Sir, we were talking during the break, and I said, what are some of the other key points that you'd like to go over?
[00:35:33.318 --> 00:35:37.741]  You mentioned the CIA and insider trading and the anthrax attacks.
[00:35:37.821 --> 00:35:38.802]  Please discuss it.
[00:35:40.003 --> 00:35:49.710]  Well, the insider trading, everybody knows that there were news about insider trading.
[00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:55.014]  I think altogether about $15 billion of dollars.
[00:35:55.939 --> 00:36:11.446]  And there was speculation about the going down of United Airlines and American Airlines, both airlines which were touched by 9-11, and other things.
[00:36:11.606 --> 00:36:19.069]  And so normally you could find out, because I think the American...
[00:36:20.781 --> 00:36:38.994]  The CIA, together with the financial department, the Treasury, they developed this FinCEN, watching the markets, to find out speculation about going on terrorist attacks.
[00:36:39.955 --> 00:36:45.179]  So they could immediately find out there's something going on, and they could find out.
[00:36:45.726 --> 00:36:58.843]  And in this case, in 9-11, the NSA people, which are the guys watching via satellites the whole transactions going on on Earth, they told...
[00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:03.192]  The people to destroy the tapes.
[00:37:03.272 --> 00:37:08.296]  They had tapes about this interior trading and they said we have to destroy them.
[00:37:08.376 --> 00:37:10.698]  So they are not there any longer for proof.
[00:37:10.979 --> 00:37:18.966]  Now again, interior trading, that's a good term for it, insider trading or interior trading going on here.
[00:37:19.786 --> 00:37:22.547]  And $15 million, I think that's a low estimate.
[00:37:23.268 --> 00:37:24.388]  It came out the first week.
[00:37:24.628 --> 00:37:25.709]  Germany reported on it.
[00:37:25.809 --> 00:37:26.589]  France, the U.S.
[00:37:26.709 --> 00:37:27.629]  Oh, we're going to catch them.
[00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:30.591]  Record put options against United and American.
[00:37:30.911 --> 00:37:34.652]  Not against other airlines, but specifically against these.
[00:37:34.692 --> 00:37:36.333]  And it led back to the CIA.
[00:37:36.393 --> 00:37:37.674]  Suddenly they destroy the evidence.
[00:37:38.114 --> 00:37:38.494]  Again.
[00:37:39.014 --> 00:37:39.394]  Again.
[00:37:39.975 --> 00:37:41.475]  Another smoking gun.
[00:37:41.555 --> 00:37:43.296]  Then you get into anthrax attacks.
[00:37:43.396 --> 00:37:44.557]  Bush on Cipro.
[00:37:44.857 --> 00:37:46.678]  The most weaponized anthrax ever seen.
[00:37:46.938 --> 00:37:47.698]  Tell us about that.
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:54.581]  Well, there the question just is, who has the responsibility for this?
[00:37:54.662 --> 00:38:03.604]  Because, you know, it overlaid the whole public debate, what was the background and the reason for 9-11, for weeks.
[00:38:04.124 --> 00:38:11.946]  Because these attacks were going on for weeks and weeks and weeks, and finally nothing came out.
[00:38:12.066 --> 00:38:15.767]  We have no report on who was responsible, who did it,
[00:38:16.747 --> 00:38:19.208]  And this, again, is amazing.
[00:38:19.228 --> 00:38:27.170]  I think it belongs probably to the cover-up, the psychological cover-up of the whole scenery.
[00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:38.554]  And then the Vice President and the President asking the Congress not to go too much into detail about the background of 9-11.
[00:38:38.674 --> 00:38:39.714]  What does this mean?
[00:38:40.374 --> 00:38:47.399]  And then, until now, what the President knew before 9-11 is a total secret.
[00:38:48.659 --> 00:39:00.307]  I think there is no secret service around the world which gave not hints to the American secret service community, the CIA, the DIA, and so on and so on.
[00:39:00.567 --> 00:39:01.828]  They did nothing out of it.
[00:39:02.432 --> 00:39:13.475]  And the most disturbing thing is that these guys, which knew about something about coming up 9-11, they were cut out before.
[00:39:14.835 --> 00:39:24.618]  I mean, the local level, the regional level of the FBI offices, they knew quite a lot, and they tried to force the central...
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:44.590]  The central organization to go into the details about Arabs taking lessons in flight schools and so on, and the guy who decided on top, I think it's the second man within the FBI, he told, no, we don't do this, and he got promoted after 9-11.
[00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:47.231]  By the way, the U.S.
[00:39:47.371 --> 00:39:49.973]  embassies that allowed supposed al-Qaeda back in...
[00:39:50.749 --> 00:39:52.790]  Got record cash bonuses.
[00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:59.212]  The FBI agents that ordered other FBI agents not to stop Al Qaeda, they got bonuses.
[00:39:59.572 --> 00:40:06.495]  Bush signed W199I months before 9-11, ordering the FBI not to stop Al Qaeda.
[00:40:06.915 --> 00:40:11.477]  They threatened to arrest FBI agent Robert Wright if he tells us what he knows.
[00:40:11.497 --> 00:40:15.318]  I've interviewed his lawyer, David Shippers, who knew about the attacks beforehand.
[00:40:15.398 --> 00:40:16.218]  He went to Bush.
[00:40:16.558 --> 00:40:17.579]  Bush wouldn't talk to him.
[00:40:17.679 --> 00:40:18.139]  Ashcroft
[00:40:18.679 --> 00:40:19.540]  We're good to go.
[00:40:48.891 --> 00:40:50.552]  Yeah, that's absolutely correct.
[00:40:51.313 --> 00:40:58.718]  And then the wars, which were reasoned to be as fights against terrorism.
[00:40:59.399 --> 00:41:12.789]  The war against Afghanistan to put out the Taliban, it was decided long before, and I think in June before 9-11, the Pakistan government and the Indian government was...
[00:41:18.977 --> 00:41:24.318]  And also, 44,000 U.S.
[00:41:24.778 --> 00:41:26.439]  troops, 18,000 U.S.
[00:41:26.459 --> 00:41:28.979]  troops were in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.
[00:41:29.259 --> 00:41:33.400]  Bush had the battle launch orders on his desk two days before 9-11.
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:40.482]  And I want to digress, sir, back to torture for a minute, because you have impressed me.
[00:41:40.502 --> 00:41:42.582]  I mean, you know so much about this.
[00:41:42.642 --> 00:41:43.962]  You've researched it so well.
[00:41:44.342 --> 00:41:47.223]  On the torture issue, General Rick Baucus...
[00:41:47.964 --> 00:41:53.430]  Quit Guantanamo because he, quote, refused to torture the people there.
[00:41:53.891 --> 00:42:02.501]  And the CIA section chief bragged in the Washington Post that they fly them to foreign countries and the CIA tortures them themselves.
[00:42:02.761 --> 00:42:04.243]  So they do admit the torture.
[00:42:07.907 --> 00:42:08.707]  Sure.
[00:42:09.567 --> 00:42:11.468]  I can comment on this.
[00:42:11.768 --> 00:42:13.548]  It's obvious.
[00:42:13.848 --> 00:42:32.292]  And all the court proceedings against, for example, Masai, I think it was the 20th, normally supposed in each aircraft five hijackers,
[00:42:32.919 --> 00:42:46.238]  And one was taken into prison by the FBI before, and then the process was made, I think, in Alexandria, in Virginia, and the judge said, well, if you don't give the proof by these guys who run...
[00:42:49.862 --> 00:42:51.383]  Yes, we're good to go.
[00:42:51.723 --> 00:42:51.983]  I think?
[00:43:10.582 --> 00:43:20.411]  The nomination of very loose elements of Islam people.
[00:43:22.853 --> 00:43:31.560]  In Hamburg, the trials are failing because the American government is not delivering the proof.
[00:43:33.673 --> 00:43:34.434]  Absolutely.
[00:43:34.614 --> 00:43:38.458]  And look, we've had military officers, many others on.
[00:43:38.538 --> 00:43:47.626]  It's clear Al-Qaeda is a CIA creation, a foggy boogeyman, so the military-industrial complex can carry out attacks and then pin it on them.
[00:43:48.207 --> 00:43:54.793]  And we know, I mean, when bin Laden blows up a building, supposedly, our government pays their family to rebuild it.
[00:43:54.813 --> 00:43:58.717]  I mean, there's the payoff right out in the open.
[00:44:02.322 --> 00:44:17.469]  The whole background, the whole personal, like Bin Laden, like Al-Qaeda, like Taliban, even Saddam Hussein, these are all figures which were handled by CIA in former times.
[00:44:18.149 --> 00:44:22.811]  So probably they are recycled in the system now as bad guys.
[00:44:22.911 --> 00:44:25.873]  Before they were the good guys.
[00:44:27.169 --> 00:44:33.752]  I'm taking away the Russians out of Afghanistan and dealing with this and getting money for that, paid for this.
[00:44:34.553 --> 00:44:38.374]  And now they are used as bad guys.
[00:44:38.494 --> 00:44:42.796]  And Osama bin Laden has been, I think, in 95...
[00:44:46.583 --> 00:44:55.172]  In the Balkans, in an operation where the Americans were with the UKG in Albania.
[00:44:56.193 --> 00:44:58.034]  You find these guys all over.
[00:44:58.074 --> 00:45:03.179]  You find them in Chechnya, for example.
[00:45:05.201 --> 00:45:09.886]  And these are also former Afghanis, as they are called.
[00:45:10.436 --> 00:45:17.030]  And they are driving the global play of Secret Services, of CIA, for example.
[00:45:18.229 --> 00:45:24.250]  Absolutely, and then they provide the crisis, so the big brother can provide the police state solution.
[00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:46.035]  Andres Von Bulow, it's clear that if we do not expose who at least stands to gain from the terror and who is involved in it, that is the large financial interests that own our government, they're going to be able to use America as the engine for, quote, imperial mobilization and world domination, as Brzezinski and the PNAC documents and others have said.
[00:45:46.495 --> 00:45:47.675]  How important is it
[00:45:49.416 --> 00:45:57.542]  I think it's for everybody outside of the United States.
[00:45:57.642 --> 00:46:13.073]  It's extremely important because it's a question of whether democracy will survive and the state of law is kept up or we are driven by public relation and financial interests.
[00:46:13.653 --> 00:46:15.955]  And the main thing I think for the Americans is
[00:46:16.942 --> 00:46:18.265]  Who pays for all this?
[00:46:18.846 --> 00:46:26.222]  Because if the oil companies get more cheap oil and make their money out of it...
[00:46:28.088 --> 00:46:31.331]  The American taxpayer has to pay for the military machine.
[00:46:31.531 --> 00:46:33.753]  Not the oil companies are paying for that.
[00:46:33.813 --> 00:46:39.179]  Also, we're paying... Not the military industrial complexes paying for it.
[00:46:39.279 --> 00:46:40.740]  It's the American taxpayer.
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:42.682]  So it's extremely important.
[00:46:43.182 --> 00:46:43.763]  Absolutely.
[00:46:43.823 --> 00:46:48.608]  And now we are paying record amounts for fuel, for petrol.
[00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:57.185]  Mr. Vombulo, in this country while they have record supplies and the oil companies are posting record profits.
[00:46:58.147 --> 00:46:59.751]  I want to get into WTC7.
[00:47:01.115 --> 00:47:02.535]  Because I want people to hear these clips.
[00:47:02.875 --> 00:47:13.317]  This is from the PBS documentary, and this will just take a minute, sir, and we'll get your comment on it, where they describe how Building 7 fell, how they removed it first after it fell because, quote, nobody died in it.
[00:47:13.677 --> 00:47:22.139]  And then it's the owner, Larry Silverstein, saying that they pulled it, gave the order to demolish it on the afternoon of September 11th.
[00:47:22.699 --> 00:47:24.879]  So, Mark, go ahead and hit that clip for us, please.
[00:47:26.279 --> 00:47:30.360]  Trade Center 7 had always been considered the starting point for rebuilding.
[00:47:32.268 --> 00:47:40.131]  Located north of the slurry wall, seven had been cleared faster than the rest of the site, and there had been no bodies to recover.
[00:47:44.212 --> 00:47:52.675]  Pelted by debris when the north tower collapsed, seven burned until late afternoon, allowing occupants to evacuate to safety.
[00:47:53.936 --> 00:48:00.138]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander, telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[00:48:01.835 --> 00:48:03.836]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[00:48:04.896 --> 00:48:06.777]  And this last thing goes as part.
[00:48:07.637 --> 00:48:09.718]  And they made that decision to pull.
[00:48:10.438 --> 00:48:14.240]  And we watched the building collapse.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:17.441]  We made the decision to pull and then watched the building collapse.
[00:48:17.481 --> 00:48:21.842]  Now here's Dan Rather, seconds after it collapses, replaying the collapse of 7.
[00:48:21.982 --> 00:48:24.523]  And this is what Dan Rather had to say.
[00:48:24.543 --> 00:48:25.944]  Then we'll get Von Biele's comment.
[00:48:26.124 --> 00:48:26.744]  Go ahead and hit it.
[00:48:26.964 --> 00:48:28.785]  What you're seeing are high shots, Steve.
[00:48:30.493 --> 00:48:33.614]  Now, here we're going to show you a videotape of the collapse itself.
[00:48:34.455 --> 00:48:38.016]  Now we go to videotape the collapse of this building.
[00:48:38.696 --> 00:48:39.837]  It's amazing.
[00:48:41.137 --> 00:48:43.218]  Amazing, incredible, pick your word.
[00:48:44.158 --> 00:48:54.982]  For the third time today, it's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[00:48:56.083 --> 00:48:56.283]  Now,
[00:48:57.407 --> 00:49:00.110]  Again, the seismographs show multiple explosions.
[00:49:00.571 --> 00:49:02.313]  The firefighters were told to get back.
[00:49:03.153 --> 00:49:06.357]  Von Bielow, how important is this piece of evidence?
[00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:10.141]  The explosions?
[00:49:10.822 --> 00:49:16.128]  Well, sure, it's, you know, the government has to explain it.
[00:49:17.914 --> 00:49:20.237]  They have to prove their case.
[00:49:20.297 --> 00:49:27.405]  They have to prove their conspiracy theory about these 19 Muslims under the direction of Osama Bin Laden.
[00:49:27.465 --> 00:49:28.887]  That's not my business.
[00:49:29.708 --> 00:49:34.814]  My question is only, if there are explosions, is this true?
[00:49:37.148 --> 00:49:48.057]  Can it be that the heat out of kerosene is able to destroy these huge buildings in a manner that they are collapsing in the...
[00:49:52.327 --> 00:49:53.588]  Symmetrical.
[00:49:54.168 --> 00:50:00.109]  In a very short, in a few seconds, they broke together.
[00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:02.150]  It's nearly impossible.
[00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:13.113]  And so everything which is on the table is telling that the government story is not true.
[00:50:13.672 --> 00:50:14.973]  And that must be another story.
[00:50:15.013 --> 00:50:16.914]  There must have been explosions.
[00:50:17.334 --> 00:50:33.102]  And if there are spikes on the geological institutions in five states, 2.2 on the Richter Scala, then you have to find out what's the background.
[00:50:33.222 --> 00:50:37.584]  And five or seven days later, the temperature on the...
[00:50:38.095 --> 00:50:38.936]  We've got a break.
[00:50:39.016 --> 00:50:39.876]  We've got a break.
[00:50:39.896 --> 00:50:40.617]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:10.006]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:51:10.227 --> 00:51:21.495]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:51:21.715 --> 00:51:24.337]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:51:24.697 --> 00:51:31.160]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled, and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:33.181]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:51:33.381 --> 00:51:39.403]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[00:51:39.664 --> 00:51:45.326]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:51:45.646 --> 00:51:49.590]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:51:50.331 --> 00:51:51.132]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:51:51.192 --> 00:51:54.195]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:07.000]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:12.942]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:52:13.222 --> 00:52:18.483]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:52:18.763 --> 00:52:22.924]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:52:23.104 --> 00:52:26.865]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:52:27.145 --> 00:52:31.706]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:52:31.846 --> 00:52:38.107]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:52:38.147 --> 00:52:40.008]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:52:40.468 --> 00:52:42.548]  Order 911 The Road to Tyranny today.

[00:52:54.291 --> 00:52:56.271]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[00:52:56.511 --> 00:52:58.011]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:52:58.192 --> 00:53:00.292]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:53:00.934 --> 00:53:03.396]  You hear a lot about the quality of air outside these days.
[00:53:03.516 --> 00:53:03.997]  Pollution.
[00:53:04.037 --> 00:53:04.297]  Hauling.
[00:53:04.357 --> 00:53:05.458]  Is it as healthy as you'd like it?
[00:53:05.518 --> 00:53:05.938]  Allergies.
[00:53:06.058 --> 00:53:06.359]  Asthma.
[00:53:06.399 --> 00:53:06.919]  Probably not.
[00:53:07.099 --> 00:53:07.840]  Well, listen to this.
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:17.048]  Did you know, according to the American Lung Association, combined with the EPA, the air quality inside your home is actually six to ten times worse than the air outside?
[00:53:17.128 --> 00:53:17.928]  Six to ten times?
[00:53:17.968 --> 00:53:18.509]  How could that be?
[00:53:25.774 --> 00:53:27.376]  Where do you think all those fumes go?
[00:53:28.157 --> 00:53:29.199]  Well, I'll tell you where they go.
[00:53:29.239 --> 00:53:30.801]  They go into you, into your children.
[00:53:34.384 --> 00:53:35.265]  Remember this word.
[00:53:35.665 --> 00:53:36.405]  Puritech.
[00:53:36.445 --> 00:53:37.986]  P-U-R-I-T-E-C.
[00:53:38.026 --> 00:53:40.227]  Puritech makes the Pure Air System.
[00:53:40.387 --> 00:53:52.935]  What this air cleaning system does is remove dangerous airborne particles like smoke, odors, VOCs, allergens, fine dust, mold, pollen, and kills bacteria for less than half the cost of other air purifiers, which do a lot less.
[00:53:53.035 --> 00:53:54.315]  Call them now to breathe easier.
[00:53:54.335 --> 00:53:54.375]  888-491-4100.
[00:53:54.395 --> 00:53:55.456]  The Puritech Pure Air System.
[00:53:55.556 --> 00:53:56.276]  Online at Puritech.com.
[00:54:11.245 --> 00:54:16.847]  We're talking to Andres Von Bulow, a minister at the highest levels of the German government.
[00:54:17.267 --> 00:54:19.148]  His last post as the head of technology.
[00:54:21.028 --> 00:54:22.108]  And I know we've got a lot of callers.
[00:54:22.148 --> 00:54:24.609]  We only have time to take one or two from Dan in Oklahoma.
[00:54:25.709 --> 00:54:31.731]  I just want to commend Andres Von Bulow for writing his book, 9-11 and the CIA.
[00:54:32.912 --> 00:54:34.672]  And I would hope that a publisher in the U.S.
[00:54:34.692 --> 00:54:37.653]  would get it translated and published here because I would definitely carry it.
[00:54:38.376 --> 00:54:46.101]  You can find information on the book for those that read and speak German at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:54:47.162 --> 00:54:49.524]  Andres Rombulo, let's take a call.
[00:54:49.564 --> 00:54:51.445]  Let's talk to Dan in Oklahoma.
[00:54:51.745 --> 00:54:52.666]  Dan, you're on the air.
[00:54:52.706 --> 00:54:53.146]  Go ahead.
[00:54:53.546 --> 00:54:54.487]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:54:54.767 --> 00:55:00.951]  Mr. Rombulo, my question is, following this disaster of 9-1-1,
[00:55:03.081 --> 00:55:08.885]  I understand Germany, France, and Russia, why they didn't want to get involved because of the money that they had invested in Iraq.
[00:55:09.865 --> 00:55:18.771]  With the military-industrial complex like it is, what do you understand the New World Order to be, especially since they said they could use this event of 9-1-1?
[00:55:18.931 --> 00:55:22.934]  Who are the forces behind government-sponsored terror?
[00:55:25.436 --> 00:55:27.457]  Who are the forces behind government...
[00:55:28.419 --> 00:55:29.280]  I didn't understand this.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:32.062]  Well, we know there's this global government now forming.
[00:55:32.083 --> 00:55:35.326]  We know powerful financial interests are engineering terror attacks.
[00:55:35.606 --> 00:55:38.889]  Who are the forces behind the military-industrial complex?
[00:55:38.909 --> 00:55:45.835]  Well, there's always an interest if you look at the...
[00:55:46.974 --> 00:56:02.821]  A munition factory, as I observed in the East-West conflict or in the Near East conflict, they are always trying to sell the material to both sides, and they are always interested in conflicts, and they would like
[00:56:03.759 --> 00:56:17.848]  After the breakdown of the Soviet Union, the normal thing would be that we cut down this military-industrial complex, which costs the American taxpayer a huge amount of money.
[00:56:18.228 --> 00:56:23.391]  And exactly at the same time, when the Soviet Union is breaking down, this new terror thing comes up.
[00:56:23.871 --> 00:56:26.833]  And the first terrorist attacks were...
[00:56:27.633 --> 00:56:37.681]  I think the World Trade Center won, where you found out that the leading guy of this pump building, this was at this time an agricultural pump,
[00:56:38.694 --> 00:56:44.276]  He was immediately going to the FBI and telling them, I tell you everything about this.
[00:56:44.956 --> 00:57:01.720]  And they agreed about that finally 24 hours before the attack in 1993, they would change the dangerous powder against the undangerous powder.
[00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:04.021]  And the FBI didn't come up.
[00:57:04.770 --> 00:57:15.734]  Yeah, they cooked the bomb and trained the drivers, and that's another... A thousand people were inflicted, and six people were dead.
[00:57:16.214 --> 00:57:18.295]  In Oklahoma, you had nearly the same thing.
[00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:20.361]  You had two attacks.
[00:57:20.621 --> 00:57:38.114]  One was of perhaps McNay and this other guy, but there was another attack much more stronger than this agricultural bomb, and there is an American general and an Air Force general who had it for, I think, 10 years or 15 years.
[00:57:40.091 --> 00:57:48.136]  Explosive Institute and he said never could this agrarian bomb bring about such a damage.
[00:57:48.677 --> 00:57:53.440]  There must be something else and they found that within the building there were
[00:57:53.965 --> 00:57:55.646]  Demolition charges.
[00:57:55.946 --> 00:57:56.646]  Absolutely.
[00:57:57.146 --> 00:57:58.107]  Dan, thanks for the call.
[00:57:59.227 --> 00:58:01.208]  I hope we can get you on in the future again.
[00:58:01.308 --> 00:58:03.229]  Andres Romulo, you've been so kind.
[00:58:03.669 --> 00:58:10.573]  You have such amazing courage to stand up and tell the truth, and we've been honored to have you on the show from Germany.
[00:58:10.613 --> 00:58:11.253]  God bless you.
[00:58:12.933 --> 00:58:13.754]  All right, folks.
[00:58:14.134 --> 00:58:14.894]  We're live.
[00:58:15.074 --> 00:58:17.535]  It is Friday, the 6th of February, 2004.
[00:58:17.616 --> 00:58:23.679]  We've got more guests, all the latest news coming up in the second and third hours.
[00:58:24.279 --> 00:58:25.179]  So stay with us.
[00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:28.481]  Believe me, this is vital info coming up.
[00:58:28.541 --> 00:58:32.663]  We had a lot of requests to re-air the Von Bilo interview, so there it is.
[00:58:32.723 --> 00:58:37.446]  It's also posted at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:58:37.486 --> 00:58:39.447]  We need to get a transcript made of that.
[00:58:39.927 --> 00:58:44.232]  So again, coming up, second and third hours, please stay with us.
[00:58:44.292 --> 00:58:48.437]  It's going to be info-packed here in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:58:48.637 --> 00:58:49.418]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:49.458 --> 00:58:49.919]  Stay with us.
[00:58:51.354 --> 00:58:52.955]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:53.335 --> 00:58:59.078]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:58:59.318 --> 00:59:04.461]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:59:04.801 --> 00:59:14.066]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:59:14.426 --> 00:59:19.409]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:59:19.709 --> 00:59:23.731]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:59:23.911 --> 00:59:28.674]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:59:29.054 --> 00:59:34.937]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:59:35.297 --> 00:59:44.321]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:59:44.521 --> 00:59:45.461]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:59:45.481 --> 00:59:46.602]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:59:57.664 --> 00:59:58.304]  Big Brother.
[00:59:58.965 --> 01:00:00.065]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:00.725 --> 01:00:01.866]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.506 --> 01:00:03.306]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:04.987]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.627 --> 01:00:09.449]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.809 --> 01:00:13.930]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.051 --> 01:00:18.172]  All right, my friends, we're live.
[01:00:19.092 --> 01:00:21.893]  It is Friday, the 6th day of February, 2004.
[01:00:25.114 --> 01:00:35.984]  Coming up in about 30 minutes, we're going to have Sherman Skolnick, who's broken a lot of major stories over the last 40 years as an exposer of the globalist, with Lenny Bloom.
[01:00:36.004 --> 01:00:39.347]  And Lenny Bloom, of course, for over a year had a show.
[01:00:40.074 --> 01:00:58.164]  Well, cloak and dagger on a big station out of Toronto, Canada, and they had the former German Defense Minister, Minister of Technology, on their last show, the show I was on, and they got canned despite the fact, and we've seen the numbers,
[01:00:58.544 --> 01:01:04.928]  They have the number one rated talk show in the city, beating out even bigger stations, only after a year on the air.
[01:01:04.968 --> 01:01:11.091]  We're going to go over some of this and get into what the New World Order is up to here in about 30 minutes.
[01:01:11.211 --> 01:01:27.340]  In the meantime, I'm going to blitz through news and information and, of course, jam some calls in if you want to comment on the interview we just re-aired with Andres Von Bulow, the toll-free number to join us on air.
[01:01:28.169 --> 01:01:29.509]  Is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:29.529 --> 01:01:30.390]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:43.713]  And again, we have the Vombilo interview posted at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[01:01:44.473 --> 01:01:53.495]  I hope you'll email that address out to everybody and help spread the information, because here's a high-level government official saying the globalists are clearly behind 9-11.
[01:01:53.535 --> 01:01:54.435]  All right.
[01:01:55.396 --> 01:01:56.916]  Here's some of the news that's coming up.
[01:01:57.685 --> 01:01:58.866]  Jobless rate drops 112,000.
[01:01:58.906 --> 01:02:00.286]  Again, jobless rate drops 112,000 jobs added.
[01:02:00.306 --> 01:02:02.167]  Now, last Monday...
[01:02:09.426 --> 01:02:24.979]  The Washington Post reported the official federal numbers that 2 million people are now, in the next three weeks, and that was a few weeks ago, so now that's happened, are going to go off the unemployment rolls, and then they're not counted as unemployed.
[01:02:25.019 --> 01:02:29.522]  So you've got millions of people going off the unemployment rolls, and the new numbers come out.
[01:02:29.602 --> 01:02:29.943]  Why?
[01:02:29.963 --> 01:02:30.923]  We've added 112,000 jobs.
[01:02:30.943 --> 01:02:31.784]  It's total smoke and mirrors.
[01:02:36.337 --> 01:02:37.098]  Here's an example.
[01:02:37.178 --> 01:02:44.404]  Three years ago during the booming economy, four years ago, from six in the morning till eight at night, traffic all over Austin.
[01:02:44.424 --> 01:02:45.945]  It would take hours to go anywhere.
[01:02:46.726 --> 01:02:51.990]  Now, at 5.30, I can get anywhere in the city in about 45 minutes instead of an hour and a half, two hours.
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:58.602]  There are houses for sale everywhere, people going bankrupt, record foreclosures.
[01:02:59.042 --> 01:03:00.763]  That's the real economic numbers.
[01:03:01.303 --> 01:03:10.767]  From Austin, you know, a city of a million people, the fastest growing, richest city, according to Money Magazine and Forbes, what, five years running.
[01:03:11.547 --> 01:03:15.589]  So here we are in Austin, this milk and honey place, and that's the real numbers.
[01:03:15.609 --> 01:03:16.469]  So we'll go over that.
[01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:20.451]  Rail station suicide bomb, blast kills 40 in Russia.
[01:03:21.098 --> 01:03:21.879]  Don't try to spin it, please.
[01:03:21.919 --> 01:03:22.499]  Please, don't try it.
[01:03:48.932 --> 01:03:51.494]  Also, McCain picked for Iraq intelligence probe.
[01:03:51.714 --> 01:03:53.395]  He'll be whitewashing that.
[01:03:53.435 --> 01:03:54.796]  McCain, total New World Order.
[01:03:55.677 --> 01:03:58.759]  Howard calls for Blair to resign over all of his lying.
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:02.482]  Also, Utah fears Matrix shared personal data.
[01:04:02.782 --> 01:04:13.089]  I already told you, Matrix, in exchange for credit card companies, everybody else spying on you, they give the information others have gathered, the government does, back to the private companies.
[01:04:13.569 --> 01:04:16.051]  And this is out of the mainstream news there.
[01:04:17.143 --> 01:04:24.852]  In the great state of Utah, Army officials up in arms over Federation of American Scientists' website.
[01:04:26.374 --> 01:04:35.924]  For years, the Federation of American Scientists publishes declassified Army documents of their plans to microchip us, concentration camps, foreign troops.
[01:04:35.964 --> 01:04:37.086]  That's where we get a lot of our info.
[01:04:37.831 --> 01:04:44.721]  Turns out the Army was threatening their website and other sites, and now the Army's having to apologize and go, okay, this was declassified.
[01:04:45.462 --> 01:04:46.384]  Very interesting.
[01:04:46.684 --> 01:04:47.946]  GOP slams Bush.
[01:04:48.367 --> 01:04:49.849]  We'll be right back with all this and more.
[01:04:53.519 --> 01:05:04.249]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:12.037]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:12.277 --> 01:05:15.400]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:15.940]  We're good to go.
[01:05:34.235 --> 01:05:40.159]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:44.343]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:44.363 --> 01:05:44.943]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:05:54.318 --> 01:05:56.919]  Brr, record cold spells dripping the nation this winter.
[01:05:57.039 --> 01:05:58.139]  So much for global warming.
[01:05:58.339 --> 01:06:02.500]  Of course, hand in hand with record cold spells usually go record fuel bills for heating.
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:05.500]  But for thousands of people across the country, there's no record fuel bill.
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:06.941]  In fact, there's no bill at all.
[01:06:07.101 --> 01:06:13.582]  These people have discovered the magic of a warm workshop without the cost by burning waste oil with a waste oil heater kit from Harold Electric.
[01:06:13.782 --> 01:06:16.403]  We all enjoy having a comfortable shop in the winter months to work in.
[01:06:16.623 --> 01:06:23.364]  And a waste oil heater from Harold Electric can turn your waste oil from a liability into an incredibly efficient and economical way to heat your workshop.
[01:06:23.564 --> 01:06:24.164]  We're good to go.
[01:06:24.204 --> 01:06:24.784]  We're good to go.
[01:06:24.804 --> 01:06:25.485]  We're good to go.
[01:06:53.112 --> 01:06:57.457]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:06:57.657 --> 01:07:02.083]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:07:02.223 --> 01:07:06.608]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:07:06.728 --> 01:07:07.969]  A New World Order.
[01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:09.491]  Can emerge.
[01:07:09.771 --> 01:07:13.996]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:07:14.056 --> 01:07:20.983]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:07:21.123 --> 01:07:23.125]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:07:23.626 --> 01:07:28.070]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:07:28.090 --> 01:07:30.232]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:07:30.272 --> 01:07:30.992]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:07:31.012 --> 01:07:31.352]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:07:31.413 --> 01:07:32.273]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:07:53.081 --> 01:07:58.107]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:58.487 --> 01:08:00.830]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:07.837 --> 01:08:08.778]  Hello, my friends.
[01:08:09.098 --> 01:08:10.220]  It is Friday.
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:12.682]  I'm going to launch straight into the news.
[01:08:12.702 --> 01:08:14.404]  We've got guests coming up here in about 25 minutes.
[01:08:17.609 --> 01:08:20.492]  Again, the jobless rate, they're saying, has dropped.
[01:08:20.532 --> 01:08:28.020]  They say there's been 112,000 jobs added, but remember, millions of people just went off the unemployment rolls, so those numbers are cooked.
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.002]  I mean, I wish those were real numbers, but...
[01:08:30.976 --> 01:08:36.479]  It's like the Ministry of Plenty in 1984, always telling you how much better stuff's getting, and it's not true.
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:38.100]  NAFTA and GATT are bad.
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.181]  They're destroying this country.
[01:08:39.661 --> 01:08:42.683]  Rail station suicide bomb blast kills 40.
[01:08:43.123 --> 01:08:44.304]  About 40 people died.
[01:08:44.344 --> 01:08:55.531]  At least 100 were injured when an explosion tore apart a carriage in the Moscow subway during morning rush hour yesterday, with police saying it was probably a suicide bombing.
[01:08:56.209 --> 01:09:07.379]  Eyewitnesses, some of them, covered with blood, smoke, and carnage when the blast hit a subway carriage between two stations in the southeast Moscow at around 8.40 a.m.
[01:09:07.539 --> 01:09:16.868]  Interfax News Agency put the number of dead at around 40, with the toll expected to rise in emergency officials that at least 100 people could have been inside each subway carriage at the time.
[01:09:18.115 --> 01:09:20.456]  Now, Vladimir Putin was caught when he was vice president.
[01:09:20.496 --> 01:09:23.997]  He's a former KGB chief from Stalingrad, Leningrad.
[01:09:24.437 --> 01:09:26.738]  Give it whatever name you want, they're always changing it.
[01:09:27.078 --> 01:09:27.458]  Now St.
[01:09:27.478 --> 01:09:28.078]  Petersburg.
[01:09:29.058 --> 01:09:32.700]  He was a nice KGB mid-level chief, and they put the puppet in.
[01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:39.602]  And old Vladimir Putin was caught with his FSB planting the bombs in a fourth building.
[01:09:39.622 --> 01:09:40.602]  And that's all public.
[01:09:40.762 --> 01:09:41.722]  FSB's gone public.
[01:09:41.742 --> 01:09:43.863]  The Moscow police caught his men doing it.
[01:09:44.163 --> 01:09:46.524]  And many of the other bombings we know are their people.
[01:09:47.365 --> 01:09:50.881]  And so they just continue to do this over and over again.
[01:09:53.436 --> 01:09:54.317]  We're good to go.
[01:10:18.937 --> 01:10:21.840]  Bush to defend record on television.
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:30.408]  Talk shows have garnered key role in presidential politics, and Bush is to be on for the full hour of Meet the Press this Sunday.
[01:10:31.709 --> 01:10:34.111]  By the way, I have another Associated Press article here.
[01:10:34.192 --> 01:10:39.797]  The White House is doing multiple-staged Meet the Press meetings
[01:10:41.664 --> 01:10:43.265]  I guess you could call it theatrical.
[01:10:43.325 --> 01:10:48.229]  What do they call it when the troupe of actors gets together and does their rehearsals?
[01:10:48.289 --> 01:10:50.891]  Yes, they're doing their rehearsals for it.
[01:10:51.351 --> 01:11:02.360]  And Bush will go on the Tim Russert CFR program and be thrown softballs and tell us how he never said there were weapons of mass destruction and Saddam's real evil and give your rights up and we'll keep you safe.
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:11.043]  President Bush suggested to his staff that he appear on Meet the Press on Sunday as a way of answering questions about Iraq after a barrage of Democratic criticism against him.
[01:11:11.463 --> 01:11:15.885]  You see, it's always Democratic criticism, so conservatives go, oh, it must be garbage.
[01:11:16.425 --> 01:11:25.549]  A White House official said yesterday Bush's decision to submit to an hour-long interrogation by NBC's Tim Russert comes as Democrat John F. Kennedy.
[01:11:25.929 --> 01:11:39.897]  Terry, Howard Dean, John Edwards, and Wesley Clark have been denouncing him, not just on Sunday morning shows, but on programs ranging from Hardball and Larry King Live, the David Letterman's Light Show, and John Stewart's The Daily Show, where Edwards announced his candidacy.
[01:11:41.494 --> 01:11:54.059]  The president has stepped up his television presence over the last year or so, granting interviews to ABC's Diane Sawyer, Barbara Walters, NBC's Tom Brokaw, CNBC's Ron Insana.
[01:11:54.339 --> 01:12:05.163]  But the time when he was dipped in the polls and is on the defensive over the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, meet the press and its audience of 5 million represents a roll of a dice.
[01:12:07.153 --> 01:12:09.935]  Well, Bush, I mean, you can just put out some more fake terror alerts.
[01:12:09.955 --> 01:12:11.076]  That seemed to work in the past.
[01:12:11.096 --> 01:12:17.861]  I mean, the FBI and CIA have admitted that they were ordered to, quote, issue fake terror alerts to, quote, create hysteria.
[01:12:18.281 --> 01:12:23.084]  We have a huge fake terror alert section at prisonplanet.com.
[01:12:23.104 --> 01:12:25.566]  That's a big deal, because if you or I do that, we're in deep trouble.
[01:12:26.887 --> 01:12:28.228]  And you are seeing Dick Cheney.
[01:12:28.268 --> 01:12:29.389]  You are seeing Tenet.
[01:12:29.429 --> 01:12:32.291]  You are seeing Powell and others.
[01:12:33.747 --> 01:12:38.069]  Running around all over the place now because they're in a lot of trouble.
[01:12:38.249 --> 01:12:39.790]  But again, they're just front puppets.
[01:12:40.931 --> 01:12:46.093]  If the globalists decide to burn them politically, they'll just move their other Skull and Bones member, John Kerry, in there.
[01:12:46.374 --> 01:12:48.114]  And I didn't spend enough time on this yesterday.
[01:12:48.135 --> 01:12:49.555]  I spent about a minute on this yesterday.
[01:12:49.575 --> 01:13:02.582]  The Houston Chronicle, and this is posted on the websites in yesterday's sections, Houston Chronicle reported that Anthony Scalia, one of the Supreme Court justices, he's not a conservative, by the way, he's a phony conservative,
[01:13:03.676 --> 01:13:07.598]  Has committed a crime, and it is admittedly a violation of federal and state laws.
[01:13:08.338 --> 01:13:19.002]  He is the sitting judge in the court case that's coming up the next two weeks before the Supreme Court, considering Dick Cheney and his Energy Commission blocking documents.
[01:13:20.103 --> 01:13:25.745]  You're not supposed to have a judge vacationing multiple times, publicly.
[01:13:25.805 --> 01:13:26.865]  They don't even try to hide it.
[01:13:27.186 --> 01:13:33.148]  Getting on Air Force Two, having it all paid for, guns supplied, everything, to go duck hunting.
[01:13:33.942 --> 01:13:36.524]  Just flying around on Air Force Two, duck hunting.
[01:13:37.364 --> 01:13:44.008]  Now understand, this is petty corruption compared to the $1.2 trillion missing from the Pentagon.
[01:13:44.048 --> 01:13:45.049]  Yes, you heard me right.
[01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:49.412]  $1.2 trillion under Clinton, and now under Bush it's accelerated.
[01:13:49.432 --> 01:13:52.073]  It was only what?
[01:13:52.093 --> 01:13:56.216]  $750 billion for Clinton's eight years of criminal activity, and then now they've added...
[01:13:58.061 --> 01:14:05.006]  Now they've added almost half that amount on in just the last three years, so things are accelerating quite nicely.
[01:14:05.466 --> 01:14:07.727]  We don't discuss that too much, although we should.
[01:14:07.787 --> 01:14:08.608]  It's no big deal.
[01:14:08.628 --> 01:14:10.549]  There's a few AP articles.
[01:14:10.609 --> 01:14:11.109]  No big deal.
[01:14:11.129 --> 01:14:11.990]  Not a major news item.
[01:14:12.891 --> 01:14:25.679]  But to have them committing this felony, and they've got it in the Houston Chronicle, which is a neocon paper, to have them just openly flaunting it, we don't care if there's a court case coming up before Scalia,
[01:14:26.303 --> 01:14:33.485]  Well, I mean, imagine having a mobster trial and the judge is flying around with Don Corleone duck hunting.
[01:14:35.346 --> 01:14:36.366]  It's unbelievable!
[01:14:36.686 --> 01:14:40.908]  But look, the reason this article is so important is it's right out in the open.
[01:14:40.928 --> 01:14:43.169]  They don't even hide this anymore.
[01:14:45.789 --> 01:14:50.431]  And a lot of people are talking about Condoleezza Rice next week.
[01:14:51.833 --> 01:14:53.395]  First they said Monday, now they're saying Wednesday.
[01:14:53.455 --> 01:14:54.095]  We don't know.
[01:14:54.696 --> 01:15:07.889]  She's going to go to that audio sensor shielded room, that intelligence committee room at the Capitol sometime next week.
[01:15:07.929 --> 01:15:09.070]  Can't even know that now.
[01:15:10.071 --> 01:15:12.493]  Again, the AP said Monday, Washington Post said Wednesday.
[01:15:12.614 --> 01:15:12.974]  I don't know.
[01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:15.331]  But it says she's going to testify.
[01:15:15.831 --> 01:15:19.352]  Old Condoleezza Rice is going to testify about 9-11.
[01:15:19.612 --> 01:15:21.792]  Now, understand, people say, well, why is there this commission?
[01:15:21.832 --> 01:15:22.873]  Why did they ask for more time?
[01:15:23.253 --> 01:15:24.493]  Why is Bush giving them more time?
[01:15:24.873 --> 01:15:30.215]  You know, why have two of the members had to secretly testify, according to the Washington Post, because they were, quote, involved somehow in 9-11?
[01:15:32.415 --> 01:15:37.357]  The Democrat on the committee got given the import-export bank job by Bush when he left the committee.
[01:15:37.377 --> 01:15:38.637]  I mean, a public payoff.
[01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:43.334]  Everybody on the Whitewash Commission is involved.
[01:15:43.354 --> 01:15:48.639]  They told us Henry Kissinger, who they first tried to have be the head of it, after the first Whitewash Commission fell apart.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:53.845]  People didn't buy that, so they've just got other less-known globalists, but I've looked at all their bios.
[01:15:53.885 --> 01:16:00.713]  I mean, it's all CFR, Trilateral Commission, World Government, Bank Chairman, former governors, scammers involved in all this.
[01:16:02.378 --> 01:16:03.919]  We're going to get to the bottom of this for you.
[01:16:25.738 --> 01:16:26.699]  And that's what it's all about.
[01:16:26.779 --> 01:16:32.703]  Now, when Condi goes to it, it's so they can take her testimony under national security, then classify it.
[01:16:33.364 --> 01:16:47.513]  And so she's there to bring it into that envelope, into that shroud, and they're reportedly going to ask her, because it's been confirmed that she's the one that called her longtime buddy, Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco, the night before and said, don't get on a plane to New York.
[01:16:48.194 --> 01:16:52.557]  And that's San Francisco Chronicle Associated Press for you, by the way.
[01:16:54.042 --> 01:16:57.444]  So that's what's going on with the Whitewasher Commission there.
[01:16:57.505 --> 01:17:11.034]  But don't worry, on the Iraq Commission they're forming, McCain picked for Iraq Intelligence Probe, Whitewasher-in-Chief that the media has played up as the man we can all trust and so good and such a hero and total lies as usual.
[01:17:12.296 --> 01:17:14.077]  Howard calls for Blair to resign.
[01:17:14.117 --> 01:17:20.540]  Prime Minister Tony Blair should resign because he failed to ask basic questions on claims made in his Iraq dossier.
[01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:23.842]  Michael Howard said the Tory leader seized on Mr. Blair's admission.
[01:17:24.202 --> 01:17:29.184]  He did not know the claim of Iraq could use weapons within 45 minutes, referred to battlefield arms.
[01:17:31.385 --> 01:17:32.226]  This is how they work.
[01:17:32.406 --> 01:17:39.049]  They can burn politically Blair, and the Tories all voted for it too, instead of talking about the system that lied.
[01:17:40.268 --> 01:17:41.589]  Let's just burn a puppet.
[01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:47.314]  Again, Bush, Blair, Clinton, Gore, they don't run anything, okay?
[01:17:49.296 --> 01:17:53.220]  One of the overlooked things that Paul O'Neill talked about is how the White House wasn't running anything.
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:54.441]  They didn't even have meetings.
[01:17:54.461 --> 01:17:56.222]  It was a group above that running everything.
[01:17:59.045 --> 01:18:01.687]  So let's just get past Bush and Kerry.
[01:18:01.707 --> 01:18:02.388]  They're all puppets.
[01:18:02.408 --> 01:18:05.150]  You can forget the presidential election, my friends.
[01:18:06.471 --> 01:18:07.172]  As we told you...
[01:18:08.107 --> 01:18:15.612]  Months ago, the Matrix system gets every piece of data about you that's out there, public and private, and it's shared back and forth and sold to marketing firms.
[01:18:16.233 --> 01:18:19.255]  Because some of the marketing firms will give data to the government, the government gives it to them.
[01:18:19.675 --> 01:18:23.258]  Desert News out of Utah, Utah fears Matrix shared personal data.
[01:18:23.918 --> 01:18:26.820]  And it comes out they were giving it to American Express and others.
[01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:28.881]  And yes, the Matrix system's real.
[01:18:29.302 --> 01:18:31.203]  Every day I mention the Matrix system, I get an email.
[01:18:32.128 --> 01:18:34.449]  Saying I'm a crazy kook, The Matrix is a movie.
[01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:37.571]  It's a public-federal operation with the states.
[01:18:38.032 --> 01:18:43.115]  It's just the name of the echelon system of the NSA at your local level.
[01:18:43.195 --> 01:18:45.596]  And as soon as you get mad about that, they'll just change the name.
[01:18:46.196 --> 01:18:48.498]  Idiots will declare victory and the programs will go forward.
[01:18:48.898 --> 01:18:51.499]  Same thing with TIPS, WAVE, SAVE.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.541]  Same thing with Total Information Awareness.
[01:18:55.022 --> 01:18:56.743]  DARPA's still there with more funding than ever.
[01:18:58.183 --> 01:18:59.064]  So that's going on.
[01:19:00.129 --> 01:19:04.072]  A really important article we'll get to, and I don't even know if this is posted on the websites.
[01:19:04.132 --> 01:19:04.772]  It should be.
[01:19:06.093 --> 01:19:12.597]  It's at www.fas.org forward slash SGP forward slash news 2004.
[01:19:12.857 --> 01:19:13.918]  I can't read the whole address.
[01:19:13.998 --> 01:19:16.380]  It's just, Watson, please post this, my friend.
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:19.902]  Army officials up in arms over FAS website.
[01:19:20.703 --> 01:19:21.983]  Federation of American Scientists.
[01:19:22.003 --> 01:19:22.684]  This is a big deal.
[01:19:23.917 --> 01:19:32.684]  Because the Federation of American Scientists gets these documents as soon as they're declassified and posts them about how they plan to take your guns, bring in foreign troops, put microchips in you.
[01:19:32.944 --> 01:19:35.106]  I mean, these are official Army documents.
[01:19:35.566 --> 01:19:37.688]  And I've been reading them for eight years on the air.
[01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:44.833]  No matter how crazy this show sounds, I mean, this is how they got the DARPA stuff about how they want to put mine control towers up.
[01:19:44.853 --> 01:19:46.294]  That's where the Boston Globe got it.
[01:19:46.735 --> 01:19:49.297]  The Army was threatening people who were posting these.
[01:19:49.557 --> 01:19:52.059]  Now they're having to apologize because they declassified them.
[01:19:53.095 --> 01:19:54.075]  Is America bankrupt?
[01:19:54.235 --> 01:19:56.796]  Are we on the verge of an all-out economic collapse?
[01:19:57.096 --> 01:19:59.576]  What can be done to protect your family and assets?
[01:19:59.816 --> 01:20:02.877]  What kinds of investments will be able to withstand an economic meltdown?
[01:20:03.017 --> 01:20:05.558]  The problem is it's not always easy to find great solutions.
[01:20:05.698 --> 01:20:09.358]  And during these dangerous economic times, finding the right solution is crucial.
[01:20:09.558 --> 01:20:15.980]  Midas Resources has been a leader in educating people not only about the shaky economic future and its many problems, but also the solutions.
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:21.601]  Now Midas Resources is proud to offer free of charge Peter Kershaw's renowned book, Economic Solutions.

[01:22:52.176 --> 01:22:56.838]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the first ever half-price package sale at the Ark Institute.

[01:23:48.406 --> 01:23:51.287]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[01:23:58.149 --> 01:24:00.069]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:03.350]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:07.232 --> 01:24:11.373]  All right, Tim, Brandon, Ron, Wayne, and others, we're going to get to your calls.
[01:24:12.825 --> 01:24:15.128]  Don't worry, but I need to cover more of this news.
[01:24:16.229 --> 01:24:17.170]  And we've got guests coming on.
[01:24:17.190 --> 01:24:19.293]  We're just going to take calls in that first segment with the guests.
[01:24:20.434 --> 01:24:20.894]  Stay there.
[01:24:22.717 --> 01:24:26.841]  Okay, you know, I come on the air every few months and I read something that sounds totally insane.
[01:24:26.881 --> 01:24:32.448]  The government is going to put up mind control towers that send out waves that will calm you or make you ill or kill you.
[01:24:33.883 --> 01:24:36.904]  And the government says they're going to mount them on top cell towers.
[01:24:36.944 --> 01:24:38.485]  Now, we've already known they've been testing these.
[01:24:38.505 --> 01:24:40.266]  These have been put up around the country already.
[01:24:40.606 --> 01:24:46.068]  They mainly use them in big cities when you're asleep to try to mess up your REM sleep.
[01:24:46.188 --> 01:24:49.669]  This is admitted, by the way, that this stuff's going on.
[01:24:50.310 --> 01:24:53.051]  But now the declassified stuff says they're doing it.
[01:24:53.131 --> 01:24:55.652]  So, you know, again, Boston Globe, stuff like that.
[01:24:55.672 --> 01:24:56.632]  I don't know if you've heard of them.
[01:24:56.692 --> 01:24:58.753]  But where does all this come from?
[01:25:00.123 --> 01:25:07.191]  You see, because this stuff's all 25, 30 years old, the globalists are that far ahead, folks, this stuff gets declassified.
[01:25:08.672 --> 01:25:10.895]  And the Federation of American Scientists post it.
[01:25:11.596 --> 01:25:12.897]  And a lot of times the Army does.
[01:25:12.937 --> 01:25:19.300]  You know, a concentration camp plan, the work camps that were in place in the mid-'70s, declassified in 1997.
[01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:22.902]  That's in my book, Dissent and Eternity.
[01:25:22.922 --> 01:25:24.322]  I've got that document posted.
[01:25:24.342 --> 01:25:25.603]  It's on the Army's website.
[01:25:25.643 --> 01:25:31.306]  It's on the Federation of American Websites, FAS.org.
[01:25:31.886 --> 01:25:38.609]  About two years ago, there was an article in the City Morning Herald called The Hive Mind, and it went further than the 2000 document.
[01:25:40.134 --> 01:25:44.897]  It said that the military's main job will be implanting all citizens with our brain chips.
[01:25:45.438 --> 01:25:46.618]  Now, folks, I didn't say that.
[01:25:46.839 --> 01:25:48.059]  It's the Army official plan.
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:56.005]  And you better watch out, because in 99, the Army War College said they wanted to have a mutual command with Mexico and Canada and bring foreign troops in.
[01:25:56.345 --> 01:25:58.226]  And then now they made that public two years later.
[01:25:58.246 --> 01:25:59.047]  So you better watch out.
[01:25:59.287 --> 01:26:00.648]  They actually carry all this out.
[01:26:00.688 --> 01:26:01.208]  You understand?
[01:26:02.349 --> 01:26:03.490]  This is the declassified stuff.
[01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:04.991]  Can you imagine what's not declassified?
[01:26:06.944 --> 01:26:21.476]  And I saw that Sydney Morning Herald article, and I sat there, and I called the Federation of American Scientists up, who posted the document, and the working group with the CIA, Army, Air Force, Marines, and the Federation of American Scientists.
[01:26:21.516 --> 01:26:26.360]  I said, I'd like to have you on about the Hive Mine document, which the Sydney Morning Herald had a link to.
[01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:29.362]  And the woman goes, how do you know about that?
[01:26:30.543 --> 01:26:31.544]  That's not supposed to be up.
[01:26:32.452 --> 01:26:33.512]  I'm not coming on the show!
[01:26:33.992 --> 01:26:34.733]  And hung the phone up.
[01:26:34.773 --> 01:26:36.553]  I called back and tried to talk to the supervisor.
[01:26:36.593 --> 01:26:37.753]  They go, we're not going to talk to you.
[01:26:38.353 --> 01:26:39.714]  And then it was taken down.
[01:26:40.114 --> 01:26:42.014]  There's so many of these documents.
[01:26:42.034 --> 01:26:43.735]  These fools keep posting them.
[01:26:44.595 --> 01:26:47.716]  Well, the Federation of American Scientists is pretty angry right now.
[01:26:48.316 --> 01:26:57.258]  Army officials... By the way, the Hive Mind article said that we're all... It actually said... It describes the Matrix.
[01:26:57.278 --> 01:26:58.898]  That we're going to be in these cocoons.
[01:26:59.278 --> 01:27:01.039]  Folks, I don't care how nuts this sounds.
[01:27:01.479 --> 01:27:01.779]  Okay?
[01:27:02.651 --> 01:27:03.552]  They said it!
[01:27:03.892 --> 01:27:06.354]  In fact, Watson, will you find that document and repost it?
[01:27:06.394 --> 01:27:10.257]  I know it's... I'm talking to my webmaster for Prison Planet.
[01:27:10.277 --> 01:27:11.698]  I know we've got it posted in the archives.
[01:27:11.738 --> 01:27:13.579]  We'll just find it and stick it up there with this article.
[01:27:13.599 --> 01:27:14.700]  People aren't going to believe this.
[01:27:15.261 --> 01:27:15.941]  I didn't believe it.
[01:27:16.061 --> 01:27:16.742]  I don't believe it.
[01:27:16.782 --> 01:27:17.642]  This is incredible.
[01:27:18.403 --> 01:27:19.944]  That's why it's a nightmare, people.
[01:27:19.964 --> 01:27:21.185]  That's why I'm so freaked out.
[01:27:22.046 --> 01:27:27.209]  And so the new document says they're going to put us in these pods and we're going to be cities of pod people.
[01:27:27.630 --> 01:27:28.891]  Folks, I'm not joking.
[01:27:29.551 --> 01:27:30.332]  Do you understand me?
[01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:32.300]  You understand me.
[01:27:32.821 --> 01:27:33.501]  I'm not kidding.
[01:27:34.601 --> 01:27:41.244]  Well, the Army flipped out and started threatening people, started threatening to arrest people who were posting these.
[01:27:42.325 --> 01:27:44.605]  And we have the emails, the documents, the news articles.
[01:27:44.846 --> 01:27:48.487]  It's all in this Federation of American Scientists website.
[01:27:49.447 --> 01:27:50.728]  The most prestigious group in the country.
[01:27:51.781 --> 01:27:57.506]  And they go, hey, you gave us the documents, we posted them, and the Army's going, people are paying attention to these, they're getting angry.
[01:27:57.826 --> 01:27:58.927]  You ought to go read.
[01:27:59.407 --> 01:28:00.528]  You ought to go read this.
[01:28:01.069 --> 01:28:02.250]  You really ought to go read this.
[01:28:02.850 --> 01:28:04.652]  Because I've been railing about this for years.
[01:28:04.732 --> 01:28:09.216]  I mean, this is where the Boston Globe got their DARPA documents.
[01:28:09.956 --> 01:28:17.643]  We want to put not just brain scanners on the cell towers, but we want to put systems that can control populations and send out the waves.
[01:28:17.723 --> 01:28:17.923]  I mean...
[01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:21.281]  It's not a Twilight Zone episode.
[01:28:21.321 --> 01:28:22.242]  It's not the X-Files.
[01:28:22.642 --> 01:28:24.223]  This is real.
[01:28:25.044 --> 01:28:27.145]  I don't talk about UFOs and stuff I can't prove.
[01:28:27.425 --> 01:28:30.427]  I don't talk about, you know, Yetis and Chupacabras and Bigfoots.
[01:28:30.747 --> 01:28:32.628]  I talk about real stuff.
[01:28:34.089 --> 01:28:35.609]  And this is what they're building.
[01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:37.831]  I mean, I can't believe it, okay?
[01:28:40.012 --> 01:28:43.594]  So, I tell you, maybe in the third hour we'll get into this more.
[01:28:44.631 --> 01:28:45.932]  There is so much more here.
[01:28:46.132 --> 01:28:47.492]  I've never seen such a news day.
[01:28:48.093 --> 01:28:50.954]  GOP slams Bush policies at retreat.
[01:28:51.574 --> 01:29:01.059]  Growing frustration over President Bush's immigration plan and lack of fiscal discipline came to a head behind closed doors at last weekend's Republican retreat in Philadelphia.
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:14.325]  House lawmakers, stunned by the intensity of their constituents' displeasure at some of Mr. Bush's key domestic policies, gave his political strategist Karl Rove an earful behind closed doors
[01:29:15.555 --> 01:29:22.098]  It was intense, but it was not surprised at the tone of the questioning during Roe's session to Representative Tom Finley, Florida Republican.
[01:29:22.779 --> 01:29:28.722]  But then this was supposed to be a no-holds-barred discussion, and our constituents are upset.
[01:29:29.182 --> 01:29:30.282]  Yeah, stay upset.
[01:29:31.263 --> 01:29:35.025]  But don't worry, World Net Daily's got another article today about how amnesty isn't amnesty.
[01:29:35.405 --> 01:29:36.305]  I've read the bill, it is.
[01:29:36.986 --> 01:29:40.348]  So stop running offense and defense, you neocons.
[01:29:40.608 --> 01:29:41.128]  We'll be back.
[01:29:43.650 --> 01:29:44.531]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.032 --> 01:29:46.634]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.575 --> 01:29:50.238]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:53.709 --> 01:29:57.610]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:29:57.830 --> 01:30:10.113]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:30:10.533 --> 01:30:10.933]  The U.S.
[01:30:10.973 --> 01:30:16.555]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:30:16.955 --> 01:30:19.156]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:30:21.036 --> 01:30:21.496]  We're good to go.
[01:30:41.867 --> 01:30:45.889]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[01:30:46.010 --> 01:30:48.571]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:30:48.971 --> 01:30:49.351]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:30:49.532 --> 01:30:55.675]  Hey boys, Valentine's Day is coming.
[01:30:55.995 --> 01:30:58.457]  Why wait until Valentine's Day to surprise her?
[01:30:58.757 --> 01:31:01.959]  Visit Flowershop.com and send her flowers today.
[01:31:02.319 --> 01:31:07.022]  Nothing says romance like roses, and at Flowershop.com we know roses.
[01:31:07.242 --> 01:31:11.024]  We also know carnations, lilies, snapdragons, and gladiolas.
[01:31:11.328 --> 01:31:12.269]  We know flowers.
[01:31:12.649 --> 01:31:18.413]  We know the excitement that is created when a flower delivery person arrives in an office carrying a bouquet of flowers.
[01:31:18.633 --> 01:31:22.575]  The anticipation grows as everyone tries to guess who the lucky recipient is.
[01:31:22.915 --> 01:31:26.398]  And the joy and pride when the flowers are placed on her desk.
[01:31:26.598 --> 01:31:30.340]  We also know the envy of those at the desk as the flowers pass by.
[01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:33.122]  So don't wait until you're supposed to send flowers.
[01:31:33.402 --> 01:31:36.965]  Send them today and tell her you couldn't wait to tell her I love you.

[01:31:55.513 --> 01:31:59.337]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:31:59.677 --> 01:32:00.478]  Read the labels.
[01:32:00.918 --> 01:32:05.042]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:32:05.262 --> 01:32:09.447]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:32:09.827 --> 01:32:14.712]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:32:15.072 --> 01:32:18.674]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:32:18.854 --> 01:32:24.197]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.

[01:32:56.095 --> 01:33:02.139]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:33:02.759 --> 01:33:05.721]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:09.753 --> 01:33:13.554]  You know, this show, the stuff we talk about sounds crazy, because it is crazy.
[01:33:14.274 --> 01:33:15.094]  It's out of control.
[01:33:16.155 --> 01:33:23.277]  Cameras in school bathrooms and showers all over the country and Canada going in is 1984 and is insane.
[01:33:23.657 --> 01:33:25.957]  Would you ever believe five years ago that'd be happening?
[01:33:27.738 --> 01:33:31.119]  Would you ever believe they'd be on TV saying how all children need microchips?
[01:33:31.159 --> 01:33:32.179]  I've got them on video saying it.
[01:33:32.339 --> 01:33:34.280]  Andy Rooney saying we all need microchips.
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:35.400]  That's in road to tyranny.
[01:33:36.764 --> 01:33:38.245]  And now we have the Army documents.
[01:33:38.426 --> 01:33:40.387]  It's getting even worse what they're planning for us.
[01:33:40.667 --> 01:33:42.989]  We'll talk about that some with Lenny Bloom and Sherman Skolnick.
[01:33:43.530 --> 01:33:45.932]  I know we have Tim, Brandon, Ron, Wayne, Leslie, and others.
[01:33:45.952 --> 01:33:53.598]  And what we'll do is early in this interview, because I had a great discussion with Lenny and Sherman last night for an hour on the phone at my house.
[01:33:53.618 --> 01:33:56.400]  And it was very insightful and free-flowing.
[01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:59.603]  And so callers, we'll just start talking and taking your calls.
[01:33:59.643 --> 01:34:01.545]  And then we'll get more into how...
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:07.923]  Lenny Bloom's great show, number one show in the time slot, was canned up in Canada because he was talking about this.
[01:34:08.663 --> 01:34:09.683]  And I know how that feels.
[01:34:09.723 --> 01:34:11.304]  I've been told, shut up about the New World Order.
[01:34:11.344 --> 01:34:11.844]  You're fired.
[01:34:11.865 --> 01:34:13.285]  We don't care if you have number one ratings.
[01:34:13.925 --> 01:34:16.127]  And that even came out in the paper in Austin.
[01:34:16.167 --> 01:34:19.268]  And I was told to shut up about the New World Order and wouldn't do it.
[01:34:19.648 --> 01:34:23.610]  And so it's when you become a success that you have the problems.
[01:34:24.451 --> 01:34:27.172]  It isn't true that they just, quote, put on the air what gets listeners.
[01:34:28.719 --> 01:34:33.182]  So we'll talk about that as well and get into Sherman Skolnick's view on what the New World Order is up to.
[01:34:33.242 --> 01:34:38.366]  Before we do that, I do want to tell the listeners that I have made ten documentary films.
[01:34:39.206 --> 01:34:51.655]  And if you want to understand the cashless society control grid, the Patriot Act 1 and 2, the United Nations, the white slavery rings, the gun control, the PNAC group, what the New World Order is, get Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:34:52.115 --> 01:34:55.738]  My newest video is Matrix of Evil with Ron Paul, Cynthia McKinney,
[01:34:56.498 --> 01:35:02.343]  Frank Morales, Colonel Roberts, myself, throwing out the Patriot Act in Austin, just full of solutions.
[01:35:02.783 --> 01:35:05.205]  There's 9-11, Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror.
[01:35:05.265 --> 01:35:06.707]  They're all over two hours long.
[01:35:07.087 --> 01:35:09.389]  Some are two hours and 40 minutes like Police State 3.
[01:35:09.649 --> 01:35:11.470]  Some are two and a half hours like Road to Tyranny.
[01:35:12.391 --> 01:35:18.156]  They're $25.95, $20 when you order three or more, and your support is needed as well.
[01:35:19.013 --> 01:35:22.737]  That's another thing is you support what we're doing when you get the videos.
[01:35:23.298 --> 01:35:27.622]  I've also written a book, 9-11 Ascent to Tyranny, covering government-sponsored terror in 9-11.
[01:35:27.942 --> 01:35:32.868]  Paul Watson's written the definitive book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite-Sponsored Terror in the New World Order.
[01:35:32.888 --> 01:35:33.528]  That's available.
[01:35:33.769 --> 01:35:40.275]  We've got the Loss of Liberty video about how government tried to sink that ship to blame it on the Egyptians for World War III.
[01:35:41.474 --> 01:35:46.136]  And by the way, Admiral Moore just went public and said, look, they attacked the ship deliberately.
[01:35:46.516 --> 01:35:48.117]  I was the chairman, joint chiefs of staff.
[01:35:48.357 --> 01:35:49.298]  I'm tired of the lies.
[01:35:49.358 --> 01:35:50.318]  I'm tired of the spin.
[01:35:50.638 --> 01:35:52.419]  He's more hardcore than ever on that.
[01:35:53.620 --> 01:35:58.702]  And we've had the captains and the admirals and all of them on the show and the enlisted sailors.
[01:35:59.903 --> 01:36:01.484]  We got that video, Loss of Liberty.
[01:36:02.164 --> 01:36:05.266]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:36:05.426 --> 01:36:06.026]  Get the video.
[01:36:06.593 --> 01:36:11.157]  And when you get my videos, you're authorized to make copies of them for non-profit, not for self-purposes.
[01:36:11.317 --> 01:36:12.378]  I want you to make copies.
[01:36:12.658 --> 01:36:14.079]  I want you to put them on AXS TV.
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:18.443]  I want you to get them to talk show hosts and pastors and rabbis and everybody else.
[01:36:18.823 --> 01:36:22.847]  I want to wake people up, and it's having an effect, but not fast enough.
[01:36:22.887 --> 01:36:26.310]  We're in this fight, folks, but we've got to turn the heat up if we're going to win.
[01:36:27.646 --> 01:36:28.787]  Here's the toll-free number.
[01:36:28.807 --> 01:36:29.287]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:36:29.327 --> 01:36:29.627]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:36:29.667 --> 01:36:31.008]  Or just write to me.
[01:36:31.268 --> 01:36:33.449]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:36:51.892 --> 01:36:56.373]  Okay, going to Sherman Skolnick and Lenny Blum, and then in this segment, folks, we'll get to some of these calls.
[01:36:56.413 --> 01:36:59.314]  You've been holding too long, but have your question or comment ready.
[01:37:00.254 --> 01:37:05.315]  We can all just have like a giant free-for-all here, kind of a roundtable situation.
[01:37:06.556 --> 01:37:13.217]  Just in a few minutes, because I know you guys don't want to spend too much time on it, and, of course, the website's cloakanddagger.ca.
[01:37:14.658 --> 01:37:15.198]  Hello, Sherman.
[01:37:17.162 --> 01:37:25.609]  In a nutshell, what happened to the Cloak and Dagger Show that had become the number one show in that time slot in many of the key demographics in Toronto, Canada?
[01:37:27.470 --> 01:37:30.813]  To give background for those that may not be familiar with our work?
[01:37:31.274 --> 01:37:31.894]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:37:33.275 --> 01:37:35.857]  Since 1958, I've been a court reformer.
[01:37:36.938 --> 01:37:43.904]  Since 63, 40 years now, I've been the founder and chairman of the Citizens Committee to Clean Up the Courts,
[01:37:44.893 --> 01:37:49.596]  Our work includes identifying judicial bribery and political murders.
[01:37:50.176 --> 01:38:12.770]  In the 40 years of our group's work with volunteer investigators all over with over a million records, videotapes, and so on, most all the judges in the history of the United States that were sent to jail for bribery were sent in the last 40 years by our work.
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:14.321]  I'm not bragging.
[01:38:14.621 --> 01:38:17.603]  I'm telling you it is very tedious work.
[01:38:18.364 --> 01:38:30.673]  I've been sent to jail, not because I'm a criminal, but repeatedly for contempt of court because our policy is not with rumors or poison pen letters.
[01:38:31.193 --> 01:38:34.976]  We have confronted judges in court to their face.
[01:38:35.643 --> 01:38:44.109]  And Sherman, Sherman, Sherman, and they've almost killed you, and of course you're also in a wheelchair, but that didn't stop them.
[01:38:44.909 --> 01:38:45.730]  All right.
[01:38:47.591 --> 01:38:51.774]  Years ago, I used to teach investigation at a radio broadcast school.
[01:38:52.394 --> 01:39:02.061]  So for the 40 years, I've been on the periphery of broadcasting, and I know most of the celebrities in there and a lot of their dark secrets.
[01:39:02.808 --> 01:39:15.733]  And I dare mention a lot of the forbidden subjects, and as time permits, we're going to get a list of the forbidden subjects that Lenny Bloom and I and others on his program...
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:42.295]  Now, Sherman, in one of the last shows that you guys did, and you do interviews all over the country, but Lenny's particular show that you were a regular on, in the last show, or the four last shows, you had myself and, of course, Andres Von Bulow, the German technology minister, on going over it, and the show hit number one ratings, and that's when they seem to can things if they get out of control.
[01:39:42.595 --> 01:39:44.456]  Lenny Bloom, tell folks about what happened.
[01:39:44.776 --> 01:39:51.161]  Well, it certainly was a dagger aimed at Big Brother's Achilles heel, and it hit pretty hard.
[01:39:51.721 --> 01:40:09.735]  And as soon as we put the links to the MP3s on our website, just at the time of the show, as we were going to the show, we linked it up just before the show, about an hour before it,
[01:40:10.353 --> 01:40:36.942]  And they get their computers hooked up to the phone lines, and the computers start millions and millions of lines, start basically trunk lines into the Internet, start hitting your server with requests to give the home page and put up the home page, and that it starts to slow down the computer, slow down the computer, and they block you,
[01:40:37.461 --> 01:40:40.283]  And they blocked the public from the site on the internet.
[01:40:40.303 --> 01:40:45.688]  Okay, well, being clear, just saying it in ten words, you're talking about you've had denial of service attacks.
[01:40:46.268 --> 01:40:53.214]  Oh, yes, we've had denial of service attacks, and they've done everything to stop us, and the last straw was take us off the radio.
[01:40:54.715 --> 01:40:57.137]  Absolutely, we've had all that diagnosed here as well.
[01:40:57.417 --> 01:41:03.942]  And too much truth was given to the sheeple, and the Bush crime cartel couldn't let it continue.
[01:41:04.363 --> 01:41:05.924]  Well, I know for a fact that
[01:41:07.034 --> 01:41:14.116]  When Jay Leno talked about me on the Tonight Show, the owners of Shamrock Communications flew down to Austin.
[01:41:14.136 --> 01:41:16.096]  They own radio stations, newspapers, all this stuff.
[01:41:16.596 --> 01:41:17.216]  They flew down.
[01:41:17.356 --> 01:41:30.540]  The guy walked up, actually slapped me on the cheek and said, and this is six years ago now, and said, and I've just become syndicated, and they said, look, if you don't shop about Bill Clinton and the New World Order and this Waco thing, you're off the air.
[01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:32.360]  I said, but my show's number one.
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:33.420]  It's making you all this money.
[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:35.401]  I go, well, you know, I'm getting paid almost nothing.
[01:41:35.921 --> 01:41:36.181]  Why?
[01:41:36.798 --> 01:41:38.224]  And they just said, look, we want to keep you.
[01:41:38.244 --> 01:41:39.046]  Just shut up.
[01:41:39.127 --> 01:41:40.452]  We've been told, shut up.
[01:41:41.241 --> 01:41:42.963]  And I said, no, I'm not going to shut up.
[01:41:43.383 --> 01:41:45.985]  And a couple, you know, 11 weeks later, they went ahead and canned me.
[01:41:46.625 --> 01:41:49.628]  But then, of course, the show just got bigger and bigger, but that's where it was coming out of.
[01:41:49.688 --> 01:41:52.650]  So I have experienced this exact type of thing.
[01:41:52.670 --> 01:41:56.714]  Now, there's a bunch of issues I want to get into, but I promise these callers have been holding forever.
[01:41:56.734 --> 01:41:57.894]  We'll go to these calls, bam, bam, bam.
[01:41:57.914 --> 01:42:04.520]  We're going to have you guys for the whole next hour or two, so we'll get into a whole host of issues and some of the latest news and get your take on it.
[01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:08.123]  Tim in Ohio, you're on the air with Sherman Skolnick and Lenny Bloom.
[01:42:08.163 --> 01:42:08.503]  Go ahead.
[01:42:09.855 --> 01:42:12.516]  It's a pleasure to talk to you three warriors.
[01:42:12.876 --> 01:42:18.437]  Alex, I wanted to ask you, have you ever heard of a publication called The Journal or T.H.E.
[01:42:18.517 --> 01:42:18.857]  Journal?
[01:42:20.377 --> 01:42:20.617]  No.
[01:42:21.277 --> 01:42:22.818]  Boy, it's hard to throw a fastball past you.
[01:42:22.878 --> 01:42:24.318]  It's called, the T.H.E.
[01:42:24.358 --> 01:42:26.818]  stands for Technical Horizons in Education.
[01:42:26.858 --> 01:42:31.139]  I want to send you a copy of this, and there's a little thing in the middle where you can get your own free subscription if you want.
[01:42:31.719 --> 01:42:34.280]  There was an article in there called High Tech Science.
[01:42:34.727 --> 01:42:35.127]  I'm sorry.
[01:42:35.147 --> 01:42:41.272]  High Tech Campus Safety Report was the headline in the article, Creating Safer and More Efficient Schools.
[01:42:41.372 --> 01:42:42.012]  Let me guess.
[01:42:42.232 --> 01:42:46.995]  Everybody will have to wear an ID badge with an RFID chip that tracks wherever you go in the school.
[01:42:47.236 --> 01:42:49.397]  Yeah, it's definitely dealing with the biometrics.
[01:42:49.457 --> 01:42:56.862]  I wanted to, if I could, just a couple of sentences here and let you know, when you read through the lines and you talk to these guys, you can definitely see what's coming.
[01:42:57.303 --> 01:43:02.226]  Quickly, the most sophisticated non-metric identification systems use smart cards.
[01:43:02.657 --> 01:43:06.559]  And, you know, the card is, of course, the stepping stone to the programmable chip.
[01:43:07.019 --> 01:43:12.001]  These cards can hold a substantial amount of data and can be programmed or recharged depending on the application.
[01:43:13.502 --> 01:43:14.282]  Very interesting.
[01:43:15.683 --> 01:43:16.523]  Hold on just a second.
[01:43:16.563 --> 01:43:26.448]  Yeah, by the way, they're finding RFIDs in Walmart products, all over the world, store products, tracking what you do, hidden ones in furniture, hidden ones, total control.
[01:43:26.528 --> 01:43:30.790]  Sherman Skolnick, Lenny Bloom comments on this whole cashless society control grid.
[01:43:32.481 --> 01:43:33.642]  Can I answer this caller?
[01:43:34.103 --> 01:43:36.685]  Yes, that's what I said.
[01:43:37.045 --> 01:43:58.344]  On the website www.cloakanddagger.ca they have an archive of stories jointly written by me and Lenny Bloom called Middle Finger News and if you scroll on it you'll find a story about Walmart being a spy operation
[01:44:00.185 --> 01:44:06.427]  Working under contract for the secret political police, such as the FBI.
[01:44:06.668 --> 01:44:09.949]  By the way, a year ago, Catherine Albrecht brought that out.
[01:44:09.989 --> 01:44:15.852]  They got the public documents with Walmart meeting with Ridge and others with over 100 other CEOs.
[01:44:16.692 --> 01:44:28.418]  Yeah, so your listeners can read that for themselves, and that would be, I'm giving a short answer to a longer situation to your caller.
[01:44:29.232 --> 01:44:31.834]  Well, the question is, Lenny, how do we stop this?
[01:44:31.854 --> 01:44:34.196]  I mean, the average person still doesn't even know what's happening.
[01:44:35.077 --> 01:44:54.713]  Well, after we take the calls, Alex, I suggest that Lenny and I tell briefly what we're doing with the program and what type of subjects we're putting on the air that are considered generally absolutely forbidden subjects to be on major stations.
[01:44:55.013 --> 01:44:55.713]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:44:56.374 --> 01:44:58.836]  Let me just add one other thing.
[01:44:59.412 --> 01:45:22.908]  And that is, it was Von Bulow who pointed out, I think one of the most important parts of the Von Bulow thing, is that Von Bulow pointed out that, asked the question, is there somebody at all who can convince Americans against their media that what's being said about them in foreign lands is different from what's being said to them back at home?
[01:45:24.210 --> 01:45:29.632]  And that was a key of the Von Bulow thing that at some point today we want to really get into.
[01:45:29.652 --> 01:45:33.474]  Well, yeah, there's different brands of propaganda for different classes, different countries.
[01:45:33.914 --> 01:45:34.734]  Very sophisticated.
[01:45:34.834 --> 01:45:37.476]  Okay, let's talk to Brandon in Colorado.
[01:45:37.496 --> 01:45:38.196]  Go ahead, Brandon.
[01:45:38.216 --> 01:45:38.756]  You're on the air.
[01:45:41.217 --> 01:45:45.699]  I had heard of something called the Brussels Economic Accounting Surveillance Terminal.
[01:45:47.085 --> 01:45:52.709]  Well, that's one of the big computers that FinCEN here feeds into and the Interpol feeds into.
[01:45:52.929 --> 01:45:57.152]  Our state driver's licenses are already a world ID card.
[01:45:57.212 --> 01:46:00.314]  The same biometrics, the same numbers, the same standards.
[01:46:00.334 --> 01:46:02.156]  We already have a world ID card.
[01:46:03.197 --> 01:46:04.678]  They just don't announce it mainstream.
[01:46:04.718 --> 01:46:08.680]  But their own industry documents and press releases are bragging about this.
[01:46:09.041 --> 01:46:14.184]  And every person on the planet is listed in a data bank, Alex, with everything about them.
[01:46:14.525 --> 01:46:14.865]  Totally.
[01:46:14.885 --> 01:46:15.025]  Totally.
[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:19.222]  And do you know what they call it there in Brussels?
[01:46:20.102 --> 01:46:22.863]  Guess what they call that computer they set up in, what, 1982?
[01:46:23.243 --> 01:46:23.764]  Yeah.
[01:46:24.684 --> 01:46:25.925]  They call it the Beast.
[01:46:26.265 --> 01:46:26.385]  Yeah.
[01:46:26.405 --> 01:46:27.305]  I'm not kidding, folks.
[01:46:27.325 --> 01:46:28.806]  It tracks every person on the planet.
[01:46:30.246 --> 01:46:32.748]  Yeah, I just thought that had an interesting acronym for that.
[01:46:32.768 --> 01:46:36.809]  I was wondering, I hadn't been able to confirm whether it actually existed or not.
[01:46:37.069 --> 01:46:39.911]  Oh, I've seen hundreds of articles over the decades.
[01:46:39.931 --> 01:46:40.511]  Yeah, of course.
[01:46:41.363 --> 01:46:41.663]  Excellent.
[01:46:41.703 --> 01:46:43.624]  Well, thank you very much for taking my time.
[01:46:44.165 --> 01:46:44.645]  Thank you.
[01:46:44.665 --> 01:46:45.846]  You want to comment on that, Sherman?
[01:46:47.567 --> 01:47:08.159]  One of the things that I have brought out before the public about the media is that of the three major networks, from time to time, one of the networks, CBS, had the secret CIA subsidy, which means they ran their overseas branches
[01:47:08.772 --> 01:47:10.213]  Not to compile news.
[01:47:10.373 --> 01:47:19.077]  Very little news came out of the Moscow and London and other bureaus, but it was a vacuum pump for intelligence.
[01:47:19.718 --> 01:47:30.703]  And in 1988 and 1989, the CIA subsidy went to ABC Network, and it promoted the Ted Koppel Nightline program.
[01:47:31.183 --> 01:47:38.307]  Now there's a big fight between CBS and ABC because the CIA subsidy contract
[01:47:39.055 --> 01:47:39.596]  We're good to go.
[01:47:39.636 --> 01:47:39.997]  We're good to go.
[01:47:50.038 --> 01:47:51.659]  Well, hold on, Sherman.
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:56.683]  Sherman, let me get... Yeah, Sherman, let me... Actually, this has come out mainstream.
[01:47:57.464 --> 01:48:00.226]  Pentagon running CNN, that came out in 99.
[01:48:01.267 --> 01:48:06.711]  The Pentagon Office of Strategic Information two years ago said we're going to plant fake news stories and lie to you.
[01:48:07.612 --> 01:48:08.392]  We know that when you...
[01:48:10.854 --> 01:48:14.836]  The public service announcement money from the federal government is the payoff to the networks.
[01:48:15.116 --> 01:48:17.077]  By the way, it's in the tens of billions of dollars.
[01:48:18.278 --> 01:48:19.338]  Tune into all the networks.
[01:48:19.458 --> 01:48:22.680]  Every drama is about torture and secret arrests and how good it is.
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:38.688]  One of the forbidden subjects, Alex, is currently, that has started a week ago, a one-year-long expected trial of the Bank of England involved in a major scandal involving...
[01:48:39.284 --> 01:48:41.105]  The BCCI.
[01:48:41.245 --> 01:48:42.666]  Yeah, that came out in the Times of London.
[01:48:42.786 --> 01:48:56.656]  But the thing that I write about BCCI is that they played a key role with John Kerry, who's running for president, and with the formation of CNN with Ted Turner.
[01:48:57.216 --> 01:48:59.618]  And that is forbidden to be discussed.
[01:48:59.978 --> 01:49:04.141]  And it's that type of thing that gets you taken off the air, at least on major stations.
[01:49:04.764 --> 01:49:09.207]  Well, you know, again, they can target shows that are just on one station.
[01:49:09.807 --> 01:49:16.451]  And, again, I want to state, Sherman, that you say, you know, you have this, and you've been saying it for years, but it has come out now.
[01:49:17.032 --> 01:49:19.673]  I mean, the things you're saying are public.
[01:49:19.693 --> 01:49:23.596]  The point is, there is hardly any news.
[01:49:24.476 --> 01:49:28.759]  A journalist just called me from London before we went on the air with you, Alex.
[01:49:29.679 --> 01:49:43.170]  And there's only one person in the public gallery of the trial court in London where Bank of England is on trial for having committed a massive worldwide fraud regarding BCCI.
[01:49:43.270 --> 01:49:44.891]  Okay, we're going to go back to calls.
[01:49:44.991 --> 01:49:46.112]  Ron in New York, go ahead.
[01:49:46.132 --> 01:49:46.712]  You're on the air.
[01:49:48.213 --> 01:49:50.175]  There's a book, Total Surveillance.
[01:49:50.195 --> 01:49:50.876]  Hold on a minute.
[01:49:50.916 --> 01:49:52.136]  Turn your radio off, please.
[01:49:52.437 --> 01:49:57.721]  Okay, the NSA, the big brother NSA and his little brother is Terry Cook.
[01:49:58.864 --> 01:50:02.346]  The National Security Agency's Global Surveillance Network.
[01:50:02.366 --> 01:50:03.407]  You talked about the beast.
[01:50:04.067 --> 01:50:05.888]  Well, that's what that is, but that's the book.
[01:50:05.908 --> 01:50:25.420]  Of course, as you know, what we're fighting here is the setting of the stage to bring on the totalitarian Antichrist government and the people who don't believe this now will suffer later.
[01:50:26.201 --> 01:50:29.082]  According to 2 Thessalonians 10, 11, and 12.
[01:50:29.182 --> 01:50:33.583]  Well, there is a massive brainwashing operation going on.
[01:50:33.603 --> 01:50:39.784]  It includes the ad industry and the cell phone company transmitters and psycho-electronic mind control.
[01:50:40.044 --> 01:50:40.544]  Big stuff.
[01:50:40.564 --> 01:50:42.285]  It's been going on for decades.
[01:50:42.605 --> 01:50:44.085]  Yeah, we'll come back, finish up with the calls.
[01:50:44.105 --> 01:50:44.945]  I've been holding them the longest.
[01:50:44.965 --> 01:50:48.406]  Then we'll get more into key info.
[01:50:48.686 --> 01:50:50.447]  Sherman Skolnick and Lenny Bloom.
[01:50:50.587 --> 01:50:51.307]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:50:54.605 --> 01:51:01.256]  Men, how would you like to have a better sex life and no longer have to live with the fear of embarrassing poor sexual performance?
[01:51:01.817 --> 01:51:04.000]  Nearly every adult male has experienced it.
[01:51:04.381 --> 01:51:08.227]  In fact, most men over the age of 25 have a major decrease in vigor.
[01:51:08.843 --> 01:51:13.547]  But now, there's an easy, all-natural solution to this embarrassing sexual problem.

[01:51:45.018 --> 01:51:45.318]  That's 1-800-701-4640.
[01:51:53.334 --> 01:51:54.935]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:55.315 --> 01:52:01.058]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:52:01.318 --> 01:52:06.441]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:52:06.781 --> 01:52:16.066]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:52:16.406 --> 01:52:21.352]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:52:21.692 --> 01:52:25.697]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:52:25.897 --> 01:52:30.643]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:52:31.043 --> 01:52:36.950]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[01:52:49.120 --> 01:52:51.703]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:52:53.224 --> 01:52:57.548]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:52:57.748 --> 01:53:02.192]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:53:02.292 --> 01:53:02.432]  There
[01:53:05.238 --> 01:53:14.062]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:53:14.123 --> 01:53:21.066]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:53:21.186 --> 01:53:23.207]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:53:23.447 --> 01:53:33.994]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:53:34.194 --> 01:53:39.578]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:53:40.078 --> 01:53:42.740]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:45.121]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:03.121]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:54:03.762 --> 01:54:04.422]  until 2 p.m.
[01:54:04.843 --> 01:54:06.344]  Back from 9 to midnight central.
[01:54:06.584 --> 01:54:07.344]  We're here, folks.
[01:54:08.325 --> 01:54:10.106]  Talking to Sherman Skolnick and Lenny Bloom.
[01:54:11.027 --> 01:54:14.789]  Going to get more into some of the forbidden subjects in the next hour.
[01:54:15.770 --> 01:54:16.851]  And, of course, more of your calls.
[01:54:16.871 --> 01:54:20.814]  And I've got a bunch of topical news items I want to throw out at our guests to get their take on it.
[01:54:21.354 --> 01:54:22.695]  But I respect their take on it.
[01:54:23.035 --> 01:54:25.037]  Let's go ahead and talk to Wayne in Virginia.
[01:54:25.137 --> 01:54:26.398]  Wayne, you're on the air with our guests.
[01:54:26.438 --> 01:54:26.838]  Go ahead.
[01:54:27.959 --> 01:54:28.719]  Hey, good afternoon.
[01:54:29.159 --> 01:54:29.480]  Yes, sir.
[01:54:30.524 --> 01:54:41.133]  Alex, I wanted to ask you, and I'm sure your guests would like to chime in on this, about for you to just play teacher for a moment and tell us how this psychological inoculation occurs.
[01:54:41.934 --> 01:54:53.003]  You'd expect that with the revelations of a movie like Matrix or Minority Port, that when things actually began to develop that reflected those themes of the movies, that people would be indignant and say, you're not doing that here.
[01:54:53.649 --> 01:54:55.851]  But the movies don't have that effect.
[01:54:56.071 --> 01:55:02.615]  It actually desensitizes because the way mammals are designed, once we've been acclimated by something, we accept it even if it's horrible.
[01:55:02.635 --> 01:55:03.116]  And by the way...
[01:55:03.954 --> 01:55:07.515]  Stuff like Minority Report comes out after that stuff's already in place.
[01:55:07.895 --> 01:55:12.496]  The advertisement industry is already at that point of much of what you see in that film.
[01:55:14.417 --> 01:55:21.599]  Steven Spielberg attends, the only Hollywood person that does, Bilderberg group meetings almost every year, and that's mainstream news.
[01:55:21.659 --> 01:55:23.019]  Lenny Bloom, do you want to talk about this?
[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:25.640]  Yeah, I'll just sum it up.
[01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:28.941]  If you put people inside a microwave oven and
[01:55:29.491 --> 01:55:30.952]  Turn on the heat.
[01:55:31.452 --> 01:55:33.614]  You're going to start to heat their brains up.
[01:55:33.914 --> 01:55:38.557]  And they've got these cell sites and they're broadcasting from the cell sites.
[01:55:38.617 --> 01:55:42.459]  And now you're living in a city, but it's really a microwave oven.
[01:55:44.175 --> 01:55:44.735]  Come on.
[01:55:45.435 --> 01:55:53.377]  And by the way, for folks that don't believe that, the Army War College, the Boston Globe, they are saying they want to put mine control towers up.
[01:55:54.037 --> 01:55:56.997]  I mean, that sounds totally nuts, but that's mainstream news.
[01:55:57.057 --> 01:55:59.538]  And again, you wonder why folks can't respond to it.
[01:56:00.458 --> 01:56:04.059]  It sounds like science fiction, but it's going on.
[01:56:04.619 --> 01:56:05.059]  Sherman?
[01:56:06.619 --> 01:56:08.579]  I could just answer that briefly.
[01:56:09.620 --> 01:56:10.620]  I was the one in the 1970s
[01:56:12.679 --> 01:56:19.142]  That broke the story of the CIA mind control program called MKUltra.
[01:56:20.142 --> 01:56:24.724]  And in the beginning, people were so naive, they heckled me.
[01:56:24.764 --> 01:56:29.246]  They said, Skaldik, why are you talking about a British toothpaste?
[01:56:29.326 --> 01:56:31.507]  I said, it is not a British toothpaste.
[01:56:32.028 --> 01:56:36.309]  It's the code name of a CIA mind control program.
[01:56:37.210 --> 01:56:39.831]  And in the 70s, believe it or not, Alex,
[01:56:40.544 --> 01:56:42.905]  Only a porno rag in L.A.
[01:56:43.585 --> 01:56:45.766]  dared run my story verbatim.
[01:56:46.407 --> 01:56:48.948]  None of the other publications would go near it.
[01:56:49.468 --> 01:56:50.609]  Not for several years.
[01:56:51.709 --> 01:57:00.113]  Yeah, Van Bulow talked about how there was the 9-11 story and there was the cover story and the cover cover story.
[01:57:01.099 --> 01:57:06.062]  And it's quite interesting, you know, the self-inflicted wound.
[01:57:06.082 --> 01:57:09.364]  9-11 was a self-inflicted wound.
[01:57:09.384 --> 01:57:14.026]  The Bushy struck the blow, and the Arabs were the patsies.
[01:57:14.707 --> 01:57:20.350]  But they covered it up, and the FBI guys who covered it up were the ones who got the big promotions.
[01:57:21.410 --> 01:57:26.313]  So Von Bulow said, how come the guys who covered it up so well all got promoted?
[01:57:27.372 --> 01:57:29.153]  And that's why they took us off the air.
[01:57:29.233 --> 01:57:30.473]  Well, yeah, that's what scares them.
[01:57:30.493 --> 01:57:31.253]  And it's happened to me.
[01:57:31.293 --> 01:57:38.376]  When a show hits number one in a city, I mean, they will buy it, do whatever they have to, to stop it.
[01:57:38.476 --> 01:57:41.017]  And I've been told, shut up about the New World Order.
[01:57:41.037 --> 01:57:42.878]  Well, I'm number one.
[01:57:43.018 --> 01:57:44.138]  Well, we don't care.
[01:57:44.578 --> 01:57:45.699]  Shut up about it.
[01:57:46.199 --> 01:57:49.780]  And shut up about the Counter-Reformation Offensive.
[01:57:50.681 --> 01:57:53.702]  What I call the Counter-Reformation Offensive.
[01:57:54.521 --> 01:57:55.101]  We've got a break.
[01:57:55.121 --> 01:58:02.626]  We'll come back and finish up with Leslie and John and David and Phillip and a few others.
[01:58:02.666 --> 01:58:10.510]  Then we're going to not take calls for 20 minutes or so and get into some of these news items and then go back into calls with our two guests, Sherman Skolnick and, of course, Lenny Bloom.
[01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:15.593]  And the website is cloakanddagger.ca based out of Toronto, Canada.
[01:58:15.613 --> 01:58:18.354]  And, of course, Sherman Skolnick is in Chicago, Illinois.
[01:58:18.874 --> 01:58:23.497]  I'm Alex Jones coming to you live from Austin, Texas on this live Friday edition.
[01:58:24.884 --> 01:58:25.385]  Stay with us.
[01:58:25.445 --> 01:58:26.126]  We'll be back.
[01:58:26.166 --> 01:58:29.651]  Got a bunch of different news items I want to get our listeners and our guests take on.
[01:58:29.671 --> 01:58:37.863]  I want to talk about the missing weapons of mass destruction and the bizarre spin now that, oh, we never said that when everybody knows they did.
[01:58:37.963 --> 01:58:39.245]  I mean, it's getting pretty bold.
[01:58:39.605 --> 01:58:40.346]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:40.366 --> 01:58:40.747]  Stay with us.
[01:58:43.681 --> 01:58:46.962]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:58:47.022 --> 01:58:51.203]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:58:51.444 --> 01:58:54.244]  But if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:58:54.425 --> 01:58:56.825]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:58:57.005 --> 01:59:05.668]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:59:05.848 --> 01:59:07.189]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:59:07.389 --> 01:59:11.510]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:12.091]  We're good to go.
[01:59:30.828 --> 01:59:31.068]  Big Brother.
[01:59:31.088 --> 01:59:31.608]  Mainstream Media.
[01:59:53.289 --> 01:59:54.390]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:55.050 --> 01:59:55.851]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.632 --> 01:59:57.512]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.532 --> 02:00:01.835]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.376 --> 02:00:06.499]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:08.540 --> 02:00:09.261]  All right, folks.
[02:00:09.401 --> 02:00:13.264]  Into the third and final hour with Sherman Skolnick and Lenny Bloom.
[02:00:14.805 --> 02:00:18.027]  SkolnicksReport.com and CloakandDagger.ca.
[02:00:18.047 --> 02:00:21.910]  My website, SinfulWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:00:23.494 --> 02:00:28.558]  And your calls are coming up in the next segment, but I wanted to ask Sherman Skolnick a question.
[02:00:29.199 --> 02:00:37.005]  And Sherman, I know you know all about this corruption of the courts, the Supreme Court and all that, but how they put it right out in the open, kind of a psychological inoculation.
[02:00:37.305 --> 02:00:40.007]  Houston Chronicle a couple days ago, I covered it yesterday.
[02:00:41.312 --> 02:00:44.235]  Admits it's a felony, but says, eh, no big deal.
[02:00:44.995 --> 02:00:54.063]  Anthony Scalia, Supreme Court Justice, is about to hear a case concerning the cover-ups and obstruction by Dick Cheney of Energy Commission documents.
[02:00:54.584 --> 02:01:01.410]  And two weeks before this is coming up, they're off on vacations together on Air Force Two, and he's taking Scalia hunting.
[02:01:02.914 --> 02:01:07.077]  Now, in a mafia case, imagine the mob boss taking the judge on vacation.
[02:01:07.418 --> 02:01:10.180]  This is patently illegal, but they do it out in the open.
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:11.381]  Don't even hide it.
[02:01:12.222 --> 02:01:15.545]  Your comments on that and just why they're so arrogant.
[02:01:17.126 --> 02:01:28.276]  Well, we have a series on our website, SkolnicksReport.com, called Coca-Cola CIA in the Courts.
[02:01:29.603 --> 02:01:43.576]  And there you will see a court-filed petition setting forth the four judges within the court system, well, more than four judges, within the U.S.
[02:01:43.616 --> 02:01:55.207]  Supreme Court and one step below who are under financial control, including Anton Scalia.
[02:01:56.161 --> 02:01:58.482]  They use money from Coca-Cola.
[02:01:58.682 --> 02:02:02.562]  The time doesn't permit on the radio to give all the details.
[02:02:02.642 --> 02:02:12.925]  However, the details are set forth in the series that I've just mentioned on our website, and that's Coca-Cola CIA.
[02:02:12.945 --> 02:02:18.946]  Yeah, but I want you to comment, Sherman, specifically on them out in the open engaging in crimes in front of us.
[02:02:19.730 --> 02:02:27.616]  Well, we remember telling state secrets is not allowed, even if they are right under the public's noses, right, Sherman?
[02:02:28.017 --> 02:02:31.039]  Well, here's the thing that I want to get to, just briefly.
[02:02:31.099 --> 02:02:33.261]  Telling state secrets is verboten.
[02:02:34.822 --> 02:02:46.111]  Scalia and others high up in the court system, identified by us, while on the bench, continue to represent...
[02:02:46.724 --> 02:02:57.306]  The billion-dollar stock portfolio of the University of Chicago from whose law school Scalia and the other three come from.
[02:02:58.198 --> 02:02:59.779]  And they should disclose that.
[02:03:00.179 --> 02:03:02.140]  Sherman, Sherman, I understand that.
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:10.864]  I want you to comment on how Dick Cheney can publicly violate federal law and fly around and take the... Well, they're knights of this star chamber.
[02:03:10.904 --> 02:03:11.925]  They're above the law.
[02:03:11.985 --> 02:03:12.445]  Come on.
[02:03:12.885 --> 02:03:14.006]  That's the point I want to make here.
[02:03:14.046 --> 02:03:15.647]  I want to get your take on them.
[02:03:15.667 --> 02:03:18.048]  Sherman, they're knights of the star chamber.
[02:03:18.628 --> 02:03:19.989]  They're above it.
[02:03:20.009 --> 02:03:22.070]  That's the aristocracy's rule.
[02:03:22.490 --> 02:03:24.271]  Alex, one of the things that we write about
[02:03:25.154 --> 02:03:36.036]  is the dispute behind the scenes between George W. Bush and Richard Cheney over a division of the oil.
[02:03:36.676 --> 02:03:54.479]  Cheney is in with those that are involved with the Trans-Siberian oil pipeline headed for Japan, whereas Bush is involved with the one that was proposed to go through Afghanistan, and that underlies some of these situations that you're talking about
[02:03:55.331 --> 02:03:56.172]  I understand that.
[02:03:56.192 --> 02:04:05.057]  The point I'm trying to make here is, folks, out in the open, you've got the judge ruling on a case that's coming up.
[02:04:13.698 --> 02:04:18.541]  ...concerning Dick Cheney, and Dick Cheney's taking him on all-expense-paid vacations.
[02:04:19.102 --> 02:04:21.323]  Openly, publicly criminal.
[02:04:21.563 --> 02:04:24.586]  The Houston Chronicle admits it, and nothing's going to be done to him.
[02:04:24.706 --> 02:04:27.447]  I just want to point this out.
[02:04:28.608 --> 02:04:29.949]  In the past, they weren't this obvious.
[02:04:30.329 --> 02:04:36.374]  These are the expert geopolitical mapmakers employed by the crown heads of Europe.
[02:04:37.975 --> 02:04:39.956]  Alex... I tell you what, we've got to break, Sherman.
[02:04:39.976 --> 02:04:41.937]  We'll let you comment when we get back, and we'll go to the calls.
[02:04:41.957 --> 02:04:42.658]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:04:46.849 --> 02:04:48.910]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[02:04:49.070 --> 02:04:50.712]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot.
[02:04:50.852 --> 02:04:58.837]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[02:04:59.077 --> 02:05:05.521]  Imagine hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini, followed by peaches, mixed fruit, or pineapple for dessert.
[02:05:05.701 --> 02:05:06.942]  Just a few of the many selections.
[02:05:07.142 --> 02:05:10.465]  Visit www.longlifefood.com for a complete menu.
[02:05:23.217 --> 02:05:27.199]  Long-term storable MREs make for convenience when camping, hiking, or canoeing.
[02:05:27.419 --> 02:05:28.299]  No fires allowed.
[02:05:28.439 --> 02:05:29.440]  Hot meals still are.
[02:05:29.560 --> 02:05:34.762]  Call the Long Life Food Depot toll-free at 800-601-2833.
[02:05:34.882 --> 02:05:35.942]  That's 1-800-601-2833.

[02:05:42.465 --> 02:05:42.905]  Don't wait.

[02:05:45.655 --> 02:05:49.137]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:05:49.397 --> 02:05:52.898]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:05:52.998 --> 02:05:56.940]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:05:57.160 --> 02:06:03.322]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:06:03.723 --> 02:06:11.646]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:06:12.046 --> 02:06:17.410]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:06:17.550 --> 02:06:21.333]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:06:21.693 --> 02:06:23.555]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[02:06:23.615 --> 02:06:25.777]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:06:26.017 --> 02:06:30.380]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[02:06:30.660 --> 02:06:36.545]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:06:39.707 --> 02:06:43.768]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:06:44.308 --> 02:06:51.150]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny on DVD.
[02:06:51.450 --> 02:06:52.830]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:06:53.010 --> 02:06:55.210]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:06:55.370 --> 02:06:57.451]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:06:57.731 --> 02:07:02.692]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:07:03.012 --> 02:07:07.033]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:07:07.293 --> 02:07:09.074]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:07:09.134 --> 02:07:19.800]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and planable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:07:19.941 --> 02:07:21.842]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:07:22.062 --> 02:07:25.924]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[02:07:26.004 --> 02:07:27.425]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[02:07:27.445 --> 02:07:27.665]  That's 888-2533-139.
[02:07:34.329 --> 02:07:34.729]  Big Brother.
[02:07:34.909 --> 02:07:35.690]  Mainstream media.
[02:07:35.710 --> 02:07:36.630]  Government cover-ups.
[02:07:36.751 --> 02:07:37.511]  You want answers?
[02:07:56.721 --> 02:07:57.602]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:57.622 --> 02:08:02.224]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:02.464 --> 02:08:06.566]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:09.627 --> 02:08:15.770]  In the last segment, I bring up the Houston Chronicle article, and there are others.
[02:08:17.211 --> 02:08:22.894]  Where we've got Dick Cheney on Air Force Two, flying around on multiple hunting trips...
[02:08:24.466 --> 02:08:29.874]  While the Supreme Court prepares to hear a case concerning Dick Cheney, flying him around duck hunting.
[02:08:31.195 --> 02:08:32.497]  Now that's publicly criminal.
[02:08:33.098 --> 02:08:38.145]  And I understand why Sherman goes, okay, we're talking about Scalia and Cheney, let's talk about the really big corrupt things they're doing.
[02:08:39.165 --> 02:08:44.928]  I mean, sure, we can talk about $87 billion and no bids allowed and Halliburton and scamming and admittedly stealing.
[02:08:44.948 --> 02:08:46.409]  Can I answer your previous question?
[02:08:46.629 --> 02:08:48.230]  Well, hold on just a second, Sherman.
[02:08:48.250 --> 02:08:50.351]  I mean, I understand going into all that.
[02:08:50.491 --> 02:08:55.273]  I'm just pointing out that out in the open they commit felonies right in front of us and can carry less.
[02:08:55.313 --> 02:08:55.753]  Go ahead.
[02:08:56.434 --> 02:08:59.975]  From my 40 years of experience, here is a quick answer.
[02:09:01.576 --> 02:09:07.019]  The federal system, in particular in the courts, is loaded with these conflicts of interest
[02:09:07.987 --> 02:09:25.591]  There is no remedy unless somehow, to very clever means, any of us alternative media people are able to touch off a major scandal wherein the aristocracy has to throw away one of these judges.
[02:09:26.151 --> 02:09:37.693]  Unless and until you could set off somehow a major scandal, these types of conflicts of interest are inherent in an inherently corrupt
[02:09:39.728 --> 02:09:46.772]  I understand that, but it seems that they're doing psychological inoculation where they openly now do it and go, so what?
[02:09:46.832 --> 02:09:49.814]  Whereas in the past, they would creep around and do all this.
[02:09:50.394 --> 02:09:53.616]  Now they go, yeah, Halliburton ripped everybody off and double-charged.
[02:09:53.696 --> 02:09:58.079]  The sheeple are deeply asleep.
[02:09:58.259 --> 02:10:00.841]  They don't have to worry about it anymore.
[02:10:00.961 --> 02:10:04.843]  Alex, they bombard us with other irrelevant information.
[02:10:05.444 --> 02:10:05.884]  Sports.
[02:10:06.596 --> 02:10:08.197]  Weather reports and so on.
[02:10:08.257 --> 02:10:09.017]  Janet Jackson.
[02:10:09.097 --> 02:10:12.179]  And it does not become a major scandal and they get away with it.
[02:10:12.739 --> 02:10:13.019]  Yeah.
[02:10:13.619 --> 02:10:23.224]  You know, James, you know, long ago Americans resigned their consciences over to the bureaucrats who are now under the control of the monarchies themselves.
[02:10:24.004 --> 02:10:24.965]  It's real simple.
[02:10:26.627 --> 02:10:27.447]  There have been books...
[02:10:55.433 --> 02:10:55.973]  I think so.
[02:11:25.123 --> 02:11:29.847]  Top officials of the local media have been mysteriously winners of the lottery.
[02:11:29.967 --> 02:11:31.208]  Oh, that's happened in Austin!
[02:11:31.589 --> 02:11:32.810]  That's happened in Austin!
[02:11:32.850 --> 02:11:40.517]  The state representative in the Assembly, the legislature, that introduced the lottery law, he won millions.
[02:11:41.187 --> 02:11:44.729]  A police chief and fire chief in one of the suburbs, Juan.
[02:11:45.050 --> 02:11:45.550]  Exactly.
[02:11:45.570 --> 02:11:48.992]  There's an executive manager of radio stations here.
[02:11:49.052 --> 02:11:50.794]  Let me stop you, Sherman.
[02:11:51.034 --> 02:11:51.954]  Sherman, Sherman.
[02:11:52.034 --> 02:11:53.656]  Sherman, Sherman, hold on.
[02:11:54.296 --> 02:11:57.098]  Right here in Austin, Hollywood Henderson.
[02:11:58.219 --> 02:12:06.486]  The cowboy football player who does a lot of government work and anti-drug propaganda, he magically won, what was it, 30 mil?
[02:12:07.287 --> 02:12:07.787]  Exactly.
[02:12:07.867 --> 02:12:10.849]  Police chiefs, people that pass the lottery laws.
[02:12:10.869 --> 02:12:12.270]  I just told you how it's done.
[02:12:12.651 --> 02:12:14.532]  Well, listen, that's what I've got.
[02:12:15.653 --> 02:12:16.614]  We've talked to people.
[02:12:17.758 --> 02:12:24.342]  At the news stations where they shoot the lottery and they say, oh, we'll shoot it four or five times, quote, until we get the balls to come out right.
[02:12:24.862 --> 02:12:28.203]  And then I've talked to people at the stores where they sell the lotteries.
[02:12:28.223 --> 02:12:34.947]  They go, yeah, 45 minutes before the lottery's called, they shut it down and then we know that they're shaping the numbers.
[02:12:35.467 --> 02:12:36.888]  This isn't just a real lottery.
[02:12:37.188 --> 02:12:38.849]  They'd run it up to two minutes before.
[02:12:39.189 --> 02:12:45.552]  Sherman, what about the lottery reminds us of the extortion money Bush is paying to keep things quiet.
[02:12:45.572 --> 02:12:58.559]  By the way, by the way, by the way, what really got the Fortunate Son guy who wrote, the Hatfield who wrote Fortunate Son whacked, is his book is about Bush and the lottery scamming here in Texas.
[02:12:59.579 --> 02:13:00.360]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:13:02.671 --> 02:13:11.337]  Another thing that you should keep in mind, Alex, is one of the aspects of the Enron scandal, which is from Texas.
[02:13:11.537 --> 02:13:12.277]  Money laundering.
[02:13:13.418 --> 02:13:21.243]  One of the officials that has so far escaped was a director of the Houston Federal Reserve District Bank.
[02:13:21.343 --> 02:13:22.564]  Nobody talks about it.
[02:13:23.164 --> 02:13:31.089]  What happened is that the Federal Reserve skimmed off or embezzled billions of dollars from Enron, causing them to go bankrupt.
[02:13:31.630 --> 02:13:42.999]  And the money is being used through hocus pocus called derivatives to temporarily pump up the stock market to get the suckers in at the top so they can be clipped.
[02:13:43.279 --> 02:13:44.820]  Do you understand?
[02:13:45.321 --> 02:13:49.804]  And they write about Enron and they leave off the main important thing.
[02:13:50.324 --> 02:13:55.448]  A fellow named Skilling was a director of the Houston Federal Reserve District Bank.
[02:13:55.669 --> 02:13:56.990]  But that's a forbidden subject.
[02:13:57.010 --> 02:13:58.711]  You don't discuss the Federal Reserve.
[02:13:59.475 --> 02:14:01.797]  And the money that was skimmed off of Enron?
[02:14:02.137 --> 02:14:07.802]  And what about Wendy Graham, the wife of retired Senator Phil Graham of Texas?
[02:14:09.163 --> 02:14:17.989]  How come she's not being prosecuted for reportedly covering up the massive fraud of Enron of which she was a director?
[02:14:18.149 --> 02:14:22.493]  And Hollywood did a whole movie of it called Die Hard with a Vengeance.
[02:14:22.553 --> 02:14:24.254]  That whole thing with Die Hard where...
[02:14:24.764 --> 02:14:27.825]  Where ultimately it was just a heist of the U.S.
[02:14:27.965 --> 02:14:28.605]  Treasury.
[02:14:28.985 --> 02:14:31.066]  That's what's been going on for decades.
[02:14:31.406 --> 02:14:36.207]  Phony ways to fleece the sheeple and take money out of the U.S.
[02:14:36.267 --> 02:14:36.827]  Treasury.
[02:14:37.167 --> 02:14:39.668]  Sherman, Sherman, I talked to you on air.
[02:14:39.708 --> 02:14:40.928]  I talked to you for an hour last night.
[02:14:40.948 --> 02:14:42.048]  I didn't bring up the lottery.
[02:14:43.309 --> 02:14:43.929]  I bring it up.
[02:14:44.249 --> 02:14:48.330]  What you say from your 40 years of research, and folks, it's backed up,
[02:14:49.329 --> 02:14:51.110]  It's exactly the info I have.
[02:14:51.690 --> 02:14:58.493]  And, yeah, I mean, do people in Illinois question that it's police chiefs and the people that pass the lottery?
[02:14:58.813 --> 02:15:00.034]  Alex, you're missing the point.
[02:15:00.514 --> 02:15:08.078]  The major blowtorch stations here get advertisements from the lottery and the gambling casinos.
[02:15:08.458 --> 02:15:10.999]  That's forbidden to say anything negative about them.
[02:15:11.479 --> 02:15:17.422]  Listen, how would it be if the major radio stations here pointed out that their own bosses...
[02:15:17.867 --> 02:15:19.775]  Mysteriously won the lottery.
[02:15:20.317 --> 02:15:22.064]  What are the chances?
[02:15:22.284 --> 02:15:23.810]  One in a hundred billion million?
[02:15:24.335 --> 02:15:28.676]  That the executives and managers of the radio stations win the lottery?
[02:15:28.936 --> 02:15:29.636]  Come on!
[02:15:29.696 --> 02:15:38.498]  Look, guys, I'm saying, you talk about the sheeple, they've got the lotteries, their own private payoff system, and the average idiot's still buying it.
[02:15:40.438 --> 02:15:42.839]  And people say, oh, no, they never know.
[02:15:42.979 --> 02:15:49.900]  Oh, no, the people that run gambling, hold on a second, the people that run gambling, they're real trustworthy.
[02:15:50.161 --> 02:15:52.041]  Let's just, come on, folks.
[02:15:53.197 --> 02:15:54.658]  Talk radio for spies.
[02:15:54.698 --> 02:15:57.720]  You became a spy when the media betrayed you.
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:15:58.980]  Betrayed the truth.
[02:16:00.641 --> 02:16:06.485]  Alex, casinos and lottery swindles are a forbidden subject.
[02:16:07.225 --> 02:16:09.626]  You can't put that on a major talk station.
[02:16:09.666 --> 02:16:10.207]  Come on!
[02:16:10.287 --> 02:16:11.087]  It's forbidden!
[02:16:11.528 --> 02:16:15.670]  I call it cabal capitalism now, Alex.
[02:16:16.090 --> 02:16:17.451]  It's cabal capitalism.
[02:16:18.118 --> 02:16:22.360]  It doesn't work without conspiracies and covers for the conspiracies.
[02:16:22.400 --> 02:16:24.521]  Well, Sherman, you create your own taboo, though.
[02:16:24.601 --> 02:16:25.741]  This is all coming out.
[02:16:26.101 --> 02:16:28.162]  It's so big, they can't hide it anymore.
[02:16:28.182 --> 02:16:29.663]  You know what the problem is, Alex?
[02:16:30.543 --> 02:16:35.625]  You're not a manager of a major radio station, therefore they don't permit you to win.
[02:16:36.366 --> 02:16:38.947]  Otherwise, you wouldn't be talking to us about it.
[02:16:39.327 --> 02:16:41.768]  You would have been a winner, and you would have shut your mouth.
[02:16:43.028 --> 02:16:46.810]  Yeah, the son of the secret cell is groping through life.
[02:16:47.609 --> 02:16:54.978]  In fact, Alex, to put it in a cynical form, the fact that you're discussing it with us indicates that you tell the truth.
[02:16:55.398 --> 02:17:02.226]  Because if you were covering up for the lottery and the gambling casinos, you wouldn't be putting us loudmouths on with you.
[02:17:02.246 --> 02:17:07.772]  You or your cousin or somebody would have been chosen.
[02:17:08.579 --> 02:17:12.541]  To get one of those lottery tickets after the lottery closes down.
[02:17:12.701 --> 02:17:16.163]  Okay, guys, I want to switch into some other info and calls here.
[02:17:16.183 --> 02:17:17.184]  We've got a lot to cover.
[02:17:17.204 --> 02:17:19.085]  We've only got about 40 minutes left.
[02:17:19.685 --> 02:17:21.926]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:17:23.007 --> 02:17:25.308]  Let's talk to Leslie in Virginia.
[02:17:25.328 --> 02:17:26.309]  Leslie, thanks for holding.
[02:17:27.289 --> 02:17:28.910]  Thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[02:17:28.930 --> 02:17:36.114]  And thank you, Mr. Skolnick and Mr. Bloom, for exposing the conflicts of interest and oil interests as well.
[02:17:36.661 --> 02:17:42.225]  As both of you know, the Queen is the majority stockholder of British Petroleum, BP.
[02:17:43.066 --> 02:17:49.730]  And between the formal ceremonies of the Queen knighting Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Bush Sr.
[02:17:49.750 --> 02:17:52.252]  Which, by the way, is illegal according to the Constitution.
[02:17:52.592 --> 02:17:58.696]  Well, just last year she just knighted the former mayor of New York, Giuliani.
[02:17:58.736 --> 02:18:03.640]  But would Mr. Skolnick share the information that he has?
[02:18:04.350 --> 02:18:14.800]  In regards to the Federal Reserve and the wire transfers and the other accounts, with the joint bank accounts that the Queen has with the Bush family.
[02:18:14.820 --> 02:18:16.261]  $100 billion.
[02:18:16.301 --> 02:18:17.122]  Don't forget that.
[02:18:17.582 --> 02:18:19.203]  They've got to steal it from the U.S.
[02:18:19.264 --> 02:18:23.287]  Treasury in order to... No, no, no.
[02:18:23.327 --> 02:18:25.729]  Get those figures out.
[02:18:25.829 --> 02:18:27.551]  The joint bank accounts
[02:18:27.952 --> 02:18:31.014]  Between the Queen... Yeah, he's written the article.
[02:18:31.335 --> 02:18:33.096]  I know that, but... Let me get you to comment on it.
[02:18:33.136 --> 02:18:34.057]  Go ahead, Sherman.
[02:18:34.837 --> 02:18:56.754]  Look, I wrote a series called Greenspan Aids and Bribes Bush, and on cloakanddagger.ca is the secret Federal Reserve wire transfer authorized by Greenspan involving a $100 billion joint account between the Bush crime family and Queen Elizabeth...
[02:18:57.307 --> 02:19:03.771]  The second, in her private bank in London, Coots Bank London, and who is the third party to the deal?
[02:19:03.791 --> 02:19:05.472]  Saddam Hussein.
[02:19:06.053 --> 02:19:11.676]  And there was a case in court where I was the only journalist covering the case, okay?
[02:19:12.076 --> 02:19:13.738]  And it's mentioned on my website.
[02:19:14.258 --> 02:19:18.421]  And who was the business partner in the 80s?
[02:19:19.672 --> 02:19:22.494]  Of the Bushcrank family, Saddam Hussein.
[02:19:22.595 --> 02:19:26.998]  Yeah, well, obviously he had the second biggest oil supply, and that did come out in the BCCI scandal.
[02:19:27.078 --> 02:19:31.141]  This is documented, and it's now coming out with the Bank of England involved.
[02:19:32.702 --> 02:19:34.644]  Whoa, thanks for the call, Leslie.
[02:19:34.684 --> 02:19:39.187]  We'll come back and talk to John, David, Kevin, Ethan, and others with our guests Sherman Skullick and Lenny Bloom.
[02:19:39.307 --> 02:19:43.150]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:19:43.170 --> 02:19:43.611]  Stay with us.
[02:19:45.751 --> 02:19:48.152]  I'm glad to tell you there's an easier way to get it all at once.
[02:20:05.982 --> 02:20:07.983]  Not convinced yet?
[02:20:08.043 --> 02:20:12.127]  How about auto repair, health and beauty, financial services or shopping discounts?
[02:20:27.722 --> 02:20:28.183]  We're good to go.
[02:20:45.331 --> 02:20:49.232]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:20:49.472 --> 02:20:54.893]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:20:55.173 --> 02:21:05.536]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:21:05.696 --> 02:21:10.037]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:21:10.237 --> 02:21:18.598]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:21:18.858 --> 02:21:25.220]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and panels taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[02:21:25.340 --> 02:21:29.820]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave them the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:21:30.040 --> 02:21:34.261]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[02:21:34.621 --> 02:21:38.922]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-

[02:21:45.074 --> 02:21:49.795]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[02:21:50.035 --> 02:21:53.456]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[02:21:53.676 --> 02:21:56.157]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[02:21:56.397 --> 02:22:04.979]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[02:22:05.359 --> 02:22:11.100]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.

[02:24:02.088 --> 02:24:02.929]  All right, my friends.
[02:24:03.049 --> 02:24:04.751]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[02:24:05.793 --> 02:24:09.878]  We've got a lot of callers here I want to go to, but shifting gears yet again.
[02:24:09.918 --> 02:24:13.262]  Sherman Skolnick, Lenny Bloom, we've all talked a lot about, interviewed all the experts.
[02:24:13.703 --> 02:24:15.465]  I've made two films, written a book on the subject.
[02:24:15.966 --> 02:24:18.409]  September 11th, clearly the globalists carried that out.
[02:24:19.131 --> 02:24:19.651]  Alex, can I ask this?
[02:24:19.671 --> 02:24:21.472]  Can Lenny and I have six minutes uninterrupted?
[02:24:21.492 --> 02:24:21.692]  Yeah, sure.
[02:24:21.712 --> 02:24:24.753]  We'll do that coming up in the next segment, Sherman.
[02:24:24.793 --> 02:24:29.015]  We want to discuss briefly what the program that they took off the air tried to do in 76 weeks.
[02:24:49.224 --> 02:24:58.586]  And a quick list of the forbidden subjects so that the public will get some idea of what we have been trying to educate the public about.
[02:24:58.666 --> 02:25:03.247]  Sure, but you know when I've been on your show, I don't get six minutes uninterrupted, but that's fine.
[02:25:03.547 --> 02:25:08.468]  Well, yeah, look, Sherman, let me just say this and answer the question.
[02:25:09.168 --> 02:25:15.690]  Basically, the CIA has put America into a state of gigantic pictorial illusionism
[02:25:16.437 --> 02:25:19.178]  And journalistic exaggeration of concealment.
[02:25:19.638 --> 02:25:25.079]  They scrubbed off their minds just like the flashy thingy thing in the movie Men in Black.
[02:25:25.159 --> 02:25:27.579]  Let's deal with his question about 9-1-1, right?
[02:25:29.039 --> 02:25:43.122]  The New York Times on August 18, 2001, ran a strange story about the people that were living inside one of the World Trade Centers, of which the security originally told the New York Times there's nobody there.
[02:25:44.299 --> 02:25:50.121]  And when the tragedy happened on September 11th, they didn't refer back to their own article.
[02:25:50.261 --> 02:26:11.407]  Further, right before 9-1-1 came out the book Body of Secrets by James Bamford, where he published the secret documents how the crazies in the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1962 wanted to instigate an invasion of Cuba by blowing up American airplanes and buildings
[02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:14.642]  And killing Americans to blame on DeCastro.
[02:26:14.662 --> 02:26:15.763]  Well, I have the document.
[02:26:15.783 --> 02:26:16.664]  It's not just that book.
[02:26:17.284 --> 02:26:25.451]  I know, but the point is, 9-1-1 basically is a follow-up of that same plan 39 years later.
[02:26:26.672 --> 02:26:27.052]  Whatever.
[02:26:27.072 --> 02:26:28.253]  It's the same thing.
[02:26:28.594 --> 02:26:31.356]  How come the media didn't refer to that?
[02:26:31.376 --> 02:26:34.298]  There's no doubt that it was a shock and awe operation.
[02:26:34.338 --> 02:26:36.380]  But I'm asking, when's their next attack coming?
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:37.481]  When's their next attack?
[02:26:37.541 --> 02:26:38.822]  And the real question is this.
[02:26:39.569 --> 02:26:43.811]  The New World Order wouldn't fit into the old... No, Sherman, let me just say this.
[02:26:44.111 --> 02:26:52.255]  The New World Order, their New World Order, didn't fit into the old space unless it had some violent alterations and retailoring.
[02:26:52.695 --> 02:27:02.479]  And 9-11 is one of those alterations and retailoring that occupy most of the so-called news because they're trying to shimmy their system into place.
[02:27:03.084 --> 02:27:05.725]  And if they can shimmy it without it, they'll do it.
[02:27:05.905 --> 02:27:08.966]  Otherwise, they'll have to have some big terrorist event.
[02:27:09.226 --> 02:27:16.508]  Okay, but the point is, the next so-called attack, there has been no attack on the United States by Arabs.
[02:27:16.929 --> 02:27:19.149]  There's patsies like Lee Harvey Oswald.
[02:27:19.489 --> 02:27:24.531]  The Arabs were not directly involved with 9-1-1 except as patsies.
[02:27:24.731 --> 02:27:25.531]  I understand that.
[02:27:26.192 --> 02:27:27.212]  Well, the public doesn't.
[02:27:28.311 --> 02:27:30.813]  The public is referring to the Alex.
[02:27:30.973 --> 02:27:32.114]  Alex, let me ask you this.
[02:27:32.354 --> 02:27:39.158]  Do you think that they have to orchestrate any more shocks in order to shimmy their new system into place?
[02:27:39.558 --> 02:27:44.902]  Yes, and they were going to carry out more attacks right after, but they've been exposed, they've been put off balance.
[02:27:45.242 --> 02:27:49.105]  So many people inside government have been leaking info, going public.
[02:27:49.205 --> 02:27:50.806]  I think they're in a lot of trouble right now.
[02:27:51.847 --> 02:27:53.808]  The trouble that I foresee is,
[02:27:54.525 --> 02:27:59.666]  They may not have an election this year in the manner in which the public has been accustomed to.
[02:27:59.686 --> 02:28:02.367]  We didn't have one last time in the manner we're accustomed to.
[02:28:02.427 --> 02:28:05.067]  I predicted it two years in advance.
[02:28:05.767 --> 02:28:23.071]  And I believe that an emergency panel not provided for in the Constitution will run the government without the Constitution because of financial disaster and things along those lines.
[02:28:24.078 --> 02:28:26.099]  Of which the public is not prepared.
[02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:30.782]  The public is being misled into a fake prosperity trap.
[02:28:30.822 --> 02:28:36.785]  Well, Sherman, we have the head of NORTHCOM saying martial law, the outgoing head of CENTCOM saying martial law.
[02:28:37.837 --> 02:28:41.319]  And so they're definitely trying to prepare us for something, but they'll still just put a puppet in.
[02:28:41.359 --> 02:28:43.181]  I mean, the president's not running anything right now.
[02:28:43.701 --> 02:28:54.408]  So why would they put a, you know, I know they're getting ready for committee boards and FEMA takeovers, that's admitted, but I don't see why they'd go ahead and use that unless they want to get rid of all illusions that this is a free country.
[02:28:56.829 --> 02:29:05.835]  Alex, some of the federal courthouses are being closed to reporters, litigants, and lawyers.
[02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:08.861]  It's a forbidden subject, which I know a lot about.
[02:29:10.881 --> 02:29:13.722]  I cannot go into the federal courthouse.
[02:29:14.422 --> 02:29:22.504]  I have been, by the chief judge, ordered to be blocked from all the federal courts in the Midwest.
[02:29:22.664 --> 02:29:26.985]  It's unconstitutional, but there's no use to discuss the First Amendment.
[02:29:27.225 --> 02:29:29.005]  My First Amendment has been canceled.
[02:29:29.685 --> 02:29:31.186]  We'll be right back with your call.
[02:29:31.206 --> 02:29:31.606]  Stay with us.
[02:29:35.134 --> 02:29:36.035]  We're on the march.
[02:29:36.535 --> 02:29:38.136]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:39.077 --> 02:29:41.739]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:45.726 --> 02:29:50.390]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the first ever half-price package sale at the Ark Institute.

[02:30:36.576 --> 02:30:41.897]  That's 800-255-1912 or send a money order for $69 to the ARC Institute, P.O.
[02:30:41.957 --> 02:30:44.838]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[02:30:45.898 --> 02:30:47.398]  Be a part of the new gold rush.
[02:30:47.858 --> 02:30:52.159]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[02:30:52.559 --> 02:30:53.459]  It still is.
[02:30:54.059 --> 02:30:57.540]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[02:30:57.880 --> 02:30:59.680]  You know the old saying, good is gold?
[02:31:00.241 --> 02:31:02.281]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[02:31:02.850 --> 02:31:04.871]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[02:31:05.272 --> 02:31:12.917]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[02:31:13.297 --> 02:31:17.080]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.
[02:31:17.760 --> 02:31:22.724]  Call this toll-free number for your free investing in precious metals kit.
[02:31:23.024 --> 02:31:25.465]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:31:25.866 --> 02:31:30.469]  For the complete story, the highest quality precious metals, call Midas Resources.

[02:31:39.805 --> 02:31:40.366]  Call today, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:31:45.436 --> 02:31:51.722]  Maca is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[02:31:52.103 --> 02:31:56.187]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[02:31:56.687 --> 02:32:03.895]  Only recently has science discovered that maca is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[02:32:04.435 --> 02:32:11.778]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels.
[02:32:12.138 --> 02:32:21.541]  Increased libido, which helps prevent impotence, relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort, helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and night sweats.
[02:32:21.822 --> 02:32:24.823]  It also helps prevent osteoporosis and joint pain.
[02:32:25.223 --> 02:32:33.326]  Get your maca from Cliff Scott Enterprises at a price and quality that few can match because we get our maca fresh from the growers in Peru.
[02:32:33.886 --> 02:32:34.626]  All right, folks.
[02:32:34.887 --> 02:32:36.727]  I know a lot of this sounds crazy.
[02:32:58.766 --> 02:33:08.350]  Out of control, but if you look at history, what governments do, what powerful people do, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, and those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[02:33:08.880 --> 02:33:12.503]  We're about to go to John and David and Kevin and Ethan and Mark.
[02:33:12.923 --> 02:33:14.024]  That'll be it for calls.
[02:33:14.044 --> 02:33:15.025]  That's all we have time for.
[02:33:15.085 --> 02:33:23.631]  But I want to give some time to Sherman, who wants to talk about some of these forbidden subjects, which actually involve them coming out now.
[02:33:23.711 --> 02:33:26.994]  But they put it in the back of the paper like it's no big deal.
[02:33:27.494 --> 02:33:32.318]  I find that to be the new propaganda tactic, is to just throw it out there and just say, go ahead and accept it.
[02:33:32.878 --> 02:33:33.939]  But go ahead, Sherman.
[02:33:34.580 --> 02:33:35.961]  Lenny has got something to say.
[02:33:36.821 --> 02:33:38.362]  As the moderator of our program.
[02:33:38.382 --> 02:33:39.042]  Go ahead, Lenny.
[02:33:39.142 --> 02:34:04.015]  Yeah, I think that the term cloak and dagger epitomizes exactly what it is that Sherman and all of us are saying is the modus operandi of the powers that be is a cloak and dagger operation where they basically hide behind a complex smoke and mirror machine that maintains their bread and circus shows.
[02:34:04.693 --> 02:34:10.558]  And that's certainly what you've really been on and doing a great job bringing out yourself, Alex.
[02:34:10.799 --> 02:34:11.679]  A tremendous job.
[02:34:11.699 --> 02:34:12.600]  You're to be commended.
[02:34:12.961 --> 02:34:14.502]  Just a fantastic job.
[02:34:14.522 --> 02:34:18.306]  Well, folks should go to cloakanddagger.ca.
[02:34:19.046 --> 02:34:23.771]  Our website, let me just give it again, is www.cloakanddagger.ca.
[02:34:24.351 --> 02:34:26.053]  And our mirror site is...
[02:34:27.987 --> 02:34:33.909]  TheMediaNews.com, and that's sort of a mirror site in case they hit cloak and dagger too hard.
[02:34:34.349 --> 02:34:39.591]  You can always go to TheMediaNews.com, but I just wanted to throw that out there.
[02:34:39.711 --> 02:34:41.552]  We used to have some good times, Alex.
[02:34:41.932 --> 02:34:46.834]  I think it's important to learn to play with the subject and having different songs as we did.
[02:34:47.194 --> 02:34:53.556]  The Illuminati song and the Spine songs is a great way of breaking the ice and furthering exploration.
[02:34:53.636 --> 02:34:55.957]  Okay, for those that just joined us, I'd like to say something.
[02:34:56.558 --> 02:34:57.618]  For those that just joined us,
[02:34:58.462 --> 02:35:00.903]  Again, I've been on the show probably 10, 15 times.
[02:35:00.943 --> 02:35:03.223]  I didn't count it up on your Cloak & Dagger show.
[02:35:03.243 --> 02:35:10.125]  It got the highest ratings in that time slot there in Toronto, and then you guys just got canned.
[02:35:10.585 --> 02:35:15.026]  And this is something I've experienced six and a half years ago here in Austin when my show was number one.
[02:35:15.066 --> 02:35:17.147]  They said, stop talking about the New World Order.
[02:35:17.187 --> 02:35:19.347]  So this is another example of censorship.
[02:35:19.587 --> 02:35:20.608]  Go ahead, Sherman.
[02:35:22.468 --> 02:35:25.849]  What I wanted to say, I'll be brief, because we want to get to the calls, but
[02:35:27.023 --> 02:35:35.170]  In the 76 weeks, we dealt as if we were running a seminar on a forbidden subject.
[02:35:35.710 --> 02:35:41.615]  In North America, no colleges or universities that I know of teaches about the aristocracy.
[02:35:42.456 --> 02:35:47.560]  In fact, they come out after years of education not even knowing how to spell aristocracy.
[02:35:48.141 --> 02:35:54.166]  On Lenny's program, Cloak and Dagger, we discussed the aristocracy, the crown heads of Europe,
[02:35:54.967 --> 02:35:57.808]  And what they have been into.
[02:35:57.908 --> 02:36:11.933]  For example, the Jesuits and the British royalty end of the aristocracy benefited, now get this, from the assassination of seven U.S.
[02:36:12.093 --> 02:36:12.693]  presidents.
[02:36:13.534 --> 02:36:15.895]  I know that comes as a shock to some people.
[02:36:16.255 --> 02:36:18.516]  Well, they were all killed by lone assassins.
[02:36:18.656 --> 02:36:19.116]  Good.
[02:36:20.816 --> 02:36:22.517]  Stuff like that we discussed earlier.
[02:36:23.135 --> 02:36:24.036]  I think we're good.
[02:36:40.803 --> 02:36:41.564]  Yes, I think so.
[02:37:06.391 --> 02:37:09.834]  Specifically, some of the forbidden subjects.
[02:37:10.114 --> 02:37:12.756]  Lenny, fill in a couple more of the forbidden subjects.
[02:37:12.816 --> 02:37:14.457]  Von Buelow, you were going to mention that.
[02:37:14.797 --> 02:37:16.719]  Yeah, Von Buelow.
[02:37:16.739 --> 02:37:18.460]  The holograms, go into it, Lenny.
[02:37:19.881 --> 02:37:30.589]  Alex, there's an interesting development that really is this whole development that came out of the scientists that we spoke to who worked on hologram development.
[02:37:30.649 --> 02:37:32.551]  And it all started in 1973 with the Yom Kippur War.
[02:37:34.642 --> 02:37:49.430]  Because with the suitcase tool missiles that were 100% accurate and 100% idiot proof, you could give it to anybody with a kindergarten education, and it was 100% accurate and knocked out their tanks.
[02:37:50.210 --> 02:37:55.073]  In order to develop and keep the tank warfare, they started to develop the holograms.
[02:37:56.024 --> 02:38:05.587]  And the hologram technology, so that when one tank goes out into the field, there's a satellite overhead, and now there's 16 tanks surrounding it.
[02:38:06.087 --> 02:38:21.692]  And the technology, the hologram, just has been kept from people so that they could run a tank right up your street, and if you looked out your bathroom window, you'd swear it was a tank, unless you walked out there, and then you'd find that it just was a light illusion, a trick of the light.
[02:38:23.030 --> 02:38:24.050]  Well, they admit.
[02:38:24.110 --> 02:38:31.373]  I mean, that's even on the Discovery Channel that the Pentagon can project Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad, whatever they want up into the night sky.
[02:38:31.413 --> 02:38:35.034]  And we got reports that in Iraq that stuff was used in the first Gulf War.
[02:38:35.174 --> 02:38:39.075]  And they can even project airplanes that appear to go into a building and not...
[02:38:44.077 --> 02:38:45.877]  To fly into a building.
[02:38:47.798 --> 02:38:50.779]  You know, I've seen that, but guys, hold on just a second.
[02:38:51.219 --> 02:38:52.039]  See, that's the problem.
[02:38:52.639 --> 02:38:54.600]  We talk about covering things we can prove.
[02:38:54.640 --> 02:38:56.540]  Well, I don't say that's the case.
[02:38:56.600 --> 02:38:57.780]  I know they blew the buildings up.
[02:38:58.661 --> 02:39:00.921]  Hold on just a second, guys.
[02:39:01.321 --> 02:39:01.741]  Just a second.
[02:39:02.822 --> 02:39:11.404]  I know that the major Spanish newspaper, and I've got it on the website right now, has had top experts look at the belly attachment on one of the planes.
[02:39:11.484 --> 02:39:12.584]  It had been modified.
[02:39:13.524 --> 02:39:16.406]  It did have a large pod on the bottom.
[02:39:17.307 --> 02:39:18.988]  There are a lot of weird things.
[02:39:19.008 --> 02:39:20.429]  No black boxes.
[02:39:21.490 --> 02:39:27.594]  Makes turns that only a projected image in the sky, like the bat symbol, would be able to do.
[02:39:28.294 --> 02:39:35.359]  Well, the pilots have said that one of the planes pulled 6.5 Gs, which the planes are designed with their systems.
[02:39:35.399 --> 02:39:38.261]  They cannot fly unless it was under remote control.
[02:39:38.421 --> 02:39:42.744]  The plane was like a folded-up napkin and went through a hole,
[02:39:43.214 --> 02:39:47.936]  And the wings didn't fall off or anything?
[02:39:47.956 --> 02:39:55.439]  The wings didn't fall off and nothing happened that was supposed to happen because physically the plane cannot fly into a building.
[02:39:56.499 --> 02:39:57.760]  It's a joke.
[02:39:57.900 --> 02:40:02.101]  They've told America that a little piece of glass... Yeah, but guys, you talk about documenting everything.
[02:40:02.121 --> 02:40:04.262]  98% of what you've been saying I can prove.
[02:40:04.302 --> 02:40:06.083]  It's speculation.
[02:40:06.663 --> 02:40:11.205]  The reason they took that pane of glass off, Sherman, the reason they took the pane of glass off
[02:40:11.696 --> 02:40:20.180]  And put a balcony out there was, of course, to do the necessary laser... And I have seen that New York... Just stop, just stop, just stop, just stop.
[02:40:21.260 --> 02:40:33.605]  You know, I have seen the New York Times article where there was this weird group of Germans up there in one of the buildings, and they did paint a glass off and put this balcony out there, but again, that's not proof.
[02:40:34.726 --> 02:40:40.468]  Alex, to take a pane of glass off a building which is that huge...
[02:40:41.957 --> 02:40:48.811]  Is something that you just don't do lightly because of what it... But let me talk about the documentation.
[02:40:49.212 --> 02:40:50.715]  What about the fire department tapes?
[02:40:50.755 --> 02:40:52.338]  The top people in the fire department...
[02:40:52.765 --> 02:40:54.326]  We're high up in the building.
[02:40:54.346 --> 02:40:55.947]  They said there isn't much of a fire.
[02:40:56.308 --> 02:40:57.328]  Bring up the hoses.
[02:40:57.689 --> 02:40:58.629]  We can control it.
[02:40:58.649 --> 02:41:00.150]  The fire isn't going anyplace.
[02:41:00.470 --> 02:41:01.471]  Don't you see the point?
[02:41:02.152 --> 02:41:09.537]  The internal explosives were set to detonate as the hologramic image met and went into the building.
[02:41:09.597 --> 02:41:12.439]  But if it had been a real plane, it would have pancaked on the outside.
[02:41:13.159 --> 02:41:15.461]  Okay, I've got to stop you right there.
[02:41:15.781 --> 02:41:24.627]  Again, clearly there were bombs, clearly the seismographs, the firefighters, but the firefighters saying the fires were almost gone, I mean, that's what jet fuel would do.
[02:41:24.667 --> 02:41:25.607]  That's what a plane would do.
[02:41:25.667 --> 02:41:26.348]  It would go out.
[02:41:26.828 --> 02:41:32.632]  So, again, guys, you know, I don't believe that that's what happened.
[02:41:33.812 --> 02:41:41.217]  And I know they have these technologies, but it's not an area I get into because I can't prove it.
[02:41:41.713 --> 02:41:43.874]  And, you know, that's always been important to do that.
[02:41:45.996 --> 02:41:49.138]  Again, I mean, there's all other, you know, sorts of things being reported out there.
[02:41:49.178 --> 02:41:56.322]  You saw Silverstein's statement that he had to pull the building, as he said, regarding Trade Center No.
[02:41:56.342 --> 02:41:56.322]  7.
[02:41:56.442 --> 02:41:58.604]  Yeah, I'll put that story out, sure.
[02:41:58.624 --> 02:42:05.508]  But, Alex, you're familiar with Operation Pearl, that 9-11 was not a surprise attack to the American government.
[02:42:05.568 --> 02:42:08.290]  It was only a surprise attack to the American people.
[02:42:08.925 --> 02:42:09.946]  Well, we know all that.
[02:42:10.206 --> 02:42:11.406]  Hold on, guys.
[02:42:11.526 --> 02:42:11.927]  Hold on.
[02:42:12.507 --> 02:42:14.188]  All that other stuff's proven and admitted.
[02:42:14.408 --> 02:42:18.410]  Then you add something on there, and it just turns into a spoiler because you can't prove that.
[02:42:20.752 --> 02:42:22.112]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[02:42:22.833 --> 02:42:24.194]  Sure we understand what you're saying.
[02:42:25.734 --> 02:42:35.420]  Lenny showed on his website that the plane pulled it up like a napkin and went through a hole in the building, and that's physically not possible.
[02:42:36.092 --> 02:42:38.033]  For an aluminum plane to do that.
[02:42:38.153 --> 02:42:46.877]  Well, the size of the hole left, they show you the plane going into the building completely intact.
[02:42:47.718 --> 02:42:59.563]  And physically, in actuality, if you look at a real computer model simulation, the aftershock of the nose instantaneously hitting the building reverberates and breaks off the tail.
[02:43:00.143 --> 02:43:02.745]  So it can't go intact into a building.
[02:43:03.025 --> 02:43:05.306]  So somebody's creating some trick of the like.
[02:43:06.087 --> 02:43:07.368]  Okay, well, again, I can't prove it.
[02:43:07.848 --> 02:43:09.969]  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[02:43:10.570 --> 02:43:11.830]  Guys, this is out of control.
[02:43:12.311 --> 02:43:13.892]  Let's just take some calls, as promised.
[02:43:14.512 --> 02:43:19.135]  Let's go ahead and talk to, oh, I guess John in Ohio.
[02:43:19.175 --> 02:43:19.815]  Go ahead, John.
[02:43:21.596 --> 02:43:33.623]  Yes, I wanted to discuss a couple case histories of the forbidden subjects, and I was just reading an article in isreview.org magazine.
[02:43:34.173 --> 02:43:48.626]  And they were pointing out that many of the people, these fascist neocons in the Bush administration, not only have found a home in the Reagan administration when they were instigating and supporting these death squads in Central America... Hold on a minute.
[02:43:48.666 --> 02:43:50.187]  Somebody's heavy breathing on the phone.
[02:43:50.327 --> 02:43:50.908]  Stop, please.
[02:43:51.088 --> 02:43:51.648]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:43:52.249 --> 02:44:01.197]  But their original home was in the Cold War-mongering faction of the Democratic Party when they worked for the Scoop Jackson...
[02:44:02.224 --> 02:44:05.707]  Senator for Boeing, the military industrial faction of the Democratic Party.
[02:44:06.087 --> 02:44:17.016]  And one of the people was Paul Mitzi, the former Undersecretary of Defense, who was one of the key orchestrators of Project Northwoods way back in the 60s.
[02:44:17.156 --> 02:44:18.817]  Of course, he passed on.
[02:44:18.857 --> 02:44:23.301]  He'd probably end up in the Bush II administration if he hadn't.
[02:44:23.361 --> 02:44:29.806]  But many of these people originally came from that section in the Democratic Party and beyond that.
[02:44:31.034 --> 02:44:49.667]  The role of the Central Intelligence Agency in the media was brought out by Carl Brinstein of the Washington Post, but he couldn't get it written in his own Washington Post because, of course, he indicted all of the media, including the Washington Post, the New York Times, all of the networks, Time Newsweek, as having collaborated.
[02:44:49.707 --> 02:44:53.690]  Yeah, and you've got Jane Graham in there and the Bilderberg Group and now her son.
[02:44:54.430 --> 02:44:56.472]  Go ahead, gentlemen, any comments on what John just said?
[02:44:58.513 --> 02:44:59.154]  Go ahead, Chairman.
[02:44:59.474 --> 02:45:05.464]  Well, how come the media didn't discuss the Northwood thing that came out in that book right before 9-1-1?
[02:45:06.866 --> 02:45:12.751]  When you look at the Northwood thing, you change a few words and a few dates, it's the same thing that happened in 9-1-1.
[02:45:12.791 --> 02:45:13.531]  That's my point.
[02:45:13.591 --> 02:45:24.580]  My point is that the very architect of that, Paul Mitzi, back in the 60s, was one of these neocons who worked with all of these people who have now ended up in the Bush administration.
[02:45:24.600 --> 02:45:24.780]  Nietzsche.
[02:45:24.960 --> 02:45:26.121]  It was Nietzsche, right?
[02:45:26.181 --> 02:45:26.882]  There we go.
[02:45:26.902 --> 02:45:27.602]  Paul Mitzi.
[02:45:28.063 --> 02:45:28.703]  Paul Mitzi.
[02:45:28.763 --> 02:45:30.224]  Yeah, thanks for the call.
[02:45:30.945 --> 02:45:32.386]  Alex, is there time to discuss...
[02:45:32.901 --> 02:45:37.744]  These warmongers that have the major talk show situations?
[02:45:39.545 --> 02:45:40.986]  Well, we've looked at the numbers.
[02:45:41.427 --> 02:45:46.090]  You've got a limbaugh getting paid $287 million, and there's not that much profit in the show.
[02:45:46.170 --> 02:45:51.834]  And we've talked about how the media is subsidized by the government, other public service announcements and other things.
[02:45:51.894 --> 02:45:52.654]  But sure, go ahead.
[02:45:54.495 --> 02:46:00.079]  From my years of experience, the way I analyze it is with arithmetic and details.
[02:46:00.638 --> 02:46:21.576]  I find out how much it costs for a 30-second ad, how much is the estimated amount that Sean Hannity and Russ Limbaugh get, and when you do that, you find out he does not have that many good ads to warrant the amount per week that each of them gets, and therefore you know there is some secret subsidy out there.
[02:46:21.656 --> 02:46:23.337]  Well, let me give folks an example of this.
[02:46:23.357 --> 02:46:26.640]  They have a thing called Austin Air Force here in Austin.
[02:46:26.660 --> 02:46:27.701]  They have them all over the country.
[02:46:27.741 --> 02:46:28.882]  It's a private group.
[02:46:29.640 --> 02:46:30.520]  Isn't it just Pentagon Subsidy?
[02:46:54.423 --> 02:46:54.863]  Well, yes.
[02:46:55.123 --> 02:46:57.865]  And this, you see, guys, I mean, what you're saying is true.
[02:46:57.905 --> 02:46:58.585]  It's documented.
[02:46:58.605 --> 02:47:01.367]  I mean, I agree with 99, 98% of what you're saying.
[02:47:01.647 --> 02:47:03.228]  I just can't get into areas I can't prove.
[02:47:03.268 --> 02:47:03.908]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:47:05.149 --> 02:47:07.610]  Well, the point is the numbers don't add up.
[02:47:08.131 --> 02:47:23.239]  And those that are warmongers that want the American aristocracy to lash out like Hitler against Syria, against Lebanon, whatever it is, to take us away from the Bill of Rights,
[02:47:23.777 --> 02:47:27.440]  And to become an aggressive dictatorial country.
[02:47:27.460 --> 02:47:28.341]  Alex.
[02:47:29.862 --> 02:47:36.267]  And those that are for warmongering, they get the major positions on these major blowtorch stations.
[02:47:36.367 --> 02:47:36.788]  Absolutely.
[02:47:36.828 --> 02:47:37.768]  Let's go ahead and talk.
[02:47:37.789 --> 02:47:41.451]  Alex, before we go, one thing to add is this.
[02:47:41.572 --> 02:47:47.797]  Just remember that what we're always following is this Pentagon TV station, CNN,
[02:47:48.712 --> 02:47:57.814]  Or will this week, and is always going to continue to disseminate more fashion speak to fulfill the public's artificially induced appetites?
[02:47:58.174 --> 02:47:58.614]  Absolutely.
[02:47:58.654 --> 02:47:59.414]  Let's take a call.
[02:48:00.014 --> 02:48:03.555]  And then they call themselves liberal, and none of it's liberal.
[02:48:03.615 --> 02:48:05.015]  It's military-industrial complex.
[02:48:05.615 --> 02:48:06.815]  David in Missouri, go ahead.
[02:48:06.835 --> 02:48:07.395]  You're on the air.
[02:48:10.276 --> 02:48:11.796]  David, you're on the air.
[02:48:12.116 --> 02:48:16.637]  Yes, I was wondering if the three of you could discuss the Tavistock Institute.
[02:48:17.839 --> 02:48:19.660]  That's the big British mind control arm.
[02:48:19.700 --> 02:48:20.541]  Yeah, go ahead, guys.
[02:48:22.302 --> 02:48:27.625]  Well, Crawler, you're bringing up broad subjects into a limited forum.
[02:48:27.805 --> 02:48:35.210]  Well, let's just say very quickly, Sherman, Tavistock certainly had a part in the Beatles as a major military operation.
[02:48:35.550 --> 02:48:43.455]  They brought it in in 1964 to keep the war... By the way, the Beatles came to divert attention from the assassination of President Kennedy.
[02:48:43.874 --> 02:48:50.897]  They reached their height in popularity at the time the infamous Warren Commission report came out in September 64.
[02:48:51.017 --> 02:49:00.641]  Yeah, they used the Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, all these media blitzes to captivate everybody off of real issues.
[02:49:00.681 --> 02:49:03.582]  They did what Vince McMahon is doing now with world wrestling.
[02:49:03.622 --> 02:49:09.605]  They created a profile, a character, hired record companies, and said, go out and find the guys to do this for us.
[02:49:09.825 --> 02:49:10.785]  Okay, go ahead, David.
[02:49:10.805 --> 02:49:11.445]  I can do that.
[02:49:14.028 --> 02:49:15.369]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[02:49:15.449 --> 02:49:16.710]  Let's talk to Kevin and Mash.
[02:49:16.750 --> 02:49:17.530]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[02:49:17.570 --> 02:49:18.071]  Go ahead.
[02:49:20.712 --> 02:49:21.473]  Okay, Kevin's gone.
[02:49:21.493 --> 02:49:22.974]  Let's talk to Ethan in Kentucky.
[02:49:23.054 --> 02:49:23.814]  Ethan, you're on the air.
[02:49:23.854 --> 02:49:24.335]  Go ahead.
[02:49:26.016 --> 02:49:27.937]  Okay, let me just get my steel and then I'll be gone.
[02:49:27.957 --> 02:49:37.283]  I just want to say that I'm outraged that our president and his illicit administration of tycoons gave terrorists Pakistan $3 billion of our tax money solely for military purposes.
[02:49:37.628 --> 02:49:47.852]  Yeah, let's boil that down.
[02:49:47.912 --> 02:49:54.414]  Our government arms China, arms North Korea, arms Pakistan, proliferates the weapons, and then says we've got to invade all these countries to keep us safe.
[02:49:54.614 --> 02:49:58.336]  Yeah, and the mainstream media won't even give this issue three minutes of coverage.
[02:49:58.436 --> 02:50:05.739]  This should be the number one story that our own president is an enemy combatant and a funder of terror.
[02:50:06.079 --> 02:50:06.879]  And no one believes it.
[02:50:07.768 --> 02:50:12.912]  And everyone just grubs down on the bold-faced lies that our oligarchy is spoon-feeding us.
[02:50:13.473 --> 02:50:13.973]  Absolutely.
[02:50:14.013 --> 02:50:15.434]  Thanks for the call, Ethan.
[02:50:15.995 --> 02:50:19.318]  Sherman Skolnick, Lenny Bloom, I'll have to get you both back on the show.
[02:50:19.338 --> 02:50:20.138]  We've got more time.
[02:50:20.178 --> 02:50:21.039]  It's not so wild.
[02:50:21.059 --> 02:50:22.180]  I know it's frustrating.
[02:50:22.200 --> 02:50:23.541]  We need to get a lot more info out.
[02:50:23.961 --> 02:50:24.942]  We're out of time, gentlemen.
[02:50:24.962 --> 02:50:28.445]  I'm going to come back and hit a final couple news stories, the one the caller just mentioned.
[02:50:29.046 --> 02:50:31.328]  And I want to thank you both for coming on the show.
[02:50:31.388 --> 02:50:35.631]  CloakandDagger.ca or SkolnickReport.com.
[02:50:35.691 --> 02:50:36.632]  Thank you both, gentlemen.
[02:50:37.808 --> 02:50:38.288]  Take care.
[02:50:38.849 --> 02:50:39.930]  All right, I'll be back.
[02:50:40.070 --> 02:50:41.351]  Boy, strap yourselves in.
[02:50:41.371 --> 02:50:42.552]  This has been a wild show.
[02:50:42.572 --> 02:50:42.992]  Stay with us.

[02:52:21.096 --> 02:52:24.980]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:52:25.040 --> 02:52:26.921]  The water level is always visible.
[02:52:27.122 --> 02:52:33.047]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:52:33.307 --> 02:52:37.251]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:52:37.271 --> 02:52:37.831]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:52:46.038 --> 02:52:50.381]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:52:50.581 --> 02:52:55.004]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:52:55.164 --> 02:52:59.527]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:52:59.647 --> 02:53:00.928]  A New World Order.
[02:53:02.709 --> 02:53:06.932]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:53:06.992 --> 02:53:13.916]  We've ripped the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and revealed the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:53:14.056 --> 02:53:16.118]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:53:16.378 --> 02:53:26.845]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:53:27.065 --> 02:53:28.746]  If you want to understand what the new world order represents,
[02:53:28.786 --> 02:53:30.988]  That's 888-253-3139 Order today and spread the word.
[02:53:49.207 --> 02:53:49.728]  Don't worry.
[02:53:50.168 --> 02:53:51.689]  This show is documented.
[02:53:52.210 --> 02:53:54.993]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:53:55.393 --> 02:53:58.916]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:53:59.317 --> 02:54:03.320]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went hard.
[02:54:03.921 --> 02:54:07.444]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[02:54:07.484 --> 02:54:09.046]  Well, that was a very interesting interview.
[02:54:12.228 --> 02:54:15.470]  Boy, there's so much to cover, running out of time there.
[02:54:16.391 --> 02:54:17.892]  Some really scary news.
[02:54:17.972 --> 02:54:25.798]  When you register a website, you have to have your address and phone number in the pass for your business.
[02:54:28.199 --> 02:54:31.522]  And you can lose your website if that address isn't correct.
[02:54:33.603 --> 02:54:39.888]  Well, you talk about the government trying to make laws where we're all caught in the net, where people that weren't criminals are.
[02:54:40.700 --> 02:54:45.982]  Seven years in jail, $150,000 fine if you don't tell the world your email and home address.
[02:54:47.002 --> 02:54:48.222]  Well, a phone number, I would add.
[02:54:49.303 --> 02:54:54.264]  And it says, this is out of the register, it's on infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.
[02:54:54.284 --> 02:55:01.786]  If you don't tell the world your email, home address, and telephone number, you could face a seven-year jail sentence, $150,000 fine under new legislation that the U.S.
[02:55:01.826 --> 02:55:04.587]  Congress is trying to push past today.
[02:55:05.464 --> 02:55:22.409]  Senator Lamar Smith, a fake conservative of Texas, chairman of the courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee yesterday, produced from nowhere extensions to the 1946 Trademark Act that would make giving false contact information for a domain name a civil and criminal offense.
[02:55:24.550 --> 02:55:26.191]  And the bill is H.R.
[02:55:26.211 --> 02:55:26.191]  3754.
[02:55:27.351 --> 02:55:33.853]  And you move, and you forget to change that address on there, or there's a letter or a number wrong in it, seven years in prison,
[02:55:35.473 --> 02:55:35.774]  $150,000 fine.
[02:55:36.014 --> 02:55:39.218]  And it's actually covered under terror sections.
[02:55:39.358 --> 02:55:44.104]  So, sending an email to the wrong person, life in prison, they're trying to pass that.
[02:55:44.144 --> 02:55:45.206]  I mean, this sounds insane.
[02:55:45.286 --> 02:55:46.007]  It is insane.
[02:55:46.067 --> 02:55:46.607]  It's happening.
[02:55:48.250 --> 02:55:51.313]  So, make sure that's right out there, folks, for your websites.
[02:55:51.674 --> 02:55:53.196]  Try to stop this bill from passing.
[02:55:54.297 --> 02:56:01.982]  The nuclear supermarket, and this is the London Telegraph, and it's what the caller was just talking about, and I'll talk more about this on Monday, obviously.
[02:56:02.002 --> 02:56:03.603]  I need to talk more about this.
[02:56:04.003 --> 02:56:13.749]  Intelligence agencies and nuclear inspectors are racing to close a vast international nuclear supermarket that has secretly supplied Iran, Libya, North Korea, and perhaps several other countries for more than a decade.
[02:56:14.389 --> 02:56:18.271]  And their buddy, General Musharraf, who runs Pakistan, U.S.
[02:56:18.311 --> 02:56:19.872]  companies gave it all to him publicly.
[02:56:19.912 --> 02:56:22.193]  They've given it to North Korea publicly.
[02:56:24.770 --> 02:56:27.732]  Rumsfeld, the board of ABB, gave the reactors to North Korea.
[02:56:28.052 --> 02:56:32.496]  They arm these people, and then they arm everybody else, and that's not a problem.
[02:56:32.536 --> 02:56:33.356]  They're our little buddies.
[02:56:33.376 --> 02:56:37.199]  Now we're going to have to attack all the countries they may have sold something to.
[02:56:38.520 --> 02:56:41.642]  I mean, this is so, it's like our government giving the Soviets everything.
[02:56:41.882 --> 02:56:45.725]  Our submarines, our nuke secrets, our missile systems, they give it all to them.
[02:56:46.918 --> 02:56:53.080]  And it's the same old thing, and they're lining up the National Draft, getting ready for this war to attack 62 more countries.
[02:56:53.400 --> 02:56:55.001]  That's public, the PNAC documents.
[02:56:55.841 --> 02:57:03.983]  Also, a story here, German RFID scandal, hidden devices, unthinkable tags, unkillable tags found in Metro furniture store.
[02:57:04.043 --> 02:57:07.885]  Germans say, nigh, we won't be your slaves.
[02:57:08.865 --> 02:57:15.067]  And, I mean, these microchips are going in everything, folks, and the average person has no idea this is even going on.
[02:57:16.374 --> 02:57:17.155]  I'm out of time.
[02:57:17.255 --> 02:57:22.298]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central, back on Monday, 11 to 2, and then back again from 9 to midnight.
[02:57:22.678 --> 02:57:24.039]  Please get my videos.
[02:57:24.059 --> 02:57:25.040]  They're all documented.
[02:57:25.100 --> 02:57:26.161]  None of it's speculation.
[02:57:26.201 --> 02:57:26.861]  None of it's rumor.
[02:57:26.921 --> 02:57:32.325]  It's all documented fact of who's carrying out the terror, who's taking your rights, and how to fight back against them.
[02:57:32.785 --> 02:57:40.510]  Police State 3 Total Enslavement, Masters of Terror, 9-11 Road to Tyranny, Matrix of Evil, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:57:40.991 --> 02:57:42.512]  They're all over two hours long.
[02:57:43.853 --> 02:57:44.954]  $25.95 a piece.
[02:57:44.974 --> 02:57:46.915]  $20 when you order three or more.
[02:57:47.076 --> 02:57:47.496]  My book's $12.
[02:57:47.816 --> 02:57:50.338]  Paul Watson's great book's $19.95.
[02:57:50.979 --> 02:57:56.423]  Go to the websites, get the films, the books, spread the word, wake America and the world up.
[02:57:57.144 --> 02:57:58.085]  Toll-free number to order?
[02:57:58.976 --> 02:58:03.097]  The videos, or the books, or the t-shirts, the bumper stickers, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:58:03.117 --> 02:58:04.938]  Make the call, folks.
[02:58:04.958 --> 02:58:05.058]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:58:05.358 --> 02:58:09.459]  Or just write to me, I'm Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-0408.
[02:58:25.689 --> 02:58:31.519]  Again, my friends, it's up to us to spread the word to discredit this corrupt system that's destroying our country.
[02:58:31.559 --> 02:58:32.922]  This is an illegitimate government.
[02:58:32.962 --> 02:58:34.024]  It must be removed.
[02:58:37.631 --> 02:58:42.133]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:58:42.473 --> 02:58:46.575]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:58:46.855 --> 02:58:47.416]  We listened.
[02:58:47.716 --> 02:58:52.698]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:58:52.978 --> 02:58:53.458]  We listened.
[02:58:53.838 --> 02:58:56.880]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:58:57.320 --> 02:58:57.840]  We listened.
[02:58:58.321 --> 02:59:01.442]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[02:59:01.702 --> 02:59:02.263]  We're good to go.
[02:59:28.214 --> 02:59:29.156]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[02:59:29.176 --> 02:59:30.780]  Not yet available in Iowa.
