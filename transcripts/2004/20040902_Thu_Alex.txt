[00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:06.507]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.188 --> 00:00:08.229]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.051]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.712 --> 00:00:11.532]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.293 --> 00:00:13.194]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.855 --> 00:00:17.499]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.104]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.432 --> 00:00:25.893]  Good morning, America!
[00:00:25.913 --> 00:00:27.033]  Good afternoon, America!
[00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:30.255]  This is Erskine sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.335 --> 00:00:31.595]  Not that I can sit in for him.
[00:00:31.715 --> 00:00:33.096]  I'm guest hosting.
[00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:37.178]  And I want to thank him for the honor and the privilege of being here.
[00:00:37.998 --> 00:00:45.001]  Today, we have a program for you that's going to feature Paul Joseph Watson, author of Order Out of Chaos.
[00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:50.864]  If there's one book, one book you need to get, it's Order Out of Chaos by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:00:51.562 --> 00:00:52.102]  Fabulous!
[00:00:52.203 --> 00:00:58.047]  It tells exactly what's going on, what led up to today, and where we're headed.
[00:00:58.687 --> 00:01:03.991]  Also, Alex Jones will be joining us with reports on the Republican National Convention.
[00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:07.933]  And of course, Alex is talking about what's going on there.
[00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.395]  Up to 1,500 arrested.
[00:01:10.415 --> 00:01:14.538]  They're throwing plastic nets over what they call anarchists.
[00:01:15.248 --> 00:01:22.413]  Yeah, anarchists who happen to be newspaper and television and radio reporters, among others.
[00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:31.859]  Tourists who happen to be in New York are caught in the net and they're being taken to an old bus station, Pier 57, where they're being processed.
[00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:37.243]  Some of them stay as long as 18 hours sleeping on the floor, which is oil stained.
[00:01:38.203 --> 00:01:40.525]  And that's going on in America today.
[00:01:40.565 --> 00:01:48.892]  They're calling it Guantanamo Bay-styled holding pins, according to Andrew Lin, and widespread police abuse.
[00:01:50.564 --> 00:01:52.586]  All of that will be on the program.
[00:01:52.626 --> 00:01:56.509]  Plus, a gentleman who ran for President of the United States.
[00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:58.490]  You know he can't be absolutely normal.
[00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.472]  I mean, anybody who'd run for President's got to be a little askew.
[00:02:02.053 --> 00:02:03.254]  But that's Harry Brown.
[00:02:03.314 --> 00:02:05.676]  He ran twice on the Libertarian ticket.
[00:02:06.056 --> 00:02:12.481]  He's going to tell us what it's like to run for President of the United States and why the third parties aren't mentioned anywhere.
[00:02:13.241 --> 00:02:13.822]  But first,
[00:02:14.525 --> 00:02:25.550]  For 10 years Alex Jones has been telling you in video, he's been telling you in books, he's been telling you on radio what's coming to America.
[00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:43.998]  He has been the Paul Revere leading what is happening in America and now he's displayed the Texas National Guard manual for infrastructure protection which was delivered to him by an insider within that program on his public television access show and
[00:02:44.927 --> 00:02:51.012]  According to the manual, they are going to be deploying troops November 1st.
[00:02:51.072 --> 00:02:56.076]  It goes into detail on the military takeover of civic authorities, city halls, etc.
[00:02:56.597 --> 00:03:01.160]  It's exactly what Alex has been telling America for the last 10 years.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.241]  Is this coming?
[00:03:02.922 --> 00:03:08.746]  Well, according to the Texas National Guard manual, you bet it is coming.
[00:03:09.847 --> 00:03:14.291]  Lots and lots of step-ups of Customs Enforcement on the Canadian border.
[00:03:15.416 --> 00:03:17.037]  They say it's to stop V.C.'
[00:03:16.997 --> 00:03:18.417]  's strain of marijuana.
[00:03:18.457 --> 00:03:30.182]  They're putting stations in Plattsburgh, New York, Detroit, Grand Forks, North Dakota, Great Falls, Montana, and $35.2 million to get Bellingham, Washington fully operational.
[00:03:30.582 --> 00:03:33.063]  That's among other things that are going on.
[00:03:33.744 --> 00:03:36.105]  Another detail coming up tonight.
[00:03:37.305 --> 00:03:43.788]  Last night was Dick Cheney, and tonight is going to be the President of the United States speaking before the delegates.
[00:03:45.004 --> 00:03:51.710]  I caution you tonight, you're going to hear the name of God mentioned more times tonight than you can imagine.
[00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.394]  God bless America, God help us, God do this, God do that, God do the other.
[00:03:57.895 --> 00:03:59.397]  I will guarantee you two things.
[00:03:59.937 --> 00:04:06.663]  The next President of the United States will be a member of Skull and Bones, an association, a group
[00:04:07.276 --> 00:04:14.042]  Coming out of Yale University, where Alex has detailed this, where they had to sleep nude in a coffin, renounce God.
[00:04:14.502 --> 00:04:19.526]  These are some of the people who are going to be speaking tonight, and either the Republican or the Democratic.
[00:04:20.387 --> 00:04:26.992]  You've got Kerry, you've got Bush, Skull and Bones 67, Skull and Bones 68, doesn't make a major difference.
[00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:33.278]  But either one, you're going to have Skull and Bones, and you're going to have God mentioned prominently.
[00:04:34.238 --> 00:04:35.980]  What do these people know about God?
[00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:37.760]  Well, look around.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:44.366]  Here you had Arnold Schwarzenegger saying, the people must be economic girly men.
[00:04:44.706 --> 00:04:51.312]  For 1.3 million Americans who've sunk into poverty, put on a happy face, you gay guys!
[00:04:51.672 --> 00:04:53.393]  All you've sunk into poverty!
[00:04:53.413 --> 00:04:54.694]  1.3 million!
[00:04:56.216 --> 00:04:57.857]  One of Arnold's movies, True Life.
[00:04:58.077 --> 00:04:59.599]  Another predator.
[00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:00.319]  Think about it.
[00:05:00.359 --> 00:05:00.900]  We'll be back!
[00:05:01.605 --> 00:05:05.567]  Are you concerned about the quality of air and purity of water in your household?
[00:05:06.027 --> 00:05:13.070]  If you answered yes, then you owe it to yourself and your family to check out the amazing benefits of owning your own personal ozone generator.

[00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:10.101]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:10.181 --> 00:06:16.906]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:17.086 --> 00:06:20.088]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.

[00:07:13.972 --> 00:07:18.897]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.

[00:08:08.919 --> 00:08:10.000]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.501]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.262 --> 00:08:13.163]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.183 --> 00:08:17.567]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.007 --> 00:08:22.071]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.959 --> 00:08:24.881]  This is Erskine sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.982 --> 00:08:30.148]  I do a program on Saturday nights on GCN on most of these stations.
[00:08:30.168 --> 00:08:36.034]  It is on from 9 o'clock until midnight or midnight East Coast time, 9 o'clock West Coast time.
[00:08:36.615 --> 00:08:39.098]  But for answers, you want answers
[00:08:39.987 --> 00:08:50.355]  After the program, go to InfoWars.com or if you can't hear the program, go to InfoWars.com for those who are not listening to a radio station or don't have one available.
[00:08:50.836 --> 00:08:54.399]  InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:54.699 --> 00:08:57.841]  You've got to get the new video by Alex, American Dictators.
[00:08:58.062 --> 00:09:01.044]  It is talking about the election of 2004.
[00:09:01.384 --> 00:09:07.169]  How can Alex make a video about the election which hasn't occurred yet?
[00:09:07.791 --> 00:09:10.932]  Because you can look at it and see what's happening.
[00:09:11.212 --> 00:09:12.453]  You've got to get this.
[00:09:12.653 --> 00:09:13.874]  American Dictators.
[00:09:13.974 --> 00:09:17.255]  It's already pre-planned and laid out.
[00:09:17.955 --> 00:09:19.256]  American Dictators.
[00:09:19.736 --> 00:09:21.057]  The staged election of 2004.
[00:09:21.117 --> 00:09:25.959]  The video is only 1995.
[00:09:26.379 --> 00:09:25.959]  1995.
[00:09:26.559 --> 00:09:28.920]  And Alex says, make copies of it.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.521]  Pass it around to your friends.
[00:09:30.621 --> 00:09:34.882]  Get it out so that people know and understand and can be aware.
[00:09:35.002 --> 00:09:36.083]  Knowledge is something.
[00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:53.044]  That we need today more than ever Matrix of Evil another video that Alex has out $29.95 you need to get a copy of that and then Paul Joseph Watson is going to be with us talking about Order Out of Chaos Elite Sponsored Terrorism
[00:09:53.644 --> 00:10:02.250]  You know, 50% of the New Yorkers believe that the Bush Administration is not telling the truth and has something to do with the 9-11.
[00:10:03.771 --> 00:10:05.732]  50% of those in New York City!
[00:10:06.032 --> 00:10:10.255]  New York State has an equally high amount who believe
[00:10:10.775 --> 00:10:14.037]  That the government is hiding something about 9-11.
[00:10:15.358 --> 00:10:18.060]  These are the people who understand America.
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.821]  These are the people in New York.
[00:10:20.142 --> 00:10:20.882]  They're savvy.
[00:10:20.922 --> 00:10:24.765]  You're not going to pull the wool over the eyes of New Yorkers.
[00:10:25.285 --> 00:10:26.046]  It's there.
[00:10:26.266 --> 00:10:27.186]  They understand.
[00:10:27.207 --> 00:10:28.788]  That's according to the Zogby Poll.
[00:10:28.868 --> 00:10:30.409]  Half of New Yorkers believe U.S.
[00:10:30.469 --> 00:10:36.413]  leaders had foreknowledge of 9-11 attacks and consciously failed to act.
[00:10:37.819 --> 00:10:40.441]  I'll ask you one simple question about 9-11.
[00:10:41.562 --> 00:10:42.422]  Who was fired?
[00:10:43.023 --> 00:10:44.704]  Who in the government was fired?
[00:10:45.244 --> 00:10:52.209]  Other than the people working for the FBI who tried, who tried to pass this information on.
[00:10:52.749 --> 00:10:54.170]  They're the only ones who were fired.
[00:10:54.791 --> 00:11:03.457]  Okay, the comment that I just can't get over is Arnold Schwarzenegger calling people economic girly men.
[00:11:04.275 --> 00:11:08.076]  And we're talking about the 1.3 million who've sunk into poverty.
[00:11:08.136 --> 00:11:11.438]  We're talking about those who've lost their jobs.
[00:11:11.938 --> 00:11:17.660]  We're talking about those who are at the bottom of the rung, are now being called girly men.
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:24.142]  Okay, we're all about to be girly men under the Bushonian economic policies.
[00:11:24.763 --> 00:11:25.523]  Oil prices.
[00:11:26.063 --> 00:11:29.244]  How are they keeping prices at the pump so low?
[00:11:29.864 --> 00:11:31.165]  So low, people say!
[00:11:31.952 --> 00:11:34.513]  I gotta take out a loan to fill up those mobile!
[00:11:34.713 --> 00:11:40.976]  No, no, it's low in comparison because oil is at $45 a barrel.
[00:11:42.236 --> 00:11:47.678]  Generally the price with $45 a barrel oil at the pump should be $3.
[00:11:48.098 --> 00:11:52.460]  Try $1.93 where I live.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.320]  Should be $3.
[00:11:55.561 --> 00:11:58.582]  It will be by the end of September.
[00:11:58.963 --> 00:11:59.783]  Here's what happened.
[00:12:00.927 --> 00:12:03.828]  31 of the 50 states suspended their gas tax.
[00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:06.168]  31 of the 50 states.
[00:12:06.248 --> 00:12:11.309]  Those, if you're in a state with a Republican governor, chances are they have suspended the gas tax.
[00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:16.270]  And that is one of the reasons that the price has been kept down.
[00:12:17.811 --> 00:12:22.452]  And it takes 6 weeks reflection, the oil prices, to show up at the pumps.
[00:12:23.312 --> 00:12:27.113]  By the end of September, you are going to see $3 a barrel oil prices.
[00:12:29.611 --> 00:12:35.376]  The other economic girly men issue which should be addressed is the pension guarantee fund.
[00:12:36.257 --> 00:12:46.425]  These people, talk about your economic girly men, the pension guarantee fund when the Bush-Cheney regime took office had a surplus.
[00:12:46.925 --> 00:12:51.909]  Now it is 350 billion dollars in debt.
[00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:58.615]  Those working for Delta Airlines, matter of fact most of the airlines other than Southwest, most of the airlines
[00:12:59.813 --> 00:13:01.894]  The workers have lost their pension.
[00:13:02.815 --> 00:13:04.376]  Completely lost their pension.
[00:13:04.676 --> 00:13:09.319]  There was two trillion dollars worth of bad paper sold by the Carlyle Group.
[00:13:09.939 --> 00:13:11.780]  The Carlyle Group, we ever hear of that one?
[00:13:12.221 --> 00:13:19.065]  Sold by the Carlyle Group to the pension funds of Louisiana, Texas and other states.
[00:13:19.685 --> 00:13:22.687]  Now a couple of other things that you may be interested in.
[00:13:22.807 --> 00:13:25.289]  First off, where is Osama Bin Laden?
[00:13:26.118 --> 00:13:35.080]  According to articles up on PrisonPlan.com, InfoWars.com, he may be drug out before the election.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.502]  Well, let's hope he's drug out and we don't have another terror event in the United States.
[00:13:41.042 --> 00:13:48.143]  The fact that President Bush is now coming up in the polls and perhaps leading may allay the fact that we may have a terror event.
[00:13:49.044 --> 00:13:54.285]  Yes, it may be the fact that if people believe that the President is going to win,
[00:13:55.166 --> 00:14:08.038]  If it looks like he's ahead in the polls, if they're able to rig the election like they did last time, and President Bush, it looks like he's going to win the election, there may not be another terror event.
[00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:11.301]  Now, where's Osama Bin Laden?
[00:14:12.042 --> 00:14:13.003]  Are they going to pull him out?
[00:14:13.843 --> 00:14:16.845]  He's a person that the President has not been speaking about.
[00:14:17.285 --> 00:14:21.908]  You haven't heard him speak about Osama Bin Laden for the last, what has it been, 18 months?
[00:14:22.349 --> 00:14:28.813]  It was Bin Laden, he was the center of everything, and then Bin Laden, weirdly enough, morphed into Saddam Hussein.
[00:14:29.781 --> 00:14:30.902]  This is what we're after?
[00:14:30.922 --> 00:14:33.604]  He all of a sudden became Saddam Hussein.
[00:14:33.644 --> 00:14:35.786]  Saddam was responsible for 9-11.
[00:14:35.826 --> 00:14:36.667]  We all know that.
[00:14:37.307 --> 00:14:37.968]  Of course.
[00:14:38.288 --> 00:14:38.728]  Of course.
[00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:42.492]  Now our number here is 800-259-9231.
[00:14:42.872 --> 00:14:43.933]  Throwing out a few topics.
[00:14:43.993 --> 00:14:47.756]  If you're interested in talking about this, give us a call.
[00:14:47.776 --> 00:14:47.976]  800-259-9231.
[00:14:48.036 --> 00:14:49.958]  So these are some of the main issues.
[00:14:50.018 --> 00:14:52.000]  Now, what is going on next?
[00:14:57.253 --> 00:15:06.102]  I am looking at a report that came out that Iran in 2005 will launch a new oil exchange.
[00:15:06.983 --> 00:15:08.345]  A new oil exchange.
[00:15:08.405 --> 00:15:13.730]  Now what that's going to do is put an end to the western domination of international oil trade.
[00:15:14.091 --> 00:15:18.856]  The US and the UK, they're home to the world's largest oil markets.
[00:15:20.026 --> 00:15:35.792]  Aren't going to allow Iran to undermine their control because according to this they're going to be paid in dinars which is gold, gold backed payment that's all they want for oil is gold not fiat US dollars
[00:15:36.787 --> 00:15:40.388]  And if Iran comes through with this, then the game is up.
[00:15:40.729 --> 00:15:42.149]  Financially, the game is up.
[00:15:42.749 --> 00:15:48.291]  So the United States and Britain cannot allow Iran to launch the new oil exchange.
[00:15:48.792 --> 00:15:54.574]  This is one of the things that got Saddam in trouble when he wanted payment for oil in gold!
[00:15:55.574 --> 00:15:56.635]  What, is the guy nuts?
[00:15:56.695 --> 00:15:58.495]  He wants them to buy it with gold?
[00:15:59.096 --> 00:15:59.956]  He's crazy!
[00:16:01.102 --> 00:16:28.463]  and he was so crazy that they went after him they cannot allow payment for actually I think Saddam was actually trying to get payment in euros it has to be in US dollars otherwise otherwise our ship is sunk so when Iran is coming up with a new oil exchange based on gold they are panicked they are panicked so you're going to hear more and more about Saddam or rather Iran
[00:16:29.122 --> 00:16:31.204]  And their nuclear weapons program.
[00:16:31.624 --> 00:16:33.586]  We've got to stop Iran right now.
[00:16:33.926 --> 00:16:35.147]  Can't have them doing this.
[00:16:35.167 --> 00:16:42.113]  You're going to hear the same arguments dug out on Iran because of this new oil trading market.
[00:16:42.794 --> 00:16:46.116]  They're going to launch it for the Middle East and OPEC producers.
[00:16:46.517 --> 00:16:50.320]  It's going to threaten the supremacy of London's International Petroleum Exchange.
[00:16:51.104 --> 00:17:03.588]  A contract to design and establish a new platform for crude oil, natural gas, and petrochemical trades, and it's going to be signed with an international consortium actually within the next few days.
[00:17:04.828 --> 00:17:16.192]  Top oil producing countries are determined to seize more control of trading after being advised the existing markets, such as the IPE and NYMEX in New York, aren't working in their favor.
[00:17:17.112 --> 00:17:20.733]  Well, this is the final bounce.
[00:17:21.414 --> 00:17:31.801]  The Tehran Oil Bruce is scheduled to open in 2005 according to Mohammed Shaviv Asimpour, who's personal advisor to the Iranian Energy Minister.
[00:17:32.261 --> 00:17:41.527]  They're in the final stage of choosing a concession for what's going to be a very big development for them and for the region and for the world.
[00:17:42.388 --> 00:17:45.790]  This is going to be the one determining factor.
[00:17:46.824 --> 00:17:48.505]  One other story that I'm looking at.
[00:17:48.665 --> 00:17:54.029]  We're talking about a website called PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.731]  Are we living on a prison planet?
[00:17:56.791 --> 00:17:58.312]  Well, we're certainly close to it.
[00:17:58.493 --> 00:18:00.114]  Infowars.com.
[00:18:00.134 --> 00:18:01.815]  You've got to have the information.
[00:18:02.616 --> 00:18:03.656]  The no-fly list.
[00:18:04.697 --> 00:18:11.302]  I've talked to people who are candidates for other parties, other than Democrats and Republicans, and they are essentially on the no-fly list.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:24.230]  A 71-year-old retired English teacher, a man with top-secret government clearance, a woman whose name is similar to that of an Australian man, 20 years younger, and anyone with the name David Nelson.
[00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.092]  What do they all have in common with Ted Kennedy?
[00:18:28.313 --> 00:18:31.816]  Well, I'll tell you what they have in common with Ted Kennedy.
[00:18:31.836 --> 00:18:33.578]  They're all on this no-fly list.
[00:18:34.038 --> 00:18:37.761]  It took Ted Kennedy three months to get off of the no-fly list.
[00:18:38.496 --> 00:18:42.858]  Took him three weeks to get off of the no-fly list.
[00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:49.921]  Probably took him two weeks to discover that there was one, but it took him three weeks to get off of the no-fly list.
[00:18:51.041 --> 00:18:54.563]  That will show you exactly where we've come to.
[00:18:55.103 --> 00:18:57.004]  People thought CAPS was done with.
[00:18:57.284 --> 00:18:58.805]  No, CAPS is still with us.
[00:18:59.205 --> 00:19:00.985]  They still have the no-fly list.
[00:19:02.526 --> 00:19:04.567]  One other thing, and I was watching
[00:19:06.055 --> 00:19:11.378]  Vice President Cheney and of course that to me wasn't overly exciting.
[00:19:13.058 --> 00:19:19.501]  But on the first night they had Arnold Schwarzenegger and I can't believe what he said.
[00:19:20.322 --> 00:19:24.424]  He actually said that President Nixon was a breath of fresh air.
[00:19:25.704 --> 00:19:33.048]  Well, here's a man who was forced out of office who today would probably look like a breath of fresh air.
[00:19:33.658 --> 00:19:39.380]  But only somebody from a country that was formerly ruled by Adolf Hitler would think of it that way.
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:40.400]  Our number 800-259-9231.
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.921]  This is Alex Jones' radio program.
[00:19:45.221 --> 00:19:46.101]  Thank you for listening.

[00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:20.155]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:20:20.415 --> 00:20:23.557]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:20:23.817 --> 00:20:29.543]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.

[00:21:01.457 --> 00:21:02.959]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:21:03.159 --> 00:21:04.300]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.883]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:21:07.983 --> 00:21:08.403]  Phenol!
[00:21:08.724 --> 00:21:15.810]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:20.233]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:21:20.353 --> 00:21:20.794]  Fragrance?
[00:21:21.174 --> 00:21:25.937]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:21:26.057 --> 00:21:30.761]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[00:21:30.981 --> 00:21:33.403]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[00:21:33.783 --> 00:21:37.206]  Well, like all of the products from the Kalben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:21:37.346 --> 00:21:40.909]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.

[00:22:01.534 --> 00:22:07.738]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:08.198 --> 00:22:15.964]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:16.304 --> 00:22:24.169]  Is this a flaw free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:24.469 --> 00:22:29.230]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:34.271]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:34.791 --> 00:22:38.632]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:39.132 --> 00:22:40.152]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:40.212 --> 00:22:44.313]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[00:22:57.459 --> 00:22:58.279]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.541 --> 00:23:01.642]  Are you a diabetic?
[00:23:01.742 --> 00:23:03.063]  Do you know someone who is?
[00:23:03.123 --> 00:23:08.947]  Well, here's some great news that can save you time and money if you're required to test your blood sugar.
[00:23:09.247 --> 00:23:13.031]  Medicare and Medicaid may pay for your diabetes testing supplies.

[00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.870]  800-419-2335.
[00:23:58.712 --> 00:23:59.453]  We're good to go.
[00:24:15.629 --> 00:24:19.290]  Alex Jones is deeper behind enemy lines than you can imagine.
[00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:21.450]  He's actually in the belly of the beast.
[00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:24.931]  He is in New York right now, and he's going to be talking with us.
[00:24:25.611 --> 00:24:28.372]  And this is Erskine sitting in for Alex.
[00:24:28.432 --> 00:24:32.353]  To get in touch with me, you can go to my website and drop me a line.
[00:24:32.433 --> 00:24:36.634]  It's Erskine on radio, E-R-S-K-I-N-E on radio.com.
[00:24:37.034 --> 00:24:37.274]  You know,
[00:24:38.161 --> 00:24:42.522]  On one of the commercials, they were talking about The Creature from Jekyll Island by G. Edward Griffin.
[00:24:42.702 --> 00:24:44.263]  It is a terrific book.
[00:24:44.443 --> 00:24:47.064]  I've interviewed Mr. Griffin on a number of occasions.
[00:24:47.084 --> 00:24:52.365]  It tells you that the Federal Reserve System is, A, not federal, and B, there's no reserve.
[00:24:52.805 --> 00:24:55.006]  I love this truth in advertising.
[00:24:55.386 --> 00:24:57.126]  Not federal and no reserve.
[00:24:57.407 --> 00:24:59.767]  Yeah, that really sets it up, doesn't it?
[00:25:00.287 --> 00:25:02.468]  But it's a book which you really should have, and
[00:25:03.163 --> 00:25:09.506]  Ted Anderson, you buy the book, he's going to give you a silver dollar, some real money, so that's something well worth looking at.
[00:25:09.926 --> 00:25:13.668]  On this election, you've got a choice between the lesser of two evils.
[00:25:13.748 --> 00:25:15.789]  What's wrong with the lesser of two evils?
[00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:18.450]  You vote one, you're voting evil.
[00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:20.211]  You vote the other, you're voting evil.
[00:25:20.271 --> 00:25:22.932]  That's the problem with the lesser of two evils.
[00:25:22.952 --> 00:25:24.973]  You're still voting for evil.
[00:25:26.076 --> 00:25:27.077]  It doesn't matter.
[00:25:27.518 --> 00:25:29.640]  It doesn't make a difference.
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.603]  You've got Skull and Bones Gary, Skull and Bones Bush.
[00:25:33.044 --> 00:25:34.686]  You've got President Bush.
[00:25:35.433 --> 00:25:37.855]  Pretending to be from Texas, but he's from Maine.
[00:25:38.115 --> 00:25:39.437]  I have nothing against Maine.
[00:25:39.797 --> 00:25:41.899]  But he's pretending to be from Texas.
[00:25:42.259 --> 00:25:46.222]  You've got John Kerry, who's pretending to be Roman Catholic when he's Jewish.
[00:25:46.583 --> 00:25:51.207]  So here you've got two people who were given their marching orders, pretending to be something they aren't.
[00:25:51.267 --> 00:25:52.708]  So if he's Jewish, that's fine.
[00:25:53.168 --> 00:25:56.171]  If Mr. Bush is from Maine, that's fine.
[00:25:56.511 --> 00:25:59.074]  But they're both pretending to be something they aren't.
[00:26:26.364 --> 00:26:26.724]  Sherry.
[00:26:26.784 --> 00:26:27.625]  Sherry, are you there?
[00:26:27.645 --> 00:26:29.066]  Hello.
[00:26:29.106 --> 00:26:30.867]  Let's go immediately to Texas to Sherry.
[00:26:30.907 --> 00:26:31.668]  Sherry, are you there?
[00:26:31.688 --> 00:26:32.248]  Yes, sir.
[00:26:32.308 --> 00:26:33.068]  Can you hear me?
[00:26:33.849 --> 00:26:34.850]  I certainly can.
[00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:37.211]  And good morning to you.
[00:26:37.231 --> 00:26:37.771]  Good morning to you.
[00:26:37.791 --> 00:26:38.672]  You've got a comment.
[00:26:39.052 --> 00:26:39.753]  I sure do.
[00:26:39.813 --> 00:26:42.975]  I wanted to thank you for sitting in for Alex.
[00:26:43.555 --> 00:26:45.797]  And I wanted to... Oh, it's my pleasure, Sherry.
[00:26:46.037 --> 00:26:47.698]  Man, we are... I tell you what.
[00:26:47.738 --> 00:26:48.838]  Talk about on the mark.
[00:26:49.259 --> 00:26:52.040]  Alex is doing an amazing job.
[00:26:52.501 --> 00:26:54.282]  I couldn't grab a tape in time.
[00:26:54.738 --> 00:27:00.122]  So for any and everybody out there, keep an eye out on the C-SPAN about 5-11.
[00:27:00.182 --> 00:27:07.488]  Alex, as they're interviewing the delegates, he gets interviewed, and he said it all.
[00:27:07.689 --> 00:27:09.370]  I was jumping for joy.
[00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:10.791]  He said it all.
[00:27:10.831 --> 00:27:17.617]  He said that Bush and Kerry are the same, that they're cousins, they're skull and bones, and this new world order.
[00:27:17.957 --> 00:27:21.660]  And he was calm, focused, totally, I mean, it was
[00:27:22.577 --> 00:27:24.959]  He's speaking for us, and that's why I get excited.
[00:27:24.999 --> 00:27:26.279]  He's speaking for our children.
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:35.385]  Well, Sherry, don't you believe that either you vote for Bush or you vote for Kerry, you're voting the lesser of two evils, and the lesser of two evils is what?
[00:27:35.465 --> 00:27:36.245]  It's evil!
[00:27:36.265 --> 00:27:37.206]  It's still evil.
[00:27:38.507 --> 00:27:39.027]  It's still evil.
[00:27:39.067 --> 00:27:40.028]  And we know that.
[00:27:40.468 --> 00:27:41.048]  We know that.
[00:27:41.128 --> 00:27:47.472]  Now, the video, the American dictator, how could he do a video on the 2004 election before it's occurred?
[00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:49.454]  Because it's already occurred.
[00:27:49.514 --> 00:27:50.874]  It's already pre-planned.
[00:27:51.115 --> 00:27:51.615]  That's right.
[00:27:53.426 --> 00:27:55.247]  And we're just going through the motions.
[00:27:55.327 --> 00:27:58.247]  But you say his, tell them a little bit more about his interview.
[00:27:58.267 --> 00:28:00.728]  You say it was just absolutely dramatic.
[00:28:01.128 --> 00:28:13.312]  It was great because you have these total, you know, little clone, neocon Republicans, and you know, everybody talking about, you know, Hale Bush.
[00:28:14.072 --> 00:28:17.813]  And there Alex is, you know, and he looks the part.
[00:28:17.853 --> 00:28:19.293]  He looks totally professional.
[00:28:19.533 --> 00:28:20.374]  And it's live.
[00:28:20.774 --> 00:28:21.734]  So they don't, you know,
[00:28:22.711 --> 00:28:24.792]  They just let him talk.
[00:28:24.852 --> 00:28:25.852]  He said it all.
[00:28:26.492 --> 00:28:27.953]  He said it all.
[00:28:27.993 --> 00:28:30.754]  They did not cut him.
[00:28:31.154 --> 00:28:34.015]  He was calm and to the point and said it all.
[00:28:34.055 --> 00:28:35.375]  It was so beautiful.
[00:28:35.415 --> 00:28:38.316]  So somebody out there has got to have
[00:28:38.846 --> 00:28:39.687]  A tape of this?
[00:28:39.847 --> 00:28:45.170]  I don't imagine that C-SPAN is going to allow that tape to exist very long.
[00:28:46.431 --> 00:28:48.953]  No, no, I think you're probably right.
[00:28:49.774 --> 00:29:01.842]  But you've got to run those tape recorders when you've got something like C-SPAN live because next time, I remember Congolese Rice testifying before the 9-11 Commission when they asked her and she said,
[00:29:02.483 --> 00:29:09.808]  We had no idea that a missile was going to fly into the Pentagon, and then when you go back and read the transcript, that's out of there!
[00:29:10.249 --> 00:29:11.530]  It was right on schedule.
[00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:13.191]  It was right on schedule.
[00:29:13.211 --> 00:29:13.551]  Absolutely.
[00:29:13.771 --> 00:29:19.375]  So when they talk about they're messing up and they're behind, well they're not on a schedule just like General Partin says.
[00:29:19.575 --> 00:29:20.796]  It's a program.
[00:29:21.177 --> 00:29:22.858]  They're following their program.
[00:29:23.618 --> 00:29:29.423]  So the New World Order that's carrying me is just a mass of brainwashed people.
[00:29:30.698 --> 00:29:31.518]  You've got it.
[00:29:31.618 --> 00:29:32.379]  You've got it.
[00:29:32.739 --> 00:29:34.540]  Sherry, thanks so much for the call.
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:35.900]  Bill, we'll be right with you.
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:39.702]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[00:29:41.422 --> 00:29:42.623]  We're on the march.
[00:29:42.663 --> 00:29:44.283]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:44.423 --> 00:29:46.484]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.985 --> 00:30:09.467]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:09.887 --> 00:30:14.109]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:30:14.349 --> 00:30:21.372]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:21.752 --> 00:30:27.874]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:28.015 --> 00:30:29.235]  There are no side effects.
[00:30:29.575 --> 00:30:32.518]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:30:32.678 --> 00:30:34.699]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:42.246]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:30:42.526 --> 00:30:45.929]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:30:46.349 --> 00:30:49.434]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[00:30:49.454 --> 00:30:49.494]  866-885-6625.
[00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:49.735]  866-885-6625.
[00:30:49.815 --> 00:30:50.696]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:30:50.756 --> 00:30:50.997]  Call today.
[00:31:01.377 --> 00:31:03.338]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[00:31:03.418 --> 00:31:14.142]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.502 --> 00:31:19.024]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:19.104 --> 00:31:30.428]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:31.028 --> 00:31:37.878]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:38.278 --> 00:31:40.401]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:31:40.902 --> 00:31:45.869]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[00:31:46.169 --> 00:31:52.471]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.551 --> 00:31:56.732]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:31:56.953 --> 00:31:57.713]  That's toll free.
[00:31:57.733 --> 00:31:57.773]  888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.574 --> 00:32:05.239]  You've heard about PAWS from Bio-Ox International and its bubble-up technology.
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:09.846]  But have you heard about Bio-Oxytrus Concentrate that also uses bubble-up technology?
[00:32:10.086 --> 00:32:17.016]  Bio-Oxytrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[00:32:17.396 --> 00:32:24.046]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color crayons.
[00:32:24.367 --> 00:32:27.832]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate.
[00:32:27.972 --> 00:32:28.793]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit bio-ox.com.
[00:32:32.939 --> 00:32:40.083]  Bubble Up Technology is part of the reason Bio-Ox International will guarantee you will have a cleaner and healthier home after using Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate.
[00:32:40.163 --> 00:32:46.847]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[00:32:47.067 --> 00:32:51.730]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit Bio-Ox.com.
[00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:54.451]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[00:32:54.611 --> 00:32:59.254]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use Bio-Ox family of products.
[00:33:06.551 --> 00:33:08.472]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.932 --> 00:33:11.793]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:30.562 --> 00:33:34.684]  This is Erskine sitting in for Alex Jones and
[00:33:35.808 --> 00:33:37.790]  As if anyone can sit in for Alex Jones.
[00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:49.820]  Alex Jones, who just appeared on C-SPAN, according to Sherry in Texas, calm, cool, in the belly of the beast, telling it like it is on television, live, where it can't be cut.
[00:33:50.826 --> 00:33:51.507]  Wonderful!
[00:33:51.807 --> 00:33:52.348]  Wonderful!
[00:33:52.528 --> 00:33:54.209]  You want to find out about the election?
[00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:57.393]  You really want to know what's going on in the election right now?
[00:33:57.413 --> 00:33:57.393]  1995.
[00:33:57.833 --> 00:34:00.335]  It's called American Dictators.
[00:34:00.696 --> 00:34:02.117]  The staged election of 2004.
[00:34:02.838 --> 00:34:04.740]  Alex has this video out.
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:08.744]  Get it out and get it in people's hands before the election.
[00:34:09.024 --> 00:34:10.085]  Make copies of it.
[00:34:10.425 --> 00:34:11.927]  Play it anywhere you want to.
[00:34:12.407 --> 00:34:25.962]  Go to PrisonPlan.com, Infowars.com, but get this video, American Dictators, also Matrix of Evil and Order Out of Chaos by Paul Joseph Watson, who's going to be joining us as he's been on this program all week.
[00:34:26.362 --> 00:34:29.185]  To get in touch with me, Erskine on Radio.com.
[00:34:29.926 --> 00:34:34.351]  And my program is on Saturday nights at 9 o'clock Pacific,
[00:34:35.134 --> 00:34:36.454]  Midnight on the East Coast.
[00:34:36.494 --> 00:34:42.295]  Let's go to Bill in Vermont, the Green Mountain State, where they've got the best maple syrup in the entire world.
[00:34:42.416 --> 00:34:44.936]  Bill, welcome to Alex Jones.
[00:34:45.636 --> 00:34:46.476]  Oh, thank you, sir.
[00:34:47.056 --> 00:34:48.097]  I'm calling in today.
[00:34:48.297 --> 00:34:51.537]  I just want to say that I had some problems with the law the other day.
[00:34:51.597 --> 00:34:59.419]  They raided my house and took some of my sacred plants, or not plants, but herbs, and I think that
[00:35:00.049 --> 00:35:01.230]  This is completely wrong.
[00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:14.962]  I've always been taught by the hand of God to use herbs to heal myself and I feel that it's terribly wrong that they can break into my house and take my marijuana and they took my money and they think that I'm some drug dealer and I'm not.
[00:35:15.342 --> 00:35:19.846]  Just a normal American trying to heal myself in these troubled times like the rest of us.
[00:35:20.698 --> 00:35:22.939]  Bill, let me tell you how bad it's got.
[00:35:22.979 --> 00:35:30.922]  There are 3.2% of the American population, adult American population, is now in prison.
[00:35:30.982 --> 00:35:33.183]  Most of them on petty drug charges.
[00:35:33.683 --> 00:35:36.224]  In prison, parole, or on probation.
[00:35:36.264 --> 00:35:40.185]  Now, let me explain to you where I feel on this issue.
[00:35:40.225 --> 00:35:42.106]  My mother had cancer that she died of.
[00:35:42.862 --> 00:35:46.604]  And the neighborhood kids would all bring her by a little bit of pot to help her.
[00:35:46.964 --> 00:35:48.204]  It was the only thing that helped her.
[00:35:48.284 --> 00:35:53.707]  If someone's dying, you tell me that you can't have a product like that grows naturally like marijuana.
[00:35:53.767 --> 00:35:55.287]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:35:55.327 --> 00:35:56.668]  Let's get real.
[00:35:56.788 --> 00:36:04.371]  They can pump you full of synthetic chemicals that are exact copies of what's in these substances that they're taking away from the people.
[00:36:05.297 --> 00:36:07.198]  It's not exact copies, Bill.
[00:36:07.258 --> 00:36:08.659]  It doesn't work.
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:12.302]  We had the THC prescribed and it didn't work.
[00:36:12.562 --> 00:36:13.902]  Did not work?
[00:36:14.023 --> 00:36:15.684]  No, the THC didn't work.
[00:36:15.724 --> 00:36:19.746]  The marijuana worked, but the THC did not work with my mother.
[00:36:19.786 --> 00:36:22.408]  I'm talking about my own mother who had cancer.
[00:36:22.428 --> 00:36:23.148]  It didn't work.
[00:36:23.368 --> 00:36:24.989]  I know what you're talking about.
[00:36:25.149 --> 00:36:25.890]  It didn't work.
[00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:26.910]  The marijuana worked.
[00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:29.392]  We took it and mashed it up and put it in little capsules.
[00:36:29.832 --> 00:36:32.434]  There's a record increase of depression and suicide.
[00:36:33.075 --> 00:36:38.062]  The suicide rate is a 56% increase from when Mr. Bush took over.
[00:36:38.363 --> 00:36:39.765]  Let's talk about hard liquor.
[00:36:40.125 --> 00:36:42.268]  Man, talk about success!
[00:36:42.328 --> 00:36:45.113]  Hard liquor sales are up 38% from when Mr. Bush took over.
[00:36:48.317 --> 00:36:49.658]  This is what's going on.
[00:36:49.738 --> 00:36:54.902]  Look at the new program to test everybody for mental health and issue them Prozac.
[00:36:55.222 --> 00:36:57.684]  I've got a good friend of mine just going on Zoloft.
[00:36:58.024 --> 00:36:59.885]  Let's get real people.
[00:37:00.305 --> 00:37:01.506]  Let's look at what's happening.
[00:37:01.526 --> 00:37:04.648]  We have an orange alert, a red alert, a pink chartreuse.
[00:37:04.688 --> 00:37:05.789]  What's our alert color?
[00:37:05.809 --> 00:37:12.414]  They're just jerking us around with those things and they're raiding people and they're taking away their money, their livelihood, everything.
[00:37:12.894 --> 00:37:16.817]  Including some herbs that they may have for their own health.
[00:37:17.037 --> 00:37:17.717]  That's it.
[00:37:17.877 --> 00:37:20.559]  I mean, it's the freedom.
[00:37:20.819 --> 00:37:23.401]  We are under a police state, make no mistake about it.
[00:37:23.421 --> 00:37:32.908]  I just want to conclude that Alex is doing a wonderful thing, and I wish I had cleaned myself out earlier, even though I feel that it was God's gift to me.
[00:37:32.928 --> 00:37:36.450]  I wish I had, so that way I can fight the world order more.
[00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:48.020]  But, you know, I just want to let everyone else know, be extremely careful, and we will prevail eventually, because, you know, it's the righteous that will prevail, and, you know, the true evil of this world.
[00:37:49.153 --> 00:37:56.459]  Well, we have read the Bible, Bill, and we know what happens in the end, and it makes no sense to go with the other side.
[00:37:56.499 --> 00:38:03.245]  You've got to do what is the right thing to do, and you have to ask yourself, what would Jesus do?
[00:38:03.325 --> 00:38:07.929]  You've got to stay on that side and do the positive and think about it in terms of
[00:38:08.564 --> 00:38:15.086]  In those terms, not saying God bless America and all these phrases and then go out and do everything else that's wrong.
[00:38:15.426 --> 00:38:16.607]  That doesn't mean anything.
[00:38:17.307 --> 00:38:21.528]  Any God that I believe in is looking at actions, not words.
[00:38:22.408 --> 00:38:23.689]  Well, thank you, sir.
[00:38:24.049 --> 00:38:24.629]  Thank you, Bill.
[00:38:24.669 --> 00:38:26.250]  I appreciate you and Alex.
[00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:28.210]  Thank you so much, Bill.
[00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:31.871]  Let's go immediately to Fred, and God bless Alex for the work that he's doing.
[00:38:32.171 --> 00:38:33.752]  Fred in South Dakota.
[00:38:33.772 --> 00:38:34.352]  How are you doing?
[00:38:34.372 --> 00:38:34.812]  Hi, Fred.
[00:38:35.132 --> 00:38:35.653]  Very good.
[00:38:35.813 --> 00:38:36.933]  And how are you, Mr. Erskine?
[00:38:37.757 --> 00:38:39.718]  Fred, I couldn't be better if I had to.
[00:38:39.798 --> 00:38:41.038]  Now, tell me what you got.
[00:38:41.598 --> 00:38:43.438]  Oh, I just got the shock of my life.
[00:38:43.558 --> 00:38:46.059]  Maybe, maybe my spirit's different.
[00:38:46.139 --> 00:38:58.782]  I don't know what it is, Steriskens, but I talked to a woman and actually showed her the InfoWars article on the nine-year-old boy in New Mexico and the actions of the police.
[00:38:59.562 --> 00:39:06.604]  And the lady had advised me that she was a bus driver at one time and that children can be very disruptive.
[00:39:07.461 --> 00:39:09.302]  And I invite you to look.
[00:39:09.562 --> 00:39:10.863]  There was no judge involved.
[00:39:11.243 --> 00:39:12.764]  There was no court order involved.
[00:39:13.065 --> 00:39:16.647]  There was no unlawful charge or act involved.
[00:39:17.567 --> 00:39:19.569]  Normally it would be a school policy.
[00:39:19.849 --> 00:39:22.290]  I mean, what are these guys with badges doing?
[00:39:22.411 --> 00:39:28.735]  The reason it hit me is I used to be a police officer for many years and I got out.
[00:39:30.776 --> 00:39:33.798]  What I read there and heard about on the days before
[00:39:34.989 --> 00:39:40.473]  It affected me so deeply because I used to, uh, I used to bend over backwards for little ones.
[00:39:40.513 --> 00:39:41.995]  And I'm talking a nine year old.
[00:39:42.415 --> 00:39:44.497]  They're beyond the age of, of culpability.
[00:39:45.257 --> 00:39:45.918]  They're below it.
[00:39:46.058 --> 00:39:49.641]  And what do they, what do they teach in these police officers?
[00:39:49.701 --> 00:39:52.343]  I mean, how to pull wings off flies.
[00:39:52.463 --> 00:40:04.112]  I'm, I'm, this upsets me because I've had explained to this lady, if they can do this to an innocent nine year old child and they're innocent to start with, you know, as a law, period.
[00:40:04.767 --> 00:40:06.109]  Boys with Bans and Snow Bans.
[00:40:13.659 --> 00:40:15.920]  Uh, they're now deputizing them as U.S.
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:16.440]  Marshals.
[00:40:17.041 --> 00:40:19.782]  And so now, you're losing even your local police.
[00:40:19.842 --> 00:40:23.984]  It's all falling under a federal jurisdiction, so we're losing the local police.
[00:40:24.004 --> 00:40:30.827]  And if we get into what's going on with the police, it's a very, very sad situation because you knew the community.
[00:40:30.887 --> 00:40:32.628]  You were there to serve and protect.
[00:40:33.149 --> 00:40:33.689]  No longer.
[00:40:33.969 --> 00:40:34.509]  No longer.
[00:40:34.589 --> 00:40:37.431]  That's one of the reasons I'll guarantee you got out of the police force.
[00:40:38.559 --> 00:40:42.600]  On the street, I've met a few of them, and I'm terribly sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:44.401]  I'm very disgusted at what we've got out there.
[00:40:44.921 --> 00:40:46.121]  I have to agree with Alex.
[00:40:46.761 --> 00:40:49.102]  They don't even know what a Title 18 U.S.
[00:40:49.162 --> 00:40:49.922]  Code is.
[00:40:49.942 --> 00:40:53.083]  They say, are you a lawyer or something?
[00:40:53.143 --> 00:40:54.384]  I say, well, don't be assaulting me.
[00:40:55.804 --> 00:40:58.125]  Did you ever serve in the military?
[00:40:58.545 --> 00:40:59.145]  Yes, I did, sir.
[00:40:59.818 --> 00:41:04.001]  Didn't you take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States of America?
[00:41:04.281 --> 00:41:04.982]  Yes, I did.
[00:41:05.502 --> 00:41:06.043]  I was a draftee.
[00:41:06.123 --> 00:41:11.186]  And how many people today know about the Constitution of the United States of America?
[00:41:11.226 --> 00:41:14.268]  There are 872 books, 874 I'm sorry, that if you look at them they are considered questionable by
[00:41:19.532 --> 00:41:27.419]  Uh, the Attorney General of the United States, if you check them out of the library, if you get them from Amazon, are any of them about how to make bombs?
[00:41:27.639 --> 00:41:27.879]  No.
[00:41:27.999 --> 00:41:30.161]  Are any of them about anything like that?
[00:41:30.241 --> 00:41:30.441]  No.
[00:41:30.461 --> 00:41:32.403]  They're all about the Constitution.
[00:41:32.563 --> 00:41:44.533]  You take an oath, and I know, I know as sure as God made little green apples, Fred, you took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, and now they're not even allowing you to read about that document, that great document that
[00:41:45.053 --> 00:41:52.054]  Yes, and it's a sorry thing.
[00:41:52.134 --> 00:41:54.815]  And the complacency, my friend, is horrible.
[00:41:56.035 --> 00:42:00.256]  I've tried waking people up, and you're a follower that's probably dealt a lot on talk shows.
[00:42:01.116 --> 00:42:03.756]  How could you respond on that?
[00:42:04.096 --> 00:42:05.317]  I mean, I was so shocked.
[00:42:06.917 --> 00:42:08.757]  With such complacency.
[00:42:08.837 --> 00:42:11.518]  Oh, the sun shines right, and the police are always right.
[00:42:13.074 --> 00:42:14.034]  How could I respond?
[00:42:14.755 --> 00:42:22.177]  The only person that I've heard who had a really marvelous response to that was Al Martin, who was on my program a number of times and every month.
[00:42:22.277 --> 00:42:25.638]  And Al said, there are only three things that are going to wake up the American people.
[00:42:25.719 --> 00:42:28.519]  Number one, if the NFL goes pay-for-view.
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:31.040]  Number two, if the beer trucks stop running.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:36.382]  And number three, if Domino's Pizza refuses to deliver, he said, then the American people will wake up.
[00:42:37.763 --> 00:42:38.483]  Isn't that terrible?
[00:42:38.803 --> 00:42:40.584]  Fred, thanks so much for the call.
[00:42:40.784 --> 00:42:41.344]  Okay, bye-bye.
[00:42:42.199 --> 00:42:43.480]  Let's go immediately.
[00:42:43.861 --> 00:42:44.722]  Let's see who is there.
[00:42:46.243 --> 00:42:47.044]  Paul is there.
[00:42:47.604 --> 00:42:55.051]  Paul Joseph Watson is here with us, author of Order Out of Chaos, and this is the book.
[00:42:55.231 --> 00:43:00.756]  It tells everything that's going on, and Paul, I wish to goodness it wasn't so accurate.
[00:43:01.597 --> 00:43:03.319]  Well, hello, it's good to be on the air again.
[00:43:04.156 --> 00:43:13.724]  Um, before we get into the news, I think you had a caller around about 15 minutes ago who was talking about Alex's appearance on C-SPAN, and I've been getting calls about that as well.
[00:43:14.164 --> 00:43:33.179]  So, just to put the call out, obviously, if anyone has taped that interview, then please send it to Alex at his South Lamar address, or better still, if you can rip it and get it on an online format, please email it to me, and I'll post it on the website.
[00:43:33.883 --> 00:43:36.564]  You want that email to you at PrisonPlanet.com?
[00:43:37.405 --> 00:43:39.546]  Yeah, the email address is on the website.
[00:43:39.566 --> 00:43:43.968]  A quick update on what's been happening in New York.
[00:43:44.048 --> 00:43:53.192]  Obviously tonight we're expecting the majority of protests and any possible provocateur actions to take place before and after Bush's speech.
[00:43:53.996 --> 00:43:59.620]  But in the news today are more examples of police brutality, as you mentioned at the top of the show.
[00:44:01.021 --> 00:44:07.706]  Firstly, they're arresting the protesters and taking them to this retrofitted bus station called Pier 57.
[00:44:08.386 --> 00:44:10.928]  And really, I mean, the only difference between it
[00:44:11.668 --> 00:44:25.101]  And Guantanamo Bay are the orange jumpsuits because they've set up these pen-style cages which scores of protesters are kept in cramped conditions without food or water for anything up to, you know, 18 to 24 hours at a time.
[00:44:26.922 --> 00:44:28.724]  The air is poisoned with asbestos.
[00:44:28.964 --> 00:44:30.906]  You know, there's motor oil all over the floor.
[00:44:31.526 --> 00:44:36.110]  And so, I mean, it's pertinent to ask, why are these people there in the first place?
[00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:40.394]  And we've got a New York Daily News article today on the website which talks about this.
[00:44:40.974 --> 00:44:49.942]  Married couples who were in New York for a honeymoon weren't even involved with the protests, were part of the mass roundups that occurred on Tuesday night.
[00:44:50.782 --> 00:44:58.026]  Middle-aged mothers who were trying to get home from work passing through Ground Zero, grabbed and taken to this same facility.
[00:44:58.847 --> 00:45:02.669]  People who stood on barricades to get a better view of the protest were arrested.
[00:45:02.689 --> 00:45:07.451]  Most of you listeners will remember the story that came out on Friday night with the arrest of 200
[00:45:08.905 --> 00:45:09.205]  I don't
[00:45:28.348 --> 00:45:44.543]  And the security is a joke, because the same newspaper reports that it's ridiculously easy for anyone to acquire a pass to get into the convention, and yet there's supposed to be this so-called national security perimeter around the convention itself, so...
[00:45:45.103 --> 00:45:54.465]  Well, the cops are beating old ladies in the face, arresting medics so they can't get treatment, and plowing into large groups of people with mopeds.
[00:45:54.605 --> 00:45:58.745]  People are just walking straight into the convention with somebody else's pass.
[00:45:59.246 --> 00:46:05.007]  They had protesters who were arrested inside the convention yesterday just walking right in.
[00:46:05.327 --> 00:46:10.088]  The other thing that got me, Paul, and all this information is up on prisonplanet.com,
[00:46:12.888 --> 00:46:15.969]  Infowars.com, either one of those websites.
[00:46:16.330 --> 00:46:21.752]  The other thing that got me was they were chanting, this is what a prison state looks like.
[00:46:21.892 --> 00:46:23.913]  This is what a prison state looks like.
[00:46:24.013 --> 00:46:33.416]  Well, Alex's message got to those people inside those cages, the tourists who were taken in and the people there.
[00:46:33.756 --> 00:46:35.977]  They're going to be listening to Alex's message.
[00:46:35.997 --> 00:46:37.238]  They're seeing it first hand.
[00:46:37.778 --> 00:46:42.280]  We're trying to wake people up so they don't have to see it first hand in this great land of ours.
[00:46:43.058 --> 00:46:43.639]  Well, that's true.
[00:46:43.679 --> 00:46:48.904]  I mean, all these armed cops are just another example of what I've been, you know, ranting about all week.
[00:46:49.285 --> 00:46:56.513]  They're not there to stop terrorists, because, you know, can anyone give me an example of when armed terrorists have had firefights with cops in America?
[00:46:56.973 --> 00:47:03.881]  If they were really terrorists who wanted to assassinate Republicans, they could just walk in right through the front door with somebody else's pass.
[00:47:04.261 --> 00:47:19.561]  So, I mean, the police state, if anything, makes the city less secure because the policy is to brutally suppress the peaceful protesters while any real threat from people gaining access to the convention building itself is completely ignored.
[00:47:20.482 --> 00:47:25.287]  It's more about thought control than it is about terror control.
[00:47:25.507 --> 00:47:26.268]  Thought control.
[00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:28.471]  They don't want you speaking freely.
[00:47:28.511 --> 00:47:29.872]  They don't want you thinking.
[00:47:30.192 --> 00:47:33.376]  You've got to follow the line and the party line.
[00:47:33.436 --> 00:47:35.318]  That's what they are talking about.
[00:47:35.858 --> 00:47:37.279]  And is that not true?
[00:47:37.439 --> 00:47:41.982]  It's not about terror at all, or terror suspects, or anything else.
[00:47:42.062 --> 00:47:49.407]  It's the same thing with the Patriot Act, where you've got, we were talking about the 874 books that are questioned.
[00:47:49.788 --> 00:47:53.070]  None of those books have anything to do with terrorism.
[00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:57.073]  They're all questionable because they're talking about the Constitution.
[00:47:57.553 --> 00:48:00.615]  They're more afraid of thoughts than they are of bullets.
[00:48:00.675 --> 00:48:01.856]  They understand terror.
[00:48:02.416 --> 00:48:04.877]  They're responsible for it, so they understand it.
[00:48:04.977 --> 00:48:06.897]  Read the book, Order Out of Chaos.
[00:48:07.457 --> 00:48:11.038]  Nobody understands terrorism more than the leaders.
[00:48:11.578 --> 00:48:12.538]  Am I correct, Paul?
[00:48:13.418 --> 00:48:13.898]  Well, yeah.
[00:48:14.519 --> 00:48:20.500]  What they define as terrorism, as you were pointing out, is any kind of political activism.
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:29.022]  I mean, we've got a story on the top of PrisonPlanet.com right now with the headline, 19-year-old with political bumper sticker gets visit from Secret Service.
[00:48:29.542 --> 00:48:31.222]  Now, this was a teenager in
[00:48:31.722 --> 00:48:33.103]  We're good to go.
[00:48:51.931 --> 00:49:04.817]  I mean, in every case I see of this, you know, Stasi-like behaviour, what amazes me equally is not just that these idiots who, you know, make the call, but the fact that the Secret Service actually turn up to investigate it.
[00:49:05.387 --> 00:49:11.370]  No, I've talked to people who have had their neighbours called the Department of Defence because they stay up late at night.
[00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:15.612]  And again, the DoD turned up and started asking questions.
[00:49:15.672 --> 00:49:17.573]  So, I mean, you know, what does this tell us?
[00:49:17.653 --> 00:49:26.378]  It tells us that the government seriously believes that political bumper stickers and staying up past 1am are, you know, signs of potential terrorism.
[00:49:27.059 --> 00:49:38.060]  And as I mentioned earlier, even if you believe there are terrorists in America, just like the passes to get into the convention, any real threat is purposefully ignored.
[00:49:38.887 --> 00:49:49.795]  We've got a whole section on prisonplanet.com in the Police State Archive under the dissent is subversive category, where there are numerous past examples of this kind of thing.
[00:49:50.296 --> 00:49:55.700]  Twelve-year-old boys being investigated for doing school research papers on Chesapeake Bay Bridge.
[00:49:56.561 --> 00:50:01.624]  Teenage students who criticized Bush in a class debate in Oakland.
[00:50:01.684 --> 00:50:03.466]  The teacher calls the FBI again.
[00:50:04.326 --> 00:50:07.727]  People arrested for wearing anti-bush t-shirts in shopping malls.
[00:50:08.208 --> 00:50:14.790]  Neighbors calling police on a man in North Carolina who hung an upside-down American flag outside his house.
[00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:19.552]  So, I mean, what has America come to when these kind of people are seen as a threat?
[00:50:19.692 --> 00:50:20.832]  It's absolutely crazy.
[00:50:22.173 --> 00:50:29.995]  I've had, uh, given out the deception dollars, which you're very familiar with, and I had people say, I can't go to those websites, they'll know where I'm going.
[00:50:30.876 --> 00:50:31.276]  And I said,
[00:50:32.131 --> 00:50:34.794]  You are in America and you're afraid of that?
[00:50:35.014 --> 00:50:38.538]  If you're that afraid of it, you better consider something else.
[00:50:38.658 --> 00:50:40.040]  Think of what you're saying.
[00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:44.085]  You're afraid to go to a website because they will know what you're doing.
[00:50:44.345 --> 00:50:48.389]  We'll be back with Paul Joseph Watson and your calls right here at 800-259-9231.
[00:50:48.409 --> 00:50:49.591]  It's the Alex Jones Radio Program!
[00:51:02.392 --> 00:51:05.314]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:51:05.994 --> 00:51:07.275]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:51:07.475 --> 00:51:13.218]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:51:13.498 --> 00:51:18.761]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:51:19.042 --> 00:51:23.144]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:51:23.484 --> 00:51:27.147]  Nightmarish, post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:51:27.387 --> 00:51:32.011]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:51:32.131 --> 00:51:34.893]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[00:51:35.194 --> 00:51:38.396]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[00:51:38.436 --> 00:51:40.258]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:52:05.663 --> 00:52:11.087]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.

[00:52:21.914 --> 00:52:26.257]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:26.357 --> 00:52:26.857]  I don't know.
[00:52:41.531 --> 00:52:46.015]  Yes, the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[00:53:18.058 --> 00:53:18.658]  I think so.
[00:53:40.626 --> 00:53:41.566]  We're good to go!
[00:54:09.141 --> 00:54:09.342]  Woo!
[00:54:20.874 --> 00:54:34.483]  This is the Alex Jones Radio Program you're listening to, and this is Erskine Substitute hosting for Alex, as if anyone could really substitute for the great Alex Jones, sitting in temporarily today and tomorrow for Alex Jones.
[00:54:34.584 --> 00:54:43.690]  His website, www.infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, where you can get a copy of his new video, American Dictators.
[00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:47.792]  The staged election of 2004 for 1995.
[00:54:47.852 --> 00:54:50.254]  Learn about the upcoming election.
[00:54:50.754 --> 00:54:52.195]  He's got it all there.
[00:54:52.575 --> 00:54:53.776]  You don't even have to vote.
[00:54:53.856 --> 00:54:55.717]  It's already been decided for you.
[00:54:55.797 --> 00:54:58.498]  Diebold and these other companies have set it aside.
[00:54:58.879 --> 00:55:01.420]  You've got the lesser of two evils who's going to win.
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:03.221]  I'll tell you two things that are going to happen.
[00:55:03.261 --> 00:55:04.222]  Number one, someone
[00:55:04.782 --> 00:55:07.123]  from Skull and Bones is going to be elected president.
[00:55:07.163 --> 00:55:14.847]  And number two, you're not going to hear any terror alerts going to Orange and Tom Ridge and those boys are not going to be on television this week.
[00:55:15.147 --> 00:55:19.248]  This is the safest week to be anywhere in the United States of America.
[00:55:19.849 --> 00:55:22.970]  To get in touch with me, Erskine on Radio.com.
[00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:25.251]  E-R-S-K-I-N-E on Radio.com.
[00:55:25.631 --> 00:55:33.975]  And coming up Saturday night at nine o'clock Pacific, midnight on the East Coast, Professor Donald W. Scott from Ontario, Canada is going to be talking about
[00:55:34.822 --> 00:55:39.625]  AIDS and chronic fatigue, how they both were formed in the laboratory.
[00:55:39.705 --> 00:55:41.226]  This is a must-hear program.
[00:55:41.266 --> 00:55:44.448]  Then Michael Brown of the Michael Brown Solution, then Harry Brown.
[00:55:45.208 --> 00:55:50.591]  And Harry's going to be with us later on this afternoon on Alex Jones.
[00:55:50.671 --> 00:55:57.215]  We're talking with Paul Joseph Watson, author of Order Out of Chaos, the best book I have read all year.
[00:55:58.155 --> 00:56:02.157]  The elite-sponsored terrorism and New World Order tells you exactly what's going on.
[00:56:02.177 --> 00:56:03.838]  He's been holding on way too long.
[00:56:03.858 --> 00:56:05.399]  It's been Al from Texas.
[00:56:05.579 --> 00:56:06.299]  Alton, you're on.
[00:56:06.819 --> 00:56:09.280]  Hey, yeah, thanks for covering for Alex, both of you.
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.341]  We really appreciate you.
[00:56:10.881 --> 00:56:12.382]  And I had a couple of things.
[00:56:12.902 --> 00:56:25.508]  First of all, for you, Paul, what was your first impression when you heard of the supposed information on threats of terrorist attacks on our media?
[00:56:26.606 --> 00:56:28.047]  Did you have any gut feelings?
[00:56:29.227 --> 00:56:29.687]  Well, yeah.
[00:56:30.307 --> 00:56:31.467]  They came out with that.
[00:56:31.848 --> 00:56:36.669]  And it was tied in with the other information which came out, which was three years old, four years old.
[00:56:37.309 --> 00:56:52.473]  They came out with that threat to kowtow the media from, you know, taking any kind of in-depth coverage to the protests, and in particular the police brutality which was about to take place in New York, which primarily took place on a Tuesday night.
[00:56:52.493 --> 00:56:54.834]  So obviously, if you come out and say that the media
[00:56:55.254 --> 00:56:56.855]  The media might actually already be
[00:57:20.968 --> 00:57:26.092]  Hip to the idea that these people might do something to them under the guise of terrorism.
[00:57:27.413 --> 00:57:30.075]  I mean, we know about the agent provocateurs.
[00:57:30.375 --> 00:57:34.278]  We had reports Tuesday night about Black Block Anarchists.
[00:57:34.338 --> 00:57:38.221]  He wouldn't say which group they were affiliated with burning trash cans.
[00:57:38.601 --> 00:57:42.985]  So if anything like that is going to happen, then it's going to happen tonight.
[00:57:43.425 --> 00:57:44.706]  Well, it sounded to me like a setup.
[00:57:48.152 --> 00:57:52.254]  As a means to possibly eliminate media coverage from these events.
[00:57:52.794 --> 00:57:54.435]  For instance, take this scenario.
[00:57:55.035 --> 00:57:56.856]  Some provocateurs do get going.
[00:57:56.876 --> 00:57:59.357]  We get a few trash cans and thugs coming out.
[00:57:59.977 --> 00:58:07.380]  And then, coincidentally, at the same time, while all mayhem is breaking loose, a fox truck blows up.
[00:58:08.081 --> 00:58:12.483]  A couple media people get killed and they move all the media out to protect them for their own safety.
[00:58:13.203 --> 00:58:15.224]  And we have no media coverage whatsoever.
[00:58:15.846 --> 00:58:19.546]  And possibly media bans at further political gatherings.
[00:58:20.066 --> 00:58:21.406]  That was my own gut feeling.
[00:58:21.446 --> 00:58:22.627]  I thought, why would they do this?
[00:58:22.647 --> 00:58:25.287]  Why would they say that?
[00:58:25.507 --> 00:58:30.669]  Also, there have been 51 reporters dead now in Iraq.
[00:58:31.129 --> 00:58:32.129]  So there you've got it.
[00:58:32.169 --> 00:58:34.570]  They are doing anything they can to shut the media up.
[00:58:34.610 --> 00:58:35.790]  Thank you so much for the call.
[00:58:35.830 --> 00:58:40.531]  Steve, Dan, Aaron, we'll be back with you right after the top of the hour.
[00:58:40.731 --> 00:58:41.532]  Very short break.
[00:58:41.572 --> 00:58:42.312]  So hang on!
[00:58:42.652 --> 00:58:44.092]  Thanks for listening to Alex Jones.
[00:58:44.412 --> 00:58:46.833]  www.infowars.com
[00:58:57.999 --> 00:58:58.640]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.321 --> 00:59:00.362]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.083 --> 00:59:02.185]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.846 --> 00:59:03.667]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.428 --> 00:59:05.309]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.329 --> 00:59:09.715]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.175 --> 00:59:14.260]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:16.191]  We are live.
[00:59:16.211 --> 00:59:17.211]  This is Erskine City.
[00:59:17.251 --> 00:59:20.634]  And for Alex, the number here, 800-259-9231.
[00:59:21.795 --> 00:59:24.397]  My guest is Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:59:24.457 --> 00:59:28.780]  And Alex will be joining us at the 30 Mark to tell us what's going on in New York.
[00:59:29.301 --> 00:59:30.402]  Alex is also
[00:59:31.222 --> 00:59:34.565]  Also was on C-SPAN telling the truth.
[00:59:34.645 --> 00:59:36.707]  They weren't able to cut it.
[00:59:36.867 --> 00:59:37.948]  It was live.
[00:59:38.008 --> 00:59:41.250]  We heard that from Sherry that Alex was on C-SPAN.
[00:59:41.370 --> 00:59:46.595]  They let it get out on the national television telling the truth.
[00:59:46.815 --> 00:59:53.860]  And Al Allen from Texas just called and he was asking about what was going on regarding the reporters.
[00:59:53.941 --> 00:59:55.382]  Are they trying to silence them?
[00:59:55.982 --> 00:59:59.485]  Well, in Iraq, there have been 51 dead now.
[00:59:59.505 --> 01:00:01.867]  Of course, these are reporters who weren't embedded.
[01:00:02.547 --> 01:00:04.329]  And are they putting out warnings?
[01:00:04.369 --> 01:00:07.191]  Well, look what they did with the anthrax right after 9-11.
[01:00:07.211 --> 01:00:09.733]  Of course, they're putting out warnings to reporters.
[01:00:09.753 --> 01:00:12.575]  You follow the line or you're in real trouble.
[01:00:13.616 --> 01:00:15.297]  Paul, isn't that their tactic?
[01:00:15.337 --> 01:00:17.359]  They can't allow the truth to come out, can they?
[01:00:18.079 --> 01:00:24.625]  Well, no, and the Iraq analogy is key because before they went into Najaf and, you know, bombed it to bits.
[01:00:26.567 --> 01:00:40.241]  They said to the journalists you'd leave or you'd be executed and that's the same policy they've been following right from before the war even started when they said that in a BBC report this came out that the Pentagon had given the order to
[01:00:41.909 --> 01:00:46.414]  Fire down upon independent journalists who were reporting from Iraq.
[01:00:46.494 --> 01:01:03.832]  The policy was to kill any independent journalists, which is why we saw a wave of death of independent journalists in Iraq, like the Reuters photographer who stumbled across a mass grave that was being used to bury US troops, so the casualty numbers wouldn't get back to the public in America.
[01:01:04.392 --> 01:01:12.038]  So, um, that's the process that they went through in Iraq right from the start, and the tactic that the caller mentioned could indeed be used.
[01:01:12.078 --> 01:01:32.894]  I mean, on Monday, we had, um, the filmmakers who were making a film about a protest, and the police came up and arrested the, um, characters in the film, the fictional characters in the film, for wearing, um, bandanas, while they'll let all these, um, provocative black bloc anarchists who wear full face masks go free.
[01:01:35.137 --> 01:01:37.100]  Well, there's another issue, Paul.
[01:01:37.581 --> 01:01:41.066]  They're saying that the protesters there, they're anarchists.
[01:01:41.087 --> 01:01:42.188]  They're all anarchists.
[01:01:42.489 --> 01:01:43.991]  They aren't all anarchists.
[01:01:44.031 --> 01:01:45.574]  How are they getting by with that one?
[01:01:46.832 --> 01:01:57.079]  Well, there's a wide spectrum of protesters, but to label them as anarchists and troublemakers will obviously lead to the justification of the crackdown that then ensues.
[01:01:57.139 --> 01:02:09.567]  I mean, I don't agree with many of the issues that these protesters are campaigning about, but the bottom line is the First Amendment, and that's being squashed in New York, and they're creating the pretext for even more police state in later protests.
[01:02:09.587 --> 01:02:12.149]  So, I mean, it's obvious to see what's going on.
[01:02:13.542 --> 01:02:15.383]  You're opposed to the police state.
[01:02:15.503 --> 01:02:16.804]  You want to make a difference.
[01:02:16.824 --> 01:02:18.225]  You're opposed to terrorism.
[01:02:18.265 --> 01:02:19.125]  You want to fight it.
[01:02:19.506 --> 01:02:21.387]  Then you've got to get the message out.
[01:02:21.827 --> 01:02:30.132]  You've got to tell people to turn on the radio and listen to the Alex Jones Show just for a week or two and then tell us what you think.
[01:02:30.512 --> 01:02:31.893]  Listen to Alex Jones.
[01:02:31.953 --> 01:02:34.575]  Listen to my program, Erskine Overnight.
[01:02:35.055 --> 01:02:40.609]  But listen to the Genesis programs and you will begin to appreciate what's going on.
[01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:43.517]  Also get a copy of American Dictators.
[01:02:44.258 --> 01:02:46.079]  The staged election of 2004.
[01:02:46.979 --> 01:02:57.043]  Police State 1, Police State 2, Police State 3 are videos that Alex has put forward on Police State 1, 2, and 3 and the Matrix of Evil.
[01:02:57.123 --> 01:02:59.183]  You'll find out what's happening.
[01:02:59.844 --> 01:03:02.364]  Give those videos to your friends.
[01:03:02.464 --> 01:03:07.406]  If you don't have a copy of it, if you do have a copy, get it out and play it.
[01:03:07.506 --> 01:03:12.208]  When someone goes over the house, you say, hey look, here's something I think you might like to see or
[01:03:13.129 --> 01:03:16.650]  Give it to them and say, I want it back, but here's a copy of it.
[01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:18.591]  Look at this and tell me what you think.
[01:03:18.631 --> 01:03:21.052]  I've got a friend who makes 30 copies of everything.
[01:03:21.632 --> 01:03:24.953]  Alex says, go ahead, do it, because he wants the information out.
[01:03:24.993 --> 01:03:27.994]  Let's go immediately to my friend, Steve, listening up in Colorado.
[01:03:28.034 --> 01:03:30.015]  Steve, welcome to Alex Jones.
[01:03:30.395 --> 01:03:31.995]  Yeah, hey there, Riskin.
[01:03:32.015 --> 01:03:33.796]  Haven't talked to you for a long time.
[01:03:34.614 --> 01:03:43.249]  No, it looks like we're going to take a short break, Steve, but as soon as we get back, you are on absolutely as soon as we get back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:03:43.289 --> 01:03:44.431]  Good to hear from you, Steve.
[01:03:44.531 --> 01:03:46.214]  Hang on now, we'll be right back with you.
[01:03:53.502 --> 01:03:57.864]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:58.044 --> 01:04:02.467]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.607 --> 01:04:06.990]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:04:07.090 --> 01:04:08.411]  A New World Order.
[01:04:09.111 --> 01:04:10.052]  Panama.
[01:04:10.173 --> 01:04:14.377]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.457 --> 01:04:21.405]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.505 --> 01:04:23.548]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.888 --> 01:04:34.356]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.517 --> 01:04:39.901]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:04:54.872 --> 01:05:00.615]  You know that murky water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:05:00.875 --> 01:05:06.018]  The murky light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:05:06.338 --> 01:05:15.662]  The self-sterilizing black murky elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.

[01:05:58.876 --> 01:06:02.317]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.

[01:06:53.224 --> 01:06:58.287]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.607 --> 01:07:00.909]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:04.003 --> 01:07:05.804]  Indeed, there is a war on to your mind.
[01:07:05.824 --> 01:07:07.745]  This is Erskine sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:07:08.285 --> 01:07:11.787]  My program's ErskineOnRadio.com.
[01:07:11.987 --> 01:07:13.668]  The program's called Erskine Overnight.
[01:07:14.589 --> 01:07:17.791]  Get in touch with me, just write to me at ErskineOnRadio.com.
[01:07:17.891 --> 01:07:25.915]  And coming up on the 11th of September, there's a propitious day, September 11th at 1030 Pacific Time,
[01:07:26.579 --> 01:07:28.161]  I think it's 1.30 a.m.
[01:07:28.281 --> 01:07:28.982]  East Coast time.
[01:07:29.022 --> 01:07:33.507]  You better turn your lights off, otherwise they'll think you're up to something bad and your neighbors could get you in trouble!
[01:07:33.807 --> 01:07:43.898]  But you can turn on your computer, you can listen to your radio station, because Paul Joseph Watson will be on with me for an hour and a half, and you're more than welcome to call in.
[01:07:44.662 --> 01:08:00.305]  Also this week on the program, the very first hour at midnight East Coast time, we're having Donald Scott and he's going to talk about the real origin of AIDS and chronic fatigue, how it came out of our own government's research program.
[01:08:00.365 --> 01:08:03.025]  It's going to be a fascinating program.
[01:08:03.085 --> 01:08:06.006]  And then the last hour this week, we're having Harry Brown.
[01:08:06.146 --> 01:08:08.546]  My friend Steve in Colorado.
[01:08:09.346 --> 01:08:12.707]  Steve, you've got a question for Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:08:13.519 --> 01:08:15.221]  Yeah, hi there Erskine, how are you doing?
[01:08:15.861 --> 01:08:17.843]  I'm doing great, so good to hear from you again.
[01:08:17.923 --> 01:08:22.367]  This book, Order Out of Chaos, is one that if you haven't got it, you better get it.
[01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:23.568]  It's wonderful.
[01:08:24.368 --> 01:08:25.589]  Okay, alright.
[01:08:26.270 --> 01:08:38.821]  Yeah, I haven't actually got it yet, but my question for him was, if he remembers who it was on the, I think it was on your program, or I mean on Alex's program,
[01:08:41.632 --> 01:08:52.201]  It was mentioned that there was one of the speakers at the convention there that had mentioned that the Patriot Act was okay.
[01:08:52.401 --> 01:09:02.190]  They were trying to say from the podium there at the convention that the Patriot Act was not to be feared, etc.
[01:09:02.490 --> 01:09:05.153]  Was that you, Paul, that mentioned that?
[01:09:05.942 --> 01:09:06.943]  It wasn't me, no.
[01:09:07.403 --> 01:09:10.045]  I haven't actually been able to catch much of the speeches.
[01:09:10.065 --> 01:09:21.573]  It might have been our friend Arnold there, because he went into how, you know, it was a police state back in Austria, and how we're all so free in America today, you know, as the police outside are beating old ladies in the face.
[01:09:21.613 --> 01:09:23.735]  So, it might have been Arnie, I'm not sure.
[01:09:23.755 --> 01:09:24.996]  I see.
[01:09:25.256 --> 01:09:25.716]  Okay.
[01:09:26.357 --> 01:09:26.677]  Right.
[01:09:26.757 --> 01:09:32.081]  Well, you know, the sad thing is that the Rockefeller wing of the Republican Party
[01:09:32.948 --> 01:09:38.075]  Which are today's neocons that have finally taken over the Republican Party.
[01:09:38.135 --> 01:09:43.162]  The true Republicans have been kind of basically ostracized and squelched.
[01:09:43.997 --> 01:09:58.641]  Well, those of us like myself who believed in a smaller government, who believed in a government responsible, a government out of the people's bedrooms, out of everything, let us do our own thing.
[01:09:59.181 --> 01:10:04.182]  The conservative, as I grew up thinking I was conservative, we're gone!
[01:10:04.342 --> 01:10:05.643]  We no longer have a place!
[01:10:07.103 --> 01:10:09.246]  Government fiscal responsibility.
[01:10:09.306 --> 01:10:09.826]  We're gone.
[01:10:09.866 --> 01:10:11.508]  There's no place for us in the party.
[01:10:11.568 --> 01:10:14.211]  Pat Buchanan wrote an excellent article about that, Steve.
[01:10:14.792 --> 01:10:24.863]  Yeah, that's the unfortunate truth is that the true Republicans have been successfully squelched.
[01:10:25.203 --> 01:10:26.905]  So now we have all the neocons.
[01:10:27.475 --> 01:10:34.600]  That are basically controlled by the same people that are controlling the Democrat Party, and it's really pretty sad.
[01:10:35.381 --> 01:10:37.282]  Yeah, which skull and bones do you want to vote for?
[01:10:37.322 --> 01:10:38.824]  Let's go to Dan in Texas.
[01:10:38.884 --> 01:10:40.105]  Thanks for the call, Steve.
[01:10:40.625 --> 01:10:42.687]  Dan, welcome to the Alex Jones Program.
[01:10:42.927 --> 01:10:45.629]  Hey, Erskine, Paul, how are y'all?
[01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:46.670]  Great and wonderful.
[01:10:46.690 --> 01:10:47.530]  What about you, Dan?
[01:10:47.550 --> 01:10:49.171]  You got a question for Paul?
[01:10:49.452 --> 01:10:50.532]  Yes, I do.
[01:10:51.393 --> 01:10:55.076]  Paul, I'm a Prison Planet TV subscriber.
[01:10:55.982 --> 01:10:59.223]  And anyone out there listening who is not, needs to be.
[01:10:59.843 --> 01:11:04.204]  If they're spending $50 a month on regular cable TV, they're wasting their money.
[01:11:07.905 --> 01:11:21.689]  Paul, what I wanted to ask you, I hate to ask this because it sounds like a special request, but I'm an attorney and through Sunday through Wednesday I was very involved in a trial.
[01:11:22.595 --> 01:11:34.786]  And was not able to catch any of Alex's reports from New York either during the 11 to 2 section or when it was repeated later in the evening from 9 to midnight.
[01:11:35.426 --> 01:11:42.192]  Is there any chance that maybe by the weekend those could be archived on Prison Planet TV so I could see them?
[01:11:43.117 --> 01:11:43.738]  Yes, certainly.
[01:11:44.519 --> 01:11:48.703]  I put one up, which was the August 31st, which was a couple of days ago.
[01:11:49.484 --> 01:11:54.348]  Obviously I'm going to put today's up because Alex will be talking about his C-Span appearance.
[01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:59.573]  So then I'll throw in the other two as well, the one from Monday and the one from Friday.
[01:11:59.634 --> 01:12:02.937]  So yes, they will all be archived on the website by the weekend.
[01:12:03.490 --> 01:12:03.810]  Okay.
[01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:05.131]  I sure appreciate that.
[01:12:05.931 --> 01:12:07.732]  All you gotta do is ask for it, Dan.
[01:12:07.832 --> 01:12:08.913]  I appreciate the call.
[01:12:08.993 --> 01:12:13.135]  Thank you so much, and thanks for subscribing to The Prison Planet.
[01:12:13.215 --> 01:12:15.896]  Let's go immediately to Darren in Colorado.
[01:12:15.936 --> 01:12:16.396]  Darren?
[01:12:17.217 --> 01:12:18.057]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:12:19.418 --> 01:12:26.001]  I have a perception I'd like to put forth to your guest there.
[01:12:26.261 --> 01:12:29.263]  When the Constitution was written, it was written for the people's good.
[01:12:30.163 --> 01:12:31.384]  And that's the way laws should be.
[01:12:32.638 --> 01:12:38.260]  And now, if there's a weakness that can be made stronger, then we're allowed to do that.
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:51.544]  Under the Constitution, what it does is it gives us freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom to defend that assembly, to challenge authority in case we think they're taking your and my loved one's future away from us.
[01:12:52.984 --> 01:13:02.027]  But the people in their heart who are in the government know that the police are going to be sent against that assembly, even though they're in agreement with you.
[01:13:02.987 --> 01:13:07.493]  The mother would be against it, whose son is in the military, who would later be sent against it.
[01:13:07.513 --> 01:13:13.521]  It's against the ATF, FBI, CIA, who would be sent against that assembly, even if they're in agreement.
[01:13:14.703 --> 01:13:20.331]  And so, in that perception, those same people would want the public disarmed.
[01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:23.551]  Well, of course they would.
[01:13:23.631 --> 01:13:34.164]  I think they put the Second Amendment in the Constitution, not to protect you from a bank robber, or not to protect you from somebody breaking into your house, but to protect you from the government.
[01:13:34.184 --> 01:13:41.313]  The Constitution was written, as I read the Constitution, to keep the government in check.
[01:13:41.693 --> 01:13:46.236]  To keep the government in check, because your rights come from God, not from the government.
[01:13:46.296 --> 01:13:56.003]  That was the key, and that's what made our Constitutional form, our Constitutional Republic so beautiful, is that your rights are guaranteed by God, they're not given to you by the government.
[01:13:56.023 --> 01:14:09.072]  So what I would like to do is try to strengthen that just a little bit with a little more commentary, and that's that these same people, okay, when they, now when they're standing in a line as an individual,
[01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:20.098]  Among 500 others, and they think they're the only ones that think the way they do, that they're against what's going on, but they're forced to do that to keep their paycheck and the roof over their children's head.
[01:14:21.059 --> 01:14:31.888]  So, yes, we change our motives to where we feel that these police officers, when they're told to do something they know is wrong, they need a refuge.
[01:14:31.948 --> 01:14:38.173]  So if we change our motives in direction to make sure that our police have a refuge at home,
[01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:46.347]  And we all work toward that refuge at home to where we make sure we're loving our next door neighbors, ourselves, doing the good deeds to become bonded.
[01:14:46.447 --> 01:14:50.651]  So we give these people at refuge ATF, FBI, CIA.
[01:14:51.432 --> 01:14:57.617]  If we work toward that, then these same government people would want you armed to make sure their family is safe.
[01:14:58.058 --> 01:15:01.781]  You're no longer a threat because of the message you're sending out.
[01:15:02.542 --> 01:15:04.644]  Which it states the motives we're really after.
[01:15:05.672 --> 01:15:12.414]  And so, in that sense, it is a form of unity, but it's for the good of everybody.
[01:15:12.594 --> 01:15:25.318]  Now, it makes it to where those same people feel that a rescue is on the way, and that if they are being told to do something they know is wrong, what other place do they need to feel safe than at home?
[01:15:25.799 --> 01:15:32.701]  You have millions of listeners, and if we all work toward getting that refuge established for each of these people,
[01:15:33.427 --> 01:15:35.888]  We're good people who work within the government.
[01:15:36.849 --> 01:15:43.853]  It would actually bring it to where the injustice of staying against these people who would be sent against that assembly.
[01:15:44.433 --> 01:15:46.714]  Okay, I don't know how I feel about that.
[01:15:46.754 --> 01:15:47.775]  How do you feel, Paul?
[01:15:48.855 --> 01:15:51.837]  Well, I mean, the bottom line is, yeah, we need to educate the police, but
[01:15:52.772 --> 01:15:58.197]  The big question is, you know, how extreme do the orders have to get before the police say no?
[01:15:58.757 --> 01:16:10.988]  And in one sense you say that, yeah, police are good individuals, especially if we educate them on a grassroots level, but then on the flip side there have been psychological experiments throughout the decades which show that
[01:16:11.628 --> 01:16:16.252]  Any instruction from authority is obeyed under the right conditions.
[01:16:16.312 --> 01:16:36.529]  I mean there was the famous experiment where people were said to have been giving electric shocks to other participants in the experiment and they were told to give an electric shock which would normally kill the other person and the vast majority gave the electric shock which shows that the human submissiveness to authority
[01:16:36.949 --> 01:16:38.010]  Thanks for the call, Darren.
[01:17:06.592 --> 01:17:07.752]  A couple of other things.
[01:17:08.013 --> 01:17:15.695]  You had the Guy Cunningham report that came out of 29 Palms with the Marines fire on Americans and that wasn't a very pleasant report.
[01:17:15.735 --> 01:17:23.477]  The other thing that I noticed is when you're talking about the police, they're taking police and they are now deputizing them as U.S.
[01:17:23.677 --> 01:17:26.218]  Marshals so that they will be under the
[01:17:26.938 --> 01:17:31.624]  Patriot Act and able to operate under all of the auspices of the Patriot Act.
[01:17:31.644 --> 01:17:34.868]  So your local police are very rapidly disappearing.
[01:17:35.168 --> 01:17:35.509]  Bam!
[01:17:35.589 --> 01:17:35.849]  Boom!
[01:17:35.889 --> 01:17:36.910]  They're being deputized.
[01:17:36.930 --> 01:17:37.751]  They're now U.S.
[01:17:37.811 --> 01:17:38.192]  Marshals.
[01:17:38.472 --> 01:17:42.217]  The man may still have or lady may still have a badge saying I'm
[01:17:42.837 --> 01:17:49.942]  A police officer in Utica, New York, I'm a police officer in Austin, Texas, but they now are also U.S.
[01:17:50.043 --> 01:17:50.523]  Marshals.
[01:17:50.943 --> 01:18:04.373]  The other thing that I noticed in Phoenix, they have the Department of Justice, FBI, and the Sheriff of Maricopa County, and they put out a document called, if you encounter any of the following, the Joint Terrorism Task Force.
[01:18:04.873 --> 01:18:10.778]  Among those that you should watch out for are anybody who says they have Christian identity,
[01:18:14.812 --> 01:18:16.053]  Well, that would be a lot of us.
[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:26.941]  Hmm, that would be a bunch of us.
[01:18:27.501 --> 01:18:28.881]  Lone individuals?
[01:18:29.422 --> 01:18:30.962]  Hmm, that could be some of us.
[01:18:31.522 --> 01:18:34.023]  All of these you were supposed to call the FBI.
[01:18:34.063 --> 01:18:36.064]  This is what they were going for.
[01:18:36.244 --> 01:18:37.845]  This is what they are going for.
[01:18:37.945 --> 01:18:43.007]  So, when it comes to be nice to your police, certainly be nice to them, but let's use some common sense.
[01:18:43.067 --> 01:18:43.967]  We'll be back, 800-259-9231.
[01:18:44.027 --> 01:18:45.047]  Paul, I couldn't miss our guest.
[01:18:54.002 --> 01:18:56.364]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:18:56.605 --> 01:19:00.449]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:19:00.769 --> 01:19:01.590]  Read the labels.
[01:19:02.010 --> 01:19:06.154]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:19:06.374 --> 01:19:10.559]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:19:10.939 --> 01:19:15.804]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:19:16.184 --> 01:19:19.725]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Calbem Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:19:19.945 --> 01:19:25.287]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:19:25.567 --> 01:19:28.287]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:19:28.588 --> 01:19:29.488]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:19:53.732 --> 01:20:01.639]  Skyrocketing oil prices, the economy on the brink, the plunging dollar, terrorism, the government spending $1.80 for every dollar it collects.

[01:21:02.527 --> 01:21:03.808]  You don't have to pay them off.
[01:21:04.048 --> 01:21:05.429]  The banks are defrauding you.
[01:21:05.709 --> 01:21:07.050]  Now is the time to fight back.

[01:21:49.116 --> 01:21:50.457]  You lose nothing but the debt.
[01:21:52.495 --> 01:21:53.475]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:21:53.555 --> 01:21:58.336]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:21:58.496 --> 01:22:06.318]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:22:06.578 --> 01:22:11.939]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:22:12.139 --> 01:22:19.141]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:22:19.421 --> 01:22:24.765]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:22:25.025 --> 01:22:29.748]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:22:30.108 --> 01:22:37.733]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:22:38.053 --> 01:22:43.516]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:22:44.597 --> 01:22:45.638]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:45.658 --> 01:22:45.858]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:45.878 --> 01:22:48.600]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:13.257 --> 01:23:16.480]  Yes, it's the T-Rex of the political talk.
[01:23:16.761 --> 01:23:18.823]  It's the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[01:23:18.883 --> 01:23:20.284]  It's Erskine sitting in for Alex.
[01:23:20.865 --> 01:23:24.188]  And we're going immediately to the Volunteer State and Aaron.
[01:23:24.588 --> 01:23:29.653]  Aaron, you're on with Paul Joseph Watson, author of Order Out of Chaos.
[01:23:30.254 --> 01:23:32.176]  Thanks for having me on, guys.
[01:23:32.196 --> 01:23:32.877]  More than welcome.
[01:23:33.277 --> 01:23:34.919]  I've been listening for about three months now.
[01:23:35.521 --> 01:23:52.172]  And I just want to know, how is it right for the government to profile people who stay up past 1 or to question the government, but not to profile people coming in across our borders if the so-called terrorists came across the borders, came from out of the country?
[01:23:54.199 --> 01:23:56.821]  Well, let me say this.
[01:23:57.361 --> 01:24:19.118]  We've done a lot of programs, as Alex has done a lot of programs, and you've heard on Erskine Overnight, you've heard on Alex Jones about the illegal aliens coming across, and how there are virtually no restraints and no issues, the number that are coming across and piling into America, estimated to be, what is it, 15 million or more that are in?
[01:24:19.798 --> 01:24:20.659]  And, I mean,
[01:24:21.503 --> 01:24:28.385]  They have had people coming over who are of various extracts, not just Mexican, but various extracts.
[01:24:28.825 --> 01:24:31.325]  You've got truckers who are now going throughout America.
[01:24:31.385 --> 01:24:38.547]  Truck drivers should be up in arms about what's happening to the trucks coming across from Mexico.
[01:24:39.888 --> 01:24:40.628]  Profiling?
[01:24:40.888 --> 01:24:43.849]  Yeah, I think they ought to certainly be looking at it.
[01:24:43.929 --> 01:24:47.109]  We ought to maintain borders in America first.
[01:24:47.489 --> 01:24:49.450]  Your comment on what he was talking about, Paul?
[01:24:50.143 --> 01:24:54.146]  Well yeah, as I've been talking about throughout the show, the real threats are ignored.
[01:24:54.166 --> 01:24:58.330]  The terrorists coming across the borders is the main threat.
[01:24:58.370 --> 01:25:02.293]  Another big threat is arming of China.
[01:25:03.474 --> 01:25:06.657]  Republicans during Clinton's re-election campaign
[01:25:07.819 --> 01:25:16.902]  Um, Craig Fowle, that, you know, he was using arms to China to fund his campaign, and many of the whistleblowers who spoke out against it, like Ron Brown, were killed for doing so.
[01:25:17.342 --> 01:25:25.565]  But now I've posted an article on PrisonPlanet.com with the headline, Bush Administration Removes Barriers on Sale of Nuke Reactors to China.
[01:25:26.125 --> 01:25:39.773]  And now officially all the sanctions, all the controls, all the barriers have been taking off exporting nuclear components to China because now apparently it's okay to trust China that they won't use the technology for weapons proliferation.
[01:25:40.613 --> 01:25:43.095]  Oh no, they won't use the weapons, right.
[01:25:43.275 --> 01:25:44.896]  Ask North Korea, etc.
[01:25:44.956 --> 01:25:50.079]  And also, you know, we can't afford to make China too upset or Walmart won't have anything to sell.
[01:25:52.285 --> 01:25:55.809]  Well, it's the same country, China, that's increasing military expenditure.
[01:25:56.209 --> 01:25:58.292]  You know, military build-up, 9% a year.
[01:25:58.732 --> 01:26:06.240]  And over the last few months, we've carried articles which lay out China's stated intention to invade Taiwan within the next two years.
[01:26:06.761 --> 01:26:11.987]  And the Bush administration's response has basically been, you know, go right ahead, we'll do nothing to stop you.
[01:26:13.148 --> 01:26:27.960]  In the face of them hyping the threat from Iran and North Korea, as you mentioned, their development of the nuclear bomb, they're now shipping a shopping list of nuke parts to China, who have armed and continue to arm Iran and North Korea.
[01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:31.583]  Are they forgetting that it's still Communist China?
[01:26:32.751 --> 01:26:51.819]  Well, it's overtly communist, and it goes back to the old self-fulfilling prophecy, as I document, in order out of chaos, they're building up the enemies they need in preparation for a third world war, while introducing bills for a draft, because, as is contained in the Project for a New American Century documents,
[01:26:52.199 --> 01:26:52.519]  Make no mistake...
[01:27:14.548 --> 01:27:17.169]  Congressman Regal has proposed a bill.
[01:27:17.249 --> 01:27:18.649]  Senator Hollings has a bill.
[01:27:18.689 --> 01:27:21.029]  There are a number of bills about a draft.
[01:27:21.049 --> 01:27:23.390]  You're going to see that immediately after the election.
[01:27:23.850 --> 01:27:26.210]  Any other comments on that, Aaron?
[01:27:26.691 --> 01:27:27.171]  No, sir.
[01:27:27.211 --> 01:27:30.411]  You guys answered my questions, and I just want to say, keep up the good work.
[01:27:31.452 --> 01:27:32.012]  Thank you.
[01:27:32.112 --> 01:27:36.473]  Get yourself a copy of American Dictators, the state's election 2004.
[01:27:37.393 --> 01:27:38.533]  You'll see much more about it.
[01:27:38.573 --> 01:27:40.133]  Let's go to Fred in Pennsylvania.
[01:27:40.433 --> 01:27:42.334]  Fred, welcome to Alex Jones.
[01:27:42.574 --> 01:27:42.914]  Thank you.
[01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:51.196]  I want to mention about this Federal Grand Jury investigation of Richard Chaney.
[01:27:52.957 --> 01:28:03.505]  Oh yes, did you by any chance Fred see 60 Minutes Sunday Night when they had about the Halliburton doing the business in the Caymans and how many people work there?
[01:28:03.545 --> 01:28:07.929]  How many people would you think work in their Caymans office which is their main headquarters?
[01:28:07.989 --> 01:28:10.491]  Yeah, yeah I caught that.
[01:28:10.511 --> 01:28:10.671]  Zero!
[01:28:10.691 --> 01:28:13.313]  But I want to tie that into when Alex Jones
[01:28:14.368 --> 01:28:25.618]  Let's talk about that when we get back, Fred.
[01:28:25.698 --> 01:28:32.283]  I want you to hold on because this is really important to talk about Patriot 2 and Richard Cheney.
[01:28:32.363 --> 01:28:35.666]  We'll be right back after these very, very brief words.
[01:28:36.086 --> 01:28:36.887]  Fred, hang on.
[01:28:37.387 --> 01:28:37.808]  Hang on.
[01:28:37.868 --> 01:28:38.248]  Our number 800-259-9231.
[01:28:38.268 --> 01:28:40.210]  We will be joined with Alex very shortly.
[01:28:43.951 --> 01:28:46.934]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.954 --> 01:28:50.637]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:58.845]  We all have busy lives and sometimes that causes us to miss out on the things that are most important to us.
[01:28:59.365 --> 01:29:02.488]  Well, when it comes to Genesis programs, you'll never have to miss out again.
[01:29:03.143 --> 01:29:09.087]  For only $19.95 plus $3 shipping and handling, you can receive an entire month of recorded GCN programs.
[01:29:09.587 --> 01:29:13.209]  That's right, an entire month for only $19.95 plus shipping and handling.
[01:29:13.650 --> 01:29:16.311]  The recordings are in MP3 format and compact disc.
[01:29:16.752 --> 01:29:20.534]  They're playable on computers along with most newer CD and DVD players.
[01:29:21.014 --> 01:29:24.957]  All you need to know is the name of the program you'd like a copy of and the month that it aired.
[01:29:25.495 --> 01:29:28.797]  Don't be left out of current news and information that affects our lives every day.
[01:29:29.138 --> 01:29:34.682]  We all want to stay informed, so visit our website at GCNLive.com and click on the GCN Mall.
[01:29:35.182 --> 01:29:39.045]  Or call 877-996-4327, extension 150.
[01:29:39.185 --> 01:29:41.066]  It's easy and convenient.

[01:29:54.170 --> 01:29:55.771]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:55.911 --> 01:30:00.013]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:30:00.153 --> 01:30:03.035]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:03.115 --> 01:30:09.798]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:09.998 --> 01:30:13.020]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:13.221 --> 01:30:15.622]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:15.762 --> 01:30:35.077]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as actazine, benzene, chloride and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[01:30:35.357 --> 01:30:41.399]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:41.419 --> 01:30:41.679]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:30:41.699 --> 01:30:42.899]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:30:53.473 --> 01:30:56.296]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[01:30:56.437 --> 01:30:57.278]  Michael Trudeau here.
[01:30:57.398 --> 01:31:00.701]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[01:31:00.882 --> 01:31:06.548]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[01:31:06.688 --> 01:31:09.712]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[01:31:09.972 --> 01:31:14.233]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[01:31:14.433 --> 01:31:16.354]  The chronic, everyday pain was miserable.
[01:31:16.454 --> 01:31:23.516]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[01:31:23.716 --> 01:31:26.177]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[01:31:26.477 --> 01:31:29.159]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice.
[01:31:29.299 --> 01:31:30.801]  Only this time, it changed my life.
[01:31:31.101 --> 01:31:32.842]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement.
[01:31:32.942 --> 01:31:35.044]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[01:31:35.204 --> 01:31:37.666]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[01:31:37.726 --> 01:31:40.408]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[01:31:40.608 --> 01:31:41.129]  Side effects?
[01:31:41.309 --> 01:31:43.571]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[01:31:43.731 --> 01:31:45.232]  Call Kliscott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[01:31:45.252 --> 01:31:45.452]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[01:31:45.572 --> 01:31:46.873]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[01:31:46.893 --> 01:31:47.514]  It worked for me.
[01:31:54.346 --> 01:32:07.170]  Houston-based Kellogg Brown & Ruth was a Halliburton subsidiary when Mr. Cheney was president of Halliburton.
[01:32:07.190 --> 01:32:07.650]  They did
[01:32:14.833 --> 01:32:19.276]  The fine of 3.8 million dollars for exporting U.S.
[01:32:19.316 --> 01:32:21.477]  goods to Libya in violation of U.S.
[01:32:21.517 --> 01:32:22.858]  sanctions.
[01:32:23.338 --> 01:32:25.399]  Cheney did nothing to stop the fraud.
[01:32:25.759 --> 01:32:32.423]  Hal Burton's accountant, Arthur Anderson, the Enron-like accounting scheme under Cheney's watch.
[01:32:32.743 --> 01:32:38.187]  You've also got, well, we can just go on and on and on about the Cheney connection.
[01:32:38.227 --> 01:32:43.830]  The man who still believes the Al Qaeda connection to Saddam Hussein, or at least is telling everybody about that.
[01:32:44.370 --> 01:32:50.555]  And we're talking with a gentleman, Fred, who's got a lot to tell us, and go ahead, Fred.
[01:32:50.875 --> 01:33:13.811]  Okay, I want to say that I looked back at an Alex Jones article, Total Police Day Takeover, that's the title of his article, and he has mentioned, talks about Patriot 2, and he says, quote, Section 128 allows the federal government to place gag orders on federal
[01:33:14.378 --> 01:33:18.279]  and state grand juries and to take over the proceedings.
[01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:25.281]  It also disallows individuals or organizations to even try to quash a federal subpoena.
[01:33:26.142 --> 01:33:42.587]  So, you have an investigation and under Patriot II, the federal government can hijack a grand jury, which is supposed to be something that, you know,
[01:33:43.366 --> 01:33:44.227]  is independent.
[01:33:46.729 --> 01:33:48.151]  Oh, there's no question about that.
[01:33:48.211 --> 01:33:49.372]  Paul, you got a comment on it?
[01:33:49.932 --> 01:33:51.914]  Well, yeah, just to add something else.
[01:33:51.974 --> 01:34:01.343]  I mean, the myth peddled by the establishment media is that Cheney, as we know, he's resigned from Albert and several years ago, no longer makes money out of these deals.
[01:34:01.724 --> 01:34:05.267]  When I've got a London Guardian article from March 1203,
[01:34:06.648 --> 01:34:10.250]  Cheney is still paid by Pentagon contractor Halliburton.
[01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:24.716]  The Texas company which has been awarded the Pentagon's contract to put out potential oil field fires in Iraq and which is bidding for post-war construction contracts is still making annual payments to its former chief executive, the Vice President Dick Cheney.
[01:34:25.097 --> 01:34:33.801]  The payments which appear on Mr. Cheney's 2001 financial disclosure statement are in the form of deferred compensation of up to $1 million a year
[01:34:34.982 --> 01:34:42.497]  So that myth that he's not involved with it anymore is defeated by the fact that they're still making annual payments to him.
[01:34:44.022 --> 01:34:56.888]  So he's still making money from Halliburton, and you've not only got that, but you've also got selling goods now, according to 60 Minutes, to Iran, selling goods to other nations that they say are promoting terrorism.
[01:34:57.368 --> 01:35:03.051]  This is tantamount to what Prescott Bush did, and Paul, what did Prescott Bush do?
[01:35:03.271 --> 01:35:08.213]  I mean, this is in your order out of chaos, wasn't he one of the people who financed Adolf Hitler?
[01:35:09.065 --> 01:35:19.178]  Well yeah, he ran the steel and many of the bombings which took place in Germany focused away from the kind of factories where the bush money was rested.
[01:35:19.238 --> 01:35:23.063]  So he did arm Hitler and he funded Hitler's war machine to a massive degree.
[01:35:23.123 --> 01:35:26.187]  So it's just a continuation of that kind of policy.
[01:35:26.907 --> 01:35:33.172]  So you had Prescott Bush doing the same thing that Dick Cheney's doing, so you can see the similarity there.
[01:35:33.613 --> 01:35:41.319]  Neither one, and both of them, are coming down with the Patriot Bills, and we have fewer and fewer openings with the government.
[01:35:41.359 --> 01:35:55.351]  These Patriot Bills make the government more enclosed, makes us, we've lost our privacy, the government has encompassed itself in a cocoon of paperwork to where you can't find out what's going on anymore.
[01:35:55.811 --> 01:35:56.691]  What's been happening?
[01:35:56.831 --> 01:36:05.114]  Erskine, I wanted to ask, what does Paul know about this sound weapon?
[01:36:05.154 --> 01:36:17.739]  Because I caught some footage of a demonstration and it sounded like a high-pitched sound.
[01:36:18.239 --> 01:36:20.520]  Very perceptive of you, yes.
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:23.821]  There are reports of that being used in New York, aren't there Paul?
[01:36:24.525 --> 01:36:36.010]  Yeah, it's a white police armoured Humvee vehicle which on it is mounted this acoustic sound weapon which puts out decibels at high levels to disperse large numbers of people.
[01:36:36.430 --> 01:36:41.912]  And I had reports Tuesday night that they rolled it into Union Square.
[01:36:42.332 --> 01:36:53.517]  I don't think they actually used it, it was just a kind of fear device, but as the protests are set to escalate tonight during Bush's speech, there is a possibility that they will use it tonight.
[01:36:55.408 --> 01:36:56.269]  Absolutely right.
[01:36:56.369 --> 01:36:57.070]  Thanks a lot.
[01:36:57.230 --> 01:36:58.391]  I appreciate the phone call.
[01:36:58.431 --> 01:36:59.571]  Let's go to Nick in Texas.
[01:36:59.652 --> 01:37:02.294]  Nick, you're on Alex Jones' radio program.
[01:37:03.054 --> 01:37:08.739]  You mentioned earlier a story about how they're federally deputizing police so that they're going to fall under the Patriot Act.
[01:37:09.339 --> 01:37:09.619]  Yes.
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:18.987]  I know a prison guard in a minimum security prison here in Central Texas and about three weeks ago he told me that they were going to be federally deputized and I asked him why.
[01:37:19.547 --> 01:37:23.350]  At the time he insinuated it was so the Bush administration could claim that they put
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:30.104]  X amount of more police on the street by reclassifying these prison guards as federal deputies.
[01:37:30.884 --> 01:37:34.727]  And now it seems that perhaps it would be so that they would fall under the Patriot Act.
[01:37:35.387 --> 01:37:44.513]  And I'm just curious what the implication is with all these duly deputized federal employees falling under the Patriot Act.
[01:37:45.131 --> 01:38:04.710]  So my way of thinking that by putting them under the Patriot Act standards where they can have greater powers and they are operating now as a federal police force, it's taking the control away from your local police and putting it in the hands of the federal police would be my thinking about it.
[01:38:04.770 --> 01:38:05.591]  What's yours, Paul?
[01:38:06.573 --> 01:38:27.275]  Well yeah, we had a story last night out of United Press International which talks about a fired prison guard in Chicago called John Burge who claimed 108 men, they claimed they were victims of torture, electric shock, suffocation and other abuse over the 20 years that Burge was in the police force.
[01:38:27.996 --> 01:38:30.960]  Those are the kind of people that they want to put out there on the streets.
[01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:36.788]  And I mean, again, this fusing the military with the police is because the military treat us as the enemy.
[01:38:36.828 --> 01:38:41.094]  The old definition of a peace officer that we help and he helps us is gone.
[01:38:41.154 --> 01:38:43.057]  We're now the enemy, which is why they're doing this.
[01:38:44.493 --> 01:38:46.915]  Preserve and protect is totally gone.
[01:38:47.095 --> 01:38:51.759]  The terms preserve and protect is totally gone and it is completely changed.
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:54.441]  Very good observation, Nick.
[01:38:54.481 --> 01:38:55.522]  I appreciate the call.
[01:38:55.843 --> 01:38:57.965]  Let's go immediately to Larry in Arizona.
[01:38:58.025 --> 01:38:58.765]  Larry, you're on.
[01:39:00.146 --> 01:39:06.032]  Alex Jones, this is Erskine, along with Paul Joseph Watson, author of Order Out of Chaos.
[01:39:06.432 --> 01:39:07.012]  Morning, gentlemen.
[01:39:07.733 --> 01:39:08.314]  Good morning.
[01:39:08.754 --> 01:39:09.455]  I'm glad that the
[01:39:10.137 --> 01:39:14.099]  The name Hitler came up before because I have a World War II question I'd like to address to Paul.
[01:39:15.179 --> 01:39:23.042]  And basically I'd like to have your take on the so-called Miracle at Dunkirk and Hess's secret mission to London.
[01:39:23.142 --> 01:39:24.142]  What's your take on that, Paul?
[01:39:25.203 --> 01:39:26.343]  The Miracle at Dunkirk?
[01:39:26.443 --> 01:39:28.444]  Is that where the Ghost Army appeared?
[01:39:28.464 --> 01:39:29.344]  I'm not sure about that.
[01:39:29.885 --> 01:39:38.708]  That's the one where the British Army was, after France was routed by the Germans, the British Army was stuck there on the beach at Dunkirk.
[01:39:39.457 --> 01:39:47.442]  The Germans could have destroyed them, but they let them go, and all of the boats, fishing boats, whatever, came from England and escorted the English Army back to England.
[01:39:47.882 --> 01:39:49.123]  Let them continue fighting the war.
[01:39:49.143 --> 01:39:53.425]  I haven't researched that in any depth, so I can't really comment on that.
[01:39:54.205 --> 01:39:55.426]  And your second question?
[01:39:56.347 --> 01:39:58.748]  About Rudolf Hess' secret mission to London.
[01:39:58.828 --> 01:40:01.950]  If you have any inside information about that, what that might have been about.
[01:40:02.765 --> 01:40:29.571]  Yeah, I mean obviously that was right before the war started and it was a reconciliation agreement in Britain around half of the Royal Family I think and this later came out in reports which we covered over the last couple of years around half of the British Royal Family wanted to go ahead and accept that agreement and appease Hitler because obviously the British Royal Family, their genealogical roots tie in with Hitler and the Sachs-Kohlbergs so
[01:40:30.211 --> 01:40:39.974]  There was a movement amongst the British Royals to appease Hitler right before the war started, so that's what was going on with the Hess visit, but obviously Churchill rejected it.
[01:40:40.834 --> 01:40:44.856]  I thought that happened in 1941 when the war was already going on, and then they locked him up instead.
[01:40:46.356 --> 01:40:48.417]  I think it happened in 1941.
[01:40:48.477 --> 01:40:55.759]  I think there were also efforts at appeasement right before the war started, so I think there's at least two examples where that kind of thing happened.
[01:40:56.391 --> 01:41:01.053]  You have to also look at the situation when the United States declared independence from Great Britain in 1776.
[01:41:02.714 --> 01:41:10.137]  King George back then, hmm, George again, well, King George back then didn't even speak English, he spoke German.
[01:41:10.877 --> 01:41:15.059]  Okay, let's go immediately to, uh, let's see, who is it?
[01:41:15.959 --> 01:41:16.599]  In Illinois?
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:17.580]  Is this Bob?
[01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:18.400]  Robert?
[01:41:20.001 --> 01:41:20.301]  Hello?
[01:41:21.181 --> 01:41:21.542]  Robert?
[01:41:21.722 --> 01:41:22.502]  Yeah, Erskine.
[01:41:23.211 --> 01:41:23.571]  Yes!
[01:41:23.812 --> 01:41:52.474]  First of all, the answer to the last question, the quote-unquote miracle at Dunkirk, there's an excellent explanation in that, in Jackie Petrou's Sweet Liberty website, and what Hitler's purpose was, is that if someone comes to understand it, Hitler was trying to prevent the Bolsheviks, which really was the Russian movement westward, was nothing more than the expansion of the International Revolution of 1917 from Russia to all of Western Europe,
[01:41:53.024 --> 01:42:03.734]  And Hitler recognized, he said, quote unquote, there's two entities whose presence and activity is indispensably necessary to the stability of the world, and that is the British Empire and the Catholic Church.
[01:42:04.115 --> 01:42:07.218]  And so he had an interest, he was trying to ally with Britain
[01:42:07.865 --> 01:42:23.581]  Against the Russian expansion into all of Europe, which was phase number two of the International Revolution, which anyone who has read Prodigals of Elders of Zion and the Babylonian Talmud would understand that they couldn't take over the British Empire until they had taken over all of Europe, and that's the purpose.
[01:42:23.601 --> 01:42:28.967]  They financed Hitler to raise up a boogeyman as a pretext upon which the Russian horde
[01:42:29.437 --> 01:42:31.199]  So the same thing's happening today, okay.
[01:42:31.219 --> 01:42:31.299]  Okay.
[01:42:52.250 --> 01:43:03.536]  And we have Mayor Richard Daley, who's an absolutely abominable pro-genocide, gun control, rabid fanatic, and the other thing is he's imposing his morality on Alan Keyes.
[01:43:03.576 --> 01:43:14.703]  He's demanding Alan Keyes apologize for statements that were in no way argumentative or offensive to anyone when Alan Keyes merely explicated his religious position in regard to homosexuality.
[01:43:14.743 --> 01:43:17.124]  But I've been outside of the Mayor's
[01:43:17.799 --> 01:43:18.680]  I don't know.
[01:43:37.699 --> 01:43:43.183]  I'm wondering if anyone's read the article by Mike VanderWaal, what good is a handgun against an army?
[01:43:43.484 --> 01:43:57.514]  And I'm looking for material that I would read through the megaphone to the public outside of City Hall in Chicago, so that through rhetorical questioning and Socratic method, people can come to the conclusion themselves that they can't afford not
[01:44:01.065 --> 01:44:10.468]  Okay, let me give you a book and a person whom I would recommend to you.
[01:44:11.129 --> 01:44:15.990]  It is called Dial 911 and Die by Richard Stevens.
[01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:19.852]  It's how the police have no obligation to help you or anything else.
[01:44:19.952 --> 01:44:23.853]  And the other person that I would get in touch with is Aaron Zellman.
[01:44:24.734 --> 01:44:30.718]  A-A-R-O-N-C-E-L-M-A-N, and it's Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership.
[01:44:30.998 --> 01:44:31.639]  Very good.
[01:44:31.699 --> 01:44:32.199]  J-P-F-O.
[01:44:32.679 --> 01:44:38.483]  Good organization, and I think that's a person whom you would have a lot in common with and would really appreciate.
[01:44:38.543 --> 01:44:39.704]  I value him on my program.
[01:44:40.144 --> 01:44:44.407]  Wonderful person, and Richard Stevens dialed 911 and died.
[01:44:44.507 --> 01:44:46.728]  Lays the story out everywhere.
[01:44:46.748 --> 01:44:48.009]  They've taken over guns.
[01:44:48.329 --> 01:44:49.470]  They have killed the people.
[01:44:49.930 --> 01:44:50.930]  Two other quick questions.
[01:44:51.170 --> 01:44:52.931]  I'm wondering what the cameras are set up.
[01:44:52.971 --> 01:44:55.452]  There's got to be cameras on all the corners of those buildings.
[01:44:55.732 --> 01:45:10.876]  And if I should get falsely arrested in terms of preserving a civil rights claim against the police, because I'm going to do everything I can to get under Daley's skin and prevent him from getting away, Richard Daley, with the maintaining of the pretext that he is trying to do anything for the public's interest.
[01:45:10.916 --> 01:45:12.997]  Richard Daley has four or five bodyguards
[01:45:13.487 --> 01:45:20.453]  At the public expense, and yet in Chicago we can't even own any type of handgun, much less carry any type of weapon.
[01:45:20.473 --> 01:45:23.795]  The only thing you can own is a... Well, then that makes the city completely safe, doesn't it?
[01:45:23.815 --> 01:45:25.777]  You don't even need a bodyguard or anything.
[01:45:25.797 --> 01:45:27.659]  You have no drive-by shootings or anything.
[01:45:27.699 --> 01:45:31.442]  In Chicago, no hold-ups or anything, because you can't carry handguns.
[01:45:31.502 --> 01:45:33.543]  That should be the safest city in the world.
[01:45:33.603 --> 01:45:35.345]  The murder capital of the world, the cars.
[01:45:37.286 --> 01:45:48.190]  The other thing I was going to ask is real quick is if you would comment on, first of all, do you know in terms of what cameras, there's got to be cameras in all those city buildings, wouldn't that be a correct at this juncture?
[01:45:48.210 --> 01:45:54.152]  In other words, if I'm standing out on City Hall... You can always anticipate they've got cameras everywhere, Robert.
[01:45:54.192 --> 01:46:01.715]  You can anticipate that and one of the people who talks about the surveillance state that we're under is Paul Joseph Watson in Order Out of Chaos.
[01:46:01.775 --> 01:46:05.036]  Aren't we under complete surveillance anywhere you go more or less today?
[01:46:06.941 --> 01:46:09.483]  In London alone, there are 4.2 million cameras.
[01:46:09.883 --> 01:46:12.184]  So we've got a movement where there should be... Come on!
[01:46:12.284 --> 01:46:12.864]  How many?
[01:46:12.884 --> 01:46:15.186]  4.2 million cameras?
[01:46:15.606 --> 01:46:16.986]  That we know of, at least.
[01:46:17.747 --> 01:46:23.149]  So it's safe to conclude, then, if I do get... something happens to me on a city street around City Hall, there's definitely going to be film.
[01:46:23.210 --> 01:46:29.353]  I just have to go through the discovery process of a federal lawsuit to... Oh yeah, there's film somewhere no matter what you do.
[01:46:29.433 --> 01:46:30.873]  Robert, thanks for the call.
[01:46:30.953 --> 01:46:31.534]  I appreciate it.
[01:46:31.574 --> 01:46:33.395]  Let's go to Dave in Colorado.
[01:46:33.895 --> 01:46:34.175]  Dave.
[01:46:36.744 --> 01:46:37.545]  How are you doing, Paul?
[01:46:39.046 --> 01:46:41.129]  Listen, I've got a couple of questions.
[01:46:41.329 --> 01:46:47.195]  One, I kind of wanted to know where I could catch Alex on C-SPAN.
[01:46:49.777 --> 01:46:59.487]  My second question was, I was watching a Republican convention and they had a senator from Georgia,
[01:47:00.997 --> 01:47:01.958]  Uh, standing up.
[01:47:01.978 --> 01:47:03.059]  Zell Miller, right.
[01:47:03.239 --> 01:47:06.521]  Yeah, he was praising the Republican Party and everything.
[01:47:06.581 --> 01:47:10.004]  And wouldn't that, wouldn't that... Has that ever happened before?
[01:47:10.104 --> 01:47:15.067]  I mean, it seems like the Democrats' jaws would have hit the ground on something.
[01:47:15.187 --> 01:47:16.088]  Oh, now wait a minute.
[01:47:16.108 --> 01:47:18.890]  You had Ron Reagan at the Democrat Party.
[01:47:21.778 --> 01:47:22.538]  Okay, yeah.
[01:47:42.750 --> 01:47:46.911]  Take Mayor Bloomberg as an example, before he became Mayor of New York.
[01:48:01.255 --> 01:48:06.100]  There were several reports of his funding of both the Democrat and Republican parties.
[01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:07.981]  Giuliani was the same.
[01:48:08.081 --> 01:48:14.127]  So, I mean, they cross over at will because, as we know, the rhetoric is different but the agenda in the two parties is the same.
[01:48:14.868 --> 01:48:19.071]  Regarding the first question about the C-SPAN thing, we're still waiting to get that.
[01:48:19.452 --> 01:48:21.734]  We've looked on the C-SPAN website and it's
[01:48:22.348 --> 01:48:39.839]  It's not on there as far as we've looked so we're asking for anyone who managed to take that to rip it into a media file and email it to me or if that's not possible then send a hard copy to Alex and then we'll be able to get it on the website within a few days so we're still trying to get that up.
[01:48:40.219 --> 01:48:44.362]  You betcha, the key to it is it was a live interview, am I right Paul?
[01:48:44.382 --> 01:48:46.583]  That was live, they weren't able to cut Alex!
[01:48:47.316 --> 01:48:53.162]  As far as I know, it was live, but as soon as he started talking about the New World Order, they cut the feed.
[01:48:53.262 --> 01:48:54.723]  So, I mean, that's what I heard.
[01:48:55.884 --> 01:48:57.446]  Let's go to Al in California.
[01:48:57.626 --> 01:48:57.806]  Al?
[01:48:57.826 --> 01:49:00.369]  Hi.
[01:49:01.530 --> 01:49:02.111]  Hi, Al.
[01:49:02.231 --> 01:49:05.514]  You got a question for Paul Joseph Watson, or do you have a comment?
[01:49:06.054 --> 01:49:06.995]  I have a question.
[01:49:07.015 --> 01:49:09.398]  Yeah, I've got a couple of questions.
[01:49:11.331 --> 01:49:12.032]  This one's for Paul.
[01:49:12.332 --> 01:49:19.737]  Do you know anything about Hitler's doubles and Saddam's doubles and the originals and what happened to them and where they are?
[01:49:19.757 --> 01:49:23.540]  Because I was reading a little bit on Hitler's doubles and Hitler himself.
[01:49:24.501 --> 01:49:25.302]  I don't know about Hitler.
[01:49:25.322 --> 01:49:33.908]  There were several reports that his double, or Hitler himself, was secreted away to Argentina after the war had ended, that he didn't actually die.
[01:49:34.088 --> 01:49:37.491]  And that was in the National Security Archive, so that's what I read about that.
[01:49:38.217 --> 01:49:39.360]  Let's get back.
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:40.302]  Hold on now.
[01:49:40.322 --> 01:49:44.894]  We'll be right back with you talking about doubles on Alex Jones!
[01:49:45.194 --> 01:49:46.859]  www.infowars.com
[01:49:53.780 --> 01:49:55.262]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.462 --> 01:49:58.546]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.686 --> 01:50:02.570]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.631 --> 01:50:06.876]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:07.216 --> 01:50:10.980]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.060 --> 01:50:12.943]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:13.203 --> 01:50:16.404]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[01:50:16.464 --> 01:50:21.166]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.326 --> 01:50:24.368]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.548 --> 01:50:27.409]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.909 --> 01:50:34.032]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.552 --> 01:50:38.355]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:50:53.164 --> 01:50:58.406]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:58.546 --> 01:51:06.628]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:06.888 --> 01:51:13.930]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:14.130 --> 01:51:15.411]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:51:15.491 --> 01:51:21.376]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:21.576 --> 01:51:26.660]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:35.648]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:35.908 --> 01:51:39.210]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:52:54.531 --> 01:52:57.293]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:52:57.833 --> 01:53:01.155]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:02.897 --> 01:53:05.138]  Crashing through the lies of disinformation.
[01:53:05.178 --> 01:53:07.359]  You better believe it's the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[01:53:07.399 --> 01:53:18.587]  This is Erskine sitting in for the one and only Alex Jones, along with my guest, Paul Joseph Watson, author of Order Out of Chaos.
[01:53:18.767 --> 01:53:20.728]  As always, let me give out some websites.
[01:53:21.048 --> 01:53:23.250]  www.infowars.com
[01:53:24.183 --> 01:53:47.547]  www.prisonplanet.com where you can get a copy of American Dictators the staged election of 2004 also police states 1, 2, and 3 those videos have come to fruition they're coming in very quickly and Matrix of Evil plus Paul Joseph Watson's amazing book Order Out of Chaos and one of the things that I noticed
[01:53:48.047 --> 01:53:58.243]  We're talking about what's happening with the state and talking about videos such as the Police State 1, 2, and 3 that Alex has put out.
[01:53:59.972 --> 01:54:02.614]  They've got a couple of reasons that they're doing these holding pins.
[01:54:02.854 --> 01:54:04.455]  One, you instill terror.
[01:54:04.836 --> 01:54:15.064]  Number two, you get people used to seeing a de facto militarization of the nation's cities with these security sweeps, holding pins, tanks, helicopter gunships, the whole thing.
[01:54:15.584 --> 01:54:18.706]  Matter of fact, they're even using the Fuji blimp overhead there.
[01:54:19.247 --> 01:54:21.989]  It's not for your security anymore.
[01:54:22.389 --> 01:54:25.471]  It has become security of the state.
[01:54:25.692 --> 01:54:28.454]  That is a very alarming development and
[01:54:29.174 --> 01:54:31.995]  Al was asking you about doubles.
[01:54:32.035 --> 01:54:35.776]  You explained that Hitler had a double that may have made it to Argentina.
[01:54:36.156 --> 01:54:38.297]  Saddam, I think, had 19 different doubles.
[01:54:38.497 --> 01:54:45.460]  I'm looking at pictures and other people have looked at pictures of President Bush with the Widow's Peak, without the Widow's Peak.
[01:54:45.900 --> 01:54:49.881]  It looks to me like he's using doubles with big ears, without big ears.
[01:54:50.301 --> 01:54:53.022]  Looks to me like they have doubles of President Bush.
[01:54:53.142 --> 01:54:55.243]  Or am I being too conspiratorial, Paul?
[01:54:56.323 --> 01:55:02.945]  I don't know about President Bush, but certainly we know that Saddam had several doubles before the war in Iraq started.
[01:55:02.985 --> 01:55:11.467]  Many people have pointed out that when he was captured, his beard had grown several inches within the space of a few months, which was impossible.
[01:55:11.747 --> 01:55:19.290]  His hair was dyed jet black, so he was supposed to be in this hole, and yet he had a plentiful supply of hair dye.
[01:55:19.370 --> 01:55:20.850]  People have looked at the photographs
[01:55:21.420 --> 01:55:29.863]  You know, during the trial, which took place back in July, and there's a gap in his teeth, which the Saddam that was captured didn't have.
[01:55:30.883 --> 01:55:34.165]  We had on the day the war started in Iraq, photos of Saddam.
[01:55:34.625 --> 01:55:38.926]  Most of you listeners will remember wearing the thick spectacles, didn't look like Saddam.
[01:55:39.327 --> 01:55:44.568]  We had this skinny Saddam doing a walkabout around Baghdad in the middle of the war in April.
[01:55:44.588 --> 01:55:45.989]  That wasn't Saddam.
[01:55:46.429 --> 01:55:48.671]  So I mean, who knows how many Sadams there are?
[01:55:48.711 --> 01:55:54.616]  I mean, we've had the reports that Sadam, whichever Sadam it is, has cancer and will die within two years.
[01:55:54.676 --> 01:56:01.682]  So whether they want to kill him off that way and not have him blow the whistle on the fact that he was armed, you know, by people like Donald Rumsfeld back in the early 80s,
[01:56:02.783 --> 01:56:06.286]  Um, or whether they will keep him alive with one of his doubles, who knows?
[01:56:06.347 --> 01:56:08.408]  I mean, the choice is up to them, but definitely Saddam.
[01:56:08.448 --> 01:56:10.530]  The Saddam thing is like Santa Claus.
[01:56:10.610 --> 01:56:12.572]  Every store, there's a different Santa Claus.
[01:56:12.672 --> 01:56:15.695]  Every, every door behind it, there's a different Saddam.
[01:56:15.755 --> 01:56:17.537]  It's like going to different department stores.
[01:56:17.877 --> 01:56:19.718]  Well, this Santa doesn't look like the last one.
[01:56:19.738 --> 01:56:21.420]  Well, it is, but it's still Santa.
[01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:22.721]  And it's still Saddam.
[01:56:22.781 --> 01:56:23.542]  It's still Saddam.
[01:56:23.582 --> 01:56:24.323]  Here's another one.
[01:56:24.643 --> 01:56:25.364]  They're everywhere.
[01:56:25.384 --> 01:56:26.404]  They're everywhere.
[01:56:27.005 --> 01:56:28.086]  Al, any other comments?
[01:56:28.740 --> 01:56:34.563]  Yeah, I was doing some internet searching on there, just typing and searching, and Hitler's doubles, Fadon's doubles.
[01:56:34.943 --> 01:56:42.527]  One of the websites was kind of funny, it had Fadon's doubles on Hollywood Square.
[01:56:42.727 --> 01:56:43.427]  I love it!
[01:56:43.968 --> 01:56:45.809]  Al, I want to thank you for the call.
[01:56:45.829 --> 01:56:47.469]  Alright, you're welcome.
[01:56:47.489 --> 01:56:48.110]  I appreciate it.
[01:56:48.150 --> 01:56:50.591]  Let's go immediately to Barbara in West
[01:56:51.238 --> 01:56:51.918]  Virginia.
[01:56:52.198 --> 01:56:53.339]  West Virginia.
[01:56:53.359 --> 01:56:56.099]  One of my favorite places in the entire country.
[01:56:56.519 --> 01:56:58.920]  Hi Barbara, Mountain Mama, West Virginia.
[01:56:58.940 --> 01:56:59.980]  That's what they call the state.
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:01.401]  Yeah, you got me.
[01:57:01.981 --> 01:57:03.541]  Hey, I'm a first-time caller.
[01:57:04.581 --> 01:57:05.041]  Welcome!
[01:57:05.782 --> 01:57:07.002]  And I'll be gentle.
[01:57:07.622 --> 01:57:09.022]  I'm excited, you know.
[01:57:09.122 --> 01:57:16.384]  I'm just, I'm one of these open-minded people who wants to be informed, you know.
[01:57:16.944 --> 01:57:19.325]  But I got a couple comments I wanted to make.
[01:57:20.337 --> 01:57:23.180]  Barbara, why don't you hold on and you're on the air.
[01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:27.003]  We're going to put you on right after we do our little quick opening.
[01:57:27.023 --> 01:57:28.184]  So you just hang on.
[01:57:28.224 --> 01:57:29.905]  We're not trying to cut you off or anything.
[01:57:29.945 --> 01:57:31.226]  We'll be real gentle with you.
[01:57:31.266 --> 01:57:38.612]  So we'll be back with Barbara from West Virginia and Paul Joseph Watson right after a very, very short couple of minutes.
[01:57:38.632 --> 01:57:39.153]  So hang on.
[01:57:50.256 --> 01:57:50.896]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.576 --> 01:57:52.617]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.337 --> 01:57:54.477]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.097 --> 01:57:55.918]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.678 --> 01:57:57.658]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.239 --> 01:58:01.900]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.420 --> 01:58:06.502]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:27.832 --> 01:58:38.779]  This is Erskine sitting in for Alex Jones and the number here 800-259-9231 but we've got, we're only going to take the people who are online waiting right now.
[01:58:38.839 --> 01:58:45.523]  We aren't going to be putting anybody new on for a little while because we've got Harry Brown joining Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:58:46.064 --> 01:58:46.244]  My
[01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:50.963]  The address is www.urskinonradio.com.
[01:58:51.403 --> 01:58:59.370]  We do a program on Saturday nights at 9 o'clock Pacific and it's midnight on the East Coast and it's a wonderful show coming up this week.
[01:58:59.390 --> 01:59:03.873]  We've got Donald Scott talking about the origin of AIDS.
[01:59:03.893 --> 01:59:07.596]  We've got Mike Brown from Mike Brown Solutions who's going to be on.
[01:59:07.636 --> 01:59:13.320]  We've got Harry Brown who's going to be on the third hour on urskinonradio.com.
[01:59:13.720 --> 01:59:15.322]  So be sure to go up and listen or listen
[01:59:16.022 --> 01:59:17.663]  Hopefully for your local radio station.
[01:59:17.703 --> 01:59:19.845]  If they're not carrying it, ask them why!
[01:59:20.065 --> 01:59:20.825]  They should be!
[01:59:21.186 --> 01:59:21.806]  They should be!
[01:59:21.826 --> 01:59:25.148]  Okay, and we're talking with Barbara from West Virginia.
[01:59:25.468 --> 01:59:28.170]  Barbara, you've got a couple of comments or questions for us?
[01:59:28.190 --> 01:59:29.431]  Oh yeah, I've got a bunch.
[01:59:29.531 --> 01:59:30.972]  I actually have a lot.
[01:59:30.992 --> 01:59:34.254]  We can only take a couple, so go with your top couple of questions.
[01:59:34.414 --> 01:59:40.058]  Okay, was he aware of Prescott Bush and how he got all his money?
[01:59:40.078 --> 01:59:44.521]  I'm understanding... Was he aware of that?
[01:59:45.172 --> 01:59:52.034]  I'm understanding that Prescott Bush was in cahoots with Hitler, with the main bank.
[01:59:52.054 --> 01:59:57.436]  Paul Joseph Watson, it's all in your book, Order Out of Chaos.
[01:59:57.456 --> 01:59:59.736]  Just a real brief answer on that.
[01:59:59.936 --> 02:00:03.957]  Is that ever covered by Mr. Watson and his book?
[02:00:04.017 --> 02:00:05.838]  Tell her a little couple things about it.
[02:00:06.621 --> 02:00:09.563]  Well yeah, he ran the majority of Nazi steel production.
[02:00:09.703 --> 02:00:11.344]  And I mean, the documents have come out on that.
[02:00:11.364 --> 02:00:14.166]  Associated Press have done big articles on it.
[02:00:14.186 --> 02:00:21.171]  Um, there was a guy in the New Hampshire Gazette who did a big piece on it, and then afterwards he was harassed by the Secret Service.
[02:00:21.692 --> 02:00:23.993]  So I mean, they don't want this kind of thing to get out.
[02:00:24.054 --> 02:00:33.881]  I mean, just go to PrisonPlanet.com, go to the search engine, type in, um, Bush Nazi Links, and you'll get a bunch of articles which pop up explaining all that.
[02:00:34.381 --> 02:00:35.722]  Okay, now what does, um,
[02:00:36.260 --> 02:00:38.841]  What does GW have to do with Eli Lilly?
[02:00:38.861 --> 02:00:42.482]  I don't know, I haven't looked into that.
[02:00:43.102 --> 02:00:46.643]  Is he part owner of it, or does he own Eli Lilly?
[02:00:47.384 --> 02:00:52.745]  I've heard that he owns a sizable amount of stock in that, so they're very happy when the Prozac sales are going up.
[02:00:53.505 --> 02:00:54.226]  Next question.
[02:00:54.586 --> 02:00:58.207]  Is that why they're trying to make cigarettes a medicine?
[02:00:59.933 --> 02:01:00.833]  I don't know.
[02:01:00.913 --> 02:01:02.734]  I don't know anything about that one, Barbara.
[02:01:02.754 --> 02:01:04.654]  We've got time for one more question.
[02:01:04.974 --> 02:01:05.494]  All right.
[02:01:07.394 --> 02:01:14.696]  They make a big deal, you know, they just had, Kerry was just here in July, and we got to go to his rally.
[02:01:15.156 --> 02:01:23.117]  While we were in line waiting to go into the rally, we had cars going by yelling, yelling pro-life, you know.
[02:01:23.817 --> 02:01:29.078]  And I was astounded when I hollered back at him, death penalty.
[02:01:30.535 --> 02:01:36.439]  So how can you say you're pro-life and death penalty out of the same person?
[02:01:40.021 --> 02:01:41.322]  To me that's a forked tongue.
[02:01:41.382 --> 02:01:46.164]  He's a big death penalty person.
[02:01:47.265 --> 02:01:50.187]  Yeah, I think a lot of people feel that way too.
[02:01:50.407 --> 02:01:55.450]  A lot of things don't make sense anymore on that.
[02:01:55.470 --> 02:01:57.191]  Paul, any comments on that?
[02:01:58.211 --> 02:02:00.873]  Well, yeah, you get hypocrisy on both sides of the equation.
[02:02:00.893 --> 02:02:17.166]  I mean, left-wingers will scream and bleat all day about babies dying in Iraq, which is right, but then they'll support abortion at home, in the light of the new evidence which proves that babies can walk in the womb, smile, laugh at 12 weeks old, and yet the law here in Britain is that
[02:02:17.526 --> 02:02:20.367]  Terminations can occur anything up to 24 weeks.
[02:02:20.507 --> 02:02:21.948]  I mean, I'm certainly pro-life.
[02:02:22.248 --> 02:02:30.791]  I'm against the death penalty for the very reasons that I've outlined before, which is you don't want to give a corrupt government that kind of power, because they will abuse it.
[02:02:30.951 --> 02:02:32.731]  So, that's my position.
[02:02:33.632 --> 02:02:34.672]  I have to agree with you.
[02:02:34.712 --> 02:02:40.014]  We'll be right back with Brian, Donna, Sharon, and Harry Brown on Erskine Overnight.
[02:02:41.374 --> 02:02:42.655]  Rather, on Alex Jones.
[02:02:42.975 --> 02:02:43.455]  I'm sorry!
[02:02:48.112 --> 02:02:53.614]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:54.014 --> 02:02:58.256]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:02:58.496 --> 02:03:05.519]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:05.899 --> 02:03:12.001]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:12.141 --> 02:03:13.362]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:13.702 --> 02:03:16.666]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:03:16.806 --> 02:03:18.848]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:03:19.149 --> 02:03:26.377]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:03:26.678 --> 02:03:30.082]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[02:03:58.460 --> 02:04:13.025]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:13.065 --> 02:04:13.385]  government.
[02:04:13.545 --> 02:04:15.366]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.

[02:05:25.793 --> 02:05:31.174]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:05:53.351 --> 02:05:54.454]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.095 --> 02:05:55.917]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.678 --> 02:05:57.480]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.226 --> 02:06:02.107]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.427 --> 02:06:06.528]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.429 --> 02:06:09.209]  Trust me, it has not been hijacked.
[02:06:09.289 --> 02:06:10.830]  It has not been taken off the air.
[02:06:10.890 --> 02:06:13.510]  This is the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[02:06:13.911 --> 02:06:14.751]  This is Erskine.
[02:06:14.871 --> 02:06:18.452]  I'm just sitting in, temporarily sitting in,
[02:06:19.304 --> 02:06:23.727]  For Alex Jones, not replacing him, just sitting in for Alex Jones.
[02:06:23.767 --> 02:06:26.069]  There is no replacement for Alex Jones.
[02:06:26.710 --> 02:06:34.635]  And I would also recommend to you, PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com, American Dictators, staged election 2004.

[02:06:44.181 --> 02:06:45.642]  One of the best ways.
[02:06:45.682 --> 02:06:47.422]  You want to fight what's going on?

[02:06:56.867 --> 02:06:57.927]  Some of these videos.
[02:06:57.987 --> 02:06:59.748]  Make copies of them if you want to.
[02:07:00.048 --> 02:07:01.208]  Get them out to your friends.
[02:07:01.289 --> 02:07:06.791]  Let America wake up before it is too late as to what's happening.
[02:07:07.535 --> 02:07:16.559]  Harry Brown is joining us this hour, and by us, I'm talking about Paul Joseph Watson, author of Order Out of Chaos and Erskine.
[02:07:16.739 --> 02:07:20.720]  And my website, if you want to contact me, is erskineonradio.com.
[02:07:21.181 --> 02:07:24.502]  W-W-W-E-R-S-K-I-N-E on radio.com.
[02:07:25.242 --> 02:07:30.584]  Now, Paul Joseph Watson wrote Order Out of Chaos, and Harry Brown was a 1996 and 2000 Libertarian candidate for president.
[02:07:34.696 --> 02:07:37.578]  For 30 years, he's been a successful investment advisor.
[02:07:37.638 --> 02:07:42.181]  His 1973 book was called, How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World.
[02:07:42.682 --> 02:07:44.383]  Became a New York Times bestseller.
[02:07:44.883 --> 02:07:49.066]  In 1995, he spoke to thousands of Americans who were frustrated with big government.
[02:07:50.091 --> 02:07:51.152]  Lord knows, aren't we all?
[02:07:51.712 --> 02:07:54.233]  When he wrote, Why Government Doesn't Work.
[02:07:54.293 --> 02:07:57.815]  He's the Director of Public Policy for DownsideDC.org.
[02:07:57.855 --> 02:08:01.257]  He has two weekly radio programs on the GCN Network.
[02:08:01.297 --> 02:08:06.439]  Plus, has just completed the pilot for a new fun TV show called Liberty Hour.
[02:08:06.920 --> 02:08:10.041]  Not like Harry's letting a lot of grass grow under his feet.
[02:08:10.321 --> 02:08:10.962]  Harry Brown.
[02:08:11.002 --> 02:08:11.602]  Hi, Harry.
[02:08:11.822 --> 02:08:12.482]  Hello there.
[02:08:12.702 --> 02:08:13.563]  Glad to be with you.
[02:08:14.455 --> 02:08:25.982]  When we're looking at what's going on and you're seeing coverage for an entire week of the Democratic Convention, coverage for the entire week of the Republican Convention, you're watching the debates coming up.
[02:08:27.003 --> 02:08:28.924]  We only have two parties in America?
[02:08:29.064 --> 02:08:30.605]  Is that what we're led to believe?
[02:08:30.725 --> 02:08:33.666]  Are they afraid to hear from any other parties?
[02:08:33.686 --> 02:08:41.251]  Harry, you're a person who was on the firing line with a third party that's on the ballot in virtually every state.
[02:08:42.242 --> 02:08:45.864]  And are they just afraid to hear any dissenting voices?
[02:08:45.944 --> 02:08:47.025]  What's going on, Harry?
[02:08:47.445 --> 02:08:57.091]  Well, most people don't realize that we have a two-party system in America, not because people have demanded it, but because the Republicans and Democrats have legislated it.
[02:08:57.792 --> 02:09:08.298]  They have ballot access laws in virtually every state that make it relatively easy for a Democrat or Republican to get on the ballot, but very difficult for a third-party candidate.
[02:09:08.598 --> 02:09:09.218]  For example,
[02:09:10.479 --> 02:09:16.162]  A Republican or Democrat might have to pay a $100 filing fee and supply a hundred signatures.
[02:09:16.522 --> 02:09:24.187]  A third party candidate might have to pay a $10,000 filing fee and provide a thousand or ten thousand signatures.
[02:09:24.567 --> 02:09:26.048]  It varies from state to state.
[02:09:26.068 --> 02:09:30.450]  And of course the campaign finance laws are designed to keep the incumbents in.
[02:09:30.970 --> 02:09:33.272]  So there is a huge legislative hurdle.
[02:09:33.332 --> 02:09:34.052]  When I ran in
[02:09:34.694 --> 02:10:02.121]  In 2000, I raised two and a half million dollars, but a large part of that had to go just for ballot access to get on the ballot in 50 states, so that money was not available to advertise and tell people that there was a better life available without an income tax, without being roped into Social Security, without a drug war, without a foreign policy that makes enemies all around the world, that we could have a peaceful America, we could have an America
[02:10:02.563 --> 02:10:07.124]  Like the Founding Fathers wanted, an America of Liberty, and pardon me for going on so long.
[02:10:07.924 --> 02:10:16.625]  No, no, for God's sake, you want to make your voice heard in America, you want to talk about what's going on in America, and you aren't allowed to in America.
[02:10:16.645 --> 02:10:25.247]  It's certainly become a joke, because when you're reading the Constitution, there's nothing in the Constitution about two parties.
[02:10:25.287 --> 02:10:30.828]  Let's go to Brian in Virginia, because he's been holding on a while, and he may have a question for you, Harry.
[02:10:30.868 --> 02:10:31.188]  Brian?
[02:10:31.903 --> 02:10:32.704]  Hey, thank you.
[02:10:33.384 --> 02:10:35.686]  First of all, I was going to say, you have a strong atheist following.
[02:10:35.706 --> 02:10:37.448]  I don't know if you know that or not.
[02:10:38.829 --> 02:10:40.550]  Well, that's fine.
[02:10:40.610 --> 02:10:41.451]  That's fine.
[02:10:41.691 --> 02:10:43.833]  That's absolutely fine.
[02:10:43.853 --> 02:10:45.915]  We have freedom of religion or no religion.
[02:10:49.137 --> 02:10:49.658]  Go ahead, Brian.
[02:10:49.678 --> 02:10:50.959]  I'm concerned about what's going on.
[02:10:51.739 --> 02:10:54.001]  I was going to mention, I sent some emails to you.
[02:10:55.142 --> 02:10:56.803]  One about the Rand Corporation.
[02:10:57.984 --> 02:10:58.625]  R-A-N-D.
[02:10:58.645 --> 02:10:59.866]  Familiar with them?
[02:11:00.430 --> 02:11:01.191]  The Think Tank?
[02:11:01.391 --> 02:11:02.011]  Absolutely.
[02:11:02.331 --> 02:11:02.872]  Absolutely.
[02:11:02.912 --> 02:11:05.994]  They're held by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society.
[02:11:08.016 --> 02:11:08.796]  They are owned by them.
[02:11:08.816 --> 02:11:09.036]  Okay.
[02:11:09.056 --> 02:11:09.997]  I sent you a filing.
[02:11:11.138 --> 02:11:12.219]  Well, you sent that to Alex.
[02:11:12.399 --> 02:11:13.379]  I sent it to Alex, yes.
[02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:15.541]  Right, okay.
[02:11:16.201 --> 02:11:17.703]  Okay, I'm sure he will.
[02:11:18.603 --> 02:11:25.688]  Well, the reason I guess I'm bringing that up also, I sent in photos of the Pyramid of Charles Tess Russell.
[02:11:27.049 --> 02:11:29.291]  That was in the graveyard in Pittsburgh.
[02:11:29.895 --> 02:11:31.636]  What does that have to do with anything?
[02:11:31.656 --> 02:11:33.316]  We have a multitude of religions.
[02:11:58.322 --> 02:12:06.926]  You look at the families involved, and usually the families you consider the Illuminati, and I don't know what their place is in the whole thing.
[02:12:06.966 --> 02:12:14.590]  I know I was raised one, and I know that I had the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.
[02:12:15.150 --> 02:12:18.632]  I know the theocratic language, and it seems kind of ominous.
[02:12:20.513 --> 02:12:26.656]  You know, I know they're sincere about their beliefs, but I think, of course, we all know they've been hoodwinked.
[02:12:29.335 --> 02:12:31.817]  Those are just some things I wouldn't mind someone looking into.
[02:12:32.277 --> 02:12:43.023]  Well, one of the things that we've talked about on my program has been some of the new translations of the Bible which are coming out of Oxford University Press in London, which is controlled by the Rothschilds.
[02:12:43.043 --> 02:12:43.824]  So there you go.
[02:12:44.264 --> 02:12:45.284]  Brian, thanks for the call.
[02:12:45.305 --> 02:12:46.765]  Let's go to Donna in Massachusetts.
[02:12:46.805 --> 02:12:52.209]  Donna, you've got a question for Paul Joseph Watson for Mr. Harry Brown.
[02:12:52.929 --> 02:12:55.290]  Hello, Mr. Ruskin, and hello, Harry Brown.
[02:12:56.932 --> 02:13:00.453]  Mr. Brown, I voted for you here, I believe it was eight years ago, you were on our ballot.
[02:13:01.033 --> 02:13:05.013]  As far as I was concerned, that was the only choice.
[02:13:05.053 --> 02:13:07.434]  Well, thank you very much.
[02:13:07.854 --> 02:13:12.055]  Now I know, now I think I've met almost everyone who voted for me.
[02:13:14.815 --> 02:13:24.377]  Oh, it is a sad state of affairs I'm calling because I had to go to court this morning to appeal a denial of my request
[02:13:26.013 --> 02:13:30.555]  And I have been in the military for 26 years now.
[02:13:31.435 --> 02:13:33.136]  I was activated for Desert Storm.
[02:13:33.996 --> 02:13:37.138]  And I have to know how to utilize weapons.
[02:13:37.198 --> 02:13:42.881]  But I was denied because the police chief said that I was deemed unsuitable.
[02:13:44.301 --> 02:13:49.684]  And he noted that, well, my husband is a highly decorated vet.
[02:13:50.344 --> 02:13:54.166]  He participated in Special Ops Vietnam.
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:14:06.930]  And they said that in this proceeding, they kept noting my husband's extraordinary record.
[02:14:07.590 --> 02:14:13.955]  So if you're a veteran, and if you have, if you're highly decorated, you are a threat now.
[02:14:14.256 --> 02:14:17.318]  And you should not be able to have a firearm.
[02:14:17.859 --> 02:14:23.984]  You should not be able to participate in any portion of the Bill of Rights, apparently.
[02:14:24.528 --> 02:14:31.829]  Well, Harry, you know one of the things that worried me is that they had these people who were pilots, and most of them came out of the military.
[02:14:32.310 --> 02:14:33.410]  They know what they're doing.
[02:14:33.430 --> 02:14:40.631]  They're responsible for you flying in the airplane, and yet they're saying, pilots, I don't know if they should have firearms or not.
[02:14:40.951 --> 02:14:42.752]  Wasn't that extraordinary too, Harry?
[02:14:43.072 --> 02:14:49.933]  Well, you know the Bill of Rights says that you have the right to keep and bear arms as long as your local police chief says it's alright.
[02:14:51.974 --> 02:14:53.836]  As long as the government says it's alright.
[02:14:54.096 --> 02:14:59.861]  Well, tell me, in this proceeding, were they citing your husband's record negatively?
[02:14:59.881 --> 02:15:01.042]  Yes!
[02:15:02.003 --> 02:15:05.065]  Pointing out that he was a danger because of his service record?
[02:15:05.185 --> 02:15:05.786]  Exactly!
[02:15:06.106 --> 02:15:06.927]  Isn't that something?
[02:15:07.647 --> 02:15:09.969]  That's what's so amazing.
[02:15:10.369 --> 02:15:14.173]  He's had numerous citations.
[02:15:14.253 --> 02:15:18.376]  He's earned the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, wounded three times.
[02:15:18.815 --> 02:15:20.516]  One of his wounds is a bayonet in the stomach.
[02:15:21.277 --> 02:15:27.841]  And he was recommended for the Medal of Honor because of what he did.
[02:15:27.881 --> 02:15:31.463]  And he saved lives in some of the operations he did, you know.
[02:15:32.704 --> 02:15:42.730]  I'm not saying he never did anything bad while he was over there, but because the police department sees him as some kind of a threat, they're holding it against me now.
[02:15:43.590 --> 02:15:43.910]  Threat?
[02:15:43.970 --> 02:15:44.731]  He's a hero!
[02:15:45.555 --> 02:16:14.484]  Yes, and of course the politicians are trying as hard as they can these days to latch themselves onto the military and to people like your husband and making such a big thing about the glorious service that they provided to the country but of course at the local level any police chief has the power to do this and Paul Joseph Watson in the last segment made a very very important point when he was talking about the death penalty he said he didn't want
[02:16:14.964 --> 02:16:34.360]  The corrupt government to have that power because the power would eventually be abused and that's the most important point it isn't the abuse of power that's the problem it is the power to abuse and the power is in the hands of the local police chiefs to grant or deny those permits
[02:16:34.700 --> 02:16:43.304]  The power is in the hands of the President to use the military for his purposes, for his political power.
[02:16:43.844 --> 02:16:47.446]  And if that power is there, it's going to be abused eventually.
[02:16:47.526 --> 02:16:51.188]  So when you think you're handing power to a good person,
[02:16:51.628 --> 02:17:02.071]  To do a good deed in a good government, remember that that power is still going to be there when a bad person gets elected and is ready to do a bad deed for a bad government.
[02:17:02.432 --> 02:17:14.595]  So we never want to give to the local government, the state government, or the federal government the power to abuse because eventually it will be abused and your story is a perfect example of that.
[02:17:14.815 --> 02:17:16.336]  There's nothing that I can offer you.
[02:17:16.596 --> 02:17:20.698]  They're talking in libertarian terms, which I know is not a problem for you.
[02:17:21.178 --> 02:17:24.720]  They're not talking anymore about your security.
[02:17:25.140 --> 02:17:27.562]  It has become security of the state.
[02:17:27.622 --> 02:17:29.343]  Have you noticed how it's been changing?
[02:17:29.583 --> 02:17:30.143]  Of course.
[02:17:30.163 --> 02:17:31.544]  Of course.
[02:17:31.584 --> 02:17:36.386]  The consideration of a politician is his own power.
[02:17:37.667 --> 02:17:43.670]  We're going to have to take a break right now, and if you've got anything else you want to comment on, Don, we'll be right back with you.

[02:17:46.255 --> 02:17:49.518]  Ever walk into someone's house and you can tell instantly they own pets?
[02:17:49.858 --> 02:17:54.523]  They've made the mistake of using a pet odor and stain product that only covers the problem temporarily.
[02:17:54.723 --> 02:17:56.244]  We don't have that problem in our home.
[02:17:56.444 --> 02:17:58.847]  We've discovered it's just better to use PAWS.

[02:18:47.153 --> 02:18:51.656]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:18:51.996 --> 02:18:56.098]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:18:56.398 --> 02:18:56.939]  We listened.
[02:18:57.239 --> 02:19:02.222]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:19:02.502 --> 02:19:02.982]  We listened.
[02:19:03.363 --> 02:19:06.404]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:19:06.845 --> 02:19:07.365]  We listened.
[02:19:07.825 --> 02:19:11.889]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:19:12.269 --> 02:19:12.770]  We listened.
[02:19:13.110 --> 02:19:18.355]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:19:18.755 --> 02:19:20.137]  Again, we listened.
[02:19:20.477 --> 02:19:27.864]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:19:28.244 --> 02:19:31.707]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling

[02:19:45.845 --> 02:19:49.746]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:19:49.966 --> 02:20:02.248]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:20:02.668 --> 02:20:03.068]  The U.S.
[02:20:03.108 --> 02:20:08.689]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:20:09.089 --> 02:20:11.290]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:20:13.170 --> 02:20:14.231]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[02:20:14.251 --> 02:20:17.112]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[02:20:17.212 --> 02:20:23.255]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[02:20:23.675 --> 02:20:27.037]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[02:20:50.735 --> 02:20:51.455]  Do you flip it?
[02:20:51.856 --> 02:20:54.218]  When I first started flippin' it, I couldn't believe my eyes!
[02:20:54.778 --> 02:20:56.740]  Once you start flippin' it, you'll never stop!
[02:20:57.250 --> 02:21:01.151]  The next time you pick up one of your beauty products, flip it over and examine the ingredients.
[02:21:01.511 --> 02:21:04.091]  You'll be astonished by what the packaging reveals to you.
[02:21:04.552 --> 02:21:09.013]  Many mainstream beauty products are comprised almost entirely of synthetic petrochemicals.

[02:21:52.956 --> 02:21:55.840]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:58.343 --> 02:22:01.287]  It's the Alex Jones Show on GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:01.307 --> 02:22:05.173]  This is Erskine sitting in today and tomorrow for Alex Jones.
[02:22:05.865 --> 02:22:09.906]  Be sure and pick up a copy of Alex's videos.
[02:22:10.326 --> 02:22:31.031]  The PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com, The American Dictators, The Staged Election of 2004 is one of the videos available, and the person who did the video is with us right now, Alex Jones, direct from his interview that he got out on C-SPAN, as Sharon told us, at the very first hour.
[02:22:31.431 --> 02:22:33.152]  Alex, welcome to your own program.
[02:22:33.812 --> 02:22:34.293]  Yes, sir.
[02:22:34.313 --> 02:22:35.914]  Erskine, I'm sorry I called in late.
[02:22:36.014 --> 02:22:37.175]  I was here at Ground Zero.
[02:22:37.315 --> 02:22:47.423]  Despite the fact that the 9-11 Truth Group has a permit to be here, I was just threatened with arrest and had to get myself out of that and had to basically threaten to sue them to have them leave me alone.
[02:22:48.024 --> 02:22:52.147]  And as I'm speaking, you've got the cameras rolling just to document everything in case they try something.
[02:22:52.568 --> 02:22:57.532]  I've almost been arrested three times every day anywhere in the city videotaping anything.
[02:22:57.572 --> 02:22:58.773]  It is an absolute nightmare.
[02:22:59.493 --> 02:23:01.234]  Uh, just, just so much has happened.
[02:23:01.655 --> 02:23:07.458]  And what I'll do is, I guess the last 20 minutes of the program, I'm going to call in and get everybody an update on what's happened in the last day.
[02:23:07.838 --> 02:23:12.381]  There is just so much here that we're surrounded by police and they're coming in with plastic handcuffs.
[02:23:12.661 --> 02:23:17.584]  What they'll do is just encircle peaceful crowds with this orange netting and then round everybody up and arrest them.
[02:23:18.305 --> 02:23:24.414]  There's over 2,000 people that they put in a camp, Pier 57, an old condemned bus terminal where they parked the buses.
[02:23:24.494 --> 02:23:26.658]  It's a giant facility out over the Hudson River.
[02:23:26.678 --> 02:23:29.763]  It's being called Guantanamo on the Hudson.
[02:23:30.043 --> 02:23:32.968]  Erskine, we were threatened with arrest there as well.
[02:23:33.588 --> 02:23:37.250]  We've had them grab cameras and smash them right in front of us.
[02:23:37.270 --> 02:23:40.611]  They were so stupid they didn't know our other camera was rolling getting this.
[02:23:41.312 --> 02:23:43.072]  This city is in total marginal loss.
[02:23:43.092 --> 02:23:47.294]  Surveillance blimps, helicopters everywhere, military on the streets, militarized police.
[02:23:47.755 --> 02:23:49.175]  It is just thoroughly disgusting.
[02:23:49.935 --> 02:23:55.198]  2,000 people in a condemned building that the bus company pulled people out of.
[02:23:56.438 --> 02:24:03.420]  Six years ago, because the asbestos is hanging down, they have barbed wire inside, in containment facilities, with porta-potties outside.
[02:24:03.440 --> 02:24:05.621]  People have to beg to use the bathroom.
[02:24:05.641 --> 02:24:08.422]  2,000 people at any one time locked up in this giant pen.
[02:24:08.742 --> 02:24:09.762]  It has been totally bedlam.
[02:24:09.962 --> 02:24:11.043]  It is so exciting, though.
[02:24:11.323 --> 02:24:15.844]  I've run into probably 500, 600 people now that are fans of the radio show and aware of the new world.
[02:24:16.184 --> 02:24:17.205]  We're good to go.
[02:24:39.444 --> 02:24:43.927]  Hundreds of the people that have been arrested are literally foreign tourists, old ladies who are in wheelchairs.
[02:24:43.947 --> 02:24:50.032]  They will just block off a whole street in a quote, authorized protest, come in with this orange netting, round everybody up.
[02:24:50.352 --> 02:24:54.095]  Now they will ride horses into people, they will ride mopeds into people to cause crises.
[02:24:54.135 --> 02:24:56.737]  Many of the anarchists work for them, have been threatening us.
[02:24:56.757 --> 02:24:59.518]  There's just a few hundred anarchists that are used to create crises.
[02:24:59.719 --> 02:25:02.661]  The march on Sunday had over 300,000 people in it.
[02:25:02.901 --> 02:25:04.422]  There have been huge protests everywhere.
[02:25:04.462 --> 02:25:07.084]  The news is totally distorting all of this, Erskine.
[02:25:08.121 --> 02:25:19.084]  It's not on CNN, it's not on NBC, ABC, CBS, and the estimates of the crowd is anywhere from 250,000 to 500,000, but it is covered by the foreign press.
[02:25:19.404 --> 02:25:20.985]  We're not allowed to see it ourselves.
[02:25:21.425 --> 02:25:24.526]  Are we in New York City, Police State 2004?
[02:25:25.326 --> 02:25:26.646]  Is this a police state?
[02:25:26.786 --> 02:25:31.207]  Is this what you were talking about in Police State 1, 2, and 3?
[02:25:31.408 --> 02:25:32.968]  Is it here now in New York?
[02:25:33.428 --> 02:25:33.748]  It is.
[02:25:33.848 --> 02:25:35.069]  Everything is color of law.
[02:25:35.109 --> 02:25:36.410]  There's no logins filming.
[02:25:36.690 --> 02:25:40.493]  But anywhere you are on the street doing anything, they will treat you like dogs.
[02:25:40.513 --> 02:25:41.954]  They're on a total power trip.
[02:25:42.234 --> 02:25:44.175]  They are hyped up and just raging.
[02:25:44.675 --> 02:25:47.457]  And anybody that shows any fear automatically gets arrested.
[02:25:47.477 --> 02:25:50.419]  I've noticed you have to buck up and bull up and say, I got the first amendment.
[02:25:50.439 --> 02:25:51.620]  You do whatever you want, buddy.
[02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:59.426]  And, uh, right now they were getting the cuffs out about to arrest me here at a, uh, march that actually has a permit in front of Ground Zero.
[02:25:59.586 --> 02:26:00.607]  We're here talking about 9-11.
[02:26:00.687 --> 02:26:02.909]  We're here talking about who was behind 9-11.
[02:26:02.949 --> 02:26:10.595]  And I have them, you know, threaten to arrest me again, saying, saying that my press pass was improper, as if I even need a press pass to be here.
[02:26:10.615 --> 02:26:12.696]  This is absolutely disgusting.
[02:26:12.996 --> 02:26:19.922]  And it sickens me to see America being turned into this, but it's only going to get worse and worse and worse because of what these scoundrels have done.
[02:26:20.382 --> 02:26:22.284]  The globalists have come back to the scene of the crime.
[02:26:22.304 --> 02:26:24.006]  They have come back to the scene of what they did on 9-11.
[02:26:24.086 --> 02:26:26.809]  And we are going to continue to stand up against them.
[02:26:26.849 --> 02:26:32.034]  And last time I got live on C-SPAN, kind of guerrilla information warfare tactic, and got the truth out.
[02:26:32.054 --> 02:26:33.816]  Erskine, you've obviously already heard about that.
[02:26:34.557 --> 02:26:35.438]  We've heard about it.
[02:26:35.478 --> 02:26:36.799]  We're trying to get a video of it.
[02:26:37.039 --> 02:26:43.386]  And you've got 50%, according to Zogby Poll, of the New Yorkers are aware that the
[02:26:44.501 --> 02:26:46.864]  Let me give folks the actual Zogby poll.
[02:26:46.884 --> 02:26:47.485]  49% in New York City
[02:27:02.851 --> 02:27:04.152]  I finally got a copy of it.
[02:27:04.272 --> 02:27:07.854]  49% in New York City believe it was government prior knowledge or involvement.
[02:27:08.615 --> 02:27:11.836]  In New York State itself, 41% believe that.
[02:27:12.217 --> 02:27:21.262]  And 68% want Eliot Spitzer to do an independent investigation and do not believe in the 9-11 whitewash commission appointed by George W. New World Order liberal Bush.
[02:27:21.622 --> 02:27:31.288]  We'll be right back with Alex Jones' live report from New York and Harry Brown and Paul Joseph Watson who are also going to be talking with Alex right after these words.
[02:27:36.152 --> 02:27:39.155]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.

[02:29:46.207 --> 02:29:47.187]  It's finally here!
[02:29:47.327 --> 02:29:48.307]  Spring has arrived!
[02:29:48.507 --> 02:29:51.468]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:29:51.688 --> 02:29:55.149]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:29:55.349 --> 02:30:03.510]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[02:31:10.012 --> 02:31:18.258]  This is the only place, this is the Alex Jones Program, where you're going to understand what's going on for real in New York and the poll results.
[02:31:18.338 --> 02:31:26.925]  May 26th, Toronto Star reported a national poll showed that 63, 63% of Canadians are convinced that U.S.
[02:31:26.985 --> 02:31:30.248]  leaders had prior knowledge of the attacks and yet declined to act.
[02:31:30.648 --> 02:31:31.889]  66% of New Yorkers
[02:31:33.690 --> 02:31:42.858]  According to the Zogby Poll just released August 30th, call for a new probe of unanswered questions by Congress or New York's Attorney General.
[02:31:43.298 --> 02:31:56.009]  You've got 49.3% of New York residents and 41% of the New York citizens overall say that some of our leaders knew in advance that attacks were planned on or around September 11, 2001.
[02:31:56.089 --> 02:31:57.610]  And they consciously failed to act.
[02:32:01.133 --> 02:32:05.275]  That is half, half of the New York City residents.
[02:32:05.655 --> 02:32:09.877]  This is ground zero, where it happened, New York City.
[02:32:10.057 --> 02:32:12.518]  They're not buying the government version.
[02:32:12.758 --> 02:32:17.920]  They know that it is order out of chaos, elite sponsored terrorism and New World Order.
[02:32:18.500 --> 02:32:22.284]  The report on what's going on right from ground zero.
[02:32:22.464 --> 02:32:28.990]  I want you to hear it again from Alex Jones, the man who's there who was almost arrested three times.
[02:32:29.490 --> 02:32:31.292]  Alex, give that report again.
[02:32:31.372 --> 02:32:32.353]  How bad is it?
[02:32:33.588 --> 02:32:35.390]  It's unspeakable, it's indescribable.
[02:32:35.510 --> 02:32:44.477]  Again, I'm here at Ground Zero, surrounded by survivors of 9-11, people who were here, people... I've talked to a bunch of people who were there, firefighters saying, get back.
[02:32:44.737 --> 02:32:45.898]  We're about to bring down Building 7.
[02:32:46.039 --> 02:32:48.200]  People even heard it on NPR that day.
[02:32:48.260 --> 02:32:50.362]  It's admitted that they blew up Building 7.
[02:32:50.542 --> 02:32:53.865]  The owner's even gone on television and said, we've made the decision to pull it.
[02:32:54.145 --> 02:32:55.807]  I'm right here by Silverstein Properties.
[02:32:55.867 --> 02:33:01.071]  I'm right here, just 50 feet from the pit, surrounded by police with their clubs out just staring at us.
[02:33:01.671 --> 02:33:01.911]  I think so.
[02:33:19.497 --> 02:33:21.638]  It is very, very painful.
[02:33:21.878 --> 02:33:26.379]  Now, folks, here is a survivor, a lady who worked in the center.
[02:33:26.599 --> 02:33:34.701]  And ma'am, can you tell us your name and why you're out here handing out information, deception dollars and the 9-11 truth movement pamphlets to people?
[02:33:35.062 --> 02:33:42.844]  Can you tell the listeners, just in a nutshell, what most of your workers are thinking and some of the key things that you think are cover-ups involving 9-11?
[02:33:43.832 --> 02:33:47.035]  Well, at a minimum, that 7 World Trade, absolutely.
[02:33:47.095 --> 02:33:47.575]  What's your name?
[02:33:47.956 --> 02:33:49.357]  My name is Andrea Pesaurus.
[02:33:49.557 --> 02:33:54.941]  I have worked and lived in New York for more than 20 years and happen to have been working in the downtown area, actually.
[02:33:54.961 --> 02:33:59.545]  I was working in the World Financial Center complex on the day of September 11th.
[02:34:00.266 --> 02:34:01.607]  I was in the building during the night before.
[02:34:01.627 --> 02:34:05.110]  I'm a member of a professional association on the 44th floor of 1 World Trade.
[02:34:05.566 --> 02:34:08.229]  I supervise an office in One World Trade back in the mid-eighties.
[02:34:08.509 --> 02:34:10.271]  What are some of the key points you told me about earlier?
[02:34:10.371 --> 02:34:16.057]  Some of the key points are that there were explosives up through Six World Trade that I heard before Ida Tower came down.
[02:34:16.737 --> 02:34:25.126]  Seven World Trade we knew was not in bad condition and later on in the day on live radio where one of our local live reporters was downtown
[02:34:25.666 --> 02:34:26.367]  We're good to go.
[02:34:45.701 --> 02:34:46.721]  Ma'am, I was talking to you.
[02:34:46.761 --> 02:34:47.482]  You live down here.
[02:34:47.502 --> 02:34:48.762]  You said you talked to the widows.
[02:34:48.782 --> 02:34:49.662]  You talked to the locals.
[02:34:49.862 --> 02:34:53.363]  Can you tell us about people who were discussing the explosives and the rest of it?
[02:34:53.643 --> 02:34:56.044]  And you said you talked to locals who were told to get back.
[02:34:56.064 --> 02:34:57.024]  They were about to bring down Building 7.
[02:34:57.404 --> 02:34:58.604]  Can you repeat that for the listeners?
[02:34:59.185 --> 02:35:00.465]  There was... Tell us who you are.
[02:35:00.885 --> 02:35:12.368]  I'm Arlene Rubin, and they said over and over again that from the base of the building and from the mid-floors that explosives were bringing down the World Trade Center to run for your life.
[02:35:13.738 --> 02:35:14.458]  Unbelievable.
[02:35:14.498 --> 02:35:17.619]  They said explosives were bringing it down run for your life.
[02:35:17.659 --> 02:35:21.840]  Building 7 was blown when they said the words Larry Silverstein.
[02:35:22.140 --> 02:35:23.881]  They told him they're going to pull it.
[02:35:24.161 --> 02:35:28.882]  That means that the building had already been armed, wired with explosives.
[02:35:29.042 --> 02:35:31.523]  Prior wiring with explosives, Alex.
[02:35:32.711 --> 02:35:33.712]  It's incredible, Erskine.
[02:35:33.752 --> 02:35:35.773]  I know you've got Harry Brown and Paul Watson.
[02:35:35.813 --> 02:35:37.214]  Why don't you bring those guys up?
[02:35:37.234 --> 02:35:38.695]  I don't want to monopolize it.
[02:35:38.715 --> 02:35:38.956]  Absolutely.
[02:35:39.016 --> 02:35:42.538]  Paul, Harry, anything you want to ask Alex right now at Ground Zero?
[02:35:42.798 --> 02:35:43.198]  Well, yeah.
[02:35:43.339 --> 02:35:45.400]  I mean, if I can jump in, I'd just ask Alex.
[02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:52.525]  I mean, we've had reports about police arresting medics so that, you know, the handcuffed and beaten protesters couldn't get treatment.
[02:35:52.605 --> 02:36:01.972]  All kinds of... We've got video, Paul, we've got video of them with giant orange construction fences rounding up peaceful
[02:36:02.702 --> 02:36:05.364]  Well, yeah, and those articles have been in the New York Daily News.
[02:36:05.384 --> 02:36:06.544]  Also, we've had reports about
[02:36:30.060 --> 02:36:31.902]  Yes, we've been threatened by the communists.
[02:36:31.922 --> 02:36:33.523]  They said, we wish Stalin would kill you.
[02:36:33.543 --> 02:36:36.085]  Most of the so-called anarchists are really communists.
[02:36:47.635 --> 02:36:49.036]  They seem to be working with the police.
[02:36:49.276 --> 02:36:50.277]  They're never arrested.
[02:36:50.437 --> 02:36:52.958]  They'll go burn something or punch somebody or throw something at a cop.
[02:36:53.258 --> 02:36:58.721]  Then they pull back and a police captain will give an order and they'll rush them with horses or mopeds and run over crowds.
[02:36:58.881 --> 02:37:00.462]  When people fight back, there's a riot.
[02:37:00.622 --> 02:37:01.843]  And they begin pell-mell.
[02:37:02.063 --> 02:37:07.986]  Yeah, there'll be 600, 800 armed, ninja-outfitted, armored-outfitted cops.
[02:37:08.206 --> 02:37:10.447]  We'll run out of a parking garage who are just waiting.
[02:37:10.727 --> 02:37:11.728]  These are staged events.
[02:37:11.748 --> 02:37:13.869]  They will usher a crowd of a few thousand people.
[02:37:13.889 --> 02:37:16.811]  There's dozens of small protests going on spontaneously everywhere.
[02:37:16.971 --> 02:37:20.973]  They will usher them down a few streets, tell them, go this way, go that way, come with us.
[02:37:21.253 --> 02:37:22.914]  Then they get people herded into a spot.
[02:37:23.094 --> 02:37:29.498]  Then the anarchists do something and then waiting cops come running out of parking garages or waiting buses to beat the living daylights out of them.
[02:37:31.807 --> 02:37:34.408]  This is nowhere on U.S.
[02:37:34.589 --> 02:37:34.909]  media.
[02:37:34.949 --> 02:37:36.450]  You're not seeing it anywhere.
[02:37:36.790 --> 02:37:37.930]  Comment on that, Alex.
[02:37:38.631 --> 02:37:40.612]  Well, I mean, basically, I'd like to hear from Harry Brown.
[02:37:40.692 --> 02:37:42.253]  But, I mean, there is a total media blackout.
[02:37:42.453 --> 02:37:43.453]  They're distorting the news.
[02:37:43.473 --> 02:37:45.254]  There is no liberal or conservative media.
[02:37:45.274 --> 02:37:46.755]  It's globalist corporate media.
[02:37:46.815 --> 02:37:47.695]  It's not free market.
[02:37:47.795 --> 02:37:48.776]  They're organized criminals.
[02:37:49.116 --> 02:37:50.457]  Does Mr. Brown have any comments?
[02:37:51.252 --> 02:37:54.473]  Well, obviously it's a terrible situation.
[02:37:54.734 --> 02:38:03.458]  I want to take a look on the web and see if CNN or NBC or any of these networks are putting it at least up on the internet.
[02:38:04.178 --> 02:38:10.521]  And, of course, I don't sit and watch network news all day long, so I have no idea what's going on on TV.
[02:38:11.481 --> 02:38:15.785]  Uh, does anybody else here, uh, has anybody else watched TV this morning?
[02:38:15.805 --> 02:38:17.866]  Well, well at night when I get in at 2 a.m.
[02:38:17.946 --> 02:38:24.952]  after, you know, these 14, 15 hour days, I'll watch Fox, I'll watch CNN, and the first few days it's like, everything's great!
[02:38:24.972 --> 02:38:27.814]  We'll see in a report on the protest, but Fox is like, everything's great!
[02:38:27.854 --> 02:38:29.676]  Everybody, people, New Yorkers love us!
[02:38:30.016 --> 02:38:31.397]  Man, things are really going well!
[02:38:31.617 --> 02:38:34.840]  Meanwhile, I'm outside with hundreds of thousands of people going, no, I haven't been well, no, no!
[02:38:36.662 --> 02:38:41.590]  I mean, it's just a complete opposite of what the news is portraying.
[02:38:41.870 --> 02:38:47.058]  Now the New York media is reporting on a lot of this, but not on the provocateur nature of these anarchists.
[02:38:48.753 --> 02:38:51.516]  It is being reported in foreign news, Alex.
[02:38:51.696 --> 02:38:56.481]  It's being reported on German, it's being reported on BBC, it's being reported on Canadian.
[02:38:56.821 --> 02:39:00.564]  The foreign news services are covering the demonstrations.
[02:39:00.925 --> 02:39:04.889]  Well, I'll tell you what, I want you to talk to Kevin Booth, who's a cameraman and also working with me on this film.
[02:39:05.389 --> 02:39:06.710]  Kevin's over here running the camera.
[02:39:07.011 --> 02:39:09.413]  I'll tell you what, Ted, will you take over for Kevin?
[02:39:10.114 --> 02:39:13.697]  And then I want you to describe how they took our camera away and smashed it.
[02:39:13.957 --> 02:39:15.297]  Hey, how's it going?
[02:39:15.337 --> 02:39:15.798]  Hi, Kevin.
[02:39:15.818 --> 02:39:16.998]  What's going on over there?
[02:39:17.038 --> 02:39:17.518]  It's pretty crazy.
[02:39:17.558 --> 02:39:19.999]  Everywhere we're going, there's a group gathering around Alex.
[02:39:20.019 --> 02:39:22.820]  It's pretty crazy because the police really don't know what to make of him.
[02:39:44.860 --> 02:39:49.201]  You know, they keep coming up to him and of course he doesn't back down at all.
[02:39:49.241 --> 02:39:56.424]  They kind of just are staying out of arm's reach of Alex the whole time.
[02:39:56.464 --> 02:39:58.665]  They're definitely keeping an eye on us the whole time.
[02:39:59.338 --> 02:40:06.179]  Last time we were here at the 9-11 site, we were having some kind of government agent guy taking still photographs of our faces.
[02:40:07.460 --> 02:40:08.240]  Right out of a movie.
[02:40:08.280 --> 02:40:15.441]  I mean, like a plainclothes guy with a tan vest on with a classic big zoom lens camera.
[02:40:16.261 --> 02:40:19.682]  And, you know, just standing there taking close-up stills of all of our faces.
[02:40:19.942 --> 02:40:23.343]  And so I know I'm on the list with Alex now.
[02:40:23.623 --> 02:40:24.683]  Officially on the list.
[02:40:25.885 --> 02:40:27.066]  We've had some crazy moments.
[02:40:27.106 --> 02:40:29.227]  Tell them about the port.
[02:40:29.388 --> 02:40:30.468]  Well, what about the port?
[02:40:30.508 --> 02:40:33.250]  Well, tell them about the jet boats chasing us.
[02:40:33.290 --> 02:40:34.031]  Yeah, we went out.
[02:40:34.151 --> 02:40:36.433]  A friend of ours has a really fast boat.
[02:40:36.453 --> 02:40:37.814]  He's a fan of Alex's.
[02:40:37.874 --> 02:40:39.815]  He has like a cigarette ocean racer.
[02:40:40.416 --> 02:40:42.937]  And he took us out at night to show us the Statue of Liberty.
[02:40:43.138 --> 02:40:46.220]  And we had the Homeland Security boats come up to us.
[02:40:46.240 --> 02:40:48.962]  They're just like out of the scene apocalypse now.
[02:40:49.602 --> 02:40:53.105]  Where the boats come up and they do the search on you.
[02:40:53.757 --> 02:41:02.783]  And this is funny, because the guy, you know, they kind of play a game of intimidation with him, but after we were okay with him, he just took off in one direction, and the boats like gave chase to us.
[02:41:03.584 --> 02:41:07.686]  And this guy just kind of plays the game, and he just hit the throttle full blast.
[02:41:07.727 --> 02:41:11.269]  We watched this little flashing cherry light disappear over the horizon.
[02:41:11.289 --> 02:41:13.230]  It's all about the guns, though.
[02:41:13.250 --> 02:41:17.953]  Yeah, they had .50 caliber machine guns mounted on the front of these Homeland Security boats, Coast Guard boats.
[02:41:18.674 --> 02:41:23.037]  And then we had to take a subway back, because we didn't get a taxi cab, and we had a situation where
[02:41:23.703 --> 02:41:27.324]  We saw this really sad scene with this old lady.
[02:41:27.484 --> 02:41:28.764]  We all felt really sorry for her.
[02:41:28.784 --> 02:41:35.005]  She was terribly hunchbacked and sleeping in a subway station.
[02:41:35.025 --> 02:41:36.005]  We all felt really horrible.
[02:41:36.065 --> 02:41:47.748]  She was asleep, so John Stanton, our gate, got out of the subway for a second, I think for like a $5 or $10 bill, inside of her purse, and we videotaped us doing it, and the police jumped out and grabbed Alex's camera.
[02:41:50.407 --> 02:41:51.588]  They shut down the subway.
[02:41:51.648 --> 02:41:52.429]  They got us off.
[02:41:52.449 --> 02:41:56.091]  They were going to detain us at the station for a really long time.
[02:41:56.111 --> 02:41:58.633]  Then this other woman that was there with us took a picture of them.
[02:41:58.673 --> 02:42:02.015]  They ended up tearing all the film out of her camera.
[02:42:03.455 --> 02:42:09.099]  Even when we went to the convention last night, there's just one person after another grabbing your pass and checking on you.
[02:42:09.759 --> 02:42:10.840]  It's like you're damned if you do.
[02:42:10.860 --> 02:42:11.520]  You're damned if you don't.
[02:42:12.597 --> 02:42:19.842]  If you have a short hair and you look like a Republican and have a Republican pass, then you've got one group of people screaming at you.
[02:42:20.342 --> 02:42:24.565]  If you look kind of liberal or like you have long hair, then you've got the police surrounding you.
[02:42:24.585 --> 02:42:25.866]  No one the hell was in condition.
[02:42:26.466 --> 02:42:32.871]  And you know, in Austin where I live, if I see like just a couple of cops here or there, I keep an eye out for them or just whatever.
[02:42:32.931 --> 02:42:33.911]  I don't break the law.
[02:42:33.971 --> 02:42:36.113]  But I still, you know, you're aware of them.
[02:42:36.753 --> 02:42:40.656]  But here, after just four or five days, I've noticed myself just walking
[02:42:41.528 --> 02:42:45.431]  Kevin, has it become an us versus them mentality?
[02:43:11.499 --> 02:43:12.120]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:17.906]  Although, you know, the sad thing is a lot of the cops, probably as people, they're probably not bad people as people.
[02:43:17.946 --> 02:43:23.012]  Or even, you know, I spent a lot of time in Los Angeles, and I think the LAPD, they have like a meaner mentality.
[02:43:24.053 --> 02:43:32.382]  And when you get these guys off separately by themselves, they all seem to be like nice people, but it's definitely like a group thing, for sure, all together.
[02:43:33.147 --> 02:43:37.589]  And when you're out there on the street, they just kind of have this invincible attitude.
[02:43:37.709 --> 02:43:40.270]  You know, when they get mad at you, they ratchet up.
[02:43:40.290 --> 02:43:46.132]  If they have a reason to come after you, you can be the most reasonable, normal person, and they'll just start screaming in your face.
[02:43:46.852 --> 02:43:48.792]  And it's completely unnecessary.
[02:43:48.812 --> 02:43:54.074]  You know, there's just situations where it's just a couple of police and us, and you know, we're walking around with a camera.
[02:43:54.094 --> 02:43:55.395]  We have, you know, photocasts.
[02:43:55.415 --> 02:43:56.495]  We're nicely dressed.
[02:43:57.035 --> 02:44:01.657]  And these guys are in your face, screaming at you, and you're just... What are you expecting tonight?
[02:44:03.197 --> 02:44:04.858]  Well, I have no idea.
[02:44:04.898 --> 02:44:09.161]  You know, the anarchists have been threatening, like, some big surprise for the last three days.
[02:44:09.181 --> 02:44:13.924]  The police think that they're kind of, like, you know, they keep saying, oh, tonight at 7, and then it doesn't happen.
[02:44:14.125 --> 02:44:15.526]  Tomorrow at 3, and then it doesn't happen.
[02:44:15.546 --> 02:44:21.249]  So the police and everybody's kind of on edge, waiting for the anarchists to pull some big surprise.
[02:44:22.430 --> 02:44:23.871]  So we have no idea.
[02:44:23.911 --> 02:44:24.452]  We have no idea.
[02:44:24.472 --> 02:44:25.092]  It could go either way.
[02:44:25.112 --> 02:44:30.136]  I know they have a secret train underground ready to take George Bush off the island, you know, ASAP.
[02:44:31.375 --> 02:44:33.096]  Harry, Paul, any questions?
[02:44:34.057 --> 02:44:36.399]  Yeah, I'll just jump in there and ask Kevin.
[02:44:36.759 --> 02:44:46.666]  We've had reports which were carried in the daily news about plain-clothed police officers randomly plowing mopeds into giant groups of people.
[02:44:46.686 --> 02:44:49.048]  Have you seen any examples of that take place?
[02:44:49.588 --> 02:44:54.351]  I just, all I saw was on the news and just probably the same story you've seen, you know.
[02:44:55.052 --> 02:45:00.676]  And, you know, basically, anyways, here's Alex, it was great talking to you guys.
[02:45:01.974 --> 02:45:02.715]  Alright, thanks a lot guys.
[02:45:02.755 --> 02:45:04.176]  We've got to reload our camera.
[02:45:04.196 --> 02:45:05.317]  It's dangerous to not have it reloaded.
[02:45:05.337 --> 02:45:06.117]  We just ran out of tape.
[02:45:06.477 --> 02:45:07.598]  Erskine, I don't want to monopolize here.
[02:45:07.638 --> 02:45:12.081]  Do you want me to let you go and let Harry and Paul and you continue?
[02:45:12.861 --> 02:45:18.785]  There isn't any monopoly because this is a report that no one is getting anywhere else on American news.
[02:45:19.005 --> 02:45:21.067]  It is simply not getting out.
[02:45:21.247 --> 02:45:27.751]  You are breaking a story that other people aren't getting unless they watch C-SPAN.
[02:45:27.991 --> 02:45:30.773]  Let me pose this question to Harry Brown and Paul Watson.
[02:45:31.511 --> 02:45:43.216]  In America, is it proper that we are on major city streets, not even around secure facilities, and people run up and scream, even with press passes, which we shouldn't even have to have, threatening to arrest us for videotaping?
[02:45:43.256 --> 02:45:48.058]  It's all color of law, and that's just part of this process of people being afraid to even tape.
[02:45:48.078 --> 02:45:49.339]  Do you guys have any comments about that?
[02:45:51.820 --> 02:46:18.821]  Well, while you've been talking I've been surfing the net here and CNN has a story on the protesters down on the bottom of another story and they say that 1,700 have been arrested and they talk about the complaints about the conditions of those prisoners but I didn't find anything on the Fox News site and I find very little on the CBS site and that's as far as I've gotten so far.
[02:46:19.827 --> 02:46:23.549]  Well, it's normally 15 to 2,000 at any one time in the camp.
[02:46:23.929 --> 02:46:27.011]  They're normally there about 25 hours on average to spend on the local news.
[02:46:27.051 --> 02:46:27.791]  The police have met it.
[02:46:28.071 --> 02:46:30.272]  But then I look at the national news, I find almost nothing.
[02:46:30.533 --> 02:46:33.154]  And then I've talked to people from the union, it's been in the newspaper.
[02:46:33.354 --> 02:46:34.895]  The building is full of asbestos.
[02:46:35.135 --> 02:46:36.656]  The cops don't even want to work in there.
[02:46:36.936 --> 02:46:39.697]  Their union's complaining, and it's not even set up to be a jail.
[02:46:39.997 --> 02:46:48.642]  They have them just caged up behind barbed wire inside a 70-year-old bus terminal with literally an inch of grime and oil and chemicals on the ground, Harry.
[02:46:49.531 --> 02:46:50.112]  That's Pier 57.
[02:46:50.813 --> 02:46:52.595]  Now, question for you, Alex.
[02:46:52.895 --> 02:46:56.620]  How many people are there protesting, would you estimate?
[02:46:57.774 --> 02:47:01.096]  Well, again, the big combined march was on Sunday, over 300,000.
[02:47:01.256 --> 02:47:05.999]  I mean, these were marches five, ten blocks long, covering five streets.
[02:47:06.079 --> 02:47:07.781]  I mean, it was just ultra-massive.
[02:47:08.081 --> 02:47:12.484]  Everywhere I drove all over the city, 5,000 here, 10,000 there, 100,000 here, 20,000 there.
[02:47:12.744 --> 02:47:16.666]  And then now, throughout the week, basically, there's just protesters everywhere.
[02:47:17.006 --> 02:47:20.429]  Any street you go up, I've been all over the city, people with signs everywhere.
[02:47:20.449 --> 02:47:21.589]  You'll see we've got 10,000 here, 5,000 there, 200 here.
[02:47:21.609 --> 02:47:22.170]  It's just everywhere.
[02:47:27.746 --> 02:47:34.210]  The cabbies I've talked to, they say between 50 and 90% of people they've talked to, I get different numbers, hate it that the RNC is here.
[02:47:34.730 --> 02:47:35.511]  There's troops, guys.
[02:47:35.531 --> 02:47:36.872]  Get video of these troops coming.
[02:47:37.312 --> 02:47:38.092]  Zoom in on that, guys.
[02:47:38.132 --> 02:47:38.433]  Right there.
[02:47:38.733 --> 02:47:38.993]  Right there.
[02:47:39.013 --> 02:47:39.473]  There's troops.
[02:47:40.154 --> 02:47:40.694]  Get video of them.
[02:47:40.714 --> 02:47:41.154]  Go over there.
[02:47:41.174 --> 02:47:41.454]  Come on.
[02:47:41.474 --> 02:47:42.735]  Let's go over there and talk to the troops.
[02:47:43.856 --> 02:47:45.957]  I mean, it is just blowing me away.
[02:47:46.578 --> 02:47:55.303]  And there's little gaggles of 2 to 20 National Guard just marching around.
[02:47:55.848 --> 02:47:56.689]  All over the place.
[02:47:56.989 --> 02:47:57.549]  Yeah, that's good.
[02:47:57.569 --> 02:47:59.570]  From here, go ahead and get it from here.
[02:47:59.610 --> 02:48:02.832]  Police State 2004 Live from New York City.
[02:48:02.972 --> 02:48:04.193]  It is Alex Jones.
[02:48:04.874 --> 02:48:08.696]  Paul, you have a comment or you want to ask Alex a question?
[02:48:09.744 --> 02:48:14.246]  Yeah, have you seen any examples of photographers and journalists being arrested?
[02:48:14.286 --> 02:48:22.109]  Because there was an article in the New York Daily News about how filmmakers who were actually filming a movie about protests were not involved in the protests.
[02:48:22.249 --> 02:48:26.911]  Alex is going back with that right after these words.
[02:48:26.931 --> 02:48:32.334]  Filmmakers, are they being arrested right after these words?
[02:48:32.374 --> 02:48:35.115]  This is Alex Jones Radio Program.

[02:49:21.551 --> 02:49:23.434]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:51:58.234 --> 02:52:08.738]  3,000 delegates, 300,000 protesters in a scene that sounds more like the description of chaos reminiscent of Kirk Russell's escape from New York.
[02:52:09.158 --> 02:52:15.041]  It's Alex Jones live from New York, where he is at ground zero.
[02:52:15.721 --> 02:52:23.744]  And the question for Alex from Paul Joseph Watson, author of Order Out of Chaos, and we know what their order is going to be,
[02:52:24.544 --> 02:52:26.866]  Yes, what Paul brought up is totally accurate.
[02:52:26.906 --> 02:52:27.867]  They have these fences.
[02:52:41.636 --> 02:52:44.098]  And they will herd you into a corner and then just arrest everyone.
[02:52:44.138 --> 02:52:47.380]  I'm talking 75-year-old women, people in wheelchairs.
[02:52:47.420 --> 02:52:48.321]  It's indiscriminate.
[02:52:48.621 --> 02:52:51.623]  They grab everybody and put them in paddy wagons.
[02:52:51.903 --> 02:52:59.208]  And then I've got these young kids who are actually stirring up trouble, going, I don't know why, but a police captain and I actually did something and spit on a delegate's car.
[02:52:59.248 --> 02:53:01.910]  Nothing happened to me, but then they arrest everybody and they told me I could go free.
[02:53:01.930 --> 02:53:04.132]  I mean, we have our own videotape saying that.
[02:53:04.152 --> 02:53:08.295]  So you also have useful idiots out doing bad things, and the cops just let them go.
[02:53:09.381 --> 02:53:10.242]  I mean, it's amazing!
[02:53:10.662 --> 02:53:18.606]  And I just had another person walk over to me and go, oh yeah, my family's Navy SEAL, and they called us on September 10th and said they'll go to the World Trade Center tomorrow.
[02:53:18.626 --> 02:53:23.349]  I mean, it's just every five minutes somebody walks over and tells me a new story like this.
[02:53:23.689 --> 02:53:26.991]  Every day I've been out here at Ground Zero, it's just incredible.
[02:53:27.011 --> 02:53:30.013]  These are all New Yorkers who just work right around here.
[02:53:30.513 --> 02:53:33.697]  And people just sit there screaming at the police telling them they know it's the New World Order.
[02:53:33.717 --> 02:53:34.738]  They know who's behind it.
[02:53:34.758 --> 02:53:37.281]  Listen, I'm going to let you guys go and let you have the last word.
[02:53:37.561 --> 02:53:38.122]  God bless you.
[02:53:38.162 --> 02:53:39.644]  I want to thank Harry Brown, Paul Watson.
[02:53:39.844 --> 02:53:41.345]  I want to thank you, Erskine, for coming on.
[02:53:41.365 --> 02:53:43.208]  I want to have Harry Brown sit in in the future.
[02:53:43.228 --> 02:53:44.389]  I want to have Erskine do it.
[02:53:44.409 --> 02:53:45.130]  And just God bless you.
[02:53:46.119 --> 02:53:47.119]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:53:47.179 --> 02:53:48.140]  Take care of yourself.
[02:53:48.560 --> 02:53:49.840]  Take care of yourself.
[02:53:50.220 --> 02:53:51.260]  Let's go to Harry.
[02:53:51.300 --> 02:53:52.500]  Harry, any comments on this?
[02:53:52.540 --> 02:53:53.601]  This is awesome.
[02:53:53.721 --> 02:53:55.381]  This is absolutely awesome.
[02:53:55.501 --> 02:53:56.941]  It is police state.
[02:53:57.322 --> 02:54:07.944]  Well, I've been looking at the web, as I said, while you folks have been talking, and I just don't find any indication in the news that there has been any violence there at all.
[02:54:08.004 --> 02:54:13.005]  In fact, there are specific statements that there has been no violence at all, and some
[02:54:13.645 --> 02:54:20.590]  A woman with the New York Civil Liberties Union said that she acknowledged that the police had been very gentle.
[02:54:21.130 --> 02:54:25.033]  So, it's not really getting into the news, that's for sure.
[02:54:25.493 --> 02:54:27.415]  It's in the foreign news, Harry!
[02:54:27.535 --> 02:54:28.936]  It is in the foreign news!
[02:54:28.996 --> 02:54:33.839]  Now, what is... Well, I looked at BBC and I didn't find anything, but that's as far as I got.
[02:54:35.586 --> 02:54:38.329]  What particular foreign news have you seen?
[02:54:38.349 --> 02:54:38.870]  Guardian?
[02:54:38.950 --> 02:54:42.835]  I have seen it on German, I've seen it on Canadian television.
[02:54:42.895 --> 02:54:48.081]  Both of them are leading off their news stories with the rioting in New York.
[02:54:48.461 --> 02:54:49.743]  Paul, any comments?
[02:54:50.672 --> 02:54:55.318]  Well yeah, I think there's been a couple of reports here on British television which have stories about it.
[02:54:55.898 --> 02:55:08.834]  But the major news line that I've been following is the New York Indy Media news line which carries up to the minute updates on exactly what's going down and they were particularly evident on Tuesday night when there was a lot of trouble.
[02:55:09.235 --> 02:55:09.455]  So if
[02:55:10.536 --> 02:55:14.359]  Listeners, stay focused on the PrisonPlanet.com website tonight.
[02:55:14.839 --> 02:55:23.644]  As I would expect with Bush giving his speech, if there was any real provocative action it would occur tonight, then people keep tuned in to the website.
[02:55:23.664 --> 02:55:26.026]  I will provide them, you know, with any updates as they come in.
[02:55:27.208 --> 02:55:35.710]  So they've got a train all sitting to get Spirit Bush off of Manhattan and out of New York City.
[02:55:36.190 --> 02:55:38.491]  All sitting down below a special train.
[02:55:39.051 --> 02:55:42.452]  This is something when our leaders have to go by.
[02:55:43.012 --> 02:55:46.133]  Underground trains and we've got this type of a situation.
[02:55:46.553 --> 02:55:48.473]  America is in a state of siege.
[02:55:48.533 --> 02:55:49.753]  There's no question about it.
[02:55:50.254 --> 02:55:51.374]  We're scared of the world.
[02:55:51.434 --> 02:55:52.554]  The world is scared of us.
[02:55:52.994 --> 02:55:55.795]  And until we change our foreign policy, that's the way it's going to be.
[02:55:57.012 --> 02:55:57.712]  Amen, Harry.
[02:55:57.732 --> 02:55:58.933]  You're 100% right.
[02:55:59.013 --> 02:56:02.234]  And New World Order is trying to get order out of chaos.
[02:56:02.694 --> 02:56:05.435]  This is elite-sponsored terrorism.
[02:56:05.735 --> 02:56:06.555]  Thank you, Paul.
[02:56:06.695 --> 02:56:12.277]  Thank you so very much, Harry Brown, for being on Alex Jones' radio program.
[02:56:12.297 --> 02:56:13.497]  We'll be back tomorrow.
[02:56:30.495 --> 02:56:30.977]  Yeah.
