[00:00:05.576 --> 00:00:06.216]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.877 --> 00:00:07.938]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:09.760]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.221]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:12.903]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.563 --> 00:00:17.287]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.727 --> 00:00:21.831]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.373 --> 00:00:25.974]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:26.134 --> 00:00:26.574]  We're live.
[00:00:26.674 --> 00:00:27.695]  It's Tuesday.
[00:00:27.835 --> 00:00:29.336]  Tuesday, the 27th of April, 2004.
[00:00:29.436 --> 00:00:31.377]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:31.557 --> 00:00:34.118]  Ultramassive broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:51.221 --> 00:00:56.606]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central during the day, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:00:57.046 --> 00:00:58.628]  Again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:58.648 --> 00:01:11.259]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com, as well as InfoWars.net, JonesReport.com, and VirginUtah.com.
[00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.183]  And all the sites have varying degrees of different areas of key information.
[00:01:17.446 --> 00:01:27.349]  That is, to put it more succinctly, the sites all have a lot of the same information and a lot of different information and video and audio and legislation, you name it.
[00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.190]  Well, I dropped the ball.
[00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:31.531]  And I do this.
[00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:36.733]  I mean, there's so much coming at us that there's no real way to keep track of all of it.
[00:01:38.953 --> 00:01:43.495]  Months ago, a new piece of legislation was introduced.
[00:01:45.417 --> 00:01:55.980]  And it's the legislation that Bush wants to be tagged on this year in the re-passage of Patriot Act 1.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.542]  Now, part of Patriot Act 2 was passed in December, December 13th of 2003.
[00:02:03.682 --> 00:02:06.722]  Well, now they've introduced new legislation
[00:02:13.872 --> 00:02:16.775]  And let me give you the bill number on this.
[00:02:17.856 --> 00:02:18.176]  H.R.
[00:02:18.196 --> 00:02:18.176]  2934.
[00:02:18.716 --> 00:02:22.159]  It's posted on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:23.340]  We just posted it.
[00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:26.403]  Terrorist Penalties Enhancement Act of 2003.
[00:02:26.823 --> 00:02:30.506]  And we have the subsection here in front of us.
[00:02:30.886 --> 00:02:38.773]  Patriot Act Enhancement provides death penalty for any federal crime punishable by one year in jail.
[00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:47.741]  Well, that means any federal crime, because all the federal crimes, the lowest penalty is one year.
[00:02:48.941 --> 00:02:54.502]  And there are just millions of different things the government can come after you for.
[00:02:54.642 --> 00:02:58.043]  Literally millions of different laws.
[00:02:58.103 --> 00:03:00.384]  Not hundreds of thousands, but millions.
[00:03:00.464 --> 00:03:04.985]  No one really knows the total number, they just know it's over a million
[00:03:05.757 --> 00:03:32.601]  different federal laws and of course there are then millions of state laws no one knows the government says they don't know how many just that there's over a million there as well so Patriot Act enhancement provides death penalty for any federal crime punishable by over one year in jail remember the Oregon law they tried to pass where if you block traffic or protest or
[00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.751]  own a gun illegally or download music.
[00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:38.693]  I mean, it listed over a hundred things.
[00:03:38.733 --> 00:03:43.976]  You get life in prison in a forest labor camp.
[00:03:43.996 --> 00:03:48.619]  What was that, Bill 742 in Oregon?
[00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.481]  That's posted on the site as well, InfoWars.com.
[00:03:51.501 --> 00:04:02.908]  In fact, Paul Watson, our webmaster over at the Prison Planet side, he did get that Oregon bill and a few others and posted in with this counterpunch article that we've now added to
[00:04:04.065 --> 00:04:12.911]  So when we get back, I want to go over this new enhancement of the Patriot Act and how we can hopefully expose it and stop it.
[00:04:13.491 --> 00:04:29.382]  And we'll also talk about the troops, the CIA-controlled troops in a special division went into this perfume factory where they said there were chemicals that could be used for explosives or chemical weapons.
[00:04:29.762 --> 00:04:31.143]  Well, anything could be used for that.
[00:04:31.906 --> 00:04:34.288]  And it blew up a supposedly movie trap!
[00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.592]  And now the neocons are out saying, my goodness!
[00:04:38.892 --> 00:04:39.493]  We did it!
[00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:43.036]  We found the weapons of mass destruction, but it got blown up!
[00:04:43.356 --> 00:04:44.417]  It was precursors!
[00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:50.663]  Well, I mean, ammonia under your sink can be the precursor of a chemical weapon.
[00:04:51.264 --> 00:04:53.065]  And they've tried this several times before.
[00:04:53.085 --> 00:04:55.287]  It's just amazing levels of lies.
[00:04:55.948 --> 00:04:57.089]  And it's getting our troops killed.
[00:04:57.109 --> 00:04:57.629]  We'll be back.
[00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:58.330]  Please stay with us.
[00:05:00.962 --> 00:05:07.807]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:09.508]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:09.688 --> 00:05:11.889]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:12.049 --> 00:05:14.131]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:14.411 --> 00:05:19.354]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:23.717]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:23.957 --> 00:05:25.738]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:05:25.818 --> 00:05:36.460]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.501]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:05:38.721 --> 00:05:42.562]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the info war.

[00:07:02.364 --> 00:07:07.847]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:07:08.268 --> 00:07:12.510]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:19.774]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:07:20.155 --> 00:07:26.278]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:26.418 --> 00:07:27.619]  There are no side effects.
[00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:30.902]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:07:31.063 --> 00:07:33.085]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:07:33.385 --> 00:07:40.633]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:07:40.933 --> 00:07:44.317]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:07:44.737 --> 00:07:54.182]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625.
[00:07:54.202 --> 00:07:54.522]  866-885-6625.
[00:07:54.802 --> 00:07:59.064]  One more time that's 866-885-6625 call today.
[00:08:02.305 --> 00:08:08.348]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues.
[00:08:08.969 --> 00:08:11.930]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:13.649 --> 00:08:18.753]  Alright, again it's the 27th day of April 2004 on this live Tuesday edition.
[00:08:18.773 --> 00:08:22.776]  We're now 8 minutes and 35 seconds into this first hour.
[00:08:22.796 --> 00:08:26.019]  Later we've got the lawyer for the 70 plus year old lady
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:50.066]  There at her mother's house, the 95-year-old lady with the SWAT teams beating her up, tasering her three times and knocking out her false eye.
[00:08:50.786 --> 00:09:01.674]  Because at least once a week I like to focus in on one of these police state developments and just show the insane mentality that we didn't see in this country just a decade ago that is intensifying.
[00:09:03.795 --> 00:09:09.359]  In the meantime, I want to get into the latest developments in Iraq, also with the police state here domestically.
[00:09:10.603 --> 00:09:16.728]  The Fallujah scene of intense gun battles in other cities, Marines and Army troops being killed.
[00:09:18.409 --> 00:09:19.810]  Some U.S.
[00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:32.879]  Army troops, quote, under CIA control, along with some Marines, were sweeping through an area, went in a perfume factory, and first they were saying that it was chemicals in there to make explosives.
[00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:35.741]  Now they're saying it could have been precursors to chemical weapons.
[00:09:37.481 --> 00:09:44.325]  Well, according to those parameters, almost everything under your kitchen sink is a precursor, including ammonia.
[00:09:45.145 --> 00:09:47.726]  The point here is, is they've tried this over and over again.
[00:09:47.746 --> 00:09:53.549]  There must have been, I don't know, 20 times during the last year where they said, oh, we found some barrels.
[00:09:53.609 --> 00:09:54.810]  We think it's chemical weapons.
[00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:55.670]  Oh, we found them!
[00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.631]  And then, oh, it's fertilizer.
[00:09:58.272 --> 00:10:00.993]  Or, oh, we found some chemicals in another chemical plant.
[00:10:01.193 --> 00:10:02.834]  Oh, it's an oil refinery.
[00:10:04.139 --> 00:10:06.660]  I mean, any of this stuff can be used to make explosives.
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.361]  That's not weapons of mass destruction.
[00:10:08.981 --> 00:10:21.226]  I mean, I love before the war, the UN inspectors unscrewing rockets and sticking their noses in it on video and still photographs and, you know, the news headlines, searching for weapons of mass destruction.
[00:10:21.266 --> 00:10:25.327]  These may be Sarin or VX nerve gas rockets.
[00:10:25.387 --> 00:10:29.869]  Well, you don't unscrew them and stick your nose in the tip of the warhead.
[00:10:31.229 --> 00:10:33.529]  I mean, you don't do that with protective gear on.
[00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:40.071]  You test the outside of it, and if it's got chemicals in it, it'll come up with a red flag.
[00:10:40.471 --> 00:10:45.892]  Then you take it to be destroyed very carefully to an incinerator.
[00:10:46.772 --> 00:10:49.593]  A specially designed incinerator in Alabama.
[00:10:50.253 --> 00:10:53.393]  They supposedly got one in Israel as well to get rid of this stuff.
[00:10:53.574 --> 00:10:55.514]  You don't unscrew it and stick your nose in it.
[00:10:55.734 --> 00:10:56.614]  I mean, it's a joke.
[00:10:56.674 --> 00:11:00.875]  We have a Pentagon that's been caught, again, planting hundreds of fake
[00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:07.189]  Letters from troops with false signatures, fake weapons dossiers written thirteen years ago.
[00:11:07.209 --> 00:11:12.892]  At the time, twelve years before, now it's been another year, so thirteen years ago.
[00:11:13.393 --> 00:11:21.798]  Niger fake documents about uranium, mobile weapons trucks that turn out to be for pumping up dirigibles, balloons, blimps, whatever you want to call them.
[00:11:23.359 --> 00:11:30.864]  They've known all this all along, but I hear the neocons all over talk radio last night and this morning just crowing
[00:11:31.539 --> 00:11:33.561]  That we found the chemical weapons.
[00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:34.762]  Maybe.
[00:11:34.922 --> 00:11:35.643]  Precursors.
[00:11:35.863 --> 00:11:36.383]  Could be.
[00:11:37.284 --> 00:11:38.425]  So it's interesting.
[00:11:38.485 --> 00:11:47.633]  But all of that, frankly, pales in significance to our government arming North Korea, arming China, arming Pakistan.
[00:11:48.814 --> 00:11:51.557]  What looks like an attempted hit on Kim Jong-il.
[00:11:53.521 --> 00:12:00.766]  Rumsfeld releasing three separate battle plans saying that we want to have a preemptive strike on him, which is trying to push him to go ahead and nuke us.
[00:12:01.126 --> 00:12:12.535]  He's got missiles that can hit any part of the U.S., and out of this they'll get their World War III, and then through that crisis the military-industrial complex will control what's left of the free economy globally.
[00:12:13.716 --> 00:12:17.959]  But on top of all of this, I just learned of this!
[00:12:19.045 --> 00:12:28.631]  I mean, there's Patriot Act 1 and 2, there's Victory Act 1 and 2, there's the Intelligence Act of 2003 that did pass.
[00:12:28.691 --> 00:12:35.636]  I mean, there's all this legislation, and all that I knew had passed was Patriot Act 1, October 27, 2001, Patriot Act 2 introduced, January 6, 2002, wow, excuse me, 2003,
[00:12:48.909 --> 00:12:53.350]  And, again, they took part of Patriot Act II and got it passed.
[00:12:53.990 --> 00:13:05.573]  It was passed the week before December 13, 2003, and Bush signed it December 13, 2003, the day they announced the Saddam capture, so that news got kind of blacked out.
[00:13:06.713 --> 00:13:10.534]  And we've gone over what's in this legislation, past and ending.
[00:13:12.719 --> 00:13:38.938]  But I dropped the ball here and so did everybody else and I went online last night when I first discovered it at PrisonPlanet.tv Paul Watson had found it over at Counterpunch run by the LA Times writer Alexander Cockburn and we found the actual bill and it's worse than what their analysis states and it ties into the other pieces of legislation
[00:13:39.782 --> 00:13:42.144]  So this is on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:13:42.204 --> 00:13:48.930]  I've also written an addendum or a blurb at the beginning of it at InfoWars.com.
[00:13:50.211 --> 00:13:58.278]  Patriot Act enhancement provides a death penalty for any federal crime punishable by over one year in jail.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:04.384]  And lo and behold, while I was being interviewed by Jeff Rents on his show,
[00:14:05.569 --> 00:14:13.314]  I half-distractedly, and I apologize, whenever I learned of this an hour into the show, I went to the bill and was reading it while on air.
[00:14:13.374 --> 00:14:20.499]  And sure enough, it certainly does say this, and we have the bill and the subsection posted at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:14:20.599 --> 00:14:27.864]  In fact, I would tell Paul he's doing a great job to also take the bill that we grabbed and my comment and post it with a Counterpunch article.
[00:14:28.505 --> 00:14:34.569]  This is a great story out of Counterpunch, so I will read this in its entirety as well.
[00:14:36.047 --> 00:14:37.368]  But, think about this.
[00:14:38.229 --> 00:14:41.791]  If you violate any of the federal laws, and there's well over a million of them.
[00:14:43.273 --> 00:14:49.337]  A million different laws and what they call laws, it's all color of law, in the federal code.
[00:14:50.898 --> 00:14:57.063]  Patriot Act enhancement provides a death penalty for any federal crime punishable by over one year in jail.
[00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:03.528]  Now, when I wrote my analysis in early last year,
[00:15:04.657 --> 00:15:08.598]  Of Patriot Act 2, and it did win the Project Censored Award.
[00:15:08.638 --> 00:15:10.659]  I'm not bragging, but it's accurate.
[00:15:10.699 --> 00:15:19.361]  They had a whole bunch of professors and academics and lawyers study my analysis and were shocked that it was accurate because it was incredible claims.
[00:15:19.421 --> 00:15:24.723]  I said that, well, here's the subsection where they'll secretly execute you for any act of terrorism.
[00:15:25.863 --> 00:15:31.304]  And then they pointed back to Section 802 of the first Patriot Act that said it's any action that endangers human life.
[00:15:31.364 --> 00:15:33.125]  It's a violation of any federal or state law.
[00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:46.669]  So according to that, according to what the code says, and the way a lawyer would read it, or a judge would read it, or a tribunal would read it, any misdemeanor is punishable by execution, secret execution, no trial.
[00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:57.177]  But now in this new enhancement of the Patriot Act, Patriot Act Enhancement Act, they actually clearly state it.
[00:15:58.898 --> 00:16:02.561]  But they say that it's any violation of a federal law,
[00:16:03.662 --> 00:16:32.353]  uh... that would give you uh... over one year in jail which every federal crime I've ever looked at I mean it's normally pretty stiff penalties I don't ever see them uh... shorter than a year unless you're some junk bond salesman who's friends with the Bush's or the Clinton's then you know then you get a week or two at some uh... golf course style minimum security facility so when you hear oh it's just for the terrorists when you hear that it's
[00:16:33.351 --> 00:16:35.013]  You know, not for the American people.
[00:16:35.073 --> 00:16:35.213]  Why?
[00:16:35.253 --> 00:16:36.254]  This is just for terrorists.
[00:16:36.274 --> 00:16:39.497]  You're not for, you know, protecting the terrorists.
[00:16:39.537 --> 00:16:40.818]  They don't deserve rights.
[00:16:41.358 --> 00:16:45.882]  What people don't understand is this is written for the entire population.
[00:16:47.304 --> 00:16:58.654]  And it takes away due process and allows the criminals, the despots in government, to literally have Soviet-slash-Nazi-like powers over our lives.
[00:17:01.764 --> 00:17:09.790]  So again, keeping up with the lies of the Bush administration, something that Steve Perry has been doing at Bush Wars, would be a full-time job.
[00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:20.278]  In order to maintain my sanity, I focus only on lies about civil liberties until recently, Attorney General John Ashcroft had been the fund... the fraudmeister.
[00:17:21.676 --> 00:17:45.752]  But fueled by 9-11 commission hearings, the panel Bush did not want to begin with, and the steady stream of administration talking heads, Bushes who tout the Patriot Act as the companion of laws that will save us from terrorism, Bush's handlers have come to the recognition that touting the Patriot Act is a mighty fine re-election campaign tool.
[00:17:45.872 --> 00:17:50.875]  After all, it is amply named so that if you're not for it, you are unpatriotic.
[00:17:52.006 --> 00:17:55.469]  Last week, Bush made two speeches about the Patriot Act.
[00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:57.430]  One in New York City, one in Buffalo.
[00:17:58.111 --> 00:17:59.892]  Also thought he made one in Pennsylvania.
[00:18:00.433 --> 00:18:18.147]  The Buffalo speech focused on how the law of Lackawanna 6, young American citizens of Yemen, descent who never engaged in one act of terrorism, but made the dumb mistake of going to Afghanistan and returning to study Islam before September 11th, used it to nab the bad guys before they could hurt us.
[00:18:19.053 --> 00:18:20.494]  Nothing could be further from the truth.
[00:18:20.534 --> 00:18:32.221]  The Patriot Act itself cannot be tied to any terrorism convictions, mostly guilty pleas, other than the fact that it defines terrorism so broadly that my writing this article equals a terrorist act.
[00:18:32.381 --> 00:18:36.964]  Ergo, traveling to a terrorist country before September 11th makes you a terrorist.
[00:18:37.964 --> 00:18:46.750]  And it goes on to say the ACLU, whose loyal opposition, I would add, has saved me the trouble of cataloging and contradicting Bush's lies about the Patriot Act.
[00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:47.110]  Quote,
[00:18:47.944 --> 00:18:53.867]  The President said, by the way, the reason I bring up the Patriot Act, it's set to expire next year.
[00:18:53.987 --> 00:18:58.449]  I'm starting a campaign to make it clear to members of Congress that it shouldn't expire.
[00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:01.251]  It shouldn't expire for the security of our country.
[00:19:02.031 --> 00:19:05.993]  That way when they blow something else up, they can say, see, you stopped us from protecting you.
[00:19:06.494 --> 00:19:06.934]  The truth!
[00:19:07.434 --> 00:19:15.538]  Less than 10% of the Patriot Act expires, most of the law is permanent, and those portions that do sunset will not do so until December 31st, 2005.
[00:19:17.566 --> 00:19:18.867]  I'm glad somebody pointed this out.
[00:19:18.887 --> 00:19:22.069]  I pointed this out over two years ago when they first passed Patriot Act 1.
[00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:30.455]  The sunset provision is for just a few of the header provisions that say we love everybody and we're not going to take your freedoms and we care about you.
[00:19:31.095 --> 00:19:33.136]  All the real provisions are not sunsetted.
[00:19:33.176 --> 00:19:33.897]  They're in perpetuity.
[00:19:34.777 --> 00:19:36.979]  The President said, and that changed,
[00:19:37.941 --> 00:19:41.962]  The law changed on roving wiretaps were available for chasing down drug lords.
[00:19:42.022 --> 00:19:44.163]  They weren't available for chasing down terrorists.
[00:19:44.223 --> 00:19:44.543]  See?
[00:19:44.943 --> 00:19:45.363]  The truth!
[00:19:45.804 --> 00:19:49.145]  Roving wiretaps were available prior to 9-11 against drug lords and terrorists.
[00:19:49.525 --> 00:19:54.306]  Prior to the law, the FBI could get a roving wiretap against both when it provided probable cause.
[00:19:54.586 --> 00:19:59.268]  We'll come back and finish up going through this and get to the best part, executing you for no reason.
[00:20:01.189 --> 00:20:04.471]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:20:04.531 --> 00:20:08.714]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:20:08.954 --> 00:20:11.736]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:20:11.936 --> 00:20:14.338]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:20:14.518 --> 00:20:23.163]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:20:23.363 --> 00:20:24.724]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:20:24.904 --> 00:20:29.087]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:20:29.407 --> 00:20:30.167]  We're good to go!
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.521]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:00.682 --> 00:21:02.363]  I'm taking collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:21:02.463 --> 00:21:04.965]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[00:21:05.145 --> 00:21:05.845]  It feels great.
[00:21:06.025 --> 00:21:07.086]  Absolutely wonderful.
[00:21:07.146 --> 00:21:12.690]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:14.511]  Kimberly, tell us about your success.
[00:21:14.811 --> 00:21:17.153]  Okay, I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[00:21:17.293 --> 00:21:20.395]  I've lost 16 pounds and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[00:21:20.575 --> 00:21:21.256]  Incredible!
[00:21:21.436 --> 00:21:22.778]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[00:21:22.818 --> 00:21:26.422]  I'm a 21-month-old child and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[00:21:26.502 --> 00:21:27.303]  Well, that's for sure.
[00:21:27.463 --> 00:21:28.044]  Was it easy?
[00:21:28.264 --> 00:21:28.885]  Very easy.
[00:21:28.925 --> 00:21:29.806]  I mean, there's nothing to it.
[00:21:29.826 --> 00:21:35.012]  You can actually still continue to eat meals with your children and not starve yourself or anything else and lose weight.
[00:21:35.572 --> 00:21:41.493]  You can lose fat the safe and healthy way, just like Kimberly did with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:21:41.834 --> 00:21:42.914]  Call right now, 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:21:42.974 --> 00:21:43.374]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:21:43.394 --> 00:21:47.035]  Remember, mention you heard it right here, and that gets you $25 off a three-month supply.
[00:21:47.055 --> 00:21:48.655]  So call Vim and Vigor today, 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:21:48.675 --> 00:21:49.195]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:21:49.215 --> 00:21:51.056]  Hi, this is Jack Browner with a gold alert from Midas Resources.
[00:22:04.332 --> 00:22:06.354]  Folks, it's time to shed your complacency.
[00:22:06.714 --> 00:22:09.316]  Gold has seldom, if ever, been a better buy.
[00:22:09.676 --> 00:22:14.220]  Midas Resources is now in a position to potentially show you considerable profits.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.202]  But you have to act now!
[00:22:16.402 --> 00:22:22.587]  We have $10 collector gold coins at the closest price to melt I have seen in my 24 years in the business.
[00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:29.511]  These are the same coins that are likely to soon command substantial premium prices as they have in the past.
[00:22:29.751 --> 00:22:33.292]  We can deliver them to you now with minimal downside risk.
[00:22:33.532 --> 00:22:36.973]  Or we can let you buy them later at a considerable higher price.
[00:22:37.413 --> 00:22:39.673]  Don't buy them later, folks.
[00:22:40.053 --> 00:22:40.873]  Do it now.
[00:22:41.113 --> 00:22:43.334]  That's $10 collector gold coins.
[00:22:43.714 --> 00:22:50.475]  $10 and $20 collector gold coins at the nearest amount in my 24 years in this business called Midas Resources.
[00:22:50.862 --> 00:22:51.544]  800-686-2237 That's Midas at 800-686-2237
[00:23:00.231 --> 00:23:01.231]  It's finally here!
[00:23:01.371 --> 00:23:02.352]  Spring has arrived!
[00:23:02.552 --> 00:23:05.492]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:23:05.712 --> 00:23:09.173]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:23:09.393 --> 00:23:17.535]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:23:17.795 --> 00:23:21.536]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[00:23:21.756 --> 00:23:26.757]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[00:23:27.037 --> 00:23:31.539]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[00:23:31.739 --> 00:23:35.800]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:43.023]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn!
[00:23:43.323 --> 00:23:48.786]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious, secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[00:23:48.986 --> 00:23:50.887]  Call the Ark Institute toll free at 800-255-1912.
[00:23:50.907 --> 00:23:52.207]  That's 1-800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com today.
[00:23:52.227 --> 00:23:53.388]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:23:53.408 --> 00:23:54.508]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:18.695 --> 00:24:27.077]  Coming up in the next segment, I'll get back into this new Patriot Act legislation.
[00:24:27.137 --> 00:24:27.657]  H.R.
[00:24:27.677 --> 00:24:29.617]  2934 of the Terrorist Penalties Enhancement Act.
[00:24:31.197 --> 00:24:38.559]  Laws such as the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act and the Federal Gun Control Regime of Title 18 U.S.C.
[00:24:38.619 --> 00:24:46.640]  Section 922, among many other crimes, could carry death sentences if a bill is passed, one of the top lawyers for the ACLU said.
[00:24:47.526 --> 00:24:57.729]  So the ACLU looking at these sections says this will allow them to execute pro-life demonstrators, and it says Greenpeace activist, and it lists the U.S.
[00:24:57.769 --> 00:24:58.329]  Code here.
[00:24:59.249 --> 00:25:09.072]  A catch-all death penalty for any other federal crime punishable by more than one year in prison if it meets the Patriot Act's overbroad definition of terrorism.
[00:25:11.639 --> 00:25:14.720]  So, that's... again, we'll just get into this later.
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:17.642]  It's just a whole can of worms, so serious.
[00:25:19.062 --> 00:25:25.145]  But going to Paul Watson just briefly, I drug him onto the broadcast to talk about two breaking stories.
[00:25:25.965 --> 00:25:39.351]  First off, they're claiming that troops went in and might have found a chemical weapons plant with precursors to chemical weapons, and then also new developments concerning cover-ups in the numbers of dead U.S.
[00:25:39.371 --> 00:25:39.671]  troops.
[00:25:39.731 --> 00:25:39.951]  Paul?
[00:25:40.836 --> 00:25:41.717]  Good to be on the air, Alex.
[00:25:41.977 --> 00:25:42.577]  Good to have you on.
[00:25:43.818 --> 00:25:48.561]  Yeah, the story that you wanted me to mention is out of the Associated Press.
[00:25:49.281 --> 00:25:54.625]  And it says, an explosion in northern Baghdad today killed two soldiers during a U.S.
[00:25:54.705 --> 00:25:54.945]  raid.
[00:25:54.965 --> 00:25:59.808]  The blast leveled part of a building after American troops entered it and wrecked four Humvees.
[00:26:00.468 --> 00:26:02.970]  Witnesses say the explosion happened after U.S.
[00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:05.852]  troops broke into a shop on the ground floor to search the building.
[00:26:06.474 --> 00:26:11.740]  Some residents say the building housed a weapons repair shop, while others say it was a perfume factory.
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:18.907]  But Insight Magazine's reporting that it was basically a chemical weapons factory.
[00:26:19.668 --> 00:26:25.574]  World Net Daily's got a story right at the top of their page which says Saddam's WMD have been found.
[00:26:26.611 --> 00:26:31.654]  Well, they've jumped on it all, even though the eyewitnesses who lived there said it was a perfume factory.
[00:26:31.774 --> 00:26:46.341]  Well, it's like, before the war, they go, here's the chemical weapons plant in up-and-curd-controlled areas, which Saddam didn't even control, and then they send reporters to it, and it's a broken-down bakery, with some goats eating some stubble on the ground.
[00:26:47.234 --> 00:26:58.769]  I mean, they're all over the place going, we found the chemical weapons, we found it, because they say they went in there and a bomb went off, they found nothing, no teams have been there, the government's not even saying it, but their surrogates are, Paul.
[00:26:58.789 --> 00:27:00.611]  Well, that's the case.
[00:27:00.631 --> 00:27:03.154]  It's all on the Neocon Newswire's book.
[00:27:04.331 --> 00:27:10.757]  If it was an actual find of anything, then it'd be all over, you know, ABC News, CNN, which it's not at the moment.
[00:27:11.017 --> 00:27:12.818]  So I see these kind of things every week.
[00:27:13.159 --> 00:27:16.682]  I basically just ignore them, because they always turn out to be unsubstantial.
[00:27:16.722 --> 00:27:19.984]  And six months from now, the neocons will be going, why doesn't the media report?
[00:27:20.064 --> 00:27:20.765]  They're liberals.
[00:27:20.805 --> 00:27:24.008]  We found a chemical plant in downtown Baghdad.
[00:27:24.648 --> 00:27:28.311]  It's some little shop, and there's a booby trap, and they go, oh, chemical weapons.
[00:27:28.371 --> 00:27:29.993]  I mean, it's getting really ridiculous.
[00:27:30.959 --> 00:27:38.065]  Well, some of them are still talking about, you know, n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n
[00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:09.826]  They were flown in a massive amount of refrigeration tanks and empty coffins and then as the war began and up to this very day, eyewitnesses there on the ground and security guards who work there
[00:28:10.165 --> 00:28:10.825]  We're good to go.
[00:28:29.655 --> 00:28:31.176]  500 bodies of U.K.
[00:28:31.236 --> 00:28:31.696]  and U.S.
[00:28:31.736 --> 00:28:36.558]  soldiers were secretly hidden in a morgue in Shabazz Air Base in Jacobad.
[00:28:36.898 --> 00:28:42.060]  And then we have them trying to cover up the coffins and putting up the blue screens when the coffins are brought off the planes.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:50.683]  And Paul, this is important because we have a history of the Pentagon covering things up.
[00:28:51.263 --> 00:28:54.084]  They've been caught covering things up in the past, and here's an example.
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.401]  Yesterday they claimed four Humvees were destroyed.
[00:28:57.741 --> 00:29:01.222]  In foreign papers it said there were dead, burning troops in all these vehicles.
[00:29:01.502 --> 00:29:06.764]  They described it as a huge explosion in Baghdad, but then they claim only two troops died in it?
[00:29:07.244 --> 00:29:08.744]  I mean, that doesn't make sense.
[00:29:08.864 --> 00:29:14.826]  Four burning vehicles, the building totally destroyed, a whole squad goes in, but only two died, Paul.
[00:29:15.993 --> 00:29:20.576]  Well, at the same time, they're reporting that 64 insurgents were killed.
[00:29:21.037 --> 00:29:26.221]  So, I mean, how can 64 of, you know, those get killed and only two soldiers get killed?
[00:29:27.382 --> 00:29:30.304]  Even with the body armour and all that kind of thing, it would be more than two.
[00:29:30.784 --> 00:29:34.647]  But also, out of the Arab papers, and I see this every week,
[00:29:35.362 --> 00:29:40.386]  More and more deaths of American troops both in Afghanistan still and in Iraq.
[00:29:40.426 --> 00:29:44.169]  And we've got another report, 12 American Marines executed in Fallujah.
[00:29:44.469 --> 00:29:47.211]  Anyway, let's spend just a few more minutes on this on the other side, Paul.
[00:29:47.231 --> 00:29:49.713]  Then I'll get into Patriot Act 2 and all the other news.
[00:29:51.554 --> 00:29:52.515]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.955 --> 00:29:54.556]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.477 --> 00:29:58.159]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.334 --> 00:30:08.856]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:30:09.137 --> 00:30:22.121]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[00:30:22.401 --> 00:30:25.682]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:30:26.042 --> 00:30:36.510]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:37.311]  That's right!
[00:30:37.491 --> 00:30:44.596]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:30:44.896 --> 00:30:51.021]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10.
[00:30:52.202 --> 00:30:57.024]  We're calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:30:57.264 --> 00:31:01.285]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:31:01.426 --> 00:31:04.207]  What kind of gift can you give to someone who has everything?
[00:31:04.607 --> 00:31:05.687]  Are you running out of ideas?
[00:31:06.167 --> 00:31:06.768]  Out of time?
[00:31:07.248 --> 00:31:10.429]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?
[00:31:11.127 --> 00:31:13.969]  Well, think of a song, written especially for them.
[00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:22.194]  And all you have to do is go to www.songsforever.com and provide us all the information about that special someone.
[00:31:22.615 --> 00:31:25.917]  Interesting facts, unique things about him, and all you can think of.
[00:31:26.277 --> 00:31:34.282]  Songsforever.com will use that information brought to us by you to compose a unique song with original lyrics inspired by everything you've told us.
[00:31:34.842 --> 00:31:35.343]  Just listen.
[00:31:43.714 --> 00:31:48.900]  Birthday coming soon?
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:50.001]  Anniversary?
[00:31:50.501 --> 00:31:51.222]  Wedding perhaps?
[00:31:51.823 --> 00:31:52.784]  Mother's Day's coming up?
[00:31:53.344 --> 00:31:57.308]  Just go to www.songsforever.com.
[00:31:57.749 --> 00:32:00.051]  That's www.songsforever.com.
[00:32:01.585 --> 00:32:03.946]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:32:04.206 --> 00:32:08.028]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:32:08.348 --> 00:32:09.168]  Read the labels.
[00:32:09.609 --> 00:32:13.731]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:32:13.951 --> 00:32:18.133]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:32:18.513 --> 00:32:23.375]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:32:23.775 --> 00:32:27.357]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:32:27.538 --> 00:32:32.881]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:32:33.161 --> 00:32:35.883]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:32:36.183 --> 00:32:37.084]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:32:37.384 --> 00:32:48.111]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[00:33:14.724 --> 00:33:14.824]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:14.844 --> 00:33:18.645]  What do you think of the expansion of the Patriot Act that Bush was out promoting last week?
[00:33:18.685 --> 00:33:20.686]  Turns out we got a copy of this new bill, H.R.
[00:33:20.706 --> 00:33:22.586]  2934, the Terrorist Penalties Enhancement Act of 03,
[00:33:38.268 --> 00:33:44.409]  Patriot Act Enhancement provides a death penalty for any federal crime punishable by over a year in jail.
[00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:51.191]  Now, they say if it's dangerous to life or kill somebody, but then you go back to the U.S.
[00:33:51.251 --> 00:33:59.133]  Code, back to the definition of terrorism, it's any action that endangers human life that's a violation of any federal or state law.
[00:33:59.253 --> 00:34:00.633]  So that was already stated
[00:34:01.383 --> 00:34:06.927]  But they were unable to then pass the death penalty provision in Patriot Act 2.
[00:34:07.508 --> 00:34:12.271]  They did pass some of the provisions, and now they've got it tagged onto this new legislation.
[00:34:12.291 --> 00:34:15.554]  But first, going back to Paul Joseph Watson briefly.
[00:34:16.094 --> 00:34:24.200]  Paul, continuing with the 12 Troops Executed article that we're not hearing about in our media.
[00:34:25.416 --> 00:34:37.828]  Yeah, it says, according to the details, a Rantisi Brigade, an Iraqi resistance group named in honour of the late leader of Hamas, who was murdered by Israeli forces, managed to surround a small unit of US soldiers.
[00:34:38.309 --> 00:34:46.877]  Taking them captive, they took the 12 to the roof of a nearby building and systematically shot them, throwing the bodies from the rooftop to the ground below.
[00:34:46.897 --> 00:34:48.879]  So that's been reported.
[00:34:49.726 --> 00:34:53.189]  In the Arab media, but only one and now two dead U.S.
[00:34:53.249 --> 00:34:53.990]  Marines have been reported.
[00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:55.271]  Well, I have to be honest.
[00:34:56.392 --> 00:35:03.338]  In many cases, the Arab media turns out to be more accurate than our supposed mainstream media.
[00:35:03.759 --> 00:35:05.680]  It's horrible what's happening to our troops.
[00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:12.026]  And I know that for at least five years, Vietnam was a secret war.
[00:35:13.132 --> 00:35:15.054]  And they say that at least 8,000 U.S.
[00:35:15.495 --> 00:35:20.781]  troops of the 58,000 died during those secret years.
[00:35:20.921 --> 00:35:23.043]  So there is a precedent for this.
[00:35:23.103 --> 00:35:27.288]  I know we've lost hundreds of troops in the war over
[00:35:28.707 --> 00:35:57.098]  uh... the opium and cocaine uh... plantations in the communist-controlled area of columbia the globalists don't spray uh... the the so-called capitalist sector they spray the fire that's controlled by the communists and that's what the war goes on and remember the mercenaries uh... shooting down the uh... uh... the uh... christian uh... evangelists that were down there oh what's the term what do you call it when uh...
[00:35:57.896 --> 00:36:16.388]  Missionaries are shooting them down and then that spins into another point that there have been conservatively hundreds of mercs, or mercenaries, dying in Afghanistan, Colombia, in the Philippines, in Iraq, and we never hear about those numbers, Paul.
[00:36:16.948 --> 00:36:18.089]  Now, I've got this report.
[00:36:18.129 --> 00:36:22.472]  Tell folks about the source of this report about the 12 American troops executed.
[00:36:23.513 --> 00:36:25.514]  Source is free Arab voice.
[00:36:26.181 --> 00:36:36.288]  I mean, these kind of publications report every week in Afghanistan, which Bush told us was now a democracy, that basically it's on the verge of civil war.
[00:36:36.408 --> 00:36:38.329]  And that was also in The Guardian two weeks ago.
[00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:49.817]  And weekly I read these reports where there are Taliban attacks on American bases, twelve dead troops, in some cases dozens of dead troops.
[00:36:49.857 --> 00:36:51.658]  Well, seven days ago today,
[00:36:55.297 --> 00:36:58.340]  This NFL Cardinals player died over there.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:04.625]  Yeah, the numbers are more so than what is being reported.
[00:37:04.685 --> 00:37:13.192]  And then we have all these other stories about hidden stashed bodies away in foreign countries like Cyprus and back in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[00:37:13.993 --> 00:37:16.435]  That's 5,000 just on this latest report alone.
[00:37:16.455 --> 00:37:17.956]  And we're supposed to believe that
[00:37:18.917 --> 00:37:19.538]  What is it now?
[00:37:20.078 --> 00:37:23.100]  800, 900 troops have died in Iraq so the numbers are being covered up.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.082]  One more thing though... By the way, that's a spin they do.
[00:37:26.162 --> 00:37:31.305]  That's since the supposed Bush declaring victory on the aircraft carrier.
[00:37:31.945 --> 00:37:33.246]  That's how many have died since then.
[00:37:33.266 --> 00:37:35.147]  That's correct.
[00:37:35.687 --> 00:37:36.588]  One more thing though.
[00:37:37.108 --> 00:37:44.073]  I'm about to post on PrisonPlanet.tv within an hour yet another report on bombs in the World Trade Center.
[00:37:44.413 --> 00:37:47.735]  We've got audio clips from CBS News Channel 2 in New York.
[00:37:48.371 --> 00:38:01.143]  And the journalist was in a chopper as both the towers collapse and in both cases he describes secondary explosions before the towers collapse and we got the audio clips so they'll be posted within an hour.
[00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:07.833]  Well, that's great news, Paul, and I would also add our WTC7 analysis page.
[00:38:08.453 --> 00:38:15.257]  I would add the other clips of people saying this, the firefighters saying that there were bombs going off.
[00:38:15.277 --> 00:38:25.963]  We need to have all this in one place because people go to the site and see one article about one thing, one article about another, and I think it really loses some of its effect of the full spectrum of evidence.
[00:38:27.063 --> 00:38:30.385]  Yeah, we've also got a subsection in the 9-11 archive which is
[00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:37.593]  Bombs in the World Trade Center, but that archive's so giant that most people can't find anything in it without searching for an hour or so.
[00:38:38.093 --> 00:38:40.594]  Yeah, all those stories will be posted on the same page.
[00:38:41.194 --> 00:38:43.435]  Well, that's the problem, is we have too much evidence.
[00:38:43.615 --> 00:38:57.560]  It's just, you know, I hope this isn't true about them covering up numbers of dead troops, but I know they're doing it to a certain degree, Paul, because, you know, say a few weeks ago, we're in four days, 85 troops died,
[00:39:00.091 --> 00:39:05.534]  And how the media reported it was, 5 dead here, 12 dead there, 10 dead here, 7 dead here.
[00:39:05.554 --> 00:39:09.476]  They kept reporting it in pieces, never putting it all together.
[00:39:09.817 --> 00:39:17.241]  That gave the perception of lower numbers, and then later in the back of the paper, they give us the big total of 85 dead troops in one week.
[00:39:18.061 --> 00:39:21.864]  And I've talked to family who's been in and out of country over there.
[00:39:22.284 --> 00:39:24.046]  They say it's a lot worse than what we're hearing.
[00:39:24.366 --> 00:39:31.231]  And the woundings, just the non-fatal casualties, are supposedly a lot higher as well.
[00:39:31.772 --> 00:39:33.813]  And then they're not even being given proper health care.
[00:39:33.853 --> 00:39:38.777]  They're people with legs blown off, waiting months to have anything done for them.
[00:39:39.898 --> 00:39:42.180]  And they're also being given rotten meals.
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:43.461]  The word is that
[00:39:44.028 --> 00:39:58.799]  The families of these dead Americans, that they're trying to cover up the fact that they died, are being told that they're on some kind of secret mission, which means that they can't communicate with them for, you know... I did hear that on ABC News last night.
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:09.908]  I went to the store after I got off the rents program, and I was driving, and I heard them say, oh, these crooks run a secret CIA program, so they can't talk to the media, and we can't give you the numbers.
[00:40:09.988 --> 00:40:11.609]  It's a secret operation.
[00:40:12.939 --> 00:40:22.384]  So, in, you know, four or five years, when these families are still not in contact with their sons and daughters, they'll be told that they, you know, died in an accident, so that's how they're going to cover it up in the future.
[00:40:22.464 --> 00:40:32.529]  Yeah, a lot of times, we've been told to cover up numbers of dead in combat, we'll suddenly hear about three or four C-130s colliding in the space of a few days.
[00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:37.951]  You know, it's just horrible, Paul, and people are doubting this.
[00:40:38.071 --> 00:40:39.012]  We have a government,
[00:40:40.235 --> 00:40:48.080]  Lance, Weapons of Mass Destruction stories, how many times, I mean just over and over again, that puts fake news articles in the media.
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:55.344]  The Pentagon's Office of Strategic Information told us two years ago they were going to lie to us for our own good, Paul.
[00:40:56.665 --> 00:41:06.191]  Well that's correct, and I mean that all this unrest in Iraq is again being fostered by the very forces who are controlling our troops and sacrificing our troops in there.
[00:41:07.121 --> 00:41:07.461]  U.S.
[00:41:07.681 --> 00:41:11.203]  using cluster bombs in Fallujah, Jerusalem Post.
[00:41:11.763 --> 00:41:15.964]  Spokesman for an Iraqi delegation from the violence-gripped city of Fallujah accused U.S.
[00:41:15.984 --> 00:41:20.185]  troops of using intentionally banned cluster bombs against the city.
[00:41:20.946 --> 00:41:27.488]  So, basically killing women and children, and we had another four children shot dead on the weekend.
[00:41:27.668 --> 00:41:33.770]  By the way, yesterday they blew up part of a mosque, one of the four spires, one of the corner towers,
[00:41:35.015 --> 00:41:41.385]  And I hear the neocons, you know, months ago saying, kill everybody in Fallujah, level the city.
[00:41:42.046 --> 00:41:43.829]  And I've made the point, it's a town of 300,000.
[00:41:45.011 --> 00:41:48.557]  If somebody down the road from you brutally murders four people,
[00:41:49.446 --> 00:41:51.407]  And, you know, hangs them from a bridge.
[00:41:51.827 --> 00:41:52.987]  You expect the U.S.
[00:41:53.147 --> 00:41:57.268]  Army to circle your city and start indiscriminately killing people.
[00:41:57.628 --> 00:42:00.829]  I mean, what's wrong with the neocons' mindset of their listeners?
[00:42:01.169 --> 00:42:07.251]  And then on top of that, blowing up mosques is not going to get our troops out of there.
[00:42:07.611 --> 00:42:11.712]  It's like slapping a beehive with a two-by-four repeatedly.
[00:42:12.693 --> 00:42:17.354]  Well, I was talking about going back into Fallujah and bombarding it again, but as you mentioned,
[00:42:17.853 --> 00:42:34.844]  Day after the slaughter of the workers in Fallujah, where their bodies were strung up, Joseph Farah of WorldNetDaily wrote an editorial where he said that we should salt the earth like the Romans did and flatten the city.
[00:42:35.505 --> 00:42:43.270]  So now we aspire to be like the Roman Empire, both in name and in tactics, so that's what the neocons are calling for.
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:49.385]  Which, again, Farah will come out and say the Patriot Act's bad, I can't vote for Bush, he's for open borders.
[00:42:49.885 --> 00:42:54.589]  They'll say a lot of things that are true, and then mixed in there, let's destroy the entire city.
[00:42:54.609 --> 00:42:59.713]  I mean, I've heard the talk show hosts, their listeners, let's kill everyone, kill them, nuke them, nuke them!
[00:42:59.873 --> 00:43:01.194]  I mean, do you really mean that?
[00:43:02.495 --> 00:43:12.704]  Look, when our troops first went in, it is true, most of the Iraqis were apprehensive, they were on the fence, they were waiting and watching.
[00:43:13.365 --> 00:43:18.807]  Now, small groups led by Chalibi did stage celebrations with a few hundred here, a few hundred there.
[00:43:19.147 --> 00:43:20.887]  There is a minority that was for us.
[00:43:21.647 --> 00:43:23.348]  There is a minority that is against us.
[00:43:23.548 --> 00:43:24.468]  That was at the beginning.
[00:43:24.848 --> 00:43:29.569]  And the vast majority in the polls and the interviews were, we're waiting to see.
[00:43:29.609 --> 00:43:34.911]  We don't like Saddam, but if the Americans give us the vote and leave us alone, we'll thank them.
[00:43:35.575 --> 00:43:39.137]  But now our so-called allies, the Shiites, are fighting us.
[00:43:39.197 --> 00:43:40.298]  It's not one cleric.
[00:43:40.638 --> 00:43:41.459]  It's a whole bunch of them.
[00:43:41.719 --> 00:43:46.342]  So they can't say it's some sneaky Al-Qaeda group going around controlling all of this.
[00:43:47.482 --> 00:43:52.145]  It is the policies a year later... I mean, the people are sick of it, folks!
[00:43:52.645 --> 00:43:56.147]  And it's only going to get more of our troops killed, and Bush says, bring it on!
[00:43:57.588 --> 00:43:58.009]  Well, yes.
[00:43:58.989 --> 00:44:03.492]  Probably Americans would have a similar reaction if some dictator came and invaded America.
[00:44:03.973 --> 00:44:04.834]  You know, with an army.
[00:44:05.975 --> 00:44:15.464]  Like the Iraqis, they were used to having a dictator, so most of them being sort of, you know, not involved in politics or anything, would just sit back and watch what was going on.
[00:44:16.184 --> 00:44:21.529]  Because they're used to having a dictator, so they would acquiesce to any new dictator who came in and took over.
[00:44:21.969 --> 00:44:27.915]  But now, with the tactics that have been used, flattening cities, blowing up mosques, killing women and children,
[00:44:28.758 --> 00:44:33.242]  And that's had the reaction to bring up this real resistance.
[00:44:33.322 --> 00:44:40.167]  Yeah, eight months ago, they started bulldozing whole tangerine, whole date farms in poor communities.
[00:44:40.187 --> 00:44:47.293]  You know, if one person shot at the Marines or the Army, they would come in and bulldoze a bunch of houses, bulldoze.
[00:44:47.393 --> 00:44:51.576]  And the women would just sit there and say, well, I'm waiting to die with my children.
[00:44:52.477 --> 00:44:53.478]  There's no food.
[00:44:53.858 --> 00:44:55.820]  So of course that's going to cause this.
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:56.240]  And look,
[00:44:57.423 --> 00:44:59.044]  You can say, well, good, do that to them.
[00:44:59.324 --> 00:45:00.604]  That's what the Nazis did.
[00:45:00.645 --> 00:45:01.625]  I thought they were bad.
[00:45:02.065 --> 00:45:08.848]  You know, the Nazis tortured, the Nazis arrested all the men, the Nazis bulldozed fields, and you know, burned fields.
[00:45:09.768 --> 00:45:14.730]  And so, just because the Nazis in Israel do it, doesn't mean it's okay for us to do it.
[00:45:16.511 --> 00:45:24.894]  Well, I mean, they're taking the leaf out of any, you know, tyrannical army in history that have gone into another country, invaded it, and raped and pillaged the population.
[00:45:25.515 --> 00:45:33.077]  It's just like a P-2-O-G, you know, stimulating reactions by being so excessively forceful.
[00:45:33.638 --> 00:45:35.618]  Tell people what a P-2-O-G is.
[00:45:36.839 --> 00:45:49.703]  Well, it was a plan out of the pensing and it was reported in the Asia Times whereby terrorist organizations would be stimulated by killing members of their family.
[00:45:50.382 --> 00:45:51.103]  We're good to go.
[00:46:09.722 --> 00:46:11.844]  In Iraq, the memo got leaked.
[00:46:11.904 --> 00:46:13.545]  It's confirmed to be accurate.
[00:46:14.005 --> 00:46:15.506]  And he said, look, I'm for this war.
[00:46:15.586 --> 00:46:19.169]  I'm for what we're doing, but our tactics are causing all this resistance.
[00:46:19.469 --> 00:46:20.509]  This isn't working.
[00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:25.273]  And he said, I'm sure that the Pentagon people know this from all of our experiences.
[00:46:25.613 --> 00:46:26.554]  Why are we doing it?
[00:46:26.614 --> 00:46:32.398]  Because we have to crush them, make them hate us, so the UN can be accepted as the savior.
[00:46:34.799 --> 00:46:38.422]  And now there's more discussion of NATO going in, along with the UN.
[00:46:39.893 --> 00:46:48.737]  And, of course, the more troops are needed, the more the call will be for the draft, especially when they go ahead and invade these other countries that are on the PNAC list.
[00:46:48.977 --> 00:46:51.898]  North Korea, Syria, Iran, even China, ultimately.
[00:46:52.338 --> 00:46:58.120]  So it's a beta test for the future tactics that they will use to stir up all this unrest.
[00:46:58.641 --> 00:47:00.241]  It's an order out of chaos.
[00:47:00.641 --> 00:47:01.082]  That's it.
[00:47:01.142 --> 00:47:04.903]  Paul, thank you for joining us and thanks for your work at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:47:05.563 --> 00:47:06.344]  Okay, thanks, Alex.
[00:47:06.484 --> 00:47:07.384]  Take care, my friend.
[00:47:07.744 --> 00:47:09.405]  Who's up first here, Stephanie?
[00:47:10.902 --> 00:47:13.464]  Anthony in Louisiana, then Debbie, Neil, and others.
[00:47:14.304 --> 00:47:15.125]  Anthony, go ahead.
[00:47:15.145 --> 00:47:16.746]  Hi, Alex.
[00:47:17.046 --> 00:47:24.771]  I'm calling about, you had addressed a couple of times in the past, the Hubbard Peak production and how it's a sham.
[00:47:25.591 --> 00:47:25.831]  Yes.
[00:47:26.392 --> 00:47:39.240]  Okay, well look, I've read a lot about it, I've read a lot that tore it apart and tried to discredit it, but in Scientific American, unless this is supposed to be a propaganda rag... The same folks that tell us we have global warming.
[00:47:39.833 --> 00:47:41.395]  Well, okay, fine.
[00:47:41.816 --> 00:47:46.323]  But anyway, neither you or I are geophysicists.
[00:47:46.764 --> 00:47:48.666]  Well, I have family, that is.
[00:47:49.207 --> 00:47:53.233]  Okay, and they say that this whole theory is just a bunch of bunk, or what?
[00:47:53.574 --> 00:47:55.036]  Yeah, I mean, I've talked to oil companies.
[00:47:56.246 --> 00:48:05.388]  You know, high-level managers, they're not CEOs or anybody, but people that are, you know, over-drilling, over-refineries, and they're finding so much oil, it's a joke!
[00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:14.211]  Okay, so you... well, you had said in the past that there's a whole bunch of oil still in Texas and Alaska... Well, I just read the BBC article.
[00:48:14.511 --> 00:48:16.511]  Did you hear me on Friday read the BBC?
[00:48:17.352 --> 00:48:17.712]  Uh, no.
[00:48:17.772 --> 00:48:18.452]  No, I haven't, actually.
[00:48:18.472 --> 00:48:21.693]  There was a big headline about, you know, record oil supplies.
[00:48:22.347 --> 00:48:23.108]  Okay.
[00:48:23.308 --> 00:48:24.870]  And also, I wanted to ask... Look, look, look, look.
[00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:30.336]  I had what you'd call a classical liberal, a real liberal, not one of the phony ones, Greg Palastone.
[00:48:30.877 --> 00:48:31.097]  Yeah.
[00:48:31.197 --> 00:48:31.738]  BBC.
[00:48:32.178 --> 00:48:39.707]  And he talked about how he talks to oil company execs, you know, Saudi intelligence chiefs, and they're laughing about it.
[00:48:39.747 --> 00:48:41.629]  I mean, there's so much oil, it's a joke.
[00:48:42.313 --> 00:48:52.185]  Okay, uh, is this issue, is this the main reason why you and, uh, and Mike Rupert do not get along or about in your views and you, and you say stuff about each other and blah blah blah?
[00:48:52.285 --> 00:48:52.746]  Is this it?
[00:48:53.006 --> 00:48:54.408]  What, is he still saying stuff about me?
[00:48:55.508 --> 00:48:57.250]  Yeah, he is on the internet.
[00:48:57.810 --> 00:49:00.092]  Look, I don't care about Mike Rupert.
[00:49:00.412 --> 00:49:02.234]  I am curious.
[00:49:02.334 --> 00:49:03.515]  Sir, you just asked me a question.
[00:49:03.535 --> 00:49:04.356]  You want an answer to it?
[00:49:04.776 --> 00:49:05.016]  Yeah.
[00:49:05.337 --> 00:49:06.297]  I have nothing against Mike.
[00:49:06.317 --> 00:49:07.558]  I think he does a lot of great work.
[00:49:08.119 --> 00:49:10.661]  I had the guy on my show probably, I don't know, 15 times.
[00:49:11.642 --> 00:49:14.925]  Did nothing but promoting, and then suddenly he wrote the hit piece on me.
[00:49:15.545 --> 00:49:19.966]  Saying that the Patriot Act II didn't have the things I said was in it, and then I won the project.
[00:49:19.986 --> 00:49:20.286]  Yeah, you did.
[00:49:20.526 --> 00:49:20.967]  Yeah, I read.
[00:49:21.047 --> 00:49:21.447]  Let me finish.
[00:49:21.467 --> 00:49:22.307]  Thanks for the call.
[00:49:22.327 --> 00:49:23.167]  I'm going to let you go.
[00:49:23.667 --> 00:49:30.189]  Then, I posted a rebuttal that dissected it, and I won the Project Centered Award for it.
[00:49:30.229 --> 00:49:31.809]  It's been all over the news what's in it now.
[00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:33.430]  So, I don't care.
[00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:34.290]  It's a diversion.
[00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:35.410]  It's a distraction.
[00:49:35.811 --> 00:49:36.591]  End of discussion.
[00:49:36.711 --> 00:49:37.951]  I don't get into infighting here.
[00:49:38.331 --> 00:49:41.452]  I just am not going to have this broadcast as a platform for what he does.
[00:49:41.752 --> 00:49:44.673]  But I don't not believe in peak oil because he believes in it.
[00:49:45.949 --> 00:49:52.353]  I don't believe in peak oil because they're finding giant reserves that have more oil than Iraq all the time.
[00:49:52.474 --> 00:50:01.120]  In Russia, in the Stans, Tazikistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, in Alaska, there's oil all over the U.S.
[00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:04.843]  Now is it sweet crude that comes squirting out like it does in Saudi Arabia?
[00:50:05.123 --> 00:50:05.924]  Most of it isn't.
[00:50:07.325 --> 00:50:11.688]  I mean there's just so much energy, but they want to create artificial scarcity.
[00:50:13.129 --> 00:50:13.910]  I talk about
[00:50:15.498 --> 00:50:16.578]  That is the old companies do.
[00:50:16.758 --> 00:50:22.300]  I talk about this because I remember five years ago seeing the UN talk about it.
[00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:24.501]  Creating artificial scarcity.
[00:50:25.001 --> 00:50:27.421]  This broadcast is about exposing the Patriot Act.
[00:50:27.701 --> 00:50:29.162]  It's about exposing the open borders.
[00:50:29.422 --> 00:50:30.982]  It's about exposing gun control.
[00:50:31.302 --> 00:50:38.044]  It is not about the favorite sport of most so-called freedom fighters of fighting with each other.
[00:50:38.184 --> 00:50:38.744]  I won't do it.
[00:50:39.905 --> 00:50:40.225]  Okay?
[00:50:41.345 --> 00:50:44.246]  And, you know, that's the end of it.
[00:50:44.853 --> 00:50:46.614]  That's all I have to say about it.
[00:50:46.634 --> 00:50:47.975]  Okay.
[00:50:48.035 --> 00:50:54.819]  Now we'll come back and talk to Debbie and Neil and others, and we've got a guest coming up, and I'll get back into this new Patriot Act legislation.
[00:50:55.279 --> 00:50:56.500]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:51:01.403 --> 00:51:05.725]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.905 --> 00:51:10.268]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:12.501 --> 00:51:14.863]  Use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.903 --> 00:51:17.666]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:51:18.026 --> 00:51:22.250]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.310 --> 00:51:29.256]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.396 --> 00:51:31.398]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.618 --> 00:51:42.146]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.386 --> 00:51:47.730]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:02.802]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[00:52:02.882 --> 00:52:13.590]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:18.493]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:52:18.553 --> 00:52:29.902]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:52:30.482 --> 00:52:37.327]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:52:37.727 --> 00:52:39.849]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:52:40.349 --> 00:52:45.333]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[00:52:45.633 --> 00:52:51.798]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:51.818 --> 00:52:52.918]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you!
[00:52:52.958 --> 00:52:53.819]  That's toll free!
[00:52:59.343 --> 00:52:59.863]  I think so.
[00:53:17.888 --> 00:53:18.489]  I think so.
[00:53:38.148 --> 00:53:40.989]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:14.864 --> 00:54:17.805]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to Debbie in Michigan.
[00:54:17.845 --> 00:54:19.285]  Debbie, go ahead, thanks for holding.
[00:54:19.645 --> 00:54:20.505]  Hi, how are ya?
[00:54:20.705 --> 00:54:21.005]  Fine.
[00:54:21.585 --> 00:54:38.429]  Um, I could make a comment on your oil statement, but the real question I want to know is, um, what are they going to do with, okay, I've been studying how they did, what they did in Germany with Nazis and all that, and how they went in and killed the disabled and the old people because they called them useless eaters.
[00:54:39.272 --> 00:54:47.119]  And then in the Nuremberg Trials, they used Margaret Sanger's handbooks and correspondence commending Hitler as their reason for doing it.
[00:54:47.139 --> 00:54:49.842]  They said, hey, we learned this from you.
[00:54:50.923 --> 00:55:02.474]  Well, yeah, but what I'm saying is, with the way things are going right now with the Patriot Act and the war and all this other stuff, it seems like we're following in step with what they did before.
[00:55:02.494 --> 00:55:03.515]  It's like a blueprint.
[00:55:04.133 --> 00:55:21.240]  Well, yeah, it's like Homeland Security, is the translation from German, and the Reich Security, meaning land security, or the Gestapo, and the police wear the black uniforms, they have the same setup, yeah, they're following that model.
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:30.303]  Right, well, see, I'm disabled, you know, I've got senior citizens for parents, and I'm thinking to myself, my gosh, we're following in line.
[00:55:30.643 --> 00:55:32.684]  We are literally following almost to the letter.
[00:55:33.243 --> 00:55:35.345]  What they did over there with the propaganda?
[00:55:35.365 --> 00:55:51.322]  Well, have you seen all the articles, even in the Wall Street Journal, where they're killing people who are begging for food and water because they signed a, you know, a, don't give me aid if I'm in a coma, and then they consider not being able to feed yourself being comatose?
[00:55:51.382 --> 00:55:56.507]  I mean, that's been in the Wall Street Journal listing the names of the people that they're killing coast to coast.
[00:55:56.747 --> 00:56:00.931]  Well, that's how I started on this was with the Terri Schiavo thing down in Florida.
[00:56:00.991 --> 00:56:02.373]  I decided to research it.
[00:56:02.393 --> 00:56:04.234]  With Terri, she's not in a vegetative state.
[00:56:04.254 --> 00:56:06.997]  She's not in a coma, but she can't really talk or move.
[00:56:07.177 --> 00:56:07.357]  Right.
[00:56:07.377 --> 00:56:08.679]  She's got cerebral palsy.
[00:56:08.719 --> 00:56:13.884]  But in these other cases, it's people saying, honey, can I please have some water?
[00:56:14.224 --> 00:56:14.865]  Thanks for the call.
[00:56:14.905 --> 00:56:15.846]  Good to hear from you, Debbie.
[00:56:16.266 --> 00:56:19.029]  We'll come back and go to Neil, John, Sean, and others.
[00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:31.422]  And then we do have a guest coming on, the lawyer for this 70-plus-year-old lady who got tasered three times and beat up, basically protecting her 95-year-old mother.
[00:56:32.603 --> 00:56:35.363]  And the police, they felt threatened by her and had to do this.
[00:56:35.463 --> 00:56:38.224]  So it's big news in Oregon.
[00:56:38.664 --> 00:56:40.124]  I'm not just attacking the police.
[00:56:40.224 --> 00:56:47.726]  I'm against this thuggish mentality where they're so in fear that they end up brutalizing the citizenry.
[00:56:49.665 --> 00:56:55.412]  Before I end this hour, you heard Paul Watson talk about PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:56:56.113 --> 00:56:58.756]  Every week we put up a 30 minute to an hour long

[00:57:50.823 --> 00:57:56.325]  I have George Humphrey books and his books on CD, very professionally produced.
[00:57:57.186 --> 00:58:02.748]  We have Eric Huffschmid's book and video concerning 9-11 that is just amazing.

[00:58:46.475 --> 00:58:47.235]  Please stay with us.
[00:58:52.242 --> 00:58:55.246]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:58:55.587 --> 00:59:04.418]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:59:04.739 --> 00:59:09.425]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:59:09.865 --> 00:59:16.588]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:59:17.008 --> 00:59:28.773]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:59:29.253 --> 00:59:33.717]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[00:59:42.103 --> 00:59:42.724]  Big Brother.
[00:59:59.386 --> 01:00:00.426]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:01.146 --> 01:00:02.267]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.907 --> 01:00:03.727]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.467 --> 01:00:05.387]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:06.047 --> 01:00:09.728]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.228 --> 01:00:14.349]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.571 --> 01:00:22.571]  All right, my friends.
[01:00:25.095 --> 01:00:51.791]  We're now into the second hour of this Tuesday edition, and I want to get into the Patriot Act legislation that Bush is out promoting, the headline from Counterpunch, Patriot Act Enhancement Provides Death Penalty for Any Federal Crime Punishable by Over One Year in Jail.
[01:00:54.734 --> 01:00:56.275]  Very, very serious.
[01:00:56.515 --> 01:01:02.779]  Also, the government covering up the real numbers of our dead and dying troops.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.921]  We'll also be getting into that.
[01:01:06.642 --> 01:01:09.003]  But first, I want to talk a little bit about Oregon.
[01:01:10.424 --> 01:01:18.950]  Out in Oregon, the police, especially in Portland, have gotten very, very aggressive.
[01:01:21.585 --> 01:01:29.909]  And it's gotten so bad that yesterday we read several editorials with local news channels getting very upset about what's happening.
[01:01:31.089 --> 01:01:43.335]  In fact, in one article, and we've got a guest coming up here in just a few minutes to discuss this, the lawyer of this poor lady, in one article, the headline of the Oregonian, even blind old ladies terrify the police
[01:01:44.324 --> 01:02:00.483]  She needed her 94-year-old mother to come to her rescue, and in the middle of the dogfight in which Eunice Crowder was pepper-sprayed, tasered and knocked to the ground by Portland's courageous men in blue, the poor woman's fake right eye popped out of its socket and was bouncing around on the dirt.
[01:02:01.471 --> 01:02:15.219]  The cops aren't apologizing, the cops aren't embarrassed, the cops haven't been disciplined, and the cops still are insisting for the better end that they quote reasonably believe this blind old woman was a threat to their safety and macho culture.
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:20.963]  And look, I'm a clean-cut looking guy, you know, short hair, white guy.
[01:02:20.983 --> 01:02:29.148]  I won't even hardly go down to Sixth Street anymore because some steroid goon with more tattoos than Marilyn Manson
[01:02:29.804 --> 01:02:41.273]  With giant, you know, arms and a shaved head will come up and, you know, back when I wasn't married and have a girlfriend down there would start demanding to see their ID and saying, you look pretty good, honey.
[01:02:42.514 --> 01:02:44.295]  I mean, I knew thugs who were bouncers.
[01:02:44.315 --> 01:02:46.797]  You could see them the next year as the police.
[01:02:46.898 --> 01:02:48.419]  Just bullies.
[01:02:48.559 --> 01:02:51.121]  The same bully from the schoolyard with a badge and a gun.
[01:02:51.541 --> 01:02:54.944]  And with unlimited authority comes unlimited tyranny.
[01:02:56.005 --> 01:02:56.185]  Now,
[01:02:57.765 --> 01:03:04.806]  Ernest Warren is the lawyer, the attorney for Eunice Crowder, and he's here to tell us this story.
[01:03:06.987 --> 01:03:08.447]  Sir, thank you for coming on the show.
[01:03:08.807 --> 01:03:12.768]  Thank you, Mr. Jones, for having me.
[01:03:13.548 --> 01:03:14.508]  Well, thank you for joining us.
[01:03:15.329 --> 01:03:20.610]  We're about to break, but in a nutshell, what is going on in Portland, Oregon?
[01:03:23.194 --> 01:03:43.723]  There's been a public outcry of the excessive force that police use against pretty much everyday people like my client, Eudice Crowder, who was a white, 71-year-old, blind woman, hard of hearing, who hadn't committed any crime.
[01:03:43.783 --> 01:03:49.926]  But by the end of the beating that they gave her, and as you had somewhat described,
[01:03:50.732 --> 01:04:02.675]  They charged her with criminal conduct and it was my job to both defend her against the criminal allegations and to get her compensated for the excessive force that was used against her.
[01:04:03.055 --> 01:04:06.075]  Now in the past you just got a beating from bad police.
[01:04:06.115 --> 01:04:08.536]  Now we have video of this all over the country.
[01:04:08.896 --> 01:04:15.157]  They beat you up, you never touch them, but then they go ahead and charge you with assaulting them and resisting them.
[01:04:15.637 --> 01:04:16.177]  Exactly.
[01:04:16.837 --> 01:04:19.058]  And that's exactly what happened in this case.
[01:04:20.004 --> 01:04:24.765]  And what makes this even more outrageous is it happened in her own home.
[01:04:25.966 --> 01:04:30.407]  Her yard had become somewhat overgrown.
[01:04:31.707 --> 01:04:32.687]  I've seen pictures of it.
[01:04:32.727 --> 01:04:34.028]  It didn't look that bad to me.
[01:04:34.208 --> 01:04:34.828]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[01:04:34.868 --> 01:04:35.448]  Stay there, sir.
[01:04:35.488 --> 01:04:36.248]  We've got a break.
[01:04:36.328 --> 01:04:37.289]  Long segment coming up.
[01:04:37.329 --> 01:04:38.409]  Plenty of time to get into this.
[01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:43.530]  We're talking to Ernest Warren, her lawyer, who just did get a $145,000 settlement, which I say isn't enough.
[01:04:47.317 --> 01:04:48.621]  And just an amazing story.
[01:04:48.681 --> 01:04:49.404]  Stay there, my friend.
[01:04:49.424 --> 01:04:50.086]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:55.962 --> 01:05:01.445]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:05:01.886 --> 01:05:06.108]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:05:06.348 --> 01:05:13.392]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:05:13.773 --> 01:05:19.876]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:05:20.016 --> 01:05:21.237]  There are no side effects.
[01:05:21.577 --> 01:05:24.520]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:26.701]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:05:27.002 --> 01:05:34.248]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:05:34.548 --> 01:05:37.931]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:44.993]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[01:05:45.013 --> 01:05:46.614]  866-885-6625.
[01:05:46.634 --> 01:05:48.134]  866-885-6625.
[01:05:48.414 --> 01:05:50.615]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:05:52.035 --> 01:05:52.656]  Call today.
[01:05:53.376 --> 01:05:57.697]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:57.897 --> 01:06:02.299]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:02.439 --> 01:06:03.699]  There is a chance
[01:06:04.475 --> 01:06:06.857]  Use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:06:06.897 --> 01:06:09.780]  The New World Order can emerge.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.224]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:21.230]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:21.350 --> 01:06:23.352]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:23.612 --> 01:06:34.140]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:39.724]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:06:59.438 --> 01:07:05.642]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[01:07:46.281 --> 01:07:55.028]  Alright, Neil and John and Sean and many others that are patiently holding, we're going to get your calls a little bit later in this hour, early in this hour.
[01:08:15.666 --> 01:08:22.191]  Also, we'll be getting into this new Patriot Act legislation where they'll execute you if you violate their federal laws.
[01:08:23.712 --> 01:08:28.536]  Also, the situation in Iraq as we track the police state here.
[01:08:29.496 --> 01:08:32.699]  But listen, every day, I'm not just bashing the police.
[01:08:32.979 --> 01:08:36.962]  Every day, I get an article where a family drives off
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:49.608]  And the cops shoot the vehicle up and shoot the children, or blow a pregnant woman away, or kill some old lady at the wrong house, or splatter somebody for no reason, and plant a gun on them and get caught doing it.
[01:08:50.168 --> 01:08:56.793]  And for every one cop that gets caught, I guarantee you there's 500 doing something wrong, because the culture's set up to cover it up.
[01:08:57.073 --> 01:09:00.195]  But now, when they get out of control and beat you up,
[01:09:00.795 --> 01:09:07.117]  In almost every case I've seen, they go ahead and charge you with something to legitimize what they've done, and that's wrong.
[01:09:07.137 --> 01:09:12.278]  I mean, if they're going to beat us, which I think is their right as our owners, that's okay.
[01:09:12.699 --> 01:09:15.379]  But don't punish us after they enjoy themselves.
[01:09:15.659 --> 01:09:19.360]  I mean, I agree that they've got some stress, and beating us up is their right.
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:20.181]  We're their property.
[01:09:20.501 --> 01:09:21.561]  Okay, I'm being sarcastic.
[01:09:21.901 --> 01:09:27.803]  But I'm tired of being treated like a slave, and we're joined by Ernest Warren, the lawyer for Eunice Crowder.
[01:09:28.925 --> 01:09:31.626]  71-year-old lady there with her 95-year-old mother.
[01:09:32.446 --> 01:09:34.907]  Sir, you just won a settlement of $145,000.
[01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:49.052]  The community's outraged, but for people that don't know about this story, and again, it's a long laundry list in Portland, Oregon, go over just what's been happening in Portland, Oregon, and then specifically what happened to your client.
[01:09:49.572 --> 01:09:57.775]  Well, what happened is, I think you should know that in traffic stops, two people have been killed in less than one year.
[01:09:58.590 --> 01:10:00.091]  By the cops.
[01:10:00.731 --> 01:10:19.918]  In one case that happened just a month ago, 25 seconds into a traffic stop for failing to signal for 100 feet before making a left turn, they killed Mr. Perez by firing three shots into his chest within 25 seconds.
[01:10:20.338 --> 01:10:23.699]  And witnesses asked, why are you stopping me for?
[01:10:23.879 --> 01:10:26.620]  And he wasn't aggressive and he didn't have any weapon.
[01:10:27.529 --> 01:10:37.838]  And the police officer was just acquitted in a grand jury because he said he believed that Mr. Perez was going for a gun and there was no gun to be found.
[01:10:37.899 --> 01:10:39.860]  And this is in broad daylight.
[01:10:40.361 --> 01:10:46.827]  And there were several witnesses who not only who actually tape recorded the whole incident.
[01:10:48.288 --> 01:10:52.832]  And this and the May 5th of last year, a young 120 pound
[01:10:54.514 --> 01:11:00.298]  Five-two woman who was a passenger in a car, Kendra James, was also killed by the police.
[01:11:00.438 --> 01:11:02.779]  We have a photo of her with her two small children.
[01:11:02.819 --> 01:11:03.560]  She was pregnant.
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.061]  That's correct.
[01:11:05.341 --> 01:11:18.329]  And she was killed by the police, again, for nothing more than a misdemeanor that one of the cops that had stopped her a couple of weeks before.
[01:11:18.730 --> 01:11:22.372]  You know, you don't have to go to a grand jury to get a misdemeanor complaint.
[01:11:22.652 --> 01:11:23.953]  The cop just goes down and
[01:11:24.542 --> 01:11:35.289]  Swears out an affidavit and then you got a crime against you, well that's what happened in the situation in arresting her from the rear of the car they killed her.
[01:11:36.689 --> 01:11:52.479]  And the question is, she didn't have a weapon and she was unarmed and most men could grab a woman 120 pounds and get her out of the car without pulling out a gun, without pulling out a taser, or without pulling out a can of peppermace.
[01:11:53.638 --> 01:11:55.479]  Let's go into Eunice Crowder's case.
[01:11:55.599 --> 01:11:59.301]  On June 9, 2003, 11 a.m.
[01:11:59.401 --> 01:12:03.082]  right before noon, Eunice gets a knock at her door.
[01:12:03.162 --> 01:12:10.005]  It's a bureaucrat from the city of Portland that's serving her with an administrative search warrant to clean up her yard.
[01:12:11.606 --> 01:12:14.087]  Eunice tells him, Sonny, I'm blind.
[01:12:14.607 --> 01:12:15.508]  I'm 71 years old.
[01:12:15.548 --> 01:12:16.388]  I'm hard of hearing.
[01:12:16.908 --> 01:12:18.349]  Could you read this warrant to me?
[01:12:19.122 --> 01:12:21.924]  I don't understand why a warrant should be executed upon me.
[01:12:22.124 --> 01:12:23.644]  By the way, this is all in the newspaper.
[01:12:23.724 --> 01:12:28.367]  He took that as not respecting, basically, the gang member.
[01:12:28.667 --> 01:12:29.828]  It's a gang mentality.
[01:12:30.048 --> 01:12:32.769]  And so for not showing respect to the gang member, what happened?
[01:12:33.309 --> 01:12:38.892]  He balls it up into a piece of paper and hands it to her and says, I don't have to do that.
[01:12:39.793 --> 01:12:41.814]  And now she's beside herself.
[01:12:41.854 --> 01:12:43.054]  Well, what are you going to take?
[01:12:43.515 --> 01:12:45.275]  And she's trying to stay behind him.
[01:12:45.336 --> 01:12:48.077]  And she knows every square corner of her home.
[01:12:48.593 --> 01:12:55.814]  She has a prosthesis in her right eye, and she has 21,000 vision in her left.
[01:12:57.034 --> 01:13:01.175]  And what we used to say is she's blind in one eye and can't see out the other.
[01:13:01.595 --> 01:13:04.136]  Yeah, basically that's the vision of a mole.
[01:13:04.656 --> 01:13:15.818]  And she basically had a family heirloom in the front yard, which it was a 90-year-old, you know, the first-made radio flyer wagon.
[01:13:16.578 --> 01:13:17.758]  And she had rhododendrons
[01:13:18.314 --> 01:13:19.335]  We're good to go.
[01:13:43.345 --> 01:13:46.787]  They say, on the back of a trailer in front of your driveway.
[01:13:46.827 --> 01:13:48.387]  She says, can I get on the trailer?
[01:13:49.008 --> 01:13:49.628]  They say, no.
[01:13:50.268 --> 01:13:54.050]  She says, well, can you as a bureaucrat for the city get on the trailer?
[01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:56.711]  He says, no, liability purposes.
[01:13:57.111 --> 01:13:57.691]  Who can?
[01:13:58.152 --> 01:13:58.672]  The police.
[01:13:59.572 --> 01:14:01.553]  I have my cell phone here in Braille.
[01:14:01.593 --> 01:14:02.574]  You got a number for them?
[01:14:02.614 --> 01:14:03.454]  No, I'll call.
[01:14:03.914 --> 01:14:05.075]  They'll come much quicker.
[01:14:06.135 --> 01:14:07.616]  Well, she says, I'm going to sit here.
[01:14:07.656 --> 01:14:08.476]  I'm going to protest.
[01:14:08.496 --> 01:14:09.837]  I'm going to have one foot on the
[01:14:10.439 --> 01:14:14.182]  On the bumper of this trailer and one foot on this curb until they come.
[01:14:15.243 --> 01:14:18.906]  And she just sits there, you know, and she calls her mother on her cell phone.
[01:14:18.946 --> 01:14:20.687]  Let me stop you before you go any further.
[01:14:21.428 --> 01:14:28.153]  We've seen these many times in Austin, where they retroactively then zone an area that was in the country.
[01:14:28.593 --> 01:14:31.756]  Say you've got to get your stuff out of the yard, even yards that aren't a mess.
[01:14:32.449 --> 01:14:38.151]  Then they come out and steal everything you've got and then charge you thousands of dollars for stealing your stuff.
[01:14:38.691 --> 01:14:40.091]  Is that what was happening here?
[01:14:40.711 --> 01:14:42.432]  That was exactly what was happening.
[01:14:42.512 --> 01:14:50.854]  In fact, one of the things that they did was assess a $700 fine for cleaning up a 100 by 50 lot.
[01:14:52.455 --> 01:14:53.355]  Well, that's nothing, sir.
[01:14:53.435 --> 01:14:54.475]  I've seen it upwards of $14,000.
[01:14:59.096 --> 01:15:01.278]  Well, I was pretty amazed there.
[01:15:01.418 --> 01:15:02.258]  Oh, that's bad enough.
[01:15:02.278 --> 01:15:08.622]  So you've got a blind old lady taking care of her 95-year-old mother, taking care of each other, and she doesn't lick this guy's boots.
[01:15:08.883 --> 01:15:12.125]  Could have got the teenager next door to cut the grass for probably $25.
[01:15:12.785 --> 01:15:19.130]  But anyway, so she's waiting, and she's just sitting there, John, I can't believe this.
[01:15:19.190 --> 01:15:20.631]  How could this be?
[01:15:21.111 --> 01:15:22.992]  This can't be justice in America.
[01:15:23.032 --> 01:15:25.674]  And she's just sitting there, John, thinking out loud.
[01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:30.082]  The cop comes up behind her and puts his foot on top of her foot.
[01:15:30.643 --> 01:15:31.743]  She can't see who it is.
[01:15:31.783 --> 01:15:33.184]  He never identifies himself.
[01:15:33.264 --> 01:15:35.346]  So she says, what the hay is going on?
[01:15:35.406 --> 01:15:37.047]  Who are you and identify yourself?
[01:15:37.527 --> 01:15:45.552]  And he says, I'll ask the questions and hits her in the back of the head, which dislodges to an uncomfortable position.
[01:15:46.032 --> 01:15:48.754]  Her right prosthesis, it doesn't come out.
[01:15:49.274 --> 01:15:51.496]  It's just dislodged to an uncomfortable position.
[01:15:52.076 --> 01:15:55.318]  So she starts trying to get it back to a comfortable position.
[01:15:55.896 --> 01:15:57.976]  And the man says, oh, you're trying to bite me.
[01:15:58.957 --> 01:16:05.118]  And this is a guy by the name of Officer Miller, who's about 6'2", 255 pounds.
[01:16:05.218 --> 01:16:06.238]  He's a real man!
[01:16:06.758 --> 01:16:23.282]  And he, and him and his partner, Officer Sajak, immediately take this woman to the ground, grab her by her hair, pull out their canister of pepper spray, mace her in both eyes, in which the prosthesis comes out.
[01:16:24.983 --> 01:16:30.705]  And then they beat her down, and she's on the ground with both hands underneath her.
[01:16:31.745 --> 01:16:35.506]  At this point, her 95-year-old mother comes out and says, What are you doing?
[01:16:37.326 --> 01:16:38.547]  My daughter is blind.
[01:16:39.087 --> 01:16:41.287]  She's got a bad back, and she's hard of hearing.
[01:16:41.707 --> 01:16:44.448]  You wouldn't do a dog the way you're doing my daughter.
[01:16:44.608 --> 01:16:49.009]  And the mace is burning her, so Miss Crowder screams, I need water.
[01:16:49.749 --> 01:16:51.810]  So the 95-year-old mother goes in.
[01:16:52.748 --> 01:16:55.769]  Get some water to help wash out her baby's eyes.
[01:16:56.729 --> 01:17:00.851]  By the way, the newspaper reports that there's witnesses by now watching all of this.
[01:17:01.191 --> 01:17:01.511]  Yes.
[01:17:02.711 --> 01:17:11.534]  And then Officer Sajak gets up off of her and Officer Miller stays on her and goes in behind the 94-year-old mother, Tommy Scott.
[01:17:12.334 --> 01:17:13.615]  And she says, get out of here.
[01:17:13.635 --> 01:17:14.495]  I don't want you in here.
[01:17:14.995 --> 01:17:17.136]  And he says, you better believe I'm going to stay in here.
[01:17:17.476 --> 01:17:18.576]  You're going for a gun.
[01:17:19.256 --> 01:17:21.017]  She goes to her kitchen, gets a
[01:17:21.710 --> 01:17:28.593]  Two-quart plastic Tupperware bowl, fills it with water, turns back around, heads back out for her daughter.
[01:17:28.973 --> 01:17:31.554]  Mindful, she's 94 years old, she can't run.
[01:17:31.574 --> 01:17:34.915]  This is an obvious Al-Qaeda move, getting water for her daughter.
[01:17:36.016 --> 01:17:41.078]  And then, as she approaches her daughter, Sajak doesn't say anything to Miller.
[01:17:41.118 --> 01:17:42.178]  Miller gets up off of
[01:17:42.702 --> 01:17:56.953]  Eunice Crowder for a moment and slams the 94 year old mother with the water up against the fence knocking the water out of her hand and in his report saying that she was trying to assault me with the water.
[01:17:58.524 --> 01:18:06.706]  Okay, but you, okay, so then Eunice is still down on the ground with her, with her arms underneath her body wondering what is, you know, what is going on.
[01:18:06.726 --> 01:18:10.407]  Well, I made the Al Qaeda comment because we're all terrorists now.
[01:18:10.747 --> 01:18:12.107]  We're all evil terrorists.
[01:18:12.127 --> 01:18:13.007]  That's how they treat us.
[01:18:13.487 --> 01:18:14.607]  Oh, I can believe that.
[01:18:14.627 --> 01:18:20.889]  And so, so, so, they're saying she's, you know, they're yelling to her to quit resisting.
[01:18:21.729 --> 01:18:26.410]  And so she has her hands underneath her body with her back exposed on the ground.
[01:18:26.994 --> 01:18:29.296]  Sajak pulls out his taser.
[01:18:30.057 --> 01:18:33.580]  And you know now that these tasers shoot like guns.
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:34.981]  They shoot electrodes.
[01:18:35.482 --> 01:18:38.344]  They're not the kind that you go up and stick into a person.
[01:18:39.445 --> 01:18:42.268]  These are the kinds that shoot electrodes out like guns.
[01:18:43.088 --> 01:18:49.274]  And Officer Sajak shoots her four times in her back with a taser.
[01:18:50.126 --> 01:18:52.748]  And once in her right breast with a taser.
[01:18:52.948 --> 01:18:57.232]  So, I mean, it's not enough to just hit her once with something that'll knock down a horse.
[01:18:57.592 --> 01:18:59.874]  We've got to taser her over and over again.
[01:19:00.135 --> 01:19:07.421]  Yeah, they taser her, in my mind, to their satisfaction until she's totally broke and almost dead.
[01:19:08.222 --> 01:19:14.527]  Then they pull her limp arms around her body and handcuff her and then yell at her to get up
[01:19:15.202 --> 01:19:18.205]  And she says, I bet you wouldn't yell at your mom like that.
[01:19:18.405 --> 01:19:21.007]  And Miller yells back, my mom is 74.
[01:19:21.107 --> 01:19:22.628]  She says, well, I'm 71.
[01:19:23.689 --> 01:19:36.760]  And then they put her in the police car, take her down and charge her with the crimes of harassment, which is, which in Oregon is, is attempted assault of a police officer and disobeying a police order.
[01:19:38.366 --> 01:19:42.551]  Well, what happened was we had to go to trial on these charges.
[01:19:42.651 --> 01:19:43.852]  I tell you what, stay there, sir.
[01:19:43.892 --> 01:19:45.494]  I really appreciate your time.
[01:19:45.534 --> 01:19:47.916]  An amazing gentleman standing up for this lady.
[01:19:48.557 --> 01:19:50.158]  Ernest Warren, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:19:50.178 --> 01:19:51.600]  We'll come back and tell you what happened next.

[01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:55.601]  Jack Brownring for Midas Resources.
[01:21:56.101 --> 01:21:59.522]  Last summer we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[01:22:00.022 --> 01:22:00.682]  Let's update.
[01:22:01.202 --> 01:22:04.663]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[01:22:05.323 --> 01:22:09.044]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[01:22:09.725 --> 01:22:13.025]  Two years ago the US dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[01:22:13.546 --> 01:22:16.686]  Today the US dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[01:22:17.107 --> 01:22:18.627]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[01:22:19.207 --> 01:22:21.168]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283.
[01:22:22.526 --> 01:22:27.390]  January of 04, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:30.552]  Gold is moving, equities are treading water.
[01:22:30.952 --> 01:22:33.594]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[01:22:34.154 --> 01:22:35.535]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[01:22:35.956 --> 01:22:37.697]  Physical possession, private gold.
[01:22:38.097 --> 01:22:40.059]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[01:22:40.479 --> 01:22:42.581]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[01:22:44.762 --> 01:22:46.884]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.
[01:22:47.284 --> 01:22:47.584]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:52.108 --> 01:22:53.650]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:22:53.810 --> 01:22:54.932]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:22:55.132 --> 01:22:58.537]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:22:58.637 --> 01:22:59.077]  Phenol!
[01:22:59.398 --> 01:23:06.467]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:23:07.008 --> 01:23:10.890]  The FDA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:23:11.010 --> 01:23:11.450]  Fragrance?
[01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:16.592]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:23:16.732 --> 01:23:21.394]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[01:23:21.634 --> 01:23:24.175]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my CalBen shampoo.
[01:23:24.455 --> 01:23:27.856]  Well, like all of the products from the CalBen Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:23:28.016 --> 01:23:31.598]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[01:23:31.758 --> 01:23:32.398]  No harsh chemicals.
[01:23:32.458 --> 01:23:33.418]  We're good to go!
[01:24:03.118 --> 01:24:20.226]  We're talking to Ernest Warren, and he's one of the local counsels on cases for Jerry Spence, just a great lawyer who stands up for very diverse crowds, you know, from black people having their rights violated to Mr. Weaver.
[01:24:21.733 --> 01:24:31.783]  And I was just talking to Mr. Warren during the break, and he talked about how law enforcement is a growth industry, how they're very arrogant in Portland because they have a strong police union.
[01:24:32.664 --> 01:24:33.825]  They're not held accountable.
[01:24:34.005 --> 01:24:39.470]  And I'm seeing an acceleration of the arrogance, the hatred of the population.
[01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:41.412]  They've militarized the police.
[01:24:41.512 --> 01:24:43.354]  It's now an us-against-them mentality.
[01:24:44.375 --> 01:24:46.176]  And this is a major sign of tyranny.
[01:24:47.098 --> 01:24:50.406]  So now they beat this old woman up, this blind old woman up.
[01:24:50.827 --> 01:24:52.431]  Taser her five times.
[01:24:53.393 --> 01:24:54.396]  Not four, I'm sorry.
[01:24:54.416 --> 01:24:55.177]  The number was worse.
[01:24:56.432 --> 01:25:00.313]  And then they go ahead and charge her with attempted assault and some other stuff.
[01:25:00.593 --> 01:25:02.174]  So now it's going to trial.
[01:25:02.754 --> 01:25:04.595]  How did you handle this, Mr. Warren?
[01:25:04.975 --> 01:25:19.599]  Well, of course we filed a civil complaint under 42 United States Code 1983 in Federal District Court in Oregon for excessive force as the criminal case was proceeding along.
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:22.260]  And we just go to trial.
[01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:24.661]  We make our opening statement, not
[01:25:25.513 --> 01:25:26.113]  A little bit.
[01:25:26.753 --> 01:25:28.294]  We gave you a nutshell of that.
[01:25:30.755 --> 01:25:32.535]  They were pretty overwhelmed by that.
[01:25:32.715 --> 01:25:37.017]  We cross-examined them and got them to admit they never identified themselves.
[01:25:38.277 --> 01:25:40.057]  They only had one thing in mind.
[01:25:40.077 --> 01:25:43.659]  That was taking Eunice Crowder down as if she was a criminal.
[01:25:45.099 --> 01:25:53.521]  And it was clear under the law that she had not violated, she had not attempted to assault them or harass them or annoy them.
[01:25:55.655 --> 01:25:58.300]  And that she hadn't disobeyed any police order.
[01:25:59.362 --> 01:25:59.582]  So...
[01:26:00.815 --> 01:26:05.617]  Well, what's wrong with these bureaucrats that she says, I'm blind, Sonny, will you please read it to me?
[01:26:05.897 --> 01:26:08.038]  He wads it up and throws it at her, basically.
[01:26:08.599 --> 01:26:10.580]  Then she says, look, don't take my wagon.
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:11.420]  I'm going to call the police.
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:12.901]  He goes, no, don't worry, I will.
[01:26:14.321 --> 01:26:15.662]  She was calling the police on him.
[01:26:15.682 --> 01:26:17.563]  He calls the police on her.
[01:26:17.583 --> 01:26:24.826]  They come, step on her hand, hit her in the back of the head, assault the 95-year-old woman, then attack her with tasers.
[01:26:25.466 --> 01:26:26.227]  Please continue.
[01:26:26.627 --> 01:26:27.867]  And Macer.
[01:26:28.268 --> 01:26:28.748]  Oh, yes, sir.
[01:26:29.148 --> 01:26:32.131]  And Maester in both eyes and the prosthesis comes out.
[01:26:32.611 --> 01:26:44.201]  Well, I mean, they totally had any disregard for her and they totally humiliated her and that's the place where they want to go in every encounter with a citizen.
[01:26:44.281 --> 01:26:52.328]  I mean, you know, it wasn't like the old days when you had, I mean, you could really look to a cop and see that this was a man of genuine respect.
[01:26:52.728 --> 01:26:56.712]  I mean, you look at him now and you want to keep your hands out in front of him so you don't get shot.
[01:26:57.780 --> 01:27:01.443]  Here's a quote out of a news article by Steve Dunn of the Oregonian.
[01:27:01.983 --> 01:27:04.065]  Eustace Crowder, you see, didn't follow orders.
[01:27:04.685 --> 01:27:10.749]  Eunice was uncooperative, worried a city employee was hauling away a family heirloom, a 90-year-old red toy wagon.
[01:27:11.450 --> 01:27:18.294]  She had the nerve to field her way towards the trailer in which her yard debris was being tossed.
[01:27:21.116 --> 01:27:22.838]  You know, this is such an illustration.
[01:27:22.898 --> 01:27:24.839]  It's not one horror story.
[01:27:24.879 --> 01:27:26.000]  It's not isolated.
[01:27:26.647 --> 01:27:39.672]  I mean, we have cases where they raid whole neighborhoods looking for drugs, find no drugs, shovel ladies down into fire ant beds, laugh at them, you know, go in people's houses, pull out their Playboys, laugh at them.
[01:27:40.352 --> 01:27:42.133]  You know, it's just getting crazier.
[01:27:43.033 --> 01:27:46.274]  These are sadistic gang members with guns and badges!
[01:27:47.175 --> 01:27:47.435]  Yes.
[01:27:48.635 --> 01:27:49.816]  So what happened in the trial?
[01:27:50.416 --> 01:27:55.258]  Well, what happened in the trial is, of course, in the criminal trial,
[01:27:56.198 --> 01:28:07.925]  The judge, after the close of the state's evidence, and after me showing him, demonstrating for him, that Eunice Crowder is totally blind, dismissed the case.
[01:28:08.546 --> 01:28:13.189]  He just couldn't believe it, he thought it was an injustice, and dismissed the case.
[01:28:13.929 --> 01:28:22.415]  And then that happened on a Monday, and then on the Friday, Eunice Crowder agreed to accept a settlement of $145,000.
[01:28:24.989 --> 01:28:27.351]  But the police are saying we didn't do anything wrong.
[01:28:27.692 --> 01:28:32.857]  Yeah, sometimes they can't see the error of their ways.
[01:28:32.957 --> 01:28:34.698]  I mean, that's the arrogance.
[01:28:34.759 --> 01:28:43.367]  I mean, the city council said, well, I hope as we pay this settlement that they take this as a training
[01:28:44.102 --> 01:28:48.003]  Uh, event that you shouldn't go around beating up on elderly people.
[01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:56.286]  Now, from this, though, I mean, the people are finally starting to wake up as they gun down unarmed men and women, pregnant women.
[01:28:57.327 --> 01:29:02.368]  Uh, are the police showing any response to this, or just more arrogance?
[01:29:02.849 --> 01:29:07.610]  Well, you know, it's more arrogance, and they're more worried about their morale.
[01:29:07.670 --> 01:29:12.752]  I mean, when they had to pay out this sum of money and they have to be subject to public ridicule,
[01:29:13.177 --> 01:29:18.899]  They're worried about their morale, more than they are the safety, the welfare of the community.
[01:29:18.979 --> 01:29:20.980]  Are they saying the word morale?
[01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:21.660]  Yeah.
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:29.123]  I love all these military terms where they call government people officials and we're civilians and they're a military force.
[01:29:29.203 --> 01:29:30.403]  What is a military fight?
[01:29:30.803 --> 01:29:31.904]  They fight an enemy.
[01:29:32.204 --> 01:29:35.325]  So we have militarized police and they treat us like the enemy.
[01:29:35.665 --> 01:29:37.366]  Like we're in Fallujah or something.
[01:29:38.826 --> 01:29:39.506]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:39.526 --> 01:29:40.327]  Please stay with us, sir.
[01:29:40.367 --> 01:29:41.527]  We'll take your calls when we get back.
[01:29:44.088 --> 01:29:47.072]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:48.014 --> 01:29:50.698]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:54.182 --> 01:29:58.066]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:29:58.306 --> 01:30:03.731]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:30:04.011 --> 01:30:14.381]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:30:14.561 --> 01:30:18.885]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:30:19.065 --> 01:30:19.886]  We're good to go!
[01:30:34.256 --> 01:30:38.077]  All across America, people are using the sun and wind to create enough energy to power their homes.
[01:30:59.730 --> 01:31:04.473]  For over 18 years, these people have trusted Sunelco to help them on the road to energy independence.
[01:31:05.173 --> 01:31:07.835]  Sunelco has systems to meet every need and budget.

[01:31:13.299 --> 01:31:17.861]  With the rise in the cost of electricity, it makes sense to add renewable energy to your home or business.
[01:31:18.382 --> 01:31:22.825]  Many states offer cash rebates and tax breaks to those with renewable energy systems.
[01:31:23.285 --> 01:31:23.725]  It's easy!
[01:31:24.165 --> 01:31:28.148]  Many of Sunelco's systems come packaged for easy installation by the homeowner.

[01:31:55.264 --> 01:31:56.245]  Spring has arrived!
[01:31:56.425 --> 01:31:59.389]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:31:59.609 --> 01:32:03.073]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:32:03.294 --> 01:32:11.404]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[01:32:11.684 --> 01:32:15.425]  With ARC's Heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.

[01:32:45.532 --> 01:32:46.133]  My friends,
[01:33:04.898 --> 01:33:10.183]  I think we all know police are very corrupt in Mexico.
[01:33:12.705 --> 01:33:13.986]  For hundreds of years.
[01:33:14.246 --> 01:33:16.288]  Going back to the conquistadors for that matter.
[01:33:16.428 --> 01:33:19.330]  Imperial rule, abuse of the population.
[01:33:20.751 --> 01:33:26.876]  And in Mexico 50 years ago, they had special police units called Foxes.
[01:33:27.877 --> 01:33:31.020]  And they wore black uniforms, black boots, black ski masks.
[01:33:33.406 --> 01:33:42.996]  The Nazis employed this during World War II in Poland and other countries when they would go around door-to-door grabbing people at night, they would wear a black mask with their helmets over it.
[01:33:43.897 --> 01:33:52.166]  So today when the SWAT teams wear the black mask, that's part of being the enforcers, the inquisitors, the secret police.
[01:33:53.848 --> 01:33:55.770]  And we have that going on here in America.
[01:33:56.314 --> 01:34:09.362]  Well, the executioners of old do this, and they cover their identities, they cover their badges, at least here in Austin and many other areas of the country, and they treat us like we're a foreign enemy or they're an occupying power.
[01:34:09.783 --> 01:34:20.189]  And we're talking to Ernest Warren, the lawyer for this little old lady, Eunice Crowder, and her and her 95-year-old mama got beat up pretty bad and then charged.
[01:34:21.130 --> 01:34:23.131]  The judge, thank God, threw the case out.
[01:34:24.296 --> 01:34:33.185]  But the police are still strutting around talking about how poor they are, and how they're under attack, and boy, they sure get treated bad.
[01:34:33.205 --> 01:34:34.867]  I mean, look, people!
[01:34:35.127 --> 01:34:37.589]  You're not, you know, better than a little old lady!
[01:34:38.450 --> 01:34:45.838]  And before we go to these calls, I would ask the callers, I know some of you were holding before our guest was on, try to address this subject and you can bring up whatever you want.
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:53.061]  Before we do that, you talked about the phenomenon in your city of them bringing in police from other communities.
[01:34:53.842 --> 01:34:55.042]  Please expand on that.
[01:34:55.622 --> 01:35:14.726]  Well, I mean, I just never really understood why they would go all around the country to bring in people that basically are robots, rather than going to... Every time they put out for recruiters, a whole bunch of people from the community
[01:35:15.427 --> 01:35:16.408]  Go to apply.
[01:35:16.468 --> 01:35:23.134]  I mean, people that grew up in this neighborhood, people that know the neighborhood, and 99% of them never get chosen.
[01:35:23.974 --> 01:35:25.275]  And it's the craziest thing.
[01:35:25.456 --> 01:35:26.416]  Well, let's be honest.
[01:35:26.937 --> 01:35:30.380]  Most of those being hired just got back from Iraq.
[01:35:31.275 --> 01:35:33.177]  And they've been shoving old ladies around.
[01:35:33.217 --> 01:35:34.518]  They've been beating people up.
[01:35:35.318 --> 01:35:38.701]  They've been pulling their guns at checkpoints and knowing people down.
[01:35:38.721 --> 01:35:50.091]  In a lot of these cases, I'm not against the troops, folks, but you don't take them from gun confiscation and checkpoint detail, again, in Fallujah or Baghdad, and then put them on our streets.
[01:35:51.212 --> 01:35:55.275]  Well, I bet you that's probably what's going on, but it certainly doesn't make sense to me.
[01:35:56.096 --> 01:36:00.019]  I mean, I'm certain that if a community cop had known
[01:36:00.746 --> 01:36:05.688]  Elderly 71-year-old Eunice Crowder, he would have said, ma'am, now what's going on?
[01:36:06.468 --> 01:36:10.369]  Instead of, I'll ask the questions and knocking her upside the head.
[01:36:10.509 --> 01:36:12.029]  Well, I mean, they're so insecure.
[01:36:12.069 --> 01:36:13.790]  I go back to this gang member analogy.
[01:36:14.090 --> 01:36:17.511]  Their own gang member handbooks, gang psychology handbooks, would explain it.
[01:36:18.171 --> 01:36:23.813]  I mean, you know, you know, with the gang member to not pop off at them because they don't want to be dissed.
[01:36:24.493 --> 01:36:25.814]  They're going to bust a cap in you.
[01:36:26.174 --> 01:36:26.654]  Well, now,
[01:36:27.839 --> 01:36:31.622]  That's now exactly how the police act, but even worse, more dangerous.
[01:36:32.343 --> 01:36:38.388]  And if you, in the slightest way, don't lick their boots, they'll beat the daylights out of you, kill you, and then frame you.
[01:36:38.848 --> 01:36:40.249]  And we see this nationwide.
[01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:42.011]  I mean, they'll come at you with a toilet plunger.
[01:36:42.672 --> 01:36:43.252]  Exactly.
[01:36:45.013 --> 01:36:49.978]  So I'm... I mean, look, before it was just, you know, the disadvantage they would target.
[01:36:49.998 --> 01:36:54.982]  Now it's old ladies, it's everybody, and it's wrong regardless of who they do it to, but
[01:36:55.663 --> 01:36:58.406]  I'm trying to get my mind around this mindset.
[01:36:58.446 --> 01:36:58.787]  Go ahead.
[01:36:59.047 --> 01:37:02.511]  There's an excellent analogy that Jerry Spence told me.
[01:37:03.031 --> 01:37:07.676]  He says the wolf looks at the flock of sheep and he doesn't run after the strongest one first.
[01:37:08.177 --> 01:37:09.718]  He runs after the weakest one.
[01:37:10.259 --> 01:37:14.343]  But then after the weakest are all gone, then everybody's open for prey.
[01:37:14.564 --> 01:37:16.526]  Well that's what Tony Brown says.
[01:37:18.192 --> 01:37:21.775]  Uh, is, uh, that, uh, you know, that's exactly what they do.
[01:37:22.295 --> 01:37:23.796]  They target the disadvantaged first.
[01:37:23.856 --> 01:37:25.697]  After they're done feeding on them, they move out.
[01:37:26.077 --> 01:37:28.359]  Plus, they get conditioned that it's their right to do it.
[01:37:28.999 --> 01:37:29.540]  Exactly.
[01:37:31.201 --> 01:37:35.464]  Well, I mean, so they won't apologize even after the settlement?
[01:37:35.484 --> 01:37:37.705]  They won't even say, yeah, it's wrong to beat up old ladies?
[01:37:38.386 --> 01:37:38.506]  No.
[01:37:39.907 --> 01:37:40.087]  Nope.
[01:37:40.647 --> 01:37:46.869]  Whatever happened to being respectful to old ladies even if they are cranky as their possessions are being stolen?
[01:37:47.329 --> 01:37:59.092]  You know, I don't understand it because I grew up in Portland and I was a boy scout and we were taught to help old ladies across the street and you know and so forth and help elderly people and I did.
[01:37:59.112 --> 01:38:01.312]  And I just don't get it.
[01:38:03.953 --> 01:38:07.954]  Well I'll tell you that is a predatory like stance to attack the weak.
[01:38:10.094 --> 01:38:11.195]  That is very scary.
[01:38:11.555 --> 01:38:13.277]  Let's take a few calls here.
[01:38:14.217 --> 01:38:16.739]  I guess up next is Neil in Canada.
[01:38:16.819 --> 01:38:17.740]  Neil, you're on the air.
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:18.281]  Go ahead.
[01:38:18.821 --> 01:38:19.421]  Good day, sir.
[01:38:20.102 --> 01:38:20.262]  Welcome.
[01:38:20.282 --> 01:38:20.723]  Thank you, Mr. Warren.
[01:38:21.583 --> 01:38:21.863]  Hello.
[01:38:22.484 --> 01:38:25.706]  I just wanted to thank you for definitely standing up for these ladies.
[01:38:25.787 --> 01:38:27.488]  I mean, that's crazy.
[01:38:27.548 --> 01:38:32.792]  I've been a victim of police brutality myself, but if there's anything more wrong than wrong, it's tasering a 70- or 90-year-old woman.
[01:38:35.463 --> 01:38:36.283]  That's definitely crazy.
[01:38:36.703 --> 01:38:37.564]  Five times!
[01:38:37.904 --> 01:38:42.365]  Did the police, Mr. Warren, ever explain why they tasered her five times?
[01:38:43.045 --> 01:38:43.285]  No.
[01:38:43.905 --> 01:38:44.546]  No, they didn't.
[01:38:44.746 --> 01:38:48.067]  I mean, you know, they never explained that.
[01:38:48.227 --> 01:38:57.169]  Before I could get to that point in the cross-examination in the criminal case, the judge cut me off and said, Mr. Warren, I'm not going to give you a free deposition.
[01:38:57.879 --> 01:39:06.605]  By the way, tasers and other non-lethal weapons are not non-lethal in many cases, and they're called less lethal by the industry.
[01:39:07.045 --> 01:39:13.569]  These are actually training aids to get them used to using unreasonable force immediately, and then they're being protected.
[01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:23.276]  Well, the peppermace is pretty bad for an elderly old woman, too, because when it got into her nasal passages and down into her lungs, it ultimately scarred her lungs.
[01:39:25.726 --> 01:39:27.007]  Well, I say they got off easy.
[01:39:27.047 --> 01:39:27.868]  Anything else, Neil?
[01:39:28.448 --> 01:39:33.512]  Yeah, I just wanted to give you a heads up on the new police state legislation that was unveiled on us this morning.
[01:39:33.552 --> 01:39:35.974]  They call it the National Security Policy.
[01:39:36.935 --> 01:39:45.662]  And they're saying that the legislation's anchored to the Charter of Rights, which gives us the right to life, liberty, and the security of the person.
[01:39:46.042 --> 01:39:55.230]  But then they're spinning it around and they're saying that the terrorists are the threat to our security of the person, so now they have to take our liberty away to keep us secure, because that's our right.
[01:39:56.022 --> 01:39:57.323]  Exactly what Hitler said.
[01:39:57.363 --> 01:39:58.483]  You have a right to be safe.
[01:39:58.523 --> 01:39:59.284]  I'm taking your freedoms.
[01:39:59.304 --> 01:39:59.944]  Thanks for the call.
[01:39:59.964 --> 01:40:02.105]  Sean, where are you calling us from?
[01:40:02.125 --> 01:40:03.406]  Hello?
[01:40:03.726 --> 01:40:03.906]  Yes, sir.
[01:40:03.926 --> 01:40:04.746]  Where are you calling from?
[01:40:05.106 --> 01:40:06.787]  I'm calling from Salata, Colorado.
[01:40:07.007 --> 01:40:07.307]  Welcome.
[01:40:07.327 --> 01:40:07.828]  You're on the air.
[01:40:07.888 --> 01:40:08.288]  Go ahead.
[01:40:09.228 --> 01:40:11.129]  Alex, I wanted to thank you for your stand.
[01:40:12.450 --> 01:40:13.550]  I'm up in the high country.
[01:40:14.111 --> 01:40:16.612]  I'm a local DJ on a community radio station.
[01:40:16.732 --> 01:40:18.132]  I am reiterating your message.
[01:40:18.332 --> 01:40:19.533]  One hour a week is all I get.
[01:40:20.514 --> 01:40:21.974]  Me and my friends, we have some of your tapes.
[01:40:22.254 --> 01:40:23.675]  We are copying them and distributing them.
[01:40:24.028 --> 01:40:24.348]  Good.
[01:40:24.729 --> 01:40:26.530]  And, uh, this stuff is outrageous.
[01:40:27.410 --> 01:40:34.235]  And, uh, these police, in my opinion, should be hung along with Janet Reno and Amy Gorlick on the White House lawn.
[01:40:35.015 --> 01:40:37.977]  Well, I don't agree with any violence towards them, and that's what the establishment wants.
[01:40:38.137 --> 01:40:39.118]  I mean legally.
[01:40:39.558 --> 01:40:40.599]  They should be tried.
[01:40:41.099 --> 01:40:43.361]  They should be found guilty, and they should be hung.
[01:40:44.136 --> 01:40:45.677]  I think that's an important point.
[01:40:46.417 --> 01:40:54.362]  You know, here we don't have an independent body, legislative or prosecutorial body, to look at what the police do.
[01:40:54.882 --> 01:41:05.127]  You know, they're working hand in hand with county district attorneys who just rubber stamp any of their deadly conduct.
[01:41:05.748 --> 01:41:10.130]  I think there needs to be an outside agency that isn't bought off by politicians.
[01:41:10.703 --> 01:41:14.405]  That can prosecute these people for beating up on 71-year-old women.
[01:41:14.666 --> 01:41:19.909]  Well, if the grand juries weren't rubber stamps to the prosecutors, we'd have that with jury nullification, wouldn't we?
[01:41:20.429 --> 01:41:26.974]  Well, probably so, but, you know, what happens is the prosecutor gets in front of his chosen grand jury.
[01:41:27.854 --> 01:41:35.079]  The other side of the equation doesn't get to advocate for their position to the grand jury, so they only hear one
[01:41:35.934 --> 01:41:41.278]  side of it and that doesn't get recorded and it's a secret so we don't know what they're telling the grand jury.
[01:41:41.899 --> 01:41:42.979]  Good point, Sean.
[01:41:42.999 --> 01:41:43.760]  Thanks for the call.
[01:41:45.381 --> 01:41:46.442]  Who's up next, Stephanie?
[01:41:47.423 --> 01:41:48.443]  Calvin in New York.
[01:41:48.504 --> 01:41:49.264]  Go ahead, Calvin.
[01:41:50.265 --> 01:41:50.785]  Hello, Alex.
[01:41:51.166 --> 01:41:51.446]  Yes.
[01:41:52.086 --> 01:41:53.027]  How are you today?
[01:41:53.207 --> 01:41:53.928]  Good.
[01:41:54.648 --> 01:41:55.749]  A really sad story.
[01:41:55.769 --> 01:41:56.650]  It can make me cry.
[01:41:56.670 --> 01:41:59.011]  I was assaulted by the police.
[01:41:59.151 --> 01:42:00.593]  That's not what I want to get into.
[01:42:00.613 --> 01:42:05.036]  I just wanted to say that because, you know, it's not uncommon
[01:42:05.506 --> 01:42:12.007]  For law-abiding citizens like myself to end up, you know, being abused by the police.
[01:42:12.067 --> 01:42:28.691]  But my point would be that the police are out of control in this country because, well, the drug war is one of the things that have led to all of this.
[01:42:29.554 --> 01:42:31.555]  Because it opened it up.
[01:42:31.655 --> 01:42:32.955]  It's called a war.
[01:42:33.055 --> 01:42:35.416]  The government ships it in, then creates the crisis.
[01:42:35.436 --> 01:42:38.377]  The bigger the drug war, the more drugs, the more people in prison.
[01:42:38.617 --> 01:42:41.198]  The drug war is a great success for the police state.
[01:42:41.478 --> 01:42:46.159]  Not the success we think of it, but a success of having more drugs, having more people in prison.
[01:42:46.359 --> 01:42:48.440]  Let's get a comment from Mr. Warren on that.
[01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:52.402]  Well, I think that we really lost the drug war.
[01:42:52.522 --> 01:43:00.826]  If we look at the statistics, they basically just scratched the surface of prosecuting people that traffic in drugs.
[01:43:01.266 --> 01:43:06.348]  And we have more drugs in this country making more illegal money than ever before.
[01:43:06.488 --> 01:43:08.409]  But see, you look at that as a good person.
[01:43:08.749 --> 01:43:09.469]  Oh, it's failed.
[01:43:09.509 --> 01:43:15.772]  But for them, more private prisons, more police, big industry, more drugs for the big banks to launder.
[01:43:16.052 --> 01:43:16.653]  They love it.
[01:43:17.887 --> 01:43:19.689]  And it just doesn't make any sense.
[01:43:19.709 --> 01:43:27.836]  In long prison terms, you know, and prison terms for, you know, just minuscule amounts of drugs.
[01:43:27.896 --> 01:43:32.500]  Did you hear about Dallas where they just randomly pull a car over and throw a bag of chalk in the back?
[01:43:33.021 --> 01:43:33.441]  Oh, Lord.
[01:43:33.561 --> 01:43:38.066]  And then the drug lab certifies it as cocaine and they go to a prison and they take their house?
[01:43:39.147 --> 01:43:39.707]  Oh, Lord.
[01:43:40.608 --> 01:43:43.651]  That's horrible, but yeah, that happens all over the country.
[01:43:44.868 --> 01:43:54.994]  You know, and it's the case where a person like this gentleman from New York gets beat up by the police wrongfully, somehow he should seek out a lawyer and try to challenge them.
[01:43:55.254 --> 01:44:01.817]  Because you're not going to get the politicians to make a change, the only change is going to be made through their pocketbook.
[01:44:01.917 --> 01:44:04.459]  That's why they want to give themselves liability protection.
[01:44:04.499 --> 01:44:08.001]  They want to turn their lawyers loose, but keep us from getting good lawyers.
[01:44:08.321 --> 01:44:09.081]  Thanks for the call.
[01:44:10.402 --> 01:44:12.303]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Ohio.
[01:44:12.363 --> 01:44:14.004]  Tim, go ahead, you're on the air with our guest.
[01:44:14.504 --> 01:44:15.805]  Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[01:44:16.085 --> 01:44:16.325]  Yes.
[01:44:16.665 --> 01:44:17.625]  Good afternoon, Mr. Warren.
[01:44:18.026 --> 01:44:18.666]  Good afternoon.
[01:44:18.846 --> 01:44:25.188]  My question is, after all of this, nothing, am I understanding that correctly, nothing is going to happen to these two officers?
[01:44:25.589 --> 01:44:25.969]  Nothing.
[01:44:26.009 --> 01:44:27.469]  They haven't been disciplined.
[01:44:29.210 --> 01:44:36.653]  I mean, the county, Multnomah County District Attorney's Office would never prosecute them for a deadly assault.
[01:44:37.173 --> 01:44:38.814]  I mean, this woman could have died from this.
[01:44:38.854 --> 01:44:43.676]  Listen, I have a friend, no criminal record, manages an entire Home Depot,
[01:44:44.682 --> 01:44:49.485]  Paralyzed from the chest down, driving his car.
[01:44:50.106 --> 01:44:54.288]  The cop pulls him over for throwing a cigarette out the window on a rainy day.
[01:44:54.729 --> 01:44:59.832]  He asks him, he says, and this is on the record, and this is a high level cop, this is a supervisor.
[01:45:00.192 --> 01:45:02.474]  He says, what is all this bleep?
[01:45:02.514 --> 01:45:04.555]  Sir, I'm paralyzed, these are hand controls.
[01:45:05.194 --> 01:45:06.174]  He says, get out of the car.
[01:45:06.214 --> 01:45:08.916]  He says, sir, I have to access the lift.
[01:45:08.996 --> 01:45:09.536]  I have to get out.
[01:45:09.576 --> 01:45:10.216]  He says, get out.
[01:45:10.256 --> 01:45:10.876]  He said, OK.
[01:45:11.196 --> 01:45:12.077]  He said, get out now.
[01:45:12.177 --> 01:45:16.759]  Grabs him by the hair, drags him out, beats him up, and then says, now you can go.
[01:45:16.819 --> 01:45:25.542]  And the guy bleeding in front of his wife, who, by the way, works at a jail, has to crawl to the wheelchair that his wife has gotten out.
[01:45:27.123 --> 01:45:27.863]  That's just sickening.
[01:45:28.283 --> 01:45:30.104]  Is there any way we can get that?
[01:45:30.604 --> 01:45:31.965]  I would love to get that case.
[01:45:33.007 --> 01:45:35.848]  I mean, that's just unbelievable.
[01:45:36.629 --> 01:45:38.850]  Is there any way we can get court watchers on these folks?
[01:45:41.031 --> 01:45:43.172]  Oh, in fact, I'm going to be getting court watchers on.
[01:45:43.312 --> 01:45:46.093]  I'm sure there's a lot of good organizations out there that need to expose us.
[01:45:46.133 --> 01:45:49.134]  The problem is there's so many abuses, it's like fish in the sea.
[01:45:49.775 --> 01:45:51.115]  Thanks for the call, Tim.
[01:45:51.596 --> 01:45:54.197]  We've only got time for maybe one or two calls left for our guest.
[01:45:54.237 --> 01:45:54.857]  He's got to go.
[01:45:54.877 --> 01:45:57.038]  He's got cases to deal with.
[01:45:57.118 --> 01:46:00.960]  But look, there's so many of these cases that I...
[01:46:02.077 --> 01:46:05.679]  I mean, we're not here just picking a few, are we, Mr. Warren?
[01:46:05.819 --> 01:46:07.260]  No, not at all.
[01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:09.362]  I mean, it happens all over the country.
[01:46:10.622 --> 01:46:12.744]  But they certainly need to be challenged.
[01:46:12.864 --> 01:46:14.765]  And, like, you made a great point, Alex.
[01:46:15.486 --> 01:46:21.149]  Basically, they have way ten times, a hundred times more money than the average attorney does.
[01:46:22.010 --> 01:46:28.674]  And they'll use all their resources to try to quiet and sequester these cases.
[01:46:30.214 --> 01:46:55.044]  Well, I tell you, in most cases I see now, we're just a normal, and again I say just a normal white person, because if you're a minority, you're in even more trouble, and you know, just short hair, you know, groveling to them, but if you do one thing, one thing that they think is disrespectful, a lot of them will just beat you down, and that shows just, that is just insane avarice.
[01:46:55.885 --> 01:46:56.105]  Yes.
[01:46:58.208 --> 01:46:59.849]  I don't even know what to say to this anymore.
[01:46:59.929 --> 01:47:03.051]  I mean, let's talk to Bob in Colorado.
[01:47:03.071 --> 01:47:06.474]  We're going to let our guest go, and I'll go to Rodney and Woody and others.
[01:47:06.854 --> 01:47:07.694]  Bob, go ahead.
[01:47:07.935 --> 01:47:08.915]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:47:10.256 --> 01:47:14.079]  I've noticed, being a minority, I've noticed this go on since the Reagan era.
[01:47:14.779 --> 01:47:18.282]  Reagan-Bush won when we had the drug war.
[01:47:19.002 --> 01:47:27.508]  It intensifies specifically in black communities only, and minority communities, because basically, you know, it's totally taken away.
[01:47:28.052 --> 01:47:28.472]  You're right.
[01:47:29.953 --> 01:47:30.933]  You're Fourth Amendment right.
[01:47:31.133 --> 01:47:32.074]  We just come in your house.
[01:47:32.714 --> 01:47:33.855]  No reason whatsoever.
[01:47:34.035 --> 01:47:34.935]  We're just going to come in there.
[01:47:35.235 --> 01:47:37.136]  And that was used as the training area.
[01:47:37.416 --> 01:47:38.257]  Now it's everywhere.
[01:47:38.437 --> 01:47:38.657]  Right.
[01:47:38.677 --> 01:47:42.459]  You know, you said one thing that was very prolific, and this is how I found you a couple years ago.
[01:47:42.819 --> 01:47:46.441]  You said that first they'll do it to the black community, then they'll do it to the white community.
[01:47:46.701 --> 01:47:50.423]  And what you're seeing is it's finally coming full circle, and it's happening now.
[01:47:50.443 --> 01:47:52.984]  15 years after the start of the quote-unquote, almost 20.
[01:47:53.709 --> 01:48:00.752]  After the quote-unquote war on drugs, we're full circle where everybody right now is going to be at the mercy of police.
[01:48:01.273 --> 01:48:19.381]  And here in Denver, we had like a police officer kill two retarded black kids back-to-back and he got a ten-month suspension and the police officers held a rally on the state capitol to protest that this guy got paid ten months with that leave.
[01:48:19.722 --> 01:48:20.602]  Didn't lose his job,
[01:48:21.536 --> 01:48:25.797]  No criminal action, nothing taken against him, but he just got 10 months without paying.
[01:48:25.817 --> 01:48:28.858]  The cops are out there at a rally, going crazy.
[01:48:28.898 --> 01:48:31.459]  Like, I thought I was in Nazi Germany.
[01:48:31.519 --> 01:48:32.719]  It's absolutely nuts out here.
[01:48:32.739 --> 01:48:44.922]  Well, I tell you, that's what happens when a small group, minority group, gets extra rights, more rights, super rights, and are protected by the establishment, the SS, the KGB, whatever you want to call it.
[01:48:45.282 --> 01:48:47.943]  This is the norm in history, like the Party in China.
[01:48:48.744 --> 01:48:53.146]  And look, this is my last point and we'll let our guest go.
[01:48:53.186 --> 01:48:54.306]  Let me give one point in too.
[01:48:54.566 --> 01:48:56.027]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:48:56.067 --> 01:49:11.932]  The problem is, it could be stopped immediately today because these city councils have the authority to place different legislation into effect to make these police accountable, like police review boards, which will actually be held by the citizenry, but they won't do it.
[01:49:12.193 --> 01:49:13.173]  City council members
[01:49:13.678 --> 01:49:17.540]  I hear you.
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:19.441]  I got to let you go.
[01:49:19.461 --> 01:49:20.982]  Really good points, Bob.
[01:49:22.102 --> 01:49:23.263]  Just finishing this story.
[01:49:23.483 --> 01:49:24.203]  I told it before.
[01:49:24.223 --> 01:49:29.506]  I went to the store to get some frozen yogurt, and I had it in the front seat.
[01:49:29.546 --> 01:49:31.367]  I had my weightlifting belt in the front seat.
[01:49:32.210 --> 01:49:36.076]  And the police officer pulls me over and he says, let me see your driver's license.
[01:49:36.136 --> 01:49:36.656]  I give it to him.
[01:49:37.137 --> 01:49:41.203]  And all of a sudden he pulls a gun out, puts it to my head, starts screaming, cussing, yelling, get out, get out.
[01:49:41.724 --> 01:49:46.410]  Then he sees that it's a white belt and he says, I'm sorry, don't speed again, you can go.
[01:49:47.509 --> 01:49:54.492]  I almost died, but I'm not against that officer just because at least he didn't beat me up and go ahead and take me to jail.
[01:49:54.972 --> 01:50:04.636]  Now if they see a weight belt or something and get scared, they're going to go ahead and take you to jail for something because just their overreaction means you must have done something wrong.
[01:50:05.116 --> 01:50:06.797]  Final comment on that, Mr. Warren?
[01:50:07.478 --> 01:50:19.026]  Well, I wish I could have represented you at that time, because I don't think that you should have been subjected to deadly force where you hadn't been a danger to the cop, nor had you committed any felony.
[01:50:19.486 --> 01:50:29.092]  I think the case of Tennessee v. Garner is very clear on that point, that they can't use deadly force unless you're a fleeing felon that's dangerous, or you're posing a danger to the cop.
[01:50:29.433 --> 01:50:31.034]  And a way belted no way does that.
[01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:35.944]  Well, I guess I'm just lucky he didn't go ahead and beat me up.
[01:50:36.004 --> 01:50:37.245]  I guess he wasn't a bad person.
[01:50:37.265 --> 01:50:38.746]  Lucky he didn't put a bullet in your head.
[01:50:39.127 --> 01:50:39.367]  Yeah.
[01:50:39.767 --> 01:50:44.753]  Okay, Mr. Warren, thank you for all your time and Ernest Warren there in Portland, Oregon.
[01:50:44.773 --> 01:50:45.934]  Thank you for having me.
[01:50:46.234 --> 01:50:46.574]  You bet.
[01:50:46.595 --> 01:50:47.335]  God bless you, sir.
[01:50:47.816 --> 01:50:48.176]  Take care.
[01:50:48.196 --> 01:50:51.720]  We'll come back and get into Patriot Act, the new Patriot Act legislation in your calls.
[01:50:54.787 --> 01:51:02.157]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:51:02.457 --> 01:51:07.203]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:51:07.403 --> 01:51:13.071]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:51:13.291 --> 01:51:17.814]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:51:18.034 --> 01:51:25.199]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:51:25.219 --> 01:51:26.019]  soil, the U.S.A.
[01:51:26.039 --> 01:51:29.762]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:51:29.922 --> 01:51:32.423]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:51:32.664 --> 01:51:39.368]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[01:51:53.843 --> 01:51:55.464]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:55.604 --> 01:51:59.726]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:51:59.846 --> 01:52:02.728]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:52:02.808 --> 01:52:09.491]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:52:09.571 --> 01:52:09.671]  Yes.
[01:52:09.691 --> 01:52:12.695]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:52:12.916 --> 01:52:15.299]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:52:15.459 --> 01:52:25.594]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as actazine, benzene, chloride and chloroform.
[01:52:25.794 --> 01:52:34.896]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum are extracted.
[01:52:35.056 --> 01:52:42.818]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:53:54.771 --> 01:53:57.513]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:53:57.534 --> 01:54:01.378]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:04.386 --> 01:54:11.152]  Look, it doesn't matter if it's Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George Herbert Walker Bush, George W. Bush.
[01:54:11.613 --> 01:54:12.594]  They're just puppets.
[01:54:13.955 --> 01:54:16.137]  And the drug war is to make us the enemy.
[01:54:16.217 --> 01:54:16.877]  It's a war.
[01:54:16.937 --> 01:54:18.038]  The police are the troops.
[01:54:18.419 --> 01:54:19.520]  We're now the civilians.
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:20.501]  It's a war.
[01:54:21.221 --> 01:54:23.403]  And they ship in the drugs to create the crisis.
[01:54:24.824 --> 01:54:29.549]  And, look, I've never been against the police, but I wade through
[01:54:30.805 --> 01:54:36.406]  They're corruption, they're drug dealing, they're whore running, they're everything they do.
[01:54:37.827 --> 01:54:44.688]  And I see less and less of helping change the flat tire, you know, helping get the cat out of the tree, more and more of the other.
[01:54:45.168 --> 01:54:58.631]  Police, wouldn't you like to go back to the days of getting the slice of pie and the free coffee and people waving at you and children, you know, at Christmas being given, you know, you know, the police set to play the part of the policeman when they're not playing cowboys and Indians?
[01:54:59.737 --> 01:55:01.257]  I mean, it's totally changed!
[01:55:01.297 --> 01:55:04.498]  You were once incredibly honored, and bad cops got in a lot of trouble.
[01:55:05.058 --> 01:55:08.219]  Now the bad cops are in control, the good cops are in trouble.
[01:55:10.139 --> 01:55:12.899]  And you ought to be ashamed of yourselves if you're a bad cop.
[01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:16.080]  You know, who thinks we're the enemy and we're bad.
[01:55:16.340 --> 01:55:17.840]  I mean, we're just the general public.
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:22.861]  We're made up of the same types of people that are, you know, in government or out of government.
[01:55:22.941 --> 01:55:24.962]  And we're not your property, we're not your slaves.
[01:55:25.342 --> 01:55:26.002]  We're going to go to
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:34.083]  Rodney, Woody hung up and then Tim and Mark and Dan and many many others here in just a second.
[01:55:35.344 --> 01:55:36.564]  I do need to get into news.
[01:55:37.325 --> 01:55:46.589]  We'll go through a full bank of calls and then I'll go back into Patriot Act enhancement provides death penalty for any federal crime punishable by over one year in jail.
[01:55:48.030 --> 01:55:53.953]  And this is on PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com as well.
[01:55:54.633 --> 01:55:56.674]  We'll be going over some of the subsections out of it.
[01:55:57.607 --> 01:56:07.836]  Also, we'll get into what's happening in Iraq and just a bunch of really important police state news I haven't even scratched the surface on, but I will get to all this news.
[01:56:07.876 --> 01:56:10.898]  I'm not going to wait and then run out of time in the next hour.
[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:14.882]  I'd also like to hear from police officers out there.
[01:56:15.042 --> 01:56:21.367]  We've had police chiefs and others call in before agreeing with us, fire chiefs, you name it, but I'd like to hear from police officers
[01:56:22.237 --> 01:56:31.801]  Who either disagree with me about this, we'll treat you with respect, or who agree with what I'm saying, or have an addendum you want to add, about the mindset, how it's changed.
[01:56:31.881 --> 01:56:36.143]  Because I want to know how I got a gun put to my head because of a weight belt in the front seat.
[01:56:37.724 --> 01:56:39.265]  And how you think that's normal.
[01:56:40.545 --> 01:56:46.088]  I mean, statistically, the most dangerous thing you face in your life, at least, is other police.
[01:56:46.148 --> 01:56:47.588]  I've got the federal numbers on that.
[01:56:47.868 --> 01:56:48.949]  They don't like to publicize.
[01:56:50.231 --> 01:56:55.056]  If you're on a SWAT team, your number one cause of death is that guy with the shotgun behind you.
[01:56:56.737 --> 01:57:02.923]  More often than not, there's been a bunch of cases where they catch cops killing their own people on accident, and then trying to frame somebody.
[01:57:03.463 --> 01:57:10.750]  I mean, I've probably seen ten of those in the last two years in Texas alone, and not just the ones where they catch them.
[01:57:13.332 --> 01:57:14.834]  Also, last night I, uh,
[01:57:15.809 --> 01:57:17.451]  Listened to Fox Television News.
[01:57:17.491 --> 01:57:20.853]  I have a Walkman and at the gym I can listen to TV on it.
[01:57:21.614 --> 01:57:22.515]  Got the TV band.
[01:57:22.575 --> 01:57:25.277]  I just listened to it and kind of took mental notes.
[01:57:25.337 --> 01:57:26.738]  It was all propaganda.
[01:57:27.799 --> 01:57:29.180]  It's not conservative at all.
[01:57:31.502 --> 01:57:32.123]  It's incredible.
[01:57:32.523 --> 01:57:37.948]  Before I end this hour, though, just briefly, if you're online, we've launched PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:57:37.968 --> 01:57:40.610]  You can sign up via PayPal or credit card.

[01:57:41.070 --> 01:57:41.291]  That's
[01:57:44.665 --> 01:57:45.766]  Nineteen cents a day.
[01:57:45.846 --> 01:57:47.749]  If you get a year, it's fifteen cents a day.
[01:57:48.570 --> 01:57:55.378]  Video reports, news reports every week, print reports, audio, video, everything.
[01:57:55.418 --> 01:57:56.419]  I'm really proud of it.
[01:57:56.759 --> 01:57:58.421]  We're putting a lot of work into it.
[01:57:58.722 --> 01:58:00.424]  I'll be putting together a report tomorrow night.
[01:58:00.444 --> 01:58:01.505]  It'll be about five hours.
[01:58:01.845 --> 01:58:03.187]  The new hourly video report.

[01:58:41.330 --> 01:58:41.990]  Please stay with us.
[01:58:44.372 --> 01:58:44.992]  Hello, folks.
[01:58:45.092 --> 01:58:46.013]  Alex Jones here.
[01:58:46.133 --> 01:58:50.256]  You know, Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:58:50.376 --> 01:58:53.278]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:58:53.338 --> 01:58:59.983]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:59:00.223 --> 01:59:03.224]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:59:03.424 --> 01:59:05.805]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:59:05.945 --> 01:59:16.049]  Black-Murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as actazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[01:59:16.089 --> 01:59:25.412]  For MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[01:59:25.572 --> 01:59:33.335]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:59:51.821 --> 01:59:52.881]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:53.582 --> 01:59:54.703]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:55.343 --> 01:59:56.164]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.925 --> 01:59:58.846]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:58.866 --> 02:00:02.289]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.669 --> 02:00:06.792]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.034 --> 02:00:09.595]  Alright!
[02:00:12.057 --> 02:00:14.318]  Is George Bush brain damaged?
[02:00:14.599 --> 02:00:16.000]  A lot of evidence shows.
[02:00:18.334 --> 02:00:22.176]  I guess after listening to the story about this elderly lady,
[02:00:45.660 --> 02:00:51.043]  I can empathize with her because one, I'm visually impaired or totally blind.
[02:00:51.543 --> 02:01:01.288]  And my question that I'm asking is rhetorical question is, is this what the old and infirm in this country has to look forward to now?
[02:01:01.308 --> 02:01:09.112]  I mean, I use a cane to help me to be mobile when I'm walking about.
[02:01:10.007 --> 02:01:28.158]  Well, she was sitting on the ground, begging him not to take her, the wagon she had that her 95 year old mother gave her, she's now 71, and the cop stepped on her hand, hit her in the back of the head, hazed her five times, savagely attacked the 95 year old woman when she brought water to her daughter who'd been pepper sprayed.
[02:01:28.399 --> 02:01:35.303]  Right, but I guess what I'm saying is, you use your own stuff as an example of how police officers are
[02:01:36.294 --> 02:01:39.136]  Mistakenly accusing people of having weapons.
[02:01:39.216 --> 02:01:42.619]  Now, I use a cane to get around.
[02:01:43.919 --> 02:01:46.221]  Are they going to do the same thing to me also?
[02:01:46.241 --> 02:01:51.244]  Sir, we've actually seen cases where they have charged blind people for having the cane as a weapon.
[02:01:52.565 --> 02:02:01.792]  Like I said, is this what the old and infirm in this country, since they passed the Patriot Act and other laws, you know, to implement these
[02:02:02.959 --> 02:02:07.720]  You know, police tactics or military tactics on the citizens.
[02:02:08.100 --> 02:02:09.960]  Is this what we have to look forward to?
[02:02:10.361 --> 02:02:15.562]  I think it is, sir, and I appreciate your call, Rodney, and I think we all have to look forward to it until we take this country back.
[02:02:16.122 --> 02:02:17.202]  Dan in Oregon.
[02:02:17.242 --> 02:02:18.062]  Dan, go ahead.
[02:02:19.923 --> 02:02:20.783]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:02:21.263 --> 02:02:21.623]  Welcome.
[02:02:23.123 --> 02:02:32.005]  Living in the Portland area for 45 years, I might be able to give a little bit of a local perspective to the way I see what's happening.
[02:02:32.915 --> 02:02:39.318]  A lot of people don't realize, but Portland has been a testing laboratory for the New World Order for a number of years.
[02:02:39.678 --> 02:02:51.082]  Well, that's where, a couple years ago, Bush came for a speech, and the police admittedly attacked 6,000 peaceful people, ran up, sprayed pepper spray in babies' faces, and the family said, why are you doing that?
[02:02:51.102 --> 02:02:52.803]  And he said, you shouldn't bring them to a protest.
[02:02:53.143 --> 02:02:55.204]  That's true, and it goes back a lot further than that.
[02:02:55.224 --> 02:02:58.245]  It goes back to Chief Moose.
[02:02:58.325 --> 02:03:00.226]  You've heard his name in the news, I'm sure.
[02:03:00.943 --> 02:03:03.564]  Ah yes, up at the sniper situation.
[02:03:03.945 --> 02:03:07.126]  Yeah, who brought him back there but Janet Reno.
[02:03:07.886 --> 02:03:29.837]  See, Janet took Moose under her wing, he left Portland, went back there, but before he left, he and a sheriff out in Portland, Oregon, teamed up to run into a Gypsy Joker motorcycle gang and set them up
[02:03:30.898 --> 02:03:59.079]  and uh... kill some of them and some other police officers were killed that went to court and the gypsy jokers one now that they were saying that one it's almost like the words going out that to get promoted you've got to be brutal you've got to be ruthless and when you're bad that's how you go up you gotta be dirty they gotta get some dirt on you that way they can use you but you see the perspective that i see with this these elderly ladies
[02:04:00.410 --> 02:04:09.218]  The Portland area has been taking some real heat from the black community because of the deaths of these other black people that has been going on for a year or so.
[02:04:09.278 --> 02:04:12.401]  Two or three people have been shot, as you have already brought out.
[02:04:12.922 --> 02:04:16.625]  Well, the news in Portland runs with the city.
[02:04:16.805 --> 02:04:21.890]  KATU is not going to do anything that they're not instructed to do.
[02:04:23.314 --> 02:04:25.875]  And I'll explain the rest of it after the break, if you want.
[02:04:26.295 --> 02:04:26.575]  Sure.
[02:04:26.735 --> 02:04:29.696]  But again, we're just talking about Portland because it's a microcosm.
[02:04:30.156 --> 02:04:32.617]  Believe me, everybody thinks their area is the testing ground.
[02:04:32.637 --> 02:04:33.957]  I have to admit, Portland and L.A.
[02:04:34.017 --> 02:04:34.557]  really are.
[02:04:35.657 --> 02:04:36.798]  But, I mean, it's everywhere.
[02:04:37.118 --> 02:04:39.758]  And we'll let you continue briefly because I've got a lot of calls here.
[02:04:40.499 --> 02:04:42.699]  Tim and Mark and Dylan and everybody else.
[02:04:42.719 --> 02:04:42.759]  800-259-9231.
[02:04:47.139 --> 02:04:49.201]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[02:04:49.381 --> 02:04:51.022]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot!
[02:04:51.142 --> 02:04:59.129]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[02:04:59.369 --> 02:05:05.815]  Imagine, hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini, followed by peaches, mixed fruit, or pineapple for dessert.
[02:05:05.995 --> 02:05:07.236]  Just a few of the many selections.
[02:05:07.456 --> 02:05:10.799]  Visit www.longlifefood.com for a complete menu.
[02:05:10.959 --> 02:05:14.522]  Both FEMA and the Red Cross have suggested having food stored in case of disaster.
[02:05:14.742 --> 02:05:20.246]  The Long Life Food Depot was recently mentioned in the USA Today article on the very subject of emergency preparations.
[02:05:20.566 --> 02:05:23.288]  It makes sense to be prepared and Long Life Food Depot makes it easy.
[02:05:23.488 --> 02:05:27.491]  Long-term storable MREs make for convenience when camping, hiking or canoeing.
[02:05:27.711 --> 02:05:28.612]  No fires allowed?

[02:05:50.448 --> 02:05:54.892]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:05:55.012 --> 02:05:59.396]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:05:59.456 --> 02:06:00.777]  The New World Order.
[02:06:01.257 --> 02:06:02.919]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:06:16.334 --> 02:06:26.642]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:06:26.923 --> 02:06:32.287]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:06:56.529 --> 02:07:04.110]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:07:04.390 --> 02:07:07.491]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:07:07.771 --> 02:07:13.538]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:07:13.819 --> 02:07:19.986]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:07:20.347 --> 02:07:24.232]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:07:24.272 --> 02:07:26.154]  The water level is always visible.
[02:07:26.334 --> 02:07:32.296]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.

[02:07:50.688 --> 02:07:51.328]  Big Brother.
[02:07:51.989 --> 02:07:53.050]  Mainstream media.
[02:07:53.770 --> 02:07:54.871]  Government cover-ups.
[02:07:55.512 --> 02:07:56.352]  You want answers?
[02:07:57.093 --> 02:07:58.014]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:58.674 --> 02:08:02.498]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:02.838 --> 02:08:06.981]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:12.266 --> 02:08:16.890]  Government power is something that historically is always very dangerous.
[02:08:17.540 --> 02:08:18.640]  That's why you've got to limit it.
[02:08:18.820 --> 02:08:19.400]  Control it.
[02:08:19.660 --> 02:08:20.121]  Watch it.
[02:08:21.721 --> 02:08:24.982]  But the government today says, hey, we've been attacked by terrorists at every level.
[02:08:25.042 --> 02:08:25.742]  Do what we say.
[02:08:25.902 --> 02:08:26.342]  Shut up.
[02:08:26.802 --> 02:08:27.762]  Follow our orders.
[02:08:28.722 --> 02:08:31.663]  It's a climate of fear and oppression, and I'm sick of it.
[02:08:31.703 --> 02:08:32.903]  I'm tired of the propaganda.
[02:08:33.844 --> 02:08:45.266]  Now, just briefly, I'm going to let our caller in Oregon, Don, finish up, and then we're going to go to all the other great people that are patiently holding
[02:08:46.174 --> 02:08:47.875]  But they're in Portland, Oregon.
[02:08:47.895 --> 02:08:48.975]  Finish up what you were saying.
[02:08:49.676 --> 02:08:54.638]  Well, Alex, they've been very effective in alienating the black community.
[02:08:54.878 --> 02:09:02.681]  The people are going out in groups now around the city protesting, and so they've got them where they want them.
[02:09:03.141 --> 02:09:07.203]  They've got the police alienated against the black, even with a black police chief.
[02:09:07.783 --> 02:09:12.925]  Now the next step they're going to take is they're going to alienate the whites, and that's exactly what they want.
[02:09:13.025 --> 02:09:14.706]  So they have the polarization
[02:09:15.157 --> 02:09:16.958]  Between the police and the people.
[02:09:17.219 --> 02:09:18.740]  Yeah, that's gang member mentality.
[02:09:18.780 --> 02:09:20.701]  They've told the police they're really your enemy.
[02:09:21.082 --> 02:09:21.962]  They're a bad group.
[02:09:21.982 --> 02:09:23.083]  They don't know what we go through.
[02:09:23.123 --> 02:09:24.664]  We've got to all stick together.
[02:09:25.085 --> 02:09:26.866]  We've got to hold together society.
[02:09:26.906 --> 02:09:27.967]  They're all crazy.
[02:09:28.207 --> 02:09:34.172]  This has all been very well manipulated and the news is playing right along with them.
[02:09:34.692 --> 02:09:37.614]  Because the folks at the top are pulling the strings.
[02:09:38.595 --> 02:09:39.256]  I agree with you.
[02:09:39.296 --> 02:09:41.177]  This is done by design.
[02:09:41.197 --> 02:09:41.718]  Thanks for the call.
[02:09:43.338 --> 02:09:47.602]  We'll go to Tim and Mark and Dylan and H.W.
[02:09:47.642 --> 02:09:56.570]  here in just a moment, then into all that Patriot Act and Iraq news, but for the next three or four minutes, we're joined by Debbie Morrow from New Millennium Concept, who joins us a few times a week.
[02:09:57.351 --> 02:10:07.980]  Look, there's a lot you can't control in this world, but one thing you can do is stop drinking the mercury, the Prozac, the Ritalin, the dead bacteria, the fluoride,
[02:10:09.207 --> 02:10:13.232]  The MBTE, all the stuff that's in the water supplies.
[02:10:14.954 --> 02:10:22.044]  It is now time to get a high quality purification, not a filter, a purification system that gets it out of there.
[02:10:22.624 --> 02:10:26.890]  A lot of these cheap filters you get just take some of the taste out, and it's made in America,
[02:10:27.822 --> 02:10:33.347]  And it's what I use, and it will do tens of thousands of gallons, last you many years.
[02:10:33.867 --> 02:10:36.869]  It's a great system, takes a few minutes to put together.
[02:10:37.370 --> 02:10:41.013]  I'm not very mechanically inclined, it takes me about 60 seconds to put a big Berkey together.
[02:10:41.914 --> 02:10:43.735]  Debbie, good to have you on the broadcast.
[02:10:43.915 --> 02:10:45.917]  Hi Alex, glad to be here.
[02:10:45.937 --> 02:10:47.638]  Appreciate it.
[02:10:48.359 --> 02:10:55.545]  We really have been having a lot of customers call lately telling me about the things that are in the newspaper.
[02:10:56.377 --> 02:11:06.220]  about their water and you know it always makes me a little curious when they start advertising in the newspaper and ads and stuff that the water is bad you know?
[02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:09.201]  It makes me wonder what's going on.
[02:11:09.562 --> 02:11:14.323]  Look, when you create a section on the website it'd be thousands of articles every year or so.
[02:11:14.543 --> 02:11:16.424]  Every day I see news articles
[02:11:17.222 --> 02:11:21.104]  Where they found Prozac in Colorado, Prozac in Dallas in the water.
[02:11:21.504 --> 02:11:27.126]  Massive levels, Ritalin, birth control pills, high levels of fluoride, chlorine, mercury, arsenic.
[02:11:27.786 --> 02:11:30.827]  I mean, look folks, drink good purified water.
[02:11:31.247 --> 02:11:32.568]  I don't mean junky bottled water.
[02:11:32.648 --> 02:11:36.990]  Drink good purified water, then try to drink your tap water that you thought was so good.
[02:11:37.010 --> 02:11:41.111]  I mean, how anybody doesn't filter their water, I can't figure out, Debbie.
[02:11:41.491 --> 02:11:44.753]  I can't either, because it's such a simple thing you can do for your health.
[02:11:45.173 --> 02:11:45.793]  You know, there are many
[02:11:46.377 --> 02:11:46.737]  I think so.
[02:12:06.946 --> 02:12:08.107]  The stuff they're drinking is water.
[02:12:08.127 --> 02:12:15.534]  Well, yeah, the doctors now are saying, you've got chronic fatigue, stop using the shampoo you're using, and start drinking filtered water.
[02:12:15.834 --> 02:12:31.749]  I had a veterinarian here in Capell, right down the road from me, call me yesterday, and he only gives the animals in his clinic Berkey water, and also for the customers that come in, he has Berkey set up in the waiting room.
[02:12:32.322 --> 02:12:35.644]  And he faxed me over a thing on liver disease in animals.
[02:12:35.664 --> 02:12:38.965]  He said there's been a lot of liver disease in the animals.
[02:12:39.746 --> 02:12:44.208]  And so he sent me over a fax on treatment for it.
[02:12:44.228 --> 02:12:51.492]  And one of the things is he puts on there to give them purified water from British Birkfield Water Filters and Big Berkies.
[02:12:51.872 --> 02:12:54.893]  And he puts our number on it and he gives it to all of his clients.
[02:12:55.053 --> 02:12:55.914]  Well, that's awesome.
[02:12:56.234 --> 02:12:58.335]  Listen, you've got several different specials.
[02:12:59.235 --> 02:13:07.320]  You've now got the Sheltering in Place video put together by a doctor who worked for the federal government, chemical, biological, radiological.
[02:13:07.861 --> 02:13:09.242]  You've got that on video.
[02:13:09.782 --> 02:13:20.209]  You've also got the Prudent Places CD with 500 plus color maps, safe places to be, where chemical and weapons dumps are in your area.
[02:13:20.569 --> 02:13:21.330]  Great thing to have.
[02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:22.330]  You can get both those free.
[02:13:22.350 --> 02:13:24.492]  You can get the Berkey light with the light system.
[02:13:25.733 --> 02:13:28.835]  You get one of those if you get the $1.99 system without the lights.
[02:13:29.620 --> 02:13:30.982]  You've got a bunch of other specials.
[02:13:31.022 --> 02:13:32.684]  People really should give Debbie a call.
[02:13:33.145 --> 02:13:35.728]  If you call and it's busy, leave your name and number and she'll call you right back.
[02:13:35.748 --> 02:13:36.429]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:13:36.469 --> 02:13:36.669]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:13:45.740 --> 02:13:52.362]  Or go to Infowars.com, link through to the shopping cart, and they take the orders off of it every day, and order one.
[02:13:52.843 --> 02:13:58.025]  And it's made in America, and it also goes to sponsor this show and make this broadcast possible.
[02:13:58.065 --> 02:14:03.226]  But number one, it's healthy for you and your family.
[02:14:03.246 --> 02:14:03.466]  888-803-4438.
[02:14:03.867 --> 02:14:07.468]  And Debbie, you still have the sports filtration system.
[02:14:07.508 --> 02:14:10.309]  It doesn't cut everything out like the big murky light.
[02:14:11.293 --> 02:14:12.835]  But it cuts out a lot of it.
[02:14:12.975 --> 02:14:14.436]  Much cleaner than bottled water.
[02:14:14.456 --> 02:14:16.598]  600 and something refills.
[02:14:18.279 --> 02:14:19.240]  Great little system.
[02:14:19.260 --> 02:14:22.102]  You get how many of these for $100?
[02:14:22.142 --> 02:14:23.043]  You get 5 for $100.
[02:14:23.083 --> 02:14:25.945]  And they're normally $39 each.
[02:14:25.985 --> 02:14:28.647]  So it's a really good savings.
[02:14:28.707 --> 02:14:29.828]  They make great gifts.
[02:14:29.888 --> 02:14:31.510]  You take them everywhere with you.
[02:14:31.950 --> 02:14:33.451]  Take them camping, hiking.
[02:14:33.511 --> 02:14:36.694]  And we take them to work instead of drinking the water out of the faucet.
[02:14:37.227 --> 02:14:41.146]  You know the fountain or the tap at work, you know, take your sport bottle and just
[02:14:41.618 --> 02:14:44.099]  You know, squeeze your water into a cup at work.
[02:14:44.319 --> 02:14:46.900]  Well, Violet, my wife, she takes it to the gym.
[02:14:47.961 --> 02:14:54.904]  And when she's out on the road somewhere, you know, for the kids, she fills it up and gives that to them.
[02:14:55.184 --> 02:14:56.785]  Well, listen, the toll-free number, 1-888-803-4438.
[02:14:57.045 --> 02:15:01.547]  And Debbie will be there.
[02:15:01.587 --> 02:15:02.287]  Debbie, thank you.
[02:15:02.467 --> 02:15:03.147]  Thank you.
[02:15:03.207 --> 02:15:04.328]  Y'all have a great day.
[02:15:04.548 --> 02:15:05.128]  You too, Debbie.
[02:15:05.528 --> 02:15:06.849]  Alright, let's go right back to the calls.
[02:15:06.869 --> 02:15:07.549]  Thanks for holding.
[02:15:07.829 --> 02:15:09.090]  Next up is in Minnesota.
[02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:10.531]  Mark in Minnesota.
[02:15:10.551 --> 02:15:10.991]  Go ahead.
[02:15:11.542 --> 02:15:12.243]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[02:15:12.563 --> 02:15:12.904]  Pretty good.
[02:15:13.304 --> 02:15:28.984]  I think if you give the wrong look to a police officer, they should be entitled to beat you up, and if they scrape their fists or bruise their knuckles from the impact of hitting you, you should then be charged with
[02:15:29.688 --> 02:15:30.629]  You know, salt and battery.
[02:15:31.029 --> 02:15:32.190]  Well, I wouldn't joke around.
[02:15:32.230 --> 02:15:33.911]  That's already the unofficial law.
[02:15:34.171 --> 02:15:35.252]  Yeah, of course.
[02:15:35.652 --> 02:15:36.072]  I'm kidding.
[02:15:36.392 --> 02:15:38.854]  But, no, I mean, that is the way it is.
[02:15:39.434 --> 02:15:45.158]  Yeah, don't, you know, God forbid if they scrape their knuckles, you know, as they're beating you to a pulp, you know.
[02:15:45.738 --> 02:15:47.579]  Otherwise, that's the charges right there, right?
[02:15:48.100 --> 02:15:58.066]  But, there was actually a case about a year ago, I believe, it wasn't that long ago, it was up here in Minneapolis, where somebody had
[02:15:59.139 --> 02:16:28.640]  uh... came across uh... a crime and so they called the uh... you know called up for the police uh... you know uh... police show up and uh... the minneapolis police department and uh... don't ask questions and as we come up on the blazing and they shoot uh... in a shooting this person uh... and uh... it the person was unarmed uh... and there's a person called the police and they put it apparently they thought it was the suspect
[02:16:29.418 --> 02:16:34.262]  And they probably could have gotten away with lying about the whole thing and saying the person was armed.
[02:16:34.662 --> 02:16:37.464]  Save one problem, one little technicality.
[02:16:37.544 --> 02:16:42.888]  The person that was shot, who actually called in the police, happened to be a police officer himself.
[02:16:43.709 --> 02:16:48.952]  And you're right, cops probably pose a much bigger threat to each other.
[02:16:48.973 --> 02:16:49.573]  No, no, no.
[02:16:49.693 --> 02:16:50.654]  Not probably.
[02:16:50.674 --> 02:16:52.895]  I've seen the Justice Department numbers.
[02:16:52.915 --> 02:16:53.796]  The last time I did was in 2001.
[02:16:55.470 --> 02:16:58.751]  I mean, we've had a bunch of cases where they shoot their own people right here in Austin.
[02:16:59.452 --> 02:17:06.234]  One cop will show up, go in the house, it's a domestic disturbance, he comes walking out, even with a flashlight, they shoot him, you know, with shotguns.
[02:17:06.894 --> 02:17:08.095]  I mean, they do it all the time.
[02:17:08.575 --> 02:17:21.200]  Yeah, it's definitely, in fact, it turned out that the cop who did the shooting, he's in the National Guard and had deployed to the Middle East and everything.
[02:17:21.593 --> 02:17:30.195]  And really, and I say this, of course, as somebody who's served in the Marine Corps, you know, I'm almost wondering, maybe, you know, fire and military service should not be allowed to be police officers, and I'm not kidding.
[02:17:31.075 --> 02:17:43.677]  Because, you know what, they're two totally different things, and I notice it seems like there are a lot of military veterans who go on to become police officers, but I think that they might have the wrong mentality.
[02:17:43.697 --> 02:17:46.177]  They almost see themselves as an occupying force.
[02:17:46.938 --> 02:17:49.538]  And they call us civilians, thanks for the call.
[02:17:50.339 --> 02:18:00.448]  Certainly, they need to stop giving the police military-style training for the general public, and they need to retrain them, reprogram them to be peace officers.
[02:18:00.488 --> 02:18:01.088]  But they don't.
[02:18:01.128 --> 02:18:03.310]  That's why they love them from the military.
[02:18:03.350 --> 02:18:06.793]  They come right out of martial law Iraq to America.
[02:18:08.094 --> 02:18:09.455]  Coming up, we're going to get into all that.
[02:18:09.916 --> 02:18:11.037]  We're going to get into the draft.
[02:18:11.077 --> 02:18:13.979]  We're going to get into the new Patriot Act, another version.
[02:18:14.420 --> 02:18:15.821]  We're going to get into all of it.
[02:18:15.861 --> 02:18:18.783]  Right now, let's talk to Tim in Wisconsin.
[02:18:18.803 --> 02:18:19.504]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:18:20.220 --> 02:18:20.900]  I hear you.
[02:18:20.920 --> 02:18:21.641]  Thanks for the call, Tim.
[02:18:21.661 --> 02:18:22.561]  Look, earlier
[02:18:45.470 --> 02:18:46.831]  One of the callers brought this up.
[02:18:46.871 --> 02:18:48.032]  This is part of a plan.
[02:18:48.052 --> 02:18:50.533]  They have psychological warfare blueprints to do this.
[02:18:50.914 --> 02:18:53.895]  They give the police policies that make the people hate them.
[02:18:55.416 --> 02:18:58.879]  Then that makes the police feel like everybody doesn't like them, rightfully so.
[02:18:59.379 --> 02:19:03.942]  Then that compacts their culture even more and then intensifies it.
[02:19:04.002 --> 02:19:05.463]  So it's kind of a feedback loop.
[02:19:06.664 --> 02:19:08.865]  We've got to somehow change that.
[02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:16.524]  Because police, your daughter, your son's going to be in another town, and they're going to get killed by your goon buddies.
[02:19:17.385 --> 02:19:18.565]  You're going to get killed by them.
[02:19:19.606 --> 02:19:21.827]  You better watch out from your own people.
[02:19:22.408 --> 02:19:23.328]  You better look out.
[02:19:24.069 --> 02:19:25.410]  Now, I'm talking about statistics.
[02:19:25.470 --> 02:19:26.490]  I'm talking about numbers.
[02:19:26.550 --> 02:19:28.212]  I'm talking about facts here.
[02:19:28.232 --> 02:19:33.335]  I'm not talking about, you know, how you feel or what they told you.
[02:19:34.876 --> 02:19:36.217]  Alright, we'll come back and talk to
[02:19:37.395 --> 02:19:38.495]  Dylan and H.W.
[02:19:38.636 --> 02:19:41.677]  and then that's it for calls for a while because I want to get into all this other news.
[02:19:41.697 --> 02:19:43.337]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:19:47.859 --> 02:19:48.900]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:19:49.220 --> 02:19:52.001]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:19:52.281 --> 02:19:56.423]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:19:56.863 --> 02:19:57.683]  So what do you do?
[02:19:58.003 --> 02:20:02.565]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:20:03.055 --> 02:20:05.176]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:20:05.676 --> 02:20:20.360]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:20:20.400 --> 02:20:27.462]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:20:27.822 --> 02:20:32.226]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[02:20:32.667 --> 02:20:34.449]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[02:20:34.469 --> 02:20:34.689]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:20:34.769 --> 02:20:36.250]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[02:20:45.669 --> 02:20:48.492]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[02:20:48.613 --> 02:20:49.453]  Michael Trudeau here.
[02:20:49.574 --> 02:20:52.877]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[02:20:53.078 --> 02:20:58.724]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[02:20:58.864 --> 02:21:01.888]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[02:21:02.148 --> 02:21:06.430]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[02:21:06.610 --> 02:21:08.511]  The chronic, everyday pain was miserable.
[02:21:08.651 --> 02:21:15.695]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[02:21:15.895 --> 02:21:18.356]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[02:21:18.656 --> 02:21:22.979]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice, only this time it changed my life.
[02:21:23.279 --> 02:21:25.020]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement.
[02:21:25.120 --> 02:21:27.222]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[02:21:27.402 --> 02:21:29.843]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[02:21:29.903 --> 02:21:32.605]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[02:21:32.785 --> 02:21:33.325]  Side effects?
[02:21:33.486 --> 02:21:35.767]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now too.
[02:21:35.927 --> 02:21:37.228]  Call Kliscott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[02:21:37.248 --> 02:21:37.468]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[02:21:37.508 --> 02:21:38.669]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[02:21:38.689 --> 02:21:39.409]  It worked for me.
[02:21:45.613 --> 02:21:50.335]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[02:21:50.575 --> 02:21:53.996]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[02:21:54.216 --> 02:21:56.677]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[02:21:56.917 --> 02:22:05.521]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[02:22:05.881 --> 02:22:11.663]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[02:22:11.923 --> 02:22:13.884]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[02:22:14.124 --> 02:22:21.068]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.
[02:22:21.408 --> 02:22:27.871]  Midas Resources is pleased to offer a subscription to the International Forecaster newsletter free of charge with a qualifying order.
[02:22:28.131 --> 02:22:35.455]  That's right, for a limited time, Midas Resources is offering a one-year subscription to Bob Chapman's powerful newsletter, the International Forecaster.
[02:22:35.715 --> 02:22:40.160]  Call 800-686-2237 for more information or to place your order.
[02:22:40.260 --> 02:22:40.961]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:41.221 --> 02:22:45.085]  Call today and avoid getting soaked tomorrow.
[02:22:45.545 --> 02:22:48.328]  What kind of gift can you give to someone who has everything?
[02:22:48.749 --> 02:22:49.830]  Are you running out of ideas?
[02:22:50.290 --> 02:22:50.911]  Out of time?
[02:22:51.392 --> 02:22:54.575]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?
[02:22:55.239 --> 02:22:58.101]  Well, think of a song, written especially for them.
[02:22:58.382 --> 02:23:06.328]  And all you have to do is go to www.songsforever.com and provide us all the information about that special someone.
[02:23:06.748 --> 02:23:10.031]  Interesting facts, unique things about him, and all you can think of.
[02:23:10.391 --> 02:23:18.397]  Songsforever.com will use that information brought to us by you to compose a unique song with original lyrics inspired by everything you've told us.
[02:23:18.978 --> 02:23:19.478]  Just listen.
[02:23:27.824 --> 02:23:33.027]  Birthday coming soon?
[02:23:33.428 --> 02:23:34.108]  Anniversary?
[02:23:34.608 --> 02:23:35.349]  Wedding, perhaps?
[02:23:35.929 --> 02:23:36.910]  Mother's Day's coming up?
[02:23:37.450 --> 02:23:41.413]  Just go to www.songsforever.com.
[02:23:41.874 --> 02:23:44.956]  That's www.songsforever.com.
[02:23:50.940 --> 02:23:52.841]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:23:53.322 --> 02:23:56.104]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:58.477 --> 02:24:11.781]  Throughout time immemorial, human history, the human condition has been an oppressive group of enforcers working for despots, dominating and abusing populations.
[02:24:11.881 --> 02:24:13.542]  And America was supposed to be different.
[02:24:14.702 --> 02:24:21.184]  And it was, if you weren't a Native American or if you weren't black, those were kind of the subgroups that didn't have rights.
[02:24:21.764 --> 02:24:24.905]  Now all of us get to enjoy being slaves.
[02:24:25.931 --> 02:24:32.436]  And it was wrong what we did to the Native Americans, wrong what happened to blacks, and it's just as wrong that it's happening to everybody else now.
[02:24:34.398 --> 02:24:36.120]  And it's very serious.
[02:24:36.620 --> 02:24:37.721]  Dylan in Texas.
[02:24:37.761 --> 02:24:38.622]  Dylan, go ahead.
[02:24:39.382 --> 02:24:40.003]  Howdy, Alex.
[02:24:40.443 --> 02:24:42.024]  I hope you're doing real good today.
[02:24:43.306 --> 02:24:46.408]  Gee, that story is really emotional.
[02:24:46.548 --> 02:24:48.310]  I don't want to underplay it.
[02:24:49.050 --> 02:24:51.933]  I hit a strong emotional note with myself.
[02:24:55.889 --> 02:25:22.314]  I haven't witnessed, I've never been a victim of police brutality but I have been a direct witness especially within arm's reach of police brutality on a number of times and it certainly sounds like the same old story but getting a little bit closer all the time to being mainstream news for that quote unquote middle class of America and
[02:25:25.512 --> 02:25:27.053]  We all know that people need to wake up.
[02:25:27.093 --> 02:25:37.842]  We know that these officers took oath to the Constitution, and we sort of know that those officers obviously never knew what the Constitution was or what it stood for.
[02:25:39.704 --> 02:25:43.127]  But we've also got the Ten Commandments, and this isn't just a document.
[02:25:43.147 --> 02:25:46.710]  This is inscribed on the hearts of human beings.
[02:25:51.800 --> 02:25:53.161]  What happened, Alex?
[02:25:53.221 --> 02:25:56.244]  What do you think happened to those cops to make them that way?
[02:25:57.044 --> 02:25:58.825]  Well, I appreciate the call, Dylan.
[02:25:58.845 --> 02:26:01.827]  Let me try to answer that briefly because I've got a lot of news I want to get to.
[02:26:01.847 --> 02:26:05.110]  And I talked about this earlier in the last hour.
[02:26:07.592 --> 02:26:15.897]  I can't really bring myself to watch a lot of television, though I should, because the propaganda's in the sitcoms, the drama's not just on the news channels.
[02:26:17.599 --> 02:26:20.501]  And yesterday I was working out and I've
[02:26:21.849 --> 02:26:24.891]  I've got a Walkman that's also got a TV band on it.
[02:26:26.071 --> 02:26:32.015]  And a few weeks ago I actually pushed it for the first time for listening to TV shows, just listening to the audio.
[02:26:33.836 --> 02:26:45.182]  And so I sat there for an hour on an exercise bicycle trying to work off some of the blubber that I've accumulated doing this radio show sitting here.
[02:26:46.421 --> 02:26:52.206]  And I listened to the entire Fox News piece here locally and then some national news.
[02:26:54.068 --> 02:26:56.029]  And the local Fox News went like this.
[02:26:57.110 --> 02:26:58.712]  A lot of you probably saw the same thing in your area.
[02:26:59.292 --> 02:27:04.216]  Anyone's coming out with compulsory national ID cards that are so good, we need them too.
[02:27:04.616 --> 02:27:06.318]  National ID cards keep you safe.
[02:27:07.078 --> 02:27:11.042]  Look out, there'll be more drug dogs on the street in your schools keeping you safe.
[02:27:11.102 --> 02:27:12.203]  Please submit the searches.
[02:27:13.882 --> 02:27:14.503]  Next piece.
[02:27:15.043 --> 02:27:19.486]  Al-Qaeda is planning to attack you any minute, but Bush says we must repass the Patriot Act.
[02:27:19.586 --> 02:27:20.086]  It's good.
[02:27:21.387 --> 02:27:23.408]  I sat there mentally wanting to take down notes.
[02:27:23.448 --> 02:27:24.389]  I told my wife about it.
[02:27:24.949 --> 02:27:26.830]  There was like ten things in the piece.
[02:27:27.491 --> 02:27:28.591]  I can't remember them all now.
[02:27:30.132 --> 02:27:37.357]  But basically, the whole newscast was how good the new world order is.
[02:27:39.415 --> 02:27:42.898]  And if you'd have heard that newscast ten years ago, you'd have thought you'd woken up in the Twilight Zone.
[02:27:42.958 --> 02:28:08.419]  Oh, it was, yeah, the police have radar to look through your walls to keep you safe, and then I thought that was bad enough, and they cut to, oh, there's a group in California, but it's not a weapon, but it'll break your eardrums, and it'll make you submit, and it'll keep her safe, and by the way, domestic police want to use this, and it was just on and on, and so the whole general public, and then I listened to The Simpsons without
[02:28:10.464 --> 02:28:17.426]  Without video, just the audio, and it was so dirty and violent and really R-rated.
[02:28:17.446 --> 02:28:23.508]  You know, all these sexual comments, all these deviant comments, all these on and on and on.
[02:28:23.528 --> 02:28:24.728]  A lot of you like The Simpsons.
[02:28:24.768 --> 02:28:28.549]  The point is, is that it just permeates.
[02:28:29.109 --> 02:28:31.210]  We're becoming a wicked population.
[02:28:31.230 --> 02:28:32.470]  We're becoming an evil population.
[02:28:32.770 --> 02:28:34.331]  So our police are going to become evil too.
[02:28:35.177 --> 02:28:36.879]  HW in Colorado.
[02:28:36.939 --> 02:28:37.779]  HW, go ahead.
[02:28:38.100 --> 02:28:42.703]  Alex, let me go back in time a little to 55 after Hitler in Germany.
[02:28:42.804 --> 02:28:53.052]  I just crossed the street there and I just read the slogan, Die Polizei, dein Freund und Helfer, which means the police, your friend and helper.
[02:28:53.392 --> 02:29:03.361]  Well, I didn't believe it already then for the rest of my life because I got charged for walking across a red light without any traffic around, it was early in the morning or so.
[02:29:04.159 --> 02:29:17.126]  Anyway, then I could tell you more stories until 93, where my 82-year-old mother got body searched by the INS people at the flight from Washington to Germany.
[02:29:18.947 --> 02:29:20.448]  Well, they fumbled her and me.
[02:29:20.468 --> 02:29:22.189]  I don't know why.
[02:29:22.789 --> 02:29:30.493]  But I mentioned to you on your program before that governments, by definition, are only thieves and liars and murderers.
[02:29:30.613 --> 02:29:33.355]  Under government, they only employ these type of minds
[02:29:36.545 --> 02:29:39.533]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:40.455 --> 02:29:43.141]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:46.647 --> 02:29:51.872]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:29:52.032 --> 02:30:00.121]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:30:00.381 --> 02:30:07.428]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:30:08.369 --> 02:30:14.853]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:30:15.053 --> 02:30:20.137]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:30:20.257 --> 02:30:29.143]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[02:30:29.403 --> 02:30:32.706]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:30:48.914 --> 02:30:51.876]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:30:52.096 --> 02:30:55.538]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:30:55.758 --> 02:31:03.923]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[02:32:47.240 --> 02:32:52.342]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:32:53.062 --> 02:32:55.423]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:32:57.864 --> 02:32:58.885]  Alright, we'll let H.W.
[02:32:58.925 --> 02:33:03.386]  finish up and then I'm going to go to the news and talk to Laura and Chad and others before the broadcast ends.
[02:33:04.347 --> 02:33:06.848]  H.W., go ahead and finish up what you were saying.
[02:33:07.108 --> 02:33:12.870]  Yeah, did you get it that our government is by definition crooked, only thieves, liars and murderers?
[02:33:13.630 --> 02:33:17.813]  Well, let me stop you.
[02:33:17.873 --> 02:33:23.576]  That's what the Founding Fathers said, but FEMA teaches the police now that the Founding Fathers were bad.
[02:33:23.636 --> 02:33:25.397]  I have that on video in Road to Tyranny.
[02:33:26.164 --> 02:33:29.106]  And so, the founding fathers were bad, and you're bad too.
[02:33:29.126 --> 02:33:30.907]  The government's good.
[02:33:31.347 --> 02:33:33.148]  Nero and Hitler are good.
[02:33:33.268 --> 02:33:34.309]  Shut up.
[02:33:34.489 --> 02:33:36.490]  Man, I have been through Hitler.
[02:33:36.630 --> 02:33:37.911]  All my family suffered.
[02:33:37.991 --> 02:33:43.895]  My dad was working for the Wehrmacht, and he was in jail under Hitler because he was fighting for the right thing.
[02:33:44.699 --> 02:33:44.939]  I don't
[02:34:03.474 --> 02:34:07.496]  So, sweep out these murderers and cheaters there.
[02:34:07.976 --> 02:34:08.397]  I hear you.
[02:34:08.437 --> 02:34:09.957]  Thanks for the call, H.W.
[02:34:10.418 --> 02:34:10.838]  I hear you.
[02:34:10.878 --> 02:34:15.000]  I'm glad we've woken you up to the fact that the Second Amendment is good.
[02:34:17.421 --> 02:34:17.942]  Oh, boy!
[02:34:18.362 --> 02:34:21.023]  Well, you know, that's how the Founding Fathers talked, but they're bad.
[02:34:21.203 --> 02:34:24.485]  So, again, the people running things today are right.
[02:34:24.525 --> 02:34:25.525]  We should get rid of our freedoms.
[02:34:25.886 --> 02:34:26.686]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:34:28.090 --> 02:34:29.070]  Let me go back into this.
[02:34:29.090 --> 02:34:31.511]  Let me just blitz through the news as quickly as possible.
[02:34:31.551 --> 02:34:33.972]  This is on PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:34:34.552 --> 02:34:37.673]  PrisonPlanet.TV right now from Counterpunch.
[02:34:37.713 --> 02:34:51.338]  And we've added the bill to it and our own analysis as well at InfoWars.com Patriot Act enhancement provides a death penalty for any federal crime punishable by over one year in jail.
[02:34:53.059 --> 02:34:56.640]  And then it gets into the actual subsection of the bill.
[02:34:57.891 --> 02:35:04.041]  And even the ACLU, the liberal ACLU, has to admit that the proposed legislation would do two things.
[02:35:04.081 --> 02:35:07.607]  First, it would make 23 crimes eligible for the death penalty.
[02:35:07.988 --> 02:35:11.654]  That's over a million federal crimes that are over one year in jail.
[02:35:12.702 --> 02:35:13.803]  Yes, there's over a million laws.
[02:35:14.324 --> 02:35:27.619]  Second, it would create an unprecedented catch-all death penalty for any other federal crime punishable by more than a year in prison if it meets the Patriot Act's overboard definition of terrorism and results in death.
[02:35:28.723 --> 02:35:45.480]  The ACLU said that protesters and activists from groups such as including Greenpeace and Operation Rescue would risk being sentenced to death for participating in certain civil disobedience events if they involved a federal crime punishable by more than a year in prison.
[02:35:48.044 --> 02:35:49.164]  And it goes on and on.
[02:35:49.224 --> 02:35:57.346]  It says, laws such as the Freedom of Access to Clinics, Entrances Act, and Federal Gun Control Regime, Title 18 U.S.C.
[02:35:57.386 --> 02:36:03.227]  Section 922, among other crimes, could carry death sentences if the bill passes, Edgar said.
[02:36:04.928 --> 02:36:06.148]  And, uh, it goes on.
[02:36:07.868 --> 02:36:10.089]  So, that's what's, uh, that's what's happening.
[02:36:10.109 --> 02:36:16.390]  Testifying at the June 21st hearing before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security.
[02:36:17.788 --> 02:36:24.974]  They reminded the committee that members of the Justice Department had not been forthcoming in its disclosures regarding how the Patriot Act has been used so far.
[02:36:25.474 --> 02:36:26.515]  That's not really true.
[02:36:26.635 --> 02:36:39.125]  In 2003, they had testimony before Congress where the spokesman for the Justice Department said that we're going to use it against all criminals, all crimes.
[02:36:39.185 --> 02:36:43.989]  And they've used it against topless bars, county commissioners, pot dealers.
[02:36:44.069 --> 02:36:45.110]  It's been all over the news.
[02:36:46.690 --> 02:36:47.851]  So very, very serious.
[02:36:48.131 --> 02:36:50.592]  And the bill is H.R.
[02:36:50.612 --> 02:36:55.014]  2934, the Terrorist Penalties Enhancement Act.
[02:36:58.375 --> 02:37:06.439]  There's a lot of neocon liars in talk radio saying that they found weapons of mass destruction in that Baghdad building that blew up.
[02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:10.561]  First they were there saying it was a bomb factory.
[02:37:10.621 --> 02:37:12.282]  Now they're saying it might have been chemical weapons.
[02:37:12.322 --> 02:37:15.483]  No evidence, but they're claiming weapons of mass destruction found.
[02:37:16.081 --> 02:37:17.703]  How many times have they lied about that?
[02:37:17.723 --> 02:37:20.046]  It's time to bring our troops home.
[02:37:20.066 --> 02:37:21.968]  By the way, John Kerry says he won't do that.
[02:37:22.008 --> 02:37:22.509]  Of course!
[02:37:23.190 --> 02:37:32.060]  Bill Clinton's for the war, Hillary's for the war, Chuckie Schumer, Tony Blair the Socialist, and George W. You're real conservative folks who are for this war.
[02:37:32.921 --> 02:37:35.104]  Of course, Congressman Ron Paul's against the war.
[02:37:35.934 --> 02:37:38.015]  He's got the most conservative voting record in Congress.
[02:37:38.455 --> 02:37:44.038]  Of course, Mel Gibson's against the war, and he's the most conservative and best filmmaker in Hollywood.
[02:37:44.598 --> 02:37:49.220]  But the liberals and the conservatives want to act like it's a left-right debate, and it's not.
[02:37:51.561 --> 02:37:53.842]  Fallujah scene of intense gun battles.
[02:37:54.002 --> 02:37:54.122]  U.S.
[02:37:54.142 --> 02:38:01.586]  Marines backed by helicopter gunships and fighter jets engaged in a raging firefight Monday with insurgents in Fallujah stronghold resistance.
[02:38:02.327 --> 02:38:04.089]  And a part of a mosque got blown up.
[02:38:04.109 --> 02:38:06.171]  That's only going to intensify things.
[02:38:06.992 --> 02:38:09.655]  Twelve American Marines executed in Fuljala.
[02:38:09.695 --> 02:38:10.495]  News cover-up.
[02:38:10.656 --> 02:38:11.697]  Pre-Arab voice.
[02:38:11.717 --> 02:38:19.725]  And it says Fallujah exploded Monday morning, prompting hours of fighting in the northern district of Jolan, when a U.S.
[02:38:19.745 --> 02:38:24.670]  military patrol fired on civilians returning to their homes under the terms of the ceasefire agreement.
[02:38:25.316 --> 02:38:25.516]  U.S.
[02:38:25.536 --> 02:38:37.367]  snipers had taken up position on adjacent buildings by the time Iraq resistance fighters arrived at the scene of the carnage that killed several women and children at approximately 11 a.m.
[02:38:37.587 --> 02:38:41.991]  What followed was a fierce battle that left 12 American soldiers and several others wounded.
[02:38:43.011 --> 02:38:48.516]  According to tales, the Renisi Brigade, an Iraq resistance group,
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:54.683]  Goes on, managed to surround a small unit of U.S.
[02:38:54.723 --> 02:38:56.064]  soldiers, taking them captive.
[02:38:56.405 --> 02:39:03.011]  They took the 12th of the roof of a nearby building and systematically shot them, throwing the bodies from the rooftop to the ground below.
[02:39:03.031 --> 02:39:03.071]  U.S.
[02:39:03.111 --> 02:39:11.339]  Marines fired 81mm mortars on the building to prevent resistance fighters from leaving, however, and they managed to escape without incident.
[02:39:11.579 --> 02:39:16.123]  Eventually, Cobra helicopters and AC-130 Spectre gunships leveled the building.
[02:39:16.878 --> 02:39:16.978]  U.S.
[02:39:17.018 --> 02:39:20.301]  military sources have so far reportedly only one U.S.
[02:39:20.341 --> 02:39:22.082]  Marine dead and eight others wounded.
[02:39:24.644 --> 02:39:25.144]  Oh boy.
[02:39:25.825 --> 02:39:28.567]  Israel to destroy Iran nuke plant.
[02:39:28.707 --> 02:39:37.993]  Now we have the articles posted under this one where Israel in their own Israeli newspapers admit has been selling nuclear weapons components to Iran.
[02:39:38.574 --> 02:39:39.054]  Why?
[02:39:39.154 --> 02:39:43.157]  Because it's to escalate things to bring in this new world order.
[02:39:43.217 --> 02:39:45.599]  Just like our government arming North Korea.
[02:39:46.658 --> 02:39:47.759]  This is how the world went daily.
[02:39:48.279 --> 02:39:57.006]  Jerusalem considers pre-emptive strike by summer's end, while Iran announced plans to begin building a heavy water reactor that can produce weapons-grade plutonium.
[02:39:57.726 --> 02:40:03.430]  Why can't Iran have it, if Pakistan can, with Israel helping arm them with a bridge in the U.S.
[02:40:03.470 --> 02:40:03.710]  too?
[02:40:04.371 --> 02:40:06.012]  Who then arms North Korea again.
[02:40:06.052 --> 02:40:06.993]  This is all staged.
[02:40:07.433 --> 02:40:14.078]  Israel began drawing up plans to demolish it, much as it destroyed an Iraqi nuclear facility more than a decade ago.
[02:40:15.029 --> 02:40:17.431]  More than a decade, it was 22 years ago.
[02:40:18.091 --> 02:40:24.315]  Sources in Israel say the attack could come before the end of the summer, according to Joseph Farah's G2 bulletin.
[02:40:24.955 --> 02:40:33.901]  While Tehran insists the facility is purely for research, the decision heightens concern about Iran's ability to produce nuclear arms.
[02:40:34.801 --> 02:40:40.665]  A 40 megawatt reactor could produce enough plutonium for a nuclear weapon such as, each year.
[02:40:42.122 --> 02:40:50.605]  While construction is set to begin in June, Iran already had previously announced plans to build its reactor last year for the UN Nuclear Watchdog Agency.
[02:40:51.925 --> 02:40:58.007]  Why can't Iran have one of these if North Korea and Pakistan and if Israel can have 400 nukes?
[02:41:00.648 --> 02:41:01.709]  Very hypocritical!
[02:41:04.630 --> 02:41:06.670]  And again, I'm not on either side in this, folks.
[02:41:06.690 --> 02:41:11.592]  This is tribal warfare going on forever, but Israel is wrong
[02:41:12.307 --> 02:41:13.948]  to try to drag us into these wars.
[02:41:15.810 --> 02:41:17.031]  Major escalation there.
[02:41:17.752 --> 02:41:21.015]  Lawyers try to gag FBI worker over 9-11.
[02:41:21.135 --> 02:41:24.858]  Remember two months ago we helped break the story about Sybil Edmonds?
[02:41:26.039 --> 02:41:39.891]  Tom Flacco was there as a reporter at the Capitol and this FBI translator said, I told the committee months ago about how I was ordered to falsify the transcripts that prove the US government had prior knowledge
[02:41:40.555 --> 02:41:46.516]  She said when she refused, they threatened to arrest her, John Ashcroft personally, and then offered to bribe her.
[02:41:47.676 --> 02:41:49.437]  Well, now they're trying to shut her up again.
[02:41:49.457 --> 02:41:53.058]  The Bush administration will today seek to prevent a former FBI translator.
[02:41:53.458 --> 02:41:54.858]  This is the London Independent, by the way.
[02:41:54.878 --> 02:42:05.320]  We're providing evidence about September 11th intelligence failures to a group of relatives and survivors who have accused international banks and officials of aiding Al Qaeda.
[02:42:05.988 --> 02:42:22.776]  Sybil Edmonds was subpoenaed by a law firm representing more than 500 family members and survivors of the attacks to testify that she had seen information proving there was considerable evidence before September 2001 that Al Qaeda was planning to strike the U.S.
[02:42:23.056 --> 02:42:23.776]  with aircraft.
[02:42:24.156 --> 02:42:27.558]  The lawyers made their demand after reading comments Ms.
[02:42:27.638 --> 02:42:29.479]  Edmonds had made to The Independent.
[02:42:30.157 --> 02:42:30.637]  But the U.S.
[02:42:30.657 --> 02:42:35.779]  Justice Department is seeking to stop her from testifying, citing their rarely-used state secrets privilege.
[02:42:36.059 --> 02:42:40.120]  Today, in a federal court in Washington, senior government lawyers will try to gag Ms.
[02:42:40.200 --> 02:42:47.422]  Edmonds, claiming that the disclosure of her evidence would cause serious damage to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.
[02:42:47.842 --> 02:42:48.043]  Ms.
[02:42:48.163 --> 02:42:59.166]  Edmonds, 33-year-old, who had a top-secret security clearance, claimed this month, it's actually last month, that while working in the FBI's Washington headquarters, she saw aircraft
[02:43:00.149 --> 02:43:02.252]  Uh, uh, months before the strikes.
[02:43:02.452 --> 02:43:07.718]  Again, she saw information proving senior officials knew that Al Qaeda had plans to attack the U.S.
[02:43:07.738 --> 02:43:09.581]  with aircraft months before the strikes.
[02:43:10.121 --> 02:43:17.751]  She has provided sworn testimony to the independent panel appointed by President George Bush, but in secret session, to investigate the circumstances surrounding September 11th.
[02:43:20.195 --> 02:43:20.375]  Ms.
[02:43:20.455 --> 02:43:31.061]  Evans was subpoenaed by the law firm Motley Rises, which represents hundreds of families who are taking civil action against a number of banks and two members of the Saudi royal family for alleged aiding of Al Qaeda.
[02:43:31.542 --> 02:43:36.925]  Her lawyer, Mark Zeid, said last night the FBI wants to shut her up completely.
[02:43:38.208 --> 02:43:42.169]  He said it was ridiculous to claim that everything Ms.
[02:43:42.269 --> 02:43:45.090]  Edmonds knew had national security implications.
[02:43:45.190 --> 02:43:50.372]  Rather, he said, the FBI wanted to silence his client to save its embarrassment.
[02:43:52.272 --> 02:43:53.192]  So, think about this.
[02:43:53.212 --> 02:43:58.974]  They're openly going into court trying to gag her, and she already told the Commission.
[02:43:58.994 --> 02:44:00.214]  See, that's what the Commission's for.
[02:44:00.894 --> 02:44:03.035]  Good people in government want to go blow the whistle.
[02:44:03.075 --> 02:44:04.896]  They go to the Commission in session.
[02:44:05.236 --> 02:44:06.336]  They tell them to shut up.
[02:44:07.159 --> 02:44:09.940]  It's all about the globalists finding out what we know.
[02:44:11.941 --> 02:44:14.263]  This is a big, big deal.
[02:44:15.603 --> 02:44:22.767]  And again, they say this month, because One Independent reported on this weeks after we had Tom Flacco on the broadcast.
[02:44:24.341 --> 02:44:39.850]  And again, he was there with 15 news cameras, over 30 print reporters, right there, in the halls of Congress, and she was handing out the documents, giving testimony, and she said, I'm doing this because the Commission, months ago, said they were going to go public with this, and they haven't.
[02:44:40.311 --> 02:44:41.851]  And they threatened to arrest me.
[02:44:42.772 --> 02:44:47.715]  Just like they threatened to arrest other FBI agents that were being told not to stop Al Qaeda.
[02:44:50.365 --> 02:44:51.086]  Here's another one.
[02:44:51.126 --> 02:44:56.089]  Secret Service investigates teen art project depicting Bush as a devil, WFTV.
[02:44:57.270 --> 02:45:09.598]  The art teacher reported that the student had done an art project of Bush as a devil launching a missile.
[02:45:11.104 --> 02:45:12.104]  Isn't that interesting?
[02:45:12.224 --> 02:45:19.446]  And the drawing by the 15-year-old boy in Michigan, I mean in Washington State, were enough to prompt some questions from the Secret Service.
[02:45:20.006 --> 02:45:25.047]  He was not arrested, but he has been disciplined by the school district.
[02:45:25.067 --> 02:45:28.148]  So, criminalizing dissent.
[02:45:29.948 --> 02:45:31.748]  But the border stays wide open.
[02:45:32.629 --> 02:45:34.149]  Big debate surrounding this.
[02:45:34.269 --> 02:45:38.790]  Bush's seizure answered to his awful press conference performance.
[02:45:40.396 --> 02:45:46.578]  Remember a few weeks ago, Bush was totally incoherent?
[02:45:49.119 --> 02:45:49.759]  Remember that?
[02:45:51.360 --> 02:45:54.741]  Bush in his press conference, they said, what was the biggest mistake he made since 9-11?
[02:45:55.081 --> 02:46:01.604]  He said, uh, I wish you would have given me this in writing, uh, so I could have had it prepared.
[02:46:01.704 --> 02:46:02.784]  Boy, it's tough.
[02:46:02.824 --> 02:46:04.064]  He paused for five seconds.
[02:46:04.765 --> 02:46:05.585]  Man, I tell ya,
[02:46:07.206 --> 02:46:14.291]  You know, I'm just waiting for something to pop in my head, and he's suddenly all gray, got greenish colored skin, stumbles around all the time.
[02:46:14.832 --> 02:46:21.537]  And people that knew him when he was governor, and I did, you know, saw him on television, went to some of his speeches, he didn't act like this.
[02:46:22.477 --> 02:46:31.364]  And remember him falling down, supposedly choking on the pretzel, but bruises on both sides of his head, which really a seizure would do, not falling down.
[02:46:31.384 --> 02:46:34.627]  And he takes meditation twice a day, and
[02:46:35.896 --> 02:46:37.817]  Has all these weird skin splotches.
[02:46:38.957 --> 02:46:40.197]  What's really going on here?
[02:46:41.278 --> 02:46:46.239]  The following material is from a reporter with access to White House and presidential press briefings.
[02:46:46.279 --> 02:46:49.600]  Some of this material has surfaced before, but only in small segments.
[02:46:50.040 --> 02:46:54.821]  If any of this is true and not the product of an unhappy person, we are all in serious trouble.
[02:46:55.401 --> 02:47:01.023]  And again, this is a TBRN Barnes Review who gets these memos that turn out to be accurate in the past.
[02:47:02.021 --> 02:47:05.322]  Vice President Cheney is the de facto President of the United States.
[02:47:05.702 --> 02:47:14.105]  When he arrives at the White House for one of his briefings of the President, all employees are cleared from the West Wing and especially from the Presidential official suites.
[02:47:14.745 --> 02:47:22.587]  Cheney arrives in an escorted armored limousine surrounded by his own personal heavily armed bodyguard and is always shown directly at the President's office.
[02:47:23.188 --> 02:47:25.728]  It is reliably reported by respected
[02:47:28.875 --> 02:47:39.439]  Redacted name that Bush has a thick pad of lined yellow notepad on his desk, placed there by some of the other officials just before the Vice President arrives.
[02:47:40.600 --> 02:47:48.983]  After Cheney's departure, the notes taken by the President are transcribed, redacted, and prepared as talking points for the President.
[02:47:49.663 --> 02:47:51.404]  At some time in the past, according to both
[02:47:52.344 --> 02:47:59.227]  Redacted name and redacted name, the President suffered what one of his aides called a very minor seizure.
[02:47:59.968 --> 02:48:05.030]  And as a result of this, the President has a very difficult time following any unscripted conversations.
[02:48:05.570 --> 02:48:13.034]  For this reason, his staff carefully and aggressively protect the President from unexpected questions that he is not capable of answering.
[02:48:13.980 --> 02:48:15.463]  He's a different person than what he used to be.
[02:48:15.924 --> 02:48:27.144]  The President takes oral medication at least twice a day according to the DACTA because of an unspecified indisposition and the subject is strictly off limits for any casual staff conversation.
[02:48:27.816 --> 02:48:32.858]  At one point during a staff conference, the President stood up and began to speak in an unknown language.
[02:48:32.878 --> 02:48:33.518]  I remember that.
[02:48:33.899 --> 02:48:38.200]  Mr. Roe was able to stop the President and to get him to resume his seat.
[02:48:38.561 --> 02:48:46.564]  It was reported that for a period of time, about 15 minutes after the incident, the President appeared to be somewhat confused and very inarticulate.
[02:48:47.566 --> 02:48:57.790]  White House staff members report that they rarely see President Bush during hours, and that when they do, he is generally accompanied by Mr. Roe, but almost never either looks or speaks to the members of the staff.
[02:48:58.251 --> 02:49:06.454]  He does not appear to recognize many of the staff members, and almost all contact with these individuals are carried out by his close aides, especially Mr. Roe.
[02:49:08.535 --> 02:49:15.218]  And I have to tell you, folks, when you see him in a press conference, he has a little smithering, blithering, gibble, but, God, whoa, I can't talk,
[02:49:15.965 --> 02:49:23.111]  I'll pop in my head, I wish you'd give me this in writing.
[02:49:23.431 --> 02:49:25.093]  I mean, what is going on?
[02:49:26.874 --> 02:49:28.415]  That's not the guy I knew as governor.
[02:49:28.956 --> 02:49:31.658]  I mean, I wouldn't call him the best speaker in the book, but he's pretty good.
[02:49:31.678 --> 02:49:34.460]  I mean, he gave some fiery speeches.
[02:49:34.520 --> 02:49:38.764]  I've seen what, either it's so scripted he can't stay on script, or this is true.
[02:49:41.678 --> 02:49:45.640]  Or I guess you believe the pretzel story with bruises on both sides of his face.
[02:49:46.401 --> 02:49:49.042]  You fall down, one spot gets scraped, or one area.
[02:49:49.463 --> 02:49:50.784]  Not different sides.
[02:49:50.864 --> 02:49:53.805]  You know, one cheek, and then the other cheek, and then the forehead.
[02:49:55.226 --> 02:50:01.230]  I don't know what's going on, but I think there's something to this, and that's on prisonplanet.tv as well.
[02:50:03.274 --> 02:50:08.516]  When we get back, a new Iraq flag meets with disapproval, and it doesn't look like the Israeli flag.
[02:50:08.556 --> 02:50:17.139]  The two baby blue stripes and the baby blue moon on a white background, that meets with disapproval.
[02:50:18.059 --> 02:50:20.920]  But I got a bunch of other news, too.
[02:50:21.500 --> 02:50:22.960]  We haven't even got to yet, so stay with us.
[02:50:22.980 --> 02:50:24.601]  We'll try to jam a few calls in here.
[02:50:25.662 --> 02:50:28.306]  Be sure and go to PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:50:28.326 --> 02:50:30.268]  I'm putting a lot of work into this.
[02:50:30.288 --> 02:50:31.910]  The show is Paul Watson.
[02:50:32.351 --> 02:50:40.361]  Weekly, hour-long video reports, articles, key analysis just for the members, so much more.

[02:50:48.115 --> 02:50:48.456]  I think so.
[02:51:03.357 --> 02:51:03.998]  We're good to go!
[02:51:32.879 --> 02:51:35.960]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:36.120 --> 02:51:42.083]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:45.584 --> 02:51:49.926]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:51:50.106 --> 02:51:54.468]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:51:56.783 --> 02:51:59.065]  Use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:51:59.105 --> 02:52:01.867]  The New World Order can emerge.
[02:52:02.228 --> 02:52:06.451]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:52:06.511 --> 02:52:13.457]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:52:13.577 --> 02:52:15.599]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:52:15.839 --> 02:52:26.247]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:52:26.587 --> 02:52:31.931]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:53:37.475 --> 02:53:41.177]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:53:41.797 --> 02:53:43.658]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:53:53.482 --> 02:54:02.145]  A lot of people are still in denial about all the different draft bills that have been introduced.
[02:54:02.885 --> 02:54:06.367]  The different senators and congressmen on both sides of the aisle that have called for it.
[02:54:07.133 --> 02:54:12.235]  So we dug out the Seattle Post-Intelligencer article from March 13, 2004.
[02:54:12.776 --> 02:54:19.439]  Agency Initiates Steps for Selective Draft.
[02:54:22.380 --> 02:54:26.282]  So, again, there it is, right out in the open.
[02:54:26.362 --> 02:54:35.867]  Congress shows little support for effort to draw skilled Americans, but it says the government is talking first steps towards a targeted military draft of Americans with special skills in computers and foreign languages.
[02:54:37.134 --> 02:54:41.935]  And they've also moved forward with reinstituting the draft boards, you name it.
[02:54:44.055 --> 02:54:48.456]  And we've got all those articles posted, and people are still in denial about this.
[02:54:49.176 --> 02:54:51.397]  Another one here out of the Houston Chronicle.
[02:54:53.057 --> 02:54:54.937]  The question is, are you going to put up with this?
[02:54:55.197 --> 02:54:56.577]  And I certainly hope not.
[02:54:57.418 --> 02:55:03.219]  Also, proposed bill would prohibit smoking in car with child passengers.
[02:55:04.339 --> 02:55:05.099]  Sounds good!
[02:55:06.494 --> 02:55:07.375]  In a perfect world.
[02:55:07.415 --> 02:55:09.396]  But, again, it's a free country.
[02:55:09.416 --> 02:55:15.021]  This will just give the police more of an excuse to ticket you, to arrest you, to get in your car, to get in your life.
[02:55:15.041 --> 02:55:16.002]  I mean, leave us alone!
[02:55:17.523 --> 02:55:26.050]  California lawmakers are considering a bill that would make California the first state in the nation to prohibit smokers from lighting up in a private car when children are present.
[02:55:27.551 --> 02:55:28.952]  So, yeah, that's just...
[02:55:29.825 --> 02:55:37.271]  And meanwhile they want to pass a supplement to the Patriot Act that will have the death penalty for violating their federal laws.
[02:55:37.992 --> 02:55:39.953]  Laura in Virginia, go ahead, welcome.
[02:55:41.254 --> 02:55:41.794]  Hi Alex.
[02:55:42.275 --> 02:55:42.615]  Hello.
[02:55:43.116 --> 02:55:50.781]  I've been listening to your show for quite some time and you said something about a lady that was blind that was 71 years old that got beat up.
[02:55:50.922 --> 02:55:52.303]  I just think that's sickening.
[02:55:52.323 --> 02:55:54.084]  It makes me sick to my stomach.
[02:55:56.006 --> 02:55:57.727]  Me and my husband, you know,
[02:55:58.513 --> 02:56:06.299]  We lived up here, you know, in Virginia, and we had this, uh, I think it was a military aircraft that flew by our building.
[02:56:06.979 --> 02:56:08.540]  Our building's told stories, hi.
[02:56:09.341 --> 02:56:16.186]  And, uh, he flew, like, really low, like, right here by our building, like, twice.
[02:56:17.607 --> 02:56:18.848]  Well, ma'am, that's nothing.
[02:56:18.868 --> 02:56:25.093]  They're having urban warfare training drills to condition you for martial law from West Virginia to Pennsylvania.
[02:56:26.354 --> 02:56:29.396]  Coming up in the next five days, thanks for the call.
[02:56:29.516 --> 02:56:31.196]  Last call, Neil in Texas.
[02:56:31.257 --> 02:56:31.977]  Neil, go ahead.
[02:56:33.478 --> 02:56:34.258]  Hello, Alex Jones.
[02:56:34.578 --> 02:56:34.878]  Yes, sir.
[02:56:35.199 --> 02:56:36.979]  This is quite an honor to be able to speak to you.
[02:56:37.039 --> 02:56:44.863]  I've been following your documentary videos around since you were starting out in the poor parts of Austin, just exposing poor people and getting thrown out of their homes.
[02:56:45.304 --> 02:56:49.266]  But I wanted to comment on one thing, and I wanted to ask you a quick question.
[02:56:50.941 --> 02:56:56.547]  I think, sir, that you've already uncovered so much corruption that it's mind-boggling.
[02:56:56.587 --> 02:57:10.099]  But the one thing that I think that if we could send people, everybody, all the anti-war people that were out in the streets when the war started, plus thousands more, for the depleted uranium.
[02:57:10.509 --> 02:57:20.764]  Sir, if we could get, if you and all the other radio stations, Patriot radio stations could organize... Hey, here's the problem, here's the problem.
[02:57:21.765 --> 02:57:24.349]  Sir, I hear you'll have to call me back tomorrow to talk about this further.
[02:57:24.609 --> 02:57:25.411]  I totally agree with you.
[02:57:26.064 --> 02:57:26.924]  Here's the problem.
[02:57:27.425 --> 02:57:31.086]  The left controls the anti-war movement, and they don't want to march for that.
[02:57:31.526 --> 02:57:32.826]  They want to march for the U.N.
[02:57:32.867 --> 02:57:35.828]  and communism, which is wrong, too.
[02:57:36.428 --> 02:57:43.870]  See, the left is controlled, the right is controlled, and conservatives see the left and go, oh, well, the war must be good if all those socialists are against it.
[02:57:44.311 --> 02:57:47.832]  Whereas in reality, the socialist chieftains all vote for the war.
[02:57:48.772 --> 02:57:53.856]  So you've got to deprogram the so-called peace activist groups first before you can do that.
[02:57:53.896 --> 02:57:54.617]  But I agree with you.
[02:57:54.657 --> 02:57:55.517]  I'm sorry we're out of time.
[02:57:56.118 --> 02:57:58.200]  I'll be back tomorrow 11 to 2 during the day.
[02:57:58.300 --> 02:58:00.061]  Back from 9 to midnight tonight central.
