[00:00:05.721 --> 00:00:06.361]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.022 --> 00:00:08.082]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.803 --> 00:00:09.903]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.563 --> 00:00:11.364]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.124 --> 00:00:13.025]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.045 --> 00:00:17.387]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.867 --> 00:00:21.929]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.384 --> 00:00:35.525]  All right, my friends.
[00:00:36.725 --> 00:00:39.906]  We're live, another live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:40.647 --> 00:00:44.488]  It's already Monday yet again, the seventh day of June, 2004.
[00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:48.209]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:56.973]  Every Monday we're joined by one of our contributors, the webmaster for my websites PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv, Paul Watson.
[00:00:58.408 --> 00:01:08.793]  Of course, we'll be talking about the death of Ronald Reagan, who succumbed to a long, decade-long battle with Alzheimer's.
[00:01:10.294 --> 00:01:21.320]  Then I want to get into the latest developments concerning government prior knowledge and involvement in 9-11, a huge explosion blowing up part of a large Shiite center in Iraq.
[00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.863]  Just a ton of vital news and information for you today, so again, thank you for joining us.
[00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:38.338]  The elder Bush from his home in Kennebunkport, Maine said that Ronald Reagan helped bring in the New World Order.
[00:01:40.198 --> 00:01:48.099]  But when we talk about the New World Order, it supposedly doesn't exist according to a lot of the neocon talk show hosts that are out there.
[00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:50.420]  But these presidents keep talking about it.
[00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.001]  Now there's a lot of evidence that the Bush Cabal tried to assassinate Ronald Reagan
[00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:07.065]  He told the New York Times that he felt fine until he was getting in the car with a Secret Service agent and that he thought the Secret Service agent had accidentally shot him.
[00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:10.887]  Now we know of Yusak Rabin.
[00:02:11.948 --> 00:02:21.574]  We know that it was the Israeli Secret Service that shot him and we've had Jerusalem Post writers on, you know, the doctors on at the hospital.
[00:02:21.594 --> 00:02:24.516]  I mean, that's even been in their major papers.
[00:02:25.117 --> 00:02:27.298]  That's known by most people in Israel.
[00:02:28.257 --> 00:02:38.842]  They had that whole staged event with the bodyguards step back, this guy fires his gun and all of a sudden Rabine gets thrown in the vehicle and gets taken to the hospital and isn't given care.
[00:02:38.862 --> 00:02:44.985]  It's one of the oldest tricks in the books and of course John Hinckley Jr.'
[00:02:44.945 --> 00:02:49.628]  's family was having dinner with the Bushes just days before.
[00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:52.069]  We have the Houston Post article.
[00:02:52.734 --> 00:03:03.401]  The Associated Press articles from way back in 1981 posted on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:03.842 --> 00:03:06.363]  We've been posting articles since Saturday.
[00:03:06.383 --> 00:03:08.305]  You may have to look in the archives.
[00:03:08.325 --> 00:03:10.266]  There's a little calendar there you can click on.
[00:03:11.238 --> 00:03:13.979]  The news from the 6th and the 5th.
[00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:22.643]  What we should do is, and which we are doing, is taking all the articles and posting them in a Ronald Reagan section.
[00:03:24.023 --> 00:03:29.385]  So, and again, the government doubled in size under Ronald Reagan.
[00:03:31.786 --> 00:03:37.729]  I personally think Ronald Reagan is better than John Kerry or George W. Bush.
[00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:40.290]  But let's just be honest about it.
[00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.840]  Ronald Reagan was a actor.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.401]  Ronald Reagan projected a persona.
[00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:52.103]  And that's why he was the most loved president of the last century.
[00:03:52.803 --> 00:03:55.784]  Winning with the biggest landslides in the general election.
[00:03:57.705 --> 00:04:00.366]  I mean, I just love Ronald Reagan.
[00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:03.187]  My whole family just loves Ronald Reagan.
[00:04:04.466 --> 00:04:07.488]  Until, in hindsight, learning more about Ronald Reagan.
[00:04:07.508 --> 00:04:15.191]  In fact, there was that book even written by one of his family members, which they admitted was true, when Ronald Reagan tried to join the Communist Party.
[00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:16.012]  This was admitted.
[00:04:16.052 --> 00:04:17.492]  This was not debated.
[00:04:18.753 --> 00:04:20.074]  And they refused him.
[00:04:21.474 --> 00:04:24.196]  But, I mean, look, you can't blame somebody for what they did when they were young.
[00:04:24.216 --> 00:04:28.438]  I mean, everybody was a communist in Hollywood at that point, if you wanted to go up the ladder.
[00:04:29.758 --> 00:04:32.840]  But John Wayne, though, they never asked John Wayne.
[00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:37.893]  I mean, John Wayne actually did some good stuff.
[00:04:37.933 --> 00:04:43.115]  He was actually anti-New World Order and actually talked the talk and walked the walk.
[00:04:43.956 --> 00:04:48.838]  So, nothing bad to say about John Wayne, who was an actor, but actually was more anti-communist than Reagan.
[00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:51.519]  So, I have mixed feelings about Reagan.
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:58.603]  I have a lot of evidence here, so we'll go over Ronald Reagan and who tried to really have him killed and much more when we get back, so stay with us.
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.834]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary, Exposing the New World.
[00:05:20.006 --> 00:05:20.306]  Irony.
[00:05:20.526 --> 00:05:25.047]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:05:25.267 --> 00:05:32.429]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:33.249]  soil, the U.S.A.
[00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:36.990]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.670]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:46.592]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[00:06:02.443 --> 00:06:03.484]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:06:03.824 --> 00:06:06.606]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:11.030]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.291]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:17.155]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:19.780]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:34.964]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[00:07:00.333 --> 00:07:01.875]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:07:02.035 --> 00:07:03.177]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:07:03.357 --> 00:07:06.762]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:07:06.882 --> 00:07:07.282]  Phenol!
[00:07:07.623 --> 00:07:14.692]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:07:15.233 --> 00:07:19.134]  The FDA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:07:19.234 --> 00:07:19.694]  Fragrance?
[00:07:20.054 --> 00:07:24.816]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:07:24.956 --> 00:07:29.637]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[00:07:29.857 --> 00:07:32.418]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my CalBen shampoo.
[00:07:32.678 --> 00:07:36.099]  Well, like all of the products from the CalBen Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:07:36.239 --> 00:07:39.740]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.

[00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:06.073]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.453 --> 00:08:08.774]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:14.657 --> 00:08:16.018]  Ronald Reagan.
[00:08:18.359 --> 00:08:26.944]  The 40th president re-elected with the greatest landslide margin in the 20th century of any president.
[00:08:27.484 --> 00:08:29.145]  Died, of course, Saturday.
[00:08:31.074 --> 00:08:33.276]  In his home in California.
[00:08:33.296 --> 00:08:40.282]  We're going to go over the relationship between Bush and Ronald Reagan.
[00:08:40.942 --> 00:08:54.393]  I have the news articles where in one of the campaigns for president, when Bush and Reagan were enemies, where Reagan called George
[00:08:55.093 --> 00:09:00.255]  Herbert Walker Bush, a globalist, and talked about his membership in the CFR.
[00:09:00.275 --> 00:09:01.415]  We're going to go over that.
[00:09:01.995 --> 00:09:13.539]  Also, who was really behind the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan back in 1981, and just all the details coming up here.
[00:09:14.119 --> 00:09:17.760]  Also, we'll get into some new 9-11 information, take a lot of your calls.
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:23.082]  We have Paul Watson joining us for his Monday report in the middle of the next hour as well.
[00:09:24.978 --> 00:09:41.166]  But before I dive into the Ronald Reagan information, I just got a call during the break from Captain Joyce Riley, who has her syndicated broadcast via this network, and she's on in the morning from 7 to 10 Central.
[00:09:42.387 --> 00:09:51.391]  She's got a major announcement, and this is really exciting, wait till you hear about it, coming up at the bottom of the hour in about 21 minutes.
[00:09:53.766 --> 00:10:02.032]  So you'll definitely want to stay with us for this huge, very exciting announcement coming up in about twenty minutes.
[00:10:04.193 --> 00:10:20.565]  You know, I thought about this this weekend, and I was on National British Radio over the weekend to give them my analysis, my take on Ronald Reagan, the 40th president who died after a long battle, a decade-long battle.
[00:10:20.585 --> 00:10:21.926]  I mean, he announced that he had
[00:10:23.749 --> 00:10:43.515]  Alzheimer's back in 1994, ten years ago, but he obviously had it before that, so at least a decade, and it's a very painful disease for the family, for the individual that is dying from it, because literally your brain just shuts down until you stop breathing.
[00:10:43.535 --> 00:10:49.317]  You go through the whole process of just losing some of your memories until you become a complete vegetable.
[00:10:50.429 --> 00:10:59.513]  And so, Nancy Reagan said this is a great weight lifted off of her, and I can certainly imagine that, and our heartfelt sadness goes out to the family.
[00:11:01.033 --> 00:11:05.875]  Nevertheless, we must be honest about Ronald Reagan.
[00:11:07.255 --> 00:11:13.878]  Now, I don't hate Ronald Reagan like I hate Bill Clinton, like I really hate George W. Bush,
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.281]  I can't stand John Forbes Cherry.
[00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:24.305]  I don't think that Ronald Reagan was an evil person, but he certainly was a puppet.
[00:11:25.525 --> 00:11:41.313]  Now, he was a perfect president because he was an actor, played military officers, was one of his favorite roles in film, and Ronald Reagan, it is admitted, tried to join the Communist Party and was refused.
[00:11:42.108 --> 00:11:44.810]  That didn't work out for him, so then he became a conservative.
[00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:47.651]  And this is all admitted, my friends.
[00:11:48.812 --> 00:11:55.035]  Ronald Reagan was a member of the Bohemian Grove, though he was the type of member like Mr. Nixon was.
[00:11:55.556 --> 00:12:02.960]  They didn't like the Bohemian Grove, so they didn't enjoy the Bohemian Grove, but had to go because of political connections they made there.
[00:12:04.446 --> 00:12:15.816]  In fact, a few months ago, the Presidential Library of Richard Nixon released a tape of him talking about the Grove, how it is the most horrible homosexual orgy you can imagine.
[00:12:17.117 --> 00:12:19.499]  Now again, these are just the facts.
[00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:20.580]  These aren't my words.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:30.388]  These are the words of Richard Milhouse Nixon, and we have a photo on the website released by the Grove of
[00:12:31.508 --> 00:12:39.693]  George Shultz, Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, and others together at the Grove.
[00:12:41.114 --> 00:12:44.156]  We have photos of George Bush and his son at the Grove.
[00:12:44.196 --> 00:12:48.239]  We have Sacramento Bee, Associated Press articles with them at the Grove.
[00:12:49.159 --> 00:12:50.440]  And I snuck into the Grove
[00:12:51.172 --> 00:13:02.863]  In July of 2000, just about a month short now of the four year anniversary and I got the first ever footage from outside the Grove and about a year later the first ever footage of Skull and Bones got out.
[00:13:02.883 --> 00:13:09.890]  The New York Observer got some footage of part of the ritual that goes on in the courtyard and they were hailing Satan and doing mock sacrifices.
[00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.391]  I mean we need to discuss this.
[00:13:11.972 --> 00:13:14.194]  I would hope that if I was out hailing Satan and
[00:13:15.037 --> 00:13:27.000]  You know, doing mock sacrifices that my neighbors would probably call the police on me if I was doing this in my backyard, but our presidents do it, namely our Christian conservative presidents, and we're supposed to just say, oh, they're just having some fun.
[00:13:28.781 --> 00:13:30.921]  Now, in the 1976 election,
[00:13:39.105 --> 00:13:53.440]  uh... we we we see uh... news coming out concerning the bushes and and and and and and and globalism and then in the primaries when when when reagan and bush were battling with each other uh... in nineteen eighty
[00:13:55.106 --> 00:13:59.747]  When they were fighting over, actually in 1979, who would get the nomination.
[00:13:59.787 --> 00:14:01.307]  It was in Florida newspapers.
[00:14:01.927 --> 00:14:05.268]  Reagan out campaigning against Bush, saying, look, I'm not a globalist.
[00:14:05.768 --> 00:14:07.188]  I'm not for this new world order.
[00:14:07.608 --> 00:14:10.169]  I'm not a member on the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:12.549]  And George Herbert Walker Bush is.
[00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:15.130]  And the two did not like each other.
[00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.550]  Now, this is part of the mainstream record.
[00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.231]  Reagan saw Bush as the liberal.
[00:14:23.132 --> 00:14:26.455]  And you notice Reagan never popped off about a New World Order.
[00:14:26.555 --> 00:14:33.000]  George W., or George Herbert Walker Bush, the father of George W. Bush, certainly did.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:49.392]  And then in 1981, just three months after John Lennon gets shot, and that was definitely a government op, and we've gone over the evidence of that, Ronald Reagan gets shot, and he told the New York Times that he thought the Secret Service had accidentally shot him.
[00:14:50.073 --> 00:14:52.755]  He was fine until he got in the car and it felt like a hammer hit him.
[00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:57.850]  And then you have Hinckley Jr.
[00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:02.111]  meeting with the Bushes and being some of their biggest campaign contributors.
[00:15:02.171 --> 00:15:12.573]  Now, we've had LBJ's private lawyer on this show going over the evidence of LBJ and the hit against JFK.
[00:15:12.653 --> 00:15:14.273]  And that's mainstream news now.
[00:15:14.293 --> 00:15:20.775]  I mean, it goes back to Kings, where the younger brother of the king would kill the king so he could be the king.
[00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:23.395]  You know, it goes back to Cain and Abel.
[00:15:24.375 --> 00:15:53.582]  uh... this is uh... this is how it works uh... this is classic vice presidents trying to kill uh... the president and so we'll go over some of the evidence uh... of that as well that's all out of the houston post the the new york times the associated press and we're supposed to forget about all of this and ronald reagan was not senile was quite intelligent until we got to the hospital given the cold blood
[00:15:54.321 --> 00:16:01.288]  And then it was like he was drugged after that and would not be able to hold cabinet meetings and suddenly he would be back to normal.
[00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:15.163]  At that point, the course of the Reagan administration that was going to be small government, he was talking about getting rid of the IRS, suddenly it all changed course and the Vice El Presidente
[00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.011]  Again, I personally like Ronald Reagan.
[00:16:18.031 --> 00:16:18.571]  He's a good actor.
[00:16:31.747 --> 00:16:38.012]  And I personally think he's a lot better than George Herbert Walker Bush, or his son, or John Kerry, or any of them.
[00:16:38.052 --> 00:16:42.515]  But we still have to look at the fact that the government did double in size, folks.
[00:16:43.416 --> 00:16:44.777]  The government didn't get smaller.
[00:16:45.357 --> 00:16:46.718]  It's like George W. Bush.
[00:16:46.818 --> 00:16:48.580]  The government's exploding in size.
[00:16:49.661 --> 00:16:52.282]  But the average person has no idea that's even going on.
[00:16:52.823 --> 00:16:55.065]  Elder Bush recalls man of principles.
[00:16:55.105 --> 00:16:58.127]  This was out of the Maine Today, the Press Herald.
[00:16:59.828 --> 00:17:04.911]  And Bush, from his home in Kennebunkport, Maine, Saturday night was interviewed.
[00:17:04.931 --> 00:17:06.291]  It was published Sunday.
[00:17:06.311 --> 00:17:11.174]  This is on PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and Infowars.com.
[00:17:12.634 --> 00:17:26.421]  And he said, this is a quote, some of the liberals in New York were wringing their hands and going crazy, Bush said, and sure enough, a lot happened on his watch that was very, very positive towards a new world order.
[00:17:29.125 --> 00:17:32.728]  So see, now you're a liberal if you're against the New World Order.
[00:17:32.768 --> 00:17:35.371]  Well, funny, all I hear the liberals calling for is a New World Order.
[00:17:37.053 --> 00:17:39.995]  Fuck, this weekend, yesterday, I was eating dinner with my wife.
[00:17:40.036 --> 00:17:41.257]  We had NPR on.
[00:17:41.937 --> 00:17:48.624]  They were talking about the global banks, the IMF, the World Bank, this global dictatorship, and they said, oh, we've got to stop the evil corporations.
[00:17:48.644 --> 00:17:50.366]  We've got to have a global government to counter it.
[00:17:51.562 --> 00:18:00.647]  The evil corporations that are crime syndicates that aren't free market are creating the New World Order, and the left is telling you, jump into the arms of the New World Order!
[00:18:00.867 --> 00:18:02.709]  They'll save you from the New World Order.
[00:18:04.189 --> 00:18:06.891]  And then Bush does the same thing, but the other side of the equation.
[00:18:07.511 --> 00:18:10.593]  Oh, if you're not for a New World Order, you're with those liberals.
[00:18:11.954 --> 00:18:13.515]  Hitler talked about a New World Order.
[00:18:13.695 --> 00:18:14.015]  H.G.
[00:18:14.075 --> 00:18:15.356]  Wells talked about a New World Order.
[00:18:15.696 --> 00:18:16.777]  Stalin talked about it.
[00:18:16.837 --> 00:18:17.597]  Mao talked about it.
[00:18:17.677 --> 00:18:20.519]  It means global dictatorship, boys and girls.
[00:18:24.057 --> 00:18:25.638]  I mean, this is scary stuff.
[00:18:26.318 --> 00:18:28.699]  But again, Limbaugh says it doesn't exist.
[00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:30.400]  There is no such thing as it.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:34.382]  Here's Bush spouting off, again, about a New World Order.
[00:18:35.543 --> 00:18:39.044]  So, saying that Ronald Reagan helped bring in this New World Order.
[00:18:39.484 --> 00:18:40.645]  Now let me get into this article.
[00:18:40.685 --> 00:18:44.647]  It's kind of a compilation of news articles and stuff from Liberty Think.
[00:18:44.707 --> 00:18:46.408]  It's on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:18:46.428 --> 00:18:49.029]  Reagan dead 23 years after hit by Bush cabal.
[00:18:52.429 --> 00:19:01.311]  Ronald Reagan, the optimistic, patriotic, Hollywood actor, who, as the nation's 40th president, revived the conservative movement in America, died Saturday.
[00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:07.373]  Reagan, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1994, died at his Los Angeles home in Bel Air.
[00:19:07.693 --> 00:19:08.993]  He was 93 also.
[00:19:09.013 --> 00:19:19.376]  He devalued the idea of a strong central government, but the central government got bigger, folks, to the chagrin of the detractors and to the delight of his supporters.
[00:19:20.189 --> 00:19:25.814]  After he was shot two months into his presidency, he told his wife, Nancy, honey, I forgot to dunk.
[00:19:26.474 --> 00:19:33.960]  Goldwater's Administrative Director, Tom Delaney, now we're continuing, was an insider at the 1908 GOP Convention.
[00:19:37.463 --> 00:19:40.906]  Excuse me, 1980.
[00:19:40.946 --> 00:19:41.927]  1908 Convention.
[00:19:41.967 --> 00:19:47.411]  I always remember the very words of Tom... We'll come back and I'll read this article.
[00:19:47.431 --> 00:19:49.393]  We'll go over some of the tidbits.
[00:19:50.638 --> 00:19:55.187]  Basically, this has condensed a lot of the stories we've got posted there, so you can read them all in their entirety.
[00:19:55.828 --> 00:19:58.975]  And we'll get into who really tried to assassinate Ronald Reagan.
[00:19:58.995 --> 00:19:59.416]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.184 --> 00:20:02.785]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.

[00:21:06.415 --> 00:21:08.556]  I would definitely recommend Vim and Vigor.
[00:21:09.076 --> 00:21:13.677]  As far as losing weight, Vim and Vigor is the best investment I ever made.
[00:21:13.997 --> 00:21:15.378]  It actually works.

[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.141]  I have never experienced anything like Collagenate.
[00:21:23.521 --> 00:21:27.142]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than 8 weeks.
[00:21:27.569 --> 00:21:28.190]  It truly works.
[00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:29.732]  Collagenate is wonderful.

[00:22:01.175 --> 00:22:05.898]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[00:22:06.118 --> 00:22:09.560]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.241]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[00:22:12.481 --> 00:22:21.106]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[00:22:21.446 --> 00:22:27.229]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.

[00:23:01.736 --> 00:23:02.737]  It's finally here!
[00:23:02.877 --> 00:23:03.858]  Spring has arrived!
[00:23:04.058 --> 00:23:07.001]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:23:07.221 --> 00:23:10.684]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:23:10.904 --> 00:23:19.051]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[00:24:02.508 --> 00:24:07.651]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:08.331 --> 00:24:10.633]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:13.348 --> 00:24:17.729]  Alright, I'm going to read through this compilation of articles concerning Ronald Reagan.
[00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:23.951]  And then we will start taking your calls toll-free at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:23.971 --> 00:24:24.051]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:24.071 --> 00:24:26.111]  And it says, Goldwater's Administrative Director Tom
[00:24:37.259 --> 00:24:41.441]  Dunleavy was an insider at the 1980 GOP convention.
[00:24:41.922 --> 00:24:48.945]  I always remember the very words of Tom following my protest of the selection of George Bush for VP.
[00:24:49.526 --> 00:24:50.787]  They were etched into my mind.
[00:24:51.027 --> 00:24:52.447]  We didn't like that either.
[00:24:52.868 --> 00:24:54.168]  It was a deal with the devil.
[00:24:54.589 --> 00:25:04.294]  Henry Kissinger and Gerald Ford, present at the convention as agents of David Rockefeller, assured Reagan that his presidency if he accepted Bush on the ticket.
[00:25:05.066 --> 00:25:08.567]  Otherwise, Rockefeller would swing the election to Carter.
[00:25:09.508 --> 00:25:23.894]  Leon Skousen spoke with Reagan at the convention, both before and after the Bush decision, and related how Reagan told how Henry Kissinger and Ford, with the support of Walter Cronkite, another Bohemian Grove member, coerced him.
[00:25:24.334 --> 00:25:27.235]  According to Skousen, these were Reagan's very words.
[00:25:27.395 --> 00:25:32.417]  They showed me the brush by which I would be tarred if I did not go along.
[00:25:33.243 --> 00:25:45.571]  After the election with George W. Bush's top man campaign manager, James Baker, became Reagan's Chief of Staff, the one person who controlled, who saw, the President, the betrayal of conservatism was complete.
[00:25:46.291 --> 00:25:56.277]  After Reagan was allegedly shot by John Hinckley Jr., barely two months into his first term, the curious item turns up in the Associated Press, March 31st, 1981.
[00:25:56.317 --> 00:25:57.678]  This is from the Associated Press.
[00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:13.676]  Scott Hinckley, brother of John W. Hinckley Jr., who allegedly shot Reagan, was to have dined tonight in Denver at the home of Neil Bush, one of Vice President's sons.
[00:26:14.436 --> 00:26:21.539]  Scott Hinckley, Vice President of the father's Denver-based firm, Vanderhilt Energy Corp.
[00:26:21.919 --> 00:26:27.342]  Neil Bush lives in Denver, where he works for the energy company.
[00:26:28.567 --> 00:26:32.449]  A section of Standard Oil Company of Indiana.
[00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:36.731]  And again, there was another meeting before the shooting with the Bushes.
[00:26:36.871 --> 00:26:37.712]  Multiple meetings.
[00:26:37.752 --> 00:26:46.276]  In 1978, Neal served as campaign manager for his brother, George W. Bush, the Vice President's oldest son, who made an unsuccessful bid for Congress.
[00:26:46.316 --> 00:26:50.778]  Neal lived in Lubbock throughout much of 1978, where John Hinckley lived from 1974 to 1980.
[00:26:54.176 --> 00:26:54.656]  Incredible.
[00:26:54.997 --> 00:27:03.644]  Sharon Bush, Neal's wife, said, from what I've known and what I've heard, they, the Hinckleys, are a very nice family and have given a lot of money to the Bush campaign.
[00:27:04.324 --> 00:27:20.497]  We also see that George W. Bush, who was just as honest and straightforward a man in 81 as he is today, U.P.I., March 31, 1981, another of the Vice President's sons, George W. Bush, lived in Lubbock in 1978 and ran unsuccessfully for Congress.
[00:27:21.149 --> 00:27:22.810]  Police have said John Hinckley Jr.
[00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:26.852]  lived in Lubbock at the time and once attended Texas Tech University.
[00:27:27.412 --> 00:27:30.434]  Young George Bush did not recall meeting the suspect.
[00:27:30.834 --> 00:27:34.616]  It's certainly conceivable that I met him or might have been introduced to him.
[00:27:34.996 --> 00:27:42.260]  He said I don't recognize his face from the brief kind of distorted thing they had on TV and the name doesn't ring any bells.
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:47.283]  No, you're just going to the same, you know, hanging out in the same area as your brother's work for him.
[00:27:47.303 --> 00:27:48.924]  They're some of the biggest campaign contributors.
[00:27:50.231 --> 00:27:56.015]  Researcher John Judge, currently head of the 9-11 Citizen Watch, pulled together threads in November 2000.
[00:27:56.055 --> 00:27:59.878]  In the period when Reagan came in, I believe Bush took over.
[00:28:00.319 --> 00:28:05.803]  He was vice president and rose to power, I believe, on March 31st, 1981, when Reagan was nearly assassinated.
[00:28:06.243 --> 00:28:15.550]  The person placed as the Patsy, not the person that actually shot Reagan, but the person placed as the Patsy in the case was John Hinckley Jr., who's allowed out of jail every week now.
[00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:16.930]  Now to the mental institution.
[00:28:17.311 --> 00:28:19.912]  His family ties were to oil.
[00:28:20.252 --> 00:28:27.255]  Through that oil connection, Neil Bush, George Herbert Walker Bush's son, who worked in oil, knew Scott Hinckley, who also worked in oil.
[00:28:27.335 --> 00:28:32.937]  Neil had been involved with Scott in many oil operations, both working for oil speculation and oil companies.
[00:28:33.557 --> 00:28:37.359]  And then Hinckley Jr., the supposed shooter, living in Lubbock with Lord Bush.
[00:28:38.119 --> 00:28:39.039]  Just like the Bin Ladens.
[00:28:39.059 --> 00:28:40.200]  It's just all accidental.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.341]  The two families lived close to each other.
[00:28:42.381 --> 00:28:44.321]  They knew each other socially and financially.
[00:28:44.882 --> 00:28:45.662]  And of course there's been
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:50.062]  Photos and all that out there of them together, but Bush lies about it.
[00:28:50.402 --> 00:28:58.027]  When the Hinkley Oil Company started to fail in the 60's, Zapata Oil financially bailed out the Hinkley's company, but they don't know them.
[00:28:59.008 --> 00:29:05.331]  It went from being Vanderbilt Oil to Vanderbilt Energy or Vanderbilt Resources in the 1960's after Bush intervened.
[00:29:05.892 --> 00:29:13.216]  The Hinkley's had been running an oil operation with six dead wells, but then they were making several million dollars a year after the Bush bailout.
[00:29:14.105 --> 00:29:24.909]  I always thought this was some sort of money pass front, where they were laundering money through this phony oil operation, but actually operating some type of an intelligence payoff.
[00:29:25.638 --> 00:29:31.960]  The father in the family, John W. Hinckley Sr., was also the president of the board for World Vision.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:42.263]  World Vision is the far right-wing and evangelical missionary operation that does missionary and good work operations in countries where there is political purpose for it to be there.
[00:29:42.883 --> 00:29:47.644]  And that's where the supposed shooter of John Lennon worked.
[00:29:48.224 --> 00:29:49.184]  Oh, we'll be right back.
[00:29:51.725 --> 00:29:52.645]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.126 --> 00:29:54.606]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.636 --> 00:29:58.313]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.468 --> 00:30:04.771]  They began with a civil service to rescue off the hostages you had.
[00:30:05.051 --> 00:30:12.636]  It's headed for war on terror until they are credited for... Senator, not getting all the news that's fit to print due to mainstream press censors?
[00:30:12.877 --> 00:30:16.239]  Then subscribe to America's newspaper, the American Free Press.

[00:30:21.903 --> 00:30:29.109]  The American Free Press supports what the majority of Americans want, like lower taxes, stopping illegal immigration, and ending our meddling in foreign affairs.
[00:30:29.589 --> 00:30:35.753]  The American Free Press supports the American people and now you can become a subscriber to the AFP with an incredible offer.

[00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:04.212]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:31:04.532 --> 00:31:09.454]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.714 --> 00:31:14.056]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.356 --> 00:31:23.279]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.479 --> 00:31:27.101]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.381 --> 00:31:32.409]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.709 --> 00:31:39.460]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:39.941 --> 00:31:40.481]  What about you?
[00:31:41.229 --> 00:31:46.571]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:32:31.708 --> 00:32:35.130]  Or get the deluxe kit that adds barley grass seed and sunflower greens.
[00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:40.293]  The health benefits of wheatgrass are legendary, but perhaps one of the best benefits are the antioxidants.
[00:32:40.573 --> 00:32:43.994]  Research is showing that antioxidants are instrumental in preventing cancer.
[00:32:44.254 --> 00:32:49.216]  At wheatgrasskits.com you'll find the best available price on a huge variety of wheatgrass juicers.

[00:33:06.425 --> 00:33:08.346]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.806 --> 00:33:11.647]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:17.369 --> 00:33:18.729]  Think back, my friends.
[00:33:18.749 --> 00:33:21.330]  We have all these articles posted on the websites.
[00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:33.034]  Three months before Ronald Reagan got shot, John Lennon started actually getting away from his socialist ways and was actually writing songs about the New World Order and the Illuminati.
[00:33:33.094 --> 00:33:34.214]  Oh yes, I own some of them.
[00:33:35.689 --> 00:33:43.452]  Months before Reagan gets shot, this individual walks up and shoots John Lennon.
[00:33:44.432 --> 00:33:50.654]  And, of course, he had been overseas in the CIA front, World Vision, this so-called Christian missionary group.
[00:33:51.214 --> 00:33:52.155]  He'd been working there.
[00:33:52.235 --> 00:33:53.515]  He shows up and shoots Lennon.
[00:33:54.335 --> 00:34:04.379]  And, of course, the Hinkley's, the father of John Hinkley Jr., John W. Hinkley, was the president of the board of World Vision.
[00:34:05.345 --> 00:34:12.627]  At the very same time then that we have his son going three months later and supposedly shooting Ronald Reagan.
[00:34:13.988 --> 00:34:18.449]  And then I have the New York Times quote here where Ronald Reagan thought that the Secret Service had shot him.
[00:34:19.409 --> 00:34:21.310]  We saw the same thing with his chakra beam.
[00:34:22.486 --> 00:34:24.947]  So folks, this is so obvious.
[00:34:25.527 --> 00:34:26.948]  It's every time.
[00:34:27.388 --> 00:34:29.169]  So we'll go over this some more.
[00:34:29.709 --> 00:34:36.672]  Then I want to get into some of the developments we got after Bilderberg Group closed up a few days ago in Italy.
[00:34:36.732 --> 00:34:38.393]  Got some big stories there for you.
[00:34:39.313 --> 00:34:44.475]  Also some new 9-11 prior knowledge information and a lot more on Ronald Reagan.
[00:34:44.495 --> 00:34:45.736]  Now he was forced to take
[00:34:46.934 --> 00:34:57.239]  The former CIA Director of the Global is the Skull & Bones member, as his VP, George Herbert Walker Bush, and we'll take your calls, a lot of your calls on this subject, coming up in just a few minutes.
[00:34:57.779 --> 00:35:05.183]  But before we do that, Captain Joyce Riley, who has her own talk show on this network, has a big announcement to make.
[00:35:05.203 --> 00:35:11.586]  This is pretty exciting, and so we're proud to have her announce it and break the news here on this broadcast.
[00:35:12.066 --> 00:35:13.227]  Joyce, good to have you on with us.
[00:35:13.809 --> 00:35:14.769]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:35:14.809 --> 00:35:19.151]  You understand that this is being recorded by Showtime right now as we speak, correct?
[00:35:19.531 --> 00:35:21.551]  Yeah, that's great, and they're welcome to use it.
[00:35:21.831 --> 00:35:22.132]  Sure.
[00:35:22.212 --> 00:35:23.272]  Okay, we have your permission.
[00:35:23.572 --> 00:35:23.832]  Sure.
[00:35:24.292 --> 00:35:26.573]  We are now embarking on a campaign.
[00:35:27.373 --> 00:35:33.075]  Showtime has a program called The American Candidate at AmericanCandidate.com.
[00:35:33.895 --> 00:35:35.376]  A lot of people applied for this.
[00:35:35.476 --> 00:35:42.938]  Over a thousand people applied for this, and I am very honored to have been picked as one of the ten finalists.
[00:35:43.516 --> 00:35:44.897]  They narrowed it down to 24.
[00:35:44.937 --> 00:35:47.318]  I went out to Los Angeles.
[00:35:48.559 --> 00:35:49.860]  I made it into the finals.
[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:55.463]  And we're going to be having a meeting tomorrow night to announce my campaign in our Kansas City, Kansas.
[00:35:56.164 --> 00:36:01.387]  And the reason I'm calling you Alex, you're the first one to know about this, is because you represent, and I represent,
[00:36:01.946 --> 00:36:08.088]  What all these people around the country have been wanting to have said for so long, and that is, what we're thinking.
[00:36:08.568 --> 00:36:09.469]  What's on our minds.
[00:36:09.549 --> 00:36:11.830]  Why we're not happy with the candidates that we have.
[00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:13.450]  Well, I know what people are thinking right now.
[00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:14.891]  Tell us about the show.
[00:36:14.951 --> 00:36:15.691]  Tell us what it does.
[00:36:15.971 --> 00:36:26.035]  Okay, this is a reality show called American Candidate, in which they pick the ten people to tell this country what their issues are.
[00:36:26.555 --> 00:36:29.976]  And so we go before the people and we can get eliminated
[00:36:30.487 --> 00:36:33.250]  We can, you know, we have to stay in the running.
[00:36:33.811 --> 00:36:37.234]  And we want to be the final American candidate.
[00:36:37.295 --> 00:36:38.576]  Joyce, I bet you're going to win.
[00:36:39.016 --> 00:36:40.598]  Well, Alex, that's very kind of you.
[00:36:40.618 --> 00:36:41.599]  I appreciate that very much.
[00:36:41.619 --> 00:36:46.144]  But let me just say... Well, I can't think of anybody more intelligent or informed, I mean, of these other nine people.
[00:36:46.204 --> 00:36:48.146]  I mean, I bet they can't even hold a candle to you.
[00:36:48.307 --> 00:36:48.907]  Oh, well, thank you.
[00:36:48.927 --> 00:36:49.688]  That's very kind of you.
[00:36:49.708 --> 00:36:51.190]  But there's going to be some very sharp people.
[00:36:51.798 --> 00:36:54.740]  But I want the people to hear what you and I talk about.
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.181]  The issues of the Federal Reserve.
[00:36:56.561 --> 00:36:58.062]  The issues of the Gulf War veterans.
[00:36:58.522 --> 00:37:01.003]  The issues of all of our jobs going overseas.
[00:37:01.063 --> 00:37:03.545]  The borders are wide open in the war on terrorism.
[00:37:03.605 --> 00:37:05.486]  These are the issues we're going to be talking about.
[00:37:05.926 --> 00:37:09.368]  And we're going to have a town hall meeting tomorrow night, Tuesday night.
[00:37:09.948 --> 00:37:14.811]  Anybody within shouting distance of our Kansas City, Kansas, please be here.
[00:37:15.359 --> 00:37:22.880]  Because we're going to have a town hall meeting to announce not only these issues, but announce the opening of this campaign and to find out what the people want.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.161]  So we'd like for... Here's the rule.
[00:37:25.481 --> 00:37:26.501]  Here's what I need you to do.
[00:37:26.521 --> 00:37:36.943]  I need, if anybody's near Ark City, to be here at the American Legion in our Kansas City at 6 p.m.
[00:37:37.203 --> 00:37:38.863]  Tuesday night, tomorrow evening.
[00:37:38.883 --> 00:37:39.483]  6 p.m.
[00:37:39.523 --> 00:37:40.243]  tomorrow evening.
[00:37:41.163 --> 00:37:42.064]  They need to be there by 6.
[00:37:42.504 --> 00:37:43.924]  Dave's going to put on a concert.
[00:37:46.657 --> 00:37:49.019]  Okay, arrive after 6 or before 7.
[00:37:49.479 --> 00:37:51.360]  That's what the time limit is.
[00:37:51.661 --> 00:37:53.342]  After 6, before 7.
[00:37:53.842 --> 00:37:55.063]  They can't come before 6.
[00:37:55.343 --> 00:37:55.463]  Oh, 6.30.
[00:37:55.803 --> 00:37:55.463]  6.30.
[00:37:56.424 --> 00:37:57.264]  Yeah, that's perfect.
[00:37:57.705 --> 00:37:59.065]  Dave will be doing a concert.
[00:37:59.506 --> 00:38:01.807]  We're going to do some of his music before that.
[00:38:02.248 --> 00:38:03.869]  And then we're going to have the town hall meeting.
[00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:07.951]  I'm going to announce my candidacy and we want to find out what the people want in this country.
[00:38:08.091 --> 00:38:10.373]  And obviously this is going to be videotaped by Showtime.
[00:38:10.633 --> 00:38:12.655]  Showtime is here right now as we speak.
[00:38:12.775 --> 00:38:13.775]  It's Showtime!
[00:38:14.196 --> 00:38:16.197]  And Showtime will be there tomorrow night.
[00:38:16.983 --> 00:38:19.424]  So, we're going to do what we can.
[00:38:19.444 --> 00:38:20.785]  We've been given this opportunity.
[00:38:21.425 --> 00:38:36.432]  Finally, somebody has said... And so now, out of these ten people, you're going to be able to present in the show what your listeners, what my listeners, what real, active people who aren't left or right, but just want the truth and just want freedom.
[00:38:36.452 --> 00:38:38.193]  This is a major opportunity.
[00:38:38.373 --> 00:38:39.413]  Very, very exciting.
[00:38:39.433 --> 00:38:42.875]  And that's actually a TV show that I would tune in to watch, Joyce.
[00:38:43.295 --> 00:38:45.456]  It is going to be for the thinking people, believe me.
[00:38:45.636 --> 00:38:49.439]  It's what do these people want and how many people want what they have to offer.
[00:38:49.479 --> 00:38:58.904]  Well, we don't have a real debate going on between the two cousins, the two Skull and Bones members, John Forbes Terry and George W. Bush.
[00:38:59.444 --> 00:39:09.929]  And so people are very hungry for this, and Hollywood knows that, and this is a great opportunity to get the truth out to tens of millions of people, Joyce.
[00:39:09.949 --> 00:39:10.189]  It is.
[00:39:10.369 --> 00:39:16.932]  And Alex, your show is the first one I wanted to call because you and I are so like-minded in what we believe and what our listeners want.
[00:39:17.052 --> 00:39:18.172]  I'm not representing me.
[00:39:18.372 --> 00:39:22.374]  I'm representing all the things our listeners have said for the past five years.
[00:39:22.955 --> 00:39:25.256]  Is we want a chance to make it visible.
[00:39:25.576 --> 00:39:29.317]  We want to talk about what's happened to these vets and how they've been kicked to the side of the curb.
[00:39:29.457 --> 00:39:34.039]  Also need to talk about all the prior knowledge, government prior knowledge of 9-11.
[00:39:34.059 --> 00:39:34.839]  Absolutely.
[00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:42.581]  And how the American people want a real investigation of September 11th, not a bunch of Bush business partners running a giant whitewash.
[00:39:42.741 --> 00:39:43.242]  That's right.
[00:39:43.322 --> 00:39:47.243]  And how the people want to be the sovereign, not the federal government be the sovereign.
[00:39:47.722 --> 00:39:54.309]  You're going to be talking about how the American people should be the boss and how government isn't our ruler?
[00:39:54.529 --> 00:39:56.691]  You got a hundred on that test, that's exactly right.
[00:39:56.711 --> 00:40:05.019]  We're going to return the government back to the people, to the sovereign citizens that we should have been in the first place, that we were according to the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:40:05.079 --> 00:40:10.605]  So, let me just repeat, I need the assistance of anybody that can be in this area tomorrow night.
[00:40:11.317 --> 00:40:13.538]  Tuesday night at the American Legion.
[00:40:13.579 --> 00:40:20.803]  The address is 113 East Washington Avenue, right in the middle of downtown Arkansas City.
[00:40:20.843 --> 00:40:21.604]  It's not very big.
[00:40:21.644 --> 00:40:22.905]  It's only about four blocks long.
[00:40:22.925 --> 00:40:23.545]  You can find it.
[00:40:24.125 --> 00:40:26.327]  Be there between 6 and 7.
[00:40:26.427 --> 00:40:28.928]  Not before 6, because it doesn't count if they come before 6.
[00:40:29.809 --> 00:40:30.309]  Between 6.
[00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:32.971]  You know, like at 6.15 it would be perfect.
[00:40:33.071 --> 00:40:33.692]  Exactly.
[00:40:33.812 --> 00:40:37.334]  And it's a great way to get your message out, folks, and to support Dave and Joyce.
[00:40:37.958 --> 00:40:49.183]  Well, Joyce, this is exciting, and I wonder if the whole Hollywood crowd is going to want to see a strong woman in there talking about the New World Order and exposing the real issues.
[00:40:49.243 --> 00:41:05.170]  I think that it's going to be very refreshing to have a strong, intelligent woman who wants to defend the people and their liberties instead of these other female and male candidates that are pushed on us that are constantly promoting this globalist agenda.
[00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:06.351]  You got it right.
[00:41:06.451 --> 00:41:09.194]  And it's not important that it's male or female.
[00:41:09.494 --> 00:41:13.437]  I mean, let's just look who the last few guys were that were in there that did all this.
[00:41:13.537 --> 00:41:14.358]  Maybe it's time.
[00:41:14.438 --> 00:41:16.780]  I don't know, but I'm not concerned about male versus female.
[00:41:17.181 --> 00:41:18.642]  I'm concerned about right versus wrong.
[00:41:18.662 --> 00:41:20.884]  Well, you're a lot better than Hillary Clinton, Joyce!
[00:41:21.224 --> 00:41:22.365]  Hey, thanks for that vote.
[00:41:22.706 --> 00:41:31.854]  Hey, listen, just again, everybody, if you are within driving distance, yes, Showtime will be covering this and using it for their production.
[00:41:32.338 --> 00:41:35.899]  But please, everybody, go to AmericanCandidate.com.
[00:41:35.919 --> 00:41:39.021]  Now, I'm not... I don't know if they've got the ten candidates, because they just announced them.
[00:41:39.401 --> 00:41:40.621]  It was in the New York Times.
[00:41:41.141 --> 00:41:42.742]  Everybody's been trying to find out.
[00:41:42.762 --> 00:41:49.044]  This has been written up in the New York Times in the past, but the media's been trying to find out who these ten candidates are from all over the country.
[00:41:49.144 --> 00:41:51.445]  And you're one of the first ones to be able to announce it.
[00:41:51.685 --> 00:41:53.986]  Okay, well, tell us who the candidates are.
[00:41:54.166 --> 00:41:54.566]  I don't know.
[00:41:54.606 --> 00:41:55.767]  They won't let me know either.
[00:41:56.858 --> 00:41:57.238]  I don't know.
[00:41:57.318 --> 00:42:02.001]  All I know is at 10 a.m.
[00:42:02.041 --> 00:42:03.361]  I've got my marching instructions.
[00:42:03.782 --> 00:42:08.404]  I've got to have this town hall rally tomorrow night, Tuesday night at 6.15.
[00:42:08.944 --> 00:42:12.546]  We're going to have a town hall meeting like you've never seen before.
[00:42:12.786 --> 00:42:14.247]  We're going to have Dave playing music.
[00:42:15.006 --> 00:42:17.048]  Anybody that can be here, be here.
[00:42:17.108 --> 00:42:19.509]  We're going to have a big, big meeting, okay?
[00:42:19.529 --> 00:42:25.214]  Okay, Joyce, that is very exciting and I'm sure you will keep us abreast of the situation as it develops.
[00:42:25.414 --> 00:42:31.178]  That's right, and we'll have a recorded program on in the morning because we're not going to be able to continue.
[00:42:31.578 --> 00:42:35.001]  Dave is going to have to be here with me, so that's why we're going to be gone from the show.
[00:42:35.842 --> 00:42:40.345]  We are going to be doing the business that we have asked for all time.
[00:42:43.257 --> 00:42:44.957]  We've been asking for this opportunity.
[00:42:45.037 --> 00:42:46.958]  Now it's been given to us, and we've got to use it.
[00:42:47.198 --> 00:42:47.998]  Very exciting.
[00:42:48.218 --> 00:42:49.398]  Joyce, thank you for joining us.
[00:42:49.498 --> 00:42:55.039]  And thank you for the Genesis Network, because a lot of people are going to want to know who Genesis Network is and Infowars.com.
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:58.280]  And remember, we will not stop, Alex.
[00:42:58.660 --> 00:42:59.140]  All right.
[00:43:00.701 --> 00:43:02.061]  Well, congratulations, Joyce.
[00:43:02.141 --> 00:43:03.681]  Thank you so much for the opportunity, sir.
[00:43:03.721 --> 00:43:04.121]  You bet.
[00:43:04.141 --> 00:43:04.662]  Take care.
[00:43:04.722 --> 00:43:05.422]  All right, folks.
[00:43:05.442 --> 00:43:06.882]  You want to go be involved in that?
[00:43:07.442 --> 00:43:10.503]  A real town hall meeting tomorrow night, 630, in Arkansas.
[00:43:10.563 --> 00:43:10.603]  OK.
[00:43:13.077 --> 00:43:19.099]  I want to get back into Ronald Reagan and his wicked Vice President George Herbert Walker Bush.
[00:43:20.059 --> 00:43:39.185]  I want to get into this bizarre group, World Vision, with one of its little employees going and putting a couple bullet holes in John Lennon, and three months later, the head of the company's son supposedly shoots Ronald Reagan, the 40th president, with a .22 caliber handgun,
[00:43:40.566 --> 00:43:47.453]  We'll be discussing that and going over it, but I want to give you a chance to get involved on air, folks.
[00:43:48.414 --> 00:43:50.856]  So right now, let's go ahead and go to some calls.
[00:43:50.876 --> 00:43:51.656]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:43:51.677 --> 00:43:55.960]  I'm going to give each caller about a minute or two.
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:57.422]  I want to get lots of you in.
[00:43:57.882 --> 00:43:58.923]  Eric in Connecticut.
[00:43:58.963 --> 00:44:00.244]  Eric, first caller, go ahead.
[00:44:02.446 --> 00:44:03.487]  Good to talk to you, Eric.
[00:44:03.527 --> 00:44:03.988]  Are you there?
[00:44:04.008 --> 00:44:06.510]  I guess he's gone.
[00:44:07.313 --> 00:44:09.093]  Alright, Paul in Delaware.
[00:44:09.194 --> 00:44:10.154]  Paul, you're on the air.
[00:44:10.194 --> 00:44:10.654]  Go ahead.
[00:44:11.014 --> 00:44:12.474]  Hey Alex, how you doing, my man?
[00:44:12.634 --> 00:44:12.914]  Good!
[00:44:13.735 --> 00:44:17.896]  Yeah, have you had a chance to see that new Coke commercial with the RFID chip in it?
[00:44:18.496 --> 00:44:24.938]  Yeah, I meant to tell Stephanie to go to PrisonPlanet.tv, my dear, and please download that.
[00:44:24.958 --> 00:44:34.100]  I want to play that audio in the next hour where the Delta Force is chasing you and you can win but you can't hide being tracked is so much fun.
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:37.861]  Yeah, I mean, I'll tell you, I don't know what's going on here, my man.
[00:44:38.941 --> 00:44:52.424]  But, um, as far as Reagan goes, I just thought when he got shot, I was just thinking to myself back then, before I was even a really a thinking person, I was thinking, maybe George Bush has gotten this man shot because he wants to take total control.
[00:44:52.804 --> 00:44:54.064]  Well, just like LBJ!
[00:44:54.084 --> 00:44:56.085]  I mean, that's now admitted by his own lawyer!
[00:44:56.265 --> 00:44:56.685]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:44:57.625 --> 00:45:01.486]  Well, look, I mean, this is the classic MO of the top lieutenant going after the boss,
[00:45:02.545 --> 00:45:06.828]  You know, the Soviets going after Stalin and then putting Khrushchev in.
[00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:09.490]  So it's the same story over and over again.
[00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:30.405]  And Reagan was actually coming out with conservative policies, and then two months into the White House gets shot by the head of the company, whose employee shoots Lenin, and the head of the company's son supposedly then business buddies with the Bushes, business partners with them, then goes and does the dirty work and shoots Reagan.
[00:45:30.905 --> 00:45:35.266]  But then Reagan tells the New York Times, I thought the Secret Service accidentally shot me in the car.
[00:45:35.626 --> 00:45:41.928]  And then he told people at the hospital, and we have the mainstream news articles here, folks, from back in 81, that he thought it was Bush.
[00:45:41.968 --> 00:45:46.510]  And then suddenly he changed his story real quick, and suddenly had trouble thinking as much.
[00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:49.691]  And they said, oh, maybe it was the cold blood he was given.
[00:45:50.211 --> 00:45:51.071]  Yeah.
[00:45:51.311 --> 00:45:52.812]  I was watching C-SPAN.
[00:45:52.832 --> 00:45:56.033]  They were having the Gulf War illness hearings, and I mean, it was really good.
[00:45:56.233 --> 00:46:00.094]  And they switched off of that, and they started talking about Reagan.
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:12.082]  I was thinking to myself, you know, they just want to keep away from the Gulf War, and then I turned on today and you were talking about it, but there are some issues that need to be talked about with Reagan and Bush and what's going on with them.
[00:46:12.702 --> 00:46:16.363]  But, yeah, that's pretty much all I had to say, my man.
[00:46:16.903 --> 00:46:18.003]  All right, good to hear from you.
[00:46:18.023 --> 00:46:20.304]  I appreciate the call, Paul.
[00:46:20.644 --> 00:46:24.005]  Let's go back to Eric up in Skull and Bones country up in Connecticut.
[00:46:24.025 --> 00:46:24.645]  Go ahead, Eric.
[00:46:24.825 --> 00:46:25.845]  Oh, sorry, Alex.
[00:46:25.865 --> 00:46:26.845]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:46:26.905 --> 00:46:27.125]  Sure.
[00:46:27.865 --> 00:46:29.626]  So, Matrix of Evil this weekend.
[00:46:29.806 --> 00:46:30.306]  Nice job.
[00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:31.200]  Well, thank you!
[00:46:31.981 --> 00:46:32.581]  Very well done.
[00:46:32.941 --> 00:46:48.869]  And I think a lot of people will enjoy it and appreciate it because it allows them to sort of see you in the flesh in front of audiences and speaking and referring as you do in your previous videos to your sources.
[00:46:48.969 --> 00:46:52.911]  But this is good because you're right out in front of the public in a public forum.
[00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:54.871]  Yeah, Matrix of Evil.
[00:46:54.911 --> 00:46:58.813]  The others are in kind of Discovery Channel, History Channel, documentary format.
[00:46:59.173 --> 00:47:02.414]  And there's some of that in Matrix of Evil, the two-hour, ten-minute film.
[00:47:03.275 --> 00:47:06.597]  But in Matrix of Evil, it's Ron Paul giving speeches and being interviewed by us.
[00:47:06.617 --> 00:47:15.481]  It's myself, Frank Morales, Colonel Roberts, even a Democrat talking about the New World Order and the UN kidnapping rings.
[00:47:16.341 --> 00:47:16.902]  We interview
[00:47:18.237 --> 00:47:20.958]  The former Georgia Congresswoman, Cynthia McKinney.
[00:47:21.478 --> 00:47:23.879]  It's got speeches like I have on national television.
[00:47:23.959 --> 00:47:26.799]  It's got us throwing the Patriot Act out in Austin.
[00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:28.540]  That was awesome, Alex.
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:32.021]  I wanted to commend you on your speech in front of the Austin Council.
[00:47:34.202 --> 00:47:36.322]  That was really, that was wonderful.
[00:47:37.883 --> 00:47:38.263]  Thank you.
[00:47:38.443 --> 00:47:46.225]  It was good to see it was refreshing, and I'll tell you, the lies that are being put forth about the Patriot Act, about hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of cities
[00:47:47.026 --> 00:47:50.529]  Three or four states now rejecting this piece of garbage.
[00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:52.690]  It was nice.
[00:47:53.311 --> 00:47:53.871]  Well, thank you.
[00:47:53.891 --> 00:47:55.633]  Do you have any comments about Ronald Reagan?
[00:47:55.753 --> 00:47:56.393]  I certainly do.
[00:47:57.394 --> 00:47:59.716]  I think Ronald Reagan started out sincere enough.
[00:48:00.416 --> 00:48:06.581]  I mean, if one was to listen to his 1977 to 1979 radio addresses, which he did like five days a week.
[00:48:06.821 --> 00:48:08.042]  I've heard some of those.
[00:48:08.082 --> 00:48:08.602]  Very good.
[00:48:09.083 --> 00:48:10.724]  In fact, I have most of them on tape.
[00:48:10.904 --> 00:48:11.605]  They're superb.
[00:48:12.165 --> 00:48:14.687]  I mean, one will hear a real conservative
[00:48:15.475 --> 00:48:21.217]  However, in 19, I believe it was March 30, 1981, when the assassination attempt took place.
[00:48:21.237 --> 00:48:23.637]  It was either in 80 or 81.
[00:48:23.697 --> 00:48:25.358]  It was in 81.
[00:48:25.778 --> 00:48:27.178]  81, okay.
[00:48:27.859 --> 00:48:32.100]  He was planning, among other things, to abolish the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:32.680]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:35.761]  I mean, he said not one red cent of the tax money you pay goes.
[00:48:35.781 --> 00:48:37.121]  We're going to abolish the IRS.
[00:48:37.361 --> 00:48:39.142]  We're going to abolish the BATF.
[00:48:39.907 --> 00:48:47.716]  He was doing all this stuff, really was going to cut government, and then suddenly he gets shot by the son of the Bush business partners.
[00:48:47.756 --> 00:48:50.159]  We get attacked by the business partners, the Bin Ladens.
[00:48:50.179 --> 00:48:52.281]  Saddam, the business partner, invades Kuwait.
[00:48:52.321 --> 00:48:55.385]  I mean, it's just the same story over and over again.
[00:48:56.105 --> 00:49:03.055]  And then it's an employee of the Hinkley's company that goes and shoots Lennon three months before.
[00:49:03.075 --> 00:49:05.998]  I mean, how much more obvious does it have to get?
[00:49:06.159 --> 00:49:13.929]  The smoking guns are everywhere, and Alex, I would suggest to your listeners that they check out some of Spritz Springmeier's books.
[00:49:14.922 --> 00:49:18.244]  uh... be wise to serpents of the bloodlines of the Illuminati.
[00:49:18.364 --> 00:49:21.365]  We carry bloodlines of the Illuminati at Infowars.com.
[00:49:21.445 --> 00:49:25.847]  And also he wrote some remarkable information on mind control.
[00:49:26.727 --> 00:49:33.749]  And just a font of knowledge and... You mean the CIA, former CIA Director Bush might have some mind control people working for him?
[00:49:33.769 --> 00:49:34.749]  Can you imagine that?
[00:49:34.829 --> 00:49:37.870]  Oh geez, I'm not being a good neocon or I'd say no he doesn't.
[00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:44.492]  I mean the Hinckley's just magically have their kid out shooting people and just magically have the employee working for him that shoots John Lennon.
[00:49:44.772 --> 00:49:48.513]  Yeah, it's amazing, it's amazingly intricate and complex.
[00:49:49.253 --> 00:49:54.135]  The tools used for these mind control techniques and just how it's done.
[00:49:55.327 --> 00:49:56.008]  Well, it's simple.
[00:49:56.068 --> 00:50:03.836]  They put somebody on PCP and LSD and dunk them in water for a couple months, off and on, until they totally lose their mind and they reprogram them.
[00:50:04.036 --> 00:50:05.337]  That's even on the History Channel.
[00:50:05.377 --> 00:50:15.628]  Dr. Ewing Cameron, the founder of the American Psychological Association, was convicted in civil court of torturing thousands of people under the CIA program.
[00:50:16.268 --> 00:50:17.690]  I mean, this is admitted, folks.
[00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:18.671]  Mainstream news.
[00:50:19.241 --> 00:50:22.804]  Well, look, back during Vietnam, they had our pilots confessing, doing whatever.
[00:50:23.084 --> 00:50:27.188]  During the Korean conflict, they had Manchurian candidates.
[00:50:27.288 --> 00:50:28.349]  This can be done.
[00:50:28.689 --> 00:50:29.650]  This is done.
[00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:30.971]  It's being done.
[00:50:30.991 --> 00:50:32.052]  It's being done today.
[00:50:32.232 --> 00:50:37.276]  And it's certainly being done on the part of these... It's being done to children today.
[00:50:37.416 --> 00:50:46.404]  And it's being done by some very prominent and famous people that the people... Well, look, World Vision is the CIA front in the third world countries.
[00:50:47.583 --> 00:50:51.585]  And it's run by the Hinckleys, who were business partners with the Bushes.
[00:50:51.805 --> 00:50:56.206]  And then this guy works for them and goes and shoots Lennon, and then their son goes and shoots Reagan.
[00:50:56.807 --> 00:50:58.907]  And then Reagan says, no, the Secret Service shot me.
[00:50:58.967 --> 00:50:59.608]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.488 --> 00:51:05.830]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:10.452]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.592 --> 00:51:14.973]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.013 --> 00:51:16.354]  The New World Order.

[00:52:14.141 --> 00:52:18.828]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:19.288 --> 00:52:26.010]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:38.173]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:38.653 --> 00:52:43.118]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:52:43.298 --> 00:52:45.621]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:54:04.139 --> 00:54:10.183]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:10.784 --> 00:54:13.786]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:17.268 --> 00:54:28.276]  I haven't even gotten into the meat and potatoes of Ronald Reagan and the evidence that it was the Bushes carrying out a globalist operation in 1981.
[00:54:30.322 --> 00:54:31.403]  We will get into that.
[00:54:31.503 --> 00:54:44.153]  I do want to get into the latest developments of the Bilderberg groups and some big stories coming out of that meeting that just closed down a few days ago over in Italy and some really important 9-11 information as well.
[00:54:44.734 --> 00:54:45.895]  Taliban told U.S.
[00:54:45.915 --> 00:54:47.476]  it would give up Osama report.
[00:54:48.016 --> 00:54:54.722]  Reuters, this is from yesterday, June 6th, and then of course that dovetails with the article from last week.
[00:54:54.842 --> 00:54:55.062]  U.S.
[00:54:55.102 --> 00:54:57.724]  told Saudis to let al-Qaeda government escapes as official.
[00:54:58.185 --> 00:54:59.806]  That out of the Scotsman.
[00:55:00.839 --> 00:55:03.860]  Just like with Hinckley, or Saddam, or any of these people.
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:05.440]  It's always business partners.
[00:55:06.061 --> 00:55:08.041]  With the Bushes, always staged events.
[00:55:09.582 --> 00:55:10.742]  But we'll continue with this.
[00:55:10.782 --> 00:55:12.382]  We'll go to your calls here in just a moment.
[00:55:12.923 --> 00:55:16.744]  Before I do though, you heard the earlier caller talk about my film, The Matrix of Evil.
[00:55:16.784 --> 00:55:17.644]  It's a great video.
[00:55:17.664 --> 00:55:21.505]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror.
[00:55:21.585 --> 00:55:24.506]  Both those videos cover September 11th, a government sponsored terror.
[00:55:25.706 --> 00:55:27.787]  Carry a bunch of videos, books on tape.
[00:55:28.777 --> 00:55:30.657]  Just a lot of powerful information.
[00:55:30.677 --> 00:55:37.859]  You can watch video clips, read about the films and books, order them online at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.

[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:43.520]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:55:56.702 --> 00:55:58.404]  The videos are all over two hours long.
[00:55:58.644 --> 00:56:00.245]  $25.95 apiece.
[00:56:00.265 --> 00:56:01.346]  $20 if you order three or more.
[00:56:01.947 --> 00:56:04.889]  You can... $20 apiece if you order three or more.
[00:56:04.969 --> 00:56:05.610]  Big discount.
[00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:14.337]  You can also write to me to Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[00:56:17.259 --> 00:56:19.061]  These videos are excellent.
[00:56:19.081 --> 00:56:20.762]  They're great at waking people up.
[00:56:20.802 --> 00:56:21.343]  So get them.
[00:56:21.383 --> 00:56:22.284]  Make copies of them.
[00:56:22.324 --> 00:56:23.665]  Get them out to people today.
[00:56:24.355 --> 00:56:27.998]  Again, that number if you missed it, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:28.018 --> 00:56:36.904]  Or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[00:56:38.725 --> 00:56:42.048]  Let's go ahead and talk to Emmett in Pennsylvania, then Jeff and others.
[00:56:42.108 --> 00:56:43.009]  Go ahead, Emmett.
[00:56:43.769 --> 00:56:47.932]  Yes, last night I was playing Neil Young's Mirror Ball.
[00:56:48.232 --> 00:56:49.573]  You need to hear that disc.
[00:56:50.894 --> 00:56:53.176]  One of the songs goes, Home of the Brave.
[00:56:53.683 --> 00:56:56.005]  Where only heroes need protection.
[00:56:56.025 --> 00:56:59.127]  These rockers, they know what's going on.
[00:56:59.167 --> 00:57:00.388]  They know what's going down.
[00:57:00.408 --> 00:57:06.252]  You know, Reagan tripled the federal deficit while he was in.
[00:57:06.272 --> 00:57:10.495]  He voted OK for abortions in California.
[00:57:11.496 --> 00:57:15.078]  And the way I believe, he was divorced and remarried.
[00:57:15.138 --> 00:57:18.921]  According to the Bible, that's not... You're only married to your first wife.
[00:57:21.286 --> 00:57:27.671]  Well, clearly Reagan was not going to be that big government promoter until he got shot.
[00:57:28.672 --> 00:57:32.254]  And certainly the government radically expanded, doubled in size.
[00:57:32.415 --> 00:57:33.756]  It's now happening under Bush.
[00:57:34.216 --> 00:57:38.239]  And I guess conservative means doubling in size, but he was an actor.
[00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:42.682]  I don't think he was bad, but clearly he was a puppet.
[00:57:43.423 --> 00:57:45.024]  But a lot of people don't want to face this.
[00:57:45.064 --> 00:57:48.027]  It's like Democrats don't want to face the fact that Bill Clinton was who he was.
[00:57:48.907 --> 00:57:50.949]  But clearly they wouldn't have shot him
[00:57:52.041 --> 00:57:57.425]  With the Bush business partner's son, if he hadn't been doing some things I didn't like.
[00:57:58.106 --> 00:57:58.967]  Here's another thing.
[00:57:59.387 --> 00:58:04.250]  It's come out recently that Iraq was trying to buy plutonium from South Africa.
[00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:05.511]  That's not true.
[00:58:05.531 --> 00:58:06.852]  Oh, okay.
[00:58:06.912 --> 00:58:08.874]  I mean, we've had about a hundred of these reports.
[00:58:09.294 --> 00:58:10.095]  Okay, alright.
[00:58:10.435 --> 00:58:12.957]  I was thinking, well, George Bush might have been trying to pull a
[00:58:14.236 --> 00:58:19.700]  Roosevelt, with letting the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor, he left them to bomb the Trade Tower buildings.
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:20.721]  He let them?
[00:58:20.741 --> 00:58:22.923]  The hijackers are still alive?
[00:58:22.943 --> 00:58:23.543]  The whole thing was staged?
[00:58:23.563 --> 00:58:24.064]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:58:24.084 --> 00:58:25.145]  The whole thing, yeah.
[00:58:25.585 --> 00:58:28.767]  Well, we need a real inquiry into that.
[00:58:28.988 --> 00:58:33.471]  Well, look, regardless of who Ronald Reagan really was, it doesn't matter.
[00:58:33.511 --> 00:58:34.372]  They're all puppets.
[00:58:34.933 --> 00:58:35.193]  Right.
[00:58:35.433 --> 00:58:36.274]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[00:58:36.294 --> 00:58:37.074]  Thanks for the call.
[00:58:37.875 --> 00:58:41.398]  We'll come back with the second hour and go to Jeff and Terry and
[00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:45.326]  And Myron and many, many others, toll free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:58:45.346 --> 00:58:45.646]  Stay with us.
[00:58:52.105 --> 00:59:00.008]  Skyrocketing oil prices, the economy on the brink, the plunging dollar, terrorism, the government spending $1.80 for every dollar it collects.
[00:59:00.328 --> 00:59:05.591]  Never in the history of our country have we faced so many threats to our freedoms, rights, and individual security.
[00:59:05.791 --> 00:59:08.372]  How long can we continue without a fracture occurring?
[00:59:08.512 --> 00:59:13.554]  With the events that recently rocked the elections in Spain, what will happen as we get closer to our own election?
[00:59:14.134 --> 00:59:16.616]  Now is the time to begin preparing for such threats.
[00:59:16.916 --> 00:59:21.659]  Ready Reserve Foods has been helping businesses, government, and individuals for over 32 years.
[00:59:21.919 --> 00:59:31.786]  No matter what your preparation needs, Ready Reserve Foods offers virtually the finest in dehydrated, nitrogen-packed, long-term storable foods and has food units to fit your particular needs.
[00:59:32.166 --> 00:59:32.567]  Big Brother.
[00:59:59.059 --> 01:00:00.120]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:01.941]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.601 --> 01:00:03.401]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.162 --> 01:00:06.103]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:06.123 --> 01:00:09.384]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.905 --> 01:00:14.027]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:17.409 --> 01:00:18.509]  Welcome, my friends.
[01:00:18.629 --> 01:00:21.691]  It is Monday, the seventh day of June 2004.
[01:00:22.511 --> 01:00:23.532]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:00:26.658 --> 01:00:31.980]  Paul Watson, for his Monday report, will be joining us from the prison planet, exposing the global tyranny.
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:45.384]  In about 30 minutes, we're going to have wide open phones getting your response to Ronald Reagan, a Hollywood actor, who was in big political fights in the primary with George Herbert Walker Bush.
[01:00:46.045 --> 01:00:56.148]  Then George Herbert Walker Bush's business partner's son supposedly shot Ronald Reagan, but Ronald Reagan told the New York Times he thought that at first it was the Secret Service shooting him,
[01:00:57.063 --> 01:00:58.825]  But we're just supposed to ignore all of that.
[01:00:59.826 --> 01:01:06.214]  And the Hinkleys also ran the company that produced the shooter of John Lennon three months before.
[01:01:06.294 --> 01:01:09.498]  Very interesting family in business with the Bushes.
[01:01:10.138 --> 01:01:13.542]  Living in the same town with the Bushes, Midland, Texas.
[01:01:13.622 --> 01:01:16.626]  Multiple Bush siblings working for the Hinkleys.
[01:01:18.288 --> 01:01:20.910]  So, we'll go over some of that evidence we have not yet covered.
[01:01:20.951 --> 01:01:23.293]  It's a good time to bring all this back up to people.
[01:01:23.333 --> 01:01:31.240]  We've got some different news articles and synopses up there on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com for you.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:35.023]  The government's saying there's an upcoming terror attack here in the next few months.
[01:01:35.043 --> 01:01:36.845]  There's a lot of indicators that that could happen.
[01:01:37.485 --> 01:01:38.325]  I want to get into that.
[01:01:38.385 --> 01:01:39.666]  The Bilderberg Group as well.
[01:01:40.006 --> 01:01:41.606]  A lot of 9-11 prior knowledge.
[01:01:41.646 --> 01:01:43.827]  But we're continuing with the Reagan situation.
[01:01:44.247 --> 01:01:45.427]  Dead at 93.
[01:01:45.607 --> 01:01:49.428]  Died Saturday at his home in Bel Air in California.
[01:01:50.428 --> 01:01:51.249]  In Los Angeles.
[01:01:52.269 --> 01:01:54.430]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:01:54.590 --> 01:01:55.590]  Jeff in Florida.
[01:01:55.650 --> 01:01:56.510]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[01:01:56.550 --> 01:01:56.990]  Go ahead.
[01:01:57.010 --> 01:01:58.531]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:01:58.831 --> 01:01:59.251]  Fine sir.
[01:01:59.551 --> 01:01:59.791]  Good.
[01:02:00.556 --> 01:02:12.019]  If anybody wants to know more about this, I don't know if you carry this book or not, but I recently got this from the John Birch Society, the book called The Insiders, about all the Presidents.
[01:02:12.039 --> 01:02:25.222]  It was made back when Clinton was still in office, but it goes all the way back to the Cotter Administration, and talking about how the Council on Foreign Relations, the trilateral... That's who makes up the entire Cabinet.
[01:02:25.842 --> 01:02:28.603]  It's a rarity to have somebody in the Cabinet that isn't a member.
[01:02:29.330 --> 01:02:45.545]  And it's talking about, it gives dates and, you know, references and everything, but it's talking about exactly what you just said about how Reagan and... Well Ronald Reagan told members of the press at the convention that he was threatened by Bush and others and Kissinger that he better play ball.
[01:02:46.025 --> 01:02:46.586]  Exactly.
[01:02:46.806 --> 01:02:47.927]  And now this is on the record.
[01:02:47.967 --> 01:02:57.413]  It's on the record that Reagan attacked Bush as a globalist during the primaries from 1979 into the campaign in 1980, calling him a globalist.
[01:02:57.713 --> 01:02:58.954]  And now Bush Sr.
[01:02:58.994 --> 01:03:09.862]  has the nerve to go, oh, in the main newspapers yesterday, oh, Bush, you know, said, oh, Reagan helped the New World Order.
[01:03:10.863 --> 01:03:11.483]  Exactly.
[01:03:11.503 --> 01:03:12.764]  And see, in this book here,
[01:03:13.337 --> 01:03:17.099]  It's a small book, you know, people don't like reading that much, it won't take much time.
[01:03:18.681 --> 01:03:30.388]  They have several quotes, just from Bush Senior, you know, one from that tape that you played earlier, you know, the New World Order can't emerge, and billions of others New World Order quotes from him.
[01:03:30.468 --> 01:03:34.331]  Yeah, he said it about 230-something times when he was in the White House.
[01:03:34.971 --> 01:03:36.252]  He said it dozens of times.
[01:03:36.292 --> 01:03:38.473]  He said it again Saturday night to a reporter.
[01:03:38.994 --> 01:03:40.394]  Exactly.
[01:03:40.515 --> 01:03:42.516]  It's in the main news right now.
[01:03:43.143 --> 01:03:51.092]  And also, we were at a flea market getting people to sign a petition and everything to stop the FTAA.
[01:03:52.913 --> 01:03:56.077]  Free Trade Area of the Americas with the Pan American Union.
[01:03:56.597 --> 01:03:59.140]  Yeah, and we got a lot of people responding.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.723]  We got a lot of people, one guy called us a conspiracy.
[01:04:02.355 --> 01:04:06.017]  Kind of like what Sean Handy calls us.
[01:04:06.137 --> 01:04:12.321]  Because there's publicly getting rid of the borders, setting up giant meetings in Miami, publicly doing this.
[01:04:12.421 --> 01:04:13.402]  It doesn't exist.
[01:04:13.762 --> 01:04:16.443]  If there's anything I'll have to have a responsibility in facing.
[01:04:17.344 --> 01:04:18.725]  The doctor says you've got brain cancer.
[01:04:18.765 --> 01:04:19.205]  No, I don't.
[01:04:19.245 --> 01:04:19.605]  Shut up.
[01:04:20.306 --> 01:04:20.766]  Yes, you do.
[01:04:20.826 --> 01:04:21.226]  No, I don't.
[01:04:21.286 --> 01:04:21.626]  Shut up.
[01:04:21.646 --> 01:04:22.207]  Thanks for the call.
[01:04:22.847 --> 01:04:23.527]  I appreciate it.
[01:04:24.148 --> 01:04:26.689]  Yeah, this incredible denial.
[01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:29.251]  I mean, they're still saying there's not a new world order.
[01:04:30.490 --> 01:04:31.031]  As the U.N.
[01:04:31.071 --> 01:04:35.354]  openly calls for world government, world taxation, as the Supreme Court says they're under U.N.
[01:04:35.394 --> 01:04:39.999]  control in the front page of USA Today, as they rule according to U.N.
[01:04:40.099 --> 01:04:41.840]  edicts, it doesn't exist!
[01:04:42.681 --> 01:04:43.742]  Tyranny doesn't exist!
[01:04:43.762 --> 01:04:50.488]  Just lay down a government, worship it, government's God, don't control it, the Founding Fathers were bad, they were conspiracy theorists too.
[01:04:53.254 --> 01:04:54.735]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:54.915 --> 01:04:58.016]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:04:58.136 --> 01:05:02.018]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:05:02.078 --> 01:05:06.341]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:05:06.681 --> 01:05:10.463]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:05:10.543 --> 01:05:12.424]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:05:12.584 --> 01:05:15.885]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[01:05:15.925 --> 01:05:17.026]  The medical bills!
[01:05:18.635 --> 01:05:20.656]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[01:05:20.796 --> 01:05:23.837]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:05:24.018 --> 01:05:26.919]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:05:27.359 --> 01:05:33.503]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:05:34.023 --> 01:05:37.828]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:06:01.475 --> 01:06:12.765]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:06:12.965 --> 01:06:15.608]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:06:15.948 --> 01:06:22.416]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:06:22.576 --> 01:06:24.438]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:06:24.638 --> 01:06:30.665]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:06:30.925 --> 01:06:36.592]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[01:06:52.659 --> 01:06:54.340]  Is the air you breathe killing you?
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:55.240]  What?
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:07:01.483]  The Environmental Protection Agency studies state that indoor air is up to 70 times more polluted than outdoor city air.
[01:07:01.823 --> 01:07:03.583]  Even Oprah addressed this concern on Persia.
[01:07:04.024 --> 01:07:04.484]  Heard enough?
[01:07:05.091 --> 01:07:05.732]  Sure have!

[01:07:59.113 --> 01:08:00.173]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:00.873 --> 01:08:02.014]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:02.034 --> 01:08:03.454]  You want answers?
[01:08:04.214 --> 01:08:05.134]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:05.154 --> 01:08:09.435]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.955 --> 01:08:14.076]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:17.697 --> 01:08:21.338]  Alright, we have the Hinckley family.
[01:08:23.578 --> 01:08:27.159]  John W. Hinckley, father of John Hinckley Jr.
[01:08:28.339 --> 01:08:44.190]  It was President of the Board of World Vision, the CIA front, that developed the individual who had just worked for them overseas and suddenly came back and shot John Lennon three months before Ronald Reagan was shot.
[01:08:44.411 --> 01:08:45.812]  They lived in Midland.
[01:08:46.112 --> 01:08:48.714]  They were business partners with the Bushes, socially hung out with them.
[01:08:49.074 --> 01:08:50.195]  Neal worked for the family.
[01:08:50.215 --> 01:08:51.456]  They had dinner with Hinkley Jr.
[01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:56.084]  The Secret Service helped to set up Reagan too.
[01:08:56.184 --> 01:09:00.207]  Reagan was told not to wear his vest that day, his protective vest.
[01:09:01.288 --> 01:09:08.133]  And it continues that they did not follow his normal protective measures with a limousine.
[01:09:08.173 --> 01:09:10.895]  He should have come out the door and gone directly into the limousine.
[01:09:11.315 --> 01:09:12.436]  That's how he arrived.
[01:09:12.476 --> 01:09:12.956]  He came.
[01:09:12.976 --> 01:09:16.839]  The Secret Service formed two rows on either side of the back door.
[01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:18.921]  They opened the back door and he goes in.
[01:09:19.707 --> 01:09:22.748]  When you hire a limousine, they don't go to the house down the street.
[01:09:22.788 --> 01:09:24.069]  They come to your door.
[01:09:24.749 --> 01:09:26.530]  But not when they pulled up to get Reagan.
[01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:27.750]  He had to walk down the street.
[01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:28.770]  That's why he looked confused.
[01:09:29.731 --> 01:09:34.333]  When you're the president, they move it six inches to make sure that it's in the right place.
[01:09:35.093 --> 01:09:36.893]  It was in the right place when he arrived.
[01:09:36.954 --> 01:09:38.014]  He got out and went
[01:09:38.686 --> 01:09:41.707]  through the phalanx of the two rows of agents.
[01:09:41.767 --> 01:09:44.287]  He's safe into the VIP entrance.
[01:09:44.768 --> 01:09:46.868]  He comes out of the same exit.
[01:09:47.108 --> 01:09:47.888]  Where's the car?
[01:09:47.928 --> 01:09:49.289]  It's nowhere near the door.
[01:09:49.729 --> 01:09:50.809]  Just like with Yishak Rabin.
[01:09:51.389 --> 01:09:55.730]  It's 40 to 50 feet down the pavement, so he's got to walk out into the open.
[01:09:56.570 --> 01:09:57.531]  What's supposed to happen?
[01:09:57.831 --> 01:10:01.212]  The Secret Service is supposed to surround him like a diamond and protect him.
[01:10:01.632 --> 01:10:02.652]  One guy goes forward,
[01:10:03.969 --> 01:10:07.351]  McCarthy to open the door for him, the rest don't surround him.
[01:10:07.692 --> 01:10:16.497]  They all file out like a line of ducks off to the right and then they leave Reagan walking in the open with Brady and those other guys.
[01:10:16.597 --> 01:10:17.818]  Then the shooting happens.
[01:10:18.499 --> 01:10:23.342]  The damage that was done there once the shooting started was quite extensive.
[01:10:24.322 --> 01:10:29.966]  Brady was hit which literally took a large chunk out of his brain and knocked him to the ground.
[01:10:30.786 --> 01:10:32.908]  A black cot was nicked in the neck.
[01:10:33.642 --> 01:10:37.743]  A big beefy cop and he spun and hit the ground hard on the spot.
[01:10:38.163 --> 01:10:39.083]  Not a .22, folks.
[01:10:39.644 --> 01:10:49.706]  McCarthy, 160 pounds, was lifted by the shot that hit him in the groin at the back door of the car and thrown through the air to the front bumper of the car.
[01:10:50.106 --> 01:10:54.327]  He himself says that it was no .22 caliber.
[01:10:55.287 --> 01:10:57.488]  You shoot people with .22s and don't even know it for a second or two.
[01:10:58.675 --> 01:11:05.127]  All of the early press reports are that Hinckley was firing a .38 and that it is much more consistent with these kinds of reactions.
[01:11:05.689 --> 01:11:06.731]  A .22 will hurt you.
[01:11:07.903 --> 01:11:11.504]  injure you and do more damage inside you but it's not going to knock you over.
[01:11:11.544 --> 01:11:13.905]  A .38 is a much larger caliber of bullet.
[01:11:14.325 --> 01:11:20.788]  Hinckley purchased a .38 at a pawn shop on Elm Street in Dallas, the same street where Kennedy was assassinated.
[01:11:21.668 --> 01:11:26.630]  Then the official story changes after three or four hours and Hinckley supposedly had a .22.
[01:11:27.190 --> 01:11:35.153]  I went through the ABC News footage and you can actually see the replacement of a .22 and the pickup of a .38 by a Secret Service agent.
[01:11:35.653 --> 01:11:44.718]  Hinkley, instead of being taken under civilian custody, or even federal custody, he is a military district in D.C., but he is also in several federal districts.
[01:11:45.038 --> 01:11:50.221]  He is whisked off to Quantico Marine Base, and that's where he is held for questioning.
[01:11:51.182 --> 01:11:58.406]  I think this was part of the debriefing and the programming, but he's not taken under civilian control, he's taken under military custody.
[01:11:58.985 --> 01:12:12.575]  Then he's moved from there to the psychiatric evaluation at Fort Butner, South Carolina, which was the first prison, it's even been in the mainstream news, that was developed where the cells and the blueprints were called labs.
[01:12:13.797 --> 01:12:16.981]  It was the first mind control experimentation prison in the country.
[01:12:17.141 --> 01:12:29.536]  He spends his time down there again with a group of psychiatrists that are interlinked with other assassinations and then he is eventually brought to the court and declared not guilty by reason of insanity for the assassination attempt.
[01:12:29.576 --> 01:12:31.418]  Now they're letting him out of the mental institution today.
[01:12:32.213 --> 01:12:36.354]  It's a convoluted story, but the parameters are always the same.
[01:12:36.394 --> 01:12:38.275]  You have a patsy that takes the blame.
[01:12:38.635 --> 01:12:41.096]  You have a second gumman that never comes to light.
[01:12:41.156 --> 01:12:49.099]  And indeed, Reagan told the Associated Press he thought that he was shot by Secret Service agents in an interview published in the New York Times, April 23, 1981.
[01:12:49.679 --> 01:12:59.322]  Quote, I knew I had been hurt, but I thought that I'd been hurt by the Secret Service, man.
[01:13:00.123 --> 01:13:05.529]  Landing on me in the car, and it was, I must say, it was the most paralyzing pain.
[01:13:05.609 --> 01:13:09.332]  I've described it as if someone had hit you with a hammer.
[01:13:10.874 --> 01:13:14.578]  But the sensation, it seems to me, came after I was in the car.
[01:13:15.398 --> 01:13:17.921]  So I thought that maybe his gun or something.
[01:13:18.001 --> 01:13:21.204]  Suddenly, I found that I was coughing up blood.
[01:13:22.245 --> 01:13:22.766]  Then after
[01:13:24.218 --> 01:13:29.620]  That Reagan got himself to George Washington Hospital despite attempts to bring him to the Bethesda Mailbox.
[01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:30.580]  He argued with them.
[01:13:33.121 --> 01:13:35.682]  He actually said, I'm the president, take me here.
[01:13:36.282 --> 01:13:41.164]  Michael Gilson, The Lemon's author and member of the National Committee on U.S.
[01:13:41.244 --> 01:13:49.947]  Libertarian Party, picks up the story, writing on January 20, 2002, when Reagan was shot, he apparently assumed that his vice president did it.
[01:13:50.507 --> 01:13:51.367]  How do I know this?
[01:13:51.427 --> 01:14:00.310]  From the fascinating information that my mother, who volunteered at the hospital where he was taken, and was a friend of his from old Hollywood days, shared with me.
[01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:03.691]  It seems that shortly after he woke up, he asked for a D.C.
[01:14:03.731 --> 01:14:07.492]  patrol officer, had this person find a U.S.
[01:14:07.572 --> 01:14:19.456]  ship that had just reached the area, and soon sailors with sidearms guarded his bedside while he placed the whole hospital under his direct command and swore all the secrecy.
[01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:22.851]  They buffered him from the Secret Service and anyone else!
[01:14:23.624 --> 01:14:24.785]  This is on the record, too.
[01:14:25.145 --> 01:14:50.024]  He trusted no one, and perhaps by protecting himself with unentangled sailors from the officers fresh from sea, saved his own life and the country from one more bleak mark of shame on one fellow catcher of the rye devotee and a .38 caliber enthusiast and guest of world vision, again the same folks out with the employees blasting other people, was alleged
[01:14:51.345 --> 01:14:54.266]  Apparent Lennon assassin Mark David Chapman.
[01:14:56.946 --> 01:14:58.947]  Let me just recap this and I'll go straight to your calls.
[01:15:00.127 --> 01:15:04.168]  You have Neil Bush working for John Hinckley Sr.
[01:15:04.808 --> 01:15:06.288]  You have John Hinckley Sr.
[01:15:06.408 --> 01:15:16.190]  in business with the Bushes, in two separate oil companies in Medlin, in the country club together, dinner together, some of the biggest campaign contributors, Associated Press from 1981 reporting.
[01:15:18.337 --> 01:15:36.799]  You have the Hinckleys as the head of World Vision, the CIA front that only pops up in conflict zones, with its quote, missionary front group, with Mark David Chapman, the supposed shooter of John Lennon, who works at World Vision, leaves Latin America,
[01:15:37.845 --> 01:15:44.930]  Shows up, goes directly to the hotel, and blasts Lennon, who'd suddenly stopped being a socialist.
[01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:46.311]  And I've got the songs.
[01:15:46.351 --> 01:15:47.172]  We ought to play some of these.
[01:15:47.472 --> 01:15:51.915]  New World Order, Illuminati, you devil worshippers, we're gonna stop you.
[01:15:51.935 --> 01:15:55.677]  I mean, boy, he was dead within a month of releasing that CD.
[01:15:56.478 --> 01:15:57.719]  I've never heard it on the radio.
[01:15:58.319 --> 01:15:59.180]  It's amazing stuff.
[01:15:59.941 --> 01:16:01.703]  In fact, I keep saying I've got that at my studio.
[01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:04.025]  I need to bring that down here and play it for you.
[01:16:04.525 --> 01:16:06.027]  He gets blasted all of a sudden.
[01:16:06.047 --> 01:16:08.169]  They couldn't have him spouting off about the New World Order.
[01:16:08.869 --> 01:16:11.592]  And it's a World Vision employee doing it.
[01:16:12.847 --> 01:16:14.307]  It's just incredible stuff.
[01:16:14.728 --> 01:16:16.948]  And then you've got Hinckley, the son of this guy.
[01:16:16.968 --> 01:16:20.790]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on and on.
[01:16:21.190 --> 01:16:23.851]  That's the same thing with Yashak Rabin going, where's my limousine?
[01:16:23.891 --> 01:16:24.471]  What's going on?
[01:16:24.531 --> 01:16:25.371]  Walk through here, sir.
[01:16:25.651 --> 01:16:28.092]  They all step back, shots ring out, he gets in the car.
[01:16:28.592 --> 01:16:31.293]  And then we've had the reporters on, the doctors, all the people.
[01:16:31.333 --> 01:16:34.714]  He was shot multiple times, not given treatment at the hospital, and he died.
[01:16:35.534 --> 01:16:36.935]  It's the oldest trick in the book.
[01:16:37.495 --> 01:16:40.596]  It's like the Secret Service pulling off of Kennedy.
[01:16:41.914 --> 01:16:45.417]  You know, telling him, oh, here's your car today, this opened back when you're supposed to ride in.
[01:16:45.517 --> 01:16:45.757]  What?
[01:16:45.958 --> 01:16:46.518]  Uh, yeah!
[01:16:47.279 --> 01:16:51.042]  And LBJ on the radio the whole time and his own lawyer saying he had him killed.
[01:16:51.102 --> 01:16:53.244]  I mean, stop being a naive people!
[01:16:54.265 --> 01:16:59.730]  They were better enemies in the 1980 campaign, George Herbert Walker and Ronald Reagan.
[01:17:01.071 --> 01:17:06.436]  And suddenly there was no more talk of abolishing the IRS or getting rid of the BATF.
[01:17:07.308 --> 01:17:13.433]  Suddenly, the government expands radically in spending and explodes and all of this happens.
[01:17:14.755 --> 01:17:15.035]  Okay.
[01:17:15.856 --> 01:17:17.277]  I don't want to keep going on forever here.
[01:17:17.337 --> 01:17:19.639]  Let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[01:17:19.699 --> 01:17:22.881]  I guess up next is Terry in Washington.
[01:17:22.922 --> 01:17:23.622]  Go ahead, Terry.
[01:17:24.123 --> 01:17:24.963]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:17:25.003 --> 01:17:25.464]  Good morning.
[01:17:26.685 --> 01:17:30.428]  You were talking about how Hinkley was working as
[01:17:32.430 --> 01:17:37.513]  A agent for the Vanderbilt Dry Wells sort of laundering money?
[01:17:38.454 --> 01:17:40.595]  Well, that's what the news reports I was reading said.
[01:17:41.136 --> 01:17:46.839]  Yeah, well, as you know and I know, the Vanderbilts were one of the pillars of the Skull and Bones, right?
[01:17:47.019 --> 01:17:47.520]  That's right.
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:18:01.689]  And the other day when you were on vacation, I turned over to C-SPAN, and the guy that's the news anchor for CNN, his name is Anderson Cooper.
[01:18:02.816 --> 01:18:03.816]  You know who he be?
[01:18:05.257 --> 01:18:07.738]  It rings a bell, but why don't you enlighten me?
[01:18:08.278 --> 01:18:16.902]  Well, he was telling some little colored kids how they can be a success too, that he worked hard in his life and he made it.
[01:18:17.482 --> 01:18:24.805]  And one of the little colored girls stood up and says, well, don't you think you had a bigger advantage being the son of a Vanderbilt?
[01:18:25.766 --> 01:18:27.586]  And he just stood there sort of shocked.
[01:18:29.423 --> 01:18:31.404]  They're a lot smarter than he is.
[01:18:31.444 --> 01:18:52.780]  Yeah, he says, well, yes, my mother was a Vanderbilt, and I did have some advantages like going to... Well, that's the point, is it's all this giant nest of Hinkley's and Vanderbilt's and Chaney's and Bush's and Carey's, all nesting, running this giant theater scam on us,
[01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:55.482]  And Bush tried to defeat Reagan.
[01:18:55.562 --> 01:18:56.423]  Reagan won.
[01:18:57.144 --> 01:19:00.787]  He was basically just a puppet, but thought he was really supposed to be a conservative.
[01:19:01.147 --> 01:19:07.233]  And he told Mr. Skousen, this is on the record, that they threatened me to go along with what they say.
[01:19:08.534 --> 01:19:10.196]  So it's all on the record.
[01:19:10.616 --> 01:19:16.141]  Yeah, we've got Vanderbilt scone bones telling us what the news is, even.
[01:19:16.541 --> 01:19:18.083]  We're the ones that are being brainwashed.
[01:19:18.832 --> 01:19:19.833]  I hear you, my friend.
[01:19:20.193 --> 01:19:24.495]  Well, that's about all I got for you, and remember to bring in that Beatle album for us old guys, eh?
[01:19:25.256 --> 01:19:25.556]  Okay?
[01:19:25.916 --> 01:19:26.556]  Well, thank you.
[01:19:27.016 --> 01:19:35.161]  Yeah, it's a compilation of one of my employees, Bart, that was making copies of it, and I haven't found it since.
[01:19:35.181 --> 01:19:36.522]  I know it's somewhere up there at the office.
[01:19:36.542 --> 01:19:38.603]  I need to get that, I need to play that.
[01:19:38.623 --> 01:19:47.988]  Because, I mean, literally, the lyrics are like, Illuminati, you devil worshippers, you've found it all, we're going to expose you, and then... No, you're not.
[01:19:49.396 --> 01:19:50.992]  World Vision dropped by.
[01:19:53.450 --> 01:19:54.211]  Terrorism!
[01:19:54.371 --> 01:19:55.111]  Terrorism!
[01:19:55.211 --> 01:20:01.276]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:20:01.537 --> 01:20:03.138]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:20:03.378 --> 01:20:05.860]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:20.812]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:20:20.852 --> 01:20:21.172]  government.
[01:20:21.352 --> 01:20:23.154]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:20:23.514 --> 01:20:29.439]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:20:29.579 --> 01:20:34.062]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[01:20:53.809 --> 01:20:56.029]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:20:56.470 --> 01:21:00.811]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:21:01.091 --> 01:21:06.892]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:21:07.132 --> 01:21:11.173]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:21:11.473 --> 01:21:17.114]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[01:21:17.214 --> 01:21:19.835]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:21:21.935 --> 01:21:25.837]  By mid-1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[01:21:25.877 --> 01:21:28.257]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[01:21:28.598 --> 01:21:30.898]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[01:21:31.279 --> 01:21:34.920]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:41.583]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[01:21:42.043 --> 01:21:43.023]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:21:43.363 --> 01:21:43.683]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:43.703 --> 01:21:43.883]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:52.213 --> 01:21:58.497]  Maka is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[01:21:58.857 --> 01:22:02.939]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:10.664]  Only recently has science discovered that Maka is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[01:22:11.204 --> 01:22:18.549]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels.
[01:22:18.909 --> 01:22:21.150]  Increased libido, which helps prevent impotence.
[01:22:21.491 --> 01:22:24.753]  Relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort.
[01:22:25.133 --> 01:22:28.295]  Helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and night sweats.
[01:22:28.595 --> 01:22:31.517]  It also helps prevent osteoporosis and joint pain.
[01:22:31.997 --> 01:22:37.101]  Get your mock-up from Cliff Scott Enterprises at a price and quality that few can match.
[01:22:37.262 --> 01:22:40.164]  Because we get our mock-up fresh from the growers in Peru.
[01:22:40.604 --> 01:22:42.086]  Call 800-569-4340 for incredible savings.
[01:22:42.146 --> 01:22:43.907]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at cliffscott.com
[01:22:52.314 --> 01:22:54.676]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:22:54.936 --> 01:22:58.759]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:22:59.900]  Read the labels.
[01:23:00.341 --> 01:23:04.464]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:23:04.684 --> 01:23:08.868]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:23:09.248 --> 01:23:14.132]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:23:14.492 --> 01:23:18.094]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:23:18.274 --> 01:23:23.616]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:23:23.876 --> 01:23:26.617]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:23:26.917 --> 01:23:27.797]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:23:28.118 --> 01:23:38.842]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[01:23:42.704 --> 01:23:44.965]  Alright, we're going to get into Bilderberg Group.
[01:23:45.005 --> 01:23:45.246]  More 9-11.
[01:23:45.286 --> 01:23:46.426]  Prior knowledge evidence.
[01:23:46.446 --> 01:23:57.172]  A ton of news coming up here in just about 10 minutes.
[01:24:09.136 --> 01:24:11.217]  Let's try to get through as many of these calls as possible.
[01:24:11.998 --> 01:24:16.260]  Let's go ahead and talk to Myron in South Dakota, then Eric, John, JR, Jim, and others.
[01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:17.041]  Go ahead, Myron.
[01:24:17.521 --> 01:24:18.041]  Yes, Alex.
[01:24:18.181 --> 01:24:23.825]  I'm maybe a little more critical of Ronald Reagan because I happen to know his beginnings.
[01:24:24.645 --> 01:24:32.109]  For instance, when he ran for governor in California, he was running against Pat Brown, with Pat Brown being this wild, bending liberal.
[01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:38.213]  And after Reagan got elected, all the people who helped him to get elected
[01:24:38.601 --> 01:24:45.386]  We're pushed aside and the people who are condemning him and backstabbing him all the way up were appointed to key cabinet positions.
[01:24:46.187 --> 01:24:52.311]  That to me, that was a pretty much of a telltale that sometimes things aren't what they seem like.
[01:24:52.871 --> 01:24:57.455]  Well, I mean, the government exploded in size, all this happened, but don't confuse me with the facts.
[01:24:57.495 --> 01:25:00.117]  He was an actor and I bought the acting.
[01:25:00.637 --> 01:25:04.780]  But look, I mean, to be completely serious though, he was obviously better than George Bush.
[01:25:06.250 --> 01:25:07.991]  And that's why they clearly went after him.
[01:25:08.191 --> 01:25:10.072]  I'm talking about as Governor of California.
[01:25:10.092 --> 01:25:10.552]  No, I know!
[01:25:10.672 --> 01:25:12.633]  I mean, he finished two terms.
[01:25:12.713 --> 01:25:15.274]  He has tripled the size of the budget in California.
[01:25:15.314 --> 01:25:15.794]  No, I know.
[01:25:15.814 --> 01:25:16.815]  Increased the taxes.
[01:25:17.335 --> 01:25:32.841]  So, I had a friend of mine tell me at that time, right after he got elected, Major Pedro Diaz-Lanz, who helped Castro get into power, who was in charge of the Air Force for six months, until he denounced Castro as a communist, came to this country, testified before the Senate Select Committee,
[01:25:33.354 --> 01:25:33.875]  I don't think so.
[01:25:47.842 --> 01:25:52.223]  And he told me, be careful, don't listen to what they're saying, just watch what they're doing.
[01:25:52.363 --> 01:25:56.383]  And I started doing that, and I tell you what, I had some of the worst months of my life.
[01:25:56.624 --> 01:25:57.584]  I'll tell you, that's bad.
[01:25:57.624 --> 01:26:00.284]  You shouldn't watch what people do, you should just believe what they say.
[01:26:00.444 --> 01:26:06.105]  Right, and this is what most conservatives do, they just follow the rhetoric and they don't look what the guy is doing.
[01:26:06.165 --> 01:26:10.126]  Hey, all the liberal media is telling us he was the most conservative ever, it must be true, thanks for the call.
[01:26:10.726 --> 01:26:17.047]  Now it is true that the government roughly doubled, you were saying tripled, in California under Reagan, but let's just ignore that, okay?
[01:26:18.029 --> 01:26:19.750]  Because if you attack him, you're with the liberals.
[01:26:19.770 --> 01:26:21.511]  I don't have anything against Ronald Reagan.
[01:26:21.531 --> 01:26:22.592]  He was an actor, folks.
[01:26:22.972 --> 01:26:25.074]  But the people behind him were very, very bad.
[01:26:26.775 --> 01:26:29.637]  And the Bushes were certainly angry at him during the campaign for some reason.
[01:26:30.277 --> 01:26:32.158]  Let's go ahead and talk to Eric in Texas.
[01:26:32.239 --> 01:26:32.899]  Eric, go ahead.
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:34.500]  Hey, Alex.
[01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:36.942]  I'm one of your Prison Planet contributors.
[01:26:37.342 --> 01:26:39.483]  I have a book coming out next month.
[01:26:39.503 --> 01:26:41.285]  I have some more information to add to all that.
[01:26:41.825 --> 01:26:42.345]  Bush Sr.
[01:26:42.365 --> 01:26:45.447]  and Scott Hinckley separately contributed to John Connally in 1979
[01:26:46.673 --> 01:26:50.874]  He was leading a campaign to stop Reagan from gaining the presidential nomination.
[01:26:51.674 --> 01:27:01.116]  Also about the Secret Service shooting at him, Judy Woodruff, an NBC News correspondent, claimed that she saw shots fired from the top of the roof that day.
[01:27:01.136 --> 01:27:03.497]  So that's just more information.
[01:27:03.817 --> 01:27:07.338]  Do you have an Associated Press article or something on that?
[01:27:08.058 --> 01:27:09.138]  I can dig that up.
[01:27:09.648 --> 01:27:10.148]  I have it all.
[01:27:10.249 --> 01:27:11.990]  I have a full bibliography on this.
[01:27:12.190 --> 01:27:17.854]  Yeah, email it to tipsandinfowars.com or to the webmaster there at Prison Planet.
[01:27:17.894 --> 01:27:19.875]  Contact the webmaster and we'll post all that.
[01:27:20.396 --> 01:27:24.459]  Hey Alex, also we can't dismiss the Skull and Bones connection.
[01:27:24.479 --> 01:27:28.702]  It's so obvious that a lot of conservatives don't want to make that jump.
[01:27:29.722 --> 01:27:33.165]  And also about Alexandra Robbins' book, she is a secret
[01:27:33.732 --> 01:27:36.613]  She's a society member of Yale College, and she's getting all the hoopla.
[01:27:36.653 --> 01:27:39.694]  Yeah, she was a member of Scrolling T. That's a disinformation group.
[01:27:39.754 --> 01:27:42.274]  She was a member of Scrolling T. We've interviewed her.
[01:27:42.734 --> 01:27:44.755]  And she only brings out some of the evidence.
[01:27:45.255 --> 01:27:49.456]  She brings out enough to make people think she's telling the truth, and then she puts the disinformation in.
[01:27:49.496 --> 01:27:50.177]  Yeah, I know.
[01:27:50.257 --> 01:27:50.437]  Yeah.
[01:27:50.997 --> 01:27:51.377]  Yeah.
[01:27:51.977 --> 01:27:55.378]  Well, um, people should find out about that Solos connection.
[01:27:55.398 --> 01:27:58.859]  And then there's another, that's just one more, you know, skin on the onion.
[01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:01.350]  Absolutely good.
[01:28:01.370 --> 01:28:02.691]  Fill them back and fill them back.
[01:28:02.931 --> 01:28:03.912]  Send me a copy of your book.
[01:28:03.952 --> 01:28:04.352]  Take care.
[01:28:05.113 --> 01:28:06.674]  Let's talk to John in Tennessee.
[01:28:06.734 --> 01:28:07.515]  John, go ahead.
[01:28:08.996 --> 01:28:14.740]  Yes, Ronald Reagan's daughter from his second marriage, Patty, wrote an autobiography titled, The Way I See It.
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:21.726]  She said Ronald Reagan did not even recognize his own son, Michael, from his first marriage when he graduated high school in the 70s.
[01:28:21.766 --> 01:28:29.772]  She also confessed that she was a drug dealer in California and Governor Reagan protected her from police raids.
[01:28:30.942 --> 01:28:39.426]  He did confess that Reagan and Bush conspired treason with the Iranian terrorists to hold Jimmy Carter's embassy staff hostage when the election.
[01:28:39.466 --> 01:28:44.909]  That was the start of Iran-Contra with the October surprise and the hostages were not released.
[01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:48.942]  Until the actual Reagan-Bush inauguration ceremony.
[01:28:48.982 --> 01:28:53.285]  But you know that Reagan and Bush were fighting with each other during the primary.
[01:28:53.405 --> 01:28:57.628]  From the evidence, isn't it clear to you that there was foul play with Hinckley?
[01:28:58.068 --> 01:28:58.568]  Of course.
[01:28:58.708 --> 01:29:02.471]  And she said that Bush extorted his way
[01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:06.362]  Into the Reagan ticket, just the way LBJ did with Kennedy.
[01:29:06.822 --> 01:29:10.825]  Well, that's admitted from what Reagan was saying to the press at the time of the convention.
[01:29:11.165 --> 01:29:19.470]  Right, and she was so disgusted with all this that she changed her name from Reagan to Davis, even though Nancy was a total psycho who destroyed their family.
[01:29:21.692 --> 01:29:25.094]  Well, look, I'm going to believe the Hollywood image from the actor.
[01:29:25.194 --> 01:29:28.336]  I'm not going to... I think bigger government's good and conservative, okay?
[01:29:28.356 --> 01:29:31.058]  Don't forget that Kitty Kelly wrote that
[01:29:32.065 --> 01:29:32.925]  George Bush Sr.
[01:29:32.946 --> 01:29:37.368]  was arrested while he was Vice President after he crashed his car in D.C.
[01:29:37.408 --> 01:29:40.129]  on a date with his mistress and was arrested for drunk driving.
[01:29:40.309 --> 01:29:41.690]  Well, let's not discuss that either.
[01:29:43.691 --> 01:29:44.572]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.072 --> 01:29:46.693]  The Empire's on the run.

[01:33:20.109 --> 01:33:23.571]  I want to get Paul Watson's take here in just a few minutes on Reagan.
[01:33:25.372 --> 01:33:26.213]  God rest his soul.
[01:33:27.113 --> 01:33:32.956]  And then I also want to get into the latest Bilderberg Group developments, some new 9-11 information, a ton of other news we need to cover.
[01:33:33.616 --> 01:33:46.922]  Before we go to Paul Watson, though, and shotgun through this news, I do want to encourage all of you to get his book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and the New World Order.
[01:33:47.422 --> 01:33:52.244]  Remember a few months ago we played the clip of Bush going, we're there to bring chaos, and then order.
[01:33:52.504 --> 01:33:53.765]  I mean, order out of chaos.
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:56.401]  That's their motto.
[01:33:56.481 --> 01:33:59.922]  They create the crises to offer you the solution.
[01:34:00.523 --> 01:34:13.849]  An Order Out of Chaos is 324 pages long, full of diagrams, documents, news articles, covers dozens of different examples of government-sponsored terror, how government carries out the terror to scare us into submission.
[01:34:14.289 --> 01:34:16.310]  There's my book, 9-11, Dissent and the Tyranny.
[01:34:16.990 --> 01:34:22.633]  There's the two films I've made on September 11th, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, and Part 2, The Masters of Terror.

[01:34:46.316 --> 01:34:50.598]  They have video of FEMA saying all Christians are terrorists, homeschoolers are terrorists.
[01:34:51.498 --> 01:34:53.819]  They have video of Marines training to put us in camps.
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:55.520]  Then they're going to wake up.
[01:34:56.292 --> 01:34:56.672]  Okay.
[01:34:57.413 --> 01:34:59.293]  You need to have these videos.

[01:36:01.683 --> 01:36:04.145]  Don't stand idly by with the Global Issues Terror.
[01:36:04.165 --> 01:36:04.885]  You're totally enslaved.
[01:36:15.379 --> 01:36:23.664]  Paul Watson, we've got a ton of news I want to go through and a bunch of calls, but first off, we've got a lot of information posted on the sites about Ronald Reagan.
[01:36:23.744 --> 01:36:25.305]  I'm not here to attack Ronald Reagan.
[01:36:27.246 --> 01:36:31.109]  You know, I mean, compared to Bush and Clinton and people, I mean, he was a conservative, I guess.
[01:36:31.829 --> 01:36:34.651]  But the point is, is that we have to face the facts.
[01:36:35.071 --> 01:36:37.513]  And in a nutshell, what are the facts, Paul?
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:48.287]  Well, I mean, the facts are, as you've documented earlier on in the show, is that basically Reagan was... the Reagan government was the first Bush senior government.
[01:36:48.967 --> 01:37:02.417]  Because during the 1980 presidential campaign, Reagan actually went on the record to vilify the 19 trilateral commission members that were in the Carter administration, which included Carter himself, obviously.
[01:37:03.266 --> 01:37:07.850]  And also George Bush, because he was a member of both the Trilaterals and the CFR.
[01:37:08.350 --> 01:37:16.076]  And so it's on the record that Reagan pledged that he would never allow Bush, Bush Senior that is, a position in the Reagan government.
[01:37:16.917 --> 01:37:25.323]  And so the Republican National Convention rolls around in 1980 and Reagan is basically expected to win the presidency by a landslide.
[01:37:26.004 --> 01:37:27.525]  And the media commentators began
[01:37:28.035 --> 01:37:39.748]  You know, talking up Gerald Ford as the Vice President and saying that Ford and Reagan would be the dream ticket, which would basically have been a split presidency because Ford would have chosen half of the Reagan cabinet.
[01:37:40.388 --> 01:37:40.789]  But then...
[01:37:41.463 --> 01:37:45.084]  And, I mean, this is all detailed in all these Associated Press articles that we've got.
[01:37:45.444 --> 01:38:00.346]  In a complete U-turn, basically, Reagan rushes to the convention floor late at night at the Republican Convention, breaks all precedence and says he wants to straighten out the rumours and gossip that Ford would be chosen to be the VP.
[01:38:01.107 --> 01:38:09.288]  And, um, Reagan goes and says he's changed his mind and recommends that George Bush be nominated for Vice President, his supposed arch-enemy.
[01:38:09.935 --> 01:38:13.577]  And so after that, you know, Reagan never again spoke out against the CFR.
[01:38:13.617 --> 01:38:21.342]  His cabinet was composed of 28 CFR members, 10 Bilderberg Group members, and 10 Trilateral Commission members.
[01:38:21.362 --> 01:38:26.505]  And Cleon Skousen was there and said that Reagan told him that he was threatened by Kissinger.
[01:38:27.926 --> 01:38:31.608]  Yeah, and obviously Kissinger's got the whole set, Bilderberg, CFR, Trilateral.
[01:38:32.428 --> 01:38:36.771]  James Baker, Bush's campaign manager, was appointed as Reagan's Chief of Staff.
[01:38:37.633 --> 01:38:44.995]  And after the assassination attempts on Reagan, which we can also talk about because there's literally hundreds of inconsistencies with that,
[01:38:45.643 --> 01:38:55.069]  Reagan goes ahead and invites a delegation of trilateralists to the White House two months after the assassination attempt, and that was reported in the Washington Post.
[01:38:55.390 --> 01:39:02.234]  Yeah, because at first Reagan really was talking about getting rid of the BATF, speaking out against the income tax.
[01:39:02.274 --> 01:39:04.476]  I mean, I've got the quotes, I've got the news articles.
[01:39:04.756 --> 01:39:07.898]  He totally shivs after that bullet goes into him.
[01:39:09.259 --> 01:39:11.540]  Exactly, and the assassination itself
[01:39:12.854 --> 01:39:20.257]  Before the assassination attempt, the Hinkley Oil Empire are tied in with contributions to George Bush, George Bush's campaign.
[01:39:20.277 --> 01:39:34.182]  There's an investigation into the Hinkley Oil Company, which was Vanderbilt Energy Corporation, which finds fraud and demands that they come up with answers within hours, and that was on the very day of the assassination attempt.
[01:39:35.482 --> 01:39:40.804]  As he mentioned, Neil Bush scheduled to have dinner with the Hinkley family on the night of the assassination attempt.
[01:39:41.690 --> 01:39:46.431]  At the very moment that the assassination attempt is taking place, Bush Sr.
[01:39:46.471 --> 01:39:49.852]  is on his way to speak with Trilateral Commission members.
[01:39:50.992 --> 01:40:00.674]  There's a strange transfer of executive power, basically a redefinition of the 25th Amendment, which... And General Alexander Haig freaks out and goes, I'm in command!
[01:40:00.714 --> 01:40:01.414]  I'm in control!
[01:40:02.194 --> 01:40:09.276]  Yeah, because it detailed, you know, what would happen if the President was disabled and they were changing it in the days before this shooting.
[01:40:10.532 --> 01:40:24.304]  And then the assassination attempt itself was just a distraction because NBC reported, a reporter called Judy Woodruff, said that she saw a secret service agent from the hotel above Reagan's living room.
[01:40:24.464 --> 01:40:25.165]  And she's now with CNN.
[01:40:25.285 --> 01:40:26.246]  She's now with CNN.
[01:40:27.947 --> 01:40:32.611]  So she said that the secret service agent above Reagan in the hotel fired the shot.
[01:40:34.469 --> 01:40:46.697]  Blatantly, he would have had a direct line of sight to shoot Reagan from above, from the hotel balcony, because Hinckley's supposed shot ricocheted off the limousine door before it hit Reagan.
[01:40:46.737 --> 01:40:49.339]  It's another one of those magic bullet scenarios.
[01:40:49.659 --> 01:41:03.688]  So it's more likely that the shot came from the Secret Service agent, and that's what... And then we have Hinckley's daddy, Hinckley Sr., running this world vision that's where the shooter emerges from to blast John Lennon.
[01:41:04.864 --> 01:41:05.484]  Well, exactly.
[01:41:06.125 --> 01:41:07.146]  John Hinckley Sr.
[01:41:07.166 --> 01:41:20.015]  was the president of World Vision, which basically came out as a CIA cover that produced mercenaries and assassins, and things like the Jonestown camp were later examples of how they tried to create that same thing.
[01:41:20.435 --> 01:41:23.117]  But John Lennon's killer, Mark David Chapman,
[01:41:23.638 --> 01:41:33.470]  Was involved with World Vision and it seems that the Lennon assassination was a dry run for the Reagan hit because both Mark David Chapman and John Hinckley Jr.
[01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:36.493]  were obsessed with the book by J.D.
[01:41:36.593 --> 01:41:42.300]  Salinger, Catcher in the Rye, which Chapman was found reading both before and after he shot Lennon.
[01:41:44.005 --> 01:41:50.446]  And then they grab him and take him to a Marine Corps base, which had had Senate hearings just years before as a major mind control center.
[01:41:50.746 --> 01:41:58.607]  It's like Jolly West, who was in the Senate hearings for being a mind control master, being the federally appointed psychiatrist for McVeigh.
[01:41:58.628 --> 01:42:01.268]  I mean, folks, it doesn't get any more ridiculous.
[01:42:01.288 --> 01:42:13.250]  And then I looked on the big genealogy website, genealogy.com, and not only were Bush and the Hinckley family intertwined in a business aspect, but
[01:42:14.202 --> 01:42:19.025]  This website lists them as interrelated, and that Bush and Hinkley were actually cousins.
[01:42:19.826 --> 01:42:20.627]  Big surprise.
[01:42:20.907 --> 01:42:21.807]  Oh, like Kerry!
[01:42:24.009 --> 01:42:26.831]  I tell you, it's just the same system over and over again.
[01:42:26.851 --> 01:42:29.392]  So we're not here bashing Ronald Reagan, folks.
[01:42:29.452 --> 01:42:32.234]  I mean, Ronald Reagan said he didn't like the Grove, so did Richard Nixon.
[01:42:32.775 --> 01:42:35.076]  But you cannot ignore what Nixon said about the Grove.
[01:42:35.116 --> 01:42:39.599]  And, by the way, can we post that clip in the Reagan News section, Paul?
[01:42:39.619 --> 01:42:41.981]  Can we take all these Reagan articles and put them in one section?
[01:42:42.558 --> 01:42:46.823]  Yeah, I'm going to build a section later on with all this information included.
[01:42:46.843 --> 01:42:51.128]  Yeah, we've got it all broken up all over the site in the last three days for folks, if you want it.
[01:42:51.308 --> 01:42:53.811]  Alright, let's shift gears.
[01:42:54.692 --> 01:42:59.117]  Every year we get some good info out of a Builderberg Group meeting that concluded two days ago.
[01:42:59.137 --> 01:43:00.519]  What have we got on that front?
[01:43:04.972 --> 01:43:12.554]  Well, we haven't got much because, basically, this year's Bilderberg Conference has to go down as, you know, one of the most censored out of the past five or so years.
[01:43:13.034 --> 01:43:20.615]  And that's because, as Jim Tucker reported, Bilderberg were apparently very angry at the extent of last year's coverage in France.
[01:43:20.655 --> 01:43:25.617]  And this year, they went to great lengths to prevent leaks of any kind.
[01:43:26.077 --> 01:43:32.118]  Which is why, you know, they were able to keep the location of the conference a secret right up until the last minute, basically.
[01:43:32.995 --> 01:43:41.487]  And so the secrecy this year compared to last year is clear, which you can see from the website of the Bilderberg Archive last year's meeting in France.
[01:43:42.071 --> 01:43:54.355]  We got dozens of photographs of the members arriving and leaving, people like, you know, Pearl Kissinger, and dozens of mainstream media reports, many of which were actually good investigative pieces.
[01:43:55.035 --> 01:43:59.197]  But this year we have just a handful and, you know, one photo of Henry Kissinger.
[01:43:59.757 --> 01:44:06.659]  Now we do have the guy that will probably end up being Kerry's VP running, mate, being inspected at this year's meeting.
[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:09.800]  Exactly, and that's John Edwards.
[01:44:10.241 --> 01:44:11.581]  UPI reported today that
[01:44:12.552 --> 01:44:16.837]  Senator Edwards, who is likely to be Kerry's running mate, was in attendance.
[01:44:16.877 --> 01:44:29.069]  So along with John Kerry's closer genetic connections to European royal families, it's looking increasingly likely that it's going to be President Kerry in November.
[01:44:29.089 --> 01:44:35.156]  That's a major indicator because they'll normally have the VP running mate there getting his orders beforehand.
[01:44:36.166 --> 01:44:36.787]  Well, exactly.
[01:44:36.807 --> 01:44:43.831]  And again, every president since Washington, the one with the closer connections to the royal family, is elected.
[01:44:44.592 --> 01:44:56.980]  But apart from that, with Bilderberg, the only mainstream reports that there were, were mainly derogatory towards anyone that, you know, believes Bilderberg has any influence over world policy making.
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.723]  Well, you know, I was talking to an actual British TV station this morning that had me consulting for them.
[01:45:02.887 --> 01:45:07.130]  Well, I said, you know, when one Hollywood star goes out for a swim, there's paparazzi.
[01:45:07.170 --> 01:45:07.690]  Yes, yes.
[01:45:08.110 --> 01:45:10.052]  Well, they're always following the queen around, right?
[01:45:10.092 --> 01:45:10.412]  Yes.
[01:45:10.972 --> 01:45:16.696]  Well, you have 200 royal and rich people in the world, and even some Hollywood people.
[01:45:18.522 --> 01:45:24.567]  You know, showing up Steven Spielberg at this meeting, but then the BBC says you're bad if you talk about it.
[01:45:25.607 --> 01:45:27.229]  And they said, you know, that makes a lot of sense.
[01:45:27.249 --> 01:45:28.510]  You know, this should be covered.
[01:45:28.890 --> 01:45:32.432]  But no, the BBC says that it's secretly racist.
[01:45:33.393 --> 01:45:37.476]  It actually says you're with Bin Laden, you're with McVeigh, if you think it has power.
[01:45:37.756 --> 01:45:39.618]  So you shouldn't want to investigate power, Paul.
[01:45:40.498 --> 01:46:00.429]  No, the quote, the exact quote is, in Yugoslavia, leading Serbs have blamed Bilderberg for triggering the war which led to the downfall of Milosevic, the Oklahoma City bomber, Timothy McVeigh, the London Nail bomber, David Copeland, and Osama Bin Laden are all said to have bought into the theory that Bilderberg pulls the strings with which national governments dance.
[01:46:01.289 --> 01:46:10.635]  And then from this I noticed that the other mainstream reports that came out subsequently just parroted the line that anyone that questions Bilderberg is with the terrorists.
[01:46:11.156 --> 01:46:14.638]  Furthermore, you know, they use the old anti-Semitic attack.
[01:46:14.698 --> 01:46:20.162]  So again, if you think 120 world leaders meeting in secret is interesting, then you're a racist!
[01:46:20.931 --> 01:46:35.644]  And it's a shame that the writer of the BBC hit piece doesn't, you know, keep up to tabs with his colleagues at the BBC, because during last year's conference in France, when we got this MP3 file on prisonplanet.com in the Bilderberg section,
[01:46:36.443 --> 01:46:48.556]  The BBC journalist had access to the Bilderberg archives and they discovered that Bilderberg called for the creation of the European Union years before it came into existence in the early fifties.
[01:46:48.576 --> 01:46:58.386]  So I guess those journalists reading from Bilderberg's own archive documents are terrorists and racists for pointing out that, you know, yes indeed Bilderberg does shape the course of
[01:47:01.249 --> 01:47:06.275]  All right, I want to hit a few other articles here, then we'll come back and take some calls, and there's a lot more in the third hour.
[01:47:06.675 --> 01:47:09.859]  We'll get into Bush's erratic behavior, worries, White House aides.
[01:47:09.879 --> 01:47:11.280]  This is from Capitol Hill Blue, folks.
[01:47:11.741 --> 01:47:12.762]  But first this.
[01:47:13.123 --> 01:47:14.704]  Taliban told U.S.
[01:47:14.804 --> 01:47:16.306]  it would give up Osama.
[01:47:16.346 --> 01:47:19.390]  Now, we already knew this, but now this is out of Reuters.
[01:47:19.870 --> 01:47:25.272]  They offered to arrest Bin Laden so they could get cruise missiles, just like Sudan, and then that dovetails with U.S.
[01:47:25.312 --> 01:47:29.213]  told Saudis to let Al-Qaeda government escape, this out of the Scotsman.
[01:47:30.033 --> 01:47:32.434]  In every case, Taliban told U.S.
[01:47:32.454 --> 01:47:33.574]  it would give up Osama.
[01:47:34.314 --> 01:47:44.217]  United States and Taliban officials met secretly in Frankfurt almost a year before September 11th attacks to discuss terms of the Afghans to hand over Osama Bin Laden according to the German television documentary.
[01:47:44.577 --> 01:47:45.217]  But the U.S.
[01:47:45.257 --> 01:47:46.317]  didn't want him.
[01:47:46.798 --> 01:47:47.418]  Same thing.
[01:47:48.951 --> 01:47:49.991]  It never ends, Paul!
[01:47:51.032 --> 01:47:59.495]  Well, exactly, and in Order Out of Chaos I go into detail about the numerous attempts from different countries to track down and hand over Bin Laden.
[01:47:59.895 --> 01:48:03.497]  I believe, you know, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia also tried the same thing.
[01:48:04.281 --> 01:48:08.005]  And obviously the Taliban were willing to negotiate with the U.S.
[01:48:08.025 --> 01:48:10.989]  Yeah, these Arab countries are going, please, please don't take us over.
[01:48:11.029 --> 01:48:11.690]  We'll do whatever.
[01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:12.691]  We'll work with you.
[01:48:13.211 --> 01:48:14.453]  We know you've got the power.
[01:48:14.793 --> 01:48:16.775]  Why would Arabs blow up buildings, folks?
[01:48:17.256 --> 01:48:19.018]  No, as usual, just like with the Hinckleys.
[01:48:19.685 --> 01:48:21.505]  Bin Laden's are admitted business partners.
[01:48:21.946 --> 01:48:27.367]  Vacationing, living in Lubbock, hanging out with them, living together in Saudi Arabia.
[01:48:27.787 --> 01:48:30.008]  I mean, these are FBI agents telling you this.
[01:48:30.788 --> 01:48:32.788]  This is a Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
[01:48:33.768 --> 01:48:46.932]  Truth is stranger than fiction, and the only Taliban leader to actually be held was the religious leader, who two weeks before, this is BBC, sent a communique to Bush giving him specific details, saying, why aren't you going to stop this?
[01:48:47.352 --> 01:48:48.352]  He was waiting
[01:48:49.162 --> 01:48:56.272]  When the liberation took place, supposedly, they're happily, you know, and the general was ordered to arrest him and he's still in custody.
[01:48:56.533 --> 01:49:01.640]  So the Taliban that warned us that they didn't flee, that was waiting there, they're the ones that get arrested.
[01:49:02.982 --> 01:49:04.023]  What was the quote?
[01:49:05.024 --> 01:49:11.449]  They had to accept a carpet of gold or a carpet of bombs because they were holding out against putting the oil pipeline through.
[01:49:11.910 --> 01:49:30.685]  So, I mean, they were willing to negotiate but, you know, by the time it reached July 2001, where then the CIA directly went to Bin Laden in the United Arab Emirates, which was in the Washington Times to have a little, you know, confab with him, by that point all negotiations were off and, you know, the attack was being prepared.
[01:49:32.071 --> 01:49:33.131]  That's right, folks.
[01:49:33.571 --> 01:49:35.332]  Bin Laden dies of kidney failure.
[01:49:35.372 --> 01:49:36.232]  The deal's made.
[01:49:36.272 --> 01:49:39.233]  His body's frozen, ready to be brought out before the election.
[01:49:39.253 --> 01:49:42.254]  But we may have stopped that because of exposing him.
[01:49:43.114 --> 01:49:50.717]  Well, Iranian state radio reported in February that they had already captured Bin Laden and had him on ice.
[01:49:51.017 --> 01:49:52.737]  So we're talking four months ago.
[01:49:53.738 --> 01:49:58.039]  But it was over two years ago that I broke the news of what the White House source told me.
[01:49:58.909 --> 01:50:09.598]  Yeah, so it's anything from, you know, at least four months to two years ago in which they've had him captured, all the while these tapes come out, audio and video tapes, which are later proven to be complete frauds.
[01:50:10.298 --> 01:50:20.706]  And so, there was an article in the BBC on Friday where Rumsfeld's wife jokingly mocks him every morning for not catching Bin Laden, and it was a big joke.
[01:50:20.766 --> 01:50:25.030]  So, I don't know, maybe they're preparing for it in the next few months before the election, maybe
[01:50:25.735 --> 01:50:28.676]  Um, you know, due to the fact that we've blown the whistle on it.
[01:50:28.756 --> 01:50:34.778]  I mean, you had Brian Lamb on C-SPAN, you know, talking about, oh, staged imminent capture of Bin Laden.
[01:50:34.858 --> 01:50:37.820]  Maybe we've backed them off and then they may try something else.
[01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:39.580]  Yeah, Brian Lamb attacking me.
[01:50:40.941 --> 01:50:42.741]  All right, we'll break, come back, take some calls.
[01:50:42.761 --> 01:50:44.062]  There's so much other news.
[01:50:44.622 --> 01:50:47.283]  Bush throwing, tensor tantrums in the White House.
[01:50:48.003 --> 01:50:48.904]  Very, very serious.
[01:50:48.924 --> 01:50:49.544]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:53.524 --> 01:50:57.866]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:58.046 --> 01:51:02.409]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:51:04.909 --> 01:51:07.030]  This disaster is a New World Order.
[01:51:07.110 --> 01:51:08.471]  A New World Order?
[01:51:09.151 --> 01:51:09.891]  Hannah Murray.
[01:51:10.171 --> 01:51:14.393]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.

[01:54:06.700 --> 01:54:11.364]  We're about to go to JR and Roger and Chris and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:54:12.124 --> 01:54:22.193]  Paul, you had a chance to hear me on National British Radio this weekend, and you noticed some of the callers were like, everything you're saying is a lie, it's all your opinion, shut up!
[01:54:23.374 --> 01:54:27.538]  And the other times it came on, I didn't get that much heat, I guess, but a few of the callers did disagree.
[01:54:28.622 --> 01:54:32.826]  Basically because they were screening for them, which is fine, but you notice they never have facts.
[01:54:32.886 --> 01:54:34.267]  It's all emotion, Paul.
[01:54:35.288 --> 01:54:43.915]  It's all emotion, and it's 95% of these people can't string two sentences together, so you know, you know, there's no real challenge.
[01:54:44.335 --> 01:54:47.338]  That's the only argument that they can reside with.
[01:54:47.418 --> 01:54:48.939]  It's, you know, it's your opinion.
[01:54:48.999 --> 01:54:51.862]  It's this whole moral relativism argument because
[01:54:52.495 --> 01:55:09.240]  If we're swimming in a sea of opinions, then everybody's right, but all you have to point out to these people is that it's their opinion that it's your opinion, but you've got the facts, you've got the documents, and we spend hours every day exhaustively documenting everything we say.
[01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:14.842]  Well, yeah, I mean, I'll say to them, so if I come over and stab you, that's okay?
[01:55:15.242 --> 01:55:16.182]  Well, no, of course not!
[01:55:16.642 --> 01:55:23.308]  You know, I'll talk mad about the Aztecs who sacrifice tens of thousands of people every year and someone will call in and go, that's their culture!
[01:55:23.709 --> 01:55:26.632]  Not gonna rule the Nazis out of culture of killing people, is that okay?
[01:55:26.812 --> 01:55:27.813]  Well, of course not!
[01:55:28.453 --> 01:55:30.876]  So see, your moral relativism doesn't work, people!
[01:55:31.096 --> 01:55:33.258]  It's only meant to neutralize your arguments!
[01:55:33.558 --> 01:55:35.160]  Now let's talk to JR in Texas.
[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:36.761]  JR, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:55:38.703 --> 01:55:39.484]  Hello, JR.
[01:55:40.370 --> 01:55:40.610]  Hello?
[01:55:40.890 --> 01:55:41.190]  Yes!
[01:55:41.511 --> 01:55:41.951]  Oh, yes sir.
[01:55:42.351 --> 01:55:44.092]  Um, I have a couple of questions for you, Alex.
[01:55:44.312 --> 01:55:44.592]  Yes!
[01:55:45.072 --> 01:56:02.001]  Uh, the first one is, um, I wanted to ask you if you had any advice for, um, for us struggling small business owners that, uh, you know, they're trying to get our business, uh, up off the ground and, uh, everything just seems to be heading downhill from here.
[01:56:02.141 --> 01:56:09.105]  And, you know, with this, uh, impending terrorist attack that's going to most likely happen before the election coming up, it's just, uh,
[01:56:09.758 --> 01:56:15.221]  I wanted to ask you if you had any advice.
[01:56:15.301 --> 01:56:20.004]  Personally, I'm no business whiz-bang expert, but I know this.
[01:56:20.064 --> 01:56:22.345]  The real economic numbers are very bad.
[01:56:22.945 --> 01:56:24.706]  They're telling us, ooh, a million new jobs.
[01:56:24.746 --> 01:56:27.468]  Well, that's people getting a second job, a third job.
[01:56:27.908 --> 01:56:30.489]  It's millions of people going off the unemployment rolls.
[01:56:30.910 --> 01:56:33.051]  Then that's counted as someone who's not unemployed.
[01:56:33.815 --> 01:56:40.438]  I mean, the President's Economic Commission told us three months ago that fast food jobs are industrial.
[01:56:40.899 --> 01:56:48.482]  He said that importing jobs overseas, or exporting jobs overseas, is our greatest asset and needs to be accelerated.
[01:56:48.982 --> 01:56:54.385]  They say that layoffs of high-tech workers are going to get seven times worse in the next four years.
[01:56:54.685 --> 01:56:55.886]  Congressional Budget Office.
[01:56:56.386 --> 01:56:57.987]  Debt's at an all-time high.
[01:56:58.108 --> 01:56:59.509]  Energy prices are exploding.
[01:56:59.829 --> 01:57:04.333]  Every time energy prices explode in the last hundred years, we have a major recession or depression.
[01:57:04.553 --> 01:57:09.116]  So all I see is bad numbers, but meanwhile they're saying, go in more debt, go in more debt, everything.
[01:57:09.156 --> 01:57:10.137]  Paul, you got any comments?
[01:57:10.758 --> 01:57:21.006]  Yeah, well, Hannity was on the air on Friday saying that the economy is improving in leaps and bounds, and he drew reference to all the editorials that are putting out in, you know, the Washington
[01:57:21.471 --> 01:57:26.652]  Post New York Times that are saying that the economy is getting better when that, you know, contrasts with the reality.
[01:57:26.672 --> 01:57:33.333]  This is the same supposed liberal New York Times that said, oh yeah, Niger uranium, mobile weapons trucks, aluminum tubes.
[01:57:33.553 --> 01:57:35.474]  The liberals lying for Bush!
[01:57:36.254 --> 01:57:37.754]  You're so liberal.
[01:57:37.794 --> 01:57:38.174]  Go ahead.
[01:57:38.334 --> 01:57:39.234]  Oh yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:57:39.294 --> 01:57:48.196]  My next question, Alex, was what are your thoughts on rebuilding the World Trade Center and what's going on at Ground Zero regarding the rebuilding process?
[01:57:48.952 --> 01:57:50.533]  I mean, it's already been decided.
[01:57:50.553 --> 01:57:56.015]  I mean, I think, you know... Would you support rebuilding the Twin Towers for the next millennium?
[01:57:56.055 --> 01:57:56.735]  For the new millennium?
[01:57:57.075 --> 01:57:59.957]  You know, I don't... Frankly, I don't even think it matters that much.
[01:57:59.997 --> 01:58:02.197]  I think it should be up to the people of New York.
[01:58:02.418 --> 01:58:03.838]  Of course, they're not being listened to.
[01:58:04.278 --> 01:58:07.860]  In major polls, the people didn't want it rebuilt, and the government said, yeah, so what?
[01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:10.321]  We're going to build this new giant One Tower.
[01:58:10.681 --> 01:58:11.021]  Yeah.
[01:58:11.641 --> 01:58:14.202]  Well, I have an important announcement to make regarding Ground Zero.
[01:58:14.522 --> 01:58:18.264]  This July 4th, in the morning, around noontime,
[01:58:19.146 --> 01:58:27.329]  There will be a press conference and a protest rally at Ground Zero, sponsored by Team Twin Towers and the World Trade Center Restoration Movement.
[01:58:27.749 --> 01:58:30.289]  For more information, go to TeamTwinTowers.org.
[01:58:30.770 --> 01:58:33.750]  And if you're in the area, please drop by and support the rebuilding process.
[01:58:34.411 --> 01:58:36.031]  Okay, so you guys want to rebuild it then?
[01:58:36.291 --> 01:58:37.051]  Yeah, the Twin Towers.
[01:58:37.611 --> 01:58:39.092]  What they're going to do has already been decided.
[01:58:39.572 --> 01:58:41.433]  Well, yeah, but they don't have money to do it.
[01:58:41.453 --> 01:58:41.973]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:41.993 --> 01:58:42.553]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:45.069 --> 01:58:49.572]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:58:49.913 --> 01:58:54.016]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:58:54.296 --> 01:58:54.856]  We listened.
[01:58:55.157 --> 01:59:00.140]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:59:00.421 --> 01:59:00.901]  We listened.
[01:59:01.281 --> 01:59:04.323]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:59:04.744 --> 01:59:05.284]  We listened.
[01:59:05.765 --> 01:59:08.907]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[01:59:09.127 --> 01:59:09.447]  I don't know.
[01:59:35.652 --> 01:59:36.672]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[01:59:36.892 --> 01:59:38.973]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:59:39.033 --> 01:59:39.633]  Big Brother.
[01:59:39.653 --> 01:59:41.534]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:41.834 --> 01:59:46.355]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:46.415 --> 01:59:47.375]  You want answers?
[01:59:47.515 --> 01:59:49.056]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.814 --> 02:00:01.798]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.019 --> 02:00:06.143]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:06.223 --> 02:00:12.389]  Oh my goodness, today has just blasted past us.
[02:00:12.650 --> 02:00:16.353]  We're already into the third hour of this Monday, June 7, 2004 edition.
[02:00:18.877 --> 02:00:31.865]  And always on Monday or Tuesday, at least one day a week, Paul Watson, my webmaster for my websites PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv joins us on air with all of his great expertise and investigative talents.
[02:00:32.485 --> 02:00:33.846]  I know we've got loaded phone lines.
[02:00:33.906 --> 02:00:39.049]  We will get to your calls as well from Hawaii to Colorado here in just a moment.
[02:00:39.569 --> 02:00:42.931]  Paul, what are some of the other things you want to cover in the next hour after we take some calls?
[02:00:44.016 --> 02:00:50.358]  Basically, the only other thing is the fact that Total Information Awareness, which was supposedly killed in Congress... Never killed!
[02:00:50.918 --> 02:00:56.721]  ...is operational, and now we know the exact building and address where it's running out of, so we can go into that later on.
[02:00:56.961 --> 02:00:58.521]  That's another Capitol Hill Blue story.
[02:00:58.561 --> 02:01:03.463]  They've got another one about Bush and his bizarre behavior.
[02:01:04.043 --> 02:01:06.924]  And Capitol Hill Blue folks did some of the best reporting on Clinton.
[02:01:07.204 --> 02:01:12.086]  They're not some liberal group, you know, trying to get our gracious conservative leader
[02:01:12.935 --> 02:01:17.122]  You know, I'm sure we'll be told he's the most conservative leader ever in a few decades.
[02:01:17.603 --> 02:01:21.991]  So we'll get into that, also a bunch of other 9-11 news, and I'll go back into Ronald Reagan.
[02:01:22.692 --> 02:01:24.976]  Let's go ahead and talk to Roger in Colorado.
[02:01:25.036 --> 02:01:25.798]  Roger, go ahead.
[02:01:27.324 --> 02:01:28.765]  Yeah, Alex, thanks for having me on.
[02:01:28.785 --> 02:01:30.666]  This is Roger Easley up in Central Colorado.
[02:01:30.886 --> 02:01:31.166]  Uh-huh.
[02:01:31.407 --> 02:01:35.869]  And, you know, I've actually, I've been promoting honest government for about 25 years.
[02:01:35.909 --> 02:01:45.836]  A friend of mine turned me on to you about two years ago, and since then I've given away dozens of tapes to local police, mayor, council members, and so on, and it's really been an effective tool.
[02:01:45.856 --> 02:01:46.716]  I want to thank you for that.
[02:01:46.736 --> 02:01:47.817]  Thank you!
[02:01:48.177 --> 02:01:55.562]  The reason I'm calling you today, though, is to let you know I'm running for the House of Representatives, and today is the first day I'm actually launching my campaign.
[02:01:56.198 --> 02:01:57.840]  I'm going to be on the road.
[02:01:57.900 --> 02:02:03.346]  I've got Infowars.com on both sides of my RV, along with a few other things.
[02:02:05.048 --> 02:02:06.589]  I just thought I'd share that with you.
[02:02:06.629 --> 02:02:13.837]  A friend of mine is going to let me get a photograph, and I'm going to email that to you later so you can see what it looks like when it's going down the road.
[02:02:15.083 --> 02:02:18.584]  And for anyone in Central Colorado, I'm running for District 60.
[02:02:19.124 --> 02:02:34.629]  And anyone that would like to join me or would like some assistance to help take back their own communities, to organize, to maybe run for town council in their own towns and counties and so on, they can contact me at EasleyForLiberty at Juno.com.
[02:02:34.949 --> 02:02:36.810]  And I'm going to be on the road for the next five months.
[02:02:37.170 --> 02:02:38.470]  I've got Matrix on board.
[02:02:40.536 --> 02:02:46.521]  And I intend to be showing it at community centers, police departments, and anywhere else where I can get it into their VCR.
[02:02:46.961 --> 02:02:48.722]  And that's my documentary, Matrix of Evil.
[02:02:48.782 --> 02:02:49.703]  Well, that's exciting!
[02:02:50.023 --> 02:02:51.544]  It's actually one of the best.
[02:02:51.604 --> 02:02:56.128]  Rocky Mountain News has a questionnaire for candidates, and they ask me what my favorite movie is.
[02:02:56.188 --> 02:03:02.032]  And to be honest, Alex, I put Masters of Terror, because I just like that movie better than anything I've ever seen.
[02:03:02.132 --> 02:03:04.494]  Okay, so you're running for what in Colorado?
[02:03:04.654 --> 02:03:07.156]  I'm running for the State House of Representatives, District 60.
[02:03:07.976 --> 02:03:08.936]  Okay, well that's great.
[02:03:09.437 --> 02:03:11.157]  And your name is Roger Easley?
[02:03:11.337 --> 02:03:11.897]  Yes it is.
[02:03:11.917 --> 02:03:15.679]  And that's Easley for Liberty, if anyone would like more info.
[02:03:15.899 --> 02:03:17.719]  Okay, thank you for the call and keep it up.
[02:03:18.159 --> 02:03:22.821]  Paul, that's a great way to inform people is to run for state and local government, is it not?
[02:03:23.763 --> 02:03:26.305]  Yeah, because then you can change it on a local level.
[02:03:26.705 --> 02:03:37.192]  There are numerous movements afoot to, you know, migrate mass amounts of people to certain states, and that's a big undertaking, but on an individual level, then people can run for government.
[02:03:37.212 --> 02:03:48.259]  I mean, obviously we'd do that kind of thing if we weren't buried under all this news, so we're kind of the foot soldiers that arm people with the information, and then they go out and, you know, run for office and try and change things on a local level.
[02:03:49.753 --> 02:03:51.395]  That's the bottom line, my friends.
[02:03:51.435 --> 02:04:00.963]  But I do want to hear from the listeners on the Reagan situation, the attempted assassination by the Globalist, Reagan dead at 93, but we're going back to 1981 and before.
[02:04:01.604 --> 02:04:06.168]  We're talking about Bush and his deteriorating psychological activities.
[02:04:07.089 --> 02:04:11.593]  We're talking about a whole host of issues, and when we get back from break, we will get into that.
[02:04:11.673 --> 02:04:14.956]  But I tell you, Paul, that there's a lot to this.
[02:04:16.279 --> 02:04:17.180]  There's a lot to this.
[02:04:17.260 --> 02:04:20.101]  Bush's erratic behavior worries White House aides.
[02:04:20.921 --> 02:04:27.564]  And they're saying that he actually fired the CIA director, and we'll get into that.
[02:04:27.925 --> 02:04:31.266]  Also, there's Coca-Cola summer police state propaganda.
[02:04:31.286 --> 02:04:36.088]  We're going to play the audio from this TV ad as well when we get back after some more calls.
[02:04:36.449 --> 02:04:37.169]  So stay with us.
[02:04:37.209 --> 02:04:43.052]  The websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:04:47.739 --> 02:04:53.223]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:04:53.643 --> 02:04:57.886]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:04:58.126 --> 02:05:05.151]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:05:05.532 --> 02:05:11.656]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:05:11.796 --> 02:05:12.997]  There are no side effects.
[02:05:13.337 --> 02:05:16.299]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:05:16.439 --> 02:05:18.460]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:26.004]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:05:26.304 --> 02:05:29.686]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:05:30.126 --> 02:05:34.771]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time that's 866-885-6625 call today!
[02:05:45.023 --> 02:05:51.886]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:05:52.166 --> 02:05:53.566]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:05:53.746 --> 02:05:55.947]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:05:56.107 --> 02:05:58.188]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:05:58.468 --> 02:06:03.410]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:06:03.730 --> 02:06:07.772]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:06:08.032 --> 02:06:09.793]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:06:09.873 --> 02:06:20.520]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:06:20.680 --> 02:06:22.581]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:07:46.543 --> 02:07:52.585]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:07:53.185 --> 02:07:56.186]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:02.378 --> 02:08:04.140]  This is from Capitol Hill Blue.
[02:08:05.321 --> 02:08:08.804]  Bush's erratic behavior worries White House aides.
[02:08:09.525 --> 02:08:13.469]  President George W. Bush's increasingly erratic behavior and wide mood swings.
[02:08:14.301 --> 02:08:33.387]  As the holes in the West Wing buzzing lately, as his aides privately express growing concern over their leadership of mine, in meetings with top aides, administration officials, the President goes from quoting the Bible, which he does to manipulate people, into one breath to obscene tantrums against the media, Democrats, and others that he classifies as enemies of the state.
[02:08:34.099 --> 02:08:43.642]  Worried White House aides paint a portrait of a man on the edge, increasingly wary of those who disagree with him, and paranoid of public that no longer trusts his policies in Iraq or at home.
[02:08:44.142 --> 02:08:49.264]  It reminds me of Nixon days, says longtime GOP political consultant with contacts in the White House.
[02:08:49.364 --> 02:08:50.324]  Everybody is an enemy.
[02:08:50.724 --> 02:08:51.924]  Everybody is out to get him.
[02:08:52.084 --> 02:08:53.145]  That's the mood over there.
[02:08:54.005 --> 02:09:00.967]  In interviews with a number of White House staffers who were willing to talk off the record, a picture of an administration under siege has emerged.
[02:09:01.930 --> 02:09:05.774]  Led by a man who declares his decisions to be the will of God, but who's God?
[02:09:06.295 --> 02:09:15.565]  And that tells age 2, can't say it folks, anyone, let's say a crush, anyone they consider to be an opponent of the administration.
[02:09:16.112 --> 02:09:17.493]  We're at war, there's no doubt about it.
[02:09:17.893 --> 02:09:21.857]  What I don't know anymore is just who the enemy might be, says the troubled White House aide.
[02:09:22.297 --> 02:09:30.263]  We seem to spend more time trying to destroy John Kerry and Al Qaeda, both your cousins and business partners, and our enemies list just keeps growing and growing.
[02:09:30.283 --> 02:09:31.264]  It's just kind of disinfo.
[02:09:31.724 --> 02:09:37.929]  Aides say the President gets up, hung up on minor details, micromanaging to the extreme while ignoring the bigger picture.
[02:09:38.249 --> 02:09:45.135]  He will spend hours personally reviewing and approving every attack ad against the Democrats' opponent and then forget
[02:09:46.183 --> 02:09:47.964]  A meeting on economic issues.
[02:09:48.084 --> 02:09:51.285]  This is what is killing us on Iraq, one aide said.
[02:09:51.605 --> 02:09:52.425]  We've lost focus.
[02:09:52.465 --> 02:09:56.707]  The President got hung up on the weapons of mass destruction and an unproven link to Al-Qaeda.
[02:09:57.447 --> 02:10:03.289]  We could have found other justifiable reasons for the war, but the President insisted the focus stay on those two tenuous items.
[02:10:03.969 --> 02:10:06.370]  Aides who raise questions quickly find themselves shut.
[02:10:07.233 --> 02:10:12.218]  Out of access to the President or other top advisors among top officials, Bush's inner circle is shrinking.
[02:10:12.658 --> 02:10:17.563]  Secretary of State Colin Powell has fallen out of favor because of his growing doubts about the administration's war in Iraq.
[02:10:17.983 --> 02:10:20.065]  Now that's just so he can come out later and agree with them.
[02:10:20.105 --> 02:10:21.306]  And oh look, even he agrees.
[02:10:21.847 --> 02:10:27.432]  The President's abrupt dismissal of CIA Director George Tenet Wednesday night is, I'd say, an example of how he works.
[02:10:27.592 --> 02:10:29.114]  Tenet wanted to quit last year.
[02:10:29.986 --> 02:10:32.408]  But the President got his back up and wouldn't hear of it.
[02:10:32.668 --> 02:10:36.071]  Says an aide, that would have been the appropriate time to make the change.
[02:10:36.151 --> 02:10:46.739]  Now in the middle of the election campaign, but with the Director challenged the President during the meeting Wednesday, the President cut him off saying, that's it George, I cannot abide disloyalty.
[02:10:46.839 --> 02:10:48.420]  I want your resignation and I want it now.
[02:10:48.901 --> 02:10:53.024]  Then it was allowed to resign voluntarily and Bush informed his shock staff that the decision.
[02:10:53.344 --> 02:10:57.627]  Thursday morning, 1-8 says the President actually described the decision as God's will.
[02:10:58.028 --> 02:10:59.689]  And it was Bush that announced it, folks.
[02:11:00.302 --> 02:11:10.486]  God may also be the reason turning General John Ashcroft, the administration's lightning rod, because of his questionable actions that critics argue threatens freedoms granted by the Constitution, remains part of the power elite.
[02:11:10.847 --> 02:11:15.809]  West Wing staffers call Bush and Ashcroft the Blues Brother because they're on a mission from God.
[02:11:15.849 --> 02:11:16.649]  Yeah, from Moloch.
[02:11:17.307 --> 02:11:20.309]  The Attorney General is tight with the President because of religion, says one aide.
[02:11:20.530 --> 02:11:22.851]  They both believe any action is justifiable in the name of God.
[02:11:23.232 --> 02:11:32.299]  But the President, who says he rules at the best of God, also tongue-lashes those who perceive his disloyal, calling them bleeper, bleeper, bleepers.
[02:11:32.939 --> 02:11:40.444]  In front of other staff members, berating one cabinet official in front of others, labeling anyone who disagrees with him unpatriotic or anti-American.
[02:11:40.824 --> 02:11:42.865]  The mood here is that we're under siege.
[02:11:42.925 --> 02:11:47.108]  There's no doubt about it, says a one-troubled aide who admits he is looking for work elsewhere.
[02:11:47.528 --> 02:11:52.110]  In this administration, you don't have to wear a turban or speak Farsi to be an enemy of the United States.
[02:11:52.471 --> 02:11:55.532]  All you have to do is disagree with the President.
[02:11:56.333 --> 02:11:59.595]  The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the record.
[02:12:00.215 --> 02:12:01.216]  Paul Watson comments.
[02:12:02.057 --> 02:12:16.779]  Well, I mean, again, we were out ahead of this story at least a couple of months ago because we picked up what TBR News were reporting, which is more in-depth than what Capitol Hill Blue were reporting, which is kind of a watered-down version.
[02:12:17.341 --> 02:12:31.413]  That Bush has basically gone on the warpath, and you'll remember that O'Neill, the former Treasury Secretary, when he resigned he said that Bush conducted cabinet meetings like a deaf and blind man.
[02:12:31.453 --> 02:12:35.436]  He basically just sits there, he doesn't even speak, he's given orders.
[02:12:37.577 --> 02:12:41.978]  You know, it's basically... I'm stuttering.
[02:12:42.018 --> 02:12:51.940]  His first meeting in the White House, the first time he was in there, O'Neal, they had maps of who got the oil, and how they were going to attack Saddam, and how they needed terror attacks.
[02:12:52.380 --> 02:12:54.180]  But forget O'Neal, forget Clark.
[02:12:54.260 --> 02:12:55.561]  That's not spilt milk, folks.
[02:12:55.821 --> 02:12:58.761]  We have Peanack's own document saying all this, by Dick Cheney.
[02:12:58.781 --> 02:12:59.101]  Go ahead.
[02:13:00.302 --> 02:13:02.442]  Yeah, Bush's first meeting, as I recall.
[02:13:03.283 --> 02:13:05.944]  Wasn't it with all the big oil industry executives?
[02:13:05.964 --> 02:13:07.745]  They were basically giving him his orders.
[02:13:07.785 --> 02:13:10.126]  It was his very first meeting after he became president.
[02:13:10.206 --> 02:13:12.307]  And O'Neill's sitting there watching all of this!
[02:13:13.527 --> 02:13:18.350]  Yes, I mean, tying this into the resignations or the firing of Tenner.
[02:13:19.030 --> 02:13:19.950]  We got word of that.
[02:13:19.990 --> 02:13:26.833]  Again, we're not bragging, but we just get ahead of the news each time that at least two, three weeks ago... Yeah, we had articles posted.
[02:13:27.313 --> 02:13:30.875]  ...that there would be a series of high-profile resignations
[02:13:31.431 --> 02:13:34.693]  Including Armitage, Powell, Tenet and Sanchez.
[02:13:34.753 --> 02:13:38.514]  Now, Tenet and Sanchez, the military commander in Iraq, have already gone.
[02:13:39.055 --> 02:13:52.561]  So, you know, look out for Armitage and Powell to be next, because it seems that there's this inner faction within the Bush administration that is seeking to basically get rid of Bush and the Bush faction within that administration.
[02:13:52.601 --> 02:13:56.663]  Yeah, we have skull and bones, intelligence arms, fighting with each other.
[02:13:57.203 --> 02:13:57.643]  Exactly.
[02:13:57.684 --> 02:13:59.325]  It's like the Mafia do the same thing.
[02:13:59.405 --> 02:14:13.134]  So it appears to be that they're hanging Bush out to dry, which is what happened in that awful press conference in early April where he stuttered and stammered for at least, you know, a minute waiting for something to pop into his ear.
[02:14:13.334 --> 02:14:14.575]  And he said, in fact, we ought to...
[02:14:15.566 --> 02:14:18.687]  You know what, we had all that in the computer and somehow it got a race poll.
[02:14:19.067 --> 02:14:24.929]  But I know we have the clips on the website and we have the transcript where he literally goes, oh, I'm waiting for it to pop in my ear.
[02:14:25.009 --> 02:14:25.489]  Where is it?
[02:14:25.649 --> 02:14:26.950]  I'm just waiting for it.
[02:14:27.910 --> 02:14:29.591]  You should have given me this in writing beforehand.
[02:14:29.791 --> 02:14:32.812]  I mean, literally, folks.
[02:14:33.112 --> 02:14:36.973]  I mean... I can try it over the computer.
[02:14:37.033 --> 02:14:38.334]  It might not come across as well.
[02:14:38.974 --> 02:14:40.194]  Yeah, put the phone right up to it.
[02:14:40.854 --> 02:14:41.815]  We don't have time to download.
[02:14:41.875 --> 02:14:42.715]  Do you have that in front of you?
[02:14:44.173 --> 02:14:45.694]  It's just loaded up now.
[02:14:45.894 --> 02:14:46.594]  Yeah, let me hear this.
[02:14:46.874 --> 02:14:47.334]  Crank it up.
[02:14:48.395 --> 02:14:50.435]  This is Lord Bush, press conference, live.
[02:14:53.397 --> 02:14:54.237]  It is loading up.
[02:14:54.657 --> 02:14:55.857]  Go ahead.
[02:14:55.877 --> 02:14:56.578]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[02:14:57.358 --> 02:15:03.560]  In the last campaign, you asked a question about the biggest mistake you've made in your life, and you used to like to joke that it was trading Sammy Sosa.
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:08.262]  You've looked back before 9-11 for what mistakes might have been made after 9-11.
[02:15:09.302 --> 02:15:12.864]  What would your biggest mistake be, would you say, and what lessons have you learned from it?
[02:15:14.235 --> 02:15:18.417]  I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I could plan for it.
[02:15:18.758 --> 02:15:29.323]  Uh... John, I'm sure historians will look back and say, gosh, you could have done it better this way or that way.
[02:15:30.024 --> 02:15:43.091]  Uh... You know, I just, uh... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in the midst of this press conference, all the pressure of trying to come up with an answer, but...
[02:15:43.943 --> 02:15:44.463]  Hadn't yet.
[02:15:45.224 --> 02:15:48.866]  I, uh... Okay.
[02:15:50.387 --> 02:15:53.548]  And it goes on and on, so... Now that came across good, Paul.
[02:15:53.588 --> 02:15:58.191]  And then we had the last big press conference the year before where he says, this is scripted.
[02:15:59.811 --> 02:16:01.512]  So, um, well, I tell you.
[02:16:02.573 --> 02:16:05.134]  You know, he isn't as arrogant as he was a few months ago.
[02:16:05.695 --> 02:16:08.116]  You think maybe they told him, carry the boy and he's throwing fits?
[02:16:09.338 --> 02:16:10.339]  I believe that's the case.
[02:16:10.779 --> 02:16:24.550]  And we've also got word that people that you would associate with being supporters of Bush, both within the administration and former members of the previous Bush administration, are in fact now behind the scenes supporting Kerry.
[02:16:24.930 --> 02:16:27.612]  So I mean, it could be the case that they're hanging him out to dry.
[02:16:27.672 --> 02:16:28.893]  I mean, he's visibly aged.
[02:16:28.973 --> 02:16:32.015]  He's had all these strange bike and pretzel accidents.
[02:16:32.616 --> 02:16:36.879]  So it could be the case that Bush is basically on the way out and that he knows it.
[02:16:38.897 --> 02:16:40.959]  Remember, his name is Skull and Bones, temporary.
[02:16:41.259 --> 02:16:44.001]  That's right, and uh... carries his long devil.
[02:16:44.021 --> 02:16:47.124]  I tell you, this stuff's so rich.
[02:16:47.865 --> 02:16:49.986]  Chris in Texas, then Michael in Hawaii.
[02:16:50.367 --> 02:16:51.147]  Chris, go ahead.
[02:16:51.688 --> 02:16:52.368]  Hey Alex, hey Paul.
[02:16:52.969 --> 02:16:53.269]  Welcome.
[02:16:53.449 --> 02:17:07.081]  Hey, uh... the Oklahoma City Bombing Investigation Committee, uh... I was looking at their site last night and uh... it seemed like the whole focus of the investigation now is to
[02:17:08.182 --> 02:17:17.788]  Well, that's what I said, I don't know how long you've been listening, but two years ago I said, more than two years ago, I said they're going to try to
[02:17:30.228 --> 02:17:33.350]  Why do they have Iraqis involved that have worked for the CIA during the 80s?
[02:17:33.730 --> 02:17:34.731]  Why do they protect them?
[02:17:34.791 --> 02:17:42.496]  It's later to link Iraqis up with conservatives and try to claim that there's this whole intelligence network of white guys that work for the Arabs.
[02:17:42.837 --> 02:17:47.700]  That's a way to stick FEMA on the general public, and unfortunately a lot of the researchers have latched onto that.
[02:17:48.661 --> 02:17:57.367]  Yeah, I sent an email through the site, and I got a response back from Charles E.
[02:17:58.945 --> 02:18:13.071]  He's basically saying that, uh, well, they just, you know, they're focusing in on this because, you know, that's what they can prove and they don't want... Well, I mean, I think it is good to focus in on it, but the media won't tell you who those Iraqis work for.
[02:18:13.351 --> 02:18:13.852]  We know.
[02:18:14.312 --> 02:18:16.333]  They were the Republican Guard trained here during the 80s.
[02:18:16.353 --> 02:18:27.718]  Yeah, and another thing, too, I brought up the points about the, uh, you know, the bombs being pulled out from the inside of the building, the, uh, the bombs... And minute surveillance cameras.
[02:18:28.174 --> 02:18:39.882]  Yeah, the bomb squad expert on the satellite feed saying that it was a highly sophisticated bomb that was inside the building that they were defusing.
[02:18:39.922 --> 02:18:41.603]  That's all in Road to Tyranny, yes.
[02:18:41.623 --> 02:18:50.889]  Yeah, and then Mr. Key says here, you know, the bombs could never be verified.
[02:18:50.909 --> 02:18:54.371]  We couldn't even find any TV or radio newscasts or reports that referenced them.
[02:18:55.513 --> 02:18:56.235]  You're kidding!
[02:18:56.675 --> 02:18:58.980]  Yeah, that's what he says here.
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:00.643]  I mean, that's his exact words there.
[02:19:01.244 --> 02:19:01.745]  All right, Paul.
[02:19:01.865 --> 02:19:03.288]  Okay, Paul, any comments on what he just said?
[02:19:06.072 --> 02:19:11.777]  Well yeah, same case in 9-11 with the Arabs, same case with Reagan with Hinkley.
[02:19:12.137 --> 02:19:16.501]  With the Iraqis, they're patsies to be seen on the scene to be later linked with the crime.
[02:19:16.541 --> 02:19:23.766]  And we've had the articles up in the past, the LA Times, Washington Post, where these Iraqis were brought into the country by Bush Sr.
[02:19:23.786 --> 02:19:24.527]  in the first place.
[02:19:24.547 --> 02:19:30.472]  So they're the patsies to be seen on the scene when the real involvement, proven by the bombs in both Oklahoma City and World Trade Center,
[02:19:30.752 --> 02:19:36.220]  Man, from Hinckley, to Saddam, to Bin Laden, to Noriega, to Oklahoma City.
[02:19:36.280 --> 02:19:39.424]  I mean, in every case, it's that former CIA director.
[02:19:39.444 --> 02:19:41.347]  That's Scoll and Bones' member.
[02:19:41.387 --> 02:19:43.270]  It's just always him looking back at us.
[02:19:45.564 --> 02:19:48.826]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:19:48.906 --> 02:19:53.089]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:19:53.329 --> 02:19:56.131]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:19:56.311 --> 02:19:58.713]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:19:58.913 --> 02:20:07.558]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:20:07.738 --> 02:20:09.099]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:20:09.279 --> 02:20:13.422]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:20:13.762 --> 02:20:14.283]  We're good to go!
[02:20:32.722 --> 02:20:35.488]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:20:45.540 --> 02:20:46.541]  Stop the pill popping!
[02:20:46.721 --> 02:20:50.543]  No more trying to remember to take all those vitamins daily that don't entirely absorb.
[02:20:50.663 --> 02:20:51.883]  Stop dishing out cash.
[02:20:51.964 --> 02:20:58.027]  To get all the vitamins and nutrients your body needs, you'll have to pay hundreds of dollars per month and still be missing out on the essential.
[02:20:58.187 --> 02:21:05.351]  What if I told you I'm about to save you all the time and money for the product that provides all the nutritional groups that support every function of the human anatomy?
[02:21:05.531 --> 02:21:07.052]  It's called ProVitamin Complete.
[02:21:07.152 --> 02:21:08.373]  The name speaks for itself.

[02:21:14.756 --> 02:21:19.579]  That's 178 fantastic ingredients in a liquid form that is 98% absorbed.

[02:21:45.802 --> 02:21:48.024]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[02:21:48.444 --> 02:21:52.808]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[02:21:53.088 --> 02:21:58.893]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[02:21:59.133 --> 02:22:03.177]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[02:22:03.477 --> 02:22:09.122]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[02:22:09.222 --> 02:22:11.844]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[02:22:13.926 --> 02:22:17.829]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[02:22:17.869 --> 02:22:20.250]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[02:22:20.591 --> 02:22:22.892]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[02:22:23.272 --> 02:22:26.895]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[02:22:27.375 --> 02:22:33.579]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[02:22:34.039 --> 02:22:35.000]  You'll be glad you did.
[02:22:35.020 --> 02:22:35.680]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:35.700 --> 02:22:35.881]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:44.594 --> 02:22:47.835]  Ever walk into someone's house and you can tell instantly they own pets?
[02:22:48.175 --> 02:22:52.836]  They've made the mistake of using a pet odor and stain product that only covers the problem temporarily.
[02:22:53.036 --> 02:22:54.557]  We don't have that problem in our home.
[02:22:54.757 --> 02:22:57.177]  We've discovered it's just better to use PAWS.
[02:22:57.397 --> 02:23:04.159]  Pet Accident Wash-Up Solution, or PAWS, is the quickest and safest pet stain and odor eliminator known to man, or man's best friend.
[02:23:04.419 --> 02:23:07.640]  PAWS is safe on any material, even directly on your pet's bedding.

[02:23:10.641 --> 02:23:13.324]  It's guaranteed to lift stains that have been set in for years.
[02:23:13.525 --> 02:23:15.727]  Proving again, it's just better to use Paws.
[02:23:16.087 --> 02:23:19.391]  It's only a matter of time until Fido or Fluffy has an accident.
[02:23:19.631 --> 02:23:20.813]  Be prepared with Paws.
[02:23:21.133 --> 02:23:25.098]  Use Paws anywhere stains and odors are a problem, like the laundry or the bathroom.
[02:23:25.298 --> 02:23:28.782]  Try Paws once and you'll quickly discover it's just better to use Paws.
[02:23:29.062 --> 02:23:33.825]  Call 1-877-289-PAWS or visit GetPAWS.com.
[02:23:34.025 --> 02:23:37.968]  That's www.getpaws.com.
[02:23:38.168 --> 02:23:40.869]  PAWS comes with a 110% money back guarantee.
[02:23:41.110 --> 02:23:42.931]  You've nothing to lose but stains and odors.
[02:23:45.712 --> 02:23:47.874]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:23:48.454 --> 02:23:51.276]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:53.789 --> 02:24:02.251]  All right, we're going to take calls from Michael, John, Tim, James, and that's it, because I need to get into the Total Information Awareness Network, which we told you never went anywhere.
[02:24:02.271 --> 02:24:10.994]  This police state, Coca-Cola commercial, just a bunch of other news about the so-called War on Terror, you name it.
[02:24:11.514 --> 02:24:13.515]  But right now, let's go to Michael in Hawaii.
[02:24:13.555 --> 02:24:14.615]  Thanks for holding, Michael.
[02:24:14.795 --> 02:24:15.415]  You're on the air.
[02:24:15.775 --> 02:24:18.176]  Thank you, Alex, and good morning to the dynamic duo.
[02:24:19.657 --> 02:24:20.778]  Got a quick question for you.
[02:24:20.938 --> 02:24:21.378]  Two of them.
[02:24:21.918 --> 02:24:29.682]  One, I'm going to be going to Dallas in July for my dad's 70th birthday, and one of the presents I want to get him is a set of your tapes.
[02:24:29.782 --> 02:24:36.405]  One of the tapes I'm going to get is the 9-11 Road to Tyranny, and what other three tapes should I get to go with that one?
[02:24:37.886 --> 02:24:43.148]  Well, I would get Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State 3, Total Enslavement,
[02:24:44.171 --> 02:24:47.633]  And, uh, dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:24:47.673 --> 02:24:49.214]  I mean, all ten of my videos are good.
[02:24:49.234 --> 02:24:50.915]  I don't know which three or four you should get.
[02:24:50.935 --> 02:24:54.177]  I mean, I know definitely Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror.
[02:24:54.457 --> 02:24:57.799]  Paul, if you were to get four of my videos, which four would you get?
[02:24:57.819 --> 02:25:13.068]  Uh, Road to Tyranny, I would get Bohemian Grove, maybe Police State 2000, Police State 2, where it shows the provocateur, anarchist in Seattle, and that's a good way to point out problem, reaction, solution.
[02:25:13.761 --> 02:25:14.422]  I think so.
[02:25:28.209 --> 02:25:34.195]  I was talking with a colonel friend of mine who last week had talked with some of his friends in Washington.
[02:25:34.215 --> 02:25:41.041]  You all know that they've got that big naval exercise with the United States Navy out in the Atlantic right now.
[02:25:41.421 --> 02:25:51.350]  He said that Washington is very worried because supposedly there's an admiral in charge of one of those carrier task forces that is so fed up with what's going on.
[02:25:51.937 --> 02:25:53.939]  So you're there in Hawaii and a serving colonel told you this?
[02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:54.680]  Okay, retired.
[02:26:10.979 --> 02:26:12.000]  Well, I know this.
[02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:14.181]  We're getting a lot of rumblings of this.
[02:26:15.361 --> 02:26:18.863]  In fact, I was meaning to cover that in the next segment after we finish with calls.
[02:26:19.363 --> 02:26:21.104]  A lot of talk of terror attacks.
[02:26:21.224 --> 02:26:22.565]  A lot of weird behavior.
[02:26:22.945 --> 02:26:24.466]  Martial law in Georgia.
[02:26:25.687 --> 02:26:27.848]  It's a lot of scary movement going on.
[02:26:27.888 --> 02:26:28.468]  Paul Watson?
[02:26:29.489 --> 02:26:29.749]  Yeah.
[02:26:29.989 --> 02:26:32.850]  I mean, these naval deployments are going on at the moment.
[02:26:33.110 --> 02:26:36.052]  There's also a story out of AFP which said that
[02:26:36.567 --> 02:26:44.614]  There was another naval deployment going to the shores of Africa to threaten Africa over its oil production.
[02:26:44.994 --> 02:26:48.077]  So all over the place you see these naval deployments.
[02:26:48.097 --> 02:26:56.484]  And then we've got Interfax, major Russian news agency, saying the Russians may be working with the US in some attack on someone.
[02:26:56.524 --> 02:26:58.125]  I mean, I've got that article here.
[02:26:59.335 --> 02:27:05.978]  Yeah, I mean, there's also Chinese exhibitions going out and all sorts of rumblings happening all over the world.
[02:27:06.238 --> 02:27:15.303]  And of course, Russia's last military exercise a few months ago was simulated around the pretext of an attack, a direct attack on the United States.
[02:27:16.023 --> 02:27:18.484]  So, um, different shenanigans going on there.
[02:27:18.704 --> 02:27:26.248]  And I don't normally talk like this, and I don't know if anything's going to happen, but there... Well, there's smoke, there's fire, and there's a lot of weird stuff going on.
[02:27:28.536 --> 02:27:30.297]  Okay, so I hope that answers your question, Michael.
[02:27:30.337 --> 02:27:31.938]  We'll talk more about it in the next segment.
[02:27:32.359 --> 02:27:33.339]  Thanks.
[02:27:33.419 --> 02:27:34.260]  John in Florida.
[02:27:34.300 --> 02:27:35.060]  John, go ahead.
[02:27:35.561 --> 02:27:36.501]  Hey, good afternoon, everybody.
[02:27:36.541 --> 02:27:36.902]  How are you?
[02:27:37.102 --> 02:27:37.362]  Good.
[02:27:37.742 --> 02:27:41.004]  Good hearing from you every day, and I enjoy all your shows, Alex, and hello, Paul.
[02:27:41.184 --> 02:27:42.225]  Thank you for all your hard work.
[02:27:43.346 --> 02:27:48.970]  Is it true that Nancy Davis, her father was the founder of the CFR?
[02:27:48.990 --> 02:27:57.175]  I'm just calling on curiosity here, because they've been putting her name out there in the last 24 hours, and I heard a long time ago that Nancy Davis
[02:27:57.719 --> 02:28:00.500]  I had heard that, but I can't confirm it.
[02:28:00.780 --> 02:28:04.401]  I was reading part of Jim Miles' book, Rule by Secrecy, today and I think it mentioned that.
[02:28:04.421 --> 02:28:08.001]  I can't be certain, but I think it mentioned that.
[02:28:20.019 --> 02:28:25.681]  Bush is tiding closely with the CFR, who was, you know, related to Hinkley, and then they got control over the Reagans.
[02:28:25.741 --> 02:28:28.102]  So, I think it is true.
[02:28:29.722 --> 02:28:32.543]  I've also got this article out of Maine with Bush Sr.
[02:28:32.683 --> 02:28:35.824]  Saturday going, oh, Reagan helped bring in the new world order.
[02:28:38.285 --> 02:28:39.345]  I'll hang up and listen in.
[02:28:39.385 --> 02:28:41.166]  That's kind of what I wanted to run it by you.
[02:28:41.546 --> 02:28:42.306]  Okay, thank you.
[02:28:42.346 --> 02:28:42.986]  Very interesting.
[02:28:43.546 --> 02:28:45.147]  Let's talk to Tim in Ohio.
[02:28:45.207 --> 02:28:45.987]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:28:46.427 --> 02:28:47.107]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:28:47.467 --> 02:28:47.788]  Welcome.
[02:28:48.048 --> 02:28:48.448]  Hello, Paul.
[02:28:49.088 --> 02:28:49.288]  Hello.
[02:28:49.693 --> 02:28:49.993]  Hi Paul.
[02:28:50.013 --> 02:28:51.574]  I don't know if you're still there or not.
[02:28:52.955 --> 02:29:03.323]  I think I brought this up in an earlier broadcast on your show where we talked about... Junior almost looks like he's under the MKUltra program.
[02:29:05.444 --> 02:29:06.245]  He is weird.
[02:29:06.285 --> 02:29:08.466]  Sometimes he's stumbling, fumbling, can't even talk.
[02:29:08.526 --> 02:29:09.647]  Other times he's focused.
[02:29:10.433 --> 02:29:12.374]  He's always getting bruises on his body.
[02:29:13.655 --> 02:29:14.016]  Stay there.
[02:29:14.036 --> 02:29:15.236]  We'll talk more about it when we get back.
[02:29:15.256 --> 02:29:16.918]  We'll talk to Tim and finish up with James.
[02:29:17.458 --> 02:29:21.881]  Then I'm going to get into these terror alerts and impending terror attacks the government's saying.
[02:29:22.121 --> 02:29:23.322]  It's going to happen.
[02:29:23.602 --> 02:29:25.103]  Going to be ultra-massive.
[02:29:26.144 --> 02:29:30.327]  One of the unauthorized Bush biographers, Tarpley, has written a big article on this.
[02:29:30.767 --> 02:29:31.468]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:31.488 --> 02:29:31.908]  Stay with us.
[02:29:35.851 --> 02:29:36.771]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.252 --> 02:29:38.753]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:39.765 --> 02:29:42.526]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:46.088 --> 02:29:49.169]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[02:29:49.369 --> 02:29:52.430]  Don't underestimate the urgency of the need to become self-sufficient.
[02:29:52.570 --> 02:29:58.653]  In our kit, we're sending you 25 pounds of organic red winter wheat and that's nearly a year of high-potency wheatgrass juice.
[02:29:58.873 --> 02:30:04.075]  The book, Wheatgrass Nature's Finest Medicine and our beautiful stainless steel wheatgrass juicer.
[02:30:04.275 --> 02:30:16.350]  But most importantly, we are professional wheatgrass growers and I am going to be your contact to walk you through the process of successfully growing your continuing self-supply of full-scale nutrition from pennies worth of grain.
[02:30:16.470 --> 02:30:17.311]  So call 1-877-MY-WHEAT
[02:30:19.694 --> 02:30:22.155]  Or, go to AustinWheatGrass.com.
[02:30:22.395 --> 02:30:28.278]  Growing your own wheatgrass is not as easy as some would have you think, and we've learned this the hard way through five years of growing experience.
[02:30:28.438 --> 02:30:30.419]  And we're going to pass on to you our knowledge.
[02:30:30.559 --> 02:30:31.960]  Don't settle for anything less.
[02:30:32.180 --> 02:30:33.700]  Call me and get the real details.
[02:30:33.720 --> 02:30:34.041]  1-877-MY-WHEAT.
[02:30:34.101 --> 02:30:34.461]  That's 1-877-699-4328.
[02:30:34.521 --> 02:30:38.983]  And as always, we thank you for your support of our labors and of this network.
[02:30:45.040 --> 02:30:47.001]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[02:30:47.081 --> 02:30:57.809]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:30:58.169 --> 02:31:02.712]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:31:02.772 --> 02:31:14.120]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:31:14.700 --> 02:31:21.545]  The water then flows through the PF2 element, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:31:21.945 --> 02:31:24.066]  Your purified water is now ready!
[02:31:24.567 --> 02:31:29.530]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[02:31:29.830 --> 02:31:36.140]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:31:36.220 --> 02:31:40.407]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:31:40.647 --> 02:31:41.388]  That's toll free.
[02:31:41.408 --> 02:31:41.448]  888-803-4438.
[02:31:45.623 --> 02:31:49.984]  Most of us have had a cafe we frequented because the service was so wonderful or the food was so great.
[02:31:50.144 --> 02:31:57.186]  The Silver Bear Cafe understands this philosophy and has incorporated these ideals into a website that offers food for thought to nourish the mind.
[02:31:57.486 --> 02:32:04.368]  Membership in the bear consists of a large and growing group of patriots who, like you, realize there are things in this great country that need changing right away.
[02:32:04.708 --> 02:32:12.215]  The Silver Bear Cafe provides you with an income opportunity that will provide you and your family with an ongoing revenue stream in return for simply spreading the message.
[02:32:12.595 --> 02:32:18.521]  So many of you have been trying to get the message out individually, but collectively our voices are strong and cannot be silenced.
[02:32:18.961 --> 02:32:21.644]  Membership in the bear will teach you the secrets of financial freedom.
[02:32:21.804 --> 02:32:24.106]  How the runaway government is crushing the American dream.
[02:32:24.426 --> 02:32:28.329]  Why wars are played out across the globe, the fractional reserve system, etc.
[02:32:28.529 --> 02:32:31.191]  Where we're headed and what you can do to prepare yourself.
[02:32:31.531 --> 02:32:32.612]  Knowledge is power.
[02:32:32.852 --> 02:32:37.775]  Feed your mind and feed your financial independence with a visit to silverbearcafe.com.
[02:32:37.915 --> 02:32:39.977]  That's silverbearcafe.com.
[02:32:40.117 --> 02:32:43.299]  Do it today and preserve this country's greatness for generations to come.
[02:33:01.206 --> 02:33:06.710]  Trying, my friends, to get you to look at the big picture, to get outside the box, to shift your paradigm.
[02:33:07.951 --> 02:33:10.432]  The left, the right in this country are totally controlled.
[02:33:10.512 --> 02:33:12.013]  It's all Hollywood theater.
[02:33:12.654 --> 02:33:15.095]  Literally, it's time to see the big picture.
[02:33:16.056 --> 02:33:19.138]  Okay, a big news blitz of information coming up here in just a few minutes.
[02:33:19.178 --> 02:33:21.379]  Let's finish up with these calls.
[02:33:22.620 --> 02:33:26.563]  Tim in Ohio, continuing with the comments that you were just making.
[02:33:26.943 --> 02:33:28.404]  Yes, thank you for holding me over.
[02:33:29.186 --> 02:33:42.853]  In the research I've done on the various MKUltra projects that they've encountered in the 60s and 70s, one of the physical clues that it was talking about was someone with a smaller or a droopy left eye.
[02:33:43.774 --> 02:33:55.400]  And I look at all these people on the news, from Rather to O'Reilly to Brokaw, to everybody, you know, you just keep looking, all the listeners, look, watch the people that have, and count how many droopy or tiny left eyes
[02:33:55.919 --> 02:33:58.560]  Smaller than the right eye that you see in a day on TV.
[02:33:58.840 --> 02:33:59.500]  It'll shock you.
[02:34:00.641 --> 02:34:03.202]  Well, a lot of that just comes from stress and being tired.
[02:34:03.262 --> 02:34:18.928]  I mean, you know, why go off MKUltra like that when the History Channel has hour-long specials about him kidnapping over a thousand people, the founder of the American Psychological Association, and with masses of hallucinogens and audio recordings over years,
[02:34:19.748 --> 02:34:21.509]  Turning them into mind control slaves.
[02:34:21.749 --> 02:34:26.751]  And there's all this admitted stuff, Senate hearings, all of it, but that never gets focused on.
[02:34:26.791 --> 02:34:37.497]  It's like, ooh, it's speech patterns, or how somebody's eye looks, and stuff like... I'm not trying to criticize you, sir, but... And there's other forms of mind control.
[02:34:37.537 --> 02:34:40.738]  There's socially, how the elite raises their children.
[02:34:41.799 --> 02:34:42.959]  What they drum into them.
[02:34:43.159 --> 02:34:44.520]  The social conditioning.
[02:34:44.980 --> 02:34:46.121]  But, Doug, thanks for the call.
[02:34:46.181 --> 02:34:47.361]  Paul Watson, any comments?
[02:34:48.042 --> 02:34:48.722]  Well, sometimes...
[02:34:49.278 --> 02:34:53.481]  You know, physical condition is a sign of what's going on in somebody's mind.
[02:34:53.521 --> 02:34:56.023]  I mean, that's where the phrase bitter and twisted comes from.
[02:34:56.443 --> 02:35:01.567]  But we had the White House source reports, which were later, you know, taken by Capitol Hill Blue.
[02:35:01.607 --> 02:35:04.709]  So it was proven as factual that Bush had this
[02:35:05.249 --> 02:35:10.918]  Seizure or mini-stroke and since that he's been having to take oral medication twice a day.
[02:35:11.619 --> 02:35:20.412]  He's had difficulty following unscripted press conferences which would explain what we played in, you know, a couple of segments ago where he stumbles over his words.
[02:35:20.891 --> 02:35:21.892]  Well, it happened to Bush Sr.
[02:35:21.932 --> 02:35:22.032]  too.
[02:35:48.743 --> 02:35:51.265]  But a lot of it's just the ultra-high-stress job.
[02:35:51.965 --> 02:36:04.113]  But then again, you know, Bush goes running twice a day for two hours and he basically barely does anything apart from, you know, enter these cabinet meetings where, as we talked about before, he just sits and takes orders.
[02:36:04.173 --> 02:36:08.956]  So whether that would be, you know, stressful to that extent is a question.
[02:36:08.976 --> 02:36:11.738]  Well, see, the point is they don't have to mind-control the presidents.
[02:36:11.778 --> 02:36:12.738]  They're New World Order.
[02:36:12.778 --> 02:36:13.699]  That's why they're there.
[02:36:14.528 --> 02:36:15.148]  Well, exactly.
[02:36:15.569 --> 02:36:17.109]  He just reads off the teleprompter.
[02:36:17.310 --> 02:36:20.531]  Yeah, mind control is for assassinations to then take the blame.
[02:36:21.412 --> 02:36:25.434]  That's what the MKUltra program that we know of was for.
[02:36:26.535 --> 02:36:27.575]  But, um, I don't know.
[02:36:28.536 --> 02:36:29.256]  One last call.
[02:36:29.356 --> 02:36:30.077]  Jim in Texas.
[02:36:30.117 --> 02:36:30.757]  Go ahead, Jim.
[02:36:30.777 --> 02:36:32.478]  Me?
[02:36:34.119 --> 02:36:35.520]  Yeah, that's you.
[02:36:35.880 --> 02:36:38.001]  Okay, sorry about that, Jim and James.
[02:36:38.501 --> 02:36:41.663]  I have three things I'd like to discuss and I'll try to make it quick.
[02:36:42.498 --> 02:36:42.778]  I don't know.
[02:37:03.081 --> 02:37:03.902]  Oh, ATB!
[02:37:04.322 --> 02:37:08.725]  Okay, I didn't say that because I'm trying to keep from getting in trouble, but anyway... Well, why would you get in trouble?
[02:37:08.926 --> 02:37:12.688]  They got signs hanging up that say you're going to have to thumb scan.
[02:37:13.469 --> 02:37:25.078]  Well, what I'm about to say is because of you and being awake from what you've discussed for the past six years or more, I was awake to it several months ago and I refused to do it.
[02:37:25.118 --> 02:37:32.604]  I told my store supervisor that I didn't want to do it and I was going to go to another store to avoid it and he didn't want to lose me, so...
[02:37:33.939 --> 02:37:49.482]  By me standing up, I just want people out there, if there's anybody out there that is going to be faced with this, if you stand up for yourself, they will bow down because he wanted me to stay and he's going to work a situation out where I can manually key in my number on the keyboard instead of thumb scan.
[02:37:49.502 --> 02:37:57.484]  So I just want people to know that you can, if you're strong and you're awake, you can do it.
[02:37:59.010 --> 02:38:01.731]  You first have to be awake.
[02:38:01.872 --> 02:38:03.692]  Let me commend you, James.
[02:38:03.892 --> 02:38:04.493]  I mean, look.
[02:38:05.393 --> 02:38:09.595]  They've actually put thumb scanners in to get your food down at Houston and College Station.
[02:38:09.655 --> 02:38:15.357]  Now they're making employees at most of the stores, I guess it's coming to your store now, thumb scan to do this.
[02:38:15.457 --> 02:38:18.839]  And it's all hooked into the driver's license system.
[02:38:18.879 --> 02:38:20.120]  It's all the track and trace.
[02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:21.740]  And you're right.
[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:24.421]  More people should stand up and say no that work there.
[02:38:24.622 --> 02:38:25.462]  And when they put it in,
[02:38:26.684 --> 02:38:29.805]  At the self-checkout lane, which has already started in two cities in Texas.
[02:38:30.505 --> 02:38:32.666]  And it's other retailers that are doing this now.
[02:38:32.746 --> 02:38:34.166]  We've got to say no.
[02:38:34.606 --> 02:38:35.727]  We've got the power.
[02:38:36.207 --> 02:38:39.528]  If even 10% of us say no, they'll be forced to stop it.
[02:38:39.648 --> 02:38:48.830]  But the question is, can we even get 10% of these yuppies to... Because people just accept the system, you know, like they're in a rat maze or something.
[02:38:48.870 --> 02:38:50.351]  Like they don't have any power over it.
[02:38:50.671 --> 02:38:55.412]  The sad thing is, a few months ago, when I was awake, they were coming up really quickly.
[02:38:56.084 --> 02:39:04.448]  I was telling co-workers about it and how I wasn't going to do it, and the majority of them, a few of them acknowledged it and they didn't like it, but overall nobody wanted to react to it.
[02:39:04.468 --> 02:39:08.810]  They're just going to go along with it just because, you know, it's like, well what else do you do?
[02:39:08.830 --> 02:39:09.890]  That's the sad part about it.
[02:39:10.370 --> 02:39:14.632]  Well now that you've done this, you need to get others to do it.
[02:39:15.172 --> 02:39:16.393]  That's the problem that I'm in.
[02:39:16.893 --> 02:39:18.154]  Okay, you know what?
[02:39:18.194 --> 02:39:20.535]  If they fire you, you're going to have a major lawsuit.
[02:39:20.935 --> 02:39:25.257]  He asked me not to tell anybody else that he was doing this for me because he didn't want a rebellion.
[02:39:26.767 --> 02:39:31.749]  I'm going to let you have an extra piece of bread in the can, but don't tell anybody else.
[02:39:32.109 --> 02:39:32.569]  Right.
[02:39:32.609 --> 02:39:34.290]  I do have a couple other questions.
[02:39:34.310 --> 02:39:37.071]  Go ahead and ask them real quick, because I'm almost out of time.
[02:39:37.351 --> 02:39:37.791]  I know you are.
[02:39:37.811 --> 02:39:38.251]  I'm sorry.
[02:39:38.831 --> 02:39:53.836]  I hate going into speculation, but I'm wondering, have you heard anything that might lead towards the idea that the attempted fascination on Reagan might have been staged to look like a fascination attempt, but actually was intended to fail just to scare him into submission?
[02:39:54.540 --> 02:39:56.742]  Because, I mean, if they wanted to assassinate him, they could have.
[02:39:57.283 --> 02:40:10.535]  And then I'm wondering if there's any, if you've heard anything or any possibility that maybe there might have been some kind of external chemical influence on Reagan after he left the presidency, working to get Alzheimer's.
[02:40:10.915 --> 02:40:11.055]  Oh, yes.
[02:40:11.155 --> 02:40:11.556]  Clearly.
[02:40:11.596 --> 02:40:13.498]  Yeah, thanks for the call.
[02:40:13.558 --> 02:40:14.158]  Good questions.
[02:40:14.218 --> 02:40:14.979]  Paul, comments?
[02:40:16.040 --> 02:40:18.142]  Well, the question is, you know, whether it was
[02:40:18.852 --> 02:40:22.675]  Intended to just be a warning, whereas, you know, they wouldn't actually kill him.
[02:40:23.215 --> 02:40:40.546]  That would be consistent with the fact that, you know, what I was talking about earlier, the NBC reporter said that the secret service agent on the roof had a clear direct line of sight shot, so he presumably could have easily shot Kennedy in the back of the head, but he hit him, you know, in the shoulder.
[02:40:40.646 --> 02:40:41.346]  You mean Reagan?
[02:40:42.007 --> 02:40:42.647]  Reagan, sorry.
[02:40:43.668 --> 02:40:46.990]  So that would tally with the possibility that it was just a warning.
[02:40:49.096 --> 02:40:57.018]  Regardless, they were enemies, he spoke out against Bush, said he was a globalist, and now Bush, that Reagan's dead, is going, oh, he was for the New World Order!
[02:41:00.738 --> 02:41:02.979]  Again, folks, this is in the major main newspaper.
[02:41:03.539 --> 02:41:07.800]  If you want to go read it, it's in the Press Herald on our websites right now.
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:12.681]  I'll tell you what, Paul, before we get into all this final news, the upcoming terror attacks and the rest of it,
[02:41:13.795 --> 02:41:22.579]  This Coca-Cola ad that's on PrisonPlanet.TV, for years I've been saying they're going to sell GPS, they're going to sell implantable chips, as it's fun, it's cool.
[02:41:23.159 --> 02:41:26.340]  In this ad, it's two people working at a fast food restaurant.
[02:41:26.741 --> 02:41:30.482]  They go behind closed doors, the boy and girl, the two teenagers.
[02:41:30.522 --> 02:41:31.783]  They start kissing each other.
[02:41:31.803 --> 02:41:32.823]  Ooh, it's so much fun.
[02:41:33.283 --> 02:41:36.705]  They open Cokes that are GPS-tracked in the black helicopters.
[02:41:37.145 --> 02:41:37.865]  It's the movement to make
[02:42:07.583 --> 02:42:10.085]  And it's basically started with tattoos, didn't it?
[02:42:10.206 --> 02:42:20.896]  Because it's the marking of the body as a fad, and it's being driven through such things as RFID tags on footballers to track them on the field in different quadrants of the field.
[02:42:21.576 --> 02:42:25.440]  And that's what the agenda is, but also interestingly enough,
[02:42:25.888 --> 02:42:40.638]  The history of Coca-Cola and advertising has links to the Nazis, where in the 40s Coca-Cola GmbH in Germany advertised in the Nazi press, you know, therefore financially supporting it.
[02:42:40.698 --> 02:42:44.461]  Their bottling plants were in occupied territories.
[02:42:45.181 --> 02:43:01.576]  And then in 1941 when the Coca-Cola supply was cut off and they could no longer get the syrup from America to make the drink, they just went ahead and invented a new drink which was specifically for the Nazi drinks market and we know that today as Fanta.
[02:43:02.437 --> 02:43:06.921]  So Coca-Cola has Nazi links with regards to their advertising.
[02:43:06.961 --> 02:43:09.303]  And why couldn't they just make the syrup in Germany?
[02:43:09.323 --> 02:43:11.165]  Because Coca-Cola plants don't grow in Germany.
[02:43:12.935 --> 02:43:19.737]  Yeah, so it was a willful collaboration with the Nazi regime, just as, you know, Ford and many of these other companies were doing at the time.
[02:43:19.797 --> 02:43:33.620]  And Bush, and IBM, and... Now, again, you'll hear the helicopter, and then it cuts back to them kissing in the store room, and then the black helicopter delivers them the beautiful new vehicle, because their GPS track is so much fun, go ahead and hit that.
[02:43:48.695 --> 02:43:49.835]  The search is on.
[02:43:50.096 --> 02:43:55.818]  Find a Coke can with a GPS locator, activate it, and we'll find you and drop off an all-new 2005 Chevy Equinox.
[02:43:55.858 --> 02:43:56.838]  Do you feel that?
[02:43:57.498 --> 02:43:58.239]  Wherever you are.
[02:44:00.039 --> 02:44:01.560]  Coca-Cola Unexpected Summer.
[02:44:02.080 --> 02:44:03.661]  You can win, but you can't hide.
[02:44:04.061 --> 02:44:04.601]  Call me!
[02:44:06.542 --> 02:44:09.223]  So he gets the girl, and then now he's got the car.
[02:44:09.363 --> 02:44:10.403]  Oh, call me, baby!
[02:44:10.423 --> 02:44:13.304]  Your GPS, you can win, but you can't hide, Paul.
[02:44:16.934 --> 02:44:25.899]  Yeah, and then by extension, I suppose it's now cool to add the GPS system in your car, because you'll never get lost and, you know, have that linked in with OnStar and all that kind of thing.
[02:44:26.640 --> 02:44:29.861]  So, I mean... Hey, I'll tell you what, can we find that Neocon star?
[02:44:30.182 --> 02:44:32.103]  It's on CD too, Stephanie.
[02:44:32.923 --> 02:44:36.365]  My entire computer file got wiped up there with all our great clips.
[02:44:36.985 --> 02:44:38.406]  Can you find that Neocon star?
[02:44:39.367 --> 02:44:39.747]  Stephanie?
[02:44:41.128 --> 02:44:42.709]  If you can't find it, George can find it.
[02:44:42.769 --> 02:44:43.529]  It's in his computer.
[02:44:43.849 --> 02:44:45.030]  Just have him transfer it over.
[02:44:47.085 --> 02:44:49.386]  I haven't played that in a couple of months, a neocon star.
[02:44:50.247 --> 02:44:55.111]  But, Paul, let's go over this other news here.
[02:44:55.611 --> 02:45:06.679]  Russian military to join Bush wars, and it says military exercise, largest Russian military exercise in 15 years going on with our military.
[02:45:07.019 --> 02:45:08.040]  What do you make of that, Paul?
[02:45:09.358 --> 02:45:15.607]  Well, it's interesting because some Russian sources in their government have denied it, so maybe they're trying to keep it a secret.
[02:45:16.148 --> 02:45:20.194]  But there are numerous exercises of this type going on around the world.
[02:45:20.354 --> 02:45:20.975]  In fact, today,
[02:45:21.525 --> 02:45:25.867]  Japan announced that they'll be conducting one of these military exercises with the US.
[02:45:26.347 --> 02:45:28.368]  So, are they building up for something?
[02:45:28.968 --> 02:45:45.954]  I don't know, but certainly with the reports coming out of Taiwan and China, where China are also conducting record-level exercises of their own and building up militarily against Taiwan, whereas Taiwan are also doing the same, you know, that could be something afoot.
[02:45:46.154 --> 02:45:48.455]  So, I mean, they've deployed around the world.
[02:45:48.935 --> 02:45:50.216]  We had a report which said that
[02:45:50.996 --> 02:45:55.941]  They were deploying a naval fleet to threaten Africa with regard to its oil supply.
[02:45:56.262 --> 02:45:57.803]  Okay, I want to shift gears.
[02:45:58.824 --> 02:46:05.612]  Total Information Awareness, alive and well in Arlington County, they never got rid of Total Information Awareness, they just changed the name.
[02:46:06.572 --> 02:46:08.433]  At the state level it's called Matrix.
[02:46:08.513 --> 02:46:11.195]  It tracks everything you do, buy, sell.
[02:46:11.855 --> 02:46:13.076]  It's with a major institution.
[02:46:13.156 --> 02:46:23.242]  Customers of Bank of America branch at 3625 Fairfax Drive in Arlington, Virginia often wonder about the Arlington police car that is always parked in front of the building next door.
[02:46:24.362 --> 02:46:30.286]  And it says they also can't help but notice the two armed guards from the private Catwell Security Agency
[02:46:31.189 --> 02:46:34.798]  Patrol the street in front of the building, and I each pass her by warily.
[02:46:34.818 --> 02:46:39.268]  What's going on across the street, one woman asked, while waiting in line to deposit her paycheck.
[02:46:39.869 --> 02:46:40.390]  Not sure?
[02:46:42.096 --> 02:46:57.070]  Well, it says, actually, if the woman knew what was happening inside the nondescript office building at 3701 Fairfax Drive, she might think it really does matter, because the building houses the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, run by convicted felon Admiral Poindexter.
[02:46:57.910 --> 02:47:02.835]  The Big Brother program, Congress thought it killed, Total Information Awareness Network.
[02:47:03.519 --> 02:47:11.509]  And when the woman comes in to cash her check next door, immediately, no matter where she was in the world, it runs through the Total Information Awareness Network, Paul.
[02:47:12.670 --> 02:47:14.612]  Yeah, so they didn't even change the name.
[02:47:14.933 --> 02:47:19.098]  The Capitol Hill Blue article says that the White House
[02:47:19.981 --> 02:47:47.487]  uh... in line with the pentagon simply blacked back blacked back to the project meaning that you know it became part of the black budget with no oversight whatsoever and how many trillions of dollars went missing from the pentagon to presumably going to the black budget so they haven't even changed the name it's just a secret black budget operation to catalog all your transactions of every nature inside this one government database and it's Arlington Virginia
[02:47:48.583 --> 02:47:52.805]  3701 Fairfax Drive, so we know the exact address of it.
[02:47:53.145 --> 02:47:54.886]  Now again, that's just one note of all this.
[02:47:54.926 --> 02:47:58.148]  They've got it in Colorado Springs, NSA at Fort Meade.
[02:47:58.528 --> 02:48:00.829]  These are all just programs of this overall system.
[02:48:01.129 --> 02:48:03.310]  This is what life will be like under it, folks.
[02:48:03.590 --> 02:48:05.931]  Here is Neocon Star by Michael Corbin.
[02:48:06.252 --> 02:48:15.496]  The following is an actual conversation between a Neocon Star operator and a subscriber in distress, who is locked in her car and doesn't have the proper authorization to get out.
[02:48:16.036 --> 02:48:18.917]  With NeoconSTAR, help is just a satellite away.
[02:48:20.778 --> 02:48:24.340]  NeoconSTAR, how can I offer you great service today?
[02:48:24.520 --> 02:48:26.781]  Please help me, I'm trapped in my car!
[02:48:26.881 --> 02:48:28.762]  My retina scanner won't work!
[02:48:28.962 --> 02:48:30.102]  Just relax, sir.
[02:48:30.222 --> 02:48:31.943]  It's not sir, it's ma'am!
[02:48:32.043 --> 02:48:33.764]  Please hurry, it's hot in here!
[02:48:33.984 --> 02:48:36.145]  According to Admiral Poindexter's database,
[02:48:38.874 --> 02:48:39.155]  Right.
[02:48:39.456 --> 02:48:43.867]  I have a live shot of you from the Neocon Star Observation Blimp in your area.
[02:48:44.007 --> 02:48:45.190]  I'm an old lady.
[02:48:45.210 --> 02:48:46.092]  Alright, sir.
[02:48:46.172 --> 02:48:48.057]  Looks like you have no outstanding warrant, sir.
[02:49:02.551 --> 02:49:03.171]  So now?
[02:49:03.471 --> 02:49:04.632]  But I can't find it.
[02:49:04.672 --> 02:49:05.732]  I'm looking everywhere.
[02:49:05.812 --> 02:49:07.913]  I can't find my national ID card.
[02:49:08.153 --> 02:49:12.594]  Sir, I'm gonna send a Homeland Security helicopter there right now to check you out.
[02:49:12.614 --> 02:49:15.395]  You have a 99.2% chance of being a terrorist.
[02:49:15.955 --> 02:49:20.757]  Would you like the in-car lethal injection right now, or would you prefer to wait for the agents?
[02:49:21.457 --> 02:49:21.977]  Okay.
[02:49:22.558 --> 02:49:24.558]  I'll take the lethal injection, please.
[02:49:24.898 --> 02:49:27.179]  Thanks for using Neocon Star.
[02:49:27.519 --> 02:49:28.319]  Have a nice day.
[02:49:29.480 --> 02:49:29.840]  Alright.
[02:49:31.429 --> 02:49:38.231]  Now, everything in that piece is already starting to happen, other than the in-car lethal injection.
[02:49:38.311 --> 02:49:42.013]  Only the communist Chinese have some mobile death trucks that do that.
[02:49:42.493 --> 02:49:45.414]  They strap you down in a suit that has automatic injectors.
[02:49:46.434 --> 02:49:49.835]  I mean, Paul, Toyota's coming out with a new car, concept car.
[02:49:49.855 --> 02:49:51.016]  We have to swipe your card.
[02:49:51.636 --> 02:49:52.836]  All this is happening, Paul.
[02:49:54.117 --> 02:49:54.677]  Well, exactly.
[02:49:55.367 --> 02:49:56.127]  They get it through.
[02:49:56.187 --> 02:50:14.094]  They've got it through in this country or they're preparing the groundwork for it by installing this network of cameras which then scan license plates which we've also had reports out of several towns in America which basically blanket the whole town with cameras to then deduct people's accounts automatically after scanning their number plates.
[02:50:14.114 --> 02:50:15.795]  And Finland's been doing it for five years.
[02:50:16.355 --> 02:50:23.096]  Yeah, so the introduction of GPS, mandatory GPS tracking, is what that's all aligned to go into.
[02:50:23.116 --> 02:50:38.099]  I mean, the adverts, you'll find them on the neocon radio talk shows, like Limbaugh and Hannity, those on-star adverts are in the middle of their shows, but it's, you know, it's, oh, my dog's trapped inside the car, please help me, he might die, it's hot.
[02:50:38.939 --> 02:50:41.740]  So it basically paints people as pathetic.
[02:50:42.280 --> 02:50:43.200]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:47.176 --> 02:50:47.476]  I think so.
[02:51:02.538 --> 02:51:03.199]  We're good to go!
[02:51:32.057 --> 02:51:35.160]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:35.320 --> 02:51:41.285]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:45.569 --> 02:51:48.432]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[02:51:49.165 --> 02:51:50.446]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:51:50.666 --> 02:51:56.409]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:51:56.669 --> 02:52:01.912]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:52:02.212 --> 02:52:06.374]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:52:06.554 --> 02:52:10.336]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:52:10.596 --> 02:52:15.199]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:52:15.299 --> 02:52:21.543]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:52:21.603 --> 02:52:23.484]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:53:05.039 --> 02:53:09.380]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:53:09.580 --> 02:53:10.541]  Try Halo Methane.
[02:53:10.661 --> 02:53:17.965]  And volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:53:18.205 --> 02:53:24.528]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul tastes like chlorine and sulfur odors.

[02:54:10.237 --> 02:54:13.839]  I want to hit a few final news stories with you Paul and I want to thank you for coming on with us but
[02:54:14.319 --> 02:54:17.660]  Tell people about PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:54:17.680 --> 02:54:23.142]  15 cents a day, weekly video reports, daily audio reports, text reports, you name it.
[02:54:23.702 --> 02:54:26.223]  Why should folks sign up at PrisonPlanet.TV?
[02:54:27.223 --> 02:54:30.564]  Well, because obviously, you know, it's great value for money.
[02:54:30.604 --> 02:54:35.846]  We've got video reports every week, every audio interview of the Alex Jones Show posted.
[02:54:36.266 --> 02:54:39.547]  Right now we've got a poll running, which is for members only.
[02:54:40.020 --> 02:54:44.764]  Where they can actually vote for which guests on the shortlist that they want to appear on the show.
[02:54:44.884 --> 02:54:47.946]  So it's giving people a chance to become involved, you know, in the show.
[02:54:48.487 --> 02:54:51.429]  And we've got, you know, we're going to put our books up there eventually.
[02:54:51.890 --> 02:54:55.673]  All kinds of different materials are going to go up over the course of the next few months.
[02:54:55.693 --> 02:54:59.476]  So it's definitely worth, you know, paying that small amount to support our bandwidth.
[02:55:00.056 --> 02:55:03.419]  Yeah, really it then goes into supporting all the websites because we can't continue.
[02:55:03.439 --> 02:55:05.701]  We still offer a lot of video and audio for free there.
[02:55:06.601 --> 02:55:12.183]  But we just cannot continue with tens of millions of individual users per month without getting somebody to support it.

[02:55:31.343 --> 02:55:33.923]  It gets into Israel carrying out terror in Israel.
[02:55:34.604 --> 02:55:38.565]  It gets into the history of government sponsored terror.
[02:55:39.365 --> 02:55:40.586]  I've made my ten films.
[02:55:40.606 --> 02:55:42.166]  I carry a bunch of other great videos.
[02:55:42.566 --> 02:55:44.567]  Jews, the Preservation of Farms, Ownership.
[02:55:44.627 --> 02:55:45.547]  I carry their video.

[02:56:40.585 --> 02:56:42.685]  Plus, these are great videos that will wake people up.
[02:56:43.125 --> 02:56:46.946]  Paul, a lot of new torture information coming out.
[02:56:47.766 --> 02:56:48.966]  This is out of the New York Times.
[02:56:49.046 --> 02:56:49.406]  G.I.
[02:56:49.466 --> 02:56:52.127]  pretends to be Gitmo inmate brutalized by guards.
[02:56:52.807 --> 02:56:54.427]  They told him it was just training.
[02:56:55.308 --> 02:56:57.328]  Army soldier, Specialist Baker,
[02:56:58.534 --> 02:57:17.400]  uh... and uh... thirty seven years old and they beat him up so bad that he now has seizures well again they gave him the code word you know for him to say for them to stop beating him he gave them the code word which was red and they continued beating him he you know pleaded help no stop i'm in the u.s.
[02:57:17.480 --> 02:57:18.300]  army i'm in the u.s.
[02:57:18.380 --> 02:57:24.362]  army they still you know continued to beat him and then only stopped after that so it just shows the mindset of these people
[02:57:24.970 --> 02:57:37.376]  Over in Britain, you've got the torture scandal where the newspaper editor was sacked for the fake photos, but then later on it came out that people in that exact regiment were involved and admitted to these people.
[02:57:37.396 --> 02:57:43.759]  And now it has MI6 linked to, they knew it was going to come out, so give the news some fake photos to then distract.
[02:57:44.472 --> 02:57:56.108]  Exactly, just as with the rape cases with Abu Ghraib, where it was admitted in the military report that rape went on, the CIA puts these fake photos on the internet, mixes the disinfo in, and, you know, the story's made.
[02:57:57.728 --> 02:57:59.109]  It's classic tactics.
[02:57:59.169 --> 02:58:00.750]  They have handbooks on this.
[02:58:00.831 --> 02:58:04.433]  We're trying to defend our country's sovereignty against the New World Order.
[02:58:04.774 --> 02:58:06.695]  Paul in England, myself here in the U.S.
[02:58:07.236 --> 02:58:10.398]  We're trying to defend our republics against enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:58:10.858 --> 02:58:13.681]  It's up to you to join us in this historical fight, my friends.
[02:58:14.201 --> 02:58:15.222]  Paul, thanks for coming on.
[02:58:15.642 --> 02:58:16.143]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:58:16.643 --> 02:58:17.744]  We'll see you next Monday.
[02:58:18.487 --> 02:58:21.210]  Paul joins us every Monday or Tuesday depending on the schedule.
[02:58:21.811 --> 02:58:29.339]  I'll be back tonight 9 to midnight central and back tomorrow 11 to 2 central with a lot of other great guests, your calls and a ton of vital news.
[02:58:29.900 --> 02:58:31.001]  So be sure to join us.
[02:58:31.041 --> 02:58:32.823]  Now get out there and take on the New World Order!
[02:58:36.610 --> 02:58:39.634]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:58:39.975 --> 02:58:48.786]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:58:49.127 --> 02:58:53.813]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:58:54.253 --> 02:59:00.976]  The Murky Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:59:01.376 --> 02:59:13.142]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:59:13.622 --> 02:59:18.084]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:59:18.264 --> 02:59:20.726]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:59:20.746 --> 02:59:22.566]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
