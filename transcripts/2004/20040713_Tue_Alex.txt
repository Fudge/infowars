[00:00:05.774 --> 00:00:10.037]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.617 --> 00:00:11.438]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:13.039]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.402]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.942 --> 00:00:22.085]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.652 --> 00:00:33.053]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.592]  It's already Tuesday, the 13th of July, 2004.
[00:00:37.632 --> 00:00:42.175]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:42.215 --> 00:00:46.679]  We'll be live for the next three hours here on this worldwide broadcast.
[00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:56.045]  And we have a group coming on that is a coalition of, what, over a dozen organizations
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:16.497]  uh... that are exposing the terry shyvoe schindler case the lady who's not in a coma who the media tried to claim was in a coma when she responds has her eyes open smiles laughs uh... to give you an update on this because we haven't talked about it a few months we'll look at about twenty thirty minutes of the second hour
[00:01:17.665 --> 00:01:32.995]  Paul Joseph Watson will join us at the bottom of the next hour and be with us for the rest of the broadcast for half of the transmission coming up at the halfway point in the middle of the next hour to cover a whole plethora of vital news and information.
[00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:37.918]  In this first hour and on to the second and third, we're going to have wide open telephones.
[00:01:37.978 --> 00:01:45.343]  Any issue you'd like to discuss, any news item you have a question or a comment about or something we haven't covered that you want to bring to the floor.
[00:01:46.368 --> 00:01:57.870]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and of course InfoWars.com and you'll see different news on all three of the sites.
[00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:10.973]  A lot of the same news but also different news and postings and audio and video so it's well worth your time to check out all three of the sites with a click of your mouse daily if you're on the computer online.
[00:02:12.393 --> 00:02:13.173]  Boy, I tell you,
[00:02:14.196 --> 00:02:19.180]  I want to get into suspending the election or postponing the election.
[00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:38.635]  Back in late May, over a month ago, we began to hear rumblings out of the Federal Elections Commission and other federal bodies about a movement to suspend the election.
[00:02:40.096 --> 00:02:41.817]  And even back in the mid-1980s with Rex 84,
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.023]  There were discussions that there were terrorist attacks or uprisings in the country.
[00:02:49.043 --> 00:02:55.848]  Of course, the government claimed it was communists that were going to do it, when in reality, the people that own America control the communists as well.
[00:02:55.888 --> 00:02:57.829]  It's kind of a crisis they create.
[00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.492]  Same thing with international terrorism being the new threat today.
[00:03:02.973 --> 00:03:04.694]  There were, you know, these communists everywhere.
[00:03:04.774 --> 00:03:08.396]  We might have to have martial law to counter them.
[00:03:08.457 --> 00:03:18.022]  Boy, the elite just hate robbing and ruling over us and putting in the same thing as a communist or command-and-control system in the name of stopping some type of communist takeover.
[00:03:18.403 --> 00:03:20.684]  So this has been going on for a long, long time.
[00:03:22.525 --> 00:03:28.449]  And surprisingly enough, last week the White House came out and discussed this, and it was in the Associated Press, and we covered it.
[00:03:29.572 --> 00:03:37.396]  That I've been on many talk shows the last week, and some of the talk shows, some of the listeners, were denying that this report even existed.
[00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:39.958]  You know, it's like the bills in Congress for a draft.
[00:03:40.418 --> 00:03:44.880]  We read the bill numbers, have links to it, and we're still conspiracy theorists.
[00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:57.787]  They have been announcing it, they have been doing it, but the denial really ended yesterday with a bunch of reports and Democrats, congressmen and women, on television saying they think it might be some type of conspiracy theory that
[00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.400]  Bush might be planning to cancel the election.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.800]  And you go, well, then what's really going on here?
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:10.463]  Because John Kerry and George Bush, John Forbes Kerry, George Walker Bush are cousins on both sides of their families.
[00:04:12.503 --> 00:04:22.026]  They, at the same time, not just both sides of their families, I mean, you know, their great-grandmothers are related, and their great-great-great-grandfathers are related.
[00:04:22.046 --> 00:04:23.947]  I mean, they're just, it's all interbred.
[00:04:23.967 --> 00:04:26.908]  It's a whole other subject.
[00:04:26.928 --> 00:04:27.428]  The point is,
[00:04:28.672 --> 00:04:30.253]  They're members of the same secret group.
[00:04:31.233 --> 00:04:34.954]  Carries for the war, for gun control, for open borders, for UNESCO.
[00:04:36.034 --> 00:04:36.675]  So is Bush.
[00:04:37.775 --> 00:04:40.396]  So, why then are they talking about suspending an election?
[00:04:40.416 --> 00:04:41.796]  We'll talk about that when we get back.
[00:04:42.336 --> 00:04:43.537]  Get into the latest developments.
[00:04:43.557 --> 00:04:50.079]  Homeland Security confirms election day talks, election delay talks, and much more.
[00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:52.660]  Just jam-packed key news and information.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.561]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, fighting tyranny, defending liberty.
[00:04:56.581 --> 00:04:57.001]  Stay with us.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.265]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.686 --> 00:05:13.910]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:21.197]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.557 --> 00:05:27.703]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.823 --> 00:05:29.044]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.364 --> 00:05:32.305]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:34.486]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:05:34.786 --> 00:05:42.029]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:05:42.329 --> 00:05:45.710]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[00:06:12.267 --> 00:06:19.852]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:20.092 --> 00:06:23.274]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:06:23.514 --> 00:06:29.238]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:06:29.738 --> 00:06:35.701]  Speaking of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:06:36.041 --> 00:06:39.962]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:06:40.002 --> 00:06:41.863]  The water level is always visible.
[00:06:42.083 --> 00:06:48.026]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.

[00:07:00.071 --> 00:07:05.374]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:07:05.574 --> 00:07:09.997]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:10.137 --> 00:07:14.499]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:15.920]  The New World Order.
[00:07:16.604 --> 00:07:17.886]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:31.544 --> 00:07:41.747]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:07:42.027 --> 00:07:47.409]  If you want to understand what the new order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:08:05.951 --> 00:08:06.592]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.252 --> 00:08:08.333]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.034 --> 00:08:10.175]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.795 --> 00:08:11.636]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.376 --> 00:08:13.237]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.257 --> 00:08:17.661]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.121 --> 00:08:22.244]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:27.889 --> 00:08:28.890]  All right, my friends.
[00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:35.355]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight Central, I'm your host here, Alex Jones.
[00:08:38.098 --> 00:08:54.132]  And let us now dive straight into the news and information as we battle this global crime syndicate known as the New World Order that is attempting to dumb us all down and subjugate us under the threat of terrorism into a worldwide police state.
[00:08:56.034 --> 00:09:00.358]  Homeland Security confirms election delay talks
[00:09:02.119 --> 00:09:05.981]  And this is from the Voice of America, the government.
[00:09:06.401 --> 00:09:16.265]  The Department of Homeland Security has confirmed that the Bush administration has discussed possibly delaying the November presidential election if there is a new terrorist attack.
[00:09:16.845 --> 00:09:23.628]  The report in Newsweek, and confirmed Monday, says the discussion was spurred by a letter from U.S.
[00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:27.530]  Election Assistant Commission Chairman DeFrost Soares.
[00:09:28.524 --> 00:09:33.890]  Newsweek says, we talked about this a month and a half ago, but Newsweek always breaks everything.
[00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:37.634]  Like the New York Times told us about a group called Bilderberg last week.
[00:09:38.535 --> 00:09:40.578]  They have broken the story of it.
[00:09:40.918 --> 00:09:45.483]  How they were the ones that decided to have a vice president candidate
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.741]  John Edwards, man, you're such a journalist.
[00:09:50.241 --> 00:10:01.144]  Newsweek says Mr. Soares wrote Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge to suggest asking Congress for emergency legislation to allow postponing of the election after any attack.
[00:10:01.544 --> 00:10:04.045]  Well, the AP article last week said that.
[00:10:04.745 --> 00:10:06.126]  Newsweek, you didn't break anything.
[00:10:06.206 --> 00:10:09.527]  I'm sick of the media not crediting people correctly.
[00:10:09.847 --> 00:10:11.567]  Newsweek, I don't think it's ever broken anything.
[00:10:11.887 --> 00:10:13.408]  They just grab stuff from the AP.
[00:10:16.781 --> 00:10:28.666]  But the Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, California's Christopher Cox, told CNN Sunday the request was a prudent effort to plan for what he called doomsday scenarios.
[00:10:30.026 --> 00:10:38.650]  Now again, I always love it how at some commission, a blue ribbon panel of experts, totally unpartisan, recommends this.
[00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:45.573]  Of course, they don't mention here that the Election Assistance Commission
[00:10:46.374 --> 00:10:54.356]  was created three years ago by Lord Bush and that the U.S.
[00:10:54.456 --> 00:11:14.722]  Election Assistance Commission got the five billion dollars, they asked for six, but they ended up getting a little over five billion dollars for the Voter Assistance Act and they run around paying off publicly, publicly of course, all out in the open as usual, local county clerks
[00:11:16.528 --> 00:11:29.151]  And attorney generals and others in your states to put in the electronic fraud boxes publicly run by the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:42.835]  Well, that's who runs the major, I keep saying three companies, the major four are all run by former directors or deputy directors or former heads of NSA and their employees are CIA officers and they're in armored compounds with men with short haircuts walking around in
[00:11:44.015 --> 00:11:48.336]  Black suits with black ties, with men in the parking lots with machine guns.
[00:11:48.516 --> 00:11:49.857]  But again, it's all part of the freedom.
[00:11:50.657 --> 00:11:52.057]  All part of the freedom, all part of the freedom.
[00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:54.718]  I mean, I'm ready to just go cuckoo, folks.
[00:11:54.838 --> 00:11:57.678]  I mean, this is just getting more and more ridiculous by the millisecond.
[00:11:58.959 --> 00:12:07.721]  And this commission was appointed by Lord Bush, just like the Independent 9-11 Commission, just like Janet Reno appointing the Waco Commission.
[00:12:09.546 --> 00:12:11.887]  And, uh, so independent!
[00:12:12.008 --> 00:12:18.171]  I mean, again, it's like Adolf Hitler appointing Heinrich Himmler to run the Nuremberg Trials against him.
[00:12:19.552 --> 00:12:21.293]  I mean, I guess we're going to buy into this!
[00:12:21.773 --> 00:12:24.655]  It's like having Khrushchev investigate Stalin!
[00:12:26.356 --> 00:12:28.537]  It's, it's, um... I understand.
[00:12:28.617 --> 00:12:30.218]  I know Khrushchev was against Stalin.
[00:12:30.338 --> 00:12:31.139]  I understand.
[00:12:31.299 --> 00:12:31.779]  Oh, boy.
[00:12:31.799 --> 00:12:35.201]  Uh, just please, people, it's getting...
[00:12:36.827 --> 00:12:39.308]  That's the problem with this situation!
[00:12:40.929 --> 00:12:47.373]  I mean, yes, the government can say, shouldn't we have national emergency preparations ready in case we're attacked by terrorists?
[00:12:48.253 --> 00:12:53.676]  Well, I mean, in a perfect world of angels around the government, but angels don't run the government.
[00:12:53.996 --> 00:13:05.522]  The people in the government, whether they be Democrat or Republican, are all a bunch of gun-grabbing, American-hating, terrorist-funding lunatics.
[00:13:07.142 --> 00:13:20.425]  I mean, those in power, committee chairmen and above, the major committees, and the Supreme Court, and the executive, all of these people are sickening slobs.
[00:13:21.365 --> 00:13:30.727]  By slobs, they are gutting America, sucking it dry, the blood of the country, the live blood splattering about their swollen, demonic faces.
[00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:37.055]  And to watch Ridge stomping around, just oozing, oozing evil.
[00:13:37.095 --> 00:13:43.620]  I mean, you can look at him and see how evil he is, and Bush, and Snickering Kerry, and all of them.
[00:13:44.161 --> 00:13:46.202]  I mean, it's just on the surface.
[00:13:46.543 --> 00:13:52.227]  If I saw somebody walking like that, whether they were in a suit or not, in a dark alley, I would shrink away from them.
[00:13:53.669 --> 00:13:57.212]  They just radiate a vampiric aura.
[00:13:58.333 --> 00:13:59.113]  And I use that in a
[00:14:00.552 --> 00:14:03.293]  Figurative term, I don't mean that literally.
[00:14:05.894 --> 00:14:21.919]  But again, it's not just that they have this horror of serial killers, of fiends, it's that their actions are fiendish, cunning, wicked, calculating, dismantling the country, looting the country, looting the treasury,
[00:14:22.708 --> 00:14:50.215]  Bribery, scamming in the trillions of dollars, mass embezzlement, greedy destruction of freedom, federalization of major cities, huge FEMA command bunkers, brimming with CIA and troops, publicly from Maine to Texas, and they're now, the top generals spouting off on a weekly basis about, martial law is actually good, Big Brother is actually good, all the definitions being, you know,
[00:14:51.014 --> 00:15:12.032]  altered meanings of words being changed, a pack of giggling neocons in the streets worshipping their leaders, worshipping big government, worshipping the destruction of America, worshipping Rush Limbaugh, worshipping Michael Weiner, Michael Savage, worshipping Sean Hannity, worshipping, worshipping, worshipping, worshipping lies!
[00:15:12.052 --> 00:15:17.157]  Remember in the last two months why they found nerve gas shells on the side of the road?
[00:15:19.204 --> 00:15:21.745]  You know, Saddam was shipping out weapons of mass destruction.
[00:15:21.846 --> 00:15:29.950]  All those reports turned out, as usual, to be false, like the, I don't know, 50 to 100, I haven't counted them up, it's over 50 fake reports of the past.
[00:15:31.171 --> 00:15:38.595]  Just wall-to-wall criminality, foaming at the mouth, running around, just butchering everything.
[00:15:39.295 --> 00:15:41.256]  Giant control grids going in.
[00:15:43.698 --> 00:15:45.599]  And the average American doesn't know
[00:15:46.607 --> 00:15:48.408]  Who the Vice President is, did you know that?
[00:15:48.989 --> 00:15:51.991]  The average American doesn't know how many states there are.
[00:15:52.671 --> 00:15:57.674]  The average American cannot list more than ten state capitals, in many cases five state capitals.
[00:15:58.035 --> 00:15:59.916]  They don't know how many continents there are.
[00:16:00.016 --> 00:16:02.558]  They can't find Iraq on a large globe.
[00:16:02.598 --> 00:16:04.959]  I mean, I'm talking about professionals, people.
[00:16:06.721 --> 00:16:08.061]  We read these studies all the time.
[00:16:08.962 --> 00:16:10.903]  They don't know anything.
[00:16:11.364 --> 00:16:12.064]  They don't know
[00:16:13.863 --> 00:16:18.205]  They don't know where power comes from when it comes out of their lightbulb in the form of light.
[00:16:19.085 --> 00:16:22.187]  They don't know where TV broadcasts come from.
[00:16:22.887 --> 00:16:23.647]  Ask these people.
[00:16:23.787 --> 00:16:26.028]  Ask these educated idiots.
[00:16:26.989 --> 00:16:30.710]  They don't know how to skin a buck or run a trot line.
[00:16:30.891 --> 00:16:33.932]  They don't know how to change a tire.
[00:16:34.747 --> 00:16:39.771]  They don't know anything but how to act cool at the country club.
[00:16:40.211 --> 00:16:46.295]  And if they're a hippie, they just know how to say, turn your guns into the government, they'll take good care of you.
[00:16:47.016 --> 00:16:52.940]  Being disarmed was real good for the Native Americans, and black slaves couldn't own guns, so why should we?
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.441]  Well, no, they don't actually say that.
[00:16:54.461 --> 00:16:58.944]  That's how they should see gun control, as the slave master slave position.
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:05.465]  But just, you people better wake up, because I'm not even the sharpest knife in the drawer.
[00:17:06.585 --> 00:17:16.653]  Sometimes I wonder if my elevator goes all the way to the top, but compared to you, compared to some of you, at least I'm a human being.
[00:17:16.733 --> 00:17:19.796]  You people don't have the smarts of a possum.
[00:17:23.098 --> 00:17:24.960]  Your brains are possum-like.
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:26.561]  Alright, I just,
[00:17:27.472 --> 00:17:29.513]  This is how I really feel about everything, folks.
[00:17:29.893 --> 00:17:31.814]  I... I... Oh, man.
[00:17:32.094 --> 00:17:40.999]  I just... Tyranny... When they start talking about martial law, and suspending elections, and terrorists are going to blow the Capitol up, for sure.
[00:17:41.359 --> 00:17:41.919]  You know, U.S.
[00:17:41.939 --> 00:17:44.501]  News & World Report, the White House told us, blah, blah, blah.
[00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:47.262]  Foreign troops may keep us safe.
[00:17:47.402 --> 00:17:51.424]  You know, we may have foreign troops patrolling American streets for your safety.
[00:17:52.585 --> 00:17:56.347]  We're gonna... I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:17:58.653 --> 00:18:01.858]  It's just they are doing this to get you ready for it.
[00:18:02.899 --> 00:18:03.861]  And let me tell you something.
[00:18:05.683 --> 00:18:10.511]  These yuppies and people that think all this is funny.
[00:18:13.195 --> 00:18:14.036]  Let me tell them something.
[00:18:15.305 --> 00:18:27.140]  I know that as things get worse in this country, you're going to cling to the government, beg the government, love, parrot, put out 15 plastic flags in your yard made by slaves, desecrated American flags, and think you're patriotic.
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:34.169]  I know you'll grovel to the system, grovel to the state, like demonic baby birds, begging.
[00:18:34.961 --> 00:18:36.622]  And you think that'll keep you safe.
[00:18:36.742 --> 00:18:46.089]  As things get worse, you think groveling, volunteering to be a tattletale, getting a petty power position, you think that will protect you.
[00:18:46.189 --> 00:18:47.690]  And it will not protect you.
[00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:49.451]  You cowardly trash.
[00:18:50.512 --> 00:18:51.493]  And I know you're listening.
[00:18:52.142 --> 00:18:53.563]  You know what I'm telling you is true.
[00:18:53.603 --> 00:18:54.464]  You know it's tyranny.
[00:18:54.744 --> 00:18:58.608]  And so you make a split-second decision to giggle about it and to grovel at the feet of it.
[00:18:58.948 --> 00:19:00.810]  That goes for you too, corrupt police.
[00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:10.198]  That goes for you, government officials and authorities who call us civilians here in the new military dictatorship.
[00:19:11.779 --> 00:19:13.461]  I know you think it's all real funny.
[00:19:13.501 --> 00:19:15.002]  Well, it's not funny.
[00:19:16.403 --> 00:19:28.448]  The destruction of America and the establishment of the most high-tech, oppressive, police-state Orwellian system ever known in world history is saddening.
[00:19:29.928 --> 00:19:33.430]  And it will hurt all of us, whether we fight it or we serve it.
[00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:39.452]  And so, shame on you, you cowardly filth.
[00:19:40.913 --> 00:19:45.615]  Shame on you, you bloody dogs.
[00:19:47.324 --> 00:19:55.265]  You are a bunch of worms, self-hating, willfully ignorant cowards.
[00:19:55.305 --> 00:19:55.967]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:03.177 --> 00:20:04.218]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:20:04.558 --> 00:20:07.341]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:20:07.602 --> 00:20:11.766]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:20:12.186 --> 00:20:13.027]  So what do you do?
[00:20:13.347 --> 00:20:17.912]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:20:18.396 --> 00:20:20.517]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:20:20.997 --> 00:20:35.705]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:20:35.745 --> 00:20:42.809]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:20:49.794 --> 00:20:50.075]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:20:50.095 --> 00:20:51.576]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:21:01.121 --> 00:21:02.643]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:03.945]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:21:04.125 --> 00:21:07.530]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:08.070]  Phenol!
[00:21:08.391 --> 00:21:15.460]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:21:16.001 --> 00:21:19.862]  The FDA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:21:20.002 --> 00:21:20.442]  Fragrance?
[00:21:20.822 --> 00:21:25.584]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:21:25.724 --> 00:21:30.405]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[00:21:30.625 --> 00:21:33.186]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my CalBen shampoo.
[00:21:33.446 --> 00:21:36.847]  Well, like all of the products from the CalBen Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:21:37.007 --> 00:21:40.508]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:21:40.748 --> 00:21:43.129]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:21:43.269 --> 00:21:44.170]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:22:07.874 --> 00:22:10.937]  What kinds of investments will be able to withstand an economic meltdown?
[00:22:11.077 --> 00:22:13.620]  The problem is, it's not always easy to find great solutions.

[00:23:01.636 --> 00:23:03.937]  My family's breathing easier, and now you can too!
[00:23:04.117 --> 00:23:07.458]  Hey folks, Michael Trubel here to tell you about the Biozone Air Purifier.
[00:23:07.558 --> 00:23:09.779]  The Biozone Air Purifier is not a filter system.
[00:23:09.939 --> 00:23:15.921]  It works at the molecular level, binding the small bits of dust, allergens, and other particles in your air into clumps that are too heavy to float.
[00:23:16.121 --> 00:23:18.701]  They fall harmlessly to the floor to be literally swept away.
[00:23:18.961 --> 00:23:19.622]  Nothing escapes!
[00:23:19.742 --> 00:23:23.963]  The Biozone Air Purifier also kills virus and bacteria germs and totally removes odors.
[00:23:24.143 --> 00:23:27.764]  Out on the farm we have several cats and two big dogs, so pet odors can be a concern.
[00:23:27.864 --> 00:23:30.085]  But like the odors from anything else, simply gone.
[00:23:30.405 --> 00:23:30.665]  Smoke?
[00:23:30.905 --> 00:23:32.766]  My wife and I don't, but several of our friends do.
[00:23:32.946 --> 00:23:36.007]  Our BioZone Air Purifier clears out that smoke literally within minutes.
[00:23:36.227 --> 00:23:40.348]  I use it myself, and I'm telling you, your BioZone Air Purifier will improve the air in your home.
[00:23:40.508 --> 00:23:43.148]  It even comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee and free shipping.
[00:23:43.328 --> 00:23:46.109]  Call toll-free, 888-88-MY-AIR today.
[00:23:46.209 --> 00:23:48.550]  That's 1-888-88-MY-AIR.
[00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:51.631]  Or visit www.purifymyair.com.
[00:23:51.691 --> 00:23:53.331]  That's purifymyair.com.

[00:23:56.952 --> 00:23:59.913]  Get your BioZone Air Purifier today, and you'll be breathing easier, too.
[00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:09.721]  All right, your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:09.761 --> 00:24:16.846]  Mike and Paul and Mike and Jim and George and many, many others told a free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:24:17.027 --> 00:24:26.054]  And I wasn't speaking to 95% of our audience, but the sniveling types out there that have decided to join this system out of fear.
[00:24:27.706 --> 00:24:31.607]  Those that are experts at doublethink, just shame on you.
[00:24:31.887 --> 00:24:37.188]  I mean, there's no end to what you won't buy into, what you won't go along with.
[00:24:39.009 --> 00:24:43.990]  And there's several editorials about the suspension of the elections that are being discussed.
[00:24:46.171 --> 00:24:54.313]  And it's very, very scary to see Governor Rootage up there.
[00:24:54.353 --> 00:24:55.773]  I mean, he's just so evil.
[00:24:57.381 --> 00:24:58.922]  He's smiling at us now.
[00:24:58.942 --> 00:25:09.010]  You know, we've had elections during the Civil War, elections during World War II, but if the terrorists attack, we can't have elections.
[00:25:09.691 --> 00:25:12.113]  Oh, funny, the government's been preparing for this long before 9-11.
[00:25:12.233 --> 00:25:19.458]  And then, oh, when you look at who was behind 9-11, it was the very military-industrial complex taking over the entire economy.
[00:25:19.498 --> 00:25:22.681]  It isn't enough to loot the Pentagon of a trillion-two.
[00:25:23.782 --> 00:25:26.464]  Now, a trillion-two plus, and no one gets in trouble.
[00:25:27.051 --> 00:25:37.740]  You know, some captain who steals $3,000 off the credit card gets a felony charge and a couple years in prison, as they should, but the corporation steals trillions and nothing happens.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:42.183]  See, and now the criminals are going, we're getting away with this, let's run wild!
[00:25:42.243 --> 00:25:47.307]  See, the New World Order is so the criminals have their world government to feed on you at their leisure.
[00:25:48.629 --> 00:25:49.689]  And there's never an end to it.
[00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:51.651]  There's never enough for tyrants.
[00:25:51.671 --> 00:25:52.792]  They always want more.
[00:25:54.068 --> 00:26:00.893]  Homeland Security worried about threat fatigue, considers revamping system to keep you afraid, New York Times.
[00:26:01.893 --> 00:26:11.000]  The federal government's color-coded threat system is too vague and confusing to help many local and state law enforcement officials prepare for possible terrorist attacks.
[00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.281]  Of course, that's our headline we wrote.
[00:26:12.741 --> 00:26:18.685]  Congressional investigators said Monday in a report that prompted leading members of Congress to call for an overhaul.
[00:26:19.867 --> 00:26:21.929]  Yeah, it doesn't scare people properly.
[00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:35.725]  The report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, cited widespread concern among federal, state, and local officials about the quality and timing of threat information they received from the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:26:36.306 --> 00:26:43.528]  A survey sent to 84 agencies, states, and United States territories as part of the study found that the warnings were often vague and inadequate.
[00:26:43.868 --> 00:26:46.009]  Well, the terrorists can't tell us when they're going to strike.
[00:26:46.029 --> 00:26:49.750]  You don't expect Ridge to tell us when his bosses are going to strike us, do you?
[00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:51.250]  I mean, it's vague.
[00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:53.491]  They're going to hit us for sure, but no specifics.
[00:26:53.531 --> 00:26:54.051]  Very vague.
[00:26:55.632 --> 00:27:00.193]  Very vague how Bush ordered FBI not to stop Al-Qaeda, and that's very specific.
[00:27:03.164 --> 00:27:10.552]  And it continues, and had hindered their ability to determine whether they were at risk and what protective measures to take in response.
[00:27:10.772 --> 00:27:12.614]  Well, it just teaches you how to be federalized.
[00:27:12.654 --> 00:27:13.595]  That's the whole point of this.
[00:27:14.376 --> 00:27:15.957]  But the billboards are going to flash.
[00:27:16.058 --> 00:27:18.100]  The AMBER alert was never defined.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.501]  Lost children, they now admit.
[00:27:19.882 --> 00:27:24.046]  Back in the 80s, I've even had the former FCC top lawyer on, who's now a private professor.
[00:27:25.061 --> 00:27:26.362]  And I had him on a few years ago.
[00:27:26.422 --> 00:27:42.927]  It was meant to be a control grid and government announcements and people at local stations laughed at me five years ago and now they're saying, Alex, the Texas Association of Broadcasters at the meeting, they said the government wants to take program time every day and break in whenever they want with announcements about gun control and the environment.
[00:27:43.067 --> 00:27:44.008]  Oh, yes!
[00:27:44.128 --> 00:27:45.008]  Yes!
[00:27:45.868 --> 00:27:48.269]  Yes, nationwide, you'll be enjoying it.
[00:27:49.089 --> 00:27:50.410]  Soviet-style news.
[00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:53.811]  Well, after all the terrorists have hit us, we've got to do it.
[00:27:54.545 --> 00:28:04.452]  Representative Christopher Cox, the California Republican who leads the House Homeland Security Committee, said in releasing a report that the officials overseeing the threat system needed to make it work better or get rid of it.
[00:28:04.872 --> 00:28:13.358]  Mr. Cox, Representative Jim Turner of Texas, the ranking Democrat on the panel, said the panel was at risk, the public was at risk for threat fatigue.
[00:28:15.549 --> 00:28:21.270]  I'm afraid if we don't make improvements in the system, Mr. Turner said, the public's going to lose trust and confidence in the system.
[00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:22.210]  Oh, don't worry.
[00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:25.551]  They're getting ready to give us some reasons to pay more attention to it.
[00:28:26.631 --> 00:28:38.453]  Many people criticized the government and the Patriot Act before the nuke went off, and now we have the national draft, and hail our leaders, and many conservative talk show hosts have called for arresting those who disagree with the government.
[00:28:38.473 --> 00:28:39.093]  We're laughed at.
[00:28:39.233 --> 00:28:43.074]  Now they, now they are being praised.
[00:28:43.154 --> 00:28:44.174]  They'll bring us freedom.
[00:28:45.501 --> 00:28:53.309]  Those that criticized the government aided Al Qaeda and caused a million five deaths in the weaponized smallpox outbreak of 05.
[00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:58.935]  But the gracious leader Lord Kerry led the fight against them.
[00:29:00.387 --> 00:29:06.511]  An alliance between Conservatives and Kerry, before the horrible nuke and bio-attack, was unthought of.
[00:29:06.891 --> 00:29:20.639]  But now, now when it was learned that left-wing and right-wing elements were working with Al-Qaeda at grassroots, the peace activist and right-wing Christian zealots are being arrested and sent to work camps to pay their fair share.
[00:29:21.399 --> 00:29:24.261]  They... against the homeland.
[00:29:26.324 --> 00:29:32.649]  Remember I used to talk about how they might suspend the election, how they're talking about martial law, how all this is starting to happen?
[00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:34.791]  You really want to see this happen?
[00:29:37.132 --> 00:29:39.034]  All the talk show hosts now, they're all on the radio.
[00:29:39.334 --> 00:29:41.796]  Arrest those that disagree with the government, arrest those that disagree with the government.
[00:29:41.996 --> 00:29:43.377]  They're gonna cause Al Qaeda to strike.
[00:29:43.417 --> 00:29:44.918]  It's gonna be their fault when it happens.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.541]  Oh, but who are the real terrorists?
[00:29:49.382 --> 00:29:50.342]  Be right back with your calls.
[00:29:51.824 --> 00:29:52.764]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.225 --> 00:29:54.726]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.878 --> 00:30:06.726]  I'm a nurse and I injured my back and I've lost 22 pounds and 9 inches.
[00:30:06.986 --> 00:30:09.108]  I would definitely recommend Vim and Vigor.
[00:30:09.648 --> 00:30:14.232]  As far as losing weight, Vim and Vigor is the best investment I ever made.
[00:30:14.552 --> 00:30:15.893]  It actually works.
[00:30:16.315 --> 00:30:19.757]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[00:30:19.777 --> 00:30:21.298]  I've tried many, many products.
[00:30:21.458 --> 00:30:23.739]  I have never experienced anything like Collagenate.
[00:30:24.079 --> 00:30:27.701]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than eight weeks.
[00:30:28.141 --> 00:30:28.782]  It truly works.
[00:30:29.102 --> 00:30:30.482]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[00:30:30.723 --> 00:30:36.445]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:30:36.526 --> 00:30:42.349]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[00:30:42.469 --> 00:30:45.050]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate really does work.
[00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:46.472]  It's healthy for you, too.
[00:30:46.652 --> 00:30:47.653]  Call Vim and Vigor today.
[00:30:47.673 --> 00:30:47.914]  1-800-622-FIN.
[00:30:47.994 --> 00:30:48.214]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:30:48.254 --> 00:30:49.536]  Get $25 off a 3-month supply of collagenate.
[00:30:49.556 --> 00:30:50.056]  So call now.
[00:30:50.076 --> 00:30:50.197]  1-800-622-FIN.
[00:30:50.217 --> 00:30:50.417]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[00:31:01.986 --> 00:31:03.606]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:03.746 --> 00:31:07.868]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:07.988 --> 00:31:10.868]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:10.948 --> 00:31:17.670]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:20.851]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:31:21.051 --> 00:31:23.452]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:31:23.572 --> 00:31:28.293]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[00:31:28.473 --> 00:31:37.797]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur.
[00:31:37.937 --> 00:31:43.040]  Even Nitrates and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.

[00:32:02.995 --> 00:32:03.976]  Spring has arrived!
[00:32:04.156 --> 00:32:07.116]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:32:07.356 --> 00:32:10.797]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:32:11.017 --> 00:32:19.159]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:32:19.419 --> 00:32:23.160]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.

[00:33:02.538 --> 00:33:05.279]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:05.299 --> 00:33:09.141]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:19.236 --> 00:33:21.717]  All right, my friends, we're about to go to your phone calls.
[00:33:24.558 --> 00:33:28.399]  And then we'll get into more on their plans to suspend the election.
[00:33:28.439 --> 00:33:29.039]  Will they do it?
[00:33:29.059 --> 00:33:31.320]  They're certainly talking about it.
[00:33:33.241 --> 00:33:36.102]  Also, Congress should slam the door on email snoops.
[00:33:36.122 --> 00:33:37.582]  This is out of the Sun-Herald.
[00:33:38.062 --> 00:33:39.583]  Red Cross fears U.S.
[00:33:39.683 --> 00:33:40.963]  is hiding detainees.
[00:33:41.363 --> 00:33:42.664]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:33:43.675 --> 00:33:59.347]  The Red Cross fears the CIA and the Washington Post and other publications two years ago bragged that they were, quote, taking people to Jordan and Egypt and other third-party countries where they could, quote, torture them and their children.
[00:34:01.449 --> 00:34:03.050]  In fact, I know Paul Watson's listening.
[00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:08.214]  Paul, with this article, you ought to, at the bottom of it, post that Washington Post article.
[00:34:08.474 --> 00:34:11.777]  I know we've got that in the torture section on the website so people can see that.
[00:34:12.475 --> 00:34:14.736]  Again, this is the Orwellian nature of the news.
[00:34:15.456 --> 00:34:16.316]  It's all admitted.
[00:34:16.356 --> 00:34:19.317]  You heard them say torture was good years ago.
[00:34:19.457 --> 00:34:22.638]  And then when they get caught and you see the images, we never said that.
[00:34:22.718 --> 00:34:23.958]  Why, we didn't torture.
[00:34:24.398 --> 00:34:25.959]  So they've got folks all over the planet.
[00:34:26.919 --> 00:34:29.200]  And now what we told you was in the Army Report has come out.
[00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:31.360]  The torture of children, people's children.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.481]  And I mean 10-year-olds, 12-year-olds, 5-year-olds.
[00:34:35.021 --> 00:34:37.442]  How do you support that, you sickos?
[00:34:38.385 --> 00:34:44.629]  The people out there that we've all heard on the radio promoting torture, and now they don't want to talk about it.
[00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:46.650]  No, they don't want to talk about it.
[00:34:48.031 --> 00:34:51.453]  Also, later I want to read the 14 signposts to slavery.
[00:34:52.933 --> 00:34:55.195]  We'll go over these.
[00:34:55.915 --> 00:34:57.436]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:34:57.456 --> 00:34:59.457]  There's a lot of censorship going on.
[00:34:59.497 --> 00:35:02.739]  The number one hip-hop artist
[00:35:05.288 --> 00:35:13.934]  Jadakis, I hope I'm not mispronouncing that, but he has the number one single out right now, says, why did Bush knock down the towers?
[00:35:15.255 --> 00:35:20.299]  And he said, look, I live in New York, most people in New York, and he has his quotes right here, think the government did it?
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:30.967]  And so radio stations are editing it out, and MTV is editing it out, and so there you have it.
[00:35:32.077 --> 00:35:35.061]  Oh, most people in New York think the government did it.
[00:35:35.161 --> 00:35:36.383]  Number one song right now.
[00:35:36.503 --> 00:35:37.124]  Number one.
[00:35:37.144 --> 00:35:37.885]  Number one.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.701]  Whatcha gonna do, bad boys, bad boys?
[00:35:47.941 --> 00:35:48.881]  Whatcha gonna do?
[00:35:49.202 --> 00:35:51.622]  Whatcha gonna do when we come for you?
[00:35:51.642 --> 00:35:53.183]  Whatcha gonna do?
[00:35:53.523 --> 00:35:56.164]  Whatcha gonna do when they say the world is round?
[00:35:56.204 --> 00:35:58.945]  You've been saying it's flat for a long, long time.
[00:35:59.245 --> 00:36:02.707]  But now we're going to kick you in your behind!
[00:36:03.627 --> 00:36:04.367]  Alright, folks.
[00:36:06.468 --> 00:36:11.810]  My own little... My own little rap there for the New World Order.
[00:36:12.583 --> 00:36:16.864]  But seriously, what are you going to do, New World Order, when we come for you?
[00:36:17.424 --> 00:36:22.585]  When the number one songs out there in the popular culture say you did it?
[00:36:23.325 --> 00:36:24.766]  What are you going to do?
[00:36:25.786 --> 00:36:28.027]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Pennsylvania.
[00:36:28.107 --> 00:36:29.327]  Mike, go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:36:29.347 --> 00:36:30.907]  Hey, yes, Alex.
[00:36:31.187 --> 00:36:37.989]  I just wanted to mention, I went to a university that I won't mention which one, but I wanted to look at their budget reports.
[00:36:39.261 --> 00:36:42.253]  I saw one of your videos and I thought I'll go down and look myself.
[00:36:43.499 --> 00:36:44.940]  I'd like to say something to your caller.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.041]  Okay, well give folks some background.
[00:36:47.061 --> 00:36:50.363]  You saw comprehensive annual financial reports exposed.
[00:36:50.383 --> 00:36:51.344]  The video I don't really promote.
[00:36:51.384 --> 00:36:52.044]  It's great stuff.
[00:36:52.404 --> 00:37:01.050]  Pretty dry though, but it's really informative about a double set of books that counties, cities, and the states have set up in the fifties, starting in Chicago.
[00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:02.631]  It's unified fraud.
[00:37:03.011 --> 00:37:04.712]  Seventy plus percent of the stock market.
[00:37:04.832 --> 00:37:09.395]  Oh Alex, Alex, I mean... Okay, but just since you mentioned it, I want to give folks some background.
[00:37:09.415 --> 00:37:09.715]  Go ahead.
[00:37:09.955 --> 00:37:10.135]  Right.
[00:37:10.175 --> 00:37:12.457]  No, I mean, you say it's like not that big a deal.
[00:37:12.617 --> 00:37:13.398]  It's everything.
[00:37:13.478 --> 00:37:15.059]  It's the biggest deal, I think.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.562]  I mean, I think this is the biggest deal of everything.
[00:37:19.282 --> 00:37:20.043]  But in any case... No, no, no.
[00:37:20.083 --> 00:37:21.024]  I think it's a big deal.
[00:37:21.104 --> 00:37:23.065]  I'm just saying it's my driest video.
[00:37:23.085 --> 00:37:23.445]  Go ahead.
[00:37:24.166 --> 00:37:24.887]  Okay.
[00:37:25.347 --> 00:37:26.168]  A point well taken.
[00:37:26.228 --> 00:37:30.051]  I went down to the university and I went to... and it's public information.
[00:37:30.071 --> 00:37:33.133]  I think a lot of your callers should do this.
[00:37:33.293 --> 00:37:37.036]  And I'd like to point out to the callers that I appreciate when they call in
[00:37:37.638 --> 00:37:39.520]  With a lot of their information and things like that.
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:40.581]  You have great guests on.
[00:37:40.601 --> 00:37:47.726]  And as a member of Prism Planet dot TV, could I request that you put that David Dyke, uh, David, uh, Ike, I'm sorry, uh, interview up from yesterday.
[00:37:47.807 --> 00:37:48.367]  Great guest.
[00:37:49.028 --> 00:37:49.688]  Uh, it is up.
[00:37:50.429 --> 00:37:50.869]  Oh, okay.
[00:37:50.989 --> 00:37:51.329]  I'm sorry.
[00:37:51.369 --> 00:37:52.130]  I didn't look at it.
[00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:58.675]  Uh, in any case, I looked at their budget reports and, and me and a, um, guy used to be the president of the university.
[00:37:59.356 --> 00:38:03.079]  Uh, look at the budget report and it took us a little bit to find the revenues.
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:04.280]  Okay.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.261]  But what they were doing,
[00:38:05.994 --> 00:38:09.577]  Is they would take about 10% of their yearly revenues.
[00:38:10.057 --> 00:38:15.381]  I think, I think, um, they made something like $226 million that year.
[00:38:16.042 --> 00:38:16.382]  Okay.
[00:38:16.482 --> 00:38:25.770]  And they took about $23.7 in 03 and then something like $26 million after they raised tuition in 04 and they put them in these two slush funds.
[00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:27.211]  Okay.
[00:38:27.311 --> 00:38:31.514]  And, and it was probably a total of, you know, $50 million in the last two years.
[00:38:31.534 --> 00:38:33.956]  And, and, and they would put them in these slush funds.
[00:38:34.372 --> 00:38:39.595]  And if you look at the budgets from those slush funds, that's basically like a one-way tunnel.
[00:38:39.695 --> 00:38:46.518]  Money goes out of the university, never comes back in, they invest it, there's probably in the tens of billions in those slush funds.
[00:38:46.738 --> 00:38:48.159]  Well that's... Let me stop you.
[00:38:48.179 --> 00:38:48.819]  Go ahead.
[00:38:49.459 --> 00:38:56.563]  There are over 10,000 government, or quasi-government groups, counties, cities, school districts,
[00:38:57.538 --> 00:39:04.960]  Do you know how much UT has in the public budget slush fund, not the off-budget Comprehensive Annual Financial Report Fund?
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:06.160]  No sir, I don't.
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.601]  University of Texas at Austin, biggest university in the country.
[00:39:09.421 --> 00:39:13.942]  Guess how much it has in the public, transparent, cream budget.
[00:39:13.962 --> 00:39:15.922]  1.2 billion, I'll take it as a lucky guess.
[00:39:15.942 --> 00:39:16.482]  24 plus billion.
[00:39:16.522 --> 00:39:16.762]  Okay.
[00:39:24.716 --> 00:39:26.538]  I got one more question.
[00:39:26.578 --> 00:39:29.000]  Now, do you know how much they have off-budget?
[00:39:30.621 --> 00:39:31.982]  I would imagine it'd be more.
[00:39:32.683 --> 00:39:39.328]  Well, when I checked it three years ago, it was over a hundred and twenty billion dollars.
[00:39:40.489 --> 00:39:48.536]  And, when you go to UT, until you are a graduate student, you never see, I'm not joking, you will rarely see anyone who speaks English.
[00:39:48.576 --> 00:39:49.437]  You are taught nothing.
[00:39:49.457 --> 00:39:50.878]  You're given horrible textbooks.
[00:39:51.882 --> 00:39:55.723]  They raise tuition every year.
[00:39:56.844 --> 00:39:59.164]  They mercilessly feed on the students.
[00:39:59.645 --> 00:40:06.947]  People pay on average something like $80,000 to get a four year degree from this cesspool.
[00:40:08.141 --> 00:40:14.202]  And guess where the money goes from the UT public slush fund, the one they admit, the $24 million one?
[00:40:14.582 --> 00:40:24.625]  It went to start the Rangers, you know, to buy into that, it went to help set up Clear Channel, and it is the private cash machine of the neocons here locally.
[00:40:26.545 --> 00:40:29.065]  I wanted to point out one more thing, if you would, please.
[00:40:29.406 --> 00:40:32.686]  The word anti-Semitism, I think, is really, really misused.
[00:40:32.886 --> 00:40:36.387]  I understand a semi... someone from the Middle Eastern region
[00:40:37.562 --> 00:40:48.876]  And for someone to say that someone's an anti-Semite because they're either anti-Israeli nationalist or anti-Jew, I think that's way off base and misrepresented, and I really think the media should start using it in correct form.
[00:40:49.321 --> 00:40:55.185]  If you're an anti-Semite, well, that means you are against someone from the entire region, not necessarily an Israeli.
[00:40:55.265 --> 00:40:55.445]  Yeah.
[00:40:55.545 --> 00:40:56.706]  Hey, listen, I appreciate the call.
[00:40:56.746 --> 00:40:58.247]  I've got to get on to some other callers.
[00:40:58.447 --> 00:41:00.889]  I don't believe any one group runs the New World Order.
[00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:02.831]  I don't think black people run it.
[00:41:02.951 --> 00:41:04.832]  I don't think black people are the chosen people.
[00:41:05.232 --> 00:41:09.695]  Like Khalid Mohammed says, I don't think white people are the chosen people.
[00:41:10.456 --> 00:41:12.677]  I think that we're all God's creatures.
[00:41:13.578 --> 00:41:16.300]  And I think we've got evil people running the New World Order.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.401]  What the globalists will do is
[00:41:19.242 --> 00:41:25.224]  Anytime you criticize world government or international finance, because there is some Jewish mafia involved in it.
[00:41:25.264 --> 00:41:31.086]  They don't dominate it, but many of the power positions are in the US and Europe.
[00:41:31.366 --> 00:41:34.047]  But the owners of it are the Dutch and British royalty and others.
[00:41:34.067 --> 00:41:46.191]  It's predominantly a WASP mafia, which is so powerful you never hear of it, as if, you know, a white Anglo-Saxon, a Protestant or Catholic mafia doesn't exist when it's the dominant mafia.
[00:41:47.668 --> 00:41:53.456]  But, you know, if you criticize Jewish Mafia, I mean, there's been a hundred books written by Jews about Jewish Mafia.
[00:41:53.936 --> 00:41:55.438]  I will criticize the Jewish Mafia.
[00:41:56.019 --> 00:41:58.883]  And then they'll try to say, well, that's anti-Semitic, and that's ridiculous.
[00:41:59.443 --> 00:42:02.668]  Paul in Delaware, and then Jim and George and Dave and others.
[00:42:03.008 --> 00:42:03.509]  Go ahead, Paul.
[00:42:04.133 --> 00:42:04.753]  Yeah, Alex.
[00:42:05.033 --> 00:42:06.493]  How are you doing today?
[00:42:06.634 --> 00:42:10.594]  I just wanted to apologize because you had said that I was accusing you of spinning.
[00:42:10.714 --> 00:42:12.515]  I just wanted to get the point out.
[00:42:12.615 --> 00:42:15.875]  Plus, my blood pressure was a little bit boiling because... Well, I don't remember.
[00:42:15.915 --> 00:42:16.736]  What are you talking about?
[00:42:16.896 --> 00:42:21.016]  I'm talking about... You were talking about the Matrix with David Icke yesterday?
[00:42:21.737 --> 00:42:21.977]  Yes.
[00:42:22.057 --> 00:42:26.518]  And you had said that I was trying to accuse you of... or I was spinning the story.
[00:42:26.838 --> 00:42:33.719]  I just want to say, no, I wasn't accusing you of spinning the story, but I was just... I guess my blood pressure was going a little bit up because you were sitting on the phone with
[00:42:34.184 --> 00:42:37.286]  David Icke, and I knew there were so many callers.
[00:42:37.707 --> 00:42:40.669]  You were talking about, you know, 9-11 and things with David Icke.
[00:42:41.009 --> 00:42:48.294]  The people that want to talk to this guy either are against his reptilian phase or they want to talk to him about it because they like it.
[00:42:48.735 --> 00:42:59.863]  But also, I wanted to clarify that I do not support Khalid Mohammed, but I do agree with his unbending, unyielding
[00:43:00.618 --> 00:43:05.263]  You know, position against, and by the way, he's passed away, so he's no longer living.
[00:43:05.683 --> 00:43:10.949]  But, um, I do agree with that, but as far as... Hold on a minute, Khalid Muhammad, the bald-headed black guy?
[00:43:11.169 --> 00:43:14.753]  Yeah, he died of an aneurysm, and, um... That's pretty suspicious.
[00:43:14.913 --> 00:43:15.313]  Yeah, it is.
[00:43:15.694 --> 00:43:17.596]  But, um, no, I just want to... He was a young man!
[00:43:18.237 --> 00:43:19.238]  Yeah, yeah, he was.
[00:43:19.738 --> 00:43:22.101]  And, um, very fit from what you could tell of him.
[00:43:22.141 --> 00:43:23.342]  He looked like he was in very good shape.
[00:43:23.823 --> 00:43:25.604]  But, um, I just want to clarify.
[00:43:25.664 --> 00:43:31.869]  No, I'm not a supporter of Khalid Mohammed, but I mean, it's just like, I could bring up... Well, I certainly hope not, because I got him on video saying this.
[00:43:32.129 --> 00:43:37.072]  Oh yeah, I've... We kill the women, we kill the children, we kill the little blue-eyed babies, that's right!
[00:43:37.213 --> 00:43:40.975]  And we kill the white women, because they are the military manufacturing center!
[00:43:41.175 --> 00:43:45.979]  And every nine months, they lay it out on their back, and fresh reinforcements roll out!
[00:43:46.859 --> 00:43:48.921]  Yeah, I, you know, I can... You ever seen him say that?
[00:43:49.361 --> 00:43:52.442]  Oh yeah, I have seen him say that, but I don't agree with that.
[00:43:52.702 --> 00:43:54.143]  I'm definitely against racism.
[00:43:54.263 --> 00:43:56.463]  I'm against people against Jews.
[00:43:56.864 --> 00:44:09.508]  I can tell you what, there's a lot of Jews that you do find out about because people have got into this mentality that it's all the Jews, so you do find a lot of information about the Jewish community, some portions of it that have been involved with the Illuminati and different
[00:44:09.795 --> 00:44:13.158]  Well, what is this obsession with Jews?
[00:44:13.178 --> 00:44:13.999]  I mean, I'm sick of it.
[00:44:14.359 --> 00:44:16.982]  It's a big diversion.
[00:44:17.302 --> 00:44:18.103]  You know what I think it is?
[00:44:18.263 --> 00:44:21.226]  I think that people, they've got to point the finger somewhere.
[00:44:22.206 --> 00:44:23.488]  Well, how about an evil?
[00:44:23.688 --> 00:44:25.249]  I've got to let you go, Paul.
[00:44:25.269 --> 00:44:25.870]  Good to hear from you.
[00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:27.271]  I've got to get to all these calls.
[00:44:27.952 --> 00:44:28.773]  Jim in Texas.
[00:44:28.833 --> 00:44:29.693]  Jim, go ahead.
[00:44:29.713 --> 00:44:30.254]  You're on the air.
[00:44:30.614 --> 00:44:31.255]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:44:31.595 --> 00:44:32.436]  I called last time.
[00:44:32.516 --> 00:44:33.277]  I was nervous.
[00:44:33.337 --> 00:44:33.997]  I just ran.
[00:44:34.818 --> 00:44:35.559]  That's okay, go ahead.
[00:44:35.759 --> 00:44:38.821]  Listen, first I want to thank you because you do the research that I'm not capable of.
[00:44:38.841 --> 00:44:41.743]  I don't have the time, and then I just go to prison planning for work.
[00:44:41.863 --> 00:44:42.223]  Pick it up.
[00:44:42.883 --> 00:44:47.226]  I have friends that, uh, they won't click on a prison plan if they're afraid the black helicopters will come by.
[00:44:47.326 --> 00:44:48.907]  That's right, unlimited amounts of them.
[00:44:49.208 --> 00:44:49.728]  Ridiculous.
[00:44:50.028 --> 00:44:51.169]  There's two things I'd like to tell you.
[00:44:51.189 --> 00:44:52.670]  You mentioned something, I listened last night.
[00:44:53.228 --> 00:44:58.932]  And you mentioned this man was dead, and you said, well, they faked their death, and then they had the technology to be young.
[00:44:58.992 --> 00:45:02.494]  Well, Coler said it was David Rockefeller, and it was not David Rockefeller that died.
[00:45:02.534 --> 00:45:04.536]  It was, uh... Oh, I got the article here.
[00:45:04.556 --> 00:45:05.356]  It was one of the other ones.
[00:45:05.536 --> 00:45:13.142]  Well, it's not about his death, but you mentioned sometimes they fake their death because they have the technology to look 30 again, and I've never seen anything on that.
[00:45:13.162 --> 00:45:14.923]  Do you have any... where to search that out?
[00:45:15.788 --> 00:45:26.974]  Yeah, that's actually a great area of my study that I haven't gotten into enough on the air, but what I'm saying is, sir, the technology we see today is 30 years old.
[00:45:29.015 --> 00:45:34.697]  And there are, what they do is, the medical system is designed where they quote, practice on us.
[00:45:35.738 --> 00:45:36.979]  That's why they call it a practice.
[00:45:38.869 --> 00:45:45.798]  And then the American Medical Association and Big Pharma doesn't authorize all the real developments and in cures and
[00:45:46.730 --> 00:46:16.267]  They only bring to the market the treatments, and then the elite have access to the real cures and things, and they admit that somebody can easily live to be comfortably 130, 140 now, but the elite have said in white papers and other publications that they don't want us to have access to that, they can't let 6 plus billion people have access to that, so they've got to dumb us down kind of into a stagnated technological level, while they develop under national security these pinnacles of secret technology
[00:46:16.847 --> 00:46:24.790]  And a parallel, highly advanced civilization that's been built under national security, literally right under us.
[00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:26.490]  Thank you.
[00:46:26.771 --> 00:46:27.351]  One other thing.
[00:46:28.551 --> 00:46:29.311]  I don't have a computer.
[00:46:29.331 --> 00:46:34.533]  I checked Prison Planet InfoWars at a friend's, but I think I'm going to go ahead and sign her up for Prison Planet TV.
[00:46:34.973 --> 00:46:36.794]  I've been saying when I get a computer, I'll do it.
[00:46:37.054 --> 00:46:38.475]  Listen, you mentioned one other thing.
[00:46:38.495 --> 00:46:42.096]  You said one time about a song that John Lennon came out with that you have the record.
[00:46:42.682 --> 00:46:45.443]  In about a week, I wish you'd put that on TV, where we could tape it.
[00:46:45.463 --> 00:46:53.127]  Yeah, somewhere in my office, in hundreds of CDs and thousands, literally thousands of videotapes, and my buddy Mason made a bunch of copies of it.
[00:46:53.147 --> 00:46:54.868]  I need to get him to give me one of the copies.
[00:46:54.908 --> 00:46:55.428]  Yeah, I think that's good.
[00:46:55.448 --> 00:47:08.735]  Somewhere in my office, it's a bunch of songs he had, right before he died, about how he'd been fooled, how it was wrong, how it was all controlled, how the Illuminati devil worshippers ran things, and he actually says that in the lyrics.
[00:47:09.095 --> 00:47:11.516]  Yeah, he had a tremendous following, and I'm sure they were scared of it.
[00:47:11.897 --> 00:47:19.179]  And it'd be nice if you could maybe put those out and if you'd get them on the TV where we could copy them and print them on TV and maybe get out to the people.
[00:47:19.359 --> 00:47:20.939]  He had an influence over a lot of people.
[00:47:21.879 --> 00:47:23.780]  Alright sir, well I appreciate the call.
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:29.061]  You know, we don't really put other people's audio and video on the site.
[00:47:29.221 --> 00:47:31.802]  It's our video or people who've authorized us to so I'm not going to...
[00:47:32.438 --> 00:47:38.021]  Get into the business of putting other people's music up on the website, but I should dig that out and tell folks the name of it.
[00:47:38.741 --> 00:47:41.742]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in Colorado.
[00:47:41.782 --> 00:47:42.683]  George, go ahead.
[00:47:43.403 --> 00:47:44.824]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[00:47:45.004 --> 00:47:45.244]  Good.
[00:47:45.604 --> 00:47:47.545]  I really appreciate the job that you're doing.
[00:47:47.565 --> 00:47:48.346]  It's awesome.
[00:47:49.006 --> 00:47:52.948]  Now what I'm going to talk about here is about 9-11, but not the 9-11 2000, but the 9-11 in 1973 in Chile.
[00:47:52.988 --> 00:47:53.708]  Yeah, with Pinochet?
[00:48:02.304 --> 00:48:02.704]  Yeah.
[00:48:03.365 --> 00:48:04.926]  It was supported by CIA.
[00:48:05.566 --> 00:48:09.528]  There was no oil in Chile, but instead we have a huge Pacific coast.
[00:48:10.369 --> 00:48:14.091]  We were full of Cubans, full of Russians at that time.
[00:48:14.771 --> 00:48:20.535]  I guess the government was pretty scared of Chile becoming a second Cuba.
[00:48:22.075 --> 00:48:22.876]  So that's what we have.
[00:48:23.896 --> 00:48:25.117]  We have a curve.
[00:48:26.318 --> 00:48:28.179]  We went through something really hard.
[00:48:29.141 --> 00:48:33.724]  Believe me, we Chileans, we do know about what a political state is.
[00:48:34.665 --> 00:48:37.527]  We know about torture, we know about lying.
[00:48:38.476 --> 00:48:43.620]  Well, that's the point.
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.481]  If you want to fight communists, fine.
[00:48:45.501 --> 00:48:53.908]  But you don't put on black uniforms, torture people like the communists, act just like them in the name of fighting them.
[00:48:54.408 --> 00:48:57.511]  And it's this attitude of, well, we've got to be as evil as they are to win.
[00:48:57.531 --> 00:48:59.012]  Then that comes home.
[00:48:59.112 --> 00:49:01.154]  Then you get a group of sociopaths.
[00:49:01.734 --> 00:49:03.896]  You can't fight the darkness with the darkness.
[00:49:04.556 --> 00:49:07.038]  And now this evil has come home to roost here in America.
[00:49:08.703 --> 00:49:13.706]  And you know, that's why it scares me when you talk about this police state.
[00:49:14.586 --> 00:49:15.707]  I've been there.
[00:49:15.727 --> 00:49:17.828]  I've really been there.
[00:49:17.928 --> 00:49:23.171]  So you guys better think about it because that's for real.
[00:49:23.791 --> 00:49:24.572]  This is not a joke.
[00:49:25.192 --> 00:49:25.812]  This is real.
[00:49:27.113 --> 00:49:28.274]  So you were in Chile?
[00:49:28.334 --> 00:49:29.594]  You were in Chile during this?
[00:49:29.814 --> 00:49:30.955]  At that time, yeah.
[00:49:31.015 --> 00:49:33.776]  I'm 45 years old, so I remember pretty good what happened.
[00:49:34.717 --> 00:49:36.598]  How old were you at the time?
[00:49:36.618 --> 00:49:37.458]  I was 14 years old.
[00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:40.131]  And what was it like?
[00:49:40.191 --> 00:49:44.273]  And I remember, actually, everybody at that time, they weren't touching that.
[00:49:44.674 --> 00:49:48.616]  Everybody wanted the idea to go out of the power, because it was a real mess.
[00:49:48.676 --> 00:49:55.101]  I mean, we were full of foreign people that had nothing to do with the country, that did not rule, and stuff like that.
[00:49:55.721 --> 00:49:59.964]  But man, what came after that was awful.
[00:50:00.004 --> 00:50:04.727]  I mean, we're talking about 17 years of police aid.
[00:50:05.808 --> 00:50:06.688]  What was it like?
[00:50:07.168 --> 00:50:07.869]  What was it like?
[00:50:09.133 --> 00:50:12.655]  Well, you have no freedom of speech.
[00:50:12.775 --> 00:50:14.095]  People were missing.
[00:50:14.255 --> 00:50:16.436]  People are missing until today.
[00:50:16.456 --> 00:50:19.237]  There's a lot of people that you don't know where they are.
[00:50:19.498 --> 00:50:23.379]  You don't know whether they are dead or whether they are whatever.
[00:50:23.399 --> 00:50:25.180]  Well, they're gone for 30 years.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.341]  They're in a shallow grave.
[00:50:26.441 --> 00:50:28.321]  Yeah, they're talking about 30 years ago.
[00:50:28.341 --> 00:50:34.304]  So, that calls me up from the Illuminati, the 9-11, because it was from 9-11.
[00:50:34.484 --> 00:50:36.705]  That's when they took over, yeah.
[00:50:36.745 --> 00:50:38.406]  So, that number is pretty callous, huh?
[00:50:39.266 --> 00:50:41.347]  You didn't dial 9-11, you want to call the police.
[00:50:41.367 --> 00:50:43.267]  That's right.
[00:50:43.287 --> 00:50:43.907]  We have 2000, 9-11.
[00:50:43.947 --> 00:50:44.908]  We have 1973, 9-11 in Cuba.
[00:50:44.928 --> 00:50:48.048]  Come on, what's going on here?
[00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:49.109]  And Madrid was 3-11.
[00:50:49.689 --> 00:50:50.349]  Thanks for the call.
[00:50:50.429 --> 00:50:51.129]  Interesting points.
[00:50:51.489 --> 00:50:52.710]  People disappearing!
[00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:55.130]  Well, that's what the Supreme Court says they can do.
[00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:56.991]  I mean, that's what America's about.
[00:50:57.071 --> 00:50:58.251]  Secretly arresting people.
[00:50:58.711 --> 00:50:59.412]  Disappearing.
[00:50:59.472 --> 00:50:59.932]  Torture.
[00:50:59.952 --> 00:51:00.352]  It's freedom.
[00:51:01.593 --> 00:51:03.135]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.295 --> 00:51:06.379]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.519 --> 00:51:10.424]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.464 --> 00:51:14.709]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:15.049 --> 00:51:18.814]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.894 --> 00:51:20.736]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:21.337 --> 00:51:24.238]  Police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:51:24.298 --> 00:51:29.000]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:32.201]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.381 --> 00:51:35.262]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.743 --> 00:51:41.845]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.385 --> 00:51:46.187]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:52:01.036 --> 00:52:06.281]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:52:06.422 --> 00:52:14.510]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:52:14.770 --> 00:52:21.817]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:52:22.757 --> 00:52:29.261]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:52:29.441 --> 00:52:34.544]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:52:34.644 --> 00:52:43.510]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:47.092]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[00:54:20.237 --> 00:54:24.040]  Coming up in about 20 minutes at the next hour, we've got Paul Watson for the balance of the broadcast.

[00:54:28.985 --> 00:54:30.506]  And we'll get into all this other news.
[00:54:30.566 --> 00:54:37.172]  We're going to go to David and Perry and Mike and Carson and others as well here in just a moment.
[00:54:37.793 --> 00:54:41.116]  And before I do that, I'm a documentary filmmaker, my friends.
[00:54:41.156 --> 00:54:42.237]  I've made 10 films.
[00:54:43.183 --> 00:54:43.903]  I've written a book.
[00:54:44.043 --> 00:54:45.124]  I've published a book.
[00:54:45.384 --> 00:54:52.388]  I carry a bunch of other great videos and books and t-shirts and InfoWars.com bumper stickers.

[00:55:12.276 --> 00:55:14.058]  Both videos are excellent, over two hours.
[00:55:15.219 --> 00:55:16.380]  Amazing films you need to have.
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:26.071]  I also carry Eric Huffman's video, 9-11 Painful Deceptions, his book, 9-11 Painful Questions, book and video.

[00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:39.651]  This is my life's work.
[00:56:39.711 --> 00:56:45.313]  I've put my life on the line to do it, and I think it's worth it, and I hope you'll get the videos, and so the truth can be known.
[00:56:46.114 --> 00:56:48.195]  Alright, let's talk to David in Illinois.
[00:56:48.235 --> 00:56:49.055]  You're on the air, sir.
[00:56:51.421 --> 00:56:59.266]  Alex, you talk about how you could tell by the media push that Osama Bin Laden was going to do something like 9-11, right?
[00:56:59.286 --> 00:57:00.587]  Yes.
[00:57:02.048 --> 00:57:13.896]  The media push I see for the upcoming election, they had a story Saturday in the Los Angeles Times about two new discs missing from Los Alamos Lab.
[00:57:14.477 --> 00:57:20.921]  And it says, this time officials call the loss very serious, and it's the third such incident in eight months.
[00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:26.572]  And there's been dozens of instances in the history of the SIB.
[00:57:26.993 --> 00:57:32.116]  It's meant to proliferate weapons to create a global crisis so they can offer a world government as the solution.
[00:57:32.817 --> 00:57:42.484]  Well, the way I see it is, why would they come out and give us news reports about classified data except to scare people?
[00:57:43.565 --> 00:57:45.126]  It seems to me it's kind of like
[00:57:45.871 --> 00:57:49.335]  The same media push I saw with Osama Bin Laden back then.
[00:57:49.355 --> 00:57:50.697]  Yeah, right before 9-11.
[00:57:50.737 --> 00:57:51.538]  This is Bin Laden.
[00:57:51.578 --> 00:57:52.459]  He's about to get you.
[00:57:52.499 --> 00:57:54.241]  Give up your rights when he attacks.
[00:57:54.782 --> 00:57:56.724]  The buildings will be in trouble real soon.
[00:57:57.345 --> 00:57:58.866]  We're planning something big, Bush said.
[00:57:58.906 --> 00:58:00.248]  You'll see what our policy will be.
[00:58:00.268 --> 00:58:00.629]  Ha ha ha.
[00:58:01.721 --> 00:58:13.088]  And then magically, yeah, that's how, I mean, all those factors, hundreds of factors, I came on air and said, Bin Laden will take the blame, they're going to attack probably the World Trade Center here in the next few months, call the White House, tell them don't do it.
[00:58:13.489 --> 00:58:15.710]  I mean, I never do stuff like that, but I went on air and said that.
[00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:21.213]  And I agree, the White House is saying we will be attacked, capital will be destroyed, we may suspend the election.
[00:58:21.694 --> 00:58:30.039]  I'm not sure they're going to do it this time, but they're certainly got that on the front burner, they've got that program ready to launch that operation if they see fit.
[00:58:31.354 --> 00:58:32.054]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:58:32.074 --> 00:58:34.915]  I said I'd answer the question of, why haven't they done that?
[00:58:35.015 --> 00:58:39.075]  Why haven't... Because if they got Kerry, it's a shoo-in, why do this?
[00:58:39.436 --> 00:58:44.176]  Because it's about acclimating us for martial law, just getting us used to it regardless of who's in office.
[00:58:44.516 --> 00:58:45.217]  Stay there, David.
[00:58:45.277 --> 00:58:46.697]  It's a very important point you brought up.
[00:58:46.717 --> 00:58:47.537]  We'll talk more about it.
[00:58:48.057 --> 00:58:49.237]  Then we'll get our guest on.
[00:58:49.257 --> 00:58:49.677]  Stay with us.
[00:58:49.717 --> 00:58:50.658]  Second hour straight ahead.
[00:58:51.818 --> 00:58:52.118]  Hello.
[00:58:57.559 --> 00:58:58.159]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.863 --> 00:58:59.944]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.644 --> 00:59:01.804]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.405 --> 00:59:03.265]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.965 --> 00:59:04.846]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.866 --> 00:59:09.207]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.728 --> 00:59:13.849]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:22.073 --> 00:59:26.215]  Alright, my friends, we are now into hour number two.
[00:59:27.831 --> 00:59:30.472]  Boy, if your station didn't carry the first hour, you really missed it.
[00:59:30.492 --> 00:59:32.573]  We covered a ton of news, a lot of great calls.
[00:59:33.233 --> 00:59:37.714]  Coming up in about 6-7 minutes, we're going to have an update on the Terri Schiavo Schindler case.
[00:59:37.995 --> 00:59:41.056]  The lady who's not in a coma, who the government's been trying to kill for years.
[00:59:41.836 --> 00:59:45.717]  A lot of evidence of foul play involved in how she got paralyzed to begin with.
[00:59:45.737 --> 00:59:49.218]  And this is a very serious issue, so a quick update on that.
[00:59:49.258 --> 00:59:56.381]  Then Paul Joseph Watson will join us from PrisonPlanet.com with a whole host of global and national issues.
[00:59:58.081 --> 01:00:01.928]  As we fight the New World Order, the controlled left and the controlled right.
[01:00:01.968 --> 01:00:03.490]  Of course, wide open phones as well.
[01:00:05.658 --> 01:00:07.639]  The Red Cross fears U.S.
[01:00:07.799 --> 01:00:12.241]  is hiding detainees, the AP reports, families, children, you name it.
[01:00:12.281 --> 01:00:18.865]  Well, the government admitted two years ago, in major publications, they take people to third-party countries for torture, so we'll get into that.
[01:00:19.325 --> 01:00:23.007]  Also, Homeland Security admits that they do have plans to suspend the election.
[01:00:23.607 --> 01:00:25.148]  And you say, well, then why does it matter?
[01:00:25.168 --> 01:00:32.852]  I mean, if Bush and Kerry are cousins and they're both skull and bones and they both, in reality, have the same policies, just different rhetoric,
[01:00:33.522 --> 01:00:35.563]  You know, different talk, but the same actions.
[01:00:35.864 --> 01:00:36.524]  Why does it matter?
[01:00:36.544 --> 01:00:38.766]  Because they want to get us used to martial law.
[01:00:39.186 --> 01:00:40.487]  Used to not having elections.
[01:00:41.087 --> 01:00:42.969]  You know, under this whole color-coded system.
[01:00:43.369 --> 01:00:44.510]  That's what all this is about.
[01:00:44.650 --> 01:00:47.732]  Introducing martial law and civil emergency as freedom.
[01:00:48.172 --> 01:00:48.933]  It's like Iraq.
[01:00:48.973 --> 01:00:54.216]  Our government appoints the government, appoints the Ba'ath Party, with the new coalition of the Communists.
[01:00:54.416 --> 01:00:56.818]  The Communists and the Ba'athists, who our government's put in power.
[01:00:57.058 --> 01:01:02.442]  They appoint a new dictator, and he says, we're going to have martial law, and our liberal media
[01:01:02.802 --> 01:01:04.385]  Hails that as freedom!
[01:01:05.748 --> 01:01:07.892]  Along with the neocon, ultra-liberal media.
[01:01:08.292 --> 01:01:11.258]  The so-called conservative talk shows are the most liberal out there.
[01:01:13.467 --> 01:01:23.471]  David in Illinois was coming to the fore and saying, you know, he sees that same preparation for fear and terrorism, it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen, that we saw before 9-11.
[01:01:24.352 --> 01:01:26.293]  And unfortunately, I agree with him.
[01:01:26.813 --> 01:01:38.758]  But by speaking out and talking about who stands to gain from terrorism, who really gets power from it, who was behind it in 9-11, the military-industrial complex, by speaking out, we can back these people off.
[01:01:39.078 --> 01:01:40.319]  David, to finish up what you were saying.
[01:01:40.879 --> 01:01:42.100]  Oh yeah, I would totally agree with that.
[01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:51.335]  If you know a bank is going to be robbed and you go outside the bank and you're yelling, hey the bank's going to be robbed, they're not going to go rob the bank.
[01:01:52.856 --> 01:02:04.504]  Well what they'll do is they won't carry out the terror attack they were planning, or they won't bring out the bin Laden who died of kidney failure two and a half years ago, we got that from the White House, and now it's mainstream news, they might roll him out.
[01:02:04.544 --> 01:02:06.325]  They'll move off and do something else, go ahead.
[01:02:06.805 --> 01:02:10.648]  Yeah, the only other thing I have is another article I saw today
[01:02:11.512 --> 01:02:19.620]  They kind of buried it in there, how the United Nations is helping Afghanistan organize their October 7th presidential election.
[01:02:20.721 --> 01:02:22.182]  It's under an article about U.S.
[01:02:22.222 --> 01:02:29.509]  to protect Afghan elections, but you know, they just buried it in a sentence that the United Nations is organizing the elections.
[01:02:30.409 --> 01:02:37.636]  And again, they call it democracy over there when our government appointed Mohammed Karzai, who was the former VP at Unicole.
[01:02:38.695 --> 01:02:42.480]  Their VP over Central Asian Affairs.
[01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:44.262]  Wasn't just a consultant, folks.
[01:02:44.782 --> 01:02:49.548]  He actually sat in a VP position, which they got about 15 of those, but I forget a whole bunch of them.
[01:02:50.028 --> 01:02:52.031]  But, I mean, yeah, it's so obvious.
[01:02:53.092 --> 01:02:57.437]  But hey, here in our own country, I mean, these elections with these electronic voting machines are a joke.
[01:02:58.513 --> 01:03:03.255]  Yeah, the electronic voting machines are one of the worst things I think I've ever seen in this country.
[01:03:03.295 --> 01:03:07.517]  Well, how dare you ask for a paper trail, or auditability, or for transparency?
[01:03:08.057 --> 01:03:15.321]  I mean, we send our monitors to third world countries to watch them, and people get to watch the vote counting there, but not in America!
[01:03:15.341 --> 01:03:18.342]  Are you working with Al-Qaeda or something?
[01:03:19.703 --> 01:03:25.005]  Well, that's one reason why I think they would bring in Kerry, is to sell the deep old machines.
[01:03:25.695 --> 01:03:26.535]  Diebold or whatever.
[01:03:26.955 --> 01:03:28.036]  Oh, see, we can trust him.
[01:03:28.056 --> 01:03:29.276]  He put the Democrats in.
[01:03:29.696 --> 01:03:35.398]  Yeah, because the Democrats are the ones making the most stink about it, so you bring in Kerry and they're like, oh, I guess those machines are okay.
[01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:36.819]  I guess those are pretty darn good.
[01:03:37.059 --> 01:03:38.599]  Yeah, but thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:03:38.699 --> 01:03:39.719]  Hey, good to hear from you.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:44.121]  We'll be back with a guest, more ear calls, and a ton of vital news and information.

[01:03:55.501 --> 01:04:00.986]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:04:01.406 --> 01:04:05.649]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:04:05.890 --> 01:04:12.915]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:04:13.296 --> 01:04:19.401]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:04:19.541 --> 01:04:20.762]  There are no side effects.
[01:04:21.102 --> 01:04:24.044]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:04:24.204 --> 01:04:26.225]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:04:26.525 --> 01:04:33.769]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:37.451]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:04:53.220 --> 01:05:01.127]  Skyrocketing oil prices, the economy on the brink, the plunging dollar, terrorism, the government spending $1.80 for every dollar it collects.
[01:05:01.448 --> 01:05:06.732]  Never in the history of our country have we faced so many threats to our freedoms, rights, and individual security.
[01:05:06.913 --> 01:05:09.515]  How long can we continue without a fracture occurring?
[01:05:09.635 --> 01:05:14.680]  With the events that recently rocked the elections in Spain, what will happen as we get closer to our own election?
[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:17.742]  Now is the time to begin preparing for such threats.
[01:05:18.022 --> 01:05:22.765]  Ready Reserve Foods has been helping businesses, government, and individuals for over 32 years.

[01:05:46.858 --> 01:05:51.300]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:56.842]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:57.022 --> 01:06:01.364]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:04.121 --> 01:06:06.002]  This disaster is a new world order.
[01:06:06.082 --> 01:06:08.863]  A new world order can emerge.
[01:06:09.123 --> 01:06:13.364]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:13.425 --> 01:06:20.347]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:20.487 --> 01:06:22.508]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:22.728 --> 01:06:33.190]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:38.851]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:06:43.812 --> 01:06:45.532]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:06:52.739 --> 01:06:57.782]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.142 --> 01:07:00.464]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:00.484 --> 01:07:11.831]  If you're not willing to die for something, folks, you're not really alive.
[01:07:11.851 --> 01:07:15.934]  You're not willing to die for your children's freedom and liberty.
[01:07:15.954 --> 01:07:17.715]  You're not willing to sacrifice.
[01:07:19.207 --> 01:07:22.110]  Then you're not even a human being, you're an animal, folks.
[01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:25.592]  I mean, even animals, I shouldn't be mean to them, will defend their family.
[01:07:26.513 --> 01:07:34.260]  And the globalists, this global corporate crime syndicate control the left and the right, and they're bringing in massive dehumanization.
[01:07:35.421 --> 01:07:39.184]  We're about to cover that, then we'll get to your calls, and we've got Paul Watson joining us.
[01:07:39.284 --> 01:07:40.145]  Just an announcement.
[01:07:40.165 --> 01:07:46.350]  A few months ago, we got a great affiliate up in Youngstown,
[01:07:48.018 --> 01:07:53.003]  And now another affiliate, this time in Ohio, in Canton, Ohio.
[01:07:53.023 --> 01:08:02.373]  WCER 900 AM carries three hours of the show at night, of the broadcast.
[01:08:02.413 --> 01:08:06.157]  So, a lot of new, great affiliates, powerful stations.
[01:08:07.009 --> 01:08:21.917]  Because a lot of program directors and a lot of station owners have heard me on the air for years, have heard me lay out the facts, and have seen it all come true, and we're gaining mass acceptance, folks, with exposing the New World Order.
[01:08:22.478 --> 01:08:30.102]  So we want to thank all the new affiliates that we've been getting on a weekly basis around the country, and all the glory goes to God.
[01:08:32.411 --> 01:08:41.275]  Also, again, I just have to mention this, that the number one song on the radio right now, a hip-hop song, asks why Bush knocked down the towers.
[01:08:42.636 --> 01:08:45.177]  And Clear Channel and others are trying to censor that.
[01:08:45.757 --> 01:08:48.138]  And you have to ask yourself, why?
[01:08:48.158 --> 01:08:51.780]  And why is the number one song saying this?
[01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:53.521]  In the country, folks!
[01:08:53.541 --> 01:08:56.322]  Because hip-hop's number one, and it's the number one hip-hop song.
[01:08:58.274 --> 01:09:00.417]  Again, you can say the world's flat all day.
[01:09:00.477 --> 01:09:03.360]  We say it's round, and we're going to convince the planet of that.
[01:09:03.821 --> 01:09:08.487]  And to see more and more pop culture venues is becoming common knowledge.
[01:09:09.448 --> 01:09:11.610]  Again, I've done over 1,600 radio interviews.
[01:09:11.671 --> 01:09:12.672]  I haven't counted them up lately.
[01:09:12.692 --> 01:09:13.733]  A few months ago it was 1,600.
[01:09:14.434 --> 01:09:15.695]  It's probably getting close to 1,650 here.
[01:09:18.541 --> 01:09:26.785]  I've done all these thousands of interviews, and maybe one caller out of thirty disagrees with me on liberal shows, conservative shows, as I lay out how the globalists carried out 9-11.
[01:09:26.945 --> 01:09:28.065]  Very, very serious.
[01:09:28.145 --> 01:09:46.813]  Alright, the issue at hand right now, we'll have her with us for a few segments here, and we're honored to have her, is the president of Not Dead Yet, Diane Coleman, and they're a national group exposing some of the evils of the modern eugenics movement that we call bioethics.
[01:09:48.001 --> 01:09:49.543]  Evil always changes its name.
[01:09:50.744 --> 01:09:58.351]  And we've had the family on, we've had the lawyers on, we've probably done 15 shows on this, but not in months, because we've stalled them killing her for now.
[01:09:58.371 --> 01:10:10.562]  17 national disability groups file in Bush vs. Schiavo, and leading this coalition is Diane Coleman, with President of Not Dead Yet.
[01:10:11.161 --> 01:10:13.182]  And we have a press release on InfoWars.com.
[01:10:13.202 --> 01:10:18.524]  So we've had Terri Schiavo's, Chandler's parents on, their lawyers, great folks.
[01:10:19.225 --> 01:10:25.988]  And so joining us is Diane Coleman, the head of Not Dead Yet, and it's good to have you on with us, Diane.
[01:10:26.648 --> 01:10:27.268]  Thanks, Mr. Jones.
[01:10:27.309 --> 01:10:28.389]  It's nice to be here.
[01:10:29.029 --> 01:10:29.429]  You bet.
[01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:34.632]  Just for those that don't know, most of the listeners do, probably a third of them don't, just in a nutshell,
[01:10:36.363 --> 01:10:38.044]  Who is Terri Schiavo Schindler?
[01:10:38.124 --> 01:10:39.204]  Why is the case important?
[01:10:39.285 --> 01:10:41.946]  You know, this 10 plus year nightmare saga.
[01:10:42.246 --> 01:10:44.448]  And then tell us about this new coalition.
[01:10:45.729 --> 01:10:58.317]  Well, Terri Schiavo is a woman with very significant brain injury, significant cognitive disabilities, who is in a facility in Florida.
[01:10:58.517 --> 01:11:03.380]  And there's a dispute between her family members about whether
[01:11:04.366 --> 01:11:11.551]  She should continue to have food and water which is at this point provided by two.
[01:11:12.052 --> 01:11:32.166]  That technically renders the food and water medical treatment and her husband wants to remove her food and water and her parents say that that's not what she would have wanted and the point when you have a substitute decision maker that's the thing is they get to decide because she didn't leave a living will
[01:11:32.665 --> 01:11:39.170]  Or any document, and she did not choose who her decision maker would be if she became incapacitated.
[01:11:39.190 --> 01:11:42.432]  Well, let me just say, I want to be kept alive.
[01:11:42.452 --> 01:11:44.453]  I want to be kept alive at all costs.
[01:11:45.894 --> 01:11:46.495]  Now we know.
[01:11:46.515 --> 01:11:48.376]  I guess you've told a lot of people that way.
[01:11:48.396 --> 01:11:48.456]  Yes.
[01:11:49.297 --> 01:11:50.578]  In her case, she didn't.
[01:11:51.038 --> 01:11:56.142]  There's quite a hotly disputed but small set of evidence about it.
[01:11:56.282 --> 01:12:02.226]  And what the disability community is saying, and this is the 17 organizations that include
[01:12:02.722 --> 01:12:09.187]  Organizations like the Arc of the United States, which used to be known as the Association for Retarded Citizens.
[01:12:09.567 --> 01:12:12.529]  It includes the National Spinal Cord Injury Association.
[01:12:12.549 --> 01:12:23.137]  There are many prominent groups, National Council on Independent Living, Self Advocates Becoming Empowered, which is a group of people with primarily developmental disabilities.
[01:12:24.037 --> 01:12:30.642]  And what we're concerned about is that this decision could have an effect on anyone who is currently
[01:12:31.187 --> 01:12:43.650]  In guardianship, or might ever be in guardianship, either due to having a cognitive disability they're born with, one they acquire through a brain injury, or one they acquire through a stroke or dementia, Alzheimer's.
[01:12:44.191 --> 01:12:53.153]  There's a lot of people that could be affected by the standards that are applied to a substitute decision maker.
[01:12:53.433 --> 01:12:58.855]  And it's not just right-to-life groups that I commend and I agree with that are fighting this.
[01:12:58.895 --> 01:13:00.035]  It's also a lot of
[01:13:01.394 --> 01:13:07.817]  Middle of the road groups, and we've posted the video of her following the balloon, laughing at her parents.
[01:13:08.317 --> 01:13:14.220]  We've interviewed the doctors who, you know, five, six years ago, before they stopped them, were able to feed her through her mouth.
[01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:18.562]  There's a lot of suspicious circumstances of, you know, how all this happened.
[01:13:18.582 --> 01:13:21.103]  I know that's all separate, but there's a lot to this.
[01:13:21.203 --> 01:13:23.224]  And are you familiar with people like David Wendland?
[01:13:24.190 --> 01:13:25.911]  We've interviewed Wall Street Journal writers and others.
[01:13:26.311 --> 01:13:35.935]  There are actually people begging for food and water that signed away their rights in the past, and now they say, no, no, no, that's medical treatment, who are being dehydrated to death.
[01:13:36.375 --> 01:13:37.435]  Can you comment to that?
[01:13:38.596 --> 01:13:53.822]  Well, as a matter of fact, we've heard anecdotally some of those same kinds of situations happening with food and water being a key issue, and the idea that a person, no matter what their cognitive abilities are, can't say, I want food and water.
[01:13:55.344 --> 01:14:06.253]  It's just so disturbing and shocking and it shows how far things have gone in terms of the bioethics community.
[01:14:07.073 --> 01:14:23.987]  I think the mainstream bioethics community is really carrying out what we would call in the disability movement the philosophies of Peter Singer, professor at Princeton, who believed that people with extreme or significant cognitive disabilities
[01:14:24.654 --> 01:14:29.338]  are not persons under the law and that our constitutional rights could be taken away.
[01:14:29.378 --> 01:14:30.378]  Well, I've got his quotes.
[01:14:30.459 --> 01:14:30.959]  I've read them.
[01:14:30.999 --> 01:14:40.886]  He told the Governor's Conference three years ago that babies are mackerel, old people are... He had a bunch of horrible terms.
[01:14:40.926 --> 01:14:45.810]  It was subhuman, cattle, it was the same as a cow.
[01:14:46.971 --> 01:14:50.053]  He had horrible terms for mentally retarded people.
[01:14:50.073 --> 01:14:52.215]  I mean, just amazing stuff.
[01:14:53.061 --> 01:15:05.195]  Well, and the thing about the personhood issue, because that's where they're trying to really take away the rights of people with significant cognitive disabilities, and we feel that all
[01:15:05.874 --> 01:15:12.619]  Human beings should have equal rights under the Constitution, both of the United States and all of the individual states.
[01:15:12.639 --> 01:15:28.409]  Well, I agree, but Diane Coleman, president of Not Dead Yet, we'll give your website out in a second, the average person you talk to laughs at you if you tell them that, say, Wesley Smith of the Wall Street Journal has listed hundreds of people who are begging for food and water they've killed.
[01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:33.893]  I think there's a disconnect with the general public not realizing how bad it's gotten.
[01:15:34.993 --> 01:15:48.201]  I think you're right, because the fact is that if the family members of Terri Schiavo did not disagree, then Terri Schiavo would already have been starved and dehydrated to death, and in fact... They've already tried it three times!
[01:15:48.662 --> 01:16:00.109]  Right, and in fact, this is happening every day already, in one place or another in the country, and perhaps every state every day.
[01:16:00.129 --> 01:16:03.731]  I mean, there is not a method yet
[01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:20.064]  The data is not being collected to show it because when a person's death certificate is filled out after this happens to them, the cause of death is going to be listed as whatever their condition was rather than the fact that they were starved and dehydrated to death.
[01:16:20.384 --> 01:16:29.172]  So the system is setting it up so that those of us who are concerned about how much this is happening can't get the information to even show that there's a problem.
[01:16:31.603 --> 01:16:38.246]  Now, if somebody was doing this to a suspected Al-Qaeda member, you would hear rightful howls of indignation.
[01:16:38.846 --> 01:16:43.028]  But it's done to innocent men and women and children.
[01:16:44.248 --> 01:16:49.490]  And the average person, again, as you said so eloquently, isn't even aware this is going on.
[01:16:50.151 --> 01:16:51.831]  And people say, how did this happen in Germany?
[01:16:51.851 --> 01:16:53.852]  Because this is how it all started in Germany, folks.
[01:16:54.213 --> 01:16:57.094]  The, you know, the sick, the infirm, they call them idiots, whatever.
[01:16:57.614 --> 01:17:06.378]  This is how it started in the early 30s as soon as the Fuhrer got in using some American models, which they even used as a Nuremberg defense successfully in some cases.
[01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:09.441]  You know, people say, well, the Germans had to know.
[01:17:09.741 --> 01:17:11.901]  No, they didn't know because the media didn't tell them.
[01:17:11.921 --> 01:17:12.321]  Go ahead.
[01:17:12.701 --> 01:17:18.182]  Well, this is what is happening here is an abuse of the right to refuse treatment.
[01:17:18.562 --> 01:17:30.625]  That right is a constitutional right of the individual and people have the right to refuse treatment in the here and now themselves or even by a living will or other, you know, clear and convincing evidence of what they really wanted.
[01:17:31.645 --> 01:17:36.646]  But that's not what we're talking about in the Terry Schiavo case and so many of these other cases.
[01:17:37.062 --> 01:17:50.916]  Where the individual is not able to express their wishes and they depend on some other person, a family member or even in many cases, I'm scared to say, the public guardian to make these decisions.
[01:17:51.597 --> 01:17:56.882]  And these decisions are being made without adequate evidence of what the person would want.
[01:17:57.244 --> 01:17:57.524]  I think so.
[01:18:12.606 --> 01:18:17.009]  sensitive to the fact that the health care system and society at large.
[01:18:17.050 --> 01:18:18.391]  Yeah, it doesn't want to pay for this.
[01:18:18.811 --> 01:18:20.312]  Right, they don't want to pay.
[01:18:20.572 --> 01:18:27.417]  What we'll do to the least of us will end up happening to all of us, and a society is judged in history by how it treats the weakest members.
[01:18:28.118 --> 01:18:33.682]  And I would also add, folks, that there is no more painful form of death than dehydration.
[01:18:33.702 --> 01:18:35.083]  We've had medical doctors on.
[01:18:35.103 --> 01:18:38.466]  Let's talk about that when we get back in the final segment.
[01:18:39.351 --> 01:18:41.493]  With the president of Not Dead Yet, Diane Coleman.
[01:18:41.513 --> 01:18:43.174]  We'll give out our website as well when we get back.
[01:18:43.395 --> 01:18:44.696]  Then your calls and a bunch of other news.
[01:18:44.716 --> 01:18:45.076]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.326 --> 01:19:01.952]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:19:02.172 --> 01:19:13.400]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:16.301]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:19:16.642 --> 01:19:23.105]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:19:23.265 --> 01:19:25.146]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:19:25.346 --> 01:19:31.369]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:19:31.609 --> 01:19:37.272]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[01:19:53.605 --> 01:19:55.948]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:19:56.208 --> 01:20:00.051]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:20:00.372 --> 01:20:01.192]  Read the labels.
[01:20:01.613 --> 01:20:05.757]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:20:05.977 --> 01:20:10.161]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:20:10.521 --> 01:20:15.406]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:20:15.786 --> 01:20:19.368]  Now, just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.

[01:20:52.876 --> 01:20:59.083]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:20:59.543 --> 01:21:07.331]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:21:07.672 --> 01:21:15.520]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:20.601]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:21:20.921 --> 01:21:25.622]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:21:26.142 --> 01:21:30.003]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:21:30.503 --> 01:21:31.503]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:31.583 --> 01:21:35.664]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[01:21:40.985 --> 01:21:43.506]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:05.823]  Think about a society every day that we know of killing people who are conscious.
[01:23:08.686 --> 01:23:11.308]  The Eugenics Forge, known as Bioethics Forge.
[01:23:11.868 --> 01:23:16.011]  Controlled, financed, underwritten by the HMOs.
[01:23:17.573 --> 01:23:19.794]  A lot of greedy yuppies, I hear them on talk radio.
[01:23:19.834 --> 01:23:21.095]  Yeah, get rid of these old people.
[01:23:21.135 --> 01:23:21.876]  You fools!
[01:23:21.956 --> 01:23:23.557]  You could have a stroke today!
[01:23:23.577 --> 01:23:23.617]  At 25!
[01:23:24.058 --> 01:23:25.599]  A heart attack at 30!
[01:23:25.639 --> 01:23:25.899]  Cancer at 10!
[01:23:29.335 --> 01:23:32.381]  You could break your neck falling down stairs, God forbid!
[01:23:32.922 --> 01:23:33.984]  And then where are you gonna be?
[01:23:35.396 --> 01:23:37.618]  You can say, well, I wouldn't want to be alive if that happens.
[01:23:37.718 --> 01:23:38.158]  Oh, yeah.
[01:23:38.658 --> 01:23:42.681]  Imagine being helpless and knowing that there's medical developments that could fix you.
[01:23:42.942 --> 01:23:46.664]  You know, my uncle was in a coma for six weeks when he had a motorcycle accident.
[01:23:46.684 --> 01:23:51.368]  Now he's got two children, happily married, a ranch foreman, completely happy.
[01:23:51.408 --> 01:23:58.253]  And they didn't unplug him for those six weeks when he finally came out of that coma and had to relearn everything.
[01:23:58.293 --> 01:23:59.354]  He was totally retarded!
[01:24:03.152 --> 01:24:06.073]  And now he's, you know, 50-something years old with all these great children.
[01:24:06.133 --> 01:24:06.913]  My father's brother.
[01:24:08.053 --> 01:24:08.534]  Little brother.
[01:24:09.894 --> 01:24:17.896]  Now, we're almost out of time with our guests and I've been jumping all over just because I get so upset about this and I really appreciate Diane Coleman, President of Not Dead Yet.
[01:24:18.176 --> 01:24:27.299]  Diane, give us your website and how folks get involved and then what this means to have 17 national disability groups file a Bush vs. Schiavo case.
[01:24:27.879 --> 01:24:30.019]  Well, our website is www.notdeadyet.org
[01:24:32.347 --> 01:24:33.067]  All one word.
[01:24:33.268 --> 01:24:47.715]  And, you know, what's really been so disturbing to us is that, you know, this is the third time we've filed a large coalition-based amicus brief from the disability community, a disability brief, in this case.
[01:24:48.275 --> 01:24:49.756]  Not to mention some other cases.
[01:24:50.276 --> 01:24:59.661]  And it's so disturbing that the mainstream media, typically, be they right-wing or left-wing, have ignored
[01:25:00.354 --> 01:25:01.675]  Our involvement in the case.
[01:25:01.715 --> 01:25:06.559]  But the fact is, and you were just mentioning, if something happens to you, it could be you.
[01:25:06.659 --> 01:25:08.020]  And what we're saying is, guess what?
[01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:08.581]  It is us.
[01:25:09.201 --> 01:25:10.322]  This is about us.
[01:25:10.522 --> 01:25:14.986]  And we know that the system, we're like the canaries in the coal mine.
[01:25:15.266 --> 01:25:17.888]  We're right there on the front lines of the health care system.
[01:25:18.248 --> 01:25:19.910]  We know it doesn't respect us.
[01:25:19.950 --> 01:25:21.251]  We know we can't trust it.
[01:25:21.671 --> 01:25:29.317]  We know we need to have constitutional rights to deal with some of the violations that are already going on.
[01:25:30.101 --> 01:25:43.152]  And we're really demanding now that our concerns about these cases be given due attention and respect by the courts.
[01:25:43.652 --> 01:25:49.777]  Well, we've got to do it, and again folks, in every case when this happens,
[01:25:50.606 --> 01:25:55.947]  I mean, you've got tyranny, and, you know, I call it the elite media, whether it's the Republicans or the Democrat media.
[01:25:56.327 --> 01:25:59.248]  They don't get into these real issues, or they pay it lip service.
[01:25:59.628 --> 01:26:02.849]  Oh, somebody has a right to be out of pain, or a right to die.
[01:26:02.869 --> 01:26:03.949]  We're not talking about that.
[01:26:03.989 --> 01:26:08.650]  We mean the government killing you, or your own family being able to do it, because they want your money.
[01:26:09.710 --> 01:26:11.370]  Where is Terry's case right now?
[01:26:11.410 --> 01:26:14.751]  I know that we fought three separate times now, and they've unplugged her.
[01:26:15.655 --> 01:26:18.996]  She fights for weeks without water, anything, and then comes back.
[01:26:19.617 --> 01:26:20.757]  But where is she right now?
[01:26:21.838 --> 01:26:24.499]  There are two separate cases still going on.
[01:26:24.519 --> 01:26:37.364]  The guardianship case, where she is still being denied her right to rehabilitation, and her rehab money from the malpractice lawsuit has been spent on lawyers to get the right to pull her feeding tube that the husband is trying to seek.
[01:26:37.904 --> 01:26:41.365]  And then on the other hand, there's Terry's Law No.
[01:26:41.385 --> 01:26:41.645]  1, which
[01:26:43.527 --> 01:27:01.992]  is the one that got her feeding tube reinserted last fall and the um... uh... michael shiva was trying to get that law declared unconstitutional and that's a case of of shiva versus um... governor bush and the legislature uh... who passed that law so how can folks how can folks help
[01:27:05.334 --> 01:27:07.555]  You know, sway the court of public opinion.
[01:27:07.595 --> 01:27:14.439]  How do we... I mean, this guy is a demonic hobgoblin, to use theatrical terms.
[01:27:14.979 --> 01:27:18.080]  I mean, he won't even let her, for what, six years brush her teeth.
[01:27:18.621 --> 01:27:20.262]  Folks, this woman is being tortured.
[01:27:20.542 --> 01:27:21.942]  How do we get him to lose custody?
[01:27:23.363 --> 01:27:33.748]  That is a really good question, and I think really that the public, through the press, in Florida especially, needs to hear from people that they're concerned
[01:27:34.224 --> 01:27:40.186]  About the, you know, abuse of this woman that has taken place in guardianship.
[01:27:40.226 --> 01:27:49.870]  The idea that someone who wants her dead has guardianship instead of the parents who want to take care of her and are with her.
[01:27:49.890 --> 01:27:54.292]  The fact that they don't have guardianship is an outrage.
[01:27:55.092 --> 01:27:57.253]  Alright, give us the website for Not Dead Yet.
[01:27:58.233 --> 01:28:02.775]  www.notdeadyet.org and to get more facts about the case
[01:28:03.614 --> 01:28:06.295]  www.terrysfight.org.

[01:28:14.078 --> 01:28:14.299]  Yes.
[01:28:15.019 --> 01:28:18.920]  Alright, well, Diane Coleman, it's good to have this big coalition together.
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:23.402]  It is major news, but notice that I had to get this from your own press release.
[01:28:23.442 --> 01:28:25.483]  Well, we're glad you noticed, that's for sure.
[01:28:25.503 --> 01:28:27.504]  Well, we're glad a listener didn't send it to us.
[01:28:28.084 --> 01:28:29.965]  Thank you for coming on, and Godspeed, Diane.
[01:28:29.985 --> 01:28:30.705]  You're doing good work.

[01:31:49.668 --> 01:31:59.351]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:00.011 --> 01:32:02.352]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:03.352 --> 01:32:11.534]  Alright, coming up in a few minutes we'll be talking to Paul Watson and taking your calls for those of you that have been patiently holding.
[01:32:14.346 --> 01:32:19.628]  Of course, we'll get into the open discussion of suspending the election and martial law.
[01:32:21.869 --> 01:32:31.373]  In years past, you'd have to tune into a show like this to hear about how they were constructing the mechanisms to carry this out, and then magically now they're announcing it.
[01:32:31.393 --> 01:32:40.897]  So we'll get into that and just a whole plethora of news with Paul Watson, our webmaster and resident scholar at theprisonplanet.com and prisonplanet.tv websites.
[01:32:41.736 --> 01:32:50.561]  I wanted to get this guy up on the show because he's been a sponsor for a couple months, and I like to do this sometimes, because, I mean, they've been around for decades and are a great company.
[01:32:51.102 --> 01:32:57.565]  They're Ruddy Reserve Foods, and they've gained a reputation for providing virtually the finest dehydrated, scornable foods available.
[01:32:57.906 --> 01:33:03.509]  Perhaps that's why they are the oldest continually operated dehydrated food company in the United States.
[01:33:04.187 --> 01:33:10.452]  Food units need no refrigeration because they are nitrogen packed with vastly extends their shelf life.
[01:33:10.492 --> 01:33:14.315]  The food units are compact and can be customized to fit your individual needs.
[01:33:14.775 --> 01:33:28.325]  Get a deluxe three months food supply for one adult normally $4.98 for half price by calling 1-800-453-2202 or visit their website at ReadyReserveFoods.com.
[01:33:28.886 --> 01:33:31.848]  If you have been procrastinating because you don't want
[01:33:32.555 --> 01:33:33.917]  I don't know where to begin.
[01:33:34.037 --> 01:33:41.825]  Call Ready Reserve Foods and ask for their free emergency preparedness checklist or call and get the deluxe three-month food supply.
[01:33:41.845 --> 01:33:45.309]  Nitrogen-packed, storable food for half price for only $249.
[01:33:47.651 --> 01:33:52.794]  Folks, when I go to the grocery store, I mean, twice a week, I spend $150, $200 each time.
[01:33:52.854 --> 01:33:54.215]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[01:33:54.535 --> 01:33:56.816]  And these are high-quality storable foods.
[01:33:57.056 --> 01:33:58.057]  I have some storable foods.
[01:33:58.777 --> 01:33:59.778]  I have a little bit of gold.
[01:33:59.838 --> 01:34:01.019]  I have a few firearms.
[01:34:01.079 --> 01:34:02.640]  I mean, this is just basic stuff.
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:07.903]  The government has giant bunkers, years of food, underground reservoirs.
[01:34:08.303 --> 01:34:09.644]  That's normal for them, though.
[01:34:10.484 --> 01:34:12.005]  But for you, you're not supposed to do that.
[01:34:12.868 --> 01:34:20.930]  It's something that's important, that lasts for a decade, you need to get it, and it is just a basic insurance policy.
[01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:26.232]  And to spend a few minutes with us is Dave Shibley, and the owner of Ready Reserve Foods.
[01:34:26.632 --> 01:34:28.613]  And Dave, it's good to have you on with us, my friend.
[01:34:29.093 --> 01:34:29.933]  Alex, how are you doing today?
[01:34:30.433 --> 01:34:30.933]  You bet!
[01:34:31.594 --> 01:34:39.956]  Tell us a little bit about your company, longest running, continually running in the country, not a fly-by-night operation, and why you think folks should have some storable foods.
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:43.502]  We've been in continuous operation for 33 years now.
[01:34:45.423 --> 01:34:52.549]  Like a lot of the companies that came and went with Y2K, we have folks call us that bought from these companies that are now defunct.
[01:34:52.729 --> 01:34:55.251]  They're looking for them because they're having problems with their food.
[01:34:56.612 --> 01:34:57.872]  We try to answer their questions.
[01:34:58.793 --> 01:34:59.494]  We're still here.
[01:34:59.514 --> 01:35:08.500]  The whole idea of preparedness, just listening to your show, the threats that are out there,
[01:35:10.555 --> 01:35:12.617]  It only makes good sense now to be prepared.
[01:35:13.377 --> 01:35:18.501]  One little glitch in the supply chain that everybody could be without for a long period of time.
[01:35:19.802 --> 01:35:25.426]  One good terrorist attack, and they're talking about that and delaying the elections.
[01:35:26.167 --> 01:35:31.651]  Everything will have to be shut down, grind to a halt while they take stock of the damage and maybe to thwart any more
[01:35:33.041 --> 01:35:46.667]  Well, especially if there's a smallpox attack, that will cause at least regional panic, bedlam, and we're not like the hardy folks even in the cities of the Depression that knew how to have a garden and who had morals.
[01:35:47.167 --> 01:35:53.370]  I mean, these Lexus-driving yuppies will turn into savage beasts like they did in Argentina three years ago.
[01:35:53.390 --> 01:35:55.911]  Yeah, you ought to live here in Southern California.
[01:35:56.611 --> 01:35:58.812]  That's a fright for me, too.
[01:35:58.872 --> 01:36:00.073]  I think about that all the time.
[01:36:01.141 --> 01:36:09.164]  But if you look at the dynamics of, say, there is an anthrax attack, even regionally, the system will come to a complete halt.
[01:36:09.284 --> 01:36:10.784]  Where are all the truck drivers going to go?
[01:36:10.964 --> 01:36:11.925]  They're all going to go home.
[01:36:12.845 --> 01:36:16.106]  They're not going to bring you, they're not going to stick around for this.
[01:36:16.686 --> 01:36:18.947]  So the system in your regional area will quit.
[01:36:19.958 --> 01:36:22.620]  The stores will empty out in a matter of a few hours.
[01:36:23.641 --> 01:36:30.126]  This just happened with an IMF-induced, we have our own documents, depression in Argentina.
[01:36:30.707 --> 01:36:31.928]  A depression can do this.
[01:36:33.269 --> 01:36:33.769]  Exactly.
[01:36:34.270 --> 01:36:40.595]  Now, I just emailed you last week some pictures of my little visit to Hoover Dam.
[01:36:40.615 --> 01:36:41.175]  Did you get them?
[01:36:41.976 --> 01:36:42.556]  Yes, I did.
[01:36:44.130 --> 01:36:45.031]  Tell folks about that.
[01:36:45.411 --> 01:36:48.232]  Well, I've sent the pictures to Alex.
[01:36:48.392 --> 01:36:50.434]  The west is running out of water.
[01:36:51.174 --> 01:36:58.258]  There is an unbelievable crisis and the authorities aren't talking about it in water and Alex will support me on this.
[01:36:58.939 --> 01:37:05.022]  Hoover Dam, if you fell off the dam into the water now, the fall to the water normally would have been about 20 feet.
[01:37:05.202 --> 01:37:06.983]  Now it's probably about 150 feet.
[01:37:07.023 --> 01:37:08.224]  The fall might even kill you.
[01:37:09.185 --> 01:37:10.105]  The lake is over half empty.
[01:37:12.225 --> 01:37:25.427]  My family and I went through the tour on the dam and they were telling us that in two more years of the present situation of this ten year drought, Lake Powell, which is a monster lake further upstream, will be empty.
[01:37:26.347 --> 01:37:29.308]  Well, the left is literally running out of water.
[01:37:29.388 --> 01:37:32.769]  I travel through the state, all of our reservoirs are way down.
[01:37:34.069 --> 01:37:41.450]  And the day is quickly approaching when there will be a moratorium on construction here in Southern California and water rationing.
[01:37:42.148 --> 01:37:50.371]  Well when that happens it will send economic reverberations all the way across this country and around the world.
[01:37:50.451 --> 01:37:53.331]  California is the sixth largest economy in the world.
[01:37:53.632 --> 01:37:58.193]  Well I just want to point out that regardless of the climate stuff or anything,
[01:37:58.982 --> 01:38:07.072]  We are entering a time of intensified crisis, and I told everybody that I thought Y2K by six months in was a government fraud excuse to put in command bunkers.
[01:38:07.132 --> 01:38:08.294]  I'm on record saying that.
[01:38:08.874 --> 01:38:14.041]  But the stuff that's happening now is real, folks, and it's just a good insurance policy.
[01:38:14.261 --> 01:38:15.302]  I have storable foods.
[01:38:16.283 --> 01:38:17.345]  I have a six-month supply.
[01:38:18.221 --> 01:38:19.842]  And I'm thinking about expanding it.
[01:38:20.502 --> 01:38:23.383]  And Runny Reserve Foods is a preeminent name out there.
[01:38:23.423 --> 01:38:25.023]  I plan to get some from them.
[01:38:25.043 --> 01:38:27.464]  We all need to stop procrastinating.
[01:38:27.744 --> 01:38:29.264]  There's a lot of reasons to do this.
[01:38:29.344 --> 01:38:34.026]  And then in a couple years, we're in the big crisis, and we hope there isn't, you can eat your food.
[01:38:34.066 --> 01:38:36.166]  You can, you know, it's good food.
[01:38:36.707 --> 01:38:40.428]  Just real quick, tell folks a little bit about the food and then the phone number to call.
[01:38:40.448 --> 01:38:41.508]  All right.
[01:38:41.688 --> 01:38:44.609]  The food is high quality dehydrated food.
[01:38:44.909 --> 01:38:47.670]  It's normal foods that have been dehydrated down to where
[01:38:48.277 --> 01:38:50.338]  The moisture has been removed.
[01:38:50.679 --> 01:38:54.621]  In some instances, not all of it completely, because you can dry some foods too far.
[01:38:55.462 --> 01:39:04.448]  And that's where our 33 years of experience come from, is where to get the food, how to get them dried, and what quantities to put certain ingredients in.
[01:39:04.528 --> 01:39:07.730]  And by the way, your stuff's all American.
[01:39:08.031 --> 01:39:11.513]  Every product that we sell is from the United States, except for the bananas.
[01:39:12.013 --> 01:39:15.536]  We have to get the bananas out of the Philippine Islands.
[01:39:15.956 --> 01:39:17.337]  We don't grow bananas in this country.
[01:39:17.842 --> 01:39:20.863]  And on a rare occasion, the wheat will come from Canada.
[01:39:21.963 --> 01:39:27.804]  Other than that, a little side point, we cannot find celery, dried celery, in this country.
[01:39:28.265 --> 01:39:29.545]  It's starting to come from China.
[01:39:29.805 --> 01:39:30.765]  We won't sell it now.
[01:39:32.145 --> 01:39:36.166]  Everything seems to be, now our food is coming, our survival food is coming from China.
[01:39:37.127 --> 01:39:39.187]  It's really tearing us up.
[01:39:39.227 --> 01:39:41.468]  Well, tell folks about the special and let's give them the number.
[01:39:42.048 --> 01:39:46.629]  Okay, for the remainder of this month, the three month supply for one adult,
[01:39:47.381 --> 01:39:48.882]  It's literally half price.
[01:39:48.942 --> 01:39:50.443]  Alex has told you about that.
[01:39:50.503 --> 01:39:55.086]  You can contact us at 800-453-2202.
[01:39:55.947 --> 01:40:03.432]  Another point I'd like to make is businesses and brokers and companies we've done business with for decades now are gone.
[01:40:04.653 --> 01:40:08.736]  They've been gobbled up, spun off, literally are defunct.
[01:40:08.816 --> 01:40:10.137]  Brokers are out of business.
[01:40:11.678 --> 01:40:15.320]  It's getting harder and harder to fulfill.
[01:40:17.185 --> 01:40:19.127]  Keep this whole thing as pre-preparedness.
[01:40:19.587 --> 01:40:27.135]  If you're going to do this, which we strongly urge, because the threats out there are real, is to get it done now.
[01:40:27.631 --> 01:40:31.472]  Because any of these threats can lock the country up, and you can go without.
[01:40:31.732 --> 01:40:42.534]  Well, I mean, when we have a tornado and people run out to buy, or a snowstorm, I mean, I remember growing up in Dallas, it'd be a little bit of a snowstorm, and you'd go to try to buy milk, anything, for two or three days, there'd be nothing.
[01:40:42.954 --> 01:40:44.655]  It's just common sense, folks.
[01:40:44.735 --> 01:40:45.455]  Give them a call.
[01:40:45.995 --> 01:40:47.195]  And again, that toll-free number, 800-453-2202.
[01:40:47.215 --> 01:40:47.255]  800-453-2202.
[01:40:54.838 --> 01:40:57.482]  ReadyReserveFoods.com.
[01:40:57.582 --> 01:41:00.027]  We have a banner at the bottom of Infowars.com.
[01:41:01.284 --> 01:41:03.106]  Over to them, and it's something you need to do.
[01:41:03.466 --> 01:41:07.931]  Dave, thank you so much for your sponsorship and your great products, and God bless you.
[01:41:08.371 --> 01:41:08.912]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:41:09.212 --> 01:41:09.512]  You bet.
[01:41:09.532 --> 01:41:09.933]  Take care.
[01:41:10.173 --> 01:41:10.653]  Folks, that's 800-453-2202.
[01:41:10.673 --> 01:41:10.753]  800-453-2202.
[01:41:10.813 --> 01:41:15.618]  Just give them a call.
[01:41:15.658 --> 01:41:18.401]  They'll answer your questions.
[01:41:18.441 --> 01:41:19.382]  They're great folks.
[01:41:19.702 --> 01:41:21.183]  Okay, I appreciate everybody holding.
[01:41:23.065 --> 01:41:25.608]  That's an important issue we just covered, and we rarely do it.
[01:41:26.408 --> 01:41:30.230]  Let's go to Paul Watson, who's waiting in the wings, patiently, and then to your calls.
[01:41:30.930 --> 01:41:32.490]  Paul, there's a lot to cover today.
[01:41:32.510 --> 01:41:39.753]  I want to go right into calls, but first off, the next hour and 16-17 minutes we've got left in this global broadcast, what are we going to cover?
[01:41:40.833 --> 01:41:51.677]  Well, the only two things on my agenda, and then, you know, whatever you other callers throw up, are the fear-mongering surrounding the possible cancellation or delay of the election.
[01:41:52.546 --> 01:42:03.259]  And the questions as to why the New York Times and others have started to seriously discuss the Bilderberg Group and the fact that it has influence over American politics.
[01:42:03.319 --> 01:42:04.541]  So those two issues alone.
[01:42:06.454 --> 01:42:12.660]  You know, that's incredible, and we have that New York Times article, what you reposted it again yesterday from last Wednesday.
[01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:24.412]  We ought to post that in the Bilderberg section so we don't lose it, you know, into the Labyrinthine Archive itself, where they just come out and go, yeah, the Bilderberg group who really runs things, Global Elite,
[01:42:25.948 --> 01:42:27.428]  The headline even was talking about it.
[01:42:27.448 --> 01:42:31.829]  Yeah, well, they thought Edwards was good, so they called Kerry up and said, we want him.
[01:42:31.869 --> 01:42:33.010]  And he was picked.
[01:42:33.070 --> 01:42:42.552]  I mean, just a few years ago, three years ago, I was attacked viciously by the New York Times Book Review, saying Mr. Jones believes in the Bilderberg Group.
[01:42:42.592 --> 01:42:43.852]  I mean, I was a lunatic.
[01:42:44.953 --> 01:42:45.633]  Paul, comments?
[01:42:46.753 --> 01:42:49.574]  Well, yeah, the question is, I mean, why are they talking about it now?
[01:42:50.014 --> 01:42:54.575]  And on one level, it is because of the credibility of the alternative media.
[01:42:55.071 --> 01:43:16.361]  ...has risen in the last few years ostensibly because, you know, we've made the predictions and assertions which have later actually happened, coupled with the fact that governments are getting worse and worse at covering up lies, because, you know, in this new technological age where information and outlets of information are far more plentiful and faster,
[01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:26.667]  That has caused some mainstream journalists who are actually, you know, doing their job, doing the investigations, to borrow from us the conclusions we make and then print them in their newspapers.
[01:43:26.767 --> 01:43:29.309]  Well, they've got to answer us and they've got to counter us.
[01:43:29.389 --> 01:43:44.760]  I mean, when my websites get tens of millions of visitors a month, and there's websites out there that are a lot bigger than ours, Paul, when the TV and the newspapers have lost 45% of their audience, they're in panic mode, Paul.
[01:43:45.984 --> 01:43:48.945]  Well they are and I mean these are the websites that are bigger than ours.
[01:43:50.125 --> 01:43:58.206]  I mean I track this every day and they do, the nice term is borrow from us because you know everything that we highlight they seem to highlight which is fine.
[01:43:59.066 --> 01:44:01.827]  It would be nice if we got some credit as he said earlier.
[01:44:02.247 --> 01:44:09.008]  But at least you know they're not just taking our words and twisting them to make us look like kooks as was the more established tactic.
[01:44:09.568 --> 01:44:15.329]  So you know fair-minded journalists are researching our claims, finding them to be accurate and including them
[01:44:15.822 --> 01:44:16.743]  In their articles.
[01:44:17.043 --> 01:44:18.263]  And I mean, that's one level.
[01:44:18.604 --> 01:44:31.470]  But I mean, the question is, why are the editors of these newspapers, many of which are, you know, Bilderberg members themselves, and supposedly sworn to secrecy, why are they choosing to print those articles in higher and higher volumes?
[01:44:31.550 --> 01:44:32.911]  Well, they said it five years ago.
[01:44:32.931 --> 01:44:38.874]  We started seeing their own, you know, intramural reports where they would say, look, they're on to our New World Order.
[01:44:38.914 --> 01:44:40.595]  We keep stonewalling it.
[01:44:40.936 --> 01:44:42.316]  You know, it really hurts us.
[01:44:42.636 --> 01:44:43.897]  We've got to put a spin on it.
[01:44:44.958 --> 01:44:45.438]  Yes, because
[01:44:45.891 --> 01:45:03.202]  I mean, they know that if the general populace is aware of the information, and, you know, they are to an increasing degree through our work and the work of others, then if the mainstream then ignores that information, it will make the general population more suspicious of the motives of both media and government.
[01:45:03.697 --> 01:45:09.482]  So, as he said, it's better for them to put it out in the open and then absolve themselves of the charge of cover-up.
[01:45:09.862 --> 01:45:27.858]  Which is why, when you see a skull and bones piece, which we see almost every other month on the mainstream TV networks, the anchor will use the somewhat sophisticated tactic of asking, you know, if this is all so secretive, then why are you being allowed to talk about it on television in front of millions of people?
[01:45:29.124 --> 01:45:37.210]  If people become familiar with the concept, even one such as the New York Times admitted two days ago, you know, Bildberg's agenda is to create world government.
[01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:39.191]  That's right, a new article, it's the second article.
[01:45:40.412 --> 01:45:47.316]  Yeah, the first one included two paragraphs on the Edwards election, the second article was a full length, solely about Bildberg.
[01:45:47.896 --> 01:45:58.083]  But I mean, if that's in the New York Times, then any possible dark motives behind it lessen in impact if that reader, that general, you know, dumb-down slave,
[01:45:58.840 --> 01:45:59.581]  I don't know.
[01:46:18.474 --> 01:46:19.375]  Oh, all the time now.
[01:46:19.395 --> 01:46:21.977]  I mean, they come out and say, we're going to put the chips in the school children.
[01:46:22.017 --> 01:46:22.637]  It's going to happen.
[01:46:22.657 --> 01:46:23.498]  We don't even cover it.
[01:46:23.518 --> 01:46:25.899]  It's like, oh, well, we already heard that, you know, eight years ago.
[01:46:26.279 --> 01:46:27.440]  Let's take a few calls here.
[01:46:28.381 --> 01:46:29.081]  Perry hung up.
[01:46:29.101 --> 01:46:30.082]  You were up next, Perry.
[01:46:30.422 --> 01:46:31.583]  Mike in Ohio.
[01:46:31.983 --> 01:46:33.724]  Then Carson, Cliff.
[01:46:35.085 --> 01:46:36.286]  Oh, Mike hung up, too.
[01:46:36.726 --> 01:46:37.327]  Sorry, folks.
[01:46:37.667 --> 01:46:38.728]  Carson in Colorado.
[01:46:38.748 --> 01:46:39.428]  Go ahead, Carson.
[01:46:40.469 --> 01:46:41.289]  Hi, Alex.
[01:46:41.430 --> 01:46:45.312]  Great segment with the previous guest.
[01:46:45.552 --> 01:46:46.553]  That's real important.
[01:46:46.914 --> 01:46:49.715]  You've got to be a miracle worker in some ways.
[01:46:49.775 --> 01:47:01.281]  I'm not going to stroke the host here, but it is truly overwhelming and I want to commend everyone backstage, as it were, who probably put in some pretty phenomenal hours, don't they?
[01:47:02.031 --> 01:47:03.272]  Well, we all work pretty hard.
[01:47:03.332 --> 01:47:06.234]  I mean, the problem is there's so much evil we can't even cover it all.
[01:47:06.994 --> 01:47:11.257]  And frankly, I get what they call, you know, tyranny exhaustion.
[01:47:11.577 --> 01:47:14.660]  I mean, most of the time I don't even want to cover all this evil.
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.401]  I'm so sick of focusing on it.
[01:47:16.421 --> 01:47:18.242]  I'm just like, ugh, it's horrible, people!
[01:47:18.502 --> 01:47:19.743]  Well, I even love your rants.
[01:47:19.763 --> 01:47:22.085]  You know, a lot of us who really care about you.
[01:47:22.105 --> 01:47:24.006]  There's a lot of active duty military guys, by the way.
[01:47:24.026 --> 01:47:26.888]  I'm right down here in the belly of the beast in North Com.
[01:47:29.008 --> 01:47:36.916]  There's a lot of active duty guys, both EM and younger officers who are not just scared to death, they are getting very angry.
[01:47:40.939 --> 01:47:46.600]  I don't know how to do this, but some of them would be willing to be interviewed if we could screen their voice a little bit.
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:48.241]  But regardless, that's not why I called.
[01:47:48.261 --> 01:47:53.262]  Unfortunately, sir, I can't have anybody on with a security clearance.
[01:47:53.482 --> 01:47:54.042]  I understand.
[01:47:54.102 --> 01:47:55.943]  And violate a national security paper.
[01:47:55.963 --> 01:47:56.523]  I understand that.
[01:47:56.563 --> 01:48:00.204]  But, I mean, we already know all the globalist activities because of the formations.
[01:48:01.004 --> 01:48:01.444]  Exactly.
[01:48:01.544 --> 01:48:04.445]  I mean, you can look at the threat assessment of the globalists.
[01:48:05.045 --> 01:48:07.086]  I mean, you can look at their chess board.
[01:48:07.106 --> 01:48:08.486]  You can see exactly what they're doing.
[01:48:09.173 --> 01:48:09.733]  But go ahead.
[01:48:10.134 --> 01:48:37.610]  Well, we are making headway, and I want to also commend your listenership for the incredible response early this spring when the Pentagon was forced to cancel the agreement with Accenture out of Bermuda to form the residue of the accounting firm behind Enron that was going to organize, institute, and operate the Pentagon's overseas voting program for American civilian workers and military.
[01:48:38.612 --> 01:48:41.715]  Within 10 days, that entire program collapsed.
[01:48:43.035 --> 01:48:51.741]  Well, that's their biggest problem, is so many of their bodies are very shady and have a lot of their people being indicted, so it's hard for them to people their mechanisms with criminals.
[01:48:52.001 --> 01:48:55.424]  You say folks at NorthCom are concerned and angry and afraid.
[01:48:55.444 --> 01:48:58.386]  I mean, you guys and gals, listen to the show.
[01:48:58.406 --> 01:49:00.227]  What do you think of what we're laying out here?
[01:49:01.704 --> 01:49:03.626]  Well, are you asking them or are you asking me, Alex?
[01:49:03.646 --> 01:49:04.947]  Well, I mean, you say you talk to them.
[01:49:05.007 --> 01:49:06.749]  I talk to them on a daily basis.
[01:49:07.169 --> 01:49:08.010]  And what are they telling you?
[01:49:08.870 --> 01:49:09.751]  They're afraid to talk.
[01:49:10.592 --> 01:49:13.354]  You know, some of them I socialize with.
[01:49:14.095 --> 01:49:17.258]  We hunt, we camp, we fish, we shoot bows and arrows.
[01:49:17.778 --> 01:49:22.102]  They just can't wait to get out and they're afraid to death that they're not going to be able to get out.
[01:49:22.122 --> 01:49:24.004]  A lot of these guys went in.
[01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:28.842]  You know, starry-eyed, they're young, they're patriotic, in the old sense, in the best sense.
[01:49:29.342 --> 01:49:30.902]  Tell you what, stay there, Carson.
[01:49:30.922 --> 01:49:32.503]  We'll talk more about it with Paul Watson.
[01:49:32.803 --> 01:49:36.644]  When we get back, we'll talk to Cliff and Kara and everybody else.
[01:49:37.085 --> 01:49:43.707]  Wide open phones, a ton of news in the next hour and ten minutes.
[01:49:43.727 --> 01:49:44.067]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:49:44.707 --> 01:49:45.288]  Stay with us.
[01:49:45.388 --> 01:49:46.108]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:46.128 --> 01:49:48.209]  And don't forget the website, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:49:53.351 --> 01:50:00.196]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:00.496 --> 01:50:01.877]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.077 --> 01:50:04.278]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.438 --> 01:50:06.520]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:11.743]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.063 --> 01:50:16.106]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.346 --> 01:50:18.127]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.187 --> 01:50:28.851]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:28.991 --> 01:50:30.891]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:31.091 --> 01:50:34.953]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns in the Info War.
[01:50:35.053 --> 01:50:36.614]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533139.

[01:50:52.415 --> 01:50:55.437]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:50:55.757 --> 01:51:00.680]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:05.282]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:05.583 --> 01:51:14.508]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:14.708 --> 01:51:18.350]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:51:18.610 --> 01:51:23.653]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:23.934 --> 01:51:30.678]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:31.158 --> 01:51:31.699]  What about you?
[01:51:32.458 --> 01:51:37.360]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35.

[01:51:53.490 --> 01:51:53.830]  I think so.

[01:52:59.948 --> 01:53:04.412]  Alright folks, Carson in Colorado.
[01:53:04.472 --> 01:53:19.803]  So when you talk to folks that are there at the Military Dictatorship Command Base at NORTHCOM, and they've got their Head General Eberhardt spouting off about the Pentagon, watching the people, and you know, martial law, you know, being a good thing.
[01:53:19.824 --> 01:53:23.346]  I mean, you're out hunting and camping with them.
[01:53:23.386 --> 01:53:25.868]  I mean, do they say why they're concerned, why they want out?
[01:53:27.249 --> 01:53:28.310]  His phone just dropped.
[01:53:29.292 --> 01:53:29.532]  Hmm.
[01:53:29.933 --> 01:53:30.413]  Well, I wonder.
[01:53:30.433 --> 01:53:34.557]  I wanted to hear more about that from Carson in Colorado.
[01:53:34.577 --> 01:53:35.558]  We'll see if we can get back in.
[01:53:36.239 --> 01:53:37.900]  Paul, we get these emails, these calls.
[01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:39.682]  I talk to military people all the time.
[01:53:40.263 --> 01:53:45.848]  I mean, they more than anybody, if they're in these command and control sectors, know that we're just laying out the facts.
[01:53:46.989 --> 01:53:48.791]  Well, yeah, and that's the key cornerstone.
[01:53:49.502 --> 01:54:06.436]  You know, people within the power structure, that's the key cornerstone of where it begins to crumble, which is why we've seen over the past couple of years an increasing amount of whistleblowers from within government and other establishments coming out and saying the same things that we are, because, you know, just like everyone else, they're waking up to it.
[01:54:06.476 --> 01:54:13.581]  I mean, journalists who turned their noses up at Bilderberg a couple of years ago are now writing serious articles about it, so that can only be a good thing.
[01:54:14.963 --> 01:54:19.026]  We're forcing them to debate with us, and not just Stonewall, and
[01:54:20.580 --> 01:54:21.261]  It's amazing.
[01:54:22.261 --> 01:54:24.864]  Let's talk to Cliff in Virginia.
[01:54:24.904 --> 01:54:25.744]  Cliff, you're on the air.
[01:54:25.784 --> 01:54:26.225]  Go ahead.
[01:54:27.726 --> 01:54:27.906]  Hello?
[01:54:28.266 --> 01:54:28.547]  Yes.
[01:54:28.987 --> 01:54:29.207]  Oh, okay.
[01:54:29.247 --> 01:54:30.128]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:54:30.168 --> 01:54:30.408]  Good.
[01:54:30.989 --> 01:54:39.816]  It was kind of a response to Mr. Icke's interview yesterday, which I really enjoyed that show to where you and he were kind of at odds about the New World Order against Christians.
[01:54:41.057 --> 01:54:44.160]  And I just wondered, I've got two questions and a quick comment for you.
[01:54:44.180 --> 01:54:45.381]  I'd like to get your thoughts on them.
[01:54:45.981 --> 01:54:48.183]  One is, do you know who Stephen Ames is?
[01:54:48.223 --> 01:54:49.104]  And number two is,
[01:54:49.588 --> 01:54:51.329]  Do you know if he ever got his children back?
[01:54:53.069 --> 01:54:54.670]  No, it doesn't ring a bell.
[01:54:55.651 --> 01:55:03.714]  Well, he was arrested in 1995 in the state of Pennsylvania, he and his wife, for reading the Constitution and the Bible to their children.
[01:55:04.628 --> 01:55:09.310]  Well, I've seen similar cases where they call that abuse, and I'm not kidding, folks.
[01:55:09.370 --> 01:55:21.876]  And now in Europe, and they've passed laws in places like Pennsylvania, last year Mark Schweiker, the Republican governor, that reading passages from the Old Testament criticizing homosexuality can get you arrested or fined.
[01:55:22.456 --> 01:55:24.757]  And folks, whatever happened to the First Amendment here?
[01:55:24.817 --> 01:55:25.798]  Paul Watson, comments?
[01:55:27.099 --> 01:55:28.579]  Well, yeah, you guessed it.
[01:55:28.659 --> 01:55:34.022]  A couple of years ago, Robin Pager was arrested for making statements saying that farmers should get the same rights as
[01:55:35.023 --> 01:55:37.384]  Immigrants and homosexuals, it's the same thing.
[01:55:37.425 --> 01:55:40.967]  The whole movement of hate crime is not designed to protect the individual.
[01:55:41.047 --> 01:55:44.869]  It's designed to persecute the majority, which is exactly what it's done.
[01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:59.478]  Well, the case there against Mr. Ames and his wife was the fact that they said that the government, the state of Pennsylvania, said that they were reading anti-government booklets to include the Constitution.
[01:55:59.949 --> 01:56:11.153]  Well, I know they have TV shows like Judging Amy, where almost every episode I've seen is where they're arresting evil homeschooling parents because they believe in a new world order and teach their children this hatred.
[01:56:11.493 --> 01:56:26.798]  Yeah, because the comment I was getting from the attorney of this for the government, Leslie Bryden, stated in open court, said that the parents, Mr. Ames and his wife, still believed that the Constitution was relevant and reading the Bible to their children and the Constitution was a danger to them.
[01:56:27.339 --> 01:56:27.679]  And that
[01:56:28.789 --> 01:56:35.772]  The parents in so doing this had to be mentally ill because they were reading the Bible and Constitution without having any type of training to do so.
[01:56:36.352 --> 01:56:43.395]  Well, they've been major Department of Education meetings back in the 60s where similar things were said and that's been published.
[01:56:44.516 --> 01:56:45.756]  I appreciate the call.
[01:56:45.876 --> 01:56:47.637]  It sounds crazy, folks, but it's true.
[01:56:48.017 --> 01:56:48.897]  Carson got back in.
[01:56:48.917 --> 01:56:50.678]  We'll go back to him when we come back in the next hour.
[01:56:50.718 --> 01:56:56.981]  Then Kara, Cliff, Andrea, Bernard and Kara and many, many others.
[01:56:58.444 --> 01:57:00.365]  I have several kerosene, it's interesting.
[01:57:02.166 --> 01:57:24.601]  But before I end this hour or the next thirty seconds, sign up if you're online at PrisonPlanet.tv for all my videos, weekly TV reports, my book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of text reports, best audio interviews, PrisonPlanet.tv folks, or go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to get my videos, VHS or DVD format.
[01:57:25.061 --> 01:57:25.841]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.022 --> 01:57:52.062]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.782 --> 01:57:53.903]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.543 --> 01:57:55.363]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.123 --> 01:57:57.063]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.083 --> 01:58:01.604]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.884 --> 01:58:05.985]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.206 --> 01:58:12.227]  Alright, my friends, already into hour number three of this global transmission against tyranny.
[01:58:13.447 --> 01:58:16.127]  Monday through Friday, from 11 to 2, Central.
[01:58:16.828 --> 01:58:18.608]  Back from 9 to midnight, Central.
[01:58:19.509 --> 01:58:20.550]  I'm your host.
[01:58:20.730 --> 01:58:31.059]  We're joined by my webmaster of two of my websites, PrisonPlanet.tv and PrisonPlanet.com, Paul Watson, author and researcher, a great political mind, understanding the New World Order.
[01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:34.062]  We're about to go to Carson, Andrea, Bernard, Kara, Kim.
[01:58:34.642 --> 01:58:40.988]  I want to try to hurry through these calls now because I do want to get into the discussions of suspending the election or postponing it, of martial law,
[01:58:42.056 --> 01:58:44.857]  Just a ton of vital news we haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:58:45.197 --> 01:58:49.279]  The Red Cross saying, hey, I think the globalists are taking people to third-party countries for torture.
[01:58:49.679 --> 01:58:55.161]  Secret camps, not just the... This has been public for years, but here they are now admitting it.
[01:58:56.561 --> 01:59:05.664]  But Carson in Colorado, you were talking about your friends in NORTHCOM, the North American military dictatorship they've set up, making the U.S.
[01:59:05.744 --> 01:59:08.065]  basically a military command zone.
[01:59:09.969 --> 01:59:16.232]  You talk to these folks that are in the military who are upset and concerned and that you said they won't say a lot, but I'm sure they've said something to you.
[01:59:16.272 --> 01:59:18.733]  I mean, why are they upset?
[01:59:18.773 --> 01:59:20.274]  And you said they're listening to the show.
[01:59:20.294 --> 01:59:22.755]  Well, I'm sure that some of them do.
[01:59:23.116 --> 01:59:24.677]  We do socialize them.
[01:59:24.817 --> 01:59:38.044]  I do respect, you know, the fact that they could get into some serious difficulties at work, you know, particularly vis-a-vis their clearances and all, but we keep it general and they're just, they don't want to be in the military any longer.
[01:59:39.044 --> 01:59:40.285]  These aren't all NORTHCOM guys.
[01:59:40.305 --> 01:59:42.508]  A lot of these guys are 11 Bravos.
[01:59:42.789 --> 01:59:46.674]  There are a lot of infantry guys as well down at the fort.
[01:59:47.315 --> 01:59:52.382]  I'd like to make a couple of points along those lines, Alex, and I will try to keep it real brief.
[01:59:52.843 --> 01:59:55.947]  I've got some candid shots of Dickie Myers handing
[01:59:56.623 --> 02:00:04.691]  A flag off to Eberhardt, who is the commander, and both of those guys, you've got a camera shot directly into their eyes, into their soul.
[02:00:05.071 --> 02:00:06.973]  They are wickedly unhappy.
[02:00:07.233 --> 02:00:09.235]  They know exactly what's going on.
[02:00:09.596 --> 02:00:12.118]  How they keep, you know, doing it, I'll never know.
[02:00:12.498 --> 02:00:17.583]  But we've got a lot of Kool-Aid swilling, you know, Fox boot-licking, I call them bush-bots.
[02:00:17.964 --> 02:00:21.387]  And not that Kerry's going to be any better, but perhaps Kerry won't be able to
[02:00:21.943 --> 02:00:32.385]  You know, if there is an election, and I don't think any of us are sure today that there will be an election, and that's one of the discussions we have out in the woods when we know that, you know, we're amongst ourselves.
[02:00:32.785 --> 02:00:43.407]  The reality is that we had a guy on television right here in the Denver market being interviewed by an idiot, an NBC anchor, a retired anchorman by the name of Greg Dobbs.
[02:00:43.847 --> 02:00:51.228]  The guy was an active duty military intelligence fellow on the ground in Iraq directly contradicting
[02:00:51.804 --> 02:01:20.539]  a marine general this guy was articulate he was a young captain he was spot on fearless these guys are not fooled and and we're getting so much of crap uh... out of the media you know and you know that as well as i do but the reality is things are not what they seem over there that's a testabed just like vietnam was a testabed for our nation in the sixties they're perfecting techniques tactics
[02:01:21.691 --> 02:01:23.372]  To be used against all of us, sir.
[02:01:23.512 --> 02:01:27.575]  They're creating cadres of people that'll kill women and children and torture them.
[02:01:27.595 --> 02:01:28.736]  Thanks for the call.
[02:01:29.696 --> 02:01:31.497]  Paul Watson, comments to what he was saying?
[02:01:32.258 --> 02:01:42.604]  Well, yeah, the older military personnel are becoming dissatisfied because, as he said, the cadres that will carry out the torture and the murder and the abuse, if you want to call it that.
[02:01:43.124 --> 02:01:45.606]  I mean, you know, that... Abuse is too harsh a term.
[02:01:45.646 --> 02:01:46.306]  The pressure.
[02:01:46.326 --> 02:01:48.688]  Well, I mean, these are the 1920, 21-year-old thugs.
[02:01:51.383 --> 02:01:57.550]  That they hire off the street to, you know, used to initiation rituals, which is basically what this torture is.
[02:01:57.590 --> 02:02:06.219]  And the initiation rituals on the street for something like the Crips or the Blood Street Gangs are, you know, things like killing pregnant women.
[02:02:06.259 --> 02:02:13.927]  So when they hire them into the army, then they solidify their discipline to their military commander by making them carry out these acts of
[02:02:23.390 --> 02:02:24.990]  Absolutely, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:25.030 --> 02:02:29.752]  We'll be right back and we'll talk to Andrea, Bernard, Cara, Kim and others.
[02:02:29.972 --> 02:02:31.032]  Everybody stay with us.
[02:02:32.033 --> 02:02:32.933]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:02:32.973 --> 02:02:39.075]  This is the GCN Radio Network broadcasting worldwide against the New World Order.
[02:02:45.552 --> 02:02:49.133]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[02:02:49.393 --> 02:02:50.794]  If so, hope has arrived.
[02:02:51.294 --> 02:02:52.714]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[02:02:52.995 --> 02:02:58.156]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[02:02:58.516 --> 02:03:02.998]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[02:03:03.318 --> 02:03:11.961]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[02:03:12.461 --> 02:03:13.602]  Gum disease is serious.
[02:03:14.082 --> 02:03:17.845]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[02:03:18.125 --> 02:03:24.750]  With a regular program of oral hygiene, including vitamin toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[02:03:25.091 --> 02:03:29.134]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.
[02:03:29.554 --> 02:03:31.515]  Order yours today from Cliff Scott Enterprises.
[02:03:31.775 --> 02:03:32.556]  Call toll-free 800-569-4340.
[02:03:32.576 --> 02:03:32.896]  That's 800-569-4340.
[02:03:32.936 --> 02:03:34.377]  Or visit their website at www.cliffscott.com.
[02:03:45.936 --> 02:03:50.459]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:54.883]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:55.183 --> 02:03:55.743]  We listened.
[02:03:56.043 --> 02:04:01.027]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:01.307 --> 02:04:01.788]  We listened.
[02:04:02.168 --> 02:04:05.210]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:05.650 --> 02:04:06.171]  We listened.
[02:04:06.631 --> 02:04:10.693]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:04:11.074 --> 02:04:11.554]  We listened.
[02:04:11.914 --> 02:04:17.137]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:04:17.557 --> 02:04:18.918]  Again, we listened.
[02:04:19.278 --> 02:04:26.662]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:04:27.042 --> 02:04:30.184]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by
[02:04:35.362 --> 02:04:37.504]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[02:04:48.616 --> 02:04:49.896]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:04:50.116 --> 02:04:55.838]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:04:56.138 --> 02:05:01.380]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:05.781]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:05:05.981 --> 02:05:09.762]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:05:10.042 --> 02:05:14.664]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:05:14.764 --> 02:05:21.025]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:05:21.065 --> 02:05:22.886]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:05:23.366 --> 02:05:25.467]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny today.
[02:05:25.547 --> 02:05:28.589]  Call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:05:28.669 --> 02:05:31.950]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[02:05:32.671 --> 02:05:37.033]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[02:05:37.193 --> 02:05:39.174]  You see Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[02:05:39.414 --> 02:05:40.955]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:05:41.115 --> 02:05:43.196]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:05:49.804 --> 02:05:50.444]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.105 --> 02:05:52.145]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:52.865 --> 02:05:53.986]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.626 --> 02:05:55.447]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.207 --> 02:05:57.087]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.107 --> 02:06:01.530]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.950 --> 02:06:06.072]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.787 --> 02:06:20.612]  Alright, we're about to accelerate quickly through your phone calls and back into the top news stories and most important information as we face martial law and the cancellation of elections.
[02:06:22.239 --> 02:06:24.740]  Why would they need to do that if they already control both the candidates?
[02:06:25.160 --> 02:06:28.060]  But we're getting a few calls, folks, saying, Alex, you talk too fast.
[02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:30.521]  We didn't get the number for Ruddy Reserve Foods.
[02:06:31.161 --> 02:06:37.523]  Ruddy Reserve Foods has gained the reputation of providing virtually the finest dehydrated, storable foods available.
[02:06:37.583 --> 02:06:42.524]  Perhaps that's why they are the oldest continually operated dehydrated food company in America.
[02:06:43.164 --> 02:06:49.132]  Food units need no refrigeration because they are nitrogen packed, which vastly extends their shelf life.
[02:06:49.573 --> 02:06:53.198]  The food units are compact and can be customized to fit your individual needs.
[02:06:53.618 --> 02:06:56.983]  Get a deluxe three month food supply for one adult, normally $4.98.
[02:06:58.780 --> 02:07:00.842]  Or half price, that's only $2.49 by calling them at 800-453-2202.
[02:07:00.862 --> 02:07:01.522]  800-453-2202 is the number.
[02:07:01.542 --> 02:07:03.804]  Or ReadyReserveFoods.com or there's a hyperlink at InfoWars.com.
[02:07:19.751 --> 02:07:22.412]  It's just a basic insurance policy, folks.
[02:07:22.472 --> 02:07:23.633]  It's very important.
[02:07:23.653 --> 02:07:24.253]  800-453-2202.
[02:07:27.134 --> 02:07:29.495]  Paul, let's go back to the calls.
[02:07:29.555 --> 02:07:33.137]  Let's talk to Andrea in Ohio.
[02:07:33.157 --> 02:07:33.837]  Go ahead, Andrea.
[02:07:33.877 --> 02:07:34.477]  You're on the air.
[02:07:34.977 --> 02:07:35.477]  Yes, sir.
[02:07:35.638 --> 02:07:40.159]  First, I want to commend you for having Diane Coleman on your program.
[02:07:40.379 --> 02:07:44.081]  I am a member of the disability community myself.
[02:07:45.132 --> 02:07:47.713]  And I'm very well aware of the dangers.
[02:07:47.814 --> 02:07:49.294]  So again, thank you for having me.
[02:07:49.314 --> 02:07:53.416]  Okay, for those that weren't listening to us an hour ago, why don't you bring them up to speed briefly.
[02:07:53.436 --> 02:07:58.799]  They're killing people begging for food and water out of 17 national disability groups.
[02:07:59.299 --> 02:08:00.040]  Big groups.
[02:08:00.660 --> 02:08:06.848]  Oh, including the Centers for Independent Living, the people that signed the ADA, there's a whole host of those.
[02:08:06.928 --> 02:08:16.280]  And she's the president of Not Dead Yet, and she was going over this Nazi program of eugenics called bioethics, killing people who were begging for food and water.
[02:08:16.340 --> 02:08:17.362]  Paul Watson comments?
[02:08:18.286 --> 02:08:22.389]  Well, you mentioned the word Nazi, and that's exactly how it started back in Hitler Germany.
[02:08:22.830 --> 02:08:33.618]  I mean, the Nazi eugenics movement started when a father wrote to Hitler, who had a son who was mentally disabled, and he said he wanted the state to kill his son.
[02:08:34.058 --> 02:08:43.766]  So, I mean, that gave Hitler the idea to introduce the program on a widespread basis, and it was, you know, one of the catalysts for the Holocaust, so... Oh, sure.
[02:08:44.566 --> 02:08:45.107]  Absolutely.
[02:08:45.783 --> 02:09:02.691]  And also, another brief point, if the gentleman from Chile is listening, there is a campaign, it's still going on, Sojourner's Magazine is involved in it, I'm involved in it too, to help shut down the School of the Americas.
[02:09:03.131 --> 02:09:06.352]  Which they changed the name of, but it's still a Fort Bend, Georgia.
[02:09:06.452 --> 02:09:08.453]  Yeah, it's still the School of the Americas.
[02:09:08.633 --> 02:09:09.894]  I strongly encourage
[02:09:10.926 --> 02:09:12.747]  Our listeners to get involved in that.
[02:09:12.767 --> 02:09:24.353]  Well this 1960s training pamphlet that we have posted, declassified, CI torture manual, how to torture people, that's what they teach the world how to do in Fort Benning, Georgia.
[02:09:24.613 --> 02:09:33.797]  And a final point on that, the torture memo, I kind of had to chuckle a little bit if you and Paul Watson were using that word, pressure.
[02:09:35.739 --> 02:09:39.660]  If you read the whole text of the torture memo, and I have a copy of the text.
[02:09:39.700 --> 02:09:41.181]  I think I may have sent you a copy.
[02:09:42.361 --> 02:09:44.582]  Truthout.org has a copy.
[02:09:44.602 --> 02:09:45.882]  Yeah, we've posted it.
[02:09:48.143 --> 02:09:52.964]  It refers to it as pressure, and I mean they use terms like pressure.
[02:09:53.084 --> 02:09:58.806]  And it describes in the training manual, and it's just like in the movie Conspiracy Theory, which shows off real events.
[02:09:58.846 --> 02:10:03.147]  You take somebody, put them in a special chair, lower them into a pool of water,
[02:10:03.943 --> 02:10:05.784]  And this is a loving thing you do.
[02:10:05.924 --> 02:10:09.965]  But that's not pain, and it's not intended to cause pain, quote-unquote.
[02:10:09.985 --> 02:10:11.965]  No, just panicky, horrible torture, yes.
[02:10:12.025 --> 02:10:14.066]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:10:14.246 --> 02:10:30.190]  I listened to our ABC News affiliate, Newsnet 5, out of Cleveland, actually finally had on, it was about 6 in the morning, they had the news about, you know, all the talk of suspending elections.
[02:10:30.928 --> 02:10:36.692]  And I knew because you had talked about this, had been talking about this for several couple weeks, so I wasn't completely shocked.
[02:10:37.193 --> 02:10:51.203]  But it did feel like, listening to it at six in the morning, I was standing in my mom's room, listening to it, I felt like I was in an episode of The Twilight Zone because I was standing there listening to them talking about suspending elections.
[02:10:51.563 --> 02:10:55.666]  And now on to the next news about they were talking about some celebrity or whatever.
[02:10:55.926 --> 02:10:56.547]  I mean, it was just
[02:10:57.776 --> 02:10:58.356]  It's amazing.
[02:10:58.396 --> 02:10:59.557]  Thanks for the call.
[02:10:59.637 --> 02:11:00.877]  I appreciate it.
[02:11:00.937 --> 02:11:01.837]  You know, that's the point.
[02:11:01.857 --> 02:11:03.698]  People say, well, shouldn't we have a plan?
[02:11:03.718 --> 02:11:05.178]  You know, there could be a crisis.
[02:11:05.218 --> 02:11:06.558]  You know, they could strike.
[02:11:07.138 --> 02:11:09.079]  Al Qaeda is admittedly CIA.
[02:11:09.399 --> 02:11:15.480]  The globalists in the 80s, we need to post this, by the way, Rex 84 called for how to suspend elections.
[02:11:17.361 --> 02:11:18.801]  These are the bad guys, folks.
[02:11:19.661 --> 02:11:22.422]  You notice the more liberty we give up, the worse things get, Paul.
[02:11:23.351 --> 02:11:31.895]  Well, just on the previous point, it's come out today that the famous picture of the Iraqi standing on the box with the wires attached to him, he was a car thief.
[02:11:32.295 --> 02:11:36.857]  And I mean, one of the children who got taken to the camp... Accused car thief!
[02:11:37.437 --> 02:11:39.638]  Accused car thief, not even proven.
[02:11:40.158 --> 02:11:42.239]  And one of the children taken to the camp was...
[02:11:43.906 --> 02:11:48.130]  That's an accused biscuit thief, but it turned out that he hadn't even stolen biscuits.
[02:11:48.170 --> 02:11:50.412]  He was given a biscuit by... Tell you what, that's it.
[02:11:50.472 --> 02:11:50.852]  That's it.
[02:11:51.473 --> 02:11:54.715]  Uh, Stephanie, can you find the thing where they run over the person's car with the tank?
[02:11:55.076 --> 02:11:56.037]  The audio or the video?
[02:11:56.057 --> 02:11:57.458]  Do you have that on you?
[02:11:58.599 --> 02:11:59.279]  Tell me when you get it.
[02:12:00.701 --> 02:12:02.202]  This is from Frontline, folks.
[02:12:02.502 --> 02:12:03.223]  Or no, Nova.
[02:12:03.983 --> 02:12:10.489]  And, uh, they think they might have stolen three sticks of wood, and so they machine gun the car, run over it, and laugh at them.
[02:12:10.689 --> 02:12:11.310]  Go ahead, Paul.
[02:12:12.424 --> 02:12:22.266]  And, yeah, the famous picture of the guy standing on the box, which is now called the Statue of Liberty, accused Carthy of a child who took a biscuit from a coalition troop.
[02:12:22.286 --> 02:12:26.907]  He wandered down the road to another section of troops who then accused him of stealing the biscuit.
[02:12:26.947 --> 02:12:28.508]  He was huddled and taken off to the camp.
[02:12:29.548 --> 02:12:33.869]  The Iraqis who were made to jump off the bridge, one of them drowned, died.
[02:12:34.109 --> 02:12:35.910]  They broke a curfew.
[02:12:36.230 --> 02:12:37.650]  So again, that's freedom.
[02:12:38.459 --> 02:12:41.122]  And so there's numerous examples of it.
[02:12:41.142 --> 02:12:51.935]  I mean, the Red Cross report, the military report, and there's another one out of Newsweek today, 70 to 90% were not even anything to do with the insurgency.
[02:12:51.995 --> 02:12:53.837]  Some of them weren't even common criminals.
[02:12:54.838 --> 02:12:58.322]  And so, I mean, you know, they've got the former terrorist leader in there.
[02:12:58.775 --> 02:13:03.156]  Head of the terrorist organization, he says he's going to impose martial law.
[02:13:03.416 --> 02:13:17.079]  Yeah, they say 85% of the 320-member appointed board that then appointed the new dictator, who's an admitted terrorist of movie theaters and school buses, it is made up of 80-plus percent made up of Ba'athists and Communists.
[02:13:17.799 --> 02:13:26.081]  And so they've got a coalition of Communists and Ba'athists put back in power, martial law declared, martial law provisions put into law.
[02:13:26.541 --> 02:13:27.621]  This is freedom, Paul!
[02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:32.162]  And also they've reinstated the death penalty.
[02:13:32.182 --> 02:13:41.367]  I mean, I gotta say this, when they put Saddam in as the security chief in 68, and then as dictator in 79, at least in the old days it was because he was anti-communist.
[02:13:41.787 --> 02:13:47.190]  And frankly, he did bring more freedom to Iraq than they previously had, and, you know, let Christians thrive.
[02:13:47.210 --> 02:13:53.334]  I mean, I'm not defending Saddam, he was a horrible CIA thug, but he was the old type of CIA thug who was anti-communist.
[02:13:53.574 --> 02:13:55.275]  Now they put commies in, Paul!
[02:13:56.519 --> 02:14:00.923]  Well yeah, I mean, Saddam's trial itself, they even had to censor that.
[02:14:02.164 --> 02:14:11.711]  They prevented the TV cameras from having the audio, so they just had pictures and then the transcription of the audio was later provided by the government, so who knows what Hussein was saying.
[02:14:12.192 --> 02:14:17.856]  And they've reinstated the death penalty so they can execute him, so he doesn't blow the whistle on his former business partners.
[02:14:18.477 --> 02:14:26.043]  Just like the torture masters in Afghanistan and Iraq, three of them now, charged with the Patriot Act, so they can't defend themselves or speak out and say, I was given orders.
[02:14:26.966 --> 02:14:31.707]  That's American citizens being charged with it, who followed orders, which doesn't abstain them from guilt.
[02:14:32.247 --> 02:14:35.568]  Here's a clip, folks, of a family pulled over.
[02:14:36.348 --> 02:14:39.029]  They think they might have stolen wood, so they bulldoze their cars.
[02:14:39.089 --> 02:14:40.789]  And by the way, these guys will all be cops.
[02:14:41.289 --> 02:14:45.770]  Again, that 80% number, 80 plus percent now, of the new cops or military.
[02:14:46.330 --> 02:14:48.811]  These are the guys that will be pulling your daughter over.
[02:14:49.051 --> 02:14:50.111]  Let's go ahead and play it.
[02:14:50.311 --> 02:14:52.632]  There was still some looting going on when we arrived.
[02:14:56.204 --> 02:14:59.725]  And when we came across soldiers, they didn't seem sure of their role.
[02:15:00.465 --> 02:15:02.546]  That child don't need to be here.
[02:15:02.586 --> 02:15:05.226]  You know what we do with him?
[02:15:05.246 --> 02:15:07.907]  That's what he needs to be doing, not following you.
[02:15:08.507 --> 02:15:11.908]  We filmed these G.I.s after they caught a group of Iraqis stealing wood.
[02:15:12.648 --> 02:15:18.489]  We try to stop them from looting, they don't understand, so we take their car and we crush it.
[02:15:18.529 --> 02:15:20.070]  United States Army, tankers, hold.
[02:15:22.330 --> 02:15:24.311]  They shoot the car up.
[02:15:30.326 --> 02:15:34.169]  And then an Abrams, M1A, drives over and then backs back over.
[02:15:34.209 --> 02:15:35.230]  Tells us about a full hop.
[02:15:35.250 --> 02:15:36.071]  Far far to freedom.
[02:15:36.171 --> 02:15:37.032]  Winning hearts and minds.
[02:15:59.611 --> 02:16:00.771]  That's what you get when you loot.
[02:16:02.112 --> 02:16:05.833]  Later, the car's owner told us, I'm a taxi driver.
[02:16:06.593 --> 02:16:08.073]  The car was my livelihood.
[02:16:10.094 --> 02:16:12.395]  Paul, that'll win the hearts and minds, won't it?
[02:16:13.075 --> 02:16:16.016]  Well, yeah, but I mean, Saddam had weapons of mass destruction.
[02:16:16.036 --> 02:16:22.917]  I mean, Colin Powell's speech to the UN, all the information was called from an alcoholic who said he'd witnessed that they had them.
[02:16:23.118 --> 02:16:24.578]  So, I mean, that's proof.
[02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:32.603]  Well, Dick Cheney has a good heart because his admitted drug addict doctor said so.
[02:16:42.512 --> 02:16:55.035]  But again, I mean, another thought occurred to me, if these individuals are, you know, so savage that they will do all this and torture children and make people jump off bridges, then how do their commanders maintain discipline?
[02:16:55.536 --> 02:16:58.856]  You know, how do you maintain discipline if you're trying to order around a bunch of animals?
[02:16:59.637 --> 02:17:08.099]  And as I pointed out before the break, I mean, the individuals look to their commanders as leaders of the gang, just as the, you know, they'd have leaders in their street gangs.
[02:17:08.587 --> 02:17:15.811]  So, I mean, as in those street gangs, they have to carry out barbaric acts to solidify what was Hitler's term for it?
[02:17:15.871 --> 02:17:16.712]  The oath of blood?
[02:17:17.572 --> 02:17:18.713]  The cement of blood.
[02:17:18.933 --> 02:17:20.534]  Cement of blood amongst each other.
[02:17:20.954 --> 02:17:24.636]  I mean, so, you know, they'll kill a pregnant woman on the streets of L.A.
[02:17:24.676 --> 02:17:26.757]  and so they'll kill Iraqis in Iraq.
[02:17:26.818 --> 02:17:27.838]  That's what they're there to do.
[02:17:29.479 --> 02:17:30.079]  Oh boy!
[02:17:30.099 --> 02:17:36.043]  We'll come back and talk to Bernard, Kara, Kim and others and get into more of the news.

[02:18:48.976 --> 02:18:52.417]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[02:18:52.897 --> 02:18:53.577]  Let's update.
[02:18:54.097 --> 02:18:57.538]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[02:18:58.198 --> 02:19:01.839]  The NASDAQ in that same time frame is flat.
[02:19:02.583 --> 02:19:03.544]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[02:19:03.584 --> 02:19:05.887]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[02:19:06.407 --> 02:19:07.328]  Today, the U.S.
[02:19:07.348 --> 02:19:09.570]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[02:19:09.971 --> 02:19:11.492]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[02:19:12.073 --> 02:19:14.055]  January of 2002, gold spot was $2.83.
[02:19:15.417 --> 02:19:20.282]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[02:19:21.283 --> 02:19:22.023]  Gold is moving.
[02:19:22.284 --> 02:19:23.445]  Equities are treading water.
[02:19:23.845 --> 02:19:26.388]  They say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[02:19:27.023 --> 02:19:28.404]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[02:19:28.825 --> 02:19:30.546]  Physical possession, private gold.
[02:19:30.967 --> 02:19:32.909]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.

[02:20:50.753 --> 02:20:54.216]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.

[02:21:59.139 --> 02:22:03.560]  I got a bunch of other affiliates.
[02:22:03.580 --> 02:22:04.941]  I haven't been plugging new ones.
[02:22:04.981 --> 02:22:05.661]  I need to do that.
[02:22:07.461 --> 02:22:12.143]  We really appreciate it, because all we do is cover the facts and stand up against evil, folks.
[02:22:14.274 --> 02:22:18.417]  Now, to be fair, we've got to give each caller about a minute here, because I've got a bunch of news I want to cover, too.
[02:22:19.177 --> 02:22:21.179]  Bernard in Texas, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:22:21.619 --> 02:22:22.139]  Yes, sir.
[02:22:22.280 --> 02:22:25.082]  I ordered your Road to Tyranny DVD.
[02:22:25.162 --> 02:22:33.888]  I used to own a recording studio, and I'm ready to get to copying and getting them out to people, but I'm having a problem.
[02:22:34.328 --> 02:22:39.192]  Everybody seems to be a George Wally syndrome, and I wonder if
[02:22:39.770 --> 02:22:49.396]  If you could answer honestly, if you think he's paid off, because I've heard your interviews with him, and no matter what you say, he just has the same programmed answer.
[02:22:50.196 --> 02:23:03.124]  Uh, well, I just don't think this, this, and that, and, and... No, no, no, it's George Woolley, and I've known him for years, and he's a good guy, he just, he just is wedded to the Republican Party, and is in a state of denial.
[02:23:03.505 --> 02:23:08.788]  Paul Watson, can you speak to that mindset of people that still believe they found the weapons of mass destruction?
[02:23:10.068 --> 02:23:13.229]  Well, as I've said before, it's a child-like mentality.
[02:23:13.529 --> 02:23:28.934]  They don't want to believe for a second that the people that control their lives, overly so, in their case, because they've let the government impinge on every aspect of their lives, they don't want to believe that that government, that state, that parental body, will be inherently evil.
[02:23:29.554 --> 02:23:37.997]  And so, I mean, you can't point out to these people, for example, that, you know, this new conservative index, which New American Magazine published,
[02:23:38.484 --> 02:23:50.014]  Which shows that the only admitted socialist in Congress, Bernie Sanders, has a more conservative record in terms of voting than 76% of the Republican members of the House.
[02:23:50.435 --> 02:23:53.598]  Yeah, we've got that on the website, but why don't we cover some of that in the next segment?
[02:23:53.618 --> 02:23:54.458]  Let's go over some of that.
[02:23:54.719 --> 02:23:55.920]  Say that again, I saw that.
[02:23:56.220 --> 02:24:03.987]  The most... The admitted socialist has a more conservative voting record in a real conservative index than the Republicans.
[02:24:04.682 --> 02:24:06.744]  Yeah, take Ron Paul for example.
[02:24:06.784 --> 02:24:08.846]  He scored 100 on his voting record.
[02:24:08.886 --> 02:24:11.649]  Bernie Sanders, the admitted socialist, scored a 47.
[02:24:11.789 --> 02:24:21.338]  And then 76% of the Republican members of the House and 45% of the Republican members of the Senate scored less than Sanders.
[02:24:21.458 --> 02:24:24.561]  So the socialist is more conservative than they are.
[02:24:24.921 --> 02:24:28.745]  So that's why we see these open borders, you know, giant federal expansion of government.
[02:24:29.245 --> 02:24:43.216]  Because under this Republican administration, they're wolves in sheep's clothing, which is why people like George Woolley are not open to that, because the rhetoric is there, the clothing is there, but in reality, the policies are command and control.
[02:24:43.236 --> 02:24:48.320]  My what big eyes you have, my what big teeth you have, but it's not grandma, it's the big bad wolf!
[02:24:48.941 --> 02:24:53.925]  Let me ask you one more question, I mean, real seriously, do you think the next presidency is already figured?
[02:24:54.225 --> 02:24:55.726]  Of course it is!
[02:24:55.946 --> 02:24:58.068]  It's Kerry Edwards, right, because Bush, he's
[02:24:59.025 --> 02:24:59.506]  I don't know.
[02:24:59.526 --> 02:25:00.227]  I don't know.
[02:25:00.247 --> 02:25:01.209]  I appreciate the call.
[02:25:01.850 --> 02:25:03.573]  Let's talk to Kara in Colorado.
[02:25:03.613 --> 02:25:04.374]  Kara, go ahead.
[02:25:04.394 --> 02:25:07.880]  Hi, I wanted to shift gears just for a second.
[02:25:08.381 --> 02:25:12.328]  Have either of you guys heard of Orwell Rolls and his grave?
[02:25:12.887 --> 02:25:17.408]  Yeah, it's a new documentary about a lot of Orwellian things coming true, especially with the press.
[02:25:17.688 --> 02:25:20.689]  Yeah, I wondered if you talked about it in the past, Alex?
[02:25:21.149 --> 02:25:22.530]  No, I just learned of it this morning.
[02:25:22.790 --> 02:25:23.190]  Oh, did you?
[02:25:23.290 --> 02:25:23.670]  Okay.
[02:25:24.250 --> 02:25:34.293]  Well, yeah, I had heard about it, I think, late last month, and I've been meaning to call in about it, and just wondered if you wanted me to
[02:25:34.913 --> 02:25:35.754]  Tell you a little bit about it.
[02:25:35.894 --> 02:25:37.454]  I actually haven't seen it.
[02:25:37.534 --> 02:25:39.015]  It's kind of in limited release.
[02:25:39.055 --> 02:25:42.717]  You can buy the DVD, but they have a website.
[02:25:42.757 --> 02:25:44.758]  It's OrwellRollsInHisGrave.com.
[02:25:44.778 --> 02:25:48.340]  Yeah, but doesn't it just kind of focus on the media manipulation and doublespeak?
[02:25:48.620 --> 02:25:49.320]  Yes, it does.
[02:25:50.301 --> 02:25:54.323]  But it also has a bit of a slant, I understand, from one reviewer.
[02:25:54.343 --> 02:26:03.327]  He said that it's pretty much like... It's the guy that made it, Robert... Oh, what's his name?
[02:26:05.812 --> 02:26:12.866]  Well, I got an email this morning from a filmmaker friend of mine about it, and yeah, from those that have seen it, it does seem that it's limited.
[02:26:13.900 --> 02:26:23.248]  Yes, and it's kind of like the guy, I guess the director's in love with, he said he loves him dearly, it says in the quote, Michael Moore.
[02:26:23.348 --> 02:26:32.215]  So it's very, the false left-right paradigm unfortunately appears to be in the film, but it sounds like, you know, overall it has a good message.
[02:26:32.656 --> 02:26:33.977]  Yeah, well I look forward to seeing it.
[02:26:33.997 --> 02:26:34.758]  Thanks for the call.
[02:26:35.478 --> 02:26:36.219]  Paul, comments?
[02:26:37.111 --> 02:26:51.243]  Yeah, I've seen the trailer, I've seen the website, but, you know, it's all being pushed by these liberal groups like BuzzFlash, so it's bound to have that slant on it, like Fahrenheit 9-11, so, you know, it can do some good, but it's not going to tell you the whole situation.
[02:26:52.084 --> 02:26:57.869]  Yeah, because if you just expose the Republicans, you've only done half, you know, I mean, it's just what we were talking about about the neocon.
[02:26:58.624 --> 02:27:05.007]  I mean, their whole semantical lexicon, their language, their terms, doesn't fit the real world.
[02:27:05.227 --> 02:27:09.749]  No wonder things never get fixed, folks, because you're all playing according to their terms, Paul.
[02:27:10.749 --> 02:27:13.831]  Well, yeah, I mean, that's the hypocrisy of the left.
[02:27:13.871 --> 02:27:19.333]  They care about babies being killed in Iraq, but, you know, abortion at home is something which they promote.
[02:27:19.373 --> 02:27:21.614]  So, again, it's double-thinking hypocrisy.
[02:27:22.708 --> 02:27:25.471]  Yeah, so they really need to learn about Orwell before they make films about it.
[02:27:26.052 --> 02:27:29.095]  Alright, we'll come back and talk to Kim and Tim and others.
[02:27:29.536 --> 02:27:30.337]  It's a bunch of news.
[02:27:30.357 --> 02:27:30.898]  Stay with us.
[02:27:35.783 --> 02:27:36.704]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.165 --> 02:27:38.787]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.708 --> 02:27:42.411]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.848 --> 02:27:47.189]  Is your daily commute a grind?
[02:27:47.349 --> 02:27:51.111]  If it wears on your patience, you'll be amazed at how it grinds on your car or truck, too.
[02:27:51.291 --> 02:27:54.993]  Your engine and transmission wear away mile after mile and day after day.
[02:27:55.313 --> 02:27:58.935]  Hundreds of NT Oil Additive customers have reported increased fuel mileage.
[02:27:59.155 --> 02:28:03.577]  Fleets that conduct used oil analysis report up to 30% reduction in wear metals.
[02:28:03.917 --> 02:28:07.719]  NT Oil Additive is a 100% synthetic product made to perform.
[02:28:07.959 --> 02:28:08.660]  It really works!
[02:28:08.920 --> 02:28:15.023]  NT Oil Additive has been proven in many thousands of engines, manual and automatic transmissions, and other driveline components.
[02:28:15.323 --> 02:28:16.444]  Even in two-cycle engines.
[02:28:16.724 --> 02:28:19.246]  NT Oil Additive was developed for industrial uses.
[02:28:19.406 --> 02:28:22.649]  It works in heat exchangers, air compressors, vacuum pumps and air tools.
[02:28:22.869 --> 02:28:27.933]  Gearboxes and hydraulic systems can operate up to 18 degrees cooler with NT Oil Additive.
[02:28:28.113 --> 02:28:29.554]  Diesel engines thrive on it too.
[02:28:29.755 --> 02:28:32.277]  To place your order, call King Oil Company at 800-647-4079.
[02:28:32.677 --> 02:28:36.039]  We accept MasterCard and Visa.

[02:28:41.003 --> 02:28:41.264]  That's 800-647-4079.
[02:28:46.201 --> 02:28:49.202]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:28:49.542 --> 02:28:58.365]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:28:58.685 --> 02:29:03.367]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:29:03.827 --> 02:29:10.555]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:29:10.956 --> 02:29:22.750]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:29:23.210 --> 02:29:27.672]  The Berkey Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:29:27.832 --> 02:29:30.172]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:30.192 --> 02:29:32.153]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:29:34.914 --> 02:29:35.974]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:29:45.327 --> 02:29:47.629]  The sun is getting brighter and the days are getting longer.
[02:29:47.829 --> 02:29:49.130]  Summer's just around the corner.
[02:29:49.371 --> 02:29:50.592]  What are your plans for it?
[02:29:50.892 --> 02:29:51.292]  Fishing?
[02:29:51.553 --> 02:29:51.993]  Gardening?
[02:29:52.053 --> 02:29:52.473]  Camping?
[02:29:52.674 --> 02:29:54.816]  I'm sure you'll spend more time enjoying the outdoors.
[02:29:55.036 --> 02:29:58.219]  And I'm sure the ticks and mosquitoes will spend more time enjoying you.
[02:29:58.439 --> 02:30:00.801]  It's not just itching and scratching we have to worry about.
[02:30:01.081 --> 02:30:04.464]  Now there's incurable illnesses like Lyme disease and the West Nile virus.
[02:30:04.804 --> 02:30:06.626]  DEET is proven to keep the bugs away.
[02:30:06.846 --> 02:30:09.909]  But it's also proven to cause brain damage in laboratory animals.
[02:30:10.249 --> 02:30:12.731]  That's not a choice I want to make, and I don't have to.
[02:30:12.911 --> 02:30:16.053]  Thanks to Natural Answer, available at NaturalAnswer.com.

[02:30:38.564 --> 02:30:39.224]  That's 9 to noon.
[02:30:39.244 --> 02:30:39.564]  Pacific.
[02:30:39.764 --> 02:30:41.165]  And of course back from 9 to midnight.
[02:31:04.256 --> 02:31:06.097]  Central Standard Time, that's 10 p.m.
[02:31:06.117 --> 02:31:06.618]  to 1 a.m.
[02:31:06.658 --> 02:31:06.958]  Eastern.
[02:31:07.678 --> 02:31:32.775]  We also don't just go out on the internet at infowars.com where you can listen to the show day and night, but also on your AM and FM dial and global shortwave during the day all three hours at 94.75, 9.475, and at night at 32.10, big WWCR, the global blowtorch, worldwide transmission, strong station, strongest in the U.S., it's non-government.
[02:31:34.133 --> 02:31:36.575]  I'm only going to talk to Kim, Tim, and Perry, and that's it for calls.
[02:31:36.635 --> 02:31:38.136]  I've got some news I've got to cover with Paul here.
[02:31:38.696 --> 02:31:41.818]  But quickly, Kim in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:31:42.159 --> 02:31:43.780]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:31:43.840 --> 02:31:44.520]  Thank you for the call.
[02:31:45.341 --> 02:31:49.924]  I went to a town hall meeting this weekend with Representative Lamar Smith.
[02:31:50.905 --> 02:31:51.966]  Very liberal individual.
[02:31:52.086 --> 02:31:52.926]  Oh yes, very.
[02:31:52.986 --> 02:31:53.687]  Yale grad.
[02:31:54.908 --> 02:32:00.051]  And he has introduced the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act.
[02:32:00.131 --> 02:32:00.932]  Have you heard about that?
[02:32:01.864 --> 02:32:08.709]  Yeah, and it's part of a larger package of legislation to restrict your right to sue, which is, you know... Right.
[02:32:09.670 --> 02:32:16.015]  What he said was it gives the federal judges the ability to classify a case as frivolous and just throw it out.
[02:32:16.815 --> 02:32:19.457]  Yeah, and then they'll selectively enforce everything they want.
[02:32:19.897 --> 02:32:24.561]  Exactly, and then you will have to pay the fees, like if you sued the government,
[02:32:25.199 --> 02:32:28.005]  You'd have to pay their fees for filing a frivolous lawsuit.
[02:32:28.326 --> 02:32:30.551]  That's right, and then the abuse can really heat up.
[02:32:34.005 --> 02:32:35.526]  You know, interest everybody out there.
[02:32:35.566 --> 02:32:37.328]  And again, we have a lot of frivolous lawsuits.
[02:32:37.348 --> 02:32:38.669]  We've got out-of-control lawyers.
[02:32:39.630 --> 02:32:42.372]  We've got more lawyers than any other country in the world.
[02:32:42.432 --> 02:32:43.493]  Times, many times.
[02:32:43.553 --> 02:32:48.677]  And they're about to be, in the next five years, more lawyers graduating than all practicing lawyers.
[02:32:49.077 --> 02:32:50.218]  So it is a major problem.
[02:32:50.699 --> 02:32:52.220]  But again, it's all going to be selective.
[02:32:52.240 --> 02:32:53.941]  They're going to use their lawyers on you.
[02:32:54.021 --> 02:32:55.562]  They create the climate.
[02:32:55.743 --> 02:32:56.723]  Then there's a problem.
[02:32:56.763 --> 02:32:58.525]  They go, oh, let us tie your hands.
[02:32:58.805 --> 02:33:01.247]  So we've got an army of people who just go after you.
[02:33:01.467 --> 02:33:03.589]  But then you can't protect yourself with your lawyer.
[02:33:04.198 --> 02:33:10.402]  Yes, and I was amazed, Alex, at how many people just sit there, sit there in these meetings and think these things are okay.
[02:33:10.542 --> 02:33:11.523]  They don't question it.
[02:33:11.543 --> 02:33:19.868]  Well, you know, Lamar Smith comes out and says we've got to put thumb scanners in to stop the illegals, then pushes for a waiver, and Bush has a waiver where illegals don't have to do it, but citizens do.
[02:33:19.888 --> 02:33:20.549]  Thanks for the call.
[02:33:21.189 --> 02:33:23.431]  I mean, Lamar Smith is just a piece of work, folks.
[02:33:23.771 --> 02:33:25.272]  Oh, he's so conservative.
[02:33:25.973 --> 02:33:37.564]  By the way, Paul Watson, you've got that list there of congressmen by the New American, a great organization, listing that many Republicans are more socialist than the admitted socialist member of Congress.
[02:33:38.145 --> 02:33:39.306]  Is Lamar Smith on there?
[02:33:39.326 --> 02:33:41.047]  I haven't got the list.
[02:33:41.108 --> 02:33:46.493]  I've got an article written about it, but I'm sure the list itself is at the New American website.
[02:33:47.199 --> 02:33:52.183]  Well, I mean, you've got people like Edwards on a score of 35 out of 100.
[02:33:52.223 --> 02:34:00.269]  And I mean, still, that beats a lot of so-called conservative Republicans, both in the Senate and the House of Congress.
[02:34:01.349 --> 02:34:05.432]  And then we've got the admitted socialist, repeat that, because I've got the article here too, let me dig it out.
[02:34:06.813 --> 02:34:10.996]  We've got the admitted socialist, and he's more conservative than most conservatives.
[02:34:11.797 --> 02:34:13.518]  Yeah, Bernie Sanders, he scored 47 out of 100.
[02:34:16.392 --> 02:34:27.539]  76% of the Republican members of the House and 45% of the Republican members of the Senate scored less than him, so they voted more liberally than the admitted socialist.
[02:34:27.679 --> 02:34:30.061]  And the article they give what they voted for, I mean, you know...
[02:34:31.853 --> 02:34:32.674]  Oh my goodness.
[02:34:33.214 --> 02:34:35.655]  And a lot of neocons have heard that the government's getting bigger.
[02:34:35.695 --> 02:34:36.696]  They go, oh, it's for the war.
[02:34:36.756 --> 02:34:38.777]  No, no, that's a small portion.
[02:34:38.837 --> 02:34:45.761]  It's every Department of Education, UNESCO, you know, it's every land grab you can imagine.
[02:34:45.801 --> 02:34:47.642]  It's every form of socialism.
[02:34:47.883 --> 02:34:51.865]  But again, the elite socializing our wealth and transferring it to themselves.
[02:34:52.785 --> 02:34:55.287]  Well, yeah, that's the foundation of communism, basically.
[02:34:55.727 --> 02:34:58.388]  Just imagine when the liberals get hold of it.
[02:34:58.408 --> 02:35:01.790]  I mean, that's who it's been set up for, for when they put Kerry in.
[02:35:01.851 --> 02:35:04.872]  So, I mean, just imagine the tyranny when he gets hold of all of this.
[02:35:05.092 --> 02:35:06.593]  So you think Kerry's the boy?
[02:35:07.874 --> 02:35:17.800]  Well, the New York Times mentioned that Bilderberg had recommended, I think it was, a vice president in Italy, who a month later had to resign due to a scandal.
[02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:19.901]  So, they said, don't worry,
[02:35:21.523 --> 02:35:29.973]  They said, don't be too sure, you know, the Liberals that Edwards and Kerry would get in because this guy in Italy who Bilderberg recommended had to resign.
[02:35:30.433 --> 02:35:33.597]  But as you know, Kerry has close relations to the Queen of England.
[02:35:33.637 --> 02:35:34.858]  That's always a big boon.
[02:35:34.898 --> 02:35:39.464]  Every president since Washington who has had those close relations has been the president.
[02:35:39.884 --> 02:35:40.904]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:35:40.924 --> 02:35:41.024]  Hello.
[02:35:41.044 --> 02:35:41.484]  Hello, Paul.
[02:35:41.504 --> 02:35:41.724]  Hello.
[02:35:41.744 --> 02:35:43.805]  One thing for anybody that knows anybody
[02:36:08.755 --> 02:36:10.636]  You're talking about the new lawyers coming out?
[02:36:10.976 --> 02:36:11.937]  Here's a good question for him.
[02:36:11.997 --> 02:36:19.522]  Ask him to explain to you the importance and significance of Erie v. Tompkins, 1938, and watch him draw this blank expression.
[02:36:19.922 --> 02:36:22.084]  For those of you who don't know about it, you can look it up, read about it.
[02:36:22.164 --> 02:36:29.809]  It was an essential case back when President Roosevelt was in office to switch over from
[02:36:30.310 --> 02:36:34.992]  The old constitutional form of government to this uniformed commercial code that we have now.
[02:36:35.032 --> 02:36:38.333]  But it's fun to question him on it and watch him just draw these blank states.
[02:36:38.653 --> 02:36:47.277]  Yeah, uniformed commercial code is really just all admiralty, or high seas, letter of mark, license to feed on us, the slaves.
[02:36:47.397 --> 02:36:49.638]  That's why they have the gold fringe in the courts.
[02:36:50.898 --> 02:36:54.940]  That's all significant of British admiralty or maritime law.
[02:36:55.840 --> 02:36:58.161]  And Brooks Pirage talks in there about Kerry having the most
[02:37:00.242 --> 02:37:02.123]  Well, I mean, even Reuters came out and said that.
[02:37:02.183 --> 02:37:03.323]  I mean, BBC did.
[02:37:03.363 --> 02:37:04.543]  It's not like it's any secret.
[02:37:04.783 --> 02:37:05.403]  Thanks for the call.
[02:37:05.443 --> 02:37:06.383]  Really good points, Tim.
[02:37:08.224 --> 02:37:09.204]  This is just a side issue.
[02:37:09.224 --> 02:37:15.105]  I don't know how that board, the CAMPO board, this regional government board, voted last night, but they got a plan, folks.
[02:37:15.145 --> 02:37:16.825]  I've seen the total plan about a year ago.
[02:37:17.865 --> 02:37:26.447]  All these big highways they built in Central Texas, the major roads in Austin, they're going to make them, basically all of them, giant toll roads after we pay for them.
[02:37:28.137 --> 02:37:33.079]  Again, the government's got more money than ever, and they're going to put satellite tracker taxation boxes in your cars.
[02:37:33.439 --> 02:37:35.580]  The Feds are moving with that, that's now mainstream news.
[02:37:35.920 --> 02:37:38.401]  Paul, they're getting ready to do that in England, now why don't you talk about that?
[02:37:39.102 --> 02:37:45.565]  Yeah, it was in the London Times last week, the UK government has proposed and is intending to go ahead with the program to
[02:37:46.932 --> 02:37:47.313]  Thank you.
[02:38:01.892 --> 02:38:08.714]  In the Echelon countries, New Zealand is adopting the very same program, GPS mileage tax tracking.
[02:38:09.135 --> 02:38:12.856]  And I mean, that's what Bilderberg called for at their recent meeting.
[02:38:12.876 --> 02:38:18.038]  They called for a UN tax and a tax on fuel and a mileage tracking tax.
[02:38:18.078 --> 02:38:21.839]  So it all falls in line to exactly what they're proposing worldwide.
[02:38:22.539 --> 02:38:25.700]  And, again, I've been talking about this for six, seven years.
[02:38:25.960 --> 02:38:30.761]  I mean, in industry publications, it's not a secret that you might want to start speaking out against it.
[02:38:31.721 --> 02:38:32.781]  They're getting ready for it here.
[02:38:32.921 --> 02:38:34.421]  Major states like Oregon are announcing it.
[02:38:35.201 --> 02:38:36.902]  Last call, Perry in Colorado.
[02:38:36.922 --> 02:38:37.562]  Go ahead, Perry.
[02:38:37.842 --> 02:38:38.862]  Hey, Alex.
[02:38:38.962 --> 02:38:39.582]  Love your show.
[02:38:39.662 --> 02:38:41.262]  Been listening for about six months.
[02:38:41.482 --> 02:38:42.363]  Good to have you on board.
[02:38:42.743 --> 02:38:43.943]  Well, glad to be here.
[02:38:44.223 --> 02:38:49.704]  This morning, here in Denver on 630 AM, Peter Boyles brought up
[02:38:50.423 --> 02:38:58.273]  Some kind of a recent interview, I think with Osama Bin Laden's brother or something, who said that none of those people flew out.
[02:38:58.753 --> 02:39:02.597]  Yeah, Bin Laden's half-brother went on Laird News Hour last Friday.
[02:39:02.738 --> 02:39:03.699]  Paul, we've got to get this posted.
[02:39:04.671 --> 02:39:05.211]  I didn't see it.
[02:39:05.271 --> 02:39:06.212]  Everybody told me about it.
[02:39:07.553 --> 02:39:10.814]  I talked to my good filmmaker friend who actually saw it.
[02:39:11.375 --> 02:39:12.995]  And he said, it's not true.
[02:39:13.976 --> 02:39:14.916]  I didn't get flown out.
[02:39:14.936 --> 02:39:18.738]  Well, we have the Customs Department documents.
[02:39:18.798 --> 02:39:19.939]  We need to post this in the article.
[02:39:20.299 --> 02:39:20.939]  We posted them.
[02:39:21.059 --> 02:39:22.560]  Judicial Watch, where they admit 163.
[02:39:22.600 --> 02:39:26.862]  We even said 144, which is what Moore said.
[02:39:27.323 --> 02:39:28.123]  It's admitted.
[02:39:28.203 --> 02:39:29.704]  Richard Clark has admitted it.
[02:39:30.004 --> 02:39:30.724]  It's public.
[02:39:30.804 --> 02:39:33.886]  And then he supposedly said, I didn't see it.
[02:39:34.426 --> 02:39:38.927]  He supposedly said in the piece that, by the way, where's Bin Laden?
[02:39:38.947 --> 02:39:39.628]  Are we going to catch him?
[02:39:39.668 --> 02:39:41.128]  Well, it's an interesting question.
[02:39:42.828 --> 02:39:43.209]  Go ahead.
[02:39:43.469 --> 02:39:49.130]  Okay, because I think about a week ago you mentioned that you did have copies of those documents on your website.
[02:39:49.150 --> 02:39:50.391]  Yeah, Judicial Watch does.
[02:39:50.591 --> 02:39:51.111]  We've linked to it.
[02:39:51.411 --> 02:39:51.891]  Oh, okay.
[02:39:51.911 --> 02:39:52.651]  Judicial Watch.
[02:39:52.671 --> 02:39:55.772]  I wasn't able to find that connection on your website.
[02:39:55.792 --> 02:39:57.573]  Well, our website is like a newspaper.
[02:39:57.633 --> 02:39:58.553]  We update each day.
[02:39:59.293 --> 02:40:03.538]  So you need to go back off the calendar, you know, like you have 20 stacks of newspapers in your living room?
[02:40:03.679 --> 02:40:03.899]  Right.
[02:40:03.959 --> 02:40:05.280]  You have to dig through the stacks.
[02:40:05.300 --> 02:40:07.924]  You just click on each day going back and it'll be there.
[02:40:08.504 --> 02:40:13.070]  But we are adding a better search engine to the website and somebody else has added a better one.
[02:40:13.350 --> 02:40:15.312]  I tested this morning, it worked quite nicely.
[02:40:15.573 --> 02:40:16.734]  Paul, tell us about that website.
[02:40:17.580 --> 02:40:25.908]  Yeah, someone emailed me to say they created a website solely devoted to being a search engine for both InfoWars and Prison Planet, so it's an all-in-one thing.
[02:40:26.569 --> 02:40:37.259]  I believe that the website is searchinfowars.com, so I think we'll be adopting that into both websites, so it has full search, you know, function and capability.
[02:40:37.279 --> 02:40:38.460]  We're very thankful for that.
[02:40:39.173 --> 02:40:40.435]  Can I ask you a couple more things?
[02:40:40.595 --> 02:40:41.877]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:40:42.117 --> 02:40:49.005]  A couple of days ago there was a... Hold on, I want to hear what this creature, this person locally, was saying.
[02:40:49.426 --> 02:40:52.529]  Well, Peter Boyles is kind of a middle-of-the-road talk show guy.
[02:40:52.569 --> 02:40:58.657]  He's come out a little bit critical of some Bushisms and stuff like that, but in general,
[02:40:59.272 --> 02:41:13.358]  Yeah, and generally he's pretty good, but this thing popped up and I wanted to be able to have some ammo to call in.
[02:41:13.478 --> 02:41:14.158]  What was he saying?
[02:41:14.198 --> 02:41:15.919]  I didn't see it, I just heard about it.
[02:41:16.119 --> 02:41:21.521]  He took that interview to be evident, agreeing with his neocon caller.
[02:41:22.014 --> 02:41:27.136]  That it's a fabrication that everybody flew out while the flight ban was in effect.
[02:41:27.156 --> 02:41:28.856]  The White House admits it!
[02:41:28.977 --> 02:41:30.657]  Vanity Fair has reported it!
[02:41:30.977 --> 02:41:32.558]  Richard Clark has said it!
[02:41:32.758 --> 02:41:36.219]  We have the Customs Department documents!
[02:41:36.899 --> 02:41:37.119]  Right.
[02:41:37.199 --> 02:41:39.620]  That's what I think people need to know.
[02:41:39.660 --> 02:41:45.202]  Hey, Paul, just when you get off the air, create a section on this and do a search.
[02:41:45.302 --> 02:41:46.763]  Remember I told you about it Monday?
[02:41:47.483 --> 02:41:48.624]  We need to get this posted.
[02:41:49.264 --> 02:41:49.544]  Okay.
[02:41:49.878 --> 02:42:05.438]  Well that would be fantastic and then about a couple days ago there was a C-SPAN interview and I didn't write the guy's name down but he was supposedly an ex-FBI guy and he was saying that there's supposed to be nine to twelve cities hit with suitcase nukes
[02:42:06.369 --> 02:42:07.870]  Yeah, they've had him on Fox.
[02:42:07.890 --> 02:42:09.571]  Look, the White House told U.S.
[02:42:09.611 --> 02:42:14.313]  News and World Report, and it's on the website right now, that the Capitol will be destroyed.
[02:42:14.333 --> 02:42:15.713]  There will be coast-to-coast attacks.
[02:42:15.733 --> 02:42:16.233]  Thanks for the call.
[02:42:16.594 --> 02:42:20.415]  Paul, that's a good place to get into the fake terror alert section.
[02:42:20.455 --> 02:42:25.598]  We've got the suspension or postponing of the election.
[02:42:25.798 --> 02:42:26.518]  Give us your analysis.
[02:42:27.443 --> 02:42:32.909]  Well, you just mentioned the Capitol building, and that's one of the groundworks in which they've laid this pre-attack propaganda.
[02:42:33.229 --> 02:42:44.422]  Because during the Reagan funeral procession, there was a plane which carried the governor of Kentucky to the Reagan funeral, which strayed into restricted airspace.
[02:42:45.103 --> 02:42:47.764]  And forced the Capitol building to be evacuated.
[02:42:48.264 --> 02:42:57.848]  Now, that story didn't get much attention, but from the photos and from the articles that did come out, there were police running around screaming at people to run because a plane was about to hit in two minutes.
[02:42:57.868 --> 02:43:01.170]  So, I mean, the members of Congress have already been prepared for this.
[02:43:01.210 --> 02:43:02.470]  They're in a state of fear.
[02:43:03.451 --> 02:43:11.074]  But, I mean, with this announcement of postponing the election being so public, I don't actually think they'll do anything on the election day.
[02:43:11.917 --> 02:43:25.427]  What they're going to do, in my estimation, is use it to raise the Homeland Security colour code to a red alert, and it will be kind of a martial law drill, which will make a lot of people, in the big cities at least, stay in their homes and not vote.
[02:43:25.907 --> 02:43:32.292]  Which again, you know, conditions them that voting is some kind of privilege afforded to them by government.
[02:43:33.149 --> 02:43:34.390]  As opposed to an individual vote.
[02:43:34.410 --> 02:43:36.131]  And we've never had elections cancelled.
[02:43:36.211 --> 02:43:37.551]  It introduces the mindset.
[02:43:37.571 --> 02:43:40.593]  So with Bush and Kerry, both horses are owned by the same people.
[02:43:40.853 --> 02:43:43.574]  But again, it's all part of getting us used to this period.
[02:43:45.996 --> 02:43:49.117]  On another show, I heard a caller say that the election is on November 9th.
[02:43:49.477 --> 02:43:53.500]  Which I don't think is true, because I think it's listed everywhere as November 2nd.
[02:43:54.020 --> 02:43:59.042]  But if there is any kind of significant event on November 9th, then you know that that will be a target.
[02:43:59.062 --> 02:44:00.123]  Because obviously it's 9-11 to Europeans.
[02:44:02.697 --> 02:44:07.001]  And they're obsessed with tying their misties to this numerical symbolism.
[02:44:07.782 --> 02:44:12.586]  But again, with the election, you'll see a red alert, I think, or at least an orange before the election.
[02:44:12.606 --> 02:44:21.515]  You'll see news anchors poring over how voting is such a courtesy in times of peril, and how the government is so kind to afford us the privilege.
[02:44:21.975 --> 02:44:26.620]  But the question, as you asked, is, you know, if they control voting machines, which we know they do,
[02:44:27.239 --> 02:44:32.721]  And if both Bush and Kerry are behind the same agenda, then why would they need to suspend the election?
[02:44:33.362 --> 02:44:40.725]  And we know from inside sources that there is this fissure within the New World Order which has divided it into at least two camps.
[02:44:41.365 --> 02:44:43.646]  Now, because the end game is the same.
[02:44:43.926 --> 02:44:47.087]  It's just that they disagree on the tactics in which to pursue it.
[02:44:47.668 --> 02:44:55.531]  So we have the kind of globalist camp and then the neocon camp, which is part of the reason why Tenet was forced out, because he was in the globalist camp.
[02:44:56.383 --> 02:45:00.567]  And it's really about, you know, which faction gets its puppet in place to read the teleprompter.
[02:45:00.947 --> 02:45:02.509]  It's the Bush or Kerry.
[02:45:03.029 --> 02:45:10.036]  But with Bilderberg coming out behind Kerry and Edwards, the neocons are obviously running scared that their four years are over.
[02:45:10.717 --> 02:45:19.345]  So, I mean, some of this infighting has gotten dirty, which is why they're making more and more mistakes, and why the neocons are now talking openly about cancelling the election.
[02:45:20.623 --> 02:45:27.427]  But I mean, they're using the overlay, while talking about this, of the Spain bombing on March 11th in Madrid.
[02:45:29.569 --> 02:45:34.772]  And again, that is reinforcing in people's minds the likelihood that this is going to happen.
[02:45:35.232 --> 02:45:41.456]  But of course the individuals who carried out that attack had closer links to the Spanish government than they did to Al-Qaeda.
[02:45:42.476 --> 02:45:49.641]  BBC reported that the man who provided the explosives was in contact with the Spanish security services days before the attack.
[02:45:50.476 --> 02:45:55.041]  And the Boston Globe reported that the Al-Qaeda group blamed for the attack was non-existent.
[02:45:55.641 --> 02:45:56.823]  Well, it's like last week.
[02:45:56.883 --> 02:46:07.213]  For two weeks we were hearing about this Marine beheading, and then, oh, Al-Qaeda claims they cut his head off, and then they go, wait a minute, that got uploaded from Houston, and then it turns out it was a hoax, and then we never hear who hoaxed it.
[02:46:07.834 --> 02:46:13.520]  Well, you'll notice on World Neocon Daily today, there's a big article at the top which, I think it's something like,
[02:46:14.219 --> 02:46:25.528]  Al-Qaeda Terror Navy and it's a story about how a South Korean newspaper reported that an Al-Qaeda group was threatening to attack South Korean ships exporting US goods.
[02:46:26.255 --> 02:46:34.238]  Now, the website that this threat supposedly appeared on had to publish a statement on their front page saying that they were not aware of this.
[02:46:34.378 --> 02:46:39.880]  No group had posted anything on their website which was related to this in any way.
[02:46:40.320 --> 02:46:45.602]  So again, it was a fabricated threat made up from a phony website.
[02:46:45.622 --> 02:46:54.866]  It was like the article of Saddam shipped the weapons out and then it goes, oh, the UN had put tags on sheet metal and wreckage publicly being shipped out to Jordan.
[02:46:55.598 --> 02:46:59.501]  I mean, but they all looked at the headlines and said, weapons of mass destruction found!
[02:47:00.802 --> 02:47:02.984]  Yeah, I mean, I see examples of that every day.
[02:47:03.044 --> 02:47:06.486]  Again, with the recent, the beheading of the South Korean.
[02:47:06.506 --> 02:47:10.650]  I mean, the US government knew about that days before they even told the South Korean government.
[02:47:11.250 --> 02:47:18.135]  It turns out that this latest threat of beheading, where the Marine was later released, that turned out to be a hoax.
[02:47:18.275 --> 02:47:19.576]  I mean, they're all hoaxes.
[02:47:20.097 --> 02:47:21.538]  But back to the election.
[02:47:22.483 --> 02:47:27.166]  Again, it doesn't matter who wins, because if Kerry gets in, you'll see the same amount of wars.
[02:47:27.286 --> 02:47:29.947]  They just won't be about, you know, weapons of mass destruction.
[02:47:29.987 --> 02:47:32.368]  They'll be about humanitarian crisis.
[02:47:32.548 --> 02:47:33.409]  And here's another one!
[02:47:33.962 --> 02:47:40.665]  The report in Newsweek Magazine about suspending the election confirmed Monday says the discussions were spurred by a letter from U.S.
[02:47:40.705 --> 02:47:46.648]  Election Assistance Commission, created by Bush, Chairman DeForest Soares.
[02:47:46.809 --> 02:47:54.172]  Now, this is their creative board saying that this needs to happen, that they need to have plans for this to happen.
[02:47:54.212 --> 02:47:57.254]  I mean, how much more obvious does it have to get, folks?
[02:47:59.269 --> 02:48:08.655]  But again, in so announcing it, you know, so publicly, months before the event, do you think that, you know, they will then go ahead and launch this attack on election day?
[02:48:08.695 --> 02:48:15.280]  Because I think that is making it a bit too obvious, almost as obvious as the bombing in Tel Aviv over the weekend where
[02:48:15.879 --> 02:48:25.921]  And I mean, I don't agree with the UN or Israel on this, but Israel were told to take the wall down, and the day after, a massive bombing took place, which Israel blamed on, you know, the Palestinians.
[02:48:25.941 --> 02:48:27.742]  I mean, is it becoming as obvious as that?
[02:48:27.802 --> 02:48:28.162]  I don't know.
[02:48:28.482 --> 02:48:32.143]  And the UN was running around with Arafat, saying Israel did it.
[02:48:33.443 --> 02:48:34.404]  Yeah, exactly so.
[02:48:34.804 --> 02:48:37.384]  I mean, will it be as obvious as that on election day?
[02:48:38.245 --> 02:48:43.546]  Alright folks, final segment, a few key news items straight ahead, you'll want to stay the course with us, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:48:45.521 --> 02:48:49.869]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.050 --> 02:48:54.398]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:56.394 --> 02:48:58.996]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.036 --> 02:49:01.959]  The New World Order can emerge.
[02:49:02.179 --> 02:49:06.383]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.463 --> 02:49:13.389]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.529 --> 02:49:15.531]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:15.771 --> 02:49:26.337]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.517 --> 02:49:31.880]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:49:44.947 --> 02:49:51.168]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:49:51.308 --> 02:49:57.469]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:49:57.749 --> 02:50:06.191]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:50:06.431 --> 02:50:13.452]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:50:13.772 --> 02:50:18.595]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:50:18.815 --> 02:50:24.199]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:50:24.559 --> 02:50:27.621]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:50:27.962 --> 02:50:35.967]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:52:04.225 --> 02:52:10.566]  When the love of a lie finally falls, the new world order will pay.
[02:52:11.747 --> 02:52:15.067]  Paul Watson, Red Cross fears U.S.
[02:52:15.127 --> 02:52:16.248]  is hiding detainees AP.
[02:52:16.288 --> 02:52:19.888]  The International Red Cross said today that it fears U.S.
[02:52:20.008 --> 02:52:22.849]  officials are holding terror suspects secretly in locations around the world.
[02:52:23.655 --> 02:52:31.458]  Well, Paul, I mean, years ago the CIA bragged they were taking them to Jordan and to Egypt to torture them and quote their children.
[02:52:31.878 --> 02:52:36.300]  Can we post that Washington Post article and others from two years ago in this article?
[02:52:36.340 --> 02:52:37.641]  I mean, your comments.
[02:52:38.761 --> 02:52:42.923]  Yeah, I remember those articles, and I still see articles every day.
[02:52:42.963 --> 02:52:46.684]  We were talking earlier about even we kind of gloss over issues.
[02:52:47.324 --> 02:52:48.645]  I see articles every day.
[02:52:49.150 --> 02:52:53.433]  Where there are new cases of torture, or abuse, or pressure.
[02:52:53.953 --> 02:52:59.497]  Where people are both shipped out to other countries and, you know, places in Iraq which we haven't discovered yet.
[02:52:59.517 --> 02:53:02.098]  And I kind of sometimes gloss over those as well.
[02:53:02.138 --> 02:53:04.460]  And it doesn't get major headlines of the average person.
[02:53:04.480 --> 02:53:09.563]  You know, more reports of killing women and children, and torturing them, and doing other horrible things.
[02:53:10.604 --> 02:53:13.926]  Other issues, something that's encouraging, this is out of the Associated Press,
[02:53:14.875 --> 02:53:39.999]  Jadakiss, and I don't really like hip-hop folks, but it's the number one thing right now, and he has the number one single in the country, where he says, Why Did Bush Knock Down the Towers, a song called Why, Why Did Bush Knock Down the Towers, and then he gets into more about, you know, how they're using it to take over, and he said, Hey, people in New York, this is what everybody thinks is going on, everybody I've talked to, I just told people what we think in New York,
[02:53:40.640 --> 02:53:43.201]  That's gotta scare them on even popular culture.
[02:53:43.261 --> 02:53:47.322]  The number one song in the country says, why did Bush knock down the towers, Paul?
[02:53:48.343 --> 02:53:58.946]  Well, yeah, from what I've seen, from the people that email me on this, there are like two factions of hip-hop, one of which is promoted by MTV, which is the, you know, the thug version of hip-hop, glorifying
[02:53:59.800 --> 02:54:25.613]  uh... criminality but then there's another version which is more intelligent which obviously doesn't get as much uh... exposure which is political and we we've got Paris who is someone else who talks about this kind of thing but wasn't it interesting how the video uh... which MTV received the exact segment where this lyric is included was taken out of the video and they were ignorant to who did it yeah right and it says radio stations are getting edited versions too
[02:54:26.393 --> 02:54:32.616]  Yes, I mean, who is sending out the edited versions if the original producer of it, you know, isn't doing that?
[02:54:32.636 --> 02:54:34.937]  Okay, final piece of news, this is out of the AP.
[02:54:34.997 --> 02:54:44.361]  Group wants Maryland elections chief to quit over electronic voting machine fraud and 10,000 signatures calling for a voting system that produces paper recounts.
[02:54:44.782 --> 02:54:49.804]  Now that's some good news, and that's going on right here in Austin right now too, not just in Baltimore, Maryland.
[02:54:50.444 --> 02:54:54.206]  Paul, here in the last minute or so, PrisonPlanet.tv, tell folks about it.
[02:54:55.450 --> 02:55:03.161]  Well yeah, we've just posted the interview yesterday from David Icke, as we do with every interview on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:55:03.782 --> 02:55:10.712]  Weekly television reports, which Alex films in Austin, and on top of that documentaries from other documentary filmmakers.
[02:55:11.532 --> 02:55:18.118]  There were a couple of issues with smaller browsers like Mozilla browser, which I fixed over the weekend, so it's all running smoothly now.
[02:55:18.698 --> 02:55:20.860]  And it's $5.95 a month.
[02:55:21.200 --> 02:55:23.282]  It's $54.95 for a whole year.
[02:55:23.442 --> 02:55:27.505]  We've already got dozens of videos and, you know, hundreds of audios on there.
[02:55:27.866 --> 02:55:30.828]  So it's great value for money and it's expanding every day.
[02:55:31.549 --> 02:55:36.352]  Both our books, all my videos, other great films, PrisonPlanet.tv.
