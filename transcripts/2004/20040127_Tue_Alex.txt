[00:00:05.553 --> 00:00:06.194]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.854 --> 00:00:07.915]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.636 --> 00:00:09.757]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.397 --> 00:00:11.218]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:12.879]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.203]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.703 --> 00:00:21.847]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.473]  My friends, it is already...
[00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.370]  Tuesday, the 27th of January, 2004.
[00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:45.194]  And I hope that you're going to strap yourselves in because I've never seen so much out in the open corruption.
[00:00:45.554 --> 00:00:50.195]  Dismantling of America and the world into a high-tech police state.
[00:00:51.556 --> 00:00:52.916]  So strap yourselves in.
[00:00:53.836 --> 00:00:56.077]  Bird flu outbreak is deadliest on record.
[00:00:56.097 --> 00:00:56.777]  We'll get into that.
[00:00:57.297 --> 00:00:59.398]  Big headline out of the Associated Press.
[00:01:00.652 --> 00:01:05.334]  Retailers look to finger scans, get ready to thumb scan to buy and sell.
[00:01:05.354 --> 00:01:08.475]  Made my first film about this in 97.
[00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:14.037]  I've seen the federal documents, but here it is in the Associated Press carrying the Sacramento Bee.
[00:01:14.801 --> 00:01:17.483]  Global unemployment at record high.
[00:01:17.683 --> 00:01:21.645]  Nuclear war danger highest ever, UN weapons chief says.
[00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:25.327]  Republican lawmakers won't back Bush on immigration.
[00:01:25.367 --> 00:01:26.208]  Some good news.
[00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:27.729]  Gotta keep the heat on them.
[00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:32.692]  Expect them to pass it on some midnight evening and then claim that they didn't know what they were voting for.
[00:01:33.312 --> 00:01:34.193]  But good news there.
[00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:37.655]  Part of Patriot Act ruled unconstitutional.
[00:01:39.016 --> 00:01:39.856]  By a judge.
[00:01:40.017 --> 00:01:41.117]  We'll see if that sticks.
[00:01:41.197 --> 00:01:42.118]  More good news.
[00:01:42.278 --> 00:01:45.359]  Three doctors dispute how Dr. David Kelly died.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.222]  Folks in the government are saying he was obviously murdered, but he didn't commit suicide.
[00:01:50.282 --> 00:01:50.762]  No kidding.
[00:01:51.803 --> 00:01:55.004]  Again, headline, Dr. Kelly did not kill himself.
[00:01:55.464 --> 00:01:56.605]  Leaked news memos.
[00:01:56.665 --> 00:01:58.886]  Election 04 to be stolen again.
[00:01:59.306 --> 00:02:03.769]  Media to interview actors posing as troops on how great the war was.
[00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:05.690]  Now, two months ago,
[00:02:06.784 --> 00:02:17.447]  When the Queen of England went to Nigeria they used a soap opera set in the country in a fake village and didn't announce it until after that when they got caught that it was staged.
[00:02:18.291 --> 00:02:25.032]  Remember, the Pentagon has been caught planting hundreds of fake letters from troops in newspapers across the country with false signatures.
[00:02:25.532 --> 00:02:28.993]  I wouldn't put it past them, and these folks with these leaked memos have been accurate in the past.
[00:02:29.993 --> 00:02:35.414]  Dean, who I've never liked, I don't like John Kerry, I don't like George Bush, they're all globalists, folks.
[00:02:35.454 --> 00:02:36.694]  That's a selection process.
[00:02:37.175 --> 00:02:44.196]  He called for a microchip ID card, so we'll get into that in the New Hampshire primary taking place right now.
[00:02:45.796 --> 00:02:47.357]  We'll get into rumblings from Rummy.
[00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:54.821]  The battle plans to invade Syria and Lebanon are next, and Dean says he's closing fast on Kerry, accuses rivals of dirty tricks.
[00:02:55.602 --> 00:02:58.744]  A story I didn't get to yesterday that I should have that we will detail.
[00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:07.613]  Is it conspiracy or coincidence that there's a long and tangled history between the Bush family and the elite of Saudi Arabia, including the bin Ladens?
[00:03:08.034 --> 00:03:11.416]  This out of the CBC Fifth Estate Program.
[00:03:11.916 --> 00:03:16.138]  Also, Financial Times reporting top 9-11 suspect was granted U.S.
[00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.759]  visa.
[00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:21.323]  Skull and Bones denying it's right.
[00:03:22.144 --> 00:03:23.786]  Suckers AOL Time Warner.
[00:03:24.267 --> 00:03:25.909]  This is out of the New York Observer.
[00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:36.583]  Some of Skull and Bones' dirty tricks against the New York Observer since they broke the news of the, we've talked about it for years, but mainstream news broke it two years ago with the satanic rituals they caught on tape.
[00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:38.978]  Illegal immigration in the U.S.
[00:03:39.038 --> 00:03:42.039]  grew by nearly 70% in the last 12 years.
[00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.300]  Criminal aliens abound in the U.S.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.440]  We'll give you the numbers on that.
[00:03:45.841 --> 00:03:52.283]  Chiefs of Police Border Security, a sham organization, claims wax federal policies causing the murder of cops.
[00:03:52.824 --> 00:03:55.785]  Oh yeah, it's these illegals are the biggest group of cop killers out there.
[00:03:56.225 --> 00:03:56.966]  But that's okay.
[00:03:56.986 --> 00:04:01.628]  You'll arrest good patriotic Americans when they arrest illegals on their own property.
[00:04:01.868 --> 00:04:02.188]  Cops.
[00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:06.371]  New federal detention center planned for South Texas.
[00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:10.013]  Planned Parenthood moves to shut pro-life firms successfully.
[00:04:10.974 --> 00:04:13.436]  Border Patrol agents slam alien amnesty.
[00:04:13.996 --> 00:04:18.980]  And there's a New York Post article where they did a little test of eating nothing but McDonald's for a month.
[00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:24.043]  And people who were completely healthy became deathly ill.
[00:04:24.924 --> 00:04:26.785]  We'll be going over that.
[00:04:27.165 --> 00:04:29.387]  Ashcroft, war justified even without...
[00:04:30.205 --> 00:04:31.486]  Weapons of mass destruction.
[00:04:32.086 --> 00:04:33.867]  That's about a third of what I got in front of me.
[00:04:33.887 --> 00:04:34.988]  We'll detail it all.
[00:04:35.068 --> 00:04:36.009]  Take your calls.
[00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:39.611]  Big show lined up for you on this Tuesday.

[00:05:00.962 --> 00:05:03.203]  Hey boys, Valentine's Day is coming.

[00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:30.082]  The anticipation grows as everyone tries to guess who the lucky recipient is.
[00:05:30.442 --> 00:05:33.903]  And the joy and pride when the flowers are placed on her desk.

[00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:11.104]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:06:11.284 --> 00:06:18.827]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:19.108 --> 00:06:22.249]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.810]  We're good to go.
[00:06:41.092 --> 00:06:47.016]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.

[00:06:59.104 --> 00:07:04.428]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:07:04.608 --> 00:07:09.051]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:09.191 --> 00:07:10.432]  There is a chance.
[00:07:10.932 --> 00:07:13.554]  To use this disaster for a new world order.
[00:07:13.654 --> 00:07:16.376]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:20.959]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:21.019 --> 00:07:27.943]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:28.064 --> 00:07:30.085]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:40.790]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.

[00:08:05.316 --> 00:08:05.977]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.637 --> 00:08:07.717]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.397 --> 00:08:09.517]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.157 --> 00:08:10.978]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.738 --> 00:08:12.638]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:16.959]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.479 --> 00:08:21.600]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.241]  Again, my friends, it is Tuesday, the 27th day of this first month in 04.
[00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:31.722]  I'm Alex Jones, your host...
[00:08:32.768 --> 00:08:44.354]  You'd like to read along with us as we cover the legislation, the bills, the documents, the news articles, visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or our backup site, Infowars.net.
[00:08:46.395 --> 00:08:47.015]  Oh my goodness!
[00:08:47.868 --> 00:08:50.050]  I have quite a task before me today.
[00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.911]  I wanted to get into the Walton family.
[00:08:52.312 --> 00:08:54.513]  The world's wealthiest family is the headline.
[00:08:54.533 --> 00:09:03.720]  That's actually not true, but they're one of the richest new money families out there with worth well over $100 billion.
[00:09:03.841 --> 00:09:08.644]  So we'll be getting into that story.
[00:09:10.926 --> 00:09:15.730]  This bird flu situation, outbreak, is the deadliest on record, they're saying.
[00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:21.873]  Every few years, there's some new bird flu, and they kill all the geese or the chickens, or most of them.
[00:09:22.373 --> 00:09:25.175]  Bird flu hits eighth country.
[00:09:25.395 --> 00:09:29.978]  Laos outbreak is deadly as ever, with death of second Thai boy.
[00:09:30.778 --> 00:09:44.627]  Bangkok, Thailand confirmed Asia's eighth human victim of the bird flu Tuesday, and the deadliest outbreak on record, while a map of the affected areas widened, with Laos becoming the ninth government to report infections in its poultry.
[00:09:45.718 --> 00:09:53.903]  Australia, which remains free of the virus, urged other countries to immediately reveal bird flu cases following allegations that Thailand and Indonesia initially covered up outbreaks.
[00:09:55.444 --> 00:10:02.008]  Countries in the region must learn from the SARS experience, and that is, fess up as soon as you find a case as quickly as possible.
[00:10:02.408 --> 00:10:11.074]  Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer told Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio, make sure everybody knows it is there and how to deal with it.
[00:10:12.884 --> 00:10:17.290]  Well, folks, I mean, we have an average of 35,000 flu deaths a year in this country.
[00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.773]  That's just the normal strains.
[00:10:19.853 --> 00:10:25.981]  And all these strains, all the modern strains, going back to World War I, come out of Asia.
[00:10:53.325 --> 00:10:57.126]  Wake up, boys, there's a light at the window.
[00:10:57.146 --> 00:11:02.529]  I can hear someone knocking on the door.
[00:11:04.269 --> 00:11:08.891]  There are voices in the street and the sound of running feet.
[00:11:09.671 --> 00:11:12.652]  And they whisper the word, revolution.
[00:11:14.913 --> 00:11:18.995]  There are men coming down from the valleys.
[00:11:20.743 --> 00:11:47.538]  There are tall ships flying off the coast And they carry the light in the dark of the night Like a whisper in the wind Bring my gun and a handful of silver By the sea we will gather for the fight
[00:11:49.993 --> 00:12:05.465]  It's been so many years So many tears We have lost once before Now we'll sell the score When our cannons will roar Revolution!
[00:12:26.292 --> 00:12:28.673]  Watch and wait, get ready for the sign.
[00:12:29.053 --> 00:12:32.575]  There are many here among us now who have not seen the light.
[00:12:32.995 --> 00:12:36.616]  We must say the word to all people in the land.
[00:12:37.016 --> 00:12:40.858]  Go to every hill and mountain, for the time is now at hand.
[00:13:03.696 --> 00:13:06.218]  That's right, my friends.
[00:13:06.238 --> 00:13:13.163]  For the years of domination hit them right between the eyes and light a fire.
[00:13:26.912 --> 00:13:27.754]  Welcome back.
[00:13:27.895 --> 00:13:32.807]  Let's try to continue here with my connection from Austin, Texas to Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[00:13:32.847 --> 00:13:35.213]  There are the satellites orbiting the globe.
[00:13:36.016 --> 00:13:39.639]  Out to the AM and FM stations, Internet, shortwave, you name it.
[00:13:39.939 --> 00:13:49.948]  By the way, we're on global shortwave Monday through Friday from 11 to 2, Central at 12.172 and 93.20, and back from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 68.90.
[00:13:50.048 --> 00:13:53.931]  I get emails every day asking what shortwave frequencies we're on.
[00:13:54.352 --> 00:13:58.195]  Those are all listed for all the shows at GCMLive.com as well.
[00:13:58.635 --> 00:14:01.358]  But bird flu outbreak is deadliest on record.
[00:14:02.964 --> 00:14:04.985]  And why suddenly do we see all this showing up?
[00:14:05.205 --> 00:14:06.806]  And why are they fear-mongering?
[00:14:08.127 --> 00:14:12.349]  It's obviously serious, and it's killing people, and it's a deadly strain of flu.
[00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:26.876]  But the reason we see the flu is always coming out of Asia is because they'll have tens of thousands of pigs in pens on these giant hog farms right next to thousands and thousands of geese and chickens.
[00:14:27.908 --> 00:14:30.130]  And they've done the studies.
[00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:42.899]  They've known for 50 years it's because the manure of the different species combine together and becomes like giant petri dishes where different types of flu viruses mutate and merge together.
[00:14:43.639 --> 00:14:44.800]  And that's where it's all coming from.
[00:14:45.524 --> 00:14:50.747]  And the Asians aren't about to stop this unhealthy practice they've been engaging in for thousands of years.
[00:14:50.807 --> 00:15:04.333]  And now here in the Western world, we imitate it with our hog farms and feedlots and the big chicken production plants where they cut the beaks off the chickens and put them in tiny cages.
[00:15:04.413 --> 00:15:06.174]  And you know why they cut the beaks off the chickens?
[00:15:06.194 --> 00:15:07.855]  So they don't commit suicide.
[00:15:07.875 --> 00:15:08.755]  They're so unhappy.
[00:15:08.775 --> 00:15:14.518]  They literally heck themselves and others through the cage mesh to death.
[00:15:15.746 --> 00:15:16.666]  And it's unhealthy.
[00:15:16.906 --> 00:15:19.267]  I mean, I'd rather pay more for good food, wouldn't you?
[00:15:19.347 --> 00:15:20.647]  But no, they're not going to stop.
[00:15:21.167 --> 00:15:45.032]  Big Pharma, Big Agriculture, Big Biotech sets up this system, then it creates the mad cow and the rest of it, they feed antibiotics to the chickens, causes all these new super-resistant strains of bacteria, and then they come in with federal regulations and regulate the small farms and ranches out of existence, and then all you have is Big Agriculture owned by Big Pharma and Big Biotech.
[00:15:46.052 --> 00:15:47.653]  That's what I have to say about the bird flu.
[00:15:48.353 --> 00:15:50.514]  We'll watch it as it develops.
[00:15:50.634 --> 00:15:50.934]  Okay.
[00:15:51.934 --> 00:15:54.596]  Retailers look to finger scans.
[00:15:54.656 --> 00:15:58.617]  This is how the AP was also posted in the Sacramento Bee.
[00:15:59.618 --> 00:16:01.698]  Allison Roberts wrote the story.
[00:16:02.659 --> 00:16:05.240]  Retailers look to finger scans.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.742]  Checking IDs could get more reliable with biometric tools.
[00:16:11.058 --> 00:16:24.994]  Biometric devices which confirm identification by measuring biological or behavioral features, how you walk, how you talk, your face, your thumb, your hand, have been a staple of police work in science fiction movies for decades.
[00:16:25.375 --> 00:16:30.540]  Now they're moving into the everyday world of airports, workplaces, and corner markets.
[00:16:31.141 --> 00:16:47.765]  In the Sacramento area, finger scan identification systems are showing up in growing numbers of check cashing windows, many with grocery stores, and in the future, expect to see them at cash registers allowing customers to pay for food and goods as well, no ATM card or wallet needed.
[00:16:49.205 --> 00:16:53.466]  And then if you're not a good globalist, they just turn your national ID card number off.
[00:16:54.166 --> 00:16:55.846]  And what is your national ID card?
[00:16:56.206 --> 00:16:59.447]  In 42 states, and the other eight are signing on as we speak,
[00:17:00.518 --> 00:17:01.919]  I haven't checked it out in the last few months.
[00:17:01.959 --> 00:17:03.901]  I know it was 42 about six months ago.
[00:17:03.961 --> 00:17:04.421]  I need to look.
[00:17:04.461 --> 00:17:06.763]  I think a few other states have actually signed on to that.
[00:17:08.364 --> 00:17:17.051]  Your driver's license is federally mandated with federal biometric systems hooked into what you know as the matrix system that, again, is in 42 states, not seven states.
[00:17:18.091 --> 00:17:24.556]  And that's all part of the National Security Agency, and its real program name is Echelon.
[00:17:25.537 --> 00:17:26.478]  Echelon.
[00:17:28.112 --> 00:17:30.473]  So, I just thought I would mention that.
[00:17:30.514 --> 00:17:33.235]  And they go on to say, we'll all be using this to buy and sell.
[00:17:33.255 --> 00:17:36.737]  This is going to replace credit cards and just get used to it.
[00:17:37.638 --> 00:17:40.259]  And let me tell you how this is going to work in about 60 seconds.
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.442]  In the next two years, they're going to come out with a national sales tax.
[00:17:45.483 --> 00:17:51.006]  Neocon traders will advertise this as a way to replace the income tax, which I'm no fan of, which is criminal.
[00:17:52.282 --> 00:17:54.663]  An unconstitutional, 60th Amendment was never ratified.
[00:17:55.343 --> 00:18:00.144]  They will come in and they will keep the income tax for, quote, Social Security at 14 to 16 percent.
[00:18:00.404 --> 00:18:03.385]  They'll then ratchet that up after they put in the sales tax.
[00:18:04.045 --> 00:18:09.047]  The national sales tax will be shared with the county and the city and the state, bringing them under federal control.
[00:18:09.247 --> 00:18:14.068]  All businesses will have this in place, and you will have to swipe your card to do it.
[00:18:14.867 --> 00:18:21.612]  To, quote, take out the taxes, to make sure it's all properly paid and divided amongst the county, the city, the state, and the feds, and the internationals.
[00:18:21.632 --> 00:18:23.053]  They're going to get a portion of it.
[00:18:23.573 --> 00:18:24.614]  It's part of the Tobin tax.
[00:18:24.814 --> 00:18:25.895]  This is publicly announced.
[00:18:26.655 --> 00:18:28.296]  And you will have to swipe your card.
[00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:37.963]  And then they're going to have problems with cards being stolen, so they're going to make you thumb scan or retina scan or face scan or all three to activate your card.
[00:18:38.223 --> 00:18:42.266]  Then they'll say, oh, don't worry, you don't have to use the card, just thumbprint.
[00:18:43.171 --> 00:18:46.239]  Five years ago, they began putting thumb scanners in public schools.
[00:18:46.359 --> 00:18:48.324]  No cash allowed if you want your school lunch.
[00:18:48.604 --> 00:18:49.487]  You must thumbprint.
[00:18:50.834 --> 00:18:54.056]  And this is under a federal mandate, federally funding that that happened.
[00:18:54.116 --> 00:18:59.080]  It's now in thousands of school districts since the first school districts we learned of in Texas.
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.322]  It is now in almost all 50 states that we know of.
[00:19:02.382 --> 00:19:08.326]  Again, I see articles every day about thumb scanners going in the schools, and the public plan is to do this.
[00:19:08.366 --> 00:19:17.132]  They will put in the self-serve checkout lanes, which are now replacing almost all the service lanes everywhere, from Walmart to most grocery store chains, to Target.
[00:19:18.348 --> 00:19:19.469]  You name it, it's happening.
[00:19:19.949 --> 00:19:27.917]  Even smaller sporting goods stores, they will then replace all the checkout lanes you will have to bag your groceries and thumb scan to buy and sell.
[00:19:28.817 --> 00:19:38.306]  This is the new system, and we're about two years away from not being able to buy or sell if our human biometric code system does not go through.
[00:19:39.386 --> 00:19:43.029]  And you say, oh, this will stop crime, this will stop identity fraud, all of this.
[00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:53.599]  Folks, you have to remember how criminal this government is, what they've been caught doing, and the precedence they're setting, where if you haven't paid your parking tickets, they come take your car, you can't renew your driver's license.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.003]  Walmart, by the way, well, I've got more news on this.
[00:19:57.303 --> 00:19:58.064]  Very scary.
[00:19:58.284 --> 00:19:59.325]  We'll come back and get to more news.
[00:20:01.107 --> 00:20:04.689]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:08.551]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[00:20:08.831 --> 00:20:17.675]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial specialists with decades of financial experience who are ready to provide you with state-of-the-art, up-to-date financial services.
[00:20:18.016 --> 00:20:21.958]  Midas Resources offers a host of services and stands behind their products.
[00:20:22.238 --> 00:20:26.480]  In fact, if you call and order their free Midas Report, Midas Resources will pay you.
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.981]  And remember, if you read the Midas Report, you'll receive a free Walking Liberty Silver Half Dollar.
[00:21:00.933 --> 00:21:02.633]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:21:02.713 --> 00:21:05.234]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[00:21:05.395 --> 00:21:06.095]  It feels great.
[00:21:06.275 --> 00:21:07.295]  Absolutely wonderful.
[00:21:07.415 --> 00:21:12.938]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:21:13.258 --> 00:21:14.778]  Kimberly, tell us about your success.
[00:21:15.079 --> 00:21:17.419]  Okay, I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.721]  I've lost 16 pounds, and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[00:21:20.841 --> 00:21:21.521]  Incredible.
[00:21:21.721 --> 00:21:22.942]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[00:21:22.962 --> 00:21:26.663]  I have a 21-month-old child, and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[00:21:26.683 --> 00:21:27.564]  Well, that's for sure.
[00:21:27.724 --> 00:21:28.264]  Was it easy?
[00:21:28.524 --> 00:21:29.124]  Very easy.
[00:21:29.184 --> 00:21:30.065]  I mean, there's nothing to it.
[00:21:30.085 --> 00:21:35.267]  You can actually still continue to eat meals with your children and not starve yourself or anything else and lose weight.
[00:21:35.487 --> 00:21:41.770]  I know you can lose fat the safe and healthy way, just like Kimberly did with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:43.171]  Call right now, 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:21:43.191 --> 00:21:43.471]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:21:48.553 --> 00:21:53.456]  Remember, mention you heard it right here and that gets you $25 off a three-month supply.
[00:21:53.676 --> 00:21:54.897]  So call Vim and Vigor today.
[00:21:54.917 --> 00:21:55.117]  1-800-622-THIN.
[00:21:55.137 --> 00:21:55.597]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:22:00.894 --> 00:22:04.795]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:22:05.035 --> 00:22:10.456]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:22:10.736 --> 00:22:21.098]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:22:21.258 --> 00:22:25.599]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:22:25.799 --> 00:22:29.360]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.301]  We're good to go.
[00:23:01.579 --> 00:23:03.640]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.461]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot.
[00:23:05.581 --> 00:23:13.565]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[00:23:13.825 --> 00:23:20.268]  Imagine hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini, followed by peaches, mixed fruit, or pineapple for dessert.
[00:23:20.428 --> 00:23:21.689]  Just a few of the many selections.
[00:23:21.869 --> 00:23:22.949]  We're good to go.
[00:23:38.055 --> 00:23:38.775]  We're good to go.
[00:24:08.411 --> 00:24:15.536]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment, Chris and Dave and Charles and Garen and others.
[00:24:16.917 --> 00:24:19.078]  Let me launch back into news right now.
[00:24:20.139 --> 00:24:25.142]  And again, I'm just going to skim over these and get more into detail as the show progresses.
[00:24:25.543 --> 00:24:27.664]  Global unemployment at record high.
[00:24:27.704 --> 00:24:33.508]  More than 185 million people were jobless in 2003 as global unemployment levels hit record highs.
[00:24:35.379 --> 00:24:37.701]  I talked to a lady who works at a mortgage firm.
[00:24:37.741 --> 00:24:40.303]  They were doing hundreds and hundreds a month.
[00:24:40.583 --> 00:24:42.064]  This is a little small mortgage house.
[00:24:42.645 --> 00:24:44.686]  Now they've done four in the last month.
[00:24:45.687 --> 00:24:46.608]  Give you an idea there.
[00:24:46.628 --> 00:24:51.612]  Nuclear war danger, highest ever, UN's nuclear chief.
[00:24:53.793 --> 00:25:02.740]  Yeah, with our own government helping arm these supposed rogue countries.
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.922]  The good news, Republican lawmakers won't back Bush on immigration.
[00:25:07.223 --> 00:25:11.546]  Republican lawmakers who generally back President Bush are not backing him on immigration.
[00:25:11.586 --> 00:25:17.590]  In fact, they want their leaders to know they have serious concerns about President Bush's proposed immigration policy.
[00:25:18.266 --> 00:25:22.587]  Now, just two weeks ago, they were saying they liked it, but now because of the heat you've put on them, they're having to back off.
[00:25:22.927 --> 00:25:35.409]  In a letter addressed to House Speaker Dennis Hassell, Representative Walter Jones, Republican North Carolina, and several other members of the Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus said they won't go along with the President's plan because it does not address the problem appropriately.
[00:25:35.549 --> 00:25:36.289]  Appropriately?
[00:25:36.329 --> 00:25:38.049]  Like Bush is fixing something?
[00:25:38.289 --> 00:25:44.511]  This is blanket, total, in perpetuity amnesty for six years, and then it gets re-upped from there.
[00:25:45.611 --> 00:25:46.711]  Here's some more good news.
[00:25:47.699 --> 00:25:49.841]  Problem is, the White House just ignores courts.
[00:25:50.442 --> 00:25:57.510]  Part of Patriot Act ruled unconstitutional, ban on giving expert advice or assistance to foreign terror groups called too vague.
[00:25:58.351 --> 00:26:07.661]  Yeah, the way it's written is, if you sell gasoline to a suspected terrorist at the gas station, you can be secretly arrested.
[00:26:08.854 --> 00:26:13.718]  If you sell them a cell phone because you run a little cell phone business.
[00:26:14.058 --> 00:26:15.759]  I mean, everything's an act of terror.
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:25.786]  And remember, the definition of a terrorist and a foreign power is any action that endangers human life that is a violation of any law of any state or the federal government.
[00:26:26.307 --> 00:26:27.908]  So it's so broad, everything's terrorism.
[00:26:28.508 --> 00:26:34.590]  And again, prosecutors down in Florida say they want a guilty plea from Limbaugh.
[00:26:35.291 --> 00:26:42.173]  They're going to go ahead and probably indict him, and they use the Patriot Act, a provision of it, to get his medical records, folks.
[00:26:43.174 --> 00:26:47.175]  Because under drug trafficking, they say that's an act of terror.
[00:26:48.296 --> 00:26:49.556]  Is Rush Limbaugh a terrorist?
[00:26:49.716 --> 00:26:49.956]  No.
[00:26:51.117 --> 00:26:52.197]  Are these topless bars?
[00:26:52.257 --> 00:26:54.838]  Are these county commissioners and bedridden terrorists?
[00:26:56.019 --> 00:26:56.159]  No.
[00:26:57.066 --> 00:26:58.326]  They're obviously criminals.
[00:26:59.106 --> 00:27:01.407]  By the way, I've heard Limbaugh say, you know, put all these...
[00:27:29.355 --> 00:27:30.536]  Sorry, folks.
[00:27:31.577 --> 00:27:33.518]  We've had so many people trying to diagnose this.
[00:27:33.578 --> 00:27:36.239]  It's amazing, but it seems to happen once or twice a week.
[00:27:36.359 --> 00:27:37.120]  Never used to happen.
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:40.602]  We'll keep rolling with the punches here, my friends.
[00:27:42.603 --> 00:27:46.185]  I was continuing with the Patriot Act discussion.
[00:27:48.704 --> 00:27:57.031]  And a federal judge has struck down a section of the USA Patriot Act that makes it a crime to give expert advice or assistance to foreign terrorist organizations.
[00:27:57.051 --> 00:28:00.994]  The first ruling to declare any portion of the Patriot Act unconstitutional.
[00:28:01.514 --> 00:28:01.634]  U.S.
[00:28:01.654 --> 00:28:16.606]  District Judge Audrey Collins of Los Angeles said the ban was so vague that Americans would be uncertain about whether they could give the most benign advice to a foreign organization, for example, on how to follow the law without risking prosecution.
[00:28:18.018 --> 00:28:45.005]  And we covered the 60 Minutes piece, arming our enemies, funding our enemies yesterday, where it's Halliburton and Bechtel and a handful of others who are actually selling the weapons and infrastructure components to Libya, to Iraq, to Iran, to Syria, and through the sanctions they've gotten set up, no one else is allowed to sell to these people but those supposedly waging the war on terror.
[00:28:45.065 --> 00:28:46.265]  What a great system.
[00:28:47.199 --> 00:28:48.900]  Well, that's what this whole New World Order is about.
[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:50.021]  It's not free market.
[00:28:50.401 --> 00:29:01.268]  It's crony capitalism where you use government power to go after your competition, to restrict the middle class, and to set up systems where third world countries can only buy from them.
[00:29:02.649 --> 00:29:03.930]  And that's exactly what's happening.
[00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:14.577]  But with this ruling on part of the Patriot Act, expect to see that be appealed, even if a federal circuit court, even if a conservative court or a liberal court
[00:29:15.285 --> 00:29:16.126]  We're good to go.
[00:29:35.055 --> 00:29:38.497]  Against the Patriot Act, and I challenge you to read it for yourself.
[00:29:38.898 --> 00:29:40.179]  It is the death of America.
[00:29:40.699 --> 00:29:42.520]  It is totally un-American.
[00:29:43.001 --> 00:29:45.642]  Well, come back, go to your calls, get you a ton of other news.
[00:29:46.143 --> 00:29:49.645]  Believe me, it's very important you stay with us.
[00:29:51.346 --> 00:29:52.327]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.727 --> 00:29:54.368]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.388 --> 00:29:57.931]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.258 --> 00:30:04.240]  You are sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:10.123]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw food.
[00:30:10.283 --> 00:30:11.644]  You haven't alkalized your body.
[00:30:11.804 --> 00:30:15.806]  In fact, you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[00:30:16.007 --> 00:30:21.810]  You still use either meat, fish, eggs, and or dairy products for your protein instead of spirulina and chlorella.
[00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:24.591]  The two most complete protein superfoods known.
[00:30:24.931 --> 00:30:27.412]  Finally, you don't consume ionized water.
[00:30:27.732 --> 00:30:34.855]  Normal tap water that is transformed into a powerful antioxidant that is very alkaline, balancing your body pH as it brings you to homeostasis.
[00:30:35.175 --> 00:30:38.816]  It's also very hydrating and, more importantly, extremely detoxifying.
[00:30:38.936 --> 00:30:39.456]  www.watershed.net
[00:31:02.935 --> 00:31:07.956]  Late summer 2003, mainstream press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[00:31:08.357 --> 00:31:11.097]  Late summer 2002, I heard the same thing.
[00:31:11.537 --> 00:31:14.418]  Late summer 2001, you heard the same thing.
[00:31:14.798 --> 00:31:21.920]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently trading in the 93 to 9400 range, is down 7% from two years ago.
[00:31:22.441 --> 00:31:23.341]  That's recovery?
[00:31:23.941 --> 00:31:29.142]  Gold, now trading in the $360 range, is up 31% in that same period.
[00:31:29.543 --> 00:31:31.083]  Where do you want your hard-earned money?
[00:31:31.775 --> 00:31:34.516]  Hi folks, this is Jack Brown with Midas Resources.
[00:31:39.237 --> 00:31:40.818]  I love the sound of real money.

[00:31:51.941 --> 00:31:52.781]  Call now, 800-686-2237.
[00:31:52.821 --> 00:31:53.001]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:32:00.928 --> 00:32:03.149]  Hey boys, Valentine's Day is coming.
[00:32:03.469 --> 00:32:05.930]  Why wait until Valentine's Day to surprise her?
[00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:09.451]  Visit Flowershop.com and send her flowers today.
[00:32:09.812 --> 00:32:14.513]  Nothing says romance like roses, and at Flowershop.com we know roses.
[00:32:14.733 --> 00:32:18.495]  We also know carnations, lilies, snapdragons, and gladiolas.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:19.760]  We know flowers.
[00:32:20.121 --> 00:32:25.904]  We know the excitement that is created when a flower delivery person arrives in an office carrying a bouquet of flowers.
[00:32:26.144 --> 00:32:33.868]  The anticipation grows as everyone tries to guess who the lucky recipient is and the joy and pride when the flowers are placed on her desk.
[00:32:34.088 --> 00:32:37.830]  We also know the envy of those at the desk as the flowers pass by.
[00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:40.631]  So don't wait until you're supposed to send flowers.
[00:32:40.911 --> 00:32:44.454]  Send them today and tell her you couldn't wait to tell her I love you.
[00:32:44.714 --> 00:32:48.137]  So when you need to send flowers, remember Flowershop.com.
[00:32:48.297 --> 00:32:49.278]  It's only natural.
[00:32:49.478 --> 00:32:49.918]  Call 1-800-627-0046.
[00:32:49.978 --> 00:32:50.179]  That's 1-800-627-0046.
[00:32:50.219 --> 00:32:51.840]  Or visit Flowershop.com today.
[00:33:11.055 --> 00:33:21.481]  We're going to have wide open phones on the show today, and I am going to get here in just about five, ten minutes or so to all the callers that are patiently holding, and then I'm going to get back into the news.
[00:33:23.342 --> 00:33:24.743]  We just covered some of the good news.
[00:33:25.546 --> 00:33:26.948]  In fact, I haven't even detailed it yet.
[00:33:27.008 --> 00:33:34.135]  We have the big police associations coming out against the open borders, saying it's getting cops killed, which we've already told you a million times.
[00:33:34.536 --> 00:33:37.218]  We've got the Border Patrol Association coming out.
[00:33:37.238 --> 00:33:42.824]  In fact, we had the director on last week saying this is to destroy the middle class and bring in global government.
[00:33:43.245 --> 00:33:44.526]  Folks are starting to get it!
[00:33:44.546 --> 00:33:47.149]  That's the head of the 8,000-plus strong union.
[00:33:48.261 --> 00:33:50.182]  We have part of the Patriot Act being thrown out.
[00:33:50.242 --> 00:33:53.323]  Then coming up, three doctors dispute how Dr. David Kelly died.
[00:33:53.683 --> 00:33:55.884]  Top scientists who looked at the evidence.
[00:33:56.404 --> 00:34:00.765]  Again, the headline of the evening standard, Dr. Kelly did not kill himself.
[00:34:00.845 --> 00:34:06.968]  Well, the eyewitnesses saw a bunch of guys in black uniforms standing around the dead body who ran off when the police came up.
[00:34:07.568 --> 00:34:10.769]  I mean, the news says, not a murder, not a murder.
[00:34:11.702 --> 00:34:12.683]  So we'll get into that.
[00:34:13.003 --> 00:34:23.012]  Also, what some of the new leaked news memos are saying about the government staging actors playing the part of troops, saying how much they love the war on television.
[00:34:24.073 --> 00:34:27.096]  Howard Dean called for microchip ID card.
[00:34:41.963 --> 00:34:43.708]  We're good to go.
[00:34:56.755 --> 00:34:57.476]  All right, folks.
[00:34:57.596 --> 00:34:58.877]  Again, thank you for bearing with us.
[00:34:59.337 --> 00:35:00.578]  This used to happen about once a year.
[00:35:00.598 --> 00:35:02.320]  The last few weeks it's happened quite a bit.
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:05.062]  And by the way, only when we're live.
[00:35:05.142 --> 00:35:07.524]  We can connect for hours and not have this happen.
[00:35:07.544 --> 00:35:11.487]  It happened about three years ago like this, and we'll just have to work around it.
[00:35:11.527 --> 00:35:12.728]  Appreciate everybody out there.
[00:35:13.388 --> 00:35:16.270]  But again, all that news is coming up after we go to some of your calls.
[00:35:16.711 --> 00:35:17.932]  Coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:35:18.412 --> 00:35:20.634]  But first off, I want to bring Jack Brownrigg up.
[00:35:22.432 --> 00:35:25.636]  Jack hasn't been on the show in about six months or so.
[00:35:25.656 --> 00:35:26.658]  Been a while, Alex.
[00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:32.705]  And he's one of the head honchos at Midas Resources, a great supporter, one of the biggest sponsors of this network.
[00:35:33.504 --> 00:35:37.305]  Here to talk about the economy and where gold is at right now is Jack Brownrigg.
[00:35:37.345 --> 00:35:37.605]  Jack?
[00:35:38.085 --> 00:35:39.385]  Alex, thanks for having me on the show.
[00:35:39.446 --> 00:35:42.066]  It has been a while and it's a real pleasure to be back on with you.
[00:35:42.266 --> 00:35:42.626]  You bet.
[00:35:42.886 --> 00:35:45.687]  First thing I want everybody to do is write down this telephone number.
[00:35:45.727 --> 00:35:49.068]  This is going to be an all-important telephone number for you in a couple minutes.
[00:35:49.428 --> 00:35:49.688]  That's 888-294-6187.
[00:35:49.708 --> 00:35:49.848]  888-294-6187.
[00:35:49.868 --> 00:35:52.229]  Don't worry, I'll give it to you again.
[00:35:52.369 --> 00:35:53.989]  But don't forget that number.
[00:36:01.551 --> 00:36:03.173]  That's an Alex Jones number.
[00:36:03.673 --> 00:36:07.356]  It's Alex Jones listeners only I'm going to be talking to about these coins.
[00:36:08.898 --> 00:36:12.581]  Alex, I've never offered MS62 coins on your show before.
[00:36:12.601 --> 00:36:14.223]  I've never offered slabbed coins.
[00:36:14.403 --> 00:36:23.091]  Slabbed coins mean they're certified independently by outside companies, not necessarily Midas Resources, actually not Midas Resources.
[00:36:23.547 --> 00:36:28.788]  PCGS, Professional Coin Grading Service, NGC, Numismatic Guarantee Corporation.
[00:36:29.149 --> 00:36:32.049]  These are two companies that do nothing but grade coins.
[00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:34.390]  They don't buy or sell coins.
[00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:37.691]  They grade coins and they guarantee that grade of the coin.
[00:36:37.711 --> 00:36:45.053]  You never have to worry about somebody telling you your coin isn't what you said it was when somebody sold it to you because you've got it.
[00:36:45.805 --> 00:36:47.647]  Hermetically sealed in a slab.
[00:36:48.167 --> 00:36:50.629]  This is something that everybody should be looking at.
[00:36:50.909 --> 00:36:52.671]  There's nothing wrong with the circulated coins.
[00:36:52.691 --> 00:36:53.732]  Don't misunderstand me.
[00:36:54.412 --> 00:36:57.915]  But right now, gold moving the way it is, it's up about $6 today.
[00:36:57.955 --> 00:36:59.197]  It's well over $4.10.
[00:37:00.358 --> 00:37:03.480]  Everything looks strong, strong, strong for gold.
[00:37:03.981 --> 00:37:08.044]  Now is the time to jump in to some of these slab coins.
[00:37:08.424 --> 00:37:11.147]  What I've got today, $20 gold pieces.
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:18.062]  This is an unusual offer, Alex, and it's only for listeners of your show.
[00:37:18.142 --> 00:37:24.945]  I'm selling Saints and or Liberties at the same price for listeners of Alex Jones Show.
[00:37:25.225 --> 00:37:26.386]  I'm going to go beyond that.
[00:37:27.246 --> 00:37:28.607]  I'm going to go well beyond that.
[00:37:28.947 --> 00:37:38.271]  If you buy just Liberties, $20 Liberties, I'll give you at least seven different dates and or mint marks in a slabbed coin, independently graded coin, MS-62.
[00:37:38.311 --> 00:37:38.831]  If you buy Saints...
[00:37:41.854 --> 00:37:42.354]  We're good to go.
[00:37:42.374 --> 00:37:43.074]  We're good to go.
[00:37:43.114 --> 00:37:43.555]  We're good to go.
[00:38:02.327 --> 00:38:07.349]  I can sell them to you in groups of 10 or 20, mixed up like that.
[00:38:07.709 --> 00:38:11.431]  Now, first off, first thing some of the guys say, geez, I can't afford 10 or 20.
[00:38:12.031 --> 00:38:12.471]  You know what?
[00:38:12.871 --> 00:38:15.593]  Don't say, I can't afford 10 or 20.
[00:38:16.173 --> 00:38:21.035]  Call up your broker here at the Alex line, 888-294-6187.
[00:38:21.735 --> 00:38:23.496]  Let them know what you need to protect.
[00:38:24.056 --> 00:38:26.117]  You need to protect your loved ones.
[00:38:26.137 --> 00:38:27.398]  You need to protect yourself.
[00:38:27.438 --> 00:38:28.318]  You don't need to protect
[00:38:29.051 --> 00:38:29.951]  Cable television.
[00:38:30.412 --> 00:38:32.112]  You don't need to protect anything else.
[00:38:32.152 --> 00:38:34.473]  This is life and death, people.
[00:38:34.813 --> 00:38:36.574]  This is absolutely life and death.
[00:38:37.094 --> 00:38:43.637]  Give us a call today on the Alex line, 888-294-6187.
[00:38:44.997 --> 00:38:50.479]  Alex, when we get off the air, when you're off the air, I'm going to be talking to you about adding some of these to your portfolio.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.380]  Well, I bought coins.
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:53.641]  I know you bought coins.
[00:38:53.661 --> 00:38:54.101]  Three times.
[00:38:54.581 --> 00:38:54.821]  Right.
[00:38:54.961 --> 00:38:56.542]  And I was very pleased with it and...
[00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:05.535]  One of my buys, let me see, I made $150 per coin, an increase in value.
[00:39:05.635 --> 00:39:12.238]  I'd pay $250 for a coin, and now it's worth over $400, so I guess that's more than $150.
[00:39:13.019 --> 00:39:17.882]  Some of the coins I bought have gone up about $75 in value apiece.
[00:39:18.042 --> 00:39:18.702]  And you know what?
[00:39:18.742 --> 00:39:19.443]  I got calls.
[00:39:21.046 --> 00:39:25.470]  Yeah, you're tough on us.
[00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:26.591]  You won't sell us back to them.
[00:39:26.671 --> 00:39:27.872]  I understand that, Alex.
[00:39:28.292 --> 00:39:28.793]  And you know what?
[00:39:29.714 --> 00:39:32.716]  We will buy them back, but you'll have to force us into buying them back.
[00:39:33.097 --> 00:39:43.226]  Folks, people that listen to Alex Jones and buy what Alex Jones bought, because Alex has never bought a coin from anybody other than me or Midas Resources.
[00:39:44.355 --> 00:39:48.076]  I've never sold him anything that I didn't also offer on his show.
[00:39:48.696 --> 00:39:51.397]  So think about it, folks.
[00:39:51.897 --> 00:39:58.819]  Had you listened and acted at the same time Alex had before, you'd be in profit situations with that.
[00:39:59.179 --> 00:40:03.360]  Not necessarily telling you that you should sell or telling Alex that he should sell.
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:10.525]  I'm willing to buy Alex's coins back, but I'm not looking to buy them back because I don't think he's moved anywhere near where they're going to move.
[00:40:10.785 --> 00:40:11.785]  Now, I was talking to Michael.
[00:40:11.825 --> 00:40:13.126]  He's like, hey, you want to sell those back?
[00:40:13.647 --> 00:40:16.048]  But seriously, folks, I believe in gold.
[00:40:16.128 --> 00:40:17.389]  I believe in real things.
[00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:21.172]  And when you get these coins, you also don't just get the gold value.
[00:40:21.272 --> 00:40:24.994]  You also get the collector value with them as well.
[00:40:25.575 --> 00:40:27.216]  And gold is...
[00:40:28.156 --> 00:40:37.205]  Over time, it always goes back up, and it's not like our fiat currency that's been devalued by 42% in the last year and a half.
[00:40:37.245 --> 00:40:39.847]  So I do hope that people will call 888-294-6187 and take advantage of that.
[00:40:39.867 --> 00:40:39.947]  888-294-6187.
[00:40:39.967 --> 00:40:40.628]  Anything else, Jack?
[00:40:48.275 --> 00:40:52.860]  Alex, I just implore the folks to listen and to give us a call today.
[00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:54.081]  Gold is moving it today.
[00:40:54.162 --> 00:40:56.284]  Like I said, it's up $6 plus today.
[00:40:56.304 --> 00:40:57.805]  13-year high.
[00:40:58.907 --> 00:41:01.029]  I've been doing this for 26 years, Alex.
[00:41:01.549 --> 00:41:08.637]  I'm as happy right now with the way gold is going as I was in 1979 because it looks like we're off to the races here.
[00:41:09.281 --> 00:41:14.324]  Give us a call today on the Alex line, 888-294-6187.
[00:41:15.704 --> 00:41:17.645]  Tell them you're a loyal Alex Jones listener.
[00:41:18.025 --> 00:41:19.826]  Tell them you want the Alex Jones special.
[00:41:21.147 --> 00:41:31.052]  As a bonus, as a bonus, anybody that buys 10 coins, I will give a free subscription to the International Forecaster.
[00:41:31.432 --> 00:41:31.853]  All right.
[00:41:31.873 --> 00:41:33.353]  Well, Jack, thanks for coming on the show.
[00:41:33.774 --> 00:41:34.414]  My pleasure, Alex.
[00:41:34.434 --> 00:41:34.694]  You bet.
[00:41:34.734 --> 00:41:35.514]  I appreciate that.
[00:41:35.574 --> 00:41:36.215]  Now, again...
[00:41:36.915 --> 00:41:40.436]  I have stacks of news on Skull and Bones, mainstream stuff, folks.
[00:41:41.176 --> 00:41:44.977]  I have stacks of news about the Bushes and the Bin Ladens coming out, mainstream news.
[00:41:44.997 --> 00:41:52.579]  You've already heard it on this show, but it's years ago, but it's important to go back over it when it finally breaks in the mainstream media.
[00:41:52.619 --> 00:41:53.399]  That is coming up.
[00:41:54.139 --> 00:41:55.559]  Right now, let's go to the calls.
[00:41:56.339 --> 00:41:58.280]  Let's talk to Charles in Louisiana.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.220]  Charles, you're on the air.
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:41:59.940]  Thanks for holding.
[00:42:01.661 --> 00:42:03.081]  I appreciate you holding, Charles.
[00:42:03.121 --> 00:42:03.461]  Go ahead.
[00:42:06.255 --> 00:42:07.577]  Charles, how are you doing, Mr. Jones?
[00:42:07.677 --> 00:42:08.317]  I'm doing okay.
[00:42:08.357 --> 00:42:08.738]  Go ahead.
[00:42:08.898 --> 00:42:09.819]  I've got some news.
[00:42:10.279 --> 00:42:12.721]  I heard this last night, and I checked a couple of people.
[00:42:12.741 --> 00:42:17.666]  I don't have a computer, but this is what's on the computer.
[00:42:17.686 --> 00:42:20.049]  It's on almartins.com.
[00:42:20.469 --> 00:42:24.513]  The CIA was planting bombs in Iraq and got killed.
[00:42:25.494 --> 00:42:26.455]  Did you hear anything about this?
[00:42:27.503 --> 00:42:28.944]  I did, but I can't confirm that.
[00:42:29.004 --> 00:42:44.134]  I can confirm that an admitted CIA agent was planting bombs in the Philippines last year, and one went off before he got in the building and blew his legs off, and the CIA landed and took him out of the country, and that came out in the major papers there.
[00:42:44.615 --> 00:42:49.618]  And then a bunch of Special Forces troops took over a shopping mall, didn't hurt anybody, and said, we're doing this.
[00:42:50.098 --> 00:42:55.142]  To get attention to the fact that we're being shot with bullets that our own government's giving the terrorists.
[00:42:55.162 --> 00:42:56.443]  They work for the CIA.
[00:42:56.904 --> 00:42:59.746]  Our government's doing this to maintain, quote, martial law.
[00:43:00.187 --> 00:43:03.910]  I know MI5's carried out most of the bombings in the last 25 years in England.
[00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:08.614]  I know Israel, according to Haratz and Jerusalem Post, has carried out some of the bombings in Israel.
[00:43:09.094 --> 00:43:18.702]  I know that Vladimir Putin was caught planting bombs in the 4th apartment building back in 99 as a pretext to invade Chechnya and be elected as a popular war president.
[00:43:19.442 --> 00:43:24.285]  I know that The Globalist carried out September 11th, but there's new info I cannot confirm.
[00:43:24.525 --> 00:43:28.367]  Well, the woman that blew the whistle is called Melba Rogers.
[00:43:29.568 --> 00:43:30.848]  She works for the government.
[00:43:32.529 --> 00:43:36.191]  I'm researching that now and looking at that right now, Charles.
[00:43:36.951 --> 00:43:38.332]  Can I just say one thing I'd like to tell you?
[00:43:38.352 --> 00:43:43.315]  I know you'll probably get tired of me talking about this, but the people have to show their fury.
[00:43:43.755 --> 00:43:47.517]  And how they do that is to show your fury is to wake other people up.
[00:43:47.987 --> 00:43:49.268]  This is our only chance.
[00:43:49.608 --> 00:43:53.731]  And I wish people would just try to push to the front a little harder.
[00:43:53.771 --> 00:43:54.931]  We don't have much time.
[00:43:55.472 --> 00:44:00.315]  And these tapes are like a mini paper press.
[00:44:01.235 --> 00:44:02.056]  Just one tape.
[00:44:02.396 --> 00:44:04.337]  You don't know whose hands you're going to give it to.
[00:44:04.617 --> 00:44:06.799]  That person might make thousands of copies.
[00:44:07.459 --> 00:44:08.540]  You know what I mean, Mr. Jones?
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:10.121]  Absolutely.
[00:44:10.521 --> 00:44:14.423]  And if people have to show their fury by this...
[00:44:16.401 --> 00:44:17.742]  If people would just do this.
[00:44:17.842 --> 00:44:19.323]  I mean, just do it on the weekends.
[00:44:19.723 --> 00:44:20.664]  Buy a few tapes.
[00:44:21.805 --> 00:44:22.425]  Give them out.
[00:44:22.465 --> 00:44:23.366]  Spend a few dollars.
[00:44:23.706 --> 00:44:25.127]  Keep the program on air.
[00:44:25.147 --> 00:44:26.828]  These programs are the only thing we've got.
[00:44:27.148 --> 00:44:32.151]  And people don't realize until we lose things what we lost when it's too late.
[00:44:32.712 --> 00:44:35.393]  And I urge people to get these tapes.
[00:44:36.574 --> 00:44:37.315]  I'm telling you what.
[00:44:38.295 --> 00:44:39.296]  Just take a neighborhood.
[00:44:39.816 --> 00:44:42.118]  One person can just wake up a whole neighborhood by himself.
[00:44:42.714 --> 00:44:49.258]  Well, I have found that about 90% of those that see the videos do wake up because they're so hardcore.
[00:44:49.298 --> 00:44:50.519]  I mean, it's the globalists.
[00:44:50.539 --> 00:44:52.120]  It's not Alex Jones making the claims.
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:45:00.525]  We have the globalists admitting from their own documents and on television and in their own legislation what they're setting up, what they're doing.
[00:45:01.146 --> 00:45:02.687]  And we've never steered folks wrong.
[00:45:02.747 --> 00:45:03.707]  Thanks for the call, Charles.
[00:45:04.388 --> 00:45:07.510]  And, I mean, going back over this...
[00:45:08.391 --> 00:45:13.373]  Just briefly, we told you that there were official plans to invade Iraq before Bush got elected.
[00:45:14.133 --> 00:45:16.214]  It's their own admissions, a PNAC.
[00:45:16.715 --> 00:45:21.737]  And then everybody freaks out when David Kaye, our head inspector, says he was lied to and it was all a fraud.
[00:45:22.077 --> 00:45:22.957]  People can't believe it.
[00:45:23.317 --> 00:45:32.041]  When Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill goes public about the first cabinet meeting being a plan to invade Iraq and Dick Cheney's Energy Commission with the maps of who was going to get the oil.
[00:45:33.092 --> 00:45:34.213]  But forget all that.
[00:45:34.293 --> 00:45:35.694]  We have the PNAC documents.
[00:45:36.154 --> 00:45:38.335]  It's a signed, published confession.
[00:45:38.375 --> 00:45:41.077]  It's not like some confession that, oh, we claim we found.
[00:45:41.357 --> 00:45:42.298]  They published it.
[00:45:42.718 --> 00:45:44.139]  They put it in their own magazine.
[00:45:44.219 --> 00:45:45.580]  They put it on their own website.
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:49.463]  Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Richard Perle.
[00:45:50.063 --> 00:45:51.404]  We've been lied to, folks.
[00:45:51.464 --> 00:45:53.145]  They say Saddam wasn't a threat.
[00:45:53.766 --> 00:45:56.247]  But see, they go, oh, look, the liberals are against the war.
[00:45:56.287 --> 00:45:57.388]  You're not a liberal, are you?
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:01.282]  Well, in truth, Bill Clinton is saying they were really weapons of mass destruction.
[00:46:01.302 --> 00:46:02.043]  He supports Bush.
[00:46:02.283 --> 00:46:03.444]  Hillary Clinton's for the war.
[00:46:03.704 --> 00:46:04.524]  Chuckie Schumer.
[00:46:05.485 --> 00:46:06.806]  All the real socialists.
[00:46:06.866 --> 00:46:08.727]  It's like Bush's campaign finance reform.
[00:46:09.267 --> 00:46:10.668]  The dream child of Bill Clinton.
[00:46:10.909 --> 00:46:12.730]  He couldn't get it, but George Bush did.
[00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:16.452]  Because conservatives have gone to sleep under Bush.
[00:46:17.753 --> 00:46:22.036]  Let's go to Dave in Ohio, then Chris, Garen, Jack, and others.
[00:46:22.076 --> 00:46:22.656]  Go ahead, Dave.
[00:46:22.676 --> 00:46:23.597]  Hi, Alex.
[00:46:24.117 --> 00:46:24.398]  Hello.
[00:46:25.178 --> 00:46:26.319]  Good to finally get a chance to talk to you.
[00:46:26.786 --> 00:46:28.688]  I had a couple of things that I wanted to let you know.
[00:46:28.828 --> 00:46:33.652]  One was that you've gone over this thing a bunch of times on the Silverstein video, Annette.
[00:46:34.332 --> 00:46:45.162]  But last Thursday, I decided to send a link in email to about 25 different friends on the page that you had set up on PrisonPlanet.com with all the different videos and all the different information.
[00:46:46.603 --> 00:46:54.570]  And I sent out the 25 emails about 11 o'clock Thursday night, and then Friday I decided to check it because I put in the email that I wanted comments back from me and my friends on what they thought about this.
[00:46:55.709 --> 00:47:03.856]  And Friday night, I go to go into my email, check it, and I type in my password, and of course, it says invalid password or username.
[00:47:03.876 --> 00:47:13.803]  So I tried this three times, got the same message, and I decided to click on the Help button, and I did that, and let me get a page that comes up that says this Yahoo account has been deactivated.
[00:47:13.824 --> 00:47:23.131]  So I found that to be quite interesting, and I went to go to my Yahoo Messenger to see if I could get on that and talk to some people, and I plug in my username and password,
[00:47:23.755 --> 00:47:27.579]  And I get a little message that comes up, says, System, your account has been locked for security reasons.
[00:47:28.279 --> 00:47:33.644]  So that's never happened before when I've emailed anything out and I've got this happening now.
[00:47:33.664 --> 00:47:36.827]  So that was kind of interesting that that happened within a 24-hour period of time.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:38.509]  They're very upset.
[00:47:39.506 --> 00:47:40.947]  About the Silverstein story.
[00:47:41.487 --> 00:47:42.087]  I can see that.
[00:47:43.927 --> 00:47:48.489]  Well, yeah, I mean, my show would probably go off the air about 10 seconds once a year.
[00:47:48.989 --> 00:47:49.189]  Right.
[00:47:49.529 --> 00:47:52.350]  And now it's continually happening.
[00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:55.351]  We've had the phone company out here eight times and looked at it.
[00:47:55.391 --> 00:47:56.671]  We can connect when we're not live.
[00:47:56.711 --> 00:47:57.332]  Nothing happens.
[00:47:57.732 --> 00:47:58.932]  Then when we're live, this happens.
[00:47:58.952 --> 00:48:00.153]  I have to go to a backup studio.
[00:48:00.173 --> 00:48:01.053]  I'm considering that now.
[00:48:01.993 --> 00:48:04.054]  Right now, permanently moving to the backup studio.
[00:48:05.054 --> 00:48:08.016]  But, again, they better be concerned.
[00:48:08.056 --> 00:48:10.857]  Silverstein slipped up and said they blew up WTC7.
[00:48:10.977 --> 00:48:11.757]  Exactly right.
[00:48:11.797 --> 00:48:13.218]  I've talked to some people in the office.
[00:48:13.298 --> 00:48:18.620]  I work in financial services, which is another area that I wanted to discuss something on.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:24.062]  But a lot of the people that I've told to watch this stuff or look at this stuff, they won't even take the time to look at it.
[00:48:24.102 --> 00:48:30.185]  I did have two guys actually did look at the video, and what they told me, this is what their opinion was, was Silverstein didn't say anything.
[00:48:30.558 --> 00:48:30.938]  This is classic.
[00:48:52.083 --> 00:48:56.609]  I mean, look, when Bill Clinton got caught lying, he said it depends on what the word is is means.
[00:48:56.669 --> 00:48:59.373]  So, it's psychological gymnastics.
[00:48:59.433 --> 00:49:07.904]  We have them saying the building's on fire, there's been such a loss of life, we talked to the fire department, we made the decision to pull it, we said pull it, we watched it collapse, and we
[00:49:07.944 --> 00:49:08.084]  Uh-uh.
[00:49:08.104 --> 00:49:08.664]  That's not the case.
[00:49:37.356 --> 00:49:38.157]  That's not what happened.
[00:49:38.317 --> 00:49:40.219]  You look at FEMA's report, too, on the end of Chapter 5.
[00:49:40.419 --> 00:49:42.722]  I mean, it actually says in there that the building collapsed.
[00:49:42.782 --> 00:49:48.888]  After all, there are investigative reports saying that it definitely collapsed because of an internal weakness and implosion.
[00:49:48.928 --> 00:49:51.110]  They actually use the word implosion in the FEMA report.
[00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:52.111]  So...
[00:49:54.542 --> 00:49:55.242]  It's incredible.
[00:49:55.342 --> 00:49:58.723]  In fact, I said we'd air those clips again yesterday, and we only aired one of them.
[00:49:58.843 --> 00:50:01.543]  I will air those clips again in the next hour.
[00:50:01.563 --> 00:50:06.324]  You can go watch the video at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:50:06.864 --> 00:50:11.725]  And I suggest folks continue to email it out to people so everybody can see this for themselves.
[00:50:12.365 --> 00:50:18.026]  But I was doing national shows this weekend, and people would call in and go, well, what does it mean if they blew it up?
[00:50:18.086 --> 00:50:18.827]  What's the big deal?
[00:50:19.087 --> 00:50:21.127]  Because they said they didn't all along.
[00:50:21.727 --> 00:50:21.887]  Right.
[00:50:21.947 --> 00:50:22.288]  Exactly.
[00:50:42.609 --> 00:50:45.072]  And one of the guys even said, well, so what if he blew up his own building?
[00:50:45.092 --> 00:50:45.772]  He had the right to do it.
[00:50:45.792 --> 00:50:46.173]  He owned it.
[00:50:47.174 --> 00:50:48.415]  Why don't we discuss this more?
[00:50:49.075 --> 00:50:51.157]  By the way, a Secret Service agent died in the building.
[00:50:51.478 --> 00:50:52.939]  Oh, so another one said, so what?
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:55.942]  Yeah, so what, as long as I don't have to have any responsibility.
[00:50:56.423 --> 00:50:57.223]  I don't want to hear about it.
[00:50:57.263 --> 00:50:58.164]  I want to be a slave.
[00:50:58.404 --> 00:50:59.185]  Well, don't worry, buddy.
[00:50:59.205 --> 00:50:59.726]  You will be.
[00:51:02.008 --> 00:51:04.871]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:51:05.581 --> 00:51:06.882]  Alex Jones here, America.

[00:51:31.718 --> 00:51:37.986]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.046 --> 00:51:39.869]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:53:47.387 --> 00:53:50.489]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.649 --> 00:53:56.673]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:10.041 --> 00:54:13.063]  The Building 7 story is massive.
[00:54:14.244 --> 00:54:15.425]  So I will recap that.
[00:54:16.192 --> 00:54:29.717]  Early in the next hour, we're about to go back to Dave and Chris and Garen and Jeff and Joe and many others that are patiently holding, and then I'll get into the Skull and Bones news and the latest Bush-Bin Laden connection information that's out there.
[00:54:29.797 --> 00:54:41.922]  Just briefly before I go back to calls, if you want powerful videos that will wake people up, you've heard the listeners rant and rave about them, get 9-11 Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:54:43.709 --> 00:54:45.471]  And I want you to make copies of my videos.
[00:54:45.491 --> 00:54:47.672]  In fact, I don't want you to order them unless you're going to make copies.
[00:54:47.712 --> 00:54:54.198]  If you have the videos and were impressed with them and checked out the information in them, please make copies of the films you already have.
[00:54:54.875 --> 00:54:58.716]  I know a lot of you have got them but haven't made copies, or you loan out the originals and never get a bite.
[00:54:59.196 --> 00:55:00.077]  Make copies.
[00:55:00.857 --> 00:55:06.158]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and help us circumvent the mainstream media.
[00:55:06.639 --> 00:55:09.860]  Once you open somebody's eyes up, there's no going back for them.
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:11.640]  And the globalists, see, they're weak.
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:14.041]  They have to reapply their lies over and over again.
[00:55:14.261 --> 00:55:14.881]  We don't have to.
[00:55:14.921 --> 00:55:15.961]  We just put the truth out.
[00:55:16.442 --> 00:55:17.382]  It stands on its own.
[00:55:18.067 --> 00:55:20.409]  So infowars.com or prisonplanet.com to order, or 1-888-253-3139.
[00:55:20.429 --> 00:55:25.113]  That's 888-253-3139, or just write to me, and I'm Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:55:42.193 --> 00:55:45.494]  Some of the films are 2 hours, 40 minutes, 2 hours, 25 minutes.
[00:55:45.814 --> 00:55:46.955]  They're all over 2 hours.
[00:55:46.975 --> 00:55:49.235]  Some are 2 hours, 5 minutes, 2 hours, 10 minutes.
[00:55:50.076 --> 00:55:51.056]  They're $25.95.
[00:55:51.256 --> 00:55:52.156]  Order 3 or more.
[00:55:52.176 --> 00:55:53.797]  They drop down to $20 apiece.
[00:55:54.637 --> 00:55:55.897]  We've got discounts on the books.
[00:55:55.977 --> 00:55:57.218]  We've got books on tape.
[00:55:57.958 --> 00:56:00.499]  About September 11th, we carry a lot of other great items.
[00:56:01.079 --> 00:56:04.620]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.921]  Let's go ahead now and go back to the calls.
[00:56:11.663 --> 00:56:13.424]  I guess we were just talking to Dave in Ohio.
[00:56:13.504 --> 00:56:15.785]  Now we're talking to Garen in Rhode Island.
[00:56:15.825 --> 00:56:16.745]  Garen, thanks for holding.
[00:56:16.765 --> 00:56:17.145]  Go ahead.
[00:56:17.525 --> 00:56:18.025]  Hey, Alex.
[00:56:18.385 --> 00:56:31.770]  I want to let you know that I got a public access TV show in Rhode Island, which actually covers the entire state, and I've been putting on your films, and people have really been waking up to what's going on.
[00:56:32.070 --> 00:56:39.032]  Most people, at least around here, don't really know much about this stuff, but a lot of people that see my TV show
[00:56:41.711 --> 00:56:44.793]  You know, they're really waking up around here to it.
[00:56:45.894 --> 00:56:50.157]  Darren, I've gotten emails from Rhode Island folks watching the Axis show.
[00:56:50.297 --> 00:56:57.701]  I've signed over 400 Axis television waiver forms for folks to air them, though the films say on them you're allowed to air them.
[00:56:57.961 --> 00:57:01.123]  In the takeover, I give the clearance right there on the film to air all my films.
[00:57:01.784 --> 00:57:05.366]  And how many subscribers are there to this statewide cable system?
[00:57:06.287 --> 00:57:09.769]  Well, it covers the entire state, so...
[00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:15.633]  Potentially over a million people, depending on who actually has... And let's say watching at any one time.
[00:57:15.673 --> 00:57:16.613]  What time is your show on?
[00:57:17.354 --> 00:57:18.614]  It's on Sunday mornings at 1130.
[00:57:18.814 --> 00:57:24.877]  So... That's not a peak time, but I would guess that tens of thousands watch at any one time.
[00:57:25.138 --> 00:57:26.278]  Think of what you're doing.
[00:57:26.638 --> 00:57:27.959]  Think of the effect you're having.
[00:57:27.979 --> 00:57:29.400]  And you're saying folks are waking up.
[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:30.300]  Oh, yeah.
[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:32.221]  I get emails, calls.
[00:57:32.641 --> 00:57:35.743]  Calls came in to the Cox Communications office.
[00:57:35.863 --> 00:57:37.444]  I got personal telephone calls.
[00:57:37.464 --> 00:57:37.864]  Besides...
[00:57:38.453 --> 00:57:43.479]  I always steer them to Infowars.com, tell them to buy your videos.
[00:57:43.919 --> 00:57:46.202]  Yeah, it's had a big effect around here.
[00:57:46.222 --> 00:57:48.585]  Well, that's incredible.
[00:57:48.885 --> 00:57:52.809]  Again, my dad is a medical consultant.
[00:57:52.969 --> 00:57:57.014]  He's also an oral surgeon and has some other medical degrees.
[00:57:58.641 --> 00:58:10.108]  My father has been in hotel rooms in San Francisco, Kansas City, Florida, and he'll turn the television on in the hotel room, and there's his son.
[00:58:10.628 --> 00:58:14.131]  Because of you guys, it's had a massive effect.
[00:58:14.391 --> 00:58:14.891]  Oh, it has.
[00:58:15.892 --> 00:58:16.792]  It's excellent.
[00:58:16.872 --> 00:58:18.994]  It's an excellent tool to wake people up.
[00:58:19.114 --> 00:58:20.074]  What do you think of Building 7?
[00:58:21.535 --> 00:58:25.618]  Oh, that's smoking gun evidence right there that...
[00:58:26.607 --> 00:58:31.431]  That it was engineered and staged by our own government and the globalists.
[00:58:31.492 --> 00:58:43.763]  If you can't realize that after seeing Silverstein admit that they pulled the building a few hours after the 9-11 attacks, they would have never had time to... Tell you what, stay there, Gary.
[00:58:43.783 --> 00:58:47.626]  In the second hour that's coming up, I'll let you finish up with your points, and we'll go to other callers and more news.
[00:58:47.846 --> 00:58:48.327]  Stay with us.
[00:58:51.377 --> 00:58:54.661]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:58:54.721 --> 00:58:58.886]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:58:59.146 --> 00:59:01.949]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:59:02.129 --> 00:59:04.532]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:59:04.732 --> 00:59:08.176]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water
[00:59:09.878 --> 00:59:10.499]  We're good to go.
[00:59:27.694 --> 00:59:30.595]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:59:30.635 --> 00:59:31.895]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:59:57.592 --> 00:59:58.232]  Big Brother.
[00:59:58.893 --> 00:59:59.973]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:00.674 --> 01:00:01.774]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.434 --> 01:00:03.235]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.015 --> 01:00:05.916]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.936 --> 01:00:09.198]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.738 --> 01:00:13.880]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:19.923]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m.
[01:00:19.983 --> 01:00:25.366]  until 2 p.m., and then back from 9 to midnight Central, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.432 --> 01:00:32.977]  There has been some good news we've gone over so far in the show today.
[01:00:33.938 --> 01:00:37.221]  We have a judge throwing out a portion of the Patriot Act.
[01:00:37.642 --> 01:00:44.308]  We have Republican lawmakers saying they won't back Bush on immigration plan, and that's admittedly because of the heat you've put on them.
[01:00:45.509 --> 01:00:50.574]  Also, we're going to get into top doctors saying that Dr. David Kelley was obviously murdered.
[01:00:51.368 --> 01:00:52.149]  We're good to go.
[01:01:12.029 --> 01:01:18.412]  And we're going to get into Skull and Bones and a big Canadian report about the Bushes and the Bin Ladens.
[01:01:18.652 --> 01:01:19.912]  That's coming up as well.
[01:01:19.972 --> 01:01:22.053]  Plus, top 9-11 suspect was granted U.S.
[01:01:22.753 --> 01:01:23.174]  visa.
[01:01:23.274 --> 01:01:25.775]  Right now, we're going to go back to your calls, as promised.
[01:01:26.195 --> 01:01:28.036]  Full free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:32.248 --> 01:01:37.032]  And it will also be airing clips from the PBS documentary, America Rebuilding, because we've had so many requests to do it.
[01:01:37.472 --> 01:01:49.122]  Those that aren't online and can't see it at the website, simplewars.com or prisonplanet.com, where they talk about destroying, pulling, demolishing Building 7 on September 11th, that afternoon at 435 Eastern Time.
[01:01:49.662 --> 01:01:52.905]  Right now, let's go back to Garen in Rhode Island, who got cut short by the break.
[01:01:52.945 --> 01:01:53.886]  Anything else, Garen?
[01:01:54.426 --> 01:01:58.029]  Yeah, well, I was just saying about that story is huge.
[01:01:58.089 --> 01:02:01.151]  I mean, like I said, that's the smoking gun evidence.
[01:02:01.211 --> 01:02:01.752]  If you can't
[01:02:02.170 --> 01:02:16.560]  Wake up to what happened after seeing that story and Silverstein admit that they pulled the building and it's an impossibility for them to have put those explosives and set them up in a few hours time that only leads to one conclusion.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.962]  There is only one conclusion to that.
[01:02:19.662 --> 01:02:27.167]  And I think when this story gets out to more and more people, really, I mean, you can't deny it, in my opinion.
[01:02:27.388 --> 01:02:28.829]  There's just no way you can deny it.
[01:02:29.569 --> 01:02:30.610]  And another thing is with
[01:02:31.668 --> 01:02:45.638]  I don't watch TV much, but the last couple of nights, and surfing through the channels a little bit, Sunday night saw a deep impact where the president there declares martial law, and it's just like, oh, you know, it's just normal.
[01:02:45.939 --> 01:02:48.340]  I go to a local big gym.
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:49.221]  It's a big chain.
[01:02:50.002 --> 01:02:51.903]  And I'll sit on the stair stepper.
[01:02:52.083 --> 01:02:53.264]  I've lost 20 pounds, folks.
[01:02:53.684 --> 01:02:58.348]  I'll sit on the stair stepper or an exercise bike for an hour when I have time.
[01:02:59.406 --> 01:03:12.736]  And so I'm basically forced to watch five TVs, and they'll all be on different channels with the audio blaring, and it's cop shows, it's dramas, it's all New World Order, Patriot Act, torture, martial law.
[01:03:13.697 --> 01:03:15.758]  And again, I don't really watch television anymore.
[01:03:15.798 --> 01:03:28.528]  I watch the State of the Union, but every week now, going back into the gym, as I become a disgusting fat body, as a drill sergeant would say, sitting there watching this, it's disgusting.
[01:03:29.388 --> 01:03:34.991]  And then sometimes I go at like 3 o'clock when I have time, and I get to watch Maury Povich.
[01:03:35.031 --> 01:03:37.472]  I mean, talk about destroying our culture.
[01:03:37.532 --> 01:03:40.113]  Talk about degrading our culture.
[01:03:40.193 --> 01:03:44.195]  It's just the most... How could anybody willingly watch this?
[01:03:44.975 --> 01:03:50.838]  And then last night, they have Armageddon, which, again, martial law has declared...
[01:03:51.314 --> 01:03:57.978]  And then I noticed on there... They've got this new movie about the Ice Age coming, and it's martial laws declared there.
[01:03:58.419 --> 01:03:58.679]  Yeah.
[01:03:59.039 --> 01:04:05.303]  And then in between, I see the advertisements for NYPD Blue and the police are beating up people.
[01:04:05.323 --> 01:04:08.205]  And then I'm watching the local news, and what do I see?
[01:04:08.585 --> 01:04:10.987]  That they have all these security cameras.
[01:04:11.307 --> 01:04:14.990]  They're placed everywhere on city blocks and highways and streets.
[01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:16.791]  And, oh, it's for our safety.
[01:04:17.666 --> 01:04:19.448]  It's just out of control.
[01:04:19.548 --> 01:04:22.110]  You see it every way you look on TV.
[01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:24.072]  And here's the Associated Press going.
[01:04:24.112 --> 01:04:26.094]  You'll soon be thumb scanning to buy and sell.
[01:04:26.174 --> 01:04:26.834]  It's official.
[01:04:27.195 --> 01:04:28.256]  You're going to have to do this.
[01:04:28.356 --> 01:04:30.437]  How many years have I warned you, folks?
[01:04:32.119 --> 01:04:32.780]  How many years?
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:35.942]  Well, Garen, you keep it up and keep being perceptive and noticing that.
[01:04:35.962 --> 01:04:36.623]  All right.
[01:04:36.663 --> 01:04:37.163]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:04:37.364 --> 01:04:37.924]  God bless you.
[01:04:37.964 --> 01:04:39.025]  Keep up the good work, man.
[01:04:39.045 --> 01:04:39.706]  I appreciate it.
[01:04:40.566 --> 01:04:41.107]  All right.
[01:04:41.647 --> 01:04:42.788]  We'll come back and talk to...
[01:04:44.404 --> 01:04:49.876]  Jeff and Joe and Brock and Roger and others, and then we're going to launch into this news.
[01:04:49.936 --> 01:04:50.678]  You don't want to miss it.
[01:04:50.698 --> 01:04:51.119]  Stay with us.
[01:04:52.785 --> 01:04:54.586]  Got $3 in your pocket?

[01:05:46.441 --> 01:05:49.382]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:05:56.685 --> 01:06:00.187]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:06:00.267 --> 01:06:04.209]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:06:04.429 --> 01:06:10.592]  Black Berkey replacement elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:06:11.012 --> 01:06:18.916]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:06:19.336 --> 01:06:24.680]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:28.602]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:06:28.962 --> 01:06:30.844]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:06:30.884 --> 01:06:33.045]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:06:33.305 --> 01:06:38.549]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:06:38.589 --> 01:06:44.032]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:06:47.214 --> 01:06:51.057]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[01:06:51.678 --> 01:06:56.002]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:06:56.182 --> 01:07:00.606]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:07:00.766 --> 01:07:05.129]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:07:05.169 --> 01:07:06.531]  The New World Order.
[01:07:08.313 --> 01:07:12.537]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:07:12.597 --> 01:07:19.525]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:07:19.665 --> 01:07:21.668]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:07:22.028 --> 01:07:32.412]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:07:32.652 --> 01:07:38.014]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:07:38.534 --> 01:07:41.155]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:07:41.175 --> 01:07:41.736]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:07:41.776 --> 01:07:42.296]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:07:42.316 --> 01:07:43.576]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:07:53.647 --> 01:07:55.831]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:56.432 --> 01:07:59.317]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:01.842 --> 01:08:06.691]  We had a listener call and say, is Alex going to finish his point about Walmart?
[01:08:08.657 --> 01:08:11.938]  We ran into a break and I last hour didn't finish up with it.
[01:08:12.359 --> 01:08:26.264]  I was going into this Associated Press article about how the thumb scanners are going in in the grocery stores and everywhere else now, as we said they would, and how they're going to make you thumb scan when you buy and sell for everyone's security and part of the new national sales tax they're engineering.
[01:08:26.944 --> 01:08:28.885]  How wonderful it is and how it stops crime.
[01:08:28.925 --> 01:08:31.326]  And I was mentioning that Walmart is involved in this.
[01:08:31.946 --> 01:08:36.068]  Walmart is involved tracking and tracing what you buy and profiling you.
[01:08:37.219 --> 01:08:56.421]  And one of the reporters at the Associated Press went in and tried to buy some little lithium batteries for his watches and things, and they were on sale for a dollar apiece, so he tried to buy five of them, and they said, sorry, you can only buy four.
[01:08:57.256 --> 01:08:58.857]  And he said, well, how many things are on the list?
[01:08:58.877 --> 01:09:01.159]  He said, oh, we're adding more all the time.
[01:09:01.199 --> 01:09:08.045]  And so he talked to the manager, and they are instructed to watch what you're buying very closely.
[01:09:08.065 --> 01:09:14.130]  And it's not just the different allergy medicines and things that can be used to be cooked into methamphetamine.
[01:09:14.531 --> 01:09:15.932]  It's hundreds of items.
[01:09:16.012 --> 01:09:21.557]  And they're there reporting to the police what you do and creating databases of all of this.
[01:09:23.467 --> 01:09:24.788]  That's not freedom, my friends.
[01:09:24.848 --> 01:09:25.548]  That's not freedom.
[01:09:25.908 --> 01:09:33.032]  I tell you what, before we go to Jeff and Joe and Brock and Roger and others, let me cover a couple news articles here.
[01:09:34.012 --> 01:09:36.513]  One of them is out of the New York Observer.
[01:09:37.674 --> 01:09:51.821]  Now, two years ago, the New York Observer was able to perch atop a chimney of a building across the street from the tomb in New Haven, Connecticut,
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:56.242]  Where Yale is based.
[01:09:57.463 --> 01:10:04.068]  And they were able to catch on video one of the rituals they do that had been reported and leaked by Skull and Bones members of the past.
[01:10:05.288 --> 01:10:15.255]  And that is ritual throat-slitting of women and then offering their bodies up to Satan and then one of the Skull and Bones members walks out in an outfit
[01:10:16.781 --> 01:10:25.446]  Dressed up like the devil and says, I'm Satan, you can now enter the underworld, your sacrifices serve me well.
[01:10:26.347 --> 01:10:37.214]  And the New York Post reported on it, the New York Times reported on it, Fox, CNN, Peter Jennings, I've got him on video, playing it and saying, oh, they're just having fun, what's the big deal?
[01:10:38.314 --> 01:10:39.675]  And the New York Observer released this.
[01:10:39.775 --> 01:10:42.177]  Well, the New York Observer is now writing about how
[01:10:43.471 --> 01:10:58.536]  A well-known book that was just released last year where this particular woman interviewed hundreds, she said over 100 Skull & Bones members, how they specifically placed disinfo into her story.
[01:10:59.498 --> 01:11:19.682]  And now the New York Observer has obtained the documents where Skull and Bones was laughing and bragging about how they were putting out disinfo about Skull and Bones through her book, trying to discredit the New York Observer and how they were out to get the New York Observer.
[01:11:20.623 --> 01:11:22.123]  That's a big, highly respected...
[01:11:22.987 --> 01:11:23.828]  We're good to go.
[01:11:42.176 --> 01:11:46.019]  And it's not conspiracy, as their title says, but they go over the facts here.
[01:11:46.039 --> 01:11:49.382]  I love how they say conspiracy, and then go over the admitted public facts.
[01:11:49.923 --> 01:11:53.345]  So the headline is, Conspiracy or Coincidence?
[01:11:54.386 --> 01:11:56.548]  And it says, Is it a conspiracy or coincidence?
[01:11:56.648 --> 01:12:00.932]  There is a long entangled history between the Bush family and the elite of Saudi Arabia.
[01:12:01.511 --> 01:12:08.057]  It begins in the 1970s in Houston, Texas, where George W. Bush was just starting out in his family's two businesses of politics and oil.
[01:12:08.578 --> 01:12:13.462]  The powerful and very rich Bin Laden family helped fund the first venture into oil.
[01:12:14.183 --> 01:12:16.745]  The cozy relationship continued for decades.
[01:12:17.186 --> 01:12:25.674]  After a terrorist attack at the barracks in Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 Americans, the Bin Laden family received a multi-billion dollar contract to rebuild it.
[01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:32.786]  Every time I mention that when they blow up, when Al-Qaeda blows up a building, the family then is the payment and gets the money to rebuild it.
[01:12:33.667 --> 01:12:34.948]  That's not the only case, by the way.
[01:12:36.067 --> 01:12:42.171]  So again, the cozy friendship continued for decades after a terrorist attack at a barracks in Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 Americans.
[01:12:42.511 --> 01:12:45.233]  The Bin Laden family received a multi-billion dollar contract to rebuild.
[01:12:45.954 --> 01:12:47.655]  And incredibly, George Bush Sr.
[01:12:47.715 --> 01:12:56.080]  was in a business meeting at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Washington on the morning of September 11th with one of Osama Bin Laden's brothers, the supposed head of the family.
[01:12:56.861 --> 01:13:04.446]  Below is the timeline that details the relationship between the Bin Laden and the Bush's families that culminates in the tragic events of September 11th.
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:14.126]  Well, I mean, we've got FBI agent Robert Wright standing up at the National Press Club crying, saying, here's the letter where if I tell you what I know, I'll be arrested.
[01:13:14.966 --> 01:13:17.048]  That's W-1-9-9-I, folks.
[01:13:18.349 --> 01:13:21.231]  That's an order arising out of that order.
[01:13:22.212 --> 01:13:30.318]  People still deny W-1-9-9-I when it's in the Associated Press and the BBC admitted, Bush said, don't stop the Bill Maudins, don't stop Al-Qaeda.
[01:13:31.371 --> 01:13:34.412]  And again, people just say, well, I'm not going to talk about that.
[01:13:34.452 --> 01:13:35.132]  It's not true.
[01:13:35.453 --> 01:13:36.573]  Okay, it's not true.
[01:13:36.973 --> 01:13:39.294]  Vanity Fair did a big article about this a few months ago.
[01:13:40.274 --> 01:13:44.016]  The flying out of 144 Bin Ladens the night of September 11th.
[01:13:45.176 --> 01:13:47.677]  And I've been reporting that since September 11th.
[01:13:47.857 --> 01:13:49.478]  I've been saying it since the day of the event.
[01:13:50.378 --> 01:13:51.099]  How do I know?
[01:13:51.219 --> 01:13:54.460]  Because it was in the Associated Press September 12th.
[01:13:55.464 --> 01:14:03.851]  And then it was in the Miami Herald September 14th, and then never heard of again, and we were called conspiracy theorists for saying it, and now the Bush White House admits it.
[01:14:04.412 --> 01:14:05.753]  That's right, they admitted it last year.
[01:14:05.773 --> 01:14:07.975]  Right out in plain view.
[01:14:08.035 --> 01:14:09.536]  I guess they can admit they do this.
[01:14:09.736 --> 01:14:16.382]  It's like Jeffrey Dahmer admitting he puts people in his refrigerator, and then the cops say, well, no cannibalism here.
[01:14:18.944 --> 01:14:23.688]  And then the next nine pages are their relationship with them.
[01:14:24.787 --> 01:14:26.489]  And if I have time later, I'll go over this.
[01:14:26.569 --> 01:14:31.894]  I suggest you go to InfoWars.com and read over this for yourself.
[01:14:32.134 --> 01:14:34.557]  It is amazing.
[01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:41.204]  I don't even know how to go over this.
[01:14:42.225 --> 01:14:43.286]  It's just too...
[01:14:44.204 --> 01:14:48.367]  Too incredible, all the connections between them.
[01:14:48.387 --> 01:14:52.149]  And the last entry, and there's been a lot that's happened since, but they say it's the last entry.
[01:14:52.690 --> 01:14:54.651]  The attack occurs the morning of the attack.
[01:14:54.691 --> 01:14:55.571]  George Bush Sr.
[01:14:55.651 --> 01:14:58.593]  is in meetings with members of the Karloff Group in Washington.
[01:14:58.613 --> 01:15:00.174]  Bin Laden's own brother is at the meeting.
[01:15:00.234 --> 01:15:02.416]  Members of the Bin Laden family are allowed to leave the U.S.
[01:15:02.436 --> 01:15:04.377]  without questioning two days later.
[01:15:04.477 --> 01:15:06.298]  No, they started leaving that night, folks.
[01:15:07.999 --> 01:15:08.520]  Get it straight.
[01:15:09.305 --> 01:15:11.545]  Also, top 9-11 suspect was granted U.S.
[01:15:12.066 --> 01:15:12.506]  visa.
[01:15:12.526 --> 01:15:15.666]  This is out of the Financial Times of London today.
[01:15:16.886 --> 01:15:22.067]  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, alleged mastermind behind September 11 plot, was granted a visa to enter the U.S.
[01:15:22.107 --> 01:15:28.328]  just six weeks before the terrorist attacks in Washington, New York, according to a new revelation from the Federal Commission studying the attacks.
[01:15:29.208 --> 01:15:37.650]  Now, that's the whitewashed commission where two of the members have had to secretly testify, quote, according to the Washington Post, because they were involved somehow.
[01:15:38.703 --> 01:15:48.609]  Now, the other Democrat being paid off with the head of the import-export bank, going to head that off for Bush, just... Folks, it's just ridiculous.
[01:15:48.629 --> 01:15:50.810]  You've got to get Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror.
[01:15:51.450 --> 01:16:01.856]  My two films covering September 11th, if you want to know how deep the rabbit hole goes, the hundreds of smoking guns, the total proof, the official government plans to carry out 9-11, my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[01:16:02.665 --> 01:16:04.367]  Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos.
[01:16:04.407 --> 01:16:08.951]  It's just, if we don't tell this story, they're going to keep carrying out the attacks until we submit.
[01:16:10.312 --> 01:16:15.417]  Now, attacks are coming, and when the next attack comes, you've got to give your liberties up, so you'll be safe.
[01:16:15.457 --> 01:16:25.928]  And we've had top generals, the head of NORTHCOM, the outgoing head of CENTCOM, Eberhardt and Franks, saying martial law is the next step, set aside the Constitution, military government.
[01:16:26.650 --> 01:16:29.653]  Oh, the power elite would just hate having total power.
[01:16:30.033 --> 01:16:31.915]  They never want that throughout history.
[01:16:31.975 --> 01:16:34.116]  How ridiculous, people say.
[01:16:34.717 --> 01:16:37.379]  Government's always good, never did any wrong.
[01:16:37.619 --> 01:16:39.161]  We should just give all our rights up.
[01:16:39.201 --> 01:16:40.382]  That's the sensible thing.
[01:16:41.002 --> 01:16:42.984]  But wait, they're saying martial law.
[01:16:43.524 --> 01:16:44.265]  Is that good?
[01:16:44.365 --> 01:16:45.026]  No, it's not.
[01:16:45.306 --> 01:16:46.907]  How long have I been saying martial law?
[01:16:46.947 --> 01:16:48.028]  They were making preparations.
[01:16:49.650 --> 01:16:52.452]  Since I got on the air, folks, ten years ago.
[01:16:53.072 --> 01:16:54.814]  Since I got on radio, eight years ago.
[01:16:55.549 --> 01:16:57.350]  Because I read the government documents.
[01:16:59.512 --> 01:16:59.912]  Oh, boy.
[01:17:00.252 --> 01:17:01.353]  Let's go back to the calls.
[01:17:01.813 --> 01:17:05.375]  We're going to go ahead and go to Washington now.
[01:17:06.356 --> 01:17:07.477]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeff.
[01:17:07.517 --> 01:17:07.997]  Hello, Jeff.
[01:17:08.757 --> 01:17:09.358]  Morning, Alex.
[01:17:09.698 --> 01:17:10.159]  How you doing?
[01:17:10.419 --> 01:17:10.980]  Not too bad.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:11.500]  How's yourself?
[01:17:11.721 --> 01:17:12.101]  Pretty good.
[01:17:12.882 --> 01:17:21.492]  You know, you keep bringing this up about the chips in Walmart, and of course, you being a Christian man, you know what the end result is.
[01:17:21.552 --> 01:17:25.777]  We will either take a chip or we'll be hunted down like dogs.
[01:17:26.718 --> 01:17:26.959]  I mean...
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:43.036]  I try to wake people up on this, but you have to realize that what is going to happen is going to happen, and the Bible flat states that the one world government will do this to us.
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:45.061]  I mean, it's in there.
[01:17:45.361 --> 01:17:53.650]  So I guess we'll just take the chips, and Pat Robertson says it's good, and they'll tell us Jesus has come back and runs the world now.
[01:17:53.770 --> 01:17:55.491]  Absolutely, that's what they're going to do.
[01:17:55.632 --> 01:17:58.595]  Yeah, and he's our new leader, and he's going to stop the war.
[01:17:58.835 --> 01:18:04.421]  He'll be able to bring fire from heaven off the harp or whatever, and make it look real good.
[01:18:05.692 --> 01:18:12.914]  You know, no matter how much you wake people up, you know how many people that I try to show this to that know that there's something wrong?
[01:18:12.934 --> 01:18:21.117]  I mean, the real player videos that are on the internet of World Trade Center falling straight down, number seven, I mean, that's classic demolition.
[01:18:21.157 --> 01:18:22.817]  Center first and both sides collapse.
[01:18:22.857 --> 01:18:23.718]  I mean, come on.
[01:18:24.058 --> 01:18:26.519]  You don't get that from a fire in the basement.
[01:18:27.987 --> 01:18:38.224]  But people, I show it to them, and they just shrug their shoulders because they have so much problems in their life already, they don't want to know the truth.
[01:18:38.669 --> 01:18:43.431]  Well, now we've got the owners saying they blew it up and people go, well, I guess that's good then.
[01:18:43.751 --> 01:18:45.331]  Hey, I was at the Randy Weaver siege.
[01:18:45.591 --> 01:18:48.392]  I was there standing on the front line when they shot Thickey.
[01:18:48.692 --> 01:18:52.533]  I took Bo Grites to the bridge when he went up and got Randy Weaver out.
[01:18:52.854 --> 01:18:57.495]  And the people of Boundary County, Idaho shrugged their shoulders and went, oh, well.
[01:18:57.755 --> 01:19:05.077]  And then when the Clinton administration seen they could get away with that, here comes Waco, here comes Oklahoma City, bang-a-da-boom-da-bam, right down the line.
[01:19:06.018 --> 01:19:06.198]  I mean...
[01:19:07.341 --> 01:19:07.941]  But what do we do?
[01:19:07.981 --> 01:19:09.262]  They've got a stranglehold on us.
[01:19:09.543 --> 01:19:13.245]  If we get too cocky, they'll tank this economy and starve us.
[01:19:13.265 --> 01:19:14.586]  I mean, they are already.
[01:19:14.626 --> 01:19:18.328]  Well, I guess we better just submit to tyranny, and then maybe they'll be nice to us.
[01:19:18.869 --> 01:19:19.369]  Oh, no.
[01:19:19.409 --> 01:19:20.290]  You know better than that.
[01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:21.290]  Well, let me just say this.
[01:19:21.410 --> 01:19:22.311]  They're going to kill you.
[01:19:22.351 --> 01:19:23.212]  Sir, let me just say this.
[01:19:24.492 --> 01:19:25.533]  Well, if they kill me, that's fine.
[01:19:25.853 --> 01:19:30.837]  No, I mean, if you don't take the chip, it says right there in the Bible, they will kill you.
[01:19:30.897 --> 01:19:33.838]  And I know you're not going to take no chip, neither am I. What's going to happen is...
[01:19:35.245 --> 01:19:45.871]  What's going to happen is, you know, the different sellouts out there are going to get on television, the Christian leaders, and say, oh, it's not bad.
[01:19:45.931 --> 01:19:46.751]  Go ahead and do it.
[01:19:48.052 --> 01:19:48.933]  Go ahead and do it.
[01:19:48.953 --> 01:19:49.693]  It's a good thing.
[01:19:50.293 --> 01:19:51.154]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:53.580]  We're good to go.
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:53.780]  I think?
[01:20:14.155 --> 01:20:21.041]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:20:21.081 --> 01:20:23.403]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:20:41.357 --> 01:20:45.359]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:48.281]  Call now and get free shipping.
[01:20:48.361 --> 01:20:50.783]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:20:52.604 --> 01:20:55.425]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[01:20:55.545 --> 01:20:56.386]  Michael Trudeau here.
[01:20:56.526 --> 01:20:59.808]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[01:21:00.008 --> 01:21:05.671]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[01:21:05.791 --> 01:21:08.833]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[01:21:09.073 --> 01:21:13.356]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[01:21:13.556 --> 01:21:15.457]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[01:21:15.577 --> 01:21:22.642]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[01:21:22.822 --> 01:21:25.304]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[01:21:25.584 --> 01:21:29.907]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice, only this time it changed my life.
[01:21:30.207 --> 01:21:31.948]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement.
[01:21:32.048 --> 01:21:34.169]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[01:21:34.329 --> 01:21:36.790]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:39.532]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[01:21:39.692 --> 01:21:40.252]  Side effects?
[01:21:40.432 --> 01:21:42.694]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[01:21:42.854 --> 01:21:44.135]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[01:21:44.175 --> 01:21:44.375]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[01:21:44.395 --> 01:21:45.595]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[01:21:45.615 --> 01:21:46.356]  It worked for me.
[01:21:53.973 --> 01:21:55.754]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[01:21:56.254 --> 01:21:59.675]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[01:22:00.175 --> 01:22:00.855]  Let's update.
[01:22:01.355 --> 01:22:04.816]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[01:22:05.476 --> 01:22:09.197]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[01:22:09.878 --> 01:22:10.818]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[01:22:10.858 --> 01:22:13.158]  dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[01:22:13.699 --> 01:22:14.599]  Today, the U.S.
[01:22:14.619 --> 01:22:16.839]  dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:18.780]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:21.321]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283%.
[01:22:22.679 --> 01:22:23.680]  We're good to go.
[01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:23.860]  I think?
[01:22:52.367 --> 01:22:55.309]  Americans, get the IRS off your back legally.
[01:22:55.490 --> 01:22:58.432]  Discover the secret the IRS is terrified you'll learn.
[01:22:58.692 --> 01:23:01.975]  You probably owe no federal income tax and never have.
[01:23:02.335 --> 01:23:09.441]  The IRS itself admits that millions and millions of Americans already have learned the truth and have dropped out of the system, and so can you.
[01:23:09.661 --> 01:23:11.322]  The federal courts and even the U.S.
[01:23:11.362 --> 01:23:19.769]  Supreme Court have verified that the reward for your labor, wages, salaries, and compensation for personal services is not and never has been taxable.
[01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:29.354]  In fact, the Supreme Court ruled over 106 years ago that such attacks imposed by the federal government on the citizens of the states would be unconstitutional and illegal.
[01:23:29.654 --> 01:23:31.395]  I know this sounds crazy and scary.
[01:23:31.495 --> 01:23:34.577]  You've been carefully trained by government propaganda for decades.
[01:23:34.737 --> 01:23:43.702]  But especially today with a tough economy, why would you let the government continue to illegally grab money from you when there's a simple, proven, and legal way to keep it all yourself?
[01:23:44.582 --> 01:23:45.742]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:23:45.762 --> 01:23:47.323]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:47.523 --> 01:24:01.567]  Alright, coming up in the next segment, I will play all the clips we've got concerning Building 7 one more time.
[01:24:15.029 --> 01:24:17.930]  At least for the next few weeks and recap what happened there.
[01:24:18.991 --> 01:24:21.232]  And then I'm going to get into illegal immigration to U.S.
[01:24:21.272 --> 01:24:24.253]  grew by nearly 70% in the last 12 years.
[01:24:25.574 --> 01:24:28.915]  I want to go over criminal aliens abound in the U.S.
[01:24:28.935 --> 01:24:31.496]  from the Washington Times, how they are the crime wave.
[01:24:32.977 --> 01:24:40.520]  Then World Net Daily, chiefs of police, border security, a sham organization claims lax federal policies causing murder of cops.
[01:24:41.121 --> 01:24:44.242]  Oh, I just so happen to have the numbers here from the Washington Times, federal numbers.
[01:24:45.325 --> 01:24:49.646]  Did you know that over a third of the cops being killed are being killed by illegal aliens?
[01:24:50.886 --> 01:24:51.306]  Cops?
[01:24:51.406 --> 01:24:52.967]  I don't care what your superiors tell you.
[01:24:52.987 --> 01:24:54.767]  You need to get these criminals off the streets.
[01:24:56.368 --> 01:25:02.089]  Also, we'll get into Planned Parenthood moves to shut down pro-life firm.
[01:25:03.569 --> 01:25:05.050]  And a lot more, my friends.
[01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:14.072]  I want to get back into the Bushes and the Bin Ladens as well and some more on the Dean camp and what John Kerry's up to in the New Hampshire area
[01:25:15.015 --> 01:25:16.677]  Primary that's going on right now.
[01:25:17.577 --> 01:25:21.220]  But right now, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:25:21.641 --> 01:25:22.601]  Oh, you know what?
[01:25:22.801 --> 01:25:36.272]  We're going to go to Joe and Brock and Roger and Joel and Eric and others here in a few minutes because during the break I was thinking about what Jeff and Washington was saying.
[01:25:36.312 --> 01:25:38.874]  And Jeff, I know it's of great concern.
[01:25:38.934 --> 01:25:44.039]  It's horrible for those of us that can see what's happening to witness all of this.
[01:25:44.219 --> 01:25:44.399]  But
[01:25:45.666 --> 01:25:47.567]  Let's take it from a biblical perspective.
[01:25:48.147 --> 01:26:01.754]  This world government, the RFID chips, the applied digital chips, which, by the way, a former top Reagan administration official is now going to be heading up that company, and it's really owned by IBM and the Communist Chinese military.
[01:26:02.394 --> 01:26:05.335]  I told you that four years ago in the 2002 filings.
[01:26:05.435 --> 01:26:07.156]  It's now been public last year.
[01:26:07.816 --> 01:26:13.279]  The big chip manufacturing plant in Beijing, owned by the military, but
[01:26:14.998 --> 01:26:28.606]  This is all very daunting, but time and time again, prophets were sent to Israel, and God would say, repent, get out of the wickedness, stop doing what you're doing, or I'm going to remove the protection from you, and I'm going to allow you to be enslaved.
[01:26:29.969 --> 01:26:30.869]  You reap what you sow.
[01:26:30.929 --> 01:26:31.570]  It's real simple.
[01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:46.796]  If we get involved, say no, boycott the customer loyalty cards and the RFID chips and the driver's license with the biometrics in it, if we say no to that, and most Americans are against it, by the way, in major polls.
[01:26:46.836 --> 01:26:47.717]  We have the majority.
[01:26:48.217 --> 01:26:51.458]  If we'll just move against it, they won't be able to implement it.
[01:26:53.419 --> 01:26:55.120]  And so we can get a reprieve.
[01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:57.721]  We don't have to let them have their antichrist system.
[01:26:58.996 --> 01:27:03.119]  And even if you're an atheist out there, I mean, you're not for the matrix system, are you?
[01:27:03.539 --> 01:27:12.225]  For everything you buy and sell, everything you do, who your renter is, how much money you got in the bank, when you go on vacation, what type of books you read.
[01:27:12.305 --> 01:27:15.487]  I mean, is that something that the state should be collecting for the feds?
[01:27:16.667 --> 01:27:17.588]  Obviously not.
[01:27:19.689 --> 01:27:25.033]  So, I mean, look, they wanted to forcibly inoculate the police and firefighters and medical workers.
[01:27:26.991 --> 01:27:28.031]  99 plus percent said no.
[01:27:28.551 --> 01:27:32.772]  They were then planning to make them go out and give us shots, but their own enforcers won't do it.
[01:27:33.072 --> 01:27:33.852]  What are they going to do?
[01:27:35.493 --> 01:27:38.633]  You know, they tried to have Henry Kissinger as the head of the 9-11 Whitewash Commission.
[01:27:38.673 --> 01:27:39.473]  Nobody bought that.
[01:27:40.414 --> 01:27:43.834]  All this corruption's coming out, but again, no one's being held accountable.
[01:27:44.654 --> 01:27:47.515]  At the bare minimum, we can passively not go along with this.
[01:27:47.575 --> 01:27:48.295]  Let me tell you something.
[01:27:48.575 --> 01:27:51.876]  Don't use the self-checkout lanes.
[01:27:52.636 --> 01:27:53.156]  Demand.
[01:27:54.095 --> 01:27:57.057]  That you'd be able to use the full service lanes.
[01:27:57.137 --> 01:28:00.899]  And when they just get rid of those and say, we don't care, go to the mom and pops.
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:02.660]  Go to the junk shops.
[01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:03.561]  Do whatever you have to.
[01:28:03.601 --> 01:28:04.802]  Stop buying their garbage.
[01:28:05.782 --> 01:28:10.205]  Don't let them put in those self-checkout lanes because then the thumb scanners go in, which has now happened.
[01:28:10.245 --> 01:28:11.165]  It is happening right now.
[01:28:11.666 --> 01:28:13.887]  Then they phase out all the checkout lanes that are serviced.
[01:28:13.907 --> 01:28:14.908]  Then they make you do that.
[01:28:15.128 --> 01:28:20.371]  Then they come out with a new national sales tax, which will mean federal control over every business, county, city, and state.
[01:28:21.056 --> 01:28:22.156]  And track everything you do.
[01:28:22.296 --> 01:28:23.657]  That's the national ID card.
[01:28:23.917 --> 01:28:25.597]  That's neither buy nor sell without it.
[01:28:27.138 --> 01:28:29.238]  You've got to stop their system from going in.
[01:28:29.518 --> 01:28:36.920]  If your public school makes your son or daughter thumb scan to buy and sell and keeps a record of what they eat, by the way, for CPS, say no.
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:38.441]  Go to the meetings.
[01:28:38.501 --> 01:28:39.361]  Go to the PTA.
[01:28:39.381 --> 01:28:40.141]  Go to the board.
[01:28:40.201 --> 01:28:40.641]  Say no.
[01:28:40.741 --> 01:28:41.242]  Take it out.
[01:28:41.382 --> 01:28:42.262]  No, no, no.
[01:28:43.311 --> 01:28:49.479]  They had a school in Louisiana with hundreds of children, a 5A school, and this is five years ago.
[01:28:49.499 --> 01:28:51.841]  They were making them wear ID cards with barcodes on it.
[01:28:52.262 --> 01:28:53.143]  One student said no.
[01:28:53.183 --> 01:28:53.904]  They expelled them.
[01:28:54.144 --> 01:28:55.025]  Ten students said no.
[01:28:55.045 --> 01:28:55.686]  They expelled them.
[01:28:56.066 --> 01:28:56.927]  All of them said no.
[01:28:56.948 --> 01:28:57.728]  A whole bunch of them did.
[01:28:57.748 --> 01:28:59.050]  They had to stop the program.
[01:28:59.871 --> 01:29:00.992]  Just learn to say no!
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.922]  And learn to recognize the system they're putting in place.
[01:29:05.703 --> 01:29:07.004]  And learn to see the propaganda.
[01:29:07.124 --> 01:29:14.570]  Every day, in every major publication I see, there's articles about how great biometrics are, how great RFID is, how great all this is going to be.
[01:29:15.431 --> 01:29:17.413]  You've got to educate others.
[01:29:17.733 --> 01:29:18.874]  People are against this.
[01:29:19.374 --> 01:29:21.716]  But they've got to learn how to boycott and say no.
[01:29:23.558 --> 01:29:26.360]  Folks, we destroyed Rosie O'Donnell because she was anti-gun.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:27.081]  We boycotted her.
[01:29:27.101 --> 01:29:27.641]  She's gone.
[01:29:28.282 --> 01:29:28.802]  They admit it.
[01:29:29.122 --> 01:29:29.763]  We destroyed her.
[01:29:30.842 --> 01:29:32.923]  We destroyed Kmart.
[01:29:34.063 --> 01:29:37.684]  Because they, you know, we're going to stop selling guns.
[01:29:37.724 --> 01:29:39.504]  Just learn to boycott these people.
[01:29:39.964 --> 01:29:40.524]  We'll be back.
[01:29:40.544 --> 01:29:41.925]  Stay with us.
[01:29:43.465 --> 01:29:44.385]  We're on the march.
[01:29:44.846 --> 01:29:46.486]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:46.506 --> 01:29:50.087]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:53.527 --> 01:29:57.130]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:58.772]  If so, hope has arrived.
[01:29:59.252 --> 01:30:00.693]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[01:30:00.953 --> 01:30:06.138]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[01:30:06.498 --> 01:30:10.982]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[01:30:11.302 --> 01:30:19.930]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[01:30:20.430 --> 01:30:21.571]  Gum disease is serious.
[01:30:22.051 --> 01:30:25.812]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[01:30:26.093 --> 01:30:32.715]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including vitamin toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[01:30:33.056 --> 01:30:37.097]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.
[01:30:37.518 --> 01:30:39.478]  Order yours today from Cliff Scott Enterprises.
[01:30:39.739 --> 01:30:40.519]  Call toll-free 800-569-4340.
[01:30:40.539 --> 01:30:40.859]  That's 800-569-4340.

[01:30:52.975 --> 01:30:56.877]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:30:57.097 --> 01:31:09.382]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:31:09.802 --> 01:31:10.202]  The U.S.
[01:31:10.242 --> 01:31:15.824]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:31:16.224 --> 01:31:18.425]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:31:20.306 --> 01:31:20.767]  We're good to go.
[01:31:41.150 --> 01:31:41.351]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:31:41.371 --> 01:31:41.571]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:31:52.429 --> 01:31:54.230]  Got $3 in your pocket?
[01:31:54.431 --> 01:31:57.293]  Want a million dollars in term life insurance coverage?
[01:31:57.533 --> 01:31:59.374]  Call Term Busters now.
[01:31:59.695 --> 01:32:01.056]  Rates are low right now.
[01:32:01.196 --> 01:32:02.357]  Call and compare.
[01:32:02.617 --> 01:32:13.085]  For example, a man age 45, non-tobacco user, issue preferred $1 million of coverage is only $75 a month level for the next 10 years.
[01:32:13.385 --> 01:32:15.006]  Call Term Busters now.
[01:32:15.026 --> 01:32:15.586]  We're good to go.
[01:32:37.424 --> 01:32:42.887]  Remember, $1 million in term life insurance coverage for as little as $3 a day.
[01:32:42.987 --> 01:32:44.148]  Call right now.
[01:32:44.448 --> 01:32:46.149]  Operators are standing by.
[01:32:46.169 --> 01:32:46.209]  800-430-6692.
[01:32:46.229 --> 01:32:47.029]  800-430-6692.
[01:32:47.109 --> 01:33:01.917]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:33:02.517 --> 01:33:05.479]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:09.902]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:10.502 --> 01:33:12.824]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:13.305 --> 01:33:15.406]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central.
[01:33:15.807 --> 01:33:16.888]  Back from 9 to midnight.
[01:33:17.288 --> 01:33:23.413]  Now, coming up here in just a few minutes, we'll go to Brock and Roger and Eric and David and others that are patiently holding.
[01:33:24.193 --> 01:33:27.096]  The total free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[01:33:27.676 --> 01:33:33.341]  Then I'll get into all this illegal immigration news, the latest developments, very important.
[01:33:34.577 --> 01:33:46.001]  And later, probably in the next hour, we probably won't have time to get to it in this hour, the New York Post, and it's an article about a little test that was done eating nothing but McDonald's for a month.
[01:33:46.581 --> 01:33:50.583]  A healthy person gained 25 pounds and became very ill.
[01:33:50.623 --> 01:33:51.843]  Their cholesterol rose.
[01:33:52.083 --> 01:33:53.184]  They started vomiting.
[01:33:54.424 --> 01:33:55.244]  Interesting story.
[01:33:55.445 --> 01:34:01.387]  I have quit eating fast food and started exercising again, and I've lost 20 pounds in about three weeks.
[01:34:01.407 --> 01:34:02.147]  Ha, ha, ha.
[01:34:03.366 --> 01:34:04.790]  I guess now it's almost four weeks.
[01:34:04.950 --> 01:34:07.015]  But I used to be in perfect shape.
[01:34:07.055 --> 01:34:11.044]  I could run 10 miles like that, lift weights for three hours, bench press 330-something pounds.
[01:34:13.455 --> 01:34:14.476]  And I weighed 185.
[01:34:15.137 --> 01:34:18.620]  And so I got another 20 pounds to lose, folks, to get down to 200.
[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:32.571]  I got up to 240-plus pounds because I've been working so hard, doing radio, TV, making films, stopped exercising for the fight against the New World Order until I realized it was damaging me.
[01:34:32.591 --> 01:34:35.653]  And I just said, look, I've got to be strong for this fight.
[01:34:35.673 --> 01:34:40.337]  So I'm spending about an hour a day, seven hours a week, working out again.
[01:34:41.158 --> 01:34:42.599]  But, again, that's coming up.
[01:34:44.126 --> 01:34:54.876]  Before we go to these calls, I want to go back through all of the WTC7 clips and briefly recap what really happened there for those that have missed those reports and give you some of the new developments.
[01:34:56.878 --> 01:35:04.945]  But, folks, talking about... Let me just read part of this New York Post article because this dovetails with what I'm about to do.
[01:35:06.006 --> 01:35:07.268]  New York Post yesterday.
[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:13.846]  Last February, Morgan Spurlock decided to become a gastronomical guinea pig.
[01:35:14.767 --> 01:35:19.652]  His mission, to eat three meals a day for 30 days at McDonald's and document the impact on his health.
[01:35:20.673 --> 01:35:24.297]  Scores of cheeseburgers, hundreds of fries and dozens of chocolate shakes later...
[01:35:25.143 --> 01:35:34.425]  The formerly strapping 6'2 New Yorker who started out a healthy 185 pounds had packed on 25 pounds, but his supersized shape was the least of his problems.
[01:35:34.505 --> 01:35:39.506]  In a few days of beginning the drive-thru diet, Spurlock, 33, was vomiting out the window of his car.
[01:35:39.886 --> 01:35:41.507]  This was all documented for a documentary.
[01:35:42.087 --> 01:35:45.968]  And doctors who examined him were shocked at how rapidly Spurlock's entire body deteriorated.
[01:35:46.528 --> 01:35:47.389]  It was really crazy.
[01:35:47.429 --> 01:35:51.432]  My body basically fell apart over the course of 30 days, Spurlock told the Post.
[01:35:51.892 --> 01:35:58.858]  His liver became toxic, his cholesterol shot up from 165 to 230, his libido flagged, and he suffered headaches and depression.
[01:35:59.378 --> 01:36:08.245]  Spurlock charted his journey from the fit to flab in a tongue-in-cheek documentary which he's released at the Sundance Film Festival in the hopes of getting a distribution deal.
[01:36:08.706 --> 01:36:10.087]  We'll cover more of it in the next hour.
[01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:18.145]  But that dovetails into the next five minutes with Debbie Morrow, my good friend at New Millennium Concepts.
[01:36:18.646 --> 01:36:20.227]  Not just the food, Debbie.
[01:36:21.168 --> 01:36:26.692]  What's been keeping me going all these years, I mean, I get sick maybe once a year, is that I don't drink tap water.
[01:36:29.065 --> 01:36:36.136]  Once you've been drinking out of a real filtration system, I don't mean one of the cheap ones that doesn't work, but a real filtration system, you can't drink tap water.
[01:36:36.256 --> 01:36:38.039]  It tastes bad.
[01:36:38.119 --> 01:36:41.424]  You go to a city that's really got bad water, it tastes like kerosene.
[01:36:41.844 --> 01:36:42.705]  Dallas or Houston.
[01:36:42.746 --> 01:36:44.288]  Houston's the worst I've seen around the country.
[01:36:45.204 --> 01:36:59.028]  But even Austin's, quote, good water, the chlorine, the fluoride, the dead bacteria, the herbicides, the pesticides, the motor oil, the Prozac, the Ritalin, the birth control drugs, stop drinking it!
[01:36:59.128 --> 01:37:00.148]  Stop being part of it!
[01:37:00.208 --> 01:37:03.949]  And I don't know of what I can say or do to convince listeners of this show.
[01:37:04.509 --> 01:37:10.233]  Who I know, who I see on the street, people that watch the show, listen to the show, still drinking tap water.
[01:37:10.473 --> 01:37:11.394]  I will not do it.
[01:37:11.854 --> 01:37:17.738]  Did you know that if I drink a glass of tap water in the morning, say when I'm in a hotel or something, I mean, it really makes me feel like I'm going to get sick.
[01:37:17.758 --> 01:37:18.459]  I won't even think about it.
[01:37:18.479 --> 01:37:21.201]  I'll toss it back and ugh, this feels weird in your stomach.
[01:37:21.481 --> 01:37:24.903]  You can drink gallons of clean water and it's so good for you.
[01:37:25.124 --> 01:37:28.426]  It's just as important as not eating fast food.
[01:37:29.741 --> 01:37:33.423]  Now, I've got to tell you, I've eaten fast food that doesn't make me feel sick like McDonald's does.
[01:37:33.803 --> 01:37:36.805]  I'd eat at McDonald's and just a few hours later just feel horrible.
[01:37:37.865 --> 01:37:42.247]  But again, your body is a temple, folks, and stop crashing it.
[01:37:42.668 --> 01:37:44.769]  Why would you drink all these poisons and toxins?
[01:37:44.809 --> 01:37:47.650]  And there's hundreds of stories and documents, and it's admitted.
[01:37:48.211 --> 01:37:49.831]  Debbie, you've got some specials for us.
[01:37:50.031 --> 01:37:52.553]  How do folks get involved and stop drinking poison?
[01:37:53.373 --> 01:37:55.894]  I do have some specials, Alex.
[01:37:56.355 --> 01:37:58.596]  They get involved by calling me.
[01:37:59.568 --> 01:38:03.670]  On our toll-free number, which is 1-888-803-4438.
[01:38:06.152 --> 01:38:12.996]  And we have January specials that will provide them with a Berkey light for $259.
[01:38:13.036 --> 01:38:19.799]  And with that, they get two filtered sport bottles to take with them on the go.
[01:38:19.899 --> 01:38:26.023]  So when they do go to work or to activities that they're away from their Berkey, they
[01:38:26.502 --> 01:38:30.065]  They can still have good filtered water while they're out and about.
[01:38:30.505 --> 01:38:38.152]  It doesn't do quite the same as the Berkey, but at least it's going to get out your pathogens, your herbicides, things like that.
[01:38:38.953 --> 01:38:43.156]  That special is a $337 value for $259.
[01:38:43.196 --> 01:38:45.999]  Now what do you get for that?
[01:38:46.399 --> 01:38:50.923]  You get the Berkey light with the lights, and that comes with the black purification elements.
[01:38:51.443 --> 01:38:53.185]  The black purification elements...
[01:38:54.216 --> 01:38:56.921]  Take out our pathogenic bacteria.
[01:38:57.022 --> 01:38:59.587]  This is a top-of-the-line system.
[01:38:59.787 --> 01:39:00.428]  Absolutely.
[01:39:00.528 --> 01:39:01.891]  What else do they get?
[01:39:01.931 --> 01:39:05.137]  They also get two filtered Berkey support bottles with it.
[01:39:05.658 --> 01:39:09.059]  All right, and by the way, you're the big sponsor for the International Shortwave.
[01:39:09.539 --> 01:39:10.919]  This stuff's made in America.
[01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:13.080]  I know a negative for most people.
[01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:13.940]  It's made in America.
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:14.661]  We're sorry.
[01:39:14.701 --> 01:39:15.461]  We apologize.
[01:39:16.181 --> 01:39:17.601]  It's an extreme rarity.
[01:39:18.101 --> 01:39:27.424]  It's made in America, and at the same time, it's the top-of-the-line system, and it supports this broadcast, and you're getting it from the maker or the distributor, so you get a better price.
[01:39:27.764 --> 01:39:29.145]  You guys also have a $150 deal, don't you?
[01:39:31.105 --> 01:39:31.705]  Yes, we do.
[01:39:31.785 --> 01:39:32.525]  We have $159.
[01:39:32.685 --> 01:39:38.547]  It's the Berkey Light Canister.
[01:39:38.747 --> 01:39:45.609]  It's our Lexan canister, but it comes with the British Burkefield Ceramic Imperial Filters.
[01:39:45.969 --> 01:39:48.529]  Which are excellent as well.
[01:39:48.669 --> 01:39:50.450]  $159, and what else do they get when they buy that?
[01:39:50.930 --> 01:39:51.330]  That's it.
[01:39:51.690 --> 01:39:52.030]  Okay.
[01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:53.570]  They get that because that's a $200 value in itself.
[01:39:56.571 --> 01:39:58.031]  And we want to make it affordable.
[01:39:59.032 --> 01:40:03.313]  How many gallons will both these units do before the filters have to be replaced?
[01:40:04.273 --> 01:40:13.336]  The Berkey Light with the black purification elements will do approximately 4,000 gallons before you need to change out the filters.
[01:40:13.396 --> 01:40:19.698]  An average family, if they did four gallons a day, that would be two years and seven months of pure water.
[01:40:20.098 --> 01:40:22.719]  Now understand, a lot of you buy bottled water.
[01:40:23.299 --> 01:40:26.100]  Statistics show that much of that is dirtier than tap water.
[01:40:26.821 --> 01:40:32.426]  And again, you can just type in, you know, bottled water dangerous, and every AP report you can imagine will pop up.
[01:40:33.247 --> 01:40:35.970]  Dan and Water killed some folks in New York three years ago.
[01:40:36.010 --> 01:40:37.631]  I mean, that's on the news.
[01:40:38.232 --> 01:40:39.853]  So you'll save money.
[01:40:39.893 --> 01:40:43.397]  Just with the sports filters, getting the sports filters, folks.
[01:40:44.097 --> 01:40:49.883]  You know, these guys really clean your water up, and they do, what, 600 refills.
[01:40:50.864 --> 01:40:55.248]  So that will save you hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars right there.
[01:40:55.589 --> 01:40:57.931]  In fact, you do have a deal on sports bottles, too, don't you?
[01:40:58.271 --> 01:40:58.892]  Yes, we do.
[01:40:58.932 --> 01:41:03.176]  We have five of the generic labeled Berkey Sport bottles for $100, or $99.
[01:41:06.417 --> 01:41:08.479]  Or we have 12 for $199.
[01:41:08.659 --> 01:41:14.263]  Now, again, if you try to go to a camping supply place, $35, $40 for one of these.
[01:41:14.644 --> 01:41:19.267]  They have a smaller element, because I bought these in the past going camping, and that's better than nothing.
[01:41:19.728 --> 01:41:23.591]  The filters you've got, the sports bottles, that is a big element in there.
[01:41:23.611 --> 01:41:27.093]  I mean, it's got to be three times the size of other units I've seen out there.
[01:41:27.674 --> 01:41:29.555]  It is a really good filter.
[01:41:29.856 --> 01:41:31.036]  It lasts a long time.
[01:41:31.477 --> 01:41:32.898]  My husband and I use them frequently.
[01:41:33.391 --> 01:41:36.816]  And we'll go a year or more before we have to change out a bottle.
[01:41:36.876 --> 01:41:38.758]  Now that's 600 refills on tap water.
[01:41:38.818 --> 01:41:40.761]  How many refills on pond water?
[01:41:41.182 --> 01:41:46.409]  If you do pond or lake water, it does approximately 160 refills.
[01:41:46.709 --> 01:41:48.151]  Okay folks, you need to get these
[01:41:48.311 --> 01:41:49.411]  Great gifts for family.
[01:41:49.811 --> 01:41:53.393]  And yes, it makes this show or international outreach possible.
[01:41:53.753 --> 01:41:55.713]  So you're killing two birds with one stone here.
[01:41:56.053 --> 01:41:56.834]  Well, three birds.
[01:41:56.894 --> 01:41:57.954]  It's also made in America.
[01:41:58.334 --> 01:41:59.474]  Here's the toll-free number.
[01:41:59.534 --> 01:42:00.315]  Call right now.
[01:42:00.355 --> 01:42:01.575]  And if it's busy, leave your name and number.
[01:42:01.595 --> 01:42:02.495]  Debbie will call you right back.
[01:42:02.515 --> 01:42:02.555]  1-888-
[01:42:04.616 --> 01:42:05.657]  803-4438.
[01:42:05.677 --> 01:42:06.657]  888-803-4438.
[01:42:06.677 --> 01:42:12.882]  Debbie, thank you so much for coming on.
[01:42:12.902 --> 01:42:13.783]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:42:13.943 --> 01:42:14.283]  You bet.
[01:42:14.303 --> 01:42:21.048]  And we also have the same specials at InfoWars.com, and my staff gives her the orders every day.
[01:42:22.062 --> 01:42:22.903]  We're good to go.
[01:42:22.943 --> 01:42:23.643]  We're good to go.
[01:42:42.976 --> 01:42:48.620]  For six hours a day of Global Shortwave Show, it's very important to support us in what we're doing.
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:49.761]  888-803-4438.
[01:42:50.781 --> 01:42:52.903]  Okay, I know we've got loaded phone lines.
[01:42:53.183 --> 01:42:54.704]  I know we've got a lot of news I want to get to.
[01:42:56.025 --> 01:42:56.725]  And we're going to.
[01:42:56.865 --> 01:42:59.967]  But I want to spend five minutes on WTC7.
[01:43:00.127 --> 01:43:04.891]  And let me attempt to just boil this down to the simplicity of what happened.
[01:43:05.431 --> 01:43:09.934]  Sometimes the simplest things are hard for some under globalist mind control to understand.
[01:43:11.283 --> 01:43:14.664]  There were seven buildings in the World Trade Center complex.
[01:43:16.304 --> 01:43:18.944]  One, two, three, four, five, six, and seven.
[01:43:20.725 --> 01:43:38.208]  On September 11, 2001, two buildings in the mid-morning were hit, Tower 1 and Tower 2, the 110-story buildings, the North and South Towers, Tower 1 and 2, were hit by jet aircraft, passenger jet aircraft.
[01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:40.561]  That's on the record.
[01:44:03.202 --> 01:44:08.086]  Suddenly, explosions went off down the sides of the buildings, which we have still photos of on Fox News.
[01:44:08.386 --> 01:44:12.769]  The popcorn-type explosions you see and a hundred other demolitions you've witnessed on television.
[01:44:13.590 --> 01:44:14.650]  The buildings collapse.
[01:44:15.411 --> 01:44:18.873]  The seismographs pick up the classic signature of controlled demolitions.
[01:44:20.374 --> 01:44:26.979]  And then, later that afternoon, a fire starts at Building 7, a 47-story building, the furthest away from all the other six buildings.
[01:44:27.799 --> 01:44:27.979]  I think.
[01:44:56.747 --> 01:44:58.448]  That's Rudolph Giuliani, ABC News.
[01:44:58.488 --> 01:45:02.751]  How did they know 1 and 2 were going to collapse when it was an unprecedented event?
[01:45:03.032 --> 01:45:08.255]  Suddenly Giuliani comes out and says, Oh yeah, we got the call to get out because 1 and 2 were going to collapse and maybe 7.
[01:45:09.656 --> 01:45:12.218]  Then a few hours later, Building 7 catches fire.
[01:45:12.598 --> 01:45:14.420]  Small fire, 7th and 12th floor.
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:16.241]  Firefighters said they can contain it.
[01:45:16.261 --> 01:45:22.005]  Then suddenly ABC News announces on the radio, I heard it, they may demolish the building so it doesn't spread fires.
[01:45:23.266 --> 01:45:24.587]  Then at 4.35 in the afternoon,
[01:45:27.270 --> 01:45:41.151]  The building falls in 3.2 seconds, with explosions going off down the sides, implodes in on itself, only the most skilled demolitions can do that, so it doesn't damage surrounding buildings, and it collapsed.
[01:45:42.003 --> 01:45:44.164]  And the seismographs picked up the multiple explosions.
[01:45:44.224 --> 01:45:48.927]  Firefighters told the AP, oh, yeah, we were told to get back, that we were about to bring it down.
[01:45:49.327 --> 01:45:50.668]  That all happened at the time.
[01:45:51.088 --> 01:45:57.112]  I reported on that in Road to Tyranny and Masters of Terror in my book, Descent into Tyranny, over the last two-plus years.
[01:45:58.512 --> 01:46:06.557]  Now it comes out that on a PBS documentary, the owner of the World Trade Center complex, the leaseholder, Larry Silverstein,
[01:46:07.719 --> 01:46:15.895]  In a documentary about the clearing and rebuilding, they're talking about in the film how they cleared the site, what they're going to rebuild there.
[01:46:17.017 --> 01:46:29.728]  They go back to the day of September 11th, and Silverstein goes, yeah, the building was on fire, and we had such a loss of life that we talked about it, the decision to pull it, and they made the decision, so we gave the order to pull it, and then we watched it collapse.
[01:46:30.328 --> 01:46:31.189]  Then we air the clip.
[01:46:31.209 --> 01:46:32.330]  We're in the same documentary.
[01:46:32.370 --> 01:46:39.075]  A city official talks about in December, two and a half months later, how they blew up four, five, and six.
[01:46:39.095 --> 01:46:44.700]  Remember, the wreckage of those buildings to clear the site uses the word pull it for demolition.
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:45.861]  It's clear.
[01:46:46.261 --> 01:46:46.802]  It's public.
[01:46:47.062 --> 01:46:47.823]  It's out in the open.
[01:46:47.843 --> 01:46:49.084]  Here are the two sub-questions.
[01:46:49.304 --> 01:46:51.466]  Then we'll air the clips, go to your calls, and cover more news.
[01:46:53.168 --> 01:46:56.992]  It takes days, if not weeks, to plant explosives properly to bring down a building.
[01:46:57.613 --> 01:47:03.058]  One out of ten modern buildings they try to control demolition, to demolish, with explosives.
[01:47:03.078 --> 01:47:05.621]  One out of ten, this is the official number, does not collapse.
[01:47:05.641 --> 01:47:07.422]  They have to go back in and plant more explosives.
[01:47:07.462 --> 01:47:08.984]  This is when they spend weeks doing it.
[01:47:11.087 --> 01:47:19.632]  So on 9-11, we're to believe they went in and put explosives in a building, which they now admit they blew up, in just a few hours when it was on fire.
[01:47:20.773 --> 01:47:21.954]  Then there's the second question.
[01:47:22.574 --> 01:47:24.275]  Why hasn't this been publicly admitted?
[01:47:24.335 --> 01:47:30.839]  Why did FEMA deny what the firefighters and seismographs have said and said, no, it collapsed because of the fire?
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:34.201]  So there's a cover up there.
[01:47:35.021 --> 01:47:36.322]  Okay, let's go to the first clip.
[01:47:36.362 --> 01:47:38.483]  This is from the PBS documentary, America Rebuilding.
[01:47:38.864 --> 01:47:39.544]  Go ahead and hit that.
[01:47:42.398 --> 01:47:46.840]  World Trade Center 7 had always been considered the starting point for rebuilding.
[01:47:48.701 --> 01:47:56.605]  Located north of the slurry wall, 7 had been cleared faster than the rest of the site, and there had been no bodies to recover.
[01:47:57.586 --> 01:48:09.072]  Pelted by debris when the North Tower collapsed, 7 burned until late afternoon, allowing occupants to evacuate to safety.
[01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:16.595]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[01:48:16.615 --> 01:48:20.218]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[01:48:20.238 --> 01:48:22.319]  Maybe this is what I was thinking.
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:24.561]  There's a poet.
[01:48:24.621 --> 01:48:26.162]  And they made that decision to pull.
[01:48:26.543 --> 01:48:28.784]  And then we watched the building collapse.
[01:48:28.905 --> 01:48:31.006]  And they show Building 7 collapse.
[01:48:33.763 --> 01:48:35.164]  We've called Silverstein's office.
[01:48:35.264 --> 01:48:37.225]  Others have no comment, won't talk to us.
[01:48:38.426 --> 01:48:39.566]  Now, here's the next clip.
[01:48:39.626 --> 01:48:40.267]  Dan Rather.
[01:48:40.587 --> 01:48:42.708]  This is about 30 seconds after collapse.
[01:48:42.748 --> 01:48:45.349]  They back up the tape and go, now let's show that collapse again.
[01:48:46.090 --> 01:48:51.252]  And here's Dan Rather about actually 45 seconds after Building 7 collapses at 4.35 p.m.
[01:48:51.493 --> 01:48:54.034]  This is what Dan Rather had to say live on the spot.
[01:48:54.094 --> 01:48:54.374]  Here it is.
[01:48:54.394 --> 01:48:56.075]  What you're seeing are high shots, Steve.
[01:48:57.811 --> 01:49:00.933]  Now, here we're going to show you a videotape of the collapse itself.
[01:49:01.754 --> 01:49:03.875]  Now we go to videotape the collapse of this building.
[01:49:08.558 --> 01:49:09.319]  It's amazing.
[01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:12.701]  Amazing, incredible, pick your word.
[01:49:13.642 --> 01:49:24.449]  For the third time today, it's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[01:49:25.922 --> 01:49:31.387]  Okay, and we also on the website have Peter Jennings talking to a reporter, and the reporter says, you know, looks like bombs.
[01:49:31.867 --> 01:49:33.308]  The firefighters reported bombs.
[01:49:33.328 --> 01:49:35.710]  They were carrying cops out going, bombs, bombs.
[01:49:36.611 --> 01:49:40.013]  But again, we had always said they blew all three of the buildings up that day.
[01:49:40.294 --> 01:49:42.575]  We have the seismographs, the witnesses, the firefighters.
[01:49:42.976 --> 01:49:44.157]  Now we've got the owner.
[01:49:45.234 --> 01:49:46.675]  Saying they blew up WTC 7.
[01:49:46.775 --> 01:49:55.423]  When we come back, we will define pull for you when they talk about two and a half months later blowing up 4, 5, and 6, calling it pulling the building.
[01:49:55.823 --> 01:50:01.168]  And then we'll go to Brock and Roger and Eric and David and others.
[01:50:01.208 --> 01:50:02.969]  I appreciate you guys holding.
[01:50:02.989 --> 01:50:06.793]  Then I'll get into all the immigration news, more on the Bushes and the Bin Ladens.
[01:50:07.649 --> 01:50:10.390]  And we'll get into this fast food diet, what that's doing.
[01:50:10.770 --> 01:50:14.890]  Ashcroft, war justified even without Iraq having weapons of mass destruction.
[01:50:14.910 --> 01:50:17.871]  We'll talk about Arnold getting ready for a big tax increase.
[01:50:19.031 --> 01:50:20.231]  And a lot more.
[01:50:20.371 --> 01:50:23.092]  Italy and their new fascist leader getting rid of free speech in Italy.
[01:50:23.652 --> 01:50:25.312]  Just like we're doing here in this country.
[01:50:26.652 --> 01:50:28.673]  And more in the casual society control grid.
[01:50:28.693 --> 01:50:30.313]  There's so much I want to go over today.
[01:50:30.333 --> 01:50:34.534]  But first, we'll go to calls until the oldest callers that have been holding there the longest.
[01:50:35.254 --> 01:50:36.434]  Until we get to you.
[01:50:37.452 --> 01:50:38.093]  So stay with us.
[01:50:38.113 --> 01:50:44.759]  And if you want to read the full report about WTC7, go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:50:45.060 --> 01:50:48.924]  And Paul Watson is doing an update with some new developments at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:50:48.944 --> 01:50:50.085]  Concerning this, we'll be right back.
[01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:57.547]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:57.747 --> 01:51:02.174]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:51:02.314 --> 01:51:06.681]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:51:06.741 --> 01:51:08.083]  The New World Order.
[01:51:09.864 --> 01:51:14.065]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:51:14.145 --> 01:51:21.066]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:51:21.186 --> 01:51:23.247]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:51:23.587 --> 01:51:33.909]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:51:34.209 --> 01:51:35.469]  If you want to understand what the new
[01:51:35.549 --> 01:51:37.010]  Order today and spread the word.

[01:53:48.114 --> 01:54:05.997]  Now, folks, we aired this clip from the PBS documentary, America Rebuilding,
[01:54:06.843 --> 01:54:14.266]  To make it clear what the word pull, pulling a building, then watching it collapse, that that's the industry term for controlled demolition.
[01:54:15.486 --> 01:54:16.907]  Okay?
[01:54:16.927 --> 01:54:25.069]  And some people watch this and go, oh, okay, well, Building 7, Silverstein's talking about December and the admitted controlled demolition of 4, 5, and 6.
[01:54:25.110 --> 01:54:25.150]  No!
[01:54:27.663 --> 01:54:31.526]  No, he's talking about Building 7, they say Building 7, on 9-11.
[01:54:31.546 --> 01:54:35.149]  Then later they admittedly demolished the rest of the site.
[01:54:35.169 --> 01:54:35.590]  Remember that?
[01:54:35.890 --> 01:54:40.594]  We're just playing this clip to understand what the word pull it, the term pull it, means.
[01:54:40.634 --> 01:54:41.555]  Go ahead and hit that clip.
[01:54:41.975 --> 01:54:48.461]  By mid-December, the Department of Design and Construction had leveled World Trade Center buildings 4 and 5.
[01:54:48.541 --> 01:54:52.284]  Hello?
[01:54:54.125 --> 01:54:55.507]  Oh, we're getting ready to pull Building 6.
[01:54:58.550 --> 01:55:00.933]  We had to be very careful how we demolished Building 6.
[01:55:01.013 --> 01:55:09.923]  We were worried about the Building 6 coming down and then damaging the red slurry wall, so we wanted that particular building to fall within a certain area.
[01:55:14.368 --> 01:55:14.788]  Okay.
[01:55:15.569 --> 01:55:16.831]  Alright, we're about to go to your calls.
[01:55:16.891 --> 01:55:18.813]  I just want to briefly tell folks that...
[01:55:20.035 --> 01:55:25.103]  Having millions of people watch these clips at Infowars.com has been very expensive server-wise.
[01:55:25.143 --> 01:55:32.755]  I've had to add another smoking server, the latest, the best design, just so millions of you can go watch this for free.
[01:55:33.815 --> 01:55:40.637]  I would suggest, folks, if you want to see this show expanded and the websites expanded and bringing more and more, to get my videos.

[01:55:42.217 --> 01:55:42.998]  I've published a book.
[01:55:43.378 --> 01:55:45.058]  I carry books on tape concerning 9-11.
[01:55:45.438 --> 01:55:46.719]  I carry other publications.

[01:56:25.069 --> 01:56:26.109]  Okay, let's go to Brock in Canada.
[01:56:26.129 --> 01:56:27.030]  Brock, thanks for holding.
[01:56:27.050 --> 01:56:27.430]  Go ahead.
[01:56:37.443 --> 01:56:38.163]  Hello, Alex.
[01:56:38.263 --> 01:56:41.024]  You're doing a tremendous job.
[01:56:41.284 --> 01:56:51.887]  I think that the caller from Washington and you brought up a fabulous point that I want to hammer home.
[01:56:52.607 --> 01:56:58.109]  That is that there are fake Christian leaders who are going to...
[01:56:59.437 --> 01:57:05.622]  Team up with the horror church, Mystery Babylon, and say, oh, it's all right to take the mark.
[01:57:05.822 --> 01:57:06.943]  Don't worry about it.
[01:57:07.123 --> 01:57:08.764]  The Patriot Act's good.
[01:57:09.105 --> 01:57:10.746]  Homeland Security's good.
[01:57:11.066 --> 01:57:12.628]  National ID cards are good.
[01:57:12.648 --> 01:57:13.788]  They're suddenly saying this.
[01:57:14.289 --> 01:57:24.337]  Yeah, and what I was going to suggest is just expose them, you know, right on this show and so that people won't send them money and that they'll,
[01:57:25.069 --> 01:57:25.389]  Well, sir, sir.
[01:57:48.979 --> 01:57:54.961]  Thousands of public schools, hundreds and hundreds of grocery stores, thousands of check-cashing facilities.
[01:57:55.301 --> 01:57:56.121]  I have the AP.
[01:57:56.181 --> 01:57:58.161]  It's going in everywhere now.
[01:57:58.201 --> 01:58:00.322]  Do you have the self-checkout lanes at your area?
[01:58:00.782 --> 01:58:01.102]  No.
[01:58:01.402 --> 01:58:06.624]  I work at Safeway, which I think is Bums, you know, in the California area.
[01:58:07.124 --> 01:58:08.224]  And they're leading it.
[01:58:09.024 --> 01:58:11.825]  Well, I don't know, but I'll say this much.
[01:58:11.885 --> 01:58:16.086]  Because of the good work you're doing, I think it's going to slow up those plans.
[01:58:17.034 --> 01:58:21.438]  You know, because I do believe enough people are waking up to say, no, we refuse it.
[01:58:21.858 --> 01:58:22.499]  I refuse.
[01:58:22.599 --> 01:58:23.920]  I work at a grocery store.
[01:58:24.421 --> 01:58:27.644]  I refuse to go through anything other than a checker.
[01:58:28.905 --> 01:58:31.627]  You know, and I advise everyone else to do the same.
[01:58:32.128 --> 01:58:32.368]  I know.
[01:58:32.408 --> 01:58:33.509]  I hear these checkers going.
[01:58:33.589 --> 01:58:35.230]  I love what they're putting in the self-checkers.
[01:58:35.691 --> 01:58:37.392]  Then a month later, they're all laid off.
[01:58:38.593 --> 01:58:39.594]  Again, we'll be back.
[01:58:39.855 --> 01:58:40.395]  Great points.
[01:58:40.455 --> 01:58:41.256]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:44.830 --> 01:58:49.331]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:58:49.691 --> 01:58:53.772]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:58:54.072 --> 01:58:54.632]  We listened.
[01:58:54.932 --> 01:58:59.913]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:59:00.193 --> 01:59:00.673]  We listened.
[01:59:01.053 --> 01:59:04.094]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:59:04.514 --> 01:59:05.054]  We listened.
[01:59:05.514 --> 01:59:09.155]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:59:09.195 --> 01:59:10.135]  We're good to go.
[01:59:35.857 --> 01:59:38.298]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:59:38.318 --> 01:59:38.978]  Big Brother.
[01:59:38.998 --> 01:59:39.698]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:39.898 --> 01:59:40.538]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:40.558 --> 01:59:41.299]  You want answers?
[01:59:42.279 --> 01:59:46.120]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.236 --> 02:00:01.137]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:01.417 --> 02:00:05.519]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:07.799 --> 02:00:08.800]  That's right, my friends.
[02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:12.201]  We're now 30 seconds into this third hour.
[02:00:12.221 --> 02:00:18.443]  We're going to have wide open phones on any issue, topic you'd like to discuss.
[02:00:19.335 --> 02:00:19.836]  We're good to go.
[02:00:19.856 --> 02:00:19.996]  I think?
[02:00:39.432 --> 02:00:42.092]  World's wealthiest family, according to this report.
[02:00:42.133 --> 02:00:44.213]  That's not actually accurate, but we'll go over it.
[02:00:45.293 --> 02:00:49.234]  Let's go ahead now and get all these great callers out of the way that have been patiently holding.
[02:00:49.674 --> 02:00:51.474]  Roger in Pennsylvania, go ahead.
[02:00:51.874 --> 02:00:52.694]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[02:00:52.714 --> 02:01:02.836]  See, I had called the last 30 seconds of the show yesterday, and I was trying to respond about these bush-loving, ostensible Christians.
[02:01:03.216 --> 02:01:08.537]  And as I said about, you know, the only detractor I've heard on your show, Ben Bailey,
[02:01:11.872 --> 02:01:28.531]  But these questions, if you're all wet, Alex, and your interpretations of these things, then shouldn't these people be the same ones demanding truly exhaustive congressional investigations that can redeem the reputation of George Bush?
[02:01:29.312 --> 02:01:29.992]  Let's do this, Roger.
[02:01:30.012 --> 02:01:30.133]  Sure.
[02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:38.424]  If Bill Clinton was voting for total, blanket, absolute amnesty, and then said it wasn't amnesty, imagine the howl from conservatives.
[02:01:38.744 --> 02:01:43.587]  If Bill Clinton was going to reauthorize the assault weapons ban, imagine the upset.
[02:01:43.968 --> 02:01:56.576]  If Bill Clinton was signing campaign finance reform, if Bill Clinton was giving all the supercomputers to China, if Bill Clinton had lied about weapons of mass destruction, which he is, he's saying Bush is right, by the way, of course, they're together,
[02:01:57.456 --> 02:01:59.997]  Imagine if it was Bill Clinton or Al Gore doing this.
[02:02:00.137 --> 02:02:07.699]  Oh, no, but because it's Bush, oh, suddenly the Patriot Act's good, and all Christians should be for it.
[02:02:08.140 --> 02:02:10.220]  Well, the microchip isn't the mark of the beast.
[02:02:11.381 --> 02:02:13.862]  You know, the head of the 700 Club says.
[02:02:13.922 --> 02:02:14.702]  I have him on video.
[02:02:15.242 --> 02:02:19.243]  To which I would just add... And by the way, forced abortion in China isn't bad either.
[02:02:20.044 --> 02:02:24.005]  Yeah, to which I would just add, as impossible as it sounds, that with the...
[02:02:25.126 --> 02:02:29.168]  The secrecy of Bill Clinton, Bush has managed to exceed that.
[02:02:29.668 --> 02:02:40.074]  Now let's say, forsake the argument that, say, in foreign intelligence, you have to keep, say, secret, I don't know, 20-30% of it so you don't jeopardize investigations or sources.
[02:02:40.614 --> 02:02:51.640]  If that's the case, it would only stand to be maybe 2% for domestic purposes, having anything to do with true security of our country.
[02:02:52.432 --> 02:02:52.872]  I hear you.
[02:02:52.892 --> 02:02:54.053]  There's a cover-up.
[02:02:54.093 --> 02:02:54.734]  But, I mean, look.
[02:02:54.774 --> 02:03:00.119]  People say, well, Bush didn't lie about weapons of mass destruction.
[02:03:00.439 --> 02:03:03.702]  Were you watching the State of the Union last year?
[02:03:21.596 --> 02:03:22.577]  Or the year before that?
[02:03:22.877 --> 02:03:28.120]  Yeah, well, watching that State of the Union, that truly is service above and beyond the call of duty.
[02:03:28.900 --> 02:03:29.861]  Thanks for the call, Roger.
[02:03:31.062 --> 02:03:33.904]  Folks, the country's cooked.
[02:03:34.084 --> 02:03:40.347]  If we don't turn around now, blanket total amnesty, and then he says it's not amnesty.
[02:03:40.708 --> 02:03:42.369]  That right there shows you it's all lies.
[02:03:43.349 --> 02:03:44.870]  We need to redo the Patriot Act.
[02:03:44.890 --> 02:03:45.551]  We need more of it.
[02:03:45.571 --> 02:03:47.712]  Well, you already did sign Patriot Act 2, Bush.
[02:03:49.011 --> 02:03:50.372]  But again, Bush is a puppet.
[02:03:50.472 --> 02:03:51.912]  Bush isn't doing anything.
[02:03:51.992 --> 02:03:55.854]  But because he's a puppet, he makes conservatives think everything's okay.
[02:03:56.454 --> 02:04:06.339]  Well, if you want to call me a liberal because I'm against Pat Robertson saying China's doing what it has to do with forced abortion and infanticide, then okay, I'm a liberal because I'm against forced abortion and infanticide.
[02:04:07.479 --> 02:04:09.180]  I mean, I'm a liberal because I'm against gun control.
[02:04:10.376 --> 02:04:12.917]  That's literally, literally, literally.
[02:04:12.937 --> 02:04:17.119]  I hear callers to national shows calling and go, I'm a real conservative, Bush is a liberal.
[02:04:17.519 --> 02:04:20.221]  And the host will hang up and go, you're a seminar caller.
[02:04:20.481 --> 02:04:21.801]  You're really a big liberal.
[02:04:23.422 --> 02:04:24.803]  You know, Bush is conservative.
[02:04:24.923 --> 02:04:25.483]  Shut up!
[02:04:26.824 --> 02:04:28.925]  I mean, it's just totally dishonest.
[02:04:29.605 --> 02:04:31.886]  They control the Republicans and the Democrats.
[02:04:32.606 --> 02:04:34.167]  They're putting the agenda in place.
[02:04:34.627 --> 02:04:36.068]  We have to stop it.
[02:04:37.066 --> 02:04:41.989]  Eric and Joan, I mean Joyce and others, your calls are up next.
[02:04:42.009 --> 02:04:42.569]  Then more news.
[02:04:42.589 --> 02:04:42.989]  Stay with me.
[02:04:44.750 --> 02:04:47.511]  Americans, are you fed up with Big Brother watching you like a hawk?
[02:04:47.732 --> 02:04:54.035]  Have you ever asked yourself why you're being tracked, categorized, numbered, classified, registered, and licensed by the government?
[02:04:54.355 --> 02:05:00.218]  Would you like to make your assets vanish before the eyes of those who want to grab them, but still have them safe and sound?
[02:05:00.678 --> 02:05:04.400]  How about operating a business in a way that makes earnings tax-exempt?
[02:05:05.129 --> 02:05:06.691]  Maybe you'd like to be lawsuit-proof.
[02:05:06.951 --> 02:05:07.792]  Well, there is a way.
[02:05:08.052 --> 02:05:14.158]  And it protects your stuff from greedy lawyers, grasping relatives, and the government, especially the IRS.
[02:05:14.538 --> 02:05:24.808]  It's a unique instrument valid everywhere in the world where the right to contract is accepted, which has protected Americans for over 230 years and is specifically guaranteed by the U.S.
[02:05:24.868 --> 02:05:25.669]  Constitution.
[02:05:25.949 --> 02:05:27.570]  You don't have to go offshore to do it, either.
[02:05:27.851 --> 02:05:30.153]  This is safe, secure, and domestic.
[02:05:30.593 --> 02:05:38.305]  To get full details, and I do mean full details, get on the Internet and go to either puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[02:05:38.586 --> 02:05:43.012]  That's puretrust, one word, puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[02:05:44.833 --> 02:05:53.439]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling clean water possible.
[02:05:53.660 --> 02:06:04.948]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:06:05.168 --> 02:06:07.790]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:06:08.150 --> 02:06:09.051]  We're good to go.
[02:06:09.071 --> 02:06:09.792]  We're good to go.
[02:06:29.093 --> 02:06:33.035]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:06:33.775 --> 02:06:34.475]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:06:44.716 --> 02:06:51.541]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:06:51.861 --> 02:06:53.242]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:06:53.442 --> 02:06:55.643]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:06:55.803 --> 02:06:57.885]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:06:58.165 --> 02:07:03.108]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:07:03.448 --> 02:07:07.451]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:07:07.711 --> 02:07:09.492]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:07:09.572 --> 02:07:20.216]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and planable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:07:20.356 --> 02:07:22.276]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:07:22.476 --> 02:07:26.338]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[02:07:26.418 --> 02:07:27.838]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[02:07:34.741 --> 02:07:35.301]  Big Brother.
[02:07:35.321 --> 02:07:36.102]  Mainstream media.
[02:07:36.122 --> 02:07:37.022]  Government cover-ups.
[02:07:37.162 --> 02:07:37.962]  You want answers?
[02:07:38.002 --> 02:07:38.843]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:57.390 --> 02:08:01.333]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:01.573 --> 02:08:05.676]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:06.537 --> 02:08:12.642]  Okay, I'm going to take three more calls real fast, then I'm going to go back into news, then back into calls.
[02:08:13.823 --> 02:08:16.505]  Let's talk to Eric up in Skull and Bones country.
[02:08:16.525 --> 02:08:19.687]  I guess I should say Christian conservative country.
[02:08:19.707 --> 02:08:23.410]  And we're liberal country here because we're against abortion.
[02:08:24.170 --> 02:08:25.952]  Eric up in Connecticut, go ahead.
[02:08:26.618 --> 02:08:27.958]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[02:08:28.319 --> 02:08:29.699]  Welcome from Neocon Advocate.
[02:08:30.219 --> 02:08:30.799]  That's right.
[02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:46.284]  You know, and speaking of Neocons, I got my first Freedom Magazine from the Neocon Rifle Association, and I looked and looked and looked through that magazine, Alex, and I couldn't find one reference to George W. Bush wanting to reauthorize the assault weapons ban.
[02:08:47.519 --> 02:08:52.384]  Or any of the other... Did you hear about him doubling the funding for the BATF?
[02:08:53.025 --> 02:08:53.706]  Is that in there?
[02:08:53.846 --> 02:08:58.470]  Yes, I did, but they somehow managed to omit that, and they didn't say anything about that.
[02:08:58.871 --> 02:09:00.693]  Oh, but they told you how good he is, right?
[02:09:01.113 --> 02:09:01.694]  Yes, they did.
[02:09:01.714 --> 02:09:10.022]  They also said he's fighting for freedom, and also they poo-pooed the idea that Bush and Bin Laden could be long-time business pals.
[02:09:10.680 --> 02:09:18.445]  Oh, when it's publicly admitted by the FBI in hundreds of publications and the White House doesn't even deny it, but that's not true either.
[02:09:18.685 --> 02:09:23.688]  That's right, and I think you're right, Alex, that if the NRA truly wanted us to get our gun rights back...
[02:09:24.386 --> 02:09:25.247]  We'd get them back.
[02:09:25.467 --> 02:09:33.654]  Yeah, with 5.5 million members out of the 160 million gun owners, they're there to pacify those that are politically active.
[02:09:33.674 --> 02:09:43.281]  And again, NRA, two months ago, federal court, of course they lost the case, their pro-gun stance was we are for all guns being registered and not being able to leave the home with them.
[02:09:43.782 --> 02:09:46.524]  Yep, gun control is good for their bottom line.
[02:09:46.986 --> 02:09:47.666]  It really is.
[02:09:47.906 --> 02:09:52.788]  Well, look, we've had one of the former board members on, and they'll tell you they're selling you out.
[02:09:53.068 --> 02:09:59.890]  Oh, yeah, and as soon as they submarine Neil Knox back in 1994, you saw the Bradyville come in and the assault weapons ban and a lot of other things.
[02:10:00.070 --> 02:10:01.151]  Yeah, look, it's simple.
[02:10:01.191 --> 02:10:08.313]  When an enemy force, a mechanized, military, scientifically run enemy force of organized criminals...
[02:10:08.673 --> 02:10:09.414]  One more thing, Alex.
[02:10:09.474 --> 02:10:17.780]  I have a great report in addition to the superb information you've put out about World Trade Center 7 on your website and Paul Joseph Watson's website.
[02:10:34.582 --> 02:10:44.689]  It's a 28-page report, and it's called The Female Report on World Trade Center, Seven Collapses, a Total Joke, and it's at www.indiehawaii.org.
[02:10:44.869 --> 02:10:45.549]  Do me a favor.
[02:10:46.069 --> 02:10:55.295]  Email that to tipsandinfowars.com, and email that to Paul Watson, the contact info on Prison Planet, and he will get that posted.
[02:10:55.315 --> 02:10:56.396]  I know he's doing an update.
[02:10:56.916 --> 02:10:57.197]  Okay.
[02:10:57.657 --> 02:10:58.317]  You got it, Alex.
[02:10:58.457 --> 02:10:59.478]  Thank you for the call, sir.
[02:10:59.558 --> 02:11:02.300]  I really appreciate that call from Connecticut.
[02:11:03.270 --> 02:11:06.792]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joyce in Wisconsin.
[02:11:06.812 --> 02:11:07.532]  Go ahead, Joyce.
[02:11:07.672 --> 02:11:12.974]  Yes, I'd like to address the caller a while back that called about the book of Revelation.
[02:11:13.795 --> 02:11:17.196]  And the book of Revelation is not written in stone.
[02:11:18.097 --> 02:11:24.760]  And he was saying that what's the use of doing anything to try to stop this new world order?
[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:32.343]  And that's just the mindset that the church of Laodicea that was addressed at the beginning of the book of Revelation had.
[02:11:32.901 --> 02:11:35.885]  And it's just like the cookie-cutter church today.
[02:11:36.746 --> 02:11:41.792]  And if we don't do anything about it, the book of Revelation tells us what's going to happen to us.
[02:11:41.992 --> 02:11:43.914]  I just wanted to straighten them out a little bit.
[02:11:44.075 --> 02:11:45.096]  Well, let me just say this.
[02:11:45.116 --> 02:11:45.957]  I mean, I'm a Christian.
[02:11:45.977 --> 02:11:49.821]  I believe the Bible, it's incredible revealed knowledge.
[02:11:50.926 --> 02:11:53.467]  I mean, I've had God work in my life.
[02:11:53.507 --> 02:11:54.468]  I've had experiences, folks.
[02:11:54.568 --> 02:11:55.228]  I know it's real.
[02:11:55.728 --> 02:11:59.430]  But the cop-out, people in Nazi Germany thought it was the end of the world.
[02:11:59.450 --> 02:12:01.471]  They think it in Africa whenever there's a slaughter.
[02:12:01.951 --> 02:12:02.972]  They think it in China.
[02:12:03.992 --> 02:12:09.495]  And I hear these so-called Christians giggling, going, praise God that there's a microchip they're going to put on us.
[02:12:09.535 --> 02:12:10.896]  That means it's the end.
[02:12:11.836 --> 02:12:15.598]  Well, you know, and people think they're going to be
[02:12:16.465 --> 02:12:17.366]  We're good to go.
[02:12:17.386 --> 02:12:17.846]  We're good to go.
[02:12:33.033 --> 02:12:33.353]  Okay?
[02:12:33.613 --> 02:12:37.895]  And again, even an atheist should be against the matrix and caps and tips.
[02:12:38.516 --> 02:12:48.120]  The New York Times said that to graduate from high school, you'll have to watch hours of surveillance cameras hooked into your computer from different parts of the country and report suspicious activity.
[02:12:48.140 --> 02:12:51.421]  The Fed's making us sit at tattletale computer terminals.
[02:12:51.781 --> 02:12:54.763]  I mean, it's just so far gone already.
[02:12:55.143 --> 02:12:57.504]  They're putting in the cashless society control grid.
[02:12:57.524 --> 02:12:57.724]  Look.
[02:13:00.538 --> 02:13:03.165]  Just ten years ago, most Americans were for abortion.
[02:13:03.325 --> 02:13:04.668]  Now, because we've told the truth...
[02:13:05.259 --> 02:13:06.319]  A lot of heroes have.
[02:13:06.559 --> 02:13:07.820]  The majority are against it.
[02:13:08.260 --> 02:13:11.241]  We have the power, and we can get a reprieve.
[02:13:11.721 --> 02:13:18.522]  If anything's clear, we can back off the judgment 50 years, 100 years, if we repent.
[02:13:18.822 --> 02:13:20.083]  And that's God's promise.
[02:13:20.183 --> 02:13:21.223]  And it's common sense.
[02:13:21.623 --> 02:13:24.924]  If good people get involved and fight evil, it's not going to run rampant.
[02:13:24.944 --> 02:13:29.625]  But if we say there's nothing we can do, look at it, it's too powerful, and then don't do anything, it's over.
[02:13:29.645 --> 02:13:30.545]  I was at the pet store last night,
[02:13:34.011 --> 02:13:34.871]  Buying dog food.
[02:13:34.891 --> 02:13:36.712]  And he walks over and he goes, Mr. Jones?
[02:13:36.772 --> 02:13:37.052]  And I go, yeah.
[02:13:37.112 --> 02:13:39.653]  And he goes, aren't you afraid they're going to kill you?
[02:13:40.513 --> 02:13:41.213]  And I said, no.
[02:13:41.373 --> 02:13:44.414]  And he goes, weren't you worried about the IRS, you know, coming after you?
[02:13:44.894 --> 02:13:45.454]  I said, no.
[02:13:46.114 --> 02:13:49.975]  Well, you know, I mean, I know what you're saying is true.
[02:13:49.995 --> 02:13:51.736]  You know, I'm this computer software engineer.
[02:13:51.776 --> 02:13:52.476]  I've checked it out.
[02:13:52.536 --> 02:13:54.056]  But I'm not about to go public.
[02:13:54.096 --> 02:13:55.117]  Something might happen to me.
[02:13:55.557 --> 02:13:56.537]  And I said, look, buddy.
[02:13:57.797 --> 02:13:58.658]  I said, listen to me.
[02:13:59.718 --> 02:14:00.218]  I said, it...
[02:14:01.478 --> 02:14:04.822]  When everybody's got the attitude you've got, you ensure tyranny.
[02:14:04.842 --> 02:14:06.524]  You ensure a bad life for yourself.
[02:14:06.785 --> 02:14:14.133]  It always takes a few people like me that are willing to put it all on the line so people like you can sit there on their hind ends.
[02:14:14.934 --> 02:14:17.898]  And the guy got freaked out and ran off.
[02:14:17.978 --> 02:14:18.699]  I'm sick of it!
[02:14:19.139 --> 02:14:20.940]  I mean, it's not a choice for me.
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:22.301]  I don't have a choice.
[02:14:22.561 --> 02:14:28.764]  My very programming, my very soul, my very makeup... This is what disgusts me.
[02:14:29.184 --> 02:14:30.165]  I'm just a man.
[02:14:30.465 --> 02:14:31.645]  I'm just a man.
[02:14:31.965 --> 02:14:36.928]  I'm just doing what a man does, what a human being does when they see tyranny.
[02:14:37.168 --> 02:14:42.591]  The globalists, admittedly, have kidnapped millions of women and children publicly.
[02:14:42.931 --> 02:14:43.811]  This is all admitted.
[02:14:43.831 --> 02:14:45.292]  A huge section on Prison Planet...
[02:14:45.652 --> 02:14:45.972]  Exactly.
[02:14:46.052 --> 02:14:47.393]  It is not debatable!
[02:15:08.566 --> 02:15:10.627]  It just makes me so mad.
[02:15:10.847 --> 02:15:21.992]  If that guy wasn't a coward, if all these people that talked to me weren't cowards and would get involved and realize the leadership they've got and be the leaders they are, this New World Order would be trashed in ten minutes.
[02:15:22.052 --> 02:15:22.532]  That's right.
[02:15:23.953 --> 02:15:25.014]  Can I ask you something?
[02:15:25.194 --> 02:15:26.054]  Sure.
[02:15:27.835 --> 02:15:28.775]  There was a news blurb.
[02:15:28.795 --> 02:15:35.238]  It was a national news blurb on last night's news about the Patriot Act being unconstitutional.
[02:15:35.578 --> 02:15:36.959]  Doesn't that protect the terrorists?
[02:15:39.651 --> 02:15:41.332]  Of course, you're being sarcastic, right?
[02:15:41.732 --> 02:15:41.932]  No.
[02:15:41.952 --> 02:15:50.237]  No, it sounds like it's protecting the terrorists, that the terrorists have constitutional rights, that groups of people shouldn't be protected, that they deem terrorists, you know.
[02:15:52.358 --> 02:15:52.738]  I hear you.
[02:15:52.798 --> 02:15:54.019]  I appreciate the call.
[02:15:54.059 --> 02:15:58.982]  Look, what's happening with the courts is the terrorist is the military-industrial complex.
[02:15:59.422 --> 02:16:00.983]  They get the power, the control out of it.
[02:16:01.023 --> 02:16:01.763]  They have the motive.
[02:16:02.003 --> 02:16:03.504]  Then you look at the evidence of who's done it.
[02:16:03.604 --> 02:16:04.105]  It's them.
[02:16:05.745 --> 02:16:05.946]  But...
[02:16:08.516 --> 02:16:19.142]  This is a judge going after a very small provision in it, and they've had high federal courts say stuff's unconstitutional, and Bush just says, I don't care.
[02:16:20.823 --> 02:16:23.925]  And the Supreme Court has been ruling on campaign finance reform.
[02:16:24.765 --> 02:16:27.286]  It's been ruling on all this stuff saying it's good.
[02:16:28.847 --> 02:16:30.488]  Again, your so-called conservative court.
[02:16:31.909 --> 02:16:34.150]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:16:34.670 --> 02:16:35.351]  Let's talk to...
[02:16:37.503 --> 02:16:38.804]  Jay in Colorado.
[02:16:38.824 --> 02:16:39.485]  Go ahead, Jay.
[02:16:39.545 --> 02:16:40.326]  Hey, Alex.
[02:16:40.866 --> 02:16:44.870]  I wanted to ask you about the November elections.
[02:16:46.131 --> 02:16:47.932]  Really, like, who are you going to vote for?
[02:16:48.233 --> 02:16:48.933]  Let's be honest.
[02:16:48.993 --> 02:16:50.214]  There is no presidential election.
[02:16:53.783 --> 02:16:56.926]  And I can prove that from multiple directions.
[02:16:57.486 --> 02:17:00.468]  Everybody you're given a choice of is controlled.
[02:17:00.548 --> 02:17:01.689]  It's the oldest scam in the book.
[02:17:02.270 --> 02:17:08.034]  I control the choices in a certain paradigm that I give you a choice from within that controlled outcome.
[02:17:08.054 --> 02:17:08.515]  You understand?
[02:17:08.715 --> 02:17:08.895]  Sure.
[02:17:09.355 --> 02:17:19.441]  So it doesn't matter if it's Howard Dean or John Kerry, he's skull and bones, or George W. Bush, or Bill Clinton, or Al Gore, or the Easter Bunny, it's all the same agenda.
[02:17:19.601 --> 02:17:24.864]  Open borders, gun control, bigger government, Patriot Act, Homeland Security, loss of freedom.
[02:17:25.505 --> 02:17:31.628]  And as soon as we realize it's a fraud, and realize it's controlled, then we can set about fixing it.
[02:17:31.988 --> 02:17:36.551]  But as long as we stay in la-la land about how far down the rat hole we've gone, we're going nowhere.
[02:17:36.571 --> 02:17:37.612]  I'll tell you where the fight is.
[02:17:39.324 --> 02:17:41.546]  It's in the counties and the cities and the states.
[02:17:42.026 --> 02:17:49.131]  And number one, you've got to stop the touchscreen electronic voting systems from going in that the feds are paying, forcing to be put in.
[02:17:50.332 --> 02:17:52.374]  Nine states have said they're not putting it in for now.
[02:17:52.614 --> 02:17:54.215]  The feds are trying to twist their arms.
[02:17:54.516 --> 02:17:55.676]  They've caught them in fraud.
[02:17:55.696 --> 02:17:56.657]  You've got to stop that.
[02:17:58.198 --> 02:18:00.240]  You've got to get control of your counties, your cities.
[02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:01.581]  You've got to educate the people.
[02:18:03.022 --> 02:18:06.404]  I mean, look, the hour is late, my friend.
[02:18:06.444 --> 02:18:06.785]  Go ahead.
[02:18:07.313 --> 02:18:09.836]  I just mean, like, I know I'm aware of all that.
[02:18:09.896 --> 02:18:13.341]  BlackBoxVoting.com is really good on that and all that.
[02:18:13.381 --> 02:18:15.844]  But I'm saying November 2nd comes around, when it comes around.
[02:18:16.685 --> 02:18:18.347]  Do you do a write-in vote?
[02:18:20.269 --> 02:18:21.110]  Don't vote at all?
[02:18:21.130 --> 02:18:22.472]  I mean, what are you going to do?
[02:18:22.532 --> 02:18:23.293]  Like, what should you do?
[02:18:23.353 --> 02:18:25.916]  Well, number one, I refuse to walk into...
[02:18:26.952 --> 02:18:27.532]  We're good to go.
[02:18:56.483 --> 02:18:57.104]  Like boycott.
[02:18:57.384 --> 02:18:58.445]  We've already fallen here.
[02:18:58.565 --> 02:18:59.806]  Sir, we're falling right now.
[02:19:00.066 --> 02:19:01.487]  It's all coming down right now.
[02:19:01.828 --> 02:19:02.208]  Oh, I know.
[02:19:02.228 --> 02:19:04.170]  That's what I mean.
[02:19:04.510 --> 02:19:09.814]  We are two years away, if not sooner, from 1984 on steroids.
[02:19:10.835 --> 02:19:12.236]  Why do you think the government's so arrogant?
[02:19:12.376 --> 02:19:13.938]  And they don't care if you catch them in lies.
[02:19:14.658 --> 02:19:15.979]  Because everybody's busy, they know it.
[02:19:16.420 --> 02:19:17.080]  And no one cares.
[02:19:17.261 --> 02:19:23.566]  Like, not no one cares, but I mean... A lot of people care, but they say nobody cares and I can't do anything.
[02:19:24.528 --> 02:19:24.948]  Right.
[02:19:25.009 --> 02:19:30.193]  I mean, even when you vote, you can't really vote because it's all... I'll tell you what you do in these nine states that are not doing it.
[02:19:30.213 --> 02:19:32.195]  People are suing them, saying, you've taken my right.
[02:19:32.435 --> 02:19:33.316]  There's no paper ballot.
[02:19:33.716 --> 02:19:36.018]  There's a bill in Congress to make them go back to paper ballots.
[02:19:36.679 --> 02:19:37.439]  You've got power.
[02:19:37.499 --> 02:19:42.544]  You need to sue to stop the system going in or sue if it's in.
[02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:46.581]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[02:19:46.661 --> 02:19:47.321]  Hello, folks.
[02:19:47.461 --> 02:19:57.385]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:19:57.745 --> 02:20:02.267]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:20:02.347 --> 02:20:13.691]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:20:14.271 --> 02:20:21.118]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:20:21.519 --> 02:20:23.661]  Your purified water is now ready.
[02:20:24.142 --> 02:20:29.127]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.
[02:20:29.427 --> 02:20:35.573]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[02:20:36.254 --> 02:20:36.494]  803-4438.
[02:20:36.554 --> 02:20:39.979]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:20:40.219 --> 02:20:40.960]  That's toll free.
[02:20:40.980 --> 02:20:41.020]  888-803-4438.
[02:20:44.995 --> 02:20:46.156]  Let's face facts, shall we?
[02:20:46.356 --> 02:20:49.259]  The only place that bald is beautiful is on cue balls and eagles.
[02:20:49.599 --> 02:20:52.261]  Yet millions continue to suffer through hair loss needlessly.
[02:20:52.281 --> 02:20:53.362]  Now some good news.
[02:20:53.702 --> 02:20:57.506]  Nissim International has developed the New Hair Biofactor Stimulating System.
[02:20:57.786 --> 02:21:04.271]  A product line of ultra deep cleansing shampoos and hair stimulating extracts designed to maximize the natural growth cycle of your hair.
[02:21:04.531 --> 02:21:06.473]  Nissim New Hair Biofactor Shampoos.
[02:21:06.653 --> 02:21:07.133]  We're good to go.
[02:21:31.032 --> 02:21:31.653]  1-800-65-N-I-S-I-M That's 1-800-656-4746
[02:21:45.146 --> 02:21:49.050]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:21:49.270 --> 02:22:01.541]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:22:01.981 --> 02:22:02.381]  The U.S.
[02:22:02.421 --> 02:22:08.006]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:22:08.407 --> 02:22:10.609]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:22:12.470 --> 02:22:12.950]  We're good to go.
[02:22:33.297 --> 02:22:33.498]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[02:22:44.597 --> 02:22:45.998]  Did you know you've been cheated?
[02:22:46.098 --> 02:22:48.801]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[02:22:49.021 --> 02:22:49.802]  You heard that right.
[02:22:49.902 --> 02:22:52.504]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[02:22:52.664 --> 02:22:53.705]  You don't have to pay them off.
[02:22:53.966 --> 02:22:55.387]  The banks are defrauding you.
[02:22:55.647 --> 02:22:57.108]  Now is the time to fight back.
[02:22:57.289 --> 02:22:59.851]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.
[02:23:00.011 --> 02:23:03.414]  The procedure's easy, and everything is done legally and within the law.
[02:23:03.614 --> 02:23:05.376]  Almost no one has ever failed.

[02:23:08.819 --> 02:23:11.041]  The process is simple and is nonjudicial.
[02:23:11.221 --> 02:23:11.541]  We're good to go.
[02:23:27.777 --> 02:23:28.658]  Stop the rip-off.
[02:23:29.018 --> 02:23:31.540]  Learn the truth.

[02:23:48.994 --> 02:23:51.116]  Alright, let me cover news for a while.
[02:23:51.136 --> 02:23:53.098]  And then we'll get to...
[02:23:54.950 --> 02:24:00.154]  All the great folks that are patiently holding to briefly try to answer Jay's important question.
[02:24:00.814 --> 02:24:03.416]  Who would I vote for if I still had a right to vote?
[02:24:03.856 --> 02:24:05.237]  I mean, this has been the history of America.
[02:24:05.257 --> 02:24:06.819]  You know, blacks and Indians couldn't vote.
[02:24:07.239 --> 02:24:10.801]  Well, now it's back to that all of us can't vote once they put in the electronic systems.
[02:24:11.022 --> 02:24:13.984]  They've caught them engaged in fraud in every state where they put it in.
[02:24:14.684 --> 02:24:18.006]  Convicted felons running the elections for computer crimes.
[02:24:18.787 --> 02:24:19.728]  I mean, it's over, folks.
[02:24:19.768 --> 02:24:22.189]  The CIA publicly runs the big three voting companies.
[02:24:22.850 --> 02:24:24.231]  I've done dozens of shows on this.
[02:24:25.608 --> 02:24:29.351]  But if I had a right to vote, I would vote the Constitution Party.
[02:24:29.371 --> 02:24:32.454]  I would vote for the Libertarian Party candidates of my choice.
[02:24:33.034 --> 02:24:34.095]  But there is no election.
[02:24:35.556 --> 02:24:38.118]  After all, sir, as Patrick Henry said, we have no election.
[02:24:38.878 --> 02:24:43.682]  And the feds are planned by next year to have this in in all 50 states in every county and city.
[02:24:44.102 --> 02:24:49.606]  Nine states because, quote, of questions about problems of the machines have stopped it for now.
[02:24:49.626 --> 02:24:52.809]  But under federal law in two years, they have to put it in.
[02:24:53.669 --> 02:24:56.330]  And that's the voter assistance act.
[02:24:56.470 --> 02:24:57.690]  They're helping you.
[02:24:57.750 --> 02:24:59.191]  The feds are helping.
[02:24:59.211 --> 02:25:03.692]  And, folks, you know I don't get up here on the air and make claims that aren't documented.
[02:25:04.192 --> 02:25:06.993]  You don't have a right to vote if you've got electronic voting machines.
[02:25:07.733 --> 02:25:10.974]  And the League of Women Voters are arguing in Congress to block...
[02:25:12.398 --> 02:25:15.122]  A congressman's bill to demand a paper ballot.
[02:25:15.162 --> 02:25:27.297]  Okay, use your computer, but a ballot and how you voted gets printed off according to number, not your name, but according to number, and put in a box for recounts, which then they have to go in and hand-steal and scam and...
[02:25:28.012 --> 02:25:28.072]  No!
[02:25:28.112 --> 02:25:29.392]  Don't be a conspiracy theorist!
[02:25:55.911 --> 02:25:59.313]  No, we just have the top engineer at Diebold quitting, saying it's all a fraud.
[02:26:00.133 --> 02:26:10.998]  We have major reporters getting into a meeting where the heads of four of the voting companies and others were meeting with the government, talking about, don't let the public know this is racketeering.
[02:26:11.638 --> 02:26:16.080]  We will deliver all the votes to George W. He will deliver all of them.
[02:26:16.120 --> 02:26:18.741]  And a lot of conservatives go, well, I kind of like that then.
[02:26:19.261 --> 02:26:21.022]  We don't need to vote no more.
[02:26:21.062 --> 02:26:22.823]  We'll just have George Bush forever.
[02:26:24.781 --> 02:26:25.722]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[02:26:25.822 --> 02:26:29.285]  And don't worry, the Democrats, this federal system, they'll control it when they're in office.
[02:26:32.568 --> 02:26:38.514]  Al Gore was trying to steal the election, but he didn't have as much control of the states as Lord Bush did.
[02:26:39.915 --> 02:26:43.739]  And Bush definitely did steal the election, so you had two different crime rings fighting with each other.
[02:26:44.492 --> 02:26:45.493]  And what happened?
[02:26:45.513 --> 02:26:47.595]  The Supreme Court appointed our first president.
[02:26:47.655 --> 02:26:48.475]  Never happened before.
[02:26:48.515 --> 02:26:51.177]  We now have our first appointed hereditary leader.
[02:26:51.198 --> 02:26:55.361]  Kind of like Syria has Assad or North Korea has Kim Jong-il.
[02:26:56.942 --> 02:26:57.843]  Not a good sign.
[02:26:58.964 --> 02:27:00.205]  Oh man, there's so much here.
[02:27:00.945 --> 02:27:03.928]  Let me cover this first.
[02:27:04.168 --> 02:27:09.772]  Dean called for microchip ID card to use the internet after Howard Dean's unexpected defeat last week in Iowa.
[02:27:10.033 --> 02:27:11.674]  Public attention is focused on his temper.
[02:27:12.737 --> 02:27:20.182]  His character and his guttural Tyrannosaurus bellow of the not-so-quite-a-concussion speech.
[02:27:20.402 --> 02:27:26.186]  But Dean's views on America's private rights may be of a superior test of his fitness to be president.
[02:27:26.766 --> 02:27:28.447]  Well, if that's the case, then you shouldn't like Bush.
[02:27:28.487 --> 02:27:29.127]  He's called for it.
[02:27:29.568 --> 02:27:37.633]  Dean's current stand on privacy appears to leave little wiggle room as campaign platform pledges unwavering support for the constitutional principles of equality, liberty, and privacy.
[02:27:38.890 --> 02:27:50.134]  But Dean went on to say, though, we must move to smaller, smarter license cards that carry some digital information that can be universally read at vital checkpoints.
[02:27:50.535 --> 02:27:57.277]  Dean said in March 2002, according to a copy of his repair remarks, issuing such a card would have little effect on the privacy of Americans.
[02:27:57.777 --> 02:28:03.480]  He went on with quotes saying you should have to swipe a card to use a computer, buy, sell.
[02:28:03.640 --> 02:28:05.240]  Well, that's just a standard platform.
[02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:07.121]  I mean, you know, that's what they're putting in.
[02:28:08.354 --> 02:28:12.877]  And, of course, you'll get the same thing with John F. Carey or you or W or any of them.
[02:28:14.318 --> 02:28:17.260]  Three doctors dispute how Dr. David Kelly died.
[02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:30.829]  This is a medical professionals and trauma orthopedic surgeon and specialist on anesthesiologists and diagnostic radiologists who do not think evidence given at the Hutton inquiry has demonstrated that Dr. David Kelly committed suicide.
[02:28:31.769 --> 02:28:34.091]  And here's another article out of the...
[02:28:35.376 --> 02:28:37.898]  Oh, this is out of the evening standard.
[02:28:38.399 --> 02:28:40.941]  Dr. David Kelly did not kill himself.
[02:28:40.981 --> 02:28:44.844]  An American confederate, Dr. David Kelly, has cast doubt on whether his death was suicide.
[02:28:45.345 --> 02:28:54.353]  Days before Lord Hutton's report into his death is published, Maya Pedersen claimed the government scientists received death threats because of his work in Iraq.
[02:28:54.373 --> 02:28:55.494]  We reported this three months ago.
[02:28:56.114 --> 02:29:06.783]  She said she was surprised that he had apparently taken 20 painkillers, which were undigested, before slashing his wrists in remote woodland because he has an aversion to swallowing tablets.
[02:29:07.624 --> 02:29:07.804]  Ms.
[02:29:07.844 --> 02:29:14.209]  Peterson, a United States Air Force translator who worked alongside Dr. David Kelly in Iraq, refused to give evidence to Lord Hutton's inquiry.
[02:29:14.949 --> 02:29:22.816]  But in a statement to police, she said Dr. David Kelly had told her he would never commit suicide and that he feared that he would be found dead in the woods.
[02:29:24.837 --> 02:29:25.378]  Reported that
[02:29:26.332 --> 02:29:26.893]  Four months ago.
[02:29:27.893 --> 02:29:30.115]  And there's these other scientists saying he was clearly murdered.
[02:29:30.835 --> 02:29:32.116]  Just like Diana!
[02:29:35.218 --> 02:29:36.138]  We're on the march.
[02:29:36.619 --> 02:29:38.220]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:39.140 --> 02:29:41.822]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:30:02.535 --> 02:30:03.076]  We're good to go.
[02:30:31.391 --> 02:30:34.474]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:30:34.654 --> 02:30:40.519]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:30:44.275 --> 02:30:48.078]  Hi, this is Jack Browning with a special offer to listeners of GCN Radio.
[02:30:48.399 --> 02:30:55.344]  Use a Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and a Bill of Rights for your good, not the good of manipulating government agencies.

[02:30:57.326 --> 02:31:01.810]  GCN is contracted with Midas Resources for copies of The Citizen's Rulebook.
[02:31:01.970 --> 02:31:03.231]  This is more than a handbook.
[02:31:03.251 --> 02:31:06.734]  It is your guide to a freer life with less governmental interference.
[02:31:07.114 --> 02:31:07.835]  Here's the deal.
[02:31:08.055 --> 02:31:19.320]  Call MRI at 800-686-2237 and obtain two handbooks, one for yourself, one for a friend, and two silver dollars for just $24.95, shipping included.
[02:31:19.560 --> 02:31:25.844]  More than half these coins were melted under the Pittman Act of 1918 and later with a great silver run of the 70s and 80s.
[02:31:26.924 --> 02:31:31.745]  There are less than one of these coins surviving for every 20 persons in the United States.
[02:31:32.086 --> 02:31:34.046]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[02:31:36.327 --> 02:31:38.167]  Ask for the Freedom Handbook Special.
[02:31:38.547 --> 02:31:39.868]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[02:31:39.888 --> 02:31:40.088]  Thank you.
[02:31:51.753 --> 02:31:56.708]  Now everyone knows that in order to have a healthy body you have to provide a diet of healthy food.
[02:31:57.189 --> 02:31:58.593]  Well the same is true for your mind.

[02:32:18.072 --> 02:32:20.212]  Now if that's not enough, there is a lot more.
[02:32:20.733 --> 02:32:24.034]  Whatever your taste, there is something for everyone at Genesis.

[02:33:01.352 --> 02:33:14.024]  Look, I don't want to sit here and talk 100 miles an hour, but the admitted, confirmed lying and criminal activity of the leaders of almost every government in the world
[02:33:15.094 --> 02:33:37.747]  The concerted effort to build a cashless society control grid to tax us and regulate us and discriminate against us, and having what level of security clearance we've got on our driver's license, part of the national ID card, and everything we buy and sell tracked, and cameras in the school bathrooms and showers, and cameras in the rest stops, and this isn't freedom!
[02:33:39.148 --> 02:33:40.349]  This is not America!
[02:33:43.809 --> 02:33:47.811]  The country is run by criminally insane nutcases.
[02:33:48.992 --> 02:33:52.354]  And by that, they're very intelligent, but they're on power trips.
[02:33:54.275 --> 02:33:57.057]  And they've got horrible eugenics plans for you and your family.
[02:33:58.277 --> 02:34:02.560]  One child policy worldwide, right here in the Western world, it's dying.
[02:34:02.580 --> 02:34:03.540]  Our population's dying.
[02:34:04.261 --> 02:34:06.162]  The old populations of Western Europe and the U.S.,
[02:34:07.490 --> 02:34:14.655]  Total regulation, total control, social services in all your lives, CPS in all your lives, banning homeschooling.
[02:34:14.896 --> 02:34:16.077]  This is all being announced.
[02:34:16.097 --> 02:34:17.237]  This is all being done.
[02:34:17.257 --> 02:34:23.382]  And when you really talk to people about these facts, they're not for it, but they're not taking action.
[02:34:23.622 --> 02:34:25.143]  And it's time you all do that.
[02:34:25.163 --> 02:34:29.046]  All right, let me just run through news, and we'll go to...
[02:34:30.467 --> 02:34:31.709]  All these callers that are holding.
[02:34:32.269 --> 02:34:36.394]  Again, part of the Patriot Act found to be unconstitutional, but we'll see what Bush does with that.
[02:34:36.434 --> 02:34:40.139]  Republican lawmakers won't back Bush on immigration because of the heat they're getting.
[02:34:41.075 --> 02:34:41.936]  That's some good news.
[02:34:42.316 --> 02:34:43.557]  Illegal immigration to the U.S.
[02:34:43.577 --> 02:34:46.820]  grew by nearly 70% in the last 12 years.
[02:34:46.880 --> 02:34:53.165]  The number of Mexicans illegally entering the United States increased by 66% from 1999 to 2002.
[02:34:53.305 --> 02:35:03.053]  The Mexican government report said Monday the study by the National Population Council found the number of Mexicans who cross the border illegally every year has grown to more than 1 million.
[02:35:03.453 --> 02:35:07.336]  Of that number, only about a third achieved their goal of staying in the United States to work.
[02:35:09.038 --> 02:35:10.639]  That's totally false numbers, folks.
[02:35:11.932 --> 02:35:16.033]  In Cochise County alone each year, in Arizona, there's one million.
[02:35:19.213 --> 02:35:20.234]  Thought you'd want to know about that.
[02:35:20.754 --> 02:35:24.294]  Criminal aliens abound in the U.S., the Washington Times.
[02:35:25.315 --> 02:35:36.617]  About 80,000 illegal criminal aliens, including convicted murderers, rapists, drug dealers, and child molesters, who served prison time and were released and loosed on the streets of America...
[02:35:37.603 --> 02:35:39.284]  Hiding from federal immigration authorities.
[02:35:39.424 --> 02:35:39.845]  Hiding.
[02:35:39.865 --> 02:35:44.888]  There hasn't been one raid in three months since Walmart got raided of any business.
[02:35:45.449 --> 02:36:01.020]  Despite the creation of a new agency to hunt down criminal aliens, that's a fraud, and the infusion of millions of dollars to get the job done, that's a fraud, many state and local police agencies who might contact with the aliens either never learned of their immigration status or never advised the federal government of their release.
[02:36:02.358 --> 02:36:09.422]  Two months ago, Vicente Fox came to Austin and gave an award to the police chief for, quote, not following the federal law.
[02:36:10.802 --> 02:36:11.723]  A foreign power.
[02:36:12.583 --> 02:36:14.384]  And it doesn't matter, Washington's doing it too.
[02:36:14.404 --> 02:36:18.967]  According to figures from 2002 from the Former Immigration and Nationalization Service and the U.S.
[02:36:19.007 --> 02:36:27.211]  Immigration and Customs Enforcement, more than 375,000 known illegal aliens have been ordered deported but have disappeared pending immigration hearings.
[02:36:27.591 --> 02:36:31.313]  Washington area sniper Lee Boyd Malvo was one such alien.
[02:36:33.526 --> 02:36:35.468]  He got arrested all the time.
[02:36:35.488 --> 02:36:36.289]  Always got released.
[02:36:59.375 --> 02:37:05.057]  Chiefs of Police, Border Security, a sham organization claims lacks federal policies causing murder of cops.
[02:37:05.677 --> 02:37:13.439]  The National Association of Chiefs of Police claims National Border Security is a sham, and the lack of controls by the federal government is rewarding criminals.
[02:37:13.599 --> 02:37:13.979]  Oh, really?
[02:37:14.459 --> 02:37:24.302]  In a statement, Jim Corey, vice president of the 14,000-member organization, slams the feds for using smoke and mirrors in our border security strategy.
[02:37:24.822 --> 02:37:27.283]  He also indicates states issuing driver's licenses to illegals.
[02:37:28.203 --> 02:37:36.148]  Even the President of the United States is prepared to reward lawbreakers, he said, referring to President Bush's proposal to legalize millions of illegal aliens in the U.S.
[02:37:36.848 --> 02:37:39.870]  Border security is the weakest link in our anti-terrorism effort.
[02:37:40.170 --> 02:37:41.851]  There isn't an anti-terrorism effort.
[02:37:41.951 --> 02:37:43.051]  They're doing it, sir.
[02:37:43.732 --> 02:37:52.917]  It's our Achilles' heel, said Corey, who claims billions of taxpayer dollars are being wasted on an immigration bureaucracy that does practically nothing to stop illegal alien traffic.
[02:37:56.827 --> 02:37:59.068]  And I've got other articles here.
[02:37:59.148 --> 02:38:01.269]  Border Patrol agents slam alien amnesty.
[02:38:01.449 --> 02:38:01.529]  U.S.
[02:38:01.569 --> 02:38:07.312]  law enforcement on the front lines are speaking their minds about the President's immigration moves.
[02:38:08.032 --> 02:38:14.135]  We had the President of the Border Patrol counsel on just a few days ago.
[02:38:14.155 --> 02:38:17.656]  Let me hit some other news.
[02:38:17.857 --> 02:38:18.637]  It's very important.
[02:38:18.677 --> 02:38:19.677]  Then we'll go to your calls.
[02:38:19.697 --> 02:38:20.598]  Just be patient, folks.
[02:38:20.618 --> 02:38:23.079]  I already went over the CBC article.
[02:38:25.609 --> 02:38:32.192]  It begins in the 1970s in Houston, Texas, when George W. Bush was just starting out in his family's two businesses of politics and oil.
[02:38:32.612 --> 02:38:36.013]  The powerful and very rich Bin Laden family helped fund his first venture into oil.
[02:38:36.534 --> 02:38:41.836]  The cozy friendship continued for decades after a terror attack at the barracks of Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 Americans.
[02:38:41.856 --> 02:38:45.457]  The Bin Laden family received the multi-billion dollar contract to rebuild it.
[02:38:46.678 --> 02:38:48.158]  And incredibly, George Bush Sr.
[02:38:48.218 --> 02:38:54.601]  was in business meeting at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Washington on the morning of September 11th with one of some of Bin Laden's brothers.
[02:38:56.221 --> 02:38:58.423]  And, of course, they flew him out of the country that day as well.
[02:38:58.963 --> 02:39:00.344]  Just thought I'd mention that again.
[02:39:02.626 --> 02:39:05.328]  Continuing, this is out of the Financial Times of London.
[02:39:05.648 --> 02:39:07.729]  Top 9-11 suspect was granted U.S.
[02:39:07.809 --> 02:39:11.712]  visa, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who they claim they captured and killed three separate times.
[02:39:11.752 --> 02:39:12.713]  He's CIA, folks.
[02:39:13.013 --> 02:39:15.455]  They've caught him capturing these people and quietly releasing them.
[02:39:15.475 --> 02:39:18.097]  And when they catch him, they go, oh, they were a CIA asset.
[02:39:19.045 --> 02:39:23.568]  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, alleged mastermind behind September 11th plot, was granted a visa to enter the U.S.
[02:39:23.928 --> 02:39:30.592]  just six weeks before the September 11th attacks in Washington and New York, according to new revelations from the Federal Commission whitewashing the attacks, I would add.
[02:39:31.272 --> 02:39:34.494]  Mr. Mohammed, who had previously been indicated in the U.S.
[02:39:34.974 --> 02:39:38.936]  for his alleged role in the earlier terrorist plot, was granted a visa through a U.S.
[02:39:38.976 --> 02:39:42.738]  consulate in Saudi Arabia after applying under a false Saudi passport.
[02:39:43.159 --> 02:39:47.121]  And we've had the former head of that embassy on to say that they were ordered by the CIA to let him in.
[02:39:49.574 --> 02:39:51.196]  Got to let the boys back in there.
[02:39:52.798 --> 02:39:54.019]  That goes on and on, too.
[02:39:54.179 --> 02:39:57.704]  The FBI paid for their houses, their cars, their credit cards, their plane tickets.
[02:39:57.724 --> 02:40:03.170]  They followed al-Qaeda out to an al-Qaeda summit in Malaysia where they were trying to stir up trouble there for the CIA.
[02:40:04.411 --> 02:40:08.196]  Out of all this, they get more power, more control.
[02:40:10.091 --> 02:40:13.212]  This is a very, very, very important story.
[02:40:13.312 --> 02:40:16.213]  Global unemployment at record high, Associated Press.
[02:40:16.713 --> 02:40:22.034]  More than 185 million people were jobless in 2003 as global unemployment levels hit record levels.
[02:40:22.915 --> 02:40:31.557]  A United Nations report on Thursday revealed 185.9 million people, about 6.2 of the total labor force, were out of work.
[02:40:32.097 --> 02:40:33.958]  The highest unemployment figure ever recorded.
[02:40:34.158 --> 02:40:36.679]  There were, however, only a marginal increase on 2002 figure.
[02:40:38.904 --> 02:40:40.744]  When 185.4 million were jobless.
[02:40:43.185 --> 02:40:46.106]  And folks, let's take U.S.
[02:40:46.166 --> 02:40:46.486]  numbers.
[02:40:46.646 --> 02:40:50.447]  They also do not count people who are off the unemployment rolls.
[02:40:50.547 --> 02:40:51.767]  And Europe doesn't do that either.
[02:40:51.827 --> 02:40:53.467]  So these numbers are much higher.
[02:40:53.487 --> 02:40:57.788]  Let me hit this.
[02:40:58.168 --> 02:40:59.769]  Two more stories and we'll go to your calls.
[02:41:00.389 --> 02:41:03.389]  Walton family, world's wealthiest family.
[02:41:03.429 --> 02:41:06.430]  This is from EIR, Executive Intelligence Review.
[02:41:07.665 --> 02:41:12.047]  The Walton family, which founded and today controls Walmart, lives off blood money.
[02:41:13.368 --> 02:41:20.692]  Operating jointly with the City of London, Wall Street bankers, Walmart's Walton family built a fortune through decimating the U.S.
[02:41:20.732 --> 02:41:22.453]  and world physical economies.
[02:41:23.934 --> 02:41:34.900]  It has applied ferocious systems which by driving wages and living standards ever lower beneath the level needed for existence and has sucked the lifeblood out of the population.
[02:41:35.480 --> 02:41:37.081]  This Walmart calls savings
[02:41:37.745 --> 02:41:38.185]  We're good to go.
[02:42:00.686 --> 02:42:13.120]  The Wall Street City of London financier oligarchs have financed and helped and in fact directed the development of Walmart since it was founded in 1962 by Sam Walton, the deceased patriarch of the Walton family.
[02:42:14.093 --> 02:42:23.401]  Among the Walton family's evil ventures, the Waltons are using their enormous leverage to carefully construct a major banking empire under the tight Walton family control.
[02:42:23.841 --> 02:42:29.806]  The principal bank is the Arkansas-based Arvest, owned by the Waltons, possessing $6.6 billion in assets.
[02:42:30.206 --> 02:42:39.354]  It is already one of the 75 largest banks in America, and as an adjunct to this, the Waltons would like to build a second banking network that will be under the ownership of the Walmart Stores.
[02:42:39.969 --> 02:42:45.733]  They're engaging in bankrolling of the neoconservative network, which is part of the Cheney system.
[02:42:46.374 --> 02:42:58.342]  For example, John Walton, who was worth more than $20 billion himself, was the largest single individual contributor to the neocon governor, Jeb Bush, in the 2002 Florida gubernatorial race, forking over $325,000 at a point in the race when Jeb utterly needed the cash.
[02:43:02.811 --> 02:43:14.213]  In addition to being the brother of the president, Jeb Bush is part of John Ashcroft's domestic fascist network with heavy interface from drug-linked Cuban networks.
[02:43:15.693 --> 02:43:31.196]  According to the 990PF tax form, the Walton Family Foundation, the family's philanthropic arm, funds some of the leading neocon utopia organization centers, including the Heritage Foundation, the Hudson's Institute, and the Cheney Operations Base at all.
[02:43:31.960 --> 02:43:35.104]  The Walton family is the largest financial force in America.
[02:43:35.164 --> 02:43:50.782]  In an effort to privatize the public school system through school vouchers, which would wreck public education, they would create a Walmart school mart that would result in the same quality of cheapness associated with Walmart store concept.
[02:43:52.165 --> 02:43:55.150]  Okay, I don't agree with ERI on several points here.
[02:43:55.270 --> 02:43:59.537]  Number one, the Rockefeller family dynasty in 1906 had over $6 billion in liquid cash.
[02:44:04.737 --> 02:44:09.218]  Six billion in today's numbers is over $4 trillion.
[02:44:09.898 --> 02:44:22.880]  The Rothschild family publicly owns over half of all of the Western world's central banks, estimated to be over $175 trillion.
[02:44:25.441 --> 02:44:30.961]  Bill Gates, the Waltons, they're all Johnny-come-lately mid-level elites, folks.
[02:44:32.362 --> 02:44:33.862]  Their billions are nothing
[02:44:34.591 --> 02:44:35.131]  The U.S.
[02:44:35.332 --> 02:44:39.735]  debt is $43 trillion now, according to the Dallas Morning News.
[02:44:41.376 --> 02:44:41.916]  $43 trillion.
[02:44:42.577 --> 02:44:44.558]  These are the type of numbers we're talking about to these people.
[02:44:44.898 --> 02:44:47.060]  This is just a sick joke.
[02:44:47.100 --> 02:44:50.402]  They own the universities, the banks, the roads.
[02:44:50.442 --> 02:44:51.703]  That's what privatization is all about.
[02:44:51.923 --> 02:44:54.425]  They say vouchers will wreak havoc on schools.
[02:44:55.366 --> 02:45:00.889]  No, it'll take public school money and take over the private schools and outlaw homeschooling.
[02:45:00.929 --> 02:45:01.510]  That's the plan.
[02:45:01.870 --> 02:45:03.011]  That's why vouchers are bad.
[02:45:04.449 --> 02:45:17.559]  Walmart from coast to coast is involved in anti-terror drills where the citizens are told to report voluntarily for a prize and practice under police view with guns, taking jelly beans that symbolize the forced inoculations.
[02:45:19.021 --> 02:45:26.086]  Walmart at their center up in Fayetteville has the FBI running their new echelon hooked-up control grid.
[02:45:28.188 --> 02:45:32.071]  Walmart owns, according to the Associated Press, 700 slave camps.
[02:45:34.582 --> 02:45:41.025]  In the BBC, 700 slave camps built onto prisons in China alone.
[02:45:41.945 --> 02:45:50.529]  But how you can feel good when you can't find anything made in America in the store because there's lots of American flags hanging around form over substance.
[02:45:51.730 --> 02:45:52.590]  Okay, let's go to calls.
[02:45:52.650 --> 02:45:53.630]  I'm going to go back in the news.
[02:45:53.970 --> 02:45:54.891]  Who's up first here?
[02:45:57.632 --> 02:45:58.933]  Dana in Texas, go ahead.
[02:45:58.973 --> 02:45:59.513]  You're on the air.
[02:46:00.632 --> 02:46:01.773]  Hi, this is Dana from Houston.
[02:46:01.973 --> 02:46:02.533]  Welcome, Dana.
[02:46:02.553 --> 02:46:09.416]  Hi, I was just calling to see if you had heard the story of the security guard out here in Freeport that was shot.
[02:46:09.476 --> 02:46:18.240]  This man was taking pictures of a, let's see, the BASF chemical plant, and the security guard went over to ask him what was going on and went to call for backup, and the guy shot him in the shoulder.
[02:46:19.981 --> 02:46:28.224]  The interesting part is this security guard now went on the news last night on Channel 2 and said that the FBI has come to him and asked him to change his story.
[02:46:30.727 --> 02:46:39.212]  Saying that they can see it in his eyes that he is actually wanting to tell somebody a different story and that he needs to get it off his chest, trying to say that he wasn't really shot.
[02:46:39.933 --> 02:46:42.114]  Did he say he saw a white guy?
[02:46:43.034 --> 02:46:48.077]  Actually, he said that he thinks he's of Middle Eastern descent.
[02:46:48.378 --> 02:46:52.160]  He said he was dark, he had a dark mustache, was in a white truck.
[02:46:53.856 --> 02:46:54.437]  Taking pictures.
[02:46:54.477 --> 02:47:06.624]  No, I haven't seen the story, but there have been cases of firefighters and police shooting themselves, finding pipe bombs, to be part of the new celebrity anti-terror system.
[02:47:06.984 --> 02:47:07.144]  Right.
[02:47:07.164 --> 02:47:08.064]  Well, see, that's what I was wondering.
[02:47:08.164 --> 02:47:10.686]  You see, in the first article, they say he was unarmed.
[02:47:10.846 --> 02:47:11.927]  That came out on Saturday.
[02:47:11.967 --> 02:47:12.987]  It happened Friday night.
[02:47:13.608 --> 02:47:19.291]  On Saturday, they say he was unarmed, and then now they're saying that the FBI is suspecting that he shot himself.
[02:47:20.575 --> 02:47:23.877]  I don't know.
[02:47:24.477 --> 02:47:33.301]  Well, I mean, I know the FBI killed some cops and people who said that there were bombs inside the building and it helped remove them.
[02:47:34.141 --> 02:47:37.183]  They killed detectives and others, tortured the living daylights out of them.
[02:47:37.223 --> 02:47:39.964]  Witnesses saw the FBI following them and the police had been threatened.
[02:47:41.205 --> 02:47:46.267]  But I don't know in this case because I don't have any of the details.
[02:47:46.730 --> 02:47:47.170]  Okay.
[02:47:47.230 --> 02:47:48.571]  Yeah, I just wanted to get that out there.
[02:47:48.591 --> 02:47:51.232]  I didn't know, you know, with Super Bowl weekend coming up and stuff, I didn't know.
[02:47:51.292 --> 02:47:55.314]  It just sounded a little fishy to me that they were trying to get him to change his tune like that.
[02:47:56.214 --> 02:47:57.315]  And I just wanted to bring it up.
[02:47:57.615 --> 02:47:57.975]  All right.
[02:47:58.015 --> 02:47:58.655]  Thank you for the call.
[02:47:58.715 --> 02:47:59.335]  Interesting point.
[02:47:59.355 --> 02:48:00.216]  I'll check into it.
[02:48:01.596 --> 02:48:02.737]  And who's up next now?
[02:48:05.298 --> 02:48:06.258]  Ruth in Pennsylvania.
[02:48:06.278 --> 02:48:06.719]  Go ahead.
[02:48:06.999 --> 02:48:07.439]  Hi, Alex.
[02:48:07.459 --> 02:48:12.181]  This relates coincidentally to your click shake Mohammed article that you just read.
[02:48:12.975 --> 02:48:19.496]  I've been seeing a couple times on cable this month, and I watched it a couple times, a movie called The Long Kiss Goodnight.
[02:48:20.117 --> 02:48:36.660]  It was made in 1996, and one and one half hour into this movie, it starts talking about 911-type scenarios that are exactly, and this was made in 1996, exactly like the real 911, right down to the number of people that will die.
[02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:40.641]  It stars Geena Davis and Samuel Jackson.
[02:48:40.901 --> 02:48:41.561]  It talks about
[02:48:42.159 --> 02:48:43.620]  And there's, yeah, I've seen it.
[02:48:43.680 --> 02:48:45.743]  And there's two ways to look at this.
[02:48:56.833 --> 02:49:12.139]  Why did Rupert Murdoch, who's in business with Larry Silverstein, the owner, why did he make a show two months before 9-11 where a secret government group hijacks a jet by remote control that crashed into the World Trade Center to, quote, get martial law?
[02:49:12.860 --> 02:49:14.581]  And that clips in Masters of Terror, by the way.
[02:49:14.841 --> 02:49:18.422]  Why did Phillips in 99 run a TV ad?
[02:49:18.462 --> 02:49:19.443]  I have the AP article about it.
[02:49:19.463 --> 02:49:20.323]  I haven't seen the TV ad.
[02:49:21.317 --> 02:49:26.859]  Where two F-16s bomb the World Trade Center, and then they say, Phillips, changing your world.
[02:49:27.519 --> 02:49:29.660]  Why do they do this?
[02:49:29.820 --> 02:49:31.641]  Why do they throw it in our face like this?
[02:49:31.681 --> 02:49:32.301]  That's a question.
[02:49:32.621 --> 02:49:33.541]  I have no idea.
[02:49:33.581 --> 02:49:43.845]  It makes me wonder, too, but this is in 96, and it even gives the number of the need for killing 4,000 people for the purpose to scare money out of Congress to fund CIA operations.
[02:49:43.865 --> 02:49:46.966]  It talks about Islamic pasties for these attacks.
[02:49:47.286 --> 02:49:48.166]  Hey, why did PBS...
[02:49:51.017 --> 02:49:53.778]  You know, put Silverstein up there bragging we blew the buildings up.
[02:49:53.838 --> 02:49:59.859]  I mean, it's a practice of hanging it out there in our face and laughing at us.
[02:50:00.199 --> 02:50:12.582]  The other thing I wanted to bring up to you that I thought was interesting, it's just a small point, but I was looking at a software advertisement that is advertising genealogy software, and they were giving examples of people's lineage, and they gave George Bush.
[02:50:12.922 --> 02:50:15.523]  George Bush and Colin Powell are cousins.
[02:50:16.109 --> 02:50:16.669]  No lie.
[02:50:17.029 --> 02:50:35.076]  They go back to Longshanks, the cruel king in England, and one of Longshanks' descendants impregnated a slave in Jamaica, which is Colin Powell's great-grandmother, which only goes to show you how they keep it all in the family because there's been a number of presidents in the United States, as you know, related to the Queen of England.
[02:50:35.096 --> 02:50:40.998]  According to Reuters, the Bushes could go back to England and demand title lands.
[02:50:41.078 --> 02:50:42.539]  They're that close to the royal family.
[02:50:45.040 --> 02:50:49.365]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:50:49.565 --> 02:50:53.930]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:50:56.596 --> 02:50:58.518]  This disaster is a new world order.
[02:50:58.619 --> 02:51:01.342]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:51:01.702 --> 02:51:05.928]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:51:05.988 --> 02:51:12.916]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:51:13.056 --> 02:51:15.059]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:51:15.439 --> 02:51:25.742]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:51:26.042 --> 02:51:31.423]  If you want to understand what the new rule order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:51:55.623 --> 02:52:03.151]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:52:03.451 --> 02:52:06.595]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.

[02:53:49.173 --> 02:53:50.673]  This show is documented.
[02:53:51.214 --> 02:53:53.995]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:53:54.376 --> 02:53:56.036]  Yeah, folks, we're back live.
[02:53:56.176 --> 02:53:58.058]  I don't want to disagree with the last caller.
[02:53:58.658 --> 02:54:11.125]  But Longshanks was around hundreds of years before the British even started coming into the Americas.
[02:54:11.185 --> 02:54:14.907]  So Longshanks couldn't have had a child with a slave from Jamaica.
[02:54:15.822 --> 02:54:18.024]  Now, are you saying that some of his descendants did?
[02:54:18.044 --> 02:54:20.727]  I don't know about Colin Powell's genealogy.
[02:54:20.767 --> 02:54:22.228]  I know about most presidents.
[02:54:23.209 --> 02:54:31.177]  According to Reuters, Al Gore is related to the now kicked out, obviously, French royalty and British royalty.
[02:54:31.597 --> 02:54:32.738]  But no one in U.S.
[02:54:32.778 --> 02:54:34.580]  history has had more connections than the Bushes.
[02:54:35.360 --> 02:54:37.923]  They, by the way, were Tories back during the war.
[02:54:37.943 --> 02:54:38.764]  They were pro-British.
[02:54:40.047 --> 02:54:41.528]  Even had to leave the country for a time.
[02:54:41.588 --> 02:54:46.251]  Came back in in the 1830s as part of public British agents trying to overthrow the country.
[02:54:47.452 --> 02:54:49.173]  Helped set up Skull and Bones at Yale.
[02:54:50.554 --> 02:54:51.935]  And yeah, this is who we're dealing with.
[02:54:51.995 --> 02:54:55.297]  British East India Company, corporate chieftains.
[02:54:55.617 --> 02:55:00.320]  And according to Reuters, they are very closely related cousins to Queen Elizabeth.
[02:55:01.261 --> 02:55:02.542]  The Walkers and the Bushes.
[02:55:02.662 --> 02:55:02.842]  So...
[02:55:03.820 --> 02:55:05.381]  They're not just not from Texas.
[02:55:05.401 --> 02:55:09.462]  They're not even from the U.S., folks.
[02:55:09.482 --> 02:55:10.383]  They're pieces of filth.
[02:55:10.463 --> 02:55:16.965]  Total gun-grabbing, open-border promoting, tax and spend, destroy America, neocons.
[02:55:17.005 --> 02:55:17.846]  So I hope you enjoy them.
[02:55:17.866 --> 02:55:19.546]  I hope you enjoy the end of America, folks.
[02:55:20.307 --> 02:55:22.407]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brad in Illinois.
[02:55:22.447 --> 02:55:22.988]  Last caller.
[02:55:23.008 --> 02:55:23.608]  Go ahead, Brad.
[02:55:23.968 --> 02:55:27.309]  I just made a couple comments for Jay, who called earlier about the voting.
[02:55:27.730 --> 02:55:30.931]  He should probably get a book called Vote Scam by the Collier Brothers.
[02:55:31.511 --> 02:55:34.033]  Now that exposes how they scammed the old elections.
[02:55:34.093 --> 02:55:34.353]  Right.
[02:55:34.973 --> 02:55:44.799]  If this is totally centralized now, before Republicans and Democrats would fight over their regions, now it's going to be all centralized.
[02:55:45.039 --> 02:55:52.703]  And he should also ask himself the question, why would he want to volunteer to be part of their system by swearing that he's a United States citizen?
[02:55:52.803 --> 02:55:54.564]  Go ask the county, his county clerk.
[02:55:55.049 --> 02:55:59.831]  For a legal definition of citizen of the United States or United States citizens, see if they'll even give it to them.
[02:56:00.231 --> 02:56:01.551]  Now I have a question for you, Alex.
[02:56:02.032 --> 02:56:05.693]  Last week you were talking about the 9-11 Twin Towers.
[02:56:06.913 --> 02:56:08.254]  Correct me if I'm wrong, please.
[02:56:08.954 --> 02:56:24.420]  When they showed the pictures of the rubble of the Twin Towers, these two gigantic office buildings, did you or anybody else see all kinds of evidence of desks, chairs, computer terminals, computer screens, filing cabinets?
[02:56:24.953 --> 02:56:31.140]  All the stuff that would normally be in big office buildings, did anybody see any of that in a pile of rubble?
[02:56:33.263 --> 02:56:35.646]  Well, it was all blown into little pieces, but yes.
[02:56:36.306 --> 02:56:38.549]  Well, I don't think... No, I'm sorry.
[02:56:38.569 --> 02:56:40.992]  I've had people tell me that I don't agree with that.
[02:56:41.400 --> 02:56:43.942]  Those buildings were both 110 stories tall.
[02:56:44.262 --> 02:56:49.525]  There was tons, should have been tons of that stuff in there.
[02:56:49.625 --> 02:56:53.327]  It was all coated with, I mean, are you saying that that stuff wasn't in the building?
[02:56:54.228 --> 02:56:57.630]  What I'm saying is that the pictures I've seen of the piles of rubble.
[02:56:58.126 --> 02:57:01.967]  You didn't see any evidence of any partial parts of Cher's desk.
[02:57:01.987 --> 02:57:04.427]  Well, that's because it was from hundreds of yards away.
[02:57:04.467 --> 02:57:06.568]  FEMA would arrest you if you tried to take photos up close.
[02:57:06.708 --> 02:57:08.588]  Well, that's what I mean, but you still couldn't see any.
[02:57:08.608 --> 02:57:10.848]  Even when you blow them up, you don't see them there in the rubble.
[02:57:11.609 --> 02:57:13.229]  Listen, I'm out of time.
[02:57:13.249 --> 02:57:14.189]  You can call me back tomorrow.
[02:57:14.209 --> 02:57:16.229]  We can talk more about that when you see what you're getting at there.
[02:57:17.150 --> 02:57:22.591]  A digital angel named John R. Block, the Board of Directors, former Secretary of the U.S.
[02:57:22.611 --> 02:57:24.171]  Department of Agriculture under Reagan,
[02:57:24.967 --> 02:57:28.268]  Ashcroft war justified even without weapons of mass destruction.
[02:57:29.129 --> 02:57:29.849]  And a lot more.
[02:57:29.929 --> 02:57:36.671]  Before I end this hour, if you believe in what we're doing, you want to wake people up, you want riveting, powerful, influential films, I've made ten of them.
[02:57:36.691 --> 02:57:42.193]  9-11 Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State 3 are the newest.
[02:57:42.233 --> 02:57:43.214]  They're incredibly good.
[02:57:43.294 --> 02:57:44.694]  I wrote a book about 9-11.
[02:57:45.014 --> 02:57:47.055]  Published another book about government-sponsored terror.

[02:58:35.416 --> 02:58:37.017]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
