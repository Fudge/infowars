[00:00:05.863 --> 00:00:06.503]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.163 --> 00:00:08.224]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.944 --> 00:00:10.045]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.705 --> 00:00:11.525]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.166]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:17.548]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:22.150]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.091]  Music
[00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:36.500]  Well, it's hard to believe, but it's already Friday.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.800]  Another week has blasted past us.
[00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:45.202]  Three hours, though, span out before us on this global transmission against tyranny.
[00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:46.762]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:47.522 --> 00:00:53.204]  The websites are infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, and prisonplanet.tv.
[00:00:56.084 --> 00:00:59.245]  And boy, have there been a lot of interesting developments today.
[00:00:59.285 --> 00:01:09.290]  We're finding out more of the reasons why Mr. Tenet resigned from the Central Destruction of American Agency.
[00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.791]  So we'll be going over that.
[00:01:11.811 --> 00:01:15.132]  Also, this is from the Scotsman, the big paper of Scotland.
[00:01:16.012 --> 00:01:16.372]  U.S.
[00:01:16.432 --> 00:01:19.934]  told Saudis to let Al-Qaeda gunmen escape.
[00:01:20.948 --> 00:01:22.108]  What a headline!
[00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:23.649]  Ha ha ha!
[00:01:24.089 --> 00:01:24.969]  It's not funny, though.
[00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:25.970]  They kill a lot of people.
[00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.112]  But in every case, you've got Taliban, Al-Qaeda leaders, 8,000 of them pinned down in Afghanistan.
[00:01:32.672 --> 00:01:38.394]  You fly them out and arrest innocent nobodies off the street and torture the daylights out of them for the television cameras.
[00:01:39.514 --> 00:01:43.536]  You've got 160 bin Ladens in the country when all of their air traffic's grounded.
[00:01:43.576 --> 00:01:47.337]  You fly them out under White House orders and protection.
[00:01:48.977 --> 00:01:51.558]  It's the same story over and over again.
[00:01:51.598 --> 00:01:56.340]  You got your Iraqis that you trained during the 80s who worked for the CIA.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.921]  They blow up Oklahoma City.
[00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:09.145]  And then you grab and drug your special forces officer, Mr. McVeigh, publicly give him the top MKUltra doctor, Jolly and West, which is admitted.
[00:02:09.165 --> 00:02:12.026]  This is the guy in the 77 MKUltra hearings.
[00:02:12.106 --> 00:02:14.427]  And openly they go, oh, this is his new federal doctor.
[00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:18.015]  It's the same story over and over again.
[00:02:18.296 --> 00:02:24.527]  The radical Muslim Arabs, my friends, are not even Muslims.
[00:02:24.567 --> 00:02:28.515]  They're CIA well paid terrorists.
[00:02:29.528 --> 00:02:30.449]  Well, not all of them.
[00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.211]  Some are MI5, MI6, Mossad.
[00:02:33.891 --> 00:02:39.255]  I'm just going off the Jerusalem Post and Associated Press and, you know, the admitted facts.
[00:02:39.335 --> 00:02:43.258]  We have it all posted on InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, you name it.
[00:02:43.278 --> 00:02:44.118]  The U.S.
[00:02:44.158 --> 00:02:48.581]  told Saudis to let al-Qaeda gunmen escape.
[00:02:49.422 --> 00:02:51.663]  And remember, the first day, that's what the news was saying.
[00:02:51.683 --> 00:02:53.505]  The people on the ground going, yeah, we had them pinned down.
[00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:54.405]  We were ordered to release them.
[00:02:56.327 --> 00:02:58.028]  Same story over and over again.
[00:03:00.408 --> 00:03:00.888]  Oh, but don't worry.
[00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.711]  Al-Qaeda always says what's needed right at the right time to help the globalists.
[00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:07.693]  You know, Saddam's going, I don't work with Al-Qaeda, and suddenly bin Laden takes its release.
[00:03:07.713 --> 00:03:08.193]  Yes, I do.
[00:03:08.253 --> 00:03:08.854]  Don't listen to him.
[00:03:08.874 --> 00:03:11.996]  Oh, that really, really helps things.
[00:03:12.696 --> 00:03:20.561]  Al-Qaeda's statement says high oil prices in Muslims' interest, and that, well, Al-Qaeda's kind of behind it all.
[00:03:21.062 --> 00:03:23.323]  Sure, the oil companies are registering record profits.
[00:03:23.363 --> 00:03:24.524]  They control OPEC.
[00:03:25.757 --> 00:03:26.758]  They love what's happening.
[00:03:26.798 --> 00:03:28.959]  Bush refuses to release the Strategic Oil Reserve.
[00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:32.801]  Wants to keep prices high because his entire cabinet is oil company people.
[00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:43.266]  But no, now the know-it-alls who don't even know how many continents there are, who the first president was, or who the vice president is, will go, I heard Bin Laden did it!
[00:03:43.906 --> 00:03:47.468]  But we're paying a lot of money for gas because of Bin Laden!
[00:03:48.348 --> 00:03:51.410]  Everything, it rained today because of Bin Laden!
[00:03:52.443 --> 00:03:54.324]  My neighbor didn't pay a parking ticket.
[00:03:54.364 --> 00:03:56.446]  I bet that's an Al-Qaeda activity.
[00:03:56.506 --> 00:03:58.307]  I better call the police.
[00:03:58.467 --> 00:04:00.208]  I mean, I'm not joking around about this.
[00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:04.711]  By the way, they're admitting something we've known for two-plus years.
[00:04:06.032 --> 00:04:17.719]  Every transaction you make through a big company, every house you buy, car you buy, you're being run through the Patriot Act database for taxes, for child support.
[00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.761]  It has nothing to do with terrorism.
[00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:23.222]  This is MSNBC.
[00:04:23.602 --> 00:04:26.564]  New horrible photos have been released of dead U.S.
[00:04:26.584 --> 00:04:28.785]  troops laying around a Humvee that got blown up.
[00:04:30.387 --> 00:04:31.367]  But again, here's that headline.
[00:04:31.387 --> 00:04:32.728]  The Patriot Search.
[00:04:33.208 --> 00:04:34.149]  Buying a home.
[00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:35.570]  Prepare to pay.
[00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:36.610]  You have to pay for it.
[00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:41.333]  To have your name checked against a government list of suspected terrorists.
[00:04:41.574 --> 00:04:41.754]  Oh.
[00:04:42.754 --> 00:04:43.815]  And, of course, for all crimes.
[00:04:44.475 --> 00:04:46.817]  Bill Clinton says he really supports Bush, as usual.
[00:04:46.837 --> 00:04:47.437]  Of course he does.
[00:04:47.737 --> 00:04:48.438]  Of course he does!
[00:04:50.035 --> 00:04:50.996]  And much more.
[00:04:51.176 --> 00:04:54.698]  It's just a gigantic broadcast lined up for you.
[00:04:54.718 --> 00:04:56.679]  A lot of other news items and all the details.
[00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.960]  Straight ahead.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.560]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.405 --> 00:05:02.925]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:03.086 --> 00:05:06.186]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.326 --> 00:05:10.228]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:14.489]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:18.610]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.631]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.771 --> 00:05:24.092]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:05:24.112 --> 00:05:25.192]  The medical bills...
[00:05:26.813 --> 00:05:28.834]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.974 --> 00:05:32.015]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:32.195 --> 00:05:35.077]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.557 --> 00:05:41.660]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.721]  We're good to go.
[00:06:01.983 --> 00:06:06.487]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:06:06.827 --> 00:06:10.930]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:11.771]  We listened.
[00:06:12.071 --> 00:06:17.055]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:06:17.336 --> 00:06:17.816]  We listened.
[00:06:18.196 --> 00:06:21.239]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:22.200]  We listened.
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.323]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power hours.
[00:06:26.343 --> 00:06:27.183]  We're good to go.
[00:06:51.385 --> 00:06:52.006]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:52.026 --> 00:06:53.247]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:02.805 --> 00:07:08.290]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.953]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:07:13.194 --> 00:07:20.219]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:26.705]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:26.845 --> 00:07:28.066]  There are no side effects.
[00:07:28.206 --> 00:07:30.447]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:07:45.174 --> 00:07:48.275]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:07:48.295 --> 00:07:48.335]  866-885-6625.
[00:07:48.355 --> 00:07:48.435]  866-885-6625.
[00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:49.616]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:49.876]  Call today.
[00:07:49.956 --> 00:07:50.976]  Big Brother.
[00:07:51.016 --> 00:07:51.496]  Mainstream media.
[00:07:51.536 --> 00:07:52.597]  Government cover-ups.
[00:07:52.617 --> 00:07:53.737]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.356 --> 00:08:13.216]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.236 --> 00:08:17.838]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.079 --> 00:08:22.180]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.101 --> 00:08:35.066]  That's right, we're now in the second segment of Global Transmission Against Tyranny as we blast out on the AM and FM dial from Providence, Rhode Island to Los Angeles, California, from Austin, Texas to Kansas City, Missouri.
[00:08:36.255 --> 00:08:44.419]  Simulcasting on Global Shortwave from 11 to 2 Central during the day at 94.75 and at night from 9 to midnight at 32.10.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.623]  And, of course, at prisonplanet.com, prisonplanet.tv, and infowars.com.
[00:08:53.264 --> 00:08:55.185]  Okay, I'm about to get into these headlines.
[00:08:55.305 --> 00:08:55.565]  U.S.
[00:08:55.605 --> 00:08:57.626]  told Saudis to let al-Qaeda government escape.
[00:08:57.946 --> 00:08:59.547]  That's from the Scotsman, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:01.216 --> 00:09:04.278]  Al-Qaeda says the oil price is being high as good.
[00:09:04.338 --> 00:09:05.739]  See, it's not Bush or the oil companies.
[00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:06.839]  It's Al-Qaeda.
[00:09:06.859 --> 00:09:07.920]  They do everything bad.
[00:09:08.801 --> 00:09:10.522]  Some new horrific pictures of dead U.S.
[00:09:10.562 --> 00:09:11.643]  troops will be going over.
[00:09:12.563 --> 00:09:15.985]  When you buy a house, buy a car, anything, you're checked under the Patriot Act.
[00:09:16.526 --> 00:09:19.328]  Bill Clinton says that he loves George Bush, basically.
[00:09:19.928 --> 00:09:21.989]  We'll be going over all of this.
[00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:28.574]  But I was driving over here today to the studio, and I thought to myself, you know,
[00:09:29.631 --> 00:09:35.353]  The troops go to Iraq and they're given deadly experimental vaccines that the government knows are killing people.
[00:09:35.413 --> 00:09:40.775]  They've known for at least 13 years that the anthrax shot they give kills a lot of people.
[00:09:41.316 --> 00:09:42.116]  And it's been looked at.
[00:09:42.136 --> 00:09:44.057]  It seems that it's by design.
[00:09:44.837 --> 00:09:47.038]  And they know the smallpox shot is very dangerous.
[00:09:48.298 --> 00:10:01.189]  And they know that depleted uranium, according to their own top scientists, their own handbooks from the 80s and 90s, will kill you if you breathe it, just because of the heavy metal nature, toxic nature of it, and not to mention the radiation.
[00:10:03.011 --> 00:10:06.974]  And this time they've basically bombarded all the Republican Guard installations.
[00:10:07.014 --> 00:10:08.816]  That's where our troops then moved into.
[00:10:11.045 --> 00:10:22.594]  And there's been French, Dutch, Spanish, Australian, American scientists, major institutions, universities over there, Geiger counters showing high radiation.
[00:10:23.194 --> 00:10:24.395]  They've tested the blood.
[00:10:24.475 --> 00:10:31.681]  Even the New York Daily News paid for this a few months ago and found that they had thousands of times the safe levels of uranium in them.
[00:10:32.321 --> 00:10:36.124]  Some of them had two rims of radiation.
[00:10:36.164 --> 00:10:37.345]  That will kill you.
[00:10:38.107 --> 00:10:40.368]  And indeed, thousands have died from the first Gulf War.
[00:10:40.408 --> 00:10:41.268]  Thousands more died.
[00:10:42.028 --> 00:10:45.449]  We've had the top scientists from the Army and others on this broadcast.
[00:10:46.729 --> 00:10:48.450]  But that's not an issue on the nightly news.
[00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:52.491]  If they mention it, they go, is depleting uranium perhaps a little bad for you?
[00:10:52.511 --> 00:10:53.511]  Let's talk to the government.
[00:10:53.671 --> 00:10:54.631]  Oh, it's wonderful.
[00:10:54.771 --> 00:10:55.771]  It's very nutritious.
[00:10:57.552 --> 00:10:58.652]  I was just thinking about that.
[00:10:58.672 --> 00:11:00.092]  To the military, to the police.
[00:11:00.793 --> 00:11:02.313]  I mean, you'll serve this system.
[00:11:02.333 --> 00:11:06.914]  You'll do whatever they say as they admittedly document it.
[00:11:08.356 --> 00:11:10.698]  Poison the living daylights out of you with pleasure.
[00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:31.817]  I mean, they knew that Agent Orange caused massive skin cancer and internal cancer of your breathing and huge levels of birth defects, basically minced the chromosomes when the male is producing them in the male gland that does that.
[00:11:32.878 --> 00:11:33.879]  They knowingly did that.
[00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:37.776]  I mean, how many cases of this, but you just accept it?
[00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:50.966]  And then, in the last month, I've probably covered ten mainstream news articles out of India, Africa, even England, where they go, my goodness, we found bizarre cancer viruses that were artificially engineered in major vaccines.
[00:11:51.407 --> 00:11:54.849]  My goodness, we found sterilization chemicals that sterilize all the women that are given those.
[00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:56.791]  My goodness, we found this, we found that.
[00:11:58.032 --> 00:11:59.834]  But we still take the vaccines.
[00:11:59.874 --> 00:12:13.384]  So if the government loves you so much, police, why do they tell you to take the same vaccines that us, the little people, the civilians, not the big officials, not the big authorities like you are, why then do they push it on you and your children too?
[00:12:14.185 --> 00:12:15.826]  You mean nothing to them.
[00:12:15.946 --> 00:12:17.087]  They hate your guts.
[00:12:17.527 --> 00:12:20.370]  You go, who is just pure evil and hates people's guts?
[00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:27.115]  Well, to be ruthless, to be totally powerful, to exercise power, to be in those positions of control, that has to be your nature.
[00:12:27.771 --> 00:12:28.971]  That's what history has shown.
[00:12:29.432 --> 00:12:32.973]  And you sit there in a naive fashion, buying all the propaganda.
[00:12:33.593 --> 00:12:38.915]  So you better investigate what they're doing to you, not just to us, the little people.
[00:12:39.355 --> 00:12:43.317]  The civilians, as you like to call us, here in the new military dictatorship.
[00:12:44.957 --> 00:12:51.660]  I just wanted to warn you about this, because different types of cancers are up from 200 to 500, in some cases to several thousand percent.
[00:12:52.751 --> 00:12:57.153]  There's all these myriad new cancers, bizarre new designer cancers.
[00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:58.273]  And I told you the story.
[00:12:59.114 --> 00:13:07.657]  I hadn't been in in years, but I went ahead and went in about a year ago for a doctor's checkup for our family doctor here in Austin.
[00:13:08.918 --> 00:13:15.660]  And I went in, and the doctor, four or five years ago last time I saw him, he didn't really believe the New World Order, made jokes at me.
[00:13:17.521 --> 00:13:18.922]  This was about six, seven years ago.
[00:13:19.062 --> 00:13:21.483]  And so I go in there last year, about a year ago now,
[00:13:22.879 --> 00:13:27.903]  And he goes, Alex, let me just tell you, you know, I volunteer to one of the big regional clinics.
[00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:28.924]  You know, we do that.
[00:13:30.245 --> 00:13:35.510]  And, you know, it's part of our American Medical Association guidelines.
[00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.051]  We have to, you know, go volunteer and stuff.
[00:13:37.812 --> 00:13:39.713]  And he said, I couldn't believe it.
[00:13:40.234 --> 00:13:44.297]  You know, it's been banned since the early 80s, the polio vaccine, the oral one.
[00:13:44.717 --> 00:13:46.018]  You can only give it in the third world.
[00:13:46.058 --> 00:13:50.062]  And he goes, there, I don't know why, but he goes, you know, it's got live SV40 cancer virus.
[00:13:50.832 --> 00:13:53.574]  Which gives you just a whole slew of interesting cancers.
[00:13:55.876 --> 00:13:57.938]  And he started going, I can't believe it.
[00:13:58.358 --> 00:14:01.360]  I was there watching him give it to the school children.
[00:14:02.161 --> 00:14:03.402]  He goes, it's incredible.
[00:14:03.502 --> 00:14:04.823]  And I go, well, can't I use your name?
[00:14:04.903 --> 00:14:06.424]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:14:06.484 --> 00:14:07.685]  I just want you to know it's true.
[00:14:07.865 --> 00:14:09.146]  What you're saying is true.
[00:14:10.147 --> 00:14:12.969]  It's not just the old vaccines, boys and girls.
[00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:15.892]  That's just vaccines that have been exposed.
[00:14:15.972 --> 00:14:16.832]  It's the new ones.
[00:14:17.953 --> 00:14:18.194]  I mean...
[00:14:19.841 --> 00:14:25.466]  I know that in the last few weeks I just mention every hour on the hour, by the way, there's cancer viruses in your vaccine.
[00:14:25.966 --> 00:14:28.348]  By the way, there's sodium fluoride is deadly.
[00:14:29.149 --> 00:14:31.190]  By the way, aspartame is wood alcohol.
[00:14:32.071 --> 00:14:35.634]  By the way, I've got to warn you.
[00:14:35.654 --> 00:14:39.257]  I mean, come on!
[00:14:39.317 --> 00:14:40.958]  This is out of control!
[00:14:41.158 --> 00:14:42.299]  It's admitted!
[00:14:42.859 --> 00:14:44.841]  Why are we putting up with this?
[00:14:47.363 --> 00:14:48.184]  Oh, my goodness.
[00:14:50.126 --> 00:14:53.608]  So, and there's a move in England to make you take the vaccines.
[00:14:53.668 --> 00:14:56.750]  The feds tried to pass state laws to make you take vaccines.
[00:14:57.271 --> 00:15:04.315]  Now they did pass it federally in the Homeland Security Package a year and a half ago under a civil emergency.
[00:15:04.955 --> 00:15:06.956]  But now they're declaring civil emergencies.
[00:15:08.197 --> 00:15:09.778]  In Georgia, no protesting.
[00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:12.480]  Civil emergencies in Paris, no protesting for Bush.
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.121]  See, they're, you know, mayors.
[00:15:14.141 --> 00:15:15.182]  We hear about it all the time.
[00:15:15.422 --> 00:15:19.044]  Oh, it was a civil emergency, so we don't need warrants to search your houses and
[00:15:19.842 --> 00:15:21.423]  You've got to sign an agreement we can.
[00:15:21.663 --> 00:15:23.024]  This is all going on.
[00:15:24.785 --> 00:15:37.991]  And so we're going to enter a system where we knowingly understand that they're injecting us with a cancer virus that lays dormant in most of us, that is designed to be triggered once our cells have divided a certain number of times.
[00:15:39.732 --> 00:15:41.513]  It's very complex DNA sequencing.
[00:15:41.913 --> 00:15:47.576]  It then activates, and the protein sheath comes off of it, and you get cancer.
[00:15:48.317 --> 00:15:55.579]  Now, if you're really healthy and eat a lot of the proper foods and get a lot of antioxidants and exercise, your body can continue to fight that off.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:01.581]  But at a certain point, it plugs in and you get all these different horrible types of cancers.
[00:16:01.621 --> 00:16:06.323]  These designer cancers are accelerated forms of leukemia.
[00:16:06.763 --> 00:16:13.145]  Weird, what's described as purple yogurt type cancers that grow in your sinus into your brain.
[00:16:13.165 --> 00:16:15.005]  Weird skin cancers.
[00:16:15.406 --> 00:16:16.466]  I mean, all of this...
[00:16:18.067 --> 00:16:22.170]  I've read, I've sat up so many nights reading the prestigious medical reports.
[00:16:22.591 --> 00:16:28.796]  You know, they've had big symposiums in Chicago with medical experts and hundreds of scientists.
[00:16:28.836 --> 00:16:31.878]  And that's just the cancer viruses.
[00:16:32.378 --> 00:16:38.944]  Oh, don't ever forget that they tell you they've taken the thimerosal mercury out of the vaccines.
[00:16:39.984 --> 00:16:47.050]  What they did is they took it out of some of the vaccines or reduced it, but then in the MMR shot,
[00:16:47.907 --> 00:16:48.787]  This is mainstream news.
[00:16:48.807 --> 00:16:50.028]  This came out just about six months ago.
[00:16:50.368 --> 00:17:06.756]  In the MMR shot, in the flu shot, and a few others that they really push, that most people take, that they try to push on the parents, they went up 215 times in the level of what it was.
[00:17:08.437 --> 00:17:11.218]  I mean, this is so cold-blooded.
[00:17:11.438 --> 00:17:15.400]  Remember about three months ago, ABC News finally reported, and it was just a little blurb,
[00:17:16.431 --> 00:17:17.072]  On their website.
[00:17:17.092 --> 00:17:18.152]  It wasn't on their newscast.
[00:17:19.073 --> 00:17:21.535]  And it was CDC documents released from 2000.
[00:17:22.756 --> 00:17:23.997]  Just released earlier this year.
[00:17:25.298 --> 00:17:27.599]  And it said, they have the corporate minutes.
[00:17:27.719 --> 00:17:29.060]  I wouldn't give this to my granddaughter.
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:29.761]  This is deadly.
[00:17:29.801 --> 00:17:31.422]  Millions have been brain damaged by it.
[00:17:31.742 --> 00:17:32.943]  Well, we've got to cover this up.
[00:17:32.983 --> 00:17:33.904]  We can't let people know.
[00:17:33.924 --> 00:17:36.246]  It's just admitted.
[00:17:36.866 --> 00:17:39.188]  They know what they're doing to us.
[00:17:40.265 --> 00:17:41.206]  And so, you know what?
[00:17:41.826 --> 00:17:42.867]  It's easy to be lazy.
[00:17:42.927 --> 00:17:44.068]  It's easy to be in denial.
[00:17:44.469 --> 00:17:47.011]  I mean, they're publicly coming forward with a new national draft.
[00:17:47.031 --> 00:17:48.112]  They're still in denial about that.
[00:17:48.172 --> 00:17:56.559]  So it's easy driving along in your Lexus or your police car, you're a member of the establishment, whatever little strata you see yourself as.
[00:17:56.879 --> 00:17:59.521]  It's easy out there teeing off at the golf club.
[00:17:59.561 --> 00:18:04.445]  You feel like you've hit the elite level when you're nothing in the real strata.
[00:18:04.505 --> 00:18:06.327]  You don't own the machines that print the money.
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:13.782]  And if your family didn't found the universities, and if your name isn't on the bioweapons labs, then you're nothing.
[00:18:14.922 --> 00:18:16.683]  But you feel like you're a member of the elite.
[00:18:16.763 --> 00:18:17.703]  Nothing can touch you.
[00:18:17.743 --> 00:18:17.963]  Why?
[00:18:18.023 --> 00:18:18.883]  We wouldn't do that.
[00:18:18.943 --> 00:18:19.203]  Why?
[00:18:19.783 --> 00:18:21.484]  I'm the head of the Kiwanis Club.
[00:18:21.644 --> 00:18:22.624]  We're the system.
[00:18:22.684 --> 00:18:23.905]  Nobody's like that.
[00:18:26.425 --> 00:18:27.546]  I just got a call today.
[00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:29.926]  Our granddaughter's five years old.
[00:18:29.946 --> 00:18:32.727]  She's got an advanced new form of bizarre cancer.
[00:18:35.548 --> 00:18:38.349]  I heard that Alex talk about it, but it just can't be true.
[00:18:38.369 --> 00:18:42.032]  We're getting a new granddaughter.
[00:18:42.352 --> 00:18:46.995]  My daughter's pregnant again, but I guess we won't tell my daughter not to give her the vaccines.
[00:18:47.396 --> 00:18:52.439]  We'll just go bury our little granddaughter and give vaccines to the other ones.
[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.081]  He said, I'm used to driving Lexus.
[00:18:55.181 --> 00:18:55.982]  I live in a $500,000 house.
[00:18:58.503 --> 00:19:01.945]  I'm part of the system and there's no evil people running things.
[00:19:01.965 --> 00:19:04.026]  There's no giant eugenics program.
[00:19:04.627 --> 00:19:06.968]  I'm just going to ignore what Alex Jones says.
[00:19:07.248 --> 00:19:08.429]  It's so much easier.
[00:19:08.489 --> 00:19:11.410]  I'm not going to investigate because I'm a cowardly piece of filth.
[00:19:12.771 --> 00:19:14.232]  I don't care about my family.
[00:19:14.252 --> 00:19:16.753]  I mean, that's you.
[00:19:17.614 --> 00:19:19.755]  And you don't like me because I sit here and warn you.
[00:19:20.335 --> 00:19:21.456]  Please don't jump off the cliff.
[00:19:21.736 --> 00:19:23.597]  Please don't stick your hand in the garbage disposal.
[00:19:24.224 --> 00:19:26.765]  You know, please, please don't take that cyanide.
[00:19:26.785 --> 00:19:29.627]  I'm just here going, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it.
[00:19:29.967 --> 00:19:31.648]  Listen to me, please, please listen to me.
[00:19:31.828 --> 00:19:33.428]  Please, the government's behind the terrorism.
[00:19:33.769 --> 00:19:34.429]  Please listen to me.
[00:19:34.449 --> 00:19:35.890]  They're behind all this horrible stuff.
[00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:37.310]  Please, please study history.
[00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:38.291]  Please study what's happening now.
[00:19:38.331 --> 00:19:39.171]  Here's the documents, please.
[00:19:39.191 --> 00:19:40.452]  I don't want to see that.
[00:19:40.572 --> 00:19:42.373]  I'm a member of the system.
[00:19:43.313 --> 00:19:44.434]  Okay, you're a member of the system.
[00:19:44.894 --> 00:19:45.914]  All right, okay, I heard you.
[00:19:46.374 --> 00:19:47.435]  Okay, cops, I heard you.
[00:19:47.615 --> 00:19:48.355]  Okay, don't listen to me.
[00:19:48.415 --> 00:19:48.956]  Take the shots.
[00:19:48.976 --> 00:19:49.396]  Just go ahead.
[00:19:51.207 --> 00:19:53.687]  I've listened to him, but he gets a little upset, you know.
[00:19:54.208 --> 00:19:56.348]  Oh, I shouldn't get upset about them giving you cancer?
[00:19:56.668 --> 00:19:57.108]  Okay.
[00:19:57.508 --> 00:19:59.068]  Okay, I'll just shut up about it, okay?
[00:19:59.168 --> 00:20:00.529]  We'll come back and talk about other stuff.
[00:20:01.869 --> 00:20:02.529]  Hello, folks.

[00:21:01.205 --> 00:21:02.726]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:21:02.886 --> 00:21:04.026]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:21:04.207 --> 00:21:07.628]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:21:07.728 --> 00:21:08.208]  Phenome.
[00:21:08.469 --> 00:21:15.592]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:21:15.912 --> 00:21:16.032]  Any
[00:21:16.052 --> 00:21:19.955]  ETA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:21:20.095 --> 00:21:20.555]  Fragrance?
[00:21:20.915 --> 00:21:25.678]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:21:25.818 --> 00:21:30.501]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:21:30.721 --> 00:21:33.283]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[00:21:33.543 --> 00:21:36.945]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.

[00:22:01.866 --> 00:22:04.929]  Hi, this is Jack Brownrigg with a gold alert from Midas Resources.
[00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.411]  Folks, it's time to shed your complacency.
[00:22:07.771 --> 00:22:10.372]  Gold has seldom, if ever, been a better buy.
[00:22:10.732 --> 00:22:15.294]  Midas Resources is now in a position to potentially show you considerable profits.
[00:22:15.494 --> 00:22:17.255]  But you have to act now!
[00:22:17.455 --> 00:22:23.637]  With $10 collector gold coins at the closest price to melt I've seen in my 24 years in the business.
[00:22:24.048 --> 00:22:30.570]  These are the same coins that are likely to soon command substantial premium prices as they have in the past.
[00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:34.371]  We can deliver them to you now with minimal downside risk.
[00:22:34.591 --> 00:22:38.052]  Or we can let you buy them later at a considerable higher price.
[00:22:38.472 --> 00:22:40.753]  Don't buy them later, folks.
[00:22:41.113 --> 00:22:41.933]  Do it now.
[00:22:42.193 --> 00:22:51.536]  That's $10 collector gold coins, $10 and $20 collector gold coins, at the nearest of melt in my 24 years in this business called Midas Resources.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:52.020]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:59.026]  That's Midas at 800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.707 --> 00:23:06.992]  Maca is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[00:23:07.352 --> 00:23:11.436]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[00:23:11.956 --> 00:23:19.182]  Only recently has science discovered that maca is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[00:23:19.702 --> 00:23:27.048]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels.
[00:23:27.408 --> 00:23:29.630]  Increased libido, which helps prevent impotence.
[00:23:29.971 --> 00:23:33.233]  Relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort.
[00:23:33.634 --> 00:23:36.796]  Helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and night sweats.
[00:23:37.076 --> 00:23:39.999]  It also helps prevent osteoporosis and joint pain.
[00:23:40.479 --> 00:23:48.684]  Get your maca from Cliff Scott Enterprises at a price and quality that few can match because we get our maca fresh from the growers in Peru.

[00:23:52.065 --> 00:23:52.266]  Music
[00:24:09.344 --> 00:24:14.448]  You know, a word to the wise is sufficient on the vaccine situation.
[00:24:15.349 --> 00:24:20.232]  And, you know, I'll give you that hypothetical of the grandpa who thinks he's part of the establishment.
[00:24:21.674 --> 00:24:23.955]  All around him, his family's dying from this stuff.
[00:24:25.497 --> 00:24:29.159]  And it's just time to wake up to what's happening.
[00:24:29.199 --> 00:24:32.882]  Let's get into the other news, and we'll go to your calls coming up in the next segment at 800-259-9231.
[00:24:37.426 --> 00:24:37.787]  That's 800-259-9231.
[00:24:37.887 --> 00:24:38.208]  U.S.
[00:24:40.192 --> 00:24:45.362]  told Saudis to let Al-Qaeda gunmen escape.
[00:24:46.425 --> 00:24:48.529]  That's the Scotsman, the big paper of Scotland.
[00:24:49.361 --> 00:24:59.651]  Saudi authorities gave safe passage to three al-Qaeda gunmen after they killed ten of the hostages they were holding at a hotel in the oil hub of Khobar, a senior security official said.
[00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:03.174]  The Saudi official said upon hearing hostages had been killed, U.S.
[00:25:03.214 --> 00:25:07.378]  officials advised the Saudis that letting the militants go would avert a booger catastrophe.
[00:25:08.279 --> 00:25:08.579]  The U.S.
[00:25:08.639 --> 00:25:12.163]  Embassy in Riyadh did not have immediate comment on the Saudi official's account, which...
[00:25:12.859 --> 00:25:14.340]  Dovetail with witnesses' accounts.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:25.727]  Officials of the Saudi Interior Ministry had said that three used hostages as human shields to escape Saudi commandos on Sunday, and a fourth attacker said to be the ringleader was captured.
[00:25:26.408 --> 00:25:29.189]  The officials said the three walked away at about 2.20 a.m.
[00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:32.412]  on Sunday, hours before 80 commandos landed on the roof of the hotel.
[00:25:32.432 --> 00:25:37.715]  A helicopter began knocking on the hostages' doors to let them know they were free to leave.
[00:25:39.528 --> 00:25:47.196]  Reporters less than a block away from the Oasis compound housing, the hotel saw bullets streaking over the heads of the direction of the complex.
[00:25:47.576 --> 00:25:55.564]  The official said that was machine gun fire from one of the two accomplices who were in a car not far from the site and were covering the three men's escape.
[00:25:57.847 --> 00:26:01.911]  The attackers walked across the compound, stole a van, and fled Cobard, a nearby police station.
[00:26:02.839 --> 00:26:04.981]  Damn, ma'am, the official said.
[00:26:05.021 --> 00:26:12.427]  They then abandoned the vehicle for a car commandeered at gunpoint from a Saudi driver and drove off with the police in pursuit.
[00:26:13.008 --> 00:26:17.351]  The three left behind a fourth militant because they thought he was dead, the official said.
[00:26:17.391 --> 00:26:21.575]  Saudi authorities had reported the gunmen they had in custody were wounded.
[00:26:22.603 --> 00:26:33.048]  The escape of the three gunmen who killed 22 people, including a Briton, in a shooting rampage that began at two oil industry offices compounds and ended 25 hours later has stunned Saudis and expatriates.
[00:26:33.609 --> 00:26:38.991]  Many were wondering how the militants could have slipped away in an area blistering with hundreds of troops.
[00:26:40.152 --> 00:26:48.316]  The reason the Saudi government has given is a sketchy account of what happened and that it does not want to be seen as negotiating with terrorists.
[00:26:49.937 --> 00:26:50.417]  Now again,
[00:26:51.423 --> 00:26:56.887]  The Russians, in what, eight and a half years, couldn't take over Afghanistan with over a million men.
[00:26:58.889 --> 00:27:04.213]  But magically, with a couple hundred thousand troops, the globalists went in in a month.
[00:27:05.994 --> 00:27:17.243]  And the Northern Alliance, who had part of the northern area of the country, had all their big guns up there, and they were not allowed to pound with their artillery guns.
[00:27:18.722 --> 00:27:26.407]  The embankments, they would have three rings around a town or a base, so-called Al-Qaeda, Al-Si'aida would.
[00:27:28.548 --> 00:27:33.112]  And in the front line would be conscripts, goat herders, shoemakers, cobblers, and people like that.
[00:27:33.552 --> 00:27:40.417]  And the next line would be some Taliban low-level fighters, and then in the central area would be the Arab fighters, the controllers.
[00:27:41.503 --> 00:27:45.287]  And the Northern Alliance pointed out that our government would not bomb or attack the Arab fighters.
[00:27:45.828 --> 00:27:51.274]  Then C-130s, this has been all over the news, New Yorker, Times of London, even Fox News had to admit it.
[00:27:51.294 --> 00:27:56.140]  San Francisco Chronicle interviewed colonels who said we had them in our sights, weren't allowed to get them.
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:02.567]  Then helicopters would land, fly them to a nearby airbase, load them on C-130s with American pilots and fly them out.
[00:28:04.267 --> 00:28:06.569]  We're good to go.
[00:28:07.129 --> 00:28:07.930]  We're good to go.
[00:28:31.098 --> 00:28:32.159]  There's another example.
[00:28:32.179 --> 00:28:35.081]  Of course, 160 of the bin Ladens flown out on 9-11.
[00:28:36.101 --> 00:28:40.324]  On the day after 9-11, the day after that, when all of their air traffic was grounded.
[00:28:40.784 --> 00:28:46.327]  I've been saying 144 because that's what the Miami Herald and other Miami papers reported days after 9-11.
[00:28:47.108 --> 00:28:51.811]  FBI and others were there trying to bust the bin Ladens, and U.S.
[00:28:52.391 --> 00:28:55.053]  Special Forces type guys in black suits showed up,
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:59.623]  I was in a little machine guns under their jackets and said, back off, get them on the planes.
[00:28:59.903 --> 00:29:01.665]  We have orders from the president.
[00:29:02.205 --> 00:29:04.527]  And they loaded all his business partners up and flew them out.
[00:29:06.108 --> 00:29:07.969]  So that's your America.
[00:29:08.009 --> 00:29:09.110]  That's who runs things.
[00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:13.113]  Al-Qaeda admittedly was set up by the CIA in 1979.
[00:29:17.785 --> 00:29:29.428]  And as late as 1999, a Senate report by Republicans documented how Bin Laden was paid hundreds of millions of dollars by the Clinton administration to attack the Serbs in Kosovo.
[00:29:29.628 --> 00:29:32.909]  So when the Serbs fought back, they could say, oh, look, they're evil, and go in and take over.
[00:29:33.449 --> 00:29:34.669]  He's the fire starter.
[00:29:34.709 --> 00:29:35.669]  He's the boogeyman.
[00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:38.090]  Use a Star Wars analogy.
[00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:39.690]  A children's movie can figure this out.
[00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:46.672]  Count Dooku really works for the emperor, and his job is to go create the crisis so the empire can expand.
[00:29:47.609 --> 00:29:49.311]  A children's movie can figure this out.
[00:29:49.331 --> 00:29:50.472]  Can adults figure this out?
[00:29:51.833 --> 00:29:52.734]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.235 --> 00:29:54.836]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.757 --> 00:29:58.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:07.712]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:07.832 --> 00:31:10.694]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:10.794 --> 00:31:17.497]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.

[00:32:01.164 --> 00:32:02.885]  They begin with a civil service.
[00:32:02.905 --> 00:32:04.467]  To rescue the hostages to have.
[00:32:04.707 --> 00:32:05.948]  It is headed for.
[00:32:05.968 --> 00:32:08.149]  To the war on terror until they are credited.
[00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:09.030]  Senator.

[00:32:57.959 --> 00:33:03.662]  The Bilderberg Group is meeting right now in Italy.
[00:33:03.742 --> 00:33:08.825]  I would add, while Lord Bush is there.
[00:33:25.117 --> 00:33:25.617]  We're good to go.
[00:33:56.385 --> 00:34:00.168]  We'll get into the Bilderberg Group, get into the story I just mentioned here, U.S.
[00:34:00.188 --> 00:34:11.518]  told Saudis to let al-Qaeda come and escape, and Patriot Act search, buying a home, prepare to pay to have your name checked against a government list of suspected terrorists.
[00:34:13.138 --> 00:34:14.539]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:34:14.559 --> 00:34:16.160]  Just a jam-packed broadcast.
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:18.922]  We're about to go to Ann and Ed and Mike and many others that are holding.
[00:34:19.322 --> 00:34:21.043]  The total free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[00:34:21.063 --> 00:34:23.564]  You know, you can watch Michael Moore's new trailer for Fahrenheit 9-11.
[00:34:30.259 --> 00:34:33.602]  The New York Post said it was a rip-off of my film, but I don't totally agree with that.
[00:34:34.142 --> 00:34:36.644]  The point is, you can go watch it at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:34:36.764 --> 00:34:37.585]  I'm impressed with it.
[00:34:38.125 --> 00:34:45.511]  Though I've talked to those that have seen the film, as I mentioned yesterday, and I've read a bunch of reviews, his answer is, America's evil, we need to have the UN take over.
[00:34:45.811 --> 00:34:51.776]  And that's why I said two years ago that 9-11's going to come out, but it's going to be blamed on a cabal in America.
[00:34:52.276 --> 00:34:57.260]  We're going to be the bad cop, whereas in truth, we're a hand puppet for Europe, and that's just the facts.
[00:34:58.934 --> 00:35:02.175]  We have to go over and take over Iraq, then the UN comes in as the savior.
[00:35:02.455 --> 00:35:12.078]  So it's all meant to come out, and now we're learning why Mr. Tenet resigned, and very, very serious information on that front as well.
[00:35:13.098 --> 00:35:15.579]  I aired this a couple times yesterday, and I just can't help it.
[00:35:15.619 --> 00:35:17.039]  I want to air this trailer again.
[00:35:17.059 --> 00:35:20.560]  This is, I mean, just listen to this.
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:26.302]  I mean, he only covers about 2 or 3 percent, I'm told, of the real issues, but still, it's quite damning.
[00:35:26.342 --> 00:35:26.762]  Here it is.
[00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:29.851]  You can make people do anything if they're afraid.
[00:35:30.691 --> 00:35:38.774]  The FAA had taken the action to close all of the airports in the United States.
[00:35:38.894 --> 00:35:41.155]  All commercial and airline traffic was grounded.
[00:35:41.195 --> 00:35:48.658]  But we had some airplanes authorized at the highest levels of our government to pick up Osama bin Laden's family members and transport them out of this country.
[00:35:48.758 --> 00:35:55.041]  In the middle of the war, corporations decided to hold a conference to figure out how much money could be made.
[00:35:56.395 --> 00:35:58.796]  Once that oil stops flowing, it's going to be lots of money.
[00:35:59.036 --> 00:36:00.597]  Whatever it costs, the government will pay you.
[00:36:00.817 --> 00:36:04.279]  It's going to be good for business, bad for the people.
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:11.783]  Congressman, trying to get members of Congress to get their kids to enlist in the Army and go over to Iraq.
[00:36:14.252 --> 00:36:18.374]  The USA Patriot Act allows for searches of medical and financial records.
[00:36:18.834 --> 00:36:21.035]  It gives law enforcement almost unlimited power.
[00:36:21.475 --> 00:36:22.816]  They wait till the middle of the night.
[00:36:22.936 --> 00:36:24.577]  It's printed in the middle of the night.
[00:36:24.657 --> 00:36:28.378]  How could Congress pass the Patriot Act without even reading it?
[00:36:28.898 --> 00:36:29.859]  Sit down, my son.
[00:36:31.387 --> 00:36:34.148]  We don't read most of the bills.
[00:36:34.488 --> 00:36:35.669]  No one read it.
[00:36:35.709 --> 00:36:39.410]  Members of Congress, this is Michael Moore.
[00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:46.832]  I would like to read to you the USA Patriot Act.
[00:36:46.872 --> 00:36:48.773]  Let the eagle soar.
[00:36:48.813 --> 00:36:51.314]  From the corridors of power.
[00:36:51.354 --> 00:36:54.755]  To the streets of small-town America.
[00:36:54.975 --> 00:36:56.736]  To the front lines.
[00:36:58.536 --> 00:36:59.837]  Impressive crowd, the haves.
[00:37:01.033 --> 00:37:01.693]  And to have more.
[00:37:02.274 --> 00:37:05.075]  Some people call you the elite.
[00:37:05.236 --> 00:37:06.016]  I call you my base.
[00:37:06.556 --> 00:37:12.600]  Comes the true story that will make your temperature rise.
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.902]  Now watch this drive!
[00:37:16.142 --> 00:37:22.946]  All nations can do everything they can to stop these terrorist killers.
[00:37:24.787 --> 00:37:26.528]  Thank you.
[00:37:26.548 --> 00:37:27.449]  Now watch this drive.
[00:37:33.135 --> 00:37:35.896]  I call on all nations to stand up against the terrorists.
[00:37:35.916 --> 00:37:36.856]  Now watch this drive.
[00:37:37.856 --> 00:37:45.457]  Now again, then what they do is the neocons, who are more big government socialists than anybody, come out and go, Michael Moore's a socialist.
[00:37:45.878 --> 00:37:49.158]  He says, see, if you talk about 9-11, you're with those evil liberals.
[00:37:49.698 --> 00:37:51.379]  That's how the paradigm management works.
[00:37:51.399 --> 00:37:53.419]  And then, oh, the Democrats are going to save us in the film.
[00:37:53.439 --> 00:37:55.159]  That's what I've been told.
[00:37:55.219 --> 00:37:55.620]  I haven't seen it.
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.860]  I've talked to several friends in New York who have in screenings.
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.801]  So, this is what's going on.
[00:38:01.702 --> 00:38:03.263]  Bill Clinton protected Al-Qaeda.
[00:38:03.283 --> 00:38:05.164]  Bill Clinton helped bomb Oklahoma City.
[00:38:05.684 --> 00:38:08.806]  The FBI cooked the bomb and trained the drivers in the first World Trade Center.
[00:38:09.486 --> 00:38:11.787]  And that's what we do in 9-11, the road to tyranny.
[00:38:11.827 --> 00:38:14.749]  We expose Bill Clinton as the puppet, the terrorist puppet.
[00:38:15.049 --> 00:38:17.130]  We expose George Bush as the terrorist puppet.
[00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:21.293]  We expose the system behind these puppets and give you the big picture.
[00:38:21.733 --> 00:38:26.856]  And that's the difference between 9-11, the road to tyranny, and part two of that, the masters of terror,
[00:38:28.124 --> 00:38:30.846]  Is that we go into all the details.
[00:38:31.626 --> 00:38:37.750]  So when your friends and family in the next few weeks go see Fahrenheit 9-11, be there ready with a copy of my films.
[00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:38.851]  You're authorized to make copies.
[00:38:39.171 --> 00:38:39.611]  That's right.
[00:38:39.651 --> 00:38:41.452]  As the New York Post even admitted, I'm not in this for money.
[00:38:41.973 --> 00:38:43.474]  I want you to make copies of my videos.
[00:38:43.614 --> 00:38:50.058]  I want to warn people or the globalists are going to blow more stuff up, set up a total police state, and my family's not going to have a future.
[00:38:50.078 --> 00:38:51.218]  That's why I'm saying make copies.
[00:38:51.799 --> 00:38:55.181]  And I hope you figure that out because your family's not going to have a future either, boys and girls.
[00:38:55.871 --> 00:38:57.912]  Okay, I mean, they're openly saying martial law.
[00:38:58.172 --> 00:38:59.573]  Top generals are openly saying it.
[00:38:59.713 --> 00:39:01.354]  They're openly built all these camps.
[00:39:01.854 --> 00:39:03.275]  I mean, this is really happening.
[00:39:03.595 --> 00:39:08.197]  Yes, you're really in the beginnings of a Soviet-slash-Nazi state.
[00:39:09.678 --> 00:39:11.018]  But we can stop this.
[00:39:11.138 --> 00:39:18.782]  If you'll go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com and order via our secure, safe shopping cart,
[00:39:20.197 --> 00:39:24.439]  Or if you will simply call toll-free and tell them you want the 9-11 videos, both of them.
[00:39:24.459 --> 00:39:25.739]  You want my book on 9-11.
[00:39:25.959 --> 00:39:28.821]  You want Paul Watson's great book on 9-11, Order Out of Chaos.
[00:39:29.181 --> 00:39:32.782]  You want Eric Huffman's video on 9-11 that we carry in VHS and DVD.
[00:39:33.262 --> 00:39:37.604]  You want these films, and you want to get them out to people, and you want to expose this.
[00:39:38.004 --> 00:39:39.845]  So go to InfoWars.com.
[00:39:40.205 --> 00:39:41.286]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:39:42.632 --> 00:39:45.154]  Order the videos now, folks.
[00:39:45.174 --> 00:39:50.897]  1-888-253-3139 Again, that's 888-253-3139 Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704
[00:40:10.879 --> 00:40:11.479]  Don't wait.
[00:40:11.619 --> 00:40:12.660]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:13.820]  Get the films.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.060]  Put them on AXS TV.
[00:40:15.421 --> 00:40:16.621]  Get them to your universities.
[00:40:16.681 --> 00:40:18.021]  Get them to your police officers.
[00:40:18.522 --> 00:40:20.902]  All the opinion makers out there.
[00:40:21.263 --> 00:40:24.184]  This is so important.
[00:40:24.204 --> 00:40:29.025]  888-253-3139 The videos are $25.95 all over two hours apiece.
[00:40:30.106 --> 00:40:31.126]  $20 when you order three or more.
[00:40:31.646 --> 00:40:35.527]  Let's go to calls and I'll get into all the Bilderberg Group news and the terror news and the rest of it.
[00:40:36.248 --> 00:40:37.268]  Ann in New Mexico.
[00:40:37.308 --> 00:40:38.508]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:40:38.929 --> 00:40:39.789]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:40:40.109 --> 00:40:40.609]  How are you doing?
[00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:41.790]  Good, and you?
[00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:43.271]  Fine.
[00:40:43.411 --> 00:40:48.935]  You're a warrior, and I depend on you for accurate documentation.
[00:40:49.696 --> 00:40:51.857]  And, by the way, Yahweh bless you.
[00:40:51.877 --> 00:40:52.258]  Thank you.
[00:40:52.818 --> 00:40:55.520]  And the listeners, please repent and turn to Yahshua.
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:41:09.130]  This is what I've been hearing on the shortwave, two different programs concerning... This may be a hoax, I don't know, but concerning something coming toward Earth, and the debris should hit...
[00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:12.792]  We're good to go.
[00:41:34.405 --> 00:41:36.046]  You know, I'm not advertising here.
[00:41:36.066 --> 00:41:37.668]  Could I give the website?
[00:41:37.808 --> 00:41:39.089]  Well, ma'am, I'm aware of all this.
[00:41:39.129 --> 00:41:39.709]  Oh, you are?
[00:41:39.809 --> 00:41:40.870]  Okay.
[00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:42.491]  This is why I called to ask you.
[00:41:42.511 --> 00:41:45.633]  Let me just try to give you some background on this.
[00:41:45.913 --> 00:41:46.294]  Yes, sir.
[00:41:47.374 --> 00:41:52.918]  This is a reoccurring kind of bi-yearly urban legend.
[00:41:53.118 --> 00:41:53.759]  Oh, okay.
[00:41:54.179 --> 00:41:54.779]  All right.
[00:41:54.819 --> 00:41:55.160]  Yeah.
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:58.522]  Thanks, because that's what I wanted to know.
[00:41:59.022 --> 00:41:59.843]  Thank you so much.
[00:42:00.367 --> 00:42:03.530]  Okay, well let me try to give you a two or three minute synopsis of this.
[00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:04.831]  You want to hang on or you want me to let you go?
[00:42:05.612 --> 00:42:07.254]  Well, I'll listen to you, okay?
[00:42:07.334 --> 00:42:09.196]  And thank you so much and Yahweh bless you.
[00:42:09.396 --> 00:42:10.857]  Okay, thank you and God bless you too.
[00:42:11.318 --> 00:42:11.998]  Okay, listen.
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:16.282]  I mean, I could spend three hours on this one point.
[00:42:16.323 --> 00:42:17.544]  That's my great frustration.
[00:42:18.505 --> 00:42:19.225]  I mean, I live this.
[00:42:19.245 --> 00:42:19.906]  This is what I do.
[00:42:20.487 --> 00:42:23.830]  I spend four or five hours a day reading the news wires, reading scientific reports.
[00:42:24.837 --> 00:42:25.518]  Researching.
[00:42:26.258 --> 00:42:38.846]  This broadcast is the most popular, most powerful, populist, patriot, conservative, libertarian, whatever you want to call it, broadcast in the country, alternative broadcast, because I do not speculate.
[00:42:39.406 --> 00:42:45.310]  And I do not give you urban legends, and I do not get into chicken little scenarios that are not founded.
[00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:46.911]  Okay?
[00:42:47.791 --> 00:42:49.072]  I'm glad you brought this up.
[00:42:50.362 --> 00:42:56.124]  About five years ago, I started getting calls, Planet X, the 10th planet, it's going to smash, it's going to kill us any minute.
[00:42:56.964 --> 00:42:57.824]  It's going to be here in 2000.
[00:42:58.444 --> 00:42:59.564]  It's going to be here in 2001.
[00:42:59.765 --> 00:43:00.905]  It's going to be here in 2002.
[00:43:01.645 --> 00:43:06.066]  Oh, the Gregorian calendar was three years off, which I predicted they'd say when it didn't come.
[00:43:06.366 --> 00:43:07.307]  Oh, the calendar was off.
[00:43:07.327 --> 00:43:07.687]  It'll be here in 2004.
[00:43:07.727 --> 00:43:08.127]  Didn't happen.
[00:43:13.602 --> 00:43:14.803]  Something blew up.
[00:43:14.983 --> 00:43:21.948]  Multiple explosions over the Pacific Northwest yesterday morning at, you know, like 2 in the morning.
[00:43:23.929 --> 00:43:33.996]  And then this weird hoax report goes out on a local news station in Seattle where they go, you know, oh, this was a meteorite.
[00:43:34.016 --> 00:43:35.357]  We're going to pick up the debris of it.
[00:43:35.457 --> 00:43:36.598]  Was it really a hoax?
[00:43:37.999 --> 00:43:41.221]  Now, they admit that there were giant explosions in the sky.
[00:43:41.281 --> 00:43:42.362]  That part's not a hoax.
[00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:51.417]  But they insert this supposed hoax in that, oh, the meteor didn't hit the ground or chunks of it didn't and there isn't some secret government group out inspecting it.
[00:43:51.898 --> 00:43:54.240]  I don't know if that's true or not, so I'm not going to talk about it.
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.321]  I mean, I mentioned it, but we don't know.
[00:43:56.662 --> 00:44:02.687]  We know there were giant explosions witnessed by hundreds of thousands, because most people were asleep, heard by tens of millions.
[00:44:02.707 --> 00:44:04.989]  I mean, it was heard in three states.
[00:44:05.489 --> 00:44:08.692]  Multiple giant rolling explosions.
[00:44:09.693 --> 00:44:10.053]  Okay?
[00:44:11.515 --> 00:44:12.816]  And we've seen this before.
[00:44:13.156 --> 00:44:15.517]  I have seen this when I was about 13 out camping.
[00:44:15.537 --> 00:44:18.438]  I heard this noise.
[00:44:18.619 --> 00:44:18.999]  Look up.
[00:44:19.019 --> 00:44:23.521]  There's this giant white fireball that then explodes.
[00:44:23.641 --> 00:44:26.262]  And my father goes, that's a stone meteorite.
[00:44:27.503 --> 00:44:29.564]  That's what stone meteorites do.
[00:44:29.584 --> 00:44:30.224]  They come in.
[00:44:30.264 --> 00:44:36.247]  They're the size of a locomotive of hard stone and iron.
[00:44:36.969 --> 00:44:43.216]  They heat up, the gases expand, they explode, thank God, or they would devastate a large area.
[00:44:44.377 --> 00:44:45.939]  Devastate a large area.
[00:44:46.639 --> 00:44:52.065]  We're talking, you know, killing half the people in Dallas, Texas if one the size of a freight train hits.
[00:44:52.766 --> 00:44:55.289]  You know, coming in at a couple hundred thousand miles per hour.
[00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:56.630]  All right?
[00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:01.231]  Long before, we had all these technologies.
[00:45:01.551 --> 00:45:02.951]  It could be some type of government technology.
[00:45:02.971 --> 00:45:05.512]  It could be a spacecraft reentering, blowing up.
[00:45:05.532 --> 00:45:07.832]  The government, NASA, even says it could be space debris.
[00:45:07.852 --> 00:45:08.433]  We don't know.
[00:45:08.813 --> 00:45:15.495]  But in 1918, over Siberia, one blew up with the equivalent power of a good-sized nuclear bomb.
[00:45:15.835 --> 00:45:18.775]  But luckily, there was no one in that area.
[00:45:19.016 --> 00:45:21.196]  But for decades, there were all these flattened trees.
[00:45:21.236 --> 00:45:23.537]  I'm sure you've seen it on television, the film of that.
[00:45:25.948 --> 00:45:27.328]  So again, we don't know.
[00:45:27.668 --> 00:45:49.654]  But what happens is, every time a meteor comes in or some space junk comes in, these people re-emerge, saying that this planet's about to hit us, saying it's the end of the world, this planet comes by every 3,600 years, and giant lizard aliens, like a gang of pirates, pull upside our planet and jump off of Planet X and begin gobbling us.
[00:45:51.698 --> 00:45:52.859]  I mean, I'm sorry, people.
[00:45:52.959 --> 00:45:55.000]  I'm just not going to get into it.
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:58.861]  I will read you the Associated Press about three one-million-man camps.
[00:45:59.982 --> 00:46:05.904]  I will get into things that are real, which people have trouble believing.
[00:46:06.145 --> 00:46:09.426]  I will read Army documents where they say they want to put microchips in your brain.
[00:46:09.846 --> 00:46:11.367]  That's hard enough to believe.
[00:46:12.327 --> 00:46:20.850]  But a planet pulling upside us with lizards jumping across, with large fangs seeking our blood, our brains, actually.
[00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:22.591]  They want to eat our brains, according to these people.
[00:46:23.031 --> 00:46:23.952]  I'm not going to go there.
[00:46:24.832 --> 00:46:25.192]  Okay?
[00:46:25.592 --> 00:46:29.534]  And this is a tactic used by some people in the establishment.
[00:46:29.574 --> 00:46:30.574]  I mean, notice, look.
[00:46:31.735 --> 00:46:35.056]  There was a Kansas City Star, New York Times article, Wired News article.
[00:46:35.959 --> 00:46:51.289]  A bunch of them last year were admitted that this Rothschild character, hooked up with Bill Clinton's former chief of staff with the Sci-Fi Channel, is actually involved in some weird government program to put out these reports that this is going to happen.
[00:46:51.729 --> 00:46:53.810]  So we know where this is originating from.
[00:46:54.611 --> 00:46:59.854]  And then a lot of well-meaning people go out and pick up on this and parrot it ad nauseum.
[00:47:01.175 --> 00:47:09.238]  Now, could a giant meteor hit us next week and kill a million people and then black out the sun for two years?
[00:47:09.318 --> 00:47:12.219]  And could the temperature of the earth fall to below zero?
[00:47:12.279 --> 00:47:15.020]  And could five billion people die?
[00:47:15.881 --> 00:47:18.762]  Yes, but isn't it interesting we suddenly hear all these stories.
[00:47:19.122 --> 00:47:20.763]  Meanwhile, this big movie's out.
[00:47:24.044 --> 00:47:29.006]  The day after tomorrow, it is now admitted that it was a government test.
[00:47:29.995 --> 00:47:41.263]  On Halloween, back during the Depression, with Orson Welles and the War of the Worlds, that was actually a psychological warfare test.
[00:47:41.703 --> 00:47:45.686]  I'm here at Bakersfield, the aliens have exited, they're firing, they're firing heat rays!
[00:47:46.087 --> 00:47:46.227]  Ah!
[00:47:46.247 --> 00:47:48.568]  The aliens are attacking us!
[00:47:48.748 --> 00:47:49.789]  Oh my God, it's all over!
[00:47:49.949 --> 00:47:52.291]  I mean, this is... Come on, people!
[00:47:52.731 --> 00:47:54.953]  We've got Iron Mountain, we've got government reports...
[00:47:55.831 --> 00:48:06.340]  Even Scientific American a decade ago admitted that they've got hologram machines that can project Jesus, Buddha, the Pope, whatever they want in the sky.
[00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:09.402]  They used this in 91 against the Iraqis.
[00:48:11.064 --> 00:48:16.989]  So this is part, at least the psychological warfare edge of it, is part of a larger program.
[00:48:17.029 --> 00:48:23.094]  There is an official government program that we've documented to have a fake alien invasion.
[00:48:23.675 --> 00:48:24.857]  We have it from good sources.
[00:48:24.877 --> 00:48:36.495]  They've got giant blimps rigged up to look like spaceships with all sorts of newfangled projectors in them to have spaceships flying in and out of the mothership.
[00:48:36.936 --> 00:48:37.977]  I'll make a movie about that.
[00:48:39.631 --> 00:48:43.775]  I'll give all my ideas away, but the government would not want that produced.
[00:48:44.135 --> 00:48:55.947]  They admit that the government actually encouraged and helped fund some of the production of these movies about these impacts and these asteroids coming to get us and the world coming together to battle it and to deal with it.
[00:48:57.535 --> 00:48:59.356]  There was actually a German program.
[00:48:59.376 --> 00:49:00.576]  Did you know this is declassified?
[00:49:01.037 --> 00:49:03.718]  They had jets that looked like flying saucers.
[00:49:03.818 --> 00:49:04.458]  Did you know this?
[00:49:04.958 --> 00:49:16.764]  And they would have German soldiers in these alien outfits would actually get off and do things to try to... Hitler had a lot of weird programs going, and we just picked up on a lot of that.
[00:49:16.784 --> 00:49:19.205]  That's actually confirmed.
[00:49:19.325 --> 00:49:22.106]  So this is a very old program.
[00:49:23.306 --> 00:49:26.108]  And are there extraterrestrials?
[00:49:26.288 --> 00:49:26.788]  Probably.
[00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:30.011]  You know, there's billions of star systems.
[00:49:32.233 --> 00:49:33.354]  Could they land tomorrow?
[00:49:33.435 --> 00:49:33.815]  Yes.
[00:49:33.875 --> 00:49:35.536]  Could an asteroid kill us all tomorrow?
[00:49:35.657 --> 00:49:36.057]  Yes.
[00:49:36.437 --> 00:49:38.579]  Have asteroids hit us and killed a lot of creatures?
[00:49:38.659 --> 00:49:39.080]  Yes.
[00:49:40.281 --> 00:49:44.625]  But, I mean, that's about it, folks.
[00:49:45.766 --> 00:49:48.869]  So, I didn't want to spend all day on this.
[00:49:50.897 --> 00:50:02.588]  But, again, they keep recycling this story that that's why the aircraft fleets, aircraft carriers are being launched, seven of the twelve right now, and that's why, you know, there's all this security and martial law stuff.
[00:50:02.628 --> 00:50:07.432]  It's really because it's about to be the day after tomorrow, right when the movie comes out.
[00:50:07.473 --> 00:50:08.594]  I mean, just come on.
[00:50:09.314 --> 00:50:09.955]  Come on.
[00:50:10.295 --> 00:50:11.276]  Ed in Pennsylvania.
[00:50:11.296 --> 00:50:11.917]  Go ahead, Ed.
[00:50:11.937 --> 00:50:14.859]  I mean, Ed's gone.
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:15.940]  Mike in Texas.
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:16.521]  Go ahead, Mike.
[00:50:21.303 --> 00:50:21.583]  Sorry.
[00:50:22.284 --> 00:50:24.846]  Yeah, I'd like to make a point about RFID chips.
[00:50:25.287 --> 00:50:25.607]  Yes!
[00:50:26.148 --> 00:50:29.871]  Okay.
[00:50:30.231 --> 00:50:35.997]  What I've had success with lately is people... I hear your music.
[00:50:36.037 --> 00:50:36.797]  Can I hold a moment?
[00:50:36.917 --> 00:50:37.358]  Yes, you can.
[00:50:37.398 --> 00:50:37.918]  Please continue.
[00:50:38.359 --> 00:50:38.639]  Okay.
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:42.983]  I've heard it's real hard to get through to people about the RFID chips.
[00:50:43.944 --> 00:50:47.187]  I equate them with the tattoo on the forearms.
[00:50:47.639 --> 00:50:50.060]  And that's a symbol that everyone seems to.
[00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:52.281]  Tell you what, Mike, stay there.
[00:50:52.301 --> 00:50:53.601]  I'll let you finish up on the other side.
[00:50:53.881 --> 00:50:57.623]  We're talking about radio frequency identification devices.
[00:50:57.903 --> 00:50:58.723]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.624 --> 00:51:05.966]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.146 --> 00:51:10.508]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:13.682 --> 00:51:22.492]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.552 --> 00:51:29.480]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.621 --> 00:51:31.623]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.863 --> 00:51:42.325]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.605 --> 00:51:47.966]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[00:52:23.563 --> 00:52:24.443]  We're good to go.

[00:54:10.852 --> 00:54:19.455]  Perhaps I should give a more cogent, focused, detailed analysis of the New Age UFO religion, how it's government-sponsored.
[00:54:21.476 --> 00:54:22.217]  How H.G.
[00:54:22.257 --> 00:54:23.917]  Wells worked with Orson Welles.
[00:54:23.977 --> 00:54:29.340]  I even have the old radio recordings of them talking on one of the San Antonio stations about it.
[00:54:30.487 --> 00:54:33.269]  And how this was all basically a psychological warfare program.
[00:54:33.309 --> 00:54:41.673]  We see the same stuff being carried out today as a way to cover up secret government programs of advanced technologies, as a way to scare the public into submission.
[00:54:42.534 --> 00:54:44.235]  Perhaps I should talk about that in the next hour.
[00:54:44.335 --> 00:54:47.737]  But the toll-free number to join us, we're going to take a lot of calls in the next hour.
[00:54:47.797 --> 00:54:48.657]  Go to your calls quickly.
[00:54:48.677 --> 00:54:49.378]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:49.558 --> 00:54:53.560]  Got a bunch of details.
[00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:56.842]  The Bilderberg Group that's meeting right now, a bunch of mainstream news articles on that.
[00:54:57.717 --> 00:55:02.898]  The real rulers of the globe and a BBC article that attacks anybody that discusses them.
[00:55:03.398 --> 00:55:07.339]  We'll also get into the latest developments in Iraq and the Patriot Act as well.
[00:55:07.399 --> 00:55:14.341]  But Mike in Texas, yes, they've announced that all products are already starting to have them put in, but all products will have them put in in the near future.
[00:55:14.781 --> 00:55:16.181]  Small tracker chips.
[00:55:16.241 --> 00:55:21.002]  This will replace the barcode and will track you to your home and then even to the landfill.
[00:55:21.642 --> 00:55:22.222]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:55:22.742 --> 00:55:25.323]  Yes, and I explain that to people.
[00:55:25.925 --> 00:55:32.511]  And I've gotten a lot of glazed looks, but something that does seem to work is to equate this with another society.
[00:55:32.611 --> 00:55:37.396]  I ask them what other society tracked people down to that minute level.
[00:55:37.796 --> 00:55:44.262]  And invariably, the Nazis, the tattoo on the forearm registers.
[00:55:44.763 --> 00:55:47.385]  Old people, young people seem to be aware of the tattoo.
[00:55:48.126 --> 00:55:50.108]  And so that's a way.
[00:55:51.673 --> 00:55:59.758]  To get other folks to think about it, to start doing some of their own thinking about how bad, what a bad road this is to go down.
[00:56:01.158 --> 00:56:08.162]  Well, in 2001, Walmart announced that all their products by 2004 would have it, and they tried to do that because it was Walmart in 1986.
[00:56:08.583 --> 00:56:10.143]  People wouldn't accept the barcode.
[00:56:10.924 --> 00:56:17.608]  And then Walmart said all suppliers must have this, and that finally made all the suppliers go to it, and so that then became the norm.
[00:56:17.708 --> 00:56:17.928]  Now...
[00:56:18.855 --> 00:56:21.896]  They're about a year behind, but they say by next year everything will have it.
[00:56:21.936 --> 00:56:28.938]  Thousands of products already have it, from Gillette razors to cans of soup, a little tiny chip smaller than a grain of sand.
[00:56:29.618 --> 00:56:36.360]  And then they'll also scan your name onto it when you leave and use that as part of a tracking system, and this is all admitted.
[00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:46.663]  And then now they're even coming out at some Safeways and Kroger's around the country with smart carts where it has the RFID, and you just throw it in your basket, walk out,
[00:56:47.421 --> 00:56:51.385]  And it face scans you because the driver's license facility already got the digital photo.
[00:56:51.785 --> 00:56:56.169]  It matches it to that, and then you leave, and then, oh, you get the discount.
[00:56:56.189 --> 00:57:02.755]  Your products are about 20% cheaper if you enroll in this, and then see after they've got us all conditioned, then everybody will have to do it.
[00:57:04.238 --> 00:57:09.463]  Right, and a lot of people don't seem to be aware of the logical outcome of that.
[00:57:10.023 --> 00:57:13.046]  Once all of that is in place... What do I have to hide?
[00:57:13.146 --> 00:57:16.349]  So what if I'm being scanned and everything I buy being tracked?
[00:57:16.389 --> 00:57:26.578]  Well, then if you're not a good globalist, they simply turn off your face scan and say you're a bad person under the CAPS-2 system and the nice armored vehicle pulls up to pick you up as you leave the grocery store.
[00:57:27.379 --> 00:57:30.442]  Right, exactly, and instead of a tattoo on the arm...
[00:57:31.132 --> 00:57:32.172]  It's all on the computer.
[00:57:32.713 --> 00:57:35.394]  It's all according to your face, your thumbprint, your voice, yes.
[00:57:35.814 --> 00:57:35.974]  Yeah.
[00:57:36.534 --> 00:57:48.698]  And one other thing, the woman who called about the explosions, you know, Werner Von Braun said we were going to fight communism, terrorism, then asteroids, then space aliens.
[00:57:49.459 --> 00:57:51.940]  And that's because that was a German plan.
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:52.960]  Right.
[00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:54.381]  A way to mobilize the people.
[00:57:54.961 --> 00:57:56.621]  And, folks, this is mainstream history.
[00:57:56.641 --> 00:57:57.902]  This is History Channel stuff.
[00:57:57.942 --> 00:57:58.242]  It's not...
[00:57:59.293 --> 00:58:00.754]  And again, it's not real aliens.
[00:58:00.854 --> 00:58:01.975]  It's the threat of them.
[00:58:02.875 --> 00:58:03.075]  Right.
[00:58:03.135 --> 00:58:12.901]  They created communism, created this current terrorist threat, so what's to stop them from creating light shows, asteroids, space aliens?
[00:58:12.921 --> 00:58:14.462]  Well, that's the admitted program.
[00:58:14.802 --> 00:58:14.982]  Yeah.
[00:58:15.683 --> 00:58:18.444]  And they've got the so-called patriot movement out there promoting it for them.
[00:58:18.485 --> 00:58:19.725]  Sure sells a lot of books, though.
[00:58:20.165 --> 00:58:20.346]  Yeah.
[00:58:20.746 --> 00:58:24.208]  And it all seems to be on track according to what he said near the end of his life, so...
[00:58:24.761 --> 00:58:25.381]  That's all I had.
[00:58:25.441 --> 00:58:25.942]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:58:25.982 --> 00:58:26.382]  Thank you.
[00:58:26.422 --> 00:58:30.964]  And again, Wernher von Braun was the head of Nazi technology development, the rocketry expert.
[00:58:31.845 --> 00:58:36.327]  He was then the head of NASA with Mr. Gotthard.
[00:58:37.828 --> 00:58:41.730]  And yeah, it's true, the Nazis had these jets that looked like flying saucers.
[00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:45.312]  They only had a few of them, and they were doing tests, guys getting out in rubber suits.
[00:58:45.812 --> 00:58:47.793]  You know, I'm an alien, serve the Nazis.
[00:58:47.893 --> 00:58:49.714]  It seemed to work quite well on Russian peasants.
[00:58:52.046 --> 00:58:55.308]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:58:55.368 --> 00:58:59.551]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:58:59.812 --> 00:59:02.594]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:59:02.794 --> 00:59:05.195]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:59:05.376 --> 00:59:14.022]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:59:14.222 --> 00:59:15.563]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:59:15.763 --> 00:59:19.906]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:59:20.166 --> 00:59:20.687]  We're good to go.
[00:59:39.206 --> 00:59:39.426]  Big Brother.
[00:59:39.446 --> 00:59:40.227]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:40.247 --> 00:59:40.928]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:40.948 --> 00:59:41.428]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.694 --> 01:00:05.595]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:06.255 --> 01:00:09.957]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.437 --> 01:00:14.559]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:23.903]  All right, my friends, it's Friday, the fourth day of June 2004.
[01:00:23.983 --> 01:00:25.004]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:00:25.144 --> 01:00:26.564]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:00:26.584 --> 01:00:27.565]  We've got two hours left.
[01:00:29.475 --> 01:00:34.877]  And we're going to get into the Bilderberg Group meeting, the global ruler meeting that's going on right now in Italy.
[01:00:34.897 --> 01:00:37.518]  Got a bunch of big developments there.
[01:00:38.579 --> 01:00:40.860]  Also, this headline I mentioned in the first hour, U.S.
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:43.281]  told Saudis to let al-Qaeda government escape.
[01:00:44.521 --> 01:00:52.365]  Also, the Patriot search, buying a home, prepare to pay to have your name checked against a government list of suspected terrorists or for other crimes.
[01:00:52.385 --> 01:00:53.125]  That's Newsweek.
[01:00:53.914 --> 01:00:58.120]  Newsweek earlier this week came out with The Future of Shopping and Plantable Chips Under Your Skin.
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:58.821]  It's no big deal.
[01:00:58.861 --> 01:00:59.401]  Just accept it.
[01:01:00.102 --> 01:01:02.345]  Bill Clinton says Bush is just doing what he said he'd do.
[01:01:02.405 --> 01:01:03.146]  He likes Bush.
[01:01:04.048 --> 01:01:04.528]  Loves Bush.
[01:01:04.548 --> 01:01:05.790]  He says the war's good.
[01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:07.212]  Bill Clinton...
[01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:13.191]  We will also get into Turkish State Minister leaves for Italy for Bilderberg Group meeting.
[01:01:13.231 --> 01:01:15.572]  That is out of the major Turkish newspaper.
[01:01:16.032 --> 01:01:18.994]  Members of Dutch Labour Party at 52nd Bilderberg Conference.
[01:01:19.014 --> 01:01:21.295]  This is out of the Netherlands Telegraph, their biggest newspaper.
[01:01:21.835 --> 01:01:24.656]  Bilderberg 2004 full participant list.
[01:01:25.096 --> 01:01:28.498]  ABC, if you think Bilderberg has power, you're with McVeigh and Bin Laden.
[01:01:29.598 --> 01:01:31.159]  And much, much more.
[01:01:32.529 --> 01:01:35.410]  But right now, let's get through all these callers that have been patiently holding.
[01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:37.771]  Let's talk to BJ in Missouri.
[01:01:37.811 --> 01:01:38.151]  Go ahead.
[01:01:38.191 --> 01:01:38.811]  You're on the air.
[01:01:38.831 --> 01:01:39.932]  Hi.
[01:01:40.312 --> 01:01:47.114]  I'm a long-time patriot and listener of talk radio, including yours, and I also watch the 700 Club with Pat Robertson.
[01:01:47.534 --> 01:01:54.396]  And I would like to make a correction on something you mentioned the other day about him saying that, you know, the microchip tracking system is good.
[01:01:54.997 --> 01:01:59.518]  I watch him nearly every day, and he has repeatedly talked against that.
[01:01:59.578 --> 01:02:00.458]  I mean, he's against it.
[01:02:00.859 --> 01:02:01.939]  Okay, let me stop you.
[01:02:02.643 --> 01:02:08.864]  I have listeners that send me videos, and I pop them in, and I've probably seen him say three or four times that the microchip is bad.
[01:02:09.004 --> 01:02:10.084]  Then I have him on tape.
[01:02:10.485 --> 01:02:11.205]  I have this on tape.
[01:02:11.625 --> 01:02:12.105]  Yeah.
[01:02:12.205 --> 01:02:14.325]  Saying, oh, it's not the Mark of the Beast, it's not bad.
[01:02:14.345 --> 01:02:21.567]  And then yesterday we played him saying that, you know, these enemy combatants, no Fifth Amendment, well, that's really a good thing.
[01:02:22.127 --> 01:02:22.987]  Did you not hear that?
[01:02:24.207 --> 01:02:25.727]  I've never heard him say that.
[01:02:25.887 --> 01:02:28.848]  I mean, I do know a lot of people take...
[01:02:29.844 --> 01:02:31.064]  They might not get the whole thing.
[01:02:31.084 --> 01:02:32.945]  They'd take maybe one thing he says out of context.
[01:02:33.005 --> 01:02:38.946]  Ma'am, did you hear him three years ago say that China's doing what it has to do with the forced abortion and infanticide?
[01:02:39.766 --> 01:02:40.447]  No, no.
[01:02:40.527 --> 01:02:42.247]  He is against abortion.
[01:02:42.387 --> 01:02:43.607]  He's totally against abortion.
[01:02:43.827 --> 01:02:46.848]  Ma'am, ma'am, look, he said it on CNN, his face.
[01:02:47.208 --> 01:02:52.909]  And then his CBN clarification was, well, China's got all these people.
[01:02:52.949 --> 01:02:55.030]  They've got to have more aggressive Planned Parenthood.
[01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:57.621]  Well, I don't know what the deal was.
[01:02:57.641 --> 01:03:01.044]  I don't know what the deal was, but I've heard him.
[01:03:01.064 --> 01:03:02.465]  I've listened to him for many years.
[01:03:03.224 --> 01:03:07.046]  Okay, well, ma'am, have you heard Jay Sekulow saying the Patriot Act's good?
[01:03:07.447 --> 01:03:08.587]  No, I have not heard him say that.
[01:03:08.847 --> 01:03:10.508]  Okay, well, believe me, I have.
[01:03:10.649 --> 01:03:20.374]  But I do know that he does stand up for a lot of, you know, patriots and, you know, as far as, like, keeping the Ten Commandments, you know, in our public places, you know.
[01:03:20.434 --> 01:03:22.696]  I mean, he does help a lot of people with that.
[01:03:22.716 --> 01:03:23.676]  I do know that.
[01:03:23.956 --> 01:03:30.160]  Look, I try to get... And, like, even with you, some things you say can be... I've heard people say that, you know, taken out of context.
[01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:31.581]  And, you know, that could have happened.
[01:03:32.202 --> 01:03:33.083]  It really could have.
[01:03:33.103 --> 01:03:36.467]  The reason I started watching Pat Robertson was for my own information.
[01:03:36.927 --> 01:03:39.750]  You know, because I heard people say different things about him.
[01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:40.811]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:03:40.871 --> 01:03:43.774]  You didn't hear about the big controversy three years ago with abortion?
[01:03:45.056 --> 01:03:45.356]  No.
[01:03:45.596 --> 01:03:47.638]  I mean, he's always talked against abortion.
[01:03:48.599 --> 01:03:50.722]  From what I've seen.
[01:03:50.762 --> 01:03:53.685]  He said on CNN that China was doing what it had to do.
[01:03:54.915 --> 01:03:55.835]  Well, I don't know.
[01:03:55.875 --> 01:03:58.656]  He could have possibly meant, you know, something else.
[01:03:58.716 --> 01:04:01.276]  No, he was talking about what they were doing in that country.
[01:04:01.716 --> 01:04:02.297]  Specifically.
[01:04:02.317 --> 01:04:04.337]  I can even try to pull up the old article.
[01:04:06.357 --> 01:04:07.798]  Well, I don't know.
[01:04:08.258 --> 01:04:12.519]  Okay, you didn't hear him... Well, you obviously heard yesterday, because you're calling about it.
[01:04:12.539 --> 01:04:22.781]  You didn't hear us play the clip where he was talking about, well, you know, the Fifth Amendment's fine, but these people are terrorists, and they don't deserve the same rights, and this stuff's good, and...
[01:04:24.329 --> 01:04:27.571]  Well, like I said, it might not have been the whole thing.
[01:04:27.591 --> 01:04:32.293]  Because I do know people, they'll pull out part of what he says, but not the rest of it.
[01:04:32.613 --> 01:04:33.874]  And it can make him look bad.
[01:04:34.274 --> 01:04:40.858]  Like there's this late TV show called Jimmy Kimmel, and he does that with Pat Robertson all the time.
[01:04:40.878 --> 01:04:44.319]  He'll have something on there, which makes Pat Robertson just look like an idiot.
[01:04:44.539 --> 01:04:47.161]  And I'm not necessarily standing up for Pat Robertson.
[01:04:47.201 --> 01:04:48.141]  I don't know the man.
[01:04:48.201 --> 01:04:49.702]  Okay, ma'am, I hear you.
[01:04:49.722 --> 01:04:50.383]  I appreciate the call.
[01:04:50.423 --> 01:04:51.163]  More calls coming up.
[01:04:54.631 --> 01:05:02.013]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:05:02.294 --> 01:05:07.015]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:05:07.255 --> 01:05:12.897]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:05:13.157 --> 01:05:17.678]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:05:17.898 --> 01:05:25.040]  The cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:29.601]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.761 --> 01:05:32.281]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:05:32.501 --> 01:05:39.203]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:05:39.443 --> 01:05:40.465]  Or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:05:40.485 --> 01:05:40.705]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:05:54.187 --> 01:05:57.209]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:05:57.549 --> 01:06:06.355]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:06:06.676 --> 01:06:11.359]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:06:11.821 --> 01:06:18.566]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:06:18.947 --> 01:06:30.736]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:06:31.216 --> 01:06:35.659]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:06:35.839 --> 01:06:38.301]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:06:38.321 --> 01:06:40.142]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:41.362]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:06:41.443 --> 01:06:42.903]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:06:42.923 --> 01:06:43.964]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:06:53.536 --> 01:06:57.097]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[01:06:57.417 --> 01:06:57.757]  Yes.
[01:06:58.037 --> 01:07:02.838]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood, the richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[01:07:02.958 --> 01:07:11.879]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, two ounces of juice have the same nutrition as three pounds of choice garden produce.
[01:07:12.039 --> 01:07:19.761]  The get-up-and-go energy, healing, blood-building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.
[01:07:19.961 --> 01:07:22.181]  Hi, I'm Alan Davison at Monocot Wheatgrass.
[01:07:22.381 --> 01:07:25.023]  Thank you for your support of our labors and of this network.
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:08:00.204]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:03.326 --> 01:08:11.832]  Waging war on corruption, crashing with the lies and disinformation, Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[01:08:11.852 --> 01:08:12.672]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:08:13.673 --> 01:08:17.275]  Let's get through some more of these calls, then we'll get into the Bilderberg Group developments.
[01:08:17.436 --> 01:08:20.938]  Very interesting, as well as the Patriot Act, what they're doing with that.
[01:08:22.490 --> 01:08:23.190]  Let's go ahead.
[01:08:23.611 --> 01:08:34.295]  Before I go to George in Texas and Joe and Dylan and Danny and others, the last caller, a lady from Missouri, BJ, she was saying, you know, I haven't heard Pat Robertson say all this stuff.
[01:08:34.315 --> 01:08:36.256]  Well, I have it on videotape, okay?
[01:08:37.816 --> 01:08:41.058]  And he says a lot of things that are true, a lot of things that are great.
[01:08:41.498 --> 01:08:49.641]  And then they mix into all this, well, George Bush is our savior and he's going to keep us safe from all this stuff and these secret arrests are good and
[01:08:50.482 --> 01:08:52.344]  That's basically the line that we're getting.
[01:08:52.464 --> 01:08:54.045]  And I'm sorry, it's on the record.
[01:08:55.586 --> 01:09:05.695]  And he's not a tenth as bad as some of these so-called neocon preachers that are up there promoting this whole police state.
[01:09:06.195 --> 01:09:12.821]  But they won't talk for a minute that FEMA is out there quietly training the police that Christians, gun owners, conservatives are terrorists.
[01:09:12.861 --> 01:09:14.222]  But I have FEMA on video.
[01:09:15.423 --> 01:09:16.644]  I have their own documents.
[01:09:16.784 --> 01:09:18.045]  I have their own training manuals.
[01:09:18.105 --> 01:09:19.206]  It's all in the Road to Tyranny.
[01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:21.011]  Very scary stuff.
[01:09:21.792 --> 01:09:23.673]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in Texas.
[01:09:23.713 --> 01:09:24.414]  George, go ahead.
[01:09:24.434 --> 01:09:25.614]  Hello, Alex.
[01:09:25.875 --> 01:09:26.195]  Yes, sir.
[01:09:27.676 --> 01:09:36.042]  Have you read in the annual guide for hunting and fishing the requirements of the collection of the Social Security number?
[01:09:37.464 --> 01:09:44.629]  On page 29 of this year's book, it says, Social Security number is required by law.
[01:09:44.889 --> 01:09:49.693]  The collection of the Social Security number is mandated by the federal government.
[01:09:50.359 --> 01:09:58.783]  Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has no option but to comply with federal law and collect the numbers from the purchasers of licenses.
[01:09:59.464 --> 01:10:12.610]  And, of course, the federal government's own 1986 Privacy Act says it's illegal for any federal or state agency or anyone else to use a Social Security number as an identifying number.
[01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:19.974]  But, yes, for the last, what, six, seven years, when you go buy a hunting license or fishing license, they scan your ID card
[01:10:20.712 --> 01:10:21.272]  Okay.
[01:10:21.353 --> 01:10:21.893]  Let me finish.
[01:10:22.513 --> 01:10:35.221]  And if you have any warrants, if you haven't paid child support, you name it, you're not allowed to have a card, and just for trying to get one, you were supposed to know that was illegal, so that's a criminal charge, and that's the point.
[01:10:35.362 --> 01:10:46.569]  Databases to do anything, to buy anything, to buy a house, to buy a car, and this is all part of, it's really a gun registration program, and yes, sir, I am aware of that.
[01:10:47.109 --> 01:10:48.410]  Okay, let me read this last sentence.
[01:10:49.110 --> 01:11:00.943]  Your social security number is required to be collected for the purpose of child support collection enforcement under federal statute 42 United States Code section 666.
[01:11:03.905 --> 01:11:04.886]  And this is on page 29.
[01:11:05.166 --> 01:11:06.048]  No, I know.
[01:11:06.088 --> 01:11:07.790]  The subsection in there to do that is 666.
[01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:09.151]  It's always a big joke.
[01:11:09.612 --> 01:11:16.439]  The subsection where they'd arrest any protesters for life in Bill 742 in Oregon would amend Chapter 666.
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:20.104]  It's always a little sick joke that they throw in there
[01:11:20.744 --> 01:11:23.045]  And you notice I just mentioned child support and you brought that up.
[01:11:23.086 --> 01:11:24.306]  They always have an excuse.
[01:11:24.766 --> 01:11:31.390]  The federal excuse to put in FEMA takeover boxes in 97 of all radio and TV stations was, quote, to find missing children.
[01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:33.171]  Now they admit it's for everything.
[01:11:33.351 --> 01:11:35.953]  Anti-gun reports, tattletale reports, all that.
[01:11:36.733 --> 01:11:39.215]  Federal newscasts taking over whenever they want.
[01:11:40.415 --> 01:11:41.356]  Same thing with this.
[01:11:41.556 --> 01:11:48.240]  Oh, it's to stop deadbeat dads, but then it's all other crimes as well when you try to get a license.
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:48.560]  Go ahead.
[01:11:49.122 --> 01:11:52.323]  And since this is a federal law, this applies in all the states.
[01:11:52.463 --> 01:11:53.343]  It's not just Texas.
[01:11:53.363 --> 01:11:59.484]  Is that the little hunting and fishing manual that they give out free that's got a picture of a white-tailed deer and some quail on the front?
[01:11:59.704 --> 01:12:00.084]  Correct.
[01:12:00.184 --> 01:12:14.767]  Every year, if you go to buy a license on one of your grocery stores, and it's right there on page 29, and if anybody disputes it, they can go to their local store, wherever they would buy a license, and read it for themselves, because I'm sure every state would have that.
[01:12:15.247 --> 01:12:15.767]  One other thing.
[01:12:16.354 --> 01:12:17.834]  I'm a cattle rancher out here.
[01:12:17.855 --> 01:12:18.535]  Let me stop you.
[01:12:18.855 --> 01:12:24.437]  I bought a fishing license in Minnesota two years ago and I was up there visiting the network and I had to do it there too, but go ahead.
[01:12:24.457 --> 01:12:28.158]  The RFID is coming.
[01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:29.238]  The U.S.
[01:12:29.258 --> 01:12:32.799]  Department of Agriculture has posted a requirement.
[01:12:32.979 --> 01:12:37.661]  All livestock from chickens to cows to goats to pigs are going to have to have a tracker chip.
[01:12:37.941 --> 01:12:38.301]  Correct.
[01:12:38.661 --> 01:12:41.322]  And this is this year, later on this year.
[01:12:41.622 --> 01:12:44.623]  And they always try it out on livestock first to see how much...
[01:12:46.594 --> 01:12:50.478]  Every week I see a big newspaper going, this lady found her cat five years later.
[01:12:50.518 --> 01:12:51.559]  It had a chip in it.
[01:12:51.839 --> 01:12:53.421]  Shouldn't children have chips?
[01:12:54.802 --> 01:12:58.926]  Right, and they do it by a fiat of a bureaucracy.
[01:12:59.707 --> 01:13:06.273]  In this case, the RFID for cattle is just in the federal registry, a decree by the USDA.
[01:13:07.225 --> 01:13:21.975]  It's just like Walmart says, all our suppliers have to have implantable chips hidden in the product, and then they're like, what, 35% of all retail sales, so all suppliers have to unify that, not just for Walmart, but for everybody, and then they set the standard.
[01:13:22.996 --> 01:13:29.220]  And by the way, the author of Section 666, Lamar Smith, a congressman... From right here in San Antonio, yeah.
[01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:33.122]  Right, they're having their big convention this weekend down there in San Antonio.
[01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:34.143]  A wicked devil.
[01:13:34.874 --> 01:13:42.660]  I wish a bunch of us would go down there and crash their convention and hand out tapes, because a lot of Republicans are good people.
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:43.861]  They're just being deceived.
[01:13:44.401 --> 01:13:45.622]  Here it is right in their face.
[01:13:46.222 --> 01:13:46.562]  Section 666.
[01:13:48.144 --> 01:13:48.804]  How dare they?
[01:13:49.605 --> 01:13:50.345]  How dare they?
[01:13:50.585 --> 01:13:51.466]  I hear you, my friend.
[01:13:51.506 --> 01:13:55.949]  You say that's page 22 of the Fish and Wildlife pamphlet?
[01:13:55.989 --> 01:13:56.329]  Page 29.
[01:13:57.730 --> 01:14:00.032]  And it'll be there, I guess, in every year.
[01:14:00.532 --> 01:14:01.453]  This was last year's.
[01:14:02.488 --> 01:14:04.069]  So I don't even buy a license anymore.
[01:14:04.269 --> 01:14:04.730]  Heck with it.
[01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:06.891]  I'm not going to participate.
[01:14:08.652 --> 01:14:10.434]  All I need to do is read Revelation.
[01:14:10.874 --> 01:14:12.935]  There's a whole verse on 666.
[01:14:14.196 --> 01:14:17.078]  I hear you, my friend, and they let you know, don't they?
[01:14:17.398 --> 01:14:19.640]  No, but thanks for the call, George.
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:21.481]  Look, it's happening.
[01:14:22.163 --> 01:14:31.426]  And in almost every state, these draconian laws about tracking and tracing or secret arrests, if it's something really horrible, it's almost always 666.
[01:14:32.626 --> 01:14:35.467]  Go to your legislature, your state legislature's website.
[01:14:35.487 --> 01:14:36.547]  Go look at the state code 666.
[01:14:37.067 --> 01:14:39.288]  It's always, it's never something about...
[01:14:39.853 --> 01:14:44.635]  You know, gas pipelines or city streets or some innocuous thing.
[01:14:44.675 --> 01:14:49.758]  It's always some secret arrest or tracking law or gun confiscation law.
[01:14:49.778 --> 01:14:52.799]  I mean, it's always some really scary thing.
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:54.300]  And why is that?
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:54.900]  I don't know.
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.981]  I don't know.
[01:14:57.001 --> 01:14:58.962]  I mean, it's bizarro.
[01:14:59.062 --> 01:15:00.303]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:15:01.201 --> 01:15:02.643]  And, yeah, we just put up with it.
[01:15:02.663 --> 01:15:08.728]  We just show up and get our license one year to go fishing and, oh, slap your card, 6666.
[01:15:09.028 --> 01:15:10.089]  In fact, I had seen that.
[01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:15.214]  It's one of the myriad things I think about and I forget about because there's so much going on.
[01:15:16.195 --> 01:15:18.217]  Joe, Hannah in Colorado, go ahead.
[01:15:18.937 --> 01:15:24.863]  Yes, Alex, thank you for taking my call, and thank you for all the great work you're doing in exposing the evil that surrounds us.
[01:15:25.837 --> 01:15:29.899]  I have a question about the immunizations and the cancer that's being put in them.
[01:15:30.039 --> 01:15:30.279]  Yes.
[01:15:30.659 --> 01:15:32.560]  Where can I get specific information?
[01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:43.784]  I'm a nanny for a six-week-old baby, and she's getting ready to allow them to inject him with all this poison, and I wanted to get her on a site where she can get the information.
[01:15:44.104 --> 01:15:44.325]  Okay.
[01:15:44.485 --> 01:15:49.907]  I have told my webmaster, Paul Watson, at InfoNitem, and he does a great job, I can't complain.
[01:15:50.427 --> 01:15:54.749]  I have requested the boss, my wife, who does InfoWars.com,
[01:15:55.942 --> 01:15:57.443]  To create a vaccine section.
[01:15:57.523 --> 01:16:01.825]  Now, in the older cycles, we redesigned every few years, did have that.
[01:16:01.865 --> 01:16:03.366]  It's buried in a deep archive.
[01:16:03.866 --> 01:16:04.867]  Needs to be updated.
[01:16:05.347 --> 01:16:15.872]  Every week or so, I read some new article where, you know, big newspapers are admitting they found cancer viruses in it or they found hormones to sterilize women in it.
[01:16:17.797 --> 01:16:26.180]  I open up some major newspaper, and it says, oh, strangely enough, the new flu shot has 215 times safe levels of thimerosal.
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.001]  They've actually added more mercury.
[01:16:28.521 --> 01:16:35.484]  So I have all those articles, and then I get them, and we post them on the main page, and then we move on, and then it gets buried.
[01:16:36.104 --> 01:16:38.925]  And yes, that is one of the most... We've got to build that.
[01:16:39.005 --> 01:16:40.046]  Paul, you could do it in an hour.
[01:16:40.606 --> 01:16:42.907]  Just do some web searches on cancer and the vaccines.
[01:16:44.646 --> 01:16:52.571]  On the Thimerosal, that ABC report from a few months ago where the CDC's own documents admit it hundreds of times, safe levels.
[01:16:53.572 --> 01:16:56.494]  All of that, just maybe post 10, 15 articles on that.
[01:16:57.295 --> 01:16:59.096]  We've got to get that done.
[01:17:01.017 --> 01:17:05.961]  I give them so much work to do, and that one keeps falling through the cracks, but I don't have it here in front of me, and I should.
[01:17:07.658 --> 01:17:19.592]  And by the way, we should also add the Dr. Henry Kissinger CIA document that was declassified in 92, written in 73, where they ordered the Third World to sterilize half their women if they wanted IMF World Bank money.
[01:17:20.653 --> 01:17:22.175]  So all that stuff should be there.
[01:17:22.776 --> 01:17:22.976]  Right.
[01:17:23.076 --> 01:17:24.358]  So how can we find it then?
[01:17:25.319 --> 01:17:26.160]  Do you have a computer?
[01:17:27.206 --> 01:17:27.486]  She does.
[01:17:27.526 --> 01:17:28.887]  The mother of the baby.
[01:17:29.007 --> 01:17:32.349]  Okay, tell her to type in cancer viruses in vaccines.
[01:17:32.969 --> 01:17:35.310]  Have her type in mercury in vaccines.
[01:17:36.090 --> 01:17:43.854]  And tens of thousands of things will come up, and most of it will be CBS, AP, Reuters, BBC.
[01:17:44.514 --> 01:17:51.277]  Add medical report or journal of medicine report if you want to get scientific reports.
[01:17:51.577 --> 01:17:52.638]  Hundreds of those will pop up.
[01:17:53.343 --> 01:17:54.124]  But that's how you do it.
[01:17:54.504 --> 01:17:56.325]  Medical report and scientific report?
[01:17:56.845 --> 01:18:00.468]  Well, yeah, I mean, add something like cancer viruses and vaccines, medical journal.
[01:18:01.548 --> 01:18:06.031]  You know, if you want medical journals, you want to actually read a 200-page medical journal.
[01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:08.473]  And you don't really have the facts.
[01:18:08.553 --> 01:18:17.098]  Or if you just want to hear, oh, there's been some questions, they found some more cancer viruses, and they're very deadly, but they said they fixed the problem, it was all accidental.
[01:18:17.439 --> 01:18:19.960]  Just, you know, you'll find that like in CBS News.
[01:18:20.521 --> 01:18:20.741]  Right.
[01:18:21.641 --> 01:18:22.642]  What she's reading now is,
[01:18:23.106 --> 01:18:35.297]  I've given her a bunch of books by doctors, but now the new parenting magazines are coming out saying that, you know, that's just a bunch of crooks out there trying to scare people, and it's really all just fine and safe.
[01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:37.519]  And by the way, we're sponsored by Eli Lilly.
[01:18:39.943 --> 01:18:40.604]  That's what they'll do.
[01:18:40.624 --> 01:18:44.685]  You notice those big parenting magazines that'll say, every other page is drugs for your kids.
[01:18:45.846 --> 01:18:46.986]  These injections are good.
[01:18:47.046 --> 01:18:54.849]  By the way, so is Ritalin on page 5, and so is Prozac for kids on page 10, and half the ads in there are drugs for your children.
[01:18:55.810 --> 01:18:59.131]  The vaccine makers are basically paying for the magazine's publication.
[01:18:59.151 --> 01:18:59.771]  Right.
[01:19:00.191 --> 01:19:01.312]  Now point that out to her.
[01:19:01.572 --> 01:19:06.734]  And then have her type in, show her the Ritalin ad in the magazine.
[01:19:07.515 --> 01:19:10.697]  And then go, okay, type in Ritalin side effects in children.
[01:19:11.298 --> 01:19:12.599]  Medical reports will pop up.
[01:19:12.999 --> 01:19:13.819]  Heart enlargement.
[01:19:13.859 --> 01:19:14.740]  Brain shrinkage.
[01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:16.221]  Retardation of growth.
[01:19:16.281 --> 01:19:17.802]  Retardation of mind.
[01:19:19.623 --> 01:19:20.564]  Hypertension.
[01:19:20.584 --> 01:19:25.688]  I mean, all the same side effects you get from snorting methamphetamine.
[01:19:26.748 --> 01:19:27.029]  Wow.
[01:19:27.449 --> 01:19:27.829]  Yeah.
[01:19:28.029 --> 01:19:29.250]  Well, thank you so much, Alex.
[01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:31.512]  And again, Yahweh bless you and keep you.
[01:19:31.732 --> 01:19:32.092]  Thank you.
[01:19:32.372 --> 01:19:34.854]  And that's Full Spectrum Psychological Warfare.
[01:19:35.515 --> 01:19:39.881]  To go, okay, well, how do you know this magazine's got an agenda?
[01:19:40.202 --> 01:19:43.847]  Well, okay, half the ads in it are from the very drug company selling the vaccines.
[01:19:44.488 --> 01:19:49.595]  So they're telling you a vaccine's good, they're telling you Ritalin's good, and right next to it is a $300,000 full-page ad for Ritalin.
[01:19:54.190 --> 01:19:57.072]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:19:57.432 --> 01:20:00.314]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:20:00.534 --> 01:20:06.738]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[01:20:53.467 --> 01:20:54.408]  Is America bankrupt?
[01:20:54.588 --> 01:20:57.149]  Are we on the verge of an all-out economic collapse?
[01:20:57.469 --> 01:20:59.950]  What can be done to protect your family and assets?
[01:21:00.171 --> 01:21:03.232]  What kinds of investments will be able to withstand an economic meltdown?
[01:21:03.372 --> 01:21:05.914]  The problem is it's not always easy to find great solutions.
[01:21:06.074 --> 01:21:09.716]  And during these dangerous economic times, finding the right solution is crucial.

[01:21:54.145 --> 01:21:55.145]  It's finally here.
[01:21:55.265 --> 01:21:56.246]  Spring has arrived.
[01:21:56.446 --> 01:21:59.406]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:21:59.626 --> 01:22:03.087]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:22:03.287 --> 01:22:11.449]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the ARC Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[01:22:53.903 --> 01:22:56.244]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:22:56.505 --> 01:23:00.347]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:23:00.667 --> 01:23:01.488]  Read the labels.
[01:23:01.908 --> 01:23:06.050]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:23:06.270 --> 01:23:10.453]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:23:10.813 --> 01:23:15.696]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:23:16.076 --> 01:23:19.679]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:23:19.859 --> 01:23:25.203]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:23:25.463 --> 01:23:28.205]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:23:28.506 --> 01:23:29.406]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:23:43.257 --> 01:23:44.457]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:23:44.477 --> 01:23:45.978]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:11.309 --> 01:24:28.700]  Yeah, Johanna, who just called earlier, I just called my webmaster in England for prisonplanet.com, prisonplanet.tv, and I told him I want a big cancer virus, mercury in the vaccine, global population control section.
[01:24:30.101 --> 01:24:35.164]  And so they're going to try to build that, because what happens is we post these articles on the main page, they go into the archive, and then
[01:24:36.176 --> 01:24:36.856]  I think we're good to go.
[01:24:54.372 --> 01:24:55.433]  Try to stay on it.
[01:24:55.733 --> 01:25:09.001]  Tell you what, go to prisonplanet.com, go to the contact webmaster, and help us search Google and send all your mainstream and government documents on cancer viruses and the vaccines to Paul Watson, and we'll post those too.
[01:25:09.481 --> 01:25:14.184]  So instead of 20 articles, because they'll spend a couple hours finding those, we can put a couple hundred on there.
[01:25:14.224 --> 01:25:15.344]  Give Paul lots of work to do.
[01:25:17.184 --> 01:25:22.668]  I can talk to my wife, too, and say, Baby, will you please build that cancer virus section I've been asking for for a year?
[01:25:22.989 --> 01:25:23.929]  But she gets so busy.
[01:25:23.949 --> 01:25:24.630]  I mean, they just do.
[01:25:24.650 --> 01:25:25.550]  There's so much.
[01:25:26.071 --> 01:25:29.313]  Just updating these websites every day takes hours and hours and hours and hours.
[01:25:30.634 --> 01:25:34.977]  Maybe I should create a cancer virus website and just have all that there.
[01:25:35.057 --> 01:25:38.260]  But then you have to build the traffic up on that website.
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:38.760]  No, no, no.
[01:25:39.821 --> 01:25:41.222]  More servers and more...
[01:25:42.105 --> 01:25:44.546]  More webmasters and more money!
[01:25:45.306 --> 01:25:49.868]  Let's go ahead and talk to... We'll dole out more money for all that, folks.
[01:25:50.548 --> 01:25:52.069]  Let's talk to Dylan in Texas.
[01:25:52.129 --> 01:25:52.969]  Dylan, you're on the air.
[01:25:53.029 --> 01:25:53.469]  Go ahead.
[01:25:53.489 --> 01:25:55.110]  Howdy, Alex.
[01:25:55.290 --> 01:25:56.651]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:25:56.731 --> 01:25:57.431]  You bet, my friend.
[01:25:58.311 --> 01:25:59.972]  You're doing a great job today.
[01:26:00.912 --> 01:26:06.194]  That one woman who called a while back talking about Pat Roberts, she sounded pretty intelligent.
[01:26:06.234 --> 01:26:08.415]  I think she just needs to lay off the television.
[01:26:09.617 --> 01:26:14.101]  You pay too much attention to television, you start calling our country a democracy and things like that.
[01:26:15.762 --> 01:26:17.964]  I have a couple of points with examples.
[01:26:18.504 --> 01:26:20.125]  We're not the rebels here.
[01:26:20.185 --> 01:26:21.607]  We're not the revolutionaries.
[01:26:22.347 --> 01:26:32.315]  And I'm not outrageous because I said that a Texas sheriff in Jim Hogg County warned of foreign troops in their border county.
[01:26:32.755 --> 01:26:34.897]  Well, that was actually in the Associated Press.
[01:26:35.818 --> 01:26:38.640]  And then three days later, he comes back and arrests
[01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:41.101]  Members of Ranch Rescue.
[01:26:42.802 --> 01:26:45.343]  And we're down there exposing all of this.
[01:26:46.063 --> 01:26:54.428]  Yeah, www.ranchrescue.com has all these articles of mainstream news articles, Washington Times, Houston Chronicle.
[01:26:55.208 --> 01:27:05.073]  Also, I'm not outrageous for mentioning that Senator Hillary Clinton on the Armed Forces Committee asked the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that's General Richard Myers,
[01:27:05.632 --> 01:27:11.416]  Why are hundreds of servicemen on backlog awaiting testing at Fort Dix, New Jersey, for depleted uranium exposure?
[01:27:11.756 --> 01:27:13.837]  And why is the military not following directives?
[01:27:13.897 --> 01:27:19.601]  But you notice that her husband used all this stuff, and then she comes out against it.
[01:27:19.681 --> 01:27:24.424]  That way conservatives who know that she's bad news go, oh, it must be a lie that Hillary's doing it.
[01:27:24.444 --> 01:27:25.605]  See how they play that game?
[01:27:26.385 --> 01:27:33.410]  Well, you know, if someone needs some other sources, what about the retired Colonel Ossoff-Dorokovic,
[01:27:33.973 --> 01:27:47.979]  Who was the Army's and the Department of Veteran Affairs top expert in the field of... Unfortunately... Unfortunately, all of what you just said cut out.
[01:27:48.019 --> 01:27:49.540]  Your cell phone's having problems.
[01:27:51.241 --> 01:27:51.601]  Oh, okay.
[01:27:52.021 --> 01:27:53.922]  Yeah, he was in the New York... I heard part of that.
[01:27:53.962 --> 01:27:58.624]  He was in the New York Daily News and did the blood test and found incredible levels of uranium in the troops.
[01:27:58.644 --> 01:27:59.464]  Yeah, it's all admitted.
[01:28:00.825 --> 01:28:03.006]  So, uh... And then also, um...
[01:28:03.737 --> 01:28:09.179]  Dr. Rocky, R-O-K-K-E, retired Major Doug Rocky, former U.S.
[01:28:09.219 --> 01:28:20.123]  Army Depleted Uranium Project Director, stated that 221,000-plus casualties resulted from Gulf War I and 10,000-plus Gulf War I servicemen are now dead.
[01:28:22.424 --> 01:28:25.045]  I have one question for you, Alex, because it's a real good thing.
[01:28:25.085 --> 01:28:28.966]  I'd like to mention to people, it was brought up earlier by someone else.
[01:28:29.026 --> 01:28:30.026]  Go ahead and bring it up.
[01:28:30.046 --> 01:28:30.787]  We're almost out of time.
[01:28:32.399 --> 01:28:38.427]  Where can I get statistics on when populations are industrialized, they stop growing?
[01:28:39.888 --> 01:28:41.130]  Man, that's all over the place.
[01:28:41.190 --> 01:28:42.912]  Just type in your keyword search.
[01:28:43.833 --> 01:28:46.697]  They have billboards up in Germany telling people to have children.
[01:28:47.395 --> 01:28:49.896]  I think they're having like an average of 1.2 children there.
[01:28:50.016 --> 01:28:52.156]  Well, if you've got two parents, they have 1.2 children.
[01:28:52.916 --> 01:28:56.017]  There are huge cities that are like partial ghost towns.
[01:28:56.957 --> 01:28:59.417]  France, I think, has like 1.6 children.
[01:29:00.338 --> 01:29:02.178]  England has like 1.8 children.
[01:29:02.758 --> 01:29:08.339]  The U.S., the indigenous population, whether you're black, white, or Hispanic, has about 1.7 children.
[01:29:08.359 --> 01:29:11.340]  But then we have the giant immigrant influx, so we grow about 2-3% a year.
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:18.522]  But, no, I mean, once a country industrializes, its population growth goes into a negative dive.
[01:29:20.483 --> 01:29:21.143]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:29:21.623 --> 01:29:22.023]  Thank you.
[01:29:22.123 --> 01:29:23.844]  That's just all, I mean, that's out there.
[01:29:23.864 --> 01:29:24.604]  That's all over the place.
[01:29:25.784 --> 01:29:32.506]  Let's just keyword searches, folks, on your major search engines.
[01:29:32.566 --> 01:29:34.587]  And Google ought to pay me as a sponsor.
[01:29:35.587 --> 01:29:37.488]  You know, Google's pretty new world order, folks.
[01:29:37.508 --> 01:29:38.668]  They're the best search engine I know of.
[01:29:39.388 --> 01:29:40.589]  Okay, we'll be right back.
[01:29:40.609 --> 01:29:40.969]  Stay with us.
[01:29:44.139 --> 01:29:45.080]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:47.161]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:48.062 --> 01:29:50.864]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:54.106 --> 01:29:57.708]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[01:29:57.748 --> 01:29:59.350]  I've tried many, many products.
[01:29:59.490 --> 01:30:01.771]  I have never experienced anything like college naked.
[01:30:02.252 --> 01:30:06.074]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than eight weeks.
[01:30:06.494 --> 01:30:07.195]  It truly works.
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:08.741]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[01:30:09.141 --> 01:30:15.085]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:30:15.165 --> 01:30:21.308]  Vim and Vigor's collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism, and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[01:30:21.648 --> 01:30:25.611]  Our listeners keep telling us Vim and Vigor's collagenate really does work.
[01:30:26.071 --> 01:30:27.092]  It's healthy for you, too.
[01:30:27.472 --> 01:30:34.998]  In addition to helping you lose weight, collagenate is also designed to improve strength and health of muscles, joints, skin, hair, and nails.
[01:30:35.398 --> 01:30:37.620]  So take collagenate and rejuvenate.
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:38.761]  Call Vim and Vigor today.
[01:30:38.781 --> 01:30:39.041]  1-800-622-THIN.
[01:30:39.101 --> 01:30:39.301]  That's 1-800-622-8446.

[01:31:46.789 --> 01:31:49.557]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:31:54.383 --> 01:31:55.384]  Stop the pill-popping.
[01:31:55.544 --> 01:31:59.386]  No more trying to remember to take all those vitamins daily that don't entirely absorb.
[01:31:59.486 --> 01:32:00.707]  Stop fishing out cash.
[01:32:00.787 --> 01:32:06.871]  To get all the vitamins and nutrients your body needs, you'll have to pay hundreds of dollars per month and still be missing out on the essentials.
[01:32:07.011 --> 01:32:14.176]  What if I told you I'm about to save you all the time and money with a product that provides all the nutritional groups that support every function of the human anatomy?
[01:32:14.376 --> 01:32:15.897]  It's called ProVitamin Complete.
[01:32:15.977 --> 01:32:17.198]  The name speaks for itself.

[01:32:43.206 --> 01:32:44.646]  Or check out their banner on GCNlive.com.
[01:32:56.852 --> 01:33:02.896]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:33:03.497 --> 01:33:06.479]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:09.821 --> 01:33:20.469]  All right, let me get into some Bilderberg Group news and some of the Patriot Act criminal activities that are going on by this illegal, illegitimate dictatorship.
[01:33:22.270 --> 01:33:33.693]  And then we'll get back to your calls at 1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231, for Dylan and others, Danny and others that are patiently holding.
[01:33:35.253 --> 01:33:45.935]  To answer Dylan's question from the last segment, type into a search engine, Western populations declining, Western populations dying.
[01:33:45.975 --> 01:33:48.716]  I mean, that's what Buchanan's whole book, Death of the West, is about.
[01:33:50.271 --> 01:33:51.592]  And you'll get all the statistics.
[01:33:51.612 --> 01:33:54.134]  So type in Western population statistics.
[01:33:54.994 --> 01:33:57.276]  Western population births and deaths.
[01:33:57.536 --> 01:33:59.718]  And, I mean, I see those articles probably once a month.
[01:34:00.798 --> 01:34:03.300]  Huge declines all over the Western world.
[01:34:04.441 --> 01:34:11.646]  And also, not just the Western world, Japan is even worse than a lot of Western countries.
[01:34:12.604 --> 01:34:15.305]  They have a plunging... I forget the numbers with them.
[01:34:15.325 --> 01:34:16.846]  I think it's like one child.
[01:34:16.906 --> 01:34:17.766]  I think it's 1.1.
[01:34:18.086 --> 01:34:18.987]  But I'm going from memory.
[01:34:20.087 --> 01:34:20.787]  It's the worst.
[01:34:22.048 --> 01:34:23.789]  Japan is the worst.
[01:34:24.409 --> 01:34:25.449]  They are dying.
[01:34:25.649 --> 01:34:31.292]  There won't be any Japanese in a couple generations at this rate.
[01:34:32.692 --> 01:34:37.594]  And so the globalists say we've got to stop industrialization for the general public.
[01:34:37.614 --> 01:34:38.495]  We've got to take over.
[01:34:38.555 --> 01:34:41.876]  We've got to have sustainability, which is a code word for feudalism.
[01:34:42.689 --> 01:34:44.531]  We've got to do all this in the third world.
[01:34:44.551 --> 01:34:46.832]  We need to go back to the agrarian society.
[01:34:47.713 --> 01:34:53.137]  That's what causes people to have 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 children, which I think is fine, frankly.
[01:34:53.157 --> 01:34:56.039]  We've got, you know, that's your right to do that.
[01:34:56.079 --> 01:34:58.421]  And we've actually, the statistics show we've got plenty of land.
[01:34:59.422 --> 01:35:03.565]  It's some of the industrial practices that have been bad for the environment, but they're now being cleaned up.
[01:35:04.766 --> 01:35:06.347]  So it's really a fraud, folks.
[01:35:06.387 --> 01:35:08.429]  But going back to the agrarian society...
[01:35:09.170 --> 01:35:15.813]  The Farming Society, that you'd have a bunch of children because usually about a third of them would die with no science of prenatal care.
[01:35:17.094 --> 01:35:20.716]  And on top of that, that was your hands to work the fields and take care of you in old age.
[01:35:21.856 --> 01:35:25.398]  But for those that are telling the West not to have children, I mean, come on!
[01:35:26.158 --> 01:35:27.519]  Oh, there's too many children in the world.
[01:35:27.579 --> 01:35:28.479]  I shouldn't have children.
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:30.140]  The West is dying.
[01:35:30.821 --> 01:35:32.181]  Japan is dying.
[01:35:33.022 --> 01:35:36.803]  Every other country that's been industrialized for more than 50 years is dying.
[01:35:39.230 --> 01:35:40.771]  At a massive rate.
[01:35:40.791 --> 01:35:45.315]  All right, I don't want to get off into that all day long here.
[01:35:45.815 --> 01:35:51.360]  Let me cover this Patriot Act story from Newsweek, then I'll get into the Bilderberg Group news.
[01:35:53.141 --> 01:36:00.827]  Now, again, I'm not tooting my horn, but they have to announce this years after once it's already in place, and they just incrementally condition you to it.
[01:36:01.988 --> 01:36:02.989]  I read the Patriot Act.
[01:36:03.610 --> 01:36:06.472]  Every car you buy, house you buy, you sell, you're renters.
[01:36:07.589 --> 01:36:15.875]  Everything you do, your bank accounts, being scanned by the NSA, given to local police, has nothing to do with terror.
[01:36:16.555 --> 01:36:23.620]  It flags you if you haven't paid tickets, or if you have warrants, or they profile you for social services to come after you.
[01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:25.041]  I mean, it's serious business.
[01:36:25.962 --> 01:36:28.563]  And this is a news week, putting their spin on it.
[01:36:29.864 --> 01:36:33.246]  The Patriot Search, buying a home, prepare to pay.
[01:36:33.266 --> 01:36:33.967]  You have to pay for it.
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:38.063]  To have your name checked against a government list of suspected terrorists.
[01:36:39.243 --> 01:36:40.224]  You see, that's the lie.
[01:36:40.545 --> 01:36:45.989]  It's really true when lawyers speak, but the spirit of the law is a lie.
[01:36:46.689 --> 01:36:49.292]  Yes, we're all terrorists under Section 802.
[01:36:49.772 --> 01:36:53.055]  If you're suspected of a misdemeanor, non-terror related, you're a terrorist.
[01:36:53.715 --> 01:36:55.417]  So I guess that statement in a way is true.
[01:36:55.957 --> 01:36:59.640]  Yes, to check and see if you're a terrorist, if you've ever committed a misdemeanor.
[01:37:00.581 --> 01:37:01.882]  Or have bad credit, by the way.
[01:37:01.902 --> 01:37:04.464]  You know the whole CAPS-2 system to fly, they check that as well.
[01:37:05.788 --> 01:37:09.349]  Buying a home can be stressful, expensive, and bewildering.
[01:37:09.629 --> 01:37:15.492]  Essentially, a humorous Dave Barry wrote in his 1988 book, Homes and Other Black Holes.
[01:37:16.112 --> 01:37:23.755]  What you must do in the ritual closing ceremony is go into a small room and write large checks to total strangers according to tradition.
[01:37:24.215 --> 01:37:27.736]  Anybody may ask you for a check for any amount, and you may not refuse.
[01:37:28.457 --> 01:37:32.278]  He may have been joking, but the number of checks homeowners and buyers are big.
[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:35.921]  Being asked to write has recently increased by one.
[01:37:36.942 --> 01:37:39.643]  So see, they just, oh, this is part of the harassment.
[01:37:39.683 --> 01:37:41.704]  This is just part of life.
[01:37:41.764 --> 01:37:42.524]  It's kind of fun.
[01:37:43.365 --> 01:37:57.931]  With the passage of the Patriot Act of 2001, which required the financial institutions to create anti-money laundering systems, compliance programs, anyone purchasing property must be checked against a list of names of known and suspected terrorists.
[01:37:58.451 --> 01:38:01.373]  That list has been around since before the September 11 attacks.
[01:38:01.433 --> 01:38:01.913]  Oh, really?
[01:38:02.532 --> 01:38:10.357]  But increasingly, the ritual closing ceremony has involved writing yet another check to the title company that runs a home buyer's name against the list.
[01:38:11.258 --> 01:38:11.978]  What's behind it?
[01:38:12.018 --> 01:38:25.768]  The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control maintains the specifically designed nationals, designated nationals, list of people blocked from participating in any transaction or dealing in property or interest.
[01:38:26.168 --> 01:38:28.910]  So see now, if you have any crimes you won't be able to buy or sell.
[01:38:29.642 --> 01:38:32.104]  Within the United States, just like buying the hunting license.
[01:38:32.324 --> 01:38:33.705]  Hadn't paid your tickets, can't have one.
[01:38:34.245 --> 01:38:39.769]  These people have been identified to have committed or to pose a significant risk of committing acts of terrorism.
[01:38:40.329 --> 01:38:42.511]  And they bracket that.
[01:38:42.551 --> 01:38:43.371]  They don't continue.
[01:38:43.451 --> 01:38:44.432]  I read the subsection.
[01:38:44.832 --> 01:38:45.913]  It gets into all crimes.
[01:38:46.353 --> 01:38:55.980]  According to White House Executive Order 13224, which was issued September 24, 2001, although the blocked persons list has been around in some cases,
[01:38:56.633 --> 01:39:08.058]  In some form, for about a decade, O.C., under the order of private individuals, be they jewelers, pawnbrokers, or suburban families, buying or selling property are now considered financial institutions.
[01:39:08.118 --> 01:39:08.358]  Yeah.
[01:39:08.798 --> 01:39:16.522]  When you go to Half Price Books in Austin to sell your books, they mark down what you're selling and what it is, your name, and that's all.
[01:39:16.882 --> 01:39:19.203]  And it's actually a police department registry book.
[01:39:20.283 --> 01:39:21.464]  It's all part of the freedom, folks.
[01:39:22.379 --> 01:39:23.580]  Because you're a financial institution.
[01:39:24.101 --> 01:39:29.226]  And the responsibility has fallen to the title companies to check all parties involved in the transaction against the list.
[01:39:29.546 --> 01:39:30.787]  So that's indentured servitude.
[01:39:32.168 --> 01:39:35.051]  The SDN list has been around for years, obviously since 9-11.
[01:39:35.091 --> 01:39:41.097]  The use of charities and banks and different organizations for tariffs to move money have brought it more to light in recent years.
[01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:51.748]  Says Molly Millerwise, a Treasury spokeswoman, explaining why homebuyers in the heartland are considered financial institutions under the jurisdiction of the Office of Foreign Assets.
[01:39:51.768 --> 01:39:53.049]  See, it's all admiralty law.
[01:39:53.369 --> 01:39:54.350]  You're a foreigner.
[01:39:54.630 --> 01:39:55.631]  You're an enemy combatant.
[01:39:55.651 --> 01:39:56.792]  We're all enemy combatants.
[01:39:56.852 --> 01:39:59.654]  Then we're brought outside the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:40:00.935 --> 01:40:05.179]  She says the Office of Foreign Assets Control Terrorists, she says, use property to launder money.
[01:40:06.129 --> 01:40:14.992]  But some lawyers and civil libertarians question the assertion, it's not a valid liquid investment, says Ann Von Egan of the American Land Title Association.
[01:40:15.032 --> 01:40:21.654]  You would have to, if you planned on laundering money for real estate, make sure your appreciation is better than the cost of your transaction.
[01:40:22.894 --> 01:40:23.575]  Again, folks.
[01:40:27.496 --> 01:40:28.236]  This is amazing.
[01:40:28.256 --> 01:40:33.158]  You know, we all hear about how when you go get a library book, they track that.
[01:40:33.298 --> 01:40:33.458]  Uh-uh.
[01:40:33.818 --> 01:40:34.638]  Not just the libraries.
[01:40:35.479 --> 01:40:37.040]  It's bookstores, period.
[01:40:38.821 --> 01:40:51.210]  And we've read the cases on air in the last month where a British citizen, a white guy, imagine how bad it is if you happen to be an Arab, comes in and they think he may not have paid off a car for $2,000.
[01:40:51.390 --> 01:40:53.611]  That's on his credit report.
[01:40:53.932 --> 01:41:00.256]  They arrested him, this is the Associated Press, for 24 hours with no water because he had bad credit.
[01:41:02.137 --> 01:41:03.798]  Then it turned out he had paid off the car.
[01:41:03.818 --> 01:41:04.459]  It was a mistake.
[01:41:05.097 --> 01:41:06.957]  I mean, I see these reports all the time.
[01:41:08.598 --> 01:41:17.940]  Type in CAPS 2, looks at your credit, and it'll pop up, you know, ABC News, all of it, where it says, oh, your credit means you get a search, a strip search.
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:20.120]  You know, that's a sign of terrorism now.
[01:41:20.660 --> 01:41:22.581]  No, it's a sign of them setting up debtors' prisons.
[01:41:23.941 --> 01:41:28.182]  So, I mean, this is your new freedom, more tracked than the Nazis ever dreamed of tracking people.
[01:41:29.984 --> 01:41:33.425]  Okay, I want to get into the Bilderberg Group articles here.
[01:41:33.445 --> 01:41:35.186]  This is all really, really important.
[01:41:35.626 --> 01:41:37.386]  We'll get to your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:41:37.406 --> 01:41:46.049]  Number one, the Bilderberg Group was set up in the early 1950s at the Bilderberg Hotel.
[01:41:47.110 --> 01:41:48.730]  The group had already been meeting long before.
[01:41:48.750 --> 01:41:52.531]  A top Dutch Nazi, the Prince, set it up.
[01:41:54.772 --> 01:41:57.513]  And the British royalty, the Dutch royalty, the French royalty...
[01:41:59.068 --> 01:42:00.710]  The Saudi royalty all goes.
[01:42:00.730 --> 01:42:17.426]  It's admitted, you know, Reuters has reported the Rothschilds land by armored helicopter, the Rockefellers land, and there's only a couple hundred members, and then a few senators, a few members of parliament from different countries will show up, and they're questioned and quizzed and told about the agenda, and they say they'll go along with it.
[01:42:17.906 --> 01:42:19.968]  Suddenly, they're going to be in the front pages of the paper.
[01:42:19.988 --> 01:42:21.770]  They'll be your next prime minister, chancellor.
[01:42:22.290 --> 01:42:22.991]  This is all admitted.
[01:42:24.597 --> 01:42:26.619]  Now, just five years ago, you talk about Bilderberg Group.
[01:42:26.679 --> 01:42:27.539]  It didn't exist.
[01:42:27.579 --> 01:42:30.301]  The news would attack you and say that you're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:42:30.321 --> 01:42:31.922]  Well, now it's all over the foreign press.
[01:42:33.543 --> 01:42:47.694]  And we have the Netherlands Telegraph, their biggest paper, translated from the Dutch, on prisonplanet.com, members of Dutch Labour Party at 52nd Bilderberg Conference, and they just report it like it's no big deal.
[01:42:47.774 --> 01:42:49.595]  Our world leaders are there making decisions.
[01:42:50.347 --> 01:42:52.188]  They'll then give the orders to the ministers.
[01:42:52.268 --> 01:42:59.490]  They'll go to the G8 and direct the policy at more of a micromanaged level next week.
[01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:08.233]  And then it goes into the other lower-level management bodies of the Trilateral Commission, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the Council on Foreign Relations that are multi-thousand members.
[01:43:10.234 --> 01:43:15.376]  But let me just read the comments that we put in here over this BBC article.
[01:43:15.416 --> 01:43:16.416]  And let me cover this first.
[01:43:17.119 --> 01:43:20.883]  We also have Turkish Newsline, the equivalent of their AP.
[01:43:21.363 --> 01:43:23.205]  Turkish State Minister leaves for Italy.
[01:43:23.625 --> 01:43:30.051]  Turkish State Minister Ali Bakan left on Thursday for Italy to attend the Bilderberg Conference 2004.
[01:43:30.712 --> 01:43:33.294]  They just report like it's no big deal.
[01:43:34.075 --> 01:43:37.078]  Limbaugh says it doesn't exist, even though the CFR publishes his books.
[01:43:37.558 --> 01:43:42.363]  Turkish State Minister Ali Bakan left on Thursday for Italy to attend the Bilderberg Conference 2004.
[01:43:43.207 --> 01:43:45.348]  He is expected to return to Turkey on Sunday.
[01:43:45.408 --> 01:43:48.630]  Speeches made at the Bilderberg conference are kept secret as a condition.
[01:43:48.970 --> 01:43:53.131]  These meetings are named after the hotel in the Netherlands where the first of the meetings was held in 1954.
[01:43:53.232 --> 01:43:55.673]  Press is not allowed to cover the meeting.
[01:43:55.873 --> 01:43:58.434]  The venue and date of the meeting is also kept secret.
[01:43:59.774 --> 01:44:03.636]  And then here's the Netherlands major newspaper admitting all of it.
[01:44:04.076 --> 01:44:05.277]  Now here's BBC.
[01:44:05.377 --> 01:44:10.179]  Now the BBC last year admitted that they're basically running things from the Bilderberg group.
[01:44:10.683 --> 01:44:14.606]  But the new, punished, taken-over BBC says it's not true.
[01:44:16.207 --> 01:44:16.967]  This is our comment.
[01:44:16.987 --> 01:44:17.547]  It's BBC.
[01:44:17.768 --> 01:44:20.609]  If you think Goldberg has power, you're with McVeigh and Bin Laden.
[01:44:21.390 --> 01:44:29.115]  And a few months ago, the Harvard Journal came out and said that if you believe in world government, you're secretly a Nazi, as world government's being announced on the news.
[01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:32.252]  Don't read this nightmare piece of journalism before you go to bed.
[01:44:32.312 --> 01:44:33.153]  You'll have bad dreams.
[01:44:33.673 --> 01:44:39.137]  This criminally bad report links anyone that thinks Bilderbergs have power with world-renowned terrorists.
[01:44:39.518 --> 01:44:49.746]  There's also the rudimentary Jewish conspiracy tactic used, a pathetic worn-out attempt to brand anyone who thinks 200 world leaders meeting in secret is interesting as a racist.
[01:44:50.882 --> 01:45:01.309]  If Bilderberger has no power, perhaps Jonathan Duffy, the writer, can explain to me how Bilderberg's own archives discuss the creation of the EU and the single currency years before the EU even existed.
[01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:07.194]  Perhaps Mr. Duffy should talk to his colleagues at the BBC because they reported on it a year ago.
[01:45:08.555 --> 01:45:13.078]  But then again, actually doing some real investigation and simple reading seems to be beyond Mr. Duffy.
[01:45:13.778 --> 01:45:16.020]  This is why he goes to self-proclaimed...
[01:45:16.997 --> 01:45:18.258]  Experts on conspiracy theory.
[01:45:18.618 --> 01:45:25.302]  The spoon feed him the naive bubble-wrapped fallacy that powerful people do not exercise power.
[01:45:25.862 --> 01:45:26.402]  Of course they don't.
[01:45:26.882 --> 01:45:29.424]  And that anyone who believes they do is working with Al-Qaeda.
[01:45:29.984 --> 01:45:33.346]  Shouldn't we expect that the rich and powerful organize things in their own interest?
[01:45:34.106 --> 01:45:35.187]  It's called capitalism.
[01:45:35.247 --> 01:45:37.448]  No, my friend, it's called dictatorship.
[01:45:37.628 --> 01:45:39.029]  Look in the dictionary.
[01:45:41.391 --> 01:45:45.595]  And then continuing, Bilderberg, the ultimate conspiracy theory.
[01:45:45.635 --> 01:45:46.756]  This is from BBC.
[01:45:47.737 --> 01:46:00.388]  The Bilderberg Group, an elite group of Western thinkers and power brokers, has been accused of fixing the fate of the world behind closed doors as the organization marks its 50th anniversary.
[01:46:00.708 --> 01:46:02.349]  Rumors are more rife than ever.
[01:46:03.170 --> 01:46:03.610]  Rumors?
[01:46:04.111 --> 01:46:08.735]  Our people sneak in there and then tell us a year in advance of what's going to happen, and it happens right on time.
[01:46:09.115 --> 01:46:09.195]  Huh.
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:18.523]  Given its reputation as perhaps the most powerful organization in the world, the Bilderberg Group doesn't go a bundle on its switchboard operations.
[01:46:18.583 --> 01:46:19.343]  Ha, ha, ha.
[01:46:20.083 --> 01:46:33.367]  Telephone inquiries are met with an impersonal female voice, the Dutch equivalent of the BT cowminder woman, reciting back the number and inviting callers to leave a message after the tone.
[01:46:34.435 --> 01:46:40.280]  Anyone who accidentally dialed the number would probably think they had stumbled onto just another residential answering machine.
[01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:42.582]  Oh, see, the Bilderberg group isn't a big deal.
[01:46:43.383 --> 01:46:46.025]  You know, mafia groups should have big public offices.
[01:46:46.725 --> 01:46:51.990]  But behind this ultra-modest facade lies one of the most controversial and hotly debated alliances of our times.
[01:46:52.850 --> 01:46:57.614]  On Thursday, the Bilderberg group marks its 50th anniversary, as yesterday, with the start of its yearly meeting.
[01:46:57.975 --> 01:47:00.477]  For four days, some of the... it's actually three and a half...
[01:47:01.423 --> 01:47:10.549]  The West's chief political movers, business leaders, bankers, industrialists, and strategic thinkers will hunker down in a five-star hotel in northern Italy to talk about global issues.
[01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:19.035]  What sets Bilderberg apart from the high-powered get-toughers such as the annual World Economic Forum is its mystique.
[01:47:19.496 --> 01:47:20.516]  Well, it's all the same people.
[01:47:21.477 --> 01:47:24.619]  Not a word of what is said at Bilderberg meetings can be breathed outside.
[01:47:24.679 --> 01:47:29.923]  No reporters are invited in, and with confidential minutes of meetings are taken, names are not noted.
[01:47:30.586 --> 01:47:32.508]  The shadowy aura expands further.
[01:47:32.548 --> 01:47:37.212]  The anonymous answering phone message, for example.
[01:47:37.252 --> 01:47:39.294]  The fact that the conference venues are kept secret.
[01:47:39.314 --> 01:47:45.879]  The group, which includes luminaries such as Henry Kissinger, former UK Chancellor Kenneth Clark, does not even have a website.
[01:47:46.780 --> 01:47:56.609]  In the void created by such aloofness and extraordinary conspiracy theories, where it gets good, has grown up around the group that alleges the fate of the world is largely decided by Bilderberg.
[01:47:57.293 --> 01:48:03.377]  In Yugoslavia, leading Serbs have blamed Bilderberg for triggering the war which led to the downfall of Slovan Milajevic.
[01:48:03.978 --> 01:48:05.339]  Well, Tucker said that was going to happen.
[01:48:05.359 --> 01:48:06.800]  He got the info from inside again.
[01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:20.530]  The Oklahoma City bomber, Timothy McVeigh, the London nail bomber, David Copeland, and Osama bin Laden are all said to have been brought into the theory that Bilderberg pulls the strings with which national governments dance.
[01:48:20.590 --> 01:48:22.571]  Well, bin Laden's CIA.
[01:48:23.052 --> 01:48:24.473]  He was used by them
[01:48:25.350 --> 01:48:26.651]  Two attack the Serbs.
[01:48:26.691 --> 01:48:28.452]  That's a Senate report by Republicans.
[01:48:28.992 --> 01:48:30.213]  Oh, but I read Senate reports.
[01:48:30.253 --> 01:48:30.613]  You don't.
[01:48:31.213 --> 01:48:32.034]  So see right there.
[01:48:32.074 --> 01:48:33.415]  Ooh, McVeigh, Bin Laden.
[01:48:34.635 --> 01:48:35.916]  Ooh, they talk about it.
[01:48:35.976 --> 01:48:37.177]  Ooh, maybe you're with them.
[01:48:37.997 --> 01:48:46.182]  And while hardline right-wingers and libertarians... Oh, so now if you're a libertarian, you're pretty mainstream.
[01:48:46.202 --> 01:48:47.382]  You're with a right-winger.
[01:48:47.883 --> 01:48:48.103]  Listen.
[01:48:48.123 --> 01:48:49.123]  It continues.
[01:48:49.444 --> 01:48:53.626]  Oh, while hardline right-wingers and libertarians accuse Bilderberg of being a liberal Zionist plot.
[01:48:54.406 --> 01:48:55.827]  Libertarians don't do that.
[01:48:56.827 --> 01:49:01.930]  Leftists such as activist Tony Gosling are equally critical.
[01:49:03.291 --> 01:49:06.532]  So see, oh, yes, it's everybody.
[01:49:06.612 --> 01:49:08.173]  It's all secretly evil.
[01:49:08.914 --> 01:49:13.156]  A former journalist, Mr. Gosling, runs a campaign against the group from his home in Bristol.
[01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:15.240]  My main problem is the secrecy.
[01:49:15.701 --> 01:49:21.362]  When so many people with so much power get together in one place, I think we are owed an explanation of what is going on.
[01:49:21.402 --> 01:49:34.426]  Mr. Gosling seizes on a quote of Will Hutton, the British economist and former Bilderberg delegate who linked it to the annual WEF gathering where the consensus established in the backdrop against which policy is made worldwide.
[01:49:35.786 --> 01:49:37.667]  That's the top of British economists saying that.
[01:49:38.585 --> 01:49:41.587]  One of the first places I heard about the determination of U.S.
[01:49:41.647 --> 01:49:47.330]  forces to attack Iraq was from leaks that came out of the 2002 Bilderberg meeting, Mr. Gosling said.
[01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:49.952]  Yeah, big Jim Tucker, 26 years infiltrating it.
[01:49:50.632 --> 01:49:58.817]  But privacy rather than secrecy is key to such meetings, says Financial Times journalist Martin Wolf, who has been invited several times to non-reporting role.
[01:49:59.238 --> 01:50:00.418]  Oh, but you can't report.
[01:50:00.478 --> 01:50:00.979]  Why's that?
[01:50:01.399 --> 01:50:03.640]  Oh, but he's a member now, so it's okay.
[01:50:04.741 --> 01:50:08.063]  The idea that such meetings cannot be held in private is fundamentally totalitarian.
[01:50:09.001 --> 01:50:12.523]  You're the guy setting up the totalitarian system that want to know everything we're saying and doing, buddy.
[01:50:13.023 --> 01:50:14.244]  It's not an executive body.
[01:50:14.304 --> 01:50:15.344]  No decisions are taken there.
[01:50:15.904 --> 01:50:16.985]  They set the policy.
[01:50:17.885 --> 01:50:30.651]  This is the top economist who's a member just said, as an up-and-coming statesman in the 50s, Dennis Healy, who went on to become a labor chancellor, was one of the four founding members of Bilderberg, which was named after the hotel in Holland where the meeting was first held.
[01:50:31.357 --> 01:50:39.646]  His response to claims that Bilderberg exerts a shadowy hand on the global tiller is met with charismatic bluntness and expletive.
[01:50:40.427 --> 01:50:41.649]  There's absolutely nothing to it.
[01:50:41.669 --> 01:50:44.892]  We never sought to create reach of consensus on the big issues at Bilderberg.
[01:50:44.932 --> 01:50:46.895]  It's simply a place to discern.
[01:50:47.255 --> 01:50:49.778]  For discussion, says Lord Healy.
[01:50:49.818 --> 01:50:50.619]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:53.934 --> 01:50:58.280]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:02.886]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:51:03.047 --> 01:51:07.432]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:51:07.473 --> 01:51:08.814]  The New World Order.
[01:51:10.596 --> 01:51:14.801]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:51:14.881 --> 01:51:21.809]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:51:21.949 --> 01:51:23.952]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:51:24.332 --> 01:51:34.696]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:51:34.936 --> 01:51:40.298]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:51:53.283 --> 01:52:01.547]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:52:01.787 --> 01:52:06.148]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:52:06.449 --> 01:52:15.352]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[01:52:19.474 --> 01:52:24.499]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:31.507]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:52:32.020 --> 01:52:32.681]  What about you?

[01:54:02.398 --> 01:54:11.645]  Now understand, we ought to go dig up the articles five, six years ago in the BBC and Reuters where they went, Bilderberg doesn't exist, evil racists say it does.
[01:54:11.665 --> 01:54:13.326]  I mean, that was the line.
[01:54:13.366 --> 01:54:14.026]  It doesn't exist.
[01:54:14.066 --> 01:54:22.312]  Now it's, oh, it exists because you exposed it, but you're either an evil leftist or an evil libertarian or a Nazi or worse if you even talk about it.
[01:54:23.399 --> 01:54:30.085]  It says, the activists have seized on Bilderberg is no surprise to Alistair Spark, an expert on conspiracy theories.
[01:54:30.165 --> 01:54:33.908]  Quote, the idea that a shadowy clique is running the world is nothing new.
[01:54:34.228 --> 01:54:37.951]  For hundreds of years, people have believed the world is governed by a cabal of Jews.
[01:54:38.292 --> 01:54:40.113]  So they try to bring that race thing into it.
[01:54:40.814 --> 01:54:44.497]  Shouldn't we expect that rich and powerful organize things in their own interest?
[01:54:44.617 --> 01:54:45.738]  It's called capitalism.
[01:54:46.178 --> 01:54:48.020]  No, sir, it's called dictatorship.
[01:54:49.421 --> 01:54:51.763]  And literally, we've had our spies in there.
[01:54:52.239 --> 01:54:53.440]  American Free Press has.
[01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:55.161]  They've gotten the documents out.
[01:54:55.241 --> 01:54:56.742]  They set the policy.
[01:54:57.322 --> 01:54:58.783]  No, Bush, you will not invade in 2002.
[01:54:58.883 --> 01:55:00.604]  You'll invade in 2003.
[01:55:02.405 --> 01:55:03.806]  We're going to have a war in the Balkans.
[01:55:03.826 --> 01:55:04.566]  We're going to do this.
[01:55:04.607 --> 01:55:05.447]  We're going to do that.
[01:55:05.567 --> 01:55:12.892]  I mean, it's literally 200 lords and kings and queens and Rothschilds and Rockefellers.
[01:55:12.952 --> 01:55:13.532]  It's admitted!
[01:55:14.481 --> 01:55:30.913]  And they sit in there, and then all the CFR and trilateral commission heads are there, and then they go back to the 2,000 member groups and 500 member groups, and they all sit as the bank chairman and the heads of industry and the heads of government and universities, and they set the policy.
[01:55:30.953 --> 01:55:32.154]  I mean, this is how it works.
[01:55:32.774 --> 01:55:35.696]  The CFR brags about it in their own publication.
[01:55:36.197 --> 01:55:37.858]  Foreign affairs, bimonthly.
[01:55:38.958 --> 01:55:40.039]  New world order, this.
[01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:41.800]  Global government, that.
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:42.801]  Global tax, this.
[01:55:42.841 --> 01:55:43.802]  Global tax, that.
[01:55:45.418 --> 01:55:53.844]  The Bilderbergers have now bragged the last two years and released their own corporate minutes from their first meeting in 1954, and it said, we will create an EU.
[01:55:54.124 --> 01:55:57.206]  We will have a world cashless society.
[01:55:57.246 --> 01:55:58.567]  We will control everything.
[01:55:58.587 --> 01:56:00.928]  I mean, this is released!
[01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:05.031]  But no, the elite doesn't want more power.
[01:56:05.791 --> 01:56:06.852]  They don't run anything.
[01:56:07.052 --> 01:56:08.853]  And then the last quote is,
[01:56:10.549 --> 01:56:16.032]  The last quote in the article is, well, yes, shouldn't we expect that rich and powerful organize things in their own interest?
[01:56:17.513 --> 01:56:19.234]  Then they just admit it at the end of it.
[01:56:21.235 --> 01:56:23.216]  Kind of a, you know, c'est la vie.
[01:56:23.656 --> 01:56:33.862]  Look, I know we have a load of phone lines, and I'll get to Danny and Chris and Tony and Rich and Bill and others as soon as we start the third hour of global transmission.
[01:56:35.123 --> 01:56:39.245]  I've got some more on Bilderberg Group here, too, and I want to get into Big Brother is Driving You.
[01:56:40.192 --> 01:56:41.894]  This is out of the New Haven Advocate.
[01:56:42.074 --> 01:56:47.780]  Yeah, we need to go ahead and have satellite tagging and tracking and taxation.
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:48.901]  And yeah, it's good for you.
[01:56:48.941 --> 01:56:50.022]  Big Brother's going to watch you.
[01:56:50.042 --> 01:56:52.004]  We're going to have cameras in the cars, too.
[01:56:52.064 --> 01:56:52.765]  It's all wonderful.
[01:56:52.785 --> 01:56:53.466]  We'll get into that.
[01:56:54.407 --> 01:56:59.552]  And just a whole plethora of other vital news and information I haven't even gotten to after we take some calls.
[01:56:59.652 --> 01:57:03.136]  But as I close out this second hour...
[01:57:04.631 --> 01:57:15.958]  If you want to expose the globalists, if you want to know the truth about 9-11, if you want to help expose the murderers, those that are guilty, the globalists, you need to get my film, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, part two of it.
[01:57:16.278 --> 01:57:17.339]  The Masters of Terror.
[01:57:17.399 --> 01:57:18.700]  Both are over two hours long.
[01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:20.441]  Very well produced.
[01:57:20.461 --> 01:57:21.161]  You need to have them.
[01:57:21.201 --> 01:57:22.022]  Very well documented.
[01:57:23.544 --> 01:57:25.645]  We carry a bunch of other videos and books on 9-11.
[01:57:25.905 --> 01:57:27.805]  Eric Huffschmidt's videos and books.
[01:57:28.526 --> 01:57:31.587]  George Humphrey's books and books on tape that are excellent.

[01:58:38.262 --> 01:58:39.843]  We've got to wake these sheeple up.
[01:58:40.363 --> 01:58:41.484]  We'll be right back with the third hour.

[01:59:51.870 --> 01:59:52.951]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:53.631 --> 01:59:54.772]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:54.792 --> 01:59:56.273]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.953 --> 01:59:57.874]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:58.534 --> 02:00:02.417]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.717 --> 02:00:06.820]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:08.456 --> 02:00:13.822]  Waging war on corruption, crashing lives, disinformation.
[02:00:14.682 --> 02:00:19.548]  Thanks for joining us into the third hour of global transmission against tyranny.
[02:00:20.829 --> 02:00:27.437]  Believe me, things will be a lot worse if you and I and others weren't out there fighting the globalists, exposing them for their myriad crimes.
[02:00:28.208 --> 02:00:29.369]  We're now into the third hour.
[02:00:29.429 --> 02:00:31.090]  Just covered a bunch of news on the Bilderberg Group.
[02:00:31.150 --> 02:00:32.211]  More on that coming up.
[02:00:32.271 --> 02:00:36.534]  More on the war on terror, the grisly images of dead U.S.
[02:00:36.554 --> 02:00:38.336]  troops laying around a burning Humvee.
[02:00:39.176 --> 02:00:41.318]  Just a ton of information in this third hour.
[02:00:41.838 --> 02:00:43.380]  Right now, though, let's go to the calls.
[02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:44.981]  Let's talk to Danny in Tennessee.
[02:00:45.021 --> 02:00:45.902]  Danny, you're on the air.
[02:00:45.942 --> 02:00:46.602]  Thanks for holding.
[02:00:46.882 --> 02:00:47.323]  Hey, Alex.
[02:00:47.343 --> 02:00:47.783]  How are you?
[02:00:47.923 --> 02:00:48.303]  Fine, sir.
[02:00:48.864 --> 02:00:53.187]  Hey, I just... Those two articles you just read were just scary.
[02:00:53.227 --> 02:00:54.228]  I mean, you can tell how...
[02:00:55.219 --> 02:01:05.925]  This whole system is being set up to kill people that's not going to take the microchips and kill people who's not going to worship these idiots and shocking articles.
[02:01:10.468 --> 02:01:20.133]  My wife had bought me Wake Up or Waco for our anniversary, and I watched it last night, and that film brought tears to my eyes.
[02:01:20.902 --> 02:01:27.045]  And I wanted to ask if you could put that on Prison Planet TV so I could make CD copies of that and hand it out.
[02:01:27.585 --> 02:01:28.746]  Oh, that's on the website?
[02:01:28.786 --> 02:01:32.868]  Yeah, we'll try to put that up there on the PrisonPlanet.tv for people.
[02:01:33.028 --> 02:01:35.730]  Yeah, that's the only video you've made that's not up there.
[02:01:35.830 --> 02:01:38.551]  I thought it was one of the best ones I've ever seen.
[02:01:39.091 --> 02:01:44.414]  It was good to actually see the Branch Davidians and see that these were normal people.
[02:01:45.003 --> 02:01:45.704]  Loving people.
[02:01:45.724 --> 02:01:51.147]  Well, what that was is Mike Hanson took all these TV shows I'd done and condensed them down.
[02:01:51.167 --> 02:01:52.048]  He did a pretty good job.
[02:01:52.148 --> 02:01:55.930]  And we've actually together, I think, made like three different versions of that.
[02:01:55.950 --> 02:01:58.031]  That's kind of a video that we update as it goes along.
[02:01:58.332 --> 02:01:59.833]  Yeah, it was just incredible.
[02:01:59.953 --> 02:02:11.080]  And, you know, when you were talking about the building burgers, it made me think I had a lady come in my restaurant the other day and I was talking to another customer about the New World Order and, of course, she started calling me a hippie and a kook and
[02:02:11.917 --> 02:02:13.118]  Well, they say it's an effigy.
[02:02:13.138 --> 02:02:14.319]  We don't know they're killing people.
[02:02:14.339 --> 02:02:14.940]  Right, yeah, I mean... And, uh...
[02:02:41.667 --> 02:02:44.869]  Did you say to her, ma'am, you've certainly heard of Skull and Bones?
[02:03:06.889 --> 02:03:10.410]  Right, you know, she was... It was caught on video of them going, Hail Satan!
[02:03:10.450 --> 02:03:11.610]  Sacrifices to you!
[02:03:11.710 --> 02:03:13.490]  And doing mock throat slittings.
[02:03:13.530 --> 02:03:15.311]  That was national TV three years ago.
[02:03:15.571 --> 02:03:20.072]  Right, and that's... You know, she thinks... She's like one of the Rush Limbaugh followers.
[02:03:20.172 --> 02:03:21.952]  Oh, it's just good skull and bones fun.
[02:03:22.492 --> 02:03:23.692]  Just good fraternity fun.
[02:03:23.792 --> 02:03:34.955]  And so I guess Richard Nixon, talking about the orgies in his own presidential tape now released, I guess that too is... I guess that too is liberal propaganda.
[02:03:35.215 --> 02:03:35.855]  Right, it's just...
[02:03:36.730 --> 02:03:37.590]  It's just amazing.
[02:03:37.610 --> 02:03:41.891]  I mean, people, we are so close now to this whole thing unfolding.
[02:03:42.691 --> 02:03:46.372]  And if people do not wake up, I mean, we're just, we're screwed.
[02:03:47.492 --> 02:03:49.012]  I mean, it's every day.
[02:03:49.032 --> 02:03:54.013]  You know, I can remember when I got into this years ago when the Marine Corps asked me if I'd kill Americans and kill patriots.
[02:03:55.274 --> 02:04:00.035]  And you would see articles like this, you know, every few days, a few times a week.
[02:04:00.135 --> 02:04:02.715]  And now it's every single day.
[02:04:03.215 --> 02:04:06.176]  How many years ago was it that the Marine Corps asked you if you'd kill Americans?
[02:04:06.812 --> 02:04:13.335]  This was back in 1998, and I think I talked to you about it on air one time.
[02:04:14.275 --> 02:04:14.855]  They brought me in.
[02:04:14.875 --> 02:04:16.836]  A brigadier general was having a survey.
[02:04:17.856 --> 02:04:19.057]  You want me to wait until after the break?
[02:04:19.077 --> 02:04:22.518]  Yeah, I think people, I mean, this has been in the news, but it's good to hear it directly from somebody.
[02:04:22.558 --> 02:04:25.139]  I mean, you know, will you kill Americans in order to do so?
[02:04:25.159 --> 02:04:29.521]  And if you say no, you get sent overseas, you get given the deadly vaccines.
[02:04:29.541 --> 02:04:34.363]  If you say yes, you get plain clothes, get to sneak around, deal drugs, do everything else.
[02:04:34.583 --> 02:04:34.743]  Yep.
[02:04:35.882 --> 02:04:36.243]  Stay there.
[02:04:36.303 --> 02:04:38.468]  We'll talk about it when we get back, Danny.
[02:04:38.488 --> 02:04:41.173]  Then we'll go to Tony and Rick and Bill and Mech and others.
[02:04:41.935 --> 02:04:43.779]  Infowars.com!
[02:04:46.647 --> 02:04:47.648]  It's finally here.
[02:04:47.788 --> 02:04:48.748]  Spring has arrived.
[02:04:48.949 --> 02:04:51.911]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:04:52.131 --> 02:04:55.593]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:04:55.813 --> 02:05:03.959]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the ARC Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[02:05:04.219 --> 02:05:07.961]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[02:05:08.162 --> 02:05:13.185]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.

[02:05:45.914 --> 02:05:47.455]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:05:47.615 --> 02:05:50.698]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:05:50.838 --> 02:05:54.741]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:05:54.781 --> 02:05:59.025]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:05:59.365 --> 02:06:03.148]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:06:03.228 --> 02:06:05.090]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:06:06.071 --> 02:06:13.356]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:06:13.496 --> 02:06:16.538]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[02:06:16.718 --> 02:06:19.580]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:26.185]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:06:26.485 --> 02:06:27.386]  Go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[02:06:45.357 --> 02:06:45.958]  Hello, folks.
[02:06:46.078 --> 02:06:46.999]  Alex Jones here.
[02:06:47.119 --> 02:06:51.242]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:06:51.362 --> 02:06:54.224]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:06:54.324 --> 02:07:01.030]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:07:01.210 --> 02:07:04.232]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:07:04.432 --> 02:07:06.814]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:07:06.954 --> 02:07:11.658]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[02:07:11.838 --> 02:07:17.122]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[02:07:17.303 --> 02:07:18.043]  MTBE.
[02:07:18.263 --> 02:07:19.064]  Radon-222.
[02:07:19.184 --> 02:07:21.166]  Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur.
[02:07:21.306 --> 02:07:22.147]  Even nitrates.
[02:07:22.427 --> 02:07:26.430]  And unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[02:07:26.570 --> 02:07:33.256]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[02:07:36.398 --> 02:07:37.499]  803-4438.
[02:07:37.539 --> 02:07:38.580]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:07:39.301 --> 02:07:43.225]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:07:50.632 --> 02:07:51.293]  Big Brother.
[02:07:51.933 --> 02:07:53.015]  Mainstream media.
[02:07:53.695 --> 02:07:54.856]  Government cover-ups.
[02:07:55.477 --> 02:07:56.238]  You want answers?
[02:07:57.029 --> 02:07:57.909]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:57.929 --> 02:08:02.511]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:02.771 --> 02:08:06.892]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:07.093 --> 02:08:13.955]  Eight minutes, 45 seconds into the third hour of global transmission.
[02:08:15.355 --> 02:08:22.138]  In my film, Police State 2000, made in 1999, we show Marines from Maryland to California.
[02:08:23.718 --> 02:08:25.359]  The Army from Texas...
[02:08:26.610 --> 02:08:27.251]  To St.
[02:08:27.331 --> 02:08:39.680]  Louis, running urban warfare training drills, covertly leasing buildings, blowing them up in the dead of night, next door to nursing homes, foreign troops running around screaming, black helicopters swarming.
[02:08:39.700 --> 02:08:42.462]  I mean, it's video, newscast, interviews, news articles.
[02:08:43.723 --> 02:08:47.046]  And then we show the Marines trying to confiscate our guns here domestically.
[02:08:47.286 --> 02:08:49.428]  I mean, it's not a conspiracy theory, it's fact.
[02:08:50.180 --> 02:08:54.624]  And now we're hearing the generals say, yeah, we may have to do this because the terrorists hit us.
[02:08:55.145 --> 02:08:56.826]  But they set it all up beforehand.
[02:08:56.846 --> 02:08:58.328]  This is all part of a larger program.
[02:08:59.729 --> 02:09:04.093]  And back in the early 90s, we all heard about the 29 Palms survey, but that wasn't even an official survey.
[02:09:04.133 --> 02:09:07.916]  Will you fire on Americans under Presidential Decision Directive 25?
[02:09:09.418 --> 02:09:13.602]  Since then, there have been countless surveys and questionnaires that have been public on this.
[02:09:15.416 --> 02:09:16.857]  And they give them all these scenarios.
[02:09:16.897 --> 02:09:20.479]  You know, there's a terror attack, or there's a bio-release, and people are riding with guns.
[02:09:20.499 --> 02:09:21.419]  Will you fire on them?
[02:09:21.700 --> 02:09:22.840]  Will you put them in camps?
[02:09:24.241 --> 02:09:28.183]  And the government has to get the troops to say yes so they can move ahead.
[02:09:28.863 --> 02:09:30.985]  And in the past, most of them have said no.
[02:09:31.085 --> 02:09:32.706]  Now I'm hearing those numbers are getting worse.
[02:09:33.486 --> 02:09:42.531]  In the past, it was 70-plus percent that said no, but then they would just take the 20 percent that said yes and promote them and move them into positions of power and keep them here domestically.
[02:09:43.553 --> 02:09:50.236]  And then the Wall Street Journal a few months ago reported that at UT you have an anti-war rally.
[02:09:50.256 --> 02:09:58.661]  You know, these secret police, these military army intelligence officers harass you and go to the dean and try to get videos of it.
[02:09:58.961 --> 02:10:01.142]  And we have troops in suits.
[02:10:02.023 --> 02:10:07.246]  Or, you know, they've got long hair and earrings, and they're all over the place, driving around in their black vehicles, machine guns.
[02:10:07.747 --> 02:10:15.972]  The really criminal ones who they test out are shipping narcotics around and videotaping, you know, the mayors with their prostitutes.
[02:10:16.072 --> 02:10:20.235]  I mean, it's sinister, KGB-style stuff going on.
[02:10:20.895 --> 02:10:26.579]  And then whole other blocks of troops are involved in surveillance with their helicopters, and they've now got drones in the skies.
[02:10:26.899 --> 02:10:27.960]  It's all part of your new freedom.
[02:10:29.395 --> 02:10:31.836]  But going back to Danny, real quick, finish up, Danny.
[02:10:32.216 --> 02:10:34.037]  Tell folks about, will you fire on Americans?
[02:10:36.517 --> 02:10:37.158]  Are you there, Danny?
[02:10:37.398 --> 02:10:37.938]  Yeah, I'm still here.
[02:10:37.958 --> 02:10:38.458]  Can you hear me?
[02:10:38.498 --> 02:10:43.999]  Yeah, just in a nutshell, tell people that story of how you were in the Marine Corps in the late 1990s, what they said to you.
[02:10:44.340 --> 02:10:48.741]  Well, what had happened, I was in a real bad wreck over in Japan, and I just splattered my body.
[02:10:48.781 --> 02:10:49.801]  I can barely walk now.
[02:10:50.461 --> 02:10:52.462]  And I transferred back to Camp Lejeune.
[02:10:53.664 --> 02:10:59.809]  And my officer, the guy I worked for, he told me that I needed to go up to division headquarters and take a survey.
[02:11:00.450 --> 02:11:02.892]  And I asked him, I said, well, sir, what's it about?
[02:11:02.912 --> 02:11:03.772]  And he said, I don't know.
[02:11:03.793 --> 02:11:10.438]  And at the time, I was getting out on a medical discharge, so I figured it just had something to do with the whole medical program.
[02:11:10.458 --> 02:11:14.882]  Yeah, see, now that you were injured, they would have used you as an intelligence officer domestically, but go ahead.
[02:11:15.102 --> 02:11:20.446]  Yeah, what happened was I went up there, and it was a female brigadier general.
[02:11:21.167 --> 02:11:22.528]  She was the one over at the survey.
[02:11:23.610 --> 02:11:25.771]  And they brought me in and had all these weird questions.
[02:11:25.791 --> 02:11:39.135]  And then Pager finally asked me, he said, if martial law was declared in America and you had to go door to door to take guns from Americans, would you be willing to use deadly force on Americans that would give up their guns?
[02:11:39.155 --> 02:11:41.895]  And I said, sir, I said, no way.
[02:11:41.955 --> 02:11:44.476]  I said, I'd kill the officer that gave me that order, though.
[02:11:45.236 --> 02:11:47.377]  And we were all just, I mean, just outraged.
[02:11:48.351 --> 02:11:51.753]  About the entire thing, and this was a pretty widespread thing.
[02:11:51.773 --> 02:11:55.814]  I think they were doing it all over the Marine Corps, and then I'm hearing reports it's going on in the Army also.
[02:11:57.255 --> 02:12:02.257]  And that's what really got me thinking, and then seeing all the rider trucks in the Marine Corps.
[02:12:03.177 --> 02:12:11.561]  And I was in during the time when General Kulak was commandant, and his big thing was urban warfare, urban warfare, and that's when we were invading cities and stuff.
[02:12:12.481 --> 02:12:16.043]  And I saw posters back then, one of their urban warfare things was
[02:12:16.607 --> 02:12:20.128]  A green dragon rising out of the New York Harbor and eating the World Trade Center.
[02:12:20.608 --> 02:12:23.629]  Yeah, that's actually in Police State 2000.
[02:12:23.849 --> 02:12:25.330]  Yeah, and that's one of the things.
[02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:28.231]  I said, good grief, what's going on in this country?
[02:12:29.071 --> 02:12:31.312]  And then once I got out of the Marine Corps, that's when I started.
[02:12:32.192 --> 02:12:38.474]  I can barely walk, so I spent about 10 hours a day researching the New World Order and Satanism and everything that's going on.
[02:12:38.534 --> 02:12:40.635]  Of course, it just blew my mind.
[02:12:40.675 --> 02:12:44.896]  And then I found you and watched all your videos, and that opened my eyes that much more.
[02:12:46.034 --> 02:12:47.115]  People have caught away.
[02:12:47.795 --> 02:12:52.837]  When they're asking Marines, hey, will you kill American citizens?
[02:12:52.877 --> 02:12:54.458]  Half these guys are brainwashed.
[02:12:55.138 --> 02:12:56.199]  I hear you, Danny.
[02:12:56.239 --> 02:12:57.399]  Great points.
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:03.222]  I wish you'd set up a video camera on yourself and tell your story and mail it to me.
[02:13:03.262 --> 02:13:13.367]  I'd air it on local television and just have a video shot of about from your chest up to your head in a quiet room and just have the camera about two feet from you and tell your story.
[02:13:14.153 --> 02:13:15.334]  And I'd put it on TV locally.
[02:13:15.354 --> 02:13:21.497]  In fact, I have Marines and people, military people, in police state videos.
[02:13:21.637 --> 02:13:22.918]  In Road to Tyranny, I have that.
[02:13:24.118 --> 02:13:31.662]  There was this Marine Corps officer who was then a police officer, now owns a computer company here in town in the late 1980s.
[02:13:31.802 --> 02:13:33.863]  He had photos of this, all the stuff.
[02:13:33.883 --> 02:13:37.846]  Of course, I couldn't show all that because it would tell people who he was.
[02:13:38.506 --> 02:13:42.408]  But in the late 1980s, he was in Virginia.
[02:13:44.016 --> 02:13:45.557]  I said, oh, you're writing drug dealers.
[02:13:45.637 --> 02:13:47.478]  No, no, no, gun dealers, people's homes.
[02:13:48.278 --> 02:13:54.740]  And the Marines would dress up in these police jackets and kick in doors and go in with their MP5s.
[02:13:55.361 --> 02:13:57.301]  And that was when he was still in the Marine Corps.
[02:13:58.022 --> 02:14:05.744]  And I remember two weeks ago I had Sergeant Massey on, who had been in the Associated Press talking about how they'd mow down women and children.
[02:14:07.445 --> 02:14:09.746]  And he was on the show, and he talked about as soon as he got back,
[02:14:10.992 --> 02:14:13.893]  He's having flashbacks of all his children dying in his arms.
[02:14:13.933 --> 02:14:16.154]  He gets a call from the sheriff, oh, I want to hire you.
[02:14:16.835 --> 02:14:18.195]  There's this liaison.
[02:14:19.456 --> 02:14:23.778]  And a lot of these guys don't have a conscience like Danny or like Sergeant Massey.
[02:14:24.778 --> 02:14:25.278]  They love it.
[02:14:25.619 --> 02:14:28.360]  And they're going to be pulling you and your wife over, your daughter over.
[02:14:29.480 --> 02:14:32.242]  And so they're building the cadres right now.
[02:14:33.582 --> 02:14:38.044]  And top generals are now spouting off about how good martial law is.
[02:14:38.164 --> 02:14:40.005]  So we're in serious trouble.
[02:14:41.112 --> 02:14:43.614]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tony in Colorado.
[02:14:43.654 --> 02:14:44.414]  Tony, thanks for holding.
[02:14:44.454 --> 02:14:44.754]  Go ahead.
[02:14:44.774 --> 02:14:45.795]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:14:45.815 --> 02:14:56.501]  Two-fold question, kind of digressing from your current topic, but one being what's your thoughts on the real estate market collapsing and also the Wall Street collapsing?
[02:14:58.223 --> 02:15:02.967]  Well, that's a complex question, but obviously the Federal Reserve's been printing money like it's going out of style.
[02:15:03.007 --> 02:15:08.192]  The dollar's been devalued by 40-plus percent, fluctuates between 42 and 46 percent.
[02:15:08.692 --> 02:15:13.276]  And again, somebody in Mexico knows what it means to have a bad peso, but the average yuppie thinks it's good.
[02:15:13.376 --> 02:15:14.577]  Oh, great, Bush said it's good.
[02:15:14.597 --> 02:15:16.779]  You know, hamburger jobs are manufacturing.
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:19.962]  So it's all this la-la land statistics.
[02:15:20.899 --> 02:15:24.141]  They're telling us how great things are, but housing's going flat.
[02:15:24.601 --> 02:15:26.462]  A lot of key economic numbers are in trouble.
[02:15:26.883 --> 02:15:28.624]  They claim, oh, there's more job hiring.
[02:15:28.644 --> 02:15:33.006]  Well, that's because more people are going off the unemployment rolls, so they're not counted as unemployed.
[02:15:33.947 --> 02:15:38.069]  So I don't know what's going to happen, but I know that it's very, very serious.
[02:15:39.050 --> 02:15:39.170]  Okay.
[02:15:39.190 --> 02:15:40.230]  All right, thank you.
[02:15:40.570 --> 02:15:41.071]  Anything else?
[02:15:41.331 --> 02:15:41.771]  No, that's it.
[02:15:41.911 --> 02:15:42.992]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[02:15:43.792 --> 02:15:45.873]  Let's talk to Rich in New York.
[02:15:45.893 --> 02:15:46.174]  Go ahead.
[02:15:46.194 --> 02:15:46.734]  You're on the air.
[02:15:47.134 --> 02:15:47.895]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:15:48.255 --> 02:15:48.475]  Fine.
[02:15:48.931 --> 02:15:51.492]  Okay, I just want to mention a few things real quick.
[02:15:51.912 --> 02:15:56.775]  Chuck Baldwin was tapped as the vice presidential candidate for the Constitution Party.
[02:15:56.815 --> 02:15:58.796]  Yeah, he's a real Christian conservative.
[02:15:59.056 --> 02:15:59.576]  He's excellent.
[02:15:59.616 --> 02:16:00.677]  I love his report.
[02:16:01.817 --> 02:16:03.718]  We carry them at Prison Planet, by the way.
[02:16:04.098 --> 02:16:04.358]  Right.
[02:16:04.839 --> 02:16:11.862]  And also, I just want to mention about the Stop the FTAA thing run by the John Birch Society.
[02:16:12.709 --> 02:16:13.890]  To activate Congress.
[02:16:14.350 --> 02:16:19.412]  Stop the free trade area of the Americas, which is the EU of America, the Pan-American Union.
[02:16:19.912 --> 02:16:20.152]  Right.
[02:16:20.632 --> 02:16:25.655]  And, you know, the bad thing about it, of course, is that it's going to outsource the rest of our jobs to other countries.
[02:16:25.675 --> 02:16:37.980]  The Congressional Budget Office says that the high-tech layoffs alone in the next five years, by 2007, will be eight times worse, no, no, seven times worse than what they are now.
[02:16:38.689 --> 02:16:38.889]  Right.
[02:16:39.169 --> 02:16:43.470]  And Bush says exporting jobs, as it was last year, is our main export.
[02:16:43.650 --> 02:16:44.390]  That it's good.
[02:16:46.170 --> 02:16:49.671]  The same week he said that hamburger jobs are manufacturing.
[02:16:51.891 --> 02:16:52.051]  Yep.
[02:16:52.391 --> 02:16:53.172]  No, you didn't hear that?
[02:16:53.192 --> 02:16:54.032]  Oh, I heard that.
[02:16:54.092 --> 02:16:54.612]  It was all over the news.
[02:16:54.632 --> 02:16:55.772]  It was all over the news for a long time.
[02:16:56.152 --> 02:16:58.732]  How good it is and how we have all these new industry jobs.
[02:16:58.772 --> 02:16:59.013]  Yes.
[02:17:00.053 --> 02:17:06.994]  So, I guess people can go to www.jbs.org and click on the...
[02:17:07.924 --> 02:17:08.345]  We're good to go.
[02:17:27.734 --> 02:17:38.718]  Most of the people I talk to, I'm pretty close to my family, but friends of mine, I have a couple of friends who are more liberal than they are conservative, I mean, in terms of like, they voted for Ralph Nader in the last election.
[02:17:39.038 --> 02:17:50.043]  But they have an open ear in terms of, you know, different ideas of what happened and stuff, you know, I discuss it with them, but, you know, I do the best I can, but most people, I don't know, I've got a negative viewpoint from New York, I guess.
[02:17:52.384 --> 02:17:53.324]  Well, that's interesting.
[02:17:53.344 --> 02:17:54.024]  That's too bad.
[02:17:55.085 --> 02:17:55.605]  Anything else?
[02:17:56.417 --> 02:17:58.699]  Well, we have, you know, look at our senators.
[02:17:58.759 --> 02:18:04.024]  I mean, we've got Schumer, who's a, you know, forget it, in terms of gun grabbing, and Hillary, you know?
[02:18:04.044 --> 02:18:05.926]  I mean, that speaks volumes right there.
[02:18:07.147 --> 02:18:07.607]  Absolutely.
[02:18:07.627 --> 02:18:08.348]  Thanks for the call.
[02:18:09.149 --> 02:18:10.050]  Bill in Ohio.
[02:18:10.110 --> 02:18:10.850]  Bill, go ahead.
[02:18:10.870 --> 02:18:11.711]  How you doing?
[02:18:11.991 --> 02:18:12.212]  Good.
[02:18:12.732 --> 02:18:16.175]  Listen, something you've been saying I wanted to ask about.
[02:18:16.195 --> 02:18:17.877]  You said they're going to start trying to...
[02:18:20.191 --> 02:18:22.953]  I do a background check on people for any kind of transactions.
[02:18:23.074 --> 02:18:25.876]  Well, they've been doing it for 10 years, but now it's going to be everything.
[02:18:26.056 --> 02:18:30.320]  Well, I was going to say, how would that work for a cash transaction?
[02:18:30.981 --> 02:18:36.826]  I can understand, you know, if you go in to buy a car or to get a loan for a house or something.
[02:18:37.166 --> 02:18:38.087]  That I can understand.
[02:18:38.147 --> 02:18:40.069]  No, no, they're not just running a background check for the loan.
[02:18:40.109 --> 02:18:44.733]  They're running you through the government databases to track and trace what you're up to.
[02:18:45.413 --> 02:18:47.255]  Let me tell you how it's going to work.
[02:18:47.625 --> 02:18:49.927]  I mean, how could they do it if it's a cash transaction?
[02:18:49.947 --> 02:18:50.547]  Let me tell you how.
[02:18:50.567 --> 02:18:51.268]  It's going to walk out.
[02:18:51.428 --> 02:18:52.809]  Do you want me to answer the question?
[02:18:52.829 --> 02:18:53.990]  Sure.
[02:18:54.771 --> 02:19:09.143]  In the next couple of years, the so-called conservatives are going to say, we've got a new national sales tax, we're going to cut the income tax, and so even if you pay cash, you're going to have to swipe your card or enter your social security number because we can't have the poor paying sales tax.
[02:19:09.543 --> 02:19:12.546]  We have to make sure you're not cheating, though, so it's going to be a...
[02:19:14.418 --> 02:19:20.861]  It's going to be a sliding scale for how much money you make, how much sales tax you make, and so that's going to be the point of sales scan.
[02:19:22.082 --> 02:19:24.063]  Hmm.
[02:19:24.383 --> 02:19:25.864]  Has there been anything published?
[02:19:26.424 --> 02:19:28.065]  Oh, yeah, a lot of stuff, yeah.
[02:19:29.846 --> 02:19:31.227]  Do you have some out on the website?
[02:19:31.527 --> 02:19:32.307]  We certainly do.
[02:19:32.367 --> 02:19:33.288]  Yes, we do post that.
[02:19:34.028 --> 02:19:34.248]  Thank you.
[02:19:34.628 --> 02:19:35.028]  Thank you.
[02:19:35.089 --> 02:19:35.929]  It's a very good question.
[02:19:36.907 --> 02:19:41.131]  But understand, with a face-scanning camera, they don't need you to swipe a card.
[02:19:41.451 --> 02:19:44.334]  Because when you've got your driver's license or ID card, they face-scan you.
[02:19:46.309 --> 02:19:57.035]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:19:57.215 --> 02:20:04.760]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:20:05.040 --> 02:20:08.202]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:20:08.322 --> 02:20:08.782]  We're good to go.
[02:20:27.017 --> 02:20:32.961]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:20:33.182 --> 02:20:37.145]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:20:37.165 --> 02:20:37.725]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:20:48.490 --> 02:20:53.974]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:20:54.394 --> 02:20:58.617]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:20:58.857 --> 02:21:05.902]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:21:06.283 --> 02:21:12.387]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:21:12.527 --> 02:21:13.728]  There are no side effects.
[02:21:13.948 --> 02:21:14.409]  We're good to go.
[02:21:14.449 --> 02:21:14.929]  We're good to go.
[02:21:30.863 --> 02:21:33.987]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.

[02:21:35.309 --> 02:21:35.509]  Call today.
[02:21:45.982 --> 02:21:50.686]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[02:21:50.926 --> 02:21:54.349]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[02:21:54.570 --> 02:21:57.052]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[02:21:57.292 --> 02:22:05.880]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[02:22:06.240 --> 02:22:12.025]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[02:22:12.285 --> 02:22:14.247]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[02:22:14.487 --> 02:22:21.414]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.
[02:22:21.754 --> 02:22:28.220]  Midas Resources is pleased to offer a subscription to the International Forecaster newsletter free of charge with a qualifying order.
[02:22:28.500 --> 02:22:28.981]  That's right.
[02:22:29.061 --> 02:22:35.827]  For a limited time, Midas Resources is offering a one-year subscription to Bob Chapman's powerful newsletter, the International Forecaster.
[02:22:36.067 --> 02:22:40.528]  Call 800-686-2237 for more information or to place your order.
[02:22:40.608 --> 02:22:41.328]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:41.568 --> 02:22:45.449]  Call today and avoid getting soaked tomorrow.
[02:22:45.849 --> 02:22:49.550]  The grass is always greener with a wheatgrass kit from wheatgrasskits.com.
[02:22:49.670 --> 02:22:53.051]  Their mission is to provide you with nature's most perfect living food.
[02:22:53.071 --> 02:22:55.412]  Skip the high prices at the neighborhood juice bar.
[02:22:55.572 --> 02:22:59.693]  Grow your own wheatgrass, barley grass, sunflower greens, sprouts, or herbs.
[02:23:01.094 --> 02:23:02.954]  It's easy to do indoors or out.
[02:23:03.214 --> 02:23:04.635]  Start with a basic wheatgrass kit.
[02:23:04.835 --> 02:23:08.256]  It's everything you'll need to grow stamina-building, nutrient-rich wheatgrass.
[02:23:08.516 --> 02:23:16.680]  The kit includes 5 pounds of organic wheatgrass seed, reusable growing trays, organic soil, mineral additive, and the book, Wheatgrass, Nature's Finest Miracle.
[02:23:16.900 --> 02:23:20.281]  Or get the deluxe kit that adds barley, grass seed, and sunflower greens.
[02:23:20.561 --> 02:23:25.463]  The health benefits of wheatgrass are legendary, but perhaps one of the best benefits are the antioxidants.
[02:23:25.743 --> 02:23:26.224]  We're good to go.
[02:23:26.244 --> 02:23:26.424]  I think?
[02:23:53.868 --> 02:23:56.710]  All right, I'm going to take a few more calls, then we're going to break.
[02:23:56.730 --> 02:23:59.973]  I'm going to come back with some of the Big Brother tracking systems in your car.
[02:24:01.574 --> 02:24:08.039]  Then we'll get into some more developments in Iraq and how they've put in a puppet dictatorship.
[02:24:08.080 --> 02:24:10.261]  I saw an editorial cartoon, Bush giving a speech.
[02:24:10.722 --> 02:24:12.203]  You know, the Iraq government is not...
[02:24:12.901 --> 02:24:13.381]  Puppets?
[02:24:13.421 --> 02:24:14.642]  They're actually Muppets.
[02:24:16.483 --> 02:24:17.244]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[02:24:17.984 --> 02:24:20.566]  Also, some of the reasons why Tenet may have resigned.
[02:24:20.766 --> 02:24:23.027]  Tenet resigns as CIA director.
[02:24:23.768 --> 02:24:26.229]  Three harsh reports on agency due out.
[02:24:26.849 --> 02:24:28.831]  So he's kind of the sacrificial lamb.
[02:24:29.751 --> 02:24:34.314]  And an interesting article about a yearbook containing anti-Semitic messages and what they did.
[02:24:35.413 --> 02:24:39.655]  What they did because of this, the very interesting precedent being set here.
[02:24:40.296 --> 02:24:42.076]  Right now, Mick in Arizona.
[02:24:42.136 --> 02:24:42.957]  Mick, you're on the air.
[02:24:43.017 --> 02:24:43.477]  Go ahead.
[02:24:43.757 --> 02:24:44.218]  Hey, Alex.
[02:24:44.598 --> 02:24:44.938]  Hello.
[02:24:45.438 --> 02:24:54.803]  On that depleted uranium, the government did a study and they found a supplement that actually is very effective against radiation poisoning called beta-glucan.
[02:24:55.183 --> 02:24:58.685]  Nancy Corky's got the little spin-off of the study.
[02:24:59.265 --> 02:25:02.287]  They should be handing out candy in the VA house, but they're not.
[02:25:02.527 --> 02:25:02.767]  The only...
[02:25:08.508 --> 02:25:11.174]  Well, you know, we've interviewed several of the top scientists.
[02:25:11.194 --> 02:25:14.681]  The man who wrote the book on the putty uranium for the Pentagon, literally wrote the book.
[02:25:15.644 --> 02:25:18.625]  It was there studying it for them, and they know it's killing the troops.
[02:25:18.705 --> 02:25:20.306]  Thousands and thousands have died from it.
[02:25:20.626 --> 02:25:27.449]  Tens of thousands are sick, and they've used at least ten times the amount in the second Gulf War they used in the first Gulf War.
[02:25:27.989 --> 02:25:30.210]  And this time it's not out in the middle of the desert they used it.
[02:25:30.270 --> 02:25:31.390]  It's in all the big cities.
[02:25:31.750 --> 02:25:35.311]  And now our troops have taken over the bases that were bombarded with this stuff.
[02:25:35.351 --> 02:25:36.392]  It's very, very serious.
[02:25:37.352 --> 02:25:38.032]  Very serious.
[02:25:38.273 --> 02:25:41.734]  But that just shows what the government thinks of the people they're asking to go after the citizens.
[02:25:42.494 --> 02:25:44.635]  I know for a fact that's what they think of us.
[02:25:45.049 --> 02:25:52.652]  Hey, uh, on the police, it's almost like all those horror stories about the police, it's almost like they've been taken over by a vampire cult and wanting to take your blood in.
[02:25:53.152 --> 02:25:55.053]  Oh, yeah, that's in Arizona.
[02:25:55.073 --> 02:25:57.753]  They pull you over and take your blood on the side of the road, yeah.
[02:25:57.834 --> 02:26:00.574]  There's no taser in the back of the head if you don't!
[02:26:01.975 --> 02:26:05.816]  That's right, they beat that guy to death who wouldn't give him blood, yeah.
[02:26:05.956 --> 02:26:12.139]  George Norrie had this guy, William Bramley, on who did an expose, a book called God's Beaten.
[02:26:12.419 --> 02:26:13.359]  He researched...
[02:26:13.985 --> 02:26:14.425]  I hear you.
[02:26:14.746 --> 02:26:17.408]  Your phone's kind of breaking up.
[02:26:17.428 --> 02:26:18.769]  Thanks for the call, sir.
[02:26:19.029 --> 02:26:19.749]  Let's talk to Carl.
[02:26:19.769 --> 02:26:20.910]  Carl, where are you calling us from?
[02:26:20.930 --> 02:26:21.811]  Calling from Virginia.
[02:26:22.391 --> 02:26:24.633]  First-time caller, long-time listener.
[02:26:24.713 --> 02:26:25.013]  Welcome.
[02:26:42.987 --> 02:26:43.648]  Thank you, sir.
[02:26:43.748 --> 02:26:48.951]  Great job you're doing there, and keep it up, and I hope that you get a lot more stations carrying your program.
[02:26:49.052 --> 02:26:49.592]  Well, thank you.
[02:26:49.952 --> 02:26:56.797]  I was scanning the shortwave frequencies this morning with an ICR-75 and came across a frequency of 17.494.
[02:26:58.478 --> 02:27:06.324]  I had the call letters of this station, and it was broadcasting a message that the U.S.
[02:27:07.385 --> 02:27:11.408]  Navy is taking their vessels away
[02:27:11.875 --> 02:27:16.258]  Out at sea, anticipating something big to occur.
[02:27:16.278 --> 02:27:18.359]  Have you heard anything on this?
[02:27:18.619 --> 02:27:26.144]  Yeah, that's actually been in a bunch of the foreign papers, and even our own, that massive fleets worldwide are being launched right now.
[02:27:26.784 --> 02:27:28.905]  Well, I'm going to hang up and let you take another call.
[02:27:28.925 --> 02:27:30.947]  Could you give me a little more info on that, Alex?
[02:27:31.207 --> 02:27:37.971]  Yeah, again, I think it was back on Tuesday or so we mentioned some of this, and I've seen the articles that there's a lot of big...
[02:27:38.618 --> 02:27:40.459]  You know, the Russians are doing naval drills.
[02:27:40.479 --> 02:27:41.539]  Our government is.
[02:27:42.179 --> 02:27:43.479]  The Chinese are.
[02:27:43.599 --> 02:27:44.660]  The Japanese.
[02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:45.900]  The North Koreans.
[02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:48.101]  The Europeans are.
[02:27:48.521 --> 02:27:49.461]  NATO is.
[02:27:50.442 --> 02:27:55.383]  And they've got the big G8 summit coming up next week.
[02:27:55.443 --> 02:27:58.284]  No protest allowed in Georgia, folks, in six counties.
[02:27:58.764 --> 02:28:00.725]  It's just a preemptive state of emergency.
[02:28:01.105 --> 02:28:03.185]  No protest allowed of Bush in Paris.
[02:28:04.146 --> 02:28:05.226]  And that was in Reuters.
[02:28:06.443 --> 02:28:09.684]  Yesterday, when he goes to Paris this weekend.
[02:28:09.784 --> 02:28:12.465]  So, a lot of weird stuff going on.
[02:28:12.485 --> 02:28:15.566]  But again, this could all just be drilling for Marshall Law.
[02:28:15.586 --> 02:28:15.826]  I don't know.
[02:28:15.846 --> 02:28:17.767]  They're about to throttle it into gear next week.
[02:28:19.768 --> 02:28:21.228]  Does that answer your question, Carl?
[02:28:21.568 --> 02:28:22.969]  Yes, it did, Alex.
[02:28:23.069 --> 02:28:24.209]  I do appreciate it.
[02:28:24.389 --> 02:28:32.932]  And I also heard something from this broadcast on that frequency stating something about a comet coming close to the planet.
[02:28:33.332 --> 02:28:33.652]  Yeah.
[02:28:33.692 --> 02:28:35.393]  Soho and all this mumbo-jumbo.
[02:28:35.593 --> 02:28:35.713]  Mm-hmm.
[02:28:36.331 --> 02:28:40.414]  Yeah, we got a call about that in the first hour, and again, that's the classic stuff we hear.
[02:28:40.434 --> 02:28:49.961]  You know, there's some meteorites or space junk blew up over the Pacific Northwest, and that story is confirmed and admitted by NASA.
[02:28:50.461 --> 02:28:50.701]  Right.
[02:28:51.402 --> 02:28:54.044]  But then somebody called in with a fake radio report.
[02:28:55.029 --> 02:29:00.971]  On a big Seattle news station, this was in the AP last night, saying they were a scientist and they'd gone to the meteor site.
[02:29:01.331 --> 02:29:02.511]  That turned out to be false.
[02:29:02.551 --> 02:29:07.333]  And then it's this reoccurring urban legend of these comets and Planet Xs that'll kill us.
[02:29:08.193 --> 02:29:14.555]  And the people espousing it, you know, a year from now will say it's about to kill us again.
[02:29:15.496 --> 02:29:18.897]  And a lot of that is the government has put out this story, put out this idea.
[02:29:19.497 --> 02:29:22.818]  And notice we've got the day after out right now kind of creating the fear as well.
[02:29:24.116 --> 02:29:25.097]  Okay, thanks, Alex.
[02:29:25.117 --> 02:29:25.957]  Keep up the good work, man.
[02:29:26.137 --> 02:29:26.498]  Thank you.
[02:29:26.538 --> 02:29:27.818]  I appreciate it.
[02:29:28.639 --> 02:29:30.000]  Always something to distract.
[02:29:30.060 --> 02:29:32.061]  And I'm not saying people shouldn't report on this.
[02:29:32.301 --> 02:29:33.062]  You can't confirm it.
[02:29:33.102 --> 02:29:33.762]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:36.424 --> 02:29:37.364]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.825 --> 02:29:39.426]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:40.346 --> 02:29:43.128]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:46.410 --> 02:29:47.951]  Is the air you breathe killing you?
[02:29:48.641 --> 02:29:48.961]  What?
[02:29:49.041 --> 02:29:55.224]  The Environmental Protection Agency studies state that indoor air is up to 70 times more polluted than outdoor city air.
[02:29:55.545 --> 02:29:57.406]  Even Oprah addressed this concern on her show.
[02:29:57.726 --> 02:29:58.206]  Heard enough?
[02:29:58.806 --> 02:29:59.447]  Sure have.
[02:29:59.707 --> 02:30:01.228]  How can I purify my air?
[02:30:01.488 --> 02:30:01.748]  Easy.

[02:33:15.048 --> 02:33:15.108]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:15.128 --> 02:33:18.268]  As you know, George Tenet, the gangster, the kingpin, the mac daddy,
[02:33:30.012 --> 02:33:31.292]  Resigned yesterday morning.
[02:33:31.352 --> 02:33:32.633]  Lord Bush made the announcement.
[02:33:33.193 --> 02:33:34.994]  Tennant resigns as CIA Director.
[02:33:35.034 --> 02:33:36.874]  Three harsh reports on agency due.
[02:33:36.894 --> 02:33:38.115]  This is out of the New York Times.
[02:33:38.655 --> 02:33:45.817]  George J. Tennant, the besieged Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, presided over a major expansion of American spy agencies.
[02:33:45.917 --> 02:33:46.317]  Oh, yes.
[02:33:46.757 --> 02:33:48.738]  But also critical intelligence failures.
[02:33:48.878 --> 02:33:49.798]  They were great successes.
[02:33:50.398 --> 02:33:52.539]  Abruptly resigned Thursday.
[02:33:53.334 --> 02:34:17.539]  Both Mr. Tenet and President Bush said their resignation was for personal reasons, but current and former intelligence officials noted that Mr. Tenet was anticipating heavy criticism from three reports expected to assail the agency either over its failure to detect the September 11, 2001 attacks, that'll be the whitewash report, terror plot, or the assessments that Iraq possessed unconventional weapons before the American invasion last year.
[02:34:18.351 --> 02:34:25.072]  Most damaging among them is the Senate Intelligence Committee report due this month, which is expected to single out errors.
[02:34:26.293 --> 02:34:26.833]  No, folks.
[02:34:26.853 --> 02:34:28.453]  The war on drugs is a great success.
[02:34:28.513 --> 02:34:30.514]  Triple the heroin, double the cocaine, more people in prison.
[02:34:30.794 --> 02:34:32.134]  The war on terror is a great success.
[02:34:32.174 --> 02:34:33.094]  They control the terrorists.
[02:34:33.354 --> 02:34:35.294]  They scare us into accepting tyranny.
[02:34:35.314 --> 02:34:36.475]  It's a great success for them.
[02:34:37.775 --> 02:34:38.295]  Look at it that way.
[02:34:38.795 --> 02:34:46.517]  Most damaging among them is the Senate Intelligence Committee report due this month, which is expected to single out errors made by the agency in its pre-war judgments.
[02:34:46.737 --> 02:34:47.117]  You mean it's
[02:34:47.831 --> 02:34:53.758]  Planting of fake news articles, fake letters from troops with fake signatures.
[02:34:53.798 --> 02:34:54.379]  You mean those?
[02:34:54.679 --> 02:34:58.023]  You mean running to known declared weapon sites and declaring that they were new?
[02:34:58.083 --> 02:34:58.584]  You mean that?
[02:34:59.766 --> 02:35:03.510]  You mean hiring Jerry Bruckheimer to produce the Saving Private Lynch report?
[02:35:03.570 --> 02:35:04.051]  I mean, come on.
[02:35:04.792 --> 02:35:06.574]  Some Republican senators, including Pat...
[02:35:07.268 --> 02:35:18.155]  Roberts of Kansas, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, signaled to the administration in the past few weeks that the report conclusions would be so critical that it would raise questions about who should be held accountable, an official said.
[02:35:18.535 --> 02:35:22.698]  Another official said the highly critical nature of the report was widely known at the White House.
[02:35:23.337 --> 02:35:29.440]  Mr. Tenet is to be replaced by his deputy, John McLaughlin, who will serve as acting director.
[02:35:29.540 --> 02:35:32.322]  Mr. Bush is unlikely to nominate a permanent successor.
[02:35:32.782 --> 02:35:40.787]  Before the November election, Republicans said because of confirmation battle this summer would attract more attention to the agency's assessments of Saddam Hussein's weapons.
[02:35:44.642 --> 02:35:45.843]  Resignation at the CIA.
[02:35:45.883 --> 02:35:55.668]  A senior intelligence official said Thursday evening that James Pavitt, the head of the agency's clandestine service, is to announce Friday that he is retiring.
[02:35:56.128 --> 02:36:06.293]  The retirement of Mr. Pavitt, a CIA veteran, whose current title as Deputy Director of Operations had been planned for some time, and nothing to do with Mr. Tennant's resignation, the agency official said.
[02:36:08.414 --> 02:36:09.355]  And it goes on and on.
[02:36:11.235 --> 02:36:14.356]  Continuing here, this is from CBS News.
[02:36:15.436 --> 02:36:21.778]  And the new appointed leader of Iraq, appointed by our government, says he wants our government to stay.
[02:36:21.798 --> 02:36:23.759]  See, that's the oxymoron.
[02:36:23.779 --> 02:36:28.381]  You know, I go appoint somebody as your ruler, and then I go, oh, this is freedom.
[02:36:28.481 --> 02:36:31.381]  See, the ruler says they want me to stay.
[02:36:32.002 --> 02:36:33.342]  Why, this is democracy.
[02:36:33.982 --> 02:36:34.583]  I mean, what?
[02:36:35.463 --> 02:36:37.403]  Again, do I have to explain that's a fraud?
[02:36:37.483 --> 02:36:39.044]  Appointed governments are not freedom?
[02:36:39.719 --> 02:36:40.900]  Bush says they're not puppets.
[02:36:41.040 --> 02:36:42.021]  I agree, they're muppets.
[02:36:43.102 --> 02:36:49.949]  Iraq's foreign minister said U.S.-led forces are keeping his country from falling into chaos and must stay.
[02:36:50.229 --> 02:36:51.190]  Oh, how surprising.
[02:36:51.971 --> 02:36:53.372]  Our government's already said they'll be there for ten years.
[02:36:53.753 --> 02:36:57.056]  But he joined key Security Council nations in insisting that a U.N.
[02:36:57.096 --> 02:37:00.279]  resolution ensure greater Iraq control over its own security.
[02:37:00.319 --> 02:37:01.440]  So, see, the U.N.
[02:37:01.480 --> 02:37:04.183]  will play the part of the good cop, as we told you two years ago they would.
[02:37:05.091 --> 02:37:11.432]  Hushar Zebrari appeared before the Security Council Thursday, two days after he was named.
[02:37:11.452 --> 02:37:19.834]  He was named part of the 33-member interim government that will assume sovereignty from the U.S.-led coalition on June 30th.
[02:37:20.494 --> 02:37:21.875]  They're assuming sovereignty.
[02:37:22.935 --> 02:37:27.576]  They're appointed by our government, and then magically they go, we're sovereign, but you're the boss.
[02:37:27.596 --> 02:37:28.196]  We want you to stay.
[02:37:29.558 --> 02:37:33.161]  It's like I put a gun to your head and go, now tell people that you like what I'm doing.
[02:37:33.462 --> 02:37:34.383]  I like what you're doing.
[02:37:34.683 --> 02:37:35.243]  I like it.
[02:37:35.604 --> 02:37:36.124]  I like it.
[02:37:36.765 --> 02:37:42.550]  I stress that any premature departure of international troops would lead to chaos and the real possibility of civil war.
[02:37:43.010 --> 02:37:48.455]  In Iraq, he said, this would cause a humanitarian crisis and provide a foothold for terrorists.
[02:37:50.071 --> 02:38:02.995]  But he tempered his support for more than 150,000 troops, foreign troops in Iraq, by calling for the U.S.-British draft resolution, the resolution on Iraq sovereignty, to be more specific about the powers of the interim government and its relationship with the multinational force.
[02:38:06.076 --> 02:38:06.936]  Oh, my goodness.
[02:38:08.937 --> 02:38:12.678]  So, this is ridiculous.
[02:38:14.599 --> 02:38:17.920]  About six years ago now, I first interviewed...
[02:38:19.424 --> 02:38:23.126]  A Democratic member of the Wisconsin legislature.
[02:38:24.567 --> 02:38:26.127]  And he was ringing the alarm bell.
[02:38:26.187 --> 02:38:37.713]  He had been on a federal board, Department of Transportation, and he was in a local newspaper there in Wisconsin, I think the Green Bay newspaper, going back from memory.
[02:38:37.733 --> 02:38:38.333]  And we had him on.
[02:38:38.373 --> 02:38:39.634]  He said, here's the federal plan.
[02:38:39.694 --> 02:38:40.734]  He faxed it to me.
[02:38:40.834 --> 02:38:44.496]  I covered it many times on air and since then it's been in many other news articles.
[02:38:45.957 --> 02:38:48.098]  And he said, look, I've been in the meetings.
[02:38:48.118 --> 02:38:48.458]  They're going to
[02:38:49.440 --> 02:39:19.064]  Put all these new federal orders on states, mandates, that are going to really double the price of running our roads, internal checkpoints, toll roads, all of this, then they're going to say the answer is a national satellite tracking system, and by the way, for eight years, all the new cars have the plug-in in their ignition for the $25 to $50 satellite tracking taxation box itself that you're forced to pay for when you get taxed.
[02:39:19.841 --> 02:39:22.822]  Or when you go in for emission testing.
[02:39:24.743 --> 02:39:31.445]  This is when I first sort of really, well, before that I'd been sent magazine articles by truckers where they were saying this was the future of it and what was going to happen.
[02:39:33.006 --> 02:39:48.611]  Then last year, Oregon came out, the Associated Press, and said, yeah, we want to study in the next two years, we want to put satellite tracker boxes in all the cars, and lo and behold, magically they have the plug-ins for this and the ignition, just magically years before put in there.
[02:39:50.687 --> 02:39:52.768]  And we've been working with the feds.
[02:39:53.588 --> 02:40:05.312]  They'll administer it through the states, and the counties, the cities, the states, the federal government, and even the international government will be paid a percentage, debited out of a bank account.
[02:40:05.332 --> 02:40:07.173]  You'll have to have a special bank account to have a car.
[02:40:08.233 --> 02:40:10.054]  Or they said you can pay at the pump.
[02:40:10.074 --> 02:40:18.617]  You'll plug in the computer at the pump, and then it will add on to your gas tax, and then that's shared with the county, the city, the state, the feds, the international.
[02:40:19.213 --> 02:40:21.595]  And then that also brings in total control of the local area.
[02:40:22.515 --> 02:40:24.036]  Just like the National Sales Tax will.
[02:40:25.457 --> 02:40:26.738]  And so then they announce it.
[02:40:26.778 --> 02:40:28.879]  Then New York has got a bill introduced to do it.
[02:40:29.180 --> 02:40:31.701]  And they're moving ahead to do it, boys and girls.
[02:40:34.643 --> 02:40:35.924]  They're moving ahead to do it.
[02:40:37.805 --> 02:40:44.470]  And for two or three years, I've seen articles, and this is in my films, of course, where I got a thumb scan to get a rental car.
[02:40:45.772 --> 02:40:49.513]  When you sign the agreement, it says, oh, by the way, there's a satellite tracker in your car.
[02:40:50.294 --> 02:40:53.555]  You'll pay $200 every time you go one mile over the speed limit.
[02:40:53.835 --> 02:40:54.775]  I mean, stuff like that.
[02:40:55.876 --> 02:40:56.576]  And here it is.
[02:40:56.776 --> 02:40:57.857]  See, it's starting there.
[02:40:58.517 --> 02:41:00.077]  This is the New Haven Advocate.
[02:41:00.778 --> 02:41:08.841]  Big Brother is driving you controversial and creepy technology which lets car rental agencies track whether drivers are speeding.
[02:41:09.001 --> 02:41:12.422]  Finally, as had its day in court, privacy loses.
[02:41:13.399 --> 02:41:13.879]  We're good to go.
[02:41:38.028 --> 02:41:39.468]  May open dangerous doors.
[02:41:39.948 --> 02:41:47.830]  James Turner sued Acme American Car Rental in New Haven Superior Court for invasion of privacy and violating the state's Unfair Trade Practices Act.
[02:41:48.710 --> 02:41:55.692]  Acme automatically and without permission withdrew $450 from his bank account for speeding in an Acme minivan.
[02:41:56.612 --> 02:41:58.572]  That's $225 per speeding.
[02:41:59.532 --> 02:42:06.754]  The Whaley Avenue Agency had equipped its vehicles with a global positioning device which tracks customers' locations and driving habits.
[02:42:07.489 --> 02:42:11.951]  Acme has stuck to its self-proclaimed humanitarian guns from the get-go.
[02:42:11.971 --> 02:42:20.114]  GPS is essential in protecting against stolen cars, speeding and dangerous to the public, levying fines even for personal gain that saves lives.
[02:42:20.535 --> 02:42:24.836]  Acme also maintains that Turner knew he was being tracked because he signed a contract.
[02:42:25.236 --> 02:42:27.597]  No harm, no Orwellian foul.
[02:42:29.118 --> 02:42:31.339]  And see, they say driving's a privilege, so we'll have to do it together.
[02:42:31.559 --> 02:42:32.520]  It's not a privilege.
[02:42:32.620 --> 02:42:34.841]  The Supreme Court ruling of 1918...
[02:42:36.758 --> 02:42:43.479]  Said that you have a right to travel in the generally accepted conveyance, that being a horse and buggy or on horseback.
[02:42:44.260 --> 02:42:54.542]  But that the new, not generally used conveyances can be taxed because of some international commerce clauses they had already taxing the railroads.
[02:42:54.642 --> 02:43:00.563]  So it all started out, well, you've just got to have a license if you're driving a truck because we pay for these roads and you're making ruts.
[02:43:00.943 --> 02:43:01.843]  They use class envy.
[02:43:01.903 --> 02:43:03.124]  Yeah, make them have a license!
[02:43:04.204 --> 02:43:04.464]  You see?
[02:43:05.350 --> 02:43:07.091]  And they're not the general conveyance.
[02:43:08.272 --> 02:43:12.816]  Folks, in the 50s, in Texas, you just had little cards, 60s, 70s, and they put the face on it.
[02:43:13.196 --> 02:43:15.278]  Now the face scan, all this, the thumb scan.
[02:43:17.742 --> 02:43:19.703]  And now the car is the general conveyance.
[02:43:19.783 --> 02:43:20.883]  It is a right to travel.
[02:43:21.263 --> 02:43:22.923]  But, you see, they use that loophole.
[02:43:23.023 --> 02:43:24.024]  It is not a privilege.
[02:43:24.064 --> 02:43:25.344]  You can go, well, I heard it was.
[02:43:25.424 --> 02:43:25.924]  I'm a cop.
[02:43:25.984 --> 02:43:26.644]  I heard it was.
[02:43:26.945 --> 02:43:29.245]  Yeah, the government said black people were slaves.
[02:43:29.765 --> 02:43:31.066]  You heard they weren't humans.
[02:43:31.106 --> 02:43:31.786]  Well, they are.
[02:43:31.806 --> 02:43:35.447]  Just because you say it doesn't mean you're God and doesn't mean it's so.
[02:43:37.327 --> 02:43:39.388]  So, again, this is the move.
[02:43:39.408 --> 02:43:41.328]  Turner's assertion is quite different.
[02:43:41.348 --> 02:43:47.030]  He claims that when he signed Acme Rental's agreement in October 2000, he didn't notice the warning at the top of the contract that read,
[02:43:48.320 --> 02:43:53.262]  Vehicles in excess of posted speed limit will be charged $150 per occurrence.
[02:43:53.442 --> 02:43:55.703]  I had to remember $225, but this is $150.
[02:43:56.143 --> 02:43:56.503]  Whatever.
[02:43:57.144 --> 02:43:58.904]  All our vehicles are GPS equipped.
[02:43:59.104 --> 02:44:01.525]  A California company charges like $300 per deal.
[02:44:02.046 --> 02:44:07.228]  He didn't notice it, he claims, because no other Acme contract he'd signed previously had the warning.
[02:44:07.788 --> 02:44:09.609]  He was a frequent customer since.
[02:44:09.829 --> 02:44:14.411]  As a booking agent for New Haven Palace Theater, he did a lot of traveling.
[02:44:14.691 --> 02:44:16.972]  Turner signed the contract and left on a long...
[02:44:17.759 --> 02:44:21.280]  Strange trip into unintentional notoriety.
[02:44:22.580 --> 02:44:23.580]  And then it gets into it.
[02:44:25.901 --> 02:44:28.381]  And now it talks about other people getting mad about it.
[02:44:29.241 --> 02:44:31.562]  But you're going to have the government make you do it.
[02:44:31.842 --> 02:44:38.483]  By the way, they're already putting it in the city buses, which city buses in Austin have upwards of 10 digital cameras per bus now.
[02:44:40.283 --> 02:44:43.124]  In some cities, they're putting thumb scanners in to get on the bus.
[02:44:44.156 --> 02:44:46.357]  They're making cop cars, firemen do it.
[02:44:46.717 --> 02:44:52.459]  So if they've got to do it, if they've got to be enslaved by it, well, why should you complain, Bubba?
[02:44:54.680 --> 02:44:55.281]  Starting to get it?
[02:44:55.401 --> 02:44:58.162]  Let me hit one more article, then we'll go to these calls and back in the news.
[02:44:58.582 --> 02:45:01.503]  This is out of Local 10 News, Miami, Fort Lauderdale.
[02:45:02.964 --> 02:45:06.465]  Now, look, I'm against, you know, saying death to the Jews.
[02:45:08.906 --> 02:45:10.807]  But it's your First Amendment right to do that.
[02:45:13.524 --> 02:45:16.426]  Now, if somebody carries out that action, then you've got a problem.
[02:45:17.386 --> 02:45:18.187]  Or attempts to.
[02:45:19.828 --> 02:45:21.689]  But notice the response.
[02:45:23.350 --> 02:45:23.850]  Listen to this.
[02:45:23.950 --> 02:45:25.872]  Yearbook contains anti-Semitic message.
[02:45:26.372 --> 02:45:33.216]  Students at Key Biscayne Elementary will have to hand over their yearbooks today to have a message of hate removed.
[02:45:34.197 --> 02:45:42.462]  An 8th grader wrote an anti-Semitic remark in German in the comments section, though misspelled, translated, it means, death to the Jews.
[02:45:43.422 --> 02:45:51.388]  About 450 copies of the yearbook had already been distributed by the time a parent noticed the phrase and contacted the school.
[02:45:52.109 --> 02:45:57.433]  It's surprising that it would slip by, but in this case it did, said John Schuster of Miami-Dade County Schools.
[02:45:57.513 --> 02:46:00.655]  Students who had already had their yearbooks were told to rip out page 66.
[02:46:02.253 --> 02:46:04.834]  If that wasn't enough, the book was so evil it had to be returned.
[02:46:05.274 --> 02:46:06.335]  Which is where the words appear.
[02:46:06.715 --> 02:46:10.856]  School principal Dr. Anna M. Roscoe also sent a letter home to parents.
[02:46:10.956 --> 02:46:18.739]  In part, it reads, In spite of careful editing and ensure everything printed in memory is proper and in good taste, some inappropriate materials slip by us.
[02:46:18.779 --> 02:46:23.981]  The 8th grader, thought to be responsible, has been suspended for the rest of the school year, which ends next week.
[02:46:26.744 --> 02:46:32.146]  And there's some question of, you know, again, it's so badly spelled it may not even say that.
[02:46:32.246 --> 02:46:40.329]  But the point is, you can tell people, hey, this is in here, we apologize, rip it out if you want to, but it's, oh, it's a hate crime, remove it.
[02:46:41.013 --> 02:46:43.935]  But see, it's not just saying death to the Jews that does this.
[02:46:44.436 --> 02:46:57.766]  All over public schools, in your English class, your history class, you write an essay, if you say the word gun or firearm, you're arrested, suspended, CPS is called, you're investigated for the word gun.
[02:46:59.688 --> 02:47:05.512]  So see, this is all part of this new thought crime that they made the parents all turn in.
[02:47:07.534 --> 02:47:09.435]  Turn in that book for burning.
[02:47:11.303 --> 02:47:14.425]  Because it said something in German that one out of 10,000 might notice.
[02:47:14.785 --> 02:47:17.607]  The point is, is it just shows the atmosphere.
[02:47:19.689 --> 02:47:23.952]  So they start with something like this, but then it moves on to other things, you see.
[02:47:26.013 --> 02:47:28.495]  Let's go ahead and take some calls.
[02:47:28.515 --> 02:47:29.496]  Who's up next here?
[02:47:30.516 --> 02:47:31.737]  Will in Missouri, go ahead.
[02:47:32.478 --> 02:47:34.599]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[02:47:35.040 --> 02:47:38.862]  I heard this morning on your broadcast a report about some...
[02:47:40.287 --> 02:47:44.291]  Comet or meteor or space garbage that came down in Washington or over Washington.
[02:47:45.152 --> 02:47:46.233]  I take a nightly walk.
[02:47:46.273 --> 02:47:50.597]  I live out here in Missouri in the very most rural of areas.
[02:47:51.297 --> 02:47:55.501]  And I have a habit of listening to the power hour and then shutting it off and going for a walk.
[02:47:56.542 --> 02:48:03.649]  So about between 12.15 and 12.30 when I was facing to the north walking back towards my house,
[02:48:04.392 --> 02:48:08.756]  I saw a very, very unusual, I see hundreds and hundreds of shooting stars.
[02:48:09.016 --> 02:48:12.900]  There's no ambient light here, so it's very commonplace to see them.
[02:48:12.920 --> 02:48:29.314]  But anyway, just for a very slow, by comparison with any other space garbage, an extremely brilliant greenish-colored object was coming down, an almost plum, like you'd hang a plum bob up,
[02:48:29.787 --> 02:48:31.128]  Almost plumb and much slower.
[02:48:31.168 --> 02:48:38.274]  If you think of a shooting star as going by in a millisecond or a couple seconds, this thing was going much, much slower speed.
[02:48:38.735 --> 02:48:48.884]  And it was so brilliant, and it was so much bigger than anything I've ever seen before, that I actually thought that I was going to hear a thud when it went down behind the hollers there.
[02:48:49.444 --> 02:48:51.206]  But that was all I wanted to add.
[02:48:51.266 --> 02:48:52.927]  It was just a very unusual thing.
[02:48:52.967 --> 02:48:57.351]  I've seen lots of garbage coming around, but it was the slowest, biggest thing I'd ever seen.
[02:48:58.760 --> 02:49:01.722]  I mean, how long did it take it to traverse the sky?
[02:49:02.022 --> 02:49:03.023]  It didn't traverse.
[02:49:03.604 --> 02:49:07.766]  Shooting stars and everything that I've seen before is horizontal arcing.
[02:49:08.107 --> 02:49:09.027]  This one's straight down.
[02:49:09.087 --> 02:49:11.169]  This one's like a plumb bob dropping.
[02:49:11.729 --> 02:49:16.393]  And if you would look at it, think of it in... I was just walking, okay?
[02:49:16.593 --> 02:49:17.593]  I'm not a scientist.
[02:49:17.994 --> 02:49:24.799]  But if you would think of a shooting star as taking a second in your peripheral image, this thing was like three seconds.
[02:49:25.339 --> 02:49:26.640]  It was considerably slower.
[02:49:27.512 --> 02:49:30.954]  Yeah, I've actually seen space junk come down.
[02:49:30.974 --> 02:49:32.054]  That's exactly what it did.
[02:49:32.234 --> 02:49:50.122]  Yeah, so it may have been that, but I just wanted to say that at a 1230 central time in the evening, between 1215 and 1230 approximately, in the north horizon, I did see some big thing come down, lower and very much more brilliant green, definitely in atmosphere.
[02:49:50.162 --> 02:49:55.725]  I saw it quite a long time because I was just facing that way, and it was just a plumb line, and it came right out of,
[02:49:56.348 --> 02:49:59.169]  Wherever, and just very slow and down, and that was it.
[02:49:59.229 --> 02:50:01.750]  But if that helps anybody, there you go.
[02:50:02.010 --> 02:50:03.090]  All right, thank you for the call.
[02:50:03.130 --> 02:50:03.550]  Interesting.
[02:50:04.411 --> 02:50:10.793]  Yeah, no, what I was saying is then some people extrapolate out, you know, it's all Planet X, it's going to kill us, oh my God, you know.
[02:50:11.333 --> 02:50:15.574]  And I mean, watch, nothing's going to happen next week, folks, with Planet X getting us.
[02:50:16.495 --> 02:50:20.176]  But then the same folks will say Planet X is getting us next month, and then next month, and...
[02:50:21.374 --> 02:50:22.255]  You know, fine.
[02:50:22.575 --> 02:50:25.937]  I just stick to the concentration camps and the cancer and the vaccines.
[02:50:27.398 --> 02:50:29.259]  The horrible big stuff I can prove.
[02:50:29.839 --> 02:50:31.700]  The Marines trying to confiscate our guns.
[02:50:31.780 --> 02:50:38.144]  But the night sky is very interesting, and there have been a lot of reports of unusual things coming into the atmosphere, even in the Associated Press.
[02:50:38.164 --> 02:50:40.766]  So we'll come back, take a few final calls.
[02:50:40.886 --> 02:50:42.747]  Stay with us in a few final news articles as well.

[02:52:51.411 --> 02:52:57.553]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:52:57.853 --> 02:53:06.275]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.

[02:54:18.411 --> 02:54:19.512]  This is scary stuff.

[02:54:25.297 --> 02:54:26.438]  You better show it to people.
[02:54:26.478 --> 02:54:27.038]  Police State 2000.
[02:54:27.659 --> 02:54:28.860]  Police State do the takeover.

[02:55:43.086 --> 02:55:44.827]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing?
[02:55:44.867 --> 02:55:46.829]  I'm a long-time listener, first-time caller.
[02:55:47.690 --> 02:55:49.411]  I just want to say that
[02:55:49.949 --> 02:55:54.732]  Seeing Bush and the Pope sitting there together with that fiasco this morning was pretty disturbing.
[02:55:55.332 --> 02:56:16.503]  And also, as far as what you were saying about licenses earlier, I study creation science evangelism here in Pensacola, and my teacher has a creation science museum that he's adding on, and they're counting commissioners because he won't pay a $50 license fee because, you know, it's church and exempt and all that.
[02:56:17.106 --> 02:56:19.769]  He's also had the feds after him, hasn't he?
[02:56:19.849 --> 02:56:21.590]  That was an unlicensed station, correct?
[02:56:35.379 --> 02:56:35.920]  Yeah, they will.
[02:56:35.940 --> 02:56:38.642]  I want to make that clear, because other stations go, what, we're going to get shut down?
[02:56:38.702 --> 02:56:41.125]  No, it was an unlicensed station, which is wrong.
[02:56:41.165 --> 02:56:42.066]  They shouldn't have done that.
[02:56:43.527 --> 02:56:47.191]  People have a total right to have unlicensed radio stations if they're not interfering.
[02:56:48.252 --> 02:56:48.993]  What else is on your mind?
[02:56:49.013 --> 02:56:49.713]  I'm almost out of time.
[02:56:50.474 --> 02:56:56.901]  No, I just wanted to say that he's also got some New World Order videos, and we're trying to get the word out, but people look at us like we're cross-sighted or something.
[02:56:57.745 --> 02:57:01.608]  We're doing what we can over on this side, and I'm going to get your videos probably this weekend.
[02:57:01.868 --> 02:57:03.189]  Well, thank you, sir, and God bless.
[02:57:03.969 --> 02:57:06.351]  Let's go ahead and interview, or go ahead and take a call.
[02:57:06.451 --> 02:57:07.692]  I was thinking I'll interview that guy.
[02:57:07.712 --> 02:57:08.793]  He's sending his info.
[02:57:09.333 --> 02:57:10.134]  Roy in Texas.
[02:57:10.174 --> 02:57:10.834]  Go ahead, Roy.
[02:57:11.134 --> 02:57:11.595]  Hey, Alex.
[02:57:11.655 --> 02:57:15.097]  I have three of your videos, and everybody in the United States ought to see these things.
[02:57:15.137 --> 02:57:16.818]  I need to get the rest of them also.
[02:57:17.719 --> 02:57:19.981]  What I called you about were a couple of things real quick.
[02:57:20.701 --> 02:57:23.523]  First of all, I heard on the radio yesterday, and it's worth repeating.
[02:57:23.603 --> 02:57:24.704]  It might have even been on your show.
[02:57:24.724 --> 02:57:25.905]  It was about a doctor that had...
[02:57:26.855 --> 02:57:31.937]  The 30 Years Treated Cancer Patients, and he said the only people that didn't have cancer were people that never received a vaccination.
[02:57:32.157 --> 02:57:32.677]  Did you hear that?
[02:57:33.618 --> 02:57:39.961]  No, I didn't, but we caught them, mainstream news, with cancer viruses, not just in the polio vaccines, but in lots of them.
[02:57:40.541 --> 02:57:40.861]  Yeah, I know.
[02:57:40.881 --> 02:57:43.342]  I've heard you say that many times, and now you woke me up to that.
[02:57:44.062 --> 02:57:45.923]  I don't even go to the hospital anymore.
[02:57:45.943 --> 02:57:47.744]  You got time for another question?
[02:57:47.984 --> 02:57:48.504]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:57:48.924 --> 02:57:52.906]  Okay, I got caught in a speed trap on Highway 36 going through Rogers.
[02:57:53.602 --> 02:57:58.186]  And there was a train there over a mile long that had every kind of military vehicle you can imagine.
[02:57:58.406 --> 02:58:01.528]  I mean, it had all the Humvees, the big trucks... Gotta let you go.
[02:58:01.568 --> 02:58:04.930]  I'm sure it was going to Houston for the... It shipped off for war.
[02:58:05.671 --> 02:58:06.852]  NAR in Michigan.
[02:58:06.892 --> 02:58:07.272]  Go ahead.
[02:58:07.312 --> 02:58:08.073]  You're our tail gunner.
[02:58:10.835 --> 02:58:11.916]  NAR, you're our last caller.
[02:58:11.936 --> 02:58:12.356]  Go ahead.
[02:58:12.516 --> 02:58:13.537]  Yeah, just... How you doing?
[02:58:13.557 --> 02:58:13.637]  Fine.
[02:58:13.977 --> 02:58:21.243]  Hi, I just wanted to let you know, now in the state of Michigan, they passed a new law where the state boys can now go door-to-door...
[02:58:22.521 --> 02:58:24.823]  And register to sex offenders, you know?
[02:58:24.843 --> 02:58:25.644]  You know what's next.
[02:58:27.025 --> 02:58:29.727]  Well, again, it's every type of crime.
[02:58:29.767 --> 02:58:31.188]  It's about getting us all in the system.
[02:58:31.568 --> 02:58:32.989]  All right, thanks for all the calls.
[02:58:33.050 --> 02:58:34.891]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight, back on Monday, 11 to 2.
[02:58:38.163 --> 02:58:39.205]  The war on terrorism.
[02:58:39.525 --> 02:58:42.309]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:58:42.590 --> 02:58:46.736]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:58:47.177 --> 02:58:48.018]  So what do you do?
[02:58:48.319 --> 02:58:52.886]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:58:53.366 --> 02:58:55.488]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:58:55.989 --> 02:59:10.682]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:59:10.722 --> 02:59:17.789]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
