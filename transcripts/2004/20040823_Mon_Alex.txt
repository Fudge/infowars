[00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:09.755]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:11.236]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.976 --> 00:00:13.017]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.537 --> 00:00:17.440]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.803]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:33.356]  Alright my friends, it's Monday.
[00:00:33.376 --> 00:00:35.197]  Breaking open a whole other week.
[00:00:36.458 --> 00:00:38.219]  Fresh broadcast week.
[00:00:38.919 --> 00:00:41.160]  The 23rd day of August 2004.
[00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.101]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:45.782]  The website's freshly updated for you daily.
[00:00:45.982 --> 00:00:51.265]  Infowars.com PrisonPlanet.tv and PrisonPlanet.com
[00:00:52.293 --> 00:00:54.717]  Gonna have wide open phones today.
[00:00:54.737 --> 00:00:59.283]  A lot of new Camp X-Ray and Abu Ghraib news.
[00:00:59.383 --> 00:01:04.291]  More details on how the doctors would resuscitate people so they could be tortured some more.
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.441]  Just amazing stuff.
[00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:12.323]  We'll get into the Republican National Convention that's coming up and the police state preparations for that.
[00:01:13.603 --> 00:01:16.644]  What it means to have exploding crude oil prices.
[00:01:17.305 --> 00:01:22.246]  In the next hour we have Michelle Malkin, one of the new neocon beauties.
[00:01:23.307 --> 00:01:28.509]  Kind of a clone of Ann Coulter, though she's been around for a while and I agree with a lot of what she has to say, by the way, but a lot of it I don't.
[00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:31.830]  She has this new book out called In Defense of Internment Camps.
[00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:36.142]  Or in defense of internment, the case for interning people.
[00:01:36.783 --> 00:01:41.007]  And she'll be joining us to talk about this, and we'll be going over it with her.
[00:01:41.347 --> 00:01:44.590]  So, you do not want to miss that in the next hour.
[00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.253]  And as usual, at least once a week Paul Watson joins us.
[00:01:47.633 --> 00:01:49.635]  He's scheduled in the third hour.
[00:01:50.484 --> 00:01:57.069]  More news articles about John Kerry related to the Queen of England and every other royal family in Europe, including Eastern Europe.
[00:01:57.629 --> 00:02:02.352]  Buchanan's new book declares no conservative party left in Washington.
[00:02:02.792 --> 00:02:03.433]  Absolutely.
[00:02:03.973 --> 00:02:05.454]  But it's like there's two different Buchanans.
[00:02:05.474 --> 00:02:08.316]  There's the Buchanan that's on MSNBC, who I don't agree with.
[00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:12.139]  And then there's the Buchanan I agree with, who writes books.
[00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:15.241]  So, what's really going on here with Mr. Buchanan?
[00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:20.724]  By the way, I've given money to Buchanan before, folks, so I have a right to sit here and bash him.
[00:02:20.764 --> 00:02:26.971]  We have listeners that are just Buchanan worshippers, and they get mad if I'm saying bad about him, but I mean, come on, folks.
[00:02:27.672 --> 00:02:31.316]  The guy's really been flip-flopping like he's John Kerry or something.
[00:02:31.876 --> 00:02:36.260]  But I agree with this new book that's out, but I don't agree with some of the stuff I've heard him say on MSNBC.
[00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:44.747]  Also, new FDA analysis backs suggestions of link between antidepressants and suicidal tendencies in children.
[00:02:45.127 --> 00:02:46.509]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:46.949]  Wait a minute.
[00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:58.939]  Back when they approved the stuff 21 years ago, Prozac namely, they admitted a massive increase in suicide, but got that off of the advisement that went along with it.
[00:03:00.323 --> 00:03:02.504]  So, what's really going on here?
[00:03:04.145 --> 00:03:10.048]  They're having to put it now in some of the antidepressant packages, so it's not a link, it's not speculation.
[00:03:10.388 --> 00:03:26.417]  This is well known, but they're trying to push it on our children, and now they're hiring all these, uh, all these famous people to get out there and push these dangerous antidepressants, these serotonin uptake inhibitors, like Terry Bradshaw and many others.
[00:03:26.937 --> 00:03:28.298]  Oh, by the way, um,
[00:03:29.404 --> 00:03:37.694]  I mentioned last week and we had a guest on about how the Texas Guard is going to be dealing with domestic populations and running police state maneuvers.
[00:03:38.355 --> 00:03:44.442]  That was actually the front page of the Statesman on Saturday here in Austin.
[00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:56.257]  So, as usual, we're reporting it long before the mainstream media finally gets to it, and they put their whole spin on it, but admit that it's quite a departure from disaster relief, and this is happening all over the country.
[00:03:56.797 --> 00:04:04.786]  Now our state guard is going to be doing mass arrests, gun confiscations, basically takeover of the government.
[00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:17.883]  And of course, a few weeks ago we had the Alabama Defense Force on, where anybody can go be given a green uniform and an MP armband, and you go out and search the children on the street corners, training us how to live in a police state.
[00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:24.526]  And that's what the statesmen got into, is how they're going to be on our streets, just overseeing our lives.
[00:04:25.886 --> 00:04:28.667]  The complete opposite of a free country.
[00:04:29.748 --> 00:04:33.389]  And it's despicable to think that they're going to be able to get away with this.
[00:04:35.043 --> 00:04:40.265]  Now, the toll-free number to join us will go to your calls early in this first hour, as I've been doing lately.
[00:04:40.305 --> 00:04:41.185]  Doing a pretty good job of that.
[00:04:41.205 --> 00:04:41.605]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:41.625 --> 00:04:41.745]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:41.765 --> 00:04:47.827]  Any news item, any story you want to talk about, you've got a comment, a question, we'd love to hear from you at 800-259-9231.
[00:04:47.847 --> 00:04:48.728]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:48.748 --> 00:04:49.428]  Remember, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:01.508 --> 00:05:03.929]  Two nuclear powers rattle sabers over a disputed area.
[00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:08.211]  Peace in the Middle East derailed again as another wave of suicide bombers destabilized the region.
[00:05:08.612 --> 00:05:11.253]  Here at home and abroad, our own war against terror continues.
[00:05:11.553 --> 00:05:12.213]  Important news.
[00:05:12.293 --> 00:05:15.015]  The news you need is sketchy at best when it comes to the mainstream press.
[00:05:15.355 --> 00:05:21.118]  With Grundig's Yachtboy 400PE World Band Shortwave Radio, world news, news that affects you, will be at your fingertips.
[00:05:21.458 --> 00:05:25.380]  The Yachtboy 400PE is rated as the number one portable shortwave radio in the industry.
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:36.713]  And for no small reason, when you consider ease of operation and features like over 40 station presets, both upper and lower sidebands, as well as ship-to-shore weather and aviation bands, the Grumman Yachtboy 400PE is fully digital.
[00:05:36.733 --> 00:05:40.338]  It comes with its own carrying case, external antenna, and a headset for private listening.
[00:05:40.658 --> 00:05:47.084]  Normally retailing for $249, the Grundig Yacht Boy 400PE is now available from Cliff Scott Enterprises for only $149.95.
[00:05:47.124 --> 00:05:47.924]  Call toll-free 1-800-569-4340.

[00:06:00.262 --> 00:06:07.104]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:06:07.424 --> 00:06:08.804]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:06:08.984 --> 00:06:11.185]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:06:11.345 --> 00:06:13.425]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:18.647]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:06:18.967 --> 00:06:23.008]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:06:23.248 --> 00:06:25.049]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:06:25.109 --> 00:06:35.756]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:06:35.916 --> 00:06:37.797]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.111]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:07:02.431 --> 00:07:05.213]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:07:05.493 --> 00:07:09.635]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:10.895]  So what do you do?
[00:07:11.216 --> 00:07:15.778]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:07:16.258 --> 00:07:18.379]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.780]  Sheltering in Place.
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.882]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[00:07:24.202 --> 00:07:33.567]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[00:07:49.474 --> 00:07:49.894]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:07.981]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.701 --> 00:08:09.802]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.463 --> 00:08:11.303]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.044 --> 00:08:12.904]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.924 --> 00:08:17.308]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.788 --> 00:08:21.931]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.454 --> 00:08:31.218]  Chuck Baldwin, a real conservative, wrote this, and it's on PrisonPlanet.com right now,
[00:08:32.222 --> 00:08:36.824]  Washington D.C., not Baghdad, threatens our liberties.
[00:08:37.484 --> 00:08:48.169]  Not since the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and the Nazi takeover in Germany has a western nation seen the kind of collapse of individual freedom that the United States of America is currently seeing.
[00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:54.052]  Under President George W. Bush, the constitutional protections of our liberties are speedily vanishing.
[00:08:54.622 --> 00:09:00.428]  News reports of the demise of our freedoms are so common it is difficult to keep up with all of them.
[00:09:00.488 --> 00:09:18.886]  For example, the August 16th edition of Newsweek reports Representative Porter Goss, President Bush's nominee to head the CIA, recently introduced legislation that would give the President new authority to direct the CIA agents to conduct law enforcement operations inside the United States, including arresting American citizens.
[00:09:19.835 --> 00:09:27.760]  The legislation introduced by Goss on June 16th and touted as the Intelligence Reform Bill would substantially restructure the U.S.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:36.706]  intelligence community by giving the Director of Central Intelligence, or DCI, broad new powers to oversee its various components scattered throughout the government.
[00:09:37.146 --> 00:09:42.172]  Another report of America's dissolving liberties was published by World Daily on June 21st, 2004.
[00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:57.149]  It said, President Bush's plans to unveil next month a sweeping mental health initiative that recommends screening for every citizen and promotes the use of expensive antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs favored by supporters of the administration.
[00:09:57.737 --> 00:10:03.823]  Can anyone imagine anything more Orwellian than a federal government to be given the power to screen every American citizen?
[00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:06.225]  This is right out of Huxley's Brave New World!
[00:10:06.665 --> 00:10:08.827]  Another disturbing report came from the New American.
[00:10:09.267 --> 00:10:10.508]  It told how U.S.
[00:10:10.549 --> 00:10:15.933]  Supreme Court has upheld the right of President Bush to suspend habeas corpus protections of U.S.
[00:10:15.953 --> 00:10:16.394]  citizens.
[00:10:16.734 --> 00:10:19.957]  The vote was 8-1 with only Justice Anthony Scalia dissenting.
[00:10:20.655 --> 00:10:38.861]  The New American Report said it is unusually pointed dissent, just as Anthony Scalia condemned the majority decision for eviscerating the habeas corpus guarantee, which prevents the government from indefinitely imposing individuals, imprisoning individuals without formal criminal charges or legal recourse.
[00:10:39.756 --> 00:10:57.153]  Invoking Alexander Hamilton's warning against Americans resorting to a response and security to institutions which have a tendency to destroy their civil and political rights, Scalia observes the founders warned us about the risk and equipped us with a constitution designed to deal with it.
[00:10:57.473 --> 00:11:04.240]  However, he concludes, the court has proceeded to meet the current emergency in a manner the constitution doesn't envision.
[00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:14.815]  One that may ultimately prove deadlier to our system of ordered liberty than anything Al-Qaeda could inflict upon us.
[00:11:15.315 --> 00:11:25.940]  All Americans need to remember that it doesn't matter one iota whether it is fascist-leaning conservative or a socialist-leaning liberal who attempts to steal our God-given liberties.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.942]  Each is equally a tyrant and should be vigorously opposed by liberty-loving people everywhere.
[00:11:32.663 --> 00:11:32.903]  Well,
[00:11:34.048 --> 00:11:38.410]  Did Benjamin Franklin say, rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God?
[00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.832]  Again, well, did Benjamin Franklin say rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God?
[00:11:44.192 --> 00:11:54.537]  The American people also need to realize that we are in a fight to preserve our liberties and that the major source of this attack against our freedoms is coming not from Baghdad, but from Washington D.C.
[00:11:55.277 --> 00:12:11.782]  Therefore, be they Democrats or Republicans, men or women, white or blacks, conservatives or liberals, Christians or pagans, all who attempt to use their political or judicial offices to trample our constitutionally protected liberties, must be met with by unyielding resistance.
[00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:17.804]  Alright, I babbled through that for you, but I think it's well said, and that's only the tip of the iceberg.
[00:12:17.844 --> 00:12:18.804]  I mean, a few months ago,
[00:12:19.975 --> 00:12:34.626]  Here in Austin, Texas, the Daily Texan reported, and the Wall Street Journal picked it up, that secret police, military troops, in three-piece suits, were going around harassing peace activists and going to the law school and trying to intimidate the dean and others.
[00:12:36.407 --> 00:12:42.151]  And we have, again, reports all over the country of the state guards being turned into domestic crime fighters.
[00:12:42.792 --> 00:12:45.313]  They admit it's not even for terrorism now.
[00:12:46.214 --> 00:12:47.175]  It's to track and trace
[00:12:47.868 --> 00:12:48.848]  of the population.
[00:12:49.368 --> 00:12:56.330]  All over the country, cameras and microphones and face scanning systems are going in, but the borders are wide open.
[00:12:57.211 --> 00:12:58.111]  This is amazing!
[00:12:59.611 --> 00:13:08.054]  Meanwhile, the 9-11 Commission, this is the Washington Times, national ID is seen in 9-11 panel plan.
[00:13:08.074 --> 00:13:09.154]  We've talked a lot about this.
[00:13:09.554 --> 00:13:13.155]  McCain came out last week and said we need a national ID card.
[00:13:13.195 --> 00:13:15.596]  Well, this is how the New World Order operates.
[00:13:16.539 --> 00:13:23.385]  What they'll do is they'll put the national ID card in and then say, oh, we're going to make you use a national ID card.
[00:13:24.066 --> 00:13:34.354]  Almost every state, 40 plus states, have a federally mandated, under federal specifications, in a federal database, driver's license issuance system.
[00:13:35.055 --> 00:13:38.378]  With the face scan, with the thumb scan, in some cases with a retina scan.
[00:13:39.045 --> 00:13:43.870]  And this is the Maritime Administration, this is Homeland Security, this is control.
[00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:47.113]  And so they put it in place and then announce you've got to do it.
[00:13:48.574 --> 00:14:01.267]  The September 11th Commission's recommendation for federal standards of identification documents such as a driver's license and birth certificates is tantamount to the introduction of a national ID card system through the back door, some lawmakers believe.
[00:14:01.835 --> 00:14:12.898]  The Commission stopped short of actually recommending the introduction of a National ID Card, but did say the fight against terrorism required greater consistency and security of state-issued identification documents.
[00:14:13.259 --> 00:14:20.921]  There needs to be consistent standards to issue and ensure the integrity of both the document and the issued process.
[00:14:21.681 --> 00:14:27.903]  The Commission member, Jamie S. Gorlick, a former Clinton Administration Justice Department official said.
[00:14:28.832 --> 00:14:38.379]  The Commission also recommended a radical transformation of the way government data is stored to facilitate the free-flow information among federal agencies and between them and the state and local governments.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:47.906]  And they went on to say, if you have federal standards from the House Judiciary Committee meeting and a free-flow information system between states and the federal government,
[00:14:48.564 --> 00:14:53.427]  About the holders of licenses, that's the difference between that and the National ID.
[00:14:53.587 --> 00:15:11.956]  As Representative Christopher B. Cannon, Republican of Utah, Commissioner Slade Gorton, a former Republican Senator from Washington, said the difference is that the driver's licenses are already widely accepted, and are used as a de facto ID card, but are issued according to different state standards, and are too easy to obtain without proper identification.
[00:15:13.397 --> 00:15:17.459]  Again, the state driver's licenses are already the National ID card, and they, look,
[00:15:18.883 --> 00:15:21.745]  They've got Proposition 200 in Arizona.
[00:15:22.666 --> 00:15:26.528]  And it just says that if somebody has a fake ID, they shouldn't be able to use it.
[00:15:27.169 --> 00:15:30.771]  It says that if someone is caught cheating in an election, they can be arrested.
[00:15:31.051 --> 00:15:32.012]  It's real simple.
[00:15:32.492 --> 00:15:44.240]  But the Democrats, universally, as well as most Republicans, are spending two million dollars trying to block that law being passed, that referendum coming up.
[00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:55.318]  I mean, there was a Houston Chronicle article a few weeks ago about hundreds of thousands of felons and criminals being ordered to be released from federal and state jails.
[00:15:56.239 --> 00:15:58.941]  I mean, if you're an illegal alien, you have more rights than citizens.
[00:15:59.901 --> 00:16:11.170]  And my point is that this country's wide open, wide open to terrorist attack, real or manufactured, nothing's being done to truly stop it, and the illegal aliens
[00:16:12.009 --> 00:16:16.131]  Or anyone else for that matter can go out and get as many fake IDs as they want.
[00:16:16.451 --> 00:16:19.533]  And when they're caught with them, they don't get in trouble.
[00:16:20.413 --> 00:16:22.174]  It's not just that they don't enforce it.
[00:16:22.554 --> 00:16:29.537]  The government, the federal government, comes in and tries to block state moves that are coming from the grassroots to control this.
[00:16:30.197 --> 00:16:37.561]  So they're telling us that we need national ID cards and to have mental health screening and to be tracked and traced and totally controlled.
[00:16:38.121 --> 00:16:52.744]  And Governor Ridge on video on C-SPAN years ago said that we're all going to have to have a special ID card to have any job, and government security clearances to have jobs, and we're going to have a new national sales tax that brings federal control into every local business.
[00:16:52.764 --> 00:16:54.625]  You're going to have to swipe your card to do that.
[00:16:55.065 --> 00:16:56.765]  This is all admitted!
[00:16:57.745 --> 00:17:00.706]  But it has nothing to do with keeping us safe from terrorism.
[00:17:01.046 --> 00:17:05.227]  It's about a cashless society taxation tracking control grid.
[00:17:07.686 --> 00:17:12.210]  Oh boy, I'm coming pretty fast out of the gates here today with this news, but there's just so much of it.
[00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:13.151]  Here's some of the other news.
[00:17:13.211 --> 00:17:23.960]  Senate Republicans lay dismantling the CIA, but then when you really read into it, it's having it be reborn on steroids with its hair on fire.
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.283]  Protesters, police get set in New York City.
[00:17:27.303 --> 00:17:29.625]  By the way, I am going to New York, folks.
[00:17:30.826 --> 00:17:34.709]  We'll be having live reports in the broadcast with our fill-in host.
[00:17:35.666 --> 00:17:39.468]  Also, Bush not welcome, site for Olympic security planners.
[00:17:39.488 --> 00:17:40.248]  We'll get into that.
[00:17:41.289 --> 00:17:45.911]  Also, George W. Bush, the neocons and the Nazis, ties that bind.
[00:17:46.392 --> 00:17:47.572]  We'll get into that article.
[00:17:48.292 --> 00:17:53.415]  Pakistan denies holding names of captured Al Qaeda members until U.S.
[00:17:53.495 --> 00:17:54.075]  election.
[00:17:54.496 --> 00:17:56.297]  That's out of the United Press International.
[00:17:56.777 --> 00:17:59.598]  Hope condemns unethical science of cloning.

[00:18:15.127 --> 00:18:18.050]  Police tell journalist to leave Nogif or be shot.
[00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:19.952]  Boy, that's our government doing that.
[00:18:20.573 --> 00:18:24.237]  Also, re-engineering
[00:18:25.095 --> 00:18:28.338]  Meanvilla, the torture doctors of Abu Ghraib.
[00:18:28.959 --> 00:18:30.280]  We're going to get into that.
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.984]  Also Ted Turner, Bankroll's major anarchist group.
[00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:35.185]  L.A.'
[00:18:35.145 --> 00:18:39.229]  's latest to zap gamers with curfew.
[00:18:39.249 --> 00:18:42.692]  Graphic designer fired after heckling Bush.
[00:18:44.694 --> 00:18:48.317]  It says Highland's county curfew extended another week.
[00:18:48.357 --> 00:18:49.979]  Talk about what's happening in Florida.
[00:18:50.835 --> 00:18:51.335]  F.B.I.
[00:18:51.415 --> 00:19:00.597]  comes calling on activist software engineer, NORTHCOM developing homeland security technology, sharing sensitive data with foreign NATO nations.
[00:19:00.938 --> 00:19:12.860]  So not only is the Pentagon illegally spying on us, but now they're going to do it with the foreigners, the foreign systems of NATO and Interpol and the U.N.
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.521]  That's already been happening, but now it's going public.
[00:19:15.541 --> 00:19:19.342]  This is out of Military Information Technology, August issue.
[00:19:20.462 --> 00:19:23.804]  Also, well this one's interesting.
[00:19:24.164 --> 00:19:36.790]  Eagle Broadband Security awarded 1.6 million contract for remote video surveillance system for government-owned housing units and they say everything you do living in the housing units is tracked and traced and watched.

[00:19:47.009 --> 00:19:48.373]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.

[00:21:59.668 --> 00:22:05.892]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:06.352 --> 00:22:14.118]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:14.458 --> 00:22:22.323]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:22.623 --> 00:22:27.386]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:27.726 --> 00:22:32.408]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.

[00:23:02.707 --> 00:23:07.391]  They've made the mistake of using a pet odor and stain product that only covers the problem temporarily.
[00:23:07.571 --> 00:23:09.092]  We don't have that problem in our home.
[00:23:09.293 --> 00:23:11.694]  We've discovered it's just better to use PAWS.

[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.642]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:24:05.183 --> 00:24:08.506]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:17.405]  Well, she's scheduled, coming up here in about 40 minutes, Michelle Malkin, in defense of internment camps.
[00:24:17.465 --> 00:24:20.287]  It's her new book, how wonderful the camps are and how great they are.
[00:24:21.348 --> 00:24:24.771]  Of course, don't worry, they're not going to be for the Muslims, they'll be for Christian conservatives.
[00:24:25.371 --> 00:24:27.433]  But, you know, they're a lot of fun.
[00:24:28.193 --> 00:24:31.335]  Let's go ahead and talk to Davey in Dallas, Texas.
[00:24:31.355 --> 00:24:32.696]  You're on the air, thanks for holding.
[00:24:33.037 --> 00:24:36.159]  Hey, Alex, I think I smell a stinky possum in the attic.
[00:24:38.052 --> 00:24:40.714]  Sometimes I really get a kick out of the way you talk.
[00:24:42.276 --> 00:24:43.236]  I really appreciate that.
[00:24:43.297 --> 00:24:46.219]  Say Alex, I just want to give you a heads up on this History Channel.
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:58.269]  This morning they ran a couple of shows about Arab terrorists and they had an FBI agent on the second segment talking about the first World Trade Center bombing.
[00:24:58.289 --> 00:25:02.913]  Saying that they didn't know how the bomb got there or who put it there.
[00:25:03.954 --> 00:25:05.736]  I thought you might find that pretty interesting.
[00:25:08.314 --> 00:25:12.617]  Well, why would they feel the need to say they didn't know who made the bomb or put it there?
[00:25:13.038 --> 00:25:13.818]  It's admitted.
[00:25:13.858 --> 00:25:16.580]  The FBI admits they were caught on tape by their own informant.
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:17.861]  They cooked the bomb.
[00:25:17.901 --> 00:25:18.802]  They trained the driver.
[00:25:19.042 --> 00:25:20.763]  The informant thought it was going to be a sting.
[00:25:20.783 --> 00:25:26.828]  It was in the Chicago Tribune, New York Times, Associated Press, CBS News, for one day after it happened.
[00:25:27.388 --> 00:25:35.193]  About a week after it happened, this broke in the news, and it was in the news for one day, and they admit it's accurate, but then they just suddenly took it off the front pages.
[00:25:35.593 --> 00:25:41.716]  The FBI cooked the bomb, trained the driver, and Mr. Salam, Ahmad Salam, who'd worked for the U.S.
[00:25:41.736 --> 00:25:44.718]  government for a decade, he was an intelligence officer for Egypt,
[00:25:45.484 --> 00:25:50.305]  He came to them and said, okay, let's run the sting, and they said, no, we're going to let it go forward.
[00:25:50.345 --> 00:25:51.865]  Now that's public record!
[00:25:52.165 --> 00:25:56.026]  Is that on your film, Road to Tyranny, or is that Total Enslavement?
[00:25:56.186 --> 00:26:04.048]  It's in Road to Tyranny, and also the Chicago Tribune, New York Times articles are on the 9-11 section of PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:26:04.248 --> 00:26:13.810]  Well, I thought you did an excellent job exposing that, which very few Americans know about, and that's my point is to giving people a heads up and an alert on this History Channel program.
[00:26:14.557 --> 00:26:26.265]  This morning, Pat Robertson had Danny Ayalon on, the Israeli Ambassador, and they're just underscoring this theme that, you know, the Muslim terrorists are out to get us.
[00:26:26.345 --> 00:26:33.450]  And right now, Lee Hamilton's talking at the September 11th Commission, you know, hearing up there in Congress about terrorist financing.
[00:26:33.891 --> 00:26:36.913]  Have you ever considered doing a show on Dary Al-Sin, Alex?
[00:26:38.054 --> 00:26:38.734]  No, I haven't.
[00:26:38.774 --> 00:26:40.135]  Tell folks about this person.
[00:26:40.796 --> 00:26:42.457]  Well, Dary Al-Sin was a village.
[00:26:43.081 --> 00:26:51.807]  In Palestine, and in April of 1948, the inhabitants of that village were massacred by Zionist terrorists.
[00:26:52.528 --> 00:27:05.297]  And this is what caused the initial wave of about 800,000 Palestinians to leave their homes, and allowed the Zionists to come in and take over their homes and their land, and have never allowed them to return.
[00:27:05.357 --> 00:27:12.442]  And this is essentially the nexus, or the genesis of, you know, what they refer to as Arab terrorism.
[00:27:13.986 --> 00:27:14.426]  All right.
[00:27:15.047 --> 00:27:16.807]  One more final point if I might.
[00:27:16.827 --> 00:27:17.007]  Sure.
[00:27:17.027 --> 00:27:20.289]  Did you see anything about Ramsey Clark over the weekend?
[00:27:21.329 --> 00:27:21.869]  No, I didn't.
[00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:23.330]  I saw a posting.
[00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:29.773]  I didn't get to read it, but it was about a suit filed against Bush and their cabal.
[00:27:30.793 --> 00:27:32.334]  Do you have a Ramsey's number?
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:40.530]  No, I've had Mr. Clark on the broadcast before, I've interviewed him, and of course I don't agree with him on gun control and the U.N.
[00:27:41.992 --> 00:27:44.856]  Yeah, but he has introduced suits in the past.
[00:27:44.937 --> 00:27:46.098]  What's his latest suit about?
[00:27:50.645 --> 00:27:58.708]  I really don't know for sure, but I'd be happy to pass along... Well, it's funny you say that, because I was at a friend's house and they had a TV on in the background, and they were going, oh, look, Ramsey Clark!
[00:27:59.048 --> 00:28:00.209]  And I wasn't paying attention.
[00:28:00.809 --> 00:28:08.611]  Well, you know, he had recently been involved, I believe a car hit him and broke his leg or something, back in February.
[00:28:08.631 --> 00:28:11.352]  I don't know.
[00:28:14.376 --> 00:28:23.761]  Memorial service at Mount Carmel back in April and Clive said that Ramsey was rehabilitating, that he had been hurt in a vehicle.
[00:28:23.841 --> 00:28:26.762]  Alright, well thanks for the call sir, I appreciate it.
[00:28:26.903 --> 00:28:34.066]  And for those that don't know, Ramsey Clark almost every year comes to the memorial for those that died at Waco on April 19th, 1993.
[00:28:34.166 --> 00:28:37.568]  And now we've, what is it, 11 years since those horrible events?
[00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:44.391]  We don't have time to go to your calls now.
[00:28:44.411 --> 00:28:49.412]  When we break, we'll come back and go to Rodney and Ray and many others.
[00:28:49.452 --> 00:28:51.533]  The toll-free number to join us on-air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:28:51.553 --> 00:28:51.613]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:28:51.633 --> 00:28:57.814]  Also, I've got an article here out of the Washington Post, Air Watch List, Tell What's in a Name.
[00:28:57.834 --> 00:28:58.254]  And it gets into
[00:29:13.505 --> 00:29:18.027]  Why people are having their names put on no-fly lists, and it's not just Edward Kennedy.
[00:29:18.847 --> 00:29:20.828]  It's other members of the Congress.
[00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:31.712]  And they found a way to get around this, so we'll discuss the no-fly list and what's really happening with that.
[00:29:33.373 --> 00:29:37.615]  By the time the globalists are done, to get on a plane, a bus, to drive your car, to have a license,
[00:29:38.562 --> 00:29:41.223]  Why, if you're on the list, you're not going to be able to do any of that.
[00:29:41.283 --> 00:29:42.463]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[00:29:42.904 --> 00:29:44.064]  Won't be able to have a job.
[00:29:44.564 --> 00:29:46.825]  They'll deactivate your national ID card.
[00:29:47.445 --> 00:29:49.266]  Total enslavement.
[00:29:50.466 --> 00:29:51.387]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.847 --> 00:29:53.468]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.368 --> 00:29:57.049]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.064 --> 00:30:08.545]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:08.965 --> 00:30:13.206]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:30:13.426 --> 00:30:20.468]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:20.848 --> 00:30:26.950]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:28.290]  There are no side effects.
[00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:31.613]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:30:31.753 --> 00:30:32.654]  Eliminate the cost.
[00:30:32.734 --> 00:30:33.675]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:30:34.076 --> 00:30:41.323]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:30:41.623 --> 00:30:45.007]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[00:31:00.655 --> 00:31:02.276]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:02.416 --> 00:31:06.517]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:06.657 --> 00:31:09.538]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:09.618 --> 00:31:16.320]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.501]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:31:19.721 --> 00:31:22.102]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:31:22.222 --> 00:31:30.125]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:31:30.385 --> 00:31:41.709]  Caprazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.

[00:32:20.647 --> 00:32:25.149]  Right now we're making a major recommendation in the energy markets and specifically heating oil.
[00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:29.450]  Currently known market news may already be factored into the underlying market price.
[00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:31.431]  Energy prices have been on the move.
[00:32:31.751 --> 00:32:34.132]  America is in an energy crisis.
[00:32:34.492 --> 00:32:36.192]  OPEC hasn't kept up on supplies.
[00:32:36.512 --> 00:32:38.813]  Refineries haven't been able to keep up with demand.
[00:32:39.073 --> 00:32:40.994]  Demand from China has been insatiable.

[00:32:50.262 --> 00:32:50.743]  Mystery Solved!
[00:33:06.241 --> 00:33:08.142]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.623 --> 00:33:11.465]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:23.873 --> 00:33:25.334]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:25.394 --> 00:33:26.595]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:33:26.895 --> 00:33:30.798]  Your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:32.958 --> 00:33:36.641]  Before I go any further, though, let's jump straight back into the news.
[00:33:36.901 --> 00:33:42.125]  Armed thieves steal Munich's The Scream, or Munch's The Scream.
[00:33:42.165 --> 00:33:43.286]  Can't seem to read today.
[00:33:43.346 --> 00:33:45.088]  This is out of The Scotsman.
[00:33:45.668 --> 00:33:57.938]  Armed masked thieves barged into Oslo Museum and ripped the Edvard Munch masterpiece, The Scream, and another painting from the walls, stunning visitors who watched in disbelief.
[00:33:58.659 --> 00:34:00.300]  Brandishing handguns, the robbers
[00:34:01.249 --> 00:34:11.574]  Barge past guards yesterday at the Munich Museum, the Munch Museum, and loaded the painting and another titled Madonna into a getaway car before speeding off, police said.
[00:34:11.634 --> 00:34:12.295]  No one was hurt.
[00:34:13.235 --> 00:34:16.637]  A nationwide hunt for the thieves was underway, police said.
[00:34:17.513 --> 00:34:22.817]  It's the second time in a decade that this version of the iconic painting has been stolen.
[00:34:22.857 --> 00:34:32.743]  Another version of the Scream, one of four that he painted, was stolen from Oslo's National Gallery in February 1994, but recovered three months later.
[00:34:32.863 --> 00:34:40.328]  Experts said the paintings are worth tens of millions of pounds, or dollars, and that the thieves probably would demand a ransom for them.
[00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:44.351]  I thought they've got gun control over there.
[00:34:44.391 --> 00:34:45.872]  Why didn't they keep them safe from this?
[00:34:46.972 --> 00:34:50.275]  FDA analysis backs antidepressant concern.
[00:34:50.375 --> 00:34:56.980]  New FDA analysis backs suggestions of link between antidepressants and suicidal tendencies.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.121]  This is from ABC News.
[00:34:58.602 --> 00:35:07.209]  And it says federal health officials are preparing stronger warnings for some antidepressants used in children after new analysis backs a possible
[00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:11.191]  Well, they're already discussing all the old drugs that have had their patents run out, that are now generic.
[00:35:11.211 --> 00:35:16.654]  Those will all be listed as evil, and all the new ones, which have basically the same molecular structure, well, you'll all be told how safe those are.
[00:35:37.569 --> 00:35:51.743]  When Prozac was approved back in the early 80's, there was a big scandal because they covered up the findings and the government said just disregard those of a huge increase in suicide.
[00:35:52.784 --> 00:35:53.725]  Massive increase.
[00:35:54.426 --> 00:35:55.667]  And then just common sense.
[00:35:55.887 --> 00:35:58.549]  I mean, these things put you into a mesmerized state of mind.
[00:35:58.929 --> 00:36:01.550]  They are in the hallucinogen class.
[00:36:02.051 --> 00:36:04.092]  They are literally mind control drugs.
[00:36:04.212 --> 00:36:14.958]  And every mass shooter I've seen, literally, I haven't seen one case of a woman drowning four children, or putting a baby in the trash can, or people walking into school shooting other students.
[00:36:16.019 --> 00:36:18.060]  Larry Ashbrook, Buford Furrow,
[00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:26.413]  Harris, Kleibold, in every case these people, Kip Kinkle, they're on these drugs.
[00:36:26.573 --> 00:36:28.894]  I haven't seen a case where they're not on these drugs.
[00:36:31.275 --> 00:36:34.196]  And the article continues with disinformation, while the remains
[00:36:35.979 --> 00:36:51.203]  signal of risk for some drugs and some trials it is important to note that the data are not black and white in providing a clear and definite answer FDA psychiatric drug chief Dr. Thomas Lundgren wrote to the advisory panel this week.
[00:36:53.527 --> 00:37:18.847]  And I saw an article in the local paper here in Austin this weekend where they had Terry Bradshaw and all these bigwigs, all these celebrities who go out, whether they're in rock bands or movie stars or former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterbacks, they travel the country and anytime they're at a meeting or a rock concert or on television, they mention how much they love the drugs and how good they are.
[00:37:19.347 --> 00:37:31.222]  Just out-propagandizing, not just in TV ads and radio ads and newspaper ads, but whenever they speak to high schools, even in their capacity outside of being with the drug companies.
[00:37:31.262 --> 00:37:32.604]  They just promote it everywhere.
[00:37:33.925 --> 00:37:37.730]  And why, if the big stars are on it, why shouldn't I be on it?
[00:37:38.672 --> 00:37:43.893]  We're going to go to calls now, and then I'll get into John Kerry related to the Queen of England, another article about that.
[00:37:44.494 --> 00:37:49.675]  Also, Buchanan book declares no conservative party left in Washington.
[00:37:49.695 --> 00:37:50.635]  I agree with that.
[00:37:51.496 --> 00:37:57.837]  We'll get into reincarnating Mingala, the tortured doctors of Abu Ghraib.
[00:38:00.398 --> 00:38:04.219]  First though, before I go to your calls, I said I'd hit this article, so here it is.
[00:38:04.919 --> 00:38:07.880]  Air Watch List, tell what's in a name.
[00:38:09.858 --> 00:38:14.279]  Now, Green Party activists, land rights activists can't fly all of a sudden.
[00:38:14.999 --> 00:38:16.759]  Members of Congress can't fly.
[00:38:16.859 --> 00:38:18.700]  This is not by accident, folks.
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:20.040]  This is government harassment.
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:32.683]  For more than a year and a half, Representative John Lewis has endured lengthy delays at the ticket counter, intense questioning by airline employees, and suspicious glances by fellow passengers.
[00:38:33.263 --> 00:38:34.883]  Airport security guards have
[00:38:35.689 --> 00:38:40.514]  Combed through his luggage as he stood in front of his constituents at the Atlanta airport.
[00:38:40.994 --> 00:38:46.019]  An airline employee has paged him on board a flight for further questioning, he said.
[00:38:46.039 --> 00:38:58.651]  On at least 35 occasions, the Georgia Democrat said he was treated like a criminal because his name, like that of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Mass, appeared on the government terrorist watch list.
[00:38:59.574 --> 00:39:07.640]  Although Kennedy managed to get security officials to end his airline hassles after three weeks of trying, Lewis had no luck for months.
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:11.683]  Then he found his own way around the security mess.
[00:39:12.524 --> 00:39:17.007]  Lewis added his middle initial to the name when making his airline reservations.
[00:39:17.347 --> 00:39:25.173]  The computer system apparently didn't flag tickets for Representative John R. Lewis, and the hassle suddenly ended.
[00:39:25.811 --> 00:39:30.774]  The R is the only thing that has been saving me, Lewis said, from Atlanta Friday.
[00:39:31.294 --> 00:39:45.803]  Hundreds of passengers, possibly thousands, hundreds of thousands are on the list, folks, have contacted the Transportation Security Administration complaining that the government's secret watch list are unfairly targeting innocent travelers and causing travel headaches.
[00:39:46.143 --> 00:39:50.906]  Just last month, more than 250 passengers sought to be removed from the list.
[00:39:51.766 --> 00:39:53.327]  But even more disconnecting
[00:39:54.702 --> 00:39:55.482]  Disconcerting.
[00:39:55.962 --> 00:40:04.105]  Some of these travelers, and security experts say, is the system can be easily circumvented by a simple adjustment to one's name.
[00:40:04.505 --> 00:40:10.567]  The no-fly list assumes that dangerous people are going to use the same name the government thinks they use.
[00:40:11.027 --> 00:40:19.069]  If I'm Osama Bin Bush, I mean Bin Laden, I mean Al-Qaeda, I'm going to use a fake ID when I go to an airline for a hijack.
[00:40:19.844 --> 00:40:23.125]  said Aaron H. Kaplan, attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union.
[00:40:23.145 --> 00:40:31.327]  The whole notion that keeping a list of names contributes to safety is kind of questionable, especially when terrorists use aliases all the time.
[00:40:31.827 --> 00:40:45.010]  Some passengers who were told that their names matched others on the watch list said they have been tipped off by airline employees who were embarrassed and apologetic about having to delay them when the passengers were known to the employees.
[00:40:47.131 --> 00:40:48.111]  Folks, that's the point.
[00:40:49.804 --> 00:40:54.526]  What, 10 members of Al-Qaeda, known members, traveled to Malaysia a year before 9-11?
[00:40:55.647 --> 00:41:00.729]  And then the State Department, the Customs Department, wouldn't let them back in?
[00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:05.832]  And so the CIA called, this is admitted, and said, let them back in?
[00:41:08.533 --> 00:41:09.473]  It's ridiculous!
[00:41:10.714 --> 00:41:13.515]  I mean, we talk about going after those that fund and train Al-Qaeda.
[00:41:13.655 --> 00:41:15.076]  Our government, admittedly,
[00:41:16.664 --> 00:41:19.686]  has paid for their homes, their cars, their credit cards.
[00:41:19.886 --> 00:41:21.107]  It's public.
[00:41:22.247 --> 00:41:24.249]  They get trained at US military bases.
[00:41:24.289 --> 00:41:25.849]  They have CIA pass.
[00:41:25.889 --> 00:41:27.350]  They're protected.
[00:41:28.971 --> 00:41:36.095]  But as citizens, we're being put into a system where we're all tracked and traced and arbitrarily can quote, lose our privileges.
[00:41:36.836 --> 00:41:39.117]  Rodney in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:41:39.598 --> 00:41:41.178]  I got a couple of comments.
[00:41:41.679 --> 00:41:43.340]  First of all, I think it's time for
[00:41:44.252 --> 00:41:48.795]  Don Lewis and Edward Kennedy and you and I to go out and get a matricula card, don't you think?
[00:41:50.537 --> 00:41:51.958]  Well that's really the answer.
[00:41:52.558 --> 00:41:58.583]  Over 850 cities last time I checked a year ago accept the matricula card which
[00:41:59.481 --> 00:42:02.364]  We had the leader of the Republican Senate on last year.
[00:42:02.944 --> 00:42:12.111]  He was able to go get four different fake matricular cards and sell them in a test, paying about $25 a piece for them.
[00:42:12.692 --> 00:42:13.932]  And I've sat there and watched it.
[00:42:14.093 --> 00:42:15.133]  I'm at my own bank.
[00:42:15.173 --> 00:42:16.835]  They want two forms of ID.
[00:42:16.855 --> 00:42:23.360]  And I watch an illegal alien walk up, give nothing out, no ID, cash checks, do whatever you want.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:29.752]  It's like a lady I know who manages the biggest apartment complex in Austin for the biggest apartment company in the nation.
[00:42:30.393 --> 00:42:32.297]  Last Christmas she went to the meeting.
[00:42:33.274 --> 00:42:41.457]  In Dallas, and they were told, if citizens, black, white, Hispanic, have too many people in their apartment, fine them, fee them, kick them out.
[00:42:41.898 --> 00:42:44.999]  But if they're illegal aliens, you let them have 10 to an apartment.
[00:42:45.359 --> 00:42:46.259]  And they said, why?
[00:42:46.279 --> 00:42:48.320]  And they said, we've been told to do this by the government.
[00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:54.523]  They're setting up an economic system to destroy the middle class and to undermine things.
[00:42:54.543 --> 00:42:56.824]  That's why they give more welfare, more
[00:42:59.255 --> 00:43:08.960]  Basically grease the skids for illegals to magnet in tens of millions of these people to drive down the wages to bring in this voting bloc.
[00:43:09.241 --> 00:43:13.483]  And for those that are denying what I'm saying, we saw it publicly this year, George Bush
[00:43:15.274 --> 00:43:18.216]  Says that if you're a citizen leaving, you've got to thumb scan and face scan.
[00:43:18.236 --> 00:43:21.237]  If you're a Canadian coming in, if you're an African coming in, you have to.
[00:43:21.257 --> 00:43:23.659]  If you're a Chinese, a Russian, whatever.
[00:43:24.219 --> 00:43:27.921]  But if you're from Latin America, you don't have to face scan and thumb scan.
[00:43:28.341 --> 00:43:32.003]  Now you get 30 days in the country just to walk right on in.
[00:43:32.103 --> 00:43:33.404]  Why cross the desert?
[00:43:34.484 --> 00:43:35.385]  But it gets worse.
[00:43:36.321 --> 00:43:46.228]  Then Bush came out and said, it's not an amnesty, it's just a total amnesty over the next six years, and we're going to pay with subsidies to bring unskilled workers here.
[00:43:46.248 --> 00:43:47.769]  Now, everybody heard that.
[00:43:48.209 --> 00:43:52.392]  So see, they get more rights and incentives than citizens.
[00:43:52.432 --> 00:43:52.812]  Go ahead.
[00:43:53.573 --> 00:43:59.477]  Yeah, so basically what you're saying is this thing with Homeland Security is nothing but a joke.
[00:43:59.557 --> 00:44:02.519]  It's just security against American citizens.
[00:44:03.582 --> 00:44:04.424]  Exactly.
[00:44:04.484 --> 00:44:06.527]  Everything I just laid out is mainstream news.
[00:44:06.568 --> 00:44:08.010]  People can check it out for themselves.
[00:44:08.751 --> 00:44:14.982]  How do we accept, and the federal government will come into a state and lobby against a group with their filing matricula card.
[00:44:15.323 --> 00:44:16.305]  The feds are behind it.
[00:44:17.023 --> 00:44:19.225]  I don't even blame Mexico or the Mexican people.
[00:44:19.285 --> 00:44:20.266]  It's a better life here.
[00:44:20.587 --> 00:44:21.347]  What do you expect?
[00:44:21.408 --> 00:44:23.329]  But why do they give more welfare?
[00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:25.251]  Why do they give more tuition?
[00:44:25.352 --> 00:44:27.374]  Why do they accept matricular cards?
[00:44:27.694 --> 00:44:31.258]  Why do they exempt Latin Americans from stuff that citizens have to do?
[00:44:31.898 --> 00:44:34.100]  And yet, a lot of Americans
[00:44:35.301 --> 00:44:38.422]  Aren't upset about this and we're the ones who are splitting the bill.
[00:44:38.942 --> 00:44:39.963]  Am I correct or what?
[00:44:40.363 --> 00:44:41.343]  Of course you're correct!
[00:44:41.423 --> 00:44:58.529]  And now, merging with the Pan-American Union, the Union of American States, the Free Trade Area of the Americas, that nobody seems to even know about, we're going to have our Social Security, our law enforcement, our roads, everything merged, and they're saying they're going to build the new Capitol in Miami or Atlanta.
[00:44:59.216 --> 00:45:06.819]  And this goes into law next year, and again, 90% of people I talk to have never even heard of it, Rodney.
[00:45:08.039 --> 00:45:10.580]  Alex, you were talking about antidepressants.
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.080]  I'm kind of jumping around here.
[00:45:12.461 --> 00:45:25.765]  Just a while ago, last month in the Miami Herald, they ran a story about these 13 and 14 year old teenage boys that had been placed on antidepressants that had been developed and manufactured by Johnson & Johnson.
[00:45:26.502 --> 00:45:36.105]  And it had been approved by the FDA, but they had told Johnson & Johnson that they had changed the labeling because it was causing a lot of harm to these young boys.
[00:45:36.145 --> 00:45:44.327]  It was an antidepressant, but one of the side effects was it was causing these young boys to develop breast and breast milk.
[00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:47.131]  Did you ever get a chance to read that article?
[00:45:47.151 --> 00:46:04.041]  Yeah, I did see that article, and there's hundreds of these things now, and they literally cause all sorts of health problems, psychotic breaks, and when you go on the drugs and you get more depressed, they have you come back and they put you on even more drugs.
[00:46:04.722 --> 00:46:08.624]  Okay, just one other thing regarding pharmaceutical companies.
[00:46:08.644 --> 00:46:09.645]  Just yesterday, St.
[00:46:10.305 --> 00:46:11.686]  Paul Pioneer Press
[00:46:12.295 --> 00:46:15.738]  I'm reading an article that was talking about Merck Pharmaceuticals.
[00:46:16.218 --> 00:46:27.327]  George Merck, he has a history that goes all the way back to Nazi concentration camps when they were using the Jews and others in those camps as a human guinea pig.
[00:46:27.808 --> 00:46:37.636]  Sir, Merck, IBM, just all these people, I mean I was in an elevator the other day and it said ThyssenKrump.
[00:46:38.126 --> 00:46:40.747]  You know, both the big Nazi families that funded the Bushes.
[00:46:41.127 --> 00:46:42.208]  Thanks for the call, Rodney.
[00:46:42.768 --> 00:46:45.389]  Yeah, it's just incredible when you know history.
[00:46:45.489 --> 00:46:46.650]  It's all around us.
[00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:49.071]  But real Nazis are okay.
[00:46:49.731 --> 00:47:01.096]  Again, if you're Arnold Schwarzenegger and say you love Hitler and you love Kurt Voltheim and don't care if they're Nazis and you hate black people and, you know, they're the N-word and you say it in public, you're good.
[00:47:01.156 --> 00:47:02.237]  You get awards.
[00:47:03.624 --> 00:47:04.665]  We're fighting racism.
[00:47:05.145 --> 00:47:11.770]  If you fight racism and you fight the New World Order, you are listed as an anti-semitic racist.
[00:47:12.571 --> 00:47:13.492]  I'm not joking.
[00:47:14.112 --> 00:47:16.894]  Up is down, down is up, black is white, white is black.
[00:47:16.934 --> 00:47:17.635]  It's double think.
[00:47:17.955 --> 00:47:18.075]  It's 1984.
[00:47:18.836 --> 00:47:20.337]  Ray in Denver.
[00:47:20.357 --> 00:47:20.977]  Thanks for holding.
[00:47:20.997 --> 00:47:21.618]  Go ahead, Ray.
[00:47:22.238 --> 00:47:22.879]  Hello, Alex.
[00:47:22.919 --> 00:47:23.639]  How are you doing today?
[00:47:23.679 --> 00:47:24.140]  Good, sir.
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:26.862]  Alex, I've got a couple of quick things.
[00:47:27.983 --> 00:47:29.024]  One of them is this.
[00:47:30.565 --> 00:47:33.307]  Why does not someone
[00:47:34.181 --> 00:47:51.031]  Get a lawsuit going against not only George Bush but every single politician who is not enforcing the protection of our borders.
[00:47:51.331 --> 00:48:02.197]  There are hundreds of individual state lawsuits, lawsuits over money, I mean the government has our money to fight the lawsuits with and they own the judges.
[00:48:03.677 --> 00:48:04.898]  There are hundreds of lawsuits.
[00:48:05.618 --> 00:48:16.201]  Okay, the other thing is, why do we pay politicians a full-time salary when it's clear that they're only part-time employees?
[00:48:16.241 --> 00:48:21.222]  Well, hey, members of Congress have multi-million dollar pensions and don't even pay into Social Security.
[00:48:21.482 --> 00:48:27.704]  Did you know that there are hundreds of laws I know of where congressmen and women exempt themselves from the laws we have to follow?
[00:48:28.264 --> 00:48:30.545]  Yeah, yeah, and what I'm talking about is
[00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:35.333]  George Bush, John Kerry, just two examples that are going right now.
[00:48:36.033 --> 00:48:37.374]  And it has nothing to do with them.
[00:48:37.434 --> 00:48:42.258]  It has to do with the fact that politicians are taking our money for a full-time job.
[00:48:42.939 --> 00:48:48.283]  Obviously, it's not a full-time job, or they wouldn't have time to go do this.
[00:48:48.404 --> 00:48:57.591]  Now, either these jobs of President of the United States and Senator of the United States is a full-time job, and this is very important, or it isn't.
[00:48:57.931 --> 00:48:59.593]  And you can't have it both ways.
[00:49:00.285 --> 00:49:02.687]  I hear you, Ray, and I appreciate the good points you made.
[00:49:02.727 --> 00:49:13.418]  Look, if you think the $280,000 that a president gets has anything to do with why they're there, look at the average person who becomes a congressman.
[00:49:16.391 --> 00:49:20.594]  Two to four years, you look at most of them, they become multi-millionaires from nothing.
[00:49:20.894 --> 00:49:26.338]  If they weren't millionaires or billionaires to begin with, you look at presidents and how their wealth explodes.
[00:49:26.438 --> 00:49:27.939]  One example was LBJ.
[00:49:28.339 --> 00:49:34.243]  He was worth like a million bucks when he became president and worth hundreds of millions when he left.
[00:49:34.923 --> 00:49:40.047]  I mean, it's pretty obvious what they're up to and what they're doing and all the different payoffs they get on the side.
[00:49:46.918 --> 00:49:51.742]  They have no full-time job.
[00:49:52.963 --> 00:50:01.890]  It's not as important as everyone thinks it is, or else they could not take all of this time off from that important job.
[00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:08.475]  I was in the Army for 20 years, and by God, I couldn't take time off from my job at different points.
[00:50:08.755 --> 00:50:09.176]  I hear you.
[00:50:09.196 --> 00:50:10.216]  Thank you for the call, Ray.
[00:50:10.577 --> 00:50:11.597]  I appreciate the call.
[00:50:12.098 --> 00:50:15.901]  Look, I've talked a lot about this, okay?
[00:50:17.276 --> 00:50:18.817]  The Presidents are puppets.
[00:50:19.017 --> 00:50:20.557]  They don't run anything.
[00:50:20.637 --> 00:50:27.319]  It's the people that put them into power, it's the cabinets that surround them, and it's who that cabinet reports to.
[00:50:27.979 --> 00:50:39.163]  It's the different non-governmental boards that they sit on that administer things for the owners of the planet that are the globalists, that are the New World Order, that are the Illuminati.
[00:50:40.663 --> 00:50:42.664]  Or whatever name you call them, they're still the same.
[00:50:43.445 --> 00:50:46.548]  Alright, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com are the websites.
[00:50:46.989 --> 00:50:51.734]  A lot of other news, Michelle Malkin in defensive concentration camps, she'll be joining us.
[00:50:52.495 --> 00:50:54.317]  And much more, so please stay with us.
[00:51:00.944 --> 00:51:03.807]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[00:51:04.526 --> 00:51:05.807]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:51:06.007 --> 00:51:11.732]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:51:12.033 --> 00:51:17.297]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:51:17.578 --> 00:51:21.741]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:51:21.921 --> 00:51:25.665]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:51:25.945 --> 00:51:30.529]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:51:30.649 --> 00:51:36.912]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:51:36.952 --> 00:51:38.853]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:51:39.273 --> 00:51:41.354]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny today.
[00:51:41.434 --> 00:51:45.716]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:45.796 --> 00:51:46.377]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:47.317 --> 00:51:52.980]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:55.081]  You see, big brothers are afraid of this documentary.
[00:51:55.301 --> 00:51:56.842]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:51:57.002 --> 00:51:59.103]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:52:00.131 --> 00:52:05.357]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:52:05.497 --> 00:52:13.607]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:52:13.867 --> 00:52:20.915]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:52:21.095 --> 00:52:22.376]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:52:22.456 --> 00:52:28.342]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:52:28.543 --> 00:52:33.628]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:52:33.748 --> 00:52:42.577]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.

[00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:48.911]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:49.091 --> 00:53:54.956]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:07.523 --> 00:54:12.606]  Yeah, Michelle Malkin has written this book in defense of internment camps.
[00:54:14.608 --> 00:54:27.816]  And whenever I want to get a ultra-liberal, big government, fascist pimp on the show, like, oh, for instance, Ann Coulter, I have to keep it secret.
[00:54:29.437 --> 00:54:35.941]  And a lot of times you've got to tell them that, oh, it's Emmerich Jones once you on, because they all know who I am and are deathly afraid of me.
[00:54:36.830 --> 00:54:39.171]  And she cancelled on us last minute.
[00:54:40.312 --> 00:55:01.461]  We're trying to call her cell phone right now to see if we can get her on because I'd like to hear how the concentration camps are good and why we use them on Japanese and they would be good here for us and for those that commit crimes and we have lots of bills being introduced in Oregon and Rhode Island that would put people in camps for committing misdemeanors like Senate Bill 742
[00:55:04.494 --> 00:55:07.055]  But we'll see if we can get her lined back up.
[00:55:07.495 --> 00:55:09.136]  I know there's such a demand for her.
[00:55:09.176 --> 00:55:10.876]  I've seen her all over national television.
[00:55:11.677 --> 00:55:16.979]  She's out there promoting and then, you know, Sean Hannity has her on the TV and goes, you want camps?
[00:55:16.999 --> 00:55:18.079]  Man, that's a horrible idea.
[00:55:18.139 --> 00:55:19.760]  By the end of it, oh, I see your point.
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:20.600]  Makes a lot of sense.
[00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:30.564]  In these little staged events, when I've heard Hannity call for this stuff, he just puts on this little act like, I'm not for this at the first and by the end, ooh, I see your point.
[00:55:31.044 --> 00:55:33.805]  We got Michael Savage saying if you disagree with the government,
[00:55:34.344 --> 00:55:37.305]  That age tariff and you should be put in a forced labor camp.
[00:55:37.985 --> 00:55:40.826]  And we have all these generals talking about martial law.
[00:55:40.886 --> 00:55:43.127]  It's just being introduced to us.
[00:55:45.188 --> 00:55:45.928]  Just amazing.
[00:55:47.048 --> 00:55:53.551]  But I was going to read to her this Abu Ghraib article out of ABC News about people being tortured until they pass out.
[00:55:54.351 --> 00:55:58.572]  And then the doctors come and administer drugs to wake them back up for torture.
[00:55:59.293 --> 00:56:00.313]  For more torture!
[00:56:01.233 --> 00:56:02.774]  Somebody passes out from pain,
[00:56:03.644 --> 00:56:05.566]  Well, we've got ways of making you talk.
[00:56:05.786 --> 00:56:12.172]  And of course, 70-90% of those taken to these camps are families picked up at checkpoints and they are tortured.
[00:56:13.173 --> 00:56:18.378]  There's 32 camps in Iraq alone and of course, Camp X-Ray, it's admitted too, what's happened there.
[00:56:18.418 --> 00:56:26.626]  So we'll go over this and talk about concentration camps and talk about torture and talk about how it's now all right out in the open for you and your family.
[00:56:28.542 --> 00:56:39.348]  But I guess because Malkin's not there, that gives me more time to go to Trucker Kenny and Michael and Carl and Karma and everybody else that's patiently holding.
[00:56:39.388 --> 00:56:44.431]  So we'll go to your calls immediately when we start the second hour and get into all this other news as well.
[00:56:45.311 --> 00:56:46.572]  We do have Paul Watson coming up.
[00:56:47.373 --> 00:57:02.088]  But before I end this hour, I do just want to briefly at the end here remind all of you that if you want to support what we're doing, and you want tools that will wake up 90% of those that see the films, that you need to have my videos.
[00:57:02.228 --> 00:57:03.069]  I've made 10 of them.
[00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:04.771]  They're all over 2 hours long.
[00:57:06.181 --> 00:57:14.127]  They're very professionally produced, they're fast moving, full of documentation, they expose the New World Order from every angle.
[00:57:14.747 --> 00:57:25.655]  So again, infowars.com or prisonplanet.com, that's infowars.com or prisonplanet.com

[00:58:11.726 --> 00:58:14.308]  And it comes with an 80-plus page color booklet.
[00:58:15.642 --> 00:58:19.043]  9-11 The Great Illusion booklet along with a VHS or DVD.

[00:58:48.384 --> 00:58:49.045]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:58.092 --> 00:58:58.772]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.413 --> 00:59:00.374]  Mainstream Media.
[00:59:01.167 --> 00:59:02.267]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.907 --> 00:59:03.768]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.488 --> 00:59:05.428]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.068 --> 00:59:09.929]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.249 --> 00:59:14.370]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.751 --> 00:59:28.353]  Well, our concentration camp babe, you know, kind of like the STP girl at the, uh, Indy 500 or NASCAR,
[00:59:30.962 --> 00:59:35.143]  We don't have, you know, the pretty girl in the bathing suit anymore for stuff like that.
[00:59:35.163 --> 00:59:35.943]  I mean, we still do.
[00:59:35.963 --> 00:59:43.445]  No, no, we have the pretty girls pushing, arresting anybody that disagrees with the government, putting people in concentration camps.
[00:59:44.025 --> 00:59:47.446]  Oh, Michelle Malkin, we just talked her on the phone and she just can't come on.
[00:59:47.526 --> 00:59:48.726]  She just isn't going to.
[00:59:49.546 --> 00:59:56.788]  She doesn't want to defend her concentration camp book about how wonderful concentration camps are, an argument for internment camps.
[00:59:57.535 --> 01:00:00.097]  The case for internment camps is the name of the brag.
[01:00:00.637 --> 01:00:02.078]  I hope you don't spend any money on it.
[01:00:03.299 --> 01:00:09.643]  It's not even worthy of being used as birdcage liner, folks.
[01:00:10.964 --> 01:00:11.284]  I don't know.
[01:00:11.324 --> 01:00:13.065]  You should know the mindset of these people.
[01:00:14.166 --> 01:00:15.067]  It's disgusting.
[01:00:16.127 --> 01:00:17.048]  They want power.
[01:00:17.108 --> 01:00:18.089]  They want control.
[01:00:18.149 --> 01:00:19.089]  They want to dominate.
[01:00:19.149 --> 01:00:20.630]  That's the norm in human history.
[01:00:21.091 --> 01:00:22.772]  And now it's happening here in America.
[01:00:23.092 --> 01:00:24.453]  And it's so sad, folks.
[01:00:25.276 --> 01:00:27.277]  Let's go ahead and we got Paul Watson coming up.
[01:00:27.317 --> 01:00:28.457]  Let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[01:00:29.618 --> 01:00:34.080]  Let's talk to old Trucker Kenny who's in Wisconsin.
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.440]  Go ahead Trucker Kenny.
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:36.981]  Good morning Alex.
[01:00:37.161 --> 01:00:37.561]  Hello.
[01:00:37.821 --> 01:00:40.982]  Is Paul Joseph Watson listening at this moment?
[01:00:41.362 --> 01:00:41.763]  I don't know.
[01:00:42.083 --> 01:00:43.603]  He's going to be a guest in the next hour.
[01:00:43.803 --> 01:00:52.807]  This will be informational regarding the UK and I went to your search engine just on your site
[01:00:53.493 --> 01:01:00.379]  I want to bring this to your attention and the listeners attention about what the UK wants to do.
[01:01:00.439 --> 01:01:03.962]  Have you heard of the Tetra system, the Tetra Towers?
[01:01:04.382 --> 01:01:04.722]  Yes.
[01:01:05.463 --> 01:01:21.376]  Okay, well I went to, I use a mama.com search engine and for those that want to type in Tetra Towers, T-E-T-R-A Towers forward slash mind control this will go right to the issue Alex of
[01:01:21.983 --> 01:01:41.048]  Command Control Track and Trace operating on a 17.6 Hertz range and also in some of the UK articles on those websites that the search engine will recover is that the issue with Greece, Cyprus and Turkey
[01:01:41.954 --> 01:01:47.077]  Where is indicated on one of the websites that 11.3 Hertz.
[01:01:47.437 --> 01:01:51.359]  Okay, sir, you're going to need to give folks a little bit of background on what you're talking about.
[01:01:51.379 --> 01:01:55.901]  Greece and Turkey and different Hertz and Tetra Towers.
[01:01:55.961 --> 01:01:57.722]  Why don't you break it down for folks?
[01:01:57.902 --> 01:02:07.187]  Okay, the Tetra Towers system, the British government, well the UK wants to spend, I believe it was two and a half billion pounds to erect 30,000 towers.
[01:02:09.637 --> 01:02:14.540]  For what they call police communications and so on.
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:21.723]  But upon further looking into the issue, Alex, it appears it's going to be used for mind control.
[01:02:22.124 --> 01:02:29.708]  And for those who don't believe that, in the article I wrote, DARPA Engineering the Beast System, just type that into a search engine and it'll pop up.
[01:02:30.248 --> 01:02:32.249]  We have links to every statement I make.
[01:02:33.076 --> 01:02:40.339]  The Boston Globe last year came out and said, DARPA just doesn't want these new surveillance towers to watch you.
[01:02:41.119 --> 01:02:48.601]  They have patented waves they can send out to make you sick, to make you happy, to even kill you.
[01:02:48.621 --> 01:02:52.483]  And they admit, DARPA told them that they're going to deploy this here.
[01:02:52.943 --> 01:02:55.824]  And then see, once we have it, we're not going to feel bad anymore.
[01:02:55.864 --> 01:02:57.945]  We're going to love the new World Order, Trucker Kenny.
[01:02:58.285 --> 01:02:58.685]  But again,
[01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:04.069]  For folks that don't believe this, you'll hear it mainstream news in two years on the nightly news how great it is.
[01:03:05.627 --> 01:03:10.328]  Folks laughed at me a couple years ago when I said the cops are going to be forced to take chips, the prisoners.
[01:03:10.728 --> 01:03:12.448]  Now it's happening in multiple countries.
[01:03:12.748 --> 01:03:15.389]  They're going to be on the news saying take all the microchips.
[01:03:15.789 --> 01:03:18.129]  They're going to be on the news saying we're going to secretly arrest you.
[01:03:18.529 --> 01:03:20.270]  Now all of that is mainstream.
[01:03:20.350 --> 01:03:21.930]  Martial law is mainstream.
[01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:25.311]  Concentration camps are good and are mainstream.
[01:03:25.771 --> 01:03:32.772]  And yes, DARPA says they're going to openly put up towers and once they turn them on, Trucker Kenny, we're going to love the New World Order.
[01:03:33.524 --> 01:03:46.662]  Yes, Alex, and also if they want to go to Carnicom's website, carnicom.com, and look at the harp issue and how that factors into as a vector for electromagnetic advance.
[01:03:47.203 --> 01:03:47.623]  I hear you.
[01:03:47.884 --> 01:03:48.484]  Good points.
[01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:49.346]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:49.386 --> 01:03:50.227]  More calls coming up.
[01:03:55.177 --> 01:04:00.658]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:04:01.098 --> 01:04:05.639]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:12.601]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:04:12.961 --> 01:04:19.083]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:04:19.223 --> 01:04:20.423]  There are no side effects.
[01:04:20.783 --> 01:04:23.726]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:04:23.887 --> 01:04:24.788]  Eliminate the cost.
[01:04:24.848 --> 01:04:25.909]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:04:26.209 --> 01:04:33.457]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:04:33.757 --> 01:04:37.141]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:04:37.561 --> 01:04:44.206]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[01:04:44.226 --> 01:04:45.827]  866-885-6625.
[01:04:45.847 --> 01:04:47.368]  866-885-6625.
[01:04:47.628 --> 01:04:51.171]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:04:51.251 --> 01:04:51.871]  Call today.
[01:04:52.552 --> 01:04:56.895]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:04:57.075 --> 01:05:01.418]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:05:03.925 --> 01:05:06.028]  What's this disaster for the New World Order?
[01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:08.931]  The New World Order can emerge.
[01:05:09.171 --> 01:05:13.397]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:05:13.457 --> 01:05:20.405]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:05:20.525 --> 01:05:22.528]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:05:22.768 --> 01:05:33.357]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:05:33.517 --> 01:05:38.921]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:43.305]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order, or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[01:05:43.785 --> 01:05:45.587]  Order today and spread the word!
[01:05:52.012 --> 01:06:00.634]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:06:00.854 --> 01:06:12.117]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:06:12.337 --> 01:06:14.998]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:06:15.338 --> 01:06:19.439]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[01:06:19.639 --> 01:06:21.780]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:23.821]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:06:24.021 --> 01:06:30.044]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:06:30.284 --> 01:06:35.947]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[01:06:40.971 --> 01:06:42.012]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:06:42.112 --> 01:06:43.934]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:44.274 --> 01:06:45.956]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:04.816 --> 01:07:07.939]  All right, back live, folks, continuing with your phone calls.
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:11.021]  I just want to make a comment about the last caller.
[01:07:11.561 --> 01:07:24.552]  Kenny in Wisconsin brought up how the government is deploying all of these high-powered towers with just huge electrical connections to them.
[01:07:25.492 --> 01:07:33.759]  And there is, from the 50s, patented waves, electronic waves that can be sent off that can control the mind.
[01:07:34.631 --> 01:07:47.953]  That is, I mean, they can't make you, you know, go start your car and drive to Albuquerque, New Mexico, but they can make you throw up, feel giddy, get sick, have a stroke.
[01:07:49.854 --> 01:07:57.715]  It's like these microwave guns that they've quietly deployed over the last three years, even before 9-11, to all the major police departments.
[01:07:58.615 --> 01:08:03.296]  And they can turn it down on low and just burn your skin, or turn it up on high and fry you!
[01:08:03.982 --> 01:08:06.543]  High-powered microwave guns, a huge dish.
[01:08:07.683 --> 01:08:21.626]  They deploy these sound weapons that can burst your eardrums to Iraq, and I said, folks, the police have quietly already gotten these systems, and lo and behold, Associated Press last Friday, sound weapons to be used against the population.
[01:08:23.207 --> 01:08:26.487]  But sound weapons against protesters is one thing.
[01:08:28.628 --> 01:08:29.408]  That's one thing.
[01:08:30.587 --> 01:08:33.869]  Another are machines that will control your mind.
[01:08:33.929 --> 01:08:41.333]  And they say, well, for security on DARPA, the Pentagon wants to put this up in America.
[01:08:41.414 --> 01:08:46.797]  I mean, again, it's like I woke it up into an Outer Limits, Twilight Zone episode.
[01:08:46.977 --> 01:08:48.138]  I can't believe this.
[01:08:48.598 --> 01:08:55.582]  I can't believe 160 Mexican judicial workers to be able to get into the Justice Department all had to take chips.
[01:08:56.022 --> 01:08:56.522]  And now it's 300.
[01:08:57.663 --> 01:09:00.885]  Now another hundred and something got it.
[01:09:00.925 --> 01:09:03.727]  Now they're saying they may make all the police take it.
[01:09:04.047 --> 01:09:05.508]  And this is mainstream news.
[01:09:06.088 --> 01:09:13.573]  There's mainstream articles every day about how great it is and how money will soon be replaced with a chip.
[01:09:13.693 --> 01:09:17.936]  And in Time Magazine for kids, every issue I see has this in it.
[01:09:17.976 --> 01:09:20.377]  And the children's shows have it in them.
[01:09:20.437 --> 01:09:21.478]  And just everywhere!
[01:09:22.182 --> 01:09:33.049]  I mean, I could run down the street pulling my hair out, screaming, and that would be more of a normal response to all of this than people that just say, eh, big deal.
[01:09:35.831 --> 01:09:42.895]  And it'd be one thing if our government was loving and good and compassionate and, oh, we just want this for you because we're angels and this will stop any problems.
[01:09:43.936 --> 01:09:45.657]  Those type of governments don't exist.
[01:09:48.323 --> 01:09:52.887]  Out of the different types of governments that exist, we've got one of the worst I could imagine.
[01:09:53.968 --> 01:09:55.549]  And I don't mean George Bush, folks.
[01:09:55.589 --> 01:09:56.590]  He's a total puppet.
[01:09:57.691 --> 01:10:10.262]  There's no difference between George Bush and John Kerry other than the Bush tax cut, which was small for the average person, quite large for the middle class, and huge for rich people.
[01:10:10.962 --> 01:10:12.864]  And frankly, I have no problem with tax cuts.
[01:10:12.904 --> 01:10:13.845]  I always think they're good.
[01:10:14.597 --> 01:10:23.161]  But we have a giant ballooning government, and so that's what Republicans and Democrats do, is Republicans get us deeper into debt, and then Democrats jack up our taxes.
[01:10:23.221 --> 01:10:24.901]  But that's really the only difference.
[01:10:25.522 --> 01:10:26.942]  All right, I'm off on a tirade.
[01:10:26.962 --> 01:10:27.763]  Let's go to calls.
[01:10:28.723 --> 01:10:30.224]  Michael in South Carolina.
[01:10:30.284 --> 01:10:31.164]  Michael, go ahead.
[01:10:31.424 --> 01:10:32.285]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:10:32.925 --> 01:10:33.285]  Good, sir.
[01:10:34.406 --> 01:10:39.888]  I was looking around the Drudge Report the other day, and they had a headline that read, I was on Bin Laden's trail.
[01:10:40.508 --> 01:10:42.169]  And it's an AP News article.
[01:10:42.788 --> 01:10:50.051]  Yeah, that's the guy that one of the people they're charging with torture, he got up and said, look, I was working for the U.S.
[01:10:50.071 --> 01:10:53.372]  government, I was about to bust Bin Laden and they grabbed me.
[01:10:54.452 --> 01:11:00.454]  Now, I wouldn't buy that story if we didn't have articles from before 9-11 with Bin Laden
[01:11:02.962 --> 01:11:15.949]  uh... in dubai at the american hospital with the cia uh... six months before that a bbc one telegraph articles where british ambassadors came back and said we were on the afghan pakistan border in u.s.
[01:11:15.989 --> 01:11:31.117]  special forces were at a compound guarding bin laden uh... you know we have that in special forces colonels hadn't been in the san francisco chronicle and in reuters saying we had al-qaeda cornered will you turn your radio off please
[01:11:32.485 --> 01:11:32.591]  Um...
[01:11:35.794 --> 01:11:45.680]  Special Forces Colonels saying we have Al Qaeda and Taliban 8000 cornered and they're ordered back off and they watch hundreds of helicopters land, U.S.
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:12:01.770]  helicopters and the article said black folks, that's special ops, super secret FEMA, you know, type operators or lower level secret like Delta Force, that's not as high as it goes folks, landed and then flew them to dozens of C-130s to be flown out of the country.
[01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:02.951]  Go ahead, Michael.
[01:12:04.075 --> 01:12:15.241]  Yeah, he says on there that he was 30 days from capturing this guy and he gave them the exact house he was at in Peshawar, Pakistan or whatever.
[01:12:15.261 --> 01:12:19.123]  He gave them the grid, the house number, everything.
[01:12:19.143 --> 01:12:26.447]  The FBI confirmed that they went there but they didn't go until five days later and he was already gone.
[01:12:26.507 --> 01:12:28.328]  It's almost like they don't even want to catch him.
[01:12:29.748 --> 01:12:30.969]  Which I found kind of interesting.
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:35.361]  Well, you know, that's how this story works.
[01:12:37.202 --> 01:12:50.207]  But, Bin Laden, according to my source, and I don't know if this is disinfo, but two and a half years ago, White House source, high-level, told me that Bin Laden died of kidney failure before 9-11.
[01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:58.670]  That he was handed over by the family, in turn, for big weapons contracts, which they've made billions off those alone, through the Carlisle Group.
[01:12:59.110 --> 01:13:01.751]  Yes, the Bin Ladens make money off the war, folks, it's true.
[01:13:02.578 --> 01:13:06.720]  Uh, and that he's been frozen ever since, and that they're going to roll him out right before the election.
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:11.261]  Now I said this could be disinfo, but then Madeleine Albright comes out and says it.
[01:13:11.341 --> 01:13:13.682]  Senator Grassley, a Republican, comes out and says it.
[01:13:14.203 --> 01:13:15.223]  All these people saying it.
[01:13:15.263 --> 01:13:16.403]  What do you think's happening, Michael?
[01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:18.564]  I don't know.
[01:13:18.624 --> 01:13:22.866]  I mean, it could be... I mean, you know, it's... I don't know.
[01:13:22.906 --> 01:13:24.106]  It could be anything, you know?
[01:13:24.807 --> 01:13:28.528]  They're definitely not going to... They're definitely not looking for him too hard, you know?
[01:13:28.708 --> 01:13:30.949]  Well, it's admitted historical fact, Michael.
[01:13:32.463 --> 01:13:34.364]  That our government created Al-Qaeda.
[01:13:34.944 --> 01:13:36.604]  That our government put the Taliban in.
[01:13:37.164 --> 01:13:38.165]  And that's not debatable.
[01:13:38.585 --> 01:13:40.165]  And people need to stop denying that.
[01:13:40.185 --> 01:13:43.706]  Alright, well, Alex, I appreciate it.
[01:13:43.726 --> 01:13:44.866]  I just want to let you know one more thing.
[01:13:45.046 --> 01:13:51.368]  I'm down here at Georgia Southern College here, and I'm trying to let the people know, but it's rather difficult.
[01:13:51.428 --> 01:13:53.289]  But I've gotten through to a few.
[01:13:53.989 --> 01:13:54.569]  Good job.
[01:13:54.589 --> 01:13:57.570]  It's people like you that are the backbone of this country.
[01:13:57.630 --> 01:13:58.310]  Take care, Michael.
[01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:02.812]  Carol and Carmine hung up, ladies.
[01:14:02.892 --> 01:14:06.636]  I like to talk to the ladies, so call me back at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:14:07.637 --> 01:14:09.698]  They hung up together.
[01:14:09.718 --> 01:14:11.000]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:14.663]  I like to hear from the women, not just the men.
[01:14:15.123 --> 01:14:16.344]  Who's up next, Jason?
[01:14:17.445 --> 01:14:18.927]  Ed in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[01:14:18.967 --> 01:14:19.367]  Go ahead.
[01:14:19.888 --> 01:14:23.571]  Alex, did you hear last week there was a microbiologist, a female.
[01:14:23.631 --> 01:14:25.713]  She was thrown in the trunk of a car.
[01:14:26.801 --> 01:14:28.202]  Yes, another one died.
[01:14:28.602 --> 01:14:30.003]  They get shot in the back of the head.
[01:14:30.043 --> 01:14:31.424]  They get their hearts cut out.
[01:14:31.484 --> 01:14:32.584]  That was in the Washington Post.
[01:14:32.925 --> 01:14:34.205]  They die in an inch of water.
[01:14:34.265 --> 01:14:35.566]  They fall out of high buildings.
[01:14:36.007 --> 01:14:42.290]  Cars jump the mediums and run over them and back, back over them in 15 mile an hour zones at universities.
[01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:43.751]  They die in airlocks.
[01:14:43.811 --> 01:14:45.332]  They die from biologicals.
[01:14:46.233 --> 01:14:47.954]  It's up to like 70 now.
[01:14:48.394 --> 01:14:53.157]  Well, she had her cell phone in her pocket, so she contacted her boyfriend, and by luck,
[01:14:54.329 --> 01:14:58.691]  Pulled a car over and she was alright and everything.
[01:14:59.131 --> 01:15:00.352]  So, how did she get in the trunk?
[01:15:00.992 --> 01:15:03.093]  Some guy grabbed her and threw her in the trunk of a car.
[01:15:04.573 --> 01:15:05.874]  I'm not sure if it was her car or what.
[01:15:06.474 --> 01:15:07.955]  Yeah, I saw that blurb.
[01:15:07.995 --> 01:15:08.755]  That's the problem.
[01:15:09.095 --> 01:15:11.416]  So much is happening, I can't even keep track of it anymore.
[01:15:11.436 --> 01:15:12.557]  That's why I love your calls.
[01:15:12.857 --> 01:15:14.297]  You take us in all these different directions.
[01:15:14.577 --> 01:15:17.379]  Now, why is the microbiologist story important?
[01:15:20.936 --> 01:15:27.305]  You know, any kind of anthrax attack or a smallpox attack, they're the people that, you know, don't understand what's going on and stuff.
[01:15:27.625 --> 01:15:28.266]  They're the experts.
[01:15:28.727 --> 01:15:29.247]  Exactly.
[01:15:29.307 --> 01:15:30.349]  Here's the scary part.
[01:15:31.875 --> 01:15:54.120]  The key people, the heads of their fields in Australia, Russia, the US, England, the head of Porton Down Bioweapons Lab, all these important people who developed the race-specific bioweapons, the weaponized anthrax, the weaponized smallpox, people that know how to treat it, that know how to identify who made it, they're all dying.
[01:15:55.261 --> 01:15:57.261]  They're all being killed.
[01:15:58.661 --> 01:16:00.642]  And it's very, very scary.
[01:16:02.737 --> 01:16:09.242]  I have the book from your network on how to survive a bio-nuclear attack and stuff.
[01:16:10.343 --> 01:16:12.444]  I've read it many times.
[01:16:12.464 --> 01:16:14.085]  It's very, very informative.
[01:16:14.946 --> 01:16:15.626]  Well, thank you, sir.
[01:16:15.666 --> 01:16:18.068]  I appreciate you supporting GCN Radio Network.
[01:16:19.049 --> 01:16:19.549]  Take care.
[01:16:20.850 --> 01:16:25.013]  Alright, I'll get to more of your calls coming up here after the break.
[01:16:26.574 --> 01:16:31.438]  Speaking of protecting Al-Qaeda, this is out of United Press International.
[01:16:32.719 --> 01:16:38.161]  Pakistan denies holding names of captured Al-Qaeda members until U.S.
[01:16:38.241 --> 01:16:38.741]  election.
[01:16:39.461 --> 01:16:47.123]  Pakistan said Sunday it still has no information about the whereabouts of Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden and his close associates.
[01:16:48.584 --> 01:16:54.466]  Pakistan is conducting a major operation against terror suspects in the country, arresting 63 people since July.
[01:16:55.086 --> 01:17:02.388]  Information Minister Shaqi Rasid Ahmed told a news briefing in Islamabad
[01:17:03.368 --> 01:17:08.613]  The Pakistani intelligence agencies had discovered an Al-Qaeda plot to bomb the U.S.
[01:17:08.693 --> 01:17:12.356]  Embassy, the President's home, and other key buildings in Islamabad.
[01:17:12.716 --> 01:17:16.600]  He said ten suspects were in custody, including some key Al-Qaeda operatives.
[01:17:17.225 --> 01:17:31.968]  Confirming these arrests, Pakistani Interior Minister Faisal Shahil Hayat said senior Al-Qaeda leaders such as Bin Laden and his deputy Aman al-Zahari were not among those arrested.
[01:17:31.988 --> 01:17:40.450]  He rejected news media reports as speculative that Pakistan had arrested some senior Al-Qaeda leaders and was planning to announce their names closer to the U.S.
[01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:40.890]  elections.
[01:17:41.290 --> 01:17:41.930]  Said Hayat,
[01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:43.612]  We have nothing to do with the U.S.
[01:17:43.652 --> 01:17:44.073]  elections.
[01:17:44.133 --> 01:17:50.002]  We are catching these suspects because we want to create a safe and peaceful Pakistan for future generations.
[01:17:52.025 --> 01:17:58.074]  Folks, the head of Pakistani intelligence met on the morning of 9-11 with Porter Goss and other intelligence heads.
[01:18:00.376 --> 01:18:05.298]  Pakistan, admittedly, was there helping the CIA fly out the Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders.
[01:18:05.358 --> 01:18:05.978]  That's admitted.
[01:18:06.338 --> 01:18:17.763]  And last year they had to admit that Musharraf, Peres Musharraf, the head of Pakistan, put in by our government by the way, staged a bombing against himself as an excuse to have crackdowns against the people.
[01:18:20.784 --> 01:18:21.524]  It's ridiculous!
[01:18:23.665 --> 01:18:29.647]  He drove over a bridge, had it bombed an hour after he left, and said, oh look, I'm under attack, and it turned out it was fake!
[01:18:30.379 --> 01:18:34.442]  Just like Putin blowing up his own apartment buildings to blame it on his political enemies.
[01:18:35.984 --> 01:18:37.685]  How much of this are we going to put up with?
[01:18:38.125 --> 01:18:41.028]  We'll take calls and we'll get into the latest Abu Ghraib torture.
[01:18:42.029 --> 01:18:43.770]  It gets worse and worse and worse.
[01:18:44.591 --> 01:18:47.333]  PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com are the websites.
[01:18:47.353 --> 01:18:48.734]  Don't forget to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:18:52.668 --> 01:18:53.429]  Terrorism!
[01:18:53.589 --> 01:18:54.329]  Terrorism!
[01:18:54.449 --> 01:19:00.513]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:19:00.753 --> 01:19:02.354]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:19:02.594 --> 01:19:05.076]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:19:05.456 --> 01:19:20.045]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:19:20.065 --> 01:19:20.405]  government.
[01:19:20.565 --> 01:19:22.366]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:19:22.726 --> 01:19:28.650]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:33.293]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[01:19:54.808 --> 01:19:57.390]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[01:19:57.570 --> 01:19:58.290]  You heard that right.
[01:19:58.490 --> 01:20:01.272]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[01:20:01.452 --> 01:20:02.713]  You don't have to pay them off.
[01:20:02.953 --> 01:20:04.354]  The banks are defrauding you.
[01:20:04.634 --> 01:20:05.975]  Now is the time to fight back.
[01:20:06.196 --> 01:20:08.777]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.

[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:52.902]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:20:53.082 --> 01:20:54.224]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:20:54.404 --> 01:20:57.829]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:20:57.929 --> 01:20:58.329]  Phenol!
[01:20:58.670 --> 01:21:05.739]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:10.163]  ETA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:21:10.283 --> 01:21:10.723]  Fragrance?
[01:21:11.103 --> 01:21:15.867]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:21:16.007 --> 01:21:20.690]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:23.412]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my CalBen shampoo.

[01:21:53.055 --> 01:21:54.835]  Jack Brownring for Midas Resources.
[01:21:55.336 --> 01:21:58.756]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[01:21:59.257 --> 01:21:59.917]  Let's update.
[01:22:00.437 --> 01:22:03.898]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[01:22:04.558 --> 01:22:08.279]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[01:22:08.939 --> 01:22:09.899]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[01:22:09.939 --> 01:22:12.260]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:13.680]  Today, the U.S.
[01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:15.941]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[01:22:16.321 --> 01:22:17.821]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[01:22:18.428 --> 01:22:20.409]  January of 02, gold spot was $283.
[01:22:21.769 --> 01:22:26.631]  January of 04, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[01:22:27.611 --> 01:22:29.772]  Gold is moving, equities are treading water.
[01:22:30.172 --> 01:22:32.733]  This is a little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[01:22:33.371 --> 01:22:34.752]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[01:22:35.192 --> 01:22:36.893]  Physical possession, private gold.
[01:22:37.313 --> 01:22:39.294]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.

[01:22:48.658 --> 01:22:59.483]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:00.124 --> 01:23:02.425]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.522]  Alright, let's go straight back to your calls.
[01:23:06.662 --> 01:23:08.623]  David in California, welcome.
[01:23:09.244 --> 01:23:10.785]  Hey, greetings Alex.
[01:23:10.925 --> 01:23:16.649]  It was good hearing you were talking about that woman with that horrible book about internment camps.
[01:23:18.030 --> 01:23:31.541]  That happened to raise my... The scariest book that I've got on my shelf right here is an old textbook from the old Appleton Century Publishing Company called The Economics of Total War by Henry William Spiegel.
[01:23:32.088 --> 01:23:47.943]  And it makes it really plain that the concept of total war is one in which the blank check that comes from fear, the taxpayers are always going to be beleaguered by these blank checks.
[01:23:48.443 --> 01:23:52.787]  Every time there's a new crisis, you have to write another blank check for each new crisis.
[01:23:53.308 --> 01:23:57.952]  And so every day that goes by that Bush comes up with a new crisis, he gets another blank check.
[01:23:58.604 --> 01:24:04.767]  And of course, in the name of top secrecy, you don't ever get a chance to do the auditing of these crises.
[01:24:05.268 --> 01:24:14.513]  And if they don't catch them, they can always claim, well, we nipped it in the bud and we didn't have to do all that we had to say about it.
[01:24:14.613 --> 01:24:17.294]  But we did spend the money, and we properly spent it.
[01:24:18.014 --> 01:24:20.756]  Well, your point's well taken, David.
[01:24:20.796 --> 01:24:22.237]  There's different types of economies.
[01:24:22.257 --> 01:24:26.219]  There's true free markets, there's socialists, there's communists, there's fascists.
[01:24:26.779 --> 01:24:34.167]  I would call this crony capitalism, where they socialize our wealth and then steal it in a fascistic pipeline.
[01:24:34.808 --> 01:24:43.797]  And this Homeland Security, New Domestic CIA, it's about engineering the entire economy through the coffers of the elite.
[01:24:44.237 --> 01:24:45.639]  Kind of like the Russian system.
[01:24:46.189 --> 01:25:00.789]  And in every case, China, Russia, African dictatorships, whatever, you get elites, and whatever name they give their system, it's all command and control, and the entire economy is fed through the hands of just a few oligarchs.
[01:25:01.289 --> 01:25:09.438]  And so that's the system we're going to, and they use the threat of crisis as the pretext to shut down all dissent, and that's exactly what's happening.
[01:25:09.658 --> 01:25:17.967]  And then we've got people like Savage and Milken, and all of them saying camps are good, secret arrests are good, your own Deputy Attorney General,
[01:25:19.364 --> 01:25:23.626]  Casperson, no Calhoun, came out in the newspaper last year.
[01:25:24.186 --> 01:25:30.089]  They're in Oakland and said, disagreeing with the government is aiding terrorists, you should be arrested, no protest allowed.
[01:25:30.589 --> 01:25:37.072]  I mean, across the political spectrum, John Kerry says he's for the war, he just debates how to prosecute it.
[01:25:37.292 --> 01:25:38.493]  There's no difference!
[01:25:38.933 --> 01:25:40.333]  Oh yeah, well that's the whole point.
[01:25:40.614 --> 01:25:44.415]  By the way, you know, they're running three layers of 9-1-1 hearings today.
[01:25:46.161 --> 01:25:50.604]  And I was watching one of the sessions about an hour or so ago, and a question came up.
[01:25:50.904 --> 01:26:06.635]  I don't know if you're very familiar with the Church Committee of, what, 15, 20 years ago, but one of the scandals that they had learned from the old CIA was that there were a lot of dirty people in there who were essentially using the taxpayers' money to do corporate spying.
[01:26:07.115 --> 01:26:16.021]  So, say, for example, General Motors wanted to spy on Volkswagen, they would use the CIA to essentially, you know, facilitate it.
[01:26:16.414 --> 01:26:28.421]  Well, nowadays, with all of these wiretaps that they've got on everybody, they essentially have figured out, and this came up really directly in the hearing this morning, that these wiretaps are good.
[01:26:28.942 --> 01:26:35.646]  Whether or not they can be justified under normal terrorism aspects, they can still use the information.
[01:26:36.086 --> 01:26:39.949]  Well, the point of it was that you can essentially, what was it?
[01:26:41.364 --> 01:26:51.092]  NSA is essentially monitoring every phone call that leaves and comes into America, as well as a good portion of the internet is spied upon.
[01:26:51.433 --> 01:27:02.602]  So all of these corporate transactions, whether it's their business accounts, whether it's their potential ad revenues or anything like that, or ad sales or anything like that,
[01:27:03.007 --> 01:27:08.591]  These can always be monitored and then sold on the private market by these CIA or NSA types.
[01:27:09.191 --> 01:27:14.135]  But see, something that was illegal back in the 70s is now in plain view.
[01:27:14.195 --> 01:27:22.721]  They're saying relationships with the Fortune 500 and the Matrix System, the state-level NSA vacuum cleaner suction cup,
[01:27:23.454 --> 01:27:31.059]  All of this is to be given in a two-way membrane between private industry, which owns and runs our intelligence agencies.
[01:27:31.359 --> 01:27:35.301]  So now that pipeline is being beefed up and being legitimized.
[01:27:35.682 --> 01:27:44.007]  You know, that was like last year, the Pentagon betting scheme, where they were going to bet on new terror attacks and make money off of it.
[01:27:44.027 --> 01:27:45.728]  Well, they did go ahead and privatize that.
[01:27:46.188 --> 01:27:50.531]  Something that's illegal, they just legalize and hide in plain view.
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:55.963]  I mean, so much of what was unbelievable just a few years ago is now hidden in plain view.
[01:27:56.343 --> 01:28:13.714]  Well, you know, to some degrees it's really easy to squash these people like bugs, because in a way, you know, when you were a little kid, you know, you were told Aesop's Fables, and Aesop's Fables, one of the earliest, one of these nursery rhymes was, don't put all your eggs in one basket.
[01:28:14.144 --> 01:28:20.545]  Now what is it that Bush and his buddies are keep pushing is telling us to consolidate, consolidate, consolidate.
[01:28:20.585 --> 01:28:21.886]  That monopolies are good.
[01:28:22.246 --> 01:28:24.886]  They're telling us to put all our eggs in one basket.
[01:28:24.986 --> 01:28:30.107]  And every two-year-old and every moron can tell you that's the stupidest idea yet.
[01:28:30.247 --> 01:28:31.167]  So, there we go.
[01:28:32.288 --> 01:28:33.548]  I heartily agree with you.
[01:28:33.608 --> 01:28:35.608]  Thank you so much, sir, for your phone call.
[01:28:35.628 --> 01:28:36.488]  Alright, have a good America.
[01:28:37.408 --> 01:28:39.749]  Alright, we'll be back with Tim and others.

[01:30:55.723 --> 01:30:58.685]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.

[01:32:00.141 --> 01:32:03.162]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[01:32:03.742 --> 01:32:06.363]  A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[01:32:06.383 --> 01:32:09.724]  I'm the guy who's the boss on this highway.
[01:32:09.924 --> 01:32:12.765]  So watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way.
[01:32:13.065 --> 01:32:15.186]  If you break the law, you'll hear from me.
[01:32:15.406 --> 01:32:17.627]  I know I'm working for the state.
[01:32:17.807 --> 01:32:18.987]  I'm the Highway Patrol.
[01:32:19.067 --> 01:32:24.289]  Well, you'll know me when you see me, cause my door's been locked.
[01:32:24.469 --> 01:32:26.129]  Alright my friends, we're back live.
[01:32:26.209 --> 01:32:27.230]  Alex Jones here, your host.
[01:32:29.778 --> 01:32:39.700]  If you're joining us for the first time and you're wondering where this broadcast is coming from, if I sound frantic or upset, it's because I am.
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:52.682]  I mean, I love this country and all the basic bedrock foundations and the pillars, the canons, the heart of what this nation is supposed to be is being dismantled.
[01:32:54.003 --> 01:32:55.103]  And I can't stand it.
[01:32:55.163 --> 01:32:56.203]  I love this country.
[01:32:57.489 --> 01:33:04.032]  And a government doubling its growth rate, the Bill of Rights being butchered, the borders being wide open.
[01:33:06.794 --> 01:33:09.615]  Denver, Colorado, a public school put up the U.S.
[01:33:09.655 --> 01:33:20.181]  flag and the Mexican flag and people complained last week and they took it down, but then said that once the danger is over,
[01:33:21.025 --> 01:33:23.147]  By the hate mongers, they're going to put it back up.
[01:33:23.587 --> 01:33:27.310]  And that, well, the school is 85% from Mexico, and they want it.
[01:33:27.811 --> 01:33:28.752]  Well, what are you going to do?
[01:33:28.872 --> 01:33:29.792]  School, win?
[01:33:30.573 --> 01:33:36.058]  Maybe just let them put it back up, and then what's going to happen when they say, we don't want an American flag, period, in there?
[01:33:37.479 --> 01:33:39.260]  I mean, I've been to Mexico quite a few times.
[01:33:39.761 --> 01:33:42.243]  I don't see the American flag hanging in their schools.
[01:33:43.644 --> 01:33:48.008]  And again, the majority of Hispanics in major polls are against these open borders and against all this.
[01:33:48.068 --> 01:33:55.034]  But, you know, people say, what's going to happen when, when they say take the American flag down?
[01:33:55.094 --> 01:33:58.757]  Well, four or five years ago, they did a ten-part series.
[01:33:58.777 --> 01:34:01.220]  It was more than four or five years ago.
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:02.140]  That was back in 99.
[01:34:02.381 --> 01:34:10.448]  Yeah, five years ago, they did a ten-part series on the San Antonio Express News, where
[01:34:11.582 --> 01:34:16.804]  At the time it was, what, four different Texas towns, but the one town in focus was El Cenizo.
[01:34:18.245 --> 01:34:20.646]  And they do not fly the American flag there.
[01:34:20.686 --> 01:34:22.187]  They fly the Mexican flag.
[01:34:23.687 --> 01:34:27.449]  You're not allowed to speak English in court proceedings, which is discriminatory.
[01:34:27.629 --> 01:34:28.530]  Only Spanish.
[01:34:31.111 --> 01:34:32.231]  It's already happening.
[01:34:32.751 --> 01:34:34.752]  And why am I going off into this tirade?
[01:34:36.673 --> 01:34:38.414]  Well, that's articles I've got in front of me.
[01:34:38.434 --> 01:34:39.434]  It gives me a headache.
[01:34:39.915 --> 01:34:40.915]  It makes me angry.
[01:34:42.725 --> 01:34:43.445]  It hurts me.
[01:34:45.787 --> 01:35:11.344]  I mean, last night I was listening to a Los Angeles radio show that gets carried locally on the station I'm on, the Terry Anderson broadcast, and he was playing members of the Los Angeles City Council up there saying, White America's dying, we're taking over, your time is over, it's the time of Chicanos and Hispanics and
[01:35:12.003 --> 01:35:13.924]  And if you don't like it, leave the country!
[01:35:13.984 --> 01:35:14.885]  Ha ha ha!
[01:35:14.965 --> 01:35:15.925]  You old whiteys!
[01:35:16.465 --> 01:35:17.526]  I mean, it was racist!
[01:35:18.586 --> 01:35:21.888]  And I'm somebody who was raised not to dislike anybody.
[01:35:21.948 --> 01:35:24.770]  A lot of my friends are Hispanic, frankly.
[01:35:26.430 --> 01:35:27.931]  Most of my really good friends are.
[01:35:27.951 --> 01:35:28.692]  It just so happens.
[01:35:29.232 --> 01:35:30.352]  That's who I get along with.
[01:35:31.153 --> 01:35:32.814]  But they're not like this.
[01:35:32.854 --> 01:35:33.974]  They don't talk like this.
[01:35:34.234 --> 01:35:35.315]  They're against all this.
[01:35:36.543 --> 01:35:46.069]  uh... but the people in power are out there pushing it and by the way when you look at who funds the radicals that want to break this country up
[01:35:46.930 --> 01:35:48.431]  It's the big banks in New York.
[01:35:48.491 --> 01:35:54.816]  It's the old white men with, you know, the German last names or the Irish last names or the Jewish last names.
[01:35:55.196 --> 01:35:58.759]  You know, the old line power structure.
[01:35:59.219 --> 01:36:07.205]  They're using Mexico and Latin America to break down the sovereignty of this country because they want to have a Balkanization take place.
[01:36:07.545 --> 01:36:12.129]  They want to have kind of a French separatist movement like they have in Canada in the Southwest.
[01:36:15.211 --> 01:36:19.114]  Because let me tell you, the average Mexican loves America and has nothing against America.
[01:36:19.594 --> 01:36:24.198]  But by the time our government and our public schools and colleges are done with them, they do hate America!
[01:36:25.779 --> 01:36:26.880]  And that scares me!
[01:36:27.901 --> 01:36:29.902]  That's just one of the issues I'm concerned about.
[01:36:30.503 --> 01:36:37.528]  And George Bush wants blanket, total, in perpetuity, amnesty.
[01:36:40.749 --> 01:36:56.139]  A six-year program that automatically renews every six years, and in it, I've read the bill, in it, it says that Fortune 500 can pay to bring unskilled workers here, and that if you want to come, you're legal.
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:00.462]  I mean, folks, there's 6,350,000,000 people at a census from four years ago.
[01:37:00.622 --> 01:37:01.603]  It's even more now.
[01:37:06.932 --> 01:37:10.595]  Though we don't know the specific numbers, but it's over six billion, three hundred million.
[01:37:11.696 --> 01:37:15.940]  And they all want to come here, and they'll work for nothing, folks!
[01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:19.102]  And yeah, they will work harder than a lot of Americans.
[01:37:19.643 --> 01:37:20.243]  It's true!
[01:37:22.005 --> 01:37:31.373]  But for a lot of us who do want to work, and who will work two, three jobs, it's hurting us because we can't compete, and we're not going to be able to even buy those slave goods from China anymore.
[01:37:33.445 --> 01:37:41.607]  So if you look at an economic system of taking care of the people and having a free market and having a good society, it doesn't make sense.
[01:37:41.667 --> 01:37:45.467]  The model the globalists are pushing and building doesn't make sense.
[01:37:47.348 --> 01:37:52.909]  From the position of doing good, having a middle class grow, getting people out of poverty.
[01:37:53.949 --> 01:38:02.211]  No, the model they're pushing creates a tiny, ultra-elite, with almost no middle class, with a giant underclass.
[01:38:04.764 --> 01:38:08.407]  Who have no chance of crawling up out of this system.
[01:38:09.327 --> 01:38:10.889]  Then they tell us there's no inflation.
[01:38:10.909 --> 01:38:12.890]  There was another article this weekend in the paper.
[01:38:13.390 --> 01:38:13.911]  Local paper.
[01:38:13.951 --> 01:38:14.932]  I spent hours reading it.
[01:38:16.533 --> 01:38:19.955]  And it was, there was an article about how you gotta be vaccinated.
[01:38:19.995 --> 01:38:20.616]  It's the law.
[01:38:20.836 --> 01:38:21.496]  Not true.
[01:38:21.516 --> 01:38:29.902]  Another article about, oh, the state guard is going to be on the streets and searching your bags and running your life and doing arrests and there's going to be new law enforcement.
[01:38:30.003 --> 01:38:30.423]  It's good.
[01:38:31.437 --> 01:38:35.578]  There was another article in there about, oh, the dollar needs to go down even more.
[01:38:35.678 --> 01:38:37.499]  Oh, this is so good for the dollar.
[01:38:38.059 --> 01:38:39.399]  So we don't have inflation.
[01:38:39.439 --> 01:38:42.700]  And, ooh, your stocks are worth more because the dollar's worth less.
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:45.220]  Folks, that's all a paper manipulation.
[01:38:47.981 --> 01:38:51.022]  If the dollar goes down in value, yeah, that'll boost stock prices.
[01:38:51.522 --> 01:38:55.843]  But it's only because they're readjusting because the dollar's worth more.
[01:38:56.503 --> 01:38:57.984]  It's only a paper equation.
[01:38:58.024 --> 01:38:58.884]  It means nothing.
[01:39:00.094 --> 01:39:04.736]  And it went into how good it is to have a bad dollar, and boy, let's get a weaker dollar going here.
[01:39:04.756 --> 01:39:07.737]  I don't know, I could tirade all day.
[01:39:07.797 --> 01:39:13.679]  It's just... There's so many issues, and so many bad things happen in this country.
[01:39:14.039 --> 01:39:15.459]  And I'm not trying to be negative!
[01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:20.201]  Man, I would love, love... I'm a good salesman.
[01:39:20.461 --> 01:39:21.281]  I'm good at business.
[01:39:21.781 --> 01:39:26.483]  I would love to go open a big coffee shop bookstore,
[01:39:27.913 --> 01:39:47.225]  And just go do that and have fun and just make a decent living and not worry about this stuff and go play golf every afternoon and hang out with my children and go on cruises and go on trips to Europe and what I don't, I just sit here and fight the New World Order literally 18 hours a day.
[01:39:47.365 --> 01:39:49.046]  I fought them 18 hours yesterday.
[01:39:49.586 --> 01:39:50.707]  I'm exhausted right now.
[01:39:52.539 --> 01:39:57.766]  Because I love this country and because it's not negative to sit here and give you all this bad information.
[01:39:58.326 --> 01:39:59.588]  All this scary information.
[01:39:59.968 --> 01:40:04.274]  Because overall it's a positive thing to warn people about the threat.
[01:40:08.339 --> 01:40:09.200]  Just heaven help us.
[01:40:10.754 --> 01:40:24.709]  They're openly talking about putting chips in us, openly pushing concentration camps, openly pushing arresting those that disagree with the government, openly bills are almost passing at the state level that put you in prison for life if you download music illegally.
[01:40:25.409 --> 01:40:28.292]  I mean, it's just, they're building giant prisons everywhere.
[01:40:28.733 --> 01:40:33.278]  The police are looking meaner and meaner, strutting around in black uniforms and combat boots.
[01:40:33.838 --> 01:40:36.562]  They're issuing them sound weapons and microwave guns.
[01:40:36.882 --> 01:40:39.986]  DARPA says they're going to put up mind control towers publicly.
[01:40:40.947 --> 01:40:42.489]  Folks, I'm freaking out here!
[01:40:45.352 --> 01:40:52.801]  I've read hundreds of top scientific reports about how sodium fluoride brain damages you and is a toxic sedative.
[01:40:54.284 --> 01:40:58.808]  I know they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines and mercury at hundreds of times the safe level.
[01:40:58.848 --> 01:41:01.510]  I know they're sterilizing women with the stuff in the tetanus shots.
[01:41:02.211 --> 01:41:10.118]  I know that they've tested biologicals and chemicals on the population right through the mid-1980s, the last stuff that was declassified.
[01:41:10.458 --> 01:41:21.748]  We got a government that'll lock a GI in a room and nerve gas him just to see what it does to him, killing people and no one gets in trouble, and they admit they do it routinely, and then it's just what they do, the exercise of power,
[01:41:22.528 --> 01:41:33.958]  I see free speech being shut down everywhere, preachers being arrested for reading the Bible on street corners, anti-war protesters locked in cages inside cages under train stations.
[01:41:37.141 --> 01:41:37.261]  Ugh!
[01:41:39.583 --> 01:41:39.683]  Ugh!
[01:41:40.316 --> 01:41:42.017]  And then the government says, well, it's for terror.
[01:41:42.377 --> 01:41:47.601]  But every time I look at their programs, even if you bought their terror argument, it says to fight terror and crime.
[01:41:47.961 --> 01:42:07.595]  The Neighborhood Watch is going to spy on you, and look through your windows to fight terror and crime, and we're going to drug all the children, and we're going to test all of you psychologically, and we're going to make the school year go 11 months out of the year, and we're going to keep your kids until 8 o'clock at night, and we're going to have a national draft for men and women, and we're going to... Whoo, man!
[01:42:09.238 --> 01:42:10.038]  All right, that's enough.
[01:42:12.699 --> 01:42:14.300]  Jim in Rhode Island, thanks for holding.
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:17.942]  I appreciate you putting up with that last tirade diatribe.
[01:42:18.582 --> 01:42:19.962]  I couldn't agree more, Alex.
[01:42:20.002 --> 01:42:21.423]  You're right on the money, as usual.
[01:42:23.564 --> 01:42:24.684]  What's on your mind, my friend?
[01:42:25.124 --> 01:42:38.890]  Alex, I wanted to, in spite of the fact that you have a national, well, actually, I guess, worldwide show, you have a huge following here in Rhode Island, and I wanted to put out a call for volunteers to collect signatures for constitutional
[01:42:39.437 --> 01:42:40.477]  Party candidates.
[01:42:40.557 --> 01:42:46.699]  We're trying to get all the nomination papers signed and get all the required signatures from... Mr. Peruca?
[01:42:46.999 --> 01:42:48.019]  Yes, yes.
[01:42:48.279 --> 01:42:50.960]  And again, plug our affiliate there in Providence.
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:55.161]  W-A-R-L 1320 in Providence, a place I worked for a short time.
[01:42:55.201 --> 01:42:55.821]  Great station.
[01:42:56.421 --> 01:43:01.982]  Yeah, and by the way, for those who just joined us, what was it, six months ago?
[01:43:02.582 --> 01:43:04.783]  Your governor tried to declare martial law
[01:43:06.285 --> 01:43:10.748]  What he tried to do, Alex, I guess you could certainly call it a form of martial law.
[01:43:11.889 --> 01:43:17.113]  If you flew a flag other than an American flag, you would be subject to arrest.
[01:43:17.674 --> 01:43:20.956]  If you said anything against the government, you would be subject to arrest.
[01:43:21.797 --> 01:43:26.341]  I've only read bits and pieces of it, but it certainly is draconian, no doubt about it.
[01:43:26.361 --> 01:43:27.161]  Now let me stop you.
[01:43:28.222 --> 01:43:30.184]  Your governor's not really known as a conservative.
[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:33.522]  Our governor is known as a neo-con.
[01:43:33.542 --> 01:43:34.803]  He's a republican.
[01:43:34.903 --> 01:43:35.504]  Exactly.
[01:43:35.524 --> 01:43:37.125]  Not known as a real conservative.
[01:43:37.145 --> 01:43:48.095]  But the point I was going to make is, at the same time Oregon was trying to pass Senate Bill 742 to amend Chapter 666, introduced by Senator Menace.
[01:43:48.255 --> 01:43:49.736]  Folks, this is not the Phil Henry Show.
[01:43:50.016 --> 01:43:50.657]  I'm serious.
[01:43:51.117 --> 01:43:52.138]  It is 666.
[01:43:52.198 --> 01:43:53.099]  His name is Menace.
[01:43:53.735 --> 01:44:04.999]  It almost passed 100 plus reasons for life in prison in a forest labor camp, and one of them was downloading music or blocking traffic, uh, old protesters.
[01:44:05.019 --> 01:44:12.722]  The point is, then your governor comes out, and I read the bill on air, and it was in the Providence Journal, and it was also in your local, what is it, News 9,
[01:44:14.787 --> 01:44:16.829]  Channel 6, Channel 6, Channel 12, and Channel 10.
[01:44:16.970 --> 01:44:18.571]  Isn't there one called Channel 9?
[01:44:19.072 --> 01:44:20.113]  I'm going from memory here.
[01:44:20.133 --> 01:44:21.254]  I have the articles posted.
[01:44:21.915 --> 01:44:22.796]  You're absolutely right.
[01:44:22.816 --> 01:44:23.657]  You're absolutely right.
[01:44:23.877 --> 01:44:24.338]  And it was.
[01:44:24.378 --> 01:44:25.399]  It was very draconian.
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:29.624]  And it made it to, I think, the statehouse floor for the representatives.
[01:44:30.003 --> 01:44:32.304]  And they squashed it, and deservingly so.
[01:44:32.364 --> 01:44:33.444]  It should have been squashed.
[01:44:33.524 --> 01:44:36.905]  But the point is, is that he puts a window dressing on.
[01:44:36.945 --> 01:44:40.987]  If you fly anything with the American flag at your house or business, you'll be put in prison.
[01:44:41.507 --> 01:44:44.808]  But then he went on to add, if you disagree with the government, it actually said it.
[01:44:45.188 --> 01:44:51.010]  And then we, you know, the transmitters down the street from the Capitol, we put the call out that day.
[01:44:51.070 --> 01:44:52.571]  The next day he apologized.
[01:44:52.911 --> 01:44:55.094]  But the point is, they're trying this stuff.
[01:44:55.354 --> 01:45:01.441]  And if we didn't have that radio station there, I guarantee you, Rhode Island would have this right now.
[01:45:02.068 --> 01:45:06.369]  Yeah, not only that, not only did he apologize, but he pled ignorance.
[01:45:06.629 --> 01:45:08.170]  Yeah, he voted for this guy.
[01:45:08.230 --> 01:45:18.852]  He said, exactly, he said in the next Providence article, these are all posted on Infowars.com, Providence Journal article, he said, it's my staff's fault, they got this from Homeland Security.
[01:45:19.232 --> 01:45:21.373]  Well, that's even worse if he's not reading it.
[01:45:21.633 --> 01:45:22.633]  Yeah, I don't buy it.
[01:45:22.673 --> 01:45:24.794]  You know, it's just like the Patriot Act, Alex.
[01:45:25.074 --> 01:45:29.755]  These guys all are saying, all these congressmen and senators are all saying that they didn't know what was in it.
[01:45:30.015 --> 01:45:36.657]  The Patriot Act has been getting kicked around since the Oklahoma City bombing when Clinton tried to push it through.
[01:45:36.677 --> 01:45:37.318]  That's right.
[01:45:37.498 --> 01:45:39.619]  It's just a different variance of it.
[01:45:40.039 --> 01:45:41.539]  Most of these guys were in office.
[01:45:41.799 --> 01:45:43.560]  They've seen it two or three times before.
[01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:45.000]  I don't buy it.
[01:45:45.421 --> 01:45:47.721]  Oh, Congressman Ron Paul and others admit that.
[01:45:48.002 --> 01:45:51.903]  Now, real quick, plug the Constitution Party, how folks help in Rhode Island.
[01:45:52.003 --> 01:45:55.744]  I am trying to organize folks to go out and collect signatures for Mike Perutka.
[01:45:56.104 --> 01:45:57.385]  My name is Timothy Goodness.
[01:45:57.839 --> 01:46:05.201]  And you can contact me at timgoodness at hotmail.com and I'll even give my home phone number, Alex, if you don't mind.
[01:46:05.521 --> 01:46:05.881]  Tim?
[01:46:05.901 --> 01:46:07.662]  Give me your website again.
[01:46:08.142 --> 01:46:14.243]  It's my email address, timgoodness, all one word, all lowercase, at hotmail.com.
[01:46:14.583 --> 01:46:15.784]  My goodness, that's goodness!
[01:46:15.944 --> 01:46:18.324]  Yep, and my home phone number is 295-4122.
[01:46:18.665 --> 01:46:22.065]  I'm looking for people to go out and collect signatures.
[01:46:22.085 --> 01:46:24.066]  You've got to give folks the area code.
[01:46:24.619 --> 01:46:26.120]  401.
[01:46:24.639 --> 01:46:26.120]  We're in Rhode Island.
[01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:27.260]  Give me the number again.
[01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:31.221]  People didn't hear that.
[01:46:31.241 --> 01:46:31.501]  401-295-4122.
[01:46:31.541 --> 01:46:32.602]  My name is Tim Goodness.
[01:46:33.022 --> 01:46:35.663]  Looking for people to go out and collect signatures for Mike Berutka.
[01:46:35.903 --> 01:46:36.183]  All right.
[01:46:36.243 --> 01:46:36.603]  Thank you.
[01:46:36.923 --> 01:46:37.503]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:46:37.864 --> 01:46:38.284]  You bet.
[01:46:38.364 --> 01:46:41.485]  And I really do appreciate that affiliate and every other affiliate.
[01:46:42.465 --> 01:46:46.286]  They are so precious to getting the word out and fighting the New World Order.
[01:46:46.406 --> 01:46:47.587]  Just praise God for that.
[01:46:48.447 --> 01:46:52.529]  Next up here is Annette in New York.
[01:46:52.589 --> 01:46:53.169]  You're on the air.
[01:46:53.209 --> 01:46:53.549]  Go ahead.
[01:46:54.164 --> 01:46:54.784]  Hi, Alex.
[01:46:55.124 --> 01:46:55.625]  Hello, Annette.
[01:46:55.785 --> 01:46:56.785]  Hi, how are you, sir?
[01:46:56.905 --> 01:46:57.425]  Good, my dear.
[01:46:57.665 --> 01:46:59.546]  Hi, my name is Annette.
[01:46:59.606 --> 01:47:01.027]  I'm from New York.
[01:47:01.087 --> 01:47:01.667]  I'm 41 years old.
[01:47:02.747 --> 01:47:05.108]  And I bumped into your website by accident.
[01:47:06.048 --> 01:47:08.069]  And I think what you're doing is a great thing.
[01:47:09.810 --> 01:47:13.131]  Years ago, I read about the New World Order when I was in my 20s.
[01:47:14.372 --> 01:47:18.233]  And, you know, when you're young, you think maybe all this stuff will go away.
[01:47:19.193 --> 01:47:20.614]  And it's just gotten worse.
[01:47:21.181 --> 01:47:24.003]  Yeah, that's putting it lightly.
[01:47:24.383 --> 01:47:26.705]  Yeah, I've read books on this stuff.
[01:47:26.725 --> 01:47:29.307]  In fact, I had recently bought a book.
[01:47:29.327 --> 01:47:30.408]  I don't know if you've ever heard of him.
[01:47:31.248 --> 01:47:31.989]  William Cooper.
[01:47:32.789 --> 01:47:33.810]  Yeah, she's dead.
[01:47:34.150 --> 01:47:35.111]  Yes, he got killed.
[01:47:35.311 --> 01:47:38.233]  And he put out a book, Behold a Pale Horse.
[01:47:39.274 --> 01:47:41.935]  And a lot of that stuff is about what you talk about.
[01:47:42.956 --> 01:47:46.879]  And that lady that you had from Box Voting.
[01:47:47.876 --> 01:47:51.158]  I had went to a cinema last night that shows documentaries.
[01:47:51.398 --> 01:47:52.398]  Yes, Ben Harris.
[01:47:52.658 --> 01:47:52.938]  Yes.
[01:47:53.679 --> 01:48:00.262]  And, um, they showed about the unprecedented, uh, 2000 election, about the voting machines.
[01:48:01.583 --> 01:48:06.505]  And, uh, when I saw her on, on that, um, I said, Oh my God.
[01:48:06.545 --> 01:48:09.346]  I said, you know, cause I saw your interview with her.
[01:48:10.407 --> 01:48:13.508]  And, um, it's a shame what's going on.
[01:48:13.608 --> 01:48:14.809]  It's, um, it's,
[01:48:15.914 --> 01:48:19.097]  It's painful to me because it's Democratic and Republican.
[01:48:19.777 --> 01:48:25.302]  And I find it very absurd that these are self-serving politicians.
[01:48:25.642 --> 01:48:28.905]  Well, that's another thing I didn't mention in my list of horrible things that are happening.
[01:48:29.386 --> 01:48:36.111]  Of the big five voting machine companies, three of them are run by former directors or deputy directors of the CIA.
[01:48:36.191 --> 01:48:36.411]  Right.
[01:48:36.692 --> 01:48:39.094]  The other big one's run by the former head of the NSA.
[01:48:39.414 --> 01:48:44.876]  The other one's owned by Clear Channel and they admit that they got wireless transmitters in them.
[01:48:45.216 --> 01:48:45.916]  No record.
[01:48:46.137 --> 01:48:48.477]  They've been caught engaged in fraud coast to coast.
[01:48:48.497 --> 01:48:49.798]  Their own engineers have quit.
[01:48:50.198 --> 01:48:53.599]  I mean, this isn't like, oh, the machines are meshing up, they're screwing up.
[01:48:53.899 --> 01:48:55.040]  This is on purpose.
[01:48:55.100 --> 01:48:56.140]  We're losing our right to vote.
[01:48:56.240 --> 01:49:05.904]  And the elected officials, the companies that have these voting machines, the elected officials can get, you know,
[01:49:09.729 --> 01:49:12.171]  Uh, you know... Yeah, here's an example.
[01:49:12.311 --> 01:49:13.071]  Here's an example.
[01:49:13.572 --> 01:49:16.293]  Senator Hagel was 15... Senator Hagel, I know.
[01:49:16.453 --> 01:49:18.374]  I saw that last night on your website.
[01:49:18.595 --> 01:49:18.795]  Yep.
[01:49:18.995 --> 01:49:21.777]  Senator Hagel was 15 points behind in polls.
[01:49:22.397 --> 01:49:24.198]  Then he got elected with a landslide.
[01:49:24.538 --> 01:49:28.841]  Then we learned that he magically owned the machines that 80% of people... He owned the machines.
[01:49:29.241 --> 01:49:30.382]  Yeah.
[01:49:30.422 --> 01:49:32.843]  So they own the machines that people vote for them on.
[01:49:33.223 --> 01:49:38.927]  Michael McCall's father-in-law owns the machines that he got swept into office on here in Austin.
[01:49:39.662 --> 01:49:47.606]  Well, I want to know, what can I do to help, uh, you know, uh, help get this... I bought your videos.
[01:49:47.846 --> 01:49:48.706]  I'll tell you after the break.
[01:49:48.726 --> 01:49:49.207]  Thanks for the call.
[01:49:49.247 --> 01:49:49.647]  We'll be back.
[01:49:52.617 --> 01:49:54.178]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:54.318 --> 01:49:57.419]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:57.559 --> 01:50:01.441]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:01.501 --> 01:50:05.742]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:06.083 --> 01:50:09.844]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:09.984 --> 01:50:11.785]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:12.005 --> 01:50:15.289]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[01:50:15.329 --> 01:50:20.054]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:20.214 --> 01:50:23.257]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:23.437 --> 01:50:26.301]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:26.781 --> 01:50:32.908]  The neighbors in that area, Sandpoint Naval Air Station, were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:33.428 --> 01:50:37.209]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[01:50:37.629 --> 01:50:38.990]  Order your video today.

[01:50:51.713 --> 01:50:54.734]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:50:55.054 --> 01:50:59.975]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:00.235 --> 01:51:04.576]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:04.876 --> 01:51:13.778]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:13.978 --> 01:51:17.599]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[01:51:17.919 --> 01:51:22.941]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:23.241 --> 01:51:29.964]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:30.445 --> 01:51:30.985]  What about you?
[01:51:31.758 --> 01:51:36.641]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35.

[01:52:59.544 --> 01:52:59.944]  Alright.
[01:52:59.984 --> 01:53:03.567]  Tom and Elizabeth and John, everybody else, your calls are coming up.
[01:53:03.607 --> 01:53:06.509]  You know, it's a good sign, though, in this nation that
[01:53:24.620 --> 01:53:28.382]  Some of the biggest websites on the internet are exposing the New World Order.
[01:53:28.943 --> 01:53:35.347]  The majority of news on the internet is anti-establishment, exposing the globalists.
[01:53:35.447 --> 01:53:42.471]  This broadcast is on in upstate New York and Maryland and Rhode Island and Boston.
[01:53:43.531 --> 01:53:55.100]  And Florida, and Texas, and Kansas, and Missouri, and Colorado, and Utah, and California, and just all over the place.
[01:53:55.420 --> 01:53:56.141]  New Mexico.
[01:53:56.661 --> 01:53:58.082]  We're getting more and more affiliates.
[01:53:58.222 --> 01:53:58.802]  Ohio.
[01:53:58.883 --> 01:54:00.264]  Two great affiliates in Ohio.
[01:54:01.044 --> 01:54:02.285]  Just God bless you all.
[01:54:02.545 --> 01:54:03.846]  Thank you for what you're doing.
[01:54:05.487 --> 01:54:11.472]  Because look, what's happened is, as this show gets more and more hardcore, we actually get more affiliates.
[01:54:12.443 --> 01:54:20.885]  Because five, six years ago, talk station owners, managers would hear me on the radio or hear me on the satellite or hear me as a guest and laugh at me.
[01:54:21.445 --> 01:54:23.565]  But they weren't bad people, they just couldn't believe it.
[01:54:23.665 --> 01:54:25.886]  Hey, I can't believe this stuff and I'm here seeing it!
[01:54:26.946 --> 01:54:27.646]  Okay?
[01:54:27.826 --> 01:54:28.727]  I wish it wasn't true.
[01:54:29.227 --> 01:54:35.488]  But they've been man enough and woman enough, not to mention Tennessee and a bunch of other states too, but I'm curious.
[01:54:36.488 --> 01:54:42.151]  But they were man or woman enough that once they saw the facts, they said, man, get that man on our local radio station.
[01:54:42.591 --> 01:54:43.051]  It's true.
[01:54:43.131 --> 01:54:44.472]  I'm standing up for this country.
[01:54:44.872 --> 01:54:47.013]  And a lot of sponsors have stepped up to the plate.
[01:54:47.653 --> 01:54:50.014]  And all we're doing is defending America.
[01:54:50.234 --> 01:54:52.035]  We're not the ones dismantling this country.
[01:54:52.235 --> 01:54:53.816]  And I'm sorry if it's painful to hear.
[01:54:54.216 --> 01:54:55.096]  I don't want to believe it.
[01:54:55.136 --> 01:54:55.937]  But it's true.
[01:54:56.117 --> 01:54:57.157]  I love this country.
[01:54:57.497 --> 01:54:59.298]  We're losing America right now.
[01:54:59.998 --> 01:55:05.041]  You know, Annette had a nice call from New York and she said she got my videos.
[01:55:05.081 --> 01:55:05.801]  What should she do?
[01:55:07.097 --> 01:55:09.298]  Annette, feel free to make copies of my films.
[01:55:09.379 --> 01:55:14.442]  I mean, VHS tapes cost like $1.00, $20.00, $50.00 apiece in bulk, maybe $1.00 apiece.
[01:55:15.382 --> 01:55:21.086]  And get a new VCR for $50.00, hook them up, and every night when you go to bed, pop a video in, make a copy.
[01:55:21.106 --> 01:55:22.567]  When you get up in the morning, label it.
[01:55:23.047 --> 01:55:24.488]  Take you about two or three minutes every day.
[01:55:25.468 --> 01:55:29.391]  Label it and give it to a friend, a neighbor, a county commissioner, a local talk show host.
[01:55:31.078 --> 01:55:38.662]  You know, I've put out thousands of copies of videos and that's supported us over the years, but I do radio interviews almost every day, sometimes multiple times daily.
[01:55:38.682 --> 01:55:42.163]  I mean, you'll hear me on your local radio station at 2 a.m.
[01:55:42.223 --> 01:55:43.244]  or 6 a.m.
[01:55:43.264 --> 01:55:44.524]  You know, I'm all over the place.
[01:55:44.584 --> 01:55:45.845]  I'm the hardest working guy on radio.
[01:55:47.046 --> 01:55:51.248]  And you'll hear callers call in and they'll say, I saw your video.
[01:55:51.288 --> 01:55:51.948]  It woke me up.
[01:55:51.988 --> 01:55:53.429]  And I'll say, did you get it for me?
[01:55:53.449 --> 01:55:54.629]  And they'll go, no, I didn't.
[01:55:54.669 --> 01:55:56.610]  It's a copy of a copy of a copy.
[01:55:56.650 --> 01:55:57.310]  Is that alright?
[01:55:57.330 --> 01:55:58.351]  And I go, oh yes!
[01:55:58.931 --> 01:56:00.452]  Please make copies of that copy.
[01:56:01.289 --> 01:56:02.549]  I mean, I've done my own little poll.
[01:56:03.009 --> 01:56:06.870]  So for those of you that have gotten the films and have made copies of them, it's had a huge effect.
[01:56:07.250 --> 01:56:10.371]  For those that have aired them on AXS TV, God bless you, air them again.
[01:56:10.831 --> 01:56:12.551]  Get my new film, Matrix of Evil.
[01:56:12.911 --> 01:56:13.992]  Get The Masters of Terror.
[01:56:14.032 --> 01:56:15.752]  Get Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:56:16.092 --> 01:56:18.913]  Get George Humphrey's new video we carry on 9-11.
[01:56:19.613 --> 01:56:21.033]  Play them on AXS TV.
[01:56:21.353 --> 01:56:29.395]  You're authorized to make copies of my films in FoeWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and get the films.
[01:56:29.495 --> 01:56:30.375]  Watch clips of them.
[01:56:30.415 --> 01:56:30.955]  Read about them.
[01:56:32.153 --> 01:56:35.035]  Thousands of videos have turned into millions, folks.
[01:56:35.416 --> 01:56:39.379]  And for those of you that got copies of the films and haven't made copies, please make copies.
[01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:43.602]  My videos are $25.95 apiece.
[01:56:43.623 --> 01:56:45.524]  $20 if you order three or more of any of the ten titles.
[01:56:45.904 --> 01:56:47.526]  Many of them are two and a half hours long.
[01:56:47.546 --> 01:56:48.887]  They're all over two hours long.
[01:56:49.950 --> 01:56:51.851]  So big discount when you get three or more.
[01:56:51.871 --> 01:56:59.477]  Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order via the Safe Secure Shopping Cart or simply call toll free to order 1-888-253-3139
[01:57:06.181 --> 01:57:10.664]  You can call and ask questions, or order, or hear about the different specials we have to offer.
[01:57:10.684 --> 01:57:11.584]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:57:11.845 --> 01:57:16.707]  Give us a call, folks.
[01:57:16.828 --> 01:57:17.508]  Get the films.
[01:57:17.948 --> 01:57:18.669]  Make copies.
[01:57:19.049 --> 01:57:19.949]  Get them out to people.
[01:57:20.510 --> 01:57:27.614]  I carry a bunch of other books and videos and books on tape that are incredible by other researchers that you need to have, so definitely get those as well.
[01:57:27.634 --> 01:57:29.715]  888-253-3139 or prisonplanet.com or infowars.com.
[01:57:36.397 --> 01:57:41.204]  All right, the third hour with your calls, a ton of news, and Paul Watson is straight ahead.
[01:57:41.264 --> 01:57:44.309]  Stay with us.
[01:57:50.137 --> 01:57:50.818]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.439 --> 01:57:52.460]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.198 --> 01:57:54.279]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.939 --> 01:57:55.779]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.540 --> 01:57:57.420]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.101 --> 01:58:02.003]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.283 --> 01:58:06.425]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:10.087 --> 01:58:17.711]  Alright, he's a good friend of mine, and I have him on each and every week because, well, not only does Paul Watson work for me,
[01:58:19.191 --> 01:58:25.757]  Running PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv, I respect his intellect, his worldview.
[01:58:25.777 --> 01:58:41.691]  I don't want to say he's a carbon copy of myself, because he has his own style, his own angle, but looking at his website years ago, and by the way, Paul woke up at the New World Order watching me on national British television four years ago,
[01:58:43.072 --> 01:58:51.762]  Looking at his own website, I saw that he really cut to the chase, had the full spectrum analysis of what the New World Order is and gave people the big picture.
[01:58:52.062 --> 01:58:58.510]  So I hired him and he runs PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and of course I run with my wife InfoWars.com.
[01:59:00.872 --> 01:59:03.894]  But Paul, what is some of the news we're going to cover this hour?
[01:59:03.914 --> 01:59:13.398]  I know I've got a bunch I want to get to, and of course we'll get to these calls coming up here in the next segment that have been holding the longest, but what's some of the stuff you think is the most important that we should be made aware of?
[01:59:13.418 --> 01:59:24.543]  Well, I think in the run-up to the Republican National Convention, obviously the police state developments in light of that over the past few days are just gigantic.
[01:59:25.638 --> 01:59:35.864]  The story about the FBI calling on, you know, the 40, 50 top organizers of the protest groups is obviously something that we need to discuss at length.
[01:59:35.924 --> 01:59:45.229]  And then things like the 9-11 panel calling for the National ID Card, what the Republicans and Bush administration wanted all along.
[01:59:45.909 --> 01:59:50.312]  So, um, several police state developments that we need to cover in the show today.
[01:59:52.162 --> 01:59:55.563]  And of course, Bill Clinton and John Kerry won a national ID card too.
[01:59:56.843 --> 02:00:07.366]  Well yeah, and I mean even like Howard Dean, part of his platform was calling for a national ID card and Big Brother, same with John Edwards, so it's the same agenda across the board.
[02:00:07.946 --> 02:00:09.626]  Yeah, on the key issues there's no change.
[02:00:09.946 --> 02:00:17.188]  Plus Abu Ghraib, our doctors ordered in all these different camps to revive people who've been tortured into unconsciousness.
[02:00:17.708 --> 02:00:21.029]  Now that's what our doctors are doing, I mean that is like Joseph Mingala.
[02:00:22.156 --> 02:00:30.925]  Well it is, and not just ordered to do so, but, you know, willingly, according to the articles that we've posted, that they carried out this barbarity.
[02:00:32.026 --> 02:00:37.711]  As he said, reviving dead people to make it look as if, you know, they were okay to keep the casualty numbers down.
[02:00:38.212 --> 02:00:44.538]  And we had reports months ago coming out of Abu Ghraib, dozens weekly, dead bodies and the autopsies,
[02:00:45.377 --> 02:00:49.338]  The official autopsy reports were changed by those same doctors.
[02:00:49.398 --> 02:00:54.400]  So, as the article says that we've got posted today, it is a reincarnation of Mengele.
[02:00:55.220 --> 02:00:59.962]  Well, they would also do stuff like pack the bodies in ice and put an IV in them and then ship them out.
[02:01:01.770 --> 02:01:05.572]  And people, we had the BBC article, people still dying at Abu Ghraib.
[02:01:05.612 --> 02:01:14.215]  I mean, the situation was a fight broke out amongst some of the detainees, I think, and to stop the fight, two of them were shot dead.
[02:01:14.695 --> 02:01:22.138]  So, I mean, those same kind of tactics are still taking place, you know, four or five months after the torture scandal broke, at least publicly.
[02:01:24.159 --> 02:01:29.461]  It's amazing, and remember, the Army's own report, 70 to 90 percent of those taken
[02:01:30.245 --> 02:01:58.380]  to these thirty-two camps are families who quote didn't have their papers in order and now outside uh... uh... the iraqi city where they're attacking the uh... the shiite uh... religious leader Najaf they're now arresting reporters well last week they machine gunned the building and said get out of it we're going to kill you our government threatening to kill reporters i mean uh... when al-qaeda does it it's bad but when our government does it it's good western reporters well yeah and i mean
[02:01:59.111 --> 02:02:07.448]  The Iranian and some of the Iraqis have come out and said that these so-called kidnappings are mainly people who...
[02:02:08.268 --> 02:02:09.889]  You know, write in support.
[02:02:09.989 --> 02:02:16.755]  Well, not in support, but take a kind of balanced view on the side of the resistance versus the occupation.
[02:02:16.815 --> 02:02:20.217]  So it's not as if these people are pro-occupation.
[02:02:20.337 --> 02:02:22.779]  In many cases, they're against the occupation.
[02:02:22.819 --> 02:02:29.784]  So, I mean, why would these so-called resistance groups kidnap journalists who were writing fair and balanced articles?
[02:02:29.804 --> 02:02:34.368]  It makes no sense unless those journalists are being kidnapped by someone else altogether.
[02:02:34.568 --> 02:02:36.970]  And then our government's saying they're going to kill them out in the open.
[02:02:37.933 --> 02:02:39.114]  So, there's no debating it.
[02:02:39.134 --> 02:02:40.375]  We'll be right back with more news.
[02:02:40.415 --> 02:02:44.037]  Your call, stay with us.
[02:02:44.717 --> 02:02:49.080]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:53.682]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:53.822 --> 02:02:58.205]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:58.245 --> 02:02:59.606]  The New World Order.
[02:03:00.326 --> 02:03:01.306]  Panama!
[02:03:01.367 --> 02:03:05.608]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:05.648 --> 02:03:12.591]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:12.711 --> 02:03:14.792]  You will lose your liberty.

[02:04:45.623 --> 02:04:46.603]  Spring has arrived.
[02:04:46.803 --> 02:04:49.765]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:04:49.985 --> 02:04:53.427]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:04:53.647 --> 02:05:01.771]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[02:05:02.051 --> 02:05:05.793]  With Ark's Heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[02:05:05.973 --> 02:05:11.035]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[02:05:11.295 --> 02:05:15.798]  Ark's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[02:05:15.998 --> 02:05:20.060]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[02:05:20.140 --> 02:05:27.283]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce, and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[02:05:27.563 --> 02:05:28.103]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.346 --> 02:05:52.407]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.127 --> 02:05:54.228]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.869 --> 02:05:55.769]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.450 --> 02:05:57.331]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.031 --> 02:06:01.674]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.214 --> 02:06:06.377]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.419 --> 02:06:11.761]  We have a global elite that is not free market.
[02:06:12.382 --> 02:06:16.084]  It controls the dominant corporations that, in turn, control the government.
[02:06:16.865 --> 02:06:20.608]  They are seeking to set up a total police state with absolute despotism.
[02:06:21.374 --> 02:06:25.157]  And they call their system the New World Order, or Globalism.
[02:06:25.837 --> 02:06:29.841]  The free trade area of the Americas is racing towards us in the next four months.
[02:06:30.421 --> 02:06:31.982]  We will lose all our sovereignty.
[02:06:32.422 --> 02:06:34.004]  It has nothing to do with trade, folks.
[02:06:34.064 --> 02:06:35.145]  It's about global government.
[02:06:37.086 --> 02:06:47.294]  In fact, we're talking to a man who lives in a country, one of the last holdouts that hasn't gone under full EU control, where the EU arrests people that criticize it, where there's no free market rights,
[02:06:48.244 --> 02:07:00.551]  Where the families are being broken up and regulated, where euthanasia is being accelerated, and this is all owned by the same people that now own and run America, and whether it's George Bush or John Kerry, the same people run this system.
[02:07:00.811 --> 02:07:06.134]  Paul, let's talk about the EU system for a few minutes, and then I want to go to some of these calls and back into some of the news you talked about.
[02:07:06.154 --> 02:07:17.701]  The current drive of the EU is not just to get Britain under the single European currency, but it's to pass this European referendum.
[02:07:18.323 --> 02:07:28.333]  And most people who give informed opinions on the European Constitution and this referendum that will pass it if it's voted for in Britain, you know, haven't even read the thing.
[02:07:28.393 --> 02:07:35.641]  And I've read it, and it's a basic, complete takeover of military, social, governmental, educational policy in Britain.
[02:07:36.241 --> 02:07:50.858]  And people have come out and said, Tony Blair himself has said, that if the British population vote no to the European Constitution with this referendum, then they'll just keep on having more referendums each year until they vote yes.
[02:07:51.562 --> 02:08:02.077]  And I mean the kind of things, it will concentrate power into the hands of a few unelected people sitting in Brussels to then direct complete control over British government policy.
[02:08:02.378 --> 02:08:06.003]  Well here's a local, you know, micro-level.
[02:08:07.132 --> 02:08:12.477]  Here in Austin, they've already built some of the train station depots for light rail.
[02:08:12.537 --> 02:08:13.778]  We've struck it down twice.
[02:08:13.818 --> 02:08:16.600]  They're bringing it back now, have their new special voting machines in.
[02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:19.542]  And they say they don't care what we want, they're going to put it in.
[02:08:20.163 --> 02:08:25.487]  Our local government, now to a regional planning unelected board, just gave over all authority of our roads.
[02:08:25.807 --> 02:08:33.594]  They're now going to put in, not nine, but fifteen toll roads on every major road, existing roads, no traveling without getting on them.
[02:08:34.074 --> 02:08:35.136]  I mean, it's just total.
[02:08:35.216 --> 02:08:45.192]  This is globalism, and under the Pan-American Union, which is the enacting clause of the Free Trade Area of the Americas, they're going to set up a government, and they admit this.
[02:08:46.070 --> 02:08:52.955]  In Atlanta or Miami, and it's going to be over our Congress, and it's going to have members from all of the Americas in it!
[02:08:53.595 --> 02:08:54.976]  And this is official, Paul!
[02:08:55.276 --> 02:09:02.781]  I watch C-SPAN and watch our government, you know, two and a half years ago meet in Canada for the meeting and say all this.
[02:09:03.061 --> 02:09:07.024]  You read the legislation, it clearly says it, but the average person has no idea!
[02:09:08.388 --> 02:09:25.590]  Well no, and I mean a similar thing over in Britain where, I mean we've got an entire archive on it, the EU archive, you know, with articles like Britain's criminal law will be run by Brussels, British criminal law will be taken over gradually by Brussels under clauses in the draft European Constitution.
[02:09:26.170 --> 02:09:34.577]  So it's not just about global government, it's about policy down to that level that you mentioned, which is tracking the vehicle you drive across the country.
[02:09:35.097 --> 02:09:51.110]  And they will gradually unfold that across the entirety of the country of America, like they did in Britain, by immediately firstly having it beta tested in London, then introduce it into major cities throughout the country, and eventually it blankets the entirety of the country itself.
[02:09:51.210 --> 02:09:53.992]  And so the same thing you will see unfold in America.
[02:09:55.089 --> 02:09:56.070]  Well, it's like Austin.
[02:09:56.290 --> 02:10:02.476]  There's going to be no toll booths, you're going to have to have a transponder, and you go check in with the city each year and pay your fee.
[02:10:02.496 --> 02:10:15.668]  And they're getting people prepared for that, you know, by things like the Trucking Association, whereby it's mandatory for those trucks to have that kind of GPS locator on there to track it from place to place.
[02:10:15.688 --> 02:10:19.912]  So there's several different elements in which they're trying to competition people to accept that.
[02:10:20.032 --> 02:10:21.353]  Oregon says they're going to do it.
[02:10:22.941 --> 02:10:26.283]  Yeah, there's an article every day talking about that.
[02:10:26.303 --> 02:10:37.010]  I mean, we don't even get a chance to post them all normally or talk about them all, but in every major city there's an article at least, you know, introducing a beta program to test those kind of systems every day.
[02:10:38.110 --> 02:10:45.117]  And five years ago, I had someone from the Federal Board on, who was against it, laying out this plan, and oh look, it's happening!
[02:10:45.157 --> 02:10:47.499]  I mean, people, do you want to live under this?
[02:10:48.179 --> 02:10:49.140]  Well, obviously not.
[02:10:49.180 --> 02:10:59.610]  They say that 99% of people in Austin are against the toll roads, but our mayor says, I don't care what you want, I just gave up all our authority and perpetuity to this private corporate board!
[02:11:01.111 --> 02:11:01.552]  Well now, and
[02:11:02.688 --> 02:11:12.636]  You won't get a chance to decide on it, even though 99% of the people are against it, because the people overseeing the policy will not have been elected into those positions by the people in the first place.
[02:11:12.677 --> 02:11:13.757]  By the way, I'm not kidding.
[02:11:14.358 --> 02:11:19.262]  I mean, 600 people show up against it, and 10 show up for it at meetings.
[02:11:20.042 --> 02:11:25.987]  The newspaper does polls, and it's 92% against it, but I've met no one on the street that's for the toll roads.
[02:11:26.007 --> 02:11:29.890]  The most liberal, the most conservative, I have met no one, Paul!
[02:11:31.191 --> 02:11:31.712]  No one!
[02:11:32.918 --> 02:11:35.280]  Well, it's interesting how they promote these polls.
[02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:39.503]  I mean, you'll get one which is, you know, 99% against that kind of idea.
[02:11:39.563 --> 02:11:40.664]  It will get little attention.
[02:11:40.684 --> 02:11:51.592]  But then, I mean, there was a poll on the weekend which said that 50% people in America still believe that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, and around 20% still believe they were involved in 9-11.
[02:11:51.833 --> 02:11:57.237]  So that poll's going to get a lot of attention, but something like the Toll Road poll isn't.
[02:11:57.975 --> 02:12:03.078]  Well, I'll tell you how the psychology for those just joining us for the Weapons of Mass Destruction.
[02:12:03.578 --> 02:12:03.979]  What is it?
[02:12:04.419 --> 02:12:08.982]  30, 40 times, Paul, where they go, this is a biological weapons lab.
[02:12:09.122 --> 02:12:10.542]  Reporters go to it, it's a bakery.
[02:12:10.963 --> 02:12:12.424]  These are mobile weapons trucks.
[02:12:12.464 --> 02:12:14.585]  Turns out they're for pumping up balloons.
[02:12:15.866 --> 02:12:16.826]  These are mass graves.
[02:12:16.866 --> 02:12:19.308]  Turns out it's an exchange program from the Iran-Iraq War.
[02:12:19.988 --> 02:12:22.790]  Probably 15 times they found sarin nerve gas shells.
[02:12:22.830 --> 02:12:23.790]  Turns out they never were.
[02:12:23.950 --> 02:12:26.452]  But, the retraction
[02:12:27.509 --> 02:12:29.611]  Is in the back of the paper if it's even there.
[02:12:30.131 --> 02:12:32.113]  And so people just remember the headlines.
[02:12:32.453 --> 02:12:33.594]  And I still have arguments.
[02:12:33.614 --> 02:12:35.836]  People going, oh no, we found the weapons of mass destruction.
[02:12:36.356 --> 02:12:39.218]  I remember two weeks ago it was they found nuclear bombs.
[02:12:40.399 --> 02:12:42.121]  And then, oh, we were wrong about that.
[02:12:42.161 --> 02:12:43.602]  I mean, it just never ends.
[02:12:44.890 --> 02:12:52.736]  Well yeah, they will show people photographs of UN inspectors opening these shells and sniffing them.
[02:12:53.616 --> 02:12:58.840]  If they were chemical weapons, you're not going to have people sticking their noses in them, but people still see this.
[02:12:58.900 --> 02:13:05.445]  And as you mentioned, the retraction, as not just in the case of weapons of mass destruction, in anything basically,
[02:13:06.125 --> 02:13:07.666]  Is in the back of the newspaper.
[02:13:07.946 --> 02:13:11.787]  So it's shunted out from public view and the original perception remains.
[02:13:11.807 --> 02:13:14.908]  I mean, that's what, you know, creating those paradigms is all about.
[02:13:14.968 --> 02:13:16.129]  So they do it again and again.
[02:13:16.449 --> 02:13:24.051]  Well, here's an example of fake boards and kangaroo courts and cities and counties just becoming rubber stamps.
[02:13:24.091 --> 02:13:26.012]  They give the real authority to these unelected boards.
[02:13:26.052 --> 02:13:28.153]  We've got this access TV board here in Austin.
[02:13:30.161 --> 02:13:34.964]  We found out that Ron Frank, the board president, has consulted for Time Warner.
[02:13:35.004 --> 02:13:36.245]  That's on his own website.
[02:13:38.066 --> 02:13:42.028]  RonFrank.com in the client comments section.
[02:13:42.048 --> 02:13:43.289]  Well, that's a conflict of interest.
[02:13:43.669 --> 02:13:51.093]  We've got two other board members in business together with this Teach One Media thing where they quote, want the new channel to be educational only.
[02:13:51.453 --> 02:13:53.054]  And then it turns out they want their show on it.
[02:13:53.094 --> 02:13:54.135]  That's a conflict of interest.
[02:13:54.535 --> 02:14:08.747]  So, because we've been complaining and going and trying to stop them, they go, okay, we're going to have an eight-member Access TV producer board under us that reports to us with no voting power, and we're going to appoint three of the members, and you're going to have five of the members.
[02:14:08.767 --> 02:14:11.709]  Well, of the five that get elected, they'll make sure some of theirs get elected.
[02:14:12.069 --> 02:14:16.833]  And so you'll make recommendations to us, and then the rest of the producers won't even matter, basically.
[02:14:16.853 --> 02:14:19.075]  It's another one of these rubber-stamp operations.
[02:14:19.295 --> 02:14:21.677]  And by the way, that's six o'clock tomorrow night.
[02:14:22.197 --> 02:14:23.418]  I just turned off the radio.
[02:14:23.458 --> 02:14:24.339]  Yeah, I want to tell
[02:14:52.694 --> 02:14:55.255]  Alex Jones, something about Arnold Schwarzenegger?
[02:14:55.615 --> 02:14:55.895]  Yes, sir.
[02:14:55.936 --> 02:14:56.796]  You're on the air with him.
[02:14:57.136 --> 02:14:57.356]  Yeah.
[02:14:58.156 --> 02:14:59.437]  Uh, okay.
[02:14:59.457 --> 02:15:02.538]  There's a book that came out around 1990.
[02:15:02.578 --> 02:15:08.800]  It was called Arnold and Unauthorized Biography.
[02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:11.381]  And the author was Wendy Leigh.
[02:15:12.061 --> 02:15:13.182]  L-E-I-G-H.
[02:15:13.262 --> 02:15:14.342]  Are you aware of that?
[02:15:14.742 --> 02:15:15.163]  Uh, yes.
[02:15:16.303 --> 02:15:17.403]  Oh, okay.
[02:15:17.423 --> 02:15:18.984]  There's a lot of stuff there about
[02:15:19.981 --> 02:15:24.763]  How Arnold's parents, you know, basically worshipped Adolf Hitler.
[02:15:26.124 --> 02:15:32.027]  Well, his father was a SS police chief, a head SS officer, but they could say, well, that's just his daddy.
[02:15:32.107 --> 02:15:33.067]  Okay, let's ignore that.
[02:15:33.528 --> 02:15:37.369]  He campaigned for an admitted Nazi and said, quote, I don't care if he's a Nazi.
[02:15:37.409 --> 02:15:38.370]  I love Kurt Voltheim.
[02:15:38.630 --> 02:15:41.511]  He said, I've always wanted to be a dictator like Hitler.
[02:15:41.791 --> 02:15:42.712]  That's another quote.
[02:15:43.792 --> 02:15:45.552]  You know, the guy does all of this.
[02:15:45.592 --> 02:15:50.313]  The guy gets up at a bodybuilding contest in 1978 and screams how much he hates black people.
[02:15:51.594 --> 02:15:53.194]  But, oh, he's okay.
[02:15:53.254 --> 02:15:54.354]  Paul Watson comments.
[02:15:54.394 --> 02:15:56.615]  Yeah, do you have a reference for that about 1978?
[02:16:00.615 --> 02:16:05.296]  Which, yes, that was Associated Press and the Drudge Report.
[02:16:05.876 --> 02:16:06.736]  Drudge Report.
[02:16:07.257 --> 02:16:07.837]  Ah, let's see.
[02:16:07.857 --> 02:16:09.277]  How do I find that?
[02:16:09.858 --> 02:16:19.604]  Well, it was last year, or earlier this year during the election, so you can just go to the website and just type it into a search engine and it should pop up for you.
[02:16:20.504 --> 02:16:22.325]  Okay, let's see.
[02:16:24.167 --> 02:16:36.614]  And I want to, this is a more serious point, I want to ask the guest, what do you think the agenda is in Darfur, in Sudan?
[02:16:37.566 --> 02:16:38.746]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[02:16:38.846 --> 02:16:40.747]  Paul, what do you think of his question?
[02:16:41.867 --> 02:16:51.831]  Well, I haven't looked into the Sudan situation in any detail, but I know for months they've been building up naval contingents around several different African countries.
[02:16:52.451 --> 02:17:03.934]  And obviously we know there's a lot of oil in there, there's a lot of diamond supplies in there, and so they're picking off the countries one by one, which they promised they would do in the PNAC documents.
[02:17:04.094 --> 02:17:05.855]  Going back to the Schwarzenegger point,
[02:17:07.163 --> 02:17:12.686]  Um, Arnold himself doesn't have to, you know, have intimate knowledge about the agenda that he's being used for.
[02:17:13.146 --> 02:17:21.951]  They mainly just pick people whose mentality they think will reflect and advance in that more subtle way the agenda that, you know, is planned for all of us.
[02:17:21.991 --> 02:17:30.476]  Which is why he was picked by Lord Rothschild, um, during the time where he was debating whether even to run for the governorship of California.
[02:17:31.136 --> 02:17:43.202]  Um, just like Edwards was picked as the running mate by Bilderberg, so they find the right mentality that matches the agenda which they wish to push, and then they pick the placement to carry it out, and that's what happened with Arnold.
[02:17:43.402 --> 02:17:43.902]  That's right.
[02:17:43.922 --> 02:17:45.903]  Yeah, you didn't fade the music out.
[02:17:59.417 --> 02:18:06.479]  ...water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:18:06.659 --> 02:18:08.019]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:18:08.219 --> 02:18:14.421]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path of the self-sterilizing filters.
[02:18:14.681 --> 02:18:20.642]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts,
[02:18:20.922 --> 02:18:21.803]  That's right.
[02:18:45.649 --> 02:18:46.749]  Bath soap and dish soap.
[02:18:46.990 --> 02:18:50.831]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:18:51.151 --> 02:18:51.971]  Read the labels.
[02:18:52.392 --> 02:18:56.513]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache and nausea.
[02:18:56.753 --> 02:19:00.935]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucus membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:19:01.315 --> 02:19:06.177]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:19:06.577 --> 02:19:10.179]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:19:10.339 --> 02:19:15.683]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:19:15.943 --> 02:19:18.684]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:19:18.985 --> 02:19:19.885]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:19:43.755 --> 02:19:44.735]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:19:44.815 --> 02:19:49.597]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:19:49.757 --> 02:19:57.559]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:19:57.819 --> 02:20:03.201]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:20:03.401 --> 02:20:10.383]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:20:10.683 --> 02:20:16.007]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:20:16.267 --> 02:20:21.010]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[02:20:21.350 --> 02:20:28.975]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:20:29.296 --> 02:20:34.759]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:20:35.840 --> 02:20:37.481]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:38.782 --> 02:20:40.564]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:41.304 --> 02:20:47.910]  Imagine a weight loss program that burns off calories by simply eating certain everyday foods.
[02:20:48.390 --> 02:20:50.732]  With the Reverse Calorie Diet, it's possible!
[02:20:51.292 --> 02:20:57.057]  Every time you eat food, various organs such as your liver, spleen and stomach have to work to complete digestion.
[02:20:57.477 --> 02:21:03.762]  For example, an ordinary piece of cake that has 300 calories may require only 25 calories to complete digestion.
[02:21:04.142 --> 02:21:12.089]  But a reverse calorie food that contains 50 calories may require 100 calories to complete digestion, actually removing fat from your body.
[02:21:12.509 --> 02:21:16.311]  Diets based on reverse calorie foods have resulted in amazing weight losses.
[02:21:16.711 --> 02:21:22.955]  One lady written up in the Journal of Medicine actually lost a whopping 256 pounds in just over one year.
[02:21:23.475 --> 02:21:29.218]  Our easy-to-follow guide reveals more than 100 secret foods that naturally burn fat from your body.
[02:21:29.598 --> 02:21:32.200]  To order the reverse calorie diet risk-free for just $19.95, call 1-800-647-3200.
[02:21:32.280 --> 02:21:32.820]  It's guaranteed!
[02:21:33.100 --> 02:21:33.340]  Call 1-800-647-3200.
[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:33.560]  That's 1-800-647-3200.
[02:21:52.406 --> 02:21:54.987]  Alright, we're back live, folks.
[02:21:55.108 --> 02:21:56.288]  Going back to your calls.
[02:21:56.348 --> 02:21:58.189]  Let's talk to Elizabeth in Maryland.
[02:21:58.289 --> 02:21:59.250]  Elizabeth, you're on the air.
[02:21:59.290 --> 02:21:59.710]  Go ahead.
[02:22:01.711 --> 02:22:02.872]  Good to talk to you, Elizabeth.
[02:22:04.651 --> 02:22:05.171]  She's gone.
[02:22:05.231 --> 02:22:07.092]  Let's go to John in Virginia.
[02:22:07.152 --> 02:22:08.073]  John, you're on the air.
[02:22:08.153 --> 02:22:08.593]  Go ahead.
[02:22:08.753 --> 02:22:09.053]  Hey, Alex.
[02:22:09.073 --> 02:22:09.693]  How are you doing?
[02:22:09.713 --> 02:22:10.514]  Good show today.
[02:22:10.614 --> 02:22:11.074]  Thank you, sir.
[02:22:11.514 --> 02:22:13.675]  Alex, I got a call from a friend of mine last night.
[02:22:13.735 --> 02:22:17.417]  His brother-in-law is a colonel at the National Guard here in Virginia.
[02:22:17.577 --> 02:22:17.837]  Yes.
[02:22:18.177 --> 02:22:24.160]  Was in charge of setting up all of the draft boards in every county in the state.
[02:22:24.634 --> 02:22:30.819]  Yeah, they set those up last year and this year, and Congress funded it, but when you talk about it, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:22:30.839 --> 02:22:39.185]  Well, apparently there's not a county in the entire country that does not have an active draft board ready to start the draft.
[02:22:39.685 --> 02:22:42.347]  Now what was interesting about the phone call last night was this.
[02:22:43.568 --> 02:22:48.492]  His brother-in-law was called to Camp Lejeune and has left this morning.
[02:22:49.164 --> 02:22:59.290]  He'll be in charge of all the emergency coordination between the federal agencies, FEMA, and the state and local law enforcement agencies.
[02:22:59.310 --> 02:23:12.118]  They are planning six weeks worth of training, and then starting October 1st, they're going to be shuttled off to a location that apparently his wife doesn't even know about.
[02:23:12.833 --> 02:23:20.105]  From October the 1st until January 1, all of the emergency first responders are going to be in place.
[02:23:20.768 --> 02:23:22.950]  Ready to go, should anything happen.
[02:23:23.530 --> 02:23:25.551]  And his wife can't know that.
[02:23:25.632 --> 02:23:26.352]  Apparently not!
[02:23:26.372 --> 02:23:33.197]  Because there's Al Qaeda everywhere, and then our first responders can't respond because Al Qaeda might know.
[02:23:33.357 --> 02:23:41.703]  Well, it's just interesting that the first responders, and I mean truly the first responders, are being activated with all the terroristic threats that we've had apparently.
[02:23:41.783 --> 02:23:43.584]  Camp Lejeune is Marine Corps.
[02:23:44.285 --> 02:23:44.965]  It's Marines.
[02:23:45.005 --> 02:23:46.467]  This guy's National Guard.
[02:23:47.267 --> 02:23:48.948]  Okay, now let me expand on this.
[02:23:48.968 --> 02:23:49.549]  Did you hear
[02:23:50.316 --> 02:23:53.940]  The police officer slash military officer I had on last Friday?
[02:23:53.960 --> 02:23:55.101]  Yes, sir, I did not.
[02:23:55.701 --> 02:23:59.165]  Well, I talked about this last Thursday on TV.
[02:23:59.205 --> 02:24:02.989]  We had him on the phone on the TV show, and that's in this weekly report that we just posted.
[02:24:03.349 --> 02:24:05.451]  Paul, is that report from last Thursday posted yet?
[02:24:07.113 --> 02:24:08.794]  The one from August 17th.
[02:24:10.056 --> 02:24:11.537]  No, it'll be last Thursday.
[02:24:11.577 --> 02:24:12.698]  That'd be the 19th.
[02:24:14.381 --> 02:24:15.261]  Well, not yet, no.
[02:24:15.301 --> 02:24:17.962]  In that case, it will be posted either today or tomorrow.
[02:24:18.462 --> 02:24:18.763]  Okay.
[02:24:19.163 --> 02:24:21.023]  Well, in that report we have him there.
[02:24:21.103 --> 02:24:23.084]  Also, it was in Friday's radio show.
[02:24:25.345 --> 02:24:33.768]  He brought the manual in, and it said the State Guard is now for gun confiscation, arrest, roundups, takeovers of cities.
[02:24:34.965 --> 02:24:40.506]  We've got these defense forces being set up, and they've been told they've got to be ready to go by November 1st.
[02:24:40.606 --> 02:24:44.147]  So, they've told us they're getting rid of Posse Commentatus, they've talked about all this.
[02:24:44.427 --> 02:24:49.428]  This may just be a drill, but the point is they're quietly gearing up all over the country.
[02:24:49.708 --> 02:24:50.688]  Comments, John?
[02:24:51.629 --> 02:24:59.570]  Definitely gearing up, and it's interesting to me that with all of the phony warnings that we have, these folks have not been put in place.
[02:24:59.670 --> 02:25:02.511]  They are being put in place as of October.
[02:25:03.909 --> 02:25:05.370]  You never know what to expect.
[02:25:06.090 --> 02:25:19.954]  I know this, we talked about it Thursday and Friday, and then on Saturday, front page of the Statesman, headline, new role for Texas State Guard, and it says they'll be on the streets, they'll be searching you, they'll be involved running your life.
[02:25:20.494 --> 02:25:21.675]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[02:25:22.195 --> 02:25:31.598]  Well, apparently what's going to happen is they think it's going to happen sometime between October and January, so that may just
[02:25:32.039 --> 02:25:37.743]  It would be coincidence, but I think with the elections, I look at it this way, neither side's going to be happy.
[02:25:37.823 --> 02:25:40.965]  I mean, if Kerry wins, then the Republicans are going to be upset.
[02:25:41.005 --> 02:25:43.847]  If Bush wins, the Democrats are going to be upset.
[02:25:43.887 --> 02:25:47.129]  And I think that between that and this new draft they got coming,
[02:25:48.345 --> 02:25:50.146]  There's going to be.
[02:25:50.246 --> 02:25:53.066]  We're headed for some biblical times, I do believe.
[02:25:53.086 --> 02:25:54.047]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:25:54.327 --> 02:25:58.808]  And by the way, the draft boards have been disbanded since 1975.
[02:25:59.248 --> 02:26:00.048]  This is new.
[02:26:00.148 --> 02:26:02.389]  They have shut the draft boards back up.
[02:26:02.709 --> 02:26:08.831]  In every county in the country, and this colonel confirmed it didn't matter who was going to be elected.
[02:26:09.386 --> 02:26:12.668]  The draft was going to take place shortly after the election.
[02:26:12.808 --> 02:26:19.251]  In the last week, I've talked to four people in uniform that have told me they have been told, officially, it is a done deal.
[02:26:19.492 --> 02:26:20.172]  It's a done deal.
[02:26:20.192 --> 02:26:21.273]  That's what I've heard, too.
[02:26:22.753 --> 02:26:23.714]  Godspeed, my friend.
[02:26:23.754 --> 02:26:24.634]  Keep up the good work.
[02:26:25.155 --> 02:26:25.635]  Thank you.
[02:26:26.015 --> 02:26:29.657]  Now, they know it's wildly unpopular.
[02:26:30.037 --> 02:26:30.978]  No one is for it.
[02:26:31.998 --> 02:26:34.080]  They introduce the bills and say, oh, it's a conspiracy.
[02:26:34.100 --> 02:26:34.800]  We're not for it.
[02:26:35.620 --> 02:26:44.487]  Paul, they're going to have to carry out a terror attack, and then say, oh my gosh, we're under attack, we've got to do it, Patriot Act 2, draft, secret arrest, more prisons, Paul?
[02:26:45.345 --> 02:26:47.726]  Well, they may not even need to carry out a terror attack.
[02:26:48.106 --> 02:27:03.531]  They may just announce it, and that in itself will cause massive civil unrest, which will then create the pretext to say, you know, the country's falling apart, it's in chaos, we need the Homeland Draft to sheeple the people around the country, those who are misbehaving.
[02:27:03.771 --> 02:27:08.133]  But it's interesting that there's this whole debate about, you know, if they're going to introduce the draft.
[02:27:08.613 --> 02:27:15.037]  They already have, with these people having, you know, mandatory extensions of their tours of duty, the backdoor draft.
[02:27:15.138 --> 02:27:16.679]  So they're already doing it now.
[02:27:17.439 --> 02:27:28.226]  And with the promise of multi-theatre wars, as PNAC said, and them arming all the enemies which will, you know, cause the outcry for the draft.
[02:27:28.286 --> 02:27:32.229]  I mean, we had an article, Iranian missiles aided by US technology.
[02:27:32.249 --> 02:27:33.310]  We got a break, stay there!
[02:27:34.931 --> 02:27:37.853]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.835 --> 02:27:41.618]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.661 --> 02:27:50.346]  We all have busy lives and sometimes that causes us to miss out on the things that are most important to us.
[02:27:50.846 --> 02:27:53.989]  Well, when it comes to Genesis programs, you'll never have to miss out again.
[02:27:54.648 --> 02:28:00.569]  For only $19.95 plus $3 shipping and handling, you can receive an entire month of recorded GCN programs.
[02:28:01.069 --> 02:28:04.690]  That's right, an entire month for only $19.95 plus shipping and handling.
[02:28:05.130 --> 02:28:07.791]  The recordings are in MP3 format and compact disc.
[02:28:08.231 --> 02:28:12.032]  They're playable on computers along with most newer CD and DVD players.
[02:28:12.492 --> 02:28:16.433]  All you need to know is the name of the program you would like a copy of and the month that it aired.
[02:28:16.983 --> 02:28:20.284]  Don't be left out of current news and information that affects our lives every day.
[02:28:20.624 --> 02:28:26.166]  We all want to stay informed, so visit our website at GCNLive.com and click on the GCN Mall.
[02:28:26.667 --> 02:28:30.548]  Or call 877-996-4327, extension 150.
[02:28:31.508 --> 02:28:32.549]  It's easy and convenient.
[02:28:32.609 --> 02:28:34.129]  Hurry and get your copies today.
[02:28:34.610 --> 02:28:39.251]  Again, visit the GCN Mall at GCNLive.com or simply call 877-996-4327, extension 150.
[02:28:46.033 --> 02:28:49.037]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:28:49.378 --> 02:28:58.209]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:28:58.530 --> 02:29:03.216]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:29:03.656 --> 02:29:10.378]  The Murky Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:29:10.778 --> 02:29:22.582]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:29:23.042 --> 02:29:27.505]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:29:27.665 --> 02:29:30.127]  Get the Murky Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:30.147 --> 02:29:31.988]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:29:32.008 --> 02:29:33.188]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:33.269 --> 02:29:34.729]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:29:34.749 --> 02:29:35.810]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:29:45.966 --> 02:29:49.709]  In today's world of discord and disappointment, one thing's for sure.
[02:29:49.969 --> 02:29:54.753]  Car cover owners are so satisfied they'd buy their car covers all over again.
[02:29:54.773 --> 02:29:56.535]  Think car covers are a hassle?
[02:29:56.795 --> 02:29:57.015]  No.
[02:29:57.335 --> 02:30:01.118]  Research shows owners find covers easy to put on and take off.
[02:30:01.518 --> 02:30:02.859]  Are all covers the same?
[02:30:03.120 --> 02:30:03.340]  No.
[02:30:03.620 --> 02:30:07.243]  The standard in car cover fabric is Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[02:30:07.683 --> 02:30:09.824]  Don't let sun and dust damage your car.
[02:30:10.104 --> 02:30:12.604]  Kimberly Clark's Block-It Fabrics got you covered.
[02:30:12.884 --> 02:30:14.705]  That's Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[02:30:14.805 --> 02:30:16.845]  Cool weather brings cool cars.
[02:30:17.285 --> 02:30:18.186]  I don't think so.
[02:30:18.506 --> 02:30:22.147]  A cooling system can run too hot or too cold if not prepared for winter.
[02:30:22.507 --> 02:30:23.527]  Here's your to-do.
[02:30:23.767 --> 02:30:26.528]  Ask your local shop to perform the BG Coolant Flush.
[02:30:26.728 --> 02:30:32.349]  A simple test strip tells if your coolant's protecting the engine from temperature extremes or breaking down and corroding.
[02:30:32.709 --> 02:30:36.890]  The BG Chemistry cleans the system, then adds new coolant with conditioners.
[02:30:37.110 --> 02:30:39.350]  Ask your shop for a BG Coolant Flush.
[02:30:39.710 --> 02:30:41.951]  Or, go to BGFindAShop.com.
[02:30:42.171 --> 02:30:44.231]  That's BGFindAShop.com.
[02:30:55.153 --> 02:30:59.214]  The Globalists would never get a draft without their helpful little TeraVacs.
[02:31:01.334 --> 02:31:09.264]  They would never get the police state without it, and you look at who's behind the terror attacks, and lo and behold, the people that have the motive are involved!
[02:31:10.345 --> 02:31:15.091]  We're about to go back to Paul Watson, then Elizabeth, Kara, Brooke, and others.
[02:31:15.131 --> 02:31:15.972]  Before I do that,
[02:31:17.049 --> 02:31:19.470]  I did want to tell you about a great sponsor.
[02:31:19.931 --> 02:31:25.934]  Ready Reserve Foods has gained the reputation of providing virtually the finest dehydrated storable foods available.
[02:31:26.314 --> 02:31:31.057]  Perhaps that's why they are the oldest continually operated dehydrated food company in America.
[02:31:31.557 --> 02:31:36.800]  Food units need no refrigeration because they are nitrogen packed, which vastly extends their shelf life.
[02:31:37.361 --> 02:31:42.164]  The food units are compact and can be customized to fit your individual needs.
[02:31:42.485 --> 02:31:54.092]  Get a deluxe three-month food supply for one adult, normally $4.98, that's a lot of food, for half price by calling 800-453-2202 or visit them on their website at ReadyReserveFoods.com again that's 800-453-2202
[02:32:02.711 --> 02:32:10.177]  If you've been procrastinating because you don't know where to begin, call Ready Reserve Foods and ask for their free emergency preparedness checklist.
[02:32:10.557 --> 02:32:17.843]  Or call now and get a deluxe 3-month food supply of nitrogen-packed, storable food for half price for only $249 by calling 800-453-2202.
[02:32:17.883 --> 02:32:20.145]  Now my friends, I got a year food supply, okay?
[02:32:28.807 --> 02:32:37.150]  And when I ordered it, and two weeks later, a truck showed up, polite gentleman, loaded it into my garage, and it sits right there, ready.
[02:32:38.110 --> 02:32:40.511]  I'd already gotten some storable foods, and they were okay.
[02:32:40.591 --> 02:32:47.133]  Folks, they make all their own food, it's canned, it's all contained, it's all high quality, dehydrated.
[02:32:48.933 --> 02:32:50.154]  It's an insurance policy.
[02:32:50.274 --> 02:32:56.035]  I don't know what's going to happen, but I know this, if the economy goes belly up, I can feed my family for six months or so.
[02:32:56.055 --> 02:32:58.336]  I've got a year's supply, but it's only for two people.
[02:32:59.762 --> 02:33:03.825]  I've got, you know, firearms and water filters and a little bit of gold.
[02:33:04.345 --> 02:33:06.307]  These are the things that you really, really need.
[02:33:07.913 --> 02:33:10.835]  And so, folks, please give Ready Reserve Foods a call.
[02:33:10.955 --> 02:33:12.997]  I'm totally impressed.
[02:33:13.017 --> 02:33:13.417]  800-453-2202.
[02:33:13.437 --> 02:33:18.580]  And I hear Paul Watson waiting there in the wings.
[02:33:19.421 --> 02:33:21.863]  Paul, let's plug PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:22.163 --> 02:33:26.906]  Haven't done that yet today, and it's such an important thing that we do in our information war.
[02:33:27.226 --> 02:33:30.629]  Tell the listeners about some of the new features and what's on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:31.769 --> 02:33:37.033]  Well, obviously already we've got all of Alex's videos that have already been produced.
[02:33:37.822 --> 02:33:49.044]  And future videos, and I believe that, you know, you've got one or two which are in the pipeline, will be posted on the website weeks before they're available in hard copy.
[02:33:49.084 --> 02:33:54.765]  So, you know, people will either get the chance to watch them or just preview them before buying the actual thing.
[02:33:55.505 --> 02:34:03.187]  We've got every major audio interview from the Alex Jones Show that you can listen to and download onto your MP3 player.
[02:34:04.563 --> 02:34:06.365]  We've got extensive archives.
[02:34:06.385 --> 02:34:15.170]  We've got George Humphrey's video on there, Eric Huffschmidt's 9-11 video on there, and many more to come.
[02:34:15.210 --> 02:34:19.893]  We've got several videos going on there this week from other people.
[02:34:20.273 --> 02:34:32.061]  Well, within the next three to four days, we're going to have a new 90-minute video I did with a friend called American Dictators about Bush and Kerry, and that'll go on sale at the end of this week on the website.
[02:34:33.240 --> 02:34:34.561]  Again, it'll take a week or so to get it.
[02:34:35.161 --> 02:34:39.283]  So, for weeks, it's going to be on the site first, for members.
[02:34:39.724 --> 02:34:42.265]  We've got my book, your book, for download there.
[02:34:42.285 --> 02:34:43.146]  We can read it online.
[02:34:43.806 --> 02:34:45.407]  We've got all my videos.
[02:34:45.507 --> 02:34:47.488]  We've got a bunch of other documentaries on there.
[02:34:47.508 --> 02:34:50.290]  15 cents a day if you sign up for a year.
[02:34:50.310 --> 02:34:52.591]  19 cents a day if you sign up for a month.
[02:34:53.011 --> 02:34:56.213]  PrisonPlanet.tv, folks.
[02:34:56.353 --> 02:35:00.916]  And it makes the rest of the websites possible because we did this because it was a Catch-22.
[02:35:02.313 --> 02:35:10.477]  We can't have millions of people watching the videos, and then I can't pay the four, five, six, seven thousand dollar bills each month, victims of our own success.
[02:35:10.817 --> 02:35:16.921]  By doing this, we can still have about half the stuff for free, and frankly, when you sign up, you are subsidizing people to get the word out.
[02:35:17.201 --> 02:35:22.183]  But then also, you get all that exclusive, privileged membership access to everything.
[02:35:22.524 --> 02:35:24.104]  PrisonPlanet.tv, Paul.
[02:35:25.665 --> 02:35:31.989]  Well, yeah, people need to understand that, you know, the bandwidth costs don't just come from people visiting our website solely.
[02:35:32.169 --> 02:35:37.291]  We get linked from other massive websites for videos and audios that we post for free.
[02:35:37.351 --> 02:35:42.054]  So that's where, you know, most of the thousands and thousands of dollars of cost comes from.
[02:35:42.074 --> 02:35:44.015]  So it is subsidizing that side of things.
[02:35:45.021 --> 02:35:45.622]  Absolutely!
[02:35:45.662 --> 02:36:00.131]  PrisonPlanet.tv and if you want a copy of any of my films on VHS, DVD, any of the other films I carry, toll free number to call and get them is 1-888-253-3139 that's 888-253-3139 or via the safe secure shopping carts at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:36:00.651 --> 02:36:01.732]  Joining us is Pastor Butch Paul
[02:36:12.446 --> 02:36:15.469]  Has his own talk show here on the network from 8 to 9 o'clock each evening.
[02:36:16.009 --> 02:36:17.870]  And, uh, Butch, good to hear from you, my friend.
[02:36:17.910 --> 02:36:19.752]  Well, good program again, Alex, as usual.
[02:36:19.812 --> 02:36:23.175]  I mean, I try this every day, and I always learn something from your broadcast.
[02:36:23.235 --> 02:36:24.256]  Thank you for your hard work.
[02:36:24.276 --> 02:36:26.137]  Well, I learn something from you every night, too, my friend.
[02:36:26.177 --> 02:36:27.238]  Well, that's what we're here for.
[02:36:27.278 --> 02:36:28.759]  I want to share two things with you very quickly.
[02:36:28.779 --> 02:36:35.264]  To confirm your, uh, state guard story about, uh, doing November 1st, I have the same phone call from a state guardman here in West Virginia.
[02:36:35.304 --> 02:36:36.545]  Well, it's now in the newspaper here.
[02:36:36.585 --> 02:36:37.086]  Yes, it is.
[02:36:37.486 --> 02:36:39.648]  I got last Monday from a state, uh, guardman here.
[02:36:39.688 --> 02:36:40.969]  General alert as of November 1st.
[02:36:41.508 --> 02:36:49.775]  And also, another way of training people for brain and mind control, a local grocery store in Clarksburg, West Virginia, is called Food Line.
[02:36:49.995 --> 02:36:50.976]  L-I-O-N.
[02:36:50.996 --> 02:36:54.318]  There's a sign there that says, No ID, No Food.
[02:36:54.919 --> 02:37:02.245]  Now, of course, that means to cash a check or this type of thing, but it's the mind process of seeing the sign, No ID, No Food.
[02:37:02.325 --> 02:37:03.306]  No ID, No Food.
[02:37:03.366 --> 02:37:06.268]  They've got signs in HEB for a year in Austin.
[02:37:06.328 --> 02:37:09.891]  Now, it's gone in College Station, areas of Houston, one other town in Texas.
[02:37:10.623 --> 02:37:16.814]  But for a year, big red and yellow signs that say, no thumbprint, no transactions.
[02:37:17.375 --> 02:37:18.256]  Absolutely.
[02:37:18.476 --> 02:37:19.959]  And they admit it's going to go in.
[02:37:20.680 --> 02:37:21.802]  Folks, this is it.
[02:37:21.882 --> 02:37:22.764]  They're doing it!
[02:37:23.857 --> 02:37:25.739]  Well, I don't know, Alex, what more they can do.
[02:37:25.759 --> 02:37:32.526]  They're putting it right in front of us, and telling us what they're going to do in advance, and people still kind of step back with a glaze over their face.
[02:37:32.546 --> 02:37:39.193]  Pastor Butch, do you have $200 to buy a decent digital camera, maybe $100 for one, to take a digital photo of that?
[02:37:39.553 --> 02:37:40.414]  I got it.
[02:37:40.494 --> 02:37:41.816]  It's in the process of being done right now.
[02:37:42.396 --> 02:37:49.305]  Yeah, email it to tipsandinfowars.com, or you know my secret email address, and we will get that posted.
[02:37:49.365 --> 02:37:52.189]  Also, I'm sure it will be posted on calltodecision.com.
[02:37:52.209 --> 02:37:53.130]  Yes, it will be.
[02:37:53.350 --> 02:37:53.711]  It will be.
[02:37:53.731 --> 02:37:55.153]  It's in the process of being done right now.
[02:37:55.726 --> 02:37:58.668]  Now, again, you served in secret operations in Cambodia.
[02:37:58.768 --> 02:37:59.829]  I know you can't talk about it.
[02:38:00.129 --> 02:38:02.491]  You're a Vietnam veteran, Butch.
[02:38:03.392 --> 02:38:04.692]  I mean, you serve this country.
[02:38:04.732 --> 02:38:11.777]  You see the New World Order for what it is, and now they're getting ready for this draft, and they're getting all these units ready.
[02:38:11.837 --> 02:38:12.958]  I mean, this is just horrible.
[02:38:12.998 --> 02:38:13.839]  This is slavery.
[02:38:14.079 --> 02:38:19.323]  Well, 40 years ago, not quite that long, 30 some years ago when I was in the military, I went in 67.
[02:38:19.363 --> 02:38:20.984]  That's been quite a while back.
[02:38:21.571 --> 02:38:29.832]  Uh, the difference between now and then is phenomenal, but I saw it not too long after I got out in 71, 75, I started seeing things happening, not a question.
[02:38:30.152 --> 02:38:35.073]  I didn't get my eyes open until the early 90s, and when I finally saw there's more to this than that was meet the eye.
[02:38:35.393 --> 02:38:42.135]  And in the last 10 to 12 years, they have more than quadrupled their efforts in the last 10, 12 years.
[02:38:42.395 --> 02:38:48.696]  They're moving so quickly now, I don't know whether they're panicking because things are running out of time, or things get by with them.
[02:38:48.716 --> 02:38:50.576]  But Alex, it's right now, right here.
[02:38:51.877 --> 02:39:00.103]  And I don't know, if people can't see this mind control plot, when you see a sign that says, no ID, no food, that is, that's beyond me.
[02:39:01.744 --> 02:39:04.586]  Well, I turn the news on and it's take microchips.
[02:39:04.666 --> 02:39:06.988]  Children, it's good, take chips.
[02:39:07.429 --> 02:39:09.170]  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.
[02:39:09.750 --> 02:39:13.333]  Well, they are now in the process of, you know, microchipping prisoners.
[02:39:14.042 --> 02:39:18.604]  In Ohio, they have a plan now to do that and embrace this, but soon they won't put it in under the skin.
[02:39:18.944 --> 02:39:19.965]  California, too?
[02:39:20.025 --> 02:39:20.705]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:39:20.745 --> 02:39:21.685]  It's everywhere.
[02:39:22.066 --> 02:39:25.087]  And by the way, when you get a chance sometime, when you have a few minutes, give me a call off the air.
[02:39:25.927 --> 02:39:26.347]  Yes, sir.
[02:39:26.387 --> 02:39:27.168]  Good to hear from you.
[02:39:27.208 --> 02:39:27.808]  God bless you.
[02:39:27.848 --> 02:39:28.528]  Keep up the good work.
[02:39:29.609 --> 02:39:29.989]  Pastor?
[02:39:30.029 --> 02:39:30.409]  Yes, sir.
[02:39:30.629 --> 02:39:31.530]  How's Hutton doing?
[02:39:31.850 --> 02:39:32.570]  He's doing great.
[02:39:33.010 --> 02:39:34.991]  Well, tell Hutton Gibson, your neighbor, I said hi.
[02:39:35.211 --> 02:39:36.032]  I'll do that, my friend.
[02:39:36.372 --> 02:39:36.492]  Okay.
[02:39:36.512 --> 02:39:36.772]  Bye-bye.
[02:39:36.932 --> 02:39:37.352]  All right.
[02:39:38.013 --> 02:39:39.933]  Paul, any more comments about the draft?
[02:39:39.953 --> 02:39:43.495]  Then I want to take some calls and get into some of those other items you wanted to get into.
[02:39:44.674 --> 02:39:48.375]  Well, yeah, you were just talking about, you know, having to show ID to buy food.
[02:39:48.976 --> 02:39:57.339]  In every bank in Britain, there are big signs everywhere saying you must produce such and such a document to do anything.
[02:39:57.379 --> 02:40:01.020]  And one of the things that is listed is a national ID card.
[02:40:01.340 --> 02:40:03.721]  We're not even supposed to have a national ID card.
[02:40:03.941 --> 02:40:05.322]  They're still beta testing it.
[02:40:05.342 --> 02:40:06.822]  They're still trying to introduce it.
[02:40:06.862 --> 02:40:08.083]  But they have the big signs.
[02:40:08.503 --> 02:40:12.046]  They have the signs, they have the system ready in place to roll out.
[02:40:12.146 --> 02:40:16.649]  So, I mean, they're just out in the open announcing what they're about to do before they do it.
[02:40:16.829 --> 02:40:18.511]  Paul, you want to go take a photo of that?
[02:40:19.732 --> 02:40:20.092]  I will.
[02:40:21.293 --> 02:40:23.274]  It's just, you know, that's the problem.
[02:40:23.354 --> 02:40:27.637]  Five years ago, we had five or six articles a week that really showed the New World Order.
[02:40:28.198 --> 02:40:31.120]  Now, it's hundreds a day.
[02:40:31.240 --> 02:40:32.061]  I mean, it's just...
[02:40:33.360 --> 02:40:34.661]  It's wall to wall.
[02:40:34.741 --> 02:40:36.041]  Let's go to the calls.
[02:40:36.642 --> 02:40:38.202]  Let's talk to Elizabeth in Maryland.
[02:40:38.242 --> 02:40:39.143]  Elizabeth, go ahead.
[02:40:41.704 --> 02:40:42.604]  Great show, Alex.
[02:40:43.065 --> 02:40:43.285]  Thank you.
[02:40:43.305 --> 02:40:48.687]  You and Paul have such a versatility with your multifaceted media going on.
[02:40:49.748 --> 02:40:50.368]  Can you hear me?
[02:40:51.048 --> 02:40:51.589]  Yes, I can.
[02:40:51.749 --> 02:40:52.609]  Oh, okay, good.
[02:40:53.089 --> 02:40:53.830]  I want to clear up.
[02:40:53.910 --> 02:40:56.531]  I have about two points and maybe you can hold me over if need be.
[02:40:57.351 --> 02:40:58.192]  I want to clear up.
[02:40:58.332 --> 02:41:00.673]  I was too vague last week when I called you.
[02:41:01.212 --> 02:41:22.244]  When I brought something to your attention that had been on the Power Hour about Operation Noble Eagle, what I believe Captain Joyce Riley meant was that the bodies from the so-called plane crash into the Pentagon were processed at Dover, and they were all charred, and I think only one person supposedly made it there alive.
[02:41:22.584 --> 02:41:25.426]  That's what I meant, not the overall casualties in the war.
[02:41:27.047 --> 02:41:28.388]  Okay, what else is on your mind?
[02:41:28.488 --> 02:41:30.369]  Okay, now what else is on my mind?
[02:41:30.819 --> 02:41:34.541]  You know, as you sit here listening to your wonderful show, things evolve.
[02:41:34.641 --> 02:41:56.254]  You start, you're going to tell about something, then you hear something else, and something else, and now I guess what has evolved is that we're in such a serious, at such a serious juncture, pardon me, that I think something that you said early on, way back last year when I first started listening, you said if things got more desperate, you'd be sort of giving some emergency measures
[02:41:56.727 --> 02:41:59.509]  And I think the ready-reserved foods, that's wonderful.
[02:41:59.890 --> 02:42:06.956]  And when Pastor Butch came on, I might disagree with a few things about Pastor Butch, but I'm a faithful listener every night.
[02:42:07.396 --> 02:42:10.919]  And lately, Genesis has been really, it's an asset.
[02:42:10.979 --> 02:42:18.525]  He has been having many survival-type things from Bill McFarland, tells everything, and I would urge your listeners to find that.
[02:42:19.046 --> 02:42:22.869]  And so, I guess what I'm saying is, many years ago, in the 1970s,
[02:42:24.554 --> 02:42:31.341]  I saw Richard Wurmbrand, the minister from, I believe, Romania, who was imprisoned by the Communists for 14 years.
[02:42:31.781 --> 02:42:33.042]  He was just doddering.
[02:42:33.102 --> 02:42:34.804]  He could hardly sit on the stage.
[02:42:35.124 --> 02:42:38.407]  He had gone blind from being underground 14 years.
[02:42:38.868 --> 02:42:45.294]  And then I bought a book recently from Dr. Stan concerning Wurmbrand writing about Marx.
[02:42:45.414 --> 02:42:46.635]  Karl Marx was a Communist.
[02:42:47.051 --> 02:42:47.872]  And on the cover.
[02:42:48.272 --> 02:42:50.434]  It was 14 years after I had seen him.
[02:42:50.714 --> 02:42:51.735]  He was renewed.
[02:42:52.055 --> 02:42:53.176]  He was just wonderful.
[02:42:53.476 --> 02:42:57.499]  And Alex, I might not get to meet you in that coffee shop and read a book.
[02:42:57.840 --> 02:42:58.900]  This side of heaven.
[02:42:59.201 --> 02:43:00.542]  But you keep up the work.
[02:43:00.822 --> 02:43:02.523]  You encourage all of us out here.
[02:43:02.563 --> 02:43:05.906]  And at WKDI, I frequently use some of your clips.
[02:43:06.306 --> 02:43:11.570]  And I do hope we have the potential to have 2 or 3 million listeners if they turn their radios on.
[02:43:11.590 --> 02:43:14.853]  Well, that's my point is that broadcast area has that many people.
[02:43:15.073 --> 02:43:16.134]  Thanks for the call, Elizabeth.
[02:43:17.590 --> 02:43:31.285]  Yeah, Paul, I mean all the classic things that the Communists and the Fascists did to people, torturing them and then having doctors revive them to torture them some more, secret arrest, psychological testing of the whole population.
[02:43:31.726 --> 02:43:37.152]  Our government is now doing all of this, just classical tyranny, classical despotism.
[02:43:38.254 --> 02:43:39.035]  Well, that's the case.
[02:43:39.095 --> 02:43:51.348]  I mean, just as the fascists, the Gestapo, you know, first rounded up the communists, that's what's going on now with these FBI house calls where, at the moment, they're targeting, you know, anarchists or socialists.
[02:43:51.688 --> 02:43:58.255]  But if we don't stand up and say that, you know, they deserve a First Amendment right without having to put up with FBI searches,
[02:43:59.155 --> 02:44:11.101]  Then when Kerry gets in and the rhetoric changes towards conservative activists, you know, pro-life, anti-world government activists, the same program will be in place, and many of the leftists will challenge it at that point.
[02:44:11.161 --> 02:44:18.184]  So we need to stand up for the persecution of these people so it doesn't affect our rights in the future, and that's what the fascists did.
[02:44:18.224 --> 02:44:21.646]  They first rounded up the minorities and then spread it from there.
[02:44:22.626 --> 02:44:23.747]  Absolutely.
[02:44:23.927 --> 02:44:25.568]  Kara in Colorado, go ahead.
[02:44:26.263 --> 02:44:26.643]  Hi guys.
[02:44:27.364 --> 02:44:28.784]  I had a few points to make.
[02:44:28.865 --> 02:44:52.218]  One of them was our ABC, local ABC affiliate just recently had a news story on about IDs and there's some kind of pamphlet that bar owners have that they're able to bust kids, college kids primarily, that have fake IDs from, for example, different states like New York or, you know, different places just all over the country.
[02:44:52.798 --> 02:44:55.260]  And at the end of the story, the anchor came back on and said,
[02:44:56.331 --> 02:45:03.101]  That the federal government is looking to possibly standardize state IDs and there might even be a national ID card coming up.
[02:45:03.281 --> 02:45:05.745]  And, you know, just said really casually and stuff like that.
[02:45:05.785 --> 02:45:07.888]  Of course, it's for our protection and stuff like that.
[02:45:08.416 --> 02:45:17.320]  Yeah, it's for terrorism, it's to stop the kids, it's going to be great, and by the way, with the new national sales tax, you'll have to swipe it each time you make a purchase, but that's all part of freedom.
[02:45:17.660 --> 02:45:17.900]  Right.
[02:45:18.380 --> 02:45:23.883]  The other thing I wanted to mention, well, one of the other things I wanted to mention had to do with the Venezuelan election.
[02:45:24.363 --> 02:45:26.884]  Alex, I don't know whether you mentioned it, but... Yeah, the neocons are going.
[02:45:26.924 --> 02:45:29.745]  They used evil electronic voting machines with no record.
[02:45:30.186 --> 02:45:31.326]  The election's no good.
[02:45:31.346 --> 02:45:33.267]  Well, then why are the same systems good here?
[02:45:33.767 --> 02:45:34.688]  Right, exactly.
[02:45:34.928 --> 02:45:48.458]  And I read that it was a company named Smartmatic, and nobody's ever heard of them, they've never done this before, and supposedly they can print out the ballots unlike, as the article said, most of the machines in the United States.
[02:45:48.498 --> 02:45:50.220]  Yeah, their machines are better than ours.
[02:45:50.971 --> 02:45:55.339]  But their machines no good, but we can trust our good machines here.
[02:45:55.720 --> 02:45:56.542]  Absolutely.
[02:45:57.103 --> 02:46:02.713]  And another thing I want to mention about our local Denver Community Television, DCTV.
[02:46:04.079 --> 02:46:07.702]  They are supposedly slated to shut down at the end of the year.
[02:46:07.722 --> 02:46:11.305]  So I just wanted to point that out in light of what's going on.
[02:46:11.365 --> 02:46:15.028]  Why are people letting Denver shut down your AXS TV?
[02:46:15.268 --> 02:46:16.970]  It has to do with cost.
[02:46:17.490 --> 02:46:18.471]  Yeah, sure, sure.
[02:46:19.051 --> 02:46:22.834]  Look, our station has more money than ever, but they're still trying to shut it down.
[02:46:23.055 --> 02:46:23.855]  Oh, I know, I know.
[02:46:23.935 --> 02:46:30.040]  One of the things I want to do, Alex, is air your comprehensive annual financial report tape on it.
[02:46:30.140 --> 02:46:32.963]  And I was going to ask you if you have any particular release
[02:46:33.403 --> 02:46:34.444]  That I need to get from you?
[02:46:34.524 --> 02:46:35.024]  No, no.
[02:46:35.084 --> 02:46:39.486]  I mean, look, just write out that you have permission and sign my name on that baby.
[02:46:39.726 --> 02:46:40.026]  Okay.
[02:46:40.346 --> 02:46:41.186]  Alright.
[02:46:41.226 --> 02:46:43.347]  Get all my videos on before they shut it down.
[02:46:43.407 --> 02:46:44.688]  At least somebody will see the truth.
[02:46:44.848 --> 02:46:45.368]  Absolutely.
[02:46:45.428 --> 02:46:46.589]  One last thing real quick.
[02:46:47.849 --> 02:46:52.271]  About a month or so before the war started, I kept forgetting to mention this to you, Alex.
[02:46:53.251 --> 02:46:56.392]  I heard really strange sounding things.
[02:46:57.353 --> 02:47:02.775]  I went out to my hometown, which is northeast Colorado, and it's real quiet out there.
[02:47:02.795 --> 02:47:08.337]  It's very far removed from any metro areas, and my house is definitely far removed from the highway.
[02:47:08.977 --> 02:47:13.799]  And I slept there one night with the window open, and I heard these sounds.
[02:47:13.899 --> 02:47:15.960]  It sounded like kind of a roar and a pop.
[02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:26.546]  And, um, I believe what that was, and I wondered if you'd ever heard this before, was perhaps jets training supersonic in the vicinity?
[02:47:26.626 --> 02:47:28.507]  Well, sure, yeah, that happens all the time.
[02:47:28.527 --> 02:47:30.388]  Thanks for the call, Tara.
[02:47:30.668 --> 02:47:31.708]  Brock in Rhode Island.
[02:47:31.728 --> 02:47:32.509]  Go ahead, Brock.
[02:47:33.069 --> 02:47:34.030]  Or, Brooke, excuse me.
[02:47:34.370 --> 02:47:34.890]  Hi, Alex.
[02:47:35.110 --> 02:47:36.431]  This is Brooke in Providence.
[02:47:37.231 --> 02:47:43.154]  I just wanted to speak to you about your previous caller who called in about Arnold.
[02:47:43.555 --> 02:47:43.835]  Yes.
[02:47:45.069 --> 02:47:50.533]  In the nineties, or eight years of the nineties, I was a personal assistant to a Hollywood producer.
[02:47:51.254 --> 02:47:54.096]  So I guess you might say I was close to the insiders.
[02:47:54.897 --> 02:48:02.082]  And I have seen just about everything that you have spoken about on your program involving many of these people.
[02:48:03.463 --> 02:48:06.826]  And I knew a personal trainer at Gold's Gym.
[02:48:08.087 --> 02:48:11.330]  And as a matter of fact, he's The Rock's personal trainer.
[02:48:12.211 --> 02:48:15.613]  And, uh, he said The Rock was a great guy, a real nice guy.
[02:48:16.194 --> 02:48:19.076]  But, um, he told me a lot of things about Arnold.
[02:48:19.636 --> 02:48:24.279]  And I always liked Arnold, so I was kind of mind-blown about all the things he told me.
[02:48:24.559 --> 02:48:26.160]  And then he said to read this book.
[02:48:26.741 --> 02:48:28.622]  And he said it'll confirm everything.
[02:48:29.483 --> 02:48:30.363]  So I read the book.
[02:48:30.443 --> 02:48:32.325]  Well, I'll tell you what, stay there and we'll talk about it.
[02:48:32.745 --> 02:48:36.247]  But don't talk bad about Hitler or you'll be listed as anti-Semitic.
[02:48:36.828 --> 02:48:37.428]  I'm not kidding!
[02:48:38.450 --> 02:48:39.831]  Hitler's good, according to Arnold.
[02:48:40.011 --> 02:48:42.892]  I disagree with him, so I'm bad, but so what?
[02:48:42.952 --> 02:48:43.792]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:44.693 --> 02:48:51.535]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:51.836 --> 02:48:53.216]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[02:48:53.416 --> 02:48:55.617]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:55.757 --> 02:48:57.858]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:58.138 --> 02:49:03.080]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:03.400 --> 02:49:07.442]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:07.682 --> 02:49:09.464]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:09.544 --> 02:49:20.196]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:20.336 --> 02:49:22.219]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:49:22.619 --> 02:49:26.260]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today and man the guns in the Info Wars.
[02:49:26.380 --> 02:49:27.940]  Order right now by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:49:27.960 --> 02:49:28.360]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:49:28.380 --> 02:49:30.281]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[02:49:30.381 --> 02:49:31.241]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[02:49:43.914 --> 02:49:50.158]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:49:50.278 --> 02:49:56.461]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:49:56.742 --> 02:50:05.167]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:50:05.427 --> 02:50:12.451]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:50:12.731 --> 02:50:17.574]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:50:17.774 --> 02:50:23.198]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:50:23.538 --> 02:50:26.620]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:50:26.941 --> 02:50:34.906]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:34.946 --> 02:50:35.526]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:50:45.073 --> 02:50:45.393]  I think so.
[02:51:00.302 --> 02:51:00.962]  We're good to go!
[02:51:29.827 --> 02:51:32.928]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:33.089 --> 02:51:39.031]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:49.376 --> 02:51:58.000]  Alright, I want to hit a couple of final news stories, but I was talking to Brooke during the break about the Arnold book, and yes, I've even seen that in a few newspapers.
[02:51:58.777 --> 02:52:02.840]  Well you know Alex, a lot of my Hollywood connections seem to match
[02:52:23.886 --> 02:52:28.669]  Um, time frames that you speak of, like my boss knew Lord Montague.
[02:52:29.590 --> 02:52:35.754]  And, uh, every time Lord Montague would come to California would be in the July 15th time frame.
[02:52:36.354 --> 02:52:40.216]  And he, the roost was always the Pebble Beach Antique Auto Show.
[02:52:41.898 --> 02:52:47.161]  And I think a lot... Yeah, but, but, but during the break, I mean, you were talking about the, the Arnold book, about how Arnold really got his start.
[02:52:47.699 --> 02:52:56.968]  Yeah, in the Arnold book it says that Arnold was servicing a lot of the old men in the bodybuilding community that were sponsors.
[02:52:57.269 --> 02:52:58.610]  You know, all the rich guys.
[02:52:58.990 --> 02:53:01.513]  And that Arnold had no compunction about doing that.
[02:53:01.833 --> 02:53:03.154]  That that was okay with him.
[02:53:03.174 --> 02:53:05.917]  That basically Arnold is a total opportunist.
[02:53:05.937 --> 02:53:09.661]  He'll do anything to advance himself and his agenda.
[02:53:10.427 --> 02:53:13.971]  Now, I've even seen that in the newspapers over the years, but all of that's ignored.
[02:53:14.071 --> 02:53:20.799]  Saying he loves Hitler, saying he loves Kurt Voltheim, saying he hates black people in front of 2,000 people, that's all okay.
[02:53:21.519 --> 02:53:22.781]  Paul Watson, why is that?
[02:53:24.142 --> 02:53:36.367]  Well, it's okay, you know, that he was posed in gay magazines, and in fact he's still in this organization called US English, which is led by an admitted neo-Nazi, and that's just one of the groups.
[02:53:36.407 --> 02:53:39.028]  I mean, he admits injecting drugs in the past.
[02:53:39.068 --> 02:53:48.412]  They're very, very conservative, but you know, the New York Times came out and issued a retraction that Arnold ever said he admired Hitler.
[02:53:48.452 --> 02:53:48.932]  So, I mean,
[02:53:50.259 --> 02:53:55.121]  Wait a minute, MSNBC got that on videotape and that was an outtake from Pumping Iron!
[02:53:55.441 --> 02:54:01.984]  Well, what they did is they took the transcript from Pumping Iron and changed it so that Arnold said, I didn't admire Hitler.
[02:54:02.024 --> 02:54:05.785]  And then the New York Times reported on the transcript and not the actual film.
[02:54:06.266 --> 02:54:10.047]  So that was, that was the, you know, the makeup of the retraction.
[02:54:10.848 --> 02:54:14.789]  Well, he said on MSNBC television, I don't care if Kirk's a Nazi, I love him.
[02:54:15.990 --> 02:54:16.490]  I mean, I mean...
[02:54:17.717 --> 02:54:18.397]  Oh, please.
[02:54:18.717 --> 02:54:28.680]  Well, you know, the point you made, uh, Brooke, about the Arnold book, which I didn't read many years ago, uh, he, he never sued that lady who wrote a best-selling book saying all this?
[02:54:29.260 --> 02:54:30.460]  No, he never sued anyone.
[02:54:30.480 --> 02:54:37.502]  He never sued the people that mentioned, there were names mentioned as to who he serviced in that book, and it was men and women.
[02:54:38.718 --> 02:54:39.899]  Arnold didn't really care.
[02:54:39.919 --> 02:54:42.200]  He did everything to advance himself.
[02:54:42.240 --> 02:54:43.581]  He's a total opportunist.
[02:54:43.661 --> 02:54:45.102]  He's very Masonic.
[02:54:45.162 --> 02:54:47.323]  He's like all the people you talk about.
[02:54:47.343 --> 02:54:48.944]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:49.245 --> 02:54:49.965]  Gotta let you go.
[02:54:49.985 --> 02:54:51.266]  We're out of time, folks.
[02:54:51.326 --> 02:54:51.686]  Poll over.
[02:54:51.726 --> 02:54:52.787]  A couple other news items.
[02:54:52.807 --> 02:54:53.367]  Go ahead and hit them.
[02:54:54.780 --> 02:54:58.764]  Just the thing about the national ID card being proposed by the 9-11 panel.
[02:54:59.264 --> 02:55:10.553]  Again, they're going back to the argument of saying, well, people already use their driver's license and birth certificate as a national ID, so why not just roll the thing into a centralized database?
[02:55:10.573 --> 02:55:13.536]  But really, they've already standardized almost all the states years ago.
[02:55:14.597 --> 02:55:16.598]  Yes, I mean, that's the argument they're using.
[02:55:16.638 --> 02:55:18.500]  They're just saying, let's go to the next stage.
[02:55:19.233 --> 02:55:27.201]  And the FBI calling on protesters, and it's actually being conducted under the auspices of the Joint Terrorism Task Force.
[02:55:27.562 --> 02:55:36.691]  So again, we've seen that same benchmark all along, linking protesting against the government with terrorism, and the same thing has happened in Britain and Canada.
[02:55:38.212 --> 02:55:43.715]  People get arrested for heckling Bush at high school speech functions.
[02:55:43.915 --> 02:55:48.998]  A graphic designer from Charleston turned up for work the next day, found out he was fired.
[02:55:50.538 --> 02:56:01.905]  Again, in the same article, it points out another example where at Bush's July 4th rally, a couple of people wearing t-shirts that said, Love America, Hate Bush, were also arrested.
[02:56:02.645 --> 02:56:03.986]  And so now they're going round
[02:56:04.731 --> 02:56:10.455]  And the 40 to 50 organizers of the upcoming protest at the Republican Convention.
[02:56:10.516 --> 02:56:11.536]  And trying to intimidate them.
[02:56:11.696 --> 02:56:12.777]  We're out of time, Paul.
[02:56:12.797 --> 02:56:19.082]  People are going to get a chance to hear you all next week with reports with our fill-in host, as I call on the reports from New York.
[02:56:19.102 --> 02:56:19.983]  So folks will hear you then.
[02:56:20.003 --> 02:56:20.743]  Thanks for coming on.
[02:56:21.024 --> 02:56:21.484]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:56:22.233 --> 02:56:23.075]  All right, my friends.
[02:56:23.135 --> 02:56:26.280]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight central on the shortwave at 3210.
[02:56:26.621 --> 02:56:28.083]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2, 9475.
[02:56:29.646 --> 02:56:33.072]  And your local AM and FM dial or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:56:33.493 --> 02:56:34.414]  God bless you all.
