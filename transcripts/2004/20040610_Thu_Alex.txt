[00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.211]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.851 --> 00:00:07.932]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.632 --> 00:00:09.733]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.393 --> 00:00:11.193]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.974 --> 00:00:12.874]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.534 --> 00:00:17.216]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:21.779]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.286 --> 00:00:34.226]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:34.286 --> 00:00:37.687]  Thank you for joining us on this live Thursday edition.
[00:00:39.728 --> 00:00:41.208]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:41.388 --> 00:00:47.470]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.071]  And now we're going to dive straight into the news.
[00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:56.612]  We have some guests coming up, I'll tell you about a little bit later as well.
[00:00:57.773 --> 00:01:02.854]  Well, first off, I should just say, if you're joining us for the first time, this show is not left-wing, it's not right-wing.
[00:01:03.962 --> 00:01:05.342]  We're constitutionalists.
[00:01:05.522 --> 00:01:06.523]  I believe in freedom.
[00:01:07.203 --> 00:01:08.443]  I love America.
[00:01:09.884 --> 00:01:10.924]  I want justice.
[00:01:11.984 --> 00:01:16.505]  I want to stop the organized crime syndicate that is the New World Order.
[00:01:17.906 --> 00:01:22.587]  And I want everybody, regardless of race, color, creed, to be able to live together in happiness
[00:01:23.243 --> 00:01:34.485]  But that's not going to happen because the New World Order is there manipulating all the different sides to create a crisis, to create chaos, so they can give us their order.
[00:01:35.906 --> 00:01:43.447]  Rumsfeld, who ordered the torture, which is now admitted, to become new head of the investigation into it.
[00:01:43.607 --> 00:01:45.408]  This is from ABC News.
[00:01:47.848 --> 00:01:51.049]  Of course, I should add that that's Australian news.
[00:01:52.288 --> 00:01:54.950]  Same as ABC News, it's national news in Australia.
[00:01:56.171 --> 00:02:04.376]  And at the same time, Rumsfeld told officers to take gloves off with the American Taliban member, Mr. Lind.
[00:02:05.257 --> 00:02:06.918]  And I remember that at the time!
[00:02:07.338 --> 00:02:11.020]  We've taken the gloves off, we're interrogating him very strenuously.
[00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:13.362]  This was all public.
[00:02:14.073 --> 00:02:28.961]  And so now it's being pointed out, John Walker Lynn, the so-called American Taliban, was stripped naked and tied to a stretcher during interrogation after the Office of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld ordered intelligence officers to quote, take off the gloves when questioning him.
[00:02:29.864 --> 00:02:30.404]  That's a quote.
[00:02:30.764 --> 00:02:40.909]  Mr. Rumsfeld's legal counsel instructed the officers to push the limits when questioning Lind, captured in Afghanistan with Taliban and Al Qaeda forces in late 2001.
[00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.212]  The treatment of Lind appears to foreshadow the abuse of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib.
[00:02:48.693 --> 00:02:56.197]  Folks, the real Taliban and Al Qaeda, 8,000 of them, were flown out to safety out of Afghanistan.
[00:02:58.894 --> 00:02:59.934]  It's that simple.
[00:03:01.875 --> 00:03:03.915]  They were flown out to safety.
[00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:05.096]  They were CIA.
[00:03:05.436 --> 00:03:17.159]  But then they grabbed up little nobodies off the streets, off of the desert roads and mountain passes of Afghanistan and took them to Camp X-Ray for torture.
[00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:22.380]  Took them to the different camps in Afghanistan, not just in Cuba.
[00:03:23.323 --> 00:03:25.704]  And have been torturing the living daylights out of them.
[00:03:25.724 --> 00:03:32.147]  Their own top general quit a year and a half ago, Brigadier General Rick Baucus, refusing to go along with all of this.
[00:03:33.328 --> 00:03:36.689]  But don't worry, now Rumsfeld's going to do the investigation.
[00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:52.497]  By the way, about a month ago, there was a report by Judicial Watch, far from, you know, evil liberals out to get Bush, you know, the folks that successfully went after Bill Clinton,
[00:03:54.498 --> 00:04:02.000]  A Freedom of Information Act request, they did over ten of them to the FBI, Defense Intelligence, CIA.
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:16.025]  They all refused, but the Customs Department did release the documents with over 160 of the Bin Laden family being flown out of the country on three separate flights, September 11th, 12th, and 13th.
[00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:25.695]  Finally today, in the several major Florida newspapers, including the St.
[00:04:25.735 --> 00:04:32.459]  Petersburg newspaper, they actually have copies of those documents published.
[00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:39.623]  Now again, a month ago we covered this and posted the documents, but finally it hit some major newspapers, which is news in and of itself.
[00:04:40.023 --> 00:04:45.827]  So, that's on PrisonPlanet.com for you right now as well.
[00:04:48.661 --> 00:04:53.385]  When we get back, we'll get into, um, just, oh, there's so much news here.
[00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:57.187]  Baltimore's set for 24 hour a day homeland security camera surveillance.
[00:04:57.808 --> 00:04:58.849]  What's going on in Iraq?
[00:04:58.889 --> 00:04:59.269]  You name it.
[00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.611]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:05:02.771 --> 00:05:03.912]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:05:04.092 --> 00:05:07.495]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:05:07.615 --> 00:05:08.055]  Phenol.
[00:05:08.355 --> 00:05:15.421]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:19.864]  The FDA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:05:19.964 --> 00:05:20.424]  Fragrance?
[00:05:20.784 --> 00:05:25.547]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:05:25.687 --> 00:05:30.370]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.172]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Calben shampoo.
[00:05:33.412 --> 00:05:36.835]  Well, like all of the products from the Calben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:05:36.975 --> 00:05:40.477]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:05:40.717 --> 00:05:43.080]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.121]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:06:02.824 --> 00:06:09.106]  Terrorism, chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:06:09.366 --> 00:06:10.946]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:06:11.206 --> 00:06:13.687]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:14.067 --> 00:06:28.631]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:28.991]  government.

[00:07:00.535 --> 00:07:04.864]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:07:05.065 --> 00:07:09.414]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:11.954 --> 00:07:14.035]  This disaster is a new world order.
[00:07:14.115 --> 00:07:15.475]  A new world order?
[00:07:16.136 --> 00:07:16.856]  Panama.
[00:07:17.176 --> 00:07:21.398]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:21.458 --> 00:07:28.381]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:28.521 --> 00:07:30.522]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:30.762 --> 00:07:41.230]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:46.894]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:07:50.817 --> 00:07:51.158]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:51.178 --> 00:07:52.459]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:08:02.378 --> 00:08:08.399]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.999 --> 00:08:12.060]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:21.641 --> 00:08:30.903]  One of the individuals that's going to be eulogizing Ronald Reagan is Missouri Senator
[00:08:31.989 --> 00:08:33.010]  John Danforth.
[00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:59.647]  And remember during the whole Waco investigation, or whitewash, in the late 1990s, Janet Reno, who ran the Waco attack with the Delta Force and elements of foreign military as well, she said, oh yes, it's an independent investigation, and her Justice Department appointed Danforth, and then her aides were his assistants, and they called this an independent
[00:09:01.138 --> 00:09:09.343]  Investigation of Waco and Danforth ran an incredible soft-soap cover-up of the entire operation.
[00:09:10.404 --> 00:09:11.885]  It was just, it was amazing.
[00:09:12.754 --> 00:09:30.829]  And then now with the 9-11 Commission, we have all these different Bush business partners and Bin Laden family business partners and Condoleezza Rice business partners up there sitting in judgment and putting out their report yesterday saying no fault of Clinton, no fault of Bush protecting Al Qaeda.
[00:09:31.309 --> 00:09:33.731]  It's all the CIA and FBI's fault.
[00:09:33.811 --> 00:09:36.373]  They're just idiots and they need more funding and more power.
[00:09:36.673 --> 00:09:37.554]  That'll punish them.
[00:09:40.419 --> 00:09:51.307]  And now, Rumsfeld, according to ABC News, Rumsfeld, who ordered the torture to become new head of the investigation into it.
[00:09:51.427 --> 00:09:51.627]  U.S.
[00:09:51.667 --> 00:10:00.073]  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is expected to replace the two-star general investigating the prisoner abuse scandal at Iraq's Abu Ghraib jail
[00:10:00.908 --> 00:10:06.491]  With a more senior officer than the New York Times reported, the senior officer will report directly to Rumsfeld.
[00:10:07.031 --> 00:10:12.854]  Defense officials told the Daily that General John Abizid, commander of U.S.
[00:10:12.894 --> 00:10:22.499]  forces in the Middle East, has asked for the change because Army regulations prevent the investigator, General George Fay, from interviewing his superiors.
[00:10:23.217 --> 00:10:31.566]  General Fay has said he could not complete the investigation without interviewing the ground commander in Iraq, Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez.
[00:10:32.148 --> 00:10:37.810]  Lieutenant General Sanchez has recused himself as the reviewing authority for General Fay's report.
[00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:51.056]  The Daily says that he has asked General Abizid, I'm sorry if I mispronounced that, Abizida, or however you pronounce it, I can't pronounce it, that a higher ranking officer be appointed to conduct a review in the investigation.
[00:10:51.096 --> 00:10:55.898]  Defense officials say the General made the request of Mr. Rumsfeld, who will most likely approve it.
[00:10:56.647 --> 00:11:08.697]  The Daily has been told that General Fay's final report is delayed by 30 days as an important witness who has refused to cooperate, has changed his mind, and agreed to work more closely with investigators, with whitewashers.
[00:11:09.098 --> 00:11:15.363]  The identity of the witness has not been revealed, and Army officials insist General Sanchez is not a target of the investigation.
[00:11:16.704 --> 00:11:24.531]  But it goes on to say that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is running the investigation through these generals out of his office.
[00:11:26.597 --> 00:11:32.983]  It's like having Jeffrey Dahmer be the prosecutor and the judge in the Jeffrey Dahmer case.
[00:11:33.043 --> 00:11:34.324]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[00:11:35.545 --> 00:11:45.794]  We all know that Rumsfeld got up on TV and bragged about torture, and that the CIA bragged about it, and there were a hundred editorials, if there weren't two hundred, lauding the virtues of torture.
[00:11:45.814 --> 00:11:49.758]  That was a New York Times headline in the last two and a half years.
[00:11:50.218 --> 00:11:53.441]  And then now we're all shocked when we see the images of the torture.
[00:11:55.689 --> 00:11:57.490]  And here's another one out of London Independent.
[00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.231]  Rumsfeld told officers to take gloves off with Lind.
[00:12:01.311 --> 00:12:02.451]  And we already went over some of this.
[00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:05.132]  The supposed, you know, Taliban, American Taliban.
[00:12:05.152 --> 00:12:09.013]  And Rumsfeld, it's now admitted by the CIA and the Pentagon.
[00:12:09.593 --> 00:12:10.413]  This is being leaked.
[00:12:10.533 --> 00:12:13.174]  Documents seen by Los Angeles Times show that when a U.S.
[00:12:13.254 --> 00:12:22.237]  Army intelligence officer started to question Lind, he was given instructions that the Secretary of Defense Counsel has authorized him to take the gloves off and ask whether he
[00:12:23.526 --> 00:12:24.647]  And ask whatever he wanted.
[00:12:25.127 --> 00:12:30.151]  The documents show that in the early stages, Lind's response were cable to Washington every hour.
[00:12:32.633 --> 00:12:37.617]  And it says that Lind initially pled not guilty, but he later admitted reduced charges and was sentenced to 20 years.
[00:12:38.117 --> 00:12:41.519]  He and his lawyers also agreed to drop claims that he had been tortured by a U.S.
[00:12:41.559 --> 00:12:42.140]  personnel.
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:43.381]  I don't know.
[00:12:43.401 --> 00:12:49.165]  I mean, he was stripped naked for the 20-plus hour flight, chained down on a metal plank.
[00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:50.466]  I mean, that's torture enough.
[00:12:51.943 --> 00:13:02.751]  I mean, they publicly put these people in hoods, mask over their mouths, earplugs, bow on their hands, chain them down, squatting on their knees for days.
[00:13:03.172 --> 00:13:05.714]  That's one of the most severe forms of torture, my friends.
[00:13:05.954 --> 00:13:12.399]  You try doing it for ten minutes and then add the sensory deprivation and see if you don't go crazy.
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.221]  But the torture's a lot worse than that.
[00:13:15.261 --> 00:13:18.083]  I mean, there's stuff they've done that's admitted that I can't even talk about on air.
[00:13:18.143 --> 00:13:19.484]  It's so pornographic in nature.
[00:13:21.815 --> 00:13:30.657]  But it's the same old story, whether it's Waco, 9-11, Oklahoma City, or the torture scandal, the foxes are guarding the hen house.
[00:13:30.777 --> 00:13:38.518]  The foxes have appointed weasels to sit in trial of them, of their treatment of the hens.
[00:13:40.498 --> 00:13:42.879]  People could say, well, we're in a war, we gotta torture.
[00:13:42.899 --> 00:13:43.919]  You know, that's been the M.O.
[00:13:43.959 --> 00:13:44.579]  we've all heard.
[00:13:45.099 --> 00:13:47.760]  But I thought we took over Saddam because he tortured.
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.380]  I thought the Taliban were bad because they tortured.
[00:13:50.988 --> 00:13:53.408]  I thought torture was back as Joseph Mengele did it.
[00:13:53.749 --> 00:14:16.533]  I know I talk a lot about torture, but in a society where they come out and say they're torturing people and it's good, then we see the images of it, then they try to deny it, and there's this memory hole, to use the Orwellian term, of just day-to-day stories changing 180 degrees, and this isn't being pointed out by the mainstream media.
[00:14:16.953 --> 00:14:18.193]  It needs to be pointed out.
[00:14:21.392 --> 00:14:27.916]  Very, very serious to be facing this, and I don't know, what's your take on it?
[00:14:29.256 --> 00:14:32.498]  Rumsfeld investigating himself, but clearly it isn't just Rumsfeld.
[00:14:34.779 --> 00:14:44.565]  And in this London Independent article, it talks about how the council, Rumsfeld's council, was saying, yeah, go ahead and torture him, do whatever you want, take the gloves off.
[00:14:44.925 --> 00:14:50.588]  Well, it's the same Pentagon council saying, Rumsfeld says that Bush is above any federal or international law.
[00:14:51.903 --> 00:14:53.906]  And that we can torture whoever we want.
[00:14:53.926 --> 00:14:56.289]  I mean, those actual memos are now public.
[00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:58.431]  Sections of them.
[00:14:58.832 --> 00:15:03.838]  Attorney General Ashcroft and Rumsfeld are blocking the other releases of other memos.
[00:15:04.579 --> 00:15:05.841]  And of the full memos.
[00:15:06.862 --> 00:15:08.384]  So we have them doing this.
[00:15:08.424 --> 00:15:09.325]  I mean, it's confirmed.
[00:15:10.057 --> 00:15:12.018]  And the question is, will they be held accountable?
[00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:22.581]  Because if they aren't held accountable, and they just burn a few patsies who followed orders, and that doesn't abstain them from guilt either, then it sets the precedent for the globalists to continue torture on a mass scale.
[00:15:22.861 --> 00:15:28.483]  What we're seeing is the process of legitimizing torture.
[00:15:29.864 --> 00:15:36.666]  And I've talked ad nauseum about how every time I turn television on, and I literally don't watch more than an hour a week,
[00:15:37.956 --> 00:15:50.672]  But every time I'm in a restaurant and a big screen TV is on, or I'm at the local TV station and they've got monitors on with different channels, and I stop and watch five minutes of Keith or Sutherland's 24, ABC News' Threat Matrix,
[00:15:52.248 --> 00:15:54.990]  Or The Shield or any of these shows.
[00:15:55.130 --> 00:16:00.835]  Every time I turn the TV on and flip through channels, the police are torturing some drug dealer and it's good.
[00:16:01.135 --> 00:16:02.016]  Torture's good.
[00:16:02.036 --> 00:16:06.120]  They've got some supposed terrorist in a torture chair electrocuting him.
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.801]  And you know, they're the good guys.
[00:16:07.841 --> 00:16:08.762]  They have to do it.
[00:16:08.822 --> 00:16:10.644]  You know, they're sad they have to do it.
[00:16:11.084 --> 00:16:14.887]  I mean, this is a mass program of warping our minds.
[00:16:14.988 --> 00:16:16.269]  And we have to say no.
[00:16:16.609 --> 00:16:18.651]  We have to say no, torture's wrong.
[00:16:19.191 --> 00:16:28.575]  It's like saying to Hitler, no it's wrong to shut down these businesses of people you don't like and to arrest your political enemies and to put them in slave labor camps.
[00:16:28.835 --> 00:16:36.438]  If somebody would have been there and said no and stood up and admitted what was happening early on, Hitler wouldn't have been able to get away with what he did!
[00:16:41.775 --> 00:16:53.301]  You know, if we stood up and said no to what Israel's doing, torturing living daylights, they admit they torture people in their hundreds of huge prisons, including Israelis that refuse to be conscripted.
[00:16:54.462 --> 00:17:06.849]  If people in Israel more aggressively stood up and pointed out what's even been admitted in Haraz and in the Jerusalem Post, that the Israeli government has been behind a lot of the terror attacks, then that would stop.
[00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:10.511]  If we stood up and pointed out that our government's behind the terror attacks,
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.061]  Then it would stop.
[00:17:12.141 --> 00:17:19.211]  If we stood up and exposed that the British MI6 and MI5 are admittedly behind many of the terror attacks, it would stop.
[00:17:19.271 --> 00:17:20.593]  They would lose that power.
[00:17:21.955 --> 00:17:27.903]  If more Russians stood up against Putin, which basically now is too late, and exposed the fact that he's been behind the terrorism.
[00:17:29.855 --> 00:17:31.196]  Then that country could be free.
[00:17:31.236 --> 00:17:33.356]  But they decided, oh, you can't fight City Hall.
[00:17:33.697 --> 00:17:35.277]  You know, that's just a way of life in Russia.
[00:17:35.477 --> 00:17:36.438]  So they're slaves now.
[00:17:36.478 --> 00:17:37.598]  They were slaves a year ago.
[00:17:37.638 --> 00:17:39.319]  They were slaves a hundred years ago.
[00:17:39.499 --> 00:17:41.119]  They'll be slaves a hundred years from now.
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:52.124]  But in America, we had a different history of, yes, we had a lot of evils and a lot of problems, but we had a way of standing up against them and defeating those evils.
[00:17:52.644 --> 00:17:55.105]  But not anymore, because it's the age of the yuppie.
[00:17:56.098 --> 00:17:58.319]  The age of people thinking they're part of the system!
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:06.064]  The age of rationalizing what's happening and being in deep denial!
[00:18:07.605 --> 00:18:08.966]  You gotta get out of that denial!
[00:18:08.986 --> 00:18:13.409]  Alright, we're gonna come back and take calls, then I'll get back in the news when you have some guests coming up.
[00:18:13.809 --> 00:18:15.730]  The total free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:15.811]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:18:23.962 --> 00:18:33.224]  And again, if you want to read all the news we've been covering and are going to cover, it's all posted at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:18:33.264 --> 00:18:37.885]  And I just want to say that my wife, the webmaster of InfoWars.com, does a fabulous job.
[00:18:37.925 --> 00:18:38.926]  Violet does a great job.
[00:18:39.366 --> 00:18:49.348]  And Paul Watson, my webmaster for the Prison Planet side of things, is doing just an exemplary, superb job on those websites, and we really appreciate his work on that.
[00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:55.619]  And in the Nazi USA section, exposing the Nazi-style government,
[00:18:56.583 --> 00:19:11.288]  We have the Brave New World section as a subsection, and in that, there's the vaccine section about the cancer viruses, the mercury in the vaccines, the population control programs.
[00:19:11.808 --> 00:19:19.231]  It's all there for you, but we're going to put a link on the main page to that sub-directory, so it's a little bit easier for you to find.
[00:19:19.551 --> 00:19:22.732]  And yesterday, for some reason, we didn't get that National Geographic
[00:19:24.085 --> 00:19:29.647]  photo of the satanic ritual at Bohemian Grove posted, though a lot of you saw it on the National Geographic website.
[00:19:29.907 --> 00:19:31.428]  Well, it is posted now.
[00:19:32.728 --> 00:19:33.128]  Okay.
[00:19:34.869 --> 00:19:37.610]  And, uh, so you need to go check that out.
[00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:44.573]  Alright, we'll come back and go to your calls and we'll get to, uh, just, oh, there's so much here.
[00:19:44.733 --> 00:19:48.294]  Baltimore set for 24-hour Homeland Security camera surveillance.
[00:19:48.774 --> 00:19:50.975]  Occupation tanks poised to enter Fallujah.
[00:19:51.894 --> 00:19:52.637]  Fourteen U.S.
[00:19:52.677 --> 00:19:53.962]  soldiers killed in an attack.
[00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.657]  And some censorship news too.
[00:20:02.495 --> 00:20:06.998]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:20:07.339 --> 00:20:11.442]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:20:11.722 --> 00:20:12.282]  We listened.
[00:20:12.583 --> 00:20:17.566]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:20:17.847 --> 00:20:18.327]  We listened.
[00:20:18.707 --> 00:20:21.750]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:22.730]  We listened.
[00:20:23.171 --> 00:20:27.214]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:20:27.654 --> 00:20:28.094]  We listened.
[00:20:28.435 --> 00:20:33.680]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:20:34.101 --> 00:20:35.462]  Again, we listened.
[00:20:35.823 --> 00:20:43.210]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:20:43.591 --> 00:20:46.734]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by
[00:21:01.395 --> 00:21:05.056]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:21:05.476 --> 00:21:10.899]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:21:11.359 --> 00:21:12.439]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:21:12.479 --> 00:21:16.461]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:21:17.168 --> 00:21:30.460]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:21:30.981 --> 00:21:36.285]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:21:36.586 --> 00:21:42.491]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:21:43.214 --> 00:21:45.015]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:46.075 --> 00:21:49.237]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:21:49.677 --> 00:21:50.858]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:52.778 --> 00:21:55.860]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:56.300]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:04.044]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[00:22:12.506 --> 00:22:22.170]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:29.732]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.
[00:22:30.653 --> 00:22:39.436]  We would like to send you a one-year absolutely free subscription to Newswatch Magazine that gives you the background of what is happening in America.
[00:22:40.089 --> 00:22:41.590]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:41.910]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:42.090]  Call now.
[00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:47.474]  Our operators are standing by for an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[00:23:00.359 --> 00:23:02.060]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.641]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[00:23:04.821 --> 00:23:05.521]  It feels great.
[00:23:05.701 --> 00:23:06.762]  Absolutely wonderful.
[00:23:06.842 --> 00:23:12.364]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:23:12.685 --> 00:23:14.185]  Kimberly, tell us about your success.
[00:23:14.445 --> 00:23:16.827]  Okay, I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[00:23:16.967 --> 00:23:20.068]  I've lost 16 pounds and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[00:23:20.268 --> 00:23:20.929]  Incredible.
[00:23:21.129 --> 00:23:22.351]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[00:23:22.391 --> 00:23:26.095]  I have a 21-month-old child, and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[00:23:26.195 --> 00:23:26.996]  Well, that's for sure.
[00:23:27.156 --> 00:23:27.737]  Was it easy?
[00:23:27.957 --> 00:23:28.558]  Very easy.
[00:23:28.618 --> 00:23:29.479]  I mean, there's nothing to it.
[00:23:29.519 --> 00:23:34.684]  You can actually still continue to eat meals with your children and not starve yourself or anything else and lose weight.
[00:23:35.245 --> 00:23:41.170]  You can lose fat the safe and healthy way, just like Kimberly did with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:42.691]  Call right now 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:23:42.731 --> 00:23:43.432]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:23:43.452 --> 00:23:47.455]  Remember, mention you heard it right here, and that gets you $25 off a three-month supply.
[00:23:47.636 --> 00:23:48.957]  So call Vim and Vigor today 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:23:48.977 --> 00:23:49.357]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:24:06.002 --> 00:24:11.185]  Waging War on Corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:13.466 --> 00:24:28.195]  We have Bob Chapman, who's with Army Intelligence, a great economist and researcher, made a lot of stunning predictions to talk about the economy, the New World Order, impending terror attacks, in the next hour.
[00:24:29.873 --> 00:24:36.878]  Right now, let's go ahead and open the phones up, and then we'll continue with a lot of important news in the next segment.
[00:24:37.538 --> 00:24:40.020]  George in Canada, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:40.860]  Good day, Alex.
[00:24:41.161 --> 00:24:41.501]  Welcome.
[00:24:41.781 --> 00:24:50.467]  We're having an election up here in Canada, and I just want to make sure that a lot of your listeners who are listening north of the parallel understand that the leader of the Conservative Party, Mr. Harper,
[00:24:51.786 --> 00:24:55.749]  He was attending the Bilderberg Convention in Canada last year.
[00:24:55.769 --> 00:25:00.192]  It was in the Toronto Sun, May 15, 2003, so I'm sure it's gone down the memory hole.
[00:25:00.693 --> 00:25:09.499]  He attended with our then Prime Minister, Khrushchev, who shortly thereafter retired and offered his position to the incumbent, now Mr. Martin.
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.202]  And Mr. Harper was chosen as our new Prime Minister then.
[00:25:13.322 --> 00:25:19.567]  So Mr. Martin is to throw the election, and Mr. Harper is going to pick up all the loose change by exposing an old scandal.
[00:25:20.157 --> 00:25:24.298]  So don't be sucked into voting for this guy, because he's the pick of the New World Order.
[00:25:24.818 --> 00:25:30.179]  Vote for the most common down-to-earth neighbor you have, but don't waste your time or your money on this guy.
[00:25:30.199 --> 00:25:38.941]  Another interesting thing I came across in some research was a terrorist attack in the United States diverted back in the Nixon era.
[00:25:39.761 --> 00:25:45.422]  I was in a book called The Glasshouse Tapes by Lewis Tackwood, who was affiliated with the Los Angeles Police Department.
[00:25:45.882 --> 00:25:49.723]  They were going to have a Republican convention in Los Angeles.
[00:25:50.313 --> 00:26:03.242]  And he was an agent provocateur, he was supposed to hire a bunch of street thugs to fight the police, while at the same time, law enforcement agents working for the Nixon White House in an intelligence part of the LAPD were going to plant explosives
[00:26:03.792 --> 00:26:04.813]  In the convention hall.
[00:26:05.273 --> 00:26:07.495]  No, that's a famous case.
[00:26:07.555 --> 00:26:08.456]  That is confirmed.
[00:26:08.496 --> 00:26:10.457]  In fact, that's another example.
[00:26:10.477 --> 00:26:15.241]  I mean, there's so many examples of government-sponsored terrorism that I forgot about that one.
[00:26:15.581 --> 00:26:20.785]  Well, you're having two conventions coming down the trail, and why I think that's important is these guys aren't too small.
[00:26:20.825 --> 00:26:22.706]  Their handbook only has a couple of pages.
[00:26:22.726 --> 00:26:26.569]  Yeah, but tell folks how that last one got canceled.
[00:26:26.849 --> 00:26:32.934]  Because if good law enforcement inside the system blows the whistle on it, even covertly, the globalists will cancel it.
[00:26:33.394 --> 00:26:33.834]  Exactly.
[00:26:34.315 --> 00:26:46.961]  Well, with the Watergate break-ins and things starting to crumble around Mr. Nixon, this plot, and they were going to kill the delegates, and then that would give Nixon cause to declare a national emergency, become El Presidente for life.
[00:26:47.581 --> 00:26:55.005]  But one of the ringleaders of this, when the Republican Convention was moved to Miami, was a gentleman by the name of James McCord.
[00:26:55.045 --> 00:26:59.007]  He was the chief of security at that place, 19-year CIA veteran.
[00:26:59.665 --> 00:27:04.837]  And he was in charge of a 16-man unit that was concerned with planning and preparing for this process.
[00:27:05.459 --> 00:27:08.666]  And he got turned in, he was caught, he was arrested.
[00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:10.870]  The plot fell apart.
[00:27:12.311 --> 00:27:15.192]  And again, that's on the record, but we never hear about it.
[00:27:15.433 --> 00:27:16.833]  Well, it's gone down the memory hole.
[00:27:17.014 --> 00:27:17.494]  You know what?
[00:27:17.594 --> 00:27:21.957]  Years ago, I read some news articles about that, and I can't place them.
[00:27:21.997 --> 00:27:25.939]  Will you Xerox copy pages of your book, of that book, and mail them to me?
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:31.963]  Well, one place I have found it, I found it on the internet, conveniently, by researching the Kennedy assassination.
[00:27:32.303 --> 00:27:37.667]  This was published in 1972, as I recall, in an article by Martha Mitchell.
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.622]  And it was published in a magazine called The Realist.
[00:27:41.083 --> 00:27:48.010]  So if you search MarthaMitchell.com, you'll get this article, and there's also a very good one about the Kennedy assassination.
[00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:49.251]  Yeah, and I've seen that other places.
[00:27:49.311 --> 00:27:51.774]  I mean, I remember the whole attack getting foiled.
[00:27:51.814 --> 00:27:52.735]  It was minor news, but...
[00:27:53.388 --> 00:27:57.190]  That shows you how much of this stuff does go down the memory hole.
[00:27:57.611 --> 00:27:58.051]  Exactly.
[00:27:58.211 --> 00:27:59.552]  That's why history is so important.
[00:27:59.752 --> 00:28:00.352]  Hey, I hear you.
[00:28:00.392 --> 00:28:01.653]  Listen, I've got to let you go, my friend.
[00:28:01.673 --> 00:28:02.314]  Good to hear from you.
[00:28:02.854 --> 00:28:04.175]  I've got to give everybody time here.
[00:28:05.115 --> 00:28:07.517]  Let's talk to Andrea in Ohio.
[00:28:07.557 --> 00:28:08.037]  Go ahead.
[00:28:08.557 --> 00:28:09.598]  Good afternoon, sir.
[00:28:09.858 --> 00:28:10.178]  Welcome.
[00:28:10.459 --> 00:28:18.424]  Another place you may be able to find that information, it's been years since I've read it, but there's a Jonathan Stockwell book called The Secret Wars of the CIA.
[00:28:19.757 --> 00:28:20.677]  I'm familiar with it.
[00:28:20.917 --> 00:28:21.897]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:22.658 --> 00:28:29.739]  But about this torture thing, are there any Christian or faith groups out there who are opposing this?
[00:28:29.819 --> 00:28:45.322]  Because my experience has been, over the last couple of weeks, especially in conservative Christian circles, this mindset of, well, they do worse things to us, so, you know, it's almost a
[00:28:46.115 --> 00:28:50.997]  I've had people on the show that say, yeah, torture is good, and I wonder how those individuals out there feel
[00:29:05.643 --> 00:29:15.268]  And, you know, all the pundits that have been on television out there promoting torture, now that all these horrible images come back and we learn of the rape of women, beating people to death.
[00:29:15.328 --> 00:29:21.731]  I mean, how can... and I've heard the so-called Christians snickering on talk radio about it.
[00:29:21.751 --> 00:29:22.471]  It's very funny.
[00:29:23.372 --> 00:29:25.753]  It would be funny if it weren't so frightening.
[00:29:26.409 --> 00:29:34.792]  And the thing is, too, if you compare how this propaganda works, I'll never forget reading a Robert J. Liston book, The Nazi Doctors.
[00:29:34.972 --> 00:29:36.612]  I tell you what, stay there, I'm gonna let you finish up.
[00:29:38.393 --> 00:29:39.373]  It's sick, people!
[00:29:39.773 --> 00:29:41.494]  I mean, torture is not good!
[00:29:41.514 --> 00:29:44.595]  I mean, do I have to go over this?
[00:29:44.675 --> 00:29:46.655]  I mean, what happened to us?
[00:29:47.456 --> 00:29:48.476]  Stay there, we'll be right back.
[00:29:51.497 --> 00:29:52.417]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.877 --> 00:29:54.398]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.413 --> 00:29:58.174]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.095 --> 00:30:05.175]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[00:30:05.395 --> 00:30:08.436]  Don't underestimate the urgency of the need to become self-sufficient.
[00:30:08.576 --> 00:30:14.638]  In our kit, we're sending you 25 pounds of organic red winter wheat and that's nearly a year of high-potency wheatgrass juice.
[00:30:14.878 --> 00:30:20.079]  The book, Wheatgrass Nature's Finest Medicine and our beautiful stainless steel wheatgrass juicer.
[00:30:20.299 --> 00:30:32.357]  But most importantly, we are professional wheatgrass growers and I am going to be your contact to walk you through the process of successfully growing your continuing self-supply of full-scale nutrition from pennies worth of grain.
[00:30:32.477 --> 00:30:33.338]  So call 1-877-MY-WHEAT
[00:30:35.701 --> 00:30:38.143]  Or, go to austinwheatgrass.com.
[00:30:38.383 --> 00:30:44.286]  Growing your own wheatgrass is not as easy as some would have you think, and we've learned this the hard way through five years of growing experience.
[00:30:44.446 --> 00:30:46.447]  And we're going to pass on to you our knowledge.
[00:30:46.567 --> 00:30:47.968]  Don't settle for anything less.
[00:30:48.188 --> 00:30:49.729]  Call me and get the real details.
[00:30:49.749 --> 00:30:49.989]  1-877-MY-WHEAT.
[00:30:50.109 --> 00:30:50.530]  That's 1-877-699-4328.
[00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:55.012]  And as always, we thank you for your support of our labors and of this network.
[00:31:01.095 --> 00:31:03.076]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[00:31:03.156 --> 00:31:13.882]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.243 --> 00:31:18.765]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:18.845 --> 00:31:30.172]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:30.772 --> 00:31:37.621]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:38.021 --> 00:31:40.144]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:31:40.645 --> 00:31:45.611]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[00:31:45.911 --> 00:31:52.220]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:56.486]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:31:56.706 --> 00:31:57.467]  That's toll free.
[00:31:57.487 --> 00:31:57.527]  888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.472 --> 00:32:05.434]  Are you concerned about the quality of air and purity of water in your household?
[00:32:05.894 --> 00:32:12.937]  If you answered yes, then you owe it to yourself and your family to check out the amazing benefits of owning your own personal ozone generator.
[00:32:13.317 --> 00:32:17.438]  With an ozone generator, you can kill bacteria and viruses in your drinking water.
[00:32:17.939 --> 00:32:21.180]  Get rid of that stale air in your house that keeps recirculating.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:26.421]  Your new ozone generator will remove odors and provide a clean, fresh scent throughout your house.
[00:32:26.901 --> 00:32:31.562]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises for one of the most affordable ozone generators available today.
[00:32:31.983 --> 00:32:34.783]  That number is 800-569-4340.
[00:32:35.203 --> 00:32:44.306]  The ozone generator is portable, has an internal blower for ozone disbursement into the air, and comes with a tube attachment for ozonating liquids.
[00:32:44.706 --> 00:32:46.066]  Best of all, it's affordable.
[00:32:46.426 --> 00:32:47.766]  It's only $385 and that includes the shipping.
[00:32:50.447 --> 00:33:16.553]  So call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340 for your personal ozone generator or visit on the web at cliffscott.com Alright my friends, we're continuing with your phone calls.
[00:33:16.613 --> 00:33:19.714]  We've got a former military intelligence officer
[00:33:21.102 --> 00:33:27.285]  A economist, expert on the New World Order, Bob Chapman, International Forecaster, joining us in the next hour.
[00:33:29.565 --> 00:33:32.527]  Let's go ahead and go back to Andrea in Ohio.
[00:33:32.627 --> 00:33:37.368]  She was talking about how it's supposedly Christian now.
[00:33:38.609 --> 00:33:48.713]  According to some people, they make excuses for it and say, oh well, raping and killing and beating people to death, you know, we've got to get tough on the war on terror, we've got to do it to those evil Muslims.
[00:33:50.499 --> 00:33:55.846]  So, according to that worldview, I've said this before, I guess Joseph Mingala was okay.
[00:33:56.446 --> 00:34:01.833]  I don't think that the Nazi torture master was good, but maybe that's because I'm a devil worshipper.
[00:34:02.193 --> 00:34:06.018]  Well, I mean, you know, because now to be Christian, you've got to love Molech.
[00:34:06.624 --> 00:34:08.044]  You've got to love George Bush.
[00:34:08.084 --> 00:34:11.105]  You've got to love the police state.
[00:34:11.165 --> 00:34:12.665]  You've got to love the New World Order.
[00:34:13.026 --> 00:34:15.366]  And if you're against torture, why, that's quite devilish.
[00:34:15.406 --> 00:34:16.466]  It's like Nancy Reagan.
[00:34:16.486 --> 00:34:19.827]  We need the body parts of the children, the stem cell research.
[00:34:20.707 --> 00:34:23.708]  And I have confirmed now, some of the neocons are out saying, yes, yes, yes.
[00:34:23.748 --> 00:34:27.649]  So now if you're not for using body parts of children, you're a wicked devil.
[00:34:28.249 --> 00:34:28.989]  But go ahead.
[00:34:29.169 --> 00:34:29.409]  Sure.
[00:34:29.709 --> 00:34:36.251]  Now, it has some really interesting historical parallels, because you see what the Nazi doctors did
[00:34:37.014 --> 00:34:39.735]  They did a similar type of thing, you see, Alex.
[00:34:39.795 --> 00:34:53.498]  They used the war as a pretext to start the euthanasia program, which first began on German citizens who were mentally ill or physically handicapped.
[00:34:53.538 --> 00:34:55.758]  They could be blind or crippled or whatever.
[00:34:56.259 --> 00:35:06.561]  And so what they did was they conditioned the public, much in the same way as we're being conditioned, with these films, such as the one I accused, that was a famous
[00:35:07.139 --> 00:35:13.483]  Nazi euthanasia film in which it was portrayed in a sympathetic light.
[00:35:13.643 --> 00:35:24.851]  There were also training films for doctors teaching them, you know, basically showing mentally ill patients in a disgusting light.
[00:35:25.952 --> 00:35:32.956]  And the reason I'm saying all that is that propaganda, whether the Nazis used it or we used it,
[00:35:33.985 --> 00:35:35.766]  It operates much the same way.
[00:35:35.826 --> 00:35:42.512]  I mean, other callers have said this, they build a straw man only so that he can be knocked down again.
[00:35:42.812 --> 00:35:46.074]  And they create a quote-unquote ethical quandary.
[00:35:46.495 --> 00:35:53.960]  Of course, the reality is nothing like the scenarios they create in these shows like Threat Matrix and 24.
[00:35:55.603 --> 00:35:56.844]  Yeah, there's a nuclear bomb.
[00:35:56.864 --> 00:35:58.745]  They gotta have the answers.
[00:35:58.905 --> 00:36:04.209]  And the loving control officer straps him down and cries and says, I don't want to torture you.
[00:36:04.249 --> 00:36:06.230]  And the bad person goes, ah, go ahead.
[00:36:07.812 --> 00:36:11.514]  Because they're inhuman and they go ahead and zap them in blood sprays.
[00:36:11.714 --> 00:36:13.155]  But they save everybody.
[00:36:13.255 --> 00:36:14.536]  Torture's really good.
[00:36:15.837 --> 00:36:20.080]  The reality is what it was in Latin America.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:24.503]  I can remember reading the old Amnesty International and America's Watch reports.
[00:36:24.543 --> 00:36:32.489]  Yeah, they'd just pull a family over in their little truck, walk them out, put a bullet in daddy, mommy's head, line the toddlers up, mow them down.
[00:36:32.789 --> 00:36:33.030]  Sure.
[00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:34.811]  Or take them in a pit.
[00:36:34.991 --> 00:36:37.693]  Yeah, and torture them for their training.
[00:36:37.713 --> 00:36:39.214]  You know, they're training people to do this.
[00:36:39.234 --> 00:36:42.196]  So they would grab somebody off the street and
[00:36:45.177 --> 00:36:46.998]  Well, ma'am, you've certainly done your homework.
[00:36:47.179 --> 00:37:03.730]  I've actually seen documentaries and read a lot about what the Nazis did, but actually they learned all this from American and British eugenics experts, Margaret Sanger and others, and in the Nuremberg trials, they actually tried to use the Margaret Sanger doctrine as their defense.
[00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:12.656]  Again, the head of Planned Parenthood, the founder of it, and just chilling stuff, and it did start on the retarded children, people who were handicapped,
[00:37:13.371 --> 00:37:19.656]  And they built the cadre out of that, and now we call it bioethics today, and it's being promoted.
[00:37:20.617 --> 00:37:22.779]  And again, it's not just conservatives that are out fighting it.
[00:37:22.819 --> 00:37:28.123]  Wesley Smith, who's a Democrat, writes for the Wall Street Journal.
[00:37:28.163 --> 00:37:35.889]  He's done dozens of reports listing the names of people who are paralyzed, neck down, begging for food and water.
[00:37:36.409 --> 00:37:44.511]  But because they signed over control of their life to the state, the state says, oh, you didn't want any aid, and they're begging, asking, man, please have water, food.
[00:37:44.531 --> 00:37:47.232]  I mean, he's listed the names, and they're killing people.
[00:37:47.472 --> 00:37:54.174]  How many Americans, I guess who don't read the Wall Street Journal, know that they're killing people begging for food and water?
[00:37:55.255 --> 00:38:00.096]  I think what has happened, if we've entered what I've heard called a culture of complacency,
[00:38:00.883 --> 00:38:04.664]  And we either don't care... Well, Wesley Smith calls it a culture of death.
[00:38:04.824 --> 00:38:06.325]  Yeah, it is a culture of death.
[00:38:06.705 --> 00:38:17.628]  And we either don't care, or in the Christian world, there's this mindset that says, oh, well, prophecy's got to be fulfilled, so we can't do anything about it anyway.
[00:38:18.788 --> 00:38:22.449]  Or they're just so preoccupied with their own little lives.
[00:38:22.529 --> 00:38:24.170]  I mean, I think it struck me the other night.
[00:38:25.407 --> 00:38:35.014]  Just, you know, I mean, everybody's just going out to a restaurant, doing what they normally do, and, I mean, it's what Hannah Arendt calls the banality of evil.
[00:38:37.315 --> 00:38:39.096]  I hear you, and I appreciate the call.
[00:38:39.136 --> 00:38:40.057]  Good to hear from you.
[00:38:40.117 --> 00:38:40.637]  Good call.
[00:38:40.717 --> 00:38:41.018]  Wow.
[00:38:41.758 --> 00:38:43.279]  Carlos in California.
[00:38:43.319 --> 00:38:44.280]  Carlos, go ahead.
[00:38:45.821 --> 00:38:46.081]  Hello?
[00:38:46.702 --> 00:38:47.042]  Yes, sir.
[00:38:48.103 --> 00:38:49.944]  Yes, uh, Carlos here.
[00:38:50.384 --> 00:38:50.704]  Yes, sir.
[00:38:51.625 --> 00:38:54.507]  Yeah, Alex, uh, so this, uh,
[00:38:55.382 --> 00:39:19.896]  It's uh... commissions that are appointed are nothing but uh... washovers to camouflage the truth and counterfeit truth uh... you know during the uh... the warren commission and we go back through history uh... was there to whitewash and uh... obscure the truth about the kennedy assassinations and of course the new world order appointed some other people to it to uh... such as uh... Ford and uh...
[00:39:21.249 --> 00:39:25.130]  Next President Ford, and of course they rewarded him.
[00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:27.011]  And Earl Warren himself!
[00:39:28.992 --> 00:39:29.512]  Exactly!
[00:39:29.592 --> 00:39:30.292]  Well of course!
[00:39:31.212 --> 00:39:35.794]  And then the 9-11 Commission, you've got some very questionable characters there.
[00:39:36.174 --> 00:39:50.239]  You've got a Mr. Keene, who owned some of the stocks in some of the military industrial corporations that are reaping profits from the
[00:39:51.307 --> 00:39:54.169]  Okay, let me just say something here, Carlos.
[00:39:54.269 --> 00:39:54.790]  Number one,
[00:40:19.406 --> 00:40:21.507]  Who appointed the 9-11 Commission?
[00:40:21.687 --> 00:40:22.948]  George W. Bush.
[00:40:23.788 --> 00:40:25.229]  That shows it's not independent.
[00:40:25.269 --> 00:40:32.472]  It's like they appoint the new Iraqi government, and then go, oh look, we've given them freedom, our appointees want us to stay.
[00:40:32.492 --> 00:40:44.458]  I mean, this is so bald-faced, in-your-face, that it's staggering, just the wall of just obvious lies, and Chairman Keene
[00:40:45.296 --> 00:40:48.438]  He's in business with one of Bin Laden's brothers-in-law.
[00:40:48.698 --> 00:40:50.559]  He's in a bunch of different businesses with Bush.
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:57.463]  The head staffer on it helped write Connelisa Rice's book for a bunch of the other members.
[00:40:58.083 --> 00:41:01.505]  The Democrat who quit a few months ago got the head of the import-export bank.
[00:41:01.605 --> 00:41:03.766]  Bush gave him that chairmanship.
[00:41:04.087 --> 00:41:04.847]  It's a joke!
[00:41:06.048 --> 00:41:13.372]  Again, it's like we've got Ashcroft investigating Rumsfeld
[00:41:14.364 --> 00:41:17.725]  For torture, and then Rumsfeld's running the investigation over himself.
[00:41:18.445 --> 00:41:24.867]  I mean, do we have to explain that the criminals aren't supposed to be the prosecutors in their own trials?
[00:41:25.588 --> 00:41:35.691]  Well, you know, the sad thing is that most Americans are so gullible that they don't see through the obvious things that other Americans that do a little bit of research do.
[00:41:36.611 --> 00:41:42.073]  You know, Americans don't care, basically, and that's why they're the most ignorant people on the Earth.
[00:41:43.444 --> 00:41:58.635]  And that said, this being the greatest economic power, the greatest democratic power, we have people that are so gullible and naive, and our nation is falling apart because of our lack of knowledge.
[00:41:58.815 --> 00:42:02.018]  Well, you're right, Carlos, but Carlos, that's the cycle.
[00:42:02.678 --> 00:42:08.062]  In every major civilization, they're strong to begin with, intelligent, informed,
[00:42:09.111 --> 00:42:22.913]  Then, because they're free, they become wealthy, you have plenty, and then their children become spoiled brats, their children become thugs, their children become killers, and then you've got tyranny.
[00:42:23.654 --> 00:42:28.814]  And it happens over and over and over again, and so we're decadent, and you're right.
[00:42:29.275 --> 00:42:37.596]  Just 50 years ago, Americans were the smartest people in the world, the highest test scores, the most educated.
[00:42:38.445 --> 00:42:46.370]  Okay, now we are behind all industrialized countries and 20 plus third world countries.
[00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:54.315]  We're way down the list now for the level of education and being informed.
[00:42:54.955 --> 00:43:00.078]  They have major polls every year of high school seniors and one year it's 75%, one year 89%.
[00:43:01.119 --> 00:43:02.820]  Don't know who the Vice President is.
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.261]  Don't know how many continents there are.
[00:43:05.922 --> 00:43:07.843]  Don't know what the First Amendment is.
[00:43:08.423 --> 00:43:10.724]  Uh, don't know the three branches of government.
[00:43:11.125 --> 00:43:13.526]  Uh, can't name five state capitals.
[00:43:13.946 --> 00:43:19.969]  Sir, they don't know anything, but they'll tell you their opinion about torture, Carlos!
[00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:23.351]  Well, it's so sad, you know.
[00:43:23.371 --> 00:43:28.853]  There's a deliberate dumbing down of the people, which of course is controlled by the New World Order.
[00:43:29.674 --> 00:43:31.675]  They control the educational system.
[00:43:32.215 --> 00:43:37.658]  They impose collective philosophies, and they
[00:43:38.345 --> 00:43:42.248]  They downgrade and debunk any individual achievement.
[00:43:42.828 --> 00:43:48.752]  It's all supposed to be a collective achievement by the student.
[00:43:48.792 --> 00:43:50.193]  And again, you're right.
[00:43:50.333 --> 00:43:56.817]  That is not... You have some wonderful communist society that they've promised us, which of course is a fraud.
[00:43:57.317 --> 00:44:00.620]  It's so the elite doesn't have any competition for their total domination.
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:01.160]  Thanks for the call.
[00:44:02.203 --> 00:44:03.024]  Another great caller.
[00:44:03.664 --> 00:44:05.605]  Ken in California, go ahead Ken.
[00:44:06.286 --> 00:44:15.352]  Yes, John Ashcroft stated two days ago in that investigation that we're not covered by the Geneva Convention because our so-called enemies
[00:44:16.238 --> 00:44:17.458]  Are not wearing uniforms.
[00:44:17.498 --> 00:44:18.719]  They don't come from a state.
[00:44:18.879 --> 00:44:21.479]  Let me stop you, Ken, because a lot of people don't know what you're talking about.
[00:44:21.499 --> 00:44:24.180]  You're making another incredible, just incredible call after incredible call.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:33.743]  Ashcroft, before Congress, testified about the torture, said he won't release all the memos where they say Bush is God and is allowed to torture and is above all federal laws.
[00:44:33.783 --> 00:44:35.263]  We did get those pieces of the memo, but
[00:44:35.703 --> 00:44:40.325]  He's refusing to release or investigate it, and yes, I didn't see it, but I read the transcript.
[00:44:41.005 --> 00:44:50.469]  Then with Doublethink, oh, we're not torturing, we're not going to give you the information, but at the same time, oh, but we're allowed to, because we're not under the Geneva Convention, because these are enemy combatants.
[00:44:50.509 --> 00:44:50.850]  Go ahead.
[00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:54.211]  I have never heard such doublespeak in my life.
[00:44:54.451 --> 00:44:59.873]  I mean, it was... I mean, I saw the whole thing, and it was just... It was absolutely astounding.
[00:45:00.514 --> 00:45:03.275]  He kept repeating, the President has not ordered anything that...
[00:45:04.099 --> 00:45:04.881]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:45:12.748 --> 00:45:13.808]  The Geneva Convention.
[00:45:13.868 --> 00:45:15.529]  He really would not answer the question.
[00:45:15.709 --> 00:45:20.970]  It's obvious that these memos going back and forth, he gave the advice, and torture is okay.
[00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:34.294]  Well, General Antonio Tagumas' report of, what, five weeks ago, has the admissions, the confessions, he saw the thousands of photographs and videos, they admit raping women.
[00:45:35.225 --> 00:45:37.106]  Beating people to death.
[00:45:37.727 --> 00:45:39.828]  Beating children in front of their parents.
[00:45:40.008 --> 00:45:43.411]  Reuters, uh, cameramen have had their children tortured in front of them.
[00:45:43.431 --> 00:45:44.211]  That's been in Reuters.
[00:45:44.711 --> 00:45:45.992]  It's all in the report.
[00:45:46.052 --> 00:45:54.638]  Then the other Army report says 70 to 90 percent of those in the 32 camps were arrested at checkpoints for not having papers in order.
[00:45:54.658 --> 00:45:58.320]  And they've almost all got children with them.
[00:45:59.081 --> 00:46:01.102]  And I mean, look, who would go take a job?
[00:46:01.883 --> 00:46:04.925]  They admit they went to prisons, this has now come out, that had
[00:46:06.035 --> 00:46:07.956]  Bad records that were being investigated.
[00:46:08.337 --> 00:46:15.941]  Ashcroft, a year ago, a year plus ago, sent feds in to give people bonuses to join the military.
[00:46:16.422 --> 00:46:18.083]  Prison guards with bad records.
[00:46:18.683 --> 00:46:20.244]  They did this on purpose.
[00:46:20.264 --> 00:46:20.664]  Go ahead.
[00:46:21.385 --> 00:46:23.146]  I think we need an independent prosecutor.
[00:46:23.486 --> 00:46:31.211]  But how are we going to get an independent prosecutor when the Republicans who support the President, which are the majority in Congress,
[00:46:31.556 --> 00:46:33.417]  Have to appoint the independent prosecutor.
[00:46:33.437 --> 00:46:34.437]  What are we supposed to do?
[00:46:34.638 --> 00:46:40.060]  But again, you didn't see Bill Clinton shutting down School of America in Georgia, the tortured university.
[00:46:40.821 --> 00:46:43.442]  You don't see the Democrats calling for real investigations.
[00:46:43.862 --> 00:46:45.663]  So again, you say the Republicans.
[00:46:45.723 --> 00:46:50.285]  Again, you have to know, sir, that Bush and Kerry and all of this, it's a staged event.
[00:46:50.325 --> 00:46:50.825]  It's theater.
[00:46:51.306 --> 00:46:51.826]  Yes, I know.
[00:46:52.326 --> 00:46:52.926]  I do agree with you.
[00:46:53.167 --> 00:47:00.070]  But don't you think that if we put enough pressure on the Congress, that they'll finally have to appoint some kind of independent counsel to investigate this thing?
[00:47:00.618 --> 00:47:04.279]  Yeah, but, I mean, they called this, the 9-11 Commission, independent when Bush appointed it.
[00:47:04.459 --> 00:47:08.221]  They called Danforth, appointed by Reno, over the Waco investigation, independent.
[00:47:08.381 --> 00:47:14.663]  They're calling Rumsfeld, running the torture investigation, independent, when the memos are out there, when he gave the order.
[00:47:14.803 --> 00:47:17.284]  So... Is it under federal law?
[00:47:17.584 --> 00:47:18.264]  I understand.
[00:47:18.744 --> 00:47:23.688]  And that's why the memo before all this torture from the Defense Department by Rumsfeld says we're above the law.
[00:47:23.708 --> 00:47:25.490]  The President is not bound by federal law.
[00:47:38.997 --> 00:47:48.239]  So I guess that means he can, you know, snort cocaine on the White House lawn or, or, or, or, you know, he's not bound by law, they're saying.
[00:47:48.259 --> 00:47:48.880]  Thanks for the call.
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:49.300]  Thank you.
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:51.260]  And of course they are bound by law.
[00:47:54.141 --> 00:48:05.804]  I mean, when the government starts saying we're not bound by our own laws, folks, we know they've been ignoring their own laws forever and selectively enforcing them, but heaven help us when they start publicly saying we're not bound by laws.
[00:48:06.952 --> 00:48:08.954]  I mean, that is Stalin-esque.
[00:48:09.234 --> 00:48:10.395]  That is Hitlerian.
[00:48:11.016 --> 00:48:13.559]  That is Mao Zedong-ish.
[00:48:13.699 --> 00:48:15.540]  That is Fidel-ish.
[00:48:17.723 --> 00:48:19.424]  Again, I'm speechless at this point.
[00:48:19.885 --> 00:48:21.867]  We'll come back and continue with calls.
[00:48:21.887 --> 00:48:25.871]  We've got an amazing guest in the second hour, Bob Chapman, coming up.
[00:48:26.751 --> 00:48:30.895]  And we'll come back and go to Winston, and then we'll talk to
[00:48:32.319 --> 00:48:34.180]  Mark and Kevin and many, many others.
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:37.382]  Total free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:48:38.283 --> 00:48:52.892]  Before I end this segment, though, I want to spend the next minute and a half beseeching all of you, imploring you, prostrating myself before you to take action and to get my videos.
[00:48:52.952 --> 00:48:56.094]  I've made ten films, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror.
[00:48:56.434 --> 00:48:58.135]  Both those films cover September 11th.
[00:48:58.155 --> 00:48:59.476]  They're both over two hours long.
[00:49:00.094 --> 00:49:01.975]  They will expose who the terrorists are.
[00:49:02.415 --> 00:49:05.096]  It is so important to get these videos and to make copies of them.
[00:49:05.276 --> 00:49:08.918]  If you already have them and were impressed with them, please make copies of what you got.
[00:49:09.418 --> 00:49:11.459]  We also need your support, quite frankly.
[00:49:12.299 --> 00:49:13.760]  I need to, you know, pay my staff.
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:15.281]  I need to actually hire some more people.
[00:49:15.341 --> 00:49:17.942]  I've been working 18-hour days again and it's wearing on me.
[00:49:18.722 --> 00:49:20.963]  But number one, these are powerful videos.
[00:49:21.343 --> 00:49:22.704]  You need to have them.
[00:49:24.133 --> 00:49:26.215]  You need to have these films, folks.
[00:49:26.856 --> 00:49:28.137]  These are preeminent films.
[00:49:28.177 --> 00:49:29.358]  They're well done.

[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:08.827]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:52:09.107 --> 00:52:13.831]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:52:14.072 --> 00:52:19.717]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:52:19.957 --> 00:52:24.480]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:31.845]  The cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:52:31.865 --> 00:52:36.408]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:52:36.568 --> 00:52:39.090]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:52:39.310 --> 00:52:46.015]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[00:53:20.829 --> 00:53:25.170]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.

[00:53:54.755 --> 00:54:10.388]  You know, the good news is that we're still able to get up on the radio on AM and FM stations across the country, from Kansas City to Pensacola, Florida, from Rhode Island to Los Angeles, California, from Austin, Texas to
[00:54:22.341 --> 00:54:25.464]  You know, Denver, Colorado, and to tell the truth.
[00:54:26.344 --> 00:54:28.666]  And that it's not part of this phony left-right paradigm.
[00:54:29.447 --> 00:54:30.948]  And the best news I can give you is this.
[00:54:31.849 --> 00:54:35.031]  I have talked on the streets to thousands of people.
[00:54:35.892 --> 00:54:40.335]  I have done, now it's over 1,600 radio interviews in the last two and a half years.
[00:54:41.176 --> 00:54:43.718]  And maybe one call out of 30 calls in and disagrees.
[00:54:43.818 --> 00:54:45.440]  Liberal shows, conservative shows.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:47.141]  People are waking up.
[00:54:48.090 --> 00:54:54.973]  I've talked to a lot of Hollywood people that are getting past the phony left-right system and waking up to the New World Order.
[00:54:55.873 --> 00:54:58.014]  I mean, very divergent groups.
[00:54:59.815 --> 00:55:03.017]  So much is happening.
[00:55:03.057 --> 00:55:06.058]  I'm consulting for two British TV documentaries.
[00:55:07.739 --> 00:55:13.081]  I'm consulting on two films, major motion pictures.
[00:55:14.512 --> 00:55:19.274]  I am, you know, writing forwards for books, and it's so diverse.
[00:55:19.674 --> 00:55:21.634]  There is such an awakening taking place.
[00:55:22.134 --> 00:55:29.496]  Got a call yesterday, I haven't seen it yet, but the new Running Man release, 2004 DVD, supposedly has a 20-minute special, saying, look at the Running Man!
[00:55:29.516 --> 00:55:31.097]  This is all really happening in America!
[00:55:31.137 --> 00:55:31.737]  It's horrible!
[00:55:31.817 --> 00:55:32.277]  Stop it!
[00:55:32.637 --> 00:55:33.477]  We're the producers!
[00:55:33.517 --> 00:55:34.178]  We're upset!
[00:55:35.078 --> 00:55:39.299]  And so, you know, folks, a lot of stuff is happening right now.
[00:55:40.219 --> 00:55:42.480]  And my only
[00:55:43.875 --> 00:55:47.437]  My only regret is I can't do more for my country and my family.
[00:55:47.678 --> 00:55:50.980]  That sounds corny, but literally, I can't do more in this fight.
[00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:51.680]  I wish I could.
[00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:52.881]  I'm trying to work smarter.
[00:55:53.882 --> 00:55:55.103]  But you can take action.
[00:55:55.163 --> 00:55:55.963]  You can do more.
[00:55:56.043 --> 00:55:58.945]  You can become incredible leaders in this fight.
[00:55:59.005 --> 00:55:59.986]  You have power.
[00:56:01.527 --> 00:56:05.770]  Let's go ahead and take more calls.
[00:56:05.890 --> 00:56:07.030]  Winston in Alabama.
[00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:07.911]  Winston, go ahead.
[00:56:08.471 --> 00:56:09.072]  Okay, Alex.
[00:56:09.152 --> 00:56:10.293]  I've got three quick points.
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:26.291]  Also, there's a little clip on the end of the Matrix that's similar to that, where the producer's just talking about it, and he talks about how there is a secret behind the secret, and it's on the end of the Matrix.
[00:56:26.332 --> 00:56:27.733]  But at any rate, that's not what I called it.
[00:56:27.953 --> 00:56:29.114]  Which Matrix is that?
[00:56:29.134 --> 00:56:30.635]  I think it's the first one.
[00:56:32.196 --> 00:56:34.178]  Are you saying it's something extra on the DVD?
[00:56:34.818 --> 00:56:35.358]  DVD, right.
[00:56:35.378 --> 00:56:35.759]  Uh-huh.
[00:56:36.079 --> 00:56:36.519]  Wow!
[00:56:38.081 --> 00:56:39.402]  So, they're around.
[00:56:39.442 --> 00:56:41.263]  A lot of those DVDs have extra stuff.
[00:56:42.210 --> 00:56:49.695]  Also, though, a few years ago, I picked up this CD in a record shop called, uh, the Movie Minority Report.
[00:56:49.735 --> 00:56:50.915]  I'm sure you're familiar with that.
[00:56:51.375 --> 00:56:51.736]  Yes!
[00:56:52.456 --> 00:57:01.201]  And, uh, I just had been listening to you for a while, and it amazes me at how saturated we are with this new way of thinking.
[00:57:01.741 --> 00:57:08.145]  For instance, this CD is free, and I just picked it up, you know, to see what it was, put it on my computer, and it's a game!
[00:57:08.621 --> 00:57:11.583]  And the name of the game is Welcome to the Department of Pre-Crime.
[00:57:12.364 --> 00:57:16.867]  And you have a case you have to find and identify the perpetrator of the pre-crime.
[00:57:16.927 --> 00:57:23.951]  Yeah, that's a Philip K. Dick book and um... and uh... Spielberg is definitely on the other side.
[00:57:23.992 --> 00:57:29.855]  He goes to Bilderberg Group meetings uh... and they basically took that film and it's a big conditioning mechanism.
[00:57:30.336 --> 00:57:32.557]  Well this is a little game that you play on your TV.
[00:57:32.617 --> 00:57:35.980]  Yeah, I know they had a game with it and the fake TV ads and the rest of it.
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:37.861]  Alright, the other thing I wanted to mention
[00:57:38.362 --> 00:57:42.883]  Well, there was another movie called The Trial by Orson Welles, 1963.
[00:57:42.983 --> 00:57:55.866]  It was just another movie I picked up, and it basically is about how, and it's basically what's going on now, where they have a guy's convicted, uh, arrested, but nobody will tell him what he's arrested for.
[00:57:56.406 --> 00:58:00.407]  And everybody just says, you know what, you know what to do.
[00:58:00.427 --> 00:58:05.428]  And that's what Homeland Security does, and they're setting that precedent for all citizens for all crimes.
[00:58:06.152 --> 00:58:12.057]  And this was back in 1963, so... By the way, if you want to say hi to the star of the Matrix, you can say hi to him right now.
[00:58:12.858 --> 00:58:13.918]  I'm gonna shut up.
[00:58:14.579 --> 00:58:16.741]  Hey, listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:58:17.602 --> 00:58:20.464]  It's good to hear from you.
[00:58:20.524 --> 00:58:22.826]  I'm glad I brought up movies and the next caller brought them up.
[00:58:23.606 --> 00:58:24.327]  Good to hear from you.
[00:58:24.767 --> 00:58:29.351]  Alright, the second hour is straight ahead.
[00:58:31.413 --> 00:58:34.956]  And we will break and come back.
[00:58:36.397 --> 00:58:38.639]  And take your calls, and we also have Bob Chapman coming on.
[00:58:38.679 --> 00:58:41.441]  But no, we have a lot of listeners to this show that are interesting people.
[00:58:41.722 --> 00:58:43.063]  You want to say hi to them and thank them for listening?
[00:58:44.104 --> 00:58:44.524]  All right.
[00:58:45.405 --> 00:58:45.905]  Enough said.
[00:58:46.766 --> 00:58:47.747]  Second hour, straight ahead.

[00:59:59.576 --> 01:00:00.616]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:01.336 --> 01:00:02.457]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:03.097 --> 01:00:03.918]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.678 --> 01:00:05.578]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:06.239 --> 01:00:09.981]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.421 --> 01:00:14.483]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.188 --> 01:00:36.013]  Alright my friends, we're now into our number two of this live Thursday edition.
[01:00:36.073 --> 01:00:45.079]  We have John Ashcroft and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld investigating themselves and the torture scandal.
[01:00:46.407 --> 01:00:57.993]  We have a lot of Big Brother activities going on, more troops, our troops being killed in Afghanistan and Iraq, a bunch of economic news, and of course, I know we've got loaded phone lines, but we're going to your calls early in this hour.
[01:00:58.973 --> 01:01:07.758]  And Bob Chapman was in military intelligence, he's a highly respected economist, written for a lot of big journals in the country.
[01:01:08.744 --> 01:01:22.610]  And he's made incredible prediction after amazing prediction here on this show of the years and on other broadcasts and in print in his International Forecaster, one of the most highly respected periodicals out there.
[01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:25.271]  And we're going to have Bob Chapman with us.
[01:01:25.451 --> 01:01:27.032]  And Bob, good to have you on the show with us.
[01:01:29.213 --> 01:01:30.073]  Do we have Bob there?
[01:01:31.994 --> 01:01:33.315]  Hey, Bob, good to have you on with us.
[01:01:35.756 --> 01:01:39.178]  Bob, tell us a little bit about yourself in a nutshell for those who don't know who you are.
[01:01:39.198 --> 01:01:48.222]  Then I want to get into the whole geopolitical scene, the economy, the war, the impending terror attacks that Bush is out fear-mongering us through as surrogates.
[01:01:49.903 --> 01:01:54.505]  Well, as you said, I worked in counterintelligence for the government.
[01:01:54.645 --> 01:01:55.766]  I went to university.
[01:01:55.786 --> 01:02:02.049]  I was probably one of the largest, if not the largest, gold-silver stockbroker
[01:02:02.585 --> 01:02:05.866]  I've been in the world for 28 years, own my own brokerage firm.
[01:02:06.867 --> 01:02:13.030]  I retired in 1989 and couldn't stand it, so I continued to write.
[01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:24.174]  I had written for several journals, plus my own clientele of 6,000 clients, and so I just carried it on with the International Forecaster.
[01:02:25.055 --> 01:02:32.078]  I also had another publication before that called the Gary Allen Report, which Gary Allen and I wrote together.
[01:02:34.585 --> 01:02:49.475]  Now, I know you've got a lot on your mind today, and I've got questions I've got for you, and I know the listeners will as well, so we can talk about basically any issue, but the economy right now, they're telling us that it's doing wonderfully, but then I look at all the real economic numbers, and they're in the toilet.
[01:02:49.755 --> 01:02:53.097]  What's the reality from your 30-plus years of study?
[01:02:54.458 --> 01:03:02.504]  Well, I think the overall reality is the government is lying about most every figure that they released.
[01:03:03.385 --> 01:03:11.130]  Now, whether that would happen under a different administration remains to be seen, because of the power behind the government itself.
[01:03:11.971 --> 01:03:23.958]  But the American public is not being told the truth, and that's why people subscribe to the International Forecaster, hoping that they can get more of the truth as to what is really going on.
[01:03:24.519 --> 01:03:26.580]  And so, yes, it is as bad as it seems.
[01:03:27.529 --> 01:03:30.872]  Particularly in this unemployment situation, which they've tried to improve.
[01:03:32.173 --> 01:03:48.846]  To make a long story short, most of it is deception, and employment has only improved ever so slightly, in spite of the billions and billions of dollars that have been poured into the economy.
[01:03:49.486 --> 01:03:56.632]  And so I think the situation is now that the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan,
[01:03:57.176 --> 01:04:05.120]  Has got to increase in liquidity at an ever-increasing rate just to keep the economy's nose above water.
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:09.562]  And I think he's got some serious problems with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
[01:04:10.442 --> 01:04:17.286]  And I think that's why, over the last month, that he increased the monetary aggregates by about $155 billion under M3.
[01:04:17.306 --> 01:04:18.186]  And that is one of the reasons.
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:32.028]  Bob, we've got a break, but when we get back, I want to explain what M2, M3 money supplies are, what liquidity means.
[01:04:32.868 --> 01:04:34.910]  Basically, the printing presses are on fire.
[01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:36.031]  They're printing so fast.
[01:04:36.391 --> 01:04:38.233]  They're at light speed warp 10.
[01:04:38.953 --> 01:04:41.835]  And I want to get into how they manipulate the numbers.
[01:04:41.876 --> 01:04:46.039]  I mean, one example is, they don't count people as unemployed who go off the rolls.
[01:04:46.399 --> 01:04:50.983]  So a million people go off the rolls because it's run out, and they say, oh, a million new jobs.
[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:58.068]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:04:58.268 --> 01:05:02.616]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:05:05.196 --> 01:05:06.516]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:05:23.982 --> 01:05:34.446]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:05:34.726 --> 01:05:40.108]  If you want to understand what the new old order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:05:40.608 --> 01:05:44.009]  Visit infowars.com or prisonplanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:05:44.029 --> 01:05:44.369]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:05:44.389 --> 01:05:45.670]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:05:53.252 --> 01:05:56.493]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:05:56.573 --> 01:06:00.755]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:06:01.015 --> 01:06:03.795]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:06:03.996 --> 01:06:06.376]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:06:06.576 --> 01:06:15.219]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:06:15.419 --> 01:06:16.760]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:21.101]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:06:21.441 --> 01:06:21.761]  I think so.
[01:07:00.943 --> 01:07:03.923]  Not getting all the news that's fit to print due to mainstream press censors?
[01:07:04.183 --> 01:07:07.524]  Then subscribe to America's newspaper, the American Free Press.
[01:07:07.804 --> 01:07:12.885]  No censors, no spin doctors, and no government snoops here, just honest news that affects you.
[01:07:13.185 --> 01:07:20.386]  The American Free Press supports what the majority of Americans want, like lower taxes, stopping illegal immigration, and ending our meddling in foreign affairs.
[01:07:20.886 --> 01:07:27.069]  The American Free Press supports the American people and now you can become a subscriber to the AFP with an incredible offer.

[01:07:50.280 --> 01:08:06.007]  All right, my friends, I know we have a lot of phone lines.
[01:08:06.027 --> 01:08:07.768]  Your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:08:07.788 --> 01:08:13.451]  I want to try to keep Bob Chapman on the can a little bit into the next hour as well, so we have plenty of time to go over all of this.
[01:08:14.304 --> 01:08:17.347]  But Bob, for those that just joined us, it's always good to reintroduce this.
[01:08:17.367 --> 01:08:22.632]  And then I want to go into how the economy really works and what it means to have a plunging dollar and what we're facing.
[01:08:22.672 --> 01:08:35.625]  But first off, how did you discover the New World Order being at the pinnacle of economic success, one of the most highly respected names on the stock market and on gold and other metals?
[01:08:36.927 --> 01:08:38.088]  I want people to realize that.
[01:08:39.033 --> 01:08:44.877]  But how did you discover what the New World Order is, and then for those in a nutshell, what is the New World Order?
[01:08:46.357 --> 01:08:53.122]  Well, I discovered it when I was involved in counterintelligence, because things were happening that just didn't make any sense to me.
[01:08:53.882 --> 01:08:59.946]  And after I left, I spoke with people who knew what was going on, and they filled me in in the early 1960s.
[01:09:00.046 --> 01:09:02.287]  And the New World Order?
[01:09:02.327 --> 01:09:04.188]  The New World Order is a dream
[01:09:07.763 --> 01:09:23.321]  of internationalists who run the financial backdrop for every country in the world and they control most everything that goes on in every country from behind the scenes.
[01:09:23.421 --> 01:09:24.402]  I call them elitists.
[01:09:25.223 --> 01:09:27.726]  Some people call them insiders, conspirators.
[01:09:28.588 --> 01:09:38.210]  And, of course, your listenership knows about the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, etc.
[01:09:40.471 --> 01:09:44.912]  Absolutely, and their goal is serfdom, to enslave the population.
[01:09:44.952 --> 01:09:46.152]  People go, oh, they wouldn't do that.
[01:09:46.192 --> 01:09:48.053]  Well, that's really the history of the world.
[01:09:48.593 --> 01:09:51.394]  It's like the rock and roll song, everybody wants to rule the world.
[01:09:51.434 --> 01:09:56.475]  These guys are really setting up the global mechanism for global taxation, global regulation.
[01:09:57.708 --> 01:10:02.809]  And our freedoms, they could care less about those.
[01:10:02.989 --> 01:10:08.051]  And when people see the economic scene, I don't think they realize that this is manipulated.
[01:10:08.091 --> 01:10:09.351]  This is not free market.
[01:10:09.651 --> 01:10:14.392]  That they want booms and busts to consolidate power and control.
[01:10:14.432 --> 01:10:16.813]  So I guess we should talk about the Federal Reserve
[01:10:18.268 --> 01:10:24.093]  And why they're more than happy, I guess, to have the dollar plunging, and what it means to have a weak dollar.
[01:10:24.614 --> 01:10:33.120]  And then, extrapolating from there, what it means to have the Federal Reserve printing money like the late Weimar Republic in the twenties.
[01:10:34.982 --> 01:10:39.666]  Well, the Federal Reserve is a privately owned organization which is controlled by these people.
[01:10:39.686 --> 01:10:44.950]  And they create the background
[01:10:45.723 --> 01:10:48.105]  Uh, for financial events for the future.
[01:10:48.125 --> 01:10:58.134]  And presently, uh, what they, on behalf of their mentors, are doing is leading the United States towards a depression.
[01:10:59.235 --> 01:11:04.600]  And, um, before that happens, I think you're gonna see inflation to some extent.
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:12.687]  It all depends, uh, on the inflation side of it, whether the President of the United States is impeached.
[01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:29.260]  I think you're going to see over the next several days here since the resignation of two top people in the CIA and the President and Dick Cheney among others hiring criminal attorneys
[01:11:30.594 --> 01:11:43.863]  I think that they've been caught lying about the Valerie Palm thing, and I think it could bring down the government, and I think the Neocons could be out, and I think that there's a possibility that there would be another Republican nominee.
[01:11:44.824 --> 01:11:47.886]  And these are the things that are going on that are affecting
[01:11:49.054 --> 01:12:05.434]  The whole situation and of course the underlying thing is the financial problems which have been created deliberately because what they expected to do was keep the economy going well, get Bush re-elected, and then after the election they let the economy go down.
[01:12:05.534 --> 01:12:07.457]  Now it may come a little bit sooner.
[01:12:08.294 --> 01:12:22.105]  But anyway, the Fed has been pumping money in, and over the last month they put in NM3, which is a conglomeration of most instruments such as checking and savings and commercial paper.
[01:12:22.805 --> 01:12:28.710]  And that increase has been made to increase liquidity in the markets, and I think the main reason
[01:12:29.401 --> 01:12:38.408]  Is to keep Fannie and Freddie afloat, and the secondary reason is to pump more money into the stock market to keep it up prior to the elections.
[01:12:38.508 --> 01:12:41.690]  Okay, Fannie, Freddie, explain to people what that means.
[01:12:42.251 --> 01:12:50.077]  Now, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are two agencies which buy mortgages from people who originate them.
[01:12:50.597 --> 01:12:53.920]  And then they package them and they sell them to investors, but they guarantee them.
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:56.802]  Now, up until just recently,
[01:12:57.503 --> 01:13:06.490]  It's been assumed that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, because they're quasi-governmental organizations, that their worth was guaranteed by the federal government.
[01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:07.211]  Well, it's not.
[01:13:07.811 --> 01:13:17.799]  And they have about $3 trillion worth of paper out there, which is backed by derivatives and a very, very small actual cash and equity position.
[01:13:18.059 --> 01:13:18.800]  So it's a giant bubble.
[01:13:21.312 --> 01:13:31.602]  It's a giant bubble, there's absolutely no question, and that's been generated by 1% prime rate and loans at their lowest point were 5.35% for the 30-year fixed mortgage.
[01:13:31.622 --> 01:13:33.143]  Those rates are up to around 6.25% right now.
[01:13:43.007 --> 01:13:53.736]  As the rates move higher, you're going to have more people having foreclosures, particularly those who have adjustable mortgages called ARMs.
[01:13:54.616 --> 01:14:11.430]  Now, many of those people didn't think interest rates would go higher, and I'm expecting three more points on interest rates using the 10-year Treasury note, which has already gone up 1.20% over the last maybe eight weeks.
[01:14:12.626 --> 01:14:19.071]  And as they go up and their arms come due and they have to renew them, they'll get a higher interest rate.
[01:14:19.091 --> 01:14:21.592]  They won't be able to pay it and they'll walk away from their homes.
[01:14:22.753 --> 01:14:26.956]  And so the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are holding those mortgages.
[01:14:27.996 --> 01:14:30.177]  And then they have to follow these foreclosures.
[01:14:30.477 --> 01:14:32.857]  Now, what does it mean to have a plunging dollar?
[01:14:33.357 --> 01:14:44.700]  The average... I mean, people in Mexico know what it means to have a weak peso, but the average yuppie I talk to think it's funny that the dollar has been devalued, depending on what index you look at, 35 to 46 percent.
[01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:49.181]  Number one, what is the real devaluing in the last two years of the dollar, and what does that mean?
[01:14:50.661 --> 01:14:53.382]  Well, the dollar, since the mid-1970s, is off
[01:14:55.183 --> 01:15:00.506]  A close to 70% in value from inflation over the ensuing years.
[01:15:01.346 --> 01:15:03.908]  But when the dollar goes down, it makes U.S.
[01:15:03.948 --> 01:15:05.269]  goods cheaper overseas.
[01:15:05.449 --> 01:15:08.730]  In the last two years, though, the drop against foreign currency specifically?
[01:15:17.985 --> 01:15:21.808]  Uh, a low on the Euro, we'll use the Euro, of 82.
[01:15:22.249 --> 01:15:27.253]  Uh, and a high on the Euro recently of 130 about six months ago.
[01:15:27.273 --> 01:15:32.037]  Uh, the Euro is, uh, trading around 120 to 122 right now.
[01:15:32.877 --> 01:15:37.261]  And, uh, so that's how much the dollar has gone down against the Euro.
[01:15:37.721 --> 01:15:41.965]  And that's roughly... And we have other measures, uh, such as the switch frank.
[01:15:41.985 --> 01:15:42.866]  And that's roughly 40%.
[01:15:42.906 --> 01:15:43.506]  That's roughly 40% then.
[01:15:47.006 --> 01:15:49.567]  Yes, and I think it's got another 30 or 40 to go.
[01:15:50.588 --> 01:15:53.169]  Now, Bush said last year that a plunging dollar is good.
[01:15:53.229 --> 01:16:11.879]  He said this year that fast food jobs should be indexed as industry jobs, high-tech jobs, and he said that the Congressional Budget Office stated as well that we're going to have seven times the layoffs in the next five years on high tech, and that exporting jobs is our main export, and that it's a good thing.
[01:16:13.467 --> 01:16:16.810]  Well, that's insanity, and any sane person knows that.
[01:16:17.831 --> 01:16:19.433]  He doesn't know what he's talking about.
[01:16:19.453 --> 01:16:26.179]  He may have a master's degree, but he probably has slept through classes.
[01:16:26.419 --> 01:16:30.843]  Well, he obviously knows that's a fraud, but this is the propaganda of putting a good face on it.
[01:16:32.405 --> 01:16:34.487]  Well, most everything that they've done is fraud.
[01:16:35.163 --> 01:16:49.367]  I mean, when this POM affair comes out, people are... I mean, it was bad enough the last couple of weeks to find out that we had outside contractors as well as military personnel raping and torturing and abusing prisoners.
[01:16:50.547 --> 01:17:02.271]  Now we're going to be beset with the exposure of probably one of the most important CIA operatives in the agency.
[01:17:03.607 --> 01:17:18.273]  Out of vindictiveness against your husband Joseph Wilson for saying that the administration was lying about there being uranium that was being shipped to Iraq by a Niger.
[01:17:18.874 --> 01:17:22.175]  And the CIA had told them
[01:17:22.816 --> 01:17:23.697]  The administration.
[01:17:24.017 --> 01:17:25.718]  A year before, but that wasn't true.
[01:17:25.778 --> 01:17:26.539]  It was a lie.
[01:17:26.599 --> 01:17:27.900]  But they used it anyway.
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:30.202]  They just wanted an excuse for war.
[01:17:30.502 --> 01:17:34.525]  Bush still went on the State of the Union and stated it.
[01:17:35.506 --> 01:17:38.808]  So why do you think we see these resignations in the CIA?
[01:17:38.828 --> 01:17:42.051]  There's rumblings of other resignations by Powell and others.
[01:17:42.091 --> 01:17:43.052]  What does that signify?
[01:17:44.012 --> 01:17:45.474]  They want to get out of harm's way.
[01:17:45.614 --> 01:17:48.596]  And once they've resigned, they can testify against them.
[01:17:49.917 --> 01:17:50.918]  That's interesting, isn't it?
[01:17:52.304 --> 01:17:55.086]  Now, I'm hearing this, and I respect you.
[01:17:55.466 --> 01:17:59.888]  You've made a lot of accurate predictions, haven't found really any that you weren't right on.
[01:18:00.449 --> 01:18:05.732]  You've been late on a few things, so we all have, but everything you've broken down has unfortunately come true.
[01:18:05.752 --> 01:18:11.235]  A lot of people are saying that they think there's some type of weird jockeying going on and that this could happen.
[01:18:11.575 --> 01:18:17.098]  I just find it hard to believe Bush has done such a good job of raping America, bringing us into the New World Order.
[01:18:17.799 --> 01:18:21.521]  Why would they change horses with their cousin, Kerry?
[01:18:22.392 --> 01:18:24.694]  Well, I don't think they want to, but they're forced to.
[01:18:24.714 --> 01:18:27.696]  I think it's a power struggle among the elite.
[01:18:28.617 --> 01:18:32.920]  And they're saying, one group is saying to the other, hey, you've made a mess of this thing.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:34.481]  We've got to turn this thing around.
[01:18:34.501 --> 01:18:35.842]  We've got to get you out of there.
[01:18:36.202 --> 01:18:39.605]  Because if you keep on doing it, the whole world's going to come out around our heads.
[01:18:40.045 --> 01:18:44.689]  And when that happens, everybody's going to discover what we've been doing, and they're going to take us out and shoot us.
[01:18:47.901 --> 01:18:53.545]  You know, I'm hearing this from just all these different quarters of respected researchers and individuals.
[01:18:53.585 --> 01:18:55.506]  We're getting this out of British intelligence.
[01:18:56.646 --> 01:18:57.987]  I don't know what to say about it.
[01:18:58.407 --> 01:19:00.169]  I mean, Bush is just a puppet.
[01:19:00.629 --> 01:19:11.776]  So you're thinking the globalists may use Bush as a sacrificial lamb politically to make people believe that the plunging economy and the torture and the CIA sellouts, that all that was Bush?
[01:19:13.257 --> 01:19:15.318]  That's correct, and it's only because they have to.
[01:19:16.255 --> 01:19:18.436]  If they didn't have to, they wouldn't want to get rid of him.
[01:19:18.876 --> 01:19:22.418]  I mean, they had him going on the way for his second term.
[01:19:23.099 --> 01:19:25.940]  And all of these things have come together at the wrong time.
[01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:36.686]  The Europeans, the black nobility in Europe, that is part of this conspiracy, the original part of this conspiracy, if you may, they're furious with him.
[01:19:37.566 --> 01:19:39.407]  Because he's just gone off to deep ends.
[01:19:40.067 --> 01:19:41.788]  And that whole group is so greedy.
[01:19:42.368 --> 01:19:45.130]  I mean, out of 3,000 government contracts, Halliburton,
[01:19:46.116 --> 01:19:46.817]  There's 2,700 of them.
[01:19:46.937 --> 01:19:48.858]  Tell you what, stay there, Incredible.

[01:21:53.504 --> 01:21:57.405]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:21:57.625 --> 01:22:09.909]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:22:10.329 --> 01:22:10.729]  The U.S.
[01:22:10.769 --> 01:22:16.351]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:22:16.751 --> 01:22:18.952]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:22:20.832 --> 01:22:21.892]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:22:21.912 --> 01:22:24.773]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:22:24.893 --> 01:22:30.895]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:22:31.336 --> 01:22:34.677]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[01:24:02.910 --> 01:24:07.494]  The criminals running the New World Order are bloodthirsty, they enjoy power, they are greedy.
[01:24:08.334 --> 01:24:13.118]  There's kind of a mental illness that occurs at high altitudes at the pinnacle of power.
[01:24:13.778 --> 01:24:17.101]  It happens in most cases, the majority of the time throughout history.
[01:24:17.341 --> 01:24:22.325]  You can take a normal, nice person, give them a lot of power, and they'll flip out and turn into tyrants.
[01:24:23.166 --> 01:24:26.208]  Well, you've got inbred families working together
[01:24:27.173 --> 01:24:31.635]  People who funded the Nazis, my friends, in control, and they're going all the way.
[01:24:32.195 --> 01:24:45.642]  And when I said during the last segment, you know, that Bob Chapman's made a lot of predictions that come true and that he's only been late a few times, by that he'll say, I think Gold's going to do this in six months, and it doesn't happen in six months, it happens in eight months.
[01:24:46.382 --> 01:24:48.963]  I mean, just scary accuracy.
[01:24:48.983 --> 01:24:54.806]  You know, frankly, I have a lot of that, you know, same talent at looking at all the different information and integrating it together.
[01:24:56.081 --> 01:25:01.013]  Frankly, I'm getting this from a lot of corners that I respect.
[01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:10.336]  That we could see a major Super Watergate scandal or Bush may go ahead and pull a big terror attack before that happens to smoke screen that out.
[01:25:10.736 --> 01:25:12.157]  Now, I said we'd go to calls in this segment.
[01:25:12.177 --> 01:25:24.606]  We will in the next because I wanted to give Bob Chapman a chance to respond to the government saying there's going to be terror attacks, we're going to have martial law, it's good, all these generals saying this.
[01:25:25.386 --> 01:25:26.467]  Bob, comments on that?
[01:25:28.368 --> 01:25:44.033]  Well, I predicted that about four or five months ago, if the election was close or Mr. Bush was behind, and the latest polls I've seen is that his rating for approval is 42 and 43 percent, and that's considerably behind.
[01:25:44.053 --> 01:25:45.474]  By the way, a new poll out today...
[01:25:47.381 --> 01:26:01.850]  Different agencies, including the White House itself, without even consulting the FBI, CIA, or Homeland Security, their most recent alert came right out of the White House.
[01:26:02.110 --> 01:26:02.750]  Well, they do that.
[01:26:02.770 --> 01:26:06.993]  So they're getting people ready for a terrorist event, which they won't plan.
[01:26:07.013 --> 01:26:09.454]  Well, no, I totally agree with you.
[01:26:11.471 --> 01:26:13.452]  Now the question is, how do we stop them?
[01:26:13.492 --> 01:26:14.672]  So what do you see happening?
[01:26:14.732 --> 01:26:18.713]  I mean, just extrapolating, not a prediction, but what you think, you know, probabilities here.
[01:26:19.133 --> 01:26:24.555]  You think they'll go ahead and carry out a big terror attack that'll kind of nullify all these other investigations?
[01:26:25.035 --> 01:26:27.095]  Or will the elite allow them to do that?
[01:26:27.115 --> 01:26:29.416]  It's hard to say.
[01:26:30.056 --> 01:26:31.337]  It's really hard to say.
[01:26:33.177 --> 01:26:35.898]  I don't know whether he can act unilaterally.
[01:26:37.098 --> 01:26:40.099]  It can go either way.
[01:26:41.102 --> 01:26:48.947]  If we do have that kind of an act, and we do have martial law, then they're going to have to face the window of opportunity.
[01:26:49.708 --> 01:26:55.191]  And that is that window so they can go forward and implement world government.
[01:26:55.511 --> 01:27:00.094]  But at the same time, when they do that, everybody in the world is going to know what they're doing.
[01:27:00.114 --> 01:27:04.597]  And because of people like you and I, they're going to know why they're doing it.
[01:27:05.097 --> 01:27:06.478]  And they stand a great
[01:27:07.139 --> 01:27:09.240]  Well, you know, I tend to agree with you.
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:10.041]  Before 9-11,
[01:27:34.773 --> 01:27:42.328]  I got enough clear information in their propaganda reading how they were trying to prepare the public that I went on air and I said call the White House
[01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:48.012]  Call the Congress, tell them, don't use your Patsy Bin Laden to attack the World Trade Centers.
[01:27:48.792 --> 01:27:54.394]  I mean, that's how much information I had, and that was on the record on radio and TV, and that's in my film, Masters of Terror.
[01:27:54.554 --> 01:28:03.057]  And everybody heard me for a month straight, coming up before 9-11, off and on, spending three hours, sometimes a day, warning people, because it was specific.
[01:28:03.177 --> 01:28:04.338]  I knew they were about to move.
[01:28:04.418 --> 01:28:05.338]  I saw the arrogance.
[01:28:05.918 --> 01:28:06.959]  Now I see fear.
[01:28:07.299 --> 01:28:08.460]  Now I see confusion.
[01:28:08.781 --> 01:28:14.365]  Respected journalistic groups like Capitol Hill Blue say Bush is throwing fits, cussing, screaming at people.
[01:28:14.925 --> 01:28:16.987]  He thinks he's been cut loose by the elite.
[01:28:17.728 --> 01:28:19.549]  But at the same time, that could be disinfo.
[01:28:19.929 --> 01:28:21.871]  I mean, I've never seen such a fog.
[01:28:21.891 --> 01:28:25.354]  A fog, though, with these glimpses of big rocks ahead.
[01:28:25.374 --> 01:28:31.859]  No matter which way you cut it, Alex, it's bad.
[01:28:37.475 --> 01:28:40.936]  But I've never not been able to really put my finger on it.
[01:28:41.437 --> 01:28:43.797]  So basically, it's just chaos then.
[01:28:44.738 --> 01:28:45.118]  It is.
[01:28:45.298 --> 01:28:49.600]  And we're not going to know what's going to happen until it happens.
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:53.341]  And if we go into the election, he may get impeached.
[01:28:53.761 --> 01:28:55.122]  On the other hand, he may not.
[01:28:55.982 --> 01:28:57.143]  We may have martial law.
[01:28:57.203 --> 01:28:57.903]  We may not.
[01:28:58.493 --> 01:29:08.224]  Everything is up in the air and that's why being in hard assets like gold and silver stocks and coins is a very good idea because they're very protective during times like that.
[01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:16.864]  And also, the regular stock market could become a victim if some of these things happen, which are negative.
[01:29:17.385 --> 01:29:30.792]  Although I do believe that the Federal Reserve is doing its best to drive the market higher, and I think that was part of the deal that Mr. Greenspan made with Mr. Bush to get re-nominated for another term.
[01:29:31.412 --> 01:29:34.214]  And that was to keep the market up or bring it higher.
[01:29:34.374 --> 01:29:36.576]  And then we heard... To show financial results.
[01:29:36.776 --> 01:29:40.458]  And then we heard the Saudis were going to pump more oil right before the election, and now they're doing that.
[01:29:40.698 --> 01:29:41.239]  We'll come back.
[01:29:41.279 --> 01:29:42.960]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:29:44.241 --> 01:29:45.181]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.642 --> 01:29:47.243]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.263 --> 01:29:50.945]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:54.047 --> 01:30:00.972]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America, why the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[01:30:02.236 --> 01:30:06.299]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:14.066]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[01:30:14.967 --> 01:30:23.714]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.

[01:30:54.338 --> 01:30:55.938]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:30:56.078 --> 01:31:03.200]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years, but what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:10.001]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:31:10.181 --> 01:31:13.182]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:31:13.402 --> 01:31:15.782]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:31:15.902 --> 01:31:20.503]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[01:31:20.563 --> 01:31:21.304]  We're good to go!
[01:31:45.145 --> 01:31:45.566]  803-4438.
[01:31:45.626 --> 01:31:46.068]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:31:46.088 --> 01:31:48.334]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:31:54.278 --> 01:31:55.278]  It's finally here!
[01:31:55.418 --> 01:31:56.379]  Spring has arrived!
[01:31:56.579 --> 01:31:59.539]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:31:59.759 --> 01:32:03.220]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:11.582]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[01:32:11.842 --> 01:32:15.563]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[01:32:15.783 --> 01:32:20.804]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[01:32:21.084 --> 01:32:25.590]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:29.855]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[01:32:29.935 --> 01:32:37.064]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn!
[01:32:37.364 --> 01:32:42.825]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[01:32:43.025 --> 01:32:44.946]  Call the Ark Institute toll free at 800-255-1912.
[01:32:45.006 --> 01:32:47.006]  That's 1-800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com today.
[01:33:08.095 --> 01:33:18.565]  Alright, we're going to get back to Bob Chapman here in about four or five minutes and I promise we'll go to Mark and Kevin and Fred and Kevin and a bunch of other people that are patiently holding.
[01:33:18.585 --> 01:33:19.446]  We're going to get to you.
[01:33:20.267 --> 01:33:25.752]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com and we do live in interesting times.
[01:33:25.772 --> 01:33:31.398]  We're on the edge of going either to the next level of tyranny or giving tyranny quite a blow.
[01:33:32.561 --> 01:33:42.312]  But again, the globalists have got it set up where they can burn Apache-like Bush, who's really just a minion of them, a puppet, and then put in his cousin, his skull and bones buddy, Kerry.
[01:33:42.352 --> 01:33:47.238]  So there's a larger program going on here, but as Bob Chapman said, the globalists are so greedy.
[01:33:48.483 --> 01:33:53.228]  Out of 3,000 contracts, 2,700 plus go to Halliburton alone.
[01:33:53.248 --> 01:33:54.590]  $1,200,000,000 missing from the Pentagon.
[01:33:54.850 --> 01:33:59.555]  You know, forget this article today about $100,000,000 in unused plane tickets by the Pentagon.
[01:33:59.615 --> 01:34:01.217]  I mean, that's chunk change.
[01:34:01.998 --> 01:34:07.904]  There's a mass looting going on, and we'll talk about that as well after some of your calls and get into ways to protect yourself.
[01:34:07.924 --> 01:34:08.705]  But before we do that,
[01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:12.411]  I want to bring Jim Shepard up on the air.
[01:34:12.431 --> 01:34:13.571]  I haven't had him on in a few weeks.
[01:34:13.911 --> 01:34:15.291]  From New Millennium Concepts.
[01:34:15.772 --> 01:34:16.712]  Made in America.
[01:34:16.792 --> 01:34:18.332]  Big sponsors of this broadcast.
[01:34:18.632 --> 01:34:22.894]  A water filtration purification system I use in my home.
[01:34:23.214 --> 01:34:25.194]  That I use when I'm out camping or on the road.
[01:34:25.794 --> 01:34:26.995]  And a great system.
[01:34:27.055 --> 01:34:28.375]  And you want to take control of your life?
[01:34:28.835 --> 01:34:30.996]  Water is 70% of your physical life.
[01:34:31.736 --> 01:34:32.476]  70% of your body.
[01:34:32.796 --> 01:34:33.756]  Have to have it to live.
[01:34:33.956 --> 01:34:36.437]  But forget getting it because there could be a big disaster coming.
[01:34:36.897 --> 01:34:39.298]  Get it because the tap water is full of poison, people!
[01:34:40.038 --> 01:34:41.279]  Jim Shepard, good to have you on.
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:42.661]  Always good to have you on.
[01:34:42.701 --> 01:34:47.785]  You know Alex, I think that a lot of people don't realize what happens when they drink water that's full of contaminants.
[01:34:48.686 --> 01:34:51.929]  And the reason they don't is because typically you get these chronic conditions.
[01:34:52.009 --> 01:34:58.114]  You start getting a little arthritis, little aches and pains, and just these slight chronic problems.
[01:34:58.394 --> 01:35:03.879]  Some people have prostate problems from certain bacterias that are in the water.
[01:35:04.399 --> 01:35:07.502]  And they just don't really realize, they don't connect it with the water because
[01:35:08.018 --> 01:35:15.329]  When you have contaminated water or contaminants in the water, it's not like when you drink it, then five minutes later you feel sick.
[01:35:15.449 --> 01:35:16.631]  That's not the way it works.
[01:35:16.711 --> 01:35:23.922]  The way it works is it starts clogging up your cells, it starts lowering your immune system, your immune system gets overtaxed trying to get rid of all this stuff.
[01:35:24.494 --> 01:35:26.855]  And slowly you just kind of go downhill.
[01:35:26.895 --> 01:35:27.875]  You lose energy.
[01:35:27.915 --> 01:35:29.436]  Your joints start hurting.
[01:35:29.516 --> 01:35:32.397]  And there are hundreds of prestigious medical reports on this.
[01:35:32.477 --> 01:35:42.860]  I mean, a major municipal water supply, mercury, Prozac, Ritalin, birth control pills, high levels of it, fluoride, chlorine, dead bacteria.
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:45.901]  Oh yeah, the chlorine just kills what was alive.
[01:35:45.921 --> 01:35:48.282]  You're still drinking the dead stuff, folks.
[01:35:48.302 --> 01:35:50.523]  Little microscopic chunks of dead meat.
[01:35:50.923 --> 01:35:53.104]  I don't want to be gross here, but I believe in this.
[01:35:53.724 --> 01:35:57.568]  And it's made in America, and you need to take control of your life.
[01:35:57.628 --> 01:35:59.169]  Jim, tell them about the Berkey Light.
[01:35:59.389 --> 01:36:00.610]  Tell them about a couple of specials.
[01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.411]  Okay.
[01:36:01.991 --> 01:36:06.195]  Alex, we have the Berkey Light Special that does not have the light.
[01:36:06.775 --> 01:36:07.056]  That is $199.
[01:36:08.757 --> 01:36:10.739]  And then along with that, you can get a free gift.
[01:36:10.959 --> 01:36:14.582]  You can get the Sport Berkey, $40 Sport Berkey.
[01:36:15.042 --> 01:36:18.025]  We also have a video, or DVD,
[01:36:19.059 --> 01:36:24.143]  ...in place, tells you how to take care of yourself during an emergency like a nuclear, biological event, something like that.
[01:36:24.864 --> 01:36:29.467]  It sets your house up to be a shelter to keep these contaminants away from you and your family.
[01:36:30.728 --> 01:36:33.671]  The other freebie that you can select from is Prudent Places.
[01:36:34.051 --> 01:36:37.033]  This has answers on all the hard information to find.
[01:36:37.133 --> 01:36:38.995]  I mean, stuff you just can't find anywhere.
[01:36:39.915 --> 01:36:44.519]  You know, statistics about anything that you want in the United States.
[01:36:44.579 --> 01:36:48.082]  Demographics, 500 plus color maps, hard to find maps,
[01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:49.840]  Just you name it.
[01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:59.424]  I mean, all the way down to if you're trying to escape a city because there's some sort of an event, which bridges are in disrepair and not to use and that kind of stuff.
[01:36:59.644 --> 01:37:03.045]  By the way, people can also buy these items individually.
[01:37:04.126 --> 01:37:05.106]  That's absolutely right.
[01:37:06.407 --> 01:37:12.529]  And then, of course, you can also pick the potassium iodate, which protects your thyroid in the event of a nuclear event.
[01:37:13.209 --> 01:37:16.030]  We also have the Berkey Light Special with the lights.
[01:37:16.270 --> 01:37:16.491]  That's $2.59.
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:22.823]  And folks can select two of the free gifts that I just mentioned.
[01:37:23.323 --> 01:37:25.044]  And so those are great specials.
[01:37:25.204 --> 01:37:27.225]  And all this stuff is hard to find stuff.
[01:37:27.826 --> 01:37:30.547]  And you know, you mentioned before about the chlorine in the water.
[01:37:31.468 --> 01:37:32.569]  Hey, chlorine is a great thing.
[01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:34.990]  And what it does, it kills bacteria and viruses.
[01:37:35.370 --> 01:37:37.231]  Most bacteria, certain things, it doesn't kill.
[01:37:38.552 --> 01:37:41.694]  But the problem with the chlorine is, anytime you use chlorine,
[01:37:42.182 --> 01:37:47.124]  The byproduct is triamethylenes, which are carcinogenic.
[01:37:47.144 --> 01:37:49.385]  They're cancer-causing agents that are in the water.
[01:37:49.405 --> 01:37:53.646]  Well, look, I mean, folks, when you get in a pool that has higher levels in your tap water, it burns your eyes.
[01:37:53.686 --> 01:37:54.446]  It smells bad.
[01:37:54.486 --> 01:37:56.027]  I mean, this is not good for you people.
[01:37:56.607 --> 01:37:58.008]  And look, I mean, that's why I believe in this.
[01:37:58.048 --> 01:37:58.608]  I promote it.
[01:37:59.688 --> 01:38:04.971]  Give New Millennium a call, my friends, at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:38:05.071 --> 01:38:07.272]  That's 1-888-803-4438.
[01:38:08.453 --> 01:38:16.076]  These are top-of-the-line filtration systems of the universities that have looked at it and put out the reports.
[01:38:16.397 --> 01:38:19.678]  A new level of purification made in America.
[01:38:19.758 --> 01:38:21.239]  I'm sorry it's not made in China.
[01:38:21.259 --> 01:38:21.319]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:38:23.780 --> 01:38:24.360]  803-4438.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.321]  If you call and it's busy, leave your name and number.
[01:38:28.661 --> 01:38:31.362]  If they get busy, they'll call you right back.
[01:38:31.382 --> 01:38:33.382]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:38:33.602 --> 01:38:36.183]  Or go to Berkeywater.com.
[01:38:36.203 --> 01:38:37.783]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you to get the specials.
[01:38:38.143 --> 01:38:40.564]  Look at the filters, what they have, how easy they are to put together.
[01:38:40.824 --> 01:38:41.684]  Takes about two minutes.
[01:38:41.924 --> 01:38:42.964]  This took me about a minute and a half.
[01:38:43.204 --> 01:38:50.506]  And by the way, Alex, for folks that want to order on the web, go up there and order either the Berkey Lite or the Berkey Lite with Lite.
[01:38:51.092 --> 01:38:59.676]  And then in the comments section, when you order, tell them Alex Jones sent you to enlist the freebie that you want, and that's how you do it on the air.
[01:38:59.936 --> 01:39:00.936]  Tell them what free gift you want.
[01:39:00.976 --> 01:39:04.258]  Berkeywater.com or you can also do it at InfoWars.com.
[01:39:04.938 --> 01:39:06.258]  Jim, thanks for coming on and take care.
[01:39:06.559 --> 01:39:07.239]  Always a pleasure.
[01:39:07.279 --> 01:39:07.859]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:39:07.899 --> 01:39:08.639]  Good to hear from you.
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:16.163]  Alright, going back to our guest, Bob Chapman, and later we'll tell you about the International Forecast Review if you want a complimentary copy of that.
[01:39:16.583 --> 01:39:17.763]  Just powerful info.
[01:39:17.803 --> 01:39:18.984]  This isn't the pap you get.
[01:39:19.444 --> 01:39:32.096]  We're going to go to the calls in about 60 seconds, but Bob, when I listen to the financial talk show host on the radio and I occasionally watch TV, it is such a false reality of lies they're putting out.
[01:39:32.456 --> 01:39:37.281]  Just from the other professional journals I read, they have to know they're congenital liars.
[01:39:38.382 --> 01:39:39.763]  They're putting out all these lies.
[01:39:40.884 --> 01:39:41.965]  How do you deal with that?
[01:39:43.419 --> 01:39:48.265]  Well, I know what the lies are, so I just skirt them and look for what meat I can find.
[01:39:48.285 --> 01:39:51.108]  I go through 300 pieces of research a day.
[01:39:51.168 --> 01:39:53.330]  I probably answer over 100 emails a day.
[01:39:54.211 --> 01:39:57.975]  And so I get a lot of exposure, and I've been doing this for many, many years.
[01:39:58.015 --> 01:39:58.656]  This is my 45th year.
[01:40:00.091 --> 01:40:04.673]  And I did research prior to that, so it's almost 50 years of doing research of one kind or another.
[01:40:05.133 --> 01:40:11.797]  So you can spot the good stuff and the bad stuff, and you've got to have a good memory, and you've got to be sharp, and I can do that.
[01:40:12.017 --> 01:40:15.638]  I mean, all the real economic numbers are in trouble.
[01:40:15.678 --> 01:40:16.959]  And believe me, I don't like this, folks.
[01:40:16.979 --> 01:40:19.961]  We're all, even though this is a fiat system, we're all tied to it.
[01:40:20.241 --> 01:40:24.163]  But meanwhile, they're telling us it's the greatest things in sliced bread, that it's milk and honey.
[01:40:24.363 --> 01:40:27.084]  But then I talk to everybody on the street, and they're going, man, it's worse than ever.
[01:40:28.932 --> 01:40:30.233]  That's right.
[01:40:30.333 --> 01:40:32.695]  It's amazing.
[01:40:33.155 --> 01:40:35.817]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in West Virginia.
[01:40:36.317 --> 01:40:37.218]  Mark, thanks for holding.
[01:40:37.238 --> 01:40:37.658]  Go ahead.
[01:40:37.979 --> 01:40:38.759]  You're welcome, Alex.
[01:40:39.359 --> 01:40:41.581]  I have a quick comment and then a question.
[01:40:41.961 --> 01:40:54.630]  The comment is, I think this issue with the Mexican truckers displacing the jobs of American truckers could be the thing that turns the tide and allows the American people to know that they're
[01:40:56.041 --> 01:40:57.861]  We've been taken over by a shadow government.
[01:40:57.881 --> 01:41:02.762]  They're not even going to be searched, but citizens are on the street corners in the middle of the country.
[01:41:03.383 --> 01:41:05.263]  Thousands of trucks pouring across.
[01:41:05.623 --> 01:41:07.544]  Supreme Court saying there's nothing you can do.
[01:41:07.624 --> 01:41:11.964]  They get 3 cents a mile when an American truck driver gets 30 cents a mile.
[01:41:12.165 --> 01:41:13.705]  That's a whole other industry.
[01:41:14.085 --> 01:41:19.806]  A higher level blue collar job where you can make a good living for your family being destroyed and this is the plan.
[01:41:19.846 --> 01:41:20.206]  Go ahead.
[01:41:20.626 --> 01:41:22.607]  Yeah, American truckers aren't going to put up with it.
[01:41:22.647 --> 01:41:23.287]  I'm sure of that.
[01:41:23.867 --> 01:41:28.388]  My question is kind of a lengthy one, but I think it's germane to your guest here today.
[01:41:29.108 --> 01:41:31.749]  I'm reaching out to you and your guests and your listeners.
[01:41:33.029 --> 01:41:36.870]  In 1978 or 79, when the Iranians overtook the U.S.
[01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:39.490]  Embassy and took those hostages... Yeah, in Tehran.
[01:41:40.170 --> 01:41:40.550]  Yes, sir.
[01:41:40.590 --> 01:41:49.052]  They also took possession of a top-secret, classified diplomatic and intelligence library.
[01:41:49.577 --> 01:41:59.583]  And since that time, the Iranians, publishing in their own language, have published like 70 volumes called Documents from the Nest of Spies.
[01:42:00.224 --> 01:42:04.466]  And to my knowledge, they've never been translated from Farsi into English.
[01:42:05.067 --> 01:42:13.352]  And I'm wondering if you or your guest or somebody knows somewhere on the web or at some library in North America or Europe where these
[01:42:13.914 --> 01:42:17.397]  Documents from the nest of spies have been translated into English.
[01:42:17.617 --> 01:42:22.941]  That would be interesting, but it's pretty old intelligence, and plus anything that's going to be in a consul probably wouldn't be of the highest level.
[01:42:23.482 --> 01:42:24.462]  Comments, Bob?
[01:42:25.723 --> 01:42:39.234]  The United States government has forbidden professional journals and scientific journals from Iran and Iraq and some of the other countries over there from being translated in the United States.
[01:42:41.101 --> 01:42:42.321]  So there's your answer.
[01:42:42.381 --> 01:42:43.081]  Thanks for the call.
[01:42:43.662 --> 01:42:45.102]  I appreciate it, Mark.
[01:42:45.162 --> 01:42:46.122]  Kevin in Colorado.
[01:42:46.142 --> 01:42:46.782]  Kevin, go ahead.
[01:42:47.282 --> 01:42:47.583]  Hello.
[01:42:47.643 --> 01:42:48.163]  Hey, Alex.
[01:42:48.463 --> 01:42:51.263]  I've been on hold a long time, so I hope you'll give me a moment to get through this tonight.
[01:42:51.383 --> 01:42:52.804]  It was before your current guest came on.
[01:42:52.824 --> 01:42:53.284]  That's fine.
[01:42:53.304 --> 01:42:53.664]  Go ahead.
[01:42:54.344 --> 01:42:56.405]  Well, I'm a left-wing liberal.
[01:42:56.965 --> 01:42:58.605]  This is a positive call, so don't cut me off.
[01:42:59.005 --> 01:43:02.686]  I'm a left-wing liberal, and I believe in a woman's right to choose.
[01:43:02.726 --> 01:43:03.866]  I believe in gun control.
[01:43:03.906 --> 01:43:05.567]  I believe in socialized medicine.
[01:43:05.947 --> 01:43:10.748]  But, listen, we find ourselves back-to-back in this fight against the Bush administration.
[01:43:11.243 --> 01:43:21.966]  You know, we can disagree, we can have our opinions, and we can work what we think is right out in the open, and keep the American people... And I suppose, let me stop you, I suppose you think Kerry's going to save you.
[01:43:23.186 --> 01:43:28.168]  I don't think Kerry's going to save me, but I don't think Kerry is a corrupt, immoral man.
[01:43:28.228 --> 01:43:28.828]  Oh, come on!
[01:43:28.868 --> 01:43:30.329]  Like, hang on now!
[01:43:30.669 --> 01:43:31.589]  Let me talk, let me talk.
[01:43:32.176 --> 01:43:33.057]  And then let Bob talk.
[01:43:33.097 --> 01:43:35.518]  He's run 50 whitewashes in Congress.
[01:43:35.538 --> 01:43:38.220]  He's the number two whitewasher under Arnold Spector.
[01:43:39.221 --> 01:43:41.983]  The guy is business partners with the Bushes and people.
[01:43:42.523 --> 01:43:44.805]  The guy is a Skull and Bones member.
[01:43:44.825 --> 01:43:46.066]  He's cousins with Bush.
[01:43:46.926 --> 01:43:50.328]  He goes to all these big globalist meetings.
[01:43:50.969 --> 01:43:52.230]  And you're for gun control.
[01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:53.991]  They're building this massive police state.
[01:43:54.291 --> 01:43:56.613]  Bush is for gun control, by the way.
[01:43:56.913 --> 01:44:00.095]  And you want my guns so they can have their way with me.
[01:44:00.155 --> 01:44:01.216]  Bob Chapman comments.
[01:44:02.606 --> 01:44:07.948]  Well, I think you've pretty well covered it, and that's why I tell people to go to a third-party candidate.
[01:44:08.469 --> 01:44:13.451]  And yes, that's why they do want our weapons, and once they're gone, we're dead.
[01:44:13.471 --> 01:44:22.235]  I mean, sir, can't you get past the... Look, look, the government, Mark, or excuse me, Kevin,
[01:44:23.371 --> 01:44:26.472]  Created the U.N., created the gun control movements.
[01:44:26.912 --> 01:44:28.052]  They control the left.
[01:44:28.152 --> 01:44:30.093]  They control your so-called alternative.
[01:44:30.453 --> 01:44:30.753]  Why?
[01:44:30.773 --> 01:44:35.674]  Hey, I bet you're not against Che Guevara having an AK-47, but why are you against the citizen having it?
[01:44:36.215 --> 01:44:44.377]  Well, Alex, we're going to be ideologically opposed on a lot of things, but there's a very specific and real danger that we're working together.
[01:44:44.437 --> 01:44:45.137]  Answer my question!
[01:44:45.157 --> 01:44:46.617]  You're the one that brought up gun control!
[01:44:47.077 --> 01:44:47.938]  What's wrong with you?
[01:44:49.478 --> 01:44:50.118]  Come on, man!
[01:44:50.158 --> 01:44:51.499]  Hitler was for gun control!
[01:44:51.539 --> 01:44:52.539]  Don't you understand that?
[01:44:54.271 --> 01:44:54.893]  I do understand that.
[01:44:54.933 --> 01:44:55.534]  It's not funny!
[01:44:55.655 --> 01:44:57.380]  It's their building concentration camps!
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:58.524]  Did you just hear Bob?
[01:44:58.905 --> 01:44:59.807]  Did you just hear Bob?
[01:44:59.968 --> 01:45:01.753]  What's gonna happen if they get our guns, buddy?
[01:45:02.577 --> 01:45:08.219]  No, I mean, we have to disagree on a few points, but yet we also have to work together on a common problem.
[01:45:08.359 --> 01:45:12.080]  I mean, we both have a common problem in this Bush administration.
[01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:12.801]  Do you not agree?
[01:45:12.821 --> 01:45:16.702]  No, we have a problem with the whole system that controls people like Bush.
[01:45:17.142 --> 01:45:26.786]  And that's why things never get better, because the left in America thinks it's just the Republicans, and the right in America thinks it's the Democrats, when they're Siamese twins!
[01:45:27.366 --> 01:45:27.986]  Go ahead, Bob.
[01:45:29.170 --> 01:45:34.315]  Well, I agree with you, and that leaves us really no one to vote for except third-party candidates.
[01:45:34.955 --> 01:45:40.520]  And perhaps they can't win, but the point is, at least people can express themselves.
[01:45:41.461 --> 01:45:50.910]  This locomotive that's going forward is under great power, and whether we can sidetrack it or not remains to be seen.
[01:45:50.930 --> 01:45:52.411]  Well, let me ask Kevin a question.
[01:45:52.811 --> 01:45:53.712]  Kevin, do you think the U.N.
[01:45:53.792 --> 01:45:54.413]  is going to save us?
[01:45:55.754 --> 01:45:56.895]  I don't think the U.N.
[01:45:56.975 --> 01:45:58.616]  is going to save us, no.
[01:45:58.717 --> 01:46:01.058]  But I do support the U.N.'
[01:46:01.038 --> 01:46:02.900]  's role, and I think the U.N.
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:05.862]  is a very noble and purposeful body.
[01:46:05.943 --> 01:46:08.505]  Created by the military-industrial complex in this country.
[01:46:08.825 --> 01:46:11.267]  By the way, let me expand on that for you.
[01:46:12.128 --> 01:46:13.549]  Okay, because this is an important call.
[01:46:14.169 --> 01:46:16.091]  Okay, and I hope everybody bears with us.
[01:46:16.111 --> 01:46:16.812]  Just hold on a minute.
[01:46:16.872 --> 01:46:18.213]  Hold on a minute, sir.
[01:46:19.686 --> 01:46:21.347]  I said two years ago the U.N.
[01:46:21.367 --> 01:46:24.209]  would come in and take over Iraq, playing the part of the good cop.
[01:46:24.409 --> 01:46:25.030]  The U.N.
[01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:25.510]  said that.
[01:46:25.850 --> 01:46:27.071]  It's staged, sir.
[01:46:27.192 --> 01:46:27.892]  It's theater.
[01:46:28.292 --> 01:46:29.733]  Can't you wake up to that?
[01:46:30.094 --> 01:46:31.475]  Can't you understand the U.N.
[01:46:31.495 --> 01:46:33.056]  has murdered millions worldwide?
[01:46:33.256 --> 01:46:33.697]  The U.N.
[01:46:33.757 --> 01:46:34.998]  is infinitely corrupted.
[01:46:35.018 --> 01:46:38.140]  It's a tool of the... Bob, explain to him what the U.N.
[01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:38.400]  is.
[01:46:39.321 --> 01:46:41.363]  Well, it's exactly what you said, and more.
[01:46:41.763 --> 01:46:44.245]  It's going to become the housing for world government.
[01:46:45.067 --> 01:46:58.434]  And when world government comes, we lose our sovereignty, you lose your citizenship, you become a member of the world, and then from some place in Brussels or London or wherever it is, they're going to dictate to you how you're going to live.
[01:46:58.814 --> 01:47:05.978]  And that has already begun under the World Trade Organization, and NAFTA, and the proposed FTAA, and these are instruments
[01:47:06.548 --> 01:47:09.391]  Yeah, and by the way, they say that in their own documents.
[01:47:09.431 --> 01:47:11.493]  You should get road to tyranny.
[01:47:11.553 --> 01:47:12.914]  By the way, you know the U.N.'
[01:47:12.874 --> 01:47:14.295]  's for NAFTA and GATT.
[01:47:14.655 --> 01:47:16.857]  They're for all these policies that Bush is for.
[01:47:25.585 --> 01:47:30.107]  It's the UN, UNESCO, pushing, putting all the children on Ritalin and Prozac.
[01:47:30.427 --> 01:47:33.268]  I mean, I don't think, sir, I think you listen to the rhetoric.
[01:47:33.829 --> 01:47:36.470]  I don't think you know what the UN is really all about.
[01:47:37.030 --> 01:47:39.551]  Well, if I may make my point.
[01:47:40.313 --> 01:47:47.779]  It may be a small point, but I only called to make this one point, okay, and I was trying to lay the groundwork for it, and we are diametrically opposed on a number of issues.
[01:47:47.979 --> 01:47:50.041]  You're on the right, I believe, I'm on the left.
[01:47:50.141 --> 01:47:52.883]  Sure, I'm way past, I'm way past the left-right paradigm.
[01:47:53.344 --> 01:47:57.968]  Well, okay, okay, but some would argue that you're just far right.
[01:47:58.128 --> 01:47:59.469]  My point is... Yeah, exactly!
[01:47:59.509 --> 01:48:00.930]  You're not listening to what I say!
[01:48:01.070 --> 01:48:02.511]  I listen to what you say!
[01:48:02.591 --> 01:48:02.972]  Hold on!
[01:48:03.352 --> 01:48:07.936]  I can debate my facts with points and history and legislation and
[01:48:10.057 --> 01:48:14.240]  All you say is that's your opinion, moral relativism.
[01:48:14.620 --> 01:48:23.246]  When men in black ski masks come and take you to a forced labor camp, buddy, and I've been to them, all your talk about moral relativism doesn't matter.
[01:48:23.386 --> 01:48:24.567]  This is the real deal.
[01:48:24.727 --> 01:48:25.868]  You better grow up!
[01:48:26.128 --> 01:48:27.249]  You better grow up!
[01:48:27.629 --> 01:48:29.630]  We agree on moral relativism.
[01:48:29.730 --> 01:48:30.211]  We agree.
[01:48:30.311 --> 01:48:38.996]  I don't believe that moral relativism is valuable, and I think a good example of moral relativism is watching this Bush administration condone torture in the name of protecting us from terror.
[01:48:39.036 --> 01:48:42.137]  But were you complaining when Bill Clinton was supporting School of America?
[01:48:43.538 --> 01:48:44.339]  No, I was not.
[01:48:45.519 --> 01:48:47.480]  In fact, I am a strong Clinton supporter.
[01:48:47.901 --> 01:48:50.502]  We disagree on a number of things, sir.
[01:48:50.542 --> 01:48:54.965]  But we stand back-to-back in our agreement on the danger of this Bush administration.
[01:48:55.005 --> 01:48:55.705]  This is my point.
[01:48:56.573 --> 01:48:59.574]  Wait a minute, Clinton said he likes Bush and Bush is doing a good job!
[01:49:01.034 --> 01:49:03.835]  I think you may be taking things slightly out of context.
[01:49:03.895 --> 01:49:07.655]  Do you have anything else to say to this guy?
[01:49:09.176 --> 01:49:22.319]  Well, I think it's a great idea that the left and the right can come together for a common cause or against a common enemy, but I think we see the same intellectual dishonesty that we saw in the 1950s.
[01:49:24.102 --> 01:49:28.684]  And that is, you have to go and find out what the facts are, and when you do, you'll change.
[01:49:28.704 --> 01:49:29.585]  You'll come to the middle.
[01:49:32.006 --> 01:49:34.848]  Okay, thanks for the call, Kevin.
[01:49:34.908 --> 01:49:39.490]  Look, I mean, I'm glad you're listening, but just please don't call up and tell me how I need to turn my guns in.
[01:49:39.630 --> 01:49:41.391]  We're not going to get along.
[01:49:42.292 --> 01:49:43.292]  Fred in Philadelphia.
[01:49:43.332 --> 01:49:44.013]  Fred, go ahead.
[01:49:44.793 --> 01:49:51.797]  Alex, I want to talk about the economy and even the mainstream
[01:49:53.541 --> 01:49:56.504]  Uh, people on Wall Street are nervous.
[01:49:56.524 --> 01:49:58.305]  You can tell on the sound of their voices.
[01:49:59.486 --> 01:50:01.027]  They're worried about the economy.
[01:50:01.047 --> 01:50:03.049]  It's a subsidized economy.
[01:50:03.089 --> 01:50:05.511]  The interest rates are artificially low.
[01:50:06.411 --> 01:50:08.233]  And I just wanted to ask your guests what
[01:50:09.130 --> 01:50:12.251]  What do you think will happen with these interest rates in the housing market?
[01:50:12.431 --> 01:50:14.532]  I'll tell you what, stay there because we were about to break.
[01:50:14.552 --> 01:50:18.914]  We don't have time to answer that until after the next segment, so stay there.
[01:50:19.815 --> 01:50:20.935]  Fred, we'll come back to you.
[01:50:21.135 --> 01:50:22.396]  Let Bob Chapman answer that.
[01:50:22.416 --> 01:50:23.436]  We'll keep into the next hour.
[01:50:23.476 --> 01:50:26.978]  Then we'll go to Kevin and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:50:27.338 --> 01:50:28.798]  Total free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:50:28.818 --> 01:50:30.079]  Don't forget my new website.
[01:50:30.319 --> 01:50:31.440]  It's an amazing website, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:38.138 --> 01:50:47.345]  And on Infowars.com, we didn't get it posted yesterday, it is posted today, we have the National Geographic photo of a satanic ritual at Bohemian Grove.
[01:50:47.645 --> 01:50:51.228]  From National Geographic, doesn't get any more in your face than that.
[01:50:54.088 --> 01:50:55.570]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:55.770 --> 01:50:58.853]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:50:58.993 --> 01:51:02.876]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:51:02.936 --> 01:51:07.160]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:51:07.521 --> 01:51:11.284]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:51:11.384 --> 01:51:13.266]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:51:13.446 --> 01:51:16.770]  Riot police attack people on the street indiscriminately.
[01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:17.891]  The medical bills!
[01:51:19.472 --> 01:51:21.493]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[01:51:21.633 --> 01:51:24.675]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:51:24.855 --> 01:51:27.737]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:51:28.218 --> 01:51:34.342]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:51:34.862 --> 01:51:38.665]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[01:51:39.065 --> 01:51:40.426]  Order your video today.
[01:51:40.827 --> 01:51:41.847]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.

[01:51:53.536 --> 01:51:58.782]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:51:58.922 --> 01:52:07.012]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:52:07.272 --> 01:52:14.340]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:52:15.261 --> 01:52:21.746]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:52:21.946 --> 01:52:27.030]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:52:27.150 --> 01:52:36.037]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:52:36.297 --> 01:52:39.579]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:54:04.395 --> 01:54:06.036]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:54:06.076 --> 01:54:07.237]  The third hour is coming up.
[01:54:07.277 --> 01:54:08.517]  Bob Chapman is going to stay with us.
[01:54:08.697 --> 01:54:12.820]  He's got a bunch of news that I want to get his take on, his analysis on.
[01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:15.001]  I know we have loaded phone lines.
[01:54:15.021 --> 01:54:16.161]  We're about to go back to your calls.
[01:54:17.002 --> 01:54:21.944]  I'm going to get Bob's response in the next hour or two to what life will be like under the new world order.
[01:54:21.964 --> 01:54:30.249]  I mean, we're already inside the gates of it, but as we burrow deeper into the bowels of it, if they succeed, what will life be like under these control freaks?
[01:54:31.286 --> 01:54:36.722]  Before we do that though, I have made 10 films, written a book, published a book, carry a bunch of other great books and videos.
[01:54:37.758 --> 01:54:41.060]  that expose the true horror of the globalists.
[01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:42.141]  You need to have them.
[01:54:42.421 --> 01:54:50.226]  So visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to peruse, to watch video clips, to read about the films and books, to order them.

[01:55:01.893 --> 01:55:08.758]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:55:08.878 --> 01:55:09.558]  Take action.
[01:55:09.819 --> 01:55:13.301]  These videos and books are powerful and they're waking people up in a big way.
[01:55:13.561 --> 01:55:14.942]  These are tools that we know work.
[01:55:15.522 --> 01:55:18.104]  Another tool is Bob Chapman's International Forecaster.

[01:55:27.490 --> 01:55:29.712]  Bob, how do folks get your current issue?
[01:55:30.808 --> 01:55:32.470]  Well, I can call the toll-free number 877-479-8178.
[01:55:32.490 --> 01:55:33.751]  And I'll repeat that.
[01:55:33.811 --> 01:55:35.252]  That is 877-479-8178.
[01:55:35.372 --> 01:55:39.956]  And if they'd like to visit my site, it's called TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:55:39.996 --> 01:55:41.617]  TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:55:57.904 --> 01:56:01.025]  Forecaster is spelled F-O-R-E-C-A-S-T-E-R.
[01:56:01.725 --> 01:56:05.347]  TheInternationalForecaster.com, and what's that toll-free number one more time?
[01:56:05.867 --> 01:56:07.227]  It is 877-479-8178.
[01:56:07.868 --> 01:56:13.170]  Okay, let's go, and we'll get that out again in the next hour.
[01:56:13.890 --> 01:56:16.091]  Let's go back to Fred in Philadelphia.
[01:56:16.371 --> 01:56:19.792]  Fred, we talked about the housing market, the manipulation earlier.
[01:56:19.812 --> 01:56:24.774]  I mean, are you asking what's going to happen, in Bob's opinion, or are you asking why they're doing this?
[01:56:27.502 --> 01:56:28.242]  Fred, you still there?
[01:56:28.543 --> 01:56:29.303]  Yeah, I'm right here.
[01:56:29.343 --> 01:56:29.803]  Can you hear me?
[01:56:29.983 --> 01:56:31.404]  Yeah, I mean, specifically, what's the point?
[01:56:31.664 --> 01:56:39.467]  I think you're going to have a huge sustained rise in mortgage rates.
[01:56:41.307 --> 01:56:43.528]  And that's what Fred's asking me.
[01:56:44.148 --> 01:56:45.689]  And I agree with you, Fred.
[01:56:46.529 --> 01:56:52.651]  The 10-year Treasury note, upon which interest rates are based for mortgages, has already gone up 1.2%.
[01:56:55.112 --> 01:57:00.636]  And what the market is telling the Federal Reserve is that you better move rates up or we're going to move up anyway.
[01:57:01.236 --> 01:57:04.398]  I expect another 3 points to be tacked on to that.
[01:57:04.999 --> 01:57:14.244]  So I expect that the long bond, which is now the 10-year, will be selling somewhere around $8.25 to $8.50 on the yield basis.
[01:57:14.745 --> 01:57:20.348]  And that means 30-year fixed mortgages will be $9.25, $2.50, which is about a point higher.
[01:57:21.249 --> 01:57:22.710]  Now, refis of almost
[01:57:23.499 --> 01:57:28.663]  The big point here is that the housing market has been all that's been basically driving things, correct?
[01:57:28.683 --> 01:57:29.023]  Absolutely.
[01:57:49.860 --> 01:57:55.702]  It has been the key to what they've been doing, and what they've been doing is totally unprecedented historically.
[01:57:56.502 --> 01:58:00.403]  I mean, they are way out on the edge, and they're going to fall off.
[01:58:01.663 --> 01:58:08.485]  And I think they're going to come down anywhere between 20 and 80 percent, depending upon the price of the house and the location, etc.
[01:58:08.785 --> 01:58:18.247]  But isn't that part of the larger plan by the IMF and World Bank, we have our own documents from two years ago, to artificially create these bubbles and then have controlled burstings?
[01:58:19.426 --> 01:58:32.840]  Absolutely, because it puts the public in a total vulnerable position financially, and it forces them to agree with government that wants to introduce one world government.
[01:58:33.261 --> 01:58:40.408]  They can't argue because they don't have any money, or they can't put gas in their car, they don't have any electricity, they can't feed their kids.
[01:58:40.488 --> 01:58:41.850]  We'll be right back with a third hour.
[01:58:44.514 --> 01:58:47.396]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:58:47.736 --> 01:58:50.598]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:58:50.838 --> 01:58:57.042]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[01:58:57.422 --> 01:59:04.727]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[01:59:04.907 --> 01:59:09.010]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.

[01:59:50.569 --> 01:59:51.230]  Big Brother.
[01:59:51.870 --> 01:59:52.931]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:53.651 --> 01:59:54.792]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:54.812 --> 01:59:56.233]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.974 --> 01:59:57.894]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:58.535 --> 02:00:02.478]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.718 --> 02:00:06.781]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.349 --> 02:00:29.345]  My friends, I have publicly published copies of the National Banking Associations and others, 150 years ago, bragging about how they made their money by blowing out economies and then foreclosing on everyone.
[02:00:30.419 --> 02:00:37.321]  The banks, my friends, can take a dollar and then loan out $10, $15, $20 for each dollar that they actually have in their bank account.
[02:00:37.721 --> 02:00:43.383]  And the Federal Reserve prints it out of nothing and creates debt that we owe to the private banks.
[02:00:44.543 --> 02:00:45.723]  It's an incredible scam.
[02:00:46.563 --> 02:00:48.664]  And so they need to have this consolidation.
[02:00:48.704 --> 02:00:49.624]  This is what they do.
[02:00:49.664 --> 02:00:51.005]  This is by design.
[02:00:51.505 --> 02:00:54.946]  And the new Public Works Program is going to be the new national draft.
[02:00:56.526 --> 02:00:58.287]  Different bills have people 18 to 49 being under its control.
[02:01:00.795 --> 02:01:11.158]  We're about to go back to your calls to Kevin and Brian and John and Dylan and Joe and others, but in this short segment, first, the draft.
[02:01:11.539 --> 02:01:18.141]  Talk about the draft, this radical re-engineering of the entire society, and what you think is going to develop, Bob Chapman.
[02:01:19.721 --> 02:01:23.662]  Well, I think you're going to see a lot of people moving their children out of the country.
[02:01:24.783 --> 02:01:28.184]  And the reason I think that is we've received about
[02:01:28.996 --> 02:01:29.416]  I don't know.
[02:01:46.875 --> 02:01:57.201]  I mean, these people come from all walks of life who don't want their children and grandchildren used as cannon fodder in a perpetual war for perpetual peace.
[02:01:57.641 --> 02:02:01.723]  And they also don't want them hauled off to the new U.S.
[02:02:01.803 --> 02:02:13.890]  camp that's being built in Australia to be trained, and then sent to the Middle East, and goodness knows when the children will ever come home again, and the tremendous change it will make in their lives.
[02:02:15.980 --> 02:02:25.064]  The whole thing is a total waste, but what it is, as you said, I call it the new Civilian Conservation Corps.
[02:02:25.904 --> 02:02:35.309]  It's a way to offset the unemployment which will be flooding the streets because of the financial fiasco which they've created.
[02:02:36.505 --> 02:02:42.766]  They're talking about a three million draft for the military and ten million for these domestic corps.
[02:02:43.266 --> 02:02:45.127]  They're going to say, fine, you don't have to go overseas.
[02:02:45.487 --> 02:02:47.067]  You've got to serve domestically.
[02:02:48.447 --> 02:02:49.927]  And I've read what you're going to do.
[02:02:50.047 --> 02:02:53.188]  It is literal East German Stasi type activities, Bob.
[02:02:54.408 --> 02:02:55.488]  Yes, I have too.
[02:02:55.648 --> 02:03:03.850]  And I think the domestic programs outside of the military will be extremely limited.
[02:03:05.522 --> 02:03:10.667]  So you think that's just propaganda they're putting out of, oh don't worry, go along with the draft, you'll get to stay here?
[02:03:12.008 --> 02:03:13.969]  Well, I don't think you're going to stay here.
[02:03:13.989 --> 02:03:20.475]  I think that the brightest and the strongest will be shipped off someplace else.
[02:03:21.656 --> 02:03:29.583]  And that's why I have offered through my website to tell people where I think they should go.
[02:03:30.436 --> 02:03:32.096]  Just as a public service, of course.
[02:03:32.116 --> 02:03:33.597]  Well, I'd like you to talk about that.
[02:03:33.657 --> 02:03:37.317]  I mean, I'm betting, but, you know, that's just the way it is.
[02:03:37.577 --> 02:03:44.678]  Well, I'd like you to talk about that if we take some calls, because part of this New World Order is they've already got a deal with Canada that you can't run there.
[02:03:44.738 --> 02:03:45.519]  They'll send you back.
[02:03:45.919 --> 02:03:47.079]  Other nations are signing on.
[02:03:47.099 --> 02:03:48.739]  They were getting ready for this years ago, Bob.
[02:03:50.719 --> 02:03:51.200]  That's true.
[02:03:51.540 --> 02:03:52.340]  You're absolutely right.
[02:03:52.940 --> 02:03:56.640]  You know, Bill Clinton set up a committee to study reintroducing the draft in 99.
[02:03:56.781 --> 02:03:59.521]  I mean, they've been quietly gearing up for a long time.
[02:04:00.515 --> 02:04:01.375]  That's right.
[02:04:01.435 --> 02:04:03.876]  The bill first went in the hopper almost five years ago.
[02:04:05.337 --> 02:04:09.298]  That's right, and they reintroduced it two years ago, and now I've seen 12 different versions, Bob.
[02:04:09.338 --> 02:04:10.218]  Some are 18 to 49.
[02:04:10.438 --> 02:04:13.559]  We have a lot of sponsors now.
[02:04:13.619 --> 02:04:15.100]  I've named them in the next issue.
[02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:16.960]  Maybe it's the issue that just came out.
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:17.660]  I can't remember.
[02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:20.101]  I write so much it merges after a while.
[02:04:20.621 --> 02:04:26.163]  But anyway, either in this issue that's out this week or the next one, I'll get a list of the sponsors.
[02:04:27.136 --> 02:04:28.316]  Well, doesn't one of the U.S.A.
[02:04:28.396 --> 02:04:38.480]  be written to and told that, uh, which is the congressman, that, and senators, that if you're going to sponsor this thing, we're going to do everything possible to make sure you're not re-elected?
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:40.581]  And it's bipartisan!
[02:04:41.561 --> 02:04:42.822]  We'll be right back with Bob Chapman.
[02:04:42.862 --> 02:04:43.702]  Your call, stay with us.
[02:04:48.504 --> 02:04:53.988]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:04:54.408 --> 02:04:58.651]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:04:58.891 --> 02:05:05.916]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:05:06.297 --> 02:05:12.421]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:05:12.561 --> 02:05:13.762]  There are no side effects.
[02:05:14.102 --> 02:05:17.044]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:05:17.204 --> 02:05:18.105]  Eliminate the cost.
[02:05:18.185 --> 02:05:19.146]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:05:19.526 --> 02:05:26.771]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:05:27.071 --> 02:05:30.454]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[02:05:45.811 --> 02:05:49.272]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:05:49.552 --> 02:05:53.054]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:05:53.134 --> 02:05:57.075]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:05:57.315 --> 02:06:03.457]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:06:03.877 --> 02:06:11.780]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:12.581]  I think so.
[02:06:27.062 --> 02:06:31.105]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:06:31.145 --> 02:06:34.547]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals and operations of the New World Order.
[02:06:34.567 --> 02:06:35.287]  There is a chance
[02:06:55.404 --> 02:06:57.986]  To use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:06:58.106 --> 02:07:00.828]  A New World Order can emerge.
[02:07:01.168 --> 02:07:05.391]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:07:05.451 --> 02:07:12.396]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:07:12.516 --> 02:07:14.538]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:07:14.938 --> 02:07:25.323]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:07:25.523 --> 02:07:30.926]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:07:31.406 --> 02:07:34.788]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:07:34.808 --> 02:07:35.148]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:07:35.168 --> 02:07:36.448]  Order today and spread the word!
[02:07:50.733 --> 02:07:51.373]  Big Brother.
[02:07:52.034 --> 02:07:53.114]  Mainstream media.
[02:07:53.815 --> 02:07:54.915]  Government cover-ups.
[02:07:55.576 --> 02:07:56.376]  You want answers?
[02:07:57.156 --> 02:07:58.037]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:58.057 --> 02:08:02.379]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:02.880 --> 02:08:07.022]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:09.683 --> 02:08:13.866]  You know, there are people who study football.
[02:08:15.146 --> 02:08:30.053]  Frankly, I was one of them in high school, who could tell you about all the professional football teams, all the college teams, the scores, you know, how much their linebackers weigh, and they're experts on that.
[02:08:31.374 --> 02:08:37.116]  So the public isn't stupid, they're just ignorant on areas that they should be informed on.
[02:08:37.196 --> 02:08:39.958]  You know, oh, politics, finances, that's boring.
[02:08:40.298 --> 02:08:42.499]  So they don't even know which end is up.
[02:08:43.903 --> 02:08:46.589]  And that's a recipe to be abused, my friends.
[02:08:47.511 --> 02:08:48.854]  And I'm not tooting my own horn.
[02:08:50.056 --> 02:08:55.106]  Just like Bob Chapman, I spend four, five, six hours a day sometimes reading news wires.
[02:08:57.277 --> 02:09:00.798]  Reading transcripts, looking at legislation, and the picture is clear.
[02:09:00.898 --> 02:09:04.199]  Total tyranny, total despotism emerging.
[02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:13.942]  So I'm not an expert on football anymore, I'm an expert on geopolitical systems and how the left and right are controlled and how things are infiltrated and how they condition the public.
[02:09:14.262 --> 02:09:15.703]  And it's always refreshing to have
[02:09:17.091 --> 02:09:28.717]  Bob Chapman on the show because he obviously is out there scanning and reading and researching and then has that larger world backdrop to look at the spectrum through to kind of filter it.
[02:09:30.038 --> 02:09:31.718]  I do respect his opinion.
[02:09:31.778 --> 02:09:33.279]  It's good to talk to somebody who's informed.
[02:09:35.723 --> 02:09:47.250]  I want to go to these calls here in just a moment, but where are some of the safe places that people want to get their children out of the country that don't have extradition, draft extradition deals like Canada does now?
[02:09:48.691 --> 02:09:52.113]  Well, I'm rather reluctant to give.
[02:09:52.273 --> 02:10:03.520]  There's one particular country I think is a good one, and there are two others, but I'd rather not give them out on the radio because what's going to happen is the government's going to start leaning on them.
[02:10:04.781 --> 02:10:17.797]  But I do know this, that you're right about Canada, they have made an agreement with the United States to return draft evaders, and I would think that New Zealand and Australia will do exactly the same thing.
[02:10:18.556 --> 02:10:24.962]  And so, that cuts it down, you know, those are the countries that most people think of immediately.
[02:10:25.402 --> 02:10:34.970]  The people can contact me, I'll tell them privately, but if I put it out over the air, they're going to be all over those countries, you know, trying to make an agreement with them.
[02:10:36.331 --> 02:10:40.275]  Well, I think they're already, I know the countries you're talking, I think they already are, Bob.
[02:10:41.897 --> 02:10:42.477]  Well, it may be.
[02:10:42.578 --> 02:10:54.226]  I haven't read anything on it yet, and I think they've been doing, you know, other things that I think are more important to them at the moment, but the longer it takes for them to try to get an agreement, the better it is.
[02:10:54.967 --> 02:10:55.607]  No, I agree with you.
[02:10:55.627 --> 02:10:56.488]  I agree with that point.
[02:10:57.809 --> 02:11:01.271]  I tell you, this is just... Now, again, you served in the military.
[02:11:01.932 --> 02:11:06.015]  A lot of people did, who are now against this, because this isn't our military, is it?
[02:11:07.396 --> 02:11:30.562]  No, and if you look at it in the perspective that not only have they pulled up our Reserve and National Guard forces and they have a small military, what has happened at the top of the military is that many of the people upon retirement or long before that, who were real professionals, have quit and joined mercenary armies.
[02:11:31.202 --> 02:11:36.703]  Also... And we've got thousands and thousands of people who are assisting our military
[02:11:37.418 --> 02:11:39.579]  And they have plausible deniability.
[02:11:40.679 --> 02:11:42.560]  They can really do what they want.
[02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:43.861]  Just like with the torture.
[02:11:45.361 --> 02:11:45.701]  Pardon me?
[02:11:45.841 --> 02:11:46.862]  Just like with the torture.
[02:11:47.602 --> 02:11:49.023]  Those are private contractors.
[02:11:49.043 --> 02:11:50.343]  There's no control over them.
[02:11:50.763 --> 02:11:57.186]  And so in that respect alone, we don't have the same set of even domestic circumstances that we had before.
[02:11:58.326 --> 02:12:02.908]  And so the military today is not what it was before.
[02:12:03.748 --> 02:12:04.869]  And of course,
[02:12:05.907 --> 02:12:10.690]  The wars that we've recently had are wars for profit, and it's very, very obvious.
[02:12:10.910 --> 02:12:14.852]  Well, also, Bob, there's a draft on right now.
[02:12:15.152 --> 02:12:20.575]  People who've signed up for three years, five years, ten years, for two plus years, they're not letting any of them leave.
[02:12:20.595 --> 02:12:21.976]  They're saying, no, you're not allowed to leave.
[02:12:22.196 --> 02:12:23.397]  Didn't you read the fine print?
[02:12:23.417 --> 02:12:24.237]  You have to stay.
[02:12:24.397 --> 02:12:26.238]  So it's no longer a volunteer military.
[02:12:27.959 --> 02:12:31.361]  That's exactly true, and they have done that before.
[02:12:32.368 --> 02:12:33.689]  During the Second World War.
[02:12:34.470 --> 02:12:37.713]  And they did it in 1959 with the US Air Force.
[02:12:39.114 --> 02:12:43.077]  But that only lasted, in 1955, only lasted perhaps about a year.
[02:12:43.097 --> 02:12:46.720]  I don't recollect, but it wasn't a long period of time.
[02:12:47.820 --> 02:12:51.543]  But, you know, I was involved in the military at that time, so I was aware of it.
[02:12:53.425 --> 02:12:53.985]  But you're right.
[02:12:54.546 --> 02:12:58.469]  They are experiencing involuntary servitude.
[02:13:00.925 --> 02:13:04.428]  Oh boy, which is a fancy word for slavery, boys and girls.
[02:13:05.789 --> 02:13:06.630]  Uh-huh.
[02:13:06.670 --> 02:13:08.672]  Let's take some calls here.
[02:13:09.052 --> 02:13:10.173]  Somebody's got to talk about it.
[02:13:10.514 --> 02:13:11.715]  But you know what, Bob, last point.
[02:13:11.735 --> 02:13:13.456]  I'll go to the calls, I promise, and quickly callers.
[02:13:13.997 --> 02:13:16.299]  I'll make a point and then we'll move to the next because we've got a lot of people here.
[02:13:16.359 --> 02:13:19.021]  But the denial, Bob.
[02:13:19.061 --> 02:13:19.902]  I mean, if people are going to
[02:13:20.606 --> 02:13:29.250]  To deny that they've got all these draft bills introduced, draft boards being set up now for eight months, Selective Service preparing to force women into it.
[02:13:29.530 --> 02:13:36.493]  This is all in the newspaper, and still the yuppies I know who've got children laugh at me and say, no, it isn't going to happen, you're making it up.
[02:13:36.713 --> 02:13:40.095]  I mean, why are they in denial on something that's public?
[02:13:40.995 --> 02:13:44.777]  Yeah, well, I think it's part of their personality, and it's always been that way.
[02:13:45.757 --> 02:13:49.459]  They are in denial, like I said, to the gentleman who previously called.
[02:13:50.223 --> 02:13:53.124]  Uh, it's intellectual.
[02:13:54.025 --> 02:13:57.707]  They can't accept the ability that they're facing.
[02:13:58.467 --> 02:14:04.470]  Their decent minds just can't understand that anybody or any group of people can be that evil.
[02:14:04.990 --> 02:14:06.811]  It's intellectual dishonesty.
[02:14:09.255 --> 02:14:21.152]  Well yeah, they do the mental trick, the gymnastics of, no, I'm in control of my life, I have power, everything I've been taught is true, don't tell me that the world's round, I say it's flat, shut up, I don't want to hear it!
[02:14:22.053 --> 02:14:24.857]  Yeah, until a bayonet goes in and I feel the sharp pain.
[02:14:26.756 --> 02:14:33.102]  Okay, former military intelligence, economist, preeminent researcher, Bob Chapman's our guest.
[02:14:33.122 --> 02:14:33.842]  Let's go to the calls.
[02:14:33.982 --> 02:14:34.743]  Bam, bam, bam.
[02:14:35.264 --> 02:14:36.845]  Kevin in Boston, you're on the air.
[02:14:36.885 --> 02:14:37.305]  Go ahead.
[02:14:37.726 --> 02:14:39.387]  Hello Alex, thank you for taking my calls.
[02:14:39.507 --> 02:14:43.110]  I've got a question for Mr. Chapman and two quick comments.
[02:14:44.178 --> 02:14:45.358]  First of all, I work in a school.
[02:14:45.398 --> 02:14:49.460]  I started down today with a lockdown with over 20 police officers and vehicles everywhere.
[02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:52.241]  That was a nice start to my day.
[02:14:52.981 --> 02:14:58.003]  Second quick comment is regarding the other Kevin that called in a couple of callers back.
[02:14:58.183 --> 02:15:00.344]  He's not tuned in and he doesn't get it.
[02:15:00.384 --> 02:15:04.526]  I'm a former self-described proud liberal, but I've woken the New World Order.
[02:15:04.566 --> 02:15:04.906]  He won't
[02:15:06.026 --> 02:15:18.589]  Wake up until he reads some more of your stuff, so don't scare him away, because he'll come to our side, he knows something's wrong, but he has to realize that there's no savior in the Hillary, you know, occult campaign either.
[02:15:18.929 --> 02:15:30.953]  My question for Bob Chapman is, I was interested in his reaction to some points made by Senator Tom Ferguson, a Maryland state senator, who posted an article about elite bankers pulling the plug on the U.S.
[02:15:30.973 --> 02:15:32.613]  economy and currency today.
[02:15:33.075 --> 02:15:46.258]  And some of the points that he made that I was wondering what Mr. Chapman concurred or not with was, you know, he notes that the Japanese Nikkei dropped 5% last night, that the SEC has changed their position.
[02:15:46.278 --> 02:15:53.220]  They're now saying they're going to remove the crash protection on derivatives, and that's a huge warning that they're about to pull the plug.
[02:15:53.580 --> 02:15:59.101]  He says that Wall Street insiders are quitting with the value of the stock exchange seat.
[02:15:59.481 --> 02:16:00.382]  Yeah, let me stop you.
[02:16:00.462 --> 02:16:01.902]  We have, in the last two years,
[02:16:02.877 --> 02:16:12.059]  What is it, 40 to 1, Bob, of CEOs pulling out money 40 times for every time they put money in, and now that's accelerating.
[02:16:12.079 --> 02:16:12.419]  Go ahead.
[02:16:13.640 --> 02:16:15.180]  Yeah, it's been going on for two years.
[02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:19.021]  And I think the point he's bringing up, I haven't read them as yet.
[02:16:19.561 --> 02:16:21.702]  I spend too much time on the radio.
[02:16:22.282 --> 02:16:26.503]  But if you take them one by one, I think we can address them.
[02:16:26.523 --> 02:16:26.563]  OK.
[02:16:31.727 --> 02:16:33.647]  First of all, I did report on that several weeks ago.
[02:16:33.687 --> 02:16:37.328]  And I think what they know is that on the New York Stock Exchange, they've had tremendous problems.
[02:16:37.348 --> 02:16:39.108]  And I think that what's happening here is that perhaps
[02:16:58.129 --> 02:16:59.549]  And I think this will happen.
[02:17:00.049 --> 02:17:02.270]  The specialist system is going to be ended.
[02:17:03.070 --> 02:17:06.331]  And that means everything will be done electronically.
[02:17:06.711 --> 02:17:11.012]  And that means that the seats will be worth far less than they were in the past.
[02:17:11.592 --> 02:17:15.753]  And incidentally, these specialists have had a license to steal for the last 230 years.
[02:17:15.773 --> 02:17:16.453]  That's not really funny.
[02:17:19.074 --> 02:17:20.476]  By the way, let me add something to this.
[02:17:21.256 --> 02:17:25.240]  You talk about prosecution, people hiring criminal lawyers in the White House.
[02:17:25.721 --> 02:17:32.808]  Grasso's facing criminal charges now for his $200 million activities leaving the New York Stock Exchange.
[02:17:32.868 --> 02:17:33.569]  Comments on that, Bob?
[02:17:35.203 --> 02:17:41.165]  Well, I don't see that they have any grounds for criminal, as far as what I can see so far.
[02:17:41.985 --> 02:17:45.226]  But they certainly have a basis for a civil.
[02:17:45.726 --> 02:17:51.707]  And of course, for Eliot Spitzer, it's a piece of cake, because no matter what he does, it's right, politically.
[02:17:52.728 --> 02:17:55.308]  Although, I must say that Spitzer's done a lot of good things.
[02:17:57.609 --> 02:18:02.010]  But anyway, the people who are running the exchange,
[02:18:02.853 --> 02:18:08.374]  The board were the ones that voted Mr. Grasso his salaries and bonuses, etc.
[02:18:09.214 --> 02:18:11.995]  And you've got to stop and think for a minute.
[02:18:12.035 --> 02:18:13.075]  That isn't normal.
[02:18:13.995 --> 02:18:19.236]  The amount of money that they gave him was way out of sync with what should have been given to him.
[02:18:19.616 --> 02:18:21.537]  And those people had to have known that.
[02:18:22.237 --> 02:18:27.678]  So, there has to be another reason why Grasso was being paid off.
[02:18:29.582 --> 02:18:30.862]  And I have my suspicions.
[02:18:31.162 --> 02:18:32.703]  Well, obviously to keep his mouth shut.
[02:18:34.443 --> 02:18:39.545]  Well, you know, he took two trips down to see the narco-terrorists in Colombia.
[02:18:39.905 --> 02:18:42.566]  Now, someone's got to tell me why.
[02:18:42.606 --> 02:18:46.867]  And I've been involved with the stock exchange business for 45 years.
[02:18:47.387 --> 02:18:52.189]  Why would Grasso be down there with narco-terrorists twice, not once?
[02:18:52.249 --> 02:18:53.149]  There's photos of them.
[02:18:53.169 --> 02:18:53.729]  Talking to them.
[02:18:53.789 --> 02:18:57.030]  I mean, what conceivably could they have in common?
[02:18:58.390 --> 02:18:59.911]  Well, there's money laundering.
[02:19:00.191 --> 02:19:00.471]  Right.
[02:19:00.851 --> 02:19:03.512]  This is what's behind the whole thing.
[02:19:03.532 --> 02:19:05.653]  So that's his payout?
[02:19:07.234 --> 02:19:08.515]  The mob's payout.
[02:19:10.295 --> 02:19:12.296]  And that's just supposition on my part.
[02:19:12.356 --> 02:19:13.797]  I'm backing into this thing.
[02:19:14.677 --> 02:19:16.258]  But that could be the reason.
[02:19:16.438 --> 02:19:24.902]  Well, I mean, notice... And the minute I get down there... You know, I... If you're seeing this conference room, I'm a little... I need to tell you more.
[02:19:25.979 --> 02:19:28.000]  I'll tell you what, Bob, your phone just started cutting out.
[02:19:28.020 --> 02:19:29.900]  We'll try to reconnect with you or see if that gets better.
[02:19:30.201 --> 02:19:31.741]  Thanks for the call, Kevin.
[02:19:32.221 --> 02:19:37.443]  We'll try to go, we'll get to Brian, John, Dylan, Joe, others when we get back.
[02:19:38.103 --> 02:19:39.244]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:19:39.284 --> 02:19:41.445]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[02:19:41.785 --> 02:19:42.305]  Stay with us.
[02:19:46.542 --> 02:19:48.143]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:19:48.283 --> 02:19:52.404]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:19:52.524 --> 02:19:55.405]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:19:55.485 --> 02:20:02.167]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:20:02.367 --> 02:20:05.369]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:20:05.589 --> 02:20:07.970]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:20:08.130 --> 02:20:18.256]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as actazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[02:20:18.456 --> 02:20:27.579]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum aren't extracted.
[02:20:27.719 --> 02:20:35.362]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:20:35.402 --> 02:20:35.702]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:20:35.742 --> 02:20:37.703]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:20:45.934 --> 02:20:52.158]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:20:52.618 --> 02:21:00.384]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:21:00.744 --> 02:21:08.569]  Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:21:08.889 --> 02:21:13.651]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:21:13.992 --> 02:21:18.674]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:21:19.214 --> 02:21:23.056]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:21:23.556 --> 02:21:24.577]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:24.637 --> 02:21:28.739]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:21:29.159 --> 02:21:33.541]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:21:34.062 --> 02:21:36.563]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:21:37.043 --> 02:21:39.624]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:40.945 --> 02:21:42.425]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:42.546 --> 02:21:48.188]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:21:48.968 --> 02:21:54.591]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[02:21:54.611 --> 02:21:55.391]  Supreme Court.
[02:21:56.151 --> 02:22:00.453]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in a 9-0 decision of the U.S.
[02:22:00.473 --> 02:22:04.015]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:10.363]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[02:22:11.124 --> 02:22:19.449]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:22:20.990 --> 02:22:22.751]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:22:22.771 --> 02:22:23.152]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:22:35.043 --> 02:22:35.623]  Call now.

[02:22:45.231 --> 02:22:47.573]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:22:47.833 --> 02:22:51.677]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:22:51.997 --> 02:22:52.818]  Read the labels.
[02:22:53.238 --> 02:22:57.382]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:22:57.582 --> 02:23:01.785]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:23:02.146 --> 02:23:07.030]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:23:07.410 --> 02:23:10.992]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:23:11.172 --> 02:23:16.515]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:23:16.795 --> 02:23:19.516]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:23:19.817 --> 02:23:20.717]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:23:21.017 --> 02:23:31.763]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[02:23:34.966 --> 02:23:36.146]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:23:36.207 --> 02:23:37.287]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:57.968 --> 02:24:07.091]  Get your pens and paper ready, because the next segment is the final segment with Bob Chapman, and he'll give you the toll-free number to get a pre-copy of his International Forecaster, the latest edition of it.
[02:24:08.351 --> 02:24:10.211]  Let's try to go to these calls as quickly as possible.
[02:24:10.292 --> 02:24:14.433]  Brian in Louisiana, thanks for holding her on the air worldwide, sir.
[02:24:15.033 --> 02:24:18.554]  All right, I'll try to make this quick, but I got a personal question for both of y'all.
[02:24:18.594 --> 02:24:22.455]  Y'all falling in at 49 years old, and if they try to draft you, what are you going to do?
[02:24:23.928 --> 02:24:46.307]  Well, I don't fall into the over 49 years of age and I'm not going to serve a New World Order merc torture army where the troops are forced to take deadly vaccines and breathe depleted uranium and Bush has announced they're going to slash the benefits of the troops and not even take care of them despite the fact that even Korean War and Vietnam vets who were promised lifetime health care for them and their families have now been told they get nothing!
[02:24:46.567 --> 02:24:47.668]  Bob Chapman comments.
[02:24:48.849 --> 02:24:49.950]  Well, were you covered at all?
[02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:53.541]  That was a mouthful, but you're absolutely right.
[02:24:53.861 --> 02:25:05.886]  And the worst part of it probably is the Veterans Administration and their cutbacks and all of these people who have been injured in working in the military and now they won't take care of them.
[02:25:06.487 --> 02:25:11.229]  They won't even, they let them on furlough, the troops from Louisiana or in Fort Hood, Texas.
[02:25:11.489 --> 02:25:16.291]  They told them, yeah, y'all can go home, y'all got a week furlough for the Fourth of July, but we ain't bringing you, we got no money to send you home.
[02:25:16.849 --> 02:25:22.013]  A couple of businesses around Lafayette and TV stations chipped in and they're going to try to send them back.
[02:25:22.373 --> 02:25:23.394]  See, Greyhound sent them back.
[02:25:23.454 --> 02:25:26.496]  I think that's totally a shame and disgusting.
[02:25:26.776 --> 02:25:37.044]  But there's a trillion, two hundred billion missing from the Pentagon and hundreds of billions of dollars of contracts for Halliburton and others.
[02:25:37.324 --> 02:25:40.947]  I mean, there's no money because there's a mass looting going on, Bob!
[02:25:41.847 --> 02:25:45.190]  Absolutely, and HUD's the same way and it's like the cookie jar.
[02:25:48.651 --> 02:25:49.271]  One more question.
[02:25:49.351 --> 02:26:02.899]  I know there's no safe or sure thing in this life of death, taxes, and judgment after you die, but as far as getting into gold, do you know, Alex, or do you know of anything in the Patriot Act?
[02:26:03.419 --> 02:26:07.342]  Who's to say that, of course, you've got to put your money somewhere, and I'd rather have it in gold.
[02:26:07.987 --> 02:26:12.468]  Who's to say they're not going to, in the Patriot Act, it doesn't say somewhere where if you don't go, you're done for?
[02:26:12.488 --> 02:26:20.629]  Well, sir, executive orders say they can take your life, take your labor, take your money, take your gold, take your children, take your car, take your husband, take your wife.
[02:26:20.689 --> 02:26:22.230]  I mean, yeah, there's no limit.
[02:26:22.490 --> 02:26:27.190]  Tyranny will stop where you start resisting it, as the Founding Fathers said.
[02:26:27.230 --> 02:26:28.251]  So, there's no end.
[02:26:28.311 --> 02:26:28.891]  Thanks for the call.
[02:26:29.691 --> 02:26:30.331]  I appreciate it.
[02:26:30.511 --> 02:26:33.312]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:26:33.352 --> 02:26:35.172]  Let's talk to John in Texas.
[02:26:35.192 --> 02:26:35.852]  John, go ahead.
[02:26:36.650 --> 02:26:39.492]  Alex, I feel like you're my brother, and Bob, I feel like you're my uncle.
[02:26:39.512 --> 02:26:43.574]  I love you guys, and I appreciate the efforts you do on my behalf.
[02:26:44.315 --> 02:26:47.777]  What I'd like to say is, earlier you had a guy talking about gun control.
[02:26:47.817 --> 02:26:56.262]  I remember the lady in England, when the livestock got sick and they were killing them all, she said, we didn't even have a shotgun to defend ourselves or defend our property.
[02:26:56.997 --> 02:26:58.058]  And that's the same thing here.
[02:26:58.078 --> 02:26:59.059]  Hey, it's real simple.
[02:26:59.139 --> 02:27:04.744]  A Roman slave 2,000 years ago couldn't own a gun, and a black slave 170 years ago couldn't own a gun.
[02:27:05.085 --> 02:27:06.486]  Hitler was for gun control.
[02:27:06.686 --> 02:27:08.368]  It isn't very hard to figure out, Bob.
[02:27:09.829 --> 02:27:11.691]  You're absolutely right.
[02:27:12.872 --> 02:27:17.617]  And once they come after them, you know you're going to have to use your assault weapons.
[02:27:18.097 --> 02:27:19.238]  One other comment, if I may.
[02:27:19.859 --> 02:27:21.080]  July the 4th is coming up.
[02:27:21.100 --> 02:27:22.201]  Does Bob see anything?
[02:27:22.776 --> 02:27:25.937]  In the way of military coup or any sources?
[02:27:26.298 --> 02:27:27.558]  Probably couldn't even talk about it.
[02:27:27.618 --> 02:27:28.419]  No, I don't.
[02:27:28.559 --> 02:27:28.919]  I haven't.
[02:27:29.179 --> 02:27:38.823]  I don't see anything but what we discussed earlier in the program and the CIA and the relationship with the Bush neocons.
[02:27:38.903 --> 02:27:44.826]  This could be a coup in the making with the exceedance of the powers behind the throne.
[02:27:45.466 --> 02:27:47.848]  And so something like that could happen this summer.
[02:27:48.448 --> 02:27:50.829]  It could happen over the Fourth of July.
[02:27:51.451 --> 02:27:51.811]  Thank you.
[02:27:52.312 --> 02:27:52.692]  Thank you.
[02:27:52.712 --> 02:27:54.314]  We're in very dangerous waters, folks.
[02:27:54.454 --> 02:27:55.535]  All of this is very dangerous.
[02:27:56.936 --> 02:27:59.318]  Like Bob said, we don't know exactly what's going to happen, but it's bad.
[02:28:00.179 --> 02:28:00.959]  Dylan in Texas.
[02:28:00.999 --> 02:28:01.720]  Dylan, go ahead.
[02:28:02.541 --> 02:28:03.762]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:28:04.442 --> 02:28:07.845]  Thanks for being on Alex's show, Mr. Chapman.
[02:28:08.126 --> 02:28:09.647]  I really appreciate your input.
[02:28:10.808 --> 02:28:18.135]  As regards to that gentleman that called back, a few callers back, identified himself as
[02:28:19.745 --> 02:28:45.764]  uh... left wing or whatever uh... are you five years ago i was staunch uh... pro-choice as they call it but i'll tell you what i never in this world possibly ever believed in gun control there's some kind of fine line that's all i have to say okay thank you for the call uh... let's talk to joe joe in montana go ahead
[02:28:46.303 --> 02:28:48.904]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:28:49.844 --> 02:28:53.325]  Kevin's getting a lot of rhetoric here, and he should.
[02:28:53.965 --> 02:29:11.310]  I called to address the fact that if you're a true lover of truth and a real conservative in what I term the old conservative true values that love what America was founded on, you can never align yourself with people like Kevin and their agendas.
[02:29:11.350 --> 02:29:14.211]  They will exploit you to their own agendas if you do.
[02:29:14.890 --> 02:29:17.211]  And they will take away your rights, ultimately.
[02:29:17.291 --> 02:29:18.132]  That's what will happen.
[02:29:18.212 --> 02:29:21.254]  You can never align yourself with people like that.
[02:29:22.735 --> 02:29:24.936]  Well, you know, that's what I was trying to explain to him.
[02:29:24.976 --> 02:29:26.677]  I tell you what, stay there, Joe.
[02:29:26.697 --> 02:29:29.339]  We'll go to you and a few others, and we'll cover some news with Bob Chapman.
[02:29:29.839 --> 02:29:30.339]  Stay with us.
[02:29:30.379 --> 02:29:31.040]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:31.060 --> 02:29:33.941]  And again, the website's PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:29:36.543 --> 02:29:37.504]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.944 --> 02:29:39.545]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:39.565 --> 02:29:43.127]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:46.300 --> 02:29:50.003]  The grass is always greener with a wheatgrass kit from wheatgrasskits.com.

[02:29:53.786 --> 02:29:55.847]  Skip the high prices at the neighborhood juice bar.
[02:29:56.007 --> 02:30:01.311]  Grow your own wheatgrass, barley grass, sunflower greens, sprouts, or herbs for only pennies a day.
[02:30:01.532 --> 02:30:03.413]  It's easy to do indoors or out.
[02:30:03.673 --> 02:30:05.074]  Start with a basic wheatgrass kit.
[02:30:05.274 --> 02:30:08.677]  It's everything you'll need to grow stamina-building, nutrient-rich wheatgrass.
[02:30:08.957 --> 02:30:17.123]  The kit includes five pounds of organic wheatgrass seed, reusable growing trays, organic soil, mineral additive, and the book, Wheatgrass, Nature's Finest Miracle.
[02:30:17.343 --> 02:30:20.746]  Or get the deluxe kit that adds barley, grass seed, and sunflower greens.
[02:30:21.006 --> 02:30:25.910]  The health benefits of wheatgrass are legendary, but perhaps one of the best benefits are the antioxidants.
[02:30:26.190 --> 02:30:29.612]  Research is showing that antioxidants are instrumental in preventing cancer.
[02:30:29.872 --> 02:30:34.834]  At wheatgrasskits.com you'll find the best available price on a huge variety of wheatgrass juicers.
[02:30:34.974 --> 02:30:38.095]  And if you do find a better price, wheatgrasskits.com will beat it.
[02:30:38.295 --> 02:30:42.277]  Visit today, www.wheatgrasskits.com or call 801-375-2250.
[02:30:46.237 --> 02:30:50.839]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[02:30:51.059 --> 02:30:55.501]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.

[02:31:40.137 --> 02:31:41.318]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:31:46.204 --> 02:31:47.204]  It's finally here!
[02:31:47.344 --> 02:31:48.325]  Spring has arrived!
[02:31:48.505 --> 02:31:51.465]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:31:51.685 --> 02:31:55.146]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:31:55.366 --> 02:32:03.508]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[02:32:03.768 --> 02:32:07.509]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[02:32:07.709 --> 02:32:12.730]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[02:32:12.930 --> 02:32:17.514]  The Arcs Big 40 Packet Collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.

[02:32:47.276 --> 02:32:52.399]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:32:53.079 --> 02:32:55.341]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:32:58.782 --> 02:33:11.771]  All over the country, Homeland Security is announcing, hey, those traffic cameras, those cameras in your neighborhoods, oh, the Feds paid for those, and we're going to use those to watch you and face scan you.
[02:33:11.831 --> 02:33:14.933]  This is the new freedom, the most surveilled society in history.
[02:33:15.954 --> 02:33:17.295]  But nothing on the borders, of course.
[02:33:18.055 --> 02:33:19.496]  Again, it has nothing to do with terrorism.
[02:33:19.996 --> 02:33:21.737]  We'll take a few final calls here.
[02:33:22.078 --> 02:33:23.419]  I'll let Joe finish up.
[02:33:24.702 --> 02:33:26.583]  And Charles and another Joe.
[02:33:26.964 --> 02:33:29.085]  And then I'm going to get into some other news with Bob Chapman.
[02:33:29.105 --> 02:33:33.548]  In a minute or so, we'll give you Bob's toll-free number to get a free copy of International Forecaster.
[02:33:34.049 --> 02:33:40.633]  But before we do that, again, everybody's been hearing about Michael Moore and his new film, Fahrenheit 9-11.
[02:33:40.874 --> 02:33:43.215]  And I just love this trailer.
[02:33:43.235 --> 02:33:44.296]  I have to admit, I like the trailer.
[02:33:45.317 --> 02:33:47.098]  So I tell you what, Stephanie, get that trailer ready.
[02:33:47.118 --> 02:33:48.159]  I want to play that one more time.
[02:33:50.228 --> 02:33:53.871]  But, you know, the New York Post said, oh, Michael Moore ripped Alex Jones off.
[02:33:54.311 --> 02:33:55.332]  I don't really think that.
[02:33:55.632 --> 02:34:01.777]  I mean, certainly we know Moore's seen the film and all of that, but, you know, it's a public thing that happened with 9-11.
[02:34:01.977 --> 02:34:05.860]  But, what Moore says is, oh, see, the left's going to save us and the UN's good.
[02:34:06.160 --> 02:34:07.501]  It's all owned by the same people.
[02:34:07.961 --> 02:34:15.747]  My films go the step further and expose the whole New World Order, other terrorist events, Bill Clinton in Oklahoma City,
[02:34:17.210 --> 02:34:25.719]  If you want the big picture in professionally produced videos, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, those are my two films on 9-11, incredible works.
[02:34:26.199 --> 02:34:27.080]  You need to have them.
[02:34:27.661 --> 02:34:30.324]  Hundreds of smoking guns, of evidence in each video.
[02:34:30.384 --> 02:34:37.471]  My book, 9-11, Descent into Tyranny, 224 pages long, 1195, full of diagrams, documents, photos.
[02:34:37.871 --> 02:34:38.492]  It's amazing.
[02:34:39.353 --> 02:34:40.374]  It'll give you the big picture.
[02:34:41.055 --> 02:34:43.977]  Other videos I carry by other great authors and researchers.
[02:34:44.478 --> 02:34:47.740]  Jews, The Preservation of Firearm Ownership's new film.
[02:34:48.101 --> 02:34:49.542]  It's Discovery Channel quality.
[02:34:49.962 --> 02:34:50.943]  Innocence Portrayed.
[02:34:50.963 --> 02:34:54.606]  180 million people killed after they had their guns taken from them.
[02:34:54.646 --> 02:34:55.687]  We offer that video.
[02:34:55.947 --> 02:35:00.551]  It comes with three free booklets on the Second Amendment that are in comic book form.
[02:35:00.571 --> 02:35:01.752]  A great way to inform people.
[02:35:02.310 --> 02:35:10.545]  Go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com to order the videos via our safe, secure shopping cart.
[02:35:11.585 --> 02:35:20.368]  Infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or send $25.95 per video, unless you order three or more, then they drop down to $20 a piece.
[02:35:20.468 --> 02:35:21.388]  That's a big discount.
[02:35:21.408 --> 02:35:23.569]  $18 discount on the three-tape special.
[02:35:23.929 --> 02:35:27.010]  Write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.

[02:35:28.691 --> 02:35:30.671]  Operators are there right now.
[02:35:38.114 --> 02:35:38.754]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:35:44.417 --> 02:35:48.879]  But here's that two-minute trailer from Fahrenheit 9-11.
[02:35:49.379 --> 02:35:51.120]  And again, my film covers this as well.
[02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:53.721]  Police State 3 Total Enslavement gets into the Iraq War.
[02:35:53.761 --> 02:35:56.603]  But you need to get my videos.
[02:35:56.823 --> 02:36:00.484]  But here's Moore's trailer for Fahrenheit 9-11 coming out in two weeks.
[02:36:00.524 --> 02:36:01.045]  Go ahead and hit it.
[02:36:01.545 --> 02:36:03.566]  You can make people do anything if they're afraid.
[02:36:05.919 --> 02:36:12.501]  The FAA has taken the action to close all of the airports in the United States.
[02:36:12.621 --> 02:36:14.841]  All commercial and airline traffic was grounded.
[02:36:15.121 --> 02:36:22.223]  But we had some airplanes authorized at the highest levels of our government to pick up Osama Bin Laden's family members and transport them out of this country.
[02:36:22.323 --> 02:36:28.784]  In the middle of the war, corporations decided to hold a conference to figure out how much money could be made.
[02:36:30.115 --> 02:36:32.519]  Once that oil starts flowing, it's gonna be lots of money.
[02:36:32.779 --> 02:36:34.321]  Whatever it costs, the government will pay you.
[02:36:34.562 --> 02:36:37.886]  It's gonna be good for business, bad for the people.
[02:36:37.906 --> 02:36:45.858]  Congressman, trying to get numbers of Congress to get their kids to enlist in the Army and go over to Iraq.
[02:36:47.990 --> 02:36:52.112]  The USA Patriot Act allows for searches of medical and financial records.
[02:36:52.572 --> 02:36:54.773]  It gives law enforcement almost unlimited power.
[02:36:55.213 --> 02:36:56.553]  They wait till the middle of the night.
[02:36:56.673 --> 02:36:58.314]  It's printed in the middle of the night.
[02:36:58.394 --> 02:37:02.515]  How could Congress pass this Patriot Act without even reading it?
[02:37:02.616 --> 02:37:03.616]  Sit down, my friend.
[02:37:04.830 --> 02:37:07.891]  Uh, we don't read most of the bills.
[02:37:08.211 --> 02:37:09.391]  No one read it!
[02:37:09.451 --> 02:37:12.832]  Members of Congress, this is Michael Moore.
[02:37:13.172 --> 02:37:17.453]  I would like to read to you the U.S.A.
[02:37:17.573 --> 02:37:20.554]  Patriot Act.
[02:37:20.594 --> 02:37:23.735]  From the corridors of power... Congressman?
[02:37:23.795 --> 02:37:24.575]  I don't know.
[02:37:24.615 --> 02:37:25.235]  Congressman?
[02:37:25.635 --> 02:37:28.276]  To the streets of small-town America.
[02:37:29.336 --> 02:37:30.496]  To the front lines.
[02:37:32.257 --> 02:37:33.517]  Impressive crowd, the Habs.
[02:37:34.770 --> 02:37:35.430]  And they have more.
[02:37:35.850 --> 02:37:38.811]  Some people call you the elite.
[02:37:38.971 --> 02:37:40.331]  I call you my base.
[02:37:41.191 --> 02:37:51.333]  Comes the true story that will make your temperature rise.
[02:37:51.393 --> 02:37:56.654]  I call upon all nations to do everything they can to stop these terrorist killers.
[02:37:58.514 --> 02:38:00.274]  Thank you.
[02:38:00.294 --> 02:38:01.195]  Now watch this drive.
[02:38:07.370 --> 02:38:10.211]  Now again, why do you think this guy was given a national TV show?
[02:38:10.291 --> 02:38:11.492]  Why do you think he does all this?
[02:38:11.552 --> 02:38:19.676]  Because, again, the globalists can have the left expose the right side of the New World Order, the right can expose the left side of the New World Order, but the system keeps moving on.
[02:38:19.956 --> 02:38:22.897]  To neutralize their power, you've got to expose the whole system.
[02:38:23.297 --> 02:38:24.578]  And that's what my videos do.
[02:38:25.663 --> 02:38:27.065]  Again, you need to get them.
[02:38:27.185 --> 02:38:28.727]  You need to order the films.
[02:38:29.207 --> 02:38:30.189]  Back to Bob Chapman.
[02:38:31.150 --> 02:38:38.579]  Bob, how important is the false left-right system in keeping the population corralled to the point that they never find any real solutions?
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:43.444]  Well, it's called misdirection, and it's just circular in motion.
[02:38:44.410 --> 02:38:48.092]  And they just keep people confused all the time.
[02:38:48.112 --> 02:38:50.214]  And that's why a video like yours is so important.
[02:38:50.654 --> 02:38:52.975]  Particularly for the people who understand.
[02:38:52.995 --> 02:38:56.617]  They can pass that on to other people so that the truth can get out.
[02:38:58.478 --> 02:38:59.239]  It's up to us.
[02:38:59.499 --> 02:39:01.600]  We're about to go back and take a few final calls.
[02:39:01.620 --> 02:39:06.563]  We're about to let Joe and then Charles and another Joe and a Rick and that'll be it for calls.
[02:39:06.603 --> 02:39:07.243]  Sorry to the others.
[02:39:07.303 --> 02:39:10.105]  But how do folks get a free copy of International Forecaster?
[02:39:11.475 --> 02:39:13.116]  They can call toll free to 877-479-8178.
[02:39:13.136 --> 02:39:14.337]  And I'll repeat that.
[02:39:14.397 --> 02:39:14.717]  That's 877-479-8178.
[02:39:14.737 --> 02:39:19.560]  And at the same time, you've also got a website.
[02:39:19.620 --> 02:39:23.302]  Yes, and that is called TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:39:23.322 --> 02:39:24.562]  Forecaster is F-O-R-E.
[02:39:40.138 --> 02:39:43.321]  The International Forecaster dot com.
[02:39:43.341 --> 02:39:44.662]  A lot of powerful info.
[02:39:45.703 --> 02:39:54.911]  Joe, your point about how we were talking to Kevin earlier, and he just, not the last Kevin, but the Kevin before last, saying, you know, I'm for gun control, but I know there's this elite and all this.
[02:39:54.951 --> 02:39:56.152]  I mean, it's just so foolish.
[02:39:56.172 --> 02:39:57.673]  You were trying to finish up your point.
[02:39:57.713 --> 02:39:58.094]  Go ahead.
[02:39:58.614 --> 02:40:07.602]  Well, you know, I think they make a lot of ground, and I think, like their protest in Seattle and that, a lot of good, really true conservative people joined in that.
[02:40:08.577 --> 02:40:10.219]  And you're exploited when you do that.
[02:40:10.299 --> 02:40:12.901]  You have no common ground with these kind of people.
[02:40:12.941 --> 02:40:17.224]  You have none with the Bushites, and you have none with the leftist Kevins.
[02:40:17.745 --> 02:40:25.091]  And they'll make you think that they do, but when you join them, if you march with them or protest with them, you're being exploited.
[02:40:25.231 --> 02:40:29.014]  And their ultimate agenda is to destroy your rights.
[02:40:29.494 --> 02:40:37.761]  If you want to march, if you want to protest, you must do it yourself or put your own truly conservative, honest group together and do it.
[02:40:38.188 --> 02:40:42.931]  But never, never, never align yourself with those kind of people.
[02:40:44.091 --> 02:40:44.472]  All right.
[02:40:44.532 --> 02:40:48.934]  Well, I mean, I certainly agree with you that you cannot be compromised or sucked into that.
[02:40:49.094 --> 02:40:50.975]  I like to go in and deprogram these people.
[02:40:51.776 --> 02:40:53.917]  Well, I think you can do that, Alex.
[02:40:53.997 --> 02:41:03.322]  But I just feel bad to see what's going on today, that there are a lot of people who really don't like Bush and they're being exploited by the left now.
[02:41:03.362 --> 02:41:05.644]  And I think that's what Kevin's call is all about.
[02:41:05.684 --> 02:41:05.844]  Yeah.
[02:41:06.474 --> 02:41:07.534]  Thanks for the call.
[02:41:07.574 --> 02:41:09.215]  I appreciate it.
[02:41:09.335 --> 02:41:10.916]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:41:10.936 --> 02:41:16.418]  Let's talk to... I guess up next here is Charles in Rhode Island.
[02:41:16.438 --> 02:41:16.958]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:41:17.538 --> 02:41:18.279]  Hi, Alex.
[02:41:18.299 --> 02:41:18.719]  Mr. Chapman.
[02:41:19.259 --> 02:41:20.780]  Listen, I'm 53 years old.
[02:41:20.820 --> 02:41:22.761]  I'd like to tell you about my experience in the draft.
[02:41:23.381 --> 02:41:26.122]  I was drafted for three hours on September 12, 1971.
[02:41:27.162 --> 02:41:31.844]  I had three separate physicals and three separate psychologicals before my final physical that day.
[02:41:33.125 --> 02:41:36.046]  And the reason that they... I went right up to the point where
[02:41:36.704 --> 02:41:37.624]  They were going to swear me in.
[02:41:37.664 --> 02:41:44.827]  The reason that they pulled me to the side away from the group and told me that there was a problem with me.
[02:41:44.867 --> 02:41:45.688]  I said, what's the problem?
[02:41:46.068 --> 02:41:47.729]  They said, you don't have a social security number.
[02:41:48.069 --> 02:41:48.729]  I said, that's right.
[02:41:48.769 --> 02:41:49.949]  It's a voluntary program.
[02:41:50.290 --> 02:41:54.091]  My grandfather told me by the time I got to be his age, there wasn't going to be any money in there.
[02:41:54.331 --> 02:41:56.192]  The government would successfully steal it.
[02:41:56.232 --> 02:42:00.674]  So, you know, that was back in the days when you had to go voluntarily get a social security number.
[02:42:01.554 --> 02:42:05.756]  So basically, if you don't get the social security number, you can't be drafted is what I'm telling you.
[02:42:06.730 --> 02:42:08.251]  Wow, that's an interesting point, Bob.
[02:42:09.871 --> 02:42:10.832]  I heard that before.
[02:42:11.132 --> 02:42:12.512]  I haven't seen it tested.
[02:42:13.293 --> 02:42:18.175]  And there are an awful lot of people who write to me to tell me they don't have a number and they won't have a number.
[02:42:18.715 --> 02:42:22.596]  And they've gotten away with having their children without numbers also.
[02:42:23.557 --> 02:42:29.819]  Well, I basically told them that you guys got housing, you got clothing, and you got food.
[02:42:29.939 --> 02:42:30.740]  I'll work for nothing.
[02:42:30.760 --> 02:42:31.660]  I'll find my own money.
[02:42:32.139 --> 02:42:35.821]  And, uh, the sergeant walked in, got a captain, came back, came with a captain.
[02:42:36.161 --> 02:42:37.221]  I explained that to the captain.
[02:42:37.481 --> 02:42:41.183]  He said, you know, there's smoke coming out of their ears, as I'm telling this.
[02:42:41.483 --> 02:42:45.164]  And two weeks later, I got reclassified from 1A to 4F.
[02:42:45.905 --> 02:42:50.127]  And, uh, you know, I've existed, uh, my whole life to date with no social security number.
[02:42:50.147 --> 02:42:52.688]  You know, I'm in the, uh, junkyard business.
[02:42:52.728 --> 02:42:56.049]  So, you know, the government's not going to take over that business.
[02:42:56.089 --> 02:42:56.529]  Uh, yeah.
[02:42:56.949 --> 02:42:58.070]  So basically,
[02:42:59.023 --> 02:43:12.146]  That's what you've got to do, is you've got to focus on the fact that the Social Security number is a voluntary program, that all these children have been issued the number from birth, which is against the basic common sense.
[02:43:12.166 --> 02:43:22.968]  Well, it is their slave identification number, and they said that, oh, it's just for the program, and there's a law they're not supposed to use it as a personal ID, but then they'll demand it from you.
[02:43:22.988 --> 02:43:23.608]  Thanks for the call.
[02:43:25.038 --> 02:43:29.962]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Maryland, where Homeland Security is taking control of all the cameras.
[02:43:30.022 --> 02:43:30.683]  Go ahead, Joe.
[02:43:31.343 --> 02:43:32.905]  Hey Alex, I love your show, man.
[02:43:32.945 --> 02:43:35.727]  I got turned on to your website from the Sacred Cow site.
[02:43:36.067 --> 02:43:36.808]  Alright, welcome.
[02:43:37.468 --> 02:43:40.091]  Yeah, and I can't wait for the drug war documentary either.
[02:43:40.551 --> 02:43:49.538]  But, I wanted to say, this morning after the... Your phone's cutting out, sir.
[02:43:49.558 --> 02:43:51.220]  Alright, can you hear me now?
[02:43:51.920 --> 02:43:52.741]  Are you on a cordless?
[02:43:53.550 --> 02:43:54.030]  No, sir.
[02:43:54.830 --> 02:43:56.391]  I just want to make this quick point.
[02:43:57.231 --> 02:44:07.853]  On this radio show, they were discussing how many cameras are going to come into Baltimore, and it actually wanted callers to call in and pick good areas for cameras where they think the highest crime is.
[02:44:08.113 --> 02:44:11.834]  And that's the Delphi method to make people feel like they're part of the power process.
[02:44:12.034 --> 02:44:15.295]  This is WBAL, and that's why I figured you were calling about this.
[02:44:15.355 --> 02:44:15.975]  I just guessed it.
[02:44:16.415 --> 02:44:20.016]  WBAL-TV, Baltimore set for 24-hour Homeland Security surveillance.
[02:44:20.683 --> 02:44:24.604]  Local and state homeland security authorities are beginning to build a regional network.
[02:44:25.064 --> 02:44:27.405]  New York's going to spend a billion dollars on it.
[02:44:28.105 --> 02:44:31.366]  Of 24-hour surveillance cameras that will go live this summer in Baltimore.
[02:44:31.386 --> 02:44:32.087]  They're already live.
[02:44:32.107 --> 02:44:34.067]  And expand through the area.
[02:44:34.107 --> 02:44:39.869]  The closed-circuit video surveillance system of public areas will begin in the Inner Harbor by the end of the summer.
[02:44:40.615 --> 02:44:42.736]  Well, I think it's something that's been evolving.
[02:44:42.756 --> 02:44:43.457]  I know that in England
[02:45:04.967 --> 02:45:05.408]  I don't know.
[02:45:21.445 --> 02:45:22.346]  The United Kingdom.
[02:45:22.386 --> 02:45:31.753]  So I would think, along with the visual spying, as we call it, you can expect they're going to try to introduce a card also.
[02:45:32.133 --> 02:45:35.756]  Well, on top of that, we already have a national ID card by fiat.
[02:45:36.056 --> 02:45:41.220]  And a few months ago, the Supreme Court said, if you're walking down the street or on your own property, you've got to show them an ID.
[02:45:41.620 --> 02:45:42.981]  You've got to answer their questions.
[02:45:43.062 --> 02:45:44.202]  So there goes the Fifth Amendment.
[02:45:45.003 --> 02:45:45.463]  That's right.
[02:45:46.364 --> 02:45:46.884]  Just amazing.
[02:45:46.904 --> 02:45:47.905]  It's part of the Patriot Act.
[02:45:48.566 --> 02:45:49.707]  Anything else, Joe?
[02:45:50.734 --> 02:45:57.660]  Well, no, I just thought it was really interesting how they wanted the audience participation to discuss good areas.
[02:45:57.680 --> 02:45:59.982]  They were talking about these crimes that have happened in the past.
[02:46:00.062 --> 02:46:02.664]  Oh, they could have been averted, you know, via the cameras.
[02:46:03.351 --> 02:46:04.672]  It's just, it's amazing.
[02:46:04.712 --> 02:46:08.375]  And now Homeland Security says they're going to fight terror and crime.
[02:46:08.735 --> 02:46:15.161]  Because crime-age terrorists, so we all don't have our liberties under criminal investigations, because crime is terror.
[02:46:15.541 --> 02:46:17.403]  Section 802 of H.R.
[02:46:17.423 --> 02:46:20.245]  3162, known as the USA Patriot Act, passed October 27, 2001.
[02:46:20.305 --> 02:46:21.326]  Thanks for the call.
[02:46:23.454 --> 02:46:25.436]  One last call, and then that's going to be it.
[02:46:25.476 --> 02:46:29.300]  We're going to finish up with our great guest, Mike in Honolulu, Hawaii.
[02:46:29.340 --> 02:46:29.800]  Go ahead.
[02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:30.921]  Hey, aloha, Alex.
[02:46:31.001 --> 02:46:37.267]  Real quick, I was going to ask your guest, what is his analysis on the mood of the military?
[02:46:37.387 --> 02:46:44.214]  You know, some people say, yeah, the military is getting upset, and they're going to maybe do a coup, and others say, no, that could never happen.
[02:46:44.294 --> 02:46:47.377]  I'd like to hear what Robert thinks of the status of the military.
[02:46:48.652 --> 02:46:55.194]  Well, I think Don Grande covered that fully here on this program some time ago.
[02:46:56.075 --> 02:46:57.615]  And I've been recommending his book.
[02:46:58.335 --> 02:47:02.837]  But I think that possibility strongly exists.
[02:47:03.657 --> 02:47:10.200]  And I think there is a group within the military, if things go too far, that they might just do that.
[02:47:11.220 --> 02:47:14.041]  And it could be the only thing that could save us.
[02:47:14.921 --> 02:47:16.882]  And that is a distinct possibility.
[02:47:18.160 --> 02:47:18.881]  Very good, thanks.
[02:47:19.661 --> 02:47:26.446]  I appreciate it, but also it could be the higher-up globalists using that as a way to bring in the military dictatorship.
[02:47:27.606 --> 02:47:30.648]  Again, you won't know until it happens, and you're going to have to guess.
[02:47:31.469 --> 02:47:33.490]  But bottom line, it's all very dangerous, folks.
[02:47:34.171 --> 02:47:37.013]  Alright, thank you for the call from Hawaii.
[02:47:38.393 --> 02:47:40.755]  Bob Chapman, we've got a few minutes left here.
[02:47:41.095 --> 02:47:43.517]  I've got some news I wanted to go over with you, but
[02:47:45.163 --> 02:47:49.844]  The troops have died by the thousands now, 900 in Iraq, more than that in Afghanistan.
[02:47:49.864 --> 02:47:52.865]  They're trying to cover up those numbers, but those are now out there.
[02:47:53.465 --> 02:47:56.165]  The neocons say they're going to hit 60 plus other countries.
[02:47:56.605 --> 02:48:03.227]  Is that program stalled, or will they just carry out another terror attack to get the people behind these invasions of other nations?
[02:48:04.807 --> 02:48:14.669]  Well, I think on the figures, they're not counting the mercenaries, and they've lost as many people as the military has, so you can double those figures.
[02:48:15.878 --> 02:48:33.489]  As far as the program and whether they're going to continue this perpetual war for perpetual peace thing, it all depends on how things come down with Bush and the investigation and the evolution of whether they attempt to impeach him or not.
[02:48:34.449 --> 02:48:35.990]  Again, it's really up in the air.
[02:48:36.010 --> 02:48:38.332]  If Bush stays in, we'll continue.
[02:48:39.306 --> 02:48:41.327]  To get the program that we've been getting.
[02:48:41.768 --> 02:48:44.850]  If he goes out, we may get the same program.
[02:48:45.270 --> 02:48:48.773]  It depends upon who goes into office.
[02:48:49.133 --> 02:48:51.094]  There's just so many ifs in here.
[02:48:51.534 --> 02:49:00.420]  We have six months here, or five months actually, of confusion, even for those of us who are in the intelligence business.
[02:49:02.662 --> 02:49:06.865]  Boy, I tell ya, it is an interesting time to be alive, as the Chinese say.
[02:49:07.990 --> 02:49:15.575]  A blessing and a curse at the same time, but doing radio interviews, talking to people on your website, traveling around the globe.
[02:49:15.695 --> 02:49:19.318]  Bob, are you seeing the same huge awakening that I'm witnessing?
[02:49:21.419 --> 02:49:27.003]  Yes, I am, and I'm seeing it coming more from the left than anything else.
[02:49:27.023 --> 02:49:36.569]  In fact, almost half of the inquiries that I get are from people who identify themselves as liberals or people who are left of center politically.
[02:49:37.447 --> 02:49:47.810]  And I think that's really good, like the gentleman from Boston said, you know, don't steer them away, let them learn and understand and come in our direction.
[02:49:49.191 --> 02:49:49.831]  Very important.
[02:49:50.291 --> 02:49:51.011]  Well, exactly.
[02:49:51.171 --> 02:50:00.935]  I'm not going to be co-opted, and I'm not trying to co-opt them, but I want them to wake up and stop being so naive and realize that their whole leftist worldview was created by the same people that run Bush.
[02:50:01.815 --> 02:50:03.796]  And they better... And I'm trying to get into their head.
[02:50:03.896 --> 02:50:04.996]  It really is difficult.
[02:50:07.239 --> 02:50:08.120]  I mean, it's a scam.
[02:50:08.160 --> 02:50:09.461]  It's a rigged game, folks.
[02:50:09.501 --> 02:50:11.762]  This is for big stakes.
[02:50:11.822 --> 02:50:12.983]  This is for the whole globe.
[02:50:13.904 --> 02:50:17.786]  And the globalists infiltrate, try to infiltrate, anything of any real size.
[02:50:18.306 --> 02:50:20.448]  And your Democrats, I mean, are all voting with Bush.
[02:50:20.508 --> 02:50:21.509]  Just the rhetoric's different.
[02:50:21.809 --> 02:50:27.012]  Bob Chapman, I want to thank you for coming on the broadcast and look forward to having you back on in the near future, my friend.
[02:50:27.673 --> 02:50:28.753]  Well, thank you very much.
[02:50:28.793 --> 02:50:30.395]  You've got a wonderful program, Alex.
[02:50:31.155 --> 02:50:31.896]  Well, thank you, Bob.
[02:50:31.916 --> 02:50:32.296]  Take care.
[02:50:33.176 --> 02:50:34.437]  Alright, final segment straight ahead.
[02:50:34.477 --> 02:50:36.719]  I'm going to hit a few final news articles here.
[02:50:37.719 --> 02:50:40.262]  Gotta tell you where I think things are going, through this fog.
[02:50:40.282 --> 02:50:42.644]  And we shall return.
[02:50:42.704 --> 02:50:43.365]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:50:46.408 --> 02:50:53.255]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:50:53.556 --> 02:50:54.937]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:50:55.117 --> 02:50:57.320]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:50:57.480 --> 02:50:59.562]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:50:59.842 --> 02:51:04.787]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:51:05.108 --> 02:51:09.132]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:51:09.392 --> 02:51:11.173]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:51:11.253 --> 02:51:21.899]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[02:51:22.040 --> 02:51:23.941]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:51:24.141 --> 02:51:28.023]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns of the info war.
[02:51:28.103 --> 02:51:29.324]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533139.
[02:51:29.524 --> 02:51:29.744]  That's 888-2533139.
[02:51:36.468 --> 02:51:40.197]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[02:51:40.457 --> 02:51:41.179]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[02:51:45.589 --> 02:51:48.590]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:51:48.910 --> 02:51:53.832]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:51:54.092 --> 02:51:58.453]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:51:58.734 --> 02:52:07.657]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:52:07.857 --> 02:52:11.478]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:52:11.778 --> 02:52:16.806]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:52:17.106 --> 02:52:23.857]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:52:24.338 --> 02:52:24.878]  What about you?
[02:52:25.615 --> 02:52:30.979]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:52:46.713 --> 02:52:47.054]  I think so.
[02:53:01.957 --> 02:53:02.618]  We're good to go!
[02:53:31.477 --> 02:53:34.579]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:53:34.739 --> 02:53:40.603]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:53:52.794 --> 02:53:58.977]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest, a gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[02:53:59.417 --> 02:54:03.399]  Monday through Friday at 11 a.m.
[02:54:03.519 --> 02:54:04.460]  to 2 p.m.
[02:54:04.660 --> 02:54:05.621]  Central Standard Time.
[02:54:05.661 --> 02:54:07.061]  Back from 9 to midnight Central.
[02:54:08.102 --> 02:54:09.042]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:54:09.082 --> 02:54:12.884]  Please tell your friends, your family, your neighbors about the broadcast.
[02:54:14.825 --> 02:54:16.026]  We're fighting slavery.
[02:54:16.086 --> 02:54:17.066]  Forget left, right.
[02:54:17.106 --> 02:54:18.367]  We're fighting slavery.
[02:54:19.346 --> 02:54:28.393]  And if you have a big government that violates your rights, no matter who's in office, you're going to have despotism, tyranny, serfdom, enslavement.
[02:54:30.154 --> 02:54:33.797]  And I'm very suspicious about any discussion of military coups.
[02:54:35.017 --> 02:54:37.379]  The military's all a bunch of CFR at the top.
[02:54:37.399 --> 02:54:40.822]  A lot of well-meaning people throughout the main body, though.
[02:54:41.942 --> 02:54:44.084]  And I see this coming from so many different quarters.
[02:54:44.985 --> 02:54:48.287]  If the globalists do pull something like that, it's just to put in a UN government.
[02:54:51.968 --> 02:54:55.590]  Bush is a puppet, Cheney is a puppet, they're all puppets of the larger financial interests.
[02:54:55.610 --> 02:54:59.593]  They would love, though, to burn them politically and say, oh, they did all this.
[02:54:59.653 --> 02:55:00.634]  They took over Iraq.
[02:55:00.694 --> 02:55:02.074]  They did all this evil militarism.
[02:55:02.375 --> 02:55:03.055]  See, the U.N.'
[02:55:03.035 --> 02:55:04.416]  's going to be the answer to the problems.
[02:55:04.456 --> 02:55:05.156]  They're going to save us.
[02:55:05.417 --> 02:55:13.622]  And suddenly you'll see the so-called left, the leaders of it, shift and go, oh yeah, the new ruler's good, secret arrest is good, and it's of the evil right-wingers.
[02:55:15.883 --> 02:55:16.984]  So, I mean,
[02:55:18.544 --> 02:55:26.489]  I don't think the globalists know exactly what they're going to do right now, because a lot of things haven't gone according to plan, and there is an awakening taking place, and they know that's happening.
[02:55:26.849 --> 02:55:28.430]  So they have to question the quandary.
[02:55:30.031 --> 02:55:36.174]  As you say, the Hobson's Choice, you know, should they go ahead with more terror attacks to scare us into submission?
[02:55:36.234 --> 02:55:37.095]  Will we buy that?
[02:55:37.395 --> 02:55:38.796]  Will that cause more resistance?
[02:55:40.626 --> 02:55:42.307]  Have they bitten off more than they can chew?
[02:55:42.387 --> 02:55:43.407]  Should they back off?
[02:55:43.887 --> 02:55:45.508]  And just let the status quo continue?
[02:55:46.048 --> 02:55:49.330]  The point is, they're putting in this massive control grid all around us.
[02:55:49.890 --> 02:55:55.072]  They're training us that secret arrest and torture and military on the streets is a good thing.
[02:55:55.352 --> 02:55:57.253]  They're telling us martial law is a good thing.
[02:55:57.313 --> 02:55:58.454]  Big Brother's here to help.
[02:55:58.874 --> 02:56:00.475]  All the definitions are being changed.
[02:56:00.735 --> 02:56:02.616]  Our free society's being erased.
[02:56:02.956 --> 02:56:10.139]  And Democrats and Republicans together, greedily, at the international, federal, state, local level, are working together to do it.
[02:56:11.744 --> 02:56:14.245]  So we better make freedom the number one issue.
[02:56:14.746 --> 02:56:15.686]  And look at our liberties.
[02:56:15.786 --> 02:56:17.267]  And look at how they're being dismantled.
[02:56:17.487 --> 02:56:19.408]  And tell the government, we're not your property.
[02:56:19.628 --> 02:56:21.589]  We're not going to go along with your unjust laws.
[02:56:21.809 --> 02:56:23.550]  We're not going to sanction your criminality.
[02:56:23.750 --> 02:56:27.712]  How dare Bush's people come out and say, he's allowed to torture, he's above the law.
[02:56:29.505 --> 02:56:41.054]  Then I look at this article out of MSNBC like it's a good thing that country radio stations won't play all these big artists if they're anti-war or even slightly asking questions.
[02:56:41.094 --> 02:56:49.941]  We're talking about Willie Nelson, which they still air, Toby Keith, you know, and Darryl Worley and people like that, Charlie Daniels, all love the war.
[02:56:51.082 --> 02:56:53.644]  But they get played ad nauseam.
[02:56:53.944 --> 02:56:57.967]  But Merle Haggard and Nancy Griffin and Willie Nelson and others,
[02:56:59.867 --> 02:57:02.352]  People want to hear those songs, but they're not airing it.
[02:57:02.392 --> 02:57:11.249]  I mean, that's Nazism, folks, to say, oh, we're not going to play... Right after 9-11, they wouldn't play songs that talked about peace.
[02:57:12.233 --> 02:57:12.813]  Or love.
[02:57:13.114 --> 02:57:14.534]  I mean, it's crafting.
[02:57:14.594 --> 02:57:16.195]  It's manipulation of our minds.
[02:57:16.455 --> 02:57:16.936]  Look at this.
[02:57:17.216 --> 02:57:17.876]  ABC News.
[02:57:18.436 --> 02:57:21.458]  G8 seeks to help create world peacekeeper force.
[02:57:21.598 --> 02:57:23.779]  I mean, world imperial force.
[02:57:24.079 --> 02:57:28.862]  That's what the G8 industrialized nations met under martial law in Georgia to set up yesterday.
[02:57:28.882 --> 02:57:29.482]  Another one.
[02:57:29.502 --> 02:57:33.824]  G8 approves tighter airport security for all air travel worldwide.
[02:57:33.844 --> 02:57:34.045]  See?
[02:57:34.345 --> 02:57:35.425]  Global biometrics.
[02:57:35.465 --> 02:57:36.526]  Global ID cards.
[02:57:39.306 --> 02:57:39.867]  It's amazing.
[02:57:39.887 --> 02:57:42.969]  They've caught the EU cheating in elections over in the Euro.
[02:57:43.810 --> 02:57:50.775]  Bush's approval ratings are plunging now to almost below 40%, which is very scary because that's when they like to carry out terror attacks.
[02:57:51.155 --> 02:57:54.398]  Voters shift in favor of Kerry, thinking the false choice will save them.
[02:57:55.719 --> 02:58:01.343]  Meanwhile, CNN reports cigars cost men three years in prison trying to smuggle in Cuban cigars.
[02:58:01.403 --> 02:58:02.484]  I mean, that should not be illegal.
[02:58:03.124 --> 02:58:05.146]  Court upholds Bible class ban.
[02:58:06.835 --> 02:58:10.877]  And I can't even have it as a piece of literature in the public schools, but you can have all the other occult stuff.
[02:58:12.838 --> 02:58:13.538]  We're out of time.
[02:58:13.558 --> 02:58:16.320]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, on your local AM or FM station.
[02:58:16.340 --> 02:58:19.181]  I want to thank them, the sponsors, the listeners, the folks running the broadcast.
[02:58:20.081 --> 02:58:22.943]  Also, on the global shortwave at night, you can hear us from 9 to midnight at 3210.
[02:58:24.503 --> 02:58:26.564]  During the day, from 11 to 2 central at 9475.
[02:58:26.745 --> 02:58:31.807]  And as always, at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:58:32.287 --> 02:58:33.748]  Now get out there and take on tyranny.
[02:58:33.988 --> 02:58:34.948]  Don't be their slaves.
[02:58:35.009 --> 02:58:35.789]  Don't lick their boots.
[02:58:36.872 --> 02:58:47.605]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:58:47.786 --> 02:58:55.355]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:58:55.595 --> 02:58:58.760]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:58:59.020 --> 02:59:04.788]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:59:05.048 --> 02:59:11.197]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:59:11.557 --> 02:59:15.460]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:59:15.500 --> 02:59:17.401]  The water level is always visible.
[02:59:17.581 --> 02:59:23.525]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light, and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:59:23.765 --> 02:59:27.708]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
