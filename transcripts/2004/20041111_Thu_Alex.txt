[00:00:05.862 --> 00:00:06.502]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.163 --> 00:00:08.243]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.943 --> 00:00:10.024]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.684 --> 00:00:11.544]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:13.165]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:17.647]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.027 --> 00:00:22.168]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.951]  Well, my friends, it is already Thursday, the 11th day of November 2004.
[00:00:32.296 --> 00:00:34.698]  The next three hours is going to be so important.
[00:00:34.758 --> 00:00:38.820]  An ultra-massive broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.603]  Please stay with us for the duration of this transmission.
[00:00:44.972 --> 00:01:01.517]  Bush's nominee for the Attorney General spot with the outgoing John Ashcroft, Alberto Gonzalez, is the architect of the memos that are now public where he said Bush is above federal, state, and international law.
[00:01:01.597 --> 00:01:03.317]  He can commit no crime.
[00:01:03.798 --> 00:01:06.138]  He is literally a god emperor.
[00:01:06.618 --> 00:01:08.399]  I have a copy of the memo here in front of me.
[00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.680]  He has the absolute right of kings or of dictators.
[00:01:13.237 --> 00:01:15.799]  Alberto Gonzalez, of course, an Enron lawyer.
[00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:17.720]  Good buddies with Lord Bush.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.963]  Brought into the Texas Supreme Court, then brought in as a Chief White House Legal Counsel.
[00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:26.625]  He's the guy who came up with the enemy combatant designation.
[00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:28.546]  He admits that he got the idea from this.
[00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:41.126]  From the communist Vietnamese who said, hey, we're allowed to torture American sailors and marines and army soldiers and airmen because they're pirates, they're criminals, they're rogues, they're enemy combatants.
[00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:44.168]  So, this whole system, of course, is the communist system.
[00:01:45.568 --> 00:01:46.669]  Slash fascistic.
[00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:48.650]  It's all command and control.
[00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:56.413]  And Mr. Gonzales is the architect of telling the Pentagon, you torture people, you take them to third party countries, you don't give them any rights.
[00:01:57.361 --> 00:02:06.247]  And the Army's Own Report, 75-90% of those picked up for torture at 32 camps alone in Iraq are families who didn't have their papers in order.
[00:02:07.147 --> 00:02:12.951]  So I dub him Alberto Josef Mingala Gonzalez.
[00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:16.854]  I dub him Alberto Josef Mingala Gonzalez.
[00:02:17.734 --> 00:02:21.817]  Of course, we've dubbed John Ashcroft, Ashcroft the Terrible.
[00:02:22.437 --> 00:02:24.719]  Janet Reno was the butcher of Waco Reno.
[00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:26.640]  I even got her dubbed that in the national press.
[00:02:27.265 --> 00:02:31.468]  Alberto Josef Mingala Gonzalez.
[00:02:31.488 --> 00:02:33.710]  I mean, this guy tops them all.
[00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.912]  He tops Reno out of the gates.
[00:02:35.952 --> 00:02:37.073]  He tops Ashcroft.
[00:02:37.413 --> 00:02:39.735]  He's a real piece of demonic work.
[00:02:41.796 --> 00:02:45.740]  Also, there was a small, peaceful anti-war protest in LA on a street corner.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.920]  A couple hundred people.
[00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:50.063]  And so, the US Marine Corps showed up.
[00:02:51.284 --> 00:02:55.087]  Not regular army, not National Guard, not the police in armored vehicles, but
[00:02:56.011 --> 00:03:09.834]  Light tanks with the turrets and the guns and you can't hear exactly what they're saying but the Marines pull up and yell and scream at the protesters and have their turrets swinging around with the big cannons on them and they just drive off!
[00:03:11.098 --> 00:03:13.499]  Just getting us ready for Tiananmen Square is the future.
[00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:26.182]  These very same warrior type vehicles, what they're called, I videotaped these same vehicles in Urban Warrior in 99 for Police State 2000 where the Marines were openly training to put us in camps.
[00:03:26.542 --> 00:03:29.083]  The role player screaming, we're citizens, please not the camp.
[00:03:31.984 --> 00:03:39.806]  So now, troops pull up and I look at the uniforms, either they're Marines or it's the LAPD or somebody wearing Marine Corps outfits.
[00:03:41.775 --> 00:03:47.800]  You can watch that video, by the way, at PrisonPlanet.com and, well, it's actually posted on the main page of InfoWars.net.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.564]  We've got a link over to it from PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:52.925 --> 00:03:56.848]  We'll be airing the audio of this coming up here in a few minutes as well.
[00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:05.676]  Also, we will go over some of Alberto Gonzalez's comments and his memos about how the President is above federal law.
[00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:11.700]  And if you extrapolate that out, I guess it means he can barbeque children on the White House lawn.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:19.823]  He can snort cocaine off of Dick Cheney's bald head on the television cameras.
[00:04:21.603 --> 00:04:31.847]  I guess he can lie to Congress and create false documents and invade sovereign countries and butcher the Bill of Rights, but we'll be talking about Alberto Joseph Mingala Gonzalez today.
[00:04:31.867 --> 00:04:36.348]  The Enron lawyer, the pimp,
[00:04:36.983 --> 00:04:37.784]  of the New World Order.
[00:04:40.206 --> 00:04:40.807]  Unbelievable.
[00:04:40.927 --> 00:04:43.930]  Also, we'll give you the latest updates on the battle in Fallujah.
[00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.273]  A lot of our troops dead and dying.
[00:04:47.293 --> 00:04:49.195]  Helicopters being shot down left and right.
[00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:50.996]  Bombs going off all over the country.
[00:04:51.737 --> 00:04:53.539]  Hey, bring them on, as Lord Bush said.
[00:04:53.579 --> 00:04:54.379]  I'm above the law.
[00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:54.439]  Ha!
[00:04:56.161 --> 00:04:57.643]  The President's above the law.
[00:04:57.683 --> 00:04:58.283]  Yes, he is.
[00:04:58.503 --> 00:04:59.044]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.278 --> 00:05:05.623]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.803 --> 00:05:10.209]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:14.754]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.794 --> 00:05:16.155]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.896 --> 00:05:17.877]  Panama.
[00:05:17.937 --> 00:05:22.139]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:29.143]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.263 --> 00:05:31.324]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.524 --> 00:05:42.130]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.251]  If you want to understand
[00:05:43.351 --> 00:05:43.612]  That's 888-253-3139
[00:06:00.675 --> 00:06:02.296]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:02.657 --> 00:06:08.401]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:13.805]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:23.392]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:06:23.752 --> 00:06:28.697]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:06:29.037 --> 00:06:33.061]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:06:33.241 --> 00:06:37.985]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:06:38.386 --> 00:06:44.251]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[00:08:04.193 --> 00:08:07.075]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.897 --> 00:08:11.758]  Right now at
[00:08:13.135 --> 00:08:39.749]  InfoWars.com, we have about 10 mainstream news articles where Alberto Gonzales, who will be our new Attorney General unless it's stopped at the Congress, I wouldn't hold your breath, detailing this guy who is the architect of the enemy combatant designation saying that all Americans can be designated as terrorists for any misdemeanor and can be secretly arrested and taken to third-party countries for torture.
[00:08:40.487 --> 00:08:45.511]  He's the architect of the memos to the Pentagon saying, uh, President Bush is above the law.
[00:08:45.551 --> 00:08:47.332]  He orders you to carry out torture.
[00:08:48.053 --> 00:08:57.780]  We are above, uh, the international treaties and, like the Geneva Convention, and we are above federal and state law.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.862]  Because the Pentagon was saying, we're not going to torture people.
[00:09:00.602 --> 00:09:04.846]  A lot of folks went to jail and got in trouble for this in Vietnam under orders with Copper Green.
[00:09:05.446 --> 00:09:07.948]  And they said, look, the President is above the law.
[00:09:08.573 --> 00:09:10.634]  Those memos have been public now for a year.
[00:09:11.734 --> 00:09:14.555]  So Ashcroft just carried all this evil out.
[00:09:15.756 --> 00:09:22.078]  Lord Bush's minion, this Enron lawyer, Alberto Joseph Mingola Gonzalez,
[00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:27.553]  Is just a real piece of work and I hope you'll go to InfoWars.com.
[00:09:27.853 --> 00:09:30.794]  There's one data page full of documents and information about him.
[00:09:31.355 --> 00:09:34.677]  And then another page on PrisonPlanet.com full of this.
[00:09:35.317 --> 00:09:42.521]  I hope you'll get it and email it out to everybody, post it on the message boards, and really push hard to expose this guy.
[00:09:43.281 --> 00:09:44.382]  And it can be done.
[00:09:45.162 --> 00:09:47.383]  But regardless, it just shows you the mindset.
[00:09:48.024 --> 00:09:50.085]  I mean, Gonzalez is actually a mastermind.
[00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:55.233]  Ashcroft was just a, you know, a doddering minion of all of this.
[00:09:56.454 --> 00:10:01.539]  You know, who would get up there and say there is no Patriot Act two months after he publicly introduced it.
[00:10:01.879 --> 00:10:02.720]  He's bad enough.
[00:10:03.501 --> 00:10:06.804]  In fact, I said it wouldn't matter who they appointed because they'd just be some new puppet.
[00:10:06.824 --> 00:10:08.625]  In a way that's true, but in a way I was wrong.
[00:10:09.006 --> 00:10:14.110]  This guy is actually worse, if it is possible, than John Ashcroft.
[00:10:15.171 --> 00:10:15.832]  Alberto
[00:10:16.744 --> 00:10:19.706]  Joseph Mingela Gonzalez is his new name.
[00:10:19.726 --> 00:10:20.607]  We're dubbing him that.
[00:10:21.907 --> 00:10:27.871]  In the long line of Butcher of Hueco Reno and John Ashcroft the Terrible and the rest of them.
[00:10:28.692 --> 00:10:33.335]  Also come up in a few minutes, anti-war protest in LA gets response with tanks!
[00:10:33.955 --> 00:10:43.702]  Forget armored vehicles, we're talking about tanks with the turrets and the big cannons and looks like regular Marines and they yell stuff at the protesters and try to intimidate them.
[00:10:45.097 --> 00:10:47.138]  It's Shades of Tiananmen Square.
[00:10:47.198 --> 00:10:53.159]  That video is on InfoWars.net and we'll be playing that here in a few minutes and going to your calls.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.120]  So, just amazing.
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.641]  Also, we'll get into the battle for Fallujah.
[00:10:59.321 --> 00:11:02.262]  And some interesting news, a CNN poll.
[00:11:03.962 --> 00:11:05.043]  There's never been a U.S.
[00:11:05.103 --> 00:11:11.164]  poll about 9-11 until Jimmy Walter paid for the Zogby poll.
[00:11:11.184 --> 00:11:12.305]  Zogby, highly respected.
[00:11:12.325 --> 00:11:13.785]  One of the best polling agencies out there.
[00:11:14.602 --> 00:11:18.083]  And 49% of New Yorkers believe the government ran 9-11.
[00:11:18.943 --> 00:11:21.744]  67% believe they had prior knowledge of it.
[00:11:22.744 --> 00:11:31.046]  Now, and we have that poll linked under this story at PrisonPlanet.com, now CNN, 89% believe U.S.
[00:11:31.086 --> 00:11:32.406]  government covering up 9-11.
[00:11:33.006 --> 00:11:34.246]  That was a CNN question.
[00:11:34.286 --> 00:11:35.547]  We have a screenshot of it.
[00:11:36.207 --> 00:11:37.847]  Do you believe there is a U.S.
[00:11:37.907 --> 00:11:39.708]  government cover-up surrounding 9-11?
[00:11:39.748 --> 00:11:39.948]  89% yes.
[00:11:42.623 --> 00:11:53.875]  Out of, that's 4,417 votes, no was 11% believing the government isn't involved in a cover-up, 570 votes.
[00:11:55.396 --> 00:11:57.498]  And again, this reflects the reality.
[00:11:57.699 --> 00:12:02.744]  I don't believe a poll unless it's been my experience with my interface with the public.
[00:12:03.645 --> 00:12:04.806]  And this is my experience.
[00:12:05.504 --> 00:12:07.645]  There's gotta be 1,700 interviews.
[00:12:07.725 --> 00:12:10.246]  I quit counting at 1,600 a few months ago.
[00:12:10.766 --> 00:12:24.892]  In 1,700 interviews, there have been tens of thousands of positive calls when I talk about government involvement in 9-11, and maybe, maybe a hundred who disagree with me.
[00:12:26.533 --> 00:12:29.794]  I might do four or five interviews now before somebody calls in and disagrees.
[00:12:30.915 --> 00:12:33.616]  I mean, somebody might call in and say, you're not right wing enough, or
[00:12:34.275 --> 00:12:49.038]  You know, you don't believe in my particular sub-sect of Christianity or, you know, I don't agree with you on this or that, but on the substantive big issues that we've got a tyrannical New World Order coming down on us, I don't really find anybody that disagrees.
[00:12:50.111 --> 00:12:53.433]  And now a CNN poll, 89% believe U.S.
[00:12:53.473 --> 00:12:55.495]  government covering up 9-11.
[00:12:55.995 --> 00:13:08.843]  So also, please go get this and email this link to everybody, as well as the Alberto Josef Mingala Gonzalez page that we have on InfoWars.com.
[00:13:09.503 --> 00:13:10.304]  It is up to you.
[00:13:10.404 --> 00:13:11.785]  When our millions of listeners
[00:13:12.603 --> 00:13:19.148]  Hundreds of thousands of you that are active on the internet, take action and post something on message boards and email it to the media.
[00:13:19.528 --> 00:13:21.109]  It is an unstoppable force.
[00:13:23.331 --> 00:13:27.013]  Very, very exciting to see the New World Order in deep trouble.
[00:13:28.334 --> 00:13:30.816]  In major polls, most people don't trust the vaccines.
[00:13:31.296 --> 00:13:34.919]  In major polls, 80 plus percent of Americans are against open borders.
[00:13:36.414 --> 00:13:38.474]  In most polls, people don't trust their government.
[00:13:38.514 --> 00:13:40.655]  In most polls, people don't trust the mainstream media.
[00:13:41.075 --> 00:13:43.215]  The globalists are losing credibility!
[00:13:44.316 --> 00:13:50.417]  Those that would destroy this country, those that would undermine this nation, are losing credibility.
[00:13:51.097 --> 00:13:58.359]  You know, I heard Gary Brownfield mention this today, and because he's a gentleman and I'm a gentleman, I've never talked about it, but because he mentioned it, I'll talk about it right now.
[00:13:59.659 --> 00:14:04.780]  I used to go on Gary Brownfield's show, syndicated on over 80 stations, routinely as a guest.
[00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:07.540]  He's on this network.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:13.884]  And I went on his show, on the morning of 9-11, about an hour after it happened, and I said, the U.S.
[00:14:13.904 --> 00:14:15.606]  government's behind it, here's the evidence.
[00:14:18.107 --> 00:14:20.469]  And, uh, Derry had a couple affiliates dumping.
[00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:30.576]  And he said, man, until this, he goes, his staff told me, look, we know it's true, but we're just, until it's public and documented, we're not going to cover it or have you back on, you understand.
[00:14:30.596 --> 00:14:31.257]  And I said, fine.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.262]  Somebody's got to hit the barbed wire for everybody else.
[00:14:34.602 --> 00:14:35.984]  Somebody's got to be a trailblazer.
[00:14:36.084 --> 00:14:36.484]  I'll do it.
[00:14:37.505 --> 00:14:39.707]  And in all fairness, he talked about it this morning.
[00:14:39.767 --> 00:14:43.831]  I'm driving along, about to get to my studio, and he talked about it.
[00:14:44.231 --> 00:14:45.552]  Alex said this day one.
[00:14:45.572 --> 00:14:47.834]  I actually said it two months before 9-11.
[00:14:47.874 --> 00:14:48.395]  I'm on record.
[00:14:49.381 --> 00:14:53.926]  And you know, the only reason I say this now is because I don't like people taking credit for things they didn't do.
[00:14:54.546 --> 00:14:56.849]  I am the great granddaddy of the 9-11 movement.
[00:14:57.349 --> 00:14:58.971]  I am the person that exposed it first.
[00:14:59.431 --> 00:15:01.113]  I am the person that knew two months before.
[00:15:01.133 --> 00:15:02.334]  I am the person.
[00:15:02.535 --> 00:15:05.698]  And anyone else that claims it is a big, fat liar!
[00:15:06.218 --> 00:15:20.107]  Now, I'm not into myself and how special I am and how great I am, but I have to do this now because other people are saying they're the great granddaddy of it, and so they can run the movements and tell people what's true and what's not, and then those very people attack me!
[00:15:20.427 --> 00:15:22.268]  Well, you don't know what you're talking about!
[00:15:22.549 --> 00:15:24.610]  We've been on the cutting edge of this all along!
[00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.212]  And so there, you want to hear the kind of stuff I'm really thinking about?
[00:15:29.492 --> 00:15:30.013]  That's it.
[00:15:30.393 --> 00:15:35.818]  But no, I commend Darry, who's a great guy, has a wonderfully profound and well-done program.
[00:15:36.218 --> 00:15:37.720]  We're being honest about that today.
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:42.744]  I'm talking about how I said it day one and, well, they got some heat over it and, uh, you know.
[00:15:44.978 --> 00:15:46.959]  But you see, that's the way it always works.
[00:15:47.199 --> 00:15:57.704]  So I said three years and four months ago that the world was round, and people had a lot of trouble with it, and now you're learning it's round, 89% in a major poll.
[00:15:58.605 --> 00:16:02.567]  And soon it'll be 90-plus percent, just like the Kennedy assassination.
[00:16:04.167 --> 00:16:07.269]  92% believe the government killed Kennedy in major polls now.
[00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:11.211]  On the 40th anniversary, I averaged 12 polls together.
[00:16:12.265 --> 00:16:16.249]  The average was, again, that's 92%, some were 95, some 84.
[00:16:16.689 --> 00:16:17.630]  The average, though, was 92%.
[00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:20.192]  That's your best type of poll, by the way.
[00:16:20.212 --> 00:16:21.554]  That's what the government does with polls.
[00:16:22.314 --> 00:16:28.099]  In their focus groups, they actually average up to 50 polls together to get your closer poll number.
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:32.644]  But 92% with the government killed Kennedy, and in a couple of years, it'll be 98%.
[00:16:33.805 --> 00:16:37.228]  Just like 9-11, I said that if we tell the truth, if we sacrifice
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.421]  You know, being laughed at by people at first.
[00:16:41.782 --> 00:16:46.825]  If we tell the truth, in hindsight, we will be vindicated.
[00:16:48.586 --> 00:16:50.107]  And I'd say I've been vindicated.
[00:16:50.148 --> 00:16:50.608]  Wouldn't you?
[00:16:51.649 --> 00:16:52.849]  And yes, there's no debating it.
[00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:54.270]  I am the grandfather.
[00:16:54.731 --> 00:16:55.451]  I am the first.
[00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:58.393]  I am the person that broke 9-11 two months before it happened.
[00:16:58.734 --> 00:17:04.978]  I'm the person that went on the air, day one, for all the criticism and everything and laid it out.
[00:17:06.199 --> 00:17:07.400]  And I'm not tootin' my own horn.
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.101]  I'm not gonna let other people
[00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:18.617]  In the so-called 9-11 movement, who are putting out shoddy info, dis-info, twisted info, attack me and others, they're the real trailblazers.
[00:17:20.098 --> 00:17:20.778]  Okay, there.
[00:17:21.818 --> 00:17:26.660]  I've said it, it's the facts, and you know, it's like John Wayne said, it isn't bragging if it's true.
[00:17:28.101 --> 00:17:31.982]  No brag, just fact, and put that in your pipe and smoke it, some of you out there.
[00:17:34.306 --> 00:17:36.388]  But that's the bottom line there, folks.
[00:17:36.648 --> 00:17:41.611]  And more and more people around the country are acknowledging that I am the grandfather.
[00:17:41.852 --> 00:17:44.714]  That I am the founder of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:17:44.894 --> 00:17:48.557]  That I am the founder of the move to get the Patriot Act thrown out.
[00:17:48.717 --> 00:17:49.978]  That it was my idea.
[00:17:50.098 --> 00:17:52.119]  That I wrote the articles about how people should do it.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.943]  And it's only a testament to the fact that I know we can achieve change.
[00:17:56.963 --> 00:17:58.184]  That we can save this country.
[00:17:58.564 --> 00:18:03.768]  That I come up with ideas and you, who get the real credit, the listeners, take action with it.
[00:18:04.534 --> 00:18:10.339]  And you get out there, and you get on the front lines, and you expose the New World Order, and you're where the power comes from.
[00:18:10.359 --> 00:18:21.889]  The credit goes to you, and goes to God, goes to Yahweh, goes to Jesus, who has moved your heart to tell the truth and take action, and God bless you.
[00:18:22.189 --> 00:18:28.735]  You deserve the credit, and I'm not going to let other people take the credit for what you and I and others have done.
[00:18:28.755 --> 00:18:32.698]  It's just that simple.
[00:18:33.897 --> 00:18:34.317]  Alright.
[00:18:35.838 --> 00:18:42.702]  And frankly, I'd appreciate it when people claim to be the grandfather of the 9-11 movement for you to counter them for me because I've been putting up with this long enough.
[00:18:43.383 --> 00:18:47.845]  And I've decided, I just decided here while I was talking that I might as well tell you the truth.
[00:18:48.406 --> 00:18:53.368]  Even though I don't like how it sounds, it's the truth and you've got to tell the truth no matter what the truth is.
[00:18:56.497 --> 00:18:59.838]  Again, folks, there's so much news here I want to cover.
[00:19:00.118 --> 00:19:02.258]  We'll take your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:02.278 --> 00:19:02.358]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:02.378 --> 00:19:06.679]  And I commend Gary Brownfield, three and plus years later, saying Alex was the first guy.
[00:19:06.719 --> 00:19:08.160]  Alex was there before 9-11 saying it.
[00:19:20.601 --> 00:19:26.584]  And I appreciate him, all these years later, doing what he said he'd do, and, you know, saying, I was right when it finally all came out public.
[00:19:26.604 --> 00:19:29.425]  You know, at least he's honest about that, and we appreciate him.
[00:19:29.745 --> 00:19:41.931]  But for all these other people out there who jumped on the bandwagon in the last year, six months, then claiming that, well, I'm the authority, and I'm the grandfather of all this, and you must do what I say, like I'm Moses on the mountain.
[00:19:43.151 --> 00:19:43.972]  That's ridiculous!
[00:19:45.564 --> 00:19:46.165]  All right, folks.
[00:19:46.205 --> 00:19:47.686]  We'll be back with a ton of news.
[00:19:47.927 --> 00:19:49.088]  The battle for Fallujah.
[00:19:49.328 --> 00:19:52.031]  More on Alberto, Joseph Mingala, Gonzalez.
[00:19:53.312 --> 00:19:54.674]  Oh, just so much coming up.
[00:19:54.794 --> 00:20:00.180]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.net.

[00:20:08.733 --> 00:20:11.073]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.

[00:21:01.408 --> 00:21:03.890]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I've got a gripe.
[00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:07.192]  Recently, construction in my area has doubled my commute time.
[00:21:07.352 --> 00:21:11.015]  I'm spending up to four hours in stop-and-go rush hour traffic every day.
[00:21:11.195 --> 00:21:13.636]  The worst part is there's no good talk radio to listen to.
[00:21:13.797 --> 00:21:17.039]  But that doesn't matter to me anymore, thanks to the good people at Freeway Radio.
[00:21:17.219 --> 00:21:24.564]  I've got the Sony shortwave car stereo from Freeway Radio, and now I look forward to getting comfortable in my car and hearing the real scoop on the day's news.

[00:21:48.727 --> 00:21:53.792]  Don't get me wrong, I'd still rather be golfing than sitting in traffic, but freeway radio has eased my commute immensely.
[00:21:53.892 --> 00:21:56.395]  Call them today at 1-866-404-3600 and let them do the same for you.

[00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:32.671]  That's because it has an elevated base.

[00:24:25.922 --> 00:24:30.144]  But right now, let's go to Bill in Wisconsin, who I'm told disagrees with me.
[00:24:30.164 --> 00:24:30.724]  Go ahead, Bill.
[00:24:31.885 --> 00:24:33.846]  Alex, this is Bill from Texas.
[00:24:33.926 --> 00:24:36.908]  Okay, I was told Wisconsin, but go ahead.
[00:24:37.785 --> 00:24:41.526]  No, I'm from Texas, and I've been listening to you for a good while.
[00:24:42.487 --> 00:24:51.270]  And I've seen many of your videos, and I've gone to Infowars and checked all that out.
[00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:54.571]  And I just want to say my piece, and I'm out of here.
[00:24:55.292 --> 00:24:56.832]  I am calling to disagree.
[00:24:56.892 --> 00:25:00.894]  I've heard you invite callers who disagree to call in.
[00:25:01.094 --> 00:25:01.434]  Yes, sir.
[00:25:01.534 --> 00:25:02.334]  Go ahead.
[00:25:03.495 --> 00:25:06.356]  I told myself I'd do it, and here's why I disagree.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:14.605]  I just say, I don't agree with any thing that you're talking about.
[00:25:14.625 --> 00:25:20.889]  Even though I've found much of it to be horrifically true.
[00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:29.935]  But the reason I disagree with you is because I don't like what you're saying.
[00:25:30.676 --> 00:25:34.098]  And I can't even watch, enjoy the ball game anymore.
[00:25:35.419 --> 00:25:36.620]  I can't get drunk enough.
[00:25:37.512 --> 00:25:46.456]  Forget all the horrible stuff that I've heard about, and that's why I disagree.
[00:25:46.476 --> 00:25:48.577]  Are you being sarcastic, Bill?
[00:25:49.458 --> 00:26:00.883]  Well, I am, but it is for the listeners to know that folks who don't enjoy hearing Alex Jones, and the other day you said that you
[00:26:01.727 --> 00:26:04.469]  You said, folks, I know I'm obnoxious.
[00:26:04.609 --> 00:26:05.530]  I know I'm annoying.
[00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:09.312]  I can't stand to listen to myself sometimes on the rebroadcast.
[00:26:09.332 --> 00:26:16.217]  Well, I want to tell you, you are a voice that is pleasant to hear.
[00:26:16.598 --> 00:26:25.664]  And people who want to listen, have the courage to listen, will actually find your most maniacal rants to be actually soothing and inspiring.
[00:26:26.785 --> 00:26:30.808]  And, uh, but you know, Bill, uh,
[00:26:32.202 --> 00:26:33.482]  I hope some people got that.
[00:26:34.443 --> 00:26:35.203]  Well, I appreciate it.
[00:26:35.223 --> 00:26:40.884]  You know, I try to reflect the true maniacal nature of what I'm looking at, what is clear, what I've tried.
[00:26:40.984 --> 00:26:45.306]  I try to disprove what I'm seeing, what I'm reading, what I'm documenting, Bill.
[00:26:45.866 --> 00:26:48.386]  And I wish none of this was true, but it is true.
[00:26:48.807 --> 00:26:50.107]  This is what's upon us.
[00:26:51.427 --> 00:26:57.389]  I've had somebody say, you know, this is Alex's bread and butter.
[00:26:57.429 --> 00:27:01.390]  You know, if he didn't have this to talk about, I'd tell him, you know what there, mister?
[00:27:02.133 --> 00:27:05.758]  This is the last thing Alex Jones would like to be talking about.
[00:27:05.778 --> 00:27:08.802]  He wished none of this horrible stuff was going on.
[00:27:09.002 --> 00:27:10.024]  You know what he'd be doing?
[00:27:10.404 --> 00:27:12.908]  If it weren't all going on, he'd be having fun.
[00:27:13.388 --> 00:27:18.676]  And we'd live in a wonderful world, but he wants to make sure that people
[00:27:20.051 --> 00:27:40.427]  Now, the horrible thing that's wanting to make this a horrible world, and my only second other thing that I'll say to why most people don't like Alex Jones, and don't care for him, or say, well, he's crazy, and well, you know, he says a lot of crazy stuff, or whatever, is because you threaten a lot of armchair generals' manhood.
[00:27:40.447 --> 00:27:48.514]  Because the listener and the viewer is forced to ask himself, what in the heck is it that I do?
[00:27:48.574 --> 00:27:49.575]  What do I stand for?
[00:27:51.911 --> 00:27:53.172]  Anyway, we'll talk to you later.
[00:27:53.192 --> 00:27:53.612]  Good show.
[00:27:53.632 --> 00:27:54.393]  Talk to you later.
[00:27:54.453 --> 00:27:55.774]  Alright, good to hear from you, Bill.
[00:27:55.994 --> 00:28:02.619]  And again, I say call and disagree with me and usually it's somebody joking around like that, but that was eloquent what you said, Bill, and thank you.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:11.025]  You know, we have to face the horror of what the real world is offering us because it affects our children.
[00:28:11.226 --> 00:28:19.632]  And if you don't care about your children, if you don't have children, what about your nephews and nieces or your neighbors or your family or your cousins?
[00:28:20.552 --> 00:28:22.774]  I mean, the dollar just plunged again.
[00:28:24.395 --> 00:28:26.837]  The free trade area of America is coming online.
[00:28:26.897 --> 00:28:30.340]  Bush is going to have total, blanket, absolute, complete amnesty.
[00:28:31.641 --> 00:28:33.983]  They're putting face scanning cameras up everywhere.
[00:28:34.763 --> 00:28:41.188]  They're about to start forced psychological testing and forced psychological drugging of every child in America and then every American.
[00:28:41.969 --> 00:28:43.430]  It's all happening!
[00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:46.292]  And if you deny it's happening, it doesn't go away.
[00:28:47.733 --> 00:28:49.675]  Janet in California, go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:28:51.158 --> 00:28:53.279]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call today.
[00:28:53.299 --> 00:28:54.079]  Thanks for calling.
[00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:58.441]  I actually have a question for you regarding free speech.
[00:28:58.921 --> 00:29:08.686]  I'm actually a really big Howard Stern fan and I wanted to know what you thought about the whole situation with him and with Bush getting back into office, how that's going to affect things.
[00:29:10.646 --> 00:29:14.228]  I think Howard Stern is an intellectual prostitute.
[00:29:15.074 --> 00:29:21.939]  I think Howard Stern sort of telling the truth about 9-11 and stuff because he saw where the wave was going, and because he was angry at the FCC.
[00:29:21.979 --> 00:29:27.083]  I think he has courage to call up Colin Powell's son on the radio and call him inept.
[00:29:28.183 --> 00:29:38.651]  I think that the profane things he does overall are not good for society, but it's his right, especially if it's on satellite, not on broadcast radio, to do it.
[00:29:39.326 --> 00:29:50.533]  And I think that the things neocons calling for torture and secret arrest of citizens to put them in camps is more obscene than dirty words that Stern occasionally uses.
[00:29:51.574 --> 00:29:51.834]  Right.
[00:29:51.954 --> 00:29:56.597]  Overall, I think a boxing match is more obscene, two men beating each other half to death.
[00:29:56.638 --> 00:29:57.798]  And I'm a little sick.
[00:29:57.858 --> 00:29:58.719]  I even like boxing.
[00:30:01.368 --> 00:30:03.069]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:30:03.149 --> 00:30:05.650]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:06.530]  It feels great.
[00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:07.691]  Absolutely wonderful.
[00:30:07.831 --> 00:30:13.373]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:30:13.673 --> 00:30:15.194]  Kimberly, tell us about your success.
[00:30:15.454 --> 00:30:17.835]  Okay, I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[00:30:17.995 --> 00:30:21.176]  I've lost 16 pounds, and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[00:30:21.276 --> 00:30:21.937]  Incredible.
[00:30:22.137 --> 00:30:23.477]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[00:30:23.517 --> 00:30:27.059]  I'm a 21-month-old child, and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[00:30:27.179 --> 00:30:28.000]  Well that's for sure.
[00:30:28.141 --> 00:30:28.721]  Was it easy?
[00:30:28.942 --> 00:30:29.563]  Very easy.
[00:30:29.603 --> 00:30:30.484]  I mean there's nothing to it.
[00:30:30.504 --> 00:30:35.713]  You can actually still continue to eat meals with your children and not starve yourself or anything else and lose weight.
[00:30:35.933 --> 00:30:42.163]  I know you can lose fat the safe and healthy way just like Kimberly did with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:30:42.523 --> 00:30:43.344]  Call right now.
[00:30:43.364 --> 00:30:43.704]  1-800-622-THIN.
[00:30:43.744 --> 00:30:44.425]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:30:44.445 --> 00:30:47.768]  Remember, mention you heard it right here, and that gets you $25 off a 3-month supply.
[00:30:48.028 --> 00:30:49.570]  So call Vim and Vigor today.
[00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:49.790]  1-800-622-THIN.
[00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:50.351]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:31:01.241 --> 00:31:06.466]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:31:06.627 --> 00:31:14.715]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:31:14.975 --> 00:31:22.022]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:31:22.202 --> 00:31:23.483]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:31:23.563 --> 00:31:29.449]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:31:29.649 --> 00:31:34.754]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:31:34.854 --> 00:31:43.683]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[00:31:43.963 --> 00:31:44.283]  Let's go!
[00:32:00.626 --> 00:32:03.769]  I tried glucosamine for my arthritis, but it didn't help much.
[00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:06.412]  They tell me I just have to put up with my joint pain and stiffness.
[00:32:06.692 --> 00:32:11.857]  Are you doomed to a life of stiff and painful joints or dealing with expensive medications or painful injections?
[00:32:12.018 --> 00:32:12.718]  Well, no more.
[00:32:12.898 --> 00:32:15.841]  I'm pleased to tell you about a totally new product called Injuve.
[00:32:16.142 --> 00:32:19.365]  Rather than stopping the pain, Injuve attacks the causes of joint pain.
[00:32:19.605 --> 00:32:25.107]  Injuve replenishes what your body was born with by replacing a vital fluid your body loses as you grow older.
[00:32:25.327 --> 00:32:27.867]  It's called hyaluronic acid or HA.
[00:32:28.148 --> 00:32:35.930]  It's important to note that Injuve does not cure arthritis, but it helps reverse the aging process of our joints and reduces the pain and stiffness caused by lack of mobility.
[00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:39.351]  Injuve is one of the best lubricants and shock absorbers found in nature.
[00:32:39.551 --> 00:32:43.792]  In short, if you have joint pain or arthritis, you owe it to yourself to try Injuve.
[00:32:44.092 --> 00:32:47.053]  Injuve is all natural and comes in easy to swallow soft gels.
[00:32:47.273 --> 00:32:48.154]  They railed against the crowd.
[00:33:11.667 --> 00:33:14.428]  Another ragtag band.
[00:33:14.488 --> 00:33:16.209]  Declaring.
[00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:24.814]  They laid their bodies down.
[00:33:24.854 --> 00:33:27.615]  In a bloody war.
[00:33:28.416 --> 00:33:28.976]  For liberty.
[00:33:31.877 --> 00:33:33.959]  Their descendants.
[00:33:35.339 --> 00:33:37.020]  Thank you for joining us, my friends.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.221]  We got caught off there.
[00:33:39.429 --> 00:33:42.451]  Before the last break, talking to Janet in California.
[00:33:42.831 --> 00:33:44.392]  Janet, you bring up Howard Stern.
[00:33:44.432 --> 00:33:45.893]  I mean, I think he's profane.
[00:33:45.953 --> 00:34:06.887]  I think that it is bad for children to hear stuff like that in the morning, but compared to neocons on the radio saying, arrest anyone that disagrees with the government, put them in forced labor camps, as Michael Wiener Savage says, to have people saying torture's good, torturing somebody is just blowing off steam,
[00:34:08.081 --> 00:34:12.984]  I mean, even Joseph Mingala, the Nazi torture master, did what he did behind closed doors.
[00:34:13.024 --> 00:34:14.965]  We've gone to a new level of announcing it openly.
[00:34:15.285 --> 00:34:19.707]  That is light years more obscene than Howard Stern using potty humor.
[00:34:20.848 --> 00:34:29.613]  But I think that the FCC has used him as a case point example to try to regulate and control other speech and try to rewrite laws over the internet and satellite.
[00:34:30.572 --> 00:34:33.873]  I was just going to say, I just thought it was kind of ironic the way
[00:34:51.601 --> 00:35:00.748]  When he was supporting Bush, he didn't really have any problems with the SEC, but when he started going against Bush, all of a sudden the SEC just came crashing down on him.
[00:35:01.469 --> 00:35:04.811]  Yeah, it's all selective enforcement, and Janet, I appreciate your call.
[00:35:05.992 --> 00:35:10.455]  We'll go to Bill and Robert and Mike and Ed and hear others here in a few minutes.
[00:35:10.475 --> 00:35:12.937]  Let me go ahead and get into more of this news.
[00:35:14.979 --> 00:35:16.680]  This is out of News 24.
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.682]  Bush nominates Gonzalez
[00:35:19.679 --> 00:35:30.946]  President George W. Bush on Wednesday named White House Counsel Alberto Joseph Mingala Gonzalez as the new United States Attorney General, making him the highest-ranking Hispanic in any U.S.
[00:35:30.966 --> 00:35:31.687]  administration.
[00:35:33.468 --> 00:35:34.609]  That shouldn't even matter.
[00:35:34.649 --> 00:35:38.151]  I don't care what group he's with, I care about his policies.
[00:35:38.771 --> 00:35:44.475]  With Senate confirmation of the nomination, Gonzalez will replace John Ashcroft, whose resignation
[00:35:45.365 --> 00:35:46.687]  was announced on Tuesday.
[00:35:46.707 --> 00:35:54.515]  It is one of several changes expected to be made following Bush's re-election last week to a four-year term.
[00:35:55.327 --> 00:36:07.249]  But human rights advocates immediately signaled they would oppose the nomination, saying Gonzales has advocated and encouraged the summary treatment of suspects detained in post-9-11 anti-terror campaign.
[00:36:07.809 --> 00:36:19.892]  As White House counsel, Gonzales was the architect of the Bush administration's policy of placing detainees captured in the fight against terrorism beyond the protection of any laws, said Human Rights Watch U.S.
[00:36:19.952 --> 00:36:21.552]  Director Jamie Fellner.
[00:36:23.647 --> 00:36:28.270]  And he is the man who came up with the enemy combatant designation for U.S.
[00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:29.931]  citizens, stripping them of all rights.
[00:36:30.331 --> 00:36:36.335]  He is the man in a memo to the Defense Department, who didn't want to torture people, saying, look, follow orders.
[00:36:37.836 --> 00:36:42.379]  The President is above the quaint international law and federal law.
[00:36:42.459 --> 00:36:43.640]  He is the law.
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:45.341]  We even have those quotes.
[00:36:46.161 --> 00:36:48.543]  I am the law, Judge Dredd, the executioner.
[00:36:49.227 --> 00:37:02.315]  I mean, when you've got a dictatorship, when you've got a god-king, a great leader, a maximum leader, when you've got that, you've got tyranny 110% WDA choice brand tyranny.
[00:37:05.116 --> 00:37:06.457]  Premium tyranny, folks.
[00:37:06.637 --> 00:37:07.738]  Top shelf tyranny.
[00:37:07.798 --> 00:37:08.638]  As good as it gets.
[00:37:08.718 --> 00:37:10.059]  Beluga caviar tyranny.
[00:37:11.119 --> 00:37:17.724]  And this is the guy who was advising Ashcroft, and advising the Defense Department, and advising... This guy is a piece of work!
[00:37:17.764 --> 00:37:19.345]  I mean, he's actually a brain!
[00:37:20.106 --> 00:37:25.010]  And guess where else we have found where he got his ideas for enemy combatant designation?
[00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:28.792]  The North Vietnamese, when they... They said, oh, we follow the U.N.
[00:37:29.653 --> 00:37:34.757]  Geneva Convention, and we have our own laws in Northern Vietnam against torture, unless...
[00:37:35.669 --> 00:37:46.399]  You're a criminal, or a pirate, or a terrorist, a gangster, these are the terms they use, and they said, we're giving you an enemy combatant designation.
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:56.248]  A criminal designation, and so they openly tortured our airmen, our sailors, our marines, our army soldiers, in many cases to death!
[00:37:57.794 --> 00:38:13.579]  And Mr. Gonzales, I would guess probably got this from the Justice Department minion who is Vietnamese himself, who helped write the Patriot Act with Gonzales, has come out with these same terms used by the North Vietnamese government.
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:22.602]  And so, under Section 802 that he also helped write, all Americans are designated as terrorists,
[00:38:23.493 --> 00:38:25.434]  If we're under the suspicion of any misdemeanor.
[00:38:25.875 --> 00:38:29.357]  Hench people selling knock-off Rubik's Cubes are hit by Homeland Security.
[00:38:29.697 --> 00:38:32.980]  Veterans complaining to the VA are arrested by Homeland Security.
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:36.202]  Pot dealers, county commissioners, potless bar owners.
[00:38:37.242 --> 00:38:38.964]  You name it, everything is terrorism.
[00:38:40.485 --> 00:38:46.569]  And this is the guy, Alberto Josef Mingala Gonzalez.
[00:38:47.521 --> 00:38:50.522]  I dubbed him Alberto Joseph Mingala Gonzalez.
[00:38:50.982 --> 00:38:51.963]  That's his new name.
[00:38:52.403 --> 00:38:56.565]  And again, we got national attention with Janet the Butcher of Waco, Reno.
[00:38:56.645 --> 00:38:57.585]  Got that in major papers.
[00:38:58.365 --> 00:39:01.107]  And so we're going to keep pushing that name because he deserves it.
[00:39:01.887 --> 00:39:03.427]  I talked about this guy years ago.
[00:39:04.428 --> 00:39:08.049]  And I have all the mainstream news articles where he said we're above the law.
[00:39:08.109 --> 00:39:09.430]  We are above the law.
[00:39:11.747 --> 00:39:17.212]  When you've got governments openly saying they're above the law, and I am the law, you've got big problems.
[00:39:18.894 --> 00:39:20.415]  You are not above the Supreme Court.
[00:39:20.495 --> 00:39:23.598]  You are not, even though you're puppets, you're not above the Congress.
[00:39:24.919 --> 00:39:29.303]  You execute the laws of the Congress, Executive.
[00:39:32.266 --> 00:39:33.387]  You are not a dictator.
[00:39:34.443 --> 00:39:42.805]  You may claim you are Alberto Josef Mingala Gonzalez, your new Attorney General, if they confirm him, is not above the law.
[00:39:42.865 --> 00:39:46.565]  It'll go through Orrin Hatch's hands and through Senator Specter's hands.
[00:39:48.166 --> 00:39:51.666]  That's why Bush wants Specter in there over the confirmation hearings.
[00:39:51.686 --> 00:39:56.007]  Mr. Pro-abort, who says, don't send me any nominees who are anti-abortion.
[00:39:56.768 --> 00:40:04.049]  So he's going to just love Alberto Josef Mingala Gonzalez because he is called a liberal Republican.
[00:40:05.606 --> 00:40:06.447]  He's very liberal.
[00:40:06.507 --> 00:40:07.428]  He's for torture.
[00:40:09.491 --> 00:40:14.758]  And I've got his memo right here where the president is above international and federal state law.
[00:40:14.778 --> 00:40:19.384]  He can direct agencies to do whatever he wishes.
[00:40:21.998 --> 00:40:24.460]  Giant alarms should be going off right now.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.221]  Symbols banging in your head.
[00:40:26.241 --> 00:40:28.122]  This is a red alert.
[00:40:28.242 --> 00:40:30.884]  Please go to InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:40:31.284 --> 00:40:44.653]  Email those detailed data pages that we put together with his quotes, mainstream news, documents, photos of people tortured to death, the Army report admitting that this was all ordered, and email it out to everyone in mass.
[00:40:45.754 --> 00:40:46.094]  Please.
[00:40:48.681 --> 00:40:51.264]  And we'll get more into this guy, more on the Battle of Fallujah.
[00:40:51.304 --> 00:40:56.048]  The CNN poll, 89% of people believe the government's covering up 9-11 in a major CNN poll.
[00:40:56.068 --> 00:41:06.739]  We're going to cover all of this, but right now, before we go to your calls, anti-war protest in LA gets response with tanks.
[00:41:08.456 --> 00:41:09.557]  What the heck happened in L.A.
[00:41:09.597 --> 00:41:10.077]  last night?
[00:41:10.117 --> 00:41:19.402]  A peaceful anti-war protest in Westwood that a Robocop response, two armored tanks, actual tanks with turrets and guns, came to dispel the protest.
[00:41:19.743 --> 00:41:28.748]  It's unknown at this moment whether the protesters had permits or what the rationale for bringing the armored response was by officials, but what kind of rationale could possibly merit this approach?
[00:41:30.003 --> 00:41:32.704]  This was now three days ago, or two days ago, the night of November 9th.
[00:41:33.144 --> 00:41:37.807]  Two armored tanks showed up at the anti-war protest in front of the Federal Building in Westwood.
[00:41:38.087 --> 00:41:44.850]  The tanks circled the block twice, the second time parking themselves in the street directly in front of the area where most of the protesters were gathered.
[00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:50.332]  In a raid, some of the people attempted to block the tanks, but police quickly cleared the street.
[00:41:50.392 --> 00:41:58.896]  The people continued to protest the presence of the tanks, but about ten minutes after the tanks drove off, it was unclear as to why the tanks were deployed to the location.
[00:42:00.299 --> 00:42:02.642]  And I have spent time looking at the video.
[00:42:02.682 --> 00:42:03.723]  It's clear video.
[00:42:04.223 --> 00:42:07.306]  These are the large, jumbo-sized armored vehicles.
[00:42:07.767 --> 00:42:09.409]  They're tanks with six wheels.
[00:42:10.049 --> 00:42:18.979]  We saw the exact same vehicles in Oakland doing urban warfare with American citizens, paid role players going, I'm an American, knock the camp.
[00:42:19.379 --> 00:42:21.181]  Mock interrogations, where'd you get the gun?
[00:42:21.221 --> 00:42:21.701]  Where do you live?
[00:42:21.741 --> 00:42:22.723]  I live in San Francisco.
[00:42:23.403 --> 00:42:28.346]  You know, we've got these drills on tape, and these uniforms look like Marine Corps uniforms.
[00:42:28.486 --> 00:42:30.087]  I don't know if it's Army, Marine Corps.
[00:42:30.447 --> 00:42:33.169]  Calls have been made to the Federal Building, to Schwarzenegger's office.
[00:42:34.169 --> 00:42:36.351]  He himself was a tank driver in the Austrian Army.
[00:42:37.531 --> 00:42:38.452]  A good little punk.
[00:42:39.272 --> 00:42:42.454]  And now we've got this happening, and they yell at the people.
[00:42:42.494 --> 00:42:43.655]  The police yell at them.
[00:42:44.315 --> 00:42:47.777]  They've got their machine guns and their weapons aimed at the people.
[00:42:48.638 --> 00:42:50.699]  Their huge cannons mounted on the tanks.
[00:42:52.765 --> 00:42:53.205]  Oh boy.
[00:42:54.406 --> 00:42:55.707]  Just open conditioning.
[00:42:56.447 --> 00:42:59.409]  Then they pull up with their tanks and drive them back and forth in front of the crowd.
[00:42:59.809 --> 00:43:01.150]  Police laugh at the crowd.
[00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:03.771]  How dare you!
[00:43:03.811 --> 00:43:05.172]  A couple hundred peaceful people.
[00:43:05.212 --> 00:43:11.899]  So let's go ahead and play the audio from the video and I'll make comments as it plays about 30 seconds into this video.
[00:43:12.279 --> 00:43:14.501]  Peaceful crowd on the sidewalk, not even in the street.
[00:43:14.801 --> 00:43:18.465]  Police ready to arrest them the minute they step in the street or fire rubber bullets at them.
[00:43:18.485 --> 00:43:21.107]  In many cases, killing or wounding people when they do do this.
[00:43:21.568 --> 00:43:25.832]  And then up pulls two gigantic armored tanks.
[00:43:26.292 --> 00:43:27.033]  Go ahead and play that.
[00:43:28.295 --> 00:43:31.236]  So here they are, protesting.
[00:43:31.276 --> 00:43:34.617]  Turn it up a little bit.
[00:43:34.657 --> 00:43:36.437]  Now here comes the tanks.
[00:43:56.161 --> 00:43:58.154]  Pulling up, right up on the edge of the curb.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.601]  Cars are honking at the people happily.
[00:44:05.761 --> 00:44:07.682]  Here come the tanks.
[00:44:07.842 --> 00:44:14.726]  Obviously trying to create a provocation.
[00:44:14.746 --> 00:44:19.668]  The troops are now screaming at the people.
[00:44:35.245 --> 00:44:37.326]  The police run over trying to start a riot.
[00:44:38.407 --> 00:44:39.168]  It did not work.
[00:44:39.948 --> 00:44:42.030]  Tiananmen Square, folks.
[00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:45.212]  They're training you for Tiananmen Square.
[00:44:45.232 --> 00:44:47.233]  They're already killing our citizens in the streets.
[00:44:47.613 --> 00:44:48.534]  Innocent young women.
[00:44:49.254 --> 00:44:54.558]  We're not supposed to have tanks in the streets in America.
[00:44:54.678 --> 00:44:56.619]  I just heard one of the protesters.
[00:44:56.659 --> 00:44:57.760]  Bring the troops on down!
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:58.361]  Bring the troops on down!
[00:45:08.747 --> 00:45:13.492]  So, this went on for 10 minutes.
[00:45:33.556 --> 00:45:36.098]  And then finally, the tanks drive away.
[00:45:36.819 --> 00:46:00.218]  So to understand, folks, peaceful protesters are out there fighting for the rights of those troops who, if they get sent to Iraq, will be breathing depleted uranium, being given experimental injections against federal law.
[00:46:03.377 --> 00:46:05.218]  Now they cheer as the tanks drive away.
[00:46:05.238 --> 00:46:23.370]  And again, this crowd should have been saying to the tanks, they give you deadly vaccines, they make you breathe DU.
[00:46:24.191 --> 00:46:25.032]  It's not good.
[00:46:25.052 --> 00:46:27.053]  The war is a fraud.
[00:46:27.093 --> 00:46:29.515]  We put Saddam into power, told him to invade Iran.
[00:46:29.535 --> 00:46:31.416]  Told him to invade Kuwait.
[00:46:33.627 --> 00:46:34.567]  They don't know how to do that.
[00:46:36.088 --> 00:46:38.888]  But that's okay, at least they're not demonstrating against the illegal war.
[00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:47.331]  And now the intimidation is, you come back out and protest, see the tanks show up with three heavy machine guns and a giant cannon.
[00:46:49.071 --> 00:46:54.593]  Complete with turrets and what are clearly wearing Marine Corps tanker gear.
[00:46:56.953 --> 00:46:59.154]  This is the primary fighting vehicle of the U.S.
[00:46:59.174 --> 00:46:59.734]  Marine Corps.
[00:47:03.422 --> 00:47:05.804]  Show!
[00:47:06.344 --> 00:47:07.505]  And there go the tanks!
[00:47:08.725 --> 00:47:09.146]  Go!
[00:47:09.266 --> 00:47:10.166]  Go back, tanks!
[00:47:13.168 --> 00:47:14.049]  Unbelievable!
[00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:16.390]  Unbelievable!
[00:47:17.291 --> 00:47:19.652]  Bill in Wisconsin, you're on the air, go ahead, sir.
[00:47:20.453 --> 00:47:23.595]  Yeah, I almost got accused of being against you, Alex, there.
[00:47:23.635 --> 00:47:25.055]  You had that Bill from Texas.
[00:47:25.556 --> 00:47:26.396]  That's okay, go ahead.
[00:47:26.596 --> 00:47:32.300]  Yeah, hey, uh, yesterday, and again, the only time I listened to this character,
[00:47:33.052 --> 00:47:34.032]  When I'm in the car.
[00:47:34.693 --> 00:47:39.335]  But on Sean Hannity's show, he had Greg Pallas.
[00:47:40.615 --> 00:47:46.698]  And the reason he had him on there was to try to humiliate him and shout over him.
[00:47:47.498 --> 00:47:56.082]  But, you know, Greg brought out a few good points concerning the staged election and the vote fraud and so forth.
[00:47:56.142 --> 00:48:00.964]  But Hannity, you know, was just absolutely brutal.
[00:48:01.707 --> 00:48:08.169]  But prior to that, there were two calls from these hannitized idiots that follow him.
[00:48:08.189 --> 00:48:11.690]  Ultra-communists that are so communized they don't even know they're communists.
[00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:13.710]  But listen to this, okay?
[00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:22.593]  They're all concerned about this immigration reform that Bush is once again bringing out into the open.
[00:48:22.753 --> 00:48:26.414]  Total blanket record amnesty, but it's not amnesty.
[00:48:26.794 --> 00:48:27.534]  Right, right.
[00:48:28.072 --> 00:48:40.793]  But see, even these people are starting to say, because the one guy wondered, he said, you know, he said you, you, you bet, uh, support Bush all the way and so do I, but, you know, I don't think this is right.
[00:48:41.884 --> 00:48:46.988]  And, uh, you know, Hannity, I can see how he's trying to manipulate his audience.
[00:48:47.048 --> 00:48:47.748]  I've heard him before.
[00:48:47.768 --> 00:48:49.809]  He goes, yeah, it's a problem, but we gotta do something.
[00:48:49.849 --> 00:48:51.010]  Maybe we should be for it.
[00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.871]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:48:52.111 --> 00:48:55.353]  And maybe, you know, this is a plan to legalize them, so at least we know who they are.
[00:48:55.373 --> 00:48:58.455]  Yeah, see, then under the National ID Card, the illegals will have to do it.
[00:48:58.755 --> 00:49:02.858]  Then anybody that comes here, then signs up with this system, it legalizes everybody.
[00:49:03.118 --> 00:49:03.438]  Yeah.
[00:49:04.519 --> 00:49:06.761]  But I think, here's what I think we ought to do.
[00:49:07.481 --> 00:49:08.902]  Both Gonzalez and
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:10.821]  You know, call the White House.
[00:49:10.841 --> 00:49:11.962]  You're not calling Gonzalez.
[00:49:12.482 --> 00:49:15.645]  Okay, his name is Joseph Mingala Gonzalez.
[00:49:15.745 --> 00:49:18.127]  Alberto Joseph Mingala Gonzalez.
[00:49:18.407 --> 00:49:20.509]  Well, you call him what you want.
[00:49:20.529 --> 00:49:24.412]  On ABC News last night, they're playing this up.
[00:49:24.492 --> 00:49:32.278]  They showed his home roots, you know, the two bedroom house where the large Hispanic family was raised.
[00:49:32.298 --> 00:49:33.879]  You know, they're going to
[00:49:34.358 --> 00:49:35.419]  Hey, look, it's clear.
[00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:37.039]  They're going to imply you're a racist.
[00:49:37.059 --> 00:49:37.440]  That's right.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:41.101]  And you don't like Mr. Joseph Mendoza Gonzalez.
[00:49:41.321 --> 00:49:43.823]  Hey, I didn't like John Ashcroft, and he's a white guy.
[00:49:43.843 --> 00:49:48.345]  This is not going to work, and it is nothing but pandering and pure manipulation.
[00:49:48.645 --> 00:49:51.726]  If Bush appointed a Hispanic who was pro-Bill of Rights, I would love him.
[00:49:51.947 --> 00:49:53.247]  But you know that isn't going to happen.
[00:49:53.447 --> 00:49:54.288]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:49:54.588 --> 00:49:55.308]  Well, here's what.
[00:49:55.368 --> 00:49:57.509]  I think listeners ought to flood the White House.
[00:49:57.989 --> 00:49:59.350]  We want the borders closed.
[00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:01.211]  We want the borders closed.
[00:50:02.034 --> 00:50:05.717]  In other words, we want conservative principles.
[00:50:05.777 --> 00:50:08.039]  Supposedly, he has a mandate.
[00:50:08.399 --> 00:50:21.790]  Bush has the House, the Senate, 30 plus governors, most of the legislatures, he has the Supreme Court, he has most of the federal courts, he has the executive, got an even bigger majority, so let's see some gun bans repealed.
[00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:23.491]  Let's see the borders controlled.
[00:50:23.511 --> 00:50:24.812]  Let's see you get out of UNESCO.
[00:50:25.112 --> 00:50:25.653]  That's right.
[00:50:25.813 --> 00:50:28.415]  In other words, let's see the
[00:50:29.938 --> 00:50:34.060]  Supreme Court nominees that we need, which we're not going to see.
[00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:37.261]  What do you want to bet in four years, abortion is just as legal as it is today?
[00:50:37.321 --> 00:50:38.601]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[00:50:38.981 --> 00:50:45.144]  Yeah, and Gonzalez, when he was on the Texas Supreme Court, ruled against parental notification.
[00:50:45.344 --> 00:50:47.985]  Yeah, oh I know, he's an extreme abortion lover.
[00:50:48.305 --> 00:50:48.485]  Yep.
[00:50:49.005 --> 00:50:51.386]  So you're bad, so you're for abortion because you're against it.
[00:50:51.706 --> 00:50:53.647]  You're against abortion, so you're for abortion.
[00:50:53.767 --> 00:50:54.947]  Yeah, call the White House.
[00:50:54.987 --> 00:50:57.368]  You're against amnesty, so you're for amnesty.
[00:50:58.127 --> 00:50:59.627]  Learn double think there, Bill.
[00:50:59.647 --> 00:51:00.408]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.648 --> 00:51:03.168]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.368 --> 00:51:06.449]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.589 --> 00:51:10.470]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:14.751]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:15.111 --> 00:51:18.892]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:19.012 --> 00:51:20.812]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:21.052 --> 00:51:24.313]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[00:51:24.373 --> 00:51:29.055]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.235 --> 00:51:32.276]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.456 --> 00:51:35.317]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.817 --> 00:51:41.939]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.459 --> 00:51:46.263]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:51:46.664 --> 00:51:48.025]  Order your video today.
[00:51:48.366 --> 00:51:49.427]  Call toll-free at 888-253-3139.
[00:51:49.447 --> 00:51:52.570]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.

[00:52:01.299 --> 00:52:04.861]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:52:04.901 --> 00:52:05.421]  are located?
[00:52:05.621 --> 00:52:09.002]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:52:09.222 --> 00:52:13.924]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:07.121]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[00:54:07.621 --> 00:54:13.382]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:13.462 --> 00:54:27.765]  Understand folks, Alberto Josef Mingala Gonzalez was an Enron lawyer, as you just heard, is documented, voted against parental consent, so when your 12 year old daughter goes to have an abortion, you're not told.
[00:54:29.225 --> 00:54:34.046]  The guy wrote the memos about how our government's allowed to torture citizens and foreigners,
[00:54:35.163 --> 00:54:39.405]  And then the Pentagon followed those orders and engaged in mass torture people to death.
[00:54:40.325 --> 00:54:42.166]  And now he wants to be your Attorney General.
[00:54:42.226 --> 00:54:44.047]  Lord Bush wants him to be your Attorney General.
[00:54:45.428 --> 00:54:46.788]  That's a big, big deal.
[00:54:46.828 --> 00:54:55.913]  Before we go back to the calls, before we go to Robert and Mike and Ed and Don and Vance and others, we've got a guest coming up too with inside knowledge of 9-11.
[00:54:58.038 --> 00:54:59.859]  We'll also get into CNN.
[00:54:59.879 --> 00:55:02.021]  89% of those polled believe the government's covering up 9-11.
[00:55:02.041 --> 00:55:02.021]  89%.
[00:55:02.961 --> 00:55:05.703]  A bunch of news on the battle for Fallujah.
[00:55:05.723 --> 00:55:08.605]  A lot of helicopters and stuff getting shot down.
[00:55:09.426 --> 00:55:12.688]  The open border proposals that we knew were coming, as usual.
[00:55:12.708 --> 00:55:14.169]  Of course, very conservative.
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:17.161]  I have made 11 films.
[00:55:17.221 --> 00:55:20.163]  The 11th is American Dictators Documenting the Staged Election of 2004.
[00:55:21.063 --> 00:55:26.306]  It's so important now you get this video so your friends and family will know why the election was staged.
[00:55:26.366 --> 00:55:28.648]  How Kerry was part of the whole thing with Bush.
[00:55:28.688 --> 00:55:29.548]  How there was no difference.
[00:55:30.028 --> 00:55:32.270]  Your poor liberal friends need this.
[00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:36.052]  Your poor neocon friends need this to break their mental conditioning.
[00:55:37.421 --> 00:55:42.623]  A copy of DVD or VHS of the almost two hour film is $19.95.
[00:55:42.963 --> 00:55:46.704]  Each additional copy on DVD is $5.95.

[00:55:53.666 --> 00:55:54.986]  Make copies of it if you want.
[00:55:55.146 --> 00:55:55.586]  Whatever.
[00:55:55.606 --> 00:55:56.847]  You want to give somebody a nice gift though.
[00:55:56.867 --> 00:56:00.508]  The original with the color cover and the stamped DVD and you know all that.

[00:56:10.175 --> 00:56:11.656]  Almost three hours long.
[00:56:11.676 --> 00:56:17.779]  $24.95 each additional copy of 9-11 The Road to Tyranny.
[00:56:17.799 --> 00:56:19.579]  $5.95 when you buy one copy.
[00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:21.040]  Get four or five copies.
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:21.800]  Give them to everybody.
[00:56:22.121 --> 00:56:22.961]  Wake people up.

[00:57:06.569 --> 00:57:07.410]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001.
[00:57:18.627 --> 00:57:19.387]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:57:19.407 --> 00:57:19.487]  Good.
[00:57:19.507 --> 00:57:26.269]  I was wondering if you'd heard about a segment Tuesday night on MSNBC on a show called Countdown with Keith Olbermann?
[00:57:26.289 --> 00:57:28.310]  Nah, well, what were they talking about?
[00:57:48.157 --> 00:57:54.498]  They were talking about the commercials put on by Jimmy Walters about Building 7 and why did the buildings collapse.
[00:57:55.939 --> 00:57:56.799]  Did you type that?
[00:57:57.339 --> 00:57:57.639]  I didn't.
[00:57:57.659 --> 00:57:59.879]  I don't have Evo or anything.
[00:57:59.939 --> 00:58:01.260]  I'm hoping somebody out there has got it.
[00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:02.440]  That was Tuesday night.
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:05.040]  Tuesday night, what time?
[00:58:06.621 --> 00:58:08.001]  7pm Central Time.
[00:58:08.781 --> 00:58:10.902]  Will somebody please mail that to me folks?
[00:58:11.162 --> 00:58:12.382]  What were they saying on the program?
[00:58:13.272 --> 00:58:15.333]  Um, I emailed you the transcript just so you know.
[00:58:15.513 --> 00:58:16.294]  I've sifted it before.
[00:58:16.334 --> 00:58:17.254]  When did you email that?
[00:58:17.874 --> 00:58:18.855]  Uh, yesterday afternoon.
[00:58:19.195 --> 00:58:20.295]  Okay, I'll get it posted.
[00:58:20.756 --> 00:58:21.076]  Okay.
[00:58:21.176 --> 00:58:33.521]  Basically it had... They interviewed a guy named Gerald Posner who wrote a book called Case Closed about the JFK assassination, trying to discredit all the... Did they plug Jimmy's... Did they plug Jimmy's website?
[00:58:34.542 --> 00:58:36.243]  Uh, they did mention the website.
[00:58:36.343 --> 00:58:41.125]  They... Pretty much it was obviously a disparaging segment about...
[00:58:43.021 --> 00:58:44.323]  Well, I'd love to get to the audio of that.
[00:58:44.383 --> 00:58:44.723]  Stay there.
[00:58:44.763 --> 00:58:46.125]  We'll talk more about it when we get back.
[00:58:46.726 --> 00:58:47.567]  We'll take your call.
[00:58:47.587 --> 00:58:48.728]  Continue with your call, Robert.
[00:58:48.808 --> 00:58:49.209]  Stay with us.
[00:58:49.229 --> 00:58:49.810]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:58.060 --> 00:58:58.741]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.381 --> 00:59:00.343]  Mainstream Media.
[00:59:00.987 --> 00:59:06.350]  In California, peaceful protests now have US military tanks pulling up and harassing them.
[00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:11.512]  89% of Americans in a major CNN poll believe the government's covering up.
[00:59:29.432 --> 00:59:30.973]  Information on 9-11.
[00:59:32.654 --> 00:59:42.180]  This Alberto Gonzalez character, this Enron lawyer, this pro-abortion lawyer of Bush's, is a guy that came up with a plan to torture people, to strip citizens of their rights.
[00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:45.962]  He told the Pentagon that it was okay to torture, that Bush was above the law.
[00:59:46.363 --> 00:59:47.884]  More on the battle for Fallujah.
[00:59:47.924 --> 00:59:49.905]  Doctors coming on who have prior knowledge of 9-11.
[00:59:50.605 --> 00:59:51.746]  It's all coming up.
[00:59:52.873 --> 00:59:54.456]  But right now, let's go back to Robert in Texas.
[00:59:54.476 --> 01:00:03.673]  We've had Jimmy Walter on, the multi-millionaire, the mega-millionaire, who put full-page ads in newspapers and magazines talking about the controlled demolition of Building 7, the Pentagon.
[01:00:04.392 --> 01:00:06.633]  He promotes my videos and some other great videos.
[01:00:07.913 --> 01:00:12.054]  And I didn't know that on MSNBC Tuesday night he'd been attacked at 7pm.
[01:00:12.414 --> 01:00:13.595]  What's the name of the show again?
[01:00:13.635 --> 01:00:15.055]  You say you sent me the transcript, Robert.
[01:00:15.315 --> 01:00:18.156]  I'm going to be posting that today, but tell us the name of the show.
[01:00:18.676 --> 01:00:20.777]  It's called Countdown with Keith Olbermann.
[01:00:21.217 --> 01:00:22.077]  Oh yeah, I know that show.
[01:00:23.857 --> 01:00:27.278]  And so basically they had on the case closed, Kennedy assassination.
[01:00:27.298 --> 01:00:28.399]  Gotta say it's all not true.
[01:00:28.619 --> 01:00:32.940]  Well, 92% of people believe the government killed Kennedy, so their propaganda isn't working.
[01:00:33.692 --> 01:00:33.832]  Right.
[01:00:33.852 --> 01:00:34.752]  What did this guy say?
[01:00:35.733 --> 01:00:42.835]  First off, when they introduced him, they called him the most respected authority on the subject of 9-11, which I thought was... Wow!
[01:00:42.955 --> 01:00:44.336]  He's just respected on everything!
[01:00:44.796 --> 01:00:45.076]  Right.
[01:00:45.516 --> 01:00:52.758]  And he immediately says that the ads that Walter put up were straight out of the X-Files, that's a quote.
[01:00:53.039 --> 01:00:57.800]  Goes on to attack him, saying that he just kind of inherited his money and he's kind of a bomb.
[01:00:59.221 --> 01:01:03.262]  And then, he talks about Building 7 and says
[01:01:03.871 --> 01:01:07.674]  You know, how it's just crazy to think that they demolished it.
[01:01:07.714 --> 01:01:09.375]  Of course, there was no one else on the program.
[01:01:09.415 --> 01:01:14.778]  Again, no plane hit Building 7, and Larry Silverstein says they blew it up.
[01:01:14.798 --> 01:01:16.299]  We're going to play those clips again in a minute.
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:17.180]  Right.
[01:01:19.041 --> 01:01:29.408]  He goes on, he says, in the quote, he says, the exact details of what happened that day, those planes taken by 19 hijackers, that's not in doubt.
[01:01:31.693 --> 01:01:33.755]  What's not in doubt is that they were government agents.
[01:01:34.075 --> 01:01:39.960]  What's not in doubt is that there were drills run that morning of flying hijacked jets into the building so NORAD would stand down.
[01:01:42.181 --> 01:01:59.055]  He goes on about Princess Diana, JFK, Martin Luther King... By the way, in major polls, the British people believe the government killed Diana, and she wrote letters two months before she was murdered saying, I've been told by Charles he's going to have me murdered in a fake auto accident.
[01:02:00.143 --> 01:02:04.706]  I guess Diana's a conspiracy theorist, too, and then just magically died of exactly how she said she would.
[01:02:05.586 --> 01:02:05.826]  Right.
[01:02:06.667 --> 01:02:24.337]  Then, the final thing that was even more interesting, he said, the host, he told him that he thought that he should be allowed to put ads like this on, and this Posner guy said no, and then he compared people, he compared Jimmy Walters, basically,
[01:02:25.103 --> 01:02:32.666]  He said that these networks would not be putting on an advertisement from an American neo-Nazi that said the Holocaust was a hoax.
[01:02:32.746 --> 01:02:37.988]  So, see now, saying governments lying about anything is equated with being anti-Semitic.
[01:02:38.028 --> 01:02:38.268]  See?
[01:02:38.468 --> 01:02:38.708]  Right.
[01:02:39.048 --> 01:02:42.029]  I mean, that's just how incredible... and Jimmy Walters, by the way, is a liberal.
[01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:45.591]  So, I mean, this is just so... yeah, that's what they do.
[01:02:45.611 --> 01:02:52.033]  In fact, in a lot of the ADL literature, if you believe Kennedy was killed by the government, it's secret code words for hating Jews.
[01:02:52.794 --> 01:02:52.954]  Right.
[01:02:53.334 --> 01:02:54.695]  Well, I gotta get the video of this.
[01:02:54.715 --> 01:02:56.116]  I'm begging somebody to send it to me.
[01:02:57.176 --> 01:02:57.477]  Okay.
[01:02:57.657 --> 01:02:59.598]  Well, I thought I'd just call and tell you about it.
[01:03:01.999 --> 01:03:04.581]  Well, it's just totally classic, is it not?
[01:03:05.141 --> 01:03:06.802]  It was just textbook.
[01:03:07.022 --> 01:03:11.544]  I couldn't believe, you know, having no one else on to respond to it.
[01:03:13.565 --> 01:03:15.707]  There's no other opinion being heard.
[01:03:15.727 --> 01:03:17.948]  It's just this whitewasher, Posner.
[01:03:18.843 --> 01:03:22.244]  But they're doing it because they're being damaged.
[01:03:22.724 --> 01:03:24.305]  Because they're being exposed.
[01:03:25.605 --> 01:03:28.186]  Believe me, they wouldn't even be raising this if they weren't desperate.
[01:03:29.446 --> 01:03:30.006]  I hope so.
[01:03:30.386 --> 01:03:30.847]  Thanks Alex.
[01:03:31.187 --> 01:03:31.787]  God bless you.
[01:03:31.807 --> 01:03:38.449]  Alright folks, we'll be right back with a guest and more of your calls and a ton of news.
[01:03:39.338 --> 01:03:41.559]  Don't forget the website PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:46.923]  I'm going to call my webmaster and I'm going to have the Building 7 section reposted on the main page.
[01:03:47.463 --> 01:03:50.565]  I want all of you to email it to everyone!
[01:03:50.625 --> 01:03:51.506]  I'm begging you!
[01:03:53.493 --> 01:03:55.916]  Are you paying too much for term life insurance?
[01:03:56.036 --> 01:04:00.942]  There is a tremendous price war among the major term life companies, and you may be paying too much.
[01:04:01.042 --> 01:04:02.503]  Consider these possible rates.
[01:04:02.944 --> 01:04:07.429]  A man, age 45, non-tobacco user, issue preferred $1,000,000 of coverage is only $75 per month.
[01:04:07.449 --> 01:04:08.330]  Level for the next 10 years.
[01:04:12.094 --> 01:04:19.019]  Or a man age 50, non-tobacco user issue preferred, can obtain $500,000 of coverage for a monthly premium of only $113.
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:23.082]  Guaranteed not to change for the next 20 years.
[01:04:23.422 --> 01:04:24.003]  That's right!

[01:04:27.145 --> 01:04:30.227]  If you're a smoker, there are great rates available for you as well.
[01:04:30.427 --> 01:04:35.691]  Term Busters specializes in term life insurance policies of $500,000 or more.
[01:04:36.131 --> 01:04:38.273]  So call this number now for a free quote.
[01:04:38.353 --> 01:04:39.655]  800-430-6748 800-430-6748 We're here 24 hours a day.
[01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:39.936]  800-430-6748 800-430-6748
[01:04:54.597 --> 01:04:59.099]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:04:59.439 --> 01:05:03.521]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:05:03.821 --> 01:05:04.361]  We listened.
[01:05:04.681 --> 01:05:09.664]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:05:09.944 --> 01:05:10.424]  We listened.
[01:05:10.804 --> 01:05:13.845]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:05:14.286 --> 01:05:14.786]  We listened.
[01:05:15.246 --> 01:05:19.330]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:20.190]  We listened.
[01:05:20.551 --> 01:05:25.775]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:05:26.196 --> 01:05:27.557]  Again, we listened.
[01:05:27.917 --> 01:05:35.303]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:05:35.684 --> 01:05:39.147]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[01:05:45.296 --> 01:05:57.319]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:57.519 --> 01:06:01.940]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:06.462]  There is a chance to use this disaster with a New World Order.
[01:06:06.562 --> 01:06:07.862]  A New World Order.
[01:06:08.783 --> 01:06:09.003]  Animers!
[01:06:09.644 --> 01:06:13.868]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:13.928 --> 01:06:20.856]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:20.996 --> 01:06:23.019]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:23.379 --> 01:06:33.823]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:33.983 --> 01:06:39.385]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:06:58.110 --> 01:07:10.276]  Alright, coming up here in a few minutes, we've got a doctor who's got more titles in front of his name than the Encyclopedia Britannica, Dr. William Richard
[01:07:26.753 --> 01:07:27.854]  Deagle, M.D.
[01:07:28.174 --> 01:07:38.160]  D-A-B-F-P-C-C-F-P-A-A-P-M-S-P-P-M-C-I-M-E-A-C-O-E-M-A-A-S-M-A-A-E-M.
[01:07:39.021 --> 01:07:39.982]  And he's worked for the U.S.
[01:07:40.022 --> 01:07:42.063]  government, secret programs.
[01:07:42.123 --> 01:07:45.925]  We did searches on him and found out everything he's been telling us was accurate.
[01:07:45.945 --> 01:07:49.888]  He's actually done some news reporting on this before we even learned of him, before he contacted us.
[01:07:50.948 --> 01:07:52.730]  And, uh, he's been inside U.S.
[01:07:52.770 --> 01:07:56.173]  government terror training ops where they admitted 9-11 before it happened.
[01:07:56.793 --> 01:07:59.355]  Just one more of the whistleblowers of the hundreds and hundreds.
[01:07:59.656 --> 01:08:09.004]  From David Shippers, the man that impeached Bill Clinton, to Bob Dole, former chief of staff, Stanley Hilton, to widows of so-called hijackers, to people at U.S.
[01:08:09.044 --> 01:08:11.626]  military bases, to FBI agents, to
[01:08:13.101 --> 01:08:17.062]  Victims, family members, to firefighters, to police officers we've had on this show.
[01:08:17.082 --> 01:08:17.723]  The list goes on.
[01:08:17.743 --> 01:08:18.743]  There's literally hundreds of them.
[01:08:18.983 --> 01:08:23.004]  We have a whistleblower page on PrisonPlanet.com that only has 50 or so of them.
[01:08:24.525 --> 01:08:25.825]  Well, that's coming up here in a few minutes.
[01:08:25.865 --> 01:08:37.269]  But now I've learned that Jimmy Walter, who boldly put ads in major newspapers and magazines and national TV ads, telling the facts of how they blew up Building 7, never hit by an aircraft,
[01:08:38.641 --> 01:08:39.702]  What happened at the Pentagon?
[01:08:39.842 --> 01:08:41.923]  All of this is being viciously attacked.
[01:08:41.943 --> 01:08:43.243]  And we did confirm the transcript.
[01:08:43.263 --> 01:08:46.005]  We're posting that right now from that countdown show Tuesday night.
[01:08:46.025 --> 01:08:48.106]  I'm going to spend a few minutes on Building 7.
[01:08:49.326 --> 01:08:52.408]  And Paul Watson is adding the transcript from MSNBC.
[01:08:53.168 --> 01:08:59.312]  And our Building 7 archive of the video clips, the seismographs, the AP reports, the firefighters saying they were told to back off.
[01:08:59.332 --> 01:09:00.272]  They were about to blow it up.
[01:09:01.313 --> 01:09:02.573]  Peter Jennings saying that.
[01:09:03.194 --> 01:09:05.975]  Dan Rather talking about what looks like well-placed dynamite.
[01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:10.533]  We're reposting that on the main page right now, so there's three things I want you to do.
[01:09:11.474 --> 01:09:18.799]  I want you to mass email out this article where they use tanks against regular tanks with regular troops two nights ago in L.A.
[01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:20.460]  to a peaceful protest.
[01:09:21.421 --> 01:09:35.471]  I want you to email out our data page from Infowars.com, please do this, about Alberto Gonzalez being the architect of torture and enemy combatant designations that you then saw the aftermath of in Abu Ghraib and other prisons.
[01:09:36.833 --> 01:09:40.875]  And this Building 7 that we first broke, I don't know, over a year ago.
[01:09:42.396 --> 01:09:48.559]  So, please, go and re-email this out, all three of those, to everyone.
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:53.922]  There's little links at the bottom that say email this page, or grab all three links to the pages and email them out.
[01:09:54.322 --> 01:09:55.543]  Message boards everywhere.
[01:09:55.583 --> 01:09:59.705]  You are unstoppable when you decide to take action in doing this.
[01:09:59.785 --> 01:10:00.926]  The power of you
[01:10:02.086 --> 01:10:08.891]  Millions of listeners taking action simultaneously knocks the globalist upside the head!
[01:10:09.772 --> 01:10:14.776]  Now they're launching all these propaganda pieces everywhere about 9-11 because they're losing all credibility.
[01:10:15.076 --> 01:10:20.480]  Polls show 50 to 89 percent of people believing prior knowledge or government involvement in 9-11.
[01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:22.922]  They are panicking, they are going nuts!
[01:10:25.944 --> 01:10:29.107]  Before we go to Dr. Diegel, I want to
[01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:38.067]  Play for you from the documentary, America Rebuilding, where they describe the rebuilding of the World Trade Center Complex.
[01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:51.640]  And first they introduce why they rebuilt Building 7 first, because on the morning of 9-11, it was the furthest away, it fell, nobody died, which isn't true by the way, a Secret Service agent is listed as dying in it, along with a firefighter.
[01:10:53.408 --> 01:10:59.710]  And then he cuts to that day and shows the building falling and Silverstein says we gave the order to pull the building that day on 9-11.
[01:11:00.011 --> 01:11:09.694]  Then so you know what pull it means, we play a clip where months later they were destroying the remains of 6 and 5 and they go getting ready to pull the building and it shows them pulling those down months later.
[01:11:10.094 --> 01:11:19.498]  But this is where he talks about on that day pulling it, then we play a month later pulling the remains of other buildings to give you the definition of pull it, meaning industry term for controlled demolition.
[01:11:20.177 --> 01:11:25.662]  Then we play Dan Rather, seconds after Building 7 collapsed that afternoon, saying, looks like well-placed dynamite.
[01:11:26.063 --> 01:11:32.409]  For the seismographs, the AP reports, people saying that they were told to back off, they were going to pull the building.
[01:11:32.609 --> 01:11:34.371]  For the audio, Peter Jennings saying that.
[01:11:36.434 --> 01:11:41.255]  That Rudolph Giuliani and the FEMA Command Bunker in Building 7 was told to get out hours before.
[01:11:41.735 --> 01:11:45.136]  That's all on PrisonPlanet.com and the archives and Infowars.com.
[01:11:45.456 --> 01:11:48.237]  Just type in Pull Building 7 into our search engine and it'll pop up.
[01:11:48.757 --> 01:11:50.698]  That'll be on the main page here in about ten minutes.
[01:11:51.038 --> 01:11:53.338]  Paul Watson, our incredible webmaster, just assured me.
[01:11:53.678 --> 01:11:54.699]  They're in the break when I called him.
[01:11:55.019 --> 01:12:02.461]  Let's go ahead and air this first clip about Building 7 from PBS documentary where Larry Silverstein... By the way, we've called his office at least ten times.
[01:12:02.541 --> 01:12:03.981]  Other people have called it dozens of times.
[01:12:04.521 --> 01:12:05.462]  We've had this out.
[01:12:05.502 --> 01:12:09.323]  You type in Larry Silverstein's name on the web, my website comes up first.
[01:12:09.604 --> 01:12:11.785]  He's never challenged it, never corrected it.
[01:12:12.005 --> 01:12:13.746]  He just keeps real quiet about it.
[01:12:14.486 --> 01:12:27.472]  By the way, buildings closer to Tower 1 and 2 got barely damaged or not damaged, like the Millennium Hilton, and this building way far away, not hit by a plane, catches fire, two small fires, and implodes magically.
[01:12:28.053 --> 01:12:31.614]  So here, and yes I'm excited about this, this is incredible.
[01:12:31.914 --> 01:12:32.815]  This is a smoking gun.
[01:12:33.624 --> 01:12:35.905]  And then this thing magically collapses.
[01:12:35.945 --> 01:12:37.325]  So here's that first clip.
[01:12:38.026 --> 01:12:42.547]  World Trade Center 7 had always been considered the starting point for rebuilding.
[01:12:44.408 --> 01:12:50.070]  Located north of the slurry wall, 7 had been cleared faster than the rest of the site.
[01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:53.051]  And there had been no bodies to recover.
[01:12:57.112 --> 01:13:02.274]  Pelted by debris when the North Tower collapsed, 7 burned until late afternoon.
[01:13:03.363 --> 01:13:05.665]  Allowing occupants to evacuate to safety.
[01:13:06.947 --> 01:13:09.869]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander.
[01:13:10.670 --> 01:13:14.974]  Telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[01:13:16.616 --> 01:13:18.558]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[01:13:18.578 --> 01:13:22.882]  Maybe the smallest thing to do is pull it.
[01:13:22.942 --> 01:13:24.503]  And they made that decision to pull.
[01:13:24.844 --> 01:13:26.125]  And then we watched the building.
[01:13:30.993 --> 01:13:33.454]  Scott is rolling these off the internet.
[01:13:35.495 --> 01:13:37.896]  And because it gets a lot of traffic, sometimes it hiccups.
[01:13:37.936 --> 01:13:45.360]  And with something this important, Scott, we're going to play these clips, but later in the hour I want to play them cleanly because people will think we edited it or something.
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:50.582]  I want you to go back to InfoWars.com before everybody starts linking to it again and you can't load it.
[01:13:51.112 --> 01:13:54.033]  And I want you to re-record those, because those have hiccups all over them.
[01:13:54.073 --> 01:13:55.054]  It's not your fault, I know.
[01:13:55.394 --> 01:13:58.616]  We had clean recordings of it, then it got erased out of the computer a year ago.
[01:13:59.136 --> 01:14:01.957]  We re-recorded them a few weeks ago off the internet, and it's got hiccups.
[01:14:03.138 --> 01:14:05.059]  So go, please record it without the hiccups.
[01:14:06.054 --> 01:14:07.035]  Because people need to hear this.
[01:14:08.776 --> 01:14:11.559]  And again, you could buy it from PBS until a few months ago.
[01:14:11.599 --> 01:14:17.063]  Now the Boston PBS that produced America Rebuilding will not sell it anymore.
[01:14:17.083 --> 01:14:17.784]  I wonder why.
[01:14:18.605 --> 01:14:20.346]  But play clip two.
[01:14:20.766 --> 01:14:27.692]  This is from the same documentary where they talk about demolishing Romanzo Buildings a month later, and the pullet means demolition.
[01:14:27.952 --> 01:14:28.833]  So here's that clip.
[01:14:29.452 --> 01:14:35.917]  By mid-December, the Department of Design and Construction had leveled World Trade Center buildings 4 and 5.
[01:14:36.017 --> 01:14:39.760]  Hello?
[01:14:41.562 --> 01:14:43.303]  Oh, we're getting ready to pull building 6.
[01:14:46.045 --> 01:14:48.447]  We had to be very careful how we demolished building 6.
[01:14:48.507 --> 01:14:54.412]  We were worried about the building 6 coming down and then damaging the story walls.
[01:14:54.832 --> 01:14:57.354]  We wanted that particular building to fall within a certain area.
[01:14:58.855 --> 01:15:00.556]  Okay, so that clip's clean.
[01:15:00.776 --> 01:15:06.779]  Here's Dan Rather, and by the way, I've got this Dan Rather clip in Police State 3, total enslavement.
[01:15:07.079 --> 01:15:10.040]  Here's Dan Rather, set about 30 seconds after it collapses.
[01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:16.023]  They rewind it, and he goes, we're going to go to videotape now, and this is what he says of the video as it's rolled.
[01:15:16.583 --> 01:15:16.963]  Here it is.
[01:15:17.043 --> 01:15:17.483]  Dan Rather.
[01:15:17.883 --> 01:15:18.404]  Here it is again.
[01:15:18.424 --> 01:15:20.084]  What you're seeing are high shots.
[01:15:21.965 --> 01:15:25.247]  Now, here we're going to show you a videotape of the collapse itself.
[01:15:25.867 --> 01:15:27.988]  Now we go to videotape the collapse of this building.
[01:15:31.717 --> 01:15:36.201]  It's amazing.
[01:15:37.502 --> 01:15:39.583]  Amazing, incredible, pick your word.
[01:15:40.524 --> 01:15:51.353]  For the third time today, it's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[01:15:53.975 --> 01:15:56.757]  Okay, now those last two clips are clean, so do me a favor.
[01:15:57.197 --> 01:15:57.698]  Go type in
[01:15:59.002 --> 01:16:05.825]  Pull WTC7 and get me the Silverstein clip again and then just dump that bad one we recorded and get me a claimant.
[01:16:05.845 --> 01:16:07.326]  Thank you so much for doing an incredible job.
[01:16:07.346 --> 01:16:08.646]  He's doing five people's job up there.
[01:16:09.187 --> 01:16:10.707]  Okay, I want to thank him for holding.
[01:16:12.008 --> 01:16:15.390]  If I try to read his bio, it's literally ten pages long.
[01:16:16.010 --> 01:16:16.950]  He's worked for the U.S.
[01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:18.171]  government at every level.
[01:16:18.991 --> 01:16:24.734]  He's now gone back to Canada, I guess, to get out of this police state, but out of the frying pan into the furnace.
[01:16:25.746 --> 01:16:29.610]  And he's written some articles for the web, very bold person telling the truth.
[01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:35.035]  He's Dr. William Richard Deagle, MD, and every other D you can imagine.
[01:16:35.075 --> 01:16:36.456]  I've never seen anything like this.
[01:16:37.237 --> 01:16:43.383]  This guy has worked in cybernetics, secret operations, the list goes on and on.
[01:16:44.227 --> 01:16:46.989]  Medical examiner, just everything else.
[01:16:47.129 --> 01:16:49.832]  It just goes on and on and on and on.
[01:16:50.472 --> 01:16:51.753]  Doctor, good to have you on with us.
[01:16:52.494 --> 01:16:53.194]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:16:53.995 --> 01:17:01.621]  Now that we're speaking on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, hopefully people wake up and realize it's the 11th hour for America, too.
[01:17:02.782 --> 01:17:03.162]  It is.
[01:17:03.883 --> 01:17:07.065]  Sometimes it is the 11th hour, the 11th day, the 11th month.
[01:17:09.407 --> 01:17:10.608]  Yeah, of course the initial
[01:17:12.210 --> 01:17:15.213]  Today was called Armistice Day because that's when they signed the armistice.
[01:17:17.615 --> 01:17:32.087]  I guess I wanted to kind of focus rather than being on too many topics today, but the thing that concerns me most is the story that goes back that I sent to Paul Joseph Watson and I was posted on Prison Planet back on September the 8th.
[01:17:33.389 --> 01:17:39.374]  And that show goes back to a personal experience because it's good to have documentation from people on the inside.
[01:17:40.188 --> 01:17:41.829]  Besides things that are in the public media.
[01:17:43.591 --> 01:17:46.353]  I was an occupational physician for Penrose St.
[01:17:46.393 --> 01:17:49.636]  Francis Hospital in Colorado Springs from 94-95.
[01:17:51.057 --> 01:18:02.406]  And my boss, who is a major, George Schwender, was not available to do the exit examinations on the forensic munitions team that went from Fort Carson to the Oklahoma City Murrah Building.
[01:18:02.967 --> 01:18:09.132]  And when the team came back, I had to do their examinations to clear them that they were medically well.
[01:18:09.755 --> 01:18:11.596]  From exposure to whatever they're exposed to.
[01:18:12.437 --> 01:18:14.799]  Inhalation of particulates, chemicals, or whatever.
[01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:27.789]  And one of the gentlemen that I had to examine had a little nervous breakdown in my office and he wanted me to do sperm counts and other blood tests for radiation injuries.
[01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:35.676]  Stay there, we'll talk about this, but I do want to get into 9-11 as well and your prior knowledge of that as well in a government anti-terror meeting.
[01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:41.465]  Talking to Dr. William Richard Deagle, medical doctor.
[01:18:41.485 --> 01:18:46.551]  When we get back, ladies and gentlemen, and we checked him out, he's been in these projects.
[01:18:47.212 --> 01:18:47.932]  It's documented.
[01:18:48.353 --> 01:18:49.134]  Brace yourselves.
[01:18:56.115 --> 01:19:01.601]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:19:02.022 --> 01:19:06.267]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:19:06.487 --> 01:19:13.495]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:19:13.895 --> 01:19:19.997]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:19:20.157 --> 01:19:21.397]  There are no side effects.
[01:19:21.717 --> 01:19:24.658]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:19:24.818 --> 01:19:26.839]  Eliminate the cost, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:19:27.139 --> 01:19:34.381]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:19:34.681 --> 01:19:38.102]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:20:53.308 --> 01:20:56.869]  Every hour of every day, someone out there is suffering from hemorrhoids.
[01:20:57.190 --> 01:20:59.691]  The pain, worry, and embarrassment can be devastating.

[01:21:08.474 --> 01:21:11.415]  My husband had been suffering from a painful hemorrhoid for years.
[01:21:11.795 --> 01:21:14.476]  After the doctor recommended surgery, we didn't know what to do.
[01:21:14.837 --> 01:21:18.598]  I ordered Hemtab online, and soon after taking Hemtab, the pain was gone.
[01:21:18.838 --> 01:21:20.739]  A few days later, the hemorrhoid began to shrink.
[01:21:21.059 --> 01:21:21.499]  Miracle?
[01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:22.880]  Hem Miracle, we call it.

[01:21:51.399 --> 01:21:52.680]  The effective alternative.
[01:21:53.001 --> 01:21:53.461]  Gold.
[01:21:53.801 --> 01:21:55.062]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:21:55.323 --> 01:21:56.944]  From the Romans through the Renaissance.
[01:21:57.204 --> 01:21:59.186]  From the Industrial Age to the Space Age.
[01:21:59.526 --> 01:22:01.387]  Gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:22:01.588 --> 01:22:05.390]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:22:29.326 --> 01:22:31.227]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[01:23:00.776 --> 01:23:02.958]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:07.781 --> 01:23:08.521]  Think about that.
[01:23:08.601 --> 01:23:10.863]  We've contacted Larry Silverstein's office.
[01:23:10.963 --> 01:23:12.264]  It's been all over the news.
[01:23:12.884 --> 01:23:14.185]  Now national TV.
[01:23:14.546 --> 01:23:18.168]  Both ABC and NBC have done pieces on it.
[01:23:18.188 --> 01:23:19.649]  But Larry Silverstein's quiet about it.
[01:23:19.689 --> 01:23:20.750]  He said they blew up the building.
[01:23:22.023 --> 01:23:46.236]  On September 11th, but going back to, we'll play that clip later, going back to Dr. Deagle, and we have the article on PrisonPlanet.com, where these troops come back, the Colorado Springs, he's checking them out, the ordnance teams that were sent to Oklahoma City, and I heard this years ago from different government sources, but we couldn't confirm it, and now we get into radiation, micro nukes.
[01:23:46.256 --> 01:23:47.016]  Continue, Doctor.
[01:23:47.777 --> 01:23:49.998]  Yeah, what happened is this guy started
[01:23:51.058 --> 01:23:54.681]  Really having a bit of a panic attack right in my examination room at St.
[01:23:54.701 --> 01:23:56.402]  Francis Hospital in Colorado Springs.
[01:23:57.042 --> 01:23:58.723]  And I said, you know, what's going on?
[01:23:58.743 --> 01:24:01.826]  These are military personnel and they're used to being in difficult situations.
[01:24:01.866 --> 01:24:08.230]  The same team was in the Khobar Towers forensic evaluation over in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, I guess a couple years before that.
[01:24:09.451 --> 01:24:13.093]  I said, look, I'm not going to do anything for you until you come clean because I have to know what you're exposed to.
[01:24:13.113 --> 01:24:15.355]  If it's chemicals or dust or whatever.
[01:24:15.575 --> 01:24:17.196]  And he said it wasn't any of those.
[01:24:17.276 --> 01:24:18.157]  It was radiation.
[01:24:18.217 --> 01:24:18.737]  I said, come on.
[01:24:18.797 --> 01:24:19.318]  He said, look, we
[01:24:20.396 --> 01:24:21.537]  Got exposed to radiation.
[01:24:21.557 --> 01:24:22.177]  He said, look at this.
[01:24:22.217 --> 01:24:23.539]  And he showed me this weird rash on him.
[01:24:23.579 --> 01:24:24.659]  I said, gee, that looks strange.
[01:24:24.699 --> 01:24:26.661]  And he said, look, I want sperm counts.
[01:24:26.701 --> 01:24:27.362]  I want blood tests.
[01:24:27.402 --> 01:24:29.783]  I said, look, you've got to tell me the whole story of what happened.
[01:24:29.803 --> 01:24:31.785]  He said, look, you're not going to put my name out there, and I won't.
[01:24:32.606 --> 01:24:35.188]  But he told me everything.
[01:24:35.208 --> 01:24:45.836]  He said, we removed two baseball-sized micronuclear weapons that were on the pillars of the building and a very large C4 pineapple that could have vaporized the building.
[01:24:47.277 --> 01:24:48.138]  He also told me that
[01:24:50.183 --> 01:24:57.367]  The debris was hauled away by Wackenhut under armed security and they were told that all of their bags were searched and checked with radiation detectors.
[01:24:57.427 --> 01:24:59.528]  Now we have video and news articles about that.
[01:24:59.568 --> 01:25:00.989]  We know they have detectors out there.
[01:25:01.029 --> 01:25:09.274]  We know they took it to a Wackenhut landfill, buried it, poured concrete over it, and men with machine guns guard it to this day.
[01:25:09.654 --> 01:25:09.854]  Right.
[01:25:10.114 --> 01:25:14.877]  And in fact, he was told that if he removed any debris, that he would be killed.
[01:25:15.370 --> 01:25:18.213]  And these are military personalities that are our top forensic team.
[01:25:18.593 --> 01:25:20.595]  Basically, that's why they were sent from Fort Carson.
[01:25:21.496 --> 01:25:24.819]  And these are forensic munitions experts for both chemical and nuclear.
[01:25:25.199 --> 01:25:31.025]  And they went over to the Cobar Towers and they said the building wasn't blown up by this load of ammonium nitrate bomb.
[01:25:31.045 --> 01:25:32.066]  And I'm a chemist as well.
[01:25:32.086 --> 01:25:33.867]  That's what I did before I was a medicine.
[01:25:34.428 --> 01:25:36.250]  I was a biochemist and bacteriologist.
[01:25:36.330 --> 01:25:37.511]  I did some research in that area.
[01:25:39.235 --> 01:25:41.436]  I said, look, you know, ammonium nitrate, tell me.
[01:25:41.456 --> 01:25:47.137]  And he said, well, it's one-seventh of the amount of ammonium nitrate that just blew the windows in on the Cobar Towers building.
[01:25:47.557 --> 01:25:49.337]  The entire front of the building was sheared off.
[01:25:49.377 --> 01:25:52.658]  And I said, well, where were these nukes from?
[01:25:52.678 --> 01:25:57.859]  He said, they were placed there by ATF and FBI special units.
[01:25:58.900 --> 01:25:59.600]  I said, my God.
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:01.000]  I said, you're not telling me the truth.
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:01.800]  He said, yes, I am.
[01:26:02.701 --> 01:26:08.362]  And he said, and the federal judge was paged out, and we were told if we ever spoke about this, that we would be terminated.
[01:26:09.136 --> 01:26:15.401]  Well, I know that the BATF told police on the ground, we interviewed them for the Road to Tyranny, that yeah, they got a page not to come in.
[01:26:15.742 --> 01:26:21.546]  Two minutes after the bomb went off, they were in full mop gear, full bomb gear, and some of the bombs did not go off.
[01:26:21.566 --> 01:26:23.528]  There's video of them removing these bombs.
[01:26:23.908 --> 01:26:29.373]  Right, and I want to tie that in, without spending too much time on that, but into the other thing.
[01:26:29.493 --> 01:26:36.939]  In 1997-98, I worked for Reserve Admiral John Hughes in Denver, and we had a contract for all the hazmat for the state of Colorado.
[01:26:37.662 --> 01:26:50.716]  So I did the examinations pretty well, and everyone that had any incidents with moving our radioisotopes out of Rocky Flats or Warheads and our nerve gas was heading usually across state to Utah to either be stored or disposed of in their disposal facility.
[01:26:51.877 --> 01:26:59.405]  And what happened is that we also did the simulations for Operation Top Off in dark winter.
[01:27:00.453 --> 01:27:12.326]  We did a simulation on 17th Avenue in which we had a little mock spray unit with an air pressurizer spraying a mist out the second floor window of an apartment on 17th Avenue in Denver, which is like big canyon walls of buildings.
[01:27:13.167 --> 01:27:23.137]  And the idea was we would have hazmat officers and EMTs go to the local hospitals and simulate symptoms, and then the hospital emergencies were to try to figure out what would happen.
[01:27:23.723 --> 01:27:26.484]  And do a public health analysis to figure out where the release was.
[01:27:26.504 --> 01:27:27.545]  Yeah, that was public.
[01:27:27.625 --> 01:27:31.166]  But, I mean, I want to go back to the guy in the micro nudge.
[01:27:31.346 --> 01:27:32.367]  Did you test his blood?
[01:27:33.507 --> 01:27:34.368]  Yeah, I did actually.
[01:27:34.388 --> 01:27:38.930]  We tested him and he called me back and I told him to go get the other tests at his primary doc, which ones to get.
[01:27:39.810 --> 01:27:41.371]  And those are clear, those are okay.
[01:27:41.431 --> 01:27:43.692]  But he was pretty panicky.
[01:27:43.812 --> 01:27:49.735]  And, you know, I put that on the shelf because it was my first exposure to the really weird stuff.
[01:27:51.048 --> 01:27:55.050]  There's a number of other stories we could get into because I worked in many classified projects in Colorado.
[01:27:56.390 --> 01:28:01.533]  Underground, taking care of some of these various different people working on very, very classified projects.
[01:28:02.293 --> 01:28:05.294]  Yeah, I don't want to, sir, I don't want to get into anything classified.
[01:28:05.314 --> 01:28:06.135]  No, I don't want to get into that.
[01:28:06.155 --> 01:28:08.036]  So, what I thought I'd do is tie it into the 9-11.
[01:28:08.076 --> 01:28:13.358]  In 9-11 what happened is because we worked on Operation Top Off and Dark Winter,
[01:28:14.133 --> 01:28:29.785]  What happened is I met in March 1, 2001 with Dr. Jay Reddington, who's one of the senior guys in our project, with the National Director for the CDC, Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, for bioterrorism, and the FBI Director for bioterrorism, Ashley.
[01:28:29.965 --> 01:28:38.191]  And I was invited to a private lunch with them to talk about what's happened in the last few years in terms of what we did to try to solve our problem.
[01:28:38.231 --> 01:28:39.512]  And this is where 9-11 comes in.
[01:28:39.552 --> 01:28:40.592]  This is huge, folks.
[01:28:40.693 --> 01:28:41.313]  Pay attention.
[01:28:41.333 --> 01:28:41.793]  Stay with us.
[01:28:41.813 --> 01:28:42.454]  We'll be right back.

[01:32:22.675 --> 01:32:23.955]  A new poll out by CNN.
[01:32:25.456 --> 01:32:31.618]  So much coming up, but we are honored to have riding shotgun with us, Dr. William Richard Deagle, M.D.
[01:32:31.638 --> 01:32:33.239]  And we're gonna
[01:32:33.979 --> 01:32:35.320]  We've got his basic bio post.
[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:42.025]  We're going to post more of the articles he's written and what he's said in a section on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com for folks.
[01:32:42.045 --> 01:32:47.389]  We'll also put a transcript of this interview out there on the site as soon as one is prepared by the great folks that do that for us.
[01:32:48.330 --> 01:32:54.655]  But, Dr. Deagle, we've got some time here, so go over how you're already seeing pieces of this working for the government and
[01:32:55.330 --> 01:33:00.354]  Working in classified areas, and then right before 9-11, and you've written all this down and put it out publicly.
[01:33:00.634 --> 01:33:01.475]  Took a lot of courage.
[01:33:01.976 --> 01:33:06.079]  Right before 9-11, you're in a meeting, and here's something very interesting.
[01:33:06.119 --> 01:33:06.839]  Tell us all about it.
[01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:09.662]  Well, I met Jay outside of the conference.
[01:33:09.742 --> 01:33:15.126]  It was an infectious disease and bioterrorism conference at the Adams Mark Hotel in downtown Denver on March 1 of 2001.
[01:33:17.234 --> 01:33:19.216]  And I was talking to him and, of course, I asked him questions.
[01:33:19.256 --> 01:33:25.982]  Did we solve these public health and, you know, notification and event and analysis problems?
[01:33:26.022 --> 01:33:28.024]  And he said, well, no, but why don't you join me for lunch?
[01:33:28.264 --> 01:33:32.308]  And the director for the FBI and CDC are there and we'll talk about this.
[01:33:33.229 --> 01:33:34.690]  And we had a couple of hours for lunch.
[01:33:34.730 --> 01:33:35.831]  We had a long time to talk.
[01:33:36.151 --> 01:33:43.398]  And so I'm sitting across and we're talking about what happened in dark winter and Operation Top Off and then plans for more simulations.
[01:33:44.634 --> 01:33:52.177]  And the FBI director kind of breaks in and he says, you know, uh, there's going to be an attack on a northeastern city in the next 24 months.
[01:33:52.277 --> 01:33:52.877]  I said, come on.
[01:33:53.037 --> 01:33:55.137]  And he said, yeah, 95% certainty.
[01:33:55.178 --> 01:34:00.339]  And he looked at me real seriously, you know, he's like, you know, take me serious now that we're not just kind of having a friendly lunch here.
[01:34:01.019 --> 01:34:02.200]  I said, no, I want you to repeat that.
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:08.162]  He said, look, there's a 95% chance there will be an attack in the northeastern city in the next 24 months.
[01:34:08.502 --> 01:34:08.782]  I said,
[01:34:10.225 --> 01:34:10.685]  Repeat that.
[01:34:10.765 --> 01:34:11.246]  He said, yeah.
[01:34:11.306 --> 01:34:12.367]  He said, look, there will be.
[01:34:12.387 --> 01:34:14.468]  He said, 100% chance.
[01:34:14.988 --> 01:34:15.569]  I said, come on.
[01:34:16.009 --> 01:34:16.690]  How do you know that?
[01:34:16.730 --> 01:34:20.152]  He said, we've been doing these simulations and these other things.
[01:34:20.212 --> 01:34:21.433]  I said, well, what do you mean?
[01:34:21.833 --> 01:34:22.514]  I said, which city?
[01:34:22.554 --> 01:34:23.574]  And I mentioned different cities.
[01:34:23.594 --> 01:34:25.736]  And he said, we got down to, it was New York.
[01:34:26.997 --> 01:34:28.798]  And I said, well, what scenarios?
[01:34:28.878 --> 01:34:35.563]  I said, because I'm familiar, I belong to the nuclear division of AECOM, and I have training in infectious disease and bioterrorism.
[01:34:36.824 --> 01:34:38.845]  So I asked him, and he said,
[01:34:39.970 --> 01:34:42.872]  Well, we talked about airplanes going into buildings.
[01:34:42.913 --> 01:34:44.133]  We talked about suitcase nukes.
[01:34:44.173 --> 01:34:49.738]  We talked about the release of bioweapons in the subway systems.
[01:34:50.698 --> 01:34:53.901]  And I said, well, what are you doing about it?
[01:34:54.621 --> 01:34:57.784]  I mean, obviously, if there's people doing this, you have the capacity.
[01:34:57.864 --> 01:35:02.588]  I know because I work with these projects where you're monitoring everything, communications and everything in the United States.
[01:35:02.648 --> 01:35:05.990]  Why would you not just go pick up the people that you think are doing this?
[01:35:07.712 --> 01:35:08.652]  And he didn't have an answer.
[01:35:08.872 --> 01:35:09.493]  And I said, well,
[01:35:10.279 --> 01:35:11.020]  What are your plans?
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:13.402]  And he said, well, there will be an attack.
[01:35:13.462 --> 01:35:18.166]  And he said, we'll kill 50 to 500,000 Americans and bring in the National Implantable ID.
[01:35:18.226 --> 01:35:20.068]  And I said, what?
[01:35:20.488 --> 01:35:21.769]  I said, you've got to be kidding.
[01:35:22.210 --> 01:35:23.351]  And he said, no, I'm not.
[01:35:23.451 --> 01:35:23.911]  I'm serious.
[01:35:23.931 --> 01:35:24.892]  This is going to happen.
[01:35:25.873 --> 01:35:29.356]  I said, you mean all the work we've done hasn't stopped, isn't stopping anything?
[01:35:29.396 --> 01:35:35.422]  I said, I don't see, since we had our meetings and after all these dark winter and so on,
[01:35:36.346 --> 01:35:48.092]  Any progress has been made to help the primary, frontline, EMT, hospital, emergency, primary, doctor, anywhere, in any city, like Denver, which is... Well, they admit 98% of all this funding is military.
[01:35:48.132 --> 01:36:02.040]  It's bullets, not doctors, as one of your colleagues said a few years ago about Dark Winter, an Operation Top-Off conducted in Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, and other states.
[01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:05.742]  And again, folks, we posted an article, the doctor wrote,
[01:36:06.681 --> 01:36:13.065]  A few months ago, but we did a lot of research on him and he's all the things he says he is.
[01:36:13.125 --> 01:36:19.770]  I mean, I'm looking at his bio here and so much of it is classified that we can't even get into here on the air.
[01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:23.132]  I mean, you are on the record at these meetings in the press.
[01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:37.511]  It is on record, you were in these meetings with these people, and now you're saying all this on air, and it meshes exactly with what we already have learned ourselves, and our own independent investigations, and from a hundred other major whistleblowers, Doctor.
[01:36:37.531 --> 01:36:42.195]  Yeah, it's very disturbing that it's not being taken more seriously by the public.
[01:36:42.555 --> 01:36:47.840]  For example, for my patients, I recommend they all carry a NIOSH N95 mask, which just stops particulates.
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:51.543]  And a friend of mine, Steve Queen, who actually works with the military in
[01:36:52.463 --> 01:37:07.694]  and has a private company in Colorado Springs is putting together an emergency kit which is really important and I'm going to post it on my site which is a banner on your website but it's Nutramedical.com but it's really important that people start taking personal measures because they're not protected.
[01:37:07.854 --> 01:37:10.836]  These major cities, the government's doing nothing.
[01:37:10.876 --> 01:37:15.719]  I mean they came out a couple years ago with duct tape and 100 mil poly.
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:16.700]  It's crazy!
[01:37:17.415 --> 01:37:26.900]  I want to go back to the specific meeting in the Adams Mark Hotel, March 1st, 2001.
[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:39.626]  You're meeting at the Bioterrorism Medical Conference, and the FBI Director and others are there, and you're there with them, and he's openly saying there's going to be this massive attack in New York.
[01:37:40.026 --> 01:37:43.608]  We're going to take everybody's rights, put implantable chips in them right after the attack they announced.
[01:37:43.688 --> 01:37:46.609]  Yeah, they even mentioned martial law and implantable chips and everything.
[01:37:48.133 --> 01:37:51.895]  And then, is this when things finally started clicking for you?
[01:37:52.136 --> 01:37:53.236]  Everything came together then.
[01:37:53.897 --> 01:38:02.503]  Two years before that, in 1999, my friends were in Delton Special Ops, because I taught the course in February of 2002 in St.
[01:38:02.543 --> 01:38:06.246]  Louis with the American Academy of Environmental Medicine and Bioterrorism.
[01:38:07.027 --> 01:38:12.471]  I was the main speaker, and in our class were not only the doctors, but also Special Ops and Delton, so I know these guys.
[01:38:13.058 --> 01:38:19.923]  And so in 99, they were sending the information on Homeland Security, the actual pieces of the Homeland Security Act, two years before 9-11.
[01:38:20.844 --> 01:38:25.487]  This is really... And again, Bill Clinton gave a speech in 93 about Homeland Security.
[01:38:25.587 --> 01:38:26.288]  Use that term.
[01:38:26.728 --> 01:38:27.629]  Uh-huh.
[01:38:27.689 --> 01:38:28.950]  Yeah, you're right on, Alex.
[01:38:28.990 --> 01:38:34.454]  And it's a good thing you're ringing this bell, because the Liberty Bell in America is cracked, but it's not broken.
[01:38:34.674 --> 01:38:35.415]  And we better
[01:38:36.301 --> 01:38:47.050]  Face it, that not only will Americans' liberty go, because they'll use America and its incredible military prowess to crush the rest of the world into this straitjacket.
[01:38:47.070 --> 01:38:53.815]  Yeah, we're being captured by a small elite, and then they're going to be used as the muscle globally to enslave everybody else.
[01:38:53.955 --> 01:38:54.876]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:38:54.916 --> 01:38:56.016]  Who can make war with America?
[01:38:56.056 --> 01:38:58.618]  Who is insane enough to go to war with America?
[01:38:59.339 --> 01:39:00.380]  Who would go to war
[01:39:00.973 --> 01:39:02.654]  Like I talked to the guys in the tank division.
[01:39:02.674 --> 01:39:08.118]  Yeah, why would real Arab countries really launch attacks knowing it would bring down the greatest military ever seen?
[01:39:08.538 --> 01:39:08.938]  Exactly.
[01:39:08.998 --> 01:39:20.625]  I talked to guys in the tank division because I took care of them when they came back and one of the doctors that helped discover the cause of Gulf War Syndrome, which of course has depleted uranium and the anthrax vaccines are relabeled 20 years old, etc.
[01:39:21.366 --> 01:39:27.090]  But one of the guys is saying, you know, these guys in the first Iraq war that were the Iraqis were just looking, they
[01:39:28.123 --> 01:39:32.986]  They could barely see us, and we could see that we just lock on, press a button, and it was just like a video game there.
[01:39:33.006 --> 01:39:33.666]  Boom, boom, boom.
[01:39:33.706 --> 01:39:37.929]  All of their T-70, T-80 tanks are just evaporating literally in front of them.
[01:39:38.433 --> 01:39:41.734]  Why would anybody be insane enough to fight with the American Armed Forces?
[01:39:41.794 --> 01:39:42.834]  Are they out of their minds?
[01:39:42.854 --> 01:39:43.654]  That includes everyone.
[01:39:43.854 --> 01:39:44.674]  Russians, Chinese, anybody.
[01:39:44.694 --> 01:39:57.958]  Well, now we have the video of Marines, they're in Marine uniforms, in actual tanks now, a small protest on the street corner peaceably, and the tanks come up and troops scream at the people with the police.
[01:39:58.078 --> 01:40:01.638]  I mean, they really, these are probing conditioning exercises.
[01:40:02.779 --> 01:40:07.920]  Yeah, it's trying to convert the American military to the National Federal Police, and of course,
[01:40:09.721 --> 01:40:15.064]  You know, it gets more disturbing than that because obviously, what are they going to do?
[01:40:15.104 --> 01:40:20.888]  Recruit all of the young people and turn our entire country into an armed force?
[01:40:21.909 --> 01:40:28.153]  And if you don't have your ID on you, you're immediately taken to detention to verify who you are with, you know, blood samples.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:30.501]  Iris scans and biometrics.
[01:40:46.147 --> 01:40:47.188]  Worked at many levels of the U.S.
[01:40:47.228 --> 01:40:47.508]  Government.
[01:40:47.528 --> 01:40:49.069]  You're in this meeting with the FBI Director.
[01:40:49.309 --> 01:40:50.450]  He keeps saying all this.
[01:40:50.510 --> 01:40:51.530]  What was your response?
[01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:52.731]  And then what were you thinking?
[01:40:52.751 --> 01:40:53.691]  And what else did he say?
[01:40:54.092 --> 01:40:55.192]  I just couldn't believe it.
[01:40:55.853 --> 01:40:57.714]  I got very upset.
[01:40:57.834 --> 01:40:59.795]  I said, you know, what are you going to do?
[01:41:00.536 --> 01:41:04.258]  Let thousands of American citizens die at the hands of your incompetence?
[01:41:05.158 --> 01:41:08.680]  I said, where are the showers for decontamination?
[01:41:08.900 --> 01:41:09.661]  Oh, I see showers?
[01:41:09.721 --> 01:41:12.322]  I said, I've talked to the guys at Fort Carson and these other military places.
[01:41:12.363 --> 01:41:13.063]  There's no showers.
[01:41:13.556 --> 01:41:16.837]  I don't see proper decon facility manuals for any of the hospitals.
[01:41:17.637 --> 01:41:22.679]  I worked at the time, just previously, at Swedish, which is one of the largest hospitals in Colorado.
[01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:28.321]  Where are the emergency push carts for the drugs and the other things?
[01:41:28.361 --> 01:41:33.923]  Where are the treatments for people with burns and radiation injuries if there's a radiological bomb?
[01:41:34.243 --> 01:41:35.344]  I mean, I don't see anything.
[01:41:35.384 --> 01:41:41.646]  I said, you don't even have particulate masks for people if they have particles, either alpha particles or radiation particles.
[01:41:42.356 --> 01:41:43.397]  Or biological weapons.
[01:41:43.437 --> 01:41:43.998]  You have nothing.
[01:41:44.138 --> 01:41:49.724]  So I personally bought particle masks to give to all my patients, which I did over the last few years.
[01:41:50.364 --> 01:41:51.105]  And I gave them to them.
[01:41:51.145 --> 01:41:53.127]  I said, look, keep these with you in a Ziploc bag.
[01:41:53.167 --> 01:41:57.772]  And if something happens, you at least can stop the particles and you can get a poncho and do some other simple things.
[01:41:58.217 --> 01:42:05.561]  Meanwhile, they're giving potassium iodate to all the police and firefighters and federal workers, but not telling the public to get it.
[01:42:05.581 --> 01:42:08.123]  Absolutely, and if they should all have it.
[01:42:08.163 --> 01:42:14.446]  I told all my patients, if they get this potassium iodate, soon the government's going to have it all locked up and it'll be under their control.
[01:42:14.847 --> 01:42:20.730]  And if you don't go to them, you won't be able to get any, but you can now buy it on the internet and get potassium iodate.
[01:42:20.850 --> 01:42:21.871]  Okay, so I want to continue.
[01:42:21.891 --> 01:42:23.352]  So you're at this meeting months before 9-11.
[01:42:25.873 --> 01:42:29.295]  Was anything else said after you stood up to the FBI Director?
[01:42:30.616 --> 01:42:32.697]  Yeah, I asked him other specific questions.
[01:42:32.757 --> 01:42:38.220]  I said, what are you going to do about this and this in terms of... I said, look, we talked about airplanes.
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:45.384]  I said, well, no airplanes are going to go in there because I said, you know, my uncles used to fly planes and I used to fly these light planes with them.
[01:42:45.424 --> 01:42:48.726]  And I said, you can go a mile off course and you'll be taken down by a jet.
[01:42:48.846 --> 01:42:49.186]  Okay.
[01:42:49.706 --> 01:42:51.087]  I said, and then suitcase nukes.
[01:42:51.167 --> 01:42:53.048]  I said, obviously you can see from space because
[01:42:53.584 --> 01:42:56.046]  They can see if there's radioisotopes in every major city.
[01:42:56.086 --> 01:43:01.729]  They fly jets every week over a city, and they can see from space if there's radioisotopes.
[01:43:02.170 --> 01:43:07.413]  By the way, folks, they can see them with the newest ground-penetrating radar that's declassified.
[01:43:07.433 --> 01:43:09.554]  That's 20 years old.
[01:43:09.955 --> 01:43:12.196]  They can see 400 feet through solid rock.
[01:43:12.496 --> 01:43:15.959]  With the cheap models they've given police, they can see 4 feet through concrete.
[01:43:16.899 --> 01:43:17.840]  Yeah, and I told them.
[01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:18.500]  I challenged them.
[01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:19.321]  I said, look, I know this.
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:25.106]  If you're saying that somebody's got, uh, due case nukes in there, I said all you have to do is send the police down there and pick them up and that's that.
[01:43:25.286 --> 01:43:25.806]  I said no.
[01:43:25.827 --> 01:43:29.010]  The ground-penetrating radar is different from the, uh, from the radiation detectors.
[01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:31.433]  They're even more powerful because of the signature of these.
[01:43:31.473 --> 01:43:32.334]  And I've just read the reports.
[01:43:32.354 --> 01:43:34.716]  You're obviously the scientist and doctor that knows about this.
[01:43:34.756 --> 01:43:41.484]  So, so to be clear in your article you talk about this, you just mentioned it, the FBI director and others were talking about planes flying in the buildings?
[01:43:41.864 --> 01:43:44.006]  Oh yes, they talked about that.
[01:43:44.066 --> 01:43:45.086]  Not my words, your words.
[01:43:45.146 --> 01:43:46.447]  Please state it for us.
[01:43:46.487 --> 01:43:47.488]  That's what they said.
[01:43:47.608 --> 01:43:49.249]  I said that's insane.
[01:43:49.529 --> 01:43:52.131]  What specifically did they say?
[01:43:52.491 --> 01:43:56.694]  They said we worked out, we've had simulations in the past and we're having future simulations.
[01:43:57.755 --> 01:44:03.816]  of airplanes being used as fuel-air bombs to go into major populated areas and tall buildings.
[01:44:03.916 --> 01:44:12.138]  And we know they had drills from 95 right through the morning of 9-11 with the exact same drills being run of exactly what happened at the very exact same time as the cover.
[01:44:12.338 --> 01:44:17.080]  And you said to them, well, wait a minute, when you get off course a mile, they launch F-16s.
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:18.440]  What did he say when you said that?
[01:44:19.660 --> 01:44:21.881]  Well, he said, well, he said, we're still doing simulations.
[01:44:21.941 --> 01:44:23.361]  I said, well, look, I have guys that I know
[01:44:24.461 --> 01:44:28.577]  Inside the Pentagon and there's two teams of fellows that can go at a high-speed elevator to the roof
[01:44:29.272 --> 01:44:31.994]  And these two teams that have Stinger Missiles can launch a missile over 70 feet.
[01:44:32.014 --> 01:44:35.097]  And there's been video of those guys on top of the White House and Pentagon.
[01:44:35.137 --> 01:44:36.137]  I remember in the 80's.
[01:44:36.518 --> 01:44:36.678]  Right.
[01:44:36.778 --> 01:44:38.339]  When Ronald Reagan had... Well, what are you talking about?
[01:44:38.359 --> 01:44:40.841]  I said... I remember seeing the guys on the roof with the Stingers.
[01:44:41.141 --> 01:44:41.322]  Right.
[01:44:41.362 --> 01:44:48.247]  And I also said, well, why don't you post guys like that or have anti-artillery weapons like they did in Baghdad in the first Gulf War.
[01:44:48.367 --> 01:44:49.368]  Or in Genoa, Italy.
[01:44:49.448 --> 01:44:53.451]  Right at that very time, they were having the Genoa, Italy summit with missiles on the roof.
[01:44:53.831 --> 01:44:54.052]  Right.
[01:44:54.172 --> 01:44:55.493]  And why don't they have
[01:44:56.195 --> 01:45:01.456]  Have that capability on the top of all major tower buildings, like the Chicago Tower or the Sears Tower?
[01:45:02.136 --> 01:45:02.617]  I asked him.
[01:45:02.957 --> 01:45:06.497]  So every time he'd raise something that there was a scenario, I'd come back with an answer.
[01:45:06.798 --> 01:45:08.418]  And I said, this is really getting aggravating.
[01:45:08.458 --> 01:45:11.559]  I said, you people are going to be incompetent until half a million Americans are dead.
[01:45:11.879 --> 01:45:15.740]  So they were setting the stage and admitting, it's going to happen, we're not going to stop it.
[01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:18.180]  Exactly.
[01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:20.341]  And I got really angry when I said that.
[01:45:20.381 --> 01:45:25.562]  I said, you guys are going to destroy this country by your incompetence and inaction.
[01:45:26.107 --> 01:45:26.867]  Or complicity.
[01:45:27.488 --> 01:45:28.388]  And at that point, everything shut up.
[01:45:28.408 --> 01:45:31.730]  Specifically, what did the director say when he brought up microchips?
[01:45:32.450 --> 01:45:44.295]  He said they're going to bring in martial law, totally suspend the Constitution, and give the national ID to all American citizens and the implantable microchip.
[01:45:45.776 --> 01:45:48.917]  And at that point, after you had this meeting, what did you go and then do?
[01:45:50.838 --> 01:45:54.980]  I told my wife, who of course had known because we have a very open relationship,
[01:45:55.832 --> 01:46:00.775]  And I kind of wrote this down because I wanted to recall all these events to do very exactly.
[01:46:02.336 --> 01:46:06.038]  The disturbing thing was, when he mentioned the word microchips, I got really, really angry.
[01:46:06.058 --> 01:46:08.700]  You could see the blood vessels, I'm sure, sticking out my forehead.
[01:46:08.740 --> 01:46:09.480]  I was so upset.
[01:46:10.201 --> 01:46:19.026]  Because back in 99, one of my contacts had actually shown me the national ID, or one of the different types of IDs that are out there being manufactured.
[01:46:19.066 --> 01:46:22.608]  This one was made by Healthcare Technologies out of Madison.
[01:46:22.648 --> 01:46:24.109]  And they had also shown me the
[01:46:24.736 --> 01:46:25.697]  implantable chips.
[01:46:26.197 --> 01:46:28.999]  They're encapsulated either in Pyrex or titanium.
[01:46:29.119 --> 01:46:32.821]  And again that's because out in Colorado you're working in some classified programs.
[01:46:33.242 --> 01:46:49.492]  Right, and so I have all these contacts and of course what's amazing is they know something really specific in one little area and they want to know everything else you know because as a physician you work in all these different facilities and you know a broader picture than they do so they often exchange.
[01:46:50.092 --> 01:46:53.935]  And the most upset people that I've met were people who were former
[01:46:54.582 --> 01:47:05.029]  Special Ops, Delta, military, you know, pretty high up in the inside that were really disturbed that this is the abuse of the American military.
[01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:07.730]  It's putting people in harm's way without proper protection.
[01:47:07.790 --> 01:47:18.157]  For example, they knew darn well when they were blowing up these chemical sites in Iraq that we had run out of capsules to protect our guys from the chemicals.
[01:47:18.857 --> 01:47:24.879]  They knew that when these shells were hitting the sides of their Bradley fighting machines, they were getting depleted uranium, and it was filled in their lungs.
[01:47:24.939 --> 01:47:29.701]  I mean, I did chest x-rays, and you could see their lungs filled with depleted uranium particles all through their lungs.
[01:47:31.622 --> 01:47:32.782]  This is very disturbing.
[01:47:33.363 --> 01:47:39.285]  They're putting our boys at risk with all proper equipment, with all proper protection, and with all proper backup.
[01:47:39.941 --> 01:47:44.682]  They always pick all the old guys out and bring in a new poor crop of ignorant people that don't know what's happening.
[01:47:44.702 --> 01:47:45.883]  Fast forward to 9-11.
[01:47:46.103 --> 01:47:49.303]  The morning of 9-11, how did you first learn of it?
[01:47:49.363 --> 01:47:53.645]  What did you think going back to that meeting a few months before with the FBI Director?
[01:47:53.825 --> 01:48:01.647]  Well, that day I was driving my kids to Chatfield High School because my two older sons were going there.
[01:48:01.667 --> 01:48:03.007]  It's a couple of miles from Columbine.
[01:48:03.527 --> 01:48:06.828]  And I lived in Highlands Ranch, which is in South Denver.
[01:48:07.957 --> 01:48:09.698]  And, uh, when I heard it on the radio, I couldn't believe it.
[01:48:09.718 --> 01:48:14.742]  I was sinking, feeling like, oh my gosh, I was holding the steering wheel like I'm gonna, uh, I'm gonna lose it.
[01:48:15.362 --> 01:48:21.587]  On the road, I was just so shaken, uh, by the fact that this happened, because I knew that they did it.
[01:48:22.407 --> 01:48:23.308]  I knew that they did it.
[01:48:24.089 --> 01:48:26.570]  And then when I heard it was buildings, you see, because I'm a chemist.
[01:48:26.671 --> 01:48:28.092]  I knew they did it too, but go ahead.
[01:48:28.112 --> 01:48:28.792]  Yeah, I knew that.
[01:48:28.812 --> 01:48:29.733]  I just knew in my gut.
[01:48:29.873 --> 01:48:31.734]  I mean, my gut told me they did it.
[01:48:32.455 --> 01:48:32.935]  They did it.
[01:48:33.422 --> 01:48:35.103]  And I knew it was planes going into the building.
[01:48:35.163 --> 01:48:37.105]  I said, well, look, jet fuel doesn't even get that high.
[01:48:37.165 --> 01:48:39.686]  I knew it had to hit 2,600 degrees to even melt the steel.
[01:48:40.107 --> 01:48:45.250]  I said, oh my god, I know that this was brought down probably the same way as they brought the Oklahoma City building.
[01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:46.811]  That's why I mentioned that story first.
[01:48:48.192 --> 01:48:52.315]  And my contacts since in the last few years have told me exactly what you said, Alex.
[01:48:52.335 --> 01:48:54.757]  You're right on the money on every single one of these stories.
[01:48:55.217 --> 01:48:56.098]  You're right there.
[01:48:56.698 --> 01:48:59.260]  Is that they brought those buildings down
[01:48:59.744 --> 01:49:04.686]  With pre-placed munitions in the walls and in the structure of that building and right down the bedrock.
[01:49:05.327 --> 01:49:14.491]  And then that's why for a month it was still molten metal down on the bottom because of the incredible heat generated and that was what the satellite public photos showed.
[01:49:14.511 --> 01:49:14.951]  Right.
[01:49:14.991 --> 01:49:15.471]  Absolutely.
[01:49:15.511 --> 01:49:19.953]  And the reason why it was still hot is because the hot radioisotopes are still down there cooking away.
[01:49:21.814 --> 01:49:23.235]  That's why five weeks later it's hot.
[01:49:23.255 --> 01:49:25.816]  You know if it was jet fuel it would not be hot five weeks later.
[01:49:25.836 --> 01:49:26.116]  Come on.
[01:49:26.136 --> 01:49:27.957]  It's only going to hit 1600 degrees.
[01:49:30.777 --> 01:49:31.498]  It's unbelievable.
[01:49:31.518 --> 01:49:33.740]  We're going to come back and take calls, my friends.
[01:49:34.761 --> 01:49:36.503]  Doctor, can you stay with us into the next hour?
[01:49:36.723 --> 01:49:37.404]  Most definitely.
[01:49:38.025 --> 01:49:38.485]  All right.
[01:49:38.845 --> 01:49:41.708]  We're talking to Dr. William Richard Deagle, M.D.
[01:49:43.791 --> 01:49:49.096]  And they're going to have more attacks in this country, and they're going to have martial law unless we cause an awakening right now!
[01:49:49.857 --> 01:49:51.819]  Theprisonplanet.tv info is posted.

[01:50:56.298 --> 01:51:01.223]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:01.483 --> 01:51:05.847]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:06.147 --> 01:51:15.055]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[01:51:53.351 --> 01:52:00.740]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:52:01.021 --> 01:52:05.746]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:52:05.987 --> 01:52:11.634]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:52:11.854 --> 01:52:16.397]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:52:16.597 --> 01:52:23.762]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:52:23.782 --> 01:52:28.284]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:52:28.485 --> 01:52:30.986]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:52:31.226 --> 01:52:37.090]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitution.
[01:52:37.110 --> 01:52:38.411]  It's about power.
[01:52:38.851 --> 01:52:39.852]  It's about control.
[01:52:39.992 --> 01:52:41.373]  It's about domination.
[01:52:41.393 --> 01:52:42.354]  The new Attorney General
[01:53:06.613 --> 01:53:16.582]  On the verge of being confirmed, he's the architect of saying the President is above the law, torture is legal, the President is above federal law, that is ridiculous, that is asinine.
[01:53:17.063 --> 01:53:18.964]  That is a complete and total fraud.
[01:53:20.766 --> 01:53:25.190]  That is boulderdash, cockamamie, whatever word you want to use, it's unbelievable.
[01:53:27.496 --> 01:53:38.601]  And before we go back to Dr. Deagle and take your calls, I've made two 9-11-11 films, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, and part two of that, The Masters of Terror, exposed.
[01:53:40.542 --> 01:53:50.546]  And you can get both those videos, and George Humphrey's video, and the other 9-11-11 video by Eric Huffman, and Paul Watson's Order Out of Chaos 9-11-11 book, a 300-plus page book, for $59.95.
[01:53:50.706 --> 01:53:54.948]  Even if you already own some of these videos, get them because of the discounted price.
[01:53:56.237 --> 01:53:56.918]  I don't know, what is that?
[01:53:56.978 --> 01:54:00.882]  Roughly $12 an item, $11 an item.
[01:54:03.124 --> 01:54:05.026]  Get them to give us gifts to wake people up.
[01:54:05.126 --> 01:54:07.048]  Make copies of them.
[01:54:07.068 --> 01:54:11.252]  If you get one copy of Road to Tyranny, almost three hours long, each additional copy is $5.95.
[01:54:11.312 --> 01:54:14.035]  Buy at the regular price, each additional copy $5.95.
[01:54:15.016 --> 01:54:17.138]  Same thing with American Dictators, my newest film.
[01:54:17.788 --> 01:54:19.429]  Get them, get them out to people now.
[01:54:19.509 --> 01:54:21.911]  The people are ripe to be woken up.

[01:54:43.610 --> 01:54:45.191]  Expose the murdering terrorist.
[01:54:45.611 --> 01:54:50.572]  Bring the murderers of those 3,000 people to justice.
[01:54:50.592 --> 01:54:51.012]  888-253-3139.
[01:54:51.412 --> 01:54:57.634]  And you can link through to articles that Dr. Deagle's written also at PrisonPlanet.com and his website right now.
[01:54:57.994 --> 01:55:03.255]  Dr. Deagle, let's go to some calls for those that have been holding and being extremely patient.
[01:55:04.215 --> 01:55:06.316]  I guess up next here, who's up next here?
[01:55:07.930 --> 01:55:09.891]  Mike in Texas, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:55:09.971 --> 01:55:10.531]  Go ahead.
[01:55:10.811 --> 01:55:12.392]  Three points I'd like to make.
[01:55:13.092 --> 01:55:14.253]  Bush is a good example.
[01:55:15.293 --> 01:55:20.015]  People look at him as a savior instead of looking at Jesus Christ.
[01:55:20.275 --> 01:55:20.816]  Absolutely.
[01:55:21.036 --> 01:55:24.137]  And people need to start being heroes themselves and taking charge.
[01:55:24.157 --> 01:55:28.439]  Two other comments is this Alberto Gonzales fellow.
[01:55:29.899 --> 01:55:35.502]  I wouldn't be surprised that with this coming Latin Americanization of America
[01:55:36.628 --> 01:55:46.436]  That we'll be seeing hate crimes legislation when Americans start taking charge against this illegal immigration problem.
[01:55:47.397 --> 01:55:49.558]  Which Bush is for total legalization.
[01:55:49.578 --> 01:56:01.628]  This guy's pro-abortion, doesn't want you to be informed parentally when your 12-year-old goes to have an abortion, when he's on the state Supreme Court, an Enron lawyer, and the architect, the architect of the torture.
[01:56:02.448 --> 01:56:03.949]  But that makes perfect sense.
[01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:16.777]  With this, uh, if there is a future hate crimes legislation, uh, preventing people from taking any action or, uh, information and information warfare against these, uh, this Mexican invasion.
[01:56:17.277 --> 01:56:34.208]  Another point, too, is, I don't know if you've seen the article or have, but when the North American Free Trade Agreement came into effect about 1993-94, Kissinger had wrote a, uh, editorial piece in Time Magazine that, uh, the, that NAFTA was a gigantic step towards a
[01:56:34.795 --> 01:56:37.176]  New World Order, that was the most creative... No, I've got his quote.
[01:56:37.216 --> 01:56:47.019]  NAFTA is a great leap towards a New World Order, and now the free trade area of the Americas, the final summation, and the average American has no idea, and the dollar plunged again today.
[01:56:47.039 --> 01:56:49.259]  I mean, we are being looted.
[01:56:49.419 --> 01:56:51.560]  Doctor, are we not being looted right now?
[01:56:52.020 --> 01:56:52.600]  Absolutely.
[01:56:53.741 --> 01:57:01.743]  What's happening is that they're, in a sense, they have a large, it's like a transfusion siphon sucking all the capital out of America into Europe and other countries.
[01:57:03.055 --> 01:57:10.837]  And it's to use America's military power, and then when America has been completely drained of all of its life, then to throw it away as a lifeless carcass.
[01:57:11.737 --> 01:57:16.618]  That's what the plan is, and to subjugate so that everyone will be under global taxation.
[01:57:17.338 --> 01:57:31.581]  And I can't agree more with your caller, but we have to become personal heroes, and we also have to look to God and to Jesus and to Yeshua as our Savior, because George Bush or none of these politicians are going to save us with what's coming.
[01:57:33.206 --> 01:57:35.247]  Ladies and gentlemen, hour number three.
[01:57:35.667 --> 01:57:37.688]  Only 70 seconds away.
[01:57:38.028 --> 01:57:40.149]  And we've posted the WTC section.
[01:57:40.450 --> 01:57:41.590]  Transmit globally!
[01:57:50.374 --> 01:57:51.055]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.695 --> 01:57:52.796]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.456 --> 01:57:54.576]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.217 --> 01:57:56.077]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.797 --> 01:57:57.578]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.363 --> 01:58:01.984]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.544 --> 01:58:06.666]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.866 --> 01:58:16.228]  Alright, my friends, thank you for joining us on this live Thursday, November 11, 2004 edition, already into the third hour.
[01:58:16.709 --> 01:58:24.551]  If you missed the last hour, we talked to, we're continuing to talk to, Dr. William Richard Deagle, M.D.
[01:58:25.945 --> 01:58:26.685]  Worked for the U.S.
[01:58:26.725 --> 01:58:28.426]  military in a lot of secret projects.
[01:58:28.506 --> 01:58:30.387]  Met with the FBI Director a month before 9-11.
[01:58:30.727 --> 01:58:32.807]  They talked about how they were going to let it happen.
[01:58:32.847 --> 01:58:33.848]  Planes into buildings.
[01:58:34.368 --> 01:58:36.369]  Bring in martial law and the New World Order.
[01:58:37.209 --> 01:58:38.530]  We detailed it in the last hour.
[01:58:39.710 --> 01:58:41.491]  And his bio is incredible.
[01:58:41.531 --> 01:58:42.351]  We've checked him out.
[01:58:42.391 --> 01:58:44.272]  He did work inside the government at every level.
[01:58:44.292 --> 01:58:45.692]  Did meet with the FBI Director.
[01:58:46.212 --> 01:58:48.033]  And now he's going public with all of this.
[01:58:49.958 --> 01:59:03.388]  It's just absolutely amazing, and we're taking calls, and we're also going to get into the new Attorney General, the architect of the torture, the guy that said the President's above the law, the guy that told the Pentagon to go ahead and torture, the guy that says enemy combatants strip U.S.
[01:59:03.408 --> 01:59:06.230]  citizens of their rights, ship them overseas for torture.
[01:59:06.270 --> 01:59:18.580]  He's also pro-abortion, pro-not giving parents notification of their children as young as 12 having abortions, but your child's got to have a permission slip to go to the zoo or the planetarium or the museum.
[01:59:19.814 --> 01:59:22.415]  A lot of our troops getting killed in the battle for Fallujah.
[01:59:22.455 --> 01:59:23.875]  The dollar plunging even more.
[01:59:24.436 --> 01:59:25.776]  Major CNN pullout.
[01:59:25.796 --> 01:59:29.757]  89% of Americans with the government is covering up 9-11.
[01:59:30.958 --> 01:59:32.218]  Continuing with Dr. Deagle.
[01:59:34.459 --> 01:59:35.899]  Dr. Deagle, let's go back to calls.
[01:59:35.939 --> 01:59:39.240]  Let's go to Randy in Florida, then Ron, Marcello, Bob, and others.
[01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:40.120]  Randy, go ahead.
[01:59:40.141 --> 01:59:44.602]  Alex, you hit the nail on the head about Mr. Gustaf in Gonzales.
[01:59:44.782 --> 01:59:47.883]  You know, he'd be right at home in the Third Reich, you know.
[01:59:49.278 --> 01:59:52.040]  He openly says Bush is the Supreme Law.
[01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:54.321]  Bush is above the law.
[01:59:54.701 --> 01:59:56.262]  Sounds like they're making a new Fuhrer.
[01:59:57.143 --> 02:00:04.067]  Yeah, well, you know, Bush, the phony conservative, you know, I mean, everybody that voted for him, you know, deserves a bow and a button and a dunce cap.
[02:00:04.647 --> 02:00:08.449]  You know, they fit right in with Lenin's description of useful idiots.
[02:00:09.031 --> 02:00:11.452]  But even if they would have voted for Kerry, they had it fixed that way.
[02:00:11.532 --> 02:00:12.952]  That's how controlled this is.
[02:00:13.132 --> 02:00:18.674]  Well, the amazing thing is, while the last term where Bush sat, there were 4 million babies that died.
[02:00:19.375 --> 02:00:21.035]  Stem cell research went forward.
[02:00:22.076 --> 02:00:26.897]  All of the things that you just can't even imagine, they're classified, they're horrendous.
[02:00:27.277 --> 02:00:29.318]  Abuses of humanity went forward.
[02:00:30.399 --> 02:00:37.241]  So, where do people get the impression that President Bush is pro-life or a Christian?
[02:00:38.516 --> 02:00:43.478]  Well, Jerry Falwell came out yesterday and said we need an evangelical revolution over the next four years.
[02:00:43.538 --> 02:00:48.881]  Well, there could have been one at the polls last week if all of those people would have voted for Peruca.
[02:00:48.901 --> 02:00:50.922]  That would have been an evangelical revolution.
[02:00:51.162 --> 02:00:51.942]  Absolutely.
[02:00:53.223 --> 02:01:07.289]  If their first alliance is not to the Bonesmen and the satanic cult, but to the Lord God of Heaven, who actually is the founder of the nation of America, which was a republic and not a democracy, then we would probably be moving forward
[02:01:07.904 --> 02:01:10.525]  With grace and protection instead of toward destruction.
[02:01:11.265 --> 02:01:20.228]  All these brainwashed and hoodwinked evangelical leaders like Falwell and Chaffley, you know, they're just as full of hot air as their hero-worship, Mr. Bush.
[02:01:21.388 --> 02:01:23.109]  Well, of course, they control the media.
[02:01:24.389 --> 02:01:25.170]  The regular media.
[02:01:25.210 --> 02:01:29.031]  They don't control the alternative media, which is why they're trying to shut down the access networks.
[02:01:29.631 --> 02:01:35.193]  And ultimately, they want to shut down the Internet, because they don't want the public to know this, because an awake public
[02:01:35.999 --> 02:01:37.921]  It's like the movie, I think, uh, Ants.
[02:01:38.661 --> 02:01:51.512]  You know, when they, uh, they realize that there's a lot of those little ants out there, and if they decide not to accept our deal, they won't be, no longer be slaves to the system, and that's what's coming.
[02:01:51.552 --> 02:01:55.215]  They want to turn us into a new feudalism of the third millennium.
[02:01:55.415 --> 02:02:01.661]  They want to have a new genetically hierarchy feudalism, with everybody implanted and controlled, just like the movie The Matrix.
[02:02:01.721 --> 02:02:03.182]  Why do you think all these things are coming out?
[02:02:03.604 --> 02:02:07.026]  They want to turn, literally, America into hell on earth.
[02:02:07.606 --> 02:02:09.807]  Well, I don't go along with that, and I don't play that game.
[02:02:09.847 --> 02:02:12.148]  You mentioned the NIOS 95 mask.
[02:02:12.188 --> 02:02:13.649]  What about the military M17?
[02:02:13.829 --> 02:02:18.091]  What do you mean by that?
[02:02:19.372 --> 02:02:20.212]  Is that a good mask?
[02:02:20.232 --> 02:02:23.074]  He's asking about gas masks.
[02:02:23.274 --> 02:02:25.075]  Yeah, different ones, yeah.
[02:02:25.395 --> 02:02:31.338]  The two best that I've seen in terms of price is the Canadian and the Israeli gas masks are the best price.
[02:02:32.609 --> 02:02:34.210]  But the military one is very good.
[02:02:34.230 --> 02:02:35.191]  Alright, thanks caller.
[02:02:35.211 --> 02:02:35.952]  Thanks for the call.
[02:02:36.252 --> 02:02:42.637]  And again, we're talking to a doctor who admittedly worked, this is admitted, in top secret government cyborg operations.
[02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:50.183]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.363 --> 02:02:54.807]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.967 --> 02:02:59.371]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:59.391 --> 02:03:00.712]  The New World Order.
[02:03:01.512 --> 02:03:02.452]  Panama!
[02:03:02.492 --> 02:03:06.713]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.773 --> 02:03:13.715]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.835 --> 02:03:15.895]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:16.195 --> 02:03:26.657]  Homeland security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.837 --> 02:03:29.598]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new
[02:03:29.878 --> 02:03:30.118]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:45.962 --> 02:03:48.986]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:03:49.327 --> 02:03:58.138]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:03:58.479 --> 02:04:03.165]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:04:03.605 --> 02:04:10.333]  The Murky Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:04:10.734 --> 02:04:22.528]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:22.988 --> 02:04:27.453]  The Berkey Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:04:27.613 --> 02:04:30.076]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:05:14.657 --> 02:05:14.937]  U.S.
[02:05:14.977 --> 02:05:16.018]  Gold and Silver Coins.
[02:05:16.118 --> 02:05:17.219]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[02:05:17.379 --> 02:05:18.159]  Which are collectible?
[02:05:18.199 --> 02:05:18.940]  Which are bullion?

[02:05:46.622 --> 02:05:48.784]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:49.364 --> 02:05:52.247]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.247 --> 02:05:56.930]  We're about to go to Dr. William Richard Deagle, M.D.
[02:05:58.994 --> 02:06:00.114]  Worked with the federal government.
[02:06:00.134 --> 02:06:02.195]  A lot of different classified programs.
[02:06:02.395 --> 02:06:04.075]  I'm looking at his bio here.
[02:06:04.335 --> 02:06:05.536]  Checked out his name in the news.
[02:06:05.696 --> 02:06:06.436]  All over the place.
[02:06:06.516 --> 02:06:07.796]  Meeting with the FBI Director.
[02:06:08.237 --> 02:06:11.437]  Involved in dark winter and top off exercises.
[02:06:11.998 --> 02:06:14.498]  Months before 9-11 in a meeting with the FBI Director.
[02:06:14.978 --> 02:06:17.799]  They said that the attacks were going to take place with jet planes.
[02:06:18.319 --> 02:06:19.680]  Nothing's going to be done to stop it.
[02:06:19.700 --> 02:06:21.080]  We're bringing in the police state.
[02:06:22.192 --> 02:06:41.198]  And I'm literally looking here at his bio and all of the advanced sensory nerve mapping diagnoses and acute chronic pain investigations, all the different federal and state boards, all the things he's done in research, and now he's writing articles and exposing the New World Order in 9-11.
[02:06:42.838 --> 02:06:48.580]  And again, he was intimately involved and witnessed a lot of this right down at the ground level.
[02:06:49.895 --> 02:07:11.528]  We'll go back to him in just a couple minutes and then we'll get to Ron in New York and Marcello and Bob and Albert and many, many others that are patiently holding and get into a ton of news here about the new Attorney General and the battle for Fallujah and what's happening there, the plunging dollar, major polls out where 89% of America's with the government's covering up 9-11, that's a CNN poll.
[02:07:12.228 --> 02:07:13.629]  It's all coming up.
[02:07:14.341 --> 02:07:21.104]  And now the mainstream media from ABC News to NBC is attacking people that talk about Building 7 being blown up.
[02:07:21.584 --> 02:07:24.105]  Well, we've told Larry Silverstein to come on the show, the owner.
[02:07:24.325 --> 02:07:25.325]  He says they blew it up.
[02:07:25.545 --> 02:07:27.026]  The firefighters say they blew it up.
[02:07:27.266 --> 02:07:35.249]  We have all the documents, all the tapes, all the clips, all the articles reposted on the main page of PrisonPlanet.com right now!
[02:07:37.739 --> 02:07:46.782]  And it's important for you to email it out and post it everywhere, and again, start the news cycle on this again, exposing their lies, their counter-offensive against us.
[02:07:48.422 --> 02:07:51.063]  So, please do that immediately, I'm begging you.
[02:07:51.423 --> 02:07:53.444]  You can have such an effect, it will just take action.
[02:07:53.784 --> 02:07:59.886]  Email everybody on your email list, go to a few message boards, email all the big websites, tell them, repost this, it's important.
[02:08:00.626 --> 02:08:02.707]  We have the power, we can affect change.
[02:08:03.047 --> 02:08:06.288]  The globalists are losing credibility, they're losing control, they're panicking.
[02:08:07.950 --> 02:08:11.312]  Oh, by the way, we're going to be joined now by Debbie Morrow for two or three minutes.
[02:08:12.433 --> 02:08:16.036]  I talked last week about how the water's stinking so bad in Austin, Texas.
[02:08:16.756 --> 02:08:19.098]  And it was in the Sunday paper, I wasn't aware of this.
[02:08:19.878 --> 02:08:23.881]  But yeah, you know, there's some plant life and some sewage in it, but don't worry.
[02:08:24.301 --> 02:08:27.043]  Chlorine's been added, so it's not bad for you.
[02:08:27.604 --> 02:08:30.266]  I mean, it tastes like a port-a-potty smells.
[02:08:31.146 --> 02:08:33.708]  Without going too much further into detail.
[02:08:34.702 --> 02:08:36.465]  I mean, even in iced tea, you smell it.
[02:08:36.966 --> 02:08:39.049]  And people are just slurping it with pleasure.
[02:08:39.510 --> 02:08:40.652]  They're not going to filter it.
[02:08:40.973 --> 02:08:42.916]  And that's just the town where I live, folks.
[02:08:44.919 --> 02:08:47.684]  I mean, now I guess we'll buy anything, so hey, sewage is good for you.
[02:08:48.570 --> 02:08:58.716]  Debbie, people need to call you, not for disasters that may be coming, but just to stop drinking the current disaster of herbicide, pesticide, sewage, dead bacteria.
[02:08:58.896 --> 02:09:04.019]  Yeah, the chlorine kills it all, but you're still drinking, you know, dead sewage, dead bacteria.
[02:09:04.619 --> 02:09:06.440]  It ain't good for you, is it Debbie?
[02:09:06.660 --> 02:09:07.561]  No, it's not.
[02:09:07.621 --> 02:09:09.982]  It's really bad for you.
[02:09:10.362 --> 02:09:11.003]  Gosh, you know,
[02:09:13.013 --> 02:09:18.497]  Sure, Debbie, there's some sewage and dead plant and bacteria matter, but just enjoy it.
[02:09:19.037 --> 02:09:19.938]  No, let's not.
[02:09:20.178 --> 02:09:21.619]  That's perky, our water.
[02:09:21.639 --> 02:09:22.960]  You're not with Al-Qaeda, are you?
[02:09:23.180 --> 02:09:23.780]  No.
[02:09:23.820 --> 02:09:25.702]  Questioning the government means you're with Al-Qaeda.
[02:09:26.468 --> 02:09:30.609]  Well, I hope not, because then I would be in a lot of trouble, I guess.
[02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:37.090]  I'm joking with you, my dear, but tell the folks about the specials, how they call, or maybe they can just trust the government and keep drinking the water.
[02:09:37.470 --> 02:09:39.971]  Okay, call into our office here at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:09:39.991 --> 02:09:40.331]  That's 1-888-803-4438.
[02:09:40.391 --> 02:09:42.792]  And order a Berkey Light, order Berkey Sport bottles.
[02:09:42.812 --> 02:09:45.652]  You know, we have the different specials going, the Berkey Light,
[02:09:55.383 --> 02:09:56.704]  I've got a question for you, Debbie.
[02:09:56.724 --> 02:09:58.466]  Some of the listeners are old-timers.
[02:09:58.947 --> 02:10:00.528]  They still like the British Berkey.
[02:10:00.548 --> 02:10:02.090]  Your black Berkey is made here in America.
[02:10:02.390 --> 02:10:05.033]  They still like the white elements with the stainless steel body.
[02:10:05.614 --> 02:10:06.635]  Can folks still get those?
[02:10:06.875 --> 02:10:10.699]  Absolutely, and you know, we don't want people thinking what they have is bad.
[02:10:11.369 --> 02:10:15.072]  That was not our intent when we developed filters made in America.
[02:10:15.492 --> 02:10:19.536]  We just didn't want to have to rely on a foreign source.
[02:10:19.676 --> 02:10:27.322]  And you've got major universities saying the black filter is a new standard, but the white element is excellent as well.
[02:10:27.882 --> 02:10:29.864]  How much are those if people want those?
[02:10:30.024 --> 02:10:33.767]  If they want to replace the Berkey filters, they can get four for $150.
[02:10:35.757 --> 02:10:40.060]  Or they can get them individually for $47 apiece.
[02:10:40.140 --> 02:10:42.041]  What if folks want a stainless steel body?
[02:10:43.182 --> 02:10:49.206]  If they want a stainless steel body and they want the BlackBerkey purification elements
[02:10:49.847 --> 02:10:51.868]  Just call me and we'll figure it out.
[02:10:52.708 --> 02:10:52.968]  Alright.
[02:10:52.988 --> 02:10:54.889]  It doesn't come that way.
[02:10:55.209 --> 02:10:56.470]  I'm putting you on the spot here.
[02:10:56.490 --> 02:10:58.231]  You are.
[02:10:58.531 --> 02:10:58.991]  You are.
[02:10:59.331 --> 02:11:01.352]  Give Debbie a call right now.
[02:11:01.432 --> 02:11:02.252]  Different specials.
[02:11:02.272 --> 02:11:03.053]  They're all great.
[02:11:03.473 --> 02:11:04.934]  If the phone's busy, leave her name and number.
[02:11:04.954 --> 02:11:05.994]  She'll call you right back.
[02:11:06.014 --> 02:11:06.334]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:11:06.354 --> 02:11:06.394]  808-803-4438.
[02:11:15.098 --> 02:11:16.739]  And the bare minimum is the sports bottles.
[02:11:16.779 --> 02:11:22.422]  They just filter, they don't totally purify, but it makes pond, creek, water safe.
[02:11:22.462 --> 02:11:25.404]  640 refills of tap, 130 of pond or creek water.
[02:11:25.744 --> 02:11:26.744]  Makes it safe to drink.
[02:11:26.984 --> 02:11:29.006]  The black murky cuts it all out.
[02:11:29.326 --> 02:11:30.186]  You can't detect it.
[02:11:30.226 --> 02:11:31.207]  Below detectable levels.
[02:11:31.227 --> 02:11:31.287]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:11:36.423 --> 02:11:49.746]  Or go to Berkeywater.com and tell them what free gift you want as part of the Alex Jones Special, the Sheltering in Place video, or Potassium Iodate, or Sports Bottles, 1-888-803-4438, or Berkeywater.com.
[02:11:50.186 --> 02:11:51.587]  And Debbie, anything else?
[02:11:51.887 --> 02:12:01.709]  Yes, I did want to say, you had a customer call me this morning, and if this man is listening, I don't know his name, he called me and asked me about Berkey Sport Bottles and the price.
[02:12:02.421 --> 02:12:06.109]  If you're listening, call me back because I thought of a solution for you.
[02:12:06.289 --> 02:12:13.043]  So, if you are listening and you're the man that called me about the Berkey sport bottles, please call me back.
[02:12:13.644 --> 02:12:13.825]  Okay!
[02:12:14.235 --> 02:12:15.156]  Hey, Debbie, take care.
[02:12:15.176 --> 02:12:16.216]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:12:16.256 --> 02:12:17.557]  Have a wonderful day.
[02:12:17.697 --> 02:12:18.097]  You bet.
[02:12:18.137 --> 02:12:20.699]  Debbie's a sweetheart, and there are great products made in America.
[02:12:20.719 --> 02:12:24.261]  If you want the British ones, they're excellent as well, and they have those too.
[02:12:25.062 --> 02:12:27.843]  But, you know, they're kind of evil over there at New Millennium.
[02:12:27.863 --> 02:12:29.524]  They have stuff made in America.
[02:12:29.625 --> 02:12:30.745]  I know, it's rare!
[02:12:31.266 --> 02:12:32.967]  Okay, going back to Dr. Deagle.
[02:12:33.747 --> 02:12:36.189]  We're about empowering folks here, Doctor, just like you are.
[02:12:36.209 --> 02:12:43.053]  Dr. Deagle, we're going to go back to calls here, but for those that just joined us, that missed the last hour,
[02:12:44.651 --> 02:12:48.174]  What a sin that missed that incredibly powerful information.
[02:12:48.594 --> 02:13:05.245]  Please, just in a two-minute nutshell before we go back to calls, recap how you woke up to the New World Order, some of the programs you were involved in without getting into classified areas there in Colorado Springs, and then in the meetings with the FBI Director months before 9-11, what you heard.
[02:13:05.565 --> 02:13:06.906]  Recap that for us, please.
[02:13:07.306 --> 02:13:07.987]  Sure.
[02:13:08.347 --> 02:13:12.690]  Well, in 95, I did the exit examination on the munitions team that went to the
[02:13:13.294 --> 02:13:21.040]  Cobar Towers in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and then also were sent over to the Alfred P. Murrah building after it was blown up.
[02:13:21.060 --> 02:13:22.321]  And examined that debris.
[02:13:22.341 --> 02:13:23.803]  There were five gentlemen came back.
[02:13:24.223 --> 02:13:25.424]  They were from Fort Carson.
[02:13:25.964 --> 02:13:30.248]  My boss, Major George Winder, wasn't available, so I did their exit exam.
[02:13:30.348 --> 02:13:42.698]  One guy had a nervous breakdown, told me that the building was blown up by special units of FBI and ATF that used micronuclear bombs from the Army Corps of Engineers that were used for underground excavations.
[02:13:43.826 --> 02:13:47.088]  Those buildings were brought down with nuclear weapons.
[02:13:47.909 --> 02:13:49.169]  Debris was radioactive.
[02:13:49.650 --> 02:13:51.351]  They used radiation detectors on site.
[02:13:51.411 --> 02:13:54.373]  Told my guys that if they removed any debris, they would be killed.
[02:13:54.773 --> 02:14:02.118]  By the way, the micro-nukes stuff, I got that when I first got started from government sources a decade ago when I started exposing this.
[02:14:02.538 --> 02:14:04.019]  And people said, oh, that doesn't exist.
[02:14:04.139 --> 02:14:07.301]  Now they admit they have whole families of micro-nukes.
[02:14:07.981 --> 02:14:09.082]  Yeah, these were baseball sized.
[02:14:09.102 --> 02:14:10.463]  He held his hands up like a baseball.
[02:14:11.075 --> 02:14:14.943]  And he said they were stuck to the side of the pillars, that's why the building was sheared off.
[02:14:15.504 --> 02:14:17.528]  And he explained to me, because I'm a chemist as well,
[02:14:18.027 --> 02:14:26.890]  That the building was one-seventh the amount of ammonium nitrate in that truck up front, the Ryder truck, that supposedly blew the building up and sheared the front off.
[02:14:27.171 --> 02:14:28.091]  He said it was impossible.
[02:14:28.871 --> 02:14:33.953]  Just, he said, just the detonation zone around it, it would have just blown windows in.
[02:14:34.013 --> 02:14:36.934]  But by the grace of God, some of the bombs didn't go off.
[02:14:37.555 --> 02:14:37.995]  Exactly.
[02:14:38.035 --> 02:14:39.936]  Two of them didn't go off, and a C-4 Pineapple.
[02:14:39.956 --> 02:14:41.056]  Two nukes and a C-4.
[02:14:41.196 --> 02:14:42.216]  They removed from the building.
[02:14:42.276 --> 02:14:43.657]  They were non-detonated.
[02:14:44.943 --> 02:14:57.066]  Fast forward to the meeting March 1, 2001, after working with Reserve Admiral John Hughes with the state hazmat teams and the FBI and CDC on Operation Dark Winter and Top Off.
[02:14:57.706 --> 02:15:12.610]  We had a bioterrorism infectious disease conference and the FBI director for bioterrorism nationally told me three, repeated three times, and we spoke for over two hours with Dr. Jay Reddickin, head of the VA Infectious Disease and University of Colorado Infectious Disease Unit.
[02:15:13.439 --> 02:15:19.504]  And the head of the Center for Disease Control, Bioterrorism, told me about prior knowledge about everything about 9-11.
[02:15:19.664 --> 02:15:23.627]  And that was in Adam's Mark Hotel, March 1st, 2001.
[02:15:23.707 --> 02:15:24.288]  That's correct.
[02:15:25.128 --> 02:15:25.969]  Adam's Mark Hotel.
[02:15:26.690 --> 02:15:28.931]  And we had a private lunch and we spoke for several hours.
[02:15:29.472 --> 02:15:37.078]  I was appalled because I'd seen the National ID before when he said they were going to go to martial law and force the National ID on all American citizens and suspend the Constitution.
[02:15:37.798 --> 02:15:39.740]  And I became very, very upset.
[02:15:40.433 --> 02:15:48.716]  At that point, I realized this is all coming together and I realize now, especially with this phony election victory by Bush, the game's over.
[02:15:49.136 --> 02:15:51.617]  There's no more time for playing around here.
[02:15:51.637 --> 02:15:56.259]  If you don't follow what Alex is trying to get everyone that's listening here to do, it's over.
[02:15:56.319 --> 02:15:58.040]  Not just for Americans, but for everyone.
[02:15:58.640 --> 02:15:59.940]  We've got to wake up now.
[02:16:00.401 --> 02:16:09.084]  We've got to get ourselves physically prepared, like filtering our water, like getting potassium iodide, like doing things to empower and protect ourselves and tell other people
[02:16:09.914 --> 02:16:10.535]  The game's over.
[02:16:11.695 --> 02:16:17.938]  And they've got to get these materials into their hands, just like Alex says, you know, buy them, copy them, get this material out.
[02:16:18.399 --> 02:16:26.903]  If you don't do it now, and they proceed with the next step, because my inside contacts tell me there will be a draft this coming March.
[02:16:27.764 --> 02:16:33.947]  They're planning on drafting at least 500,000 to 600,000 Americans for both homeland security and the military branches.
[02:16:34.383 --> 02:16:41.725]  They're planning on expanding these wars significantly in the Middle East, and you have all the documentation, and I agree 100% with everything you're saying.
[02:16:42.545 --> 02:16:50.727]  They're going to expand that war in the Middle East, and it's going to get, we're going to have thousands of young Americans put in harm's way for no good reason.
[02:16:50.767 --> 02:16:56.028]  Not for the American sovereignty, not for American economy, not for anything, not even for our neighbors.
[02:16:56.128 --> 02:16:57.748]  It's just going to cause more destruction.
[02:16:57.828 --> 02:16:59.068]  Meanwhile, the dollar's plunging.
[02:16:59.088 --> 02:17:01.889]  They're putting the architect of torture in as the new Attorney General.
[02:17:02.817 --> 02:17:04.859]  It's just, as you said, hell on earth.
[02:17:05.239 --> 02:17:05.479]  It is.
[02:17:05.499 --> 02:17:08.161]  They're literally turning us into hell on earth, and they're planning it.
[02:17:08.642 --> 02:17:14.066]  And even when we talk about the avian flu, we talked about these plagues, about them releasing bioweapons.
[02:17:14.546 --> 02:17:24.574]  And we did a simulation, actually, using the supercomputer that's up at the, in Boulder, for the National Weather Service.
[02:17:24.994 --> 02:17:28.497]  Supercomputer, and we simulated a gentleman coming from Cairo to
[02:17:29.071 --> 02:17:34.319]  Oklahoma City and the so-called release of smallpox, because he's literally the bioweapon.
[02:17:34.980 --> 02:17:41.711]  And they know darn well that we have dozens of really, really deadly viruses that have been developed.
[02:17:41.791 --> 02:17:43.694]  We'll be right back, Dr. McCall.
[02:17:43.714 --> 02:17:44.035]  Stay with us.
[02:17:46.178 --> 02:17:49.779]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[02:17:50.099 --> 02:17:53.619]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.

[02:18:12.183 --> 02:18:13.183]  This detailed report
[02:18:13.243 --> 02:18:14.023]  We're good to go.
[02:18:46.431 --> 02:18:48.192]  By now, you've heard about DirecTV.
[02:18:48.372 --> 02:18:56.316]  You've heard that with DirecTV, you get a better value than cable, a better selection than cable, and access to exclusive programming that you can't get anywhere else.
[02:18:56.516 --> 02:18:58.757]  But for whatever reason, you thought there was a catch.
[02:18:59.037 --> 02:19:00.598]  Maybe even hidden fees.
[02:19:00.818 --> 02:19:02.439]  Well, Expert Satellite can help.
[02:19:02.679 --> 02:19:04.780]  And we've done it for hundreds of thousands already.
[02:19:05.020 --> 02:19:06.601]  Just give us a call at 1-800-655-0658.
[02:19:06.621 --> 02:19:13.524]  Within seconds, we'll compare DirecTV to your cable bill right over the phone.
[02:19:13.764 --> 02:19:20.289]  You'll be amazed that for only $39.99 per month, you get over 130 quality channels, including your locals.
[02:19:20.489 --> 02:19:22.951]  Plus, when you sign up today, there is no equipment to buy.
[02:19:23.151 --> 02:19:26.774]  We'll install a DirecTV system for up to four separate rooms, free.
[02:19:27.094 --> 02:19:31.498]  So pick up the phone and let us show you how easy and free it is to switch to DirecTV.
[02:19:31.618 --> 02:19:34.180]  Plus, get a free DVD player while supplies last.
[02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:34.580]  Just dial 1-800-655-0658.
[02:19:34.600 --> 02:19:34.840]  That's 800-655-0658.
[02:19:34.961 --> 02:19:35.681]  Call now for complete details.
[02:19:43.387 --> 02:19:43.976]  Conditions apply.
[02:19:46.670 --> 02:19:55.737]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:19:55.997 --> 02:20:07.225]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:20:07.566 --> 02:20:13.270]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:20:13.510 --> 02:20:20.174]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:20:20.374 --> 02:20:27.198]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:20:27.479 --> 02:20:29.240]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[02:20:29.500 --> 02:20:31.561]  Upgrade to Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:20:31.761 --> 02:20:33.863]  Get a two-pack for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175.
[02:20:33.903 --> 02:20:34.803]  Call New Millennium at 888-
[02:20:37.705 --> 02:20:40.368]  803-4438, that's 888-803-4438, or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[02:20:44.938 --> 02:20:47.959]  You and your family members gaining enough minerals in the daily diet?
[02:20:47.979 --> 02:20:50.859]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[02:20:51.079 --> 02:20:58.161]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[02:20:58.341 --> 02:21:01.622]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[02:21:01.882 --> 02:21:03.922]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[02:21:04.242 --> 02:21:12.064]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[02:21:12.344 --> 02:21:13.625]  Either way, why chance it?
[02:21:13.725 --> 02:21:23.692]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call to Sea Minerals at 877-835-5555 and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost to the immune system.
[02:21:23.932 --> 02:21:28.075]  Sea Minerals provides a complete and balanced set of minerals and trace elements found in our oceans.
[02:21:28.335 --> 02:21:33.038]  Reclaim that youthful, energetic feeling and restore your good health with the help of minerals from the sea.
[02:21:33.178 --> 02:21:34.879]  Call Sea Minerals today, toll-free, 877-835-5555.
[02:21:34.999 --> 02:21:35.239]  That's 877-835-5555.
[02:21:42.484 --> 02:21:54.431]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:21:55.011 --> 02:21:57.973]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:00.574 --> 02:22:04.336]  We'll get more into super bio weapons coming up in the next segment with our guest.
[02:22:04.916 --> 02:22:07.838]  Why did the Australian government release the ingredients of how to make
[02:22:08.556 --> 02:22:12.857]  The suggested nomination of Alberto Gonzales is a disgrace.
[02:22:12.877 --> 02:22:13.277]  This is unbelievable.
[02:22:13.297 --> 02:22:15.197]  This guy does believe in imperial presidency.
[02:22:38.331 --> 02:22:41.712]  I guess he would feel more comfortable with a return to a monarchy.
[02:22:42.172 --> 02:22:46.773]  And he believes that 12-year-olds should not have to get parental consent for abortions.
[02:22:47.313 --> 02:22:58.935]  Yes, and along with that, he also believes that torture as a legal matter, as a cornerstone of legal and political policy, is good.
[02:22:58.955 --> 02:23:04.376]  We have links to his memo and articles about it on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:23:04.476 --> 02:23:06.396]  He says the President is above the law.
[02:23:07.133 --> 02:23:09.074]  There's no doubt about the man's position.
[02:23:09.375 --> 02:23:10.415]  He made them public.
[02:23:10.796 --> 02:23:11.716]  There's no doubt about it.
[02:23:12.317 --> 02:23:18.321]  He called the Geneva Convention a quaint document, implying that it was useless.
[02:23:18.381 --> 02:23:23.384]  Well, first off, let's start from the last backwards.
[02:23:23.525 --> 02:23:25.366]  If this man cares less about our troops,
[02:23:25.968 --> 02:23:29.631]  Even if he had entertained such thoughts, he would have never made them come out of his mouth.
[02:23:29.972 --> 02:23:32.554]  Because when our troops get captured, they're going to be tortured.
[02:23:32.614 --> 02:23:33.034]  That's right.
[02:23:33.695 --> 02:23:35.136]  But he will engage in doublespeak.
[02:23:35.256 --> 02:23:36.878]  They're torturing their men!
[02:23:36.938 --> 02:23:38.679]  Look at the torturers go when we do it!
[02:23:39.019 --> 02:23:45.085]  Understand something, that with all these conventions, under the practice of law, I'll try to explain a real complex law.
[02:23:45.105 --> 02:23:46.806]  Well, he even said he was above federal law.
[02:23:47.287 --> 02:23:50.509]  When you do things like that, you understand that all bets are off.
[02:23:50.549 --> 02:23:53.452]  In other words, if you say, it's okay for me to torture your men,
[02:23:54.130 --> 02:23:59.214]  Then, if the enemy tortures all men, we have no recourse to complaint in international law.
[02:23:59.234 --> 02:23:59.995]  There's nothing we could do.
[02:24:00.015 --> 02:24:10.323]  Plus, the Army report says 75 to 90% of those picked up at the 32 camps, 34 camps, were innocent families.
[02:24:10.343 --> 02:24:13.086]  This is the Army's own report, whose papers weren't in order.
[02:24:14.027 --> 02:24:16.148]  Now, that's one thing, okay?
[02:24:16.308 --> 02:24:19.311]  The issue that the man could feel so cavalier about torture,
[02:24:19.727 --> 02:24:22.509]  That he could even feel emboldened enough to say that on the record.
[02:24:22.549 --> 02:24:23.570]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:24:23.670 --> 02:24:28.214]  Mingela hit it, but Alberto Joseph Mingela Gonzalez does not hide it.
[02:24:28.614 --> 02:24:28.854]  Right.
[02:24:28.994 --> 02:24:37.781]  As a matter of fact, the Third Reich, as evil as it was, never did put anything on paper saying that it was part of the cornerstone of their law.
[02:24:38.513 --> 02:24:43.794]  This idiot is actually saying, not only is it good, let us make it the cornerstone of all laws.
[02:24:43.814 --> 02:24:47.335]  This man is wholly unacceptable as a nominee or a designee.
[02:24:47.355 --> 02:24:53.037]  Hey, the so-called Christian conservatives will worship him and say, thank you for being pro-abortion.
[02:24:53.517 --> 02:24:54.097]  No, no.
[02:24:54.377 --> 02:24:57.078]  Thank you for being against parental consent.
[02:24:57.478 --> 02:24:58.438]  We love you.
[02:24:58.498 --> 02:25:01.219]  If you're not for abortion, you are the Antichrist.
[02:25:01.439 --> 02:25:04.280]  Let me speak to... Let me get a comment from the doctor.
[02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:04.560]  Doctor?
[02:25:05.060 --> 02:25:10.181]  Yeah, I'm pro-life, and I spoke in March of 1997 at Human Life International.
[02:25:11.201 --> 02:25:17.522]  And I spoke specifically against abortion and against genetic fetal tissue transplantation.
[02:25:17.562 --> 02:25:19.963]  And afterward, they sent me to a nice talk doctor.
[02:25:20.463 --> 02:25:31.885]  They gave me a two-hour talk and six inches of documentation about torture, about vaccines in Sub-Saharan Africa to sterilize women against human chorionic endotropin.
[02:25:32.469 --> 02:25:38.232]  About the AIDS being released as a bioweapon to actually cause the destruction of the African population.
[02:25:39.013 --> 02:25:44.155]  About numerous plagues that they have at the WHO they plan to release on the world.
[02:25:44.736 --> 02:25:57.543]  All of these things are global policies including the torture to try to subjugate and crush and reduce the human population and dumb us down just like the mercury in the vaccine so we have lower IQs who are more manipulable.
[02:25:57.563 --> 02:25:59.844]  The goal is 2,000 in the schools.
[02:26:00.324 --> 02:26:01.785]  All of this is one whole
[02:26:03.539 --> 02:26:08.320]  landscape of horror that they're doing on us very quickly because they know we're waking up.
[02:26:09.161 --> 02:26:11.161]  Well, let me address this problem.
[02:26:11.281 --> 02:26:13.362]  Let me address something to people.
[02:26:13.802 --> 02:26:16.543]  Well, Alex, I've been trying to get my words out, you know.
[02:26:17.623 --> 02:26:18.384]  Hey, wait a minute, Ron.
[02:26:18.404 --> 02:26:19.504]  We've had you on for a couple minutes.
[02:26:19.524 --> 02:26:21.064]  You've said stuff, we've just added things.
[02:26:21.184 --> 02:26:23.465]  Yeah, I understand, but let me please get to my point.
[02:26:24.505 --> 02:26:33.108]  Anybody who's a Republican sycophant who believes that because they voted for George Bush because the alternative was worse, okay, which it was set up to be that way,
[02:26:33.666 --> 02:26:41.788]  You've got to be out of your mind out there in Radioland, if any of you are listening, to follow through and not see that this nomination is opposed.
[02:26:42.228 --> 02:26:52.531]  If there is a fair and democratic process, which there will not be, I'm sure it's almost a staged event, his nomination is almost in the bag, this man would be filtered out, filtered out of that process.
[02:26:52.571 --> 02:26:57.272]  Now beyond that, the United States Supreme Court has been in session and making rulings the last few days.
[02:26:57.867 --> 02:26:58.868]  And it seems that the U.S.
[02:26:58.888 --> 02:27:02.552]  Supreme Court is intent in tearing down state constitutions.
[02:27:02.612 --> 02:27:05.495]  I think that's something else that should be brought to public attention.
[02:27:05.535 --> 02:27:06.176]  Let me stop you.
[02:27:06.276 --> 02:27:07.057]  I'm going to add something now.
[02:27:07.457 --> 02:27:14.045]  Under Goals 2000, Ron, they now have the state of California going in and taking over school districts.
[02:27:14.325 --> 02:27:15.346]  No more school boards.
[02:27:16.007 --> 02:27:16.447]  That's correct.
[02:27:16.507 --> 02:27:18.890]  And it's happened here in New York City and New York as well.
[02:27:19.471 --> 02:27:20.011]  But the U.S.
[02:27:20.031 --> 02:27:28.456]  Supreme Court, the Illinois Supreme Court, said that if you're stopped on a routine traffic stop, that's not a basis for police to bring drug-sniffing dogs to sniff your car.
[02:27:28.856 --> 02:27:30.937]  Well, the Supreme Court is going to make a ruling on that.
[02:27:30.957 --> 02:27:32.318]  So far, it seems... Thanks for the call.
[02:27:32.378 --> 02:27:33.578]  You got... Thank you for the call.
[02:27:33.598 --> 02:27:34.218]  More calls coming up.
[02:27:36.219 --> 02:27:37.180]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.620 --> 02:27:39.261]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.141 --> 02:27:42.823]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.986 --> 02:27:48.467]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[02:27:48.668 --> 02:27:56.014]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[02:27:56.314 --> 02:28:00.738]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:28:01.018 --> 02:28:10.847]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[02:28:11.588 --> 02:28:15.252]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[02:28:15.592 --> 02:28:18.075]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[02:28:18.095 --> 02:28:24.322]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[02:28:24.562 --> 02:28:26.084]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[02:28:26.364 --> 02:28:27.265]  Friends, don't wait.
[02:28:27.345 --> 02:28:30.347]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[02:28:30.507 --> 02:28:31.408]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[02:28:31.448 --> 02:28:31.648]  That's 800-255-1912.
[02:28:31.688 --> 02:28:34.671]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[02:28:34.691 --> 02:28:35.411]  It's powerful stuff.
[02:28:46.866 --> 02:28:49.890]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:28:50.231 --> 02:28:59.042]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:28:59.363 --> 02:29:04.049]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:29:04.509 --> 02:29:11.231]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:29:11.611 --> 02:29:23.395]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:29:23.875 --> 02:29:28.339]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:30.982]  Get the Murky Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:31.002 --> 02:29:32.823]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:29:34.125 --> 02:29:35.586]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:29:35.606 --> 02:29:36.647]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:29:48.217 --> 02:29:53.722]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:54.143 --> 02:29:58.367]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:29:58.607 --> 02:30:05.654]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:06.014 --> 02:30:12.140]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:12.280 --> 02:30:13.481]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:13.821 --> 02:30:16.765]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:30:16.926 --> 02:30:18.928]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:30:19.249 --> 02:30:26.499]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:30:26.799 --> 02:30:30.184]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:30:30.604 --> 02:30:33.745]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[02:30:33.765 --> 02:30:34.005]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:34.025 --> 02:30:34.065]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:34.085 --> 02:30:35.166]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625 call today.
[02:30:35.186 --> 02:30:36.366]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:36.386 --> 02:30:38.167]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:38.247 --> 02:30:40.768]  People have to understand the constraints I'm under.
[02:31:00.888 --> 02:31:01.709]  I make a comment.
[02:31:01.749 --> 02:31:02.809]  The doctor makes a comment.
[02:31:02.909 --> 02:31:06.171]  Ron, you've got about two minutes of that five-minute segment for yourself.
[02:31:06.832 --> 02:31:08.993]  And you get frustrated because I know there's more you want to say.
[02:31:09.093 --> 02:31:11.214]  The show ends all the time and I've got more I want to say.
[02:31:12.155 --> 02:31:14.897]  We've got more callers after you we've got to go to and give some time.
[02:31:17.238 --> 02:31:21.260]  I'm actually bad about letting folks go too long and myself going too long because we don't get to it all.
[02:31:21.280 --> 02:31:22.181]  So please don't get mad at me.
[02:31:23.110 --> 02:31:27.491]  And I want to take these calls from Marcello, Bob, Albert, Ron, and Guy.
[02:31:27.511 --> 02:31:32.732]  And that's going to be it, because I've got some other news I want to cover about the dollar and this new 9-11 poll.
[02:31:33.392 --> 02:31:44.154]  And I wanted to take time out so that the doctor that we have on the line with us, who's boldly gone public with all of this inside information that checks out, is Dr. William Richard Deagle, MD.
[02:31:44.955 --> 02:31:47.095]  Dr. Deagle, how do folks check out your website?
[02:31:48.415 --> 02:31:51.916]  They can log on to NutriMedical, N-U-T-R-I.
[02:31:52.868 --> 02:31:54.190]  Thank you, Paul.
[02:32:15.123 --> 02:32:17.264]  We've already been posting some of your articles.
[02:32:17.304 --> 02:32:21.567]  We'll post more of them there and make a section that's riveting, important stuff.
[02:32:22.027 --> 02:32:26.389]  Yeah, I think it's important that people get empowered in terms of taking care of their health.
[02:32:26.429 --> 02:32:27.590]  We don't have a health care system.
[02:32:27.610 --> 02:32:28.511]  We have a repair shop.
[02:32:29.211 --> 02:32:36.335]  We also have a public health system that's spending billions of dollars, but none of it's to try to protect Americans against radiological or biological bombs.
[02:32:36.975 --> 02:32:38.776]  And just simple things like filtering your water.
[02:32:39.237 --> 02:32:41.478]  You had your expert on the Berkeley system.
[02:32:41.998 --> 02:32:43.239]  Water filtration is important.
[02:32:44.203 --> 02:32:48.785]  One quarter of all the schoolyards have excessive lead in the schoolyard dust.
[02:32:49.806 --> 02:32:55.948]  The water supplies in America are contaminated with chloramines and fluoramines, and chloride and fluoride are not good for your body.
[02:32:55.968 --> 02:32:58.570]  So you're already going to get so many toxins from food in the air.
[02:32:58.850 --> 02:32:59.030]  Exactly.
[02:32:59.050 --> 02:33:05.413]  Cutting out the bad water, which is 70% of your intake, that is going to really reduce that.
[02:33:06.053 --> 02:33:06.573]  Exactly.
[02:33:06.893 --> 02:33:07.954]  I'm writing a book.
[02:33:07.994 --> 02:33:08.834]  It's an e-book.
[02:33:09.294 --> 02:33:10.795]  I'll be posting it up my site free.
[02:33:11.480 --> 02:33:16.144]  And it's called Molecular Holocaust, and it's all the toxins in your environment that people have no idea.
[02:33:16.184 --> 02:33:20.248]  I belong to the Academy of Environmental Medicine, and we know just how dangerous it is.
[02:33:20.748 --> 02:33:39.104]  There's a jet stream bringing over in the southern hemisphere, and it comes across the Gulf of Mexico and dumps on America, all over North America, a hundred thousand tons of heavy metals and chemicals every month from garbage that's being burnt in the areas in North Africa and Asia and all the way across through China.
[02:33:39.898 --> 02:33:41.339]  This is dumping every month.
[02:33:41.839 --> 02:33:42.940]  And that's just in dust.
[02:33:42.980 --> 02:33:44.421]  Hundreds of a micron in size.
[02:33:44.701 --> 02:33:46.342]  Yeah, well I talked to my grandmother.
[02:33:46.362 --> 02:33:48.543]  She was raised and lives here in Austin.
[02:33:48.983 --> 02:33:52.885]  All these old people, they never had allergies until about ten years ago.
[02:33:53.606 --> 02:33:54.626]  Allergies were unknown.
[02:33:54.706 --> 02:33:56.928]  It's not just the pollen and all this stuff.
[02:33:57.848 --> 02:33:59.109]  You're right.
[02:33:59.209 --> 02:34:01.510]  Texas is just hit by this jet stream.
[02:34:01.810 --> 02:34:06.313]  It's coming right up the Gulf and it's dumping it right on Texas and heads straight north to America.
[02:34:07.009 --> 02:34:11.751]  And no one's telling you that the mercury is dangerous, or the lead, or all the other chemicals.
[02:34:12.272 --> 02:34:16.874]  And now if you do sampling of people's blood, in fact I'll be putting links on there to toxicology labs,
[02:34:17.301 --> 02:34:19.502]  The industries aren't telling people they're in danger?
[02:34:19.522 --> 02:34:20.342]  The military troops?
[02:34:20.902 --> 02:34:25.564]  Our troops were exposed to the things to kill, the Leishmaniasis.
[02:34:25.584 --> 02:34:39.330]  By the way, we can't burn batteries here, but when you put them in, they get shipped to Mexico, where they burn them, and then one-third of the children born in Mexico City have the disorder where they have the mal-deformed brain?
[02:34:39.350 --> 02:34:39.930]  Right.
[02:34:40.350 --> 02:34:44.712]  Cadmium poisoning is the primary heavy metal there.
[02:34:45.516 --> 02:34:50.461]  It's just, it's horrendous and this is going to have dramatic effects.
[02:34:50.561 --> 02:35:00.090]  Our cancer rates, when I went to medical school 31 years ago, our cancer rates now are six times higher in North America than they were when I went to school.
[02:35:00.740 --> 02:35:01.280]  Six times higher.
[02:35:01.300 --> 02:35:01.921]  Six hundred percent.
[02:35:01.941 --> 02:35:02.942]  Hey, but that's not important.
[02:35:02.962 --> 02:35:04.983]  What about the Colby Bryant case?
[02:35:05.003 --> 02:35:09.286]  Or maybe the guy who might have killed his girlfriend?
[02:35:09.887 --> 02:35:11.848]  That other guy, Lacey Peterson.
[02:35:11.888 --> 02:35:14.951]  Well, let's talk about... How about the World Series, Bubba?
[02:35:14.971 --> 02:35:16.192]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:35:16.332 --> 02:35:17.673]  Let's take some calls quickly here.
[02:35:17.913 --> 02:35:19.394]  Quickly callers, just bam bam bam.
[02:35:20.155 --> 02:35:21.295]  Marcello in Canada.
[02:35:21.335 --> 02:35:21.716]  Go ahead.
[02:35:21.756 --> 02:35:22.496]  You've got the floor.
[02:35:24.478 --> 02:35:24.938]  Hello, Alex.
[02:35:25.018 --> 02:35:27.360]  I called in today to report that
[02:35:27.871 --> 02:35:38.717]  I observed for myself the first time the mass main mind manipulation media breached the silence on the 9-11 conspiracy.
[02:35:39.938 --> 02:35:49.443]  Not only as I learned the same as you did on Tuesday on MSNBC, but I saw it on CNN yesterday.
[02:35:50.183 --> 02:35:51.604]  There was, you know, 9-11 conspiracy and
[02:35:54.397 --> 02:36:03.221]  The thing to bear in mind is I turned it on CNN mid-sequence, so I missed the part where they introduced the fellow, but it sounds very much like it was the same person.
[02:36:03.361 --> 02:36:16.226]  But after they demonized that you're all kooks and you believe the government was involved, they did a poll and 89% when they closed the poll, 4,000 plus respondents to 500 believe the government was doing this.
[02:36:16.266 --> 02:36:19.668]  So, despite your propaganda, it didn't work too well for you, did it?
[02:36:20.768 --> 02:36:22.189]  No, the jig's up.
[02:36:23.479 --> 02:36:28.142]  Basically, I mean, it's just for people to take a look at, at this point.
[02:36:28.922 --> 02:36:39.008]  Yeah, by and large, I'm finding when I speak to people in Canada, they're much less been brainwashed because they don't worship Emperor Bush, the boy Emperor.
[02:36:39.969 --> 02:36:45.312]  And they are aware that something really terrible is happening, and they're a big neighbor to the South.
[02:36:46.913 --> 02:36:49.455]  Alright, anything else, Marcello?
[02:36:50.355 --> 02:36:52.997]  Well, I was just going to comment on the way they formatted the show
[02:36:53.693 --> 02:37:03.423]  The well-put-together government show there, he always had a chance to refute the individual's points, but he couldn't.
[02:37:03.643 --> 02:37:06.946]  And they decide to refute sub-points or points no one even made.
[02:37:08.267 --> 02:37:08.548]  Yeah.
[02:37:09.429 --> 02:37:15.875]  They just have all their side-issue distraction techniques and getting you off the main point.
[02:37:17.498 --> 02:37:19.199]  Well, they don't want this even opened up.
[02:37:19.279 --> 02:37:20.859]  This is a desperation tactic.
[02:37:20.899 --> 02:37:21.480]  Finish the call.
[02:37:21.740 --> 02:37:25.361]  If somebody's got that CNN piece, please email it to us or mail it to me.
[02:37:25.401 --> 02:37:27.542]  We'll get it out there, folks, and we'll decipher it.
[02:37:28.542 --> 02:37:31.384]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Bob in Texas.
[02:37:31.444 --> 02:37:32.284]  Bob, go ahead.
[02:37:33.384 --> 02:37:33.604]  Hello?
[02:37:34.025 --> 02:37:34.365]  Yes, sir.
[02:37:34.705 --> 02:37:36.746]  Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:37:36.966 --> 02:37:42.148]  I have a quote from Carl Young that I think fits what's going on with the mass mind today.
[02:37:42.208 --> 02:37:44.709]  He said, the foundation of all mental illness
[02:37:45.433 --> 02:37:48.715]  is the unwillingness to experience legitimate suffering.
[02:37:49.155 --> 02:37:51.817]  People just don't want to face reality because it's too painful.
[02:37:51.837 --> 02:37:53.538]  They would rather stick their head in the sand.
[02:37:53.818 --> 02:37:57.540]  Yeah, I don't agree with a lot of the teachings of Carl Jung, but that one is true.
[02:37:57.560 --> 02:38:03.084]  You know, the foundation of all mental illness is the denial, you know, refusing to have legitimate suffering.
[02:38:03.364 --> 02:38:14.951]  When you just are in denial, when you're in a stagnant position, when you just deny everything and have this disassociative disorder, where you see something threatening so you just deny it and move on, that's double think.
[02:38:15.894 --> 02:38:16.875]  I'd like to ask Dr. Diegel if...
[02:38:33.444 --> 02:38:35.666]  What do you think is really behind this New World Order?
[02:38:35.706 --> 02:38:38.368]  There's a deep core to it.
[02:38:38.448 --> 02:38:40.029]  I'm sure you've done research into it.
[02:38:40.089 --> 02:38:44.732]  Well, it's elitism, it's dehumanization, it's domination, it's a bunch of sociopathic control freaks, doctor!
[02:38:44.812 --> 02:38:45.953]  Isn't it Lucifer?
[02:38:46.173 --> 02:38:47.194]  And who is Lucifer?
[02:38:47.494 --> 02:38:49.796]  Is he a real entity or is he a spirit or what?
[02:38:50.677 --> 02:38:57.882]  Well, I think what you need to do is that the Judeo-Christian belief system gives us the answer.
[02:38:58.382 --> 02:39:00.223]  And the fact is we do have the answer.
[02:39:00.263 --> 02:39:00.844]  The answer is
[02:39:01.451 --> 02:39:11.217]  This very powerful, very intelligent spiritual entity has been around for untold a period of time and has intruded on human history and has caused unbelievable destruction.
[02:39:11.237 --> 02:39:13.698]  And what's coming, literally, is hell on earth.
[02:39:14.639 --> 02:39:16.760]  We're not talking about hell on hell, we're talking about hell on earth.
[02:39:17.181 --> 02:39:29.448]  And, you know, there are evil people who have accepted the domination of this creature and its principalities and powers, which are both in the spiritual realm and the physical.
[02:39:29.972 --> 02:39:34.053]  Just look at people like the people that go to Bohemia.
[02:39:34.093 --> 02:39:38.735]  Bohemian Grove is a perfect example of human beings that worship Luciferian entities.
[02:39:38.775 --> 02:39:39.395]  These are real.
[02:39:39.675 --> 02:39:40.975]  Child sacrifice is real.
[02:39:41.976 --> 02:39:51.698]  You know, if you're the... and you see the ritual sacrifices come in, you have to diagnose them as dead and they've had things done to them that I won't mention on the radio.
[02:39:51.718 --> 02:39:53.239]  This is not imaginary.
[02:39:53.259 --> 02:39:53.739]  This is real.
[02:39:54.699 --> 02:39:56.900]  Lucifer himself must be real and tangible.
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:03.742]  Absolutely, and I think the thing is we need to get our pastors and our ministers back to the real.
[02:40:04.002 --> 02:40:06.383]  Hell is hot.
[02:40:06.403 --> 02:40:11.244]  There are real consequences in the physical realm as well as the spiritual for being blind.
[02:40:11.404 --> 02:40:11.764]  That's right.
[02:40:11.784 --> 02:40:14.545]  There's a lot of children who are murdered and I've talked to police.
[02:40:14.565 --> 02:40:20.187]  They're told to not tell the press it was a ritual, quote, because we're doing an investigation, but it's never brought out.
[02:40:20.227 --> 02:40:20.807]  Thanks for the call.
[02:40:21.525 --> 02:40:21.825]  Bob.
[02:40:22.485 --> 02:40:23.546]  Albert in Colorado.
[02:40:23.666 --> 02:40:24.506]  Albert, you're on the air.
[02:40:24.566 --> 02:40:25.007]  Go ahead.
[02:40:27.388 --> 02:40:28.148]  Albert, go ahead.
[02:40:28.748 --> 02:40:29.048]  Hello?
[02:40:29.408 --> 02:40:29.709]  Yes.
[02:40:30.549 --> 02:40:41.213]  After the Oklahoma City bombing, there were reports that containers marked culminate of mercury were found in the basement of the Murrah building.
[02:40:41.233 --> 02:40:42.934]  Do you know anything about that?
[02:40:43.594 --> 02:40:47.056]  I don't know about the mercury, but I know inside the building, all the records for Agent Orange
[02:40:47.762 --> 02:40:48.242]  For the U.S.
[02:40:48.282 --> 02:40:53.704]  government, we're in the building and in fact this officer that I talked to told me all the records were destroyed.
[02:40:55.845 --> 02:40:56.405]  Okay, thank you.
[02:40:56.885 --> 02:40:57.365]  Oh, you're welcome.
[02:40:57.425 --> 02:40:58.526]  Thanks for the call, Albert.
[02:40:58.666 --> 02:40:59.786]  Ron in Oklahoma.
[02:40:59.866 --> 02:41:00.747]  Ron, you're on the air.
[02:41:00.827 --> 02:41:01.327]  Go ahead.
[02:41:01.747 --> 02:41:03.908]  Doctor, I'm here in Oklahoma City.
[02:41:05.108 --> 02:41:07.689]  Right after the Murrow bombing, I went down to look at the building.
[02:41:07.789 --> 02:41:09.390]  I talked to some other visitors.
[02:41:09.450 --> 02:41:12.571]  My conversation was overheard by someone in law enforcement.
[02:41:12.611 --> 02:41:16.032]  I was telling them the whole thing seemed fishy to me, didn't add up.
[02:41:16.618 --> 02:41:20.800]  Within two days, my phone was tapped, my mail was intercepted, I was being followed around.
[02:41:21.641 --> 02:41:25.543]  I had a friend of a friend who happened to be in law enforcement looking into the situation.
[02:41:25.583 --> 02:41:37.850]  Word came back to me that I was on everybody's desk list and that the law enforcement officer got called on the carpet, wanted to know why his superior asked him why he was asking questions.
[02:41:38.670 --> 02:41:41.191]  Is this consistent with what you know about the Merle bombing?
[02:41:41.712 --> 02:41:42.212]  Absolutely.
[02:41:42.272 --> 02:41:43.413]  I have many stories.
[02:41:43.433 --> 02:41:45.674]  You could spend hours talking about the people that I've talked to.
[02:41:46.249 --> 02:41:52.838]  Some of them are in Oklahoma City that have contacted me and have talked to me in military that have told me the same kinds of stories.
[02:41:52.898 --> 02:42:00.349]  They've been harassed because they even saw it on the news that there was more than one bomb and that they were not exploded, they were moved from the building afterwards.
[02:42:01.852 --> 02:42:04.634]  This is something that's totally consistent with everything that I've seen.
[02:42:04.654 --> 02:42:08.557]  Don't come to police officers' houses, the FBI, and go, you didn't see that on Channel 4.
[02:42:08.958 --> 02:42:09.698]  That doesn't exist.
[02:42:09.758 --> 02:42:10.659]  Are you with the terrorists?
[02:42:11.059 --> 02:42:17.204]  I've interviewed detectives who would ask questions and the FBI would come and say, you never saw that on TV.
[02:42:17.324 --> 02:42:18.685]  You know?
[02:42:18.745 --> 02:42:19.606]  Are you crazy?
[02:42:19.846 --> 02:42:21.367]  We have the video, folks.
[02:42:21.407 --> 02:42:22.388]  It's in Road to Tyranny.
[02:42:22.949 --> 02:42:25.371]  There for a while I thought I was crazy.
[02:42:25.471 --> 02:42:27.452]  I really appreciate what you're having to say.
[02:42:28.740 --> 02:42:34.524]  I've known for a long time there was really something going on, but hearing you today, it really helps out a lot.
[02:42:34.564 --> 02:42:36.104]  I've been through a lot in the last 10 years.
[02:42:37.065 --> 02:42:38.026]  Well, that's good.
[02:42:38.286 --> 02:42:43.709]  The most important thing is keep speaking up, because if we don't speak up now, pretty soon we'll be silenced for good.
[02:42:43.929 --> 02:42:46.731]  Doc, the more they harass me, the better I get.
[02:42:46.751 --> 02:42:51.674]  The more I talk, the more of Alex's videos I pass out, and the more I harass them.
[02:42:54.947 --> 02:42:56.088]  I appreciate it.
[02:42:56.529 --> 02:42:57.710]  We have the people.
[02:42:57.790 --> 02:42:59.571]  We have the force to take action.
[02:42:59.732 --> 02:43:01.593]  We have the power with God's help.
[02:43:02.354 --> 02:43:03.995]  God helps those that help themselves.
[02:43:04.036 --> 02:43:04.756]  We don't have a choice.
[02:43:04.776 --> 02:43:05.957]  They're going to carry this stuff out.
[02:43:06.378 --> 02:43:08.820]  All we can do is try to expose them, and that's happened!
[02:43:08.840 --> 02:43:08.820]  89%!
[02:43:10.081 --> 02:43:17.428]  CNN runs a demonization piece, runs a poll, and 89% respond and say we believe the government did it.
[02:43:18.007 --> 02:43:21.530]  Well, I want to make a comment about who you are, Alex.
[02:43:21.630 --> 02:43:22.430]  You're like Gideon.
[02:43:22.490 --> 02:43:30.836]  You're the guy that says, I want an army of 300 that laugh the water up like a dog and are looking forward and don't have their head down in the water trying to get more water in their mouth.
[02:43:31.437 --> 02:43:33.859]  They're looking forward to what's coming.
[02:43:34.419 --> 02:43:35.660]  And that's, he said, I only want these 300.
[02:43:36.140 --> 02:43:37.941]  You other guys, you go home back to your wives.
[02:43:38.282 --> 02:43:44.446]  I want people who actually will stand up and know that they're physically and their jobs and everything are in danger.
[02:43:44.947 --> 02:43:46.728]  That'll stand up no matter what now.
[02:43:47.631 --> 02:43:50.472]  Because if you don't stand up now, there won't be any standing up.
[02:43:50.632 --> 02:43:54.673]  Well, that's a good analogy for everybody that's taking action like yourself as well, Doctor.
[02:43:55.013 --> 02:44:01.875]  Gideon took thousands out by the river and those that stuck their heads in and didn't look out and didn't watch out and weren't aware, he didn't want them.
[02:44:02.435 --> 02:44:03.095]  He doesn't want them.
[02:44:03.175 --> 02:44:06.476]  He says, go home, you're just going to get in the way of the battle.
[02:44:07.560 --> 02:44:16.982]  Yeah, so the spectators that want to laugh at this and joke about this, you don't even know what it means to have a plunging dollar, what the face scanning cameras mean, what the open borders mean, what the free trade area of the Americas is.
[02:44:17.202 --> 02:44:19.183]  You don't know what all of this is doing to you.
[02:44:19.583 --> 02:44:20.323]  You don't want to know.
[02:44:20.343 --> 02:44:21.263]  You want to deny it.
[02:44:21.343 --> 02:44:23.984]  You don't want to know that we brought the Nazis over here to set everything up.
[02:44:24.304 --> 02:44:26.064]  You don't want to know about Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:44:26.084 --> 02:44:26.684]  You don't want to know.
[02:44:27.004 --> 02:44:27.364]  Fine!
[02:44:27.444 --> 02:44:28.505]  Stick your head in the water.
[02:44:29.365 --> 02:44:30.205]  Let's go ahead and
[02:44:31.351 --> 02:44:32.291]  Take a final call.
[02:44:32.391 --> 02:44:35.873]  Guy in Deutschland, an American calling from Germany.
[02:44:35.913 --> 02:44:36.573]  Welcome, Guy.
[02:44:37.113 --> 02:44:37.894]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:44:37.974 --> 02:44:39.014]  I'm one of your subscribers.
[02:44:39.094 --> 02:44:41.395]  I listen to your show through the internet.
[02:44:41.415 --> 02:44:52.640]  Yeah, I just want to report to you that I watched the election here from Germany and I was watching the German media and pretty much everyone is awestruck that Bush was re-elected.
[02:44:52.660 --> 02:44:55.941]  You know, maybe we got fooled the first time, but the second time
[02:44:56.556 --> 02:45:10.864]  We knew what we were getting into, and we re-elected him anyway, and I think we've lost all credibility in the world, and I think, you know, all Americans who think they're living in a free country, they should come to Europe, because you really see, you know, Germany is a free country, or at least a little bit freer than America.
[02:45:11.345 --> 02:45:13.966]  And, you know, Americans go around saying, we're the free ones, we're the best.
[02:45:14.426 --> 02:45:19.089]  But you gotta come to Europe, and you'll see what America could have been, or once was.
[02:45:19.769 --> 02:45:24.112]  Well, Europe's got its own brand of police state going in with thought crimes and the rest of it, but
[02:45:24.969 --> 02:45:27.291]  You know, again, they held Kerry up as the savior.
[02:45:27.331 --> 02:45:29.172]  It's all part of the fake left-right paradigm.
[02:45:29.452 --> 02:45:30.313]  Bush, bad cop.
[02:45:30.393 --> 02:45:31.194]  Europe, good cop.
[02:45:31.994 --> 02:45:36.518]  But definitely, Europeans are seeing through a lot of it because they're across the pond.
[02:45:36.538 --> 02:45:38.019]  They're outside the bubble.
[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:39.740]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:45:39.780 --> 02:45:42.922]  But you know, when I drive down the street and there's a cop behind me, I don't get nervous.
[02:45:42.962 --> 02:45:44.063]  I know he's not going to bother me.
[02:45:44.083 --> 02:45:44.904]  He's not going to pull me over.
[02:45:44.924 --> 02:45:48.807]  Whenever I visit my mom in America and there's a cop behind me, I really get nervous.
[02:45:48.847 --> 02:45:51.649]  And I know if he pulls me over, he's going to harass me.
[02:45:52.150 --> 02:45:55.531]  You know, it's just really a pain, and I just don't feel secure anymore in America.
[02:45:55.831 --> 02:45:59.812]  But here, I feel like I can walk down the street, no one's going to bother me, we hardly have any crime.
[02:46:00.232 --> 02:46:02.833]  You know, it just reminds me of the way America was when I was a kid.
[02:46:03.113 --> 02:46:06.934]  And I really feel comfortable here, and I know a lot of Americans are immigrating to Europe.
[02:46:06.954 --> 02:46:08.355]  There are more and more every day.
[02:46:08.755 --> 02:46:10.075]  And I think a lot of people are fed up.
[02:46:10.095 --> 02:46:14.337]  You know, a lot of people want to stay in America and fight, but some of us with families, we can't fight anymore.
[02:46:14.377 --> 02:46:15.897]  We just want to do what's best for our families.
[02:46:16.517 --> 02:46:18.998]  But the problem is, it's a new world order.
[02:46:19.438 --> 02:46:20.298]  Yeah.
[02:46:20.318 --> 02:46:21.599]  Don't be fooled by the fact that
[02:46:22.452 --> 02:46:26.334]  Europe is a much more pleasant place and there's less, quote, violent crime.
[02:46:27.074 --> 02:46:36.778]  The New World Order, and I was told about the places where the same chips in America are being made in Zurich, Switzerland, and the encapsulating companies, and the same plan is happening.
[02:46:36.838 --> 02:46:38.198]  It's just a little different version.
[02:46:39.019 --> 02:46:44.521]  It's a little more pleasant one, just like there's a pleasant one for Canadians and a pleasant one for New Zealanders and Australians.
[02:46:45.481 --> 02:46:46.362]  It's just a different plan.
[02:46:46.382 --> 02:46:52.084]  The reason why it's coming more violently is because Americans have a backbone and will stand up and not
[02:46:52.611 --> 02:46:53.431]  I understand that.
[02:46:53.471 --> 02:46:55.132]  I just feel a bit safer.
[02:46:55.152 --> 02:46:56.313]  But thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:46:56.353 --> 02:46:56.593]  You rule.
[02:47:11.343 --> 02:47:12.263]  Appreciate the call.
[02:47:12.364 --> 02:47:14.885]  Wow, Doctor, you really encapsulated that right there.
[02:47:14.905 --> 02:47:17.686]  I mean, they have the same agenda, just a little bit slicker.
[02:47:18.206 --> 02:47:22.909]  But here, it's just overt to dumb down the dumb and to terrify those of us who are in the know.
[02:47:22.949 --> 02:47:25.350]  I mean, hello, I'm Alberto Gonzales.
[02:47:25.530 --> 02:47:28.392]  I believe that the President is above the law and that torture is good.
[02:47:28.452 --> 02:47:30.092]  Pentagon, carry out torture.
[02:47:30.373 --> 02:47:35.635]  I believe we should arrest citizens for any misdemeanor and secretly deport them to third-party countries for slave labor.
[02:47:36.295 --> 02:47:37.856]  I am Alberto Gonzales.
[02:47:37.936 --> 02:47:39.137]  I believe in abortion.
[02:47:39.477 --> 02:47:42.359]  I believe in the most liberal forms of abortion.
[02:47:42.779 --> 02:47:47.201]  I believe in non-informing parents when their child has an abortion down to age 12.
[02:47:47.742 --> 02:47:48.862]  I am Alberto Gonzales.
[02:47:48.902 --> 02:47:49.462]  Worship me.
[02:47:49.643 --> 02:47:50.483]  I am a conservative.
[02:47:50.783 --> 02:47:51.504]  I mean, what?
[02:47:51.864 --> 02:47:53.665]  How overt is that, doctor?
[02:47:53.685 --> 02:47:58.687]  I think that we're in the grips of a satanic hold on our government.
[02:47:59.948 --> 02:48:03.250]  I think that we are right now being told that black is white and white is black.
[02:48:03.270 --> 02:48:08.913]  And I think that Christian conservatives and the senior people in the church need to be held accountable.
[02:48:09.352 --> 02:48:12.354]  That they need to start waking up and calling a spade a spade.
[02:48:12.574 --> 02:48:13.855]  There wasn't an alternative here.
[02:48:13.895 --> 02:48:14.875]  We had two bonesmen.
[02:48:15.376 --> 02:48:23.941]  Both people that have sworn blood oaths to each other and to Satan before they have sworn oaths to the nation of America and to our flag.
[02:48:24.460 --> 02:48:25.541]  and to our Constitution.
[02:48:25.962 --> 02:48:27.343]  That's what we're facing right now.
[02:48:27.663 --> 02:48:28.364]  And they admit it!
[02:48:28.404 --> 02:48:31.347]  They play the ritual on TV and go, oh, they're just having fun.
[02:48:31.887 --> 02:48:33.188]  Doctor, an incredible interview.
[02:48:33.208 --> 02:48:34.630]  I want to have you back up soon.
[02:48:35.430 --> 02:48:37.352]  We'll have your articles at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:48:37.372 --> 02:48:39.354]  We already have some of them there at InfoWars.com.
[02:48:40.515 --> 02:48:43.418]  Doctor, God bless you and I want to thank... Well, God bless you and your family.
[02:48:43.798 --> 02:48:45.320]  I talked to Violet... Hold on a second.
[02:48:46.112 --> 02:48:47.632]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.813 --> 02:48:50.893]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:51.034 --> 02:48:54.935]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.975 --> 02:48:59.196]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:59.556 --> 02:49:03.337]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.477 --> 02:49:05.278]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.858 --> 02:49:08.759]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[02:49:08.819 --> 02:49:13.520]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.680 --> 02:49:16.741]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.901 --> 02:49:19.762]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.262 --> 02:49:26.384]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.924 --> 02:49:30.707]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:51:54.241 --> 02:51:55.742]  Back from 9 to Midnight Central.

[02:52:10.190 --> 02:52:13.832]  And we've been talking for the last roughly two hours
[02:52:15.004 --> 02:52:21.429]  with an amazing individual and I hope that you will visit his website.
[02:52:22.470 --> 02:52:25.252]  Again, Dr. Bill Deagle, MD.
[02:52:26.073 --> 02:52:27.874]  Dr. Deagle, finish up what you were saying.
[02:52:28.555 --> 02:52:42.226]  Yeah, I was saying that just before we broke that I was praying for protection for you and for your ministry because we can only do things in God's will and as it was said by one of the founding fathers
[02:52:43.531 --> 02:52:45.853]  The price of liberty is eternal vigilance.
[02:52:45.933 --> 02:52:52.339]  Well, I also have to add to that, the price of truly living is being able to die for the truth.
[02:52:53.320 --> 02:53:09.734]  And I really say a prayer every day for you and your family and everyone involved, and everybody willing to speak up, not only in America, but overseas, like the gentleman that called us American from Germany, that if we do not speak up now, and again, I believe what it says in the Bible, I take it seriously, it says, you know, they overcome
[02:53:10.675 --> 02:53:20.639]  Satan and his minions, all these people like George W. and Kerry and everyone else, by the word of their testimony, by the blood of the Lamb, and they loved not their life unto death.
[02:53:20.659 --> 02:53:27.102]  And you know, if we aren't willing to stand up, we won't have children that will be able to stand up like us.
[02:53:27.282 --> 02:53:29.442]  We won't be able to speak publicly about the truth.
[02:53:30.103 --> 02:53:31.903]  And we won't be able to have a nation under God.
[02:53:31.963 --> 02:53:35.725]  It'll be a nation under Satan and it'll be a hell on earth.
[02:53:36.798 --> 02:53:39.139]  Doctor, thank you for joining us, and God bless you, my friend.
[02:53:39.159 --> 02:53:39.599]  Take care.
[02:53:39.859 --> 02:53:50.641]  Well, I really appreciate it, and I appreciate everything you're doing, because I consider you right now the bravest man in America to speak out about these things, because this is a very perilous time in our history.
[02:53:50.781 --> 02:53:52.902]  Well, it's more perilous not to fight it.
[02:53:54.142 --> 02:53:55.882]  Fire out your website one more time for folks.
[02:53:56.342 --> 02:53:57.883]  That's NutriMedical, N-U-T-R-I.

[02:54:03.284 --> 02:54:04.584]  Take care and God bless.
[02:54:04.945 --> 02:54:05.745]  Alright, my friend.
[02:54:06.325 --> 02:54:08.406]  Just briefly here, CNN poll.
[02:54:08.867 --> 02:54:09.907]  Do you believe there is a U.S.
[02:54:09.947 --> 02:54:13.429]  government cover-up surrounding 9-11?
[02:54:13.449 --> 02:54:15.250]  89%, 4,417 votes.
[02:54:15.970 --> 02:54:18.971]  No, 11%, 570 votes after their demonization piece.
[02:54:19.412 --> 02:54:24.014]  They used regular Marine Corps tanks against protesters two nights ago in L.A.
[02:54:24.054 --> 02:54:25.735]  The video of that's on Infowars.net.
[02:54:27.072 --> 02:54:29.775]  Mr. Gonzalez, we have his own memo, his own quotes.
[02:54:30.256 --> 02:54:33.679]  He is for torture, arresting American citizens for any reason.
[02:54:34.961 --> 02:54:36.002]  He is the architect.
[02:54:36.162 --> 02:54:36.923]  He is a demon.
[02:54:38.705 --> 02:54:41.447]  We have all the articles where they say he is above the law.
[02:54:41.548 --> 02:54:43.790]  The Fallujah battles are very serious for everybody.
[02:54:43.850 --> 02:54:48.335]  The civilians, our troops, several Marine Corps helicopters shot down.
[02:54:50.587 --> 02:55:10.771]  Also, folks, it is just so imperative that all of you spread the word about Building 7 because there is a major propaganda offensive taking place right now about Building 7 by the mainstream media, so please go to PrisonPlanet.com and spread our detailed analysis page around to everybody.
[02:55:11.291 --> 02:55:17.672]  They're testing Homeland Security takeover martial law drills in San Francisco with the loudspeakers, San Francisco Examiner,
[02:55:19.515 --> 02:55:20.736]  It just goes on and on.
[02:55:20.776 --> 02:55:22.417]  The dollar plunged even more.
[02:55:22.497 --> 02:55:25.198]  Now they say officially Yasser Arafat is finally dead.
[02:55:25.238 --> 02:55:28.099]  Thought I'd throw that in there for you.
[02:55:29.220 --> 02:55:32.621]  There is just so much here, but I just beg everybody to get involved now.
[02:55:33.081 --> 02:55:35.883]  MSNBC headline, a chip in your shoulder?
[02:55:36.363 --> 02:55:39.204]  Should I get the RFID implant telling you how great it is?
[02:55:40.805 --> 02:55:44.647]  Again, I'm looking for the article here about the dollar just absolutely incinerating.
[02:55:44.767 --> 02:55:45.107]  Update.
[02:55:45.958 --> 02:55:46.178]  U.S.
[02:55:46.198 --> 02:55:49.144]  dollar drops to a new all-time low again today.
[02:55:49.905 --> 02:55:52.049]  The average American has no idea what that even means.
[02:55:52.570 --> 02:55:53.492]  They know all about baseball.
[02:55:54.651 --> 02:56:10.856]  If you want any of my videos, to get them and make copies and spread the word and join us in the historical fight, InfoWars.com to order via the Safe Secure Online Shopping Cart, watch any of the films, all 11, both the books, everything, the weekly TV reports, presentplanet.tv, 15 cents a day, or toll free number to order any of the films.
[02:56:11.377 --> 02:56:13.317]  Take action now folks, join us in history.
[02:56:13.337 --> 02:56:13.397]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:56:20.091 --> 02:56:24.419]  When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord lifts up the standard against it.
[02:56:24.499 --> 02:56:25.381]  Be that standard.
[02:56:25.401 --> 02:56:26.503]  888-253-3139.
[02:56:26.803 --> 02:56:31.752]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, back tomorrow.
[02:56:31.792 --> 02:56:32.734]  God bless you all!
