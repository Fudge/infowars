[00:01:01.884 --> 00:01:05.846]  In 2002, elections were held in Iraq.
[00:01:05.846 --> 00:01:08.347]  And guess who got 100% of the votes?
[00:01:08.347 --> 00:01:09.648]  Saddam Hussein.
[00:01:09.648 --> 00:01:10.208]  Of course.
[00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:12.389]  No big surprise there.
[00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:14.710]  But nothing like that could ever happen in our country, right?
[00:01:15.858 --> 00:01:25.042]  I think the American people are owed impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives.
[00:01:25.042 --> 00:01:28.123]  Those who criticize the Patriot Act must listen.
[00:01:28.123 --> 00:01:35.586]  Year after year within this happy grove, our fellowship ends equal estate.
[00:01:35.586 --> 00:01:41.649]  A world where you only have choice on the surface, but in reality, you're a complete and total slave.
[00:01:42.424 --> 00:01:44.846]  On a global plantation.
[00:01:44.846 --> 00:01:49.169]  People need to understand this administration lied to the nation about 9-11.
[00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:52.972]  Terrorism must be looked at from all points of the globe.
[00:01:52.972 --> 00:01:56.295]  Not just America.
[00:01:56.295 --> 00:02:01.719]  I tried to warn the American people of the dangers that I saw emanating from this administration.
[00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:07.084]  The war on terrorism is a thin cover for the war on dissent.
[00:02:07.084 --> 00:02:09.806]  They'll swear up and down a bill that's going to give you more freedom.
[00:02:10.416 --> 00:02:13.138]  And it's actually, uh, giving you a lot less.
[00:02:13.138 --> 00:02:20.041]  So to all the tyrants today, and all the tyrants back in history, and the tyrants to come in the future, you will be defeated!
[00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:26.825]  You have the spirits of evil working in the leaders, and in the politicians, and in the generals, working with them.
[00:02:26.825 --> 00:02:28.266]  You have nothing but evil.
[00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:32.468]  You need to answer real questions instead of lying.
[00:02:32.468 --> 00:02:35.990]  You are both in skull and bones of secret society.
[00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.451]  It's so sick we can't talk about it.
[00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:38.532]  What does that mean for America?
[00:02:39.935 --> 00:02:46.097]  The conspiracy theorists are going to go wild.
[00:02:46.097 --> 00:02:49.799]  You both were members of Skull and Bones, a secret society in Yale.
[00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.239]  What does that tell us?
[00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.720]  Uh, not much because it's a secret.
[00:02:54.318 --> 00:02:55.359]  Is there a secret handshake?
[00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:56.880]  Is there a secret code?
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.221]  I wish there were something secret I could manifest.
[00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:00.242]  322?
[00:03:00.242 --> 00:03:01.302]  A secret number?
[00:03:01.302 --> 00:03:02.603]  There are all kinds of secrets.
[00:03:02.603 --> 00:03:03.884]  If this were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier.
[00:03:03.884 --> 00:03:04.684]  Just as long as I'm the dictator.
[00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:05.204]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:05.204 --> 00:03:05.545]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:05.545 --> 00:03:05.965]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:05.965 --> 00:03:06.405]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:06.405 --> 00:03:06.825]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:06.825 --> 00:03:07.306]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:07.306 --> 00:03:07.686]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:07.686 --> 00:03:08.066]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:08.486]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:08.486 --> 00:03:08.967]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:08.967 --> 00:03:09.367]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:09.367 --> 00:03:09.867]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:09.867 --> 00:03:10.327]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:10.327 --> 00:03:10.728]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:10.728 --> 00:03:11.168]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:11.168 --> 00:03:11.648]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:11.648 --> 00:03:12.248]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:12.248 --> 00:03:12.749]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:13.089]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.529]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:13.869]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:14.250]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.690]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:15.030]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.390]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.830]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:16.191]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:16.191 --> 00:03:17.612]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:17.612 --> 00:03:18.692]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:18.692 --> 00:03:20.413]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:20.413 --> 00:03:20.973]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:20.973 --> 00:03:21.774]  I'm the dictator.
[00:03:21.774 --> 00:03:21.834]  I'm
[00:03:22.406 --> 00:03:29.608]  Well, it's the system of power, the system of control, our real form of government in this country.
[00:03:29.608 --> 00:03:36.611]  The American dictatorship is the powerful global corporations that own and control the military-industrial complex.
[00:03:37.506 --> 00:03:44.352]  Giving you false choices so you think that you have a decision to make in the 2004 election.
[00:03:44.352 --> 00:03:56.462]  But either way, a Blue Blood from the East Coast wins.
[00:03:56.462 --> 00:04:00.946]  Those guys were both members of the Secret Society at Yale, right?
[00:04:00.946 --> 00:04:03.608]  I have on my website, infowarriors.com.
[00:04:03.608 --> 00:04:05.309]  So this new guy is no better than the old guy?
[00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.750]  Here's the deal.
[00:04:06.656 --> 00:04:08.597]  If you believe Reuters, they're third cousins.
[00:04:08.597 --> 00:04:10.537]  If you believe the Associated Press, they're ninth cousins.
[00:04:10.537 --> 00:04:12.898]  They're both ninth cousins to Hugh Hefner.
[00:04:12.898 --> 00:04:21.360]  They're members of the same secret society, only 15 members each year, which admittedly was set up in 1832 to overthrow the U.S.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:33.964]  We only have 800 living members of that organization, but you can count their members as three presidents, eight CIA directors, many of the heads of the Fortune 500, and they work in concert together.
[00:04:34.713 --> 00:04:42.502]  To bring you the unfolding police state, to bring you these criminal wars of aggression against sovereign, innocent nations.
[00:04:42.502 --> 00:04:44.404]  Bush, Kerry and Heffner, odd cousins.
[00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.880]  Oh, you found it?
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.664]  Well, understand, anything I spew out is documented up one side and down the other.
[00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:50.986]  I don't care how crazy it sounds.
[00:04:50.986 --> 00:04:51.546]  You're right, though.
[00:04:51.546 --> 00:04:52.427]  Check this out.
[00:04:52.427 --> 00:04:58.274]  Hugh Hefner was quoted as saying, I would be delighted to invite President Bush and Senator Kerry for a family reunion.
[00:04:58.274 --> 00:05:02.339]  CBS News confirms that Bush, Kerry and Hefner are cousins.
[00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:05.983]  It's very important to know that this film has been made in the course of the last 12 months.
[00:05:06.713 --> 00:05:12.978]  And time and time again on my own syndicated radio broadcast, and as we made this documentary, I said, look, it's going to be Kerry.
[00:05:12.978 --> 00:05:16.821]  Even when Dean was ahead of Kerry, I said, it's going to be Kerry.
[00:05:16.821 --> 00:05:17.942]  Think of that.
[00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:34.234]  Out of 290 million Americans, we have two people from the most elite secret society in the United States, only 15 members tapped or chosen each year, and this is who we get for our presidential candidates.
[00:05:35.013 --> 00:05:41.538]  Out of 290 million, two people from the same organization that just chooses a couple people every year.
[00:05:41.538 --> 00:05:43.560]  It's absolutely incredible.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.402]  Can you guys open website audio up on the air?
[00:05:46.402 --> 00:05:58.171]  You can go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com right now, scroll down, it says Skull & Bones, and you can play the clip of Bush on Meet the Press a few weeks ago saying, yeah, it's so secret I can't talk about it.
[00:05:58.171 --> 00:06:00.493]  Let me play this.
[00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:02.835]  You were both in Skull & Bones, the secret society.
[00:06:03.971 --> 00:06:05.452]  It's so secret we can't talk about it.
[00:06:05.452 --> 00:06:07.952]  What does that mean for America?
[00:06:07.952 --> 00:06:09.493]  The conspiracy theorists are going to go wild.
[00:06:09.493 --> 00:06:10.533]  I'm sure they are.
[00:06:10.533 --> 00:06:11.294]  I don't know.
[00:06:11.294 --> 00:06:12.514]  I haven't seen the web.
[00:06:12.514 --> 00:06:15.955]  Number 322?
[00:06:15.955 --> 00:06:17.956]  First of all, he's not the nominee.
[00:06:17.956 --> 00:06:20.257]  Are you prepared to lose?
[00:06:20.257 --> 00:06:21.097]  No, I'm not going to lose.
[00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:26.023]  He kind of skipped over it, didn't he?
[00:06:26.023 --> 00:06:27.665]  Well, he just said it's so secret I can't talk about it.
[00:06:27.665 --> 00:06:28.806]  Now, go down under that.
[00:06:28.806 --> 00:06:29.967]  Oh, so he was serious?
[00:06:29.967 --> 00:06:31.409]  I thought he was kidding!
[00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:32.610]  Under that is Lord Kerry.
[00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.592]  I'll meet the press about a month earlier.
[00:06:34.592 --> 00:06:38.277]  You both were members of Skull and Bones, a secret society in Yale.
[00:06:38.277 --> 00:06:39.758]  What does that tell us?
[00:06:39.758 --> 00:06:41.220]  Uh, not much because it's a secret.
[00:06:42.799 --> 00:06:43.859]  Is there a secret handshake?
[00:06:43.859 --> 00:06:45.360]  Is there a secret code?
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.741]  I wish there were something secret I could manifest.
[00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:48.761]  322?
[00:06:48.761 --> 00:06:49.941]  A secret number?
[00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:52.742]  There are all kinds of secrets, Tim, but one thing is not a secret.
[00:06:52.742 --> 00:06:56.423]  I disagree with this president's direction that he's taking the country.
[00:06:56.423 --> 00:07:00.864]  We can do a better job, and I intend to do it.
[00:07:00.864 --> 00:07:01.804]  Wow!
[00:07:01.804 --> 00:07:04.445]  Do you know what's interesting about that clip?
[00:07:04.445 --> 00:07:04.885]  They both?
[00:07:05.874 --> 00:07:12.424]  Gave the same short answer and moved on to the next subject with a little chuckle in between.
[00:07:12.424 --> 00:07:13.986]  I'm saying it's all staged.
[00:07:13.986 --> 00:07:14.928]  That's pretty weird.
[00:07:14.928 --> 00:07:16.370]  So we have these cousins.
[00:07:17.088 --> 00:07:24.373]  Who are members of the same secret society, who have sworn an oath to each other, above all other oaths.
[00:07:24.373 --> 00:07:34.060]  And they admit, even in the mainstream media, but laugh and say, oh, it's no big deal, that these so-called leaders engage in bizarre occultic rituals.
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:39.944]  And it's so weird that the general public has trouble even interfacing with it.
[00:07:39.944 --> 00:07:42.966]  There's kind of a cognitive dissonance that we don't want to believe it.
[00:07:42.966 --> 00:07:43.987]  We cannot ignore it.
[00:07:45.282 --> 00:07:48.226]  It's right out in the open.
[00:07:48.226 --> 00:07:51.451]  What about Skull & Bones?
[00:07:51.451 --> 00:08:01.626]  Skull & Bones obviously gets a good deal of attention simply because, A, it's secret,
[00:08:02.853 --> 00:08:18.653]  And B, the members are people who often turn up in high places later in life and we'll certainly hear lots about it this year because both George W. Bush and John Kerry were
[00:08:19.438 --> 00:08:21.039]  We're good to go.
[00:08:36.415 --> 00:08:48.765]  Hold the real power in the world, and because of its secrecy and because of the elite background of many of its members, Skull and Bones is a prime candidate for that.
[00:08:48.765 --> 00:08:53.029]  Well, this isn't just Skull and Bones when they're 22 or whatever.
[00:08:53.029 --> 00:08:54.990]  This is when they're old men at Bohemian Grove.
[00:08:54.990 --> 00:09:01.956]  And the point is, in the Trio Network documentary for my footage, they admit, yes, Mr. Jones got the ritual, yes, we're doing this, but it's just for fun.
[00:09:01.956 --> 00:09:04.578]  Well, the point is, is that it's a ritual about not having a conscience.
[00:09:08.219 --> 00:09:11.921]  Alex Jones has been talking about this for quite a while.
[00:09:11.921 --> 00:09:31.770]  The Bohemian Grove, of course, is a privately owned redwood grove up in Sonoma County, north of San Francisco, where every summer there is a get-together of the wealthy and well-placed, all male, who
[00:09:33.326 --> 00:09:46.359]  Get together for general cavorting, socializing, lectures, symposia, and so on, in an atmosphere that is completely removed from public scrutiny.
[00:09:46.359 --> 00:09:55.528]  Alex Jones and some others have suggested for a long time that there are all sorts of nefarious rituals that go on.
[00:10:06.617 --> 00:10:14.418]  I woke up one morning to learn that I had been attacked for an hour and a half on C-SPAN by Brian Lamb and some professor.
[00:10:14.418 --> 00:10:24.420]  And the professor gets up there and says, well Mr. Jones claims he snuck into this place called Bohemian Grove and Mr. Jones claims all these wild things.
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.841]  Look, I have the video.
[00:10:25.841 --> 00:10:27.701]  They admit I snuck in.
[00:10:27.701 --> 00:10:30.282]  It's been in the major newspapers on the West Coast.
[00:10:30.282 --> 00:10:31.302]  The San Francisco Chronicle,
[00:10:32.378 --> 00:10:35.340]  The newspaper there in Santa Rosa, The Press Democrat.
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:39.923]  And I snuck in, and here were our so-called Christian conservative leaders worshiping Mueller.
[00:10:39.923 --> 00:10:46.848]  Year after year, within this happy grove, our fellowship fans thee for a space.
[00:10:46.848 --> 00:10:54.953]  Time of eminence, which would facilitate it, has lost its power under these friendly trees.
[00:10:54.953 --> 00:10:57.795]  So shall we be once again this night,
[00:10:59.481 --> 00:11:10.288]  From the Skull and Bones Society at Yale, founded in 1832, to the Bohemian Grove, founded in 1872, that path has led us back to Monteria and the Bohemian Grove in Northern California.
[00:11:22.205 --> 00:11:24.866]  Here we are, my friends, three years later.
[00:11:24.866 --> 00:11:31.210]  There have been a lot of news articles and rumors about world leaders meeting and engaging in satanic rituals.
[00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:40.335]  Now, the news admitted that the world leaders met here every year, going back at least 75 years, with presidents coming here going back over 100 years ago.
[00:11:40.335 --> 00:11:44.517]  But, we wanted to try to put the rumors to rest, find out if it was true.
[00:11:44.517 --> 00:11:48.639]  We snuck in to the Bohemian Grove, and I was able to catch
[00:11:49.557 --> 00:11:52.538]  One of their many rituals on tape, the cremation of Pierre.
[00:11:52.538 --> 00:11:59.460]  And yes, the leaders of the Bohemian Grove, based in San Francisco, have admitted that I did indeed sneak in and videotape the ritual.
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.381]  But they say I'm blowing it all out of proportion.
[00:12:01.381 --> 00:12:02.261]  They're just having fun.
[00:12:02.261 --> 00:12:03.962]  It's a theatrical production.
[00:12:03.962 --> 00:12:09.744]  Yes, our Christian conservative leaders meeting and engaging in an ancient Canaanite human sacrifice reenactment ritual.
[00:12:09.744 --> 00:12:15.106]  It's no big deal here in the Transylvanian-style woods of Northern California.
[00:12:15.106 --> 00:12:18.247]  The published annals of the Grove
[00:12:18.852 --> 00:12:23.335]  Admit that the Manhattan Project, developing the atom bomb, was developed here.
[00:12:23.335 --> 00:12:29.038]  The Star Wars Project, in the late 1970s, was hatched at one of the Grove encampments.
[00:12:29.038 --> 00:12:38.344]  And I was stunned, in late 2004, to see two articles in the New York Times, talking about the Bohemian Grove.
[00:12:38.344 --> 00:12:43.627]  Another article in the Wall Street Journal, exposing Bohemian Grove, but saying that it was no big deal.
[00:12:43.627 --> 00:12:45.808]  We pulled down the river.
[00:12:45.808 --> 00:12:46.689]  Our trunk got stuck.
[00:12:47.751 --> 00:12:50.952]  We get out, we go down, talk to the fire department.
[00:12:50.952 --> 00:12:52.373]  They come down to pull us out.
[00:12:52.373 --> 00:12:53.853]  We just say, hey, what's the Bohemian Grove?
[00:12:53.853 --> 00:12:56.914]  They begin threatening us to all turn the cameras off.
[00:12:56.914 --> 00:12:58.134]  Thanks a lot, buddy.
[00:12:58.134 --> 00:13:03.416]  So Brian, do you work at the Bohemian Grove?
[00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:05.717]  Well, we're not here for that.
[00:13:05.717 --> 00:13:07.838]  No, I was asking him about it because I've heard about it.
[00:13:07.838 --> 00:13:11.259]  And then he says he works there.
[00:13:11.259 --> 00:13:12.079]  He's lying.
[00:13:12.079 --> 00:13:13.600]  He doesn't work there, sir.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.800]  Well, he was telling me about
[00:13:28.915 --> 00:13:37.582]  Here we are at the entrance to the 2,700 acre club that really begins a few hundred yards back there with several guard shacks and checkpoints.
[00:13:37.582 --> 00:13:38.203]  How's it going bud?
[00:13:38.203 --> 00:13:42.166]  It says Bohemian Grove Security.
[00:13:42.166 --> 00:13:43.347]  We were driving through this town
[00:13:44.079 --> 00:13:45.060]  And we asked, what was in the town?
[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.102]  They said, the Pink Elephant, a motel, and the Bohemian Club.
[00:13:47.102 --> 00:13:47.722]  We said, what's the club?
[00:13:47.722 --> 00:13:49.744]  They said, that's where these rich people go.
[00:13:49.744 --> 00:13:51.425]  Like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:13:51.425 --> 00:13:56.249]  Then, we asked a firefighter about it, because our truck was stuck, and he freaked out and said, I'm not talking about it.
[00:13:56.249 --> 00:13:57.390]  Now we're interested.
[00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:01.393]  So, uh, what goes on here?
[00:14:01.393 --> 00:14:03.475]  A resort for rich people.
[00:14:03.475 --> 00:14:04.556]  Okay.
[00:14:04.556 --> 00:14:05.737]  Thanks.
[00:14:05.737 --> 00:14:07.258]  See you later.
[00:14:07.258 --> 00:14:09.420]  Here, let's stop and ask this person.
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.661]  About the Grove.
[00:14:10.661 --> 00:14:11.942]  You guys know about the Bohemian Grove?
[00:14:13.666 --> 00:14:14.346]  What do you think of it?
[00:14:14.346 --> 00:14:17.989]  I've been here 49 years.
[00:14:17.989 --> 00:14:19.030]  Been here 49 years?
[00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:20.231]  I've been here 49 years.
[00:14:20.231 --> 00:14:22.672]  What do you think of the Grove?
[00:14:22.672 --> 00:14:23.833]  Still there?
[00:14:23.833 --> 00:14:25.514]  I never worked up there or anything.
[00:14:25.514 --> 00:14:26.355]  Oh, yes you have.
[00:14:26.355 --> 00:14:28.816]  I disagree.
[00:14:28.816 --> 00:14:32.279]  Oh, he means we don't have the ID.
[00:14:32.279 --> 00:14:39.784]  Hi, I'm not... And neither is... Is that an electric eye?
[00:14:39.784 --> 00:14:41.025]  Yes.
[00:14:41.025 --> 00:14:41.265]  Cool.
[00:14:41.869 --> 00:14:43.749]  We're over here looking for a handbag.
[00:14:43.749 --> 00:14:46.430]  What do you think of the Bohemian Grove?
[00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:48.590]  Um... They throw a lot of parties out there.
[00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:53.351]  A lot of government officials come in and fly in and fly out.
[00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:56.112]  I'd like to get one of their IDs.
[00:14:56.112 --> 00:14:58.752]  Oh, we've had that one.
[00:14:58.752 --> 00:15:00.972]  What do you think?
[00:15:00.972 --> 00:15:02.013]  What do we think of it?
[00:15:02.013 --> 00:15:03.653]  What is the Bohemian Grove?
[00:15:03.653 --> 00:15:07.034]  Bohemian Grove's a man's, uh... Oh, now they're men!
[00:15:07.034 --> 00:15:07.854]  Party place, right?
[00:15:07.854 --> 00:15:09.274]  You are so full of...
[00:15:10.015 --> 00:15:11.415]  Oh, you said that because you're a man.
[00:15:11.415 --> 00:15:14.136]  That's how you found out.
[00:15:14.136 --> 00:15:19.658]  Well, not being a man, I found out slightly differently.
[00:15:19.658 --> 00:15:22.399]  You found out about the Grove differently?
[00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:26.960]  Yeah, because I didn't go there as a man to party.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:34.062]  I went there as a woman to party, because... Well... Come on, Carol.
[00:15:34.062 --> 00:15:36.603]  Look, that's a valet, okay?
[00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:37.243]  Have a good evening.
[00:15:38.625 --> 00:15:39.425]  Where?
[00:15:39.425 --> 00:15:40.686]  What channel is this on?
[00:15:40.686 --> 00:15:41.887]  Should we follow you?
[00:15:41.887 --> 00:15:44.189]  We'll follow you!
[00:15:44.189 --> 00:15:46.551]  Alright.
[00:15:46.551 --> 00:15:48.432]  Bye!
[00:15:48.432 --> 00:15:50.434]  You're beginning to sink deeper into the rabbit hole now.
[00:15:50.434 --> 00:15:54.958]  And find out about the Grove.
[00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:58.961]  This is a Twilight Zone, like, Lovecraft novel or something.
[00:16:00.399 --> 00:16:12.589]  I want to tell everybody out in TV land how they can come to the Grove, where their elected leaders, along with the big bankers and the heads of media, meet, along with some European royalty, every year to decide how to run the country.
[00:16:12.589 --> 00:16:15.411]  You can fly into San Francisco, or you can fly into Santa Rosa.
[00:16:15.411 --> 00:16:19.575]  You can even fly into Sacramento, and, well, you just drive out to Highway 101, you take
[00:16:20.668 --> 00:16:23.149]  Highway 12 out west towards the coast.
[00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:27.451]  You can get about 10 miles out from the coast, right out to the little town of Monterio.
[00:16:27.451 --> 00:16:32.352]  In the town of Monterio, off the main drag, you'll take the Bohemian Avenue.
[00:16:32.352 --> 00:16:47.038]  And it dead ends right here at the 2,700 acre Redwood Grove entrance, where your world leaders, among other things, set policy for much of the planet and the rest of them in black and red robes and worship, well, Moloch.
[00:16:47.038 --> 00:16:47.858]  They would say that Moloch
[00:16:48.707 --> 00:16:57.129]  It's so generational.
[00:16:57.129 --> 00:17:00.930]  They're so compartmentalized at the top of the pyramid that they don't even know it.
[00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.551]  This is what they are.
[00:17:03.551 --> 00:17:07.372]  They're a beast just rending people.
[00:17:07.372 --> 00:17:16.614]  The modern dictatorship relies on what is euphemistically called mind control.
[00:17:16.614 --> 00:17:17.314]  Many Americans
[00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:29.421]  Some people have wacky ideas, like taxing gasoline more, so people drive less.
[00:17:29.421 --> 00:17:32.303]  That's John Kerry.
[00:17:32.303 --> 00:17:34.543]  Who's crooked in line?
[00:17:34.543 --> 00:17:35.244]  The President?
[00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:52.374]  Uh, I was talking about the attack machine.
[00:17:52.374 --> 00:17:56.278]  So this, in essence, is the American dictatorship.
[00:17:56.278 --> 00:18:05.225]  A world where you only have choice on the surface, but in reality, you're a complete and total slave on a global plantation.
[00:18:05.225 --> 00:18:06.906]  A feudal sir.
[00:18:06.906 --> 00:18:12.111]  I think the American people are owed impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives.
[00:18:18.647 --> 00:18:23.028]  After all, the Congress ought to obey one provision of the U.S.
[00:18:23.028 --> 00:18:27.129]  Constitution that they are sworn to uphold.
[00:18:27.129 --> 00:18:46.974]  In March of 2004, on the one-year anniversary of the beginning of Gulf War II, a local peace group based in Dallas, Texas, requested that I come and speak after Ralph Nader, the popular consumer advocate who also ran for president in 2000.
[00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.811]  And I told him, look, I don't really support Ralph Nader.
[00:18:50.811 --> 00:18:54.372]  I think he'd obviously be better than George Bush or Al Gore.
[00:18:54.372 --> 00:19:00.435]  He could be a shill put in there to ensure that Lord Bush gets into office yet again.
[00:19:00.435 --> 00:19:10.498]  But I said that I doubt that because things are so obviously staged between the two literal kissing cousins, the two coffin mates from Skull and Bones, Kerry and Bush.
[00:19:10.498 --> 00:19:17.561]  But I said I'll be glad to go and give a speech about the New World Order and hopefully wake up people on the supposed left.
[00:19:17.861 --> 00:19:20.923]  Because when you really get down to it, the left and right are controlled by the same people.
[00:19:20.923 --> 00:19:26.387]  I don't see that as really an accurate reality when you truly investigate the facts.
[00:19:26.387 --> 00:19:30.009]  Members of both parties were in complicity.
[00:19:30.009 --> 00:19:43.859]  They surrendered their sacred constitutional authority and gave the authority to declare war under his timing and place and manner unconstitutionally to George W. Bush.
[00:19:46.056 --> 00:19:47.756]  Nobody was indicted.
[00:19:47.756 --> 00:19:49.417]  Nobody was prosecuted.
[00:19:49.417 --> 00:20:02.160]  You go out here in Texas and violate a traffic ordinance and you'll get a more severe penalty than the egregious violation of your own constitutional rights by the Congress of the President of the United States.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.380]  There were about 800 people there.
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.281]  There was one peace group that had
[00:20:08.143 --> 00:20:22.787]  Gotten time there at the City Park in Crawford, Texas, right outside George Bush's Hollywood set, where he struts around acting like a cowboy and not a British royal blueblood from Kennebunkport, Maine.
[00:20:22.787 --> 00:20:33.549]  And we got there, and the people that had brought in Ralph Nader, the state coordinators, they wanted me to speak, and they had actually got the time for Ralph Nader at 5 p.m.
[00:20:33.549 --> 00:20:36.150]  But when it got time for me to go up and introduce Ralph Nader,
[00:20:37.725 --> 00:20:43.171]  The so-called peace group from Austin, Texas was outraged.
[00:20:43.171 --> 00:20:46.575]  The UT professor was outraged.
[00:20:46.575 --> 00:20:49.938]  They began trying to keep me from speaking.
[00:20:49.938 --> 00:20:52.081]  I nicely went ahead and gave them the microphone back.
[00:20:52.622 --> 00:21:01.876]  And then we had to have some local authorities explain to them that indeed, Ralph Nader's group had invited me in to speak, and that indeed, I was supposed to then go and introduce him.
[00:21:01.876 --> 00:21:07.444]  The military industrial complex runs the red light cameras, the cameras in the schools, the private prisons.
[00:21:07.444 --> 00:21:08.526]  That's what it's all about!
[00:21:09.046 --> 00:21:13.409]  They are setting up a Nazi Germany-type system here domestically.
[00:21:13.409 --> 00:21:13.970]  And you know what?
[00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:16.271]  I want to thank the folks that put this together.
[00:21:16.271 --> 00:21:17.732]  Lori Tyson and others.
[00:21:17.732 --> 00:21:19.914]  They're the ones that brought Ralph Mayer in.
[00:21:19.914 --> 00:21:21.735]  And the local folks are great, too.
[00:21:21.735 --> 00:21:22.496]  But it's 5 o'clock.
[00:21:22.496 --> 00:21:23.596]  They're not supposed to be up here.
[00:21:23.596 --> 00:21:27.359]  But here they are because, well, they love talking to crowds.
[00:21:27.359 --> 00:21:28.000]  God bless you.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.181]  I'm coming up later to expose the New World Order.
[00:21:30.181 --> 00:21:32.383]  Stay with us.
[00:21:32.383 --> 00:21:33.223]  Yeah!
[00:21:33.223 --> 00:21:34.965]  Just amazing activity.
[00:21:34.965 --> 00:21:38.347]  The fissures we see even in the so-called peace movement.
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:48.844]  And their abject fear of me because I'm pro-gun, pro-national sovereignty, and against the tyranny of the Democratic Party.
[00:21:48.844 --> 00:21:53.766]  Bill Clinton did a lot to destroy our liberties and freedoms because he's a tool of the elite.
[00:21:53.766 --> 00:22:00.129]  Bill Clinton helped protect bin Laden when Sudan and Afghanistan wanted to arrest him.
[00:22:00.129 --> 00:22:05.451]  He was just carrying out the policy of the CIA as an active puppet for the globalists.
[00:22:06.269 --> 00:22:08.030]  But they couldn't seem to figure that out.
[00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:20.114]  They can't understand that, that if we're going to get our country back, so-called right-wingers and so-called left-wingers and libertarians are going to have to come together and really get outside the box and see the big picture.
[00:22:20.114 --> 00:22:24.415]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, I want to see if I get up here they magically appear again.
[00:22:24.415 --> 00:22:30.738]  Seriously, if we're going to defeat this global tyranny, the left and right have to wake up to the fact the left and right is a fraud.
[00:22:30.738 --> 00:22:34.379]  The only difference between George W. Bush and John Forbes Kerry
[00:22:35.094 --> 00:22:37.095]  Well, they're cousins, they're members of Skull and Bones.
[00:22:37.095 --> 00:22:40.616]  Their voting record is almost identical!
[00:22:40.616 --> 00:22:41.676]  Think about that.
[00:22:41.676 --> 00:22:44.677]  Their voting record is almost identical.
[00:22:44.677 --> 00:22:47.457]  They both voted for the war.
[00:22:47.457 --> 00:22:49.098]  They're all for the same issues.
[00:22:49.098 --> 00:22:51.319]  That's the key here.
[00:22:51.319 --> 00:23:03.802]  And I have to tell you that after having a chance to talk to Ralph Nader's staff, after being able to interview Mr. Nader, I do think that there is a well-founded suspicion
[00:23:04.474 --> 00:23:14.724]  by a lot of Democrats that Ralph Nader is acting whether unconsciously or consciously as a agent to throw the election to George W. Bush.
[00:23:14.724 --> 00:23:16.546]  The Democrats say anybody but Bush
[00:23:17.256 --> 00:23:19.838]  Whereas in reality, it really doesn't matter.
[00:23:19.838 --> 00:23:22.741]  Either way, they've got this election fixed.
[00:23:22.741 --> 00:23:30.527]  As we said, this is the American dictatorship where the elite gets their man, their puppet, their figurehead in the position of power.
[00:23:30.527 --> 00:23:40.695]  We were partially responsible, our government was partially responsible for Saddam Hussein as we were supporting any so-called anti-communist dictator in the world.
[00:23:40.695 --> 00:23:44.919]  Along with the British, we helped entrench him as a dictator of Iraq in 1979.
[00:23:47.403 --> 00:23:50.084]  We equipped him with arms.
[00:23:50.084 --> 00:23:56.387]  We gave him foreign assistance and credits.
[00:23:56.387 --> 00:24:11.313]  We had our corporations apply and receive export permits from the Department of Commerce in the 1980s under the Reagan and Bush 1 administration, providing this brutal dictator with the raw materials for chemical and biological warfare.
[00:24:12.572 --> 00:24:21.815]  In 1983, Donald Rumsfeld, Special Envoy, visited Saddam Hussein when these materials were being used and didn't say anything.
[00:24:21.815 --> 00:24:24.556]  He was our dictator, after all, wasn't he?
[00:24:24.556 --> 00:24:26.597]  He was our dictator.
[00:24:26.597 --> 00:24:27.157]  The U.S.
[00:24:27.157 --> 00:24:35.060]  government has overthrown over 50 dictators since World War II without invading them.
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:41.802]  They're experts at overthrowing not our dictators, the other side's dictators.
[00:24:42.932 --> 00:24:45.252]  It's interesting just to speculate.
[00:24:45.252 --> 00:24:57.855]  Why in the world, knowing that he's a tottering dictator with disloyal troops ready to run at a moment's notice, surrounded by enemies, why in the world didn't the U.S.
[00:24:57.855 --> 00:25:03.736]  government under George W. Bush merely overthrow him instead of invade Iraq?
[00:25:03.736 --> 00:25:06.676]  There's a three-letter word for that, folks.
[00:25:06.676 --> 00:25:08.937]  Loyal!
[00:25:08.937 --> 00:25:09.237]  Loyal.
[00:25:11.457 --> 00:25:20.123]  What did we see in the last election between Albert Gore and George W. Bush in 2000?
[00:25:20.123 --> 00:25:34.453]  We saw two different rival factions inside the New World Order fighting for control, fighting for the management position of CEO of the New World Order, of Slavery Incorporated.
[00:25:34.453 --> 00:25:38.376]  It's clear that Al Gore did win the popular vote.
[00:25:38.376 --> 00:25:39.877]  It's not clear if that
[00:25:40.592 --> 00:25:51.776]  popular vote was actually his, or if Democratic operatives had stuffed ballot boxes and manipulated votes at the local level to the point of him winning by a narrow margin.
[00:25:51.776 --> 00:26:01.839]  But what is clear is that George W. Bush and different members of the constabulary in Florida and other states did steal the election, did block recounts,
[00:26:02.439 --> 00:26:07.482]  ...did disregard numbers that showed that Al Gore had indeed won the election.
[00:26:07.482 --> 00:26:20.509]  And then when that was in question, the Supreme Court, seven of the nine members appointed by Republicans, then returned the favor and appointed George Walker Bush as President of the United States.
[00:26:29.235 --> 00:26:34.718]  We're talking about a dictatorship of the mind where the people are scared into absolute submission.
[00:26:34.718 --> 00:26:43.843]  Did you ever imagine that you would see the federal government up on television saying, well, the terrorists may want to disrupt our democratic process.
[00:26:43.843 --> 00:26:46.245]  We're going to have to disrupt the democratic process.
[00:26:46.245 --> 00:26:54.069]  We may need to cancel or suspend the election if there's a threat or if there is a terrorist attack.
[00:26:54.935 --> 00:26:57.597]  But I thought the terrorists wanted to disrupt our elections.
[00:26:57.597 --> 00:27:00.779]  So why would you now try to disrupt the elections?
[00:27:00.779 --> 00:27:05.202]  How obvious, how transparent, how see-through is that?
[00:27:05.202 --> 00:27:19.071]  There was a case in Tennessee where the tabulation software added illegally a quarter of a vote to the favored candidate for every one vote that the unfavored candidate received.
[00:27:19.071 --> 00:27:20.872]  Now that was flat out wrong.
[00:27:20.872 --> 00:27:24.535]  But because this particular unfavored
[00:27:25.035 --> 00:27:27.897]  The candidate had Judge Joe Brown on his side.
[00:27:27.897 --> 00:27:31.859]  They were able to sue and find out exactly what happened.
[00:27:31.859 --> 00:27:37.342]  So we understand that these manipulations are going to take place.
[00:27:37.342 --> 00:27:39.963]  ES&S, election systems and software.
[00:27:39.963 --> 00:27:42.285]  Republican Senator Chuck Hagel.
[00:27:42.285 --> 00:27:43.025]  Who is he?
[00:27:43.025 --> 00:27:46.947]  He's got ownership ties to a holding company, to ES&S.
[00:27:46.947 --> 00:27:48.989]  Well, he's a 20-year friend of the Bush family.
[00:27:48.989 --> 00:27:51.530]  He almost became our vice president instead of Dick Cheney.
[00:27:52.359 --> 00:28:01.787]  And he won his seat in the Senate twice by these big landslides in Nebraska, in a state that had not elected a Republican Senator in over 24 years.
[00:28:01.787 --> 00:28:03.068]  But you know what?
[00:28:03.068 --> 00:28:08.513]  The votes were counted, 80% of his votes were counted by ES&S voting machines.
[00:28:08.513 --> 00:28:11.035]  Maybe it's a little coincidence, I don't know.
[00:28:11.035 --> 00:28:12.035]  Don't know.
[00:28:12.035 --> 00:28:21.063]  It's very important for everyone out there to spend time looking at the election process in your county and your city.
[00:28:21.701 --> 00:28:35.775]  While Americans are being fed a steady diet of Michael Jackson and Lacey Peterson and lots of football, our elections are being stolen by the owners and controllers of electronic voting machine companies by rigged software and no paper audit trails.
[00:28:35.775 --> 00:28:38.898]  And time is running out for us to do something about it.
[00:28:38.898 --> 00:28:44.083]  I spoke to Libertarian Distinguished Speaker Series here in Austin, Texas.
[00:28:45.009 --> 00:28:55.372]  And I have to tell you, I was delighted when I told the crowd of several hundred people that if anybody here disagrees with me, please ask a question, please state why.
[00:28:55.372 --> 00:28:57.853]  And no one said that they disagreed with me.
[00:28:57.853 --> 00:29:00.994]  This shows that we're winning the intellectual battle.
[00:29:00.994 --> 00:29:04.575]  That a mass awakening, a renaissance, is taking place.
[00:29:04.575 --> 00:29:06.996]  And that's the best news I can give you.
[00:29:06.996 --> 00:29:14.098]  You know how when a tornado's coming, or an earthquake, and they've done studies of this at major universities, mice, dogs, cats,
[00:29:15.017 --> 00:29:20.540]  Get restless, start running around, get upset, sometimes hours, sometimes even days before.
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.922]  They have that sixth sense.
[00:29:22.922 --> 00:29:24.462]  They have that instinct.
[00:29:24.462 --> 00:29:28.985]  They have that survival mechanism deep inside them.
[00:29:28.985 --> 00:29:32.907]  And we all have that too, as the most advanced creature on this planet.
[00:29:32.907 --> 00:29:35.549]  But it's pushed to the side by modern culture.
[00:29:35.549 --> 00:29:36.950]  We're supposed to ignore it.
[00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:42.633]  So the point I'm trying to make is, deep down, people know that something is wrong.
[00:29:43.271 --> 00:29:51.214]  Deep down, people are ready to move and stand up against the New World Order.
[00:29:51.214 --> 00:30:04.598]  And it was exciting to be able to hear the speaker before I spoke who detailed just some of the key smoking guns and bullet points and red flags concerning industrialized election fraud.
[00:30:04.598 --> 00:30:08.040]  In 2002, elections were held in Iraq.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.520]  And guess who got 100% of the votes?
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:11.861]  Saddam Hussein.
[00:30:11.861 --> 00:30:12.221]  Of course.
[00:30:12.708 --> 00:30:14.609]  Don't be surprised there.
[00:30:14.609 --> 00:30:18.871]  But nothing like that could ever happen in our country, right?
[00:30:18.871 --> 00:30:31.857]  Well, what if I were to tell you today that virtually any hacker with a laptop could hack into the electronic voting machines that are being used?
[00:30:31.857 --> 00:30:36.680]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones and I'm a syndicated radio and television host based in Austin, Texas.
[00:30:38.477 --> 00:30:44.460]  And I am launching a nationwide movement to expose Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:50.722]  You know, most Americans think of Arnold Schwarzenegger as a bodybuilder-turned-actor who then became the governor of California.
[00:30:50.722 --> 00:30:58.545]  A lot of us grew up watching him on television and the movies, and I never had a bad view of him.
[00:30:58.545 --> 00:31:02.587]  Until I began, about five years ago, to research who this guy is.
[00:31:03.996 --> 00:31:15.118]  He is a dangerous megalomaniac who has made public statements many times about how he wants to be a dictator, how he dreams of being a dictator, how he admires Hitler.
[00:31:15.118 --> 00:31:24.000]  He publicly has called multiple individuals racial slurs, like the N-word, at public events.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.761]  He admits to using illegal drugs.
[00:31:27.761 --> 00:31:30.722]  This is Arnold Alos Schwarzenegger.
[00:31:31.761 --> 00:31:38.823]  In fact, doing my research, I found out decades ago he said he wanted to be president, and that he would start off by being the governor of California.
[00:31:38.823 --> 00:31:52.906]  Then I learned that he'd spent much of his life in America marrying into the Kennedy family to get that bloodline going, and then going and becoming a member of elite Republican organizations like the Bohemian Grove in Northern California.
[00:31:52.906 --> 00:32:00.968]  Then I read where Karl Rove, the head Republican strategist, said, Arnold, we want you to run for governor, and they helped push him in, propel him into office.
[00:32:02.526 --> 00:32:12.849]  No one else could have this type of dirt on them and be elected governor unless they have the establishment on their side.
[00:32:12.849 --> 00:32:16.991]  Arnold Schwarzenegger is a danger to this country.
[00:32:16.991 --> 00:32:27.314]  Article 2, Clause 5 of the Constitution says you have to be native-born and 35 years of age to run for president.
[00:32:27.314 --> 00:32:30.835]  But Arnold has got his minions and his political operatives
[00:32:31.659 --> 00:32:35.281]  All over television for the last month, promoting this.
[00:32:35.281 --> 00:32:43.046]  Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, who told the San Jose Mercury News November 3rd that, well, Arnold's turned the corner.
[00:32:43.046 --> 00:32:44.467]  Arnold's turned the tide.
[00:32:44.467 --> 00:32:50.091]  Republican leadership wants him to run for president when Bush leaves office in 08.
[00:32:50.091 --> 00:32:56.515]  He's got Senator Orrin Hatch, he's got Senator Ted Kennedy, Senator John McCain, Jay Leno.
[00:32:56.515 --> 00:33:00.838]  Arnold himself has been on all these national TV shows saying, well, he does want the
[00:33:01.641 --> 00:33:06.623]  Constitution changed so he can run, but he's not thinking about it right now.
[00:33:06.623 --> 00:33:07.703]  Oh, really?
[00:33:07.703 --> 00:33:25.489]  You've got the former head of your finance committee out of California starting this group that's gotten unprecedented attention on almost every national television show out there promoting this amend the Constitution for Arnold.
[00:33:25.489 --> 00:33:29.570]  And it says, as a Christmas present to Arnold, let's amend the Constitution.
[00:33:30.757 --> 00:33:34.398]  And then when they're cornered on the subject, they go, oh, well, Arnold isn't behind it.
[00:33:34.398 --> 00:33:35.878]  Arnold doesn't want it.
[00:33:35.878 --> 00:33:41.240]  We're just a bunch of his former campaign people pushing for it.
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:47.941]  Arnold said dozens of times, going back over a decade, that he wants to amend the Constitution so he can be your president.
[00:33:47.941 --> 00:33:56.984]  Think about Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has said that he dreams of being a dictator, being worshipped.
[00:33:56.984 --> 00:33:58.404]  Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:33:59.341 --> 00:34:10.531]  Who has said he admires Hitler, and who campaigned for the top Nazi, Kurt Waltheim, in 86, in Austria, even when it was known that he was a top Nazi, in the middle of a scandal.
[00:34:10.531 --> 00:34:18.297]  Think about Arnold Schwarzenegger, in control of the most powerful country in the world, with the nuclear launch codes, the nuclear football.
[00:34:18.297 --> 00:34:25.403]  Think about Arnold Schwarzenegger, who says he wants to be a dictator, in that position of power.
[00:34:25.403 --> 00:34:27.465]  It is unacceptable!
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:31.763]  America is in danger.
[00:34:31.763 --> 00:34:35.807]  Dangerous elements of the elite are firmly behind him.
[00:34:35.807 --> 00:34:48.139]  They have openly introduced four separate pieces of legislation to start a constitutional convention to go to the states and rewrite
[00:34:48.982 --> 00:34:53.623]  Butcher the Constitution so a foreigner can be our president.
[00:34:53.623 --> 00:35:00.964]  And look, I'm against a foreigner being our president, along with 80-plus percent of the average Americans in major polls.
[00:35:00.964 --> 00:35:10.126]  Some polls, 98 percent, that we have posted at ArnoldExposed.com.
[00:35:10.126 --> 00:35:15.967]  But I'm really opposed to Arnold Schwarzenegger being our president.
[00:35:17.054 --> 00:35:18.535]  By the way, just a history lesson.
[00:35:18.535 --> 00:35:30.460]  Do you know why the Founding Fathers, when they ratified the Constitution in 1789, do you know why they put that clause into the Constitution?
[00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:35.903]  Because at that very time, truth is stranger than fiction, the Austrian
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:50.989]  This royal family had pre-positioned good-looking, smart, young, intelligent Austrian men in Poland, and France, and many other areas, actively trying to overthrow governments.
[00:35:50.989 --> 00:35:54.011]  And they were successful in Poland.
[00:35:54.011 --> 00:36:03.337]  Then again, in the 1930s, a young Austrian traveled to Germany, and later in 1933, became the Chancellor of Deutschland.
[00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:09.031]  And Arnold has a connection to that.
[00:36:09.031 --> 00:36:16.433]  His father was an SS officer who volunteered for the party in Austria when it was illegal.
[00:36:16.433 --> 00:36:18.833]  Oh, he was a team player.
[00:36:18.833 --> 00:36:21.314]  He was, you'd call, kind of a cheerleader.
[00:36:21.314 --> 00:36:25.695]  Then he became an SS officer with a reign of terror.
[00:36:25.695 --> 00:36:30.217]  But we say we can't blame Arnold for the sins of the father.
[00:36:30.217 --> 00:36:33.098]  Then Arnold goes out and campaigns for Nazis.
[00:36:33.098 --> 00:36:33.878]  Top Nazis.
[00:36:34.654 --> 00:36:40.336]  War criminals like Kurt Waldheim in the middle of a scandal when it's exposed that he was a top Nazi.
[00:36:40.336 --> 00:36:44.618]  He was on campaign posters for Waldheim in Austria.
[00:36:44.618 --> 00:36:49.399]  And Arnold has let it open that if he can't get elected president, he might be president of Austria.
[00:36:49.399 --> 00:36:54.401]  He hasn't given up his citizenship to Austria.
[00:36:54.401 --> 00:36:56.042]  He's got dual citizenship.
[00:36:56.042 --> 00:36:58.963]  There are hundreds of federal jobs you can't hold.
[00:36:58.963 --> 00:37:02.744]  You can't have a national security clearance if you're holding dual citizenship.
[00:37:04.173 --> 00:37:10.117]  He's unfit to be governor, and he's certainly unfit to be president.
[00:37:10.117 --> 00:37:20.944]  According to major magazine reports, Arnold will call people who aren't good-looking on movie sets dogs in the early 90s, and make them get down on their knees and say, I'm a dog.
[00:37:20.944 --> 00:37:29.089]  He went to bodybuilding events in the late 70s and would scream that black people didn't deserve to be in the competitions and that they were
[00:37:30.006 --> 00:37:31.206]  The N-word.
[00:37:31.206 --> 00:37:32.547]  In front of witnesses.
[00:37:32.547 --> 00:37:35.967]  It's been in the news, but always the back of the paper.
[00:37:35.967 --> 00:37:46.309]  Go to ArnoldExposed.com, where we catalogue his bizarre activities.
[00:37:46.309 --> 00:37:48.230]  And look at it for yourself.
[00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:51.330]  And he hasn't challenged any of it.
[00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:55.511]  Then we get into all the mass groping and sexual harassment.
[00:37:56.425 --> 00:38:03.090]  Grabbing on waitresses, things that would be considered sexual assault.
[00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:04.431]  He doesn't challenge it.
[00:38:04.431 --> 00:38:07.974]  He just says, we'll just smoke this fire.
[00:38:07.974 --> 00:38:10.836]  Arnold, go back to Austria.
[00:38:10.836 --> 00:38:16.120]  As your Nazi father would say, Auslander Reich, or foreigners out.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.122]  How about you get out of our country?
[00:38:18.122 --> 00:38:19.783]  This is America!
[00:38:19.783 --> 00:38:22.405]  And there's a lot of us that aren't fooled by you.
[00:38:23.317 --> 00:38:27.421]  We know you didn't defeat seven-and-a-half-foot-tall aliens in Predator.
[00:38:27.421 --> 00:38:30.303]  We know that you're not this real-life superhero.
[00:38:30.303 --> 00:38:37.129]  We know you're a bloated movie actor on a power trip who has said he dreams of being a dictator.
[00:38:37.129 --> 00:38:40.952]  Then go find some other country that wants you to be their dictator.
[00:38:40.952 --> 00:38:46.137]  No other nation in the world would even entertain having a foreigner.
[00:38:46.137 --> 00:38:49.540]  Someone who didn't move here until his late twenties.
[00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:50.941]  Someone who didn't become a citizen.
[00:38:51.841 --> 00:38:58.102]  Until the early 1980s, as their commander-in-chief.
[00:38:58.102 --> 00:38:59.923]  And there's another dangerous facet to this.
[00:38:59.923 --> 00:39:17.086]  If you read the medical inserts for anabolic steroids, which he admits he took, and which it's obvious he took, it can cause delusions of grandeur, one of the main side effects, and psychotic breaks.
[00:39:17.086 --> 00:39:19.447]  Permanent psychotic breaks.
[00:39:20.109 --> 00:39:22.250]  This guy's a workaholic machine.
[00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:30.215]  He's got his minions and pomps and front men and surrogates out all over television, wall-to-wall for the last month.
[00:39:30.215 --> 00:39:32.697]  I said years ago this guy would run for president.
[00:39:32.697 --> 00:39:36.199]  I knew he had the elite behind him, but I didn't know this soon or this fast.
[00:39:36.199 --> 00:39:37.680]  They're moving for 08.
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:39.521]  They're trying to amend the U.S.
[00:39:39.521 --> 00:39:43.664]  Constitution, Article 2, Clause 5.
[00:39:43.664 --> 00:39:45.585]  We've got to stop it.
[00:39:45.585 --> 00:39:47.947]  And that's what ArnoldExposed.com
[00:39:49.013 --> 00:39:56.338]  And the organization behind it that I've now founded, Americans Against Arnold, is going to do.
[00:39:56.338 --> 00:40:07.366]  Join us in this historic fight defending America from someone who says they admire Hitler and who has called black people in public the N-word.
[00:40:07.366 --> 00:40:13.691]  Someone who has been involved in massive sexual harassment and groping.
[00:40:14.341 --> 00:40:21.326]  Someone who is an out-of-control barbarian on a megalomaniacal power trip.
[00:40:21.326 --> 00:40:34.255]  If you love this country, you will stand up against this humiliating attempt that he and his minions are engaging in to amend the Constitution so he can run in 2008.
[00:40:34.255 --> 00:40:37.717]  Defend America against Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:40:37.717 --> 00:40:40.219]  They're trying to use a false grassroots movement.
[00:40:40.894 --> 00:40:49.543]  With millions of these big corporate dollars to copy MoveOn.org's operation and create a false grassroots movement.
[00:40:49.543 --> 00:41:01.597]  They're trying to get people to go out there and recruit their friends and then recruit their friends to have a national movement in the 38 states that are needed to repeal Article 2, Clause 5.
[00:41:01.597 --> 00:41:02.658]  But the polls show
[00:41:03.812 --> 00:41:10.815]  80-plus percent, eight-tenths of people in major polls do not think he should be able to run for president.
[00:41:10.815 --> 00:41:12.676]  They support Article 2, Clause 5.
[00:41:12.676 --> 00:41:25.301]  In fact, in a World Net Daily poll of conservatives, only 1.8 percent, or less than 2 percent, were for Arnold being able to run for president.
[00:41:25.301 --> 00:41:28.922]  But by the time the spinmasters are done, that's going to change.
[00:41:28.922 --> 00:41:31.663]  They're not out there working this hard for nothing.
[00:41:31.663 --> 00:41:33.324]  If the grassroots doesn't move,
[00:41:34.395 --> 00:41:45.746]  And if we don't educate people about what Arnold Schwarzenegger and his elite supporters and sponsors are, then this country is going to be in really deep trouble.
[00:41:45.746 --> 00:42:00.219]  My friends, rally to the call to stand up against this tyrant, this would-be tyrant, and help us defend this republic against this mighty peril.
[00:42:07.529 --> 00:42:11.111]  That was a piece for ArnoldExposed.com that I'll be posting tomorrow.
[00:42:11.111 --> 00:42:17.014]  I want to thank the local viewers for watching.
[00:42:17.014 --> 00:42:19.856]  You know, I grew up like everybody else.
[00:42:19.856 --> 00:42:21.116]  I thought Arnold was cool.
[00:42:21.116 --> 00:42:22.057]  Nothing against him.
[00:42:22.057 --> 00:42:24.278]  Interesting guy.
[00:42:24.278 --> 00:42:28.220]  Something uniquely, instinctively scary about him.
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:33.363]  I mean, you can really buy into him being this vicious creature he portrays in movies.
[00:42:33.363 --> 00:42:35.144]  And that's because he is!
[00:42:35.144 --> 00:42:35.584]  He is!
[00:42:37.071 --> 00:42:40.294]  What he poses to be.
[00:42:40.294 --> 00:42:42.696]  And I thought I knew about him two years ago.
[00:42:42.696 --> 00:42:52.825]  Then I started doing research when he ran for governor, and I was shocked and amazed that the media was not exposing this.
[00:42:52.825 --> 00:42:55.687]  And now they're not even talking about it at all.
[00:42:55.687 --> 00:42:58.850]  I mean, I've got his quotes here out of major magazines.
[00:42:58.850 --> 00:42:59.931]  This is Rolling Stones.
[00:43:00.683 --> 00:43:03.364]  I thought about the fame, about being the greatest.
[00:43:03.364 --> 00:43:07.544]  I was dreaming about being some dictator of a country or something.
[00:43:07.544 --> 00:43:09.965]  Some savior like Jesus.
[00:43:09.965 --> 00:43:12.145]  Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo.
[00:43:12.145 --> 00:43:15.346]  You do roids for decades, folks.
[00:43:15.346 --> 00:43:19.086]  You're fried.
[00:43:19.086 --> 00:43:22.807]  Now look at this photo of him on a total power trip.
[00:43:22.807 --> 00:43:25.188]  Arnold is numero uno, smoking dope.
[00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:30.431]  It just blows my mind.
[00:43:30.431 --> 00:43:33.532]  We have hundreds of articles about this guy.
[00:43:33.532 --> 00:43:43.435]  By the way, he's never challenged the premier magazine article where he's got 16-year-olds shacked up in these houses he pays for.
[00:43:43.435 --> 00:43:46.296]  16-year-old women.
[00:43:46.296 --> 00:43:52.958]  He hasn't challenged that he makes people get down and say, I'm an ugly dog on the sets of movies.
[00:43:52.958 --> 00:43:56.139]  He hasn't challenged any of this.
[00:43:59.151 --> 00:44:02.013]  I mean, no wonder the elite loves Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:44:02.013 --> 00:44:09.699]  He is the most pig-like, demonic, power-tripping creature I could even imagine.
[00:44:09.699 --> 00:44:11.280]  His father was a Nazi.
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:15.924]  When his dad died, his mother married the head of the Austrian Parliament, a former top Nazi.
[00:44:15.924 --> 00:44:17.665]  He's campaigning for top Nazis.
[00:44:17.665 --> 00:44:22.449]  He was over there in the late 90s, hanging out at the Austrian government with Waltheim.
[00:44:22.449 --> 00:44:25.571]  We got all those photos and news articles posted.
[00:44:29.446 --> 00:44:48.521]  And now he's got DMV chief that he just appointed wants to make Californians take satellite tracker boxes in their cars that'll tax them 25 cents a mile.
[00:44:48.521 --> 00:44:51.944]  Right now in California, the state tax is 18 cents a gallon.
[00:44:51.944 --> 00:44:56.807]  Average mileage, 22 miles to the gallon in California for 18 cents.
[00:44:58.806 --> 00:45:09.172]  Or you can increase that to 25 cents a mile over 25 times the current tax.
[00:45:09.172 --> 00:45:20.438]  And I hear these neocons like Clark Howard who give you the good financial advice on KLBJ the other night going, this is a great deal Governor Schwarzenegger has to tax you.
[00:45:20.438 --> 00:45:21.319]  It's a federal plan.
[00:45:21.319 --> 00:45:23.440]  I mean, what did I tell you about this eight years ago here on the show?
[00:45:24.227 --> 00:45:25.408]  And Oregon's putting it in.
[00:45:25.408 --> 00:45:26.608]  New York's putting it in.
[00:45:26.608 --> 00:45:30.149]  Austin, on a mini-scale, is going to have it with the new toll roads, a transponder.
[00:45:30.149 --> 00:45:37.432]  It'll cost you $1,800 a year, the city admits on average, through a state program and Governor Rick Perry.
[00:45:37.432 --> 00:45:39.893]  And we've got this, we've got this huge agenda.
[00:45:39.893 --> 00:45:41.314]  We've got this huge agenda.
[00:45:41.314 --> 00:45:47.376]  Here's the LA Times, a couple days ago about this, posted on Infowars.net.
[00:45:47.376 --> 00:45:50.097]  DMV chief.
[00:45:50.097 --> 00:45:51.438]  Fax, tax, by the mile.
[00:45:54.284 --> 00:46:00.129]  And they've got this weird statement here that, well, Arnold did appoint this guy, but Arnold isn't commenting on the proposal.
[00:46:00.129 --> 00:46:01.970]  I mean, Arnold doesn't comment on anything.
[00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:06.094]  He has his surrogates go out and push him for governor, last minute he announces.
[00:46:06.094 --> 00:46:14.861]  He has his surrogates go out and, well, I do think we should repeal the Constitution area so I can be your president, but I'm not worried about that right now.
[00:46:14.861 --> 00:46:17.963]  I'm busy working for California.
[00:46:17.963 --> 00:46:21.606]  All he's been doing is out campaigning to be able to run for president.
[00:46:24.665 --> 00:46:35.333]  And what they're going to do so that you'll go along with him running for president is they'll give you an offer you can't refuse.
[00:46:35.333 --> 00:46:38.195]  They're going to run him against Hillary in 2008.
[00:46:38.195 --> 00:46:39.997]  This is already coming out public.
[00:46:39.997 --> 00:46:41.198]  I said it months ago.
[00:46:41.198 --> 00:46:43.840]  Just because I can analyze what they're doing, it's not hard to do.
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.222]  You spend your life studying this.
[00:46:46.222 --> 00:46:49.744]  But they're going to run him against her, who's wildly unpopular.
[00:46:49.744 --> 00:46:52.506]  She would clearly lose by 20 points in an election.
[00:46:52.506 --> 00:46:53.187]  Horrible creature.
[00:46:53.979 --> 00:47:03.623]  So they're going to run a wart-covered hobgoblin against a demonic pig monster, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and it shows he'll win against her.
[00:47:03.623 --> 00:47:10.365]  And so they're going to get a con-con going, a constitutional convention.
[00:47:10.365 --> 00:47:15.107]  In fact, a lot of you... This is an important point we need to make.
[00:47:16.048 --> 00:47:19.310]  A lot of you are thinking, hey, they can't repeal the Constitution.
[00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:20.431]  That's not going to happen.
[00:47:20.431 --> 00:47:22.932]  That's what his minions are now proposing.
[00:47:22.932 --> 00:47:35.039]  And they've got all sorts of discussions going in Congress and legislation to start a constitutional convention for gay marriage or on other issues like a sales tax.
[00:47:35.039 --> 00:47:41.683]  They've got different bills going to have a constitutional convention for flag burning.
[00:47:42.563 --> 00:47:51.725]  But once a constitutional convention starts, they can rewrite the whole Bill of Rights, the whole Constitution.
[00:47:51.725 --> 00:47:55.186]  And so you're going to have a con con in the next few years.
[00:47:55.186 --> 00:48:02.948]  And Arnold and his people are there with the legislation, tagged on, to have it then go to the states, so he can run for president.
[00:48:02.948 --> 00:48:07.909]  And once he gets that amendment passed, it's over.
[00:48:08.763 --> 00:48:12.345]  Because the machine, the media machine, will kick into gear.
[00:48:12.345 --> 00:48:17.868]  The same corporate media machine that's been covering up what Arnold publicly is.
[00:48:17.868 --> 00:48:19.409]  And we're all going to be in deep trouble.
[00:48:19.409 --> 00:48:23.392]  So we've got to fight a constitutional convention at the state level.
[00:48:23.392 --> 00:48:28.635]  That's exactly where Arnold's people, with big money, are now being dispatched.
[00:48:28.635 --> 00:48:34.018]  But we have the people, and the Constitution, and the Founding Fathers on our side.
[00:48:34.018 --> 00:48:37.340]  We have the majority of the people.
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:37.860]  We have
[00:48:38.914 --> 00:48:44.496]  The fact that Arnold has all this dirt on him, and we're going to defeat them.
[00:48:44.496 --> 00:48:51.619]  I'll tell you what we'll do for the balance of the broadcast.
[00:48:51.619 --> 00:48:57.441]  We'll, uh... We'll take some calls.
[00:48:57.441 --> 00:49:04.664]  But... I just can't stress to you how much this freaks me out.
[00:49:04.664 --> 00:49:06.105]  This is a nightmare coming true.
[00:49:07.097 --> 00:49:12.041]  A guy's gonna have the nuclear football, the nuclear codes, who says he wants to be a dictator.
[00:49:12.041 --> 00:49:14.363]  All these different magazines and publications.
[00:49:14.363 --> 00:49:21.309]  Who says he's dreamed of being a dictator and how he admires Hitler.
[00:49:21.309 --> 00:49:24.631]  They're gonna give him... Think about this.
[00:49:24.631 --> 00:49:30.136]  Arnold Schwarzenegger, if he becomes president, won't just have the nuclear football, but this megalomaniac
[00:49:30.859 --> 00:49:33.060]  He's going to have control of our military.
[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:37.220]  He's going to have control over Patriot Act 1 and Patriot Act 2.
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:46.082]  He's the perfect leader for a corrupt establishment that wants America to have a new king over its police state.
[00:49:46.082 --> 00:49:48.103]  And everybody I talk to agrees.
[00:49:48.103 --> 00:49:50.823]  Radio talk show callers, people on the street.
[00:49:50.823 --> 00:49:53.084]  There is something so scary about Arnold.
[00:49:53.084 --> 00:49:54.304]  Your instincts are right.
[00:49:54.304 --> 00:49:57.605]  When you research this guy, he is a bottomless pit of evil.
[00:49:58.374 --> 00:50:00.915]  Oh, and that's another point about Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:50:00.915 --> 00:50:04.737]  He tells you his name means Black Plowman.
[00:50:04.737 --> 00:50:12.320]  Well, we checked in a German dictionary the real meaning of Schwarzenegger.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:15.741]  It means darkness of the darkness.
[00:50:15.741 --> 00:50:26.545]  And, yeah, I've never seen a politician with this much dirt out of the gates, this much desire for unbridled power, than we see with Arnold Alos.
[00:50:26.545 --> 00:50:27.866]  Darkness of the darkness.
[00:50:28.812 --> 00:50:35.718]  Schwarzenegger, pitch black Schwarzenegger, with a pitch black heart, power mad.
[00:50:35.718 --> 00:50:38.500]  We must stand against him.
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:55.193]  So join us at ArnoldExposed.com and join the nationwide movement of Americans against Arnold and Americans in support of Article 2, Clause 5 of the United States Constitution.
[00:50:55.193 --> 00:50:58.136]  We're not going to let some outlander, some foreigner,
[00:50:59.167 --> 00:51:01.448]  Somebody who admires Hitler!
[00:51:01.448 --> 00:51:05.649]  Take over our country!
[00:51:05.649 --> 00:51:15.012]  And something else I'd ask all of you to do is to go to ArnoldExposed.com and to email it to every TV and radio station.
[00:51:15.012 --> 00:51:17.453]  Every Austin TV and radio station.
[00:51:17.453 --> 00:51:18.573]  Every newspaper.
[00:51:18.573 --> 00:51:20.654]  Pick a few newspapers in other states.
[00:51:20.654 --> 00:51:21.614]  The LA Times.
[00:51:21.614 --> 00:51:22.454]  We're doing it.
[00:51:22.454 --> 00:51:24.615]  We just launched this as this show began.
[00:51:25.313 --> 00:51:26.875]  Help us.
[00:51:26.875 --> 00:51:29.737]  They don't care if the polls show 80% of you are against him.
[00:51:29.737 --> 00:51:30.818]  And in some polls, 98.2%.
[00:51:30.818 --> 00:51:35.102]  We have these polls posted.
[00:51:35.102 --> 00:51:44.431]  All the claims I've made are posted on ArnoldExposed.com and the Arnold section of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:51:44.431 --> 00:51:47.294]  And that's another important point you should be aware of.
[00:51:47.294 --> 00:51:48.415]  Every claim we've made
[00:51:49.702 --> 00:51:51.223]  Don't believe us!
[00:51:51.223 --> 00:51:54.665]  Go check out what this creature is for yourself!
[00:51:54.665 --> 00:51:55.726]  And say no to him!
[00:52:21.072 --> 00:52:23.073]  I'm getting no audio in here.
[00:52:23.073 --> 00:52:25.773]  Go ahead, caller.
[00:52:25.773 --> 00:52:26.954]  Go ahead, caller.
[00:52:26.954 --> 00:52:28.674]  Yeah, the phone system's down.
[00:52:28.674 --> 00:52:39.477]  So, uh, we'll, I'm sorry to all the callers, this happens a couple times a year, and, uh, we'll, uh, we'll, uh, get some help on this problem.
[00:52:39.477 --> 00:52:41.697]  Doesn't even matter.
[00:52:41.697 --> 00:52:48.159]  You know, I've studied psychology a little bit, and I've read a lot of different industry
[00:52:51.095 --> 00:52:59.499]  Publications that... We're just not going to take any calls, so thank you.
[00:52:59.499 --> 00:53:00.119]  We're done.
[00:53:00.119 --> 00:53:00.619]  Thank you.
[00:53:00.619 --> 00:53:00.980]  I'm sorry.
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:02.500]  If this doesn't work, I apologize.
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:04.061]  We're not taking calls.
[00:53:04.061 --> 00:53:10.304]  Thanks.
[00:53:10.304 --> 00:53:11.705]  So we'll go ahead and take that number down.
[00:53:11.705 --> 00:53:12.085]  Thank you.
[00:53:21.744 --> 00:53:24.327]  I've studied psychology somewhat.
[00:53:24.327 --> 00:53:28.972]  Archetypal psychology.
[00:53:28.972 --> 00:53:37.962]  And it's like a woman in high school who wants to go out with a guy who wears a leather jacket and who's a criminal and who abuses her.
[00:53:37.962 --> 00:53:40.164]  The best looking girl wants him.
[00:53:40.164 --> 00:53:41.445]  There's that mystery.
[00:53:41.445 --> 00:53:42.487]  There's that danger.
[00:53:42.487 --> 00:53:43.628]  There's that abusiveness.
[00:53:47.951 --> 00:53:53.573]  And a lot of advertising specialists say nothing sells like Hitler.
[00:53:53.573 --> 00:53:57.714]  Look at that!
[00:53:57.714 --> 00:53:59.015]  We are not going to take any calls.
[00:53:59.015 --> 00:54:00.635]  We're having phone problems.
[00:54:00.635 --> 00:54:02.476]  Somebody keeps airing calls in there.
[00:54:02.476 --> 00:54:04.517]  I'd ask them to stop.
[00:54:04.517 --> 00:54:06.557]  Thank you.
[00:54:06.557 --> 00:54:11.099]  I'm going to try to restate this again for the third time.
[00:54:11.099 --> 00:54:11.979]  I apologize.
[00:54:19.471 --> 00:54:22.772]  All right.
[00:54:22.772 --> 00:54:24.732]  Our whole country's in jeopardy.
[00:54:24.732 --> 00:54:26.093]  We're losing this nation.
[00:54:26.093 --> 00:54:38.856]  Bush is trying to appoint people to the Attorney General ship who openly write memos saying Bush is above the law and torture's good, and that any citizen can be arrested for no reason to be taken to a camp and tortured.
[00:54:38.856 --> 00:54:40.416]  Alberto Gonzales.
[00:54:40.416 --> 00:54:46.957]  We have the states openly, what I warned you about six years ago, coming in with the satellite tracker boxes in the cars.
[00:54:46.957 --> 00:54:48.218]  Look, it's all happening.
[00:54:48.218 --> 00:54:49.098]  We're down to the wire.
[00:54:50.743 --> 00:54:52.324]  And the people's instincts are right.
[00:54:52.324 --> 00:54:56.805]  We know people like Arnold Schwarzenegger are bad.
[00:54:56.805 --> 00:55:02.406]  We know that.
[00:55:02.406 --> 00:55:09.229]  We understand that.
[00:55:09.229 --> 00:55:12.389]  God help us.
[00:55:12.389 --> 00:55:14.250]  God help us.
[00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:15.770]  Let me start over again.
[00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:17.111]  And I may be able to get it out this time.
[00:55:17.111 --> 00:55:17.611]  I'm gonna try again.
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:26.762]  You know the girl in high school.
[00:55:26.762 --> 00:55:28.362]  Best looking in the school.
[00:55:28.362 --> 00:55:30.023]  Good family.
[00:55:30.023 --> 00:55:36.424]  She wants to go out with a guy that beats her up, who wears a leather jacket, who's been caught stealing cars.
[00:55:36.424 --> 00:55:40.826]  She likes the mystery, the danger, the so-called rebellion.
[00:55:40.826 --> 00:55:43.206]  She wants to be abused.
[00:55:43.206 --> 00:55:47.848]  She doesn't want the good man that's going to take care of her and love her.
[00:55:47.848 --> 00:55:48.788]  A lot of girls are like that.
[00:55:50.552 --> 00:55:57.696]  And it was Hitler that said society and the public are like a woman.
[00:55:57.696 --> 00:56:04.959]  A lot of top advertising psychologists and sociologists and experts have noted that nothing sells like Hitler.
[00:56:04.959 --> 00:56:09.381]  History Channel, Discovery Channel, the movies... Hitler!
[00:56:09.381 --> 00:56:10.862]  Nothing gets ratings like Hitler.
[00:56:10.862 --> 00:56:12.443]  People never get sick of Hitler.
[00:56:12.443 --> 00:56:19.126]  The precision, the marching, the black boots, the palpable evil of the beast man.
[00:56:20.129 --> 00:56:26.194]  Nietzsche's beast man that people like Arnold Schwarzenegger are the quintessential model of.
[00:56:26.194 --> 00:56:31.998]  An arrogant, power-filled, domineering, control-free.
[00:56:31.998 --> 00:56:36.982]  And America has entered a very decadent, sick phase.
[00:56:36.982 --> 00:56:38.623]  And America is drunk with evil.
[00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:43.171]  That is large segments of it.
[00:56:43.171 --> 00:56:45.511]  And so people are flirting with doom.
[00:56:45.511 --> 00:56:53.494]  They know Arnold's a Nazi, they know he's evil, they know he's corrupt, especially our elite does, and they get off on it.
[00:56:53.494 --> 00:56:55.855]  There's a love affair with it.
[00:56:55.855 --> 00:57:02.277]  There's a need to have a war king, a war god, this archetypal image.
[00:57:02.277 --> 00:57:09.820]  But it's dangerous, and it's destructive, and it's bad, and Arnold himself is an arrogant, narcissistic twit.
[00:57:12.705 --> 00:57:20.289]  And to see them take him with all the dirt and all the problems and all the corruption and hold him up and push him on us.
[00:57:20.289 --> 00:57:24.171]  It'd be bad enough to have some other foreigner being lined up to be our president.
[00:57:24.171 --> 00:57:27.653]  But Arnold Schwarzenegger, it's a joke!
[00:57:27.653 --> 00:57:29.114]  But it's because he's archetypal.
[00:57:32.941 --> 00:57:41.027]  It's because he is the darkness of the darkness, as his name means, that so many people in the establishment and in the media are behind it.
[00:57:41.027 --> 00:57:47.132]  And because he goes after, viciously, with all sorts of different reprisals, anybody that goes against him.
[00:57:47.132 --> 00:57:48.493]  Well, I don't care!
[00:57:48.493 --> 00:57:51.895]  I'm going against Arnold Schwarzenegger!
[00:57:51.895 --> 00:57:52.115]  110%!
[00:57:52.115 --> 00:57:56.959]  Because I know he's a danger to this country, and I'm not going to let him get the nuclear football!
[00:58:00.655 --> 00:58:03.998]  Because there's never enough for people like him and Hitler and Stalin.
[00:58:03.998 --> 00:58:05.038]  They always want more.
[00:58:05.038 --> 00:58:07.620]  If he became president, he'd want to become emperor.
[00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:10.543]  It's like Bill Clinton, the sociopath, control freak.
[00:58:10.543 --> 00:58:17.568]  He wants to be secretary-general, and they admit that's all lined up for him when coffee-anon leaves in a year and a half.
[00:58:17.568 --> 00:58:24.934]  We don't want to end up with Bill Clinton at the UN and Arnold Schwarzenegger in 08.
[00:58:24.934 --> 00:58:26.395]  And he's got the elite behind him.
[00:58:26.395 --> 00:58:30.238]  He's out at the Rothschild Castle in major British newspapers.
[00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:36.854]  He's hanging out with kingmakers like George Shultz.
[00:58:36.854 --> 00:58:42.618]  Again, he's hanging out with all these kingmakers like George Shultz.
[00:58:42.618 --> 00:58:58.429]  He's running around and this whole troupe of sycophants and people behind Arnold Schwarzenegger, because our elite is so degenerate and so decadent, the citizenry doesn't even hold a candle to them, that they're enamored with this beast man.
[00:58:59.457 --> 00:59:10.426]  With this person that talks about little people being nothing, and how he despises them, and how he's a fuhrer, he's a leader, he's gonna be a dictator, he's gonna be your president.
[00:59:10.426 --> 00:59:12.108]  No!
[00:59:12.108 --> 00:59:14.149]  He's been pulling strings for decades.
[00:59:14.149 --> 00:59:19.934]  They have lots of little lines in movies about how Arnold's gonna be our president, in movies like Demolition Man.
[00:59:19.934 --> 00:59:21.235]  Don't put up with it.
[00:59:21.235 --> 00:59:22.456]  Stand against it.
[00:59:22.456 --> 00:59:25.579]  Go to ArnoldExposed.com.
[00:59:25.579 --> 00:59:26.620]  Email the URL.
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:29.461]  Email the banners we've got for the site.
[00:59:29.461 --> 00:59:30.701]  Put them on your site.
[00:59:30.701 --> 00:59:32.081]  Get them out to everybody.
[00:59:32.081 --> 00:59:33.502]  Let's see who'll win this.
[00:59:33.502 --> 00:59:40.364]  The people in the grassroots who instinctively are against Arnold, or the general public?
[00:59:40.364 --> 00:59:42.625]  I want to thank all of you who've supported us through the years.
[00:59:42.625 --> 00:59:46.306]  I want to thank all of you that have faithfully watched and researched our claims.
[00:59:46.306 --> 00:59:48.946]  I want to thank those running the show.
[00:59:48.946 --> 00:59:53.528]  Sorry we couldn't take calls tonight, but stuff's pretty shoddy down here at Little Access TV.
[00:59:55.302 --> 01:00:01.524]  We've defeated legislation at the federal and local level through this show because you took action.
[01:00:01.524 --> 01:00:15.208]  With my radio show and with this show, with the interviews I'll do, with the information we posted on the website, and with you taking action and emailing those stories and links out to all the mainstream media, it's unstoppable.
[01:00:15.208 --> 01:00:19.749]  If Arnold is going to be our dictator, then we should all at least know what he truly is.
[01:00:20.589 --> 01:00:25.230]  Somebody who makes his staff get down and call themselves ugly dogs.
[01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:28.691]  Somebody who likes to have people grovel at his feet.
[01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:40.455]  Somebody who, obviously, if he wasn't born that way, has had a psychotic break from steroid use on a megalomaniacal, uh, schizoid problem.
[01:00:40.455 --> 01:00:41.215]  God bless you all.
[01:00:41.215 --> 01:00:45.696]  My radio show, Retransmission, starts in 10 seconds at InfoWars.com.
[01:00:46.317 --> 01:00:47.118]  Please spread the word.
[01:00:47.118 --> 01:00:48.539]  I'm asking for your help.
[01:00:48.539 --> 01:00:49.659]  ArnoldExposed.com
[01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:16.760]  Tonight!
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:17.521]  Fuck that.
