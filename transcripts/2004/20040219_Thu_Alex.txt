[00:00:06.437 --> 00:00:07.097]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.758 --> 00:00:08.818]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.538 --> 00:00:10.638]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:11.278 --> 00:00:12.098]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:14.779]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.100]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.721]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:32.303]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:32.623 --> 00:00:33.863]  Another live edition...
[00:00:35.021 --> 00:00:38.964]  Of the Alex Jones Show, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:39.104 --> 00:00:43.227]  It is Monday, the 16th day of February 2004.
[00:00:43.307 --> 00:00:46.309]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:49.491]  I do this show Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:50.972]  until 2 p.m.
[00:00:51.312 --> 00:00:53.734]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:00:54.094 --> 00:00:56.115]  And I rebroadcast, of course, from 1 a.m.
[00:00:56.135 --> 00:01:00.218]  to 4 a.m., so that's Central Time as well, nine hours a day.
[00:01:00.298 --> 00:01:01.879]  No excuse to miss the broadcast.
[00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:07.276]  In the third hour of the show, I've got Hutton Gibson coming back on the broadcast.
[00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:13.959]  We got him on a few weeks ago, and an hour wasn't enough time to, well, go over the state of affairs in the world.
[00:01:14.019 --> 00:01:16.681]  And Hutton Gibson is an expert.
[00:01:16.781 --> 00:01:23.744]  He's been exposing it for decades on the takeover of the Roman Catholic Church by the forces of the New World Order.
[00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:28.426]  We'll be talking about that and other issues in the third hour today.
[00:01:29.167 --> 00:01:31.708]  Coming up here in about ten minutes, Texas Church...
[00:01:32.935 --> 00:01:36.977]  ...tries guns for roses on Valentine's from ABC News.
[00:01:38.558 --> 00:01:42.401]  They got people to turn their guns in with armed police standing around.
[00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:46.703]  They said it's the Christian thing to do, which is, of course, totally false.
[00:01:47.824 --> 00:01:53.748]  Not defending your family is one of the worst things you can do, and having an armed society keeps the criminals at bay.
[00:01:54.128 --> 00:01:59.011]  Having a disarmed society does the opposite, but that's coming up here in the next segment.
[00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:00.892]  You're not going to want to miss that.
[00:02:02.335 --> 00:02:08.682]  And, of course, we've got news from all over the world and what's happening with the police state here domestically as well.
[00:02:10.725 --> 00:02:19.135]  Now, the websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and they've both been updated for you today.
[00:02:19.595 --> 00:02:20.877]  Oh, and a side note.
[00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:33.004]  Hosted on InfoWars.com, we have a banner that links to the Passion website, the Passion of Christ website, and that's coming out on the 25th.
[00:02:34.224 --> 00:02:38.906]  The 25th, here in just about, well, less than a week and a half.
[00:02:39.867 --> 00:02:41.807]  And I know I'm going to be there the first day it comes out.
[00:02:42.388 --> 00:02:50.531]  And we're going to go over some of the hit pieces that have been written against the film and how that's backfiring on those that don't want you to see this movie.
[00:02:51.331 --> 00:03:06.276]  But you can link through to the particular subsection on Mel Gibson's Icon Production website and get free movie posters and free handbills of flyers to promote the film.
[00:03:06.596 --> 00:03:07.237]  They're free!
[00:03:08.037 --> 00:03:12.558]  And we've got that link there to the site if you want to help promote the film.
[00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:17.480]  If you order them now, you'll probably get them before the movie even comes out or certainly right after it comes out.
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.541]  You can hand those out at your church.
[00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.114]  Or give them to your neighbors or put them on people's car windshields.
[00:03:24.594 --> 00:03:27.297]  That'll certainly infuriate the globalists as well.
[00:03:27.417 --> 00:03:30.380]  So go to InfoWars.com.
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.761]  I know it's being updated right now.
[00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:34.463]  And that banner will be up there for you.
[00:03:35.124 --> 00:03:37.907]  By the way, I talked to Hutton Gibson yesterday for about 30 minutes.
[00:03:39.794 --> 00:03:42.057]  And let's just say this.
[00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:52.369]  You're going to want to watch Mel Gibson on Diane Sawyer's primetime ABC tonight at 10 o'clock Eastern, 9 o'clock Central.
[00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:54.972]  We're not going to steal Mel Gibson's thunder.
[00:03:54.992 --> 00:03:58.516]  I mean, Hutton told me about what Mel said in the interview.
[00:03:59.498 --> 00:04:03.681]  We're not going to steal his thunder here on the show and tell you what he said.
[00:04:04.101 --> 00:04:12.146]  In fact, they interviewed Mel for over three and a half hours, Hutton said, and it's only a 30-minute piece, and you take the ads out, it's probably even shorter than that.
[00:04:12.907 --> 00:04:24.334]  But if they don't include what Mel said, and I mean this is bombshell stuff, in this Diane Sawyer CFR piece, believe me, you're going to hear about it on this show tomorrow.
[00:04:25.556 --> 00:04:29.199]  Because we're not going to let them get away with their normal activities.
[00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:31.900]  Diane Sawyer, of course, is pure New World Order.
[00:04:32.361 --> 00:04:34.302]  One of the biggest gun grabbers in Washington.
[00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:41.271]  And she's a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, so there's no telling what they'll do with this piece tonight.
[00:04:41.871 --> 00:04:48.418]  But I'm going to be up late working on a new film, so I'm going to tape it and watch it when I get home after midnight tonight.
[00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:55.105]  So if they edit out the key stuff Mel was saying in this interview, we'll tell you about it tomorrow.
[00:04:55.906 --> 00:04:56.807]  All right, stay with us.
[00:04:56.827 --> 00:04:57.808]  A bunch of news coming up.
[00:04:57.848 --> 00:04:58.449]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:01.669]  Did you know you've been cheated?
[00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:04.210]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.011]  You heard that right.
[00:05:05.091 --> 00:05:07.572]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[00:05:07.732 --> 00:05:08.672]  You don't have to pay them off.
[00:05:08.912 --> 00:05:10.193]  The banks are defrauding you.
[00:05:10.473 --> 00:05:11.993]  Now is the time to fight back.
[00:05:12.273 --> 00:05:14.974]  You can completely waive out your credit card debt fast.
[00:05:15.195 --> 00:05:18.916]  The procedure's easy, and everything is done legally and within the law.
[00:05:19.116 --> 00:05:20.497]  Almost no one has ever failed.

[00:06:00.535 --> 00:06:04.016]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:06:04.276 --> 00:06:07.798]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:06:07.878 --> 00:06:11.819]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:18.201]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:18.601 --> 00:06:26.524]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:06:26.924 --> 00:06:32.288]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:06:32.428 --> 00:06:36.191]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:36.571 --> 00:06:38.433]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:06:38.493 --> 00:06:40.655]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:06:40.895 --> 00:06:45.838]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:07.474]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:07:07.754 --> 00:07:12.497]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:07:12.717 --> 00:07:18.361]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:07:18.601 --> 00:07:23.125]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:07:23.345 --> 00:07:30.511]  The casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:07:30.532 --> 00:07:35.055]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:07:35.216 --> 00:07:37.718]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:44.684]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:07:44.984 --> 00:07:46.966]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:46.986 --> 00:07:48.607]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.733 --> 00:08:24.998]  Well, my friends, we're breaking open yet another week of broadcast of resistance to tyranny, defense of liberty, and all the things that have made our constitutional republic so great.
[00:08:26.398 --> 00:08:31.960]  Coming up here in just a few minutes, Texas Church tries guns for roses on Valentine's.
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.121]  Turn your guns in.
[00:08:33.181 --> 00:08:34.901]  It's the Christian thing to do.
[00:08:34.961 --> 00:08:36.222]  We've got the pastor coming on.
[00:08:37.205 --> 00:08:38.366]  Then, some good news.
[00:08:38.886 --> 00:08:47.854]  State House passes bill outlawing abortion support in Senate for measure challenging Roe v. Wade decision.
[00:08:48.655 --> 00:08:50.797]  And this is out of South Dakota.
[00:08:51.097 --> 00:08:53.599]  And it'll cause another Supreme Court case.
[00:08:54.119 --> 00:08:57.162]  We'll see if the seven Republican appointed members of the U.S.
[00:08:57.182 --> 00:09:03.507]  Supreme Court will strike down abortion in this country.
[00:09:04.868 --> 00:09:05.269]  Also,
[00:09:06.184 --> 00:09:08.784]  We know this is going to be a skull and bones election.
[00:09:08.824 --> 00:09:17.886]  We've got George W. Bush, the skull and bones member, and we've got Kerry out front winning all the big primaries so far for the Democratic nomination.
[00:09:19.026 --> 00:09:25.587]  Well, now Dean is discussing dropping out and plans to back Kerry.
[00:09:27.028 --> 00:09:28.068]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:09:28.168 --> 00:09:31.308]  So it looks like Kerry is the man.
[00:09:31.368 --> 00:09:34.129]  So we'll have George W. Bush and John Forbes Kerry.
[00:09:35.437 --> 00:09:36.718]  We're about to go to our guest.
[00:09:36.758 --> 00:09:38.520]  This is an ABC News story.
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.743]  It's at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:09:43.163 --> 00:09:47.026]  Texas Church tries guns for roses on Valentine's Day.
[00:09:47.546 --> 00:09:54.791]  I've seen articles where Catholic churches, Protestant churches, you name it, have these gun buyback or turn your gun in events.
[00:09:54.831 --> 00:09:58.254]  They put on United Nations Days here in Austin.
[00:09:58.294 --> 00:10:01.356]  Local Baptist church does and tells you to turn your guns in.
[00:10:02.466 --> 00:10:08.947]  A church in Dallas, Texas wants people to show their love by giving up their guns this Valentine's Day, which they did.
[00:10:09.768 --> 00:10:16.729]  The First Presbyterian Church in Dallas is sponsoring a program for people to turn in their guns to mark the celebration of love.
[00:10:17.869 --> 00:10:26.191]  The sponsors will be given $50 for each gun and would be glad if the cash was used to purchase candy or flowers for Valentine's Day.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:40.306]  We're not trying to disarm Cupid of his bow and arrow, but provide another meaningful opportunity for individuals to show their affection for their families by making their homes safe this Valentine's Day, said church pastor Bruce Buchanan.
[00:10:41.087 --> 00:10:54.593]  The church has sponsored gun buybacks before, but pastor Buchanan said he has moved the program to Valentine's Day because most of the people who turned in guns had families and they did not want the guns in the homes.
[00:10:55.197 --> 00:11:01.862]  The church is aiming to buy back 150 guns, and to tell us how this went is Pastor Bruce Buchanan.
[00:11:02.182 --> 00:11:03.603]  Pastor, thanks for coming on the show.
[00:11:03.983 --> 00:11:04.764]  Thanks for having me.
[00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:07.686]  So, how did the gun buyback go?
[00:11:08.106 --> 00:11:14.011]  Well, it was very snowy and cold here in Dallas on Valentine's Day, but we held the gun buyback.
[00:11:14.031 --> 00:11:17.213]  This was the seventh one we've done in about three years.
[00:11:18.834 --> 00:11:22.897]  We had 59 rifles and handguns turned in that day.
[00:11:25.223 --> 00:11:27.464]  And were those by members of your church, mainly?
[00:11:28.624 --> 00:11:31.785]  Actually, I don't believe there were any members of my church this time.
[00:11:31.825 --> 00:11:40.608]  There have been in previous occasions that have turned in a weapon, but this time, no, there were no church members that I was aware of.
[00:11:41.428 --> 00:11:44.249]  Are you a member of any gun control organization?
[00:11:44.589 --> 00:11:45.089]  No, I'm not.
[00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:47.430]  Who approached you?
[00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.671]  You said you've had seven of these over the last few years.
[00:11:49.691 --> 00:11:50.571]  When did you start this?
[00:11:51.522 --> 00:12:07.235]  Well, in the Presbyterian Church USA, there has been for about almost 20 years now a peacemaking program in the church that's observed on the first Sunday in October.
[00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:22.953]  And churches are encouraged to be involved in local peacemaking efforts, and for many churches that involves, say, supporting a domestic violence shelter or some other initiative in the community that helps in that general area.
[00:12:23.273 --> 00:12:31.836]  Here in this church about three years ago, one of our church members suggested that we use part of that offering to sponsor buyback, and that's what started it.
[00:12:32.532 --> 00:12:37.573]  And ever since then, it's funds from people in the community have come in.
[00:12:38.053 --> 00:12:43.274]  It doesn't come from church funds to support the program and to keep it going.
[00:12:43.494 --> 00:12:45.175]  You say funds in the community.
[00:12:45.195 --> 00:12:46.235]  What organizations?
[00:12:46.535 --> 00:12:47.495]  No organizations.
[00:12:47.535 --> 00:12:48.155]  Individuals.
[00:12:48.975 --> 00:12:56.537]  The Presbytery did send us a donation this year that's like the diocese of the Presbyterian Church, the Presbytery.
[00:12:57.719 --> 00:13:02.861]  Okay, well let me just be, Pastor, we appreciate you coming on, but let me just be up front with you.
[00:13:04.522 --> 00:13:14.085]  Number one, when one of the disciples at the Garden of Gethsemane cut the ear off the Roman, Christ put it back on and said, next time sell your cloak and buy swords.
[00:13:15.066 --> 00:13:16.826]  But let's elaborate on this.
[00:13:17.286 --> 00:13:19.727]  New York, D.C., they have gun bans.
[00:13:19.767 --> 00:13:21.168]  I don't remember Christ saying that.
[00:13:21.878 --> 00:13:23.719]  Oh, he didn't say sell your cloak and buy a sword?
[00:13:23.979 --> 00:13:26.380]  No, I don't remember reading that in the gospel.
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.500]  You've got to be kidding.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.040]  No.
[00:13:29.361 --> 00:13:30.261]  You're joking, right?
[00:13:30.941 --> 00:13:31.442]  No, I'm not.
[00:13:31.682 --> 00:13:33.723]  Actually, I've got a Bible here on the shelf.
[00:13:33.743 --> 00:13:34.803]  Go ahead and make your point.
[00:13:36.411 --> 00:13:36.751]  Okay.
[00:13:37.512 --> 00:13:39.893]  Well, New York and D.C.
[00:13:39.933 --> 00:13:44.556]  and other areas with gun bans have the highest crime rates because I love my family.
[00:13:44.716 --> 00:13:48.238]  I'm armed to protect them from criminals.
[00:13:48.798 --> 00:13:52.800]  And that's why areas with high gun ownership have the lowest crime rates.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.581]  And, you know, Hitler was for gun control.
[00:13:55.061 --> 00:14:04.366]  I think you've got a lot of useful dupes out there who are paving the road to hell by pushing this whole disarmament move.
[00:14:04.667 --> 00:14:05.067]  Comments?
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:13.843]  Well, we did not force anyone to come and turn in their handgun or their rifle.
[00:14:14.403 --> 00:14:24.388]  And there are people who are involved in this program and have been involved in the program from the beginning who are strong supporters of the Second Amendment.
[00:14:24.408 --> 00:14:26.089]  But you imply, Pastor?
[00:14:26.129 --> 00:14:32.411]  If I may finish, that strongly support the Second Amendment and are gun enthusiasts themselves.
[00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:34.092]  In fact, they are gun experts.
[00:14:34.801 --> 00:14:38.304]  Who disables the weapons when they're turned in is a gun enthusiast.
[00:14:38.664 --> 00:14:48.011]  And so by far, we have collected in all those seven events about 300 handguns and rifles.
[00:14:48.832 --> 00:14:56.378]  And my experience has been that many of them come from women, which is a surprise.
[00:14:58.032 --> 00:15:18.263]  And we've asked, just out of curiosity, and people frequently just volunteer where they've got it, and many of them, the guns were a gift from a parent or a boyfriend concerned for their safety.
[00:15:18.463 --> 00:15:19.683]  And, you know, that's understandable.
[00:15:19.744 --> 00:15:25.727]  Okay, Pastor, look, I read your quotes here from ABC News.
[00:15:26.443 --> 00:15:27.204]  We're good to go.
[00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:53.525]  I've had the experience of having a family in my congregation lose a child from...
[00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:13.226]  A child playing with a pistol in a neighbor's house.
[00:16:13.246 --> 00:16:14.948]  Well, cars killed 12 times that number.
[00:16:15.268 --> 00:16:16.129]  Are we going to ban cars?
[00:16:16.169 --> 00:16:19.613]  I see the result of what that has done to that family.
[00:16:19.914 --> 00:16:24.359]  Well, that's because they didn't properly store the guns.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.983]  Don't you know there's instant access pistol safes that cost $75?
[00:16:32.586 --> 00:16:39.392]  Once again, we don't force anyone to turn in their handguns or their rifles, and we're pleased to make this opportunity available.
[00:16:39.672 --> 00:16:43.195]  Well, I think the families love their families.
[00:16:43.215 --> 00:16:47.078]  307 households that we feel very comfortable that now feel safer.
[00:16:48.285 --> 00:16:49.626]  That they don't have a pistol.
[00:16:49.986 --> 00:16:53.047]  The first person to turn in a weapon was a grandmother.
[00:16:53.208 --> 00:16:54.568]  The very first one that we had.
[00:16:54.588 --> 00:16:56.609]  It was the day before Mother's Day.
[00:16:56.669 --> 00:16:57.349]  She came in.
[00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.130]  She had a rifle and a pistol.
[00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:05.493]  And she told us that the next day she knew her grandson was going to come and visit her for Mother's Day.
[00:17:05.553 --> 00:17:08.675]  And she was glad that she didn't have that for him to find.
[00:17:08.795 --> 00:17:13.277]  Well, Pastor, back when this... I saved some of the boxes.
[00:17:14.517 --> 00:17:19.860]  Yes, most people don't know how to properly store a handgun or a rifle.
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.060]  Well, you need to teach them how.
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.481]  Let me just tell you something.
[00:17:22.521 --> 00:17:26.883]  We've had people turn in weapons in cardboard boxes.
[00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:28.944]  I saved one of the cardboard boxes.
[00:17:29.696 --> 00:17:31.437]  Okay, let me stop you, Pastor.
[00:17:31.497 --> 00:17:32.637]  Pastor, Pastor, Pastor.
[00:17:33.117 --> 00:17:33.698]  Say what?
[00:17:34.058 --> 00:17:36.779]  Go ahead and put him on hold.
[00:17:36.819 --> 00:17:38.520]  If he wants to hang up, that's fine.
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.421]  Look, this is all a bunch of anti-gun propaganda.
[00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:51.296]  I was taught how to use a gun at a very young age.
[00:17:51.356 --> 00:17:52.917]  That's where gun safety comes from.
[00:17:53.657 --> 00:18:00.180]  And if you love your family, you learn how to use a gun, and you protect your family, this is all part of the big gun control agenda.
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:10.024]  And for you to say that Christ didn't say, sell your cloak and buy a sword, you're telling me, Pastor, as a pastor, you don't know that.
[00:18:10.484 --> 00:18:11.324]  There was a mistake.
[00:18:11.364 --> 00:18:16.887]  We did not pass out roses, but we did pass out $50 cash, and there were 59...
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.102]  Weapons turned, and we're very pleased with that result.
[00:18:21.422 --> 00:18:22.623]  And I wish you well today.
[00:18:23.003 --> 00:18:23.804]  I think it's horrible.
[00:18:24.244 --> 00:18:25.324]  I think it's horrible, Pastor.
[00:18:25.945 --> 00:18:26.925]  There, he just hung up on us.
[00:18:27.386 --> 00:18:28.426]  That guy's not a pastor.
[00:18:28.807 --> 00:18:36.011]  You know, I've got my Bible here on the bookshelf next to me, and I've sat through a lot of Sunday school and enjoyed it, but I do not know the particular verse.
[00:18:36.071 --> 00:18:38.252]  I know 50 people can call in and give us the verse.
[00:18:39.313 --> 00:18:42.615]  In fact, will somebody please call in and give us the chapter and verse?
[00:18:45.877 --> 00:18:47.138]  Which gospel is it in?
[00:18:49.478 --> 00:18:50.078]  Luke 2236.
[00:18:50.238 --> 00:18:54.860]  Okay, I'm told we're getting a bunch of calls telling us Luke 2236.
[00:18:55.941 --> 00:18:58.242]  Will somebody call in and please read Luke 2236?
[00:18:59.342 --> 00:19:05.745]  Because I can't leave the microphone and go to the other wall and dig my Bible out and go to Luke 2236.
[00:19:06.025 --> 00:19:09.287]  I mean, that guy was a real serpent.
[00:19:10.547 --> 00:19:11.588]  And he wouldn't shut up.
[00:19:12.448 --> 00:19:13.128]  And you know what?
[00:19:13.209 --> 00:19:16.430]  I am angry because these gun buybacks are going on all over the country.
[00:19:18.111 --> 00:19:32.142]  I must have seen 50 different police department news articles about them where they have these gun buybacks and take the guns and melt them down and make an image of a gun tied in a knot with a barrel tied in a knot and put that out front of the church or put it out front of the police station.
[00:19:32.782 --> 00:19:39.627]  It's a culture of hating guns, which is the only thing right now holding back the New World Order from absolutely eating our lunch.
[00:19:41.369 --> 00:19:43.010]  I tell you, just ridiculous.
[00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:44.451]  And did you hear that?
[00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:45.932]  The Presbyterian Church
[00:19:46.898 --> 00:19:48.520]  Official policy is doing this.
[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.603]  Everybody should leave the Presbyterian Church.
[00:19:50.903 --> 00:19:54.067]  You should leave all these churches that are working for the New World Order.
[00:19:54.568 --> 00:19:57.992]  Baptist Church right here in Austin has UN gun buybacks.
[00:19:58.012 --> 00:19:58.773]  We'll be right back.

[00:21:01.911 --> 00:21:02.572]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:02.692 --> 00:21:12.617]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.

[00:22:00.416 --> 00:22:04.079]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:22:04.479 --> 00:22:09.903]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:22:10.364 --> 00:22:15.508]  It makes me wonder if the US citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:22:16.178 --> 00:22:29.490]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:22:29.991 --> 00:22:35.295]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:22:35.616 --> 00:22:41.501]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[00:24:07.256 --> 00:24:13.137]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:13.597 --> 00:24:16.317]  What does that liner we play mean?
[00:24:17.218 --> 00:24:17.678]  Don't worry.
[00:24:17.718 --> 00:24:18.698]  This show is documented.
[00:24:18.918 --> 00:24:20.578]  Because evil always fails.
[00:24:20.778 --> 00:24:21.618]  That's documented.
[00:24:21.658 --> 00:24:25.919]  Because our facts are documented and powerful.
[00:24:26.019 --> 00:24:28.380]  And we're winning the fight against the New World Order.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.740]  People are waking up everywhere.
[00:24:31.098 --> 00:24:38.044]  What an incredible statement by that so-called Presbyterian pastor in Dallas who's had a whole bunch of, well, seven different gun buybacks.
[00:24:39.505 --> 00:24:45.390]  What does it mean that he didn't know the verse where Christ said, sell your cloaks and buy swords?
[00:24:47.992 --> 00:24:48.853]  What does that mean?
[00:24:50.194 --> 00:24:56.820]  Well, it just shows that either the guy's a liar or he's completely ignorant of the most basic stuff in the Bible, in the New Testament.
[00:24:58.886 --> 00:24:59.406]  Incredible.
[00:24:59.426 --> 00:25:02.648]  And he wouldn't answer that question when I brought it back up to him for the second time.
[00:25:02.668 --> 00:25:03.508]  He just hung up on me.
[00:25:05.148 --> 00:25:06.769]  We've got a bunch of other news items coming up.
[00:25:06.809 --> 00:25:11.491]  Believe me, there's a lot of it and it's all important, but obviously everybody wants to talk about this now, so let's go to the calls.
[00:25:11.851 --> 00:25:19.814]  Frank in West Virginia says he's got his Bible open to the verse, chapter and verse, and he's going to read us the verse.
[00:25:19.854 --> 00:25:20.595]  Go ahead, Frank.
[00:25:21.075 --> 00:25:22.095]  Okay, Alex.
[00:25:22.535 --> 00:25:23.636]  Yes, you're correct, John.
[00:25:24.116 --> 00:25:26.237]  I'm sorry, Luke chapter 22 and verse 36 says,
[00:25:27.578 --> 00:25:33.719]  It says, "...then said he unto them, but now he that hath a purse..." Now, this is Jesus quoting, mind you.
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.940]  "...he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his script.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.861]  And he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one."
[00:25:40.921 --> 00:25:52.824]  Now, there's a follow-up verse to verses later, but the thing that came to my mind 15 years ago is why did Jesus tell his disciples to purchase, say, a sword?
[00:25:52.944 --> 00:25:56.745]  And if they don't have the money to buy the script, then to...
[00:25:57.395 --> 00:26:06.758]  Sell their cloak, sell their garment, something that was necessary, something that was certainly a necessity, for something that was more of a necessity.
[00:26:08.078 --> 00:26:17.480]  And the second verse after this, 37... Christ is saying, run around in a loincloth if you have to, because you're going to need weapons in the future.
[00:26:18.801 --> 00:26:23.202]  And exactly, right here in verse 37, next verse, For I say unto you,
[00:26:23.717 --> 00:26:26.037]  That this that is written must be accomplished in me.
[00:26:26.477 --> 00:26:30.158]  And he was reckoned among the transgressors, for the things concerning me have an end.
[00:26:31.058 --> 00:26:32.959]  This was the first advent.
[00:26:32.999 --> 00:26:35.459]  This is the first coming of Christ, not the second.
[00:26:35.519 --> 00:26:44.881]  Had it been the second, after Jesus would have defeated all the evil followers of Satan, certainly there would be peace on earth.
[00:26:44.941 --> 00:26:46.381]  But there would be no peace until then.
[00:26:47.301 --> 00:26:51.602]  And then he goes and says, actually one of the disciples said, Lord...
[00:26:52.509 --> 00:26:53.929]  Behold, here are two swords.
[00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.510]  And he said unto them, It is enough.
[00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:58.651]  So there was the MacCyron sword.
[00:26:58.931 --> 00:27:03.893]  There were two swords, a short sword for personal protection back then.
[00:27:04.273 --> 00:27:09.355]  There was also a longer sword used for combat in military service.
[00:27:09.715 --> 00:27:12.916]  So we're literally talking about the pistol and the rifle.
[00:27:14.116 --> 00:27:18.938]  Yes, in today's modern weaponry, I would have to agree with you 100%.
[00:27:20.949 --> 00:27:24.352]  The pistol and the rifle are the modern day swords of today.
[00:27:24.372 --> 00:27:29.796]  But the point here is, Frank, that we've got a so-called pastor on, and he told me that that wasn't true.
[00:27:30.157 --> 00:27:33.840]  He told me that wasn't in probably the most read part of the Bible.
[00:27:34.721 --> 00:27:37.403]  Yes, that doesn't surprise me.
[00:27:37.503 --> 00:27:40.045]  You think he was a liar, or do you think he's a complete idiot?
[00:27:41.286 --> 00:27:43.168]  You know, I've talked to a lot of pastors.
[00:27:43.268 --> 00:27:46.791]  I'm a preacher myself, and one thing that I've found is that people...
[00:27:48.032 --> 00:27:50.293]  Will not see what they don't want to see.
[00:27:50.333 --> 00:27:58.738]  If they're not open to the truth, they can read that passage a hundred times over, and it just doesn't seem to stand out to them because they don't have the Holy Spirit teaching them.
[00:27:59.218 --> 00:28:02.160]  If he isn't saved to start with, that's one problem.
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:02.880]  You know, I've noticed that.
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:11.465]  I can say something that's as clear as anything, and if people don't want to believe it, they'll just twist it around before they don't understand it.
[00:28:12.446 --> 00:28:13.006]  Exactly.
[00:28:13.366 --> 00:28:13.947]  Exactly.
[00:28:14.027 --> 00:28:16.328]  I've given people your videos, as a matter of fact,
[00:28:17.208 --> 00:28:18.608]  And sat down.
[00:28:19.008 --> 00:28:34.952]  I remember one guy sat down with, got to the part in 9-11, Road to Tyranny, and this guy was the FEMA, I believe, the FEMA commander who was talking about Christians and Founding Fathers being terrorists.
[00:28:35.292 --> 00:28:42.334]  This guy actually told me, he said, yeah, I can understand that, you know, I guess they would be back then, they'd be considered terrorists.
[00:28:42.354 --> 00:28:44.214]  This guy was identifying with the FEMA,
[00:28:44.795 --> 00:28:49.538]  Commander that was demonizing Christians and patriots.
[00:28:49.799 --> 00:28:54.082]  And then we have the training manual that says gun owners, defenders of the U.S.
[00:28:54.142 --> 00:28:57.904]  Constitution, we're all terrorists, homeschoolers.
[00:28:58.125 --> 00:29:00.967]  He even watched the homeschooler part and said, oh yeah, we're terrorists?
[00:29:01.887 --> 00:29:11.094]  Yeah, he could not, although he was a neocon, I'll have to say, and had been around conservatives all his life, he just didn't want to see it.
[00:29:11.778 --> 00:29:13.299]  He just couldn't want to see the truth, rather.
[00:29:13.319 --> 00:29:19.881]  But in the film, we have video in their own public documents where they say Christians, homeschoolers, gun owners were all terrorists.
[00:29:20.081 --> 00:29:22.001]  He watched that and agreed with it?
[00:29:22.421 --> 00:29:24.502]  He agreed with a lot of it.
[00:29:24.762 --> 00:29:27.323]  There's one more verse to find out.
[00:29:27.363 --> 00:29:28.063]  Here's a question.
[00:29:28.123 --> 00:29:29.704]  Who invented the first weapon?
[00:29:31.184 --> 00:29:34.945]  Now, ask that to the next preacher that says that he's having gun buybacks.
[00:29:34.965 --> 00:29:36.586]  Do you know who it was?
[00:29:36.766 --> 00:29:36.986]  Who?
[00:29:37.846 --> 00:29:38.667]  God Almighty.
[00:29:39.027 --> 00:29:39.507]  Genesis...
[00:29:40.214 --> 00:29:48.261]  In chapter 3, verse 24, that's when the cherubim, the high angel, had actually was guarding the garden.
[00:29:48.941 --> 00:29:50.443]  We got a break.
[00:29:51.203 --> 00:29:52.124]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.604 --> 00:29:54.206]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.127 --> 00:29:57.809]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.979 --> 00:30:07.221]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:30:07.361 --> 00:30:13.524]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:30:13.804 --> 00:30:22.227]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:29.490]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:34.633]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:30:34.853 --> 00:30:40.257]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:30:40.597 --> 00:30:43.679]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:51.945]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:30:52.025 --> 00:30:52.605]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:31:00.611 --> 00:31:02.152]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:31:02.312 --> 00:31:03.433]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:31:03.633 --> 00:31:07.035]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:31:07.135 --> 00:31:07.576]  Phenol?
[00:31:07.876 --> 00:31:15.001]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:31:15.301 --> 00:31:19.404]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:31:19.524 --> 00:31:19.965]  Fragrance?
[00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:25.108]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:31:25.249 --> 00:31:27.150]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache,
[00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:29.891]  Dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[00:31:30.132 --> 00:31:32.673]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[00:31:32.953 --> 00:31:36.355]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:31:36.515 --> 00:31:40.097]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:31:40.257 --> 00:31:42.658]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:31:42.778 --> 00:31:43.659]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:31:43.779 --> 00:31:53.524]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[00:31:55.725 --> 00:31:55.845]  3-4-0-7-0-9-1
[00:32:01.738 --> 00:32:04.339]  Brr, record cold spells gripping the nation this winter.
[00:32:04.459 --> 00:32:05.559]  So much for global warming.
[00:32:05.759 --> 00:32:09.920]  Of course, hand in hand with record cold spells usually go record fuel bills for heating.
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.920]  But for thousands of people across the country, there's no record fuel bill.
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.341]  In fact, there's no bill at all.
[00:32:14.521 --> 00:32:21.002]  These people have discovered the magic of a warm workshop without the cost by burning waste oil with a waste oil heater kit from Harold Electric.
[00:32:21.202 --> 00:32:23.823]  We all enjoy having a comfortable shop in the winter months to work in.
[00:32:24.043 --> 00:32:30.784]  And a waste oil heater from Harold Electric can turn your waste oil from a liability into an incredibly efficient and economical way to heat your workshop.
[00:32:31.024 --> 00:32:32.405]  The waste oil heater burns clean.
[00:32:32.605 --> 00:32:35.846]  So clean, in fact, that there's absolutely no visible smoke while it's running.
[00:32:35.966 --> 00:32:40.008]  There's no expensive maintenance, and the waste oil heaters from Harold Electric are easy to operate.
[00:32:40.168 --> 00:32:45.171]  With heating costs skyrocketing in the past couple of years, adding a waste oil heater in your shop makes perfect sense.
[00:32:45.391 --> 00:32:48.592]  And with a waste oil heater kit you build yourself from Harold Electric, it's easy.
[00:32:48.732 --> 00:32:51.214]  To learn more, visit wasteoilheater.net.
[00:32:51.334 --> 00:32:54.595]  That's www.wasteoilheater.net or call 1-800-541-8910.
[00:32:54.615 --> 00:32:56.376]  Call Harold Electric today and work in comfort tomorrow.
[00:33:02.678 --> 00:33:07.820]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.841]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:13.282 --> 00:33:15.063]  Alright, we're about to go back to the calls.
[00:33:15.163 --> 00:33:18.085]  Richard and Kelly and Davey and Paul and many others that are holding.
[00:33:18.125 --> 00:33:20.065]  Toll free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:20.085 --> 00:33:21.046]  For those that just joined us...
[00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:35.176]  About 15 minutes ago, I had this so-called pastor on the show, Bruce Buchanan, of the First Presbyterian Church in Dallas.
[00:33:35.976 --> 00:33:37.637]  That's a big church, by the way, folks.
[00:33:37.697 --> 00:33:38.478]  I'm from Dallas.
[00:33:40.039 --> 00:33:44.361]  And they've had seven gun buybacks and had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of guns turned in.
[00:33:44.381 --> 00:33:46.143]  They just had another one on Valentine's Day.
[00:33:46.163 --> 00:33:55.709]  And I mentioned Luke 22, 36, where Christ said, you know, if you don't have money, sell your cloak and buy a sword.
[00:33:57.712 --> 00:34:00.175]  And he said, no, that doesn't exist.
[00:34:00.275 --> 00:34:01.096]  I don't know about that.
[00:34:01.616 --> 00:34:06.601]  When that's one of the most famous, well-known verses out of the New Testament.
[00:34:08.283 --> 00:34:13.628]  But the point here is, is I have had listeners email me and send me news clippings, and I have seen...
[00:34:16.229 --> 00:34:25.496]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of news articles of churches, Baptist, Catholic, you name it, having gun buybacks.
[00:34:26.136 --> 00:34:34.062]  A listener sent me a news article a few years ago out of the Chicago Tribune where one of the big Catholic churches up in Chicago said you shouldn't own guns.
[00:34:34.122 --> 00:34:35.343]  Turn all your guns in.
[00:34:35.403 --> 00:34:38.225]  Guns should be banned.
[00:34:38.285 --> 00:34:42.408]  One of the big Baptist churches here in Austin, every October 24th on UN Day,
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:45.281]  We're good to go.
[00:34:45.321 --> 00:34:46.002]  We're good to go.
[00:35:05.217 --> 00:35:06.017]  Some bad news.
[00:35:06.177 --> 00:35:09.218]  I'm not saying Dean's good, but he's not the establishment candidate.
[00:35:09.638 --> 00:35:17.280]  New York Times says he's getting ready to drop out and to get behind John Forbes Carey, so we'll have a skull and bones candidacy.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:26.662]  A chilling article out of the New York Times with secret federal and local maneuvers for mass quarantines, forced inoculations, you name it.
[00:35:27.322 --> 00:35:28.142]  That's coming up.
[00:35:29.025 --> 00:35:31.046]  Bush says catastrophic attack possible.
[00:35:31.446 --> 00:35:32.547]  Brace for nuclear attack.
[00:35:32.587 --> 00:35:34.668]  Of course, we'll have to take all our rights after that happens.
[00:35:35.008 --> 00:35:37.789]  We're inches away from real, live martial law.
[00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:39.891]  And a lot more.
[00:35:39.951 --> 00:35:41.071]  It's all coming up.
[00:35:41.131 --> 00:35:44.813]  Some news on biometrics and the cashless society control grid.
[00:35:45.213 --> 00:35:49.595]  Before I go back to your calls, here in just a few minutes, then we've got Hutton Gibson in the third hour.
[00:35:49.615 --> 00:35:52.377]  A lot of key info.
[00:35:52.997 --> 00:35:54.598]  How these churches have been taken over.
[00:35:54.658 --> 00:35:56.959]  Before we do that, I've made ten films.
[00:35:57.039 --> 00:35:57.659]  I've written a book.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.500]  I've published a book.
[00:35:59.565 --> 00:36:01.246]  And this is how you support the show as well.
[00:36:02.446 --> 00:36:08.488]  We have hundreds of thousands of people every couple days watching the video clips on my website.
[00:36:08.608 --> 00:36:10.149]  That's millions monthly.
[00:36:11.509 --> 00:36:16.551]  And yes, I don't want to get into the amount of money I'm paying to do this, but I just bought another server.
[00:36:16.611 --> 00:36:17.592]  Bought one two weeks ago.
[00:36:17.632 --> 00:36:18.352]  That wasn't enough.
[00:36:18.692 --> 00:36:23.334]  Got the biggest, most fancy server that'll do 3,000 gigs a month.
[00:36:23.854 --> 00:36:25.555]  And if you don't know computers, just 3,000 gigs.
[00:36:27.597 --> 00:36:30.819]  That's so millions of you can go watch the videos.
[00:36:30.919 --> 00:36:32.339]  And I'm not a rich man.
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:38.882]  So help us, support us so we can... I mean, how can I turn this down?
[00:36:38.962 --> 00:36:45.065]  Millions of people, millions, millions want to come watch the videos we're posting.
[00:36:45.425 --> 00:36:46.006]  Millions!
[00:36:46.786 --> 00:36:47.947]  We're affecting change.
[00:36:48.007 --> 00:36:49.147]  We're reaching people.
[00:36:49.467 --> 00:36:50.668]  We're having an effect.
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:56.521]  I mean, national TV shows just have, you know, 5, 10 million viewers.
[00:36:57.021 --> 00:37:00.803]  Every month we have over 2 million people watching clips on the site.
[00:37:02.223 --> 00:37:03.143]  Think about that!
[00:37:03.543 --> 00:37:05.184]  So, yes, I'm bragging.
[00:37:05.204 --> 00:37:11.506]  I'm giving you the good news that God has blessed us, that we're reaching millions of people, and we're only one of many websites that are out there.
[00:37:12.651 --> 00:37:14.172]  But I've looked at the finances.
[00:37:14.212 --> 00:37:24.940]  I won't be able to continue this for a couple more months because I will not go into debt unless people can buy more videos, more books, more t-shirts, more bumper stickers, and support us.
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:27.401]  And when you get my videos, I tell you to make copies of them.
[00:37:27.441 --> 00:37:28.222]  Who else does that?
[00:37:29.261 --> 00:37:37.009]  Maybe one other person that I know of, Pastor Butch Pogg, a great man who makes some great documentaries and tells folks to make copies.
[00:37:37.369 --> 00:37:42.875]  That's because we're here to get the word out of Bev Harris, who exposes the electronic voting machine fraud.
[00:37:43.315 --> 00:37:46.319]  She decided to publish her book online for free.
[00:37:46.579 --> 00:37:48.841]  I mean, we're trying to save this country.
[00:37:49.582 --> 00:37:51.244]  Will you help us, please?
[00:37:52.653 --> 00:37:54.274]  I don't have millions of dollars, folks.
[00:37:55.314 --> 00:37:57.455]  I don't have the thousands of dollars to continue this.
[00:37:58.576 --> 00:37:59.816]  So please support us.
[00:37:59.896 --> 00:38:00.677]  Please help us.
[00:38:02.177 --> 00:38:05.058]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:38:05.098 --> 00:38:13.202]  Plus their great videos, 9-11 Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terrorism, both those films, Exposed Government Sponsored Terror in September 11th in Oklahoma City.
[00:38:14.389 --> 00:38:26.779]  Get my new film, Matrix of Evil, exposed, which goes through the globalist master plan and how to stop them, full of solutions with Ron Paul and Colonel Roberts, myself, Frank Morales, Cynthia McKinney.

[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:39.941]  They're $25.95 a piece.
[00:38:39.961 --> 00:38:43.022]  $20 when you order three or more of any of the ten videos.
[00:38:43.262 --> 00:38:44.082]  Those are my videos.
[00:38:44.122 --> 00:38:47.343]  I carry several other great videos by other authors, other books.
[00:38:48.063 --> 00:38:51.385]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:38:51.805 --> 00:38:52.385]  Don't wait.
[00:38:52.505 --> 00:38:53.245]  Go to the sites.
[00:38:53.285 --> 00:38:53.905]  Get the films.
[00:38:53.945 --> 00:38:54.506]  Get the books.
[00:38:54.546 --> 00:38:55.446]  Get them out to people.
[00:38:56.889 --> 00:38:58.329]  Again, here's the toll-free number.
[00:38:58.349 --> 00:38:58.809]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:38:58.829 --> 00:38:59.209]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:38:59.289 --> 00:39:05.111]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:39:24.384 --> 00:39:31.346]  And if you want to be a distributor of the books, the films, the books on tape, you can also contact our office and do that.
[00:39:31.366 --> 00:39:34.387]  1-888-253-3139 or 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:39:34.707 --> 00:39:40.909]  And one more side note, I'm here to promote people that are doing good works, that are fighting evil.
[00:39:49.855 --> 00:39:51.095]  That are effective.
[00:39:51.435 --> 00:40:10.379]  And if you go to Infowars.com, we now have a banner up there that links to the subsection of the Passion of Christ website, where Mel Gibson, for free, is giving out movie posters, flyers, stuff to promote the film, The Passion of Christ, that opens next week, the 25th of February, 2004.
[00:40:14.349 --> 00:40:20.574]  So go ahead and go there and order some of those free materials and promote that film as well and take your friends and family to see it opening day.
[00:40:21.035 --> 00:40:22.756]  You better go ahead and buy tickets online.
[00:40:22.856 --> 00:40:25.498]  Most cities have now sold out.
[00:40:25.618 --> 00:40:27.820]  Two weeks ago when I bought tickets, they were 60% sold.
[00:40:31.089 --> 00:40:36.172]  Better get to fandango.com or movies.com or all the websites that sell the tickets.
[00:40:36.192 --> 00:40:38.373]  Better get them now if you want to see it the first few days it's out.
[00:40:38.793 --> 00:40:43.636]  Okay, let's... Because that's what this show is about, supporting those that fight the New World Order.
[00:40:44.256 --> 00:40:46.477]  Let's talk to Richard in Indiana.
[00:40:46.877 --> 00:40:47.818]  Thanks for holding, Richard.
[00:40:47.858 --> 00:40:48.318]  Go ahead.
[00:40:49.238 --> 00:40:53.841]  Yeah, Alex, there's a scripture in Luke 11.21.
[00:40:54.661 --> 00:40:55.942]  When a strong man alms,
[00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:04.652]  Keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace.
[00:41:07.974 --> 00:41:09.115]  That's all I wanted to say.
[00:41:09.375 --> 00:41:10.916]  Well, it's common sense, Richard.
[00:41:11.276 --> 00:41:14.998]  If you love your family, you're supposed to be a man and know how to use a gun.
[00:41:15.038 --> 00:41:16.399]  You're supposed to train your children.
[00:41:16.419 --> 00:41:24.183]  And look, this sounds nuts to some people, but at four years of age, I was sitting in my father's lap
[00:41:25.131 --> 00:41:28.014]  Shooting Folgers coffee cans with a .410 shotgun.
[00:41:28.474 --> 00:41:33.339]  By the time I was eight years old, I could shoot a buck moving at 200 yards away.
[00:41:33.499 --> 00:41:36.242]  Today, I can shoot deer at 600 yards.
[00:41:37.744 --> 00:41:42.749]  Because my father trained me, and no one in our whole family's history has had an accident with a gun.
[00:41:43.917 --> 00:41:54.086]  And in the past, when we all owned guns, and the guns were on a gun case right out in full view, by the time a child could get up there to the guns, they knew not to touch them unless they were out shooting with their parents.
[00:41:54.526 --> 00:41:58.810]  So we didn't have all these accidents because people knew how to use guns, and we were a free country.
[00:41:58.850 --> 00:41:59.291]  Go ahead.
[00:42:00.111 --> 00:42:00.912]  Back in my day.
[00:42:01.993 --> 00:42:02.554]  Absolutely.
[00:42:04.575 --> 00:42:04.976]  I agree.
[00:42:05.216 --> 00:42:07.618]  What do you think of this preacher claiming he didn't know about Luke 22-36?
[00:42:07.638 --> 00:42:09.099]  Yeah, he should be ashamed.
[00:42:10.563 --> 00:42:11.504]  You think he's a liar?
[00:42:11.584 --> 00:42:13.125]  No, I don't think he's a liar.
[00:42:13.165 --> 00:42:15.306]  I just think he should be ashamed he doesn't study.
[00:42:17.528 --> 00:42:20.490]  Or he's just a con.
[00:42:22.612 --> 00:42:23.492]  Thanks for the call.
[00:42:23.733 --> 00:42:26.535]  Well, I just don't know how you can go to seminary and not know.
[00:42:27.035 --> 00:42:30.157]  But, you know, I've been told they don't even teach the Bible anymore at these seminaries.
[00:42:30.738 --> 00:42:33.380]  Whether it's Protestant or Catholic, no wonder we're in so much trouble.
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:35.221]  Disgusting!
[00:42:36.455 --> 00:42:37.816]  And look, I'm angry, folks.
[00:42:37.916 --> 00:42:39.398]  If they get our guns, it's all over.
[00:42:39.878 --> 00:42:41.479]  The guns are the insurance policy.
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:45.782]  I mean, I'm not turning my guns in like they did in Australia or England or Canada.
[00:42:45.802 --> 00:42:46.423]  I'm not doing it.
[00:42:47.364 --> 00:42:48.524]  That's my line in the sand.
[00:42:49.325 --> 00:42:50.826]  Let's talk to Kelly in Kentucky.
[00:42:50.846 --> 00:42:51.547]  Kelly, go ahead.
[00:42:52.387 --> 00:42:53.188]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:42:53.288 --> 00:42:53.528]  Good.
[00:42:53.548 --> 00:42:58.192]  I don't know if I'd be telling people to pass out these tapes.
[00:42:59.453 --> 00:43:04.877]  Police officers... Actually, I made a mistake and put it in his mailbox, and now they're trying to
[00:43:06.026 --> 00:43:07.227]  Prosecute me over it.
[00:43:08.887 --> 00:43:17.110]  Well, you know, we've had thousands of listeners make thousands of copies of the videos and give them to police and deliver them to firefighters, and usually they get a positive response.
[00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:24.873]  But you're telling me that you stuck it in the mailbox, and now they're trying to claim what, that it's a federal offense to stick something in a mailbox?
[00:43:25.393 --> 00:43:28.134]  Well, no, they didn't even charge me with that.
[00:43:28.914 --> 00:43:30.255]  Let me try to explain it to you.
[00:43:31.502 --> 00:43:34.764]  First, I had been going by this... He was a state trooper.
[00:43:35.084 --> 00:43:39.647]  I went by his house for probably about a month before I did this.
[00:43:40.388 --> 00:43:50.274]  And on my way to work every morning, I thought, well, it would be easy to try to inform him because I didn't think there was anything wrong with trying to inform people of authority in your area.
[00:43:51.395 --> 00:43:53.956]  So I put the tape in his mailbox, the first one.
[00:43:54.316 --> 00:43:57.679]  Well, evidently, he didn't know where it had come from or he didn't see me, right?
[00:43:58.559 --> 00:43:59.800]  So I went ahead and went to work.
[00:44:01.164 --> 00:44:11.908]  And then about two weeks later, I decided that I would put another one in his mailbox, another tape which confirmed your tape from other sources.
[00:44:12.889 --> 00:44:16.390]  Actually, it came off the History Channel and C-SPAN and stuff like that.
[00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:18.191]  Oh, you're a real radical.
[00:44:18.871 --> 00:44:20.472]  Well, yeah, I guess.
[00:44:21.232 --> 00:44:28.935]  But anyway, I put that one in his mailbox about two or three weeks later, and he saw me put it in there.
[00:44:28.955 --> 00:44:28.995]  So...
[00:44:31.328 --> 00:44:34.351]  I think it kind of hurt his pride or something.
[00:44:52.674 --> 00:44:59.876]  What did he do to you, this KGB officer that thinks that spreading information is un-American so he needs to go ahead and arrest you?
[00:44:59.916 --> 00:45:00.396]  What happened?
[00:45:00.676 --> 00:45:05.377]  Well, he pulled me over and came to my window and I said, how you doing?
[00:45:06.118 --> 00:45:08.998]  And he didn't say anything but get out of the truck.
[00:45:09.879 --> 00:45:10.159]  Right?
[00:45:10.539 --> 00:45:14.100]  So I got out of the truck and the second thing he said was turn around.
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.180]  And I asked him, I said, what am I being arrested for?
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.141]  Because he started putting the cuffs on me.
[00:45:19.858 --> 00:45:22.539]  He said, you're being arrested for terroristic threatening.
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:28.021]  So basically, I got locked up for terroristic threatening over your tape.
[00:45:28.901 --> 00:45:30.082]  And have they charged you?
[00:45:30.802 --> 00:45:32.082]  Yes, they have.
[00:45:32.122 --> 00:45:36.284]  They charged me with terroristic threatening and two counts of menacing.
[00:45:36.544 --> 00:45:40.846]  Okay, sir, Kelly, I need your phone number.
[00:45:41.106 --> 00:45:44.387]  I need to get you in contact with some First Amendment organizations.
[00:45:46.443 --> 00:45:47.564]  Number one, they're idiots.
[00:45:48.224 --> 00:45:54.686]  I know they've charged people that put the coupons in mailboxes because you're not supposed to put it in a mailbox, but that's not really enforced.
[00:45:54.986 --> 00:45:56.806]  They're so stupid they didn't charge you with that.
[00:45:56.846 --> 00:45:57.707]  That's the one thing they can do.
[00:45:57.727 --> 00:45:59.767]  I've told folks, don't put them in mailboxes.
[00:46:00.067 --> 00:46:01.088]  Just hand deliver them.
[00:46:01.828 --> 00:46:04.969]  But they have... Look, get a jury trial.
[00:46:05.509 --> 00:46:08.930]  Just go, my goodness, I just gave the guy a History Channel show and some stuff.
[00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:10.230]  I'm trying to inform people.
[00:46:10.991 --> 00:46:11.151]  And...
[00:46:14.276 --> 00:46:16.398]  They're going to try to make you plea bargain.
[00:46:17.078 --> 00:46:18.739]  I mean, this is horrible.
[00:46:18.759 --> 00:46:20.661]  There's one other case I know of this happening.
[00:46:21.461 --> 00:46:32.889]  A listener, and I actually got the news article on this, a listener in Florida every day was putting multiple copies on the windshields like people put flyers on my car every week.
[00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:40.755]  Usually a restaurant or a quick lube for one of those gas station ads.
[00:46:42.157 --> 00:46:46.779]  And they called the bomb squad out because it was a video.
[00:46:46.799 --> 00:46:47.780]  They thought it was a bomb.
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:48.700]  It wasn't a bomb.
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.321]  He heard it on the news.
[00:46:50.401 --> 00:46:52.942]  He called them and went in and said, I just gave you a video.
[00:46:53.002 --> 00:46:54.063]  Nothing happened to him.
[00:46:54.643 --> 00:46:56.284]  But in your case, this is insane.
[00:46:57.204 --> 00:46:58.885]  Now, let me stop you.
[00:46:59.185 --> 00:47:00.386]  I want you to go over what happened.
[00:47:00.406 --> 00:47:01.826]  He puts the cuffs on you.
[00:47:02.447 --> 00:47:03.187]  What happens next?
[00:47:03.247 --> 00:47:03.988]  What does he say to you?
[00:47:04.368 --> 00:47:11.051]  Then he threw me in the back of the car, and he basically took me to a...
[00:47:13.063 --> 00:47:23.730]  And what are they saying the threats are?
[00:47:25.151 --> 00:47:40.602]  Well, I told him that after he had already told me that I was being locked up for terroristic threatening, I was in the car and I told him, I said, well, you know, when a father sees something in the future that may be a threat to his children...
[00:47:41.363 --> 00:47:43.645]  Then he should take a course to try to protect them.
[00:47:44.006 --> 00:47:48.250]  Well, this jerk turned around and said that I had threatened his family and children.
[00:47:50.512 --> 00:47:52.154]  And he said because of the videos.
[00:47:53.575 --> 00:47:57.960]  No, no, he said because of... He's trying to twist this around and say that I...
[00:47:58.490 --> 00:48:00.712]  He said that I had threatened his children over that.
[00:48:01.072 --> 00:48:09.700]  Oh, see, they come around... Because I said, well, when a father sees something in the future that might be, you know, detrimental to their children, he has to take a course to try to protect them.
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:12.802]  Well, there's no way they can twist that, and they've got recorders in the car.
[00:48:13.663 --> 00:48:14.524]  Here's the thing, sir.
[00:48:16.056 --> 00:48:20.977]  Most state police wear a lapel microphone that's hooked into the recording system, so there should be audio of that.
[00:48:21.137 --> 00:48:21.857]  This is what they do.
[00:48:21.977 --> 00:48:22.537]  This is what they do.
[00:48:22.577 --> 00:48:28.539]  They arrest a patriot, then in the course they say you resist, or you threatened them, or you did something, then they try to charge you.
[00:48:29.199 --> 00:48:33.620]  Once you got to the jail, did you say to folks, so it's now illegal in America to give people videos?
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:39.001]  No, they didn't really let me talk to anyone.
[00:48:39.181 --> 00:48:44.962]  Basically, and let me tell you what happened after they released me from jail, okay?
[00:48:45.478 --> 00:48:59.449]  He, um, the jailer there, when I got ready to leave the jail there, he had me sign a statement, okay, saying that I wasn't to become within a thousand feet of this officer.
[00:48:59.909 --> 00:49:02.391]  Sir, you don't have to sign any statements in America.
[00:49:02.891 --> 00:49:03.071]  Right.
[00:49:03.091 --> 00:49:05.793]  Over and over again, they tell people to sign this, sign that.
[00:49:06.914 --> 00:49:10.397]  That was the only, that's the only way I could get out of here.
[00:49:10.417 --> 00:49:11.958]  Okay, what did the, yeah, that's what they tell you.
[00:49:11.998 --> 00:49:13.119]  What did the statement say, sir?
[00:49:14.399 --> 00:49:17.921]  It just said that I wasn't to come within a thousand feet of the officer.
[00:49:19.342 --> 00:49:22.043]  Did it say anything else, like I agree that I harassed him?
[00:49:22.123 --> 00:49:23.764]  Excuse me?
[00:49:24.204 --> 00:49:25.325]  Did it say anything else?
[00:49:26.545 --> 00:49:27.346]  No, just that.
[00:49:28.686 --> 00:49:33.468]  And then the judge would release me if I didn't contact him.
[00:49:33.609 --> 00:49:34.709]  When is your court date?
[00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:39.692]  My court date, the first court date is February the 23rd.
[00:49:40.492 --> 00:49:42.713]  And what is your lawyer saying?
[00:49:44.403 --> 00:49:53.847]  Well, he seems to think that there's some constitutional issue here that, you know, the First Amendment... But, I mean, you never... Okay, where are you?
[00:49:53.927 --> 00:49:54.748]  Where are you located?
[00:49:55.248 --> 00:49:56.949]  I'm located in Fredonia, Kentucky.
[00:49:57.509 --> 00:49:58.129]  Fredonia?
[00:49:58.149 --> 00:49:58.689]  Uh-huh.
[00:49:58.869 --> 00:49:59.530]  How do you spell that?
[00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:00.710]  It's a little town.
[00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:01.491]  How do you spell that?
[00:50:02.511 --> 00:50:04.952]  F-R-E-D-O-I-A.
[00:50:06.793 --> 00:50:07.373]  Kentucky.
[00:50:08.854 --> 00:50:11.855]  And what's the officer's name?
[00:50:12.615 --> 00:50:13.696]  It's an Officer Dobb.
[00:50:14.847 --> 00:50:15.748]  The old DD.
[00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:21.174]  And did you ever talk to the people at the jail and go, this is crazy, I gave the guy a video?
[00:50:23.156 --> 00:50:27.318]  No, I haven't seen... And then they'll come back with, well, you said you were wanting somebody to protect their children.
[00:50:27.338 --> 00:50:29.038]  Well, that's what everybody... That's a statement.
[00:50:29.098 --> 00:50:30.679]  Oh, you need to protect their children's future.
[00:50:30.699 --> 00:50:35.581]  I mean, look, they don't have... Look, they're going to try to make you plea bargain.
[00:50:35.601 --> 00:50:37.081]  They're going to go, this is how you get out of it.
[00:50:37.101 --> 00:50:38.161]  Just go on probation.
[00:50:38.401 --> 00:50:41.142]  And if you want to believe them and sign your rights, go ahead.
[00:50:41.643 --> 00:50:47.485]  But you need to get this thrown out, and you need to sue them for official oppression.
[00:50:48.105 --> 00:50:48.665]  I'll tell you what.
[00:50:49.574 --> 00:50:50.476]  Don't hang up, Kelly.
[00:50:50.516 --> 00:50:51.638]  I want your home phone number.
[00:50:51.799 --> 00:50:52.099]  Okay.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.544]  And I need to get you in touch with some people.
[00:50:55.226 --> 00:50:56.528]  This is insane.
[00:50:57.029 --> 00:50:58.172]  But it's what's in the video.
[00:50:58.192 --> 00:50:59.555]  I mean, what do you expect from these people?
[00:51:00.954 --> 00:51:04.437]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:51:04.697 --> 00:51:08.200]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[00:52:29.926 --> 00:52:40.393]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:52:40.693 --> 00:52:46.057]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:53:01.982 --> 00:53:05.823]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:53:06.143 --> 00:53:06.963]  Read the labels.
[00:53:07.404 --> 00:53:11.525]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:53:11.745 --> 00:53:15.926]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:53:16.306 --> 00:53:21.168]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:53:21.568 --> 00:53:25.112]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.

[00:53:49.155 --> 00:53:50.336]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:53:50.356 --> 00:53:51.457]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:12.783 --> 00:54:15.631]  I was just talking to Kelly during the break.
[00:54:16.193 --> 00:54:18.420]  This happened three, four weeks ago.
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:20.366]  He thought they'd drop it.
[00:54:21.027 --> 00:54:28.589]  Then he went before the judge for pre-trial, and the judge said, you're guilty of handing a police officer an anti-government, anti-police video.
[00:54:29.330 --> 00:54:32.951]  And so that is so important that he has witnesses to that.
[00:54:33.011 --> 00:54:38.653]  If his lawyer doesn't know that that is totally insane and has prejudiced the judge, then I don't know what does.
[00:54:38.693 --> 00:54:40.113]  You've got to have witnesses to that.
[00:54:40.633 --> 00:54:45.395]  You've got to get in touch with the different foundations that fight this type of stuff.
[00:54:45.735 --> 00:54:48.116]  You've got to get in touch with a local newspaper reporter.
[00:54:49.876 --> 00:54:52.277]  We need to give out your contact info for people.
[00:54:52.317 --> 00:54:53.738]  I need to write a report on this.
[00:54:54.138 --> 00:54:58.600]  I need you to fax me all the documents so I know this is a real story, though I believe you.
[00:55:00.141 --> 00:55:01.902]  This is so scary.
[00:55:02.422 --> 00:55:10.406]  And we're talking to Kelly Rushing, who gave a police officer some videos, including C-SPAN and Discovery or History Channel.
[00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:16.043]  And the judge said, you're guilty of giving a police officer an anti-government, anti-police video.
[00:55:16.463 --> 00:55:17.084]  Which isn't.
[00:55:17.184 --> 00:55:20.705]  I mean, my films I've made have aired on national TV.
[00:55:21.546 --> 00:55:24.307]  Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove on the Trio Network.
[00:55:25.187 --> 00:55:28.068]  So, I mean, this is a free country, but they don't think so.
[00:55:28.128 --> 00:55:29.009]  This is their mindset.
[00:55:29.029 --> 00:55:30.229]  This is what we show in the video.
[00:55:30.550 --> 00:55:31.430]  We're all terrorists.
[00:55:31.450 --> 00:55:32.811]  We're bad if we talk about freedom.
[00:55:33.211 --> 00:55:38.773]  Now, Alex, you know, after the judge told me that, I told him, I said, wait a minute.
[00:55:38.813 --> 00:55:40.674]  That was an anti-corruption tape.
[00:55:42.256 --> 00:55:43.017]  But wait a minute.
[00:55:43.537 --> 00:55:47.621]  You should have said to the judge, it doesn't matter what the video is, it's a free country.
[00:55:47.661 --> 00:55:53.905]  So how many, hold on, hold on, how many witnesses do you have to the judge saying that?
[00:55:55.006 --> 00:55:57.228]  Well, it was a pre-trial.
[00:55:58.028 --> 00:55:58.789]  How many witnesses?
[00:55:59.710 --> 00:56:03.533]  I don't know that there was any witnesses in there that was on my side.
[00:56:03.553 --> 00:56:06.575]  I mean, I went to the pre-trial.
[00:56:07.068 --> 00:56:10.269]  Not realizing that they were actually going to pursue this thing.
[00:56:10.349 --> 00:56:14.250]  But under oath, they may lie under oath, but was your lawyer there?
[00:56:15.010 --> 00:56:15.451]  No, sir.
[00:56:15.751 --> 00:56:17.051]  Was the court reporter typing?
[00:56:17.071 --> 00:56:17.291]  Huh?
[00:56:17.351 --> 00:56:18.872]  Was there a court reporter?
[00:56:24.421 --> 00:56:27.722]  As far as I know, I know the prosecuting attorney was there.
[00:56:27.742 --> 00:56:35.943]  You need to very quietly get a copy of that because that judge is in deep trouble saying you're guilty.
[00:56:36.003 --> 00:56:38.144]  A judge saying you are guilty at a pretrial.
[00:56:38.184 --> 00:56:42.605]  You are guilty, he's saying, and you're guilty of giving somebody a C-SPAN video.
[00:56:42.825 --> 00:56:43.865]  This is anti-government.
[00:56:46.786 --> 00:56:48.626]  This is a small town.
[00:56:48.686 --> 00:56:51.267]  Yeah, they're on power trips and they think they're God and they're not.
[00:56:51.687 --> 00:56:52.687]  What's the judge's name?
[00:56:53.952 --> 00:56:55.232]  I couldn't tell you, Alex.
[00:56:55.252 --> 00:56:57.753]  You need to find all this out, and I need to have you on as a guest.
[00:56:58.013 --> 00:56:59.773]  Can you fax me everything you've got?
[00:57:00.233 --> 00:57:01.194]  Okay, okay.
[00:57:01.794 --> 00:57:03.194]  Okay, let me give you my fax number.
[00:57:03.754 --> 00:57:04.114]  Okay.
[00:57:04.414 --> 00:57:06.495]  And folks, don't send me 20 pages of fax.
[00:57:06.835 --> 00:57:08.135]  Listeners do this all the time.
[00:57:08.195 --> 00:57:11.976]  I give it out, and people send me books, you know, 100-page faxes, you name it.
[00:57:12.476 --> 00:57:12.696]  Yeah.
[00:57:13.036 --> 00:57:15.296]  Folks, if you do that, send me... Hold on just a second.
[00:57:15.616 --> 00:57:17.537]  Folks, if you do that, send me 20 bucks for a...
[00:57:19.566 --> 00:57:21.867]  A cartridge for the fax machine.
[00:57:22.187 --> 00:57:24.147]  Sir, I need you to fax me all this immediately.
[00:57:24.187 --> 00:57:25.327]  I'll write a news story about it.
[00:57:25.347 --> 00:57:26.328]  I'll have you on as a guest.
[00:57:26.688 --> 00:57:27.828]  And I'll put some energy into this.
[00:57:27.848 --> 00:57:29.028]  But if you don't, I can't help you.
[00:57:29.248 --> 00:57:30.428]  Are you ready for my fax number?
[00:57:30.829 --> 00:57:31.209]  Uh, yeah.
[00:57:31.629 --> 00:57:33.749]  It's 512... 512... 899... Okay, hang on a second.
[00:57:33.769 --> 00:57:33.749]  899... 9809.
[00:57:33.949 --> 00:57:34.449]  9809.
[00:57:33.969 --> 00:57:34.449]  Okay, that's...
[00:57:46.957 --> 00:57:47.198]  That's 512-899-9809.
[00:57:54.175 --> 00:57:55.076]  Well, man, okay.
[00:57:55.276 --> 00:57:55.976]  Yes, sir.
[00:57:56.316 --> 00:57:59.178]  And Kelly Rushing, you need to get me proof of this.
[00:57:59.618 --> 00:58:02.160]  This is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard him do.
[00:58:03.261 --> 00:58:04.381]  But it's in the video.
[00:58:04.421 --> 00:58:05.802]  That's what they say we are.
[00:58:06.263 --> 00:58:07.804]  You know, talking is bad.
[00:58:07.864 --> 00:58:08.624]  The First Amendment.
[00:58:09.024 --> 00:58:12.406]  Michael Savage says put us in camps and we disagree with the government.
[00:58:12.447 --> 00:58:15.088]  I mean, this is... I think we're all enemy combatants, ain't we?
[00:58:15.468 --> 00:58:17.730]  So what did you say to the judge when he said this?
[00:58:20.071 --> 00:58:22.573]  Well, I told him that it was anti-corruption...
[00:58:23.192 --> 00:58:26.614]  And he says, well, you're rather outspoken, aren't you?
[00:58:26.974 --> 00:58:27.394]  Oh!
[00:58:27.635 --> 00:58:29.296]  So he said that was bad.
[00:58:29.316 --> 00:58:33.678]  I was thinking to myself, well, thank God for men that were outspoken.
[00:58:33.718 --> 00:58:37.380]  You wouldn't be sitting there enjoying the freedoms you've enjoyed all your life, sucker.
[00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:43.624]  And by the way, you also mentioned that you're facing a year in jail.
[00:58:44.424 --> 00:58:45.785]  Yeah, yeah, that's what he told me.
[00:58:46.545 --> 00:58:48.826]  Isn't that, stay there, and more calls are coming up.
[00:58:48.886 --> 00:58:49.607]  I'm about to vomit.
[00:58:52.591 --> 00:58:57.095]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:58:57.455 --> 00:59:01.539]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:59:01.819 --> 00:59:02.380]  We listened.
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:07.684]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:59:07.945 --> 00:59:08.425]  We listened.
[00:59:08.825 --> 00:59:11.848]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:59:12.288 --> 00:59:12.809]  We listened.
[00:59:13.269 --> 00:59:13.930]  We're good to go.
[00:59:42.824 --> 00:59:43.484]  Big Brother.
[00:59:43.504 --> 00:59:43.885]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:43.905 --> 00:59:44.605]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:44.645 --> 00:59:45.686]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.193 --> 01:00:05.094]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.114 --> 01:00:09.396]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.937 --> 01:00:14.059]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:16.921]  All right, my friends.
[01:00:17.161 --> 01:00:20.904]  We've got Hutton Gibson, expert on the New World Order.
[01:00:21.204 --> 01:00:27.288]  We'll talk about how they've taken over the churches in America and worldwide in this next hour.
[01:00:28.331 --> 01:00:30.412]  Got a bunch of news we're going to get to in loaded phones.
[01:00:30.813 --> 01:00:33.074]  Davey and Paul and many others that are holding.
[01:00:33.634 --> 01:00:35.155]  Unexpected turn of events.
[01:00:37.397 --> 01:00:39.098]  This is the first case of this I've heard of.
[01:00:39.158 --> 01:00:51.125]  A listener in Kentucky, Kelly Rushing, who I believe, but I have to get all the documents on this, put in a police officer's mailbox one of my videos, a C-SPAN video,
[01:00:53.012 --> 01:00:54.193]  Exposing the New World Order.
[01:00:54.293 --> 01:00:57.675]  And so the cop waited for him, pulled him over, said, you threatened my family.
[01:00:58.376 --> 01:00:59.937]  And he didn't take it serious.
[01:01:00.757 --> 01:01:09.484]  Kelly couldn't imagine he'd done something wrong until the judge said, you're guilty of giving a police officer an anti-government, anti-police video.
[01:01:10.164 --> 01:01:11.345]  So now that's a crime.
[01:01:12.165 --> 01:01:13.626]  You've got to get the court record of that.
[01:01:13.667 --> 01:01:17.269]  You've got to get the squad car audio, which he'll probably claim disappeared.
[01:01:18.070 --> 01:01:19.951]  But then if a jury hears all that,
[01:01:21.277 --> 01:01:22.258]  This is the new America.
[01:01:22.298 --> 01:01:25.399]  These people will sleep just fine seeing you go to jail.
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:30.321]  You said the judge said one year in jail for threatening a police officer.
[01:01:31.382 --> 01:01:35.584]  And, of course, after they get you in the car, then he claims that you threatened his family, which you say you didn't do.
[01:01:35.644 --> 01:01:40.106]  You said, well, I think somebody would want to know about what's happening in this country to protect their children.
[01:01:40.126 --> 01:01:42.207]  And that's what we all say for your children's future.
[01:01:42.807 --> 01:01:44.328]  This is the Gestapo system.
[01:01:46.034 --> 01:01:50.015]  And you say that coming up the 23rd, next week, you're back in court, sir.
[01:01:50.336 --> 01:01:50.896]  Yes, I am.
[01:01:51.076 --> 01:01:51.516]  Yes, I am.
[01:01:51.716 --> 01:01:52.916]  And what does your lawyer say?
[01:01:53.096 --> 01:01:56.057]  Now, do you know your lawyer personally?
[01:01:56.077 --> 01:01:59.578]  Because a lot of times you can't get a lawyer there locally that will really represent you.
[01:02:00.098 --> 01:02:01.719]  No, sir, I don't know him personally.
[01:02:02.439 --> 01:02:08.141]  I have some people that told me that every time they've used him that they've won their case.
[01:02:08.481 --> 01:02:08.961]  Okay, good.
[01:02:09.301 --> 01:02:10.961]  And he's in Fredonia, Kentucky.
[01:02:11.542 --> 01:02:13.162]  Well, my lawyer's in Princeton.
[01:02:14.223 --> 01:02:15.344]  I live in Fredonia.
[01:02:15.645 --> 01:02:17.546]  Fredonia is a really small town.
[01:02:17.706 --> 01:02:22.350]  Okay, and what type of judge is this that's going after you?
[01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:23.611]  What type of judge?
[01:02:24.152 --> 01:02:26.474]  Yeah, I mean, is he a county judge?
[01:02:28.115 --> 01:02:29.296]  I really couldn't tell you, Alex.
[01:02:29.456 --> 01:02:31.578]  You need to find all that out and get it to me today.
[01:02:32.338 --> 01:02:32.659]  Today.
[01:02:32.679 --> 01:02:36.081]  And if I find out what you're saying is true and I can already... I believe you.
[01:02:36.142 --> 01:02:36.842]  This is standard.
[01:02:36.882 --> 01:02:39.004]  Well, I'm, you know, I'm kind of just a...
[01:02:39.454 --> 01:02:42.255]  Basic, simple old country boy, but I believe in right and wrong.
[01:02:43.055 --> 01:02:50.278]  Now, you said during the break that, to me, off air, that this is what the video says they do, and so, wow, they're really doing it.
[01:02:50.658 --> 01:02:53.039]  Oh, yeah, he acted out just like the video said he would.
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.440]  Well, this is America.
[01:02:56.481 --> 01:02:58.161]  You have a police officer video.
[01:02:58.361 --> 01:03:00.662]  Yeah, well, it confirmed things, you know, to me.
[01:03:01.222 --> 01:03:08.085]  And, of course, 1 Thessalonians 5.21 says to prove all things and hold fast to those that are good.
[01:03:08.809 --> 01:03:10.991]  Of course, you know, how do you do that?
[01:03:11.071 --> 01:03:13.833]  Sometimes it takes a hand-on approach to do that.
[01:03:14.554 --> 01:03:17.556]  Well, I'll tell you right now, you're going to be blessed after all this happens.
[01:03:17.736 --> 01:03:19.118]  So that's how it works.
[01:03:19.158 --> 01:03:21.980]  Every time I've been persecuted, I'm rewarded afterwards.
[01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:26.684]  But I don't want to end up in a job situation where, okay, well, we'll see what happens if you're not blessed.
[01:03:26.744 --> 01:03:30.287]  But I am so outraged, my friend.
[01:03:31.388 --> 01:03:32.789]  Do you want, well...
[01:03:34.096 --> 01:03:34.176]  Yeah.
[01:03:34.196 --> 01:03:34.316]  Yeah.
[01:03:34.396 --> 01:03:34.476]  Yeah.
[01:03:54.875 --> 01:03:55.835]  This is what's going to happen.
[01:03:56.176 --> 01:03:59.317]  You said when you left the jail, they said you can't leave until you sign this piece of paper.
[01:03:59.637 --> 01:04:00.857]  That's official repression.
[01:04:01.218 --> 01:04:02.518]  Hundreds of court cases on that.
[01:04:02.578 --> 01:04:03.439]  That's very corrupt.
[01:04:03.919 --> 01:04:05.039]  Yeah.
[01:04:05.079 --> 01:04:05.619]  Sign this thing.
[01:04:05.639 --> 01:04:10.721]  It won't come within 1,000 yards of this police officer, this state police officer.
[01:04:11.682 --> 01:04:16.784]  The next thing you need to do is get the audio off the squad car audio, which they have.
[01:04:17.184 --> 01:04:19.445]  Yeah, well, I put in a motion of discovery.
[01:04:20.257 --> 01:04:22.959]  Right there in pre-trial after I pled not guilty.
[01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:24.741]  And the judge says you're guilty.
[01:04:25.902 --> 01:04:27.903]  Now, again, that disqualifies the judge right there.
[01:04:27.943 --> 01:04:29.525]  The judge said you're guilty.
[01:04:29.785 --> 01:04:34.048]  You're guilty of giving a police officer an anti-government, anti-police video.
[01:04:34.088 --> 01:04:34.749]  That's your crime.
[01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:35.529]  The judge said it.
[01:04:36.010 --> 01:04:37.151]  And now they're going after you.
[01:04:37.951 --> 01:04:41.554]  And you need to... Oh, boy.
[01:04:41.614 --> 01:04:42.075]  I'll tell you what.
[01:04:42.475 --> 01:04:43.536]  Get me all the info.
[01:04:43.576 --> 01:04:44.597]  You have my fax number.
[01:04:44.697 --> 01:04:45.797]  I need that today.
[01:04:46.058 --> 01:04:46.418]  Okay.
[01:04:46.618 --> 01:04:47.419]  I'll do it, Alex.
[01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:49.685]  We'll get you on as a guest later this week.
[01:04:49.725 --> 01:04:50.306]  We'll be back.
[01:04:50.506 --> 01:04:56.170]  I'm just... We've all heard the ads for lower prices on airfare and hotel.
[01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:58.172]  Oh yeah, the dot-coms are endless.

[01:06:52.176 --> 01:06:56.519]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:06:56.719 --> 01:07:01.062]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:07:03.865 --> 01:07:05.646]  Disaster is a new world order.
[01:07:05.746 --> 01:07:08.548]  A new world order can emerge.
[01:07:08.808 --> 01:07:13.031]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:07:13.111 --> 01:07:20.036]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:07:20.176 --> 01:07:22.178]  You will lose your liberty.

[01:07:59.151 --> 01:08:00.191]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:00.912 --> 01:08:02.032]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:02.692 --> 01:08:03.493]  You want answers?
[01:08:04.253 --> 01:08:05.154]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:05.174 --> 01:08:09.516]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.996 --> 01:08:14.118]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:20.322]  If you go into the Travis County...
[01:08:22.575 --> 01:08:32.178]  SWAT team office on the top floor of the Sheriff's Department off 11th Street in downtown Austin, as I have done when Delta Force was in Austin a few years ago.
[01:08:32.238 --> 01:08:32.858]  I was down there.
[01:08:34.118 --> 01:08:37.559]  You will see, at the time, four or five of my videos on the shelf.
[01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:41.881]  And they know about the New World Order.
[01:08:44.141 --> 01:08:49.703]  You also saw the Oklahoma City bombing video there, so they obviously have watched that and know who really carried that out.
[01:08:52.651 --> 01:09:01.216]  And all over the country, thousands and thousands of listeners have gotten the videos and made thousands of copies, in many cases, dozens in other cases, and gotten them out to people.
[01:09:01.256 --> 01:09:02.937]  They've aired on national television.
[01:09:02.957 --> 01:09:07.020]  They've been put on access TV stations around the country.
[01:09:08.801 --> 01:09:18.747]  And a listener gives a cop, a state police officer in Kentucky, some of my videos, including a video of some C-SPAN and History Channel stuff, and he's arrested, and they say it's a threat.
[01:09:19.227 --> 01:09:21.569]  He pulls him out of the car, says, you threatened my family.
[01:09:22.185 --> 01:09:23.086]  The guy says, what do you mean?
[01:09:23.126 --> 01:09:24.207]  I gave you some videos.
[01:09:25.508 --> 01:09:28.190]  And the guy says, you threatened my family, and now he's being charged.
[01:09:28.230 --> 01:09:38.177]  And the judge says, in Fredonia, Kentucky, that, hey, boy, you're guilty of giving a police officer an anti-government, anti-police video.
[01:09:38.297 --> 01:09:39.899]  And then they go ahead with charging him.
[01:09:40.499 --> 01:09:41.900]  And don't think he won't go to jail.
[01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:45.923]  Now, most police aren't like this, but in a lot of areas they are.
[01:09:46.604 --> 01:09:48.085]  Certainly they've been under federal training.
[01:09:48.565 --> 01:09:51.828]  That's what the caller before, the last caller was talking about.
[01:09:56.864 --> 01:09:59.185]  And whoever we've got on hold, we'll go ahead and put them on hold.
[01:09:59.505 --> 01:10:03.026]  We've concluded our discussion with Kelly Rushing.
[01:10:03.066 --> 01:10:05.446]  We're going to be getting him on as a guest in the future.
[01:10:06.527 --> 01:10:07.807]  Is everything okay, Stephanie?
[01:10:10.028 --> 01:10:11.728]  I just heard a caller or something in the background.
[01:10:13.068 --> 01:10:14.709]  I mean, that's... See?
[01:10:16.049 --> 01:10:17.209]  Yeah.
[01:10:17.269 --> 01:10:17.549]  Yes, sir.
[01:10:17.570 --> 01:10:18.570]  We're going to get you back on.
[01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:19.450]  I'm sorry.
[01:10:19.930 --> 01:10:21.371]  She thought I was still having you on the show.
[01:10:22.831 --> 01:10:23.051]  Again...
[01:10:24.235 --> 01:10:27.136]  That kind of broke my train of thought, but let me go back to what I was saying.
[01:10:28.377 --> 01:10:31.198]  In my film, Road to Tyranny, we have FEMA.
[01:10:31.258 --> 01:10:32.118]  We have police.
[01:10:32.638 --> 01:10:35.599]  We have them being taught that all Christians are terrorists.
[01:10:35.639 --> 01:10:36.920]  The Founding Fathers are bad.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.440]  Anybody that talks about them is bad.
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.561]  But homeschoolers are terrorists.
[01:10:40.921 --> 01:10:44.002]  We have their own documents, their own video, their own training flyers.
[01:10:44.422 --> 01:10:45.163]  We have it all.
[01:10:46.463 --> 01:10:49.024]  And then you go out on the road, well, it's like Abby Newman.
[01:10:50.344 --> 01:10:51.925]  She's at a checkpoint, pulls up,
[01:10:52.794 --> 01:10:54.715]  Behind the other cars, they're in front of her.
[01:10:55.755 --> 01:10:56.975]  They say, we want to search your car.
[01:10:57.015 --> 01:10:58.796]  She says, no, you can't do that without a warrant.
[01:10:58.816 --> 01:10:59.336]  Fourth Amendment.
[01:10:59.376 --> 01:11:00.417]  They jerk her out of the car.
[01:11:00.457 --> 01:11:01.257]  She doesn't resist.
[01:11:01.297 --> 01:11:02.477]  They charge her with resisting.
[01:11:03.278 --> 01:11:09.780]  And then on their own audio, because they have microphones on their uniform, on their ties, they go, my goodness.
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.421]  You know, she's got a pocket constitution.
[01:11:12.461 --> 01:11:15.182]  She's got information about Social Security.
[01:11:15.222 --> 01:11:17.642]  She's got a, well, she even had a video.
[01:11:17.682 --> 01:11:19.103]  She hadn't taken back to the store.
[01:11:21.011 --> 01:11:24.993]  With that really evil right-winger, Harrison Ford, Patriot Games.
[01:11:25.093 --> 01:11:27.854]  And in there was also my video, Police State 2000.
[01:11:29.015 --> 01:11:30.196]  That upset them greatly.
[01:11:32.157 --> 01:11:34.158]  And, you know, an award-winning film.
[01:11:36.039 --> 01:11:38.820]  And so they discuss it and say, is this illegal?
[01:11:38.881 --> 01:11:40.141]  Is she allowed to have this?
[01:11:40.902 --> 01:11:41.942]  It's all on video!
[01:11:43.203 --> 01:11:46.385]  So see, in America now, they think videos are illegal.
[01:11:46.425 --> 01:11:46.765]  They think...
[01:11:47.412 --> 01:11:49.993]  They think giving a cop a C-SPAN video is illegal.
[01:11:50.033 --> 01:11:51.914]  They think just talking to them are illegal.
[01:11:53.415 --> 01:11:55.516]  And they'll feel good putting you under the jail.
[01:11:56.376 --> 01:11:58.717]  They'll feel good taking your life and ruining it.
[01:11:58.957 --> 01:12:01.218]  Because they're God now in this country.
[01:12:01.498 --> 01:12:03.639]  We're living in the new Soviet Union of America.
[01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:07.781]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:12:10.462 --> 01:12:10.582]  And...
[01:12:13.397 --> 01:12:14.878]  They're harassing homeschoolers.
[01:12:14.938 --> 01:12:19.162]  They act like if you're a homeschooler, when CPS comes out, you automatically are some type of criminal.
[01:12:20.143 --> 01:12:22.204]  Gun shops are being shut down, harassed.
[01:12:22.404 --> 01:12:24.986]  Anything decent, anything America.
[01:12:25.207 --> 01:12:26.247]  And I'm sick of it!
[01:12:28.289 --> 01:12:30.831]  So, Kelly Rushing, we're going to get to the bottom of this.
[01:12:30.871 --> 01:12:33.633]  Send me your documents, and I'm going to write a news article about this.
[01:12:34.214 --> 01:12:35.715]  I'm going to get this out to everybody.
[01:12:36.055 --> 01:12:36.596]  Everybody.
[01:12:38.557 --> 01:12:41.640]  And I'm going to... I am so sick of this type of garbage.
[01:12:42.717 --> 01:12:44.402]  I've got to calm down, folks.
[01:12:45.044 --> 01:12:46.508]  To see America turned into this.
[01:12:47.495 --> 01:12:48.995]  Let's talk to Davey in Texas.
[01:12:49.035 --> 01:12:49.815]  Davey, go ahead.
[01:12:50.116 --> 01:12:51.136]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:12:51.616 --> 01:12:56.057]  I've got a couple of verses here from Isaiah chapter 59, verse 14 and 15.
[01:12:56.797 --> 01:13:13.160]  Okay, for those that just joined us and missed the preacher in the last hour who had a gun buyback at the First Presbyterian Church, according to ABC News, when I read the verse on air, or had a listener do it, Luke 22, 36, where Christ said, "...sell your cloaks and buy swords," he said that didn't exist.
[01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:16.280]  And so now you're obviously calling in about that.
[01:13:16.641 --> 01:13:21.841]  Well, that and the issue in Kentucky there, and it's fundamentally an issue of good faith.
[01:13:22.382 --> 01:13:29.323]  As you pointed out in your videos, these mind control robots, they call themselves the police, which are policy enforcers.
[01:13:29.703 --> 01:13:31.263]  They have no knowledge of truth.
[01:13:31.783 --> 01:13:41.765]  And when somebody shows them the truth, they feel threatened because their programmers didn't tell them what to do when the truth comes up and stares them in the face and they feel afraid.
[01:13:42.250 --> 01:13:44.431]  That's where fear comes from, is ignorance.
[01:13:45.251 --> 01:13:50.212]  And the issue, Alex, is fundamentally one of good faith.
[01:13:50.272 --> 01:13:54.533]  And that minister over in Dallas is not a good faith individual.
[01:13:54.573 --> 01:13:56.734]  He's not telling the truth of the gospel.
[01:13:57.134 --> 01:14:03.616]  He's putting forward an agenda just like the police officers in this country that listen to the programmers.
[01:14:04.759 --> 01:14:09.201]  I was going to tell you about last week in Dallas, they had the police chiefs meeting.
[01:14:09.221 --> 01:14:10.142]  Did you hear about that?
[01:14:10.442 --> 01:14:10.922]  No, I didn't.
[01:14:11.222 --> 01:14:24.628]  Oh, yeah, they brought in police chiefs from all over the country, the 50 largest cities in America to program them, and we found out that, of course, they just returned from an ADL-sponsored trip to Israel.
[01:14:24.648 --> 01:14:32.172]  By the way, I was sent a big law enforcement magazine last year where it said, and I ought to dig that out,
[01:14:33.468 --> 01:14:37.332]  Where it's said, where it's said, if somebody's got to get us out of the U.N.
[01:14:37.672 --> 01:14:41.075]  sticker, they're probably a criminal, go ahead and arrest them.
[01:14:41.135 --> 01:14:45.038]  Now, that is in a major law enforcement technology.
[01:14:45.258 --> 01:14:47.861]  Right, and the issue is one of good faith.
[01:14:47.881 --> 01:14:50.002]  Arrest us for a bumper sticker!
[01:14:50.123 --> 01:14:50.423]  Yeah.
[01:14:50.979 --> 01:14:52.060]  Project Megiddo.
[01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:55.603]  The only threat to them are people that know what the truth is.
[01:14:55.683 --> 01:14:56.684]  That's the issue here.
[01:14:56.724 --> 01:15:05.092]  We're already living in the Soviet Union, and if they could move against us en masse, they would have already done it, but some of their cops aren't programmed.
[01:15:05.112 --> 01:15:06.173]  That's what's holding them back.
[01:15:06.733 --> 01:15:07.274]  Right, Alex.
[01:15:07.354 --> 01:15:11.638]  Also, there are these signs on the side of the road about guns cause crime, 1-800-ATF-GUNS.
[01:15:13.857 --> 01:15:16.100]  I don't know if you've seen them yet or not.
[01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:19.303]  Also, they're using the new FEMA billboards that were supposedly for traffic.
[01:15:19.343 --> 01:15:25.290]  It'll say report illegal guns, and they have the BATF thing that shows a handgun, and it says call the police.
[01:15:25.330 --> 01:15:28.694]  Well, handguns aren't illegal in Texas, but you're idiot.
[01:15:28.974 --> 01:15:29.915]  Listen, listen to me.
[01:15:29.955 --> 01:15:30.856]  I'm getting really mad now.
[01:15:31.116 --> 01:15:33.199]  About three years ago, I had a carpet cleaner.
[01:15:34.802 --> 01:15:38.664]  At my office, cleaning the carpets in my studio, and I've got a shotgun.
[01:15:38.824 --> 01:15:40.546]  I bought it at a local sporting goods store.
[01:15:40.886 --> 01:15:43.188]  Just a mainstream, no big deal shotgun.
[01:15:43.888 --> 01:15:45.109]  It's on the wall.
[01:15:45.349 --> 01:15:47.651]  He began to freak out, asking if that was legal.
[01:15:48.131 --> 01:15:50.733]  And then I was smart enough to call down that afternoon.
[01:15:51.634 --> 01:15:56.678]  Well, yes, there was a discussion of calling the police on you, but the owner knows that guns aren't illegal.
[01:15:56.878 --> 01:15:58.299]  These idiots thought...
[01:15:58.499 --> 01:16:01.862]  That my shotgun in Texas was illegal!
[01:16:02.002 --> 01:16:03.863]  And that's what those signs are meant to do.
[01:16:04.163 --> 01:16:05.024]  Exactly right.
[01:16:05.104 --> 01:16:07.086]  And the issue is, again, one of good faith.
[01:16:07.466 --> 01:16:13.170]  This is all coming out of the ATF Department of Justice Project Safe Neighborhood.
[01:16:13.451 --> 01:16:19.695]  You can do a Google search, Project Safe Neighborhood, Police Chief, ADL, and find out about that.
[01:16:19.715 --> 01:16:28.202]  But I would like to quote this, Isaiah 59, 14, and 15, and it says, And judgment is turned away backward, and justice...
[01:16:28.632 --> 01:16:33.756]  Standeth afar off, for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.
[01:16:34.136 --> 01:16:38.580]  Yea, truth faileth, and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey.
[01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:40.721]  That's Mr. Rushing in Kentucky.
[01:16:41.121 --> 01:16:44.764]  And the Almighty saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment.
[01:16:45.164 --> 01:16:50.328]  Incidentally, Alex, the media bypass is not far away from where he's located there.
[01:16:50.929 --> 01:16:52.890]  And keep up the good work, man.
[01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:53.711]  You're doing a great job.
[01:16:54.799 --> 01:16:55.339]  Absolutely.
[01:16:55.379 --> 01:16:56.479]  What an incredible quote.
[01:16:56.579 --> 01:16:57.259]  Absolutely.
[01:16:57.319 --> 01:16:59.440]  That those that tell the truth become prey.
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:03.080]  Look at Mel Gibson trying to make a movie about Jesus getting attacked.
[01:17:03.381 --> 01:17:05.661]  Look at how upside down things have gotten.
[01:17:05.921 --> 01:17:08.501]  There's naked people running around at the Super Bowl.
[01:17:09.222 --> 01:17:10.882]  The Boy Scouts are being taken over.
[01:17:11.042 --> 01:17:12.102]  All this is happening.
[01:17:16.123 --> 01:17:16.963]  Boy, I tell you.
[01:17:17.183 --> 01:17:18.763]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:17:19.523 --> 01:17:20.884]  Let's talk to Paula in Missouri.
[01:17:20.904 --> 01:17:21.664]  Paula, go ahead.
[01:17:22.424 --> 01:17:22.684]  Hello?
[01:17:23.064 --> 01:17:23.244]  Yes.
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:24.740]  Alex.
[01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:25.361]  Yes.
[01:17:25.461 --> 01:17:31.004]  I wanted to quote that scripture, but I see everybody else has done the same thing.
[01:17:31.044 --> 01:17:32.284]  It says the same thing in my Bible.
[01:17:32.825 --> 01:17:37.547]  I guess that pastor earned his 30 pieces of silver, didn't he?
[01:17:39.228 --> 01:17:40.008]  I guess he did.
[01:17:40.729 --> 01:17:42.830]  Yep.
[01:17:44.171 --> 01:17:45.371]  Okay, that's all I wanted to tell you.
[01:17:45.772 --> 01:17:48.173]  What did you think of what's happening to Mr. Rushing?
[01:17:48.913 --> 01:17:53.936]  That's all part of their program, and I haven't seen it.
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:54.841]  Uh...
[01:17:56.314 --> 01:17:58.255]  But I keep hearing about it, different things.
[01:17:58.675 --> 01:18:00.496]  You know, I've got a pretty good memory.
[01:18:00.536 --> 01:18:05.819]  Didn't you call about a year ago and said that you'd stop on the side of the road and give police my videos?
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:07.700]  I did.
[01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:10.161]  I gave a couple of them, yes, and they never did bother me.
[01:18:10.541 --> 01:18:13.443]  Well, I want to find out if my memory's activated.
[01:18:13.463 --> 01:18:15.084]  That was about 14 months ago.
[01:18:15.104 --> 01:18:15.484]  Right.
[01:18:15.744 --> 01:18:19.686]  You called the show and you said you were handing out my videos to police on the side of the road.
[01:18:19.866 --> 01:18:20.166]  Yeah.
[01:18:20.647 --> 01:18:22.127]  And what happens to you when you do that?
[01:18:22.347 --> 01:18:22.708]  Nothing.
[01:18:23.248 --> 01:18:25.289]  Looks like they haven't gotten their proper programming.
[01:18:25.976 --> 01:18:26.136]  Right.
[01:18:27.116 --> 01:18:32.118]  No, the FEMA footage I've got where they say all Christians are terrorists was shot in Kansas City.
[01:18:32.598 --> 01:18:32.838]  Yeah.
[01:18:33.579 --> 01:18:36.920]  So these guys are the ones that I have approached.
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:45.563]  They were the younger generation, younger guys, and I explained to them about it, and they said, sure, I'll look at it.
[01:18:47.043 --> 01:18:50.004]  Well, in the future, they'll just arrest you, and so that's threatening.
[01:18:50.064 --> 01:18:52.965]  The judge will say, you're not allowed to give videos to people.
[01:18:53.905 --> 01:18:54.746]  That's evil!
[01:18:54.766 --> 01:18:54.846]  Yeah.
[01:18:56.656 --> 01:18:57.617]  Well, thank you for the call.
[01:18:57.897 --> 01:18:58.197]  Okay.
[01:18:58.417 --> 01:18:59.178]  God bless you.
[01:18:59.478 --> 01:19:01.299]  Folks, this is shaking me up.
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:04.542]  I just, I start thinking about it.
[01:19:04.582 --> 01:19:07.824]  I've got Law Enforcement Technology Magazine, and it says,
[01:19:08.883 --> 01:19:16.308]  If you pull somebody over, or it says pull them over if they've got a sticker that says get us out of the U.N., go ahead and take them in.
[01:19:16.828 --> 01:19:19.670]  And police chiefs, don't chastise your officers for doing this.
[01:19:20.171 --> 01:19:21.452]  These are generally terrorists.
[01:19:21.472 --> 01:19:24.153]  The criminals need to be going ahead and taking on in.
[01:19:24.454 --> 01:19:31.638]  A major national publication, echoing what FEMA and the ADL are teaching everybody, says, you've got an anti-U.N.
[01:19:31.879 --> 01:19:35.081]  sticker on your car, go ahead and take you on into jail.
[01:19:37.475 --> 01:19:46.638]  That is so un-American, that makes me just absolute... Oh, folks, if you don't know this is bad, then something's wrong with you.
[01:19:47.398 --> 01:19:51.219]  Come back, take a few more calls, and get into the news, and we got Hutton Gibson coming up.
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.161]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[01:19:56.681 --> 01:20:00.102]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[01:20:00.602 --> 01:20:01.282]  Let's update.
[01:20:01.782 --> 01:20:05.224]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[01:20:07.148 --> 01:20:09.609]  The NASDAQ in that same time frame is flat.
[01:20:10.289 --> 01:20:11.230]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:13.571]  dollar was worth 17% more than the euro.
[01:20:14.111 --> 01:20:15.012]  Today, the U.S.
[01:20:15.032 --> 01:20:17.253]  dollar is worth 28% less than the euro.
[01:20:17.673 --> 01:20:19.193]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[01:20:19.774 --> 01:20:21.755]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283.
[01:20:23.115 --> 01:20:27.977]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[01:20:28.958 --> 01:20:29.718]  Gold is moving.
[01:20:29.958 --> 01:20:31.119]  Equities are treading water.
[01:20:31.539 --> 01:20:34.200]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:36.061]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[01:20:36.533 --> 01:20:37.034]  We're good to go.
[01:20:53.737 --> 01:20:55.778]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[01:20:55.958 --> 01:20:57.598]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot.
[01:20:57.718 --> 01:21:05.701]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[01:21:05.961 --> 01:21:12.383]  Imagine hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini, followed by peaches, mixed root, or pineapple for dessert.
[01:21:12.563 --> 01:21:13.804]  Just a few of the many selections.
[01:21:14.024 --> 01:21:17.425]  Visit www.longlifefood.com for a complete menu.
[01:21:17.545 --> 01:21:21.126]  Both FEMA and the Red Cross have suggested having food stored in case of disaster.
[01:21:21.326 --> 01:21:26.848]  The Long Life Food Depot was recently mentioned in the USA Today article on the very subject of emergency preparations.
[01:21:27.148 --> 01:21:29.870]  It makes sense to be prepared, and Long Life Food Depot makes it easy.
[01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:34.071]  Long-term storable MREs make for convenience when camping, hiking, or canoeing.
[01:21:34.311 --> 01:21:36.332]  No fires allowed, hot meals still are.

[01:21:52.497 --> 01:21:59.999]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey light LED system.
[01:22:00.279 --> 01:22:13.222]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[01:22:13.542 --> 01:22:16.863]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:22:17.203 --> 01:22:27.666]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:22:27.946 --> 01:22:28.447]  That's right.
[01:22:28.627 --> 01:22:35.749]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:22:36.029 --> 01:22:42.331]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by

[01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:48.234]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:23:55.859 --> 01:24:01.883]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:24:01.903 --> 01:24:05.465]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:08.849 --> 01:24:12.251]  You know, I've got to work harder.
[01:24:14.152 --> 01:24:33.764]  I need to take all the news articles about the FBI training manuals, Project Megiddo, the video clip of FEMA saying all the Christians are terrorists, all of this, the law enforcement technology magazine that said if somebody's got an anti-UN sticker, go ahead and arrest them, go ahead and take them on downtown.
[01:24:36.235 --> 01:24:41.517]  And take all these stories and put it together in one big article with hyperlinks and video clips and documents.
[01:24:42.118 --> 01:24:46.339]  And then, you know, have everybody email that around so millions of people can see it.
[01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:52.602]  Because what they've done to police is, over the last 50 years, is they say, okay, we're going to frame criminals.
[01:24:53.222 --> 01:24:55.483]  But, you know, we know somebody's guilty, we'll go ahead and frame them.
[01:24:55.863 --> 01:24:59.345]  So they get cops to kind of, you know, get into that evil and start it.
[01:24:59.485 --> 01:25:03.987]  Then it just becomes institutionalized where if you don't like somebody, just charge them with something.
[01:25:05.792 --> 01:25:15.956]  And then the ADL, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, and the Southern Poverty Law Center in their own manuals, which are written for the police, explain to them how they can get this done.
[01:25:16.457 --> 01:25:19.238]  And then they go out and carry it out against the general public.
[01:25:19.258 --> 01:25:22.319]  I mean, they come after you.
[01:25:22.339 --> 01:25:28.562]  If you're a Christian, if you're a homeschooler, if you're into anything decent, you're under attack because you threaten the New World Order.
[01:25:29.162 --> 01:25:32.403]  Diana in Colorado, then John, James, Tracy, Betty, and others.
[01:25:33.164 --> 01:25:34.004]  Diane, go ahead.
[01:25:34.747 --> 01:25:35.227]  Hi, Alex.
[01:25:35.287 --> 01:25:37.028]  My name's actually Deanna, but that's all right.
[01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:45.234]  I'm calling in about the pastor who was on the show in the first hour, and I'd just like to defend him in a couple of areas.
[01:25:45.714 --> 01:25:55.380]  The verse that you cited, I went to 16 years of Christian elementary school, high school, college, and I've read the gospel several times.
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:56.721]  Hold on just a second.
[01:25:57.021 --> 01:25:57.221]  Yeah?
[01:25:57.981 --> 01:25:59.202]  Are you for gun control?
[01:25:59.823 --> 01:26:00.183]  I'm not.
[01:26:01.152 --> 01:26:08.617]  Okay, well, the preacher, for those who don't know, just joined us in the last hour who had a gun buyback in Dallas that ABC News reported on.
[01:26:10.318 --> 01:26:18.283]  He was saying that he didn't know that in the Gospel of Luke that Christ said, sell your clothes and buy a sword.
[01:26:18.884 --> 01:26:19.164]  Right.
[01:26:20.025 --> 01:26:20.625]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:26:21.606 --> 01:26:28.230]  I would like to say, though, that the many times that I've read the Gospels, that verse has never jumped out at me, and it makes sense to me that people who are
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:29.120]  Okay.
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:31.302]  The real point that I wanted to make was that I...
[01:26:56.641 --> 01:27:02.084]  I sort of feel bad for your unsuspecting interviewees sometimes because I don't think that they know what they're getting into.
[01:27:02.284 --> 01:27:04.445]  That's right, they don't.
[01:27:04.465 --> 01:27:10.708]  I felt a little bit bad for him because it seemed to me like he really has no bad intentions for what he's doing.
[01:27:12.159 --> 01:27:15.460]  His point that, you know, the first woman who gave up her gun was a grandmother.
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:19.682]  Do you realize how dangerous these useful idiots are?
[01:27:19.702 --> 01:27:20.482]  I do.
[01:27:20.682 --> 01:27:23.683]  Do you realize that they're preparing to put us all in concentration camps?
[01:27:23.984 --> 01:27:26.705]  That's the head of NORTHCOM right there in Colorado Springs.
[01:27:27.025 --> 01:27:29.226]  Yes, I listen to your show all the time, Alex.
[01:27:29.486 --> 01:27:32.847]  And I, you know, I'm on your site all the time.
[01:27:33.667 --> 01:27:35.368]  Listen, that's why I'm upset.
[01:27:35.848 --> 01:27:40.650]  This country is bleeding to death right in front of me, and I'm a little freaked out right now.
[01:27:41.677 --> 01:27:47.804]  The one thing I want to say is that I just think he's a little bit misinformed.
[01:27:47.824 --> 01:27:51.989]  I think for him, the way he's going to get the message is if
[01:27:52.925 --> 01:27:58.227]  If we gently inform him, I think probably him feeling attacked isn't going to change his mind.
[01:27:58.287 --> 01:27:59.467]  He'll probably just get defensive.
[01:27:59.507 --> 01:28:00.187]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:28:00.868 --> 01:28:01.388]  I hear you.
[01:28:01.408 --> 01:28:02.528]  Thanks for the call.
[01:28:02.588 --> 01:28:03.168]  I appreciate it.
[01:28:03.188 --> 01:28:04.769]  I'm a little bit defensive right now.
[01:28:05.269 --> 01:28:06.449]  John in Virginia.
[01:28:06.549 --> 01:28:07.530]  John, you're on the air.
[01:28:07.630 --> 01:28:08.090]  Go ahead.
[01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:09.110]  Alex, how you doing?
[01:28:09.130 --> 01:28:15.212]  I called up and was going to talk about one thing, and after your caller in Kentucky, by golly, that got a whole other train of thought going.
[01:28:16.632 --> 01:28:18.593]  Listen, I just wanted to give my heads up this.
[01:28:19.793 --> 01:28:21.734]  I know in different parts of the state,
[01:28:22.535 --> 01:28:32.963]  Our country, I should say, that once a restraining order is put out against you, and that sounds like what was put out against him, it becomes a felony for you to have access to a firearm.
[01:28:32.983 --> 01:28:35.605]  I have a friend of mine that's in Georgia that's going through that right now.
[01:28:35.705 --> 01:28:36.886]  It seems as a course of...
[01:28:38.379 --> 01:28:44.742]  Just what happens when you... And they told him, they told him, you can leave the jail when you sign this, and he fell for it.
[01:28:44.962 --> 01:28:46.303]  Well, you know what?
[01:28:46.763 --> 01:28:49.985]  Ignorance is not bliss, and he's not to be faulted for it.
[01:28:50.145 --> 01:28:51.445]  A lot of people do that.
[01:28:51.926 --> 01:29:05.252]  A friend of mine is going through a divorce in Georgia, and just as a routine matter of occurrence, judges down there issue restraining orders against the husbands, which means if the husbands have a gun in the house,
[01:29:06.228 --> 01:29:08.449]  They all of a sudden are a felon.
[01:29:08.509 --> 01:29:11.670]  Same thing in Texas and all over the country.
[01:29:11.710 --> 01:29:15.231]  You're automatically convicted even if it's a no-fault divorce.
[01:29:15.531 --> 01:29:28.296]  Well, he may want to talk with an attorney down there and really find out because he may get a knock at the door at about 3 o'clock and somebody do a random search in his house because really it could go from real bad to real worse real quick.
[01:29:29.022 --> 01:29:38.490]  Yeah, that's our free country, our wondrous free country, where the police manuals and magazines say, if they got an anti-UN sticker, go ahead and arrest them.
[01:29:39.050 --> 01:29:41.012]  Yeah, that's what America's all about.
[01:29:43.294 --> 01:29:44.234]  We're on the march.
[01:29:44.675 --> 01:29:46.296]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.217 --> 01:29:49.879]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:52.845 --> 01:31:56.448]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[01:31:56.688 --> 01:31:58.090]  If so, hope has arrived.
[01:31:58.590 --> 01:32:00.031]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[01:32:00.292 --> 01:32:05.456]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.

[01:32:19.768 --> 01:32:20.888]  Gum disease is serious.
[01:32:21.389 --> 01:32:25.130]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[01:32:25.410 --> 01:32:32.032]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including vitamin toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.

[01:34:51.183 --> 01:34:53.464]  And as the years progress, more and more people.
[01:34:54.465 --> 01:34:55.885]  So the globalists better watch it.
[01:34:55.945 --> 01:34:59.626]  Just in my life, I've done 1,400 radio interviews.
[01:34:59.806 --> 01:35:04.688]  I haven't counted them up since 1,300, but I've done well over 100 the last few months, so it's upwards of 1,400.
[01:35:04.768 --> 01:35:09.310]  And everywhere I go, people are waking up.
[01:35:09.570 --> 01:35:09.930]  I'll do...
[01:35:10.888 --> 01:35:15.072]  Again, two, three, four radio interviews a day, and no one calls in the disagrees.
[01:35:16.793 --> 01:35:18.334]  Five years ago, the complete opposite.
[01:35:20.296 --> 01:35:33.387]  So we're winning the fight, and so the criminals out there that engage in this globalist activity, you need to know that we're on to you, we're on to your corruption, we know what you're doing, people are waking up to history, you're in a lot of trouble.
[01:35:35.128 --> 01:35:40.732]  1-888-253-3139 is the toll-free number, or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:35:40.772 --> 01:35:43.153]  Now, I'm going to go to these calls really fast.
[01:35:54.043 --> 01:35:55.364]  So, make your point.
[01:35:55.924 --> 01:35:57.085]  John, you were finishing up.
[01:35:57.125 --> 01:35:58.065]  Go ahead in Virginia.
[01:35:58.246 --> 01:36:02.528]  I was just going to say, Alex, we don't want to paint these police with too broad a brush.
[01:36:02.548 --> 01:36:04.189]  Some of these guys are really good.
[01:36:04.229 --> 01:36:05.089]  They're on our side.
[01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:06.470]  They understand what's going on.
[01:36:06.490 --> 01:36:07.511]  That's what I was just saying.
[01:36:07.591 --> 01:36:08.931]  You're waking up a lot of them.
[01:36:09.112 --> 01:36:09.612]  Absolutely.
[01:36:09.632 --> 01:36:16.656]  Now, as far as your pastor goes, our problem is we have a bunch of 501c3 corporations that call themselves churches.
[01:36:17.436 --> 01:36:27.384]  And you should have asked the pastor this, and you can't think everything, but you know the Presbyterian Church, from the hierarchy down, has said that gay marriages now are acceptable.
[01:36:27.404 --> 01:36:30.787]  I mean, you do know that's the Presbyterian stand on gay marriages, right?
[01:36:30.927 --> 01:36:31.287]  Yes.
[01:36:32.028 --> 01:36:34.189]  That would have been an interesting question for that fellow.
[01:36:34.429 --> 01:36:36.231]  Also, and it's destroying their church.
[01:36:36.271 --> 01:36:37.792]  All over the world, people are leaving.
[01:36:38.653 --> 01:36:45.078]  And on top of it, I know the Presbyterians are getting some of the faith-based initiative funds that, by the way, did go through.
[01:36:45.719 --> 01:36:47.081]  It just hasn't been totally legalized.
[01:36:47.101 --> 01:36:48.083]  They're just doing it anyways.
[01:36:48.705 --> 01:36:51.090]  So this is part of the federal funding of the churches.
[01:36:51.410 --> 01:36:51.931]  Absolutely.
[01:36:51.951 --> 01:36:53.555]  And if they come out and they talk about
[01:36:54.468 --> 01:37:04.692]  Government policy, if they come out against government policy, the IRS has come in and they've already said they would yank their 501c3 status and pull their church away from them.
[01:37:04.832 --> 01:37:07.753]  And the answer, but if they grovel, they'll get federal money.
[01:37:08.033 --> 01:37:11.354]  The answer is having all our churches say no, we'll talk about whatever we want.
[01:37:11.414 --> 01:37:12.034]  Thanks for the call.
[01:37:12.274 --> 01:37:12.595]  Absolutely.
[01:37:12.915 --> 01:37:13.775]  Appreciate it.
[01:37:13.815 --> 01:37:15.356]  Let's talk to James in Colorado.
[01:37:15.376 --> 01:37:16.196]  James, go ahead.
[01:37:17.116 --> 01:37:17.816]  Hey, Alex Jones.
[01:37:20.177 --> 01:37:20.978]  Turn that radio down.
[01:37:20.998 --> 01:37:22.218]  Please.
[01:37:24.758 --> 01:37:28.400]  Most of the people, I'm not trying to accuse them, but they know not what they do.
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:32.182]  They've made this social structure and traditions of men God.
[01:37:33.122 --> 01:37:36.103]  They use Colossians 2.16 to defend pagan traditions.
[01:37:37.384 --> 01:37:40.345]  If it doesn't say to do it in the Bible, why add the tradition?
[01:37:40.885 --> 01:37:50.429]  And I'm trying to make the link between why my gun is missing, it's been repossessed, and why people are walking around in a trance saying, there's nothing wrong, we're still free.
[01:37:52.625 --> 01:37:53.645]  What happened to your gun?
[01:37:53.665 --> 01:37:58.206]  I pawned it, and I didn't pass the background check to redeem it.
[01:38:01.527 --> 01:38:08.188]  I see articles all the time where people with no criminal record are failing the background checks, the NICS registration system, and that's what it is.
[01:38:08.248 --> 01:38:10.609]  Gun dealers say, don't say it's a registration.
[01:38:10.669 --> 01:38:11.069]  It's not.
[01:38:11.509 --> 01:38:13.209]  Yes, it is.
[01:38:13.329 --> 01:38:18.630]  And if the gun dealers would get active and say no until the NRA no, we'd get our guns back.
[01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:21.771]  But instead, compromise, compromise, compromise.
[01:38:22.529 --> 01:38:33.480]  And also, in Jeremiah chapter 10, 1 through 5, and a few other scriptures refer to specific traditions of men.
[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:35.843]  Like, where did Valentine's Day come from?
[01:38:35.923 --> 01:38:37.404]  Is that something out of the Bible?
[01:38:37.524 --> 01:38:38.205]  I don't think so.
[01:38:38.766 --> 01:38:39.727]  Thanks for the call.
[01:38:40.087 --> 01:38:40.868]  No, I hear you.
[01:38:40.968 --> 01:38:41.989]  It's all been paganized.
[01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:43.791]  Who's up next, Stephanie?
[01:38:44.989 --> 01:38:45.890]  Tracy in Vermont.
[01:38:45.930 --> 01:38:46.791]  Go ahead.
[01:38:46.811 --> 01:38:46.851]  Hi.
[01:38:46.911 --> 01:38:48.252]  First time caller, Alex.
[01:38:48.812 --> 01:38:50.053]  I just want to bring up a point.
[01:38:50.073 --> 01:38:53.936]  We have to look at the bigger picture as far as the sword situation.
[01:38:54.297 --> 01:38:57.299]  And there's the scripture in Isaiah 2-4.
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:00.441]  If anybody's ever been in the U.N.
[01:39:00.462 --> 01:39:08.928]  building when you first walk in, in the lobby or whatever they call it, it's the scripture Isaiah 2-4.
[01:39:08.968 --> 01:39:14.653]  He shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many people and they shall beat their swords in the plowshares.
[01:39:15.236 --> 01:39:18.437]  And there's spears in the pruning hook.
[01:39:18.857 --> 01:39:23.399]  Nations shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.
[01:39:23.939 --> 01:39:31.161]  And we know the globalists are responsible for the gun or weapon control through the U.N.
[01:39:31.221 --> 01:39:31.961]  We know the U.N.
[01:39:31.981 --> 01:39:33.142]  Let me give you the U.N.
[01:39:33.162 --> 01:39:36.563]  quote from July 7, 2001 at the Small Arms Summit in New York by Una Deer.
[01:39:44.418 --> 01:39:51.001]  And it is, quote, civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[01:39:51.462 --> 01:39:53.223]  Power monopoly is dictatorship.
[01:39:53.463 --> 01:39:53.963]  The U.N.
[01:39:54.003 --> 01:39:57.024]  says citizens owning guns threatens their dictatorship.
[01:39:57.044 --> 01:39:57.445]  Go ahead.
[01:39:59.046 --> 01:40:00.346]  We know the U.N.
[01:40:00.406 --> 01:40:05.869]  is responsible for the gun control, well, the globalists through the U.N., and we know the U.N.
[01:40:05.929 --> 01:40:11.172]  is not a Christian organization, and when we see that scripture in the U.N.
[01:40:11.212 --> 01:40:11.672]  lobby,
[01:40:12.179 --> 01:40:18.822]  They're planting their heaven on earth, and this is a way of conditioning the people to give up their guns, to give up their weapons.
[01:40:19.982 --> 01:40:27.025]  We're so brainwashed and so conditioned in this world, and especially in this country, peace, peace, peace, nonviolence.
[01:40:27.185 --> 01:40:33.147]  Well, Alex, I commend all the work that you've done, and especially your wife for letting you do it.
[01:40:33.187 --> 01:40:33.867]  She's a saint.
[01:40:34.888 --> 01:40:40.110]  And you motivate me and many others that I know, and just thank you, thank you, thank you.
[01:40:43.130 --> 01:40:47.071]  Well, I agree with you, and this whole peace thing...
[01:40:47.961 --> 01:40:48.961]  That they come out with.
[01:40:49.021 --> 01:40:51.422]  That means we're supposed to lay down to their tyranny.
[01:40:51.482 --> 01:40:52.703]  We're supposed to submit.
[01:40:53.483 --> 01:40:55.244]  When they say peace, that's what they mean.
[01:40:55.444 --> 01:41:03.787]  It's a very dangerous concept that they even use the Holy Bible, you know, as scripture to back up what they're doing.
[01:41:03.827 --> 01:41:07.768]  And we know that they're of the devil, the UN.
[01:41:07.808 --> 01:41:09.489]  They're not a Christian organization.
[01:41:09.769 --> 01:41:13.170]  And the pastors need to understand this, and especially this pastor.
[01:41:13.530 --> 01:41:15.771]  In the beginning of your program, he's a charlatan.
[01:41:15.811 --> 01:41:18.412]  He's a New World Order minion, as far as I'm concerned.
[01:41:18.592 --> 01:41:19.052]  I hear you.
[01:41:19.112 --> 01:41:20.912]  He's brainwashed and conditioned himself.
[01:41:21.092 --> 01:41:21.813]  Thanks for the call.
[01:41:21.913 --> 01:41:23.393]  Betty in Ohio, go ahead.
[01:41:23.413 --> 01:41:24.874]  Hi.
[01:41:26.214 --> 01:41:33.136]  What she's referring to on the UN happens to be the scripture that's going to be used to form the One World Church, the ecumenical movement.
[01:41:33.216 --> 01:41:40.898]  It's not about peace as it should be defined, but peace as a New World Order religion.
[01:41:41.599 --> 01:41:42.479]  The other thing about that
[01:41:43.257 --> 01:41:46.299]  Verse is being taken out of context in Luke 22, 36.
[01:41:47.219 --> 01:41:53.142]  Nowhere in the Pauline epistles or anywhere in the Gospels are there any examples that we're to live by the sword.
[01:41:54.583 --> 01:41:55.784]  I'm not anti-gun.
[01:41:56.344 --> 01:41:57.205]  Well, that's not true.
[01:41:57.245 --> 01:42:01.227]  The entire Bible is about people defending themselves against tyranny.
[01:42:01.467 --> 01:42:02.848]  But not since Jesus came.
[01:42:02.948 --> 01:42:04.509]  That was in the Old Testament.
[01:42:04.549 --> 01:42:08.711]  I've read the Bible more than... So it was wrong that the Founding Fathers stood up to England.
[01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:13.532]  No, the truth of the scriptures are this, and that we... Well, let me just tell you something.
[01:42:13.592 --> 01:42:19.135]  I'm going to defend my family, and I could have a hundred pastors on here to repeat what you're saying.
[01:42:19.556 --> 01:42:27.200]  Well, I'm not... Look, you know, there's plenty of scriptures to refute it, to refute the fact that we are to not live like that.
[01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:35.005]  It says, blessed are the peacemakers, and that don't mean... Yeah, and you make peace by defending and by going after the enemies that are attacking you.
[01:42:35.345 --> 01:42:37.506]  Well, if you'll let me explain, that verse in 2236 of Luke...
[01:42:39.298 --> 01:42:40.118]  That's not what it means.
[01:42:40.138 --> 01:42:41.479]  It's been taken out of context.
[01:42:41.579 --> 01:42:46.160]  It is in no wise meant for us to go arm, to fight.
[01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:49.361]  I've read the whole thing, and that's not true, and thanks for the call.
[01:42:49.661 --> 01:42:50.361]  Thanks for the call.
[01:42:50.401 --> 01:42:52.782]  Hitler was for gun control, and the Bible's not for Hitler.
[01:42:53.242 --> 01:42:54.343]  Okay, let's go ahead.
[01:42:54.403 --> 01:42:56.723]  I mean, it boils down to stuff real simple like that.
[01:42:57.544 --> 01:43:01.565]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ron in Oklahoma.
[01:43:01.645 --> 01:43:02.445]  Ron, go ahead.
[01:43:02.845 --> 01:43:04.846]  Okay, Alex, two things quickly here.
[01:43:05.046 --> 01:43:07.627]  One, the problem in Kentucky is called by...
[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:10.421]  I was by ignorance.
[01:43:10.521 --> 01:43:21.746]  I think it's time for your listeners around the United States and around the world to contact their friends and relatives in the state of Kentucky and enlighten them as to what's really going on.
[01:43:22.167 --> 01:43:28.070]  And for those that just joined us, recap what has happened to Kelly Rushing.
[01:43:28.430 --> 01:43:38.515]  Well, apparently Mr. Rushing left some videotapes in the mailbox of a Kentucky state trooper, and this state trooper arrested him and charged him with terrorism.
[01:43:39.571 --> 01:43:43.572]  So the people of Kentucky need to be enlightened.
[01:43:43.612 --> 01:43:52.735]  The best way I can think of would be for your listeners to contact their friends and relatives in the state of Kentucky and enlighten these people.
[01:43:53.136 --> 01:43:57.457]  Tell them about Alex Jones, John Stett Miller, what's going on.
[01:43:58.508 --> 01:44:02.071]  And send them your videotypes and books, etc.
[01:44:02.511 --> 01:44:03.172]  No, I agree.
[01:44:03.212 --> 01:44:08.836]  We need to flood that county with these videos, which the police seem to think are illegal.
[01:44:09.076 --> 01:44:19.024]  The judge told him, according to Kelly Rushing, he said, look, you are guilty of giving a police officer an anti-government, anti-police video.
[01:44:20.407 --> 01:44:24.628]  I mean, folks, one of my videos is aired on national television.
[01:44:24.728 --> 01:44:26.528]  I've been interviewed by national TV.
[01:44:27.648 --> 01:44:30.929]  2020, Good Morning America, hard copy, extra, C-SPAN.
[01:44:32.069 --> 01:44:38.050]  The point here is that it's not illegal to make films and to write books, but these people think it is.
[01:44:38.690 --> 01:44:47.832]  I have major law enforcement publications, magazines, documents, where they say if you've got an anti-UN bumper sticker on your car, go ahead and arrest them.
[01:44:49.542 --> 01:44:51.002]  I mean, that's not America, Ron.
[01:44:51.582 --> 01:44:52.063]  Oh, sir, it is.
[01:44:52.243 --> 01:45:03.905]  Also, Alex, campus censorship lifting is the title of a short John Leo syndicated column from today's Oklahoma, and I'd like to read to you real quickly if I can.
[01:45:03.925 --> 01:45:04.505]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:45:04.946 --> 01:45:13.968]  An actual debate on the merits of racial preference has taken place on an American campus, Utah State University, where the Guinness Book of Records is interested in this news.
[01:45:14.048 --> 01:45:14.868]  I am not certain.
[01:45:15.008 --> 01:45:15.588]  I know I am.
[01:45:16.098 --> 01:45:22.159]  Astonishingly, the university administration did not step in to halt proceedings on the grounds that feelings might be hurt.
[01:45:22.519 --> 01:45:25.260]  The debate was civil, with some booing and cheering on both sides.
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:33.581]  Some students seemed a bit testy or angry, but as one student sponsor of the debate said, that's part of politics and discussing diversity of issues.
[01:45:34.162 --> 01:45:36.262]  This breakthrough raises a startling question.
[01:45:36.522 --> 01:45:40.043]  Is it possible that other universities will begin experimenting with free speech?
[01:45:40.583 --> 01:45:40.963]  Could it be?
[01:45:41.888 --> 01:45:45.829]  Well, let me stop right there.
[01:45:45.889 --> 01:45:58.851]  There's a big professor out in California who simply said that Palestinians are kept in the equivalent of concentration camps, and that it's wrong, and the ADL is trying to get him fired now just for criticizing Israel.
[01:45:58.911 --> 01:46:01.072]  Now criticizing Israel's anti-Semitic.
[01:46:01.752 --> 01:46:03.052]  Oh, now you're a terrorist.
[01:46:03.092 --> 01:46:06.833]  See, I mean, this isn't America anymore if we put up with this, people.
[01:46:09.844 --> 01:46:21.772]  Could it be, Alex, the fog of censorship on campuses is beginning to lift thanks to the pressure of litigation, bad publicity, and ridicule from a new and more pugnacious generation of collegians?
[01:46:22.232 --> 01:46:36.561]  The litigation is being handled by groups such as the Center for Individual Rights, the Alliance Defense Fund, and most spectacularly, by the Philadelphia-based Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, which is now a major player in the campus wars.
[01:46:37.011 --> 01:46:46.476]  These groups have been winning free speech cases one after another, creating momentum that is forcing many censorship-minded administrators into a defensive crowd.
[01:46:46.937 --> 01:46:50.859]  By the way, Ron, I have had some of those groups on.
[01:46:50.919 --> 01:46:52.319]  Read the names of those groups again.
[01:46:52.359 --> 01:46:56.762]  Those are some good groups for Kelly rushing to get a hold of.
[01:46:56.802 --> 01:46:58.163]  The Center for Individual Rights.
[01:46:58.323 --> 01:46:58.583]  Right.
[01:46:58.663 --> 01:47:00.644]  This is one reason I brought it up, Alex.
[01:47:00.984 --> 01:47:05.827]  The litigation is being handled by groups such as the Center for Individual Rights,
[01:47:06.678 --> 01:47:16.182]  Alliant, Defense Fund, and most spectacularly, by the Philadelphia Faith Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.
[01:47:18.443 --> 01:47:22.244]  Those groups, and this was a syndicated column by John... I hear you, Ron.
[01:47:22.264 --> 01:47:22.985]  I've got to let you go.
[01:47:23.005 --> 01:47:23.925]  I've got to let you go.
[01:47:24.085 --> 01:47:25.045]  And I've got loaded phones.
[01:47:25.085 --> 01:47:27.606]  I'm not going to be able to go to calls until later in the next hour.
[01:47:27.646 --> 01:47:34.009]  I'm not even sure I'll take calls for Hudson Gibson if we get through all the material we may or if he wants to take calls.
[01:47:34.989 --> 01:47:36.169]  Got so much news here.
[01:47:36.810 --> 01:47:39.250]  Everything we've talked about has been very important as well.
[01:47:41.731 --> 01:47:42.851]  Yes, that is encouraging.
[01:47:43.812 --> 01:47:45.172]  I think I've interviewed most of those groups.
[01:47:45.212 --> 01:47:53.435]  Center for Individual Rights and the Defense Fund.
[01:47:54.095 --> 01:47:54.895]  Folks, help me.
[01:47:55.135 --> 01:48:00.157]  Send me any good groups out there that have helped fight tyranny and violations of the First Amendment.
[01:48:01.137 --> 01:48:03.458]  Send those to tips at infowars.com.
[01:48:03.498 --> 01:48:04.538]  I'm going to have to get with
[01:48:05.656 --> 01:48:13.566]  Kelly rushing, do research, get the documents, confirm his case, and then I'm going to have to write an article about it and try to get him some help.
[01:48:13.826 --> 01:48:16.750]  And my phone's running off the hook with stuff like this.
[01:48:16.850 --> 01:48:20.114]  I'm very frustrated that there's no way to cover it at all.
[01:48:21.395 --> 01:48:23.418]  In fact, let me just shotgun out some of the news here.
[01:48:24.821 --> 01:48:25.381]  Some good news.
[01:48:25.461 --> 01:48:27.982]  State House passes bill outlawing abortion.
[01:48:28.382 --> 01:48:32.524]  Support in Senate for measure challenging Roe v. Wade decision.
[01:48:32.544 --> 01:48:38.546]  The South Dakota State House has passed a bill that would outlaw abortion and challenge the landmark Roe v. Wade decision.
[01:48:39.846 --> 01:48:42.647]  Approved 54-14 after two hours of emotional debate.
[01:48:43.267 --> 01:48:46.648]  The bill would make the practice of abortion a felony carrying a five-year sentence.
[01:48:47.949 --> 01:48:49.069]  A public interest law firm...
[01:48:50.054 --> 01:48:54.176]  That it worked with lawmakers to drop the bill says it designed to have the U.S.
[01:48:54.196 --> 01:49:01.379]  Supreme Court reconsider its 73 Roe v. Wade decision, which struck down state laws banning abortion.
[01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:03.220]  So good news there.
[01:49:03.741 --> 01:49:14.306]  But watch the neocons of the Supreme Court re-rule on Roe v. Wade in a pro-death fashion.
[01:49:15.126 --> 01:49:19.268]  Really scary article out of the New York Times today.
[01:49:20.743 --> 01:49:26.807]  New York police take broad steps in facing terror, meeting in secret and coordinating complex drills.
[01:49:27.187 --> 01:49:31.530]  The department has brought together government agencies in a broad effort for much of last year.
[01:49:31.590 --> 01:49:38.115]  In doing so, it has put together a program that some national security and law enforcement officials describe as unrivaled among American cities.
[01:49:39.156 --> 01:49:45.380]  Now, in this lengthy article, they get into the forced roundups, the forced inoculations, the quarantines, the sports stadiums.
[01:49:46.181 --> 01:49:49.822]  This is the government's smoke screen for a total lockdown.
[01:49:49.882 --> 01:49:55.344]  And we have the head of NORTHCOM, General Eberhardt, in the LA Times saying martial law is a good thing.
[01:49:55.764 --> 01:49:58.405]  The outgoing head of CENTCOM, Tommy Franks, has said it.
[01:50:00.085 --> 01:50:00.686]  It's happening.
[01:50:01.726 --> 01:50:05.527]  Again, I cannot stress how serious things are right now.
[01:50:06.547 --> 01:50:07.588]  And it's a chilling article.
[01:50:07.608 --> 01:50:08.248]  You need to read it.
[01:50:09.328 --> 01:50:11.409]  Catastrophic attack possible, Bush says.
[01:50:12.273 --> 01:50:19.257]  Associated Press, the United States still faces the threat of catastrophic attack by nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons, President George Bush said.
[01:50:19.997 --> 01:50:33.043]  The possibility of secret and sudden attack with weapons of mass destruction is the greatest threat before humanity today, he said, as he highlighted his security credentials in a weekly radio address gearing to his campaign for this year's election.
[01:50:33.924 --> 01:50:36.545]  And see, they can blow something up and say, see, we told you so.
[01:50:37.246 --> 01:50:38.266]  Give all your rights up.
[01:50:38.466 --> 01:50:39.907]  China transferred nuclear weapons...
[01:50:40.675 --> 01:50:41.936]  Designs to Pakistan.
[01:50:41.976 --> 01:50:46.800]  We're going to have the UN take over Iraq, as we told you, but now it's official.
[01:50:47.541 --> 01:50:49.323]  It's all coming up, and then Hutton-Gibson.
[01:50:49.343 --> 01:50:50.684]  You don't want to miss the rest of this show.
[01:50:54.471 --> 01:50:58.974]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:50:59.335 --> 01:51:03.418]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:51:03.698 --> 01:51:04.258]  We listened.
[01:51:04.558 --> 01:51:09.542]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:51:09.822 --> 01:51:10.303]  We listened.
[01:51:10.703 --> 01:51:13.725]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:51:14.165 --> 01:51:14.666]  We listened.
[01:51:15.146 --> 01:51:19.208]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:51:19.589 --> 01:51:20.089]  We listened.
[01:51:20.409 --> 01:51:25.652]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:51:26.072 --> 01:51:27.453]  Again, we listened.
[01:51:27.793 --> 01:51:35.177]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.

[01:52:10.250 --> 01:52:14.412]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:52:14.572 --> 01:52:18.354]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[01:52:18.614 --> 01:52:23.197]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:52:23.317 --> 01:52:29.579]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:52:29.639 --> 01:52:31.499]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:52:49.684 --> 01:52:51.745]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.

[01:53:58.436 --> 01:54:00.337]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:54:00.817 --> 01:54:03.598]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:05.099 --> 01:54:06.559]  All right, folks, we're back live.
[01:54:06.620 --> 01:54:08.540]  I was just talking to my wife during the break.
[01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:09.521]  She was listening to the show.
[01:54:10.998 --> 01:54:15.059]  There was a lady called talking about Bible verses and how we're supposed to be armed.
[01:54:16.479 --> 01:54:18.159]  And then she said how great we were.
[01:54:18.379 --> 01:54:19.680]  And I said, well, I agree with you.
[01:54:20.140 --> 01:54:23.260]  And my wife said it sounded like I was saying, yes, I agree with you how great we are.
[01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:29.361]  No, what I meant was, for those that didn't get it, was I agree with what you said in your call.
[01:54:30.082 --> 01:54:31.982]  That's what that meant.
[01:54:32.002 --> 01:54:33.202]  For those that heard that.
[01:54:34.382 --> 01:54:37.143]  Again, we have a lot of unexpected things come up here on the show today.
[01:54:38.504 --> 01:54:41.845]  We've got stacks of news here, but we've got a really important subject coming up.
[01:54:42.725 --> 01:54:47.907]  In Bush's radio address, he said, Intercontinental ballistic missiles are going to get us, give all your rights up, basically.
[01:54:48.247 --> 01:54:49.807]  The tariffs are resourceful.
[01:54:50.767 --> 01:55:00.790]  He said, quote, America faces the possibility of catastrophic attack from ballistic missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction, so we are developing and deploying missile defenses to guard our people.
[01:55:02.136 --> 01:55:07.939]  Well, it's come out that our government's helped arm China, North Korea, Pakistan, allowed Pakistan to transfer these weapons.
[01:55:08.619 --> 01:55:17.824]  So while the government's arming all our enemies, they're telling us, brace for all these attacks, and the terrorists are about to strike us, and Al-Qaeda's got suitcase nukes.
[01:55:18.264 --> 01:55:19.285]  That was last week.
[01:55:20.245 --> 01:55:24.108]  And if they nuke something, it'll be, we're arresting whoever criticized the government.
[01:55:24.128 --> 01:55:25.988]  We've got to do this to keep us safe.
[01:55:26.549 --> 01:55:29.510]  Every time you complain, hey, do you see that smoke in U.S.
[01:55:29.570 --> 01:55:29.931]  cities?
[01:55:30.071 --> 01:55:30.651]  Shut up!
[01:55:32.130 --> 01:55:35.271]  That's why it's so important to expose who's behind the terrorism.
[01:55:36.531 --> 01:55:37.611]  We've got to do it now.
[01:55:39.271 --> 01:55:39.871]  Here's another one.
[01:55:39.911 --> 01:55:44.992]  China transferred nuclear weapons designs to Pakistan, our ally, so has Israel and others.
[01:55:45.092 --> 01:55:55.995]  China has been identified as the original source of nuclear weapons designs found in Libya in the latest disclosure about the global spread of nuclear technology, including to Pakistan.
[01:55:57.475 --> 01:55:58.335]  So that's there.
[01:55:59.423 --> 01:56:07.225]  Meanwhile, the military and the police are training to round you up and forcibly inoculate you and put you in camps for your safety, of course.
[01:56:08.585 --> 01:56:19.007]  This is out of RFID Journal, the official industry publication paid for by the industry, promoting biometrics and other such technologies.
[01:56:20.048 --> 01:56:23.188]  And it says, Oracle speaks of RFID plans.
[01:56:23.228 --> 01:56:23.908]  That's Oracle.
[01:56:24.609 --> 01:56:26.329]  And I saw the CEO back in...
[01:56:29.586 --> 01:56:43.770]  On January 31st, 1999, I saw Scott McKelvey on Lewis Rukeyser's Wall Street Recon Review, and Rukeyser said, what do you look forward to most in the new century?
[01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:49.251]  He said, I look forward to putting a microchip in my son Maverick's neck and tracking everything he does.
[01:56:50.191 --> 01:56:51.272]  So that's Oracle.
[01:56:52.492 --> 01:56:54.292]  No, no, that's Sun Microsystems.
[01:56:54.412 --> 01:56:56.533]  Oracle is the Larry Ellison, the guy that wants to
[01:56:59.211 --> 01:57:00.832]  Make us all take national ID cards.
[01:57:00.892 --> 01:57:01.352]  Excuse me.
[01:57:01.432 --> 01:57:02.732]  I'm a little off today.
[01:57:02.752 --> 01:57:03.513]  I'm pretty upset.
[01:57:04.053 --> 01:57:14.116]  The enterprise software giant sketches out what it will do to help customers meet Walmart and DOD mandates and enable item level tagging.
[01:57:15.856 --> 01:57:16.556]  Now listen to this.
[01:57:16.996 --> 01:57:17.837]  This is very important.
[01:57:19.297 --> 01:57:24.198]  After remaining in the shadows while rival enterprise software maker ASAP
[01:57:27.358 --> 01:57:36.622]  Takes RFID into the enterprise, has public with the RFID plans for years, has finally outlined its plans for supporting RFID.
[01:57:36.642 --> 01:57:39.283]  These are the tiny trackable chips to be in all products.
[01:57:39.323 --> 01:57:40.143]  Walmart's already doing it.
[01:57:40.544 --> 01:57:41.084]  Now listen to this.
[01:57:41.404 --> 01:57:52.709]  While some Oracle customers may see the announcement as long overdue, the company maintains it has been developing support for RFID and electronic product code deployments in its products for some time.
[01:57:53.209 --> 01:58:09.115]  We have been working on prototyping support for RFID for three years now, but we like to do the work first before we make announcements, says John Crowley, Senior Director of Development for Oracle Inventory and Warehouse Management Systems.
[01:58:10.215 --> 01:58:21.880]  At its annual Apps World Conference in January, the company had announced the next release of its Oracle Warehouse Management application which support RFID, and then it goes on to say that...
[01:58:23.254 --> 01:58:28.620]  It is there to support under Department of Defense and Walmart mandates.
[01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:37.508]  So again, the Department of Defense and Walmart a year ago met with Governor Ridge and they're going to force everyone to accept the RFID at the store level.
[01:58:37.849 --> 01:58:38.930]  They're mandating it.
[01:58:40.633 --> 01:58:41.654]  Just amazing.
[01:58:41.674 --> 01:58:42.756]  We'll be back with Hutton Gibson.
[01:58:43.356 --> 01:58:43.957]  Hello, folks.
[01:58:43.977 --> 01:58:44.998]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:58:45.338 --> 01:58:51.064]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:58:51.324 --> 01:58:56.410]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:58:56.790 --> 01:59:06.099]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:11.365]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:59:11.705 --> 01:59:15.709]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:59:15.929 --> 01:59:20.614]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:59:21.034 --> 01:59:21.134]  Yay.
[01:59:21.154 --> 01:59:21.294]  Yay.
[01:59:21.314 --> 01:59:21.414]  Yay.
[01:59:21.434 --> 01:59:21.574]  Yay.
[01:59:50.032 --> 01:59:50.672]  Big Brother.
[01:59:51.332 --> 01:59:52.393]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:53.093 --> 01:59:54.233]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:54.853 --> 01:59:55.673]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.433 --> 01:59:57.354]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.994 --> 02:00:01.674]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.174 --> 02:00:06.295]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.956 --> 02:00:11.056]  All right, my friends.
[02:00:11.936 --> 02:00:16.737]  We're already into the third and final hour of this 16th of February, 2004 Monday edition
[02:00:21.204 --> 02:00:23.086]  We have Hutton Gibson on the line with us.
[02:00:23.106 --> 02:00:26.689]  We've had him on the show, I don't know, four or five times over the last year or so.
[02:00:26.709 --> 02:00:29.391]  Hutton Gibson's a very interesting fella.
[02:00:29.571 --> 02:00:32.974]  He was the national champion of Jeopardy back in the 60s.
[02:00:33.514 --> 02:00:41.741]  Moved his family to Australia and moved back a few years ago to the United States.
[02:00:41.881 --> 02:00:43.423]  And he's been fighting the New World Order.
[02:00:44.407 --> 02:00:56.299]  Speaking and writing a newsletter, and he even made a little TV show that I've aired here locally a few years ago, exposing the corruption in the Catholic Church and how the takeover took place.
[02:00:56.760 --> 02:00:58.962]  And yes, obviously, he's the father of Mel Gibson.
[02:00:59.443 --> 02:01:07.371]  And so you know where Mel Gibson got a lot of his insight into the New World Order, which he speaks about many times when he's in the national news, or when they don't edit that out.
[02:01:08.007 --> 02:01:08.648]  Oh yeah, I'm glad to be here.
[02:01:08.668 --> 02:01:09.228]  Insane as I am.
[02:01:09.248 --> 02:01:09.669]  Yes, I did.
[02:01:28.891 --> 02:01:31.953]  I've been right with the show all morning, all afternoon, whatever.
[02:01:32.674 --> 02:01:36.037]  Well, no, afternoon some places and morning other places.
[02:01:36.057 --> 02:01:36.437]  You're right.
[02:01:37.258 --> 02:01:40.260]  Hutton, I mean, I don't want to digress, but I know you talk a lot about this.
[02:01:41.901 --> 02:01:56.333]  I mean, to have a preacher in Dallas, a Presbyterian, saying that he didn't know that Jesus said, sell your cloak and buy a sword, it's hard to believe that a preacher wouldn't know that, but that cuts right to the heart of the matter of what we're facing.
[02:01:57.239 --> 02:02:02.061]  You know, I've always heard these preachers that will say, I know every word that Christ said.
[02:02:02.161 --> 02:02:06.583]  Of course, I say, you only know the words that are recorded in the Gospel.
[02:02:06.603 --> 02:02:09.324]  What did he do, walk around in silence the rest of those years?
[02:02:10.345 --> 02:02:13.626]  But anyway, that's their province.
[02:02:13.686 --> 02:02:14.766]  They're supposed to know that.
[02:02:17.087 --> 02:02:17.828]  Absolutely.
[02:02:18.568 --> 02:02:23.250]  What did you think about the listener who gave a police officer a video so he's been arrested now?
[02:02:28.333 --> 02:02:29.193]  So that's a threat.
[02:02:30.014 --> 02:02:37.738]  Well, I would suggest that everybody in the neighborhood put a real threat in this policeman's box so he knows the difference.
[02:02:39.018 --> 02:02:39.999]  And of course you're joking.
[02:02:40.019 --> 02:02:42.800]  Yeah, perhaps something even worse, like a C-SPAN video.
[02:02:42.820 --> 02:02:46.122]  That's what, uh, one of them was an evil C-SPAN video, Hutton.
[02:02:46.542 --> 02:02:46.922]  Oh, yeah.
[02:02:47.522 --> 02:02:48.343]  Well, that's bad.
[02:02:49.603 --> 02:02:52.244]  Yeah, that's even worse than an Alex Jones video.
[02:02:52.264 --> 02:02:55.266]  You know, he gave him two, a C-SPAN video and one of my videos.
[02:02:56.907 --> 02:03:00.028]  Well, he didn't have the attention span for both.
[02:03:00.928 --> 02:03:01.408]  You're funny.
[02:03:02.229 --> 02:03:04.769]  Hutton, I had you on a few weeks ago.
[02:03:04.789 --> 02:03:20.674]  We got into the New World Order and the draft and all of this, but I was captivated talking to you yesterday for 30 minutes about how the Catholic Church was taken over in 1958, or that's when one of the big takeovers took place, and I want to talk about that.
[02:03:21.414 --> 02:03:22.254]  What are the basics?
[02:03:23.962 --> 02:03:27.964]  Well, they had an election there in October to elect a new pope.
[02:03:29.184 --> 02:03:30.805]  And they did it twice, apparently.
[02:03:31.385 --> 02:03:33.546]  The white smoke came up on October 26th.
[02:03:34.227 --> 02:03:35.527]  That means we have a pope.
[02:03:36.428 --> 02:03:38.709]  And there's only one phone going in and out of the place.
[02:03:38.769 --> 02:03:42.530]  The man inside called the man outside and said, Get the guard out.
[02:03:42.570 --> 02:03:43.651]  We got a new pope for you.
[02:03:45.692 --> 02:03:48.473]  So five minutes later, the smoke turned black.
[02:03:48.533 --> 02:03:50.474]  The guy called back and said, Hey, it was a mistake.
[02:03:54.274 --> 02:03:54.734]  Mistake.
[02:03:55.014 --> 02:03:56.416]  People don't make mistakes in that.
[02:03:56.876 --> 02:04:01.840]  The people that have a job like that, you know, it's probably been in their family for generations.
[02:04:04.523 --> 02:04:06.024]  Not directly, of course.
[02:04:06.144 --> 02:04:08.466]  Probably uncle to nephew and that kind of thing.
[02:04:09.848 --> 02:04:14.692]  But here's a man whose job it is to put in some straw, wet or dry.
[02:04:16.420 --> 02:04:17.441]  And that's all he has to do.
[02:04:18.001 --> 02:04:25.667]  He's a highly intelligent man, and he's there because he can swing a lot of clout and get into the conclave, though he's not a voter.
[02:04:26.748 --> 02:04:28.769]  And he's going to make a mistake on a thing like that.
[02:04:29.049 --> 02:04:30.130]  Sure, I believe that.
[02:04:30.551 --> 02:04:31.451]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[02:04:31.771 --> 02:04:32.472]  We're going to go to break.
[02:04:32.512 --> 02:04:42.259]  I want to go back and recap this and go over the evidence and then talk about what's happened since then and how this has affected the world and the change in the Catholic Church since 1958.
[02:04:45.402 --> 02:04:50.066]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the first ever half-price package sale at the Ark Institute.

[02:07:49.157 --> 02:07:52.081]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:53.803 --> 02:07:55.445]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:07:55.485 --> 02:07:57.127]  until 2 p.m.

[02:08:00.711 --> 02:08:01.592]  We're here, folks.
[02:08:03.154 --> 02:08:04.976]  And we're talking to Hutton Gibson.
[02:08:06.610 --> 02:08:12.493]  Who really is an expert when it comes to tracking the decline of the Catholic Church.
[02:08:13.013 --> 02:08:22.738]  He's also involved in a movement that has set up, you would say, I guess, Orthodox Catholic churches around the country.
[02:08:23.393 --> 02:08:24.553]  Yeah, well, it's phony Latin, what it is.
[02:08:24.654 --> 02:08:25.254]  You remember the...
[02:08:50.188 --> 02:08:53.349]  The carborundum company that made emery wheels and things like that?
[02:08:53.749 --> 02:08:54.010]  Yes.
[02:08:54.270 --> 02:08:59.632]  Well, this one is combined with two Latin words to mean... Well, I'll give you the meaning.
[02:09:00.212 --> 02:09:03.773]  After the... Ne illegitimi carborundum.
[02:09:04.474 --> 02:09:07.175]  Which means, don't let the bastards wear you down.
[02:09:09.996 --> 02:09:10.576]  That's funny.
[02:09:10.776 --> 02:09:11.396]  Illegitimi.
[02:09:11.556 --> 02:09:13.197]  They are, you know, not legitimate.
[02:09:13.877 --> 02:09:17.919]  Yeah, they're, instead of saying bastard, illegitimate.
[02:09:17.959 --> 02:09:18.099]  Yeah.
[02:09:19.182 --> 02:09:19.802]  That's a good one.
[02:09:19.983 --> 02:09:22.384]  That's the way Latin goes.
[02:09:23.225 --> 02:09:26.627]  I've kind of modified that when I speak to the people in Rome.
[02:09:26.727 --> 02:09:30.489]  I call them the fatherless lions in Rome.
[02:09:32.092 --> 02:09:55.770]  Now, Hutton, before the break, you were getting into 1958, Pope Pius dies, they have the wet straw, they have the dry straw, and for thousands of years before, they put the straw in, and whatever color it comes out, go over that for people that don't understand it, and then let's get into the takeover of the Catholic Church.
[02:09:55.910 --> 02:10:00.594]  Well, they burn the ballots each time, so nobody knows who voted for whom after they're counted.
[02:10:01.979 --> 02:10:09.166]  And then they put them in the fire there inside the Sistine Chapel, and the smoke comes out the chimney.
[02:10:09.186 --> 02:10:14.591]  You see, they're white or black depending on whether the straw is wet or dry.
[02:10:16.233 --> 02:10:20.877]  So when it comes out white, that means we have a pope elected.
[02:10:22.118 --> 02:10:23.920]  And this 58 there on the 26th of October, it came out white.
[02:10:27.691 --> 02:10:31.832]  And went that way for five minutes, then suddenly it started getting gray, and then it turned black.
[02:10:32.632 --> 02:10:35.573]  And then they recalled the cards and said, hey, there's been a mistake.
[02:10:36.533 --> 02:10:39.094]  As I say, that's unbelievable.
[02:10:39.194 --> 02:10:41.115]  It's just not likely.
[02:10:43.255 --> 02:10:45.036]  It'd be the first time it ever happened.
[02:10:46.536 --> 02:10:53.258]  And then they come out two days later with our rotund good Pope John.
[02:10:55.158 --> 02:10:57.059]  And he wasn't eligible.
[02:10:58.806 --> 02:11:01.787]  Because to be a Pope, you have to be a Catholic.
[02:11:02.827 --> 02:11:06.208]  And he was a well-placed member in the Freemasons.
[02:11:06.848 --> 02:11:13.150]  And Freemasonry carried with it an automatic excommunication from the Church.
[02:11:14.291 --> 02:11:16.511]  So he wasn't in the Church when he was elected.
[02:11:16.811 --> 02:11:17.932]  So he wasn't eligible.
[02:11:18.572 --> 02:11:22.673]  So he came out and started making changes.
[02:11:23.033 --> 02:11:25.594]  Now, the Pope's oath of office is to the effect that
[02:11:26.604 --> 02:11:33.267]  He will take exactly what was handed him from his predecessor and hand it on absolutely without change.
[02:11:34.067 --> 02:11:39.349]  No additions, no subtractions, not even divisions to his successor.
[02:11:40.449 --> 02:11:43.490]  And these last four have done everything but.
[02:11:43.510 --> 02:11:46.912]  Of course, I don't believe they take an oath anymore.
[02:11:46.952 --> 02:11:52.694]  That's beside the point because they are now superior beings.
[02:11:52.754 --> 02:11:54.374]  They don't have to obey anybody.
[02:11:54.394 --> 02:11:55.835]  They're
[02:11:56.604 --> 02:12:05.069]  They can correct anything that was done for 1900 years, and because they have been elected there, most people look at them and say, well, yeah, well, he can do this.
[02:12:05.129 --> 02:12:05.549]  He's Pope.
[02:12:05.909 --> 02:12:07.190]  He damn well can't do this.
[02:12:08.490 --> 02:12:13.153]  But we have been infiltrated, like almost every government in the world, right from the top.
[02:12:14.318 --> 02:12:15.479]  That's the way to get them, you know?
[02:12:15.659 --> 02:12:26.626]  You get all the sheep on the bottom will just go along because this guy says he's Pope, and they don't look at the fact that he can't be Pope because he's not doing what a Pope should.
[02:12:26.966 --> 02:12:34.250]  And then now, suddenly we see the results, all the scandals in the church, people not attending, can't get priest.
[02:12:34.971 --> 02:12:36.432]  We have, at the same time...
[02:12:37.942 --> 02:12:48.568]  All over the world, more and more corruption coming out, and Catholic churches have these anti-gun doctrines, some of the other churches too.
[02:12:49.469 --> 02:12:50.349]  It's just amazing.
[02:12:51.050 --> 02:12:54.312]  Yeah, and this is not part of the program in the church.
[02:12:54.332 --> 02:12:57.173]  Nobody ever said whether or not you could carry a gun.
[02:12:57.193 --> 02:13:00.255]  It's not part of the doctrine.
[02:13:01.396 --> 02:13:03.197]  It's a matter of outside.
[02:13:04.918 --> 02:13:06.939]  The church is doctrinaire on...
[02:13:07.631 --> 02:13:09.992]  Matters of revelation.
[02:13:11.792 --> 02:13:13.813]  What is in the revelation is unchangeable.
[02:13:13.893 --> 02:13:14.653]  It's God's Word.
[02:13:16.794 --> 02:13:26.757]  But he did not say anything about whether you should join a militia, stay out of the army, whatever.
[02:13:28.017 --> 02:13:33.339]  I mean, a Christian in the early days could be a member of the Roman army.
[02:13:34.865 --> 02:13:36.826]  Could he be a member of one of the invading tribes?
[02:13:36.846 --> 02:13:38.788]  Isn't there that much difference to the church?
[02:13:41.350 --> 02:13:45.213]  Because the church's kingdom, as Christ said, is not of this world.
[02:13:46.454 --> 02:13:49.096]  And you can see that it's not of this world when you look around.
[02:13:49.637 --> 02:13:57.664]  Well, we can see what the establishment wants to do just over the furor with the attack on the Passion.
[02:13:58.324 --> 02:13:59.185]  I mean, they...
[02:14:00.387 --> 02:14:01.808]  Everything that's good is bad.
[02:14:01.868 --> 02:14:03.369]  Everything that is bad is good.
[02:14:03.389 --> 02:14:07.331]  And you can't tell the truth for fear somebody might be offended.
[02:14:10.092 --> 02:14:16.356]  You know, you tell the truth, you're not responsible for what the results are.
[02:14:16.836 --> 02:14:19.017]  It's incumbent upon you to tell the truth, right?
[02:14:20.878 --> 02:14:21.599]  Absolutely.
[02:14:21.619 --> 02:14:27.462]  I mean, look, we have all our big institutions being infiltrated, run by the same people.
[02:14:28.434 --> 02:14:31.676]  So, once they got in control in 58, what did they start doing?
[02:14:32.697 --> 02:14:33.097]  Changing.
[02:14:34.417 --> 02:14:39.360]  Our friendly John decided he would open the windows and let in some fresh air.
[02:14:40.661 --> 02:14:44.183]  So he didn't seem to realize that it was night out, and he let all the bats in.
[02:14:44.323 --> 02:14:49.026]  But they were there just waiting, ready to pounce.
[02:14:50.366 --> 02:14:53.108]  They were in the various congregations.
[02:14:53.168 --> 02:14:54.709]  They were in the various hierarchies.
[02:14:55.889 --> 02:15:04.374]  The Cardinal of Vienna, for instance, was a Freemason, which means king.
[02:15:05.534 --> 02:15:14.279]  So they had their men all through the church, the upper story, which they had told us they were going to do.
[02:15:15.219 --> 02:15:24.344]  About 1850 or 1860, there was a gentleman named, I use the word loosely, Mazzini, who was the head of the
[02:15:25.461 --> 02:15:43.552]  The United Italy thing, which stole the Papal States and put all the other little kingdoms out of business, duchies, whatever they were, and molded them all into one country, which had not been one country since the Roman Empire.
[02:15:45.753 --> 02:15:46.453]  Different peoples.
[02:15:46.473 --> 02:15:54.098]  They had Greeks down in the south, Sicily, and they had the Germans up in the northwest and on the northeast.
[02:15:55.403 --> 02:15:57.645]  And in between they had all varieties.
[02:15:58.946 --> 02:16:00.648]  They didn't even speak the same language.
[02:16:02.549 --> 02:16:17.542]  But they were nationalized, all put together in this great craze for nationhood by a bunch of Freemasons who told us at the time they were going to lead us following their flag thinking it was our own.
[02:16:18.883 --> 02:16:22.366]  And they threatened to do it, and you see the result, and then they didn't do it.
[02:16:24.284 --> 02:16:32.129]  Now, Hutton, I've talked to some of your associates, and I've read some books on this subject, specifically going back to 1958.
[02:16:32.269 --> 02:16:42.154]  Do you have any information on what happened behind the scenes or how they made them change the voting or go back and then announce a new pope?
[02:16:42.174 --> 02:16:44.256]  I mean, how did that take place?
[02:16:45.216 --> 02:16:52.741]  Well, apparently they elected somebody, and he would have been a man who was not...
[02:16:54.949 --> 02:16:56.150]  We're good to go.
[02:17:18.388 --> 02:17:22.409]  And elected somebody else without getting rid of the one they had already elected.
[02:17:22.709 --> 02:17:24.670]  Now, do we know who they had really elected?
[02:17:25.210 --> 02:17:29.891]  Well, I have a couple of pretty good guesses.
[02:17:30.491 --> 02:17:34.793]  I think it was probably Cardinal Siri from Genoa.
[02:17:35.773 --> 02:17:38.014]  Or, there's another one there.
[02:17:38.954 --> 02:17:43.535]  Yeah, I think his name is... Uh, uh, Tedeschini.
[02:17:44.776 --> 02:17:45.836]  Tedeschini, okay.
[02:17:45.856 --> 02:17:46.356]  Tedeschini.
[02:17:47.915 --> 02:17:54.419]  But they were, you might call, they would nowadays be called the right wing.
[02:17:55.539 --> 02:18:05.445]  You know, I get a lot of this nonsense that I am a member of a splitter group which has left the Catholic Church and won't recognize the Pope.
[02:18:06.266 --> 02:18:09.427]  Well, I'm just exactly what I started out like.
[02:18:10.068 --> 02:18:13.410]  So how would you describe that as an orthodox Catholic?
[02:18:13.430 --> 02:18:14.410]  I mean, how would you describe it?
[02:18:14.610 --> 02:18:17.072]  Well, I wouldn't call it a movement for one thing, but it is...
[02:18:18.038 --> 02:18:20.159]  You'd have to say traditional.
[02:18:21.099 --> 02:18:23.179]  Okay, that's the word I should use then.
[02:18:23.499 --> 02:18:25.460]  Well, then orthodox does mean traditional then.
[02:18:25.740 --> 02:18:27.220]  Yeah, well, orthodox means true.
[02:18:27.341 --> 02:18:28.241]  That's all there is to it.
[02:18:28.401 --> 02:18:34.482]  But you say orthodox and somebody mixes you up with the systematic Greek Orthodox Church or the Russian Orthodox.
[02:18:34.582 --> 02:18:38.544]  Yeah, I was just using the term orthodox to mean going back to the original.
[02:18:38.644 --> 02:18:40.804]  Yes, the true doctrine, the true teaching.
[02:18:40.844 --> 02:18:41.984]  That's exactly what it means.
[02:18:43.185 --> 02:18:43.385]  So...
[02:18:45.015 --> 02:18:49.079]  How many of these churches are there now, you know, real Catholic churches in the country?
[02:18:51.341 --> 02:18:53.463]  That's very strange.
[02:18:55.064 --> 02:19:00.068]  You have to figure there are some who are and some who are not.
[02:19:00.148 --> 02:19:07.775]  I mean, we're not all united and what you might call rebelling for the same reasons.
[02:19:08.695 --> 02:19:15.061]  So there's some groups out there that are doing it for different reasons, and I understand.
[02:19:15.081 --> 02:19:19.886]  Some of them are doing it for cash.
[02:19:21.627 --> 02:19:22.208]  I understand.
[02:19:22.388 --> 02:19:24.130]  When we get back, we'll get more into this.
[02:19:24.910 --> 02:19:32.618]  And who knows, maybe talk a little bit, but not give any secrets out about this Diane Sawyer interview coming up tonight on Primetime.
[02:19:33.880 --> 02:19:36.162]  She's a CFR member, so I don't trust her very much.
[02:19:36.222 --> 02:19:38.664]  But it's all coming up, folks, with Hutton Gibson.
[02:19:38.684 --> 02:19:42.847]  We're going to talk more about the transformation of the Catholic Church.
[02:19:45.532 --> 02:19:49.433]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:19:49.654 --> 02:20:01.938]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:20:02.358 --> 02:20:02.758]  The U.S.
[02:20:02.798 --> 02:20:08.400]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:20:08.781 --> 02:20:11.001]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:20:12.862 --> 02:20:13.342]  We're good to go.
[02:20:33.710 --> 02:20:37.712]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[02:20:37.832 --> 02:20:38.172]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:38.292 --> 02:20:39.993]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:40.013 --> 02:20:47.436]  You hear a lot about the quality of air outside these days.
[02:20:47.496 --> 02:20:47.996]  Pollution.
[02:20:48.056 --> 02:20:48.296]  Pollen.
[02:20:48.356 --> 02:20:49.477]  Is it as healthy as you'd like it?
[02:20:49.537 --> 02:20:49.957]  Allergies.
[02:20:50.057 --> 02:20:50.377]  Asthma.
[02:20:50.417 --> 02:20:50.837]  Probably not.
[02:20:50.857 --> 02:20:51.858]  Well, listen to this.
[02:20:52.078 --> 02:21:01.061]  Did you know, according to the American Lung Association, combined with the EPA, the air quality inside your home is actually 6 to 10 times worse than the air outside?
[02:21:01.081 --> 02:21:01.962]  6 to 10 times.
[02:21:02.002 --> 02:21:02.502]  How could that be?
[02:21:07.739 --> 02:21:09.342]  What about all those cleaners under your sink?
[02:21:09.803 --> 02:21:11.345]  Where do you think all those fumes go?
[02:21:14.612 --> 02:21:14.892]  Go.
[02:21:15.032 --> 02:21:15.553]  Into you.
[02:21:15.793 --> 02:21:16.573]  Into your children.
[02:21:16.593 --> 02:21:17.173]  Their lungs.
[02:21:17.273 --> 02:21:18.054]  Am I scaring you?
[02:21:18.374 --> 02:21:19.274]  Remember this word.
[02:21:19.674 --> 02:21:20.415]  Puritech.
[02:21:20.435 --> 02:21:21.975]  P-U-R-I-T-E-C.
[02:21:22.035 --> 02:21:24.216]  Puritech makes the Pure Air System.
[02:21:24.396 --> 02:21:36.942]  What this air cleaning system does is remove dangerous airborne particles like smoke, odors, VOCs, allergens, fine dust, mold, pollen, and kills bacteria for less than half the cost of other air purifiers, which do a lot less.
[02:21:37.022 --> 02:21:38.303]  Call them now to breathe easier.
[02:21:38.323 --> 02:21:38.383]  888-491-4100.
[02:21:38.423 --> 02:21:39.443]  The Puritech Pure Air System.
[02:21:39.563 --> 02:21:40.263]  Online at Puritech.com.
[02:21:43.985 --> 02:21:44.465]  We're good to go.
[02:21:44.485 --> 02:21:45.126]  We're good to go.
[02:22:13.789 --> 02:22:18.592]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:22:18.812 --> 02:22:24.236]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:22:24.556 --> 02:22:27.638]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:22:27.979 --> 02:22:35.944]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:22:35.984 --> 02:22:36.544]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.

[02:23:30.876 --> 02:23:33.960]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:23:34.120 --> 02:23:39.987]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:23:45.609 --> 02:23:49.551]  We're good to go.
[02:24:15.902 --> 02:24:22.644]  About Jesus Christ, and it's attacked, it's demonized, but it has blown up in their face.
[02:24:22.704 --> 02:24:30.326]  But I did want to bring up one issue, and I'm not going to talk about it on air because I don't want to steal Mel Gibson's thunder.
[02:24:30.427 --> 02:24:32.827]  You know, he told Hutton this with no intention of it going on the air.
[02:24:33.307 --> 02:24:42.590]  But tomorrow we will talk about it if it's not in the primetime live this evening, 10 o'clock Eastern, 9 o'clock Central.
[02:24:43.090 --> 02:24:44.031]  I'm going to be watching it.
[02:24:44.051 --> 02:24:44.891]  I hope you watch it.
[02:24:47.375 --> 02:24:52.276]  And it concerns some of the statements that Mel made that are very powerful and also funny.
[02:24:53.016 --> 02:25:00.538]  And we'll just see if CFR member Diane Sawyer, New World Order propagandist, puts these clips in there.
[02:25:01.038 --> 02:25:06.920]  I'm looking at an ABC News synopsis of the interview coming up tonight, and it's on InfoWars.com.
[02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:09.941]  I see none of the quotes I was told in there.
[02:25:12.077 --> 02:25:19.259]  Hutton, it'll be interesting to see if out of a three-plus-hour interview that's condensed down to 30 minutes, these quotes are in there.
[02:25:19.299 --> 02:25:21.980]  Well, something's got to give, you know.
[02:25:22.180 --> 02:25:23.100]  Very likely they won't.
[02:25:25.821 --> 02:25:30.563]  Well, I'm putting my bets on that the quotes you told me that Mel told you will not be in there.
[02:25:31.183 --> 02:25:34.944]  Well, that's the same.
[02:25:35.044 --> 02:25:36.344]  So we'll have to wait and see.
[02:25:37.224 --> 02:25:38.765]  But I hope we're both proven wrong.
[02:25:41.884 --> 02:25:43.646]  All right, folks, we'll let you know tomorrow.
[02:25:44.868 --> 02:25:47.791]  Either way, it's okay to talk about it tomorrow if it's not on there, right, Hutton?
[02:25:48.352 --> 02:25:49.774]  Yeah, well, one of them anyway.
[02:25:51.876 --> 02:25:52.217]  Okay.
[02:25:52.577 --> 02:25:57.243]  All right, well, listen, I mean, you got my interest piqued from what you told me yesterday.
[02:25:57.263 --> 02:25:57.924]  That was interesting.
[02:25:58.484 --> 02:26:01.168]  Now folks will definitely be tuned in to see what happens.
[02:26:01.804 --> 02:26:06.206]  But, Hutton, the changes, specifically in the Catholic Church.
[02:26:06.266 --> 02:26:10.769]  I mean, you said that you started noticing it in the 60s as well, or even the late 50s.
[02:26:11.029 --> 02:26:15.171]  How fast, after the Masons took over the Catholic Church, did you see the shift?
[02:26:16.412 --> 02:26:19.193]  Well, it started very quickly.
[02:26:19.213 --> 02:26:21.395]  We were loosened up.
[02:26:21.655 --> 02:26:29.459]  You know, things became moot questions, and as I say, the man was going to open the windows with the council.
[02:26:30.407 --> 02:26:38.469]  What he was doing was getting all the bishops into Rome at one time so he could share the responsibility for the changes he was going to bring in.
[02:26:42.089 --> 02:26:44.130]  He did cut one thing through.
[02:26:44.630 --> 02:26:48.791]  He let the council revolt on him in the first place.
[02:26:48.871 --> 02:26:51.071]  He should have packed it up and sent it home.
[02:26:57.256 --> 02:27:01.839]  They refused to take the documents which were all prepared for their consideration.
[02:27:01.859 --> 02:27:03.720]  Their agenda was missing.
[02:27:04.460 --> 02:27:06.881]  They just voted it out, 60 to 40.
[02:27:07.121 --> 02:27:12.284]  Now, to get through, it should have gone 67 to 33.
[02:27:14.886 --> 02:27:21.069]  Two-thirds was required, but he went along with it, you know, rather than pack it up and send it home because he would...
[02:27:21.784 --> 02:27:24.385]  His niche in history would be filled with snickers.
[02:27:24.625 --> 02:27:33.510]  So basically they drove a wedge in, started balkanizing automatically in the name of, quote, power sharing to get others involved in the breakup.
[02:27:33.950 --> 02:27:34.330]  That's it.
[02:27:34.350 --> 02:27:37.692]  He wanted all the bishops in to approve what he was going to do.
[02:27:38.552 --> 02:27:45.755]  And then he died on them after the first one went through, which was sitting there just waiting to be taken up.
[02:27:45.876 --> 02:27:48.057]  It was the only thing ready to be considered.
[02:27:48.537 --> 02:27:50.278]  So they went through it and went...
[02:27:51.781 --> 02:27:56.103]  It's the constitution on the sacred liturgy, and it's nonsense from beginning to end.
[02:27:57.584 --> 02:28:01.966]  But one thing it did not order was a new rite of mass.
[02:28:03.187 --> 02:28:08.089]  But Paul VI, when he put in the new rite, said that he was obeying the council in this.
[02:28:08.109 --> 02:28:11.371]  Well, in the first place, the pope doesn't have to obey a council.
[02:28:11.391 --> 02:28:16.794]  The council's edicts are of no use until they're signed by a pope, acting as pope.
[02:28:18.095 --> 02:28:20.556]  And Paul VI signed all these documents.
[02:28:22.545 --> 02:28:23.425]  Full of changes.
[02:28:24.886 --> 02:28:34.413]  But the changes in the Council, there were 12 specific heresies outside of that first document, which I say was solid heresy.
[02:28:35.013 --> 02:28:43.339]  But from there on, there was at least 12 specific heresies which I've insulated, isolated, and treated in one of my books.
[02:28:43.359 --> 02:28:44.520]  It's the Pope Catholic.
[02:28:45.500 --> 02:28:48.502]  And they said, among other things, that
[02:28:51.080 --> 02:28:55.424]  Christ completed his revelation with his death on the cross.
[02:28:56.945 --> 02:29:00.688]  So, you know, without the resurrection, as St.
[02:29:00.868 --> 02:29:02.089]  Paul says, we're all cooked.
[02:29:04.251 --> 02:29:18.642]  So he's leaving out a lot of things there that he did not have revealed and were not part of the revelation, including the descent of the Holy Ghost and the apostles going out and preaching one thing and another.
[02:29:20.796 --> 02:29:29.940]  Tell you what, stay there.
[02:29:29.980 --> 02:29:30.601]  We've got a break.
[02:29:30.621 --> 02:29:31.461]  We'll come back with this.
[02:29:31.481 --> 02:29:32.502]  This is very important.
[02:29:32.522 --> 02:29:33.042]  Stay with us.
[02:29:35.623 --> 02:29:36.543]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.004 --> 02:29:38.604]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:39.525 --> 02:29:42.206]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:45.718 --> 02:29:49.599]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:29:49.839 --> 02:29:55.281]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:29:55.561 --> 02:30:05.905]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:30:06.085 --> 02:30:10.426]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:30:10.626 --> 02:30:18.968]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:30:19.248 --> 02:30:25.610]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[02:30:25.710 --> 02:30:30.191]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave them the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:30:30.411 --> 02:30:34.633]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[02:30:48.952 --> 02:30:49.672]  You heard that right.
[02:30:49.753 --> 02:30:52.214]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[02:30:52.374 --> 02:30:53.315]  You don't have to pay them off.
[02:30:53.575 --> 02:30:54.835]  The banks are defrauding you.
[02:30:55.136 --> 02:30:56.636]  Now is the time to fight back.
[02:30:56.917 --> 02:30:59.618]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.

[02:31:53.576 --> 02:31:57.799]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:31:58.040 --> 02:32:05.085]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:32:05.466 --> 02:32:11.571]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:32:11.711 --> 02:32:12.932]  There are no side effects.
[02:32:13.112 --> 02:32:13.572]  We're good to go.

[02:32:34.925 --> 02:32:35.826]  Call today.
[02:32:35.866 --> 02:32:37.988]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:32:38.048 --> 02:32:40.430]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:32:40.470 --> 02:32:41.931]  Take the National Rifle Association.
[02:33:00.103 --> 02:33:02.545]  Decades ago, it was pro-gun.
[02:33:03.406 --> 02:33:07.689]  Today, its job is disarming the American people.
[02:33:08.310 --> 02:33:13.374]  They go into federal courts, they botch cases, they go after groups that are really pro-gun.
[02:33:14.315 --> 02:33:20.420]  They're there to neutralize the five-plus million members to pacify them.
[02:33:21.221 --> 02:33:22.422]  They've been overtaken.
[02:33:23.481 --> 02:33:28.942]  The Baptist churches, a lot of them are pro-New World Order, anti-gun, anti-family.
[02:33:29.982 --> 02:33:31.202]  It's happened to the Methodists.
[02:33:31.443 --> 02:33:33.163]  It's happened to the Episcopalian.
[02:33:33.643 --> 02:33:36.043]  I mean, you see these articles all the time.
[02:33:37.944 --> 02:33:39.364]  You've seen it in your own church.
[02:33:40.224 --> 02:33:49.386]  And this is what the elite is good at, is going in and taking over organizations, institutions, and clearly that's what happened with the Catholic Church after 1958.
[02:33:51.287 --> 02:33:59.288]  And, Hutton, you're telling me they went in and changed the basic doctrine down to saying that Christ hadn't done his work?
[02:33:59.969 --> 02:34:01.249]  That's the idea, yes.
[02:34:01.369 --> 02:34:04.269]  He left us an incomplete revelation.
[02:34:04.289 --> 02:34:15.371]  In one document there, The Church in the Modern World, Gaudium et Spes, they call it, from its first three words, that we are joined with the rest of men in the search for truth.
[02:34:15.871 --> 02:34:16.691]  Search for truth.
[02:34:17.992 --> 02:34:20.132]  When we are supposedly...
[02:34:21.761 --> 02:34:24.142]  The vehicle for proclaiming the truth.
[02:34:25.383 --> 02:34:28.864]  Why would we be searching for it when it was given to us?
[02:34:28.884 --> 02:34:31.286]  It's revealed truth that we're talking about.
[02:34:31.746 --> 02:34:34.707]  Now, at the same time, you're in the United States.
[02:34:34.847 --> 02:34:38.069]  You start seeing the change in the Catholic Church.
[02:34:38.109 --> 02:34:40.830]  What were those changes that you saw on the ground?
[02:34:41.591 --> 02:34:48.714]  Well, they started off with vernacularizing.
[02:34:49.504 --> 02:34:52.125]  Everything has to be put in the local language.
[02:34:53.526 --> 02:34:59.088]  And then they put in a table there instead of an altar and have the priest face the congregation.
[02:35:00.368 --> 02:35:05.950]  And then you have people saying, oh, I like this better because now I can understand what he's saying.
[02:35:05.970 --> 02:35:09.312]  I couldn't understand what he was saying when he was talking Latin.
[02:35:09.932 --> 02:35:12.273]  The obvious answer is, well, he wasn't talking to you.
[02:35:12.293 --> 02:35:14.173]  And then they...
[02:35:19.372 --> 02:35:24.817]  Translations themselves, there were plenty available, but they put out new ones, and they were wretched.
[02:35:25.655 --> 02:35:29.277]  And everybody could look at him and say, my kid could do better, because he could.
[02:35:29.737 --> 02:35:45.184]  So basically, we've seen the same thing with the Protestant churches, all these hundreds and hundreds of new Bibles that come out, where suddenly Jesus supports homosexuality, suddenly Jesus loves abortion, suddenly Jesus loves gun control.
[02:35:45.745 --> 02:35:49.467]  I mean, I don't know, Hutton, have you seen some of these new Bibles that are out there?
[02:35:50.027 --> 02:35:52.328]  But it's like Anton LaVey wrote them or something.
[02:35:54.292 --> 02:35:57.494]  I kind of gave up on them after that Good News for Modern Man came out.
[02:35:57.554 --> 02:36:01.556]  I've got that and the Jerusalem Bible and about five or six other Bibles.
[02:36:02.056 --> 02:36:06.099]  But it's a waste of time going now.
[02:36:06.699 --> 02:36:12.022]  One of the reasons they put out new ones all the time is so they don't have to pay copyright.
[02:36:15.044 --> 02:36:21.367]  It's a weird situation so that if you're going to look up a quotation, you have to
[02:36:22.103 --> 02:36:22.644]  It's amazing.
[02:36:22.684 --> 02:36:23.965]  What other changes did you see?
[02:36:24.005 --> 02:36:29.008]  Well, they eventually vitiated all the sacraments.
[02:36:29.068 --> 02:36:29.149]  The
[02:36:51.601 --> 02:36:58.524]  They put in a new rite of mass, which is way out of their competence, as I say.
[02:36:58.564 --> 02:37:00.305]  They've got to pass on what was given to them.
[02:37:00.946 --> 02:37:07.489]  And not only that, but then, as they put the new one in, they made the old one redundant, you might say.
[02:37:07.529 --> 02:37:08.489]  They forbade it.
[02:37:08.789 --> 02:37:09.650]  Not officially.
[02:37:09.890 --> 02:37:11.771]  No one can find where they did it.
[02:37:12.951 --> 02:37:14.252]  But they did it just the same.
[02:37:15.353 --> 02:37:20.215]  And it was by order of the various bishops who were in on this,
[02:37:20.956 --> 02:37:25.923]  Well, the bishops' conferences, they decided a date on which this new rite would be mandatory.
[02:37:25.943 --> 02:37:31.191]  And you better not do the old one, in spite of the fact that, according to the law of the Church,
[02:37:31.741 --> 02:37:34.463]  The old man was privileged, and nobody could be forbidden.
[02:37:35.003 --> 02:37:38.385]  And we've seen this not just with the Catholic Church, but the Constitution.
[02:37:39.246 --> 02:37:41.608]  The textbooks don't quote the actual text.
[02:37:41.728 --> 02:37:53.836]  They tell you what it said, and we see this with other organizations, and now the world is upside down, where what you have is goodness is evil, and evil is good, is what they tell us.
[02:37:54.196 --> 02:38:00.420]  Yeah, and we even have a pope coming out this past New Year's and talking about how the New World Order is what we want.
[02:38:02.330 --> 02:38:04.632]  I know, that was on CNN Live.
[02:38:04.652 --> 02:38:06.114]  I even have it.
[02:38:06.634 --> 02:38:13.261]  And when I talked about it on Air Hutton, I got emails saying I was a liar, that the Pope wouldn't do something like that.
[02:38:13.421 --> 02:38:15.463]  Well, hell, Paul VI did something like that in 1965.
[02:38:15.523 --> 02:38:20.007]  He went to the United Nations and called them the last hope of the world.
[02:38:25.072 --> 02:38:26.854]  How did the world get along without it?
[02:38:27.984 --> 02:38:28.725]  All those centuries.
[02:38:29.005 --> 02:38:36.674]  Well, I want to know how people deny that the current pope said we need a new world order when he said it on international television.
[02:38:36.955 --> 02:38:39.418]  Yeah, I've got it here in writing.
[02:38:42.982 --> 02:38:43.903]  That was on CNN.
[02:38:43.943 --> 02:38:45.384]  Yeah, I've got the CNN article and...
[02:38:46.781 --> 02:38:47.662]  Well, I'll tell you.
[02:38:48.242 --> 02:38:54.325]  So what did you try to do to insulate your family from this apostate, counterfeit church?
[02:38:54.726 --> 02:39:02.310]  Well, the first thing I had to do was take them out of the schools, out of the Catholic schools, because they were being fed nonsense there.
[02:39:02.990 --> 02:39:06.492]  And they brought me what they were getting in school.
[02:39:07.113 --> 02:39:11.355]  I wrote long paper, 14-inch pages, types,
[02:39:13.749 --> 02:39:20.936]  Well, I sent eight pages of it to the local Cardinal Archbishop of Sydney there, a nun scull by the name of James Freeman.
[02:39:22.998 --> 02:39:23.979]  I shouldn't call him that.
[02:39:24.119 --> 02:39:27.282]  The poor fellow can't help it, he's a nun scull.
[02:39:27.743 --> 02:39:30.325]  But he's dead now, so I guess he won't get me.
[02:39:31.947 --> 02:39:36.611]  Anyway, what did I get back from him?
[02:39:38.672 --> 02:39:42.573]  We're not here to ram religion down your children's throats.
[02:39:42.753 --> 02:39:43.133]  Oh, no?
[02:39:43.213 --> 02:39:45.734]  What do you think we send them to that school for?
[02:39:46.214 --> 02:39:46.915]  Exactly.
[02:39:47.095 --> 02:39:52.777]  So you put your child in a Christian school, a Catholic school, and then they go, we're not going to teach that anymore.
[02:39:52.977 --> 02:40:03.620]  No, they had such nonsense as that Christ was going along in blind trust in his Father, and he wound up on the cross wondering how he got there.
[02:40:05.012 --> 02:40:06.732]  So what was he talking about at the last supper?
[02:40:07.252 --> 02:40:15.254]  Well, I mean, that's obviously a satanic doctrine that Jesus just didn't know what he was doing and had blind trust and wound up on the cross.
[02:40:15.454 --> 02:40:16.154]  Yeah.
[02:40:16.194 --> 02:40:20.315]  That tells you what to do with your blind trust in God, doesn't it?
[02:40:20.335 --> 02:40:23.116]  I tell you, I mean, that sounds like something that a Satanist would write.
[02:40:24.316 --> 02:40:24.916]  Well, they were.
[02:40:25.516 --> 02:40:28.177]  They had a bunch of apostates.
[02:40:28.477 --> 02:40:33.058]  They were supposedly clergy, but we had clergy planted on us by the communists for...
[02:40:34.975 --> 02:40:35.815]  Since the 30s.
[02:40:37.576 --> 02:40:38.316]  As they will tell you.
[02:40:38.696 --> 02:40:41.637]  So basically the takeover was already taking place before 1958.
[02:40:41.817 --> 02:40:42.057]  Yes.
[02:40:42.157 --> 02:40:46.779]  It didn't spring all to life in one moment.
[02:40:47.239 --> 02:40:49.680]  They were in the veins, you might say.
[02:40:50.020 --> 02:40:54.942]  So at the lower and mid-levels it was already going on, and then finally they took over the central system.
[02:40:55.322 --> 02:40:55.482]  Yes.
[02:40:56.690 --> 02:41:06.678]  Well, I mean, I've read the writings and the statements of the Catholic Church before 58, and it's very conservative, anti-world government, and then after that it becomes pro-New World Order.
[02:41:06.918 --> 02:41:08.800]  You really can see the total shift.
[02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:11.762]  Yeah, and you can even see it in the verbiage.
[02:41:11.802 --> 02:41:14.344]  There's nothing clearer than the statement of Catholic doctrine.
[02:41:14.984 --> 02:41:18.567]  But you read the documents of Vatican II, and you have to fight your way through the fog.
[02:41:20.749 --> 02:41:25.473]  Hutton, before we run out of time, I've had you on many times, and never...
[02:41:26.221 --> 02:41:33.603]  promoted the fact that you've written four books, and I've got a video you made, and I've got your newsletter, but I haven't got one of these books.
[02:41:33.683 --> 02:41:34.444]  I would love one.
[02:41:35.704 --> 02:41:41.126]  You told me during a break that Is the Pope Catholic is one of your best books.
[02:41:41.406 --> 02:41:42.666]  How do folks get a copy of that?
[02:41:45.027 --> 02:41:52.090]  Well, I know you just moved, but it's...
[02:41:53.837 --> 02:41:57.158]  And Hutton, speak up for us a little bit because we're having to boost your audio.
[02:41:58.018 --> 02:41:59.499]  Give us that address, please.
[02:41:59.519 --> 02:42:01.279]  141 Irish Street.
[02:42:03.840 --> 02:42:09.542]  Summersville, West Virginia.
[02:42:09.562 --> 02:42:09.542]  26651.
[02:42:10.182 --> 02:42:14.723]  Now again, folks, I'm going to get 50 calls once I'm off air asking for this address.
[02:42:14.863 --> 02:42:15.783]  Write it down now.
[02:42:16.224 --> 02:42:17.084]  Here it is again.
[02:42:17.504 --> 02:42:18.764]  One more time for folks, Hutton.
[02:42:18.784 --> 02:42:19.585]  141 Irish Street.
[02:42:23.030 --> 02:42:24.710]  Summersville, West Virginia.
[02:42:25.931 --> 02:42:28.211]  That's S-U-M-M-E-R-S-B-I-L-L-E 26651.
[02:42:29.292 --> 02:42:34.433]  And how much is it for the book?
[02:42:34.953 --> 02:42:36.874]  $10 for the Pope Catholic.
[02:42:38.454 --> 02:42:40.895]  It's $10 also for The Enemy Is Here.
[02:42:41.475 --> 02:42:41.975]  Still here.
[02:42:42.475 --> 02:42:50.497]  I don't have enough copies of The Enemy Is Here, which can be gotten from Omnibook at Palmdale, California.
[02:42:51.929 --> 02:43:00.055]  Box 900566, Palmdale 93590, California.
[02:43:00.075 --> 02:43:02.617]  So you've written four books.
[02:43:02.637 --> 02:43:04.339]  You've written, Is the Pope Catholic?
[02:43:04.879 --> 02:43:05.900]  The Enemy is Here.
[02:43:05.980 --> 02:43:07.221]  The Enemy is Still Here.
[02:43:07.281 --> 02:43:08.622]  And what's your fourth book?
[02:43:08.642 --> 02:43:09.583]  Time Out of Mind.
[02:43:09.663 --> 02:43:16.949]  That's a kind of a shortened form, a conversational form of, Is the Pope Catholic?
[02:43:17.549 --> 02:43:19.130]  It has none of the documentation.
[02:43:19.230 --> 02:43:19.551]  It's just...
[02:43:20.282 --> 02:43:22.946]  In a conversational style, almost a catechism.
[02:43:23.426 --> 02:43:25.889]  Question and answer, argument.
[02:43:26.550 --> 02:43:30.155]  And I've been accused of making some of these arguments up.
[02:43:30.896 --> 02:43:32.438]  But honestly, I'm not that stupid.
[02:43:35.221 --> 02:43:38.606]  You wouldn't believe some of the things I've heard from priests or have written to me.
[02:43:40.077 --> 02:43:42.199]  And they are just ridiculous.
[02:43:42.579 --> 02:43:55.630]  Well, it's like that preacher I had on in the first hour, Hutton, saying on air that he'd never heard of Luke 22, 36, where Christ said, sell your garments and go buy swords.
[02:43:56.050 --> 02:43:56.250]  Yeah.
[02:43:58.012 --> 02:43:59.053]  Even I've heard of that one.
[02:44:03.096 --> 02:44:06.739]  And Catholics, you know, we're not supposed to be great Bible readers.
[02:44:07.628 --> 02:44:10.889]  Well, what we are is, we're not great readers of the Old Testament.
[02:44:11.969 --> 02:44:18.931]  Because the idea behind that is, why bother with the foreshadow when you have the substance?
[02:44:19.971 --> 02:44:20.991]  Which is the New Testament.
[02:44:22.332 --> 02:44:22.992]  Absolutely.
[02:44:23.012 --> 02:44:27.993]  Well, again, before we end the show, we'll give that address out one more time.
[02:44:28.033 --> 02:44:29.153]  But is the Pope Catholic?
[02:44:29.173 --> 02:44:31.114]  You also have your newsletter, which is excellent.
[02:44:31.554 --> 02:44:34.075]  Yeah, the war is now.
[02:44:34.335 --> 02:44:35.195]  I'm working on number 61.
[02:44:37.188 --> 02:44:38.929]  I'll tell you, you come up with the best names.
[02:44:38.989 --> 02:44:44.773]  The war is now, is the Pope Catholic, the enemy is here, the enemy is still here.
[02:44:46.894 --> 02:44:53.819]  That refers to the fact that on the cover of both those books is a map of Italy, and here is right opposite Rome.
[02:44:56.720 --> 02:45:03.625]  So, as I say, we've been taken over, and nobody looks at the results.
[02:45:04.972 --> 02:45:09.294]  And looks at where they get the competence to do the things they've done.
[02:45:10.955 --> 02:45:13.456]  The church is just unrecognizable.
[02:45:14.276 --> 02:45:16.657]  A lot of people have left it, and who can blame them?
[02:45:19.498 --> 02:45:29.262]  Most people don't seem to get to that point where they can see the thing and say, this idiot cannot be Pope.
[02:45:29.723 --> 02:45:30.363]  Ha ha ha ha!
[02:45:32.116 --> 02:45:34.937]  He says this and he says that, and what did St.
[02:45:34.977 --> 02:45:35.698]  John say?
[02:45:35.818 --> 02:45:36.618]  What did St.
[02:45:36.658 --> 02:45:37.278]  Luke say?
[02:45:37.618 --> 02:45:38.719]  What did Christ say?
[02:45:41.040 --> 02:45:46.402]  So it's contradicting the gospel, but again, people don't go to the source documents to check it out.
[02:45:46.442 --> 02:45:50.664]  They just say, well, this guy's wearing a big hat, so he must have the authority.
[02:45:50.904 --> 02:45:55.487]  Yeah, well, there's this quotation that they all use.
[02:45:57.607 --> 02:46:00.929]  Behold, I am with you all days, even at the consummation of the world.
[02:46:01.380 --> 02:46:04.262]  But they don't leave the whole phrase in.
[02:46:04.443 --> 02:46:09.266]  It starts off with, Going therefore teach ye all nations, and I am with you all days.
[02:46:09.727 --> 02:46:10.568]  For that purpose.
[02:46:10.668 --> 02:46:14.851]  Now they have, since Vatican II, they have quit the missionary effort.
[02:46:15.031 --> 02:46:16.733]  The church is no longer apostolic.
[02:46:17.473 --> 02:46:18.994]  It does not go out and make converts.
[02:46:19.595 --> 02:46:21.957]  It says we'll negotiate with religions.
[02:46:22.557 --> 02:46:23.718]  A religion has no soul.
[02:46:23.758 --> 02:46:24.639]  You can't convert it.
[02:46:24.719 --> 02:46:25.880]  It won't go to heaven or hell.
[02:46:26.741 --> 02:46:28.262]  You work on the individuals.
[02:46:29.707 --> 02:46:30.548]  That's the only way.
[02:46:30.808 --> 02:46:31.688]  That's what Christ said.
[02:46:31.708 --> 02:46:40.833]  Well, basically, by conversing with other religions, the current popes come out and said that all religions are one, and we need this world religion.
[02:46:41.434 --> 02:46:52.440]  Basically, the Catholic Church, or what they call the Catholic Church, this abomination there in Rome, is saying we're going to merge with all these other religions.
[02:46:52.720 --> 02:46:54.962]  That's the idea, and that's part of the plot.
[02:46:55.022 --> 02:46:57.163]  We have to have a world government, don't we?
[02:46:58.149 --> 02:46:59.529]  So we have to have a world religion.
[02:47:01.350 --> 02:47:02.830]  Hutton, how can people deny?
[02:47:02.950 --> 02:47:05.711]  I mean, the Supreme Court says they follow the orders of the UN.
[02:47:06.231 --> 02:47:08.512]  They're announcing the New World Order on a daily basis.
[02:47:09.352 --> 02:47:14.133]  But then the FBI training manuals say anybody that talks about it is a raving lunatic.
[02:47:14.413 --> 02:47:15.313]  It doesn't exist.
[02:47:15.553 --> 02:47:16.233]  Of course not.
[02:47:16.313 --> 02:47:18.714]  As soon as you say conspiracy, you're nuts.
[02:47:20.354 --> 02:47:23.075]  There's an awful lot of nuts around.
[02:47:24.055 --> 02:47:25.676]  People are catching on to this stuff.
[02:47:26.176 --> 02:47:26.996]  Unfortunately...
[02:47:28.123 --> 02:47:30.324]  They don't seem to be the ones that are going to church.
[02:47:33.344 --> 02:47:39.586]  Well, a lot of people just go to church and they want to feel good, and the preacher wants to make them feel good, and they just tell them to go along with all this.
[02:47:39.626 --> 02:47:45.867]  It's like Pat Robertson saying that, well, China's doing what it has to do with forced abortion and infanticide.
[02:47:45.887 --> 02:47:47.768]  He said that on CNN.
[02:47:48.148 --> 02:47:52.809]  He posted it on his website, and people get mad at me every time I say he said that.
[02:47:59.457 --> 02:48:14.925]  Well, I have to tell you, Hutton, getting a chance to meet you and some of your children and grandchildren and your wonderful wife, Joy, I mean, it's good to know that there are great folks like you out there here in the United States that have been getting the truth out for so long.
[02:48:15.065 --> 02:48:21.148]  And for anybody that doubts that one person can have an effect and change people's minds,
[02:48:21.528 --> 02:48:22.549]  You've written four books.
[02:48:22.589 --> 02:48:23.790]  You've given hundreds of speeches.
[02:48:23.810 --> 02:48:25.331]  You've done a lot of radio interviews.
[02:48:26.512 --> 02:48:28.854]  Through your children, you have done so much as well.
[02:48:28.914 --> 02:48:33.357]  I mean, look at your son, Mel, and all these great films he's made and the passion coming out.
[02:48:34.118 --> 02:48:39.662]  I mean, to everybody out there, shame on you if you don't take action like Hutton, Gibson, and others have.
[02:48:44.105 --> 02:48:45.406]  I'm going to get a lot of hate mail in.
[02:48:45.426 --> 02:48:46.227]  So, uh,
[02:48:51.425 --> 02:48:55.686]  Anyway, they have changed, and they continue to change.
[02:48:56.206 --> 02:48:59.307]  Every time you turn around, there's still another change.
[02:49:00.108 --> 02:49:04.489]  And they were introduced in the first place like, well, now this is the last change.
[02:49:05.209 --> 02:49:07.410]  And two weeks later, in comes another one.
[02:49:07.430 --> 02:49:09.770]  Everything was done step by step and gradually.
[02:49:09.790 --> 02:49:14.032]  They involved people in the services and the masks.
[02:49:14.512 --> 02:49:17.533]  Well, it isn't a mask, of course, but they claim it is.
[02:49:17.593 --> 02:49:18.353]  They call it that.
[02:49:18.973 --> 02:49:26.378]  Well, they'd get people in to read the various lessons and things that were always read by the priests.
[02:49:26.718 --> 02:49:33.682]  So once they started changing things, it was just a pell-mell orgy of throwing out the old, bringing in Bedlam.
[02:49:34.083 --> 02:49:35.223]  Oh, yeah.
[02:49:35.323 --> 02:49:37.125]  Innovation is where it was at, you know.
[02:49:37.405 --> 02:49:39.146]  You get ahead by thinking up things.
[02:49:40.565 --> 02:49:44.066]  They didn't want anybody around that wanted to keep what he had.
[02:49:44.326 --> 02:49:48.106]  And now look at the Catholic Church today, or the abomination.
[02:49:48.927 --> 02:49:52.707]  It is falling apart, and do the people running it change course?
[02:49:53.047 --> 02:49:56.508]  No, they accelerate, because I guess they want it to fall apart.
[02:49:56.648 --> 02:49:57.528]  Well, that's part of it.
[02:49:57.688 --> 02:50:01.989]  Another thing, those that may be sincere think, well, we have to try something more.
[02:50:02.009 --> 02:50:06.890]  It would be terrible if they turned around and went back to what worked for 19th century.
[02:50:09.597 --> 02:50:10.317]  It's incredible.
[02:50:10.437 --> 02:50:15.739]  Well... Of course, they've gotten to the point where there's no clergy around anymore to do it.
[02:50:17.239 --> 02:50:20.080]  Because they did change the sacrament of holy orders while they were at it.
[02:50:20.700 --> 02:50:33.043]  Same day they put in a new mass, they put in a new set of holy orders, and we haven't had a priest properly ordained or a bishop properly consecrated in the Latin Rite that was in communication with Rome.
[02:50:33.823 --> 02:50:37.624]  You might find some in China or Ukraine, someplace where the
[02:50:38.502 --> 02:50:39.965]  The Iron Curtain got in the way.
[02:50:40.286 --> 02:50:41.288]  Tell you what, we got a break.
[02:50:41.308 --> 02:50:44.175]  We'll be right back with the final segment.
[02:50:45.643 --> 02:50:54.272]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:50:54.492 --> 02:51:05.763]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:51:05.983 --> 02:51:08.626]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:51:08.966 --> 02:51:15.428]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:51:15.588 --> 02:51:17.449]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:51:17.649 --> 02:51:23.671]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:51:23.931 --> 02:51:29.593]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:51:29.913 --> 02:51:38.415]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:51:42.796 --> 02:51:44.096]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:51:45.536 --> 02:51:49.877]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:51:50.077 --> 02:51:54.398]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:51:56.929 --> 02:51:59.030]  This disaster is a new world order.
[02:51:59.110 --> 02:52:01.892]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:52:02.192 --> 02:52:06.414]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:52:06.474 --> 02:52:13.398]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:52:13.538 --> 02:52:15.539]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:52:15.939 --> 02:52:26.247]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:52:26.527 --> 02:52:31.891]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:52:36.195 --> 02:52:37.476]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:52:44.921 --> 02:52:49.305]  This is Joyce Riley, and most of you know I've searched for over five years to find something to help the vets.
[02:52:49.666 --> 02:52:51.547]  Well, I've found something that will help everybody.
[02:52:51.948 --> 02:52:57.733]  Miracle-2 soap, neutralizer gel, and skin moisturizer have prompted testimonies from people all over the country.
[02:52:58.214 --> 02:53:02.738]  Around the house, it's gentle enough to wash your hair, strong enough for your toughest jobs.
[02:53:03.158 --> 02:53:05.861]  In a garden, it controls pests and can increase your yield 200%.
[02:53:07.563 --> 02:53:12.464]  We've all heard news stories about products that cause cancer, birth defects, or other health problems.
[02:53:12.844 --> 02:53:17.505]  Well, many people who have used Miracle-2 products have stated that they have literally washed their problems away.
[02:53:18.165 --> 02:53:20.565]  The folks from Miracle-2 don't have to make these claims.
[02:53:20.845 --> 02:53:22.406]  Their customers do it for them.
[02:53:22.946 --> 02:53:26.766]  Try Miracle-2 and you just might find yourself working miracles in your home.
[02:53:27.246 --> 02:53:29.107]  Call the Power Hour Order Line, 877-485-3838.
[02:53:29.187 --> 02:53:32.007]  Place your order today and start having miracles in your life.
[02:53:36.826 --> 02:53:39.067]  Call 877-485-3838.
[02:53:40.708 --> 02:53:42.389]  Miracle, too, isn't just soap.
[02:53:42.830 --> 02:53:43.850]  It's a miracle.
[02:53:52.215 --> 02:53:56.558]  My friends, we'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central.
[02:53:56.578 --> 02:53:59.219]  It's our final segment with Hutton Gibson.
[02:53:59.239 --> 02:54:02.021]  It's been a great show today, very informative and, frankly, scary.
[02:54:03.289 --> 02:54:17.814]  For those that missed it, one more time, the address, $10 to get Is the Pope Catholic, is 141 Irish Street, Summersville, West Virginia, and the zip is 26651.
[02:54:18.374 --> 02:54:26.117]  That's 141 Irish Street, like the people of Ireland, 141 Irish Street, Summersville, West Virginia, 26651.
[02:54:30.026 --> 02:54:33.149]  And how much to get the newsletter, Hutton?
[02:54:33.869 --> 02:54:34.910]  Five dollars a year.
[02:54:34.990 --> 02:54:38.814]  I put it out roughly three or four times a year.
[02:54:38.854 --> 02:54:40.155]  I don't guarantee that.
[02:54:40.575 --> 02:54:41.636]  It's about eight pages.
[02:54:42.737 --> 02:54:46.981]  So it's a periodical and intelligence report, basically, on what's going on?
[02:54:47.501 --> 02:54:49.042]  Mostly on the religious side.
[02:54:49.142 --> 02:54:50.744]  Once in a while I get political, but...
[02:54:52.305 --> 02:54:59.210]  All right, well, again, folks, that's 141 Irish Street, Summersville, West Virginia, and the zip is 26651.
[02:55:00.111 --> 02:55:07.776]  Hutton, in the last few minutes we've got left, and I definitely want to have you back up again in the future to get more into the New World Order, because I respect your opinion and research on it.
[02:55:08.196 --> 02:55:09.057]  What are solutions?
[02:55:09.117 --> 02:55:11.518]  How do we turn this around?
[02:55:11.859 --> 02:55:15.521]  It's the total takeover of every institution by the New World Order.
[02:55:17.102 --> 02:55:17.523]  Well, my...
[02:55:19.266 --> 02:55:24.048]  The only practical thing that I can think of to do it bloodlessly is secession.
[02:55:25.689 --> 02:55:27.930]  Just tell every state, get out of the union.
[02:55:30.131 --> 02:55:33.293]  Disown the federal government and let it sit there with its public debt.
[02:55:35.574 --> 02:55:38.916]  Well, that's what the Declaration of Independence says we should do.
[02:55:38.936 --> 02:55:45.719]  Yeah, it says that when the government does not take care of you, you have the right to alter or abolish it.
[02:55:46.351 --> 02:55:50.254]  Yeah, when it starts becoming destructive of the Bill of Rights and Constitution, bye-bye.
[02:55:50.874 --> 02:55:53.857]  But FEMA says the Declaration of Independence is bad.
[02:55:53.877 --> 02:55:54.797]  I better listen to them.
[02:55:55.458 --> 02:55:56.118]  Oh, yeah, sure.
[02:55:57.059 --> 02:55:57.539]  I'll do that.
[02:55:59.841 --> 02:56:09.228]  They've got a set of laws in, I think Bush signed them in in 1991 sometime, about these seven Noahide laws.
[02:56:10.385 --> 02:56:14.787]  And, you know, you're supposed to obey a bunch of laws and nobody knows what they are.
[02:56:15.187 --> 02:56:16.667]  Well, that's like Patriot Act II.
[02:56:16.727 --> 02:56:17.928]  Most of that is secret.
[02:56:20.069 --> 02:56:23.770]  Yeah, but ignorance of the law is no excuse, is it?
[02:56:24.990 --> 02:56:26.691]  But they've designed ignorance into it.
[02:56:27.031 --> 02:56:27.231]  Yeah.
[02:56:28.712 --> 02:56:30.873]  Well, also, we've got the Supreme Court rulings.
[02:56:30.973 --> 02:56:33.714]  If something's destructive of the Constitution, it's null and void.
[02:56:34.074 --> 02:56:36.975]  I'm not going to follow their corrupt laws.
[02:56:37.095 --> 02:56:40.016]  When you've got criminals running things, what do you do, Hutton?
[02:56:41.201 --> 02:56:42.641]  Well, you get out from under.
[02:56:44.622 --> 02:56:48.743]  You say, you boys don't belong here.
[02:56:49.743 --> 02:56:52.983]  We're going to leave.
[02:56:53.003 --> 02:56:57.664]  That's a little more practical than saying, you guys get out.
[02:57:00.005 --> 02:57:00.445]  I don't know.
[02:57:00.465 --> 02:57:01.865]  It may come to that.
[02:57:02.325 --> 02:57:06.226]  So basically, coming out of Babylon, I agree, we should have some states to see.
[02:57:06.286 --> 02:57:09.427]  That'll send the message and have some pockets of liberty that are left.
[02:57:09.447 --> 02:57:09.507]  And...
[02:57:10.678 --> 02:57:12.959]  We're not going to fix the country by taking over Washington.
[02:57:12.979 --> 02:57:16.221]  We're going to fix it by taking over our counties, our cities, our states.
[02:57:16.741 --> 02:57:17.761]  That's how it's going to happen.
[02:57:17.801 --> 02:57:26.886]  Hutton Gibson, it's good to know that they're wholesome, decent people like yourself and your wife and your children and grandchildren out there fighting the globalists.
[02:57:27.046 --> 02:57:28.647]  And it was great to have you on the show.
[02:57:28.747 --> 02:57:31.788]  And be careful on your upcoming trip, and God bless you.
[02:57:32.348 --> 02:57:32.709]  Thank you.
[02:57:32.809 --> 02:57:33.969]  It's been a pleasure to be here.
[02:57:34.369 --> 02:57:35.070]  Good to be with you.
[02:57:35.090 --> 02:57:35.470]  Take care.
[02:57:36.330 --> 02:57:37.431]  Well, there goes Hutton Gibson.
[02:57:37.451 --> 02:57:39.232]  He is such a nice guy and so smart.
[02:57:41.187 --> 02:57:43.789]  And I really enjoy talking to him off air.
[02:57:44.470 --> 02:57:46.071]  He's got an encyclopedic brain.
[02:57:47.772 --> 02:57:50.514]  Knows so much history, it's amazing.
[02:57:50.655 --> 02:57:53.837]  And those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[02:57:54.177 --> 02:57:56.079]  I'll be back tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central.
[02:57:56.419 --> 02:57:58.481]  Bunch of big guests and key news coming up this week.
[02:57:58.821 --> 02:57:59.942]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:58:00.402 --> 02:58:01.643]  I'm a documentary filmmaker.
[02:58:01.763 --> 02:58:03.765]  I've written a book, and I've published another book.
[02:58:04.205 --> 02:58:12.107]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to look at all the documents and free video clips.
[02:58:12.227 --> 02:58:15.888]  Or to perhaps order some of my videos or books and spread the word.
[02:58:15.968 --> 02:58:19.189]  So InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or 1-888-253-3139.
[02:58:26.224 --> 02:58:29.225]  If good men do nothing, evil men and tyrants flourish.
[02:58:29.645 --> 02:58:33.587]  We have got to stand in the gap against these people and defend civilization.
[02:58:33.607 --> 02:58:34.527]  God bless you all.
[02:58:35.747 --> 02:58:39.008]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:58:39.069 --> 02:58:43.210]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:58:43.490 --> 02:58:46.292]  But if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:58:46.472 --> 02:58:48.873]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:58:49.053 --> 02:58:57.718]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:58:57.898 --> 02:58:59.258]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:58:59.438 --> 02:59:05.662]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path of the self-sterilizing filters.
[02:59:05.922 --> 02:59:11.885]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts,
[02:59:12.045 --> 02:59:14.947]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
