[00:00:05.376 --> 00:00:06.037]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.697 --> 00:00:07.758]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.458 --> 00:00:09.619]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:11.040]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.701]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.361 --> 00:00:17.143]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.544 --> 00:00:21.666]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.411 --> 00:00:32.633]  It's like it's Monday, but no, it's
[00:00:33.396 --> 00:00:34.137]  Thursday.
[00:00:36.398 --> 00:00:41.662]  Already, my friends, the 29th day of April 2004.
[00:00:41.782 --> 00:00:51.068]  We'll be live for the next three hours, and we're about to jump straight into all of this important news and information.
[00:00:51.768 --> 00:00:57.412]  It's posted on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:01:01.934 --> 00:01:06.375]  Biochip featured at Government Health Showcase.
[00:01:07.535 --> 00:01:09.675]  Syringe injectable device.
[00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:18.157]  One of 20 top innovative health technologies chosen by Health and Human Services to be showcased by the government.
[00:01:18.177 --> 00:01:23.818]  And we have Declan McCullough's article here that he posted out of UPI about the plans to put it in the homeless.
[00:01:25.078 --> 00:01:28.719]  So we'll be getting into that here early in the first hour.
[00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.559]  We'll also have wide open phones at 1-800-
[00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:34.095]  2599231, U.S.
[00:01:35.396 --> 00:01:41.560]  use of depleted uranium weapons causes a dangerous rise in radiation level in Iraq.
[00:01:42.861 --> 00:01:47.264]  Canadian research centers have reported that during the war against Iraq, the U.S.
[00:01:47.304 --> 00:01:52.327]  military used depleted uranium weapons, which caused the radiation level to rise at least 300 times above normal.
[00:01:54.525 --> 00:01:57.187]  And the weapons cause similar effects in Afghanistan.
[00:01:57.227 --> 00:02:00.069]  Folks, this is a nuclear war.
[00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:17.643]  We attack them, that is the global issues in America, with nuclear weapons, with dirty bombs, with thousands and thousands of tons of radioactive, highly radioactive material, hidden in plain view.
[00:02:17.663 --> 00:02:23.748]  The average person has no idea this is even going on, even despite the fact that the Associated Press, the New York Daily News...
[00:02:24.788 --> 00:02:26.869]  The Canadian papers are reporting this.
[00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:33.212]  The troops have between one to two rims of radiation in them.
[00:02:33.332 --> 00:02:38.074]  Two rims will kill a lot of people in many cases.
[00:02:38.174 --> 00:02:41.616]  So, again, support the troops.
[00:02:41.656 --> 00:02:44.317]  Let them die of radiation and blast the whole country with it.
[00:02:45.718 --> 00:02:48.819]  Hussein's agents are behind attacks in Iraq, Pentagon, fine.
[00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.440]  So now the Shiites suddenly...
[00:02:51.187 --> 00:02:53.609]  Why, they always worked for Saddam.
[00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:54.690]  They were big buddies with him.
[00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:04.058]  That's like saying the Jews were buddies with Hitler or something, or that Sylvester was friends with Tweety Bird.
[00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.720]  But no, yes, they worked for him, too.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.841]  They all do.
[00:03:08.182 --> 00:03:10.344]  They're all working for him secretly.
[00:03:11.164 --> 00:03:12.385]  It's not the Iraqi people.
[00:03:12.445 --> 00:03:13.686]  They love us.
[00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:15.448]  No, they love the uranium.
[00:03:15.488 --> 00:03:16.629]  They just love all of it.
[00:03:18.428 --> 00:03:25.415]  Defectors say North Korea train accident may have been linked to possible plot to murder Kim Jong-il.
[00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:33.082]  The South China Channel News Asia and being reported on out of the United States will get into that.
[00:03:34.042 --> 00:03:37.145]  Oil hits 13-year high amid low U.S.
[00:03:37.185 --> 00:03:37.686]  inventory.
[00:03:37.786 --> 00:03:38.867]  Sure, that's the reason.
[00:03:39.628 --> 00:03:42.832]  Bull shows growing doubts on Iraq.
[00:03:43.012 --> 00:03:46.035]  Abuse of Iraqi POWs by GIs is being probed.
[00:03:46.656 --> 00:03:51.521]  Army scientists eye new smallpox vaccine they want to force you to take.
[00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.930]  Also, Bush-Cheney 9-11 interview won't be formally recorded.
[00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.490]  It won't be televised.
[00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.151]  You won't be able to see it in secret.
[00:04:00.591 --> 00:04:01.551]  More whitewashing.
[00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:05.352]  White House braces for the latest assault by Hardback, a former U.S.
[00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:10.813]  ambassador, will this week quote out a government official who named his wife as a CIA operative.
[00:04:11.173 --> 00:04:12.354]  Burning hundreds, by the way.
[00:04:12.914 --> 00:04:18.475]  Andrew Bulcombe examines the latest Musgrave Memoir tracking the Bush administration.
[00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.933]  ACLU reveals secret suit over FBI powers.
[00:04:23.393 --> 00:04:26.536]  Hey, when you order a pizza, it goes into the Matrix database.
[00:04:26.596 --> 00:04:27.797]  This is USA Today.
[00:04:28.258 --> 00:04:34.243]  Everything you do with big corporations, they're just openly transferring it directly to state and local governments as well as federal.
[00:04:35.184 --> 00:04:37.105]  Again, UPI, U.S.
[00:04:37.125 --> 00:04:46.814]  Department of Health and Human Services, said that it was about to begin testing a new technology designed to help more closely monitor and assist the nation's homeless population in findable microchips.
[00:04:47.461 --> 00:04:54.365]  They're going to have robots, robot traffic cones, swarm on the highways, block the highways to keep us all safe.
[00:04:55.126 --> 00:04:55.806]  Little robots.
[00:04:55.826 --> 00:04:57.187]  That's a new scientist.
[00:04:57.627 --> 00:04:58.348]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:58.368 --> 00:04:58.748]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.914 --> 00:05:06.436]  Old timers remember a time when things were a bit slower, and most folks really did take the time to stop and smell the roses.
[00:05:06.676 --> 00:05:12.258]  That was back when gardeners grew tomatoes that tasted like tomato, and watermelons that tasted like watermelon was supposed to.
[00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:14.819]  Sweet corn that was real sweet sweet corn.
[00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:15.999]  Well, you get the idea.
[00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:26.083]  Too bad the biggest seed companies became big greed companies, and decided that hybrids grown in hothouses, artificially ripened with gas, could be grown much quicker, fetching more money at the large grocery stores.
[00:05:26.383 --> 00:05:35.868]  Folks at the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company remember that simpler time and are proud to be offering non-GMO heirloom seeds to gardeners who value flavor and variety over speed and greed.
[00:05:36.068 --> 00:05:45.153]  There's seed for fruits and vegetables of all kinds, seed for flowers and herbs, annuals and perennials, and some great books written by experts in the field to help get you started on the road to success.
[00:05:45.533 --> 00:05:45.833]  We're good.
[00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:13.868]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:06:13.908 --> 00:06:16.689]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.232]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:21.312 --> 00:06:28.237]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:28.377 --> 00:06:30.378]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:30.618 --> 00:06:41.087]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:41.367 --> 00:06:46.711]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:06:47.252 --> 00:06:49.914]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:06:50.014 --> 00:06:51.175]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:51.195 --> 00:06:51.636]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:51.716 --> 00:06:53.437]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:00.552 --> 00:07:03.556]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:07:03.897 --> 00:07:12.728]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:07:13.049 --> 00:07:17.735]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:07:18.175 --> 00:07:24.898]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:07:25.298 --> 00:07:37.084]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:07:37.564 --> 00:07:38.004]  Big Brother.
[00:07:38.044 --> 00:07:38.605]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.704 --> 00:08:07.784]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.465 --> 00:08:09.585]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.225 --> 00:08:11.046]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.806 --> 00:08:12.706]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.367 --> 00:08:17.068]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.548 --> 00:08:21.670]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:29.013 --> 00:08:31.514]  In the First Gulf War...
[00:08:33.425 --> 00:08:49.993]  In 1991, beginning with Desert Shield in 1990, then the actual war, in 1991, they used a smaller amount of depleted uranium, different federal numbers say 10 times the amount was used,
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.422]  This year and last year, compared to what was used in 1991, some numbers say 20 times.
[00:08:55.822 --> 00:09:03.385]  No one's really sure, but in the first Gulf War, the fighting was limited to the south, around Kuwait and a few other areas.
[00:09:03.445 --> 00:09:07.507]  They didn't use a lot of depleted uranium comparatively.
[00:09:07.747 --> 00:09:10.108]  Still, any of it is too much.
[00:09:10.168 --> 00:09:17.311]  They used quite a bit of it all over the Balkans in three separate conflicts that NATO and the U.S.
[00:09:17.771 --> 00:09:18.912]  have been involved with.
[00:09:19.986 --> 00:09:26.409]  But now, in the Second Gulf War, they used it in a lot of big cities.
[00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:29.130]  In Basra, in Baghdad, in Fallujah.
[00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:39.274]  In dozens of towns, they used thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of tons of depleted uranium.
[00:09:41.315 --> 00:10:03.308]  And the French, the Canadians, the British, the Australians, independent scientific firms, former Pentagon officials, people have gone over there, they've tested the air, they've tested the water, they've tested the sand, they've tested the buildings, they've tested the troops' blood, and there is just huge levels of depleted uranium.
[00:10:03.368 --> 00:10:05.310]  Levels that will kill you.
[00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.431]  People are dying.
[00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:23.131]  A few weeks ago we had Dr. Rocky on the broadcast who literally wrote the book, the manuals back in the 80s, on depleted uranium and how to protect against it, when and where you can use it.
[00:10:23.877 --> 00:10:24.578]  This is nuclear war.
[00:10:24.598 --> 00:10:24.858]  The first...
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.201]  Nuclear war.
[00:10:48.621 --> 00:10:51.962]  It was an atomic war in 1945 with Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[00:10:51.982 --> 00:10:53.203]  That was the first use of atomics.
[00:10:53.243 --> 00:10:55.124]  Now, in 1991, the first nuclear war was in Iraq.
[00:10:55.144 --> 00:10:55.924]  Then in 94, 95, 98 in the Balkans.
[00:10:56.845 --> 00:10:58.506]  And now in 2003 into 2004.
[00:11:15.482 --> 00:11:16.943]  And it's hidden in plain view.
[00:11:17.123 --> 00:11:18.944]  It's massive what's happened.
[00:11:19.044 --> 00:11:25.269]  There are eight sites, at least in the U.S., where they've used thousands and thousands of pounds of DU and test.
[00:11:25.629 --> 00:11:27.070]  That's gotten into drinking water.
[00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:33.434]  It has a half-life of 500 million years.
[00:11:34.415 --> 00:11:37.517]  So it doesn't start degrading for 500 million years.
[00:11:38.017 --> 00:11:38.517]  You can forget
[00:11:43.346 --> 00:11:46.867]  About these places ever being properly livable.
[00:11:48.948 --> 00:11:51.669]  And it shows the insanity of the globalists.
[00:11:51.869 --> 00:11:57.571]  Arming Pakistan, arming North Korea, arming China with nuclear weapons and nuclear delivery systems.
[00:11:58.832 --> 00:12:02.593]  And now USA Today, poll, Iraqis losing patience.
[00:12:03.033 --> 00:12:06.215]  Many say Saddam's fall benefited them, but most want U.S.
[00:12:06.255 --> 00:12:07.235]  troops to leave now.
[00:12:07.833 --> 00:12:08.073]  I think.
[00:12:26.011 --> 00:12:26.211]  Thank you.
[00:12:47.713 --> 00:12:54.356]  Better off now than they were under Saddam, and a strong majority say they are more free to worship and to speak.
[00:12:54.496 --> 00:13:02.559]  But while they acknowledge the benefits from dumping Saddam a year ago, Iraqis no longer see the presence of American-led military as a plus.
[00:13:03.239 --> 00:13:15.785]  Ask whether the U.S.-led coalition as liberators or occupiers, 71% of those correspondents say that they see it as an occupation, not as liberators.
[00:13:16.545 --> 00:13:23.030]  So again, 71% of responders say they see the U.S.
[00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:25.492]  as occupiers, not as liberators.
[00:13:27.033 --> 00:13:28.294]  Well, what about our troops?
[00:13:28.494 --> 00:13:36.140]  I mean, now it's over 800 that have died that they're admitting, not to mention the hundreds of mercenaries that have been killed and civilian contractors.
[00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:49.297]  Not to mention the admitted 20,000 dead Iraqi civilians in the last, what is it now, almost 400 days since all of this began.
[00:13:50.357 --> 00:13:51.438]  This is horrible.
[00:13:52.539 --> 00:13:58.322]  And the neocons don't want to discuss how we're losing our freedoms here domestically.
[00:13:58.602 --> 00:14:00.423]  You know, we need Operation Death.
[00:14:01.366 --> 00:14:02.808]  American freedom.
[00:14:03.248 --> 00:14:05.330]  We need the Bill of Rights and Constitution here.
[00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:24.568]  I mean, the scapegoat for all of this was the CIA's former minion and control system, known as Saddam Hussein, who they put into power, who they demanded the Ba'athists in 67, put in as the head of security, who they installed in 79, who they told to invade Iran.
[00:14:25.589 --> 00:14:28.590]  Who they told go ahead and invade Kuwait, and that's on the record.
[00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.031]  April Gillespie admits it, the U.S.
[00:14:30.071 --> 00:14:30.531]  ambassador.
[00:14:30.931 --> 00:14:32.252]  I mean, this is sick, people.
[00:14:34.113 --> 00:14:44.997]  But they push all this, they support all this in 1990 with the ambassador's daughters talking about, you know, throwing babies out of incubators, now admitted to be a PR firm lie.
[00:14:45.557 --> 00:14:51.520]  Today they support this with lies about Niger uranium and...
[00:14:52.631 --> 00:14:53.532]  We're good to go.
[00:14:53.652 --> 00:14:54.073]  We're good to go.
[00:15:10.585 --> 00:15:17.186]  But still, the shallow-minded people out there who aren't stupid, they're just not focused in the geopolitical realm.
[00:15:17.446 --> 00:15:23.807]  They're experts on basketball and football and cosmetics and home redesign or on cuisine.
[00:15:24.468 --> 00:15:25.668]  That's the American people.
[00:15:26.688 --> 00:15:28.228]  Or on their porno collection.
[00:15:28.808 --> 00:15:35.189]  They're not experts on how many states there are, who the vice president is, how many continents there are.
[00:15:35.429 --> 00:15:37.110]  They can't find Iraq on a map.
[00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.290]  Most Americans can't.
[00:15:39.148 --> 00:15:43.150]  But they'll give you their opinion all day about Iraq and say, oh yeah, they found mass graves.
[00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.871]  They found mobile weapons trucks while they had that weapons dossier.
[00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:48.132]  And I go, no, they admit that was a lie.
[00:15:48.172 --> 00:15:49.253]  No, it's not, you liberal.
[00:15:49.733 --> 00:15:50.834]  Well, hey, I'm not the liberal.
[00:15:50.854 --> 00:16:00.498]  I'm not the one for open borders, the assault weapons ban, campaign finance reform, supercomputers to China, signing on to UNESCO, Patriot Acts, all of this garbage.
[00:16:01.354 --> 00:16:02.935]  So you better get your thinking caps on.
[00:16:02.975 --> 00:16:06.378]  I don't mean our general listeners, but those hearing this broadcast for the first time.
[00:16:06.738 --> 00:16:11.161]  You know, you say, oh, the liberals are against the war, the liberals are bad, so the war must be good.
[00:16:11.482 --> 00:16:16.405]  No, all the so-called liberal leadership voted for this war.
[00:16:16.786 --> 00:16:20.989]  The John Forbes Careys, the Hillarys, the Chuckie Schumers, the Wrangles.
[00:16:22.043 --> 00:16:24.387]  They're all for this fraud.
[00:16:24.788 --> 00:16:27.894]  And America's playing the part of the bad cop, going in for the U.N.
[00:16:27.934 --> 00:16:29.376]  to take over, and the U.N.
[00:16:29.416 --> 00:16:32.462]  comes in as the false savior, and it's just sick.
[00:16:34.312 --> 00:16:39.535]  Americans are being warned to leave Gaza immediately.
[00:16:39.615 --> 00:16:39.975]  The U.S.
[00:16:39.995 --> 00:16:40.956]  State Department warned U.S.
[00:16:40.996 --> 00:16:46.199]  citizens early today to leave Gaza immediately and not to travel to Israel and the Palestinian territories.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:57.306]  The new advice was issued due to current safety and security concerns and cited the killings of two Hamas leaders in Gaza and threats of revenge, including kidnappings, as the reason for the new warning.
[00:16:57.626 --> 00:17:06.250]  The Israeli military has been conducting a campaign against leaders of the Islamist group Hamas over the recent weeks, killing its founder and its successor.
[00:17:06.831 --> 00:17:11.753]  Israel has vowed to kill all Hamas leaders and said that the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat could be targeted.
[00:17:14.295 --> 00:17:20.918]  So it goes on and on there, the endless tribal warfare in that region that is not going to abate.
[00:17:21.644 --> 00:17:29.809]  I want to get into biochip featured at Government Health Showcase and a move to put it in the homeless population, but I mentioned depleting uranium.
[00:17:30.509 --> 00:17:32.371]  I want to go back into this, because this is a big deal.
[00:17:33.651 --> 00:17:34.432]  Very big deal.
[00:17:34.712 --> 00:17:36.573]  The byproduct of nuclear weapons production.
[00:17:37.374 --> 00:17:37.734]  U.S.
[00:17:37.874 --> 00:17:41.836]  use of depleting uranium weapons causes dangerous rise in radiation level in Iraq.
[00:17:41.856 --> 00:17:42.897]  Canadian research centers...
[00:17:44.221 --> 00:17:46.645]  Have reported that during the war against Iraq, the U.S.
[00:17:46.665 --> 00:17:54.158]  military used to put uranium or DU weapons, which caused the radiation level to rise at least 300 times above normal.
[00:17:54.218 --> 00:17:55.500]  That's in the country-wide.
[00:17:55.961 --> 00:17:56.662]  Certain areas, it's 1,300%.
[00:17:58.602 --> 00:18:01.183]  And the weapons cause similar effects in Afghanistan.
[00:18:01.263 --> 00:18:01.484]  U.S.
[00:18:01.504 --> 00:18:06.886]  troops have recently begun removing contaminated pop soil in Iraq, taking it to an unknown location.
[00:18:07.426 --> 00:18:08.327]  You can't remove it.
[00:18:08.367 --> 00:18:10.768]  It turns into dust when it hits the buildings, the tanks.
[00:18:11.228 --> 00:18:12.289]  It gets aerosolized.
[00:18:12.769 --> 00:18:19.252]  Scientists believe the next generation of children and citizens of both countries exposed to DU will suffer from higher rates of birth defects and cancer.
[00:18:20.593 --> 00:18:24.355]  Now, again, they claim that they're taking the stuff away.
[00:18:24.395 --> 00:18:25.415]  Dr. Rocky talked about it.
[00:18:25.435 --> 00:18:26.436]  There's no way to get rid of it.
[00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:30.309]  Those, even if they're in protective gear, it goes right through it.
[00:18:30.689 --> 00:18:33.152]  Imagine the troops that are having to supposedly clean this up.
[00:18:33.672 --> 00:18:40.740]  And all they can do is go to a shattered tank or shattered vehicle and drag it off to be shipped to the U.S.
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:41.441]  for smelting.
[00:18:43.132 --> 00:18:49.195]  Societies believe the next generation of children, of citizens, of both countries exposed to the EU will suffer from higher rates of birth defects and cancer.
[00:18:49.755 --> 00:19:02.360]  A Gulf War veteran, one, is three times more likely, and that's time-life, by the way, that one of their big articles about that years ago, the government's own numbers they reported on, three times more likely to be deformed.
[00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.481]  Oh, yes, this is a wonderful war, folks.
[00:19:05.781 --> 00:19:07.702]  Why did you use depleted uranium?
[00:19:08.322 --> 00:19:09.703]  There's no reason!
[00:19:10.848 --> 00:19:11.149]  Yes!
[00:19:11.309 --> 00:19:15.197]  I mean, if we drop nuclear weapons on our supposed enemies, that would end wars quicker.
[00:19:15.558 --> 00:19:17.923]  But you can't, you know, nuke everything, so they just use DU.
[00:19:19.187 --> 00:19:32.374]  The Iranian Medical Research Center, UNRC, issued a report based on a 13-day survey throughout the primary godlike zones in urban and rural areas of central and southern Iraq on October 2003, according to the RISQ News.
[00:19:32.895 --> 00:19:44.501]  They performed radiation surveys, nucleoid analysis, interviewed civilians and community leaders, collected biological and field samples, and investigated the possible health effects of the pretty uranium contamination on Iraq's civilians.
[00:19:45.469 --> 00:19:46.990]  According to the report, the U.S.
[00:19:47.031 --> 00:19:53.277]  has used uranium oxide deposits in strong explosives in common and in firebombs.
[00:19:54.678 --> 00:19:55.759]  And it goes on and on.
[00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:57.000]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:57.681]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.323 --> 00:20:04.185]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:20:04.545 --> 00:20:07.406]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:20:07.646 --> 00:20:13.850]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:21.534]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:20:21.714 --> 00:20:25.816]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[00:20:26.076 --> 00:20:31.619]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[00:20:31.819 --> 00:20:44.945]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.

[00:21:01.212 --> 00:21:01.872]  Urgent message.
[00:21:02.073 --> 00:21:09.315]  Effective April 14, 2004, heavy fines and penalties will be imposed for all persons and entities who are not in compliance with HIPAA.
[00:21:09.455 --> 00:21:13.056]  HIPAA is a federal law designed to protect all patients' private health information.
[00:21:13.336 --> 00:21:18.658]  It impacts over 30 million health professionals, but will also impact professionals outside of the medical field.
[00:21:18.858 --> 00:21:23.619]  This year, Health and Human Services has developed a program to reward those who report violators of HIPAA.
[00:21:23.679 --> 00:21:25.440]  There are thousands of violations currently,
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.020]  We're good to go.
[00:21:55.103 --> 00:21:55.686]  Call today, 720-312-0709.
[00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:05.013]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[00:22:05.233 --> 00:22:08.675]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[00:22:08.895 --> 00:22:11.356]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[00:22:11.597 --> 00:22:20.201]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[00:22:20.562 --> 00:22:26.325]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[00:22:26.605 --> 00:22:28.565]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[00:22:28.805 --> 00:22:35.727]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.
[00:22:36.067 --> 00:22:42.528]  Midas Resources is pleased to offer a subscription to the International Forecaster newsletter free of charge with a qualifying order.
[00:22:42.788 --> 00:22:43.269]  That's right.
[00:22:43.369 --> 00:22:50.110]  For a limited time, Midas Resources is offering a one-year subscription to Bob Chapman's powerful newsletter, the International Forecaster.
[00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:54.833]  Call 800-686-2237 for more information or to place your order.
[00:22:54.933 --> 00:22:55.634]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:56.314 --> 00:22:59.777]  Call today and avoid getting soaked tomorrow.
[00:23:00.237 --> 00:23:03.059]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[00:23:03.179 --> 00:23:04.020]  Michael Trudeau here.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.443]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[00:23:07.643 --> 00:23:10.765]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident...
[00:23:11.105 --> 00:23:13.286]  That injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[00:23:13.426 --> 00:23:16.487]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[00:23:16.707 --> 00:23:20.988]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[00:23:21.188 --> 00:23:23.089]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[00:23:23.209 --> 00:23:30.271]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[00:23:30.471 --> 00:23:32.932]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[00:23:33.172 --> 00:23:33.892]  We're good to go.
[00:24:04.002 --> 00:24:04.523]  Don't worry.
[00:24:04.983 --> 00:24:06.524]  This show is documented.
[00:24:07.025 --> 00:24:09.807]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:10.207 --> 00:24:13.690]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:15.912]  I went down, down, down.
[00:24:15.932 --> 00:24:16.712]  All right, my friends.
[00:24:16.732 --> 00:24:18.974]  The flames went higher.
[00:24:18.994 --> 00:24:20.976]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:25.419 --> 00:24:28.380]  That's 800-259-9231.
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:40.362]  Any of the news I've mentioned, anything you'd like to discuss, any news story that we're not aware of in your area, any propaganda you'd like to expose that you've witnessed on television or in the newspaper, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:40.682 --> 00:24:48.304]  But this depleted uranium situation, I mean, this shows the mindset of the globalists.
[00:24:49.064 --> 00:24:49.524]  Their own...
[00:24:50.755 --> 00:25:04.522]  Army and Los Alamos Nuclear Lab training manuals admit from the mid-'80s and then right through the 90s that this stuff is deadly if you breathe it, that it really shouldn't be used.
[00:25:04.602 --> 00:25:12.366]  And then we see later in the early 90s Army documents saying, well, we shouldn't discuss this or distribute these manuals because this weapon is just too good.
[00:25:12.406 --> 00:25:13.287]  We've got to use it.
[00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:19.855]  I mean, yeah, you could release a race-specific bioweapon in the Middle East to kill all the Arabs.
[00:25:20.275 --> 00:25:22.076]  That would end the problem real fast.
[00:25:22.597 --> 00:25:29.282]  But you don't do that because, you know, 99.9% of them aren't the supposed terrorists and are human beings.
[00:25:30.763 --> 00:25:38.410]  And plus, it would kill a lot of people in Israel because a lot of people in Israel have identical DNA to what they call Arabs or Palestinians.
[00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:42.573]  So that would kind of be a problem.
[00:25:44.653 --> 00:25:54.937]  You know, kind of the European Israelis, kind of the carpetbackers, the blonde-haired, blue-eyed ones that seem to run all the real Israelis there.
[00:25:55.838 --> 00:25:57.798]  That's a whole other subject.
[00:25:57.999 --> 00:25:59.139]  They'll be just fine.
[00:25:59.719 --> 00:26:04.341]  And they're the ones who are openly developing race-specific bioweapons to kill Semitic people.
[00:26:04.741 --> 00:26:07.362]  Boy, if you're a real Jew, I'd be concerned about that.
[00:26:07.742 --> 00:26:08.122]  Ha ha.
[00:26:08.503 --> 00:26:09.083]  Ha ha ha.
[00:26:09.443 --> 00:26:10.083]  Ha ha ha ha.
[00:26:10.503 --> 00:26:10.903]  Okay.
[00:26:11.684 --> 00:26:11.864]  So...
[00:26:13.092 --> 00:26:15.533]  Look, I mean, depleted uranium?
[00:26:16.554 --> 00:26:18.515]  Depleted uranium?
[00:26:19.095 --> 00:26:22.116]  I didn't mention Afghanistan.
[00:26:22.136 --> 00:26:30.080]  I mentioned Iraq won, Serbia, you know, Bosnia where they used it three separate times.
[00:26:30.601 --> 00:26:35.363]  And, of course, I forgot Afghanistan used tons of it there, literal tons of it.
[00:26:36.778 --> 00:26:52.185]  And when they use this in tanks, or in rockets, or fired out of Gatling guns, out of A-10 Warthogs, or out of C-130 Spectre gunships, which they're doing in Basra right now, and not Basra, Fallujah, and areas of Baghdad, excuse me.
[00:26:52.565 --> 00:26:56.367]  I mean, they just fly around using this, and it's killing our troops.
[00:26:56.427 --> 00:26:57.228]  It's maiming them.
[00:26:57.268 --> 00:26:58.128]  It's making them sick.
[00:26:58.903 --> 00:27:07.889]  You can easily go, I don't care about them Iraqis, them, you know, use your racial terms for them that seem to be acceptable in the media.
[00:27:08.309 --> 00:27:11.691]  Only group that's acceptable will be racist towards, I guess, nowadays.
[00:27:11.771 --> 00:27:13.012]  But what about our troops?
[00:27:13.732 --> 00:27:15.073]  I mean, our troops are sick.
[00:27:15.133 --> 00:27:16.294]  They're dying from this.
[00:27:17.415 --> 00:27:26.180]  And as usual, like every other war, when they come back and are dead and dying and have all these deformed children and the nightmares of that, can you imagine the pain of that?
[00:27:26.957 --> 00:27:27.858]  It'll be okay.
[00:27:27.878 --> 00:27:32.582]  They'll just sweep him under the rug, and a couple years from now, see a few news articles, and, oh, that's too bad.
[00:27:32.622 --> 00:27:33.523]  They shouldn't have done that.
[00:27:33.583 --> 00:27:39.247]  But I still love George W. I still love Bill Clinton.
[00:27:39.908 --> 00:27:41.569]  I still love Hillary.
[00:27:41.589 --> 00:27:44.212]  You know, all of these people, they're all for it.
[00:27:44.232 --> 00:27:45.232]  They're all behind it.
[00:27:45.473 --> 00:27:47.414]  They're all just puppets of the New World Order.
[00:27:49.116 --> 00:27:54.140]  The most disturbing circumstances was observed in the U.S.-occupied basin southwestern Baghdad
[00:27:55.442 --> 00:28:04.504]  It was close to the International Airport and hosts one of the largest coalition bases around Baghdad occupying the operational headquarters of the Iraqi Special Republican Guard.
[00:28:05.424 --> 00:28:16.347]  The area was subject to considerable aerial bombardment and rocket fire prior to the coalition ground forces arrival, followed by several ground skirmishes along the main routes at the International Airport and western entrances in the city.
[00:28:17.187 --> 00:28:22.408]  And it admits that the Department of Defense says that it is high radiation and that's where our troops stay.
[00:28:23.104 --> 00:28:30.070]  See, all the places where the Iraqis were concentrated, the Iraqi troops, that's what got bombarded, and that's where our troops stay.
[00:28:31.917 --> 00:28:40.081]  Departing the Coalition occupied base was a long and steady stream of tandem axle dump trucks carrying full loads of sand heading south away from the city.
[00:28:40.141 --> 00:28:45.623]  Returning from the south was a second stream of fully loaded dump trucks waiting to enter the base.
[00:28:46.123 --> 00:28:55.747]  As the team passed the base's main entrance, the gates were opened to reveal bulldozers spreading soil while front-end loaders were filling the trucks that had just emptied the loads of soil.
[00:28:57.109 --> 00:29:00.293]  And so the method of topsoil removal and replacement of the U.S.
[00:29:00.333 --> 00:29:15.449]  occupied bases, living facilities, administrative buildings is mechanically redepositing tons of potentially contaminated particulate, and the dust clouds are wafting it above and spreading over the entire area of the 5 million residents in Baghdad alone.
[00:29:16.224 --> 00:29:17.065]  Yeah, that's the point.
[00:29:17.585 --> 00:29:23.909]  They fire tons of this stuff into the cities, and then they go around with bulldozers as if that cleans it up.
[00:29:24.289 --> 00:29:31.134]  That's because the troops all know it's dangerous, and so the Pentagon goes, don't worry, we'll scoop it away and take it away.
[00:29:31.734 --> 00:29:35.857]  Which, frankly, a lot of people say is even worse, because that then stirs it all up.
[00:29:36.937 --> 00:29:38.639]  So I want you to answer the question.
[00:29:38.959 --> 00:29:45.323]  I want Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity and all these people that claim they care about the troops, I want you to talk about DU's.
[00:29:46.914 --> 00:29:48.075]  But no, you won't, will you?
[00:29:48.176 --> 00:29:49.357]  We'll be back with your calls.
[00:29:51.499 --> 00:29:52.380]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.881 --> 00:29:54.483]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.404 --> 00:29:58.107]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.872 --> 00:30:02.853]  It's finally here.
[00:30:02.993 --> 00:30:03.973]  Spring has arrived.
[00:30:04.173 --> 00:30:07.115]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:30:07.355 --> 00:30:10.797]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:30:11.017 --> 00:30:19.182]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can too with the help of the ARC Institute's brand new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[00:32:00.855 --> 00:32:03.617]  What kind of gift can you give to someone who has everything?
[00:32:04.038 --> 00:32:05.119]  Are you running out of ideas?
[00:32:05.579 --> 00:32:06.200]  Out of time?
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.863]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?
[00:32:10.543 --> 00:32:11.164]  Just listen.
[00:32:40.417 --> 00:32:48.320]  Birthday coming soon?
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.440]  Anniversary?
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.641]  Wedding perhaps?
[00:32:51.241 --> 00:32:52.161]  Mother's Day's coming up?
[00:33:02.641 --> 00:33:07.784]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:08.464 --> 00:33:10.806]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:13.207 --> 00:33:14.108]  We're on the march.
[00:33:14.188 --> 00:33:16.249]  The empire's on the run.
[00:33:18.391 --> 00:33:20.112]  The globalists create enemies.
[00:33:20.152 --> 00:33:23.053]  They create surrogates to go out and wreak havoc.
[00:33:23.914 --> 00:33:25.595]  There's several different types of surrogates.
[00:33:25.635 --> 00:33:26.876]  There's the terror arm.
[00:33:27.717 --> 00:33:34.340]  That is actually MI5, MI6, CIA, Mossad, FSB in Russia.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.861]  They'll go out, blow something up, and then openly blame it on sympathies.
[00:33:39.442 --> 00:33:41.002]  We've caught all those groups doing that.
[00:33:41.963 --> 00:33:43.743]  We've even caught the Arabs doing it from time to time.
[00:33:44.644 --> 00:33:46.845]  Well, they don't seem to be as sophisticated in some of this stuff.
[00:33:48.545 --> 00:33:51.026]  Then there's what we call the wind-up toy.
[00:33:52.047 --> 00:33:55.568]  And a Hitler or a Stalin or a Mao is a wind-up toy.
[00:33:56.701 --> 00:34:05.206]  Our government attempted to make Ho Chi Minh a wind-up toy and funded him with $987 million.
[00:34:07.068 --> 00:34:10.170]  Right through World War II, right up to 1960.
[00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:12.291]  Ho Chi Minh!
[00:34:13.332 --> 00:34:21.677]  Yes, and our own government, I'll never forget History Channel a few years ago, had the old CIA section chief on there from Asia.
[00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:25.211]  Saying, oh yeah, we actually put Mao into power.
[00:34:25.231 --> 00:34:27.072]  We thought he was a great stabilizing effect.
[00:34:27.132 --> 00:34:30.613]  And, of course, David Rockefeller told the New York Times that as well.
[00:34:30.653 --> 00:34:33.874]  We've got that in my book, Dissent and Eternity, with the date and when he said it.
[00:34:35.615 --> 00:34:36.835]  But this is what they do.
[00:34:36.975 --> 00:34:52.281]  Now, those are wind-up toys where you fund a terrorist, you fund a despot, and then later you then either really fight them, you build up a war machine to fight them, or you build up a war machine just to, quote, counter them and protect yourselves from them.
[00:34:53.402 --> 00:35:00.747]  Or you build up a Hitler and then have him run around crazily and then get to have your big war and out of that bring in your own brand of tyranny.
[00:35:01.728 --> 00:35:03.469]  Well, it's the same thing over and over again.
[00:35:04.329 --> 00:35:08.612]  We're about to go to Ken and Helga and Caroline and Wyatt and Dad and others.
[00:35:09.473 --> 00:35:14.376]  And then I'll get into biochip featured at Government Health Showcase.
[00:35:16.717 --> 00:35:21.820]  Also, we'll get into Hussein's agents are behind attacks in Iraq, Pentagon finds.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.001]  Yes, now the Shiites suddenly work for him.
[00:35:25.141 --> 00:35:25.762]  Sure they do.
[00:35:26.402 --> 00:35:28.983]  And again, Sylvester is friends with Twittyburg.
[00:35:30.424 --> 00:35:38.648]  Defectors say North Korea train accident may have been linked to a possible plot to murder Kim.
[00:35:39.577 --> 00:35:41.138]  And it says again, Defector St.
[00:35:41.158 --> 00:35:46.021]  North Korea train accident may have been linked to possible plot to murder Kim.
[00:35:46.041 --> 00:35:47.681]  This is out of Channel News Asia.
[00:35:49.282 --> 00:35:53.965]  And then we'll get into this Financial Times of London article.
[00:35:54.465 --> 00:35:57.327]  Oil hits 13-year high amid low U.S.
[00:35:57.427 --> 00:35:59.248]  inventories, and that is not the reason.
[00:35:59.828 --> 00:36:02.569]  Hole, growing doubts on Iraq, more on that.
[00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:05.691]  Abuse of Iraqi POWs by GIs is probed.
[00:36:06.191 --> 00:36:08.773]  Army scientist, I knew smallpox vaccine.
[00:36:09.614 --> 00:36:13.117]  Bush-Cheney 9-11 interview won't be formally recorded.
[00:36:14.398 --> 00:36:17.540]  White House bracing for latest assault by hardback former U.S.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:23.744]  ambassador will this week out a government official who named his wife as a CIA operative.
[00:36:24.665 --> 00:36:30.209]  Also, ACLU loyal opposition group reveals secret suit over FBI powers.
[00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:33.632]  And this one's really scary out of USA Today.
[00:36:34.592 --> 00:36:35.513]  Missouri tracks...
[00:36:37.612 --> 00:36:42.213]  SCOF laws, whatever that means, via pizza delivery database.
[00:36:43.734 --> 00:36:45.034]  And this is nationwide.
[00:36:45.554 --> 00:36:53.857]  It's the matrix system at the state level through the NSA tracking every pizza you buy, what you buy with credit cards, if it's a major chain.
[00:36:54.917 --> 00:36:57.098]  The little outfits can't and don't do this.
[00:36:57.318 --> 00:36:58.858]  It's big chains that do this.
[00:36:59.379 --> 00:37:01.819]  And they upload it directly to the government.
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.981]  Also, again, from UPI, move to put microchips in the homeless.
[00:37:07.811 --> 00:37:13.294]  This out of the new scientists, robotic traffic cones swarm onto highways.
[00:37:14.495 --> 00:37:21.478]  Little remote-controlled GPS robots to block the roads whenever they want and to squeeze down the lanes.
[00:37:21.558 --> 00:37:24.580]  And, of course, they'll have cameras on them watching you lovingly.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:28.362]  It's part of the new robot force to keep us safe.
[00:37:28.742 --> 00:37:31.143]  To block the highways so you can't escape during quarantine.
[00:37:32.484 --> 00:37:35.125]  Berlin cops suspended over Hitler salute.
[00:37:36.239 --> 00:37:41.383]  Florida town to use blanket surveillance cameras, despite the fact there's only 321 residents.
[00:37:41.864 --> 00:37:43.965]  They're going to watch everyone, though, with dozens of cameras.
[00:37:44.986 --> 00:37:47.528]  And then I've got all this incredible police state news.
[00:37:48.389 --> 00:37:57.315]  But before we get into all of that, for all the patient listeners, let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[00:37:58.476 --> 00:38:00.237]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ken in California.
[00:38:00.277 --> 00:38:00.838]  Ken, go ahead.
[00:38:01.502 --> 00:38:01.742]  Yes.
[00:38:02.363 --> 00:38:11.250]  Sybil Edmonds this morning revealed that if within 30 days the government does not come clean on what they know about 9-11, she's going to give all the documents to the media.
[00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:12.771]  I think this is great.
[00:38:13.832 --> 00:38:14.532]  She's a hero.
[00:38:15.293 --> 00:38:17.915]  Well, for those who don't know who Sybil Edmonds is, why don't you tell them?
[00:38:18.475 --> 00:38:21.858]  Well, she was an FBI translator shortly after 9-11.
[00:38:22.118 --> 00:38:30.665]  They had her translate documents that go back to April of 2001, in which there was plenty of evidence that the government had that we were going to be hit.
[00:38:31.761 --> 00:38:33.022]  And the government did nothing about it.
[00:38:33.382 --> 00:38:35.544]  Well, they were trying to have her falsify that.
[00:38:35.584 --> 00:38:38.166]  When she said, I'm not going to do this, they said, we're going to arrest you.
[00:38:38.726 --> 00:38:41.789]  Then Ashcroft called her and said, we'll give you a better job to shut up.
[00:38:42.529 --> 00:38:55.980]  And then on top of all of this now, in court yesterday, and I didn't see what happened with it, it was in the Washington Times, there was an attempt to gag her, a federal gag order to not let her lawyers talk.
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:58.301]  We're trying to get her lawyer on.
[00:38:58.321 --> 00:39:00.423]  I do have to say this, though.
[00:39:01.195 --> 00:39:09.030]  We were on her lawyer's website, and one of the chief partners of this high-powered law firm is one of the chief counsels for the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:39:09.331 --> 00:39:10.413]  Oh, no.
[00:39:10.473 --> 00:39:12.758]  Yeah, but look, again...
[00:39:14.062 --> 00:39:21.505]  I think Sybil Evans is for real because she wouldn't have talked to 15 news cameras and all the media and then have them all block it out at the Capitol.
[00:39:21.885 --> 00:39:23.885]  She testified the secret two months ago.
[00:39:24.365 --> 00:39:26.946]  The commission said that they were going to go public.
[00:39:27.246 --> 00:39:29.787]  They never did, so she went out and gave a press conference.
[00:39:30.287 --> 00:39:31.508]  Tom Flocko reported.
[00:39:31.548 --> 00:39:32.668]  The mainstream media ignored it.
[00:39:32.688 --> 00:39:35.369]  Then it got picked up by British papers finally here a little bit.
[00:39:36.033 --> 00:39:38.714]  So I don't think she's a shill, because they don't want this coming out.
[00:39:38.974 --> 00:39:39.775]  That's right.
[00:39:39.875 --> 00:39:41.315]  But it's kind of suspicious.
[00:39:41.975 --> 00:39:44.917]  At higher levels, we know there's infighting at the CFR.
[00:39:45.297 --> 00:39:52.039]  She could be being used as an unwitting set piece for some higher level people to get some goodies or something.
[00:39:52.059 --> 00:39:52.700]  I'm not sure.
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.380]  Again, that's just speculation.
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:55.421]  I don't like to speculate.
[00:39:56.181 --> 00:39:59.863]  But look, take Rowley, the FBI agent.
[00:40:00.103 --> 00:40:01.143]  Right.
[00:40:01.163 --> 00:40:03.224]  She's this chief counsel up in Minnesota.
[00:40:03.244 --> 00:40:03.364]  Right.
[00:40:04.931 --> 00:40:15.281]  This FBI Politico, you've got FBI agents in Texas, FBI agents in Phoenix, FBI agents in Illinois, like Robert Wright, specifically being threatened with arrest if they talk about what they know.
[00:40:15.301 --> 00:40:20.166]  We already have had their lawyers on the show before they were given gag orders threatened with arrest for the second time.
[00:40:20.627 --> 00:40:22.809]  They're lawyers themselves, David Shippers and others.
[00:40:23.996 --> 00:40:28.379]  That they specifically had the tales of 9-11, tried to give it to Bush, were threatened with arrest.
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:32.002]  You don't hear about them in the news, even when they're at the National Press Club.
[00:40:32.262 --> 00:40:37.906]  Who you hear about is Kathleen Rowley, who goes, oh, we messed up, give us more funding, we're just idiots.
[00:40:38.446 --> 00:40:43.510]  See, so when there's all these whistleblowers going, they'll bring out a few fake whistleblowers.
[00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:44.271]  You see what I'm saying?
[00:40:45.431 --> 00:40:50.275]  Now, Edmonds doesn't fit the bill on that, other than this CFR connection.
[00:40:51.627 --> 00:40:54.928]  Well, what I like about her is she said she's willing to go to jail over this thing.
[00:40:55.248 --> 00:40:58.410]  And I don't think that if she was really a shill that she would be saying that.
[00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:00.350]  I don't think she's a shill either.
[00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:02.131]  I just think that we have to be very careful.
[00:41:04.092 --> 00:41:09.934]  And we are attempting to get her on the broadcast for weeks now and trying to get the lawyer on.
[00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:12.249]  Hi, Alex.
[00:41:12.329 --> 00:41:12.709]  Welcome.
[00:41:12.749 --> 00:41:13.230]  Welcome, yeah.
[00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:13.350]  Um...
[00:41:41.641 --> 00:41:42.762]  The name depleted.
[00:41:42.782 --> 00:41:47.525]  I looked in all my books, which I bought before 91.
[00:41:47.685 --> 00:41:50.727]  The name, the term depleted.
[00:41:51.088 --> 00:41:52.369]  It is an improper term.
[00:41:52.469 --> 00:41:53.710]  It's improper.
[00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:57.312]  They simply take the isotope that is...
[00:41:58.644 --> 00:42:00.925]  I think it's 235, mostly 238.
[00:42:00.985 --> 00:42:08.169]  Yeah, they simply extract the type they want for the nuclear weapon or for the fuel rod, and then the other uranium is not depleted.
[00:42:08.189 --> 00:42:10.030]  The term is deceptive.
[00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:13.932]  Not depleted, and it wasn't.
[00:42:14.452 --> 00:42:19.595]  In 91, I was very much involved in the nuclear thing, and I have all those books around.
[00:42:19.735 --> 00:42:21.075]  I looked through everyone.
[00:42:21.095 --> 00:42:24.237]  The term depleted is not there.
[00:42:24.517 --> 00:42:28.379]  So that's a new term to sound less than total depleted.
[00:42:28.857 --> 00:42:29.737]  High level.
[00:42:30.197 --> 00:42:34.198]  Because at that time, it was high level, medium, and low level.
[00:42:34.999 --> 00:42:39.560]  Anyway, second thing, last night, I couldn't believe it.
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:47.202]  I listened to the business news on public TV, and I don't know who it was.
[00:42:47.222 --> 00:42:57.104]  It's just some guy who was, you know, that's where they give you the Wall Street report, and the stocks, and you know how they're doing, and
[00:42:57.679 --> 00:43:02.283]  When he comes to the economy, George Bush talks like John Wayne.
[00:43:02.343 --> 00:43:04.825]  And when he acts on the economy, it's like Winnie the Pooh.
[00:43:04.845 --> 00:43:05.286]  Can you imagine?
[00:43:05.326 --> 00:43:07.848]  Winnie the what?
[00:43:07.868 --> 00:43:09.169]  He acts like Winnie the Pooh.
[00:43:26.601 --> 00:43:29.762]  That's what I heard on that business news.
[00:43:30.542 --> 00:43:31.603]  Did you say poo?
[00:43:31.863 --> 00:43:32.403]  Poo, yeah.
[00:43:32.523 --> 00:43:33.623]  You know, we need a poo.
[00:43:34.424 --> 00:43:35.304]  The children book.
[00:43:37.745 --> 00:43:38.765]  We need a poo.
[00:43:39.105 --> 00:43:39.445]  Yes.
[00:43:39.885 --> 00:43:41.026]  Yes, that's what he said.
[00:43:41.406 --> 00:43:43.006]  That's all I can say.
[00:43:43.127 --> 00:43:47.328]  I don't know who that person was, but it was, you know, it comes here on...
[00:43:48.377 --> 00:43:57.386]  On, you know, public radio, Channel 9 at 5.30, the business news, Wall Street.
[00:43:57.766 --> 00:43:59.468]  Yeah, that's Channel 9 TV.
[00:43:59.588 --> 00:44:01.990]  Right, and that's where I heard it last night.
[00:44:02.271 --> 00:44:03.692]  I just couldn't believe it.
[00:44:03.772 --> 00:44:05.494]  I wrote it down as soon as I heard it.
[00:44:06.115 --> 00:44:14.017]  Hey, what do you think of this new Patriot Act Bush wants to pass with the death penalty for any federal crime with more than a year in prison?
[00:44:14.057 --> 00:44:20.178]  I mean, it scares me to hell when they put those things on paper because that's when it goes down to the police.
[00:44:20.719 --> 00:44:22.999]  And that's what we are seeing.
[00:44:23.099 --> 00:44:28.040]  We know that they always have done things, you know, above the law.
[00:44:28.661 --> 00:44:30.221]  But when it gets on paper...
[00:44:31.164 --> 00:44:42.671]  My God, I want to go off the wall, because that means it goes to people who are all of a sudden, who have been no one, and all of a sudden they're getting all those powers.
[00:44:42.811 --> 00:44:43.311]  That's right.
[00:44:43.331 --> 00:44:44.872]  I appreciate the call, Helga.
[00:44:44.892 --> 00:44:45.272]  Thank you.
[00:44:45.673 --> 00:44:47.033]  Yeah, you're right.
[00:44:47.073 --> 00:44:53.537]  Before they were just breaking the law, violating it, but now things are so criminal, they're codifying the tyranny into law.
[00:44:53.597 --> 00:44:54.478]  It's like saying, hey!
[00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:56.921]  I keep using this example because it's the best.
[00:44:57.321 --> 00:44:59.683]  Well, it's the law that black people aren't human beings.
[00:44:59.723 --> 00:45:01.664]  Why, the Supreme Court says they're not human beings.
[00:45:02.065 --> 00:45:05.807]  Why, we can have them, you know, with chains around their necks because it's the law.
[00:45:06.528 --> 00:45:17.295]  You see, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Ten Commandments, the Magna Carta says that if it's in violation of our basic God-given rights, tyrants just can't say we're their slaves.
[00:45:17.935 --> 00:45:19.756]  So, government, you can say I'm your slave.
[00:45:19.836 --> 00:45:20.877]  I'm still a free human being.
[00:45:21.157 --> 00:45:21.998]  You're the criminals.
[00:45:22.788 --> 00:45:24.349]  I mean, Hitler had lots of laws.
[00:45:24.369 --> 00:45:26.791]  It doesn't mean they were right or proper or had to be followed.
[00:45:27.211 --> 00:45:27.832]  It's real simple.
[00:45:28.753 --> 00:45:30.514]  Let's talk to Caroline in Colorado.
[00:45:30.554 --> 00:45:31.575]  Caroline, go ahead.
[00:45:31.595 --> 00:45:32.856]  Hi.
[00:45:32.876 --> 00:45:39.561]  I was listening yesterday when you were talking about that guy who researched the mind control.
[00:45:40.482 --> 00:45:51.330]  And he, along the way, mentioned that running sounds or speaking backwards has some sort of effect.
[00:45:51.772 --> 00:45:56.677]  Well, that was Dr. Boir, and he's a top expert in this.
[00:45:56.717 --> 00:45:59.160]  He was in the News Scientist reporting on it.
[00:46:00.578 --> 00:46:07.819]  And already in Tokyo, as you heard, they have Coke machines that beam sound just to you, directly to your skull.
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:13.561]  And now with face scanning technology attached, it's messages tailored just to you by name.
[00:46:14.041 --> 00:46:17.521]  And I had the CEO on of the company three years ago.
[00:46:17.961 --> 00:46:19.622]  They planned to put it in in the U.S.
[00:46:19.662 --> 00:46:23.342]  They tested it at a few stores, and people got really mad about it.
[00:46:24.043 --> 00:46:25.823]  But that's just one of the technologies.
[00:46:26.363 --> 00:46:41.952]  Yeah, I was thinking about something else you had said a few weeks ago about the Beatles, and I was remembering how they did that in a lot of their music, and also that you had said that they were connected with some sort of mind control institute or something?
[00:46:41.972 --> 00:46:43.813]  Yeah, the Tavistock Institute.
[00:46:43.873 --> 00:46:44.754]  How do you spell that?
[00:46:44.854 --> 00:46:45.574]  I was trying to look it up.
[00:46:45.594 --> 00:46:49.177]  I don't have the spelling in front of me, but Tavistock.
[00:46:49.417 --> 00:46:51.998]  T-A-V something, Tavistock, okay.
[00:46:52.018 --> 00:46:52.899]  Okay.
[00:46:53.835 --> 00:46:54.776]  Do you know?
[00:46:54.796 --> 00:46:56.436]  Was that something that they were doing?
[00:46:56.537 --> 00:47:04.821]  All we know is that the formation and the control of the Beatles is directly linked through their managers and others to Tavistock.
[00:47:05.761 --> 00:47:06.022]  Okay.
[00:47:06.042 --> 00:47:06.882]  That's all we know.
[00:47:06.902 --> 00:47:08.783]  I mean, I don't get into the speculation.
[00:47:08.843 --> 00:47:14.326]  We know there's a connection to the admitted public British mine control facility.
[00:47:14.566 --> 00:47:16.747]  That's a mine control facility, Tavistock?
[00:47:17.228 --> 00:47:19.909]  It's the premier one that we know of that's public.
[00:47:20.951 --> 00:47:26.943]  I have to re-evaluate everything in my world every day after I listen to you.
[00:47:27.424 --> 00:47:29.068]  This world is not what I thought it used to be.
[00:47:29.088 --> 00:47:31.413]  Now you have to know that right before they killed John Lennon,
[00:47:32.122 --> 00:47:39.104]  And I've got a CD of his songs where he talks about the elite sacrificing children, the B-666, the New World Order.
[00:47:39.124 --> 00:47:41.225]  I ought to play those.
[00:47:41.425 --> 00:47:47.627]  And, you know, in his songs he says, yeah, I used to be with you, but now I'm against you, standing up for humanity.
[00:47:47.687 --> 00:47:57.030]  I mean, his last songs were suddenly about God and not being evil and how Satanism is bad and how the elite are in the 666.
[00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:58.310]  Did you ever hear those songs?
[00:47:59.457 --> 00:47:59.697]  No.
[00:48:00.318 --> 00:48:02.179]  Yeah, I've got that CD at my office.
[00:48:02.479 --> 00:48:07.342]  I know that... I'll try to dig that out and play some of those.
[00:48:07.402 --> 00:48:08.323]  Yeah, John Lennon.
[00:48:09.644 --> 00:48:11.265]  And then they sure dealt with him.
[00:48:11.285 --> 00:48:11.825]  Thanks for the call.
[00:48:12.759 --> 00:48:21.988]  And by the way, the guy that killed Lennon, admittedly, was at this weird CIA-controlled third-world refugee camp.
[00:48:22.048 --> 00:48:27.132]  He was an American who'd been at this refugee camp working for years where they now admit congressional testimonies.
[00:48:27.373 --> 00:48:32.717]  They engage in mind-control training, kind of like a Jim Jones operation, and he comes up here and blasts Lennon.
[00:48:33.518 --> 00:48:36.621]  Let's go ahead and talk to Wyatt in Maryland.
[00:48:36.701 --> 00:48:37.602]  Wyatt, go ahead.
[00:48:37.782 --> 00:48:38.563]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[00:48:39.011 --> 00:48:39.591]  Welcome, sir.
[00:48:39.732 --> 00:48:48.657]  Yeah, I live fairly close to BWI Airport, and next to BWI Airport used to be Westinghouse, and now it's Northrop Grumman Defense Contractor.
[00:48:49.278 --> 00:49:04.628]  And, oh, a couple weeks ago, I saw a huge Russian heavy lift pull out of there, and, you know, with the real back, the wings that stretch straight back.
[00:49:04.668 --> 00:49:05.609]  I know it wasn't a U.S.
[00:49:05.689 --> 00:49:06.089]  aircraft.
[00:49:06.784 --> 00:49:12.426]  And then last week, I saw this jet take off, and I said, what kind of jet is that?
[00:49:13.187 --> 00:49:16.948]  And as it streaked across the sky, and it was one of the jet-powered drones.
[00:49:17.649 --> 00:49:23.031]  And man, that thing took off, and you know how you can usually, on a passenger aircraft, you can watch it, follow it, and
[00:49:23.658 --> 00:49:25.119]  As it says, it's picking up speed.
[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:27.981]  This thing was out of sight within like five seconds.
[00:49:28.122 --> 00:49:29.062]  It was unbelievable.
[00:49:29.082 --> 00:49:38.850]  Well, they authorized a year ago drone flights, and the Pentagon said it was domestically to watch the American people to look through our walls with ground-penetrating radar.
[00:49:39.911 --> 00:49:46.176]  But then when people complained, they said, oh no, it's to stop the illegal aliens, which of course it has nothing to do with.
[00:49:47.116 --> 00:49:48.658]  And on top of that...
[00:49:49.854 --> 00:49:52.495]  You mentioned foreign aircraft.
[00:49:53.536 --> 00:49:58.298]  Right after 9-11, six days after, seven days after, excuse me, U.N.
[00:49:58.338 --> 00:49:59.919]  General McKenzie was on nightline.
[00:50:00.659 --> 00:50:04.761]  We've read the transcript here on air, and he said, we need foreign troops here domestically, foreign aircraft.
[00:50:05.542 --> 00:50:07.983]  They had German and French AWACS in our skies.
[00:50:08.383 --> 00:50:09.884]  And then the 56 Norwegian F-16s.
[00:50:09.904 --> 00:50:10.024]  Mm-hmm.
[00:50:12.404 --> 00:50:16.266]  And, you know, our skies are patrolled by foreign aircraft, you name it, drones.
[00:50:16.346 --> 00:50:18.448]  I've seen drones flying above Austin.
[00:50:18.928 --> 00:50:20.069]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[00:50:20.389 --> 00:50:20.889]  That's great.
[00:50:21.429 --> 00:50:30.154]  Also, I work for a car dealership, and one of our finance officers, a fairly young guy, he's from Phoenix, Arizona.
[00:50:30.214 --> 00:50:31.655]  He went back to visit his parents.
[00:50:31.735 --> 00:50:33.256]  He had been away for five years.
[00:50:33.276 --> 00:50:35.297]  Can you hold me over?
[00:50:35.317 --> 00:50:36.878]  Okay.
[00:50:37.198 --> 00:50:39.500]  And he wanted to visit his parents for five years, and...
[00:50:40.307 --> 00:50:44.332]  He goes to the airport in Phoenix, and they lock him up.
[00:50:44.352 --> 00:50:50.438]  When he scanned his driver's license, he had an outstanding speeding ticket.
[00:50:50.458 --> 00:50:51.179]  They put him in jail.
[00:50:51.199 --> 00:50:52.421]  He's been in jail for 20 days.
[00:50:54.002 --> 00:50:54.984]  In fact, you know what?
[00:50:55.004 --> 00:50:56.005]  Thanks for the call, Wyatt.
[00:50:56.065 --> 00:50:58.828]  I'll cover this USA Today article about that when we get back.
[00:51:02.023 --> 00:51:09.408]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:09.688 --> 00:51:14.431]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:14.651 --> 00:51:20.295]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:20.535 --> 00:51:25.059]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:51:25.279 --> 00:51:32.444]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:51:32.464 --> 00:51:36.988]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.148 --> 00:51:39.670]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:46.615]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:09.004]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.264 --> 00:52:13.626]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:13.906 --> 00:52:22.830]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[00:52:26.952 --> 00:52:31.977]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.277 --> 00:52:38.964]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:52:39.474 --> 00:52:40.135]  What about you?

[00:54:08.458 --> 00:54:11.219]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:14.298 --> 00:54:22.124]  Alright, Wyatt was talking about one of his business associates from Maryland flying out to Phoenix to see family.
[00:54:22.144 --> 00:54:35.214]  And when they scanned his driver's license, you know, the script they put on there long before 9-11, getting it all ready for this, the Caps 2 system found that he had a warrant for unpaid parking tickets, so he's been in jail for 20 days.
[00:54:36.555 --> 00:54:39.117]  And I see articles about this every couple days where...
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:42.721]  Somebody's got parking tickets or something.
[00:54:42.741 --> 00:54:44.321]  They get arrested at the airport.
[00:54:46.542 --> 00:54:49.443]  Or you're a conservative or liberal political activist.
[00:54:49.483 --> 00:54:50.744]  You can't fly anymore.
[00:54:50.804 --> 00:54:52.184]  Now they say it's to get on buses.
[00:54:52.604 --> 00:54:55.185]  They want to make you swipe your car to start your car.
[00:54:55.725 --> 00:54:59.046]  They're going to have these robot cones that come out and block your vehicle.
[00:54:59.367 --> 00:55:06.069]  Now that's the new scientist of police checkpoints, hardened checkpoints, built into the roads entering each city.
[00:55:06.869 --> 00:55:08.230]  Total micromanagement.
[00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:09.450]  Total control.
[00:55:10.928 --> 00:55:12.909]  Kill switches going in most of the new vehicles.
[00:55:12.929 --> 00:55:13.769]  That's been in the news.
[00:55:14.669 --> 00:55:18.570]  Computer tracker boxes in all the vehicles, all the new vehicles, last nine years.
[00:55:20.091 --> 00:55:22.151]  This is out of USA Today.
[00:55:22.552 --> 00:55:27.033]  Missouri tracks scoffle laws via pizza delivery databases.
[00:55:27.193 --> 00:55:28.133]  Jefferson City, Missouri.
[00:55:28.573 --> 00:55:32.895]  It's dinner time and you're hungry and tired, so you pick up the phone and order your favorite pizza.
[00:55:33.215 --> 00:55:36.916]  But you might have just landed yourself in a lot more than pepperoni and cheese.
[00:55:37.657 --> 00:55:40.059]  If you owe fines or fees to the courts.
[00:55:40.719 --> 00:55:44.061]  See, it's not for terrorism that they're getting the pizza order records.
[00:55:44.382 --> 00:55:45.182]  It's for everything.
[00:55:45.683 --> 00:55:50.566]  The phone calls may have provided the link the state needed to track you down and make you pay.
[00:55:50.906 --> 00:55:52.647]  This whole article says how wonderful this is.
[00:55:53.088 --> 00:55:54.469]  Total violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:55:55.049 --> 00:56:03.535]  That's one of the strategies affirms it is a company being hired by the Missouri Office of State Courts, it's all part of Matrix, administrator to handle its fine and debt collection.
[00:56:05.123 --> 00:56:13.505]  And it says, a sampling in January of the three of Missouri's 141 counties found that 2 million Obama courts by people social security numbers were known.
[00:56:14.465 --> 00:56:21.907]  And it goes on to say, databases compiled by private companies and government agencies are a key tool for firms such as ACS, Copland said.
[00:56:22.267 --> 00:56:26.368]  And one of the databases they find to be most helpful are pizza delivery databases.
[00:56:27.129 --> 00:56:32.770]  When you call to order a pizza, you usually give your correct name, your correct address, and your correct phone number.
[00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:38.832]  USA Today called all the big pizza chains, and they all denied it and said they don't do it, which, of course, is a lie.
[00:56:39.673 --> 00:56:42.434]  Why do you think grocery stores have loyalty cards?
[00:56:43.234 --> 00:56:43.795]  It's admitted.
[00:56:44.435 --> 00:56:51.598]  Everything you're buying, your psychological makeup off of it, uploaded to Homeland Security long before you heard the term Homeland Security.
[00:56:53.239 --> 00:56:57.661]  And with your new national sales tax they're going to have, you're going to have to swipe your card, and it's total control.
[00:56:58.908 --> 00:56:59.989]  This is the federal plan.
[00:57:00.109 --> 00:57:01.869]  I'll get more into this after the break.
[00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:03.830]  I don't want to just hurry through this.
[00:57:05.511 --> 00:57:07.292]  But again, it's not for terrorists.
[00:57:07.432 --> 00:57:08.312]  It's for everybody.
[00:57:08.793 --> 00:57:10.173]  Haven't paid some parking tickets?
[00:57:10.814 --> 00:57:12.034]  Hey, you order a pizza?
[00:57:12.194 --> 00:57:12.595]  Boom!
[00:57:12.655 --> 00:57:14.575]  Goes right to the cops and they come and arrest you.
[00:57:15.696 --> 00:57:17.137]  You starting to get this, people?
[00:57:17.197 --> 00:57:19.038]  You starting to figure this out?
[00:57:19.078 --> 00:57:20.678]  What the face scanning cameras mean?
[00:57:20.959 --> 00:57:21.939]  What all of this means?
[00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:28.122]  Before we end this broadcast, this hour of the broadcast, second and third hours are coming up,

[00:58:51.354 --> 00:58:54.835]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:58:55.115 --> 00:58:58.616]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:58:58.696 --> 00:59:02.637]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:59:02.857 --> 00:59:09.018]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:59:09.418 --> 00:59:17.340]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:23.102]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:59:23.262 --> 00:59:27.024]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:59:27.384 --> 00:59:29.245]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:59:29.305 --> 00:59:31.466]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:59:31.726 --> 00:59:36.648]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[00:59:46.152 --> 00:59:49.473]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:59:57.755 --> 00:59:58.416]  Big Brother.
[00:59:59.056 --> 01:00:00.136]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:00.836 --> 01:00:01.977]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:01.997 --> 01:00:03.417]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.157 --> 01:00:05.077]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.738 --> 01:00:09.499]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.899 --> 01:00:13.960]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.533 --> 01:00:19.476]  Alright, my friends, we're now into hour number two.
[01:00:21.197 --> 01:00:31.785]  Coming up, biochip featured at Government Health and Human Services Showcase saying how we all need the chip, and that's where UPI got the article about the plans to put it in the homeless.
[01:00:32.466 --> 01:00:33.667]  Yes, it's really happening.
[01:00:33.687 --> 01:00:36.829]  They want to put it in the police, the homeless, the elderly, the children.
[01:00:36.869 --> 01:00:38.010]  Why, it'll save lives.
[01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:40.252]  You're for saving the children, aren't you?
[01:00:42.614 --> 01:00:47.997]  Now top Canadian, even government agencies are admitting incredible levels of depleted uranium.
[01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:50.759]  Very deadly all over Iraq.
[01:00:50.779 --> 01:00:51.539]  We'll get into that.
[01:00:52.460 --> 01:01:01.225]  Before we go back to Dan and Chris and Rob and Vince and Patrick and others that are patiently holding...
[01:01:02.248 --> 01:01:18.995]  I was getting into this USA Today article because a caller from Maryland called in about his friend flying to Phoenix from Maryland and having some parking tickets or some driving violations and getting arrested because when he swiped his ID card, it showed it.
[01:01:19.833 --> 01:01:23.955]  And they've built the cells, and they've got the local police there, and that's all this is about.
[01:01:24.095 --> 01:01:25.435]  It's not about terrorism.
[01:01:25.475 --> 01:01:28.636]  It's about having paid your fines, having paid your fees.
[01:01:29.177 --> 01:01:33.378]  You drive down the highway, Homeland Security's putting in scanner cameras.
[01:01:33.978 --> 01:01:35.179]  They did this three years ago.
[01:01:35.499 --> 01:01:38.580]  We saw it in Indiana, Texas, you name it, but now it's going nationwide.
[01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:46.923]  They scan your license plate that five, six years ago, depending on the state, put in this electronic barcode that you really can't see unless it's in the right light.
[01:01:47.264 --> 01:01:48.224]  They scan that.
[01:01:48.923 --> 01:01:51.464]  It's for a total control grid.
[01:01:51.864 --> 01:01:55.386]  Nothing to do with terrorism, internal checkpoints, you name it.
[01:01:56.687 --> 01:02:00.388]  And USA Today, let me go back over this article, because I kind of sped through it.
[01:02:01.909 --> 01:02:05.791]  Missouri tracks you via pizza delivery database, USA Today.
[01:02:06.371 --> 01:02:10.853]  It's dinner time and you're hungry and tired, so you pick up the phone and order your favorite pizza.
[01:02:11.073 --> 01:02:15.235]  But you might have just landed yourself in a lot more than pepperoni and cheese.
[01:02:15.456 --> 01:02:16.356]  Oh, see, it's so funny.
[01:02:17.176 --> 01:02:24.419]  If you owe fines or fees to the courts, that phone call may have provided the link the state needed to track you down and make you pay.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:31.402]  So again, you call up with a private corporation to get a pizza.
[01:02:31.963 --> 01:02:34.224]  They don't tell you we're going to give this to the police.
[01:02:34.884 --> 01:02:43.848]  And the police go and violate everybody's Fourth Amendment and just buy whole grand databases, treat everybody in the databases as if they're a criminal, until proven innocent.
[01:02:44.654 --> 01:02:47.455]  You ought to sue these people, but see, they won't tell you.
[01:02:47.815 --> 01:02:48.536]  Now, we've caught them.
[01:02:48.556 --> 01:02:51.177]  We've caught the big grocery stores doing this with loyalty cards.
[01:02:52.057 --> 01:02:53.157]  It's so horrible, people.
[01:02:54.578 --> 01:03:00.921]  If you owe fines or fees to the courts, the phone call may have provided the link the state needed to track you down and make you pay.
[01:03:01.521 --> 01:03:07.163]  That's one of the strategies of firms such as a company being hired by the Missouri Office of State Courts.
[01:03:07.203 --> 01:03:11.565]  Again, it's part of Matrix, the multi-state task force.
[01:03:12.085 --> 01:03:13.086]  Nothing to do with terror.
[01:03:13.126 --> 01:03:14.126]  It's all about tracking you.
[01:03:15.586 --> 01:03:24.290]  And it says, David Copland, the state's office budget director, said he discovered the pizza delivery list are one of the best sources such companies use to locate people.
[01:03:25.090 --> 01:03:31.053]  They are literally millions of dollars of uncollected fines, fees, and court costs out there, Copland said.
[01:03:31.153 --> 01:03:31.573]  How much?
[01:03:32.374 --> 01:03:35.775]  A sampling in January of just three of Missouri's 114 counties.
[01:03:36.175 --> 01:03:37.496]  See, it's money they need.
[01:03:38.056 --> 01:03:41.538]  About $2 million owed to courts for people whose social security numbers were known.
[01:03:42.205 --> 01:03:46.929]  Copland said, that finding suggests court statewide could reap significant revenue.
[01:03:46.949 --> 01:03:48.571]  See, it's a positive article about this.
[01:03:49.572 --> 01:03:56.217]  Once the Dallas-based ACS gets to work this month, pursuing people using phone numbers and databases.
[01:03:56.898 --> 01:04:08.168]  Databases compiled by private companies and government agencies are a key tool for firms such as ACS, Copland said, and one of the databases they find to be most helpful are pizza delivery databases.
[01:04:08.962 --> 01:04:13.908]  When you call to order a pizza, you usually give them your correct name, your correct address, and your correct phone number, he said.
[01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:19.014]  Just when pizza companies' databases might be mined is unknown.
[01:04:20.656 --> 01:04:22.298]  Oh, it says just which, not when.
[01:04:22.318 --> 01:04:22.939]  It's already happened.
[01:04:23.339 --> 01:04:25.582]  Pizza companies' databases might be mined is unknown.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.820]  Frozen pizzas are sounding better and better, aren't they?
[01:04:29.401 --> 01:04:38.943]  A representative of Domino's pizzas at the company does not sell its consumer information, and other national pizza chains told about this request did not respond to a message seeking comment.
[01:04:39.523 --> 01:04:45.585]  Michael Daniels, an ACS Division Vice President, declined to reveal exactly which companies' databases ACS uses.
[01:04:47.225 --> 01:04:48.926]  This is all part of the federal takeover.
[01:04:48.966 --> 01:04:49.926]  We'll be back with your call.
[01:04:49.946 --> 01:04:50.346]  Stay with us.
[01:04:53.473 --> 01:04:57.824]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:04:58.004 --> 01:05:02.375]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:05:05.525 --> 01:05:14.354]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:05:14.414 --> 01:05:21.361]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:05:21.481 --> 01:05:23.483]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:05:23.703 --> 01:05:34.267]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:05:34.467 --> 01:05:39.829]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:05:40.349 --> 01:05:43.010]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:05:43.110 --> 01:05:43.731]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:05:43.751 --> 01:05:44.111]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:05:44.131 --> 01:05:45.411]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:54.761]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:05:54.921 --> 01:05:59.043]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:05:59.163 --> 01:06:02.025]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:08.808]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:06:09.008 --> 01:06:12.009]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:06:12.229 --> 01:06:14.590]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:24.894]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[01:06:25.094 --> 01:06:25.574]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:06:25.594 --> 01:06:25.994]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:06:26.034 --> 01:06:27.575]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:06:53.118 --> 01:06:54.099]  It's finally here.
[01:06:54.239 --> 01:06:55.199]  Spring has arrived.
[01:06:55.419 --> 01:06:58.360]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:06:58.601 --> 01:07:02.042]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:07:02.262 --> 01:07:10.406]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the ARC Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[01:07:10.686 --> 01:07:14.408]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[01:07:14.628 --> 01:07:19.630]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[01:07:19.930 --> 01:07:24.435]  Ark's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[01:07:24.615 --> 01:07:28.679]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[01:07:28.779 --> 01:07:35.907]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[01:07:36.207 --> 01:07:41.670]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:45.592]  Call the ARC Institute toll-free at 800-255-1912.
[01:07:45.652 --> 01:07:51.276]  That's 1-800-255-1912 or visit arcinstitute.com today.
[01:07:54.557 --> 01:08:00.581]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:01.201 --> 01:08:04.163]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:07.882 --> 01:08:26.655]  Years ago, we were aware of the fact the National Security Agency, the FBI, the BATF, and many others were actively out there with large chains like Walmart and big grocery stores, you name it, buying data.
[01:08:29.236 --> 01:08:34.240]  And then last year they came out and said, yeah, we call it the matrix system, ha ha ha.
[01:08:35.334 --> 01:08:53.585]  And a bunch of states are involved in it, and we take the police data, the divorce records, the grocery store purchases, all these private databases, when you go to work, how much money is in your bank account, the census questions, and it's all in this big database.
[01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:57.825]  Nothing to do with terrorism, just part of the new America.
[01:08:58.245 --> 01:09:00.766]  You know, ten times the surveillance of the Soviet Union.
[01:09:01.107 --> 01:09:10.431]  But it's good, and the police wear black uniforms and ski masks now, but again, that's another sign of freedom, like that camera and microphone on your little rural road.
[01:09:10.491 --> 01:09:12.151]  You know, it's just part of the goodness.
[01:09:12.591 --> 01:09:18.594]  But the border stays wide open, and the illegal aliens have a waiver where they don't have to get ID cards or a thumb scan to come in.
[01:09:19.719 --> 01:09:22.881]  But you do as a citizen to get a driver's license or ID.
[01:09:23.442 --> 01:09:35.510]  And it says in USA Today, in this little focus on one company and what's happening in Missouri, and it says that ACS out of Dallas gets 20% of the court fee collected.
[01:09:36.551 --> 01:09:44.957]  So they get 20% of the court fees in the people that they scan the database and match it to the police databases and then tell them who to go out and arrest.
[01:09:45.723 --> 01:09:55.631]  And so if you have unpaid parking tickets or moving violations, whatever, they go ahead and report you, and they come and arrest you if they can't find out where you live.
[01:09:57.392 --> 01:09:58.473]  And they scan everybody.
[01:09:58.933 --> 01:10:03.577]  You order a pizza from one of these firms, and again, most of the big firms wouldn't say that they don't do it.
[01:10:03.597 --> 01:10:04.617]  They just say, no comment.
[01:10:05.038 --> 01:10:06.399]  What does that tell you, girls?
[01:10:06.879 --> 01:10:08.020]  What does that tell you, boys?
[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:10.402]  What does that tell you, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:10:11.342 --> 01:10:13.344]  This is very, very sickening.
[01:10:14.492 --> 01:10:21.715]  And it says, the first time your babysitter orders a pizza, the pizza delivery company has your phone number, address, and name, and they sell it, he added.
[01:10:23.916 --> 01:10:24.196]  Yeah.
[01:10:24.516 --> 01:10:30.599]  And by the way, we've had companies request, you know, buy our customer list, which isn't even in a list form.
[01:10:30.619 --> 01:10:32.720]  We don't even keep that more than a few months.
[01:10:33.781 --> 01:10:35.361]  And we just say, no, thank you.
[01:10:35.421 --> 01:10:36.822]  We're not going to do that.
[01:10:37.887 --> 01:10:40.608]  Had the so-called conservative groups contact us.
[01:10:41.048 --> 01:10:46.471]  You know, when you sign up for the NRA, boy, that's when all the junk mail starts hitting you from all the neocon groups.
[01:10:48.032 --> 01:10:51.473]  So I'm here to tell you, my friends, do not be part of this.
[01:10:51.573 --> 01:10:52.674]  Do not go along with this.
[01:10:52.694 --> 01:10:54.354]  You need to start suing these people.
[01:10:56.035 --> 01:10:57.636]  You need to sue them now.
[01:10:59.697 --> 01:11:04.799]  They're just, again, this is totally criminal, totally un-American, right out in the open.
[01:11:05.519 --> 01:11:06.820]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[01:11:07.617 --> 01:11:20.706]  By the way, I remember seeing a USA Today article three years ago where it said that major grocery store chains have face-scanning cameras in them, hidden cameras that scan your eye movement to what you're reading and what you're doing.
[01:11:21.427 --> 01:11:25.709]  A soon-to-be father walks in and stares at the baby aisle from what he looks at.
[01:11:26.170 --> 01:11:33.795]  They then scan his face, compare it to a digital photo in a driver's license database instantly, and then mail him...
[01:11:35.968 --> 01:11:40.411]  A direct marketing male promoting items for his new baby that's coming.
[01:11:41.651 --> 01:12:01.703]  And then this year and last year we find out Walmart has, quote, smart shells with hidden cameras that take a digital photo of your face, match it to the federal database, and then they match it off the RFID and the goods in your cart and videotape the amount of goods you put in, and then that's compared at the counter to what you've got
[01:12:02.558 --> 01:12:21.410]  And then at the end of the day, they have AI computers, artificially intelligent computers already here, and they're just artificially intelligent when it comes to images and tracking, and it tallies up everything, and then they show that to the police, and then you get a SWAT team raid if they think you stole some Gillette razors.
[01:12:22.671 --> 01:12:31.657]  Because, well, we showed you put 15 items in your bag, I mean in your cart, and then when you left the place, there were only 14 items in your shopping bag.
[01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:33.890]  I mean, this is admitted!
[01:12:34.631 --> 01:12:35.391]  This is admitted!
[01:12:35.411 --> 01:12:36.752]  I mean, can you imagine?
[01:12:36.792 --> 01:12:39.153]  It's worse than Minority Report, people!
[01:12:41.033 --> 01:12:49.877]  And the thumb scanners are going in, the check-cashing places, the HEBs, the food stores, and I told the story the other night on Rence's broadcast.
[01:12:49.897 --> 01:12:51.638]  Someone go to your calls.
[01:12:53.058 --> 01:12:54.939]  I said that I boycotted HEB.
[01:12:58.081 --> 01:12:58.881]  And undoubtedly...
[01:13:00.403 --> 01:13:04.807]  HEB has better prices, better selection, is a better chain.
[01:13:05.847 --> 01:13:14.114]  Right here in Texas, my grandmother here in Austin was good friends with Mr. Butts when they went to Baylor.
[01:13:16.536 --> 01:13:17.637]  All this stuff.
[01:13:17.717 --> 01:13:20.679]  Good Texas company, but total New World Order, total Mason's.
[01:13:24.302 --> 01:13:27.806]  But I can't go to HEB because they're in College Station in Houston.
[01:13:27.846 --> 01:13:31.589]  Now they've got signs up for six months in Austin saying we're about to put thumb scanners in.
[01:13:31.609 --> 01:13:34.672]  That's actually in my film, Police State's Retotal.
[01:13:34.712 --> 01:13:41.238]  It's like when I go in and ask them about it, and they admit it's indexed with the state database with your face scan and thumb scan.
[01:13:41.258 --> 01:13:45.722]  Then we have a local newscast where they lie and say it's not, but we have their own employees admitting it.
[01:13:47.939 --> 01:13:49.641]  And so I said, I'm boycotting HEB.
[01:13:49.681 --> 01:13:51.382]  I've been boycotting HEB for two years.
[01:13:51.502 --> 01:13:54.344]  I mean, HEB's closer to my house, better.
[01:13:54.685 --> 01:13:58.087]  So I go to a horrible Safeway spinoff.
[01:13:59.869 --> 01:14:01.390]  And now I can't go there either, I guess.
[01:14:01.450 --> 01:14:04.813]  I'm going to start having to go out in my backyard and hunt squirrels or something.
[01:14:05.113 --> 01:14:06.334]  It's already to that point.
[01:14:07.915 --> 01:14:10.838]  And obviously I'm going to break down and go ahead and go into the beast system and get the food.
[01:14:12.319 --> 01:14:13.360]  We're all facing this.
[01:14:14.682 --> 01:14:19.727]  And I go in, and, you know, a year ago at Randall's, a spinoff of Safeway.
[01:14:19.747 --> 01:14:26.393]  I know Safeway's got kind of a bad name around here, so they just, you know, it's kind of a low-grade deal, rip-off.
[01:14:26.413 --> 01:14:29.255]  A lot more expensive, so they call it Randall's.
[01:14:29.275 --> 01:14:35.060]  About a year ago, I'd go into Randall's, and it'd be, do you have a Randall's card?
[01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:35.401]  No.
[01:14:35.981 --> 01:14:38.343]  Okay, well, you would have saved $5 on your $25 purchase.
[01:14:38.443 --> 01:14:38.764]  Okay, fine.
[01:14:40.968 --> 01:14:41.888]  No, I don't have the card.
[01:14:42.209 --> 01:14:44.709]  A little swipe card they swipe with a barcode.
[01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:51.032]  And now, it doesn't matter if it's one of the young checkout women or the old checkout men, whatever.
[01:14:51.492 --> 01:14:52.472]  They'll go, why don't you have it?
[01:14:53.672 --> 01:14:54.333]  I just don't want it.
[01:14:54.353 --> 01:14:55.113]  Well, you would save $50.
[01:14:55.393 --> 01:14:57.414]  You just bought $150 for the groceries.
[01:14:58.074 --> 01:14:59.174]  Well, I just don't want it.
[01:14:59.194 --> 01:14:59.975]  Well, why not?
[01:15:00.075 --> 01:15:00.595]  You'd save.
[01:15:00.635 --> 01:15:02.916]  I go, lady, why do you think?
[01:15:03.336 --> 01:15:05.056]  Your corporation wants to make money, right?
[01:15:05.116 --> 01:15:05.777]  Well, yes.
[01:15:06.817 --> 01:15:09.658]  Well, why then do you get such discounts to have this card?
[01:15:11.701 --> 01:15:13.944]  She said, huh, you're not one of those conspiracy theorists.
[01:15:14.004 --> 01:15:15.506]  A lot of people come through here like you.
[01:15:16.287 --> 01:15:18.209]  I said, go to nocards.org.
[01:15:18.249 --> 01:15:18.870]  Research this.
[01:15:19.665 --> 01:15:31.029]  I said, this data, it's been in the news by these customer loyalty cards, get sold and passed around, and they build a detailed database on your mindset, on your buying habits.
[01:15:31.069 --> 01:15:33.890]  They then adjust prices for what people are buying.
[01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:42.814]  And some chains, I haven't seen Randall's doing this, they may be doing it, some other chains index it right down to you personally and manipulate it at the counter itself.
[01:15:43.694 --> 01:15:45.375]  I said, why don't you just have low prices?
[01:15:45.395 --> 01:15:48.876]  You know, I can't go to HEB because they're putting in thumb scanners.
[01:15:49.818 --> 01:15:51.619]  And she goes, okay, sir, whatever, whatever.
[01:15:51.639 --> 01:15:56.900]  And I'm like, no, you're sitting here laughing at me, calling me a conspiracy theorist.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  Why do you think they give you these big discounts?
[01:16:00.001 --> 01:16:01.521]  Why do I need a card to do this?
[01:16:01.881 --> 01:16:15.105]  And I said, don't worry, the new national sales tax ID card's coming out, and everybody's going to have to swipe, even if they pay cash, because they're going to say, well, we can't charge the poor people sales tax.
[01:16:15.125 --> 01:16:16.005]  That wouldn't be fair.
[01:16:17.044 --> 01:16:19.685]  So if you make under $18,000 to $22,000 a year, no federal sales tax.
[01:16:19.725 --> 01:16:23.467]  You're just going to have to pay local.
[01:16:24.548 --> 01:16:28.129]  And so it will be broken up with state, county, city, federal, international.
[01:16:28.169 --> 01:16:30.150]  There's going to be even an international tax on there.
[01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:32.991]  So I start preaching at her about the national sales tax.
[01:16:33.452 --> 01:16:36.753]  And there's people behind me in the line going, he's right.
[01:16:36.813 --> 01:16:38.254]  Hey, Alex Jones, he's right.
[01:16:38.994 --> 01:16:40.655]  And then I see some manager walking out.
[01:16:40.875 --> 01:16:43.916]  And so I just say, just put my food in the thing.
[01:16:44.177 --> 01:16:44.937]  I'm getting out of here.
[01:16:46.388 --> 01:16:50.836]  So now I guess I've got to go to the expensive downtown Whole Foods or something.
[01:16:51.838 --> 01:16:53.161]  I haven't been there in years.
[01:16:53.962 --> 01:16:57.810]  I don't know what they're doing there, but here's an example.
[01:16:59.041 --> 01:17:00.742]  Of trying to get around Big Brother.
[01:17:01.062 --> 01:17:03.923]  Getting around Big Brother isn't the answer.
[01:17:04.663 --> 01:17:16.726]  It's getting them to take the infrastructure control systems out, educating people about the Big Brother control grid, and suing these companies and going after these people and exposing this and educating the public.
[01:17:17.806 --> 01:17:19.887]  I have a five-year-old cell phone.
[01:17:20.827 --> 01:17:22.168]  AT&T, Nokia.
[01:17:22.808 --> 01:17:24.248]  So here I am funding the... the...
[01:17:27.742 --> 01:17:33.086]  Oppenheimer's, the diamond merchants, but the point is, you just can't win.
[01:17:33.966 --> 01:17:36.628]  And it doesn't have a satellite tracker chip in it.
[01:17:36.868 --> 01:17:40.470]  Old phones, after October 1, 2001, had to have this in them.
[01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:42.512]  It's admitted, triangulating you down.
[01:17:42.552 --> 01:17:46.914]  It's a GPS tracker chip that pings off the cell towers down to 15 feet.
[01:17:48.435 --> 01:17:51.638]  They can also listen to you over the new phones without the phone even being on.
[01:17:51.698 --> 01:17:52.238]  That's admitted.
[01:17:54.466 --> 01:17:56.468]  And, you know, I tell people about this.
[01:17:56.628 --> 01:17:59.271]  So, I don't have a new cell phone.
[01:17:59.291 --> 01:18:03.035]  Plus, my old one has more power and works better than these new cruddy ones.
[01:18:03.055 --> 01:18:04.977]  Because I've tried the new ones.
[01:18:05.477 --> 01:18:06.939]  Friends of mine that have them, different companies.
[01:18:08.901 --> 01:18:11.023]  But now the keys are wearing out on it.
[01:18:11.103 --> 01:18:13.025]  Now the zero and the one key.
[01:18:14.066 --> 01:18:15.428]  I have to really press them hard.
[01:18:16.148 --> 01:18:17.670]  And I won't be able to get a phone.
[01:18:18.712 --> 01:18:20.433]  I won't be able to get a phone that doesn't have this.
[01:18:20.453 --> 01:18:29.079]  So now it's either take a tracker system, literally the equivalent of a GPS tracker in my car, on my person, or I'm not going to have a cell phone.
[01:18:29.599 --> 01:18:31.581]  And they're getting rid of the pay phones everywhere.
[01:18:31.601 --> 01:18:40.947]  And when I forget my cell phone and try to use a pay phone, most of them only take a calling card now with your name, with your information.
[01:18:42.368 --> 01:18:43.929]  Are you starting to get this, folks?
[01:18:43.949 --> 01:18:47.872]  Are you starting to understand all the new cars have a tracker box in them?
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:52.381]  The states are talking about making you take a satellite tracking plug-in with that.
[01:18:52.701 --> 01:18:55.182]  The infrastructure, the hardware is already in all the new cars.
[01:18:55.822 --> 01:19:02.564]  They're openly, are you starting to get the picture that they're closing the gaps, that it's all coming together now?
[01:19:03.144 --> 01:19:11.246]  Helicopters and drones fly over our cities, looking through our walls with a crisp black and white image of everything we're doing in our home with ground penetrating radar.
[01:19:12.890 --> 01:19:13.691]  This isn't freedom.
[01:19:14.071 --> 01:19:17.814]  Cameras in the school bathrooms and showers all over the country isn't freedom.
[01:19:18.174 --> 01:19:20.436]  School children having to thumb scan to get lunches.
[01:19:20.836 --> 01:19:23.358]  No cash allowed isn't freedom.
[01:19:24.179 --> 01:19:26.861]  RFIDs in the library books isn't freedom.
[01:19:27.262 --> 01:19:32.966]  The FBI going to Borders Books and Barnes and Nobles and demanding the buy list of customers.
[01:19:34.207 --> 01:19:38.811]  Pushing their discount loyalty cards on you to phase out cash.
[01:19:39.611 --> 01:19:43.973]  You see, and now the Federal Reserve says they want to tax you if you use cash.
[01:19:44.314 --> 01:19:49.296]  They're going to devalue cash off the strip in it if you hold on to it and use cash exclusively.
[01:19:50.037 --> 01:19:51.437]  This is the control grid.
[01:19:51.457 --> 01:19:52.658]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[01:19:53.610 --> 01:20:04.335]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:20:04.515 --> 01:20:12.099]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:20:12.359 --> 01:20:15.501]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:20:15.761 --> 01:20:21.503]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:20:21.784 --> 01:20:22.824]  Made of durable Lexan,
[01:20:22.844 --> 01:20:25.704]  Get the Berkey Light, a transparent water filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:20:25.744 --> 01:20:26.665]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:20:52.749 --> 01:20:56.011]  38.
[01:20:53.630 --> 01:20:56.011]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:20:56.251 --> 01:21:00.094]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:21:00.414 --> 01:21:01.234]  Read the labels.
[01:21:01.655 --> 01:21:05.797]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:21:05.997 --> 01:21:10.200]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:15.443]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:21:15.823 --> 01:21:19.405]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:21:19.606 --> 01:21:24.929]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:21:25.209 --> 01:21:27.951]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:21:28.231 --> 01:21:29.152]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:21:53.055 --> 01:21:57.777]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[01:21:58.017 --> 01:22:01.439]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[01:22:01.659 --> 01:22:04.120]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:12.963]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[01:22:13.324 --> 01:22:19.106]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[01:22:19.366 --> 01:22:21.328]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[01:22:21.568 --> 01:22:28.515]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.
[01:22:28.855 --> 01:22:35.322]  Midas Resources is pleased to offer a subscription to the International Forecaster newsletter free of charge with a qualifying order.
[01:22:35.582 --> 01:22:36.062]  That's right.
[01:22:36.162 --> 01:22:42.909]  For a limited time, Midas Resources is offering a one-year subscription to Bob Chapman's powerful newsletter, the International Forecaster.
[01:22:43.149 --> 01:22:47.610]  Call 800-686-2237 for more information or to place your order.
[01:22:47.710 --> 01:22:48.410]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:49.090 --> 01:22:52.511]  Call today and avoid getting soaked tomorrow.
[01:22:52.991 --> 01:22:54.692]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:22:54.792 --> 01:22:57.292]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[01:22:57.472 --> 01:22:58.153]  It feels great.
[01:22:58.333 --> 01:22:59.393]  Absolutely wonderful.
[01:22:59.473 --> 01:23:04.994]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:23:05.314 --> 01:23:06.835]  Kimberly, tell us about your success.
[01:23:07.115 --> 01:23:09.455]  Okay, I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[01:23:09.595 --> 01:23:12.696]  I've lost 16 pounds and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[01:23:12.896 --> 01:23:13.557]  Incredible.
[01:23:13.757 --> 01:23:14.999]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[01:23:15.019 --> 01:23:18.743]  I have a 21-month-old child, and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[01:23:18.823 --> 01:23:19.624]  Well, that's for sure.
[01:23:19.784 --> 01:23:20.365]  Was it easy?
[01:23:20.585 --> 01:23:21.206]  Very easy.
[01:23:21.246 --> 01:23:22.127]  I mean, there's nothing to it.
[01:23:22.147 --> 01:23:27.312]  You can actually still continue to eat meals with your children and not starve yourself or anything else and lose weight.
[01:23:27.773 --> 01:23:31.776]  Remember, mention you heard it right here, and that gets you $25 off a three-month supply.
[01:23:32.137 --> 01:23:33.518]  So call Vim and Vigor today, 1-800-622-THIN.
[01:23:33.598 --> 01:23:34.519]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[01:23:56.070 --> 01:24:02.093]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:24:02.713 --> 01:24:05.715]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:08.436 --> 01:24:12.559]  We're going to your calls directly in one moment and quickly so we can get everybody in.
[01:24:13.779 --> 01:24:16.300]  But there have been rumblings of this for years.
[01:24:17.361 --> 01:24:18.121]  Quote, rumors.
[01:24:18.161 --> 01:24:19.042]  They weren't rumors.
[01:24:19.782 --> 01:24:21.103]  I saw Governor Ridge...
[01:24:22.046 --> 01:24:22.987]  And now they announced it.
[01:24:23.027 --> 01:24:23.267]  It is true.
[01:24:52.784 --> 01:25:02.751]  To have any livestock, ducks, chickens, cows, pigs, sheep, goats, you're going to have to have your own ID number, each animal will, to buy them or sell them.
[01:25:04.192 --> 01:25:04.893]  That's official.
[01:25:05.113 --> 01:25:06.674]  Announced that on Monday.
[01:25:09.396 --> 01:25:10.797]  It's just total control, people.
[01:25:10.977 --> 01:25:12.899]  Total and complete control.
[01:25:13.979 --> 01:25:15.040]  Total control.
[01:25:16.161 --> 01:25:17.061]  This isn't America.
[01:25:18.262 --> 01:25:20.384]  And this was all set up before 9-11, all prepared
[01:25:22.392 --> 01:25:26.115]  But now when you complain, oh, the world has changed now.
[01:25:26.495 --> 01:25:28.097]  They told you that within minutes of the attack.
[01:25:28.197 --> 01:25:29.698]  Oh, things are different now.
[01:25:29.718 --> 01:25:31.540]  Give your freedom up.
[01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:33.241]  Let us be your owners.
[01:25:33.802 --> 01:25:39.426]  Dan in Illinois, then Chris and Rob and Vince and Ted and others.
[01:25:39.626 --> 01:25:40.767]  Go ahead, Dan.
[01:25:41.588 --> 01:25:48.334]  Alex, last night that program where they were showing how the prisoners were being tortured by the U.S.
[01:25:48.354 --> 01:25:48.694]  soldiers,
[01:25:49.389 --> 01:25:50.950]  Yeah, but it's an isolated thing.
[01:25:51.150 --> 01:25:53.071]  Just a few are bad, and we're going to punish them.
[01:25:53.131 --> 01:25:53.411]  No.
[01:25:53.851 --> 01:25:54.251]  No, no, no.
[01:25:54.331 --> 01:25:55.272]  It's system-wide.
[01:25:55.312 --> 01:25:56.832]  They train the troops to do this.
[01:25:57.132 --> 01:25:59.613]  Well, to me, here's the thing.
[01:26:00.054 --> 01:26:04.836]  They know that their neocon-loving Nazi supporters of Bush are not going to be offended by this.
[01:26:05.396 --> 01:26:10.858]  But when they publicize this to the world, Alex, they're infuriating the Arabs.
[01:26:10.978 --> 01:26:13.319]  And that then demonizes America.
[01:26:13.879 --> 01:26:14.920]  Madeleine Albright...
[01:26:15.948 --> 01:26:19.871]  Went on TV and said, we've killed 700,000 Iraqi children.
[01:26:20.271 --> 01:26:20.932]  It's worth it.
[01:26:21.012 --> 01:26:22.073]  It's a good price to pay.
[01:26:22.473 --> 01:26:23.714]  She said that on purpose.
[01:26:23.734 --> 01:26:24.735]  You're absolutely right.
[01:26:24.975 --> 01:26:29.718]  To make the UN look good, to make us look bad, a very sophisticated program.
[01:26:29.999 --> 01:26:33.641]  But I swear, they're not going to be happy until they kill a million people over there.
[01:26:33.661 --> 01:26:36.003]  I mean, to me, they just keep inciting, inciting.
[01:26:36.083 --> 01:26:37.824]  They've already killed 1,500,000.
[01:26:37.864 --> 01:26:40.326]  That's the government's own admission.
[01:26:40.346 --> 01:26:41.347]  700,000 children as of 1998.
[01:26:41.887 --> 01:26:44.549]  I'm talking about in this war, because not just there.
[01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:45.130]  Because...
[01:26:45.595 --> 01:26:53.042]  They're talking about all these Arabs that are getting around the world, they're getting together, the jihad from Europe, from Asia.
[01:26:53.062 --> 01:27:01.830]  Well, that's P20G, Rumsfeld's own Pentagon group, you know, talks about how there really wasn't a real terror threat, but by bombing and killing their families, it actually says this, L.A.
[01:27:01.870 --> 01:27:05.193]  Times, his own documents, then they get people to attack us.
[01:27:05.233 --> 01:27:09.917]  So, yeah, they go up and punch somebody in the face, and when they hit back, they go, oh, you saw what he did.
[01:27:10.137 --> 01:27:11.879]  Right, I mean, look at their level in that.
[01:27:12.179 --> 01:27:13.700]  That town, I can't think of the name of it right now.
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:15.142]  Well, you know, siblings do this.
[01:27:15.382 --> 01:27:24.290]  The 12-year-old, well, punches his 9-year-old brother in the arm, and when his 9-year-old brother hits him, he goes, look, Mom, he hit me, and the 9-year-old gets in trouble.
[01:27:24.530 --> 01:27:26.752]  Well, that's what Israel's been doing for the last 10 years, right?
[01:27:27.532 --> 01:27:28.333]  To the Palestinians.
[01:27:28.353 --> 01:27:32.036]  They keep nudging them, they react, and then they barrel down their own.
[01:27:32.697 --> 01:27:36.040]  I mean, we're becoming Zionists in Iraq, too.
[01:27:36.738 --> 01:27:41.239]  Well, Israel is advising the wonderful policies, but it's a lot bigger than Israel.
[01:27:41.739 --> 01:27:42.700]  I appreciate the call.
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:47.001]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Texas.
[01:27:47.041 --> 01:27:47.701]  Chris, go ahead.
[01:27:49.501 --> 01:27:49.942]  Afternoon.
[01:27:51.122 --> 01:27:51.462]  Hello.
[01:27:51.482 --> 01:27:54.043]  A few subjects.
[01:27:55.983 --> 01:28:01.805]  First one, the 2020 auction off for a baby.
[01:28:02.085 --> 01:28:03.145]  Most disgusting.
[01:28:03.265 --> 01:28:05.186]  And I noticed they've actually pulled 2020 sites
[01:28:07.097 --> 01:28:08.558]  Checking this morning.
[01:28:09.198 --> 01:28:12.800]  Yeah, we had a link to it, and now it went down, but... Yep.
[01:28:14.001 --> 01:28:16.863]  Another thing... Look, look, look.
[01:28:17.323 --> 01:28:31.111]  That's ABC, but notice that the most degenerate programs where women are prostitutes for money, where you get people to cheat on their family, all the dramas, the husband's bad, he's an idiot, the woman runs things, the most socialistic...
[01:28:32.324 --> 01:28:47.727]  Propaganda is Fox TV, but then it's the most conservative news channel, and then even during their regular broadcast of fiction, they scroll weird bush-worshipping news at the bottom.
[01:28:48.547 --> 01:28:53.228]  I mean, it's just total... It's working on the subconscious of the people, see?
[01:28:53.608 --> 01:28:54.008]  Yes, it is.
[01:28:54.048 --> 01:28:54.428]  Go ahead.
[01:28:54.528 --> 01:28:55.369]  I'm sorry for interrupting.
[01:28:55.389 --> 01:28:55.729]  Go ahead.
[01:28:55.809 --> 01:28:56.789]  It's okay.
[01:28:56.889 --> 01:29:00.850]  Then we've got another article from the Mirror in England.
[01:29:02.506 --> 01:29:17.432]  We've got Navy troops refusing to go on subs because they're absolutely in just disrepair after they've been repaired, just hanging to pieces.
[01:29:17.892 --> 01:29:26.396]  They're facing court martial, but they're saying there's 270 safety defects on them, including leaking reactors.
[01:29:29.232 --> 01:29:35.555]  Well, now the government says that radiation is good for you, like the DU, so the troops are bad.
[01:29:35.615 --> 01:29:41.057]  They should lick the nuclear reactors.
[01:29:41.077 --> 01:29:41.817]  They should eat them.
[01:29:43.778 --> 01:29:44.678]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.178 --> 01:29:46.779]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.699 --> 01:29:50.380]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:54.275 --> 01:29:57.259]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:29:57.619 --> 01:30:06.430]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:30:06.770 --> 01:30:11.456]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:30:11.896 --> 01:30:18.619]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:30:19.019 --> 01:30:30.784]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:30:31.284 --> 01:30:35.748]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:30:35.908 --> 01:30:38.370]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:38.390 --> 01:30:40.211]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:30:40.231 --> 01:30:41.492]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:41.512 --> 01:30:42.973]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:30:42.993 --> 01:30:44.034]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:30:53.163 --> 01:30:55.930]  What kind of gift can you give to someone who has everything?
[01:30:56.351 --> 01:30:57.434]  Are you running out of ideas?
[01:30:57.915 --> 01:30:58.517]  Out of time?
[01:30:58.998 --> 01:31:02.186]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?
[01:31:02.867 --> 01:31:03.547]  Just listen.
[01:31:03.567 --> 01:31:04.007]  Just listen.
[01:31:35.447 --> 01:31:40.652]  Birthday coming soon?
[01:31:41.053 --> 01:31:41.733]  Anniversary?
[01:31:42.254 --> 01:31:42.975]  Wedding, perhaps?
[01:31:43.575 --> 01:31:44.516]  Mother's Day's coming up?
[01:31:45.077 --> 01:31:51.804]  Just go to www.songsforever.com That's www.songsforever.com
[01:31:55.504 --> 01:32:00.968]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:32:01.408 --> 01:32:05.631]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:32:05.871 --> 01:32:12.896]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:32:13.297 --> 01:32:19.401]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:32:19.541 --> 01:32:20.742]  There are no side effects.
[01:32:20.942 --> 01:32:21.402]  We're good to go.
[01:32:37.874 --> 01:32:41.016]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies, toll free.
[01:32:41.036 --> 01:32:41.076]  866-885-6625.
[01:32:41.096 --> 01:32:41.336]  866-885-6625.
[01:32:41.356 --> 01:32:42.297]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:32:42.317 --> 01:32:42.577]  Call today.
[01:32:42.637 --> 01:32:44.919]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2.
[01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:46.020]  Back from 9 to midnight central.
[01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:47.040]  We're here, my friends.
[01:33:08.723 --> 01:33:19.811]  Hey, I'll tell you, Chris, I mean, radiation was bad in the past, but the New World Order is so powerful, it's now good to be on subs with reactors that are leaking.
[01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:34.095]  It's good to be breathing depleted uranium at most of our troops' bases at 1,300 times safe levels, the entire country at 300 times safe levels, the entire place basically radiated.
[01:33:34.115 --> 01:33:40.502]  I mean, it doesn't matter if the Army's own training manual says it's going to kill the troops and cause more deformities.
[01:33:41.482 --> 01:33:44.463]  Just, you know, are you with Al-Qaeda or something?
[01:33:45.003 --> 01:33:51.405]  Saying that our government shouldn't be given total control over our lives and that we shouldn't be total jellyfish slaves, Chris?
[01:33:51.925 --> 01:33:53.646]  Well, there's nothing wrong with that, really.
[01:33:53.666 --> 01:33:55.426]  I mean, just watch Fox News.
[01:33:55.486 --> 01:33:56.227]  You know that.
[01:33:56.847 --> 01:33:57.887]  We should all just be slaves.
[01:33:57.907 --> 01:33:58.827]  Are you pro-gun?
[01:33:58.847 --> 01:34:00.948]  What type of commie are you being pro-gun?
[01:34:05.089 --> 01:34:07.470]  It's just a ridiculous state of affairs.
[01:34:07.530 --> 01:34:10.611]  I mean, I'm from England originally and moved over here four years ago
[01:34:11.349 --> 01:34:20.720]  And your video, 9-11, is what woke me up and ever since then I've been preaching the word and getting information out.
[01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:23.683]  It's difficult, especially in South Texas.
[01:34:24.865 --> 01:34:26.006]  A lot of people want to
[01:34:26.863 --> 01:34:28.444]  Just believe that everything's okay.
[01:34:28.604 --> 01:34:29.544]  I'm in a little town.
[01:34:29.624 --> 01:34:30.124]  Hey, then.
[01:34:30.244 --> 01:34:32.325]  Let the face-scanning cameras watch him.
[01:34:32.385 --> 01:34:37.968]  Let everything they buy at the grocery store or at the pizza place be uploaded to the government.
[01:34:38.328 --> 01:34:39.408]  Now, that's freedom, man.
[01:34:39.428 --> 01:34:40.949]  Having the government watch everything you do.
[01:34:41.129 --> 01:34:43.310]  I mean, I'm in Brenham.
[01:34:43.490 --> 01:34:44.730]  I'm sure you know where that place is.
[01:34:44.750 --> 01:34:46.611]  Bluebell Ice Cream, yes.
[01:34:47.532 --> 01:34:48.712]  It's a little town.
[01:34:49.192 --> 01:34:51.433]  We've just got our first camera up.
[01:34:51.974 --> 01:34:55.415]  I mean, this town is a population of nothing.
[01:34:56.458 --> 01:34:57.199]  Basically.
[01:34:57.699 --> 01:35:00.942]  And we've already got our cameras up on the stoplight.
[01:35:01.843 --> 01:35:04.745]  Well, the terrorists might try to go after the ice cream.
[01:35:04.785 --> 01:35:05.586]  Thanks for the call.
[01:35:05.806 --> 01:35:06.066]  Thanks.
[01:35:06.647 --> 01:35:07.487]  I appreciate it.
[01:35:08.308 --> 01:35:10.970]  Let's go ahead and... Mmm, Blue Bell.
[01:35:11.230 --> 01:35:11.351]  Mmm.
[01:35:12.331 --> 01:35:13.312]  That's just what I need.
[01:35:13.332 --> 01:35:15.694]  Some strawberry Blue Bell ice cream.
[01:35:15.754 --> 01:35:16.715]  It's good for my diet.
[01:35:17.516 --> 01:35:20.078]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rob in Wyoming.
[01:35:20.518 --> 01:35:20.999]  Hey, Alex.
[01:35:21.279 --> 01:35:21.799]  Hey, Rob.
[01:35:22.099 --> 01:35:24.842]  Two points, if possible, both to do with PBS.
[01:35:25.909 --> 01:35:46.213]  The first one is the Chief Justice of the Wyoming Supreme Court was interviewed on Cheyenne Wyoming Public Radio last week, and I called in and asked him point blank, do you recognize the natural rights of man, the unalienable, non-waivable rights of man, as compared to the corporation's privilege of existing?
[01:35:46.953 --> 01:35:48.654]  He could not give his assent to that.
[01:35:48.734 --> 01:35:49.874]  It's on tape and I have it.
[01:35:50.518 --> 01:35:51.519]  You ought to send that to me.
[01:35:51.699 --> 01:35:52.560]  I will.
[01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:54.221]  Can't say that we're free human beings.
[01:35:54.961 --> 01:35:57.824]  Living is a privilege, thanks to our God, the government.
[01:35:58.164 --> 01:36:03.988]  Well, he said we've got to do everything the federal government tells us elsewhere on the tape, regards the Patriot Act.
[01:36:04.469 --> 01:36:09.532]  He also said that the state grants you your rights, and that we have to follow the statute.
[01:36:09.552 --> 01:36:13.896]  He said that was an advisory question about whether man had unalienable rights.
[01:36:14.316 --> 01:36:16.017]  Well, government made us.
[01:36:16.117 --> 01:36:16.998]  Government is God.
[01:36:17.098 --> 01:36:18.139]  Government is infallible.
[01:36:19.077 --> 01:36:22.459]  We should drink the fluoride, take the vaccines with the thimerosal.
[01:36:22.779 --> 01:36:25.560]  The troops should thank the government for the depleted uranium.
[01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:31.402]  The black men being allowed to die and spread syphilis for 50 years, I guess that was a good thing.
[01:36:31.722 --> 01:36:32.923]  I guess slavery was good.
[01:36:33.023 --> 01:36:34.183]  I guess Hitler was good.
[01:36:35.224 --> 01:36:40.306]  If the government gives you your rights, if government's God, how could Hitler be wrong?
[01:36:40.326 --> 01:36:43.827]  If government's God, you're not allowed to question government.
[01:36:44.427 --> 01:36:46.088]  Well, it's enough to make you love Big Brother.
[01:36:46.781 --> 01:36:49.221]  Well, you're going to learn to cry and you're going to learn to love him.
[01:36:49.742 --> 01:36:53.662]  I mean, look, every day I see articles where now they're recasting Big Brother.
[01:36:53.962 --> 01:36:54.923]  Big Brother helping.
[01:36:54.983 --> 01:36:56.203]  Big Brother wasn't so bad.
[01:36:56.503 --> 01:36:57.703]  Big Brother to the rescue.
[01:36:58.003 --> 01:36:58.743]  All these articles.
[01:36:58.783 --> 01:37:00.024]  Big Brother likes the children.
[01:37:00.204 --> 01:37:01.064]  Big Brother's good.
[01:37:01.084 --> 01:37:02.144]  It's literally 1984.
[01:37:02.184 --> 01:37:04.144]  Thanks for the call.
[01:37:04.684 --> 01:37:07.505]  So now you tell somebody Big Brother and they go, yeah, I like him.
[01:37:07.605 --> 01:37:08.505]  I like him.
[01:37:08.865 --> 01:37:09.645]  I like him.
[01:37:09.926 --> 01:37:12.266]  How many articles have you seen where Big Brother's helping?
[01:37:13.997 --> 01:37:14.717]  Every day.
[01:37:14.737 --> 01:37:18.758]  I got one today where they're recasting it saying, Big Brother's helping.
[01:37:20.139 --> 01:37:23.140]  Let's go ahead and talk to Vince in Indiana.
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:23.880]  Vince, go ahead.
[01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:24.920]  How are you, Alex?
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:30.582]  You sound like you're fired up today, but listen, you know... Well, because I love Big Brother.
[01:37:30.762 --> 01:37:31.482]  I know you do.
[01:37:31.702 --> 01:37:38.744]  I will need police in black uniforms, beating 95-year-old women, and running around slobbering is good.
[01:37:38.764 --> 01:37:40.305]  I know, but, you know...
[01:37:41.638 --> 01:37:45.359]  Last couple weeks, because you know the price of gasoline has gone up and up and up and up.
[01:37:45.379 --> 01:37:48.719]  And we said it would, and they're going to gouge us more.
[01:37:48.739 --> 01:37:50.140]  Because the cattle like it.
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:53.420]  But me and my buddy at work, we work third shift.
[01:37:54.701 --> 01:37:56.961]  We decided to ride our bikes here the last couple months.
[01:37:58.922 --> 01:38:03.182]  And you know, we've been stopped a couple times by the police.
[01:38:05.463 --> 01:38:10.864]  And so I finally asked, I said, what is your probable cause for stopping us?
[01:38:12.435 --> 01:38:15.936]  This policeman looked at us because he called in another buddy of his.
[01:38:17.837 --> 01:38:19.858]  And I said, what is your probable cause?
[01:38:20.218 --> 01:38:21.999]  We have not committed any crime.
[01:38:22.019 --> 01:38:24.640]  We haven't done anything wrong.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:26.880]  We're going to work.
[01:38:29.301 --> 01:38:31.422]  And I said, we've got reflectors, lights.
[01:38:31.982 --> 01:38:33.703]  Okay, what did he say?
[01:38:33.743 --> 01:38:36.444]  He said, you know, you're interfering with the right-of-way.
[01:38:36.464 --> 01:38:39.345]  We're on the far right-hand side of the road.
[01:38:40.447 --> 01:38:41.788]  And we have our lights on.
[01:38:42.148 --> 01:38:43.569]  We have reflectors on.
[01:38:43.990 --> 01:38:45.151]  We have the vest on.
[01:38:46.392 --> 01:38:51.135]  And, you know, and he goes on to say that, you know, we could take those bikes from you.
[01:38:51.736 --> 01:38:52.036]  I said...
[01:38:52.475 --> 01:38:54.236]  Why would you take those bikes from us?
[01:38:54.596 --> 01:38:57.177]  Well, it's like arresting this 97-year-old woman.
[01:38:57.557 --> 01:39:00.718]  It's all about getting us into the system.
[01:39:01.038 --> 01:39:01.999]  We're all bad.
[01:39:02.079 --> 01:39:08.561]  We're fish to be scooped up by the gods, by our lords, by our makers, by our masters.
[01:39:08.841 --> 01:39:13.443]  Of course, they're not our makers and our gods, but government always sets itself up as that.
[01:39:13.483 --> 01:39:14.063]  Thanks for the call.
[01:39:14.863 --> 01:39:19.285]  Now look, before I go to Ted and Linda and Alan and others...
[01:39:21.047 --> 01:39:23.108]  I want to go through these audio clips real quick.
[01:39:23.948 --> 01:39:32.111]  Now, on prisonplanet.tv and prisonplanet.com and infowars.com, you can watch all these clips for free, listen to all these clips.
[01:39:32.131 --> 01:39:36.372]  The only stuff we charge for is our own productions that we put on the site.
[01:39:36.392 --> 01:39:38.533]  Because we have to because of the bandwidth.
[01:39:38.553 --> 01:39:42.835]  You know, putting a bunch of two- and three-hour videos up there and hour-long reports each week.
[01:39:42.855 --> 01:39:45.055]  So go sign up at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:39:45.076 --> 01:39:46.376]  But I want to do some recapping.
[01:39:47.634 --> 01:40:02.177]  The Associated Press reported that firefighters told the news reporters to get back that they were about to bring Building 7 down, the building that wasn't hit by a plane that collapsed, what, eight hours after the towers 1 and 2 collapsed.
[01:40:03.757 --> 01:40:12.299]  And so we've got that clip from the PBS documentary where Larry Silverstein says that the owner, they gave the order to pull the building.
[01:40:12.939 --> 01:40:13.239]  Okay?
[01:40:14.763 --> 01:40:23.027]  It's the history of rebuilding, so they go back to the day of 9-11, they show the building, and they say, you know, such a loss of life, we made the decision to pull it, we gave the order, watch it fall.
[01:40:23.728 --> 01:40:27.089]  Then I'm going to hear Dan Rather talking about, looks like bombs were in the building.
[01:40:27.449 --> 01:40:29.871]  And we have the firefighters saying this on video too.
[01:40:29.911 --> 01:40:30.611]  That's on the website.
[01:40:31.363 --> 01:40:36.044]  But there's profanity in it, you know, firefighters, so we can't play that here for you.
[01:40:36.064 --> 01:40:37.125]  I guess we could beep it out.
[01:40:37.185 --> 01:40:40.686]  But the point is, this is off national television, the firefighters saying this.
[01:40:40.926 --> 01:40:41.586]  Man the bombs!
[01:40:41.646 --> 01:40:42.286]  Boom, boom, boom!
[01:40:42.887 --> 01:40:44.687]  But here's the Silverstein clip first.
[01:40:44.987 --> 01:40:50.989]  Then we'll air the CBS News 2 Channel 2 piece from the chopper, what they had to say.
[01:40:51.349 --> 01:40:52.529]  Go ahead and hit Silverstein.
[01:40:53.070 --> 01:40:57.471]  World Trade Center 7 had always been considered the starting point for rebuilding.
[01:40:59.355 --> 01:41:07.242]  Located north of the slurry wall, seven had been cleared faster than the rest of the site, and there had been no bodies to recover.
[01:41:11.325 --> 01:41:19.792]  Pelted by debris when the north tower collapsed, seven burned until late afternoon, allowing occupants to evacuate to safety.
[01:41:21.093 --> 01:41:27.238]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander, telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[01:41:28.945 --> 01:41:30.908]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[01:41:32.010 --> 01:41:33.972]  And this is what I was thinking to this poet.
[01:41:34.754 --> 01:41:36.857]  And they made that decision to pull.
[01:41:37.217 --> 01:41:39.481]  And then we watched the building collapse.
[01:41:40.521 --> 01:41:44.643]  They made the decision on the day of 9-11 to pull Building 7 and they watched it collapse.
[01:41:44.663 --> 01:41:48.165]  And we have another clip where the engineer says, pulling means demolishing.
[01:41:48.225 --> 01:41:50.647]  But this next clip is Dan Rather.
[01:41:51.167 --> 01:41:53.568]  Seconds after it collapses, they back the tape up.
[01:41:53.588 --> 01:41:55.089]  You can see him rewinding it on air.
[01:41:55.569 --> 01:41:58.591]  And they play this, and Dan Rather says this about Building 7.
[01:41:58.631 --> 01:41:59.592]  Go ahead and play it.
[01:41:59.712 --> 01:42:01.433]  What you're seeing are high shots.
[01:42:03.274 --> 01:42:07.176]  Now, here we're going to show you a videotape of the collapse itself.
[01:42:07.216 --> 01:42:09.337]  Now we go to videotape the collapse of this building.
[01:42:12.051 --> 01:42:12.611]  It's amazing.
[01:42:13.892 --> 01:42:15.994]  Amazing, incredible, pick your word.
[01:42:16.935 --> 01:42:27.763]  For the third time today, it's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[01:42:28.944 --> 01:42:35.249]  Okay, now here's CBS Channel 2 in New York from their chopper over the building.
[01:42:36.190 --> 01:42:36.911]  Yeah, go ahead and hit it.
[01:42:37.271 --> 01:42:39.152]  The phone from Chopper 2 as he takes these pictures.
[01:42:39.172 --> 01:42:39.392]  Jim?
[01:42:39.632 --> 01:42:41.553]  Yes, I am here, Michael.
[01:42:41.573 --> 01:42:42.934]  Jim, tell us what's happening out there.
[01:42:43.294 --> 01:42:49.697]  We just witnessed some kind of secondary follow-up explosion on the World Trade Center number 2.
[01:42:49.737 --> 01:42:50.538]  Secondary.
[01:42:50.958 --> 01:43:00.823]  It's difficult to make out through the debris and smoke, but it does appear that a portion, the top portion of the building has collapsed down to the streets below.
[01:43:02.985 --> 01:43:04.105]  Go ahead and play that again.
[01:43:04.125 --> 01:43:05.466]  Play that first clip again.
[01:43:06.385 --> 01:43:10.768]  Now, the seismographs picked up multiple explosions, the exact signature of controlled demolitions.
[01:43:35.945 --> 01:43:40.667]  That evacuated the buildings days before, had these weird engineers in there on the very floors that blew up.
[01:43:41.748 --> 01:43:43.449]  The firefighters said bombs were going off.
[01:43:43.489 --> 01:43:44.649]  Some of them even said they saw them.
[01:43:45.310 --> 01:43:48.031]  Now let's go ahead and go to the next clip from the chopper.
[01:43:48.991 --> 01:43:51.372]  If Jim Smith is with us still in Chopper 2, Jimmy, are you there?
[01:43:51.612 --> 01:43:51.852]  What?
[01:43:52.173 --> 01:43:55.074]  Michael, we just saw that as well.
[01:43:55.154 --> 01:44:01.557]  The second tower, the only one that was standing, tower number one, just we saw some kind of explosion.
[01:44:01.577 --> 01:44:10.701]  A lot of smoke come out of the top of the tower, and then it collapsed down onto the streets below, much like we saw the first tower just about a half hour ago.
[01:44:11.730 --> 01:44:13.971]  Now, people try to say, well, that's Tower 1 and 2.
[01:44:14.011 --> 01:44:19.193]  They weren't built right or whatever, even though the engineer that designed it says that he designed it for a jumbo jet to hit it.
[01:44:19.594 --> 01:44:20.914]  Building 7 was hit by nothing.
[01:44:21.274 --> 01:44:26.337]  Catches on fire, has some small fires, blows up, collapses symmetrically, and then they say they blew it up.
[01:44:27.097 --> 01:44:28.758]  So what are you going to do about that?
[01:44:29.158 --> 01:44:30.458]  Are you going to face the facts?
[01:44:31.579 --> 01:44:39.342]  Okay, I've got all this other police state and microchip and Iraq news and economy news with the fuel prices and your calls.
[01:44:39.382 --> 01:44:40.343]  Do we have Jim Shepard?
[01:44:41.972 --> 01:44:42.952]  Okay, go ahead and get Jim for me.
[01:44:42.972 --> 01:44:44.193]  I want to have Jim up for a few minutes.
[01:44:44.213 --> 01:44:44.753]  We'll do that.
[01:44:45.573 --> 01:44:49.915]  Then we'll go straight to your calls and then back into more of this news.
[01:44:49.995 --> 01:44:54.876]  But we got ABC News where they say explosions going off.
[01:44:54.896 --> 01:44:57.437]  We got, again, the firefighters saying get back.
[01:44:57.457 --> 01:44:59.858]  They're about to pull the building, Building 7.
[01:45:00.891 --> 01:45:10.840]  We have Rudolph Giuliani telling ABC News that morning that, oh, we got told to get out of Building 7, that was their command center, because the towers were about to come down, Tower 1 and 2.
[01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:13.162]  An unprecedented event in history.
[01:45:13.743 --> 01:45:20.369]  Never has one steel building collapsed from fire magically for redo on this day.
[01:45:22.130 --> 01:45:24.833]  Jim Shepard, good to have you on the broadcast with us, my friend.
[01:45:25.093 --> 01:45:26.074]  Always a pleasure, Alex.
[01:45:28.194 --> 01:45:29.095]  Alex, how are you today?
[01:45:29.115 --> 01:45:29.495]  Can you hear me?
[01:45:29.515 --> 01:45:30.276]  I'm doing pretty good.
[01:45:30.376 --> 01:45:44.629]  On the water issue, something I believe in, desperately wanting to warn people, the CDC and the FDA have both released reports admitting that Prozac is in many water supplies.
[01:45:45.650 --> 01:45:49.334]  It is causing bizarre brain growths in people, women that take it.
[01:45:50.234 --> 01:45:52.837]  The babies are having weird brain growths, sterility.
[01:45:54.375 --> 01:45:57.196]  It's causing miscarriages, you name it.
[01:45:57.216 --> 01:45:58.956]  That's just one of the things in the water.
[01:46:00.137 --> 01:46:09.439]  Every day I see articles about nickel and mercury and arsenic and herbicide and pesticide and MBTE and the fluoride.
[01:46:10.340 --> 01:46:13.961]  I believe in people filtering their water, not just filtering it, purifying it.
[01:46:14.261 --> 01:46:17.882]  You've got a system made in America, top of the line, that I use.
[01:46:18.142 --> 01:46:18.862]  How do people get it?
[01:46:19.631 --> 01:46:21.672]  Well, and let me just mention something else, Alex.
[01:46:22.033 --> 01:46:24.274]  You know, a lot of people end up getting whipsawed on this.
[01:46:24.374 --> 01:46:28.017]  They think to themselves, I don't want these contaminants in my water.
[01:46:28.097 --> 01:46:32.060]  I'm going to go start drinking distilled water or reverse osmosis water.
[01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:35.322]  And what they don't know is that that kind of water is very acidic.
[01:46:35.382 --> 01:46:36.383]  It has no minerals.
[01:46:36.583 --> 01:46:40.586]  As soon as it gets into your body, it leaches the minerals out of your body, flushes them out.
[01:46:41.126 --> 01:46:48.131]  It also makes your body acidic, which creates an environment for bacteria and virus to thrive.
[01:46:48.895 --> 01:46:52.976]  And what really makes our system different is we do truly purify the water.
[01:46:53.036 --> 01:46:55.737]  We remove the bacteria to non-detectable levels.
[01:46:55.877 --> 01:46:58.278]  We remove the chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[01:46:58.758 --> 01:47:00.099]  We target the bad minerals.
[01:47:00.179 --> 01:47:04.420]  We get those out of there, but we leave in the beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:47:04.980 --> 01:47:07.901]  And we also remove the radiologicals like Radon-222.
[01:47:08.341 --> 01:47:15.824]  So we really clean that water up, make it like nature intended it to be with the beneficial minerals, but without all the nasty stuff.
[01:47:16.641 --> 01:47:29.985]  By the way, if I put tap water in and make ice cubes, because I have an ice maker, but I like to make ice with my Berkey water, if I use tap water, they're cloudy, it's fractured.
[01:47:30.345 --> 01:47:33.006]  You use Berkey water, crystal clean.
[01:47:33.666 --> 01:47:35.726]  You can look through the ice cubes.
[01:47:35.786 --> 01:47:38.027]  Now, why is that happening?
[01:47:39.007 --> 01:47:40.348]  That's interesting.
[01:47:40.608 --> 01:47:44.289]  Boy, I'm going to have to freeze up some ice cubes and pay attention to that.
[01:47:44.429 --> 01:47:45.389]  I had not noticed that.
[01:47:47.707 --> 01:47:49.508]  Basically, it's just more pure.
[01:47:49.528 --> 01:48:02.051]  Anytime that you change, anytime you freeze water or you boil it, you create electrostatic condition, and it will ionize some of the chemicals and make them flock together.
[01:48:02.431 --> 01:48:06.752]  And so that's interesting that you're getting crystal clear water out of there.
[01:48:06.772 --> 01:48:08.713]  You've just got cleaner water.
[01:48:08.733 --> 01:48:09.693]  You've got cleaner ice cubes.
[01:48:10.356 --> 01:48:15.141]  Also, with regular tap water, there will be a white sediment at the bottom of the tray.
[01:48:15.421 --> 01:48:16.162]  I've done a test.
[01:48:16.882 --> 01:48:22.588]  We don't use the ice maker because that's the, you know, we use it for ice chest and stuff, that type of water.
[01:48:22.948 --> 01:48:23.168]  Yes.
[01:48:23.629 --> 01:48:25.430]  But we've done the test.
[01:48:25.450 --> 01:48:28.914]  There's also sediment at the bottom once you take the ice cube out.
[01:48:29.815 --> 01:48:30.455]  That's interesting.
[01:48:30.495 --> 01:48:31.736]  But not with the Berkey.
[01:48:31.997 --> 01:48:35.420]  Yeah, that sediment is just getting filtered out before it ever gets into the ice cubes.
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:38.385]  Folks, look, it's Made in America.
[01:48:38.866 --> 01:48:40.489]  Big sponsor for this broadcast.
[01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:42.493]  They've got several different specials.
[01:48:42.533 --> 01:48:44.437]  When you order a Berkey light without the lights...
[01:48:45.146 --> 01:48:47.767]  A little dude, you know, thousands and thousands and thousands of gallons.
[01:48:48.887 --> 01:48:52.068]  Buy yourself some replacement filters so five years down the road you'll have them.
[01:48:53.048 --> 01:48:54.289]  It's an incredible system.
[01:48:54.329 --> 01:49:01.131]  You get the sheltering in place video by a government expert on chemical, biological, radiological, how to prepare your home.
[01:49:01.611 --> 01:49:07.533]  Or you get the Prudent Places CD with all this information, maps, diagrams, demographics.
[01:49:08.013 --> 01:49:09.794]  Toxic Dumps, Military Bases.
[01:49:09.834 --> 01:49:11.075]  It's a great CD.
[01:49:11.455 --> 01:49:12.575]  You can get either one of those.
[01:49:12.655 --> 01:49:14.036]  Get the Berkey light with the lights.
[01:49:14.076 --> 01:49:17.398]  Get both of those free for $249 or without the lights for $199.
[01:49:17.698 --> 01:49:21.820]  They've got the water bottle special as well.
[01:49:21.940 --> 01:49:28.483]  It's a filtration system, not a purification system, but it makes pond and lake water and creek water safe to drink.
[01:49:28.843 --> 01:49:29.503]  Great system.
[01:49:29.543 --> 01:49:30.964]  Get five of those for $99.
[01:49:31.304 --> 01:49:32.545]  Twelve for $199.
[01:49:32.685 --> 01:49:33.325]  Great deal.
[01:49:33.745 --> 01:49:35.006]  Here's the toll-free number.
[01:49:35.026 --> 01:49:35.066]  1-888-
[01:49:38.814 --> 01:49:40.034]  803.
[01:49:39.214 --> 01:49:40.034]  Jim, give them the number.
[01:49:40.054 --> 01:49:41.015]  888-803-4438.
[01:49:43.837 --> 01:49:46.178]  And Alex, let me just correct you.
[01:49:46.218 --> 01:49:48.680]  I think that you said that the one with the lights is 149.
[01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:49.380]  It's actually 259.
[01:49:51.561 --> 01:49:51.982]  Excuse me.
[01:49:52.522 --> 01:49:54.223]  So it's 259, yes.
[01:49:54.243 --> 01:49:55.744]  259 and 199 without the lights.
[01:49:55.984 --> 01:50:02.408]  And one other thing that I would mention is that this is, bar none, the most economical water...
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:03.160]  Okay.
[01:50:03.180 --> 01:50:03.400]  Absolutely.
[01:50:03.420 --> 01:50:04.180]  Jim, thanks for joining us.
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:04.500]  All right.
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:04.961]  Thank you, sir.
[01:50:05.001 --> 01:50:06.181]  Folks, seriously, I believe in this.

[01:50:35.014 --> 01:50:38.016]  1... Now again, write this number down.
[01:50:38.036 --> 01:50:38.256]  1-888-803-4438.

[01:50:53.726 --> 01:50:58.068]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:58.268 --> 01:51:02.611]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:51:05.808 --> 01:51:08.652]  The New World Order can emerge.
[01:51:10.394 --> 01:51:14.619]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:51:14.679 --> 01:51:21.608]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:51:21.748 --> 01:51:23.751]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:51:24.151 --> 01:51:34.538]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:51:34.738 --> 01:51:40.102]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:51:40.622 --> 01:51:43.244]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[01:51:53.170 --> 01:51:59.415]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:51:59.556 --> 01:52:05.721]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:52:06.001 --> 01:52:14.448]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:52:14.688 --> 01:52:21.714]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:52:22.014 --> 01:52:26.837]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:52:27.037 --> 01:52:32.421]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:52:32.801 --> 01:52:35.883]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:52:36.204 --> 01:52:44.209]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:53:58.524 --> 01:54:00.445]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:54:00.925 --> 01:54:03.766]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:05.006 --> 01:54:07.807]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:54:08.907 --> 01:54:12.048]  Third hour totally jam-packed with your calls and news coming up.
[01:54:12.088 --> 01:54:12.768]  Don't want to miss it.
[01:54:13.328 --> 01:54:14.849]  Right now, let's go right back to the calls.
[01:54:14.889 --> 01:54:15.609]  Thanks for holding.
[01:54:16.129 --> 01:54:17.329]  Ted in New York.
[01:54:17.369 --> 01:54:17.950]  You're on the air.
[01:54:18.010 --> 01:54:18.510]  Welcome, sir.
[01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:19.510]  Hi, Alex.
[01:54:19.550 --> 01:54:22.251]  Wanted to tell your board guy that the phones have been on the hot side.
[01:54:22.971 --> 01:54:23.811]  You know, your voice.
[01:54:25.652 --> 01:54:25.872]  Anyway.
[01:54:26.463 --> 01:54:28.024]  I'm calling about a couple things.
[01:54:28.084 --> 01:54:31.584]  First, I heard your problem with your cell phone.
[01:54:31.624 --> 01:54:32.705]  That can be fixed.
[01:54:34.685 --> 01:54:36.166]  Well, let's recap for people.
[01:54:36.346 --> 01:54:50.810]  All new cell phones after 2001, October 1st, and that was set up as a law in 1996, have a satellite tracker chip in them that triangulates with the cell towers that have GPS on them down to 15 feet.
[01:54:52.130 --> 01:55:04.956]  And this is an example of I have to accept a tracker system that they also admit they're listening to people over if I want to get a new cell phone as my cell phone's punch keys start going bad.
[01:55:04.996 --> 01:55:05.397]  Go ahead.
[01:55:05.957 --> 01:55:12.020]  Yeah, what I was saying about the phone is that the wire phone I'm talking on, that your voice comes through like clipping.
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:13.981]  They've got it cranked up too loud.
[01:55:14.421 --> 01:55:18.543]  As far as your cell phone goes, if they open it up,
[01:55:19.557 --> 01:55:22.019]  This has, like, the elastomeric rubber buttons on it.
[01:55:22.039 --> 01:55:24.400]  Is that right?
[01:55:25.321 --> 01:55:25.581]  Yes.
[01:55:26.182 --> 01:55:26.502]  Okay.
[01:55:27.403 --> 01:55:30.965]  Because I've done this before with remote controls and what have you.
[01:55:31.005 --> 01:55:31.706]  It's easy to do.
[01:55:32.166 --> 01:55:43.014]  If you open that up, if you take some, like, 95% isopropyl alcohol, you can clean the back of the buttons and use a clean pencil eraser, a soft eraser.
[01:55:43.074 --> 01:55:45.796]  You can clean the contacts, and you'll find the thing will work like new again.
[01:55:45.916 --> 01:55:49.078]  Okay, but understand, I brought the story up
[01:55:49.645 --> 01:55:50.686]  Yeah.
[01:55:50.706 --> 01:55:52.707]  In like two years, let me finish.
[01:55:53.308 --> 01:55:56.070]  In two years, this phone won't even be able to get service.
[01:55:56.891 --> 01:56:01.915]  So the point is that they're forcing everyone on to the new tracker phones.
[01:56:02.195 --> 01:56:03.416]  Oh, I see what you're saying.
[01:56:03.636 --> 01:56:13.444]  My whole point is that the old equipment I've got is going bad now, so if I want a phone, I'll have to accept being tracked, and we should have a debate and a discussion about this.
[01:56:14.484 --> 01:56:15.185]  I agree with you.
[01:56:15.425 --> 01:56:16.526]  Because that's not freedom.
[01:56:17.126 --> 01:56:17.707]  No, it's not.
[01:56:18.675 --> 01:56:38.092]  Another thing I wanted to tell you is I had written an article that was published on Rents as a feature article about the coming draft, and it includes much of what has been discussed on your show and the impact of essentially sending our young men and women to their death because they'll pick up a chemical, biological, or depleted uranium poisoning over there.
[01:56:38.993 --> 01:56:44.138]  And I think this is something a lot of people haven't really connected when they think the draft is such a great thing.
[01:56:44.930 --> 01:56:48.134]  We've never had this kind of a threat before to our young men and women.
[01:56:48.234 --> 01:56:53.960]  They admit 1,300% over safe levels, 300% in many other areas.
[01:56:54.421 --> 01:56:55.162]  Very sick.
[01:56:55.202 --> 01:56:55.762]  It's admitted.
[01:56:55.782 --> 01:56:58.165]  And the neocons say support the troops.
[01:56:58.405 --> 01:56:59.246]  Let them die.
[01:56:59.607 --> 01:57:01.048]  Let them have deformed children.
[01:57:01.349 --> 01:57:03.691]  If you stand up for the troops, you're against the troops.
[01:57:04.853 --> 01:57:05.073]  Yeah.
[01:57:06.201 --> 01:57:06.962]  Hey, good to hear from you.
[01:57:06.982 --> 01:57:08.883]  I appreciate the tip on fixing the phone.
[01:57:08.923 --> 01:57:12.626]  But overall, I'm talking about how we're all being pushed onto this system.
[01:57:12.906 --> 01:57:13.447]  Want a car?
[01:57:13.487 --> 01:57:14.147]  Got to be tracked.
[01:57:14.408 --> 01:57:15.068]  Want a cell phone?
[01:57:15.108 --> 01:57:15.729]  Got to be tracked.
[01:57:16.129 --> 01:57:17.310]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[01:57:17.710 --> 01:57:18.491]  Order a pizza?
[01:57:18.851 --> 01:57:20.212]  Information sold to the government.
[01:57:21.413 --> 01:57:22.354]  And this is just the beginning.
[01:57:23.455 --> 01:57:31.161]  Before we go to a final call this hour, go sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv for all of our exclusive special video, audio, and text reports.
[01:57:31.501 --> 01:57:32.822]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:57:32.882 --> 01:57:33.343]  Check it out.
[01:57:34.114 --> 01:57:37.737]  Let's go ahead and talk to Linda.
[01:57:38.698 --> 01:57:39.598]  Linda, you're on the air.
[01:57:39.658 --> 01:57:40.058]  Go ahead.
[01:57:40.079 --> 01:57:40.919]  Hi, Alex.
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:43.621]  Yes, I wanted to ask you a question.
[01:57:43.641 --> 01:57:47.164]  Me and my husband, we drive trucks over the road.
[01:57:47.204 --> 01:57:51.327]  We run California to Florida three trips a month.
[01:57:51.527 --> 01:58:02.875]  And here in the state of Florida, my husband, he stopped at the agricultural because we haul produce inspection stations where they have to check our bills.
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:10.599]  And he noticed there was a machine there, a truck with a machine, got talked to him, and they told him it was a gamma ray machine to run the truck through.
[01:58:11.659 --> 01:58:18.064]  And my husband was telling them about your website and showed them how to get on there, trying to educate these.
[01:58:18.505 --> 01:58:22.128]  Yeah, that's a ground-penetrating radar system looking for drugs.
[01:58:22.808 --> 01:58:23.529]  That's what it is.
[01:58:23.629 --> 01:58:29.133]  I read, I'm worried about this thing because of the gamma rays, you know, and I went on that back.
[01:58:29.153 --> 01:58:35.378]  Well, hey, you know, they admit a chest X-ray is pretty dangerous over time, but this is something that looks right through steel.
[01:58:35.458 --> 01:58:36.439]  It's good for you.
[01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:38.240]  What's wrong with you?
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:39.521]  Radiation is good.
[01:58:39.541 --> 01:58:40.042]  Stay there.
[01:58:40.845 --> 01:58:42.107]  We should eat it every day.
[01:58:45.611 --> 01:58:46.632]  The war on terrorism.
[01:58:46.973 --> 01:58:49.756]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:58:50.036 --> 01:58:54.181]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:58:54.602 --> 01:58:55.443]  So what do you do?
[01:58:55.763 --> 01:59:00.329]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:59:00.809 --> 01:59:02.930]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:59:03.410 --> 01:59:18.115]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:59:18.155 --> 01:59:25.277]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:59:25.577 --> 01:59:28.739]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[01:59:30.279 --> 01:59:30.639]  Big Brother.
[01:59:30.679 --> 01:59:31.059]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:31.079 --> 01:59:31.740]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:32.500]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.568 --> 01:59:57.449]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.469 --> 02:00:02.111]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.311 --> 02:00:06.433]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:06.653 --> 02:00:15.318]  All over the country, they have powerful x-ray systems that they make your vehicles drive through.
[02:00:16.839 --> 02:00:24.683]  And again, there's a reason doctors wear metal armored lead vests, hide behind a lead wall.
[02:00:25.521 --> 02:00:32.084]  Because they're around that radiation every day, and it can build up and increase cancer risk with a powerful x-ray like a chest x-ray.
[02:00:32.704 --> 02:00:40.808]  But these new x-rays look right through inches of steel and aluminum and give images of people, drugs, guns, you name it.
[02:00:40.848 --> 02:00:44.629]  And now the government wants to build hardened checkpoints into all the highways.
[02:00:44.970 --> 02:00:46.470]  They'll pay for it with toll roads.
[02:00:46.490 --> 02:00:47.831]  We'll all drive through these.
[02:00:49.608 --> 02:00:59.050]  It already happens if you're going into Mexico or into Canada, though they don't do it when you're coming out of Mexico to most people, and they waive the illegals from Mexico having to thumb scan, but citizens have to.
[02:00:59.070 --> 02:01:08.793]  And also, another more powerful type of radiation, they are now irradiating nationwide much of the school lunch program poultry and beef.
[02:01:09.762 --> 02:01:10.442]  And pork.
[02:01:10.523 --> 02:01:18.647]  That way they get to build up the industry, radiate and sell you rotten food, killing the bacteria.
[02:01:19.007 --> 02:01:27.812]  You still get the toxin that were in the bacteria as their byproduct, waste product, which is many times worse than the bacteria themselves, so they can feed rotten food to your children.
[02:01:28.513 --> 02:01:31.134]  And now a lot of the food in the grocery stores has been irradiated.
[02:01:31.814 --> 02:01:33.155]  So it's all part of the love.
[02:01:33.475 --> 02:01:34.376]  Linda in Florida...
[02:01:35.671 --> 02:01:40.972]  You were talking about your husband's truck with produce being x-rayed as he drives through the checkpoints.
[02:01:40.992 --> 02:01:41.492]  Go ahead.
[02:01:41.692 --> 02:01:44.653]  Well, I told him I refuse.
[02:01:45.213 --> 02:01:54.915]  I won't drive through it because I went on the machine, the people who build the machine site, and it's a real simple factor.
[02:01:54.975 --> 02:01:57.095]  It said, well, is it harmful to you?
[02:01:57.755 --> 02:02:01.916]  And this is from the manufacturer, and it says it is unlikely.
[02:02:03.037 --> 02:02:17.030]  Oh, no, it's just, I've read the reports, it's just many, many times stronger than an x-ray, a chest x-ray, and you're supposed to wear a lead outfit with that, but this is more powerful, it's good for you.
[02:02:17.050 --> 02:02:21.794]  Well, I'm not real good with radiation that says it puts out five UREMs.
[02:02:21.914 --> 02:02:25.857]  You're not with Al-Qaeda, are you?
[02:02:26.198 --> 02:02:26.538]  Huh?
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:31.247]  They say that questioning the government is Al-Qaeda-ish.
[02:02:31.387 --> 02:02:33.090]  Well, I suppose I must be, then.
[02:02:33.110 --> 02:02:34.853]  No, I'm an American.
[02:02:35.033 --> 02:02:40.824]  You probably think, even though the Army admits that the radiation is killing our troops in Iraq, you're probably against that, aren't you?
[02:02:43.691 --> 02:02:45.232]  How dare you care about the troops?
[02:02:45.272 --> 02:02:46.352]  That's more Al-Qaeda.
[02:02:46.852 --> 02:02:48.293]  Give your rights up, okay?
[02:02:48.353 --> 02:02:49.713]  I'm going to tell you one thing.
[02:02:49.813 --> 02:02:50.773]  Hey, wait a minute.
[02:02:51.173 --> 02:02:52.974]  You ask the government questions?
[02:02:52.994 --> 02:02:56.935]  You go to websites and read about the machines you drive through?
[02:02:57.135 --> 02:03:00.596]  You're not supposed to care about x-ray machines you drive through that look through steel.
[02:03:01.616 --> 02:03:02.496]  No, no, no, no.
[02:03:02.537 --> 02:03:05.117]  You're supposed to... Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.
[02:03:05.437 --> 02:03:07.598]  You're supposed to only care about football.
[02:03:08.263 --> 02:03:10.568]  Well, I guess I'm just messed up.
[02:03:10.628 --> 02:03:12.792]  We're talking to a dangerous lady.
[02:03:12.952 --> 02:03:13.914]  I'm very dangerous.
[02:03:15.157 --> 02:03:19.285]  But I just thought, you know, I just want to tell the truck drivers, refuse.
[02:03:21.064 --> 02:03:21.665]  I refuse.
[02:03:21.885 --> 02:03:22.385]  They can refuse.
[02:03:22.505 --> 02:03:26.389]  I also read an article they're going to make the truck drivers to make sure you're not sleeping.
[02:03:26.409 --> 02:03:28.550]  You're going to have to thumb scan at the truck stops.
[02:03:28.570 --> 02:03:29.771]  Have you heard about them putting that in?
[02:03:30.132 --> 02:03:30.552]  Oh, no.
[02:03:30.912 --> 02:03:31.633]  That's a new one.
[02:03:31.953 --> 02:03:33.074]  Now, they're moving ahead with that.
[02:03:33.174 --> 02:03:40.300]  Instead of a log book, because you could falsify that, you're going to have to thumb scan at certain truck stops to make sure.
[02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:42.102]  Oh, okay.
[02:03:42.222 --> 02:03:43.743]  That sounds like freedom, though, doesn't it?
[02:03:44.164 --> 02:03:45.445]  Yeah, real freedom.
[02:03:45.465 --> 02:03:49.268]  We can haul a load of lettuce from California to...
[02:03:49.810 --> 02:03:50.751]  Well, it's for your safety.
[02:03:50.772 --> 02:03:50.992]  Please.
[02:03:58.332 --> 02:03:59.313]  We'll take care of it.
[02:03:59.653 --> 02:04:01.695]  Yeah, super high-powered x-rays are good.
[02:04:02.415 --> 02:04:02.975]  That's good.
[02:04:03.015 --> 02:04:04.937]  You don't need to wear a lead outfit anymore.
[02:04:05.157 --> 02:04:06.118]  It's actually good for you.
[02:04:06.618 --> 02:04:16.765]  And in a couple years, as citizens, as we all drive under these or are pulled off to the side at the hardened checkpoints to go through them, and you're a pregnant woman and you complain, they'll just beat the living daylights out of you.
[02:04:16.785 --> 02:04:22.749]  I like to do 95-year-old women and, excuse me, 97-year-old women, and you can thank them.
[02:04:23.229 --> 02:04:28.535]  Well, I just want to let everybody know that their food will be irradiated whether they like it or not, Alex.
[02:04:29.376 --> 02:04:31.078]  Well, again, more Al-Qaeda talk.
[02:04:31.118 --> 02:04:31.498]  Thank you.
[02:04:31.558 --> 02:04:32.039]  You know what?
[02:04:32.279 --> 02:04:33.781]  Questioning government is evil.
[02:04:34.722 --> 02:04:36.183]  You must worship government.
[02:04:36.223 --> 02:04:38.726]  You must learn to clear your mind.
[02:04:38.746 --> 02:04:39.867]  Have no questions.
[02:04:40.668 --> 02:04:41.749]  Drink your aspartame.
[02:04:41.769 --> 02:04:42.790]  Drink your fluoride.
[02:04:43.131 --> 02:04:44.172]  Eat your rotten beef.
[02:04:46.306 --> 02:04:47.307]  It's finally here.
[02:04:47.447 --> 02:04:48.427]  Spring has arrived.
[02:04:48.627 --> 02:04:51.568]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:04:51.809 --> 02:04:55.250]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:04:55.470 --> 02:05:03.634]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can too with the help of the ARC Institute's brand new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[02:05:03.894 --> 02:05:07.616]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[02:05:07.836 --> 02:05:12.858]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[02:05:13.118 --> 02:05:17.643]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[02:05:17.823 --> 02:05:21.887]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[02:05:21.987 --> 02:05:29.115]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[02:05:29.395 --> 02:05:34.880]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.

[02:05:50.061 --> 02:05:50.682]  We're good to go.
[02:06:06.262 --> 02:06:11.145]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:06:11.405 --> 02:06:16.048]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:06:16.129 --> 02:06:22.393]  Proofs on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:06:22.433 --> 02:06:24.214]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:06:24.734 --> 02:06:26.836]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.

[02:06:42.488 --> 02:06:44.550]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:06:45.259 --> 02:06:46.840]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:06:47.241 --> 02:06:52.985]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:06:53.225 --> 02:06:58.369]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:06:58.710 --> 02:07:07.977]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:07:08.337 --> 02:07:13.302]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:07:13.622 --> 02:07:17.626]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:07:17.826 --> 02:07:22.630]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:07:22.971 --> 02:07:28.916]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[02:07:29.216 --> 02:07:30.077]  Get the Berkey Light
[02:07:30.197 --> 02:07:38.241]  The standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:07:38.421 --> 02:07:41.603]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[02:07:42.503 --> 02:07:43.624]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:07:45.925 --> 02:07:48.106]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:07:48.666 --> 02:07:51.548]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:56.070 --> 02:07:57.911]  To paraphrase Samuel Adams...
[02:08:00.876 --> 02:08:05.219]  The level of tyranny that you will live under is the exact level you will accept.
[02:08:06.140 --> 02:08:25.756]  So when USA Today comes out with a glowing article, one paragraph out of about 25 that is against it, they go, oh, it's so good when you order a pizza, it gets uploaded to the government, and when you're out at the grocery store doing something, it's all going to the government, it's good, oh, it's so wonderful.
[02:08:26.116 --> 02:08:27.537]  No discussion of the Fourth Amendment.
[02:08:30.160 --> 02:08:31.922]  You see, they're just throwing it in your face.
[02:08:31.942 --> 02:08:35.305]  They just come out and say, we're going to irradiate all the school children's meat now.
[02:08:35.805 --> 02:08:42.951]  It medically breaks up all the enzymes, kills the food, kills the bacteria, but there's still the dead bacteria there eating the toxins.
[02:08:43.752 --> 02:08:44.693]  So it allows them to do that.
[02:08:44.933 --> 02:08:47.676]  We're going to irradiate the food.
[02:08:47.696 --> 02:08:51.319]  We're going to, with a high-power x-ray, make you drive under it all the time.
[02:08:52.586 --> 02:08:54.567]  Oh, we're going to make you thumb scan to get school lunches.
[02:08:54.587 --> 02:08:57.227]  Oh, we're going to make you thumb scan to own livestock.
[02:08:57.247 --> 02:08:59.728]  We're going to make you thumb scan to go to the grocery store.
[02:08:59.768 --> 02:09:04.670]  We're going to have face scanning cameras watching you wherever you are, reporting your activities.
[02:09:05.470 --> 02:09:08.071]  Oh, we're going to draft you and make you serve as a slave.
[02:09:08.131 --> 02:09:15.233]  Oh, we're going to put video cameras in school bathrooms from Canada to Tennessee to London, England.
[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:19.183]  Parents complain, well, you're for the children's safety.
[02:09:19.243 --> 02:09:22.385]  Bad things could happen in the dressing room and in the showers.
[02:09:23.106 --> 02:09:24.868]  You don't think we're bad, do you?
[02:09:24.948 --> 02:09:30.613]  I mean, sure, in 1984 they did this, but actually, Big Brother's good now, we're hearing.
[02:09:32.574 --> 02:09:34.196]  That's why I just want to tear my hair out.
[02:09:35.217 --> 02:09:39.320]  Because this is all so blaring, so out in the open, so ridiculous.
[02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:43.304]  Folks, when your police are wearing black ski masks, you're in tyranny.
[02:09:44.878 --> 02:09:49.803]  When they're covering their identities, when the fastest growing industry is prisons, you're in deep trouble.
[02:09:50.083 --> 02:09:53.767]  We're all in deep trouble.
[02:09:53.787 --> 02:10:02.195]  And now in two years, they've gone from, there's no such thing as a plan to put chips in you, don't listen to the Army War College reports, to every child needs a chip.
[02:10:02.635 --> 02:10:03.937]  Oh, the police need chips.
[02:10:03.997 --> 02:10:05.138]  The homeless need chips.
[02:10:05.458 --> 02:10:06.459]  Chips, chips, chips.
[02:10:06.659 --> 02:10:08.341]  Oh, Hollywood's getting chips.
[02:10:09.205 --> 02:10:10.706]  Prince Harry's getting a chip!
[02:10:11.006 --> 02:10:12.307]  Prince Charles has got one!
[02:10:12.327 --> 02:10:13.688]  Oh, it's a fashion symbol!
[02:10:14.128 --> 02:10:18.031]  Oh, the entire Italian government wants to make their government bureaucrats take it for their safety!
[02:10:18.411 --> 02:10:19.652]  Oh, the troops have to take it!
[02:10:19.972 --> 02:10:22.013]  Oh, microchips under your skin tracking you!
[02:10:22.213 --> 02:10:23.854]  It's such freedom!
[02:10:24.635 --> 02:10:26.636]  Don't listen to the weirdos that are against it!
[02:10:27.557 --> 02:10:28.197]  We're here!
[02:10:28.277 --> 02:10:29.878]  We're in total insanity!
[02:10:33.821 --> 02:10:36.963]  And... I just think about this.
[02:10:37.103 --> 02:10:37.323]  I mean...
[02:10:38.743 --> 02:10:40.605]  People think the government loves them.
[02:10:40.665 --> 02:10:48.372]  It's run by a bunch of control freak psychopaths that actually enjoy dumbing us down, drugging us, toxifying us, everything else.
[02:10:48.472 --> 02:11:02.084]  I mean, the CDC just came out, their own documents, admittedly millions of children have been brain damaged by the thimerosal and vaccines, and suddenly they increased the level in the MMR shot, they increased the level in the flu shot, that's the shot they're promoting.
[02:11:02.771 --> 02:11:07.134]  And the CDC comes out and says, well, it doesn't matter if it's hundreds of times the same level.
[02:11:07.194 --> 02:11:08.615]  Mercury isn't bad for you.
[02:11:10.316 --> 02:11:13.058]  When their own documents are going, man, this is brain-damaging millions.
[02:11:13.298 --> 02:11:14.439]  We've got to cover this up.
[02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:18.522]  You know, it's like the depleted uranium or the irradiating of the food.
[02:11:19.722 --> 02:11:20.403]  Any of this.
[02:11:20.763 --> 02:11:28.268]  Bill Clinton for eight years shipping out tainted blood from Arkansas knowing it had HIV and hepatitis in it, certifying it as good blood.
[02:11:29.369 --> 02:11:31.410]  It's not just that they're making money off all this.
[02:11:31.450 --> 02:11:32.411]  They love it.
[02:11:32.972 --> 02:11:39.473]  They take depleted uranium, which is totally radioactive and deadly, and they go, we're going to put it in munitions and let our troops breathe it.
[02:11:40.173 --> 02:11:41.314]  Oh, this is so wonderful.
[02:11:43.474 --> 02:11:45.574]  And you don't support the troops if you talk about it.
[02:11:45.734 --> 02:11:46.375]  Shut up!
[02:11:46.935 --> 02:11:47.595]  Shut up!
[02:11:48.375 --> 02:11:52.616]  You're a liberal if you talk about Bush is going to sign the assault weapons ban this September.
[02:11:53.116 --> 02:11:53.736]  Shut up!
[02:11:53.776 --> 02:11:55.556]  If you're not for gun control, you're a liberal.
[02:11:57.697 --> 02:11:58.517]  I mean, it's just...
[02:12:00.333 --> 02:12:02.754]  Wall-to-wall insanity.
[02:12:02.774 --> 02:12:05.314]  I mean, this isn't freedom.
[02:12:06.055 --> 02:12:09.996]  And to the police and military and government people, you know, wake up!
[02:12:11.236 --> 02:12:16.057]  You know, we should be able to order a pizza without it being instantly activated to the police department.
[02:12:16.738 --> 02:12:19.538]  Everybody, everything you order being tracked and looked at.
[02:12:20.038 --> 02:12:21.139]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[02:12:21.979 --> 02:12:28.981]  There shouldn't be face-scanning cameras up in my neighborhood and now thousands of microphones in Austin, Texas, Associated Press.
[02:12:29.884 --> 02:12:34.447]  And microphones in Chicago, and microphones in New York, and microphones in little towns.
[02:12:34.647 --> 02:12:42.392]  There's this town in Florida with 321 people putting up over a dozen face-scanning cameras that also scan your license plate.
[02:12:44.593 --> 02:12:46.754]  I mean, it's like a Stephen King nightmare!
[02:12:48.235 --> 02:12:48.335]  Ugh!
[02:12:49.936 --> 02:12:50.717]  Let's go to calls.
[02:12:50.837 --> 02:12:52.538]  I just, I got a ton of news here, too.
[02:12:52.638 --> 02:12:52.898]  I just...
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:55.420]  Oh, my goodness.
[02:12:55.861 --> 02:12:57.962]  Let's go ahead and talk to Alan in Texas.
[02:12:58.102 --> 02:12:58.842]  Alan, go ahead.
[02:12:58.862 --> 02:13:00.022]  Hello, Alex.
[02:13:00.102 --> 02:13:03.604]  It's good to hear you covering some of the same old territory.
[02:13:03.684 --> 02:13:05.265]  It inspires me again.
[02:13:05.285 --> 02:13:13.568]  And you mentioned your display of disapproval of the cameras at Walmart and that you don't go there anymore.
[02:13:14.028 --> 02:13:22.072]  And there are thousands of us, tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of us who also...
[02:13:22.864 --> 02:13:25.807]  Boycott Walmart for those reasons and others.
[02:13:25.947 --> 02:13:28.069]  You also boycott ATB.
[02:13:28.489 --> 02:13:29.390]  You're not the only one.
[02:13:29.430 --> 02:13:30.471]  I just wanted you to let you know.
[02:13:30.491 --> 02:13:32.093]  Yeah, but here's the problem.
[02:13:32.233 --> 02:13:32.974]  Here's the problem.
[02:13:33.654 --> 02:13:43.224]  In 1997, when I really got hot on this issue of biometrics and what I call the cashless society control grid... How long have you been listening, Alan?
[02:13:43.744 --> 02:13:44.285]  Three years.
[02:13:44.905 --> 02:13:45.326]  Okay.
[02:13:45.366 --> 02:13:46.267]  Three years, something in that range.
[02:13:46.347 --> 02:13:46.527]  Okay.
[02:13:48.416 --> 02:13:49.337]  And I'm not bragging.
[02:13:49.377 --> 02:13:52.079]  It's because I read their own government reports and plans.
[02:13:52.099 --> 02:13:53.160]  That's what's so terrifying.
[02:13:53.220 --> 02:13:54.100]  It's all admitted.
[02:13:54.361 --> 02:13:56.142]  Nothing I talk about is speculation.
[02:13:56.202 --> 02:13:56.642]  Rarely.
[02:13:56.863 --> 02:13:58.884]  I'll tell you if it's speculation.
[02:13:59.265 --> 02:14:00.586]  98% is just admitted fact.
[02:14:01.066 --> 02:14:02.547]  Well, you know, the employee... Let me finish.
[02:14:02.587 --> 02:14:03.308]  Here's the problem.
[02:14:03.708 --> 02:14:15.277]  I said that if we didn't boycott now, didn't stop it now, before it went in, it would soon be in everywhere, then the suppliers would be mandated to do it with RFID, and then there'd be no escape.
[02:14:15.377 --> 02:14:16.218]  And we are only...
[02:14:16.938 --> 02:14:31.222]  A year away from everything doing it, and then you literally can't get food, and now they want to make the farmers markets and all of that be under this, and literally, literally, mark of the beast.
[02:14:31.242 --> 02:14:31.683]  Go ahead.
[02:14:31.803 --> 02:14:31.963]  Right.
[02:14:32.083 --> 02:14:43.406]  It may or may not be hopeless, but if there is a chance, it's not going to be by we hundreds of thousands who silently boycott these places if we don't make a voice.
[02:14:43.466 --> 02:14:46.267]  Now, the time I did raise Cain...
[02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:53.102]  In an HEB about the scanning machines, and I let the... First, I started with the cashier.
[02:14:53.162 --> 02:14:56.804]  I said, what do you think about those scanning machines over there?
[02:14:56.824 --> 02:15:01.666]  And she said, if you'd like to make a complaint, sir, please file out the form on the da-da-da-da-da.
[02:15:01.926 --> 02:15:05.867]  And then she looked at me and under her breath said, get the manager over here.
[02:15:06.268 --> 02:15:07.268]  Complain about it.
[02:15:08.268 --> 02:15:10.189]  The people that work there feel threatened.
[02:15:10.249 --> 02:15:14.451]  They don't... Well, they, five years ago, they started putting it in for their employees in the box.
[02:15:14.531 --> 02:15:14.691]  Now...
[02:15:15.382 --> 02:15:22.530]  Then, as I said, as I said, because I was going off their own documents, people go, all the time I get emails, Alan, going, you must be a government agent.
[02:15:22.570 --> 02:15:23.591]  How do you know all this?
[02:15:23.631 --> 02:15:25.534]  How do you predict it?
[02:15:25.574 --> 02:15:34.564]  But because I read about four years ago where the industry had a meeting in Chicago, the telemetrics industry, and they said, they said, look,
[02:15:35.396 --> 02:15:37.697]  First, we'll put in self-checkout with a scan.
[02:15:38.117 --> 02:15:39.738]  Then we'll add thumb scanners to it.
[02:15:39.958 --> 02:15:41.779]  Then we'll phase out all the checkout lanes.
[02:15:41.819 --> 02:15:44.841]  And all we'll need is a security guard and a manager.
[02:15:45.181 --> 02:15:48.623]  And that's why the corporations want us to downsize.
[02:15:48.903 --> 02:15:50.564]  But then everybody does it.
[02:15:50.604 --> 02:15:51.645]  You don't get better prices.
[02:15:51.905 --> 02:15:53.125]  You just get lower service.
[02:15:53.165 --> 02:15:53.906]  See how that works?
[02:15:54.446 --> 02:15:55.987]  And it kills entry-level jobs.
[02:15:56.027 --> 02:15:57.588]  That's real economics, not the system.
[02:15:57.788 --> 02:16:01.230]  But the government wants it for the new national international sales tax.
[02:16:01.270 --> 02:16:02.050]  Go ahead.
[02:16:02.310 --> 02:16:03.891]  So she says, get the manager over here.
[02:16:03.951 --> 02:16:05.151]  Yeah, she said, get the manager.
[02:16:05.171 --> 02:16:06.792]  She said, complain about it, complain about it.
[02:16:06.812 --> 02:16:08.413]  So the employees didn't like this stuff.
[02:16:08.813 --> 02:16:12.514]  I got the manager over there, and I raised Cain, and I did it loudly.
[02:16:12.554 --> 02:16:24.799]  I let everybody in all the lines know that this was dehumanizing, that this was taking jobs from regular people, that food exchange has been a human interaction for millions of years.
[02:16:25.199 --> 02:16:25.799]  Great point.
[02:16:25.819 --> 02:16:29.461]  And to take that from us, it's in our DNA.
[02:16:30.579 --> 02:16:36.202]  It's a human exchange, and to take that from us is one of the most humiliating and dehumanizing.
[02:16:36.483 --> 02:16:38.324]  And I look back, and a lot of people stand there in a line.
[02:16:38.344 --> 02:16:39.404]  They're shaking their head with me.
[02:16:39.444 --> 02:16:41.245]  They're, yeah, yeah, that's right.
[02:16:41.285 --> 02:16:44.607]  So I want to encourage our listeners out there.
[02:16:44.627 --> 02:16:46.408]  Well, listen, that's what happened at Randall's.
[02:16:46.768 --> 02:16:48.329]  But a year ago, they'd leave me alone.
[02:16:48.409 --> 02:16:52.412]  Now they'll start, like a Marine Corps drill sergeant, berating me.
[02:16:52.752 --> 02:16:54.092]  Well, you need to take the car.
[02:16:54.112 --> 02:16:56.114]  Well, don't you want to say, what's wrong with you?
[02:16:56.174 --> 02:16:57.134]  Oh, a conspiracy.
[02:16:57.454 --> 02:16:58.315]  And I'm like, look.
[02:16:59.125 --> 02:17:01.888]  I'm going to pay $50 more because of this.
[02:17:02.188 --> 02:17:09.854]  I should be able to get low prices and not be scammed and have my psychological database uploaded to Homeland Security.
[02:17:10.075 --> 02:17:14.899]  Yeah, they were the first I boycotted, too, but I just think for everyone... Okay, then where are you shopping in Austin?
[02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:18.882]  Where am I supposed to get food, cell phones that aren't tracked?
[02:17:19.162 --> 02:17:20.684]  Where can I live as a free human being?
[02:17:20.864 --> 02:17:21.324]  You're right.
[02:17:21.344 --> 02:17:26.629]  You do pay more money when you go downtown for a lot of that stuff and you hit one of the food co-ops and...
[02:17:27.341 --> 02:17:28.209]  And, I mean, Alex, I'm...
[02:17:29.542 --> 02:17:41.146]  Raising chickens, I'm eating the chickens, I'm eating their eggs, I'm eating... By the way, to own more than two of any animal, any livestock, you're going to have to have an ID number for yourself and an ID number and a special federal license.
[02:17:41.246 --> 02:17:44.308]  Well, that's why we have guns, to protect ourselves from those kinds of intrusions.
[02:17:44.528 --> 02:17:45.468]  More Al-Qaeda talk.
[02:17:45.968 --> 02:17:46.729]  Yeah, right.
[02:17:47.249 --> 02:17:48.109]  What are the guns for?
[02:17:48.349 --> 02:17:49.790]  Well, we should be yelling and screaming.
[02:17:49.850 --> 02:17:58.313]  I just, you know, I mean, to see that when you order a pizza, it's uploaded to these people, I mean... It concerned me that they're exchanging information between the state agencies on these...
[02:18:01.917 --> 02:18:10.720]  All the big companies have been caught selling data, selling information.
[02:18:10.780 --> 02:18:12.120]  I mean, it's across the board.
[02:18:13.380 --> 02:18:14.821]  It's called the matrix system.
[02:18:14.861 --> 02:18:16.141]  It's private and public.
[02:18:16.801 --> 02:18:19.102]  Governmental and private databases all integrated.
[02:18:19.202 --> 02:18:22.603]  Yeah, we need to be sure we don't get too complacent just sitting here on our duff zone.
[02:18:22.643 --> 02:18:28.085]  For every mindless yuppie and foreigner that's standing there in the line happily punching his number into these machines...
[02:18:28.803 --> 02:18:34.685]  We need to have 10 of us that are sending out the cards, writing the letters, and one letter is worth 100 emails.
[02:18:35.006 --> 02:18:40.048]  But see, once they force the food co-ops to switch over, then they've got us.
[02:18:40.648 --> 02:18:42.769]  Yeah.
[02:18:42.949 --> 02:18:48.151]  Yeah, well, like I said, it may or may not be hopeless, but it's only going to be through our inaction that we lose all hope.
[02:18:48.979 --> 02:18:54.482]  Well, I mean, you know, you try to fly now, and you've got a parking ticket, and they arrest you as part of the terrorism system.
[02:18:54.842 --> 02:18:57.363]  Now that's going to be to get on buses, to start your car.
[02:18:58.083 --> 02:18:59.804]  Toyota's coming out with smart cars.
[02:18:59.864 --> 02:19:09.229]  Well, you know, we're a creative and an ingenious set of American society, and we've always had a way of creating and inventing techniques and ways to do just about anything.
[02:19:09.249 --> 02:19:10.950]  And by God, if there's a little bit of J.B.
[02:19:11.010 --> 02:19:16.012]  Weld on my car, as it goes into one of those machines, and half the car comes off and gets stuck in there...
[02:19:16.496 --> 02:19:19.237]  And that starts happening 500 times a day all over the country.
[02:19:19.257 --> 02:19:20.978]  They might want to change their mind about that machine.
[02:19:23.499 --> 02:19:23.619]  Oh.
[02:19:24.799 --> 02:19:25.920]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[02:19:28.501 --> 02:19:30.822]  Very Al-Qaeda-ish.
[02:19:32.162 --> 02:19:33.663]  Very Al-Qaeda-ish.
[02:19:33.803 --> 02:19:35.603]  He's not going to be the slave.
[02:19:35.663 --> 02:19:36.484]  He's bad.
[02:19:37.064 --> 02:19:40.325]  He's against America because he doesn't want to kill America.
[02:19:41.025 --> 02:19:42.146]  He's mad.
[02:19:46.189 --> 02:19:47.110]  We're good to go.
[02:20:08.210 --> 02:20:10.691]  Now is the time to begin preparing for such threats.
[02:20:10.991 --> 02:20:15.733]  Ready Reserve Foods has been helping businesses, government, and individuals for over 32 years.
[02:20:15.994 --> 02:20:25.858]  No matter what your preparation needs, Ready Reserve Foods offers virtually the finest in dehydrated, nitrogen-packed, long-term storable foods and has food units to fit your particular needs.

[02:20:32.705 --> 02:20:34.026]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:20:47.890 --> 02:20:53.395]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:20:53.815 --> 02:20:58.038]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:20:58.279 --> 02:21:05.324]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:21:05.685 --> 02:21:11.810]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:21:11.950 --> 02:21:13.171]  There are no side effects.
[02:21:13.291 --> 02:21:15.512]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:21:30.280 --> 02:21:33.402]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies, toll free.
[02:21:33.422 --> 02:21:33.462]  866-885-6625.
[02:21:33.482 --> 02:21:33.542]  866-885-6625.
[02:21:33.582 --> 02:21:34.703]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:21:34.723 --> 02:21:34.923]  Call today.
[02:21:45.353 --> 02:21:49.177]  Hi, this is Jack Brownrigg with a special offer to listeners of GCN Radio.
[02:21:49.457 --> 02:21:56.424]  Use a Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and a Bill of Rights for your good, not the good of manipulating government agencies.
[02:21:56.704 --> 02:21:58.186]  Take control of your own destiny.
[02:21:58.386 --> 02:22:02.850]  GCN is contracted with Midas Resources for copies of The Citizen's Rulebook.
[02:22:03.030 --> 02:22:04.311]  This is more than a handbook.
[02:22:04.492 --> 02:22:07.795]  It is your guide to a freer life with less governmental interference.
[02:22:08.195 --> 02:22:08.916]  Here's the deal.
[02:22:09.136 --> 02:22:20.390]  Call MRI at 800-686-2237 and obtain two handbooks, one for yourself, one for a friend, and two silver dollars for just $24.95, shipping included.
[02:22:20.630 --> 02:22:26.558]  More than half these coins were melted under the Pittman Act of 1918 and later with a great silver run of the 70s and 80s.
[02:22:27.999 --> 02:22:32.821]  There are less than one of these coins surviving for every 20 persons in the United States.
[02:22:33.141 --> 02:22:37.023]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[02:22:37.403 --> 02:22:39.244]  Ask for the Freedom Handbook Special.
[02:22:39.624 --> 02:22:41.705]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[02:22:43.225 --> 02:22:44.246]  Thank you.
[02:22:45.166 --> 02:22:49.668]  All across America, people are using the sun and wind to create enough energy to power their homes.
[02:22:50.468 --> 02:22:55.170]  For over 18 years, these people have trusted Sunoco to help them on the road to energy independence.
[02:22:55.911 --> 02:22:58.574]  Sunelco has systems to meet every need and budget.
[02:22:59.095 --> 02:23:03.500]  Complete home systems using solar, wind, hydroelectric or hydrogen fuel cells.
[02:23:04.021 --> 02:23:08.566]  With the rise in the cost of electricity, it makes sense to add renewable energy to your home or business.
[02:23:09.122 --> 02:23:13.543]  Many states offer cash rebates and tax breaks to those with renewable energy systems.
[02:23:14.003 --> 02:23:14.443]  It's easy.
[02:23:14.903 --> 02:23:18.864]  Many of Sunelco's systems come packaged for easy installation by the homeowner.
[02:23:19.264 --> 02:23:29.526]  Sunelco has a 106-page renewable energy planning guide and catalog available for only $5 containing a detailed study to help anyone understand the how and why of renewable energy.
[02:23:29.986 --> 02:23:31.986]  May just be the best investment you've ever made.
[02:23:32.466 --> 02:23:34.006]  Call Sunelco today at 1-800-338-6844.
[02:23:37.535 --> 02:23:42.558]  That's 800-338-6844 or visit them online at Sinalco.com.
[02:23:46.601 --> 02:24:02.212]  To all of our AMNF affiliates, shortwave affiliates, internet affiliates, to everybody, to our listeners, to the folks around the show, God bless you all.
[02:24:03.599 --> 02:24:08.582]  Coming up, defectors say North Korean train accident may have been linked to possible plot to murder Kim.
[02:24:08.602 --> 02:24:10.003]  That's finally in the mainstream news.
[02:24:10.163 --> 02:24:12.665]  Oil at its 13-year high amid low U.S.
[02:24:12.725 --> 02:24:13.365]  inventories.
[02:24:13.986 --> 02:24:16.467]  Biochip featured at government health showcase.
[02:24:16.507 --> 02:24:18.008]  Why the homeless all need it.
[02:24:19.189 --> 02:24:20.410]  This is from World Net Daily.
[02:24:21.391 --> 02:24:24.673]  Right now, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[02:24:24.693 --> 02:24:26.374]  We'll get back into the news in the next segment.
[02:24:27.274 --> 02:24:29.636]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in California.
[02:24:30.416 --> 02:24:31.157]  Go ahead, John.
[02:24:32.068 --> 02:24:33.730]  Hey, Alex, I haven't talked to you in a long time.
[02:24:34.250 --> 02:24:34.590]  Welcome.
[02:24:35.511 --> 02:24:36.592]  Oh, I am welcome.
[02:24:36.852 --> 02:24:41.877]  I really feel like I'm with my brothers when I hear them talking on your program and talking to you.
[02:24:42.778 --> 02:24:44.159]  You get me laughing.
[02:24:44.239 --> 02:24:47.562]  Sometimes you get so passionate about what you're talking about.
[02:24:48.022 --> 02:24:50.144]  And I'm the same way.
[02:24:52.186 --> 02:24:56.670]  I love to get in arguments with some of these pointy heads out here in this grand state.
[02:24:57.070 --> 02:24:57.211]  But...
[02:24:58.399 --> 02:24:59.880]  I'd like to ask you a question.
[02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:04.942]  On these RFID chips, is there a possible way that you can deactivate those?
[02:25:05.002 --> 02:25:06.863]  I was thinking of throwing stuff in the microwave.
[02:25:08.003 --> 02:25:20.868]  They've got organizations out here, I think Lowe's, Home Depot, your Walmarts and everything else have gone to these self-checking check lanes in their stores.
[02:25:21.649 --> 02:25:22.309]  Here's the deal.
[02:25:23.860 --> 02:25:28.821]  Well, yeah, and then you basically, they're trying to phase out even the cash at those machines to make you go cashless.
[02:25:29.702 --> 02:25:32.703]  Again, I'm not about getting around these systems.
[02:25:32.823 --> 02:25:37.504]  I'm about exposing them and having them removed before they're fully implemented.
[02:25:37.584 --> 02:25:38.644]  That's where the fight is.
[02:25:38.684 --> 02:25:46.467]  Everybody always, you know, it's like when I got arrested refusing to thumb scan here in Texas, and that's in my first film, America Destroyed by Design.
[02:25:46.487 --> 02:25:48.547]  People said, well, why didn't you just put superglue on your finger?
[02:25:48.907 --> 02:25:50.708]  Then they wouldn't get a proper digital thumbprint.
[02:25:51.838 --> 02:25:56.440]  Look, that's how you individually fight it for your own self.
[02:25:56.500 --> 02:25:58.541]  But we run this country.
[02:25:58.581 --> 02:25:59.381]  We're the bosses.
[02:25:59.461 --> 02:26:02.842]  Contrary to what you think, bureaucrats, we're the bosses, not you.
[02:26:03.162 --> 02:26:05.483]  You're not the authorities or the officials.
[02:26:05.783 --> 02:26:09.965]  We're not the civilians, as you call us in your military dictatorship.
[02:26:10.465 --> 02:26:14.046]  We are the God-given rights of human beings.
[02:26:14.086 --> 02:26:14.947]  We're not your slaves.
[02:26:15.387 --> 02:26:19.108]  We've just got to get the word out.
[02:26:19.288 --> 02:26:20.609]  We've got to get these people to...
[02:26:21.584 --> 02:26:27.568]  Just like a month ago, I was down at Home Depot, and I told those cashiers, the regular cashiers, that this is draconian, what you have in here.
[02:26:28.289 --> 02:26:30.330]  And I'm not going to come to your store anymore.
[02:26:30.370 --> 02:26:33.372]  But when I went down to Lowe's, they had the same deal.
[02:26:34.253 --> 02:26:35.774]  Listen, listen.
[02:26:36.054 --> 02:26:39.977]  They'll first put in three self-checkouts, then four, then five, then six.
[02:26:40.217 --> 02:26:46.461]  Then you'll have ten of them with one person doing checkout, and you'll notice the big lines at the service checkout.
[02:26:46.917 --> 02:26:49.659]  People don't want to use the machines, but they're forcing us onto it.
[02:26:50.119 --> 02:26:51.580]  Then the thumb scanners go in.
[02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:53.341]  This has been the plan all along.
[02:26:53.381 --> 02:26:58.705]  But listen, if you microwave your clothes or whatever, have this, the RFIDs will pop and burn a hole in them.
[02:26:59.105 --> 02:27:02.007]  You've got to demand that they don't put the RFID in it.
[02:27:02.407 --> 02:27:03.288]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:27:03.428 --> 02:27:04.329]  You're absolutely correct.
[02:27:04.349 --> 02:27:05.149]  Hey, good to hear from you.
[02:27:05.169 --> 02:27:06.370]  I appreciate the call, my friend.
[02:27:07.511 --> 02:27:09.672]  Let's go ahead and talk to who's up next here.
[02:27:11.093 --> 02:27:12.454]  William in Florida, go ahead.
[02:27:13.644 --> 02:27:14.424]  Hey, Alex.
[02:27:14.464 --> 02:27:15.765]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:27:15.785 --> 02:27:17.425]  Good listening to you.
[02:27:17.845 --> 02:27:20.446]  I discovered you in the aftermath of 9-11.
[02:27:20.526 --> 02:27:23.527]  I'm just scared and depressed, man.
[02:27:23.587 --> 02:27:25.888]  I need some hope, you know.
[02:27:26.889 --> 02:27:30.430]  I just don't think people are waking up quickly enough, and it's just really scary.
[02:27:30.450 --> 02:27:32.070]  Gosh, I don't know.
[02:27:32.851 --> 02:27:33.811]  Well, I mean, look.
[02:27:34.855 --> 02:27:39.200]  Peter Jennings is never going to tell you that you're doing a good job and that people are waking up.
[02:27:39.260 --> 02:27:42.303]  But let me tell you, I have never seen such an awakening.
[02:27:42.343 --> 02:27:50.752]  I've done over 1,500 radio interviews, liberal, conservative shows, you name it, do interviews every day, and it's night and day.
[02:27:50.852 --> 02:27:53.535]  Five years ago, half the callers disagreed, laughed at me.
[02:27:53.936 --> 02:27:55.838]  Now, one out of 30 callers disagrees.
[02:27:57.822 --> 02:28:01.503]  This show used to have people calling and disagreeing when the show was much smaller.
[02:28:01.963 --> 02:28:02.843]  Now people don't.
[02:28:02.863 --> 02:28:03.884]  I mean, it's almost unheard of.
[02:28:03.944 --> 02:28:04.564]  I wish they would.
[02:28:04.584 --> 02:28:05.564]  We don't even screen the calls.
[02:28:06.344 --> 02:28:11.385]  All these AM and FM stations from Los Angeles to Rhode Island, I mean, where are they?
[02:28:12.246 --> 02:28:14.526]  Because people now know it's all true.
[02:28:14.926 --> 02:28:16.487]  They just don't have a voice.
[02:28:17.787 --> 02:28:20.127]  So it's the illusion that we're the minority.
[02:28:20.487 --> 02:28:21.808]  We're the majority, sir.
[02:28:22.628 --> 02:28:26.589]  And then a lot of the pinheads, as the earlier caller said, the yuppies...
[02:28:27.563 --> 02:28:32.425]  Think they're part of the system, and so they'll laugh at you thinking they're with the majority.
[02:28:32.445 --> 02:28:35.546]  I mean, they'd go with the majority if it said run off the edge of a cliff.
[02:28:36.666 --> 02:28:38.967]  So it's the illusion of the majority.
[02:28:40.147 --> 02:28:45.189]  They project a hologram of the sheep going one way, and we buy it and join up with it.
[02:28:45.209 --> 02:28:52.792]  Yeah, but what happens when you have just that small core of people that are getting more and more and more control as to what's happening now?
[02:28:54.167 --> 02:28:55.388]  You stop going along with it.
[02:28:55.428 --> 02:28:56.709]  You start speaking out against it.
[02:28:56.749 --> 02:28:59.671]  You boycott those putting it in place now and let them know.
[02:29:00.111 --> 02:29:03.413]  They would already have RFID in everything if it wasn't for the boycotts.
[02:29:04.074 --> 02:29:09.198]  HEB planned to put the thumb scanners in in Austin three years ago and kept announcing it but then kept suspending it.
[02:29:09.518 --> 02:29:12.300]  Now in other neocon cities, people are accepting it.
[02:29:13.380 --> 02:29:14.801]  Houston and College Station.
[02:29:15.162 --> 02:29:18.144]  Not in Austin because we've been deprogramming people.
[02:29:19.285 --> 02:29:20.165]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:29:20.686 --> 02:29:21.486]  Keep up the good work.
[02:29:21.626 --> 02:29:21.946]  You bet.
[02:29:21.986 --> 02:29:22.647]  I appreciate the call.
[02:29:24.108 --> 02:29:27.730]  All right, we'll come back and get into some news and then take some more calls.
[02:29:27.750 --> 02:29:28.671]  The toll-free number?
[02:29:28.691 --> 02:29:29.331]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:29:29.371 --> 02:29:30.412]  We're on the march.
[02:29:30.732 --> 02:29:31.733]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:31.813 --> 02:29:34.955]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:45.894 --> 02:29:53.418]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:29:53.698 --> 02:30:04.604]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:30:04.804 --> 02:30:05.184]  We're good to go.
[02:30:21.349 --> 02:30:21.850]  That's right.
[02:30:22.030 --> 02:30:29.157]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:30:29.457 --> 02:30:35.583]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10.
[02:30:36.684 --> 02:30:40.945]  Call a new millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:30:41.105 --> 02:30:45.247]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:30:46.047 --> 02:30:47.568]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:30:47.748 --> 02:30:48.868]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:30:49.048 --> 02:30:52.469]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:30:52.589 --> 02:30:52.989]  Phenome.
[02:30:53.310 --> 02:31:00.392]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:31:00.732 --> 02:31:04.834]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:31:04.954 --> 02:31:05.415]  Fragrance?
[02:31:05.755 --> 02:31:10.518]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:31:10.658 --> 02:31:15.360]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[02:31:15.580 --> 02:31:18.142]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[02:31:18.382 --> 02:31:21.824]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:31:21.944 --> 02:31:25.466]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:31:25.686 --> 02:31:28.048]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:31:28.209 --> 02:31:29.090]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:31:29.210 --> 02:31:38.979]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.
[02:31:39.160 --> 02:31:41.642]  Call Cal Bend toll free, 1-800-340-7091 or visit CalBendPureSoap.com.
[02:31:47.222 --> 02:31:49.264]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[02:31:49.444 --> 02:31:51.086]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot.
[02:31:51.226 --> 02:31:59.213]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[02:31:59.454 --> 02:32:05.900]  Imagine hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini, followed by peaches, mixed fruit, or pineapple for dessert.
[02:32:06.080 --> 02:32:07.321]  Just a few of the many selections.
[02:32:07.521 --> 02:32:10.844]  Visit www.longlifefood.com for a complete menu.
[02:32:11.024 --> 02:32:14.646]  Both FEMA and the Red Cross have suggested having food stored in case of disaster.
[02:32:14.827 --> 02:32:20.351]  The Long Life Food Depot was recently mentioned in the USA Today article on the very subject of emergency preparations.
[02:32:20.651 --> 02:32:23.333]  It makes sense to be prepared and Long Life Food Depot makes it easy.
[02:32:23.553 --> 02:32:27.555]  Long-term storable MREs make for convenience when camping, hiking, or canoeing.
[02:32:27.795 --> 02:32:28.675]  No fires allowed.
[02:32:28.815 --> 02:32:29.815]  Hot meals still are.
[02:32:29.936 --> 02:32:33.977]  Call the Long Life Food Depot toll-free at 800-601-2833.
[02:32:34.197 --> 02:32:36.318]  That's 1-800-601-2833.
[02:32:36.498 --> 02:32:39.139]  Or visit longlifefood.com.
[02:32:39.399 --> 02:32:42.740]  The Long Life Food Depot offers free shipping via UPS ground on every order.
[02:32:42.840 --> 02:32:43.261]  Don't wait.
[02:32:43.401 --> 02:32:45.121]  Call the Long Life Food Depot today.
[02:32:46.322 --> 02:32:48.523]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:32:49.103 --> 02:32:51.864]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:32:56.013 --> 02:33:02.496]  You know, I should have qualified my statement that people never call this show disagreeing.
[02:33:03.417 --> 02:33:12.161]  And again, five years ago they would when I was on five stations, and now I'm on, I don't know, 10, 15 times that, and people don't call in disagreeing.
[02:33:13.201 --> 02:33:16.403]  But when they do call in, it's, I'm not hardcore enough, or...
[02:33:17.957 --> 02:33:20.839]  I don't think it's the Catholic Church secretly running the New World Order.
[02:33:20.939 --> 02:33:21.940]  I'm not Catholic, by the way.
[02:33:21.960 --> 02:33:22.560]  I'm just making that point.
[02:33:22.580 --> 02:33:23.821]  I don't think they run the New World Order.
[02:33:23.841 --> 02:33:24.541]  I think it's part of it.
[02:33:25.042 --> 02:33:26.122]  It's infiltrated everything.
[02:33:26.663 --> 02:33:29.345]  I don't think the Jews run the whole New World Order.
[02:33:29.405 --> 02:33:30.665]  I think Jews are part of it.
[02:33:30.986 --> 02:33:32.527]  So are Germans, everybody else.
[02:33:33.167 --> 02:33:39.391]  Everybody's got their own little subgroup they think is behind it all, when really it's just a bunch of evil people from every group working together.
[02:33:40.712 --> 02:33:49.481]  Or they'll call in and say, you know, you don't talk about the Federal Reserve enough, or you won't bash other patriots and do all that stuff that people love to do so much.
[02:33:50.422 --> 02:33:52.404]  Or I get the call that there's nothing we can do about it.
[02:33:52.424 --> 02:33:53.345]  It's God's plan.
[02:33:53.365 --> 02:33:54.266]  Just go along with it.
[02:33:54.647 --> 02:33:56.509]  Now, this next caller, I talked to him during the break.
[02:33:56.529 --> 02:33:57.109]  He disagrees.
[02:33:57.430 --> 02:34:00.733]  He doesn't really say that, and I agree with a lot of what he's saying.
[02:34:01.394 --> 02:34:03.196]  But if you disagree with me, if you think that,
[02:34:03.891 --> 02:34:07.553]  Well, I saw some liberal on TV yesterday saying there's no New World Order.
[02:34:07.573 --> 02:34:09.835]  You know, conservatives are nuts.
[02:34:09.975 --> 02:34:12.457]  It doesn't exist when presidents and the U.N.
[02:34:12.477 --> 02:34:13.157]  are calling for it.
[02:34:13.617 --> 02:34:15.319]  You know, I'm talking about that type of person.
[02:34:16.639 --> 02:34:18.721]  Or, you know, you think gun control is good.
[02:34:19.321 --> 02:34:20.082]  Give me a call.
[02:34:21.002 --> 02:34:23.044]  Or you think forced inoculations is good.
[02:34:23.124 --> 02:34:24.905]  But really, you don't think it's good, do you?
[02:34:25.165 --> 02:34:32.730]  That's why you heard us all talk about this five, ten years ago, didn't believe it, saw it all happen, and now you know we got credibility.
[02:34:33.303 --> 02:34:36.324]  Because I study this like you study football.
[02:34:36.965 --> 02:34:40.366]  I study this like you study how to strut around acting tough.
[02:34:41.507 --> 02:34:45.689]  Sticking your belly out with a case of beer, bugging your eyes out if anybody looks at you cross.
[02:34:46.889 --> 02:34:48.750]  You know, you're in your own little macho world.
[02:34:48.790 --> 02:34:52.352]  The women are off on their own little dingbat planet.
[02:34:53.292 --> 02:34:56.153]  And, you know, I'm sorry I'm not, folks.
[02:34:56.954 --> 02:35:00.815]  I'm engaged with the world, looking at what's happening, tracking it involved.
[02:35:01.076 --> 02:35:02.056]  And I'm not bragging.
[02:35:02.939 --> 02:35:06.621]  I'm telling you, you better get to be an expert on something real.
[02:35:07.661 --> 02:35:11.483]  We'll go to Rick, who disagrees, or Rich, who disagrees, Dave, Mark, and others.
[02:35:11.883 --> 02:35:13.463]  I'm going to leave a few phone lines open.
[02:35:13.503 --> 02:35:19.406]  Whoever else calls in, in fact, if the lines are already loaded again, just tell the folks we can't talk to them, some of the new callers.
[02:35:20.126 --> 02:35:22.027]  If somebody wants to really disagree with me, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:35:22.047 --> 02:35:22.927]  Now, come on.
[02:35:23.087 --> 02:35:24.788]  Hit me with your best shot.
[02:35:24.948 --> 02:35:25.408]  Fire away.
[02:35:34.338 --> 02:35:35.199]  Go ahead.
[02:35:35.419 --> 02:35:36.520]  Tell me what I'm wrong about.
[02:35:36.580 --> 02:35:36.960]  Come on.
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:37.341]  Come on.
[02:35:37.381 --> 02:35:37.781]  Come on.
[02:35:38.242 --> 02:35:39.443]  I can defend my ideas.
[02:35:39.483 --> 02:35:44.607]  These neocons, these ultra-liberal talk shows posing as conservatives will screen you out.
[02:35:45.708 --> 02:35:46.069]  Okay?
[02:35:46.529 --> 02:35:47.090]  I don't do that.
[02:35:47.210 --> 02:35:47.850]  I don't have to.
[02:35:48.150 --> 02:35:49.552]  I can defend my ideas.
[02:35:49.752 --> 02:35:51.093]  I know what I'm talking about.
[02:35:51.473 --> 02:35:52.935]  Unfortunately, I wish I was wrong.
[02:35:54.136 --> 02:35:59.581]  Before I go to these calls, because somebody disagrees, I'll go to him first, then into this news, then into others if they disagree.
[02:36:01.143 --> 02:36:04.225]  I've done a couple puny plugs for my videos today.
[02:36:04.325 --> 02:36:06.026]  I mean, how do I get you to order these?
[02:36:07.187 --> 02:36:08.488]  They're professionally produced.
[02:36:08.508 --> 02:36:09.368]  They're scary.
[02:36:09.729 --> 02:36:11.049]  They're waking people up.
[02:36:11.650 --> 02:36:13.531]  90% of those that see the videos are waking up.
[02:36:13.931 --> 02:36:16.853]  We're exposing the murderers who really carry out 9-11.
[02:36:17.453 --> 02:36:23.497]  You need to have 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Part 2 of that, The Masters of Terror Exposed, both videos over two hours.
[02:36:24.192 --> 02:36:30.436]  You need to have my book, 9-11 Descent into Tyranny, Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and the New World Order.
[02:36:30.456 --> 02:36:36.641]  You need to have my video, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, where we conquer satanic rituals on video, the world leaders.
[02:36:36.661 --> 02:36:39.683]  You need to have America Destroyed by Design.
[02:36:39.703 --> 02:36:44.246]  You need to have Police State 2000, Police State 2, The Takeover, Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[02:36:44.666 --> 02:36:45.127]  They're all $25.95.
[02:36:45.847 --> 02:36:51.091]  $20 if you order three or more of any of the ten titles.
[02:36:51.696 --> 02:36:55.898]  I also carry other great videos and books and books on tape and CD.
[02:36:56.478 --> 02:37:03.921]  The best stuff I've found out there is available through InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:37:04.141 --> 02:37:05.242]  So order today.
[02:37:05.762 --> 02:37:06.802]  Take action today.
[02:37:07.943 --> 02:37:09.823]  Or you can also simply call us at 1-888-253-3139.
[02:37:19.201 --> 02:37:22.084]  And you can ask the operators questions about the videos, whatever, and order them.
[02:37:22.104 --> 02:37:22.985]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:37:23.005 --> 02:37:24.706]  Or just write to me.
[02:37:24.987 --> 02:37:27.269]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:37:27.529 --> 02:37:30.011]  And yes, last but not least, we have launched PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:37:30.051 --> 02:37:31.873]  We launched it a week ago.
[02:37:45.746 --> 02:37:47.586]  Already a lot of people signed up.
[02:37:47.766 --> 02:38:04.809]  It's $0.15 a day if you buy a year subscription, $0.19 a day if you buy a monthly subscription, full of audio reports, video reports, text reports, multiple reports weekly, and it's going to get bigger and bigger.
[02:38:05.650 --> 02:38:06.830]  And you also support us.
[02:38:06.850 --> 02:38:13.031]  The reason we had to do this is because when you get 20 million visitors a month and you've got three big servers and one little server,
[02:38:14.426 --> 02:38:15.568]  And they're all maxed out.
[02:38:17.131 --> 02:38:19.396]  We just can't have an interactive site and pay for it.
[02:38:19.576 --> 02:38:25.227]  The video gets very expensive when a million people in a week watch a video, especially a two-hour long video.
[02:38:26.452 --> 02:38:30.313]  So go to prisonplanet.tv and support what we're doing and get access to something great.
[02:38:30.893 --> 02:38:35.775]  A cup of coffee costs you a dollar if it's cheap, two, three bucks if it's Starbucks.
[02:38:36.295 --> 02:38:40.556]  You can spend 15 to 19 cents a day and support us at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:38:40.576 --> 02:38:50.359]  You can order by credit card on there, safe and secure, certified secure site, or you can use the PayPal feature.
[02:38:51.019 --> 02:38:52.840]  Okay, let's go ahead...
[02:38:54.054 --> 02:38:58.636]  And go to Rich in Colorado who disagrees with me.
[02:38:58.696 --> 02:38:59.657]  Go ahead, Rich.
[02:39:00.337 --> 02:39:06.100]  Alex, there is a new world order upon us, and it is not of a certain group of man.
[02:39:06.300 --> 02:39:14.685]  It is from Satan, and it is part of God's plan in the last generation, the generation of the fig tree of which we are in.
[02:39:15.305 --> 02:39:21.248]  And there is nothing that any of us can do about it unless we think we're tougher than God and can stop His plan.
[02:39:21.770 --> 02:39:23.351]  Okay, can I say something now?
[02:39:23.371 --> 02:39:23.771]  Your turn.
[02:39:52.037 --> 02:39:52.317]  Okay.
[02:39:54.097 --> 02:39:57.518]  So from your interpretation of my broadcast, you think I disagree with you?
[02:39:59.219 --> 02:39:59.819]  No, I do not.
[02:40:00.539 --> 02:40:04.520]  Sometimes you get off on saying that we're going to stop the New World Order.
[02:40:05.020 --> 02:40:05.260]  Okay.
[02:40:05.280 --> 02:40:06.280]  That's what I disagree with.
[02:40:06.300 --> 02:40:07.381]  Okay, I'm going to stop you right there.
[02:40:07.401 --> 02:40:08.081]  Okay.
[02:40:08.981 --> 02:40:14.062]  Christ told us, the Bible told us over and over again, no man knows the hour or the day of this event.
[02:40:14.182 --> 02:40:14.962]  Is that not in the Bible?
[02:40:16.783 --> 02:40:18.103]  It does tell us the season.
[02:40:19.423 --> 02:40:20.664]  It doesn't tell us the hour.
[02:40:21.224 --> 02:40:21.824]  Let me continue.
[02:40:21.844 --> 02:40:22.404]  Let me continue.
[02:40:22.825 --> 02:40:23.105]  Okay.
[02:40:23.845 --> 02:40:28.567]  Darren the Bright Guy asked you, I was talking to you, I said, do you think we shouldn't have fought Hitler?
[02:40:31.029 --> 02:40:32.669]  That's correct, and I said we should have.
[02:40:32.810 --> 02:40:35.491]  Because a lot of people thought he was the Antichrist and said to lay down to him.
[02:40:35.511 --> 02:40:36.011]  Did you know that?
[02:40:36.511 --> 02:40:39.533]  That is correct, and a lot of people thought it was a turn of the century.
[02:40:39.693 --> 02:40:43.815]  Okay, the poor Africans in Rwanda thought it was the end of the world.
[02:40:43.835 --> 02:40:44.235]  That's correct.
[02:40:44.315 --> 02:40:48.077]  The poor Christian Tutsi minority thought that it was the end of the world and they didn't fight back.
[02:40:48.652 --> 02:40:49.132]  That's correct.
[02:40:49.633 --> 02:40:51.754]  Okay, now understand something.
[02:40:52.034 --> 02:41:01.641]  I have a duty, I have a commandment in the Bible hundreds of times to fight evil, try to overturn wickedness, to do that, and is that not in the Bible over and over again?
[02:41:02.101 --> 02:41:03.703]  Yes, you do, and I commend you for that.
[02:41:03.763 --> 02:41:04.984]  Okay, well, let's continue here.
[02:41:05.544 --> 02:41:15.731]  How many times did God send prophets, and I'm not saying I'm a prophet, we all have a job to fight evil, to go to a city, to go to a country and say, repent now, and you'll get a reprieve, but if you don't, you're going to be destroyed.
[02:41:15.791 --> 02:41:16.392]  How many times?
[02:41:17.973 --> 02:41:18.393]  Many times.
[02:41:19.036 --> 02:41:19.276]  Okay.
[02:41:20.577 --> 02:41:26.002]  Now, certainly the globalists are following the revelation model.
[02:41:26.402 --> 02:41:27.343]  They're setting it up.
[02:41:27.683 --> 02:41:28.704]  They are Satanists.
[02:41:28.804 --> 02:41:29.965]  That's mainstream news.
[02:41:30.265 --> 02:41:34.028]  Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, all of that, that's what they're into.
[02:41:34.609 --> 02:41:38.331]  Now, certainly we now have the microchips, the one world government.
[02:41:38.392 --> 02:41:39.232]  It is all forming.
[02:41:39.272 --> 02:41:40.133]  It is all happening.
[02:41:41.844 --> 02:41:42.645]  We're good to go.
[02:42:00.223 --> 02:42:08.128]  Well, in every case I see, this anti-Christ spirit runs around murdering and killing in Russia and Germany and everywhere else, and people think, oh, I don't have to do anything.
[02:42:08.629 --> 02:42:17.275]  I hear the so-called Christians on talk radio saying, praise Bush, he's a man of God, Patriot Act's good, biometrics are good, microchips are good.
[02:42:17.775 --> 02:42:21.538]  So why are suddenly all these Christians thinking this is all wonderful?
[02:42:22.178 --> 02:42:23.199]  Well, let me tell you something.
[02:42:23.219 --> 02:42:26.501]  Every one of those Christians, every one of those pastors and teachers...
[02:42:26.952 --> 02:42:27.973]  So let me stop you.
[02:42:28.013 --> 02:42:32.816]  Two years ago, two and a half years ago, the session before and last in the legislature,
[02:42:44.671 --> 02:42:46.411]  Nobody was trying to stop the gun bills.
[02:42:46.611 --> 02:42:47.712]  I got our listeners together.
[02:42:47.752 --> 02:42:48.772]  We had two rallies.
[02:42:49.232 --> 02:42:54.913]  I went in, sat there all day, caught bribery going on for testimony, and that killed the bills.
[02:42:55.293 --> 02:42:58.514]  So you're saying I shouldn't have gone myself and defeated bills?
[02:42:59.114 --> 02:42:59.934]  Absolutely not.
[02:42:59.974 --> 02:43:00.874]  I did not say that.
[02:43:01.074 --> 02:43:02.114]  Okay, well, explain to me.
[02:43:02.854 --> 02:43:06.735]  Every time I go and fight the New World Order, I'm able to have victories.
[02:43:07.255 --> 02:43:11.216]  And I know you can have victories, and I know we outnumber them, and I know we can change things.
[02:43:11.923 --> 02:43:15.084]  Alex, I've been fighting the New World Order for 27 years.
[02:43:15.224 --> 02:43:17.345]  I have had a great deal of victories myself.
[02:43:17.485 --> 02:43:18.566]  I am not saying that.
[02:43:18.966 --> 02:43:23.048]  Through our victories, we need to teach others to come out of her.
[02:43:23.632 --> 02:43:34.919]  We need to teach others how you don't have to go to them stores and get their microchips, how to live on our own, come out of her, my people, so that you are not partakers of the plagues and the sins that are coming upon us.
[02:43:35.079 --> 02:43:35.659]  I agree with you.
[02:43:35.699 --> 02:43:37.320]  We should build our own infrastructure.
[02:43:37.400 --> 02:43:38.761]  We should do that, and thanks for the call.
[02:43:38.781 --> 02:43:39.982]  I don't think we really disagree then.
[02:43:40.102 --> 02:43:40.782]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:43:41.083 --> 02:43:41.823]  Yeah, I appreciate it.
[02:43:41.843 --> 02:43:46.306]  So there, that's the level of someone not agreeing with me.
[02:43:47.086 --> 02:43:47.967]  That's indicative of it.
[02:43:49.067 --> 02:43:49.768]  So what do you think?
[02:43:51.429 --> 02:43:53.330]  Did anybody else call in that disagrees with me?
[02:43:55.399 --> 02:43:57.400]  Okay, Bill and KC, he disagrees.
[02:43:57.440 --> 02:43:58.640]  Bill and KC, go ahead.
[02:43:59.881 --> 02:44:06.264]  Yeah, I wanted to talk about the difference of George Washington and Benjamin Franklin when we were fighting the Revolutionary War.
[02:44:06.324 --> 02:44:07.444]  Okay, so you disagree with me.
[02:44:08.785 --> 02:44:10.325]  On how you're going to stop them, yes.
[02:44:10.665 --> 02:44:11.606]  On how you're going to stop them.
[02:44:11.646 --> 02:44:17.188]  You're not going to go to these evil baby killers that have slaves and try to vote them out of office.
[02:44:17.208 --> 02:44:19.709]  Because you said the vote, we don't control the vote.
[02:44:20.109 --> 02:44:21.450]  So how are we going to vote them out of office?
[02:44:22.202 --> 02:44:30.747]  With the soapbox, with the soapbox, with the jury box, the grand jury box, with lawsuits, with boycotts, with education.
[02:44:30.767 --> 02:44:31.787]  It's like Ceausescu.
[02:44:31.847 --> 02:44:36.290]  Nobody could vote in Romania, but one day they woke up and everybody hated his guts.
[02:44:36.910 --> 02:44:37.871]  And they started shooting.
[02:44:39.131 --> 02:44:41.272]  I remember it when it happened, Nicolae Ceausescu.
[02:44:41.312 --> 02:44:43.133]  They took their guns and started shooting.
[02:44:43.994 --> 02:44:46.935]  Eventually, you can only wake up so many people.
[02:44:47.536 --> 02:44:51.598]  Let's say, for example, you woke everybody up that can't possibly be woke up.
[02:44:52.096 --> 02:44:53.957]  Which is, I think, you're the point to your two.
[02:44:54.877 --> 02:45:03.980]  Now, you're not going to go to these evil empire people and ask them, hey, please stop kidnapping people, stop murdering, stop ramming planes into towers.
[02:45:04.240 --> 02:45:07.641]  There's going to have to be a confrontation with guns.
[02:45:08.241 --> 02:45:09.502]  And I'm not a federal agent.
[02:45:11.482 --> 02:45:12.723]  I'm a normal citizen.
[02:45:14.083 --> 02:45:15.443]  I've been listening to you for years.
[02:45:18.184 --> 02:45:19.845]  Yeah, you called a few months ago and...
[02:45:21.698 --> 02:45:23.799]  I'm telling you, sir, let me ask you a question.
[02:45:23.859 --> 02:45:26.260]  Why do the feds blow things up and try to blame it on us?
[02:45:26.660 --> 02:45:27.440]  Why do they want that?
[02:45:27.500 --> 02:45:29.061]  They want to have a confrontation now.
[02:45:29.421 --> 02:45:33.143]  They know we're growing our numbers to the point that we can't be stopped either way.
[02:45:34.123 --> 02:45:37.024]  Well, it's going to end in a confrontation.
[02:45:37.344 --> 02:45:39.045]  And I know you don't want to say the K word.
[02:45:40.005 --> 02:45:41.546]  That's why you hang up on me last time.
[02:45:41.866 --> 02:45:47.488]  But the difference, everybody needs to study the difference between George Washington and Benjamin Franklin.
[02:45:47.548 --> 02:45:49.249]  Benjamin Franklin went to Europe
[02:45:50.040 --> 02:45:53.342]  And tried to discuss with the British.
[02:45:53.742 --> 02:45:55.483]  Benjamin Franklin was a British agent.
[02:45:56.123 --> 02:45:59.225]  Well, he's portrayed as a hero to everybody in this country.
[02:45:59.765 --> 02:46:05.708]  But George Washington picked up a rifle and was shooting at the British and the sheriff.
[02:46:05.808 --> 02:46:15.153]  And that's why FEMA, that's why FEMA, where you're at, there in Missouri, openly teaches that the Founding Fathers are terrorists.
[02:46:15.933 --> 02:46:16.334]  Oh, I know.
[02:46:16.414 --> 02:46:18.995]  I'm feeling we just got our concealed carry permit here.
[02:46:19.591 --> 02:46:20.992]  Which turns a light into a privilege.
[02:46:22.033 --> 02:46:23.174]  Well, yeah, I understand that.
[02:46:23.274 --> 02:46:29.519]  But if I get pulled over and I have a concealed gun and I don't have that permit, they're going to take me out.
[02:46:29.999 --> 02:46:30.380]  I hear you.
[02:46:30.400 --> 02:46:31.260]  Look, thanks for the call.
[02:46:31.300 --> 02:46:32.221]  This is how it works.
[02:46:32.441 --> 02:46:35.724]  New York, 60 years ago, started issuing carry permits.
[02:46:37.225 --> 02:46:39.187]  Then they boost the price, make you take classes.
[02:46:39.527 --> 02:46:40.728]  Then they just stop offering it.
[02:46:41.929 --> 02:46:48.034]  And then literally only mob bosses who give $30,000 to the sheriff's reelection campaign get to carry the guns.
[02:46:50.282 --> 02:46:52.345]  So these concealed carries are the worst thing ever.
[02:46:53.045 --> 02:46:57.931]  We need Vermont-style concealed carry where they say it's called the Second Amendment.
[02:46:58.992 --> 02:47:00.774]  If you don't have a felony, you can own a gun.
[02:47:00.794 --> 02:47:06.781]  And by the way, I think felons should be able to own guns because anybody that's still a criminal is going to carry a gun anyway.
[02:47:07.562 --> 02:47:08.043]  You know what?
[02:47:09.073 --> 02:47:16.415]  A hundred and something years ago, when we had a very low crime rate, and when you got out of jail, if you were arrested, it didn't matter if it was for shooting somebody.
[02:47:16.775 --> 02:47:22.436]  When you served your 20 years, when you got out, they'd hand you your shotgun, your six-shooter's back.
[02:47:23.337 --> 02:47:23.817]  But you know what?
[02:47:23.837 --> 02:47:25.637]  Everybody else had guns to defend against you.
[02:47:26.417 --> 02:47:29.858]  It's all used to come after law-abiding people, not the criminals.
[02:47:30.778 --> 02:47:32.559]  So I am for zero gun laws.
[02:47:32.859 --> 02:47:33.039]  Period.
[02:47:33.059 --> 02:47:33.319]  Period.
[02:47:34.341 --> 02:47:44.627]  And that's constitutional, and that's... Back when everybody had guns, and my daddy could take a shotgun to school, and he was going hunting after school in a big school district here in Texas, you didn't have school shootings.
[02:47:44.647 --> 02:47:45.607]  You didn't have accidents.
[02:47:45.908 --> 02:47:47.108]  People knew how to use guns.
[02:47:47.128 --> 02:47:48.169]  They had proper training.
[02:47:48.809 --> 02:47:52.671]  And when this country had to go to war, we were unstoppable because we had the best shooters in the world.
[02:47:53.092 --> 02:47:54.192]  Now we don't have that.
[02:47:57.414 --> 02:48:00.656]  My generation is one of the last generations trained with guns from age four.
[02:48:03.280 --> 02:48:05.522]  Trained in safety for years before I could even touch a gun.
[02:48:06.763 --> 02:48:08.024]  And that's ingrained in me today.
[02:48:10.226 --> 02:48:15.610]  I see these cops all the time on video, mishandling guns, waving them around, shooting their own officers.
[02:48:15.870 --> 02:48:17.031]  You're a bunch of idiots, too.
[02:48:18.172 --> 02:48:19.513]  Killing your own people, you fools.
[02:48:19.533 --> 02:48:21.294]  You don't even know how to use a firearm properly.
[02:48:22.956 --> 02:48:25.718]  We're a pathetic country of jellyfish, and it's time to wake up.
[02:48:25.738 --> 02:48:27.920]  Let's cover some news, and we'll go back to calls.
[02:48:27.940 --> 02:48:28.941]  Does anybody else disagree with me?
[02:48:28.961 --> 02:48:31.122]  See, it's all I'm not hardcore enough.
[02:48:31.142 --> 02:48:31.743]  See, I told you.
[02:48:32.248 --> 02:48:33.229]  I'm not hardcore enough.
[02:48:33.509 --> 02:48:38.572]  No, I want to hear the new order doesn't exist, and I'm bad, and microchips are good.
[02:48:38.592 --> 02:48:39.612]  I mean, I know you're out there.
[02:48:40.333 --> 02:48:41.553]  I get your emails once a week.
[02:48:41.573 --> 02:48:43.755]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:48:43.775 --> 02:48:44.315]  We say it slowly.
[02:48:44.335 --> 02:48:44.395]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:48:44.415 --> 02:48:47.617]  Stephanie, does anybody else want to disagree with me?
[02:48:47.637 --> 02:48:50.759]  So there's more people calling in that agree.
[02:49:00.951 --> 02:49:03.654]  Okay, well, we might go to them.
[02:49:03.674 --> 02:49:03.734]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:49:03.814 --> 02:49:04.395]  Come on!
[02:49:04.835 --> 02:49:05.396]  Come on!
[02:49:06.057 --> 02:49:08.079]  Come on!
[02:49:09.020 --> 02:49:09.681]  Tell me I'm wrong!
[02:49:09.721 --> 02:49:10.582]  Tell me I made something up!
[02:49:12.589 --> 02:49:19.672]  I told you last week it looked like they were trying to kill the psychopath Kim Jong-il or push him into a nuclear strike, which will then bring us into the New World Order via the crisis.
[02:49:20.232 --> 02:49:25.794]  China is pretty sneaky, and who knows what they're up to.
[02:49:26.294 --> 02:49:33.756]  Channel News Asia reporting defectors say North Korean train accident may have been linked to possible plot to murder Kim.
[02:49:34.937 --> 02:49:40.639]  A deadly train accident in North Korea last week may have been linked to an assassination attempt on North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.
[02:49:42.014 --> 02:49:51.880]  They were among a group of 20 defectors speaking to reporters in Washington to mark North Korea's Freedom Day, an annual event of the United States highlighting human rights abuses under the repressive Stalinist regime.
[02:49:52.020 --> 02:50:00.686]  Kim Jong-il, 71, said through an interpreter that the train accident could have been a botched attempt to murder the Supreme Leader.
[02:50:02.087 --> 02:50:03.388]  Well, government can't be wrong.
[02:50:03.448 --> 02:50:08.791]  Romans 13, we should follow what Kim Jong-il says, according to Jay Sekulow.
[02:50:09.332 --> 02:50:09.652]  There is a
[02:50:10.330 --> 02:50:15.512]  Possibility that some terrorists or rebellious groups want to kill Kim Jong-il, he said.
[02:50:16.533 --> 02:50:26.977]  Whether it is accidental or intentional, whatever happens, the regime will try to do everything to secure money from outside, said the retired Russian-trained architect and engineer who defected in South Korea in 1992.
[02:50:27.237 --> 02:50:31.819]  I got these articles about the oil prices and a few other schniblets.
[02:50:33.140 --> 02:50:36.861]  The information, prisonplanet.tv is the new website.
[02:50:37.261 --> 02:50:39.161]  Prisonplanet.tv.
[02:50:39.622 --> 02:50:42.542]  We'll come back with the news, blitz, and some more calls in the final segment.
[02:50:42.562 --> 02:50:43.222]  Stay the course.
[02:50:43.262 --> 02:50:43.963]  Stay with us.

[02:51:45.188 --> 02:51:49.549]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:51:49.709 --> 02:51:54.071]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:51:56.684 --> 02:51:58.666]  This disaster is a new world order.
[02:51:58.766 --> 02:52:01.488]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:52:01.849 --> 02:52:06.053]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:52:06.133 --> 02:52:13.059]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:52:13.179 --> 02:52:15.201]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:52:15.461 --> 02:52:25.987]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:52:26.187 --> 02:52:31.551]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:52:46.599 --> 02:52:47.239]  Hello, folks.
[02:52:47.379 --> 02:52:57.301]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:52:57.681 --> 02:53:02.202]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:53:02.262 --> 02:53:13.585]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:53:14.185 --> 02:53:21.026]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:53:21.426 --> 02:53:23.567]  Your purified water is now ready.
[02:53:24.067 --> 02:53:29.028]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[02:53:43.570 --> 02:53:53.825]  All right, Mark in Illinois says he disagrees with me on something.
[02:53:53.945 --> 02:53:55.587]  We'll go to him in a second.
[02:54:01.878 --> 02:54:05.300]  Before we do that, Army scientist, I knew smallpox vaccine, AP.
[02:54:05.320 --> 02:54:10.844]  Military scientists have created a gene-based vaccine against the smallpox that shows promise in early animal tests.
[02:54:11.264 --> 02:54:18.949]  Today's smallpox vaccine, called Drivax, is made from live vaccine virus, a relative of the smallpox.
[02:54:19.089 --> 02:54:22.712]  It provides good protection, but can also cause some serious side effects.
[02:54:22.972 --> 02:54:23.632]  That's not true.
[02:54:23.652 --> 02:54:25.513]  Does he protect you from weaponized smallpox?
[02:54:26.014 --> 02:54:27.695]  And can spread and can cause smallpox.
[02:54:28.792 --> 02:54:30.513]  Here's the UPI article headline.
[02:54:30.553 --> 02:54:31.314]  The U.S.
[02:54:31.334 --> 02:54:40.819]  Department of Health and Human Services said Thursday that it was about to begin testing a new technology designed to help more closely monitor and assist the nation's homeless population.
[02:54:42.480 --> 02:54:47.263]  It's an implantable under a pilot program which grew out of the series of policy academies held in the last two years.
[02:54:47.663 --> 02:54:56.128]  Homeless people in participating cities will be implanted with mandatory radio frequency identification tags that social workers and police can track their movements.
[02:54:57.279 --> 02:55:01.462]  And then WorldNetDaily came out with this article, Biochip Featured to Government Health Showcase.
[02:55:01.482 --> 02:55:02.383]  That's where this came from.
[02:55:02.943 --> 02:55:20.076]  The syringe-injectable microchip implant designed to carry medical records and personal identification information underneath the skin of humans is just one of 20 new technologies chosen by the government to be showcased today and Friday at the Verichip Corporation, maker of the microchip, at a Health and Human Services meeting.
[02:55:22.831 --> 02:55:23.291]  Oh, boy.
[02:55:23.351 --> 02:55:26.893]  See, just calmly, oh, make you take a chip now.
[02:55:27.313 --> 02:55:28.613]  But I'm still a kook to talk about it.
[02:55:29.374 --> 02:55:37.677]  Financial Times of London, crude oil prices rose sharply to their highest level in 13 years, following surprisingly low inventory figures and record profits for the oil companies.
[02:55:38.497 --> 02:55:44.760]  North Sea Brent crude futures were 56 higher, 34.76 a barrel in late afternoon trading.
[02:55:45.520 --> 02:55:46.600]  It's totally raping us.
[02:55:46.620 --> 02:55:47.721]  There's more oil than ever.
[02:55:48.402 --> 02:55:49.463]  And they're just raping you.
[02:55:50.203 --> 02:55:52.565]  Robotic traffic cones swarm onto highways.
[02:55:52.585 --> 02:56:02.252]  Robotic cones controlled by GPS will shepherd automatically, will block roads, you name it, new scientists reporting.
[02:56:03.613 --> 02:56:04.853]  I've got a few other articles.
[02:56:04.873 --> 02:56:05.954]  We'll see if we have time to get to them.
[02:56:06.014 --> 02:56:07.954]  First off, though, Mark in Illinois.
[02:56:07.994 --> 02:56:08.635]  Go ahead, Mark.
[02:56:09.095 --> 02:56:09.895]  Hello, Alex.
[02:56:09.975 --> 02:56:14.756]  My brother Mike calls you all the time, and he's probably mad if he knows I'm calling you, but I saw your films.
[02:56:14.836 --> 02:56:15.577]  I agree with you.
[02:56:15.997 --> 02:56:17.677]  I only disagree with you about 20%.
[02:56:18.477 --> 02:56:19.518]  I agree with most everything.
[02:56:19.918 --> 02:56:20.958]  I look at you as Noah.
[02:56:21.298 --> 02:56:30.281]  I'm a Christian, and I believe that what you are is Noah, and God gave Noah the opportunity to save as many people, even though God knew they weren't going to accept it.
[02:56:30.799 --> 02:56:33.040]  Basically, the way I see it is this is the end time.
[02:56:33.140 --> 02:56:34.200]  We didn't have the technology.
[02:56:34.240 --> 02:56:36.201]  You compare gun things from 100 years ago.
[02:56:36.781 --> 02:56:37.762]  People have changed.
[02:56:37.822 --> 02:56:39.582]  Technology has warped the human mind.
[02:56:39.782 --> 02:56:41.303]  God is going to let man self-destruct.
[02:56:41.323 --> 02:56:42.423]  So what do you disagree with?
[02:56:43.004 --> 02:56:45.325]  I disagree with the fact that you say you're going to save everybody.
[02:56:45.385 --> 02:56:46.505]  I believe you're going to save a lot of people.
[02:56:46.545 --> 02:56:48.026]  I never said I was going to save anybody.
[02:56:48.406 --> 02:56:51.807]  Not save, but I mean turn people around and get them informed.
[02:56:51.907 --> 02:56:53.328]  I'm saying we can fight evil.
[02:56:53.368 --> 02:56:55.829]  We can effect change with God's help.
[02:56:56.149 --> 02:56:59.610]  And on top of that, sir, look.
[02:57:01.750 --> 02:57:03.911]  I mean, trying to break this down for you.
[02:57:04.091 --> 02:57:04.992]  I listen to the news.
[02:57:05.052 --> 02:57:05.932]  I watch television.
[02:57:06.892 --> 02:57:08.033]  I was at the gym last night.
[02:57:08.053 --> 02:57:11.975]  They were playing Marilyn Manson on big screen TVs at Gold's Gym.
[02:57:12.535 --> 02:57:17.557]  All this evil, this demonic stuff is all mainstream, like elevator music now.
[02:57:18.097 --> 02:57:19.818]  You know, it's not just the niche stuff.
[02:57:19.938 --> 02:57:20.979]  It's just massive.
[02:57:21.099 --> 02:57:21.819]  It's everywhere.
[02:57:22.099 --> 02:57:23.240]  It's a mass warping.
[02:57:23.300 --> 02:57:24.280]  Torture's good.
[02:57:24.640 --> 02:57:26.741]  Bill of Rights being destroyed is good.
[02:57:27.121 --> 02:57:27.542]  I agree.
[02:57:27.582 --> 02:57:28.782]  They're trying to warp us.
[02:57:28.802 --> 02:57:29.943]  They're trying to destroy us.
[02:57:30.203 --> 02:57:30.463]  But if we
[02:57:30.663 --> 02:57:32.324]  Recognize the mass programming.
[02:57:32.905 --> 02:57:35.007]  Then we can stand up against it.
[02:57:35.387 --> 02:57:36.648]  Right, Alex.
[02:57:36.668 --> 02:57:37.689]  I agree with you.
[02:57:37.729 --> 02:57:38.489]  I saw your films.
[02:57:38.509 --> 02:57:39.670]  My brother ordered the films.
[02:57:39.991 --> 02:57:41.052]  He showed them at the church.
[02:57:41.132 --> 02:57:42.393]  And I agree with everything you're telling me.
[02:57:42.413 --> 02:57:45.875]  The only thing I disagree with, like the other gentleman, is I think you're doing a wonderful thing.
[02:57:45.955 --> 02:57:47.597]  I just don't think we have much of a chance.
[02:57:47.617 --> 02:57:49.879]  We're going to be able to get a lot of people out there.
[02:57:50.159 --> 02:57:53.261]  But the mindset of people right now is warped.
[02:57:53.301 --> 02:57:54.542]  Marilyn Manson is warping.
[02:57:54.582 --> 02:57:55.283]  You're right about all that.
[02:57:55.303 --> 02:57:56.684]  Well, sir, I've got to stop you for a second.
[02:57:57.545 --> 02:58:00.147]  And my point is about Marilyn Manson is it's now elevator music.
[02:58:02.970 --> 02:58:04.631]  I agree 100% with you.
[02:58:05.152 --> 02:58:06.613]  What I'm trying to say to you is this, sir.
[02:58:07.113 --> 02:58:11.597]  You think that big guy can't be defeated, but once you get in the fight, you find out you've got a lot of power.
[02:58:12.738 --> 02:58:21.145]  And I'm telling you, I've had a lot of victories, and I know if more of you become leaders and stop worrying what the sheeps say, we can turn this thing around with God's help.
[02:58:22.066 --> 02:58:26.069]  We can at least make it better and wake a lot of people up so they're not conned by this system.
[02:58:26.880 --> 02:58:29.001]  So just stop saying we can't do anything.
[02:58:29.022 --> 02:58:31.043]  You know, resistance is futile.
[02:58:31.323 --> 02:58:31.964]  Move forward.
[02:58:32.264 --> 02:58:33.264]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:58:33.304 --> 02:58:33.965]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:58:34.185 --> 02:58:34.505]  Take care.
[02:58:36.380 --> 02:58:45.006]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:58:45.227 --> 02:58:56.495]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:58:56.715 --> 02:58:59.357]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:58:59.697 --> 02:59:06.164]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:59:06.324 --> 02:59:08.186]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:59:08.386 --> 02:59:14.412]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:59:14.672 --> 02:59:20.338]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:59:20.658 --> 02:59:24.579]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
