[00:00:05.825 --> 00:00:10.007]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.647 --> 00:00:11.467]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.227 --> 00:00:14.128]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.148 --> 00:00:17.449]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.051]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.014 --> 00:00:39.396]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday.
[00:00:39.416 --> 00:00:43.679]  It is the twelfth day of July 2004.
[00:00:45.321 --> 00:00:46.582]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:46.602 --> 00:00:47.983]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:48.043 --> 00:00:52.026]  Joining us here in a few minutes is Bev Harris of Black Box Voting.
[00:00:53.688 --> 00:01:02.815]  One of the most informed and active voices out there exposing the government takeover of the elections, the total fraud, up one side and down the other.
[00:01:03.604 --> 00:01:04.725]  She's here in Austin.
[00:01:04.805 --> 00:01:10.428]  She's going to be giving a press conference at the Capitol and talking to the Secretary of State tomorrow.
[00:01:11.449 --> 00:01:17.653]  And so that is something that you definitely do not want to miss coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:01:18.253 --> 00:01:20.034]  And then you asked for him, so you got him.
[00:01:20.794 --> 00:01:25.057]  David Icke is going to be on for two hours coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:01:26.238 --> 00:01:29.620]  And we're going to go over all the news as well today.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.301]  It's of the utmost importance.
[00:01:32.347 --> 00:01:37.670]  I mean, the mainstream headlines seem like something, you know, that we were talking about five, six, seven years ago.
[00:01:38.591 --> 00:01:42.113]  Here is the Associated Press headline, U.S.
[00:01:42.293 --> 00:01:46.916]  mulling how to delay November vote in case of attack.
[00:01:48.337 --> 00:01:48.857]  The U.S.
[00:01:48.997 --> 00:01:54.341]  News & World Report, of course, article where the White House said we will be attacked, they will suspend the election.
[00:01:55.942 --> 00:01:59.484]  Newsweek calls this their exclusive Election Day worries.
[00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:19.204]  American counter-terrorism officials citing what they call alarming intelligence about a possible Al-Cieda strike inside the United States this fall are reviewing a proposal that could allow for the postponement of the November presidential election in the event of such an attack.
[00:02:19.584 --> 00:02:20.465]  Newsweek has learned.
[00:02:20.485 --> 00:02:22.465]  That's martial law, boys and girls.
[00:02:23.605 --> 00:02:28.486]  And InfoWars.com wrote this this morning above the Newsweek story
[00:02:29.455 --> 00:02:37.080]  Fear-mongering and conditioning for total control, terror, martial law, and the end of the Constitution.
[00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:40.783]  More news today about terror and the elections.
[00:02:40.823 --> 00:02:45.666]  This time, we're being warned that the election could be postponed in the event of a terror attack.
[00:02:46.246 --> 00:02:49.828]  At the beginning of the month, we were warned that they might be cancelled outright.
[00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:50.549]  We have links.
[00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:53.211]  Every comment is a hyperlink to a mainstream story.
[00:02:53.951 --> 00:02:58.094]  Again, at the beginning of the month, we were warned that they might be cancelled outright.
[00:02:58.723 --> 00:03:05.245]  This is not to mention Homeland Security's ongoing fear-mongering that a horrible attack is being aimed at the elections.
[00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:09.567]  Of course, they can't give us any specifics, as we might find out about what their agents are planning to do.
[00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:11.127]  Can't let Homeland Security get caught.
[00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:18.810]  Across the news wires, the administration is letting us know that security is being vamped up in fear of a terrible attack.
[00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:23.992]  We all know who stands to gain from such a horrific event.
[00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:35.742]  We are being conditioned by this fear to accept the New World Order police state the globalist overlords will offer us should they proceed and orchestrate another horrible attack.
[00:03:36.798 --> 00:03:37.539]  Consider this.
[00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:40.901]  The fear-mongering is even getting attention in the mainstream media.
[00:03:40.941 --> 00:03:46.664]  Last week, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that some believe Bush is spreading fear for his own means.
[00:03:46.684 --> 00:03:47.945]  A lot bigger than Bush, folks.
[00:03:48.485 --> 00:04:03.435]  Don't forget Tommy Franks, the General, in his December 2003 interview with Cigar Aficionado Magazine stating that, Massive, casually producing events might cause our population to question our own Constitution and begin to militarize our country.
[00:04:04.306 --> 00:04:09.151]  You can read the Tommy Franks martial law will replace Constitution after next terror attack.
[00:04:09.931 --> 00:04:10.852]  Could this really happen?
[00:04:10.892 --> 00:04:21.522]  Don't forget the Hegelian dialectic of problem or the action solution has been played out by power crazy dictators many many times throughout history and also see 9-11 the road to tyranny for examples.
[00:04:22.763 --> 00:04:26.147]  Then we get into the election day worries.
[00:04:27.563 --> 00:04:35.884]  Where they get into the latest issue of Newsweek telling us basically give up all your rights and the new homeland will keep you safe.
[00:04:37.745 --> 00:04:44.846]  Alright, we'll talk about the CIA and voting systems and the takeover of that and how people are fighting back nationwide right here deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:04:45.826 --> 00:04:47.686]  And David Icke and your phone calls.
[00:04:48.647 --> 00:04:55.628]  Websites are infowars.com, prisonplanet.com and now prisonplanet.tv.
[00:04:55.668 --> 00:04:56.908]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:04.207]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[00:05:04.327 --> 00:05:05.148]  Michael Trudeau here.
[00:05:05.288 --> 00:05:08.590]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.434]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[00:05:14.574 --> 00:05:17.596]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[00:05:17.856 --> 00:05:22.140]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.242]  The chronic, everyday pain was miserable.
[00:05:24.362 --> 00:05:31.429]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.072]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[00:05:34.372 --> 00:05:37.053]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice.
[00:05:37.213 --> 00:05:38.694]  Only this time, it changed my life.
[00:05:38.994 --> 00:05:40.734]  After six weeks, I noticed an improvement.
[00:05:40.834 --> 00:05:42.915]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[00:05:43.115 --> 00:05:45.556]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[00:05:45.616 --> 00:05:48.317]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[00:05:48.497 --> 00:05:49.037]  Side effects?
[00:05:49.197 --> 00:05:51.478]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[00:05:51.638 --> 00:05:53.118]  Call Kliscott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[00:05:53.138 --> 00:05:53.338]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[00:05:53.458 --> 00:05:54.779]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[00:05:54.799 --> 00:05:55.439]  It worked for me.
[00:06:01.201 --> 00:06:05.543]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:05.723 --> 00:06:10.145]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:10.285 --> 00:06:14.706]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:06:14.726 --> 00:06:16.067]  The New World Order.
[00:06:16.827 --> 00:06:17.267]  Panama.
[00:06:17.568 --> 00:06:18.608]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:31.596 --> 00:06:42.000]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.542]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:07:07.154 --> 00:07:13.376]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:07:13.736 --> 00:07:21.039]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.

[00:07:53.994 --> 00:07:55.494]  Alright folks, it is Monday.
[00:07:55.534 --> 00:08:01.356]  David Icke is joining us here in about 25 minutes from now.
[00:08:01.416 --> 00:08:11.379]  It is so transparent to see Governor Ridge on television in front of all the
[00:08:24.432 --> 00:08:40.419]  Video screens hooked into the cameras on the street corners at the big FEMA command bunker laughing and smiling and telling us how the terrorists are going to hit us for sure but they don't have any specifics and oh they might have to suspend or
[00:08:41.497 --> 00:08:43.819]  At least push off the election.
[00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:52.185]  Meanwhile, the big voting machine companies have CIA directors, former CIA deputy directors, running them.
[00:08:52.225 --> 00:08:55.007]  Their own engineers quit and say it's all a fraud.
[00:08:55.067 --> 00:08:57.929]  We catch them stealing elections coast to coast.
[00:08:58.389 --> 00:09:03.153]  The federal government is paying to force states to put these systems in.
[00:09:03.513 --> 00:09:06.895]  They're fighting that there be no paper trail or no recount power.
[00:09:07.215 --> 00:09:09.177]  I mean, this is all transparent.
[00:09:11.076 --> 00:09:14.678]  I mean, no one who honestly looked at this could not clearly see what's happening.
[00:09:15.239 --> 00:09:18.500]  Military dictatorship is being set up in America.
[00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:22.843]  And John Kerry isn't going to save you, George Bush isn't going to save you.
[00:09:23.183 --> 00:09:28.326]  You're going to have to take action, my friends, and expose this corrupt system.
[00:09:28.726 --> 00:09:35.170]  We're at the crossroads, we're in the middle of history, just huge events that are taking place right now.
[00:09:36.795 --> 00:09:42.500]  So we have fear-mongering and conditioning for total control, terror, martial law, and the end of the Constitution.
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:47.504]  We've written a little blurb about this Newsweek article about, oh, they may suspend the elections again.
[00:09:47.564 --> 00:09:48.385]  Ridge is saying it.
[00:09:48.845 --> 00:09:49.085]  U.S.
[00:09:49.145 --> 00:09:53.849]  mulling how to delay November vote in case of attack or suspend it.
[00:09:54.570 --> 00:10:03.978]  A senior House Democratic lawmaker was skeptical on Sunday of a Bush administration idea to obtain the authority to delay the November presidential election in case of an attack by Al Qaeda.
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:05.300]  U.S.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:14.587]  counterterrorism officials are looking at an emergency proposal on the legal steps needed to postpone the presidential election in case of such an attack, Newsweek reported on Sunday.
[00:10:14.727 --> 00:10:16.969]  Oh, you really broke the story we've been covering for years.
[00:10:17.469 --> 00:10:26.155]  I think it's excessive based on what we know as Representative Jane Harmon of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, in an interview on CNN's Late Edition.
[00:10:27.536 --> 00:10:33.020]  Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge warned last week that Osama Bin Laden, that's Bush's business partner,
[00:10:34.283 --> 00:10:39.848]  As Al-Syed, his network head, want to attack within the United States to try to disrupt the election.
[00:10:40.869 --> 00:10:44.632]  They talk about Spain, which was clearly a Spanish government operation.
[00:10:45.572 --> 00:10:46.973]  We've gone over all that evidence.
[00:10:47.073 --> 00:10:49.115]  Look at who stands to gain from all of this.
[00:10:49.575 --> 00:10:58.622]  Then look at the actual, clear, physical evidence of 9-11 in Oklahoma City and the first World Trade Center bombing, where the FBI cooked the bomb and trained the driver.
[00:10:58.662 --> 00:10:59.223]  That's admitted.
[00:11:00.191 --> 00:11:01.512]  This is all amazing.
[00:11:01.993 --> 00:11:04.915]  Joining us from here in Austin, Texas is Bev Harris.
[00:11:05.776 --> 00:11:13.562]  We've had her on the broadcast many, many times, and she's shaken the foundations of this criminal movement to steal our right to vote in our republic.
[00:11:14.943 --> 00:11:26.893]  She's going to be at the Capitol tomorrow with a press conference, and she's going to be bringing forward information to the Secretary of State and others about the situation in Texas and all over the country, and we're honored to have her with us.
[00:11:27.173 --> 00:11:28.434]  Bev Harris, good to have you on.
[00:11:28.994 --> 00:11:29.715]  Hi there, Alex.
[00:11:31.542 --> 00:11:32.583]  You're here in Austin.
[00:11:32.683 --> 00:11:41.987]  Tell us, just for those who just joined us, in a nutshell, what's wrong with these electronic voting systems and then why you're here in Austin and how folks can get involved.
[00:11:42.908 --> 00:11:43.308]  All right.
[00:11:43.368 --> 00:11:46.229]  Well, actually we're doing a 14-state tour.
[00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:57.014]  We got the funding, and obviously we are still looking for funding, but we got the seed funding to start a non-profit publicly funded consumer protection group for elections.
[00:11:57.595 --> 00:11:59.976]  And we are on a 14-state investigative tour.
[00:12:00.612 --> 00:12:04.414]  We're spending quite a bit of time in Texas, as you can imagine.
[00:12:05.174 --> 00:12:15.400]  And we will be also doing the press conference tomorrow in conjunction with the events on electronic voting down there at the state capitol.
[00:12:16.421 --> 00:12:18.241]  And I've got a fundraiser tomorrow night, too.
[00:12:18.382 --> 00:12:20.703]  So I'm going to be breaking the news.
[00:12:20.843 --> 00:12:22.684]  I'll be putting that up on my website shortly.
[00:12:22.704 --> 00:12:28.347]  And I'm going to break the news of some of the things that we've discovered that I have not released anywhere yet when I'm there.
[00:12:29.219 --> 00:12:32.562]  Well, I'll tell you what, just give us a little bit of that now.
[00:12:33.002 --> 00:12:33.402]  You bet.
[00:12:33.803 --> 00:12:35.144]  I've got two full-time investigators.
[00:12:35.224 --> 00:12:38.506]  Actually, I've got a third one that I've brought in that we've been working with, too.
[00:12:39.127 --> 00:12:41.709]  And we're investigating the money trail right now.
[00:12:41.749 --> 00:12:47.173]  We want to know who got paid, and we're also finding out, you know, how did these things...
[00:12:49.122 --> 00:12:54.044]  Yes, there's all kinds of problems and we know that, but who made the decision?
[00:12:54.084 --> 00:13:02.728]  Because you see, we had to find some way to persuade all these 2400 county election people to buy these flawed machines.
[00:13:03.108 --> 00:13:04.128]  How did that happen?
[00:13:04.148 --> 00:13:06.769]  And I'm going to tell you, the mechanism is very interesting.
[00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:09.690]  All kinds of things have been done.
[00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.051]  Payoffs have been done.
[00:13:11.841 --> 00:13:13.784]  Um, pretty much whatever it takes.
[00:13:13.904 --> 00:13:20.932]  Well, in our own investigation a year ago as they were preparing for these new systems in Austin, it led us back to similar situations.
[00:13:21.392 --> 00:13:21.753]  Right.
[00:13:21.833 --> 00:13:25.437]  I mean, uh, uh, Bev, in a nutshell, what's wrong with the voting systems?
[00:13:25.717 --> 00:13:27.960]  And then let's get into your movement against it.
[00:13:28.582 --> 00:13:28.782]  Sure.
[00:13:29.243 --> 00:13:32.067]  Well, the voting system, we're not auditing them.
[00:13:32.367 --> 00:13:34.470]  Even the ones that you could audit, we're not auditing.
[00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.855]  For some reason, they've made it so that you no longer audit elections.
[00:13:37.955 --> 00:13:41.620]  Auditing simply means checks and balances to make sure that, you know, you can't cheat.
[00:13:42.381 --> 00:13:43.522]  And they've taken those out.
[00:13:45.542 --> 00:13:49.605]  And, you know, the machines themselves, we now know, they miscount.
[00:13:49.906 --> 00:13:52.047]  For whatever reason, they don't count correctly.
[00:13:52.227 --> 00:13:54.949]  And they're designed so you can engage in this fraud.
[00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:55.850]  Absolutely.
[00:13:55.890 --> 00:14:03.516]  They've got all kinds of, I guess you'd call them features, not bugs, that allow people to go in and change results.
[00:14:03.856 --> 00:14:07.839]  For example, to input negative votes or minus votes.
[00:14:07.959 --> 00:14:15.065]  There's no legitimate reason whatsoever to have a voting machine have a feature to input negative or minus votes.
[00:14:17.603 --> 00:14:21.106]  No, there's not.
[00:14:21.186 --> 00:14:35.800]  And some of the people running these voting machine companies, former CI directors, former deputy directors, you've gotten in on these internal meetings and discussions where they're going, we can't let anybody know we're doing this, it could be considered racketeering.
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.902]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[00:14:38.942 --> 00:14:43.887]  You've had engineers go public and say it's all a fraud, but then that's in the back of some news wire.
[00:14:45.001 --> 00:14:45.281]  Right.
[00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:53.484]  The best description I heard recently when we were going over some of this is it's like Mad Magazine.
[00:14:53.644 --> 00:14:59.766]  I mean, it's one problem compounding on top of another on top of another and it really is kind of
[00:15:01.169 --> 00:15:05.473]  Bizarre, and it makes you want... you know there has to be more to it.
[00:15:05.493 --> 00:15:07.715]  Well, why do we have Ben Harris not having to do this?
[00:15:08.095 --> 00:15:24.610]  Because the League of Women Voters has been publicly saying they don't want an audit trail, they don't want a record, but we send people to oversee and audit third world countries that have paper ballots, but here in America, if you want to know how something's working or be able to have a recount, why, you're crazy!
[00:15:25.333 --> 00:15:38.358]  Well, and understand, one of the things, too, I find very interesting is Black Box Voting, which is our group, we set up something where we have about 2,000 people who will be monitoring the machines to catch them in the act of miscounting and phone it into a hotline.
[00:15:38.378 --> 00:15:41.819]  We're not really revealing how we're doing it, but we've got a plan there.
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:49.923]  Well, interestingly enough, the same guy that's out there saying we need to try to cancel elections was also speaking out against monitoring elections.
[00:15:51.886 --> 00:15:58.869]  What possible reason could there be for the head of the Election Assistance Commission to say, I don't think it's a good idea to have election monitors?
[00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:05.473]  And then last week he told the Associated Press, we may need to cancel the elections or push them off, Bev.
[00:16:05.733 --> 00:16:12.576]  And then on top of this, they're saying they're going to have Homeland Security at the polls, I guess, to make sure the fraud goes by nicely.
[00:16:13.388 --> 00:16:17.450]  Well, and I'm glad you brought up this business about canceling or postponement.
[00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:19.711]  This is something we've got to nip in the bud.
[00:16:19.751 --> 00:16:26.754]  Let me tell you what, Americans, this is a plan B. The plan B is paper, ballot, pencil, day off to count the votes.
[00:16:26.874 --> 00:16:30.636]  There's a plan B. Canceling the election is not a plan B.
[00:16:31.215 --> 00:16:34.236]  That is just simply giving away democracy over fear.
[00:16:34.436 --> 00:16:35.697]  Well, this is pretty obvious.
[00:16:35.757 --> 00:16:38.538]  I mean, we've got them dancing around going, Al-Qaeda's going to get you.
[00:16:38.898 --> 00:16:40.119]  We may have martial law.
[00:16:40.139 --> 00:16:41.499]  They're actually saying martial law.
[00:16:41.799 --> 00:16:43.280]  We may cancel elections.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.061]  By the way, don't worry that the CIA publicly runs most of these companies.
[00:16:47.321 --> 00:16:48.262]  Ha ha ha.
[00:16:48.582 --> 00:16:52.843]  You know, don't mind the cameras going up and the men in black ski masks and the prisons being built everywhere.
[00:16:53.084 --> 00:16:54.284]  We're here to take care of you.
[00:16:54.564 --> 00:16:58.306]  I mean, Bev, this is like a scary science fiction novel.
[00:16:58.346 --> 00:16:59.326]  Yeah, and the thing is,
[00:16:59.326 --> 00:17:00.827]  Because we've got to stop it right now.
[00:17:00.847 --> 00:17:07.874]  We've got to say, look, every time that comes up, people have to vocally, immediately say, no, we're not canceling elections.
[00:17:07.914 --> 00:17:09.615]  We didn't cancel them in the Civil War.
[00:17:09.655 --> 00:17:11.857]  We didn't cancel them in World War II.
[00:17:12.178 --> 00:17:13.979]  There is no reason to cancel.
[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:20.305]  Postponing, we're talking, if it's physically impossible to hold an election, you may delay it for one day.
[00:17:21.613 --> 00:17:28.875]  This business about cancelling or postponing is inappropriate and frankly the guy who keeps talking about this should be replaced.
[00:17:29.375 --> 00:17:30.695]  This is not appropriate.
[00:17:30.855 --> 00:17:32.715]  Tell us about this Ed Minion.
[00:17:35.056 --> 00:17:48.639]  Well, Forrest D'Souza, who runs this new thing now, which was appointed by the President, he runs this new agency called the Election Assistance Commission and basically it seems to be the opposite.
[00:17:48.679 --> 00:17:50.659]  He's talking about how to cancel elections
[00:17:51.797 --> 00:18:03.019]  And this is what the CIA has done in more than 50 other countries, going in, scamming elections, canceling elections, and now they're just running the CIA off on America!
[00:18:03.959 --> 00:18:16.521]  Well, you know, the funny thing is, they brought in, think about this, they had a bunch of election officials, a small handful, who pushed these unauditable voting machines into every county in America that they could.
[00:18:17.201 --> 00:18:20.102]  These people pushed a flawed system, and we now know that.
[00:18:20.905 --> 00:18:25.367]  The same people that did that are the same people that got appointed to this new commission.
[00:18:25.567 --> 00:18:27.007]  Now, Ireland had it right.
[00:18:27.228 --> 00:18:29.228]  Ireland had touchscreen voting machines.
[00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:31.189]  They realized they were flawed.
[00:18:31.469 --> 00:18:32.590]  They got rid of them.
[00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:35.211]  They fired the minister who bought them.
[00:18:35.351 --> 00:18:39.853]  They said, hey, we could have spent 40 million euros on something a lot better than this.
[00:18:40.033 --> 00:18:40.753]  You're out of here.
[00:18:41.533 --> 00:18:48.077]  These guys, in our country, wasted not tens, but hundreds of millions of dollars on this stuff.
[00:18:48.377 --> 00:18:50.898]  And we rewarded them by putting them on this commission.
[00:18:51.259 --> 00:18:58.183]  Well, there's also now this federal funding for, what, over $5 billion to force the states to put this in, Beth.
[00:18:59.263 --> 00:19:00.184]  Well, exactly.
[00:19:00.244 --> 00:19:03.846]  But the thing is, if you really read that statute, it doesn't force them to.
[00:19:04.528 --> 00:19:09.892]  What happens is you've got this, again, small handful of officials who are telling everyone that's what it says.
[00:19:09.952 --> 00:19:11.653]  Nobody wants to read the hundred pages.
[00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:16.055]  And in the hundred pages it says, you can even keep punch cards if you want to do it.
[00:19:16.075 --> 00:19:18.757]  You just have to clean out your machines and educate the voters.
[00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:21.519]  But that's not what these officials are saying.
[00:19:21.539 --> 00:19:24.921]  They're saying, oh, the law says you have to go get touch screens.
[00:19:25.061 --> 00:19:25.742]  It does not.
[00:19:25.842 --> 00:19:26.222]  You're right.
[00:19:26.262 --> 00:19:27.483]  I've read the law and it does say that.
[00:19:27.523 --> 00:19:29.104]  But again, they're saying that.
[00:19:29.144 --> 00:19:30.064]  The people think that.
[00:19:30.445 --> 00:19:33.887]  Bev, when we get back, I want to talk about the press conference tomorrow, how folks can come to the meeting.
[00:19:34.682 --> 00:19:54.857]  uh... in your fourteen state tour and I want to get you back up tomorrow if we can after the press conference to talk more about this but folks I mean it's as bad as it gets and if they get this system in they're going to tell you that you voted for gun confiscation that you voted for open borders well you voted it's a democracy we'll be right back stay with us
[00:20:00.416 --> 00:20:03.898]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.

[00:21:06.203 --> 00:21:07.024]  Read the labels.

[00:21:11.785 --> 00:21:15.986]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:21:16.346 --> 00:21:21.228]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.

[00:22:00.244 --> 00:22:02.025]  Jack Browning for Midas Resources.
[00:22:02.525 --> 00:22:05.947]  Last summer we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[00:22:06.447 --> 00:22:07.107]  Let's update.
[00:22:07.627 --> 00:22:12.370]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:15.371]  The NASDAQ in that same time frame is flat.
[00:22:16.135 --> 00:22:17.076]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[00:22:17.116 --> 00:22:19.417]  dollar was worth 17% more than the euro.
[00:22:19.937 --> 00:22:20.858]  Today, the U.S.
[00:22:20.878 --> 00:22:23.099]  dollar is worth 28% less than the euro.
[00:22:23.519 --> 00:22:25.040]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:22:25.601 --> 00:22:27.602]  January of 2002, gold spot was $2.83.
[00:22:28.943 --> 00:22:33.805]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[00:22:34.806 --> 00:22:35.546]  Gold is moving.
[00:22:35.807 --> 00:22:36.967]  Equities are treading water.
[00:22:37.368 --> 00:22:39.889]  This is a little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[00:22:40.563 --> 00:22:41.924]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[00:22:42.365 --> 00:22:44.087]  Physical possession, private gold.
[00:22:44.507 --> 00:22:46.469]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[00:22:46.869 --> 00:22:48.992]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.

[00:22:59.119 --> 00:23:00.119]  It's finally here!
[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:01.240]  Spring has arrived!
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.381]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:23:04.622 --> 00:23:08.063]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:23:08.283 --> 00:23:16.427]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:23:16.707 --> 00:23:20.429]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.

[00:24:10.626 --> 00:24:22.570]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight, David Icke is coming up and Bev Harris has agreed that the last 30 minutes of the show today, the broadcast, to come back on so we can have some more time with her.
[00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:23.430]  So many developments.
[00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:26.951]  This is her final segment right now because we already had David Icke set up.
[00:24:27.011 --> 00:24:28.372]  She's here in Austin, Texas.
[00:24:29.264 --> 00:24:35.390]  And she's here to promote a press conference she and others are having at the Capitol tomorrow and a meeting they're having.
[00:24:37.371 --> 00:24:49.282]  In the next few days, you're going to hear some major developments from what she's discovered here in Central Texas, but she can't bring that out right now at this time until, well, let's just say, again, she's broken.
[00:24:49.963 --> 00:24:52.565]  I don't know, hundreds of major bombshell stories.
[00:24:53.245 --> 00:24:57.288]  And this new stuff, I talked to her about it during the break, is dynamite.
[00:24:58.449 --> 00:25:00.370]  Just catching these people red-handed.
[00:25:01.351 --> 00:25:11.098]  Bev, again, here in just the last few minutes with you, tell folks about the press conference right when the show starts tomorrow, actually, so I can't be there, at 11 a.m.
[00:25:11.138 --> 00:25:18.503]  at the Capitol, how folks should come to that rally inside the Capitol, and then the meeting tomorrow night, how folks get involved in that.
[00:25:19.201 --> 00:25:21.482]  Yeah, get over there, because you know what they do.
[00:25:21.983 --> 00:25:26.786]  You want the TV cameras to... They'll try to minimize the size of the crowd, so maximize it.
[00:25:26.826 --> 00:25:27.866]  Make it hard to minimize.
[00:25:28.507 --> 00:25:34.891]  And, yeah, get over there, and we are going to be really telling folks how it is.
[00:25:35.131 --> 00:25:38.033]  We're going to be bringing out the students about trying to cancel the election.
[00:25:39.013 --> 00:25:42.776]  This is just something that... The American people have got to say no right now.
[00:25:43.036 --> 00:25:46.558]  They've got to stop saying, oh, well, we don't think they're going to do this.
[00:25:47.071 --> 00:25:47.271]  No.
[00:25:47.451 --> 00:25:49.112]  I mean, it's got to be nipped in the bud.
[00:25:50.173 --> 00:25:52.554]  And yet, we've got a bunch of things.
[00:25:52.594 --> 00:25:55.796]  By the way, I wanted to mention real quickly something kind of ironic.
[00:25:56.977 --> 00:25:59.718]  I have a lawsuit that was unsealed last Friday.
[00:26:00.619 --> 00:26:09.804]  I am suing Diebold for, oh, you know, $40 million or so on behalf of the state of California to force Diebold to pay restitution.
[00:26:10.044 --> 00:26:11.845]  But the kicker in this lawsuit is
[00:26:12.469 --> 00:26:19.573]  It's a whistleblower lawsuit that has a bounty, and if that part of it prevails, it will actually fund my organization.
[00:26:21.234 --> 00:26:24.235]  So you would have people funding their archenemy.
[00:26:26.056 --> 00:26:27.977]  I thought that was kind of ironic.
[00:26:29.076 --> 00:26:29.897]  Just amazing.
[00:26:29.937 --> 00:26:35.220]  Now, tell folks which meeting hall, which conference room.
[00:26:36.621 --> 00:26:39.143]  It's in the Rotunda of the Capitol at 11 a.m.
[00:26:39.223 --> 00:26:46.467]  tomorrow, and then when I come back on at 1.30, I have to tell you I've been on the road and doing investigations so much I don't even know where my own fundraiser is.
[00:26:46.527 --> 00:26:49.409]  I will go and check that and have that information for you.
[00:26:49.629 --> 00:26:51.711]  Well, that's going to be at the Unitarian Church.
[00:26:52.685 --> 00:26:56.888]  I think they said from what, seven until ten or something?
[00:26:56.948 --> 00:26:57.948]  Right, right, yeah.
[00:26:58.148 --> 00:26:59.709]  I heard it being announced on the radio.
[00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:13.258]  We can really get into the details of what's going on and I gotta tell ya, we have two full-time investigators and we have been out there getting all kinds of new information that nobody not even
[00:27:13.772 --> 00:27:15.173]  Nobody's been able to get.
[00:27:15.353 --> 00:27:18.956]  Okay, everybody by like 1045 should get to the Capitol tomorrow.
[00:27:18.996 --> 00:27:19.856]  Take off work.
[00:27:20.276 --> 00:27:22.438]  I mean, your right to vote, I think, is important enough.
[00:27:23.198 --> 00:27:26.481]  Or ask for a couple hours off for an early lunch hour or two.
[00:27:27.221 --> 00:27:31.044]  Bring your boss with you, or if you're the boss, bring your employees with you for a couple hours.
[00:27:32.845 --> 00:27:34.866]  Get down to the Capitol.
[00:27:35.326 --> 00:27:37.668]  I mean, if you don't for this, what will you do it for?
[00:27:38.369 --> 00:27:41.371]  And go in there, and you're going to be bringing forward your evidence.
[00:27:41.411 --> 00:27:43.292]  Of course, I heard of the Secretary of State.
[00:27:43.892 --> 00:27:50.054]  And then tomorrow night, and when you're on in the third hour with us, you can give us the directions and the actual time.
[00:27:50.115 --> 00:27:55.136]  I know it's tomorrow at the Unitarian Church here in Austin, Texas.
[00:27:55.777 --> 00:27:59.918]  And then later this week, we're going to have you on.
[00:27:59.998 --> 00:28:04.120]  Once you're out of town, you can give us the developments of the dark issue uncovered here in Austin.
[00:28:04.628 --> 00:28:07.811]  Oh, I have to tell you, these things are going to keep developing throughout the month.
[00:28:07.851 --> 00:28:15.339]  We've got enough to, we are actually, we have enough to get to launching a new book, which just like the last one we'll be putting online for free.
[00:28:15.359 --> 00:28:16.781]  It's called The Black Box Shuffle.
[00:28:17.241 --> 00:28:19.483]  And this is about what the administrators are doing.
[00:28:19.784 --> 00:28:22.687]  Okay, The Black Box Shuffle, another free online book, great deal.
[00:28:23.127 --> 00:28:24.649]  And the website for folks to check?
[00:28:25.169 --> 00:28:26.450]  Is blackboxvoting.org.
[00:28:27.643 --> 00:28:32.327]  And it's in construction right now, so it's a little ugly, but it's got tons of information.
[00:28:32.367 --> 00:28:35.069]  No, it's a great website, blackboxvoting.org.
[00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:45.638]  And so, you're going to be back on with us in the third hour, but again, are you seeing people wake up?
[00:28:45.678 --> 00:28:50.822]  Because I hear everybody talking about, you know, Demold and election fraud now all over the place.
[00:28:51.542 --> 00:28:52.403]  Let me tell you something.
[00:28:53.081 --> 00:29:04.324]  I was in Canton, Ohio talking to Diebold employees, and Diebold would hate this if they knew how many are talking to me, but... Bev, are you there?
[00:29:04.344 --> 00:29:07.525]  The Diebold employees don't even know!
[00:29:07.545 --> 00:29:09.705]  They're in the dark about this!
[00:29:10.486 --> 00:29:11.706]  They're like, we have a problem!
[00:29:15.007 --> 00:29:19.188]  Well, there's been engineers of major companies quit and go public and say that it's a scam.
[00:29:19.893 --> 00:29:20.934]  Well, there have been.
[00:29:21.114 --> 00:29:22.074]  It's spotty.
[00:29:22.114 --> 00:29:25.536]  It's like people either totally get it, or they have absolutely no clue.
[00:29:26.017 --> 00:29:28.858]  It's growing, but we need way more public awareness of this.
[00:29:28.998 --> 00:29:34.602]  And it's scary when the employees of a company aren't even aware that it's having a controversy.
[00:29:35.222 --> 00:29:38.544]  Alright, Bev Harris, we'll talk to you in two hours.
[00:29:39.685 --> 00:29:45.648]  Two hours from now, we'll be talking to you here on the air again, and I appreciate you calling back into the broadcast.
[00:29:45.988 --> 00:29:47.049]  We'll talk to you then, okay?
[00:29:47.409 --> 00:29:48.169]  Okay, great, thanks.
[00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:48.870]  Thanks, bye.
[00:29:50.848 --> 00:29:53.889]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.

[00:32:54.957 --> 00:33:12.080]  They railed against the crown.
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:19.642]  Another ragtag band declaring their independence.
[00:33:19.762 --> 00:33:21.802]  They laid their bodies down.
[00:33:25.158 --> 00:33:28.082]  In a bloody war.
[00:33:28.782 --> 00:33:31.525]  For liberty, for their descendants.
[00:33:32.646 --> 00:33:34.028]  Thank God for the renegades.
[00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:38.092]  We're free today, my friends.
[00:33:38.693 --> 00:33:42.397]  I tell you, we're free if in our minds we believe we're free, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:43.547 --> 00:33:57.379]  So much of this cage they've built, the announcements of plans to suspend the election, martial law being good, the good guys wear black ski masks, they're here to save you, don't ask questions, it's treason to criticize the government.
[00:33:59.441 --> 00:34:03.845]  If you buy into that psychological, spiritual cage, then you will be a slave.
[00:34:03.885 --> 00:34:06.988]  But with God's help, we can't expose this new world order system.
[00:34:08.123 --> 00:34:15.950]  All right, here in about a minute or two, we'll have David Eickhup with us, and we're going to talk about who David Eickhup is, and what he thinks of this discussion of suspending the election.
[00:34:16.471 --> 00:34:21.936]  We know they've been gearing up for martial law for a long time, and this is all part of the acclamation process.
[00:34:21.976 --> 00:34:22.637]  We'll get into that.
[00:34:22.677 --> 00:34:24.238]  We'll talk about the Iraq War.
[00:34:24.979 --> 00:34:28.182]  We'll talk about what the new world order will look like if they succeed.
[00:34:29.804 --> 00:34:34.468]  And we'll get his long-term analysis of what he thinks is going to develop.
[00:34:35.416 --> 00:34:41.979]  And then, of course, in the next hour, we're going to open the phones up for you, if you'd like to talk to David Icke.
[00:34:42.019 --> 00:34:45.961]  In fact, the toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:46.281 --> 00:34:53.045]  In the last 30 minutes of the third hour, after David leaves us, we have Bev Harris of Black Box Voting.
[00:34:55.128 --> 00:35:01.151]  Joining us to expose the fact that the elections are now rigged here in the U.S.
[00:35:01.191 --> 00:35:03.272]  So why would they want to suspend the elections if they're rigged?
[00:35:03.673 --> 00:35:07.115]  To train us to not even have the illusion of an election.
[00:35:07.175 --> 00:35:12.938]  This is about getting us into martial law and selling us martial law as something that keeps us safe.
[00:35:14.479 --> 00:35:16.440]  Now my friends, I've made ten films.
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:17.240]  I've written a book.
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:18.301]  I've published a book.
[00:35:18.401 --> 00:35:21.623]  I carry a bunch of other great books and videos and books on tape.
[00:35:22.142 --> 00:35:27.026]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror, my two videos about September 11th.
[00:35:27.066 --> 00:35:31.689]  It takes two, two plus hour videos a piece to tell the story of 9-11.
[00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:33.831]  My book is excellent.
[00:35:33.871 --> 00:35:40.136]  Paul Watson's book that I published, Order Out of Chaos, elite sponsored terror, and The New World Order is an amazing book.
[00:35:40.737 --> 00:35:47.462]  We're carrying George Humphrey's new video, 9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati, your choice, fear or love.
[00:35:48.781 --> 00:35:49.765]  It's two hours long.
[00:35:49.805 --> 00:35:50.127]  It's only $19.95.
[00:35:50.167 --> 00:35:50.388]  Get a free...
[00:35:53.097 --> 00:35:56.500]  9-11, The Great Illusion booklet, color booklet with it.
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:36:02.906]  You get another copy for $14.95, that's two copies of the video for $34.95, and three of the color booklets.
[00:36:03.306 --> 00:36:12.835]  My films are all $25.95, all over two hours, $20 a piece, if you order three or more of any of my ten videos.
[00:36:12.855 --> 00:36:16.559]  And with my videos, you're authorized to make copies for non-profit, not-for-sale purposes.
[00:36:17.139 --> 00:36:18.741]  Which I have to actually commend
[00:36:20.382 --> 00:36:32.269]  Though I don't agree with a lot of what's in his film, just last week, it is true, I have the article out of the Scotsman, Michael Moore actually said he doesn't care if people upload and download his film on the internet, Fahrenheit 9-11.
[00:36:32.309 --> 00:36:36.871]  Well, we've been doing that for a long time, using the power of the people to take action.
[00:36:37.432 --> 00:36:43.455]  And by you, the listener, getting my videos, making copies, getting them out to people, it is unstoppable.
[00:36:44.015 --> 00:36:47.037]  So again, here's the toll-free number to get the videos, the books, or any of it.
[00:36:47.057 --> 00:36:47.757]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:36:47.797 --> 00:36:48.137]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:36:48.157 --> 00:36:50.899]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001-888-253-3139.
[00:37:02.342 --> 00:37:14.946]  South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704 or Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order via our safe, secure shopping cart.
[00:37:14.966 --> 00:37:16.247]  So don't procrastinate.
[00:37:16.647 --> 00:37:18.347]  Expose the murderers of 9-11.
[00:37:19.288 --> 00:37:29.151]  It's very hard for me to sit up there and watch Ridge in front of his TV screens, fear-mongering, talking about canceling elections, saying the terrorists are going to hit us, and knowing that they are the perpetrators.
[00:37:30.311 --> 00:37:30.691]  Knowing!
[00:37:30.752 --> 00:37:39.018]  I mean, it's hard to watch, you know, Ted Bundy sit up there on TV and talk about how he's saving all these women when we know he does the opposite.
[00:37:39.038 --> 00:37:40.639]  You know, there's my analogy.
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.522]  So let's expose them, one mind at a time.
[00:37:44.162 --> 00:37:50.027]  And the globalists know that the consciousness level, the awareness level has reached a boiling point.
[00:37:50.407 --> 00:37:52.269]  That's why the New York Times came out.
[00:37:53.639 --> 00:38:00.242]  Last, what, Wednesday, and we have the article on InfoWars.com, and said, oh yeah, the Bilderberg Group picked Edwards to be the VP.
[00:38:00.962 --> 00:38:02.482]  They called Kerry and said, we like him.
[00:38:03.183 --> 00:38:06.684]  Five years ago, I was a raving kook maniac because I believed in it.
[00:38:06.944 --> 00:38:11.766]  The New York Times attacked me because I said the Bilderberg Group was a real organization.
[00:38:11.906 --> 00:38:12.526]  It was public!
[00:38:12.886 --> 00:38:14.247]  David Icke's been attacked for it.
[00:38:14.607 --> 00:38:16.748]  All we're talking about is real things.
[00:38:17.148 --> 00:38:18.808]  Alright, enough of me rambling on.
[00:38:18.828 --> 00:38:20.429]  I hope you get the films and get them out to people.
[00:38:20.993 --> 00:38:22.274]  But they're having to respond.
[00:38:22.314 --> 00:38:24.314]  David Icke, good to have you on with us, sir.
[00:38:24.334 --> 00:38:26.715]  Nice to talk to you again, Alex.
[00:38:26.815 --> 00:38:29.456]  David, that's a good place to start.
[00:38:29.877 --> 00:38:35.559]  Why are they now having to reveal more than they ever revealed before at such an accelerated rate?
[00:38:36.699 --> 00:38:48.284]  Well, I think it's something I've been talking about for a long time, which is when something's remained hidden, but wishes to bring about a certain restructuring of society.
[00:38:49.017 --> 00:38:51.678]  A restructuring that we can see, touch and taste.
[00:38:52.258 --> 00:39:00.861]  There is obviously a point, a window of time when all that's remained hidden starts to hit the surface because it's being put into place in front of our eyes.
[00:39:00.941 --> 00:39:02.362]  It's restructuring society.
[00:39:02.882 --> 00:39:05.463]  So this has been going on for a very, very long time.
[00:39:06.183 --> 00:39:12.065]  Manipulating behind the scenes to bring about this restructuring and now it's manifesting.
[00:39:12.705 --> 00:39:18.387]  Since 9-11, of course, it has expanded and advanced very rapidly.
[00:39:19.116 --> 00:39:41.555]  And now they're looking in the next few years to put this world global fascist Orwellian state into place and therefore as they've reached that stage in their journey we have to see it and we are seeing it and this is not why now what you and me have been talking about all these years and other people too is no longer sometime never somewhere over some dark rainbow
[00:39:42.184 --> 00:39:44.147]  Watch out, this is coming if we're not careful.
[00:39:44.207 --> 00:39:44.969]  This is here.
[00:39:45.369 --> 00:39:53.745]  Big Brother is in our face because it's reaching the point in its time scale where it wishes to introduce what it's been working towards for so long.
[00:39:54.344 --> 00:39:54.925]  That's right.
[00:39:55.565 --> 00:39:58.107]  Now, David, you've got a powerful telephone.
[00:39:58.147 --> 00:39:59.568]  Can you back off that thing for us?
[00:39:59.948 --> 00:40:01.209]  Okay, I'll do it.
[00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:03.150]  Go ahead and talk again.
[00:40:03.231 --> 00:40:04.531]  Is that better?
[00:40:04.571 --> 00:40:05.292]  Yeah, that's better.
[00:40:06.273 --> 00:40:07.474]  We might have to switch phones later.
[00:40:07.494 --> 00:40:08.074]  I apologize.
[00:40:08.094 --> 00:40:10.836]  It's just really distorting because your voice is strong.
[00:40:11.877 --> 00:40:13.118]  Listen, I totally agree with you.
[00:40:14.756 --> 00:40:22.099]  They've got the bills introduced for a draft, they're announcing they want a draft, but then when we criticize it, they say it doesn't exist.
[00:40:22.439 --> 00:40:29.161]  That tactic of double-think, where they announce it, then when we criticize it, we're crazy and it doesn't exist.
[00:40:30.302 --> 00:40:31.722]  How do you counter that?
[00:40:32.942 --> 00:40:38.845]  Well, we are at this strange fork in the road, Alex, where
[00:40:40.802 --> 00:40:58.595]  People are now being given a very blatant choice which road they want to take because it's becoming so blatant that people like you and me, as I say, have been saying these things are coming and now having an ever greater credibility because those things are here.
[00:40:59.475 --> 00:41:04.479]  And so people are now at a point where they cannot hide from this anymore.
[00:41:04.779 --> 00:41:06.780]  They can't say, oh, that's just a theory.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:07.641]  They can't say, oh, no.
[00:41:08.382 --> 00:41:11.144]  The Bilderberg Group, that's just some idea, some theory.
[00:41:11.385 --> 00:41:16.009]  I love this genetic problem that so many humans seem to have.
[00:41:16.389 --> 00:41:19.912]  They cannot put the word conspiracy out on its own.
[00:41:19.932 --> 00:41:21.233]  They have to follow it with theory.
[00:41:21.273 --> 00:41:22.414]  The two have to go together.
[00:41:23.175 --> 00:41:24.756]  You're just a conspiracy theorist.
[00:41:25.197 --> 00:41:36.046]  Well, when you talk about the power of the Skull and Bone Society over the years, and then you find that the two candidates for the coming election are both initiates of a secret society that has relatively
[00:41:37.147 --> 00:41:48.391]  A tiny membership, compared with the 270, 80 million people in America, a country which we're told anyone can become president in, and yet this small elite secret society has produced both candidates.
[00:41:49.011 --> 00:42:02.695]  When you see the basic freedoms being taken away, in America and my own country too, when you see the legislation for the draft is there, and of course not only the legislation for the draft,
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:25.833]  But the clear necessity of it, when you look at the agenda outlined by the Project for the Euro-American Century, the creators and authors of which have run the Bush administration since it came to power, it talks about the need to have America fight and win simultaneous major theatres of war as a core mission.
[00:42:26.213 --> 00:42:29.095]  It's very clear there are not enough people in uniform
[00:42:29.784 --> 00:42:31.906]  Voluntarily to carry that out.
[00:42:32.006 --> 00:42:34.127]  So what does that lead us to understand?
[00:42:34.387 --> 00:42:36.269]  They're going to have to introduce the draft.
[00:42:36.549 --> 00:42:38.831]  Never mind the legislations there to be seen.
[00:42:39.271 --> 00:42:43.374]  That's an obvious follow on from following that agenda.
[00:42:43.394 --> 00:42:47.097]  They're going to need people forcibly in the military.
[00:42:47.357 --> 00:42:56.484]  So when you've got all these things happening now, and it's much easier, I've found in my own experience, to get people to see
[00:42:57.034 --> 00:42:57.274]  I don't
[00:43:15.228 --> 00:43:18.631]  Is that the number of people waking up is vastly increasing.
[00:43:18.671 --> 00:43:20.572]  I've spoken in Los Angeles.
[00:43:21.093 --> 00:43:26.357]  The last time I spoke in Los Angeles, I think it was about 500 people there, maximum, maybe less, a few years ago now.
[00:43:27.498 --> 00:43:28.639]  Two weeks ago there were nearly 3,000.
[00:43:29.239 --> 00:43:31.561]  And they came from all walks of life.
[00:43:31.922 --> 00:43:40.629]  And what's really, really encouraging, and you'll have found this too, Alex, is when you put people who have had no background of
[00:43:41.684 --> 00:43:52.172]  Researching this, in front of this information, and it's presented in a logical way, where A leads to B leads to C, you can see their minds open.
[00:43:52.973 --> 00:44:01.900]  And there's a number of people, a significant number of people in Los Angeles, who knew nothing of this, who'd been brought by people who'd been researching it and just said, just watch it.
[00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:05.262]  And it had an amazing effect on them.
[00:44:05.282 --> 00:44:11.367]  So the only thing that's stopping us being even more successful in bringing this
[00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:24.921]  I'm really glad that Michael Moore movies out there because it is showing large numbers of people that they're being lied to on one level.
[00:44:25.381 --> 00:44:36.732]  But I have to say, you know, and having been involved in this all these years, it did depress me a little bit that such a massive opportunity was lost in getting over what's really happening
[00:44:37.239 --> 00:44:48.342]  Yeah, he only gives... Because I've seen that if people are put in front of it, and it's done in a logical, coordinated way, that the world suddenly makes sense to people as it never has before.
[00:44:48.783 --> 00:44:55.585]  Well, David, look, I agree with you, and I tell this story every week because it's the best news I have from the front lines of the information war.
[00:44:56.245 --> 00:44:56.765]  I've done
[00:44:57.666 --> 00:45:00.868]  Over 1600 radio interviews since September 11th.
[00:45:01.168 --> 00:45:04.630]  I would imagine you've done hundreds or even thousands as well, I'm not sure.
[00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:07.953]  But I do 3-4 interviews a day most days.
[00:45:08.493 --> 00:45:13.096]  And 5-6 years ago, half the callers to shows disagreed with me to my own show.
[00:45:13.476 --> 00:45:18.139]  But on my own broadcast, but not just my own broadcast, on other liberal, conservative, Christian,
[00:45:18.951 --> 00:45:20.712]  Libertarian shows.
[00:45:21.232 --> 00:45:27.896]  We'll go two hours and maybe one person calls in that disagrees out of thirty callers and they're incoherent and hateful.
[00:45:28.176 --> 00:45:30.817]  So I've seen a total shift.
[00:45:30.877 --> 00:45:45.325]  I don't mean a partial shift, a total shift and that's got to be panicking the globalists but that means that even if their plans behind schedule and they've got problems, I now see them pulling out all the stops trying to rampage, accelerate their program
[00:45:45.925 --> 00:45:55.350]  The consequences be damned, as they say, into this new world order, which is dangerous for globalists and for those of us fighting them.
[00:45:55.470 --> 00:46:00.153]  So let me ask you, what do you see them doing in the next five months?
[00:46:00.273 --> 00:46:01.573]  What do you see unfolding?
[00:46:02.294 --> 00:46:07.797]  Well, first of all, I completely agree with you, both in terms of the awakening.
[00:46:08.337 --> 00:46:10.438]  My experience in radio shows has been the same.
[00:46:10.458 --> 00:46:13.399]  When I started talking about this in the early mid-90s,
[00:46:15.072 --> 00:46:17.574]  Crikey, the abuse you used to get on radio stations.
[00:46:17.614 --> 00:46:22.497]  You know, you're mad, you're an idiot, you're just an anarchist and all this stuff.
[00:46:22.697 --> 00:46:28.500]  And now that has dramatically changed because people are looking at their own experience.
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:29.801]  It's becoming obvious.
[00:46:30.782 --> 00:46:37.946]  But in terms of the awakening, starting to panic these people, that's absolutely right.
[00:46:38.773 --> 00:46:49.599]  I feel a sense of panic, a sense of, we must get this through, we must get this structure in place, because otherwise we're going to run out of time because these people are waking up.
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:58.945]  And I do feel that a lot of the stuff that's happening now is coming from a position of panic and desperation, which means they're going to make mistakes.
[00:46:59.325 --> 00:47:01.026]  And they're making a heck of a lot of mistakes.
[00:47:01.086 --> 00:47:04.308]  I mean, people are only going to look into the official story of
[00:47:05.604 --> 00:47:12.509]  9-11 on a really basic level to say that it's an insult to the intelligence that could possibly have happened.
[00:47:12.689 --> 00:47:19.755]  David, their official story is impossible and we've proven every step of their official story to be a fraud.
[00:47:19.995 --> 00:47:26.660]  There isn't a jury that was honest when presented with our evidence that would not convict the military industrial complex of carrying out 9-11.
[00:47:27.781 --> 00:47:28.221]  Agreed.
[00:47:28.402 --> 00:47:35.606]  You know, you can corner a rat and that's when a rat will panic and it will flash out at you.
[00:47:36.086 --> 00:47:54.897]  And so, in terms of this Illuminati agenda, I can see panic measures, atrocities, to be blamed on terrorist groups, which at the very least are nothing like as massive and organized as they claim to be.
[00:47:55.775 --> 00:48:20.215]  And, you know, when you hear things like we want to suspend the election if there is a terrorist attack, you have people like Tommy Franks, of course, a Bush family friend who was heavily involved in the invasion of Iraq, who said publicly a few months ago that if ever there was a chemical, biological attack on America, there would have to be military government to cope with it.
[00:48:20.995 --> 00:48:43.987]  So clearly this problem reaction solution technique that they use is going to be used with serious consequences in the months ahead because if they don't try to panic people out of their present and increasing skepticism with those in authority then their whole agenda is going to collapse.
[00:48:44.407 --> 00:48:45.848]  We have a situation now in
[00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:56.225]  In America, where more and more people are beginning to open their minds to the Bush administration, it's... I mean, you know when it's lying, because its lips are moving.
[00:48:56.985 --> 00:49:11.772]  And somehow, we have this big thing in Iraq, with all these soldiers dying, and civilians dying, and all this stuff, and to be fair, Michael Moore's movie has brought that more to public attention, the consequences of that war.
[00:49:12.272 --> 00:49:13.113]  And so, unless
[00:49:14.068 --> 00:49:27.920]  They come up with more versions of 9-11 to try to change public opinion in favour of, we must do something about terrorism, then this whole agenda is going to stop because of skepticism.
[00:49:28.181 --> 00:49:34.646]  And of course in Britain, well crikey, try to find someone in Britain now that believes a word that Tony Blair says.
[00:49:35.087 --> 00:49:36.848]  So Blair has the same problem.
[00:49:37.729 --> 00:49:39.951]  How do we move this agenda on?
[00:49:40.518 --> 00:49:46.939]  When my lives have been exposed, when we have all this grotesque trouble in Iraq, how do we move it on?
[00:49:46.999 --> 00:49:48.140]  How do we go for Iraq?
[00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:49.580]  How do we go for Saudi Arabia?
[00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:51.580]  How do we go for these other people?
[00:49:51.741 --> 00:49:58.662]  And it's going to be the old fallback position that they've used for literally thousands of years.
[00:49:58.762 --> 00:49:59.702]  Well, I agree with you, David.
[00:49:59.722 --> 00:50:04.923]  The events which you blame on the enemy, and then you attack the enemy that you've convinced people is responsible.
[00:50:05.084 --> 00:50:07.064]  Now, David, when we get back, I want to talk about something now.
[00:50:07.927 --> 00:50:10.589]  They can steal the election with their CIA voting machines.
[00:50:10.629 --> 00:50:12.150]  They've got both the candidates controlled.
[00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:14.632]  Why would they want to then openly suspend it?
[00:50:15.032 --> 00:50:20.896]  And the answer is to train us that martial law and suspension of elections is a normal event.
[00:50:21.036 --> 00:50:25.759]  This is going to be the cover for martial law if they decide to activate this.
[00:50:25.819 --> 00:50:30.042]  And now it's not Alex Jones or David Icke saying they're going to have terror attacks and suspend the election.
[00:50:30.322 --> 00:50:32.644]  Now they're openly saying it, David.
[00:50:33.991 --> 00:50:37.014]  It's a mind game, Alex, as we know.
[00:50:37.194 --> 00:50:41.338]  You can't control the people through physical means.
[00:50:41.358 --> 00:50:43.460]  You control some of the people through physical means.
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:44.601]  You can't control billions.
[00:50:45.122 --> 00:50:53.029]  You have to do it by manipulating them to believe, accept, and see the world in the way you want them to see it.
[00:50:53.249 --> 00:50:53.630]  That's it.
[00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:54.050]  Stay there.
[00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:54.691]  We've got a break.
[00:50:54.711 --> 00:50:55.972]  We'll be back with David Icke.
[00:50:56.312 --> 00:50:57.073]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:50:57.113 --> 00:50:59.055]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[00:51:00.606 --> 00:51:02.106]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:02.287 --> 00:51:05.387]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:05.507 --> 00:51:09.409]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:09.449 --> 00:51:13.690]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:17.811]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:17.951 --> 00:51:19.832]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:19.932 --> 00:51:23.273]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:51:23.313 --> 00:51:24.373]  The medical bills!
[00:51:25.973 --> 00:51:28.034]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:28.174 --> 00:51:31.215]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:31.395 --> 00:51:34.316]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:34.736 --> 00:51:40.858]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:41.398 --> 00:51:45.181]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:51:59.993 --> 00:52:01.614]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:01.734 --> 00:52:05.876]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:52:05.976 --> 00:52:08.877]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:52:08.937 --> 00:52:15.660]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:18.862]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:52:19.062 --> 00:52:21.443]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:52:21.583 --> 00:52:26.285]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[00:52:26.465 --> 00:52:27.306]  We're good to go!
[00:52:50.862 --> 00:52:51.222]  803-4438.

[00:54:05.762 --> 00:54:07.283]  This show is documented.
[00:54:07.803 --> 00:54:10.565]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:10.965 --> 00:54:14.467]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:54:14.487 --> 00:54:18.990]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:54:19.550 --> 00:54:20.911]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[00:54:21.031 --> 00:54:23.012]  The truth hurts, my friends.
[00:54:23.072 --> 00:54:26.194]  A lot worse to not know the truth and stumble into these pitfalls.
[00:54:26.814 --> 00:54:27.775]  We love your family.
[00:54:29.091 --> 00:54:30.293]  You care about yourself.
[00:54:30.934 --> 00:54:38.588]  You'll research history and see that tyranny, abuse, torture, power-mad megalomaniacs are the norm.
[00:54:38.748 --> 00:54:39.870]  Freedom is the exception.
[00:54:40.311 --> 00:54:41.814]  And the prison is your own mind.
[00:54:43.164 --> 00:54:45.565]  And if we don't wake up to this horror, it's over.
[00:54:45.625 --> 00:54:47.345]  I mean, we have the official U.S.
[00:54:47.405 --> 00:54:49.285]  government plans to carry out 9-11.
[00:54:49.405 --> 00:54:50.326]  Operation Northwoods.
[00:54:50.646 --> 00:54:54.847]  They explain why they want to remote control jets and crash them and blame it on foreign enemies.
[00:54:54.907 --> 00:54:55.887]  To bomb D.C.
[00:54:56.407 --> 00:54:59.408]  To kill Marines and blame it on foreign enemies.
[00:55:00.488 --> 00:55:04.589]  And then we have all the evidence of 9-11 in my film and in David Icke's great book.
[00:55:04.609 --> 00:55:10.710]  9-11, the Alice in Wonderland, attack on the World Trade Centers.
[00:55:11.599 --> 00:55:13.260]  I mean, this is the reality.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:21.203]  And their story has been proven to be a fraud, and it just takes you having the courage to face it.
[00:55:22.183 --> 00:55:24.624]  Because see, 9-11, it doesn't stop with 9-11.
[00:55:24.644 --> 00:55:26.805]  9-11 is just a primer.
[00:55:26.925 --> 00:55:28.085]  Each attack gets bigger.
[00:55:28.365 --> 00:55:30.986]  They plan attacks now on their own think tanks.
[00:55:31.246 --> 00:55:32.747]  They're saying millions of dead.
[00:55:33.465 --> 00:55:35.026]  Everyone with a national ID card.
[00:55:35.106 --> 00:55:36.306]  Everyone with a microchip.
[00:55:36.707 --> 00:55:37.687]  Neighborhood watch.
[00:55:38.247 --> 00:55:39.268]  Searching your home.
[00:55:40.468 --> 00:55:42.249]  Millions of us in a national draft.
[00:55:42.289 --> 00:55:43.230]  Here domestically.
[00:55:43.450 --> 00:55:44.770]  I mean, this is all admitted.
[00:55:45.130 --> 00:55:50.753]  A literal Soviet slash Nazi amalgamation with an overlay of a high-tech control grid.
[00:55:51.394 --> 00:55:53.916]  And the globalists know you don't read their policy reports.
[00:55:54.136 --> 00:55:54.496]  I do.
[00:55:55.057 --> 00:55:56.698]  And they say they're going to do this to you.
[00:55:57.218 --> 00:56:02.742]  And a lot of people in the system know this is true now, but out of fear, have decided to join this.
[00:56:02.782 --> 00:56:12.148]  David Icke, we're not just dealing with ignorant people in self-denial and in willful ignorance because they're subconsciously afraid of the truth, because everybody knows the truth.
[00:56:12.188 --> 00:56:14.029]  Everybody listening to me knows this is true.
[00:56:14.089 --> 00:56:18.912]  In your guts, in your soul, and in the facts when you look at it, intellectually, it's true.
[00:56:18.992 --> 00:56:21.134]  At every level of your mind and soul, you know it's true.
[00:56:21.594 --> 00:56:30.537]  You can try to deny it, but many people I found, David, decide to join this because they are afraid of it, because they think they'll be safe.
[00:56:30.837 --> 00:56:35.838]  What would you say to those millions of people who know this is true, but have decided to join it, David?
[00:56:36.298 --> 00:56:39.179]  Well, first of all, you're absolutely right.
[00:56:39.199 --> 00:56:41.760]  The four-letter word that is behind all this is fear.
[00:56:42.898 --> 00:56:45.060]  It's fear of terrorist attack.
[00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:46.721]  It's fear of this, fear of that.
[00:56:46.741 --> 00:56:49.023]  Once you're in fear, they gotcha.
[00:56:49.363 --> 00:56:56.448]  Because people who are in fear of something invariably look outside of themselves for someone to protect them from what they've been manipulated to fear.
[00:56:56.829 --> 00:56:58.370]  So fear is what they want to get us in.
[00:56:59.111 --> 00:57:03.395]  And they do not understand, because of their mentality, people who are not in fear.
[00:57:03.915 --> 00:57:07.078]  And so they can't understand mavericks.
[00:57:07.158 --> 00:57:08.159]  They can't work them out.
[00:57:08.199 --> 00:57:09.280]  They don't know how to deal with them.
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:22.490]  People who will say things fearlessly because, you know, these different levels of this Illuminati are terrified of each other because of the consequences from the level above of not doing what they're told to do.
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:24.200]  I don't
[00:57:45.405 --> 00:57:45.786]  Well, David?
[00:58:03.082 --> 00:58:08.966]  Well, David, that's just history.
[00:58:09.306 --> 00:58:17.230]  And an example is, they've now not charged one, but three different people in Iraq and Afghanistan, torture masters they hired to go over there.
[00:58:17.590 --> 00:58:26.815]  They're now charging them with the Patriot Act, so they can't speak out, and can't have public trials, and can't have lawyers, so they can't say, hey, I was ordered to do this.
[00:58:29.796 --> 00:58:37.700]  What they do is use people for as long as possible, as long as necessary, and then if it suits them to do something else, they'll do the opposite.
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:43.963]  The key is this, the agenda, that people say that this whole thing's a conspiracy.
[00:58:44.003 --> 00:58:44.903]  Hey, watch, stay there.
[00:58:44.943 --> 00:58:45.764]  We got a break again.
[00:58:46.044 --> 00:58:47.084]  Second hour coming up.
[00:58:47.104 --> 00:58:50.226]  We'll continue with this discussion of fear-based mind control.
[00:58:57.702 --> 00:58:58.343]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.003 --> 00:59:00.064]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.785 --> 00:59:01.906]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.526 --> 00:59:03.367]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.108 --> 00:59:05.009]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.669 --> 00:59:09.332]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.853 --> 00:59:13.976]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:19.861 --> 00:59:21.423]  Alright, we're into hour number two.
[00:59:23.158 --> 00:59:25.239]  From Los Angeles to Providence, Rhode Island.
[00:59:25.339 --> 00:59:27.500]  From Austin, Texas to Kansas City, Missouri.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.120]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:33.042]  Websites are PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:59:33.802 --> 00:59:36.503]  DavidIke.com is the website of our guest, David Ike.
[00:59:36.563 --> 00:59:38.504]  And your calls are coming up early in this hour.
[00:59:38.524 --> 00:59:42.366]  We're going to have David for a whole other hour and a half, honored to have him.
[00:59:43.426 --> 00:59:46.787]  Just got back from a record crowd in L.A., 3,000 people there to hear him speak.
[00:59:48.783 --> 00:59:53.125]  So much of what David has talked about, and I've talked about, and others have talked about, is now mainstream news in your face.
[00:59:53.185 --> 00:59:54.706]  Discussions of suspending the election.
[00:59:55.026 --> 00:59:56.267]  Martial law being good.
[00:59:56.627 --> 00:59:59.349]  When they start announcing it, it means they're planning to carry it out.
[00:59:59.449 --> 01:00:00.169]  How do we stop them?
[01:00:00.389 --> 01:00:02.511]  We'll answer that question coming up later.
[01:00:02.551 --> 01:00:03.971]  But, talking about fear.
[01:00:04.191 --> 01:00:15.598]  Once you let fear pass over you and through you, and put it in God's hands, and commit yourself to not, you know, the instinct of fear is still there.
[01:00:15.638 --> 01:00:15.958]  You just
[01:00:16.923 --> 01:00:19.464]  I mean, it actually gives me a warming effect.
[01:00:19.564 --> 01:00:26.486]  I'm just not worried about it because I realize intellectually and spiritually that fighting evil is the only course.
[01:00:26.506 --> 01:00:29.027]  When you give in to it, it gets bigger and bigger and worse and worse.
[01:00:29.387 --> 01:00:29.987]  It's a fraud.
[01:00:30.027 --> 01:00:32.888]  It's a con game that cowering to it keeps you safe.
[01:00:33.508 --> 01:00:38.950]  And a lot of you deep down know this is true, so you've decided to try to join in or go along with it, and that's ensuring it wins.
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:47.404]  You're truly alive once you commit yourself to doing the right thing and getting past your fear and move into action.
[01:00:47.724 --> 01:00:49.004]  David Icke, can you speak to that?
[01:00:50.325 --> 01:01:01.290]  Well, what I would say to people is when you come to the end of this little journey on earth, when you look back at your life, how would you feel about yourself?
[01:01:02.345 --> 01:01:11.595]  Will you feel good that you kept your head down and your mouth shut because you allowed a few crackpots to frighten you into submission and subservience?
[01:01:12.436 --> 01:01:17.681]  Will that make you feel good about what you've done or will you feel good if you know that
[01:01:18.433 --> 01:01:19.754]  You didn't succumb to fear.
[01:01:20.094 --> 01:01:25.796]  You let justice be the guide for what you did and didn't do and what you did say and didn't say.
[01:01:25.816 --> 01:01:32.779]  And that you stood up and campaigned for justice for all people and freedom for all people.
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:37.360]  The question has an obvious answer.
[01:01:38.121 --> 01:01:46.424]  Are we going to go through our lives and then be desperately disappointed about what we've done or are we going to be really, really
[01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:48.962]  You know, I'm delighted with the way we reacted.
[01:01:49.022 --> 01:01:52.225]  That's the fork in the road I talked about earlier.
[01:01:52.585 --> 01:01:58.530]  We can keep our heads down and we can be good citizens of the global fascist Orwellian state.
[01:01:59.971 --> 01:02:05.156]  It might save us from a few knocks on the door that other people get and all that stuff in the long term.
[01:02:05.832 --> 01:02:11.455]  Or, we can go down the other road and make sure there are no knocks on the door for anyone by exposing this.
[01:02:11.636 --> 01:02:13.417]  And that's what we need to do.
[01:02:13.617 --> 01:02:27.745]  Get the information that it exists out to vast numbers of people because it is the secrecy, the non-awareness through this period that this whole stuff is going on that has allowed it to reach this stage.
[01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:30.927]  We now have an opportunity to inform people.
[01:02:31.434 --> 01:02:40.841]  Because, at the peak of this pyramid of manipulation, there are a tiny number of people, tiny compared with the global population.
[01:02:41.261 --> 01:02:47.545]  They can only do this to us if we acquiesce with the building of our own prisons.
[01:02:47.925 --> 01:02:49.547]  And that's what we've been doing.
[01:02:49.987 --> 01:02:57.312]  Now we have the opportunity, and we can't claim ignorance any longer, to actually start dismantling these prisons and start
[01:02:58.172 --> 01:03:22.419]  uh... reaching a point where these tiny few are no longer dictating the lives of billions and that means letting go of fear and I'll say this from my own experience fearing something uh... is far more uh... an ordeal far more terrifying than actually doing it uh... people say to me, oh you must have lots of courage doing what you're doing
[01:03:24.119 --> 01:03:27.782]  I'm just doing what I believe to be right, without fear of the consequences.
[01:03:27.802 --> 01:03:28.763]  That doesn't take courage.
[01:03:29.283 --> 01:03:30.724]  Courage is to overcome fear.
[01:03:30.764 --> 01:03:33.527]  When you don't have fear, you don't need courage to overcome it.
[01:03:34.587 --> 01:03:37.570]  And doing it is so much easier than thinking about it.
[01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:38.891]  I mean, look at you, what you're doing.
[01:03:38.931 --> 01:03:41.013]  What I'm doing, what so many other people around the world are doing.
[01:03:41.033 --> 01:03:41.633]  We've got a break, David.
[01:03:41.753 --> 01:03:43.415]  We'll be right back on the other side of this quick break.
[01:03:43.435 --> 01:03:45.817]  We'll continue to get into the news, and then your calls.
[01:03:45.877 --> 01:03:48.479]  I'm Alex Jones, interviewing David Icke, July 12th.
[01:03:52.611 --> 01:03:54.032]  Somebody wants to sue you.
[01:03:54.172 --> 01:03:56.894]  With a few keystrokes, anyone can find out your net worth.
[01:03:57.174 --> 01:04:02.378]  Everything that you've worked hard for can be taken away from you as fast as you can say, frivolous lawsuit.
[01:04:02.498 --> 01:04:07.602]  Whether it's the IRS, a vindictive ex-spouse, or an average Joe off the street, don't let them have it.
[01:04:07.782 --> 01:04:12.225]  The Asset Protection Team can show you how to protect yourself from anybody that wants to sue you.

[01:04:15.007 --> 01:04:16.928]  Let the Asset Protection Team show you how.

[01:06:10.512 --> 01:06:13.655]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.

[01:06:57.825 --> 01:06:58.485]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.126 --> 01:07:00.166]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.907 --> 01:07:02.007]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.668 --> 01:07:03.488]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.229 --> 01:07:05.129]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.149 --> 01:07:09.452]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.972 --> 01:07:14.114]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:16.556 --> 01:07:21.899]  Alright, eight minutes and twenty-five seconds into this second hour.
[01:07:21.959 --> 01:07:23.259]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:07:23.299 --> 01:07:24.400]  David Icke is our guest.
[01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:25.901]  His website is davideicke.com.
[01:07:26.949 --> 01:07:29.091]  David, it's important that we discuss the false left-right
[01:07:48.759 --> 01:07:51.180]  paradigm, or this false bipolar world.
[01:07:51.220 --> 01:08:00.224]  They give us the illusion internationally that it's America versus Russia, or now the EU versus the American Union, or Bush versus Kerry.
[01:08:00.604 --> 01:08:16.310]  But then even a cursory view shows that there's no real separation, but they need to give us that illusion of separation to get us psychologically to put ourselves mentally into one of the two camps to then freeze out any debate.
[01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:17.811]  And an example of this is
[01:08:18.311 --> 01:08:28.037]  Three or four years ago, I saw globalist think-tank white papers that are declassified public stuff, where they say, look, the people are waking up that there's a world government.
[01:08:28.417 --> 01:08:30.239]  So we've got to give them a fake choice.
[01:08:30.279 --> 01:08:40.405]  They even say this, and this is in my film Police State 3, the documents, we need to give them a choice between a liberal world government and a conservative world government.
[01:08:41.105 --> 01:08:43.367]  And so, America goes in as the bad cop,
[01:08:44.224 --> 01:08:46.605]  Kind of like the Soviets were in the last half of the last century.
[01:08:47.085 --> 01:08:48.486]  We go in, take things over.
[01:08:48.546 --> 01:08:50.427]  The EU and Europe chastises us.
[01:08:51.147 --> 01:08:53.488]  Our leaders get caught as liars, get punished.
[01:08:53.768 --> 01:08:59.071]  But then the holdings, the sovereign countries that are gobbled up by the globalists, stay within the system.
[01:08:59.111 --> 01:09:01.872]  It's like Kerry and Edwards.
[01:09:01.952 --> 01:09:05.634]  And Edwards was just at the Bilderberg Group getting anointed, and even the New York Times admitted that.
[01:09:06.644 --> 01:09:13.310]  They're for the war, they're for the Pan-American Union, they're for the EU, they're for a domestic CIA.
[01:09:13.670 --> 01:09:16.312]  There's no difference in action, just in rhetoric.
[01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:17.633]  Can you speak to that?
[01:09:18.074 --> 01:09:26.321]  And how to get people out of this tribal Republican-Democrat, Tory-Labor, EU-US mentality?
[01:09:26.381 --> 01:09:31.165]  How do we get people past that to a freedom versus slavery paradigm?
[01:09:32.421 --> 01:09:43.910]  Well, I think a lot of people are past it without realising it, because the number of times you hear people say, it doesn't matter who gets in, nothing changes, exactly.
[01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:50.255]  So let's take that a stage further and ask the question, why, no matter who gets in, does nothing change?
[01:09:50.355 --> 01:09:52.957]  Except, you quite rightly say, the rhetoric.
[01:09:53.538 --> 01:09:56.180]  It's because when you are in a one-party state,
[01:09:57.032 --> 01:09:57.512]  I don't know.
[01:10:16.207 --> 01:10:16.367]  I think
[01:10:37.319 --> 01:10:42.441]  obvious one-party state, once you look at it, they have to give us the illusion of choice.
[01:10:42.741 --> 01:10:48.944]  And so what you have, and when you look at governments and elections, it always goes the same way.
[01:10:51.645 --> 01:10:58.308]  Most countries have two, maybe three, parties that can form a government with any chance.
[01:10:58.628 --> 01:10:59.288]  Usually two.
[01:10:59.308 --> 01:11:03.350]  If you take the American or the British version, it's definitely two.
[01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:06.011]  So what they do, the party that is in
[01:11:06.881 --> 01:11:14.205]  Power has the chance to change through legislation society to advance the agenda for the Orwellian state.
[01:11:14.265 --> 01:11:14.866]  So it does so.
[01:11:15.686 --> 01:11:25.052]  The party in opposition at that time does not have the power to do that, so it opposes the party doing it through rhetoric.
[01:11:25.512 --> 01:11:28.654]  And so, hey, they're for something, they're against it.
[01:11:28.974 --> 01:11:33.977]  Then eventually we have this farce called an election in which the parties change sides.
[01:11:34.537 --> 01:11:35.378]  Now the party
[01:11:36.132 --> 01:11:43.218]  that was in opposition, now has the opportunity to change society through legislation and advance the Orwellian state.
[01:11:43.578 --> 01:11:44.439]  So it does so.
[01:11:44.799 --> 01:11:49.623]  And it does things that in opposition it said it would never do and was supposedly against.
[01:11:50.483 --> 01:12:03.053]  The party that was introducing the Orwellian state in government is now the opposition, does not have the power to do so, so it now opposes that other party that is bringing in the Orwellian state.
[01:12:03.093 --> 01:12:03.694]  So you have this
[01:12:04.612 --> 01:12:05.933]  And other policies too.
[01:12:06.273 --> 01:12:18.321]  So this is why, as people who say nothing ever changes, no matter who gets in, have seen, that the common denominator is, whichever party's in power advances the agenda.
[01:12:18.741 --> 01:12:28.227]  And this is why, again and again, you'll see parties come into government and then do the opposite of what they said they would do, and indeed do what they opposed in opposition.
[01:12:28.287 --> 01:12:29.968]  And it's all a sleight of hand.
[01:12:30.623 --> 01:12:31.604]  Okay, so, now understand folks, a rat
[01:12:51.883 --> 01:12:58.431]  We'll be in a maze, and as long as it has lots of twists and turns and multi-levels, he thinks that's his entire universe.
[01:12:58.451 --> 01:13:01.715]  He thinks he has choices, but they're false choices.
[01:13:02.196 --> 01:13:07.322]  And so they'll put Bush up there to do all this evil stuff, then we run out the escape hatch,
[01:13:07.882 --> 01:13:14.024]  You know, this doorway that says exit to carry, and it's right into the cat's mouth, right into the jaws of the tiger.
[01:13:15.164 --> 01:13:21.286]  So again, it's left and right hands on this ogre's, you know, this one-eyed Cyclopsian New World Order system.
[01:13:21.886 --> 01:13:27.468]  And so by seeing that paradigm, by getting outside the rat maze, that's how we get the freedom.
[01:13:27.808 --> 01:13:30.409]  By exposing and saying, you know, we're against
[01:13:30.909 --> 01:13:33.830]  These particular policies, and we know you're all in it together.
[01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:34.630]  I mean, take Bush.
[01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:40.151]  Eighty-plus percent of Americans, Republicans and Democrats, Hispanic, white, black, are against open borders.
[01:13:40.191 --> 01:13:42.852]  But the Democrats want open borders, so do the Republicans.
[01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:46.613]  People are against gun control, but Bush says he'll sign the Assault Weapons Ban.
[01:13:46.873 --> 01:13:54.675]  People are against the UN, but Bush signs on to UNESCO, and now says our troops will be under UN control, and will be charged by the International Criminal Court.
[01:13:55.095 --> 01:14:05.482]  But then the conservatives all ignore that, but then expose that agenda being promoted by the Democrats, but then people are willfully blind to the Republicans promoting the exact same agenda.
[01:14:05.782 --> 01:14:09.164]  So, you know, how do we set about changing that, David?
[01:14:09.184 --> 01:14:20.411]  You know, take these electronic voting machines that are going in, and there's no record of how you vote, riddled with fraud, run by the CIA publicly, and then they say, oh, you're a kook because you want to know how you voted.
[01:14:20.711 --> 01:14:22.152]  You want to be able to have a recount.
[01:14:23.766 --> 01:14:27.410]  Well, I think, you know, again we come back to the simple thing of information.
[01:14:27.490 --> 01:14:36.941]  The Illuminati don't want to control and indeed don't control the mainstream media because they think it's a bit of fun and wouldn't it be great to control the mainstream media?
[01:14:36.961 --> 01:14:42.687]  They do it because it is fundamental to their operation being in any way successful.
[01:14:42.987 --> 01:14:44.029]  You have to control
[01:14:44.856 --> 01:14:53.739]  What people receive as information because what you're trying to do and what you must do is manipulate and implant a false belief in reality.
[01:14:54.439 --> 01:15:04.383]  So what must happen and there's only really one way of doing it and that's getting information out that challenges this mainstream monopoly on
[01:15:05.479 --> 01:15:05.759]  I don't
[01:15:29.987 --> 01:15:42.536]  The techniques of manipulation are to create problems, get you to say, do something about the problems and then offer solutions to those problems that change society, that advance the Orwellian centralised global state.
[01:15:44.273 --> 01:15:49.555]  Both parties, or any chance of government, are doing and will do the same things.
[01:15:49.595 --> 01:15:53.817]  They'll just do it using different words and different methods.
[01:15:53.957 --> 01:15:59.679]  Well, yeah, that's like John Edwards and Kerry saying, we want a domestic CIA.
[01:15:59.719 --> 01:16:00.900]  I mean, they want everything Bush wants.
[01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:02.020]  Now, let me bring this up.
[01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:05.282]  I haven't brought this up on air, but I think it's important to bring it up.
[01:16:06.142 --> 01:16:11.344]  I had a chance several times, more than several times, to talk to Keanu Reeves a few weeks ago.
[01:16:12.973 --> 01:16:14.433]  And, of course, the star of The Matrix.
[01:16:15.114 --> 01:16:17.454]  And he's totally aware of the New World Order, folks.
[01:16:17.955 --> 01:16:18.815]  That's all I can say.
[01:16:19.195 --> 01:16:21.135]  Just like Mel Gibson's aware of the New World Order.
[01:16:21.395 --> 01:16:23.836]  You know, the Gibson family, who we've talked to.
[01:16:24.776 --> 01:16:30.838]  But I had a chance to talk to Keanu Reeves while he was here in town working on a project quite a few times.
[01:16:31.919 --> 01:16:34.819]  And, you know, he watched my film Road to Tyranny, and we talked about it.
[01:16:37.874 --> 01:16:53.087]  He wouldn't get too much into the Matrix with me, and obviously he was just the actor in it, but clearly the Matrix, the first one's great, the second one's weird, and the third one, there's this deal with the Illuminati, the Illuminati says, okay, you're aware of us, it's going to destroy things, if you don't stop what you're doing,
[01:16:54.108 --> 01:17:15.790]  And for those of you that want to be free, we're going to have a truce and leave you alone, but for those of you that want to stay in the Matrix, we're going to have this bipolar, again, this false choice world, and there's a lot of really deep Illuminati messages on the dark side, I would say, in that film, and do you have any comments to that?
[01:17:16.684 --> 01:17:37.817]  Well, it's one of the areas, Alex, that I've been going into in more recent times very deeply and continue to do so, and that's the nature of reality and how we create it, because that is the foundation of how, en masse, we are being manipulated to create the world, the reality that the Illuminati want.
[01:17:38.257 --> 01:17:39.498]  It's very clear when you
[01:17:40.276 --> 01:17:40.516]  Thank you.
[01:17:56.018 --> 01:17:58.419]  The Marovinian bloodline is one of the key Illuminati bloodlines.
[01:18:12.996 --> 01:18:13.397]  I think so.
[01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:33.663]  And we actually do it in our own minds, in our own brains, the computer of the mind.
[01:18:34.123 --> 01:18:42.949]  But what I didn't realize until I really got into this is that when information enters the eyes, it's in nothing like the form that we think we're looking at around us.
[01:18:43.690 --> 01:18:48.173]  That only, that's constructed in our mind, and only... Hey, watch, stay there, we got a break.
[01:18:48.213 --> 01:18:48.773]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:54.016 --> 01:18:55.058]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:18:55.378 --> 01:18:58.163]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:18:58.443 --> 01:19:02.589]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:03.851]  So what do you do?
[01:19:04.172 --> 01:19:08.739]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:19:09.215 --> 01:19:11.336]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:19:11.837 --> 01:19:26.525]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:19:26.565 --> 01:19:33.689]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[01:19:51.942 --> 01:19:53.464]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:19:53.624 --> 01:19:54.785]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:19:54.925 --> 01:19:58.367]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:19:58.447 --> 01:19:58.908]  Phenol!
[01:19:59.208 --> 01:20:06.273]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:20:06.954 --> 01:20:10.676]  The FDA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:20:10.816 --> 01:20:11.256]  Fragrance?
[01:20:11.636 --> 01:20:16.398]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:20:16.538 --> 01:20:21.220]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:23.861]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Calden shampoo.
[01:20:24.261 --> 01:20:27.663]  Well, like all of the products from the Kalben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:31.364]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.

[01:20:53.547 --> 01:20:55.327]  Jack Brownring for Midas Resources.
[01:20:55.827 --> 01:20:59.248]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[01:20:59.748 --> 01:21:00.408]  Let's update.
[01:21:00.928 --> 01:21:04.389]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[01:21:05.049 --> 01:21:08.770]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[01:21:09.450 --> 01:21:10.390]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:12.750]  dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:14.171]  Today, the U.S.
[01:21:14.191 --> 01:21:16.431]  dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[01:21:16.831 --> 01:21:18.351]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[01:21:18.931 --> 01:21:20.892]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283.
[01:21:22.253 --> 01:21:27.114]  January of 04, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[01:21:28.114 --> 01:21:30.274]  Gold is moving, equities are treading water.
[01:21:30.675 --> 01:21:33.315]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[01:21:33.875 --> 01:21:35.235]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[01:21:35.675 --> 01:21:37.396]  Physical possession, private gold.
[01:21:37.816 --> 01:21:39.776]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.

[01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:04.354]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:22:04.594 --> 01:22:11.621]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:22:12.001 --> 01:22:18.107]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:22:18.247 --> 01:22:19.468]  There are no side effects.
[01:22:19.808 --> 01:22:22.750]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:24.911]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.

[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.200]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:06.941]  Alright, here's what I'm going to do.

[01:23:20.286 --> 01:23:24.268]  So we'll take calls and go back into discussion and then go back to calls.
[01:23:24.288 --> 01:23:26.329]  But each caller has got about a minute or so.
[01:23:26.389 --> 01:23:30.551]  A question, a comment, something you want to get into with David Eich or myself.
[01:23:31.251 --> 01:23:32.652]  David, let's go ahead and go to these calls.
[01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:51.964]  I'd like to come back to what I was saying before the break there, because this is fundamental to how we're manipulated, the way our reality is constructed, by external implantation of our beliefs, and basically we're like a subject on the stage of a stage hypnotist.
[01:23:51.984 --> 01:24:01.686]  We're having false beliefs put into our minds, largely on a subconscious level, and then we see the world in line with those beliefs, in the same way as someone on a stage can be
[01:24:02.495 --> 01:24:10.800]  Manipulated by a hypnotist to see an elephant in the audience, so we can be manipulated to see, you know, terrorists where they're not.
[01:24:12.061 --> 01:24:13.241]  Oh, I totally agree with you.
[01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:15.963]  Paul in Delaware, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:24:15.983 --> 01:24:17.544]  Hi, gentlemen.
[01:24:17.964 --> 01:24:20.065]  It's nice to speak with you, David Icke.
[01:24:20.205 --> 01:24:20.825]  Hi, Paul.
[01:24:22.747 --> 01:24:30.511]  I really appreciate a lot of your work, and Alex, first I'd like to say, the definition of insanity
[01:24:31.391 --> 01:24:39.833]  is a Christian that believes in evolution, that believes in psychics, that believes in UFOs, that believes in reptiles, that believes in wormholes.
[01:24:40.274 --> 01:24:41.314]  That's insanity!
[01:24:42.194 --> 01:24:46.195]  Now, also, we're talking about the Matrix.
[01:24:47.276 --> 01:24:48.436]  Well, I look at the Matrix.
[01:24:48.456 --> 01:24:50.116]  You guys are reading a lot into the Matrix.
[01:24:50.676 --> 01:24:59.459]  I look at the Matrix as I do as the Skulls movies 1, 2, and 3, Tomb Raider, and the upcoming National Treasure with Nicolas Cage.
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:04.302]  Now, you were saying about, oh, how they're going to want to work with us, the smart people.
[01:25:04.562 --> 01:25:06.823]  Well, no, I was saying that's propaganda.
[01:25:06.843 --> 01:25:08.924]  I was going to get more into that.
[01:25:09.064 --> 01:25:20.629]  Yeah, it is definitely propaganda, because don't think for a second that the people who are aware that you can read anything into that movie other than more conditioning and manipulation.
[01:25:21.089 --> 01:25:28.212]  And as Dr. Khalid Mohammed said, not that I'm a follower, but I have heard him speak before, we really want to work with you.
[01:25:28.292 --> 01:25:29.413]  We want to work with you.
[01:25:29.952 --> 01:25:35.227]  That's how he feels about the white people and I feel the same way if you want to read something into this movie.
[01:25:36.062 --> 01:25:38.483]  Okay, sir, that's your phone call.
[01:25:38.583 --> 01:25:41.884]  I'm going to let you go, because I said we've got to be fair to the callers.
[01:25:41.904 --> 01:25:44.345]  Let me get David Icke's response to what you were saying.
[01:25:44.405 --> 01:25:47.987]  What I was talking about, sir, is mass conditioning.
[01:25:48.127 --> 01:25:57.471]  As I've said over and over again, is that that's what the New World Order says, is that we'll see the world's a dangerous place, and we've got to have a world government to keep everybody safe.
[01:25:57.531 --> 01:26:03.173]  And those of you that are thinking people see this, and we've got to be more ruthless than anybody else, or we'll lose control.
[01:26:03.913 --> 01:26:19.179]  Obviously, I said that that movie, that third movie, is definitely bad, and has a bad message, and I said that, and then you spun that into something different than what I said, and then you mentioned, you know, Khalid Mohamed, who I've got on video saying horrible stuff.
[01:26:19.779 --> 01:26:22.480]  You know, I mean, we've got to come together against the New World Order.
[01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:22.960]  David Icke?
[01:26:23.621 --> 01:26:29.403]  Yeah, when I talk about The Matrix, I'm talking about the first one, which gave an excellent visual portrayal of
[01:26:30.396 --> 01:26:39.679]  The illusory world that we live in, and provably live in, when you look at even mainstream science, there's no way that this world is anything but an illusion that we construct in our minds.
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:46.882]  Therefore, if you can control what we believe to be real, you will control what we construct to be real.
[01:26:47.062 --> 01:26:52.324]  Well, the Bible says we're made in the image of God, and that we're creators.
[01:26:52.444 --> 01:26:54.525]  And look, we go out and build things.
[01:26:54.545 --> 01:27:00.107]  The things that people thought up 50 years ago, 100 years ago, we have now developed and created.
[01:27:01.299 --> 01:27:12.366]  Yeah, but the whole point that needs to get across is that we are constructing the reality we think is real according to our own belief in what is real.
[01:27:12.446 --> 01:27:22.372]  Therefore, like a stage hypnotist, if you can manipulate people to believe in a certain reality, you will get them to experience that reality because they'll construct it.
[01:27:22.692 --> 01:27:28.816]  And of course, we have the greatest stage hypnotist on planet Earth in the corner of every room, every living room, the television.
[01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:33.503]  Which is constantly implanting a false belief in reality.
[01:27:33.523 --> 01:27:34.324]  Let's take some calls!
[01:27:34.504 --> 01:27:35.304]  Let's take some calls!
[01:27:35.344 --> 01:27:41.529]  ...ignorantly doing it, too, who are not aware, who are bringing up our children, saying, this is what is real, this is what is not real.
[01:27:41.769 --> 01:27:44.051]  We're being hypnotized all the time without realizing it.
[01:27:44.451 --> 01:27:45.312]  Jim in Ohio.
[01:27:45.332 --> 01:27:45.992]  Go ahead, Jim.
[01:27:47.493 --> 01:27:49.775]  Okay, Charles in North Carolina.
[01:27:49.795 --> 01:27:50.736]  Charles, you're on the air.
[01:27:50.936 --> 01:27:51.576]  Yeah, David.
[01:27:51.696 --> 01:27:56.700]  In your book, Children in the Matrix, on page 207, you write, and I quote, there was no Jesus.
[01:27:57.182 --> 01:28:00.223]  And on page 61 you write, Jesus never really existed.
[01:28:00.723 --> 01:28:06.065]  Then you go on to argue that Jesus was a mythological creation of shape-shifting reptilian lizard people.
[01:28:06.406 --> 01:28:08.246]  And you want to talk about false impressions?
[01:28:08.666 --> 01:28:16.769]  While all of Alex Jones' work is based on verifiable facts like the Northwood document, your analysis mixes facts with blasphemous fiction revealing you!
[01:28:16.789 --> 01:28:20.711]  With satanic motivations you have, you are a fraud, Mr. Ike.
[01:28:21.051 --> 01:28:22.472]  Well, believe something else then, mate.
[01:28:22.632 --> 01:28:23.312]  Don't matter to me.
[01:28:24.419 --> 01:28:27.982]  Why should I care?
[01:28:28.103 --> 01:28:32.686]  I'll tell you what, I hadn't read that, but I'd like to talk about that with David Icahn when we get back.
[01:28:32.727 --> 01:28:33.908]  And I knew these calls would come up.
[01:28:34.548 --> 01:28:35.809]  You guys want a David Icahn?
[01:28:35.849 --> 01:28:36.750]  He's on the broadcast.
[01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:37.971]  We'll discuss it when we get back.
[01:28:37.991 --> 01:28:38.431]  Stay with us.
[01:28:42.775 --> 01:28:43.696]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.176 --> 01:28:45.778]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.698 --> 01:28:49.401]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.365 --> 01:28:58.588]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:28:58.748 --> 01:29:06.831]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:29:07.092 --> 01:29:14.135]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:29:14.335 --> 01:29:15.596]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:29:15.696 --> 01:29:21.580]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:26.864]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:29:26.984 --> 01:29:35.870]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:29:36.130 --> 01:29:39.413]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:29:41.674 --> 01:29:44.036]  Call now and get free shipping!
[01:29:52.625 --> 01:29:54.306]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:29:54.406 --> 01:29:56.908]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[01:29:57.089 --> 01:29:57.789]  It feels great.
[01:29:57.969 --> 01:29:58.990]  Absolutely wonderful.
[01:29:59.090 --> 01:30:04.635]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:30:04.935 --> 01:30:06.456]  Kimberly, tell us about your success.
[01:30:06.716 --> 01:30:09.098]  Okay, I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[01:30:09.238 --> 01:30:12.321]  I've lost 16 pounds and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[01:30:13.022 --> 01:30:14.624]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[01:30:14.644 --> 01:30:18.348]  I have a 21-month-old child, and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[01:30:18.508 --> 01:30:19.249]  That's for sure.
[01:30:19.409 --> 01:30:19.990]  Was it easy?
[01:30:20.210 --> 01:30:20.831]  Very easy.
[01:30:20.871 --> 01:30:21.752]  I mean, there's nothing to it.
[01:30:21.772 --> 01:30:26.937]  You can actually still continue to eat meals with your children and not starve yourself or anything else and lose weight.
[01:30:27.398 --> 01:30:28.018]  We're good to go!
[01:30:52.814 --> 01:30:53.814]  It's finally here!
[01:30:53.954 --> 01:30:54.935]  Spring has arrived!
[01:30:55.115 --> 01:30:58.075]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:30:58.295 --> 01:31:01.756]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:31:01.976 --> 01:31:10.118]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[01:31:10.398 --> 01:31:14.119]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[01:31:14.319 --> 01:31:19.340]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:24.123]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[01:31:24.323 --> 01:31:28.386]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[01:31:28.466 --> 01:31:35.611]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn!
[01:31:35.911 --> 01:31:41.376]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious, secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.

[01:31:43.298 --> 01:31:44.499]  That's 1-800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com today.
[01:32:03.895 --> 01:32:09.997]  Alright, we're about to go back to David Icke and let him answer those comments that Charles was bringing up.
[01:32:10.177 --> 01:32:11.878]  By the way, I was going to hold over, but he hung up.
[01:32:13.359 --> 01:32:21.722]  And then we'll get to all the folks that are patiently holding Greg Randy, Brooke, Heather, Mike, and many, many others.
[01:32:22.822 --> 01:32:43.043]  Before I go back to David Icke, just briefly, prisonplanet.tv, all my best radio interviews are there each week, my weekly television show, my special reports are posted each week, generally one special report, sometimes two special reports, all my videos, a bunch of other great videos that we've gotten authorization to post, my book, Paul Watson's book,
[01:32:43.757 --> 01:32:48.359]  For 15 cents a day if you sign up for a year, 19 cents a day if you sign up for a month.
[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:51.881]  PrisonPlanet.tv for those of you that are online.
[01:32:52.181 --> 01:32:57.124]  To stop the building of this prison planet, we're just trying to get people to think, to think outside the box.
[01:32:57.244 --> 01:32:59.625]  Also, I've made 10 films.
[01:33:00.266 --> 01:33:02.347]  One of them is Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:33:03.007 --> 01:33:06.149]  Our so-called Christian conservative leaders engaging in Moloch worship.
[01:33:07.630 --> 01:33:11.632]  You know, Leviticus, give not your children to the fires of Moloch.
[01:33:11.712 --> 01:33:12.192]  Ezekiel,
[01:33:13.522 --> 01:33:14.543]  This is the real deal.
[01:33:14.764 --> 01:33:19.089]  Our world leaders do believe in the devil, do believe in Satanism, and I am a Christian.
[01:33:19.109 --> 01:33:22.493]  Does that mean I'm one of these Christians that says the Patriot Act's good and world government's good?
[01:33:22.593 --> 01:33:22.813]  No.
[01:33:24.876 --> 01:33:27.639]  And I disagree with David if he indeed wrote that in that book, which I haven't read.
[01:33:27.659 --> 01:33:28.780]  We'll talk about that in a second.
[01:33:29.121 --> 01:33:32.505]  But I hope people will get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:33:33.098 --> 01:33:38.943]  I hope you'll get 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State, Three Total Enslavement, my film, The Matrix of Evil.
[01:33:39.443 --> 01:33:45.948]  They're all incredible videos, $25.95 apiece, all over two hours, $20 if you order three or more of any of the ten titles.
[01:33:46.889 --> 01:33:49.711]  And I also carry George Humphrey's new video that I think is just amazing, 9-11.
[01:33:51.599 --> 01:34:01.604]  The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati, and it's $19.95 with a color 80-plus page booklet that comes with it with all the documents and photos and information.
[01:34:02.024 --> 01:34:07.446]  Get a second copy for $14.95, so that's two videos and three copies of the book for $34.95.
[01:34:07.566 --> 01:34:08.567]  We carry Eric Hoffman's video.
[01:34:12.845 --> 01:34:16.366]  Painful Deceptions, Exposing 9-11.
[01:34:16.706 --> 01:34:18.647]  These are all videos you've got to get.
[01:34:18.667 --> 01:34:22.388]  When you get my videos, the 10 I've made, you're authorized to make copies of them and spread the word.
[01:34:22.708 --> 01:34:25.489]  The toll-free number to order, take action, is 1-888-253-3139.
[01:34:31.511 --> 01:34:35.454]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:34:35.474 --> 01:34:43.940]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:50.464]  Or you can go to prisonplanet.com or infowars.com to order via the Safe Secure Shopping Cart.
[01:34:50.505 --> 01:34:57.009]  So again, that's 888-253-3139 or infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[01:34:57.349 --> 01:35:00.912]  Now Nathan, before you respond to what that guy was saying earlier,
[01:35:01.738 --> 01:35:04.440]  I think some of it are valid questions.
[01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:09.902]  But before you do that, will you tell us about some of your books and videos on your website?
[01:35:11.603 --> 01:35:15.906]  Well, I've written a number of books over the last 10-15 years or so.
[01:35:15.946 --> 01:35:18.187]  The latest one is called Tales from the Time Loop.
[01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:22.361]  One before that was called, uh, Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster.
[01:35:22.822 --> 01:35:27.743]  Then there's Children of the Matrix, uh, The Biggest Secret, and, uh, And the Truth Shall Set You Free.
[01:35:28.424 --> 01:35:31.305]  Um, and my, uh, my website is davideike.com.
[01:35:31.385 --> 01:35:36.927]  Ike is I-C-K-E, uh, which has about 5,000 webpages now on various subjects.
[01:35:36.987 --> 01:35:38.167]  It's updated almost every day.
[01:35:38.968 --> 01:35:47.411]  And, um, you know, it's just a vehicle for, um, uh, information that people want to get through the mainstream media to, uh, to be, um, to filter and,
[01:35:47.955 --> 01:35:54.881]  People look at it and decide what they want to think about it and that's really the point I would make in response to Charles.
[01:35:54.941 --> 01:36:02.066]  I'm actually glad that he rang up and in a way I'm glad he said what he said because it's a very very important point.
[01:36:04.048 --> 01:36:08.872]  The foundation of any tyranny is to divide and rule the population.
[01:36:09.753 --> 01:36:14.957]  To provide fault lines through which you can play off one side against another.
[01:36:15.893 --> 01:36:32.308]  One belief off against another, one political system off against another, just as they played communism off against so-called capitalism, cartelism in truth, and without telling us that the same force was actually manipulating both sides.
[01:36:33.389 --> 01:36:41.356]  If we are going to live in a world of true freedom, then there's one fundamental to that, and that is we have to be at peace
[01:36:42.105 --> 01:36:49.611]  With other people believing different things to us, so long as they don't seek to impose it on anybody and force them to believe the same.
[01:36:50.211 --> 01:36:52.052]  That's when the tyrannical stuff comes in.
[01:36:52.073 --> 01:36:52.873]  Okay, I gotta stop you.
[01:36:52.973 --> 01:36:53.914]  I gotta stop you, David.
[01:36:54.755 --> 01:37:03.341]  Now, the United Nations says they want a one-world religion where you can believe whatever you want as long as you quote, don't impose it, but then they're gonna impose that view.
[01:37:03.881 --> 01:37:09.265]  Yes, but I'm talking about that without imposition.
[01:37:09.546 --> 01:37:11.347]  I mean, how can you have freedom
[01:37:11.974 --> 01:37:16.337]  If one belief is imposing itself in any way on another, you can't!
[01:37:17.297 --> 01:37:17.918]  Freedom!
[01:37:18.258 --> 01:37:23.881]  A lot of people can't cope with freedom because they think freedom is the freedom to impose what they believe on other people.
[01:37:23.921 --> 01:37:37.090]  Well, David, I'm not saying that, but at the same time, you know, they arrest people in Europe now, and even in the U.S., you criticize homosexuality because they say, oh, that hurts somebody's feelings and that could cause hate.
[01:37:37.930 --> 01:37:40.892]  No, but that's different to imposing something on people.
[01:37:41.332 --> 01:37:54.329]  If you have heterosexuality seeking to impose itself on homosexuality by saying, uh, we're gonna outlaw it, we can't do it, we're gonna throw you in prison if you get found doing it and all that stuff, that's what I'm talking about.
[01:37:54.349 --> 01:37:55.230]  We have the opposite.
[01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:59.075]  We have the homosexuality being sold and imposed on the general public.
[01:37:59.635 --> 01:38:06.417]  Well, if that's happening, that also breaks the rules of my version and definition of freedom.
[01:38:06.437 --> 01:38:11.238]  Okay, David, since this all came up, because I've read your book about 9-11, I think it's excellent.
[01:38:13.298 --> 01:38:18.259]  I don't get into things I can't prove, which you got into in The Biggest Secret, which I didn't read.
[01:38:18.279 --> 01:38:21.600]  I didn't read The Children of the Matrix, which the caller was calling in about.
[01:38:22.425 --> 01:38:28.809]  But I have to tell you that I stick to the things I can prove, and I've been highly effective at that.
[01:38:28.849 --> 01:38:30.730]  You're very articulate, very intelligent.
[01:38:31.090 --> 01:38:32.290]  You work for the BBC.
[01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:33.751]  You were a championship goalie.
[01:38:34.051 --> 01:38:35.752]  We should talk about your past.
[01:38:35.772 --> 01:38:39.014]  You're a very interesting, articulate individual.
[01:38:39.334 --> 01:38:44.437]  But I've told you on air before that I don't think it does...
[01:38:45.117 --> 01:38:54.363]  Good, in the big picture, to go into things that you can't prove, add it on to all this real stuff, because then it discredits all the stuff we can document.
[01:38:54.663 --> 01:38:55.944]  So, what can't I prove?
[01:38:55.964 --> 01:38:56.964]  That Jesus didn't exist?
[01:38:57.985 --> 01:39:00.747]  Well, clearly, the Roman historians, I mean, all of it.
[01:39:00.787 --> 01:39:03.989]  I mean, clearly Jesus Christ existed.
[01:39:04.009 --> 01:39:09.452]  Well, that's like saying prove George Washington did, or, you know, prove Mary, Queen of France.
[01:39:09.532 --> 01:39:14.215]  I think if you go into this more deeply, you'll find that there's enormous amounts of evidence
[01:39:15.290 --> 01:39:26.172]  That the story of Jesus, sometimes in detail, is a story that can be found thousands of years later.
[01:39:26.192 --> 01:39:29.273]  Yeah, I know, you'll claim the Egyptians and the Babylonians have similar myths.
[01:39:29.693 --> 01:39:31.854]  Yeah, all over the world they have similar myths.
[01:39:31.874 --> 01:39:34.614]  That doesn't do it.
[01:39:34.654 --> 01:39:36.335]  Well, don't accept the evidence then.
[01:39:36.935 --> 01:39:38.795]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:39:38.935 --> 01:39:42.596]  You believe in Jesus, fine, go ahead, don't matter to me.
[01:39:43.713 --> 01:39:46.034]  Why should me not believing in Jesus matter to anybody?
[01:39:46.875 --> 01:39:48.696]  Because, what did we talk about earlier?
[01:39:49.297 --> 01:40:07.571]  We talked about the fact that in the end, all of us, no matter what our beliefs, religiously, politically, in any way, shape or form, in the end, we're all cackle to this agenda of destroying the freedom, not just of non-Jesus believers or Jesus believers, but all of us.
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:23.243]  Surely, we should put aside what we don't believe or agree on, and unite behind what we do, which is the freedom of all of us to have and express our beliefs, whatever they are, so long as they're not imposed on others.
[01:40:23.743 --> 01:40:35.085]  And anyone that seeks to impose on me that I should believe in this, or believe in that, or otherwise I'm Satan, and all this very idiotic, very nonsense, is just playing the game
[01:40:37.921 --> 01:40:40.463]  Okay, let me add something here, David.
[01:40:41.944 --> 01:40:46.767]  Okay, I've studied the New World Order for a decade, a little over a decade now, I've been active for a decade.
[01:40:47.647 --> 01:40:57.793]  And every time I follow up to the highest levels of the New World Order, they believe in Lucifer, they believe in the devil, they seek to infiltrate Christianity, they seek to discredit it.
[01:41:00.217 --> 01:41:03.119]  In your book, you write about my infiltration of Bohemian Grove.
[01:41:03.159 --> 01:41:04.000]  You talk about that.
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:05.120]  You've talked about that on your website.
[01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:06.261]  You've talked about that in interviews.
[01:41:06.782 --> 01:41:11.785]  Now, is it not true that every time you research the New World Order, it leads back to Satanism?
[01:41:11.965 --> 01:41:15.047]  Well, then what does that mean?
[01:41:15.107 --> 01:41:20.231]  Because the Bible tells me there's going to be a world leader who is the devil and who hates Christians.
[01:41:20.871 --> 01:41:24.774]  Now look, that is enforcing my belief.
[01:41:26.638 --> 01:41:33.164]  Well, if that reinforces your belief in Christianity, Alex, then believe in Christianity... Well, my own experiences have, too.
[01:41:33.204 --> 01:41:36.006]  I mean, I know God works in my life, but... Fine!
[01:41:36.026 --> 01:41:37.568]  But hold on, I mean, that's a real question.
[01:41:37.788 --> 01:41:39.529]  You know the globalists are devil worshippers.
[01:41:39.870 --> 01:41:43.973]  Now, why do they believe in the devil if you're saying Jesus doesn't exist?
[01:41:45.194 --> 01:41:53.782]  Well, explain to me why Jesus existing or not existing relates to them worshipping a negative dark force, which they do.
[01:41:55.291 --> 01:42:02.633]  You're telling me that, by necessity, Jesus has to be a polarity of what they worship?
[01:42:02.953 --> 01:42:07.835]  Why can't there be just another state of consciousness?
[01:42:08.255 --> 01:42:11.036]  A state of love as opposed to a state of hate?
[01:42:11.456 --> 01:42:15.737]  A state of peace as opposed to a state of conflict?
[01:42:15.817 --> 01:42:21.239]  Why does that love, which they are trying to destroy,
[01:42:21.941 --> 01:42:27.764]  Why, and why out of human consciousness, why does that love have to be called Jesus?
[01:42:27.824 --> 01:42:30.505]  Why can't it just be called love or any other name?
[01:42:30.965 --> 01:42:40.990]  Okay, David, we're about to go back to calls here in a second, and people will probably take us in a hundred different directions, but I want to get back to something I raised with the Matrix earlier.
[01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.490]  Right.
[01:42:42.230 --> 01:42:51.626]  I clearly said that overall the first film gives us a good analogy or parallel to what's going on, at least psychologically and mentally, at a lot of different levels.
[01:42:51.947 --> 01:42:56.154]  The second one, then it gets into the Illuminati, the New World Order, and the third one it has this terrible message.
[01:42:57.832 --> 01:43:09.536]  You know, we sit down with the great architect, that Masonic term for Lucifer, and the architect, you know, the guy with the white beard, you know, the shaman archetype, sits there and tells us, look, you're going to destroy everything if you do this.
[01:43:09.596 --> 01:43:10.977]  Some people want the Matrix.
[01:43:11.417 --> 01:43:19.100]  You can have, you know, your free will in this, trying to counterfeit what the God of the Bible says if you've got free will.
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:36.984]  So, and what I was going to elaborate on is that's what the Illuminati says to professors and intelligent people is, we've got to be more ruthless than anybody else because if we aren't, other people will get those technologies and then they'll destroy the planet or they'll unseat our elite, join us and be part of the power structure.
[01:43:37.245 --> 01:43:40.105]  That's why I was saying that message is so dangerous.
[01:43:40.185 --> 01:43:42.786]  Do you have any comments on that?
[01:43:44.477 --> 01:43:55.964]  Well, the way that we're being mind manipulated through fear is and does take endless manifestations and what you're describing is one of them.
[01:43:56.825 --> 01:44:08.592]  I've met and read accounts of friends of people in high places in the university structure, both in this country and America for instance, who unknowingly
[01:44:09.557 --> 01:44:25.400]  Teaching and standing by doctrines and beliefs that they know to be false, because if they don't, then they're going to lose their job, and they're going to lose their funding, and they're going to lose their sense of who they are in the community.
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:29.281]  What I would say to those people is what I said earlier.
[01:44:29.601 --> 01:44:33.861]  At the end of your life, is that going to make you feel good about yourself?
[01:44:34.361 --> 01:44:36.982]  Or will you feel better about yourself if you say,
[01:44:37.808 --> 01:44:41.931]  I'm going to do what I believe to be right, no matter what the consequences.
[01:44:41.971 --> 01:44:43.532]  I'm not going to think about consequences.
[01:44:43.572 --> 01:44:45.033]  I'm going to do what I believe to be right.
[01:44:45.474 --> 01:45:04.988]  And, you know, we would change this world, Alex, overnight, if people, particularly those in key places who are not advancing this agenda through awareness or design, but by just taking part in it and playing a part in it because it suits them and suits what they want.
[01:45:05.438 --> 01:45:06.160]  I don't think so.
[01:45:17.387 --> 01:45:17.727]  I think?
[01:45:37.839 --> 01:45:38.279]  I don't know.
[01:45:54.637 --> 01:45:57.099]  Who's just going to do what the Master tells him?
[01:45:57.479 --> 01:45:59.800]  Or am I going to stand up for what I believe in?
[01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:02.302]  Express the full magnitude of who I am?
[01:46:02.322 --> 01:46:04.163]  Well, I've just got to tell you, David.
[01:46:04.183 --> 01:46:05.924]  We've got to go to calls.
[01:46:06.184 --> 01:46:07.185]  Then we've got to go to calls.
[01:46:07.885 --> 01:46:12.828]  I just want you to know that I, in my own experience, see the New World Order attack real Christians.
[01:46:13.228 --> 01:46:14.389]  That's their real focus.
[01:46:14.429 --> 01:46:16.370]  And they tell you to believe whatever else you want.
[01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:26.817]  Just don't be a real Christian, and I see real Christians at the forefront of fighting the New World Order effectively, and I see FEMA gearing up to go after real Christians.
[01:46:27.217 --> 01:46:38.746]  Now, a lot of people in the whole New Age movement see these Neo-Con Christians, who are totally deceived, serving the New World Order beast system, and then a lot of people in your camp see that and think, oh, it must all be a fraud.
[01:46:39.026 --> 01:46:43.449]  And I'm telling you... Alex, the New Age is just another manufactured religion.
[01:46:44.252 --> 01:46:47.534]  You know, it's not Christianity that I don't follow.
[01:46:47.554 --> 01:46:49.154]  I don't follow any religion.
[01:46:49.595 --> 01:46:50.075]  None of them!
[01:46:50.695 --> 01:46:54.857]  They're just structures of imposing a belief system, in my view, and I have a right to that.
[01:46:55.197 --> 01:47:04.402]  But people who think something differently, if they believe in freedom and they're a Christian, or they believe in freedom and they go round in New Age bloody clothes, I'm with them!
[01:47:04.952 --> 01:47:15.461]  Because we need to realize that we agree on what affects us all and not be divided and ruled by arguing among ourselves about whether that belief is right or that belief is wrong.
[01:47:15.481 --> 01:47:15.981]  Okay, okay.
[01:47:16.221 --> 01:47:18.103]  Alright, let's go to calls here.
[01:47:18.143 --> 01:47:20.845]  Let's go ahead now, up next, and go to Greg in Texas.
[01:47:20.885 --> 01:47:21.646]  Greg, go ahead.
[01:47:22.226 --> 01:47:23.367]  Yes, thank you so much.
[01:47:23.807 --> 01:47:25.969]  Just a quick comment and a quicker question.
[01:47:26.990 --> 01:47:30.353]  Mr. Icke, it's an honor to talk to you again.
[01:47:30.473 --> 01:47:32.875]  Last year I spoke with you on the Lou Gentil Show.
[01:47:33.453 --> 01:47:37.194]  Right before Texas City, I was able to go and see you then.
[01:47:37.214 --> 01:47:40.235]  And it was an amazing experience.
[01:47:41.196 --> 01:47:49.378]  And it's my belief that the moment that we're in, I know that time isn't real, but time is getting away from us.
[01:47:50.299 --> 01:47:55.660]  And I don't buy into these illusions of right and left.
[01:47:56.441 --> 01:48:02.423]  What can someone do to make a commitment to do their part in all this?
[01:48:03.877 --> 01:48:08.080]  Aside from intention, what do you recommend?
[01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:17.565]  Because I think now is the time, and I didn't ask you this last time on Lou Gentile, but I have to ask you now, what can someone do who is committed to do their part in all this?
[01:48:17.605 --> 01:48:19.206]  Okay, thanks for the call, David.
[01:48:19.947 --> 01:48:25.630]  Well, I would say, Greg, that you said the word there, in my experience, intent.
[01:48:26.951 --> 01:48:32.534]  What I've found in my life, and I know a lot of other people have too, is when you really commit yourself to something.
[01:48:33.290 --> 01:48:34.571]  With the intent of doing it.
[01:48:34.811 --> 01:48:43.176]  My intent is I want to serve the cause of freedom in every way I possibly can, in the most effective way I possibly can.
[01:48:43.576 --> 01:49:01.047]  If you do that, what starts to happen is people, and this is what happened to me, people and events and experiences start coming into your life, apparently coincidentally, that allow you to walk that road of making that contribution to
[01:49:02.106 --> 01:49:02.527]  I think so.
[01:49:18.564 --> 01:49:25.951]  Whenever my head, my intellect, says one thing and my intuition says another, my feeling, this is what I feel to do.
[01:49:26.252 --> 01:49:31.477]  Oh no, you can't do that, you've got a mortgage, you've got a cat, says the intellect, which is always trying to keep us in the prison.
[01:49:32.418 --> 01:49:40.045]  If you follow your intuition, your feeling, then you suddenly find that life starts to put the riches in front of you.
[01:49:40.504 --> 01:49:48.006]  And so, I started in the early 1990s whenever my intellect said, no, you can't do that with all the belief- We got a break!
[01:49:48.026 --> 01:49:48.806]  We got a break!
[01:49:49.026 --> 01:49:49.706]  We got a break!

[01:51:10.868 --> 01:51:15.410]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:51:15.630 --> 01:51:22.772]  The cashless society control grid, impenetrable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:51:22.792 --> 01:51:23.592]  soil, the U.S.A.
[01:51:23.612 --> 01:51:27.334]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:51:27.494 --> 01:51:30.014]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:51:30.235 --> 01:51:36.937]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[01:52:15.032 --> 01:52:34.221]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones, as well as power for small applications.
[01:52:34.442 --> 01:52:38.063]  Get the one-stop solution for your emergency and everyday needs.
[01:52:38.203 --> 01:52:39.464]  The Berkey Security Pack.
[01:52:39.624 --> 01:52:40.885]  A retail value of $518 for only $399.
[01:52:43.726 --> 01:52:47.127]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:52:47.147 --> 01:52:49.907]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:52:56.229 --> 01:53:02.270]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:05.890]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:08.971 --> 01:53:10.751]  We're talking to David Aikoush.
[01:53:10.771 --> 01:53:13.372]  In a way, kind of an enigma.
[01:53:15.399 --> 01:53:37.192]  Because so much of what he talks about and goes over is fluent, well-spoken, intelligent, focused, charismatic, documented, and then he goes into, you know, we secretly have these dimensional creatures controlling us from a higher level, and Jesus Christ wasn't Jesus, or didn't exist, and I disagree with that.
[01:53:39.053 --> 01:53:42.896]  But a lot of people follow David Icke, and we have him here on the show, and I appreciate him coming on.
[01:53:43.376 --> 01:53:44.797]  We have him on, I guess, about once a year.
[01:53:45.735 --> 01:53:47.637]  And we appreciate him spending this time with us.
[01:53:47.697 --> 01:53:49.978]  I know we need to get the calls a little bit quicker here.
[01:53:49.999 --> 01:53:51.179]  We're going to try to.
[01:53:51.219 --> 01:53:52.480]  He'll be with us into the next hour.
[01:53:53.021 --> 01:54:01.748]  But David, I never saw this, so I don't know if it's true, but I have read in mainstream news reports that when you first started waking up, what was it, 1994?
[01:54:01.788 --> 01:54:02.108]  Was it 93?
[01:54:02.208 --> 01:54:02.568]  No, no, early 90s.
[01:54:02.588 --> 01:54:02.568]  1991.
[01:54:02.849 --> 01:54:06.552]  Okay, when is it true that you went on the BBC and announced that you were Jesus?
[01:54:16.034 --> 01:54:18.876]  No, I think that's not quite what I said.
[01:54:19.757 --> 01:54:41.754]  What I said in my own words in those days was what quantum physicists are saying, which is everything is the same energy, everything is the same consciousness, it's just expressing itself in different ways, and therefore if you want to use symbolic language, we're all the sons and daughters of God, and this got portrayed in the way
[01:54:43.125 --> 01:54:48.187]  That most things in the mainstream media get betrayed in a way that it wasn't said, it wasn't meant to.
[01:54:50.088 --> 01:54:51.068]  But you have to live with that.
[01:54:51.108 --> 01:54:57.591]  If you're saying things in the public eye that challenge mainstream beliefs, then you're going to get ridiculed.
[01:54:57.791 --> 01:54:59.352]  Well, I never saw it.
[01:54:59.612 --> 01:55:04.574]  I've had the media lie about me, so that's why I brought that up.
[01:55:04.594 --> 01:55:07.435]  I'm just saying basically the same thing in a different language these days.
[01:55:08.684 --> 01:55:13.188]  We're all one consciousness, and we're all expressing ourselves in different ways.
[01:55:13.988 --> 01:55:31.942]  We're all one, but we're all the diversity of the one, if you like, and we should start celebrating diversity instead of scorning it and seeking to impose one belief upon a diverse population, and that's what the New World Order wants.
[01:55:32.522 --> 01:55:37.984]  Actually, in the name of diversity, they go after people being individuals.
[01:55:38.284 --> 01:55:39.945]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:55:40.285 --> 01:55:45.427]  Let's talk to Randy in Pennsylvania, and then we'll go to Mike and Rich and Tim and others, and Anthony.
[01:55:46.468 --> 01:55:47.208]  Randy, go ahead.
[01:55:47.648 --> 01:55:48.168]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:55:48.669 --> 01:55:49.069]  Hi, David.
[01:55:49.429 --> 01:55:49.909]  Hello, Randy.
[01:55:50.169 --> 01:55:51.410]  It's truly an honor to speak with you.
[01:55:51.790 --> 01:55:52.150]  Thank you.
[01:55:52.850 --> 01:55:56.772]  I don't want to put any words in your mouth, but I believe you believe things the way I think, and that we are God.
[01:55:57.072 --> 01:55:57.592]  We're the devil.
[01:55:58.253 --> 01:56:01.714]  In fact, we're all connected, and this reality is, in essence, a living hologram.
[01:56:02.578 --> 01:56:02.738]  Yeah.
[01:56:02.999 --> 01:56:10.047]  Could you speak to the audience about quantum physics a little more and the way that our eyes work and the solution to this problem that the hell that we're living in?
[01:56:10.067 --> 01:56:11.769]  Because I believe this is hell or heaven.
[01:56:12.509 --> 01:56:14.671]  A hundred months of syndrome.
[01:56:15.151 --> 01:56:16.312]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[01:56:16.332 --> 01:56:19.995]  You can say it in New Age, but it sure sounds like that to me.
[01:56:20.055 --> 01:56:20.535]  Go ahead.
[01:56:20.815 --> 01:56:21.055]  Right.
[01:56:21.255 --> 01:56:27.840]  Well, again, you know, why does anyone have to put a label on everything?
[01:56:27.900 --> 01:56:30.402]  Well, dummy, no, there are real things.
[01:56:30.462 --> 01:56:33.044]  Hey, David, David, David, David.
[01:56:33.064 --> 01:56:34.585]  There are real things in the world.
[01:56:36.403 --> 01:56:38.725]  You know, I have to put a name to it all the time.
[01:56:38.745 --> 01:56:43.009]  I'm not New Age, I just believe certain things, which are unique to me in many ways.
[01:56:43.029 --> 01:56:43.910]  I hope they are.
[01:56:43.930 --> 01:56:45.371]  Well, let me say this.
[01:56:46.272 --> 01:56:52.237]  If I walk up to somebody, or they walk up to me and hit me in the head with a ball-peen hammer and kill me, that's a real event.
[01:56:52.958 --> 01:56:55.080]  And so we have to put labels on things.
[01:56:56.201 --> 01:56:56.421]  Why?
[01:56:57.239 --> 01:56:58.621]  Because that's how we operate.
[01:56:58.661 --> 01:57:00.504]  No, that's how you operate, Alex.
[01:57:00.564 --> 01:57:01.946]  You have every right to do so.
[01:57:02.387 --> 01:57:03.849]  Some people operate in different ways.
[01:57:03.869 --> 01:57:12.602]  But you're talking now, hey David, David, David, you're talking like O'Brien now, in 1984, when he tells Winston he can float off the ground like a soap bubble.
[01:57:13.770 --> 01:57:17.572]  Well, let me put it this way, Alex.
[01:57:17.592 --> 01:57:20.353]  You're now looking at, you're in a studio, you're looking at a wall.
[01:57:21.313 --> 01:57:22.514]  That wall looks solid to you.
[01:57:22.594 --> 01:57:23.034]  It can't be.
[01:57:23.094 --> 01:57:27.456]  It's made of atoms, and atoms are as least solid that you could ever come across.
[01:57:27.536 --> 01:57:35.199]  I mean, as one physicist said, if you take the atom to be the size of a cathedral, then the particles within it are about the size of... David, we've got a break.
[01:57:35.259 --> 01:57:35.959]  We've got a break.
[01:57:36.180 --> 01:57:41.802]  But if I, look, but at my level of reality, of my manifested reality, it is solid.
[01:57:43.769 --> 01:57:44.350]  Hello, folk!
[01:57:50.395 --> 01:57:51.056]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.716 --> 01:57:52.797]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.478 --> 01:57:54.639]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.239 --> 01:57:56.060]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.801 --> 01:57:57.742]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.762 --> 01:58:02.005]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.566 --> 01:58:06.630]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.737 --> 01:58:10.478]  Alright folks, already into hour number three.
[01:58:10.498 --> 01:58:12.119]  We've got David Icke on with us.
[01:58:12.139 --> 01:58:13.840]  DavidIcke.com is the website.
[01:58:15.661 --> 01:58:20.823]  And of course my website is at PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:20.863 --> 01:58:22.664]  And all these callers we're going to get to you.
[01:58:24.065 --> 01:58:27.026]  Who knows if David Icke wants to talk about electronic voting machine fraud.
[01:58:27.046 --> 01:58:28.487]  Well, Bev Harris would keep him on for that.
[01:58:28.827 --> 01:58:32.389]  It's always interesting to have him on and he's a very intelligent person.
[01:58:32.669 --> 01:58:35.050]  I think what's important is he gets us all to think.
[01:58:36.088 --> 01:58:48.677]  And shifting out of just not thinking, and watching television, and drinking a six-pack of beer, and going to church, and hearing how good George Bush is, or going to the Democratic meeting and hearing how good John Kerry is.
[01:58:48.697 --> 01:58:58.003]  I mean, I agree with him about Skull and Bones, and about 9-11, and about Bohemian Grove, and a lot of what David says I check out and it turns out to be true, and he obviously uses some of my research.
[01:58:58.907 --> 01:59:07.374]  But we do get focused in on the, I'd say, 5% of what David said that a lot of our listeners vehemently disagree with, and I do as well.
[01:59:08.280 --> 01:59:14.784]  Of course, the nature of matter is that there's giant spaces in it.
[01:59:14.824 --> 01:59:19.326]  And David says, well, there's that wall in front of you in the studio, and it's not really there.
[01:59:19.386 --> 01:59:36.356]  But at my level of physical manifestation, molecular level, on the dimensional spectrum, if you want to get into quantum mechanics, that my structure, my atom structure, is similar to that of the wall, and that is a wall that's there for me.
[01:59:36.956 --> 01:59:46.919]  So, you know, just throwing out some comments about quantum mechanics, you know, sounds very authoritative, but I mean, what does it mean?
[01:59:46.979 --> 01:59:51.120]  I could, you know, just say, well, I'll tell you what my arguments sound, because ham sandwich!
[01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:57.342]  We're about to go to your calls, I'm not trying to be mean, David, I'm trying to, some of the things you're saying, again,
[01:59:58.102 --> 02:00:15.353]  I only have my limited spectrum of consciousness, and I am able to wake people up off of facts and real things in this plane of existence, and then you go off into this other plane of existence where you can't demonstrate it for me, and demonstrating things is the basis of science.
[02:00:15.374 --> 02:00:15.754]  Go ahead.
[02:00:16.774 --> 02:00:18.816]  Well, I don't care if you are being mean, Alex.
[02:00:19.036 --> 02:00:19.836]  It doesn't matter to me.
[02:00:19.856 --> 02:00:21.257]  I'd be out of your life, you know?
[02:00:21.277 --> 02:00:22.038]  I'm just giving you a...
[02:00:22.597 --> 02:00:25.320]  Well, I think, and take it or leave it.
[02:00:25.340 --> 02:00:26.140]  It doesn't matter to me.
[02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:26.841]  Think something else.
[02:00:27.201 --> 02:00:31.205]  But, you know, you say you can't prove it.
[02:00:31.245 --> 02:00:36.230]  Well, the wall is made of atoms, and atoms are freaking empty.
[02:00:36.630 --> 02:00:45.278]  Now, what you're doing is constructing, and I'm doing the same with this wall in front of me now, is we're constructing a reality in our minds, a collective reality.
[02:00:47.637 --> 02:00:54.679]  As quantum physics has also said, atoms or particles within the atoms, they take two forms.
[02:00:54.739 --> 02:01:02.241]  They take a waveform, which is non-physical, and they take a particle form, which appears to our minds to be physical.
[02:01:02.601 --> 02:01:09.403]  And the only time that the waveform becomes a particle is when we're looking at it, when we're observing it.
[02:01:09.703 --> 02:01:13.324]  So what I'm saying is, you said something very correct earlier about what I'm trying to do.
[02:01:13.988 --> 02:01:15.529]  I'm not trying to get people to believe anything.
[02:01:15.609 --> 02:01:20.712]  I don't care what people believe, as long as it's what they believe and not what someone else has imposed externally upon them to believe.
[02:01:21.512 --> 02:01:25.255]  I'm trying to get people to see that there are other possibilities.
[02:01:25.775 --> 02:01:37.622]  Once people realise that, the possibility that's being sold to them from cradle to grave through the education system, he said laughing, through the media and
[02:01:38.340 --> 02:01:40.221]  We've got a break again.
[02:01:40.301 --> 02:01:41.881]  Long segment coming up.
[02:01:41.981 --> 02:01:44.842]  We'll have time to get to calls, folks.
[02:02:07.049 --> 02:02:25.073]  But I will say this, it's like I don't agree with everything you're saying, I don't agree with everything that Michael Moore is saying, but his film is really helping us, I know he's helping me, because he's opening people's eyes, at least to the fact that they're being lied to, now as they dig deeper they'll see a bigger part of the picture.
[02:02:26.414 --> 02:02:30.938]  So, we'll be back with David Icke and we'll go to Mike and Rick and Tim and Anthony and Sean and others.
[02:02:31.018 --> 02:02:32.039]  Everybody, stay there!
[02:02:32.059 --> 02:02:37.223]  Go to your calls quickly on the other side, then I'll get into some news articles and get David Icke's take on that.
[02:02:37.243 --> 02:02:37.924]  You don't want to miss it.
[02:02:37.944 --> 02:02:40.326]  Stay with us.
[02:02:44.910 --> 02:02:49.254]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:49.434 --> 02:02:53.798]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:56.013 --> 02:02:58.396]  Use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:02:58.476 --> 02:03:01.319]  A New World Order can emerge.
[02:03:01.559 --> 02:03:05.764]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:05.844 --> 02:03:12.771]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:12.892 --> 02:03:14.914]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:15.134 --> 02:03:25.599]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:25.879 --> 02:03:31.262]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:03:31.762 --> 02:03:34.403]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:03:34.423 --> 02:03:34.984]  Recall toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:03:35.024 --> 02:03:35.504]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:35.524 --> 02:03:36.825]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:03:44.614 --> 02:03:46.235]  Skyrocketing oil prices.
[02:03:46.315 --> 02:03:47.495]  The economy on the brink.
[02:03:47.635 --> 02:03:48.596]  A plunging dollar.
[02:03:48.696 --> 02:03:49.396]  Terrorism.
[02:03:49.516 --> 02:03:52.517]  The government spending $1.80 for every dollar it collects.
[02:03:52.837 --> 02:03:58.120]  Never in the history of our country have we faced so many threats to our freedoms, rights, and individual security.
[02:03:58.300 --> 02:04:00.881]  How long can we continue without a fracture occurring?
[02:04:01.021 --> 02:04:06.063]  With the events that recently rocked the elections in Spain, what will happen as we get closer to our own election?
[02:04:06.643 --> 02:04:09.124]  Now is the time to begin preparing for such threats.
[02:04:09.404 --> 02:04:14.166]  Ready Reserve Foods has been helping businesses, government, and individuals for over 32 years.
[02:04:14.427 --> 02:04:24.271]  No matter what your preparation needs, Ready Reserve Foods offers virtually the finest in dehydrated, nitrogen-packed, long-term storable foods and has food units to fit your particular needs.

[02:04:31.238 --> 02:04:31.779]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[02:04:31.859 --> 02:04:33.080]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:04:44.346 --> 02:04:46.627]  My family's breathing easier, and now you can too!
[02:04:46.827 --> 02:04:50.168]  Hey folks, Michael Trudell here to tell you about the Biozone Air Purifier.
[02:04:50.269 --> 02:04:52.489]  The Biozone Air Purifier is not a filter system.
[02:04:52.650 --> 02:04:58.612]  It works at the molecular level, binding the small bits of dust, allergens, and other particles in your air into clumps that are too heavy to float.
[02:04:58.832 --> 02:05:01.393]  They fall harmlessly to the floor to be literally swept away.
[02:05:01.653 --> 02:05:02.334]  Nothing escapes!
[02:05:02.434 --> 02:05:06.675]  The Biozone Air Purifier also kills virus and bacteria germs and totally removes odors.
[02:05:06.835 --> 02:05:10.477]  Out on the farm we have several cats and two big dogs, so pet odors can be a concern.
[02:05:10.577 --> 02:05:12.818]  But like the odors from anything else, simply gone.
[02:05:13.078 --> 02:05:13.358]  Smoke?
[02:05:13.598 --> 02:05:15.480]  My wife and I don't, but several of our friends do.
[02:05:15.660 --> 02:05:18.722]  Our BioZone Air Purifier clears out that smoke literally within minutes.

[02:05:46.522 --> 02:05:52.148]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:54.049 --> 02:05:56.212]  I'll tell you what's concrete, my friends.
[02:05:56.612 --> 02:06:02.078]  The government is running a scam with your votes, with the elections, and Bev Harris will be joining us here in about
[02:06:02.685 --> 02:06:02.905]  25 minutes.
[02:06:02.925 --> 02:06:06.128]  We're going to take a bunch of calls for David Icke.
[02:06:06.749 --> 02:06:10.512]  But David, just going back into what we started the interview with, something we agree on.
[02:06:10.532 --> 02:06:12.554]  Yeah, seems a long time ago.
[02:06:12.594 --> 02:06:14.516]  We've been a few places since, Alex, haven't we?
[02:06:14.816 --> 02:06:16.378]  We have, but U.S.
[02:06:16.598 --> 02:06:21.022]  mulling how to delay or cancel November vote in case of attack.
[02:06:21.042 --> 02:06:22.143]  We've got Ridge in front of
[02:06:22.903 --> 02:06:30.285]  Camera feeds, oh big brother, it'll keep you safe, saying, you know, we may have to suspend the election, martial law might be needed.
[02:06:30.665 --> 02:06:32.426]  This is openly being discussed.
[02:06:32.486 --> 02:06:37.627]  I mean, how much more in your face, folks, does it need to get?
[02:06:38.027 --> 02:06:42.149]  Then you look at the evidence of who's behind Al Qaeda and who's behind 9-11.
[02:06:42.209 --> 02:06:47.150]  That is totally provable, not debatable.
[02:06:49.231 --> 02:06:50.651]  Where do you see this going, David?
[02:06:51.744 --> 02:06:59.226]  Well, obviously, 9-11, like Oklahoma, as I think you mentioned earlier, is not it.
[02:06:59.406 --> 02:07:00.887]  It's the stage on the road to it.
[02:07:01.387 --> 02:07:11.870]  And there are more stages on that road to come, because they have a time scale which is not a million years from now, and they have to push this on if they're going to get it into place.
[02:07:12.390 --> 02:07:19.595]  One of the key things they need to get into place, and is in so many ways the jewel in their crown, is the microchip.
[02:07:19.675 --> 02:07:25.739]  And I understand that it's been a few weeks in America, they now have chipmobiles going around chipping people.
[02:07:26.080 --> 02:07:27.921]  Yeah, that's the A.P.
[02:07:27.941 --> 02:07:33.965]  They have chipmobiles, and they're going to sell it as a fad to the young people, rebel against your parents, get it?
[02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:40.481]  David, they are now moving to put it in special forces.
[02:07:40.881 --> 02:07:45.262]  They're now all over the children's publications and TV shows promoting it.
[02:07:45.382 --> 02:07:47.002]  Why do they want that chip so bad?
[02:07:47.502 --> 02:08:02.684]  Well, interestingly, back in 1997, I was asked through a third party to meet a guy who was a scientist with the CIA, who joined the CIA genuinely thinking he was serving his country in his early twenties.
[02:08:02.724 --> 02:08:05.605]  He was a genius in the area of magnetics and various other
[02:08:06.164 --> 02:08:16.511]  Cutting edge technology and he asked to meet me to try to get out what was going on because he couldn't for reasons that became very rapidly clear.
[02:08:17.432 --> 02:08:30.241]  He was telling me that when he rebelled against what he realized he was being asked to do, which was to use his genius to advance his agenda, which he very soon realized existed.
[02:08:30.908 --> 02:08:32.430]  I don't know.
[02:08:53.004 --> 02:08:58.651]  I can only describe it as a see-through plastic shampoo sachet with an orangey-golden liquid in it.
[02:08:59.171 --> 02:09:02.375]  And apparently he was saying in the CIA they call these patches.
[02:09:03.056 --> 02:09:08.142]  And what they do is manipulate people like him who are rebelling.
[02:09:08.702 --> 02:09:16.829]  Scientists whose knowledge and ability they need to have their bodies to need the drug in the patch to survive.
[02:09:16.969 --> 02:09:21.633]  And if the body doesn't get this drug then they start to die and it's a long and painful death.
[02:09:21.653 --> 02:09:28.038]  Well that's actually an old program used hundreds of years ago where they put a poison into you where only they know the secret antidote.
[02:09:28.058 --> 02:09:29.599]  You've got to serve them or you die.
[02:09:29.740 --> 02:09:31.061]  That's actually confirmed.
[02:09:31.381 --> 02:09:32.462]  Right, exactly.
[02:09:32.502 --> 02:09:36.205]  And it's amazing Alex when you do look at ancient history just how many
[02:09:36.765 --> 02:09:37.826]  I think so, yes.
[02:10:02.871 --> 02:10:06.213]  Well, let me stop you right there, David, because we have...
[02:10:28.667 --> 02:10:29.027]  Go ahead.
[02:10:29.508 --> 02:10:44.462]  Yeah, he said that even in 1997, and we've seen some evidence of that since, he said outside the public arena, microchips are so small they can be inserted in a hypodermic needle during vaccination programs.
[02:10:45.062 --> 02:10:50.447]  And he said even people who become aware of the microchip don't realize the full magnitude of it.
[02:10:50.527 --> 02:10:54.411]  It's not just an electronic tag, although that's definitely one level of it.
[02:10:54.751 --> 02:11:04.015]  He said, to me again, 1997, it's not the messages going from the chip to the computer that are the prime reason for it, though it's one.
[02:11:04.415 --> 02:11:06.435]  It's the messages coming the other way.
[02:11:06.856 --> 02:11:18.580]  He said that they can isolate the microchip, take someone out physically through it, they can manipulate individuals, or do en masse manipulations of... Let me stop you.
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:19.280]  Let me stop you.
[02:11:19.300 --> 02:11:22.802]  In my film, Road to Tyranny, I have a CBS News clip from 2000 where they say,
[02:11:24.242 --> 02:11:34.151]  They're going to do this and now they have the system if you're depressed, this is the Associated Press, they put a wire into the brain to make you feel better, David.
[02:11:34.511 --> 02:11:37.354]  Once we have the wire, we won't be so crazy anymore.
[02:11:37.374 --> 02:11:40.877]  So they're openly now, so all this stuff that we talked about years ago,
[02:11:41.477 --> 02:11:41.998]  We're good to go.
[02:11:59.778 --> 02:12:02.641]  The other thing the scientists said, by the way, was that they would use
[02:12:17.697 --> 02:12:24.741]  The excuse of replacing credit cards and credit card fraud with microchips holding your financial details.
[02:12:25.322 --> 02:12:37.209]  And just a few months ago, I'm sure you know, this company, which used to be what's like a hawk, Applied Digital Solutions, came out and said that they wanted to replace credit cards with their microchips.
[02:12:37.249 --> 02:12:42.532]  So like we've said throughout this chat, Alex, what has been predicted is now in our face.
[02:12:42.552 --> 02:12:43.332]  It's now happening.
[02:12:43.372 --> 02:12:44.193]  It's not in the future.
[02:12:44.233 --> 02:12:44.513]  It's here.
[02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:46.480]  Well, absolutely.
[02:12:48.621 --> 02:12:49.382]  It's here, folks.
[02:12:49.542 --> 02:12:50.502]  Mike in Arizona.
[02:12:50.562 --> 02:12:51.403]  Mike, you're on the air.
[02:12:51.463 --> 02:12:51.823]  Go ahead.
[02:12:51.863 --> 02:12:52.463]  Thanks for holding.
[02:12:52.683 --> 02:12:53.604]  Yeah, thanks, Alec.
[02:12:55.144 --> 02:13:00.767]  Does Mr. Ike have any speaking engagement in Arizona or anywhere out in the West?
[02:13:02.536 --> 02:13:09.358]  I spoke in Los Angeles two weeks ago, but nothing in that area since.
[02:13:10.478 --> 02:13:11.799]  I'm open to any offers.
[02:13:13.219 --> 02:13:16.280]  My other question is, I'm new to your literature.
[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:19.161]  You speak of reptiles.
[02:13:20.721 --> 02:13:24.182]  Is that some kind of metaphor or code?
[02:13:24.242 --> 02:13:26.943]  If so, you don't need to elaborate.
[02:13:27.003 --> 02:13:27.963]  I think I understand.
[02:13:28.821 --> 02:13:34.082]  But if it's not, if you're talking about these in a literal sense, I'd like you to elaborate.
[02:13:34.583 --> 02:13:35.763]  Well, two things to that.
[02:13:35.823 --> 02:13:39.324]  First of all, in a literal sense, yes.
[02:13:39.924 --> 02:13:41.064]  Not as a metaphor.
[02:13:42.945 --> 02:13:51.847]  And when you're talking about something that is so way out, so fantastic, even to people who are opening their minds to
[02:13:52.595 --> 02:13:52.835]  I've got
[02:14:11.195 --> 02:14:11.736]  I think so.
[02:14:24.938 --> 02:14:28.219]  Then, um, you know, have you heard of the law of gravity and all this stuff?
[02:14:28.299 --> 02:14:38.821]  It sounded ludicrous to people at that time who didn't know about the laws of gravity, so... Well, I mean, I'll put it in a nutshell and tell me if you think I'm wrong, and again, I don't go there, I don't go into flying saucers, I don't go into stuff I can't prove.
[02:14:38.901 --> 02:14:52.203]  I stick to, it's hard enough that they're on the news saying every child needs a microchip, but basically, there's these interdimensional rulers of our planet that run the Illuminati as their servants, and that's basically what you're saying, Mr. Reich?
[02:14:52.743 --> 02:15:05.731]  Yeah, I'm saying that this age-old term or concept, which is very much still there today... The serpent in the garden!
[02:15:06.151 --> 02:15:18.779]  ...of possession, people being possessed by other dimensional entities which take over their mental and emotional processes, is what is ultimately behind the Illuminati, and that these
[02:15:19.409 --> 02:15:19.970]  I don't think so.
[02:15:34.784 --> 02:15:36.125]  But then you get into the Bible.
[02:15:36.265 --> 02:15:39.346]  It says that these people served the devil, the children of the devil.
[02:15:40.487 --> 02:15:44.129]  Real quick though, I don't even get into that because I can't prove it.
[02:15:44.709 --> 02:15:48.291]  I believe the Bible, I just don't get into it because it's so amazing.
[02:15:48.791 --> 02:15:49.532]  Mike, anything else?
[02:15:50.192 --> 02:16:00.620]  Well, it just strikes me as rather curious that he doesn't believe in Jesus, who's, I think, pretty well documented, but he does believe in reptiles, who most of us haven't had any experience with.
[02:16:01.041 --> 02:16:01.381]  All right.
[02:16:01.401 --> 02:16:02.802]  Well, believe something else then, mate.
[02:16:03.062 --> 02:16:04.483]  That's real simple.
[02:16:04.523 --> 02:16:12.830]  Look at the evidence on both sides of some argument, and really look at the evidence rather than just say, yes, everyone knows that.
[02:16:13.210 --> 02:16:14.531]  It's a mistake that a lot of people make.
[02:16:15.993 --> 02:16:22.217]  Because everyone knows, actually very little, I've got something like 90 odd percent of what people believe is actually in the end not true.
[02:16:22.237 --> 02:16:24.238]  Well, David, David, you know what people say.
[02:16:24.258 --> 02:16:33.784]  David, David, David, David, David, David, David, David, you know what people say about you, though.
[02:16:34.104 --> 02:16:44.891]  They say that you bring out all this stuff that's documented, that I can prove, and then you add stuff like the reptiles, the reptoid rulers, onto it, then psychologically discrediting all the real stuff.
[02:16:46.581 --> 02:16:48.702]  Well, they'll just have to believe that.
[02:16:48.942 --> 02:16:51.744]  I'm interested in what is happening in the world.
[02:16:51.764 --> 02:17:03.730]  I am not limited by a belief system and I'm not limited by caring what other people think about me and worrying about whether people will ridicule what I say.
[02:17:04.210 --> 02:17:05.971]  I'm just interested in what's going on.
[02:17:06.031 --> 02:17:07.372]  Well, I'm interested, David.
[02:17:07.652 --> 02:17:08.812]  Make of it what you will.
[02:17:09.032 --> 02:17:10.833]  What you make of it is up to you.
[02:17:10.893 --> 02:17:11.914]  Yeah, I'm interested, sir.
[02:17:12.114 --> 02:17:14.015]  What people think of me is none of my business.
[02:17:14.455 --> 02:17:20.858]  I'm interested in scientifically proving the things I say, which I can do, and then convincing rational people.
[02:17:21.178 --> 02:17:29.823]  And I'm saying with some of the stuff you add to this ice cream sundae you've built that I'm saying is real and based on reality, you put the cherry on top.
[02:17:31.103 --> 02:17:33.665]  And I don't agree with the cherry you put on top.
[02:17:33.685 --> 02:17:34.725]  Tell you what, stay there.
[02:17:35.545 --> 02:17:37.947]  We got a break, we'll come back, jam a few more calls in here.
[02:17:38.567 --> 02:17:40.628]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website, folks.

[02:20:41.999 --> 02:20:47.184]  The sun is getting brighter and the days are getting longer.
[02:20:47.384 --> 02:20:48.725]  Summer's just around the corner.
[02:20:48.925 --> 02:20:50.146]  What are your plans for it?
[02:20:50.466 --> 02:20:50.847]  Fishing?
[02:20:51.127 --> 02:20:51.567]  Gardening?
[02:20:51.627 --> 02:20:52.048]  Camping?
[02:20:52.248 --> 02:20:54.390]  I'm sure you'll spend more time enjoying the outdoors.
[02:20:54.610 --> 02:20:57.792]  And I'm sure the ticks and mosquitoes will spend more time enjoying you.
[02:20:58.013 --> 02:21:00.394]  It's not just itching and scratching we have to worry about.
[02:21:00.655 --> 02:21:04.017]  Now there's incurable illnesses like Lyme disease and the West Nile virus.
[02:21:04.378 --> 02:21:06.199]  DEET is proven to keep the bugs away.
[02:21:06.419 --> 02:21:09.502]  But it's also proven to cause brain damage in laboratory animals.
[02:21:09.822 --> 02:21:12.303]  That's not a choice I want to make, and I don't have to.

[02:21:36.395 --> 02:21:37.435]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:37.455 --> 02:21:38.796]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:21:38.816 --> 02:21:41.837]  Alright, a news blitz with some top info coming up in the next segment.
[02:22:01.181 --> 02:22:04.865]  We're going to keep David a little bit in the next segment to finish up with the callers we've got on hold.
[02:22:06.146 --> 02:22:11.471]  But quickly, callers, I have your question, your comment, and David, try to keep the answers short if you can to get to everybody.
[02:22:12.252 --> 02:22:14.093]  Brooke in Rhode Island, you're on the air.
[02:22:14.153 --> 02:22:14.654]  Go ahead.
[02:22:15.154 --> 02:22:15.695]  Yes, Alex.
[02:22:15.795 --> 02:22:16.395]  Thanks a lot.
[02:22:16.415 --> 02:22:17.957]  It's great to speak to David.
[02:22:18.738 --> 02:22:24.183]  In defense of David, I have a comment to make on the flack he's been taking about reptilians
[02:22:25.571 --> 02:22:39.482]  I don't know if you're aware of the fact that the American Medical Association and the New England Journal of Medicine, or School of Medicine, throughout the 90s has said that one part of the human brain is reptilian.
[02:22:39.902 --> 02:22:41.904]  Well, no, I had... Let me finish.
[02:22:43.104 --> 02:22:52.191]  Sir, look, that's just science that the, you know, really three brains and the one down that's attached to your spinal cord is a crocodile brain.
[02:22:52.231 --> 02:22:54.573]  It's almost identical and has the same makeup.
[02:22:55.034 --> 02:23:01.621]  Well, who's to say that the bloodlines, the aristocratic bloodlines, don't have more reptilian DNA in them?
[02:23:02.041 --> 02:23:11.390]  And also, my last thing is, are you aware of the fact that David Rockefeller and Gianni Agnelli and Umberto Agnelli have died in the past year?
[02:23:11.751 --> 02:23:12.872]  Rockefeller last night.
[02:23:13.813 --> 02:23:14.393]  You're kidding!
[02:23:14.453 --> 02:23:16.415]  David Rockefeller died last night?
[02:23:16.535 --> 02:23:16.956]  That's right.
[02:23:17.586 --> 02:23:18.747]  David, have you heard that?
[02:23:18.907 --> 02:23:19.467]  No, I haven't.
[02:23:19.647 --> 02:23:21.128]  It's news to me.
[02:23:21.248 --> 02:23:23.250]  That is ultra-massive.
[02:23:23.310 --> 02:23:24.110]  Yeah, massive.
[02:23:24.150 --> 02:23:38.500]  I was trying to get through to you for an hour to let you know that, because Agnelli, both of them, the brother died at 62, that's Umberto, and then Gianni Agnelli died at 67 last year, and these are all major Illuminati guys.
[02:23:38.580 --> 02:23:40.101]  Rockefeller died last night at 94.
[02:23:42.462 --> 02:23:43.583]  Well, I don't even know.
[02:23:43.603 --> 02:23:46.805]  I mean, a lot of the evidence I've seen is that they staged their deaths.
[02:23:47.763 --> 02:23:55.027]  Because they obviously can't come walking out looking much younger because of all the advanced technologies that they have.
[02:23:55.087 --> 02:23:56.527]  No, no, I know those technologies.
[02:23:56.907 --> 02:23:57.608]  That's real.
[02:23:57.668 --> 02:23:59.008]  We can demonstrate that, David.
[02:23:59.028 --> 02:24:00.629]  Maybe there's a little reptilian in there.
[02:24:01.069 --> 02:24:03.531]  Okay, well maybe there's an Easter Bunny, too.
[02:24:03.671 --> 02:24:05.592]  I have no problem with that technology at all.
[02:24:05.612 --> 02:24:16.797]  Because once you have an advanced knowledge of how things work, what seems impossible to the population and ludicrous and ridiculous suddenly becomes perfectly possible.
[02:24:18.459 --> 02:24:20.761]  Okay, thanks for the call, Brickle.
[02:24:20.821 --> 02:24:22.802]  I know they've got life extension technologies.
[02:24:22.822 --> 02:24:25.344]  I know the technology we see is at least 30 years old.
[02:24:25.384 --> 02:24:26.204]  I mean, that's admitted.
[02:24:26.224 --> 02:24:30.007]  I'll tell you what's interesting is very quickly on that question, though, Alex.
[02:24:30.127 --> 02:24:42.435]  When you look, and this is mainstream science, when you look at the character traits that we supposedly get from the reptilian brain, which is the oldest part of the brain, they are the Illuminati to a T.
[02:24:43.528 --> 02:24:44.650]  I don't think so.
[02:25:03.661 --> 02:25:10.945]  Whatever you believe or don't believe about the reptilian aspect to this, the reptilian brain contains the character traits of the Illuminati.
[02:25:11.365 --> 02:25:14.607]  Well, it is just science that we've got that part of our brain.
[02:25:15.067 --> 02:25:19.510]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rick in Colorado.
[02:25:19.590 --> 02:25:20.930]  Rick, you're on the air with David Icke.
[02:25:20.950 --> 02:25:21.471]  Go ahead.
[02:25:21.491 --> 02:25:22.651]  Hi, guys.
[02:25:22.771 --> 02:25:28.875]  I'd like to commend both of y'all for your fight against this infrastructure that exists today, pretty much.
[02:25:29.495 --> 02:25:31.396]  I'm a first-time caller, so I'm a little bit nervous.
[02:25:31.816 --> 02:25:32.537]  Well, welcome, sir.
[02:25:32.577 --> 02:25:32.917]  Go ahead.
[02:25:33.464 --> 02:25:44.027]  But I do want to say that I agree with David on the fact that religion has divided the people in this country.
[02:25:44.568 --> 02:25:55.011]  And I would like for him to expound a little bit more on the fact that various Jesus figures have appeared throughout history, pretty much throughout the many religions.
[02:25:55.640 --> 02:25:58.524]  That's what the New Age says, but I've looked at it.
[02:25:58.544 --> 02:26:00.987]  There's a big difference between Jesus Christ and Buddha.
[02:26:01.007 --> 02:26:02.929]  Thanks for the call, David.
[02:26:02.989 --> 02:26:15.264]  There's a big difference between Jesus Christ and Buddha, but when you look at entities that worshipped pre-Christianity, like Mithra, like Tamils, etc., and others,
[02:26:15.946 --> 02:26:18.088]  There's tremendous similarities.
[02:26:18.168 --> 02:26:21.831]  In fact, ludicrously similar concepts.
[02:26:22.171 --> 02:26:35.542]  And the reason, for instance, that we have Jesus being given the birthday of December the 25th, and many of these other pre-Christian entities also, is because they relate to the sun, the worship of the sun.
[02:26:35.562 --> 02:26:39.606]  Well now, all of that is true, but they say the occult came in and changed those dates.
[02:26:39.926 --> 02:26:41.007]  Let's take a call.
[02:26:41.187 --> 02:26:42.748]  Let's talk to Tim in Ohio.
[02:26:42.788 --> 02:26:43.389]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:26:44.076 --> 02:26:44.796]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:26:45.137 --> 02:26:45.457]  Hello.
[02:26:45.477 --> 02:26:46.117]  Hello, David.
[02:26:46.177 --> 02:26:48.219]  It's really a pleasure to speak with you.
[02:26:48.239 --> 02:26:50.900]  I've been following your work since like 1999.
[02:26:50.960 --> 02:26:52.161]  I've read your last four books.
[02:26:52.982 --> 02:26:56.424]  The work that you and Alex do has totally consumed and changed my life.
[02:26:56.966 --> 02:27:07.248]  I've started my own organization called Truth, teaching and researching United States treasonous hierarchy, and at the risk of sounding like Cousin Eddie in The Vegas Vacation, I'd take a bullet for either one of you guys.
[02:27:08.008 --> 02:27:16.170]  I'll tell you what, Tim, that's exactly what we need, is for people to pick the baton up and run with it.
[02:27:16.230 --> 02:27:19.531]  Because there isn't one baton here, there's as many as we want to create.
[02:27:21.935 --> 02:27:24.138]  Ask the question, what can Licker Me do?
[02:27:24.198 --> 02:27:26.761]  Well, we can do whatever we choose to do.
[02:27:27.401 --> 02:27:31.206]  We can make a difference, or we can sit down, making excuses why we can't.
[02:27:31.226 --> 02:27:31.806]  We got a break.
[02:27:31.966 --> 02:27:32.467]  Got a break.
[02:27:32.487 --> 02:27:33.188]  We'll come right back.
[02:27:33.208 --> 02:27:34.129]  Take a few final calls.
[02:27:35.390 --> 02:27:36.371]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.792 --> 02:27:38.414]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.315 --> 02:27:42.018]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.070 --> 02:27:47.411]  Is your daily commute a grind?
[02:27:47.571 --> 02:27:51.332]  If it wears on your patience, you'll be amazed at how it grinds on your car or truck, too.
[02:27:51.512 --> 02:27:55.214]  Your engine and transmission wear away mile after mile and day after day.
[02:27:55.534 --> 02:27:59.155]  Hundreds of NT Oil Additive customers have reported increased fuel mileage.
[02:27:59.375 --> 02:28:03.817]  Fleets that conduct used oil analysis report up to 30% reduction in wear metals.
[02:28:04.137 --> 02:28:07.939]  NT Oil Additive is a 100% synthetic product made to perform.
[02:28:08.179 --> 02:28:08.879]  It really works!
[02:28:09.139 --> 02:28:15.262]  NT Oil Additive has been proven in many thousands of engines, manual and automatic transmissions, and other driveline components.
[02:28:15.542 --> 02:28:16.642]  Even in two-cycle engines.
[02:28:16.943 --> 02:28:19.483]  NT Oil Additive was developed for industrial uses.
[02:28:19.623 --> 02:28:22.884]  It works in heat exchangers, air compressors, vacuum pumps and air tools.
[02:28:23.084 --> 02:28:28.166]  Gearboxes and hydraulic systems can operate up to 18 degrees cooler with NT Oil Additive.
[02:28:28.326 --> 02:28:29.766]  Diesel engines thrive on it too.
[02:28:29.967 --> 02:28:34.048]  To place your order, call King Oil Company at 800-647-4079.
[02:28:34.908 --> 02:28:36.248]  We accept MasterCard and Visa.
[02:28:36.268 --> 02:28:41.030]  The order department is open from 8 to 5 Eastern Time, Monday through Friday and on Saturday until noon.
[02:28:41.210 --> 02:28:41.470]  That's 800-647-4079.
[02:28:45.603 --> 02:28:48.625]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:28:48.945 --> 02:28:53.869]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:54.129 --> 02:28:58.472]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:28:58.772 --> 02:29:07.698]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:29:07.898 --> 02:29:11.521]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:29:11.801 --> 02:29:16.846]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:29:17.126 --> 02:29:23.872]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:29:24.352 --> 02:29:24.893]  What about you?
[02:29:25.649 --> 02:29:30.992]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:29:47.481 --> 02:29:52.965]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:53.386 --> 02:29:57.629]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:29:57.869 --> 02:30:04.895]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:05.275 --> 02:30:11.380]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:11.520 --> 02:30:12.741]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:13.081 --> 02:30:16.023]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:30:16.183 --> 02:30:18.205]  Eliminate the cost, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:30:18.505 --> 02:30:25.750]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:30:26.050 --> 02:30:29.433]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:30:29.853 --> 02:30:32.954]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[02:30:32.974 --> 02:30:33.014]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:33.034 --> 02:30:33.094]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:33.214 --> 02:30:34.294]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:30:34.314 --> 02:30:34.514]  Call today.
[02:30:57.040 --> 02:31:03.205]  Ideal legislation, documents, human history, what elites have done in the past, what they're setting up today.
[02:31:03.245 --> 02:31:06.707]  The government openly saying they may want to suspend the election.
[02:31:08.008 --> 02:31:09.929]  The giant prisons being built everywhere.
[02:31:10.090 --> 02:31:11.511]  The Federal Reserve being private.
[02:31:11.651 --> 02:31:14.613]  I can prove 100% all of that.
[02:31:14.733 --> 02:31:16.634]  Now, is there a lot of things that have been hidden from us?
[02:31:16.674 --> 02:31:19.997]  A lot of amazing things that show that truth is stranger than fiction?
[02:31:20.537 --> 02:31:21.958]  Undoubtedly, yes, that's the case.
[02:31:22.018 --> 02:31:22.879]  We don't know a lot.
[02:31:23.619 --> 02:31:25.841]  But I do know this New World Order is evil and a fraud.
[02:31:26.477 --> 02:31:34.022]  I would just challenge people to research everything for yourselves and to keep an open mind, but also to not believe everything I say or anybody else says.
[02:31:34.102 --> 02:31:35.003]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:31:35.543 --> 02:31:41.327]  But David Icke is a real force out there in the world, and I agree with him when he says you can be a force in the world.
[02:31:41.867 --> 02:31:42.788]  You can take action.
[02:31:42.868 --> 02:31:43.929]  I know you can do things.
[02:31:44.249 --> 02:31:46.510]  I know you can affect change, whether it's for good or bad.
[02:31:47.511 --> 02:31:56.197]  So let's try to jam a few final calls in here that we're going to have Bev Harris on with something that is totally documented, the stealing of elections, the fraud, the electronic voting machines.
[02:31:57.146 --> 02:32:03.111]  But real quick, and I mean quickly callers, Anthony in Ohio, you're on the air with David Iye, go ahead.
[02:32:03.711 --> 02:32:04.992]  Hi Alex, nice to talk to you.
[02:32:05.012 --> 02:32:06.413]  Nice to talk to you, go ahead.
[02:32:06.693 --> 02:32:08.614]  Hi David, everybody, great to talk to you.
[02:32:08.975 --> 02:32:19.822]  I wanted to talk about abrupt climate change and that Pentagon report that came out in February where they predicted the UK would be like Siberia within 20 years or so.
[02:32:21.181 --> 02:32:29.885]  I wanted to know if... And notice there's a movie out at the very same time, and saying the UN needs to take over, we need to have a world tax to save us.
[02:32:30.325 --> 02:32:32.206]  I mean, yes, does the Earth change?
[02:32:32.326 --> 02:32:32.586]  Yes.
[02:32:32.666 --> 02:32:35.348]  But are they using this for propaganda right now?
[02:32:35.688 --> 02:32:36.008]  Yes.
[02:32:36.028 --> 02:32:39.290]  I mean, first it was global warming, now it's cooling.
[02:32:39.810 --> 02:32:40.510]  Comments, David?
[02:32:43.031 --> 02:32:46.013]  No more to say, really, except that, you know, I agree with you.
[02:32:46.994 --> 02:33:03.807]  Another massive con, in fact there's a famous environmentalist in Britain who's come out very recently, last week or so, who's actually showing that the whole foundation of the theory of global warming,
[02:33:04.815 --> 02:33:08.618]  The so-called greenhouse gases is impossible.
[02:33:08.658 --> 02:33:15.424]  But the problem is the globalists can manipulate the weather themselves and create spot crises and then go, oh, give up your rights.
[02:33:15.744 --> 02:33:17.025]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[02:33:17.045 --> 02:33:18.086]  Thanks for the call, Anthony.
[02:33:18.646 --> 02:33:19.827]  Sean in Colorado.
[02:33:19.868 --> 02:33:20.708]  Sean, you're on the air.
[02:33:20.748 --> 02:33:21.149]  Go ahead.
[02:33:23.050 --> 02:33:25.012]  My question is for David here.
[02:33:26.093 --> 02:33:31.277]  I see in the Bible a lot of it is written, over two-thirds is written on faith and love.
[02:33:32.237 --> 02:33:35.179]  And I do believe that half of Jesus' message is faith.
[02:33:35.239 --> 02:33:40.081]  And if you have the faith of a mustard seed, you can move the mountain with your mind.
[02:33:40.121 --> 02:33:41.142]  You can walk on water.
[02:33:41.882 --> 02:33:45.925]  You can take a fish and a loaf of bread and feed a thousand people.
[02:33:46.005 --> 02:33:47.886]  Now, my question to you is this.
[02:33:47.986 --> 02:33:50.767]  Where does faith come into your picture?
[02:33:52.088 --> 02:33:53.209]  Well, faith is belief.
[02:33:53.909 --> 02:33:55.770]  And belief creates and constructs reality.
[02:33:56.517 --> 02:33:58.598]  I don't know.
[02:34:14.788 --> 02:34:15.389]  I think so.
[02:34:35.341 --> 02:34:36.721]  Okay, got to let that caller go.
[02:34:36.741 --> 02:34:40.102]  We'll get to Bernard and Brad, but I'm sorry not with David.
[02:34:40.462 --> 02:34:41.603]  He's got to go in one minute.
[02:34:41.623 --> 02:34:45.224]  We've got another guest coming on real quick with an update on the electronic voting machines.
[02:34:45.524 --> 02:34:48.025]  But John in Tennessee, last caller for David, go ahead.
[02:34:48.265 --> 02:34:50.145]  I want to apologize for David Icke.
[02:34:50.726 --> 02:34:54.047]  I lived in England for ten years with the Air Force and British Motorsport.
[02:34:54.947 --> 02:35:01.049]  The reason so many Europeans are not religious is because the Illuminati and Jewish Freemasons infiltrated government
[02:35:01.636 --> 02:35:05.418]  He used state religion for taxation and genocide, so that turns people off.
[02:35:06.099 --> 02:35:13.744]  The Church of England was invented by King Henry VIII to legalize divorce so he could cut off his wife's head and he banned the English Bible.
[02:35:14.864 --> 02:35:22.769]  Even the word Christianity is a Jewish invention under penalty of death since Jesus' real name was Yahshua and God's real name is Yahweh.
[02:35:23.610 --> 02:35:26.712]  England was the first Christian nation, not Israel or Italy,
[02:35:27.401 --> 02:35:30.742]  As for New Age science, ESP is just prayer and radio waves.
[02:35:30.982 --> 02:35:35.684]  Atoms can never be destroyed by explosions or time, according to every scientist on Earth.
[02:35:36.364 --> 02:35:45.687]  And so-called Christians, who love George Bush, believe God is so powerless that he can't control time and space, and can't control evolution via genetics and DNA.
[02:35:47.027 --> 02:35:49.388]  So Jewish Communism is an atheist religion.
[02:35:50.140 --> 02:35:52.502]  And that's how the Illuminati divide and conquer.
[02:35:52.562 --> 02:35:54.283]  Okay, John, thanks for the call.
[02:35:54.503 --> 02:35:56.325]  I don't agree that Jews run the New World Order.
[02:35:56.365 --> 02:35:57.445]  I think evil people do.
[02:35:57.726 --> 02:35:58.966]  David Icke, final comments?
[02:36:00.428 --> 02:36:15.058]  Well, I would agree with that in the sense that one of the great defense mechanisms that the Illuminati use against researchers is when you mention the Rothschilds, they scream anti-Semite.
[02:36:15.238 --> 02:36:17.040]  Shabbat, a number of events
[02:36:17.998 --> 02:36:27.304]  Shut down over the years because people have targeted venues and said that I'm going to say it's all a great Jewish plot because I mentioned the Rothschilds.
[02:36:27.865 --> 02:36:34.249]  The Illuminati work through all races and they use them and then they discard them just like they do with individuals.
[02:36:35.090 --> 02:36:37.991]  This is this is beyond Earth races.
[02:36:38.892 --> 02:36:39.933]  This whole story and
[02:36:40.939 --> 02:36:50.961]  Those that blame just the Jews just forget that Jewish people as a whole have been victims of this Illuminati over the centuries and not perpetrators of it.
[02:36:51.621 --> 02:36:57.202]  But are some of the members of the Rothschilds who call themselves Jewish?
[02:36:57.242 --> 02:36:57.422]  Yes.
[02:36:57.442 --> 02:36:59.323]  But that doesn't mean it's a Jewish plot.
[02:36:59.823 --> 02:37:00.203]  All right.
[02:37:00.263 --> 02:37:02.323]  David Icke, a very interesting two hours.
[02:37:02.363 --> 02:37:04.924]  Thanks for coming on and I hope to have you back up sometime.
[02:37:05.144 --> 02:37:05.944]  Take care.
[02:37:07.714 --> 02:37:08.295]  All right, folks.
[02:37:08.315 --> 02:37:08.875]  You wanted it.
[02:37:09.075 --> 02:37:09.876]  Hundreds of emails.
[02:37:09.916 --> 02:37:10.776]  Have David Icahn.
[02:37:10.816 --> 02:37:11.177]  We did it.
[02:37:11.317 --> 02:37:15.260]  I don't agree with some of the things he has to say, obviously, but if it gets you thinking, so be it.
[02:37:15.580 --> 02:37:18.302]  Now joining us from Austin, Texas, we had her on the first 30 minutes.
[02:37:18.322 --> 02:37:21.024]  She'll be on for the rest of the broadcast with us.
[02:37:21.064 --> 02:37:22.245]  Take a few calls here in a moment.
[02:37:22.285 --> 02:37:24.587]  It's Bev Harris, who documents things 100%.
[02:37:24.707 --> 02:37:32.112]  She is the forefront of exposing electronic voting machine fraud, and she's here in Austin, Texas, doing research.
[02:37:32.433 --> 02:37:34.234]  She's on a 14-state tour.
[02:37:34.954 --> 02:37:36.716]  And, Bev, good to have you on with us.
[02:37:37.156 --> 02:37:38.076]  Well, hi there!
[02:37:38.316 --> 02:37:38.656]  Again!
[02:37:41.157 --> 02:37:43.138]  Coming up tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:37:43.178 --> 02:37:47.679]  at the Capitol in the main Rotunda area, you're going to be there.
[02:37:47.699 --> 02:37:54.341]  Do you have any details of how folks can come down to the Capitol for this rally for transparency in voting?
[02:37:55.121 --> 02:37:58.082]  We need as many people there as possible, because remember,
[02:37:59.344 --> 02:38:00.484]  It makes a big difference.
[02:38:00.524 --> 02:38:04.925]  In fact, they're thinking nationwide that Austin may set the pace for the country.
[02:38:04.965 --> 02:38:14.467]  So get down there and show folks that you want to get auditable voting, and you want transparency in the election system.
[02:38:15.927 --> 02:38:17.227]  Absolutely, indeed.
[02:38:17.327 --> 02:38:18.787]  And so that's coming up.
[02:38:18.827 --> 02:38:22.188]  But do you have the details of where exactly it'll be at the Capitol tomorrow?
[02:38:22.208 --> 02:38:23.928]  It's going to be in the Rotunda, I believe.
[02:38:24.368 --> 02:38:26.188]  And it's going to be at 11 o'clock.
[02:38:26.289 --> 02:38:27.589]  And so it'd be better to get there about 1045.
[02:38:27.629 --> 02:38:28.049]  Get ready.
[02:38:29.694 --> 02:38:30.795]  And make a showing.
[02:38:31.755 --> 02:38:37.037]  All right, and then tomorrow night you're going to be at a local community event, and tell folks about that.
[02:38:37.057 --> 02:38:43.160]  Yeah, I've got a fundraiser, and that fundraising is going directly for consumer protection in this next election.
[02:38:43.180 --> 02:38:44.740]  Excuse me, we're going to need it.
[02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:46.861]  It's going to be at the Unitarian Church, I believe.
[02:38:47.522 --> 02:38:57.906]  And that will be from 7 to 10, and I will be producing some, I will be reporting some information that nobody has got yet.
[02:38:58.584 --> 02:39:06.885]  Which is coming from our 14-state tour of some of the things that we have been... What we've been doing is what nobody else has been doing, is going directly into the belly of the beast.
[02:39:07.166 --> 02:39:12.566]  You've been chronicling the federally engineered fraud at the local level, at the point-blank range.
[02:39:13.127 --> 02:39:16.227]  Right, because, you know, an election always takes place at the local level.
[02:39:17.067 --> 02:39:26.669]  Well, it certainly does, Bev, and, you know, I wanted to get you back on, because you asked Mulling how to delay or cancel a member vote in case of attack.
[02:39:27.276 --> 02:39:35.060]  And the same people that helped put in these electronic no record voting machines are the ones now talking about canceling the election.
[02:39:35.100 --> 02:39:36.040]  This is outrageous.
[02:39:36.080 --> 02:39:36.960]  Your comments on that?
[02:39:37.421 --> 02:39:40.882]  It is absolutely outrageous and we have to nip this in the bud.
[02:39:41.322 --> 02:39:54.589]  And let me tell you something, in the event that there was some sort of a problem, the only reason it should ever even be postponed for a day is in specific locations where it's physically impossible to hold an election.
[02:39:54.889 --> 02:39:55.469]  But let me tell you,
[02:39:55.874 --> 02:40:02.198]  What they should be talking about, if they're talking about this at all, is Plan B. Plan B. Get some pencils.
[02:40:02.618 --> 02:40:04.239]  Give the day off to count the votes.
[02:40:04.759 --> 02:40:07.261]  We can roll up our sleeves and do what we can do.
[02:40:07.561 --> 02:40:12.064]  But what are we talking about with cancelling and postponing elections?
[02:40:12.504 --> 02:40:16.206]  But then we can't have a no audit trail.
[02:40:16.246 --> 02:40:17.427]  We've got to have the fraud.
[02:40:17.467 --> 02:40:19.288]  We can't have the old-fashioned paper ballot.
[02:40:19.970 --> 02:40:20.591]  Oh gosh!
[02:40:21.291 --> 02:40:22.272]  Wouldn't that be great?
[02:40:22.552 --> 02:40:26.674]  That doesn't allow centralized fraud of the entire system, Bev.
[02:40:27.175 --> 02:40:30.056]  Well, you know, this is the great thing.
[02:40:30.116 --> 02:40:39.622]  When we start demanding these simple, simple things, it puts the onus on the other folks to justify why they're coming up with these ridiculous ideas.
[02:40:40.203 --> 02:40:40.583]  And they should.
[02:40:40.603 --> 02:40:41.864]  They should have to justify it.
[02:40:41.944 --> 02:40:43.745]  Bev, here's a parallel with
[02:40:45.979 --> 02:40:56.349]  What's happening here, you know, they call no audit trail, caught coast-to-coast, engage in fraud, manipulating votes, they call that freedom and say we're bad to want an audit trail or a record or a receipt.
[02:40:56.949 --> 02:41:05.738]  Meanwhile, they appoint a government, appoint a president, he declares martial law in Iraq, they put the Ba'athists and the Communists into power,
[02:41:06.418 --> 02:41:09.080]  And then they call that a democracy?
[02:41:09.101 --> 02:41:17.808]  I mean, so now puppet governments, uh, cancelled elections, appointed Supreme Court governments, I guess this is freedom!
[02:41:18.068 --> 02:41:20.570]  They're relabeling tyranny as freedom, Bev!
[02:41:22.252 --> 02:41:26.655]  Well, you know, the thing is, yes, we have to just keep, we gotta keep them honest.
[02:41:27.336 --> 02:41:31.579]  I know, don't laugh, you know, but, but to be silent is not the answer.
[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:34.482]  Every single time we hear stuff like,
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.581]  We need to cancel elections to protect democracy.
[02:41:37.801 --> 02:41:39.121]  Absolutely the opposite.
[02:41:39.181 --> 02:41:41.862]  No, we don't cancel up democracy for fear.
[02:41:42.862 --> 02:41:45.583]  You know, our sons and daughters are dying to vote, literally.
[02:41:45.603 --> 02:41:54.265]  And we need to get out there and stop this kind of talk and just, you know, when you hear something like that, just say, nope, not having it and speak up.
[02:41:54.932 --> 02:41:58.255]  Well, Bev, go back to what you brought up earlier.
[02:41:58.275 --> 02:42:10.425]  I mean, the very new federal body created by Bush that oversees the Federal Elections Commission, these are the guys putting in the voting machines, these scam systems, they're the people saying, cancel the election or postpone it.
[02:42:10.925 --> 02:42:12.046]  I'm very concerned about this.
[02:42:12.066 --> 02:42:16.490]  They're also the people who are saying, we don't really think it's a good idea to have election monitors.
[02:42:17.030 --> 02:42:17.831]  What is that?
[02:42:18.331 --> 02:42:19.772]  Give us the names and the mechanism.
[02:42:22.570 --> 02:42:42.422]  Forrest Tessori is the head of it, and I'll tell you some of the same people that put the touchscreen voting machines in, Britton Williams, Paul Craft, Danetta Davidson, these kinds of people, the same people that pushed the unauditable systems down our throat are the ones that got appointed to this new committee.
[02:42:43.024 --> 02:42:45.986]  And what's really strange about that is they created a fiasco.
[02:42:46.006 --> 02:42:46.986]  We all know that.
[02:42:47.086 --> 02:42:52.209]  You know, we've got states that are decertifying it, and counties that are rescinding their contracts.
[02:42:52.750 --> 02:42:55.611]  We've got lawsuits in multiple locations.
[02:42:55.791 --> 02:43:03.856]  Why would you choose people who had put that kind of fiasco in place and put them into a national committee, which is supposed to... Well, it's a damage committee.
[02:43:03.936 --> 02:43:05.116]  It's a damage control.
[02:43:05.217 --> 02:43:08.679]  It's like Bush appointing the 9-11 Commission and calling an independent.
[02:43:09.479 --> 02:43:11.180]  And I'll tell you what else to expect.
[02:43:11.630 --> 02:43:14.079]  Okay, this is something I'm finding out in my research.
[02:43:14.421 --> 02:43:16.187]  There is a company called Vote Here.
[02:43:16.792 --> 02:43:25.577]  Which wants to produce a cryptographic technique where you basically get some sort of a receipt and then get a code number, go compare something with the internet.
[02:43:25.697 --> 02:43:30.540]  And that's an algorithm within the scam or a certification on the machines.
[02:43:30.940 --> 02:43:37.624]  Right, and still you've got a couple of people who you don't know controlling everything and just doing the simple thing, count the ballots.
[02:43:37.704 --> 02:43:38.884]  It's simple, it's simple.
[02:43:38.904 --> 02:43:45.228]  When you come in, you're given a vote number, not even off your name, and then it prints off into a ballot box for recounts.
[02:43:45.848 --> 02:43:46.488]  And you know what?
[02:43:46.568 --> 02:43:47.509]  This is the funny thing.
[02:43:47.569 --> 02:43:57.475]  Why are we spending billions and billions and billions of dollars when if they can't find enough people to count the vote, give the day off then and tell them, okay, we can count the vote this way.
[02:43:57.775 --> 02:44:06.079]  I mean, we're doing amazing things just simply to get away from having evidence of what the vote is and counting it properly in front of many eyes.
[02:44:06.980 --> 02:44:12.223]  And I'm telling you, this is really, um, this Vote Here Company, it's just an inside
[02:44:15.347 --> 02:44:19.430]  I just recently read memos indicating they're putting it into the Diebold system.
[02:44:19.590 --> 02:44:20.330]  I didn't know that.
[02:44:20.511 --> 02:44:24.974]  It's in the Sequoia system.
[02:44:26.655 --> 02:44:32.499]  We've got this company that no one knows anything about putting some sort of cryptography
[02:44:33.132 --> 02:44:34.353]  Inside the voting system.
[02:44:34.493 --> 02:44:37.876]  And then no one's allowed to look at it because, quote, it's proprietary software.
[02:44:38.216 --> 02:44:40.258]  Yeah, and we're the cryptographers who know best.
[02:44:40.318 --> 02:44:42.860]  And if you look at who's on the board of this company, you're right.
[02:44:42.880 --> 02:44:45.842]  I don't mean to sound alarmist, but these are CIA directors.
[02:44:46.222 --> 02:44:48.224]  You know, Robert Gates is on the board.
[02:44:49.004 --> 02:44:54.209]  One of the guys on the Defense Policy Board, Admiral Bill Owens, was the chairman of the board.
[02:44:54.229 --> 02:44:54.449]  Former NSA.
[02:44:54.769 --> 02:44:57.851]  Yeah, and he was former, he was the chairman of the board for many years.
[02:44:58.352 --> 02:45:01.114]  And our, my state is Washington State.
[02:45:02.128 --> 02:45:14.974]  Our Secretary of State stepped down and took a position as Chairman of the Board, and he didn't even wait the one year required, he waited like three days, went over and took that, and now they're pushing this system into our state.
[02:45:16.015 --> 02:45:24.138]  We have to be up to speed on this stuff, and we have to speak up and say, no, I don't want that system, this is what I want, and don't back down.
[02:45:24.399 --> 02:45:29.521]  And I'll tell you the hint, from when they're trying to switch over to these cryptography things,
[02:45:30.382 --> 02:45:31.503]  Ballot versus trail.
[02:45:31.783 --> 02:45:34.745]  If they're talking about a paper ballot, that's what we want.
[02:45:34.765 --> 02:45:41.449]  If they're talking about a paper trail, they're generally planning to switch over into this cryptography stuff at a later date.
[02:45:42.010 --> 02:45:42.430]  Alright, Bev.
[02:45:42.490 --> 02:45:43.411]  Because it's a trail.
[02:45:44.531 --> 02:45:57.780]  Bev Harris, I know you're busy, I'm going to let you go, but I know tomorrow you're going to be bringing out some instances of how they're paying the people off locally to go along with this with the thousands of county clerks
[02:45:59.102 --> 02:46:06.466]  And I want to get you up for an hour later this week, after you've gotten out of town, to go over this with us.
[02:46:06.727 --> 02:46:14.451]  But tomorrow, 1045, inside the Capitol, folks, just ask the state police, hey, where's the people about the voting machines?
[02:46:14.831 --> 02:46:16.952]  And they'll direct you into the rotunda.
[02:46:17.372 --> 02:46:22.996]  And then tomorrow night, 7 o'clock, and Bev, the website's blackboxvoting.org.
[02:46:23.176 --> 02:46:24.596]  Thank you so much for coming on.
[02:46:24.616 --> 02:46:25.417]  Thank you.
[02:46:26.147 --> 02:46:26.427]  You bet.
[02:46:26.447 --> 02:46:26.987]  You're awesome.
[02:46:27.027 --> 02:46:27.408]  Take care.
[02:46:27.448 --> 02:46:32.690]  I just really wanted to promote that today, so I had her on the first 30 minutes and then had her back on for a few minutes now.
[02:46:33.791 --> 02:46:42.856]  Boy, this broadcast has just blasted past us, but I'm going to come back and take a few final calls from folks that have been holding the longest, but look at this New York Times article.
[02:46:43.396 --> 02:46:45.997]  A secret conference thought to rule the world.
[02:46:46.938 --> 02:46:53.341]  Another new New York Times article saying, yeah, they basically appointed John Edwards at the Bilderberg Group meeting.
[02:46:55.041 --> 02:47:01.886]  And our comment is, you know it's coming down to the wire when the New York Times talks about Bilderberg and world government.
[02:47:02.026 --> 02:47:05.228]  Externalization of the hierarchy has never been more apparent.
[02:47:05.268 --> 02:47:09.391]  That's on PrisonPlanet.com and TV and InfoWars right now.
[02:47:09.951 --> 02:47:13.053]  Arafat says Israel masterminded Tel Aviv bombing.
[02:47:13.073 --> 02:47:24.621]  Jerusalem Post, Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, condemns Sunday's Tel Aviv bombing explosion that was claimed by Eska Martyrs Brigades accusing Israel of masterminding the attack.
[02:47:25.181 --> 02:47:34.183]  Arafat suggested the attack was an act of provocation carried out by Israel following the ruling by the International Court of Justice in The Hague against the West Bank security fence.
[02:47:34.783 --> 02:47:41.504]  Arafat said, we are against such kinds of bombings and you must never forget that the Israelis are completely behind it as they have been in the past.
[02:47:41.844 --> 02:47:44.825]  By the way, Israel, Yasser Arafat isn't the only person.
[02:47:44.845 --> 02:47:45.605]  I don't support him.
[02:47:45.685 --> 02:47:47.505]  He's Bilderberg, Minion.
[02:47:48.365 --> 02:47:49.585]  They're all together on this.
[02:47:49.885 --> 02:47:52.946]  It was Yitzhak Rabin, right before he was killed, said this.
[02:47:54.206 --> 02:47:56.367]  Speaking to reporters after the meeting of the U.N.
[02:47:56.447 --> 02:48:05.852]  Relief and Workers Agency, Commissioner General Peter Hanson, Arafat added, you know who is behind these acts, which are aimed at harming the court decision.
[02:48:05.952 --> 02:48:06.552]  Europe knows it.
[02:48:06.792 --> 02:48:10.374]  The Americans, the Egyptians, the Virginians, and the Israelis also know it.
[02:48:10.834 --> 02:48:18.958]  So see, it's becoming mainstream that governments blow up their own people to blame it on their enemy and keep the crisis going.
[02:48:21.459 --> 02:48:22.220]  Oh my gosh.
[02:48:23.837 --> 02:48:24.678]  Look at these articles.
[02:48:24.938 --> 02:48:35.387]  Birth control, pill and sewage, blame for sex change in fish, London Telegraph, and you're still drinking tap water, Prince, Sound's new nanotech alarm.
[02:48:36.569 --> 02:48:38.410]  Oh man, it's just so much, folks.
[02:48:38.450 --> 02:48:42.994]  We'll come back, take a few final calls, wrap up this global transmission against tyranny.
[02:48:43.034 --> 02:48:43.455]  Stay with us.
[02:48:44.978 --> 02:48:46.499]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:46.659 --> 02:48:49.742]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:49.882 --> 02:48:53.785]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:53.825 --> 02:48:58.069]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:58.409 --> 02:49:02.172]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:02.332 --> 02:49:04.154]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.664 --> 02:49:12.367]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:12.527 --> 02:49:15.588]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:15.748 --> 02:49:18.649]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:19.110 --> 02:49:25.232]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:25.752 --> 02:49:29.557]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:49:44.938 --> 02:49:47.939]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:49:48.279 --> 02:49:57.102]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments, like a local or national emergency.
[02:49:57.422 --> 02:50:02.104]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:02.564 --> 02:50:09.291]  The Berkelite is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:09.692 --> 02:50:21.484]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:21.944 --> 02:50:26.409]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:50:33.676 --> 02:50:34.717]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:50:45.333 --> 02:50:45.673]  I think so.
[02:51:00.558 --> 02:51:01.219]  We're good to go!
[02:51:30.077 --> 02:51:33.178]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:33.338 --> 02:51:39.321]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:46.464 --> 02:51:48.645]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:51:49.225 --> 02:51:52.006]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:54.660 --> 02:51:57.141]  Anti-war group says its ad is rejected.
[02:51:57.221 --> 02:52:16.246]  I just wanted to put up a billboard, a bunch of them, they're trying to buy them from Clear Channel, that owns most of the billboards, a large portion of them, that said, uh, red, white, and blue, uh, with the words, democracy is best taught by example, not war, and Clear Channel says, no, you can't buy billboards from us.
[02:52:18.127 --> 02:52:20.547]  I mean, come on, folks, and then they buy up everything?
[02:52:20.587 --> 02:52:23.108]  You see, this is the monopoly we're talking about?
[02:52:24.003 --> 02:52:25.183]  Very, very serious.
[02:52:25.964 --> 02:52:27.404]  And very, very dangerous.
[02:52:27.864 --> 02:52:31.165]  And again, we're not a democracy, we're a republic, we only quit using that term.
[02:52:31.505 --> 02:52:38.027]  But it wouldn't matter what the billboard said, as long as it wasn't profane, they should be able to buy that advertising.
[02:52:38.187 --> 02:52:41.388]  It's like gun ads can't be in most newspapers now.
[02:52:41.568 --> 02:52:43.028]  We just don't take that, they say.
[02:52:43.588 --> 02:52:45.109]  You see where this leads, folks?
[02:52:45.129 --> 02:52:50.010]  Before we talk to Bernard and Randy, and I'm trying to jam Mike in here,
[02:52:51.147 --> 02:53:00.893]  Before I do that, go to InfoWars.com and go to the secure online shopping cart and order my films and get them out to people and wake folks up.
[02:53:01.073 --> 02:53:01.953]  This is stuff I cover.
[02:53:01.973 --> 02:53:02.754]  It's all documented.
[02:53:02.774 --> 02:53:03.634]  It's not speculative.
[02:53:03.855 --> 02:53:04.475]  It's provable.
[02:53:04.515 --> 02:53:05.255]  It's demonstrable.
[02:53:05.456 --> 02:53:06.716]  And that's why it's so effective.
[02:53:06.976 --> 02:53:08.157]  Get my 9-11 films.

[02:53:28.429 --> 02:53:29.269]  We need your support.
[02:53:29.289 --> 02:53:30.050]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:53:30.070 --> 02:53:35.332]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[02:53:35.372 --> 02:53:36.873]  Bernard in Texas, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:53:45.518 --> 02:53:45.878]  Yes, sir.
[02:53:45.938 --> 02:53:47.059]  I'm going to keep it short today.
[02:53:47.079 --> 02:53:48.060]  I know you're short of time.
[02:53:48.100 --> 02:53:50.662]  Listen, you're my favorite person in the whole world.
[02:53:50.722 --> 02:53:52.483]  I'm going to address you as Dr. Jones.
[02:53:53.224 --> 02:53:54.825]  That's my dad, not me.
[02:53:54.845 --> 02:53:56.306]  Let me tell you something.
[02:53:57.107 --> 02:53:59.529]  Stick to your straightforward stuff.
[02:53:59.629 --> 02:54:01.150]  Your guest is a nice guy.
[02:54:01.350 --> 02:54:02.791]  He's got some good stuff.
[02:54:03.492 --> 02:54:06.814]  You've got to forget about faith and all.
[02:54:06.834 --> 02:54:10.337]  You've got to get out there and make some noise about real things.
[02:54:10.437 --> 02:54:12.679]  One thing I want to talk about is this woman, Bev Harris.
[02:54:12.699 --> 02:54:14.240]  This is the most important thing in the world.
[02:54:14.631 --> 02:54:20.374]  And I want to put a suggestion out to people to think about what we need to do about the vote.
[02:54:20.474 --> 02:54:22.795]  Think about all the elderly people.
[02:54:22.855 --> 02:54:24.816]  There's no way they can even vote!
[02:54:25.616 --> 02:54:28.857]  Why don't we vote on the telephone with a PIN number or your Social Security number?
[02:54:29.358 --> 02:54:32.539]  How many elderly people in this country will never
[02:54:33.163 --> 02:54:34.584]  be able to vote, and they know it.
[02:54:34.604 --> 02:54:38.107]  They've been cut out of Medicare, cheated in every way.
[02:54:38.187 --> 02:54:39.087]  It's just horrible.
[02:54:39.147 --> 02:54:40.048]  I want your comment.
[02:54:40.288 --> 02:54:45.832]  Well, yeah, a lot of older folks don't even know how to work, you know, any type of computer, and I don't blame them.
[02:54:45.852 --> 02:54:47.674]  They were never taught on them, and it's a great point.
[02:54:47.694 --> 02:54:48.274]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:48.554 --> 02:54:49.215]  Really good point.
[02:54:50.296 --> 02:54:51.156]  Who's up next here?
[02:54:52.637 --> 02:54:53.478]  Rodney in Texas.
[02:54:53.518 --> 02:54:54.098]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:54:54.319 --> 02:54:57.121]  Okay, something else that's very provable.
[02:54:57.201 --> 02:55:01.324]  Yesterday's Baltimore Sun, it was talking about how Julio Chavez
[02:55:02.113 --> 02:55:16.704]  President of Venezuela has decided to use the very corrupt voting machines that we have over here in our country and it even cited the company, Senator Chuck Hagel's company out of Omaha, Nebraska.
[02:55:17.405 --> 02:55:17.965]  Your comments?
[02:55:18.125 --> 02:55:18.726]  You gotta love it.
[02:55:18.786 --> 02:55:19.226]  Chuck Hagel.
[02:55:19.246 --> 02:55:25.291]  People vote for Chuck Hagel on his machines and he wins by landslides when the polls say the opposite.
[02:55:25.331 --> 02:55:26.272]  No, it's true.
[02:55:26.292 --> 02:55:27.493]  I mean, it's just a joke.
[02:55:28.313 --> 02:55:30.355]  And just one other thing Alex said.
[02:55:31.144 --> 02:55:34.725]  This has caused outrage over in Venezuela.
[02:55:34.765 --> 02:55:39.587]  The people over there, they're fully aware of it, but we're over here dead asleep.
[02:55:39.828 --> 02:55:40.888]  I hear you, thanks for the call.
[02:55:41.208 --> 02:55:43.009]  Mike in Ohio, last caller, go ahead.
[02:55:44.209 --> 02:55:44.509]  Hello?
[02:55:44.790 --> 02:55:45.050]  Yes.
[02:55:45.770 --> 02:55:50.292]  Yeah, I talked to a man that worked with a large corporation a couple years ago.
[02:55:50.632 --> 02:55:50.872]  Yes.
[02:55:51.052 --> 02:55:58.955]  And I asked him what the ISO might have to do with globalism and one world order, because they involve a lot of the corporations now.
[02:55:58.975 --> 02:56:00.656]  And he said he didn't think
[02:56:01.391 --> 02:56:03.233]  I don't seem to think that had anything to do with it.
[02:56:03.313 --> 02:56:03.773]  What do you think?
[02:56:04.254 --> 02:56:04.494]  What?
[02:56:04.654 --> 02:56:05.495]  I didn't hear what you said.
[02:56:05.535 --> 02:56:07.957]  International standardization, organization, technology.
[02:56:07.977 --> 02:56:11.861]  Oh, of course, yeah, and the OECD and all of them, it's diverged.
[02:56:11.881 --> 02:56:12.722]  Why wouldn't he tell me that?
[02:56:12.762 --> 02:56:13.983]  He didn't think that was part of it.
[02:56:14.263 --> 02:56:15.084]  Oh, that's ridiculous.
[02:56:15.144 --> 02:56:19.588]  I mean, state laws are all run past these boards that make sure they fit into all the treaties.
