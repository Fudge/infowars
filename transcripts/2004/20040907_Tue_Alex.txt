[00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.081]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.741 --> 00:00:07.782]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.503 --> 00:00:09.604]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.264 --> 00:00:11.085]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:12.726]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.187 --> 00:00:17.090]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.714]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.135 --> 00:00:23.835]  Music
[00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.934]  Well, my friends, we're coming up on the third year anniversary of the tragic events of September 11, 2001.
[00:00:43.414 --> 00:00:48.878]  It is the seventh day of September, 2004.
[00:00:48.918 --> 00:00:54.481]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, back from New York City.
[00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:58.284]  I hope you had a good holiday yesterday, obviously well-deserved.
[00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:16.987]  And we're not going to have any guests today because I want to go over all the latest news, the tragic events in Russia, the tragic events in Iraq, what I witnessed, the earth-shaking events I witnessed in New York City last week, and of course your phone calls.
[00:01:17.267 --> 00:01:20.709]  It is Tuesday, the 7th day of September 2004.
[00:01:26.061 --> 00:01:27.323]  Feels like Monday, though.
[00:01:27.343 --> 00:01:29.227]  Toll-free number to join us.
[00:01:29.387 --> 00:01:31.250]  We'll go to your calls early in this first hour.
[00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.330]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.411]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.571]  Well, the Detroit Free Press is telling us that probes redefine Bin Laden's role.
[00:01:46.091 --> 00:01:56.454]  Al-Qaeda seems to operate without his fortune, they find, because they're getting ready to obviously have the stage capture or claim they killed him, as we knew two and a half years ago and reported.
[00:01:57.794 --> 00:02:03.896]  And so now they've got to say the terror threat continues after the leader of Al-Qaeda is captured or killed.
[00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:08.006]  Other headline, this out of the Associated Press, U.S.
[00:02:08.046 --> 00:02:11.048]  near seizing bin Laden, officials say.
[00:02:12.528 --> 00:02:16.370]  And a big headline here, Rupert blows the lid off 9-11 in new book.
[00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.512]  Well, it looks like he has done a pretty good job, Mike Rupert.
[00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:28.676]  Of course, in my film, Masters of Terror, that we made, released exactly, this is the day, two years ago when I released that film,
[00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:38.349]  We get into the different drills, run on the morning of 9-11, of hijacked jets flying into the Pentagon and World Trade Center, and that was used to make NORAD stand down.
[00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.131]  We later learned about three other exercises.
[00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:48.094]  Well, Rupert says he's found five, so he's found one more that we didn't find, and they have links to these, so we'll be going over that.
[00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:51.416]  Boy, he's really getting on to the hot issues there, and we're glad.
[00:02:52.392 --> 00:02:55.453]  To see that, so we'll cover that as well.
[00:02:56.233 --> 00:02:59.934]  Also, dispute over identity of terror group.
[00:03:00.934 --> 00:03:02.795]  Dispute over identity of terror group.
[00:03:03.335 --> 00:03:04.595]  This is out of the Straits Times.
[00:03:04.755 --> 00:03:08.076]  The Chechens are saying they didn't do it, but Moscow says they did.
[00:03:08.236 --> 00:03:15.158]  All I know is Putin's been caught blowing up buildings before, clearly involved in the theater siege a few years ago.
[00:03:16.445 --> 00:03:19.668]  I don't know what to say about this, but it stinks to high heaven.
[00:03:19.968 --> 00:03:23.911]  Paul Watson has written an analysis of this that I agree with.
[00:03:23.991 --> 00:03:30.036]  We'll get into that report as well.
[00:03:30.197 --> 00:03:32.659]  And of course, old news is new news again.
[00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.382]  Bush took cocaine at Camp David.
[00:03:38.503 --> 00:03:42.006]  And this is taking cocaine back in the 80s.
[00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:45.760]  So we'll go over those articles.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.881]  Also, media being arrested in Iraq.
[00:03:51.081 --> 00:03:52.582]  Media being targeted and killed.
[00:03:53.582 --> 00:03:55.363]  It was almost that bad in New York.
[00:03:56.903 --> 00:04:01.545]  So we'll talk about those parallels here in our supposed free system.
[00:04:02.425 --> 00:04:07.787]  And out of South Korea, they've come out with a new RFID chip that's designed according to your DNA.
[00:04:08.347 --> 00:04:11.348]  And it's microscopic, and they just spray it onto you.
[00:04:11.368 --> 00:04:12.789]  Talk about Mark of the Beast.
[00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:19.815]  We'll be covering some of the new microscopic RFID developments.
[00:04:20.676 --> 00:04:34.246]  Damage from Hurricane Francis could be 15 billion, so a few weeks ago they got hit by one, and now they're hit by another, and that thing just sat there like a blender over Florida for days.
[00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:36.828]  Well, obviously you all saw that happen.
[00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:40.551]  Our hearts and prayers and everything goes out to those.
[00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:45.055]  Look, it's a big broadcast lined up for you.
[00:04:45.075 --> 00:04:47.977]  Getting in my stride here, so please stay with us.
[00:04:48.417 --> 00:04:54.902]  The websites are Infowars.com, Infowars.net, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:55.382 --> 00:04:57.483]  I'm Alex Jones, back in the saddle again.
[00:04:57.804 --> 00:04:58.284]  Stay with us.
[00:05:03.351 --> 00:05:08.852]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.252 --> 00:05:13.493]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:13.733 --> 00:05:20.775]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.135 --> 00:05:27.257]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.397 --> 00:05:28.597]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:28.777 --> 00:05:29.258]  We're good to go.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.824]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:05:48.844 --> 00:05:48.884]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:48.904 --> 00:05:49.044]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:50.085]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:05:50.125 --> 00:05:50.385]  Call today.
[00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:09.548]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:06:09.768 --> 00:06:21.039]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:23.902]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:24.242 --> 00:06:30.708]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:06:30.868 --> 00:06:32.750]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:38.975]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:39.215 --> 00:06:44.880]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.122]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:49.863]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.883 --> 00:06:50.863]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:21.613]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:21.693 --> 00:07:28.635]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:28.736 --> 00:07:30.836]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:31.116 --> 00:07:41.481]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:07:41.501 --> 00:07:42.301]  If you want to understand
[00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:43.381]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:43.441 --> 00:07:44.922]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.735 --> 00:08:14.658]  Alright, it is Tuesday, the 7th day of September 2004.
[00:08:14.738 --> 00:08:16.899]  Your calls are coming up at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:16.919 --> 00:08:33.630]  I want to take like 30 minutes out of the next hour and not take any calls and basically just blow by blow, go back in my memory and try to cover what happened on a daily basis in New York City.
[00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:34.971]  I think that's the best way to do it.
[00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:46.298]  For the Republican National Convention, and I've been over the weekend watching about six, seven hours of the 50-plus hours of videos.
[00:08:46.378 --> 00:08:48.040]  Every day I've been watching six, seven hours.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:56.987]  So I've had a chance to watch about 70% of the 50-plus hours that we shot there in New York City.
[00:08:57.047 --> 00:09:02.451]  So it's given me a chance to kind of collate mentally all the things that happened.
[00:09:03.115 --> 00:09:21.085]  So from the sound wave guns, to the Secret Service, to the surveillance blimps, to people being put in a concentration camp, to Arnold's disgusting speech, Zell Miller's disgusting speech, George Bush's out-of-control speech, Dick Cheney, all of it, we're going to be covering it.
[00:09:21.605 --> 00:09:24.987]  And by the way, if you just joined us, I'm not a Democrat.
[00:09:26.088 --> 00:09:26.488]  Okay?
[00:09:27.469 --> 00:09:28.449]  I'm a freedom lover.
[00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:29.490]  And I don't think...
[00:09:30.146 --> 00:09:32.106]  John Forbes Carey is going to save us.
[00:09:32.226 --> 00:09:34.167]  Bush's cousin isn't going to save us.
[00:09:34.607 --> 00:09:37.187]  In fact, I'm glad I just mentioned that.
[00:09:37.687 --> 00:09:41.728]  There was something I wanted to tell Stephanie, who's running the show, and I couldn't remember what it was.
[00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:48.149]  Stephanie, when you go to prisonplanet.com, on the right-hand corner, it says Alex on C-SPAN.
[00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:55.110]  When you grab that little minute rant I did and record that, I want people to be able to hear that audio.
[00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.211]  It really boils down the truth about the convention.
[00:10:00.453 --> 00:10:05.177]  As I did get on C-SPAN for a little bit while I was there, and that's quite a story in and of itself.
[00:10:05.277 --> 00:10:08.600]  Before I get into the tragic events in Russia, seven U.S.
[00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:18.868]  Marines killed yesterday in Iraq, before I get into all the new police state developments, and there's just so much of it here, let's just start with what happened in New York.
[00:10:19.728 --> 00:10:22.911]  And the best place to start is from JoinArnold.com.
[00:10:24.092 --> 00:10:26.834]  This is from Arnold Schwarzenegger's gubernatorial website.
[00:10:29.426 --> 00:10:33.370]  And it says, Governor Schwarzenegger's remarks at the Republican National Convention.
[00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:41.777]  Now, every paragraph of his speech is filled with lies and misrepresentations, but let's just take two paragraphs and analyze those.
[00:10:42.357 --> 00:10:49.784]  And I could do this with Bush's speech, I have it in front of me, I could do it with Zell Miller's, I could do it with Cheney's, all of them.
[00:10:49.804 --> 00:10:53.327]  When I was a boy, the Soviets occupied part of Austria.
[00:10:54.051 --> 00:10:55.673]  I saw the tanks in the streets.
[00:10:55.773 --> 00:10:58.155]  I saw communism with my own eyes.
[00:10:58.315 --> 00:11:02.659]  I remember the fear we had when we had to cross into the Soviet sector.
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.903]  Growing up, we were told, don't look at the soldiers in the eyes.
[00:11:07.344 --> 00:11:08.344]  Look straight ahead.
[00:11:09.045 --> 00:11:16.612]  It was a common belief that Soviet soldiers would take a man out of his own car and ship him off to the Soviet Union as slave labor.
[00:11:18.013 --> 00:11:19.555]  My family didn't have a car.
[00:11:20.413 --> 00:11:22.515]  But one day we were in my uncle's car.
[00:11:22.555 --> 00:11:25.577]  It was near dark as we came to a Soviet checkpoint.
[00:11:26.037 --> 00:11:27.158]  I was a little boy.
[00:11:28.159 --> 00:11:30.200]  I wasn't an action hero back then.
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:37.706]  And I remember how scared I was that the Soviets could pull my father or my uncle out of the car and I'd never see him again.
[00:11:38.066 --> 00:11:43.210]  My family and so many others lived in fear of the Soviet boot.
[00:11:44.187 --> 00:11:50.635]  Today, the world no longer fears the Soviet Union, and it is because of the United States of America.
[00:11:52.457 --> 00:11:52.678]  Okay.
[00:11:54.682 --> 00:11:58.023]  Now, you read those two paragraphs, that's exactly what I was living in New York.
[00:11:58.083 --> 00:12:02.923]  If you look cops in the eye, and by the way, I have this on video at least three times a day, they would run over screaming at you.
[00:12:03.003 --> 00:12:07.664]  I mean outside the convention, outside the five city blocks that were in the national security event.
[00:12:08.064 --> 00:12:10.585]  In front of fountains, in a little park.
[00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:14.265]  I tried to do an intro, and police would run over screaming, threatening to arrest us.
[00:12:15.126 --> 00:12:16.026]  We were detained.
[00:12:16.466 --> 00:12:18.126]  I was grabbed and shoved around.
[00:12:18.886 --> 00:12:22.647]  One of our people that was with us had her camera taken and had it smashed open in front of us.
[00:12:25.518 --> 00:12:26.278]  They were arrogant.
[00:12:26.318 --> 00:12:27.999]  They were on a complete power trip.
[00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:29.660]  It had nothing to do with terrorism.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:38.363]  People were secretly arrested and not charged until a state judge ordered them to release thousands of people out of a camp who hadn't even been charged.
[00:12:38.663 --> 00:12:41.884]  Tourists, citizens, were just randomly scooped up.
[00:12:44.445 --> 00:12:48.787]  You talk about checkpoints, you talk about the Patriot Act, you talk about being disappeared...
[00:12:50.956 --> 00:12:56.719]  That's exactly what Homeland Security and the Patriot Act and the new domestic CIA are doing and setting up.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:03.883]  And so there are two paragraphs out of Arnold's speech and it's exactly what's starting to happen in this country.
[00:13:05.244 --> 00:13:08.986]  And then of course, Arnold, you tell us about being afraid of being scooped up and picked up.
[00:13:10.046 --> 00:13:11.427]  Your father...
[00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:14.770]  Where'd you grow up?
[00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:16.331]  In Graz, or whatever you call it.
[00:13:16.991 --> 00:13:18.171]  A suburb of a big city.
[00:13:18.211 --> 00:13:19.812]  Your father was a police chief.
[00:13:19.852 --> 00:13:22.733]  He was an SS officer in World War II.
[00:13:23.413 --> 00:13:25.293]  You were the product of an SS marriage.
[00:13:25.333 --> 00:13:27.214]  Your older brother was born during World War II.
[00:13:27.234 --> 00:13:29.895]  You were born right after World War II in 1946.
[00:13:34.774 --> 00:13:40.056]  And when your father died, your mommy married a former SS colonel who was the head of the Austrian parliament.
[00:13:40.076 --> 00:13:46.638]  And you campaigned for Kirk Valtine, the former UN Secretary General, who was then running for president in Austria.
[00:13:46.778 --> 00:13:48.299]  And you said, I don't care if he's a Nazi.
[00:13:48.339 --> 00:13:48.799]  We love him.
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:55.101]  You said that you always dreamed of powerful dictators like Hitler and wanted to be like them.
[00:13:55.441 --> 00:13:58.022]  You know, you're just a leader and other people will follow us.
[00:14:00.925 --> 00:14:02.626]  So it's not just that you're a hypocrite.
[00:14:02.886 --> 00:14:06.367]  It's not just that California's been turned into a total police state and you're accelerating it.
[00:14:07.788 --> 00:14:13.270]  You've got the Republicans out there like Senator Orrin Hatch, who I did see at the convention, walking around.
[00:14:14.051 --> 00:14:19.833]  You've got Lord Hatch, who's introduced a bill to repeal the 22nd Amendment so you can be president.
[00:14:20.173 --> 00:14:20.994]  It's disgusting!
[00:14:22.434 --> 00:14:23.375]  It's unbelievable!
[00:14:24.115 --> 00:14:25.275]  Arnold's the new Republican.
[00:14:25.356 --> 00:14:28.517]  Pro-abortion, anti-gun, pro-open border.
[00:14:30.876 --> 00:14:31.696]  Love Shetler.
[00:14:33.617 --> 00:14:34.357]  Hates freedom.
[00:14:35.058 --> 00:14:36.238]  That's your new Republican.
[00:14:37.259 --> 00:14:42.821]  And I had so many arguments with Republicans there, you know, well-meaning, grassroots Republicans who just think Bush is God or something.
[00:14:43.281 --> 00:14:49.263]  And I'd point out the government's growth rate has doubled, and I'd point out the loss of liberties, and it was like talking to a brick wall or something.
[00:14:49.283 --> 00:14:53.625]  They're on this power trip, associating their power with the great leaders.
[00:14:56.611 --> 00:15:03.255]  And he also went into a debate between Nixon and the person he was running against in 1968 and said, that's when I decided to be a Republican.
[00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:07.277]  The problem is, is that that debate never happened.
[00:15:07.297 --> 00:15:09.579]  Nixon refused to debate.
[00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:11.560]  I finally arrived here in 1968.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.102]  I had empty pockets, but I was full of dreams.
[00:15:15.442 --> 00:15:17.663]  The presidential campaign was in full swing.
[00:15:17.743 --> 00:15:21.666]  I remember watching the Nixon and Humphreys presidential race on TV.
[00:15:22.066 --> 00:15:25.628]  A friend who spoke German and English translated for me.
[00:15:26.128 --> 00:15:32.131]  I heard Humphrey saying things that sounded like socialism, which is what I had just left.
[00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:33.652]  But then I heard Nixon speak.
[00:15:33.692 --> 00:15:38.914]  He was talking about free enterprise, getting government off your back, lowering taxes and strengthening the military.
[00:15:39.194 --> 00:15:42.215]  Listening to Nixon speak sounded more like a breath of fresh air.
[00:15:42.236 --> 00:15:44.457]  I said to my friend, what party is he?
[00:15:44.497 --> 00:15:45.697]  My friend said, he's a Republican.
[00:15:45.977 --> 00:15:48.278]  I said that I am a Republican.
[00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:50.379]  And I've been a Republican ever since.
[00:15:50.699 --> 00:15:54.121]  And trust me, in my wife's family, that's no small achievement.
[00:15:56.826 --> 00:16:05.389]  Well, that's funny, because you talk about this debate you saw that never happened.
[00:16:06.429 --> 00:16:07.409]  So, another lie.
[00:16:07.429 --> 00:16:08.910]  It's just the whole thing.
[00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:16.812]  I could go paragraph by paragraph and read the whole speech, and that's just indicative of all the other speeches.
[00:16:17.873 --> 00:16:18.733]  Sounds great!
[00:16:19.574 --> 00:16:20.614]  But it isn't true.
[00:16:21.074 --> 00:16:38.140]  All this talk about freedom from the neocons, when they're the ones setting up America to be a giant gulag, with Nazis as the functionaries, and hiring General Primakov to help head up Homeland Security, a former KGB chief, and Putin running around worshipping Bush and saying the war is good.
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:38.920]  Duh.
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:45.102]  I mean, look at the collection of people here trying to run this system we all live in.
[00:16:48.422 --> 00:16:50.625]  New York was martial law itself.
[00:16:50.665 --> 00:16:52.567]  It wasn't getting close.
[00:16:52.587 --> 00:16:53.868]  It wasn't a few steps away.
[00:16:54.289 --> 00:16:55.871]  It was martial law.
[00:16:56.752 --> 00:16:57.953]  There was no law.
[00:16:58.193 --> 00:17:00.996]  But the law of the establishment and whatever they said it was.
[00:17:01.377 --> 00:17:03.159]  People were being arrested all around me.
[00:17:03.219 --> 00:17:05.161]  I was threatened with arrest over and over again.
[00:17:05.181 --> 00:17:06.703]  And I had to stand up to them.
[00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:14.495]  And navigate very carefully and threaten to sue police not to be arrested and still they erased my videos.
[00:17:15.116 --> 00:17:17.818]  Other reporters we were with had their videos stolen.
[00:17:18.418 --> 00:17:20.100]  I watched cameras be smashed.
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:23.282]  It had nothing to do with security or the convention.
[00:17:24.203 --> 00:17:26.085]  I would be with permitted protest.
[00:17:26.861 --> 00:17:30.823]  At Ground Zero, I watched hundreds of people arrested, peaceably standing there.
[00:17:30.843 --> 00:17:53.975]  They would use what they called Freedom Fence, this big orange fencing to capture people like minnows in a net and throw them in paddy wagons and beat the living daylights out of tourists and take them to Pier 57, an admitted emergency camp in a condemned building that even the news admitted had asbestos hanging out of the walls with barbed wire fences inside of the old bus terminal.
[00:17:54.933 --> 00:18:06.281]  Out over the Hudson River, Guantanamo on the Hudson, and in years, decades of oil and chemicals on the floors and people getting all these huge rashes and not even being charged, not even being enrolled.
[00:18:06.721 --> 00:18:18.069]  We're talking about 16-year-olds coming back from different meetings who weren't even politically involved, being arrested and their mothers not knowing where they are for three, four days.
[00:18:18.409 --> 00:18:19.970]  That was in the New York newspapers.
[00:18:22.239 --> 00:18:23.479]  But not nationally.
[00:18:23.499 --> 00:18:28.241]  I was in protest with over 300,000 people, and the national news would say, thousands protest.
[00:18:29.982 --> 00:18:31.302]  Not a lie, it was thousands.
[00:18:32.743 --> 00:18:34.363]  But a manipulation of the facts.
[00:18:34.403 --> 00:18:35.404]  It was hundreds of thousands.
[00:18:36.624 --> 00:18:48.028]  And the best news I've got for you is that on the first day, I must have talked to 200 people who were fans of this radio show, who know about the New World Order, who aren't left or right, but are freedom lovers.
[00:18:49.289 --> 00:18:51.330]  And it must have been 500 by the end of the trip.
[00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:56.791]  Most of them New Yorkers, other people from Kansas City and Los Angeles.
[00:18:56.911 --> 00:18:57.912]  It's amazing.
[00:18:57.992 --> 00:19:00.672]  Black people, white people, old people, young people.
[00:19:01.133 --> 00:19:02.913]  It was very exciting.
[00:19:04.194 --> 00:19:05.434]  We had communists threaten us.
[00:19:06.505 --> 00:19:08.345]  The provocateurs working for the feds.
[00:19:08.986 --> 00:19:10.486]  We witness provocateur actions.
[00:19:10.526 --> 00:19:11.546]  We'll talk about all of it.
[00:19:11.846 --> 00:19:17.808]  When we get back, though, we'll go to some calls and then back into the Russian situation, the Iraq situation, and much more.
[00:19:17.888 --> 00:19:20.828]  Toll-free number to join us on this Tuesday edition.
[00:19:20.888 --> 00:19:21.869]  Again, feels like Monday.
[00:19:21.889 --> 00:19:21.949]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:21.969 --> 00:19:22.489]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:22.709 --> 00:19:23.349]  And we'll get you up.
[00:19:33.741 --> 00:19:34.961]  And on the air.
[00:19:35.421 --> 00:19:36.442]  So please stay with us.
[00:19:36.482 --> 00:19:43.103]  And again, the websites are prisonplanet.tv, infowars.com, and prisonplanet.com.
[00:19:43.123 --> 00:19:52.144]  Detailed analysis of the geopolitical spectrum and your calls when this transmission continues after these quick and important messages.
[00:19:52.184 --> 00:19:54.985]  And remember, we shall prevail against this tyranny.
[00:19:55.025 --> 00:19:58.346]  We shall expose the terrorists that carried out 9-11.
[00:20:01.229 --> 00:20:02.089]  Terrorism.
[00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.910]  Terrorism.
[00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.850]  Chemical attacks.
[00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:04.570]  Dirty bombs.
[00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:05.091]  Fallout.
[00:20:05.171 --> 00:20:06.151]  Biological attack.
[00:20:06.331 --> 00:20:06.871]  Anthrax.
[00:20:06.951 --> 00:20:09.052]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:20:09.332 --> 00:20:10.933]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:20:11.153 --> 00:20:13.634]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:20:14.014 --> 00:20:28.600]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:28.960]  government.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.901]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:20:31.301 --> 00:20:37.206]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:20:37.346 --> 00:20:41.869]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[00:20:42.109 --> 00:20:49.194]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:20:49.414 --> 00:20:51.516]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:21:00.561 --> 00:21:01.101]  We're good to go.
[00:21:27.807 --> 00:21:28.327]  We're good to go.
[00:21:28.347 --> 00:21:28.928]  We're good to go.
[00:22:00.356 --> 00:22:07.298]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America, why the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[00:22:08.559 --> 00:22:12.620]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:20.382]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain and Western Europe.
[00:22:21.282 --> 00:22:30.045]  You need to know as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America why these things are happening and what you can do about it

[00:24:25.084 --> 00:24:26.745]  Bob in Texas, you're first up.
[00:24:26.785 --> 00:24:27.446]  Thanks for holding.
[00:24:27.466 --> 00:24:27.806]  Welcome.
[00:24:29.147 --> 00:24:29.628]  Good morning.
[00:24:30.763 --> 00:24:33.045]  Alex, I'm glad you got back in one piece.
[00:24:33.626 --> 00:24:36.028]  I'm calling because I've just come into some information.
[00:24:36.068 --> 00:24:37.369]  I don't know if you're aware of it or not.
[00:24:37.389 --> 00:24:39.671]  I would have felt remiss if I hadn't gotten it to you.
[00:24:40.331 --> 00:24:42.794]  Have you heard about a threat against Austin?
[00:24:44.955 --> 00:24:54.664]  Yeah, while I was out of town, some people that I know, local business owners, talked directly to someone who works for Homeland Security and they said, oh, Austin's a big target.
[00:24:55.661 --> 00:24:57.221]  You know, be out of town this weekend.
[00:24:57.262 --> 00:24:58.162]  That was last week.
[00:24:58.222 --> 00:25:00.362]  Nothing, thank God, happened this weekend.
[00:25:00.902 --> 00:25:13.926]  And then one of our National Guard slash police officer connections said that they'd been told to get ready by November 1st for some big attack, but I never went with it on the show because I couldn't document it one way or the other.
[00:25:14.906 --> 00:25:19.688]  You know, this came from James McCaney's website.
[00:25:19.728 --> 00:25:24.649]  He said he just got off the Brent Johnson's Voice of Freedom radio show, and he said he got it from
[00:25:25.527 --> 00:25:34.156]  Yeah, but I'm telling you, sir, that this story started a week ago, and they do tell Homeland Security people, get ready, they'll probably be attacked.
[00:25:34.977 --> 00:25:41.323]  I mean, this is what they do all over the country to get fear going and to train the local establishments to go under federal control.
[00:25:41.623 --> 00:25:44.146]  I just thought I'd pass it on just in case you hadn't heard about it.
[00:25:44.967 --> 00:25:47.089]  Oh, no, it is interesting, and I'm glad you called about it.
[00:25:47.109 --> 00:25:48.170]  We should talk about it, but...
[00:25:48.746 --> 00:25:55.388]  I mean, the government puts out these fake terror alerts and tells their own people brace for an attack on a daily basis in different regions of the country.
[00:25:55.848 --> 00:26:02.049]  They've also been having terror drills, anti-terror drills, covert drills in Austin over the last month.
[00:26:02.069 --> 00:26:03.789]  They just had another one about a week ago.
[00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:15.312]  Well, I see Dick Gregory, Ted Gunnarsson, and a guy named Hilder going around the country giving lectures and just coming right out and saying 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:26:16.624 --> 00:26:21.465]  These guys are going to have to do something, or they're going to have to pay the price.
[00:26:21.645 --> 00:26:25.026]  I wouldn't doubt they're going to pull something off here pretty soon.
[00:26:25.066 --> 00:26:26.506]  There's little doubt about that.
[00:26:26.626 --> 00:26:29.327]  Well, anyway, I just wanted to get that to you just in case you hadn't heard about it.
[00:26:29.567 --> 00:26:29.927]  All right.
[00:26:29.947 --> 00:26:31.387]  Well, I appreciate the call.
[00:26:31.587 --> 00:26:33.887]  Now, I know the source of those stories.
[00:26:34.908 --> 00:26:41.489]  Two separate individuals within Homeland Security, and this is what they're being told, and it didn't happen.
[00:26:42.171 --> 00:26:43.632]  I never went with it on the broadcast.
[00:26:44.952 --> 00:27:01.780]  Speaking of the globalists having to make a move because everybody's waking up to who carried out 9-11, there were thousands and thousands, supposedly 10,000, of these 9-11 cover-up signs handed out to the tens of thousands of protesters in New York.
[00:27:02.737 --> 00:27:08.819]  They were everywhere, but I saw hundreds of homemade signs that said 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:27:08.919 --> 00:27:14.200]  I saw dozens of Infowars.com homemade signs, and that's just what I saw.
[00:27:15.501 --> 00:27:21.202]  But I do have the Zogby poll that we talked about last week here in front of me, and I'll tell you what I'll do.
[00:27:21.222 --> 00:27:23.303]  When we get back from break, I'll dig that out.
[00:27:23.723 --> 00:27:25.964]  We'll actually read that Zogby poll on air.
[00:27:27.347 --> 00:27:32.732]  Around half of New Yorkers believe the government had prior knowledge or was involved in 9-11.
[00:27:33.592 --> 00:27:34.913]  And that's what I got on the street.
[00:27:35.754 --> 00:27:39.157]  About, I don't know, a third of the people think the government was behind it.
[00:27:39.197 --> 00:27:42.199]  Another third think the government had prior knowledge and let it happen.
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:47.223]  And the other third we talked to have questions and think that they at least screwed up.
[00:27:48.504 --> 00:27:53.248]  And Zogby is the most respected polling agency in the country, bar none.
[00:27:54.289 --> 00:27:55.110]  The most respected.
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:01.363]  Just type in Zogby highly respected into a search engine and all these mainstream news articles will pop up about it.
[00:28:01.863 --> 00:28:08.448]  And Zogby's being totally ignored by this professional poll they did now eight days ago.
[00:28:09.528 --> 00:28:11.289]  This poll came out the 30th.
[00:28:13.671 --> 00:28:15.852]  And so we'll be going over that poll.
[00:28:15.932 --> 00:28:18.854]  But yes, I've been saying since before 9-11 that 9-11 would be an inside job.
[00:28:20.993 --> 00:28:29.377]  I've been on record since July 25, 2001, now two years and two months ago, saying call the White House, tell them don't do it.
[00:28:30.417 --> 00:28:36.880]  And then day one, on the day of 9-11, I got on air and said it was an inside job from all the evidence, Operation Northwoods and the rest of it.
[00:28:38.241 --> 00:28:43.503]  And I've been on record from day one saying that, and then the evidence has just piled up documenting that.
[00:28:43.943 --> 00:28:45.864]  Not prior knowledge, but involvement.
[00:28:48.084 --> 00:28:53.165]  And so, yes, there are a lot of people all over the country telling the truth, getting the word out.
[00:28:53.825 --> 00:28:55.886]  And that's why the globalists are in a lot of trouble.
[00:28:56.086 --> 00:29:00.887]  They can try to continue the illusion that everybody that thinks like we do are the minority.
[00:29:01.507 --> 00:29:08.108]  And so we all sit here compartmentalized in our homes and apartments at night, feeling like we're by ourselves and like we're crazy.
[00:29:08.768 --> 00:29:13.209]  No, my friends, I've done over 1,600, it's got to be over 1,700, I quit counting at 1,600 three or four months ago, over 1,600 radio interviews.
[00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:25.096]  And almost every caller, maybe one out of 30, disagrees with me about 9-11 and thinks it was all Al-CIA about themselves.
[00:29:26.337 --> 00:29:27.939]  And these are liberal, conservative shows.
[00:29:27.979 --> 00:29:30.060]  I talk about that all the time because it's good news.
[00:29:30.381 --> 00:29:31.602]  The people know the truth.
[00:29:31.742 --> 00:29:35.565]  But the people that know that truth say, oh, I feel like I'm alone.
[00:29:35.585 --> 00:29:37.166]  I didn't know anybody thought like this.
[00:29:38.127 --> 00:29:39.668]  Well, go look at your Zogby poll.
[00:29:40.869 --> 00:29:43.171]  All right, it's all coming up and more calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:47.091 --> 00:29:47.632]  Stay with us.
[00:29:47.652 --> 00:29:48.413]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.136 --> 00:29:52.057]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.537 --> 00:29:54.139]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.743]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.136 --> 00:30:03.618]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:30:03.818 --> 00:30:11.165]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:30:11.465 --> 00:30:15.890]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:26.000]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cubes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[00:30:26.741 --> 00:30:30.425]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[00:30:30.745 --> 00:30:33.248]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[00:30:33.548 --> 00:30:39.475]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[00:30:39.715 --> 00:30:41.277]  These days that's just plain smart.
[00:30:41.517 --> 00:30:42.418]  Friends, don't wait.
[00:30:42.498 --> 00:30:45.499]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[00:30:45.639 --> 00:30:48.821]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[00:30:49.081 --> 00:30:51.122]  That's 800-255-1912.

[00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:23.711]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[00:31:24.031 --> 00:31:33.401]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:31:33.661 --> 00:31:37.165]  It even reduces Radon 222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:08.882]  We at ActiveX America Incorporated would like to thank our faithful customers for making SynFlex one of the leading glucosamine and chondroitin formulas on the market today.
[00:32:09.442 --> 00:32:23.366]  Our liquid glucosamine complex not only combines pharmaceutical quality glucosamine and chondroitin, but also contains natural anti-inflammatories that can help reduce pain and inflammation without the harmful side effects that can occur from taking pharmaceutical drugs.
[00:32:23.786 --> 00:32:24.306]  We're good to go.
[00:32:45.515 --> 00:32:45.855]  We're good to go.
[00:33:17.817 --> 00:33:19.678]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:20.278 --> 00:33:22.378]  Crashing the lives.
[00:33:23.199 --> 00:33:24.119]  Disinformation.
[00:33:24.739 --> 00:33:28.300]  All right, Keith and Mike and many others, your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.761]  800-259-9231.
[00:33:31.581 --> 00:33:40.683]  But first off, this is a good way to introduce this Zogby poll that I'm finally here in the studio and I can cover in detail for you about most people thinking the government was behind 9-11.
[00:33:41.083 --> 00:33:42.244]  Oh yeah, major bull.
[00:33:42.704 --> 00:33:43.484]  What's going to do about that?
[00:33:43.924 --> 00:33:45.385]  Bad boys when we come for you.
[00:33:45.405 --> 00:33:46.805]  What are you going to do when we come for you?
[00:33:48.334 --> 00:34:01.758]  But here I am on C-SPAN, and to set this up, it was Wednesday night, and Lord Cheney and Lord Miller had just spoken.
[00:34:02.778 --> 00:34:16.802]  Everybody was starting to let out, and I'd been inside covering the convention, but then I was across the street at a restaurant getting something to eat, inside the security perimeter at the national security event right across the street from Madison Square Garden.
[00:34:17.686 --> 00:34:35.184]  And in the bar slash restaurant, they had the TV on C-SPAN, and it showed C-SPAN with lines of delegates, giving each delegate about 30 to 45 seconds to maybe a minute and a half, depending on the delegate, to talk about how much they loved Bush and how conservative he was, and I didn't agree with that.
[00:34:35.684 --> 00:34:41.410]  So I marched out there, back through the main security perimeter, back in front of MSG, Madison Square Garden,
[00:34:42.356 --> 00:34:45.479]  And saw, it wasn't Brian Lamb, it was like his number two guy.
[00:34:45.519 --> 00:34:46.540]  And I said, hey, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:47.541]  He's like, oh, I know who you are.
[00:34:47.561 --> 00:34:49.042]  And I said, well, don't censor me.
[00:34:49.083 --> 00:34:51.205]  Brian Lamb, you know, talked about me for hours.
[00:34:51.285 --> 00:34:55.328]  And will you please put me on television just for 30 seconds or so?
[00:34:55.348 --> 00:34:59.072]  And he said, all right, but I'll give you a signal with my hand when we're about to cut away from you.
[00:35:01.014 --> 00:35:02.095]  And so they cut to me.
[00:35:05.572 --> 00:35:15.818]  So they cut to me, and this is what I had to say on national television right after they had broken up Wednesday night's convention.
[00:35:15.838 --> 00:35:16.398]  So here it is.
[00:35:17.059 --> 00:35:20.901]  Go back outside of Madison Square Garden for more delegate reaction.
[00:35:21.605 --> 00:35:26.729]  And Susan, of course, the floor is empty, but they're here, and we'd be accused of not hearing all voices.
[00:35:26.769 --> 00:35:28.069]  We cut you off a moment ago.
[00:35:28.129 --> 00:35:30.831]  This is Alex Jones from Austin, Texas, the radio talk show host.
[00:35:30.971 --> 00:35:31.332]  Yes, sir.
[00:35:31.352 --> 00:35:34.053]  With InfoWars.com, both candidates are cousins.
[00:35:34.073 --> 00:35:34.954]  They're skull and bones.
[00:35:35.174 --> 00:35:36.675]  They're bringing in big government and tyranny.
[00:35:36.895 --> 00:35:37.616]  The evidence is clear.
[00:35:37.636 --> 00:35:40.978]  The military-industrial complex was intimately involved in 9-11.
[00:35:41.158 --> 00:35:42.919]  The commission is a complete fraud.
[00:35:43.119 --> 00:35:44.220]  We're losing our freedoms.
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:45.381]  Both parties are controlled.
[00:35:45.581 --> 00:35:49.244]  And if we don't wake up and stand up and speak out, this country's going to be destroyed.
[00:35:49.304 --> 00:35:51.245]  Giving up liberty only gives us tyranny.
[00:35:51.645 --> 00:35:59.850]  It does not give us security, and I hope that everybody out there wakes up to this and realizes that America is America because we have the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:03.192]  Everybody should investigate 9-11 and find out who's really behind it.
[00:36:03.412 --> 00:36:07.955]  It's Bush's and the New World Order's Reichstag, and his cousin Kerry isn't going to save you either.
[00:36:08.135 --> 00:36:09.676]  Thank you, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:36:10.156 --> 00:36:13.598]  Alex Jones, okay, now... All right, so there you have it.
[00:36:13.678 --> 00:36:16.060]  Now let's get to the Zogby poll that had come out...
[00:36:16.678 --> 00:36:32.509]  Two days, three days before I made that little comment there at the Republican National Convention, literally surrounded by men in black uniforms, black helmets, with M16s, giant sound cannons over me, a blimp, and at least four helicopters swarming overhead.
[00:36:32.549 --> 00:36:34.450]  It was like something out of King Kong or something.
[00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:35.611]  But here it is.
[00:36:36.801 --> 00:36:39.523]  Half of New Yorkers believe U.S.
[00:36:39.703 --> 00:36:49.591]  leaders had foreknowledge of impending 9-11 attacks and consciously failed to act.
[00:36:49.611 --> 00:36:57.317]  66% call for new probe of unanswered questions by Congress or New York's Attorney General, new Zogby International poll reveals.
[00:36:58.251 --> 00:37:09.460]  This is from www.zogby.com forward slash news forward slash read news dot d b m question mark id equals 855.
[00:37:11.261 --> 00:37:18.367]  Now you can go to prisonplanet.com and on the right hand side it says Zogby Poll and then you can click there and then link through.
[00:37:18.407 --> 00:37:21.249]  We have the story saved but there's a link to the actual Zogby page.
[00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:22.771]  This is Zogby!
[00:37:23.691 --> 00:37:24.312]  Zogby!
[00:37:24.772 --> 00:37:26.834]  The most... This is not debated.
[00:37:27.446 --> 00:37:31.707]  The most accurate polling system in the United States.
[00:37:33.148 --> 00:37:55.995]  On the eve of the Republican National Convention invoking 9-11 symbols, sound bites and imagery, half, or 49.3% of New York City residents and 41% of New York citizens overall say that some of our leaders knew in advance that attacks were planned on or around September 11, 2001 and that they consciously failed to act according to the poll conducted by Zogby International.
[00:37:56.697 --> 00:37:58.811]  The poll of New York residents was conducted...
[00:38:00.362 --> 00:38:10.067]  From Tuesday, August 24th, through Thursday, August 26th, 2004, overall results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5% plus or minus.
[00:38:10.467 --> 00:38:14.989]  The poll is the first of its kind conducted in America that surveys attitudes regarding U.S.
[00:38:15.009 --> 00:38:17.210]  government complicity in the 9-11 tragedy.
[00:38:17.471 --> 00:38:28.136]  Despite the acute legal and political implications of this accusation, nearly 30% of registered Republicans and 38% of those who describe themselves as very conservative supported the claim.
[00:38:29.085 --> 00:38:32.407]  The charge found very high support among adults under 30, 62.8%.
[00:38:32.468 --> 00:38:32.848]  62.8% of people under 30.
[00:38:32.968 --> 00:38:33.788]  African Americans of all ages, 62.5%.
[00:38:33.828 --> 00:38:34.229]  Hispanics, 60.1%.
[00:38:34.749 --> 00:38:34.989]  Asians, 59.4%.
[00:38:35.029 --> 00:38:37.251]  And the lowest group, born-again evangelical Christians at 47.9%.
[00:38:37.291 --> 00:38:38.792]  Because a lot of them are fooled and think Bush is...
[00:38:53.536 --> 00:38:54.977]  Some type of Christ-like creature.
[00:38:55.318 --> 00:38:57.379]  Yeah, skull and bones, Bohemian Grove, real Christian.
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:05.827]  Less than 2 in 5, 36% believe that the 9-11 Commission had answered all important questions about what actually happened on September 11, 2001.
[00:39:06.287 --> 00:39:17.957]  And 2 in 3, 66% New Yorkers, and 56.2% overall, called for another full investigation of the still unanswered questions by Congress or Eliot Spitzer's New York's Attorney General.
[00:39:18.721 --> 00:39:29.151]  Self-identified, very liberal New Yorkers supported a new inquiry by a margin of 3 to 1, but so did half, or 53%, of very conservative citizens across the state.
[00:39:29.351 --> 00:39:32.414]  People who call themselves very conservative, 53%, call for investigation.
[00:39:33.177 --> 00:39:39.581]  The call for a deeper probe was especially strong among Hispanics, 75.6%, African Americans, 75.3% citizens, with an income from $15,000 to $25,000, 74.3%.
[00:39:39.641 --> 00:39:41.081]  Women, 62%, and evangelical Christians, 59.9%.
[00:39:41.342 --> 00:39:46.164]  With David Kubecky, executive director of 911truth.org, the group that commissioned the poll expressed genuine surprise that New Yorkers
[00:40:00.956 --> 00:40:06.841]  A belief in the administration complicity is at a high or higher than that seen overseas.
[00:40:07.021 --> 00:40:10.244]  See, they've done foreign polls, which show the same numbers are lower.
[00:40:10.844 --> 00:40:17.149]  We're familiar with high levels of 9-11 skepticism abroad, where there has been open debate of the evidence for U.S.
[00:40:17.189 --> 00:40:17.950]  government complicity.
[00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:20.212]  And I've been calling for a poll for several years.
[00:40:21.312 --> 00:40:27.896]  On May 26th, the Toronto Star reported a national poll showing that 63% of Canadians are also convinced U.S.
[00:40:27.956 --> 00:40:31.318]  leaders had prior knowledge of the attacks, yet declined to act.
[00:40:31.639 --> 00:40:32.539]  There was no U.S.
[00:40:32.579 --> 00:40:36.842]  coverage of this startling poll or the facts supporting the Canadians' conclusions.
[00:40:37.182 --> 00:40:42.943]  And there has been virtually no debate on the victim's family's scores of still unanswered questions.
[00:40:43.303 --> 00:40:51.605]  I think these numbers show that most New Yorkers are now fed up with the silence and that the politicians trying to exploit 9-11 do so at their peril.
[00:40:51.825 --> 00:40:55.726]  The 9-11 case is not closed and New York's questions are not going away.
[00:40:57.486 --> 00:40:58.226]  Okay, there's more.
[00:40:58.246 --> 00:40:59.307]  I'll read more of it later.
[00:40:59.347 --> 00:41:00.287]  It gets even worse.
[00:41:01.367 --> 00:41:03.127]  But what you gonna do, bad boys?
[00:41:03.187 --> 00:41:05.088]  What you gonna do when they come for you?
[00:41:05.128 --> 00:41:06.148]  When we come for you?
[00:41:08.286 --> 00:41:10.207]  I've seen the polls from 30 years ago.
[00:41:10.227 --> 00:41:15.069]  What was it, like 10% of Americans believed the government was involved in the Kennedy assassination?
[00:41:15.869 --> 00:41:17.350]  Then three or four years ago, it was 80%.
[00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:23.892]  At the 40th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination, I averaged 12 national polls together.
[00:41:24.872 --> 00:41:26.253]  I sat there with my calculator.
[00:41:26.293 --> 00:41:27.493]  They were between 85% and 95%.
[00:41:27.874 --> 00:41:33.016]  I averaged 12 polls together, wrote an article about it.
[00:41:33.036 --> 00:41:36.717]  92% of Americans believed the government was involved in killing Kennedy.
[00:41:37.825 --> 00:41:40.390]  92%.
[00:41:37.845 --> 00:41:40.390]  So what's it going to be next year?
[00:41:40.411 --> 00:41:40.390]  100%?
[00:41:40.431 --> 00:41:41.072]  99%?
[00:41:40.491 --> 00:41:41.072]  It's the same thing with 9-11.
[00:41:41.132 --> 00:41:41.653]  I told you years ago.
[00:41:49.457 --> 00:41:51.939]  Remember just a few years ago, they had the foreign polls.
[00:41:51.959 --> 00:41:53.060]  A small percentage thought it.
[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:54.080]  Now a majority thinks it.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.901]  Now we have polls in the U.S.
[00:41:56.322 --> 00:42:08.350]  I predict within two years, unless the globalists nuke a city and have total martial law or something and don't allow polls, that you'll have 70 to 80 percent of Americans on average believing the globalists carried out 9-11.
[00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:10.151]  Not that they had prior knowledge.
[00:42:10.491 --> 00:42:11.612]  Ooh, I'm a weirdo.
[00:42:11.712 --> 00:42:12.613]  Ooh, I'm a kook.
[00:42:13.607 --> 00:42:15.308]  You know, I think the government was behind 9-11.
[00:42:15.728 --> 00:42:17.288]  Well, I'm not a kook anymore, am I?
[00:42:17.708 --> 00:42:22.690]  As Mark Twain said, in the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated and feared and scorned.
[00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:29.252]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[00:42:31.912 --> 00:42:32.753]  More numbers.
[00:42:33.333 --> 00:42:39.054]  The country's broken up 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats and people that are registered as Republicans or Democrats.
[00:42:40.315 --> 00:42:40.735]  That is...
[00:42:41.819 --> 00:42:44.222]  The country's broken up in this fake left-right paradigm.
[00:42:44.682 --> 00:42:46.725]  But more people than there are Republicans.
[00:42:46.845 --> 00:42:48.386]  A majority of Republicans.
[00:42:48.407 --> 00:42:57.056]  56% of people that call themselves very conservative believe there might have been prior knowledge or involvement that there should be a new investigation.
[00:42:58.419 --> 00:43:03.101]  So to all the radio stations that carry this broadcast and go, man, we're carrying a really radical show.
[00:43:03.161 --> 00:43:06.603]  By the way, we're getting more affiliates because our message isn't so radical anymore.
[00:43:06.903 --> 00:43:09.404]  To all of you out there, you're doing a great job.
[00:43:09.424 --> 00:43:11.745]  To all the great sponsors out there, you're doing a great job.
[00:43:12.005 --> 00:43:13.045]  You're trailblazers.
[00:43:13.065 --> 00:43:14.266]  You've been there all along.
[00:43:14.566 --> 00:43:21.969]  And now, half of the people believe as we believe, know as we know, understand what we understand.
[00:43:22.189 --> 00:43:25.591]  And let me tell you, in a couple of years, it'll be almost everybody!
[00:43:28.112 --> 00:43:29.213]  And we're saving lives.
[00:43:29.393 --> 00:43:31.715]  The globals would have already carried out more terror attacks.
[00:43:31.735 --> 00:43:33.817]  They already planned more terror attacks after 9-11.
[00:43:33.897 --> 00:43:37.381]  But we exposed who was behind it and have backed them off.
[00:43:38.041 --> 00:43:39.843]  Does that mean they won't pull something off even bigger?
[00:43:40.592 --> 00:43:41.452]  No, it doesn't mean that.
[00:43:41.472 --> 00:43:42.393]  They probably will.
[00:43:42.633 --> 00:43:44.113]  But it's going to backfire on them.
[00:43:44.313 --> 00:43:57.258]  And I hope the eggheads, the people with 170 IQs running this, who listen to this show, those that are behind 9-11, I hope you face the facts, and I hope you tell your bosses in their ivory towers that you've lost control!
[00:43:57.498 --> 00:43:59.259]  You've awakened the sleeping giant!
[00:43:59.459 --> 00:44:00.999]  You've got a tiger by the tail!
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:06.521]  Let's talk to Keith in Georgia, then Mike in Florida and others.
[00:44:06.581 --> 00:44:07.882]  Keith, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:44:07.902 --> 00:44:08.262]  Go ahead.
[00:44:09.741 --> 00:44:11.082]  Let me pick up my phone here.
[00:44:11.122 --> 00:44:11.723]  I'm sorry.
[00:44:13.764 --> 00:44:14.485]  Can you hear me, Alex?
[00:44:14.505 --> 00:44:14.985]  Yes, I can.
[00:44:15.025 --> 00:44:15.366]  Go ahead.
[00:44:15.686 --> 00:44:17.347]  Forgive me for putting you on speakerphone.
[00:44:17.407 --> 00:44:17.667]  That's okay.
[00:44:17.687 --> 00:44:18.268]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:22.912]  I'd really like to bring up what you were talking about, these polls.
[00:44:23.472 --> 00:44:24.433]  Excellent, excellent.
[00:44:24.493 --> 00:44:26.214]  That causes me to worry.
[00:44:27.395 --> 00:44:30.217]  Because I've been into this for 30 years, Alex.
[00:44:30.257 --> 00:44:31.178]  I'm an old guy here.
[00:44:31.298 --> 00:44:34.481]  In 1975, I became aware of all of this.
[00:44:34.861 --> 00:44:38.224]  And it's a burden to carry it for that long, having this kind of information.
[00:44:38.686 --> 00:44:42.847]  But when I would talk about this in 1975, people would laugh at me.
[00:44:43.387 --> 00:44:47.028]  Today, I am commonly discussing it with my Georgia neighbors.
[00:44:47.868 --> 00:44:52.370]  Right-wing, very far right-wing Christians, and they're listening to it, and they're starting to believe it.
[00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:57.191]  This, to me, represents what could be disaster for us.
[00:44:57.251 --> 00:45:00.652]  I think it's too... They have too much control now.
[00:45:00.712 --> 00:45:03.333]  The technology is unfathomable.
[00:45:03.593 --> 00:45:04.553]  I've been in computers...
[00:45:05.812 --> 00:45:07.733]  My job left the country two years ago.
[00:45:07.773 --> 00:45:10.933]  I've been part-timing it here and there trying to make a living over this.
[00:45:11.693 --> 00:45:18.335]  But the same technology that you're using to disseminate the information, Alex, they're using to imprison us.
[00:45:18.775 --> 00:45:23.676]  Yeah, but people have learned to counter that and people have become conscious of that.
[00:45:24.176 --> 00:45:26.797]  And I don't know why you're upset that people are waking up.
[00:45:27.981 --> 00:45:38.088]  I'm glad they're waking up, but it makes me feel the government or the controlling entities are going to become desperate and move rapidly... Sir, that's why they carried out 9-11.
[00:45:38.288 --> 00:45:40.209]  Sir, they saw the trend that I saw.
[00:45:40.529 --> 00:45:41.470]  That's why they carried out 9-11.
[00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:41.870]  Absolutely.
[00:45:44.278 --> 00:45:53.045]  And their own PNAC document in 2000, and Brzezinski in 97, the Trilateral Commission chief, said the people are waking up to our global empire.
[00:45:53.065 --> 00:45:53.845]  They actually say this.
[00:45:54.946 --> 00:45:55.426]  Let me finish.
[00:45:55.627 --> 00:46:00.850]  They're not going to go along with our plans unless we have helpful terror attacks to mobilize them.
[00:46:01.311 --> 00:46:02.832]  Well, that's backfired on the globalists.
[00:46:03.579 --> 00:46:05.560]  Sir, we're winning the war.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.361]  Does that mean we'll win every battle?
[00:46:07.401 --> 00:46:08.842]  Does that mean things won't get worse?
[00:46:09.242 --> 00:46:10.703]  No, but we will never give up.
[00:46:10.743 --> 00:46:11.683]  We will never give in.
[00:46:11.904 --> 00:46:12.964]  We will never surrender.
[00:46:13.024 --> 00:46:14.045]  We will never falter.
[00:46:14.245 --> 00:46:17.186]  We will never waver, to use Schwarzenegger's Hitler comments.
[00:46:17.466 --> 00:46:18.687]  We're never backing off.
[00:46:19.428 --> 00:46:25.151]  Like my neighbor said to me the other day, though, he's got his job, he's raising his family, and he's working every day.
[00:46:25.191 --> 00:46:27.092]  He doesn't have a lot of time to keep up on this.
[00:46:27.112 --> 00:46:29.413]  A lot of my neighbors rely on me to try to fill them in.
[00:46:30.273 --> 00:46:31.894]  But they keep saying this to me.
[00:46:32.174 --> 00:46:32.874]  What do we do?
[00:46:32.954 --> 00:46:33.734]  What do you want me to do?
[00:46:33.794 --> 00:46:35.275]  Go out there with a gun and get killed?
[00:46:35.295 --> 00:46:37.196]  The local cops will be happy to shoot me down.
[00:46:37.216 --> 00:46:39.757]  Now, that's the crux of the problem, and I appreciate your call.
[00:46:39.817 --> 00:46:44.619]  That's the crux of the problem, is that most people I've talked to are awake.
[00:46:44.899 --> 00:46:49.061]  Again, black, white, old, young, Christian, conservative, liberal, libertarian.
[00:46:49.661 --> 00:46:52.542]  They're awake, but they say, what do we do?
[00:46:52.662 --> 00:46:53.202]  Save us.
[00:46:53.302 --> 00:46:54.143]  Where's the hero?
[00:46:54.203 --> 00:46:54.903]  Where's the leader?
[00:46:55.791 --> 00:46:59.532]  The New World Order wasn't built in a day, and it won't be destroyed and defeated in a day.
[00:46:59.612 --> 00:47:00.432]  It's a process.
[00:47:01.353 --> 00:47:02.013]  Okay?
[00:47:02.033 --> 00:47:07.895]  So stop looking for instant gratification, this instant gratification spectator society.
[00:47:08.415 --> 00:47:10.295]  Stop thinking it's going to happen overnight.
[00:47:11.136 --> 00:47:11.516]  Okay?
[00:47:11.916 --> 00:47:13.156]  We're in a fight, sir.
[00:47:13.536 --> 00:47:18.438]  A knockdown, drag out, sudden death, overtime, with the New World Order.
[00:47:19.318 --> 00:47:20.718]  And it's at the 50-yard line.
[00:47:21.019 --> 00:47:22.359]  We've got possession of the ball.
[00:47:23.266 --> 00:47:36.114]  And if you stop thinking about how big those guys are and how tough they are, and if you just gut up and hit hard and do your job and run the plays and cover your area, we're going to win!
[00:47:36.174 --> 00:47:37.255]  Do you understand me?
[00:47:37.275 --> 00:47:39.156]  Do you understand?
[00:47:39.436 --> 00:47:40.497]  We're taking it down.
[00:47:40.677 --> 00:47:42.138]  We're going to make a touchdown.
[00:47:42.518 --> 00:47:45.940]  Now get in there and hit them hard with the InfoWar!
[00:47:47.111 --> 00:47:47.931]  Mike in Florida.
[00:47:48.011 --> 00:47:48.812]  Mike, you're on the air.
[00:47:48.872 --> 00:47:49.372]  Go ahead.
[00:47:49.972 --> 00:47:51.793]  Oh, Alex, you're cracking me up, man.
[00:47:51.833 --> 00:47:52.673]  You're cracking me up.
[00:47:53.253 --> 00:47:55.654]  Alex, there are so many things I want to talk to you about.
[00:47:55.694 --> 00:48:02.756]  From the Pedophile Protection Act to be signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to Seibel Edmonds on 60 Minutes.
[00:48:03.477 --> 00:48:04.137]  The gamut.
[00:48:04.237 --> 00:48:05.417]  I could talk to you for hours.
[00:48:05.497 --> 00:48:07.858]  Yeah, let's talk about the Pedophile Protection Act.
[00:48:08.405 --> 00:48:09.125]  Makes me sick.
[00:48:10.246 --> 00:48:16.969]  Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger would appear is going to sign the Pedophile Protection, of course it's not called the Pedophile Protection Act.
[00:48:17.569 --> 00:48:18.770]  But I've read the bill.
[00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:25.393]  Look, the American Psychological Association four years ago said, this is normal, this is good, we should legalize it.
[00:48:25.593 --> 00:48:26.653]  They should be arrested.
[00:48:26.673 --> 00:48:28.534]  That is so sick.
[00:48:28.934 --> 00:48:35.877]  As you know, the Illuminati is full of pedophiles and homosexuals and Satanists, so this goes right in hand with their policy.
[00:48:36.478 --> 00:48:37.118]  That is true.
[00:48:37.887 --> 00:48:41.150]  Yeah, so I'm just really sick about that situation.
[00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:43.953]  Well, tell folks about the bill for those that aren't aware of it.
[00:48:45.455 --> 00:48:46.896]  Oh, about the pedophile protection?
[00:48:46.916 --> 00:48:47.637]  Yeah, tell them about it.
[00:48:47.657 --> 00:48:49.078]  It's posted on the website, by the way.
[00:48:49.139 --> 00:49:01.231]  Yeah, it's posted on the website, infoaward.com, and what it basically does is it gives the pedophiles certain protections that before they didn't have.
[00:49:02.305 --> 00:49:05.869]  If I'm not correct, I might be correct about that, Alex.
[00:49:05.889 --> 00:49:06.530]  You have to correct me.
[00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:07.270]  No, that's what it does.
[00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:08.411]  It gives them a bunch of rights.
[00:49:08.792 --> 00:49:10.914]  And, of course, pedophiles deserve no rights.
[00:49:10.934 --> 00:49:14.958]  They have the right to be hung by the neck until dead after a jury of their peers convicts them.
[00:49:15.318 --> 00:49:19.663]  Pedophiles deserve no rights, and what Governor Schwarzenegger is about to do
[00:49:20.347 --> 00:49:27.290]  It's to give these people certain protections so that they can go out and have sex with your children at school or wherever else.
[00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:28.490]  Well, that's the point, see.
[00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:32.892]  You know, first it's, you know, teach this stuff in the schools to kindergartners.
[00:49:33.252 --> 00:49:35.132]  Then it's, oh, bestiality's okay.
[00:49:35.152 --> 00:49:37.313]  Then it's, oh, pedophilia's okay.
[00:49:37.974 --> 00:49:40.094]  And in ten years, we're going to be the weirdos.
[00:49:40.374 --> 00:49:43.215]  We're going to be arrested as hate criminals because we're against it.
[00:49:44.136 --> 00:49:45.496]  I'm not joking, by the way.
[00:49:45.856 --> 00:49:46.677]  No, this is real.
[00:49:46.697 --> 00:49:47.357]  This is for sure.
[00:49:47.833 --> 00:49:50.214]  Did you see Sybil Edmonds on 60 Minutes?
[00:49:51.094 --> 00:49:57.335]  No, and for those who don't know who she is, she's the FBI translator ordered to falsify government prior knowledge documents on 9-11.
[00:49:57.435 --> 00:50:00.616]  I thought for sure, I thought for sure, oh, this is going to be good.
[00:50:00.636 --> 00:50:02.876]  I told all my friends, oh, this is going to be good.
[00:50:02.896 --> 00:50:05.437]  Sybil Edmonds is going to blow the whistle on 9-1-1.
[00:50:05.717 --> 00:50:07.397]  This whole thing is going to be exposed.
[00:50:07.537 --> 00:50:08.258]  Alex was right.
[00:50:09.198 --> 00:50:09.758]  Nothing happened.
[00:50:10.345 --> 00:50:11.366]  Well, that's because they edited it.
[00:50:11.406 --> 00:50:17.692]  We went and got one of her speeches on tape, and she was there in New York, and she gave a speech in Central Park, and she said, I'm not allowed to talk about it.
[00:50:18.012 --> 00:50:18.753]  I'll be arrested.
[00:50:19.554 --> 00:50:21.596]  It's just like FBI agent Robert Wright.
[00:50:21.616 --> 00:50:25.920]  I got him on video of Meet the Press going, all I can say is the Bushes' vacation with the Bin Ladens.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:26.560]  Here's the letter.
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:28.322]  I'll be arrested if I tell you what I know.
[00:50:28.342 --> 00:50:30.284]  Oh, that's great.
[00:50:30.524 --> 00:50:32.846]  How are we going to get the message out if everybody is silent?
[00:50:33.387 --> 00:50:34.528]  Well, we're not silent.
[00:50:34.688 --> 00:50:35.869]  We're not going to shut up, sir.
[00:50:37.183 --> 00:50:37.843]  I hope not, Alex.
[00:50:37.863 --> 00:50:38.223]  You're good.
[00:50:38.283 --> 00:50:41.784]  And by the way, I loved you on George Norris' show, Coast to Coast.
[00:50:41.804 --> 00:50:42.784]  You blew that show up.
[00:50:43.525 --> 00:50:45.705]  Well, email them and tell them to have me back on.
[00:50:45.945 --> 00:50:46.245]  Okay.
[00:50:46.325 --> 00:50:48.006]  Yeah, I want to come on there.
[00:50:48.026 --> 00:50:48.066]  Ah!
[00:50:49.826 --> 00:50:51.707]  I want to talk to 14 million people an hour.
[00:50:52.327 --> 00:50:54.467]  We'll be right back with more of your calls, more news.
[00:50:54.507 --> 00:50:55.107]  Stay with us.
[00:50:55.528 --> 00:50:56.508]  We're going to win this fight.
[00:50:56.628 --> 00:50:56.868]  Hood!
[00:50:56.948 --> 00:50:57.168]  Hood!
[00:50:57.268 --> 00:50:57.468]  Hood!
[00:51:01.986 --> 00:51:09.394]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:09.654 --> 00:51:14.379]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:20.266]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:20.486 --> 00:51:21.227]  We're good to go.
[00:51:45.609 --> 00:51:45.949]  That's 888-253-3139.

[00:52:17.534 --> 00:52:18.074]  We're good to go.
[00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:45.726]  The Berkey light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[00:54:03.810 --> 00:54:09.836]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:10.456 --> 00:54:13.419]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:24.910]  I do want to publicly acknowledge God for protecting us in New York, stopping the police from arresting us three separate times a day, threatening to...
[00:54:26.494 --> 00:54:32.440]  Our flight's being safely there, safely back, and I want to thank God for this radio show and the opportunity to fight the New World Order.
[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:36.263]  I want to thank the listeners, the sponsors, the affiliates, the folks running the broadcast.
[00:54:36.624 --> 00:54:48.435]  I want to thank Michael Corbin, who filled in Monday through Wednesday last week, and of course, Mr. Erskine did a great job Thursday and Friday, as well as Harry Brown joining us, and Paul Watson for his analysis joining us Monday through Friday last week.
[00:54:49.662 --> 00:54:54.284]  We'll go to Mike in Illinois, Simon in London, William in Oregon, and many others here.
[00:54:54.324 --> 00:55:05.809]  And then halfway in the next hour, I'm going to detail, in about 30 minutes, exactly what happened day by day, blow by blow, in New York, and why that's so important, because it's an example of the police state.
[00:55:06.129 --> 00:55:11.712]  Before I go back to your calls here, my new video, American Dictators, is out.
[00:55:12.492 --> 00:55:16.774]  By the way, I'm going to turn out a new one here in a couple months, too, about the convention, because it's about the police state.
[00:55:16.794 --> 00:55:18.335]  That film's going to be called Martial Law.
[00:55:18.896 --> 00:55:21.017]  But right now, American Dictators is out.
[00:55:21.077 --> 00:55:28.521]  It's about Bush and Kerry being cousins, the Skull and Bones connection, how they're really the same on their policies, the police state that's unfolding, the latest developments.
[00:55:28.901 --> 00:55:31.603]  We just finished this video a week and a half ago, okay?
[00:55:32.403 --> 00:55:33.404]  It's so up to date.
[00:55:34.301 --> 00:55:35.422]  And you need to order it.
[00:55:35.602 --> 00:55:40.244]  Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to get your copy of this 90-minute video.
[00:55:40.525 --> 00:55:40.645]  It's $19.95.
[00:55:41.165 --> 00:55:45.807]  My other videos are $25.95 because they're two and a half hours long.
[00:55:46.208 --> 00:55:47.668]  Some are two hours, 44 minutes long.
[00:55:47.688 --> 00:55:48.649]  But this one's a little bit shorter.
[00:55:48.669 --> 00:55:50.610]  90 minutes, a little bit more concise.
[00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:52.511]  American Dictators.
[00:55:52.551 --> 00:55:55.113]  And we ship it out to you UPS, folks.
[00:55:55.973 --> 00:56:01.316]  And the shipping's basically the same for three videos than it is for one, so I suggest you take advantage of that.
[00:56:02.092 --> 00:56:05.513]  UPS is a little bit more pricey, but it gets to you in three or four days after you order it.
[00:56:05.533 --> 00:56:09.375]  Unless something is in stock, and then that usually gets in a week or so.
[00:56:10.035 --> 00:56:11.755]  But almost everything is in stock right now.
[00:56:12.196 --> 00:56:13.416]  So again, give us a call.
[00:56:13.516 --> 00:56:14.616]  Order American Dictators.
[00:56:14.656 --> 00:56:15.457]  Get Road to Tyranny.
[00:56:15.477 --> 00:56:16.357]  Get Masters of Terror.
[00:56:16.677 --> 00:56:18.398]  Get Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:56:18.698 --> 00:56:19.798]  Get Matrix of Evil.
[00:56:20.158 --> 00:56:21.899]  Get George Humphrey's new video we carry.
[00:56:21.919 --> 00:56:23.279]  9-11, The Great Illusion.
[00:56:23.339 --> 00:56:24.360]  Endgame of the Illuminati.
[00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:24.440]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:31.596 --> 00:56:49.508]  That's 888-253-3139, or order via our safe, secure shopping carts at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com, or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:53.031]  Please get American Dictators.
[00:56:53.071 --> 00:56:54.812]  Get it on access television in your area.
[00:56:55.112 --> 00:56:57.894]  Show it to your VFW hall, your college students, your church.
[00:56:58.624 --> 00:57:06.467]  Your rabbi, you're going to show it at your synagogue, whatever, just get it out to people.
[00:57:06.487 --> 00:57:06.787]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:57:07.527 --> 00:57:09.628]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:57:09.688 --> 00:57:10.968]  Mike in Illinois, welcome.
[00:57:11.428 --> 00:57:12.189]  Alex, how you doing?
[00:57:12.289 --> 00:57:12.629]  Good, sir.
[00:57:12.869 --> 00:57:16.330]  Alex, I've got to thank you for going out there and covering that farce out there.
[00:57:16.350 --> 00:57:18.571]  It was total martial law.
[00:57:19.531 --> 00:57:20.932]  You know, Alex, I want to tell you something.
[00:57:20.952 --> 00:57:27.494]  I'm a Christian, and I know this church isn't based on God, but I know you believe in God, and we have freedom of religion and speech here, so you...
[00:57:28.243 --> 00:57:29.683]  Yeah, you let it all out here.
[00:57:29.723 --> 00:57:33.405]  And I just want to say, I go to church, I'm a Christian, and I'm going to tell you something.
[00:57:33.425 --> 00:57:35.425]  You know what Jesus Christ told his apostles?
[00:57:35.985 --> 00:57:38.726]  He told them to watch out for wolves in sheep's clothing.
[00:57:38.846 --> 00:57:53.771]  And all these people, and the majority of the people that go to my church, because I go to a small congregation of about 80 people and I talk to them, they all think that Bush is just the better of the two evils, and that because he's a Christian and prays before his meetings, that he's just the best one there is out there.
[00:57:53.791 --> 00:57:54.131]  And you know what?
[00:57:54.151 --> 00:57:55.071]  I'm going to tell you something, Alex.
[00:57:55.784 --> 00:58:00.302]  We're doomed with either one, and you know that and I know it, and your listeners know that.
[00:58:00.945 --> 00:58:03.866]  But, you know, the thing is, Alex, he's hiding behind God.
[00:58:04.206 --> 00:58:07.648]  And that's even more disgraceful because of his skull and bone background.
[00:58:07.908 --> 00:58:10.629]  Well, the devil masquerades as an angel of light.
[00:58:10.649 --> 00:58:11.609]  He quotes scripture.
[00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:12.510]  Absolutely.
[00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:13.770]  And the guy's skull and bones.
[00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:14.791]  He's Bohemian Grove.
[00:58:14.831 --> 00:58:16.011]  He's a cokehead.
[00:58:16.631 --> 00:58:17.312]  That's right, Alex.
[00:58:17.372 --> 00:58:19.693]  Now, I want to ask you, him and Carrie are what?
[00:58:19.753 --> 00:58:20.533]  Distant cousins?
[00:58:20.593 --> 00:58:21.614]  Second or third cousins?
[00:58:21.674 --> 00:58:24.755]  Third cousins, ninth cousins, and sixteenth cousins.
[00:58:26.856 --> 00:58:29.357]  Well, anyway... They're cousins in different areas of the family.
[00:58:29.657 --> 00:58:29.877]  Okay.
[00:58:30.922 --> 00:58:32.904]  Okay, Alex, you've got to go into a break here.
[00:58:32.944 --> 00:58:33.305]  Stay there.
[00:58:33.585 --> 00:58:33.825]  Okay.
[00:58:34.266 --> 00:58:38.972]  We'll start the second hour, let Mikey finish up, and we'll go to Simon, William, and others.
[00:58:40.093 --> 00:58:41.255]  Total free number to join us.
[00:58:41.975 --> 00:58:42.756]  On air, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:42.857 --> 00:58:47.843]  Get the new film, American Dictators.
[00:58:47.883 --> 00:58:49.245]  We're watching it at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:58:57.534 --> 00:58:58.175]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.855 --> 00:58:59.875]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.615 --> 00:59:01.715]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.355 --> 00:59:03.216]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.936 --> 00:59:04.796]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.516 --> 00:59:09.177]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.677 --> 00:59:13.838]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.378 --> 00:59:16.379]  All right, my friends.
[00:59:16.479 --> 00:59:18.419]  Seventh day of September 2004.
[00:59:18.479 --> 00:59:23.040]  We'll get more into the big Zogby poll last week.
[00:59:24.005 --> 00:59:28.309]  Half of the people in New York believe the government was involved in 9-11.
[00:59:28.329 --> 00:59:30.471]  60-plus percent believe they had prior knowledge.
[00:59:32.093 --> 00:59:33.514]  56% of conservatives think that.
[00:59:33.835 --> 00:59:34.735]  This is Zogby.
[00:59:34.776 --> 00:59:35.456]  We'll get into that.
[00:59:35.797 --> 00:59:40.721]  We'll get into my experiences in New York in a chronological, day-by-day order.
[00:59:40.801 --> 00:59:43.924]  We'll get into the tragic events in Russia.
[00:59:44.024 --> 00:59:46.487]  Also, seven Marines killed yesterday in Iraq.
[00:59:47.216 --> 00:59:54.060]  And, of course, your phone calls so much in this second hour and a bunch of new 9-11 developments.
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:55.501]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[00:59:55.841 --> 01:00:03.406]  Mike in Illinois, you were talking about your so-called Christian friends who think Bush is the lesser of two weevils or evils.
[01:00:04.106 --> 01:00:10.150]  And they don't understand he's skull and bones, Bohemian Grove, and that the devil masquerades as an angel of light.
[01:00:10.411 --> 01:00:12.492]  But if they just look at the facts, they'd see the evidence.
[01:00:12.572 --> 01:00:13.553]  I mean, look at Arnold.
[01:00:13.713 --> 01:00:20.578]  There's big government and anti-gun, pro-open border, pro-abortion as it gets, but the neocons cheer him and love him.
[01:00:20.938 --> 01:00:22.379]  This is how they suck people in.
[01:00:22.859 --> 01:00:23.560]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:25.301]  And I'm going to tell you something.
[01:00:25.661 --> 01:00:29.284]  I was looking at video clips of the... I was looking at video clips of the...
[01:00:30.507 --> 01:00:30.567]  In 1988.
[01:00:30.607 --> 01:00:34.709]  Yeah, and it's just so fitting that it would look like a Nazi helmet, isn't it, Alex?
[01:00:34.749 --> 01:00:35.969]  But here's what I want to ask you.
[01:00:50.242 --> 01:01:00.188]  You know, when you were out there, Alex, they weren't showing this, but there were tons of... In fact, some people I know have relatives that went there and said it was just utter chaos.
[01:01:00.288 --> 01:01:02.669]  And the news wasn't showing like it really was.
[01:01:02.689 --> 01:01:04.510]  The news said thousands of protests.
[01:01:04.550 --> 01:01:09.814]  Listen, I saw protests ten blocks long that were five streets wide, covering five different streets.
[01:01:10.254 --> 01:01:13.676]  There were just protests going on, dozens of them at any one time.
[01:01:14.556 --> 01:01:16.818]  All over the city, it was ultra-massive.
[01:01:17.299 --> 01:01:22.783]  The police would provocateur and run over people with mopeds, and then when the people would fight back, they'd just show that on the news.
[01:01:23.183 --> 01:01:27.246]  They had provocateurs out setting things on fire, you know, paper mache stuff on fire.
[01:01:27.506 --> 01:01:31.870]  Then the police would attack the peaceful crowds, and the anarchists would run off, and the police wouldn't arrest them.
[01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:34.911]  They had police out photographing myself and others.
[01:01:34.951 --> 01:01:37.873]  I was threatened with arrest three times a day, detained twice.
[01:01:37.913 --> 01:01:39.574]  It was a total police state.
[01:01:39.594 --> 01:01:40.294]  Thanks for the call.
[01:01:40.714 --> 01:01:42.295]  And I'll get into that later in this hour.
[01:01:42.875 --> 01:01:44.716]  Let's go to Simon in London.
[01:01:44.836 --> 01:01:45.737]  Simon, you're on the air.
[01:01:45.777 --> 01:01:46.097]  Welcome.
[01:01:48.629 --> 01:01:49.529]  Do we have Simon?
[01:01:49.889 --> 01:01:50.449]  Hi.
[01:01:50.769 --> 01:02:04.752]  With the Zogby poll, the suggestion of one of the 9-11 Truth activists, they sent around an email, you probably got it in your inbox, suggesting that lots of us email the results of the Zogby polls to various media organizations.
[01:02:05.272 --> 01:02:12.434]  Well, when I did that, I decided it would be interesting just to check the boxes for a reading receipt to see which media organizations
[01:02:12.918 --> 01:02:15.180]  So how many media institutions did you send the email to?
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.362]  They were just in the list.
[01:02:40.382 --> 01:02:44.988]  It was something I did quickly, but it was LA Times, New York Times, Fox News, CNN and others.
[01:02:45.008 --> 01:02:49.915]  But I'll tell you, a week after this poll came out, I haven't seen it in any U.S.
[01:02:49.975 --> 01:02:50.596]  newspaper.
[01:02:50.656 --> 01:02:52.359]  Zogby, the most respected...
[01:02:54.477 --> 01:02:55.378]  Just incredible.
[01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:58.661]  I mean, 56% of conservatives think there was prior knowledge.
[01:02:59.341 --> 01:03:01.723]  Half the people believe the government was involved.
[01:03:02.284 --> 01:03:10.271]  Well, I mean, the subject that I gave for the email, what they would have read in their inbox was my name, and then the subject being, New York doesn't believe the government's account of 9-11.
[01:03:10.351 --> 01:03:10.511]  And if...
[01:03:12.203 --> 01:03:24.215]  For the listeners who don't approach media companies like I do, and they don't approach their elected representatives like I do, because you have to see for yourself their complete lack of response to understand that it is a rigged game out there.
[01:03:24.235 --> 01:03:24.896]  Well, Simon, stay there.
[01:03:24.916 --> 01:03:25.897]  We'll talk to you on the other side.
[01:03:25.917 --> 01:03:26.117]  Look.
[01:03:27.242 --> 01:03:29.824]  You can forget emailing it to mainstream big TV.
[01:03:29.884 --> 01:03:43.094]  Where I'd send it is every local radio station, your pastor, your neighbor, your police chief, so they know that we're the majority, and they're going to be in a smaller and smaller minority, denying the world is round.
[01:03:43.515 --> 01:03:44.716]  The world is round.
[01:03:44.936 --> 01:03:45.997]  Government is tyranny.
[01:03:46.637 --> 01:03:48.358]  The globalists carried out 9-11.
[01:03:48.418 --> 01:03:49.439]  We are the majority.
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:50.940]  We're the normal people.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:51.461]  Stay with us.
[01:03:53.186 --> 01:03:56.007]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[01:03:56.127 --> 01:03:56.948]  Michael Trudeau here.
[01:03:57.088 --> 01:04:00.390]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:06.232]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[01:04:06.372 --> 01:04:09.394]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[01:04:09.654 --> 01:04:13.937]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[01:04:14.137 --> 01:04:16.039]  The chronic, everyday pain was miserable.
[01:04:16.159 --> 01:04:23.224]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again, with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[01:04:23.405 --> 01:04:25.906]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[01:04:26.187 --> 01:04:30.510]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice, only this time it changed my life.
[01:04:30.790 --> 01:04:34.633]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement, and after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[01:04:34.773 --> 01:04:40.138]  Well, that was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since, and today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[01:04:40.298 --> 01:04:40.838]  Side effects?
[01:04:40.998 --> 01:04:43.280]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:44.741]  Call Cuscott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[01:04:44.761 --> 01:04:44.962]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[01:04:45.002 --> 01:04:46.143]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[01:04:46.183 --> 01:04:46.943]  It worked for me.
[01:04:53.453 --> 01:04:54.114]  Hello, folks.
[01:04:54.214 --> 01:05:01.801]  Alex Jones here introducing Prudent Places USA, an interactive CD book that is your premier resource for hard-to-find information.

[01:05:44.695 --> 01:05:57.021]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:57.201 --> 01:06:01.644]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:01.764 --> 01:06:06.166]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:06:06.266 --> 01:06:07.527]  A New World Order.
[01:06:09.314 --> 01:06:13.535]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:13.595 --> 01:06:20.537]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:20.657 --> 01:06:22.717]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:23.037 --> 01:06:33.479]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:33.659 --> 01:06:36.220]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:36.720]  Big Brother.
[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:37.400]  Mainstream Media.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:01.841]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.502 --> 01:07:03.342]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.103 --> 01:07:05.024]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.444 --> 01:07:09.307]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.848 --> 01:07:13.951]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:14.171 --> 01:07:17.194]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:07:17.274 --> 01:07:18.775]  until 2 p.m.
[01:07:18.815 --> 01:07:21.037]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight.
[01:07:21.597 --> 01:07:24.319]  We're now 8 minutes and 30 seconds into the second hour.
[01:07:25.721 --> 01:07:28.343]  Coming up, I want to get more into this Zogby poll and also...
[01:07:29.249 --> 01:07:29.509]  Well, yeah.
[01:07:53.423 --> 01:08:18.773]  I was saying that it helps to reacquaint yourself with just how rigged the whole game is when you try every once in a while to just demonstrate to yourself that these guys aren't interested, that the game is rigged, and sending these emails out and getting a receipt back saying these emails were specifically not read, emails talking about the Zogby poll from Fox News, for example, is a good illustration for people, if they want to try it for themselves, check that box for the reading receipt and see who doesn't read your email.
[01:08:19.665 --> 01:08:23.326]  See if you get anything back that specifically says your message was not read.
[01:08:23.546 --> 01:08:31.869]  Now, in all fairness, they get, I would imagine, tens of thousands of emails a day and have trouble reading them, but they do have a bunch of interns and workers that do scan that.
[01:08:32.329 --> 01:08:35.930]  The real indicator is, is the mainstream media got this Zogby poll.
[01:08:36.090 --> 01:08:36.810]  Thanks for the call.
[01:08:59.739 --> 01:09:00.380]  I appreciate it.
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:06.604]  And since he mentions this, for folks that just joined us, let me go back over just a few paragraphs of this Zogby International poll.
[01:09:06.984 --> 01:09:11.087]  This is on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:09:11.347 --> 01:09:12.448]  Zogby International.
[01:09:13.068 --> 01:09:14.769]  Half of New Yorkers believe U.S.
[01:09:15.009 --> 01:09:20.133]  leaders had foreknowledge of impending 9-11 attacks and consciously...
[01:09:21.261 --> 01:09:22.542]  We're good to go.
[01:09:45.891 --> 01:09:58.435]  Overall, say that some of our leaders knew in advance that attacks were planned on or around September 11, 2001, and that they consciously failed to act according to the poll conducted by Zogby International.
[01:09:58.976 --> 01:10:04.758]  The poll of New York residents was conducted from Tuesday, August 24, through Thursday, August 26, 2004.
[01:10:05.498 --> 01:10:09.839]  Overall results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 plus or minus.
[01:10:12.412 --> 01:10:15.055]  The poll is the first of its kind conducted in America.
[01:10:15.455 --> 01:10:19.179]  The survey attributes attitudes regarding U.S.
[01:10:19.419 --> 01:10:21.481]  government complicity in the 9-11 tragedy.
[01:10:21.521 --> 01:10:33.733]  Despite this acute legal and political implications of this accusation, nearly 30% of registered Republicans and 38% of those who describe themselves as very conservative supported the claim of government involvement or prior knowledge.
[01:10:35.349 --> 01:10:39.831]  The change found very high support among adults.
[01:10:40.471 --> 01:10:43.993]  The charge found very high support among adults under 30, 62.8%.
[01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:47.614]  I believe the government was involved or had prior knowledge.
[01:10:48.014 --> 01:10:48.815]  African Americans, 62.5%.
[01:10:48.855 --> 01:10:49.115]  Hispanics, 60.1%.
[01:10:49.155 --> 01:10:49.315]  Asians, 59.4%.
[01:10:49.395 --> 01:10:52.396]  And self-described born-again evangelical Christians, 47.9%.
[01:10:52.436 --> 01:10:54.497]  I believe the government consciously let it happen.
[01:11:02.245 --> 01:11:24.251]  Less than 2 in 5, 36%, believe that the 9-11 Commission had answered all the important questions about what actually happened on September 11th, and 2 in 3, 2 out of 3, 66% New Yorkers, and 56.2% overall, fold for another full investigation of the still unanswered questions by Congress or Eliot Spitzer's New York's Attorney General.
[01:11:24.791 --> 01:11:30.393]  Self-identified, very liberal New Yorkers supported a new inquiry by a margin of 3 to 1.
[01:11:31.753 --> 01:11:35.915]  But so did 53% of very conservative citizens across the state.
[01:11:36.656 --> 01:11:44.900]  The call for a deeper probe was especially strong from Hispanics, 75.6%, African Americans, 75.3%, citizens with income from $15,000 to $25,000 a year at 74.3%, women overall, 62%, and evangelicals at 59.9%, calling for another investigation.
[01:11:57.415 --> 01:12:00.016]  And it goes on and on and on and on.
[01:12:00.036 --> 01:12:01.056]  We'll cover more of it later.
[01:12:01.516 --> 01:12:03.776]  Right now, let's go to William in Oregon.
[01:12:03.816 --> 01:12:05.357]  William, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:12:06.237 --> 01:12:07.477]  Alex, I've got a couple things.
[01:12:07.557 --> 01:12:09.278]  First of all, you were great in New York.
[01:12:09.338 --> 01:12:11.778]  I want to thank you on behalf of everybody that appreciates you.
[01:12:11.978 --> 01:12:15.399]  C-SPAN, that was a treat to see you on C-SPAN.
[01:12:16.199 --> 01:12:21.000]  In terms of the Zogby poll and informing the planet, I think there's a site out there called 911truthout.org perhaps.
[01:12:24.048 --> 01:12:33.474]  Evidently, there's going to be a big meeting on September 11th where a lot of these questions are going to be exposed in New York and are going to hopefully get some more awareness out there.
[01:12:33.514 --> 01:12:34.875]  Maybe the media will grab it.
[01:12:35.415 --> 01:12:43.860]  Another thing I want to say is I went to a site on Information Clearinghouse about a DVD that's out called In Plain Sight.
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:44.981]  E-L-A-N-E.
[01:12:45.481 --> 01:12:46.041]  Incredible.
[01:12:46.201 --> 01:12:47.002]  Really well done.
[01:12:47.242 --> 01:12:48.083]  Just like Humphreys.
[01:12:49.083 --> 01:12:49.684]  Very well done.
[01:12:49.784 --> 01:12:53.506]  But the reason why I called you was last week a very disturbing thing happened where I live.
[01:12:56.263 --> 01:12:58.524]  Somebody I know met somebody through the Internet, blah, blah, blah.
[01:12:58.544 --> 01:12:59.525]  I'll make a long story short.
[01:12:59.545 --> 01:13:01.106]  I was introduced to this gentleman named Howard.
[01:13:01.987 --> 01:13:03.628]  Howard works, and we started talking.
[01:13:03.668 --> 01:13:07.792]  I started going off on my little tirade about life and things and the planet.
[01:13:09.033 --> 01:13:11.074]  And come to find out, Howard works for Boeing.
[01:13:11.094 --> 01:13:13.336]  And that got me going.
[01:13:13.836 --> 01:13:16.338]  And then he's in an RFID program with Boeing.
[01:13:16.398 --> 01:13:21.042]  Now, mind you, Howard had a little bit of champagne under his gut and taking this for what it's worth.
[01:13:21.102 --> 01:13:22.183]  But in talking to Howard...
[01:13:23.274 --> 01:13:25.635]  He's very anti-Muslim.
[01:13:26.016 --> 01:13:27.236]  He just assumed kill them all.
[01:13:27.396 --> 01:13:29.377]  And he's in charge of a program, allegedly.
[01:13:29.397 --> 01:13:35.021]  If anybody can help out with any information on this or know anything about the program to back it up, I'd appreciate it.
[01:13:35.941 --> 01:13:44.786]  But he wants to go to Saudi Arabia because the Saudi Arabians are concerned that the population is going to rise up against them and take out their monarchy, their tatership.
[01:13:45.652 --> 01:13:54.517]  And they want Boeing to come in there and inject as many people as they can, probably the whole population, and have complete takeover of the populace to keep their monarchy in check.
[01:13:55.137 --> 01:13:58.679]  And I was really disturbed by... I want Boeing to come in and inject them with what?
[01:13:59.379 --> 01:14:00.300]  With RFIDs.
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:03.702]  Like, take the whole population of Saudi Arabia.
[01:14:03.722 --> 01:14:06.003]  This is what this Howard guy's telling me, and he was dead straight.
[01:14:06.043 --> 01:14:07.124]  I can't help but believe him.
[01:14:08.836 --> 01:14:10.257]  I had to grill him over and over.
[01:14:10.297 --> 01:14:11.078]  I go, are you serious?
[01:14:11.138 --> 01:14:12.419]  And he had this gleam in his eye.
[01:14:12.599 --> 01:14:13.399]  It scared me.
[01:14:13.559 --> 01:14:15.681]  I thought he was like 58 years old and a scientist.
[01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:18.042]  He's 47, but he's aged not too well.
[01:14:18.843 --> 01:14:23.286]  But anyways, his indication to me was that Boeing, he's part of this project.
[01:14:23.446 --> 01:14:26.207]  He's going to be going to Kansas and to Texas and over to Saudi Arabia.
[01:14:26.247 --> 01:14:28.449]  That's his flight or his travel plans at this point.
[01:14:29.477 --> 01:14:32.958]  I met him through a mutual friend, and I just was livid by the end of the evening.
[01:14:32.979 --> 01:14:36.620]  I only could last about 25 minutes with this guy, and I had to get out before I did something.
[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:41.742]  So he was saying that Boeing is going to administer a forced inoculation program?
[01:14:41.962 --> 01:14:43.783]  Well, yeah, correct, for the Saudis.
[01:14:43.803 --> 01:14:44.944]  They're going to be contracted out.
[01:14:44.984 --> 01:14:45.404]  I looked at him.
[01:14:45.444 --> 01:14:47.064]  I said, Howard, are you doing this for the money?
[01:14:47.084 --> 01:14:49.665]  He goes, yeah, I'm paid really well, but I'll pay you right now.
[01:14:49.685 --> 01:14:51.646]  I want to take out as many Muslims as I can.
[01:14:51.666 --> 01:14:55.348]  I mean, I thought I was talking to a KKK guy, but it's just the same mentality.
[01:14:55.388 --> 01:14:55.608]  I just...
[01:14:56.383 --> 01:14:58.925]  I've never met anybody up front and personal and close like that.
[01:14:58.945 --> 01:15:04.029]  It was like talking to Mengele or Oppenheimer or somebody that was just creating some huge problem for the future of this world.
[01:15:04.909 --> 01:15:05.550]  And he was right there.
[01:15:05.570 --> 01:15:11.354]  And he said they're preparing for the monarchy to forcibly inoculate with tracker chips the Saudi Arabian population.
[01:15:11.594 --> 01:15:12.194]  Exactly.
[01:15:12.254 --> 01:15:13.976]  And my computer just went down.
[01:15:14.016 --> 01:15:19.920]  I was trying to do an RFID search on human control to find out all the capabilities in RFIDs.
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:21.341]  And I imagine there are like so many things.
[01:15:21.421 --> 01:15:22.542]  It could be innumerable.
[01:15:23.237 --> 01:15:23.817]  I hear you.
[01:15:23.877 --> 01:15:25.558]  You ought to write an article about that.
[01:15:25.618 --> 01:15:31.321]  You ought to send it to me at tips at infowars.com or to the email address that's on Prison Planet.
[01:15:31.361 --> 01:15:33.283]  When we post that, thanks for the call.
[01:15:34.323 --> 01:15:35.384]  Good to hear from you.
[01:15:36.444 --> 01:15:37.865]  I appreciate the call, William.
[01:15:37.985 --> 01:15:41.387]  Since you mentioned that and a lot of folks are laughing at it, let me just go back.
[01:15:42.651 --> 01:15:50.662]  About six, seven years ago, I started getting government documents about plans to inject the population with tiny RFID tracker chips.
[01:15:50.702 --> 01:15:54.167]  Tex Mars in 1995 wrote a book called Project Lucid.
[01:15:54.187 --> 01:15:55.468]  He got the actual documents.
[01:15:56.530 --> 01:15:56.990]  He wrote it in 1995.
[01:15:57.091 --> 01:16:00.075]  It was published in 1996 when nobody even heard of RFID.
[01:16:01.937 --> 01:16:07.560]  About six months ago, I interviewed the big European distributor for Verichip.
[01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:08.180]  Remember that interview?
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:09.581]  We have a transcript of it on the website.
[01:16:10.001 --> 01:16:13.183]  And he said, yeah, the Italian government's about to make all their government people take it.
[01:16:13.223 --> 01:16:14.424]  Other governments are about to do it.
[01:16:14.444 --> 01:16:17.165]  You're going to have to have this as the world ID chip.
[01:16:17.586 --> 01:16:18.966]  It'll be injected into you.
[01:16:21.027 --> 01:16:21.908]  He went on and on.
[01:16:23.649 --> 01:16:25.410]  And he said, the chip will prevail.
[01:16:25.450 --> 01:16:26.550]  That's like a new slogan.
[01:16:26.570 --> 01:16:27.771]  He said, the chip will prevail.
[01:16:27.831 --> 01:16:28.671]  Get chip today.
[01:16:28.691 --> 01:16:31.173]  They have these chip trucks that drive around the U.S.
[01:16:31.213 --> 01:16:31.313]  now.
[01:16:31.914 --> 01:16:33.575]  They have contracts to put them in prisoners.
[01:16:33.595 --> 01:16:34.355]  That's from Reuters.
[01:16:35.135 --> 01:16:39.097]  And then, what, two months ago, 160, then it was 300, now it's even more.
[01:16:39.577 --> 01:16:43.758]  If you want to work at the Justice Department building in Mexico City, you've got to have a chip to get in the building.
[01:16:44.159 --> 01:16:45.319]  The door is automatically open.
[01:16:45.339 --> 01:16:46.620]  You've just got to have it for security.
[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:48.320]  That is forced, folks.
[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:50.001]  Well, if you want to go to work, you've got to have the chip.
[01:16:51.681 --> 01:16:55.243]  And now they're talking about making police take it in their hands so only their gun works.
[01:16:55.263 --> 01:16:56.683]  Well, you don't have to work here.
[01:16:56.883 --> 01:16:57.744]  We're not forcing you.
[01:16:57.764 --> 01:16:58.384]  Just take the chip.
[01:16:59.449 --> 01:17:03.590]  And now they've got this forced inoculation plan that they want to put through here in the U.S.
[01:17:03.610 --> 01:17:06.190]  It's in page 76 of the Homeland Security Package that passed.
[01:17:07.070 --> 01:17:10.271]  They just came out with RFIDs that are spray-on to the skin.
[01:17:10.831 --> 01:17:12.752]  That was on Fox News last night.
[01:17:13.992 --> 01:17:15.732]  At about 1 in the morning, I saw it.
[01:17:16.852 --> 01:17:17.612]  This is the system.
[01:17:18.093 --> 01:17:19.113]  And it sounds crazy.
[01:17:19.173 --> 01:17:20.193]  It sounds out of control.
[01:17:20.273 --> 01:17:21.293]  It sounds unbelievable.
[01:17:21.873 --> 01:17:23.434]  But this is the truth.
[01:17:24.394 --> 01:17:25.674]  This is the reality.
[01:17:26.693 --> 01:17:28.114]  And they really are doing it.
[01:17:28.254 --> 01:17:32.915]  I mean, I never thought I'd go to New York City and be told I couldn't videotape anywhere in the city even with press passes.
[01:17:33.835 --> 01:17:35.436]  I never thought there'd be security blimps.
[01:17:35.456 --> 01:17:38.057]  I never thought there'd be helicopters everywhere looking through our walls.
[01:17:38.877 --> 01:17:39.937]  But this is the new America.
[01:17:39.977 --> 01:17:40.858]  This is the new globe.
[01:17:42.638 --> 01:17:53.782]  I never thought a guy that said he loved Hitler and loved Kirk of all time and hates black people publicly said it could be the governor and be called conservative because he's pro-abortion, anti-gun.
[01:17:55.220 --> 01:18:00.463]  Anti-border and to watch Republicans scream like it was the second coming of the Fuhrer in Germany.
[01:18:01.024 --> 01:18:04.286]  I mean, just I was there in the hall with Schwarzenegger as the worship began.
[01:18:04.766 --> 01:18:05.606]  Intense worship.
[01:18:06.927 --> 01:18:07.668]  Intense worship.
[01:18:08.368 --> 01:18:10.549]  Universal screaming and yelling and worshiping.
[01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:13.191]  This is your new conservatism.
[01:18:14.212 --> 01:18:15.312]  More liberal than Bill Clinton?
[01:18:15.332 --> 01:18:15.733]  You love it.
[01:18:16.753 --> 01:18:17.854]  If you want to call it liberal.
[01:18:18.674 --> 01:18:19.915]  So we're here, folks.
[01:18:19.955 --> 01:18:24.578]  And after the globalists nuke a city or release smallpox, they're going to forcibly inject every one of us with a chip.
[01:18:25.495 --> 01:18:27.777]  And they'll say, well, to leave your house or have a job, you've got to have it.
[01:18:28.197 --> 01:18:30.579]  And the Christian churches are going to say, it's the mark of Jesus.
[01:18:31.039 --> 01:18:32.140]  I'm not being sarcastic here.
[01:18:32.701 --> 01:18:35.042]  They're already on TV saying it's not bad, go ahead and take it.
[01:18:35.823 --> 01:18:36.704]  And so laugh at me.
[01:18:36.744 --> 01:18:43.269]  When it happens, just be ready to say no to it, or I guess say that it's the mark that you follow the new world leader who's joined us.
[01:18:44.230 --> 01:18:45.030]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:45.070 --> 01:18:49.834]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are using Revelation as a roadmap, a program.
[01:18:49.854 --> 01:18:50.935]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:56.481]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:18:56.541 --> 01:19:00.722]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:19:00.962 --> 01:19:03.763]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:19:03.943 --> 01:19:06.343]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:19:06.543 --> 01:19:15.186]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:19:15.366 --> 01:19:16.726]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:19:16.926 --> 01:19:21.067]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:19:21.067 --> 01:19:21.727]  We're good to go.
[01:19:51.067 --> 01:19:51.567]  We're good to go.
[01:19:51.587 --> 01:19:52.928]  We're good to go.
[01:20:15.706 --> 01:20:16.106]  We're good to go.
[01:20:34.975 --> 01:20:38.356]  For the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[01:20:38.676 --> 01:20:41.176]  As good as gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:20:41.196 --> 01:20:47.598]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[01:20:47.738 --> 01:20:49.098]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[01:20:49.218 --> 01:20:55.059]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:55.820 --> 01:21:01.441]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[01:21:01.481 --> 01:21:02.221]  Supreme Court.
[01:21:03.007 --> 01:21:07.291]  Yet on February 29th, 1892, in an eye-nothing decision of the U.S.
[01:21:07.351 --> 01:21:10.954]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[01:21:11.955 --> 01:21:17.219]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:26.287]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:27.869 --> 01:21:29.610]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-
[01:21:31.408 --> 01:21:32.089]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:32.129 --> 01:21:32.829]  Call now.
[01:21:32.849 --> 01:21:39.915]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:52.699 --> 01:21:54.161]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:21:54.381 --> 01:22:01.709]  Jerry Guidetti from the ARC Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:22:02.030 --> 01:22:06.455]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the ARC Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:22:06.715 --> 01:22:09.018]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato tastes.
[01:22:09.258 --> 01:22:16.560]  Big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:20.962]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[01:22:21.302 --> 01:22:23.803]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[01:22:24.103 --> 01:22:29.965]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:22:30.265 --> 01:22:31.906]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:22:32.086 --> 01:22:32.986]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:22:33.066 --> 01:22:36.047]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[01:22:36.207 --> 01:22:39.828]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[01:22:40.068 --> 01:22:42.029]  That's 800-255-1912.
[01:22:42.829 --> 01:22:46.891]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[01:22:47.031 --> 01:22:47.951]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:22:57.845 --> 01:22:59.766]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:23:00.246 --> 01:23:04.827]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:04.847 --> 01:23:05.587]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:23:05.607 --> 01:23:06.328]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:23:06.348 --> 01:23:13.530]  More of your calls coming up.
[01:23:14.430 --> 01:23:19.412]  Coming up in the next segment, we'll still go to your calls, but I want to start getting into what happened in New York and spend some time on that.
[01:23:21.392 --> 01:23:25.854]  But two years ago, on this date, I remember on February 6th,
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:30.541]  7th, we released Road to Tyranny.
[01:23:32.582 --> 01:23:41.566]  And then in early September, September 7th, for some reason that date keeps popping up, we released Masters of Terror.
[01:23:42.267 --> 01:23:43.867]  Two films really back-to-back.
[01:23:43.907 --> 01:23:45.048]  My two 9-11 films.
[01:23:46.008 --> 01:23:49.430]  And in that, we get into the stand-down order of NORAD.
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:57.788]  Using several different drills, but one major drill, simulating flying hijacked jets into New York and D.C.
[01:23:57.828 --> 01:23:58.468]  landmarks.
[01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:03.673]  And we had learned this independently before it was in the news from our sources.
[01:24:04.234 --> 01:24:06.336]  Later, it did come out in the Associated Press.
[01:24:07.257 --> 01:24:08.838]  Well, here's the headline today.
[01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:13.783]  And this is, Rupert blows the lid off 9-11 and new book.
[01:24:15.962 --> 01:24:21.245]  And I'm glad that he's reporting on this and has even dug up some other stuff.
[01:24:22.285 --> 01:24:29.108]  But, again, a lot of people have been doing a good job out there of exposing this, but this is a central thing to cover, and I'm glad he's covering it.
[01:24:31.549 --> 01:24:36.652]  And in this little write-up it says, and, again, this is very, very important.
[01:24:37.777 --> 01:24:54.252]  As Mike Rupert will delineate in his upcoming book, Crossing the Rubicon, and Crossing the Rubicon is where Caesar went ahead and illegally brought his legions into Rome and set up the real dictatorship, which is now happening here with the globalists, the Homeland Security and the Patriot Act.
[01:24:54.872 --> 01:25:01.338]  As Rupert will delineate in his upcoming book, Crossing the Rubicon, there were at least five training exercises in progress on the morning of 9-11-2001.
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:10.663]  Each and every one, and any others we may not know of yet, was under the control of Vice President Dick Cheney.
[01:25:10.703 --> 01:25:13.764]  Now that even came out about two years ago in ABC News.
[01:25:13.844 --> 01:25:22.867]  Dick Cheney was in Site R, there on the Maryland-DC border, from that bunker, and he was in control of NORAD.
[01:25:22.907 --> 01:25:24.348]  He was in control of the exercises.
[01:25:24.608 --> 01:25:25.688]  That is documented.
[01:25:26.008 --> 01:25:32.571]  They've declared national security on those tapes, and it won't let us know what Dick Cheney was actually doing.
[01:25:33.948 --> 01:25:45.593]  Number one, military exercise northern vigilance transferred most of the combat-ready interceptors and possibly many AWACS from the northern east into northern Canada and Alaska.
[01:25:45.633 --> 01:25:50.515]  This explains in part why there were only eight combat interceptors in the northeast on 9-11.
[01:25:50.955 --> 01:26:01.160]  Number two, non-military bio-warfare exercise tripod two, which, by the way, a few months ago in the 9-11 commission meetings, Rudolph Giuliani finally admitted to.
[01:26:01.949 --> 01:26:12.059]  FEMA arrived in New York City on September 10, 2001, to set up a command post for FEMA, New York City, and Department of Justice on Manhattan's Pier 29.
[01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:14.542]  This shows our masters are loving.
[01:26:14.862 --> 01:26:17.645]  They made a strong effort to minimize the required deaths.
[01:26:17.926 --> 01:26:23.131]  This was probably forced on them by the CFR nice guys who must occasionally kill innocent people.
[01:26:24.033 --> 01:26:27.474]  Number three, war game exercise, Vigilant Guardian.
[01:26:27.834 --> 01:26:31.776]  This exercise simulated hijacked planes in the Northeast sector.
[01:26:31.796 --> 01:26:36.777]  The 9-11 Commission made only mention of this single exercise and lied about its purpose.
[01:26:37.178 --> 01:26:40.179]  The Commission said its purpose was to intercept Russian bombers.
[01:26:40.759 --> 01:26:46.301]  The CIA's own website said it was simulations of hijacked jets or jets gone awry flying into buildings.
[01:26:46.821 --> 01:26:49.462]  Number four, war game exercise, Vigilant Warrior.
[01:26:49.882 --> 01:26:53.003]  This exercise simulated hijacked planes in the Northeast sector.
[01:26:54.113 --> 01:26:56.314]  A war game exercise in Northern Guardian.
[01:26:56.334 --> 01:26:59.174]  This exercise simulated hijacked planes in the Northeast sector.
[01:26:59.875 --> 01:27:05.956]  At the time of the real hijacking, there were as many as 22 hijacked aircraft on NORAS radar screen.
[01:27:06.496 --> 01:27:15.139]  Some of these drills were live fly exercises where actual aircraft, likely flown by remote control, were simulating hijacked aircraft.
[01:27:15.199 --> 01:27:19.340]  Some of the drills electronically added the hijacked aircraft into the system.
[01:27:20.186 --> 01:27:22.567]  All this as the real hijackings began.
[01:27:22.987 --> 01:27:29.429]  NORAD could not tell the difference between the 17 bogus blips and the five actual hijacked aircraft blips.
[01:27:29.829 --> 01:27:30.589]  Cheney could.
[01:27:31.389 --> 01:27:35.230]  It is clear we know almost nothing about how 9-11 was executed.
[01:27:35.590 --> 01:27:44.813]  We should know it was an exceedingly high technological operation involving dozens of major projects, each employing large resources.
[01:27:45.753 --> 01:27:49.334]  That's from RENT's website, from a KITCOM website.
[01:27:50.848 --> 01:27:53.429]  And so, very, very interesting.
[01:27:53.609 --> 01:27:57.971]  And I was aware of those five exercises.
[01:27:57.991 --> 01:28:10.076]  I was aware of four of them and had written about them and put it, of course, in a film I put out two years ago and also covered it in Police State's Retotal Enslavement that I put out a year ago.
[01:28:11.017 --> 01:28:18.620]  And in the new film, American Dictators, that came out a week and a half ago, we also cover that because it is so important
[01:28:19.102 --> 01:28:25.566]  They were running drills of flying hijacked jets into buildings on the morning of 9-11 in the exact same area.
[01:28:26.126 --> 01:28:27.787]  That's how NORAD stood down.
[01:28:28.167 --> 01:28:30.388]  And Dick Cheney was in control of that.
[01:28:31.289 --> 01:28:34.250]  But they will not release details under national security.
[01:28:35.391 --> 01:28:37.072]  It is a big, big deal.
[01:28:37.652 --> 01:28:40.034]  All right, we'll come back and get into more news in your call.
[01:28:40.074 --> 01:28:40.514]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.445 --> 01:28:44.366]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.826 --> 01:28:46.467]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.367 --> 01:28:50.129]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.251 --> 01:28:54.752]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:28:54.932 --> 01:28:56.073]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:28:56.253 --> 01:28:59.675]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:28:59.775 --> 01:29:07.600]  Phenol, ingestion of even small amounts, may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:12.043]  PTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:29:12.143 --> 01:29:12.584]  Fragrance?
[01:29:12.964 --> 01:29:17.728]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:29:17.868 --> 01:29:22.552]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[01:29:22.772 --> 01:29:25.315]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[01:29:25.595 --> 01:29:28.998]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:29:29.158 --> 01:29:32.661]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[01:29:32.881 --> 01:29:35.262]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[01:29:35.402 --> 01:29:36.303]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:29:36.403 --> 01:29:46.148]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.

[01:29:53.334 --> 01:29:59.578]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:29:59.718 --> 01:30:05.881]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:30:06.162 --> 01:30:14.587]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:30:14.847 --> 01:30:21.871]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:30:22.171 --> 01:30:26.994]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:30:27.214 --> 01:30:32.618]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:30:32.958 --> 01:30:36.040]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:30:36.361 --> 01:30:44.346]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:44.366 --> 01:30:44.946]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:54.033 --> 01:30:57.956]  Ladies, for healthier, more radiant skin and hair, you need to start flipping it.
[01:30:58.257 --> 01:30:58.997]  Do you flip it?
[01:30:59.418 --> 01:31:01.740]  When I first started flipping it, I couldn't believe my eyes.
[01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:04.282]  Once you start flipping it, you'll never stop.
[01:31:04.810 --> 01:31:09.792]  For more natural approach to looking and feeling great, visit naturalskinandhair.com or call their friendly and knowledgeable staff toll free at 1-866-339-SKIN.
[01:31:28.524 --> 01:31:28.764]  I think.
[01:32:00.015 --> 01:32:04.018]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[01:32:04.739 --> 01:32:09.923]  We'll get to Johnny and Matt and Wayne and Darren and Jimmy and everybody else here in a few minutes.
[01:32:09.983 --> 01:32:12.905]  I want to get into what happened in New York kind of in a chronological order.
[01:32:14.826 --> 01:32:16.507]  And there's so much other news I want to cover.
[01:32:16.548 --> 01:32:20.350]  But we're getting a bunch of requests to one more time air myself on C-SPAN.
[01:32:20.771 --> 01:32:22.532]  We're inside the security perimeter.
[01:32:23.613 --> 01:32:26.515]  C-SPAN wouldn't go out where the protesters were at, but I had press passes.
[01:32:27.205 --> 01:32:36.393]  They had delegates lined up telling us how great the New World Order is, and so they wouldn't let me speak at first, and I talked to them later, and they went ahead and gave me about 45 seconds.
[01:32:36.994 --> 01:32:42.158]  This is what I had to say right after Cheney got done giving a speech on national television.
[01:32:42.438 --> 01:32:45.041]  You can watch the video of this at prisonplanet.com.
[01:32:45.081 --> 01:32:45.501]  Here it is.
[01:32:46.122 --> 01:32:49.985]  Go back outside of Madison Square Garden for more delegate reaction.
[01:32:50.683 --> 01:32:55.784]  And Susan, of course, the floor is empty, but they're here, and we'd be accused of not hearing all voices.
[01:32:55.824 --> 01:32:57.144]  We cut you off a moment ago.
[01:32:57.204 --> 01:32:59.885]  This is Alex Jones from Austin, Texas, the radio talk show host.
[01:33:00.025 --> 01:33:00.385]  Yes, sir.
[01:33:00.405 --> 01:33:03.106]  With InfoWars.com, both candidates are cousins.
[01:33:03.146 --> 01:33:04.006]  They're skull and bones.
[01:33:04.226 --> 01:33:05.726]  They're bringing in big government and tyranny.
[01:33:05.946 --> 01:33:06.666]  The evidence is clear.
[01:33:06.686 --> 01:33:10.027]  The military-industrial complex was intimately involved in 9-11.
[01:33:10.207 --> 01:33:11.967]  The commission is a complete fraud.
[01:33:12.187 --> 01:33:13.268]  We're losing our freedoms.
[01:33:13.348 --> 01:33:14.408]  Both parties are controlled.
[01:33:14.628 --> 01:33:18.289]  And if we don't wake up and stand up and speak out, this country's going to be destroyed.
[01:33:18.349 --> 01:33:20.289]  Giving up liberty only gives us tyranny.
[01:33:20.709 --> 01:33:28.913]  It does not give us security, and I hope that everybody out there wakes up to this and realizes that America is America because we have the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:33:29.134 --> 01:33:32.255]  Everybody should investigate 9-11 and find out who's really behind it.
[01:33:32.475 --> 01:33:37.018]  It's Bush's and the New World Order's Reichstag, and his cousin Kerry isn't going to save you either.
[01:33:37.198 --> 01:33:38.719]  Thank you, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:33:39.219 --> 01:33:40.400]  Alex Jones, okay now.
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:42.341]  I love it.
[01:33:42.801 --> 01:33:44.862]  Here's what I'm going to do, because I don't want everybody holding forever.
[01:33:44.882 --> 01:33:46.263]  I'm going to give each one of you 60 seconds.
[01:33:47.324 --> 01:33:48.565]  That'll take six, seven minutes.
[01:33:49.205 --> 01:33:50.947]  And those have been holding the longest.
[01:33:50.967 --> 01:33:53.729]  Then I'm going to get into my trip in New York the rest of the hour.
[01:33:53.749 --> 01:33:57.852]  Then I'll come back and get into Russia, what's happening in Iraq, and some of the new police state stuff.
[01:33:58.152 --> 01:33:59.713]  But Johnny in Texas, you're up next.
[01:33:59.733 --> 01:34:00.153]  Go ahead.
[01:34:00.774 --> 01:34:01.374]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:34:01.414 --> 01:34:02.295]  Thanks for everything you do.
[01:34:02.335 --> 01:34:02.995]  We appreciate it.
[01:34:03.055 --> 01:34:03.436]  Thank you.
[01:34:03.576 --> 01:34:04.997]  This is from the Associated Press.
[01:34:05.978 --> 01:34:06.718]  A new Bushism.
[01:34:06.858 --> 01:34:13.023]  We need to do something about these frivolous lawsuits that are running up the cost of your health care and running good docs out of business.
[01:34:13.503 --> 01:34:14.624]  We've got an issue in America.
[01:34:15.017 --> 01:34:16.799]  Too many good docs are getting out of business.
[01:34:17.139 --> 01:34:22.924]  Too many OBGYNs aren't able to practice their love with women all across this country.
[01:34:23.444 --> 01:34:26.587]  I've got this post at mastersofterror.net for those that want to read it.
[01:34:26.767 --> 01:34:27.368]  Isn't that something?
[01:34:28.289 --> 01:34:29.910]  When did Lord Bush say that?
[01:34:30.450 --> 01:34:37.797]  This was two hours and 47 minutes ago in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, to a crowd of 16,500 people.
[01:34:39.887 --> 01:34:40.707]  All right, my friend.
[01:34:40.747 --> 01:34:41.428]  Thanks for the call.
[01:34:41.488 --> 01:34:42.148]  Very interesting.
[01:34:42.188 --> 01:34:42.788]  Thanks for holding.
[01:34:43.068 --> 01:34:53.312]  Hey, Stephanie, that brings up some of the Bush-isms a few weeks ago and Kerry-isms, where Kerry said we're going to double our terror forces, and Bush says we're doing all we can to attack the American people.
[01:34:53.892 --> 01:34:54.572]  Bush said that.
[01:34:55.012 --> 01:34:56.993]  Can you play the clip that's got them both back-to-back?
[01:34:58.917 --> 01:35:00.819]  I'll take another call, then we'll play that clip.
[01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:02.882]  Let's talk to Matt in Texas.
[01:35:03.642 --> 01:35:04.543]  Matt, you're on the air.
[01:35:04.583 --> 01:35:05.224]  Go ahead, Matt.
[01:35:05.665 --> 01:35:10.790]  Alex, did you see the Dennis Miller show that had George H. Bush on it during the convention?
[01:35:11.371 --> 01:35:11.872]  No, I didn't.
[01:35:12.272 --> 01:35:18.299]  He actually said that Hitler was a wonderful fellow in a lot of ways, and he had a good side.
[01:35:18.937 --> 01:35:21.018]  And I have it queued up right now if you want to hear it.
[01:35:21.298 --> 01:35:26.640]  I'm begging you to send me that immediately and put a note in there that you get a free video.
[01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:30.162]  I'm begging you to mail me that immediately.
[01:35:30.222 --> 01:35:32.543]  Again, their family made their money off the Nazis.
[01:35:32.563 --> 01:35:34.023]  They love Arnold, who's a Nazi.
[01:35:34.344 --> 01:35:37.565]  Yeah, go ahead and put the phone right up to the microphone.
[01:35:37.585 --> 01:35:38.365]  All right, here it is.
[01:35:40.346 --> 01:35:40.786]  Here it is.
[01:35:42.207 --> 01:35:42.747]  Lord Bush.
[01:35:43.167 --> 01:35:43.707]  Herbert Walker.
[01:35:46.869 --> 01:35:47.329]  Can't hear it.
[01:35:51.007 --> 01:35:51.688]  Okay, sir.
[01:35:51.988 --> 01:35:52.548]  Did you hear that?
[01:35:52.668 --> 01:35:55.109]  No, you have to turn the TV way up.
[01:35:55.569 --> 01:35:57.070]  You've got to put the phone right up to it.
[01:35:57.870 --> 01:35:58.170]  All right.
[01:35:58.251 --> 01:35:59.091]  Couldn't hear any of it.
[01:35:59.791 --> 01:36:00.812]  Do you have it cued back up?
[01:36:01.332 --> 01:36:01.552]  Yes.
[01:36:01.572 --> 01:36:03.633]  Here it is.
[01:36:03.893 --> 01:36:08.475]  Okay, go ahead and play it.
[01:36:08.855 --> 01:36:11.396]  Dennis, you've got to be more politically correct.
[01:36:11.416 --> 01:36:13.037]  There's a good side to Adolf.
[01:36:13.117 --> 01:36:13.918]  He liked dogs.
[01:36:13.958 --> 01:36:15.678]  He was a wonderful fellow in a lot of ways.
[01:36:15.698 --> 01:36:16.939]  You've got to be fair now.
[01:36:17.637 --> 01:36:18.478]  Did you hear that?
[01:36:18.998 --> 01:36:20.039]  Yeah, I think Bush Sr.
[01:36:20.079 --> 01:36:21.580]  was being sarcastic there.
[01:36:22.221 --> 01:36:34.390]  Yeah, well, what they were talking about was his service during the war and how, you know, after you get back from the war, you're basically, the stories get out of control.
[01:36:34.470 --> 01:36:40.295]  And they were kind of joking that, you know, Dennis was like, yeah, I heard that you shot Hitler in the back of the head or something.
[01:36:40.922 --> 01:36:44.464]  And then he went on to say that Hitler was a wonderful fellow in a lot of ways.
[01:36:44.545 --> 01:36:45.685]  Yeah, Bush Sr.
[01:36:46.166 --> 01:36:48.547]  No, that was Kennedy, not Hitler.
[01:36:50.328 --> 01:36:53.110]  That Bush had a hand in getting rid of Bush Sr.
[01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:53.571]  Right.
[01:36:53.791 --> 01:36:54.651]  No, no, Bush Sr.
[01:36:54.691 --> 01:36:57.333]  was in Japan or in the Pacific Theater.
[01:36:57.353 --> 01:36:59.054]  He was not in the European Theater.
[01:36:59.074 --> 01:36:59.715]  That's what he said.
[01:36:59.735 --> 01:37:01.256]  He said, yeah, from long distance.
[01:37:02.174 --> 01:37:03.675]  Oh, from long distance.
[01:37:03.936 --> 01:37:04.476]  You know, it's funny.
[01:37:04.496 --> 01:37:09.340]  Dennis Miller, this vicious liberal, this big socialist, now is a Bush lover.
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:11.482]  It's like Zell Miller and the rest of them.
[01:37:12.002 --> 01:37:19.168]  Yeah, it's kind of like they live where the, you know, you've said this before, where the guys are underground and they're like, oh, it's great that you're on our side now.
[01:37:19.228 --> 01:37:26.274]  The one guy that they used to know and he's wearing a tux and everything in the underground bunker and
[01:37:28.544 --> 01:37:29.004]  I hear you.
[01:37:29.164 --> 01:37:30.204]  Still mail me that video.
[01:37:30.225 --> 01:37:31.105]  I appreciate the call.
[01:37:31.425 --> 01:37:32.005]  Okay.
[01:37:32.125 --> 01:37:34.926]  Go ahead, Stephanie, and did you find those clips?
[01:37:36.526 --> 01:37:37.847]  You can't find it in the folder?
[01:37:39.227 --> 01:37:40.627]  Well, we just played it a few weeks ago.
[01:37:40.647 --> 01:37:41.548]  It didn't get erased, did it?
[01:37:44.188 --> 01:37:45.289]  She'll find it, folks.
[01:37:45.329 --> 01:37:45.969]  She's good at that.
[01:37:46.009 --> 01:37:47.309]  We have hundreds of clips in there.
[01:37:48.129 --> 01:37:50.070]  It's the Bushisms clips.
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:51.300]  Can't miss them.
[01:37:52.081 --> 01:37:54.442]  Let's go ahead and go to Wayne.
[01:37:54.462 --> 01:37:56.423]  Wayne, where are you calling us from?
[01:37:56.543 --> 01:37:58.343]  Lansing, Kansas, right next to Leavenworth.
[01:37:58.684 --> 01:37:59.084]  Welcome.
[01:37:59.424 --> 01:38:02.465]  Hey, first I'm going to ask a question and I'm going to risk being real stupid.
[01:38:02.605 --> 01:38:03.706]  I have not heard you before.
[01:38:03.766 --> 01:38:04.346]  Where have you been?
[01:38:04.366 --> 01:38:06.027]  Have you been on the same station?
[01:38:06.807 --> 01:38:08.208]  What station are you listening to this time?
[01:38:08.228 --> 01:38:13.890]  I'm listening to, it looks like, please pardon my stupidity, but it looks like 11-something.
[01:38:14.230 --> 01:38:15.531]  I'm near Kansas City.
[01:38:16.235 --> 01:38:19.798]  Yeah, we're on KCXL in Kansas City for about four years.
[01:38:20.518 --> 01:38:23.020]  I'm sorry, I don't know why I picked you up.
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:24.581]  I'm going to start listing you today.
[01:38:25.482 --> 01:38:26.002]  Here's the deal.
[01:38:26.642 --> 01:38:33.207]  All this stuff about Bush and the royal family and oil and Colin Powell being out there in the left field somewhere.
[01:38:35.669 --> 01:38:36.910]  What is this relationship?
[01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:43.914]  I mean, I think there's a relationship there between Bush and the royal family in Saudi Arabia and Osama bin Laden.
[01:38:44.415 --> 01:38:44.615]  Bruce?
[01:38:45.695 --> 01:38:52.737]  We have hundreds of articles, mainstream, posted on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, in the 9-11 archives.
[01:38:52.797 --> 01:38:57.419]  They have been in business with the Bin Ladens for at least, what, 29 years.
[01:38:57.699 --> 01:39:02.060]  Yeah, I mean, I cannot figure out, why doesn't somebody get on this force and ride it?
[01:39:02.321 --> 01:39:06.462]  Well, it comes out here and there in the mainstream media, but never becomes the big nightly news item.
[01:39:06.782 --> 01:39:10.503]  They flew the Bin Ladens out, 161 of them, and all their air traffic was grounded.
[01:39:10.523 --> 01:39:12.564]  I mean, this to me is treasonous.
[01:39:13.248 --> 01:39:16.609]  The Bin Ladens were used to fight the Soviets in the 80s.
[01:39:16.649 --> 01:39:19.191]  The Bin Ladens were used to attack the Serbs in the late 90s.
[01:39:19.531 --> 01:39:20.911]  Senate report by Republicans.
[01:39:21.812 --> 01:39:25.913]  In 1918, the Bin Ladens became the main British intelligence arm in Saudi Arabia.
[01:39:26.133 --> 01:39:27.474]  They've always been servants.
[01:39:27.834 --> 01:39:28.755]  That's their job.
[01:39:29.295 --> 01:39:30.976]  What has happened to Colin Powell?
[01:39:30.996 --> 01:39:31.896]  You think he just quit?
[01:39:32.481 --> 01:39:34.622]  Colin Powell plays the part of the good cop.
[01:39:34.642 --> 01:39:38.524]  He comes out against the war, and on the eve of the war says, I was wrong, I'm for it.
[01:39:38.884 --> 01:39:44.787]  Colin Powell is part of the fake left-right paradigm within the State Department on our nightly news.
[01:39:45.067 --> 01:39:47.028]  And Colin Powell is related to the Bushes.
[01:39:47.068 --> 01:39:48.369]  That's even been in the mainstream media.
[01:39:49.469 --> 01:39:52.991]  They're all related to the Queen of England.
[01:39:53.011 --> 01:39:54.031]  They're related to Kerry.
[01:39:54.752 --> 01:39:55.812]  It's all a broad line.
[01:39:56.252 --> 01:39:57.073]  Well, well.
[01:39:57.753 --> 01:39:59.834]  Hey, pardon my stupidity for not finding you earlier.
[01:39:59.894 --> 01:40:01.515]  I'm going to listen to you every day.
[01:40:02.031 --> 01:40:03.152]  Well, sir, you're not stupid.
[01:40:03.172 --> 01:40:05.533]  People have just spread the word in Kansas City, which they've been doing.
[01:40:05.713 --> 01:40:06.154]  Will do.
[01:40:06.654 --> 01:40:07.735]  All right, thank you for the call.
[01:40:07.775 --> 01:40:08.235]  Thank you.
[01:40:08.635 --> 01:40:09.376]  I appreciate it.
[01:40:10.256 --> 01:40:15.480]  Let us go ahead now and take one more call, then I've got to get to New York, and then we'll get to other calls later.
[01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:17.341]  Darren in Colorado, go ahead.
[01:40:17.361 --> 01:40:18.101]  Hi, Alex.
[01:40:18.361 --> 01:40:19.522]  A couple things.
[01:40:19.983 --> 01:40:31.330]  The first one is Lucid Technologies, before their stocks dropped, a friend's brother's best friend was helping to package six billion digital angels.
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:35.903]  Right prior, a couple years ago, for their stock.
[01:40:36.123 --> 01:40:42.849]  Well, sir, Digital Angel is a product of Applied Digital Solutions based in Florida.
[01:40:43.469 --> 01:40:46.131]  And Lucent is Bell Labs.
[01:40:47.132 --> 01:40:48.093]  But go ahead.
[01:40:48.393 --> 01:40:58.642]  But anyway, what I wanted to get to also is that I wanted to explain how the Constitution can work against this, if you're not careful.
[01:40:59.590 --> 01:41:00.351]  I don't understand you.
[01:41:00.371 --> 01:41:01.632]  Well, let me try to make it clear.
[01:41:29.022 --> 01:41:30.363]  Okay?
[01:41:30.783 --> 01:41:40.630]  When you rise up to challenge authority, it's the police officers, the soldiers who agree with you who would be sent against that assembly wherever it might form.
[01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:54.779]  And so if you use the constitutional way of rising up, then if somebody actually attacks the government, the justly, against the good and the bad, then it unifies the government.
[01:41:54.799 --> 01:41:55.339]  Okay, I hear you.
[01:41:55.439 --> 01:41:56.980]  Thank you for the call, sir.
[01:41:57.501 --> 01:41:57.741]  Look...
[01:41:59.170 --> 01:42:05.672]  The police swear an oath to protect and defend and uphold the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[01:42:06.132 --> 01:42:07.672]  They're citizens just like us.
[01:42:07.692 --> 01:42:09.592]  They're not separate from us.
[01:42:10.133 --> 01:42:11.953]  The government's tried to put that in their heads.
[01:42:12.413 --> 01:42:19.095]  When they help carry out unlawful orders and dismantle America, they're destroying their future, their family's future.
[01:42:19.635 --> 01:42:27.157]  And a lot of police I talk to in New York individually are against what's happening, but in group think, they follow those unlawful orders.
[01:42:28.257 --> 01:42:28.597]  Okay?
[01:42:29.421 --> 01:42:32.203]  And so it's like saying a German soldier isn't bad.
[01:42:32.603 --> 01:42:33.884]  You know, he's just an individual.
[01:42:33.924 --> 01:42:36.646]  Well, he is bad when he follows the orders of Hitler.
[01:42:37.647 --> 01:42:38.928]  So that's what's happening here.
[01:42:39.848 --> 01:42:42.470]  We need people in government to follow their oath.
[01:42:42.530 --> 01:42:43.611]  That's why they have an oath.
[01:42:44.271 --> 01:42:46.113]  That's why they should know what the Bill of Rights is.
[01:42:46.273 --> 01:42:47.774]  It's just that simple.
[01:42:50.075 --> 01:42:58.381]  Talking about New York, I've never experienced such patented classical textbook
[01:42:59.406 --> 01:43:04.050]  By the book, Full Bore Martial Law.
[01:43:05.511 --> 01:43:09.635]  There was no law against videotaping, but I saw them arresting, smashing cameras.
[01:43:10.456 --> 01:43:17.402]  It came out on our last day in New York, but News 1 in New York got a copy of the memo to the police from before the convention started.
[01:43:18.052 --> 01:43:24.036]  About how to be mean to independent media, how to identify independent media, how to help mainstream media.
[01:43:24.397 --> 01:43:26.878]  And then I experienced that persecution.
[01:43:27.058 --> 01:43:29.320]  I experienced that oppression.
[01:43:29.901 --> 01:43:31.402]  I experienced that bullying.
[01:43:32.382 --> 01:43:33.823]  We got there Saturday night.
[01:43:34.504 --> 01:43:39.367]  I went out, went around videotaping all over the town, walked down into the subway, was videotaping.
[01:43:39.407 --> 01:43:41.689]  A woman began screaming from behind the ticket counter.
[01:43:42.378 --> 01:43:43.159]  Turn that off!
[01:43:43.199 --> 01:43:44.339]  That could be a terrorist!
[01:43:44.399 --> 01:43:45.260]  Oh my gosh!
[01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:45.940]  Turn it off!
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.021]  I'm calling the police!
[01:43:47.521 --> 01:43:48.502]  Oh, you're so evil!
[01:43:48.522 --> 01:43:55.406]  Then we get on the subway, we get out at Grand Central Station, start videotaping, have police come over and threaten to arrest us.
[01:43:55.786 --> 01:43:56.847]  We have press passes.
[01:43:56.867 --> 01:43:57.868]  I say, why are you taping?
[01:43:57.988 --> 01:44:05.773]  Because, sir, this place has supposedly been a target, and we're covering how that terror alert that was put out turned out to be four years old and was fake.
[01:44:06.693 --> 01:44:07.874]  Then we went out onto the street.
[01:44:08.533 --> 01:44:10.455]  And interviewed cab drivers and citizens.
[01:44:10.515 --> 01:44:14.778]  Almost every one of them believed the government was behind 9-11, now mirrored by the Zogby poll.
[01:44:14.798 --> 01:44:17.040]  Then we went to bed.
[01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:20.883]  We got up the next day and were part of a protest of 300,000 people.
[01:44:21.564 --> 01:44:33.393]  Plus, the media said it was a couple thousand, even though there were photos all over the New York papers from up above the building showing five streets wide, ten blocks long, every street jam-packed with over 300,000 people.
[01:44:36.561 --> 01:44:40.028]  Then I got word that up at the head of one of the marches, Michael Moore was up there.
[01:44:40.088 --> 01:44:46.040]  We sped in a cab around the five streets that were filled, ran up, when he saw us he ran into a
[01:44:48.163 --> 01:44:50.164]  Big old taco place.
[01:44:50.484 --> 01:44:52.726]  They had everybody thrown out of the taco place.
[01:44:53.086 --> 01:44:58.449]  I put the camera up to the window and videotaped through it way back in the back as he was shoveling food in his mouth.
[01:44:58.929 --> 01:45:02.111]  And his bodyguards came up and started shoving me, telling me not to videotape him.
[01:45:02.391 --> 01:45:04.212]  I told them it was the First Amendment, back off.
[01:45:04.292 --> 01:45:06.233]  One of them shoved me, I bumped right back into him.
[01:45:06.554 --> 01:45:07.434]  Then he backed off.
[01:45:08.194 --> 01:45:09.435]  Just like all tyrants do.
[01:45:09.455 --> 01:45:12.437]  So here's Moore who claims he's out fighting tyranny.
[01:45:13.072 --> 01:45:20.014]  And then he's out dealing with tyranny, and then he's out confronting people and chasing them around, and oh look, the elite throws people out of restaurants and has bodyguards.
[01:45:20.334 --> 01:45:22.854]  Now he's become what he supposedly hates and has fought against.
[01:45:23.474 --> 01:45:26.855]  Then Moore comes out, his bodyguards push everybody out of the way, ram into me.
[01:45:27.235 --> 01:45:28.495]  I ram right back into him.
[01:45:28.535 --> 01:45:30.896]  I ask him why he didn't talk about NORAD scanning now.
[01:45:31.216 --> 01:45:34.057]  Why he didn't talk about the drills on 9-11 of hijacked jets.
[01:45:34.497 --> 01:45:35.697]  Why his film didn't do that.
[01:45:36.417 --> 01:45:40.778]  Then the police came out to protect him, took him down a street that was closed, and he got in a waiting car.
[01:45:41.676 --> 01:45:49.385]  Then I went out and talked to some communists and said, well, don't you know that communism was created by the big banks to calm the serfs back into slavery?
[01:45:49.705 --> 01:45:51.448]  Don't you know Stalin killed 50 million people?
[01:45:51.488 --> 01:45:54.091]  And their answer was, too bad Stalin didn't kill you!
[01:45:55.735 --> 01:45:58.577]  Then I continued to videotape the blimp following the crowds around.
[01:45:58.598 --> 01:46:01.420]  You could always tell what the biggest protest was because the blimp was above it.
[01:46:01.740 --> 01:46:06.424]  A Fuji blimp sponsoring the NYPD with NYPD on it, surveilling us.
[01:46:06.964 --> 01:46:13.489]  Then I was behind the Madison Square Garden Convention Center, and all of a sudden David Gergen comes walking down the street getting out of a limo.
[01:46:14.090 --> 01:46:16.732]  Advisor to George Herbert Walker Bush and Bill Clinton.
[01:46:17.916 --> 01:46:20.697]  I run up to David Gergen and I say, hello, sir, will you talk to us?
[01:46:20.717 --> 01:46:21.297]  He said, sure.
[01:46:21.357 --> 01:46:24.198]  I said, I'm the guy that snuck into Bohemian Grove.
[01:46:24.798 --> 01:46:31.020]  In a 96 article in the Washington Times, you said you don't run around in the woods naked like the other members when it was brought up.
[01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:33.220]  He said, well, I'm not going to talk about that.
[01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:34.541]  I said, well, I'm the guy that snuck in.
[01:46:34.581 --> 01:46:35.581]  He said, how dare you?
[01:46:35.621 --> 01:46:36.481]  You trespassed.
[01:46:37.481 --> 01:46:38.342]  I'm not going to talk to you.
[01:46:38.362 --> 01:46:42.183]  And he got in my face and started cussing at me and poking me with his finger.
[01:46:42.223 --> 01:46:42.963]  He's a big old guy.
[01:46:43.855 --> 01:46:46.937]  And then I said, well, tell us about the rituals.
[01:46:46.957 --> 01:46:48.318]  And he said, none of your bleeping business.
[01:46:48.358 --> 01:46:49.479]  And I said, do you take part of them?
[01:46:49.879 --> 01:46:50.460]  Take part of them.
[01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:52.141]  He said, no, I'm not going to talk to you about it.
[01:46:52.441 --> 01:46:53.782]  I'm not going to talk about the rituals.
[01:46:55.183 --> 01:46:56.424]  So it's riveting video.
[01:46:56.444 --> 01:46:57.704]  It'll be in an upcoming film.
[01:46:58.264 --> 01:47:00.465]  And those were the two confrontations that day.
[01:47:01.146 --> 01:47:03.587]  And then I went to Central Park.
[01:47:03.647 --> 01:47:05.548]  It was videotaping a huge protest.
[01:47:05.928 --> 01:47:08.509]  Mayor Bloomberg had said no protest allowed there.
[01:47:09.089 --> 01:47:09.950]  No First Amendment.
[01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:11.730]  He said marching there would be a privilege.
[01:47:11.770 --> 01:47:13.231]  The First Amendment now a privilege.
[01:47:13.591 --> 01:47:17.193]  They've had protests and demonstrations there for over 100 years in Central Park.
[01:47:17.593 --> 01:47:19.054]  Suddenly that wasn't allowed.
[01:47:19.554 --> 01:47:22.315]  But tens of thousands of people just ignored the edict.
[01:47:23.473 --> 01:47:31.623]  Now we found out why we weren't allowed to protest there because down the street in Central Park at, quote, the Yacht Club on the little lake there, Dick Cheney was having a fundraiser.
[01:47:34.347 --> 01:47:38.512]  We were sitting there on the grass cooling off because it was about 95 degrees there in New York.
[01:47:39.150 --> 01:47:45.493]  And all of a sudden, a woman's behind us taking pictures of us, and it was Candace Bergen, of all people, you know, Murphy Brown.
[01:47:45.533 --> 01:47:46.753]  We talked to her about the New World Order.
[01:47:46.773 --> 01:47:47.614]  She wouldn't talk about it.
[01:47:47.994 --> 01:47:49.375]  That was something interesting that happened.
[01:47:49.835 --> 01:47:52.196]  Then I went out into the big crowd, was interviewing people.
[01:47:52.736 --> 01:47:57.398]  I talked to hundreds of people there alone who were aware of the New World Order and were listeners of this radio show.
[01:47:57.478 --> 01:47:58.358]  Blew me away.
[01:47:59.579 --> 01:48:02.240]  Then all of a sudden, we saw the communists again, and they wouldn't talk to us.
[01:48:02.260 --> 01:48:03.861]  They said, you can only talk to our leader.
[01:48:04.540 --> 01:48:08.543]  Then they started putting on their bandanas and stuff and threatening us that they were going to come after us.
[01:48:08.983 --> 01:48:13.887]  I stood there and joked and said, in this corner Alex Jones, in the other corner scrawny communist.
[01:48:15.048 --> 01:48:15.988]  And that went on and on.
[01:48:16.008 --> 01:48:22.153]  And then we went out and covered protests that night and confronted other people and got video of people being arrested and provocateurs.
[01:48:22.233 --> 01:48:29.458]  And the police rode a bunch of mopeds into a crowd of protesters who had a permanent demonstration by Madison Square Garden.
[01:48:30.706 --> 01:48:35.668]  The local news showed them running people over with mopeds and people jumping back up and punching the police back.
[01:48:36.068 --> 01:48:40.410]  But on national news, which we got on tape, they just said people randomly attacked the police.
[01:48:40.490 --> 01:48:43.391]  So another example of total media distortion.
[01:48:44.652 --> 01:48:46.993]  And that's only part of what happened on day one.
[01:48:47.013 --> 01:48:51.095]  When we get back, we'll take another call from Jimmy in Texas.
[01:48:51.975 --> 01:48:55.016]  I'll plug my videos, so get ready for that number to how to order those.
[01:48:55.036 --> 01:48:58.898]  Then we'll come back the third hour and I'll tell you about day two, day three.
[01:48:59.688 --> 01:49:00.388]  And day four.
[01:49:00.569 --> 01:49:02.029]  And in the end, day five.
[01:49:03.330 --> 01:49:06.932]  So we'll get into that when we return.
[01:49:08.733 --> 01:49:14.796]  I'm sitting here with so much information, so many news articles, so many things I want to cover, so many documents I want to go over.
[01:49:16.337 --> 01:49:20.520]  Oh, this whole Moscow, or whole Russian situation stinks to high heaven.
[01:49:22.361 --> 01:49:29.546]  The Zogby Poll, where half of New Yorkers who the government carried out 9-11, 60-plus percent think they had prior knowledge and let it happen.
[01:49:30.547 --> 01:49:36.031]  Just so much I want to cover, but we've got an hour and eight minutes left, so please stay with us.
[01:49:36.091 --> 01:49:37.092]  PrisonPlanet.tv, folks.
[01:49:37.452 --> 01:49:40.674]  You can watch my new film there for 15 cents a day.
[01:49:40.694 --> 01:49:44.177]  The new film, American Dictators, at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:49:44.237 --> 01:49:44.797]  We'll be back.
[01:49:45.197 --> 01:49:45.838]  Stay with us.
[01:49:53.132 --> 01:49:54.633]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:54.813 --> 01:49:57.896]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.036 --> 01:50:01.938]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:01.978 --> 01:50:06.222]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:50:06.562 --> 01:50:10.344]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:10.485 --> 01:50:12.286]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:12.526 --> 01:50:15.768]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[01:50:15.808 --> 01:50:20.531]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:20.691 --> 01:50:23.733]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:23.914 --> 01:50:26.775]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.276 --> 01:50:33.380]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:36.021]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139

[01:53:09.042 --> 01:53:09.903]  We're here, my friends.
[01:53:09.943 --> 01:53:11.084]  Whole third hour coming up.
[01:53:11.124 --> 01:53:11.845]  I won't get into...
[01:53:12.651 --> 01:53:17.614]  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, what happened in New York, what I witnessed, some of the key things.
[01:53:18.114 --> 01:53:36.225]  Putting 2,000 people in a camp, putting tape over their mouths when they were arrested, putting people in handcuffs up to 24 hours, just massive abuse, randomly arresting tourists, children, old people, doctors, lawyers, American spectator writers, conservative writers.
[01:53:36.686 --> 01:53:37.566]  It was just random.
[01:53:37.606 --> 01:53:39.307]  And by the grace of God, we were not arrested.
[01:53:39.787 --> 01:53:42.249]  We were threatened with arrest three separate times a day.
[01:53:43.801 --> 01:53:51.768]  On Tuesday night, we went out on a jet boat around Manhattan, got stopped and had M60 machine guns pointed at us twice.
[01:53:52.829 --> 01:53:55.791]  I'll tell you about all of it after we take some calls.
[01:53:55.831 --> 01:53:59.414]  I've got to get into this Russian news and a whole stack of stuff here.
[01:53:59.434 --> 01:54:00.395]  It's just so much to cover.
[01:54:02.205 --> 01:54:10.712]  But before I do that, I do want to encourage every single one of you out there that's listening to get my new film, American Dictators.
[01:54:10.792 --> 01:54:16.958]  It gets into the staged election of 2004, Bush and Kerry being cousins, the tale Skull and Bones.
[01:54:17.018 --> 01:54:19.340]  We revisit and go back to Bohemian Grove.
[01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:21.381]  Oh yeah, I didn't tell you about that.
[01:54:22.692 --> 01:54:23.532]  You want to see this.
[01:54:24.053 --> 01:54:30.055]  Then we get into how the police state's unfolding and just all the different facets of what a dictatorship is.
[01:54:30.555 --> 01:54:36.758]  So American Dictators, 90 minutes long, 1995, InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:54:37.798 --> 01:54:41.680]  There's my two 9-11 films, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny and The Masters of Terror.
[01:54:42.429 --> 01:54:43.489]  We're good to go.
[01:54:43.509 --> 01:54:44.350]  We're good to go.
[01:55:01.558 --> 01:55:09.871]  So go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order via the SafeSecure shopping cart, or call right now to order via the operators at 1-888-253-3139.
[01:55:15.692 --> 01:55:16.972]  That's 888-253-3139.

[01:55:28.076 --> 01:55:32.377]  And if you haven't taken action, please take action now and expose the murdering globalists.
[01:55:32.917 --> 01:55:33.837]  Look at the polls.
[01:55:33.937 --> 01:55:35.798]  Half the people think the government did it now.
[01:55:36.633 --> 01:55:37.894]  Major Zogby poll.
[01:55:37.914 --> 01:55:39.314]  We've got to push that up higher.
[01:55:39.334 --> 01:55:41.415]  We're going to stop them from killing more people.
[01:55:41.475 --> 01:55:46.357]  If we don't, they're going to keep doing it.
[01:55:46.377 --> 01:55:46.957]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:55:47.137 --> 01:55:54.980]  Or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:55:55.881 --> 01:55:56.301]  All right.
[01:55:57.221 --> 01:55:59.682]  Let's talk to Jimmy in Texas, and we'll go to break.
[01:55:59.702 --> 01:56:02.163]  Dr. Ron, Robert, and others.
[01:56:02.223 --> 01:56:02.924]  Go ahead, Jimmy.
[01:56:03.324 --> 01:56:03.784]  Good afternoon.
[01:56:04.338 --> 01:56:04.558]  Hello.
[01:56:04.578 --> 01:56:12.325]  Alex, first of all, it was great to see you online outside the RNC or on the floor of the RNC.
[01:56:12.345 --> 01:56:14.106]  That was an awesome 20 seconds.
[01:56:15.067 --> 01:56:16.428]  That was more like 40 seconds.
[01:56:17.148 --> 01:56:17.749]  Oh, okay.
[01:56:18.710 --> 01:56:22.433]  Well, listen, a long time ago I called you from my little paper-pushing office.
[01:56:22.953 --> 01:56:24.634]  It was seven or eight years ago.
[01:56:24.674 --> 01:56:26.716]  I said, hey, man, I want to get involved.
[01:56:27.096 --> 01:56:29.418]  And you actually offered to have me...
[01:56:30.632 --> 01:56:35.115]  Either keep the camera running or screen a call or something like that.
[01:56:35.515 --> 01:56:37.896]  That was then, this is now.
[01:56:38.236 --> 01:56:39.057]  I'd like to meet you.
[01:56:39.257 --> 01:56:39.957]  Let me stop you.
[01:56:39.977 --> 01:56:41.318]  We don't screen call, sir.
[01:56:41.658 --> 01:56:41.958]  Okay.
[01:56:42.079 --> 01:56:43.659]  When you called here, what did we ask you?
[01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:47.282]  Well, I just wanted to talk to you and tell you that I'm interested.
[01:56:47.322 --> 01:56:48.722]  No, no, but I'm being clear here.
[01:56:48.762 --> 01:56:51.504]  When you call to come on this show right now, what did we ask you?
[01:56:52.316 --> 01:56:53.337]  Oh, nothing.
[01:56:53.557 --> 01:56:54.017]  Nothing at all.
[01:56:54.418 --> 01:56:56.299]  Yeah, so I just don't want people thinking I screen calls.
[01:56:56.499 --> 01:56:57.119]  No, no, no.
[01:56:57.139 --> 01:57:00.562]  I'm talking about a long time ago, back when you were in your ACTV studio.
[01:57:00.602 --> 01:57:04.544]  Yeah, by screening calls, all we do is ask where you're calling from and what your name is.
[01:57:04.724 --> 01:57:05.005]  Okay.
[01:57:05.105 --> 01:57:07.386]  Sometimes we'll ask what you want to talk about and we have a guest on.
[01:57:07.786 --> 01:57:11.429]  Well, you extended an opportunity for me to get involved that way.
[01:57:11.549 --> 01:57:12.770]  That was then, this is now.
[01:57:13.410 --> 01:57:14.331]  I sent you an email.
[01:57:14.351 --> 01:57:17.613]  I'm not sure that I would get to talk to you today, and I'm very happy that I am.
[01:57:18.403 --> 01:57:20.384]  Just real quick, I work 40 hours a week.
[01:57:20.604 --> 01:57:21.305]  I'm a father.
[01:57:21.325 --> 01:57:22.545]  I've got another one on the way.
[01:57:22.565 --> 01:57:22.846]  Stay there.
[01:57:22.866 --> 01:57:24.587]  We're going to start the third hour, my friend.
[01:57:24.607 --> 01:57:26.488]  So we'll go back to you, Jimmy.
[01:57:26.548 --> 01:57:27.388]  I appreciate your holding.
[01:57:27.848 --> 01:57:30.330]  And we'll go to everybody else that's holding.
[01:57:30.350 --> 01:57:31.330]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:33.151 --> 01:57:34.332]  I'll tell you how to get involved.
[01:57:34.352 --> 01:57:35.413]  Start your own website.
[01:57:35.433 --> 01:57:36.933]  Get your own radio show on the weekend.
[01:57:36.953 --> 01:57:38.314]  Get your own access show.
[01:57:38.354 --> 01:57:41.376]  We need more leaders, not followers of Alex Jones.
[01:57:49.744 --> 01:57:50.385]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.065 --> 01:57:52.106]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.826 --> 01:57:53.927]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.587 --> 01:57:55.407]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.168 --> 01:57:57.048]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.068 --> 01:58:01.511]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.911 --> 01:58:06.033]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.154 --> 01:58:11.016]  All right, my friends, into hour number three on the September 7, 2004...
[01:58:14.204 --> 01:58:19.210]  Tuesday edition as we accelerate towards the third anniversary of the globalist terror attacks on 9-11.
[01:58:19.591 --> 01:58:22.034]  Remember the globalist attack Madrid trains on 3-11.
[01:58:22.054 --> 01:58:22.755]  911 days after 9-11 on 3-11.
[01:58:22.775 --> 01:58:24.097]  They love numerology.
[01:58:24.117 --> 01:58:26.219]  They love to flaunt it and throw it in our face.
[01:58:31.218 --> 01:58:34.000]  We'll get into the Russian situation, horrible developments there.
[01:58:34.060 --> 01:58:35.441]  Seven Marines killed yesterday.
[01:58:35.922 --> 01:58:38.704]  More on what happened to myself and others in New York City.
[01:58:39.225 --> 01:58:43.468]  That adventure into the depths of the police state, into the hearts of darkness.
[01:58:44.189 --> 01:58:46.310]  But right now, we're talking to Jimmy in Texas.
[01:58:46.671 --> 01:58:47.571]  Jimmy, thanks for holding.
[01:58:47.591 --> 01:58:49.113]  Go ahead and finish up what you were trying to say.
[01:58:49.313 --> 01:58:49.613]  Okay.
[01:58:50.414 --> 01:58:50.674]  All right.
[01:58:50.794 --> 01:58:54.637]  First of all, I understand the start your own website thing.
[01:58:54.897 --> 01:59:00.602]  Do you think I can be effective putting a different website, yet another website with the same links?
[01:59:01.283 --> 01:59:01.523]  Yes.
[01:59:01.963 --> 01:59:03.324]  Okay, and I will attempt that.
[01:59:05.485 --> 01:59:09.026]  Am I going to get a chance to meet you, being that I'm an Austinite?
[01:59:09.586 --> 01:59:10.907]  I go to events sometimes.
[01:59:10.947 --> 01:59:12.127]  I'm usually just working.
[01:59:12.267 --> 01:59:14.288]  It's not like you're meeting some glamorous person.
[01:59:14.308 --> 01:59:20.270]  I understand that, but I'm talking about being a soldier here in the fight, okay?
[01:59:20.370 --> 01:59:22.351]  And I can be very influential to other people, too.
[01:59:23.454 --> 01:59:26.195]  You said it yourself.
[01:59:26.235 --> 01:59:31.916]  It's about not watching the freaking Playboy and the sports and beating our fat faces anymore.
[01:59:31.956 --> 01:59:33.076]  It's about doing something.
[01:59:33.316 --> 01:59:36.177]  And I think I can tear people away from their bullshit.
[01:59:36.257 --> 01:59:37.497]  Okay, thanks for the call, sir.
[01:59:38.077 --> 01:59:42.438]  Listen, I'm going to try to explain this to you as simply as I can, okay?
[01:59:44.358 --> 01:59:46.839]  Everybody looks to me to tell them what to do.
[01:59:47.719 --> 01:59:51.781]  People look to me that they want to come work for me and be involved with myself.
[01:59:51.862 --> 01:59:57.285]  I'm just one guy who makes documentaries, who has a syndicated radio show, who has some websites.
[01:59:58.245 --> 02:00:01.207]  That's all I'm doing.
[02:00:01.227 --> 02:00:03.268]  And people get frustrated and then get angry.
[02:00:03.308 --> 02:00:06.570]  They want me to go out and be the leader for them.
[02:00:07.551 --> 02:00:10.833]  I told you, obviously, seven years ago, go get your own Axios TV show.
[02:00:11.493 --> 02:00:14.055]  Tens of thousands of people watch it every time you're on here in Austin.
[02:00:14.095 --> 02:00:14.595]  Have you done that?
[02:00:16.350 --> 02:00:17.191]  To put up a website.
[02:00:17.211 --> 02:00:18.052]  You say you're going to do that.
[02:00:18.152 --> 02:00:18.492]  Do that.
[02:00:19.233 --> 02:00:20.353]  Okay, that's what you need to do.
[02:00:20.654 --> 02:00:25.137]  And then you also need to be articulate and be a little more genteel, sir.
[02:00:26.018 --> 02:00:29.100]  Let us now go ahead and take another call.
[02:00:30.241 --> 02:00:31.642]  Let's talk to Ron in New York.
[02:00:31.742 --> 02:00:32.603]  Ron, you're on the air.
[02:00:32.623 --> 02:00:33.083]  Go ahead.
[02:00:33.103 --> 02:00:33.824]  Hi, Alex.
[02:00:34.184 --> 02:00:34.464]  Hello.
[02:00:34.724 --> 02:00:37.006]  I hope you enjoyed your trip to New York.
[02:00:37.947 --> 02:00:39.268]  I've never been this exhausted.
[02:00:40.070 --> 02:00:40.911]  It was someplace.
[02:00:41.171 --> 02:00:46.414]  It was four or five of the bitterest days that I could recall in the history of this city, at least in my life.
[02:00:46.434 --> 02:00:47.395]  Well, how many people left?
[02:00:47.415 --> 02:00:49.737]  Because some counties said 50%, some said 80%.
[02:00:50.017 --> 02:00:52.719]  The news said half of New Yorkers left the city.
[02:00:52.759 --> 02:00:54.380]  The people said they'd never seen it that empty.
[02:00:54.920 --> 02:01:04.326]  I think there was a flight of somewhere, to be honest, about maybe 30 or so percent of people from the city as a result of that, which, when you're talking about a city of 8 million people, do the math.
[02:01:04.346 --> 02:01:05.167]  That's a lot of people.
[02:01:06.047 --> 02:01:08.349]  I would say that it was in and around that amount of people.
[02:01:08.999 --> 02:01:14.780]  It was interesting to hear about Michael Moore, and I have to tell you that I have always had some suspicion about him.
[02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:30.464]  In spite of his posing himself as the opposition to the evil, for a long time now, I have always felt really what he was, was just part of maybe a false alternative.
[02:01:30.484 --> 02:01:31.804]  Yeah, he's a steam valve.
[02:01:32.304 --> 02:01:33.684]  Right, a false alternative.
[02:01:33.764 --> 02:01:34.444]  That's what he is.
[02:01:34.464 --> 02:01:35.425]  You see, this is what they do.
[02:01:36.625 --> 02:01:36.945]  You have...
[02:01:37.751 --> 02:01:48.580]  Bad guys A and bad guys in Group B. He might be the bad guy in Group A who criticized the bad guys in Group B. So it looks as though there's competition, that there's an alternative there.
[02:01:48.700 --> 02:01:51.762]  It looks as if there's separation, yes.
[02:01:51.922 --> 02:01:53.804]  Right, when in fact there really isn't.
[02:01:54.524 --> 02:02:00.209]  And what you've just reported merely confirmed what I have felt about him for at least three years now.
[02:02:01.330 --> 02:02:04.773]  That he really wasn't this... You know, a lot of people see him as this...
[02:02:05.672 --> 02:02:10.315]  I don't know, knight in shining armor, or this guy who wears the white hat, he's out to save us.
[02:02:10.876 --> 02:02:11.396]  No, folks.
[02:02:11.616 --> 02:02:12.917]  He's the false alternative.
[02:02:13.457 --> 02:02:14.318]  This is what they do.
[02:02:14.578 --> 02:02:18.281]  They set up the false alternative, and in the end, it always equals the same thing.
[02:02:18.901 --> 02:02:20.642]  And he might have some utility in that.
[02:02:20.682 --> 02:02:23.164]  He did drip out some information that was useful.
[02:02:23.964 --> 02:02:30.208]  But basically, he probably didn't even bore into the issue as deeply as he could have and should have, because he's not a real alternative.
[02:02:30.629 --> 02:02:32.670]  Hey, Ron, have you talked to police in New York?
[02:02:32.690 --> 02:02:34.091]  I mean, what's the aftermath?
[02:02:34.151 --> 02:02:35.132]  Tell us when we get back.
[02:02:36.248 --> 02:02:36.889]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:36.949 --> 02:02:40.656]  Let Ron finish up, go to other calls, and then to what else happened in New York.
[02:02:40.696 --> 02:02:41.338]  Please stay with us.
[02:02:47.620 --> 02:02:53.125]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:53.546 --> 02:02:57.770]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:02:58.010 --> 02:03:05.057]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:05.417 --> 02:03:11.523]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:11.663 --> 02:03:12.884]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:13.064 --> 02:03:13.545]  We're good to go.
[02:03:30.004 --> 02:03:33.149]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[02:03:33.169 --> 02:03:34.412]  866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:03:34.432 --> 02:03:34.672]  Call today.
[02:03:45.834 --> 02:03:54.901]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:03:55.161 --> 02:04:06.389]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:04:06.730 --> 02:04:12.454]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:04:12.674 --> 02:04:19.337]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:19.537 --> 02:04:26.360]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:28.401]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[02:04:28.681 --> 02:04:30.722]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[02:04:30.942 --> 02:04:32.643]  Get a two-pack for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175.
[02:04:32.823 --> 02:04:33.503]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:33.523 --> 02:04:33.704]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:42.847 --> 02:04:48.468]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:04:48.628 --> 02:04:53.049]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals and operations of the New World Order.
[02:04:53.209 --> 02:04:57.571]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:04:57.611 --> 02:04:58.971]  The New World Order.
[02:05:00.752 --> 02:05:04.974]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:05:05.034 --> 02:05:11.977]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:05:12.097 --> 02:05:14.138]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:05:14.458 --> 02:05:24.843]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:05:25.104 --> 02:05:26.084]  If you want to understand
[02:05:26.184 --> 02:05:31.106]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:56.588 --> 02:05:57.429]  Alright, we're back live.
[02:05:57.449 --> 02:05:58.490]  We're talking to Ron in New York.
[02:05:58.530 --> 02:05:59.431]  He calls in routinely.
[02:05:59.451 --> 02:06:01.172]  He's a retired New York police officer.
[02:06:01.933 --> 02:06:07.077]  Ron, I got to New York, and the police weren't as aggressive.
[02:06:07.117 --> 02:06:09.879]  By the end of it, they were viciously aggressive.
[02:06:10.460 --> 02:06:13.002]  I was treated with total disrespect, and many others were.
[02:06:13.122 --> 02:06:18.567]  Women, children, bossing, screaming at people ten miles away from the convention center.
[02:06:18.587 --> 02:06:19.928]  It had nothing to do with security.
[02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:26.086]  And I'm interested, have you talked to any police officers, any of your friends, about what they thought last week?
[02:06:26.287 --> 02:06:26.547]  I have.
[02:06:26.667 --> 02:06:28.649]  In fact, I saw some of that go on myself.
[02:06:28.750 --> 02:06:37.940]  I took a soldier in two into midtown Manhattan, and I'll be honest with you, the conduct I saw was administered on the part of a number of people.
[02:06:38.621 --> 02:06:40.724]  I know how to observe without being really seen.
[02:06:41.597 --> 02:06:48.585]  And I've got to say, it's shameful and it's not really consistent with the police agency that I remember, though it was not perfect.
[02:06:49.025 --> 02:06:50.226]  It was not that imperfect.
[02:06:50.286 --> 02:06:57.274]  And my discussion with people and friends is as follows, and this is something I hope you examine and your audience will think about.
[02:06:57.774 --> 02:07:02.880]  Many of these cops who were out at this protest, they started off nice for two reasons.
[02:07:03.948 --> 02:07:06.009]  Maybe they were fresh and not exhausted.
[02:07:06.170 --> 02:07:09.011]  They made these men work mandatory 12-hour shifts.
[02:07:09.092 --> 02:07:13.194]  And they told me that there was a two-hour overlays.
[02:07:13.234 --> 02:07:14.775]  It was really 14-hour shifts.
[02:07:14.995 --> 02:07:23.081]  Right, because there's a face-to-face relief, and if the guy's supposed to relieve you, he's a little late, or he gets tied up in traffic or whatever, you wind up stuck longer.
[02:07:23.461 --> 02:07:26.003]  And much of that, and Alex, you know how hot it was here.
[02:07:26.383 --> 02:07:32.047]  Could you imagine 12 to 14 hours, four, five days, six days straight, under those conditions?
[02:07:32.831 --> 02:07:40.484]  I think that they deliberately, and I say this, I'm talking about the elites who are at the top of what I call the totem pole of the pyramid.
[02:07:40.845 --> 02:07:46.114]  I think that they deliberately set it up so these guys would be in a situation where they're sleep-deprived.
[02:07:47.108 --> 02:07:49.730]  I think these guys were manipulated and administrated into it that way.
[02:07:49.750 --> 02:07:51.411]  Now that's not an excuse for what they did.
[02:08:10.985 --> 02:08:11.646]  They're human beings.
[02:08:11.666 --> 02:08:13.228]  They're not dogs, and they should know better.
[02:08:13.248 --> 02:08:17.655]  Well, I was soaked in sweat wearing a light cotton button-up shirt.
[02:08:18.055 --> 02:08:20.639]  These guys were in black helmets, body armor.
[02:08:21.648 --> 02:08:31.775]  Equipment hanging all over them, machine guns, and I know I talked to cops, it was 14 hours, because at 12 hours, they had to wait until the whole other shift crossed over.
[02:08:31.815 --> 02:08:33.016]  It was 14 hour days.
[02:08:33.216 --> 02:08:36.078]  Called face-to-face relief, that's right, and it would be extended.
[02:08:36.178 --> 02:08:41.642]  And under those circumstances, picture how that could play on a human being, his disposition and psyche.
[02:08:42.063 --> 02:08:46.686]  Plus, on top of that, as it started to go on, you know, the second, the third, the fourth day,
[02:08:47.518 --> 02:08:51.915]  Their supervisors, and you saw those white shirts walking around the street, I'm sure, Alex.
[02:08:52.941 --> 02:08:53.581]  Hundreds of them.
[02:08:54.161 --> 02:08:54.421]  Right.
[02:08:54.541 --> 02:08:56.302]  They would start to pressure them more.
[02:08:56.582 --> 02:09:00.383]  Maybe the chief pressured the captain who pressured the lieutenant who pressured the men.
[02:09:00.943 --> 02:09:14.906]  Or they would start with some boogeyman stories about, well, we have to be twice as much on our toes today because there's more likelihood that the anarchists, this was their big Ewan cry, the anarchists, that never, by the way, never really developed in the way that they said.
[02:09:14.926 --> 02:09:16.066]  Well, we have video of it.
[02:09:16.166 --> 02:09:20.567]  Ten guys would set on fire a big papier-mâché dragon or bush doll.
[02:09:20.627 --> 02:09:21.487]  I'll pay for it.
[02:09:22.647 --> 02:09:31.231]  And then, I video, the police would ignore them, and then their captains would order them into the mass crowd that was screaming for the anarchists to stop, and they would attack the peaceful crowd.
[02:09:31.471 --> 02:09:36.674]  Well, Alex, that's true, and if your audience doesn't believe it, I'm going to put something to them to help them think.
[02:09:37.314 --> 02:09:46.538]  They all saw in the national news, this was broadcast, I know that much on the national news, the guy who was kicking the officer who was downed off the motor scooter, all right?
[02:09:47.282 --> 02:09:50.585]  Now, if they look very closely, they'll see a brother officer.
[02:09:50.945 --> 02:09:59.332]  Another officer comes along, takes absolutely no definitive action against the guy who's doing the kicking, just tells him to cool down, and lets him go.
[02:09:59.352 --> 02:10:00.473]  Yeah, that's on video.
[02:10:00.633 --> 02:10:05.256]  A cop in uniform walks right up and talks nicely to the guy who's attacking him.
[02:10:05.417 --> 02:10:06.958]  Just stomped his brother officer.
[02:10:07.058 --> 02:10:14.604]  Conversely... Now, if I was a cop and I saw somebody punch and stomp a cop, I would hit the person doing it, but the cops walk over and are nice to the guy.
[02:10:14.744 --> 02:10:14.944]  Right.
[02:10:15.345 --> 02:10:17.226]  But conversely, now here's the analogy.
[02:10:17.366 --> 02:10:21.650]  Conversely, the innocent women run over by the mopeds that started it... They're arrested.
[02:10:21.830 --> 02:10:22.450]  They're arrested.
[02:10:22.691 --> 02:10:22.851]  Right.
[02:10:22.891 --> 02:10:25.013]  The people who did nothing... Instantly on the spot.
[02:10:25.073 --> 02:10:26.054]  It wasn't a mistake.
[02:10:26.414 --> 02:10:26.534]  No.
[02:10:26.554 --> 02:10:27.815]  You think that guy worked for them?
[02:10:28.275 --> 02:10:28.456]  No.
[02:10:29.056 --> 02:10:29.697]  I don't know.
[02:10:29.817 --> 02:10:31.778]  I don't know what to make of it.
[02:10:31.918 --> 02:10:32.239]  It's sick.
[02:10:32.859 --> 02:10:45.227]  People, a small group of people who really were out of line, were treated with more respect than people who were basically decent, just trying to put across a constitutionally protected message, or who were only using their verbiage.
[02:10:46.188 --> 02:10:48.469]  It doesn't make any sense to me, but it did go on.
[02:10:49.029 --> 02:11:00.777]  Now the rest of the people in the country, I'm sure, saw that much film, and I could tell them, they didn't arrest a guy, the police were right there in that film, didn't arrest or do anything or hit that guy, who was stomping a downed officer,
[02:11:01.497 --> 02:11:07.180]  Yet, on the other hand, they scooped up people who weren't doing anything that was remotely violent.
[02:11:07.460 --> 02:11:08.120]  They arrested them.
[02:11:08.980 --> 02:11:11.341]  Where is the logic in that?
[02:11:11.782 --> 02:11:12.682]  What have we come to?
[02:11:13.402 --> 02:11:15.363]  This is the question that has to be asked.
[02:11:15.403 --> 02:11:16.443]  People have to start thinking.
[02:11:17.384 --> 02:11:18.384]  And that went on.
[02:11:18.444 --> 02:11:19.685]  But this is what was getting them.
[02:11:20.105 --> 02:11:24.407]  I know a lot of the problem was that these, what I call police officers, the middlemen,
[02:11:25.279 --> 02:11:26.340]  We're tired, hot.
[02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:30.422]  They were being whipped into a frenzy like by the second, third day by their supervisors.
[02:11:30.902 --> 02:11:32.043]  They're already disgruntled.
[02:11:32.723 --> 02:11:34.444]  And I believe that was done deliberately.
[02:11:34.544 --> 02:11:37.706]  And then they were turned loose on crowds of protesters.
[02:11:37.746 --> 02:11:39.587]  And this is how we had some of the trouble we had.
[02:11:39.607 --> 02:11:40.107]  I hear you.
[02:11:40.147 --> 02:11:40.987]  Thanks for the call.
[02:11:41.168 --> 02:11:45.430]  And just to describe what we started seeing by Tuesday, the second full day there...
[02:11:48.504 --> 02:12:04.628]  They would come with these big orange nets and just randomly, at permitted protest, roll these big giant orange nets out and then make a circle around a crowd of random people, beat them up, and then take them to Pier 57 and admitted to FEMA camp.
[02:12:07.029 --> 02:12:08.409]  It blew me away.
[02:12:09.620 --> 02:12:16.621]  And I interviewed young anarchists who were always led by some old man or woman who was obviously a fed who would be threatening us.
[02:12:17.061 --> 02:12:18.522]  They'd go, yeah, I spit on cops.
[02:12:18.582 --> 02:12:19.822]  Yeah, I broke a police window.
[02:12:20.242 --> 02:12:21.162]  And they let me go.
[02:12:21.182 --> 02:12:21.922]  I have them on tape.
[02:12:21.962 --> 02:12:23.083]  I don't know why they did that.
[02:12:23.383 --> 02:12:25.403]  But then other people randomly were arrested.
[02:12:26.783 --> 02:12:29.804]  And then I was detained by some low-level cops when I was breaking stuff.
[02:12:30.364 --> 02:12:34.965]  And then a supervisor came over at the paddy wagon and looked at me and said, you can go.
[02:12:36.261 --> 02:12:37.442]  I have that on tape!
[02:12:37.923 --> 02:12:41.926]  You've also got young, useful idiots who were communists.
[02:12:41.966 --> 02:12:47.330]  They were wearing commie shirts, but the news called them anarchists because communism doesn't exist, supposedly.
[02:12:48.892 --> 02:12:51.434]  I mean, I saw it, folks, with my own two eyes.
[02:12:51.654 --> 02:12:57.639]  And getting to what happened, you know, Sunday was the first full day with the protests and the marches.
[02:12:57.699 --> 02:12:58.540]  Then by Monday...
[02:12:59.648 --> 02:13:22.471]  We were out there covering more protests, more demonstrations, got threatened with arrests over and over again, went down to ground zero, and for my own two eyes, with my own mind, I sat there and I looked for myself at how Building 7 was way outside the World Trade Center complex, but it caught fire and collapsed that afternoon, wasn't hit by a jet airplane.
[02:13:23.271 --> 02:13:31.516]  But buildings that were not owned by Silverstein, but that were right up against Tower 1 and 2, got minimal damage.
[02:13:33.136 --> 02:13:36.338]  Buildings right up against it didn't get damaged in some cases.
[02:13:36.378 --> 02:13:47.064]  And I've got video, 360 video, standing there, and this will be in the new film, as we show in a 360 around us how nothing had been touched.
[02:13:47.583 --> 02:13:48.184]  We're good to go.
[02:14:05.544 --> 02:14:24.789]  Away from the towers collapsed, and I talked to all these locals and discussed it with them, and they pointed, I probably talked to 20 people at Ground Zero who were told not to go to work that day, or who's, I mean, the individuals themselves, that, well, my son's a Navy SEAL, and he called me the week before and said, don't go into work on September 11th.
[02:14:24.829 --> 02:14:27.509]  I mean, I've got a woman.
[02:14:27.889 --> 02:14:30.750]  My son's a Navy SEAL, and he said, don't go to work.
[02:14:32.231 --> 02:14:34.972]  Person after person after person after person.
[02:14:35.473 --> 02:14:37.974]  And I'd be talking to the police, you know, who wouldn't talk back.
[02:14:38.354 --> 02:14:39.994]  They were just standing there with their machine guns.
[02:14:41.135 --> 02:14:48.998]  And I'd say to them, this is on Monday, I'd say, you know there was asbestos, you know Bush blocked the $90 million to treat you for it.
[02:14:49.665 --> 02:14:51.526]  You know the firefighters said that there were bombs.
[02:14:51.546 --> 02:14:52.926]  You know Building 7 came down.
[02:14:53.247 --> 02:14:54.967]  You know about Operation Northwoods.
[02:14:55.568 --> 02:14:57.528]  And I looked in those police eyes.
[02:14:57.548 --> 02:14:58.589]  They were afraid.
[02:14:58.609 --> 02:15:00.590]  A few of them were nodding to me.
[02:15:00.630 --> 02:15:01.570]  They were scared.
[02:15:01.950 --> 02:15:04.872]  And then a supervisor would... Because they're not stupid.
[02:15:05.452 --> 02:15:08.773]  A supervisor would run over and start screaming at me, threatening to arrest me.
[02:15:09.494 --> 02:15:11.334]  We have all of this on video.
[02:15:12.215 --> 02:15:17.257]  And again, I am going to just beat myself to death on this to have this film done.
[02:15:18.044 --> 02:15:19.566]  By at least mid-November.
[02:15:20.267 --> 02:15:21.869]  It's going to be called Marshall Law.
[02:15:22.530 --> 02:15:28.017]  Nice fitting combo with the new film we just released, American Dictators.
[02:15:29.138 --> 02:15:30.360]  But we detail it all.
[02:15:31.201 --> 02:15:32.523]  And then on Tuesday night...
[02:15:36.665 --> 02:15:47.611]  After I've been in the convention all day, and I'll tell you those stories later, oh, I confronted Michael Medved, the guy that, you know, said basically I should be watched by the government and the Secret Service because of my film, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:15:48.012 --> 02:15:55.576]  I walk up to him inside the convention center in Media Row, Radio Row, where he was broadcasting, and during a break I said, Mr. Medved, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:15:55.596 --> 02:15:56.617]  He goes, yeah, I know who you are.
[02:15:57.277 --> 02:15:58.218]  I'm not going to talk to you.
[02:15:58.238 --> 02:16:00.619]  And his assistants started screaming at me, and I said, no, talk to me.
[02:16:01.551 --> 02:16:03.852]  And I said, you know, why did you say what you said?
[02:16:03.872 --> 02:16:06.152]  He goes, well, for what you said, shouldn't you be watched?
[02:16:06.192 --> 02:16:07.233]  Shouldn't you be controlled?
[02:16:07.753 --> 02:16:11.054]  And he knew exactly who I was, and he's seen the film, and he admitted to it.
[02:16:12.634 --> 02:16:30.400]  But then that night, we met up with a local activist there in town, and he had a cigarette boat with a big old twin engines, and we ran across the river and went to the New Jersey side
[02:16:31.375 --> 02:16:38.440]  And got in his cigarette boat and got a tour at midnight around Manhattan.
[02:16:38.641 --> 02:16:39.321]  It was beautiful.
[02:16:40.262 --> 02:16:46.887]  And when we get back I'll tell you about the gunboats and then I'll tell you about when we got back to the dock taking the subway back across.
[02:16:47.837 --> 02:16:51.979]  Under the Hudson, and what happened on board that subway.
[02:16:52.039 --> 02:16:55.160]  And it was just... I mean, I'm omitting half of what happened.
[02:16:55.180 --> 02:16:56.481]  It's just so much.
[02:16:57.141 --> 02:16:58.842]  I'm going back over all the video now.
[02:16:58.862 --> 02:17:01.703]  I've already watched most of it, the 50-plus hours we shot there.
[02:17:04.267 --> 02:17:05.327]  I was conditioned, though.
[02:17:05.367 --> 02:17:13.069]  By the end of it, I was totally used to being searched, totally used to showing ID, totally used to being screamed at and having cops grab me by the arm and squeeze my arm.
[02:17:13.409 --> 02:17:14.009]  Just standing there.
[02:17:14.029 --> 02:17:20.130]  They walk over, squeeze your arm, and ask you questions and spit in your face, yelling so loud.
[02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:22.571]  And finally, I started saying, I'm going to sue you.
[02:17:22.611 --> 02:17:23.451]  Go ahead and arrest me.
[02:17:23.651 --> 02:17:24.991]  This is America, First Amendment.
[02:17:25.311 --> 02:17:27.632]  When I was being nicer, I got treated like garbage.
[02:17:28.300 --> 02:17:34.846]  But finally at an animal level, I started just getting my fur up, getting my heckles up, and saying, I'm not going along with this.
[02:17:35.507 --> 02:17:40.611]  We'll come back, get more into what happened in New York, and then take your calls and get into the Russia situation.
[02:17:40.932 --> 02:17:41.392]  Stay with us.
[02:17:45.771 --> 02:17:49.434]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:17:49.834 --> 02:17:55.279]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:17:55.739 --> 02:18:00.884]  It makes me wonder if the US citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:18:01.537 --> 02:18:14.840]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Rule in 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:18:15.340 --> 02:18:20.641]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:18:20.941 --> 02:18:26.842]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[02:18:27.483 --> 02:18:27.543]  1-800-686-2237

[02:18:48.383 --> 02:18:51.286]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:18:51.506 --> 02:18:57.692]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:19:50.107 --> 02:19:50.847]  You heard that right.
[02:19:51.027 --> 02:19:53.810]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[02:19:53.990 --> 02:19:55.271]  You don't have to pay them off.
[02:19:55.491 --> 02:19:56.892]  The banks are defrauding you.
[02:19:57.172 --> 02:19:58.513]  Now is the time to fight back.

[02:20:23.679 --> 02:20:25.079]  Don't let the banksters cheat you.
[02:20:25.440 --> 02:20:26.420]  Fight back, America.
[02:20:26.680 --> 02:20:27.460]  Stop the fraud.
[02:20:27.680 --> 02:20:28.480]  Stop the rip-off.
[02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:31.361]  Learn the truth.

[02:20:44.484 --> 02:20:46.985]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[02:20:47.725 --> 02:20:50.366]  Patrick Henry said, Give me liberty or give me death.
[02:20:51.118 --> 02:21:07.284]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny?
[02:21:08.224 --> 02:21:13.426]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.
[02:21:14.235 --> 02:21:22.181]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:21:23.202 --> 02:21:23.743]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[02:21:23.763 --> 02:21:24.023]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:21:24.063 --> 02:21:24.483]  But call us free.
[02:21:24.503 --> 02:21:29.867]  Our operators are standing by to take your order for a year's subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:21:51.065 --> 02:21:55.106]  All right, Robert and Brian and Paul and John, everybody, your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[02:21:55.966 --> 02:21:57.207]  I want to try to calm down a bit.
[02:21:57.247 --> 02:21:59.047]  I'm getting sped up here because there's so much to cover.
[02:21:59.067 --> 02:22:00.748]  And get back to New York.
[02:22:01.908 --> 02:22:05.529]  On Tuesday night, we went out on this cigarette boat from New Jersey.
[02:22:06.830 --> 02:22:09.511]  Big old twin-engine sucker, you know, that'll go 80 miles an hour.
[02:22:09.531 --> 02:22:12.551]  And we started out, and we cruised up by the Statue of Liberty.
[02:22:12.572 --> 02:22:13.932]  You know, we were a quarter mile away.
[02:22:14.921 --> 02:22:16.002]  I think we're good to go.
[02:22:30.899 --> 02:22:33.661]  And then we went ahead and left, and then they started wanting to race us.
[02:22:33.721 --> 02:22:36.963]  They came back, so we raced the Coast Guard, and that was fine.
[02:22:37.584 --> 02:22:39.265]  And then blew them away, by the way.
[02:22:39.285 --> 02:22:43.888]  And then later, another Coast Guard boat on the other side of Manhattan pulled up, and we talked to them.
[02:22:43.928 --> 02:22:44.689]  They were pretty nice.
[02:22:45.349 --> 02:22:50.793]  Well, they were, you know, aiming their M60 machine guns at us when they first pulled up to us.
[02:22:51.213 --> 02:22:53.455]  But, I mean, this really is martial law, folks.
[02:22:55.163 --> 02:22:57.505]  But quite frankly, that is terrorism related.
[02:22:57.525 --> 02:23:03.428]  If you really think somebody's planning to carry out some type of attack, that's where you'll have security is the ports.
[02:23:04.149 --> 02:23:06.510]  But there we were driving by the big container yards.
[02:23:06.670 --> 02:23:07.991]  None of those ships were being searched.
[02:23:08.631 --> 02:23:10.913]  One out of, what, a couple hundred containers get searched.
[02:23:11.753 --> 02:23:13.775]  So really even that security was a joke.
[02:23:14.715 --> 02:23:17.677]  But we had a chance to drive around Manhattan and get the big view of it.
[02:23:18.918 --> 02:23:21.579]  Then we came back to the dock at around 2 a.m.,
[02:23:23.717 --> 02:23:26.839]  And we'd taken taxis over, but those were like 50 bucks apiece.
[02:23:26.899 --> 02:23:28.380]  I said, let's take the subway back.
[02:23:28.781 --> 02:23:34.664]  So we walked a quarter mile to a subway that went underneath the water there.
[02:23:34.844 --> 02:23:39.527]  I guess at that point it was the Hudson opening up into the bay there.
[02:23:40.368 --> 02:23:52.115]  And we stopped at the first stop in New York, deep underground, and there was this old woman, had to be 80 years old, with her head literally resting on her chest, you know, very sad person, huge hunchback,
[02:23:52.788 --> 02:23:54.009]  And so we gave her some money.
[02:23:55.251 --> 02:23:56.812]  One of the folks we were with gave her some money.
[02:23:57.573 --> 02:24:00.656]  And as John Statmiller did, went and gave her $5.
[02:24:00.776 --> 02:24:02.498]  I said, you know, give her some money.
[02:24:02.518 --> 02:24:03.219]  We were videotaping.
[02:24:03.259 --> 02:24:04.100]  He went and gave her $5.
[02:24:04.520 --> 02:24:09.285]  All of a sudden, two cops jump out, start yelling at us, go erase that tape, get off the train.
[02:24:10.314 --> 02:24:12.876]  Luckily, the train stopped for 10 minutes, so we barely got back on.
[02:24:13.717 --> 02:24:17.240]  They made me erase it, watched me rewind it, then hit record.
[02:24:17.340 --> 02:24:18.221]  They were so foolish.
[02:24:18.261 --> 02:24:21.263]  I was recording them to erase it, and I said, see the red light?
[02:24:21.543 --> 02:24:23.105]  Now tell me what you wanted me to do again.
[02:24:23.125 --> 02:24:38.938]  And then a woman who was with us, an activist who'd gone out with a guy that owned the boat, she took a photo from her still camera, and the police freaked out, went over, grabbed it, broke it open, ripped the film out, broke the camera,
[02:24:40.575 --> 02:24:44.320]  Again, yelling at her, wrote down her name and said, I'm going to investigate you.
[02:24:44.340 --> 02:24:45.281]  I'm going to report you.
[02:24:45.922 --> 02:24:47.383]  You might not be able to fly now.
[02:24:47.504 --> 02:24:48.585]  You may go on a list.
[02:24:49.266 --> 02:24:53.050]  She was begging and sort of crying, please, no, please, oh, no.
[02:24:53.591 --> 02:24:55.533]  Yeah, we're going to write down all your information.
[02:24:55.553 --> 02:24:57.556]  We're going to keep track of you.
[02:24:58.951 --> 02:25:02.252]  And then the next day they were arresting thousands of protesters, at least 2,000.
[02:25:02.673 --> 02:25:15.278]  They put tape over their mouths, load them in these trucks for 10, 15 hours with handcuffs, parked outside in the heat, and they put them in this un-air-conditioned, giant bus terminal, Pier 57, out over the Hudson.
[02:25:16.525 --> 02:25:26.937]  They admittedly, one protester snuck a digital camera in and got photos that were in the New York Daily News website of big barbed wire fences with Constantino wire inside of it.
[02:25:27.197 --> 02:25:30.120]  You had to ask permission to get out maybe once or twice a day.
[02:25:30.140 --> 02:25:31.442]  They let you use the bathroom.
[02:25:31.742 --> 02:25:33.224]  There were no cots or benches.
[02:25:33.244 --> 02:25:37.829]  They just slept in the old motor oil of 60 plus years of that being a bus terminal.
[02:25:38.689 --> 02:25:39.169]  We're good to go.
[02:26:08.357 --> 02:26:09.818]  Leave mainstream media alone.
[02:26:10.338 --> 02:26:11.259]  Go after us.
[02:26:11.459 --> 02:26:15.382]  We found out they got a memo from the police department on how to harass independent media.
[02:26:15.662 --> 02:26:17.123]  It's like it was Iraq or something.
[02:26:19.104 --> 02:26:30.612]  And I went in, of course, on Tuesday and videotaped Schwarzenegger's speech and just to sit there and to hear him talk about the tyranny of Austria under the Soviets and how they couldn't look the police in the eyes and how they could be arrested for no reason.
[02:26:31.112 --> 02:26:35.715]  That's what I was living outside the convention while Schwarzenegger was giving his speech.
[02:26:37.578 --> 02:26:42.299]  And it was just amazing to hear him go, we will not falter, we will not waver, you know, these weird Hitler quotes.
[02:26:43.180 --> 02:26:46.961]  And most people, 99% didn't understand what they were watching or viewing.
[02:26:48.281 --> 02:26:57.744]  And to watch just almost all the Republicans screaming and cheering in reckless abandon for Arnold when he is the most liberal governor in the country.
[02:26:58.844 --> 02:27:03.186]  Open borders, gun control, abortion on demand, all of this stuff.
[02:27:03.306 --> 02:27:04.906]  And oh, he's our conservative savior.
[02:27:05.146 --> 02:27:07.107]  He was involved in the Enron scamming.
[02:27:08.112 --> 02:27:09.313]  But he's going to be our savior.
[02:27:10.014 --> 02:27:14.237]  He's going to get the evil Gray Davis, who frankly wasn't even as big government as Arnold.
[02:27:14.257 --> 02:27:16.999]  I'm not defending Gray Davis either, folks.
[02:27:17.039 --> 02:27:19.721]  The point is they give you something even worse and call it conservative.
[02:27:20.762 --> 02:27:24.364]  I'll tell you about some of the... Oh, my confrontation with Neil Bortz.
[02:27:25.505 --> 02:27:32.390]  And much more when we get back, and then some calls, and I'll get into the whole Russia situation and kind of blitz through a bunch of other important news articles.
[02:27:32.410 --> 02:27:32.851]  Stay with us.
[02:27:35.558 --> 02:27:36.459]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.940 --> 02:27:38.562]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.483 --> 02:27:42.146]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.689 --> 02:27:48.051]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:27:48.292 --> 02:27:52.136]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:27:52.456 --> 02:27:53.277]  Read the labels.
[02:27:53.697 --> 02:27:57.841]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:27:58.041 --> 02:28:02.246]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:28:02.626 --> 02:28:07.491]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:28:07.871 --> 02:28:11.413]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:28:11.633 --> 02:28:16.976]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:28:17.256 --> 02:28:19.977]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:28:20.277 --> 02:28:21.178]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:28:44.918 --> 02:28:46.899]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[02:28:46.979 --> 02:28:57.706]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:28:58.087 --> 02:29:02.609]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:29:02.669 --> 02:29:14.017]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:29:14.597 --> 02:29:21.439]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:29:21.839 --> 02:29:23.980]  Your purified water is now ready.
[02:29:24.460 --> 02:29:29.422]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[02:29:29.742 --> 02:29:40.287]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:29:40.527 --> 02:29:41.347]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.979 --> 02:29:47.460]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[02:29:47.661 --> 02:29:55.007]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[02:29:55.327 --> 02:29:59.731]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:30:00.011 --> 02:30:09.840]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[02:30:10.220 --> 02:30:11.161]  We're good to go.
[02:30:28.510 --> 02:30:29.050]  My new film...
[02:30:58.380 --> 02:30:59.842]  American Dictators is out.
[02:30:59.882 --> 02:31:02.684]  It's a little bit shorter than my two and a half hour videos.
[02:31:03.345 --> 02:31:04.506]  It's 90 minutes long.
[02:31:04.546 --> 02:31:06.548]  It gets into the fake left-right paradigm.
[02:31:06.969 --> 02:31:08.650]  Bush and Kerry being cousins.
[02:31:08.711 --> 02:31:12.554]  The staged nature of the 2004 upcoming election.
[02:31:13.876 --> 02:31:14.656]  Skull and Bones.
[02:31:14.697 --> 02:31:16.378]  We revisit Bohemian Grove.
[02:31:16.959 --> 02:31:19.321]  We get into the whole police state that's being set up.
[02:31:19.341 --> 02:31:19.942]  We expose...
[02:31:20.935 --> 02:31:23.557]  Ralph Nader is a neocon shill, basically.
[02:31:24.157 --> 02:31:26.598]  It's a great new video, great way to wake folks up.

[02:31:42.467 --> 02:31:43.588]  It's such a great deal, folks.
[02:31:43.608 --> 02:31:44.368]  And we had to do this.
[02:31:44.388 --> 02:31:46.029]  We had to charge for some of the content.

[02:31:48.668 --> 02:31:49.909]  We're victims of our own success.

[02:32:47.339 --> 02:32:49.242]  You need to have it, folks, so please order it today.
[02:32:50.620 --> 02:32:51.260]  This is what I'm going to do.
[02:32:51.280 --> 02:32:53.282]  I'm going to take five more calls, and that's it for calls.
[02:32:53.302 --> 02:32:55.863]  I want to finish up what happened in New York, get to some other news.
[02:32:57.104 --> 02:32:58.905]  Next up is Robert in California.
[02:32:58.945 --> 02:32:59.805]  Robert, you're on the air.
[02:32:59.865 --> 02:33:00.306]  Go ahead.
[02:33:00.806 --> 02:33:03.467]  Alex Jones, you're a great American patriot.
[02:33:03.568 --> 02:33:05.148]  No, I'm just doing my job, my friend.
[02:33:05.168 --> 02:33:06.089]  What's going on?
[02:33:06.269 --> 02:33:08.230]  I'm a subscriber, and I've watched all your videos.
[02:33:08.550 --> 02:33:11.812]  I listen online, and I taped the whole convention.
[02:33:11.832 --> 02:33:18.176]  And what I found was incredible orchestration of world events during the RNC convention.
[02:33:18.866 --> 02:33:28.330]  And that officer you talked to earlier about the 14-hour work shift, government agitation, we know they have sound cannons, microwave cannons.
[02:33:28.490 --> 02:33:32.431]  They've admitted they control the weather, so it shouldn't be surprising.
[02:33:32.451 --> 02:33:38.394]  By the way, I got video of those sound guns on the roof and on these big armored vehicles.
[02:33:39.474 --> 02:33:46.617]  So then, right at the day the convention ends, Clinton decides to get a quadruple bypass, and...
[02:33:47.523 --> 02:33:55.770]  We have multiple storms, multiple terror events, and it just seems all very, very coordinated to keep the headlines full of distraction.
[02:33:55.910 --> 02:34:01.435]  Well, for those that don't know, they really can create earthquakes and hurricanes and storms.
[02:34:01.535 --> 02:34:08.281]  I mean, I've got on video Secretary of Defense Cohen back in 97 saying that.
[02:34:08.841 --> 02:34:15.767]  I just watched the Bloomberg report on how everything went so fantastically in New York, and there was no more than eight hours...
[02:34:16.266 --> 02:34:17.367]  Yeah, here was the problem.
[02:34:17.387 --> 02:34:18.087]  Here was the problem.
[02:34:45.419 --> 02:34:47.121]  We switched servers last week.
[02:34:48.061 --> 02:34:53.426]  And so a lot of the email up until last week didn't get to me.
[02:34:53.746 --> 02:34:57.569]  Please resend all of that to tips at infowars.com and say pictures.
[02:34:57.950 --> 02:34:58.430]  Oh, excellent.
[02:34:58.690 --> 02:35:00.372]  You've already posted some pictures I took.
[02:35:00.732 --> 02:35:02.213]  A bunch of other pictures are going up.
[02:35:02.514 --> 02:35:04.095]  I've been collecting hundreds of them all week.
[02:35:04.115 --> 02:35:05.896]  I have everything you've been talking about.
[02:35:06.117 --> 02:35:07.117]  Everything's right there.
[02:35:07.358 --> 02:35:10.160]  Please send them to tips at infowars.com.
[02:35:10.280 --> 02:35:13.503]  I was just collecting some pictures this morning on Putin, the Russia thing.
[02:35:13.985 --> 02:35:15.706]  And there's 338 dead.
[02:35:15.746 --> 02:35:17.867]  They said there's still many, many missing.
[02:35:18.467 --> 02:35:26.790]  And now we had Putin this morning, Powell, Bush, and Rumsfeld all beating the drum floor saying we're going to go over there and get those terrorists.
[02:35:26.890 --> 02:35:35.474]  When everybody there, right now there's a demonstration in front of the Kremlin with 10,000 to 15,000 crying women saying the government has something to do with this.
[02:35:36.294 --> 02:35:39.816]  Well, it's just like Madrid now proving to be the government.
[02:35:40.976 --> 02:35:42.477]  I think it's coming apart at the seams.
[02:35:43.177 --> 02:35:57.080]  Well, I know that, exactly, I know that at the Moscow Theater, they nerve-gassed the people, they supposedly killed every terrorist, but witnesses that survived said that it was men from the Russian government in there doing the shooting.
[02:35:57.580 --> 02:35:58.060]  It's simple.
[02:35:58.100 --> 02:36:01.381]  They go take over, they pose as terrorists, they then escape out the back door.
[02:36:01.981 --> 02:36:09.883]  What, three months ago, there was the Riyadh bombing in Saudi Arabia, and the Saudis admitted it was in the London Telegraph, were ordered to let the terrorists escape.
[02:36:10.512 --> 02:36:16.614]  Yeah, and they found him like one second after it was done over there in Saudi Arabia.
[02:36:16.634 --> 02:36:20.556]  Remember they said, oh, we found the terrorist right after they committed it, and then where'd they go?
[02:36:20.596 --> 02:36:21.236]  They got let go.
[02:36:21.256 --> 02:36:22.856]  That was admitted.
[02:36:22.896 --> 02:36:24.197]  One more thing right here in San Diego.
[02:36:24.997 --> 02:36:29.899]  They admitted that San Diego is the last big American city that doesn't have fluoride in their water.
[02:36:30.279 --> 02:36:32.760]  I live in North County of San Diego, Escondido.
[02:36:33.060 --> 02:36:38.062]  They started putting fluoride in our water last week, and now San Diego this morning said, oh, what a great idea!
[02:36:38.857 --> 02:36:47.303]  And I think it's because we have lots of military bases right here, three or four big ones, and I think we're just going to affect everybody.
[02:36:47.323 --> 02:36:49.885]  I don't know anybody.
[02:36:50.665 --> 02:36:51.026]  It will.
[02:36:51.086 --> 02:36:51.726]  Thanks for the call.
[02:36:51.766 --> 02:36:52.306]  Great points.
[02:36:52.386 --> 02:36:53.047]  It does, folks.
[02:36:53.087 --> 02:36:54.588]  I've got the major university studies.
[02:36:54.648 --> 02:36:55.188]  It's a fact.
[02:36:56.409 --> 02:36:59.852]  But if they care about you, the government wouldn't hurt you, just all those eugenics programs.
[02:37:00.692 --> 02:37:01.693]  Brooke in Rhode Island.
[02:37:01.713 --> 02:37:02.313]  Go ahead, Brooke.
[02:37:02.333 --> 02:37:03.074]  I've got to go quicker here.
[02:37:03.889 --> 02:37:06.410]  This is Brian in North Carolina.
[02:37:06.510 --> 02:37:07.911]  Okay, Brian in North Carolina.
[02:37:07.931 --> 02:37:10.192]  I was told that Brooke was next, but go ahead, Brian.
[02:37:10.732 --> 02:37:13.553]  Okay, I was curious about the death toll from Charlie.
[02:37:13.573 --> 02:37:14.654]  I don't think it's accurate.
[02:37:14.814 --> 02:37:17.255]  Something just doesn't seem right about a storm of that magnitude.
[02:37:17.275 --> 02:37:20.876]  We know in the past they have covered up the full magnitude.
[02:37:20.936 --> 02:37:21.716]  I don't know about this.
[02:37:21.736 --> 02:37:22.297]  It's too early.
[02:37:22.837 --> 02:37:31.180]  I'm sure we might have information on that, but I sent you the Pentagon flash player that was on your website.
[02:37:31.540 --> 02:37:32.401]  Yeah, we posted that.
[02:37:32.441 --> 02:37:32.721]  Thank you.
[02:37:33.143 --> 02:37:34.043]  Yeah, you're very welcome.
[02:37:34.063 --> 02:37:35.624]  I got that from a friend in California.
[02:37:35.944 --> 02:37:36.484]  Sent it to me.
[02:37:37.304 --> 02:37:45.326]  But I was really kind of curious about that morning, if they had heard anything about the death toll from these hurricanes, because the coverage is so poor.
[02:37:46.766 --> 02:37:49.206]  It just seems like there would be a lot more flooding than what they're showing.
[02:37:50.767 --> 02:37:54.087]  Well, I know the hurricane just sat over the state for over 24 hours.
[02:37:55.368 --> 02:38:01.769]  And being as already saturated ground, already been through a hurricane like that before, it used to cause massive flooding.
[02:38:02.571 --> 02:38:03.652]  When a second storm comes in.
[02:38:03.672 --> 02:38:10.559]  It'll be a nice... I mean, look, hurricanes naturally hit, but the government admits they have the power to take storms and intensify them.
[02:38:10.859 --> 02:38:12.641]  They at least have the power to do that.
[02:38:12.661 --> 02:38:13.362]  Thanks for the call.
[02:38:13.582 --> 02:38:14.102]  Oh, you're welcome.
[02:38:14.143 --> 02:38:14.443]  Thank you.
[02:38:14.483 --> 02:38:15.043]  You bet, sir.
[02:38:15.424 --> 02:38:16.845]  Now, Brooke in Rhode Island.
[02:38:17.125 --> 02:38:17.566]  Go ahead.
[02:38:18.387 --> 02:38:18.887]  Hey, Alex.
[02:38:19.488 --> 02:38:20.409]  This is Brooke.
[02:38:20.469 --> 02:38:22.431]  Michael Corbin did a great job for you.
[02:38:23.372 --> 02:38:26.575]  He's a terrific guy, and I thought he was a great co-host.
[02:38:27.593 --> 02:38:35.396]  But there is something I wanted to mention that I noticed about both conventions that I haven't heard anyone in the media discuss.
[02:38:36.716 --> 02:38:37.017]  Hello?
[02:38:37.617 --> 02:38:37.937]  Yes.
[02:38:39.417 --> 02:38:41.018]  There was no platform night.
[02:38:41.878 --> 02:38:43.819]  Neither party is running on a platform.
[02:38:44.989 --> 02:38:51.497]  In past conventions, in all past conventions I have watched, Tuesday night was always platform night.
[02:38:51.918 --> 02:38:54.361]  That's when the party hammered out the platform.
[02:38:54.701 --> 02:38:57.525]  That is when they discussed everything they were running on.
[02:38:58.130 --> 02:39:00.651]  And how they differed with the other party.
[02:39:00.711 --> 02:39:05.272]  Neither party had a platform night.
[02:39:05.592 --> 02:39:08.073]  Sir, you just made a massive point.
[02:39:08.533 --> 02:39:21.016]  They always, in the first or second night, would have debates, would have arguments, would bring up their platform, read their platform, but because the platform is always conservative and that embarrasses people, same with the Democrats,
[02:39:22.626 --> 02:39:24.228]  They didn't have a platform.
[02:39:24.248 --> 02:39:25.549]  You're absolutely right.
[02:39:25.989 --> 02:39:29.832]  No, and that means neither party is running on a platform.
[02:39:29.852 --> 02:39:38.540]  I have never seen anything like this, and nobody's brought this up, and I don't think I'm so smart, but I just kind of noticed this, and I said, what's going on here?
[02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:41.760]  No, you're absolutely right.
[02:39:41.800 --> 02:39:43.841]  We've got to write an article about that and point that out.
[02:39:43.861 --> 02:39:47.022]  This is the first time ever the Democrats didn't, and I've watched a lot of it.
[02:39:47.062 --> 02:39:47.642]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[02:39:47.682 --> 02:39:48.382]  Maybe they did have it.
[02:39:48.422 --> 02:39:51.523]  But I was there, and the Republicans did not have a platform.
[02:39:51.883 --> 02:39:53.484]  Yeah, that's what I was going to ask you.
[02:39:53.504 --> 02:39:56.344]  You were there, and I was going to say, did I miss something?
[02:39:56.464 --> 02:39:58.385]  Did you notice any platform?
[02:39:58.425 --> 02:39:58.825]  You know what?
[02:39:59.065 --> 02:39:59.665]  I was there.
[02:39:59.745 --> 02:40:00.365]  Thanks for the call.
[02:40:00.826 --> 02:40:02.306]  I was there Tuesday night.
[02:40:03.184 --> 02:40:09.089]  And they read in all of the delegates, and they said, all right, we now certify this.
[02:40:09.669 --> 02:40:10.610]  We now commence it.
[02:40:11.050 --> 02:40:12.371]  And there should have been a platform.
[02:40:12.512 --> 02:40:17.756]  I was sitting in the chair seconds before Schwarzenegger came out, and that's what they did.
[02:40:18.456 --> 02:40:19.317]  Great point.
[02:40:20.374 --> 02:40:23.498]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian.
[02:40:23.758 --> 02:40:24.659]  Paul in Delaware.
[02:40:24.719 --> 02:40:25.339]  Go ahead, Paul.
[02:40:25.760 --> 02:40:26.180]  Hi, Alex.
[02:40:26.200 --> 02:40:26.721]  How are you doing?
[02:40:26.801 --> 02:40:27.061]  Good.
[02:40:27.341 --> 02:40:30.184]  I really appreciate that you went to New York City.
[02:40:30.585 --> 02:40:33.187]  I just had a question for you and a small comment.
[02:40:33.227 --> 02:40:36.851]  But my first part was, is that the first big protest you've been to with like...
[02:40:37.329 --> 02:40:39.390]  Well, I've been to a couple other big demonstrations.
[02:40:39.430 --> 02:40:42.191]  Well, I said that, Paul, when I called in four times last week.
[02:40:42.471 --> 02:40:42.611]  Yeah.
[02:40:57.777 --> 02:41:04.699]  That being there, there were 10,000 signs handed out saying the government was involved in 9-11.
[02:41:05.100 --> 02:41:10.462]  Almost everybody I talked to knew that Kerry was controlled, that Bush is controlled, and that it's the New World Order.
[02:41:10.902 --> 02:41:14.863]  And I ran into at least 500 people while I was there that were listeners to this radio show.
[02:41:15.383 --> 02:41:19.285]  Yeah, and that's one thing that a lot of people that don't get a chance to go to protests find out.
[02:41:19.325 --> 02:41:21.005]  These people are well-educated.
[02:41:21.145 --> 02:41:24.667]  I mean, you know, you wouldn't think that they would know so many facts about 9-11.
[02:41:24.967 --> 02:41:25.947]  I was surprised when I went.
[02:41:26.559 --> 02:41:34.003]  My other point was, I listened to this show Coast to Coast for the first time, and I've heard callers calling about Coast to Coast.
[02:41:34.383 --> 02:41:40.426]  Man, the episode I heard, this guy's telling, he had a guest on telling little children how they could talk to dead people and talk to spirits.
[02:41:40.446 --> 02:41:44.348]  I'm like, is this what these people are talking about that call into your show?
[02:41:44.488 --> 02:41:45.048]  Oh my God.
[02:41:45.108 --> 02:41:46.069]  But I'll leave you with that.
[02:41:47.470 --> 02:41:47.730]  All right.
[02:41:47.750 --> 02:41:49.050]  Well, thank you for the call, Paul.
[02:41:49.110 --> 02:41:51.231]  Let's talk to John in New Jersey.
[02:41:51.332 --> 02:41:52.132]  John, go ahead.
[02:41:52.970 --> 02:41:53.710]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:41:53.750 --> 02:41:58.392]  I just wanted to know your take on the Russian situation, because it looks a little murky.
[02:41:58.432 --> 02:42:07.695]  I'm not sure, because you have Putin saying the third party and the Chechens are alluding to a third party, so I was just curious what your opinion on that was.
[02:42:08.196 --> 02:42:11.137]  Well, I saw the article that a caller, a few callers ago, mentioned.
[02:42:11.177 --> 02:42:16.039]  At least 15,000 women out front the Kremlin saying that the government was behind it.
[02:42:16.559 --> 02:42:18.219]  Putin comes out and says, how dare you?
[02:42:18.259 --> 02:42:19.560]  We're not going to have any type of...
[02:42:20.771 --> 02:42:22.891]  We're not going to have any type of investigation.
[02:42:23.391 --> 02:42:25.272]  First, they claim they killed all the terrorists.
[02:42:25.292 --> 02:42:29.012]  Then they claim that five of them, now eight of them, got away.
[02:42:30.513 --> 02:42:33.433]  Now it turns out the weapons were stored there beforehand.
[02:42:33.913 --> 02:42:37.594]  And all I know is Putin was caught blowing up three of his own buildings.
[02:42:38.014 --> 02:42:41.715]  Moscow police caught FSB and 99 planting bombs in a fourth building.
[02:42:42.195 --> 02:42:47.716]  We know that there was an inside job with a theater attack a few years ago in Moscow.
[02:42:48.116 --> 02:42:50.196]  This thing stinks to high heaven.
[02:42:51.365 --> 02:42:55.609]  Did you see the Henry Maycow article on his website?
[02:42:56.090 --> 02:42:56.590]  No, I didn't.
[02:42:57.431 --> 02:42:58.252]  Okay.
[02:42:58.372 --> 02:42:58.952]  It's interesting.
[02:42:59.353 --> 02:43:01.235]  I would suggest taking a look at it.
[02:43:01.655 --> 02:43:02.135]  Okay.
[02:43:02.296 --> 02:43:02.736]  I'll let you go.
[02:43:02.756 --> 02:43:03.096]  Thank you.
[02:43:03.397 --> 02:43:04.077]  Thank you for the call.
[02:43:04.117 --> 02:43:05.679]  I'm sorry I can't take any more calls.
[02:43:05.699 --> 02:43:07.441]  There's a few other news things I want to cover.
[02:43:07.801 --> 02:43:08.782]  Here's an email.
[02:43:11.369 --> 02:43:22.717]  And understand, the Russians will shut down media anywhere, but at this event, Fox News, Sky News, all these Western agencies were there as it happened.
[02:43:23.778 --> 02:43:25.559]  And they were left there the entire time.
[02:43:25.900 --> 02:43:27.601]  But independent media was all arrested.
[02:43:27.621 --> 02:43:28.261]  Now listen to this.
[02:43:29.162 --> 02:43:29.842]  This is an email.
[02:43:30.003 --> 02:43:30.343]  I don't...
[02:43:32.191 --> 02:43:32.571]  I don't.
[02:43:32.631 --> 02:43:33.852]  You may already have some.
[02:43:33.912 --> 02:43:34.432]  Whatever that means.
[02:43:34.452 --> 02:43:35.893]  I think part of the email got caught up.
[02:43:35.973 --> 02:43:42.397]  But I have a couple of hours of live footage from Sky News, BBC, ABC, Australia, and CNN London.
[02:43:42.837 --> 02:43:44.018]  Please mail it to me, sir.
[02:43:44.598 --> 02:43:52.503]  It is amazing the amount of contradictory evidence I saw that evening, such as, number one, officials say there are 18 terrorists.
[02:43:52.683 --> 02:44:00.588]  Escapees say there were at least 40, which leaves at least 14 unaccounted who were reported as escaping during the siege.
[02:44:01.599 --> 02:44:12.622]  Two, another report that said the Russian army blew a hole in the wall first is, have you noticed footage of the gym all rubble on the inside?
[02:44:13.022 --> 02:44:17.184]  That would suggest that the suicide bomber did not blow herself up first.
[02:44:18.104 --> 02:44:21.665]  The Russians even tried to say there were no injuries or fatalities.
[02:44:22.565 --> 02:44:24.646]  I watched the firefight for seven hours.
[02:44:24.766 --> 02:44:28.367]  Some were bigger than anything I've ever seen in Iraq.
[02:44:29.941 --> 02:44:30.925]  Less than airstrikes.
[02:44:31.106 --> 02:44:35.422]  But the Russians felt it necessary to use T-72 tanks and Hein gunships.
[02:44:36.872 --> 02:44:43.317]  Yet how did they get so much ordinance into the school to sustain such a heavy firefight so skillfully and for so long?
[02:44:43.577 --> 02:44:50.321]  I have never heard of any LCA to terrorists being able to sustain such a firefight against an entire Russian division.
[02:44:50.782 --> 02:44:54.905]  Yeah, a seven-hour firefight with hines and tanks shooting into the building.
[02:44:54.925 --> 02:44:56.005]  That's real good for the children.
[02:44:56.025 --> 02:44:57.066]  It's like Waco.
[02:44:57.086 --> 02:44:58.647]  To save the children, they set it on fire.
[02:44:59.148 --> 02:45:01.569]  How could they be so well-armed and so well-trained?
[02:45:02.410 --> 02:45:05.372]  Two naked bodies were thrown into the crowd to be lynched.
[02:45:05.942 --> 02:45:10.704]  I have a Sky News live report about this, and the Army stands by and lets them.
[02:45:11.484 --> 02:45:14.866]  Not one ambulance arrived for 30 minutes of the footage I watched.
[02:45:14.946 --> 02:45:15.466]  Not one.
[02:45:16.066 --> 02:45:20.248]  And on and on with the contradictions, a strange behavior, and comments.
[02:45:20.368 --> 02:45:25.891]  Anything, if you would like me to send a copy of the material I taped, I would be more than happy to.
[02:45:26.291 --> 02:45:27.111]  Regards, Peter.
[02:45:27.531 --> 02:45:29.372]  Yes, Peter, please mail it all to me.
[02:45:29.432 --> 02:45:33.674]  I would be extremely thankful for that if you would do that.
[02:45:34.861 --> 02:45:36.381]  Okay, now let's get into Bin Laden.
[02:45:37.482 --> 02:45:40.383]  And more will come out on this whole school situation.
[02:45:40.423 --> 02:45:42.003]  My heart goes out to everybody.
[02:45:42.023 --> 02:45:52.926]  I mean, we got Bush and his national TV ad that's been airing for a month where he's sitting there with his wife and he says, I don't know what to do with a terror attack if I had to pick up only one of my children and had to choose.
[02:45:53.766 --> 02:45:58.888]  Then days after that, oh, the woman had to pick one of her children, had to choose.
[02:45:58.968 --> 02:46:00.308]  I mean, it's really getting bad.
[02:46:01.428 --> 02:46:04.049]  Of all the things Bush could say, he says that, and then it happens.
[02:46:05.515 --> 02:46:06.896]  This is out of Detroit Free Press.
[02:46:07.497 --> 02:46:10.220]  Probes redefine Bin Laden's role.
[02:46:10.320 --> 02:46:13.463]  Al-Qaeda seems to operate without his fortune, they find.
[02:46:14.084 --> 02:46:18.648]  This is setting it up for the stage capture so that Al-Qaeda can go on after Bin Laden's captured.
[02:46:19.149 --> 02:46:21.992]  They're now removing him as the boogeyman and going to give us a new boogeyman.
[02:46:22.694 --> 02:46:33.461]  A recent investigation into Al-Qaeda by September 11th Commission and others have altered the commonly held view that bin Laden's inheritance and massive fortunes, estimated $300 million at one point, were used to finance his operations.
[02:46:33.881 --> 02:46:40.485]  It's also believed that a network of businesses in Sudan, his base from 1991 to 1996, is not backing Al-Qaeda.
[02:46:40.925 --> 02:46:43.947]  They offered to arrest him in 1998 in Clinton Cruise Missile Dome.
[02:46:46.346 --> 02:46:53.148]  James Baker's representing the Saudis against the families of 9-11 victims, so that's why the 9-11 Commission's saying bin Laden wasn't involved now.
[02:46:54.808 --> 02:46:57.349]  So now they're telling you he's not the boogeyman we thought.
[02:46:57.909 --> 02:46:58.529]  Here's another one.
[02:46:58.629 --> 02:46:58.930]  U.S.
[02:46:58.970 --> 02:47:07.052]  near-seizing bin Laden official says Islamabad, Pakistan, AP, the United States and its allies have moved closer to capturing a son of bin Laden.
[02:47:07.312 --> 02:47:08.612]  In the last two months, a top U.S.
[02:47:08.652 --> 02:47:11.913]  counterterrorism official said the television interview broadcast Saturday.
[02:47:13.220 --> 02:47:16.563]  If he has a watch, he should be looking at it because the clock is ticking.
[02:47:16.864 --> 02:47:19.627]  He will be caught, Joseph Koffer Black, the U.S.
[02:47:19.647 --> 02:47:24.992]  State Department coordinator for counterterrorism told Private Geo Television Network.
[02:47:25.552 --> 02:47:28.235]  Ask of concrete progress has been made during the last two months.
[02:47:28.696 --> 02:47:33.000]  Pakistan has arrested dozens of terror suspects, including some key AL-CIA operatives.
[02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:34.902]  Black said, yes, I would say this.
[02:47:35.734 --> 02:47:39.236]  Paul Watson, my webmaster, you need to take this article and save it.
[02:47:39.696 --> 02:47:50.603]  Under it, post the airlift of evil articles, Times of London, BBC, Reuters, where 8,000 Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders were flown out by our government in safety in the middle of the Afghan war.
[02:47:51.323 --> 02:47:56.246]  And you need to post where I said two and a half years ago they'd stay just captured before the election.
[02:47:56.486 --> 02:47:58.167]  My inside White House source told me.
[02:47:58.947 --> 02:47:59.968]  And you need to post...
[02:48:00.848 --> 02:48:11.412]  The BBC article from two months before 9-11 when they reported that British ambassadors were in the northern area of Pakistan and saw bin Laden, quote, being protected by U.S.
[02:48:11.432 --> 02:48:12.372]  special forces.
[02:48:12.932 --> 02:48:23.156]  And we need to post the Le Figaro and Washington Times article about the CIA meeting with bin Laden on his deathbed in July before the 9-11 attacks, staging this whole thing.
[02:48:23.896 --> 02:48:29.738]  Got to put a data page together on this immediately to break people's conditioning.
[02:48:30.666 --> 02:48:33.849]  We'll come back and get into some more news in the final segment.
[02:48:33.889 --> 02:48:36.131]  I'm Alex Jones going 90 miles an hour.
[02:48:36.991 --> 02:48:43.277]  Please stay with us as we expose the New World Order orchestration of terror to scare you into submission.

[02:48:52.492 --> 02:48:53.873]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:54.053 --> 02:48:56.254]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:56.414 --> 02:48:58.516]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.

[02:52:02.655 --> 02:52:06.276]  But first, here's Bush and Kerry with Freudian slips just a few months ago.
[02:52:06.296 --> 02:52:07.836]  And there's new Freudian slips every week.
[02:52:07.876 --> 02:52:08.316]  Here it is.
[02:52:12.577 --> 02:52:13.878]  Oh, she's still saving the file.
[02:52:13.918 --> 02:52:15.018]  We lost it and had to refine it.
[02:52:15.038 --> 02:52:16.478]  We'll play it at the end of the show here in a minute.
[02:52:17.399 --> 02:52:18.339]  Here's the announcement.
[02:52:19.600 --> 02:52:22.502]  Tomorrow night, 6.30, is a key juncture.
[02:52:23.062 --> 02:52:29.566]  They admit now they're taking over the free speech and taking over the AXS TV channels and privatizing them and doing all of this.
[02:52:29.666 --> 02:52:32.608]  A key fight where they're going to try to certify it.
[02:52:32.748 --> 02:52:36.330]  Members of the City Council and the Austin Music Commission are meeting tomorrow night.
[02:52:38.153 --> 02:52:39.013]  6.30, I'm going to be there.
[02:52:39.173 --> 02:52:40.214]  Please be there.
[02:52:40.234 --> 02:52:41.035]  No excuses.
[02:52:41.175 --> 02:52:41.935]  It's after work.
[02:52:42.356 --> 02:52:43.637]  Bring your children, whatever.
[02:52:44.037 --> 02:52:48.320]  Sign up to speak or give me your time to speak so I can speak longer and expose this.
[02:52:48.400 --> 02:52:51.722]  Corporate takeover, a birthplace of Axis Television reaching critical juncture.
[02:52:52.063 --> 02:52:53.884]  This is a very important meeting on Wednesday.
[02:52:54.733 --> 02:52:55.733]  We're good to go.
[02:53:17.665 --> 02:53:24.051]  You can link through on Infowars.com to our press release, link through to the city of Austin for directions and exactly where it's at.
[02:53:24.412 --> 02:53:31.159]  Tomorrow, 6.30 at night, 1 Texas Center, 505 Barton Springs Road, room 325.
[02:53:31.599 --> 02:53:32.059]  Be there!
[02:53:32.880 --> 02:53:34.562]  I file legal action against them.
[02:53:34.622 --> 02:53:35.543]  It's a serious fight.
[02:53:35.563 --> 02:53:36.404]  We need to see you there.
[02:53:37.236 --> 02:53:41.280]  Again, that's 1 Texas Center, 505 Barton Springs Road, room 325.
[02:53:42.141 --> 02:53:48.066]  It's a big tan building right beside Threadgills in downtown Austin on the south side of the river.
[02:53:48.106 --> 02:53:48.887]  You cannot miss it.
[02:53:48.907 --> 02:53:51.630]  505 Barton Springs Road, room 325.
[02:53:51.930 --> 02:53:54.132]  Go ahead and hit that clip now.
[02:53:54.733 --> 02:53:59.234]  We will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[02:53:59.394 --> 02:54:02.275]  Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we.
[02:54:02.555 --> 02:54:06.596]  They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we.
[02:54:06.697 --> 02:54:11.198]  We will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[02:54:11.318 --> 02:54:14.219]  Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we.
[02:54:14.479 --> 02:54:18.440]  They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we.
[02:54:19.272 --> 02:54:20.332]  Wow, the truth comes out.
[02:54:20.412 --> 02:54:21.653]  Alright, this is from Reuters.
[02:54:21.773 --> 02:54:23.654]  Vatican Cardinal says terrorism is new.
[02:54:24.114 --> 02:54:24.754]  World War.
[02:54:24.914 --> 02:54:26.294]  Rights should be sacrificed.
[02:54:26.314 --> 02:54:27.375]  We should give up our rights.
[02:54:28.835 --> 02:54:29.456]  I disagree.
[02:54:30.096 --> 02:54:33.257]  Audience boos as Bush offers best wishes for Clinton recovery.
[02:54:33.357 --> 02:54:33.757]  AP.
[02:54:34.237 --> 02:54:38.959]  Well, why would you cheer Schwarzenegger as liberal or more than Clinton, but boo Clinton?
[02:54:39.819 --> 02:54:40.979]  I mean, why would you do that?
[02:54:41.780 --> 02:54:43.420]  And both of these men like cocaine.
[02:54:43.480 --> 02:54:48.262]  I mean, why does Bush want to put your child in jail for using cocaine, but he uses cocaine?
[02:54:48.917 --> 02:54:51.379]  Damage from Francis could be $15 billion.
[02:54:51.479 --> 02:54:52.079]  Unbelievable.
[02:54:53.400 --> 02:54:55.321]  Dispute over identity of terror group.
[02:54:55.361 --> 02:54:56.462]  This is out of the Straits Times.
[02:54:56.502 --> 02:55:03.306]  Confusion reigns over the identity of the group that seized a school in North Osseti, taking hostages more than 1,000 children and adults.
[02:55:03.346 --> 02:55:04.527]  Now over 300 have died.
[02:55:05.727 --> 02:55:08.349]  Again, the Mirror reporting Bush took cocaine at Camp David.
[02:55:09.550 --> 02:55:12.812]  Bush aides knew of Israeli spy ring and said that they didn't care.
[02:55:14.201 --> 02:55:16.222]  Just didn't care they were in the Pentagon doing this.
[02:55:16.722 --> 02:55:20.464]  Well, I mean, Israel said that they'll kill American citizens in America, and Bush says that's fine.
[02:55:20.705 --> 02:55:22.265]  That's UPI two years ago.
[02:55:23.426 --> 02:55:30.270]  And just a bunch of other key news here, my friends, that is just all so important.
[02:55:30.290 --> 02:55:35.232]  And they're cracking down on journalists in Iraq, American journalists killing them, beating them up, arresting them.
[02:55:35.553 --> 02:55:37.314]  And it almost got that bad in New York.
[02:55:37.354 --> 02:55:39.655]  I mean, no free speech, no nothing.
[02:55:40.670 --> 02:55:44.431]  I was threatened with arrest three times a day, taken into custody a couple times, detained.
[02:55:45.191 --> 02:55:49.412]  A big poll, San Francisco Chronicle, young people fear return of the draft.
[02:55:49.452 --> 02:55:50.812]  Yeah, because they've introduced the bills.
[02:55:52.773 --> 02:55:54.933]  We are out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:54.973 --> 02:55:58.554]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:55:58.874 --> 02:56:01.575]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2, and I'll see you tomorrow night.
[02:56:02.135 --> 02:56:04.596]  Please put it down in your calendar.
[02:56:04.656 --> 02:56:05.636]  Be there tomorrow night, 6.30 p.m.
[02:56:07.049 --> 02:56:11.251]  At 1 Texas Center, 505 Barton Springs Road, room 325.
[02:56:11.711 --> 02:56:15.973]  They're shutting access down all over the country.
[02:56:16.013 --> 02:56:17.794]  Just shut it down in Indianapolis, Indiana.
[02:56:18.194 --> 02:56:19.835]  Shut it down in Denver, Colorado, Houston.
[02:56:20.175 --> 02:56:21.076]  It's happening everywhere.
[02:56:21.116 --> 02:56:25.118]  We've got to have this so they don't have a monopoly over the media so we can counter them.
[02:56:25.158 --> 02:56:27.519]  So fight for it in your area and use it.
[02:56:27.759 --> 02:56:31.381]  And I'll see you tomorrow night at 6.30 and back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:31.421 --> 02:56:31.781]  God bless.
