[00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:06.150]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.831 --> 00:00:07.871]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:09.692]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.353 --> 00:00:11.213]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.934 --> 00:00:12.834]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:17.276]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.677 --> 00:00:21.799]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.442 --> 00:00:31.444]  Cutting through the disinformation, cutting through the confusion.
[00:00:32.717 --> 00:00:40.801]  Engaging in real talk radio, real issues of true significance that actually affect you and your family.
[00:00:43.383 --> 00:00:44.443]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:44.843 --> 00:00:51.087]  It is already Tuesday, the 16th day of November 2004.
[00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:53.568]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:53.628 --> 00:00:55.489]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:57.410]  until 2 p.m.
[00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.432]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.961]  Central Standard Time.
[00:01:02.981 --> 00:01:07.124]  You can listen to us on a great list of AM and FM stations across the country.
[00:01:07.545 --> 00:01:12.909]  Simulcasting on the Internet at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.655]  And, of course, on global shortwave during the day at 9.985 WWCR.
[00:01:20.155 --> 00:01:23.438]  The big 100,000 watt shortwave blowtorch.
[00:01:23.558 --> 00:01:27.161]  And back from 9 to midnight Central on WWCR at 3210.
[00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:40.974]  as well as on some of your home satellite systems and there's a lot of different ways to listen and it's also posted there at GCNlive.com, the network website.
[00:01:42.595 --> 00:01:56.961]  Brett Beckman, the grandfather of the fully informed jury movement in this country, really the grandfather of the court reform movement in this country, military veteran in his own right, been pretty ill the last year but a little bit better now.
[00:01:57.754 --> 00:02:00.795]  He's going to be joining us in the second hour.
[00:02:02.095 --> 00:02:08.896]  So we're honored to have this amazing crusader joining us coming up in the second hour.
[00:02:11.597 --> 00:02:13.578]  There is so much news and information.
[00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:16.918]  Obviously, everybody's talking about Condoleezza Rice.
[00:02:17.038 --> 00:02:17.678]  Who cares?
[00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.019]  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
[00:02:21.713 --> 00:02:22.834]  Powell was no different.
[00:02:22.854 --> 00:02:27.278]  He would just play the part of good cop occasionally so that he could come at the last minute and go, Yes!
[00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:28.499]  Saddam's evil!
[00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:29.480]  He's with Al-Qaeda!
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.101]  Get him!
[00:02:30.181 --> 00:02:31.783]  Here's the anthrax vial!
[00:02:33.304 --> 00:02:39.550]  Everybody's talking about the video of this Marine blowing somebody's head off.
[00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:48.955]  Sounded like and looked like the video we've seen of gang members blowing people's heads off and some people are saying, hey, good!
[00:02:48.975 --> 00:02:50.876]  These people aren't human they're killing!
[00:02:51.276 --> 00:02:51.696]  Kill them!
[00:02:51.736 --> 00:02:52.096]  Kill them!
[00:02:52.677 --> 00:02:54.658]  Isn't that what the Arabs say about us?
[00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.340]  See, both sides are turning into animals here.
[00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:01.042]  And I'm tired of the double think.
[00:03:01.642 --> 00:03:05.244]  It's wrong when they take one of our injured troops and blow their head off.
[00:03:06.345 --> 00:03:10.027]  And it's wrong when the military
[00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:13.395]  And I want to say our military, because it's openly the Pentagon.
[00:03:13.415 --> 00:03:16.517]  I got the Pentagon on tape saying, quote, you don't work for the American people.
[00:03:16.857 --> 00:03:18.458]  You work for the global corporations.
[00:03:19.258 --> 00:03:22.540]  I got that Professor Barnett at the Pentagon saying it.
[00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:27.903]  And it's wrong when they go out and blow some person's head off.
[00:03:29.244 --> 00:03:30.824]  It was wrong when the Nazis did it.
[00:03:31.265 --> 00:03:33.005]  It was wrong when Fidel Castro did it.
[00:03:33.406 --> 00:03:35.707]  It was wrong when the North Vietnamese did it to our troops.
[00:03:37.043 --> 00:03:42.267]  And it was wrong at the Mille Massacre, when our troops did it, and it's wrong now.
[00:03:42.467 --> 00:03:43.628]  We got the audio of this.
[00:03:44.588 --> 00:03:46.289]  We'll bleep out the cuss words.
[00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.191]  We'll be playing it.
[00:03:48.591 --> 00:03:50.793]  NBC won't show the actual head blowing off.
[00:03:52.214 --> 00:03:54.355]  They admit they've cut that out.
[00:03:56.416 --> 00:03:59.439]  But how do we even know this guy's an insurgent, to begin with?
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.841]  By the way, it is their country.
[00:04:03.473 --> 00:04:06.114]  In the psychology of how dare them fight!
[00:04:06.214 --> 00:04:07.734]  I mean, we're bringing them freedom!
[00:04:08.074 --> 00:04:11.855]  Why, we're installing the Ba'athist Party again in charge, that they hate!
[00:04:13.576 --> 00:04:17.097]  How dare them evil Shiites, who've been our allies all along!
[00:04:17.117 --> 00:04:18.117]  Well, they're evil!
[00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:19.618]  And kill them, too!
[00:04:20.718 --> 00:04:21.898]  Light them up and shoot them!
[00:04:22.218 --> 00:04:26.700]  Man, I heard talk radio this morning... They're animals!
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.260]  Kill them!
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.400]  These aren't human beings!
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.881]  I mean, I'm actually hearing Nazi nomenclature!
[00:04:33.769 --> 00:04:35.030]  No, they're human beings.
[00:04:36.171 --> 00:04:36.891]  They really are.
[00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:38.032]  I know that's a radical statement.
[00:04:40.153 --> 00:04:42.155]  But I see Psy-Ops written all over this.
[00:04:42.275 --> 00:04:45.417]  NBC doesn't release anything without Pentagon approval.
[00:04:45.777 --> 00:04:46.438]  They're embedded.
[00:04:46.458 --> 00:04:49.760]  This has been done on purpose.
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.723]  Just like Abu Ghraib, CIA took those photos and released them.
[00:04:55.323 --> 00:04:56.804]  This whole thing is Psy-Ops.
[00:04:56.824 --> 00:04:57.445]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:09.747]  The media is flooded with reports of everything from antibiotic resistant super germs to the possibility of a flu epidemic due to a vaccine shortage.
[00:05:10.107 --> 00:05:14.790]  If we can't rely on traditional medicines, what are you going to do to keep you and your family healthy and safe?
[00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:18.874]  There is now a scientifically proven alternative called Super Silver Solution.
[00:05:19.114 --> 00:05:22.056]  Super Silver is a combination of supercharged silver and oxygen.
[00:05:22.356 --> 00:05:29.223]  has been proven to kill hundreds of bacteria and be at least two to three hundred percent more effective than any other silver product.
[00:05:29.483 --> 00:05:38.051]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[00:05:38.372 --> 00:05:44.678]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.
[00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:48.359]  Call International Health for your free audio information package at 1-800-974-1879.
[00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:49.680]  We're so sure it works, we guarantee it.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.820]  That's 1-800-974-1879 or visit supersilver.net.
[00:06:01.195 --> 00:06:04.477]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:04.517 --> 00:06:08.740]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.762]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:11.942 --> 00:06:14.344]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:14.524 --> 00:06:23.169]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:24.710]  The Brookie Light is different.
[00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.053]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:06:29.133 --> 00:06:29.834]  We're good to go.
[00:06:59.413 --> 00:07:02.175]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:05.457]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:07:05.577 --> 00:07:09.499]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:13.782]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:07:14.122 --> 00:07:17.885]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:07:18.025 --> 00:07:19.926]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:07:20.026 --> 00:07:23.368]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:07:23.408 --> 00:07:24.469]  The medical bills!
[00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.113]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:07:28.253 --> 00:07:31.297]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:07:31.457 --> 00:07:34.341]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:40.949]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:45.252]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:07:45.653 --> 00:07:47.034]  Order your video today.
[00:07:47.374 --> 00:07:48.455]  Call toll-free at 888-253-3139.
[00:07:48.475 --> 00:07:50.457]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[00:07:50.477 --> 00:07:51.638]  Or go to my website, Infowars.com.
[00:07:51.858 --> 00:07:53.919]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:21.872 --> 00:08:22.953]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:08:23.093 --> 00:08:26.375]  It is Tuesday, again, the 16th day of November 04.
[00:08:27.095 --> 00:08:48.449]  Red Buckman, really the forefather of the court reform movement, jury reform, Fully Informed Jury Association, the acknowledged grandfather of it all, one of the founding members of the movement against the criminal 16th Amendment and the fraudulent IRS,
[00:08:49.591 --> 00:08:58.377]  He's the father of many moderate movements and he's been very ill the last year but now he's up and running again and we're going to have Red Beckman on in the next hour.
[00:09:00.798 --> 00:09:05.181]  Let me get into this first because I kind of dropped the ball yesterday because I'm just so sick of it.
[00:09:05.221 --> 00:09:06.782]  I only talked about it for a few minutes.
[00:09:07.522 --> 00:09:10.885]  I should have spent a lot more time on it.
[00:09:10.905 --> 00:09:16.108]  60 Minutes Sunday has this disgruntled supposed CIA officer who's resigned
[00:09:16.986 --> 00:09:40.309]  From the Central Intelligence Agency and why he's got inside info, Al-Qaeda headed up by Osama bin Tim Osman, that's his CIA code name, Tim Osman, has gotten a cleric's authorization to use a dirty bomb or a nuclear device, an A-bomb, a hydrogen bomb, who knows what, on America!
[00:09:42.762 --> 00:09:46.986]  And George Bush did nothing to warn the American people.
[00:09:49.008 --> 00:09:53.693]  Meanwhile, Bush has got his people out saying, the CIA let 9-11 happen!
[00:09:54.253 --> 00:09:57.156]  Let me totally take it over and run it out of the White House!
[00:09:58.097 --> 00:10:07.066]  So it does seem like there is some type of internal war going on between the CIA, at least some factions of it, and Lord Bush.
[00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.551]  That's on the surface, my friends.
[00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:28.265]  There is no war going on, other than the fact that there are a lot of good people in the CIA, a lot of good analysts and others, who have been angry about being ordered to put out lies about Iraq and other fraudulent, manufactured analyses on the world.
[00:10:30.146 --> 00:10:35.270]  Because, then after they put out the disinfo, they're blamed with it, and Bush says, oh, it's their fault.
[00:10:36.684 --> 00:10:48.806]  So really all that's happening is Bush is reorganizing the CIA under Porter Goss, who was an insider on 9-11, under his centralized controls to an even greater degree.
[00:10:49.226 --> 00:10:56.008]  They've always had the top compartments under New World Order control, now they're just running out the few people that weren't under their control.
[00:10:56.488 --> 00:11:04.169]  So there's a purge going on in the empire of some of the people who aren't energetic enough about destroying this country.
[00:11:05.422 --> 00:11:07.183]  Oh, by the way, you doubt that?
[00:11:07.963 --> 00:11:08.263]  U.S.
[00:11:08.303 --> 00:11:21.767]  News and World Report yesterday had the Bush White House telling them that, well, we're getting rid of a bunch of people in the cabinet, like Ashcroft and Powell and others, because they're not energetic enough about putting into place our policies.
[00:11:23.668 --> 00:11:28.849]  They're not energetic enough, so I guess they don't enjoy enough dismantling this country.
[00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:34.331]  And so we have Time Magazine with bordering on nukes, new accounts from Al-Qaeda,
[00:11:35.345 --> 00:11:36.366]  To attack the U.S.
[00:11:36.406 --> 00:11:44.557]  with weapons of mass destruction, a key Al-Qaeda operative seized in Pakistan recently offered an alarming account of the group's potential plans to target U.S.
[00:11:44.577 --> 00:11:46.800]  with weapons of mass destruction, senior U.S.
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.182]  security officials tell TIME.
[00:11:49.554 --> 00:12:06.599]  Sharif al-Massari, an Egyptian who was captured late August near Pakistan's border with Iran and Afghanistan, is told his interrogators of Al-Qaeda's interest in moving nuclear materials from Europe to either the US or Mexico, according to a report circulating among US government officials.
[00:12:08.119 --> 00:12:09.260]  Well, let's stop right there.
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.941]  We've got about 20 cases.
[00:12:12.021 --> 00:12:13.341]  I was looking this up last night.
[00:12:14.099 --> 00:12:33.633]  On PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com mainstream admissions where they bust so-called Al-Qaeda operatives and then quietly release them six months later and it's admitted, oh no, they were really CIA double agents and we were just staging their arrest to protect them from the people they were reporting on.
[00:12:37.856 --> 00:12:38.737]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:12:42.199 --> 00:12:42.900]  And then of course,
[00:12:44.321 --> 00:12:51.465]  We've got Bill Gertz out saying, oh, Chechenians with suitcase nukes may be coming across the Mexico border from Arizona into Arizona.
[00:12:53.647 --> 00:12:57.549]  We've got these reports that, oh, they may be in Mexico right now with the nukes.
[00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:00.511]  Number one, that is a total fraud.
[00:13:00.531 --> 00:13:01.571]  And why is it a fraud?
[00:13:02.512 --> 00:13:04.373]  For at least 30 years.
[00:13:05.114 --> 00:13:06.334]  This is now declassified.
[00:13:07.195 --> 00:13:13.799]  They've got satellites in orbit that can see just normal uranium deposits
[00:13:14.631 --> 00:13:31.376]  Forget enriched deposits, that is bombs, just normal deposits of uranium, plutonium, the satellites can look hundreds of feet into the ground and see those molecules there, of the element.
[00:13:33.724 --> 00:13:40.012]  And they admit that a nuclear bomb, a dirty bomb, it all stands out in different color arrays.
[00:13:40.372 --> 00:13:42.054]  They can see every x-ray machine.
[00:13:42.415 --> 00:13:43.596]  They can see everything.
[00:13:43.916 --> 00:13:45.658]  They've got a total picture of it.
[00:13:45.719 --> 00:13:50.384]  They know where every single nuclear weapon and
[00:13:50.404 --> 00:14:09.388]  And every radiological device, from a chest x-ray core, up to the biggest, fattest hydrogen bomb, to neutron bombs, to antimatter bombs, that our loving governments develop, now admitted, they know where it all is, exactly where it's at.
[00:14:13.487 --> 00:14:18.836]  And they admittedly have scores of helicopters flying around looking for these things as well, not just the satellites.
[00:14:18.896 --> 00:14:22.281]  So, I am... Look, if a nuke goes off, folks...
[00:14:23.266 --> 00:14:23.846]  They did it.
[00:14:24.486 --> 00:14:25.607]  It is a fact.
[00:14:26.187 --> 00:14:27.667]  It is documented.
[00:14:28.187 --> 00:14:31.268]  And they are now preparing us for one of these things to go off.
[00:14:31.628 --> 00:14:42.391]  And I want you to know, if it does go off, if we're not able to expose them and stop them, and they do kill a couple hundred thousand people, there's even a good-sized A-bomb going off at point-blank range.
[00:14:42.431 --> 00:14:45.792]  It isn't as devastating as, you know, one drop with an airburst.
[00:14:46.792 --> 00:14:48.133]  That's what causes real devastation.
[00:14:48.333 --> 00:14:49.653]  But still, hundreds of thousands will die.
[00:14:50.815 --> 00:14:54.377]  And a whole city will be a radiological dump for hundreds of years.
[00:14:54.977 --> 00:15:07.644]  Because when you detonate one of these things, and it combines with the different elements on the ground, and different metals on the ground, it way ups the yield of the radiological fallout in the half-life.
[00:15:09.944 --> 00:15:25.613]  And don't think they won't do it to radically re-engineer our whole society into a total police state, where the whole economy is fed through the hands of a few elite families, and everything goes into implantable microchips under the skin, and the total New World Order police state, and national drafts, and total empire and world government.
[00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:34.798]  9-11 is just a setup to set the police state up, bigger attacks are coming, and that's Gary Hart saying that, that's the CFR saying it, it's all these people.
[00:15:35.039 --> 00:15:39.161]  So they come out and create this story, starting a decade ago with Alexander Leavitt.
[00:15:40.795 --> 00:15:43.556]  Oh, there's this missing 122 suitcase nukes.
[00:15:43.936 --> 00:15:45.156]  Oh, they're going to get us any minute.
[00:15:45.516 --> 00:15:46.716]  Oh, Al Qaeda's got it.
[00:15:47.096 --> 00:15:48.817]  Oh no, Bush won't do anything about it.
[00:15:48.837 --> 00:15:52.318]  This is pure propaganda coming out of the White House.
[00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:56.278]  You know, they have some trusted guy who's now blown the whistle on them.
[00:15:56.678 --> 00:15:59.019]  Oh, he's saying the same thing Dick Cheney and George Bush are saying.
[00:15:59.299 --> 00:15:59.999]  Fear mongering.
[00:16:00.299 --> 00:16:03.680]  Give up all your rights or you're going to get nuked any minute.
[00:16:04.941 --> 00:16:12.105]  Again, the admitted facts are they know where everything radiological is.
[00:16:14.227 --> 00:16:18.809]  That dental office down the street from you that's got the x-rays for the jaw.
[00:16:21.251 --> 00:16:22.551]  Medium power x-ray.
[00:16:23.132 --> 00:16:27.654]  That baby shows up as a little blip on the satellite.
[00:16:28.175 --> 00:16:30.216]  There is no way to shield it.
[00:16:30.874 --> 00:16:32.795]  It sees right through lead.
[00:16:33.196 --> 00:16:34.657]  It sees right through vaults.
[00:16:34.997 --> 00:16:37.899]  It sees through hundreds of feet of solid rock.
[00:16:38.679 --> 00:16:41.841]  They know where everything is.
[00:16:42.062 --> 00:16:43.122]  It's a joke!
[00:16:46.545 --> 00:16:51.548]  And I wonder after they blow up a city, and I just know it's going to happen, unfortunately.
[00:16:51.688 --> 00:16:52.268]  Oh, no.
[00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:54.090]  I mean, I've been pretty freaked out lately.
[00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:55.631]  You can just see the writing on the wall.
[00:16:57.532 --> 00:16:58.713]  When they pull this,
[00:17:01.616 --> 00:17:10.360]  It'll just be like WTC 7, where all the scientists go, uh, even non-hardened junk steel doesn't heat up and start melting until 3,000 degrees.
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.301]  Jet fuel burns at 1,200.
[00:17:14.862 --> 00:17:16.523]  Building 7 wasn't hit by anything.
[00:17:16.803 --> 00:17:17.443]  No jet fuel.
[00:17:17.644 --> 00:17:21.806]  How did a few fires, small office fires do that?
[00:17:22.186 --> 00:17:23.366]  You know, the science won't matter.
[00:17:23.406 --> 00:17:28.909]  It'll be shut up when we say, uh, they got satellites and helicopters and blimps.
[00:17:29.545 --> 00:17:36.429]  With devices that see all this, it doesn't make sense.
[00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:40.292]  They should have, Italy, well, we just missed it.
[00:17:40.632 --> 00:17:41.833]  Give us more power.
[00:17:41.973 --> 00:17:43.614]  Next time we won't mess up.
[00:17:46.596 --> 00:17:48.037]  And the military knows this.
[00:17:48.077 --> 00:17:49.578]  The people at NORAD know this.
[00:17:49.638 --> 00:17:51.039]  The people at NASA know this.
[00:17:51.059 --> 00:17:52.560]  The people at Space Command know this.
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.921]  By the way, Space Command is now over the entire military.
[00:17:54.981 --> 00:17:55.902]  NORTHCOM, all of it.
[00:17:56.422 --> 00:17:58.924]  The average American doesn't even know what Space Command is.
[00:17:59.767 --> 00:18:03.648]  The average American doesn't know what the Pan-American Union is, the Free Trade Area of the Americas is.
[00:18:04.048 --> 00:18:07.009]  And I'm not sitting here going, the average American doesn't know, but I do.
[00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:11.331]  It freaks me out that people don't even know about the government that we're under.
[00:18:14.872 --> 00:18:23.015]  Meanwhile, we've got this video of three guys in a mosque, and they don't think one of them is too injured.
[00:18:23.115 --> 00:18:24.495]  Troops had been there the day before.
[00:18:25.315 --> 00:18:26.916]  Don't even know if they were insurgents.
[00:18:28.658 --> 00:18:31.640]  And they just walk over and make a joke and blow the guy's head off.
[00:18:33.542 --> 00:18:36.504]  And then I hear neocons going, oh, these people aren't even human.
[00:18:37.225 --> 00:18:37.685]  So what?
[00:18:37.725 --> 00:18:40.927]  Well, number one, why did NBC release that video?
[00:18:41.028 --> 00:18:41.888]  Everything's embedded.
[00:18:42.108 --> 00:18:43.990]  They don't release anything before it's screened.
[00:18:45.431 --> 00:18:48.413]  The answer is it's meant to enrage the Arabs further.
[00:18:48.433 --> 00:18:50.935]  Part of the P2OG Pentagon plan.
[00:18:52.116 --> 00:18:58.361]  It's meant to widen the war because the war goes on longer and is widened and the globalists make more money and have a bigger pretext.
[00:18:59.344 --> 00:19:03.906]  And domestically, it's meant to condition us that, oh, it's okay to line people up and shoot them.
[00:19:04.826 --> 00:19:13.429]  Just like CBS released the CIA photographs that they had everybody pose for while they tortured and raped and killed people.
[00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:17.071]  And then domestically, we're taught that that's okay.
[00:19:17.591 --> 00:19:20.612]  And then internationally, we're all meant to look like the bad guys, and the U.N.'
[00:19:20.592 --> 00:19:23.133]  's meant to look like the good guy, and it enrages the Arabs.
[00:19:23.393 --> 00:19:25.454]  It's just 101 psychological warfare.
[00:19:28.331 --> 00:19:30.931]  Now ask yourselves, why the Pentagon allowed the release of this video?
[00:19:33.432 --> 00:19:37.593]  Why is the Marine Corps encouraging their troops to defend this guy?
[00:19:38.233 --> 00:19:38.813]  It's sick!
[00:19:40.413 --> 00:19:41.153]  Well, they're animals.
[00:19:41.173 --> 00:19:41.873]  Alex, kill them.
[00:19:42.033 --> 00:19:45.214]  Wait a minute, I thought they're animals because they shoot our injured people.
[00:19:46.734 --> 00:19:48.575]  I thought Joseph Mengele was back as you did.
[00:19:49.515 --> 00:19:50.995]  I thought Saddam was back.
[00:19:51.115 --> 00:19:52.275]  Well, he's our boy.
[00:19:52.595 --> 00:19:54.095]  Just start having a brain.
[00:19:55.436 --> 00:19:56.816]  Start having the total view.
[00:19:58.123 --> 00:19:58.883]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:59.083 --> 00:20:00.584]  PrisonPlanet.tv, stay with us.
[00:20:00.604 --> 00:20:06.466]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glasser, a pharmacist from Marks Plaza Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[00:20:06.586 --> 00:20:07.807]  Hi, Alan, welcome to the program.
[00:20:08.007 --> 00:20:08.567]  Thank you, Marvin.
[00:20:08.747 --> 00:20:12.128]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[00:20:12.288 --> 00:20:12.809]  Is that true?
[00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:14.029]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[00:20:14.049 --> 00:20:17.030]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:17.350]  price.
[00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.631]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[00:20:19.671 --> 00:20:20.412]  They're very common.
[00:20:20.492 --> 00:20:23.693]  Those common drugs you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[00:20:23.713 --> 00:20:23.933]  price.
[00:20:24.233 --> 00:20:25.415]  Now, what about Tamoxifen?
[00:20:25.455 --> 00:20:27.837]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[00:20:28.058 --> 00:20:31.862]  Tamoxifen, you can see a 75% savings against the regular U.S.
[00:20:31.882 --> 00:20:32.163]  price.
[00:20:32.523 --> 00:20:34.906]  Now, are these brand name products made by the same companies?
[00:20:35.186 --> 00:20:37.208]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[00:20:37.248 --> 00:20:39.271]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.

[00:22:00.658 --> 00:22:04.240]  Every hour of every day, someone out there is suffering from hemorrhoids.

[00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.852]  After the doctor recommended surgery, we didn't know what to do.
[00:22:22.212 --> 00:22:25.975]  I ordered Hemtab online, and soon after taking Hemtab, the pain was gone.
[00:22:26.215 --> 00:22:28.156]  A few days later, the hemorrhoid began to shrink.
[00:22:28.437 --> 00:22:28.877]  Miracle?

[00:23:00.655 --> 00:23:04.556]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:23:04.776 --> 00:23:17.059]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:23:17.479 --> 00:23:17.879]  The U.S.
[00:23:17.919 --> 00:23:23.501]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:23:23.901 --> 00:23:26.122]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:23:27.982 --> 00:23:29.043]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:23:29.083 --> 00:23:31.944]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:23:32.044 --> 00:23:38.067]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:23:38.487 --> 00:23:41.849]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[00:23:41.929 --> 00:23:48.272]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[00:23:48.832 --> 00:23:52.820]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[00:23:52.961 --> 00:23:53.221]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:53.241 --> 00:23:53.482]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:04.148 --> 00:24:06.650]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:13.054]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:13.634 --> 00:24:26.182]  I heard a lady call into a national talk show last night and she said, let's just nuke Fallujah because they're not human.
[00:24:28.544 --> 00:24:31.686]  Nuke Fallujah so all those children, all those women
[00:24:32.887 --> 00:24:34.167]  Well, we told them to leave.
[00:24:34.247 --> 00:24:35.388]  Oh yeah, leave their homes?
[00:24:36.688 --> 00:24:37.688]  Where are they supposed to go?
[00:24:38.068 --> 00:24:40.509]  Most of them are picked up and put in these giant camps.
[00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:50.551]  At least half of the 300,000 people did leave, and most of them got picked up and put in these giant sprawling refugee camps where they get interrogated.
[00:24:50.591 --> 00:24:58.653]  Imagine leaving your home, all your possessions, leaving your hometown, driving up to the checkpoints with troops aiming machine guns at you.
[00:24:59.013 --> 00:25:00.653]  A lot of families and people stayed.
[00:25:01.895 --> 00:25:03.957]  Obviously, a lot of them are, quote, insurgents.
[00:25:05.758 --> 00:25:08.441]  And then, here in America, we're saying, nuke them, nuke them, nuke them.
[00:25:08.921 --> 00:25:10.642]  And then we hear, Saddam was evil.
[00:25:10.702 --> 00:25:14.245]  He might have someday had a nuclear weapon and planned to nuke somebody.
[00:25:14.526 --> 00:25:15.847]  But let's nuke them, nuke them, nuke them.
[00:25:16.407 --> 00:25:18.389]  Let's shoot them dead when they're unarmed.
[00:25:18.409 --> 00:25:19.890]  Because they, they're animals.
[00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:21.251]  They shoot unarmed people.
[00:25:22.392 --> 00:25:23.173]  But, wait a minute.
[00:25:23.913 --> 00:25:25.755]  I mean, it's double-think here, folks.
[00:25:27.651 --> 00:25:29.012]  Put them all in camps!
[00:25:29.673 --> 00:25:31.054]  Put all Muslims in camps!
[00:25:31.074 --> 00:25:32.335]  You know, you hear this in this country now.
[00:25:32.915 --> 00:25:36.278]  Anybody that disagrees with the government, put them in a camp because they're aiding terrorists.
[00:25:37.379 --> 00:25:41.522]  Meanwhile, the training is going on that Christians and conservatives and homeschoolers are the real terrorists.
[00:25:41.543 --> 00:25:42.944]  That's what the feds are really training for.
[00:25:43.764 --> 00:25:44.445]  It's amazing!
[00:25:49.456 --> 00:25:57.059]  This is off the web, the audio isn't the best, but here's O'Reilly making excuses, and he plays just a short clip of him walking over and going, oh, he's acting like he's dead.
[00:25:57.119 --> 00:25:57.820]  Boom, boom, boom.
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.380]  Oh, he's dead now.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:06.783]  And this is inside a mosque, and the Marines would have these people as prisoners for over a day.
[00:26:07.244 --> 00:26:08.964]  Let's just walk over and blow somebody's head off.
[00:26:09.444 --> 00:26:14.306]  Of course, this means that when our troops get captured, somebody blows their head off, or cuts their head off.
[00:26:14.346 --> 00:26:15.207]  Are we supposed to then go, man,
[00:26:16.562 --> 00:26:17.723]  Boy, they're evil.
[00:26:17.743 --> 00:26:18.403]  They're bad.
[00:26:18.423 --> 00:26:19.043]  Well, wait a minute.
[00:26:19.083 --> 00:26:19.824]  They are evil.
[00:26:20.504 --> 00:26:21.604]  But how is it good when we do it?
[00:26:21.825 --> 00:26:23.305]  Well, because we're the good guys.
[00:26:24.386 --> 00:26:25.927]  So we don't go by the same rules.
[00:26:26.767 --> 00:26:28.188]  It's good when we blow your head off.
[00:26:28.228 --> 00:26:29.168]  It's bad when they do.
[00:26:29.868 --> 00:26:30.989]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[00:26:31.528 --> 00:26:33.330]  The fierce fighting in Fallujah was brutal.
[00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:35.052]  A few hours ago, we got video in.
[00:26:35.473 --> 00:26:36.454]  That's very disturbing.
[00:26:36.514 --> 00:26:39.838]  If there are children in your room right now, you might want to change the channel.
[00:26:40.539 --> 00:26:41.060]  Here's the deal.
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:47.067]  A Marine patrol came upon some wounded Iraqis, and according to a report in there, one of those wounded men was shot to death.
[00:26:51.666 --> 00:26:54.827]  Now, we cannot independently confirm what happened.
[00:26:55.147 --> 00:27:03.309]  We can tell you one Marine was killed, five were hurt, when a booby trap went off on a dead Iraqi's body, very close to that situation.
[00:27:04.609 --> 00:27:09.270]  Okay, now, again, I'll tell you what I want you to do, Scott.
[00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:16.692]  Online, all over the place, we have the full clip that's a lot clearer, and it's always acting like he's hurt.
[00:27:17.515 --> 00:27:18.797]  Oh, he's acting like he's dead.
[00:27:18.917 --> 00:27:19.458]  And then, oh.
[00:27:20.098 --> 00:27:22.641]  Now, again, what O'Reilly just did was total disinfo.
[00:27:23.582 --> 00:27:25.084]  The Army admits.
[00:27:26.005 --> 00:27:27.587]  Our own media admits.
[00:27:27.687 --> 00:27:29.329]  They had had the mosque for a day.
[00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:31.632]  These guys were all wounded.
[00:27:33.054 --> 00:27:37.359]  And another group of Marines came in and relieved another group that had been there since the day before.
[00:27:38.211 --> 00:27:45.439]  And they walked over and were shoving these guys around, two of them, you know, wounded past being able to be fixed.
[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:51.846]  There's dead Iraqis in the place, and this guy's laying there, and they just walk over and shoot him.
[00:27:52.426 --> 00:27:58.353]  And then O'Reilly implies that, oh, there was a bomb just gone off and the Marines were all upset and, you know, this is just what they did.
[00:27:58.393 --> 00:27:59.294]  That's just not true!
[00:28:03.331 --> 00:28:10.378]  You know, we have this clip we've played probably ten times off PBS, where they catch the family stealing three sticks of wood.
[00:28:10.418 --> 00:28:20.628]  They think they may have stolen three sticks of wood, so they laugh and joke about it, machine gun the car, and then they run over the guy's car with a tank, and then laugh about it.
[00:28:21.505 --> 00:28:27.068]  I mean, let's say this was something solemn they had to do, because you might have stolen wood, and here's the freedom we give you.
[00:28:27.109 --> 00:28:28.970]  This is how we make you love us.
[00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:32.392]  Don't take wood for your family to cook food off a roadside.
[00:28:32.892 --> 00:28:33.653]  That's stealing.
[00:28:34.893 --> 00:28:38.956]  So, what we're going to do now is we're going to run over your car with a tank and then laugh at you.
[00:28:39.956 --> 00:28:41.537]  It's gang member enjoyment.
[00:28:41.557 --> 00:28:42.558]  In fact, do you have that clip?
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:46.861]  Go ahead.
[00:28:46.921 --> 00:28:47.241]  You know what?
[00:28:47.601 --> 00:28:48.942]  We'll roll it after the break.
[00:28:48.962 --> 00:28:50.343]  We don't have time to roll it right now.
[00:28:52.345 --> 00:29:05.030]  And so, we have all these reports, we have the photos, the video of masses of dead children with their arms and legs blown out by the BBC, the Associated Press.
[00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:07.711]  And then what does the CIA do?
[00:29:08.031 --> 00:29:10.192]  Well, we've caught them through some of their Arab front groups.
[00:29:11.667 --> 00:29:20.754]  Websites we know are CIA front groups claiming that they're Arab, putting out fake images of Abrams and dead children laying around that can easily be proven as fakes.
[00:29:20.874 --> 00:29:22.715]  We identified these last night.
[00:29:23.836 --> 00:29:30.981]  And then that way they can show you fake photos in the news, and then admit they're fake later, and then say, oh, we were wrong, it was a mistake.
[00:29:33.863 --> 00:29:36.985]  And then see discredited, only admitted, real photos and video.
[00:29:37.985 --> 00:29:40.127]  A lot of sophisticated tactics being used
[00:29:41.727 --> 00:29:43.209]  But the Pentagon said they'd do this.
[00:29:43.229 --> 00:29:45.151]  They said they were going to lie to us for our own good.
[00:29:46.393 --> 00:29:47.134]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:47.154 --> 00:29:50.658]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.379 --> 00:29:52.300]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.761 --> 00:29:54.363]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.383 --> 00:29:57.968]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.289 --> 00:30:07.576]  Maca is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[00:30:07.976 --> 00:30:12.081]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[00:30:12.561 --> 00:30:19.769]  Only recently has science discovered that Maca is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[00:30:20.309 --> 00:30:27.672]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels.
[00:30:28.012 --> 00:30:30.273]  Increased libido, which helps prevent impotence.
[00:30:30.573 --> 00:30:33.814]  Relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort.
[00:30:34.254 --> 00:30:37.375]  Helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and night sweats.
[00:30:37.696 --> 00:30:40.677]  It also helps prevent osteoporosis and joint pain.
[00:30:41.077 --> 00:30:46.219]  Get your maca from Cliff Scott Enterprises at a price and quality that few can match.
[00:30:46.359 --> 00:30:49.180]  Because we get our maca fresh from the growers in Peru.
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.182]  Call 800-569-4340 for incredible savings!
[00:30:51.242 --> 00:30:52.824]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at Cliff Scott.
[00:31:01.715 --> 00:31:06.620]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:14.848]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:31:15.108 --> 00:31:22.175]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:31:22.335 --> 00:31:23.616]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:31:23.696 --> 00:31:29.600]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:34.884]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:31:34.984 --> 00:31:43.870]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:47.653]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:31:49.534 --> 00:31:53.536]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:31:56.178 --> 00:31:56.498]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:32:03.129 --> 00:32:08.611]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:09.031 --> 00:32:13.273]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:32:13.513 --> 00:32:20.536]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:20.916 --> 00:32:27.018]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:27.158 --> 00:32:28.379]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:28.719 --> 00:32:31.682]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:32:31.822 --> 00:32:33.784]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:32:34.165 --> 00:32:41.412]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:32:41.692 --> 00:32:45.076]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:32:45.496 --> 00:32:48.598]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:32:48.618 --> 00:32:48.658]  866-885-6625.
[00:32:48.678 --> 00:32:48.978]  866-885-6625.
[00:32:48.998 --> 00:32:50.179]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625 call today.
[00:32:50.199 --> 00:32:54.262]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:32:54.282 --> 00:32:56.143]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:21.399 --> 00:33:22.679]  It is Tuesday, my friends.
[00:33:22.699 --> 00:33:25.721]  Your calls are coming up at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:25.741 --> 00:33:27.302]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:27.322 --> 00:33:39.869]  You can talk about how the government's fear-mongering that Bin Laden supposedly has gotten religious approval to nuke us.
[00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:49.055]  Or we can get into this Marine killing an unarmed, injured person a day after the building had been secured and this person had been in custody.
[00:33:50.464 --> 00:33:51.704]  There is so much news.
[00:33:52.224 --> 00:33:54.625]  And again, folks, I'm not on either side of this.
[00:33:55.305 --> 00:33:56.345]  Iraq is a mess.
[00:33:56.465 --> 00:33:58.226]  Our government put Saddam Hussein in.
[00:33:58.926 --> 00:34:02.087]  Our government told him to invade Iran, told him to invade Kuwait.
[00:34:02.587 --> 00:34:03.367]  It's on record.
[00:34:03.407 --> 00:34:07.668]  We killed a million and a half of those people in 12 years of sanctions, many of them children.
[00:34:08.588 --> 00:34:11.109]  The UN was involved in food for oil scams.
[00:34:12.009 --> 00:34:12.449]  So was
[00:34:13.749 --> 00:34:18.876]  Halliburton selling oil-filled equipment to Saddam under sanctions, not letting anybody else do it.
[00:34:19.156 --> 00:34:20.378]  I mean, it's all dirty!
[00:34:21.812 --> 00:34:27.573]  Many other Arab fighters who hate our guts have come in from other countries, who are doing despicable things.
[00:34:28.673 --> 00:34:31.634]  But then you've got Alawi running around as an arch crook.
[00:34:32.174 --> 00:34:38.115]  Then you had, of course, Chalibi before him, one of the Shah's torture masters, and the convicted bank robber running scams.
[00:34:38.635 --> 00:34:43.396]  The Iraqi CR government putting in most of the Ba'athists, Saddam's people, trained at U.S.
[00:34:43.436 --> 00:34:46.637]  military bases, of course, during the 80s, then put back into power.
[00:34:47.843 --> 00:34:54.589]  They see people's property being seized by Illaoi's people, just basic corruption, and they're angry.
[00:34:57.491 --> 00:35:06.819]  And even a lot of our top special forces people have said, look, we bomb innocent houses, we bulldoze date palms and plantations because one sniper shoots at us.
[00:35:07.757 --> 00:35:08.818]  We bulldoze homes.
[00:35:09.059 --> 00:35:10.440]  We bomb whole areas of cities.
[00:35:10.861 --> 00:35:12.482]  It's creating more insurgents.
[00:35:12.522 --> 00:35:13.724]  You kill somebody's wife.
[00:35:14.184 --> 00:35:15.506]  You kill somebody's children.
[00:35:15.806 --> 00:35:17.147]  You kill somebody's mother.
[00:35:17.448 --> 00:35:20.651]  They're going to go pick up an AK-47 and take pot shots at you.
[00:35:23.234 --> 00:35:25.156]  And it's getting more and more of our troops killed.
[00:35:27.782 --> 00:35:46.731]  Our own Pentagon Generals have left, or those that were already retired, those that ran Gulf War One, have said, look, we should have gone in there with 400,000 troops day one, if we were going to do this, restored order immediately, had an immediate election, but instead we tried to put in puppets and oppress the people and let everything fall apart, and this is a quagmire!
[00:35:46.931 --> 00:35:48.411]  Well, it was meant to be a quagmire!
[00:35:48.431 --> 00:35:54.354]  We weren't meant to win Vietnam, and we're not meant to win this, but to go on and on and on, bring them on, as Bush said.
[00:35:55.279 --> 00:35:57.442]  Then look at these sickening quotes out of Wired News.
[00:35:57.462 --> 00:36:00.145]  It's actually Wired has posted a Reuters story.
[00:36:00.846 --> 00:36:00.966]  U.S.
[00:36:00.986 --> 00:36:11.177]  Marines rally around a comrade under the investigation for killing a wounded Iraqi during the offensive in Fallujah saying he was probably under combat stress in unpredictable hair-trigger circumstances.
[00:36:11.217 --> 00:36:14.942]  Well, I would tend to agree with that, but it doesn't mean it's okay.
[00:36:15.982 --> 00:36:27.028]  Marines interviewed on Tuesday said they didn't see the shooting as a scandal, I do, rather the act of a comrade who faced intense pressure during the effort to quell insurgency in the city.
[00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:32.631]  Now listen to this, I can't see why he would, I can see why he would do it.
[00:36:33.692 --> 00:36:37.454]  He was probably running around, being shot at for days on Indian Fallujah.
[00:36:39.102 --> 00:36:44.266]  There should be an investigation, but they should look into the circumstances to Lance Corporal Christopher Hanson.
[00:36:44.346 --> 00:36:45.127]  Now it gets bad.
[00:36:45.647 --> 00:36:48.029]  Quote, I would have shot the insurgent, too.
[00:36:48.369 --> 00:36:53.293]  Two shots to the head, said Sergeant Nicholas Graham 24, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[00:36:53.673 --> 00:36:55.014]  You can't trust these people.
[00:36:55.774 --> 00:36:57.095]  He should not be investigated.
[00:36:57.396 --> 00:36:59.197]  He did nothing wrong, so we're liberating him.
[00:37:00.418 --> 00:37:01.539]  You can't trust these people.
[00:37:01.559 --> 00:37:02.379]  You know, that goes up.
[00:37:02.639 --> 00:37:04.561]  They're not human that I've heard on talk radio.
[00:37:05.686 --> 00:37:07.387]  They don't even know this guy's an insurgent!
[00:37:07.587 --> 00:37:16.593]  They got wounded people in a mosque, who've been in there for a hospital for a day, one group of Marines leaves, a new comes in, and they walk over and shoot the guy in the head!
[00:37:19.775 --> 00:37:21.496]  And I guess that's one way to win the fight!
[00:37:21.696 --> 00:37:22.597]  Kill everybody!
[00:37:23.157 --> 00:37:24.438]  That's what the Nazis would do!
[00:37:25.118 --> 00:37:34.484]  They'd go into a town, people take pot shots at them, they'd line up for every dead SS officer, they'd line up a couple hundred of the citizens, including women and children, blow their heads off,
[00:37:36.021 --> 00:37:45.144]  Of course, didn't make the Soviets, the Russian people had been for the Nazis as liberators, but a bunch of that behavior they suddenly turned against them.
[00:37:45.164 --> 00:38:01.009]  By the way, they say Hitler would have won World War II if he wouldn't have had his troops just bomb and murder people en masse in those cities in Russia, before they got stopped outside Moscow and Stalingrad.
[00:38:02.771 --> 00:38:05.673]  But hey, the SS had it all figured out, just like our troops.
[00:38:06.113 --> 00:38:07.494]  They've got it all figured out.
[00:38:09.695 --> 00:38:13.237]  And look, the brains behind all this knows exactly what they're doing.
[00:38:15.058 --> 00:38:24.363]  But, to show you how they're abusing the people, here's this PBS clip again, and there's dozens of such clips, where they think they've stolen three sticks of wood.
[00:38:24.383 --> 00:38:26.745]  Y'all go to PrisonPlanet.tv, actually watch the video.
[00:38:27.245 --> 00:38:29.086]  They think they've stolen three sticks of wood, and so
[00:38:29.835 --> 00:38:35.499]  They laugh at them, machine gun the car, run over it with tanks, with the neighborhams, and then laugh at them again.
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:39.902]  Okay, this is, this is how you win the hearts and minds.
[00:38:42.544 --> 00:38:45.666]  Now this is just in the first few weeks of the war, a year and a half ago.
[00:38:45.686 --> 00:38:46.127]  Here it is.
[00:38:46.727 --> 00:38:49.109]  There was still some looting going on when we arrived.
[00:38:49.129 --> 00:38:56.134]  And when we came across soldiers, they didn't seem sure of their role.
[00:38:57.885 --> 00:39:00.047]  That child don't need to be here.
[00:39:00.067 --> 00:39:01.648]  You know what's cool there?
[00:39:01.708 --> 00:39:04.090]  That's what he needs to be doing.
[00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:04.651]  Not us.
[00:39:04.931 --> 00:39:08.354]  We filmed these G.I.s after they caught a group of Iraqis stealing wood.
[00:39:09.094 --> 00:39:11.636]  We try to stop them from looting.
[00:39:11.656 --> 00:39:12.317]  They don't understand.
[00:39:12.337 --> 00:39:14.719]  So we take their car and we crush it.
[00:39:14.939 --> 00:39:15.800]  United States Army.
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:16.220]  Tankers.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:16.500]  Whore.
[00:39:17.361 --> 00:39:23.826]  They shoot the car.
[00:39:23.866 --> 00:39:25.247]  Big smiles on their faces.
[00:39:26.368 --> 00:39:27.289]  Here comes the Abrams.
[00:39:28.087 --> 00:39:31.588]  Drives over it, then backs back over it.
[00:39:31.648 --> 00:39:50.756]  The little car with the family is about a foot high after they're done with it.
[00:39:50.916 --> 00:39:53.316]  Now they laugh.
[00:39:53.356 --> 00:39:57.138]  That's what you get when you loop.
[00:39:58.542 --> 00:40:02.265]  Later, the car's owner told us, I'm a taxi driver.
[00:40:03.026 --> 00:40:04.507]  The car was my livelihood.
[00:40:05.828 --> 00:40:15.496]  By the way, 80%, it's actually 81% of new police are former military, so these hundreds of thousands of troops will be coming home, and they'll be your police officers.
[00:40:17.377 --> 00:40:26.685]  And we'll see more scenes of 21-year-old college students, straight A's, no criminal record, having their eyeballs blown into their brains, dead on the ground.
[00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:31.890]  That's what you get when you loot!
[00:40:33.671 --> 00:40:35.091]  So that's what you get when you loot.
[00:40:35.191 --> 00:40:36.971]  What do you think about all this?
[00:40:36.991 --> 00:40:37.691]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:40:39.272 --> 00:40:46.253]  The military command launched an investigation after video footage showed a U.S.
[00:40:46.273 --> 00:40:51.274]  Marine shooting a wounded and unarmed man in a mosque in the city on Saturday.
[00:40:51.314 --> 00:40:56.555]  The man was one of five wounded and left in the mosque after Marines fought their way through the area.
[00:40:58.308 --> 00:41:04.051]  A pool reporter by NBC correspondent Kevin Seitz said the mosque had been used by insurgents to attack U.S.
[00:41:04.071 --> 00:41:07.813]  forces who stormed it, killing 10 militants and wounded the five.
[00:41:07.833 --> 00:41:10.514]  Said the wounded had been left for others to pick up.
[00:41:11.375 --> 00:41:16.017]  A second group of Marines entered the mosque on Saturday after reports it had been reoccupied.
[00:41:16.397 --> 00:41:23.781]  Footage from the embedded television crew showed the five still in the mosque along with several appeared to be close to death, Seitz said.
[00:41:24.221 --> 00:41:26.322]  He said a Marine noticed one prisoner was still breathing.
[00:41:26.903 --> 00:41:33.847]  A Marine can be heard saying, on the pool footage provided by Reuters Television, he's bleeping, faking he's dead.
[00:41:33.967 --> 00:41:37.069]  The Marine then raises his rifle and fires into the man's head.
[00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:55.600]  Now, a couple weeks ago, on the outskirts of Mosul, trash trucks, and there's video of this, are driving around, paid for by the government, run by Iraqis.
[00:41:56.408 --> 00:41:57.289]  Not terrorists.
[00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:13.158]  And, uh, the army hadn't been told that it was trash trucks at night out picking up the garbage like they do everywhere else in the early morning hours.
[00:42:14.218 --> 00:42:16.500]  And so they saw guys jumping on and off of these big trucks
[00:42:18.172 --> 00:42:20.353]  And from hundreds of yards away, they didn't ask questions.
[00:42:20.393 --> 00:42:23.354]  They just opened fire, blowing up two of the trucks.
[00:42:23.734 --> 00:42:25.455]  And they walk over, and there's these wounded guys.
[00:42:25.555 --> 00:42:29.897]  One guy had his legs blown off, up to his intestines hanging out.
[00:42:31.498 --> 00:42:35.179]  And another one was wounded, begging, please, please, give my friend help.
[00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:37.060]  Flashing their ID badges.
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:38.521]  We're garbage men.
[00:42:39.581 --> 00:42:43.363]  And they walked over and laughed, and began machine-gunning them in the head.
[00:42:44.742 --> 00:42:48.145]  So, we're there to turn the lights on, give them power, help them out.
[00:42:48.926 --> 00:42:58.194]  And so troops just walk over, even after they know it's a trash truck, and are so sick, so mentally ill, out killing so many people, that they just get off on it.
[00:42:58.214 --> 00:42:59.795]  Now that's a small percentage of our troops.
[00:43:00.176 --> 00:43:09.544]  We've interviewed the troops, Marine Corps, you know, Master Sergeants, 18 years in, exemplary record, in Iraq for a year, come back, ought to have them back on.
[00:43:10.405 --> 00:43:11.606]  One of them was Sergeant Massey.
[00:43:13.147 --> 00:43:27.520]  And he describes how they're out there, and the bombs aren't precision, and they just rain down, and there's all these dead children in the streets, and he's holding two-year-olds, you know, with their guts all over the ground, and the baby's dying, and the family's begging, you know, going, we are Shiites!
[00:43:27.701 --> 00:43:30.103]  We have a family who was tortured by Saddam!
[00:43:30.483 --> 00:43:33.346]  We, you know, we aided you in 1991!
[00:43:33.786 --> 00:43:35.368]  Why are you doing this to us?
[00:43:36.912 --> 00:43:43.274]  And he said, after dead child, after dead child, after dead child, just, you know, a car's driving down the road, full of a family, they just opened fire.
[00:43:43.634 --> 00:43:46.475]  Remember when the government sent their Marines into Baghdad?
[00:43:47.115 --> 00:44:04.780]  And, you know, it was live footage, and it just showed trucks, trash trucks, uh, delivery trucks, people driving, they just, machine gun into the windows, people falling out dead in mass, trucks blowing up, Marines cheering, and then the mentally ill, dumbed down ones say, well, this is just like a video game!
[00:44:07.938 --> 00:44:09.079]  That's all this is!
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.301]  This is just like a video game!
[00:44:13.622 --> 00:44:16.083]  That's all we're... You know, wow, this is so easy!
[00:44:17.584 --> 00:44:26.610]  And you look at all the video games we've had for decades, it's trucks and cars driving around, and you just blow them up, and, uh, you run over the old lady with the shopping cart.
[00:44:27.611 --> 00:44:28.712]  Oh, you get bonuses.
[00:44:29.312 --> 00:44:32.474]  You, uh, have sex with the prostitute and then kill her and rob her.
[00:44:33.715 --> 00:44:34.896]  You get the highest bonus.
[00:44:35.712 --> 00:44:43.294]  If the game Dungeon Keeper, you kidnap children, torture them to death, you get extra demonic powers, you build an army underground to go out and kill the good people.
[00:44:44.294 --> 00:44:47.015]  I mean, about half the games are like this now.
[00:44:47.035 --> 00:44:49.035]  The number one game out right now is H.E.L.O.
[00:44:49.055 --> 00:44:49.035]  2.
[00:44:51.336 --> 00:44:52.956]  It's just all going around killing.
[00:44:54.637 --> 00:44:55.557]  Mass conditioning.
[00:44:57.688 --> 00:45:08.673]  And I've talked to Vietnam vets, World War II vets, Korean War vets, who had to, you know, who killed a lot of people, and if you can get them to talk about it around the campfire, you know, these old men would start crying.
[00:45:09.113 --> 00:45:10.174]  They don't want to talk about it.
[00:45:10.554 --> 00:45:11.134]  They did it!
[00:45:13.535 --> 00:45:18.337]  And, uh, they were involved in these wars, but they don't get off on it.
[00:45:18.357 --> 00:45:24.240]  You know, number one, you're not supposed to run over somebody's car or machine gun it because you think they stole some wood.
[00:45:25.126 --> 00:45:27.787]  Number two, you're really not supposed to laugh about it.
[00:45:28.107 --> 00:45:29.247]  This isn't funny!
[00:45:34.269 --> 00:45:35.569]  Man, we're in a war, Alex.
[00:45:35.609 --> 00:45:37.490]  You're putting down our military.
[00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:38.570]  You need to support them.
[00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:44.092]  Supporting the military doesn't mean cutting their VA funding.
[00:45:44.232 --> 00:45:46.333]  It doesn't mean letting them breathe and put uranium.
[00:45:47.433 --> 00:45:51.074]  From the first Gulf War, and now it's even worse than this one, admittedly killing them.
[00:45:51.094 --> 00:45:54.055]  We've had the Pentagon, former experts, retired experts on.
[00:45:55.111 --> 00:45:56.211]  It's in their own handbooks.
[00:45:57.412 --> 00:46:01.653]  You don't send the troops over there, you know, in these cardboard Humvees.
[00:46:01.693 --> 00:46:02.953]  You don't do any of this.
[00:46:06.854 --> 00:46:08.374]  You don't put Saddam into power.
[00:46:09.235 --> 00:46:12.115]  You don't then, after you take him out of power, put the Ba'athists back in.
[00:46:12.415 --> 00:46:14.196]  That's why the Iraqis are so angry.
[00:46:15.056 --> 00:46:22.158]  The same people that robbed and ruled over the Iraqis for decades, put in by our government, have now been put back into power.
[00:46:24.728 --> 00:46:26.049]  Mick in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:46:26.089 --> 00:46:26.789]  Go ahead, Mick.
[00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:38.335]  Yeah, Alex, boy, it's really sad to see this happening to our Army, considering we had a really good reputation for not raping, looting, murdering.
[00:46:38.935 --> 00:46:48.620]  I was listening earlier, and you were mentioning the nuclear weapons, especially you mentioned some of the yield
[00:46:51.007 --> 00:46:53.828]  Yeah, you're talking about a suitcase nuke with certain metals like cobalt
[00:47:15.169 --> 00:47:18.310]  Jacketed, which would then create a lot higher level of radiation.
[00:47:18.911 --> 00:47:22.892]  Exactly, but have a reduced blast as compared with the airburst.
[00:47:22.992 --> 00:47:36.118]  Incidentally, a nifty little tool you or anyone might be interested in is nukefix.com and it's also incidentally a
[00:47:37.518 --> 00:47:40.482]  A great way to find out how many people are in your zip code.
[00:47:42.044 --> 00:47:49.813]  And it has yield variations you can set up, say a hypothetical.
[00:47:52.299 --> 00:47:59.461]  Not just with radiation detectors, but with scans that pick up the resonance with a field of radiation.
[00:47:59.981 --> 00:48:06.163]  I mean, with satellites and helicopters, they know where naturally occurring uranium and plutonium is, much less enriched.
[00:48:06.523 --> 00:48:12.425]  They know where every x-ray machine is, and nuclear weapons stand out like a big red flare.
[00:48:12.805 --> 00:48:18.887]  They know where this stuff is, so the story that Al-Ciada could sneak a nuke in here is just a total fraud.
[00:48:19.469 --> 00:48:19.909]  Oh, sure.
[00:48:19.929 --> 00:48:24.472]  They're in the business of knowing things, and knowing where these things are, especially.
[00:48:25.172 --> 00:48:25.693]  Exactly.
[00:48:25.993 --> 00:48:29.334]  What, our government's paid already over, what is it, like $80 billion since 92?
[00:48:29.735 --> 00:48:32.116]  To the Russians to dismantle stuff?
[00:48:32.516 --> 00:48:34.677]  I mean, nobody's got the money the globalists have.
[00:48:34.978 --> 00:48:38.560]  If anybody sold one of these in the black market, it was because it was meant to happen.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:39.760]  Exactly.
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:40.220]  Sure.
[00:48:40.441 --> 00:48:40.941]  Yeah.
[00:48:41.141 --> 00:48:43.943]  I just thought I would mention that nifty little tool there.
[00:48:44.483 --> 00:48:45.463]  Nuke6.com?
[00:48:47.632 --> 00:48:50.274]  Nukefix.com, like a fix, F-I-X.
[00:48:51.515 --> 00:48:52.315]  Oh, Nukefix.
[00:48:52.716 --> 00:48:52.936]  Yeah.
[00:48:54.077 --> 00:49:05.985]  And you can, you know, it's just an interesting tool, you know, if you were to say, what if, what if I'm in my area, you know, knowing the characteristics of your individual area, you could say, you know, oh, one kiloton of weapons.
[00:49:06.005 --> 00:49:08.066]  Wow, Dr. Strangelove would love that website.
[00:49:08.466 --> 00:49:11.328]  Yeah, it's just kind of fixed up, but it's nifty to know.
[00:49:12.189 --> 00:49:13.249]  Thanks, take it easy.
[00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:15.471]  Hey, good to hear from you, I appreciate the call.
[00:49:17.094 --> 00:49:21.417]  But again, my friends, you know, some of the Iraqi insurgents are really evil.
[00:49:21.818 --> 00:49:24.760]  When they capture our troops, they shoot them when they're unarmed.
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.041]  Man, they're animals.
[00:49:26.081 --> 00:49:27.282]  They're the worst I've ever seen.
[00:49:28.423 --> 00:49:31.325]  Ah, our troops are shooting unarmed, wounded people.
[00:49:31.985 --> 00:49:32.686]  Yeah, big deal.
[00:49:35.067 --> 00:49:36.629]  Well, that's double think, folks.
[00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:38.130]  Come on.
[00:49:39.391 --> 00:49:41.252]  Do I have to explain how that's double think?
[00:49:41.272 --> 00:49:44.414]  I mean, that's totally hypocritical.
[00:49:45.175 --> 00:49:46.376]  That's an oxymoron.
[00:49:47.837 --> 00:49:49.818]  And it's not going to make friends over there.
[00:49:52.739 --> 00:49:53.260]  Oh boy.
[00:49:56.141 --> 00:49:59.182]  It's getting worse and worse and worse and worse.
[00:49:59.742 --> 00:50:07.226]  I mean, I've interviewed so many Marines, so many Army soldiers who've left, who've retired.
[00:50:07.246 --> 00:50:11.688]  And they'll tell you, they just shoot anything that moves.
[00:50:13.621 --> 00:50:25.068]  We've got reports from the British media where down in Ramallah and other areas there'll just be a woman walking down the road and they'll just shoot them with a sniper rifle for fun.
[00:50:26.029 --> 00:50:26.929]  This has been witnessed.
[00:50:29.231 --> 00:50:30.492]  Well, they're animals, though.
[00:50:30.972 --> 00:50:35.495]  They get all the talk radio, all the neocon radio beamed over there to them.
[00:50:35.775 --> 00:50:36.936]  They're listening to that in their barracks.
[00:50:38.189 --> 00:50:40.470]  When they're off, you know, drinking and drinking a case of beer.
[00:50:40.770 --> 00:50:41.750]  Yeah, they're animals.
[00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:42.711]  Yeah, they're animals.
[00:50:42.751 --> 00:50:43.511]  Who else said that?
[00:50:43.931 --> 00:50:44.291]  Hitler.
[00:50:44.811 --> 00:50:48.853]  Oh, these Jews, these gypsies, these people that don't want to go along with the Fuhrer.
[00:50:49.113 --> 00:50:50.033]  They're just animals.
[00:50:50.694 --> 00:50:52.114]  We're not really killing human beings.
[00:50:52.134 --> 00:50:52.734]  They're animals.
[00:50:53.155 --> 00:50:53.655]  They're animals.
[00:50:54.435 --> 00:50:54.755]  Animals.
[00:50:55.035 --> 00:50:55.335]  Animals.
[00:50:56.116 --> 00:50:56.556]  They're not human.
[00:50:59.145 --> 00:50:59.765]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:59.805 --> 00:51:00.766]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:51:01.106 --> 00:51:05.407]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.607 --> 00:51:10.009]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.169 --> 00:51:14.550]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.

[00:56:27.017 --> 00:56:30.298]  Let's go ahead now and go to Chuck in Texas.
[00:56:30.338 --> 00:56:31.278]  Chuck, thanks for holding.
[00:56:31.698 --> 00:56:32.678]  Hi, Alex.
[00:56:33.039 --> 00:56:35.119]  I just had a quick comment to make here.
[00:56:36.099 --> 00:56:45.161]  I've never been in combat or anything, but it seems to me that the last thing you would want to do if you think somebody is booby-trapped is shoot them at close range.
[00:56:47.085 --> 00:56:50.371]  Well, I mean, that's the weird excuse is that, oh, he may have been booby-trapped.
[00:56:50.912 --> 00:56:52.014]  That's how they blur things.
[00:56:52.094 --> 00:56:53.977]  Oh, nearby there had been a booby-trap.
[00:56:54.518 --> 00:56:55.540]  That's not even true.
[00:56:56.141 --> 00:56:58.085]  This is a mosque that had been held...
[00:56:59.329 --> 00:57:07.233]  for a day and a new group of marines moved in and some of the Iraqis were dead, others were bleeding to death and now it turns out this guy was wounded.
[00:57:07.553 --> 00:57:11.475]  First they claimed he wasn't even wounded and they just didn't like him so they splattered his head.
[00:57:11.875 --> 00:57:26.822]  I'm sure that was the way it was and their excuses though, I mean I've been hearing the neocon talk show host out there saying well we don't know what it's like and well I don't think they know what it's like in combat either.
[00:57:27.818 --> 00:57:31.921]  Well, I've talked to a lot of veterans, and we didn't do this in the past.
[00:57:32.021 --> 00:57:45.370]  Now, obviously, there have been a few cases that were sanctioned where you're in ditches, and you've already captured some, say, North Koreans, and there's 5,000 of them about to rush you.
[00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:47.611]  They go ahead and line up their prisoners and shoot them.
[00:57:48.171 --> 00:57:49.092]  That is different.
[00:57:50.253 --> 00:57:51.954]  And that's been sanctioned.
[00:57:52.014 --> 00:57:56.697]  But going into a place you hold with people bleeding to death on the ground, but look,
[00:57:57.515 --> 00:57:59.036]  Let's just forget this case.
[00:57:59.056 --> 00:58:03.138]  This is being used to condition us to accept it while enraging the Arabs at the same time.
[00:58:03.338 --> 00:58:04.559]  That's why NBC released it.
[00:58:04.819 --> 00:58:06.140]  The Pentagon authorized this.
[00:58:07.901 --> 00:58:09.622]  What about the trash truck drivers?
[00:58:09.662 --> 00:58:10.943]  What about the women and children?
[00:58:10.963 --> 00:58:14.625]  What about people that are paid by our government that they kill routinely?
[00:58:15.305 --> 00:58:22.169]  In context with it all, it's obvious that they're trying to anger the locals.
[00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:24.931]  If these people are being trained like this,
[00:58:25.831 --> 00:58:36.195]  It's just a real sad situation as far as our military, and like you say, I worry about these guys coming back and being police officers.
[00:58:36.576 --> 00:58:40.617]  Well, Chuck, what's gonna happen when our troops get captured and get tortured?
[00:58:40.657 --> 00:58:41.518]  How do we complain?
[00:58:41.858 --> 00:58:43.879]  What's gonna happen when they blow our people's heads off?
[00:58:44.579 --> 00:58:45.760]  Well, it'll just be double-think.
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:46.680]  Ooh, look what they did!
[00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:47.300]  It's bad!
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:48.361]  But when we do it, it's good!
[00:58:48.401 --> 00:58:48.961]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:57.503 --> 00:59:02.867]  Red Beckman, the grandfather of the fully informed jury movement, of the court reform movement,
[00:59:27.581 --> 00:59:32.543]  of exposing the 16th Amendment and the IRS never being properly ratified.
[00:59:32.563 --> 00:59:35.303]  That's all coming up.
[00:59:35.363 --> 00:59:36.644]  He's also a veteran himself.
[00:59:36.664 --> 00:59:42.846]  We'll talk about the situation in Fallujah, killing an injured person who'd been in custody for almost a day.
[00:59:44.466 --> 00:59:45.266]  Very serious.
[00:59:45.286 --> 00:59:47.047]  We've got some more clips of this coming up.
[00:59:49.142 --> 00:59:51.103]  And of course, we're going to be taking your phone calls.
[00:59:51.123 --> 00:59:57.964]  We'll talk about the new Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, and just so much more.
[00:59:58.664 --> 01:00:04.186]  And of course, in the third hour, Bob Chapman, International Forecaster, to talk about the plunging dollar exploding gold.
[01:00:04.226 --> 01:00:05.486]  He predicted this months ago, of course.
[01:00:06.186 --> 01:00:06.806]  He'll be joining us.
[01:00:07.406 --> 01:00:09.707]  Right now, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:00:09.747 --> 01:00:11.107]  Let's talk to Frank in Louisiana.
[01:00:11.147 --> 01:00:11.767]  Frank, go ahead.
[01:00:12.608 --> 01:00:13.628]  Good afternoon to you, Alex.
[01:00:14.198 --> 01:00:14.478]  Hello.
[01:00:14.758 --> 01:00:25.546]  You know that General Douglas MacArthur had said that history has failed to record any instance of any nation that went into moral decline that did not end up in political and economic ruin.
[01:00:26.667 --> 01:00:32.291]  And the things you were talking about earlier is all a byproduct of what the American people have become.
[01:00:33.331 --> 01:00:36.554]  And I've gotten more and more to the point that I just don't blame the President.
[01:00:36.594 --> 01:00:37.554]  I blame the Congress.
[01:00:37.594 --> 01:00:41.057]  They have the legislative power to stop all this stuff, but they don't do anything.
[01:00:42.068 --> 01:00:50.290]  You got a criminal run, two-party monopoly, you got a nation filled with baby extermination camps, where we're actually debating whether that's right or not.
[01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:51.990]  This is what you've got to do.
[01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:53.250]  Oh, I know.
[01:00:53.290 --> 01:01:01.032]  LCIA is evil when they cut somebody's head off, which, yeah, those government operatives are, but it's good when we chop up babies.
[01:01:01.892 --> 01:01:03.452]  Yeah, this is wonderful.
[01:01:03.492 --> 01:01:06.193]  Imagine if one of those hooded guys was cutting a baby up on TV.
[01:01:07.048 --> 01:01:08.289]  Well yeah, naturally.
[01:01:08.649 --> 01:01:15.393]  And this is the whole thing that I blame the American people for a swaggering arrogance here.
[01:01:16.573 --> 01:01:19.755]  But people associate their power with this monolithic state.
[01:01:19.935 --> 01:01:21.836]  This monolithic state is raping them!
[01:01:22.917 --> 01:01:28.360]  The more immoral you people become, Alex, history has proven the greater the tyranny that will reign over you.
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:34.623]  We don't even have the ability anymore to see the difference between a Bush and a Kerry or a Clinton.
[01:01:34.643 --> 01:01:35.784]  They're all the same people.
[01:01:36.565 --> 01:01:38.006]  We're fighting the banker's wars.
[01:01:38.046 --> 01:01:40.348]  We're fighting... We have the banker's schools.
[01:01:40.849 --> 01:01:42.370]  They control our money supply.
[01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:44.532]  They've usurped our Constitution.
[01:01:45.433 --> 01:01:50.417]  And the people don't understand all what's going on because we favor ourselves as an intellectual people.
[01:01:50.457 --> 01:01:52.459]  We're one of the most stupid people I've ever seen.
[01:01:53.422 --> 01:01:56.063]  Seeing how we have access to so much information.
[01:01:56.083 --> 01:02:01.805]  50 years ago we had the number one test scores because education was local and a system that worked.
[01:02:01.825 --> 01:02:08.528]  50 years later we're behind every industrialized nation and 20 plus third world nations and we're getting what we pay for.
[01:02:08.548 --> 01:02:10.569]  It is designed to dumb our children down.
[01:02:10.929 --> 01:02:11.529]  That's correct.
[01:02:11.569 --> 01:02:20.953]  Did you hear Sunday I saw on the Mind Wash, I think it was ABC News, that apparently the top echelons of the CIA are resigning now.
[01:02:20.973 --> 01:02:21.453]  Did you see that?
[01:02:22.412 --> 01:02:25.454]  Yeah, they're doing that because a total consolidation is taking place.
[01:02:26.074 --> 01:02:48.728]  Yeah, well, this is all part of it, you see, and we're moving so fast, so rapidly, into an Orwellian state, and people just don't even understand what's going on, and it's hard to talk to people that are so-called educated in the government school systems, because they just follow the mine wars coming out of New York City, which is all controlled and corrupted.
[01:02:49.272 --> 01:02:51.993]  And your news media is one of the most corrupt institutions in America.
[01:02:52.053 --> 01:02:53.113]  Everything's head and south.
[01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:54.794]  Well, they twist and spin.
[01:02:54.814 --> 01:02:55.754]  Thanks for the call.
[01:02:56.735 --> 01:02:58.575]  And again, this video being released.
[01:02:58.655 --> 01:02:59.436]  This was released.
[01:02:59.476 --> 01:03:01.016]  The Pentagon allowed this to be released.
[01:03:01.116 --> 01:03:01.456]  Why?
[01:03:01.696 --> 01:03:04.217]  The dual propaganda psyops use.
[01:03:04.617 --> 01:03:05.758]  Enrage the Arabs.
[01:03:05.798 --> 01:03:09.679]  We have the Pentagon's own $6 billion a year program, P2OG.
[01:03:10.179 --> 01:03:14.441]  It's meant to enrage them and domestically condition us to accept killing prisoners.
[01:03:16.357 --> 01:03:18.979]  And again, what happens when our troops get captured and they get killed?
[01:03:18.999 --> 01:03:20.941]  You know, they claimed that happened with Private Lynch.
[01:03:21.401 --> 01:03:22.522]  Turns out that was made up.
[01:03:22.562 --> 01:03:23.643]  They didn't shoot our prisoners.
[01:03:24.203 --> 01:03:25.804]  But oh, it was so evil, it was so bad.
[01:03:26.325 --> 01:03:29.007]  But then our government does it, and oh, it's good.
[01:03:29.067 --> 01:03:30.528]  I mean, that's a double thing.
[01:03:31.909 --> 01:03:36.413]  We'll talk to Rev Beckman about the power of the jury, what's happening with the IRS.
[01:03:37.293 --> 01:03:41.356]  We'll get his view on the Patriot Act II and the National ID Card.
[01:03:41.376 --> 01:03:43.358]  We'll get his view on the Federal Reserve.
[01:03:45.638 --> 01:03:48.770]  The grandfather of so many modern movements joining us when we get back.
[01:03:52.856 --> 01:03:59.723]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.023 --> 01:04:01.385]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:01.585 --> 01:04:03.807]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:03.947 --> 01:04:06.029]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:11.254]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:11.595 --> 01:04:15.619]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:15.859 --> 01:04:17.640]  You absolutely must see this DVD.

[01:05:48.351 --> 01:05:54.192]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I've got a gripe.
[01:05:54.572 --> 01:05:57.493]  Recently, construction in my area has doubled my commute time.
[01:05:57.653 --> 01:06:01.294]  I'm spending up to four hours in stop-and-go rush hour traffic every day.
[01:06:01.474 --> 01:06:03.914]  The worst part is there's no good talk radio to listen to.
[01:06:04.094 --> 01:06:07.335]  But that doesn't matter to me anymore, thanks to the good people at Freeway Radio.

[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.601]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.241 --> 01:07:03.102]  You want answers?
[01:07:03.803 --> 01:07:04.703]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:04.723 --> 01:07:09.047]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.568 --> 01:07:13.691]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:19.516 --> 01:07:25.682]  So many of the modern elements of the truth movement, the patriot movement,
[01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:45.294]  The Christian Conservative Movement, the Fully Informed Jury Association Movement, the Court Reform Movement, the Movement Exposing the Fraudulent Nature of the 16th Amendment and the Income Tax were spawned and pushed and the key source research done by the man we're now joined by, Red Buckman.
[01:07:46.455 --> 01:07:47.936]  Yes, good to be with you Alex.
[01:07:48.517 --> 01:07:52.660]  Red, it's great to have you on with us and I know you've been
[01:07:54.498 --> 01:07:56.920]  Somewhat ill the last year, but now you're recovered.
[01:07:57.781 --> 01:08:00.945]  And it's great to have you on with us today.
[01:08:01.025 --> 01:08:13.278]  Just out of the gates, can you tell people briefly about your awakening, and then what the New World Order is, what these wars are all about, how the Federal Reserve operates?
[01:08:14.241 --> 01:08:39.437]  Well, I was in the military during the Korean War, of course, and I was a very fortunate young man who I was put into a position where I got an inside look at the military, and I had a top-secret security classification and all, and so I got an inside look, which is something that not too many young people get.
[01:08:40.317 --> 01:08:47.022]  When I came out of the service late in 1952, I was very disillusioned.
[01:08:47.663 --> 01:08:55.328]  I recognized the fact that something was very seriously wrong with our political system in this country.
[01:08:57.250 --> 01:09:05.194]  I became somewhat of a political activist at that time because I kept saying, well, somebody's got to do something.
[01:09:05.955 --> 01:09:12.959]  And of course, what I was trying to do was make the system work the way I was taught in high school.
[01:09:13.179 --> 01:09:17.562]  And it didn't take me too long to figure out that, hey,
[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:23.663]  We don't have any control, the way they taught us in the government school.
[01:09:24.164 --> 01:09:28.747]  They just said, well, you vote on election day and then you go home and go back to sleep again.
[01:09:29.488 --> 01:09:30.869]  And after the election.
[01:09:31.169 --> 01:09:37.993]  And of course it came to my attention that that wasn't controlling this government at all.
[01:09:38.074 --> 01:09:45.279]  And of course, as a result, I did some study, some research, and did a lot of thinking about it.
[01:09:46.099 --> 01:09:57.428]  Found that we have three votes in our political system, of course, and that is the election day vote, the grand jury vote, and the trial jury vote.
[01:09:58.207 --> 01:10:26.669]  and uh... and we were not using the grand jury we were not using the trial jury vote uh... to control our government and of course the federal reserve bank system i was just absolutely uh... you know uh... dumbfounded when i read the the uh... well i read uh... eustis mullins book uh... back there quite a long time ago he wrote that book i think in fifty two if i remember right about the secrets of the federal reserve and um...
[01:10:27.370 --> 01:10:34.972]  You know, the American people, we have been so dumbed down.
[01:10:35.252 --> 01:10:49.816]  We have been so mentally conditioned to believe that we have the greatest political system on the face of the earth, this democracy thing, and we have been neutralized.
[01:10:49.896 --> 01:10:53.177]  We have been, you might say, neutered.
[01:10:54.178 --> 01:10:55.238]  We just haven't
[01:10:56.119 --> 01:10:59.706]  I've done our job and of course I am well encouraged.
[01:11:04.873 --> 01:11:07.155]  That we, the people, are above the government.
[01:11:07.215 --> 01:11:11.698]  It's God, the people, and the government, not the government, the people, and God's forgotten.
[01:11:12.839 --> 01:11:15.801]  And that example is used in the juries and grand juries.
[01:11:16.201 --> 01:11:18.122]  The judge tells the grand jury what to do.
[01:11:18.162 --> 01:11:19.603]  The prosecutor tells them what to do.
[01:11:19.984 --> 01:11:22.045]  The judge tells the trial jury what to do.
[01:11:22.345 --> 01:11:27.969]  That's not how it's supposed to work in all the court cases, and in the founding documents, and in the Magna Carta.
[01:11:28.570 --> 01:11:33.153]  It is we, the people, that are the bosses, but over time they usurped
[01:11:33.673 --> 01:11:41.195]  That authority, and the usurpation of authority in the juries and grand juries, is the same thing we see across the political spectrum.
[01:11:41.575 --> 01:11:42.955]  Yes.
[01:11:43.675 --> 01:11:46.776]  But, you know, Alex, I'm really an optimist.
[01:11:46.796 --> 01:11:47.796]  I always have been.
[01:11:47.816 --> 01:11:51.537]  And I'm more optimistic right now than I've ever been.
[01:11:51.577 --> 01:11:54.618]  You know, 30 years ago, we didn't have Alex Jones.
[01:11:55.484 --> 01:11:57.686]  We didn't have all these talk shows.
[01:11:57.746 --> 01:12:01.029]  We didn't have the activists out there that we have today.
[01:12:01.109 --> 01:12:12.679]  And today, I am just absolutely amazed at how we've got very strong voices just literally coming out of the woodwork all over this nation.
[01:12:13.219 --> 01:12:19.284]  The newsletters, the talk shows, the cassette tapes, the videotapes, the CDs.
[01:12:20.752 --> 01:12:41.960]  It's coming like a flood at this point in time and so I think that we have reason to be optimistic and we have reason to be accelerating our activities so that we can take advantage of all these people out here that have become victims.
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:43.720]  They're victims of government.
[01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:48.782]  And Red Buckman, again the grandfather of the fully informed jury movement,
[01:12:49.806 --> 01:12:54.549]  And a grandfather of exposing the IRS movement, just a real founding father in what's happening.
[01:12:55.090 --> 01:12:55.630]  You're right!
[01:12:55.730 --> 01:12:59.152]  Just six, seven years ago, and I talk about this at least once a week because it's the best news I've got.
[01:12:59.873 --> 01:13:09.619]  Six, seven years ago, on my one talk show here in Austin, one radio station, ten phone lines, half the callers disagreed with me.
[01:13:10.059 --> 01:13:15.042]  Now on a syndicated show, on AM and FM, shortwave internet, satellite,
[01:13:16.307 --> 01:13:24.409]  Nobody calls in a disagree, and on other people's talk shows, mainstream talk shows, where I'm being attacked by the host, almost no one calls in a disagree.
[01:13:24.829 --> 01:13:39.133]  So we've seen a total shift, but the mainstream media continues this illusion that we're all buying into it, so people are all balkanized independently, feeling like they're alone, when really we have the majority view.
[01:13:39.893 --> 01:13:45.855]  Yes, and it's going to... We've got some things happening right now.
[01:13:47.176 --> 01:13:48.336]  Uh, you know, the U.S.
[01:13:48.376 --> 01:14:00.339]  Supreme Court, they went and made a ruling last year, last fall, as I remember, and they said that a judge could not sentence a defendant to, uh, a convicted person to the death penalty.
[01:14:00.759 --> 01:14:04.960]  And then they used a big three-letter word that I just love, B-U-T, but.
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:10.701]  They said the judge can't sentence the guy to the death penalty, but the jury can.
[01:14:12.301 --> 01:14:15.542]  The way I read that, the Supreme Court says judges
[01:14:16.292 --> 01:14:19.375]  You don't have as much power as you thought you had.
[01:14:19.535 --> 01:14:21.116]  It is the people who have the power.
[01:14:21.136 --> 01:14:25.220]  Yeah, judges were never in the executive, you know, executing any of it.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:33.808]  Yeah, and then the Blakely v. Washington case came down in June, and boy, oh boy, oh boy, what a storm it has caused.
[01:14:34.508 --> 01:14:42.055]  The court said that the judges, the district court judges, are bound by the sentencing guideline laws.
[01:14:43.107 --> 01:14:49.756]  And they said the judge can't depart upward with those sentencing, but the jury can.
[01:14:50.757 --> 01:15:00.909]  And it just caused a tremendous storm because what brought about, people don't understand that the sentencing guideline law was passed by the U.S.
[01:15:00.949 --> 01:15:01.370]  Congress.
[01:15:01.934 --> 01:15:15.079]  Because you had one judge that was hanging somebody for a conviction, and another judge was putting a person out on probation for the same crime.
[01:15:16.039 --> 01:15:22.821]  And so there was no, you know, there was no continuity, there was no uniformity.
[01:15:22.981 --> 01:15:24.202]  Selective enforcement.
[01:15:24.662 --> 01:15:30.744]  And yes, and so the Congress, there was so much pressure put on Congress, and people don't realize
[01:15:31.444 --> 01:15:45.310]  That it was the Congress that created the District Courts, the lower courts, and therefore the Congress is the creator and the courts, the District Courts of Federal Courts, are the created.
[01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:50.793]  Well, well, well, Red, I want to get into juries and grand juries power a little bit later.
[01:15:50.853 --> 01:15:55.875]  I want to take some calls, but first off, there's an awakening taking place.
[01:15:55.955 --> 01:16:00.417]  Clearly that's why we see Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security, National ID cards.
[01:16:01.101 --> 01:16:12.365]  We've never seen, I mean obviously the Empire is striking back, we've never seen such a deluge of counter-offenses, but I see as they squeeze tighter, more people are waking up.
[01:16:12.905 --> 01:16:18.347]  Your analysis of Patriot Act II and just all of this insanely corrupt stuff,
[01:16:19.542 --> 01:16:22.184]  People being arrested for Rubik's Cubes.
[01:16:22.885 --> 01:16:24.106]  I'm not joking, folks.
[01:16:24.166 --> 01:16:26.707]  Or being threatened with arrest for Rubik's Cubes for selling them.
[01:16:27.548 --> 01:16:32.451]  People being arrested for complaining to the VA, complaining there's now terrorism.
[01:16:32.812 --> 01:16:33.993]  That's the Associated Press.
[01:16:34.673 --> 01:16:37.635]  All of this just insanity taking place.
[01:16:37.675 --> 01:16:38.276]  Your comments?
[01:16:39.356 --> 01:16:46.021]  You know, history, we have the accounts of tyrant after tyrant.
[01:16:47.207 --> 01:16:56.070]  Who has tried to maintain their power over the people by becoming worse tyrants.
[01:16:56.150 --> 01:17:07.294]  Now, the Homeland Security Act, and of course the Patriot One and Patriot Two, they were not passed because the government was afraid of foreign terrorists.
[01:17:08.254 --> 01:17:11.535]  They were afraid of we the people in this country.
[01:17:12.825 --> 01:17:14.707]  That's what those laws are all about.
[01:17:14.987 --> 01:17:17.510]  They're afraid of Alex Jones.
[01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:18.991]  They're afraid of Red Beckman.
[01:17:19.292 --> 01:17:23.516]  They're afraid of anybody who has figured them out.
[01:17:23.596 --> 01:17:30.122]  Who has been able to identify them as being domestic enemies.
[01:17:31.083 --> 01:17:33.644]  And I'm reminded... Let me throw something else in here.
[01:17:33.664 --> 01:17:43.867]  I'm sure you heard that all over the country, if a state or school district wants federal money, they have to do drills where homeschoolers and Christians are terrorists and are murdering people.
[01:17:44.167 --> 01:17:48.308]  And so really, all the training's not about the Arabs, it's about us, the general public.
[01:17:48.748 --> 01:17:59.791]  Oh yes, and our law enforcement in this country, our highway patrol, our city police, our county sheriffs, the deputy sheriffs and such,
[01:18:00.547 --> 01:18:05.050]  All of these people now, they send them to these special schools.
[01:18:05.951 --> 01:18:12.135]  And in these schools, what they teach is so, I mean, it is so dangerous.
[01:18:12.696 --> 01:18:15.758]  Because they are taught control.
[01:18:16.078 --> 01:18:17.619]  You hear crowd control.
[01:18:18.059 --> 01:18:19.260]  You know, people control.
[01:18:20.121 --> 01:18:27.206]  And these people, they come out of these schools and into our local law enforcement, and they are psychotic.
[01:18:28.208 --> 01:18:32.750]  They are literally, mentally crippled.
[01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:37.293]  And they're just making victims every day.
[01:18:37.973 --> 01:18:42.475]  This is what they're paid for, is to go out and make victims.
[01:18:42.755 --> 01:18:43.976]  Brad Bugman, we got a break.
[01:18:44.016 --> 01:18:48.518]  We'll come back, talk more about this, talk about some of these new court rulings and take calls.
[01:18:49.299 --> 01:18:50.059]  Bunch of news.
[01:18:53.712 --> 01:18:58.355]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glass, who is a pharmacist from Marks Puzzle Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[01:18:58.495 --> 01:18:58.875]  Hi, Alan.
[01:18:58.895 --> 01:18:59.716]  Welcome to the program.
[01:18:59.896 --> 01:19:00.457]  Thank you, Marvin.
[01:19:00.657 --> 01:19:03.999]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[01:19:04.179 --> 01:19:04.719]  Is that true?
[01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:05.540]  Yes, Marvin.
[01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:05.920]  It's true.
[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:08.922]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[01:19:08.982 --> 01:19:09.242]  price.
[01:19:09.443 --> 01:19:11.524]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[01:19:11.564 --> 01:19:12.305]  They're very common.
[01:19:12.385 --> 01:19:15.587]  Those common drugs, you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[01:19:15.607 --> 01:19:15.827]  price.
[01:19:16.127 --> 01:19:17.288]  Now, what about Tamoxifen?
[01:19:17.308 --> 01:19:19.731]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[01:19:19.951 --> 01:19:23.735]  Tamoxifen, you can see a 75% savings against the regular U.S.
[01:19:23.775 --> 01:19:24.075]  price.
[01:19:24.416 --> 01:19:26.798]  Now, are these brand name products made by the same companies?
[01:19:27.079 --> 01:19:29.081]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[01:19:29.121 --> 01:19:31.143]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.
[01:19:31.403 --> 01:19:36.329]  So to save money on prescription drugs in Canada, call the toll-free number for your information package.

[01:20:51.496 --> 01:20:52.116]  Hey, psst.
[01:20:52.477 --> 01:20:58.041]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[01:20:58.282 --> 01:20:59.322]  You use deodorant, right?
[01:20:59.543 --> 01:21:00.443]  Well, let's hope you do.
[01:21:00.583 --> 01:21:03.206]  You obviously wear it to cover up the embarrassing underarm odor.
[01:21:03.426 --> 01:21:08.290]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:09.491]  Check out this new product.
[01:21:09.691 --> 01:21:12.672]  It's called NoVO and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[01:21:12.973 --> 01:21:16.935]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust NoVO to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[01:21:17.135 --> 01:21:20.117]  Look, the creator of NoVO understands what you're going through.
[01:21:20.277 --> 01:21:26.020]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:27.601]  Now, she wants to share it with you.
[01:21:27.901 --> 01:21:28.682]  Still not convinced?
[01:21:28.922 --> 01:21:29.282]  Try it.
[01:21:29.422 --> 01:21:30.643]  Go ahead, try NoVO.
[01:21:30.783 --> 01:21:31.763]  It comes with a 100% money back offer.
[01:21:33.004 --> 01:21:34.404]  Jack Browning for Midas Resources.
[01:21:55.299 --> 01:21:58.721]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[01:21:59.221 --> 01:21:59.882]  Let's update.
[01:22:00.402 --> 01:22:03.864]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[01:22:04.524 --> 01:22:08.246]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[01:22:08.927 --> 01:22:09.867]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[01:22:09.907 --> 01:22:12.229]  dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[01:22:12.749 --> 01:22:13.650]  Today, the U.S.
[01:22:13.690 --> 01:22:15.911]  dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[01:22:16.291 --> 01:22:17.832]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[01:22:18.392 --> 01:22:20.373]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283.
[01:22:21.727 --> 01:22:26.591]  January of 04, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[01:22:27.592 --> 01:22:29.753]  Gold is moving, equities are treading water.
[01:22:30.154 --> 01:22:32.796]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[01:22:33.356 --> 01:22:34.717]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[01:22:35.158 --> 01:22:36.879]  Physical possession, private gold.
[01:22:37.279 --> 01:22:39.261]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[01:22:39.661 --> 01:22:41.783]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[01:22:43.965 --> 01:22:46.106]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.
[01:22:46.487 --> 01:22:46.787]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:06.147 --> 01:23:21.079]  The government says, give up all your rights, take a national ID card through your driver's license, let us arrest you for no reason, torture you, it's all good, because the terrorists are about to strike, but oh, we're going to leave the borders wide open and create a Pan-American Union.
[01:23:23.301 --> 01:23:25.543]  It's all happening, right now, in your face.
[01:23:26.044 --> 01:23:27.585]  Your calls are coming up the next segment.
[01:23:28.473 --> 01:23:32.998]  Regina and Sheldon and Ron and Jeff and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:23:33.018 --> 01:23:34.079]  We're talking to Red Beckman.
[01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:38.804]  Red, continuing with this whole police state.
[01:23:40.326 --> 01:23:44.991]  I mean, just ten years ago, cops didn't bulge their eyes out at you and act all upset all the time.
[01:23:45.011 --> 01:23:47.353]  But more and more of them are these types.
[01:23:47.994 --> 01:23:49.836]  And then a lot of our troops that have been trained
[01:23:50.903 --> 01:23:53.544]  Uh, you know, shoot unarmed, uh, wounded people.
[01:23:53.564 --> 01:23:55.144]  They're gonna come back and be cops here.
[01:23:55.764 --> 01:23:59.806]  Uh, you're a military veteran yourself, and we were always known for not acting like this.
[01:24:00.226 --> 01:24:04.047]  Now we are, and I hear people on talk radio going, the Muslims are animals.
[01:24:04.127 --> 01:24:04.827]  Kill them all.
[01:24:05.187 --> 01:24:06.688]  I thought we were over there liberating them.
[01:24:07.368 --> 01:24:10.149]  I thought Saddam was bad, because he tortured people.
[01:24:10.549 --> 01:24:10.869]  Mm-hmm.
[01:24:11.869 --> 01:24:14.570]  And, and of course, uh, you know, uh,
[01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:17.361]  Tyrants are always the same.
[01:24:17.401 --> 01:24:18.842]  They always think the same.
[01:24:18.922 --> 01:24:33.013]  And the more severe they become, and the more psycho, the more people that wake up and become opposition.
[01:24:33.253 --> 01:24:43.901]  And so every time they do, you know, another Patriot One, Patriot Two and such, every time they do that, and every time they go out and step on people,
[01:24:44.651 --> 01:24:49.493]  They make another, you know, a wide-awake American.
[01:24:49.613 --> 01:24:52.914]  Let me bring up something that fits into this.
[01:24:53.494 --> 01:24:59.596]  Arnold Schwarzenegger openly supports Nazis, like Kurt Voltheimer after it was out that he was a Nazi.
[01:24:59.636 --> 01:25:04.637]  He went and campaigned for him for the presidency of Austria.
[01:25:05.978 --> 01:25:09.619]  Arnold says that he admires Hitler, that he wants to be worshipped as a dictator.
[01:25:09.639 --> 01:25:10.639]  These are public statements.
[01:25:11.835 --> 01:25:16.017]  But then somehow the media all loves him and covers up for him.
[01:25:16.377 --> 01:25:18.838]  Now they want to amend Article 2 of the Constitution.
[01:25:18.878 --> 01:25:21.460]  They keep using this red herring of 22nd Amendment.
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:29.284]  But the group out there pushing for it now, for Arnold, one of his former campaign managers, says, yeah, it's Article 2, Section 5.
[01:25:31.425 --> 01:25:38.028]  How bad is it going to get when congressmen are saying that the Republican Party wants Arnold to be our next president?
[01:25:40.868 --> 01:25:44.332]  You know, this is absolutely insane.
[01:25:46.314 --> 01:25:53.443]  You know, and of course, I ran for governor back in 1988 back in the state of Montana.
[01:25:54.615 --> 01:26:14.364]  And we had vote fraud and it was documented, we documented it so carefully and so thoroughly and we had the same thing that happened on the national level in this election with the Ohio elections, the vote fraud.
[01:26:15.254 --> 01:26:18.195]  And, uh, but nobody found out about it.
[01:26:18.275 --> 01:26:24.778]  We took all the evidence to the Secretary of State and he was going to do something and of course nothing was done.
[01:26:25.518 --> 01:26:31.521]  But now it is so prevalent, I mean it is so visible, it's so obvious,
[01:26:32.963 --> 01:26:36.846]  And so people are being exposed to the truth.
[01:26:37.487 --> 01:26:38.968]  And like I say, that was 1988.
[01:26:39.508 --> 01:26:41.710]  We're talking about 16 years ago.
[01:26:42.231 --> 01:26:43.252]  We had vote fraud.
[01:26:43.792 --> 01:26:49.617]  Now, they have become so blatant and so, you know, it's so visible.
[01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:52.620]  Well, Red, you just got to the heart of the matter.
[01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:56.003]  In major polls, eight-tenths of Americans
[01:26:56.818 --> 01:26:58.759]  Well, that's crazy, but I'll tell you, they are
[01:27:19.151 --> 01:27:21.032]  Waking up a lot of people.
[01:27:21.072 --> 01:27:31.336]  A lot of people are being activated, you might say, into the freedom movement in this country by these kind of shenanigans, these kind of criminal activities.
[01:27:31.676 --> 01:27:33.997]  Why would the elite want to put Arnold Schwarzenegger in?
[01:27:35.858 --> 01:27:37.479]  Because he's one of them.
[01:27:37.499 --> 01:27:41.020]  He's got a lot of money.
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:44.022]  He's married to a Kennedy family member.
[01:27:45.649 --> 01:27:47.811]  I don't think so.
[01:28:13.175 --> 01:28:16.062]  He may fall flat on his face in California, however.
[01:28:19.378 --> 01:28:23.061]  He's not solving their fiscal problem.
[01:28:23.081 --> 01:28:24.122]  But the media doesn't care.
[01:28:24.162 --> 01:28:27.264]  They claim he is, when their actual budget is doubled.
[01:28:27.684 --> 01:28:27.984]  Yes.
[01:28:28.265 --> 01:28:30.566]  And their actual deficit.
[01:28:30.686 --> 01:28:34.209]  And of course, like George W. Bush, they call him a conservative.
[01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:42.755]  And I'll tell you, if George W. Bush is a conservative, Bill Clinton was a... We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.215 --> 01:28:44.136]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.596 --> 01:28:46.118]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.121 --> 01:28:49.799]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.073 --> 01:28:55.534]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.

[01:29:03.397 --> 01:29:07.819]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.

[01:29:18.683 --> 01:29:22.347]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.

[01:29:31.656 --> 01:29:33.278]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:29:33.458 --> 01:29:34.359]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:29:34.459 --> 01:29:36.441]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds.
[01:29:36.681 --> 01:29:37.422]  Every year.

[01:31:05.682 --> 01:31:12.704]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:13.084 --> 01:31:19.186]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:19.206 --> 01:31:20.546]  There are no side effects.

[01:31:42.124 --> 01:31:42.364]  Call today.
[01:31:42.444 --> 01:31:47.486]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:31:47.746 --> 01:31:49.186]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:09.614 --> 01:32:12.035]  Well, he's a super, super, super conservative.
[01:32:12.055 --> 01:32:15.776]  You know, what George W. Bush has been able to pull off
[01:32:33.903 --> 01:32:37.886]  You know, because he was pegged as a conservative and a Republican.
[01:32:39.487 --> 01:32:44.330]  You know, there were so many more watchdogs watching Bill Clinton.
[01:32:45.211 --> 01:32:50.514]  But a lot of them, they didn't, you know, anything that George W. Bush did was fine.
[01:32:51.295 --> 01:32:54.297]  And of course, they're called the neoconservatives, you know.
[01:32:55.612 --> 01:33:10.326]  And so, you know, it's been that way, you know, and Franklin D. Roosevelt, he won election on strictly a conservative platform and within a hundred days he violated every campaign promise he made.
[01:33:11.307 --> 01:33:13.509]  And that's the way it's always been.
[01:33:14.430 --> 01:33:14.771]  It takes
[01:33:15.563 --> 01:33:25.870]  You know, a candidate for president, they have to have a conservative agenda that they promote.
[01:33:26.710 --> 01:33:34.035]  But then, you know, well, with Ronald Reagan, let's face it, he was a big spender.
[01:33:37.297 --> 01:33:38.798]  But nothing compared to George?
[01:33:39.298 --> 01:33:40.259]  Nothing.
[01:33:40.439 --> 01:33:42.620]  George W. is going to have the record.
[01:33:43.041 --> 01:33:44.982]  He's by far the worst that we've ever had.
[01:33:46.374 --> 01:34:04.718]  And then they give us a choice that isn't a choice at all, and then conservatives, so-called conservatives, call me a liberal because I'm against Bush for open borders, Bush is for the assault of his man, Bush is for UNESCO, Bush is for the free trade area of the Americas, Bush is for all this stuff, and they act like he's the leader of some football team.
[01:34:04.738 --> 01:34:10.039]  They even sell t-shirts where it's a W on a football helmet and imply their football team has won.
[01:34:10.139 --> 01:34:12.320]  It's boiled down to that psychology.
[01:34:14.452 --> 01:34:18.155]  A bunch of metal cripples, mentally imbalanced.
[01:34:20.057 --> 01:34:28.183]  They just can't seem to, you know, understand that what's really happening to us is we're just being sold out.
[01:34:29.364 --> 01:34:31.847]  Well, the dollar is plunging.
[01:34:32.827 --> 01:34:35.890]  The borders, the jobs are flowing out at massive rates.
[01:34:36.670 --> 01:34:39.493]  And Bush laughs and says, a low dollar's good.
[01:34:39.833 --> 01:34:41.294]  Our number one export is jobs.
[01:34:41.334 --> 01:34:43.136]  He actually said that in January of this year.
[01:34:43.969 --> 01:34:47.231]  And these people are celebrating, Red!
[01:34:47.251 --> 01:34:48.512]  They think they've had some victory!
[01:34:48.792 --> 01:34:49.032]  Uh-huh.
[01:34:49.472 --> 01:34:49.712]  Yeah.
[01:34:50.693 --> 01:34:59.578]  I want to go to some calls, Red, but before we do that, get more into what the jury's supposed to operate as and some of these new rulings that you're so excited about.
[01:34:59.598 --> 01:35:01.699]  Uh-huh.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:11.385]  You know, talk about the jury, how juries are supposed to operate, and you were telling me this morning there's a lot of rulings you're excited about.
[01:35:11.525 --> 01:35:12.926]  There's some good things happening.
[01:35:14.772 --> 01:35:16.273]  Tell us about some of those calls.
[01:35:16.593 --> 01:35:20.175]  Well, I think that, you know, the U.S.
[01:35:20.215 --> 01:35:33.321]  Supreme Court, we've got a bunch of old-timers on there now, and I think it may be that they're hanging on because they see the handwriting on the wall and they're going to try to make a change.
[01:35:35.228 --> 01:35:43.756]  That decision a year ago about the death penalty cases, where they said the judge can't sentence the death penalty, but the jury can.
[01:35:44.336 --> 01:35:48.360]  The jury, they said, basically the jury has the power, not the judge.
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:56.327]  And the Blakely v. Washington case came out in June of this year, and they said the judge cannot
[01:35:57.228 --> 01:36:02.672]  Go and sentence somebody to more than what the sentencing guidelines call for.
[01:36:03.233 --> 01:36:04.554]  But the jury can.
[01:36:05.094 --> 01:36:07.476]  The jury has the power, not the judge.
[01:36:07.576 --> 01:36:08.157]  And the U.S.
[01:36:08.177 --> 01:36:12.540]  Supreme Court now has handed down a number of decisions in the last several years.
[01:36:13.121 --> 01:36:21.768]  Now, part of that is because I have a case that has been docketed with the United States Supreme Court in my own personal income tax case.
[01:36:22.148 --> 01:36:23.869]  It's been docketed since August of 96.
[01:36:26.425 --> 01:36:28.005]  People think, well, that's a long time.
[01:36:28.025 --> 01:36:37.427]  Well, the Michael New case was docketed in 1995, and it's older, but they are hearing that case this month now in the U.S.
[01:36:37.447 --> 01:36:38.207]  Supreme Court.
[01:36:38.287 --> 01:36:39.387]  It's scheduled for hearing.
[01:36:39.947 --> 01:36:42.928]  But here's what I think is happening.
[01:36:44.608 --> 01:36:47.369]  I sued a federal judge.
[01:36:47.729 --> 01:36:49.249]  In that case, it's at the U.S.
[01:36:49.269 --> 01:36:49.969]  Supreme Court.
[01:36:50.669 --> 01:36:54.310]  I sued him, and I said that he is a government employee
[01:36:55.129 --> 01:36:57.110]  He is a tax consumer.
[01:36:57.630 --> 01:37:00.111]  He is a beneficiary of the tax laws.
[01:37:00.691 --> 01:37:10.155]  Therefore, he cannot make any finding of fact or conclusion of law in a tax case because he has a conflict of interest.
[01:37:10.715 --> 01:37:14.897]  Therefore, a 7th Amendment common law jury
[01:37:15.838 --> 01:37:22.183]  They are the ones who have to settle this controversy that I have with the federal government through the IRS.
[01:37:22.984 --> 01:37:24.685]  And I believe that the U.S.
[01:37:24.705 --> 01:37:36.174]  Supreme Court has made a number of decisions now in these last eight years that indicate that they recognize what I said and what I'm saying and how important it is.
[01:37:36.354 --> 01:37:37.876]  Well, Red, let me ask you a question.
[01:37:38.776 --> 01:37:42.980]  Because the Supreme Court came out and ruled they can take your property without just compensation.
[01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:43.620]  They've ruled
[01:37:45.626 --> 01:37:50.891]  On some other things, good though, we really had a mixed bag from the Supreme Court.
[01:37:50.911 --> 01:37:51.832]  What do you think is happening?
[01:37:52.452 --> 01:37:56.756]  Well, I think that there's a great deal of confusion in the legal profession.
[01:37:57.357 --> 01:38:05.945]  The legal profession, you see, for over 200 years, have tried to let the 7th Amendment fall through the cracks.
[01:38:06.933 --> 01:38:11.396]  And if I've got time here before the next break, I'd like to read the 7th Amendment.
[01:38:11.556 --> 01:38:13.017]  Yeah, go ahead and read it and we'll go to calls.
[01:38:13.277 --> 01:38:30.366]  In suits at common law where the value in controversy shall exceed $20, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of the United States than according to the rules of the common law.
[01:38:32.156 --> 01:38:36.658]  Well, that really means the Supreme Court can't even do stuff without having a jury.
[01:38:36.758 --> 01:38:37.959]  They can't touch it.
[01:38:38.139 --> 01:38:43.042]  And, of course, the first case, the real constitutional issue that the U.S.
[01:38:43.062 --> 01:38:48.284]  Supreme Court ruled on back in the beginning of our nation was Brailford v. Georgia.
[01:38:48.965 --> 01:38:49.865]  And the U.S.
[01:38:51.206 --> 01:38:56.809]  Supreme Court sat, and they argued the case, and a jury made the decision.
[01:38:56.869 --> 01:38:59.510]  They sat and argued the case before a jury.
[01:39:00.609 --> 01:39:11.723]  The jury, the court, like the Blakely v. Washington case and the death penalty case, the Supreme Court is saying, hey, the jury's the one with the power.
[01:39:11.983 --> 01:39:13.105]  They're we, the people.
[01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:18.861]  Now again, the Bill of Rights says this, the Common Law says it, the Federalist Papers, the Anti-Federalist Papers.
[01:39:19.241 --> 01:39:20.241]  This is just a fact.
[01:39:20.281 --> 01:39:27.723]  But then, with these new Admiralty Courts and these Maritime Administration Courts... Well, that's the legal profession, you see.
[01:39:28.023 --> 01:39:29.683]  They don't like the 7th Amendment.
[01:39:29.703 --> 01:39:32.504]  Yeah, so they've erected these fraudulent courts.
[01:39:32.524 --> 01:39:33.944]  They just create them out of thin air.
[01:39:34.804 --> 01:39:37.185]  We get all these new courts.
[01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:42.281]  And here's an example of someone just producing something new.
[01:39:42.701 --> 01:39:51.424]  Judge Walter Smith in 1999 says to the Davidians in the civil trial, you don't get a jury, I am going to decide.
[01:39:51.444 --> 01:39:58.007]  Then we protested, so he appointed his own quote, advisatory jury, and he said it would have no effect on the outcome.
[01:39:58.247 --> 01:40:00.208]  I mean, how did they just invent stuff?
[01:40:00.928 --> 01:40:04.129]  Well, that's going to come to a screech and scream and all, because
[01:40:04.901 --> 01:40:11.467]  The 7th Amendment is the most important of the 10 articles of the Bill of Rights.
[01:40:12.287 --> 01:40:26.820]  The 7th is by far the most important, and the reason is, you look at the 5 clauses of the 1st Amendment, and the ACLU and those kind of organizations, they love that 1st Amendment, they love the 4th Amendment, they love the 5th Amendment.
[01:40:27.688 --> 01:40:34.730]  How do you get recourse if some bureaucrat violates your free speech or your free press or your freedom to assemble?
[01:40:35.070 --> 01:40:36.190]  How do you get recourse?
[01:40:36.590 --> 01:40:38.150]  How do you get a justice?
[01:40:38.930 --> 01:40:42.111]  You have to go to the 7th Amendment and use those people.
[01:40:42.191 --> 01:40:46.112]  Because the final backup is the voting of the jurors.
[01:40:46.592 --> 01:40:47.152]  Absolutely.
[01:40:47.392 --> 01:40:49.433]  Let's go to some calls here.
[01:40:50.993 --> 01:40:52.053]  Who's up first here?
[01:40:53.434 --> 01:40:55.514]  Sheldon in Arizona, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[01:40:56.485 --> 01:41:00.987]  Hi Anthony, I just wanted to preface my call... Hey, I'm Alex Jones, we're talking to Red Beckman.
[01:41:01.207 --> 01:41:07.709]  I mean, Alex, I wanted to preface my call by saying that Anthony Hilder's webmaster was murdered.
[01:41:07.770 --> 01:41:08.550]  Are you aware of that?
[01:41:10.251 --> 01:41:11.371]  No, I wasn't aware of that.
[01:41:11.391 --> 01:41:12.531]  I guess that's why you said Anthony.
[01:41:13.392 --> 01:41:16.493]  I thought he thought my name was... No, Anthony Hilder's webmaster was murdered?
[01:41:16.933 --> 01:41:20.655]  Yeah, but he said it wasn't political.
[01:41:21.375 --> 01:41:22.755]  I just wanted to let you know about that.
[01:41:24.778 --> 01:41:29.726]  The reason I'm calling today is I wanted to get the word out about this because I don't think you mentioned it yesterday.
[01:41:30.641 --> 01:41:35.883]  Um, this Bush's Orwellian plan to screen all Americans for mental health problems.
[01:41:36.103 --> 01:41:38.284]  I've been talking about it for, uh, two years.
[01:41:38.444 --> 01:41:38.824]  Yeah.
[01:41:39.084 --> 01:41:40.765]  It's the New Freedom Initiative.
[01:41:41.705 --> 01:41:50.369]  And it will forcibly, psychologically test every child, even if they're private school or homeschooled, by law, twice a year, every adult once a year, to get the federal funds.
[01:41:50.409 --> 01:41:51.929]  Illinois is about to make adults do it.
[01:41:52.229 --> 01:41:53.530]  Ten states are already doing it.
[01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:55.531]  How is that conservative, Red?
[01:41:55.731 --> 01:41:58.112]  That's something right out of Joseph Stalin's playbook.
[01:41:58.352 --> 01:41:58.992]  Absolutely.
[01:42:00.285 --> 01:42:13.614]  Well, what I wanted to tell you, Alex, is that the Senate's supposed to reconvene this week to make a vote on it through a, what is it, a Labor, Health, and Human Services... No, I know, and Ron Paul and others has got a bill to defeat it.
[01:42:13.634 --> 01:42:16.196]  That's why we got Ron Paul lined up later this week.
[01:42:16.977 --> 01:42:18.058]  But yeah, tell us about it.
[01:42:18.078 --> 01:42:18.318]  Go ahead.
[01:42:18.858 --> 01:42:28.625]  Okay, yeah, the Senate's supposed to reconvene this week to make a vote on it through what's called the Labor, Health, and Human Services and Education Appropriations Bill.
[01:42:29.025 --> 01:42:29.866]  It's a House bill.
[01:42:30.475 --> 01:42:31.115]  Bill number is 5006.
[01:42:33.316 --> 01:42:37.897]  And again, already with federal funds in ten states they're doing it with the children.
[01:42:38.297 --> 01:42:50.081]  This will make it the law, this is in the bill, where they actually send, not even psychiatrists, which is quackery as well, but bureaucrats who will come to your door if you're a homeschooler and
[01:42:50.461 --> 01:42:57.546]  But order you to turn your child over to them, upwards in some cases of a week, to go to a psychiatric institution.
[01:42:57.786 --> 01:43:03.409]  Everyone will have to go, and in the schools they're going to be turned into giant mind control laboratories.
[01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:06.131]  Even the British Medical Journal has said the same thing I'm saying.
[01:43:06.471 --> 01:43:08.613]  Red, are we living in the Twilight Zone?
[01:43:09.773 --> 01:43:10.654]  Yes, we are.
[01:43:12.075 --> 01:43:25.281]  But I'll tell you, this is the kind of law that is going to get a lot more people informed and get them alerted and it's going to backfire on them.
[01:43:25.762 --> 01:43:35.727]  A lot of people don't realize that the homeschooling, not the homeschooling, the school busing thing, you know what brought the school busing thing down?
[01:43:37.196 --> 01:43:55.774]  A federal judge who was trying to order children to ride a school bus was asked, when were these children convicted of a crime that gave the judge any jurisdiction whatever over that child to where they could sentence that child.
[01:43:55.854 --> 01:44:02.340]  Now, when that bureaucrat shows up at your door and wants to examine your children,
[01:44:03.217 --> 01:44:10.340]  You get his name and you get, you know, his name and his organization, whoever he's representing, and you say, wait a minute.
[01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:18.103]  My child, and nor I, we've never been convicted of a crime, and you don't sentence us to anything.
[01:44:18.143 --> 01:44:20.764]  You don't order us around for anything.
[01:44:21.545 --> 01:44:32.109]  Because not until we have been convicted of a crime by a jury does the government have any jurisdiction over our persons.
[01:44:32.981 --> 01:44:38.526]  I totally agree with you, but again, here in Austin, your child is late to class three times.
[01:44:38.986 --> 01:44:40.387]  That's considered a truancy.
[01:44:41.168 --> 01:44:45.351]  The state law, and great point Sheldon, thanks for the call.
[01:44:46.252 --> 01:44:46.993]  I'll check that out.
[01:44:47.532 --> 01:45:00.018]  The state law says 14 unexcused absences in a semester is criminal, but under color of law, it's not even a law, Red, they say, okay, you've been late to class three times, this is to get the most number of kids in the system.
[01:45:00.458 --> 01:45:02.899]  The portable building is turned into a courtroom.
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:04.920]  We have it on the news.
[01:45:05.260 --> 01:45:07.962]  The judge shouts at the parents, sign the paper.
[01:45:08.682 --> 01:45:16.706]  The parent signs the paper, waving rights, the child instantly goes on probation, then the judge orders drug testing and fines and fees.
[01:45:17.731 --> 01:45:24.334]  Same thing with, uh, there is a law in Texas and in most states against ordering you to take vaccines.
[01:45:24.374 --> 01:45:25.974]  There's no law you have to take them.
[01:45:26.975 --> 01:45:31.217]  But they ran blitzkriegs at the start of the school year, nationwide, saying it's the law, you gotta take your shots.
[01:45:31.637 --> 01:45:32.837]  There was no law.
[01:45:33.137 --> 01:45:34.418]  It's all, I mean, that's the...
[01:45:35.325 --> 01:45:41.568]  Read the level of them just claiming this, and the cops are so dumb, they think if a bureaucrat tells them something, it's the law.
[01:45:42.009 --> 01:45:42.249]  Right.
[01:45:42.389 --> 01:45:48.292]  Cops without warrants, without orders, without anything, routinely go to houses and grab people's children with CPS!
[01:45:48.772 --> 01:45:50.893]  I mean, it's not their, it's their criminals!
[01:45:51.634 --> 01:45:59.118]  Uh, we have, we have a disbarred lawyer, he was, he was a district, an assistant district attorney down here in Portland, Oregon.
[01:45:59.813 --> 01:46:25.980]  that uh... was disbarred and he has been battling this and uh... he's had quite a bit of success and uh... uh... over the last fifteen or sixteen years he has spent two hundred and ninety days or so in jail on contempt charges but now uh... he won't quit he has not backed off and uh... he uh... is now uh... credited with uh...
[01:46:26.576 --> 01:46:34.582]  Yeah, I don't know how many different judges losing their jobs, and this and that, and he goes, when he goes into court now, they pay attention.
[01:46:34.622 --> 01:46:41.187]  Now, he is legal, he's got his law degree, and the whole thing, but he's not a member of the bar.
[01:46:42.208 --> 01:46:45.950]  And these kind of things are happening all over this country.
[01:46:46.391 --> 01:46:47.491]  Well, let me give you an example.
[01:46:48.352 --> 01:46:52.735]  One of my friends was arrested for not letting him search his car in a parking lot.
[01:46:52.755 --> 01:46:54.857]  Of course, nothing was found illegal.
[01:46:56.559 --> 01:47:00.942]  They took him to jail, and then they openly told him, sign this form before we let you out.
[01:47:01.002 --> 01:47:02.343]  It turns out they do this to everybody.
[01:47:02.704 --> 01:47:06.447]  It says you agree that you're convicted to all these crimes, deferred judification.
[01:47:07.547 --> 01:47:14.733]  Then they went on local CBS News in Austin, and said, in Austin, you are guilty.
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:18.101]  Until proven innocent.
[01:47:18.161 --> 01:47:21.463]  They said you must sign a form to leave jail saying you're guilty.
[01:47:21.483 --> 01:47:24.706]  They actually said on the news you no longer get jury trials in Austin.
[01:47:24.886 --> 01:47:25.887]  I ought to send you this video.
[01:47:25.907 --> 01:47:26.667]  This was a few years ago.
[01:47:26.988 --> 01:47:27.808]  I mean, what?
[01:47:28.489 --> 01:47:30.430]  They're just trying to claim everything, aren't they?
[01:47:31.071 --> 01:47:31.491]  Oh, yes.
[01:47:33.332 --> 01:47:37.696]  And, you know, it's really scary, you know, what they're doing.
[01:47:39.628 --> 01:47:42.290]  I'm still the optimist.
[01:47:42.370 --> 01:47:50.837]  I still think that what they're doing is just so typical of any tyranny.
[01:47:50.977 --> 01:47:53.659]  Where in history do you find a tyranny?
[01:47:54.392 --> 01:47:55.453]  That has ever lasted.
[01:47:55.793 --> 01:47:57.634]  They always get thrown over.
[01:47:57.895 --> 01:47:58.775]  Let's take a call.
[01:47:59.596 --> 01:48:00.537]  Ron in New York.
[01:48:00.637 --> 01:48:01.357]  Ron, go ahead.
[01:48:01.377 --> 01:48:02.538]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[01:48:02.958 --> 01:48:04.419]  Well, I'm calling about a few things.
[01:48:05.060 --> 01:48:09.403]  The RFID identification, which by the way, Alex, was... It's going to be in all pill bottles.
[01:48:09.663 --> 01:48:09.823]  Yep.
[01:48:10.063 --> 01:48:11.585]  And Sunday's New York Times, too.
[01:48:11.665 --> 01:48:12.825]  Mainstream publication.
[01:48:13.286 --> 01:48:15.928]  They can't call the Times crazy like they called it.
[01:48:15.948 --> 01:48:18.870]  And your name's going to be scanned on it to make sure that's your bottle.
[01:48:19.358 --> 01:48:19.778]  That's right.
[01:48:19.898 --> 01:48:31.805]  And to show you something about how you've had some useful idiots, and I guess some people who are basically stooges for the system speaking up for it, they keep claiming it's to keep track of inventory, but point of fact, use logic.
[01:48:31.945 --> 01:48:35.206]  No, this new announcement they admit is to make sure that bottle of pills is yours!
[01:48:35.407 --> 01:48:35.707]  That's right.
[01:48:36.067 --> 01:48:39.289]  Well, many people saying it's to make sure of large inventories.
[01:48:39.329 --> 01:48:39.749]  However,
[01:48:40.269 --> 01:48:45.833]  If we're talking about prescription medication, there's no concern with inventory because a customer couldn't steal it off the shelf.
[01:48:45.893 --> 01:48:51.157]  It comes in large bottles that are then put in the dosages that are given to the citizens.
[01:48:51.457 --> 01:48:51.697]  Right.
[01:48:51.937 --> 01:48:57.761]  And your little bottle that you get from a pharmacist in your chain drug store has the RFID on it.
[01:48:58.021 --> 01:49:00.283]  Now what the heck would that have to do with inventory?
[01:49:00.343 --> 01:49:01.944]  Yet they have these huge mouthpieces.
[01:49:01.984 --> 01:49:04.466]  Hey, we've had our people at the RFID conferences
[01:49:07.259 --> 01:49:19.343]  They openly say, from the factory, to the warehouse, to the store, to your home, to the landfill, and they're putting in this wireless internet, they admit that's going to be used to scan all the RFID in your clothes, on your person.
[01:49:20.423 --> 01:49:26.265]  In fact, the Pentagon just came out and called it, we're going to have a God-like control grid, that's a quote, to know everything!
[01:49:27.051 --> 01:49:27.931]  He held off, I can.
[01:49:28.111 --> 01:49:28.351]  Sure.
[01:49:28.551 --> 01:49:30.952]  Hey, Red, does that sound like freedom, a god-like power?
[01:49:31.932 --> 01:49:44.196]  I'll tell ya, you know, in my book, Why the Militia, the 14th chapter, the title on the chapter, the heading on the chapter is, Is the Federal Government a False God?
[01:49:45.737 --> 01:49:50.698]  Well, now, all over they keep calling it god-like omnipresent power.
[01:49:51.178 --> 01:49:52.899]  That's in the Pentagon paper that just came out.
[01:49:53.819 --> 01:49:56.680]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:49:57.407 --> 01:49:58.708]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:49:58.909 --> 01:50:04.654]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:50:04.914 --> 01:50:10.199]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction-solution.
[01:50:10.479 --> 01:50:12.101]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order
[01:50:12.261 --> 01:50:14.643]  This program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:50:14.783 --> 01:50:18.565]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[01:50:18.825 --> 01:50:23.468]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:50:23.569 --> 01:50:26.330]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[01:50:26.631 --> 01:50:29.813]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[01:50:29.853 --> 01:50:31.674]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:50:32.154 --> 01:50:34.255]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.
[01:50:34.335 --> 01:50:37.695]  Call toll-free 1-888-25-33139.
[01:50:38.016 --> 01:50:40.736]  That's 1-888-25-33139.

[01:50:49.898 --> 01:50:51.979]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:50:52.688 --> 01:50:55.711]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:50:56.011 --> 01:51:00.956]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:01.196 --> 01:51:05.560]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:05.860 --> 01:51:14.768]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:14.969 --> 01:51:18.592]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:51:18.872 --> 01:51:23.914]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:24.194 --> 01:51:30.937]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:31.418 --> 01:51:31.958]  What about you?
[01:51:32.711 --> 01:51:38.074]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:53:00.276 --> 01:53:03.138]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:04.179 --> 01:53:06.121]  We're going to go back to Red Beckman here in just a moment.
[01:53:06.141 --> 01:53:09.745]  Hopefully we'll see him a little bit in the next hour with Bob Chapman.
[01:53:10.626 --> 01:53:12.368]  Have both of them together, that'd be great.
[01:53:13.268 --> 01:53:14.350]  And of course, your calls.
[01:53:14.710 --> 01:53:20.556]  Before we go back to Red, I just want to say that, look, I'm not kidding, I've even played that newscast here years ago.
[01:53:21.978 --> 01:53:24.521]  We called CBS local and said, go investigate this.
[01:53:24.541 --> 01:53:27.444]  Before they let you out of jail, they call it a personal recognizance bond.
[01:53:27.784 --> 01:53:34.511]  And you sign an agreement to take all these classes and to be on probation for drunk driving, family violence, robbery, drug dealing.
[01:53:34.871 --> 01:53:36.353]  And you can be in there for a speeding ticket.
[01:53:37.634 --> 01:53:39.516]  And when they called the city, the city goes, yeah.
[01:53:39.536 --> 01:53:41.898]  Everybody that comes through, we ask them to sign this.
[01:53:41.978 --> 01:53:44.581]  And it has all these crimes you admit to on the back.
[01:53:45.128 --> 01:53:46.509]  I mean, that's like the Soviet Union.
[01:53:46.529 --> 01:53:50.330]  But in the Soviet Union, they hid that in underground torture centers.
[01:53:50.350 --> 01:53:51.751]  You know, sign this confession.
[01:53:52.111 --> 01:53:53.391]  Here, they just do it in plain view.
[01:53:53.431 --> 01:53:54.592]  People are so dumb, they do it.
[01:53:55.252 --> 01:53:58.233]  Folks, you need to get my Police State films to understand this.
[01:53:59.554 --> 01:54:08.938]  Police State 2000, Police State 2, The Takeover, Police State 3, Total Enslavement, Troops Training to Put You in Camps, Foreign Troops, all this Police State legislation.
[01:54:09.598 --> 01:54:11.879]  Legislation they tried to pass in Oregon, where
[01:54:15.267 --> 01:54:19.231]  Downloading music illegally or getting in a fist fight gets you life in prison.
[01:54:19.251 --> 01:54:20.132]  That almost passed.
[01:54:20.152 --> 01:54:21.333]  We have the actual bill in there.
[01:54:21.893 --> 01:54:22.774]  Under terrorism.
[01:54:22.814 --> 01:54:23.975]  I mean, this is all insane.
[01:54:25.456 --> 01:54:27.458]  Big discounts on my videos right now.

[01:54:54.044 --> 01:54:56.387]  Please get my videos, get them out to people.
[01:54:56.407 --> 01:54:58.290]  I'll carry a bunch of other great videos and books.
[01:54:59.097 --> 01:54:59.698]  Please take action.
[01:54:59.878 --> 01:55:00.938]  Expose the Globalist.
[01:55:19.315 --> 01:55:23.496]  Ron in New York, finish up quick because I want to go to Jeff and Kevin and Fred.
[01:55:23.696 --> 01:55:29.397]  Okay, by the way, he had mentioned that in Texas you wind up being charged with a crime for tardiness.
[01:55:29.437 --> 01:55:32.478]  The last state to do that was Stalin's Soviet state.
[01:55:32.558 --> 01:55:34.998]  Tardiness was a crime in that place.
[01:55:35.418 --> 01:55:37.359]  So they're probably taking some clues from that.
[01:55:37.379 --> 01:55:41.220]  They hired Primacop, the former KGB general, three years ago!
[01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:42.640]  I mean, that's the thing.
[01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:48.441]  Red Beckman, this stuff is so nuts, even when it's public, I think I'm crazy talking about it.
[01:55:50.940 --> 01:56:03.364]  It is crazy what they're doing, but they're getting away with it because of the dumbed down brain of the American citizen.
[01:56:04.204 --> 01:56:06.065]  And that's where we come into the picture.
[01:56:06.125 --> 01:56:11.586]  We have to bring people back up, bring them up to speed with the truth.
[01:56:12.746 --> 01:56:14.907]  And there's more of them listening to us every day.
[01:56:15.287 --> 01:56:16.548]  Ron, what was your final point?
[01:56:18.644 --> 01:56:21.666]  The Supreme Court has considered a case in the state of Illinois.
[01:56:21.706 --> 01:56:23.667]  They may have ruled on it at last, I don't know.
[01:56:24.408 --> 01:56:25.889]  But it was the use of...
[01:56:26.678 --> 01:56:30.739]  Dogs to sniff out drugs and weapons for simple traffic stops.
[01:56:31.199 --> 01:56:40.401]  Now they say it looked as though the Supreme Court was inclined to go along with that in Illinois, even though the Illinois State Court, as per the Illinois Constitution, said it was unconstitutional.
[01:56:40.801 --> 01:56:48.662]  Why it's even in front of the federal court when the state of Illinois chooses to protect its people under its state constitution for that kind of intrusion, I don't know.
[01:56:48.722 --> 01:56:49.682]  That's beyond me.
[01:56:50.103 --> 01:56:52.243]  Any legal scholar would have to scratch their head about that.
[01:56:52.803 --> 01:56:54.065]  Well, I, you know, it's the nature of a tyranny.
[01:57:07.902 --> 01:57:09.643]  Uh, they don't get better, they get worse.
[01:57:10.524 --> 01:57:12.245]  And, uh, progressively worse.
[01:57:12.345 --> 01:57:16.047]  And, uh, at some point, then they get overthrown.
[01:57:16.127 --> 01:57:17.588]  And that's what's going to happen.
[01:57:17.628 --> 01:57:22.150]  You had Colonel Don DeGrand Prix on, uh, your program not too long ago.
[01:57:22.230 --> 01:57:30.075]  And, uh, uh, you know, he, uh, more or less, uh, indicated that 9-1-1, uh, was a coup.
[01:57:30.095 --> 01:57:33.657]  Uh, and, uh, I, I agree with him.
[01:57:34.137 --> 01:57:36.359]  And, uh, we've got to overcome it.
[01:57:36.479 --> 01:57:36.879]  And, uh,
[01:57:37.745 --> 01:57:40.988]  I think part of it is we're going to have to work with our military.
[01:57:41.008 --> 01:57:41.708]  We'll be right back!
[01:57:49.555 --> 01:57:50.196]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.856 --> 01:57:51.897]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.638 --> 01:57:53.779]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.379 --> 01:57:55.240]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.960 --> 01:57:56.861]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.901 --> 01:58:01.285]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.725 --> 01:58:05.769]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.935 --> 01:58:10.037]  I love these round table type of discussions.
[01:58:11.557 --> 01:58:15.719]  And we're honored to have Red Beckman, grandfather of the Fully Informed Jury Movement.
[01:58:16.159 --> 01:58:20.962]  One of the founders of the movement exposing the fraudulent nature of the 16th Amendment and the income tax.
[01:58:23.183 --> 01:58:29.085]  One of the founding, if not the founding member in the movement against reforming our courts.
[01:58:29.245 --> 01:58:30.306]  Along with Bob Chapman.
[01:58:31.112 --> 01:58:36.176]  Who years ago predicted oil at $50 a barrel, which sounded crazy at the time.
[01:58:36.596 --> 01:58:39.338]  Gold at over $400, which now looks like it'll go even higher.
[01:58:39.678 --> 01:58:41.239]  He was on three or four months ago with us.
[01:58:41.279 --> 01:58:45.742]  He said the dollar will go down even further, and the dollar's going to plunge even more.
[01:58:45.822 --> 01:58:48.164]  I hope his predictions start not coming true.
[01:58:49.104 --> 01:58:49.985]  He's on with us.
[01:58:50.325 --> 01:58:58.671]  Of course, was involved in the Army Intelligence, and then had one of the biggest, if not the biggest, financial newsletters in the country for decades.
[01:58:59.841 --> 01:59:12.363]  An expert on the economy is Bob Chapman, and I know we have Kevin and Fred and Ed and so many people that are patiently holding out.
[01:59:12.383 --> 01:59:16.284]  I've got a ton of news I want to throw out on our guests as well, so we'll kind of be a free-for-all.
[01:59:17.004 --> 01:59:17.644]  Bob Chapman?
[01:59:17.664 --> 01:59:19.904]  Do we have you, my friend?
[01:59:19.924 --> 01:59:21.325]  I am here.
[01:59:21.825 --> 01:59:23.585]  It's good to have you on with us.
[01:59:24.005 --> 01:59:26.126]  Red Buckman said your name rang a bell.
[01:59:27.386 --> 01:59:28.626]  Are you aware of Red Buckman?
[01:59:29.858 --> 01:59:30.578]  No, I am not.
[01:59:30.998 --> 01:59:33.439]  Well, you guys are going to get to meet each other today here on the air.
[01:59:33.799 --> 01:59:35.419]  Let's bring our Red Beckman back in.
[01:59:35.479 --> 01:59:35.760]  Red?
[01:59:36.140 --> 01:59:36.540]  I'm here.
[01:59:37.180 --> 01:59:42.201]  All right, you guys are here together, and I'm going to read you both separately many times over the years.
[01:59:42.981 --> 01:59:51.684]  But, Red, Bob's been talking about the dollar plunging, and Bush has been openly out bad-mouthing it and bringing us into the free trade area of the Americas.
[01:59:51.924 --> 01:59:53.324]  What's your take on this?
[01:59:53.384 --> 01:59:54.564]  And we'll get Bob's take on it.
[01:59:55.344 --> 01:59:56.925]  Well, the dollar is
[01:59:58.536 --> 02:00:05.459]  You know, they're going, the international bankers and such, they are going to destroy the dollar.
[02:00:05.499 --> 02:00:08.440]  They're going to destroy the Japanese yen.
[02:00:08.460 --> 02:00:12.121]  They're going to destroy the Swiss franc.
[02:00:12.141 --> 02:00:21.965]  They're going to, the German douchebag, they're going to do that for the simple reason that they want to issue an international currency.
[02:00:23.025 --> 02:00:30.572]  And when they do, it'll probably be backed by gold, and at least that's what they'll tell you, that it's backed by gold.
[02:00:30.712 --> 02:00:36.537]  And when they do, you will basically have your New World Order in place.
[02:00:36.698 --> 02:00:38.419]  We even have the name of the new currency.
[02:00:38.439 --> 02:00:44.725]  They're going to merge the American Union currency with the EU currency with the Asian Union currency around 2020.
[02:00:45.125 --> 02:00:49.109]  Dr. Cuddy's got the documents, I've seen them, and we're talking about the Phoenix
[02:00:50.970 --> 02:00:59.375]  I agree with the gentleman completely.
[02:00:59.856 --> 02:01:06.840]  I think the inamacinations of how we're going to get there is what people are very interested in.
[02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:09.342]  That's why they subscribe to the International Forecaster.
[02:01:10.397 --> 02:01:12.519]  And what's going to happen?
[02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:19.985]  I believe that the dollar and euro terms on the near term over the next year will go down 30% more.
[02:01:20.726 --> 02:01:25.309]  In other words, the euro, which is trading right now around $1.2975 or almost $1.30, will probably go to $1.60, maybe $1.65.
[02:01:32.425 --> 02:01:44.868]  And that's part of the destruction of the dollar, caused by tremendous fiscal and monetary debt, personal debt in the United States, which has become overwhelming.
[02:01:44.888 --> 02:01:56.270]  And in the meantime, the price of gold will go up considerably higher, and it'll become more inflationary, and silver will go up as well.
[02:01:57.190 --> 02:02:01.131]  And I think in the final analysis, the gentleman is correct in as much as
[02:02:02.325 --> 02:02:10.349]  I do believe that they will back their new world currency once they put it into operation with gold.
[02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:19.254]  And I'd like to address that just briefly, and that is that I expect that the introduction will be quicker than 2020.
[02:02:19.474 --> 02:02:22.175]  I think it's 2010 to 12.
[02:02:23.156 --> 02:02:29.359]  And I also believe that the central bank selling that we've witnessed over the past several years
[02:02:30.305 --> 02:02:36.655]  ...has been instigated by what I call elitists, and... Well, I'll tell you what, Bob, we've got a break.
[02:02:37.076 --> 02:02:38.438]  Red Beckman, stay there, both of you.
[02:02:38.799 --> 02:02:43.046]  We'll talk about the state of the dollar and the economy with both of you, and then we'll take calls when we get back.
[02:02:45.094 --> 02:02:49.441]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:49.621 --> 02:02:54.068]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.208 --> 02:02:58.595]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:58.615 --> 02:02:59.977]  The New World Order.
[02:03:00.698 --> 02:03:02.039]  Pan-American!
[02:03:30.418 --> 02:03:31.359]  We're good to go.

[02:04:03.479 --> 02:04:06.621]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:04:06.881 --> 02:04:12.623]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.

[02:04:44.907 --> 02:04:47.028]  Pam got some mud out of her three-year-old's shirt.
[02:04:47.448 --> 02:04:49.249]  Jason had a wine stain on his countertop.
[02:04:49.549 --> 02:04:50.009]  Now gone.
[02:04:50.249 --> 02:04:52.350]  Halloween makeup from Karen's kid got on the carpet.
[02:04:52.690 --> 02:04:53.111]  No trick.
[02:04:53.511 --> 02:04:54.191]  It's gone too.
[02:04:54.591 --> 02:04:55.812]  What do these people have in common?
[02:04:56.112 --> 02:04:59.873]  They've discovered the powerful bubble-up technology in BioWalk Citrus Concentrate.
[02:05:00.073 --> 02:05:02.755]  Kelly brought a puppy home and it left a mess on the new carpet.
[02:05:02.995 --> 02:05:03.615]  Now her carpet
[02:05:03.795 --> 02:05:04.796]  Still looks brand new.
[02:05:05.116 --> 02:05:09.421]  Friend said, it's the most effective pet odor removal product she's ever encountered.
[02:05:09.601 --> 02:05:10.982]  What do these people have in common?
[02:05:11.283 --> 02:05:15.627]  They've discovered the power of pods or pet accident wash-up solutions from Bio-Ops.
[02:05:15.988 --> 02:05:18.190]  Have you discovered the Bio-Ops family of products?
[02:05:18.926 --> 02:05:21.328]  Just in from BioWox, their November special.

[02:05:50.075 --> 02:05:52.575]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:57.957 --> 02:06:01.038]  Alright my friends, your calls are coming up here real quick.
[02:06:01.778 --> 02:06:06.520]  We're talking to Red Beckman and of course we're talking to Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster.
[02:06:08.170 --> 02:06:32.010]  Bob, continuing with your analysis of what's happening to the dollar, and unfortunately your predictions have been spot on, I want to hear more about that, but then also, how the American people, I mean I talked to some poor immigrant from Mexico who was farming corn two years ago, they know what it, and by ignorant I mean they don't have any education,
[02:06:32.654 --> 02:06:35.958]  They know all about what it means to have a bad currency.
[02:06:36.519 --> 02:06:37.440]  A worthless currency.
[02:06:37.941 --> 02:06:41.866]  But the average yuppie will laugh at me about the dollar plunging.
[02:06:42.687 --> 02:06:45.110]  I mean, we're just totally disconnected from reality.
[02:06:48.294 --> 02:06:49.295]  Bob Shadman?
[02:06:49.816 --> 02:07:00.807]  Well, as I was saying, in relation to the backing of a new world currency with gold, over the last several years, central banks have been sellers of gold.
[02:07:01.488 --> 02:07:08.696]  Those central banks are controlled by individuals who have in fact been the actual buyers of that gold.
[02:07:09.566 --> 02:07:24.394]  And so when they go to this world currency, those elitists who have garnered all of this gold, and it could be as much as 20 or 25 or 30 or 40 percent of all the gold that's out there, they will stand to gain a great deal.
[02:07:24.414 --> 02:07:25.415]  Now slow down!
[02:07:25.835 --> 02:07:27.516]  Because, now this is fact.
[02:07:27.876 --> 02:07:29.357]  This has even been in the mainstream news.
[02:07:30.278 --> 02:07:34.100]  But in the back of the financial papers, the big gold mines have sued
[02:07:34.847 --> 02:07:54.320]  The Rothschild Banks and others, and the Federal Reserve, because these private families sell themselves, because let's say they've got five banks, they sell gold at reduced prices between each other, it never even leaves their own hands, to drive down gold artificially so they can then buy up the rest of it at low prices.
[02:07:54.640 --> 02:07:59.223]  Then the Euros, 30% gold backed, the dollar starts plunging.
[02:08:00.324 --> 02:08:03.546]  I just wanted to elaborate on that for people to understand how serious this is.
[02:08:05.115 --> 02:08:22.248]  In addition to that, and in conjunction with what you just said, there is a lawsuit pending, and it's coming to trial in April in New Orleans, Federal District Court, of Blanchard & Company against JPMorgan Chase and Barrick Gold, which is a producer of gold, saying that they were rigging the market.
[02:08:22.328 --> 02:08:27.552]  And Barrick has already said that they should be exempted from the suit, which the judge threw out.
[02:08:27.852 --> 02:08:30.334]  By the way, Barrick is the... On behalf of Central Banks.
[02:08:30.694 --> 02:08:33.416]  Barrick is the company that Bush Sr.
[02:08:33.476 --> 02:08:34.397]  is a board member of.
[02:08:35.507 --> 02:08:38.450]  Uh, he was a member some time ago.
[02:08:38.490 --> 02:08:38.650]  Yes.
[02:08:38.890 --> 02:08:50.962]  He no longer is, as was Brian Mulroney and Margaret Thatcher and Vernon Jordan and another of, uh, you know, political lights.
[02:08:51.502 --> 02:08:52.743]  Sorry for interrupting.
[02:08:52.783 --> 02:08:53.364]  Please continue.
[02:08:54.895 --> 02:09:05.203]  Anyway, but I covered in conjunction with what you were saying, and is that a lot of this will come out when this lawsuit becomes public.
[02:09:05.924 --> 02:09:14.350]  And I think that's what's going to trigger taking gold from $500 an ounce back to $850 mid-year next year.
[02:09:16.432 --> 02:09:18.153]  Let's get a comment from Red Buckman.
[02:09:18.733 --> 02:09:24.618]  Red, they openly say they're going to dismantle our financial system, and people are cheering over it.
[02:09:25.481 --> 02:09:38.803]  Yeah, well, back in 19, well it was Labor Day week of 1984, I was a speaker at an investors conference in Orlando, Florida.
[02:09:39.744 --> 02:09:46.545]  And each evening they had an open forum, and the one evening they had the open forum on the hard money.
[02:09:47.525 --> 02:09:53.406]  And most of the so-called gurus, recognized gurus at that point,
[02:09:54.071 --> 02:10:13.077]  We're there and they were on the platform and each one of them was given a two and a half minute time to give a little prognosis of what they saw coming and they were all agreed that by 1987 we would have a $3,500 minimum on gold and $100 on silver and then they opened it up and there was a lot of
[02:10:24.898 --> 02:10:27.982]  I went up in 1986, but that was the last rally.
[02:10:28.062 --> 02:10:33.448]  And the reason it was the last rally, as we find out, is that illegally, the Federal Reserve and the U.S.
[02:10:33.468 --> 02:10:33.628]  Treasury
[02:10:46.039 --> 02:10:52.984]  During the debacle in 1987 in the stock market, they went in and held the stock market up and they suppressed gold.
[02:10:53.605 --> 02:11:14.561]  And then in 1988, Ronald Reagan signed an executive order allowing for the working market, we call it the Punch Protection Team, the working group on financial markets to come into being and also the Federal Reserve to be able to continue at will to suppress
[02:11:15.450 --> 02:11:18.292]  I had an opportunity then, of course, from the floor.
[02:11:33.807 --> 02:11:45.451]  To speak, and I said that we would not have $3,500 gold because I was from the West and I knew what was happening out here as far as the gold mining was concerned.
[02:11:46.311 --> 02:11:51.812]  And I used to keep my finger on that whole situation.
[02:11:51.892 --> 02:11:56.634]  I used to keep it pretty close and understood pretty well what was happening.
[02:11:56.694 --> 02:12:00.855]  And I brought out to that audience that
[02:12:02.207 --> 02:12:07.148]  This massive amount of production of gold that was going on, even at that time.
[02:12:08.608 --> 02:12:11.889]  There were new mines that were coming online every day, almost.
[02:12:12.789 --> 02:12:28.492]  Of course, I gave a little history of how Nixon had deregulated gold and all, and I said these international bankers, and particularly the Federal Reserve bankers, are the ones that were buying all the gold.
[02:12:29.891 --> 02:12:34.998]  I told the audience, I said, everybody's asking the wrong question.
[02:12:35.498 --> 02:12:39.824]  We've got this massive production of gold, and gold was about $400 at that point.
[02:12:40.525 --> 02:12:43.549]  And I said, nobody's asking the right question.
[02:12:43.649 --> 02:12:44.930]  Who's buying all the gold?
[02:12:45.171 --> 02:12:46.613]  Joe Sixpack can't buy it.
[02:12:46.673 --> 02:12:47.374]  He has to buy
[02:12:48.290 --> 02:12:48.451]  I don't
[02:13:07.003 --> 02:13:08.964]  They're paying only $0.10 an ounce.
[02:13:10.205 --> 02:13:13.508]  And of course, gold was about $400 an ounce at that point.
[02:13:14.929 --> 02:13:23.034]  So I had to explain that at that point, the Federal Reserve bankers were buying $100 Federal Reserve notes from the U.S.
[02:13:23.394 --> 02:13:31.700]  Treasury Department, or the press, the federal press there in Washington, and they were buying them for $0.02 apiece at that point.
[02:13:33.607 --> 02:13:40.849]  Again, let me comment on this, because now they're admitting in the media that the Federal Reserve is private, but they're saying, oh, it's good that they are.
[02:13:41.550 --> 02:13:42.290]  Here's the problem.
[02:13:42.330 --> 02:13:58.215]  They create these notes, these pieces of paper, they charge us for the interest, and then they use the money they create out of nothing with fractional reserve banking, and they buy up real assets like gold and airports and jumbo jets and tanks.
[02:13:58.655 --> 02:14:01.876]  Let me get a comment from Bob Chapman on that.
[02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:15.349]  Well, that's entirely true, and you can follow this each week by looking at the increases and decreases in M3, which is money and credit in general.
[02:14:16.301 --> 02:14:24.566]  And the increase this year has been 6.5 percent, but interestingly, most of the major nations are around 9 to 10 percent.
[02:14:25.066 --> 02:14:29.869]  But what the Fed does is they go into the repurchase market every day.
[02:14:30.289 --> 02:14:31.770]  They call it the repo market.
[02:14:32.010 --> 02:14:42.936]  And what they do is, as Red said, they create money out of thin air and ask the Treasury to print it at 2.6 or whatever it is per year.
[02:14:43.176 --> 02:14:44.837]  And then with money they've bought
[02:14:47.865 --> 02:14:52.948]  $100 notes and $1 notes at this point are only about $0.04 apiece coming from the press.
[02:14:53.528 --> 02:14:57.351]  And then they buy real gold for it.
[02:14:57.391 --> 02:15:06.616]  What they do is they go to a bank such as JPMorgan Chase, a bank within the Fed system, and they purchase U.S.
[02:15:06.656 --> 02:15:07.957]  government securities from them.
[02:15:08.599 --> 02:15:10.580]  With this money that they've just created.
[02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:11.200]  Yes.
[02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:21.485]  The banks then take the money and go to the agents of the Fed, who in fact are large brokerage firms such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, etc, etc.
[02:15:22.166 --> 02:15:35.592]  And they take this money and they have been told ahead of time, today you're going to rig the Dow and make it go up, you're going to make bonds go down, you're going to suppress gold and silver and oil and gas, and this is your job for the day.
[02:15:35.972 --> 02:15:36.713]  And right now,
[02:15:38.425 --> 02:15:42.530]  On an ongoing basis, the repo pulled a $71 billion.
[02:15:42.951 --> 02:15:45.354]  Yesterday they increased it by $10 billion.
[02:15:45.935 --> 02:15:53.685]  And so if you watch these figures, you can see them create money every single day, and they are manipulating all markets all over the world.
[02:15:53.905 --> 02:15:56.168]  And again, it's not free market.
[02:15:56.821 --> 02:16:06.451]  It is a tiny group of elites creating money out of nothing and buying up the world for it, and then taking your house when you don't pay back a debt that they created out of thin air.
[02:16:06.551 --> 02:16:14.640]  Folks, if you want a copy of the International Forecaster for free that covers all of this, and it's lengthy, what, 30-something pages?
[02:16:15.181 --> 02:16:16.522]  It varies month to month.
[02:16:16.902 --> 02:16:17.944]  The latest issue
[02:16:18.644 --> 02:16:19.985]  Give them a call.
[02:16:20.025 --> 02:16:21.646]  They'll give you a free copy.
[02:16:21.666 --> 02:16:22.126]  877-479-8198.
[02:16:22.146 --> 02:16:22.306]  Is that?
[02:16:22.446 --> 02:16:23.347]  That's incorrect.
[02:16:24.067 --> 02:16:24.247]  OK.
[02:16:24.267 --> 02:16:24.307]  OK.
[02:16:24.327 --> 02:16:24.307]  78.
[02:16:24.347 --> 02:16:24.427]  877-479-8178.
[02:16:24.547 --> 02:16:24.788]  OK.
[02:16:24.808 --> 02:16:24.788]  78.
[02:16:24.828 --> 02:16:24.928]  877-479-8178.
[02:16:25.208 --> 02:16:26.789]  And that's a toll-free number.
[02:16:26.809 --> 02:16:29.950]  Let me say that again slowly.
[02:16:29.970 --> 02:16:30.771]  I was going from memory. 877.
[02:16:47.312 --> 02:16:47.332]  479-8178
[02:16:53.130 --> 02:16:58.671]  877-479-8178 to get a free copy of that.
[02:16:59.252 --> 02:17:10.374]  We're going to break here, and then I want to come back and take calls from Jeff, and Kevin, and Fred, and Ed, and Bob, and everybody else that's patiently holding callers.
[02:17:10.614 --> 02:17:12.014]  Just have your question, your comment.
[02:17:12.034 --> 02:17:13.215]  We're going to move on to the next person.
[02:17:13.515 --> 02:17:15.675]  I want to give everybody a chance to get involved on air.
[02:17:16.115 --> 02:17:18.616]  Again, I want to thank both our guests, Red Beckman, grandfather,
[02:17:19.096 --> 02:17:23.277]  of the fully-informed jury movement in this country, expose the IRS as well.
[02:17:23.597 --> 02:17:29.499]  Of course, Bob Chapman, whose predictions are just spot-on, as they say, legendary.
[02:17:30.179 --> 02:17:35.080]  So we're honored to have both of these formidable minds on with us today.
[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:41.822]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, trying to give you information that's accurate, that you can use to protect yourself and your family.
[02:17:42.042 --> 02:17:43.782]  PrisonPlanet.tv, stay with us.
[02:17:45.427 --> 02:17:46.888]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[02:17:47.188 --> 02:17:51.789]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[02:17:52.110 --> 02:17:54.450]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[02:17:54.671 --> 02:17:56.211]  Achieve financial independence.
[02:17:56.591 --> 02:18:01.673]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.

[02:18:03.274 --> 02:18:05.975]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.

[02:18:20.281 --> 02:18:25.403]  I can tell you there'll be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.
[02:18:25.923 --> 02:18:31.406]  Leave the fiat currency behind and call Midas Resources to get your Red Book along with that silver dollar for only $22.95.
[02:18:31.506 --> 02:18:33.467]  Get the map.

[02:18:46.337 --> 02:18:47.378]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:18:47.699 --> 02:18:50.502]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:18:50.762 --> 02:18:54.907]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:18:55.347 --> 02:18:56.168]  So what do you do?
[02:18:56.489 --> 02:19:01.054]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:19:01.534 --> 02:19:03.676]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:19:04.156 --> 02:19:05.057]  Sheltering in Place!
[02:19:05.457 --> 02:19:18.867]  Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:19:18.907 --> 02:19:25.972]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:19:26.312 --> 02:19:30.714]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[02:19:31.154 --> 02:19:32.935]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[02:19:32.955 --> 02:19:33.175]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:19:33.255 --> 02:19:34.696]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[02:19:45.330 --> 02:19:46.810]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:19:46.891 --> 02:19:49.271]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[02:19:49.631 --> 02:19:50.512]  Let me rephrase that.
[02:19:50.872 --> 02:19:52.092]  Oil War III has started.
[02:19:52.412 --> 02:19:54.853]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[02:19:55.253 --> 02:19:58.674]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[02:19:59.074 --> 02:19:59.915]  Why else would the U.S.
[02:19:59.935 --> 02:20:02.916]  be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[02:20:03.156 --> 02:20:04.436]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[02:20:04.876 --> 02:20:09.338]  The nations of the Earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[02:20:09.778 --> 02:20:13.759]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[02:20:14.299 --> 02:20:20.183]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.
[02:20:20.443 --> 02:20:26.547]  Call Ready Reserves at 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the free booklet and what you can do to prepare.
[02:20:27.067 --> 02:20:27.648]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[02:20:27.668 --> 02:20:33.311]  After you read the booklet, you'll understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[02:20:33.751 --> 02:20:35.653]  That's 1-800-453-2202 or email your request to ReadyReserves at AOL.com.
[02:20:35.673 --> 02:20:36.013]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[02:20:44.261 --> 02:20:46.042]  By now, you've heard about DirecTV.
[02:20:46.223 --> 02:20:54.149]  You've heard that with DirecTV, you get a better value than cable, a better selection than cable, and access to exclusive programming that you can't get anywhere else.
[02:20:54.349 --> 02:20:56.591]  But for whatever reason, you thought there was a catch.
[02:20:56.871 --> 02:20:58.432]  Maybe even hidden fees.
[02:20:58.672 --> 02:21:00.273]  Well, Expert Satellite can help.
[02:21:00.514 --> 02:21:02.635]  And we've done it for hundreds of thousands already.
[02:21:02.875 --> 02:21:04.457]  Just give us a call at 1-800-655-0658.
[02:21:04.477 --> 02:21:11.422]  Within seconds, we'll compare DirecTV to your cable bill right over the phone.
[02:21:11.602 --> 02:21:18.126]  You'll be amazed that for only $39.99 per month, you get over 130 quality channels, including your locals.
[02:21:18.327 --> 02:21:20.788]  Plus, when you sign up today, there is no equipment to buy.
[02:21:20.988 --> 02:21:24.611]  We'll install a DirecTV system for up to four separate rooms, free.
[02:21:24.931 --> 02:21:29.334]  So pick up the phone and let us show you how easy and free it is to switch to DirecTV.
[02:21:29.454 --> 02:21:32.016]  Plus, get a free DVD player while supplies last.
[02:21:32.036 --> 02:21:32.416]  Just dial 1-800-655-0658.
[02:21:32.436 --> 02:21:32.676]  That's 800-655-0658.
[02:21:32.796 --> 02:21:33.517]  Call now for complete details.
[02:21:41.562 --> 02:21:54.069]  For the New World Order crowd, it isn't about, quote, making money.
[02:21:54.249 --> 02:21:55.430]  Oh, they make it all right.
[02:21:55.490 --> 02:21:56.751]  They print it out of nothing.
[02:21:57.631 --> 02:21:58.972]  And they buy up your future.
[02:21:59.953 --> 02:22:01.594]  They're in the business of control.
[02:22:01.674 --> 02:22:08.998]  Control of real commodities like gold and oil and ideas and real estate and your children's minds.
[02:22:11.747 --> 02:22:13.513]  This is the New World Order, my friends.
[02:22:15.058 --> 02:22:17.025]  And we're talking to Red Beckman, we're talking to...
[02:22:17.824 --> 02:22:21.787]  Of course, Bob Chapman, we'll give that number out again later to get a free copy of the International Forecaster.
[02:22:22.067 --> 02:22:27.632]  We'll also give you an address to get some of the videos and books that Brett Beckman's put together.
[02:22:27.992 --> 02:22:33.356]  Right now, gentlemen, let's go to calls for those that have been holding since time immemorial.
[02:22:34.317 --> 02:22:36.499]  Jeff in Indiana, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:22:36.819 --> 02:22:44.165]  It's also about destroying you by the legal system to just become subject myself to a frivolous lawsuit that's amounted to $2.7 million.
[02:22:46.285 --> 02:23:00.608]  It was a written contract dispute where another party said that they had a previous oral contract and the judge felt that he needed to control the jury to come to a ruling that ended up settling this $2.7 million.
[02:23:00.648 --> 02:23:03.589]  Can't you appeal this?
[02:23:03.909 --> 02:23:12.371]  Well I can and I can also file bankruptcy and bring it into a federal court and I've got a couple different remedies in that sense but the thing is I already have $40,000 in
[02:23:14.389 --> 02:23:16.432]  Legal expenses that will never be recovered.
[02:23:17.013 --> 02:23:23.142]  My question, I guess, to Red is, you know, what do you do to educate a jury before you go into a legal situation like that?
[02:23:23.563 --> 02:23:28.671]  Or is our best hope we're just supposed to educate the whole world as to, you know, the proper way to be on a jury?
[02:23:30.112 --> 02:23:38.358]  It's almost impossible to educate a jury where you're into a court with an admiralty or equity jurisdiction.
[02:23:39.639 --> 02:23:54.890]  This is why the 7th Amendment is so vital that we have to bring back our common law courts because in a common law court you can educate that jury right in the courtroom and explain to them their constitutionally secured right
[02:23:57.409 --> 02:24:00.571]  To judge the law and the facts in the case.
[02:24:03.853 --> 02:24:16.701]  If you're in a court where the jury is subject to the judge, that's your equity and your admiralty jurisdictions, they won't let you educate that jury in that courtroom.
[02:24:17.202 --> 02:24:19.463]  Okay, because that's exactly the situation.
[02:24:19.523 --> 02:24:20.944]  I've got a judge that, you know,
[02:24:21.348 --> 02:24:29.235]  Tell the jury that you know all the oral argument that anybody wants to put on and everything in the world can be hearsay and you're supposed to accept that as being gospel.
[02:24:29.615 --> 02:24:29.955]  Yeah.
[02:24:30.115 --> 02:24:35.520]  There's got to be some way to be able to keep control over that activist judge so that he isn't able to take
[02:24:35.845 --> 02:24:40.008]  You know, all the laws of the world and muddy them into grey to where there's just no justice for anybody.
[02:24:40.028 --> 02:24:48.673]  You know, my wife has just become drafted for jury service and I'm trying to explain to her how she's got to go in and do this in two weeks because that's the basis of our world.
[02:24:49.254 --> 02:24:54.737]  To make sure that people understand what's out there and that people, the right type of people are on juries doing the right thing.
[02:24:55.178 --> 02:24:56.478]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[02:24:56.559 --> 02:24:58.600]  Any comments, Mr. Chapman?
[02:25:00.370 --> 02:25:05.155]  Just one short one and that is the court system is not serving the people.
[02:25:06.176 --> 02:25:11.282]  It's upside down and don't expect to get a honest adjudication.
[02:25:11.462 --> 02:25:15.227]  The judges run the courts and they get the kind of decisions that they want.
[02:25:16.859 --> 02:25:20.042]  Let's talk to Kevin in Mass.
[02:25:20.102 --> 02:25:20.823]  Kevin, go ahead.
[02:25:20.843 --> 02:25:22.905]  Hi, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[02:25:22.945 --> 02:25:24.967]  I'll try to keep it to about two minutes if I can.
[02:25:25.347 --> 02:25:25.747]  Go ahead.
[02:25:26.788 --> 02:25:32.954]  Revelation chapter 13 verses 16 through 18 tell you that Satan's going to force everyone to take the Mark of the Beast.
[02:25:33.154 --> 02:25:39.800]  Revelation 14 verses 9 through 12 say that anyone that takes it does not enter Heaven.
[02:25:40.191 --> 02:25:42.872]  We are fighting an Infowar, but it's a real war.
[02:25:42.912 --> 02:25:52.657]  When I heard Red Beckman saying how you are having such a powerful effect and that the criminals in our government are afraid of us and how, you know, the people are waking up, I wanted to call in.
[02:25:53.017 --> 02:25:55.838]  I called in to NPR another time and got through.
[02:25:55.858 --> 02:25:59.900]  I actually was able to get the website, Infowars.com, out there.
[02:26:00.020 --> 02:26:02.021]  And the whole call is just a little over a minute.
[02:26:02.061 --> 02:26:06.803]  I was wondering if I could play my exchange where they were promoting Blair with Dick Gordon.
[02:26:07.892 --> 02:26:11.034]  This was off the website for their archive.
[02:26:11.435 --> 02:26:13.216]  Hold on one second.
[02:26:13.236 --> 02:26:14.797]  423-8255, that's our number.
[02:26:15.077 --> 02:26:16.338]  Next to Medford, Massachusetts.
[02:26:16.358 --> 02:26:16.838]  Cliff's with us.
[02:26:16.858 --> 02:26:17.218]  Hi, Cliff.
[02:26:17.659 --> 02:26:17.839]  Hi.
[02:26:18.419 --> 02:26:19.460]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:26.444]  I think Bush is receiving Blair because Blair and Bush, Bush is the only real reliable foreign ally in the war.
[02:26:26.464 --> 02:26:28.946]  They have a symbiotic relationship where they prop each other up.
[02:26:29.686 --> 02:26:31.988]  They've always shared a uniquely close relationship.
[02:26:32.688 --> 02:26:35.410]  I mean, George Bush is the, you know, 18th
[02:26:36.383 --> 02:26:38.785]  Great-grandson of Robert II of Scotland.
[02:26:39.006 --> 02:26:43.009]  They literally have some blood relatives if you go back far enough.
[02:26:44.071 --> 02:26:48.034]  I also think that... And are you saying that that's a good thing for the countries then?
[02:26:48.615 --> 02:27:00.927]  Regardless of what today's political demands draw them together, is it a good thing for America and Britain, and by extension Europe, that they do have this need for each other?
[02:27:02.156 --> 02:27:03.898]  Well, I don't know whether it's good or bad.
[02:27:04.218 --> 02:27:07.361]  I think it is why they both receive each other.
[02:27:08.061 --> 02:27:15.888]  America separated from England back in the Revolutionary War, but with World War I, World War II, they've continued right up through today to move closer.
[02:27:17.148 --> 02:27:25.010]  Blair had Dr. Kelly suicided for Bush's weapons of mass destruction excuse for war, and they both serve the same autography of New World bankers.
[02:27:25.070 --> 02:27:32.772]  If you go to Infowars.com, you can see that they go to Bohemian Grove, and there's these Christians who worship Moloch and Baal.
[02:27:32.792 --> 02:27:33.353]  Ha ha ha!
[02:27:33.373 --> 02:27:34.133]  That's awesome!
[02:27:35.333 --> 02:27:36.333]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.713 --> 02:27:38.354]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.254 --> 02:27:41.915]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.146 --> 02:27:48.188]  You and your family members getting enough minerals in the daily diet?
[02:27:48.569 --> 02:27:51.050]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[02:27:51.311 --> 02:27:58.376]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[02:27:58.576 --> 02:28:01.858]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[02:28:02.098 --> 02:28:04.140]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[02:28:04.480 --> 02:28:12.306]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[02:28:12.546 --> 02:28:13.847]  Either way, why chance it?
[02:28:13.947 --> 02:28:23.894]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call to Sea Minerals at 877-835-5555, and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost to the immune system.

[02:28:45.288 --> 02:28:48.291]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:28:48.651 --> 02:28:57.458]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:28:57.778 --> 02:29:02.462]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:29:02.922 --> 02:29:09.645]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:29:10.045 --> 02:29:21.811]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[02:30:37.445 --> 02:30:38.746]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:38.786 --> 02:30:39.706]  Before we go back to calls,
[02:30:55.567 --> 02:31:02.429]  And just cover some of the topical news of the day and get the perspectives of Red Beckman and Bob Chapman.
[02:31:02.889 --> 02:31:08.650]  Red, you offer a little booklet that's excellent, Walls and Our Minds, for just a couple dollars.
[02:31:08.710 --> 02:31:09.851]  It's a great little booklet.
[02:31:10.511 --> 02:31:12.151]  And I suggest people get it from you.
[02:31:12.191 --> 02:31:12.871]  How do they do that?
[02:31:13.512 --> 02:31:22.974]  Well, we say, I do this on talk shows, anyone who will send us three $1 bills, we'll send them a copy of this book.
[02:31:23.818 --> 02:31:51.276]  And, uh, my address now is, uh, Common Sense Press, uh, just C- P- C- C- S- P, and it's P-O-Box-6-1, Carrolls, Washington, C-A-R-R-O-L-L-S, Washington, 9-8-6-0-9, and if they'll send me three one dollar bills, it'll, the book'll come first class,
[02:31:51.952 --> 02:31:55.333]  We don't make any money on it, because the postage is well over a dollar.
[02:31:56.873 --> 02:32:03.494]  But it'll come first class, and you'll get a list of all of our books and tapes that are available.
[02:32:03.954 --> 02:32:05.395]  Yeah, it's some amazing stuff.
[02:32:05.435 --> 02:32:07.275]  We've aired a lot of your videos here locally.
[02:32:07.995 --> 02:32:09.616]  Give folks that address one more time, please.
[02:32:10.516 --> 02:32:10.776]  What?
[02:32:11.496 --> 02:32:13.156]  Give people your address, please, again.
[02:32:13.376 --> 02:32:14.857]  Yes, it's P.O.
[02:32:14.877 --> 02:32:18.857]  Box 61, Carrolls, Washington.
[02:32:19.478 --> 02:32:21.078]  That's C-A-R-R.
[02:32:22.359 --> 02:32:25.001]  O-L-L-L-S, Washington.
[02:32:25.021 --> 02:32:27.764]  W-A, that's the initial.
[02:32:28.244 --> 02:32:31.447]  And the zip code is 98609.
[02:32:31.647 --> 02:32:34.029]  And that's addressed to Red Beckman.
[02:32:34.309 --> 02:32:38.813]  And one more time, folks, if you want a free copy of the International Forecaster,
[02:32:39.779 --> 02:32:49.064]  The network's giving them out for free, thanks to Bob Chapman letting us do that.
[02:32:49.845 --> 02:32:53.327]  It's 877-479-8178.
[02:32:53.347 --> 02:32:54.027]  877-479-8178.
[02:32:56.669 --> 02:32:58.930]  We already got Red's comment on this as a veteran.
[02:32:59.110 --> 02:33:04.493]  I know that Bob Chapman is a veteran with military intelligence, army intelligence.
[02:33:05.114 --> 02:33:08.756]  In the past, we weren't known for killing wounded people.
[02:33:09.842 --> 02:33:20.550]  A day after they've taken over a mosque, another group of Marines went in to relieve the others, and they just walk over with pleasure to somebody, these guys are all bleeding to death, some already dead, and shoot the guy.
[02:33:21.110 --> 02:33:27.395]  Bob, I thought they were bad because they shot our wounded people, but how is it good if our troops do that?
[02:33:28.095 --> 02:33:31.578]  And number two, NBC is embedded.
[02:33:32.313 --> 02:33:37.237]  Nothing is released that the Pentagon doesn't want released out of NBC or CBS or Fox or ABC.
[02:33:37.757 --> 02:33:40.499]  I believe they're releasing it to enrage the Arabs.
[02:33:40.519 --> 02:33:51.348]  We even have Pentagon memos on this, like P-2-O-G, to cause the Arabs to fight more, to spread the war, so the globalists can keep the war going longer and make more hundreds of billions each year.
[02:33:51.408 --> 02:33:51.848]  Your comment.
[02:33:52.944 --> 02:34:02.029]  I agree with you completely, and of course there's no justification for shooting anybody who's down and out and, you know, probably ready to die anyway.
[02:34:02.909 --> 02:34:09.652]  And I've never seen that happen in warfare that I've been involved in, although I'm sure it does.
[02:34:10.613 --> 02:34:14.375]  People get enraged in warfare, and sometimes rightly so.
[02:34:15.109 --> 02:34:19.451]  But I do think that they want to spread the war further.
[02:34:19.471 --> 02:34:28.035]  They were just taken aback when Iran decided that they were not going to develop anything in the nuclear area.
[02:34:28.415 --> 02:34:31.977]  And so they don't have a ready excuse to invade Iran.
[02:34:32.017 --> 02:34:35.298]  So what you're saying is logical.
[02:34:35.958 --> 02:34:38.139]  And I know they want to extend the war.
[02:34:38.480 --> 02:34:43.702]  And I also know, like you do, that they also want to implement a draft
[02:34:44.344 --> 02:34:51.071]  For two reasons, so they'll have enough troops to do all the invading they want, and also to control the young people of the country.
[02:34:51.771 --> 02:34:59.379]  And on top of that, when we look at what happened there, yes, in war, prisoners get shot sometimes, but people get in trouble for it.
[02:34:59.499 --> 02:35:00.800]  You know, we're supposedly the good guys.
[02:35:01.521 --> 02:35:06.466]  But the point here is, the story is the defense of this guy, and Marine Corps officers,
[02:35:07.176 --> 02:35:12.897]  You know, saying, these aren't human beings, they deserve to die, so what?
[02:35:13.737 --> 02:35:16.318]  And the public defending it, that's the change.
[02:35:17.278 --> 02:35:18.198]  Well, it's disgusting.
[02:35:18.859 --> 02:35:22.979]  Yeah, it was no accident that there was a camera there to catch that.
[02:35:24.800 --> 02:35:27.721]  Well, NBC admittedly, the Pentagon let them release this!
[02:35:29.501 --> 02:35:34.302]  And so, it just, it's PR, it's public relations,
[02:35:35.118 --> 02:35:45.243]  And you know, we might not understand all their motivation and all that, but I can assure you it was not good Americanism that caused it.
[02:35:46.884 --> 02:35:47.985]  Let's take a call.
[02:35:48.065 --> 02:35:54.888]  Let's go ahead and talk to... I want to tell Kevin and Mass, good job on that National NPR show.
[02:35:54.948 --> 02:35:55.589]  That was great.
[02:35:56.869 --> 02:35:57.930]  Let's talk to Fred.
[02:35:58.864 --> 02:35:59.845]  In Pennsylvania.
[02:35:59.865 --> 02:36:02.346]  No, no, Fred's calling from... Fred, where are you calling us from?
[02:36:02.466 --> 02:36:03.146]  Philadelphia.
[02:36:03.246 --> 02:36:04.127]  Philadelphia, go ahead.
[02:36:04.407 --> 02:36:13.992]  Okay, I mean, I could go with so many things, geopolitical or law enforcement, but let me go with this law enforcement and focus on search warrants.
[02:36:16.493 --> 02:36:26.138]  I came across something, I'm not absolutely sure, but I came across something around 1990, just a personal experience in my own life, where
[02:36:26.738 --> 02:36:37.141]  There are on a local basis, like cities, big cities or counties, local law enforcement has access to search warrant mills.
[02:36:38.482 --> 02:36:42.163]  These search warrants, and I would estimate that it's been
[02:36:42.884 --> 02:36:45.786]  Well, this is a serious, serious problem, and the American people had better wake up
[02:37:06.648 --> 02:37:10.370]  And pay attention because no one is safe.
[02:37:11.551 --> 02:37:14.733]  No one is immune.
[02:37:16.834 --> 02:37:28.040]  We had a case in Montana where the law enforcement people, they went and planted drugs in a place after they had the search warrant.
[02:37:28.810 --> 02:37:32.631]  And this is, you know, just one of their tricks.
[02:37:32.771 --> 02:37:36.812]  And boy, they can get anybody they really want to get, it seems.
[02:37:37.533 --> 02:37:38.473]  And that's what they're doing.
[02:37:38.513 --> 02:37:39.513]  That's how they're doing it.
[02:37:39.933 --> 02:37:57.078]  Well, I also wanted to mention that you had, in Montana, I want to listen to the Gordon Liddy Show, I guess about 12 years ago, you had a woman call up named Jessica, and they had raided a preparedness group in Montana.
[02:37:58.122 --> 02:38:03.245]  Uh, with a, uh, a piece of paper, but it didn't really, it didn't have a judge's signature at the bottom.
[02:38:03.265 --> 02:38:05.626]  Yeah, they do that, they do that all the time, but I mean... Alright.
[02:38:05.926 --> 02:38:07.146]  But, but, but thanks for the call.
[02:38:07.667 --> 02:38:17.431]  Uh, speaking of spying on you, 400,000 truck drivers, cable men and women, phone people, uh, the gas meter reader, carpet cleaners.
[02:38:18.191 --> 02:38:21.373]  The cops aren't supposed to come in without a warrant, but then their warrants are flimsy.
[02:38:22.515 --> 02:38:28.400]  But now we have this thing, which has been going on for decades, but now it's public, of quote, fighting terror and crime under Homeland Security.
[02:38:28.821 --> 02:38:31.663]  Oh, spy on people when they're in the house.
[02:38:32.224 --> 02:38:36.067]  Or, if you see a man and woman arguing on the side of the street, call the police.
[02:38:36.228 --> 02:38:39.130]  These are the things in the information booklets they're being given.
[02:38:39.611 --> 02:38:42.553]  The TIPS program was actually expanded under a new name.
[02:38:42.894 --> 02:38:43.995]  Bob Chapman comments?
[02:38:46.083 --> 02:38:56.874]  I think it's all part and parcel of the extension of the Patriot Act, and I think it's just going to get considerably worse, and we're going to become prisoners in our own country.
[02:38:58.155 --> 02:38:58.795]  Absolutely.
[02:38:58.815 --> 02:39:00.317]  Thanks for the call, Fred.
[02:39:00.337 --> 02:39:05.562]  We're going to go to Ed and Bob, and maybe one more caller here in a second, but I've got a couple different articles I want to get
[02:39:06.155 --> 02:39:07.556]  Your take on here, gentlemen.
[02:39:07.876 --> 02:39:14.258]  Ohio recount all but certain third-party candidates raise enough cash to demand another tally of the state's votes.
[02:39:14.278 --> 02:39:18.159]  World and Daily, the Green Party and the Libertarian Party, are doing this.
[02:39:18.179 --> 02:39:31.303]  But the problem is, the same guy, Mr. Blackwell, their Secretary of State, who wouldn't count 400,000 provisional ballots that were obviously for Kerry, they admit, well, Bush only won by 130,000 votes.
[02:39:31.624 --> 02:39:35.165]  But we can't get a real recount because the same people are over the recount.
[02:39:35.205 --> 02:39:35.585]  Comments?
[02:39:37.819 --> 02:39:48.448]  Well, I don't think that they have any intention of doing anything, and no matter how much money you collect to make the demand for a recount, you're not going to get it.
[02:39:49.029 --> 02:39:49.930]  They do what they want to do.
[02:39:49.950 --> 02:39:55.114]  Yeah, well, I had mentioned earlier, when I ran for governor in Montana in 1988,
[02:39:56.798 --> 02:40:04.185]  Uh, that we had all of the vote fraud and it was so well documented and, uh, and so, I mean, the evidence was so solid.
[02:40:04.705 --> 02:40:10.991]  But the Secretary of State, of course, when this was presented to him, he said, oh, we gotta do something.
[02:40:11.031 --> 02:40:11.972]  We can't have this.
[02:40:12.532 --> 02:40:13.613]  But nothing was done.
[02:40:13.953 --> 02:40:24.159]  Okay, in the last two weeks, a woman selling knock-off Rubik's Cubes, they admit were legal, was visited by two Homeland Security officers at her tiny business in St.
[02:40:24.219 --> 02:40:25.220]  Helens, Oregon.
[02:40:25.740 --> 02:40:30.984]  They told her with no judge's order, no nothing, take it off the shelf or you'll be arrested under terrorism.
[02:40:31.004 --> 02:40:33.005]  That was in the Associated Press, but we interviewed her.
[02:40:34.004 --> 02:40:38.927]  Then a doctor, a veteran of Gulf War I, called and complained too much.
[02:40:40.028 --> 02:40:49.433]  The Quad City Times reported that the Homeland Security officer admitted that he didn't threaten anybody, but calling too much was an act of terrorism.
[02:40:50.514 --> 02:40:51.955]  And so we have these examples.
[02:40:51.975 --> 02:40:52.795]  Well, here's a new one.
[02:40:52.915 --> 02:40:53.156]  U.S.
[02:40:53.196 --> 02:40:55.797]  citizenship, no bar to terror screening.
[02:40:56.257 --> 02:41:02.221]  Five government anti-terrorism agents arrived at the door of Nancy Swift's modest home in the northern Virginia suburb last August.
[02:41:02.836 --> 02:41:05.119]  Where Swift lives and rents out some rooms.
[02:41:06.321 --> 02:41:07.783]  They threatened her with a subpoena.
[02:41:07.943 --> 02:41:11.429]  They disrupted and dispatched agents to her office to ask about her.
[02:41:11.709 --> 02:41:17.718]  They took away her garbage in trucks with their cars and they questioned one of her housemates.
[02:41:18.655 --> 02:41:22.837]  Turns out that Swift had a Middle Eastern man living there with no terror connections.
[02:41:23.097 --> 02:41:25.598]  He had Middle Eastern friends over for a holiday weekend.
[02:41:25.878 --> 02:41:37.384]  The neighbor who complained on Herb and who turned Swift into the county government also has complained in the past on code violations of her grass being too tall.
[02:41:37.824 --> 02:41:39.905]  So this is the new mentality.
[02:41:39.945 --> 02:41:40.365]  Comments?
[02:41:42.806 --> 02:41:45.968]  Well that's why I'm receiving about 300 requests a month
[02:41:47.059 --> 02:41:51.043]  By people who are looking for alternative destinations in which to live.
[02:41:53.386 --> 02:41:57.550]  But you can't run because it's a New World Order, Red Beckman comments.
[02:41:57.711 --> 02:41:58.532]  Where can you go?
[02:41:58.552 --> 02:42:02.816]  Where can you go that the New World Order isn't there?
[02:42:05.396 --> 02:42:12.059]  Well, I think that you're both right, but the point is that people, it's just a reflection of people's anxiety.
[02:42:12.179 --> 02:42:13.079]  They don't know what to do.
[02:42:13.099 --> 02:42:15.940]  They think that perhaps moving somewhere else will help.
[02:42:16.221 --> 02:42:17.141]  Well, you're right, Bob.
[02:42:17.661 --> 02:42:23.964]  Record numbers of people wanting to immigrate to Canada, New Zealand, Australia, but they're jumping out of a frying pan into the furnace.
[02:42:25.976 --> 02:42:32.681]  Yeah, I've had good friends that have left the country and have settled elsewhere.
[02:42:33.301 --> 02:42:44.588]  And it takes a little while for them, but eventually they find out that they have jumped from the frying pan into the fire.
[02:42:45.949 --> 02:42:50.912]  But it takes a little time because their first impression is that they are freer right now.
[02:42:52.060 --> 02:42:57.262]  I'd say that people are more free in Russia than they are in the United States.
[02:42:58.582 --> 02:42:59.322]  Unbelievable.
[02:43:00.243 --> 02:43:01.043]  Some good news.
[02:43:01.843 --> 02:43:10.206]  50 conservative groups and liberal groups have gotten together decrying this new national ID card that we already have at the state level, as well as Patriot Act 2.
[02:43:10.566 --> 02:43:15.707]  Major pressure on this bill that could leave the Congress as early as next week and go to the President's desk.
[02:43:16.408 --> 02:43:17.588]  Any comments on that, gentlemen?
[02:43:20.242 --> 02:43:27.105]  Well, I believe that they'll do everything they can to pass it, and they own most of Congress because they buy them off.
[02:43:27.826 --> 02:43:33.409]  And that's why we see bill after bill getting passed that most of us disagree with.
[02:43:34.309 --> 02:43:37.551]  And they will continue to do it, and I hope they're successful.
[02:43:38.291 --> 02:43:41.873]  This group of conservatives and liberals have gotten together in stopping it.
[02:43:42.580 --> 02:43:47.244]  But these people are bound and determined to make it happen if it has to be by edict.
[02:43:47.644 --> 02:43:49.446]  Here's another question I have for both of you.
[02:43:49.746 --> 02:43:51.848]  Alberto, I love Torture Gonzalez.
[02:43:51.868 --> 02:43:56.391]  He's the guy that wrote the memos to the Pentagon saying, don't worry, go ahead and torture people.
[02:43:56.912 --> 02:44:02.897]  We are above the law, international and federal, that the president's under Congress, folks.
[02:44:05.076 --> 02:44:14.325]  This is the guy who openly said the President makes the law, he is the law, he's also the architect of the enemy combatant designation, saying they can secretly arrest American citizens.
[02:44:14.365 --> 02:44:14.765]  Comments?
[02:44:16.407 --> 02:44:22.833]  This does not surprise me at all, and of course it's going to be interesting when the Senate
[02:44:23.706 --> 02:44:28.891]  Takes up his confirmation whether he's going to be confirmed as the new Attorney General.
[02:44:30.672 --> 02:44:34.756]  I think they probably will because of the name, his Hispanic name.
[02:44:35.616 --> 02:44:42.883]  They're going to be perhaps afraid to be in too much opposition because they might be called a racist or something.
[02:44:43.443 --> 02:44:48.668]  But the man is probably far more dangerous than the one that just resigned.
[02:44:49.639 --> 02:44:51.260]  Well, this is the guy that was the brain!
[02:44:51.320 --> 02:44:58.042]  I wrote an article for this week's International Forecast, a forecast that we publish weekly by Internet.
[02:44:58.863 --> 02:45:02.644]  And I went over some of the things that you said, Alex, and some others.
[02:45:03.524 --> 02:45:18.170]  And one of the things, too, that this man is very, very positive or behind, and that is illegal immigration and the citizenship for the 15 million illegals that are in our country.
[02:45:19.455 --> 02:45:24.858]  I know, and plus he doesn't want to tell parents when your 12 year old is having an abortion, he's for gun control.
[02:45:25.318 --> 02:45:28.320]  And conservatives are just, oh we love him, it's just like they love Arnold.
[02:45:28.860 --> 02:45:29.080]  Yeah.
[02:45:29.480 --> 02:45:32.181]  At least people aren't conservatives, believe me.
[02:45:32.582 --> 02:45:32.902]  I know.
[02:45:34.142 --> 02:45:36.904]  Must wear student IDs, fight
[02:45:38.038 --> 02:45:44.583]  In town, Christian Science Monitor, a few years ago in Louisiana, a big school, first five kids, then ten, then a hundred.
[02:45:45.084 --> 02:45:47.586]  They all said, we're not wearing IDs, they had to remove them.
[02:45:48.086 --> 02:45:52.309]  Well now, Christian Science Monitor, popular Polar Bluff, Missouri.
[02:45:52.910 --> 02:45:58.034]  There's usually not much to report from the town of 17,000 in the foothills of southeastern Missouri.
[02:45:58.911 --> 02:46:08.781]  Crime is low, traffic is slow, and the locals like to point visitors to the town's namesake, a blanket of tulip polar trees hugging the bluff of the Black River.
[02:46:09.361 --> 02:46:22.514]  But 1,300 students cram the hallways of the bluff's only public school, and Superintendent Randy Winston is the first to admit that it is nearly impossible to know anybody by face, let alone by name.
[02:46:23.587 --> 02:46:33.492]  Then it goes on, and yet, when he announced in late October that all students and staff must wear ID badges while on school grounds, a few parents and then a slew of students put up quite a fuss.
[02:46:33.892 --> 02:46:37.254]  Some called it Orwellian, citing Big Brother and his omnipresent eye.
[02:46:37.314 --> 02:46:40.275]  Others declared it a nuisance, saying only visitors should have to wear badges.
[02:46:40.655 --> 02:46:43.637]  One father even pulled his two daughters out of the school in protest.
[02:46:44.737 --> 02:46:47.059]  I just hope that they stick to their guns and there's going to be some pressure on them.
[02:47:05.188 --> 02:47:09.930]  They're going to, uh, you know, have pressure put on them because of their stand.
[02:47:10.570 --> 02:47:18.033]  And, uh, I just hope and pray that they, uh, stand firm and, uh, you know, don't, don't give in.
[02:47:18.674 --> 02:47:19.714]  But here's the excuse.
[02:47:19.994 --> 02:47:23.335]  Many residents feel immune to everything from street crime to terror attacks.
[02:47:23.656 --> 02:47:25.876]  Perhaps the community is merely going through growing pains.
[02:47:25.977 --> 02:47:26.817]  Oh, we're growing!
[02:47:27.177 --> 02:47:32.179]  Observers note, it's a struggle we have to come to terms with, with the new normal.
[02:47:33.600 --> 02:47:33.760]  Hmm.
[02:47:34.040 --> 02:47:34.300]  Bob?
[02:47:35.572 --> 02:47:36.492]  Insanity.
[02:47:37.193 --> 02:47:43.415]  But another method of controlling people, this control, control, control.
[02:47:44.015 --> 02:47:51.437]  We started the Soviet Union and the National Socialist Germany in the 1930s, and we're seeing it again here.
[02:47:52.538 --> 02:47:57.279]  Our government is a National Socialist government, and there's just no two ways about it.
[02:47:58.420 --> 02:48:01.921]  We're censoring as much, our government is censoring as much as they can.
[02:48:02.941 --> 02:48:04.821]  Including books out of the Middle East.
[02:48:04.921 --> 02:48:09.382]  I mean, when I see book burners, I know we get some bad people about.
[02:48:10.902 --> 02:48:13.343]  Alright, we're going to come back and hit one or two final callers.
[02:48:14.503 --> 02:48:17.744]  With our guests, Red Blackman and of course, Bob Chapman.
[02:48:20.124 --> 02:48:25.045]  I hope that all of you who are listening will realize that everything we've been talking about is documented.
[02:48:25.065 --> 02:48:29.005]  This country is being dismantled before our very eyes.
[02:48:29.085 --> 02:48:32.046]  Speaking of the National Draft, former G.I.s ordered to war.
[02:48:34.102 --> 02:48:35.165]  are saying they're not going to go.
[02:48:35.205 --> 02:48:37.389]  People who served 20 years are being ordered back.
[02:48:37.910 --> 02:48:39.554]  That's a draft by any other name.
[02:48:39.614 --> 02:48:40.235]  It's still a draft.
[02:48:40.696 --> 02:48:41.378]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:41.458 --> 02:48:43.763]  PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.net.
[02:48:45.077 --> 02:48:46.598]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:46.758 --> 02:48:49.861]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:49.981 --> 02:48:53.883]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:53.923 --> 02:48:58.166]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:58.527 --> 02:49:02.289]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:02.429 --> 02:49:04.231]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.732 --> 02:49:12.479]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:12.659 --> 02:49:15.702]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:15.862 --> 02:49:18.745]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:19.226 --> 02:49:25.352]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:25.872 --> 02:49:29.657]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:51:47.641 --> 02:51:52.509]  Folks, remember the engineer for the big company that certified steel for the World Trade Center?
[02:51:52.810 --> 02:51:57.397]  Saying it's impossible that they've done their test, that steel doesn't melt at those temperatures?
[02:51:59.240 --> 02:51:59.421]  Well...
[02:52:01.641 --> 02:52:07.005]  We've been trying to get a hold of him and his work, and now we're getting conflicting reports from his work that he's been let go.
[02:52:07.025 --> 02:52:10.428]  So we'll see if that's, in truth, accurate.
[02:52:10.448 --> 02:52:11.549]  That's what callers are saying.
[02:52:11.849 --> 02:52:12.610]  We don't know that.
[02:52:12.950 --> 02:52:14.472]  We'll have that for you tonight or tomorrow.
[02:52:14.512 --> 02:52:15.452]  I mean, obviously tomorrow.

[02:53:04.286 --> 02:53:05.287]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:53:05.327 --> 02:53:15.194]  In fact, you are having a lot of impact on the national news media because I heard them badmouthing you on some national shows, which means it's a good thing.
[02:53:27.746 --> 02:53:29.608]  Oh, who's been bad-mouthing me lately?
[02:53:29.648 --> 02:53:32.230]  There was a guy out in, I heard him on the internet.
[02:53:32.270 --> 02:53:33.531]  He's got a big show in St.
[02:53:33.551 --> 02:53:34.332]  Louis.
[02:53:34.752 --> 02:53:35.873]  Oh, I forget his name there.
[02:53:36.593 --> 02:53:39.276]  It's on KMOX, that batch of folks.
[02:53:39.796 --> 02:53:42.278]  And, um, Grayson is his name.
[02:53:42.845 --> 02:53:45.906]  And I heard him bad-mouthing you, I think it was about a week ago.
[02:53:45.926 --> 02:53:46.646]  Oh, good!
[02:53:46.946 --> 02:53:47.987]  What else is on your mind?
[02:53:48.147 --> 02:53:51.548]  Well, okay, Red, you are right about Russia.
[02:53:51.668 --> 02:53:57.030]  In fact, it was reported in the American Free Press newspaper, the real reason they threw David Duke in jail.
[02:53:57.170 --> 02:54:02.752]  And he is over in Russia, after the release in the English language of his book, Jewish Supremacism.
[02:54:03.132 --> 02:54:04.933]  And that's why I called you today, Alex.
[02:54:06.153 --> 02:54:10.855]  The fact is that Colonel Don DeGrand Prix has also, Donald, what was he talking about?
[02:54:11.220 --> 02:54:15.662]  9-11 being a coup, but he has talked about the brewing counter-coup.
[02:54:16.183 --> 02:54:19.725]  And I think we're seeing signs of that with this CIA supposed shake-up.
[02:54:19.785 --> 02:54:23.046]  What it is, is Porter Goss trying to run out some patriots there.
[02:54:23.407 --> 02:54:32.772]  And the fact is, is that the Israeli Mossad, I don't know if you know this Alex, but New Zealand's President Helen Clark, last September, cut off diplomatic relations with Israel.
[02:54:32.832 --> 02:54:34.393]  No, I know, they call it infiltrators.
[02:54:35.113 --> 02:54:36.594]  I gotta let you go, let me just say this.
[02:54:37.274 --> 02:54:40.037]  Everybody knows, I don't think the New World Order is a Jewish conspiracy.
[02:54:40.338 --> 02:54:41.259]  Are there Jews involved?
[02:54:41.279 --> 02:54:42.480]  Is there Jewish organized crime?
[02:54:42.540 --> 02:54:43.722]  Is there German organized crime?
[02:54:44.162 --> 02:54:44.482]  Yes.
[02:54:44.743 --> 02:54:52.712]  But, clearly, Israel is spying and blackmailing, and so are the British, and this is what our government does, and it's out of control, and it's bad.
[02:54:54.332 --> 02:55:02.274]  But look, I don't agree with David Duke, but I agree that he shouldn't be arrested for his political views, like Ernst Zundel, a political prisoner for his views.
[02:55:02.514 --> 02:55:09.935]  Because if they can arrest them, they can arrest us for our views about anything, like the arrest of that guy for having a shirt that said, Peace on Earth against the war.
[02:55:10.416 --> 02:55:13.416]  Final comments on this from Red Beckman and Bob Jetman.
[02:55:14.916 --> 02:55:22.098]  You know, no one has really done a real thorough and a complete job of identifying or defining terrorism.
[02:55:22.853 --> 02:55:29.040]  Terrorism is practiced more by governments.
[02:55:29.320 --> 02:55:32.423]  Governments are the worst terrorists in all of history.
[02:55:32.984 --> 02:55:37.108]  Always have been and always will be the worst terrorists.
[02:55:37.589 --> 02:55:40.191]  What we are, are anti-terrorists.
[02:55:41.252 --> 02:55:42.534]  We're anti-terrorism.
[02:55:42.654 --> 02:55:44.476]  I don't like government terrorism.
[02:55:45.340 --> 02:55:54.186]  And I think we need to, you know, really harp on this fact that governments are the ones that practice terrorism.
[02:55:54.226 --> 02:55:57.588]  The IRS has been a... they are psycho-terrorists.
[02:55:57.628 --> 02:55:58.309]  That's what I... I hear you.
[02:55:58.549 --> 02:56:00.510]  Red Beckman, I want to thank you for joining us today.
[02:56:00.550 --> 02:56:01.571]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:56:01.591 --> 02:56:03.412]  We'll have you back up again soon.
[02:56:03.452 --> 02:56:05.293]  And Bob Chapman, thank you for coming on.
[02:56:05.333 --> 02:56:06.014]  Final comments?
[02:56:07.813 --> 02:56:16.097]  I agree with Red, and I just think that people have to become aware that the people of Washington are trying to put us into a police state.
[02:56:16.558 --> 02:56:19.039]  And they're doing a good job of it, and we better stop them fast.
[02:56:20.079 --> 02:56:23.281]  Sorry to Bob and Rick and everybody else we didn't have a chance to get to.
[02:56:23.721 --> 02:56:31.645]  Back tonight, 9 to Midnight Central, on your shortwave at 3210, during the day at 9.985, or InfoWars.com, or your local AM or FM.
[02:56:32.025 --> 02:56:33.566]  Now get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:33.586 --> 02:56:33.986]  God bless.
