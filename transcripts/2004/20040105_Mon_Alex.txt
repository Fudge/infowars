[00:00:05.717 --> 00:00:09.898]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.558 --> 00:00:11.358]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.138 --> 00:00:13.019]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:17.320]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.941]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:37.953]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:39.014 --> 00:00:41.616]  It is January 5th, 2004.
[00:00:43.478 --> 00:00:47.141]  On this live Monday edition, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:56.930]  We have a doctor coming on the show in the next hour who's speaking out against a new New Jersey law that legalizes human cloning.
[00:00:58.047 --> 00:01:05.349]  And the industrialization of growing the clones and using them for parts.
[00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:12.771]  So, you talk about dehumanization, a brave new world, this is it, we'll be going over it.
[00:01:14.831 --> 00:01:20.292]  Before I launch into all the news, I don't want to forget to do this today because it's so important.
[00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:26.794]  George W. Bush is a complete and total phony.
[00:01:28.186 --> 00:01:30.848]  George Bush isn't even the president of this country.
[00:01:32.088 --> 00:01:39.432]  He is just a front man for the private, run-for-profit, military-industrial crime syndicate.
[00:01:40.973 --> 00:01:49.078]  And this weekend, listening to talk radio, I heard the big national host, two separate ones, praising him.
[00:01:49.418 --> 00:01:51.599]  Oh, he got some quail!
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.521]  Oh, he's such a hunter!
[00:01:55.387 --> 00:01:58.750]  Did you see him with that chainsaw?
[00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.791]  He's such a Texan.
[00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:08.237]  I mean, this would be like if I went to New York and started talking about what a great New Yorker I am.
[00:02:08.657 --> 00:02:09.658]  I'm tired of it, folks.
[00:02:09.778 --> 00:02:19.365]  It's admitted that the Crawford Ranch is a set, complete with old tractors, hay bales, everything.
[00:02:19.525 --> 00:02:20.466]  It is a set.
[00:02:21.545 --> 00:02:28.789]  And a couple times a year, Bush goes out with a chainsaw, a giant chainsaw, and will cut one-inch trees.
[00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.951]  And it's just mindless.
[00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:33.272]  I'm just sick of it.
[00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:35.994]  Oh, he's such a good country boy.
[00:02:37.334 --> 00:02:38.855]  He's like John Wayne.
[00:02:39.436 --> 00:02:41.237]  I can't handle any more of it, folks.
[00:02:41.397 --> 00:02:45.859]  I'm a, I don't know, 6th, 7th-plus generation Texan.
[00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:46.820]  I think more than that.
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.060]  What, 18, 29?
[00:02:49.105 --> 00:02:55.867]  Spanish land grants, 1830, on my father's side of the family, my mother's side, German immigrants in the 1840s.
[00:02:56.427 --> 00:03:00.728]  And it doesn't matter, but it's just a symptom of all the other phoniness.
[00:03:00.868 --> 00:03:10.270]  The turkey put together by some chef, presented to the troops, no one was allowed to eat it.
[00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:16.712]  The fable of Jessica Lynch, that being a fabrication.
[00:03:17.928 --> 00:03:21.752]  Bush and the Made in USA boxes behind him last year.
[00:03:21.772 --> 00:03:24.014]  Up in St.
[00:03:24.074 --> 00:03:24.514]  Louis.
[00:03:24.794 --> 00:03:25.715]  Made in USA.
[00:03:25.735 --> 00:03:28.237]  It was really made in China.
[00:03:29.238 --> 00:03:31.320]  My point is, it's an illusion.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.102]  It was an illusion with Bill Clinton.
[00:03:33.462 --> 00:03:36.505]  It's an illusion with George Bush and so many people.
[00:03:36.945 --> 00:03:39.747]  I mean, they think, wow, he's out hunting for quail.
[00:03:39.787 --> 00:03:41.329]  He must be pro-Second Amendment.
[00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:43.851]  That's what this neocon was saying this weekend.
[00:03:45.151 --> 00:03:47.992]  Then I flip channels, hear another one praising him.
[00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:50.193]  Oh, he's so wonderful.
[00:03:50.513 --> 00:03:54.015]  You know how hard it is to shoot quail.
[00:03:54.075 --> 00:03:55.536]  He's so manly.
[00:03:56.736 --> 00:04:00.138]  Shooting quail is about the easiest thing there is on the face of the planet.
[00:04:00.798 --> 00:04:03.459]  You find quail, and you got a shotgun.
[00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.000]  Only a complete moron couldn't shoot him.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.341]  It's a ground bird.
[00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:10.562]  I've shot giant stacks of them.
[00:04:11.282 --> 00:04:12.263]  I've never missed.
[00:04:13.877 --> 00:04:14.818]  I'm just tired of it!
[00:04:14.858 --> 00:04:16.339]  I can't handle it anymore!
[00:04:18.681 --> 00:04:20.162]  Alright, I'm gonna go over this.
[00:04:21.282 --> 00:04:28.488]  It's kind of a petty thing, but at the same time it's very important because it just shows how this is total theater.
[00:04:28.528 --> 00:04:29.188]  I'm sick of it!
[00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:33.171]  The whole world's a stage and each man a player, I guess.
[00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:36.834]  I haven't even gotten to the news yet.
[00:04:36.914 --> 00:04:39.295]  It's all very, very important.
[00:04:40.756 --> 00:04:42.077]  And we'll get to it when we get back.
[00:04:42.217 --> 00:04:42.858]  Here's one of them.
[00:04:43.993 --> 00:04:48.095]  I mean, this has been out for years, but here's WorldNetDaily putting a spin on it.
[00:04:48.535 --> 00:04:57.159]  Immigration inspectors under the gun at airports ordered to clear planes of passengers in under an hour despite terror threats.
[00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:59.720]  If you're an illegal alien, you get in.
[00:05:01.058 --> 00:05:03.882]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[00:05:04.002 --> 00:05:04.823]  Michael Trudeau here.
[00:05:04.983 --> 00:05:08.287]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[00:05:08.467 --> 00:05:14.134]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[00:05:14.274 --> 00:05:17.298]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[00:05:17.538 --> 00:05:21.824]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[00:05:22.024 --> 00:05:23.927]  The chronic, everyday pain was miserable.
[00:05:24.047 --> 00:05:31.116]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[00:05:31.297 --> 00:05:33.760]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.743]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice.
[00:05:36.883 --> 00:05:38.384]  Only this time it changed my life.
[00:05:38.664 --> 00:05:40.426]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement.
[00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:42.628]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[00:05:42.788 --> 00:05:45.250]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.992]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[00:05:48.192 --> 00:05:48.713]  Side effects?
[00:05:48.893 --> 00:05:51.155]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now too.
[00:05:51.315 --> 00:05:52.616]  Call Kliscott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[00:05:52.636 --> 00:05:52.856]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[00:05:52.876 --> 00:05:53.817]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[00:05:53.837 --> 00:05:54.598]  It worked for me.
[00:06:00.971 --> 00:06:04.234]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:04.294 --> 00:06:08.457]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:08.717 --> 00:06:11.519]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.101]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:14.302 --> 00:06:22.948]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:23.128 --> 00:06:24.490]  The Brookie Light is different.
[00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.913]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:06:29.147 --> 00:06:30.868]  of the self-sterilizing filters.
[00:06:31.128 --> 00:06:43.072]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[00:06:43.252 --> 00:06:49.835]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:53.196]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.620]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.824]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:07:05.004 --> 00:07:09.428]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:09.588 --> 00:07:13.972]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:07:14.012 --> 00:07:15.354]  The New World Order.
[00:07:16.275 --> 00:07:17.917]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:30.874 --> 00:07:41.202]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:07:41.483 --> 00:07:46.827]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:07:47.367 --> 00:07:50.870]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:51.370]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:51.431 --> 00:07:52.411]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:08:01.252 --> 00:08:06.936]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.537 --> 00:08:10.578]  All right, my friends.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:27.129]  It is Monday, the fifth day of January in 04, and we do have a doctor, the head of a bioethics group, coming on to expose the legalization of human cloning
[00:08:27.788 --> 00:08:33.833]  Going on right now in New Jersey, the industrialization of using body parts.
[00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:38.816]  Growing humans like so much eggplant or potatoes.
[00:08:40.778 --> 00:08:43.019]  Picking us off the vines like grapes.
[00:08:44.921 --> 00:08:47.103]  Destroying the very soul of humanity.
[00:08:47.643 --> 00:08:51.706]  I guess if we're going to have 50 million abortions, I guess they're going to just go ahead and do this as well.
[00:08:52.507 --> 00:08:53.848]  So that's coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:08:55.438 --> 00:09:02.701]  Let me just spend a few minutes on this, then I'll get to the fact that if you're an illegal alien or a foreigner, they have the process of acing you.
[00:09:02.721 --> 00:09:05.502]  This was in the Miami Herald two years ago.
[00:09:05.522 --> 00:09:16.746]  A customs agent, a senior one, Mr. Gonzalez, quit over it and wrote a big editorial for the newspaper.
[00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:20.488]  He said that when the people come off the planes from Middle Eastern countries,
[00:09:21.714 --> 00:09:24.015]  And they've been told to have less restrictions on them.
[00:09:24.055 --> 00:09:25.336]  By the way, this is the Miami Herald.
[00:09:26.737 --> 00:09:31.139]  That when they come off the plane, they are ordered to what they call ace them.
[00:09:31.179 --> 00:09:33.940]  They just hold up their paperwork and walk past.
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.501]  They're not allowed to look at it.
[00:09:37.121 --> 00:09:39.082]  And this is still going on.
[00:09:39.122 --> 00:09:41.603]  There's an article today out of World Net Daily about it.
[00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:42.964]  I want to get into that.
[00:09:43.084 --> 00:09:47.246]  Also, Forex dollar hits record low versus Euro.
[00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:53.056]  And the gold continues to explode, as well as silver.
[00:09:54.417 --> 00:09:57.317]  Father of the Euro calls for global currency.
[00:09:58.098 --> 00:10:00.098]  They're moving forward with their global currency.
[00:10:00.178 --> 00:10:04.839]  And again, you tell the average person this, they'll say, hey, Rush Limbaugh said it doesn't exist.
[00:10:05.199 --> 00:10:06.340]  There is no new world order.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.340]  You're a kook if you say it.
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.821]  OK, this is EU Observer and Reuters.
[00:10:12.388 --> 00:10:15.990]  I just read out of the Associated Press and Reuters and I read the bills here on air.
[00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.051]  Nothing's a conspiracy on this show.
[00:10:18.391 --> 00:10:19.291]  It's all documented.
[00:10:20.852 --> 00:10:24.873]  But this weekend I spent a few hours looking at websites that attack myself and others.
[00:10:25.854 --> 00:10:29.195]  And they'll say stuff like, these lunatics believe there's a world government.
[00:10:29.415 --> 00:10:31.576]  They believe there's a plan for a world tax.
[00:10:31.977 --> 00:10:34.938]  They think some group called the CFR runs things.
[00:10:35.758 --> 00:10:37.499]  Well, the CFR says they do.
[00:10:39.997 --> 00:10:48.702]  And they've got the heads of all the major universities, Congress, that's the House and the Senate, all the big leaders, every president you can imagine.
[00:10:49.122 --> 00:10:52.784]  I mean, all we're doing here is covering what's happening.
[00:10:53.585 --> 00:10:59.388]  But the globalists know that you like to procrastinate and make excuses and don't want to face painful facts.
[00:11:00.222 --> 00:11:05.826]  And so you make excuses, and so it's easy for them to just convince you that government never did anything wrong.
[00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:06.946]  It's all loving.
[00:11:06.966 --> 00:11:08.127]  Give all your rights up.
[00:11:08.427 --> 00:11:10.869]  Anybody that says don't trust government is a weirdo.
[00:11:14.011 --> 00:11:15.552]  So I guess the founding fathers were bad.
[00:11:16.953 --> 00:11:26.939]  Also, Israel's member of parliament proposes ethnic cleansing, and folks, he actually said on state-run radio, ethnic cleansing.
[00:11:28.306 --> 00:11:31.527]  Now, look, they have ethnic cleansing in Saudi Arabia.
[00:11:31.867 --> 00:11:34.328]  That is, if you're not a Muslim, they'll kill you.
[00:11:34.748 --> 00:11:38.489]  If you come outside your armored compound and wearing a cross, they'll kill you.
[00:11:38.869 --> 00:11:40.210]  I don't like Saudi Arabia.
[00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:47.812]  And I don't like Israel saying they want to, some of them saying they want to ethnic cleanse people.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.830]  I'm against Nazis ethnically cleansing human beings, and I'm against, uh, some people...
[00:12:26.715 --> 00:12:30.538]  Wake up, boys, there's a light at the window.
[00:12:30.558 --> 00:12:35.763]  I can hear someone knocking on the door.
[00:12:37.664 --> 00:12:42.308]  There are voices in the street and the sound of running feet.
[00:12:43.089 --> 00:12:46.051]  And they whisper the word, revolution.
[00:12:48.313 --> 00:12:52.377]  There are men coming down from the valleys.
[00:12:54.130 --> 00:13:08.998]  There are tall ships flying off the coast And they carry the light in the dark of the night Like a whisper in the wind Revolution!
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:20.945]  Bring my gun and a handful of silver By the sea we will gather for the fight
[00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:38.870]  It's been so many years So many tears We have lost once before Now we'll settle the score When our cannons will roar Revolution!
[00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:02.039]  And wait, get ready for the sign.
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.945]  There are many here among us now who have not seen the light.
[00:14:06.426 --> 00:14:09.991]  We must say the word to all the people in the land.
[00:14:10.431 --> 00:14:14.277]  Go to every hill and mountain for the time is now at hand.
[00:14:32.128 --> 00:14:33.229]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:36.110]  No government conspiracy.
[00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:44.955]  My connection from Austin, Texas to the satellite uplinks and folks running the show in Minnesota has been... breaks up a couple times a year and that's happening today.
[00:14:46.336 --> 00:14:48.317]  Trying to recap what I was starting to say.
[00:14:50.518 --> 00:14:53.320]  Israeli member of parliament proposes ethnic cleansing.
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.462]  And we'll be getting into that article.
[00:14:57.142 --> 00:15:00.804]  Also, tolerate death threats from the academic left.
[00:15:01.468 --> 00:15:18.625]  And this is out of FrontPageMag, a local conservative group in the high school simply called for reaffirming the Bible, controlling the borders, basic conservative platform, and they got death threats, and the teachers said, so what?
[00:15:18.965 --> 00:15:24.291]  It's basically what you deserve, saying that you want to control the borders.
[00:15:25.512 --> 00:15:27.073]  So I'm going to go over that article.
[00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:29.874]  We're also going to get the folks involved in this on the show.
[00:15:30.534 --> 00:15:34.516]  Blair is saying that Iraq War was a test case.
[00:15:36.297 --> 00:15:41.839]  That it's a test case for any other country that doesn't submit to globalism immediately.
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:52.084]  And of course later we're going to be discussing the situation with cloning being legalized in New Jersey.
[00:15:53.129 --> 00:16:00.353]  But in the first segment, I mentioned the whole world being a stage and each of us being players upon it.
[00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:09.637]  That's paraphrasing what, of course, one of the famous members of British literature had to say.
[00:16:10.637 --> 00:16:17.581]  And all this weekend on talk radio, I watched a little bit of television as well.
[00:16:19.986 --> 00:16:23.188]  Reading the different newspapers, looking at Time Magazine online.
[00:16:23.888 --> 00:16:29.132]  They're telling us that Bush is this incredible outdoorsman, this amazing Texan.
[00:16:29.172 --> 00:16:30.813]  He's like John Wayne.
[00:16:31.193 --> 00:16:32.654]  We should all trust him.
[00:16:32.674 --> 00:16:39.578]  You know, the image of the guy in the cowboy hat out on the range is one of trust.
[00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:58.478]  They're feeding on that image of the gunslinger or the image of John Wayne out there in the plains of Texas or in Arizona fighting the heathen masses.
[00:17:00.319 --> 00:17:06.341]  And this is admittedly a carefully crafted front that the White House is putting on.
[00:17:06.361 --> 00:17:08.182]  I mean, they bought this ranch
[00:17:09.673 --> 00:17:17.835]  This patch of scrub brush just north of Austin, two years before Bush was elected, they built a house on it.
[00:17:18.775 --> 00:17:20.155]  There's no horses there.
[00:17:20.195 --> 00:17:29.497]  When Vicente Fox showed up last year and wanted to ride horses with Bush, because he's got a real ranch, they said, oh, we don't have any horses here.
[00:17:30.477 --> 00:17:33.117]  And Bush likes to ride around in his pickup truck.
[00:17:33.397 --> 00:17:36.558]  He's really trying to imitate what LBJ did.
[00:17:37.236 --> 00:17:43.460]  You know, LBJ really had a ranch in between Fredericksburg and Austin, out in Johnson City.
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.180]  It's still there.
[00:17:45.501 --> 00:17:48.803]  And he would drive around in his car at 60, 70 miles an hour.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:29.660]  Late summer 2003.
[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:34.141]  Mainstream press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[00:18:34.541 --> 00:18:35.062]  Late summer 2002?
[00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:37.282]  I heard the same thing.
[00:18:37.722 --> 00:18:39.163]  Late summer 2001?
[00:18:39.503 --> 00:18:40.603]  You heard the same thing.
[00:18:40.983 --> 00:18:48.125]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently trading in a 93 to 9400 range, is down 7% from two years ago.
[00:18:48.625 --> 00:18:49.525]  That's recovery?
[00:18:50.126 --> 00:18:52.246]  Gold, now trading in the $360 range, is up 31% in that same period.
[00:18:55.728 --> 00:18:57.308]  Where do you want your hard-earned money?
[00:18:57.968 --> 00:19:00.729]  Hi folks, this is Jack Brown with Midas Resources.

[00:19:26.823 --> 00:19:29.024]  Hey, John Statman here, and I have a question for you.
[00:19:29.244 --> 00:19:30.765]  Are you having an energy crisis?
[00:19:31.105 --> 00:19:33.747]  No, I'm not talking about the rising cost of gasoline.
[00:19:33.987 --> 00:19:35.868]  I'm talking about you, personally.
[00:19:36.148 --> 00:19:39.110]  Do you have the energy you need to do all the things in life that you need to do?
[00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:41.191]  If you're like most people, the answer is no.
[00:19:41.531 --> 00:19:45.273]  And that extra cup of coffee or an afternoon candy bar is not the solution.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.501]  There's a safe and effective way to energize your life naturally.
[00:19:48.781 --> 00:19:50.802]  It's called Be Alive Royal Jelly.

[00:20:56.315 --> 00:21:03.160]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.

[00:22:34.811 --> 00:22:35.852]  You don't have to pay them off.
[00:22:36.092 --> 00:22:37.513]  The banks are defrauding you.
[00:22:37.793 --> 00:22:39.254]  Now is the time to fight back.

[00:23:35.796 --> 00:23:37.277]  This show is documented.
[00:23:37.811 --> 00:23:40.592]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:23:40.972 --> 00:23:44.534]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:23:44.934 --> 00:23:49.096]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:23:49.556 --> 00:23:53.778]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[00:23:53.798 --> 00:23:55.238]  The ring of fire.
[00:23:55.298 --> 00:23:56.159]  Alright, folks.
[00:23:57.179 --> 00:24:02.021]  Alex Jones here, trying to do a show.
[00:24:03.402 --> 00:24:03.642]  Look.
[00:24:04.884 --> 00:24:14.492]  I've already gone over this, but you know about Bush and the Made in the USA spray-painted on the boxes with the Made in China covered up, which by the way is a felony.
[00:24:14.912 --> 00:24:22.298]  To have stuff in a warehouse and put false country of origin markings on something is a serious felony.
[00:24:22.958 --> 00:24:23.839]  That was reported on.
[00:24:24.259 --> 00:24:27.642]  But that's what the White House is doing, creating the illusion of Made in America.
[00:24:28.522 --> 00:24:32.926]  In New Jersey, they did some similar things and got caught.
[00:24:33.607 --> 00:24:34.707]  Uh, in Indiana.
[00:24:35.508 --> 00:24:37.228]  That made everybody take their ties off.
[00:24:37.268 --> 00:24:40.530]  When some refused, the Secret Service threatened to throw them out.
[00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:50.173]  Because the White House, um, Karl Rove, the head minion, the White House Chief of Staff, quote, didn't want the image of a bunch of white-collar people.
[00:24:51.333 --> 00:24:59.576]  The example here is, the point here is, is that that's how much they're micromanaging things.
[00:25:00.757 --> 00:25:01.777]  That's the level
[00:25:02.478 --> 00:25:04.639]  That they're controlling things.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.100]  Okay?
[00:25:07.221 --> 00:25:15.305]  And when you have Bush out at the ranch, it is admittedly a stage with hay bales and tractors and everything.
[00:25:16.146 --> 00:25:23.390]  And I was so shocked over the weekend to hear all these different talk show hosts going, oh, he's such a great quail hunter, the first hunter.
[00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:25.751]  Oh, he's such a good shot.
[00:25:26.311 --> 00:25:29.613]  Oh, he loves working on the ranch and cutting down brush.
[00:25:29.934 --> 00:25:30.674]  He's tough.
[00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:43.999]  And it was just so comical, because I know, living in Texas, that most people around the country think we ride around on horses, and that there's tumbleweeds blowing by, and, oh, Texans are so neat and so tough.
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:51.985]  And so Bush is just glomming on to what LBJ did out at his ranch in Johnson City.
[00:25:53.827 --> 00:25:58.810]  And he's creating this illusion of this good old country boy that you can trust.
[00:25:59.991 --> 00:26:00.772]  And look, I have no
[00:26:01.613 --> 00:26:10.536]  Nothing against you if you're from Kennebunkport, Maine, and your family goes back to the Tories in 1776 on the side of the British.
[00:26:11.876 --> 00:26:28.222]  I have nothing against you, but they're bluebloods that go back to England, back to landed nobility, back to the very royal family, according to Reuters, that is in power in the United Kingdom right now.
[00:26:29.159 --> 00:26:32.600]  So, the Bushes really aren't even Americans, folks.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:39.742]  In 1832, they were part of the founding of Skull and Bones, which was done with German money.
[00:26:40.522 --> 00:26:43.083]  Admittedly, to overthrow the United States.
[00:26:43.143 --> 00:26:50.625]  That's why the Lucius Trust, through the Russell Trust, did what it did.
[00:26:51.065 --> 00:26:55.126]  Because John Quincy Adams had gone after, quote, the Illuminati.
[00:26:55.366 --> 00:26:57.667]  That's our president writing books and letters.
[00:27:03.208 --> 00:27:07.352]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:27:08.032 --> 00:27:08.833]  You want answers?
[00:27:09.634 --> 00:27:10.495]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:10.515 --> 00:27:14.839]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:15.359 --> 00:27:19.463]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:21.785 --> 00:27:27.791]  Monday through Friday, from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight on here live, it is 2004.
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:36.301]  We've already gone to a lot of callers in the first hour, but none of you have commented on what I'd like you to comment on.
[00:27:36.321 --> 00:27:47.463]  You can talk about whatever you want, but I'd like to hear your big predictions for the economy, for terror attacks, for the open borders, for the assault weapons ban, all that coming up this year.
[00:27:47.483 --> 00:27:52.964]  In 04, I'd like to hear you talk about what you think the big three stories of 03 were.
[00:27:55.305 --> 00:27:56.145]  I'd like to, uh,
[00:27:57.168 --> 00:27:59.509]  Here are your predictions for what's going to happen in Iraq.
[00:27:59.909 --> 00:28:08.752]  Are we going to go into Syria and Iran, as Richard Perle, known as the Prince of Darkness, and that's really his nickname at the Defense Department, is calling for.
[00:28:09.352 --> 00:28:10.573]  What do you think about these issues?
[00:28:10.653 --> 00:28:16.675]  Also, more on the Matrix System, more on the Second Amendment, a bunch of news that I mentioned first.
[00:28:16.915 --> 00:28:19.916]  We'll be getting to that here pretty quick, but I want to go right back to your calls.
[00:28:20.256 --> 00:28:22.857]  It's wide open phones on this show today.
[00:28:23.817 --> 00:28:24.278]  It's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:28:24.318 --> 00:28:29.685]  Getting involved in the first show of the new year here on this January 2nd, 2004 show.
[00:28:35.896 --> 00:28:36.996]  Almost said three show.
[00:28:37.596 --> 00:28:41.757]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are some of the best websites out there.
[00:28:41.777 --> 00:28:43.858]  I hope you'll visit them daily and spread the word.
[00:28:44.318 --> 00:28:47.318]  Christopher in Florida got cut short last hour, so I held him over.
[00:28:48.079 --> 00:28:49.699]  Christopher, you got something in the mail.
[00:28:49.799 --> 00:28:50.599]  I've gotten it, too.
[00:28:50.639 --> 00:28:51.379]  Tell us all about it.
[00:28:51.579 --> 00:28:52.720]  Well, it's an interesting thing.
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:57.621]  I've got another issue or two I wanted to throw at you, too, but a credit card application.
[00:28:57.661 --> 00:28:58.421]  We all get these.
[00:28:58.461 --> 00:29:00.741]  You know, you're pre-approved, etc., etc.
[00:29:01.181 --> 00:29:03.722]  And I picked up a little line at the bottom here.
[00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:05.750]  And I'm going to read it to you.
[00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:16.496]  It says, before completing your application, please see reverse for important information about the USA Patriot Act Customer Identification Program.
[00:29:17.137 --> 00:29:30.585]  And then it continues on the back to say, the USA Patriot Act is a federal law that requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account.
[00:29:31.089 --> 00:29:37.156]  You will be asked to provide your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you.
[00:29:37.697 --> 00:29:41.922]  We may also ask you to provide identifying documentation.
[00:29:41.942 --> 00:29:44.905]  Yeah, and then what happens is, that's a contract.
[00:29:45.466 --> 00:29:48.990]  Everything you do and purchase will be put into the matrix system.
[00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:49.671]  Right.
[00:29:50.413 --> 00:29:54.414]  And by the way, every time I say Matrix, I get emails going, you nut, that's a movie.
[00:29:54.974 --> 00:29:58.375]  No, folks, it's a federal program with the states.
[00:29:59.255 --> 00:30:01.356]  Everything you buy, sell, or do, to be recorded.
[00:30:01.376 --> 00:30:01.776]  Go ahead.
[00:30:01.816 --> 00:30:18.861]  And to segue right into what you're saying there, I had a friend who was having lunch recently near a very large new car dealership, sitting there next to the general manager and the financial officer, the person who does all the
[00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:38.384]  It was a very interesting conversation, and I came back with the following, and I don't know if any of you or any of your listeners know about this, but what was overheard was the following, that apparently they are required, due to the Patriot Act, that anybody who has an appearance that is suspect, i.e.
[00:30:38.705 --> 00:30:45.810]  foreign, male particularly, they are required to enter into some sort of database
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:46.980]  I don't
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:11.902]  And understand, they just say, oh, it's for foreigners if they look suspicious, but then it's for everybody.
[00:31:11.942 --> 00:31:13.563]  It's like searching at the airports.
[00:31:13.983 --> 00:31:17.705]  You know, the guys with the turbans go right by, but the white guy or the black guy gets searched.
[00:31:17.965 --> 00:31:19.325]  It's really looking for drugs.
[00:31:19.705 --> 00:31:22.827]  It's really an excuse to search and go through everything we're doing.
[00:31:22.867 --> 00:31:28.209]  But it's pawn shops, it's car dealerships, it's bookstores, it's everything.
[00:31:28.829 --> 00:31:31.970]  Everything you do, everything you buy, cracked and frayed.
[00:31:32.757 --> 00:31:33.498]  Absolutely correct.
[00:31:33.578 --> 00:31:45.868]  And one of the other problems is that people who are full-fledged American citizens, naturalized citizens, whose appearance may be foreign and they're quite American, are going to be subjected to additional harassment.
[00:31:45.888 --> 00:31:49.792]  That's just what they tell these car dealer guys when they're implementing it.
[00:31:49.912 --> 00:31:50.732]  Oh, it's for them.
[00:31:50.792 --> 00:31:52.454]  It's only for the Jews.
[00:31:52.874 --> 00:31:54.436]  It's only for the gypsies.
[00:31:54.636 --> 00:31:55.977]  It's not for the Reich folk.
[00:31:56.637 --> 00:31:56.978]  Stay there.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.883]  I have been on Collagenate for three months now and I've lost 40 pounds.
[00:32:02.363 --> 00:32:03.824]  40 pounds in three months?
[00:32:04.284 --> 00:32:09.828]  Ann's another listener who took my advice and lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:32:10.108 --> 00:32:12.330]  I heard about Collagenate through a radio station.
[00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:14.732]  I've gone down about three dress sizes.
[00:32:14.932 --> 00:32:15.432]  I feel good.
[00:32:15.452 --> 00:32:16.093]  I have energy.
[00:32:16.273 --> 00:32:17.334]  I was really tired before.
[00:32:17.374 --> 00:32:18.194]  I didn't have a lot of energy.
[00:32:18.214 --> 00:32:20.256]  And I've got three kids, so it was kind of hard to keep up with them.
[00:32:20.416 --> 00:32:21.497]  But now I feel wonderful.
[00:32:21.657 --> 00:32:23.058]  I've had people notice quite a bit.
[00:32:23.118 --> 00:32:24.839]  They're coming up to me and they're saying, what have you done?
[00:32:24.899 --> 00:32:26.280]  And I just tell them I went on Collagenate.
[00:32:26.721 --> 00:32:30.223]  I have been on Collagenate for three months now and I've lost 40 pounds.
[00:32:30.483 --> 00:32:30.804]  Wow!
[00:32:31.484 --> 00:32:32.084]  40 pounds!
[00:32:32.485 --> 00:32:36.287]  This was Anne's personal experience while taking Vim and Vigor's Collagenate.
[00:32:36.467 --> 00:32:38.788]  Why don't you see what Collagenate can do for you?
[00:32:39.069 --> 00:32:40.549]  Call Vim and Vigor today at 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:32:40.569 --> 00:32:40.790]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:32:46.721 --> 00:32:49.622]  And hey, get $25 off a 3-month supply of Collagen-8.
[00:32:49.743 --> 00:32:50.863]  You gotta call now, 1-800-622-8446.
[00:32:50.883 --> 00:32:51.403]  Again, that's 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:02.932]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:33:03.272 --> 00:33:07.354]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:33:07.654 --> 00:33:08.214]  We listened.
[00:33:08.514 --> 00:33:13.497]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:33:13.777 --> 00:33:14.257]  We listened.
[00:33:14.637 --> 00:33:17.698]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:33:18.099 --> 00:33:18.639]  We listened.
[00:33:19.099 --> 00:33:23.160]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:24.020]  We listened.
[00:33:24.381 --> 00:33:29.602]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:33:30.022 --> 00:33:31.382]  Again, we listened.
[00:33:31.743 --> 00:33:39.125]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:33:39.505 --> 00:33:42.546]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259.99.

[00:33:53.492 --> 00:33:54.893]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:33:57.555 --> 00:34:00.437]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[00:34:01.158 --> 00:34:02.459]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:34:02.659 --> 00:34:08.403]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:34:08.684 --> 00:34:13.927]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:34:14.228 --> 00:34:18.371]  Brace yourselves, as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:34:18.551 --> 00:34:22.353]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:34:22.594 --> 00:34:27.237]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:34:27.317 --> 00:34:30.059]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[00:34:30.379 --> 00:34:33.542]  Psychotic UN Population Control Plans and much, much more.
[00:34:33.602 --> 00:34:35.464]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:34:35.924 --> 00:34:38.006]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny today.

[00:34:49.736 --> 00:34:51.737]  You see Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[00:34:51.978 --> 00:34:53.499]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:55.701]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:35:03.325 --> 00:35:07.508]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:35:08.149 --> 00:35:08.969]  You want answers?
[00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:10.630]  Well, so does he.
[00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:14.953]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:15.494 --> 00:35:19.597]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:35:21.518 --> 00:35:29.484]  Folks, the same thing that happened in Nazi Germany, the same thing that happened in Soviet Russia, is now being set up here.
[00:35:31.215 --> 00:35:34.056]  In Russia, they said, oh, it's just those rich people.
[00:35:34.457 --> 00:35:36.818]  We're just going to kill them and take their wealth.
[00:35:37.938 --> 00:35:39.119]  It's like the French Revolution.
[00:35:39.219 --> 00:35:40.700]  Oh, we're just going to get the royalty.
[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:52.085]  Then it turned into anybody who was even in the lower middle class, packs of criminals in government outfits, police outfits, running around raping and killing and slaughtering.
[00:35:52.465 --> 00:35:53.486]  Same thing in Russia.
[00:35:53.546 --> 00:35:55.027]  Same thing in Nazi Germany.
[00:35:55.047 --> 00:35:59.709]  I mean, there are thousands of cases where the SS local captain wants your wife.
[00:36:00.519 --> 00:36:04.102]  Or, you know, he owns a business and you're the restaurant across the street.
[00:36:04.462 --> 00:36:05.784]  Well, they just have you arrested.
[00:36:07.005 --> 00:36:10.047]  And you're a nice, you know, blond-haired, blue-eyed German.
[00:36:11.528 --> 00:36:14.311]  You're just a poor farmer who owns five acres.
[00:36:15.111 --> 00:36:20.896]  Well, they round you up and put you in a forced labor camp and then no food gets produced and you starve to death.
[00:36:22.257 --> 00:36:24.499]  And let me tell you, this whole control grid
[00:36:25.214 --> 00:36:30.899]  See, here it's not, oh, we're going to get the rich guys, or oh, we're going to get the Jews, or oh, we're going to get the, you know, whatever group isn't liked.
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.042]  It's always, oh, we're doing all this to get them.
[00:36:34.062 --> 00:36:36.705]  And, you know, that's bad enough.
[00:36:37.165 --> 00:36:42.951]  And then the poor fools go, oh, well, get them rich guys, or get them Jews, or now it's get them Arabs.
[00:36:43.371 --> 00:36:45.853]  Get them guys with them turbans on.
[00:36:46.334 --> 00:36:47.295]  Get them idiots.
[00:36:47.835 --> 00:36:50.077]  Come on, you're in deep trouble now, boy!
[00:36:51.676 --> 00:36:53.317]  But it's not for them.
[00:36:54.117 --> 00:36:55.738]  Certainly they're going to get chewed up first.
[00:36:56.679 --> 00:36:58.199]  No, it's for everybody.
[00:36:58.279 --> 00:37:07.004]  Buying a used car, getting a bank account, getting a credit card, got over $3,000 in cash in the bank, you're a terrorist!
[00:37:08.965 --> 00:37:15.548]  Biometrically being scanned to leave the country, to come into the country unless you're an illegal alien and they accept any fake ID you've got, that's admitted.
[00:37:16.309 --> 00:37:21.934]  It's about a total federalization of local police, of local government, of all businesses.
[00:37:22.215 --> 00:37:24.917]  Type in Patriot Act compliance in a search engine.
[00:37:26.058 --> 00:37:28.080]  Hundreds of thousands of links will pop up.
[00:37:28.441 --> 00:37:39.351]  Every conceivable business, every conceivable activity, everything you do with the bank or the grocery store, any big outfit being uploaded daily to Homeland Security.
[00:37:41.101 --> 00:37:46.464]  Your test scores, what drugs you take, your medical records, everything!
[00:37:48.045 --> 00:37:48.605]  Everything!
[00:37:49.026 --> 00:38:09.678]  What you watch off your digital cable box, that phone line you've got hooked up to your satellite dish, you can quote get the paid-per-view, everything you buy, everything you do, everything you watch, your OnStar system listening to you, every cell phone tracking where you're at, they can listen to you with audio, not just track you, even when the phone's off.
[00:38:11.974 --> 00:38:14.995]  No more Fourth Amendment for any reason.
[00:38:15.536 --> 00:38:18.557]  No more warrants for any reason.
[00:38:18.877 --> 00:38:20.197]  And look at who they're using against.
[00:38:20.278 --> 00:38:26.900]  Topless bars, county commissioners, zoning disputes, Rush Limbaugh to get his medical records using the Patriot Act.
[00:38:28.421 --> 00:38:29.902]  Is Rush Limbaugh a terrorist?
[00:38:31.242 --> 00:38:33.243]  Is the topless bar a terrorist?
[00:38:33.303 --> 00:38:40.006]  Is the county commissioner involved in a good old boy zoning scam a terrorist?
[00:38:40.106 --> 00:38:40.306]  No.
[00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:44.307]  And it's all to be selectively enforced.
[00:38:44.587 --> 00:38:48.629]  RFID from the plant to your home to the landfill tracking you.
[00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:51.490]  More and more crimes.
[00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:53.031]  Send an email to the wrong person.
[00:38:53.071 --> 00:38:53.691]  It's spam.
[00:38:54.011 --> 00:38:55.592]  Five years of life in prison.
[00:38:56.132 --> 00:38:56.993]  New laws.
[00:38:57.133 --> 00:38:58.833]  Hundreds of new federal and state laws.
[00:38:59.334 --> 00:39:02.095]  Every year making everything a serious felony.
[00:39:03.186 --> 00:39:09.050]  Any misdemeanor, an act of terrorism, a suspected misdemeanor, then you have no rights.
[00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:11.131]  I'm sorry, that was under the first Patriot Act.
[00:39:11.151 --> 00:39:12.512]  It's worse under Patriot Act 2.
[00:39:12.772 --> 00:39:14.073]  They don't need anything!
[00:39:15.594 --> 00:39:28.482]  It's so pedal-to-the-metal, it's so dangerous, it's so wild, it's so overt, that you hear the good old boys on radio, round up all them Arabs and put them in camps.
[00:39:28.963 --> 00:39:30.944]  Anybody disagrees with the government,
[00:39:31.778 --> 00:39:33.098]  Put them in a camp!
[00:39:33.398 --> 00:39:38.940]  Oh, there's national hosts saying that every day in every major city, and you know who I'm talking about.
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:59.905]  On the air, saying, put people in camps, and generals talking about martial law being a good thing, and the heads of FEMA saying it, and under a red alert, you're an enemy if you leave your home, and in places like Wisconsin, passing laws that if you sue a public official, you get charged with paper terrorism, and the head of the Judicial Committee
[00:40:00.888 --> 00:40:14.613]  Criminal Committee, Senator Menace in Oregon, anybody blocks traffic, one protester commits any misdemeanor, everyone in the protest gets life in prison in a forced labor camp.
[00:40:15.464 --> 00:40:17.667]  That, by the way, is in Police State 3 and on the website.
[00:40:17.907 --> 00:40:21.551]  Mainstream news out of the Oregonian Associated Press and the bill.
[00:40:21.591 --> 00:40:27.738]  We go line through line, zooming in, right on each line, slowly, so you can read it.
[00:40:28.058 --> 00:40:29.980]  The point is, this is what they want.
[00:40:30.281 --> 00:40:31.302]  This is what they're doing.
[00:40:31.402 --> 00:40:33.504]  I don't care how nuts it sounds!
[00:40:34.225 --> 00:40:43.512]  We're dealing with people that knowingly knew that HIV and Hepatitis was in the blood, coming out of the prisons, and to this day are putting it in the blood supply.
[00:40:43.773 --> 00:40:52.339]  We're dealing with people that'll nerve gas our troops, and do a test, watch them drop dead like cockroaches, and nobody gets in trouble for it.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:41:01.166]  We're dealing with a government, ladies and gentlemen, so evil, that it blows my mind, me to stop being naive.
[00:41:01.186 --> 00:41:02.087]  Is Christopher still there?
[00:41:03.936 --> 00:41:06.437]  Wanted to segue into exactly what you're saying there with our troops.
[00:41:06.517 --> 00:41:10.239]  As a veteran, I can particularly speak to the depleted uranium situation.
[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:19.325]  My heart goes out to everybody over there in Bosnia and everywhere else, you know, as well as I, the effects of that so-called depleted product.
[00:41:19.345 --> 00:41:27.449]  4.5 billion year half-life and, you know, the horrible birth defects and cancer and such.
[00:41:27.849 --> 00:41:30.771]  And we're going to just see a whole new wave of problems.
[00:41:31.131 --> 00:41:32.812]  And let's give folks the official numbers.
[00:41:33.487 --> 00:41:41.734]  If you're a Gulf War Vet 1, you have three times the chances of having deformed children, and they find in the tissues the depleted uranium.
[00:41:42.054 --> 00:41:46.518]  The Army's own top scientist resigned, said it's true, it's killing them, I won't be part of this.
[00:41:46.558 --> 00:41:52.983]  Now, they used ten times as much in this war, and they used it in all the big cities before they weren't allowed to.
[00:41:53.837 --> 00:41:56.884]  Okay, same numbers coming out of Serbia, where they used it.
[00:41:57.144 --> 00:42:03.799]  Now it's ten times higher in the areas, the big bases where our troops are staying, in the palaces, in the military bases.
[00:42:04.998 --> 00:42:12.040]  In the main streets, and if it's triple with ten times less, what's it going to be now this time?
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:13.260]  And that's a fact.
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:13.980]  Let me say it again.
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:18.421]  That is a fact, fact, fact, fact, fact.
[00:42:18.461 --> 00:42:22.242]  Now, how do we support the troops by not standing up against this?
[00:42:22.282 --> 00:42:22.662]  Go ahead.
[00:42:22.942 --> 00:42:25.483]  Why would the globalists do something like that, Christopher?
[00:42:26.083 --> 00:42:34.185]  Well, you know, of course, it's all about getting us conditioned to accept, you know, authoritarian rule here in this country, and to understand that
[00:42:35.031 --> 00:42:38.532]  We don't have any individual rights, and that's what it comes down to.
[00:42:38.652 --> 00:42:43.214]  We're losing our rights on a daily basis.
[00:42:43.494 --> 00:42:53.558]  Our government has used our citizens as guinea pigs for so many years, and you know that as well as I do, through many CIA experiments, et cetera, gases released in cities.
[00:42:53.638 --> 00:42:54.339]  It's nothing new.
[00:42:54.939 --> 00:42:58.040]  And this is just a particularly horrendous example.
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:01.702]  This is unbelievable, effectively nuclear war.
[00:43:01.722 --> 00:43:03.502]  But what does it say about their mindset?
[00:43:03.522 --> 00:43:04.703]  They know it's deadly.
[00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:07.931]  It's the stuff from nuclear weapons production plants.
[00:43:09.031 --> 00:43:16.153]  It's stuff, you know, I mean, it's much worse than grinding up the uranium in a chest x-ray and snorting it.
[00:43:16.693 --> 00:43:19.514]  It reminds me of, you know, Damien the Omen.
[00:43:19.754 --> 00:43:20.434]  That mindset.
[00:43:21.835 --> 00:43:23.215]  Quite frankly, if you want to know.
[00:43:23.795 --> 00:43:27.436]  And then it just so happens that they really are in skull and bones.
[00:43:27.696 --> 00:43:29.397]  They really do go to Bohemian Grove.
[00:43:30.237 --> 00:43:32.598]  They really do flash all their occult symbols.
[00:43:32.798 --> 00:43:33.958]  They really are into that.
[00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:36.280]  I want to finish up here, Alex.
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:44.962]  I want to let you know that I just placed an order for every single one of your documentaries, your book, as well as Paul Joseph Blatt's book as well.
[00:43:44.982 --> 00:43:50.803]  I look forward to receiving those soon and sharing those with a bunch of other people.
[00:43:50.963 --> 00:43:53.443]  You asked, will somebody please attack the big picture?
[00:43:53.483 --> 00:43:54.664]  Where are we going and everything?
[00:43:55.564 --> 00:44:02.445]  Your previous caller, I think, hit the real core issue there, and that's the Federal Reserve.
[00:44:03.069 --> 00:44:11.731]  Where would this country be if we didn't have a bunch of elite people printing our money for us, charging us face value plus interest for the money?
[00:44:11.771 --> 00:44:15.932]  Where would this country be if we had an actual, real, honest money?
[00:44:16.412 --> 00:44:24.593]  And then we would possibly be in the situation we are in today where we have a bunch of megalomaniacs who are exploiting every last resource in the world.
[00:44:25.173 --> 00:44:28.034]  As you said, we have a great deal of resources in Alaska.
[00:44:28.615 --> 00:44:30.857]  But they're probably not going to let us have that.
[00:44:30.877 --> 00:44:46.911]  Instead, they're going to manufacture crisis after crisis and form the control grid that you're discussing and herd us up like cattle and get us under control and make us happy about it.
[00:44:48.332 --> 00:44:48.793]  I hear you.
[00:44:48.813 --> 00:44:49.413]  Thanks for the call.
[00:44:49.473 --> 00:44:50.054]  Great call.
[00:44:50.494 --> 00:44:53.917]  Let's talk now to Roger in Pennsylvania.
[00:44:53.957 --> 00:44:54.518]  Go ahead, Roger.
[00:44:55.023 --> 00:44:55.804]  Yeah, thanks Alex.
[00:44:56.064 --> 00:45:14.556]  When you had Rabbi Spivak, because you guys kind of all discussed this highly unlikely, but not impossible situation of a bomb in a box with a combination lock, and pretty much all agreed that there you're in that instant combat situation.
[00:45:14.596 --> 00:45:17.258]  Yeah, you'd probably idly release the number, but
[00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:21.934]  You really didn't discuss, really, these real-world torture scenarios.
[00:45:21.954 --> 00:45:27.799]  Well, the point is, you don't institutionalize it, and it's admitted in Iraq that they're torturing the daylights out of these people.
[00:45:28.199 --> 00:45:40.070]  Yeah, so you need to get them back to discuss these real-world scenarios that are going on right now, like in Kuba and other actions that, like, probably our own troops are placed in the positions over in Iraq.
[00:45:40.615 --> 00:45:42.556]  So, uh, yeah, bring him back on that.
[00:45:42.636 --> 00:45:46.139]  Now that should be interesting to actually draw him out on those scenarios.
[00:45:46.419 --> 00:45:53.744]  I mean, you got a room of 20 guys and you think that two or three of them are likely to cough up information that could save American lives.
[00:45:53.804 --> 00:45:56.366]  Then can you torture them, Rabbi Spivak?
[00:45:57.486 --> 00:45:58.167]  And God bless Alex.
[00:45:58.667 --> 00:45:59.408]  Okay, thanks.
[00:45:59.588 --> 00:46:03.891]  You know, it's an important discussion, but I'm not going to censor people.
[00:46:03.951 --> 00:46:07.093]  I just don't want to keep this squabbling going any further.
[00:46:07.153 --> 00:46:10.395]  I mean, it's a stupid mindset, but
[00:46:10.913 --> 00:46:13.275]  It's being sold to us, and it's dangerous.
[00:46:14.276 --> 00:46:15.837]  And, uh, I know this.
[00:46:15.957 --> 00:46:21.242]  I mean, for a hundred calls that are against torture, I get one person that's for it.
[00:46:21.442 --> 00:46:27.107]  And the problem is, is that the TV network shows are all pushing torture.
[00:46:27.187 --> 00:46:29.109]  It's the new chic thing.
[00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:31.751]  And that should concern every single one of us.
[00:46:31.791 --> 00:46:33.393]  And it's being institutionalized.
[00:46:34.274 --> 00:46:38.077]  The question is, should we have Fort Benning, Georgia, that taught the world how to torture?
[00:46:39.295 --> 00:46:45.082]  Could we have protected Klaus Barbie and Joseph Mingala and others that helped set up our CIA?
[00:46:45.783 --> 00:46:47.044]  Our government's answer is yes.
[00:46:47.124 --> 00:46:49.467]  Well, I stand against Klaus Barbie.
[00:46:50.368 --> 00:46:51.749]  I stand against Joseph Mingala.
[00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:53.672]  If that means I'm a Nazi, so be it.
[00:46:54.272 --> 00:46:55.954]  I'm against Nazis, so I'm a Nazi.
[00:46:55.974 --> 00:46:56.575]  We'll be right back.
[00:46:58.328 --> 00:46:59.289]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:46:59.369 --> 00:47:04.153]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:47:04.313 --> 00:47:12.140]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:17.765]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:47:17.985 --> 00:47:24.951]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:47:25.251 --> 00:47:30.575]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:47:30.835 --> 00:47:35.578]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:47:35.919 --> 00:47:43.524]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:47:43.864 --> 00:47:50.108]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:47:50.429 --> 00:47:51.549]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:47:54.281 --> 00:47:55.182]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:47:56.863 --> 00:47:59.844]  Some people know all about drinking and driving.
[00:48:00.925 --> 00:48:13.312]  I, uh, would often leave a bar and, uh, I remember going out to the car and I remember then winding up in bed at home, but I don't remember any of the middle, how I got there.
[00:48:14.213 --> 00:48:22.878]  I know that at certain times I would simply use the center line as an aiming device with the ornament on the hood.
[00:48:23.766 --> 00:48:28.789]  Some people don't decide how they're going to get home until they're incapable of making a responsible decision.
[00:48:28.809 --> 00:48:30.009]  Are you one of them?
[00:48:53.888 --> 00:48:56.849]  Brought to you by Matt, Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
[00:48:57.009 --> 00:49:04.552]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:49:04.812 --> 00:49:17.797]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[00:49:18.077 --> 00:49:21.378]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:49:21.718 --> 00:49:32.182]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:49:32.482 --> 00:49:32.982]  That's right!
[00:49:33.162 --> 00:49:40.285]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:49:40.565 --> 00:49:44.686]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[00:49:44.846 --> 00:49:49.088]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at
[00:49:50.408 --> 00:49:50.749]  I think so.
[00:49:59.628 --> 00:50:05.091]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:50:05.532 --> 00:50:09.754]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:50:09.994 --> 00:50:17.038]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:50:17.419 --> 00:50:23.522]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:50:23.662 --> 00:50:24.863]  There are no side effects.
[00:50:25.223 --> 00:50:28.166]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:50:28.326 --> 00:50:30.348]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:50:30.649 --> 00:50:37.916]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:50:38.196 --> 00:50:41.660]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:45.804]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free at 866-885-8000.
[00:50:47.329 --> 00:50:47.389]  6625-866-885-6625.
[00:50:47.429 --> 00:50:48.530]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:49.051]  Call today.
[00:50:49.091 --> 00:50:50.252]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:50:50.272 --> 00:50:52.334]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:16.195 --> 00:51:20.640]  All right my friends we're now back in real time.
[00:51:21.721 --> 00:51:23.743]  It is the fifth day of January 2004.
[00:51:24.284 --> 00:51:31.811]  Again I have my studio in South Austin having some technical connection problems up to Minnesota and the satellite uplinks and the folks around the show.
[00:51:32.212 --> 00:51:35.255]  So I've now driven over to John Stattmiller's studio and I'm doing this
[00:51:36.057 --> 00:51:37.377]  From his outfit.
[00:51:37.818 --> 00:51:44.299]  Again, this happens once or twice a year, and it's the good, the bad, and the uglies of technology.
[00:51:44.499 --> 00:51:49.220]  We're going to cover the news now, and we're going to take your calls today here on the show.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.721]  The toll-free number to join us on-air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:51:56.701 --> 00:52:06.889]  Immigration inspectors under the gun at airports ordered to clear planes of passengers in under one hour despite terror threats.
[00:52:07.589 --> 00:52:07.829]  U.S.
[00:52:07.869 --> 00:52:22.020]  immigration inspectors, who are the first line of defense against foreign terrorists entering the country, are being asked to do more in less time and with less money even as the country remains on high terror alert, several U.S.
[00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:23.461]  officials complained.
[00:52:24.301 --> 00:52:24.982]  Now folks,
[00:52:25.933 --> 00:52:35.637]  The Department of Customs, years ago, right after 9-11, had many of its prominent officers go public.
[00:52:35.937 --> 00:52:44.480]  I remember quite well one out of the Miami Herald, Mr. Gonzales, Frank Gonzales, who was there at the airport.
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:47.801]  He was the head customs official at the big Miami airport.
[00:52:48.223 --> 00:52:49.564]  And he said it's called acing.
[00:52:49.984 --> 00:52:51.585]  And it's gotten worse since 9-11.
[00:52:51.805 --> 00:53:07.276]  We're ordered to allow people deplaning from foreign countries, including Middle Eastern nations, he says it's even worse for those countries under their orders, to let them walk through and simply hold up their documents and they're not allowed to pull anyone out of the line.
[00:53:07.916 --> 00:53:15.181]  But you as a citizen are going to just go through all these different forms of harassment.
[00:53:15.561 --> 00:53:17.863]  Now how does this jive or connect
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:33.968]  With the fake terror alerts out of France, where it turns out that those were staged, even the governor of Nevada has said that that was false info that caused some of their flights to be shut down and military gunships in the sky.
[00:53:34.368 --> 00:53:42.812]  We know, going back years, that the White House has ordered, quote, fake terror alerts to, quote, create hysteria.
[00:53:44.042 --> 00:53:45.523]  World Net Daily has learned that U.S.
[00:53:45.563 --> 00:53:53.848]  Department of Homeland Security late last month ordered inspectors at the nation's international airports to speed the processing of foreign passengers.
[00:53:54.328 --> 00:53:57.990]  International flights must now be cleared within 60 minutes of arrival.
[00:53:58.470 --> 00:54:07.035]  The new one-hour processing rule applies even under the Code Orange threat level that is expected to remain in effect at least through the end of the month, said a U.S.
[00:54:07.075 --> 00:54:09.016]  Customs and Border Protection official.
[00:54:09.497 --> 00:54:13.319]  Passenger processing time is the number one priority, again he said.
[00:54:14.315 --> 00:54:15.697]  Folks, it's always been this way.
[00:54:16.357 --> 00:54:22.725]  All these terror alerts, all this fear-mongering is simply there to train you to accept giving up your liberty.
[00:54:23.366 --> 00:54:24.127]  That's all they're doing.
[00:54:24.948 --> 00:54:30.975]  They're there to train you that black ski masks and submachine guns and Nazi helmets equals safety.
[00:54:31.375 --> 00:54:33.498]  There are less border patrol on the southern border.
[00:54:33.848 --> 00:54:35.829]  There are less Border Patrol on the northern border.
[00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:41.432]  They pay them an average of $24,000 more a year to become air marshals.
[00:54:41.933 --> 00:54:44.894]  They're giving new duties all the time to the Border Patrol.
[00:54:44.914 --> 00:54:48.556]  They're being shot at and killed on a routine basis by Mexican troops.
[00:54:48.896 --> 00:54:54.239]  They're telling them they're not allowed to go in certain areas or not allowed to go after illegals in certain corridors.
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:58.582]  They're telling them that they've got to go and pick up the trash along the side of the highway.
[00:54:58.982 --> 00:55:02.244]  And so, obviously, a lot of Border Patrol agents are quitting or leaving.
[00:55:02.796 --> 00:55:11.404]  In fact, there were some mysterious circumstances two weeks ago when a Border Patrol agent, or about a week and a half ago, drowned on the southern border.
[00:55:12.565 --> 00:55:20.692]  According to eyewitnesses, he was in a scuffle with some of the illegals, but the official story is he fell into the river and drowned.
[00:55:21.113 --> 00:55:23.555]  So that's just some of the news that's going on.
[00:55:24.639 --> 00:55:28.120]  I want to get into the economic view here, what's happening there.
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:31.861]  Father of the Euro calls for a global currency.
[00:55:32.441 --> 00:55:40.823]  Robert Mundell, a Nobel Prize winning economist, often credited with paving the way for the European single currency, has called for a global currency.
[00:55:41.103 --> 00:55:42.203]  We'll get to that when we get back.
[00:55:42.243 --> 00:55:53.986]  I'll try to finish my comments about Bush, the fake Texan, and these staged, managed chainsaw and cutting events and quail hunting.
[00:55:54.417 --> 00:55:56.738]  How the neocons are saying how manly he is.
[00:55:56.798 --> 00:55:59.339]  It's like, oh, he landed on an aircraft carrier.
[00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:00.740]  He's so manly.
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:02.001]  He's such a fighter jock.
[00:56:02.041 --> 00:56:05.603]  And then it turns out he went AWOL from the Texas National Guard.
[00:56:05.643 --> 00:56:07.364]  I mean, it just staged, folks.
[00:56:07.604 --> 00:56:10.765]  And I'm not here attacking George Bush because I'm an evil liberal.
[00:56:11.125 --> 00:56:14.207]  I don't like George Bush because he's going to sign the assault weapons ban.
[00:56:14.447 --> 00:56:17.809]  But I have to hear neocons on the air talk about how pro-Second Amendment he is.
[00:56:18.229 --> 00:56:20.510]  Oh, look, he's out hunting quail.
[00:56:20.530 --> 00:56:22.911]  You know how hard it is to shoot quail?
[00:56:22.951 --> 00:56:24.112]  How manly that is?
[00:56:24.781 --> 00:56:29.964]  I actually heard Rush Limbaugh's sub in the rebroadcast this weekend saying that.
[00:56:30.884 --> 00:56:31.584]  Just amazing.
[00:56:32.565 --> 00:56:40.689]  Also, an Israeli member of parliament proposes ethnic cleansing, tolerant death threats from the academic left.
[00:56:40.709 --> 00:56:41.929]  They say tolerate those.
[00:56:42.389 --> 00:56:43.510]  Just so much more.
[00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:44.250]  You don't want to miss it.
[00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:44.791]  Stay with us.
[00:56:48.772 --> 00:56:49.673]  We're on the march.
[00:56:50.153 --> 00:56:51.654]  The empire's on the run.
[00:56:52.681 --> 00:56:55.378]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.676 --> 00:57:01.718]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[00:57:01.898 --> 00:57:03.539]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot!
[00:57:03.679 --> 00:57:11.665]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[00:57:11.905 --> 00:57:18.330]  Imagine, hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini, followed by peaches, mixed fruit, or pineapple for dessert.
[00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:19.771]  Just a few of the many selections.

[00:57:23.493 --> 00:57:27.036]  Both FEMA and the Red Cross have suggested having food stored in case of disaster.
[00:57:27.276 --> 00:57:32.779]  The Long Life Food Depot was recently mentioned in the USA Today article on the very subject of emergency preparations.
[00:57:33.079 --> 00:57:35.801]  It makes sense to be prepared and Long Life Food Depot makes it easy.
[00:57:36.001 --> 00:57:40.023]  Long-term storable MREs make for convenience when camping, hiking or canoeing.
[00:57:40.244 --> 00:57:41.124]  No fires allowed?

[00:57:58.393 --> 00:57:58.833]  Gold.

[00:58:00.714 --> 00:58:02.334]  From the Romans through the Renaissance.

[00:58:04.915 --> 00:58:06.816]  Gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:58:06.996 --> 00:58:10.818]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:58:11.158 --> 00:58:13.059]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:58:13.119 --> 00:58:13.279]  Mint,
[00:58:13.639 --> 00:58:15.400]  Demand is at an all-time high.
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:23.263]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[00:58:40.509 --> 00:58:40.929]  I think so.
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:59.042]  Did you know you've been cheated?
[00:58:59.142 --> 00:59:01.884]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[00:59:02.085 --> 00:59:02.825]  You heard that right.
[00:59:02.965 --> 00:59:05.588]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[00:59:05.728 --> 00:59:06.769]  You don't have to pay them off.
[00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:08.451]  The banks are defrauding you.
[00:59:08.711 --> 00:59:10.173]  Now is the time to fight back.
[00:59:10.373 --> 00:59:12.935]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.

[00:59:38.158 --> 00:59:44.002]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:07.941 --> 01:00:10.962]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:14.363 --> 01:00:16.964]  Alright, again my friends, we're live here.
[01:00:16.984 --> 01:00:21.625]  It is the fifth day of the new year on this Monday edition.
[01:00:22.805 --> 01:00:30.848]  Let me continue with some of the news, then we'll get to Wesley and Lester and Garrett and James and many others that are patiently holding the toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:30.988 --> 01:00:31.648]  Before I get into the
[01:00:35.307 --> 01:00:40.809]  Falling dollar and the call for now a global currency as we said many years ago they would do.
[01:00:42.490 --> 01:01:02.559]  The reason I spent some time in the first hour getting into Bush and the theater stage that they have set up in Crawford, Texas, just a few miles up the road from where I sit right now, is because it is indicative of the entire system.
[01:01:04.209 --> 01:01:05.770]  And I've gone over some of the examples.
[01:01:07.111 --> 01:01:20.463]  Where in Indiana, Bush had all of the thousands of people in an auditorium take their ties off because they wanted to project the image of common folk.
[01:01:22.244 --> 01:01:28.069]  They had the turkey that no one was allowed to eat that had been put together by one of these
[01:01:29.659 --> 01:01:33.822]  One of these super chefs that was reported to work for a major food magazine.
[01:01:33.862 --> 01:01:35.323]  It was a photo op.
[01:01:36.644 --> 01:01:39.145]  And we know that other politicians do this.
[01:01:40.266 --> 01:01:53.034]  My point is that when you watch the news or listen to a politician or look at what their statements are on an issue, you need to be conscious of the fact that they are projecting an image that they are trying to manipulate you.
[01:01:54.435 --> 01:01:57.617]  And I know so many people in Texas that are just so proud that
[01:01:57.950 --> 01:02:12.113]  Bush is from Texas, and he's such a great Texan, and oh, he's so manly, and oh, look at how he runs that chainsaw, and oh, he's this incredible quail hunter, and we're so lucky to have a guy like this.
[01:02:12.913 --> 01:02:26.156]  It's admittedly a stage out there they bought right before the election, and he goes out there and dresses up in a cowboy hat, and cuts some little branches with a giant chainsaw, and drinks some bottled water,
[01:02:26.778 --> 01:02:37.168]  Struts around in cowboy boots and holds up a dead quail and we all say, man, we've got a good Christian conservative from Texas who we can trust.
[01:02:37.268 --> 01:02:38.189]  It's an illusion.
[01:02:39.210 --> 01:02:40.131]  It's branding.
[01:02:41.172 --> 01:02:44.375]  It's an advertisement technique.
[01:02:45.656 --> 01:02:48.419]  And so much of what they do is along these lines.
[01:02:52.785 --> 01:03:20.892]  It's incredible, and with all these other things happening, the dollar plunging and the open borders, and all the new gun legislation, and the chemtrailing, and the fluoride in the water, and the genetic engineering, and the cloning, this sounds pretty petty to be covering so much, but it is just such an illustration, such an example, a tell-tale sign, as they say,
[01:03:21.671 --> 01:03:22.853]  Of what we're dealing with.
[01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:23.814]  Phoniness.
[01:03:24.054 --> 01:03:24.855]  Illusion.
[01:03:25.696 --> 01:03:27.578]  Form over substance.
[01:03:28.679 --> 01:03:34.245]  The neocons of talk radio and Fox News talk about how conservative George W. Bush is.
[01:03:35.005 --> 01:03:40.171]  In reality, he's not a conservative, and you know I can rattle off hundreds of examples of this.
[01:03:40.471 --> 01:03:43.174]  I'm sure you have a few examples in your own mind.
[01:03:44.229 --> 01:03:52.974]  But it doesn't matter to a lot of good, decent, conservative people, because we've been trained to only look on the surface of things as a nation of spectators.
[01:03:53.074 --> 01:04:05.361]  So, George W. Bush must really be okay, because, after all, every time we turn on television, he's wearing a cowboy hat, running a chainsaw, and, you know, a good, common person like that, well, you gotta trust him.
[01:04:08.382 --> 01:04:11.384]  And they have certainly laid up this whole
[01:04:11.994 --> 01:04:12.775]  Texan thing.
[01:04:12.815 --> 01:04:19.999]  I've seen Bush in different speeches shift back into his Kenny Bunkport, Maine, blue-blood accent.
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:31.807]  But he's very careful, many times when I see him on television, to do that Texas drawl, and to have the little euphemisms that we use in this state.
[01:04:32.247 --> 01:04:37.070]  That's very insulting to me, because I'm a real Texan, and I'm not saying it's special to be a Texan.
[01:04:37.532 --> 01:04:42.174]  I don't care whether you're from Ohio or New York or Florida or California.
[01:04:42.554 --> 01:04:46.015]  If you love freedom, I love you, and I think folks are great all over the country.
[01:04:46.595 --> 01:04:54.818]  But I know if I came to your state and acted like I was from your state, and acted like I was part of your heritage, you would be irritated by that.
[01:04:55.378 --> 01:05:02.201]  It was like the New York police and firemen who booed Hillary Clinton when they announced her as a New Yorker.
[01:05:02.819 --> 01:05:04.660]  They booed her and said, get off the stage.
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:06.100]  You're not a New Yorker.
[01:05:06.381 --> 01:05:09.822]  You shouldn't be part of this benefit for police and firefighters.
[01:05:11.823 --> 01:05:14.784]  So again, it's part of the phoniness.
[01:05:14.904 --> 01:05:16.585]  And I'm insulted by that.
[01:05:16.905 --> 01:05:22.188]  All over the world they talk about the wild, crazy Texan in the White House who's attacking everyone.
[01:05:22.268 --> 01:05:24.088]  And you know how nuts he is.
[01:05:24.168 --> 01:05:26.930]  And we've got to stop these wild cowboys.
[01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:29.891]  And that's an illusion that they play up.
[01:05:30.484 --> 01:05:33.036]  And it's given my state a bad name, and I don't like it.
[01:05:33.237 --> 01:05:35.024]  And I agree with the Dixie Chicks!
[01:05:35.592 --> 01:05:39.693]  When they said that we're ashamed of George W. Bush.
[01:05:39.753 --> 01:05:41.434]  I'm ashamed of George W. Bush.
[01:05:41.694 --> 01:05:44.755]  I'm ashamed of William Jefferson Blythe Clinton.
[01:05:45.015 --> 01:05:46.716]  I'm ashamed of Albert Gore.
[01:05:46.976 --> 01:05:48.596]  I'm ashamed of Howard Dean.
[01:05:48.836 --> 01:05:54.178]  I'm ashamed of all these establishment candidates that they put out to us as if we've got some choice.
[01:05:54.478 --> 01:06:02.301]  When they're all pushing for the same agenda, in reality, their rhetoric is different, but their agenda, their program, is identical.
[01:06:04.394 --> 01:06:09.835]  You know, Willie Nelson came out last week and wrote a new ballad and he performed it this Saturday here in Austin.
[01:06:10.276 --> 01:06:20.278]  And in the ballad he talks about how much are lives worth for oil, how much can you trust a liar, somebody that's told you lies before.
[01:06:20.698 --> 01:06:23.359]  And Willie Nelson, he's a real Texan.
[01:06:23.945 --> 01:06:29.408]  And he said he doesn't care what neocons think about him when he speaks out against Bush.
[01:06:29.648 --> 01:06:31.109]  He said, I hope people get upset.
[01:06:31.409 --> 01:06:36.211]  I hope people out there don't want to buy my records because I know who I am.
[01:06:36.491 --> 01:06:38.052]  He said, they may say, who are you?
[01:06:38.092 --> 01:06:38.973]  Who do you think you are?
[01:06:39.193 --> 01:06:40.714]  He said, I know who I am.
[01:06:44.295 --> 01:06:49.198]  So all I'm asking people to do is to start looking at things with a critical eye.
[01:06:49.258 --> 01:06:50.919]  Listen to this show with a critical ear.
[01:06:51.639 --> 01:06:52.980]  Don't believe the things I say.
[01:06:54.212 --> 01:07:01.778]  When I claim that the UN wants to dumb you down and take your private property, go check it out for yourself.
[01:07:01.958 --> 01:07:08.204]  When I claim that the elements of the government were behind 9-11, don't just poo-poo it and say, oh, that's not true.
[01:07:08.544 --> 01:07:10.706]  Go investigate it for yourself.
[01:07:11.947 --> 01:07:12.667]  It's that simple.
[01:07:13.748 --> 01:07:15.109]  We've got to start doing this.
[01:07:15.149 --> 01:07:16.791]  We've got to start looking
[01:07:18.231 --> 01:07:19.691]  At the news, behind the news.
[01:07:19.711 --> 01:07:24.653]  We've got to start evaluating the real agenda, the program, not the rhetoric.
[01:07:25.953 --> 01:07:29.754]  Because in this election coming up this year, it doesn't matter who's elected.
[01:07:30.794 --> 01:07:33.455]  It could be Dennis Kucinich.
[01:07:34.835 --> 01:07:35.835]  It could be Howard Dean.
[01:07:35.855 --> 01:07:37.336]  It could be George W. Bush.
[01:07:38.316 --> 01:07:41.657]  When it really comes down to it, they're all for UNESCO and the UN.
[01:07:42.917 --> 01:07:44.417]  They're all for more gun control.
[01:07:44.437 --> 01:07:47.618]  They're all for more taxes and regulations.
[01:07:49.904 --> 01:07:52.346]  Kucinich wants the UN to control Iraq.
[01:07:52.386 --> 01:07:54.988]  Kucinich wants a, quote, liberal world government.
[01:07:55.249 --> 01:07:57.470]  And Bush wants the, quote, conservative world government.
[01:07:57.691 --> 01:08:01.394]  See how they've neutralized the debate about, we don't want a world government?
[01:08:01.674 --> 01:08:05.097]  No, now there's a discussion of, what type of world government will it be?
[01:08:05.577 --> 01:08:07.459]  And again, that'll only be on the surface.
[01:08:07.699 --> 01:08:10.702]  What type of rhetoric will the world government espouse?
[01:08:10.962 --> 01:08:17.948]  But the actions, a world sales tax, a world ID card, a world currency, a world judiciary,
[01:08:18.388 --> 01:08:21.612]  And I shouldn't even use the word judiciary because it's kangaroo courts.
[01:08:23.114 --> 01:08:23.894]  It's a fraud.
[01:08:23.995 --> 01:08:28.500]  So these are the issues we should all be thinking about because it affects us mightily.
[01:08:30.262 --> 01:08:39.172]  Again, your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes, folks, but I'm just so angry over the process of acing.
[01:08:39.983 --> 01:08:51.290]  As it's called by members of customs at the airports and the borders where illegal aliens, people coming in without visas just pour through and they're not even allowed to look at their paperwork.
[01:08:52.451 --> 01:08:55.413]  And now this is back in the news.
[01:08:55.593 --> 01:09:03.918]  It's continuing because of another memo from Homeland Security ordering customs at the airports to not do their job.
[01:09:04.018 --> 01:09:08.441]  And then they tell us as citizens that we've got to give up our liberty to get some security.
[01:09:08.501 --> 01:09:09.081]  We've got to have the
[01:09:09.363 --> 01:09:17.666]  Pentagon watching our purchases and looking at our bank accounts and looking through our walls with their ground-penetrating radar.
[01:09:18.226 --> 01:09:19.346]  It makes me very angry.
[01:09:20.587 --> 01:09:24.268]  Forex dollar hits record low versus Euro.
[01:09:25.308 --> 01:09:27.229]  This is out of Reuters.
[01:09:28.529 --> 01:09:38.433]  The dollar fell to a record low against the Euro on Monday after Federal Reserve officials at the Central Bank is right to hold interest rates at a 45-year low, even though the U.S.
[01:09:38.453 --> 01:09:38.853]  economy
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:42.142]  Oh yeah, the jobless recovery.
[01:09:42.182 --> 01:09:43.142]  I love that double speak.
[01:09:43.723 --> 01:09:57.090]  The prospect of interest rates remaining low is likely to encourage the outflow of funds from the United States to higher yielding currencies at a time when the United States needs capital inflow to cover its current account deficit.
[01:09:58.091 --> 01:09:58.631]  The U.S.
[01:09:58.791 --> 01:10:06.936]  external shortfall, a major worry of international investors, is also likely to come under growing pressure because economic recovery could lead to more imports.
[01:10:07.998 --> 01:10:14.222]  Well yeah, we have each month new record trade deficits with 100 plus third world countries.
[01:10:16.223 --> 01:10:28.190]  And as the dollar plunges, the average American isn't aware of the fact that the funds they have in the bank, their assets, everything they own, has been devalued by 30 plus percent.
[01:10:28.210 --> 01:10:30.891]  We're becoming a third world country.
[01:10:32.492 --> 01:10:33.873]  Then they point at the stock market,
[01:10:34.837 --> 01:10:38.699]  That's up dramatically, though it's not up to the high of two and a half years ago.
[01:10:39.739 --> 01:10:42.960]  They point to the stock market and say, oh look how it's up.
[01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:47.382]  Yeah, but it's not up compared to the ratio of how far the dollars dropped.
[01:10:47.722 --> 01:10:52.204]  They're simply readjusting those cash values of each piece of stock.
[01:10:53.684 --> 01:10:59.947]  And they could raise interest rates and foreign investment would come back in to the dollar.
[01:11:00.947 --> 01:11:03.648]  But you notice they didn't decide to lower
[01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:10.552]  The interest rates until the Euro was announced, and already coming out in a bold fashion.
[01:11:11.232 --> 01:11:22.137]  And so they then lower interest rates, weakening the dollar, and Treasury Secretary Snowe comes out and publicly bad mouths it, and says it's good to have a dropping dollar, that it'll help manufacturing.
[01:11:22.397 --> 01:11:25.979]  But it hasn't done that, and the trade deficits again are at record levels.
[01:11:26.279 --> 01:11:31.641]  On top of this, the father of the Euro is calling for a new global currency.
[01:11:32.853 --> 01:11:40.197]  Robert Mundell, a Nobel Prize winning economist, often credited with paving the way for the European single currency, has called for a global currency.
[01:11:40.237 --> 01:11:49.222]  In an interview with French paper Liberation, Mr. Mundell said, with the emergence of the Euro and its instability against the dollar, Europe and the U.S.
[01:11:49.242 --> 01:11:53.965]  and Asia powers should come together and create a new international monetary system.
[01:11:55.145 --> 01:11:55.946]  Now, did you hear that?
[01:11:55.966 --> 01:12:00.008]  I remember ten years ago when I started really researching the New World Order.
[01:12:01.297 --> 01:12:23.907]  I read the Globalist documents and statements about how they would form a European Union, that would shine, drive down the dollar, then they would form a Pan-American Union and have an Amero-dollar, then Asia would see that, merge its currencies, that would then cause volatility, and then the answer would be, okay, let's merge all of them.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:26.782]  And that will be done digitally.
[01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:29.324]  That will be done by computers and smart cards.
[01:12:29.564 --> 01:12:31.506]  You'll still have your Japanese Yen.
[01:12:31.786 --> 01:12:33.308]  You'll still have your dollars.
[01:12:33.528 --> 01:12:35.650]  You'll still have your Euros.
[01:12:36.405 --> 01:12:49.395]  But those will be held at a certain benchmark value, and that will all be accredited and controlled by the World ID Card.
[01:12:49.615 --> 01:13:00.064]  But again, you'll still have your National ID Card, but it'll have the same number of prefixes and same design, hooked into the same system, making it a World ID Card.
[01:13:00.264 --> 01:13:05.728]  But the idiot on the street will still argue with you, saying, oh no, this is just a National ID Card.
[01:13:06.633 --> 01:13:09.794]  And the article goes on to say just that, and that's the plan.
[01:13:10.314 --> 01:13:12.835]  However, this would not mean the end of the euro and the dollar.
[01:13:13.275 --> 01:13:16.796]  Mr. Mundell continues, of course, one would keep the dollar and the euro.
[01:13:17.237 --> 01:13:24.239]  This international currency would be used in large international exchanges for movements of capital and commercial transactions.
[01:13:24.279 --> 01:13:33.622]  So again, you'll have all your different world currencies, but they'll all be at the same benchmark, and they'll be pooled now in a global currency that again will
[01:13:34.631 --> 01:13:37.472]  Dominate the other currencies and have a greater value.
[01:13:37.932 --> 01:13:41.973]  And within a year of this being implemented, you will just shift to the new global currency.
[01:13:42.653 --> 01:13:44.353]  And it's amazing.
[01:13:44.774 --> 01:13:48.034]  Mr. Mundell's views, although controversial, should not be discounted.
[01:13:48.294 --> 01:13:57.437]  He laid the intellectual groundwork for the Euro and was a leading member of the 72 Study Group on Economic and Monetary Union, which paved the way for the single currency.
[01:13:57.737 --> 01:14:02.898]  By the way, I read, as I said a decade ago, that document, Economic and Monetary Union.
[01:14:03.982 --> 01:14:07.804]  And it was in that plan they laid out what I just stated.
[01:14:08.124 --> 01:14:10.125]  Again, the globalist plans are all public.
[01:14:10.465 --> 01:14:11.506]  They're public, folks.
[01:14:12.486 --> 01:14:14.547]  Making you take hundreds of vaccines a year.
[01:14:14.788 --> 01:14:16.268]  Putting vaccines in your food.
[01:14:16.949 --> 01:14:20.310]  Taking your children at age 5 to grow up in school dormitories.
[01:14:20.631 --> 01:14:25.913]  Putting the entire population on Ritalin and Fetamin-type drugs and Prozac-type drugs.
[01:14:26.454 --> 01:14:27.654]  Socializing health care.
[01:14:27.694 --> 01:14:30.416]  Making you do all this or you don't get your health care.
[01:14:31.036 --> 01:14:32.977]  Forcing us all into compact cities.
[01:14:34.358 --> 01:14:36.079]  Again, it's all their plans.
[01:14:36.139 --> 01:14:38.620]  Taking all our guns is the stated U.N.
[01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:39.080]  plan.
[01:14:40.801 --> 01:14:49.705]  All I'm doing on this show is covering what their plan is, but the neocons and the liberals, the liberals will call you a Nazi if you talk about the New World Order.
[01:14:50.646 --> 01:14:53.367]  The neocons will call you a communist.
[01:14:54.864 --> 01:14:57.485]  That's, and it's a label, it's simple.
[01:14:58.125 --> 01:15:04.926]  If somebody talks about world government, they're a raving lunatic racist, the left will say, why that's code for racism.
[01:15:05.266 --> 01:15:10.487]  And the right wing phonies will get up there and say it's leftist anarchist tripe.
[01:15:10.827 --> 01:15:14.708]  When all we're doing is covering what's actually happening.
[01:15:16.568 --> 01:15:18.349]  Let us go ahead now and go to the calls.
[01:15:18.369 --> 01:15:22.210]  We'll go to Wesley and then many others.
[01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:23.990]  Wesley in Tennessee, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:15:25.188 --> 01:15:26.429]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:15:26.789 --> 01:15:51.745]  Before I say anything else, let me take this opportunity to wish you, Alex, and your family, and the entire staff, excuse me, for the program, and for all of America's true patriots, a Happy New Year, and ask that God bless each and every one of you, and that Christ keep and protect each and every
[01:15:52.757 --> 01:15:57.959]  Each and every member of your family and, like I say, the staff and all of America's Patriots.
[01:15:58.039 --> 01:15:58.680]  Well, thank you.
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.400]  Wesley, what's on your mind?
[01:16:01.121 --> 01:16:16.147]  There's another talk show host, and I won't dignify or acknowledge who that host is or what time his program comes on, but he really embodies the problem that we Patriots face in this country.
[01:16:17.047 --> 01:16:21.529]  He has had on his program many of the same guests that have appeared on your show.
[01:16:23.223 --> 01:16:29.764]  Those guests have explained in detail the exact same things that they've expressed on your program.
[01:16:30.864 --> 01:16:50.628]  And this man sits and listens to all of this, and says, you know, this all makes sense to me, and it sounds like it has merit, but in spite of that, there's something in me that just wants me to believe that the American government really isn't capable of doing something like this.
[01:16:51.795 --> 01:16:53.496]  And that's really the problem that we have.
[01:16:53.616 --> 01:17:01.522]  It's just, you know, you can give people these facts until there's a snowstorm in hell itself.
[01:17:02.863 --> 01:17:13.490]  But until we can get people past this silly mindset that it can't happen here in America, we're really running our heads into a brick wall.
[01:17:14.231 --> 01:17:17.673]  And that's really the toughest fight
[01:17:18.683 --> 01:17:21.705]  That any of us, Alex, that are true patriots have to fight.
[01:17:21.765 --> 01:17:44.618]  And it's getting people over this notion that this is not the same America that my father fought in during World War II, that this is a totally different country, and that we can't trust the people in government, that we do have betrayers in our midst that wish to take away all of our freedoms, take away our national sovereignty,
[01:17:45.657 --> 01:17:49.039]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:17:49.079 --> 01:17:52.220]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:54.561]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:17:54.581 --> 01:17:55.162]  The New World Order.
[01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:15.591]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:18:28.973 --> 01:18:39.306]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:18:39.586 --> 01:18:44.893]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:21:11.205 --> 01:21:13.527]  We've got a whole other hour coming up at you.
[01:21:14.587 --> 01:21:19.210]  We're about to go to Garrett and James and Tom and Bill and others.
[01:21:19.230 --> 01:21:22.111]  Let me just read part of this article now, then we'll go right to your calls.
[01:21:23.172 --> 01:21:24.813]  This is out of the West Australian.
[01:21:24.833 --> 01:21:32.157]  I also have one here out of Reuters and another one from the Associated Press.
[01:21:33.167 --> 01:21:36.489]  Here's one, Jersey's Brave New World.
[01:21:37.870 --> 01:21:47.796]  It says, the lame duck New Jersey State Assembly is poised today, Monday, to pass a bill members of President Bush's Council on Bioethics contend will permit human cloning.
[01:21:48.496 --> 01:21:56.601]  This manipulation plows new ground in the struggle over whether there should be moral limits on science's relentless thrust
[01:21:56.991 --> 01:21:59.492]  With federal anti-cloning legislation stalled in the U.S.
[01:21:59.532 --> 01:22:04.112]  Senate, the Garden State takes the first step towards a brave new world.
[01:22:04.593 --> 01:22:10.094]  There's the article out of the New Australian here, the West Australian.
[01:22:10.674 --> 01:22:13.494]  Embryo research go ahead in weeks.
[01:22:14.475 --> 01:22:26.597]  The federal government will approve the first experiments on excess IVF embryos within weeks following applications from universities
[01:22:27.265 --> 01:22:30.707]  Research institutes and private companies.
[01:22:31.267 --> 01:22:42.712]  And in an effort to counter concerns over the controversial research, the government will employ two inspectors to ensure its laws on the cloning and embryo use are not broken.
[01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:43.933]  Oh, so don't worry.
[01:22:43.953 --> 01:22:53.277]  They're going to let you clone babies and use the body parts, basically, and use the different DNA that they can extract from them for other uses.
[01:22:53.737 --> 01:22:55.758]  And the government's going to regulate it, so it's okay.
[01:22:55.778 --> 01:22:56.999]  Just like they regulate abortion.
[01:22:57.938 --> 01:23:02.080]  Scientists believe as many as 15 different groups could be vying for licenses.
[01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:04.601]  And it gets all into what they're going to do.
[01:23:04.641 --> 01:23:06.641]  I want to cover that some in the next hour.
[01:23:07.002 --> 01:23:08.882]  Right now, let's talk to Garrett in Louisiana.
[01:23:08.902 --> 01:23:09.723]  Garrett, you're on the air.
[01:23:09.743 --> 01:23:10.163]  Go ahead.
[01:23:10.183 --> 01:23:11.223]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:23:11.283 --> 01:23:11.563]  Good.
[01:23:11.844 --> 01:23:12.844]  It's good to hear that, man.
[01:23:13.364 --> 01:23:14.024]  A couple things.
[01:23:14.104 --> 01:23:18.946]  First of all, my dad and I were watching Dan Brokjaw, one of those guys, the other night.
[01:23:19.507 --> 01:23:22.188]  They were showing film from England with Mad Cow.
[01:23:23.428 --> 01:23:25.249]  And my daddy said, look, he said, my uncle's
[01:23:25.959 --> 01:23:29.820]  Back in the 50s and 60s, sometimes my uncle's cows would get like that.
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:31.180]  They would just die.
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:39.562]  They would just shake like that, ram the fence, and just fall down and act like a mad cow.
[01:23:39.582 --> 01:23:43.342]  You're familiar with cattle diseases.
[01:23:43.402 --> 01:23:44.903]  Everybody says, oh, that's the black leg.
[01:23:44.923 --> 01:23:46.123]  That's the black leg.
[01:23:46.183 --> 01:23:47.603]  Nothing to worry about.
[01:23:47.963 --> 01:23:51.524]  That stuff has been in this country a whole lot longer than
[01:23:53.743 --> 01:24:00.626]  Well, there's also a lot of other diseases or problems that will make a cow fall down or start shaking or go crazy.
[01:24:01.407 --> 01:24:09.551]  There's lots of diseases that do that to humans that aren't related to the spongiforms that grow in the brains of mammals.
[01:24:10.131 --> 01:24:14.253]  But yes, a mad cow has been here for a long time.
[01:24:14.293 --> 01:24:19.235]  We've had literally dozens of scientists on the show going over the evidence of this, and now it's admitted.
[01:24:19.255 --> 01:24:20.696]  I even have Associated Press articles
[01:24:21.049 --> 01:24:33.676]  Where they admit that a lot of the Alzheimer cases that we hear about are really Creutzfeldt-Jacobs, and then a lot of those Creutzfeldt-Jacobs are connected to people eating the diseased parts of cows.
[01:24:34.176 --> 01:24:35.417]  Well, that's interesting.
[01:24:35.497 --> 01:24:36.797]  I'll do some follow-up research.
[01:24:37.198 --> 01:24:43.621]  But the brain matter, you know, that comes from the cows, that's really, you know, hot dogs, you know, sausage, stuff like that.
[01:24:43.641 --> 01:24:47.383]  That's where that goes in, you know, where they have miscellaneous parts on the ingredients.
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:54.005]  That's what we really need to watch out for, as far as I understand from the Department of Agriculture.
[01:24:54.025 --> 01:24:56.467]  I don't know if you can trust me, but the regular meat's fine.
[01:24:56.527 --> 01:25:06.935]  Well, from the scientists we've interviewed, that is true, that it's safer to eat the whole meat, not to eat the brain and spinal cord parts.
[01:25:07.415 --> 01:25:16.823]  The problem is, during the slaughtering, the big bolt that goes in the head, and the brain splattering, and when they cut the T-bones off the spine, the juice gets into them.
[01:25:17.698 --> 01:25:19.119]  That's some of the problems.
[01:25:19.239 --> 01:25:20.639]  Also, you should avoid T-bone.
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:26.822]  Well, Alex, I just want to tell everybody to get the 5 B's and prepare.
[01:25:26.842 --> 01:25:27.882]  That's all we can do, man.
[01:25:27.942 --> 01:25:29.323]  Get the information out.
[01:25:29.343 --> 01:25:30.403]  What are the 5 B's?
[01:25:30.663 --> 01:25:31.984]  Bullets, beans, Bibles?
[01:25:32.764 --> 01:25:35.305]  Band-Aids and Bullion.
[01:25:35.765 --> 01:25:36.045]  All right.
[01:25:36.065 --> 01:25:36.966]  Good to hear from you, sir.
[01:25:37.486 --> 01:25:38.466]  Appreciate that call.
[01:25:38.506 --> 01:25:43.068]  We'll come back and talk to James and Tom and Bill and others and get into cloning and
[01:25:44.134 --> 01:25:46.976]  Israel, some of the folks there want ethnic cleansing.
[01:25:49.098 --> 01:25:57.724]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:25:57.944 --> 01:26:09.213]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:26:09.433 --> 01:26:12.075]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:26:12.395 --> 01:26:18.860]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:20.902]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:26:21.102 --> 01:26:27.127]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:26:27.367 --> 01:26:33.052]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[01:26:33.372 --> 01:26:36.694]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[01:26:41.678 --> 01:26:41.859]  803-4438.
[01:26:41.919 --> 01:26:46.162]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:26:46.242 --> 01:26:47.563]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:26:55.129 --> 01:26:55.790]  Big Brother.
[01:26:56.450 --> 01:26:57.471]  Mainstream media.
[01:26:58.212 --> 01:26:59.313]  Government cover-ups.
[01:26:59.973 --> 01:27:00.774]  You want answers?
[01:27:01.554 --> 01:27:02.475]  Well, so does he.
[01:27:02.495 --> 01:27:06.759]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:07.299 --> 01:27:09.641]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:27:10.524 --> 01:27:11.385]  Alex Jones!
[01:27:11.605 --> 01:27:30.138]  Alright my friends, we're back live now into the third and final hour of this January 5th, 2004 Monday edition, and we've got wide open phones.
[01:27:30.739 --> 01:27:34.641]  Coming up, North Korea to be asked to be nuclear free.
[01:27:35.582 --> 01:27:38.284]  They're saying, now you can't even have those nuclear reactors.
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:44.922]  And the people calling for them to be nuclear-free are those that sold them the reactors to begin with.
[01:27:45.002 --> 01:27:51.424]  And his name is Donald Rumsfeld, the chairman of the board of ABB, the company that did it.
[01:27:52.305 --> 01:28:00.248]  More on the cloning bill, New Jersey cloning bill, likely to reignite national debate, state-sanctioned stem cell research.
[01:28:00.748 --> 01:28:06.270]  Now, when they say stem cell, they mean embryos, and they get into that here in the articles.
[01:28:07.014 --> 01:28:10.936]  Also, coordinating and quarantining dissent.
[01:28:11.136 --> 01:28:13.297]  Quarantining.
[01:28:13.357 --> 01:28:14.478]  I suddenly can't talk today.
[01:28:14.498 --> 01:28:17.900]  I'm on a different microphone, different studio, and it's kind of like riding a new horse here.
[01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:20.281]  Quarantining dissent.
[01:28:20.321 --> 01:28:20.981]  There we go.
[01:28:21.401 --> 01:28:22.762]  Quarantining dissent.
[01:28:23.282 --> 01:28:27.064]  How the Secret Service protects Bush from free speech.
[01:28:27.104 --> 01:28:28.505]  This is out of the San Francisco Chronicle.
[01:28:29.005 --> 01:28:30.606]  And Bill Clinton started this.
[01:28:31.086 --> 01:28:35.128]  But it doesn't matter if you're a Republican or a Democrat, you should believe in the First Amendment.
[01:28:35.148 --> 01:28:36.069]  I want to go over that article.
[01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:41.661]  Also, Osama Bin Laden, a dead nemesis perpetuated by the U.S.
[01:28:41.721 --> 01:28:42.141]  government.
[01:28:42.761 --> 01:28:45.382]  And this is from WhatReallyHappened.com.
[01:28:45.402 --> 01:28:46.142]  I want to go over that.
[01:28:46.942 --> 01:28:51.483]  And also, China pondering its own green card system.
[01:28:52.383 --> 01:28:55.304]  And a lot more in this hour.
[01:28:55.644 --> 01:28:58.244]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:29:03.645 --> 01:29:08.549]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in Colorado.
[01:29:08.589 --> 01:29:09.570]  Thanks for holding, James.
[01:29:09.991 --> 01:29:10.931]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:29:10.971 --> 01:29:11.432]  You bet, sir.
[01:29:11.912 --> 01:29:14.194]  I'd like to make three points here.
[01:29:14.274 --> 01:29:18.418]  One about the Fed, one about the National Western Stock Show, and some about Israel.
[01:29:18.758 --> 01:29:19.919]  First about the Federal Reserve.
[01:29:20.479 --> 01:29:23.002]  There's an economist, his last name is Karnak.
[01:29:23.302 --> 01:29:25.444]  I'll get you his first name, I'll get you his website.
[01:29:26.064 --> 01:29:27.726]  And the video is called Money Matter.
[01:29:28.146 --> 01:29:29.587]  It's three and a half hours long.
[01:29:29.807 --> 01:29:30.668]  It's very in-depth.
[01:29:30.728 --> 01:29:31.529]  It's not for the
[01:29:32.350 --> 01:29:34.612]  Average fly-by-night person who's just interested in this.
[01:29:34.692 --> 01:29:35.993]  It's somebody who really wants to know.
[01:29:36.473 --> 01:29:48.323]  And he goes to in-depth on how, over the last 2,000 years, these powers have controlled the money flow of nations and how they create the depressions and everything.
[01:29:48.763 --> 01:29:53.327]  And just for a point of focus, there is a world currency already, and it's called the SBD.
[01:29:54.348 --> 01:30:01.654]  The Swiss banks in Switzerland are behind it, and the UN promotes it, and it is used for payable debt.
[01:30:02.074 --> 01:30:13.816]  And that's going to be the benchmark, and to do any international exchanges or large stock purchases or transfers, you'll have to transfer it over into that currency and change it.
[01:30:14.717 --> 01:30:15.777]  Okay, that was the first one.
[01:30:15.857 --> 01:30:20.938]  I will send you a website and information through mail about that, so you can give it to your listeners.
[01:30:21.478 --> 01:30:26.279]  My second one is about... I've seen the film, it's excellent, I've aired it about 30 times here in Austin.
[01:30:26.299 --> 01:30:28.399]  Good, so you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[01:30:28.759 --> 01:30:31.700]  Okay, my second point, I want to bring up the fact about Mad Cow.
[01:30:32.381 --> 01:30:35.062]  And it's linked to wasting disease and whirling disease.
[01:30:35.362 --> 01:30:45.467]  I live in Colorado, and there's a state college here where I live, and the very first confirmed cases of wasting diseases was confirmed in this state.
[01:30:45.907 --> 01:30:51.830]  And there's another disease called whirling disease that attacks fisheries in this state, and I'm sure in other states by now.
[01:30:52.450 --> 01:30:55.871]  And its relation to Mad Cow is that they're all related to prion.
[01:30:56.492 --> 01:31:01.814]  And it's these proteins that herbivores are not supposed to be processing that get into their systems,
[01:31:02.338 --> 01:31:04.039]  By some artificial mean.
[01:31:04.519 --> 01:31:11.044]  Now, the timing of all this is crucial because we have the National Western Stock Show coming up in Denver in the next couple weeks.
[01:31:11.544 --> 01:31:17.088]  Now, this is the largest meeting of stockmen and ranchers in the entire world.
[01:31:17.328 --> 01:31:20.930]  Not Colorado, not the nation, but the entire world.
[01:31:21.010 --> 01:31:23.271]  Hey, I tell you what, James, you're making some interesting points.
[01:31:23.772 --> 01:31:27.734]  Stay there, we'll come back to you after the break, then we'll go to Tom and Bill and others.
[01:31:28.135 --> 01:31:29.776]  Call the free number to join us on air, 1-800-STOCKS.
[01:31:30.555 --> 01:31:31.095]  2-5-9-9-2-3-1.
[01:31:33.436 --> 01:31:38.797]  Then I'll get back into Homeland Security saying, let them illegals in.
[01:31:38.857 --> 01:31:39.737]  Don't search them.
[01:31:39.757 --> 01:31:41.838]  That's only for citizens.
[01:31:42.478 --> 01:31:46.099]  And the whole cloning situation and quarantining dissent.
[01:31:46.419 --> 01:31:46.999]  So stay with us.
[01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:54.201]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[01:31:54.421 --> 01:31:55.821]  If so, hope has arrived.
[01:31:56.317 --> 01:31:57.758]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[01:31:58.039 --> 01:32:03.203]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[01:32:03.563 --> 01:32:08.047]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[01:32:08.368 --> 01:32:17.055]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[01:32:17.516 --> 01:32:18.617]  Gum disease is serious.
[01:32:19.133 --> 01:32:22.876]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[01:32:23.156 --> 01:32:29.780]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including Vitamir toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[01:32:30.121 --> 01:32:34.143]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.
[01:32:34.584 --> 01:32:36.545]  Order yours today from Cliff Scott Enterprises.

[01:32:51.623 --> 01:32:57.367]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:32:57.607 --> 01:33:02.751]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:33:03.091 --> 01:33:12.397]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:33:12.738 --> 01:33:17.661]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:33:18.001 --> 01:33:22.007]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:33:22.207 --> 01:33:27.013]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:33:27.354 --> 01:33:33.242]  The Berkey Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[01:33:49.417 --> 01:33:53.742]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:33:53.942 --> 01:33:58.348]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:33:58.508 --> 01:34:02.893]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:34:02.933 --> 01:34:04.274]  The New World Order.
[01:34:05.075 --> 01:34:06.037]  Can emerge.
[01:34:06.077 --> 01:34:10.282]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:34:10.342 --> 01:34:17.291]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:34:17.411 --> 01:34:19.394]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:34:19.793 --> 01:34:30.118]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:34:30.398 --> 01:34:35.760]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:35:01.381 --> 01:35:02.302]  Well, so does he.
[01:35:02.322 --> 01:35:06.583]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:07.143 --> 01:35:11.244]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:35:13.364 --> 01:35:19.805]  I do this show live, folks, Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central during the day, back from 9 to Midnight Central.
[01:35:19.825 --> 01:35:22.266]  The websites are InfoWars.com and
[01:35:22.912 --> 01:35:51.772]  PrisonPlanet.com, and we've added a lot of new features, a lot of new audio files, video files, government documents, hundreds of new news stories every day on those two websites, and I hope that you'll check them out and spread the word about InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and this week we have just lined up a ton of very informative, dynamic guests for you, so I hope that you'll be sure and join us and tell your friends, your families,
[01:35:52.362 --> 01:35:59.986]  Your neighbors who join us, no matter how you're listening, whether it's on your local AM or FM station, global, shortwave, or the internet.
[01:36:01.167 --> 01:36:05.249]  Let's go back to the calls, and again the toll-free number to join us, wide open phones today, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:36:05.269 --> 01:36:07.050]  We were talking to James in Colorado.
[01:36:12.322 --> 01:36:38.752]  And he was saying that they found these prions that they get from an infected food chain that starts with feeding rotten, diseased meat to herbivores that are not meant to eat meat, much less rotten meat that has these crystals growing in it that their stomachs cannot process that then precipitate out into the body tissues of
[01:36:39.779 --> 01:36:45.864]  Of the lamb and cow and they found it in pig and they even found some of it in chicken, folks.
[01:36:47.245 --> 01:36:50.128]  And they've been covering this up for a long time.
[01:36:50.568 --> 01:37:01.137]  And yes, I have read that they have found some of these problems because they take the really diseased parts of cows and horses and dogs and cats.
[01:37:01.177 --> 01:37:04.860]  Did you know that in a lot of your pet foods it's euthanized dogs and cats?
[01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:07.302]  Yes, that's been in mainstream news, folks.
[01:37:07.662 --> 01:37:08.363]  They caught one of the big
[01:37:09.539 --> 01:37:14.760]  Dog and cat food makers two years ago doing that in a big Florida-based company.
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:24.582]  They then take all this rotten, affluent basically, all this detritus, and they do put it into different types of feeds.
[01:37:24.682 --> 01:37:29.243]  And they go to your pigs, and your chickens, and your fish, you name it.
[01:37:29.663 --> 01:37:38.165]  I'd seen one or two articles about fish dying from brainwashing diseases, but our caller was saying that he had some more news
[01:37:39.607 --> 01:37:48.309]  Well, this is my take on the whole situation.
[01:37:48.509 --> 01:38:02.832]  I live within six miles of a major fishery and about two or three miles next to a university facility that used to keep large herds of elk and study them and feed them different things.
[01:38:05.663 --> 01:38:17.152]  Part of the state where I live in, Colorado, are the first documented nationwide outbreaks of wasting disease and whirling disease, which are closely related to the mad cow thing.
[01:38:17.412 --> 01:38:26.800]  I know, five years ago you didn't hear about elk and mule deer and whitetail, and now from Texas to Colorado, from Oregon to New York,
[01:38:27.507 --> 01:38:39.141]  They're finding all different types of herbivores, foraging grass and berry eating types of deer dropping dead by the thousands from this.
[01:38:39.301 --> 01:38:43.626]  They do the study and they have the spongiform prions growing.
[01:38:44.182 --> 01:38:46.723]  This is a correlation I would make.
[01:38:48.364 --> 01:38:50.184]  Let me stop you for a second because you mentioned this.
[01:38:50.504 --> 01:38:53.725]  We know that Lyme disease came from Plum Island, New York.
[01:38:54.146 --> 01:39:04.029]  We know they were testing zoological bioweapons, admittedly, I have the congressional reports, on deer and other species of mammal at the base.
[01:39:04.836 --> 01:39:11.983]  And they admit that deer swam from the island, the quarter mile, into New York.
[01:39:12.583 --> 01:39:20.470]  And that is then where the first cases of Lyme disease showed up, was in the area right across the water from Plum Island.
[01:39:20.490 --> 01:39:24.133]  So I know that that happened there, government testing doing this.
[01:39:24.233 --> 01:39:28.017]  I don't know that it's happening in the case you mentioned, but it's okay to speculate, go ahead.
[01:39:28.590 --> 01:39:33.313]  Well, this is what I would urge everybody, and you had a call around from Northern Colorado last week.
[01:39:33.553 --> 01:39:43.740]  I would buy your beef farm direct when you can, from a farmer that you know what they're getting fed, and organic if you can, certified, you know, as much as we could trust that.
[01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:51.024]  But the National Western Stock Show is the largest in the world in Denver, and it is this next two weeks here in Colorado.
[01:39:51.205 --> 01:39:57.889]  And I would say the timing of the outbreak on the West Coast was timed coincide before this.
[01:39:59.507 --> 01:40:08.933]  To fluctuate the market and, you know, it's really... I'm a member of a non-profit organization called American Farmland Trust which supports America's family farms.
[01:40:09.333 --> 01:40:16.658]  And I would say, you know, in this time of what's happening, we need to support family farms and ranchers and stuff like that.
[01:40:17.098 --> 01:40:23.362]  And it's really a big play, a big power play by, like you talk about the corporate farming outfits.
[01:40:23.826 --> 01:40:25.808]  And what they get away with, and people know about that.
[01:40:25.828 --> 01:40:27.590]  Well, let me just say this, and I agree with you.
[01:40:27.690 --> 01:40:42.543]  From all the different pieces of evidence that I have on Mad Cow, and again from the dozens of scientists and doctors and ranchers and folks that have looked at this, it is clear that big agribusiness did this to us.
[01:40:42.864 --> 01:40:48.429]  And again, my family pays the taxes on our land in East Texas off the cows.
[01:40:49.184 --> 01:40:52.265]  Okay, I mean, it's basically a break-even operation.
[01:40:52.606 --> 01:40:56.928]  You know, we've got old 30-year-old, 25-year-old tractors, old equipment.
[01:40:57.708 --> 01:41:00.369]  It's very hard to, you know, pay for fixing fences.
[01:41:01.349 --> 01:41:06.732]  But we barely hang on to our ancestral land by doing that.
[01:41:07.352 --> 01:41:17.997]  And I am so angry, and I've been angry for years, by big agribusiness putting meat products, rotten meat products, into feeds, blood into feeds for calves.
[01:41:18.319 --> 01:41:31.864]  They're doing this to us now and now coming and saying they want to start radio tag and microchip tracking and federal regulation and control when 90 plus percent of the beef in this country is raised properly on open range.
[01:41:32.124 --> 01:41:35.665]  You don't want to feed your cattle feeds because it costs you more money.
[01:41:35.885 --> 01:41:40.727]  You want to have them on enough acreage where they can take care of themselves and forage for themselves.
[01:41:41.367 --> 01:41:43.868]  And this is very suspect.
[01:41:43.908 --> 01:41:45.429]  We know there's been mad cow.
[01:41:46.021 --> 01:42:00.263]  For over 10 years in this country, we know they've covered it up, we know they've found other mad cows, infected cows with CJD before, we know they've covered that up, that's confirmed, and the question is, why are they now announcing it?
[01:42:00.463 --> 01:42:03.384]  You're right, that's a very important question.
[01:42:03.424 --> 01:42:03.824]  Go ahead.
[01:42:04.224 --> 01:42:06.704]  Okay, Alex, one last comment and I'll let you go with it.
[01:42:06.885 --> 01:42:09.245]  You had the rabbi on a couple weeks ago.
[01:42:09.265 --> 01:42:10.445]  Oh, I don't want to talk about this anymore.
[01:42:10.465 --> 01:42:12.345]  Well, I know you don't, but I just wanted to make one comment.
[01:42:12.846 --> 01:42:14.366]  You made a comment about the U.S.
[01:42:14.426 --> 01:42:15.406]  Liberty never happening.
[01:42:15.874 --> 01:42:19.296]  On his show, and I've heard some really strange things on his show.
[01:42:19.337 --> 01:42:22.078]  He's very, very pro-globalist and stuff.
[01:42:22.419 --> 01:42:25.981]  I just wanted to let you know that that was one of his opinions, that the U.S.
[01:42:26.021 --> 01:42:27.262]  Liberty attack never took place.
[01:42:27.342 --> 01:42:35.188]  And I've heard some really militant Israeli defense people on his show calling for really bad things.
[01:42:35.288 --> 01:42:41.072]  And to tie in with the story I heard you talking about earlier about the ethnic cleansing comment in the Israeli parliament.
[01:42:41.707 --> 01:42:43.949]  Well, look, I'm not going to... I understand.
[01:42:43.969 --> 01:42:50.075]  I just wanted to mention that in passing and tell you that you do a great job and I hope more people listen to your show.
[01:42:50.115 --> 01:42:57.701]  I try to tell people every day about what's going on and that they should open up their minds and you do a great job and I just... Oh, hey, well, listen, listen, James.
[01:42:57.722 --> 01:42:58.362]  Thanks for the call.
[01:42:58.863 --> 01:43:03.607]  I'm not going to censor people calling into this show and talking about Rabbi Spivak.
[01:43:04.648 --> 01:43:08.131]  But frankly, I had him on for the torture debate
[01:43:08.957 --> 01:43:11.959]  And I think it's clear that he lost that debate.
[01:43:13.140 --> 01:43:17.063]  But I don't want to... I mean, I'll continue to discuss what Israel is doing.
[01:43:17.083 --> 01:43:19.685]  I'll continue to discuss the fact that torture is wrong.
[01:43:20.526 --> 01:43:24.969]  And if you want to call in about Rabbi Spivak, you're welcome to do it.
[01:43:25.630 --> 01:43:29.232]  I personally am sick of hearing about him.
[01:43:30.733 --> 01:43:35.137]  I get other calls about the stuff he talks about because he's on one of our wonderful affiliates.
[01:43:38.513 --> 01:43:50.758]  You know, the American Freedom Network's flagship station, great 10,000 watt affiliate, what is it, 1360, I believe, there in Colorado.
[01:43:50.818 --> 01:43:53.899]  I'm giving out the wrong affiliate frequency.
[01:43:53.919 --> 01:43:54.560]  I apologize.
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:56.000]  I'm not in my regular studio.
[01:43:56.521 --> 01:44:00.302]  There's some technical things going on with the ISDN line to Minnesota.
[01:44:06.175 --> 01:44:09.476]  I don't want to make my show particularly about one individual.
[01:44:09.716 --> 01:44:10.157]  That's all.
[01:44:11.017 --> 01:44:15.479]  And people can say whatever they want about me, and that I'm wrong because I'm against torture.
[01:44:16.039 --> 01:44:16.919]  And that's just fine.
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:26.303]  But since you mention that, let me read that article, then we'll go to Tom and Bill and many others that are patiently holding, and I will start going to these calls a little bit quicker.
[01:44:26.323 --> 01:44:33.406]  But since you mention that article, let me go ahead and go over that, because
[01:44:34.324 --> 01:44:47.987]  We have a member of the Israeli Parliament coming out and saying to the world that ethnic cleansing might be what's in order.
[01:44:48.047 --> 01:44:49.967]  That people are calling for that.
[01:44:50.788 --> 01:44:53.648]  Israeli Member of Parliament proposes ethnic cleansing.
[01:44:53.688 --> 01:45:02.070]  A member of the Israeli Parliament has proposed massive ethnic cleansing of non-Jews in Palestine and Israel as a final solution.
[01:45:02.955 --> 01:45:04.815]  Of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
[01:45:05.316 --> 01:45:07.696]  Now, folks, he used the quote, final solution.
[01:45:08.136 --> 01:45:10.397]  He used the quote, massive ethnic cleansing.
[01:45:11.917 --> 01:45:13.998]  Final solution?
[01:45:15.598 --> 01:45:23.300]  I mean, it's been pointed out that Israel, some of their policies are Nazi-like.
[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:30.582]  I mean, it's Nazi-like, even though it was pre-Nazi, for Americans to take Indians
[01:45:31.175 --> 01:45:35.580]  And starve them to death on plantations and to give them infected blankets.
[01:45:35.620 --> 01:45:36.381]  That was wrong.
[01:45:36.681 --> 01:45:38.803]  And that was my ancestors doing.
[01:45:38.843 --> 01:45:39.824]  And I can say it's wrong.
[01:45:40.425 --> 01:45:42.587]  And it's wrong some of the things that Israel's doing.
[01:45:43.468 --> 01:45:44.769]  Yes, there's suicide bombers.
[01:45:44.829 --> 01:45:46.912]  Yes, the Palestinians do some bad things.
[01:45:48.573 --> 01:45:51.336]  I'm not saying either side is spotless in this.
[01:45:53.464 --> 01:46:09.592]  But obviously, Abrams tanks and F-16s and F-15s bombing civilians looks really bad, and is really bad, and a lot of Israeli pilots and frontline soldiers have said this and have quit, and have been put in prison for it.
[01:46:10.492 --> 01:46:10.852]  Okay?
[01:46:11.713 --> 01:46:16.635]  And it says, Uzi Cohen, a member of Ariel Sharon's right-wing Likud party and a deputy
[01:46:17.133 --> 01:46:24.498]  In the Knesset, told Israeli Public Radio on Sunday, there was widespread support for Israel for the idea of ethnic cleansing.
[01:46:24.878 --> 01:46:29.101]  Many people support the idea, but few are willing to speak about it publicly.
[01:46:29.601 --> 01:46:39.188]  Cohen, an influential figure in Likud, proposed that Israel, the United States, and the European Union, as well as oil-rich Arab states, make assertive efforts to create a Palestinian state in northern Jordan.
[01:46:39.648 --> 01:46:43.771]  He suggested that we might discuss this
[01:46:44.736 --> 01:46:48.418]  This forbidden... Well, I'll come back and finish the quotes.
[01:46:49.599 --> 01:46:54.261]  Hi, this is Jack Browner with a gold alert from Midas Resources.
[01:46:54.681 --> 01:46:56.722]  Folks, it's time to shed your complacency.
[01:46:57.083 --> 01:46:59.664]  Gold has seldom, if ever, been a better buy.

[01:47:23.878 --> 01:47:27.340]  Or we can let you buy them later at a considerable higher price.
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:30.042]  Don't buy them later, folks.
[01:47:30.402 --> 01:47:31.223]  Do it now.
[01:47:31.483 --> 01:47:33.704]  That's $10 collector gold coins.
[01:47:34.085 --> 01:47:40.849]  $10 and $20 collector gold coins at the nearest amount in my 24 years in this business called Midas Resources.
[01:47:41.350 --> 01:47:41.891]  That's Midas at 800-686-2237.
[01:47:49.909 --> 01:47:50.489]  You've heard of it.
[01:47:50.569 --> 01:47:51.449]  You've searched for it.
[01:47:51.609 --> 01:47:52.330]  We have it.
[01:47:52.470 --> 01:47:54.090]  I'm talking about Coral Calcium.

[01:48:49.963 --> 01:48:56.205]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:48:56.345 --> 01:49:02.507]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:49:02.788 --> 01:49:11.230]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:49:11.471 --> 01:49:18.473]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.

[01:49:51.528 --> 01:49:56.431]  Are you concerned about the fact that so many of our children can't read or read properly?
[01:49:56.692 --> 01:50:03.736]  Are you concerned by the fact that we have almost 100 million Americans who are either partially or completely illiterate?
[01:50:04.136 --> 01:50:09.760]  Well, let me tell you that there is a program that you can get for your children and grandchildren, or perhaps even for yourself.
[01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:10.721]  It's called Monopoly.
[01:50:11.221 --> 01:50:18.325]  And we'll teach your children and your grandchildren and you to read phonetically and spell phonetically and pronounce words phonetically.
[01:50:18.425 --> 01:50:21.787]  It's designed by the same woman who created the Phonics game.
[01:50:22.227 --> 01:50:22.487]  This is $139.95.
[01:50:22.527 --> 01:50:30.672]  And, of course, it's five board games, two bonus games, played very similar to Monopoly.
[01:50:30.692 --> 01:50:37.456]  And it will train in about 16 hours your children or grandchildren how to read and spell and pronounce words phonetically.
[01:50:37.976 --> 01:50:39.057]  It's called Phonopoly.
[01:50:39.297 --> 01:50:45.622]  Give us a call at 1-800-544-8927 and ask about getting a Phonopoly set.
[01:50:55.289 --> 01:50:57.191]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:50:57.671 --> 01:51:00.513]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:51:02.795 --> 01:51:06.198]  Bottom line, folks, this, uh,
[01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:19.673]  A high-level member of the Likud party, Uzi Cohen, came out and used terms like, quote, massive ethnic cleansing and, quote, final solution.
[01:51:21.154 --> 01:51:22.734]  And that's just out of control.
[01:51:22.754 --> 01:51:30.336]  That's totally and completely out of control and wrong and just wildly arrogant, too.
[01:51:31.677 --> 01:51:32.537]  It's like Bush.
[01:51:34.677 --> 01:51:36.638]  You know, all the different things he's doing.
[01:51:37.777 --> 01:51:43.763]  are just so wildly arrogant and so over-the-top in our face.
[01:51:45.404 --> 01:51:58.277]  And I guess when you've got a culture that doesn't have any ideas of their own, a dumbed-down TV dinner culture, that people could hear anything and it's okay.
[01:51:58.417 --> 01:52:00.659]  And that's really the Orwellian double-think.
[01:52:01.531 --> 01:52:18.997]  Because you can have somebody like Arnold Schwarzenegger who says he hates black people and publicly screams the n-word and he gets praised by the liberal media and then you can have somebody who's never said anything racist in their life who talks about liberty and freedom and human dignity and oh that secret code for racism.
[01:52:19.997 --> 01:52:29.960]  I'm sick of it and I'm with the Israeli pilots who are quitting and refusing to drop bombs on apartment buildings where one terrorist is lurking
[01:52:31.341 --> 01:52:34.203]  Well, you know, we had to kill everybody because the terrorist was in there.
[01:52:34.943 --> 01:52:35.704]  I mean, that's wrong.
[01:52:35.764 --> 01:52:39.046]  We can't become the terrorist to fight the terrorist.
[01:52:39.186 --> 01:52:40.647]  It's just that simple.
[01:52:41.128 --> 01:52:42.389]  Let's go back to the calls here.
[01:52:43.229 --> 01:52:45.831]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tom in Ohio, then Bob and others.
[01:52:45.871 --> 01:52:46.672]  Tom, you're on the air.
[01:52:46.732 --> 01:52:47.032]  Welcome.
[01:52:47.813 --> 01:52:49.394]  Okay, Alex.
[01:52:49.694 --> 01:52:50.295]  We thank you.
[01:52:50.755 --> 01:52:51.455]  Well, thank you, sir.
[01:52:51.475 --> 01:52:51.876]  Go ahead.
[01:52:52.776 --> 01:52:58.561]  Yeah, I want to talk about a minister I gave movies to here probably about a year ago.
[01:53:01.116 --> 01:53:03.037]  Tell you what, let's put him on hold.
[01:53:03.117 --> 01:53:04.937]  Sir, do me a favor and turn your radio off.
[01:53:05.998 --> 01:53:09.599]  That would always be a really good thing, your speakerphone, whatever it is, echoing.
[01:53:09.619 --> 01:53:11.039]  Yeah, I got it off.
[01:53:11.199 --> 01:53:12.079]  Okay, go ahead, sir.
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:22.583]  Yeah, I gave movies to a minister about a year ago, and something called me to get over to him, and he's opened up now.
[01:53:22.843 --> 01:53:25.103]  He found out from another minister friend.
[01:53:25.703 --> 01:53:30.385]  He's got a friend in the government that's come and told him about the cancer ready and all that.
[01:53:31.553 --> 01:53:32.273]  He knows now.
[01:53:32.333 --> 01:53:33.894]  He's going to put them on TV now.
[01:53:34.214 --> 01:53:34.854]  We're going to run them.
[01:53:35.454 --> 01:53:37.034]  Okay, well this is very exciting.
[01:53:37.095 --> 01:53:38.675]  So you're saying movies.
[01:53:38.755 --> 01:53:39.535]  Whose videos?
[01:53:39.935 --> 01:53:40.515]  Yeah, yours.
[01:53:41.716 --> 01:53:42.316]  Your movies.
[01:53:42.836 --> 01:53:45.937]  I've been pressing them for probably going on three years now.
[01:53:46.217 --> 01:53:56.160]  So you gave this to the pastor, you hadn't talked to him in a while, something told you to go talk to him again, and somebody he knows in government told him the same thing, so now he's listening.
[01:53:56.760 --> 01:53:57.660]  Yeah, he opened up.
[01:53:58.980 --> 01:54:00.421]  And you say he's going to put them on TV.
[01:54:00.541 --> 01:54:01.001]  Does he have a
[01:54:01.311 --> 01:54:01.891]  TV show?
[01:54:02.452 --> 01:54:03.712]  Yeah, he has a minister show.
[01:54:05.813 --> 01:54:06.914]  Well, that's exciting.
[01:54:07.194 --> 01:54:08.414]  Yeah, that is.
[01:54:08.434 --> 01:54:11.136]  That's really good around here because there hasn't been nothing.
[01:54:11.896 --> 01:54:15.538]  These places I took them to, they just throw them away.
[01:54:15.578 --> 01:54:16.298]  They won't play them.
[01:54:18.439 --> 01:54:19.339]  They won't play nothing.
[01:54:19.860 --> 01:54:22.661]  But, when you first don't succeed, try, try again.
[01:54:22.681 --> 01:54:26.002]  Well, it sounds like he's a prominent pastor if he has a TV show.
[01:54:26.663 --> 01:54:28.403]  Yeah, he's nothing big.
[01:54:28.423 --> 01:54:29.544]  He's just got a little church.
[01:54:30.151 --> 01:54:34.695]  He might have 25 or 30 people, but he's just a wonderful person.
[01:54:34.775 --> 01:54:37.597]  I thought you were saying he was going to put him on a TV show.
[01:54:37.877 --> 01:54:40.919]  Yeah, he's going to put him on a TV show.
[01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:42.000]  He's going to do that.
[01:54:42.841 --> 01:54:53.529]  He told me last time I seen him, I went to three or four of his deals he had this weekend, and we talked quite a bit.
[01:54:53.609 --> 01:54:57.152]  He's got a buddy that's preaching, and the buddy, see,
[01:54:57.705 --> 01:54:58.445]  It's finding out.
[01:54:58.785 --> 01:55:05.147]  Somebody in the government is telling him what's going on, and he comes back and tells him what's going on.
[01:55:05.847 --> 01:55:09.887]  And so, he finally, after about a year, he's opened up.
[01:55:10.968 --> 01:55:12.348]  Well, see, that's how it works.
[01:55:12.408 --> 01:55:27.431]  You know, one person warns you about the New World Order, you don't listen, and then a year later you're watching the news and hear them announce the exact same thing you heard from the guy that warns you a year before, then your neighbor gives you something, and finally you realize, hey, this is really going on.
[01:55:28.669 --> 01:55:36.113]  Yeah, I've hand taped out, I think it's the third year coming up, and I got the power hour, okay?
[01:55:36.533 --> 01:55:40.655]  I got the ones on the shot, I'm giving to the servicemen now.
[01:55:41.756 --> 01:55:42.917]  I'm spreading them out.
[01:55:43.597 --> 01:55:46.218]  I got my daughter running them probably about every day.
[01:55:46.279 --> 01:55:50.781]  I just carry boxes full of empties over there, and she runs them for me.
[01:55:51.101 --> 01:55:56.224]  Well, that's wonderful, and there are thousands of people like yourself listening to this show that are taking action.
[01:55:56.484 --> 01:55:58.105]  There are millions around the country.
[01:55:58.547 --> 01:56:03.350]  Alex, I've been doing, I've been slamming them, I've been slamming them, and I try, I give it a whirl.
[01:56:03.370 --> 01:56:06.472]  I'm the one that called you probably a while back, on the weekend, on the
[01:56:25.954 --> 01:56:29.755]  About the guy who told me 35 years ago it was a Nazi German camp, man.
[01:56:29.775 --> 01:56:32.036]  He just fired me years ago.
[01:56:33.457 --> 01:56:34.197]  Absolutely.
[01:56:34.217 --> 01:56:35.277]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[01:56:35.658 --> 01:56:37.598]  We'll be back to Bob and others and more news.
[01:56:37.618 --> 01:56:38.078]  Stay with us.
[01:56:40.839 --> 01:56:41.740]  We're on the march.
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:43.841]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:56:44.761 --> 01:56:47.462]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:56:53.354 --> 01:56:57.656]  Hi folks, this is Steve Crowley of the national Steve Crowley's American Scene talk radio show.
[01:56:58.016 --> 01:57:00.577]  We are a money talk to be sure, 14 years of success.
[01:57:00.917 --> 01:57:03.058]  We're on every Monday through Friday from 9 a.m.
[01:57:03.098 --> 01:57:03.718]  to 11 a.m.
[01:57:03.838 --> 01:57:04.959]  Eastern and 6 a.m.
[01:57:04.999 --> 01:57:05.639]  to 8 a.m.
[01:57:05.959 --> 01:57:07.720]  Pacific Time, Monday through Friday.
[01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:14.403]  We have big-name guests, the same ones you see on Brewkaiser and CNBC, money-making topics, investors showcase and much more.
[01:57:14.823 --> 01:57:19.285]  Coming up soon on the Genesis Communication Network, it's Steve Crowley's American Scene.
[01:57:20.486 --> 01:57:23.529]  Did you know there's a mixture that stops the aging process?
[01:57:24.109 --> 01:57:26.171]  Stops aging dead in its tracks?
[01:57:26.831 --> 01:57:28.172]  It's called drinking and driving.
[01:57:28.573 --> 01:57:29.574]  A lethal mixture.
[01:57:30.134 --> 01:57:31.415]  No one is immune to it.
[01:57:31.875 --> 01:57:36.780]  Each year, alcohol-related crashes kill more than 16,000 Americans.
[01:57:37.260 --> 01:57:43.285]  So if a friend of yours has been drinking and is about to drive, stop them before they kill someone.
[01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:50.064]  Brought to you in the public interest, and as a public service, by MAD, Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
[01:57:50.565 --> 01:57:53.787]  Hi, this is Jack Brauner with a gold alert from Midas Resources.
[01:57:54.287 --> 01:57:56.308]  Folks, it's time to shed your complacency.
[01:57:56.648 --> 01:57:59.250]  Gold has seldom, if ever, been a better buy.
[01:57:59.610 --> 01:58:04.153]  Midas Resources is now in a position to potentially show you considerable profits.
[01:58:04.374 --> 01:58:06.115]  But you have to act now!
[01:58:06.335 --> 01:58:12.519]  We have $10 collector gold coins at the closest price to melt I have seen in my 24 years in the business.
[01:58:12.919 --> 01:58:19.441]  These are the same coins that are likely to soon command substantial premium prices as they have in the past.
[01:58:19.681 --> 01:58:23.222]  We can deliver them to you now with minimal downside risk.
[01:58:23.462 --> 01:58:26.903]  Or we can let you buy them later at a considerable higher price.
[01:58:27.343 --> 01:58:29.623]  Don't buy them later, folks.
[01:58:29.963 --> 01:58:30.804]  Do it now.
[01:58:31.044 --> 01:58:33.284]  That's $10 collector gold coins.
[01:58:33.664 --> 01:58:40.406]  $10 and $20 collector gold coins at the nearest amount in my 24 years in this business called Midas Resources.
[01:58:49.672 --> 01:58:52.675]  You are sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[01:58:52.835 --> 01:58:58.539]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw food.
[01:58:58.719 --> 01:59:00.080]  You haven't alkalized your body.
[01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:04.243]  In fact, you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[01:59:04.423 --> 01:59:10.227]  You still use either meat, fish, eggs, and or dairy products for your protein instead of spirulina and chlorella.
[01:59:10.751 --> 01:59:12.992]  The two most complete protein superfoods known.
[01:59:13.353 --> 01:59:15.814]  Finally, you don't consume ionized water.
[01:59:16.134 --> 01:59:23.279]  Normal tap water that is transformed into a powerful antioxidant that is very alkaline, balancing your body pH as it brings you to homeostasis.
[01:59:23.579 --> 01:59:27.261]  It's also very hydrating and more importantly, extremely detoxifying.
[01:59:27.541 --> 01:59:30.103]  Good health is achievable when you tune into Achieving Great Health.
[01:59:30.383 --> 01:59:35.326]  If you want to learn more on how to naturally rid the body of any disease, listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley.
[01:59:35.546 --> 01:59:35.906]  I think so.
[01:59:58.650 --> 02:00:11.018]  All right, my friends, let's go to a bunch of calls real quick, your questions, your comments, and let's move on to the next person because I do have a bunch of news I want to hit on, like quarantining dissent, how the Secret Service protects Bush from free speech.
[02:00:11.978 --> 02:00:13.399]  And again, Bill Clinton did the same thing.
[02:00:13.439 --> 02:00:16.761]  It's a horrible trend being set up and totally unconstitutional.
[02:00:17.562 --> 02:00:21.204]  Let's talk to Bill Enmasse, then Bob, Ryan, Kevin, and others.
[02:00:21.804 --> 02:00:23.085]  Bill Enmasse, you're on the air.
[02:00:23.826 --> 02:00:25.507]  You brought up so many
[02:00:26.550 --> 02:00:44.757]  There's a lot of topics in the last hour or two that, uh, so much I'd like to talk about, but really what I'm more curious about is if you'd explain to me what the Muslim or, uh, Arabic culture or terrorists, whatever, are after.
[02:00:44.837 --> 02:00:55.241]  That is, are they after us to punish us for being whatever we are, uh, Judeo-Christian, uh, uh, Confucian, Buddhist, whatever, or are they
[02:00:55.908 --> 02:00:58.589]  Trying to convert us to be like them.
[02:00:59.009 --> 02:01:02.710]  Because if they are, they may very well already have won.
[02:01:03.110 --> 02:01:25.198]  They may already have changed our country, our beloved United States, our revolutionary country, into a model of Iran, or Iraq, or Afghanistan, or Saudi Arabia, or one of those, I won't say damned countries, but man, I tell you, if we start to look like
[02:01:25.874 --> 02:01:29.256]  Those countries from which the terrorists sprout.
[02:01:30.357 --> 02:01:35.261]  What's then the difference if we give up our liberties and become just like them?
[02:01:35.741 --> 02:01:36.702]  Have they not won?
[02:01:36.962 --> 02:01:37.923]  Well, that's a good point.
[02:01:38.043 --> 02:01:43.807]  We're not America anymore if we take on the type of activities these people do.
[02:01:43.847 --> 02:01:55.415]  Now, look, number one, whether it's terror bombings in London or Northern Ireland or terror bombings in Africa or Oklahoma City or in Palestine or any of these places,
[02:01:56.124 --> 02:02:05.830]  Most of the big bombings in the western world, sir, are carried out by intelligence agencies so they can blame it on people as a pretext to set up a police state.
[02:02:06.171 --> 02:02:13.675]  I mean, it just came out again that Vladimir Putin and his own members of his own FSB have exposed it, carried out the bombings there during the 99 election.
[02:02:17.250 --> 02:02:23.614]  Carried out bombings of apartment buildings to have a police state crackdown and then have a popular war against Chechnya.
[02:02:23.655 --> 02:02:28.018]  So a lot of these big events are intelligence agencies doing this.
[02:02:28.078 --> 02:02:30.379]  Now, Arab countries are diverse.
[02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:35.223]  Some are total dictatorships, others are quasi-free.
[02:02:35.843 --> 02:02:41.447]  But by and large, the Arabs will leave us alone if we leave them alone, especially if we stop
[02:02:42.463 --> 02:02:51.845]  buying their oil and funding people like Saudi Arabia who are disgusting and uh... who again if they see you with a cross around your neck will jerk it off and shoot you in the head
[02:02:52.429 --> 02:02:54.830]  I mean, you know, it's horrible over there.
[02:02:54.850 --> 02:02:55.831]  They torture people.
[02:02:56.171 --> 02:02:57.671]  They kill, you know, folks.
[02:02:57.711 --> 02:02:58.752]  They cut their hands off.
[02:02:59.072 --> 02:03:02.654]  You know, all of this, and I hear this pedal is a good way to handle criminals in this country.
[02:03:02.994 --> 02:03:06.395]  No, because you can't trust the government to mete out those type of punishments, folks.
[02:03:06.415 --> 02:03:07.016]  That's the point.
[02:03:07.296 --> 02:03:13.139]  Governments are more dangerous than any other lone criminal, so you restrict them, even if it means a few criminals go free.
[02:03:13.219 --> 02:03:20.322]  Now, when you talk about why do the Arabs, you know, hate us, well, they watch CNN.
[02:03:21.294 --> 02:03:22.455]  And they see all the decadence.
[02:03:22.495 --> 02:03:24.376]  They get MTV on satellite.
[02:03:24.696 --> 02:03:26.617]  They don't want their children growing up like that.
[02:03:27.178 --> 02:03:34.002]  But by and large, most of the Arabs I've talked to don't hate us, and know that it's our corrupt government, not the people.
[02:03:34.242 --> 02:03:36.284]  Because they live under dictatorships, too.
[02:03:36.624 --> 02:03:40.446]  They live under corrupt systems, oligarchies, whatever you want to call it, as well.
[02:03:40.486 --> 02:03:44.849]  And we do have a dictatorship of the military-industrial complex, and so they understand that.
[02:03:45.267 --> 02:03:48.888]  Just like most of the folks in Israel understand that this is all a big scam.
[02:03:49.108 --> 02:03:55.070]  The people of the world aren't bad, it's the corrupt thugs that are in positions of power.
[02:03:55.310 --> 02:03:59.372]  But your point of, you know, killing America to save America is a fraud.
[02:04:00.132 --> 02:04:02.493]  Let me ask you one more question, if I may.
[02:04:03.533 --> 02:04:14.337]  When I was growing up in this country, just after World War II, we learned all kinds of things, awfully good things, and then into the service, so many of us, and we swore to
[02:04:15.818 --> 02:04:20.761]  And now, what have you learned about the FBI there in your state?
[02:04:46.158 --> 02:04:47.118]  It's a damnable thing.
[02:04:51.079 --> 02:04:54.240]  Helping, subsidizing murder.
[02:04:54.460 --> 02:04:55.240]  But never mind that.
[02:04:55.420 --> 02:05:03.141]  How about our military would suspend magnificent young people from the academies for breaking the honor code?
[02:05:03.602 --> 02:05:11.103]  And then a gentleman by the name of Wesley Clark sends Delta Force against the law into Waco?
[02:05:11.523 --> 02:05:15.604]  Or for that matter, the FBI sharpshooters who shot down
[02:05:16.693 --> 02:05:19.275]  Randy Weaver's wife gets battled?
[02:05:19.915 --> 02:05:23.438]  Oh man, there goes the FBI, the baby burners.
[02:05:23.938 --> 02:05:26.039]  The honor system?
[02:05:26.159 --> 02:05:29.341]  Nah, it doesn't exist anymore in the military.
[02:05:30.142 --> 02:05:30.822]  If it ever did.
[02:05:31.023 --> 02:05:32.964]  Bill, thanks for the call, great points.
[02:05:33.864 --> 02:05:43.731]  Folks, every day I scan hundreds of Associated Press, United Press International, Reuters articles, Gannett News Service, Knight Ridder News Service,
[02:05:44.602 --> 02:06:04.278]  And I hear about police murdering people, police stealing drugs, police running the whorehouses, police doing everything you can imagine, FBI running murder for hire and drug dealing in LA and Boston and New York and Houston and the FBI crime lab and all these other big crime labs framing people.
[02:06:04.798 --> 02:06:05.659]  And that's the point!
[02:06:06.690 --> 02:06:16.456]  You restrict the size of government so when it becomes corrupt, which it always does, it doesn't have the power or the machinery to affect us on a mass scale.
[02:06:17.897 --> 02:06:20.959]  You automatically limit tyranny by doing that.
[02:06:21.539 --> 02:06:22.620]  And that's what we're trying to do.
[02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:28.564]  So great points, and I understand the angst in your voice, sir, the anger.
[02:06:29.284 --> 02:06:30.765]  Bob in Pennsylvania, go ahead.
[02:06:31.106 --> 02:06:31.686]  Yes, Alex.
[02:06:32.569 --> 02:06:34.010]  I want to first thank you for everything.
[02:06:34.050 --> 02:06:41.014]  I'm a new listener for about three or four months, and watching your videos has really opened my eyes a lot.
[02:06:43.316 --> 02:06:44.617]  Basically, I want to thank you for that.
[02:06:45.677 --> 02:06:51.641]  I guess, first of all, I know it's hard to... I've had a hard time talking to family, neighbors.
[02:06:51.701 --> 02:06:54.703]  All they want to do is, the Rapture's going to be here before all this happens.
[02:06:55.444 --> 02:06:58.085]  Listen, Matt, was the rapture there in Nazi Germany?
[02:06:58.685 --> 02:07:01.485]  Was the rapture in Communist China when they killed 50 million?
[02:07:01.745 --> 02:07:02.946]  Was it in Soviet Russia?
[02:07:02.986 --> 02:07:05.146]  Was it in Pol Pot's Cambodia?
[02:07:05.586 --> 02:07:07.207]  Was it in Ho Chi Minh's Vietnam?
[02:07:07.247 --> 02:07:08.727]  Was it in Fidel Castro's Cuba?
[02:07:09.007 --> 02:07:11.868]  Was the rapture there for the American Indians when they were slaughtered?
[02:07:12.048 --> 02:07:14.989]  Was the rapture there for all the black slaves brought to this country?
[02:07:15.409 --> 02:07:20.730]  Was the rapture there for the disciples who were almost all killed and tortured to death?
[02:07:21.904 --> 02:07:34.574]  Folks, I believe Christ is coming back, and I'm a Christian, but this cop-out, a lot of people in Nazi Germany, a lot of Christians didn't help the Jews and others because they thought that, oh, God was going to step in.
[02:07:34.795 --> 02:07:36.956]  Well, God commands us to stand up to evil.
[02:07:37.317 --> 02:07:41.941]  That's how God steps in, is by raising up people to stand up against wickedness.
[02:07:44.750 --> 02:07:46.471]  Okay, so I just wanted to touch on that.
[02:07:46.671 --> 02:07:49.033]  I've been having a battle, but I feel bad.
[02:07:49.053 --> 02:07:51.535]  Well, number one, if you talk to a salesman, he'll tell you.
[02:07:52.175 --> 02:07:55.357]  Friends and family are harder to sell to than to somebody you don't know.
[02:07:55.757 --> 02:08:00.981]  Because ego gets involved when it's your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or your grandfather.
[02:08:01.801 --> 02:08:05.163]  You know, oh, you're just little Bob.
[02:08:05.584 --> 02:08:06.704]  Oh, come on, Robert.
[02:08:07.525 --> 02:08:10.087]  They think you're talking down to them, you understand?
[02:08:10.407 --> 02:08:13.469]  And even though they don't listen now, you've planted
[02:08:13.894 --> 02:08:16.595]  That seed, and a seed doesn't sprout overnight.
[02:08:17.656 --> 02:08:18.176]  I understand.
[02:08:18.876 --> 02:08:39.685]  Okay, now I guess to get on to something more serious, well that's serious, I'm sorry, but basically I was getting back to about round 9-1-1, I'm on my way over to, I went over to Russia, I met a fiancé over there, I come back, this was in January of 2001, that I came back,
[02:08:43.464 --> 02:08:49.326]  And I ended up on a plane and got put on a different seat because of my disabilities.
[02:08:49.726 --> 02:08:56.989]  So I was stuck in the back with a fella and I didn't know his name until after 9-1-1 hit.
[02:08:57.029 --> 02:09:05.472]  His name was Ahmed Alnami and he was supposed to be... I was wondering why he was very friendly and talked better than most Americans.
[02:09:05.612 --> 02:09:09.633]  But he's supposed to be one of the ones that went down in the plane in Pennsylvania.
[02:09:11.630 --> 02:09:23.182]  Sir, nine of the 19 hijackers have been confirmed to be alive and the White House and the Pentagon and Homeland Security will not answer questions about it.
[02:09:24.063 --> 02:09:25.004]  It is admitted.
[02:09:25.184 --> 02:09:28.788]  I'm talking Associated Press, BBC, nine
[02:09:29.366 --> 02:09:30.066]  It was seven.
[02:09:30.126 --> 02:09:33.407]  Now it's nine of the nineteen still alive.
[02:09:33.647 --> 02:09:36.408]  They won't tell us why NORAD stood down for an hour and a half.
[02:09:36.668 --> 02:09:39.569]  They won't tell us why public officials were told not to fly.
[02:09:39.829 --> 02:09:43.290]  They won't tell us why a bunch of the supposed hijackers were trained at U.S.
[02:09:43.330 --> 02:09:44.130]  military bases.
[02:09:44.531 --> 02:09:46.671]  We're just supposed to not ask questions about that.
[02:09:47.051 --> 02:09:47.211]  Right.
[02:09:47.251 --> 02:09:58.195]  Well, see, this fella, before we left the airport in Amsterdam, we had to sit on the tarmac for an hour and forty-five minutes before they would allow us to get off until they unloaded all the
[02:10:00.012 --> 02:10:02.954]  Half, three-fourths of the luggage, which didn't make it back to the States.
[02:10:03.875 --> 02:10:15.182]  Basically, I had a... that was coming up to do with the bombing jury that was supposed to... the hearing that was supposed to be coming up then in 2000, early 2001.
[02:10:15.302 --> 02:10:16.563]  Okay, so what happened?
[02:10:17.064 --> 02:10:25.889]  Okay, but anyways, we got back... When we got back, and I saw that on TV, I went to the FBI.
[02:10:25.909 --> 02:10:27.751]  I wanted to be a good citizen.
[02:10:28.906 --> 02:10:30.767]  And basically, they didn't really care.
[02:10:31.008 --> 02:10:36.091]  But now that kind of shows me why.
[02:10:36.291 --> 02:10:38.573]  Because of listening to you and knowing what our government's up to.
[02:10:38.993 --> 02:10:44.778]  So you went to him and said, I was on the plane with one of the supposed hijackers, who the news now admits is still alive.
[02:10:45.198 --> 02:10:46.459]  And what did they say to you?
[02:10:46.759 --> 02:10:49.181]  They said, oh, well, thanks, but why didn't you talk?
[02:10:49.261 --> 02:10:52.243]  If you saw he wouldn't put his coat up, why didn't you say anything?
[02:10:52.263 --> 02:10:56.006]  Well, he didn't seem anything wrong with him to me.
[02:10:56.673 --> 02:11:00.116]  I said, they were just looking for a fellow on the plane for that, with his name.
[02:11:00.576 --> 02:11:07.882]  I said, in this comment, his name's on the pictures on the TV, or TV and then on the Times News.
[02:11:08.182 --> 02:11:12.245]  Well, I guess he put a parachute on and jumped out of the plane on 9-11.
[02:11:12.626 --> 02:11:13.626]  Yeah.
[02:11:13.746 --> 02:11:22.573]  But one other thing that I would, you know, this might help others when they're on the road, was within a week of the 9-1-1 bombing, I was coming back from school.
[02:11:22.593 --> 02:11:24.195]  I live in northwestern Pennsylvania.
[02:11:24.215 --> 02:11:25.255]  I have to travel about 45 miles.
[02:11:26.195 --> 02:11:26.855]  Okay, what happened?
[02:11:26.875 --> 02:11:27.255]  Real quick.
[02:11:27.375 --> 02:11:45.201]  Okay, basically I went to pass this truck and there was a cattle car and it was halfway up the side of the cattle car and halfway back that there was no cattle in there, but there was a hose coming out the side of the car and there was white powder pouring out the side.
[02:11:46.782 --> 02:11:53.324]  And I was wondering, you know, I've been sick since then, but I don't know, they can't find out what's wrong with me.
[02:11:54.045 --> 02:11:55.146]  Sir, I don't know.
[02:11:55.166 --> 02:11:55.766]  I don't know.
[02:11:55.806 --> 02:11:57.547]  I appreciate the call, Bob.
[02:11:58.228 --> 02:12:02.811]  I just know that there's admitted thousands of chemical and biological and radiological tests on us.
[02:12:03.291 --> 02:12:09.275]  Congress admits that that's going on in the air, the sea, in the food, in the subways.
[02:12:09.335 --> 02:12:12.097]  I mean, so I wouldn't put it past them, but I just don't know.
[02:12:13.038 --> 02:12:14.159]  Ryan in Ohio.
[02:12:14.199 --> 02:12:14.759]  You're on the air.
[02:12:14.799 --> 02:12:15.400]  Go ahead, Ryan.
[02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:16.100]  Yeah, a few things.
[02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:17.261]  The first one is about
[02:12:17.950 --> 02:12:27.056]  The old American flag, and I've seen these old movies, the stars are going from the right to the left, and in this last movie I just saw, the stars are going from the left to the right.
[02:12:27.136 --> 02:12:29.898]  Is there a reasoning for the stars being switched going from right to left?
[02:12:29.918 --> 02:12:31.619]  Well, sir, that's probably just the film you saw.
[02:12:31.639 --> 02:12:36.162]  There's lots of different variants in hundreds of companies, thousands of companies making American flags.
[02:12:36.182 --> 02:12:37.162]  Some of them mess it up.
[02:12:38.023 --> 02:12:42.006]  What's changed about the flag in courtrooms and government buildings is the gold fringe.
[02:12:42.366 --> 02:12:43.106]  According to U.S.
[02:12:43.186 --> 02:12:45.748]  code, that means that is a martial law flag.
[02:12:46.664 --> 02:12:48.005]  We have martial law flags now.
[02:12:48.305 --> 02:12:55.009]  Well, we have since 1933 is when we started replacing them, and in 1933 we did go under official martial law.
[02:12:55.449 --> 02:12:56.890]  People say, well, where's the martial law?
[02:12:56.910 --> 02:12:59.711]  Well, it's what increment of tyranny are we in?
[02:12:59.731 --> 02:13:01.772]  It's definitely accelerating.
[02:13:02.072 --> 02:13:09.116]  The second thing is the picture of Saddam's little so-called spider hole he was held in.
[02:13:09.517 --> 02:13:09.817]  Yes.
[02:13:10.117 --> 02:13:13.539]  The fruit on the tree looks like they're ripe, ready to be picked, but
[02:13:16.272 --> 02:13:26.836]  Yeah, that's been all over the news, that there are no dates in that country that even stay on the tree past October.
[02:13:27.696 --> 02:13:40.800]  So if they're grabbing Saddam on December 13th, or they grabbed him on December 12th and now it's December 13th, why are there half-ripe dates bundled there in the tree?
[02:13:42.189 --> 02:13:43.870]  Again, it's just another one of those things.
[02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:45.470]  I mean, it's not like they lied to us.
[02:13:45.830 --> 02:13:47.671]  The Jessica Lynch story was a fable.
[02:13:47.991 --> 02:13:49.552]  They lied about mobile weapons trucks.
[02:13:49.592 --> 02:13:50.972]  They lied about mass graves.
[02:13:51.012 --> 02:13:53.233]  They lied about uranium from Niger.
[02:13:53.993 --> 02:13:55.174]  They lied about all that.
[02:13:55.254 --> 02:13:56.454]  Why would they lie to us again?
[02:13:56.474 --> 02:14:02.856]  And the last thing is, in your movie it says, um, putting chips in the brain by 2025.
[02:14:03.197 --> 02:14:10.039]  So, when I was on one radio station, that was the reason they used you, saying that you're crazy.
[02:14:10.609 --> 02:14:22.639]  But I did find in the article that a General Ronald Fogelman was in charge of doing this Air Force base study that's putting chips in the brain by 2025.
[02:14:22.699 --> 02:14:23.319]  Is that?
[02:14:23.499 --> 02:14:28.563]  Yeah, sir, that's in my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[02:14:29.084 --> 02:14:30.345]  It's in my film.
[02:14:31.146 --> 02:14:33.167]  I should give them that website to go to.
[02:14:33.187 --> 02:14:34.188]  No, they don't care.
[02:14:34.268 --> 02:14:36.530]  You could have the General there in front of them with a
[02:14:37.162 --> 02:15:06.555]  salad dressing on his shoulder with a hundred medals telling him that uh... that was a two thousand report by the army war college and in conjunction with the federation of american scientists and they said uh... that that issue where we would not yeah and it now hold on you say a local radio station was calling me in that case it will actually called up and i was given them all the back and why is this why is that why is oklahoma this
[02:15:07.492 --> 02:15:11.293]  And, uh, that radio station host, he's pretty conservative.
[02:15:11.853 --> 02:15:13.614]  So then he asked me, what did I get from this?
[02:15:13.774 --> 02:15:17.035]  And I mentioned you as some of the sources that I got some of this.
[02:15:17.775 --> 02:15:20.476]  So then they immediately tried to say that you're a nutcase.
[02:15:20.876 --> 02:15:27.658]  And they, what they did was they put in the brain in the, the microchip in the brain is one of the theories.
[02:15:27.698 --> 02:15:30.039]  So I wanted to call back and let the listeners know.
[02:15:30.099 --> 02:15:33.099]  Hey, so obviously, obviously the talk show host knew who I was.
[02:15:33.139 --> 02:15:33.520]  That's good.
[02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:34.280]  He knows the truth.
[02:15:34.720 --> 02:15:34.920]  Yeah.
[02:15:35.762 --> 02:15:37.023]  But he's trying to, like, deny it.
[02:15:37.323 --> 02:15:38.144]  No, I understand.
[02:15:38.564 --> 02:15:40.425]  But how do you deny an official U.S.
[02:15:40.445 --> 02:15:41.206]  government document?
[02:15:41.226 --> 02:15:42.627]  I don't care how crazy it sounds.
[02:15:42.907 --> 02:15:48.210]  You know, I was talking about microchips nine years ago on the air, and now you turn the nightly news on.
[02:15:48.270 --> 02:15:51.893]  It's, oh, you'll soon have a microchip under your skin to buy and sell.
[02:15:52.153 --> 02:15:53.594]  It'll keep all the children safe.
[02:15:53.854 --> 02:15:59.898]  I have Sean Hannity on tape on Hannity and Combs say, quote, every child needs one of these chips now.
[02:16:00.319 --> 02:16:01.199]  Oh, it's so great.
[02:16:01.399 --> 02:16:02.400]  I'm going to buy stock.
[02:16:05.235 --> 02:16:14.963]  Well, we have a clip of Diane Sawyer on one show saying, oh they're so great they have chips, and then Andy Rooney saying everybody should be made to have a chip.
[02:16:15.373 --> 02:16:16.153]  To keep us safe.
[02:16:16.193 --> 02:16:20.935]  But see, I was a kook a year before all that for saying that was the plan.
[02:16:21.256 --> 02:16:23.376]  Then they announce it, and I'm still a kook.
[02:16:23.657 --> 02:16:23.877]  No.
[02:16:24.137 --> 02:16:33.381]  The Army War College and the Federation of American Scientists, in an official 2000 report, said, by 2025, the general public will have chips in their brains.
[02:16:33.401 --> 02:16:38.703]  And they said, we know this sounds crazy, but because of conditioning in the media, people will accept it.
[02:16:38.983 --> 02:16:40.924]  Now that's what the Army said.
[02:16:41.524 --> 02:16:49.952]  And I'm not mad at you, I'm glad you brought it up, but it's very frustrating to me that all I do is cover what they say they're planning to do, and these idiots want to deny it.
[02:16:50.573 --> 02:16:54.176]  Now did this host play a clip of me saying that, or did he just say I said that?
[02:16:54.236 --> 02:16:55.377]  No, he just said that you said it.
[02:16:56.598 --> 02:16:59.161]  And so that's when I looked into the internet to find out about it.
[02:16:59.181 --> 02:17:06.908]  Now that I did find it, I do want to call him back and let the people know which army internet site to go to to see it directly from the General's office.
[02:17:07.697 --> 02:17:13.381]  Yeah, it was on the Federation of American Scientists website and the Army War College website.
[02:17:13.902 --> 02:17:19.085]  And we have links to those somewhere in the hundreds of thousands of links on InfoWars.com.
[02:17:20.046 --> 02:17:21.047]  Alright, that was all I had to say.
[02:17:21.127 --> 02:17:21.847]  Alright, thank you.
[02:17:21.947 --> 02:17:25.430]  And it's in my book, and it's in... Which video is that in?
[02:17:25.470 --> 02:17:29.713]  I think it's in... Is it in Police State 3 Total Enslavement?
[02:17:29.733 --> 02:17:31.034]  I think we have a document in that.
[02:17:31.074 --> 02:17:34.817]  And I mention it while I show news articles in Road to Tyranny.
[02:17:34.897 --> 02:17:36.518]  I can't remember all the stuff that's in my films.
[02:17:36.946 --> 02:17:37.467]  Too long.
[02:17:37.768 --> 02:17:38.609]  They're too jam-packed.
[02:17:39.190 --> 02:17:42.035]  And I haven't even really plugged those yet today, but eh, if you want them, you'll get them.
[02:17:42.136 --> 02:17:42.817]  They're pretty powerful.
[02:17:43.678 --> 02:17:44.199]  Uh, you know what?
[02:17:44.219 --> 02:17:45.161]  We've still got loaded phones.
[02:17:45.181 --> 02:17:48.227]  I'll try to get a couple more, but I want to hit this, uh, quarantining descent, too.
[02:17:50.623 --> 02:17:57.450]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:17:57.771 --> 02:17:59.132]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:17:59.332 --> 02:18:01.535]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:18:01.695 --> 02:18:03.777]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:18:04.057 --> 02:18:09.002]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:18:09.323 --> 02:18:13.367]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:18:13.607 --> 02:18:15.388]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:18:15.468 --> 02:18:26.093]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:18:26.253 --> 02:18:28.134]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:18:28.355 --> 02:18:32.216]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns of the info war.

[02:18:51.170 --> 02:18:55.653]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:18:56.013 --> 02:19:00.097]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:19:00.397 --> 02:19:00.937]  We listened.
[02:19:01.257 --> 02:19:06.241]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:19:06.502 --> 02:19:06.982]  We listened.
[02:19:07.355 --> 02:19:10.396]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:19:10.816 --> 02:19:11.356]  We listened.
[02:19:11.817 --> 02:19:15.878]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:19:16.278 --> 02:19:16.738]  We listened.
[02:19:17.098 --> 02:19:22.340]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:19:22.740 --> 02:19:24.121]  Again, we listened.
[02:19:24.481 --> 02:19:31.863]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.

[02:20:51.032 --> 02:20:56.594]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:20:57.922 --> 02:21:02.585]  Alright folks, we've only got time to go to Kevin and Robert because I want to hit this final news story.
[02:21:02.625 --> 02:21:07.628]  There's a lot of other important stuff at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:21:07.868 --> 02:21:15.353]  Quarantining, I'm in trouble with that word today, quarantining dissent, how the Secret Service protects Bush from free speech.
[02:21:15.393 --> 02:21:16.874]  And again, Bill Clinton did this too.
[02:21:17.814 --> 02:21:23.338]  And let me ask conservatives, do you want to be quarantined when it comes time for you to protest Howard Dean?
[02:21:23.898 --> 02:21:26.820]  When President Bush travels around the United States, the Secret Service
[02:21:27.233 --> 02:21:31.735]  When Bush went to the Pittsburgh area Labor Day 2002, 65-year-old retired steel worker Bill Neal was there to greet him with a sign proclaiming
[02:21:56.667 --> 02:22:00.690]  The Bush family must surely love the poor they made so many of us.
[02:22:01.591 --> 02:22:13.500]  The local police at the Secret Service behest set up a designated free speech zone on a baseball field surrounded by a chain-link fence a third of a mile from the location of Bush's speech.
[02:22:14.140 --> 02:22:22.007]  The police cleared the path of the motorcade of all critical signs, but folks with pro-Bush signs were permitted to line the President's path.
[02:22:22.047 --> 02:22:26.490]  Neal refused to go to the designated area and was arrested for disorderly conduct
[02:22:26.769 --> 02:22:28.751]  The police also confiscated his sign.
[02:22:29.251 --> 02:22:33.534]  Neal later commented, as far as I'm concerned, the whole country is a free speech zone.
[02:22:33.815 --> 02:22:38.618]  If the Bush administration has its way, anyone who criticizes them will be out of sight and out of mind.
[02:22:39.459 --> 02:22:42.622]  Bill Clinton did the same stuff, but now it's been institutionalized.
[02:22:43.342 --> 02:22:47.906]  And they'll take you a mile away, a half mile away, in one case that I know of, ten miles away,
[02:22:48.342 --> 02:22:52.405]  To some desolate park, and they'll say, this is where you're supposed to protest.
[02:22:52.685 --> 02:22:54.326]  There's no media, no nothing.
[02:22:54.927 --> 02:22:58.490]  America is about being able to line the road and yell at the leader.
[02:22:58.990 --> 02:22:59.871]  Yell at the governor.
[02:23:00.111 --> 02:23:00.911]  Yell at the mayor.
[02:23:01.412 --> 02:23:04.654]  This is so un-American.
[02:23:04.734 --> 02:23:07.256]  And I hear neocons on the radio defending this!
[02:23:07.736 --> 02:23:15.322]  I'm sick of you, you gun-grabbing, open-border-promoting, communist-Chinese-loving socialists!
[02:23:15.342 --> 02:23:16.623]  You're not conservatives!
[02:23:17.369 --> 02:23:18.670]  Kevin in Boston, go ahead.
[02:23:19.511 --> 02:23:20.391]  Happy New Year, Alex.
[02:23:20.652 --> 02:23:20.952]  Welcome.
[02:23:21.412 --> 02:23:22.153]  Thank you.
[02:23:23.414 --> 02:23:29.218]  I just had some of the response to your request for top events for 2003 to start.
[02:23:30.019 --> 02:23:32.081]  First event has to be the preemptive war.
[02:23:32.101 --> 02:23:33.582]  I mean, we used to call that an invasion.
[02:23:33.602 --> 02:23:41.748]  That could be competing for number one, maybe again with the elite terror sponsors using the Columbia disaster.
[02:23:41.768 --> 02:23:43.730]  There's a distraction from that war.
[02:23:44.931 --> 02:23:46.552]  Second event, I got two
[02:23:46.940 --> 02:23:47.580]  Who to compare?
[02:23:47.600 --> 02:23:48.701]  You can kind of pick which one you like.
[02:23:49.041 --> 02:23:58.565]  The Dr. Kelly's assassination by Tony Blair, or with the recent Patriot Act 2 being passed quietly, taking more of our rights away.
[02:23:59.085 --> 02:24:09.989]  For number three, competition between the dollar losing 17% of its value this year, that's on top of a 24% of its value versus the euro last year, for a total of 41%.
[02:24:10.049 --> 02:24:14.311]  So if you haven't received a pay raise in the past couple of years,
[02:24:15.161 --> 02:24:17.523]  Basically, you received a 41% pay cut.
[02:24:17.683 --> 02:24:26.610]  That could be competed, or maybe you'd say the top stories, the Dow Jones stocks have improved, and they've gone up 7% measured in those dollars that are down 17%.
[02:24:27.010 --> 02:24:31.293]  So you're netting your stocks down 10%.
[02:24:31.854 --> 02:24:41.361]  But for prediction, looking up, I think many more Americans are going to wake up and start listening to shows like your own here, and they're going to stop looking to politicians to
[02:24:41.949 --> 02:24:45.491]  Save them and look more to themselves, because they can do a lot more than they think they can.
[02:24:45.551 --> 02:24:46.651]  So that's an upbeat note.
[02:24:47.852 --> 02:24:48.552]  Awesome call.
[02:24:48.572 --> 02:24:49.293]  Call me back again.
[02:24:49.353 --> 02:24:50.633]  I'm sorry we're so short on time.
[02:24:50.733 --> 02:24:52.294]  Robert in Illinois, you've got 50 seconds.
[02:24:52.334 --> 02:24:52.734]  Go ahead.
[02:24:53.295 --> 02:24:54.695]  Alex, Robert, call for Chicago.
[02:24:54.755 --> 02:24:55.496]  Three quick things.
[02:24:55.776 --> 02:24:59.357]  The attorney down in the Chavo case is trying to murder Teresa Chavo.
[02:24:59.377 --> 02:25:01.258]  His number is George Felis.
[02:25:01.278 --> 02:25:01.639]  727-7364.
[02:25:02.459 --> 02:25:03.039]  Okay, sir.
[02:25:03.079 --> 02:25:04.980]  I've got to check that out and have him on as guest.
[02:25:05.020 --> 02:25:06.561]  I don't want to just fire phone numbers out.
[02:25:06.946 --> 02:25:07.807]  What else is on your mind?
[02:25:25.865 --> 02:25:35.690]  This nominal Christian idea that Christ just rolled over and died, and a non-counterfeit Christian just rolls over and dies, and watch this tyranny and this myth.
[02:25:35.710 --> 02:25:36.230]  We're out of time.
[02:25:36.250 --> 02:25:36.910]  Great call.
[02:25:36.930 --> 02:25:38.171]  See you back tomorrow, back tonight.
[02:25:38.191 --> 02:25:38.631]  God bless.
[02:25:41.227 --> 02:25:51.955]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:25:52.155 --> 02:25:59.681]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:25:59.961 --> 02:26:00.742]  We're good to go!
[02:26:15.922 --> 02:26:19.825]  The Berkey Light is transparent so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:26:19.865 --> 02:26:21.767]  The water level is always visible.
[02:26:21.947 --> 02:26:27.872]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:26:28.132 --> 02:26:32.075]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:26:32.095 --> 02:26:32.676]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
