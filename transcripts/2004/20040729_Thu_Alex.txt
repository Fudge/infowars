[00:00:05.675 --> 00:00:09.858]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.518 --> 00:00:11.338]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:12.979]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.382]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.842 --> 00:00:21.965]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:33.312]  Alright, my friends, we are now into hour number one
[00:00:35.473 --> 00:00:43.578]  Of this Thursday, the 29th of July, 2004, live edition, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:43.618 --> 00:00:44.958]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:50.742]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[00:00:50.782 --> 00:00:51.802]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[00:00:53.543 --> 00:01:02.068]  Wide open phones today, and as usual, and extra helping, by the way, of vital news and information.
[00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:03.589]  GIs!
[00:01:04.338 --> 00:01:07.221]  Pushing Iraqis into river was ordered!
[00:01:08.582 --> 00:01:15.248]  Now they've tried to claim it was malaria medicine, makes the troops run over people's cars for no reason and kill and rape and slaughter.
[00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:24.056]  But no, it's grounding people under orders, just randomly find some young people and just ground them for fun because it's all part of the freedom.
[00:01:25.598 --> 00:01:29.822]  You know, I support the troops, I support the military, we've always had the best military in the world.
[00:01:31.088 --> 00:01:36.013]  Doles out the least amount of abuse compared to other militaries, but we cannot sit here and put up with this.
[00:01:37.774 --> 00:01:38.855]  So we'll go over that.
[00:01:39.796 --> 00:01:49.524]  Also, potential terrorists released due to lack of jail space, Congressman says, and we got a call about this yesterday and they did send us the article.
[00:01:49.604 --> 00:01:51.145]  It is posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:01:53.664 --> 00:02:01.507]  Middle Easterners with possible terrorist ties have been detained after entering the country from Mexico, but released for lack of jail space.
[00:02:01.547 --> 00:02:04.268]  They're illegal aliens, but they just release them, said U.S.
[00:02:04.308 --> 00:02:13.511]  Representative Solomon P. Ortiz, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness.
[00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:15.751]  And he told the Brownsville Herald that.
[00:02:16.752 --> 00:02:17.332]  We'll cover it.
[00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:22.508]  Well, you saw 160 of the Mexican judicial workers get the chip.
[00:02:22.548 --> 00:02:23.849]  They have to have it to go to work.
[00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.290]  Now they want to make the police take it.
[00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.991]  You knew this was coming from CNET News.
[00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:30.933]  Under the skin, ID chips move towards U.S.
[00:02:31.833 --> 00:02:32.553]  hospitals.
[00:02:34.895 --> 00:02:35.375]  That's right.
[00:02:35.415 --> 00:02:38.216]  You want to come in our hospital, you've got to take the chip.
[00:02:38.256 --> 00:02:41.518]  There's absolutely no reason for it, but the chip, you've got to take the chip.
[00:02:43.055 --> 00:02:44.736]  Another article here out of the Register.
[00:02:44.856 --> 00:02:47.418]  Outbreak of RFID tagging at medical facilities.
[00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:48.739]  They're moving ahead with that as well.
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.461]  Just some of the news.
[00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:55.204]  Here's another one out of New Scientist, the current issue.
[00:02:56.225 --> 00:03:00.007]  Fighter pilots could command drone swarms.
[00:03:00.307 --> 00:03:03.750]  Drone swarms.
[00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.673]  And also, I want to get into Kerry and his fake war video.
[00:03:09.474 --> 00:03:11.996]  And Bill Clinton saying he wants our guns and
[00:03:12.748 --> 00:03:14.709]  Well, then I guess Bush will have to save us, won't he?
[00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:16.089]  There's a problem.
[00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:22.391]  Capitol Hill Blue reporting, Bush using drugs to control depression, erratic behavior.
[00:03:24.032 --> 00:03:27.493]  Now, I have to tell you, everything I've ever seen from Capitol Hill Blue turns out to be factual.
[00:03:27.573 --> 00:03:29.134]  I mean, they expose Bill Clinton greatly.
[00:03:30.554 --> 00:03:33.735]  And Bush using drugs to control depression, erratic behavior.
[00:03:33.775 --> 00:03:36.336]  And I have this from White House sources long before it was in the news.
[00:03:39.111 --> 00:03:42.213]  Yeah, he's always been a drug addict.
[00:03:42.693 --> 00:03:46.335]  Oil prices at 21-year record as fears grow.
[00:03:47.256 --> 00:03:49.217]  Saddam could die before his trial.
[00:03:49.517 --> 00:03:50.717]  Oh, how convenient!
[00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:55.960]  Florida election officials oppose elections audit.
[00:03:56.441 --> 00:04:01.904]  They say any type of record of how you vote and any type of audit is wrong and that we shouldn't ask for that.
[00:04:01.984 --> 00:04:02.644]  That's right.
[00:04:03.545 --> 00:04:07.707]  They just did their major test yesterday of the Florida electronic touchscreens and they failed
[00:04:08.462 --> 00:04:14.268]  But that's alright, they're designed to fail and give you magic numbers, so we'll cover that out of the Associated Press.
[00:04:17.751 --> 00:04:19.693]  And that's just some of what's coming.
[00:04:19.733 --> 00:04:27.240]  I haven't even skimmed the surface of the information we'll be detailing here in the next two hours and fifty-five minutes.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.502]  Toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:34.443 --> 00:04:38.186]  Went down to the City Council telecommunications meeting yesterday here in Austin.
[00:04:38.206 --> 00:04:44.730]  I want to thank the hundreds of people that came out for showing up on such short notice and it was quite a circus!
[00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:52.595]  We'll talk about that three ring circus when we get back as well.
[00:04:53.215 --> 00:04:55.557]  This affects everyone's free speech nationwide.
[00:04:56.417 --> 00:04:56.958]  Stay with us.
[00:05:03.627 --> 00:05:09.112]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.533 --> 00:05:13.757]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:13.997 --> 00:05:21.024]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.424 --> 00:05:27.530]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:28.871]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.211 --> 00:05:32.175]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:05:32.315 --> 00:05:34.337]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:05:34.658 --> 00:05:41.886]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:05:42.187 --> 00:05:45.591]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:05:45.991 --> 00:05:50.657]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time that's 866-885-6625 call today!
[00:06:01.124 --> 00:06:09.752]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:06:09.972 --> 00:06:21.202]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:21.462 --> 00:06:24.104]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:24.444 --> 00:06:30.909]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:32.951]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:06:33.131 --> 00:06:39.156]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:39.416 --> 00:06:45.040]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.202]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:53.044]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:11.857 --> 00:07:14.459]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:17.460]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:07:17.621 --> 00:07:21.843]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:21.903 --> 00:07:28.848]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:28.968 --> 00:07:30.989]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:41.777]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:07:41.977 --> 00:07:47.341]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:07:47.862 --> 00:07:51.625]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:07:52.005 --> 00:07:53.526]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:08:05.709 --> 00:08:09.892]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:11.413]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.113 --> 00:08:12.994]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.014 --> 00:08:17.637]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.857 --> 00:08:22.020]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:27.143 --> 00:08:33.027]  Watching snippets of the Democratic National Stage-Managed Theater
[00:08:34.364 --> 00:08:37.446]  Reminds me of why I hate the Democrats.
[00:08:39.007 --> 00:08:43.211]  And of course, watching the Republicans will remind me of why I can't stand them either.
[00:08:45.212 --> 00:08:46.653]  These are a bunch of elitists.
[00:08:46.793 --> 00:08:49.995]  They sit up there, they lie, they spin, they manipulate.
[00:08:50.636 --> 00:08:53.038]  Edwards, pretty boy of the Mildenberg Group.
[00:08:53.278 --> 00:08:55.279]  Openly, the Mildenberg Group says he's the VP.
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.902]  Internationalist, appointing our VP candidates.
[00:08:59.903 --> 00:09:01.524]  Tells us they're the party of hope.
[00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:03.531]  They agree with the war.
[00:09:03.591 --> 00:09:05.013]  They agree with the open borders.
[00:09:05.093 --> 00:09:07.875]  They agree with the Patriot Act.
[00:09:08.776 --> 00:09:14.882]  They agree with a giant domestic CIA running our lives.
[00:09:16.003 --> 00:09:17.564]  But oh, they're the party of hope.
[00:09:17.624 --> 00:09:22.829]  No, you're the party of nightmare and darkness and dependency to the corporations that you work for.
[00:09:24.582 --> 00:09:25.883]  So I do want to talk about that.
[00:09:25.923 --> 00:09:31.845]  I mean, I put the call out yesterday and we loaded the phones the whole broadcast, of course, but no one really wanted to talk about the convention.
[00:09:32.186 --> 00:09:37.288]  Did you see Bill Clinton on Monday say that, why are we taking the cops off the street but giving the people guns?
[00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:41.782]  By the way, Bush is not taking police off the streets.
[00:09:42.203 --> 00:10:02.554]  We've gone from 300 and something thousand under Clinton, to now upwards of 700,000, and Bush is shifting money from the COPS program that Clinton says will take 88,000 off the street, and he's shifting it to Homeland Security funding, so instead of just being gun-grabbing police funded to do that locally, they're going to be Homeland Security federal police, even worse!
[00:10:03.075 --> 00:10:06.797]  So don't worry, you're going to be lots more swarming police everywhere.
[00:10:08.154 --> 00:10:09.895]  That we do not need more of, by the way.
[00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:13.018]  I take that back.
[00:10:13.038 --> 00:10:16.561]  I mean, the cities have got far too many, and you go out in the country and you can't find a cop.
[00:10:17.141 --> 00:10:20.343]  Or it's some multi-jurisdictional task force too busy doing drug raids.
[00:10:20.824 --> 00:10:25.788]  You know, after looking at whose ranch is worth more money, hopefully they'll find some drugs so they can move into the ranch.
[00:10:26.488 --> 00:10:27.629]  They actually have that happening.
[00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:30.932]  But we'll discuss it also.
[00:10:30.992 --> 00:10:32.693]  Just a ton of news here.
[00:10:32.853 --> 00:10:36.416]  Microchips, troops being ordered to drowned Iraqis, just...
[00:10:37.567 --> 00:10:57.593]  On and on and on, but I aired this about a month or so ago, hadn't aired it in about six months before that, and people keep requesting it, so I won't do this for a few more months, but here it is, folks, and this is to all the renegades out there standing up for free speech, standing up for the Second Amendment, standing up for the Fourth Amendment, standing up for national sovereignty.
[00:10:58.701 --> 00:11:16.330]  And for the hundreds, I don't know, it was over a hundred people in the chairs and dozens and dozens outside and just jamming the whole place, over a hundred people on short notice showed up to the city council building for the telecommunications meeting to try to stand up against the shutdown of free speech in Austin, Texas.
[00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:24.814]  And so for all of you that showed up to the meeting and spoke so eloquently, and for all of you around the country standing up for free speech, this song's for you.
[00:11:38.426 --> 00:11:48.429]  From Nazareth he came with a ragtag band to bring a revolution.
[00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:56.191]  Some would make him king, others couldn't stand that.
[00:11:57.532 --> 00:12:03.674]  The cross was a solution, but he rose again.
[00:12:05.547 --> 00:12:22.501]  Wise men follow him where the roads give Wise men follow him, thank God for the many deeds And the life indeed for the heroes
[00:12:26.744 --> 00:12:32.209]  Without the Renegades, Lord knows where we'd be.
[00:12:32.369 --> 00:12:47.582]  When it comes to heroes, Renegades are mine.
[00:12:48.963 --> 00:12:54.048]  They railed against the crown, with another ragtag band.
[00:12:55.818 --> 00:13:20.877]  Declaring independence They laid their bodies down On a bloody wall And liberty for their descendants Thanks to the renegades We're free today Thanks to the renegades
[00:13:22.766 --> 00:13:24.447]  I'm afraid today.
[00:13:24.667 --> 00:13:26.788]  Thank God for the renegades.
[00:13:27.188 --> 00:13:36.153]  And the light they lead far ahead of their time.
[00:13:36.213 --> 00:13:43.756]  Without the renegades, Lord knows where we'd be.
[00:13:43.876 --> 00:13:49.019]  When it comes to heroes, renegades are fine.
[00:14:10.584 --> 00:14:12.706]  Where are the Renegades?
[00:14:14.488 --> 00:14:18.251]  In the world today Who are the Renegades?
[00:14:18.371 --> 00:14:24.857]  In the world today Hang out for the Renegades!
[00:14:31.449 --> 00:14:39.177]  When it comes to heroes, Renegades are mine.
[00:15:10.552 --> 00:15:13.394]  All right, my friends, it is the 29th day of July, 2004.
[00:15:13.755 --> 00:15:15.996]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:15:16.457 --> 00:15:21.921]  As I said, wide open phones today on the broadcast at 800-259-9231.
[00:15:23.322 --> 00:15:25.664]  Where are the renegades in the world today?
[00:15:25.784 --> 00:15:28.567]  Who are the renegades in the world today?
[00:15:29.047 --> 00:15:33.130]  They laid their bodies down for liberty for their descendants.
[00:15:34.411 --> 00:15:40.256]  And if you don't feel a blood debt, and if you don't feel those oaths
[00:15:40.916 --> 00:15:47.541]  Coming back at you, screaming back at you, whispering back at you from the midst of time against tyranny.
[00:15:48.882 --> 00:15:51.124]  No matter what corner of the world you come from.
[00:15:52.945 --> 00:15:58.849]  All of us, the commoners, the common man, the common woman, the common person, against tyranny and despotism.
[00:15:58.889 --> 00:16:07.536]  If you don't know that it's upon us again, if your guts, if your marrow of the bones don't tell you this, then you're
[00:16:08.573 --> 00:16:09.294]  You're blind.
[00:16:09.374 --> 00:16:10.955]  Something's wrong with you.
[00:16:14.338 --> 00:16:20.263]  You know, our troops have been told to be as abusive and vicious as possible in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:16:21.244 --> 00:16:25.067]  And the military planners know that this will cause rebellion.
[00:16:25.728 --> 00:16:27.749]  And they want rebellion.
[00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:32.734]  That's why they've hired former torture lords
[00:16:35.225 --> 00:16:44.209]  From Latin America and Vietnam who carried these actions out to go there and to be the masters of this system.
[00:16:47.251 --> 00:17:02.158]  And it's so sad to see this happening and remember the story of the troops pushing young men, teenagers into water because they didn't show respect and watching as one drowned in the river.
[00:17:03.453 --> 00:17:06.055]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:17:06.836 --> 00:17:09.778]  G.I.s, pushing Iraqis in a river was ordered.
[00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:18.706]  One of the four soldiers charged with pushing two Iraqi civilians into a river where one of them drowned since he was ordered to do so and told what to say to officials looking into the death.
[00:17:18.826 --> 00:17:21.148]  An Army investigator testified Wednesday.
[00:17:22.649 --> 00:17:29.115]  Specialist Terry Bowman said he was told by a chain of command what version to give investigators.
[00:17:29.735 --> 00:17:30.556]  Sergeant Ernie
[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:42.286]  Centron of the Army's Criminal Investigation Command and during a teleconference from Iraq so the military convened a hearing to determine whether the soldiers will be court-martialed.
[00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:45.368]  And it continues.
[00:17:46.188 --> 00:17:49.690]  Bowman said he was ordered to push the man into the Tiger Shoe Freight East.
[00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:53.872]  Centron said it was not disclosed who gave the order.
[00:17:53.972 --> 00:17:59.475]  Three of the soldiers, commanders, have received non-judicial punishments for their roles in the incident.
[00:17:59.515 --> 00:18:00.596]  Well, that's pretty convincing.
[00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:03.391]  None of those punishments includes jail time.
[00:18:04.291 --> 00:18:05.392]  And then it goes into all of it.
[00:18:08.274 --> 00:18:25.307]  Folks, we've played the audio here, we have a video of them on the website from PBS where they think they've stolen three sticks of wood, they bulldoze with the tank, the car, and laugh at it after they machine gun the vehicle.
[00:18:26.013 --> 00:18:27.694]  I mean, what on earth is the point of that?
[00:18:28.114 --> 00:18:31.315]  They go into homes and towns and arrest all the men down to age 11.
[00:18:32.835 --> 00:18:41.037]  They run over their date palms, they run over their tangerine plantations, that people are on subsistence for thousands of years, living off of that.
[00:18:41.598 --> 00:18:44.118]  Women sit down in the dirt and say, now I wait to die.
[00:18:45.539 --> 00:18:46.799]  It is a hellhole.
[00:18:47.679 --> 00:18:52.581]  Our government has appointed torture masters, killers, bombers, CIA officers,
[00:18:53.467 --> 00:18:56.508]  To run the country, and they call this an elected government.
[00:18:56.568 --> 00:18:58.208]  I mean, it is a joke, people!
[00:19:00.529 --> 00:19:02.209]  Now, do I support Saddam Hussein?
[00:19:02.449 --> 00:19:03.970]  Absolutely not!
[00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:20.694]  I do not support our government training him as an assassin, putting him in, telling him to attack Iran, telling him to invade Kuwait, and then not taking him out of power in 1991, when they could have done it, then letting him sit there, have sanctions that kill over a million and a half Iraqis, 700,000 of them children,
[00:19:23.166 --> 00:19:28.127]  In the next 12 plus years, then going in and putting most of the Ba'athists back in power.
[00:19:28.407 --> 00:19:30.468]  Now that's just the facts, folks.
[00:19:35.509 --> 00:19:37.370]  And now they're saying we're going to be there 10 years?
[00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:40.091]  And they've got their draft lined up for us?
[00:19:41.591 --> 00:19:45.052]  When we get back, potential terrorists released due to lack of jail space.
[00:19:45.152 --> 00:19:47.813]  Brownsville Herald, a bunch of other news.

[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.140]  Terrorism!
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.061]  Terrorism!
[00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:09.223]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:20:09.483 --> 00:20:11.084]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:20:11.324 --> 00:20:13.785]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:20:14.185 --> 00:20:28.751]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:20:28.791 --> 00:20:29.111]  government.

[00:20:31.452 --> 00:20:37.377]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:20:37.517 --> 00:20:41.980]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:05.294]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[00:22:05.534 --> 00:22:08.977]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[00:22:09.197 --> 00:22:11.659]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:20.507]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[00:22:20.867 --> 00:22:26.632]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[00:22:26.912 --> 00:22:28.853]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[00:22:29.093 --> 00:22:36.035]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.
[00:22:36.375 --> 00:22:42.837]  Midas Resources is pleased to offer a subscription to the International Forecaster newsletter free of charge with a qualifying order.
[00:22:43.098 --> 00:22:50.420]  That's right, for a limited time, Midas Resources is offering a one-year subscription to Bob Chapman's powerful newsletter, the International Forecaster.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:55.128]  Call 800-686-2237 for more information or to place your order.
[00:22:55.248 --> 00:22:55.468]  That's 800-686-2237.

[00:23:01.036 --> 00:23:03.337]  My family's breathing easier and now you can too!
[00:23:03.517 --> 00:23:06.878]  Hey folks, Michael Trudell here to tell you about the Biozone Air Purifier.
[00:23:06.978 --> 00:23:09.179]  The Biozone Air Purifier is not a filter system.
[00:23:09.359 --> 00:23:15.342]  It works at the molecular level, binding the small bits of dust, allergens, and other particles in your air into clumps that are too heavy to float.
[00:23:15.522 --> 00:23:18.103]  They fall harmlessly to the floor to be literally swept away.
[00:23:18.363 --> 00:23:19.023]  Nothing escapes!
[00:23:19.143 --> 00:23:23.365]  The Biozone Air Purifier also kills virus and bacteria germs and totally removes odors.
[00:23:23.545 --> 00:23:27.166]  Out on the farm we have several cats and two big dogs, so pet odors can be a concern.
[00:23:27.266 --> 00:23:29.507]  But like the odors from anything else, simply gone!
[00:23:29.767 --> 00:23:30.067]  Smoke?
[00:23:30.307 --> 00:23:32.189]  My wife and I don't, but several of our friends do.
[00:23:32.349 --> 00:23:35.411]  Our Biozone Air Purifier clears out that smoke literally within minutes.
[00:23:35.631 --> 00:23:39.754]  I use it myself, and I'm telling you, your Biozone Air Purifier will improve the air in your home.
[00:23:39.894 --> 00:23:42.556]  It even comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee and free shipping.
[00:23:42.736 --> 00:23:45.518]  Call toll-free, 888-88-MY-AIR today.
[00:23:45.618 --> 00:23:47.959]  That's 1-888-88-MY-AIR.

[00:24:11.684 --> 00:24:16.527]  Alright, my friends, we're back live and we're going to go to your calls now and then we'll get in tune.
[00:24:17.528 --> 00:24:19.749]  Under the skin, ID chips move towards U.S.
[00:24:19.809 --> 00:24:20.370]  hospitals.
[00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:23.031]  See, it's materializing in every facet of our lives.
[00:24:23.632 --> 00:24:25.553]  Also, RFID tagging in the hospitals.
[00:24:25.633 --> 00:24:28.074]  Fighter pilots could command drone swarms.
[00:24:29.035 --> 00:24:33.958]  John Kerry and his fake war footage in a staged event.
[00:24:35.727 --> 00:24:39.688]  Bush using drugs to control depression, erratic behavior, it's all coming up.
[00:24:40.428 --> 00:24:42.609]  Right now, let's go to Elizabeth in Texas.
[00:24:42.749 --> 00:24:44.050]  Elizabeth, you're on the air.
[00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:44.470]  Welcome.
[00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:46.150]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:24:46.890 --> 00:25:00.434]  I listened to a rebroadcast last night here in Texas of your show, and I listened with anguish because I'm a professional musician for the last 34 years, and having worked here near the Austin area since 1984,
[00:25:03.627 --> 00:25:27.477]  I have been intimately familiar with the people of ACTV, and I was on the Texas Music Commission for a while, the Board of Directors, and was instrumental in helping raise the criteria for broadcast on the public access channels, along with Hank Sinatra and some of the groundbreakers for the Austin live music on air scene.
[00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:29.911]  Anyway, I think it's like a lot of other things.
[00:25:30.171 --> 00:25:36.334]  People are so accustomed to what we have here, they don't realize what a gift it is anymore.
[00:25:36.394 --> 00:25:43.436]  And since I wasn't able to go down and give a speech, hearing about this too late last night, I will say this to your listeners.
[00:25:44.077 --> 00:25:53.961]  What's happening with Austin Access, and you haven't given the report yet this morning, which I'm awaiting hearing, is indicative of a problem that's endemic
[00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:58.472]  To our nation and our world.
[00:25:58.593 --> 00:26:02.615]  For those that just joined us, they just shut down AXS TV in Houston two weeks ago.
[00:26:02.635 --> 00:26:11.741]  They're shutting it down all over the country, and they're trying it here in Austin with this real slick packaging, but we really exposed it yesterday.
[00:26:12.301 --> 00:26:17.525]  Well, it's a loss of another voice of truth, one of the few precious few
[00:26:18.268 --> 00:26:22.951]  It's one of the places where not only did my faith become increased,
[00:26:45.632 --> 00:26:48.054]  Do the programming on that channel.
[00:26:48.094 --> 00:26:48.955]  But I heard about you.
[00:26:49.215 --> 00:26:52.938]  I learned of you in 1998 for the first time.
[00:26:53.579 --> 00:27:00.325]  Had that not been available to us, my political views might not have been provoked.
[00:27:00.585 --> 00:27:02.606]  My theology might not have been provoked.
[00:27:02.927 --> 00:27:09.032]  And I certainly would not have the appreciation for the creativity and the radical thinking that
[00:27:09.716 --> 00:27:23.882]  It's available in this area and the people who are in the larger cities, the more progressive cities, I hate to even use that word, have something comparable to this and can lose it as quickly as we appear to be losing our access.
[00:27:24.623 --> 00:27:27.384]  And so this is a warning in our comfort.
[00:27:27.464 --> 00:27:29.665]  We cannot be static.
[00:27:29.725 --> 00:27:36.348]  We cannot just sit there and presume that all of these resources will be available to us infinitely.
[00:27:36.408 --> 00:27:37.088]  They're not.
[00:27:37.188 --> 00:27:38.108]  They're being taken away.
[00:27:38.128 --> 00:27:38.709]  It's just another
[00:27:42.903 --> 00:27:46.766]  It's just like talk radio being consolidated, Elizabeth, in your eloquent words.
[00:27:46.806 --> 00:27:47.667]  And thank you for the call.
[00:27:48.848 --> 00:27:51.310]  And I will give a short report on what happened yesterday.
[00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:55.313]  It was something else there at the City Council meeting.
[00:27:55.994 --> 00:27:57.215]  Peter, in New Jersey.
[00:27:57.275 --> 00:27:58.036]  Peter, you're on the air.
[00:27:58.116 --> 00:27:58.676]  Thanks for holding.
[00:27:58.716 --> 00:27:59.076]  Go ahead.
[00:27:59.477 --> 00:27:59.677]  Yes.
[00:28:00.037 --> 00:28:00.878]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[00:28:00.898 --> 00:28:02.099]  Welcome.
[00:28:02.159 --> 00:28:07.724]  First-time caller, good friend of mine, Ron, from New York, calls you often and recently has put me in touch with
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.082]  Things that you're informing everybody about.
[00:28:11.202 --> 00:28:13.223]  I heard you a few months ago on Coast to Coast.
[00:28:13.944 --> 00:28:14.964]  Absolutely tremendous.
[00:28:15.945 --> 00:28:37.559]  Being a born-again Christian of almost 25 years now, I came up in the understanding of apple pie, baseball, America, so forth and so on, only to find out now through your tremendous knowledge of things, inputting it to us, of what's going on here and who's who and who's not,
[00:28:38.576 --> 00:29:00.981]  And not only is it freaking me out as a believer in Christ, but what does one do, being a national election coming up three months from now, of this freak show in Boston, and this current administration in Washington, you want to exercise your right to vote, and who in the world, A, do you vote for?
[00:29:01.061 --> 00:29:02.222]  Do you even vote?
[00:29:02.542 --> 00:29:03.822]  Does your vote even count?
[00:29:04.454 --> 00:29:13.200]  The Freak Show up in Boston, are they going to be getting in from the globalist community just like the ones in Washington four years ago?
[00:29:14.681 --> 00:29:17.724]  And the backup question to that, Alex, would be this.
[00:29:19.125 --> 00:29:31.754]  Being a listener to Christian radio over the number of years, such as the Robertsons, the Charles Stanley, people like that, the very big high echelon of Christian radio
[00:29:32.435 --> 00:29:37.800]  They're not even touching subjects like this, including things like Bohemian Grove.
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:39.321]  So where does one go?
[00:29:39.361 --> 00:29:43.225]  Does one put you on and listen to you for that information?
[00:29:43.485 --> 00:29:44.205]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[00:29:44.426 --> 00:29:47.508]  Two incredibly vital, complex questions.
[00:29:47.528 --> 00:29:48.289]  Thanks for the call.
[00:29:48.309 --> 00:29:49.830]  I'll try to answer them when we get back.
[00:29:51.652 --> 00:29:52.553]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.033 --> 00:29:54.655]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.575 --> 00:29:58.258]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.428 --> 00:30:02.950]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:04.252]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:30:04.432 --> 00:30:07.837]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:30:07.957 --> 00:30:08.397]  Phenol!
[00:30:08.698 --> 00:30:15.767]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:30:16.328 --> 00:30:20.209]  The FDA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:30:20.309 --> 00:30:20.769]  Fragrance?
[00:30:21.129 --> 00:30:25.911]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:30:26.031 --> 00:30:30.732]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[00:30:30.952 --> 00:30:33.513]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Calden shampoo.
[00:30:33.753 --> 00:30:37.174]  Well, like all of the products from the Calden Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:30:37.314 --> 00:30:40.835]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:30:41.075 --> 00:30:43.438]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.

[00:32:01.263 --> 00:32:02.945]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:32:03.025 --> 00:32:05.547]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[00:32:05.727 --> 00:32:06.408]  It feels great.
[00:32:06.588 --> 00:32:07.649]  Absolutely wonderful.
[00:32:07.729 --> 00:32:13.254]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:32:13.574 --> 00:32:15.076]  Kimberly, tell us about your success.
[00:32:15.356 --> 00:32:17.718]  Okay, I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[00:32:17.858 --> 00:32:20.961]  I've lost 16 pounds and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[00:32:21.141 --> 00:32:21.822]  Incredible!
[00:32:22.022 --> 00:32:23.244]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[00:32:23.264 --> 00:32:26.988]  I have a 21-month-old child and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[00:32:27.068 --> 00:32:27.869]  Well, that's for sure.
[00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:28.610]  Was it easy?
[00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:29.451]  Very easy.
[00:32:29.491 --> 00:32:30.372]  I mean, there's nothing to it.
[00:32:30.412 --> 00:32:35.558]  You can actually still continue to eat meals with your children and not starve yourself or anything else and lose weight.
[00:32:36.138 --> 00:32:42.062]  You can lose fat the safe and healthy way just like Kimberly did with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:32:42.403 --> 00:32:43.503]  Call right now 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:32:43.543 --> 00:32:43.944]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:32:43.964 --> 00:32:49.688]  Remember, mention you heard it right here and that gets you $25 off a three-month supply.
[00:32:49.708 --> 00:32:50.909]  So call Vim and Vigor today 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:32:50.929 --> 00:32:51.529]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:33:19.445 --> 00:33:24.666]  Alright, a caller, Peter in New Jersey, brought up some really good points.
[00:33:24.906 --> 00:33:34.028]  His second question was, why would I tune in to the focus on the families, the J. Seculos, the
[00:33:36.491 --> 00:33:38.332]  The heads of the Christian Coalition.
[00:33:39.073 --> 00:33:44.497]  Why aren't they talking about the New York Post admitting gay porn stars servicing, you know, the world leaders?
[00:33:44.517 --> 00:33:46.178]  I mean, that was their headline.
[00:33:48.259 --> 00:33:53.803]  Why don't they talk about how Edwards is basically appointed by the Bilderberg Group?
[00:33:53.823 --> 00:33:56.925]  I mean, the New York Times admitted it a month after we broke the story.
[00:33:58.246 --> 00:33:58.987]  But Jim Tucker,
[00:34:00.241 --> 00:34:02.302]  Why do they say the Patriot Act is good?
[00:34:02.362 --> 00:34:04.143]  I mean, I listen to Christian talk radio.
[00:34:04.183 --> 00:34:06.784]  I mean, it's like listening to satanic radio or something.
[00:34:08.364 --> 00:34:09.645]  It's just incredible.
[00:34:09.725 --> 00:34:10.945]  I mean, the lies.
[00:34:10.965 --> 00:34:13.106]  These men and women are not stupid, by the way.
[00:34:15.487 --> 00:34:18.188]  You know, why are some of them saying, oh, the chip's not bad.
[00:34:18.208 --> 00:34:19.728]  I mean, I've even heard that.
[00:34:19.769 --> 00:34:22.249]  China's got to have forced abortion and fantasy.
[00:34:22.269 --> 00:34:23.290]  You know, they've got a problem.
[00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:24.130]  They've got to do something.
[00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:26.231]  Then I'm bad for reporting on that.
[00:34:27.153 --> 00:34:28.615]  You know, why is this happening?
[00:34:28.715 --> 00:34:37.483]  Because, folks, they got all our confidence exposing Bill Clinton, the so-called conservatives, because what they said about Bill Clinton was true.
[00:34:37.564 --> 00:34:38.585]  He was really bad.
[00:34:40.547 --> 00:34:44.030]  But they tried to stay off the subject of Chinese generals and missile secrets.
[00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:45.692]  They tried to stick to the sexual stuff.
[00:34:47.222 --> 00:34:48.382]  You know, some of the lying.
[00:34:48.903 --> 00:34:50.063]  Really, side issues.
[00:34:50.083 --> 00:34:58.745]  I mean, they're important issues, but they're side issues for the globalists because then it doesn't implicate Republican leaders who are all involved in the nuclear reactor transfers and missile secret transfers.
[00:34:59.125 --> 00:35:02.747]  Those are the Republican companies doing that with Clinton giving the okay.
[00:35:05.807 --> 00:35:06.988]  They're sold out, folks.
[00:35:07.028 --> 00:35:07.708]  They've been told.
[00:35:07.728 --> 00:35:14.410]  I mean, Pat Robertson was writing books about the New World Order and doing a pretty good job until about, what, six years ago, seven years ago.
[00:35:15.123 --> 00:35:22.828]  When they went after his 501c3 tax exemption for his TV network, I mean, what he owns like, I don't know, it was like 15 different TV channels are dead.
[00:35:22.868 --> 00:35:23.569]  He sold some of them.
[00:35:24.329 --> 00:35:29.753]  And they came after him and he was about to lose that empire, so suddenly, you know, he backed off.
[00:35:31.535 --> 00:35:34.517]  It's like NPR used to be decidedly what you'd call liberal.
[00:35:34.557 --> 00:35:37.799]  Now it's, you know, really what you'd call balanced in the fake paradigm.
[00:35:37.859 --> 00:35:39.480]  Bush is good, Kerry's good, you know.
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.563]  Because they were told, hey, you're going to lose your funding if you don't start neoconning.
[00:35:45.243 --> 00:35:47.525]  So, all these groups have been compromised.
[00:35:47.545 --> 00:36:00.235]  The so-called liberal media suddenly lies and propagandizes, and the New York Times lies for Bush about aluminum tubes, and Iraq, and Niger uranium, and CIA reports.
[00:36:01.076 --> 00:36:04.839]  And then later reports how Bush is a liar, and it's just a joke.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:10.944]  So, as the New World Order emerges, as it comes onto the stage,
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:23.165]  As the whore of Babylon rises, you know, as this begins, here in the final equation, in the final act of this deal, we're really finding out who was who.
[00:36:25.506 --> 00:36:27.287]  And a lot of people just can't get past that.
[00:36:27.747 --> 00:36:30.228]  Now, the caller says, well, who do I vote for, then?
[00:36:30.248 --> 00:36:37.892]  I mean, we know Kerry's bad, we know Bush is bad, we know they're really, for the same policies, just different rhetoric.
[00:36:38.292 --> 00:36:39.192]  Who do we vote for?
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.701]  Or should we even vote?
[00:36:42.901 --> 00:36:49.485]  Well, about 32% of the country now has the electronic touchscreen systems in.
[00:36:50.386 --> 00:36:56.410]  The majority of it is four different companies, all run by former NSA or CIA chiefs or deputy chiefs.
[00:36:57.558 --> 00:37:03.943]  They are fighting to keep bills out of Congress, like Rush Holt's bill that would have there be a paper ballot record for recounts.
[00:37:03.963 --> 00:37:04.963]  They're fighting against that.
[00:37:05.003 --> 00:37:06.424]  They're fighting against audits of it.
[00:37:06.785 --> 00:37:08.486]  They're fighting against any transparency.
[00:37:08.526 --> 00:37:09.867]  I mean, that right there is pretty obvious.
[00:37:10.307 --> 00:37:15.911]  Plus, we have their own engineers quitting and saying it's a fraud, and they're caught with felons running the companies as vice presidents.
[00:37:16.585 --> 00:37:22.927]  Defrauding elections with wireless modems entering into the machines during elections in 2002 and 2003.
[00:37:23.047 --> 00:37:26.108]  Coast-to-coast stealing elections.
[00:37:26.468 --> 00:37:28.648]  I mean, all of that is confirmed, folks.
[00:37:30.169 --> 00:37:38.671]  But there's still a vote, but the problem is that 30% they could use that already to sway elections unless there's a really big turnout in one direction.
[00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:43.111]  So we've almost lost our right to vote right there at that level.
[00:37:43.451 --> 00:37:45.711]  There's still the ballot box in some areas.
[00:37:45.751 --> 00:37:50.092]  There's still the jury box, the grand jury box.
[00:37:50.633 --> 00:37:52.133]  Those are other forms of voting.
[00:37:52.833 --> 00:37:55.054]  There's the soap box.
[00:37:55.114 --> 00:37:56.474]  There's the boycott box.
[00:37:57.094 --> 00:38:00.335]  There's different ways to vote and still have power and still have an effect.
[00:38:02.765 --> 00:38:16.990]  We can vote with our minds and our actions by being a police officer or a firefighter or a government minion who just quietly doesn't follow orders, quietly doesn't violate the Constitution, quietly wakes up other people in their department.
[00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:24.692]  So, another facet to this is we focus far too much on Kerry and Bush.
[00:38:26.104 --> 00:38:30.185]  And it is true that Congress has given up much of its authority to the Executive.
[00:38:30.205 --> 00:38:32.466]  So the Executive is the most powerful branch in government.
[00:38:32.886 --> 00:38:38.568]  It was supposed to be the weakest branch in government, with the Congress being the most powerful, then the Judicial and the Executive.
[00:38:39.028 --> 00:38:40.309]  And the Founding Fathers said that.
[00:38:41.329 --> 00:38:46.751]  Now Congress has been turned into the bald-headed stepchild, the Cinderella.
[00:38:47.435 --> 00:38:56.777]  And the 9-11 Whitewash Commission blamed Congress for not giving more funding, and we doubled it, and not giving up all their authority to a domestic CIA that runs its own funding.
[00:38:56.797 --> 00:38:59.498]  And so now they're going to go do that and give up all their authority.
[00:38:59.518 --> 00:39:04.119]  They've already done it on trade, on borders, on almost everything.
[00:39:05.519 --> 00:39:11.501]  But while Congress has still got some authority, you need to get good people into Congress, but then your state's even more important.
[00:39:12.821 --> 00:39:14.041]  People in your legislature.
[00:39:15.482 --> 00:39:16.322]  Your House members.
[00:39:16.342 --> 00:39:17.082]  Your Senate members.
[00:39:17.988 --> 00:39:22.830]  Your sheriffs, your county commissioners, your city council members.
[00:39:23.651 --> 00:39:31.014]  And they may put in their electronic voting machines with their voter assistance bureau that's called for suspending the election, maybe.
[00:39:31.955 --> 00:39:34.356]  They're the ones saying, oh, put these in your cities.
[00:39:34.856 --> 00:39:36.737]  Well, seven states have already said no.
[00:39:37.537 --> 00:39:41.479]  Other states are moving to remove them, but then the feds put in injunctions and block that.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:45.341]  You're going to have to have a recall vote with a paper ballot.
[00:39:45.361 --> 00:39:46.442]  You're first going to have to have a
[00:39:48.123 --> 00:39:48.803]  This is how you do it.
[00:39:48.823 --> 00:40:04.373]  You're first going to have to have a recall petition, a paper ballot petition, just to have a paper ballot recall election on the electronic voting machines.
[00:40:04.934 --> 00:40:14.360]  Again, just like before the Bill of Rights Defense League was formed, I said we need to have cities and counties throw the Patriot Act out at a Tenth Amendment level at the state and county level.
[00:40:15.931 --> 00:40:19.993]  We wrote up the first proposal, people picked up on it, and now over 400 cities.
[00:40:20.313 --> 00:40:21.674]  Now I think it's five states now.
[00:40:22.554 --> 00:40:25.736]  Now Canada has moved against the Patriot Act because it even affects them.
[00:40:25.756 --> 00:40:27.717]  I have that article today.
[00:40:28.717 --> 00:40:30.078]  And again, I'm not even that smart.
[00:40:30.158 --> 00:40:31.799]  I don't know why I have to think this stuff up.
[00:40:32.479 --> 00:40:33.880]  But I've told you the idea.
[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:37.081]  If you want to write some articles about it, get it out to people, get it rolling, fine.
[00:40:37.722 --> 00:40:44.305]  You're going to have to have a petition to have paper ballots, and then you're going to have to have in that
[00:40:45.345 --> 00:40:55.218]  That a board will oversee the paper ballots, and that citizens, you know, let's say,
[00:40:56.530 --> 00:41:18.161]  You can think of the ways to do it, but let's say 50,000 citizens in your city, if it's a big city, will be randomly selected in a raffle, not a central raffle, but a district-by-district, and then those people are there counting the ballots with citizens that want to show up watching that.
[00:41:18.641 --> 00:41:21.202]  And then the numbers aren't fed into a computer to tabulate.
[00:41:22.183 --> 00:41:23.503]  Or it's over, okay?
[00:41:23.944 --> 00:41:24.524]  It is over.
[00:41:26.222 --> 00:41:30.326]  Already, the old computerized ballots, they were scantrons and bubble sheets.
[00:41:32.228 --> 00:41:39.935]  Those were fed through a computer where they could defraud things, but then there could be a recount, and they go back and look at the scantrons, and you find out they cheated people.
[00:41:41.156 --> 00:41:43.158]  They caught counties and cities shooting hundreds of times.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.923]  So, total corruption, total takeover is upon you.
[00:41:50.027 --> 00:42:01.901]  And that's why they're militarizing the police, that's why they're trying to intimidate you, that's why they're trying to say you can't protest and demonstrate or you have to do it inside a cage, inside another cage like Houdini, with no news cameras on you.
[00:42:03.323 --> 00:42:07.047]  They're doing all of this to send that message that you're a slave!
[00:42:09.691 --> 00:42:12.773]  And so, no, I am not going to vote in the presidential election.
[00:42:12.833 --> 00:42:26.761]  I'm not going to vote, you know, if I have a choice between Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, Bush is Hitler, literally, and Kerry is Stalin, or Mao Zedong, take your pick, I'm not going to vote for the Communists or the Fascists.
[00:42:27.661 --> 00:42:31.704]  The cousins, members of the same secret group, run by the Bilderberg Organization.
[00:42:32.104 --> 00:42:33.345]  I mean, it's a joke.
[00:42:34.666 --> 00:42:38.808]  I'll write in a candidate or pick a Constitution Party or a Libertarian or somebody else.
[00:42:40.186 --> 00:42:44.367]  But again, I personally am not going to vote because we don't have voting in Austin anymore.
[00:42:45.368 --> 00:42:46.888]  All the electronic machines went in.
[00:42:46.908 --> 00:42:48.389]  It's a total fraud.
[00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:50.189]  And I've challenged them.
[00:42:50.229 --> 00:42:51.470]  I'm on the record as saying this.
[00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:53.751]  And this is the end of the road, folks.
[00:42:54.911 --> 00:43:00.653]  And I think you should go out and protest on election night and hold up signs saying we don't have an election.
[00:43:02.213 --> 00:43:06.635]  And write up little one-page printouts with the facts to hand out to people.
[00:43:08.012 --> 00:43:10.393]  We've got to stop playing along with their game.
[00:43:12.694 --> 00:43:16.796]  I mean, you know, reading the text of Bill Clinton, you know, it made me want to go vote for Bush.
[00:43:16.836 --> 00:43:18.477]  But I have to remember, they're business partners.
[00:43:18.517 --> 00:43:18.957]  They met.
[00:43:19.117 --> 00:43:20.338]  His father and Clinton met.
[00:43:20.378 --> 00:43:21.999]  They staged the 92 election.
[00:43:22.599 --> 00:43:23.420]  They're in business.
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.701]  Kerry and Bush, it's totally staged.
[00:43:26.481 --> 00:43:28.722]  In 04, it's just totally staged.
[00:43:29.282 --> 00:43:30.623]  Just stop being diverted.
[00:43:31.043 --> 00:43:33.124]  You know, what's the local average?
[00:43:33.164 --> 00:43:36.526]  It's like 8% of the population votes in local elections.
[00:43:37.756 --> 00:43:42.200]  55% vote nationally when it's a big presidential election.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:45.342]  What, like 30% when it's an off-year election for Congress?
[00:43:46.002 --> 00:43:51.266]  It should be 100% for county and city and state if you don't have electronic machines.
[00:43:51.946 --> 00:43:55.549]  And then 10% for the presidential election.
[00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:58.011]  It's a joke.
[00:43:58.151 --> 00:43:59.652]  Everything is backwards, people.
[00:44:00.994 --> 00:44:02.655]  Alright, an important question.
[00:44:03.095 --> 00:44:07.157]  Sorry I spent ten minutes on it, but let's go to James in North Carolina.
[00:44:07.217 --> 00:44:07.957]  James, go ahead.
[00:44:08.237 --> 00:44:09.258]  Hey, how you doing?
[00:44:09.418 --> 00:44:09.698]  Good.
[00:44:10.618 --> 00:44:13.380]  We got that same kind of scam going down here.
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:19.282]  We just had our state and local elections in Cumberland County and Robeson County.
[00:44:19.342 --> 00:44:20.723]  I live in Robeson County.
[00:44:20.943 --> 00:44:21.183]  Yes.
[00:44:21.323 --> 00:44:25.565]  And they already reported that at least
[00:44:26.243 --> 00:44:30.786]  Sixty percent of the people wouldn't show up to vote because they knew it wouldn't do any good.
[00:44:30.827 --> 00:44:33.428]  We've had scams down here like you wouldn't believe.
[00:44:33.469 --> 00:44:34.229]  Well, that's the thing.
[00:44:34.289 --> 00:44:43.936]  You can type the name of almost any county in from any state and put election fraud after it, and it will be people caught doing it for decades.
[00:44:45.618 --> 00:44:53.023]  Just look, there's video in Florida in the eighties of the League of Women Voters falsifying votes.
[00:44:53.444 --> 00:44:54.985]  They snuck in with a hidden camera.
[00:44:55.922 --> 00:45:05.186]  The guy who shot it got arrested, and then now the League of Women Voters is arguing federally against there being a paper record of how you vote.
[00:45:05.226 --> 00:45:06.186]  I mean, this is the freedom.
[00:45:06.486 --> 00:45:08.647]  I mean, how much more obvious does it have to get?
[00:45:08.667 --> 00:45:17.790]  Well, it's just like watching the few minutes of the Democratic Convention and Illuminati and all that.
[00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:18.771]  You can't win.
[00:45:19.091 --> 00:45:21.492]  There's no way to win because people down here
[00:45:22.247 --> 00:45:26.409]  There's a church on every corner and they're for Bush 100% now.
[00:45:27.209 --> 00:45:28.070]  Each is own.
[00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:33.052]  But they don't even realize what happened when all this stuff started.
[00:45:33.793 --> 00:45:38.775]  And they look at me like I'm an idiot, but I listen to you and I listen to other shows.
[00:45:39.535 --> 00:45:43.437]  And I can guarantee you that the people down here are just lost.
[00:45:44.038 --> 00:45:45.578]  We've lost all our jobs.
[00:45:47.799 --> 00:45:48.219]  You know.
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:49.320]  Well, wait a minute.
[00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:54.023]  Bush said earlier this year that export of jobs is our number one industry.
[00:45:54.043 --> 00:45:55.304]  That's an actual quote.
[00:45:55.904 --> 00:45:56.625]  And it's good.
[00:45:56.765 --> 00:46:02.549]  And that hamburger jobs are industrial, value-added, high-tech jobs.
[00:46:02.609 --> 00:46:04.350]  Don't you like your factory job in McDonald's?
[00:46:05.631 --> 00:46:05.751]  Oh!
[00:46:05.991 --> 00:46:11.535]  Well, we don't have factory jobs down here, but I used to drive a truck and made real good money down here with local.
[00:46:12.095 --> 00:46:16.258]  And all the yarn factories went out of business and went to Mexico or overseas.
[00:46:17.219 --> 00:46:17.880]  And that's it.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:18.881]  They wiped us out.
[00:46:19.301 --> 00:46:20.382]  Thanks for the call, my friend.
[00:46:21.123 --> 00:46:29.230]  And I've even heard NPR giggle, and I've heard Globalist giggle on C-SPAN that Americans have had it too good, too long, and we're going to be brought down.
[00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:31.692]  Yeah, but the elite's going to get even more powerful.
[00:46:32.213 --> 00:46:33.474]  They don't want a middle class.
[00:46:34.915 --> 00:46:37.878]  But the neocons have convinced the middle class that they represent them.
[00:46:39.059 --> 00:46:40.981]  We're being double-teamed by Bush and Kerry.
[00:46:42.338 --> 00:46:45.019]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dan in Texas.
[00:46:45.059 --> 00:46:45.740]  Dan, welcome.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:46.840]  Hey, Alex.
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:47.420]  How are you?
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:47.881]  Good.
[00:46:48.381 --> 00:46:50.122]  I've been listening to you for a while.
[00:46:50.142 --> 00:46:53.523]  I saw you in Crawford last March 20th.
[00:46:53.923 --> 00:46:57.225]  Can I ask you a question about subscribing to Prison Planet TV?
[00:46:57.905 --> 00:46:58.225]  Yes, sir.
[00:46:58.245 --> 00:46:58.605]  Go ahead.
[00:47:00.146 --> 00:47:09.950]  I think it was Monday, maybe Tuesday, I subscribed to Prison Planet TV and seemed to be having trouble
[00:47:10.723 --> 00:47:15.005]  Getting in to see the Matrix of Evil and 9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[00:47:15.566 --> 00:47:19.408]  Is there a number I can call that they can help me figure out how to do that?
[00:47:19.848 --> 00:47:31.355]  Okay, I'd say about 1% of the members have trouble when they first sign up and it may be your computer, it may be the software you have for watching movies.
[00:47:32.216 --> 00:47:32.396]  Right.
[00:47:32.416 --> 00:47:35.757]  And on the website we have free downloads of the software.
[00:47:36.398 --> 00:47:38.879]  We have Mac and PC enabled systems.
[00:47:39.459 --> 00:47:40.539]  Okay.
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:43.901]  And Paul Watson is the customer service.
[00:47:43.941 --> 00:47:45.321]  He does that via email.
[00:47:45.341 --> 00:47:45.921]  Okay.
[00:47:45.941 --> 00:47:48.963]  And it says contact Webmaster Customer Service.
[00:47:49.283 --> 00:47:49.623]  Right.
[00:47:49.643 --> 00:47:54.265]  Click there, email him, and tell him what's happening and he'll email you back and fix it.
[00:47:54.965 --> 00:47:55.305]  Okay.
[00:47:55.365 --> 00:47:56.706]  And then my comment.
[00:47:58.586 --> 00:48:25.536]  I found it interesting with the Bilderberg ticket that with what you see going on with the armed ninja guys carrying their M-16s and the little internment camp for protesters and throw in on top of that on the convention floor that these candidates weren't allowed to carry their peace signs in.
[00:48:26.685 --> 00:48:35.829]  Uh, they were confiscated and then Teresa Hines, Carrie, gets up there and talks about defending her right to speak, to have her opinion.
[00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:47.875]  And it kind of seems to me that, uh, I guess what we conclude is that she has a right to speak and have her opinion, uh, but the people outside do not.
[00:48:48.743 --> 00:48:54.768]  Well, we now lock protesters in cages inside cages and aim M60 machine guns at them.
[00:48:55.368 --> 00:48:59.471]  We now have helicopters swarming, men in federally issued Darth Vader outfits.
[00:49:00.452 --> 00:49:01.973]  None of this has to do with freedom.
[00:49:03.274 --> 00:49:08.518]  It's all to train us, because they've got a lot of horrible stuff coming down the pike and they know we're going to riot.
[00:49:08.838 --> 00:49:10.039]  They know we're going to protest.
[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:13.222]  And so they're gearing up over the last decade
[00:49:13.911 --> 00:49:15.712]  To oppress the population.
[00:49:15.772 --> 00:49:20.155]  It's so obvious what they're doing and it's disgusting.
[00:49:20.775 --> 00:49:29.821]  Well, I haven't heard anyone at this convention address the treatment of the protesters outside and their right to assemble and speak.
[00:49:30.742 --> 00:49:32.223]  Just kind of found that curious.
[00:49:32.243 --> 00:49:33.864]  Well, the convention is a total theater.
[00:49:33.904 --> 00:49:34.984]  Thanks for the call, Dan.
[00:49:35.325 --> 00:49:38.106]  And thanks for signing up for 15 Cents a Day at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:49:40.769 --> 00:49:43.831]  And folks just love it, and I hope people will go check it out.
[00:49:45.191 --> 00:49:46.292]  Let's take another call here.
[00:49:46.572 --> 00:49:47.732]  Rob in South Carolina.
[00:49:47.772 --> 00:49:48.393]  Rob, go ahead.
[00:49:48.733 --> 00:49:51.414]  Hey Alex, I got a quick comment on the vaccines and everything.
[00:49:51.434 --> 00:49:52.475]  Okay.
[00:49:52.515 --> 00:49:56.777]  It's cool, like right now they're making us take another one for rubella down here in South Carolina.
[00:49:57.557 --> 00:50:01.119]  I think it's kind of sick with all the mercury they already put in them to dumb us down enough.
[00:50:01.739 --> 00:50:03.620]  With all the brain kind of things, you know?
[00:50:04.969 --> 00:50:17.272]  Well, yeah, we read the article a few days ago about they're going to give you an inoculation so you won't be a drug addict to the children, but it also plugs up the receptors in the brain for natural endorphins and pleasure.
[00:50:18.133 --> 00:50:22.034]  And now the MMR shot has 250 times safe levels of mercury.
[00:50:22.054 --> 00:50:23.014]  That's the Associated Press.
[00:50:23.794 --> 00:50:27.515]  And they're trying to force you to take more, and they're claiming it's the law.
[00:50:28.215 --> 00:50:31.356]  No, it's the law that they can't make you take it, and they got a waiver.
[00:50:31.636 --> 00:50:33.817]  But the news will lie and say it's the law.
[00:50:33.877 --> 00:50:34.237]  Go ahead.
[00:50:34.798 --> 00:50:35.578]  Yeah, definitely.
[00:50:35.618 --> 00:50:42.100]  And like, half of my school already... Like, I've had some really, really weird questions asked in my US history classes and stuff like that.
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:44.261]  They don't even know what, like, democracy is now.
[00:50:44.281 --> 00:50:46.201]  I tell you what, stay there.
[00:50:46.221 --> 00:50:47.621]  I want to hear from you.
[00:50:47.661 --> 00:50:48.982]  You're in public school right now.
[00:50:49.302 --> 00:50:49.542]  Yeah.
[00:50:50.102 --> 00:50:51.042]  Stay there, Rob.
[00:50:51.082 --> 00:50:53.063]  We'll come back to you, then Tom, David, and others.
[00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:56.344]  A lot of news coming up, and a guest for some Planet.TV folks.
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:08.304]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.604 --> 00:51:09.985]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.165 --> 00:51:12.366]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.526 --> 00:51:14.607]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:14.887 --> 00:51:19.850]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:24.192]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.452 --> 00:51:26.233]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.293 --> 00:51:36.935]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.095 --> 00:51:38.996]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:51:39.196 --> 00:51:43.037]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns in the Info War.

[00:52:02.685 --> 00:52:06.767]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:52:06.927 --> 00:52:09.807]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:52:09.887 --> 00:52:16.589]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:52:16.769 --> 00:52:19.790]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:22.371]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:52:22.511 --> 00:52:27.232]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[00:52:27.412 --> 00:52:42.000]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are extracted.
[00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:48.784]  Supercharge your Gravity Filter today, and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96, or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at

[00:54:05.801 --> 00:54:08.343]  The globalists know the levy is breaking.
[00:54:10.265 --> 00:54:13.087]  They know that people are awake to their activities.
[00:54:14.368 --> 00:54:20.211]  And so they've been preemptively gearing up for the oppressive forces they need.
[00:54:22.272 --> 00:54:31.198]  But many of those oppressors are waking up and realizing that it's their families, it's their future, it's their descendants who they're ruining.
[00:54:32.559 --> 00:54:36.181]  I mean, I speak to people's most innate instincts to stand up against this.
[00:54:36.241 --> 00:54:38.162]  You know in your guts it's true.
[00:54:39.591 --> 00:54:40.751]  You can look around you.
[00:54:41.852 --> 00:54:44.133]  It's now time for you to stand up and get involved.
[00:54:45.333 --> 00:54:53.616]  We'll go back to Rob in South Carolina, then Tom David, Melissa Gloria, and countless others that want to get involved on air today.
[00:54:53.656 --> 00:54:59.599]  We got Glenn Spencer about the open border situation and potential terrorists released due to lack of jail space.
[00:54:59.659 --> 00:55:00.219]  Yeah, sure.
[00:55:00.239 --> 00:55:02.960]  Oh, the Brownsville Herald.
[00:55:05.157 --> 00:55:06.658]  And we'll continue with your calls as well.
[00:55:06.718 --> 00:55:09.100]  Plus, they want to put a microchip in you when you go into the hospital.
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:09.780]  I told you!
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:11.542]  You should have seen that news.
[00:55:12.723 --> 00:55:14.804]  They can find a big technology publication.
[00:55:15.424 --> 00:55:19.988]  Before we go back to the calls, though, folks, I'm not going to belabor this for five hours.
[00:55:20.868 --> 00:55:22.450]  I've made a lot of films, ten of them.
[00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:24.211]  I carry a lot of other great videos.

[00:57:15.538 --> 00:57:16.219]  Please take action.
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:20.002]  Talking to Rob in South Carolina, a high school student.
[00:57:21.123 --> 00:57:24.887]  So you guys have already had vaccines, but they want you to take more, huh?
[00:57:25.748 --> 00:57:28.470]  Yeah, they just introduced these two now, like right in 99.
[00:57:29.730 --> 00:57:30.010]  I don't know.
[00:57:30.030 --> 00:57:31.031]  It's still kind of creepy.
[00:57:31.271 --> 00:57:34.133]  They say they're going to add more and more new ones to go to college.
[00:57:34.153 --> 00:57:35.073]  You've got to have them.
[00:57:35.573 --> 00:57:37.234]  Oh, you've got to have a smallpox shot.
[00:57:37.254 --> 00:57:38.455]  You've got to have an anthrax shot.
[00:57:38.475 --> 00:57:40.716]  You've got to have all these new shots.
[00:57:41.337 --> 00:57:41.597]  Yeah.
[00:57:41.957 --> 00:57:45.940]  Like my friend who graduated last year, they're offering him to get in the military now.
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:48.141]  And then he just got this vaccination.
[00:57:48.161 --> 00:57:49.121]  I don't know.
[00:57:49.301 --> 00:57:50.002]  It's like creepy.
[00:57:50.502 --> 00:57:51.703]  Well, you didn't take it, did you?
[00:57:52.116 --> 00:57:57.859]  Well, no, I have to take it next year if I have to get there, but I'm going to try getting a religious exemption or something.
[00:57:57.979 --> 00:58:19.151]  Sir, they have a religious, a conscientious, and a moral objection at the health department, and by law they've got to give it to you, and they've got it in the principal's desk, but they get federal funds for doping you up, and so sue their behinds, hand out handbills in class, warning people about the vaccines, go to the Brave New World, New World Order section of PrisonPlanet.com,
[00:58:19.691 --> 00:58:25.775]  Or use searchinfowars.com, it's a website, to type in vaccine 250 times the mercury.
[00:58:26.235 --> 00:58:27.276]  Take that into them.
[00:58:27.596 --> 00:58:32.899]  Take them the ABC News article about the CDC admitting it's brain damaging people.
[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:33.800]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:36.422]  I'm already giving your videos out to friends I know too, so... Good!
[00:58:37.022 --> 00:58:39.303]  Don't let them assault you at this high school.
[00:58:39.884 --> 00:58:40.404]  Yeah, I know.
[00:58:40.544 --> 00:58:41.245]  Can't let it happen, man.
[00:58:41.365 --> 00:58:43.426]  Don't let them assault your brain, my friend.
[00:58:44.517 --> 00:58:45.218]  All right, good job.
[00:58:45.238 --> 00:58:46.539]  You keep it up, my friend.
[00:58:46.979 --> 00:58:49.941]  All right, second hour calls, news, guests coming up.
[00:58:50.061 --> 00:58:55.385]  I'll stay with it.
[00:58:57.947 --> 00:58:58.607]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.268 --> 00:59:00.348]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.049 --> 00:59:02.130]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.810 --> 00:59:03.611]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.371 --> 00:59:05.152]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.936 --> 00:59:09.878]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.118 --> 00:59:14.220]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.743 --> 00:59:28.648]  Pressure from above, pressure from below, the false political spectrum giving you false solutions, fake choices, semantical deceptions.
[00:59:31.189 --> 00:59:34.231]  The Democrats will give you hope, the Mildenberg candidate.
[00:59:36.514 --> 00:59:38.195]  The running mate of Skull and Bones.
[00:59:40.137 --> 00:59:43.239]  They're at the Skull and Bones coronation, as some have called it.
[00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:45.741]  I mean, it's a joke, people.
[00:59:45.801 --> 00:59:48.323]  The whole thing is a big, fat joke.
[00:59:49.524 --> 00:59:50.745]  And they talk about hope.
[00:59:50.825 --> 00:59:52.806]  They want a giant domestic CIA.
[00:59:52.846 --> 00:59:54.247]  They want you in control.
[00:59:54.728 --> 00:59:57.850]  The Democrats, the leadership, all voted for the Patriot Act.
[00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:59.611]  They voted for it again a few weeks ago.
[01:00:00.272 --> 01:00:01.893]  They want you to live under this.
[01:00:01.953 --> 01:00:04.575]  But they want to talk about how they don't like it all day.
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:07.321]  So you don't have a real choice.
[01:00:07.401 --> 01:00:09.821]  And you go, well, what do we do then?
[01:00:09.841 --> 01:00:10.742]  That's going to defeat us.
[01:00:11.242 --> 01:00:13.202]  No, you admit how bad things are.
[01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:14.723]  You admit the enemy you're fighting.
[01:00:15.303 --> 01:00:18.064]  You admit that it's an uphill battle.
[01:00:18.084 --> 01:00:23.666]  And as soon as you admit that, suddenly it becomes a fight on a level playing field.
[01:00:25.366 --> 01:00:30.708]  Coming up, potential terrorists are being released in Texas and other states.
[01:00:31.268 --> 01:00:34.729]  Members of Congress say, and they're illegal aliens, but they're also just released.
[01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:40.848]  But don't worry, the government's going to put protesters inside a cage, inside another cage, and aim machine guns at them.
[01:00:41.869 --> 01:00:46.431]  So we'll get to that with Glenn Spencer, also microchips when you go in the hospital now to be put in your body.
[01:00:47.191 --> 01:00:47.812]  See, folks?
[01:00:47.932 --> 01:00:49.052]  I mean, it's coming down on us.
[01:00:49.993 --> 01:00:51.894]  But right now, let's go to the calls.
[01:00:51.994 --> 01:00:55.036]  Let's talk to Tom in Florida.
[01:00:55.096 --> 01:00:55.956]  Tom, welcome!
[01:00:56.316 --> 01:00:57.217]  Alex, how are you doing today?
[01:00:57.257 --> 01:00:57.857]  Good, my friend.
[01:00:58.277 --> 01:01:01.359]  I have an article that I got off the internet a few minutes ago.
[01:01:01.399 --> 01:01:02.260]  My son did, actually.
[01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:03.680]  It's from the St.
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:04.681]  Augustine Register.
[01:01:05.393 --> 01:01:08.756]  Publication date, 7-14-04 by C.B.
[01:01:08.896 --> 01:01:09.697]  Heimbold.
[01:01:10.638 --> 01:01:13.240]  Communist Party USA supports John Kerry.
[01:01:14.041 --> 01:01:15.282]  I have emailed you this article.
[01:01:16.163 --> 01:01:19.586]  It details how the Communist Party USA supports John Kerry.
[01:01:20.587 --> 01:01:27.353]  And they are even giving a pamphlet out you can download and hand out in both English and Spanish called, Top Ten Reasons to Defeat Bush.
[01:01:28.354 --> 01:01:29.996]  And the article even talks about how
[01:01:30.498 --> 01:01:35.880]  Remarkably, these planks are identical to those of the Democratic Party, outsourcing homosexual rights and abortion.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.401]  And then it goes on to talk about Kerry's campaign.
[01:01:40.261 --> 01:01:42.862]  His theme is, Let America be America Again.
[01:01:43.422 --> 01:01:48.104]  And the slogan was borrowed from a communist poet named Langston Hughes.
[01:01:49.004 --> 01:01:52.985]  And it's a very dark, gloomy poem.
[01:01:53.726 --> 01:01:58.267]  And in another poem, the article goes on to say that Langston Hughes has written, he talks about
[01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:01.381]  Goodbye, Christ, Jesus, Lord, God, Jehovah.
[01:02:01.981 --> 01:02:04.942]  Feed it on away from here now.
[01:02:07.622 --> 01:02:08.102]  Incredible.
[01:02:08.242 --> 01:02:10.003]  Communist Party, Morton John Kerry.
[01:02:10.703 --> 01:02:11.043]  It's here.
[01:02:12.163 --> 01:02:14.884]  Well, and at the same time, the U.S.
[01:02:15.024 --> 01:02:22.106]  government under Lord Bush is actually helping put the Communist Party in as the new government along with the former Ba'athist.
[01:02:22.757 --> 01:02:23.357]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:02:23.437 --> 01:02:25.599]  So we have Bush, I mean literally folks, we're not kidding.
[01:02:25.999 --> 01:02:27.920]  The second biggest part of the government is the communists.
[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:29.661]  They're out there supporting him with red flags.
[01:02:30.081 --> 01:02:34.884]  And then we've got Kerry, his cousin, his skull and bones mate, over here.
[01:02:36.064 --> 01:02:46.910]  Did you see the new American analysis of Congress, where the only admitted socialist member of Congress is more conservative in his voting record than most Republicans?
[01:02:47.491 --> 01:02:48.131]  That's terrible.
[01:02:49.985 --> 01:02:58.709]  In this article it talks about a Vietnam vet group took a trip to communist Hanoi because they had heard that there was a Hanoi Hall of Fame.
[01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:00.930]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:02.631]  They got pictures of John Kerry in there.
[01:03:02.651 --> 01:03:05.292]  They got pictures of John Kerry shaking hands with a communist official.
[01:03:07.233 --> 01:03:07.973]  Here's the article.
[01:03:08.314 --> 01:03:10.835]  It's printed in the media just like everything you bring up every day.
[01:03:10.855 --> 01:03:11.215]  But wait a minute.
[01:03:11.235 --> 01:03:12.816]  They told me communists don't exist.
[01:03:12.836 --> 01:03:13.996]  They only run half the planet.
[01:03:14.016 --> 01:03:15.417]  They're taking over dozens of countries.
[01:03:15.677 --> 01:03:16.197]  Absolutely.
[01:03:16.378 --> 01:03:17.238]  But they don't exist.
[01:03:18.032 --> 01:03:25.978]  And so we get Bonesman Kerry, Communist, or we get Neocon, Bonesman, Bush, and we have no other choice.
[01:03:26.178 --> 01:03:27.899]  Vote for them and like it!
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:29.620]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:30.421]  Very well said.
[01:03:30.441 --> 01:03:37.165]  And again, folks, it was the big banks that funded Communism, that funded Hitler.
[01:03:37.265 --> 01:03:39.467]  They create these things like wind-up toys.
[01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:46.798]  In my book, I have Professor Queryl Quigley at Georgetown University laying out how they control both sides.
[01:03:47.158 --> 01:03:47.959]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:47.999 --> 01:03:52.000]  As long as it's command and control, as long as it's tyranny, they don't care what flavor.
[01:03:53.421 --> 01:03:57.742]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:57.942 --> 01:04:02.344]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.504 --> 01:04:06.885]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:06.925 --> 01:04:08.266]  The New World Order.
[01:04:09.026 --> 01:04:09.847]  Panama.
[01:04:10.047 --> 01:04:14.272]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.332 --> 01:04:21.260]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.403]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.783 --> 01:04:34.171]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.392 --> 01:04:39.796]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:05:55.515 --> 01:05:59.339]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:05:59.679 --> 01:06:00.480]  Read the labels.
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:05.044]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:06:05.264 --> 01:06:09.447]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:06:09.828 --> 01:06:14.712]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.

[01:06:58.582 --> 01:07:00.903]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:02.144 --> 01:07:07.627]  Alright my friends, David, Melissa, and Gloria, and Johnny, and Kwame, and
[01:07:08.713 --> 01:07:10.794]  Everybody else that's holding, we're going to get to you.

[01:07:14.135 --> 01:07:15.075]  I'm proud of that fact.
[01:07:15.115 --> 01:07:16.236]  I'm breaking my bad habits.
[01:07:17.156 --> 01:07:18.256]  There is so much news.
[01:07:18.296 --> 01:07:23.078]  Now it's not just the judicial workers that are going to have to have microchips and U.S.
[01:07:23.118 --> 01:07:24.819]  police that they want them to have them.
[01:07:26.219 --> 01:07:28.900]  Now it's going to be if you go to the hospital you're going to get one.
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:30.501]  And there's just so much news.
[01:07:30.581 --> 01:07:37.343]  But I had to get Mr. Spencer, Glenn Spencer, on from AmericanPatrol.com.
[01:07:38.078 --> 01:07:39.078]  He's a great American.
[01:07:39.118 --> 01:07:42.680]  He started out working in Native American Affairs, trying to defend their rights.
[01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:44.400]  He's a great guy.
[01:07:45.941 --> 01:08:01.766]  And, you know, when you go out to one of the events that we put on, or yesterday, at this telecommunications building in Austin, fighting the shutdown of AXS TV, I mean, I would say, frankly, to this show, the biggest majority, you know, of all the groups, are Hispanic Americans.
[01:08:01.826 --> 01:08:03.227]  And statistically, they are the most
[01:08:04.039 --> 01:08:08.761]  Valiant people in war, they win more of the Congressional Medal of Honors than anybody else.
[01:08:09.581 --> 01:08:12.303]  Great patriots, smart, intelligent, wonderful people.
[01:08:12.843 --> 01:08:18.145]  And we're not about to let the liberal media, the controlled elite media, make it a racial issue.
[01:08:19.206 --> 01:08:25.088]  You know, it's like when we exposed the Bilderberg Group appointing John Edwards, and then it comes out in the New York Times that that's what happened.
[01:08:25.108 --> 01:08:27.589]  You know, used to, it's like, oh, that's code word for anti-Semitism.
[01:08:27.929 --> 01:08:31.231]  No, it's the media that are the racists that try to make this a racial debate.
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:38.267]  So when we talk about Mexicans all day, it's because the Mexican government wants the Southwest.
[01:08:38.307 --> 01:08:40.089]  They're run by the big banks in New York.
[01:08:40.530 --> 01:08:43.213]  They want to break this country up as part of the Pan-American Union.
[01:08:43.653 --> 01:08:50.582]  And they're going to use the tens of millions of illegals to drive the wages down and keep Mexico enslaved and then enslave America.
[01:08:51.807 --> 01:09:03.030]  And so, I'm excited to see that most Americans, regardless of race or color, are against these open borders, and the illegal Russians, the illegal Chinese, the illegal whatevers that are pouring in here.
[01:09:03.490 --> 01:09:10.852]  But, again, we talk about Latin America because Latin America is the majority, and it's the border where the majority of people are pouring across.
[01:09:10.872 --> 01:09:14.834]  Now, this article is from Infowars.com.
[01:09:14.874 --> 01:09:16.194]  It's posted on Infowars.com.
[01:09:16.214 --> 01:09:18.155]  It's out of the Brownsville Herald.
[01:09:18.595 --> 01:09:19.495]  We have it posted there.
[01:09:20.228 --> 01:09:31.858]  Potential terrorists released due to lack of jail space, congressman says, Middle Easterners with possible terrorist ties have been detained after entering the country from Mexico, but released for lack of jail space, said U.S.
[01:09:31.899 --> 01:09:36.322]  Representative Ortiz, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee.
[01:09:37.685 --> 01:09:56.165]  They go on to admit that thousands of these people, we've been telling you this forever, just in South Texas alone, yeah, Chinese, Russians, uh, you know, Guatemalans, whatever, uh, Syrians, and the point is, is they got protesters in cages inside cages with machine guns on them,
[01:09:56.681 --> 01:09:59.204]  The Matrix System is watching all Americans.
[01:09:59.484 --> 01:10:00.905]  We're losing all our freedoms.
[01:10:01.346 --> 01:10:02.727]  But the borders are wide open.
[01:10:02.767 --> 01:10:04.109]  It shows that it's a joke.
[01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:05.831]  The War on Terror is a joke.
[01:10:06.131 --> 01:10:07.492]  It's an excuse to enslave us.
[01:10:07.913 --> 01:10:11.076]  Glenn Spencer, thanks for holding during that long rant.
[01:10:11.456 --> 01:10:12.778]  I enjoyed it, Alex.
[01:10:13.607 --> 01:10:15.148]  But good to have you on.
[01:10:15.188 --> 01:10:22.393]  You are the leader of the preeminent national sovereignty border defense organization in the country.
[01:10:22.973 --> 01:10:25.995]  And Glenn, good to have you on to give us an update on what we're facing.
[01:10:26.315 --> 01:10:27.015]  Thank you very much.
[01:10:28.756 --> 01:10:29.457]  What's going on?
[01:10:29.497 --> 01:10:30.758]  I mean, there's so much happening.
[01:10:32.919 --> 01:10:34.300]  Let me tell you what we've got.
[01:10:35.881 --> 01:10:37.482]  For your audience, we'll be telling you this.
[01:10:37.522 --> 01:10:42.405]  We've smuggled simulated weapons of mass destruction into the United States.
[01:10:43.326 --> 01:10:44.726]  And we'll explain how we did that.
[01:10:45.487 --> 01:10:48.487]  It really got started on the 16th of July.
[01:10:48.547 --> 01:10:57.149]  I was listening to Representative Culberson, a Republican from Texas, on a radio show and he explained that the U.S.
[01:10:57.889 --> 01:11:10.472]  Attorney in the Southern District of Texas had told him that Al-Qaeda, members of the Al-Qaeda terrorist organization, had crossed the Mexican border and come into the United States.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:12.360]  Now that was from a U.S.
[01:11:12.421 --> 01:11:13.761]  attorney, a very good story.
[01:11:14.922 --> 01:11:16.562]  Well that set us in motion.
[01:11:16.682 --> 01:11:23.085]  I decided at that moment that American Border Patrol, we're a non-profit organization, we have two former chief U.S.
[01:11:23.145 --> 01:11:25.386]  Border Patrol agents on our board of directors.
[01:11:26.206 --> 01:11:29.748]  We're down on the border, we operate at the border, we know what's going on.
[01:11:30.548 --> 01:11:38.612]  So I had my technical guys, I brought them in and I said, can you guys fabricate a simulated weapon of mass destruction?
[01:11:38.672 --> 01:11:39.132]  Sort of like a
[01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:40.290]  I think?
[01:12:03.226 --> 01:12:05.127]  They got what they call a Pelican case.
[01:12:05.147 --> 01:12:07.528]  It's a waterproof, high-tech suitcase.
[01:12:07.828 --> 01:12:09.669]  And that's pure genius!
[01:12:11.890 --> 01:12:14.871]  Yes, and they went down, filmed the whole thing.
[01:12:14.911 --> 01:12:21.134]  It even had a nuclear and chemical warning symbols on the outside, in color.
[01:12:21.814 --> 01:12:26.436]  A big WMD, and underneath it said simulated.
[01:12:26.456 --> 01:12:28.717]  They put that in a backpack.
[01:12:29.978 --> 01:12:31.959]  They then went down, crossed over the fence,
[01:12:32.745 --> 01:12:33.846]  One guy with a camera.
[01:12:34.486 --> 01:12:35.126]  Watch the fellow.
[01:12:35.166 --> 01:12:36.347]  He steps over the fence.
[01:12:36.827 --> 01:12:38.928]  He didn't have to do much because it was broken there.
[01:12:39.648 --> 01:12:42.169]  And walks, just strolls into the U.S.
[01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:44.890]  And then goes over to the brush.
[01:12:44.931 --> 01:12:45.991]  Now this is in the evening.
[01:12:46.571 --> 01:12:48.612]  Not quite dark, but it's getting there.
[01:12:49.272 --> 01:12:50.373]  And he goes into the brush.
[01:12:51.013 --> 01:12:52.314]  Takes his backpack off.
[01:12:52.974 --> 01:12:55.055]  Removes the weapon of mass destruction.
[01:12:55.375 --> 01:12:56.356]  The simulated one.
[01:12:56.816 --> 01:12:57.996]  Shows it to the camera.
[01:12:58.677 --> 01:13:00.257]  Puts it back in his backpack.
[01:13:00.798 --> 01:13:01.578]  And heads north.
[01:13:02.816 --> 01:13:04.277]  We then dissolve away.
[01:13:04.297 --> 01:13:13.380]  Here they are coming into their safe house in Sierra Vista, Arizona, taking their backpack off and taking out the weapon of mass destruction.
[01:13:14.461 --> 01:13:23.244]  Now we didn't show the whole procedure because some of it, we didn't want to produce a how-to video for invading the United States with a weapon.
[01:13:23.264 --> 01:13:27.446]  But obviously the next thing is you then load it in the back of the trunk of a car and drive it into Phoenix.
[01:13:27.826 --> 01:13:28.967]  And we took it into Tucson.
[01:13:29.227 --> 01:13:29.447]  Yeah.
[01:13:29.952 --> 01:13:32.273]  But I'm saying you could drive into any city you wanted to.
[01:13:32.333 --> 01:13:32.933]  That is correct.
[01:13:33.513 --> 01:13:37.015]  Now what we did, we did this on the 19th, Monday.
[01:13:37.855 --> 01:13:41.356]  And then I was on television and I said, we're going to do it again.
[01:13:41.376 --> 01:13:44.357]  And we're going to do it again and videotape it again.
[01:13:44.377 --> 01:13:56.262]  And a week later, almost to the minute of the time we did it the first time, and within a quarter of a mile where we did it the first time, and the Border Patrol knows where we crossed, we did it again.
[01:13:57.478 --> 01:13:59.159]  And this time we walked farther.
[01:13:59.239 --> 01:14:03.242]  We walked five miles up to a major highway.
[01:14:03.262 --> 01:14:05.584]  It took us three and a half hours.
[01:14:05.824 --> 01:14:07.185]  We were in the major corridor.
[01:14:07.205 --> 01:14:09.507]  Now this isn't way out in the boonies.
[01:14:09.827 --> 01:14:13.429]  This is a major known corridor for illegal aliens.
[01:14:13.810 --> 01:14:15.591]  And there is a border patrol present.
[01:14:16.852 --> 01:14:19.073]  And we walked right past them.
[01:14:19.714 --> 01:14:20.514]  We never saw one.
[01:14:20.755 --> 01:14:21.495]  We never saw one.
[01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:25.278]  And put it into a load vehicle.
[01:14:26.127 --> 01:14:31.329]  Now this isn't somebody's station wagon or SUV that isn't suspicious looking.
[01:14:31.749 --> 01:14:40.452]  What we put it in is a Dodge Pickup 1500 extended cab that actually had been used by Mexican smugglers.
[01:14:41.173 --> 01:14:47.555]  And it had been impounded by the Border Patrol and we purchased it from the tow company that owned it.
[01:14:48.215 --> 01:14:49.916]  So it was an actual vehicle
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:53.165]  Used in the past by Mexican smugglers.
[01:14:53.406 --> 01:14:55.170]  So a known coyote vehicle?
[01:14:55.410 --> 01:14:56.893]  A known coyote vehicle.
[01:14:58.096 --> 01:14:58.397]  Alright?
[01:14:58.417 --> 01:15:00.301]  Glenn, let me stop you before you go any further.
[01:15:00.321 --> 01:15:01.183]  I want folks to understand.
[01:15:01.863 --> 01:15:20.938]  Protesters are in cages inside cages with M60 machine guns pointed at them, sending the message that protesting is illegal, and that we're bad, and they've got the Matrix system spying on everybody, and thumb scanners to get on airplanes, and children being trained how to load on buses as slaves, and all this stuff.
[01:15:21.299 --> 01:15:25.862]  Meanwhile, there's 8,000 border patrols on the southern border, maybe 1,200 on duty at any one time,
[01:15:28.548 --> 01:15:30.950]  They're all leaving to go be air marshals.
[01:15:31.370 --> 01:15:32.291]  This is a joke!
[01:15:32.371 --> 01:15:34.173]  This is a complete joke!
[01:15:34.233 --> 01:15:35.113]  Of course it is.
[01:15:35.954 --> 01:15:41.819]  We then put it, we let it stay in the safe house for a day.
[01:15:42.499 --> 01:15:49.565]  We then put it in the back of another pickup truck and drove past, we skirted where they have a checkpoint.
[01:15:49.745 --> 01:15:51.466]  You know, they have a border patrol at the checkpoint.
[01:15:52.067 --> 01:15:53.768]  We used the road that goes around it.
[01:15:54.790 --> 01:16:00.814]  And drove the, uh, put the weapon of mass destruction in the open bed of the pickup truck, inside the backpack.
[01:16:01.214 --> 01:16:02.235]  Just opened back there.
[01:16:02.255 --> 01:16:04.336]  I drove into Tucson.
[01:16:05.397 --> 01:16:08.359]  Drove into a parking garage next to the Federal Building.
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:09.940]  Got out.
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:15.043]  Put the backpack on and walked up to the front door of the Federal Building in Tucson.
[01:16:15.824 --> 01:16:17.245]  And you videotaped all of this?
[01:16:17.565 --> 01:16:18.886]  And we videotaped all of this.
[01:16:18.906 --> 01:16:20.927]  You can see it on AmericanPatrol.com.
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:26.444]  Now they went up to the federal building and they had a problem with the federal police.
[01:16:27.024 --> 01:16:27.664]  They stopped them.
[01:16:28.125 --> 01:16:28.405]  Why?
[01:16:29.246 --> 01:16:31.027]  Because they don't want them videotaping.
[01:16:31.848 --> 01:16:35.771]  So the guy came out and he said, we don't want you videotaping.
[01:16:36.511 --> 01:16:42.256]  So he asked for their ID and they showed him the ID but he never asked what was in the backpack.
[01:16:43.417 --> 01:16:44.838]  Did you pull it out in front of him?
[01:16:44.858 --> 01:16:44.978]  No.
[01:16:47.573 --> 01:17:00.659]  But, then they took it across the street and pulled it out and showed, they panned from the federal building over and showed this weapon of mass destruction which we had so-called simulated, which we had smuggled.
[01:17:00.679 --> 01:17:01.560]  Now this isn't funny.
[01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:03.781]  Now have you since heard from the feds?
[01:17:04.241 --> 01:17:04.941]  No, not a word.
[01:17:06.382 --> 01:17:08.183]  And I haven't seen much about this in the news.
[01:17:08.203 --> 01:17:09.743]  No, they put a lid on it.
[01:17:11.264 --> 01:17:15.366]  They ran it in the local newspapers and TV the first time we did it.
[01:17:16.534 --> 01:17:17.795]  And they slammed the door on it.
[01:17:17.815 --> 01:17:18.775]  They don't want this known.
[01:17:18.795 --> 01:17:20.296]  They don't want anybody to know about this.
[01:17:21.296 --> 01:17:27.199]  I had an Arizona Republic reporter call me and talk to me about it two days ago, but nothing showed up.
[01:17:28.339 --> 01:17:29.139]  We've had no calls.
[01:17:29.159 --> 01:17:34.142]  Hey, Glenn, can you overnight me or send me that video so I can play it on my local TV show?
[01:17:34.942 --> 01:17:35.182]  Sure.
[01:17:35.822 --> 01:17:36.283]  I'd love to.
[01:17:36.323 --> 01:17:41.845]  Yeah, and then also we'll put it on Texas Frontline because people in Austin need to see this.
[01:17:43.775 --> 01:17:44.715]  Yeah.
[01:17:44.775 --> 01:17:53.459]  Now, Glenn, how does this tie in and feed in with this Brownsville Herald article by Emma Perez Trevino.
[01:17:54.140 --> 01:18:02.403]  She wrote the article about how even the Congressman admits that they capture these Muslims pouring across by the thousands and are ordered to release them.
[01:18:03.744 --> 01:18:11.568]  Well, let me just, of course, and Lou Dobbs last night had a program where they had this South African woman, who was a terrorist,
[01:18:13.154 --> 01:18:13.815]  She's a terrorist.
[01:18:14.795 --> 01:18:18.999]  And they found her trying to get aboard an airplane in Texas.
[01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:19.940]  Right?
[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:21.221]  She was a terrorist.
[01:18:21.901 --> 01:18:30.188]  And in her bag, she had wet clothing because she crossed the Rio Grande the day before.
[01:18:31.149 --> 01:18:32.851]  She crossed illegally.
[01:18:33.691 --> 01:18:34.392]  She's a terrorist.
[01:18:34.812 --> 01:18:35.753]  Come across the border.
[01:18:35.993 --> 01:18:36.814]  That's how they do it.
[01:18:38.447 --> 01:18:43.050]  The people say, yeah, we need to get our troops back from Iraq and stick them on the border.
[01:18:43.470 --> 01:18:45.431]  We'll be right back with Lynn Spencer and your calls.
[01:18:46.232 --> 01:18:50.234]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com, AmericanPatrol.com.
[01:18:54.637 --> 01:18:58.559]  Ladies, for healthier, more radiant skin and hair, you need to start flippin' it.
[01:18:58.879 --> 01:18:59.600]  Do you flip it?
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:02.381]  When I first started flippin' it, I couldn't believe my eyes.
[01:19:02.942 --> 01:19:04.903]  Once you start flippin' it, you'll never stop.
[01:19:05.424 --> 01:19:09.308]  The next time you pick up one of your beauty products, flip it over and examine the ingredients.
[01:19:09.668 --> 01:19:12.250]  You'll be astonished by what the packaging reveals to you.
[01:19:12.711 --> 01:19:17.175]  Many mainstream beauty products are comprised almost entirely of synthetic petrochemicals.

[01:19:53.061 --> 01:19:56.322]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:19:56.382 --> 01:20:00.584]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:20:00.824 --> 01:20:03.606]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:20:03.806 --> 01:20:06.207]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:20:06.387 --> 01:20:15.050]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:20:15.231 --> 01:20:16.571]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:20:16.771 --> 01:20:20.913]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:20:21.253 --> 01:20:21.774]  We're good to go!
[01:20:50.052 --> 01:20:51.328]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:20:53.675 --> 01:20:55.877]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:20:56.317 --> 01:21:00.680]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:21:00.941 --> 01:21:06.745]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:21:06.985 --> 01:21:11.048]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:21:11.328 --> 01:21:16.973]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[01:21:17.093 --> 01:21:19.695]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:21:21.796 --> 01:21:25.318]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 now.
[01:21:25.439 --> 01:21:28.120]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[01:21:28.461 --> 01:21:30.742]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[01:21:31.142 --> 01:21:34.765]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[01:21:35.245 --> 01:21:41.429]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[01:21:41.889 --> 01:21:42.890]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:21:43.210 --> 01:21:43.651]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:43.711 --> 01:21:43.911]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:54.514 --> 01:21:59.998]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:22:00.418 --> 01:22:04.641]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:22:04.881 --> 01:22:11.926]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:22:12.307 --> 01:22:18.411]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:22:18.551 --> 01:22:19.752]  There are no side effects.
[01:22:20.092 --> 01:22:23.054]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:22:23.194 --> 01:22:25.235]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:22:25.535 --> 01:22:32.779]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:22:33.059 --> 01:22:36.441]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:22:36.881 --> 01:22:41.545]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time that's 866-885-6625 call today!
[01:22:57.790 --> 01:23:03.213]  Alright, I promise in the next segment callers, here in about 10 minutes, we'll go directly to your calls.
[01:23:03.474 --> 01:23:08.857]  We've got Glenn Spencer, and during the break I was talking to him, he's going to send me a video of this so I can show it in Austin television.
[01:23:10.218 --> 01:23:14.461]  Because there's a news blackout on this, it's been in the newspaper and on TV there in Tucson, but that's it.
[01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:17.345]  This is very serious news.
[01:23:17.385 --> 01:23:18.986]  You got a call from Nightline.
[01:23:19.767 --> 01:23:22.228]  Tell them, Glenn, about the Nightline phone call.
[01:23:22.608 --> 01:23:26.851]  Well, the first time we did this, you know, last week, they called me up.
[01:23:26.931 --> 01:23:29.672]  One of the producers said, well, this is interesting.
[01:23:30.693 --> 01:23:35.116]  But the first time we did it, we got past the Border Patrol.
[01:23:35.356 --> 01:23:38.378]  We reached and met our load vehicle, but he had come inland.
[01:23:38.878 --> 01:23:40.699]  I mean, down south from the major highway.
[01:23:42.027 --> 01:23:44.108]  Well, no, we'd like a more realistic test.
[01:23:44.128 --> 01:23:53.393]  You know, if you can make it all the way to the major highway and have them picked up at the major highway and then get it into a major city, that would interest us.
[01:23:53.914 --> 01:23:54.434]  So we did it.
[01:23:55.154 --> 01:23:57.196]  We haven't heard back from them.
[01:23:57.216 --> 01:24:00.878]  And I got a call from a reporter at the Arizona Republic.
[01:24:01.788 --> 01:24:03.029]  And gave them all the details.
[01:24:03.049 --> 01:24:04.811]  I haven't seen anything in the newspaper.
[01:24:05.331 --> 01:24:06.272]  They haven't been calling.
[01:24:06.512 --> 01:24:11.536]  This is so incredibly vital and such a wonderful illustration of this horror.
[01:24:12.337 --> 01:24:14.899]  But, I mean, this is made for TV.
[01:24:14.959 --> 01:24:18.702]  Taking the dummy nuke to the federal courthouse in Tucson.
[01:24:19.723 --> 01:24:31.032]  And, again, I tell you, it's... Well, I think what we're going to do next is we're taking it into a shopping mall.
[01:24:32.851 --> 01:24:34.712]  And that should reach the American people.
[01:24:35.113 --> 01:24:38.775]  They probably don't care if somebody blew up the federal building.
[01:24:40.416 --> 01:24:41.657]  Just think about this, Alex.
[01:24:41.757 --> 01:24:42.437]  Just think about it.
[01:24:43.598 --> 01:24:51.543]  Anytime anybody wants to smuggle a weapon, a bomb, in from Mexico,
[01:24:52.336 --> 01:24:52.997]  They can do it.
[01:24:53.377 --> 01:24:56.739]  Well, listen, listen.
[01:24:56.839 --> 01:25:04.705]  A suitcase full of sarin, which everybody's got, a suitcase full of sarin in a subway or in a shopping mall will kill thousands of people.
[01:25:05.245 --> 01:25:05.445]  Right.
[01:25:06.006 --> 01:25:08.087]  And so, you know, forget just suitcase nukes.
[01:25:08.547 --> 01:25:15.632]  Maybe with this dummy test, you know, fake drill, you could drive the thing all the way over the border into D.C.
[01:25:16.033 --> 01:25:17.894]  and then dance around in front of the Capitol with it.
[01:25:17.934 --> 01:25:19.015]  Maybe that'll get their attention.
[01:25:19.475 --> 01:25:20.636]  No question about it.
[01:25:21.546 --> 01:25:29.410]  Once we make it under the interstate, you can go anywhere in the country with this thing.
[01:25:29.670 --> 01:25:30.750]  Just understand this.
[01:25:31.511 --> 01:25:36.433]  There is not one mall in the United States that can be protected.
[01:25:41.377 --> 01:25:46.721]  Literally, my guys tell me they can do this a thousand times.
[01:25:47.161 --> 01:25:48.002]  Look, this is the point.
[01:25:48.042 --> 01:25:55.167]  They're telling cops, put barbed wire around your courthouses, search the people, treat us like dogs, take our liberties as citizens.
[01:25:56.107 --> 01:26:03.913]  But then every day I see an article on your site mainstream where some sheriff arrests a busload of illegals and they're told release them.
[01:26:03.993 --> 01:26:04.553]  That's correct.
[01:26:04.573 --> 01:26:09.136]  But then I violate, the Supreme Court says I don't answer their questions I get arrested.
[01:26:09.376 --> 01:26:11.558]  As a citizen, I have less rights.
[01:26:11.778 --> 01:26:14.540]  This just shows all this fear mongering, all this scare mongering.
[01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:16.622]  It's for politics, it's to get our liberties.
[01:26:16.942 --> 01:26:19.444]  It has nothing to do with controlling our border.
[01:26:20.785 --> 01:26:21.265]  Well Alex,
[01:26:21.986 --> 01:26:26.949]  I don't know how else you can just, you know, we do this, we can do this every day.
[01:26:26.969 --> 01:26:33.172]  The last time we did this, you know, Monday evening, we started out a little earlier.
[01:26:33.192 --> 01:26:36.014]  The guys followed this riverbed.
[01:26:36.835 --> 01:26:38.135]  They went, they headed south.
[01:26:39.536 --> 01:26:46.200]  And what they normally do is when they reach the barbed wire fence, which is the border, that's when they turn around and start back.
[01:26:46.707 --> 01:26:50.008]  Well, they never found the barbed wire fence because there was no fence.
[01:26:50.288 --> 01:26:57.431]  They actually had to use their GPS to realize they were 100 yards or so into Mexico because there's no barrier there.
[01:26:57.471 --> 01:26:58.612]  Now, it was still light.
[01:26:58.632 --> 01:27:00.072]  It was 730 in the evening.
[01:27:00.872 --> 01:27:03.293]  And they then walked north.
[01:27:03.653 --> 01:27:04.774]  All of this is on tape.
[01:27:05.374 --> 01:27:07.195]  We didn't even have to use the night camera.
[01:27:07.755 --> 01:27:09.296]  And they walked right into the U.S.
[01:27:09.376 --> 01:27:10.196]  and brought daylight.
[01:27:10.911 --> 01:27:13.432]  Now, how many miles into Mexico did you go again?
[01:27:13.532 --> 01:27:14.632]  Well, we didn't go very far.
[01:27:14.812 --> 01:27:17.193]  Only probably a max of a couple of hundred yards.
[01:27:18.294 --> 01:27:24.816]  But, we were, they didn't intend to do that because they normally, there's a small barbed wire fence.
[01:27:25.356 --> 01:27:30.078]  But in this area, for a couple of hundred feet in either direction, there was no fence.
[01:27:30.298 --> 01:27:30.838]  There's nothing.
[01:27:31.978 --> 01:27:32.318]  Nothing.
[01:27:32.939 --> 01:27:33.579]  You could drive a
[01:27:34.574 --> 01:27:37.195]  You could drive a RV through there.
[01:27:37.335 --> 01:27:38.936]  They've had sensors since Vietnam.
[01:27:38.956 --> 01:27:41.017]  They've got cameras in my neighborhood, Glenn.
[01:27:41.458 --> 01:27:44.179]  Every small town in Texas has cameras all over it now.
[01:27:44.659 --> 01:27:46.360]  They could put up a 20-foot fence.
[01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:49.482]  They could put up cameras with infrared.
[01:27:49.882 --> 01:27:52.503]  They could end the illegal invasion.
[01:27:52.903 --> 01:27:55.225]  They could end the destruction of jobs.
[01:27:55.285 --> 01:27:58.106]  They could protect us from their so-called terrorist threat.
[01:27:58.326 --> 01:28:00.247]  But they have no intention of doing it.
[01:28:00.467 --> 01:28:01.728]  And this hot story
[01:28:02.276 --> 01:28:03.976]  This should be all over the newspapers.
[01:28:04.516 --> 01:28:06.137]  There's zero discussion of it.
[01:28:06.357 --> 01:28:06.997]  That is correct.
[01:28:08.197 --> 01:28:29.241]  Now, what we have decided to do, after doing this, uh, see, when you say, yes, they can do this, they have the technology to do this, uh, just as we prove very dramatically and very graphically that the weapons of mass destruction can be, uh, brought into the United States at will, we are also
[01:28:30.302 --> 01:28:39.871]  We're going to prove very graphically and very dramatically that the technology exists to close down that border.
[01:28:40.952 --> 01:28:41.433]  Stay there!
[01:28:41.473 --> 01:28:42.774]  We'll be right back and take calls.
[01:28:43.935 --> 01:28:44.876]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.337 --> 01:28:46.958]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.859 --> 01:28:50.542]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.264 --> 01:28:55.265]  It's finally here!
[01:28:55.405 --> 01:28:56.366]  Spring has arrived!
[01:28:56.566 --> 01:28:59.529]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:28:59.749 --> 01:29:03.212]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:29:03.432 --> 01:29:11.579]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[01:29:11.839 --> 01:29:15.582]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.

[01:29:21.087 --> 01:29:25.571]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[01:29:25.771 --> 01:29:29.835]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.

[01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:59.126]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:29:59.266 --> 01:30:07.376]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:30:07.616 --> 01:30:14.684]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:30:14.864 --> 01:30:16.125]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:30:16.225 --> 01:30:22.111]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:30:22.311 --> 01:30:27.396]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:30:27.516 --> 01:30:36.345]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.

[01:32:13.903 --> 01:32:28.293]  Folks, the global corporations that control the Democrats and the Republicans don't want to discuss the open borders, the Pan-American Union, the Union of American States, the end of our sovereignty.
[01:32:29.674 --> 01:32:36.179]  Their own policy reports say they want to drop down the wages to subsistence, they want to get rid of the middle class regardless of what color you are.
[01:32:37.671 --> 01:32:47.878]  And so that's why they don't want to discuss it when major polls show 80 plus percent of Americans, regardless of color, know that the open borders are a security threat, and more importantly, an economic threat.
[01:32:49.119 --> 01:32:51.300]  We can't take on the whole third world, people!
[01:32:52.881 --> 01:32:53.342]  It's simple.
[01:32:53.382 --> 01:32:55.923]  We can't absorb five million people a year.
[01:32:57.124 --> 01:33:01.027]  At its height, it was a couple hundred thousand back at the turn of the last century, and that's fine.
[01:33:01.067 --> 01:33:02.448]  It's what makes America, America.
[01:33:03.428 --> 01:33:04.169]  But the government
[01:33:05.268 --> 01:33:07.870]  Glenn, we were talking during the break, and we're going to go to some calls here.
[01:33:09.411 --> 01:33:11.973]  I mean, I was saying you should be on every radio show, every TV show.
[01:33:12.013 --> 01:33:16.497]  This is major news, but as you said, they're running around turning off all the news valves.
[01:33:16.697 --> 01:33:19.279]  Both parties don't want to talk about this, do they?
[01:33:19.799 --> 01:33:20.460]  Tell us all about it.
[01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:21.481]  Correct.
[01:33:21.501 --> 01:33:22.341]  The call went out.
[01:33:22.982 --> 01:33:30.167]  They shut this down, and there are just a few, you know, sources out there that the American people have, and you're one of them.
[01:33:31.168 --> 01:33:33.390]  All the rest, they're going to shut down on this thing.
[01:33:33.410 --> 01:33:34.931]  They're going to throw a blanket over it.
[01:33:37.554 --> 01:33:41.897]  They don't want this issue debated in this election, in this presidential campaign.
[01:33:42.738 --> 01:33:55.926]  They don't want the people to know that John Kerry's national co-chairman of his campaign, Antonio Villarigosa, and we have absolute airtight proof of this, is an agent of Mexico.
[01:33:56.747 --> 01:33:58.108]  These are the things that they don't want.
[01:33:58.188 --> 01:33:59.149]  Well, let me stop you.
[01:33:59.269 --> 01:34:03.952]  Rick Perry in Texas, you know, when Vicente Fox came to town, I actually shut down their press conference.
[01:34:05.191 --> 01:34:18.765]  And, uh, I know you linked to those news stories about that, but it turns out that Rick Perry's head of Texas-Mexico Affairs is a Mexican citizen and a registered lobbyist of the Mexican government.
[01:34:19.166 --> 01:34:20.107]  I mean, that's illegal!
[01:34:20.712 --> 01:34:32.961]  And then the activists in Houston who got those documents with a FOIA request for the state open records, which was public documents, she was threatened with arrest if she didn't turn the documents back in and promise not to talk about it anymore.
[01:34:34.542 --> 01:34:43.868]  And then we have Vicente Fox here giving awards to the City of Austin Police and to the Republican Party and others for not following the federal law.
[01:34:44.108 --> 01:34:45.449]  Can you speak to both those issues?
[01:34:45.970 --> 01:34:49.032]  Well, look, it is so clear.
[01:34:49.591 --> 01:35:08.167]  That the Mexican government is lobbying, they have, in every one of their consulates, actively works to defeat every one of our laws, to advance the cause of the Mexican invasion, and they are aided and abetted by our own elected officials!
[01:35:08.887 --> 01:35:16.213]  I mean, this is one of the most incredible developments conceivable, and yet, they get away with it.
[01:35:17.308 --> 01:35:19.209]  We know that Kerry's bad.
[01:35:20.150 --> 01:35:26.573]  Bush said that the biggest amnesty ever, that would even pay to bring illegals here, was not an amnesty.
[01:35:26.893 --> 01:35:29.335]  Where is Bush now on that ridiculous statement?
[01:35:29.555 --> 01:35:30.735]  Well, he's backed off.
[01:35:32.016 --> 01:35:39.840]  And, you know, we're on a campaign to force the President to enforce the laws, the immigration laws.
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:44.683]  We believe that if we can force him to do that, we will save him from himself.
[01:35:45.303 --> 01:35:46.384]  He will be re-elected.
[01:35:47.188 --> 01:36:01.820]  And so we may have to drag Mr. Bush kicking and screaming back into the White House, because if we can force him to enforce the laws, once again I believe the people will vote for him.
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:16.032]  And if we can force this issue onto the main stage, and people begin to look at John Kerry and who his wife is, and that she has financed the National Lawyers Guild, one of the worst
[01:36:17.674 --> 01:36:25.278]  Left-wing, open borders, formerly communist organizations in the country, and she finances it.
[01:36:25.838 --> 01:36:33.182]  I mean, if the truth were known about that gang on the Kerry side, America should be frightened.
[01:36:33.282 --> 01:36:36.043]  Well, look at Bush, though, and I've had Tom Jancredo on.
[01:36:36.083 --> 01:36:38.965]  Bush has said, we're targeting to get him out of office.
[01:36:38.985 --> 01:36:42.487]  I mean, we've got Bush targeting the only good Republicans we've got.
[01:36:42.507 --> 01:36:43.287]  That's correct.
[01:36:43.808 --> 01:36:44.408]  That's correct.
[01:36:45.755 --> 01:36:48.396]  Well again, Bush is taking his corporate orders.
[01:36:48.456 --> 01:36:55.197]  I mean, we have to, Glenn, people need to understand, this is New York, this is London, this is the big brokerage houses.
[01:36:55.578 --> 01:36:57.038]  They want a Pan-American Union.
[01:36:57.678 --> 01:37:08.261]  And they want to use, you know, when our nationalism is bad, but Mexican nationalism is good to them, they want to use that to break off the Southwest as kind of like a Montreal, you know, French Canada situation.
[01:37:08.921 --> 01:37:09.601]  Well, absolutely.
[01:37:09.621 --> 01:37:12.522]  It is the big corporate powers that's who run the world today.
[01:37:12.822 --> 01:37:13.282]  We know that.
[01:37:14.522 --> 01:37:18.224]  But the only problem they have is that Mexico isn't going to go along with the joke.
[01:37:18.624 --> 01:37:22.506]  If they think that they're going to merge Mexico with anybody, they're absolutely wrong.
[01:37:23.006 --> 01:37:28.349]  Mexico is interested in annexing the American Southwest and placing it under its jurisdiction.
[01:37:28.509 --> 01:37:36.413]  Well, to give folks an idea of how corrupt Mexico is, Glenn, they have more billionaires and less middle class than any other country in the world.
[01:37:37.239 --> 01:37:45.802]  And that's ill-gotten, and now their judicial branch had to take microchips two weeks ago to get in the building, and now they're talking about making their cops take microchips!
[01:37:46.162 --> 01:37:47.603]  What type of neighbor is that?
[01:37:47.803 --> 01:37:52.384]  Well, you know, we can say things, I can say things, and you can say things, and people might discount it.
[01:37:52.824 --> 01:38:03.208]  But did you know I have a videotape of a C-SPAN presentation by the World Bank, and their analysis of the effect of NAFTA, and their chief economist,
[01:38:03.752 --> 01:38:06.393]  Asked, why isn't Mexico advancing?
[01:38:06.433 --> 01:38:21.736]  And they did this study, in-depth study, the World Bank Chief Economist, and the reason he said Mexico doesn't advance is their number one, their failure to adhere to the rule of law, and number two, corruption.
[01:38:22.996 --> 01:38:32.378]  Which we would not discuss in the NAFTA negotiations, even though Senator Patrick Moynihan tried to get the Senate to take up the issue of
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:40.983]  of Mexican corruption, and it is why NAFTA has failed, and it is why they have all of those billionaires down there.
[01:38:41.603 --> 01:38:45.584]  And people knew it at the time NAFTA was being proposed.
[01:38:45.964 --> 01:38:51.686]  Some people tried to speak out and warn the people that this is not going to work, but they weren't listened to.
[01:38:51.706 --> 01:38:53.067]  All right?
[01:38:53.407 --> 01:38:54.287]  They weren't listened to.
[01:38:55.267 --> 01:38:57.028]  And the same thing is happening now.
[01:38:57.428 --> 01:38:59.669]  But you see, the thing is, you have to understand.
[01:39:00.382 --> 01:39:09.907]  That the power structure is more than happy to permit massive corruption in Mexico as long as they can open the border.
[01:39:10.127 --> 01:39:10.487]  I agree.
[01:39:10.527 --> 01:39:11.468]  Let's take some calls.
[01:39:11.528 --> 01:39:12.548]  I appreciate everybody holding.
[01:39:12.568 --> 01:39:14.549]  I know you're on a whole host of issues.
[01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:16.370]  Who's up first here, Stephanie?
[01:39:18.872 --> 01:39:19.792]  David in New York.
[01:39:19.812 --> 01:39:21.753]  You're on the air with Alex Jones and Glenn Spencer.
[01:39:21.773 --> 01:39:23.634]  Glenn Spencer with AmericanPatrol.com.
[01:39:23.654 --> 01:39:24.034]  Go ahead.
[01:39:24.855 --> 01:39:25.115]  Hi, Alex.
[01:39:25.355 --> 01:39:25.595]  Glenn.
[01:39:26.035 --> 01:39:26.716]  Hey, Glenn.
[01:39:27.441 --> 01:39:30.902]  Yes, your experiences are further evidence that the War on Terror is a total scam.
[01:39:32.963 --> 01:39:35.664]  Well, anyway, I wanted to call about two quick things.
[01:39:35.744 --> 01:39:50.710]  One of them was, I was just visiting StopTheFTA.org, and I was looking at, you know, the Rose Gallery, and it turns out that David Rockefeller was behind many of the organizations behind
[01:39:52.108 --> 01:39:56.670]  Yeah, Glenn, Clay Spencer is an expert on this, David.
[01:39:56.690 --> 01:40:06.274]  I'll let you comment in a second, but if you read the Tax-Free Foundations 50 years ago, they planned to use third-world populations to break down the U.S.
[01:40:06.474 --> 01:40:11.155]  And the Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Brothers Foundation, they're behind this.
[01:40:11.476 --> 01:40:12.476]  Glenn, tell us about it.
[01:40:12.796 --> 01:40:16.237]  Well, certainly they're behind it, but let's also remember one thing.
[01:40:16.658 --> 01:40:19.599]  You know, Mexico spent $50 million
[01:40:21.107 --> 01:40:23.308]  Lobbying Congress to get NAFTA passed.
[01:40:23.908 --> 01:40:25.709]  Fifty million dollars.
[01:40:27.410 --> 01:40:32.632]  The Clinton administration's trade negotiator sold us down the river.
[01:40:33.652 --> 01:40:35.073]  There's no question about that.
[01:40:36.673 --> 01:40:39.134]  But, once again, it's not going to be reported.
[01:40:39.334 --> 01:40:42.376]  And Al Gore got up on TV and told us how great it was going to be.
[01:40:42.836 --> 01:40:43.416]  That's correct.
[01:40:43.436 --> 01:40:45.257]  Milk and honey was going to flow through the streets.
[01:40:45.297 --> 01:40:46.177]  I'm sorry, go ahead, David.
[01:40:47.338 --> 01:40:50.259]  And the really odd thing I found was that David Rockefeller even wrote a
[01:40:51.415 --> 01:41:02.326]  I have on tape many of the hearings, the NAFTA hearings.
[01:41:03.347 --> 01:41:11.956]  I even have a debate between Senator Graham of Texas and then-Governor Brown, Jerry Brown of California.
[01:41:12.076 --> 01:41:12.997]  Interestingly enough,
[01:41:13.579 --> 01:41:21.024]  Everything that Jerry Brown said about NAFTA was right, and everything that Senator Graham claimed about NAFTA turned out to be wrong.
[01:41:21.064 --> 01:41:25.268]  Well, yeah, Jerry Brown is the conservative compared to Graham, and I'm not joking.
[01:41:26.048 --> 01:41:27.709]  You know, Graham is a very honest fellow.
[01:41:28.450 --> 01:41:28.810]  He what?
[01:41:29.070 --> 01:41:30.411]  He's a very honest man.
[01:41:30.771 --> 01:41:31.432]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:41:31.472 --> 01:41:32.913]  That's why he's out of the Democratic Party.
[01:41:33.113 --> 01:41:33.553]  You're right.
[01:41:33.573 --> 01:41:35.155]  It's because he won't play patty-cake.
[01:41:36.115 --> 01:41:37.076]  Let's, uh, thank you, David.
[01:41:37.116 --> 01:41:37.616]  Great points.
[01:41:37.977 --> 01:41:38.917]  Melissa in Texas.
[01:41:38.957 --> 01:41:39.678]  Melissa, go ahead.
[01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:45.390]  Melissa, you're on the air.
[01:41:45.410 --> 01:41:47.291]  Okay, she's gone.
[01:41:47.531 --> 01:41:49.032]  Gloria in Rhode Island.
[01:41:49.072 --> 01:41:50.153]  Gloria, you're on the air.
[01:41:50.233 --> 01:41:50.653]  Go ahead.
[01:41:52.134 --> 01:41:52.575]  Hi, Alex.
[01:41:52.755 --> 01:41:53.475]  Hello, Gloria.
[01:41:54.095 --> 01:41:55.656]  Thank you, Alex, for everything you do.
[01:41:56.157 --> 01:41:59.419]  Every day, every night, every morning, every minute of the day.
[01:41:59.439 --> 01:42:00.039]  Well, thank you.
[01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:10.966]  Alex, when I listened to former Clinton's remarks to the Democratic convention the other night, I sat there and I said, okay, let me listen, let me listen.
[01:42:10.986 --> 01:42:11.806]  I'm just listening.
[01:42:11.866 --> 01:42:12.647]  It doesn't mean a thing.
[01:42:13.342 --> 01:42:15.344]  However, it was something that struck me.
[01:42:15.704 --> 01:42:22.811]  So I went to the Washington Post, I pulled it up on the computer, and I have the text of his speech.
[01:42:23.652 --> 01:42:26.615]  In part of the text, he refers to the Vietnam War.
[01:42:27.776 --> 01:42:37.946]  And three quarters of the way through his speech, he says, and I want to quote it, it's only a few sentences, he says, verbatim, during the Vietnam War,
[01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:47.224]  Many young men, including the current president, the vice president, and me, could have gone to Vietnam and didn't.
[01:42:48.164 --> 01:42:51.025]  John Kerry came from a privileged background.
[01:42:52.106 --> 01:42:56.327]  He could have avoided going too, but instead he said, send me.
[01:42:56.988 --> 01:43:07.112]  What we have, Alex, according to the interpretation I get from that, is a former sitting president, recently sitting, telling this nation
[01:43:07.813 --> 01:43:11.695]  That if you came from privilege, you don't have to be drafted in this country.
[01:43:13.196 --> 01:43:14.397]  Well, everybody knows that.
[01:43:14.457 --> 01:43:15.598]  Glenn Spencer comments.
[01:43:16.398 --> 01:43:25.964]  Well, you know, I am not going to... I believe that Kerry, he did go to Vietnam voluntarily.
[01:43:27.216 --> 01:43:34.200]  And then he brought a camera and then turned in Purple Hearts for scratches and stuff.
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:35.981]  Basically a propaganda stunt.
[01:43:36.281 --> 01:43:41.383]  Well, apparently it was that, but let's be honest with ourselves.
[01:43:42.544 --> 01:43:49.187]  Those fast boats in the Mekong Delta were not the safest place to be.
[01:43:49.307 --> 01:43:49.928]  No, I agree.
[01:43:51.212 --> 01:43:53.673]  Well, you've got to give him some credit for that, you know?
[01:43:54.113 --> 01:43:55.494]  Yeah, he took advantage of it.
[01:43:55.534 --> 01:43:59.316]  He saw the political advantage of his position.
[01:43:59.336 --> 01:44:06.219]  No, I have to say, compared to all the chicken hawks, you know, these neocons, but again, it's all a diversion.
[01:44:06.739 --> 01:44:09.140]  Kerry isn't even going to run anything if he's elected.
[01:44:09.180 --> 01:44:12.181]  He's a puppet, and so is Bush and these corporations.
[01:44:12.721 --> 01:44:14.782]  Well, but that's not where I'm coming from, Alex.
[01:44:15.022 --> 01:44:18.184]  Where I'm coming from is, yes, John Kerry did go voluntarily.
[01:44:18.644 --> 01:44:20.625]  However, we have a president who is
[01:44:20.953 --> 01:44:25.355]  Who is actually saying right out there, and as you say all the time, Alex, they say it right to you.
[01:44:25.655 --> 01:44:26.636]  You're just not listening.
[01:44:27.176 --> 01:44:32.619]  They say, and he said, if you come from a background of privilege, you didn't have to go.
[01:44:32.639 --> 01:44:33.900]  That's correct.
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:37.262]  That's a very good point, and I heard you say that, and I understood what you were saying.
[01:44:37.402 --> 01:44:38.762]  I understood too, Gloria.
[01:44:38.802 --> 01:44:39.543]  Thanks for the call.
[01:44:39.583 --> 01:44:42.204]  You can pull strings, and you can do anything you want.
[01:44:42.945 --> 01:44:46.426]  Now, I don't know if there's been a statistical analysis of that that would hold water.
[01:44:46.446 --> 01:44:46.747]  I don't know.
[01:44:50.094 --> 01:44:52.736]  All right, let's talk to Johnny in Hawaii.
[01:44:52.876 --> 01:44:53.617]  Johnny, go ahead.
[01:44:53.637 --> 01:44:54.797]  Yeah, thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:44:54.837 --> 01:44:58.880]  Yeah, I just want to report a couple of things going on here in Hawaii.
[01:44:59.621 --> 01:45:01.342]  We have our own illegal aid problem.
[01:45:01.362 --> 01:45:06.205]  We have illegal aid coming in from Samoa, China, and the Philippines.
[01:45:06.546 --> 01:45:08.507]  So that's one of our problems here.
[01:45:08.527 --> 01:45:11.990]  Another problem is there's a government land grab going on here.
[01:45:12.010 --> 01:45:17.493]  The city and county government is trying to take over all the farmers' land.
[01:45:18.374 --> 01:45:19.595]  That's happening everywhere.
[01:45:20.046 --> 01:45:22.168]  Yeah, what they've done is raise their tax bill.
[01:45:22.868 --> 01:45:29.534]  And this has been in the news for a week over here, but for instance, a farmer said his tax bill last year was $2,500.
[01:45:30.214 --> 01:45:32.176]  This year it's $350,000.
[01:45:33.257 --> 01:45:34.197]  So he has to sell.
[01:45:34.958 --> 01:45:40.082]  And what I can see happening is... Let me guess, they put in electronic voting machines and now suddenly this is happening?
[01:45:41.919 --> 01:45:44.701]  They may do that in the next election here, that's for sure.
[01:45:45.141 --> 01:45:51.964]  Well that shows, I mean, listen, I've had my property tax bill triple in one year while property values actually go down.
[01:45:51.984 --> 01:45:53.744]  I mean, it's just pell-mell.
[01:45:55.225 --> 01:45:56.825]  Glenn Spencer, comments about this?
[01:45:57.626 --> 01:46:05.449]  Well, you know, what we have seen with these national monuments that Clinton turned into national parks,
[01:46:06.718 --> 01:46:13.179]  The use of the National Monument provision in the law to essentially confiscate land.
[01:46:13.839 --> 01:46:15.340]  I believe this is going on everywhere.
[01:46:16.700 --> 01:46:19.240]  I think what's going to happen is that they're just going to hold the land for a while.
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:23.881]  They'll turn it over to some of their big-buddy realtors and get a kickback.
[01:46:23.981 --> 01:46:24.801]  They always know.
[01:46:24.841 --> 01:46:26.162]  That's how the scam works.
[01:46:26.222 --> 01:46:26.642]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:26.822 --> 01:46:31.523]  Another thing we've got is the Carlisle Group is buying out Verizon here for $1.6 billion.
[01:46:34.734 --> 01:46:40.842]  They're buying up everything, movie chains, radio chains.
[01:46:41.102 --> 01:46:42.283]  Thanks for the call, Johnny.
[01:46:43.064 --> 01:46:44.766]  John in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:46:44.806 --> 01:46:45.467]  Go ahead, John.
[01:46:46.509 --> 01:46:47.910]  Yes, Alex.
[01:46:48.912 --> 01:46:50.153]  I sometimes have to cheer.
[01:46:51.297 --> 01:46:55.040]  I heard some things today that really disturbed me and I think there's a real danger among conservatives like yourself
[01:47:07.257 --> 01:47:20.109]  When people call in and begin red-baiting using the old Cold War anti-communist red-baiting pretext for colonial wars abroad and repression at home.
[01:47:20.169 --> 01:47:22.171]  Hey, John, John, you've called before.
[01:47:22.211 --> 01:47:23.132]  I know you're a socialist.
[01:47:23.152 --> 01:47:23.652]  You've told us.
[01:47:23.712 --> 01:47:24.553]  Let me explain something to you.
[01:47:25.399 --> 01:47:30.121]  The big money finances and controls both sides as long as it's command and control.
[01:47:30.502 --> 01:47:32.803]  I don't know how you cannot figure that out.
[01:47:33.263 --> 01:47:37.165]  The communists are in Iraq supporting the coalition right now.
[01:47:37.185 --> 01:47:39.286]  Let me point out something to you though.
[01:47:39.366 --> 01:47:42.368]  Those communists are totally non-communist sellouts.
[01:47:42.408 --> 01:47:50.472]  They've been condemned by every socialist and communist group in the world for selling out just as the others have sold out.
[01:47:50.994 --> 01:48:04.745]  The American Communist Party that this earlier caller was mentioning was actually split from by all the honest socialists and communists because they always take this kind of lesser evil attitude that they have their unwanted
[01:48:05.604 --> 01:48:17.472]  uh... endorsement of the uh... uh... democratic lesser lesser evil and everyone... John, John, John, I think you should do a TV show yourself and if you don't want to put my videos on TV because we don't agree on some things, that's fine.
[01:48:17.812 --> 01:48:22.455]  But I think it's dumb for you to not put my films on TV because we agree on some things.
[01:48:22.495 --> 01:48:24.056]  I don't agree on the form of government you want.
[01:48:24.396 --> 01:48:30.160]  I agree this current government is what you'd call fascistic, using socialistic systems to confiscate our wealth.
[01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:32.421]  And then put it into the fascist pipeline.
[01:48:32.461 --> 01:48:33.462]  Glenn Spencer, comments?
[01:48:33.942 --> 01:48:42.466]  Well, you know, I mentioned the Communist Party because, you know, they're very active out here, rather, out in California.
[01:48:42.486 --> 01:48:55.974]  You know, Senator Alarcon, who's a state senator in California, his sister was head of the Communist Party USA for Southern California, and she was the one who pushed through the
[01:49:01.109 --> 01:49:06.851]  The Cesar Chavez California holiday that was all organized by the Communist Party!
[01:49:07.191 --> 01:49:08.572]  They're still alive!
[01:49:09.272 --> 01:49:15.695]  Look here, you're calling for the re-election of a man who has killed and slaughtered people, Bush, around the world.
[01:49:15.755 --> 01:49:19.196]  A man who is going to institute police state measures in this country.
[01:49:19.637 --> 01:49:23.418]  This is opposed by every socialist, every leftist, every communist.
[01:49:23.738 --> 01:49:26.299]  I would at least... I'm not advocating the re-election of Bush.
[01:49:26.519 --> 01:49:27.700]  You have said that...
[01:49:28.359 --> 01:49:36.482]  You have said that if you can then at least bring him a run on this issue, this will manipulate... No, no, I'm just saying... Hey, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what.
[01:49:36.802 --> 01:49:39.203]  Glenn Spencer's got an audio clip he's gonna play, two more calls.
[01:49:39.563 --> 01:49:40.183]  Stay there, John.
[01:49:40.203 --> 01:49:42.264]  We'll let you and Glenn hash this out.
[01:49:42.664 --> 01:49:48.206]  When we get back, Glenn Spencer's our guest, doing a great job exposing our wide-open borders, and I appreciate him for it.
[01:49:48.526 --> 01:49:50.207]  But you get your say, John, when we get back.
[01:49:53.937 --> 01:49:55.439]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.599 --> 01:49:58.682]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.822 --> 01:50:02.725]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.765 --> 01:50:07.010]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:11.133]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.274 --> 01:50:13.115]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:13.255 --> 01:50:16.599]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[01:50:16.639 --> 01:50:17.720]  The medical bills!
[01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:21.301]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.481 --> 01:50:24.522]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.702 --> 01:50:27.563]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:28.043 --> 01:50:34.165]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.705 --> 01:50:38.490]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:53:05.456 --> 01:53:08.777]  Then I'll get into having to have a microchip to go to the hospital.
[01:53:10.177 --> 01:53:12.138]  Just all this other news we haven't detailed yet.
[01:53:13.318 --> 01:53:15.879]  We're about to go back to John in Ohio.
[01:53:15.919 --> 01:53:18.119]  Then we'll go back to Melissa, John in Tennessee.
[01:53:19.800 --> 01:53:20.940]  Just a bunch of other people.
[01:53:21.593 --> 01:53:22.593]  that are patiently holding.

[01:53:24.754 --> 01:53:25.314]  I've written a book.
[01:53:25.374 --> 01:53:26.114]  I've published a book.
[01:53:26.714 --> 01:53:32.996]  I carry a bunch of other videos and books by great researchers that exposes global crime syndicate.
[01:53:34.677 --> 01:53:39.798]  And I hope you'll visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and peruse the shopping cart.

[01:54:14.790 --> 01:54:20.614]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:54:22.816 --> 01:54:33.084]  Now, I want to point out that Glenn has documented twice that you can have something marked nuclear weapon, carry it in and out of the U.S., carry it into major cities, and the media is ignoring this.
[01:54:33.144 --> 01:54:35.686]  And Glenn's doing a good job exposing that.
[01:54:35.746 --> 01:54:38.808]  Now, John, who calls himself a socialist,
[01:54:39.931 --> 01:54:45.553]  is arguing with Glenn about some issues and John, Glenn, go ahead, talk to each other.
[01:54:45.693 --> 01:54:50.955]  Well, Alex, I had called to respond to an earlier caller before this guest came on.
[01:54:51.315 --> 01:55:04.180]  What I wanted to point out is that I think there's a real danger, a tragic danger, of people are doing such good work as you are doing that the anti-communist vulnerability, the Achilles heel, the profile that the
[01:55:05.064 --> 01:55:08.687]  These globalists can use to mobilize honest conservatives.
[01:55:08.827 --> 01:55:26.563]  If they put an anti-communist label on these wars for conquest and domination, if they can put a red-baiting label on it, that some honest conservatives who are adamantly opposed to these pushes for police, state, martial law in this country and empire abroad may fall for it.
[01:55:26.703 --> 01:55:29.245]  And I just feel that, you know, other
[01:55:29.784 --> 01:55:38.631]  Real socialist organizations like Workers.org, WSWS.org, who are running candidates, have no use for Democrats or Republicans.
[01:55:38.931 --> 01:55:40.372]  Well, let me stop you for a second.
[01:55:40.492 --> 01:55:41.633]  Let me stop you for a second.
[01:55:41.974 --> 01:55:42.194]  Yes.
[01:55:42.354 --> 01:55:52.402]  Okay, because we've argued before about these systems, and I totally disagree with you on that, but Glenn is saying that if Bush wouldn't sell out the border,
[01:55:53.183 --> 01:55:54.884]  That would probably get him re-elected.
[01:55:54.964 --> 01:55:56.145]  Why won't Bush do that?
[01:55:56.185 --> 01:55:58.927]  And we said because he's elite-controlled, just like Kerry.
[01:55:59.187 --> 01:56:01.008]  I mean, I agree with what Glenn Spencer's saying.
[01:56:01.088 --> 01:56:02.829]  I wish Bush would do something about the borders.
[01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:06.431]  That's part of the corporate plan, John, is to get rid of our borders.
[01:56:07.252 --> 01:56:07.772]  Go ahead, Glenn.
[01:56:08.514 --> 01:56:09.015]  Absolutely.
[01:56:09.035 --> 01:56:15.602]  I don't know who has justified the war in Iraq, which is the big issue today, on the basis that it's anti-communist.
[01:56:15.823 --> 01:56:17.184]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:56:17.224 --> 01:56:21.689]  No, I'm talking about an earlier caller who called in to... No, I don't have to worry about that.
[01:56:21.869 --> 01:56:22.750]  Redneck Kerry.
[01:56:22.850 --> 01:56:23.691]  Redneck Kerry.
[01:56:24.432 --> 01:56:28.517]  And, you know, the Communist Party has always taken this position of the lesser evil,
[01:56:28.911 --> 01:56:38.821]  And that's why so many actual communist associates have split from the Communist Party, because they have, in effect, colluded with the left-wing of the Democratic Party.
[01:56:38.841 --> 01:56:39.802]  OK, John, take care.
[01:56:39.962 --> 01:56:41.684]  Listen, thanks for the call.
[01:56:41.704 --> 01:56:42.364]  Let me just say this.
[01:56:43.365 --> 01:56:47.750]  Your precious Communist Fourth International created the neocon.
[01:56:48.644 --> 01:56:50.946]  Created the people running the White House right now.
[01:56:51.646 --> 01:56:59.051]  All communism and socialism does is rot countries because it's command and control and thieves are always going to get into power.
[01:57:00.652 --> 01:57:01.693]  Glenn, comments to this?
[01:57:01.853 --> 01:57:04.034]  Well, by the way, let me just say something.
[01:57:04.674 --> 01:57:06.215]  If I can, I want to interject something.
[01:57:06.236 --> 01:57:14.461]  I just got a call while we're on break that our internet service provider has been threatened by Fox News.
[01:57:15.491 --> 01:57:18.752]  Uh, because we had some clips on there and we're taking them off.
[01:57:19.273 --> 01:57:22.134]  I just got a call that said they may take us off the air.
[01:57:22.194 --> 01:57:29.897]  They may knock AmericanPatrol.com, the most popular website in America on this issue, off the air.
[01:57:30.857 --> 01:57:32.518]  Oh, Fox is... That's correct.
[01:57:32.618 --> 01:57:34.319]  We know Fox is a tool of the globalists.
[01:57:34.339 --> 01:57:36.340]  They don't want that nuke footage on there, do they?
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:38.040]  Stay there, Glenn.
[01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:39.161]  We'll talk about it when we get back.
[01:57:39.641 --> 01:57:41.502]  We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[01:57:41.522 --> 01:57:41.922]  Stay with us.
[01:57:50.180 --> 01:57:50.840]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.481 --> 01:57:52.542]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.262 --> 01:57:54.363]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.023 --> 01:57:55.864]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.584 --> 01:57:57.505]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.525 --> 01:58:01.847]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.327 --> 01:58:06.470]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.771 --> 01:58:13.834]  By the way, in the past, Bill O'Reilly would talk about the border situation, the threat.
[01:58:14.235 --> 01:58:15.455]  Now he's for the amnesty.
[01:58:15.515 --> 01:58:16.316]  Now he loves it.
[01:58:17.890 --> 01:58:25.775]  Because that's what the establishment wants, and Glenn Spencer had some clips of that on his show from when he'd been on the show, and it's fair use, they're analyzing the media.
[01:58:27.136 --> 01:58:31.738]  And now Fox News is trying to get AmericanPatrol.com shut down, folks.
[01:58:32.339 --> 01:58:44.286]  And this is very interesting timing, this fight's been going on for months and months between O'Reilly and American Patrol, but now they've got this footage of sneaking in a fake nuke, it's their footage, suddenly this is kind of the excuse to go after them.
[01:58:44.626 --> 01:58:46.347]  That's what I would guess is behind this.
[01:58:46.387 --> 01:58:47.348]  Glenn Spencer, comments?
[01:58:48.204 --> 01:59:00.357]  Two days after we did the first caper, they contacted our internet service provider and said we had to take all of this stuff off of our website.
[01:59:00.397 --> 01:59:05.022]  We took some of it off, but we would have to stop doing anything else.
[01:59:05.963 --> 01:59:10.548]  Because over the years, we've been on the air for about 10 years on American Patrol,
[01:59:10.939 --> 01:59:13.761]  But we have a lot of little clips, little screen grabs.
[01:59:14.062 --> 01:59:16.964]  It's all covered under the Fair Use Doctrine of the Copyright Law.
[01:59:16.984 --> 01:59:18.746]  We're not violating their copyright.
[01:59:19.987 --> 01:59:22.869]  You know, the test is, are we depriving them of any income?
[01:59:22.969 --> 01:59:23.650]  Absolutely not.
[01:59:23.850 --> 01:59:25.051]  Are we making money off of it?
[01:59:25.271 --> 01:59:25.992]  Absolutely not.
[01:59:26.252 --> 01:59:28.394]  Is it factual versus artistic material?
[01:59:28.434 --> 01:59:29.675]  It's factual, right?
[01:59:30.035 --> 01:59:31.876]  And are we doing this in the public interest?
[01:59:32.037 --> 01:59:32.457]  Absolutely.
[01:59:32.884 --> 01:59:36.647]  We meet every test of the fair use doctrine of the copyright law.
[01:59:37.067 --> 01:59:43.392]  There is no violation of their copyright, but they're using their muscle to frighten our internet service provider.
[01:59:43.692 --> 01:59:47.054]  And I just got a note handed to me that they're going to knock us off the air.
[01:59:47.455 --> 01:59:53.599]  They take down AmericanPatrol.com, which is now featuring the smuggling of the weapons of mass destruction.
[01:59:53.679 --> 01:59:54.880]  And that's what goes on, folks.
[01:59:55.461 --> 01:59:56.582]  You see, they want the power.
[01:59:56.602 --> 01:59:59.264]  They do not want the American people to know the truth.
[01:59:59.645 --> 02:00:04.749]  They are going to... I have to get off here and try to see what I can do to stop this.
[02:00:05.490 --> 02:00:07.992]  But they are going to take us off the Internet!
[02:00:08.012 --> 02:00:11.415]  Because they don't want the American people to see this!
[02:00:11.595 --> 02:00:14.298]  You were going to stay with us, but I'm going to let you go so you can deal with this.
[02:00:14.558 --> 02:00:14.818]  Yeah.
[02:00:15.359 --> 02:00:19.282]  And, you know, I hope that you can email if you do get taken down.
[02:00:19.362 --> 02:00:22.565]  Send the files to other websites to try to mirror your site.
[02:00:23.362 --> 02:00:24.203]  Yeah.
[02:00:24.723 --> 02:00:26.524]  And, you know, hopefully a fight against this.
[02:00:26.564 --> 02:00:28.506]  But there you are, you're fair and balanced, people.
[02:00:29.366 --> 02:00:33.389]  They don't even want, what, images of when you've been on Fox TV?
[02:00:33.409 --> 02:00:34.290]  Just screenshots?
[02:00:34.330 --> 02:00:39.413]  Not even screen grabs, nothing showing anything on Fox TV, which is complete nonsense.
[02:00:39.693 --> 02:00:43.116]  They tried to do this with hundreds of other outlets and nobody's ever complained.
[02:00:43.136 --> 02:00:46.298]  They tried to sue Al Franken for just saying the word Fox.
[02:00:48.780 --> 02:00:49.620]  Well, there you are, folks.
[02:00:49.801 --> 02:00:50.221]  There you are.
[02:00:50.856 --> 02:00:52.696]  Well, just counter-assume, buddy.
[02:00:53.037 --> 02:00:53.237]  Yes.
[02:00:53.817 --> 02:00:57.478]  Of course, that'll waste your time if you try to expose how we're wide open to nuclear attack.
[02:00:57.738 --> 02:00:57.918]  Right.
[02:00:58.778 --> 02:00:59.418]  Alright, Glenn.
[02:00:59.518 --> 02:00:59.918]  Alright.
[02:01:00.158 --> 02:01:01.359]  AmericanPatrol.com.
[02:01:01.399 --> 02:01:03.779]  Folks, better get over there before they take us off the air.
[02:01:04.019 --> 02:01:04.940]  Alright, take care, my friend.
[02:01:04.980 --> 02:01:05.280]  Bye-bye.
[02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:09.601]  Well, we were going to have Glenn with us for some more, but he's in the middle of that right now.
[02:01:09.701 --> 02:01:10.861]  You see how this works, folks?
[02:01:10.901 --> 02:01:12.962]  Your good friend O'Reilly, your good friend Fox News.
[02:01:15.962 --> 02:01:17.943]  And again, this suddenly pops up because
[02:01:19.477 --> 02:01:23.699]  They are over there showing the nuke footage, how you can sneak nukes into the country.
[02:01:24.539 --> 02:01:26.180]  You think they want people knowing that?
[02:01:26.700 --> 02:01:29.061]  Hey, you're taking my rights in my town, my city?
[02:01:29.641 --> 02:01:35.743]  You're treating me like a slave, but the border's wide open and people can sneak simulated nukes in and bring them to the courthouse?
[02:01:36.323 --> 02:01:38.384]  The federal courthouse in Tucson?
[02:01:39.324 --> 02:01:40.705]  You think they want that?
[02:01:41.705 --> 02:01:43.146]  No, they do not want that.
[02:01:43.186 --> 02:01:48.828]  They want to just scare the daylights out of you and train you how to be a good little slave.
[02:01:50.828 --> 02:01:53.089]  I tell you, that is just amazing.
[02:01:53.829 --> 02:01:55.590]  So what do you think of them apples, folks?
[02:01:56.571 --> 02:02:01.293]  We'll come back and go to John and Melissa in Texas.
[02:02:01.313 --> 02:02:04.814]  We'll go to John in Tennessee and a bunch of other callers here that are holding.
[02:02:06.275 --> 02:02:07.676]  The total free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:02:07.696 --> 02:02:11.918]  And then I'll get into implanted chips to go to the hospital and everything else.
[02:02:17.443 --> 02:02:18.423]  Stay with us.
[02:02:18.523 --> 02:02:31.066]  And again, the websites are PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.net, and VirginUtah.com, JonesReport.com.
[02:02:31.106 --> 02:02:32.206]  A lot of different websites.
[02:02:32.746 --> 02:02:33.446]  So stay with us.
[02:02:33.486 --> 02:02:34.386]  We'll be back on the other side.
[02:02:45.791 --> 02:02:48.614]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[02:02:48.734 --> 02:02:49.575]  Michael Trudeau here.
[02:02:49.695 --> 02:02:52.999]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[02:02:53.199 --> 02:02:58.845]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[02:02:59.005 --> 02:03:02.008]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[02:03:02.268 --> 02:03:06.554]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[02:03:06.735 --> 02:03:08.658]  The chronic, everyday pain was miserable.
[02:03:08.778 --> 02:03:15.848]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[02:03:16.028 --> 02:03:18.492]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[02:03:18.792 --> 02:03:21.453]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice.
[02:03:21.613 --> 02:03:23.114]  Only this time, it changed my life.
[02:03:23.394 --> 02:03:25.154]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement.
[02:03:25.234 --> 02:03:27.315]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[02:03:27.515 --> 02:03:29.976]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[02:03:30.016 --> 02:03:32.717]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[02:03:32.917 --> 02:03:33.438]  Side effects?
[02:03:33.598 --> 02:03:35.878]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[02:03:36.039 --> 02:03:37.519]  Call Kliscott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[02:03:37.559 --> 02:03:37.779]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[02:03:37.859 --> 02:03:39.180]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[02:03:39.220 --> 02:03:39.820]  It worked for me.
[02:03:45.948 --> 02:03:48.829]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:03:49.190 --> 02:03:52.051]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:03:52.291 --> 02:03:58.474]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:04:49.661 --> 02:04:54.104]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:04:54.244 --> 02:04:58.608]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:04:58.648 --> 02:05:00.009]  The New World Order.
[02:05:00.749 --> 02:05:01.110]  Panama.
[02:05:01.130 --> 02:05:01.991]  You will lose your liberty.

[02:05:50.353 --> 02:05:50.993]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.674 --> 02:05:52.714]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.435 --> 02:05:54.555]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.176 --> 02:05:56.016]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.776 --> 02:05:58.697]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.717 --> 02:06:02.099]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.519 --> 02:06:06.642]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.503 --> 02:06:09.343]  All right, folks.
[02:06:09.543 --> 02:06:11.824]  We are now into hour number three.
[02:06:11.884 --> 02:06:14.766]  Eight minutes and 27 seconds into hour number three.
[02:06:17.410 --> 02:06:20.752]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls, give you a chance to respond to all this.
[02:06:21.332 --> 02:06:23.714]  Melissa in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:06:24.294 --> 02:06:25.895]  Yes, Alex, can you hear me now?
[02:06:25.995 --> 02:06:26.696]  Yes, I can.
[02:06:26.716 --> 02:06:27.116]  Oh, good.
[02:06:27.656 --> 02:06:43.566]  Listen, this morning I was flipping through the news stations here, local affiliates in Austin, and forgive me for not noticing which one it was, but they said that as soon as next week, Austin Music Network will be moving into the facilities at Northwestern Avenue.
[02:06:45.814 --> 02:06:53.456]  Yeah, and then on TV, AXS television and the board are going, no, there's no plan, we're not doing this, and in their own handouts say it.
[02:06:53.996 --> 02:07:07.200]  Yeah, and the fellow Jeff here that called in on your show the other night and tried to say it wasn't that bad and nothing's going to happen until after this season is over, etc.
[02:07:08.040 --> 02:07:09.541]  They're doing this mid-season?
[02:07:09.561 --> 02:07:10.781]  This is pretty interesting.
[02:07:11.670 --> 02:07:15.453]  Well, what it does is it takes over the channels, it regulates what you can say and do.
[02:07:15.573 --> 02:07:20.156]  Now, visualizing your mind, Melissa, were you watching cable?
[02:07:20.176 --> 02:07:21.537]  Were you watching broadcast?
[02:07:22.037 --> 02:07:27.540]  This was probably, it was either NBC morning, KXAN, I think.
[02:07:27.601 --> 02:07:40.309]  I'm not sure which pretty face was telling me the wonderful news, but it was either NBC, KXAN local news, or CBS, the Fred Cantu broadcast.
[02:07:42.063 --> 02:07:50.146]  Yeah, they're in there announcing that it's a done deal, and don't worry, we're going to control your speech, and you're going to have one channel for free speech instead of three, and then later, you've got it just right out in the open.
[02:07:51.106 --> 02:07:57.029]  Well, it's always something, and if it's not, well... Hadn't even gone to the city council yet, they're just doing it.
[02:07:57.069 --> 02:07:57.649]  Yeah.
[02:07:57.949 --> 02:07:58.669]  Just pal-mel.
[02:07:59.250 --> 02:08:01.050]  I don't know what to do to stop it.
[02:08:01.890 --> 02:08:11.034]  I mean, no matter what people do, they just keep... kind of like those army ants that you watch on the Discovery Channel, they just take over.
[02:08:12.651 --> 02:08:14.552]  Well, they've got our resources, you see.
[02:08:14.592 --> 02:08:16.153]  They own and run our lives.
[02:08:16.573 --> 02:08:22.776]  And now to really get us to be prisoners, not just slaves, they've got the threat of terrorism to hold over our heads.
[02:08:23.137 --> 02:08:24.617]  I'm not very good at lickin' boots.
[02:08:26.238 --> 02:08:27.059]  I don't know what I'll do.
[02:08:27.199 --> 02:08:29.400]  So, what exactly did they say on the newscast?
[02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:39.325]  That as soon as, as early as next week, Austin Music Network will be moving into Access Television Studios.
[02:08:41.838 --> 02:08:45.864]  And again, it has nothing to do with free speech, but they said the music, yes, we're taking over the channels.
[02:08:46.285 --> 02:08:47.667]  Don't worry, you can have music!
[02:08:48.348 --> 02:08:49.149]  Yeah, boy.
[02:08:50.270 --> 02:08:51.132]  And it's not even that good.
[02:08:51.152 --> 02:08:53.795]  Well, we had hundreds of people show up yesterday, and, uh...
[02:08:56.090 --> 02:08:56.991]  It was incredible.
[02:08:57.211 --> 02:09:08.296]  I mean, just 99% of people against it, in their face, eloquent arguments against it, and then, oh no, we're not doing anything as the printouts said they were taking over.
[02:09:08.356 --> 02:09:10.957]  I mean, it's like there is no Patriot Act 2.
[02:09:11.017 --> 02:09:12.458]  Next day there is a Patriot Act 2.
[02:09:12.498 --> 02:09:15.179]  Next day, we never said there was, and the bill's introduced.
[02:09:15.239 --> 02:09:22.923]  You know, it's just... We must be dealing with alternative universes here, because they seem to be on a different plane.
[02:09:23.403 --> 02:09:25.224]  They say one thing and do another, and we
[02:09:25.635 --> 02:09:32.276]  We try to act in an honest and fair manner, and they just break all the rules, even as far as language.
[02:09:32.657 --> 02:09:36.337]  Well, it's like, uh, there are weapons of mass destruction a hundred times.
[02:09:36.397 --> 02:09:40.678]  Then, we never said there were weapons of mass destruction, and then, oh, see, we found the weapons of mass destruction!
[02:09:40.718 --> 02:09:43.279]  I mean, it's just, it's, it's, it's cuckoo!
[02:09:44.039 --> 02:09:49.660]  But the average person is so unconscious, just kind of halfway listening, it's, okay, alright.
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:52.181]  Well, yeah, and, you know, this is
[02:09:54.066 --> 02:10:02.812]  There's a verse in the Bible that talks about those that are the wicked ones are deceived and being, or they are deceiving and being deceived.
[02:10:03.352 --> 02:10:09.896]  So they believe that what they're doing is truthful and honest as they deceive others.
[02:10:11.377 --> 02:10:12.098]  It's grotesque.
[02:10:14.419 --> 02:10:19.883]  Well, it looks like legal action is in order and I'm still researching the best avenues for that.
[02:10:21.277 --> 02:10:21.958]  Trespassing.
[02:10:21.978 --> 02:10:24.520]  That's what they're going to do down there at Access.
[02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:25.921]  They're going to trespass.
[02:10:26.162 --> 02:10:27.503]  Come in and start taking over.
[02:10:27.963 --> 02:10:28.584]  Well, that's it.
[02:10:28.864 --> 02:10:32.107]  And again, no city rule, no charter, just... No, I know.
[02:10:32.127 --> 02:10:37.352]  They were announcing they'd get up and go, well, we've made the decisions and it's happening and nothing's happened and you're going to like it.
[02:10:37.452 --> 02:10:42.497]  And they had city printouts that said, ACTV, you know, being taken over.
[02:10:43.078 --> 02:10:47.539]  And then I'd say, ACTV, and they'd go, there's no... I had a city attorney walk up and go, where is ACTV on there?
[02:10:47.559 --> 02:10:49.039]  And I said, right here at the top of the page.
[02:10:49.319 --> 02:10:49.820]  No, it's not.
[02:10:49.880 --> 02:10:50.740]  I said, it's right there.
[02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:53.360]  I mean, it was like... I mean, this is like 1984.
[02:10:53.500 --> 02:11:01.822]  It was like being in a room with O'Brien, and I'm Winston, and, you know, he's telling me, no, I'm holding up five fingers, and Winston's like, no, you're holding up two.
[02:11:02.683 --> 02:11:04.463]  And, yeah, it's just, I mean, whoa.
[02:11:05.203 --> 02:11:06.524]  Well, continue on, Alex.
[02:11:06.564 --> 02:11:09.284]  What else can we do?
[02:11:09.784 --> 02:11:12.565]  Well, they're going to have a lot of fun with us once we don't have TV to fight them.
[02:11:13.228 --> 02:11:13.709]  Well, I know.
[02:11:14.609 --> 02:11:16.131]  But I want to commend everybody that showed up.
[02:11:16.231 --> 02:11:19.814]  Oh, also, they said, come to the producer forum about this on the 12th of next month.
[02:11:20.135 --> 02:11:24.879]  Just so happens to be the same night when the city council is going to be ruling on this.
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:27.422]  Oh, come over here and talk to us.
[02:11:27.442 --> 02:11:28.022]  Ha, ha, ha.
[02:11:31.445 --> 02:11:35.245]  I mean, how dumb... and a bunch of people would be fooled by that and go to the producer meeting.
[02:11:35.646 --> 02:11:36.926]  Oh, God!
[02:11:37.026 --> 02:11:43.628]  Yeah, I mean, it's all just... Really, these are tactics you use on game, like when you're hunting them or something.
[02:11:43.768 --> 02:11:44.788]  They're like hunting us.
[02:11:44.808 --> 02:11:48.409]  They use these systems of deception and warfare on us.
[02:11:49.429 --> 02:11:51.189]  Payton switch, everything else.
[02:11:51.530 --> 02:11:55.831]  Put some feed corn down, fool them, and then sit in your front porch and shoot them.
[02:11:55.891 --> 02:11:57.251]  Yeah, that's the way to do it.
[02:11:57.868 --> 02:12:02.170]  And again, folks, she's using an analogy as if we're the deer and they're the hunters.
[02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:15.877]  But I want you to understand, this city attorney walked over while I'm sitting there, while the hearing's going on, after I'd given a speech, and says, what city document do you have saying they're taking over AXS TV?
[02:12:16.757 --> 02:12:17.837]  And I had another document in my hand.
[02:12:17.857 --> 02:12:18.918]  He goes, no, that's a press release.
[02:12:18.958 --> 02:12:19.498]  I said, no, no, no.
[02:12:19.518 --> 02:12:20.879]  This is the city of Austin.
[02:12:21.559 --> 02:12:22.260]  Here's the website.
[02:12:22.300 --> 02:12:23.060]  Here's the print-off.
[02:12:24.165 --> 02:12:26.606]  It says, you know, reorganization, takeover, see?
[02:12:26.886 --> 02:12:28.027]  ACTV, see that?
[02:12:28.047 --> 02:12:29.808]  And he said, no, I don't see it!
[02:12:29.828 --> 02:12:32.349]  And he just kept smiling like he was intimidating me.
[02:12:32.369 --> 02:12:35.171]  I just started laughing at him and shoved a camera in his face.
[02:12:35.891 --> 02:12:41.034]  And then he, uh, in like some type of weird neurotic behavior, passed gas on me and then walked off.
[02:12:41.574 --> 02:12:43.315]  He was using chemical warfare on me.
[02:12:43.815 --> 02:12:44.735]  No, I'm not kidding!
[02:12:45.596 --> 02:12:46.436]  Unbelievable!
[02:12:46.977 --> 02:12:49.458]  These people, they're not even human!
[02:12:50.198 --> 02:12:50.919]  This is gross!
[02:12:52.039 --> 02:12:53.240]  I'm sorry to have to tell that.
[02:12:54.701 --> 02:12:57.903]  But it tells people exactly what we're dealing with.
[02:12:59.064 --> 02:13:01.206]  How grotesque.
[02:13:01.866 --> 02:13:04.268]  I can't believe I just told that story I've been wanting to all day.
[02:13:04.288 --> 02:13:09.391]  I actually heard it, looked at him, he smiled, walked off, I was almost nerve gassed by it.
[02:13:10.232 --> 02:13:15.655]  Everybody was going, ohhhh.
[02:13:15.936 --> 02:13:17.457]  What has happened to this country?
[02:13:19.398 --> 02:13:20.759]  They're chemically attacking us.
[02:13:20.859 --> 02:13:23.961]  Alright, thanks Melissa, take care.
[02:13:25.130 --> 02:13:25.690]  Oh, man.
[02:13:27.851 --> 02:13:29.292]  That really happened, folks.
[02:13:31.853 --> 02:13:34.054]  That really happened to me.
[02:13:35.355 --> 02:13:38.536]  And it's just unbelievable.
[02:13:39.477 --> 02:13:40.157]  Unbelievable.
[02:13:41.778 --> 02:13:42.558]  There, I've told the story.
[02:13:42.598 --> 02:13:43.619]  It's true.
[02:13:45.479 --> 02:13:47.901]  These people are a pit of hell, folks.
[02:13:48.781 --> 02:13:52.062]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Tennessee.
[02:13:52.163 --> 02:13:52.983]  John, go ahead.
[02:13:53.638 --> 02:13:55.359]  Thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[02:13:56.659 --> 02:14:04.421]  Before I get to the point of my call, I want to say, first of all, thank you for the work that you put into your radio program and all that you do.
[02:14:06.242 --> 02:14:15.965]  I must have had a good pastor as a young child back in 1963, because I remember being taught this in church, that this was coming.
[02:14:16.065 --> 02:14:19.866]  And everything that the man said is coming true.
[02:14:21.383 --> 02:14:24.706]  The reason for my call is I was on vacation last week.
[02:14:24.766 --> 02:14:25.507]  I left the state.
[02:14:26.287 --> 02:14:37.877]  I came home, went to work today, talked to a friend, and apparently there's been a SUV exploded behind Opry Mills Mall in Nashville sometime last week.
[02:14:37.977 --> 02:14:38.858]  It was a gentleman.
[02:14:40.039 --> 02:14:42.001]  Apparently he sent his family away.
[02:14:42.021 --> 02:14:47.805]  I don't know if he was Middle Eastern descent or where he was from, but they cannot find the family.
[02:14:50.427 --> 02:14:52.548]  He didn't know what he was doing with the bomb or something.
[02:14:52.689 --> 02:14:56.071]  It was a failed attempt, but it exploded the SUV to pieces.
[02:14:56.791 --> 02:14:57.872]  I haven't heard it ever again.
[02:14:57.892 --> 02:15:00.674]  Well, see, that's the type of real terror attack you'll see.
[02:15:00.894 --> 02:15:04.536]  Uncoordinated, low-level, soft target.
[02:15:05.097 --> 02:15:05.977]  Well, I haven't heard it ever again.
[02:15:05.997 --> 02:15:09.900]  And of Norad standing down and jets T-boning buildings and...
[02:15:10.737 --> 02:15:12.598]  Public officials being warned not to fly.
[02:15:12.638 --> 02:15:20.462]  That's the government, but we are at danger of copycats hearing all this and really thinking Al Qaeda is, you know, fighting the New World Order.
[02:15:22.963 --> 02:15:23.903]  I didn't hear about that.
[02:15:23.923 --> 02:15:24.824]  Can you send me the article?
[02:15:25.384 --> 02:15:27.125]  Well, it wasn't an article.
[02:15:27.145 --> 02:15:36.969]  I guess it was on local television news, and that's why I was calling you to maybe get you to check in with the NBC affiliate or the Nashville newspaper or something.
[02:15:36.989 --> 02:15:38.270]  I haven't heard anything about it.
[02:15:38.894 --> 02:15:40.674]  Either locally or nationally.
[02:15:40.934 --> 02:15:42.995]  And granted, the convention is going on this week.
[02:15:43.055 --> 02:15:45.855]  Everyone's eyes and ears are on that joke.
[02:15:46.856 --> 02:15:49.336]  But it's being kept quiet here in Nashville.
[02:15:49.516 --> 02:15:54.637]  Well, we had the cop reportedly planting a pipe bomb in New York last week, so who knows what's going on.
[02:15:55.837 --> 02:15:56.298]  Well, all right.
[02:15:56.338 --> 02:15:57.998]  Again, one more thing.
[02:15:58.038 --> 02:16:08.220]  You know, the previous caller, Melissa, I guess, was saying that she was drawing some biblical parallels and whatnot to this.
[02:16:10.025 --> 02:16:21.854]  For us to be thinking in a conspiratorial fashion or believe that there's evil in this country or shadow government or the Illuminati or globalism, we are looked at as being kooks.
[02:16:22.855 --> 02:16:33.043]  And what I would like to tell people is that another passage in the Bible says that spiritual things, and this is spiritual, are foolishness to those that aren't spiritually minded.
[02:16:33.163 --> 02:16:38.267]  And you're not going to be able to be spiritually minded without the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[02:16:38.916 --> 02:16:40.257]  You can't have that without Christ.
[02:16:40.477 --> 02:16:41.778]  This is all interesting.
[02:16:42.479 --> 02:16:44.480]  It's all exciting times that we're living in.
[02:16:44.841 --> 02:16:46.402]  I'm not saying force to give up.
[02:16:47.143 --> 02:16:57.831]  But I would say to anyone that's listening that isn't sure of what would happen if they're in the middle of this time that's coming, be ready to look to get sure.
[02:16:58.352 --> 02:16:59.873]  Alright, thank you for your call, my friend.
[02:16:59.913 --> 02:17:00.493]  I agree with you.
[02:17:00.513 --> 02:17:07.519]  Listen, the world is nothing but a history of abuse and enslavement.
[02:17:08.186 --> 02:17:12.751]  And then you've got these people that are in total denial going, he says government might need to be watched.
[02:17:13.111 --> 02:17:14.112]  Man, he's a nut!
[02:17:14.893 --> 02:17:16.615]  That's what all the founding fathers said.
[02:17:16.755 --> 02:17:19.498]  So, you know, you see people look at you like you're a nut.
[02:17:19.658 --> 02:17:20.359]  I don't run into that.
[02:17:20.419 --> 02:17:21.660]  I just run into people waking up.
[02:17:21.740 --> 02:17:23.342]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:17:23.362 --> 02:17:27.587]  It depends on what part of the country you're in and, you know, what your charisma is and, you know, what you're up to.
[02:17:29.813 --> 02:17:31.495]  I don't know, but this is interesting news.
[02:17:31.515 --> 02:17:32.596]  I actually know Melissa.
[02:17:32.616 --> 02:17:33.697]  She's a good source of news.
[02:17:33.858 --> 02:17:35.159]  She says this was on local TV.
[02:17:35.199 --> 02:17:35.660]  I believe it.
[02:17:36.100 --> 02:17:39.043]  They were talking like it was going to happen next week, and then would say, we're not doing anything!
[02:17:39.083 --> 02:17:39.904]  Shut up, you're a liar!
[02:17:42.367 --> 02:17:45.010]  And then, uh, attack with chemical weapons is what they would do, yes.
[02:17:46.500 --> 02:17:47.500]  It's finally here!
[02:17:47.640 --> 02:17:48.621]  Spring has arrived!
[02:17:48.801 --> 02:17:51.781]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:17:52.001 --> 02:17:55.422]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:17:55.442 --> 02:18:03.804]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[02:18:04.084 --> 02:18:07.805]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.

[02:18:45.879 --> 02:18:49.341]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:18:49.621 --> 02:18:53.122]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:18:53.202 --> 02:18:57.144]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:18:57.384 --> 02:19:03.527]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:19:03.947 --> 02:19:11.851]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:19:12.251 --> 02:19:17.615]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:19:17.775 --> 02:19:21.537]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:19:21.897 --> 02:19:23.779]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclaimable.
[02:19:23.819 --> 02:19:26.000]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:31.163]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[02:19:31.203 --> 02:19:36.767]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:19:44.632 --> 02:19:45.052]  Gold.
[02:19:45.413 --> 02:19:46.673]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:19:46.934 --> 02:19:48.555]  From the Romans through the Renaissance.
[02:19:48.815 --> 02:19:50.856]  From the Industrial Age to the Space Age.
[02:19:51.156 --> 02:19:53.038]  Gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:19:53.218 --> 02:19:57.040]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:19:57.400 --> 02:19:59.302]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:19:59.342 --> 02:20:01.623]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:20:01.783 --> 02:20:08.848]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[02:20:08.868 --> 02:20:09.528]  We're good to go.
[02:20:23.899 --> 02:20:24.039]  Call 800-686-2237
[02:20:44.899 --> 02:20:48.640]  In today's world of discord and disappointment, one thing's for sure.
[02:20:48.900 --> 02:20:53.682]  Car cover owners are so satisfied, they buy their car covers all over again.
[02:20:53.702 --> 02:20:55.462]  Think car covers are a hassle?
[02:20:55.742 --> 02:20:55.942]  No.
[02:20:56.282 --> 02:21:00.043]  Research shows owners find covers easy to put on and take off.
[02:21:00.443 --> 02:21:01.784]  Are all covers the same?
[02:21:02.044 --> 02:21:02.284]  No.
[02:21:02.564 --> 02:21:06.165]  The standard in car cover fabric is Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[02:21:06.625 --> 02:21:08.746]  Don't let sun and dust damage your car.
[02:21:09.046 --> 02:21:11.547]  Kimberly Clark's Block-It Fabrics got you covered.
[02:21:11.828 --> 02:21:13.648]  That's Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[02:21:13.749 --> 02:21:15.790]  Cool weather brings cool cars.
[02:21:16.230 --> 02:21:17.130]  I don't think so.
[02:21:17.450 --> 02:21:21.092]  A cooling system can run too hot or too cold if not prepared for winter.
[02:21:21.452 --> 02:21:22.473]  Here's your to-do.
[02:21:22.693 --> 02:21:25.474]  Ask your local shop to perform the BG Coolant Flush.
[02:21:25.674 --> 02:21:31.317]  A simple test strip tells if your coolant's protecting the engine from temperature extremes or breaking down and corroding.
[02:21:31.677 --> 02:21:35.739]  The BG Chemistry cleans the system, then adds new coolant with conditioner.
[02:21:36.039 --> 02:21:40.863]  Ask your shop for a BG Coolant Flush or go to bgfindtheshop.com.
[02:21:41.123 --> 02:21:43.164]  That's bgfindtheshop.com.
[02:21:50.169 --> 02:21:52.191]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:21:52.231 --> 02:21:52.991]  until 2 p.m.
[02:21:53.051 --> 02:21:54.312]  and then back from 9 to midnight.
[02:21:54.332 --> 02:21:55.153]  We're here, folks.
[02:21:55.813 --> 02:21:57.174]  Old-time Central Standard.
[02:21:58.395 --> 02:22:05.540]  I'm going to cover some news now, then we'll come back and go to George and Linda and David and William and Randy and everybody else that is patiently holding.
[02:22:07.429 --> 02:22:08.950]  This is out of CNET News.
[02:22:09.170 --> 02:22:12.212]  Under the skin, ID chips moved toward U.S.
[02:22:12.353 --> 02:22:12.973]  hospitals.
[02:22:13.653 --> 02:22:15.815]  Remember, the Mexican government was getting them two weeks ago.
[02:22:16.375 --> 02:22:27.583]  Verichip, the company that makes the radio frequency identification RFID tags for humans, has moved one step closer to getting its technology into hospitals.
[02:22:27.643 --> 02:22:34.188]  The Federal Drug Administration issued a ruling Tuesday that essentially begins a final review process
[02:22:35.146 --> 02:22:45.511]  That will determine whether hospitals can use RFID systems from the Palm Beach, Florida-based company to identify patients and or permit relevant hospital staff to access medical records.
[02:22:45.551 --> 02:22:45.771]  See?
[02:22:46.151 --> 02:22:47.952]  You gotta have a chip to use the computers.
[02:22:47.992 --> 02:22:48.973]  That's just like in Mexico.
[02:22:48.993 --> 02:22:51.354]  They're gonna make cops have it to use a gun.
[02:22:51.894 --> 02:22:53.815]  And then we gotta... Folks, I'm not kidding, okay?
[02:22:53.855 --> 02:22:55.356]  I've had the people from the company on.
[02:22:55.956 --> 02:23:01.239]  Said Angela Fulcher, Vice President of Marketing, a Ford Demon chip.
[02:23:01.279 --> 02:23:01.999]  I mean, Vera chip.
[02:23:03.556 --> 02:23:09.522]  And it says the Verichip sells 11mm RFID tags that get implanted in the fatty tissue below the right tricep.
[02:23:11.083 --> 02:23:16.928]  When near one of Verichip's scanners, the chip wakes up and radios an ID number to the scanner.
[02:23:17.689 --> 02:23:21.973]  If the number matches an ID number in database, a person with a chip is under.
[02:23:22.934 --> 02:23:27.698]  His skin can enter a secure room or complete a financial transaction.
[02:23:28.687 --> 02:23:32.628]  It is used instead of other biometric applications such as fingerprints, vultures said.
[02:23:32.648 --> 02:23:34.349]  Yeah, there's no reason to have the chip, folks.
[02:23:35.009 --> 02:23:38.490]  The approval process does not center on health risks or implications.
[02:23:38.790 --> 02:23:45.732]  Vultures said Verichip can already sell implantable RFID chips in the United States for standard security applications and the financial market.
[02:23:46.852 --> 02:23:47.032]  Oh!
[02:23:47.532 --> 02:23:50.633]  The company's basic technology has also been used in animals for years.
[02:23:53.022 --> 02:23:54.023]  Oh my gosh!
[02:23:54.183 --> 02:23:56.084]  So I hope you enjoy that, folks.
[02:23:56.305 --> 02:23:57.165]  Oh, you can work here.
[02:23:57.205 --> 02:23:59.587]  Just a quick little procedure and get your chip.
[02:24:01.068 --> 02:24:14.898]  Another article here out of the register about how the Jacobi Medical Center in New York is tagging patients with RFID chips in a pilot project run with Siemens Business Services, a German company.
[02:24:14.938 --> 02:24:19.521]  The chips are incorporated into the wristbands issued when a patient is admitted.
[02:24:19.641 --> 02:24:22.323]  And it goes on and on, conditioning you there.
[02:24:23.365 --> 02:24:28.329]  Fighter pilots could command drone swarms, this out of a new scientist.
[02:24:29.530 --> 02:24:35.834]  Jet fighter pilots could command a whole swarm of planes from the air using systems developed by a British aerospace company.
[02:24:36.275 --> 02:24:48.444]  Formerly, UK Government's District Defense Evaluation and Research Agency has developed technology that would allow a pilot to control a fighter aircraft during a mission without needing to constantly keep a check on them.
[02:24:49.364 --> 02:24:58.313]  So far, the system has been demonstrated as part of a new simulator developed by Quint IQ, modeled on the Eurofighter.
[02:24:59.394 --> 02:25:06.961]  The system allows a pilot to program a group of up to five unmanned planes to perform a simple task like searching an area for enemy vehicles.
[02:25:07.101 --> 02:25:11.145]  The unmanned aerial vehicles, under the pilot's control, use software agents
[02:25:11.798 --> 02:25:20.361]  To carry out their mission, these agents are given a goal to find enemy targets, for example, and can independently deal with the various variables involved.
[02:25:21.741 --> 02:25:25.943]  They say within 2010, most of the fighter aircraft will be drones alone.
[02:25:27.083 --> 02:25:31.444]  It'll get worse and worse, and then a few globalists can control these robotic armies.
[02:25:31.624 --> 02:25:33.845]  And no, we're not talking about iRobot folks.
[02:25:34.785 --> 02:25:38.527]  They can fly them into buildings with just a few people controlling it, and then say it was terrorists.
[02:25:38.547 --> 02:25:39.527]  They can do whatever they want.
[02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:41.501]  Stealthy bombers.
[02:25:41.721 --> 02:25:54.352]  The UAVs have to be intelligent enough to do the right things without having to refer to a human operator, says John Platt, Technical Manager for Air Vehicles at Quint IQ.
[02:25:54.572 --> 02:26:04.420]  In case of a search and destroy mission, the unmanned aerial vehicle would locate a potential target and send a message, imitative, back to the pilot, who could give the command to attack it or continue to search.
[02:26:04.961 --> 02:26:08.884]  But a pilot could also override the UAV's behavior
[02:26:09.742 --> 02:26:13.783]  Autonomous behavior and even control individual planes by hand if necessary.
[02:26:14.743 --> 02:26:21.985]  If the link between the UAVs and the fighters should fail, they must also be able to continue their mission independently or return to base.
[02:26:23.046 --> 02:26:25.626]  But they can't fly jetliners and the planes by remote control.
[02:26:26.386 --> 02:26:32.308]  From micro spies to stealthy bombers, UAVs are making the vision of unmanned
[02:26:33.001 --> 02:26:41.264]  Aircraft Reality, says Peter Brickett, Managing Director of the spin-off company that developed the simulator called QSim.
[02:26:43.045 --> 02:26:55.209]  And it says it brings to the future the life of combat environment where a fast jet is controlling a whole package of UAVs, thereby delivering greater firepower and reconnaissance ability.
[02:26:56.749 --> 02:27:01.171]  And that's the future, folks, and they say they're going to have these watching us in our cities.
[02:27:02.133 --> 02:27:10.856]  We'll come back, take some of your calls, and then get into... Terry Film Director, the bullets in the water were not from an actual event, it's staged.
[02:27:11.777 --> 02:27:12.537]  Of course it is.
[02:27:13.077 --> 02:27:16.138]  Bush using drugs to control depression, erratic behavior.
[02:27:16.878 --> 02:27:20.960]  Oil prices surge, a 21 year record, as fears grow.
[02:27:22.040 --> 02:27:24.881]  It's all coming up, but your calls first when we get back.
[02:27:25.742 --> 02:27:26.802]  So stay with us!
[02:27:27.924 --> 02:27:33.934]  PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com are the websites.
[02:27:36.237 --> 02:27:37.159]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.639 --> 02:27:39.242]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.163 --> 02:27:42.848]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.093 --> 02:27:49.674]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[02:27:49.734 --> 02:27:51.335]  I've tried many, many products.
[02:27:51.495 --> 02:27:53.796]  I have never experienced anything like Collagenate.
[02:27:54.236 --> 02:27:58.098]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than eight weeks.
[02:27:58.498 --> 02:27:59.198]  It truly works.
[02:27:59.591 --> 02:28:00.791]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[02:28:01.151 --> 02:28:07.092]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:28:07.192 --> 02:28:13.313]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[02:28:13.674 --> 02:28:17.674]  Our listeners keep telling us Vim and Vigor's Collagenate really does work.
[02:28:18.094 --> 02:28:19.095]  It's healthy for you too.
[02:28:19.495 --> 02:28:26.976]  In addition to helping you lose weight, Collagenate is also designed to improve strength and health of muscles, joints, skin, hair and nails.
[02:28:27.396 --> 02:28:29.617]  So take Collagenate and rejuvenate.
[02:28:29.677 --> 02:28:30.758]  Call Vim and Vigor today.
[02:28:30.778 --> 02:28:31.038]  1-800-622-FIN.
[02:28:31.098 --> 02:28:31.298]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[02:28:31.438 --> 02:28:33.800]  And listen, get $25 off a 3-month supply of Collagenate.
[02:28:33.820 --> 02:28:34.260]  So call now.
[02:28:34.280 --> 02:28:34.440]  1-800-622-FIN.
[02:28:34.520 --> 02:28:34.720]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[02:28:46.107 --> 02:28:49.130]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:28:49.430 --> 02:28:54.374]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:54.634 --> 02:28:58.977]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:28:59.278 --> 02:29:08.185]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:29:08.405 --> 02:29:12.028]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:29:12.308 --> 02:29:17.335]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:29:17.635 --> 02:29:24.383]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:29:24.864 --> 02:29:25.385]  What about you?
[02:29:26.141 --> 02:29:31.044]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35.

[02:29:32.725 --> 02:29:34.606]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[02:29:46.047 --> 02:29:49.311]  Ever walk into someone's house and you can tell instantly they own pets?
[02:29:49.651 --> 02:29:54.316]  They've made the mistake of using a pet odor and stain product that only covers the problem temporarily.
[02:29:54.516 --> 02:29:56.038]  We don't have that problem in our home.
[02:29:56.238 --> 02:29:58.640]  We've discovered it's just better to use PAWS.
[02:29:58.881 --> 02:30:05.608]  Pet Accident Wash-Up Solution, or PAWS, is the quickest and safest pet stain and odor eliminator known to men, or man's best friend.
[02:30:05.888 --> 02:30:09.110]  Paws are safe on any material, even directly on your pet's bedding.
[02:30:09.370 --> 02:30:11.771]  Paws will work on the toughest stains and odors in your home.

[02:30:14.993 --> 02:30:17.194]  Proving again, it's just better to use paws.
[02:30:17.554 --> 02:30:20.796]  It's only a matter of time until Fido, or Fluffy, has an accident.
[02:30:21.076 --> 02:30:22.277]  Be prepared with PAWS.
[02:30:22.557 --> 02:30:26.559]  Use PAWS anywhere stains and odors are a problem, like the laundry or the bathroom.
[02:30:26.779 --> 02:30:30.280]  Try PAWS once and you'll quickly discover it's just better to use PAWS.
[02:30:30.520 --> 02:30:35.303]  Call 1-877-289-PAWS or visit GetPAWS.com.
[02:30:35.503 --> 02:30:39.444]  That's www.getpaws.com.
[02:30:39.624 --> 02:30:42.346]  PAWS comes with a 110% money back guarantee.
[02:30:42.646 --> 02:30:44.387]  Use nothing to lose but stains and odors!
[02:30:50.865 --> 02:30:52.766]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:53.247 --> 02:30:56.089]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:30:59.091 --> 02:31:04.134]  Alright folks, we've got about, what, 26 and a half minutes left and a lot of key info to cover.
[02:31:04.795 --> 02:31:08.717]  We're about to go to your calls, but first, Demi Morrow comes up a few times a week with us.
[02:31:09.358 --> 02:31:10.839]  New Millennium Concepts.
[02:31:12.380 --> 02:31:15.982]  They can try to control our lives and try to put poison in our food and our water.
[02:31:16.022 --> 02:31:18.244]  They can try to dumb us down and force vaccines on us.
[02:31:19.013 --> 02:31:24.518]  The least we can do is put shower filters on our water so we don't absorb it to the skin and breathe it.
[02:31:25.559 --> 02:31:36.408]  The least we can do is filter and purify our water with real proven systems, not the questionable, and that's putting it lightly, bottled water or the admittedly toxic tap water.
[02:31:37.649 --> 02:31:40.291]  And it is now time to stop procrastinating.
[02:31:40.331 --> 02:31:41.472]  These are made in America.
[02:31:42.188 --> 02:31:46.210]  They support the broadcast, and it's the best units I know of out there, folks.
[02:31:46.750 --> 02:31:47.991]  Debbie, good to have you on with us.
[02:31:48.211 --> 02:31:48.971]  Hi there, Alex.
[02:31:49.052 --> 02:31:50.112]  Thanks for having me.
[02:31:50.152 --> 02:31:51.413]  It's always a pleasure.
[02:31:51.493 --> 02:31:53.414]  It's always good to have you up with us.
[02:31:53.474 --> 02:31:54.894]  Thanks, I appreciate it.
[02:31:55.435 --> 02:31:59.497]  So, boy, that was an interesting segment that you were just going over.
[02:31:59.517 --> 02:32:01.818]  It was very good.
[02:32:01.838 --> 02:32:04.159]  Oh, all the high-tech stuff.
[02:32:04.259 --> 02:32:05.900]  Yeah, it was really interesting.
[02:32:05.920 --> 02:32:07.601]  I was enjoying listening to you.
[02:32:08.129 --> 02:32:25.142]  You know, we're really coming towards the end of the month here, a couple more days, and we'd really like to get those sales in for you so we can continue, as we always do, helping all of your listeners have good health through keeping poisons out of their system.
[02:32:25.262 --> 02:32:35.950]  So, I just wanted to do a little reminder that we're having an end-of-the-month sale where we're discounting the KDHR filters all the way down to $27 apiece with an order
[02:32:38.126 --> 02:32:43.347]  of either a Berkey light with or without lights and you still get the other free gifts with it.
[02:32:44.407 --> 02:32:45.728]  That's a really good opportunity.
[02:32:45.748 --> 02:32:56.250]  And the other free gifts are a video produced by a former federal government specialist on chemical, biological, radiological, how to truly make your house safe without the duct tape.
[02:32:57.171 --> 02:33:03.852]  You also have the video Prudent Places, 500 color maps, maps of rainfall, populations, safe places to be.
[02:33:04.872 --> 02:33:05.693]  When you get the $1.99 special
[02:33:08.596 --> 02:33:14.020]  The Berkey Light without the lighting system, why it's called the Berkey Light, it's a great purification system.
[02:33:14.060 --> 02:33:19.444]  You get one of the free gifts and you can get half price on one of the KDF shower filters if you want to also get that.
[02:33:19.864 --> 02:33:30.792]  For $259 you get it with the LED light array in the base with a rechargeable system that burns for 14 years continuously with these LEDs.
[02:33:31.639 --> 02:33:33.621]  Uh, that just got a bunch of different systems.
[02:33:33.721 --> 02:33:37.043]  Give Debbie a call right now, folks, at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:33:37.063 --> 02:33:40.606]  There's a lot of gimmicks, a lot of magic, you know, Heal You stuff out there.
[02:33:45.549 --> 02:33:48.912]  Folks, this is simply put, the real deal.
[02:33:49.292 --> 02:33:53.496]  This is just a high quality, made in America, water purification system.
[02:33:53.816 --> 02:33:58.981]  You try to buy the same thing at a camping supply store, it's usually $300, $400.
[02:33:59.481 --> 02:34:00.742]  Very easy to put together.
[02:34:00.843 --> 02:34:03.665]  Gravity fed filtration system.
[02:34:04.286 --> 02:34:05.987]  Give Debbie a call, 1-888-803-4438.
[02:34:06.047 --> 02:34:06.788]  Debbie?
[02:34:06.808 --> 02:34:08.109]  Well, thank you.
[02:34:13.092 --> 02:34:16.536]  Leave your name and number if you get my machine and I will get back with you.
[02:34:16.556 --> 02:34:19.159]  And it's always a pleasure, Alex.
[02:34:20.040 --> 02:34:21.582]  Well Debbie, it's always good to have you on.
[02:34:21.662 --> 02:34:24.546]  Also, you still have the sports bottle special.
[02:34:24.566 --> 02:34:28.070]  Now this isn't a purifier, it's a filter.
[02:34:28.952 --> 02:34:32.815]  And it makes pond water, lake water, tap water, whatever safe.
[02:34:32.835 --> 02:34:33.636]  640 refills.
[02:34:34.476 --> 02:34:39.860]  You'll make your money back in two weeks from not buying a bottle of water at $1.60 a bottle.
[02:34:40.781 --> 02:34:45.404]  It's guaranteed to be a lot cleaner than the bottle of water you're drinking that's just filtered tap water.
[02:34:45.865 --> 02:34:47.186]  This is a great system.
[02:34:47.246 --> 02:34:48.887]  Makes pond water, lake water safe.
[02:34:49.247 --> 02:34:50.588]  Cleans up your tap water.
[02:34:51.329 --> 02:34:53.671]  This is a great system to have when you're out and about.
[02:34:54.051 --> 02:34:55.392]  What are the specials on that, Debbie?
[02:34:55.852 --> 02:35:19.450]  We have the generic labeled ones which are exactly the same as the Berkey Sport labeled ones but we have an opportunity to get them at a lower price so we're able to pass that on to your listeners so they get 5 Berkey Sport bottles for $99 or they can get 12 Berkey Sport bottles for $199 and I have to tell you I take mine everywhere.
[02:35:19.470 --> 02:35:22.553]  You know we're such a busy nation
[02:35:23.570 --> 02:35:25.031]  On the go, all the time.
[02:35:25.051 --> 02:35:40.959]  It's so handy to have a Berkey Sport bottle to be able to take that water from, you know, if you stop in a restaurant to get something to eat or whatever the case may be, you just pour the water in, squeeze it out into a cup, and you've got filtered water.
[02:35:41.919 --> 02:35:42.880]  They go up to 640 refills.
[02:35:42.900 --> 02:35:43.960]  Absolutely.
[02:35:45.101 --> 02:35:46.281]  And they're fantastic.
[02:35:46.802 --> 02:35:49.063]  It's, it's, I mean, I've got a bunch of myself.
[02:35:49.955 --> 02:35:59.624]  And you try to buy these at a store, they're $30, $40, and the elements and the ones I see at the store are about half as heavy as the element that's in your filter.
[02:35:59.684 --> 02:36:06.190]  And again, you get this price just because it doesn't say New Millennium on it or Big Berkey on it, you end up getting the exact same filter.
[02:36:06.670 --> 02:36:07.511]  So again, folks,
[02:36:08.248 --> 02:36:08.668]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:36:08.708 --> 02:36:09.349]  Y'all have a nice day.
[02:36:09.389 --> 02:36:10.290]  You have a good weekend.
[02:36:26.161 --> 02:36:28.982]  I know it's Thursday, but I won't be talking to you until next week.
[02:36:29.802 --> 02:36:40.026]  Also, you can go to Berkeywater.com and link through and just put in the comment section that it's an Alex Jones special and what free gift you want, or do that at Infowars.com.
[02:36:41.047 --> 02:36:43.047]  Let's go back to the calls quickly, get to everybody.
[02:36:44.148 --> 02:36:45.728]  Oh boy, who's up next here, Stephanie?
[02:36:45.768 --> 02:36:46.409]  I get confused.
[02:36:47.589 --> 02:36:48.509]  George in Texas.
[02:36:48.549 --> 02:36:49.110]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:36:49.170 --> 02:36:49.770]  Thanks for holding.
[02:36:50.810 --> 02:36:51.230]  Hello, Alex.
[02:36:51.250 --> 02:36:51.811]  Can you hear me?
[02:36:52.031 --> 02:36:52.451]  Yes, sir.
[02:36:53.286 --> 02:36:55.748]  Uh, this is George and Burnett, not George and Austin.
[02:36:56.048 --> 02:36:56.729]  Sorry about that.
[02:36:56.749 --> 02:36:58.650]  Okay, sir, go ahead.
[02:36:59.350 --> 02:37:07.916]  I was calling to let you know I've been listening for a long time and I think the most important radio interview you just had was with Glenn Spencer.
[02:37:09.037 --> 02:37:20.685]  The fact that somebody could bring a big suitcase into this country unopposed with the words nuclear weapon or nuclear device written all over it
[02:37:22.091 --> 02:37:26.452]  And they brought it into the country, and they can deliver it anywhere in this country.
[02:37:27.713 --> 02:37:32.614]  And our politicians are doing absolutely nothing to protect us.
[02:37:33.275 --> 02:37:36.876]  Well, because they know if there's a real terror attack, it's going to be the globalists doing it.
[02:37:36.896 --> 02:37:43.178]  I mean, you may have a few spotty attacks by Muslim copycats, but the real attacks are globalist-controlled.
[02:37:43.758 --> 02:37:46.879]  And all this security has nothing to do with terrorists.
[02:37:46.919 --> 02:37:49.880]  It's about letting us know that the government is our owner.
[02:37:51.021 --> 02:38:00.864]  Well, in any event, Michael Badnerik, the Libertarian candidate for President, is holding his birthday party in Austin on Sunday.
[02:38:00.924 --> 02:38:03.944]  I don't know if you got a press release on that or not.
[02:38:03.964 --> 02:38:06.125]  I had heard about this momentous event.
[02:38:06.805 --> 02:38:18.008]  Well, I was wondering if Glenn Spencer plans on overnighting a video copy of what he's got to you, is it possible for you to attend that
[02:38:18.772 --> 02:38:25.258]  The birthday party and maybe we can convince Fadenerick to change his position on this open border.
[02:38:26.600 --> 02:38:32.305]  He's the only guy, the only third party guy going to be on the ballot in Texas in November.
[02:38:32.345 --> 02:38:38.031]  I'd like to vote for the Constitution Party candidate, but I can't because he's not going to be on the ballot.
[02:38:39.288 --> 02:38:42.690]  We're down to the last wire here pretty soon, Alex.
[02:38:42.970 --> 02:38:47.033]  Yeah, well, again, I told you the presidents have already been chosen.
[02:38:47.053 --> 02:38:48.413]  It's a puppet situation.
[02:38:48.774 --> 02:38:51.035]  The power is at the county, state, and city level.
[02:38:51.475 --> 02:38:52.716]  That's where we can affect change.
[02:38:52.756 --> 02:38:55.657]  They divert us with everything being on who's going to be president.
[02:38:55.698 --> 02:38:56.238]  Thanks for the call.
[02:38:56.980 --> 02:39:05.146]  Meanwhile, we have thousands and thousands and thousands of municipalities and districts and all these places we could take control and block the globalists.
[02:39:05.206 --> 02:39:05.947]  But we don't do that!
[02:39:06.447 --> 02:39:08.249]  We obsess on who the chief is going to be.
[02:39:08.289 --> 02:39:10.170]  All this... And I'm not bashing you, sir.
[02:39:10.210 --> 02:39:16.995]  I mean, I think the presidency is important, but it's just... Bad Narek doesn't have a snowball chance in hell, even if he got 100% of the votes.
[02:39:17.616 --> 02:39:18.837]  It's a staged event, folks.
[02:39:19.137 --> 02:39:23.020]  But I think it's good that he's out there to get the word out and have alternative ideas and views.
[02:39:23.961 --> 02:39:25.562]  Let's go ahead and talk to Linda.
[02:39:26.523 --> 02:39:27.904]  Uh, Linda, where are you calling us from?
[02:39:28.164 --> 02:39:28.564]  Uh, Gary?
[02:39:28.885 --> 02:39:29.305]  Welcome!
[02:39:30.185 --> 02:39:30.606]  Uh, hello.
[02:39:31.366 --> 02:39:36.389]  Uh, is, is, um, Glenn Spencer a part of Ranch Rescue?
[02:39:36.789 --> 02:39:37.010]  No.
[02:39:38.190 --> 02:39:40.011]  Is Ranch Rescue still in business?
[02:39:40.892 --> 02:39:41.292]  Uh, yeah.
[02:39:41.592 --> 02:39:43.073]  I haven't talked to him in a few months, but yeah.
[02:39:43.694 --> 02:39:46.815]  Well, I'd like to ask about the guy that they were trying to help.
[02:39:47.616 --> 02:39:53.780]  Down there on the border of Arizona, right next door to the new Arizona Border Patrol Complex.
[02:39:54.880 --> 02:39:55.601]  He had a ranch.
[02:39:56.438 --> 02:39:59.219]  Yes, we've had him on.
[02:39:59.759 --> 02:40:02.120]  I know you have and I can't remember his name.
[02:40:02.681 --> 02:40:06.742]  But is he still in jail or is he back protecting his place?
[02:40:07.382 --> 02:40:08.803]  I haven't looked at that in a while.
[02:40:09.263 --> 02:40:10.924]  I'm having a weird moment too.
[02:40:10.984 --> 02:40:11.924]  I can't remember his name.
[02:40:13.345 --> 02:40:22.148]  And they had really come at him with Humvees and Mexican Federales and threatened his life.
[02:40:22.588 --> 02:40:23.969]  And that's where I threatened him.
[02:40:24.628 --> 02:40:26.248]  And I thought maybe he was still in jail.
[02:40:26.388 --> 02:40:28.649]  That's right, all one big happy family.
[02:40:28.889 --> 02:40:30.029]  Last time we had him on he wasn't.
[02:40:31.070 --> 02:40:32.050]  I know, I know.
[02:40:32.070 --> 02:40:34.091]  And I'm asking about him.
[02:40:34.191 --> 02:40:36.171]  I think that we should keep him in our thoughts.
[02:40:36.271 --> 02:40:37.431]  No, I think we should too, yeah.
[02:40:38.632 --> 02:40:53.716]  And, uh, anyway, I am just a Midwesterner who is totally against this open border to let the enemies of this country in and to shut down free speech.
[02:40:56.078 --> 02:41:04.400]  Well, it's all about getting a giant mass in here that will pull the lever for gun control and get in there and vote for, you know, all this police state, and it's amazing.
[02:41:04.440 --> 02:41:05.080]  Thanks for the call.
[02:41:05.440 --> 02:41:05.900]  Okay.
[02:41:06.160 --> 02:41:07.101]  Good to hear from you.
[02:41:07.161 --> 02:41:08.101]  David in Illinois.
[02:41:08.141 --> 02:41:08.881]  David, go ahead.
[02:41:08.921 --> 02:41:09.501]  Thanks for holding.
[02:41:12.142 --> 02:41:13.182]  Hey, Alex.
[02:41:13.222 --> 02:41:13.522]  Yes, sir.
[02:41:14.483 --> 02:41:24.425]  Yeah, it was just like you were talking before about the technology and the DARPA working with the project transformation so they can, you know, turn the military into their new Praetorian Guard.
[02:41:25.287 --> 02:41:29.610]  But, um, I kind of got riled up, you know, when the socialist guy came in.
[02:41:31.051 --> 02:41:46.721]  Because the way I see it, you know, we never really got out of feudalism, and in America we basically have some sort of neo-corporate feudalism, and, you know, saying, well, I don't want that kind of feudalism, I want socialistic, you know, state corporate feudalism.
[02:41:47.001 --> 02:41:54.926]  That, to me, is just like... Well, no, that's what these bleeding-heart socialists never get, is that any command-and-control system brings you tyranny.
[02:41:55.652 --> 02:42:00.231]  Yeah, and the social system that, you know, that they espouse were...
[02:42:01.491 --> 02:42:05.834]  If the state's going to run the corporate level, it's just a fast-track to tyranny.
[02:42:05.874 --> 02:42:07.234]  Well, we already have that.
[02:42:07.815 --> 02:42:10.896]  We have the corporations that run the government, and the government that runs the corporations.
[02:42:10.936 --> 02:42:12.777]  This symbiotic relationship.
[02:42:13.017 --> 02:42:15.859]  The only way to cut that off is to shrink the size of government.
[02:42:16.179 --> 02:42:18.260]  Then the corporations won't have the big mechanisms.
[02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:21.902]  We don't have communism or fascism or Easter Bunnyism.
[02:42:22.862 --> 02:42:30.386]  What we have is organized crime working through any command and control system they can to centralize power and control.
[02:42:31.454 --> 02:42:32.134]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:42:32.194 --> 02:42:47.298]  And they're basically, you know, with the transformation project they got running, you know, they basically say, you know, we're trying to reinvent the military and make it a new revolutionary thing, which, you know, basically, if you make something new, you have to tear down the old.
[02:42:47.838 --> 02:42:58.821]  And what I see from that Iraq thing, you know, that they're just trying to destroy the first part of the Second Amendment, the well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of the free state.
[02:42:59.884 --> 02:43:09.970]  They're blaming it all on the reserves, which isn't so much even our militias.
[02:43:10.031 --> 02:43:12.192]  We really don't have militias anymore.
[02:43:12.212 --> 02:43:13.833]  We've been taught that's bad.
[02:43:13.853 --> 02:43:17.195]  I hear you.
[02:43:17.795 --> 02:43:19.056]  I appreciate the call.
[02:43:19.477 --> 02:43:22.178]  Let's talk to William in Oregon.
[02:43:22.218 --> 02:43:22.939]  William, go ahead.
[02:43:26.471 --> 02:43:28.051]  Hello, William!
[02:43:28.611 --> 02:43:29.972]  You're on the air.
[02:43:31.432 --> 02:43:32.052]  He's gone.
[02:43:32.312 --> 02:43:33.712]  Next up, Jeff in Texas.
[02:43:33.792 --> 02:43:34.573]  Jeff, go ahead.
[02:43:34.973 --> 02:43:35.733]  Hi, Alex.
[02:43:35.813 --> 02:43:38.953]  First of all, I wanted to say how much I appreciate everything that you're doing.
[02:43:39.333 --> 02:43:40.334]  Well, I appreciate you guys.
[02:43:40.354 --> 02:43:40.774]  Go ahead.
[02:43:41.294 --> 02:43:47.735]  I'm a combat veteran from the First Gulf War, and I was given a bad conduct discharge when I told them I was sick and they wouldn't do anything about it.
[02:43:47.755 --> 02:43:52.416]  I was given an experimental anti-sarin gas pill, among other inoculations.
[02:43:53.343 --> 02:43:57.964]  I'm doing a lot better now, but really what I'm calling for is I would really like to help you.
[02:43:57.984 --> 02:43:59.265]  I would like to do some work with you.
[02:44:00.085 --> 02:44:01.185]  Can I volunteer some time?
[02:44:01.445 --> 02:44:08.167]  Is there anyone I can talk to about maybe doing some research for you or just generally helping out?
[02:44:08.207 --> 02:44:12.169]  Because I feel like I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing if I'm not helping.
[02:44:13.289 --> 02:44:19.731]  Well, sir, I get about 50 people a day that want to volunteer, and I don't have the money or the infrastructure
[02:44:20.439 --> 02:44:24.561]  Or the system to put people to work, you know, who I would even pay.
[02:44:24.581 --> 02:44:25.682]  Right.
[02:44:25.822 --> 02:44:26.862]  Or have them volunteer.
[02:44:27.082 --> 02:44:33.105]  I would challenge you to start your own website, to start your own AXS TV show, to start your own local newspaper.
[02:44:33.706 --> 02:44:38.368]  I would challenge you to be a leader and to go out there and fight the new world order.
[02:44:38.508 --> 02:44:39.288]  That's what we need.
[02:44:39.348 --> 02:44:47.172]  We need more people to get out there, to use a military term, to force multiply, to go out and train and lead others.
[02:44:47.352 --> 02:44:47.712]  Absolutely.
[02:44:47.732 --> 02:44:48.633]  Well, that is my intention.
[02:44:49.246 --> 02:45:02.089]  I haven't had the guidance in the past, and most of the information I have has been gleaned through, you know, reading between the lines and listening between the lines of the media, and there's not many people out there that are as well-informed as you are and have a motivated agenda.
[02:45:02.449 --> 02:45:04.249]  I plan on doing that myself.
[02:45:04.329 --> 02:45:08.410]  It's just, you already, you know, you're such a motivating force.
[02:45:08.470 --> 02:45:10.210]  Well, I appreciate that, Jeff, but listen.
[02:45:11.191 --> 02:45:13.911]  My agenda is just getting people to think for themselves.
[02:45:14.091 --> 02:45:17.072]  My agenda is getting people to look around them and to analyze
[02:45:17.737 --> 02:45:24.820]  You know, the field of battle we're all on, and that's a corrupt crime syndicate using high-tech psychology against the population.
[02:45:25.720 --> 02:45:36.365]  But once you're conscious of the game, once you're conscious of the manipulative forces, and that whole integrated field, then it doesn't have power over you anymore.
[02:45:36.385 --> 02:45:37.365]  Well, absolutely.
[02:45:37.665 --> 02:45:38.906]  And that is my intention.
[02:45:39.246 --> 02:45:43.348]  Also, I have a large group of friends that are like-minded here in Austin.
[02:45:44.173 --> 02:45:49.996]  If you need, you know, a base group to come to, like, I didn't hear about the meeting last night until this morning, or I would have been there.
[02:45:50.597 --> 02:45:52.858]  Well, yeah, it was all organized for the moment.
[02:45:52.898 --> 02:46:03.304]  We had, I don't know, over a hundred people showed up at the telecommunications meeting, and they said, we're shutting down AXS TV, taking it over, taking over free speech, but we're not taking it over and not taking over free speech.
[02:46:03.644 --> 02:46:04.765]  You're a conspiracy terrorist!
[02:46:05.305 --> 02:46:11.809]  And then now, Melissa, who's a friend of mine, and who's volunteered, who I know well, so she saw it on local TV, they announced that it is happening.
[02:46:11.869 --> 02:46:12.009]  So,
[02:46:12.729 --> 02:46:14.150]  I mean, just new levels.
[02:46:14.210 --> 02:46:20.874]  Just stay tuned to the radio show, stay tuned to the TV show, and get involved in your community.
[02:46:21.835 --> 02:46:24.156]  That's the bottom line, my friend.
[02:46:24.316 --> 02:46:29.780]  Well, if it weren't for my experience in the military and also what happened to my father, I didn't find out until 20 years later after I got out.
[02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:36.464]  But if it weren't for that, it would be difficult for me to just accept some of the things that I've heard without
[02:46:36.923 --> 02:46:41.265]  You know, of course, you have a lot of information, you're backing up everything you said, and most people don't do that.
[02:46:41.306 --> 02:46:43.627]  But even then, even then, it's very difficult.
[02:46:43.707 --> 02:46:47.329]  I can see how it's difficult for the average American to ingest it.
[02:46:48.312 --> 02:46:54.917]  Well, a lot of us kind of have this apologetic attitude, like, I know it sounds weird, but the really bad stuff's going on.
[02:46:55.278 --> 02:47:10.209]  You've got to connect in a leadership mindset with people and go, listen, this is the truth, don't disregard what I'm saying until you've checked it out, look at me in the eye, you're being enslaved, you're being lied to, and you know in your guts it's true, now you better get out there and do something!
[02:47:10.569 --> 02:47:12.471]  And that's how you wake people up.
[02:47:12.731 --> 02:47:14.912]  Well, you've been an inspiration in my life, Alex.
[02:47:14.972 --> 02:47:15.632]  I appreciate it.
[02:47:15.652 --> 02:47:17.032]  I wanted to make sure you knew that.
[02:47:17.052 --> 02:47:17.492]  Well, listen.
[02:47:17.532 --> 02:47:26.415]  I mean, maybe sometimes you can't volunteer or get involved, but I would tell you to go down while it's still around, because the death process is going to take a year, and get your own AXS TV show and be your own leader.
[02:47:27.635 --> 02:47:29.756]  Well, you know... I know a lot of folks have done that, sir.
[02:47:30.076 --> 02:47:31.596]  I will definitely look into that.
[02:47:31.696 --> 02:47:34.237]  I plan on starting a website here very shortly.
[02:47:34.277 --> 02:47:34.517]  Good.
[02:47:35.017 --> 02:47:36.438]  You know, it's very important.
[02:47:36.838 --> 02:47:37.278]  Everything that's
[02:47:37.759 --> 02:47:46.082]  You know, it happened just focusing on what happened to the troops out in the first Gulf War and what's happening now and how, you know, it was absolutely an experiment.
[02:47:46.362 --> 02:47:48.863]  If you ask me, I was in an experimental situation.
[02:47:48.883 --> 02:47:50.043]  I was lied to about what it was.
[02:47:50.083 --> 02:47:52.044]  They said it was an anti-anthrax agent.
[02:47:52.404 --> 02:47:58.086]  Gave us pamphlets to scare us about anthrax and, you know, that it was a bovine disease and it's relatively harmless as far as the antidote.
[02:47:58.587 --> 02:47:59.787]  It's been used before, in other words.
[02:47:59.907 --> 02:48:05.269]  And this PB that they gave us was actually for anti-sarin gas and it wasn't, you know,
[02:48:05.794 --> 02:48:06.294]  It wasn't related.
[02:48:06.314 --> 02:48:09.016]  It was never approved by the FDA for use on humans before they gave it to us.
[02:48:09.596 --> 02:48:18.021]  And when I came back from the Gulf, I went to the VA for some general checkups and they put me through a battery of tests called the Persian Gulf Registry.
[02:48:19.962 --> 02:48:20.603]  I know, sir.
[02:48:20.663 --> 02:48:21.363]  It's horrible.
[02:48:21.403 --> 02:48:22.264]  Call me back sometime.
[02:48:22.284 --> 02:48:23.144]  We'll talk more about it.
[02:48:23.525 --> 02:48:30.789]  I'm going to hit a few final news stories on the other side and cover some other key stuff, so stay with us.
[02:48:31.923 --> 02:48:38.311]  I do want to thank everybody that came out to the meeting last night and I want to thank all of our affiliates AM and FM around the country.
[02:48:38.791 --> 02:48:41.114]  God bless you for what you're doing standing up for this country.
[02:48:46.974 --> 02:48:54.342]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:48:54.623 --> 02:48:59.368]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:48:59.588 --> 02:49:05.255]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:49:05.475 --> 02:49:09.997]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:49:10.217 --> 02:49:17.379]  The cashless society control grid, impenetrable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:49:17.399 --> 02:49:18.179]  soil, the U.S.A.
[02:49:18.219 --> 02:49:21.941]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.101 --> 02:49:24.602]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masses of terror.
[02:49:24.842 --> 02:49:31.544]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:49:58.924 --> 02:50:03.606]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:04.086 --> 02:50:10.811]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:11.211 --> 02:50:22.960]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:23.460 --> 02:50:27.924]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:51:48.687 --> 02:51:54.709]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.

[02:52:07.232 --> 02:52:11.213]  If your local AM or FM doesn't carry the nighttime show, ask them to.
[02:52:11.273 --> 02:52:11.973]  Ask them why not.
[02:52:12.753 --> 02:52:14.754]  Tell them thanks for picking up the daytime show and
[02:52:15.779 --> 02:52:22.361]  You can always listen on the internet at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or at GCNLive.com.
[02:52:22.401 --> 02:52:24.261]  This is the GCN radio network.

[02:52:37.828 --> 02:52:42.110]  I just briefly wanted to remind you that I've made two films about 9-11 that are excellent.
[02:52:42.150 --> 02:52:46.671]  I carry two other videos by George Humphrey and Eric Huffschmid on 9-11.
[02:52:47.771 --> 02:52:51.613]  And all four of these films, my two videos, their videos, are excellent.
[02:52:51.633 --> 02:52:52.413]  You need to have them.

[02:54:07.267 --> 02:54:11.450]  I found Capitol Hill Blue to be very accurate in the past eight, nine years I've been reading it.
[02:54:11.870 --> 02:54:15.352]  Bush using drugs to control depression, erratic behavior.
[02:54:15.372 --> 02:54:19.515]  It's like the fourth story I've seen on this from them.
[02:54:20.295 --> 02:54:27.820]  President George Bush is taking powerful antidepressant drugs to control his erratic behavior, depression, and paranoia, Capitol Hill Blue has learned.
[02:54:28.620 --> 02:54:31.282]  The prescription drugs, his father admits he's on them by the way,
[02:54:32.262 --> 02:54:45.290]  Uh, by Colonel Richard J. Tubb, the White House physician, can impair the President's mental faculties and decrease both his physical capabilities and his ability to respond to a crisis administration aides admit privately.
[02:54:45.810 --> 02:54:47.271]  It's a double-edged sword, says one.
[02:54:47.671 --> 02:54:54.475]  We can't have him flying off the handle of the slightest provocation, but we also need a president who is alert mentally.
[02:54:56.276 --> 02:54:58.998]  Angry Bush walked away from a reporter's questions.
[02:54:59.733 --> 02:55:13.137]  Tubbs prescribed, and there's a photo of that, Tubbs prescribed an antidepressant after a clearly upset Bush stormed off the stage on July 8th, refusing to answer reporters' questions about his relationship with indicted Enron executive Kenneth J. Lay.
[02:55:14.637 --> 02:55:18.518]  Keep those mother bleepers away from me, he screamed at an aide backstage.
[02:55:18.938 --> 02:55:20.739]  If you can't, I'll find someone who can.
[02:55:20.759 --> 02:55:24.220]  Okay.
[02:55:25.260 --> 02:55:26.801]  Everything they said about Bill Clinton was true.
[02:55:26.821 --> 02:55:27.941]  Now they say stuff about Bush.
[02:55:27.981 --> 02:55:28.381]  Is it true?
[02:55:29.173 --> 02:55:29.753]  I'd say so.
[02:55:29.813 --> 02:55:30.993]  Something's wrong with that puppy.
[02:55:32.114 --> 02:55:36.214]  Oil prices at a 21-year record as fears grow.
[02:55:36.294 --> 02:55:38.155]  Financial times of London.
[02:55:38.715 --> 02:55:42.035]  Oil prices surge at a 21-year high.
[02:55:42.055 --> 02:55:48.217]  A sharp increase came as Yukos, one of Russia's biggest oil companies, threatened to halt production.
[02:55:48.817 --> 02:55:55.978]  And concerns grew over whether the world's limited spare oil capacity would be able to satisfy growing demand in a tight market.
[02:55:57.563 --> 02:55:58.664]  You like being fleeced?
[02:55:58.684 --> 02:55:59.985]  They're fleecing you at every level.
[02:56:00.445 --> 02:56:03.487]  Saddam Hussein could be dead before trial, Al Jazeera reporting.
[02:56:04.508 --> 02:56:07.831]  His lawyers say that he is so sick that he could be dead before trial.
[02:56:07.891 --> 02:56:08.671]  How convenient!
[02:56:10.993 --> 02:56:12.914]  Alright, we're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:12.954 --> 02:56:26.965]  Again, back tonight, 9 to midnight, Central Standard Time, to our sponsors, our affiliates, the folks running the show, you, the listeners, and number one, to God Almighty, I am thankful and blessed to be your host,
[02:56:27.925 --> 02:56:32.393]  And I am so blessed to be alive and to be fighting the New World Order, and I know you are too.
[02:56:32.994 --> 02:56:34.276]  Take care, my friends!
