[00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:05.951]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.611 --> 00:00:07.691]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.392 --> 00:00:09.512]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.532 --> 00:00:10.972]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.713 --> 00:00:13.633]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.653 --> 00:00:16.954]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:21.596]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.616 --> 00:00:28.978]  Well, my friends, it's already Friday, the ninth day of 2004.
[00:00:33.536 --> 00:00:35.598]  And we're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:35.898 --> 00:00:46.908]  Coming up in about 30 minutes, we have Glenn Spencer from American Patrol, the premier expert on the globalist plan to surrender to the new world order by getting rid of our borders.
[00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.313]  Amnesty for all those that are here and anyone that ever gets here in perpetuity.
[00:00:53.715 --> 00:00:59.180]  And then we've got Joel Skousen to talk about the latest developments with 9-11 and government-sponsored terror.
[00:01:00.715 --> 00:01:06.767]  Of course, he's a former fighter pilot himself and will tell you how it's impossible for 19 hijackers to do what they did.
[00:01:06.787 --> 00:01:09.934]  It'd be impossible for 19 fighter pilots to do it.
[00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.835]  And then I've got Keith Parker from Texas Frontline coming on for 30 minutes and the third hour.
[00:01:19.135 --> 00:01:23.378]  Got a popular local TV show, part of Ranch Rescue, that's been under attack.
[00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:28.522]  Now to give you the Texas perspective on the end of the border and sovereignty.
[00:01:28.962 --> 00:01:37.228]  In the last 30 minutes, the latest info on Saddam Hussein supposedly having cancer and some of his top minions being killed in U.S.
[00:01:37.308 --> 00:01:38.628]  that is globalist custody.
[00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:40.670]  We're just controlled by the parasite like...
[00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:49.955]  We're good to go.
[00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.331]  Wake up, boys, there's a light at the window.
[00:02:14.211 --> 00:02:17.792]  I can hear someone knocking on the door.
[00:02:19.452 --> 00:02:24.113]  There are voices in the street and the sound of running feet.
[00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:27.794]  And they whisper the word, REVOLUTION.
[00:02:30.094 --> 00:02:34.055]  There are men coming down from the valley.
[00:02:35.916 --> 00:02:39.517]  There are tall ships flying off the coast.
[00:02:41.758 --> 00:02:46.720]  And they carry the light in the dark of the night.
[00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.701]  Like a whisper in the wind.
[00:02:49.721 --> 00:02:50.782]  Evolution!
[00:02:53.202 --> 00:02:57.284]  Bring my gun and a handful of silver.
[00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:02.686]  By the sea we will gather for the fight.
[00:03:05.154 --> 00:03:20.637]  It's been so many years So many tears We have lost once before Now we'll settle the score When our cannons will roar Revolution!
[00:03:33.434 --> 00:03:36.376]  Alright folks, Alex Jones back live.
[00:03:36.877 --> 00:03:45.283]  When I got to the studio today I noticed the phone company was doing something with the different digital lines and there's no one from the phone company outside the office.
[00:03:45.303 --> 00:03:49.105]  There's just a black wire strung running right along the side of my office.
[00:03:50.086 --> 00:03:54.049]  So that's the connection up to Minnesota and the folks running the show and the satellite uplinks.
[00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.452]  We'll see if we're able to have the show today and have Glenn Spencer on and
[00:03:59.456 --> 00:04:04.778]  To have Joel Skousen and Keith Parker and of course Paul Watson.
[00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.021]  And if we keep having problems, I'm going to jump in the car and drive 80 miles an hour to the other studio.
[00:04:12.021 --> 00:04:15.903]  This never happens once or twice a year and now it's happening and I'm beginning to think it's deliberate.
[00:04:16.943 --> 00:04:21.625]  In fact, the British media caught it on tape about three years ago.
[00:04:22.545 --> 00:04:26.447]  They were here in Austin and there were people that quote, didn't work for the phone company
[00:04:27.359 --> 00:04:32.261]  Continually in the big box down the road, every day when I went on the air.
[00:04:32.461 --> 00:04:36.663]  So, one day I was running a song, I went on air, drove down and caught the guy in there.
[00:04:37.384 --> 00:04:42.566]  Another time I had somebody walk up the side of the studio, and there was just a cut wire out there.
[00:04:42.586 --> 00:04:45.407]  They just cut the digital line.
[00:04:46.608 --> 00:04:48.489]  Oh, yeah, there's not a New World Order, folks.
[00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:52.130]  There's no such thing as that.
[00:04:53.391 --> 00:04:55.872]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.394]  Hey everybody, let me talk to you about your weight for a minute.
[00:05:03.454 --> 00:05:13.322]  How many of you have tried the fad diets, you've tried the pills, you've tried counting calories, you've even tried other nighttime weight loss formulas and nothing seems to be working?
[00:05:13.583 --> 00:05:14.583]  You know what I suggest to you?
[00:05:14.984 --> 00:05:20.648]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:29.356]  Call Vim and Vigor today at 1-800-622-THIN and they have people standing by to answer your questions about how to lose weight the safe and healthy way.
[00:05:29.856 --> 00:05:31.417]  No ephedra, no stimulants.
[00:05:31.477 --> 00:05:37.341]  VeminVigor's Collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[00:05:37.401 --> 00:05:38.661]  This is the real deal, folks.
[00:05:38.721 --> 00:05:41.343]  VeminVigor's Collagenate really does work.
[00:05:41.503 --> 00:05:42.484]  It's healthy for you, too.
[00:05:42.644 --> 00:05:49.268]  In addition to helping you lose weight, Collagenate is also designed to improve strength and health of muscles, joints, skin, hair, and nails.
[00:05:49.408 --> 00:05:51.389]  So take Collagenate and rejuvenate.
[00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:52.490]  Call VeminVigor today.
[00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.750]  1-800-622-FIN.
[00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.970]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[00:06:00.254 --> 00:06:03.495]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:03.575 --> 00:06:07.756]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:07.997 --> 00:06:10.797]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:10.978 --> 00:06:13.378]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:13.578 --> 00:06:22.221]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:23.762]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:06:23.962 --> 00:06:28.063]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:06:28.083 --> 00:06:28.884]  We're good to go!
[00:06:47.421 --> 00:06:49.723]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[00:07:04.113 --> 00:07:05.414]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:07:05.614 --> 00:07:11.356]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest, most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:07:11.636 --> 00:07:16.877]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:07:17.158 --> 00:07:21.279]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:25.283]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:07:25.544 --> 00:07:30.169]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:07:30.269 --> 00:07:36.536]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:07:36.576 --> 00:07:38.398]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:07:38.878 --> 00:07:40.959]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny today.
[00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:44.400]  Call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.441]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:48.181 --> 00:07:52.583]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[00:07:52.683 --> 00:07:54.664]  You see Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[00:07:54.904 --> 00:07:56.424]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:56.604 --> 00:07:58.685]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:08:00.538 --> 00:08:05.580]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.280]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:17.383 --> 00:08:28.606]  Coming to you, deep in the heart of Texas, right down the road from the Hollywood stage, the Bush Ranch, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.987 --> 00:08:29.907]  And again, we have
[00:08:30.794 --> 00:08:34.287]  Glenn Spencer from American Patrol to talk about Bush's high treason.
[00:08:35.131 --> 00:08:39.752]  And the total capitulation to getting rid of our national sovereignty, that's what this is.
[00:08:40.152 --> 00:08:42.212]  This giant, unlimited amnesty.
[00:08:42.733 --> 00:08:48.074]  Then we have Joel Skousen to talk about September 11th, the latest developments in the police state.
[00:08:48.814 --> 00:08:57.376]  Then we've got a local activist, good friend of mine, Keith Parker, host of a TV show, Texas Frontline, talking about the open border situation.
[00:08:57.716 --> 00:09:04.197]  And the last 30 minutes of the show, Paul Joseph Watson with the latest developments on Princess Diana and a lot more.
[00:09:07.077 --> 00:09:09.818]  Bush plans major space announcement.
[00:09:09.858 --> 00:09:18.619]  Now, remember, he was going to announce this last month on the 100th anniversary of Kitty Hawk and the Wright Brothers, but for some reason didn't.
[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.160]  But now Bush to announce missions to Mars and the Moon.
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:30.782]  Now, we already heard this once from the White House, so they may delay it again, but they're already making rumblings about it.
[00:09:31.698 --> 00:09:34.380]  Also, Bush immigration plan borders on treason.
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:39.783]  That's from Chuck Baldwin, one of our writers at PrisonPlanet.com, also a great talk show host in his own right.
[00:09:40.623 --> 00:09:45.506]  It doesn't border on it, it is treason by the very definition, and we're all witnesses to it.
[00:09:45.967 --> 00:09:47.468]  You've got to have two witnesses to treason.
[00:09:47.508 --> 00:09:51.930]  We've got millions who saw that disgusting announcement he made two days ago.
[00:09:52.491 --> 00:09:53.891]  White House wants U.N.
[00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:55.012]  to return to Iraq.
[00:09:55.212 --> 00:09:56.133]  Folks, I read
[00:09:56.753 --> 00:10:03.900]  The different news articles before the Iraq War, where it was all wink-wink with the United Nations.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.985]  We're going to go in, play the part of the bad cop, then you'll come in as the good cop later, and they'll thank you for occupation.
[00:10:11.295 --> 00:10:13.538]  And that's exactly what they're now doing.
[00:10:13.598 --> 00:10:15.640]  Again, Javier Solano, the former U.N.
[00:10:17.122 --> 00:10:19.946]  chief, and then of course one of the chiefs there at the E.U.
[00:10:20.687 --> 00:10:28.276]  is now one of their top ambassadors, said what about a month ago that, oh, I've already met with the White House officials, the E.U.
[00:10:28.316 --> 00:10:28.837]  and the U.N.
[00:10:28.857 --> 00:10:30.699]  will be taking over Iraq in the next year.
[00:10:31.613 --> 00:10:32.714]  So we've got that.
[00:10:32.834 --> 00:10:33.395]  Also, U.S.
[00:10:33.415 --> 00:10:36.657]  military deaths in Iraq approach 500.
[00:10:37.138 --> 00:10:40.080]  Chances of weapons of mass destruction find slipping.
[00:10:40.641 --> 00:10:42.522]  Defense Minister Robert Hill says that.
[00:10:43.243 --> 00:10:44.384]  Also, U.S.
[00:10:44.424 --> 00:10:46.566]  military becoming desperate in Iraq.
[00:10:47.944 --> 00:10:52.348]  Tactical evolution of tactical desperation, and the U.S.
[00:10:52.388 --> 00:10:54.550]  begins huge Iraq forces switch.
[00:10:54.590 --> 00:11:07.782]  They're rotating out a lot of the troops and rotating in new ones to breathe the 1,900 times safe levels of depleted uranium, and to have Shiites and Sunnis and everybody else taking hot shots at them, but hey!
[00:11:07.802 --> 00:11:12.246]  You know, the President says, bring them on, you know, bring on the casualties.
[00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.851]  Also, Powell says no smoking guns showing terrorist ties in Iraq.
[00:11:17.291 --> 00:11:19.092]  But again, he always plays the good cop.
[00:11:19.352 --> 00:11:21.773]  Later he'll come in and go, OK, it was true.
[00:11:22.093 --> 00:11:23.633]  Here's the weapons of mass destruction.
[00:11:24.014 --> 00:11:25.334]  I think that's still up their sleeve.
[00:11:25.594 --> 00:11:39.178]  But don't worry, a man we can trust, a good person, about ten times last year came to Bush's aid in big television interviews saying he was right to invade Iraq, that there are weapons of mass destruction.
[00:11:39.218 --> 00:11:40.799]  And this is somebody that never lies.
[00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:46.273]  He's the guy that said I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky, and shook his finger at us.
[00:11:46.953 --> 00:11:53.217]  And looked about as guilty as a cat with its arm in the fish tank.
[00:11:53.277 --> 00:12:00.761]  He looked about as guilty as Bush when he said we will not tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the September 11th attacks.
[00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:03.683]  Yeah, you mean that your bosses did it?
[00:12:04.443 --> 00:12:06.745]  Everybody's starting to find out about that, buddy.
[00:12:06.785 --> 00:12:07.585]  You're in a lot of trouble.
[00:12:07.925 --> 00:12:10.847]  But Clinton believes Iraq had weapons of mass destruction!
[00:12:12.193 --> 00:12:14.415]  Yes, Clinton's out stumping for Bush again.
[00:12:14.716 --> 00:12:16.037]  Hillary stumped for the war.
[00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:20.362]  I told you, Democrats, if you like Bill Clinton, you should love George Bush.
[00:12:21.603 --> 00:12:34.897]  Open borders, gun control, more regulation, biggest growth in government ever, signed on to UNESCO, supercomputers of communist China, doubled many of the program's funding for the Department of Education, Department of Transportation,
[00:12:35.925 --> 00:12:37.868]  The government has grown by 45% in the last three years.
[00:12:38.329 --> 00:12:40.413]  It grew by 24% last year alone.
[00:12:40.433 --> 00:12:41.935]  So the growth is accelerating.
[00:12:51.488 --> 00:12:52.949]  The growth is accelerating.
[00:12:52.989 --> 00:12:55.071]  I'm going to agree by what, 9% his first year?
[00:12:55.711 --> 00:12:59.935]  I think they said 12 or 14%, I don't have the numbers in front of me, in 2000.
[00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:03.438]  Folks, this is getting scary.
[00:13:03.478 --> 00:13:08.222]  So a lot of the growth was when Clinton was leaving, then Bush comes in, it grows, and it grows even more.
[00:13:08.542 --> 00:13:12.645]  The last three years, 40 plus percent growth in the size of the government.
[00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:17.189]  Also, report Saddam Hussein has cancer!
[00:13:18.507 --> 00:13:30.195]  Report, Saddam Hussein has cancer, and this was announced on some of the Asian television channels in Taiwan and other areas, and we did find a news article out of the Sophie Morning News.
[00:13:30.635 --> 00:13:33.837]  Report, Saddam Hussein has cancer.
[00:13:33.897 --> 00:13:40.442]  The al-Sadraki dictator, who is currently under custody with the coalition forces, suffers from cancer of lymph glands.
[00:13:41.641 --> 00:13:43.683]  Oh, of course it's super fast and terminal.
[00:13:44.023 --> 00:13:55.512]  Kuwaiti Al Na'ab Daily reads, citing an Iraq official, according to the Daily, the disease is in an advanced stage, so doctors predict the former dictator would probably live a couple of years more.
[00:13:55.992 --> 00:14:03.838]  Doctors came out with the fatal diagnosis while making thorough medical checks of Saddam Hussein, and is captured near the hometown of Tikrit in December 2003.
[00:14:05.419 --> 00:14:15.902]  Allegations of Saddam Hussein's illness appeared during the military campaign in Iraq last year, when one of his private doctors residing in Syria claimed that the former dictator suffered from cancer.
[00:14:16.362 --> 00:14:17.243]  Oh, how convenient.
[00:14:17.263 --> 00:14:23.584]  Just like in about a week and a half after the announcement Jack Ruby dropped dead from super-fast cancer.
[00:14:23.604 --> 00:14:29.746]  Kind of like the Shah was fine and got flown into England and died real quick of that fast cancer.
[00:14:29.806 --> 00:14:31.787]  But I'm sure he really does have it.
[00:14:32.788 --> 00:14:35.591]  Yes, just a coincidence of course, of course it is.
[00:14:36.432 --> 00:14:42.899]  Also, unofficial sources to Al-Bawaba, Saddam's presidential secretary, dies in U.S.
[00:14:42.959 --> 00:14:43.480]  custody.
[00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:48.996]  And there are many reports here of them killing people with electric shocks.
[00:14:49.136 --> 00:14:51.798]  So powerful they're killing them, they're putting them into comas.
[00:14:52.358 --> 00:14:54.959]  Hey, torture is in all the new dramas on TV.
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.020]  It's chic.
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:03.364]  It's like the latest hairstyle or clothing push.
[00:15:03.464 --> 00:15:04.605]  It's just wonderful.
[00:15:04.705 --> 00:15:06.026]  It's torture chic.
[00:15:07.868 --> 00:15:15.360]  And it says Iraqi security officials contacted by Al-Bawaba declined to comment on the report but have not denied it either.
[00:15:16.364 --> 00:15:21.405]  Al Tikriti was taken into custody on the 18th of June 2003.
[00:15:22.026 --> 00:15:28.547]  Abeb Hammound was considered one of Saddam's closest aides and controlled access to the president.
[00:15:28.927 --> 00:15:33.989]  He was said to have directed matters of state and handed down many of the Assad regime's orders.
[00:15:34.089 --> 00:15:35.449]  Upon his capture, U.S.
[00:15:35.489 --> 00:15:41.651]  authorities claimed Abeb Hammound possessed vital information about Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction.
[00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:47.315]  Since his detention, reports in the Arabic press have claimed he was tortured by U.S.
[00:15:47.355 --> 00:15:52.619]  investigators to pressure him to provide information on weapons development programs.
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:16:02.826]  And this new photo released by Saddam, because it would be totally illegal to release a photo of a prisoner of war being beat up, so they accidentally released it.
[00:16:03.086 --> 00:16:05.768]  Some soldier did, but everybody wanted to see it.
[00:16:05.828 --> 00:16:09.171]  Saddam with a knee on his head and obvious pain down on the floor.
[00:16:11.683 --> 00:16:14.866]  I had a phone company guy at my house the other day fixing one of the lines.
[00:16:17.109 --> 00:16:21.953]  He saw my shirt and said, Axis of Evil with a picture of Bush, Rumsfeld and Cheney.
[00:16:22.474 --> 00:16:24.716]  He said, I'm glad they got Saddam.
[00:16:24.756 --> 00:16:26.858]  I hope they feed him in a wood chipper.
[00:16:28.199 --> 00:16:32.123]  I said, but wouldn't we become Saddam Hussein if we started feeding people into wood chippers?
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.261]  By the way, that woodchipper story's not true.
[00:16:35.641 --> 00:16:37.923]  The story about the babies in the incubator aren't true.
[00:16:37.983 --> 00:16:39.003]  That's admitted, by the way.
[00:16:39.544 --> 00:16:43.326]  A US PR firm just brought forward a fake witness and did that.
[00:16:43.466 --> 00:16:44.567]  That's admitted, by the way.
[00:16:46.728 --> 00:16:48.609]  So, I'm not defending Saddam Hussein.
[00:16:48.649 --> 00:16:49.650]  He did brutal things.
[00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:54.653]  He was trained in assassination torture from the age of 19 in 1954.
[00:16:55.253 --> 00:16:58.875]  A very honored member of the New World Order.
[00:16:58.915 --> 00:17:00.156]  Did a lot of good work for him.
[00:17:01.008 --> 00:17:02.749]  There in Iraq, very bloodthirsty.
[00:17:02.809 --> 00:17:04.430]  Attacked the Iranians under orders.
[00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:08.712]  Went into Kuwait under the US saying, yeah, go ahead, we support you.
[00:17:09.452 --> 00:17:20.098]  We're supposed to forget about all that, but the point here is, and it's very, very important that we understand this, is that most of what you're told about these guys is totally not true.
[00:17:21.959 --> 00:17:25.281]  But, that doesn't seem to matter nowadays, does it?
[00:17:25.981 --> 00:17:28.182]  I'm a liberal because I'm against open borders.
[00:17:28.442 --> 00:17:29.903]  I'm a liberal because I'm for guns.
[00:17:30.905 --> 00:17:36.926]  I would be a conservative if I wore a red armband and a Soviet Red Star on my cap.
[00:17:37.587 --> 00:17:38.827]  And again, I'm not being sarcastic.
[00:17:38.987 --> 00:17:48.509]  You know, if I had cut Taiwan loose, if I had changed a 53-year treaty with them, if I would have sold America out, I would be a wonderful person.
[00:17:48.529 --> 00:17:49.029]  But I'm bad.
[00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:49.729]  I'm for America.
[00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:52.130]  And I'm for the facts, too, you know?
[00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:53.250]  I'm not a hypocrite.
[00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:54.791]  But again, that's a bad thing nowadays.
[00:17:56.191 --> 00:17:58.311]  Southern Thailand's under martial law.
[00:17:58.351 --> 00:18:00.372]  There's also a very scary development here.
[00:18:01.383 --> 00:18:02.143]  You know, the U.N.'
[00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:04.344]  's already basically running Canada's courts.
[00:18:05.344 --> 00:18:12.985]  Well, now they are officially running the police and, yes, the courts in Guatemala.
[00:18:14.945 --> 00:18:18.686]  Oh, but don't worry, the left's all behind it because it's to punish right-wingers.
[00:18:18.766 --> 00:18:20.306]  Folks, it's all good cop, bad cop.
[00:18:22.667 --> 00:18:27.628]  And they now are going to have their own little U.N.
[00:18:27.808 --> 00:18:29.868]  communist-run, banker-funded,
[00:18:31.673 --> 00:18:33.494]  Inquisition in Guatemala.
[00:18:34.535 --> 00:18:37.137]  The more things change, the more they stay the same.
[00:18:37.177 --> 00:18:54.188]  But again, Southern Thailand under martial law, just as residents of Southern Thailand thought the New Year had come peacefully in spite of holiday terrorism alert, a series of coordinated terror attacks has prompted the government to impose martial law and has renewed fears of resurgent Islamic separatism in the region.
[00:18:55.328 --> 00:18:59.291]  Now folks, in Thailand, in
[00:19:00.832 --> 00:19:13.751]  East Timor, which of course is a unit of this whole global system, a holding basically taken from Indonesia.
[00:19:14.858 --> 00:19:22.803]  And in Indonesia proper, the government admittedly has been caught, over the last 50 years, blowing stuff up to blame it on their enemies and have crackdowns.
[00:19:23.183 --> 00:19:25.244]  And the evidence is that's happening here again.
[00:19:25.724 --> 00:19:27.625]  Al-Qaeda not behind Thai violence.
[00:19:28.226 --> 00:19:41.353]  A wave of violence in mainly Muslim southern Thailand is inspired by money and nationalism and shows skin evidence that links to a wider network with some of Bin Laden's Al-Qaeda and it's Jehama Islamah, an Asian affiliate.
[00:19:43.999 --> 00:19:48.302]  Folks, I haven't even scratched the surface here, and I want to get back into this Moon-Mars mission.
[00:19:48.922 --> 00:19:50.403]  You thought it'd just be back to the Moon.
[00:19:50.423 --> 00:19:51.684]  Well, now it's back to Mars.
[00:19:51.704 --> 00:19:54.806]  We've never been there, so... I guess it's two Mars!
[00:19:55.266 --> 00:19:56.086]  Back to the Moon!

[00:23:02.343 --> 00:23:03.864]  Are you having an energy crisis?
[00:23:04.204 --> 00:23:06.846]  No, I'm not talking about the rising cost of gasoline.
[00:23:07.086 --> 00:23:08.967]  I'm talking about you, personally.
[00:23:09.247 --> 00:23:12.189]  Do you have the energy you need to do all the things in life that you need to do?
[00:23:12.489 --> 00:23:14.310]  If you're like most people, the answer is no.
[00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:18.372]  And that extra cup of coffee or an afternoon candy bar is not the solution.

[00:24:01.616 --> 00:24:06.760]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.842]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:11.383 --> 00:24:15.086]  Again, we've got Spencer coming up about Bush's treason.
[00:24:15.747 --> 00:24:21.991]  Imagine if Bill Clinton said all illegals will be legal in perpetuity, whoever's here, whoever gets here.
[00:24:23.232 --> 00:24:25.994]  And then tried to say it's not amnesty, it's reform.
[00:24:26.515 --> 00:24:30.377]  How the neocons would howl, but I've been listening to
[00:24:31.744 --> 00:24:35.426]  Last night I monitored while I was stuck in traffic through the TV studio and back.
[00:24:36.826 --> 00:24:57.536]  I guess it was about an hour and a half in the car, I listened to a Hannity refeed, a Limbaugh refeed, some other stuff, and it was, yeah, this isn't too good, but he's just beating the Democrats, it's politics, man, he's cunning, and callers were calling in, going, yeah, actually, I gotta give it to Bush, this is a great idea, and I heard that idiot Clark Howard
[00:24:58.911 --> 00:25:03.674]  The financial guy, how wonderful this is and how good this will be for our economy.
[00:25:04.134 --> 00:25:08.697]  Oh yeah, NAFTA and GATT and the 25 million illegals has been real good for the country.
[00:25:09.157 --> 00:25:10.318]  Wages being driven down.
[00:25:10.358 --> 00:25:12.359]  They talk about how they take jobs nobody wants.
[00:25:12.819 --> 00:25:26.267]  It's because the illegals 5, 10 to a house or apartment, and folks believe me that's how it works, don't pay into the taxes, don't have the safety net, aren't invested, and
[00:25:27.671 --> 00:25:39.194]  What they do is they drive down the wages so no one who's part of the system or no one who is trying to be lower middle class can take those jobs and be successful.
[00:25:40.055 --> 00:25:41.795]  And I've read the IMF World Bank plans.
[00:25:41.835 --> 00:25:42.975]  I've read the Globalist documents.
[00:25:43.215 --> 00:25:48.397]  I've read the Ford Foundation stuff that came out in the 70s in hearings about the big foundations.
[00:25:49.068 --> 00:25:54.470]  The plan is to balkanize and turn America into a third world country and lower our standard of living.
[00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:57.731]  That's what NAFTA and GATT and the EU and all of it's about.
[00:25:57.831 --> 00:25:59.772]  I've heard them brag about it on NPR.
[00:26:00.612 --> 00:26:03.914]  You know, we've got to lower our standard down to everybody else.
[00:26:03.934 --> 00:26:05.574]  We've been living outside our means.
[00:26:05.934 --> 00:26:09.936]  Yeah, we were living outside our means because it was a free country and it produced milk and honey.
[00:26:10.236 --> 00:26:17.939]  Now the parasites of the elite have knocked down the gates to let the barbarians pour in to overflow and take over the middle class.
[00:26:20.046 --> 00:26:22.768]  And Bush says it's for politics because the Hispanics want it.
[00:26:23.268 --> 00:26:26.990]  The major polls, the vast majority of Hispanics are against it.
[00:26:27.431 --> 00:26:30.593]  There are only a few poll points below blacks and whites.
[00:26:32.114 --> 00:26:32.914]  And you know why?
[00:26:32.934 --> 00:26:34.535]  Because they're not stupid.
[00:26:35.255 --> 00:26:36.216]  They're smart.
[00:26:37.237 --> 00:26:38.778]  I wish the yuppies were that smart.
[00:26:38.878 --> 00:26:42.500]  They sit there and know that the illegals are working for three, four bucks an hour illegally.
[00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.021]  They can't even get eight bucks.
[00:26:46.053 --> 00:26:47.675]  It's unbelievable, folks.
[00:26:48.215 --> 00:26:50.658]  But again, the spin is, ooh, great political move.
[00:26:50.718 --> 00:26:52.720]  All the liberal papers, like the L.A.
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:53.981]  Times, are praising Bush.
[00:26:54.662 --> 00:26:57.505]  And you see, you've got a problem, folks, when the Democrats are praising Bush.
[00:26:58.225 --> 00:27:00.107]  And like I said, Democrats, you should love Bush.
[00:27:00.508 --> 00:27:01.729]  So Glenn Spencer's coming up.
[00:27:03.303 --> 00:27:05.144]  Then we've got Joel Skousen, you don't want to miss that.
[00:27:05.164 --> 00:27:09.767]  Then we've got Keith Parker for the Texas View on the border for 30 minutes of the third hour.
[00:27:09.947 --> 00:27:10.968]  Then Paul Watson.
[00:27:11.088 --> 00:27:16.451]  It is a jam-packed broadcast for you today.
[00:27:17.472 --> 00:27:30.019]  Before I end this segment, and again we've got the Moon mission news and all this other stuff coming up, I really do want to encourage every single listener out there to stop procrastinating and to get involved in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:27:30.819 --> 00:27:33.640]  Put an InfoWars.com bumper sticker on your car.
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.701]  We've got them at InfoWars.com.
[00:27:36.381 --> 00:27:37.162]  Get my videos.
[00:27:37.242 --> 00:27:38.102]  Make copies of them.
[00:27:38.142 --> 00:27:39.042]  Put them on Access.
[00:27:39.082 --> 00:27:40.163]  Give them to opinion makers.
[00:27:41.363 --> 00:27:43.244]  Tell ten people a day about this show.
[00:27:43.944 --> 00:27:47.826]  Whether you're listening on an AM or FM station, shortwave, internet, satellite.
[00:27:49.347 --> 00:27:52.088]  Please spread the word now.
[00:27:52.308 --> 00:27:55.129]  It is so vitally important.
[00:27:55.409 --> 00:27:56.309]  Pay it forward.
[00:27:56.329 --> 00:27:57.810]  It's a geometric growth rate.
[00:27:58.436 --> 00:28:00.861]  That's why tens of millions of people now know the truth.
[00:28:01.974 --> 00:28:05.196]  I've made Matrix of Evil, my new video, a little over two hours.
[00:28:05.296 --> 00:28:11.780]  Ron Paul, Cynthia McKinney, Colonel Roberts, Frank Morales, myself, and folks are just loving the film.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:16.704]  It's speeches, it's interviews, it's news clips, it's documents, it's a great video.
[00:28:16.744 --> 00:28:20.806]  It shows us throwing the Patriot Act out in Austin in the first 15 minutes of the film.
[00:28:21.447 --> 00:28:22.607]  I confront the Deputy U.S.
[00:28:22.647 --> 00:28:25.069]  Attorney, call him a liar, then put up the U.S.
[00:28:25.109 --> 00:28:27.530]  Code on the screen as I say the U.S.
[00:28:27.571 --> 00:28:29.632]  Code to him, showing he's a liar.
[00:28:30.385 --> 00:28:41.010]  Just get Matrix of Evil, get Masters of Terror, get Police State 3 Total Enslavement, get 9-11 Road to Tyranny, 170 minutes on DVD, 144 minutes on VHS.

[00:29:41.275 --> 00:29:41.996]  Get the books.
[00:29:42.417 --> 00:29:43.918]  We offer so much on the side.
[00:29:43.938 --> 00:29:46.261]  We've got like 40 items now we offer.
[00:29:47.002 --> 00:29:47.883]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:47.923 --> 00:29:48.483]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.246 --> 00:29:52.147]  We're on the march.

[00:30:01.081 --> 00:30:02.482]  Did you know you've been cheated?
[00:30:02.542 --> 00:30:05.284]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[00:30:05.484 --> 00:30:06.304]  You heard that right.
[00:30:06.364 --> 00:30:08.986]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[00:30:09.146 --> 00:30:10.187]  You don't have to pay them off.
[00:30:10.427 --> 00:30:11.868]  The banks are defrauding you.
[00:30:12.128 --> 00:30:13.529]  Now is the time to fight back.
[00:30:13.769 --> 00:30:16.311]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.

[00:31:01.946 --> 00:31:04.166]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[00:31:04.607 --> 00:31:08.948]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[00:31:09.228 --> 00:31:15.049]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:19.310]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:25.251]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[00:31:25.371 --> 00:31:27.972]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[00:31:30.092 --> 00:31:33.614]  By mid-1983, it was close to $500 mounts.
[00:31:33.714 --> 00:31:36.395]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[00:31:36.755 --> 00:31:39.036]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[00:31:39.437 --> 00:31:43.058]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[00:31:43.539 --> 00:31:49.722]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[00:31:50.182 --> 00:31:51.162]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:31:51.502 --> 00:31:51.943]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:31:51.963 --> 00:31:52.203]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:32:00.319 --> 00:32:02.820]  Some people know all about drinking and driving.
[00:32:03.901 --> 00:32:16.287]  I would often leave a bar and I remember going out to the car and I remember then winding up in bed at home, but I don't remember any of the middle, how I got there.
[00:32:17.168 --> 00:32:25.832]  I know that at certain times I would simply use the center line as an aiming device with the ornament on the hood.
[00:32:26.804 --> 00:32:30.346]  And just really aim the car, not actually seeing where I was going.
[00:32:31.506 --> 00:32:43.271]  The real tragedy, of course, in a situation like that is not what you can do to yourself, but what you could do to someone who is either bicycling on the road or walking along the road.
[00:32:44.012 --> 00:32:46.573]  In my case, I just simply often did not see them.
[00:32:47.853 --> 00:32:54.396]  Some people don't decide how they're going to get home until they're incapable of making a responsible decision.
[00:32:55.397 --> 00:32:56.117]  Are you one of them?
[00:32:56.869 --> 00:32:58.091]  Brought to you by MAD.
[00:32:58.352 --> 00:32:59.854]  Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
[00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:09.451]  A nation is not a nation.
[00:33:09.631 --> 00:33:14.955]  It's not a country, a sovereign entity, unless it has borders.
[00:33:15.075 --> 00:33:18.317]  I have lived my entire life in Texas.
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:45.845]  My ancestors fought and died and are on the memorial fighting the Mexican dictator Santa Ana.
[00:33:48.566 --> 00:34:00.093]  And when you go to Mexico, if you look like you have money, in some of the tourist areas they leave you alone down south on the coast, but if you go down south over the Texas border,
[00:34:00.757 --> 00:34:01.858]  You'll be treated with hatred.
[00:34:01.878 --> 00:34:04.061]  You'll be called names by the police.
[00:34:04.221 --> 00:34:06.104]  They will rape your wife right in front of you.
[00:34:06.424 --> 00:34:07.485]  They will beat you up.
[00:34:08.026 --> 00:34:09.448]  They will take you to the jail.
[00:34:09.488 --> 00:34:12.311]  They will extort hundreds of thousands of dollars out of you.
[00:34:13.332 --> 00:34:14.274]  This is what they do.
[00:34:14.534 --> 00:34:19.260]  In fact, almost everyone I know has been rousted, has been harried, has been fed on.
[00:34:21.491 --> 00:34:25.633]  If you try to come to their country illegal, you're lucky if they don't kick your guts out.
[00:34:25.673 --> 00:34:27.554]  But that's okay, that's loving and good.
[00:34:27.574 --> 00:34:38.860]  You're not going to find the ACLU or the Southern Poverty Law Center going after the corrupt officials over there, or the narco-terrorists that the government controls.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:39.960]  No, it's not going to happen.
[00:34:41.241 --> 00:34:44.202]  And we have over 25 million illegals in this country right now.
[00:34:45.503 --> 00:34:47.644]  By the time they get their families here, it'll be 60 million.
[00:34:48.524 --> 00:34:49.905]  We're talking in just the next few years.
[00:34:51.661 --> 00:34:54.304]  California has fallen to this third world invasion.
[00:34:55.305 --> 00:34:58.489]  We talk about Latin America all the time because that's 80% of the influx.
[00:34:58.529 --> 00:35:06.398]  We've got the Russians, the Chinese, the Eastern Bloc, GM, Ford bring in the illegals who used to work in the Soviet weapons factories.
[00:35:06.478 --> 00:35:10.863]  They now run and are in the majority of many plants building the cars here.
[00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:15.731]  It's about the race to the bottom, sacrificing America on the altar of globalism.
[00:35:15.851 --> 00:35:17.772]  And, you know, I've got the headlines here.
[00:35:18.252 --> 00:35:19.992]  Bush actions border on treason.
[00:35:20.052 --> 00:35:20.993]  No, they are treason.
[00:35:21.313 --> 00:35:22.673]  Bun Spencer says it the best.
[00:35:23.433 --> 00:35:31.495]  This is surrender to Mexico, but more than surrender to Mexico, to the UN and the globalist model where there are no borders, there is no sovereignty.
[00:35:31.555 --> 00:35:33.816]  This is the Pan-American Union.
[00:35:34.816 --> 00:35:40.838]  And there are hundreds and hundreds of millions of Latin Americans coming this way, tens of millions of new births each year.
[00:35:41.718 --> 00:35:50.145]  Our government flies in the Somalis, flies in folks from all over the world to take jobs nobody wants.
[00:35:50.225 --> 00:36:00.553]  Yeah, after people come in who will live ten to a house and drive down the wage, who are someone who's part of the system and pays taxes, can't afford it, you bet they don't want those jobs.
[00:36:01.293 --> 00:36:05.617]  A meatpacker ten years ago got twenty bucks an hour, now they're lucky if they get seven or eight.
[00:36:06.437 --> 00:36:07.558]  It's all illegals.
[00:36:08.299 --> 00:36:10.941]  And it's not just the illegals, it's the prison labor we compete against.
[00:36:11.491 --> 00:36:29.464]  So here to talk with us for the next 25 minutes about this high treason and how the neocons are trying to spin this, oh it's just political, is Glenn Spencer of AmericanPatrol.com, the premier organization, no compromise, telling it like it is.
[00:36:29.544 --> 00:36:30.425]  Glenn, good to have you on.
[00:36:30.685 --> 00:36:31.746]  Alex, good to talk to you again.
[00:36:34.016 --> 00:36:41.621]  You know, we've been desensitized to this over the years, knowing that they were planning to... This isn't like the embassies of the past, where they just give amnesty to those that are here.
[00:36:41.661 --> 00:36:43.122]  This is everybody in perpetuity.
[00:36:44.283 --> 00:36:51.168]  But this is finally getting the dumbbells to wake up, but now the neocons, some of them, are trying to pacify them.
[00:36:51.789 --> 00:36:54.731]  Give us the picture of what's going on.
[00:36:55.611 --> 00:36:58.673]  Well, I think, you know, we saw it coming.
[00:36:58.734 --> 00:37:01.756]  We saw the trial balloons drifting through the clouds.
[00:37:03.973 --> 00:37:10.215]  Secretary of Homeland Security, Rich, a few weeks ago said that these people should be legalized.
[00:37:10.255 --> 00:37:11.236]  We knew it was coming.
[00:37:12.036 --> 00:37:16.358]  Actually, I knew it right after George Bush was elected.
[00:37:17.098 --> 00:37:28.182]  When he said, we have to make, and this was in the newspapers, three years ago, this month, he said, we have to make migration safe and orderly.
[00:37:28.242 --> 00:37:30.643]  When I read that, I knew we were all in trouble.
[00:37:31.443 --> 00:37:33.264]  Since illegal immigration,
[00:37:33.832 --> 00:37:35.873]  It's already safe and orderly.
[00:37:36.653 --> 00:37:41.215]  As I said at the time, he only could be talking about illegal immigration.
[00:37:42.135 --> 00:37:53.399]  And that, at the time, three years ago, told me that George Bush was an open borders globalist, ready to sacrifice the country on the altar of globalism.
[00:37:54.219 --> 00:37:54.999]  And I was right.
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.400]  I've been warning the people about this.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.140]  Here it is.
[00:37:58.901 --> 00:38:02.662]  President of the United States inviting Latino groups
[00:38:03.263 --> 00:38:04.404]  Principally Mexicans.
[00:38:05.164 --> 00:38:06.225]  Into the White House.
[00:38:07.006 --> 00:38:07.786]  Hundreds of them.
[00:38:08.947 --> 00:38:19.234]  Into the White House, as he gave a speech day before yesterday, that he was essentially seeking to legalize all of these illegal aliens.
[00:38:19.334 --> 00:38:28.500]  And then not only that, not only that, he said, we're going to reach out to the rest of the planet to match up willing employers with willing workers.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:32.903]  So the first is a general amnesty, and the second
[00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:34.132]  Yeah, it's gonna...
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:41.321]  And destroying the middle class.
[00:38:41.701 --> 00:38:41.962]  Yes.
[00:38:42.162 --> 00:38:45.605]  And again, they're saying they like the McCain bill.
[00:38:46.025 --> 00:38:47.146]  That's all in there.
[00:38:47.927 --> 00:38:52.190]  Bush, right before 9-11, had Fox at the White House saying, legalize all of them.
[00:38:52.791 --> 00:38:54.092]  This plan's even bolder.
[00:38:54.152 --> 00:38:54.932]  That's their answer.
[00:38:55.013 --> 00:38:56.374]  Oh, you don't like the illegals?
[00:38:56.414 --> 00:38:58.375]  Well, we'll just not make them illegal anymore.
[00:38:58.796 --> 00:39:04.721]  And now they're going to set up these databases where they're going to import the people even faster.
[00:39:07.362 --> 00:39:14.366]  And what we have been talking about, you and I have been talking about for years, is the Mexican conquest of the Southwest.
[00:39:15.406 --> 00:39:17.127]  The conquest of Aztlan.
[00:39:17.267 --> 00:39:18.508]  And their presidents say that.
[00:39:19.128 --> 00:39:20.249]  Now, yes.
[00:39:20.969 --> 00:39:27.712]  And if you don't believe it, here he is, here is the president of Mexico, saying just that.
[00:39:28.313 --> 00:39:35.076]  I proudly affirm that the Mexican nation extends beyond the territory
[00:39:44.649 --> 00:40:02.056]  That was then President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico, 1997, speaking in Chicago before the National Council of La Raza, saying, I have proudly affirmed that the Mexican nation extends beyond the territory enclosed by its borders
[00:40:02.705 --> 00:40:06.387]  And that Mexican migrants are an important, a very important part of it.
[00:40:06.427 --> 00:40:26.358]  Now Glenn, on top of this now, Mexico says they're going to send all their lobbyists in, to twist arms to do whatever to get Congress to do that, meddling in our internal affairs, firing lobbyists saying, get rid of your border, that is spies, that's KGB equivalent, but again it's hidden in plain view of foreign government.
[00:40:26.658 --> 00:40:29.160]  Fox, when he came to Austin, when I bullhorned him and
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:35.985]  Shut down his press conference and speech a few months ago, gave an award to the police department for not following the federal law.
[00:40:36.025 --> 00:40:43.910]  He said it, and gave an award to Wells Fargo, who is going to give them a national ID card that the banks and government are going to accept.
[00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:48.693]  Now we've got banks issuing them ID cards, not just their own consulates in our country.
[00:40:48.914 --> 00:40:54.958]  Imagine if you and I went down and tried to start a consulate in Mexico issuing Americans ID cards.
[00:40:54.978 --> 00:40:57.159]  There's no question about it.
[00:40:57.279 --> 00:40:58.000]  And not only that.
[00:40:58.991 --> 00:41:15.059]  But what we have to understand, you know, we've been talking about this, but I was amazed that just a few seconds ago that popped up on the Internet is an article out of the New York Times International out of Mexico City.
[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:23.884]  And the headline of this article in the New York Times says, of gringos and old grudges, this land is their land.
[00:41:24.744 --> 00:41:25.545]  And it goes in.
[00:41:26.149 --> 00:41:34.333]  It says, in the United States, almost no one remembers the war that Americans fought against Mexico more than 150 years ago.
[00:41:34.754 --> 00:41:38.035]  In Mexico, almost no one has forgotten.
[00:41:38.776 --> 00:41:44.439]  They're saying in this New York Times article that the Mexicans believe this is their land.
[00:41:44.519 --> 00:41:52.323]  Now, how crazy can it be that when the President of the United States brings in a group of people
[00:41:52.847 --> 00:41:56.249]  Who believe that the Southwest belongs to them.
[00:41:56.970 --> 00:42:02.273]  And a Zogby poll of a year and a half ago proved it beyond shadow of a doubt.
[00:42:02.393 --> 00:42:06.996]  Brings in a group of people who believe that part of the United States belongs to them.
[00:42:07.476 --> 00:42:09.638]  And essentially says, you got it!
[00:42:10.718 --> 00:42:13.861]  And it brings in people who are hostile to us.
[00:42:14.321 --> 00:42:16.202]  Who believe this is their territory.
[00:42:16.442 --> 00:42:17.743]  That we stole it from them.
[00:42:17.963 --> 00:42:20.565]  He brings these people into our midst!
[00:42:23.137 --> 00:42:32.309]  Now, Glenn, the neocons will say, OK, we don't like what Bush is doing, but it's just politics, leave him alone.
[00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:35.393]  They won't go as far as stating the facts.
[00:42:35.553 --> 00:42:36.395]  I live in Texas.
[00:42:37.376 --> 00:42:42.940]  And, you know, they got, you know, the signs up that say, race this, race that, Raza this, Raza that.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:46.963]  You know, on the side of a Mexican food restaurant, an Aztec cutting out a white guy's heart.
[00:42:46.983 --> 00:42:48.344]  You know, this is all real cute.
[00:42:48.384 --> 00:42:52.166]  How about I go paint, you know, a Nazi cutting a brown person's heart out?
[00:42:52.226 --> 00:42:53.007]  No, I wouldn't do that.
[00:42:53.047 --> 00:42:53.627]  That's bad.
[00:42:53.948 --> 00:42:55.669]  But again, this is acceptable.
[00:42:56.249 --> 00:43:15.124]  To break up the country, the globalists are doing it, Bush is doing it, in perpetuity, and again, if anybody, and you work with Native Americans, that's how you started out, if anybody owns this land, it's Native Americans, Mexico didn't have anybody up here, and why would the Mexicans want to make this Mexico where they live in total tyranny?
[00:43:16.085 --> 00:43:18.207]  They have absolutely no claim on this land.
[00:43:18.287 --> 00:43:21.129]  Texas had become part of the Union for nine years.
[00:43:21.149 --> 00:43:22.991]  That's why we fought the war of 1846 to 1848.
[00:43:26.446 --> 00:43:38.431]  California originally was settled by Native Americans, who were referred to in the Treaty of Guadalupe that settled the war with Mexico as savages.
[00:43:39.031 --> 00:43:41.092]  Mexicans never had any claim.
[00:43:41.132 --> 00:43:44.273]  The Aztecs were never in that part of the country.
[00:43:44.293 --> 00:43:46.494]  So that's all nonsense.
[00:43:46.574 --> 00:43:51.896]  Well, my point is, Glenn, if Mexico's so good, why do they all want to come up here?
[00:43:52.617 --> 00:43:57.079]  Well, the reason I'll tell you why they want to come up here is because their government is forcing them to come up here.
[00:43:57.619 --> 00:43:59.920]  Basically, what this is a fight over is this.
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:11.564]  Mexico is afraid that if they opened up their country to investment the way the United States is open to investment, that the gringos and others would eventually own everything.
[00:44:11.984 --> 00:44:13.165]  And they're probably right.
[00:44:14.062 --> 00:44:15.203]  So they don't want that.
[00:44:15.263 --> 00:44:17.044]  So they restrict investment.
[00:44:17.304 --> 00:44:29.570]  So what you've got is a tiny elite filling the peasants full of race consciousness, racism to control them, but the question is, why are the New York banks funding this Chicano Ku Klux Klan movement?
[00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:32.351]  But let me finish the little point that I wanted to make.
[00:44:33.152 --> 00:44:37.734]  So if Mexico were to be opened up to foreign investment, it would prosper.
[00:44:38.454 --> 00:44:39.955]  They have natural resources.
[00:44:40.475 --> 00:44:41.456]  They have oil.
[00:44:41.756 --> 00:44:43.477]  They have beautiful beaches.
[00:44:43.976 --> 00:44:53.838]  They have terrific natural resources, and if they were to be opened up to outside investment, they would prosper and they would not have illegal immigration.
[00:44:54.258 --> 00:44:59.159]  But by closing Mexico down to outside investment, they gain two things.
[00:44:59.579 --> 00:45:12.462]  These powerful families can run the country, plus they can send their people north, thereby occupying, reoccupying, or occupying the southwest.
[00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:16.753]  Thereby, instead of us taking over them, they take over us.
[00:45:16.773 --> 00:45:17.714]  That's the battle.
[00:45:17.874 --> 00:45:19.635]  That's the war we are still in.
[00:45:20.296 --> 00:45:21.837]  We're still in the Mexican War.
[00:45:21.877 --> 00:45:23.578]  We're still involved in it.
[00:45:23.798 --> 00:45:31.604]  But this time, instead of the American presidents and the people who lead this country fighting for our country, they are absolutely caving in and surrendering.
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:34.902]  And for those that don't understand what Glenn's saying, it's all documented.
[00:45:35.162 --> 00:45:39.545]  That's why they gave Mexicans dual citizenship, so they can vote on both sides.
[00:45:39.565 --> 00:45:45.829]  They can send their people over, make them citizens, take over already four South Texas towns.
[00:45:45.869 --> 00:45:47.170]  This is about a five-year-old story.
[00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:49.251]  San Antonio Express News, 10-part story.
[00:45:50.265 --> 00:45:55.447]  Fly the Mexican flag, you're not allowed to speak English in court proceedings, and nobody cares about that discrimination.
[00:45:55.687 --> 00:46:01.468]  You're going to have the same corrupt cops, the same system, the shakedowns, the Mordido, all of it.
[00:46:01.949 --> 00:46:02.489]  Absolutely.
[00:46:02.869 --> 00:46:07.590]  You know, 1994, 2004 is the 10 year anniversary of NAFTA.
[00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:13.592]  And in a survey, an analysis of the results of NAFTA, which we of course opposed,
[00:46:14.828 --> 00:46:15.608]  The World Bank!
[00:46:15.909 --> 00:46:16.670]  The World Bank!
[00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:21.815]  This is a middle-of-the-road, if not left-leaning organization.
[00:46:22.475 --> 00:46:27.600]  The reason that NAFTA hasn't worked in Mexico is because it's so corrupt!
[00:46:28.241 --> 00:46:31.424]  And this they say in public official documents.
[00:46:32.125 --> 00:46:33.606]  And Mexico is corrupt.
[00:46:33.826 --> 00:46:35.548]  It is a corrupt nation.
[00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:39.172]  And it's like a cancer spreading north.
[00:46:39.372 --> 00:46:43.434]  But Glenn, you didn't really answer my question, and you're the guy that's got the answers on this.
[00:46:44.195 --> 00:46:57.864]  Why do a lot of the Mexican people, I'm not talking about citizens here, they're more aware than anybody, why do they, if they know their government's oppressive, want to shut up Mexico here and have nowhere to run?
[00:46:58.064 --> 00:46:59.945]  Well, it's an interesting question.
[00:47:00.666 --> 00:47:05.949]  And the only answer that I could come to was addressed in Andres Oppenheimer's book,
[00:47:07.894 --> 00:47:09.195]  They're bordering on chaos.
[00:47:10.576 --> 00:47:12.898]  And that is, Mexico has never had immigration.
[00:47:13.698 --> 00:47:15.239]  They've never been a melting pot.
[00:47:15.259 --> 00:47:17.181]  They've never brought in new ideas.
[00:47:17.781 --> 00:47:24.246]  And the one thing that ties the Mexicans together, that makes the Mexicans, is a common history.
[00:47:24.906 --> 00:47:28.308]  And they say, once a Mexican, always a Mexican.
[00:47:28.989 --> 00:47:34.253]  And one of the aspects of that history that stands out like nothing else is the war with the United States.
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:50.967]  In essence, what they want to do is regain the glory of Mexico and regain the glory of their ancestors by reversing the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and making this the great and glorious Mexico that they think it should be.
[00:47:51.308 --> 00:47:55.950]  But Spain just came in as an empire, took over some Indians, claimed some land.
[00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:57.831]  France claimed parts of Texas.
[00:47:58.091 --> 00:48:00.092]  France isn't saying this belongs to them.
[00:48:00.512 --> 00:48:02.613]  Well, France ran Mexico for a while, you know.
[00:48:03.516 --> 00:48:07.258]  But the French Emirs ran Mexico for a while.
[00:48:07.298 --> 00:48:12.622]  You know, remember Cinco de Mayo was just a little skirmish.
[00:48:12.662 --> 00:48:17.625]  They ultimately lost that war and lost it to the French.
[00:48:17.885 --> 00:48:24.689]  Did you know that they allow Cinco de Mayo to be officially celebrated at UT but not the Texas Independence Day?
[00:48:24.749 --> 00:48:25.930]  It's evil, they didn't allow it.
[00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:26.890]  Absolutely.
[00:48:29.632 --> 00:48:31.313]  This is the kind of insanity
[00:48:32.174 --> 00:48:36.116]  That took over Nazi Germany, except in reverse.
[00:48:36.136 --> 00:48:42.899]  But if you want to destroy America, I mean, you know, it's a bunch of rich guys in New York and D.C.
[00:48:43.259 --> 00:48:44.259]  Why do they want to do this?
[00:48:44.279 --> 00:48:45.560]  To make us all serfs, I guess?
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.221]  Well, you know, it's sort of imperialism.
[00:48:48.261 --> 00:48:49.682]  People want to run the globe.
[00:48:49.722 --> 00:48:56.885]  There's a lot of different motivations which are aligned like the stars to turn us into this mess that we're in.
[00:48:57.443 --> 00:49:05.850]  But now that the debate is out in the open, now that the President has made this outrageous move, the media are forced to address it!
[00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:16.078]  Now, the stupid thing that Bush did was to open this wound only days before he's going to go to Mexico, reopen it, and put salt in it!
[00:49:17.078 --> 00:49:26.426]  So he's going to be in Mexico on Monday, and that's why, you know, basically, if I may say this, what Karl Rove has told the President, he's his political advisor, he says,
[00:49:27.319 --> 00:49:29.800]  All of the Democratic candidates are for amnesty.
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:30.600]  Full amnesty.
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:41.744]  So, you know, if you come out in favor of a so-called partial amnesty and help get the Hispanic vote, this is what Rove told him, the people have no place to go.
[00:49:41.764 --> 00:49:44.185]  You know, conservatives, what are they going to do?
[00:49:44.205 --> 00:49:45.165]  Vote for a Democrat?
[00:49:45.605 --> 00:49:47.566]  There is no third party candidate this time.
[00:49:47.606 --> 00:49:49.706]  They have no place to go.
[00:49:49.726 --> 00:49:51.487]  So you can do anything you want.
[00:49:52.426 --> 00:50:01.889]  So what, you know, the idea came forth that maybe since they're telling us we have no place to go, and when Bush goes to Mexico, we should go no place.
[00:50:01.909 --> 00:50:07.911]  And that is, on Monday the 12th, we and other people are asking Americans not to buy anything.
[00:50:08.411 --> 00:50:08.631]  Okay?
[00:50:08.671 --> 00:50:09.992]  This isn't a long boycott.
[00:50:10.112 --> 00:50:10.952]  It's just on Monday.
[00:50:11.372 --> 00:50:12.053]  Don't buy anything.
[00:50:12.093 --> 00:50:13.233]  Don't go to the store.
[00:50:13.914 --> 00:50:17.677]  Do your shopping on Sunday or Tuesday, but just don't buy anything.
[00:50:18.178 --> 00:50:20.960]  Don't go to the restaurant, don't go to the market, don't go to the movie.
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:24.143]  I want to add, too, that that's the spin the neocons are putting out.
[00:50:24.163 --> 00:50:25.324]  This is just political.
[00:50:25.444 --> 00:50:26.745]  I've looked at the plan, you've looked at it.
[00:50:26.805 --> 00:50:33.371]  As you said, total, complete, in perpetuity, amnesty, instantly, and bringing them in from other countries.
[00:50:34.152 --> 00:50:37.595]  This has totally demoralized the Border Patrol.
[00:50:39.051 --> 00:50:43.173]  Border Patrol people are saying, why do I even want to stop these people?
[00:50:43.193 --> 00:50:47.736]  Well, hey, making them pick up trash the last three years has done it.
[00:50:47.796 --> 00:50:57.701]  Why should I even go out to the border and risk my life, okay, out there with rattlesnakes and so forth, to stop these people when the President doesn't even want us to?
[00:50:57.781 --> 00:50:58.882]  Stay there, we'll be right back.
[00:51:01.084 --> 00:51:05.412]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.593 --> 00:51:09.961]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:12.762 --> 00:51:14.243]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.317 --> 00:51:41.862]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.062 --> 00:51:47.464]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:51:47.944 --> 00:51:50.606]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:51:50.686 --> 00:51:51.346]  Recall toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:51.366 --> 00:51:51.706]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:51.726 --> 00:51:53.027]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:03.852]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:52:03.912 --> 00:52:08.094]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:52:08.334 --> 00:52:11.115]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:52:11.316 --> 00:52:13.717]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:52:13.897 --> 00:52:22.561]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:52:22.741 --> 00:52:24.102]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:52:24.282 --> 00:52:28.404]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:52:28.404 --> 00:52:29.085]  We're good to go!
[00:52:48.142 --> 00:53:07.629]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:07.849 --> 00:53:10.110]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[00:53:16.992 --> 00:53:17.653]  We're good to go!
[00:53:46.511 --> 00:53:49.612]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:49.772 --> 00:53:55.713]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:00.854 --> 00:54:02.575]  This is the equivalent of a triter king.
[00:54:02.615 --> 00:54:04.235]  But again, Bush is just a puppet.
[00:54:13.465 --> 00:54:17.450]  Blasting holes in the wall and enemies pouring in, that's not enough.
[00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:23.398]  He runs down and opens the drawbridge and tells the people inside the city, stand down.
[00:54:24.139 --> 00:54:27.624]  The people running through screaming that they want our heads or our friends.
[00:54:28.479 --> 00:54:34.385]  Mexico says they're going to take over, says they're going to do all this, and they've got the big banks in New York pushing all this.
[00:54:34.945 --> 00:54:40.631]  Glenn Spencer, it's a great idea to not buy anything, to send a message on Monday, I will not do that, I'll be part of that big boycott.
[00:54:40.991 --> 00:54:42.913]  Everybody out there should remember this and do this.
[00:54:42.933 --> 00:54:45.476]  Yeah, just don't buy anything, just do it on Sunday and Monday.
[00:54:45.516 --> 00:54:47.718]  It's not going to hurt anybody, it's all it'll do.
[00:54:47.738 --> 00:54:50.060]  If we can get enough people to do it, just send a message.
[00:54:51.241 --> 00:54:53.063]  You know, people say, hey, wait a minute, where is everybody?
[00:54:53.849 --> 00:54:54.870]  It's not going to hurt anybody's pocketbook!
[00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:56.490]  It's not going to hurt anybody's pocketbook!
[00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:57.711]  It's not going to hurt anybody's pocketbook!
[00:54:57.731 --> 00:54:58.812]  It's not going to hurt anybody's pocketbook!
[00:54:58.832 --> 00:54:59.912]  It's not going to hurt anybody's pocketbook!
[00:54:59.952 --> 00:55:01.333]  It's not going to hurt anybody's pocketbook!
[00:55:01.353 --> 00:55:02.613]  It's not going to hurt anybody's pocketbook!
[00:55:02.633 --> 00:55:04.334]  It's not going to hurt anybody's pocketbook!
[00:55:04.354 --> 00:55:05.435]  It's not going to hurt anybody's pocketbook!
[00:55:06.115 --> 00:55:07.196]  It's not going to hurt anybody's pocketbook!
[00:55:07.216 --> 00:55:08.376]  It's not going to hurt anybody's pocketbook!
[00:55:08.396 --> 00:55:09.557]  It's not going to hurt anybody's pocketbook!
[00:55:09.577 --> 00:55:10.838]  It's not going to hurt anybody's pocketbook!
[00:55:10.858 --> 00:55:11.858]  It's not going to hurt anybody's pocketbook!
[00:55:11.878 --> 00:55:13.619]  It's not going to hurt anybody's pocketbook!
[00:55:13.639 --> 00:55:14.760]  It's not going to hurt anybody's pocketbook!
[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:15.760]  It's not going to hurt anybody's pocketbook!
[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:16.741]  It's not going to hurt anybody's pocketbook!
[00:55:16.761 --> 00:55:17.801]  It's not going to hurt anybody's pocketbook!
[00:55:17.821 --> 00:55:19.142]  It's not going to hurt anybody's pocketbook!
[00:55:19.162 --> 00:55:19.462]  It's not going
[00:55:19.949 --> 00:55:22.471]  Now, we've been embarrassing the people down here.
[00:55:22.491 --> 00:55:23.192]  What was it?
[00:55:23.252 --> 00:55:25.795]  Last Friday night, one of our sensors went off.
[00:55:25.835 --> 00:55:27.056]  We picked up ten people.
[00:55:27.096 --> 00:55:36.785]  We went out with our infrared camera and videotaped ten people, just what our ground sensor said, coming into the United States.
[00:55:36.825 --> 00:55:40.128]  They came within eight feet of our camera before they saw the little red light.
[00:55:40.508 --> 00:55:45.173]  You can go on AmericanBorderPatrol.com and see the streaming video and listen to the report.
[00:55:45.686 --> 00:55:47.067]  We're doing that more and more.
[00:55:47.447 --> 00:55:53.010]  We are a non-profit corporation, AmericanBorderPatrol.com, and you can go on and make a donation to it.
[00:55:53.551 --> 00:55:59.434]  We think we've shut down about three miles of the border because the Border Patrol doesn't want to be embarrassed.
[00:55:59.983 --> 00:56:04.645]  With more money, we'll make that 10 miles, and then 50 miles, and then 100 miles.
[00:56:04.745 --> 00:56:12.388]  Now, Glenn, that's a great idea, and you're doing a wonderful job, but look, if Bush gets his way, we're not even going to have a Border Patrol anymore.
[00:56:12.668 --> 00:56:23.712]  Well, he says we've got to have a Border Patrol, but what we have to show the American people is that it is a joke, it is a sham that people are flooding across.
[00:56:24.392 --> 00:56:26.913]  It's like Bill O'Reilly said last night, my gosh,
[00:56:27.401 --> 00:56:32.564]  If we do this and don't control the border in 10 years, we will not recognize this country.
[00:56:33.164 --> 00:56:34.165]  In 10 years!
[00:56:34.925 --> 00:56:36.746]  I mean, this is not a long time!
[00:56:37.307 --> 00:56:39.328]  This is back to 1994.
[00:56:39.608 --> 00:56:48.353]  Paul Craig Roberts, the famous author, with the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, went on the air the other day.
[00:56:48.393 --> 00:56:52.776]  I mean, he's one of the most highly respected economists on the planet!
[00:56:53.416 --> 00:56:56.518]  He said, in 20 years, America
[00:56:57.079 --> 00:56:59.441]  We'll be a third world country.
[00:57:00.201 --> 00:57:01.262]  I think sooner than that.
[00:57:01.302 --> 00:57:03.003]  I mean, we're going to be like Mexico.
[00:57:03.124 --> 00:57:05.665]  Our dollars are going to drop down to below the peso.
[00:57:07.307 --> 00:57:12.050]  You know, people forget that we've got about 9,000 nuclear weapons.
[00:57:12.751 --> 00:57:15.453]  If we're taken over by the third world, they're going to own them!
[00:57:18.695 --> 00:57:20.256]  It's absolutely incredible.
[00:57:20.336 --> 00:57:21.457]  They're really doing it.
[00:57:21.477 --> 00:57:23.339]  The globalists are killing America.
[00:57:23.359 --> 00:57:26.461]  They'll destroy the planet because if these people come in,
[00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:34.433]  And take over the political structure of this country, and get control of those nuclear weapons, the planet will be destroyed!
[00:57:37.135 --> 00:57:50.921]  Uh, Glenn, they've been shooting a lot of Border Patrol, killing a lot of people, the attacks, Ranch Rescue got shot at, it's getting bad, uh, you know, you talk about war in the streets, Ron Paul's talking about depression, uh, what do you see happening?
[00:57:52.061 --> 00:57:55.543]  Well, as I say, if we don't do anything,
[00:57:56.178 --> 00:57:59.980]  The third world will take over this country faster than we realize.
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:08.705]  They will come in, get the vote, put their people in, we will become destabilized, and the planet will be destroyed.
[00:58:09.345 --> 00:58:09.805]  Okay?
[00:58:09.845 --> 00:58:10.465]  Very quickly.
[00:58:11.146 --> 00:58:16.709]  Now, short of that, short of that, you know, the people have to put up resistance.
[00:58:16.729 --> 00:58:17.489]  They have to do it now.
[00:58:17.509 --> 00:58:18.530]  This is not a drill.
[00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:20.171]  This is the real thing.
[00:58:20.231 --> 00:58:22.812]  This is the real country of the United States at stake.
[00:58:23.948 --> 00:58:27.970]  And they don't only have to scream at their congressman, they have to run for office!
[00:58:28.311 --> 00:58:33.674]  They have to stand up and say, I'm going to run for Congress, and I'm going to be running on a platform of closing the border.
[00:58:33.874 --> 00:58:42.619]  I'm going to run for Chief of Police, and I'm going to run on the platform of... Alright, Glenn Spencer, thank you for your amazing work at AmericanPatrol.com.
[00:58:42.799 --> 00:58:43.079]  Alright.
[00:58:43.159 --> 00:58:45.200]  Hope folks visit it, hope to have you back on soon.
[00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:45.760]  Thanks a lot.
[00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:46.261]  You bet.
[00:58:46.281 --> 00:58:47.361]  We'll be back, folks.
[00:58:47.641 --> 00:58:48.942]  Shields are falling.
[00:58:49.182 --> 00:58:50.323]  Shields going down.
[00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:54.801]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:58:55.081 --> 00:58:58.583]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:58:58.663 --> 00:59:02.604]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:59:02.824 --> 00:59:09.006]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:59:09.406 --> 00:59:17.309]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:59:17.729 --> 00:59:23.071]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.
[00:59:23.231 --> 00:59:27.012]  Get the Black Berkey Filter Elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:59:27.352 --> 00:59:29.213]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.
[00:59:29.273 --> 00:59:31.434]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:59:31.694 --> 00:59:36.275]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91, or a 4-pack for only $173.
[00:59:36.315 --> 00:59:42.217]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:59:45.618 --> 00:59:49.440]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:59:57.485 --> 00:59:58.145]  Big Brother.
[00:59:58.785 --> 00:59:59.866]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:00.566 --> 01:00:01.727]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:01.747 --> 01:00:03.148]  You want answers?
[01:00:03.888 --> 01:00:04.829]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:04.849 --> 01:00:09.371]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.631 --> 01:00:13.714]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.822 --> 01:00:24.272]  American Patrol just joined us and he's read the McCain bill and what Bush is pushing and his analysis is exactly on line with mine.
[01:00:24.952 --> 01:00:36.085]  Blanket total amnesty for everyone here, anyone that ever gets here in perpetuity, and the federal government allowing corporations to pay to bring in their own labor forces
[01:00:37.003 --> 01:00:42.406]  Just, you know, no more of the special visas, just wide open, importing in the third world.
[01:00:42.926 --> 01:00:45.748]  Six plus billion people, all wanting to come here.
[01:00:46.088 --> 01:00:51.691]  They'll all come in, become citizens, pull the lever for gun control, pull the lever for tyranny.
[01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:53.452]  They're used to cops shoving them around.
[01:00:53.752 --> 01:00:54.853]  They're used to tyranny.
[01:00:56.254 --> 01:00:57.314]  This is the globalist plan.
[01:00:57.334 --> 01:00:58.795]  You're watching America die.
[01:00:59.075 --> 01:01:02.417]  You're watching the government lower the shields, lower the drawbridge,
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:09.807]  And let the barbarians in by design to destroy America, then you'll have your EU and your New World Order.
[01:01:11.229 --> 01:01:13.731]  And a lot of the neocons are making excuses for Bush.
[01:01:13.932 --> 01:01:15.293]  Oh, he's just being political.
[01:01:16.314 --> 01:01:20.258]  Folks, it's politically unpopular to do what he's doing in all the major polls.
[01:01:20.579 --> 01:01:22.621]  The majority of Hispanics are against this.
[01:01:23.062 --> 01:01:25.204]  They try to make it a racial issue, that is Bush does.
[01:01:25.905 --> 01:01:27.066]  There is so much news.
[01:01:27.106 --> 01:01:28.788]  We're joined by Joel Skousen.
[01:01:29.168 --> 01:01:35.013]  Joel Skousen is a political scientist by training, specializing in philosophy and law and constitutional theory.
[01:01:35.173 --> 01:01:38.396]  He's also the designer of high security residences and retreats.
[01:01:38.416 --> 01:01:44.342]  He's designed self-sufficient high security homes throughout North America and has consulted in Central America as well.
[01:01:45.226 --> 01:01:48.688]  And he's also a fighter pilot in Vietnam.
[01:01:49.328 --> 01:01:53.690]  And we're honored to have Joel Skousen on the show.
[01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:55.571]  The website's joelskousen.com.
[01:01:56.071 --> 01:02:00.353]  Talk about 9-11, the police state, the New World Order, the open borders, all of it.
[01:02:00.674 --> 01:02:01.714]  Joel, good to have you on.
[01:02:02.134 --> 01:02:02.795]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:02:02.895 --> 01:02:04.075]  It's always good to be with you.
[01:02:04.395 --> 01:02:06.997]  Let me get your take on the getting rid of the borders.
[01:02:07.857 --> 01:02:13.460]  Well, I just wrote my latest world affairs brief coming out today called Amnesty by Stealth.
[01:02:14.201 --> 01:02:17.542]  And it really isn't very stealthy, frankly, as you pointed out.
[01:02:18.982 --> 01:02:38.808]  This is a very interesting case in the sense that even pragmatic Karl Rove, Bush's chief political adviser, gave strong warning to Bush that this is a dead political issue unless you call it by some other name.
[01:02:39.568 --> 01:02:41.028]  And that's what went on in the White House.
[01:02:41.068 --> 01:02:41.389]  They said,
[01:02:44.583 --> 01:02:46.404]  Yeah, we won't call this amnesty.
[01:02:46.444 --> 01:02:49.587]  We'll just call it, you know, a temporary worker program.
[01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:52.909]  But it's amnesty, whatever name you want to call it.
[01:02:52.949 --> 01:02:55.050]  Well, it's the boldest amnesty ever seen.
[01:02:55.090 --> 01:02:58.913]  The way this is written, it's not just who's here, it's whoever gets here.
[01:02:59.834 --> 01:03:00.254]  Exactly.
[01:03:00.274 --> 01:03:01.535]  It's an ongoing program.
[01:03:02.255 --> 01:03:12.943]  For example, let me show you what... You know, he says, or at least the AP who commented and gave the government line said, this is supposed to tell the United States
[01:03:13.719 --> 01:03:15.620]  And get a handle on who's crossing the border.
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:18.581]  Well, it doesn't do anything at all, except for those that are illegal.
[01:03:18.641 --> 01:03:21.743]  Now, yes, they'll be on the rolls, and they can go pass freely.
[01:03:22.143 --> 01:03:34.208]  But when you have a huge magnet like this, you're going to have tons more coming across the border, because they know all they've got to do is get a job, run down to the local INS, sign up for the Temporary Worker Program, and they're in scot-free.
[01:03:34.748 --> 01:03:35.849]  And it's not temporary.
[01:03:35.909 --> 01:03:38.930]  After three years, they automatically reissue it.
[01:03:39.918 --> 01:03:42.600]  Yes, there's another aspect of that, too.
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:49.285]  Bush is attempting to at least double the number of green cards that are going to be allowed.
[01:03:49.305 --> 01:03:56.210]  They will be immediately eligible to apply for a green card as soon as they sign on to this temporary worker program.
[01:03:57.911 --> 01:04:00.753]  So this is a seamless amnesty.
[01:04:00.893 --> 01:04:02.634]  It's just a play on words.
[01:04:02.754 --> 01:04:05.136]  But, you know, this shouldn't surprise us, as you know.
[01:04:06.527 --> 01:04:14.213]  At least three months ago, Bush says he was going to push another amnesty, and it just got so much flack that he's had to rename it.
[01:04:14.253 --> 01:04:19.437]  In fact, he had the audacity to say when he announced this, this is not an amnesty.
[01:04:19.797 --> 01:04:26.062]  I mean, it's like the bigger the lie, the more effective it is, and conservatives are nodding their heads.
[01:04:26.263 --> 01:04:28.945]  Yeah, Joel, Joel, this is not a radio show.
[01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:33.849]  This is not a radio show, and you're not Joel Skelton, and I'm not Alex Jones, okay?
[01:04:35.157 --> 01:04:36.759]  Hey, what are you, a conspiracy theorist?
[01:04:36.779 --> 01:04:38.381]  Your name's not Joel, okay?
[01:04:39.683 --> 01:04:41.425]  All right, we'll be back.
[01:04:41.445 --> 01:04:44.008]  We'll get into 9-11 and a lot more.
[01:04:44.889 --> 01:04:45.810]  There's so much happening.
[01:04:45.830 --> 01:04:49.274]  I want to get your take, too, on this new moon mission and Mars mission.
[01:04:49.755 --> 01:04:51.177]  We'll be back, and we'll take your calls.
[01:04:53.155 --> 01:04:56.658]  I have been on Collagenate for three months now, and I've lost 40 pounds.
[01:04:57.158 --> 01:04:58.599]  40 pounds in three months?
[01:04:59.099 --> 01:05:04.643]  Ann's another listener who took my advice and lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:05:04.903 --> 01:05:07.125]  I heard about Collagenate through a radio station.
[01:05:07.485 --> 01:05:09.527]  I've gone down about three dress sizes.
[01:05:09.727 --> 01:05:10.227]  I feel good.
[01:05:10.247 --> 01:05:10.868]  I have energy.
[01:05:10.888 --> 01:05:12.109]  I was really tired before.
[01:05:12.149 --> 01:05:15.071]  I didn't have a lot of energy, and I've got three kids, so it was kind of hard to keep up with them.
[01:05:15.211 --> 01:05:16.272]  But now I feel wonderful.
[01:05:16.452 --> 01:05:17.853]  I've had people notice quite a bit.
[01:05:17.893 --> 01:05:19.634]  They're coming up to me and they're saying, what have you done?
[01:05:19.694 --> 01:05:20.975]  And just knowing I went on Collagenate.
[01:05:21.514 --> 01:05:25.017]  I have been on Collagenate for three months now, and I've lost 40 pounds.
[01:05:25.277 --> 01:05:26.257]  Wow!
[01:05:26.277 --> 01:05:26.878]  40 pounds!
[01:05:27.278 --> 01:05:31.081]  This was Anne's personal experience while taking VeminVigor's Collagenate.
[01:05:31.281 --> 01:05:33.583]  Why don't you see what Collagenate can do for you?
[01:05:33.883 --> 01:05:35.344]  Call VeminVigor today at 1-800-622-THIN.
[01:05:35.364 --> 01:05:35.624]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[01:05:35.644 --> 01:05:36.945]  And hey, get $25 off a three-month supply of Collagenate.
[01:05:37.005 --> 01:05:37.746]  You've got to call now, 1-800-622-8446.
[01:05:37.766 --> 01:05:38.246]  Again, that's 1-800-622-THIN.
[01:05:51.235 --> 01:05:57.698]  Then... Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:05:58.038 --> 01:06:02.140]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:06:02.421 --> 01:06:02.981]  We listened.
[01:06:03.281 --> 01:06:08.263]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:06:08.544 --> 01:06:09.024]  We listened.
[01:06:09.404 --> 01:06:12.445]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:06:12.866 --> 01:06:13.386]  We listened.
[01:06:13.866 --> 01:06:17.928]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:18.788]  We listened.
[01:06:19.128 --> 01:06:24.371]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:06:24.791 --> 01:06:26.151]  Again, we listened.
[01:06:26.512 --> 01:06:33.895]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:06:34.275 --> 01:06:37.736]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[01:06:43.769 --> 01:06:47.394]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[01:06:48.255 --> 01:06:49.677]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:55.906]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:06:56.106 --> 01:07:00.472]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:07:03.490 --> 01:07:05.170]  You will lose your liberty
[01:07:21.795 --> 01:07:32.358]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:07:32.558 --> 01:07:37.919]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:07:38.439 --> 01:07:41.820]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:42.200]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:43.500]  Order today and spread the word!
[01:07:57.634 --> 01:07:58.254]  Big Brother.
[01:07:58.935 --> 01:07:59.995]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:00.696 --> 01:08:01.797]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:02.457 --> 01:08:03.277]  You want answers?
[01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:04.958]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:05.599 --> 01:08:09.341]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.781 --> 01:08:13.904]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:14.985 --> 01:08:20.308]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, already eight minutes and roughly 30 seconds into the second hour.
[01:08:22.958 --> 01:08:28.224]  We're joined by Joel Skousen, a political scientist, expert in law and constitutional theory.
[01:08:28.705 --> 01:08:31.989]  Joel was raised in Oregon and later served as a fighter pilot for the U.S.
[01:08:32.029 --> 01:08:40.699]  Marine Corps during the Vietnam era, prior to beginning his design firm specializing in high security residences and retreats during the 80s.
[01:08:42.046 --> 01:08:46.690]  He took a leave of absence to serve as the Chairman of the Conservative National Committee in Washington, D.C.
[01:08:47.271 --> 01:08:50.794]  and can currently serve as the Executive Director of Conservative Digest.
[01:08:50.814 --> 01:08:59.721]  For two years, he published a newsletter entitled, The World Affairs Brief, and served as a Senior Editor of Cogitations, a quarterly journal on law and government.
[01:09:00.102 --> 01:09:06.487]  The World Affairs Brief is now back in publication and is available as a weekly email newsletter or as a monthly print edition.
[01:09:06.868 --> 01:09:08.729]  The website is joelskalsen.com.
[01:09:09.930 --> 01:09:12.033]  And we'll spell that out for you a little bit later.
[01:09:12.273 --> 01:09:14.916]  We've got a link to it on InfoWars.com.
[01:09:16.237 --> 01:09:20.061]  Joel, we were talking about the border and talking about the end of America.
[01:09:20.602 --> 01:09:22.203]  Why would the globalists want to do this?
[01:09:22.363 --> 01:09:25.967]  But for those that just joined us, first off, what is the New World Order?
[01:09:26.288 --> 01:09:27.409]  What is globalism?
[01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:31.393]  And what will life be like once we get deeper into it?
[01:09:32.901 --> 01:09:34.982]  Well, that's a big package of questions there.
[01:09:35.143 --> 01:09:36.964]  Which do you want me to take first, Alex?
[01:09:37.004 --> 01:09:37.844]  Take all three of them.
[01:09:37.864 --> 01:09:40.166]  They're all interconnected.
[01:09:40.226 --> 01:09:50.473]  Well, let's finish up the border issue before we go into the broader New World Order issues, because I think this is very crucial for people to understand the tactics that they're going to use.
[01:09:51.673 --> 01:10:01.820]  You know, there's been a lot of hoopla about Homeland Security and Bush saying he's going to protect us, but there has been virtually no proposal whatsoever from this administration
[01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:03.351]  To close this border.
[01:10:03.971 --> 01:10:06.333]  Now, they don't intend to, in my opinion.
[01:10:06.474 --> 01:10:10.317]  What they do intend to do is continue to play the game of rhetoric.
[01:10:10.837 --> 01:10:13.900]  Conservatives are particularly susceptible to this concept.
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:19.544]  Give them a little bit of a promise, and they'll give you another three years until they finally start to say, hey, he never fulfilled that.
[01:10:19.564 --> 01:10:20.565]  Let's press him again.
[01:10:20.585 --> 01:10:22.106]  Then they give him another promise.
[01:10:22.166 --> 01:10:27.591]  And pretty soon, eight or ten more years have passed with open borders, and all of a sudden,
[01:10:28.385 --> 01:10:35.468]  And I'm predicting this, that within 10 years, our Mexican-American, you know, will be such a large percentage.
[01:10:35.508 --> 01:10:48.952]  They may not be a majority yet of this country, but virtually it will become impossible for any politician to get elected without kowtowing to that Latino minority, big minority.
[01:10:48.992 --> 01:10:51.193]  They're already, of course, the biggest minority in the country.
[01:10:51.213 --> 01:10:55.995]  And I think that's what the strategy is, is you want to continue to placate
[01:10:56.644 --> 01:11:01.567]  Harass, discuss, ad infinitum, until it's too late.
[01:11:02.087 --> 01:11:06.530]  And I think Americans really need to draw a line on this proposal.
[01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:07.510]  I know it's slick.
[01:11:08.091 --> 01:11:14.394]  It's difficult to convince conservatives that this is really a ruse, because he says all the right words.
[01:11:15.035 --> 01:11:21.779]  But believe me, if we don't quickly stop this, I don't think, you know, California may not even have a chance.
[01:11:21.819 --> 01:11:26.041]  They've resurrected Proposition 187 to try to cut off benefits, although they've
[01:11:26.770 --> 01:11:28.951]  Stop trying to cut off the public school benefits.
[01:11:29.011 --> 01:11:30.671]  That's a sacred cow now.
[01:11:31.232 --> 01:11:42.916]  But I think within three or four more years, even California won't be able to pass an anti-immigration law of any sort, just because of the massive amount of influx of people.
[01:11:42.996 --> 01:11:44.736]  I brought this question up to Glenn Spencer.
[01:11:47.873 --> 01:11:54.123]  I mean, in the polls, the majority of Hispanics are against open borders, but the media frames it like it's something Hispanics want.
[01:11:54.583 --> 01:11:55.665]  Oh, this is a good thing.
[01:11:56.085 --> 01:11:57.568]  Of course, we always talk about Hispanics.
[01:11:57.608 --> 01:12:00.292]  That's the majority of the illegals pouring in from Latin America.
[01:12:00.813 --> 01:12:02.896]  Bush's deal will bring them in from all over the planet.
[01:12:02.916 --> 01:12:03.577]  It doesn't matter.
[01:12:04.612 --> 01:12:10.018]  How can somebody from Mexico want to make this like Mexico when they're trying to leave Mexico?
[01:12:10.278 --> 01:12:18.126]  I mean, I guess it's just a pride issue of, well, maybe I'll be rich once we enslave these people.
[01:12:18.166 --> 01:12:21.970]  Maybe that's the idea, kind of replicating that.
[01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:26.575]  Maybe they can be the big bosses over slaves like they've done in Mexico.
[01:12:27.145 --> 01:12:48.562]  Well, you know, I really don't think, you know, I'm fluent in Spanish, I know a lot of Mexican people, a lot of friends who have come across and become very good people here, and even fairly conservative, those that make some money become conservative, although they're hooked into the Republican image of conservatism, where it isn't truly protective of liberty anymore.
[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:51.802]  They really don't have a predatory instinct.
[01:12:51.862 --> 01:13:08.876]  There are groups that do, of course, and you've talked about them, Spencer's talked about that, but these are mostly, I think, front groups for the globalist agenda, or there are some that are still working with the latent Marxist movement that's still under the
[01:13:09.898 --> 01:13:13.340]  I think so, and clearly it's something that's very, very big in the mind of globalist Mexican President Vicente Fox.
[01:13:37.034 --> 01:13:43.739]  He is really a globalist, I think, that was put in collusion with the Bush administration.
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:53.507]  They have a regular roundtable where they discuss strategy about how to get through these pro-Mexican pieces of legislation across the American people.
[01:13:53.567 --> 01:14:03.775]  And what they, and I'm embarrassed to say, living in Utah now, that they have a real yes-man congressional delegation, I mean, super patriotic,
[01:14:05.071 --> 01:14:14.376]  Pro-Republican delegation here in Utah that literally is used to carry water for this administration on every one of these pro-Mexican initiatives.
[01:14:14.456 --> 01:14:17.837]  Well, Hatch wants Arnold to be able to be president, he said.
[01:14:17.857 --> 01:14:21.339]  They want to be able to have a foreigner, foreign-born, be the president.
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:32.465]  Yeah, you know, when this first came out, and I thought Hatch, and I know Senator Hatch, and whenever I talk to him, he says, oh, I'm just so busy, I just can't take any more projects on.
[01:14:33.041 --> 01:14:40.507]  I keep trying to get him to do what's right as a long-term friend of the family, but he's clearly sold out to the other side.
[01:14:41.288 --> 01:14:47.093]  You know, when he brought up this constitutional amendment about changing, I said, you know, there isn't any constituency for this.
[01:14:47.153 --> 01:14:48.033]  Where do you get this?
[01:14:48.054 --> 01:14:51.276]  You know, and of course, the administration wants it.
[01:14:51.336 --> 01:14:52.337]  He's just carrying water.
[01:14:52.437 --> 01:14:57.902]  This man has been promised, I believe, a seat on the Supreme Court if he continues to
[01:15:00.984 --> 01:15:06.245]  I don't know if they'll betray him like they did over the promise to run for president.
[01:15:07.145 --> 01:15:09.326]  They let him run against George Bush, he didn't have a chance.
[01:15:09.386 --> 01:15:16.828]  It was just a joke here in Utah to see Orrin Hatch going through the motions of trying to get the powers that be to fulfill his promise to him.
[01:15:17.850 --> 01:15:20.172]  He still is faithful to them.
[01:15:20.212 --> 01:15:21.192]  It's a real shame.
[01:15:21.493 --> 01:15:22.113]  Absolutely.
[01:15:22.133 --> 01:15:32.461]  Now, for those that just joined us, I don't want to get into 9-11 and fighter pilots' view on this and some of the evidence of what you think is coming up with new terror attacks, but for those that just joined us, what is the New World Order?
[01:15:33.522 --> 01:15:46.311]  Well, the New World Order is, to be very, very frank, it is a globalist conspiracy to take down national sovereignty at any nation who wants to defend it.
[01:15:46.812 --> 01:15:51.353]  Put all nations into a member state category.
[01:15:51.393 --> 01:15:59.555]  They'll still be given the token title of sovereign states, but they won't be sovereign any more than states are sovereign in the federal framework of the United States Constitution.
[01:16:01.596 --> 01:16:12.619]  And the process of the New World Order is, in fact, one of attempting to slowly talk people into losing their sovereignty.
[01:16:13.659 --> 01:16:15.780]  And eventually, if that doesn't work, to create
[01:16:17.165 --> 01:16:20.646]  A future world war that will force people into it.
[01:16:21.606 --> 01:16:24.607]  And I think that's what we're headed for sometime toward the end of this decade.
[01:16:25.868 --> 01:16:26.528]  I agree with you.
[01:16:26.628 --> 01:16:28.688]  Ron Paul says we're going to have a depression.
[01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:32.630]  Bush passed much of Patriot Act 3 a few weeks ago.
[01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:34.910]  Patriot Act 2 a few weeks ago.
[01:16:36.031 --> 01:16:39.912]  And now there's discussions of the Victory Act 2, which is really Patriot Act 3.
[01:16:41.269 --> 01:16:51.599]  I mean, Joel, I listened to a bunch of neocon talk radio yesterday, and it was, well, Bush, this is kind of bad, but he can't help it, and well, you wouldn't rather have the Democrats, would you?
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:57.344]  Well, yeah, I mean, under Bill Clinton, he couldn't get away with this, because conservatives were awake and aware!
[01:16:57.805 --> 01:17:06.053]  George Bush, bigger government, open borders, says he'll sign the assault weapons ban, campaign finance reform, protecting Bill Clinton, signing on to UNESCO.
[01:17:06.973 --> 01:17:08.735]  I mean, you talk about water bears.
[01:17:08.835 --> 01:17:11.717]  I mean, you know, what do you have to say about all these Rush Limbaughs?
[01:17:12.157 --> 01:17:23.725]  You know, what's really interesting about the comments I get from conservatives in response to my newsletter each week is that, well, you know, Bush is anti-UN.
[01:17:23.865 --> 01:17:26.867]  You know, he's really done us a great service, and it's not true at all.
[01:17:27.468 --> 01:17:30.189]  You know, it's a very sophisticated game Bush is playing.
[01:17:32.445 --> 01:17:38.830]  It's a very sophisticated strategy, and it's very difficult for many people to understand it, but let me see if I can't explain it.
[01:17:39.931 --> 01:17:42.914]  Essentially, Bush has to do two things simultaneously.
[01:17:43.595 --> 01:17:58.928]  He has to, first of all, antagonize the world against the United States in order to someday force people to switch their allegiance to the United States defending democracy, quote, to the New World Order defending, and that's what's happening.
[01:17:59.349 --> 01:18:07.820]  For example, by taking this unilateral approach to foreign policy, the Bush administration is engendering a great deal of hate and discontent against the U.S.
[01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:14.909]  Now, this will eventually be used by Russia and China to justify their striking America with a preemptive nuclear strike.
[01:18:15.413 --> 01:18:21.196]  At some point, when they have to say, hey, somebody's got to stop this rogue nation rampaging to the world.
[01:18:21.456 --> 01:18:23.037]  Then the world will see it as good.
[01:18:23.057 --> 01:18:25.739]  They're playing the bad cop in Iraq.
[01:18:26.019 --> 01:18:26.599]  Then the U.N.
[01:18:26.639 --> 01:18:28.701]  comes in as the good cop, and here's the Washington Post.
[01:18:28.941 --> 01:18:29.901]  White House wants the U.N.
[01:18:29.921 --> 01:18:30.962]  to return to Iraq.
[01:18:31.322 --> 01:18:32.263]  That's today.
[01:18:32.783 --> 01:18:33.383]  Here's another one.
[01:18:33.523 --> 01:18:33.883]  U.N.
[01:18:33.943 --> 01:18:37.706]  and Guatemala sign landmark agreement and bid to curb illegal and secret groups.
[01:18:37.986 --> 01:18:38.426]  The U.N.
[01:18:38.486 --> 01:18:40.987]  is taking over the police forces of Guatemala.
[01:18:41.027 --> 01:18:41.488]  Go ahead.
[01:18:42.388 --> 01:18:43.169]  But it's true that
[01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:51.072]  The UN has been raised in the eyes of moderates and even liberal people because it's viewed as the only hope.
[01:18:51.775 --> 01:18:54.196]  To put the Bush administration in their place, the U.S.
[01:18:54.236 --> 01:18:59.758]  has looked upon as benevolent in Iraq, and it never has had a benevolent president in any country.
[01:18:59.879 --> 01:19:05.061]  Well, Joe, the same thing, exactly, we'll talk about it when we get back, but the same thing with England.
[01:19:05.081 --> 01:19:11.724]  They'll pass draconian laws, abuse the people, then the only recourse is the EU, and they'll actually give them good rulings.
[01:19:12.084 --> 01:19:15.445]  Now the British people are starting to see the EU as the good guys.
[01:19:15.885 --> 01:19:16.286]  That's right.
[01:19:16.326 --> 01:19:17.206]  It's very, very slick.
[01:19:18.041 --> 01:19:25.703]  Now, one thing I might also point out, and I'm probably the only one who's analyzed this this way, is there is a split within the New World Order.
[01:19:25.723 --> 01:19:27.164]  Maybe we can talk about that after the break.
[01:19:27.184 --> 01:19:27.964]  Sure, we will, Joel.
[01:19:27.984 --> 01:19:28.764]  We're honored to have you.
[01:19:28.804 --> 01:19:30.665]  A real expert on the New World Order, folks.
[01:19:31.365 --> 01:19:33.365]  Enjoy talking to someone I know who they're talking about.
[01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:35.566]  And this is the reality.
[01:19:35.606 --> 01:19:38.607]  What you're hearing, they're planning to destroy you and your family!
[01:19:39.087 --> 01:19:45.309]  They want you enslaved to mindless surf, hopped up on Prozac, living in some high-rise cubicle.
[01:19:45.968 --> 01:19:48.095]  Biometrically scanning the buy and sell.
[01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:49.680]  Do you want to be part of that?
[01:19:49.801 --> 01:19:51.948]  It's only a few years away.
[01:19:53.027 --> 01:19:57.751]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[01:19:57.971 --> 01:20:01.414]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[01:20:01.634 --> 01:20:04.096]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[01:20:04.337 --> 01:20:12.944]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[01:20:13.304 --> 01:20:19.069]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[01:20:19.349 --> 01:20:21.290]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[01:20:21.530 --> 01:20:28.473]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.
[01:20:28.813 --> 01:20:35.275]  Midas Resources is pleased to offer a subscription to the International Forecaster newsletter free of charge with a qualifying order.
[01:20:35.535 --> 01:20:42.858]  That's right, for a limited time, Midas Resources is offering a one-year subscription to Bob Chapman's powerful newsletter, the International Forecaster.
[01:20:43.118 --> 01:20:47.562]  Call 800-686-2237 for more information or to place your order.
[01:20:47.662 --> 01:20:48.082]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:48.123 --> 01:20:52.466]  Call today and avoid getting soaked tomorrow.
[01:20:53.047 --> 01:20:55.989]  Americans, get the IRS off your back legally.
[01:20:56.150 --> 01:20:59.112]  Discover the secret the IRS is terrified you'll learn.
[01:20:59.352 --> 01:21:02.635]  You probably owe no federal income tax and never have.
[01:21:02.996 --> 01:21:08.020]  The IRS itself admits that millions and millions of Americans already have learned the truth and have
[01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:08.700]  I don't think so.
[01:21:30.297 --> 01:21:32.059]  I know this sounds crazy and scary.
[01:21:32.139 --> 01:21:35.222]  You've been carefully trained by government propaganda for decades.
[01:21:35.402 --> 01:21:44.390]  But especially today with a tough economy, why would you let the government continue to illegally grab money from you when there's a simple, proven, and legal way to keep it all yourself?
[01:21:44.710 --> 01:21:49.474]  To get the details and learn the truth, get on the internet and go to federaltax.net.
[01:21:49.614 --> 01:21:51.556]  That's federaltax.net.
[01:21:51.696 --> 01:21:52.297]  Do it today.
[01:21:52.937 --> 01:21:58.180]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:06.404]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:22:06.664 --> 01:22:13.708]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:22:13.908 --> 01:22:15.168]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[01:22:15.248 --> 01:22:21.150]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:22:21.330 --> 01:22:26.431]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:22:26.531 --> 01:22:35.414]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:22:35.674 --> 01:22:42.556]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at

[01:22:47.747 --> 01:22:48.068]  That's 888-803-4438.

[01:23:07.162 --> 01:23:12.324]  Imagine green beans, carrots, peas, and cucumbers, tomatoes, cabbage, squash, herbs, and more.
[01:23:12.524 --> 01:23:16.546]  Then, harvest your seeds to grow year after year for old-time self-reliance.
[01:23:16.846 --> 01:23:20.528]  In Living Well on Wheat, learn how to cook, eat, and survive on the golden grain.
[01:23:20.848 --> 01:23:23.830]  Preserve your good food for years with the USDA Canning Guide.
[01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:30.133]  In surviving a bioterrorist attack, you'll learn how to protect yourself and your family now from the attacks our government says are coming.
[01:23:30.213 --> 01:23:31.273]  Not if, but when.
[01:23:31.513 --> 01:23:38.016]  Normally selling for $140 plus shipping, get this whole package now for only $69 and shipping is free.

[01:23:48.502 --> 01:23:48.742]  P.O.
[01:23:48.782 --> 01:23:51.023]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[01:23:59.768 --> 01:24:04.570]  Coming up in the next segment, we'll take your calls from Joe Skousen, the toll-free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[01:24:04.590 --> 01:24:04.650]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:24:12.631 --> 01:24:14.773]  His website is joelskousen.com.
[01:24:14.813 --> 01:24:16.374]  That's Joel, and then Skousen.
[01:24:16.874 --> 01:24:19.356]  S-K-O-U-S-E-N dot com.
[01:24:21.398 --> 01:24:23.699]  Joel, you were talking about a split in the New World Order.
[01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:31.545]  I'd imagine there's thousands of low-level splits with these criminals always fighting with each other, like different mafias do.
[01:24:31.585 --> 01:24:35.609]  They just agree to keep the general public in the dark, but have wars with each other.
[01:24:35.629 --> 01:24:38.090]  But you're talking about two major blocks.
[01:24:38.170 --> 01:24:38.631]  Go ahead.
[01:24:39.554 --> 01:24:39.914]  I am.
[01:24:40.155 --> 01:24:44.097]  Before I answer that, let me just say I need to talk to you off air during the next break.
[01:24:44.477 --> 01:24:45.318]  Sure.
[01:24:46.219 --> 01:24:54.384]  There is, in my analysis, two major controlling powers that are attempting to take control of the New World Order.
[01:24:55.445 --> 01:25:06.032]  One is the Anglo-American establishment, you know, that we're most familiar with, that we view traditionally as the New World Order, and they're the ones essentially in the driver's seat right now because they control the purse strings.
[01:25:06.621 --> 01:25:16.345]  They control the World Bank, they control the Bank of International Settlements, most of the central banks, if not all of them, and so they're really in the driver's seat.
[01:25:16.465 --> 01:25:27.389]  But there is another faction, and that is a Moscow-driven faction, which controls most of the European-based New World Order structure, including the EU.
[01:25:28.389 --> 01:25:29.769]  Now you say, well, how could that be?
[01:25:29.789 --> 01:25:33.391]  You know, these people are in NATO, they're anti-communist.
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:35.481]  That's more on the surface.
[01:25:35.641 --> 01:25:45.467]  In fact, once World War II ended, the Communist Party decided to go underground and run all of their operations through the Socialist International.
[01:25:45.527 --> 01:25:47.229]  And that puts a different light on the subject.
[01:25:47.289 --> 01:25:58.416]  If you look at the membership of the Socialist International, you will find that almost all leaders in Europe, major European nations, are members of the Socialist International.
[01:25:59.108 --> 01:26:01.989]  And it breaches across into Latin America as well.
[01:26:02.810 --> 01:26:09.853]  All of the presidents under the PRI that used to run Mexico until Vicente Fox were part of the Socialist International.
[01:26:09.873 --> 01:26:13.994]  In other words, they were essentially under the control of Moscow.
[01:26:14.635 --> 01:26:21.978]  So, what we have now is Vicente Fox got the other side of the New World Order, got its hand into Mexico through him.
[01:26:23.337 --> 01:26:24.998]  Tony Blair's an interesting case.
[01:26:25.018 --> 01:26:32.680]  I'm trying to analyze for your listeners which side of the New World Order faction are these leaders on.
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:52.986]  Tony Blair is actually part of the Socialist International Moscow Marxist faction, but he is playing as a big ally of George Bush, and I think it's a little bit of a Trojan horse, the Moscow side trying to make inroads into the power structure of the Anglo-American establishment.
[01:26:53.652 --> 01:27:00.177]  But you see, the Moscow side of the New World Order controls the U.N.
[01:27:00.217 --> 01:27:01.138]  Security Council.
[01:27:01.218 --> 01:27:01.739]  The U.S.
[01:27:02.199 --> 01:27:05.161]  controls that, but it controls the General Assembly.
[01:27:05.462 --> 01:27:08.884]  About 90% of the nations vote right down the Moscow party line.
[01:27:10.646 --> 01:27:12.307]  So that's why the U.N.
[01:27:12.647 --> 01:27:16.851]  continues to try to chip away at Security Council powers.
[01:27:17.648 --> 01:27:18.868]  And that's very, very dangerous.
[01:27:18.928 --> 01:27:28.490]  Right now, you know, western states have a, everybody's got a veto power, and even though the communists have a veto power, it does allow us to maintain some sovereignty.
[01:27:28.710 --> 01:27:36.632]  But earlier, Joel, you said Bush, and this is clearly what's happening, is playing into this, building the UN up, actually legitimizing them.
[01:27:37.372 --> 01:27:44.374]  Precisely, and that's why you don't find, despite their controversy, the so-called controversy with the UN, you never find the US
[01:27:44.958 --> 01:27:46.779]  Attempting to get out of the U.N.
[01:27:46.859 --> 01:27:49.100]  or strengthen their position of sovereignty.
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:51.901]  And they never used their veto, hardly at all.
[01:27:51.921 --> 01:27:54.202]  See, Joel, you see this as two separate systems.
[01:27:54.642 --> 01:27:56.563]  I see it as a left and right arm.
[01:27:57.063 --> 01:28:07.387]  At the top of that pyramid, you've got the big central banks that need two sides to keep their criminal arms in line so one of the arms doesn't try to get ascension on its own.
[01:28:07.667 --> 01:28:08.848]  But there's a difference.
[01:28:08.908 --> 01:28:11.369]  There's still a difference, even though I agree that
[01:28:12.358 --> 01:28:20.220]  Your big central banks still continue to prop up Russia, they continue to help maintain this grand deception of the fall of the Soviet Union.
[01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:34.883]  Nevertheless, I differ from the General Birx's side of view that, in fact my uncle began and promulgated this about the Anglo-American deception of controlling both sides of the political spectrum, including the communists, but it really isn't true.
[01:28:35.359 --> 01:28:36.320]  They influence it.
[01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:38.801]  They build it up for Hegelian purposes.
[01:28:38.821 --> 01:28:39.921]  Well, that's what I just said.
[01:28:39.961 --> 01:28:40.642]  Exactly.
[01:28:40.782 --> 01:28:42.122]  I don't think it's a left and right arm.
[01:28:42.202 --> 01:28:45.244]  I think the Russians are actually a separate predatory power.
[01:28:45.842 --> 01:28:48.923]  And they intend to kill the West at some point.
[01:28:49.263 --> 01:28:50.064]  Not to destroy it.
[01:28:50.084 --> 01:28:56.286]  What I'm saying is the bankers need to have that threat to keep the Anglo-American establishment in line.
[01:28:56.486 --> 01:28:59.007]  The top of the pyramid plays the two sides against each other.
[01:28:59.107 --> 01:29:01.108]  Yes, but it's not a direct control.
[01:29:01.168 --> 01:29:02.148]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:29:02.208 --> 01:29:04.149]  No, I think they've lost control in many cases.
[01:29:04.589 --> 01:29:12.752]  It's still in direct control, and they are inducing the Russians to someday strike, and the Russians are having... They're reluctant to.
[01:29:12.792 --> 01:29:15.153]  They suspect a trap, and there is a trap being set.
[01:29:15.948 --> 01:29:21.732]  Alright, when we get back, I want to briefly talk about, as a fighter pilot, what you were saying about September 11th.
[01:29:21.752 --> 01:29:24.834]  That's very important, and get your response on that, and then we'll go to some calls.
[01:29:25.394 --> 01:29:39.404]  We'll be right back, folks, and then we've got Heath Parker coming on from Texas Frontline to talk about the immigration situation, the end of the border, the capitulation of the globalists by Lord Bush, and then we'll also get to Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:29:40.265 --> 01:29:41.666]  Well, yeah, a lot of guests today.
[01:29:41.706 --> 01:29:42.126]  Stay with us.
[01:29:43.391 --> 01:29:46.392]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:46.412 --> 01:29:50.073]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:07.037 --> 01:30:08.457]  Well, the same is true for your mind.

[01:30:54.016 --> 01:30:56.238]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:30:56.658 --> 01:31:01.001]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:31:01.302 --> 01:31:07.106]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:31:07.326 --> 01:31:11.389]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:17.314]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[01:31:17.434 --> 01:31:20.056]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:31:22.137 --> 01:31:25.659]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 now.
[01:31:25.779 --> 01:31:28.461]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[01:31:28.801 --> 01:31:31.102]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[01:31:31.483 --> 01:31:35.105]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[01:31:35.585 --> 01:31:41.789]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:43.190]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:31:43.210 --> 01:31:43.990]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:31:44.030 --> 01:31:44.270]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:31:54.801 --> 01:32:00.285]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:32:00.725 --> 01:32:04.948]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:32:05.188 --> 01:32:12.213]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:32:12.594 --> 01:32:18.698]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:32:18.718 --> 01:32:20.059]  There are no side effects.
[01:32:20.399 --> 01:32:23.342]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:32:23.502 --> 01:32:25.384]  Eliminate the cost, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:32:25.824 --> 01:32:33.071]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:32:33.371 --> 01:32:36.754]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:32:37.174 --> 01:32:40.317]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[01:32:40.337 --> 01:32:40.597]  866-885-6625.
[01:32:40.617 --> 01:32:40.697]  866-885-6625.
[01:32:40.717 --> 01:32:41.618]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:32:41.638 --> 01:32:41.838]  Call today.
[01:33:06.861 --> 01:33:12.947]  All right, Mark and Norm and others that are holding, your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:33:14.308 --> 01:33:23.096]  Joel Skousen, I mean it's clear when the British Environment Minister, number three guy in the Blair government, Michael Meacher,
[01:33:24.122 --> 01:33:29.727]  goes public a few months ago and says that the globalists, that is, the Bushes, didn't carry out 9-11.
[01:33:30.348 --> 01:33:32.830]  They certainly had knowledge of it and funded them.
[01:33:33.551 --> 01:33:36.534]  Clearly, that is the left-wing side of the UN.
[01:33:38.596 --> 01:33:45.042]  Again, that's why Europe has allowed all the facts that the military-industrial complex carried out 9-11 to come forward.
[01:33:46.005 --> 01:33:54.368]  So I agree with you on that, but just in a few minutes, your analysis of 9-11, and then we'll start going to some polls.
[01:33:55.049 --> 01:34:04.692]  Well, you know, one of the most interesting conundrums in the 9-11 is how do you get, if the Arabs were in fact the ones hijacking these airplanes, and that is still for doubt.
[01:34:04.732 --> 01:34:09.214]  Now, there is virtually no confirmable evidence that the United States has given anywhere
[01:34:09.989 --> 01:34:13.091]  Of the true identity of Arabs, or if they were in fact on the planes.
[01:34:13.191 --> 01:34:18.893]  We have been denied any video security footage of any Arabs walking aboard that airplane.
[01:34:18.953 --> 01:34:20.374]  We've denied any of the lists.
[01:34:21.114 --> 01:34:29.218]  Simply, we've been denied all of the conversations between the FAA and the pilots as the pilots would have declared an emergency about the hijacking.
[01:34:29.238 --> 01:34:32.300]  Well now, nine of the hijackers have been found alive and dead.
[01:34:33.107 --> 01:34:41.010]  And what's more interesting is, with the capture of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the supposed mastermind, over nine months ago, the U.S.
[01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:47.432]  has continued to leak supposed admissions of Mohammed that confirm the government position.
[01:34:47.472 --> 01:34:52.053]  But what's very strange is, he has never made any statement, according to the U.S.,
[01:34:53.092 --> 01:34:54.593]  About how they got their training.
[01:34:54.693 --> 01:35:00.075]  We know they didn't get their training in these aircraft if they in fact were the Flyers and the Hijackers.
[01:35:00.095 --> 01:35:01.515]  They didn't get their training in Cessnas.
[01:35:01.555 --> 01:35:10.539]  I can tell you as a fighter pilot, it would be very, you know, I could probably handle one of those aircraft even never having flown it before.
[01:35:11.059 --> 01:35:13.360]  But you have to have a tremendous amount of training.
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:16.941]  And none of these people had any competency to be able to accomplish that.
[01:35:17.601 --> 01:35:21.703]  So, either these flight training in the Cessna was simply a cover
[01:35:22.406 --> 01:35:50.750]  to be a lot to allow the story to go forward that this is how they got trained to cover for some of the middle eastern country aligned with the bush administration who who actually did the training or in fact they never were hijacked by these particular alright well let me throw something in the pot here uh... again obviously folks I've made two films written a book on 9-11 and only covered some of the evidence there's so many smoking guns it is a ledger or a story or a patsy fallback
[01:35:51.423 --> 01:35:56.486]  That they were trained at those local flight schools, where they would get in the Cessnas and then jump out on the runway.
[01:35:57.367 --> 01:36:16.940]  Which shows they couldn't fly, which then makes it more confusing that MSNBC, Pensacola News Journal, and this is admitted, that at least seven of the supposed hijackers were trained in a secret program in 1999 under the CIA at the Pensacola Naval Air Station in some type of secret operation.
[01:36:17.861 --> 01:36:19.102]  Now, what do you say to them apples?
[01:36:21.843 --> 01:36:22.824]  I'm just not sure.
[01:36:23.825 --> 01:36:30.490]  I haven't seen any verifiable documentation about that claim.
[01:36:31.071 --> 01:36:31.711]  I've read it.
[01:36:32.111 --> 01:36:33.032]  I know what you're saying.
[01:36:33.893 --> 01:36:37.196]  But they haven't given us any names, any other way to confirm that.
[01:36:37.516 --> 01:36:38.557]  That would be highly unlikely.
[01:36:38.677 --> 01:36:39.878]  I trained at Pensacola.
[01:36:41.219 --> 01:36:42.620]  I know the facilities there.
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:46.163]  I don't think that would have given them the training sufficient to do so.
[01:36:46.823 --> 01:36:52.149]  They have an Arab-speaking flight school at Fort Worth that they could have flown in with government visas.
[01:36:52.429 --> 01:36:53.571]  They didn't do it there either.
[01:36:54.512 --> 01:37:06.606]  I still think that in order to do this, if they did have Arabs flying these things, and that's still in doubt, they were trained in full-sized aircraft, not simulators, in Libya, in Saudi Arabia,
[01:37:07.507 --> 01:37:09.970]  Uh, not Iraq, but perhaps Iran too.
[01:37:26.741 --> 01:37:27.622]  Saying all this.
[01:37:27.962 --> 01:37:30.945]  We have the public officials being warned not to fly.
[01:37:31.025 --> 01:37:31.665]  That's admitted.
[01:37:32.486 --> 01:37:34.648]  We have Solomon Rushdie being warned not to fly.
[01:37:35.388 --> 01:37:36.229]  Mayor Willie Brown.
[01:37:36.269 --> 01:37:36.990]  We have all this.
[01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:38.311]  We have the insider trading.
[01:37:38.371 --> 01:37:39.772]  We have Bush Sr.
[01:37:39.812 --> 01:37:41.694]  meeting with the head bin Laden that morning.
[01:37:42.314 --> 01:37:57.985]  In DC, we have, excuse me, in New York, at the same time in DC we have General Mahmoud Ahmed for his week-long meeting with the CIA that morning having breakfast with the House and Senate Intelligence Chairman.
[01:37:58.786 --> 01:38:02.508]  We have all of this, and again, that's just a small portion of it.
[01:38:03.109 --> 01:38:04.209]  How does all that tie together?
[01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:08.722]  In my opinion, there's only one who really could have benefited from this.
[01:38:08.902 --> 01:38:11.404]  It certainly wouldn't have benefited the Muslim nations.
[01:38:11.504 --> 01:38:21.630]  It would only have benefited an administration who had a globalist orientation, who wanted to set up agent provocateur incidents in order to justify the dismantling of U.S.
[01:38:21.670 --> 01:38:22.791]  constitutional protections.
[01:38:22.911 --> 01:38:25.013]  And that is exactly what has happened.
[01:38:25.233 --> 01:38:28.355]  So, I'm pointing the finger at the Bush administration.
[01:38:28.415 --> 01:38:31.697]  But more than just George Bush, because I believe he's a script reader,
[01:38:32.245 --> 01:38:33.566]  I think it goes higher than that.
[01:38:33.606 --> 01:38:40.209]  It goes to the shadow government that has been working in the Clinton administration, the former Bush administration.
[01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:47.013]  I don't believe Reagan was a knowing conspirator in that shadow government, but I think they controlled him through George Bush and other people.
[01:38:47.353 --> 01:38:49.454]  Well, the historical record shows that.
[01:38:49.474 --> 01:38:57.578]  Reagan was talking about getting rid of the IRS, saying there were scams, and then suddenly he gets shot and everything changes.
[01:38:58.238 --> 01:39:02.724]  Uh, but at the same time, Joel, I mean, you've been in the, you know, higher levels of the Republican Party.
[01:39:03.104 --> 01:39:04.526]  You're a prominent guy saying this.
[01:39:04.566 --> 01:39:06.488]  A lot of others are talking about this.
[01:39:06.568 --> 01:39:12.134]  But exactly, we see them setting up this high-tech police state in the aftermath of 9-11.
[01:39:12.455 --> 01:39:14.117]  We see the borders still wide open.
[01:39:14.924 --> 01:39:23.547]  And I know that the Globalists carried out, the Anglo-American Skull and Bones side of it, the Bohemian Grove Club side, carried out 9-11.
[01:39:23.647 --> 01:39:33.849]  I know they told the men that carried this out that, well, we're doing this to get the people mobilized because they don't know we're about to have to have a war with Russia and China.
[01:39:34.290 --> 01:39:37.230]  That's how they sold it to the men to carry this out.
[01:39:37.490 --> 01:39:42.532]  But they have to know that their bosses are setting up their own command and control model here.
[01:39:43.632 --> 01:39:47.874]  So, how do we reach out to the people who actually engineered this?
[01:39:49.475 --> 01:39:55.118]  Well, I'm not so sure that they had, you know, that you can sell legitimate patriotic people on this.
[01:39:55.318 --> 01:40:01.701]  You might use, I think it would be much more logical to say they used actual dark side operators.
[01:40:02.181 --> 01:40:07.123]  The whole slew of these people in the CIA who know how to fly all the various aircraft,
[01:40:09.093 --> 01:40:11.574]  You know, there's rumors that this could have been done remote control.
[01:40:11.814 --> 01:40:18.497]  I don't know of any legitimate military people who would have done these deeds, even if they were given an excuse that just too easy.
[01:40:18.517 --> 01:40:20.998]  Well, Hitler found people to burn the Reichstag.
[01:40:21.058 --> 01:40:24.099]  Hitler found people to kill the folks at the radio station.
[01:40:24.119 --> 01:40:26.920]  Yeah, it only took two or three, though, to burn down the Reichstag.
[01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:28.281]  Well, exactly, but...
[01:40:30.287 --> 01:40:35.710]  I mean, they've always found... Yeah, but they're dark side operators.
[01:40:35.810 --> 01:40:38.871]  They don't take legitimate military people.
[01:40:39.011 --> 01:40:44.654]  Most of the soldiers in the Nazi period... Well, of course, I meant people in government.
[01:40:45.194 --> 01:40:48.115]  But again, a lot of them are deluding themselves to do it.
[01:40:48.235 --> 01:40:50.697]  Or are you saying these are just actual evil people?
[01:40:50.977 --> 01:40:52.878]  Yeah, I'm saying they're actual evil people.
[01:40:52.918 --> 01:40:54.038]  They're unprincipled people.
[01:40:54.058 --> 01:40:55.439]  We know how the CIA
[01:40:56.391 --> 01:40:56.991]  I think so.
[01:41:12.842 --> 01:41:16.183]  Of this level of corruption and insensitivity to conscience.
[01:41:16.404 --> 01:41:18.304]  It's a very real process.
[01:41:18.625 --> 01:41:25.948]  But when I say get folks to come forward, I mean those in NORAD who heard the voice of Dick Cheney who took control of the shadow government.
[01:41:25.988 --> 01:41:26.648]  That's now admitted.
[01:41:26.668 --> 01:41:29.769]  They won't release the transcripts of what his voice was saying.
[01:41:30.490 --> 01:41:32.350]  They had the quote, stand out of NORAD.
[01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:37.853]  It is admitted that the CIA was running a drill of flying planes in the buildings in New York and DC that morning.
[01:41:37.893 --> 01:41:39.974]  That's how they were able to order him to stand down.
[01:41:41.352 --> 01:41:52.575]  And, you know, I've had emails from people who direct contact with the controllers at military airports that got the order to shut down the flight line and not let anyone take off to intercept these aircraft.
[01:41:52.715 --> 01:41:58.056]  And Bob Dole's former chief of staff, Stanley Hilton, has, by the way, deposed a lot of those folks.
[01:41:59.997 --> 01:42:07.039]  Yeah, as I say, we need to work on a list of that and get this thing really nailed down.
[01:42:07.987 --> 01:42:12.212]  You know, it's a possibility of breaking this thing open if we can get some people on tape.
[01:42:13.793 --> 01:42:14.474]  Absolutely.
[01:42:16.276 --> 01:42:18.578]  Just a one minute answer on this and we'll go to the calls, folks.
[01:42:18.598 --> 01:42:19.379]  I know you've been patient.
[01:42:21.061 --> 01:42:22.002]  How do we stop it?
[01:42:22.950 --> 01:42:34.359]  And be honest, do you think we can stop it, or at least get a stalemate, and not have them launch an even bigger terror attack, because it's clear 9-11 was only a primer for that imperial mobilization.
[01:42:34.759 --> 01:42:35.179]  That's right.
[01:42:35.279 --> 01:42:43.265]  We're guaranteed to have other high-profile attacks, and the proof that we don't have real terrorist cells in this country is we have no normal terrorism.
[01:42:43.426 --> 01:42:46.908]  No car bombings, no suicide bombings, no electrical pylon bombings.
[01:42:46.948 --> 01:42:47.889]  That's the easy stuff.
[01:42:48.089 --> 01:42:48.970]  We have none of that.
[01:42:49.670 --> 01:42:51.752]  That's the proof we don't have a real Al Qaeda.
[01:42:52.282 --> 01:42:56.806]  It is a government terrorist operation in order to justify what we're doing.
[01:42:56.866 --> 01:42:57.526]  Can we stop it?
[01:42:57.927 --> 01:42:59.588]  I don't think so, frankly, Alex.
[01:43:00.209 --> 01:43:02.310]  That doesn't mean that we have to stop fighting.
[01:43:03.411 --> 01:43:15.041]  I think the only chance of ever breaking it loose, of course, is to expose the conspiracy word, which the media will not allow us to utter in mainstream sources, lest they laugh you off the stage.
[01:43:16.271 --> 01:43:30.214]  Unfortunately, because of the lockdown control and the fact that they have over the news and information, even our internet access to people doesn't seem to be enough to break loose, enough to cause a change.
[01:43:30.514 --> 01:43:35.736]  Even if we did start to break loose, I think they'd pull a similar thing to the JFK assassination.
[01:43:35.756 --> 01:43:41.037]  They'll march out Walter Cronkite to debunk these theories, and they'll only pick the easy things to debunk.
[01:43:41.508 --> 01:43:47.550]  And I'll do a public television special, and people will nod their head and say, oh yeah, they've got answers to these.
[01:43:47.670 --> 01:43:50.871]  Because they know deep down we're lazy and don't want to stand and fight.
[01:43:51.231 --> 01:43:52.751]  Yeah, that's the problem.
[01:43:52.891 --> 01:43:58.133]  But Joel... But we've got to build a remnant of people who do know, because I don't think they'll take us all down.
[01:43:58.173 --> 01:44:06.075]  And I think there will be in this next Third World War scenario, when they nuke this nation, it's not going to kill everybody.
[01:44:06.155 --> 01:44:07.495]  It's probably only going to kill 20%.
[01:44:08.056 --> 01:44:09.516]  Now that's horrendous.
[01:44:09.943 --> 01:44:11.844]  Because I think they're only going to hit military targets.
[01:44:12.405 --> 01:44:26.275]  But I think that there will be a loss of control for a period of time of this conspiracy, and I think it's potential to be able to mobilize a resistance if enough people can understand what the real threat is.
[01:44:27.756 --> 01:44:33.560]  We are going to go to the calls, but also I've heard you make the good point that
[01:44:34.173 --> 01:44:42.684]  Well, going back, my point is, back when you're really fighting terrorism, you ignore it, you don't play it up, you don't create fear off of it, because that's what the terrorists want.
[01:44:43.792 --> 01:44:48.594]  Again, showing that the government is, the control arms there, are behind the terrorism.
[01:44:48.955 --> 01:44:50.796]  They do play it up.
[01:44:50.896 --> 01:44:56.678]  They give us the definition of terrorism, scaring us for political or personal gain.
[01:44:56.878 --> 01:45:04.442]  And you've gone over the fact that Al-Qaeda didn't supposedly exist until just a few years ago, and how it's supposedly this giant organization.
[01:45:05.303 --> 01:45:07.384]  I mean, this is so transparent.
[01:45:07.564 --> 01:45:09.264]  And so impotent.
[01:45:11.045 --> 01:45:12.126]  This organization has
[01:45:12.546 --> 01:45:18.009]  Billions of dollars from Saudi Arabia, and yet it's so impotent that they can't do one normal terrorist attack.
[01:45:18.309 --> 01:45:19.770]  You can't have it both ways.
[01:45:20.471 --> 01:45:23.853]  Either it exists as the huge organization, or it doesn't.
[01:45:24.073 --> 01:45:25.554]  And I say, it doesn't.
[01:45:25.634 --> 01:45:26.894]  It's a small cadre.
[01:45:27.395 --> 01:45:30.997]  It's a shell of an organization that's controlled at the top by the CIA.
[01:45:33.817 --> 01:45:37.318]  And that's historically admitted, but the media likes to ignore that, Joel.
[01:45:37.638 --> 01:45:39.299]  Yeah, you know, they claim they lost control.
[01:45:39.379 --> 01:45:40.019]  Where's the proof?
[01:45:40.379 --> 01:45:44.740]  In fact, we don't get anything about Al-Qaeda, except if it comes from U.S.
[01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:45.240]  intelligence.
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:47.641]  There's virtually no independent sources.
[01:45:48.021 --> 01:45:52.982]  Even MI6, the British government, simply parrots what they get from the CIA.
[01:45:54.483 --> 01:45:55.963]  And so do the European agencies.
[01:45:56.003 --> 01:45:57.503]  Everybody's talking about Al-Qaeda.
[01:45:57.523 --> 01:46:01.785]  Everybody's talking about this suspect has links to Al-Qaeda, but that's just a standard phrase.
[01:46:02.105 --> 01:46:03.145]  There's virtually no proof.
[01:46:04.151 --> 01:46:13.466]  Well, also, whether it's the Philippines or England or Israel, every time I see a terrorist attack and we go investigate it, it leads back to the government.
[01:46:14.187 --> 01:46:15.629]  And again, the governments have the motives.
[01:46:15.689 --> 01:46:16.851]  Yes, it is terrorism.
[01:46:16.871 --> 01:46:19.135]  The terrorists attacked us because they hate our freedom.
[01:46:19.904 --> 01:46:21.404]  That's why the New World Order attacked us!
[01:46:21.424 --> 01:46:22.285]  To get rid of our freedom!
[01:46:22.465 --> 01:46:23.325]  That's actually true!
[01:46:23.385 --> 01:46:23.725]  Nice!
[01:46:24.125 --> 01:46:25.786]  That's an interesting take on that subject.
[01:46:25.826 --> 01:46:26.806]  I had not thought of that one.
[01:46:26.926 --> 01:46:28.527]  Well, they love double meaning statements.
[01:46:28.747 --> 01:46:29.507]  Let's go to the calls.
[01:46:29.607 --> 01:46:31.307]  Mark in Minnesota.
[01:46:31.327 --> 01:46:32.588]  You're on the air with Joel Skelson.
[01:46:32.608 --> 01:46:32.928]  Go ahead.
[01:46:33.148 --> 01:46:33.828]  Hey, how are you guys doing?
[01:46:33.848 --> 01:46:35.349]  Hello?
[01:46:35.589 --> 01:46:36.289]  Good, thank you.
[01:46:36.309 --> 01:46:36.609]  Go ahead.
[01:46:36.629 --> 01:46:37.149]  Semper Fi.
[01:46:38.110 --> 01:46:38.950]  Semper Fi to you.
[01:46:38.970 --> 01:46:39.810]  I was in the Marine Corps.
[01:46:41.431 --> 01:46:45.652]  By the way, I don't know if you heard about one of the latest events with
[01:46:46.935 --> 01:47:02.445]  uh... that would indicate government involvement in 9-11 but uh... there was an Al-Qaeda tape that was uh... filmed, video produced, it was filmed of the World Trade Center attack which only the government was supposed to have and it ended up in the hands of Al-Qaeda.
[01:47:03.285 --> 01:47:06.267]  That was all over uh... NBC, that was a few weeks ago.
[01:47:06.767 --> 01:47:07.588]  Yeah, I saw that.
[01:47:07.648 --> 01:47:08.468]  Joel, did you see that?
[01:47:08.688 --> 01:47:09.229]  No, I didn't.
[01:47:09.289 --> 01:47:10.209]  Tell me what happened there.
[01:47:11.110 --> 01:47:16.353]  uh... I guess it's my understanding it was they might have been like actually massaged
[01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:17.520]  Operatives.
[01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:24.202]  And they filmed, they videotaped the World Trade Center attack as it happened.
[01:47:24.623 --> 01:47:26.483]  That's not an urban legend, by the way.
[01:47:26.563 --> 01:47:36.347]  It is admitted, they arrested those guys, they were Mossad, they went to the moving company, everything had been pulled out, and the owner was a well-known intelligence operative.
[01:47:36.927 --> 01:47:45.190]  And the FBI seized the video footage, and it was all over mainstream news, NBC, and so forth.
[01:47:47.009 --> 01:47:53.851]  Only the government was supposed to have this tape, and somehow it ended up in the hands of Al-Qaeda, and Al-Qaeda was playing the tape.
[01:47:53.871 --> 01:47:56.352]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:47:56.372 --> 01:47:57.532]  Isn't that interesting, Joel?
[01:47:57.872 --> 01:47:58.613]  Yeah, it really is.
[01:47:58.653 --> 01:48:06.035]  Of course, one must not lead to the conclusion, as some have, that 9-11 was an Israeli operation.
[01:48:06.517 --> 01:48:12.340]  If the Mossad was involved, it's because they were, you know, there's a seamless relationship between the Mossad and the CIA.
[01:48:12.380 --> 01:48:26.106]  Well, that's my point, is the FBI went on, the Deputy Director, a month after 9-11, two months after, actually, went on Fox News and said, we arrested 142 Israeli operatives who were shadowing Al-Qaeda.
[01:48:26.286 --> 01:48:28.688]  We think they may have let this happen.
[01:48:28.928 --> 01:48:33.410]  And I think there was some type of weird blackmail going on, you know, in international news, infighting.
[01:48:33.770 --> 01:48:35.411]  And I pointed out, I said, okay, well,
[01:48:36.111 --> 01:48:43.494]  If you were following them and the rest of the Israelis a month before 9-11, that means that you knew, too.
[01:48:43.574 --> 01:48:46.255]  But see, they don't think that we can think.
[01:48:46.455 --> 01:48:50.437]  I mean, can Israel order NORAD to stand down, Joel?
[01:48:50.697 --> 01:48:52.238]  Yeah, that's precisely the point.
[01:48:52.338 --> 01:48:56.939]  But there is a seamless relationship between the Mossad and the CIA, so that it's indistinguishable.
[01:48:56.959 --> 01:48:59.941]  You cannot say when the Mossad is involved that this is Israel.
[01:49:00.121 --> 01:49:01.621]  This is just as much the U.S.
[01:49:02.102 --> 01:49:03.222]  if the Mossad is involved.
[01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:06.514]  Yeah, they're just different compartments of really the same operation.
[01:49:06.915 --> 01:49:17.670]  But the other thing, I'm curious, what do you think the nexus is between Bush's Jobs for Illegal Aliens program and filling some of these police state apparatus jobs?
[01:49:18.763 --> 01:49:22.585]  Oh yeah, they say, what, 20,000 of the troops over there aren't even U.S.
[01:49:22.625 --> 01:49:34.989]  citizens in Iraq, in our contingent, and now they're saying, we'll join the military, we'll make you a citizen automatically, and filling the police forces with them, Joel?
[01:49:35.489 --> 01:49:45.453]  Yeah, I think that there is a need to bring in more and larger troops that can fulfill dark side operations.
[01:49:46.073 --> 01:49:46.994]  You know, the Americans,
[01:49:48.035 --> 01:49:52.658]  Who are in police forces, there is a fair amount of resistance against doing some of these operations.
[01:49:53.198 --> 01:49:54.839]  For example, they've stopped really doing it.
[01:49:54.879 --> 01:50:07.166]  In the 80s we had lots of whistleblowers coming out of the US military, flyboys, helicopter pilots who were flying drugs for the CIA and finally got tired of it and they all, you know, we have dozens of whistleblowers.
[01:50:07.406 --> 01:50:11.248]  You know, you don't hardly ever hear any of those whistleblowers and that's because they're not using
[01:50:11.781 --> 01:50:18.343]  Normal, patriotic... That's right, they shifted back into MENA and using governors and local sheriffs and... Yeah, they're not doing that anymore.
[01:50:18.863 --> 01:50:19.163]  Alex?
[01:50:19.784 --> 01:50:21.124]  Yeah, I've got to let you go, Mark.
[01:50:21.204 --> 01:50:21.684]  Thanks for the call.
[01:50:21.704 --> 01:50:24.945]  We're going to come back and talk to Norm and others with Joel Skelson in our final segment.
[01:50:25.185 --> 01:50:26.746]  Probably have a few calls in real quick.
[01:50:27.746 --> 01:50:30.087]  But, yeah, this is all very, very serious.
[01:50:30.307 --> 01:50:32.248]  And it's classic bringing in foreign forces.
[01:50:32.288 --> 01:50:35.269]  I mean, the British did it twice with German mercenaries.
[01:50:35.509 --> 01:50:37.049]  Did they not, Joel?
[01:50:37.089 --> 01:50:37.989]  Yes, they certainly did.
[01:50:38.250 --> 01:50:39.450]  They're back in the Revolutionary War.
[01:50:40.258 --> 01:50:45.315]  Absolutely, and then again into the next century down on the southern coast.
[01:50:46.042 --> 01:50:53.227]  Alright folks, we'll be right back with a couple more calls, then we'll go back into the board discussion, and then back to the, uh, stay with us.
[01:51:16.202 --> 01:51:17.983]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:51:18.063 --> 01:51:28.709]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:51:28.869 --> 01:51:30.770]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:55:10.565 --> 01:55:12.346]  Let's talk to Norm in Colorado.
[01:55:12.386 --> 01:55:13.146]  Norm, you're on the air.
[01:55:13.186 --> 01:55:13.586]  Go ahead.
[01:55:14.786 --> 01:55:15.406]  Good day, gentlemen.
[01:55:16.207 --> 01:55:16.587]  Good day.
[01:55:17.327 --> 01:55:19.947]  Yes, I've got two of the right people to ask this question.
[01:55:19.987 --> 01:55:21.868]  I'll be real quick so someone else can talk.
[01:55:23.330 --> 01:55:26.391]  This thing with the border crossings and the amnesty, etc.
[01:55:26.671 --> 01:55:44.234]  I heard a man from Stanford Research Institute in the seventies, early eighties, stipulate that the futurists think was Texas would secede from the Union, Mexico would disappear, there would be a war, and I'm wondering if this would be the catalyst that might instigate that.
[01:55:44.274 --> 01:55:45.114]  What do you people know?
[01:55:45.134 --> 01:55:47.975]  Do you want me to respond to that?
[01:55:48.155 --> 01:55:48.395]  Please.
[01:55:49.580 --> 01:55:53.404]  I don't believe Texas will secede from the Union.
[01:55:53.424 --> 01:55:56.768]  I think that's a foregone scenario.
[01:55:57.349 --> 01:56:04.036]  I do think they do intend to amalgamate the countries through this NAFTA Free Trade Area of the Americas.
[01:56:04.997 --> 01:56:06.379]  This is setting the stage for
[01:56:07.372 --> 01:56:08.993]  Yeah, that is of course our political power.
[01:56:09.253 --> 01:56:11.195]  That's publicly admitted, Norm.
[01:56:11.295 --> 01:56:21.643]  I mean, they admit from Chile to Alaska, one giant body with its own currencies, but all marked to the same value with the same digital stamp on them.
[01:56:23.424 --> 01:56:24.705]  I'll go and let someone else talk.
[01:56:24.745 --> 01:56:25.085]  Thank you.
[01:56:25.265 --> 01:56:25.886]  Thank you, Norm.
[01:56:25.906 --> 01:56:26.626]  Appreciate that.
[01:56:27.007 --> 01:56:28.228]  Mike in Arizona.
[01:56:28.248 --> 01:56:29.008]  You're on the air.
[01:56:32.191 --> 01:56:32.851]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:56:32.891 --> 01:56:33.592]  You're on the air.
[01:56:33.932 --> 01:56:35.633]  Hi, Joel and Alex.
[01:56:36.614 --> 01:56:36.734]  Yes.
[01:56:37.307 --> 01:56:37.827]  I'm curious.
[01:56:38.528 --> 01:56:50.718]  We know that five of the six oligarchs, or maybe four out of five nowadays, of the oligarchs are Jewish and equally at home in Tel Aviv as they are in Moscow.
[01:56:51.319 --> 01:56:57.564]  You speak of a Russian bloc pushing for the global government.
[01:56:58.725 --> 01:57:05.490]  Does that coincide with the Zionist group headed up by people like Bronfen?
[01:57:07.322 --> 01:57:08.583]  And Rothschild?
[01:57:09.784 --> 01:57:13.226]  Who exactly are we talking about heading up this Moscow block?
[01:57:14.387 --> 01:57:28.257]  Well, in my opinion, the oligarchs were the true hidden powers behind the throne in the Soviet era, who bequeathed themselves the riches of the Soviet state industries and then turned themselves into a mafia.
[01:57:28.417 --> 01:57:33.181]  They're no more a mafia than the man on the moon in terms of an Italian-style mafia.
[01:57:33.221 --> 01:57:34.141]  This is, in fact,
[01:57:35.683 --> 01:57:38.465]  You know, fronting for the Communist Party there in Russia.
[01:57:38.525 --> 01:57:55.295]  Now, the fact that a large percentage of them are Jews should not, in my opinion, be interpreted as a Zionist, pro-Zionism conspiracy, because these people work against their Jewishness as much as anyone else does.
[01:57:55.475 --> 01:57:58.677]  Well, it's now come out that a lot of Zionists actually supported Hitler.
[01:57:59.118 --> 01:57:59.738]  That's correct.
[01:58:00.379 --> 01:58:02.940]  And a lot of that was, you know, there's two sides of that.
[01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:07.702]  One was a certain percentage of them wanted to drive the Jews from Europe.
[01:58:07.762 --> 01:58:16.006]  They wouldn't leave their posh, wealthy lifestyles there and go to Israel, to drive them to Israel, execution to go forward.
[01:58:17.707 --> 01:58:28.031]  But in any case, I think it's very important to understand that even though there's a high percentage of Jews in key positions in the New World Order, they're not there because of their Jewishness, but against
[01:58:29.051 --> 01:58:30.233]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:43.738 --> 01:58:52.362]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:58:52.582 --> 01:59:03.848]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:59:04.068 --> 01:59:06.689]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:59:07.049 --> 01:59:13.516]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:59:13.676 --> 01:59:15.538]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:59:15.759 --> 01:59:21.785]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:59:22.026 --> 01:59:27.692]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[01:59:51.085 --> 01:59:52.165]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:52.866 --> 01:59:54.026]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:54.626 --> 01:59:55.447]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.187 --> 01:59:57.087]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.107 --> 02:00:01.389]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:01.949 --> 02:00:06.050]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:07.951 --> 02:00:17.274]  You look at the six oligarchs that supposedly run Russia, who are removed and replaced like chess pieces monthly, and five of the six aren't Jewish,
[02:00:18.098 --> 02:00:44.235]  And again, I'm not here defending Israel, I'm not defending any of these power blocs, but years ago I read a very well done history book, because I've read enough history to know it was accurate from other perspectives, about how the church and how the different royalty would learn that they like to have a small minority in control of certain industries so they could rob them of it routinely.
[02:00:44.295 --> 02:00:46.637]  So what you have is this weird symbiotic relationship
[02:00:47.410 --> 02:00:57.784]  That's why you'll see Nazis at the table, you know, with the Rothschilds, hanging out together, setting up the Bilderberg Group, and engaging in eugenics, you know, putting the AIDS and the vaccines in Africa.
[02:00:58.285 --> 02:01:03.412]  You know, if they're so multicultural, why are they, you know, getting rid of all these Asians and blacks and others?
[02:01:04.148 --> 02:01:21.721]  And so what you have is, going back at least a thousand years, is this relationship where you have minions for the Dutch, the British, the German families, and the British are German, who have Jewish ex-checkers, or minions.
[02:01:21.761 --> 02:01:25.864]  And that was because Jews knew how to read and write, and understood banking.
[02:01:26.384 --> 02:01:28.466]  And that's how they early on got into those positions.
[02:01:28.546 --> 02:01:34.431]  But, again, and the globalists will routinely cut loose their Jewish minions and allow them to be killed.
[02:01:34.711 --> 02:01:35.992]  Joel, is that accurate to say?
[02:01:36.092 --> 02:01:37.654]  Yeah, you know, I think it basically is.
[02:01:38.154 --> 02:01:42.938]  I never have seen the powers that be allow a Jew to rise to the very top.
[02:01:43.879 --> 02:01:46.201]  They've always been used as second level people.
[02:01:46.241 --> 02:01:47.141]  They're very smart.
[02:01:47.221 --> 02:01:48.362]  They're very controlling.
[02:01:48.522 --> 02:01:50.804]  They have an elitist feeling.
[02:01:50.844 --> 02:01:53.987]  These people that get involved with the New World Order, they like to control other people.
[02:01:54.660 --> 02:01:55.980]  But they're used, essentially.
[02:01:56.801 --> 02:02:01.342]  But I've never seen one of them actually operating on behalf of Israel in a benevolent sense.
[02:02:01.882 --> 02:02:11.484]  They're working against any form of sovereignty and against any form of religious Jewry.
[02:02:11.524 --> 02:02:14.685]  Well, look at the UN who is against Israel!
[02:02:17.066 --> 02:02:18.246]  So, there you have it right there.
[02:02:18.506 --> 02:02:20.386]  Let's take a few calls here.
[02:02:20.426 --> 02:02:22.287]  Let's talk to Eric in Texas.
[02:02:22.307 --> 02:02:22.807]  Go ahead, Eric.
[02:02:23.496 --> 02:02:24.777]  Yes sir, Alex.
[02:02:25.037 --> 02:02:25.918]  I'd like to make a comment.
[02:02:25.958 --> 02:02:28.520]  I wanted to ask a question, but I want to make a comment on the Jews.
[02:02:30.502 --> 02:02:41.071]  Many people don't realize the Turco-Finnish tribe actually co-opted the Jewish religion around the 10th century, and now a lot of people believe they're Israeli.
[02:02:44.516 --> 02:02:46.277]  Well, and it's not just that group.
[02:02:46.317 --> 02:02:54.725]  I mean, yeah, there's a lot of the top Jews are blonde-haired and blue-eyed, and there's actually a caste system in Israel where the folks that look like Palestinians, you know, are kind of looked down on.
[02:02:54.765 --> 02:02:56.286]  They're not the, quote, high-blooded.
[02:02:56.466 --> 02:03:01.971]  But I don't want to get off... I mean, I was talking about the New World Order here, and it goes back to this fetish of talking about this.
[02:03:02.192 --> 02:03:05.114]  We just need to fight evil, folks, regardless of who's behind it.
[02:03:06.596 --> 02:03:06.836]  Joel?
[02:03:08.297 --> 02:03:11.579]  Well, you know, that's a big controversy.
[02:03:12.420 --> 02:03:19.165]  There really is only evidence that the top tribal leaders converted to Judaism.
[02:03:19.185 --> 02:03:28.551]  There really isn't any confirmable evidence that the entire people did, and that that became the Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern Europe.
[02:03:28.571 --> 02:03:32.334]  So I still think that the jury's still out on that.
[02:03:33.034 --> 02:03:35.516]  Certainly the Ashkenazi, or European Jews,
[02:03:37.173 --> 02:03:41.597]  You know, they're very intelligent, very savvy people, a lot of good people.
[02:03:41.617 --> 02:03:44.820]  There's a lot of people who end up being controlling, turned to the left there.
[02:03:44.860 --> 02:03:51.065]  They're much more leftist in orientation than the Sephardic Jews, which come from the more Middle Eastern backgrounds.
[02:03:51.406 --> 02:03:53.588]  They tend to be the more right-wing, conservative Jews.
[02:03:55.089 --> 02:03:55.569]  All right.
[02:03:55.990 --> 02:03:58.312]  Thanks for the call, Eric.
[02:03:58.372 --> 02:03:59.212]  I appreciate that.
[02:03:59.273 --> 02:04:02.235]  Joel Skousen, how do folks get your fine newsletter?
[02:04:02.896 --> 02:04:04.097]  The World Affairs Brief is
[02:04:05.305 --> 02:04:08.369]  It's a weekly news analysis service I put out every Friday.
[02:04:08.389 --> 02:04:11.774]  It's got a modest subscription of $30 a year.
[02:04:12.335 --> 02:04:13.677]  There's a special on now.
[02:04:13.878 --> 02:04:14.899]  Anyone who goes to
[02:04:15.990 --> 02:04:16.370]  That's 1-800-644-1057.
[02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:17.451]  What's that number again?
[02:04:17.471 --> 02:04:17.531]  1-800-644-1057.
[02:04:17.551 --> 02:04:18.452]  Joel, I want to thank you for coming on.
[02:04:18.532 --> 02:04:20.893]  We look forward to having you back on in the near future.
[02:04:20.913 --> 02:04:22.734]  Appreciate that.
[02:04:22.954 --> 02:04:24.535]  We'll be back with a lot more.
[02:04:24.555 --> 02:04:28.098]  You'll want to stay with us for your calls as well.
[02:04:45.757 --> 02:04:50.439]  We all have busy lives and sometimes that causes us to miss out on the things that are most important to us.
[02:04:50.959 --> 02:04:54.120]  Well, when it comes to Genesis programs, you'll never have to miss out again.
[02:04:54.761 --> 02:05:00.683]  For only $19.95 plus $3 shipping and handling, you can receive an entire month of recorded GCN programs.
[02:05:01.203 --> 02:05:04.805]  That's right, an entire month for only $19.95 plus shipping and handling.
[02:05:05.265 --> 02:05:07.866]  The recordings are in MP3 format and compact disc.
[02:05:08.362 --> 02:05:12.147]  They're playable on computers along with most newer CD and DVD players.
[02:05:12.607 --> 02:05:16.593]  All you need to know is the name of the program you'd like a copy of and the month that it airs.
[02:05:17.113 --> 02:05:20.417]  Don't be left out of current news and information that affects our lives every day.

[02:05:45.481 --> 02:05:47.082]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:47.462 --> 02:05:53.205]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:05:53.465 --> 02:05:58.588]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:05:58.928 --> 02:06:08.213]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:06:08.553 --> 02:06:13.516]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:06:13.836 --> 02:06:17.858]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:06:18.058 --> 02:06:22.801]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:06:23.181 --> 02:06:29.084]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[02:06:29.424 --> 02:06:38.472]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:06:42.736 --> 02:06:43.837]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:06:45.378 --> 02:06:49.682]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:06:49.882 --> 02:06:54.226]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:06:56.817 --> 02:06:58.839]  This disaster is a new world order.
[02:06:58.939 --> 02:07:01.642]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:07:02.003 --> 02:07:06.228]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:07:06.288 --> 02:07:13.215]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:07:13.356 --> 02:07:15.358]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:07:15.598 --> 02:07:26.084]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:07:26.344 --> 02:07:31.707]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:07:36.690 --> 02:07:38.411]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:07:46.013 --> 02:07:52.034]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:07:52.635 --> 02:07:55.675]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:56.476 --> 02:07:58.236]  That's right, we're under attack.
[02:07:58.356 --> 02:08:00.356]  Our sovereignty is under attack.
[02:08:01.677 --> 02:08:03.717]  Our finances are under attack.
[02:08:03.817 --> 02:08:05.738]  Our spirits, our hearts are under attack.
[02:08:06.378 --> 02:08:10.559]  Our culture as Americans is being put in a wood chipper.
[02:08:12.919 --> 02:08:14.540]  And we stand here on the precipice.
[02:08:14.621 --> 02:08:40.602]  We have Lord Bush, the puppet nobody, neocon, doing what only a Judas Iscariot could do, get inside the conservative camp, neutralize you, to cut loose Taiwan, to call for totally open borders, blanket absolute complete amnesty, in perpetuity, all the other sellouts I can list, there's hundreds of them, protecting Bill Clinton, all of it.
[02:08:41.505 --> 02:08:45.050]  Bill Clinton coming to his aid saying he's sure there's weapons of mass destruction.
[02:08:45.130 --> 02:08:46.392]  Can't you see through this?
[02:08:46.872 --> 02:08:54.263]  Aren't you sick of the garbage, the soft soap you're given to pacify you, the Hannity's and the Limbaugh's and the rest of them?
[02:08:54.703 --> 02:08:56.646]  I mean, I want to vomit when I listen to it.
[02:08:58.951 --> 02:09:01.612]  And then to tell you, it's not an amnesty, it's a reform.
[02:09:01.813 --> 02:09:15.380]  Blanket, total amnesty, never before seen, in perpetuity, and they're going to pay to bring foreigners, not just from Latin America, which we're hemorrhaging to death from, but everywhere else, to drive down the wages, to bring in the foreign voting bloc, you name it.
[02:09:16.640 --> 02:09:19.122]  I know we've got Diane and others that are
[02:09:20.869 --> 02:09:21.729]  Patiently holding.
[02:09:21.789 --> 02:09:23.310]  Vince is holding and others are.
[02:09:23.330 --> 02:09:24.590]  We'll get to you here in just a few minutes.
[02:09:24.630 --> 02:09:25.090]  Stay with us.
[02:09:25.470 --> 02:09:27.451]  The toll free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[02:09:27.571 --> 02:09:43.935]  And we're going to have Keith Parker riding shotgun with us along with Paul Watson here in about 23 minutes from England to give us his perspective on the open borders there where they're bringing in the illegals.
[02:09:45.574 --> 02:09:52.599]  It looks like now the tunnel was built, and they admittedly allow thousands of illegals to pour across there each night.
[02:09:53.159 --> 02:10:03.426]  The Red Cross has built a big bivouac center with tents and indoor buildings for the thousands of illegals to feed them and fund them, and they laugh about it, to literally invade England.
[02:10:04.227 --> 02:10:07.269]  This was done by design, folks, to get rid of any sovereignty.
[02:10:08.246 --> 02:10:09.787]  Any type of identity.
[02:10:09.887 --> 02:10:12.409]  In Africa, they'll play one black tribe off against another.
[02:10:12.769 --> 02:10:14.991]  In Ireland, Catholic against Protestant.
[02:10:15.692 --> 02:10:19.153]  In the U.S., it's total balkanization from a hundred different angles.
[02:10:19.633 --> 02:10:24.654]  The host of a popular, very informative TV show here in Austin is Keith Parker.
[02:10:24.694 --> 02:10:25.714]  He's been on the show before.
[02:10:26.014 --> 02:10:26.854]  Texas Frontline.
[02:10:26.874 --> 02:10:34.495]  He's also been involved and interviewed a lot of great folks, hundreds of people from around the country on the immigration issue.
[02:10:35.095 --> 02:10:38.136]  And he's very eloquent and to the point with what we're facing.
[02:10:38.456 --> 02:10:40.816]  But to give you the Texas perspective is Keith Parker.
[02:10:41.056 --> 02:10:42.277]  Keith, thanks for coming on the show.
[02:10:42.297 --> 02:10:44.437]  Well, Alex, I appreciate you having me today.
[02:10:44.617 --> 02:10:44.917]  You bet.
[02:10:47.481 --> 02:11:07.292]  How'd you get into this, and over the years of studying this, where do you see it going, and what do you have to say about Bush totally opening the drawbridge and letting the enemy in, as they say they're the enemy, and at the same time telling us what a good job he's doing for us?
[02:11:08.013 --> 02:11:16.077]  Well, as far as the first part goes, in relation to how I got into it, I simply noticed from the time I was a teenager, I'm 39 now,
[02:11:16.772 --> 02:11:23.214]  That over time it seemed as if there were more and more people coming in from Mexico and a number of other places here.
[02:11:24.255 --> 02:11:26.916]  And I knew that they were here illegally.
[02:11:28.176 --> 02:11:34.739]  And I asked myself, don't we have a law that says they're not supposed to do this?
[02:11:35.759 --> 02:11:40.421]  And also, why do I have to obey the law if they don't?
[02:11:41.582 --> 02:11:45.343]  Which is something that everyone should ask themselves as I speak.
[02:11:45.908 --> 02:11:56.771]  George Bush is preparing to go and meet with Vicente Fox to discuss, and foist upon the American people, his amnesty in disguise.
[02:11:56.811 --> 02:11:58.472]  He calls it a guest worker program.
[02:11:58.852 --> 02:12:00.152]  But don't be fooled.
[02:12:00.612 --> 02:12:04.234]  A more accurate term would be a gradualized amnesty.
[02:12:06.514 --> 02:12:15.437]  Also, we need to take into consideration not only all the things that you've been talking about on your show,
[02:12:16.687 --> 02:12:30.032]  And by the way, I certainly appreciate the fact that you're getting this issue out there in front of people because you have a wide audience and it helps a great deal to have you out there hammering away at this day after day.
[02:12:31.852 --> 02:12:38.654]  But in relation to George Bush, everything that you said is completely and totally accurate, Alex.
[02:12:39.735 --> 02:12:46.077]  The Republican Party platform states in no uncertain terms that they are to uphold the law.
[02:12:47.216 --> 02:12:49.878]  As per immigration, as well as everything else.
[02:12:50.719 --> 02:13:04.230]  And yet, obviously, his actions speak much louder than his words, in that, at every opportunity, he seeks to aid and abet those who are in our country, in violation of our laws.
[02:13:04.930 --> 02:13:13.077]  Furthermore, he not only tolerates, but encourages the meddling of Vicente Fox, the head of a foreign power,
[02:13:13.741 --> 02:13:15.462]  In our internal affairs.
[02:13:15.522 --> 02:13:19.142]  We are in essence creating our own Palestinian problem.
[02:13:21.563 --> 02:13:29.825]  It's amazing and Keith, the same politicians that support Israel building a wall won't let us build a wall.
[02:13:30.425 --> 02:13:36.847]  The same politicians that build a wall around Afghanistan to control the drug trade won't let us have a wall.
[02:13:37.187 --> 02:13:39.828]  And we're supposedly under this endless terror alert
[02:13:40.368 --> 02:13:43.430]  Status about to be hit any second if we don't give all our rights up.
[02:13:43.450 --> 02:13:45.292]  But you talk about being above the law.
[02:13:45.692 --> 02:13:46.813]  Foreigners who come here.
[02:13:47.013 --> 02:13:48.354]  That's why no American.
[02:13:48.394 --> 02:13:52.237]  You don't see a Hispanic, a black guy, a white guy anymore owning a gas station.
[02:13:52.617 --> 02:13:56.680]  Why is it always from the Middle East or from India or China?
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:14:03.765]  Because people from foreign countries get seven to ten years of no income tax to start a business.
[02:14:04.165 --> 02:14:05.206]  That's right.
[02:14:05.246 --> 02:14:07.808]  Folks, ask yourselves, why would the government do that?
[02:14:08.048 --> 02:14:12.993]  Why would they say if you're a foreigner, you get something a citizen doesn't get?
[02:14:13.133 --> 02:14:15.395]  It is meant to destroy the middle class.
[02:14:15.495 --> 02:14:17.336]  It is meant to get control of you.
[02:14:17.556 --> 02:14:19.898]  It is meant to bring the hordes here.
[02:14:19.918 --> 02:14:21.700]  Now, I've been in third world countries.
[02:14:21.760 --> 02:14:22.561]  It's horrible.
[02:14:22.901 --> 02:14:25.303]  And we're starting to look like one in parts of Austin.
[02:14:26.207 --> 02:14:28.091]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:14:28.733 --> 02:14:30.737]  And Vicente Fox came.
[02:14:30.757 --> 02:14:32.421]  You were there, Keith, when we bullhorned him.
[02:14:33.423 --> 02:14:34.766]  He came to Austin, Texas.
[02:14:34.786 --> 02:14:35.829]  We shut down his speech.
[02:14:36.787 --> 02:14:40.170]  And we had white folks, black folks, Hispanics out there yelling at him.
[02:14:40.230 --> 02:14:41.532]  Everybody gets what's happening.
[02:14:42.092 --> 02:14:47.397]  And here comes Vicente Fox giving awards to the police department for not following the federal law.
[02:14:47.838 --> 02:14:55.405]  And to the big bank, Wells Fargo, for issuing them an ID card that's being accepted by police departments.
[02:14:55.745 --> 02:15:01.731]  This is like a Soviet or a Nazi coming here during World War II or something, or during the Cold War with the Soviets,
[02:15:02.431 --> 02:15:05.113]  And lobbying our local governments to secede!
[02:15:05.473 --> 02:15:06.874]  That's what's happening!
[02:15:07.034 --> 02:15:08.335]  Secede to Mexico!
[02:15:08.415 --> 02:15:08.855]  Go ahead.
[02:15:09.295 --> 02:15:13.858]  Exactly, and I'm glad you brought up the point about the gas stations, the convenience stores, etc.
[02:15:14.318 --> 02:15:15.759]  Because it goes well beyond that.
[02:15:15.879 --> 02:15:21.443]  Americans are being forced to subsidize their own replacement.
[02:15:22.063 --> 02:15:28.287]  You see, the problem with the American people, Alex, is that a lot of them still have a strong belief in the American dream.
[02:15:28.347 --> 02:15:29.948]  They feel like if they work hard,
[02:15:30.407 --> 02:15:42.275]  That they should get a living wage in return for that, and that their children should in turn have certain opportunities, and that in general, that if they're willing to work, they should have a pretty good life.
[02:15:42.715 --> 02:15:47.578]  But you see, that doesn't fit too well with corporate America or our overlords in Washington.
[02:15:48.099 --> 02:15:57.465]  What they want are a servile, ignorant people who are willing to work for minimum wage or, in some cases, perhaps less.
[02:15:58.018 --> 02:15:59.779]  Where are you going to find such people?
[02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:00.980]  The third world.
[02:16:01.420 --> 02:16:04.563]  Because there, there are no jobs, there are no opportunities.
[02:16:05.023 --> 02:16:08.986]  So they're more than happy to come here and work for three, four, five dollars an hour.
[02:16:09.426 --> 02:16:11.148]  Which is something Americans won't do.
[02:16:11.308 --> 02:16:15.491]  Time and time again, we're told that Americans are lazy.
[02:16:16.151 --> 02:16:20.394]  And that immigrants only take the jobs that Americans won't take.
[02:16:20.775 --> 02:16:21.675]  Let me tell you something.
[02:16:22.596 --> 02:16:25.438]  Many of the people I know work two jobs.
[02:16:25.925 --> 02:16:27.226]  Just to make ends meet.
[02:16:27.326 --> 02:16:28.366]  They're not getting rich.
[02:16:28.426 --> 02:16:29.487]  They're not getting ahead.
[02:16:29.847 --> 02:16:30.807]  They're doing well.
[02:16:30.927 --> 02:16:41.132]  Keith, I have friends who have master's degrees and they work for a corporation making $24,000 a year with that job.
[02:16:41.392 --> 02:16:42.713]  They're all about to be laid off.
[02:16:42.993 --> 02:16:45.554]  They run out and get jobs bagging groceries.
[02:16:45.874 --> 02:16:49.978]  And then they'll have another job where they'll start learning how to do plumbing.
[02:16:50.198 --> 02:17:01.047]  They're working 70, 80 hours a week, meanwhile their children are playing violent video games, learning how to snort cocaine, learning how to buy condoms, which are being pushed by the schools.
[02:17:01.628 --> 02:17:02.689]  I mean, this is sick!
[02:17:03.950 --> 02:17:09.513]  Exactly, but I want to know why somebody from India gets no income tax for 7 to 10 years.
[02:17:10.473 --> 02:17:11.974]  That is such discrimination!
[02:17:12.174 --> 02:17:15.436]  But again, the news never talks about it, so nobody knows about it, Keith.
[02:17:15.797 --> 02:17:24.201]  No, of course not, and the point being that any American that's willing to work 60, 70 hours a week just to make ends meet is not a lazy person.
[02:17:24.241 --> 02:17:27.303]  That's a person with a strong work ethic, Alex.
[02:17:28.889 --> 02:17:33.574]  More and more Americans all the time are adopting that ethic because they have no choice.
[02:17:33.634 --> 02:17:36.217]  They've got to in order to survive.
[02:17:36.741 --> 02:17:44.828]  See, Americans are not unwilling to do menial work, or dirty work, or work which may be regarded as unrewarding.
[02:17:45.069 --> 02:17:46.029]  And here's the difference.
[02:17:46.089 --> 02:17:55.798]  The illegals will live, ten people to a house, they don't pay the taxes, they're not invested, whereas a citizen cannot live on five, six, even eight dollars an hour.
[02:17:56.179 --> 02:18:03.105]  That's right, because they are expected to obey the law, and to pay all the taxes, fines, and fees.
[02:18:03.877 --> 02:18:08.941]  While obviously there's another set of rules... Did you know illegals hit people every day in Austin?
[02:18:08.981 --> 02:18:09.842]  I've talked to the police.
[02:18:10.362 --> 02:18:22.212]  They hit people, they kill people, they kill themselves, they get hurt, then they go to the hospital, get all the free treatment, and they didn't even have insurance, and nobody arrested them, and the next month they're back in a car, driving down the road drunk again.
[02:18:22.472 --> 02:18:26.035]  In fact, I ought to move to Mexico, move back here, I have more rights, Keith.
[02:18:26.596 --> 02:18:28.137]  Well, you have a good point, Alex.
[02:18:28.998 --> 02:18:31.500]  Also, we need to look at things
[02:18:32.176 --> 02:18:34.258]  Like the H-1B visa program.
[02:18:34.298 --> 02:18:44.866]  It's not simply a question now of illegal immigration, but of people being brought in from India and Pakistan and other places to take white collar jobs.
[02:18:44.966 --> 02:18:49.329]  And by the way, this new new amnesty does accelerate that.
[02:18:49.669 --> 02:18:50.970]  Yes, indeed it does.
[02:18:51.050 --> 02:18:57.715]  And we're often told by people like Dell and Motorola, well, we cannot find American engineers to take these jobs.
[02:18:57.755 --> 02:18:58.676]  There's not enough of them.
[02:18:58.696 --> 02:19:01.578]  And yet you have men that used to work for Motorola.
[02:19:02.430 --> 02:19:12.139]  Women that used to work for other computer companies who have many years, decades in some cases, of experience in engineering as regards to both software and hardware.
[02:19:12.159 --> 02:19:15.642]  Well, they also use the illegals to leverage those workers, American workers, down.
[02:19:15.723 --> 02:19:22.669]  I know engineers who've got two, three degrees who were making $100,000 a year, $80,000 a year, ten years ago.
[02:19:23.370 --> 02:19:26.272]  Keith, they're working for $15 an hour now here in Austin.
[02:19:26.492 --> 02:19:26.933]  You've got it.
[02:19:30.294 --> 02:19:31.616]  What about the future generations?
[02:19:31.656 --> 02:19:35.159]  How will they pay off college loans when they're going to get 15 bucks as an engineer?
[02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:39.443]  College will be nothing more than a pipe dream if things continue the way they are.
[02:19:39.604 --> 02:19:40.304]  That's right, Keith.
[02:19:40.324 --> 02:19:42.767]  We'll be right back with more of your info and calls.
[02:19:45.910 --> 02:19:48.973]  Hi, this is Jack Browner with a gold alert from Midas Resources.
[02:19:49.471 --> 02:19:51.492]  Folks, it's time to shed your complacency.
[02:19:51.832 --> 02:19:54.434]  Gold has seldom, if ever, been a better buy.
[02:19:54.814 --> 02:19:59.356]  Midas Resources is now in a position to potentially show you considerable profits.
[02:19:59.557 --> 02:20:01.337]  But you have to act now!
[02:20:01.538 --> 02:20:07.701]  We have $10 collector gold coins at the closest price to melt I've seen in my 24 years in the business.
[02:20:08.109 --> 02:20:14.650]  These are the same coins that are likely to soon command substantial premium prices as they have in the past.
[02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:18.411]  We can deliver them to you now with minimal downside risk.
[02:20:18.671 --> 02:20:22.112]  Or we can let you buy them later at a considerable higher price.
[02:20:22.532 --> 02:20:24.813]  Don't buy them later, folks.
[02:20:25.173 --> 02:20:25.993]  Do it now.
[02:20:26.253 --> 02:20:28.453]  That's $10 collector gold coins.
[02:20:28.853 --> 02:20:34.415]  $10 and $20 collector gold coins at the nearest amount in my 24 years in this business.
[02:20:34.495 --> 02:20:35.615]  Call Midas Resources.
[02:20:36.983 --> 02:20:37.825]  That's Midas at 800-686-2237.
[02:20:45.211 --> 02:20:48.774]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[02:20:49.094 --> 02:20:49.414]  Yes.
[02:20:49.715 --> 02:20:52.076]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood.
[02:20:52.357 --> 02:20:54.518]  The richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[02:20:54.638 --> 02:21:03.565]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, 2 ounces of juice have the same nutrition as 3 pounds of choice garden produce.
[02:21:03.725 --> 02:21:11.431]  The get-up-and-go energy, healing, blood building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.
[02:21:11.631 --> 02:21:13.873]  Hi, I'm Alan Davison at Monocot Wheatgrass.
[02:21:14.193 --> 02:21:21.237]  The 200 pages of our book, Wheatgrass, Nature's Finest Medicine, will remove any anxieties you may have about your nutritional supply.
[02:21:21.418 --> 02:21:25.100]  In this kit, you will receive no monthly bills, no monthly pills.
[02:21:25.260 --> 02:21:26.881]  This is real self-sufficiency.

[02:21:44.258 --> 02:21:46.219]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[02:21:46.299 --> 02:21:57.024]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:21:57.404 --> 02:22:01.926]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:22:01.986 --> 02:22:13.312]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul tastes and odors are separated from the water.
[02:22:13.912 --> 02:22:20.753]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:22:21.153 --> 02:22:23.294]  Your purified water is now ready!
[02:22:23.774 --> 02:22:28.755]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[02:22:29.055 --> 02:22:36.336]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:23:42.955 --> 02:23:43.736]  Bookmark it today.
[02:23:50.163 --> 02:23:52.084]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:23:52.564 --> 02:23:55.385]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:23:56.405 --> 02:24:01.967]  Vince in Indiana, Diane in South Carolina, Bill in Texas, Ron in Oklahoma, Eric in Connecticut, others.
[02:24:02.647 --> 02:24:03.528]  Your calls are coming up.
[02:24:03.548 --> 02:24:05.268]  We're gonna have Paul Watson with us as well.
[02:24:05.288 --> 02:24:09.310]  We'll talk about immigration in England and some of the Princess Diana murder by their government.
[02:24:10.270 --> 02:24:11.451]  And some other key stuff here.
[02:24:11.551 --> 02:24:14.252]  Jam-packed final 35 minutes we got left here.
[02:24:15.172 --> 02:24:18.293]  It's 24 minutes out of the hour right now on this Friday edition.
[02:24:19.461 --> 02:24:25.864]  Keith Parker, you're going to ride shotgun with us for the rest of the show if you can, but people are angry.
[02:24:25.884 --> 02:24:35.268]  They're finally waking up to Bush, but I'm watching neocons on radio kind of go, well, it isn't good, but he has to do it for politics, and it's what Hispanics want.
[02:24:35.848 --> 02:24:36.808]  I've got the polls.
[02:24:36.948 --> 02:24:37.929]  I've got the new polls.
[02:24:38.309 --> 02:24:40.730]  Hispanic Americans aren't for open borders.
[02:24:41.150 --> 02:24:42.190]  They're not stupid either.
[02:24:42.230 --> 02:24:43.531]  They know it destroys their jobs.
[02:24:44.299 --> 02:24:46.901]  But look at this masterful spin they do.
[02:24:47.622 --> 02:24:51.424]  Some people will hear that and think, oh gosh, this is a racial issue.
[02:24:51.444 --> 02:24:53.105]  I better shut up about it.
[02:24:53.406 --> 02:24:56.227]  We cannot allow that chilling effect to take place.
[02:24:56.247 --> 02:24:59.049]  Do you agree with that, Keith?
[02:24:59.370 --> 02:25:00.651]  Yes, I certainly do, Alex.
[02:25:00.711 --> 02:25:09.837]  There are people, particularly on the open borders side of the issue, people who want the borders open, that want nothing more than to make this a racial issue.
[02:25:10.768 --> 02:25:12.749]  However, the fact of the matter is this.
[02:25:12.949 --> 02:25:19.431]  It's an American issue, and not a racial issue, because it affects everyone, regardless of their color, their religion, or their political creed.
[02:25:19.651 --> 02:25:28.874]  But when Bush says he's doing this for Hispanic voters, that's like telling somebody you're giving them a disease, and here, I'm doing this because I care about you.
[02:25:29.494 --> 02:25:30.955]  Folks shouldn't take that as a gift.
[02:25:31.195 --> 02:25:33.576]  Beware the Trojan horse he's giving you.
[02:25:34.416 --> 02:25:35.717]  And it's so obvious.
[02:25:35.737 --> 02:25:42.399]  This is because the elite wants to drive down wages, bring in an uneducated mob to vote for gun control.
[02:25:42.819 --> 02:25:52.222]  Yes, in fact, Alex, black people and Hispanic people arguably are hurt more by immigration than are white people.
[02:25:52.322 --> 02:25:56.143]  And a lot of it has to do with the economic circumstances that they find themselves in.
[02:25:56.673 --> 02:26:01.038]  Yes, because everyone knows that when you have a surplus of any commodity, and labor is a commodity,
[02:26:19.764 --> 02:26:23.229]  That the price of it is going to go down because it becomes as common as dirt.
[02:26:23.329 --> 02:26:24.010]  It's everywhere.
[02:26:24.250 --> 02:26:27.434]  You can get it whenever you want and get however much of it you want.
[02:26:27.454 --> 02:26:30.438]  So, of course, wages are going to fall.
[02:26:30.578 --> 02:26:33.182]  And that's what this is all about, at least in part.
[02:26:33.886 --> 02:26:37.887]  Of course, it's about destroying sovereignty and further balkanization of our country.
[02:26:38.168 --> 02:26:38.488]  That's it.
[02:26:38.528 --> 02:26:39.308]  Let's take some calls.
[02:26:39.688 --> 02:26:41.169]  Vincent, Indiana, you're on the air.
[02:26:41.209 --> 02:26:41.669]  Go ahead.
[02:26:42.189 --> 02:26:46.030]  Gentlemen, I just had a few comments about our economic situation here.
[02:26:46.050 --> 02:26:51.232]  I think our economic policy is just so arrogant and it's delusional and it's moronic.
[02:26:51.372 --> 02:26:52.212]  Well, it's looting.
[02:26:52.272 --> 02:26:53.613]  The globalists are looting us.
[02:26:54.612 --> 02:26:55.013]  The U.S.
[02:26:55.053 --> 02:26:56.234]  dollar is falling in value.
[02:26:56.274 --> 02:26:57.715]  It's going to be toilet paper soon.
[02:26:58.035 --> 02:27:00.997]  We have the twin deficits, the trade deficit, the budget deficit.
[02:27:01.758 --> 02:27:04.900]  We've got the social security insolvency.
[02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:06.762]  And a lot of that is the illegal aliens.
[02:27:06.822 --> 02:27:10.825]  California is bankrupt due to the $30 billion shortfall.
[02:27:11.806 --> 02:27:14.188]  The illegal numbers are bigger than that in cost.
[02:27:14.888 --> 02:27:15.308]  That's true.
[02:27:15.929 --> 02:27:16.389]  It's a mess.
[02:27:16.429 --> 02:27:22.474]  The only thing, California, the reason they have to address their problems right now is because they can't print dollar bills.
[02:27:22.534 --> 02:27:23.535]  They can't print money.
[02:27:24.432 --> 02:27:27.575]  They have to address their issue, but we just seem to print this money.
[02:27:28.296 --> 02:27:31.579]  The United States is consuming all the savings of the world.
[02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:33.201]  It's ridiculous.
[02:27:33.241 --> 02:27:34.542]  I just don't see how this is going to end.
[02:27:34.602 --> 02:27:45.412]  I think what's going to happen is that the next planned terrorist action is going to precipitate a financial accident that's going to be quite severe.
[02:27:47.855 --> 02:27:48.896]  What's your insight into that?
[02:27:49.799 --> 02:27:50.379]  Absolutely.
[02:27:50.700 --> 02:27:52.240]  Look at what they do in third world countries.
[02:27:52.340 --> 02:27:55.862]  Dictators will plunge the economy so they can consolidate.
[02:27:56.282 --> 02:28:01.905]  The IMF documents say they want to cause depressions to get a police state in place.
[02:28:02.405 --> 02:28:07.007]  That's the official World Bank secret documents from two years ago that they admit are accurate and real.
[02:28:07.627 --> 02:28:08.408]  Keith, comments?
[02:28:09.688 --> 02:28:12.870]  Well, that pretty much sums it up in a nutshell, Alex.
[02:28:14.056 --> 02:28:18.700]  Obviously, the more chaos you can create, the more opportunity you can create.
[02:28:18.820 --> 02:28:36.854]  And as I mentioned before in regards to balkanization and creating our own Palestinian problem, if you have a large population of people within your country who don't feel any particular affinity to that country other than perhaps an economic one, then they can be easily exploited and manipulated
[02:28:37.273 --> 02:28:43.635]  Particularly when they have a low educational level, as do the majority of illegal immigrants in this country.
[02:28:43.675 --> 02:28:58.978]  They can be pandered to by, if not George Bush, then by Sante Fox, or perhaps a Democratic candidate, and manipulated into believing certain things which are advantageous for those in power.
[02:28:59.339 --> 02:29:04.680]  We've seen it before in a lot of other countries across the globe, and we're seeing it here now.
[02:29:06.125 --> 02:29:06.746]  Absolutely.
[02:29:07.026 --> 02:29:08.366]  Good points, Vince.
[02:29:08.407 --> 02:29:11.768]  We'll come back and talk to Diane, Bill, Ron, Eric, and others.
[02:29:11.849 --> 02:29:13.730]  And we'll have Paul Watson on with us, my good buddy.
[02:29:14.110 --> 02:29:19.413]  Webmasterofprisonplanet.com, my premier website, along with Infowars.com that my wife runs.
[02:29:20.093 --> 02:29:24.476]  And he'll be here to talk about what immigration's done to England and some other news.
[02:29:24.536 --> 02:29:26.937]  And we'll have Keith Parker on with us as well.
[02:29:27.598 --> 02:29:28.438]  So stay with us.
[02:29:28.598 --> 02:29:30.820]  A lot more in the final two segments.
[02:29:31.240 --> 02:29:31.860]  Stay with us.
[02:29:32.080 --> 02:29:32.821]  Stay the course.
[02:29:34.739 --> 02:29:37.743]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:38.664 --> 02:29:41.347]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:44.983 --> 02:29:46.344]  Hey Doris, great news!
[02:29:46.584 --> 02:29:50.828]  I now own my own home, free and clear, and I did it in less than five months.
[02:29:50.948 --> 02:29:52.269]  Did you receive an inheritance?
[02:29:52.469 --> 02:29:52.950]  Well, no.
[02:29:53.110 --> 02:29:57.814]  Actually, I found a way to eliminate my mortgage without bankruptcy and without the need of going to court.
[02:29:57.934 --> 02:30:01.197]  And you too can do this legally, lawfully, ethically, and morally.
[02:30:01.297 --> 02:30:03.719]  But Jim, I signed a note promising to pay back the loan.
[02:30:03.839 --> 02:30:05.841]  Isn't it wrong even if I could discharge the loan?
[02:30:06.081 --> 02:30:10.924]  Doris, I felt the same way until I took the time to learn the truth about money and banking.
[02:30:11.064 --> 02:30:14.926]  The most shocking thing I learned is the fact that no real money is ever loaned out.
[02:30:15.066 --> 02:30:17.768]  There's a dirty secret that the banks don't want you to know.
[02:30:17.928 --> 02:30:21.530]  And this is the basis of how I was able to discharge my own mortgage.
[02:30:21.710 --> 02:30:24.632]  I know this is hard to believe, but go to the website to learn more.
[02:30:24.772 --> 02:30:32.136]  Doris, get your pin and find out how many Americans are finding financial freedom by having their mortgages eliminated in less than five months.
[02:30:32.356 --> 02:30:36.978]  Go to www.eliminatemortgages.com slash liberty.
[02:30:37.098 --> 02:30:39.520]  Just the way it sounds and there's an S after mortgage.
[02:30:39.720 --> 02:30:44.402]  It's www.eliminatemortgages.com slash liberty.
[02:30:46.758 --> 02:30:47.278]  Late summer 2003.
[02:30:47.698 --> 02:30:51.779]  Mainstream press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[02:30:52.180 --> 02:30:52.700]  Late summer 2002?
[02:30:53.320 --> 02:30:54.920]  I heard the same thing.
[02:30:55.360 --> 02:30:56.801]  Late summer 2001?
[02:30:57.141 --> 02:30:58.241]  You heard the same thing.
[02:30:58.601 --> 02:31:05.743]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average currently trading in a 93 to 9400 range is down 7% from two years ago.
[02:31:06.264 --> 02:31:07.144]  That's recovery?
[02:31:07.764 --> 02:31:12.965]  Gold, now trading in the $360 range, is up 31% in that same period.
[02:31:13.366 --> 02:31:14.906]  Where do you want your hard-earned money?
[02:31:15.600 --> 02:31:18.342]  Hi folks, this is Jack Brown with Midas Resources.

[02:32:07.373 --> 02:32:09.093]  If you're a smoker, we have great rates for you too.
[02:32:09.113 --> 02:32:09.994]  Call Term Busters now.

[02:32:10.134 --> 02:32:13.654]  We specialize in term life insurance policies of a half million dollars or more.
[02:32:29.458 --> 02:32:34.902]  Remember, one million dollars in term life insurance coverage for as little as three dollars a day.
[02:32:35.022 --> 02:32:36.183]  Call right now.
[02:32:36.463 --> 02:32:38.184]  Operators are standing by.
[02:32:38.204 --> 02:32:38.244]  800-430-6692.
[02:32:38.264 --> 02:32:38.464]  800-430-6692.
[02:32:38.524 --> 02:32:43.848]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:32:43.868 --> 02:32:48.130]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:14.068 --> 02:33:21.311]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here back live and you know that we're on ABC Clear Channel feeds.
[02:33:21.531 --> 02:33:28.233]  That is, they're the big digital establishment birds and we lease time on one of Clear Channel's feeds.
[02:33:28.873 --> 02:33:32.634]  We lease time with ABC News out of New York.
[02:33:33.015 --> 02:33:36.776]  We have those great digital feeds for our stations and those
[02:33:38.192 --> 02:33:40.833]  Those details are at GCNlive.com.
[02:33:40.853 --> 02:33:42.994]  We're also on an old analog satellite.
[02:33:43.014 --> 02:33:45.995]  A lot of home listeners, a lot of stations pick us up off that.
[02:33:46.835 --> 02:33:48.576]  Galaxy 1 during the day.
[02:33:49.476 --> 02:33:51.157]  But at night, I'm only on Galaxy 9.
[02:33:52.637 --> 02:33:56.879]  And that satellite is going all digital in about three hours.
[02:33:58.279 --> 02:34:01.380]  So, we've talked to stations about this.
[02:34:01.620 --> 02:34:03.001]  Most stations have made changes.
[02:34:03.641 --> 02:34:06.822]  I'll have an announcement for you in the final segment with more details.
[02:34:07.974 --> 02:34:14.937]  As this all comes down to the wire, we have a new satellite, but they're making the connections and the uplinks today.
[02:34:14.957 --> 02:34:17.198]  That's how this stuff works.
[02:34:18.378 --> 02:34:22.920]  So, later I'll probably give a number out if you need to call to get an audio coupler.
[02:34:23.240 --> 02:34:28.002]  That's an increased quality phone line for today or tomorrow if you need it.
[02:34:28.263 --> 02:34:32.184]  But I'll give you an announcement here in the final segment on that.
[02:34:32.264 --> 02:34:36.566]  But GCNlive.com for the other satellite frequencies, they're all right there for you.
[02:34:37.236 --> 02:34:41.098]  Okay, there is so much to go over.
[02:34:42.158 --> 02:34:43.439]  Mark, do we have Paul Watson?
[02:34:45.980 --> 02:34:54.663]  Great, we're going to get Paul Joseph Watson on the line to talk about what they've done to England with the open borders and how it made the crime rate explode.
[02:34:54.683 --> 02:35:06.108]  Then they used the fear from the crime rate exploding to, because the British weren't very well known for being criminals, common street thugs, but now they've got plenty of it.
[02:35:06.698 --> 02:35:08.719]  Not with the drugs of every nation you can imagine.
[02:35:09.660 --> 02:35:10.620]  There, we'll go over that.
[02:35:11.160 --> 02:35:15.283]  You know, Keith Parker, this is a global model, isn't it?
[02:35:16.263 --> 02:35:16.623]  It is.
[02:35:17.104 --> 02:35:21.886]  It is applied to countries in Europe, as well as to countries here.
[02:35:22.106 --> 02:35:32.752]  And there has been a huge backlash against this in Europe, as we've seen through the candidacies and the successes of people like Jean-Marie Le Pen,
[02:35:33.611 --> 02:35:35.853]  Yorg Haider and others there.
[02:35:35.893 --> 02:35:42.997]  Of course, they're all portrayed as fascists because they're unwilling to go along in lockstep with the New World Order.
[02:35:43.617 --> 02:35:53.464]  But, as far as I can tell, they represent people whose voices have not been heard in regards to what immigration is doing to their country.
[02:35:53.604 --> 02:36:02.169]  And it's a little bit more difficult, I think, on the Europeans in some ways than it is on us, because their populations were, for the most part, largely
[02:36:02.842 --> 02:36:03.503]  I don't think so.
[02:36:15.490 --> 02:36:18.831]  Accepting anyone who is not from their culture.
[02:36:19.131 --> 02:36:20.832]  And also, there's really no debate.
[02:36:20.892 --> 02:36:23.353]  That really is their land, their countries.
[02:36:23.593 --> 02:36:26.474]  But these foreigners are coming in and saying, no, no, no, it's ours.
[02:36:26.814 --> 02:36:28.494]  They've got their racial identity.
[02:36:28.754 --> 02:36:29.715]  That's okay.
[02:36:29.935 --> 02:36:34.036]  But then the people who are originally from the country aren't supposed to have their identities.
[02:36:34.616 --> 02:36:35.437]  Think about that.
[02:36:35.917 --> 02:36:39.498]  Let's bring Paul Joseph Watson up, who lives in a town right outside London.
[02:36:40.720 --> 02:36:46.444]  To talk about what's happened, what the effects of illegal immigration and legal immigration have been in England.
[02:36:46.484 --> 02:36:47.745]  Paul, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:36:48.225 --> 02:36:49.066]  Always a pleasure, Alex.
[02:36:50.687 --> 02:36:52.408]  What's it been like for England?
[02:36:52.428 --> 02:36:54.049]  I know it's made your crime rate explode.
[02:36:54.089 --> 02:36:56.691]  They then used the pressure from that to oppress the people.
[02:36:57.131 --> 02:37:02.475]  And I know your polls show that the majority of the British people are against your open borders.
[02:37:02.495 --> 02:37:04.076]  But the government says, we don't care.
[02:37:04.356 --> 02:37:05.456]  Have some more illegals.
[02:37:05.497 --> 02:37:06.117]  Tell us about it.
[02:37:06.641 --> 02:37:07.422]  Well, yeah, this is the thing.
[02:37:07.462 --> 02:37:15.046]  I mean, Tony Blair's immigration policy, you know, Tony Blair, the admitted socialist, exactly mirrors what George Bush is proposing now.
[02:37:15.527 --> 02:37:24.272]  I mean, the Labour government came out about a year ago now and said the same thing, that more immigration would supposedly boost the UK economy.
[02:37:24.332 --> 02:37:27.694]  So they went ahead and legalised all the illegals.
[02:37:28.235 --> 02:37:30.136]  And what was the result?
[02:37:30.156 --> 02:37:31.497]  Well, the economy got worse.
[02:37:31.737 --> 02:37:33.298]  Taxes skyrocketed.
[02:37:33.988 --> 02:37:36.450]  And, as you said, crime, sword and men.
[02:37:36.470 --> 02:37:44.357]  Yeah, they all go on welfare, that's why the stock market, the taxes have to be raised because the deficit goes up.
[02:37:44.957 --> 02:37:48.260]  Yeah, I mean, the welfare state in this country is already out of control anyway.
[02:37:48.680 --> 02:37:57.688]  But then, the Home Secretary, David Blunkett, comes out and tells us to take a national ID card to fight illegal immigration.
[02:37:57.748 --> 02:37:58.148]  So again,
[02:37:58.703 --> 02:38:04.445]  They create the problem and then offer the solution, which in every instance is more police state.
[02:38:06.086 --> 02:38:06.926]  It's amazing.
[02:38:08.007 --> 02:38:09.648]  Let's take a few calls here.
[02:38:09.688 --> 02:38:12.529]  Let's talk to Diane in South Carolina.
[02:38:12.569 --> 02:38:13.869]  Diane, thanks for holding patiently.
[02:38:13.889 --> 02:38:14.490]  You're on the air.
[02:38:16.430 --> 02:38:17.591]  Good to talk to you, Diane.
[02:38:19.534 --> 02:38:20.174]  Hello, Alex.
[02:38:20.575 --> 02:38:21.575]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:38:21.655 --> 02:38:23.176]  I'm Elizabeth from Maryland.
[02:38:23.236 --> 02:38:24.436]  I think there was a little goof up.
[02:38:24.476 --> 02:38:25.337]  I never heard a name.
[02:38:25.957 --> 02:38:29.019]  Okay, well, Diane probably hung up and you probably got back in there.
[02:38:29.039 --> 02:38:29.439]  Go ahead.
[02:38:29.579 --> 02:38:30.099]  Thank you.
[02:38:31.300 --> 02:38:44.246]  I really appreciated something that today your show had a meeting of the greatest minds and good consciences and you really didn't fit Zephaniah 3 with prophets, light, and treacherous persons.
[02:38:45.006 --> 02:38:48.048]  And I was kind of disturbed this morning, like a lot.
[02:38:49.393 --> 02:39:01.643]  I heard John Loeffler on the Power Hour talking about in Nazi Germany that there were 14,000 clergy, and out of that only 4,000 stood up against the coming things of Hitler.
[02:39:02.204 --> 02:39:04.486]  And then guess who came on after him?
[02:39:04.866 --> 02:39:05.787]  Hal Lindsey!
[02:39:06.468 --> 02:39:14.715]  And Hal Lindsey said that nobody but the Al-Qaeda was involved in 9-1-1, and there was no depleted uranium.
[02:39:14.755 --> 02:39:15.656]  How about that, Alex?
[02:39:16.321 --> 02:39:19.704]  Oh, so our government's not using depleted uranium in Iraq?
[02:39:19.884 --> 02:39:20.204]  Yeah.
[02:39:20.785 --> 02:39:23.126]  He actually said there's no depleted uranium.
[02:39:23.206 --> 02:39:30.252]  Right, and then he went on, when they tried to clarify it for him, he said, well, if there is a problem like that, we should clean it up.
[02:39:30.712 --> 02:39:33.694]  Well, then Joyce and Dave pointed out, you can't clean it up.
[02:39:34.535 --> 02:39:36.376]  So, you know, I felt rather disheartened.
[02:39:36.656 --> 02:39:43.882]  Years ago, my husband bought all these books, all these prophetic books, and I think the time is coming that we as Christians
[02:39:44.286 --> 02:39:50.349]  We have to use our sanity and our common sense to see who are the wolves and who are the sheep.
[02:39:50.709 --> 02:39:58.393]  And I appreciate that your program had minds like Joel Skousen and like Keith Parker and like Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:39:58.734 --> 02:40:02.656]  People that I believe are telling the truth, Alex, along with you.
[02:40:02.676 --> 02:40:05.137]  Wow, well thank you so much for that call.
[02:40:05.177 --> 02:40:05.717]  God bless.
[02:40:05.977 --> 02:40:07.058]  You too.
[02:40:07.178 --> 02:40:08.679]  Paul Watson, Keith Parker.
[02:40:09.480 --> 02:40:12.501]  We have these neocon people, and I've even got Hal Lindsey books.
[02:40:12.782 --> 02:40:18.964]  I mean, he's good on exposing the Satanists, he's good on talking about globalism, but then he'll tell you George Bush is good.
[02:40:18.984 --> 02:40:21.445]  It's like Limbaugh telling us Bush is good.
[02:40:21.465 --> 02:40:24.867]  I mean, that's where the sleight of hand takes place.
[02:40:25.827 --> 02:40:26.568]  Comments to that?
[02:40:27.528 --> 02:40:31.030]  Well, it's very clever, Alex, and not so subtle.
[02:40:32.670 --> 02:40:35.952]  You have to remember that a great many Americans are
[02:40:36.510 --> 02:40:40.372]  They're frightened by a lot of the problems that confront this country, and they don't really know where to turn.
[02:40:41.172 --> 02:40:53.057]  And if someone is propped up who appears to be a stalwart, honest, powerful leader figure, then they'll latch on to it.
[02:40:53.838 --> 02:40:58.020]  Because, sadly, a lot of Americans, I'm afraid, don't possess the power for critical thinking.
[02:40:59.300 --> 02:41:03.262]  And you have to consider, too, the role that immigration plays in this.
[02:41:03.652 --> 02:41:07.193]  People are out there working, as I said before, 60-70 hours a week.
[02:41:07.633 --> 02:41:08.994]  They've got kids to raise.
[02:41:09.894 --> 02:41:13.055]  By the time they get home at the end of the week, their heads are spinning.
[02:41:13.075 --> 02:41:14.216]  They can't think straight.
[02:41:15.196 --> 02:41:19.458]  And some of them never have the time or the opportunity to sort these issues out.
[02:41:19.478 --> 02:41:22.058]  A lot of people these days don't even know who the hell they are.
[02:41:23.239 --> 02:41:31.922]  So, when you take these facts into account, it becomes at least somewhat more easy to understand how the neocons
[02:41:32.338 --> 02:41:43.088]  And their liberal cohorts are able to mislead people into thinking that those who rule over us from Washington are actually doing what's best for our people and our nation.
[02:41:43.468 --> 02:41:51.216]  Hey, Paul, you got any comments on the neocon preachers telling us that God's will is to attack all these sovereign countries?
[02:41:51.849 --> 02:41:57.210]  Well, yeah, I heard part of the interview that the caller referred to, and I mean, this is the thing, the neocon infestation of the country.
[02:41:57.650 --> 02:42:05.851]  And, I mean, what is just as shocking as Bush legalising all the illegals is how these neocons have responded to it in the conservative media.
[02:42:05.871 --> 02:42:09.972]  I mean, go to World Net Daily and Newsmax right now, what's the top headline?
[02:42:10.452 --> 02:42:15.453]  It's Howard Dean said in 1996 that Hamas should take over from Yasser Arafat.
[02:42:15.473 --> 02:42:17.753]  You know, Wesley Clark is pro-abortion.
[02:42:17.794 --> 02:42:18.574]  Well, we know all this.
[02:42:18.614 --> 02:42:20.554]  We already know that the Democrats are criminals.
[02:42:21.075 --> 02:42:28.798]  Who cares when Bush and his bosses are basically splitting the throat of the country as we speak, and the neocons just won't face up to it.
[02:42:30.519 --> 02:42:32.239]  Wow, that was well said, Paul.
[02:42:33.360 --> 02:42:34.360]  Absolutely, Keith.
[02:42:35.501 --> 02:42:36.201]  I agree with him.
[02:42:36.801 --> 02:42:48.606]  I mean, hypocrisy is mind-bending, and I hesitate to use the word hypocrisy because somehow I think we need to come up with a stronger word to describe the action
[02:42:49.449 --> 02:42:50.230]  Of all of these people.
[02:42:50.250 --> 02:42:53.932]  Perhaps hyper, hyper treachery, hyper hypocrisy.
[02:42:55.133 --> 02:42:56.514]  Yes, whatever you please.
[02:42:57.094 --> 02:43:02.257]  But they've taken the whole thing to completely and totally new levels.
[02:43:02.417 --> 02:43:03.658]  Actually, hype isn't enough.
[02:43:03.878 --> 02:43:05.059]  Warp hypocrisy.
[02:43:05.139 --> 02:43:08.161]  Warp 10, speed of light hypocrisy.
[02:43:08.241 --> 02:43:09.282]  Yes, it's like an onion.
[02:43:09.402 --> 02:43:11.443]  Thermonuclear hypocrisy.
[02:43:11.683 --> 02:43:11.964]  Right.
[02:43:11.984 --> 02:43:13.925]  I mean, peel away one layer and there's a lie.
[02:43:13.985 --> 02:43:15.866]  Peel that one away and there's another lie.
[02:43:15.926 --> 02:43:18.728]  And it goes on, seemingly, forever.
[02:43:19.767 --> 02:43:21.548]  And they seem to have no moral center.
[02:43:22.708 --> 02:43:24.409]  They're complete and total pragmatists.
[02:43:24.429 --> 02:43:28.211]  Well, they also get caught lying about everything, and then no one's ever punished for it.
[02:43:28.731 --> 02:43:33.574]  Well, no, of course not, because after all, the people that ought to do the punishing are all bought and paid for.
[02:43:33.614 --> 02:43:36.895]  There is no longer any system of checks and balances.
[02:43:37.055 --> 02:43:39.997]  They're there in name only.
[02:43:40.317 --> 02:43:41.917]  I tell you, it was humiliating, Keith.
[02:43:41.937 --> 02:43:45.019]  You were there standing beside me when Fox drove by
[02:43:45.899 --> 02:43:57.479]  Our little protest we just started in about a day but it was about 50-60 folks and he pulls by into the governor's mansion, looks at us with total hate, jumps over his wife in the back of the limo, leans his head out,
[02:43:58.465 --> 02:44:09.251]  Looks at us like a vampire or something, and then to have him giving awards to the city and people for selling out our sovereignty and not following the laws.
[02:44:09.351 --> 02:44:16.955]  I mean, I was watching an enemy spy out in the open paying off our gatekeepers to lower the drawbridge.
[02:44:17.316 --> 02:44:23.179]  Well, Alex, everything you do comes back to you, whether you're regular Joes like us or you happen to be a head of state.
[02:44:24.153 --> 02:44:27.997]  Everything you do, good or bad, comes back around, and there is no escaping that.
[02:44:28.237 --> 02:44:34.082]  Well, it came back around when he got to the back of the building and I shut down his speech with my bullhorn.
[02:44:34.943 --> 02:44:40.529]  Well, that's true, but I'm thinking in more, I suppose, cosmic terms.
[02:44:40.809 --> 02:44:42.030]  Yeah, final terms.
[02:44:42.070 --> 02:44:43.711]  Yes, exactly.
[02:44:44.152 --> 02:44:45.093]  Paul, comments to that?
[02:44:45.113 --> 02:44:46.154]  Then I'm going to go to some more calls.
[02:44:46.832 --> 02:44:48.834]  Well, it goes back to the whole neocon thing.
[02:44:48.874 --> 02:44:53.698]  I mean, they have the same response to every socialist action that Bush runs through.
[02:44:53.758 --> 02:45:14.456]  I mean, we've got the massive budget, the Medicare, the Medicaid, the biggest expansion of government ever, the selling out of Taiwan, the assault weapons ban, even down to blocking the arming of pilots, you know, kissing up to Putin, signing away the hundreds of millions of dollars to North Korea to build their nuclear reactors, and the neocon
[02:45:15.275 --> 02:45:18.137]  And that's the key word is MASSIVE ACCELERATION!
[02:45:18.337 --> 02:45:20.799]  Let's talk to Bill in Texas, then Ron, Eric, and others.
[02:45:20.919 --> 02:45:21.780]  Go ahead, Bill.
[02:45:47.509 --> 02:45:49.731]  I think we might have gotten the calls scrambled a bit here.
[02:45:50.452 --> 02:45:51.212]  Bill, are you there?
[02:45:55.155 --> 02:45:56.256]  We'll go to Bill.
[02:45:56.457 --> 02:45:58.979]  I said we'll go to Bill, then we'll go to Ron, then we'll go to Eric.
[02:45:59.279 --> 02:46:00.140]  Bill, go ahead.
[02:46:01.861 --> 02:46:03.002]  Yeah, Alex, this isn't Bill.
[02:46:03.643 --> 02:46:04.203]  Okay, fine.
[02:46:04.223 --> 02:46:04.543]  You know what?
[02:46:04.583 --> 02:46:05.524]  I'll just go to calls.
[02:46:05.564 --> 02:46:07.646]  Just say what your name is and where you're calling from.
[02:46:08.106 --> 02:46:08.687]  What's your name?
[02:46:08.707 --> 02:46:09.528]  Where are you calling from?
[02:46:09.688 --> 02:46:10.248]  Hi, Alex.
[02:46:10.268 --> 02:46:11.449]  This is Mike from Rhode Island.
[02:46:11.469 --> 02:46:11.790]  How are you?
[02:46:12.190 --> 02:46:12.630]  Fine, sir.
[02:46:13.051 --> 02:46:14.532]  How are you, Paul?
[02:46:16.212 --> 02:46:26.858]  I can't remember the other guy's name, but Alex, real quick, I just wanted to echo what that lady you called a caller to ago about Joyce and Dave's program with Hal Lindsey.
[02:46:28.519 --> 02:46:40.986]  I heard that program and they were very respectful of Mr. Lindsey and his books and I've read them too and all that, but I'll tell you, that's the ultimate deception and I think it's people like
[02:46:42.138 --> 02:46:49.220]  He may have it right biblically, and he may have it right on some of these prophecies he's been writing about, but he'll get on there.
[02:46:49.260 --> 02:47:04.625]  He has a platform, he has a name, and then when they confront him about these things about Iraq and what's going on with Israel and all this stuff, he stands there and he says, oh no, the Muslims, they're evil, the fanatic Muslims, it's all their fault.
[02:47:04.645 --> 02:47:06.305]  You know what I'm saying, Alex?
[02:47:07.346 --> 02:47:08.586]  Oh yeah, they're the boogeyman.
[02:47:10.526 --> 02:47:14.028]  And they influence a lot of Christians, and that's why a lot of Christians are deceived.
[02:47:14.088 --> 02:47:18.890]  And I just thank God, you know, that for shows like you and Joyce and Dave that are out there.
[02:47:19.470 --> 02:47:23.012]  And if you listen to the tone, you know, Hal's voice, I mean, he was incredulous.
[02:47:23.612 --> 02:47:28.034]  He said, he said to Joyce and Dave, where are you getting your information?
[02:47:29.955 --> 02:47:32.216]  Like, how dare you, you know, confront me with this?
[02:47:32.256 --> 02:47:33.276]  This, this is not right.
[02:47:33.737 --> 02:47:38.779]  And I, you know, I, I just, I can see through the lies, Alex, and I know a lot of your listeners can, and, uh,
[02:47:39.437 --> 02:47:42.578]  We're waking up and just keep the info war going, brother.
[02:47:42.598 --> 02:47:42.918]  All right.
[02:47:42.978 --> 02:47:43.559]  Thanks a lot.
[02:47:43.619 --> 02:47:46.160]  I appreciate that call.
[02:47:46.180 --> 02:47:49.181]  I want to know what's really going to happen in prophecy.
[02:47:49.661 --> 02:47:53.703]  Pastor David J. Smith or Tex Mars, folks like that.
[02:47:54.603 --> 02:47:56.004]  Let's go ahead and
[02:47:57.580 --> 02:47:59.461]  Well, I wonder who I should go to next.
[02:48:00.141 --> 02:48:01.681]  I guess Ron in Oklahoma's next.
[02:48:02.281 --> 02:48:06.343]  Ron in Oklahoma, then we'll go to Bill and Alki in Hawaii.
[02:48:06.483 --> 02:48:07.483]  Ron, go ahead quickly.
[02:48:08.103 --> 02:48:08.963]  Quickly, Al.
[02:48:10.164 --> 02:48:15.926]  I have Paul Gorter out of chaos and Tech Bar's Circle of Entry.
[02:48:16.746 --> 02:48:20.847]  You're 9-11, make the conceivable, please stage 2 and 3, Masters of Terror, Tate.
[02:48:22.206 --> 02:48:26.789]  It's important for people to have this information, to be knowledgeable, to talk to other people about it.
[02:48:26.869 --> 02:48:28.629]  I've passed out quite a few of your tapes.
[02:48:29.230 --> 02:48:34.913]  They do make a difference, especially now that we've seen Bush going crazy, opening the borders.
[02:48:35.613 --> 02:48:38.875]  But I'm starting to get some good responses from people.
[02:48:38.895 --> 02:48:46.979]  But also, real quick, on tape 3D yesterday, January 8th, Daily Oklahoman, NewsOK.com,
[02:48:48.072 --> 02:48:48.472]  We're good.
[02:49:05.234 --> 02:49:10.236]  At CNN.com, Dobbs has been hammering really hard on Bush.
[02:49:10.256 --> 02:49:11.777]  That's because he knows it's popular.
[02:49:11.797 --> 02:49:13.077]  He knows it's the right thing to do.
[02:49:13.638 --> 02:49:14.638]  It'll get him ratings.
[02:49:14.738 --> 02:49:20.700]  But, yeah, as if there's more technology and funding in these third-world countries.
[02:49:21.301 --> 02:49:22.201]  This is so sick.
[02:49:22.281 --> 02:49:24.162]  Gentlemen, comments on the high-tech jobs?
[02:49:25.262 --> 02:49:32.945]  Well, Alex, you've talked many times about the H-1B visa program and the effect that it's had on a lot of businesses.
[02:49:35.006 --> 02:49:41.329]  As far as them getting rid of Americans and bringing in other people that will do the work for a lower amount of money.
[02:49:41.349 --> 02:49:46.572]  We've seen that right here where we live, in Austin, Texas, with companies like Dell and Motorola.
[02:49:47.012 --> 02:50:02.300]  I mean, corporate America and federal government are simply not satisfied with bringing in people illegally from across the border to drive the wage scale down, to take things like construction jobs and other positions.
[02:50:03.888 --> 02:50:08.810]  They're going great guns on pushing down the wages at the top of the scale.
[02:50:08.930 --> 02:50:17.794]  It's actually a very old tactic, one that was created a long time ago by Antonio Gramsci, an Italian communist.
[02:50:17.914 --> 02:50:26.859]  Pressure from above and pressure from below, and it leaves the working class Americans compressed in the middle, working their butts off for little or nothing.
[02:50:27.199 --> 02:50:27.659]  Absolutely.
[02:50:27.679 --> 02:50:32.041]  We'll come back and take two final calls and get final comments from Pete Parker, Paul Watson,
[02:50:32.984 --> 02:50:36.326]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com are the powerful websites.
[02:50:36.806 --> 02:50:40.509]  We'll come back and talk to Bill and then Alki in Hawaii.
[02:50:40.529 --> 02:50:42.390]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:42.410 --> 02:50:43.150]  Please stay with us.
[02:50:45.692 --> 02:50:50.014]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:50:50.214 --> 02:50:54.637]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:50:54.777 --> 02:50:59.160]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.

[02:51:51.227 --> 02:51:55.330]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:51:55.610 --> 02:51:56.170]  We listened.
[02:51:56.471 --> 02:52:01.454]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:52:01.735 --> 02:52:02.215]  We listened.
[02:52:02.595 --> 02:52:05.637]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:52:06.078 --> 02:52:06.618]  We listened.
[02:52:07.059 --> 02:52:10.221]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[02:52:10.441 --> 02:52:10.761]  I don't know.

[02:53:57.945 --> 02:53:59.766]  It's been a totally jam-packed show.
[02:54:00.759 --> 02:54:11.822]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time on your local AM or FM station or on Global Shortwave at 5.085 or 6890, that's the frequencies at night.
[02:54:12.842 --> 02:54:22.845]  And of course I'll be back Monday from 11 to 2 for the Daytime Show and I do a show with John Stapmiller from 1 to 4 on Real Talk Radio on the same network.
[02:54:24.206 --> 02:54:27.727]  Let us now go ahead and talk to
[02:54:29.188 --> 02:54:33.712]  Alki, I hope I'm pronouncing that right, from Hawaii, or Alki, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:54:33.732 --> 02:54:34.552]  Hello?
[02:54:34.992 --> 02:54:35.393]  Yes, sir.
[02:54:35.873 --> 02:54:37.354]  Oh, yeah, it's Alki.
[02:54:37.654 --> 02:54:38.255]  Okay, welcome.
[02:54:38.795 --> 02:54:44.359]  Yeah, first, when I was on hold, I was thinking about Hitler and Bush, right?
[02:54:45.080 --> 02:54:45.420]  Yes.
[02:54:45.820 --> 02:54:51.325]  Both of them, they like, they do bad things, but they're only following orders, right?
[02:54:53.626 --> 02:54:54.067]  Uh, yes.
[02:54:54.727 --> 02:54:57.069]  Yeah, and like, what the media's been able to do,
[02:54:57.705 --> 02:55:02.868]  Is they twist it, they make the masses focus on like Hitler or Bush, right?
[02:55:03.668 --> 02:55:05.709]  And not on the people giving the orders.
[02:55:06.670 --> 02:55:08.791]  That's just been, that's one thing I thought about.
[02:55:09.391 --> 02:55:18.956]  Yeah, we should be focusing more on the IMF, the World Bank, the Council on Foreign Relations, the big corporations that are funding and pushing all this.
[02:55:19.036 --> 02:55:19.697]  Paul Watson?
[02:55:20.357 --> 02:55:23.719]  Well yeah, I mean it's like in this country where people harp on about
[02:55:24.904 --> 02:55:26.825]  Tony Blair's a poodle of George Bush.
[02:55:26.845 --> 02:55:29.366]  Well, I point out that not really the case.
[02:55:29.486 --> 02:55:33.568]  Both Tony Blair and George Bush are poodles of the New World Order.
[02:55:33.608 --> 02:55:42.171]  I mean, you, Alex, said that even in the last few years of the Clinton administration, you just stopped focusing on Clinton and started focusing on the powers above him.
[02:55:42.191 --> 02:55:48.313]  So, that's what we need to do to expose the real criminal element that we've got pulling the strings behind the scenes.
[02:55:48.553 --> 02:55:49.094]  Yes, sir.
[02:55:49.194 --> 02:55:50.294]  Anything else from Hawaii?
[02:55:50.354 --> 02:55:51.094]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:55:51.135 --> 02:55:52.315]  What I was thinking about is, like,
[02:55:52.884 --> 02:55:54.785]  The people telling Bush what to do.
[02:55:55.905 --> 02:55:58.787]  They're not the top of the pyramid, no, right?
[02:55:59.847 --> 02:56:00.247]  Uh, no.
[02:56:03.109 --> 02:56:07.571]  So the people at the top of the pyramid, would you say they control Europe and America?
[02:56:08.191 --> 02:56:14.174]  Yeah, but there are some different power shifts and sub-directorates, but they all have the same goal, total domination.
[02:56:14.194 --> 02:56:14.914]  Thanks for the call.
[02:56:15.414 --> 02:56:18.996]  And I'm sorry to Bill in Texas and a bunch of other callers, that's it for calls today.
[02:56:19.956 --> 02:56:21.677]  Keith Parker, final comments real quick.
[02:56:22.475 --> 02:56:37.158]  Well, something that I'd like to leave all your listeners with, Alex, is that guys like you and me and all the guests that you have on, we can all impart good information, but in the end, we're nothing more than catalysts at the most.
[02:56:37.678 --> 02:56:41.038]  It's the people out there listening that actually do the work.
[02:56:41.698 --> 02:56:46.319]  The ones that go around to their friends and their families and say, hey, something's wrong.
[02:56:46.439 --> 02:56:47.259]  Things are not right.
[02:56:47.319 --> 02:56:50.560]  This is what's happening, and this is what we can do about it.
[02:56:51.132 --> 02:57:07.357]  In the end they're the ones who are going to provide solutions and I want to make sure they understand that even though the media in this nation and throughout the world works very very hard to create a pervasive sense of isolation and make them think
[02:57:07.955 --> 02:57:19.206]  That people who believe in the things that we talk about on these shows are nothing more than some kind of radical- We can break that hold, and we are going to break it for survival's sake.
[02:57:19.506 --> 02:57:21.047]  Paul, you have a good weekend.
[02:57:21.608 --> 02:57:22.689]  Keith, you have a great weekend.
[02:57:22.709 --> 02:57:25.011]  Gentlemen, to both of you, thanks for coming on.
[02:57:25.251 --> 02:57:25.832]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:57:26.873 --> 02:57:27.394]  Thanks Paul.
[02:57:27.734 --> 02:57:31.518]  Alright guys, I'm out of time and you talk about taking action.
