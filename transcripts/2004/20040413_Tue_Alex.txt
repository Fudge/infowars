[00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:05.756]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.417 --> 00:00:07.478]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:09.300]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.941 --> 00:00:10.762]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.522 --> 00:00:12.423]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.084 --> 00:00:16.788]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:21.353]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.706 --> 00:00:28.087]  Thank you for joining us on this 13th day of April 2004.
[00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:30.928]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:30.968 --> 00:00:33.809]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:50.155]  The websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:00:50.515 --> 00:01:00.262]  Paul Joseph Watson, who joins us at least once a week, the webmaster of my website, PrisonPlanet.com, will be joining us to go over the latest news and his analysis on those developments.
[00:01:00.282 --> 00:01:02.004]  We'll also have wide-open phones.
[00:01:02.044 --> 00:01:10.610]  We've got a bunch of other big guests lined up for later in the week as well, so you don't want to miss this broadcast week, what we've got left of it, in the next four days.
[00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:16.939]  78 troops killed this month in Iraq, and that's the government's numbers.
[00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:21.840]  Later they, unfortunately in every case in the last year, adjust them up.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.160]  There's never been an adjusting down, obviously.
[00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:27.841]  And hundreds and hundreds of wounded.
[00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.282]  Meanwhile, thousands of Iraqis killed.
[00:01:30.942 --> 00:01:33.082]  Iraqi clerics, militia retreats.
[00:01:33.442 --> 00:01:36.363]  Seizure of three cities ends ahead of U.S.
[00:01:36.403 --> 00:01:36.963]  offensives.
[00:01:37.583 --> 00:01:41.424]  And the followers of the radical cleric gave up their hold in three cities.
[00:01:42.142 --> 00:01:43.363]  Yesterday, as U.S.
[00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:58.313]  troops prepared to launch an offensive against them, easing a standoff that threatened to become a major battle, hundreds of men left police stations and government buildings that they had overtaken a week ago in the cities of Najaf, Karbala, and Kufa.
[00:01:59.204 --> 00:02:16.109]  Witnesses said the retreat appeared to end one of two fronts that erupted last week when followers of the radical cleric rose up in the south and the Sunnis loyal to the previous regime of Saddam Hussein launched attacks in Ramadi and Fallujah.
[00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.570]  In the Sunni triangle, dozens of U.S.
[00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.671]  troops and hundreds of Iraqis died in ensuing battles.
[00:02:22.151 --> 00:02:23.591]  Well, it's more than dozens of U.S.
[00:02:23.611 --> 00:02:25.712]  troops and it's thousands of Iraqis.
[00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:26.632]  And
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.482]  Convoys are still being attacked.
[00:02:30.542 --> 00:02:31.783]  Vehicles are still burning.
[00:02:32.103 --> 00:02:42.433]  The FBI is investigating a whole bunch of different kidnappings that have gone on.
[00:02:42.453 --> 00:02:52.302]  FBI probes about 40 abductions in Iraq, and that's new abductions the last four or five days, not counting the people that have been released, Russians, Chinese.
[00:02:53.423 --> 00:03:02.025]  You name it, and all those grisly images of people in black ski masks, the bad guys, the bad guys wear black ski masks, holding knives to people's throats.
[00:03:02.085 --> 00:03:06.587]  I thought it was my local police department over there, though, because of the uniform.
[00:03:06.607 --> 00:03:07.347]  I couldn't tell.
[00:03:07.367 --> 00:03:12.388]  I thought it was an authority and that I should submit to them because I thought the good guys wear black ski masks.
[00:03:12.428 --> 00:03:20.550]  But I have this old memory of bad guys wearing black ski masks, but I guess I've been wrong all along concerning this.
[00:03:21.031 --> 00:03:22.391]  John Ashcroft and Janet...
[00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.491]  Butcher of Waco, Reno.
[00:03:24.511 --> 00:03:26.753]  I've just gotten done testifying.
[00:03:28.535 --> 00:03:35.840]  And the media keeps saying, oh my goodness, they dropped the ball, this culture of not communicating between the FBI and the CIA.
[00:03:36.081 --> 00:03:36.621]  No, folks.
[00:03:37.702 --> 00:03:43.727]  Bush ordered the FBI not to stop al-Qaeda, to leave them alone, to end their investigations.
[00:03:43.827 --> 00:03:44.748]  That is admitted.
[00:03:45.668 --> 00:03:47.970]  And the media is complicit covering this up.
[00:03:48.391 --> 00:03:50.472]  One of the latest developments, Sybil Edmonds.
[00:03:50.712 --> 00:03:51.293]  Sybil Edmonds.
[00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:56.941]  The FBI translator gets the documents where they knew the attacks were going to take place.
[00:03:57.321 --> 00:03:59.322]  They tell her to go back and alter those documents.
[00:03:59.342 --> 00:04:00.243]  She says, no way.
[00:04:00.283 --> 00:04:03.424]  They threaten to arrest her or offer her a bigger job to do it.
[00:04:04.664 --> 00:04:13.308]  She tells the commission months ago they never go public with it, so she has a press conference with 15 news cameras, over 30 press reporters for major papers.
[00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:15.309]  Nothing in our news.
[00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:16.990]  It shows up on this show.
[00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.351]  Tom Flacco, World Net Daily writer,
[00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.451]  Puts it out on his website, tompluggo.com.
[00:04:22.731 --> 00:04:26.913]  It gets picked up by a few foreign papers and finally gets briefly mentioned on Meet the Press.
[00:04:26.953 --> 00:04:28.634]  So they can say, oh, we did cover it.
[00:04:30.115 --> 00:04:32.516]  Never in our papers and a bare mention on Meet the Press.
[00:04:32.756 --> 00:04:33.697]  That's a big deal.
[00:04:33.877 --> 00:04:37.759]  Saying, we'll arrest you if you don't falsify these documents that we have prior knowledge.
[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.481]  But again, the average person will never hear about it.
[00:04:42.842 --> 00:04:45.363]  You'll just hear about how evil Ted Kennedy and Hillary are.
[00:04:45.503 --> 00:04:47.124]  Yes, we know that, neocons.
[00:04:47.364 --> 00:04:49.445]  And we know you're working with them to destroy this country.
[00:04:50.307 --> 00:04:51.909]  But again, they create that false paradigm.
[00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:53.210]  So much news.
[00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.212]  Giant broadcast lined up for you.
[00:04:55.492 --> 00:04:56.293]  Please stay with us.
[00:04:56.874 --> 00:04:58.736]  Infowars.com, personplanet.com.

[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.165]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:05.345 --> 00:06:09.689]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.293]  To use this disaster is a new world order.
[00:06:14.393 --> 00:06:17.176]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:06:17.457 --> 00:06:21.701]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:21.761 --> 00:06:28.689]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.832]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:31.072 --> 00:06:41.516]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:41.796 --> 00:06:47.178]  If you want to understand what the new old order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:07:49.329 --> 00:07:50.030]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:08:00.555 --> 00:08:05.558]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:08.280]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:21.789 --> 00:08:26.412]  A lot of people have called into the show and they've said that the 9-11 Commission...
[00:08:28.396 --> 00:08:39.902]  This is a soft-soaping, white-washing, cover-up, kangaroo court creation of the Bush administration, which they admittedly are a creation, an appointment of the Bush administration.
[00:08:40.382 --> 00:08:42.503]  Well, then why are they even having it in the first place?
[00:08:44.764 --> 00:08:46.145]  Well, that's an important question.
[00:08:46.665 --> 00:08:56.450]  Now, we've gone over the evidence of Thomas Keene, the chairman, being in business with the Bin Ladens, and not just the Bin Laden family, but also some of Bin Laden's brother-in-law and
[00:08:58.467 --> 00:09:10.598]  You get into the head of the committee, that is the head staffer helping write Condoleezza Rice's book, working for the Bush administration, having to secretly testify before the commission because that individual was involved in some of the cover-ups of the evidence.
[00:09:11.679 --> 00:09:19.507]  Other members of the commission leaving and getting the chairmanships of major federal bodies like the Import-Export Bank,
[00:09:20.822 --> 00:09:25.684]  Just remember, they tried to appoint Henry Kissinger to be the first head of the so-called Independent Commission.
[00:09:26.004 --> 00:09:39.588]  Bush appoints his business partner, his partner in just dozens of public crimes that Bush and his daddy have been caught in over the last few decades, and nobody bought that across the political spectrum.
[00:09:39.608 --> 00:09:46.930]  Dr. Henry Kissinger is hated by conservatives and liberals alike, so they brought out lesser-known whitewashers, lesser-known business partners.
[00:09:48.112 --> 00:09:54.797]  So then you come back with, okay, we know he appointed the commission, we know it's a whitewash, but why even have the whitewash?
[00:09:54.857 --> 00:09:56.818]  Well, that's an important question, as I said.
[00:09:58.099 --> 00:10:00.541]  Because the people were calling for it.
[00:10:01.461 --> 00:10:12.169]  And it gives the illusion that there's some type of debate going on in Congress with the first congressional commission and some type of debate going on in Washington with the second commission.
[00:10:13.053 --> 00:10:27.838]  And so this is a place where everybody can have a false closure and where you can bring up the public officials and then throw them softball questions and basically have a fake trial and then absolve them of any wrongdoing.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.941]  I mean, every time they slap him on the wrist, they go, boy, Bill Clinton and George Bush really messed up.
[00:10:33.381 --> 00:10:36.162]  But I tell you what, we'll just give you more funds.
[00:10:36.602 --> 00:10:39.483]  The commission said day one that we're not looking for any fault.
[00:10:39.523 --> 00:10:41.563]  We just want to find out how to stop this.
[00:10:42.164 --> 00:10:53.267]  They said, we believe, this was a year ago when the commission first got set up, we believe that a domestic CIA has needed more funds for the government.
[00:10:54.027 --> 00:10:55.487]  Boy, that's real punishment.
[00:10:55.527 --> 00:10:58.148]  Give the government unconstitutional powers more funding.
[00:10:59.167 --> 00:11:01.108]  Which is what happens every time there's a terror attack.
[00:11:01.168 --> 00:11:02.188]  No one's held accountable.
[00:11:02.508 --> 00:11:03.368]  No one's punished.
[00:11:03.709 --> 00:11:09.430]  You know, in all the jobs I ever had, if I screwed something up, I'd get reprimanded, I'd get docked, or I'd get fired.
[00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:10.491]  You know, I've been fired before.
[00:11:13.132 --> 00:11:14.792]  And that's how it should work.
[00:11:14.912 --> 00:11:17.613]  But not in America with this new system.
[00:11:18.233 --> 00:11:24.335]  Something bad happens, the government lets something bad happen, or in this case, engineers it, and they get more funding.
[00:11:25.336 --> 00:11:28.097]  And nothing illustrates this better than Bush...
[00:11:29.781 --> 00:11:44.135]  Three days after 9-11, going to CIA headquarters, standing on the eagle, on the shield, there in the foyer, on the marble, where hundreds of CIA agents stand around him, clapping, smiling, celebrating.
[00:11:44.175 --> 00:11:45.256]  It went on for several minutes.
[00:11:45.976 --> 00:11:49.580]  I've got video of it, just clapping and smiling and laughing.
[00:11:50.961 --> 00:11:52.903]  It was such a great celebration.
[00:11:54.375 --> 00:11:58.465]  Just a standing ovation for Bush, and you know why he was getting a standing ovation.
[00:11:58.986 --> 00:12:00.289]  He announced big bonuses.
[00:12:00.329 --> 00:12:01.452]  He announced raises.
[00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:02.995]  He announced promotions.
[00:12:04.511 --> 00:12:22.126]  And it wasn't just in the CIA and the FBI, all of those, this has been in the news, this has been in the mainstream news, all of the people who blocked FBI agents and threatened to arrest them and came and grabbed case files from them and sent them letters saying you'll be arrested if you continue this investigation under W1999, they got $15,000 to $20,000 bonuses.
[00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:39.936]  In the consulates, in the State Department, in the CIA, in the FBI, and the people that blew the whistle that specifically said, plans to fly planes into buildings, look at this, we've got to stop them, they got demoted, they got threats to be arrested.
[00:12:42.777 --> 00:12:44.438]  And it's the same thing with Sybil Edmonds.
[00:12:44.498 --> 00:12:45.478]  I mean, she's just the latest.
[00:12:46.239 --> 00:12:48.580]  Three weeks ago, she goes, you know,
[00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:53.297]  Months ago, she went before the commission in secret in one of the closed sessions.
[00:12:53.337 --> 00:13:02.143]  Then, a few weeks ago, she goes out and says, Look, I told them months ago, and they were going to go public with it, but they haven't, that here's the documents I was ordered to falsify.
[00:13:03.264 --> 00:13:04.405]  This is a major felony.
[00:13:04.845 --> 00:13:15.352]  These intercepts, and to change them, because the originals show the specifics of plans to hijack jets and fly them into buildings, and indeed the president and his staff had seen them.
[00:13:16.413 --> 00:13:17.554]  Of course they'd seen them.
[00:13:18.294 --> 00:13:19.055]  But the point is,
[00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:24.952]  That they threatened to arrest her and then said, okay, if you'll just shut up, we'll give you a better job.
[00:13:25.012 --> 00:13:27.392]  And she said, no way, and now she's being followed and harassed.
[00:13:27.712 --> 00:13:28.493]  And that's a big deal.
[00:13:29.333 --> 00:13:30.053]  You don't hear that.
[00:13:30.293 --> 00:13:35.835]  When you read the headlines in Time Magazine and the Washington Post and the Washington Times across the political spectrum,
[00:13:37.308 --> 00:13:40.410]  It's, man, you know, Clinton was bad, so was Bush.
[00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:41.310]  They just didn't know.
[00:13:41.370 --> 00:14:03.782]  It's a culture of ignorance and not communicating, and it's the bureaucracy's fault, and it's the FBI and the CIA's fault, and we didn't know, and we just need a domestic CIA, and we need to get the rest of your liberties, and we need to support the Patriot Act, and get behind that, John Ashcroft said in testimony, and basically it's all a big sales job for them to get more power in our lives.
[00:14:05.399 --> 00:14:07.260]  Oh, it's this culture in the FBI.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.782]  You know, the culture in the CIA.
[00:14:09.842 --> 00:14:10.542]  It's their fault.
[00:14:10.983 --> 00:14:13.384]  They were ordered not to stop Al-Qaeda.
[00:14:13.424 --> 00:14:15.225]  They were given bonuses!
[00:14:15.666 --> 00:14:19.608]  Record cash bonuses and promotions for doing it.
[00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:24.291]  And then the heroes get demoted and get in deep trouble.
[00:14:27.526 --> 00:14:28.587]  Now, this is all public.
[00:14:29.007 --> 00:14:30.148]  This is not our opinion here.
[00:14:30.168 --> 00:14:42.656]  We have over 600 articles and a whole section on this, I guess about 50 of them on this, on telling the FBI and CIA to back off, on prisonplanet.com and the 9-11 archive, and on infowars.com, the 9-11 archive.
[00:14:42.696 --> 00:14:43.697]  Two separate archives.
[00:14:44.977 --> 00:14:46.238]  I've written a book on the subject.
[00:14:46.318 --> 00:14:47.739]  I've published a book on the subject.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:48.940]  That's two books.
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:54.604]  I've made two videos that are predominantly about 9-11 and other government-sponsored terror incidences.
[00:14:55.865 --> 00:14:55.985]  And...
[00:14:57.268 --> 00:15:03.393]  It is the wildest, craziest conspiracy theory to say that 19 hijackers did this.
[00:15:03.673 --> 00:15:08.257]  When the 19 hijackers, at least 7, the numbers are 9, are still alive.
[00:15:08.578 --> 00:15:09.558]  They were trained at U.S.
[00:15:09.598 --> 00:15:10.299]  military bases.
[00:15:10.319 --> 00:15:15.003]  They had their cars, their credit cards, paid for by the FBI.
[00:15:16.144 --> 00:15:18.366]  They had CIA people wiring them money.
[00:15:19.633 --> 00:15:20.253]  All of this.
[00:15:20.954 --> 00:15:22.334]  NORAD standing down.
[00:15:22.434 --> 00:15:24.635]  Public officials getting warnings not to fly.
[00:15:24.895 --> 00:15:35.758]  The CIA running a drill that morning of flying hijacked jets into buildings in New York and D.C., using that as the shutdown order against NORAD that's full of patriots who just sat there thinking it was a drill.
[00:15:36.598 --> 00:15:38.258]  I mean, it's obvious what happened.
[00:15:40.979 --> 00:15:45.240]  And remember, the globalists like to leave calling cards of what they've done.
[00:15:45.681 --> 00:15:47.101]  In fact, get that clip ready, Stephanie.
[00:15:48.846 --> 00:15:53.569]  The globalists like to leave calling cards on the one-year anniversary of 9-11.
[00:15:55.931 --> 00:16:07.539]  Not the Illinois, not the Texas, not the California, not the Ohio lottery, but the New York lottery came up 9-11 on the one-year anniversary.
[00:16:07.859 --> 00:16:13.043]  The Chicago mercantile came up, the big derivative stock market,
[00:16:15.133 --> 00:16:16.653]  The big futures market came up 9-11.000000.
[00:16:16.773 --> 00:16:20.314]  I have all the AP articles on this.
[00:16:20.334 --> 00:16:22.115]  That's like 1 out of 14 billion, they said.
[00:16:22.855 --> 00:16:23.615]  Why did that happen?
[00:16:24.215 --> 00:16:25.975]  Why was there a Phillips TV ad?
[00:16:26.035 --> 00:16:26.996]  I have the AP article on this.
[00:16:27.016 --> 00:16:29.456]  I've never seen the TV ad, but I've read the article about it.
[00:16:29.896 --> 00:16:35.858]  Where F-16s bomb the World Trade Center, and it says, Phillips, changing the way you live your life.
[00:16:36.438 --> 00:16:37.458]  That was two years before 9-11.
[00:16:37.478 --> 00:16:37.698]  Why did the 1999...
[00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:49.766]  Justice Department Terrorism Threat Manual have images of crosshairs on the exact points of the towers that were hit by planes.
[00:16:50.746 --> 00:16:57.748]  Why did the Arabs put out 45,000 calendars showing a plane flying in to the World Trade Centers?
[00:16:58.929 --> 00:17:00.449]  Why, why, why?
[00:17:01.089 --> 00:17:02.270]  Why was this everywhere?
[00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.211]  Why did Tom Clancy write two books about it?
[00:17:07.262 --> 00:17:29.797]  Why did Rupert Murdoch, deep neocon, high-level functionary for the New World Order, why did he, months before 9-11, it was written six months before, aired three months before, why did they air this lone gunman piece where a secret government group hijacks a jumbo jet by remote control to fly it into the World Trade Center as a pretext for war, weapons sales, and a police state?
[00:17:31.038 --> 00:17:33.279]  By the way, we found a website where you can download the whole thing.
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.622]  I don't know how long the site will be up after we've linked to it, but...
[00:17:37.802 --> 00:17:40.303]  But it's on Infowars.com right now.
[00:17:41.743 --> 00:17:43.884]  So later today or tonight, I guess you can go watch that.
[00:17:43.984 --> 00:17:47.445]  But I got a little clip of it in my film Masters of Terror, the key part.
[00:17:47.945 --> 00:17:54.867]  But this is from the lone gunman, where they explain exactly what happened on 9-11, months before.
[00:17:56.327 --> 00:17:57.828]  And again, this is what the globalists do.
[00:17:57.888 --> 00:17:58.968]  It's like the Madrid bombings.
[00:17:58.988 --> 00:18:00.549]  911 days from 9-11, and it wasn't just 911 days, it was on 3-11.
[00:18:06.934 --> 00:18:11.275]  You're starting to get the picture of what's going on here.
[00:18:11.315 --> 00:18:12.436]  Go ahead and hit that clip.
[00:18:13.316 --> 00:18:14.696]  What is Scenario 12D?
[00:18:17.557 --> 00:18:22.218]  We know it's a war game scenario, and it has to do with airline counterterrorism.
[00:18:23.639 --> 00:18:25.119]  Why is it important enough to kill for?
[00:18:25.799 --> 00:18:27.160]  Because it's no longer a game.
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:35.702]  If some terrorist group wants to act out this scenario, why target you for assassination?
[00:18:36.158 --> 00:18:37.779]  Depends on who your terrorists are.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.521]  The men who conceived of it in the first place.
[00:18:44.003 --> 00:18:47.565]  You're saying our government plans to commit a terrorist act against a domestic heirloom?
[00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:48.065]  There you go.
[00:18:48.446 --> 00:18:50.167]  And dying the entire government, as usual.
[00:18:50.187 --> 00:18:51.367]  It's a faction.
[00:18:51.688 --> 00:18:52.728]  A small faction.
[00:18:52.748 --> 00:18:53.909]  For what possible gain?
[00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:56.431]  The Cold War's over, John.
[00:18:57.131 --> 00:19:00.173]  But with no clear enemy to stockpile against the arms market's flat.
[00:19:00.811 --> 00:19:12.900]  But bring down a fully loaded 727 into the middle of New York City, and you'll find a dozen tin-pot dictators all over the world just clamoring to take responsibility and begging to be smart-bombed.
[00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:13.881]  I can't believe it.
[00:19:14.201 --> 00:19:15.803]  This is about increasing our sales.
[00:19:18.585 --> 00:19:18.805]  When?
[00:19:19.746 --> 00:19:20.106]  Tonight.
[00:19:21.667 --> 00:19:22.508]  How are you going to stop them?
[00:19:25.342 --> 00:19:26.663]  Why didn't you tell the world this?
[00:19:26.943 --> 00:19:27.644]  Go to the press!
[00:19:27.964 --> 00:19:30.726]  You think I'd still be drawing breath 30 minutes after I made that call?
[00:19:31.347 --> 00:19:31.887]  The press?
[00:19:32.368 --> 00:19:33.368]  Who's going to run this story?
[00:19:33.649 --> 00:19:34.149]  We would.
[00:19:34.429 --> 00:19:34.689]  This?
[00:19:38.272 --> 00:19:39.673]  This is Birdcage Liner.
[00:19:40.234 --> 00:19:44.537]  Wild-eyed crap right up there with Elvis as an alien and two-headed babies.
[00:19:44.557 --> 00:19:45.638]  You obviously read it.
[00:19:46.098 --> 00:19:47.700]  Don't be so damn naive.
[00:19:49.721 --> 00:19:50.822]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:51.743 --> 00:19:52.764]  We'll be back.
[00:19:52.964 --> 00:19:54.365]  Stay with us.
[00:19:55.265 --> 00:19:57.512]  In the show, they try to play on the planet of the World Trade Center.
[00:20:03.027 --> 00:20:08.531]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:20:08.932 --> 00:20:13.175]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:20:13.415 --> 00:20:20.441]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:20:20.821 --> 00:20:26.946]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:20:27.086 --> 00:20:28.287]  There are no side effects.
[00:20:28.427 --> 00:20:30.649]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:20:45.399 --> 00:20:48.543]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:20:48.563 --> 00:20:48.744]  866-885-6625.
[00:20:48.764 --> 00:20:48.924]  866-885-6625.
[00:20:48.944 --> 00:20:49.845]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:20:49.865 --> 00:20:50.065]  Call today.
[00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.790]  Gold.
[00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:02.411]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:21:02.671 --> 00:21:08.752]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:21:08.953 --> 00:21:12.774]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:21:13.134 --> 00:21:15.014]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:21:15.054 --> 00:21:17.355]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:21:17.495 --> 00:21:24.317]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker and weaker.
[00:21:24.597 --> 00:21:25.518]  We're good to go.
[00:21:45.418 --> 00:21:48.002]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[00:21:48.022 --> 00:21:48.543]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.996 --> 00:22:05.500]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.943]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:22:10.223 --> 00:22:10.784]  We listened.
[00:22:11.084 --> 00:22:16.068]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:22:16.348 --> 00:22:16.829]  We listened.
[00:22:17.209 --> 00:22:20.251]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:22:20.692 --> 00:22:21.212]  We listened.
[00:22:21.693 --> 00:22:24.735]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:27.241]  We're good to go.
[00:22:51.568 --> 00:22:52.571]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:22:52.591 --> 00:22:54.215]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:23:00.072 --> 00:23:00.713]  Urgent message.
[00:23:00.953 --> 00:23:08.178]  Effective April 14, 2004, heavy fines and penalties will be imposed for all persons and entities who are not in compliance with HIPAA.
[00:23:08.318 --> 00:23:11.920]  HIPAA is a federal law designed to protect all patients' private health information.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:17.504]  It impacts over 30 million health professionals, but will also impact professionals outside of the medical field.
[00:23:17.724 --> 00:23:22.487]  This year, Health and Human Services has developed a program to reward those who report violators of HIPAA.
[00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:25.409]  There are thousands of violations currently, and the numbers are growing.
[00:23:25.629 --> 00:23:26.169]  We're good to go.
[00:23:53.519 --> 00:23:55.120]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:22.172]  I've got a whole bunch of these clips from the Lone Gunman.
[00:24:22.192 --> 00:24:24.434]  We might play some more later in the next hour.
[00:24:25.374 --> 00:24:27.636]  And I'll re-air that one again later as well.
[00:24:28.796 --> 00:24:41.384]  And again, months before 9-11, this is on television with a secret government group hijacking a jumbo jet by remote control to fly it into the World Trade Center so they can attack a bunch of foreign enemies and sell weapons.
[00:24:42.944 --> 00:25:00.490]  Now, when you listen to what the government agent tells his son, the publisher of the Lone Gunman conspiracy theorist website and newspaper, he talks about why they're doing this, because the Cold War is over, they need a new enemy, so they're manufacturing one.
[00:25:02.451 --> 00:25:09.093]  And that's exactly what the PNAC documents, the Project for an American Century, said from 1997 until 2001, and are still saying.
[00:25:11.218 --> 00:25:20.046]  That's exactly what Brzezinski and his book, The Grand Chessboard, the former National Security Advisor, founder of the Trilateral Commission, had to say.
[00:25:20.086 --> 00:25:27.112]  They said that attacks, whether real or promulgated, are the pretext for imperial mobilization.
[00:25:27.152 --> 00:25:28.093]  That's a term they use.
[00:25:28.533 --> 00:25:29.314]  Imperial.
[00:25:29.434 --> 00:25:31.696]  Imperial mobilization.
[00:25:31.716 --> 00:25:37.741]  That's what you see now with the draft coming up and all of our troops overseas and all of this happening.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.421]  PNAC said Saddam wasn't a threat.
[00:25:40.661 --> 00:25:41.881]  They said it was about oil.
[00:25:42.301 --> 00:25:45.443]  They said it was about using Iraq as a launch base and for weapons sales.
[00:25:45.843 --> 00:25:52.286]  And they said that they needed a helpful, this is a quote, helpful Pearl Harbor event.
[00:25:53.206 --> 00:26:00.549]  And Ron Paul simply gave a speech about this last year and got threatening calls from Chief Neocons that he better shut his mouth.
[00:26:01.409 --> 00:26:04.371]  They put out publications saying all this.
[00:26:04.451 --> 00:26:07.632]  We pointed out, and congressmen get mean phone calls.
[00:26:10.154 --> 00:26:15.438]  So, Rupert Murdoch, in his little planning sessions with the globalists, didn't just pull all of this out of a hat.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:24.024]  Phillips, the big technology manufacturer, television manufacturer, electronics manufacturer, didn't just pull out of a hat.
[00:26:25.645 --> 00:26:30.108]  F-16s dropping bombs on the World Trade Center two years before it even happened.
[00:26:30.148 --> 00:26:32.650]  That's now coming up on five years ago.
[00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:36.893]  Phillips, changing the way you live your life, changing your world.
[00:26:38.931 --> 00:26:43.314]  They don't just have the Chicago Mercantile come up 9-11 on 9-11, the year anniversary.
[00:26:43.334 --> 00:26:44.294]  They don't do any of this.
[00:26:44.535 --> 00:26:50.038]  They don't just leave skull and bones, death cards at sniper scenes, which Northwoods calls for, by the way.
[00:26:50.058 --> 00:26:50.358]  The U.S.
[00:26:50.378 --> 00:26:53.980]  government planned to carry out sniper attacks and how to frame patsies.
[00:26:55.041 --> 00:26:59.324]  They do all this as a communication to their echelons, their people.
[00:26:59.344 --> 00:27:02.786]  And then we talk about it, and we're weirdos, we're nuts.
[00:27:04.844 --> 00:27:11.950]  And watching that episode, I mean, it goes on and on and on with why the globalists are carrying out terror attacks.
[00:27:12.691 --> 00:27:21.158]  And then in the real world, we've caught the British doing it, we've caught the Israelis doing it, we've caught the Chinese doing it, we've caught the Russians doing it, we've caught Hitler doing it.
[00:27:22.019 --> 00:27:25.462]  Over and over and over again, this is one of their favorite tactics.
[00:27:26.989 --> 00:27:30.090]  And now out of 9-11, out of the commission, ooh, they're in trouble.
[00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:33.411]  The government's going to get more funding and domestic CIA.
[00:27:33.891 --> 00:27:41.213]  That'll show you when you all get raises and more power, that'll teach you for letting 9-11 take place.
[00:27:42.273 --> 00:27:46.814]  While in plain view, it's admitted that Bush ordered the FBI not to stop Al-Qaeda.
[00:27:47.375 --> 00:27:49.955]  And the neocons go, well, Clinton did it too.
[00:27:50.395 --> 00:27:51.136]  Exactly.
[00:27:51.176 --> 00:27:52.916]  That shows how bad things are.
[00:27:53.116 --> 00:27:56.037]  But the entire full spectrum is controlled.
[00:27:57.955 --> 00:28:00.476]  Let's go to Tim in Montana, and then we'll go to Marcus and others.
[00:28:00.516 --> 00:28:01.217]  Tim, go ahead.
[00:28:01.237 --> 00:28:03.097]  Hello, Alex.
[00:28:03.278 --> 00:28:03.798]  Hello, Tim.
[00:28:04.258 --> 00:28:06.719]  Hey, I just wanted to say thanks for all that you do.
[00:28:06.739 --> 00:28:16.364]  I got your three videos on 9-11 and the Grove and the financial reports, and I'm making copies and sending them out.
[00:28:17.044 --> 00:28:27.229]  You should be getting from me, probably in a day or two, a copy of a book and some tapes and outlines that will explain, like from the prophecy side,
[00:28:28.582 --> 00:28:29.503]  What's going on.
[00:28:29.583 --> 00:28:29.963]  Okay.
[00:28:30.264 --> 00:28:36.531]  I also sent you and your wife a couple of presents that I picked up last summer in Jerusalem when I was there.
[00:28:37.112 --> 00:28:38.033]  Well, God bless you.
[00:28:38.073 --> 00:28:38.634]  Thank you so much.
[00:28:38.674 --> 00:28:41.817]  God bless you, my friend, and let's carry on.
[00:28:42.618 --> 00:28:43.099]  Well, thank you.
[00:28:43.139 --> 00:28:43.880]  Anything else, Tim?
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.862]  No, no, that's really it.
[00:28:45.902 --> 00:28:48.185]  What do you think of that Lone Gunman clip I just played?
[00:28:48.975 --> 00:28:53.076]  I didn't get the seat because I can't be online and talk to you at the same time.
[00:28:53.156 --> 00:28:53.856]  Oh, I understand.
[00:28:53.896 --> 00:28:55.556]  So to call in, you had to... Right, right.
[00:28:55.997 --> 00:28:59.777]  I got off, but I keep track of what you're doing.
[00:28:59.817 --> 00:29:03.458]  And when you get my stuff, if you want to call me, I can tell you more about it.
[00:29:03.618 --> 00:29:04.018]  Okay.
[00:29:04.738 --> 00:29:08.079]  But at the very least, you should take a look at the Gerbendorf flick.
[00:29:08.459 --> 00:29:09.939]  That's only about 54 minutes.
[00:29:10.039 --> 00:29:13.220]  It's got actual footage from 1960 about the stuff.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.720]  And it's all playing out.
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.321]  One of the reasons the Vatican is being silenced
[00:29:17.952 --> 00:29:23.676]  Because it was endorsed by the church in the 50s that this is the last pope.
[00:29:24.877 --> 00:29:31.881]  Okay, well thank you for the call, Tim, and I'll replay that clip later so everybody can hear it.
[00:29:33.803 --> 00:29:36.385]  Man, I tell you, Rupert Murdoch, what an insider.
[00:29:37.405 --> 00:29:42.849]  Productions about the government hijacking jets by remote control to fly to the World Trade Center for a police take.
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.783]  My, just a few months before 9-11.
[00:29:45.843 --> 00:29:46.845]  What a prediction.
[00:29:46.945 --> 00:29:47.666]  My goodness.
[00:29:48.267 --> 00:29:49.028]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:50.851 --> 00:29:51.773]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.233 --> 00:29:53.836]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.856 --> 00:29:57.462]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.987 --> 00:30:05.588]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[00:30:05.788 --> 00:30:10.250]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:24.434]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey light water purifier, an LED base, two Berkey sport filtration bottles, the Berkey battery adapter, the Berkey MP solar charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey purification elements.
[00:30:24.674 --> 00:30:47.700]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones, as well as power for small applications, yet the one-stop solution for your emergency and everyday needs.
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:50.521]  The Berkey Security Pack, a retail value of $518 for only $399.
[00:30:53.362 --> 00:30:54.843]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:30:54.943 --> 00:30:56.124]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:31:15.339 --> 00:31:19.242]  PTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:31:19.362 --> 00:31:19.802]  Fragrance?
[00:31:20.182 --> 00:31:24.946]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:31:25.066 --> 00:31:29.749]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:31:29.989 --> 00:31:32.411]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[00:31:32.791 --> 00:31:36.213]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:31:36.353 --> 00:31:39.935]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:31:40.115 --> 00:31:42.456]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:31:42.636 --> 00:31:43.517]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:31:43.637 --> 00:31:53.382]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.
[00:31:53.563 --> 00:31:56.104]  Call Cal Bend toll free, 1-800-340-7091 or visit calbendpuresoap.com.
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:06.122]  Old timers remember a time when things were a bit slower, and most folks really did take the time to stop and smell the roses.
[00:32:06.362 --> 00:32:11.924]  That was back when gardeners grew tomatoes that tasted like tomato, and watermelons that tasted like watermelon was supposed to.
[00:32:12.165 --> 00:32:14.485]  Sweet corn that was real sweet sweet corn.
[00:32:14.646 --> 00:32:15.686]  Well, you get the idea.
[00:32:15.846 --> 00:32:25.750]  Too bad the big seed companies became big greed companies, and decided that hybrids grown in hothouses, artificially ripened with gas, could be grown much quicker, fetching more money at the large grocery stores.
[00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:35.560]  Folks at the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company remember that simpler time and are proud to be offering non-GMO heirloom seeds to gardeners who value flavor and variety over speed and greed.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:44.909]  There's seed for fruits and vegetables of all kinds, seed for flowers and herbs, annuals and perennials, and some great books written by experts in the field to help get you started on the road to success.
[00:32:45.209 --> 00:32:49.352]  That's 417-924-8917 or visit rareseeds.com and get started on the pathway to great gardening and great flavor.
[00:33:15.092 --> 00:33:19.315]  Alright, we've got a lot more coming up for you in the next 2 hours and 27 minutes.
[00:33:20.095 --> 00:33:23.357]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[00:33:23.637 --> 00:33:36.185]  About 10-15 minutes ago, I aired a little minute and a half clip from an episode of the spin-off series, The Lone Gunman from Fox.
[00:33:36.225 --> 00:33:41.008]  I put a clip of this in my second film, covering 9-11, called The Masters of Terror.
[00:33:42.626 --> 00:33:45.549]  We're going to play some clips you never heard before here on the show.
[00:33:45.569 --> 00:33:59.620]  We played the clip earlier where he's asking the top government agent why is the government going to carry out this terror attack with a remote-controlled jet into the World Trade Centers, and he explains that it's a way to get weapons sales and invade countries.
[00:34:00.541 --> 00:34:07.307]  And then the next clip we're going to play later is where they talk about it's the World Trade Center, and they're trying to stop that from happening.
[00:34:07.327 --> 00:34:08.148]  So that's coming up.
[00:34:08.708 --> 00:34:10.610]  Also, in about 55 minutes from now...
[00:34:12.134 --> 00:34:21.918]  At the halfway point in the broadcast, we're going to have Paul Joseph Watson with a big News Blitz weekly update report for you with the Watson Report, the webmaster of PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:23.039 --> 00:34:26.120]  We'll join us, and we'll take calls as well, just a ton of news.
[00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:29.501]  We'll get into the 78 troops killed this month in Iraq.
[00:34:30.762 --> 00:34:34.503]  The top general over in the Middle East seeks more combat troops, 80,000 more.
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:39.082]  They were supposed to send some home, but they said, no, you can't go home.
[00:34:39.602 --> 00:34:42.424]  They want 80,000 more, and they've got the draft ready.
[00:34:43.164 --> 00:34:47.286]  After the next terror attack, look for that universal draft to come in for men and women.
[00:34:47.827 --> 00:34:55.912]  Iraqi gunmen batter another American supply line, another convoy, and another GI killed as troops deploy outside Najaf.
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:00.281]  Also, FBI probes about 40 abductions in Iraq.
[00:35:00.301 --> 00:35:01.622]  Just a horrible situation.
[00:35:02.082 --> 00:35:06.323]  Iraq's clerics say coalition must pay for the crisis they say they created.
[00:35:06.823 --> 00:35:08.784]  Also, new reports of U.S.
[00:35:08.844 --> 00:35:11.425]  planting weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
[00:35:11.525 --> 00:35:13.306]  Ryerson found in Washington apartment.
[00:35:14.526 --> 00:35:17.687]  Four Italian security guards kidnapped in Iraq of the latest kidnappings.
[00:35:18.167 --> 00:35:20.748]  Rice shifts blame for 9-11.
[00:35:21.208 --> 00:35:22.709]  FBI and CIA.
[00:35:23.249 --> 00:35:25.470]  Bush sees a need for a new domestic CIA.
[00:35:27.698 --> 00:35:29.479]  So that's also coming up.
[00:35:29.819 --> 00:35:38.985]  And we'll get into John Ashcroft's disgusting testimony with his best buddy, Janet the Butcher of Waco, Reno, before the Whitewash Commission.
[00:35:39.065 --> 00:35:40.926]  So that's just some of what's coming up.
[00:35:40.966 --> 00:35:42.387]  Also a bunch of police state news.
[00:35:42.427 --> 00:35:52.513]  Before we go to Marcus and everybody else that's patiently holding and air some more of these lone gunman clips, I wanted to bring up Jim Shepard for a few minutes from New Millennium Concepts.
[00:35:52.853 --> 00:35:54.054]  Jim, good to have you on the show.
[00:35:54.294 --> 00:35:55.315]  Always a pleasure, Alex.
[00:35:56.224 --> 00:35:58.304]  Jim, so much has happened.
[00:35:58.664 --> 00:36:00.325]  So much craziness is happening.
[00:36:00.385 --> 00:36:03.325]  They admit that they're letting the troops die and put uranium.
[00:36:04.125 --> 00:36:10.367]  The CDC admits that they covered up the fact that millions of people have been brain damaged from vaccines.
[00:36:11.307 --> 00:36:14.887]  This is admitted now, even in ABC News.
[00:36:16.048 --> 00:36:18.908]  They're always getting caught doing new horrible things to us.
[00:36:19.068 --> 00:36:24.049]  How could any of us trust the government enough to drink the tap water?
[00:36:24.904 --> 00:36:26.625]  I mean, it's amazing.
[00:36:27.006 --> 00:36:28.587]  What type of stuff is in the tap water?
[00:36:29.307 --> 00:36:43.018]  Well, one of the elements that has been found in 49 states, and strangely enough, there's not even a requirement that it be tested for in many municipalities, and that's MTBE, methyl tertiary butyl ether.
[00:36:43.638 --> 00:36:50.223]  And it has been linked to testicular cancer, lymphomas, some real nasty stuff.
[00:36:51.004 --> 00:36:51.144]  And
[00:36:51.903 --> 00:37:08.907]  It's interesting that in 1987, the EPA put out a memo, because this stuff used to be in premium gas, and they said, hey, this could create a nationwide crisis, because this stuff, when it gets in the water, is very difficult to extract, and it takes a very small amount.
[00:37:09.067 --> 00:37:19.189]  One cup of it can contaminate and make undrinkable 5 million gallons of water, and there's one cup of this stuff in every gallon of reformulated gas,
[00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:23.752]  Well, interestingly enough, about three years later, they mandated that it be put in there.
[00:37:24.212 --> 00:37:26.833]  After they put out the memo saying that this is real nasty stuff.
[00:37:26.913 --> 00:37:32.795]  And, of course, it turns out to be a byproduct of the big refineries, just like fluoride is, just like...
[00:37:33.633 --> 00:37:34.813]  The depleted uranium is.
[00:37:34.873 --> 00:37:39.314]  They take a toxic waste and mandate it be put into the entire food chain.
[00:37:39.614 --> 00:37:52.778]  Bottom line, folks, you can take all the vitamins you want, everything you want to try to be healthy, but if you don't stop drinking the fluoride, the pesticides, the herbicides, the mercury, the arsenic, the heavy metals, it's all in your water.
[00:37:52.858 --> 00:37:54.538]  And once you've been drinking out of a big murky...
[00:37:55.078 --> 00:37:58.340]  A lot of these filters you buy at the store just take out the taste.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:37:59.760]  They are a filter.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.021]  They are not a purifier.
[00:38:01.441 --> 00:38:02.442]  I believe in this.
[00:38:02.682 --> 00:38:09.605]  I get a thrill off knowing that you're getting off the tap water supply and it supports this show and it's made in America.
[00:38:09.805 --> 00:38:14.447]  I'm telling you, I want you to call and get water filters and stop giving your family poison.
[00:38:14.747 --> 00:38:17.949]  Jim, it feels good to promote your product.
[00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:18.629]  I use it.
[00:38:19.522 --> 00:38:36.751]  Well, you know, if folks listen to the water filter commercials on the television so far, about the only claim that you're going to hear is it makes water taste like spring water, or it enhances it, and it's like having bottled water.
[00:38:36.831 --> 00:38:38.272]  And that's about all they say.
[00:38:38.372 --> 00:38:44.675]  And the reason why is because essentially they take out some of the chlorine and stuff that tastes bad, and the rest of the stuff is left in there.
[00:38:45.482 --> 00:38:49.427]  And for folks that are serious about their health, you really need to extract that stuff.
[00:38:49.487 --> 00:38:51.350]  It just weighs down your immune system.
[00:38:52.208 --> 00:38:55.069]  And, of course, the other advantage with our system is that it's portable.
[00:38:55.169 --> 00:38:57.030]  So if you're on the road, you can take it with you.
[00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:59.752]  Or if you're traveling or if there's some sort of an emergency.
[00:38:59.992 --> 00:39:03.873]  Well, over 100 years ago, the Queen of England gave a big award to the inventor of it.
[00:39:04.054 --> 00:39:06.935]  Now made in America, it's been obviously improved on.
[00:39:06.975 --> 00:39:07.695]  That's what happens.
[00:39:08.015 --> 00:39:08.836]  It's top of the line.
[00:39:08.856 --> 00:39:10.496]  I've been using your system for five years.
[00:39:10.516 --> 00:39:11.937]  You've been a sponsor for three now.
[00:39:12.457 --> 00:39:14.558]  Jim, tell folks real quick what the specials are.
[00:39:15.039 --> 00:39:18.280]  Okay, we have a new CD book.
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.281]  It's called Prudent Places.
[00:39:21.085 --> 00:39:24.526]  And you can get just about any information that you want.
[00:39:24.626 --> 00:39:26.207]  It's hard to get information.
[00:39:26.247 --> 00:39:28.728]  What is religious distribution around the United States?
[00:39:28.808 --> 00:39:32.689]  Where are federal operations being held in?
[00:39:32.729 --> 00:39:34.970]  What specific counties of the United States?
[00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:36.630]  What is the job market?
[00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:38.811]  Where are jobs leaving?
[00:39:38.831 --> 00:39:41.852]  500 color maps, you name it.
[00:39:41.972 --> 00:39:44.052]  It's an incredible CD book.
[00:39:44.373 --> 00:39:45.713]  We're going to include that free.
[00:39:46.917 --> 00:39:51.800]  With every order on the Berkey light, the Berkey light system without the lights, that's $199.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:55.542]  It's a true purification center system.
[00:39:55.602 --> 00:39:58.224]  So if you order that, you get Prudent Places free.
[00:39:59.645 --> 00:40:10.891]  If you order the Berkey light with lights, we're also going to give you the Prudent Places free, but we're also going to give you a VHS or CD, which is called Sheltering in Place.
[00:40:10.931 --> 00:40:15.654]  And this tells you how, during a crisis, whether it be biological, nuclear, or whatever,
[00:40:16.132 --> 00:40:20.974]  How to make your own home a shelter that will prevent these toxins from getting inside.
[00:40:21.034 --> 00:40:29.939]  And this was designed by an emergency specialist who worked for the federal government, nuclear, chemical, biological, but it's carried out by a housewife, so it's easy to understand.
[00:40:30.499 --> 00:40:30.859]  Yes, sir.
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:37.583]  So, folks, you can order that online at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:40:37.603 --> 00:40:38.783]  You can print off brochures.
[00:40:38.823 --> 00:40:40.384]  You can get test results up there.
[00:40:40.504 --> 00:40:42.585]  Again, that's BerkeyWater.com.
[00:40:43.174 --> 00:40:49.296]  You can also call our toll-free number, which is 888-803-4438.
[00:40:50.236 --> 00:40:55.418]  Now, it's important that when they go to the website or to the toll-free number, they tell them they heard it on this show to get the specials.
[00:40:55.878 --> 00:40:57.578]  How are they going to do that when they go to the website?
[00:40:58.178 --> 00:41:00.479]  Well, when they go to the website, there's an area for comments.
[00:41:00.499 --> 00:41:02.620]  So just put in there, Alex Jones, listener.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:10.162]  And what we do is we support Alex's show, and that helps us to know that we're getting a response from Alex's show.
[00:41:11.014 --> 00:41:15.543]  And you can also order those online at Infowars.com, I believe.
[00:41:16.352 --> 00:41:31.305]  Absolutely, and just when you put in the comment, put in there that you don't want a portable, murky, mini-filter, sport bottle, or the potassium iodate, put in there that you want the prudent places, or that you want, of course, the sheltering in place.
[00:41:31.345 --> 00:41:33.386]  That's 1-888-803-4438, 888-803-4438, or Infowars.com, or your website, Jim.
[00:41:33.406 --> 00:41:33.807]  Yes, sir.
[00:41:44.179 --> 00:41:44.479]  All right.
[00:41:44.499 --> 00:41:46.980]  Well, I want to thank you for coming on the broadcast, and God bless.
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:47.880]  Always a pleasure.
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:48.401]  God bless you.
[00:41:48.641 --> 00:41:49.141]  Take care.
[00:41:50.101 --> 00:41:52.042]  Okay, we're about to go back to your calls.
[00:41:52.122 --> 00:41:57.064]  Just on the whole Iraq situation, I'd like to get your response, your take on that.
[00:41:57.124 --> 00:41:57.284]  It's 800-259-9231.
[00:41:57.304 --> 00:42:02.305]  And coming up in about 20 minutes, we're going to briefly have Kelly Rushing on.
[00:42:07.356 --> 00:42:14.420]  His case went to trial yesterday in Lyon County, Kentucky, and we'll tell you what happened with that case.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.721]  You can also read what happened at Infowars.com.
[00:42:17.741 --> 00:42:26.606]  He's the gentleman that was handing out something he taped off C-SPAN, Ron Paul's famous neocon speech, where he exposes how they're all a bunch of Trotskyites.
[00:42:27.606 --> 00:42:31.048]  It's so crazy, you wouldn't believe it if it wasn't their own public statements.
[00:42:32.406 --> 00:42:36.227]  And how they said Pearl Harbor was helpful and how they need more attacks like that.
[00:42:36.807 --> 00:42:44.710]  Well, Kelly Rushing gave that video and one of my videos, because I authorize people to make copies of my videos, to a state police officer who arrested him for it.
[00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:47.270]  And they tried to get it thrown out of court.
[00:42:47.391 --> 00:42:51.232]  I'll tell you that didn't happen yesterday, but something else did.
[00:42:51.972 --> 00:42:53.812]  So that's coming up in the next hour.
[00:42:54.253 --> 00:42:59.154]  And those lone gunman clips, the one you heard and one you haven't heard, perhaps even several more,
[00:43:00.425 --> 00:43:02.766]  And you can watch all those at InfoWars.com.
[00:43:03.267 --> 00:43:10.433]  And we'll get a report also here in about 45 minutes from Paul Joseph Watson, the webmaster of my website, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:43:11.354 --> 00:43:16.298]  But the total free number to join us on air, again, is 800-259-9231.
[00:43:16.778 --> 00:43:19.040]  And Marcus in Albuquerque, Mexico.
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:19.901]  Marcus, go ahead.
[00:43:20.941 --> 00:43:22.683]  Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[00:43:22.843 --> 00:43:28.748]  I finally got my short-wave radio, but more importantly, I got Police State 3, total and safe enslavement.
[00:43:29.301 --> 00:43:30.902]  Well, I appreciate your call from Albuquerque.
[00:43:55.279 --> 00:43:56.541]  I would like to hear from the
[00:44:04.554 --> 00:44:11.278]  I listened to different talk shows, different syndicated talk shows, and it was, let's kill everybody in Fallujah.
[00:44:12.159 --> 00:44:13.639]  Boy, they got mass graves.
[00:44:13.699 --> 00:44:15.340]  Boy, they got mobile weapons trucks.
[00:44:15.561 --> 00:44:18.582]  They were still saying that on some of the big national shows.
[00:44:18.622 --> 00:44:19.543]  You probably heard them.
[00:44:20.143 --> 00:44:21.004]  Still lying.
[00:44:21.724 --> 00:44:24.966]  They were saying, let's level that town.
[00:44:25.586 --> 00:44:27.968]  The government's wrong to be having a ceasefire.
[00:44:28.008 --> 00:44:28.728]  Let's kill them.
[00:44:30.402 --> 00:44:38.090]  The government was going to go in and make war on these people again, and I'm not supporting the Muslims either, my friends, or the Arabs.
[00:44:39.571 --> 00:44:43.335]  The whole thing is a mess, but you've got these armchair quarterbacks.
[00:44:44.045 --> 00:44:44.705]  We're good to go.
[00:45:10.186 --> 00:45:12.407]  They've given press conferences where the generals admit this.
[00:45:12.447 --> 00:45:16.608]  They're putting them in giant FEMA-style camps run by Halliburton.
[00:45:18.128 --> 00:45:18.789]  It's horrible.
[00:45:18.969 --> 00:45:21.569]  I mean, Bush was on TV last night in his press conference.
[00:45:22.450 --> 00:45:23.510]  He's got another one tonight.
[00:45:23.530 --> 00:45:27.931]  He's going to address the nation saying things are better in Iraq.
[00:45:28.051 --> 00:45:28.991]  I've talked to the troops.
[00:45:29.011 --> 00:45:29.712]  They're not better.
[00:45:32.072 --> 00:45:33.653]  It's total bedlam over there.
[00:45:36.113 --> 00:45:37.854]  And even our supposed...
[00:45:38.915 --> 00:45:39.956]  Allies.
[00:45:40.756 --> 00:45:43.098]  Our precious little allies.
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.122]  Even they are attacking us, the Shiites.
[00:45:49.202 --> 00:45:56.988]  So it's kind of hard for people to say it's some secret Al-Qaeda-controlled group, or, oh, it's Iran doing all this, let's attack Iran.
[00:45:58.349 --> 00:46:01.711]  Actually, Iran's scared to death and has been trying to comply with the globalists.
[00:46:02.231 --> 00:46:04.613]  So is Qaddafi and the rest of these people.
[00:46:05.914 --> 00:46:10.937]  Meanwhile, Pakistan, our big buddies, have been arming everybody with nuclear weapons parts.
[00:46:12.638 --> 00:46:18.021]  Which our government, which Bush ordered the FBI not to investigate, and blocked that investigation too.
[00:46:18.482 --> 00:46:23.805]  That was out before 9-11 and the BBC, but still the average American has no idea.
[00:46:23.825 --> 00:46:26.847]  I mean, let's hold Bush to the same standard.
[00:46:26.887 --> 00:46:28.508]  Bush is a puppet, but he has a figurehead.
[00:46:28.528 --> 00:46:30.129]  Let's hold the government to the same standard.
[00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:31.930]  They say...
[00:46:32.836 --> 00:46:38.499]  That anybody who has connections to Al-Qaeda or Saddam or any of these groups needs to be arrested.
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:51.086]  No one has more connections to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to every boogeyman we've seen in the last 15 years than the Bushes.
[00:46:52.367 --> 00:46:52.807]  No one!
[00:46:53.327 --> 00:46:58.230]  Manuel Noriega, Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden,
[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:04.665]  The nuclear proliferation with this scientist, Khan, is his name, over in Pakistan.
[00:47:05.345 --> 00:47:12.130]  Israel, in their own harrots, and Jerusalem Post admits that their government's been caught arming Iran.
[00:47:12.331 --> 00:47:14.132]  Why is Israel arming Iran?
[00:47:14.532 --> 00:47:19.336]  Why is our government arming all of these people that do want to kill us?
[00:47:20.637 --> 00:47:27.783]  I mean, have you figured, because it's just like the old Western, where the bad guy has just gunned down, you know, the...
[00:47:29.321 --> 00:47:29.942]  Picture this.
[00:47:30.203 --> 00:47:31.545]  Enter the small town.
[00:47:32.146 --> 00:47:33.248]  Small western town.
[00:47:34.389 --> 00:47:40.179]  In comes riding the local gold miner with his son riding up in the buggy with him.
[00:47:42.125 --> 00:47:43.246]  In between him and Mama.
[00:47:43.727 --> 00:47:47.070]  And they're riding into the general store to buy some things they need.
[00:47:47.090 --> 00:47:51.393]  And they go in and get their fuel oil and get some blankets and get Mama a new dress.
[00:47:51.433 --> 00:47:52.995]  And he sells some of his gold there.
[00:47:53.055 --> 00:47:54.917]  And he's walking back out.
[00:47:55.417 --> 00:47:56.398]  And the railroad.
[00:47:56.578 --> 00:47:59.541]  There's a lot of Westerns along these lines because these are true stories.
[00:47:59.561 --> 00:48:00.562]  This has happened hundreds of times.
[00:48:01.062 --> 00:48:01.983]  He comes walking out.
[00:48:02.023 --> 00:48:05.866]  He's refused to give up his claim to the railroad that wants the gold mine he's found.
[00:48:06.427 --> 00:48:07.548]  That he's working by hand.
[00:48:07.588 --> 00:48:08.569]  He comes walking out.
[00:48:10.438 --> 00:48:13.099]  Of the general store where he just sold his gold.
[00:48:13.139 --> 00:48:18.961]  And there is the new deputy, the new regulator, the new enforcer, the Pinkerton.
[00:48:19.482 --> 00:48:22.923]  By the way, this story I'm telling, the Pinkertons did this all over the country.
[00:48:22.943 --> 00:48:24.463]  I mean, just pick your case.
[00:48:24.503 --> 00:48:27.024]  Colorado, Texas, Arizona, California.
[00:48:28.405 --> 00:48:33.987]  And the old guy walks up, and there's three regulators standing there in their black outfits.
[00:48:34.687 --> 00:48:36.748]  And they've got their six guns on both hips.
[00:48:37.805 --> 00:48:40.407]  And he tells him, you know, give me that money.
[00:48:40.467 --> 00:48:41.808]  You stole that from the railroad.
[00:48:41.868 --> 00:48:43.169]  We really own that claim.
[00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:45.831]  And he says, Master, I've had this claim for ten years.
[00:48:45.891 --> 00:48:46.552]  You don't own it.
[00:48:46.572 --> 00:48:48.853]  And, you know, get out of my way.
[00:48:49.254 --> 00:49:04.345]  At which point they slap the gold miner's wife, and the little boy runs over and grabs the bad guy's leg, and the bad guy pulls a gun as the gold miner pulls his gun and blows the gold miner in the kingdom come.
[00:49:05.532 --> 00:49:12.416]  And then the little 12-year-old child standing there, and the bad guys throw a gun down in front of him and say, Pick it up, kid!
[00:49:12.436 --> 00:49:15.358]  And the kid picks it up, and they all three blow him to bits.
[00:49:16.058 --> 00:49:17.859]  Well, that's what Israel and the U.S.
[00:49:17.899 --> 00:49:20.520]  and England, all arming the Arabs, have done.
[00:49:21.041 --> 00:49:23.742]  They just throw the gun down and go, Go ahead, punk.
[00:49:23.862 --> 00:49:24.323]  Pick it up.
[00:49:24.823 --> 00:49:25.343]  Go ahead.
[00:49:27.344 --> 00:49:28.165]  Pick it up.
[00:49:28.565 --> 00:49:29.105]  Take it.
[00:49:29.666 --> 00:49:32.207]  Because when you pick it up, we're going to kill you.
[00:49:32.227 --> 00:49:33.728]  Do you understand that?
[00:49:35.157 --> 00:49:43.743]  But the bullet they fire into these innocent people, the bullet that they shoot into them, is our troops who die in the process.
[00:49:46.184 --> 00:49:48.506]  Oh, let's go to Larry in Michigan.
[00:49:48.566 --> 00:49:49.327]  Larry, go ahead.
[00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:54.470]  Okay, are you there, sir?
[00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:55.230]  Yes, I am.
[00:49:55.411 --> 00:49:55.811]  Go ahead.
[00:49:56.111 --> 00:49:56.671]  How are you, Alex?
[00:49:56.872 --> 00:49:57.152]  Fine.
[00:49:57.532 --> 00:49:58.533]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:49:58.693 --> 00:49:59.013]  You bet.
[00:50:00.594 --> 00:50:03.316]  Oh, boy, I tell you, I had some fun last night listening to some of the
[00:50:03.826 --> 00:50:05.746]  He'll come on television and radio.
[00:50:06.747 --> 00:50:13.268]  But I just wondered if you or some of your listeners saw Ellen Mariani on Scarborough's report last night.
[00:50:14.308 --> 00:50:14.908]  No, I didn't.
[00:50:15.368 --> 00:50:16.568]  We've had her on the show.
[00:50:16.588 --> 00:50:19.409]  And what did the widow of the 9-11 victim say?
[00:50:21.149 --> 00:50:25.310]  You know, I've never been more ashamed of Pat Buchanan than I was last night.
[00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:29.971]  Mrs. Mariani was bringing up some points about Ashcroft.
[00:50:31.215 --> 00:50:33.896]  And I just, he ridiculed her, he wouldn't let her talk.
[00:50:34.116 --> 00:50:35.456]  Well, I'll tell you something about Pat.
[00:50:36.376 --> 00:50:38.357]  He totally changed when Bush got elected.
[00:50:39.757 --> 00:50:42.438]  And he really has been sad since then.
[00:50:42.458 --> 00:50:44.898]  I'll tell you what, stay there, I'll let you finish up.
[00:50:44.938 --> 00:50:45.558]  I didn't see this.
[00:50:45.638 --> 00:50:47.079]  I wish people taped this stuff for me.
[00:50:47.639 --> 00:50:49.539]  I guess I'll just make myself start watching it all.
[00:50:50.479 --> 00:50:51.960]  There's no way to keep track of it all, though.
[00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:54.720]  We need to get Ellen Mariani back on the show.
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:56.041]  In fact, I'm going to do that.
[00:50:57.161 --> 00:50:57.801]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:59.972 --> 00:51:04.294]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:04.514 --> 00:51:08.936]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:09.076 --> 00:51:13.438]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:13.478 --> 00:51:14.839]  The New World Order.
[00:51:16.619 --> 00:51:20.841]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:20.901 --> 00:51:27.843]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act Legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:27.963 --> 00:51:29.964]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:30.384 --> 00:51:40.666]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:40.966 --> 00:51:46.327]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:07.515]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:07.776 --> 00:52:12.138]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:12.419 --> 00:52:21.344]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[00:52:25.447 --> 00:52:30.473]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons for one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:30.774 --> 00:52:37.482]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:37.992 --> 00:52:38.653]  What about you?

[00:54:02.704 --> 00:54:13.286]  All right, going back to Larry in Michigan and Logan, Chris and others.
[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:22.664]  Larry, I didn't see beady-eyed liberal in conservatives' clothing, Mr. Scarborough, last night.
[00:54:24.605 --> 00:54:26.706]  Pat Buchanan was taking his place last night, Alex.
[00:54:27.247 --> 00:54:27.627]  Oh, okay.
[00:54:27.667 --> 00:54:29.348]  He was setting in for the beady-eyed.
[00:54:30.288 --> 00:54:32.730]  Let me tell you, and let's see if you agree with me, Alex.
[00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:34.551]  Here's what's going to go on, okay?
[00:54:34.611 --> 00:54:37.872]  If things get any worse in Iraq, and they are, you know they are.
[00:54:37.892 --> 00:54:42.735]  The globalists are going to blow something up in the U.S., and they're going to have a national draft.
[00:54:43.334 --> 00:54:46.996]  And we're going to call it National Civil Emergency, and we're going to go under total martial law.
[00:54:47.076 --> 00:54:47.897]  It's not only that.
[00:54:47.937 --> 00:54:49.678]  I mean, before that, here's what's going to happen.
[00:54:49.698 --> 00:54:55.981]  You're going to see the neocons start back-stepping now, and you'll never guess what excuse they're going to give you.
[00:54:57.943 --> 00:54:58.943]  Here's what they're going to say.
[00:54:59.063 --> 00:55:01.145]  They're going to say, well, we did our best.
[00:55:01.185 --> 00:55:06.928]  We tipped over the Statue of Saddam, and we blew your country up, and we did the best we could, so it's okay, goodbye.
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:10.501]  Now it's going to be the Iraqis' fault now.
[00:55:10.521 --> 00:55:11.861]  Well, that was the plan all along.
[00:55:12.461 --> 00:55:23.385]  For a year before the war, we're going to play the part of the bad cops, then the UN's going to come in as the good cops, and that's been the plan from the Rome public statements from the beginning.
[00:55:23.745 --> 00:55:24.865]  This is all staged.
[00:55:24.945 --> 00:55:29.507]  Even the London Guardian said our government's doing stuff they know was going to cause all this.
[00:55:30.067 --> 00:55:33.268]  Yeah, I heard that when they were interviewing a soldier on Fox News.
[00:55:33.308 --> 00:55:35.388]  I just couldn't watch no more of it, Alex.
[00:55:35.708 --> 00:55:37.289]  It's getting to where I just can't watch it anymore.
[00:55:37.904 --> 00:55:45.229]  Well, now they're saying they're going to kill this imam, this cleric, which he wants to die, and then the whole place is going to explode.
[00:55:45.389 --> 00:55:45.609]  I know.
[00:55:45.629 --> 00:55:46.490]  Isn't that sick, Alex?
[00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:47.590]  Alex, this is sick.
[00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:49.672]  Well, it's about getting our troops killed.
[00:55:49.732 --> 00:55:50.932]  They hate our troops.
[00:55:50.952 --> 00:55:57.096]  This is about turning our military into nothing but a tool of the U.N., and our troops are still going to be there.
[00:55:57.357 --> 00:55:58.597]  It's just going to be under a U.N.
[00:55:58.677 --> 00:55:59.038]  system.
[00:55:59.298 --> 00:55:59.578]  Yes.
[00:56:00.379 --> 00:56:01.299]  I totally agree with you.
[00:56:01.319 --> 00:56:04.061]  And by the way, I'm getting the tapes out as fast as I can.
[00:56:04.081 --> 00:56:05.162]  I'm recording as we speak.
[00:56:05.202 --> 00:56:07.223]  I've got five recorded today and yesterday.
[00:56:08.157 --> 00:56:09.719]  So we're getting them out as quick as we can.
[00:56:09.759 --> 00:56:10.980]  I hope I get arrested for it.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.682]  I don't know.
[00:56:13.702 --> 00:56:14.884]  Maybe I can.
[00:56:14.924 --> 00:56:16.885]  Maybe it'll wake up some people.
[00:56:17.086 --> 00:56:19.268]  Well, the man that put the sign in his yard...
[00:56:20.129 --> 00:56:20.369]  I hope so.
[00:56:20.389 --> 00:56:20.649]  Go ahead.
[00:56:20.669 --> 00:56:21.730]  You were going to say something else?
[00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:22.371]  Yeah, I was.
[00:56:45.205 --> 00:56:48.388]  Could you give me the site for Mary Ann?
[00:56:48.508 --> 00:56:51.190]  I redid my computer, and I lost her website.
[00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:51.750]  Do you have it?
[00:56:52.251 --> 00:56:53.652]  Lost whose site?
[00:56:53.772 --> 00:56:58.376]  Ellen Mariani's website with her attorney, Mr. Berg.
[00:56:58.396 --> 00:57:00.437]  You know, I don't have it in front of me, so I'm sorry.
[00:57:00.457 --> 00:57:03.139]  I looked for that, and I could not find it, and I thought maybe you had it.
[00:57:03.299 --> 00:57:05.601]  Type Ellen Mariani into a search engine, and it will pop up.
[00:57:06.022 --> 00:57:07.002]  I appreciate it, Alex.
[00:57:07.083 --> 00:57:08.163]  I appreciate you, sir.
[00:57:08.203 --> 00:57:08.644]  Keep it up.
[00:57:09.364 --> 00:57:13.728]  Speaking of videotapes, I'll take this last minute of the broadcast, well, of this hour.
[00:57:14.676 --> 00:57:15.636]  Two more hours coming up.
[00:57:39.039 --> 00:57:41.200]  I just want to get the information out.
[00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:43.741]  90% of those who see the videos are waking up.
[00:57:43.861 --> 00:57:46.083]  This is a tool that's really working.
[00:57:46.243 --> 00:57:48.944]  People's minds are open to the truth now.
[00:57:49.024 --> 00:57:50.985]  They know in their guts something is wrong.
[00:57:52.246 --> 00:57:53.746]  Get 9-11 the road to tyranny.
[00:57:53.786 --> 00:57:57.108]  Get Masters of Terror to understand what really happened on September 11th.
[00:57:57.448 --> 00:57:59.369]  Get Police State 3 total enslavement.
[00:58:00.289 --> 00:58:01.810]  Get Matrix of Evil.
[00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:03.711]  Get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:58:03.991 --> 00:58:05.412]  Get my book, Descent to Tyranny.
[00:58:05.976 --> 00:58:07.437]  Toll-free number to order.
[00:58:07.517 --> 00:58:07.997]  It's simple.
[00:58:08.057 --> 00:58:08.557]  It's 1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:08.597 --> 00:58:09.198]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:58:09.218 --> 00:58:11.579]  Or prisonplanet.com or infowars.com.
[00:58:11.819 --> 00:58:13.820]  Order via our secure, safe online shopping cart.
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:17.262]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas.
[00:58:37.046 --> 00:58:41.071]  78704.
[00:58:37.166 --> 00:58:41.071]  You can also get the toll-free number and mailing address off the website.
[00:58:41.612 --> 00:58:47.900]  All right, the third hour is just mega jam-packed with your calls, a guest, a bunch of audio clips, news, you name it.
[00:58:50.305 --> 00:58:53.567]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:58:53.627 --> 00:58:57.809]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:58:58.069 --> 00:59:00.850]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:59:01.050 --> 00:59:03.451]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:59:03.631 --> 00:59:07.193]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 degrees.
[00:59:07.193 --> 00:59:08.234]  We're good to go.
[00:59:26.564 --> 00:59:26.964]  I think.
[00:59:56.312 --> 00:59:56.953]  Big Brother.
[00:59:57.613 --> 00:59:58.654]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:59.395 --> 01:00:00.496]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:01.157 --> 01:00:01.898]  You want answers?
[01:00:02.711 --> 01:00:03.592]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:03.612 --> 01:00:07.915]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:08.476 --> 01:00:16.683]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:19.445 --> 01:00:26.911]  All right, blasting out worldwide on the AM and FM dial, global shortwave during the day at 94.75, 9 to midnight central time at night, 3210.
[01:00:30.859 --> 01:00:34.621]  The Internet at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:00:34.641 --> 01:00:35.382]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.422 --> 01:00:36.202]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:00:36.683 --> 01:00:40.685]  We've got Paul Joseph Watson from the United Kingdom with his Watson Report.
[01:00:41.285 --> 01:00:49.410]  Joining us in about 30 minutes, we're going to take calls and get into the latest war news, as well as what's happening with the economy, gas prices, you name it.
[01:00:49.450 --> 01:00:50.451]  And also in this hour...
[01:00:51.678 --> 01:00:59.622]  I want to air some clips from a Fox television show, a spinoff of The X-Files, from three months before 9-11.
[01:00:59.702 --> 01:01:05.346]  The show was produced six months before 9-11, called The Lone Gunman.
[01:01:05.546 --> 01:01:07.887]  And I put a clip of this in my film, The Masters of Terror.
[01:01:08.347 --> 01:01:20.514]  We're going to play some of the lengthy audio clips, some that we haven't gotten to, not too lengthy, a few minutes long apiece, here on the show, where a secret government group is hijacking a jet...
[01:01:21.098 --> 01:01:21.679]  We're good to go.
[01:01:37.503 --> 01:01:41.107]  At least 50 news reports where terrorists were planning this.
[01:01:41.568 --> 01:01:44.851]  Two books written years before 9-11 by Tom Clancy.
[01:01:45.652 --> 01:01:48.935]  All these different federal drills of plans to fly planes into buildings.
[01:01:49.256 --> 01:01:53.260]  Official government plans, documents where they said they wanted to do this.
[01:01:54.101 --> 01:01:56.103]  PNAC plans that talked about all this.
[01:01:56.964 --> 01:01:59.507]  And then Condoleezza Rice says they never heard of such a plan.
[01:02:00.695 --> 01:02:08.481]  And now the Whitewash Commission says the answer is giving the government more power, bonuses to those that block the FBI from stopping al-Qaeda.
[01:02:08.881 --> 01:02:11.623]  You know, Bush says he never had any idea, and the FBI dropped the ball.
[01:02:12.003 --> 01:02:14.465]  Bush ordered the FBI not to stop al-Qaeda.
[01:02:14.665 --> 01:02:26.473]  This has been out for, well, since even before 9-11, that he signed W-199-I, ordering them to back off al-Qaeda and to back off the Pakistanis who were arming all these countries with nuclear weapons components.
[01:02:27.874 --> 01:02:28.915]  So that's coming up as well.
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:30.981]  A program note here.
[01:02:31.001 --> 01:02:43.369]  In the last few weeks, we've talked about Kelly Rushing in Lyon County, Kentucky, a listener of this show, who taped a C-SPAN broadcast or transmission of Ron Paul getting a speech, a congressman.
[01:02:43.729 --> 01:02:47.071]  He also got one of my videos and made a copy, 9-11 and the Road to Tyranny.
[01:02:48.312 --> 01:02:55.977]  He gave that to a state trooper, a Trooper Dodd, who then arrested him and said the video was threatening to him.
[01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:58.990]  They tried to throw it out of court yesterday.
[01:02:59.050 --> 01:02:59.990]  They failed at that.
[01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:01.131]  It went to the jury.
[01:03:02.171 --> 01:03:05.353]  They wouldn't let Mr. Rushing get any of his information out.
[01:03:05.873 --> 01:03:10.975]  But what did happen is the jury found him not guilty.
[01:03:12.125 --> 01:03:25.595]  What's scary is that the government would take something like this to trial and attempt to put him in jail for a year for giving two videotapes, one of them stuff off national television, to a state trooper.
[01:03:25.956 --> 01:03:30.199]  The state trooper, he got up on the stand, everything, said the video was threatening to him.
[01:03:30.559 --> 01:03:37.104]  I mean, this is America, where they think a video about information is a threat to them.
[01:03:37.524 --> 01:03:39.726]  It's like the guy in Alabama that got arrested for putting a
[01:03:40.558 --> 01:03:46.965]  A three-by-four sign in his yard saying our court system's a joke, and the judge told a local paper, we can't allow this type of disrespect to the government.
[01:03:47.205 --> 01:03:47.945]  That's illegal!
[01:03:49.407 --> 01:03:54.972]  So this shows how whacked out these individuals are, what's happened to their brains, what's happened to this system.
[01:03:55.773 --> 01:04:04.482]  But the good news is that time and time again, Justice Anthony Scalia had to apologize about grabbing AP reporters' tapes at a public meeting.
[01:04:06.348 --> 01:04:08.310]  He's trying to blame it on the federal marshals.
[01:04:08.350 --> 01:04:12.853]  The people are going back in time and showing where Scalia has ordered stuff like this before.
[01:04:13.233 --> 01:04:14.874]  So, of course, he's a complete liar.
[01:04:15.435 --> 01:04:18.096]  The liberal socialist that he is.
[01:04:18.717 --> 01:04:21.799]  So Anthony Scalia's had to back off, grabbing the AP reporters.
[01:04:22.179 --> 01:04:25.801]  Bottom line, they're trying to claim we don't have any rights.
[01:04:26.102 --> 01:04:28.103]  They're trying to claim we don't have a First Amendment.
[01:04:28.363 --> 01:04:33.987]  But the citizenry knows we have this God-given right and is standing up against it, so they're having to back off.
[01:04:34.665 --> 01:04:40.948]  But what's scary is they're still trying to do this coast to coast every day.
[01:04:40.968 --> 01:04:43.569]  I see articles along these similar lines.
[01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:45.830]  And that's very scary.
[01:04:46.271 --> 01:04:48.372]  They'd like to arrest us for what we have to say.
[01:04:48.672 --> 01:04:49.172]  We'll be back.
[01:04:52.023 --> 01:04:54.827]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[01:04:54.967 --> 01:04:55.809]  Michael Trudeau here.
[01:04:55.929 --> 01:04:59.234]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[01:04:59.434 --> 01:05:05.082]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[01:05:05.222 --> 01:05:08.247]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[01:05:08.507 --> 01:05:12.770]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[01:05:12.971 --> 01:05:14.892]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[01:05:14.992 --> 01:05:22.058]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[01:05:22.258 --> 01:05:24.760]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:29.344]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice, only this time it changed my life.
[01:05:29.644 --> 01:05:33.507]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement, and after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[01:05:33.587 --> 01:05:38.951]  Well, that was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since, and today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[01:05:39.131 --> 01:05:39.672]  Side effects?
[01:05:39.832 --> 01:05:42.114]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[01:05:42.274 --> 01:05:43.755]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[01:05:43.775 --> 01:05:44.015]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[01:05:44.095 --> 01:05:45.416]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[01:05:45.456 --> 01:05:46.057]  It worked for me.
[01:05:51.761 --> 01:05:58.605]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:05:58.925 --> 01:06:00.286]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:06:00.486 --> 01:06:02.687]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:06:02.847 --> 01:06:04.948]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:06:05.208 --> 01:06:10.151]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:06:10.491 --> 01:06:14.513]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:06:14.773 --> 01:06:16.554]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:06:16.634 --> 01:06:27.260]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:06:27.421 --> 01:06:29.322]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:06:50.948 --> 01:06:54.429]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:06:54.689 --> 01:06:58.189]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:06:58.289 --> 01:07:02.230]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:08.611]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:07:09.011 --> 01:07:16.913]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:22.677]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:07:22.837 --> 01:07:26.620]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:28.822]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:07:28.902 --> 01:07:31.064]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:07:31.304 --> 01:07:36.247]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:07:36.287 --> 01:07:41.852]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:07:45.234 --> 01:07:49.075]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[01:07:56.397 --> 01:07:57.097]  Big Brother.
[01:07:57.717 --> 01:07:58.858]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:59.478 --> 01:08:00.658]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:00.678 --> 01:08:02.059]  You want answers?
[01:08:02.819 --> 01:08:03.579]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:04.386 --> 01:08:08.349]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:12.672]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:15.995 --> 01:08:25.582]  Alright folks, now 8 minutes and 25 seconds into this second hour of global transmission broadcast against tyranny in defense of liberty.
[01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:30.986]  We have Paul Joseph Watson joining us with a huge news blitz of the stuff that's going on.
[01:08:31.943 --> 01:08:37.408]  Including plans to plant weapons of mass destruction for the election in Iraq.
[01:08:37.428 --> 01:08:47.436]  We've already caught this government, I don't know, over 50, 60 times, putting out false news reports of weapons of mass destruction, falsifying reports, creating false reports.
[01:08:48.897 --> 01:08:51.659]  So I wouldn't put anything past them.
[01:08:51.699 --> 01:08:54.001]  I think that's par for the course.
[01:08:54.021 --> 01:08:58.645]  We'll get into also the latest developments in Iraq and the economy.
[01:08:58.785 --> 01:09:00.947]  And I want to cover this lone gunman episode.
[01:09:02.350 --> 01:09:11.973]  Where this TV show is talking about a government plan to hijack jets and fly them into buildings, the World Trade Center specifically, to give you the police state.
[01:09:12.513 --> 01:09:13.274]  So that's coming up.
[01:09:13.314 --> 01:09:17.375]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to Chris in South Carolina.
[01:09:17.415 --> 01:09:18.155]  Chris, go ahead.
[01:09:18.695 --> 01:09:19.676]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:09:19.836 --> 01:09:23.337]  I just wanted to commend you on being a very good watchman in these end times.
[01:09:24.597 --> 01:09:30.059]  I came across some very, very interesting information and your video about the Bohemian Grove kind of
[01:09:31.004 --> 01:09:33.165]  Kind of got me to research a little bit.
[01:09:34.666 --> 01:09:35.586]  I'm not plugging this site.
[01:09:35.606 --> 01:09:38.307]  I'm not affiliated with it, but it has some very good information in it.
[01:09:38.387 --> 01:09:39.348]  Is it okay if I plug this site?
[01:09:39.368 --> 01:09:39.988]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:09:40.488 --> 01:09:44.350]  It's called cuttingedge.org, all one word, cuttingedge.org.
[01:09:45.331 --> 01:09:53.394]  If you click on the Freemasonry site, I have a very interesting link that explains much of the history of paganism and our country's leadership.
[01:09:54.655 --> 01:09:59.377]  And just for something that's very interesting, if you go to MapQuest.com,
[01:10:00.815 --> 01:10:02.797]  And look up the Washington, D.C.
[01:10:02.837 --> 01:10:03.097]  map.
[01:10:03.337 --> 01:10:06.860]  It's a giant pentagram with a big owl sitting on top of a pyramid.
[01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:08.101]  Yes, you've seen it.
[01:10:09.903 --> 01:10:12.244]  Well, they admit that D.C.
[01:10:12.304 --> 01:10:16.087]  was laid out in an occultic fashion, just as Paris has been.
[01:10:16.107 --> 01:10:20.451]  It was a French admitted occultic architect.
[01:10:20.491 --> 01:10:21.572]  He was an admitted occultist.
[01:10:22.359 --> 01:10:41.592]  And on top of it, again, Francois Mitterrand, right before he died, had a 71-foot gold pyramid with 666 pieces of glass put up in front of the Louvre, and he demanded 666 from the architect, and he put up weird obelisks and torches and 666 all over Paris.
[01:10:42.192 --> 01:10:44.313]  But again, 666 is no big deal.
[01:10:45.134 --> 01:10:46.715]  That's just the 666 deal.
[01:10:48.336 --> 01:10:49.697]  That's a revelation.
[01:10:51.292 --> 01:10:56.494]  But, like I said, it's very interesting to me to see that because I've never been taught that.
[01:10:56.834 --> 01:10:59.576]  Well, again, and most Masons hear this and get angry.
[01:10:59.656 --> 01:11:01.296]  Most Masons are low level.
[01:11:01.316 --> 01:11:03.177]  They think there's only 33 degrees.
[01:11:03.917 --> 01:11:04.878]  There's actually 360 degrees.
[01:11:04.898 --> 01:11:07.619]  Very interesting studying that stuff.
[01:11:07.639 --> 01:11:09.860]  But that's all I really want to do is report on, Allison.
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:12.061]  And I just appreciate you being out there.
[01:11:12.361 --> 01:11:13.381]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[01:11:13.421 --> 01:11:13.701]  Thanks.
[01:11:14.262 --> 01:11:16.643]  Look, it's the same thing as...
[01:11:18.658 --> 01:11:33.287]  Intelligence agencies, they're run in a compartmentalized fashion, whereas the low-level FBI agent is busting bank robbers and going after child pornographers and good things, going after bad people.
[01:11:33.987 --> 01:11:35.608]  FBI agents are doing a good job.
[01:11:36.269 --> 01:11:40.691]  But by the time you get up to the mid-levels and then the high-levels, they're criminals, people.
[01:11:41.912 --> 01:11:44.434]  I mean, they're big-time crooks, and we have the evidence of that.
[01:11:44.794 --> 01:11:48.396]  Murder for hire, prostitution, drug dealing, all of it.
[01:11:49.475 --> 01:12:01.083]  And you have good people at high levels that do go public sometimes, like Dr. Frederick Whitehurst back in 97 who quit the FBI crime lab, the head of the forensics division, and said, look, this is industrialized frame-ups going on here.
[01:12:02.344 --> 01:12:10.650]  Last year, police in the Houston crime lab went public, showing that from the prosecutors to the arresting police to the crime lab, they've been framing thousands of people.
[01:12:11.311 --> 01:12:14.193]  Other than the police chief apologizes and nobody gets fired.
[01:12:14.573 --> 01:12:15.514]  No criminal charges.
[01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:17.250]  Dallas Crime Lab.
[01:12:17.650 --> 01:12:19.452]  They'd throw a bag of chalk in your car.
[01:12:19.852 --> 01:12:20.713]  No drugs found.
[01:12:20.773 --> 01:12:21.354]  Arrest you.
[01:12:21.714 --> 01:12:23.596]  The drug lab would certify a cocaine.
[01:12:23.616 --> 01:12:25.357]  The prosecutor would move for an indictment.
[01:12:25.717 --> 01:12:27.479]  With the grand jury, people went to prison.
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:30.582]  Tulia, Texas.
[01:12:30.602 --> 01:12:31.182]  56 black people.
[01:12:31.242 --> 01:12:32.103]  No criminal records.
[01:12:32.203 --> 01:12:32.844]  No drugs.
[01:12:33.184 --> 01:12:34.125]  No paraphernalia.
[01:12:34.605 --> 01:12:35.766]  It's now come out in the news.
[01:12:35.806 --> 01:12:37.247]  The governor had to pardon them, by the way.
[01:12:37.267 --> 01:12:42.272]  By the way, he had to be pressured for years to do that after the police admitted they framed him.
[01:12:43.403 --> 01:12:48.785]  And it turns out that a local private prison was paying the police bounties on whoever they brought in.
[01:12:48.805 --> 01:12:54.207]  It was literally like a slave ship pulling up to Africa and conking black people on the head.
[01:12:54.747 --> 01:13:04.691]  Except in Thule up there in cotton country in the panhandle, they literally just pulled up, threw them in paddy wagons, drove off, 20 to 90 years in prison, in the private prison.
[01:13:05.411 --> 01:13:06.852]  And they had lots of other roundups.
[01:13:06.872 --> 01:13:09.293]  That was just one night where they arrested a whole neighborhood.
[01:13:09.673 --> 01:13:11.334]  Old women, old men, young people.
[01:13:11.974 --> 01:13:12.154]  It was
[01:13:13.188 --> 01:13:25.141]  It was like that image of Planet of the Apes, where the apes come in, that's the police, and just come in with the nets and are chasing the people through the cornfield, grabbing us, conking us on the head.
[01:13:25.161 --> 01:13:27.423]  I mean, it's that same image.
[01:13:27.603 --> 01:13:30.586]  I mean, that's what they do.
[01:13:30.646 --> 01:13:34.751]  They just pull up, chase us down, throw us in the backs of their trucks, drive off with us.
[01:13:36.508 --> 01:13:38.809]  And so that's what we're dealing with.
[01:13:39.029 --> 01:13:41.310]  And that's scary, people.
[01:13:41.490 --> 01:13:42.850]  Old police aren't like this.
[01:13:43.651 --> 01:13:46.812]  But more and more, whole departments are becoming criminal.
[01:13:47.592 --> 01:13:54.554]  And when that happens, you've got grade A tyranny, folks, where our own human species feeds on us as a prey animal.
[01:13:56.735 --> 01:13:57.776]  But they do it to white people.
[01:13:57.796 --> 01:13:58.716]  They do it to black people.
[01:13:59.514 --> 01:14:02.356]  You know, in the past decades it's been focused on poor people.
[01:14:02.677 --> 01:14:15.187]  That's why statistically it's more blacks and Hispanics and Asians that this happens to because they've been the minority group and easier to oppress and their socioeconomic level has been lower.
[01:14:16.128 --> 01:14:24.035]  Now in areas where it's predominantly Hispanic or black, we see the police feeding on disadvantaged blacks, whites, and Hispanics.
[01:14:24.804 --> 01:14:29.685]  Or where it's a majority Hispanic, we see them feeding on poor Hispanics and poor whites and poor blacks.
[01:14:29.725 --> 01:14:31.826]  So, again, it's the face of evil.
[01:14:32.766 --> 01:14:39.548]  Let's go ahead and talk now to Kelly Rushing, who was found not guilty.
[01:14:40.748 --> 01:14:49.731]  The jury said, no, it's not a terroristic threat to give a police officer a critically acclaimed video exposing corruption or a C-SPAN video.
[01:14:50.635 --> 01:14:51.416]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:12.101]  Good.
[01:15:12.121 --> 01:15:21.444]  I want to tell you that the complaints are being prepared on this judge now because by not dismissing it, he's under judicial review now for judicial misconduct.
[01:15:22.225 --> 01:15:36.690]  And I want you to know that though we had a victory here, in a way it's still a defeat, showing how crazy the local authorities, officials are, thinking that they would put you in jail for giving someone a video.
[01:15:37.330 --> 01:15:39.891]  Yeah, just because you win a battle don't mean the war is over.
[01:15:42.379 --> 01:15:47.421]  I mean, it shows how un-American... I mean, these people don't know their head from a hole in the ground.
[01:15:48.382 --> 01:15:53.084]  No, there's a great deal of, you know, misunderstandings.
[01:15:53.584 --> 01:15:54.665]  Kelly, I have to be honest with you.
[01:15:54.685 --> 01:16:09.231]  When I called you last night to see how it went, you told me you walked over and told the state police moron, Trooper Dobb, you told him, a guy I didn't know what the First Amendment is, you told him, I'm sorry about the trouble.
[01:16:11.228 --> 01:16:14.310]  No, I said, well, I'm sorry that it was a bother to you.
[01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:16.532]  But, I mean, they should have apologized to you.
[01:16:16.552 --> 01:16:18.373]  Yeah, probably so.
[01:16:18.393 --> 01:16:20.815]  You need to sue him now that you've been found not guilty.
[01:16:22.316 --> 01:16:24.257]  Listen, Kelly, that's official oppression.
[01:16:25.558 --> 01:16:27.379]  That's official oppression and false arrest.
[01:16:27.819 --> 01:16:32.062]  That county, that state owes you at least $500,000.
[01:16:32.342 --> 01:16:35.304]  That's the bare minimum judgment.
[01:16:36.505 --> 01:16:44.386]  You know, the state police got arrested, not arrested, got convicted for arresting people who were protesting out in front of the governor's mansion on public streets.
[01:16:44.646 --> 01:16:46.627]  They lost three separate lawsuits.
[01:16:46.967 --> 01:16:50.047]  Let me tell you, you get the right lawyer, buddy, you got a big fat win.
[01:16:50.567 --> 01:16:54.488]  Yeah, yeah, well, you know.
[01:16:54.648 --> 01:17:00.349]  Look, look, you need to sue him, you need to sue that judge, you need to sue the state.
[01:17:00.669 --> 01:17:05.170]  Because they are dangerous to our republic in the capacities they're in.
[01:17:06.798 --> 01:17:08.079]  Oh, yeah.
[01:17:08.139 --> 01:17:11.061]  A lot of it has to do with being uninformed.
[01:17:11.081 --> 01:17:13.362]  They tried to put you in jail for a year, buddy.
[01:17:14.302 --> 01:17:16.324]  What would that have done to your life, your finances?
[01:17:16.824 --> 01:17:24.248]  Oh, well, it just... They came against you viciously, hatefully, insanely.
[01:17:24.308 --> 01:17:26.810]  You need to do a public service and sue them.
[01:17:26.850 --> 01:17:29.211]  Are you going to sue them?
[01:17:29.752 --> 01:17:30.752]  Yeah, I'm thinking about it.
[01:17:33.174 --> 01:17:35.475]  Well, if you don't sue them, they're going to keep doing it to other people.
[01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:38.081]  Yeah.
[01:17:38.241 --> 01:17:43.343]  And just as I helped you because you helped our country, you need to help the country now by suing them.
[01:17:44.743 --> 01:17:48.044]  Well, it really isn't... Look, you're too nice.
[01:17:48.104 --> 01:17:49.705]  I talk to your neighbors, I talk to your family.
[01:17:49.725 --> 01:17:50.725]  You're too nice, Kelly.
[01:17:51.066 --> 01:17:54.687]  You're a nice person, no criminal record, a good American, a good Christian.
[01:17:55.167 --> 01:17:55.547]  Okay?
[01:17:56.468 --> 01:17:58.468]  And you apologize to him?
[01:17:58.768 --> 01:17:59.929]  You need to sue him.
[01:17:59.969 --> 01:18:01.389]  He needs to be off the force.
[01:18:03.010 --> 01:18:05.591]  Well, yeah, well...
[01:18:07.513 --> 01:18:08.493]  I don't know, Alex.
[01:18:08.533 --> 01:18:14.995]  You try to find proper balance in some of this stuff and it's extremely hard.
[01:18:15.015 --> 01:18:16.335]  I don't know what you're going to do.
[01:18:16.475 --> 01:18:20.436]  If they decide to have some retribution against you, then you might be wishing you to sue them.
[01:18:21.836 --> 01:18:22.216]  Yeah.
[01:18:23.877 --> 01:18:34.019]  Well, I would like to redeem what money it cost me for a lawyer and everything and time off from work and what have you.
[01:18:34.039 --> 01:18:34.419]  Well, good.
[01:18:36.935 --> 01:18:38.175]  I feel I'm entitled to that.
[01:18:38.235 --> 01:18:40.496]  I don't feel that I'm entitled to... You're entitled to $500,000.
[01:18:40.556 --> 01:18:47.378]  Well, that's basically a taxpayer's money, though, Alex.
[01:18:47.618 --> 01:18:49.718]  Sir, that'll ensure he loses his job.
[01:18:50.438 --> 01:18:52.139]  That'll ensure that judge is removed.
[01:18:53.279 --> 01:18:54.759]  Yeah.
[01:18:54.799 --> 01:19:01.401]  Well, then that... You know, then it's going to cost more money to do that, and I'm not a rich person.
[01:19:01.421 --> 01:19:03.602]  No, you can get a lawyer to take it for a third.
[01:19:03.622 --> 01:19:03.702]  Yeah.
[01:19:06.263 --> 01:19:07.884]  You want me to give your number out for lawyers?
[01:19:09.225 --> 01:19:15.609]  Um, well, I don't know, Alex.
[01:19:15.689 --> 01:19:20.091]  I'm just going to have to kind of think about it all for a while.
[01:19:20.111 --> 01:19:21.672]  Well, I think that's good, Kelly.
[01:19:21.872 --> 01:19:23.353]  No, I think thinking about it's good.
[01:19:27.516 --> 01:19:27.916]  Yeah.
[01:19:28.396 --> 01:19:30.577]  Kelly, are you glad that you didn't plea bargain?
[01:19:32.552 --> 01:19:33.813]  Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm glad.
[01:19:33.853 --> 01:19:35.854]  Well, I didn't feel I was guilty of anything, really.
[01:19:37.175 --> 01:19:39.897]  Why should I plea bargain something that you're not guilty of, you know?
[01:19:40.897 --> 01:19:42.998]  Well, Kelly, God bless you, and I'm glad you stood strong.
[01:19:43.038 --> 01:19:43.599]  Anything else?
[01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:50.463]  Well, I'd just like to say that everyone needs to... Tell you what, stay there, stay there.
[01:19:52.336 --> 01:20:03.059]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.

[01:20:10.902 --> 01:20:12.403]  The system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:20:27.037 --> 01:20:30.919]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:20:30.959 --> 01:20:32.860]  The water level is always visible.
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:39.004]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.

[01:20:52.351 --> 01:20:54.712]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:20:54.972 --> 01:20:58.814]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:20:59.134 --> 01:20:59.955]  Read the labels.
[01:21:00.375 --> 01:21:04.517]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:21:04.717 --> 01:21:08.899]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:21:09.279 --> 01:21:14.161]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.

[01:21:51.764 --> 01:21:55.566]  Hi, this is Jack Browning with a special offer to listeners of GCN Radio.

[01:22:03.109 --> 01:22:04.590]  Take control of your own destiny.
[01:22:04.810 --> 01:22:09.252]  GCN is contracted with Midas Resources for copies of the Citizen's Rulebook.
[01:22:09.432 --> 01:22:10.712]  This is more than a handbook.
[01:22:10.732 --> 01:22:14.234]  It is your guide to a freer life with less governmental interference.
[01:22:14.614 --> 01:22:15.315]  Here's the deal.
[01:22:15.555 --> 01:22:26.809]  Call MRI at 800-686-2237 and obtain two handbooks, one for yourself, one for a friend, and two silver dollars for just $24.95, shipping included.
[01:22:27.049 --> 01:22:32.977]  More than half these coins were melted under the Pittman Act of 1918 and later with a great silver run of the 70s and 80s.
[01:22:34.418 --> 01:22:39.240]  There are less than one of these coins surviving for every 20 persons in the United States.
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:43.442]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[01:22:43.802 --> 01:22:45.643]  Ask for the Freedom Handbook Special.
[01:22:46.043 --> 01:22:50.224]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.

[01:23:52.711 --> 01:23:55.453]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:23:55.473 --> 01:23:59.416]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:02.479 --> 01:24:04.040]  Alright my friends, back live.
[01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:05.121]  Paul Watson coming up.
[01:24:05.161 --> 01:24:06.362]  More of your calls as well.
[01:24:06.422 --> 01:24:07.903]  A bunch of lone gunmen clips.
[01:24:08.563 --> 01:24:11.686]  Interesting 9-11 information contained therein.
[01:24:13.527 --> 01:24:15.248]  And right now we're talking to Kelly Rushing.
[01:24:15.929 --> 01:24:22.294]  Found not guilty of terrorist threats for giving a police officer a video trying to inform him in a gentlemanly fashion.
[01:24:22.981 --> 01:24:32.404]  And Kelly, such a nice guy, he walked over and says sorry about all the bother when it was the so-called state police officer that caused the whole problem to begin with.
[01:24:32.644 --> 01:24:42.988]  I want to thank all the listeners that called the courthouse there in Lynam County and also called the state police because a lot of people talked to the state police and they said, oh, he's just young and doesn't know what he's doing.
[01:24:43.048 --> 01:24:45.349]  Yeah, it's something else.
[01:24:46.215 --> 01:24:49.236]  Some of them were pretty smart-mouthed, but some of them obviously are good people.
[01:24:49.736 --> 01:24:52.797]  And I'd imagine that he's going to get teased quite a bit now, which is a good thing.
[01:24:52.837 --> 01:24:53.657]  He needs to be taught.
[01:24:53.677 --> 01:24:57.118]  At the bare minimum, he should have apologized to Kelly.
[01:24:57.458 --> 01:25:00.959]  If he would have apologized to Kelly, I wouldn't be saying he should get fired.
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:03.160]  Though he really still should be.
[01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:04.860]  But he didn't apologize to Kelly.
[01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:06.461]  Kelly did to him, which is pretty...
[01:25:07.421 --> 01:25:08.262]  Nice of Kelly.
[01:25:08.442 --> 01:25:12.045]  It's like somebody punches you in the face and you apologize to them.
[01:25:12.345 --> 01:25:14.586]  Kelly, your final comments.
[01:25:15.087 --> 01:25:23.753]  Well, I'd just like to say that most things that happen, I think, between all of us is usually a misunderstanding.
[01:25:24.694 --> 01:25:35.122]  And until things can be brought out forward and people can have enough compassion for each other to bring them out and talk openly to each other,
[01:25:36.018 --> 01:25:39.683]  I don't think that we'll ever be able to stop the New World Order.
[01:25:40.644 --> 01:25:45.091]  You know, our forebearers knew it quite well, united we stand and divided we fall.
[01:25:45.111 --> 01:25:50.579]  Until people realized that we're Americans and what America...
[01:25:51.317 --> 01:25:57.078]  Well, in Russia they arrest you for giving a video to a police officer.
[01:25:57.238 --> 01:25:58.279]  In America, you don't.
[01:25:58.539 --> 01:26:01.660]  And I think Trooper Dobbs should move to Russia.
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:09.101]  Kelly, keep us abreast of the situation as it develops, and God bless you, and I'm glad that we could help you out, and thanks for passing the videos out.
[01:26:09.361 --> 01:26:12.662]  Well, I'd like to thank everyone for their support, Alex.
[01:26:13.402 --> 01:26:16.063]  And I appreciate, you know, everything that everybody's done.
[01:26:16.970 --> 01:26:17.872]  You too, Alex.
[01:26:17.952 --> 01:26:19.436]  I appreciate everything you're doing.
[01:26:19.577 --> 01:26:21.582]  Well, I appreciate you, and I also want to thank...
[01:26:22.581 --> 01:26:25.503]  Mr. Farley over at the Court Watchers Association.
[01:26:26.063 --> 01:26:27.444]  Yeah, yeah, him too.
[01:26:28.184 --> 01:26:32.126]  He did a great job, and I think he's going to be filing a judicial complaint on this judge.
[01:26:32.826 --> 01:26:33.987]  But God bless you and take care.
[01:26:34.007 --> 01:26:35.127]  Okay, you too, Alex.
[01:26:35.367 --> 01:26:36.548]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[01:26:36.568 --> 01:26:37.608]  Let's go back to the calls.
[01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:41.891]  Let's go ahead and talk to, I guess, Ron in New York's up next.
[01:26:41.991 --> 01:26:42.751]  Ron, go ahead.
[01:26:42.771 --> 01:26:43.691]  Hi, Alex.
[01:26:44.052 --> 01:26:44.372]  Hello.
[01:26:44.992 --> 01:26:47.373]  Alex, two things I wanted to discuss with you today.
[01:26:47.813 --> 01:26:48.454]  One came up.
[01:26:48.674 --> 01:26:50.795]  I was actually perusing today's New York Post.
[01:26:51.511 --> 01:26:55.513]  And on page six of the New York Post, there's a picture of George W.'
[01:26:55.493 --> 01:26:56.173]  's two daughters.
[01:26:56.734 --> 01:27:00.195]  They went with him to Fort Hood to give out some medals yesterday.
[01:27:00.596 --> 01:27:04.377]  You have to see this photograph if you have any way of pulling that up on the website.
[01:27:05.458 --> 01:27:11.361]  They look completely disinterested, and one of them has probably one of the cruelest looks on her face that I've ever seen.
[01:27:12.176 --> 01:27:18.765]  Of any photograph of any member of a first family since the Kennedy administration, you've got to take a look at it and you'll see what I mean.
[01:27:18.805 --> 01:27:21.168]  It's the one in the dungaree jacket with the darker hair.
[01:27:21.709 --> 01:27:22.550]  I think it's Barbara.
[01:27:22.930 --> 01:27:23.531]  Barbara Bush.
[01:27:23.912 --> 01:27:26.495]  The younger, of course, when I'm talking about Mother Barbara.
[01:27:27.437 --> 01:27:28.538]  It's unbelievable photos.
[01:27:28.598 --> 01:27:29.900]  Now, on the page before that...
[01:27:31.081 --> 01:27:39.248]  You have on page five of the Post four young ladies, approximately in the same age category, all serving in Iraq, and one of them was killed.
[01:27:39.748 --> 01:27:40.729]  Yeah, three sisters.
[01:27:41.070 --> 01:27:41.290]  Yes.
[01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:42.351]  Well, there's only three now.
[01:27:42.411 --> 01:27:43.412]  There were four, I believe.
[01:27:44.813 --> 01:27:45.854]  And one was killed in Iraq.
[01:27:46.846 --> 01:27:47.566]  What a difference.
[01:27:48.107 --> 01:28:00.473]  Take a look at those two photographs and compare the difference between simple, decent people from the heartland, and you take a look at the picture of GW's two daughters, and you'll see the contrast, and you'll understand what I mean without saying.
[01:28:00.753 --> 01:28:13.199]  Well, I've got to tell you, and we had a video camera in the car, but I didn't videotape them because I'm going to leave the president's brood alone, but I was at a 40th birthday for some friends a few years ago, and we were seated right next to them.
[01:28:15.246 --> 01:28:19.108]  And after I got done shaking the federal marshal's hands, who were all fans, I said, who's inside?
[01:28:19.128 --> 01:28:19.988]  They said, we can't tell you.
[01:28:20.028 --> 01:28:21.168]  I go inside and it's them.
[01:28:21.709 --> 01:28:24.310]  And they were completely drunk, being rude to the waitress.
[01:28:25.570 --> 01:28:31.992]  There were two guys who looked like heavy metal Satanists or something.
[01:28:32.753 --> 01:28:34.593]  And they were something else.
[01:28:34.633 --> 01:28:37.955]  And my buddy Kevin said, man, let's shoot some video of them drunk.
[01:28:38.015 --> 01:28:39.615]  And I said, are you stupid?
[01:28:40.276 --> 01:28:43.717]  I said, that would be signing your death warrant.
[01:28:44.406 --> 01:28:51.188]  I'm not going to mess with the president's children, but they are pretty hateful creatures.
[01:28:51.868 --> 01:28:57.269]  You take a look at that photograph in today's New York Post on page 6, and it'll speak a thousand words for itself.
[01:28:57.489 --> 01:29:06.111]  Well, anybody that's rude to waitresses, anybody that's rude to people that... I mean, if somebody's rude to me, I'll be rude to them, but they're just little lords.
[01:29:06.131 --> 01:29:07.031]  I mean, that's what they are.
[01:29:08.731 --> 01:29:11.532]  Raised to be precocious brats, as simple as that.
[01:29:12.683 --> 01:29:15.645]  Yeah, but, I mean, in the aggregate, I don't think it's that important.
[01:29:15.965 --> 01:29:16.546]  No, it's not.
[01:29:16.646 --> 01:29:22.530]  It's just that I find that ironic, because on page five you have one group, and on page six another.
[01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.910]  You'll see.
[01:29:22.930 --> 01:29:25.532]  Hey, what do you think of Kelly rushing being found not guilty?
[01:29:26.352 --> 01:29:40.041]  Well, I think it was the right decision, but I think he's a little bit too relaxed and apathetic in his response to pursue justice for himself and to establish a pattern so this sort of thing doesn't occur again for the next innocent person down the road.
[01:29:40.061 --> 01:29:40.621]  Amen to that.
[01:29:40.682 --> 01:29:41.242]  Amen to that.
[01:29:42.381 --> 01:29:43.264]  We're on the march.
[01:29:43.766 --> 01:29:45.371]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:46.314 --> 01:29:49.002]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:54.545 --> 01:30:00.049]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:30:00.449 --> 01:30:04.692]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:30:04.932 --> 01:30:11.957]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:30:12.338 --> 01:30:18.462]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:30:18.582 --> 01:30:19.803]  There are no side effects.
[01:30:19.943 --> 01:30:22.165]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:30:36.918 --> 01:30:40.062]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.

[01:30:41.383 --> 01:30:41.583]  Call today.
[01:30:51.989 --> 01:30:58.211]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:30:58.371 --> 01:31:04.534]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:31:04.814 --> 01:31:13.257]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:31:13.497 --> 01:31:20.520]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:25.643]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:31:25.863 --> 01:31:31.267]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:31:31.607 --> 01:31:34.689]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:42.935]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:31:43.035 --> 01:31:43.615]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:53.101]  It's finally here.
[01:31:53.221 --> 01:31:54.201]  Spring has arrived.
[01:31:54.401 --> 01:31:57.361]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:31:57.581 --> 01:32:01.042]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:32:01.242 --> 01:32:09.404]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can too with the help of the ARC Institute's brand new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[01:32:09.664 --> 01:32:13.385]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[01:32:13.605 --> 01:32:18.626]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[01:32:18.906 --> 01:32:23.409]  Ark's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[01:32:23.609 --> 01:32:27.672]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.

[01:32:44.163 --> 01:32:45.164]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:45.204 --> 01:32:46.365]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:18.969 --> 01:33:19.989]  Alright, my friends.
[01:33:20.890 --> 01:33:23.911]  We've now gone a little bit over the halfway point, the meridian.
[01:33:25.291 --> 01:33:36.655]  Here on the broadcast today, I know that we have got loaded phone lines with Sandra and Chris and Rhonda and Chris and many, many others, Charles and others that are patiently holding.
[01:33:36.675 --> 01:33:47.019]  We'll get to your calls before this hour ends, but I want to bring up Paul Joseph Watson, who is normally with us on Mondays, but he's been on with us on Tuesdays as of late.
[01:33:47.842 --> 01:33:50.164]  And he's the webmaster for PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:33:50.204 --> 01:33:56.507]  He's written a book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and the New World Order, available through the websites as well.
[01:33:56.988 --> 01:34:00.170]  And I always enjoy his insightful commentary.
[01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:04.953]  Our minds are very similar on our view of the global matrix of control.
[01:34:05.753 --> 01:34:09.095]  And to give us the news that he thinks is most important is Paul Watson.
[01:34:09.816 --> 01:34:13.358]  Paul, before we get to your top stories, though, I want to air these clips off The Lone Gunman.
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:20.206]  And for those that aren't aware of this, why is this important, and what are they about to hear?
[01:34:20.466 --> 01:34:22.068]  Describe this, set this up for them.
[01:34:24.130 --> 01:34:28.414]  Episode of a, it was an X-Files spin-off, basically.
[01:34:28.434 --> 01:34:31.357]  It was made by the same people, and it aired in March of 2001.
[01:34:32.981 --> 01:34:41.425]  And the basic premise of the storyline throughout the whole series is about a group of individuals who try and expose government corruption.
[01:34:41.946 --> 01:34:46.168]  And in this particular pilot episode, the script revolves around
[01:34:46.934 --> 01:35:05.271]  Them discovering a secret plot called Scenario 12D, which involves the government crashing a plane into the World Trade Center to be blamed on foreign terrorists to enable increased arms sales, empire expansion, and a police state at home.
[01:35:05.311 --> 01:35:07.453]  And remember, this is months before 9-11.
[01:35:07.714 --> 01:35:08.294]  This is March 2001.
[01:35:10.638 --> 01:35:12.599]  And it's not just any network doing it.
[01:35:12.819 --> 01:35:26.467]  It's Fox, who has the contract to break down the family, to show male figures always in a bad light, to have the prostitution shows where the women beg for the man, the most degenerate stuff on the so-called conservative TV network.
[01:35:27.731 --> 01:35:30.513]  And we've got this clip, and for historical reasons we'll air it.
[01:35:30.573 --> 01:35:36.317]  I mean, it has a small amount of mild language, but it's historical for the record, so we can't edit it.
[01:35:36.958 --> 01:35:38.178]  But it is extremely mild.
[01:35:38.919 --> 01:35:41.561]  There's some parts of the show we cannot air because it's not mild.
[01:35:42.581 --> 01:35:44.743]  But there's several clips that we're going to air.
[01:35:45.263 --> 01:35:47.445]  But, Paul, this isn't happening in a vacuum.
[01:35:47.665 --> 01:35:50.167]  The globalists put out lots of their calling cards.
[01:35:50.627 --> 01:35:54.490]  What were some of the other calling cards before 9-11, and why do they do this?
[01:35:55.794 --> 01:35:56.514]  Well, there were several.
[01:35:56.534 --> 01:36:01.997]  There were many calendars published in the Middle East which showed airliners coming down in the middle of Manhattan.
[01:36:02.497 --> 01:36:13.762]  There were CD covers of albums, not just the one that everyone remembers by the coup, where it shows the South Tower exploding, but also others which show planes heading south.
[01:36:14.402 --> 01:36:15.603]  Towards the World Trade Center.
[01:36:16.084 --> 01:36:30.856]  So why they do it is anyone's guess, but from my point of view, it's kind of conditioning the consensus matrix of the population to accept, you know, steel buildings collapsing when it's completely unprecedented.
[01:36:30.876 --> 01:36:43.646]  There was some kind of acceptance on 9-11 that this had been coming all along, and you have to ask why people thought that, and it's because they were laying the groundwork for this to happen through these kind of fictional presentations.
[01:36:43.928 --> 01:36:45.422]  And then at the very same time...
[01:36:46.713 --> 01:36:47.953]  That all of this is happening.
[01:36:48.493 --> 01:36:52.554]  Rice says no one in government had ever heard of such a thing.
[01:36:53.014 --> 01:37:02.376]  Forget 50-plus mainstream articles, government documents, the White House ordering FBI agents in Illinois and Arizona and Texas not to stop the hijackers' plans.
[01:37:02.636 --> 01:37:05.797]  Then it turns out the hijackers are still alive, trained at U.S.
[01:37:05.857 --> 01:37:12.578]  military bases, NORAD standing down, public officials being told not to fly, and they still have the nerve, Paul.
[01:37:12.598 --> 01:37:14.159]  I mean, you've been watching this commission.
[01:37:14.199 --> 01:37:15.139]  What do you make of this commission?
[01:37:16.263 --> 01:37:30.583]  Well, basically, obviously it works on many levels, but the main level that I'm seeing emerging for it is to reinforce the official version of events that this was carried out by 19 Arabs, hijackers.
[01:37:30.623 --> 01:37:31.885]  You remember we reported that
[01:37:32.826 --> 01:37:40.709]  One of the few members to resign from the commission resigned because he said, you know, I cannot foresee how 19 Arabs could have carried out this attack.
[01:37:41.089 --> 01:37:48.011]  So we get the release of the presidential briefing a few days ago with the title, you know, Bin Laden determined to attack in the USA.
[01:37:48.031 --> 01:37:52.933]  So it's about reinforcing the notion that this was all the work of Bin Laden.
[01:37:52.973 --> 01:37:55.174]  So it's a kind of distraction from the real reason.
[01:37:55.254 --> 01:37:59.415]  And by the way, to keep you safe, we need to get all your freedoms, John Ashcroft said.
[01:37:59.735 --> 01:38:01.616]  Support the Patriot Act and...
[01:38:02.456 --> 01:38:06.560]  And on top of it, you need to give us a domestic CIA.
[01:38:07.501 --> 01:38:08.682]  Well, that's the point.
[01:38:09.262 --> 01:38:18.411]  The argument that this was somehow a failure of intelligence or communication is defeated by the very fact that nobody was fired in its aftermath.
[01:38:18.511 --> 01:38:26.558]  And we had people like Ben Venista, as you mentioned, just a few days ago on the weekend, call for a domestic CIA, basically, to watch Americans.
[01:38:26.778 --> 01:38:27.799]  And then notice, he was...
[01:38:29.338 --> 01:38:29.918]  Well, exactly.
[01:38:29.958 --> 01:38:31.879]  And then you've got Philip Zelikow.
[01:38:48.017 --> 01:38:55.279]  Testifying to his own commission, because he was involved in the cover-up, and also working with Condoleezza Rice in 1995, publishing her book.
[01:38:55.299 --> 01:39:00.480]  So you've got people, liberals and conservatives, whitewashing from both administrations.
[01:39:00.820 --> 01:39:03.120]  And then four members of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:39:03.641 --> 01:39:14.623]  Let's play that clip we aired earlier, and for those that just joined us, this is from the Lone Gunman series, and this is where the son is talking to his father, who's a high-level NSA officer.
[01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:21.047]  And Byers is surprised by his father as he goes through the house looking for clues to his disappearance.
[01:39:21.087 --> 01:39:26.734]  His father is less happy to be found, knowing that Overlord will use his son to find him.
[01:39:27.555 --> 01:39:40.900]  Confronting his father with his suspicions that scenario 12D is connected to his disappearance, Byers learns of an impending stage terror action, the bombing of a domestic airliner.
[01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:46.722]  Then the next clip, they learn that it's to be the World Trade Center at the corner of Liberty and Washington.
[01:39:46.782 --> 01:39:51.604]  So here's that first clip, aired months before 9-11.
[01:39:52.244 --> 01:39:52.645]  Here it is.
[01:39:53.765 --> 01:39:56.046]  Go ahead and hit that first one, Stephanie.
[01:39:56.846 --> 01:39:57.987]  Scenario 12D.
[01:39:58.107 --> 01:39:59.968]  Perhaps the computer isn't playing today.
[01:40:00.608 --> 01:40:05.511]  We know it's a war game scenario and it has to do with airline counter-terrorism.
[01:40:06.912 --> 01:40:08.333]  Why is it important enough to kill for?
[01:40:09.073 --> 01:40:10.454]  Because it's no longer a game.
[01:40:12.395 --> 01:40:18.999]  But if some terrorist group wants to act out this scenario, why target you for assassination?
[01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:21.081]  Depends on who your terrorists are.
[01:40:23.182 --> 01:40:24.743]  The men who conceived of it in the first place.
[01:40:27.284 --> 01:40:30.867]  You're saying our government plans to commit a terrorist act against a domestic heirloom?
[01:40:30.887 --> 01:40:31.328]  There you go.
[01:40:31.708 --> 01:40:33.430]  Endangering the entire government, as usual.
[01:40:33.450 --> 01:40:34.631]  It's a faction.
[01:40:34.951 --> 01:40:36.172]  A small faction.
[01:40:36.192 --> 01:40:37.173]  What possible gain?
[01:40:38.194 --> 01:40:39.715]  The Cold War's over, John.
[01:40:40.396 --> 01:40:43.499]  But with no clear enemy to stockpile against, the arms market's flat.
[01:40:44.099 --> 01:40:53.668]  But bring down a fully loaded 727 into the middle of New York City, and you'll find a dozen tin-pot dictators all over the world just clamoring to take responsibility.
[01:40:54.599 --> 01:40:56.160]  I'm begging to be smart-bombed.
[01:40:56.620 --> 01:40:57.440]  I can't believe it.
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:40:59.661]  This is about increasing our sales.
[01:41:01.842 --> 01:41:02.042]  When?
[01:41:03.003 --> 01:41:03.343]  Tonight.
[01:41:03.643 --> 01:41:04.783]  Okay, that's good.
[01:41:04.923 --> 01:41:07.364]  How are you going to stop them?
[01:41:08.625 --> 01:41:09.925]  Why didn't you tell the world this?
[01:41:10.206 --> 01:41:10.746]  Go to the press!
[01:41:10.766 --> 01:41:11.186]  Stephanie, that's good.
[01:41:11.206 --> 01:41:13.987]  You think that she'll be drawing breath 30 minutes after I made that call?
[01:41:14.627 --> 01:41:15.168]  The press?
[01:41:15.628 --> 01:41:16.648]  Who's going to run this story?
[01:41:16.948 --> 01:41:17.429]  We would.
[01:41:17.689 --> 01:41:17.889]  This?
[01:41:21.371 --> 01:41:22.151]  Okay, okay.
[01:41:22.551 --> 01:41:23.051]  There you go.
[01:41:23.152 --> 01:41:37.055]  And then he starts getting into some discussions of why don't we post it in our newspaper, The Lone Gunman, their conspiracy newspaper, and he says, well, because it's full of space aliens and stuff, and that discredits it.
[01:41:38.256 --> 01:41:40.496]  And so we played that clip in full earlier.
[01:41:40.516 --> 01:41:41.616]  We just played part of it then.
[01:41:42.557 --> 01:41:46.998]  Now, notice that also, and you can download the whole
[01:41:48.635 --> 01:41:49.996]  45-minute long TV show.
[01:41:50.036 --> 01:41:52.719]  I mean, it's an hour, but with the commercials out, it's 45 minutes long.
[01:41:52.739 --> 01:41:59.024]  You can download the whole thing on the website if you go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com and link through to the site that's posted the whole thing.
[01:41:59.064 --> 01:42:02.547]  We've posted clips before, but they've posted the whole thing, and we're trying to cull through it.
[01:42:02.607 --> 01:42:04.970]  Now, he finds out about it.
[01:42:04.990 --> 01:42:11.976]  The publisher, the lone gunman, the son of the top spy, finds out that there's a government scenario to fly the jet in the building.
[01:42:12.634 --> 01:42:14.956]  But then his father says, no, it's not just a scenario.
[01:42:15.297 --> 01:42:26.588]  Now, Paul, on 9-11, they were running a CIA drill of doing just that, and everybody else in the government thought it was just a drill, and that's what enabled NORAD to stand down.
[01:42:26.688 --> 01:42:27.269]  Comment on that.
[01:42:28.197 --> 01:42:29.098]  Well, yeah, that's the case.
[01:42:30.239 --> 01:42:36.443]  When they first discover the plan, they just discover the basic details to do with counterterrorism.
[01:42:36.563 --> 01:42:40.667]  So it's dressed up as a kind of drill, which is what happened on 9-11.
[01:42:40.687 --> 01:42:46.071]  But when they crack the deeper details of it, they actually find out that it's an inside job.
[01:42:46.551 --> 01:42:49.213]  Also, I mean, I watched the whole program many months ago.
[01:42:49.233 --> 01:42:52.236]  The plane takes off from Boston Logan as well.
[01:42:52.716 --> 01:42:57.940]  There are many similarities to the actual event, which are not in just these short clips that we're playing.
[01:42:58.724 --> 01:43:07.666]  But some people have speculated that it was kind of a desperate attempt to blow the whistle on the fact that this was an upcoming, you know, agenda.
[01:43:07.686 --> 01:43:09.287]  So that's another perspective on it.
[01:43:09.927 --> 01:43:19.430]  So throughout the whole program, though, not just these clips, there are many little things which suggest that somebody on the inside had some knowledge of what was about to take place.
[01:43:20.290 --> 01:43:24.911]  But Condoleezza Rice had said no one had ever imagined this had never been thought of.
[01:43:25.706 --> 01:43:29.768]  Well, Bojinka in 95 was about flying planes into buildings.
[01:43:30.868 --> 01:43:34.930]  In 93, there was a plan to fly a plane into the Eiffel Tower.
[01:43:35.631 --> 01:43:41.293]  Before that, in 91, somebody tried to fly a smaller plane into the White House.
[01:43:41.834 --> 01:43:47.356]  So, I mean, even from a perspective of a Hollywood production, people had thought of it.
[01:43:47.436 --> 01:43:53.239]  So for Condoleezza Rice to lie and say that she hadn't thought of it is, frankly, unbelievable.
[01:43:54.207 --> 01:43:56.329]  All right, let's go ahead and go to the next clip.
[01:43:56.349 --> 01:43:57.089]  Are we ready with that?
[01:44:00.632 --> 01:44:02.393]  Ah, I thought something was going on.
[01:44:02.654 --> 01:44:09.779]  Murphy's Law, about once a month, the computer they play clips off of has a brain problem, and that just happened.
[01:44:09.799 --> 01:44:14.883]  So we'll play that clip a little bit later where they talk about it being the World Trade Center.
[01:44:15.864 --> 01:44:18.926]  Now, Paul, there's a bunch of different news items here.
[01:44:19.547 --> 01:44:21.228]  What do you think is most important right now?
[01:44:22.395 --> 01:44:23.920]  Well, it's obviously Iraq at the moment.
[01:44:24.301 --> 01:44:26.709]  I was on the show last week saying that...
[01:44:27.381 --> 01:44:34.402]  The neocons were foaming at the mouth and screaming for Fallujah to be flattened and that's exactly what took place.
[01:44:34.802 --> 01:44:40.123]  We've got approaching a thousand dead Iraqis now and at least 70 dead US troops.
[01:44:40.844 --> 01:44:43.544]  We've got hostages being taken left, right and centre.
[01:44:44.024 --> 01:44:49.185]  Interesting thing with the Japanese hostages where the stories flip-flop from day to day.
[01:44:49.305 --> 01:44:52.706]  One day they're going to be killed, the next they're going to be released but nothing's happened yet.
[01:44:53.226 --> 01:45:00.108]  It's interesting that those Japanese hostages were in Iraq to research the effects of depleted uranium.
[01:45:00.188 --> 01:45:02.929]  They were doing a massively sponsored study on that.
[01:45:03.149 --> 01:45:06.951]  And then magically they get captured by guys in black ski masks.
[01:45:07.491 --> 01:45:10.512]  Yeah, so whether they're killed... And they're the group not being released.
[01:45:11.312 --> 01:45:14.833]  So whether they're killed or they go home, you know, that research gets shut down.
[01:45:14.893 --> 01:45:16.074]  So who benefits from that?
[01:45:16.134 --> 01:45:18.234]  Certainly not the Iraqis.
[01:45:18.955 --> 01:45:20.115]  But in a wider context...
[01:45:21.027 --> 01:45:26.151]  There's been another report, and this is the benefit of reading Iranian newspapers at 1 a.m.
[01:45:26.211 --> 01:45:28.072]  in the morning.
[01:45:28.152 --> 01:45:30.014]  Which we found to be very accurate in the past.
[01:45:30.454 --> 01:45:36.298]  Well, yeah, I always used Iranian newspapers during the war because they hated both Iraqis and the Americans.
[01:45:37.019 --> 01:45:39.161]  The axes to grind cancelled out each other.
[01:45:39.561 --> 01:45:42.143]  But the Tehran Times reported last night...
[01:45:42.783 --> 01:45:51.131]  That these hostilities are being used as a distraction while weapons of mass destruction are being planted in southern and western Iraq.
[01:45:51.838 --> 01:45:54.939]  Now, last time it was the people inside the Governing Council.
[01:46:21.016 --> 01:46:22.919]  Yeah, and sources close to them.
[01:46:23.340 --> 01:46:35.718]  So they're now saying that they're using these hostilities to divert attention away from the planting and then later discovery of these weapons to be announced months before the election.
[01:46:38.001 --> 01:46:41.923]  Okay, we'll go back into Iraq and then do some calls here in just a few minutes, folks.
[01:46:42.003 --> 01:46:44.844]  Right now, let's go to this next clip, also from a lone gunman.
[01:46:45.405 --> 01:46:49.787]  Again, airing, what, six months or five months before 9-11 took place.
[01:46:49.807 --> 01:46:59.011]  This is where they're trying to stop the remote control of the plane by the NSA, where they're trying to fly it into the World Trade Center.
[01:46:59.291 --> 01:47:00.352]  Let's go ahead and play that clip.
[01:47:02.136 --> 01:47:02.976]  Did you find anything?
[01:47:02.996 --> 01:47:04.797]  You know, let it hold clear if this thing can be trusted.
[01:47:04.837 --> 01:47:06.678]  But you don't make it with your erectus, do you?
[01:47:06.818 --> 01:47:09.439]  Are you absolutely sure that this is the targeted flight?
[01:47:09.459 --> 01:47:12.240]  This flight was chosen primarily for its visibility.
[01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:15.001]  It's scheduled to pass on Manhattan, ultimately to Boston.
[01:47:17.742 --> 01:47:21.383]  You said they intend to bring us down in the middle of New York City?
[01:47:23.344 --> 01:47:24.224]  What if there is no bomb?
[01:47:26.445 --> 01:47:27.546]  Well, how are they going to bring it down?
[01:47:27.566 --> 01:47:30.507]  The same way a dead man can drop a car.
[01:47:35.652 --> 01:47:36.713]  What do you mean, though, Bob?
[01:47:36.733 --> 01:47:46.639]  Langley, I need you to hack into the aircraft's onboard navigation system.
[01:47:46.659 --> 01:47:47.419]  We need to know where we're headed.
[01:47:47.439 --> 01:47:48.220]  Okay, go into headsets.
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:49.120]  I'll call in the Air Force carrier.
[01:47:49.140 --> 01:47:50.541]  Make them think we're sending a ground air fax.
[01:47:50.561 --> 01:47:51.121]  That's one twisted star 69.
[01:47:51.161 --> 01:47:53.203]  Well, just get ready to ride the wave, you people.
[01:47:53.223 --> 01:47:55.304]  Just get me on that plane and I'll get you autopilot access.
[01:47:55.364 --> 01:47:56.525]  How are you going to do that?
[01:47:56.765 --> 01:48:00.207]  Airline telemetry systems use processors similar to those found in TV radios.
[01:48:01.408 --> 01:48:01.608]  I'm in.
[01:48:01.628 --> 01:48:03.149]  We got ourselves a convoy.
[01:48:04.176 --> 01:48:04.837]  What's your progress?
[01:48:05.157 --> 01:48:07.079]  I've hacked into the flight control system output.
[01:48:07.339 --> 01:48:08.380]  You want that little bit of help?
[01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:09.641]  It's what the brains of the plane...
[01:48:12.384 --> 01:48:16.287]  So again, that's one of the clips where they're talking about how it's been taken over by remote control.
[01:48:16.367 --> 01:48:17.528]  There's not a bomb on board.
[01:48:17.788 --> 01:48:24.353]  The plane is the bomb, and it's actually the next clip where they talk about unscheduled flight into the World Trade Center.
[01:48:24.373 --> 01:48:28.517]  So we'll get that clip and play that for you as well.
[01:48:28.557 --> 01:48:32.319]  The plane is closing rapidly on the WTC North Tower.
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:39.145]  The pilot struggles vainly to override the remote control signal while Langley struggles to decrypt it.
[01:48:40.085 --> 01:48:47.691]  And they go on to plead with one of the other government people to give them the chip so they can break into it and reverse it.
[01:48:48.412 --> 01:48:51.114]  And there's a clip here where they talk about it being the World Trade Center.
[01:48:51.754 --> 01:48:57.779]  And then the plane narrowly misses and actually scrapes one of the antennas on top of the North Tower.
[01:48:59.068 --> 01:49:04.351]  Yeah, we know they're talking about remote control because you heard them mention, you know, how can a dead man drive a car?
[01:49:04.371 --> 01:49:14.796]  It's because earlier in the episode, they tried to kill this man's father by taking remote control of his car and driving it over a cliff.
[01:49:14.836 --> 01:49:18.838]  So they discovered that because they found the remote control device in the car.
[01:49:18.858 --> 01:49:22.260]  So that's why they're talking about remote control in this instance.
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:28.523]  And then indeed they hack in and again get the plane to not crash into the World Trade Center there in the last few seconds.
[01:49:30.180 --> 01:49:35.564]  And then magically, everybody's standing down because they think it's all a government drill, Paul.
[01:49:35.944 --> 01:49:37.225]  What happened on 9-11?
[01:49:37.265 --> 01:49:38.827]  What does the Associated Press say happened?
[01:49:39.687 --> 01:49:47.533]  Well, it says that there was a drill which involved crashing planes into government buildings, including the World Trade Center.
[01:49:48.153 --> 01:49:51.416]  And on top of that, talking about how Rice lied about it,
[01:49:52.068 --> 01:50:00.994]  There was a Pentagon plan which occurred in 2000, and it was on their own website, which talked about a plane being crashed into the Pentagon itself.
[01:50:01.554 --> 01:50:15.784]  So, again, to speculate that she hadn't foreseen it when they were doing drills on it a year before, and not just on the day of 9-11, but a year before with the Pentagon situation, again, it's another piece of, you know, it's another smoking gun.
[01:50:17.609 --> 01:50:23.714]  Now, Paul, we're going to break and come back and take some calls, but later in the next hour, what's some of the other news we're going to go over?
[01:50:23.734 --> 01:50:31.440]  We need to talk about the weapons of mass destruction propaganda, which has been coming out again in recent weeks.
[01:50:31.580 --> 01:50:39.607]  Cameras on school buses, more Big Brother, Cheney selling nukes to China, and many more stories.
[01:50:40.595 --> 01:50:42.016]  Alright, that's just some of what's coming up.
[01:50:42.076 --> 01:50:43.137]  First year calls.
[01:50:43.257 --> 01:50:44.558]  Ladies and gentlemen, we get back.
[01:50:44.618 --> 01:50:46.720]  I'm Alex Jones, joined by Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:50.663]  And again, he's the webmaster for my website, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:50:52.084 --> 01:50:56.407]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:56.607 --> 01:51:01.050]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:51:01.190 --> 01:51:05.574]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:51:05.614 --> 01:51:06.935]  The New World Order.
[01:51:08.715 --> 01:51:12.937]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:51:12.997 --> 01:51:19.939]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:51:20.059 --> 01:51:22.119]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:51:22.439 --> 01:51:32.783]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:51:33.063 --> 01:51:34.323]  If you want to understand what the new
[01:51:34.343 --> 01:51:34.543]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:51:34.583 --> 01:51:35.864]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:51:51.474 --> 01:51:58.999]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:51:59.279 --> 01:52:10.187]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:52:10.447 --> 01:52:12.268]  Yet require very little energy.
[01:52:12.528 --> 01:52:15.851]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:52:16.191 --> 01:52:26.638]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:52:26.938 --> 01:52:27.439]  That's right.
[01:52:27.619 --> 01:52:34.744]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:52:35.024 --> 01:52:43.770]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:52:43.830 --> 01:52:44.271]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:52:53.171 --> 01:52:59.114]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:59.334 --> 01:53:01.595]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:53:01.796 --> 01:53:08.139]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:53:08.519 --> 01:53:09.140]  I think so.
[01:53:24.031 --> 01:53:24.431]  We're good to go.
[01:53:52.950 --> 01:53:58.101]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:58.763 --> 01:54:01.047]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:54:03.895 --> 01:54:07.858]  All right, Chris and Rhonda and Charles, your calls are coming up here momentarily.
[01:54:08.358 --> 01:54:12.681]  The toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:54:13.121 --> 01:54:23.428]  We will air that clip a little bit later in its entirety as soon as we get the computer that never messes up, but seems to every once in a while, I guess, up and going, the computer we got the clips on.
[01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:28.562]  Look, there's a whole stack of news here.
[01:54:28.582 --> 01:54:31.824]  I want to get into Ashcroft and Janet Reno's testimonies and the rest of it.
[01:54:31.864 --> 01:54:47.615]  Before we go to these calls and into all this news, Paul, your book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsor Terror in the New World Order, it just got reviewed by the big Alexandria newspaper, and it got a rave review, and I'm proud to see that.
[01:54:47.755 --> 01:54:50.477]  I mean, most big publishers try to get their books reviewed.
[01:54:51.484 --> 01:54:56.929]  And I think we've now had four newspapers review my book and your book all favorably, and this is one of the latest.
[01:54:58.451 --> 01:55:00.793]  If people get Warner out of chaos, what will they be getting?
[01:55:01.812 --> 01:55:20.996]  They'll be getting, probably many people have said, the most well-documented book on these subjects ever written, basically, because every page has, well, every chapter has 30 sources saying directly, you know, what I'm saying and where I got it from and what evidence there is to back it up so people can go and check for themselves.
[01:55:21.516 --> 01:55:28.657]  And there are three chapters on 9-11 which cover not just the prior knowledge issue but the attack itself and how it was carried out.
[01:55:29.475 --> 01:55:46.649]  And then other chapters on Iraq as the war was starting, all the propaganda going on before it, and Israeli control of Hamas, British intelligence control of IRA terrorism, the whole government terror paradigm is detailed and documented, and it's a 320-page book.
[01:55:48.788 --> 01:55:53.734]  Yeah, it's $19.95, but to give one as a gift, the second one, when you buy one, is only $11.95.
[01:55:54.015 --> 01:55:56.998]  And there's my book, 9-11 Descent to Tyranny, that's excellent as well.
[01:55:57.019 --> 01:56:00.523]  It covers a lot of the same information in Paul's book and some things he doesn't cover.
[01:56:00.543 --> 01:56:01.244]  It's 220 pages long.
[01:56:01.264 --> 01:56:01.384]  It's $12.95.
[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:07.840]  I can't seem to get this right.
[01:56:07.940 --> 01:56:08.080]  It's $11.95.
[01:56:09.461 --> 01:56:09.961]  Excuse me.
[01:56:10.781 --> 01:56:12.162]  So, definitely want to get my book.
[01:56:12.422 --> 01:56:13.783]  I've also made 10 films.
[01:56:14.443 --> 01:56:16.644]  Order Out of Chaos is, of course, a book.
[01:56:17.084 --> 01:56:18.444]  My book is Descent into Tyranny.
[01:56:19.405 --> 01:56:23.886]  But the films are 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, and The Masters of Terror.
[01:56:23.946 --> 01:56:25.387]  They're both over two hours long.
[01:56:25.467 --> 01:56:29.609]  Cover September 11th and other government-sponsored terror events that are documented.
[01:56:30.249 --> 01:56:32.410]  There's Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:56:32.430 --> 01:56:34.010]  A lot of other great films we've made.
[01:56:34.290 --> 01:56:34.650]  They're $25.95 apiece.
[01:56:36.811 --> 01:56:41.233]  20 bucks when you order three or more of any of the ten films, and you've heard the rave reviews from listeners.
[01:56:41.593 --> 01:56:42.694]  So call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:56:42.714 --> 01:56:49.857]  That's 888-253-3139, or prisonplanet.com or infowars.com, or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:57:06.562 --> 01:57:07.122]  Don't wait.
[01:57:07.242 --> 01:57:08.362]  Get order out of chaos.
[01:57:08.422 --> 01:57:09.403]  Get the Sid DeTerny.
[01:57:09.703 --> 01:57:10.683]  Get the videos.
[01:57:10.783 --> 01:57:16.344]  Take action.
[01:57:16.364 --> 01:57:16.724]  888-253-3139.
[01:57:17.244 --> 01:57:20.165]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Illinois.
[01:57:20.205 --> 01:57:20.985]  Chris, you're on the air.
[01:57:21.045 --> 01:57:21.465]  Go ahead.
[01:57:21.565 --> 01:57:24.486]  Hi, I'll talk real fast because I have about five points to make.
[01:57:24.506 --> 01:57:25.986]  You know, this isn't Chris.
[01:57:26.026 --> 01:57:27.706]  This is Sandra, right?
[01:57:28.006 --> 01:57:28.807]  No, this is Chris.
[01:57:29.027 --> 01:57:29.507]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:57:29.547 --> 01:57:31.127]  From Illinois, yeah.
[01:57:31.187 --> 01:57:34.468]  You know, first of all, we've got to pray and repent for our country as Daniel did.
[01:57:34.508 --> 01:57:35.588]  That's first and foremost.
[01:57:36.192 --> 01:57:42.674]  But next, I want to tell you that, you know, we've been setting out your tapes, and we got it down to a system of, it's like less than $3.
[01:57:42.754 --> 01:57:45.455]  The key is put media mail on the envelope.
[01:57:46.075 --> 01:57:51.076]  For your, you know, for the tape, for the postage, everything is less than $3.
[01:57:51.316 --> 01:57:51.657]  Good.
[01:57:52.017 --> 01:57:54.337]  Who are you mailing the videos out to that you make copies of?
[01:57:54.377 --> 01:57:56.178]  We're out to, you know, a lot of our friends.
[01:57:57.180 --> 01:57:58.381]  Business associates.
[01:57:59.181 --> 01:58:02.202]  My daughter's an attorney, so she's got business associates and so on.
[01:58:02.723 --> 01:58:03.683]  And that's what we're doing.
[01:58:04.323 --> 01:58:08.025]  And also, my son's a cop, not in Illinois, but in another state.
[01:58:08.485 --> 01:58:18.230]  And I just want to tell you, you know, we also go to the police academy, you know, Citizens Police Academy, to get familiar with our police and so on.
[01:58:18.675 --> 01:58:19.215]  And talk to them.
[01:58:19.235 --> 01:58:23.338]  Now, most of the suburban cops have not been totally indoctrinated yet, okay?
[01:58:23.738 --> 01:58:24.578]  I'll tell you what.
[01:58:24.638 --> 01:58:25.059]  Stay there.
[01:58:25.119 --> 01:58:25.519]  Stay there.
[01:58:25.919 --> 01:58:26.719]  Don't hang up, Chris.
[01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:27.820]  I want to hear more about this.
[01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:34.464]  We'll get to you in about 70 seconds after we go to break, and then we'll get to Rhonda and Charles and others.
[01:58:34.944 --> 01:58:35.985]  Paul Watson's our guest.
[01:58:36.025 --> 01:58:36.785]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:58:36.825 --> 01:58:37.325]  Stay with us.
[01:58:37.706 --> 01:58:40.167]  The third jam-packed hour is coming up.
[01:58:42.307 --> 01:58:43.928]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:44.288 --> 01:58:50.011]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:58:50.271 --> 01:58:55.394]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:58:55.754 --> 01:59:05.019]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:59:05.379 --> 01:59:10.341]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:59:10.662 --> 01:59:14.664]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:59:14.864 --> 01:59:19.626]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:59:20.006 --> 01:59:25.889]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:59:26.249 --> 01:59:35.297]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:59:35.477 --> 01:59:39.000]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[01:59:39.561 --> 01:59:40.682]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:59:46.907 --> 01:59:47.547]  Big Brother.
[01:59:48.208 --> 01:59:49.309]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:49.969 --> 01:59:51.110]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:51.130 --> 01:59:52.532]  You want answers?
[01:59:53.294 --> 01:59:54.154]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:54.174 --> 01:59:58.476]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:59.036 --> 02:00:03.138]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:03.318 --> 02:00:06.379]  All right, my friends.
[02:00:07.019 --> 02:00:09.840]  Now into hour number three.
[02:00:11.101 --> 02:00:13.322]  Later in the hour, we will re-air those clips.
[02:00:13.382 --> 02:00:16.003]  There are some clips we haven't aired from the Lone Gunman episode.
[02:00:16.596 --> 02:00:26.644]  Where the secret government group wants to fly a hijacked jumbo jet by remote control of the World Trade Centers as a pretext for control, weapon sales, invasions of foreign countries.
[02:00:28.046 --> 02:00:30.267]  We'll get into the new reports of U.S.
[02:00:30.327 --> 02:00:32.609]  planting weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
[02:00:33.130 --> 02:00:34.251]  What's happening in Iraq.
[02:00:34.291 --> 02:00:35.952]  We'll get into some of the Big Brother news.
[02:00:36.372 --> 02:00:40.596]  Paul Watson, the webmaster of PrisonPlanet.com, my website, is joining us.
[02:00:41.677 --> 02:00:42.918]  We always appreciate having him on.
[02:00:43.298 --> 02:00:45.199]  Chris in Illinois, we were talking to her.
[02:00:45.279 --> 02:00:46.600]  Her son's a police officer.
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:52.563]  She's educating a lot of people, and she was saying that a lot of suburban police aren't completely indoctrinated yet.
[02:00:52.943 --> 02:00:58.145]  The question is, Chris, are they aware of the attempts to indoctrinate them?
[02:00:58.266 --> 02:00:59.006]  I don't think they are.
[02:00:59.426 --> 02:01:02.688]  But, you know, like I said, we went to the Citizens Academy.
[02:01:02.728 --> 02:01:03.588]  We talked to the police.
[02:01:03.908 --> 02:01:05.069]  We sent your films.
[02:01:05.109 --> 02:01:05.629]  We've given them.
[02:01:05.989 --> 02:01:06.950]  And we haven't been arrested yet.
[02:01:08.310 --> 02:01:10.271]  But so many of them are.
[02:01:10.331 --> 02:01:11.912]  Now, here's the point I want to make.
[02:01:12.232 --> 02:01:14.673]  My son, at one time, used to help.
[02:01:17.554 --> 02:01:19.135]  You know, learn how to shoot and so on.
[02:01:19.615 --> 02:01:25.640]  But now, I've talked to him, you know, like a couple years ago, they are trying to indoctrinate the local police.
[02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:31.124]  Because now, all of a sudden, he says, well, I don't think it's good for just everybody to have a gun.
[02:01:31.264 --> 02:01:31.945]  You know what I mean?
[02:01:32.165 --> 02:01:36.108]  They're doing it very, very slowly, but they're doing it.
[02:01:37.336 --> 02:01:41.337]  Yeah, so you need to ask your son, why is Chicago, New York, D.C.
[02:01:41.377 --> 02:01:43.997]  with gun bans the highest crime rate?
[02:01:44.037 --> 02:01:47.878]  Well, I know what to tell my son, but this is at a point.
[02:01:48.218 --> 02:01:49.378]  So is he listening to you?
[02:01:49.919 --> 02:01:51.919]  Well, I don't know.
[02:01:52.459 --> 02:01:54.039]  I have no idea what goes on in his mind.
[02:01:54.139 --> 02:01:57.060]  So suddenly all of us shouldn't have guns, huh?
[02:01:57.080 --> 02:01:57.920]  Well, yeah.
[02:01:58.060 --> 02:01:59.881]  I mean, you know, they're doing it slowly.
[02:02:00.081 --> 02:02:02.021]  Not everybody should have a gun because they're nothing.
[02:02:02.321 --> 02:02:03.661]  You know, that type of thing.
[02:02:04.141 --> 02:02:07.042]  Another thing, when I write to the editors, I write letters all the time
[02:02:07.483 --> 02:02:10.645]  I include your website at the end of the letter.
[02:02:10.725 --> 02:02:11.326]  Well, thank you.
[02:02:11.346 --> 02:02:12.727]  That's getting us a lot of visitors.
[02:02:12.807 --> 02:02:20.512]  I mean, I get sent a lot of clippings where people's letters to the editor say, everything I state here is backed up at Infowars.com.
[02:02:20.572 --> 02:02:20.772]  Right.
[02:02:21.232 --> 02:02:26.916]  Another thing, too, Kelly, you know, he's such a nice guy, but I want to scream because...
[02:02:27.617 --> 02:02:30.858]  If he doesn't want the money, give it to somebody that can use it.
[02:02:30.898 --> 02:02:31.458]  You know what I mean?
[02:02:31.758 --> 02:02:32.639]  To help our cause.
[02:02:32.659 --> 02:02:37.240]  For those that just joined us, Kelly Rushing arrested for handing one of my videos to a state police officer.
[02:02:37.860 --> 02:02:40.821]  And he was found not guilty by the jury of terrific threats.
[02:02:40.941 --> 02:02:45.183]  But the officer thinks it's illegal to educate police in a kindly fashion.
[02:02:46.071 --> 02:02:49.353]  And this just shows how bad our society is.
[02:02:49.413 --> 02:02:56.616]  The judge, the prosecutor, and the state police want to arrest us for this, at least in areas of Kentucky.
[02:02:56.896 --> 02:02:58.097]  Paul Watson, any comments?
[02:02:58.777 --> 02:03:00.198]  Yeah, well, it shows the climate.
[02:03:00.518 --> 02:03:03.940]  The First Amendment under attack is to give out a videotape.
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.220]  It's called terroristic.
[02:03:05.681 --> 02:03:08.282]  There was an article we posted nearly a week ago where
[02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:09.180]  I think so.
[02:03:26.731 --> 02:03:38.041]  So, the First Amendment on all fronts is under massive attack at the moment, and I'm glad to see that this jury had some common sense, but as you said, the case should have been dismissed way before that.
[02:03:38.101 --> 02:03:40.603]  Now, you had a BBC reporter two years ago.
[02:03:40.643 --> 02:03:43.365]  We interviewed him, and that interview's posted in the audio section.
[02:03:43.805 --> 02:03:46.327]  He was arrested for saying the word homosexual.
[02:03:46.367 --> 02:03:47.528]  That's not allowed in England.
[02:03:47.789 --> 02:03:50.211]  That's considered a hateful word, and you have...
[02:03:50.831 --> 02:03:57.456]  Yeah, that was Robin Page who gave a speech saying that farmers should have the same rights as homosexuals and Muslims.
[02:04:07.277 --> 02:04:09.419]  Scotland Yard were called immediately after him.
[02:04:09.459 --> 02:04:11.701]  Within an hour, you know, he was taken and arrested.
[02:04:12.161 --> 02:04:14.664]  And obviously we've got the interview posted in Deep Archive.
[02:04:14.704 --> 02:04:18.787]  So, again, hate speech is designed to attack free speech.
[02:04:18.847 --> 02:04:21.309]  That's why the whole movement of hate speech was started.
[02:04:21.649 --> 02:04:27.734]  To the point now where the Washington Post is saying that anyone who uses the term neocon really means Jew.
[02:04:28.155 --> 02:04:31.017]  So even that term is out of bounds now, according to them.
[02:04:31.277 --> 02:04:34.220]  When they call themselves neocons, when Bush does,
[02:04:34.833 --> 02:04:36.433]  And I heard Limbaugh do that about a year ago.
[02:04:36.473 --> 02:04:38.354]  It's secret racist code word.
[02:04:38.534 --> 02:04:39.374]  Thanks for the call, Chris.
[02:04:39.394 --> 02:04:39.894]  We'll be back.

[02:05:42.346 --> 02:05:46.667]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:05:46.867 --> 02:05:51.209]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:05:53.191 --> 02:05:55.813]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:05:55.853 --> 02:05:58.654]  The New World Order can emerge.
[02:05:58.975 --> 02:06:03.177]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:06:03.257 --> 02:06:10.182]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:06:10.322 --> 02:06:12.323]  You will lose your liberty.

[02:07:38.910 --> 02:07:40.231]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:07:43.494 --> 02:07:49.519]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:07:50.119 --> 02:07:53.102]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:54.711 --> 02:07:57.472]  All right, now eight minutes into hour three, my friends.
[02:07:59.333 --> 02:08:06.956]  Before we get back into the news and all your calls, and we're going to go to your calls here in a second, I've had this story for about a week.
[02:08:07.096 --> 02:08:07.857]  I never covered it.
[02:08:07.937 --> 02:08:08.737]  Wired news.
[02:08:09.597 --> 02:08:22.163]  Thanks to an unusual loophole and the strict rules of medical ethics, they're not strict, hundreds of trauma patients in California, Texas, and a few other states will be taking a gamble when ambulances come to scoop them up after accidents or acts of violence.
[02:08:22.879 --> 02:08:23.079]  I think so.
[02:08:47.040 --> 02:09:00.387]  Emergency research in general creates a special set of circumstances, said Kelly Fryer Edwards, the University of Wisconsin Medical Ethics, whose colleagues across the country are divided over the wisdom of blood study.
[02:09:01.087 --> 02:09:02.988]  Well, I don't care if you're divided.
[02:09:03.008 --> 02:09:15.354]  They've caught them from coast to coast when you die, even though you're not an organ donor, stealing your corneas, stealing skin, cutting you open, stealing goodies, stealing organs.
[02:09:16.896 --> 02:09:19.097]  And this is just setting a precedent.
[02:09:19.237 --> 02:09:23.358]  I've seen a bunch of these articles where they're doing stuff like this where they don't ask.
[02:09:24.178 --> 02:09:26.238]  They just put experimental things in you.
[02:09:26.258 --> 02:09:28.679]  It's the same thing with the troops, a captive audience.
[02:09:28.699 --> 02:09:33.280]  I mean, they'll line them up and give them 30 shots at once, all this experimental stuff, not even tell them what it is.
[02:09:34.181 --> 02:09:35.841]  Paul, this isn't freedom, is it?
[02:09:36.929 --> 02:09:49.657]  Well, no, obviously that's preparing medical personnel, preparing them to give forced injections and forced vaccinations under a bio-attack situation, which is outlined in the model state's Emergency Health Powers Act.
[02:09:49.677 --> 02:09:53.660]  So, I mean, that's probably part of that movement as to why they're introducing it.
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:57.761]  By the way, they've been having more of these red alert, they call them red alert lockdowns.
[02:09:58.102 --> 02:10:02.163]  Police come in, aim machine guns at children, police dogs jump on them.
[02:10:02.463 --> 02:10:05.104]  Turns out it's really to get them ready for terror roundups.
[02:10:05.344 --> 02:10:10.886]  Well, we had that a year ago, Washington Post, Gannett News Service, both, where we're going to be enemies if we leave our homes.
[02:10:11.226 --> 02:10:15.008]  Our children will be taken from us to FEMA camps until we turn our guns in.
[02:10:15.048 --> 02:10:15.448]  Comments?
[02:10:16.266 --> 02:10:24.409]  Well, yeah, and in your Police State, 2000 Police State 2 films, they had all these kind of drills, and this was before 9-11 that these films were made, obviously.
[02:10:24.889 --> 02:10:30.731]  And the official line was it's for preparation for terrorism and, you know, urban warfare.
[02:10:30.991 --> 02:10:32.811]  We had military walking through the streets.
[02:10:33.451 --> 02:10:44.475]  And, you know, these drills going on in schools where officers run around with guns, and we're talking about military-style police in some of them, where guns have gone off and, you know, shot kids in the head.
[02:10:45.046 --> 02:10:48.808]  That happened in Michigan, and also they killed top of the year in Fort Worth.
[02:10:49.609 --> 02:11:08.480]  Now, a few months ago, the BBC reported that troops from the former Eastern Bloc were there running around terrorizing people in the countryside, doing arrests as part of a drill, and we've had the same stuff going on here, and it turned out that was part of an acclimation process as well.
[02:11:09.545 --> 02:11:15.688]  Yeah, and also Tony Blair had tanks rolling around Heathrow right before the Iraq War to bully everyone into supporting it.
[02:11:16.348 --> 02:11:25.112]  And the top police chief of Metropolitan Police, John Stevens, recently called for, well, he said he would have no hesitation in putting troops on British streets.
[02:11:25.192 --> 02:11:30.555]  And they've had that, you know, building up the pretext for that for 20, 30 years with the IRA bombings.
[02:11:30.635 --> 02:11:33.516]  So, yeah, same policies on both sides of the pond.
[02:11:34.117 --> 02:11:35.898]  Yeah, whatever's happening there is happening here.
[02:11:35.918 --> 02:11:37.558]  Whatever's happening here is happening there.
[02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:46.865]  I call it the Echelon Group of Countries because five countries all work in echelon, the spy grid, and they all follow the same policies.
[02:11:47.768 --> 02:11:54.491]  Well, yeah, it's like a spider web across the whole globe where you have different points of control, but it's the same web.
[02:11:54.771 --> 02:11:57.432]  I call it the Anglo-Saxon Mafia.
[02:11:57.532 --> 02:12:17.061]  It's just these five, six countries that are heading it all, and the so-called non-integrating states like Iraq or Haiti, for example, get bombed into submission if they don't go along with the policy, even though they're these small, broken-back third-world countries, they still need to be brought in line with the agenda.
[02:12:17.873 --> 02:12:21.495]  Before we go to Rhonda and Charles and Tim and others, I wanted to bring this up.
[02:12:22.636 --> 02:12:29.420]  You mentioned that the Washington Post, and I didn't see the article, said that neocon is a code word for Jews.
[02:12:29.861 --> 02:12:32.482]  Were they implying that you're racist, if you use the term?
[02:12:33.563 --> 02:12:41.248]  Yeah, it was in response to a Pentagon whistleblower called Lieutenant Colonel Karen Kwiatkowski.
[02:12:41.909 --> 02:12:42.630]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[02:13:11.361 --> 02:13:16.803]  Because I heard Limbaugh over a year ago say, Neocon is code word for anti-Semitism.
[02:13:17.263 --> 02:13:18.783]  Only anti-Semites use this.
[02:13:19.503 --> 02:13:20.484]  Now, let's go back.
[02:13:22.724 --> 02:13:31.427]  Yesterday, Monday, we played a clip off PBS with Crystal's father calling himself a Neocon.
[02:13:32.242 --> 02:13:35.043]  They put out books calling themselves the neocons.
[02:13:35.444 --> 02:13:37.745]  They are the neoconservative movement.
[02:13:38.365 --> 02:13:40.286]  And this is the tactic over and over again.
[02:13:40.326 --> 02:13:41.907]  You're exposing their corruption.
[02:13:42.487 --> 02:13:43.487]  And some of them are Jews.
[02:13:43.507 --> 02:13:44.108]  Some of them aren't.
[02:13:44.628 --> 02:13:46.429]  And then they try to lay the label.
[02:13:46.469 --> 02:13:47.209]  I mean, it's anything.
[02:13:47.589 --> 02:13:49.450]  I don't want you to put poisonous vaccines in me.
[02:13:49.530 --> 02:13:50.771]  That's code for anti-Semitism.
[02:13:51.431 --> 02:13:52.352]  I'm against corruption.
[02:13:52.592 --> 02:13:53.732]  I'm against the corrupt banks.
[02:13:53.812 --> 02:13:55.073]  That's code for anti-Semitism.
[02:13:55.633 --> 02:13:58.935]  And they're actually creating anti-Semitism because people then go, what do you mean Jews?
[02:13:59.195 --> 02:14:00.856]  And that gets people thinking about that.
[02:14:01.176 --> 02:14:10.660]  I mean, it's amazing, but Kelly Rushing, you heard him last hour, no criminal record, hands out one of my videos and a Ron Paul video, gets arrested.
[02:14:11.481 --> 02:14:23.366]  He had two separate news teams, one News 12 from Missouri, show up with the video cameras, big news cameras, and they asked him, they said, have you ever been a member of the Klan?
[02:14:23.406 --> 02:14:24.467]  He said, well, of course not.
[02:14:25.149 --> 02:14:27.071]  And, well, the authorities are telling us this.
[02:14:27.151 --> 02:14:34.856]  So, see, this is what they do time and time again is they try to put these labels in there.
[02:14:34.916 --> 02:14:38.679]  And, look, it's not going to work because they misuse them so much and misapply them.
[02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:41.982]  The liberals are all calling them neocons.
[02:14:42.222 --> 02:14:45.324]  The neocons coined the term neocon.
[02:14:45.624 --> 02:14:47.086]  It's in the PNAC documents.
[02:14:48.026 --> 02:14:48.967]  So this is incredible.
[02:14:49.833 --> 02:15:02.062]  Well, it's also the elimination of language, terms of reference that we use to, you know, illustrate our arguments because they can't attack the arguments themselves because they're backed up by proof.
[02:15:02.082 --> 02:15:06.285]  They're just trying to eliminate the terms that we're using and try and label us as, you know, racist.
[02:15:06.325 --> 02:15:08.827]  So it's that Orwellian thing of eliminating language.
[02:15:08.847 --> 02:15:12.350]  I remember three years ago, Texas legislature was in session.
[02:15:12.370 --> 02:15:12.390]  I...
[02:15:13.965 --> 02:15:18.488]  Jews for the Preservation of Firearms member runs in right before I testify and says, Alex, get out here!
[02:15:18.548 --> 02:15:19.048]  Bribery!
[02:15:19.108 --> 02:15:20.709]  I had a video camera.
[02:15:21.370 --> 02:15:23.051]  It's funny that it was a Jew telling me this.
[02:15:23.231 --> 02:15:25.452]  They can't say it was some type of racism.
[02:15:25.952 --> 02:15:28.854]  And I run out, and there's the two black guys who testified.
[02:15:28.914 --> 02:15:31.615]  Basically, we're black, we're evil, we'll kill you.
[02:15:33.417 --> 02:15:35.778]  Blacks will kill you with guns if you don't give your guns up.
[02:15:36.238 --> 02:15:36.979]  They were there.
[02:15:37.519 --> 02:15:41.262]  The handgun control group was using them to play a race card.
[02:15:41.602 --> 02:15:43.183]  They were indeed being the racists.
[02:15:43.583 --> 02:15:52.249]  The paid black poster boys who weren't even gang members who talked in a normal accent when they weren't up on the stand or up there testifying.
[02:15:52.289 --> 02:15:55.892]  And I caught them being paid in cash hundreds of dollars apiece.
[02:15:56.627 --> 02:15:58.688]  Well, it's like how they use people like Rice and
[02:16:21.158 --> 02:16:27.622]  You know, Powell was the front man in front of the UN with weapons of mass disruption evidence, which he now admitted that was completely false.
[02:16:27.662 --> 02:16:31.584]  But they used black individuals to elevate them into high positions of power.
[02:16:31.904 --> 02:16:42.931]  And then when you call them liars, because they're lying, because it comes out late, and they even admit it sometimes like Powell did, people say, oh, you can't criticize that individual because he or she is black.
[02:16:43.731 --> 02:16:46.733]  Well, people are just ignoring this now.
[02:16:46.893 --> 02:16:48.414]  I remember... Last point, we'll go to the calls.
[02:16:49.494 --> 02:16:50.155]  I remember...
[02:16:51.653 --> 02:17:07.479]  Back in the late 90s with all the Chinese espionage news, and all these thousands of communist spies, Clinton selling us out, having Ron Brown taken out, and then all these newscasts going, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-tonight, the focus on Chinese espionage.
[02:17:07.579 --> 02:17:08.919]  Is it really racism?
[02:17:09.340 --> 02:17:12.761]  I mean, it has nothing to do with racism, but they just do that.
[02:17:14.286 --> 02:17:22.878]  Well, it's just the big hate speech movement which says that anyone who talks about a new world order is secretly, you know, talking about a Jewish racist conspiracy.
[02:17:23.439 --> 02:17:32.331]  All that comes out of the ADL, who then go and sponsor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is, you know, admitted his father was a stormtrooper, says in his book he admires Hitler.
[02:17:33.892 --> 02:17:39.974]  It's coming from the very people who are supposed to protect Jews and Jewish interests, but in fact are attacking them.
[02:17:40.114 --> 02:17:46.316]  Well, we've also caught Jewish groups with people dressed up in Nazi outfits acting like there's some Nazi threat.
[02:17:46.516 --> 02:17:48.656]  Let's go ahead and... This is disgusting.
[02:17:49.376 --> 02:17:49.977]  I'm sick of it.
[02:17:50.217 --> 02:17:54.378]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rhonda in Missouri, and then we'll go to Charles and Tim and others.
[02:17:54.598 --> 02:17:55.298]  Rhonda, go ahead.
[02:17:55.318 --> 02:17:56.178]  Hi, Alex.
[02:17:56.518 --> 02:17:56.838]  Hello.
[02:17:56.938 --> 02:17:58.919]  That's like Freedom Fighter being a terrorist.
[02:18:00.550 --> 02:18:03.332]  That big association with the freedom fighters in Iraq.
[02:18:03.952 --> 02:18:06.474]  They're really terrorists because they're killing our soldiers.
[02:18:06.514 --> 02:18:06.834]  Yes.
[02:18:07.334 --> 02:18:09.295]  That'll be when it comes here, freedom fighters.
[02:18:09.335 --> 02:18:10.576]  Well, of course, they're terrorists.
[02:18:11.316 --> 02:18:19.461]  Well, I have to say I don't agree with some of the groups over there, but we are in a war, and then to call them terrorists, no, they're obviously enemy soldiers.
[02:18:19.701 --> 02:18:20.461]  It's the labeling.
[02:18:20.961 --> 02:18:22.582]  It's the psychological warfare.
[02:18:22.602 --> 02:18:27.585]  I actually called in Mr. Rushing talking about I can appreciate terrorism,
[02:18:28.064 --> 02:18:28.504]  I think so.
[02:18:49.847 --> 02:18:55.832]  But I would probably, if it was me, I would probably go after the troop in which the patrolman came out of.
[02:18:56.132 --> 02:19:02.457]  That way I could have them take that money and put into that troop and educate their officers in the Constitution.
[02:19:02.837 --> 02:19:06.861]  And then I'd go after the state level to have them put that money.
[02:19:06.941 --> 02:19:13.686]  With $500,000 you could educate every Kentucky trooper on the Constitution?
[02:19:13.946 --> 02:19:14.707]  That would be balanced.
[02:19:15.444 --> 02:19:17.965]  Well, for those that don't know, they arrested him for giving out videos.
[02:19:18.345 --> 02:19:19.406]  He was found not guilty.
[02:19:19.446 --> 02:19:26.169]  The point is, they prosecuted, they took him to trial, they tried to put him in jail, and now he's saying, oh, I'm going to be nice, I don't know if I'll sue him.
[02:19:26.429 --> 02:19:27.369]  He needs to sue him.
[02:19:28.409 --> 02:19:28.950]  Anything else?
[02:19:28.970 --> 02:19:33.111]  Look at how much money they steal from our communities to send out there to kidnap children.
[02:19:34.712 --> 02:19:36.093]  Boy, I tell you, that's another big issue.
[02:19:36.133 --> 02:19:37.153]  Anything else you want to add?
[02:19:37.873 --> 02:19:39.634]  No, God bless you, God bless everybody.
[02:19:40.555 --> 02:19:40.875]  Thank you.
[02:19:43.499 --> 02:19:43.939]  We're good to go.
[02:20:07.159 --> 02:20:07.859]  We're good to go.
[02:20:36.256 --> 02:20:47.001]  I'm a nurse and I injured my back and I've lost 22 pounds and 9 inches.
[02:20:47.262 --> 02:20:49.403]  I would definitely recommend Vim and Vigor.
[02:20:49.923 --> 02:20:54.505]  As far as losing weight, Vim and Vigor is the best investment I ever made.
[02:20:54.845 --> 02:20:56.166]  It actually works.
[02:20:56.605 --> 02:21:00.027]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[02:21:00.047 --> 02:21:01.528]  I've tried many, many products.
[02:21:01.748 --> 02:21:03.970]  I have never experienced anything like collagenate.
[02:21:04.370 --> 02:21:07.992]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than eight weeks.
[02:21:08.412 --> 02:21:09.053]  It truly works.
[02:21:09.393 --> 02:21:10.774]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[02:21:11.014 --> 02:21:16.738]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:21:16.798 --> 02:21:22.621]  Vim and Vigor's collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism, and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[02:21:22.761 --> 02:21:25.343]  Vim and Vigor's collagenate really does work.
[02:21:25.683 --> 02:21:26.744]  And it's healthy for you, too.
[02:21:26.924 --> 02:21:27.944]  Call Vim and Vigor today.
[02:21:27.964 --> 02:21:28.204]  1-800-622-THIN.
[02:21:28.265 --> 02:21:28.465]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[02:21:28.485 --> 02:21:29.805]  Get $25 off a three-month supply of collagenate.
[02:21:29.825 --> 02:21:30.326]  So call now.
[02:21:30.346 --> 02:21:30.486]  1-800-622-THIN.
[02:21:30.506 --> 02:21:30.706]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[02:21:43.129 --> 02:21:45.331]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[02:21:45.771 --> 02:21:50.135]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[02:21:50.415 --> 02:21:56.220]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[02:21:56.440 --> 02:22:00.503]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[02:22:00.784 --> 02:22:06.428]  However, they have become the elite group more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[02:22:06.548 --> 02:22:09.170]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[02:22:11.252 --> 02:22:15.154]  By mid-1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[02:22:15.194 --> 02:22:17.555]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[02:22:17.915 --> 02:22:20.216]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[02:22:20.597 --> 02:22:24.218]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[02:22:24.699 --> 02:22:30.902]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[02:22:31.342 --> 02:22:32.322]  You'll be glad you did.
[02:22:32.662 --> 02:22:33.103]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:33.143 --> 02:22:33.383]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:42.159 --> 02:22:43.159]  It's finally here.
[02:22:43.299 --> 02:22:44.260]  Spring has arrived.
[02:22:44.460 --> 02:22:47.421]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:22:47.641 --> 02:22:51.102]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:22:51.302 --> 02:22:59.465]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can too with the help of the ARC Institute's brand new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[02:22:59.725 --> 02:23:03.466]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[02:23:03.666 --> 02:23:08.688]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[02:23:08.968 --> 02:23:13.473]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[02:23:13.673 --> 02:23:17.737]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[02:23:17.817 --> 02:23:24.965]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[02:23:25.245 --> 02:23:30.714]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[02:23:30.914 --> 02:23:32.817]  Call the Ark Institute toll free at 800-255-1912.
[02:23:32.837 --> 02:23:34.339]  That's 1-800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com today.
[02:23:48.525 --> 02:23:51.527]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[02:23:52.127 --> 02:23:54.709]  A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[02:23:54.769 --> 02:23:57.211]  All right, let's go quickly to your calls.
[02:23:58.451 --> 02:24:00.433]  Let's go ahead and go to Charles in Rhode Island.
[02:24:00.453 --> 02:24:01.413]  Charles, thanks for holding.
[02:24:01.433 --> 02:24:01.874]  Go ahead.
[02:24:02.334 --> 02:24:05.216]  Yeah, thank you, Alex, for giving us the education you do every day.
[02:24:05.236 --> 02:24:07.397]  I want to know you're deeply appreciated.
[02:24:08.298 --> 02:24:10.119]  First of all, I thought about Mr. Ruskin also.
[02:24:11.584 --> 02:24:16.167]  When you go along to get along, you end up in a communist, socialist, fascist form of government every time.
[02:24:16.187 --> 02:24:17.248]  You know?
[02:24:17.928 --> 02:24:33.899]  That's what you're going to do by kowtowing to the police matter, is do the Title 42, Section 1983 or 1985, whichever one he prefers, you know, whether it's a single person or two or more people, is 1985, and attack the police that way.
[02:24:34.820 --> 02:24:41.464]  Also, I wanted to tell you that I called Friday afternoon in the 3 o'clock hour to the Kentucky State Police,
[02:24:41.880 --> 02:24:45.161]  And by the way, that wasn't true, what they said.
[02:24:45.961 --> 02:24:55.744]  It's been in the news, he was arrested for giving somebody a videotape, they thought the content of it was threatening, they tried to put him in jail for it, and the jury found him not guilty.
[02:25:11.420 --> 02:25:19.263]  Okay, but here's where I made the fatal mistake, is I tried to educate this person, and I asked this guy if he ever read Animal Farm by George Orwell, yet 1984.
[02:25:19.763 --> 02:25:22.504]  You know, why don't you go read and copy Animal Farm?
[02:25:22.785 --> 02:25:24.965]  And this guy was, like, belligerent beyond belief.
[02:25:24.985 --> 02:25:29.987]  You know, but every time that I have a copy of Animal Farm, he changes attitude real fast.
[02:25:30.548 --> 02:25:33.809]  And I'll thank you for all your good deeds, and close here, sir.
[02:25:33.889 --> 02:25:34.189]  Thank you.
[02:25:34.269 --> 02:25:35.450]  Well, I appreciate you for calling.
[02:25:35.490 --> 02:25:36.450]  God bless, Paul.
[02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:52.692]  Well, yeah, I mean, the reaction of Kelly rushing, obviously we're saying he's a nice guy and everything, but as everybody knows, 99% of, you know, how people react to you is how you boil it down to you walking down the street, how you carry yourself, you know, how you look.
[02:25:52.832 --> 02:25:54.392]  People will react to you in that way.
[02:25:54.412 --> 02:26:02.074]  So if you act like a coward, then the people out there, especially those in positions of power, will seek to dominate you and will treat you like a coward.
[02:26:02.534 --> 02:26:04.895]  Well, Kelly had a lot of courage.
[02:26:04.915 --> 02:26:06.715]  He's just such a nice guy.
[02:26:06.795 --> 02:26:07.155]  He's like
[02:26:07.841 --> 02:26:27.136]  You know, Samson or something, taking all of this, I mean, he goes out, he gives out the videos, gives one to the prosecutor, the prosecutor says, oh, I love this, it's good, gives it to other officials, gives it to the cop, he arrests him, and then Kelly doesn't plea bargain as they threaten him, goes to trial, defeats them, and then walks over and tells the cop he's sorry all this happened when the cop did it.
[02:26:27.256 --> 02:26:29.558]  That just shows what a nice guy he is.
[02:26:30.566 --> 02:26:40.470]  Yeah, I mean, it shows that the reaction has to be stronger, though, and as you said, he does need to go ahead and sue to prevent any kind of pretext that giving out videotapes is, you know, illegal.
[02:26:40.490 --> 02:26:47.473]  It's like Microsoft are trying to impose a charge on every email sent out to supposedly stop spammers.
[02:26:47.613 --> 02:26:53.096]  Well, we know it's to stop people emailing to mass news groups as they do the information that we present.
[02:26:53.536 --> 02:27:00.819]  So it's that, you know, it's trying to prevent communication, calling it terrorism or doing what, you know, people like Microsoft are doing, charging for it.
[02:27:00.879 --> 02:27:04.060]  So it's an attempt to shut down free speech on every level.
[02:27:04.380 --> 02:27:06.581]  By the way, where is that with Microsoft right now?
[02:27:07.321 --> 02:27:11.403]  All I know is that Bill Gates proposed it and at the moment they're looking into it.
[02:27:11.463 --> 02:27:16.005]  So they said it may come into effect towards the end of this decade.
[02:27:16.025 --> 02:27:17.945]  That's insane.
[02:27:19.716 --> 02:27:21.877]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:27:21.917 --> 02:27:23.337]  Let's talk to Tim in Ohio.
[02:27:23.377 --> 02:27:23.998]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:27:26.899 --> 02:27:27.599]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:27:27.939 --> 02:27:28.739]  Good afternoon, Tim.
[02:27:28.799 --> 02:27:29.320]  Hello, Paul.
[02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:29.920]  Hello.
[02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:37.803]  I'm glad you're here because over the weekend, earlier you were talking about how there's the television show, The Lone Gunman.
[02:27:38.683 --> 02:27:40.043]  Yeah, we're going to play those clips again.
[02:27:40.063 --> 02:27:40.344]  Go ahead.
[02:27:40.624 --> 02:27:44.505]  And the way that there's little hints in the television and the movies.
[02:27:44.565 --> 02:27:46.786]  I think, Alex, you called that the propaganda placements?
[02:27:47.884 --> 02:27:52.607]  Well, propaganda placement is when they pay to have the propaganda put in the TV shows.
[02:27:53.348 --> 02:27:59.132]  This, I would call it preconditioning, preparing the psychological ground.
[02:27:59.612 --> 02:28:04.655]  Over the weekend, I was going through an old box I found in the closet, and I came across a videotape.
[02:28:04.715 --> 02:28:05.436]  It wasn't labeled.
[02:28:05.476 --> 02:28:06.056]  I threw it in.
[02:28:06.457 --> 02:28:12.681]  And, Paul, you might remember in the late 80s in your country, a television show was produced called The Max Headroom.
[02:28:14.031 --> 02:28:16.112]  I recall the name, but I never watched it.
[02:28:16.232 --> 02:28:17.093]  Yeah, I've seen the show.
[02:28:17.333 --> 02:28:29.899]  This particular episode dealt with a corporation called SSI, who had, for lack of a better description, the Beast Computer, and they had everyone's name in it, and they went on to show people being scanned.
[02:28:30.880 --> 02:28:43.566]  Their records turned to poison when the people were trying to investigate the people behind the structure of the upper echelon of this security corporation, and when it came down to it, they almost killed them.
[02:28:46.235 --> 02:28:48.898]  Now, Max Hendren was the computerized talking head.
[02:28:49.158 --> 02:28:53.703]  Yeah, he was a spokesman for Coca-Cola as far as this country.
[02:28:53.763 --> 02:28:55.805]  I know there were several more episodes that aired.
[02:28:55.865 --> 02:29:02.833]  ABC picked it up for like six weeks in the springtime of 1986, and then it went by the wayside.
[02:29:02.873 --> 02:29:07.798]  But it's interesting how they show it to you there, and then when people see it,
[02:29:08.482 --> 02:29:10.103]  Or you try to say, well, that's going to happen in reality.
[02:29:10.144 --> 02:29:11.345]  Oh, no, that's just a TV show.
[02:29:11.365 --> 02:29:12.566]  There's nothing to worry about.
[02:29:12.586 --> 02:29:19.872]  Arnold Schwarzenegger was in a film where they changed the Constitution to whereby, you know, foreigners could become president, and he became president in the film.
[02:29:20.733 --> 02:29:22.955]  But in the film, he first became California governor.
[02:29:24.256 --> 02:29:25.137]  In a recall.
[02:29:25.157 --> 02:29:27.519]  All right, we'll be back.
[02:29:27.899 --> 02:29:28.440]  Thanks for the call.
[02:29:28.500 --> 02:29:29.561]  More news, more calls.
[02:29:32.443 --> 02:29:33.344]  We're on the march.
[02:29:33.824 --> 02:29:35.326]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:36.336 --> 02:29:39.031]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:42.279 --> 02:29:44.240]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[02:29:44.340 --> 02:29:45.000]  Hello, folks.
[02:29:45.120 --> 02:29:55.045]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:29:55.425 --> 02:29:59.947]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:30:00.007 --> 02:30:11.352]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:30:11.772 --> 02:30:12.413]  We're good to go.
[02:30:27.086 --> 02:30:33.394]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:30:33.474 --> 02:30:37.659]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:30:37.880 --> 02:30:38.701]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:30:42.285 --> 02:30:45.026]  Do you know there's a price war in the insurance business?
[02:30:45.106 --> 02:30:46.807]  Well, right now, don't wait.
[02:30:46.847 --> 02:30:52.389]  You call Term Busters, and you could save up to 40% on quality term life insurance.
[02:30:52.549 --> 02:30:53.430]  Call now.
[02:30:53.450 --> 02:30:53.510]  800-430-6748.
[02:30:53.530 --> 02:30:53.570]  800-430-6748.
[02:30:53.590 --> 02:30:54.530]  Here's one example.
[02:30:54.550 --> 02:30:57.932]  A male age 50, non-tobacco, issue preferred, half million dollars of coverage is only $113 a month.
[02:31:08.736 --> 02:31:10.797]  Guaranteed for 20 years.
[02:31:11.077 --> 02:31:17.799]  Call Term Busters to save up to 40% on term life insurance.
[02:31:17.819 --> 02:31:18.779]  800-430-6748.
[02:31:18.799 --> 02:31:20.660]  800-430-6748.
[02:31:21.160 --> 02:31:22.741]  We have smokers rates too.
[02:31:23.021 --> 02:31:27.302]  We specialize in half million dollar and up term life insurance coverage.
[02:31:27.562 --> 02:31:33.324]  Call my friends at Term Busters now to see if you can save up to 40% on term life insurance.
[02:31:33.404 --> 02:31:33.444]  800-430-6748
[02:31:43.470 --> 02:31:45.532]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[02:31:45.692 --> 02:31:47.353]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot.
[02:31:47.473 --> 02:31:55.460]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[02:31:55.700 --> 02:32:02.145]  Imagine hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini, followed by peaches, mixed fruit, or pineapple for dessert.
[02:32:02.325 --> 02:32:03.566]  Just a few of the many selections.
[02:32:04.927 --> 02:32:09.992]  The Long Life Food Depot was recently mentioned in a USA Today article on the very subject of emergency preparations.
[02:32:10.012 --> 02:32:12.275]  It makes sense to be prepared, and Long Life Food Depot makes it easy.
[02:32:19.802 --> 02:32:23.826]  Long-term storable MREs make for convenience when camping, hiking, or canoeing.
[02:32:24.046 --> 02:32:24.927]  No fires allowed.
[02:32:25.067 --> 02:32:26.068]  Hot meals still are.
[02:32:26.189 --> 02:32:30.253]  Call the Long Life Food Depot toll-free at 800-601-2833.
[02:32:30.293 --> 02:32:31.854]  That's 1-800-601-2833.
[02:32:32.775 --> 02:32:35.398]  Or visit longlifefood.com.
[02:32:35.658 --> 02:32:39.001]  The Long Life Food Depot offers free shipping via UPS ground on every order.
[02:32:39.102 --> 02:32:39.562]  Don't wait.
[02:32:39.662 --> 02:32:41.324]  Call the Long Life Food Depot today.
[02:32:52.415 --> 02:32:52.855]  All right.
[02:32:52.875 --> 02:32:59.618]  We're just going to take four or five more calls from Joe, Hal, Gabe, and just a few others.
[02:32:59.638 --> 02:33:02.460]  Then I want to hit a bunch of news that we haven't even detailed yet.
[02:33:04.161 --> 02:33:10.664]  But after we take these calls, I'm going to air a couple of these lone-gumming clips because earlier, Murphy's Law, the computer crashed during one of them.
[02:33:11.885 --> 02:33:15.146]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Texas.
[02:33:15.226 --> 02:33:16.147]  Joe, you're on the air.
[02:33:16.207 --> 02:33:16.527]  Welcome.
[02:33:17.253 --> 02:33:18.174]  Hey, how's it going today, Alex?
[02:33:18.494 --> 02:33:18.794]  Good.
[02:33:19.114 --> 02:33:24.458]  Hey, I was just wondering, I'm, you know, newly coming around to all this information.
[02:33:24.518 --> 02:33:27.440]  I've been a political couch potato all my life.
[02:33:27.901 --> 02:33:40.430]  And I was wondering if you've ever considered putting out, like, if I wanted to recodify Ozzie Comitantes in my area, if I wanted to put local actions limiting the Patriot Act.
[02:33:41.030 --> 02:33:42.751]  I just don't know where to start.
[02:33:42.891 --> 02:33:43.592]  Okay, well...
[02:33:44.698 --> 02:33:58.401]  I actually came out with the idea to have towns and cities and states throw it out, put out the basic idea that people actually wrote up a law that I put out a more detailed one that deals with Posse Comitatus, Homeland Security, not just Patriot Act 1 and 2.
[02:33:59.022 --> 02:34:01.842]  And my provision has been passed by some cities and towns.
[02:34:03.103 --> 02:34:09.044]  In over 400 towns and cities and now four states, they have thrown out the Patriot Act.
[02:34:09.796 --> 02:34:17.778]  And other provisions, but that doesn't mean that the government still isn't violating our rights, but at least it shows a movement in the right direction.
[02:34:18.318 --> 02:34:24.619]  That's in the Save the Bill of Rights Campaign Patriot Act section of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:34:25.279 --> 02:34:26.039]  Okay, I'm sorry again.
[02:34:26.059 --> 02:34:28.340]  Where was it at?
[02:34:28.360 --> 02:34:30.940]  InfoWars... I'm aware of the website.
[02:34:31.420 --> 02:34:32.681]  Yeah, it's just on the website.
[02:34:33.001 --> 02:34:35.261]  Okay.
[02:34:35.301 --> 02:34:37.722]  Paul, where is that on Prison Planet if people want to find it?
[02:34:37.762 --> 02:34:38.842]  Where is my resolution?
[02:34:39.710 --> 02:34:52.615]  Well, actually, I think tonight or tomorrow we're posting a huge new activist section on prisonplanet.com, and it'll be in there along with contact details for media and public officials and, you know, what you can do to make a difference.
[02:34:52.655 --> 02:34:58.177]  So that'll probably go up either tonight or tomorrow, activist section, and it will be posted in there.
[02:35:00.318 --> 02:35:01.839]  Does that answer your question, Joe?
[02:35:01.919 --> 02:35:03.439]  That is exactly what I was looking for.
[02:35:04.260 --> 02:35:04.860]  Anything else?
[02:35:05.887 --> 02:35:06.687]  Nothing else.
[02:35:06.848 --> 02:35:12.129]  Kelly, like I said, I wish he would reconsider because what we're asking him to sue for is not for himself, it's for us.
[02:35:12.930 --> 02:35:15.291]  It's for the next person that this happens to and the next person.
[02:35:15.331 --> 02:35:18.532]  The statement has got to be made that this is not going to be tolerated.
[02:35:19.232 --> 02:35:30.416]  I mean, what's wrong with these officials, these authorities, that they think they need to arrest people for the yard sign that says our court system's a joke or for giving somebody a videotape?
[02:35:30.716 --> 02:35:31.756]  I mean, that's crazy.
[02:35:31.816 --> 02:35:33.017]  They need to move to Russia.
[02:35:33.979 --> 02:35:34.179]  Right.
[02:35:34.399 --> 02:35:37.541]  What's wrong with them is that they've done this and they've gotten away with it.
[02:35:37.902 --> 02:35:50.129]  What's wrong with them is that they've done this to people like Kelly and then people like Kelly have not turned around and had them face some type of monetary, for lack of any other sort of repercussion.
[02:35:50.530 --> 02:35:50.970]  I agree.
[02:35:51.010 --> 02:35:52.411]  They need the sleepless nights.
[02:35:52.471 --> 02:35:53.712]  They need to lose their jobs.
[02:35:53.772 --> 02:35:54.792]  They need to be sued.
[02:35:54.832 --> 02:35:58.135]  They need to be punished for engaging in this type of activity.
[02:35:58.515 --> 02:36:03.458]  So far, the limit of their punishment for what they've done to Kelly is they let him go back home.
[02:36:04.028 --> 02:36:05.308]  They have not suffered at all.
[02:36:06.329 --> 02:36:15.351]  And that's the reason they do it is because they could do it again and again and again and we do not come back and say, look, buddy, you're not going to just do this to me and send me back home.
[02:36:16.012 --> 02:36:16.972]  You're going to pay for this.
[02:36:17.612 --> 02:36:25.054]  And that's when it will begin to get the word around that, listen, you better not mess with these people because this is going to happen to you, this is going to happen to you.
[02:36:25.174 --> 02:36:27.735]  And we really need people like Kelly to follow through with this
[02:36:28.436 --> 02:36:29.797]  They falsely arrested him.
[02:36:29.817 --> 02:36:31.158]  They officially impressed him.
[02:36:31.178 --> 02:36:33.299]  I mean, that's what the law says.
[02:36:33.600 --> 02:36:34.260]  Thanks for the call.
[02:36:35.341 --> 02:36:36.502]  Hal in Florida.
[02:36:36.542 --> 02:36:37.342]  Hal, go ahead.
[02:36:38.243 --> 02:36:38.963]  Yes.
[02:36:39.243 --> 02:36:40.364]  Hello, Alex and Paul.
[02:36:41.045 --> 02:36:44.347]  I have a question for you two.
[02:36:44.647 --> 02:36:57.556]  Do you think it's possible that people who took the hostages in Iraq could really be CIA-connected and some associated and possibly impending atrocity by the captors
[02:36:58.382 --> 02:37:01.404]  Will be used for the de facto government's benefit.
[02:37:01.524 --> 02:37:02.764]  Okay, let me stop you.
[02:37:02.784 --> 02:37:04.445]  You must have missed Paul in the last hour.
[02:37:04.465 --> 02:37:06.346]  Go over evidence of that.
[02:37:07.667 --> 02:37:09.868]  I believe that some of the hostage-taking is real.
[02:37:10.757 --> 02:37:11.258]  We're good to go.
[02:37:36.161 --> 02:37:50.650]  Now evidence has come out that they basically put the mercenaries out there in the middle of nowhere and then told the radical Muslims where they were going to be and then had camera people there hours before to show them being hauled up on the bridge, their burned bodies.
[02:37:50.890 --> 02:37:53.212]  We know the Israelis, this is now admitted even in Israel,
[02:37:53.852 --> 02:37:56.454]  Stage the boy bomber with the fake suicide belt.
[02:37:57.555 --> 02:37:59.977]  The media says they were called hours before to be there.
[02:38:00.537 --> 02:38:02.059]  So we know there's a history of this.
[02:38:02.079 --> 02:38:07.303]  We have a Pentagon that plants fake letters from the troops in the newspapers of false signatures.
[02:38:07.643 --> 02:38:09.985]  So yes, Paul, answer that question.
[02:38:10.646 --> 02:38:13.847]  Yeah, well, as you mentioned, some of them might be real, some might be staged.
[02:38:14.047 --> 02:38:16.587]  The Chinese, seven Chinese hostages were released.
[02:38:16.627 --> 02:38:18.128]  The Russians were released today.
[02:38:18.588 --> 02:38:28.830]  But the thing with the Japanese hostages is that the group that kidnapped them said that they would be released on Saturday after, you know, saying you must pull out your troops within 24 hours.
[02:38:28.870 --> 02:38:32.991]  But then they just, they said, we got a call from the Muslim Council and now we're going to release them.
[02:38:33.351 --> 02:38:37.112]  But since then, we've had two other reports which said that they're going to kill them.
[02:38:37.132 --> 02:38:37.732]  And obviously now,
[02:38:38.172 --> 02:38:48.140]  We're getting into later on in Tuesday, early Wednesday in Japan, and those hostages are still there, so very interesting, but some of it may be staged, some of it may not be.
[02:38:48.620 --> 02:38:58.688]  With the thing in Fallujah, as you mentioned, the contractors who were killed were apparently, according to some people, set up to be there, which would then instigate all this violence.
[02:38:59.168 --> 02:39:06.052]  And again, today they're calling for al-Sadra to be assassinated, basically, which will only increase the violence.
[02:39:06.272 --> 02:39:11.595]  And the neocons at the same time are saying that al-Sadra is sponsored by Iran.
[02:39:11.735 --> 02:39:20.840]  So another reason to bomb Iran, even though the history of al-Sadra himself suggests that he's a nationalist and he has a history of non-cooperation with Iran.
[02:39:21.160 --> 02:39:26.603]  But the neocons are out there calling for Iran to be bombed because they're supposedly behind this uprising.
[02:39:27.717 --> 02:39:29.458]  Well, Iran's not the Shiites.
[02:39:30.798 --> 02:39:31.758]  I know, that's the point.
[02:39:32.399 --> 02:39:44.363]  There were stories about al-Sadr meeting with the Iranians, and the Iranians basically telling him to stop, cease all his activities, but the neocons pushed that to one side, and they're saying that it's all being supported from Iran.
[02:39:44.423 --> 02:39:51.505]  Well, late last week, the London Guardian had a very astute point about Blair and Bush trying to hype all this up, trying to have this happen.
[02:39:51.525 --> 02:39:52.946]  People said, well, why would they want that?
[02:39:53.624 --> 02:40:01.947]  Well, that's obvious, so that they have an excuse to never hand the government over, and then when they finally do partially do it, they can have the UN come in, Paul.
[02:40:02.767 --> 02:40:14.311]  Yeah, that June 30th handover, even though Bush a few days ago said it's still going to go ahead, obviously it's only going to go ahead if the UN are involved, which we've been saying for many months is the plan.
[02:40:14.771 --> 02:40:21.433]  So to create all this violence provides the pretext to prevent that June 30th handover from taking place.
[02:40:22.159 --> 02:40:25.441]  And now they're talking about injecting 80,000 additional troops.
[02:40:25.481 --> 02:40:27.082]  The other troops don't get to come home.
[02:40:27.542 --> 02:40:30.223]  I thought they said as soon as we got to Baghdad it was all over, Paul.
[02:40:31.544 --> 02:40:33.485]  Yeah, we've got calls for more troops to go in.
[02:40:34.505 --> 02:40:36.446]  Eventually they're going to run out of troops.
[02:40:37.127 --> 02:40:41.049]  North Korea a couple of days ago again saying that they're on the brink of nuclear war.
[02:40:41.089 --> 02:40:45.211]  We know that, you know, North Korea are bellicose and they make these kind of statements all the time.
[02:40:45.251 --> 02:40:49.053]  But, you know, they've got the nukes to back it up and we know who sold them to themselves.
[02:40:49.073 --> 02:40:51.554]  And now we've got Cheney selling more nukes.
[02:40:52.486 --> 02:40:53.347]  Yep.
[02:40:53.748 --> 02:40:55.530]  By the way, it was on the news last night.
[02:40:56.171 --> 02:40:57.092]  I just saw a blip.
[02:40:57.172 --> 02:41:02.660]  It was a Halliburton employee going, I got $80,000 a year to go, and it's tax-free, so that's why I went.
[02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:05.683]  I mean, if you work for Halliburton, you don't have to pay taxes?
[02:41:05.704 --> 02:41:07.185]  I mean, this is getting sick, Paul.
[02:41:07.205 --> 02:41:07.606]  Go ahead.
[02:41:08.888 --> 02:41:09.669]  Yeah, I was actually...
[02:41:10.347 --> 02:41:16.829]  This whole supporting the troops thing, it's amazing because, I mean, it goes back to the Kelly rushing thing.
[02:41:16.889 --> 02:41:24.832]  It's about criticising the government and all these police officers are listening to these neocon hosts like Limbaugh and Savage saying that it's illegal to criticise the government.
[02:41:25.252 --> 02:41:34.535]  And I was listening to the Drudge report on Sunday night and they had a journalist on from Newsday called Pinkerton who is a conservative and he was speaking out against Bush.
[02:41:34.995 --> 02:41:38.816]  The next caller called in and said that he should be shut down for what he's saying because...
[02:41:39.964 --> 02:41:44.227]  The people that our troops are fighting flew planes into buildings.
[02:41:44.608 --> 02:41:54.777]  So we've still got 50% of American people who think that Iraqis and Al-Qaeda are the same entity and that Saddam Hussein is Osama bin Laden.
[02:41:55.297 --> 02:42:05.907]  So it's all a whirlpool of... And we have a national host every day saying if anyone disagrees with the government, put them in a camp and a large portion of the population thinks that's America now.
[02:42:07.211 --> 02:42:15.996]  Yeah, these police officers are listening to that, and that's why we get things like the Kelly Rushing case taking place, where it's a terrorism to criticize the government.
[02:42:17.197 --> 02:42:17.817]  He didn't even do that!
[02:42:17.837 --> 02:42:19.238]  The video doesn't even do that.
[02:42:19.258 --> 02:42:20.539]  It just exposes corruption.
[02:42:21.539 --> 02:42:22.400]  These people are nuts.
[02:42:22.820 --> 02:42:24.081]  Let's go ahead and last call.
[02:42:24.121 --> 02:42:26.082]  All I have time for, we've got to cover some final news here.
[02:42:26.382 --> 02:42:27.243]  Gabe in Texas.
[02:42:27.283 --> 02:42:27.943]  Gabe, go ahead.
[02:42:28.623 --> 02:42:30.384]  Hey Alex, I've got a couple quick things.
[02:42:30.424 --> 02:42:32.686]  First I want to talk about Operation Mockingbird.
[02:42:33.959 --> 02:42:34.199]  I think so.
[02:42:53.520 --> 02:42:55.360]  He said, oh yeah, I think Bush is going to win the election.
[02:42:55.380 --> 02:43:01.202]  This infuriated me, so I went ahead and called in to that show, and as soon as he said, what do you want to talk about?
[02:43:01.222 --> 02:43:05.523]  He supposedly doesn't screen his calls, but I said, I want to talk about Operation Paperclip.
[02:43:05.923 --> 02:43:08.363]  Then he slammed the phone down.
[02:43:08.383 --> 02:43:09.723]  He didn't even want to talk about it.
[02:43:10.124 --> 02:43:11.604]  He wanted to talk about Chupacabras, I guess.
[02:43:11.884 --> 02:43:17.245]  But my question to you is, I'm listening to you on Free Radio Austin, which is an unlicensed radio station.
[02:43:17.905 --> 02:43:21.586]  Why do you think that Free Radio Austin hasn't been shut down yet?
[02:43:22.714 --> 02:43:24.695]  Well, I don't really know any of the details about it.
[02:43:25.115 --> 02:43:36.601]  In the history of Austin, I've been on several commercial AM and FM stations, but also in the history of Austin, going back, oh, seven, eight years, there have been unlicensed stations.
[02:43:37.021 --> 02:43:39.663]  And there's other unlicensed stations that don't carry this show.
[02:43:39.823 --> 02:43:44.885]  There's a whole other one here in town that carries whatever that noise is.
[02:43:44.905 --> 02:43:48.187]  I mean, there's some good political stuff on it, but mainly it's like punk rock music.
[02:43:48.746 --> 02:43:50.627]  Yeah, I remember the other one, Free Radio Austin.
[02:43:50.687 --> 02:43:54.530]  That was shut down right when the Fortune 500 protest came a couple years ago.
[02:43:54.570 --> 02:43:55.871]  Yeah, that happened.
[02:43:55.891 --> 02:43:58.172]  And see, that was another group that doesn't carry this show.
[02:43:58.232 --> 02:44:06.618]  So there have just been a lot of micros out there, and I think as long as they don't interfere with commercial broadcast, it's constitutional and a great public service.
[02:44:07.719 --> 02:44:12.322]  But there are just so many of them popping up around the country now, there's nothing the government can do.
[02:44:14.252 --> 02:44:15.953]  You see, we really have the power.
[02:44:17.653 --> 02:44:18.594]  We have the power.
[02:44:19.094 --> 02:44:28.818]  Well, the thing is, they went after Freelander Austin because it was serving as a hub of information for the protests that were going to occur in November, I think it was a couple years ago.
[02:44:28.838 --> 02:44:29.698]  You remember that?
[02:44:29.938 --> 02:44:31.139]  I think you were there with a bullhorn, screaming.
[02:44:31.159 --> 02:44:31.539]  I remember that.
[02:44:31.559 --> 02:44:32.719]  You were there with that bullhorn, too.
[02:44:32.759 --> 02:44:33.920]  Yeah, I was at the bullhorn, too.
[02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:38.762]  Yeah, they also, that same week, went after one of the micros that was carrying this show and just sent them a letter.
[02:44:38.802 --> 02:44:41.503]  But, yeah, I appreciate your call, Gabe.
[02:44:42.043 --> 02:44:42.583]  I really do.
[02:44:42.663 --> 02:44:45.205]  But, yeah, there's so many of these micros.
[02:44:45.545 --> 02:44:49.466]  The government calls them pirates, but I think it's a public service.
[02:44:51.733 --> 02:44:57.497]  Yeah, when the Fortune 500 came to town, the government went out and shut them all down, but they just popped back up like mushrooms.
[02:44:57.658 --> 02:45:01.581]  I think every time they shut one down, like three more pop up.
[02:45:02.882 --> 02:45:04.263]  It's pretty funny, actually.
[02:45:05.143 --> 02:45:09.467]  But so many of them, I don't even know the details of it.
[02:45:10.107 --> 02:45:13.830]  Paul Watson, I want to air these Lone Diamond clips again.
[02:45:14.833 --> 02:45:19.097]  Because the computer had a brain hiccup during the last one.
[02:45:19.117 --> 02:45:26.903]  But before we do that, again, why should people get your book, Ordered Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror in the New World Order, in 60 seconds?
[02:45:27.884 --> 02:45:37.973]  Because it's very successful in waking people up who are just being introduced to this information, and in fact people who have never come into contact with any of this kind of information.
[02:45:38.593 --> 02:45:48.943]  Two military people who were in the military in my family read it and completely changed, you know, full spin on the fact before they were calling me a conspiracy theorist.
[02:45:49.023 --> 02:45:57.752]  After they read the book, they actually apologized to me because it's so well documented that basically you can't argue with it and everyone can check out the sources for themselves.
[02:45:59.537 --> 02:46:02.518]  And it's 320-something pages long, $19.95.
[02:46:04.099 --> 02:46:08.201]  When you buy one, take advantage of the deal, $11.95 for a second copy.
[02:46:08.621 --> 02:46:14.464]  And that goes to support Paul and his work that he does for us at PrisonPlanet.com and also supports our ministry.
[02:46:15.644 --> 02:46:16.665]  I've made 10 films.
[02:46:16.685 --> 02:46:17.685]  They're all excellent.
[02:46:18.125 --> 02:46:19.106]  I've also written a book.
[02:46:19.146 --> 02:46:22.887]  We carry other great books and videos by other wonderful authors and researchers.
[02:46:23.868 --> 02:46:28.270]  Paul, just randomly here, what videos do you think people should get from me?
[02:46:29.455 --> 02:46:36.904]  They should get 9-1-1 Road to Tyranny because obviously it's the best produced in a kind of CNN fashion.
[02:46:36.924 --> 02:46:39.828]  A lot of people trust that, you know, that slick presentation.
[02:46:40.648 --> 02:46:45.995]  Matrix of Evil because it shows people getting active and speaking out, getting out on the field.
[02:46:47.168 --> 02:46:57.398]  So those two, and then Bohemian Grove, which exposes the true mentality of the elite that we're fighting against, because, you know, it exposes the pagan occultic origins.
[02:46:57.458 --> 02:47:02.724]  So 9-1-1, Road to Tyranny, Matrix of Evil, and Bohemian Grove would be the three that I would get.
[02:47:03.885 --> 02:47:05.367]  And again, folks, I've made ten films.
[02:47:05.547 --> 02:47:07.029]  They're $25.95 apiece.
[02:47:07.549 --> 02:47:08.310]  Twenty dollars.
[02:47:09.093 --> 02:47:14.697]  If you order three or more, the toll-free number to order the books, the videos, the t-shirts, all of it, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:47:14.737 --> 02:47:15.057]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:47:15.097 --> 02:47:20.341]  Or prisonplanet.com or infowars.com to order via our secure, safe online shopping cart.
[02:47:20.361 --> 02:47:22.642]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001...
[02:47:34.404 --> 02:47:38.566]  Self Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:47:40.247 --> 02:47:43.288]  Stephanie, which clip do you have from Alone, Gum, and First for people?
[02:47:45.249 --> 02:47:49.911]  Okay, I want to air the second one first, and then we'll air the first one after that in the next segment.
[02:47:50.271 --> 02:47:59.855]  This is from a nationally televised TV show where a secret government group has hijacked a jet to fly it into the World Trade Center full of passengers to blame it on foreign enemies.
[02:48:00.255 --> 02:48:01.456]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[02:48:02.543 --> 02:48:03.403]  Did you find anything?
[02:48:03.423 --> 02:48:04.364]  The luggage hold's clear.
[02:48:04.404 --> 02:48:05.404]  This thing can be trusted.
[02:48:05.904 --> 02:48:06.244]  What'd you do?
[02:48:06.284 --> 02:48:07.285]  Make it with your erector, sir?
[02:48:07.305 --> 02:48:09.846]  You're absolutely sure that this is the targeted flight?
[02:48:10.126 --> 02:48:12.647]  This flight was chosen primarily for its visibility.
[02:48:13.127 --> 02:48:15.408]  It's scheduled to pass on Manhattan on to Boston.
[02:48:18.169 --> 02:48:21.810]  You said they intend to bring us down in the middle of New York City?
[02:48:23.771 --> 02:48:24.651]  What if there is no bomb?
[02:48:26.892 --> 02:48:27.973]  Well, how are they gonna bring it down?
[02:48:29.273 --> 02:48:30.894]  Same way a dead man can drive a car.
[02:48:36.078 --> 02:48:37.138]  What do you mean, though, Bob?
[02:48:37.158 --> 02:48:43.821]  Langley, I need you to hack into the aircraft's onboard navigation system.
[02:48:45.001 --> 02:48:47.082]  We need to know where we're headed.
[02:48:47.102 --> 02:48:47.842]  Okay, go into headsets.
[02:48:48.102 --> 02:48:49.123]  I'll clone the airplane's carrier.
[02:48:49.143 --> 02:48:50.543]  Make them think we're sending a ground air fax.
[02:48:50.603 --> 02:48:51.363]  That's one twisted star 69.
[02:48:51.484 --> 02:48:53.624]  Well, just get ready to ride the plane, you people.
[02:48:53.644 --> 02:48:55.725]  Just get me on that plane and I'll get you autopilot access.
[02:48:55.785 --> 02:48:56.945]  How are you going to do that?
[02:48:56.965 --> 02:49:00.607]  Airline telemetry systems use processors similar to those found in TV radios.
[02:49:00.627 --> 02:49:01.907]  I'm in.
[02:49:01.927 --> 02:49:03.608]  We've got ourselves a convoy.
[02:49:04.611 --> 02:49:05.252]  What's your progress?
[02:49:05.592 --> 02:49:07.794]  I hacked into the flight control system output.
[02:49:07.814 --> 02:49:08.794]  What's that little bit of help?
[02:49:08.935 --> 02:49:11.236]  It's what the brains of the plane is telling the little black box.
[02:49:11.316 --> 02:49:14.239]  Force, heading, attitude, hold, yaw, axis, stabilization.
[02:49:14.259 --> 02:49:14.519]  What?
[02:49:16.701 --> 02:49:17.361]  What the heck's that?
[02:49:17.922 --> 02:49:18.702]  Is that what it looks like?
[02:49:20.824 --> 02:49:21.805]  I think it is what it looks like.
[02:49:21.925 --> 02:49:23.226]  What does what look like?
[02:49:23.626 --> 02:49:24.427]  Oh, no, protocol.
[02:49:24.887 --> 02:49:25.668]  Remote access.
[02:49:25.708 --> 02:49:27.209]  Somebody on the ground is flying your plane.
[02:49:28.009 --> 02:49:28.510]  Hold you, sir.
[02:49:28.890 --> 02:49:29.651]  Keep your course.
[02:49:34.525 --> 02:49:37.826]  We need to know our flight plan.
[02:49:38.066 --> 02:49:42.668]  I'm mapping the data now.
[02:49:42.768 --> 02:49:51.372]  Fires, your flight's gonna make an unscheduled stop in exactly 22 minutes.
[02:49:53.233 --> 02:49:55.294]  The corner of Liberty and Washington.
[02:49:56.294 --> 02:49:56.994]  More than half.
[02:49:57.775 --> 02:49:58.295]  More than 3,500.
[02:49:59.776 --> 02:50:01.477]  I'm going to crash the plane into the World Trade Center.
[02:50:02.497 --> 02:50:03.518]  I'll tell the flight crew.
[02:50:03.858 --> 02:50:06.699]  Manly, can you override the flight control system?
[02:50:08.520 --> 02:50:10.001]  The World Trade Center, Paul!
[02:50:10.061 --> 02:50:13.102]  The secret government group wants to do it to get a police state going.
[02:50:13.122 --> 02:50:14.743]  I wonder why they aired that.
[02:50:15.327 --> 02:50:16.287]  No, it's just a coincidence.
[02:50:16.307 --> 02:50:31.013]  We've got an entire section on prisonplanet.com called Anecdotal Prior Knowledge, and it's right at the bottom, which includes that clip and several other pieces of evidence like it, like the Spanish cartoon released in 92, which shows a plane flying into the World Trade Center.
[02:50:32.513 --> 02:50:35.634]  But Condoleezza Rice, no one had ever imagined, Paul.
[02:50:37.315 --> 02:50:38.775]  No one had ever imagined.
[02:50:38.835 --> 02:50:40.036]  Only all the government drills.
[02:50:40.076 --> 02:50:40.736]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:43.112 --> 02:50:50.498]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:50:50.778 --> 02:50:55.502]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:50:55.742 --> 02:51:01.387]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:51:01.647 --> 02:51:06.150]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:51:06.370 --> 02:51:13.535]  The casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:51:13.555 --> 02:51:18.078]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:51:18.238 --> 02:51:20.759]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masses of terror.
[02:51:20.980 --> 02:51:27.704]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:51:27.924 --> 02:51:33.186]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:51:33.206 --> 02:51:33.626]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:51:42.185 --> 02:51:46.089]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:51:46.329 --> 02:51:51.754]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:51:52.034 --> 02:52:02.404]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:52:02.584 --> 02:52:06.908]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:52:07.088 --> 02:52:15.452]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:52:15.713 --> 02:52:22.056]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[02:52:22.196 --> 02:52:22.436]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:52:43.365 --> 02:52:49.274]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:52:49.514 --> 02:52:51.757]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:52:51.958 --> 02:52:58.327]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:52:58.607 --> 02:52:59.287]  We're good to go.
[02:53:28.163 --> 02:53:31.264]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:53:31.424 --> 02:53:37.425]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:53:46.408 --> 02:53:49.709]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time, back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:53:49.749 --> 02:53:50.149]  until 2 p.m.
[02:53:51.687 --> 02:53:59.034]  Not just on your AM and FM dial, but on the Internet and global shortwave during the day, 94.75 in the night, 9 to midnight, all three hours, 3210.
[02:54:01.537 --> 02:53:59.034]  3210.
[02:54:02.258 --> 02:54:04.840]  Let's hit that next clip from the lone gunman.
[02:54:04.860 --> 02:54:07.543]  In this clip, they talk about why they're doing it.
[02:54:08.844 --> 02:54:11.287]  And then he says, well, I'd like to put this in our newspaper.
[02:54:11.307 --> 02:54:12.388]  And they said, oh, they're not, you know.
[02:54:13.354 --> 02:54:14.595]  You won't be taken seriously.
[02:54:15.615 --> 02:54:21.038]  So the point is, is you can even throw it in their face beforehand, they'll still go ahead and carry out their terror attacks.
[02:54:21.058 --> 02:54:28.841]  So here they are describing who the terrorists are, how they're going to use a drill as a smoke screen to do it, and how it's really an element of the government.
[02:54:28.901 --> 02:54:29.361]  Here it is.
[02:54:29.782 --> 02:54:31.182]  What is Scenario 12D?
[02:54:34.044 --> 02:54:38.706]  We know it's a war game scenario, and it has to do with airline counterterrorism.
[02:54:40.146 --> 02:54:41.487]  Why is it important enough to kill for?
[02:54:42.267 --> 02:54:43.628]  Because it's no longer a game.
[02:54:45.869 --> 02:54:52.213]  If some terrorist group wants to act out this scenario, why target you for assassination?
[02:54:52.553 --> 02:54:54.254]  Depends on who your terrorists are.
[02:54:56.335 --> 02:54:58.036]  The men who conceived of it in the first place.
[02:55:00.477 --> 02:55:04.099]  You're saying our government plans to commit a terrorist act against a domestic heirloom?
[02:55:04.119 --> 02:55:04.520]  There you go.
[02:55:04.900 --> 02:55:06.621]  And dying the entire government, as usual.
[02:55:06.641 --> 02:55:07.781]  It's a faction.
[02:55:08.162 --> 02:55:09.182]  A small faction.
[02:55:09.222 --> 02:55:10.303]  For what possible gain?
[02:55:11.397 --> 02:55:12.898]  The Cold War's over, John.
[02:55:13.578 --> 02:55:16.720]  But with no clear enemy to stockpile against, the arms market's flat.
[02:55:17.280 --> 02:55:29.367]  But bring down a fully loaded 727 into the middle of New York City, and you'll find a dozen tin-pot dictators all over the world just clamoring to take responsibility and begging to be smart-bombed.
[02:55:29.828 --> 02:55:30.348]  I can't believe it.
[02:55:30.688 --> 02:55:32.269]  This is about increasing our sales.
[02:55:35.051 --> 02:55:35.271]  When?
[02:55:36.231 --> 02:55:36.572]  Tonight.
[02:55:38.132 --> 02:55:38.993]  How are you going to stop them?
[02:55:41.826 --> 02:55:43.127]  Why didn't you tell the world this?
[02:55:43.387 --> 02:55:44.087]  Go to the press!
[02:55:44.427 --> 02:55:47.189]  You think I'd still be drawing breath 30 minutes after I made that call?
[02:55:47.809 --> 02:55:48.329]  The press?
[02:55:48.829 --> 02:55:49.850]  Who's going to run this story?
[02:55:50.130 --> 02:55:50.610]  We would.
[02:55:50.890 --> 02:55:51.151]  This?
[02:55:54.732 --> 02:55:56.133]  This is birdcage liner.
[02:55:56.693 --> 02:56:01.035]  Wild-eyed crap right up there with Elvis as an alien and two-headed babies.
[02:56:01.275 --> 02:56:02.116]  Obviously read it.
[02:56:02.596 --> 02:56:04.117]  Don't be so damn naive.
[02:56:04.858 --> 02:56:08.783]  All right, we apologize for that mild language, but it's historical, and we're documenting what they did.
[02:56:09.343 --> 02:56:15.210]  When I air the LBJ clips, some of them I can't even air because there's stuff worse in there, but it's important just for the record to have that.
[02:56:15.650 --> 02:56:19.134]  This is what they're broadcasting during the family hour on television, in your face.
[02:56:20.376 --> 02:56:23.059]  Paul, final comments concerning all of this.
[02:56:23.954 --> 02:56:37.951]  Well, on top of that, the second series of 24, the port was where Nevada got nuked, and it turned out that the group controlling the terrorists was within the government, and it was carrying out the terrorism to control the world's oil supply.
[02:56:38.371 --> 02:56:40.554]  So, again and again, they do this.
[02:56:41.235 --> 02:56:43.017]  But the final point would be that
[02:56:43.590 --> 02:57:00.273]  The criminals know that we're watching them because I was doing, I typed in Larry Silverstein into Google because I was just doing some research on it and eight of the first ten links that pop up for Larry Silverstein before his own website are about how, you know, he blew up World Trade Center 7.
[02:57:00.553 --> 02:57:13.256]  So, I mean, Larry Silverstein's got to have done the same thing so it tells us that he knows it and that all the other criminals know that we're watching them like hawks and that's why they're now backing off and kind of afraid to do anything out in the open.
[02:57:14.190 --> 02:57:18.852]  Why did Silverstein go on TV and say we blew up WTC7 and then no one points it out?
[02:57:19.933 --> 02:57:37.002]  I don't know why he did it, whether it was a slip-up or intentional for some other purpose, but the facts are there that he admits it, and what's more surprising is that nobody, not even us, picked up on it for over a year after, because it came out September 2002, the documentary, so amazing stuff.
[02:57:38.078 --> 02:57:39.299]  Well, we covered a lot today.
[02:57:39.319 --> 02:57:42.121]  It was always, as usual, good to have you on the show.
[02:57:42.141 --> 02:57:44.222]  You'll be back with us, what, next Monday or next Tuesday?
[02:57:44.842 --> 02:57:46.483]  Well, next Monday, April 19th.
[02:57:46.503 --> 02:57:49.885]  Let's hope that we have nothing big to talk about on that date.
[02:57:50.886 --> 02:57:51.887]  Yeah, I hope so.
[02:57:52.187 --> 02:57:54.168]  And good to have you on with us.
[02:57:54.188 --> 02:57:55.009]  God bless, my friend.
[02:57:56.330 --> 02:57:57.170]  We're out of time.
[02:57:57.210 --> 02:57:59.692]  Again, back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:57:59.712 --> 02:58:00.012]  That's 10 p.m.
[02:58:00.052 --> 02:58:00.172]  to 1 a.m.
[02:58:00.192 --> 02:58:00.372]  Eastern.
[02:58:00.412 --> 02:58:01.393]  Or 8 to 11 Mountain, 7 to 10 Pacific.
[02:58:07.069 --> 02:58:08.229]  Again, be sure and join us.
[02:58:08.489 --> 02:58:10.530]  And to everybody out there, this stuff is scary.
[02:58:11.070 --> 02:58:12.950]  It is scary, but this is the history of the world.
[02:58:13.650 --> 02:58:17.691]  And the history of the world is good people finally standing up against tyrants and backing them down.
[02:58:18.391 --> 02:58:19.072]  It's up to you.
[02:58:19.132 --> 02:58:27.893]  We're all going to have better, healthier, more secure lives if we grow some porcupine spines on our backs and stop being pushover wimps.
[02:58:28.393 --> 02:58:29.914]  So stand up and fight the New World Order.
[02:58:29.954 --> 02:58:30.594]  God bless you all.
[02:58:32.643 --> 02:58:35.904]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:58:35.964 --> 02:58:40.145]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:58:40.385 --> 02:58:43.165]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:58:43.365 --> 02:58:45.766]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:58:45.966 --> 02:58:54.608]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:58:54.788 --> 02:58:56.148]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:58:56.348 --> 02:59:00.469]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:59:00.829 --> 02:59:01.030]  I think.
[02:59:19.787 --> 02:59:22.593]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:59:22.613 --> 02:59:23.495]  Not yet available in Iowa.
