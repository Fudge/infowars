[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.260]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.001]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.701 --> 00:00:09.821]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.461 --> 00:00:11.281]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:12.942]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.602 --> 00:00:17.263]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.783 --> 00:00:21.864]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.047 --> 00:00:45.088]  Alright, it's Monday yet again, a whole other week spanning out before us.
[00:00:46.408 --> 00:01:06.893]  Coming up in a little while, we have a writer coming on the broadcast to talk about the Pentagon running recruitment ads for psychological warfare experts to run operations out of NORTHCOM in Colorado, our new military martial law command center.
[00:01:08.286 --> 00:01:17.009]  And how that feeds into the Pentagon Office of Strategic Information two years ago that said they were going to lie to us for our own good.
[00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:31.453]  And then we'll go over some examples of the military violating every canon of a free society, every section of the Bill of Rights and Constitution, and engaging in this for their private corporate owners.
[00:01:32.273 --> 00:01:35.434]  The same private corporate owners that funded Adolf Hitler,
[00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:54.063]  Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, Pol Pot, Fidel Castro, Ho Chi Minh, they build them up, they knock them down, or they try to knock them down, and they create crises, whether it's Noriega or Bin Laden or Saddam.
[00:01:55.064 --> 00:02:01.068]  In every one of those cases I listed, it's now admitted that our government helped put them into power and helped keep them there.
[00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:01.609]  Did you know that?
[00:02:02.483 --> 00:02:07.145]  History Channel has old CIA section chiefs on just admitting it.
[00:02:07.865 --> 00:02:13.128]  You know, when a communist leader dies, old David Rockefeller will write an editorial for the New York Times.
[00:02:14.528 --> 00:02:17.569]  He said, we've got to praise Mao.
[00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:18.490]  He did a great job.
[00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:29.374]  And now they're building that here in America in the name of fighting the endless boogeyman who can never be defeated, Al-Qaeda.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.820]  Or Al-Ci-Ada.
[00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:50.143]  Some of the news that's coming up, and we're also going to have wide open phones, draft riots feared, that's conscription riots feared, no matter who wins the November election, draft will return.
[00:02:50.944 --> 00:02:52.684]  This is from American Free Press.
[00:02:54.104 --> 00:02:57.845]  They've got their bills introduced, their draft board set back up, we'll go over it.
[00:02:57.925 --> 00:03:02.686]  Also, protection or paranoia, why is the Secret Service treating harmless professors
[00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:07.491]  And pacifist homeless advocates like they're members of Al-Qaeda.
[00:03:08.131 --> 00:03:22.778]  And this is by Justin Rude in Salon, the same guy that wrote the article about the Pentagon running ads for people to get positions running disinformation operations here in the U.S.
[00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:27.241]  The big news, of course, we'll cover first when we get back.
[00:03:27.861 --> 00:03:29.962]  Satan to monitor Lucifer.
[00:03:30.888 --> 00:03:32.310]  Now that's my own headline.
[00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:43.046]  I added this to the top of the posting we did of a CNN article, Satan to Monitor Lucifer, and of course their headline, UN Body to Monitor U.S.
[00:03:43.326 --> 00:03:44.007]  Elections.
[00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.700]  And I wrote, here's a perfect example of the controlled left-right paradigm.
[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.581]  Everybody knows that our elections are a fraud, so they send in the United Nations to, quote, save us.
[00:03:56.041 --> 00:04:03.842]  This promotes the UN as a global government authority, and will give the phony conservatives something to act anti-UN about.
[00:04:05.362 --> 00:04:09.503]  Again, it will give them something fake to hop around about.
[00:04:10.643 --> 00:04:13.484]  International team to monitor presidential elections.
[00:04:13.564 --> 00:04:13.824]  Again...
[00:04:15.262 --> 00:04:17.904]  Beelzebub to monitor Moloch.
[00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:22.547]  Or should I say Stalin to monitor Hitler?
[00:04:23.648 --> 00:04:26.590]  Or should I say left hand to monitor right hand?
[00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.752]  Or Fox to guard the henhouse from the weasels?
[00:04:31.093 --> 00:04:32.774]  I don't know, which cliche would you like?
[00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:34.736]  But I like my new one I've invented.
[00:04:35.196 --> 00:04:36.877]  Satan to monitor Lucifer.
[00:04:37.878 --> 00:04:40.339]  UN body to monitor U.S.
[00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:41.000]  elections.
[00:04:42.834 --> 00:04:48.718]  We'll be right back and we'll get into all the other news.
[00:04:48.938 --> 00:04:53.641]  Nuclear reactors blowing up in Japan and everything else.
[00:04:54.081 --> 00:04:54.821]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:54.841 --> 00:04:55.262]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.047 --> 00:05:03.868]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[00:05:04.008 --> 00:05:04.828]  Michael Trudeau here.
[00:05:04.968 --> 00:05:08.249]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:14.111]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[00:05:14.251 --> 00:05:17.272]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[00:05:17.532 --> 00:05:21.814]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[00:05:21.994 --> 00:05:23.915]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[00:05:24.035 --> 00:05:31.098]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again, with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[00:05:31.278 --> 00:05:33.759]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:34.640]  We're good to go.
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.040]  We're good to go.
[00:06:02.498 --> 00:06:03.539]  The war on terrorism.
[00:06:03.859 --> 00:06:06.642]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:06.902 --> 00:06:11.066]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.486 --> 00:06:12.327]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.648 --> 00:06:17.192]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.692 --> 00:06:19.813]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:35.016]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:35.036 --> 00:06:42.098]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:42.458 --> 00:06:46.862]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:06:47.302 --> 00:06:49.083]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.103 --> 00:06:49.283]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.323 --> 00:06:50.364]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:06:50.384 --> 00:06:52.746]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.941]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:11.885]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:17.428]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:07:17.708 --> 00:07:21.831]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:07:22.031 --> 00:07:25.795]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:07:26.076 --> 00:07:30.701]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:37.068]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:07:37.108 --> 00:07:38.930]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.492]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.
[00:07:41.572 --> 00:07:44.934]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:45.255 --> 00:07:47.977]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:48.717 --> 00:07:53.060]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.222]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[00:07:55.442 --> 00:07:56.963]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:59.245]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.301]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.961 --> 00:08:08.022]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.742 --> 00:08:09.863]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.484 --> 00:08:11.324]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.065 --> 00:08:12.945]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.965 --> 00:08:17.288]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.829 --> 00:08:21.912]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:29.917 --> 00:08:33.560]  All right, I'm going to get into the United Nations EU body.
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.182]  This isn't just the UN, it's a EU body.
[00:08:38.663 --> 00:08:42.506]  Coming over here to monitor our elections, I think it's absolutely horrible.
[00:08:44.067 --> 00:08:50.151]  But I think that the response we're going to get from neocons to this is also absolutely horrible.
[00:08:50.972 --> 00:08:54.194]  So we'll get into the propaganda facets of this.
[00:08:56.566 --> 00:08:58.867]  Hundreds have already rallied against the U.N.
[00:08:58.907 --> 00:08:59.868]  monitoring of U.S.
[00:08:59.928 --> 00:09:00.488]  elections.
[00:09:01.188 --> 00:09:04.550]  We're going to be getting some of those folks on, but again, they're monitoring for the wrong reasons.
[00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.771]  They're protesting for the wrong reasons.
[00:09:08.972 --> 00:09:12.373]  Congress may put more power in the Intel post.
[00:09:12.853 --> 00:09:19.976]  Here's another shill article out of the Kansas City Star saying that Bush is a little upset.
[00:09:20.176 --> 00:09:21.177]  He may not want...
[00:09:22.154 --> 00:09:31.398]  This giant independent intelligence czar that has outside funding, and he may not want Congress to sign over all its control.
[00:09:32.658 --> 00:09:35.019]  Funny, that's what he proposed a year ago.
[00:09:35.039 --> 00:09:38.681]  That's what the 9-11 Whitewash Commission proposed.
[00:09:40.421 --> 00:09:47.004]  As it was being formed, they said, oh, we're going to call for Patriot Act II and a giant domestic intelligence agency.
[00:09:47.724 --> 00:09:49.385]  And then, oh, we're not going to try to
[00:09:50.106 --> 00:09:52.127]  Find blame in government.
[00:09:52.147 --> 00:09:55.349]  We're going to try to find out how to stop this from happening again.
[00:09:56.669 --> 00:09:57.610]  Well, that's how you do it.
[00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.591]  You find blame and fire those people.
[00:09:59.831 --> 00:10:01.392]  That's how it works everywhere else.
[00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:21.243]  I mean, in our Navy, up until just a few decades ago, if you lost an action or you screwed something up, you got kicked out of the Navy or you got sent to the shore or if a politician messed something up or a dam operator opened the wrong floodgate and flooded a town, they got fired.
[00:10:21.744 --> 00:10:23.225]  Not anymore in America, folks.
[00:10:23.245 --> 00:10:26.387]  We've actually found that if you screw something up, you get rewarded.
[00:10:29.272 --> 00:10:31.853]  But again, we know 9-11 isn't screwing something up.
[00:10:31.954 --> 00:10:43.500]  Actually, those that carried out 9-11, those that got the passports for the supposed hijackers, and those that blocked FBI agents from doing their jobs, they all got bonuses and promoted.
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:51.985]  And those that tried to fight Al-CIA, that got kicked out of the FBI or the CIA, or got demoted and didn't get those big record cash bonuses.
[00:10:52.025 --> 00:10:53.205]  But again, that's a side issue.
[00:10:53.966 --> 00:10:58.128]  Congress may put more power in Intel Post, and Bush may not like it.
[00:10:59.013 --> 00:11:03.560]  Also, I'm sure you've heard America's Bogus Beheading Video, Dupes International Media.
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:04.963]  This is out of the City Morning Herald.
[00:11:06.185 --> 00:11:10.252]  I have one here out of Reuters, FBI Probes Hoax Video of Iraq Beheading.
[00:11:11.943 --> 00:11:12.964]  And it's very interesting.
[00:11:13.004 --> 00:11:16.906]  In the big headlines in major newspapers, it just says the guy did it as a joke.
[00:11:16.986 --> 00:11:29.915]  But when you read deeper in the Reuters and AP News stories that never made it in the newspaper, he says that he wanted to show how the government could fake one of these videos or how some other group could do it and how easy this is to do.
[00:11:30.275 --> 00:11:32.357]  And he went to one of the supposed Islamicist...
[00:11:33.177 --> 00:11:47.321]  We've already proven the Nick Berg video is fake.
[00:11:47.621 --> 00:11:50.582]  We've already proven the fat bin Laden in the dark room is fake.
[00:11:50.842 --> 00:11:56.123]  We've already proven fake Niger documents, fake weapons documents, fake, fake, fake.
[00:11:56.663 --> 00:11:59.664]  And it turns out the latest terror alerts are four years old, but...
[00:12:00.419 --> 00:12:02.521]  So we'll get into that story, too.
[00:12:02.541 --> 00:12:23.416]  And then, of course, in Japan, there was a radiation release, part of a reactor blew, and sprayed a bunch of high-level radioactive particles onto the workers there.
[00:12:23.436 --> 00:12:28.760]  And at least four are dead, according to the Associated Press.
[00:12:29.662 --> 00:12:29.962]  Press.
[00:12:29.982 --> 00:12:35.226]  Now, they say a non-radioactive steam leak killed four people and injured seven others.
[00:12:36.307 --> 00:12:39.530]  But then another article says it was radioactive, so you can believe whatever they say.
[00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:42.912]  Remember about, what, six, seven years ago, they even had video of it?
[00:12:43.853 --> 00:12:54.501]  Japanese hand-stirring giant buckets of highly radioactive materials at one of their power plants, and then
[00:12:55.419 --> 00:13:00.060]  Then it was reported that they were actually getting into the buckets with their feet and meeting it.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.241]  This is the self-sacrifice of the Japanese, folks.
[00:13:03.481 --> 00:13:07.262]  There's a lot of weird, secretive stuff going on in Japan that nobody really knows about.
[00:13:07.963 --> 00:13:23.907]  I know that last year, and then the year before that, Japan started threatening to nuke North Korea, and then their government called for developing nuclear weapons covertly, which was kind of strange, calling for developing nuclear weapons covertly, but announcing it publicly.
[00:13:24.945 --> 00:13:30.406]  So imagine what they do with cameras and computers and automobiles.
[00:13:30.466 --> 00:13:33.067]  Imagine that put to use in developing nuclear weapons.
[00:13:33.127 --> 00:13:39.468]  They have more nuclear reactors than any other country in the world, not just per capita, but period.
[00:13:40.308 --> 00:13:46.349]  And there's all sorts of bizarre, clandestine stuff going on in Japan, where they, by the way, have also legalized cloning.
[00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:54.291]  And now Japan is talking about getting rid of its pacifist constitution and
[00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:58.965]  Talking about building a bunch of warships and robotic drone aircraft.
[00:14:01.469 --> 00:14:03.272]  Better look out, my friends.
[00:14:03.733 --> 00:14:05.957]  Better look out, North Korea and China.
[00:14:06.077 --> 00:14:08.361]  And again, as I said, better look out, America.
[00:14:09.984 --> 00:14:12.206]  Leak of Japan nuclear plant kills four.
[00:14:12.246 --> 00:14:16.870]  A non-radioactive steam link killed four people and injured seven others Monday.
[00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.391]  And the worst ever accident.
[00:14:18.411 --> 00:14:19.352]  It's not the worst ever.
[00:14:19.392 --> 00:14:20.373]  A bunch of people died.
[00:14:20.393 --> 00:14:21.994]  How many years ago was that?
[00:14:22.014 --> 00:14:28.219]  Remember that big thing blew up and it was all radioactive and spilt out into the city streets and then it got shut up real quick?
[00:14:29.051 --> 00:14:30.833]  I need to do a Google search and find that.
[00:14:31.153 --> 00:14:37.880]  A non-radioactive steam link killed four people and injured seven others Monday in the worst ever accident, a Japanese nuclear power plant official said.
[00:14:38.241 --> 00:14:40.483]  One other worker was reportedly in critical condition.
[00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:44.247]  The cause was not clear, but no radiation escaped the plant.
[00:14:44.547 --> 00:14:45.528]  Oh, escaped the plant.
[00:14:45.548 --> 00:14:47.450]  See, another article says there's radiation in the plant.
[00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:48.932]  Let's see, this is the doublespeak.
[00:14:48.992 --> 00:14:50.093]  Oh, it didn't escape the plant.
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:57.884]  The cause is not clear, but no radiation escaped the plant, and there was no need to evacuate the area around the city of Mihama.
[00:14:58.445 --> 00:15:03.668]  About 200 miles west of Tokyo, officials said that Mihama's population is 11,500.
[00:15:04.228 --> 00:15:08.411]  And it said the four died of severe burns.
[00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:17.316]  It said the local government office, Japanese media reported that another worker was in critical condition and had suffered heart and lung failure.
[00:15:18.777 --> 00:15:18.877]  Okay.
[00:15:18.897 --> 00:15:19.217]  Okay.
[00:15:20.246 --> 00:15:22.528]  Very, very suspicious.
[00:15:22.888 --> 00:15:23.649]  What do you think of that?
[00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.213]  Alright, back to one of the most important stories.
[00:15:28.253 --> 00:15:32.776]  Let's detail this now, then we'll go to break and come back and take your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:15:32.797 --> 00:15:33.177]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:15:33.217 --> 00:15:34.918]  We'll get you up and on the air.
[00:15:45.319 --> 00:15:50.223]  Again, I like to post articles on my website and then put our own little headline on them.
[00:15:50.504 --> 00:15:51.584]  Our own little comment.
[00:15:52.225 --> 00:15:53.646]  Our own little editorializing.
[00:15:55.087 --> 00:15:56.549]  Satan to monitor Lucifer.
[00:15:57.384 --> 00:15:58.764]  Or Fox to Guard Hen House.
[00:15:59.405 --> 00:15:59.765]  U.N.
[00:15:59.985 --> 00:16:01.605]  body to monitor U.S.
[00:16:01.705 --> 00:16:02.266]  elections.
[00:16:02.866 --> 00:16:06.287]  And as I said, here's a perfect example of the controlled left-right paradigm.
[00:16:06.727 --> 00:16:11.589]  Everybody knows that our elections are a fraud, so they send in the United Nations to, quote, save us.
[00:16:11.989 --> 00:16:13.069]  This promotes the U.N.
[00:16:13.129 --> 00:16:18.491]  as a global government authority, and will give the phony conservatives something to act anti-U.N.
[00:16:18.531 --> 00:16:18.811]  about.
[00:16:19.931 --> 00:16:23.072]  But Bush has, of course, invited them on in here.
[00:16:23.132 --> 00:16:23.733]  The U.N.
[00:16:23.833 --> 00:16:24.313]  said when...
[00:16:25.663 --> 00:16:32.966]  A bunch of different members of the Congress, Democrats, requested that they come in and monitor our elections.
[00:16:33.026 --> 00:16:36.148]  The UN said, well, Bush has to invite us.
[00:16:36.188 --> 00:16:37.708]  The executive branch has to.
[00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:40.530]  And Bush said, oh yeah, come on in.
[00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:45.172]  But they can't get within 50 feet of the polling places.
[00:16:45.212 --> 00:16:46.652]  They can't look at the machinery.
[00:16:48.213 --> 00:16:50.294]  And of course, I'm sure they'll say, well, there was a few...
[00:16:51.448 --> 00:17:17.692]  Irregularities, but overall the government's doing a great job, and they'll say, see, we've been independently certified by the United Nations, who I would add goes into scores of third world countries, funds the government or the rebels, overthrows the government, and massacres people by the hundreds of thousands, in some cases the millions, and is a total mechanism for
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:24.362]  An appendage, a tool, a weapon, a battering ram of the New World Order.
[00:17:24.462 --> 00:17:28.383]  But here's CNN, an international team to monitor presidential elections.
[00:17:28.984 --> 00:17:34.625]  Observers will be part of OSCE's Human Rights Office, a team of international observers.
[00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:39.347]  We'll monitor the presidential election in November, according to the U.S.
[00:17:39.367 --> 00:17:42.548]  State Department, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
[00:17:43.815 --> 00:17:49.079]  A subdivision of the United Nations and the EU was invited to monitor the election by the State Department.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:54.644]  The observers will come from the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights.
[00:17:55.265 --> 00:17:58.127]  It will be the first time such a team has been present for a U.S.
[00:17:58.167 --> 00:17:59.268]  presidential election.
[00:17:59.688 --> 00:18:00.089]  The U.S.
[00:18:00.169 --> 00:18:08.796]  is obliged to invite us, as all OSCE countries should, spokeswoman Uder Gunderdatter said.
[00:18:09.236 --> 00:18:09.917]  It's not...
[00:18:10.589 --> 00:18:13.872]  Legally binding, but it's a political commitment.
[00:18:14.012 --> 00:18:18.036]  They signed a document ten years ago to ask OSCE to observe elections.
[00:18:18.476 --> 00:18:29.185]  Thirteen Democratic members of the House of Representatives, raising the specter of possible civil liberties violations that they said took place in Florida and elsewhere in the 2000 election, wrote to U.N.
[00:18:29.205 --> 00:18:32.468]  Secretary General Kofi Annan in July, asking him to send observers.
[00:18:34.625 --> 00:18:41.896]  After Annan rejected their request, saying the administration must make the application, the Democrats asked Secretary of State Colin Powell to do so.
[00:18:42.917 --> 00:18:49.988]  The issue was hotly debated in the House, and Republicans got an amendment to a foreign aid bill that barred federal funds from being used.
[00:18:50.652 --> 00:18:52.352]  For the United Nations to monitor U.S.
[00:18:52.432 --> 00:18:55.653]  elections, which again makes them look good and conservative, but then Bush brings them in.
[00:18:56.133 --> 00:19:12.037]  The Associated Press reported in a letter dated July 30th and released last week, Assistant Secretary of State Paul Kelly told the Democrats about the invitation to the OSCE without monitoring and mentioning the U.N.
[00:19:12.137 --> 00:19:12.457]  issue.
[00:19:13.411 --> 00:19:25.957]  I am pleased Secretary of State Colin Powell is committed, as I am, to a fair and democratic process to Democratic Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, who spearheaded the effort to get the UN observers.
[00:19:26.497 --> 00:19:35.801]  The presence of monitors will assure Americans that America cares about their votes, and it cares about its standing in the world, she said in the news release.
[00:19:36.802 --> 00:19:38.222]  Yeah, that's right, Democrat.
[00:19:39.043 --> 00:19:41.304]  Don't support Republican Rush Holt's bill.
[00:19:42.745 --> 00:19:50.748]  That would force a paper trail to have these machines print out a paper copy of the vote that will be held for recount.
[00:19:51.684 --> 00:19:53.004]  No, no, don't do anything real.
[00:19:53.044 --> 00:19:54.965]  Don't call for these machines to be removed.
[00:19:55.425 --> 00:19:57.446]  Have the UN come in and certify it.
[00:19:57.866 --> 00:19:59.746]  Lucifer overlooking Satan.
[00:20:00.146 --> 00:20:01.927]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:20:02.127 --> 00:20:07.868]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:20:08.129 --> 00:20:13.210]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:22.895]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:20:23.235 --> 00:20:28.177]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:20:28.497 --> 00:20:32.519]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:37.402]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:20:37.842 --> 00:20:43.827]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:20:44.087 --> 00:20:50.312]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[00:21:02.381 --> 00:21:06.683]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[00:21:07.084 --> 00:21:07.964]  It still is!
[00:21:08.584 --> 00:21:12.066]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[00:21:12.406 --> 00:21:14.187]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[00:21:14.768 --> 00:21:16.849]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[00:21:17.389 --> 00:21:19.390]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:27.435]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[00:21:27.815 --> 00:21:31.577]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.

[00:22:00.084 --> 00:22:00.605]  I think?
[00:22:14.844 --> 00:22:18.328]  Fragrance?
[00:22:18.848 --> 00:22:24.434]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:22:24.574 --> 00:22:29.259]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:22:29.479 --> 00:22:31.902]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[00:22:32.282 --> 00:22:35.703]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.

[00:24:05.902 --> 00:24:07.823]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:08.303 --> 00:24:11.124]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:12.745 --> 00:24:14.626]  Let's go straight to your calls.
[00:24:14.806 --> 00:24:19.208]  Carlos in California and Brad, Robert, Wolfgang, Paul and others.
[00:24:19.728 --> 00:24:20.869]  Carlos, you're on the air.
[00:24:20.969 --> 00:24:21.529]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:24:22.662 --> 00:24:34.228]  Yeah, Alex, you know, we need a 9-11 commission that will ask some real questions made up by some of the family members of the 9-11 victims.
[00:24:35.289 --> 00:24:49.917]  You know, all these Saudis that left during that gap in time where no planes were allowed to leave, one of the Saudis was a prince who owned some of the horses at Kentucky Derby.
[00:24:50.663 --> 00:24:56.629]  Now, this Saudi was identified by a top operative of the jihadis that was captured.
[00:24:57.209 --> 00:25:02.734]  He was identified as one of the jihadis' connections.
[00:25:04.015 --> 00:25:13.464]  And this person that identified him identified two other connections within the Saudi royal family, and all three died within the same week.
[00:25:14.265 --> 00:25:16.367]  I know, and let me add something to this.
[00:25:17.765 --> 00:25:20.907]  Again, the entire commission is in bed with the globalists.
[00:25:20.987 --> 00:25:24.169]  Some of them are actually in business with the Bin Ladens, like Chairman Keene.
[00:25:24.189 --> 00:25:27.992]  Remember, they tried to have Henry Kissinger as the head of it, if that gives you an idea, folks.
[00:25:28.612 --> 00:25:29.613]  But here's a key point.
[00:25:30.093 --> 00:25:33.936]  James Baker represents the Saudis against the 9-11 families.
[00:25:34.716 --> 00:25:38.438]  Now, again, that's the Bush administration for you.
[00:25:39.479 --> 00:25:43.722]  And, of course, his cousin, Kerry, is up to his eyeballs in Saudi money as well.
[00:25:45.962 --> 00:25:55.328]  Of course, and James Baker also had some financial connections with Carlisle, which is making lots of money off the war in Iraq.
[00:25:55.828 --> 00:26:08.457]  The bin Laden family has made off just the increase in their profits from the probably held Carlisle Group, which they're majority owners in, they have made at least $2 billion on the war alone.
[00:26:08.897 --> 00:26:10.758]  Wow, their son did a good job for them.
[00:26:10.778 --> 00:26:11.859]  He's been a good CIA boy.
[00:26:13.226 --> 00:26:36.660]  Well, you know, it's not enough to say about all the financial connections between our president, the Saudi royal family, Devin Lovins, and the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, a Saudi royal who owned the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, Bid Bin Mahfou, was identified as a, through a Senate investigation,
[00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:51.334]  Hey, whether it's Noriega or Bin Laden or Saddam, what did Eisenhower call Fidel Castro?
[00:26:51.374 --> 00:26:55.236]  He called him the Abraham Lincoln of Latin America.
[00:26:55.776 --> 00:26:57.457]  They put all these people in.
[00:26:57.577 --> 00:26:58.237]  It's staged.
[00:26:58.317 --> 00:26:59.037]  Thanks for the call.
[00:27:00.198 --> 00:27:03.139]  It's how they operate, and people just cannot figure that out.
[00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:04.759]  Brad in Colorado.
[00:27:04.799 --> 00:27:05.660]  Brad, you're on the air.
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:06.100]  Go ahead.
[00:27:09.838 --> 00:27:11.741]  Yes, Brad, you're there, my friend.
[00:27:14.043 --> 00:27:14.404]  Brad?
[00:27:16.206 --> 00:27:17.668]  Brad's phone's having a problem.
[00:27:18.048 --> 00:27:18.930]  We'll go back to him.
[00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:21.633]  Another caller, Robert in Colorado.
[00:27:21.673 --> 00:27:22.374]  Robert, go ahead.
[00:27:23.689 --> 00:27:24.630]  Alex, good morning.
[00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:25.410]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:26.131]  I appreciate your time.
[00:27:26.151 --> 00:27:26.491]  You bet.
[00:27:26.531 --> 00:27:26.931]  Thank you.
[00:27:27.272 --> 00:27:28.252]  Yeah, I've got three points.
[00:27:28.332 --> 00:27:31.174]  I may not have time for all three, but I'll try to get them real quick.
[00:27:31.515 --> 00:27:36.899]  First off, the first time I ever heard your voice was on Roundtable with George Murray back in April or May, I think.
[00:27:36.959 --> 00:27:37.819]  March, somewhere around there.
[00:27:37.859 --> 00:27:38.940]  Yeah, that was a good broadcast.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.160]  Yeah.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:45.224]  You and Steve Quayle and several other people, and I didn't know who you were back then, but you started talking about capitalism and 9-1-1 being orchestrated.
[00:27:45.245 --> 00:27:46.145]  I thought you were crazy.
[00:27:46.766 --> 00:27:50.188]  But then I went to your website and started doing some research, and I think I've got to agree now.
[00:27:50.248 --> 00:27:51.369]  There was something to that.
[00:27:51.409 --> 00:27:52.730]  I think our government was behind it, so...
[00:27:53.523 --> 00:27:54.203]  Shout out to you.
[00:27:54.243 --> 00:27:54.923]  Thanks for what you're doing.
[00:27:54.943 --> 00:27:55.644]  Keep up the good work.
[00:27:56.084 --> 00:27:56.804]  Well, thank you.
[00:27:57.144 --> 00:27:57.564]  No problem.
[00:27:57.604 --> 00:28:01.865]  I was listening to one of your compatriots a few weeks ago, Dan Monteith.
[00:28:02.405 --> 00:28:06.126]  He had a guy on his Radio Liberty show talking about Freemasons.
[00:28:07.146 --> 00:28:14.548]  And a caller called in talking about the Brown v. Topeka Board of Education 1954 ruling.
[00:28:15.168 --> 00:28:19.809]  And he mentioned that Earl Warren, who was Chief Justice at that time, and
[00:28:21.038 --> 00:28:28.048]  Thurgood Marshall were both Freemasons, and his point was that rather than the government really caring about equal opportunity for education,
[00:28:28.897 --> 00:28:34.799]  It was their way to insinuate themselves into the state education and then try to dumb down education.
[00:28:35.219 --> 00:28:37.180]  And I want to know what you're feeling on that.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.140]  Well, no, that's absolutely true.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:44.702]  And look, what happens is you've got real problems in society, real evils that have to be righted.
[00:28:45.282 --> 00:28:52.545]  The government always comes in with a solution that has nothing to do with fixing the problem and has everything to do with more control.
[00:28:53.625 --> 00:28:55.205]  And that's exactly what happened.
[00:28:55.325 --> 00:28:56.706]  It was all about federal control.
[00:28:57.361 --> 00:28:58.422]  Yeah, good point.
[00:28:59.623 --> 00:29:05.788]  And also, you may or may not know this, you probably didn't know it, yesterday was the 30th anniversary of Richard Nixon resigning back in the 70s.
[00:29:05.928 --> 00:29:06.028]  Yes.
[00:29:06.268 --> 00:29:08.130]  Do you have any thoughts or feelings about that?
[00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:09.391]  Think about that at all?
[00:29:10.225 --> 00:29:17.450]  Well, I mean, a lot of times they'll use a president to carry out their dirty work, then they'll hang them out to dry to make people think, oh, we've dealt with the corruption.
[00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:23.633]  And so these are kind of disposable minions, or disposable heroes, depending on how you look at them.
[00:29:24.194 --> 00:29:25.194]  And that's what they do.
[00:29:25.274 --> 00:29:31.058]  You know, higher-level crime syndicates always burn their minions to then cover their trails.
[00:29:31.979 --> 00:29:33.019]  Yeah, I hear you.
[00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:33.519]  One last thing.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.640]  I hear some music, though.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:35.201]  Are you good?
[00:29:35.441 --> 00:29:36.221]  No, go ahead and finish.
[00:29:36.701 --> 00:29:37.302]  Okay, um...
[00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:40.571]  You were talking about Todd Beaver and Lennepole the other week.
[00:29:40.611 --> 00:29:43.691]  I think you were saying that that was contrived, those phone calls weren't real.
[00:29:43.952 --> 00:29:44.492]  Did you say that?
[00:29:44.972 --> 00:29:45.492]  Uh, yes.
[00:29:46.212 --> 00:29:47.933]  Well, I just like Lisa to be around.
[00:29:47.953 --> 00:29:48.653]  Tell you what, stay there.
[00:29:50.293 --> 00:29:51.253]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.694 --> 00:29:53.294]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.214 --> 00:29:56.875]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.158 --> 00:30:02.179]  It's finally here.
[00:30:02.299 --> 00:30:03.300]  Spring has arrived.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.443]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:30:06.643 --> 00:30:10.106]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:30:10.326 --> 00:30:19.514]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the Ark Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection with Ark's Heirloom.
[00:30:19.794 --> 00:30:22.457]  You can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[00:30:22.677 --> 00:30:27.722]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[00:30:27.982 --> 00:30:32.486]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[00:30:32.686 --> 00:30:36.750]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:44.017]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[00:30:44.277 --> 00:30:45.518]  Save money, eat healthy.
[00:30:45.778 --> 00:30:49.722]  Grow your own delicious secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[00:30:49.922 --> 00:30:51.624]  Call the Ark Institute toll free at 800-255-1912.

[00:31:00.822 --> 00:31:02.443]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:02.583 --> 00:31:06.666]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:06.826 --> 00:31:09.707]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:09.787 --> 00:31:16.511]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:16.692 --> 00:31:19.693]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:31:19.894 --> 00:31:22.295]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:31:22.415 --> 00:31:30.580]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as after
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:31.200]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:31.521]  That's 888-803-4438.

[00:32:00.169 --> 00:32:05.152]  Imagine a weight loss program that burns off calories by simply eating certain everyday foods.
[00:32:05.633 --> 00:32:08.014]  With a reverse calorie diet, it's possible.
[00:32:08.554 --> 00:32:14.298]  Every time you eat food, various organs such as your liver, spleen, and stomach have to work to complete digestion.
[00:32:14.718 --> 00:32:21.003]  For example, an ordinary piece of cake that has 300 calories may require only 25 calories to complete digestion.
[00:32:21.403 --> 00:32:29.308]  But a reverse calorie food that contains 50 calories may require 100 calories to complete digestion, actually removing fat from your body.
[00:32:29.848 --> 00:32:30.749]  It's guaranteed.
[00:32:30.769 --> 00:32:31.129]  Call 1-800-647-3200.
[00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:31.529]  That's 1-800-647-3200.
[00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:14.191]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:33:14.231 --> 00:33:15.291]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:33:15.531 --> 00:33:26.573]  I'm sure you've heard the news that an American computer expert, but he didn't really use computers to get the job done, duped the U.S.
[00:33:26.633 --> 00:33:27.073]  government.
[00:33:27.113 --> 00:33:31.074]  Now the FBI is probing the hoax video of Iraq beheading
[00:33:32.345 --> 00:33:35.026]  And it was all over the news for two days this weekend.
[00:33:35.086 --> 00:33:38.728]  Oh my gosh, look at the new video of him cutting an American's head off.
[00:33:40.008 --> 00:33:48.932]  And I can't really do this justice because the Nicholas Berg video has now over a hundred anomalies that we've seen.
[00:33:50.312 --> 00:33:53.694]  I mean, two hijackers have got the cubs to his computers.
[00:33:53.734 --> 00:33:55.234]  He's investigated by the FBI.
[00:33:55.314 --> 00:34:01.417]  He quits an Ivy League school with an almost perfect grade point average to go travel the world helping the poor and disadvantaged.
[00:34:01.477 --> 00:34:01.537]  He
[00:34:02.242 --> 00:34:04.063]  He works at Abu Ghraib prison.
[00:34:04.103 --> 00:34:06.264]  He's held by the FBI for 13 days.
[00:34:06.664 --> 00:34:07.965]  Released into L.C.I.A.
[00:34:08.005 --> 00:34:08.605]  his hands.
[00:34:09.125 --> 00:34:10.386]  Gets his head cut off.
[00:34:10.706 --> 00:34:15.688]  Then forensic heads of universities look at it and say that's not really somebody getting their head cut off.
[00:34:16.008 --> 00:34:16.849]  The body would jerk.
[00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:17.769]  Blood would spray.
[00:34:18.289 --> 00:34:24.052]  Then video experts look at it and say the video's been doctored and the audio's been manipulated.
[00:34:24.312 --> 00:34:28.574]  We have a government who's been caught planning fake letters from troops with false signatures.
[00:34:30.281 --> 00:34:44.076]  In newspapers coast to coast that produces fake Niger weapons documents, that uses 12-year-old graduate student papers as, quote, the latest intel, that uses four-year intel to claim that we're about to be under impending attack.
[00:34:45.037 --> 00:34:51.745]  I could go on for hours with where they ordered the FBI and CIA to, quote, issue fake terror alerts.
[00:34:52.765 --> 00:35:04.511]  And so then when we have a government that says, oh, we got a couple phone calls from people on board the hijacked aircraft that say that, oh my gosh, we've been hijacked, honey.
[00:35:05.012 --> 00:35:07.453]  My point is that it's very easy to fake those.
[00:35:09.014 --> 00:35:13.756]  And you cannot trust... Number one, what cell phone ever worked from a plane?
[00:35:14.056 --> 00:35:15.137]  Their own private cell phones.
[00:35:15.157 --> 00:35:15.917]  Frankly, I've tried it.
[00:35:16.318 --> 00:35:17.118]  I know people who've tried it.
[00:35:17.678 --> 00:35:18.879]  I mean, this stuff doesn't even work.
[00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:20.230]  I don't know.
[00:35:42.148 --> 00:35:44.489]  My point is, I don't believe their official story.
[00:35:44.769 --> 00:35:53.591]  I mean, you have them claiming that all the five air traffic control tower tapes, we've got air traffic controllers on this show, by the way, all those malfunctioned.
[00:35:53.611 --> 00:35:55.092]  Or then all of them were erased.
[00:35:55.352 --> 00:35:59.753]  Then they release clips of the air traffic control towers they claim were erased.
[00:36:01.428 --> 00:36:05.050]  I mean, they killed the same people three, four, five times, the same terrorists.
[00:36:05.331 --> 00:36:19.520]  It's just, it's sloppily done theater, but they know that 90% of high school graduates in major polls don't know who the vice president is, don't know how many continents there are, can't find Iraq on a map, on a globe.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:25.483]  So they know that we're dumbed down or not focused on real issues, so they just get away with all this.
[00:36:25.603 --> 00:36:26.504]  I don't believe a word of it.
[00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:33.513]  But we're about to go to Justin Rude, who writes for Congressional Quarterly Homeland Security.
[00:36:34.694 --> 00:36:38.176]  He writes for Salon, I mean, you name it.
[00:36:38.756 --> 00:36:48.361]  And he found some interesting info about the NORTHCOM, our new military command that runs our lives, basically, if we're under attack, coming out and saying that
[00:36:49.458 --> 00:36:56.760]  We need to hire some people for basically the Pentagon's Office of Strategic Influence, which they admitted two years ago was going to plant fake news stories.
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:01.381]  But then they claimed that they were withdrawing that program, so their first big lie.
[00:37:01.801 --> 00:37:12.584]  But briefly, and I appreciate our guest holding, I wanted to answer your question, Brad in Colorado, about why I think those tapes from the people that were on the hijacked planes are fake.
[00:37:13.284 --> 00:37:14.946]  And I gave you some background of that.
[00:37:15.346 --> 00:37:20.151]  Once you've lied to me hundreds of times and been caught manufacturing evidence, I don't believe you.
[00:37:20.852 --> 00:37:22.033]  So that's why I say that.
[00:37:22.113 --> 00:37:24.995]  But real quick, Brad, does that answer your question?
[00:37:25.536 --> 00:37:26.116]  That's Robert.
[00:37:26.277 --> 00:37:27.298]  And yeah, it kind of does.
[00:37:27.358 --> 00:37:28.038]  One last thing.
[00:37:28.559 --> 00:37:29.500]  What about Lisa Beamer?
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.202]  Do you think she was a part of that or did she just believe that was really her husband?
[00:37:32.242 --> 00:37:32.903]  What about who?
[00:37:33.423 --> 00:37:34.084]  Lisa Beamer?
[00:37:34.952 --> 00:37:35.972]  Remember Todd Beamer's wife?
[00:37:36.052 --> 00:37:37.453]  I thought they had a conversation.
[00:37:37.593 --> 00:37:38.073]  Well, no, sir.
[00:37:38.153 --> 00:37:44.054]  It's, again, she said that she just got a call and he real quick said something and it disconnected.
[00:37:44.474 --> 00:37:44.954]  Oh, I see.
[00:37:45.295 --> 00:37:45.575]  Okay.
[00:37:46.215 --> 00:37:47.555]  Hey, I appreciate your call.
[00:37:47.735 --> 00:37:48.955]  I appreciate your call, Robert.
[00:37:49.216 --> 00:37:53.937]  Look, all I know is they called public officials and told them not to fly to New York.
[00:37:55.177 --> 00:37:59.138]  Mayors, Joint Chiefs of Staff, that's San Francisco Chronicle Newsweek.
[00:38:00.171 --> 00:38:03.054]  All I know is there was insider trading that led back to the CIA.
[00:38:03.235 --> 00:38:07.060]  All I know is hijackers went around creating this ledger, this history.
[00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:10.544]  They have their houses, their cars, their credit cards paid for by the U.S.
[00:38:10.564 --> 00:38:10.905]  government.
[00:38:11.345 --> 00:38:14.089]  All I know is PNAC calls for helpful terror attacks.
[00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:16.591]  To get the people behind this war.
[00:38:16.611 --> 00:38:22.174]  All right, before our guest hangs up on us, I don't normally do that, and I apologize, let's go to Justin Rude.
[00:38:22.734 --> 00:38:26.496]  And Justin has written several interesting articles in the last week.
[00:38:26.656 --> 00:38:28.357]  One of them is Protection or Paranoia?
[00:38:28.717 --> 00:38:34.800]  Why is the Secret Service treating harmless professors and pacifist homeless advocates like they're members of Al-Qaeda?
[00:38:35.413 --> 00:38:36.013]  Good to be here, sir.
[00:39:01.485 --> 00:39:02.066]  You bet.
[00:39:02.106 --> 00:39:11.833]  Tell us about where we can read your fine research and some of the places that carry your columns, and then let's get into this latest Pentagon Office of Strategic Influence report.
[00:39:12.233 --> 00:39:12.454]  Sure.
[00:39:12.474 --> 00:39:20.400]  Well, I write for a publication called Congressional Quarterly's Homeland Security, which is a subscription-based site that's kind of inside the Beltway-type publication.
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:26.905]  I also write for Salon.com, but I post most of what I do to a site called Page15.com, Page15.com.
[00:39:31.946 --> 00:39:34.287]  Let's get into this article from last week.
[00:39:35.347 --> 00:39:48.173]  You found something interesting with Northcom advertising for high-level people with security clearances for deception operations was, I believe, one of the quotes.
[00:39:48.614 --> 00:39:57.878]  Yeah, I was just going through some websites for some military contractors and came across this job posting for an influence operations specialist.
[00:39:58.522 --> 00:40:05.205]  That was supposed to interface with NORTHCOM, with the military's northern command that controls the continental U.S.
[00:40:06.425 --> 00:40:12.168]  And that seemed a little strange to me, because they're not supposed to be doing influence operations in the continental United States.
[00:40:13.889 --> 00:40:26.794]  So I started poking around and found out that it was part of an Air Force contract, but it made this reference to influence operations at NORTHCOM and defined them as including psychological operations and deception plans
[00:40:30.365 --> 00:40:36.708]  So I called NORTHCOM to try to find out what the story was, and they didn't have a real good answer.
[00:40:37.008 --> 00:40:40.970]  They insisted, of course, it wasn't happening, but they did say that they had psyops.
[00:40:41.951 --> 00:40:46.513]  There are psychological operations which encompasses various forms of propaganda, like you had mentioned.
[00:40:47.354 --> 00:40:55.378]  And it wasn't real clear, not to get too technical into the whole world of the way the Pentagon is organized, but it's not real clear why that's at NORTHCOM.
[00:40:56.693 --> 00:40:59.416]  And maybe you've got listeners who can enlighten.
[00:40:59.637 --> 00:41:02.420]  Well, I can enlighten you myself, and I'm sure our listeners can.
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:05.964]  We're actually on the radio in Colorado Springs.
[00:41:06.405 --> 00:41:07.746]  Oh, excellent!
[00:41:07.866 --> 00:41:09.488]  Yeah, one of our affiliates is...
[00:41:10.632 --> 00:41:14.093]  Part of the Colorado Radio Network is one of our affiliates there.
[00:41:14.113 --> 00:41:19.355]  Well, if there's anybody there who can clue me in, please, you can send me an email to justin at page 15 dot com.
[00:41:19.795 --> 00:41:22.216]  justin at page 15 dot com.
[00:41:22.236 --> 00:41:28.238]  Well, did you see General Eberhardt, the head of NORTHCOM, late last year in the LA Times?
[00:41:29.439 --> 00:41:36.223]  Well, his quote was, the military's not watching Americans, the Pentagon is.
[00:41:36.243 --> 00:41:39.645]  So that's like saying, Satan isn't the devil, Lucifer is.
[00:41:39.665 --> 00:41:44.549]  I mean, to use that analogy again, or to say, you know, my name's not Alex, it's Jones.
[00:41:45.309 --> 00:41:47.411]  So it's just a semantical manipulation.
[00:41:47.671 --> 00:41:49.952]  But he goes on to say we need troops on the streets.
[00:41:49.992 --> 00:41:53.095]  And we've had the head of Homeland Security say this.
[00:41:53.115 --> 00:41:58.258]  I've interviewed troops who were in plain clothes in 1989 kicking down gun dealers' doors.
[00:41:58.318 --> 00:41:59.219]  Right, right.
[00:41:59.499 --> 00:42:03.902]  I've got video of military checkpoints all over the country years before 9-11.
[00:42:04.442 --> 00:42:06.344]  So this is a covert program.
[00:42:06.364 --> 00:42:12.648]  But this latest thing, this directly ties into the Pentagon Office of Strategic Information of influence.
[00:42:12.708 --> 00:42:13.589]  You're aware of that.
[00:42:13.649 --> 00:42:14.189]  Tell us about it.
[00:42:14.389 --> 00:42:27.679]  Well, the interesting thing is that when the idea for this Office of Strategic Influence, this OSI office, was floating around a couple years ago, the big news was that they were talking about doing propaganda efforts on friendly countries.
[00:42:27.719 --> 00:42:36.205]  And apparently we do do propaganda efforts against enemy countries, but the idea that we'd be doing it against countries like England and Australia...
[00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:39.572]  Or journalists working there was controversial.
[00:42:39.992 --> 00:42:41.133]  But again, here's the spin.
[00:42:41.153 --> 00:42:42.114]  You're a journalist.
[00:42:42.974 --> 00:42:45.056]  This is a small world now.
[00:42:45.516 --> 00:42:51.880]  What is in England or the Sydney Morning Herald or Der Spiegel instantly is picked up by our news because it's highly respected.
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:55.042]  Journalistic standards, frankly, are much higher on average over there.
[00:42:55.723 --> 00:42:59.746]  And so to do a PSYOP on England is to do a PSYOP on us.
[00:42:59.906 --> 00:43:00.606]  Well, exactly.
[00:43:00.646 --> 00:43:02.988]  It's interesting that's an argument because
[00:43:03.959 --> 00:43:04.840]  I think both ways.
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:09.504]  That's one argument, you know, that says, well, there are no really borders when it comes to information anymore.
[00:43:09.984 --> 00:43:21.753]  And certainly, as I've been doing some of my background reading and talking with experts on PSYOPs, they say that's exactly why we have to have operations anywhere there's information, because the information generated in the U.S.
[00:43:21.813 --> 00:43:22.914]  also goes off to enemies.
[00:43:23.715 --> 00:43:23.855]  So...
[00:43:26.403 --> 00:43:37.850]  Well, this is like sliding down a razor blade into a pool of alcohol for the country because, I mean, we know the government's been manipulating the media for at least 40, 50 years.
[00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:40.512]  There were congressional church hearings.
[00:43:41.513 --> 00:43:45.595]  The Bluebird, Mockingbird, excuse me, I was thinking of Bluebeam.
[00:43:46.216 --> 00:43:47.016]  I crossed the two.
[00:43:47.496 --> 00:43:48.697]  Operation Mockingbird.
[00:43:49.097 --> 00:43:54.361]  We know a lot of key people in the media also pulled down a couple hundred G's.
[00:43:55.161 --> 00:43:55.742]  Right.
[00:43:55.762 --> 00:43:59.165]  Well, this is the interesting thing, and I mentioned this in the article.
[00:43:59.205 --> 00:44:02.108]  They came out and said they weren't going to do it.
[00:44:02.148 --> 00:44:05.352]  And then, last October, they slipped about $300,000, which really is not a whole lot of money by military standards.
[00:44:18.748 --> 00:44:23.252]  To a Pentagon contractor, SAIC, to develop a strategic influence plan.
[00:44:23.512 --> 00:44:27.956]  And we didn't really get a whole lot of information about that other than that's what the New York Times reported.
[00:44:28.256 --> 00:44:29.717]  And then we didn't hear anything else about it.
[00:44:30.538 --> 00:44:37.363]  And then this job description pops up, and lo and behold, SAIC is one of the ones bidding for the contract that includes this position.
[00:44:39.485 --> 00:44:43.048]  And SAIC, I believe they hold staffing contracts that
[00:44:43.933 --> 00:44:45.755]  Yeah, they're one of those filter points.
[00:44:45.935 --> 00:44:46.596]  But, I mean, look.
[00:45:03.644 --> 00:45:04.264]  We know.
[00:45:04.344 --> 00:45:07.706]  There's evidence everywhere that they're doing this big time.
[00:45:07.726 --> 00:45:11.768]  I mean, I'm sure you heard about the fake letters from troops with fake signatures.
[00:45:12.108 --> 00:45:13.068]  Oh, I love the war.
[00:45:13.088 --> 00:45:14.289]  The Iraqis love us.
[00:45:14.549 --> 00:45:14.789]  Right.
[00:45:15.529 --> 00:45:17.150]  I mean, that's a great example right there.
[00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:18.711]  Yeah.
[00:45:18.911 --> 00:45:19.511]  Yeah, it is.
[00:45:19.751 --> 00:45:19.991]  It is.
[00:45:20.931 --> 00:45:23.813]  It's an interesting one, to be sure.
[00:45:24.753 --> 00:45:31.376]  I mean, the problem that you get into here, and I think largely looked at it from the perspective of an American citizen or especially a journalist,
[00:45:32.711 --> 00:45:53.886]  The issue of where that comes from isn't quite as important, but in terms of figuring out what's going on and why, and what laws are being broken, as they are, the question is, is that something that happened to occur to a colonel in the field and so ordered it to be done, or is this something that was cooked up at some sort of PSYOP operation and run that way?
[00:45:55.367 --> 00:45:59.209]  Well, I think it's pretty obvious, especially when you look at the pattern.
[00:45:59.590 --> 00:45:59.730]  But
[00:46:00.916 --> 00:46:05.178]  So what do we know that the Pentagon Office of Strategic Influence, what are they up to right now?
[00:46:05.218 --> 00:46:07.419]  I mean, are they still claiming that they don't exist?
[00:46:07.739 --> 00:46:08.219]  We don't know.
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:10.880]  You know, the Pentagon never really made it clear.
[00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:22.145]  I think Rumsfeld came out and made a statement or two soon after that came out that they were no longer going to do that and they wouldn't be engaged in that sort of behavior.
[00:46:22.265 --> 00:46:24.887]  But since then it's been quiet.
[00:46:24.947 --> 00:46:25.367]  It's not...
[00:46:26.246 --> 00:46:31.069]  You know, they don't put the stuff up on billboards anymore, so it's not always easy to know what's going on.
[00:46:31.509 --> 00:46:53.100]  An interesting note is that the Office of Strategic Influence, that was under Doug Fite, who is, I'm sure the name is all too familiar to you, but has been involved in the alternative intelligence operations at the Pentagon and trying to come up with good, quote-unquote, intelligence regarding the war in Iraq and other issues.
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:47:06.890]  Yeah, so we've got the same players over and over again, the same civilian contractors, the same operations popping up in a redundant fashion.
[00:47:08.692 --> 00:47:11.634]  When you talk to NORTHCOM, though, at first they tried to deny this.
[00:47:11.694 --> 00:47:13.195]  That's suspicious right there.
[00:47:13.235 --> 00:47:14.917]  Well, at first they wouldn't say anything about it.
[00:47:15.495 --> 00:47:16.956]  Which is more suspicious than a denial.
[00:47:17.796 --> 00:47:21.298]  But they just said, you're talking about operational things and we can't comment on that.
[00:47:21.358 --> 00:47:29.103]  And I said, well, you know, we're talking about illegal things because you're not allowed to be doing influence operations, you know, psyops within the U.S.
[00:47:29.363 --> 00:47:30.324]  So can you tell me?
[00:47:30.944 --> 00:47:33.886]  And I went around and around with the spokesman there.
[00:47:33.906 --> 00:47:37.808]  I said, can you just say we aren't doing psyops in the United States?
[00:47:38.789 --> 00:47:39.249]  And he wouldn't.
[00:47:40.841 --> 00:47:45.504]  And then he asked to see the documents that I was referring to that this was coming from.
[00:47:45.584 --> 00:48:01.097]  So I sent him the documents, and it wasn't until three or four days later, and they apparently had to do a bunch of running around on their end to figure out what to say and what to tell me, that they came out and said that I know that they didn't do this, that it was illegal, it was obviously illegal, and that it wasn't anything that they'd do.
[00:48:01.837 --> 00:48:07.482]  And then when I would say, well, point blank, do you have psychological operations being run out of NORTHCOM?
[00:48:08.709 --> 00:48:10.230]  When I asked him directly, he would say no.
[00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:15.372]  But then I would say, is there any coordination between PSYOPs and your public affairs?
[00:48:15.392 --> 00:48:30.777]  Because even if they aren't doing direct PSYOPs, even if PSYOPs isn't directly involved in running propaganda campaigns, the idea that they would coordinate messages with public affairs is somewhat troubling for a person in my position who spends all day talking to public affairs people.
[00:48:31.257 --> 00:48:32.097]  Exactly.
[00:48:32.157 --> 00:48:36.159]  But Justin Rood, again from Salon Magazine,
[00:48:38.129 --> 00:48:51.603]  Look, if we have CENTCOM running psychological operations and we have SOUTHCOM doing it and we have the other geographical groups doing this,
[00:48:52.367 --> 00:48:55.588]  And then they set one up for America, it's going to run under the same model.
[00:48:55.628 --> 00:48:57.609]  I mean, that's just common sense.
[00:48:58.449 --> 00:48:59.429]  That is common sense.
[00:48:59.489 --> 00:49:04.431]  And again, I mean, there's a small gap between common sense and known fact.
[00:49:04.451 --> 00:49:06.512]  I haven't been able to establish that.
[00:49:06.912 --> 00:49:08.512]  But, I mean, you're absolutely right.
[00:49:08.552 --> 00:49:15.775]  And I think that you're tapping into another kind of function here that you get a lot inside the Beltway, which is that if somebody else has it, I want it too.
[00:49:17.287 --> 00:49:27.293]  You know, and if somebody, you know, has been working over at South Com, who's over at North Com, or, you know, you find out that one place just opened up their own ice cream parlor, you want to get an ice cream parlor at North Com too, you know?
[00:49:27.753 --> 00:49:34.557]  So it's, there's that kind of bureaucratic wrangling, which unfortunately doesn't have as much to do with looking at constitutional responsibilities.
[00:49:34.597 --> 00:49:37.199]  Well, you study this in depth.
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:42.802]  You write a scholarly report that's read by members of Congress and others, and
[00:49:46.404 --> 00:49:50.829]  I mean, this is just amazing to have this happening here.
[00:49:51.670 --> 00:50:00.760]  And I'm sure you've got comments about this new domestic security czar that they're now talking about being independent from Congress and maybe even the President.
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:01.561]  That is scary.
[00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:18.879]  Yeah, and it's actually, it's really interesting because, you know, as much as there are strange things going on out there, Alex, as much as you've got kind of, you know, what look like sort of, you know, illegal operations and whatnot and everything else, there's a lot of really good people who are trying to do a lot of really good things in the CIA and the FBI and elsewhere.
[00:50:19.539 --> 00:50:30.725]  And when I talk to people, senior officials and former senior officials from the CIA, from the FBI and other intelligence organizations, they all say, you know, this is a horrible idea.
[00:50:32.421 --> 00:50:43.469]  Especially because the issue of having domestic intelligence being under the White House and not beholden to other areas is a particularly dangerous one, and one they've spent a lot of their lives trying to protect.
[00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:47.712]  Well, it's a hallmark of grade-A tyranny.
[00:50:48.253 --> 00:50:49.954]  Mr. Rood, please stay with us.
[00:50:50.614 --> 00:50:52.256]  I appreciate you joining us.
[00:50:52.276 --> 00:50:54.998]  We'll come back and talk about that and your article also.
[00:50:55.398 --> 00:50:57.620]  Protection or paranoia, it's excellent.
[00:50:57.660 --> 00:50:58.140]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:04.502]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:04.702 --> 00:51:09.124]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:09.264 --> 00:51:13.625]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:13.665 --> 00:51:15.026]  The New World Order.
[00:51:15.786 --> 00:51:16.727]  Panamers.
[00:51:16.807 --> 00:51:21.032]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:21.092 --> 00:51:28.040]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:30.183]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:30.543 --> 00:51:40.967]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:41.147 --> 00:51:46.550]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:52:33.401 --> 00:52:42.269]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:45.851]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[00:54:01.147 --> 00:54:07.208]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:08.809 --> 00:54:25.713]  We're about to go back to Justin Rood and get into some of the other things that are happening with our new super mega domestic KGB GRU Stasi Gestapo arm that'll coordinate all the nice men in black ski masks and black helmets that are searching you and your family while leaving the border wide open.
[00:54:26.949 --> 00:54:47.815]  But before we go back to Mr. Rude here in just a moment, I want to encourage all of you to visit prisonplanet.com and infowars.com as well as prisonplanet.tv and visit our secure online safe shopping cart and look at all the books and videos and books on tape and bumper stickers and infowars.com t-shirts and...
[00:54:49.096 --> 00:54:52.277]  All of it is about spreading the word, educating the people.
[00:54:52.337 --> 00:54:53.538]  I've made two films about 9-11.
[00:54:53.678 --> 00:55:04.122]  I've made three films about the militarization of police, the FEMA centers, the internal security forces, Police State 1, Police State 2, Police State 3.
[00:55:05.082 --> 00:55:07.483]  Police State 3 Total Enslavement is one of my newest films.
[00:55:07.963 --> 00:55:10.004]  It's two hours, 44 minutes long.
[00:55:10.024 --> 00:55:11.585]  You want to be an expert on this stuff.
[00:55:12.025 --> 00:55:14.066]  All the facts, all the documents in your face.
[00:55:14.822 --> 00:55:15.422]  You need to get them.
[00:55:37.992 --> 00:55:42.815]  888-253-3139 That's 888-253-3139 Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:55:43.236 --> 00:55:44.116]  Please take action.
[00:55:58.172 --> 00:56:01.794]  We're going to have Mr. Rude with us about 20 minutes into the next hour.
[00:56:01.834 --> 00:56:03.795]  We're going to get into protection or paranoia.
[00:56:04.175 --> 00:56:09.558]  Why is the Secret Service treating harmless professors and pacifist homeless advocates like they're members of Al-Qaeda?
[00:56:09.959 --> 00:56:10.939]  They're doing that to everybody.
[00:56:11.039 --> 00:56:18.763]  Pot dealers, county commissioners that take $4,000 to give somebody more parking spaces for their shopping center or topless bar.
[00:56:19.704 --> 00:56:20.444]  Very serious.
[00:56:20.464 --> 00:56:21.405]  We're going to talk about that.
[00:56:21.745 --> 00:56:25.107]  But the last few minutes we've got left here in this hour, Justin...
[00:56:25.607 --> 00:56:33.773]  Can you get into this new mega, super agency that's going to oversee all the other agencies and be outside Congress's purview?
[00:56:34.954 --> 00:56:47.203]  Yeah, well, the only thing that makes it difficult to talk about is that we don't really know what form it's going to take, but they've been talking about creating this National Counterterrorism Center that came out of the 9-11 Commission report.
[00:56:49.524 --> 00:56:52.546]  The scariest thing about it is they have a horrible cold.
[00:56:54.265 --> 00:56:59.650]  They want to combine domestic intelligence and foreign intelligence control in the same office.
[00:57:01.051 --> 00:57:10.380]  And that raises some important concerns because, as one former FBI guy said, and as a former CIA guy said, you don't want the CIA doing in the U.S.
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:11.581]  what the FBI does in the U.S.
[00:57:11.641 --> 00:57:12.442]  I mean, you don't want the...
[00:57:13.041 --> 00:57:17.002]  Well, I agree with you, but also this tactic of creating a new agency that then is separate from Congress...
[00:57:42.334 --> 00:57:44.755]  It will then command and control the other agencies.
[00:57:44.795 --> 00:57:47.817]  The 9-11 Commission has said what they want.
[00:57:47.897 --> 00:57:49.417]  Congress is saying what they want.
[00:57:50.158 --> 00:57:59.222]  And it's a pretty scary thing because, frankly, the government can't find enough, in my opinion, crooks to carry out what they want to do here in this country.
[00:57:59.562 --> 00:58:07.386]  And so they're going to create their own groups, staff it with their own minions, their own corporate private enforcers in many cases, these mercs, and then...
[00:58:08.539 --> 00:58:13.324]  This is a danger to our country itself and the continuity of our government.
[00:58:13.364 --> 00:58:17.908]  This just smacks of internal security force of the furor.
[00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:23.393]  There are, I think, concerns.
[00:58:24.694 --> 00:58:25.575]  I think that's well said.
[00:58:25.775 --> 00:58:26.396]  Quick question.
[00:58:28.185 --> 00:58:31.828]  What percentage of FBI and CIA you talk to, they're in the beltway, are against this?
[00:58:32.728 --> 00:58:33.249]  80%, 50%, what?
[00:58:34.149 --> 00:58:36.771]  I would say there's 100% who are against it.
[00:58:36.851 --> 00:58:41.694]  I'd say half of them are against it because they want the FBI to retain the powers the FBI always had and the CIA.
[00:58:42.155 --> 00:58:46.878]  And the other half have serious constitutional concerns about what would happen if we had an office like this.
[00:58:46.978 --> 00:58:49.079]  But the mainstream media says everyone loves it.
[00:58:49.099 --> 00:58:49.539]  We'll be back.
[00:58:49.559 --> 00:58:50.100]  We'll be back.
[00:58:57.623 --> 00:58:58.263]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.924 --> 00:58:59.984]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.684 --> 00:59:01.785]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.445 --> 00:59:03.266]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.026 --> 00:59:04.906]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.926 --> 00:59:09.428]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.788 --> 00:59:13.910]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.090 --> 00:59:16.932]  All right, my friends.
[00:59:16.972 --> 00:59:19.073]  Second hour of this Monday.
[00:59:20.913 --> 00:59:23.534]  Now the night of August 2004 edition.
[00:59:26.129 --> 00:59:27.690]  We're talking to Justin Rude.
[00:59:28.191 --> 00:59:35.397]  He writes for Congressional Quarterly Homeland Security, a scholarly publication read by members of Congress and the government in D.C.
[00:59:36.298 --> 00:59:40.061]  His columns are picked up by major publications like Salon.com and many others.
[00:59:41.022 --> 00:59:42.323]  Last hour, we talked about...
[00:59:43.281 --> 01:00:00.672]  A hiring ad he found, put up by Northcom, our military owners, basically, there in Colorado Springs, wanting to hire disinformation, deception officers to plant fake news stories here in the U.S.
[01:00:00.712 --> 01:00:01.273]  and abroad.
[01:00:02.205 --> 01:00:20.510]  And then we got into the new domestic super-intelligence czar that will be outside Congress' purview, and he said that 100% of FBI and CIA people he talks to are against this, and half of them because they want the FBI to keep its power, and the other half, in his words, because they think it's unconstitutional and dangerous.
[01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:24.611]  Folks, this is the Gestapo, the Emperor's Praetorian Guard.
[01:00:25.312 --> 01:00:27.092]  Very, very serious.
[01:00:27.152 --> 01:00:29.973]  And the committee that Bush appointed...
[01:00:30.603 --> 01:00:34.265]  Most of them business partners with him called for this, and it's very, very scary.
[01:00:34.485 --> 01:00:36.206]  And notice, Kerry's calling for it, too.
[01:00:36.826 --> 01:00:38.687]  Big government control wants this.
[01:00:39.888 --> 01:00:45.711]  So we're continuing with the discussion of this, and again, we're on the radio in the Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[01:00:46.751 --> 01:00:47.992]  We're on the American Freedom Network.
[01:00:48.012 --> 01:00:49.393]  We're also on the Colorado Radio Network.
[01:00:49.413 --> 01:00:54.035]  So we're on all over Colorado, and this is where it's all based.
[01:00:54.694 --> 01:00:56.475]  And it's very, very dangerous.
[01:00:57.156 --> 01:01:01.799]  Spending a few more minutes on why these CIA and NFL people you talk to are against this, Mr. Rood.
[01:01:01.819 --> 01:01:06.002]  Then I'm going to come back and get into your other article on Salon Protection or Paranoia.
[01:01:06.483 --> 01:01:23.455]  But continuing, when you talk to these officers in D.C., and you talk about this new domestic control arm, and when you talk about the Pentagon office of strategic influence that admits they lie to us and plant stories, when you talk to them, what do they say about this, that 50% that are against this for constitutional reasons?
[01:01:26.781 --> 01:01:27.441]  Justin, are you there?
[01:01:29.342 --> 01:01:30.623]  We just had Justin on with us.
[01:01:30.683 --> 01:01:32.363]  Is he there now, George?
[01:01:33.204 --> 01:01:34.564]  Do we have him, guys?
[01:01:35.665 --> 01:01:41.607]  Okay, we're doing something with the phone line system right now, and we'll never have this happen before.
[01:01:41.647 --> 01:01:44.169]  We'll get to Mr. Rood here in a second.
[01:01:44.189 --> 01:01:47.530]  Hey, guys, do we know what's going on with Mr. Rood?
[01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:49.271]  Okay, we don't.
[01:01:49.611 --> 01:01:51.492]  Mr. Rood, I'm going to have to ask you to hold a few minutes.
[01:01:51.532 --> 01:01:52.192]  I apologize.
[01:01:52.212 --> 01:01:53.352]  This never happens, and we'll...
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:02:02.126]  We'll find out exactly what in the world is going on and talk to you here in just a few minutes.
[01:02:02.146 --> 01:02:04.729]  We're about to break anyways, and we'll get into this.
[01:02:05.469 --> 01:02:07.611]  Also, listeners, we're going to take your calls.
[01:02:07.631 --> 01:02:10.013]  You can be on with us for another segment where we get into these two subjects.
[01:02:10.834 --> 01:02:13.396]  Then we'll get into UN body to monitor U.S.
[01:02:13.556 --> 01:02:14.197]  elections.
[01:02:15.263 --> 01:02:16.524]  Then, of course, a leak in Japan.
[01:02:16.544 --> 01:02:19.847]  Nuclear plant kills four, injures a bunch of other people, unfortunately.
[01:02:20.507 --> 01:02:22.128]  Iraqi car bomb kills seven.
[01:02:22.168 --> 01:02:23.910]  Iraqi policeman of the U.S.
[01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:27.592]  government says Iraq issues warrants for Chalibi.
[01:02:27.993 --> 01:02:29.834]  Now they're claiming he's working with Iran.
[01:02:29.874 --> 01:02:30.915]  This was their darling.
[01:02:31.315 --> 01:02:32.756]  What do you think's really behind this?
[01:02:32.776 --> 01:02:35.318]  This is the former Iranian torture master.
[01:02:36.685 --> 01:02:39.446]  For the Shah and then a convicted bank robber in Jordan.
[01:02:39.526 --> 01:02:42.528]  Now our government's kicked him out and now they want him arrested.
[01:02:43.248 --> 01:02:46.929]  Also, Iraq reinstates capital punishment from the Associated Press.
[01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:48.130]  U.S.
[01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:51.111]  soldier in Iraq abuse commended for good job.
[01:02:52.732 --> 01:02:56.754]  Also, Iraqi government shuts Al Jazeera station down.
[01:02:58.094 --> 01:03:02.596]  Bacterial infection kills 100 patients at Quebec Hospital.
[01:03:02.856 --> 01:03:03.256]  Wow! 100!
[01:03:05.427 --> 01:03:06.688]  Don't want to go to that hospital.
[01:03:07.209 --> 01:03:10.552]  Greece sets up 45-minute no-fly zone around Olympic site.
[01:03:11.072 --> 01:03:14.515]  They did that back before 9-11 at the Genoa, Italy meeting.
[01:03:14.955 --> 01:03:17.718]  Bush said he never heard of plans to fly hijacked planes into buildings.
[01:03:18.479 --> 01:03:22.002]  Also, big brother in the car, 70-90% of new cars, according to the NTSB,
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:30.404]  Have these tracker boxes in them, but now they want to make it the law that all of them have to have it.
[01:03:31.205 --> 01:03:36.130]  Also, the Boston Channel, Boston City Councilor warns against police state.
[01:03:36.951 --> 01:03:42.235]  It's all coming up, but first our guest is holding patiently on the other side of this break.
[01:03:42.255 --> 01:03:45.458]  1-800-259-9231 is the number to join us, and the website is infowars.com.
[01:03:54.631 --> 01:04:00.135]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:04:00.535 --> 01:04:04.778]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:04:05.018 --> 01:04:12.043]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:04:12.424 --> 01:04:18.528]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:04:18.668 --> 01:04:19.889]  There are no side effects.
[01:04:20.029 --> 01:04:22.270]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:04:36.997 --> 01:04:40.101]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[01:04:40.121 --> 01:04:40.161]  866-885-6625.
[01:04:40.181 --> 01:04:40.261]  866-885-6625.

[01:04:41.463 --> 01:04:41.663]  Call today.
[01:04:52.114 --> 01:05:00.736]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:05:00.956 --> 01:05:12.218]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:05:12.438 --> 01:05:15.059]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:15.419 --> 01:05:21.881]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:05:22.041 --> 01:05:23.922]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:05:24.122 --> 01:05:30.144]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:05:30.384 --> 01:05:36.046]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[01:05:36.386 --> 01:05:40.310]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:41.751]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:51.917 --> 01:05:53.458]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:05:53.618 --> 01:05:56.701]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:05:56.841 --> 01:06:00.744]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:06:00.784 --> 01:06:05.007]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:06:05.367 --> 01:06:09.150]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:06:09.290 --> 01:06:11.171]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:06:11.271 --> 01:06:14.614]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[01:06:14.654 --> 01:06:15.735]  The medical bills...
[01:06:17.396 --> 01:06:19.337]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[01:06:19.497 --> 01:06:22.539]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[01:06:22.719 --> 01:06:25.581]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:06:26.062 --> 01:06:32.186]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:06:32.726 --> 01:06:36.507]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[01:06:36.907 --> 01:06:38.288]  Order your video today.
[01:06:38.648 --> 01:06:41.268]  Call toll-free at 888-253-3139.

[01:06:52.852 --> 01:06:57.913]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.273 --> 01:07:00.554]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:03.016 --> 01:07:13.363]  Okay, folks, 8 minutes and 15 seconds into this second hour, and we do have our guest, Justin Rude.
[01:07:13.904 --> 01:07:15.125]  Justin, you heard my question.
[01:07:15.145 --> 01:07:17.666]  Sorry, we had a phone line problem for some reason.
[01:07:19.588 --> 01:07:22.490]  When you talk to these CIA and FBI people who you say are 100%
[01:07:25.783 --> 01:07:33.968]  Against this new domestic intelligence czar and this new unaccountable agency, and you say half of them are against it for constitutional reasons, what do they tell you?
[01:07:34.008 --> 01:07:35.929]  What's the feeling and the sense of these individuals?
[01:07:36.789 --> 01:07:37.229]  Can you hear me?
[01:07:37.289 --> 01:07:37.610]  Am I there?
[01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:39.050]  Yes, sir, you are there.
[01:07:39.070 --> 01:07:41.232]  All right.
[01:07:41.252 --> 01:07:50.176]  The concern is that the FBI, even post-Pay-Feed Act, still has to abide by the rules of the Attorney General in getting warrants to do these sorts of things.
[01:07:50.257 --> 01:07:52.838]  And even though those protections have been eroding,
[01:07:53.582 --> 01:07:54.203]  They're still there.
[01:07:54.423 --> 01:07:57.865]  The CIA, their specialty is breaking into houses, stealing stuff, you know?
[01:07:59.086 --> 01:08:05.029]  And the bottom line was, the folks from the CIA say, we don't want to be running these sorts of operations against U.S.
[01:08:05.069 --> 01:08:05.450]  citizens.
[01:08:05.650 --> 01:08:06.690]  That's not what we're here for.
[01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:08.471]  We're here to run against enemy countries.
[01:08:09.112 --> 01:08:20.499]  And the FBI says, you know, we have these protections, and when you take this out of the Attorney General's office, when you move this into the White House, especially when you move it into the White House, you're making it political.
[01:08:21.078 --> 01:08:29.603]  You're making it rife for abuse in kind of J. Edgar Hoover-esque ways of doing spying on political opponents and things like that.
[01:08:30.344 --> 01:08:34.566]  And you don't have the kind of protections that you have even now.
[01:08:36.427 --> 01:08:38.088]  Well, Kerry just loves it.
[01:08:38.368 --> 01:08:39.829]  I mean, this is what ought to scare us.
[01:08:39.909 --> 01:08:47.934]  The Democrats, the Republicans, and then the 9-11 Commission report blamed Congress, if any group in government, you know,
[01:08:48.954 --> 01:08:53.198]  Wasn't involved and hasn't done anything wrong other than giving up too much authority.
[01:08:53.558 --> 01:08:54.258]  It's Congress.
[01:08:54.278 --> 01:08:58.862]  So with one hand, they beat Congress over the head and say, you better give us what we want.
[01:08:59.323 --> 01:09:01.905]  We want you to give up your authority to the president.
[01:09:02.405 --> 01:09:04.747]  And in the meanwhile, they've given their authority up on trade.
[01:09:04.787 --> 01:09:06.929]  They've given up their authority on the borders.
[01:09:06.949 --> 01:09:15.576]  They're giving up their authority on everything and really setting up a dictatorial system, which the INF and World Bank are lobbying for on a global scale with all client countries.
[01:09:16.429 --> 01:09:23.211]  And yeah, the CIA folks, I mean, snatching grabs, assassinations, spying on people.
[01:09:23.251 --> 01:09:31.774]  We've caught the CIA trafficking in narcotics and relationships with major police departments, and you can argue that's rogue groups or the agency itself.
[01:09:32.134 --> 01:09:42.937]  The point is, this is classical tyranny, and it's refreshing to hear that when you talk to these individuals, that they are all concerned, but as you say, for different reasons.
[01:09:43.793 --> 01:09:44.674]  No, trust me, it is.
[01:09:45.755 --> 01:09:53.201]  When I make these phone calls and I talk to them and they say these things, it does my heart good to know that they're thinking about this stuff and concerned with it.
[01:09:53.622 --> 01:10:08.114]  A lot of these people rose up in the ranks of both the CIA and the FBI after some of the worst abuses in the 60s and 70s and learned from good experience that when you do that, you run a risk of getting caught.
[01:10:08.556 --> 01:10:09.216]  Yeah, no, Justin.
[01:10:30.732 --> 01:10:32.253]  It's all compartmentalized.
[01:10:33.073 --> 01:10:36.555]  I mean, I'd say 80% of the beehive honeycomb is good people.
[01:10:36.995 --> 01:10:39.677]  But that 20% seems to always be on top.
[01:10:41.238 --> 01:10:45.360]  And 5% of that 20% are complete psychopathic sociopaths.
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:49.102]  We've caught the FBI running murder for hire, prostitutes, drugs.
[01:10:49.122 --> 01:10:50.443]  We've caught the CIA doing it.
[01:10:50.723 --> 01:10:54.185]  We've caught the CIA kidnapping people and doing mind control experiments.
[01:10:54.205 --> 01:10:55.546]  I mean, that's all come out in Congress.
[01:10:55.666 --> 01:10:59.848]  So my point is that you give unlimited power to anybody.
[01:11:00.528 --> 01:11:05.192]  Over time, it's going to have a race to the bottom because no oversight causes that.
[01:11:05.712 --> 01:11:28.731]  And our founding fathers said we need a separation of powers and to have this huge race to consolidate authority in the executive is the classic sequence of events or the classic field or paradigm reading that always creates tyranny.
[01:11:29.651 --> 01:11:57.525]  No, you're absolutely right, and I think that there's, you know, I live in Washington, I report in Washington, and so much of this just seems like improvised theater, you know, going on between the two, between the Democrats and the Republicans, and the Congress and the White House, but it is a very serious issue, and I don't think that especially as the debate is raging over this new counterterrorism, this new intelligence star, this new counterterrorism center, people realize, you know, what the really important constitutional issues are that are at stake.
[01:11:58.012 --> 01:12:12.323]  Well, what's happening is all of this... I mean, Ridge puts out a four-year-old or three-and-a-half-year-old terror report on Sunday, and surprise, surprise, on Monday, Bush announces his initiative for this, which is a good backdrop for it.
[01:12:15.333 --> 01:12:19.635]  I mean, it's very transparent what's happening here, and now they're saying brace for terror attacks.
[01:12:19.975 --> 01:12:21.115]  They're going to happen any minute.
[01:12:21.375 --> 01:12:22.076]  They told U.S.
[01:12:22.096 --> 01:12:25.737]  News and World Report that it was going to happen.
[01:12:25.777 --> 01:12:28.738]  The only thing you can do is give your rights up, and then we can keep you safe.
[01:12:29.618 --> 01:12:39.062]  So I'm worried that we're going to have a big terror attack, and we're going to get the national draft, our new domestic KGB or Stasi, and just the end of this country completely.
[01:12:39.082 --> 01:12:40.262]  I don't know.
[01:12:40.283 --> 01:12:44.064]  There's a lot of stuff, Alex, I'd like to say is unimaginable, and you'd say that it would never happen here.
[01:12:44.631 --> 01:12:47.313]  And certainly I think some of those things could be.
[01:12:47.333 --> 01:12:54.437]  But on the other hand, if you asked somebody four or five years ago if you would have thought we would have gone to war in Iraq or some of these other things would have happened, I think they would have said the same thing.
[01:12:54.517 --> 01:12:57.939]  So it's certainly made life interesting.
[01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:01.601]  Well, let's spend a few minutes on this great article you've written.
[01:13:01.621 --> 01:13:06.304]  And this is, again, posted at salon.com or you said page15.com?
[01:13:06.324 --> 01:13:06.504]  Correct.
[01:13:08.530 --> 01:13:11.092]  And, of course, we have links to this on InfoWars.com.
[01:13:11.172 --> 01:13:12.894]  Protection or paranoia?
[01:13:12.994 --> 01:13:19.960]  Why is the Secret Service treating harmless professors and pacifists, homeless advocates, like they're members of Al-Qaeda?
[01:13:21.841 --> 01:13:23.082]  Can you tell us about this article?
[01:13:23.523 --> 01:13:23.783]  Sure.
[01:13:23.823 --> 01:13:27.806]  This was an incident that took place a couple weeks ago in Duluth, Minnesota.
[01:13:27.846 --> 01:13:33.111]  There was a Bush-Cheney 04 rally, a presidential campaign rally, and President Bush was appearing.
[01:13:34.246 --> 01:13:38.328]  And it was an interesting choice because Duluth is a majority Democratic city.
[01:13:39.029 --> 01:13:40.609]  Minnesota is a pretty Democratic state.
[01:13:41.530 --> 01:13:49.374]  But it's also, and I don't think there's a link between the two, but it's also pretty heavy in terms of terrorist arrests that you've seen.
[01:13:49.714 --> 01:13:56.177]  You know, Mousali was in Minneapolis, I guess, and there was this guy, Ouassame, who was there as well.
[01:13:57.507 --> 01:14:08.175]  So the Secret Service had a good reason to be on guard, but what we found out that was who they were on guard for, for the most part, seemed to be political protesters, nonviolent political protesters.
[01:14:08.215 --> 01:14:22.867]  They had these posters put up around the security checkpoints at the event, and they were featuring these kind of mug shots, as they were described to me, these identification photos of one guy was an avowed pacifist.
[01:14:23.508 --> 01:14:24.609]  He ran a homeless shelter.
[01:14:25.965 --> 01:14:29.187]  And another guy was a history professor at the University of Wisconsin.
[01:14:29.607 --> 01:14:33.109]  Nice guy, 40-year-old guy, who was also a member of the Green Party.
[01:14:33.850 --> 01:14:42.374]  And everybody had kind of a question as to why the Secret Service, when there's a lot of other strange people running around, happened to pick them to be the ones to watch out for.
[01:14:43.815 --> 01:14:53.001]  Well, also, I mean, we've had activists, conservative, liberal activists, who have no criminal record, try to fly to a political meeting, and they're barred from flying.
[01:14:53.502 --> 01:14:54.742]  Oh, you're on the watch list.
[01:14:55.363 --> 01:15:02.427]  And we have protesters inside cages, inside other cages, with people aiming M60 machine guns at them, men in Darth Vader outfits.
[01:15:03.288 --> 01:15:06.550]  We have free speech zones, you know, a mile, two miles away.
[01:15:08.552 --> 01:15:11.694]  They're now arresting people, but then if you're a probos, you can stand there.
[01:15:11.734 --> 01:15:13.315]  We have Cheney making people sign,
[01:15:14.375 --> 01:15:16.396]  Yeah, no, it definitely is.
[01:15:16.436 --> 01:15:26.578]  And for somebody like you and I that make our living off the First Amendment, it's heartening to see in some cases, like in Boston, that the First Amendment zones were more or less ignored by a lot of the protesters.
[01:15:41.623 --> 01:15:44.224]  And small victories like that.
[01:15:44.484 --> 01:15:55.127]  That was a small victory, but it gave the illusion to the 290 million Americans that you're some type of criminal or two-headed demon with 12 eyes.
[01:15:55.147 --> 01:15:57.107]  If you're a protester, why?
[01:15:57.207 --> 01:16:00.928]  It's scary why men aim guns at you and you get put in cages.
[01:16:01.008 --> 01:16:02.589]  So why would you want to protest?
[01:16:02.649 --> 01:16:06.550]  And it chilled the protest down to just a few thousand instead of hundreds of thousands.
[01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:07.730]  Absolutely.
[01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:09.731]  I think that you make some very valid points, Doug.
[01:16:11.052 --> 01:16:29.208]  I mean, it becomes almost comical, the sort of debate that goes on about the Great Lawn and Central Park, which, I mean, if there was ever a piece of grass that was designed for gatherings of hundreds of thousands of people at Central Park, and they're saying they can't have a protest there because they may hurt the grass.
[01:16:29.228 --> 01:16:30.930]  Because they may hurt the grass.
[01:16:31.190 --> 01:16:33.592]  I mean, and you just don't understand how they can come up with
[01:16:34.615 --> 01:16:37.976]  With arguments like this, to stop something that's such an essential American right.
[01:16:38.376 --> 01:16:44.638]  You know, as far as the no-fly list and the activists that have been stopped there as well, both on the left and the right, you're absolutely right.
[01:16:44.678 --> 01:16:51.540]  And the ACLU of Northern California has a case going on about that right now and trying to get documents released.
[01:16:51.620 --> 01:17:02.203]  And that whole issue of who gets on these lists and how can you find out if you're on the list, I was at a great congressional hearing with the head of the Terrorist Screening Center, which was supposed to keep track of all these watch lists.
[01:17:02.891 --> 01:17:09.355]  And one of the congressmen said, you know, how do you find out if your name is on the list and how do you get it off if it's not supposed to be?
[01:17:10.096 --> 01:17:15.439]  And the person who runs the center, Donna Buscella, said, well, that's easy.
[01:17:15.459 --> 01:17:20.863]  You would contact us and we're setting up an office and somebody will write you back and let you know if you're not on the list.
[01:17:21.383 --> 01:17:23.865]  And the congressman said, well, but what if I am on the list?
[01:17:24.345 --> 01:17:26.407]  And there was a whole bunch of whispering that went on at the table.
[01:17:26.827 --> 01:17:31.530]  And then she turned on her microphone and said, well, we probably wouldn't send you a letter in that case.
[01:17:32.293 --> 01:17:39.878]  So the new precedent is you can't, because it's going to be in buses and trains now too, or fly, and then, oh, you can't have a car.
[01:17:40.258 --> 01:17:47.563]  I saw Ridge two years ago at a C-SPAN meeting say you're going to have a car to have a job, it'll be on your license, what security clearance you have to have any job.
[01:17:47.583 --> 01:17:54.148]  And this is going to be our new life is we're all going to have a color coding and I guess you just can't do anything or go anywhere.
[01:17:54.168 --> 01:18:02.033]  That's like Nazi Germany where whole groups have no recourse and there's no charges, they don't arrest you, they just limit your mobility.
[01:18:02.433 --> 01:18:13.658]  And this is something that this Terrace Screening Center, which had originally been created to organize all of these watch lists for transportation, like you said, you're absolutely right.
[01:18:13.698 --> 01:18:26.724]  I mean, they say in the documents themselves that they create the center that one of the purposes they like to use this for is for helping, for instance, to be used by private industry when they need to do security checks.
[01:18:26.764 --> 01:18:30.306]  So if you get your name on that list for whatever reason and you want to work at
[01:18:30.805 --> 01:18:35.567]  You know, for now, we'll say a nuclear power plant, but I mean, they're defining everything as critical infrastructure now.
[01:18:35.707 --> 01:18:37.108]  Have you written an article about that?
[01:18:37.148 --> 01:18:41.010]  Because I saw Ridge say it two years ago, and I'd like to get the documents.
[01:18:42.031 --> 01:18:42.531]  No, I haven't.
[01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.092]  I'm certainly happy to send you the documents.
[01:18:44.152 --> 01:18:45.932]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[01:18:46.853 --> 01:18:47.533]  One more segment.
[01:18:47.553 --> 01:18:50.195]  Just do five more minutes with us, because I want to talk about that when we get back.
[01:18:50.235 --> 01:18:50.815]  That's a big deal.
[01:18:52.358 --> 01:18:53.119]  Terrorism.
[01:18:53.279 --> 01:18:54.019]  Terrorism.
[01:18:54.119 --> 01:18:54.960]  Chemical attacks.
[01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:55.701]  Dirty bombs.
[01:18:55.801 --> 01:18:56.201]  Fallout.
[01:18:56.281 --> 01:18:57.282]  Biological attack.
[01:18:57.462 --> 01:18:58.003]  Anthrax.
[01:18:58.063 --> 01:19:00.184]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:19:00.445 --> 01:19:02.046]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:19:02.286 --> 01:19:04.768]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:19:05.148 --> 01:19:19.720]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:20.080]  government.
[01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:22.062]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:19:22.422 --> 01:19:28.343]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:19:28.483 --> 01:19:32.984]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[01:19:33.224 --> 01:19:39.925]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:19:40.005 --> 01:19:42.646]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:53.001]  Attention, investors.
[01:19:53.201 --> 01:19:57.464]  Are you looking for above-average returns and willing to take a risk in order to achieve them?
[01:19:57.744 --> 01:20:01.867]  I'm Patrick T. Parker from Barclay Financial, a specialty firm in futures and options.
[01:20:02.147 --> 01:20:04.869]  Now, I know that futures and options are a mystery to most people.
[01:20:05.169 --> 01:20:11.714]  Let us help you solve that mystery, because futures and options investing involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for everyone.
[01:20:12.194 --> 01:20:16.697]  Right now we're making a major recommendation in the energy markets, and specifically heating oil.
[01:20:17.057 --> 01:20:21.000]  Currently known market news may already be factored into the underlying market price.
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:22.981]  Energy prices have been on the move.
[01:20:23.321 --> 01:20:25.683]  America is in an energy crisis.
[01:20:26.043 --> 01:20:27.744]  OPEC hasn't kept up on supplies.
[01:20:28.064 --> 01:20:30.365]  Refineries haven't been able to keep up with demand.
[01:20:30.626 --> 01:20:32.547]  Demand from China has been insatiable.
[01:20:33.067 --> 01:20:34.810]  Discover the options for your future.

[01:20:47.429 --> 01:20:48.389]  Barclay Financial.
[01:20:48.909 --> 01:20:49.950]  Mystery solved.
[01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:55.031]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[01:20:55.251 --> 01:20:58.692]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[01:20:58.912 --> 01:20:59.992]  No, not a meteorologist.
[01:21:00.072 --> 01:21:01.372]  A lot of schooling and experience.
[01:21:01.612 --> 01:21:10.194]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[01:21:10.575 --> 01:21:16.336]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[01:21:16.616 --> 01:21:18.597]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.

[01:21:32.804 --> 01:21:33.304]  That's right.

[01:21:45.218 --> 01:21:46.822]  Call today and avoid getting soaked tomorrow.
[01:21:51.315 --> 01:21:55.059]  In today's world of discord and disappointment, one thing's for sure.
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:22:00.085]  Car cover owners are so satisfied, they buy their car covers all over again.
[01:22:00.105 --> 01:22:01.887]  Think car covers are a hassle?
[01:22:02.147 --> 01:22:02.368]  No.
[01:22:02.708 --> 01:22:06.472]  Research shows owners find covers easy to put on and take off.
[01:22:06.873 --> 01:22:08.214]  Are all covers the same?
[01:22:08.474 --> 01:22:08.695]  No.
[01:22:08.995 --> 01:22:12.599]  The standard in car cover fabric is Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[01:22:13.039 --> 01:22:15.160]  Don't let sun and dust damage your car.
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:17.961]  Kimberly Clark's Block-It Fabric's got you covered.
[01:22:18.241 --> 01:22:20.062]  That's Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[01:22:20.142 --> 01:22:22.203]  Cool weather brings cool cars.
[01:22:22.643 --> 01:22:23.544]  I don't think so.
[01:22:23.864 --> 01:22:27.505]  A cooling system can run too hot or too cold if not prepared for winter.
[01:22:27.866 --> 01:22:28.886]  Here's your to-do.
[01:22:29.106 --> 01:22:31.887]  Ask your local shop to perform the BG Coolant Flush.
[01:22:32.087 --> 01:22:37.710]  A simple test strip tells if your coolant's protecting the engine from temperature extremes or breaking down and corroding.
[01:22:38.070 --> 01:22:42.254]  The BG Chemistry cleans the system, then adds new coolant with conditioners.
[01:22:42.474 --> 01:22:47.319]  Ask your shop for a BG Coolant Flush, or go to bgfindashop.com.
[01:22:47.539 --> 01:22:49.161]  That's bgfindashop.com.
[01:23:08.195 --> 01:23:11.616]  All right, it's our final segment with Justin Rude.
[01:23:12.836 --> 01:23:20.219]  And we don't have a big staff here, and I have literally hundreds of VHS tapes, hundreds of CDs we've burned from TV shows.
[01:23:21.639 --> 01:23:23.560]  But I talk about this all the time.
[01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:28.321]  Two years ago, I saw Governor Ridge at a meeting before Homeland Security even got funded.
[01:23:29.353 --> 01:23:36.515]  And he was there saying, you're going to have an ID card, your state driver's license, federally issued and mandated by the Maritime Administration.
[01:23:37.755 --> 01:23:40.616]  On that, it's going to have what your security clearance is.
[01:23:40.676 --> 01:23:42.116]  It's going to be critical infrastructure.
[01:23:42.436 --> 01:23:48.698]  He said nuclear power plants, water plants, food industry, taxi drivers, 18-wheeler drivers.
[01:23:49.738 --> 01:23:53.739]  And then he went on to list food service, agricultural workers, everything.
[01:23:54.930 --> 01:24:17.453]  And then, just last, what was it, Thursday or Friday, it was Thursday, I had the aide-de-camp, the lieutenant on for the general from the Alabama Defense Force, where they issue anyone who wants them, MP arm badges, no training, uniforms, and they go search people on the city streets of Mobile, and this is going on in 30 states, so...
[01:24:18.093 --> 01:24:19.174]  This is the new system.
[01:24:19.194 --> 01:24:20.475]  You're not a good little globalist.
[01:24:20.495 --> 01:24:21.535]  You can't get a job.
[01:24:22.015 --> 01:24:29.280]  Can you speak to your knowledge of what this new anti-terrorism czar is going to be doing with this system?
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:31.561]  Well, it's not really clear.
[01:24:31.861 --> 01:24:37.724]  You know, it's turned into such an octopus, this Homeland Security kind of apparatus, an intelligence apparatus.
[01:24:37.805 --> 01:24:40.246]  It's hard to understand exactly where the authorities lie.
[01:24:40.946 --> 01:24:43.308]  The Terrorist Screening Center is something that's under the FBI.
[01:24:45.019 --> 01:24:48.141]  And is there to assemble all these watch lists.
[01:24:48.201 --> 01:24:53.245]  And it's not clear, again, what happens to that program if this National Counterterrorism Center is created.
[01:24:55.567 --> 01:25:02.032]  Just to back up, just for some bureaucratic trivia, the Department of Homeland Security was supposed to be doing all this in the first place.
[01:25:02.052 --> 01:25:03.893]  That's one of the reasons they said it was going to be created.
[01:25:03.913 --> 01:25:08.637]  And then the White House decided that the CIA should do it.
[01:25:08.657 --> 01:25:09.758]  So they gave it to the CIA.
[01:25:09.798 --> 01:25:12.900]  And now the 9-11 Commission has said, well, no, the CIA shouldn't do it.
[01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:14.161]  We should put it, I guess, in the White House.
[01:25:14.642 --> 01:25:16.485]  So now they want to create this national counterterrorism.
[01:25:16.625 --> 01:25:18.207]  And really, it's an enemy's list.
[01:25:18.848 --> 01:25:19.890]  Well, you know, it's not.
[01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:23.174]  They say there's over 160,000 people on there.
[01:25:23.194 --> 01:25:24.096]  That's a lot of enemies.
[01:25:24.216 --> 01:25:26.399]  So, I mean, who knows who's on that list?
[01:25:27.366 --> 01:25:31.430]  If they've come up with 160,000 terrorists, I think they've really done their homework.
[01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:41.858]  Well, we just know that a 72-year-old rancher having his property taken goes to a land right meeting in Congress and can't fly out of Butte, Montana because he's on the list.
[01:25:41.918 --> 01:25:49.084]  A green activist, a 60-year-old woman with no criminal record, is going to the Green Party convention and can't get on an airplane.
[01:25:49.104 --> 01:25:50.765]  I mean, I've interviewed all these people.
[01:25:50.945 --> 01:25:52.387]  And then they go, take me off the list.
[01:25:52.427 --> 01:25:54.368]  And they go, no, it's national security.
[01:25:54.408 --> 01:25:55.329]  We can't talk to you.
[01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:58.311]  And now they say for every job we're going to have this done.
[01:25:58.672 --> 01:26:01.294]  And Ridge says maritime, but that was two years ago.
[01:26:01.674 --> 01:26:05.778]  Now it's going to be the FBI, and now it's going to be the White House and the CIA.
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:15.245]  I mean, this is not among the better ideas that have come out of Washington in the last few years, to be absolutely frank.
[01:26:17.591 --> 01:26:27.194]  You know, they talk about using this list to screen for applicants to a job, say, you know, the example that they used when I've spoken with them is for a nuclear power plant.
[01:26:27.234 --> 01:26:29.535]  You know, you don't want a terrorist to get a job at a nuclear power plant.
[01:26:30.835 --> 01:26:34.917]  But, you know, when you start expanding... As if they don't do giant background checks anyways.
[01:26:35.097 --> 01:26:36.197]  Right, right, right.
[01:26:37.437 --> 01:26:39.858]  And not to say that, well, anyway.
[01:26:40.258 --> 01:26:42.639]  I mean, terrorists have been able to find ways around everything else.
[01:26:42.679 --> 01:26:45.360]  I don't see why a screening center is going to help that a whole lot.
[01:26:46.851 --> 01:26:49.776]  But it seems like references and things like that might go a little bit further.
[01:26:50.998 --> 01:26:55.505]  But yeah, no, it's not really clear as to where this all goes.
[01:26:56.607 --> 01:26:58.329]  Bad ideas come from a lot of different places.
[01:26:59.031 --> 01:27:01.114]  Bad ideas exist and survive.
[01:27:02.290 --> 01:27:05.212]  Because people feel like they need to get something done.
[01:27:05.232 --> 01:27:06.773]  They need to do something.
[01:27:07.373 --> 01:27:08.814]  And there's a sense of urgency.
[01:27:08.874 --> 01:27:09.894]  Here's another example.
[01:27:09.934 --> 01:27:21.701]  The CAPS2 system said it was going to lower your code color level at least to yellow to where you'd be singled out for extra screening and interrogation if you have bad credit.
[01:27:22.041 --> 01:27:22.281]  Right.
[01:27:22.561 --> 01:27:26.423]  Now to go get a home loan, they go through an FBI check.
[01:27:26.463 --> 01:27:27.383]  I mean, this is a joke.
[01:27:27.424 --> 01:27:30.045]  This is about getting total control in our daily lives.
[01:27:31.289 --> 01:27:33.010]  It's a problem.
[01:27:33.130 --> 01:27:50.200]  I think they're applying kind of an understanding of technology that's 30 or 40 years old, and they don't understand that there are much more sophisticated ways to deal with information and with people than something as blanket as pulling people out for checks because they have bad credit.
[01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:56.223]  I mean, we can certainly be more sophisticated with what's essentially publicly available information, like a credit check.
[01:27:58.291 --> 01:28:03.175]  But, again, I mean, this is kind of setting up a move towards debtor prisons.
[01:28:03.195 --> 01:28:05.877]  You know, you'd lose some of your rights if you've got bad credit.
[01:28:06.017 --> 01:28:06.257]  Right.
[01:28:06.518 --> 01:28:09.620]  Well, I tell you, Justin Rude, I appreciate you joining us.
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:12.903]  Page15.com, Salon.com.
[01:28:14.404 --> 01:28:19.768]  You write a lot of great in-depth articles and very informative, and I want to thank you for coming on with us.
[01:28:19.888 --> 01:28:20.309]  Thank you.
[01:28:20.989 --> 01:28:21.750]  Take care, my friend.
[01:28:21.810 --> 01:28:21.990]  Take care.
[01:28:22.944 --> 01:28:32.653]  All right, we're going to come back and take your calls and get into, well, talk of the national draft, and they're preparing for riots if there's a national draft, and the U.N.
[01:28:32.693 --> 01:28:35.075]  monitoring our elections and a lot more at 1-800-259-9231.

[01:28:55.012 --> 01:28:58.013]  Jungle Joe, Spike, Firma Queen, Cher Ami, or G.I.
[01:28:58.073 --> 01:28:58.373]  Joe?
[01:28:58.633 --> 01:29:01.114]  If you guessed they're all American heroes, you guessed right.
[01:29:01.435 --> 01:29:04.596]  But these heroes don't belong to any crack military commando unit.
[01:29:04.756 --> 01:29:07.477]  These true American heroes are American homing pigeons.
[01:29:07.877 --> 01:29:11.079]  That's right, registered pedigreed American homing pigeons.
[01:29:11.319 --> 01:29:18.822]  Although the homing pigeon no longer delivers life-saving messages on the battlefield, they are engaged throughout the world as thoroughbreds in exciting racing contests
[01:29:18.962 --> 01:29:19.482]  We're good to go.
[01:29:43.991 --> 01:29:47.061]  Call the ARPU today.

[01:30:53.595 --> 01:30:54.576]  Spring has arrived.
[01:30:54.756 --> 01:30:57.717]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:30:57.937 --> 01:31:01.418]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:31:01.618 --> 01:31:09.720]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the ARK Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[01:31:54.099 --> 01:31:56.860]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:00.701]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:06.753 --> 01:32:07.653]  All right, my friends.
[01:32:07.693 --> 01:32:11.315]  We're going to go to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:32:13.235 --> 01:32:14.516]  We'll talk about the U.N.
[01:32:14.536 --> 01:32:18.417]  wanting to come in and certify the phony elections.
[01:32:19.638 --> 01:32:22.438]  Need to get into draft riots feared.
[01:32:23.159 --> 01:32:26.540]  No matter who wins in November, conscription will return.
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:27.980]  American Free Press headline.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.402]  I want to cover that before I go to your calls, and we'll do that first.
[01:32:33.485 --> 01:32:38.588]  But I would like to also encourage all of you to go sign up at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:32:39.889 --> 01:32:53.297]  If you're online, and you spend a lot of time on the computer, and you're like myself, you've stopped watching television, or you don't watch that much of it, you'd like to be interactive, prisonplanet.tv is 15 cents a day, folks.
[01:32:54.137 --> 01:33:00.781]  And it has all of my videos, a bunch of other documentaries by other great researchers that have authorized us to post them.
[01:33:02.685 --> 01:33:06.106]  And it's in high bandwidth and low bandwidth, depending on what your connection is.
[01:33:06.786 --> 01:33:08.887]  We have my book, Paul Watson's book.
[01:33:09.907 --> 01:33:13.688]  We have the best radio interviews we do each week are posted there.
[01:33:14.768 --> 01:33:17.249]  Original stories just for members are posted there.
[01:33:17.869 --> 01:33:27.392]  PrisonPlanet.tv, and of course we did this because the bandwidth in having four websites for free and having millions of visitors a month, we just couldn't continue.
[01:33:27.712 --> 01:33:31.293]  Plus, people would like something that's exclusive and privileged and
[01:33:32.163 --> 01:33:33.184]  It's a great system.
[01:33:33.244 --> 01:33:35.965]  PrisonPlanet.tv, PayPal, credit card, whatever.

[01:33:42.469 --> 01:33:43.830]  Your information goes nowhere.
[01:33:43.950 --> 01:33:45.491]  We don't even, frankly, look at it.
[01:33:45.511 --> 01:33:46.192]  We're so busy.
[01:33:46.932 --> 01:33:48.213]  So total privacy as well.
[01:33:48.653 --> 01:33:56.197]  We also have our secure, safe shopping cart, my friends, where you can order any of the ten films I produce or any of the videos.
[01:33:56.217 --> 01:33:56.598]  I don't know.
[01:33:56.658 --> 01:33:58.879]  I'm carrying about six, seven videos by other.
[01:33:59.439 --> 01:34:00.280]  It's more than that now.
[01:34:00.928 --> 01:34:06.891]  We've got Jews, the Preservation of Firearms, Ownership's new video, Innocence Portrayed, that everybody's got to see.
[01:34:07.251 --> 01:34:10.772]  About 180 million people killed after government gun control worldwide.
[01:34:11.093 --> 01:34:13.233]  That comes with three free booklets when you order it.
[01:34:13.714 --> 01:34:18.836]  We have George Humphrey's new video, 9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati.
[01:34:19.676 --> 01:34:24.078]  And it comes with a free color booklet when you order a copy of that for $19.95.
[01:34:24.518 --> 01:34:25.579]  Get a second copy for $10.
[01:34:27.461 --> 01:34:35.989]  For $14.95 and get three booklets, so $34.95, two videos or DVDs, and three color booklets, picture booklets full of documents on 9-11.
[01:34:37.271 --> 01:34:44.618]  Also, my two 9-11 films, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny and The Masters of Terror Exposed, and my Police State films and my Bohemian Grove video.
[01:34:45.487 --> 01:34:48.991]  My videos are $25.95 because they're all over two hours long.
[01:34:50.352 --> 01:34:52.434]  $20 when you order three or more of any of the ten titles.
[01:34:52.454 --> 01:35:01.763]  If you've got any questions about other discounts on books or t-shirts or any of the titles or what the films cover, you can call our operators and they've got descriptions and information for you.
[01:35:01.783 --> 01:35:02.664]  You can ask them questions.
[01:35:02.684 --> 01:35:02.724]  1-888-
[01:35:05.086 --> 01:35:07.846]  I will get to this draft article in the U.N.
[01:35:07.866 --> 01:35:15.328]  election situation before this hour ends, but you guys have been holding so long, I don't want to make the callers hold.
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:38.883]  Let's go to calls now, but I'm going to give each caller about a minute, minute and a half, okay?
[01:35:39.404 --> 01:35:42.046]  So say what you've got to say, and we'll get to the next person, to be fair.
[01:35:42.526 --> 01:35:44.848]  Mike in Colorado, go ahead, you're on the air, sir.
[01:35:45.428 --> 01:35:46.609]  Hi, Alex, this is Mike.
[01:35:47.130 --> 01:35:47.410]  Yes, sir.
[01:35:48.471 --> 01:35:58.279]  I was wondering, have you heard about the, on 9-11, the plane that, the United Airlines plane that crashed into the building, that it didn't have windows?
[01:35:59.591 --> 01:36:06.252]  Well, I've looked at the video, and Dave on Colossus covered that and done a great job, and it doesn't look like it has windows, and eyewitnesses said that.
[01:36:06.972 --> 01:36:13.774]  The first plane, and they're not happy that there's video of that, and there's a weird pod on the bottom of the other one.
[01:36:14.254 --> 01:36:16.494]  I mean, just a lot of strange stuff.
[01:36:17.214 --> 01:36:25.036]  And again, you've got a 12-foot wide hole at the Pentagon, and then it caves in later, but nothing on the grass, no nothing.
[01:36:25.076 --> 01:36:27.536]  I mean, those are really Associated Press photos.
[01:36:28.403 --> 01:36:30.965]  And I think it's an important area that should be examined.
[01:36:31.906 --> 01:36:36.670]  I cover other areas of 9-11 that we can totally document, but I think it's important to look at.
[01:36:37.330 --> 01:36:44.236]  And the other question I had was on that plane crashing into the building.
[01:36:44.716 --> 01:36:52.062]  The news reporter, Mark Brubacher, that worked for Fox News, I got a hold of the company and they fired him.
[01:36:53.968 --> 01:36:54.849]  Okay, I'm confused.
[01:36:54.889 --> 01:36:55.649]  What are you talking about?
[01:36:55.869 --> 01:36:59.672]  The guy that did the report on that, there was a reporter that worked for Fox News at the time?
[01:37:00.252 --> 01:37:00.492]  Yes.
[01:37:00.752 --> 01:37:02.433]  He said that plane did not have windows.
[01:37:02.473 --> 01:37:03.214]  He said it twice.
[01:37:03.534 --> 01:37:04.034]  No, I know.
[01:37:04.234 --> 01:37:04.955]  And they fired him.
[01:37:06.015 --> 01:37:06.696]  Right after that?
[01:37:06.876 --> 01:37:07.036]  Yep.
[01:37:08.277 --> 01:37:09.297]  That's what they told me today.
[01:37:09.337 --> 01:37:10.618]  He's no longer with the company.
[01:37:10.758 --> 01:37:12.919]  I don't know if they fired him, but I'm sure they did.
[01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:14.741]  Well, see, we don't know they fired him.
[01:37:14.761 --> 01:37:15.621]  Thanks for the call, Mike.
[01:37:16.322 --> 01:37:17.762]  Regina in Pennsylvania.
[01:37:17.802 --> 01:37:18.583]  Regina, go ahead.
[01:37:19.286 --> 01:37:20.146]  Hi, Alex.
[01:37:20.387 --> 01:37:27.650]  I wish that I could have asked the man a question, but maybe if you ever get him back on, you could ask him if he has any contact with Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:37:27.670 --> 01:37:44.759]  The reason I'm saying that is an experience this weekend where I got to talk to a state rep that I do like, I've been involved with on some of this No Child Left Behind, and I find it interesting that now that Bush is running, it seemed to turn into pretty much of a Bush-Cheney rally.
[01:37:45.319 --> 01:37:47.340]  I tried to feed information to people, but
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:51.141]  As usual, I was kind of... So explain this to me.
[01:37:51.181 --> 01:37:59.205]  I mean, No Child Left Behind is socialism, social workers, the psychological testing of children, the breakup of the family, 12-hour school days.
[01:37:59.225 --> 01:38:00.686]  They want to make them go to 8 o'clock at night.
[01:38:01.026 --> 01:38:03.587]  Lazy parents, of course, will do that because they don't have to take care of their children.
[01:38:03.927 --> 01:38:06.789]  I mean, that's what No Child Left Behind is, federal testing, all this.
[01:38:07.129 --> 01:38:11.251]  But I'm confused about the context of a Cheney rally, No Child Left Behind.
[01:38:11.271 --> 01:38:12.972]  Well, I'm just saying it became...
[01:38:13.932 --> 01:38:18.456]  Basically, it was kind of a pig roast for a representative that I do like that's a Republican.
[01:38:18.516 --> 01:38:20.278]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:38:20.458 --> 01:38:25.563]  Now because Bush is behind, no child left behind, suddenly so-called conservatives think it's great.
[01:38:25.583 --> 01:38:26.183]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:38:26.543 --> 01:38:33.910]  Right, and what I'd like to ask this man, because we have so many bills and he's so close to Congress, he could help us, because we hear this all the time, you know,
[01:38:34.494 --> 01:38:37.978]  Well, this is going to do this, and this is going to give more power to this, and all this kind of stuff.
[01:38:37.998 --> 01:38:39.040]  But we know that, Alex.
[01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:41.302]  You've trained us well, and we've watched you.
[01:38:41.402 --> 01:38:42.564]  I've not trained anybody.
[01:38:42.684 --> 01:38:43.385]  Well, you know what I mean, Alex.
[01:38:43.405 --> 01:38:45.828]  I wish I could train myself to not be obnoxious, but go ahead.
[01:38:45.868 --> 01:38:47.550]  That is not a negative thing, okay?
[01:38:48.471 --> 01:38:50.233]  I meant, you've helped us through this.
[01:38:50.293 --> 01:38:51.054]  But the point is...
[01:38:51.687 --> 01:39:00.836]  That in that situation, he could get a hold of Ron Paul and start following what he's doing, and he could whisper in the ears of some of these congressmen that, oh, they feel so overwhelmed because all this stuff is happening.
[01:39:00.856 --> 01:39:11.407]  Well, I mean, this guy writes for Salon, a bunch of other big publications, but he writes directly, you know, to advise Congress and other people, and he's saying 100% of CIA and FBI talk to are upset.
[01:39:13.010 --> 01:39:17.852]  And half of them think that, you know, I mean, I said, this could be a dictatorship, and he said, yes.
[01:39:18.292 --> 01:39:19.853]  Sounds horrible, but yes.
[01:39:19.893 --> 01:39:25.595]  I mean, even mainstream people like Justin Rude are starting to freak out, and he said 100%.
[01:39:25.635 --> 01:39:28.176]  And see, that's the experience I've had.
[01:39:28.456 --> 01:39:38.000]  But what I'm saying here is the solution to my question, okay, about what are we going to do now, no child left behind, isn't it still a problem, then I wanted to know,
[01:39:39.063 --> 01:39:39.765]  What are we going to do?
[01:39:39.785 --> 01:39:47.161]  I got this stare look in my eye here, and I was trying to bring up the point that states will have to...
[01:39:51.071 --> 01:39:55.994]  Okay, how can this guy who studies Homeland Security, how does this deal with that wrong call?
[01:39:56.014 --> 01:40:10.580]  Well, because what I'm saying here is UNESCO, we allow Bush to put it to UNESCO, takes congressional authority off of our congressmen, and then they're all surprised Oh yeah, that's a great example that we have Congress giving away its authority on trade, on UNESCO, yes.
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:15.722]  Okay, so what I'm going to say here, and I'll try to say it as quick as I can, is the proposal that came out was
[01:40:16.323 --> 01:40:20.204]  Okay, the school districts can fight this now.
[01:40:20.464 --> 01:40:23.664]  They can put a referendum before the people when it's time to raise taxes.
[01:40:23.704 --> 01:40:31.506]  And my question to the state rep, who I thought was fighting this, but now all of a sudden because Bush is in, he has to get Bush in and we'll figure out all this kind of stuff.
[01:40:31.806 --> 01:40:44.248]  Okay, the referendum, I said, well, when that school district is forced under that federal law from the government to make sure that that child that comes in as an illegal has to have that language.
[01:40:45.006 --> 01:40:46.927]  How are they going to say no to that?
[01:40:46.967 --> 01:40:48.528]  Because you're not stopping the law.
[01:40:48.548 --> 01:40:48.848]  I hear you.
[01:40:48.888 --> 01:40:49.989]  Thanks for the call, Regina.
[01:40:50.829 --> 01:40:53.411]  Let's go ahead and go to Paul in Delaware.
[01:40:53.451 --> 01:40:54.191]  Paul, go ahead.
[01:40:54.732 --> 01:40:55.272]  Hi, Alex.
[01:40:55.512 --> 01:40:55.672]  Hello.
[01:40:55.692 --> 01:40:56.493]  How are you doing?
[01:40:56.673 --> 01:40:57.413]  Good.
[01:40:57.673 --> 01:41:10.901]  I'm calling because, as a Christian, I have to tell you that it's disheartening that me and you cannot have a discussion without you attacking me and you telling me that I'm demonizing you.
[01:41:11.656 --> 01:41:16.579]  Yet you can speak to David Icke with more respect than you do me.
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:25.725]  I just have to say that I don't appreciate that, but I do like the work that you're doing.
[01:41:25.805 --> 01:41:32.009]  The issues that you won't speak towards, you give David Icke a show.
[01:41:33.470 --> 01:41:40.195]  I understand if you don't want to talk about people, but it's very dangerous, for example, when you have an FBI agent.
[01:41:41.317 --> 01:41:41.757]  Retard.
[01:41:42.077 --> 01:41:43.338]  That's going around the country.
[01:41:45.018 --> 01:41:45.878]  Making up stuff.
[01:41:46.138 --> 01:41:47.759]  And people trust in him.
[01:41:48.419 --> 01:41:51.379]  And so that's why it's not a big distraction to me, Alex.
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:54.540]  And, you know... Well, I haven't even... Look, sir.
[01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:56.221]  I'm going to stop you right there, Paul.
[01:41:56.721 --> 01:41:57.101]  Okay?
[01:41:58.761 --> 01:42:00.502]  I don't even know who you are.
[01:42:00.562 --> 01:42:01.962]  You're a caller to the show.
[01:42:02.062 --> 01:42:06.023]  You got mad because I said, send me some links...
[01:42:06.764 --> 01:42:18.456]  For people you want me to interview about the debate if we ever went to the moon, and then I mention, you know, they even made a Hollywood movie about that, Capricorn One, and you say, stop twisting it.
[01:42:19.277 --> 01:42:21.079]  Ooh, you're on to something chilling here.
[01:42:21.119 --> 01:42:26.385]  I mean, I'm just up here talking, and people need to send me links to who they want me to interview.
[01:42:26.465 --> 01:42:27.466]  I said, I think it's interesting.
[01:42:27.506 --> 01:42:28.247]  I'll talk about it.
[01:42:28.817 --> 01:42:37.103]  And then you're off to the races about, last time you called, about charlatans and conspiracies and all this, and then you try to plug your website.
[01:42:37.143 --> 01:42:43.547]  I'm not going to have somebody who just thinks this show belongs to them, and they're going to call up and plug their website, and they're going to gripe at me and think I'm bad.
[01:42:43.847 --> 01:42:44.888]  I know I'm not bad.
[01:42:45.048 --> 01:42:45.869]  I know I'm good.
[01:42:45.889 --> 01:42:47.530]  I know I try the best I can.
[01:42:47.670 --> 01:42:48.651]  I know I'm the real deal.
[01:42:49.211 --> 01:42:53.094]  And so you've got your First Amendment here, and are we talking about the National Draft?
[01:42:53.154 --> 01:42:56.617]  Are we talking about the UN coming in to control our elections and monitor them?
[01:42:56.917 --> 01:42:57.117]  No.
[01:42:57.378 --> 01:42:59.119]  We're now talking about me and you.
[01:42:59.199 --> 01:43:05.224]  And maybe at some ego level, it's fun and great, and I didn't censor your call, but it's really annoying to me.
[01:43:06.145 --> 01:43:10.808]  Now, sir, Paul, if you've got somebody you want me to interview, send it over and I'll consider it.
[01:43:10.868 --> 01:43:11.509]  Thanks for the call.
[01:43:12.290 --> 01:43:15.432]  Okay, and you call and say, I want to debate you, you know, you...
[01:43:17.530 --> 01:43:18.651]  It's just crazy.
[01:43:19.932 --> 01:43:23.274]  I've had bad luck with listener calls.
[01:43:23.354 --> 01:43:27.317]  Once they debate me, I debate them, and then they get weird, and things are getting weirder and weirder.
[01:43:27.337 --> 01:43:29.439]  It's just not about me, sir.
[01:43:29.459 --> 01:43:31.620]  I mean, it's about the information.
[01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:33.201]  So there's your one call for the week.
[01:43:33.622 --> 01:43:34.522]  We didn't censor you.
[01:43:34.983 --> 01:43:37.164]  I'm sure you'll call back first caller next Monday.
[01:43:37.184 --> 01:43:38.525]  I'll see you in seven days.
[01:43:39.266 --> 01:43:40.547]  Okay, let's go ahead and...
[01:43:42.105 --> 01:43:43.025]  Take another call here.
[01:43:43.065 --> 01:43:44.646]  I've got really serious news to cover, folks.
[01:43:45.106 --> 01:43:46.246]  Malta in Denmark.
[01:43:46.346 --> 01:43:47.306]  Malta, you're on the air.
[01:43:47.366 --> 01:43:47.706]  Welcome.
[01:43:47.726 --> 01:43:48.406]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[01:43:48.806 --> 01:43:49.087]  Hello.
[01:43:49.467 --> 01:43:53.107]  I wanted to comment something about this speaker guest you have.
[01:43:54.108 --> 01:43:56.208]  That's the last guy, Justin Rude.
[01:43:56.608 --> 01:44:05.670]  This commercial maritime law, there's a guy named Jordan Maxwell and Rick Varabirian.
[01:44:05.970 --> 01:44:06.690]  Have you heard about them?
[01:44:07.411 --> 01:44:07.711]  Oh, yes.
[01:44:07.751 --> 01:44:09.171]  Talk about this commercial cult.
[01:44:10.057 --> 01:44:14.821]  Well, it's real, but then some of the people, not Maxwell, but some of the others put out this info on it.
[01:44:15.161 --> 01:44:15.782]  Look, it's simple.
[01:44:15.842 --> 01:44:16.903]  It's Admiralty Law.
[01:44:16.923 --> 01:44:18.144]  They're declaring martial law.
[01:44:18.164 --> 01:44:18.604]  Yeah, I know that.
[01:44:18.624 --> 01:44:20.105]  The government will, just for those who don't know.
[01:44:20.365 --> 01:44:21.206]  I know you know that.
[01:44:21.326 --> 01:44:23.548]  I know you know that, Moulton, but for those that don't know, let's tell them.
[01:44:23.948 --> 01:44:24.328]  Okay.
[01:44:24.388 --> 01:44:25.449]  Okay, you tell them what it is.
[01:44:25.489 --> 01:44:25.770]  Go ahead.
[01:44:26.170 --> 01:44:33.756]  Yeah, it's something, it's really saying that we are slaves of the British royal family, something like that.
[01:44:33.936 --> 01:44:34.977]  Well, this is how it works.
[01:44:35.955 --> 01:44:49.941]  Even in America, where we have freedom of the Bill of Rights, when you are a soldier or sailor or airman, you sign a contract of indentured servitude when you're on the military reservation, whether it be an army base or an aircraft carrier in the Red Sea.
[01:44:51.122 --> 01:44:53.963]  Once you do that, you don't have any rights.
[01:44:54.103 --> 01:45:02.207]  And so all they've done is simultaneously set up admiralty courts, which they call uniform commercial courts or...
[01:45:03.027 --> 01:45:08.870]  They have all these different terms for them, and here's an example.
[01:45:09.050 --> 01:45:22.397]  The Campo Board of Central Texas signed over all authority of Austin, Williamson County, Hayes County, Travis County, all our authority over to an unelected private state body.
[01:45:23.167 --> 01:45:25.189]  That serves the pleasure of the bankers.
[01:45:25.409 --> 01:45:26.550]  And it's even in the newspaper.
[01:45:26.990 --> 01:45:30.253]  Austin now has no authority, even over city streets, over nothing.
[01:45:31.073 --> 01:45:32.655]  Now it's not going to be nine toll roads.
[01:45:32.695 --> 01:45:34.436]  Now they're saying 15, maybe 20.
[01:45:34.896 --> 01:45:37.278]  Checkpoints, transponders in all our cars.
[01:45:37.638 --> 01:45:39.840]  It'll raise a couple billion dollars every few years.
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:41.241]  Just total tyranny.
[01:45:41.461 --> 01:45:43.403]  And that is being done.
[01:45:44.406 --> 01:45:46.047]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:45:46.067 --> 01:45:48.408]  But starting back in 1868, the same day they passed the law,
[01:46:13.607 --> 01:46:17.228]  For having black people have rights and right to vote.
[01:46:17.528 --> 01:46:19.688]  But they really didn't have rights.
[01:46:20.008 --> 01:46:26.170]  What they really did is they made them indentured servants or wards of the state under that amendment.
[01:46:26.830 --> 01:46:36.472]  And so instead of saying you're a free human being who has the Bill of Rights, no, now all Americans have this special designation.
[01:46:36.732 --> 01:46:37.232]  Good points.
[01:46:37.312 --> 01:46:38.412]  Good to hear from you, Malta.
[01:46:40.138 --> 01:46:41.960]  What is the term I'm trying to use?
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:46.764]  Because I've seen in federal courts where they even say admiralty law, maritime jurisdiction.
[01:46:47.504 --> 01:46:52.328]  Now they've even set up federal agencies under those names that are going to run your internal passport.
[01:46:53.389 --> 01:46:55.851]  But the other term, it's driving me crazy.
[01:46:55.871 --> 01:46:59.114]  You know when you've got something on the tip of your tongue?
[01:46:59.895 --> 01:47:01.096]  This is what runs everything.
[01:47:01.216 --> 01:47:02.377]  Administrative law courts.
[01:47:03.055 --> 01:47:05.496]  Okay, that administer the Uniform Commercial Code.
[01:47:05.836 --> 01:47:07.156]  There's no jury, folks.
[01:47:07.756 --> 01:47:10.957]  Oh, we're taking your house, and we're not going to pay you for it.
[01:47:11.277 --> 01:47:12.157]  Just compensation.
[01:47:12.177 --> 01:47:13.137]  We're going to build a golf course.
[01:47:13.977 --> 01:47:14.658]  Well, don't worry.
[01:47:14.678 --> 01:47:22.459]  You can go before the Uniform Commercial Code court, and you can have it done there.
[01:47:22.499 --> 01:47:24.640]  No, you get nothing, and you're going to like it.
[01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:28.761]  One more call, and I'm going to come back and get to this national draft situation.
[01:47:29.501 --> 01:47:30.741]  Dan in Texas, go ahead.
[01:47:31.431 --> 01:47:38.773]  Alex, very quickly, I caught Tommy Franks on the Diane Rains show this morning.
[01:47:39.033 --> 01:47:39.333]  Yes.
[01:47:40.053 --> 01:47:43.834]  And a caller asked him this very specific question.
[01:47:44.734 --> 01:47:57.037]  Prior to March 20th, 2003, when we invaded Iraq, had he ever heard or was he familiar with the Project for the New American Century?
[01:47:59.764 --> 01:48:03.347]  Of course, he specifically mentioned Wolfowitz and Crystal.
[01:48:04.608 --> 01:48:11.254]  Tommy Franks answered that yes, he of course heard the names of Wolfowitz and Crystal.
[01:48:12.355 --> 01:48:15.177]  I'd say so, the Deputy Secretary of Defense.
[01:48:15.618 --> 01:48:17.739]  Well, but here's the thing, Alex.
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:18.980]  I'm sorry.
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:25.266]  He then expressly denied ever having heard
[01:48:26.262 --> 01:48:27.824]  Hey, what show is this?
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:39.721]  And that was this morning on her show.
[01:48:39.881 --> 01:48:42.402]  I guarantee you they're going to post that on NPR.
[01:48:42.462 --> 01:48:52.025]  We'll post it, email it to tipsandinfowars.com or the Prison Planet email address, and we'll get that posted and play a clip of that.
[01:48:52.105 --> 01:48:54.006]  But you know what, sir?
[01:48:54.106 --> 01:48:58.207]  I've got to cover this draft article, but will you hold... I just wanted to pass that on.
[01:48:58.247 --> 01:48:59.648]  No, no, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[01:48:59.668 --> 01:49:02.309]  Will you hold ten minutes until we get to the next hour?
[01:49:02.769 --> 01:49:03.189]  Sure will.
[01:49:03.229 --> 01:49:05.410]  Because I want to hear more from you on this.
[01:49:05.430 --> 01:49:06.050]  Okay.
[01:49:07.446 --> 01:49:07.846]  Thank you.
[01:49:08.626 --> 01:49:18.488]  Folks, that's like saying you've never... Let's say you're a VP at ExxonMobil, and it's like saying you've never heard of the CEO.
[01:49:19.569 --> 01:49:29.271]  I mean, we've got Wolfowitz, we've got Pearl, we've got Jeb Bush, George Bush, Dick Cheney, personal buddies with Franks, even before they got into office.
[01:49:30.671 --> 01:49:32.011]  It's been all over the news.
[01:49:32.451 --> 01:49:35.392]  They wrote the strategies, they run the Pentagon...
[01:49:36.158 --> 01:49:37.819]  And Franks has never heard of them.
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:40.781]  Unbelievable.
[01:49:40.801 --> 01:49:41.641]  But it's not unbelievable.
[01:49:42.482 --> 01:49:44.223]  You know, there is no plan for a national draft.
[01:49:44.243 --> 01:49:45.163]  There's just 12 bills.
[01:49:45.924 --> 01:49:46.984]  There is no Patriot Act, too.
[01:49:47.004 --> 01:49:48.045]  They're just trying to pass it.
[01:49:48.705 --> 01:49:49.286]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:49.306 --> 01:49:49.686]  Stay with us.
[01:49:49.706 --> 01:49:51.067]  This is prisonplanet.tv.
[01:49:52.187 --> 01:49:56.530]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:56.710 --> 01:50:00.452]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the new world.
[01:50:04.241 --> 01:50:13.052]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:13.112 --> 01:50:20.040]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:22.183]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:22.423 --> 01:50:32.968]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:33.148 --> 01:50:38.551]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Take Three, is for you.

[01:50:51.437 --> 01:50:59.680]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:04.301]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:04.602 --> 01:51:13.505]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:13.705 --> 01:51:17.326]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:51:17.626 --> 01:51:22.648]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:22.948 --> 01:51:29.691]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:51:30.172 --> 01:51:30.712]  What about you?
[01:51:31.388 --> 01:51:32.108]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.

[01:52:58.035 --> 01:52:59.936]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:53:00.416 --> 01:53:03.257]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:03.818 --> 01:53:09.560]  By the way, we have this author from American Free Press joining us tomorrow.
[01:53:10.601 --> 01:53:11.981]  Draft riots feared.
[01:53:12.061 --> 01:53:14.702]  No matter who wins in November, draft will return.
[01:53:15.823 --> 01:53:19.725]  They're batting about 100% in American Free Press right now.
[01:53:20.105 --> 01:53:22.946]  Regardless of the outcome of next November's presidential election,
[01:53:23.729 --> 01:53:31.854]  The federal government will initiate a military draft in 2005 unless there is a dramatic slackening in the need for U.S.
[01:53:31.894 --> 01:53:35.677]  troops for an ongoing war in Iraq and for peacekeeping duties around the world.
[01:53:36.257 --> 01:53:44.982]  Last June, the Senate overwhelmingly passed a bill to increase the size of the Army by 20,000 persons, and a month earlier, the House voted to add 30,000 soldiers and 9,000 Marines.
[01:53:45.043 --> 01:53:45.763]  Now carries another 40,000.
[01:53:49.418 --> 01:53:50.659]  And current trends continue.
[01:53:50.699 --> 01:53:56.663]  Several military experts have told American Free Press voluntary enlistments will not even dip the number of troops America will need.
[01:53:57.103 --> 01:54:00.685]  That's why 20% in Iraq are illegal aliens from Mexico, folks.
[01:54:01.166 --> 01:54:02.006]  They won't even be enough.
[01:54:02.486 --> 01:54:16.095]  For its global over-commitments, what is going to happen in late August, the Republican National Convention in New York City may well see a precursor to what will take place when the nation starts drafting young men, and perhaps even women.
[01:54:16.415 --> 01:54:17.116]  That's NS-89, by the way.
[01:54:18.317 --> 01:54:18.998]  Into the military.
[01:54:19.158 --> 01:54:37.073]  It is expected that hundreds of thousands of demonstrators will converge upon New York to protest Bush administration's involvement in Iraq, a situation that may become similar to what happened in Chicago in 1968 when the Vietnam War and the selection of Vice President Hubert Humphrey for the presidency of the Democratic Convention there sparked massive protests that turned violent.
[01:54:37.813 --> 01:54:42.297]  There are already signs that there will be massive demonstrations against the Bush administration's war.
[01:54:43.058 --> 01:54:44.559]  By the way, I may be going, by the way.
[01:54:45.365 --> 01:54:46.766]  I must go to something like this.
[01:54:47.067 --> 01:54:49.649]  This level of danger gets me all excited.
[01:54:50.030 --> 01:55:01.181]  There are already signs that there will be a mass of demonstrations against the Bush administration's war in Iraq and the New York Convention, and with the possibility of terrorist attacks, a major consideration.
[01:55:01.261 --> 01:55:07.487]  Federal, state, and local police officials are clearly concerned that the massive demonstrations they expect may turn very ugly.
[01:55:07.507 --> 01:55:09.149]  Yeah, their provocateurs try something.
[01:55:10.413 --> 01:55:21.401]  When the federal government initiates a draft to meet its military manpower needs, which it no longer can do under an all-voluntary system, something the Pentagon clearly knows, there will be an outpouring of public sentiment against it.
[01:55:21.862 --> 01:55:36.433]  Drafting means that the government programmed to constrict young women and men, and probably women, taking into account the inefficient and unworkable unisex military is likely to cause a flap that will dwarf the Vietnam War protest.
[01:55:36.773 --> 01:55:40.295]  That's why they've been gearing up with their Darth Vader outfits beforehand in federal training.
[01:55:40.715 --> 01:55:44.858]  And may equal the Civil War era draft riots in New York and Ferocities.
[01:55:44.998 --> 01:55:47.639]  Those riots required military force to control.
[01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:51.922]  Already campus protesters are warming up to fight the coming draft.
[01:55:53.087 --> 01:56:04.094]  As an example, a recent article in the Daily Texan, a student newspaper of the University of Texas, President Bush's home state compared the draft to slavery because someone else owns your body and mind.
[01:56:04.334 --> 01:56:08.617]  Actually, the Pentagon has already instituted sort of a draft called Stop Loss Orders.
[01:56:10.198 --> 01:56:19.724]  It has blocked the retirement of 40,000 soldiers, many of the National Guard and Reserves, both of which have been drawn down to dangerous levels by expanded deployments, which has...
[01:56:21.119 --> 01:56:24.720]  ...wrecked the recruitment process to produce the needed manpower.
[01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:36.644]  The Pentagon currently has in place a recruitment program to find 11,000 volunteers to reactivate 2,000 local draft boards around the nation, which should make it obvious that there is a draft looming just down the road.
[01:56:36.684 --> 01:56:37.624]  They've introduced the bills!
[01:56:38.844 --> 01:56:44.886]  Neither President Bush nor the Democratic nominee, Senator John Kerry, is likely to bring the matter up until after the presidential election.
[01:56:45.466 --> 01:56:48.327]  That would, they realize, be political no-brainer.
[01:56:50.245 --> 01:56:59.949]  And I would just add, the Daily Texan also reported in the Wall Street Journal that we have secret military troops in suits marching around threatening people at UT that are politically active.
[01:57:00.830 --> 01:57:07.533]  And then we just talked to people in Alabama who were out searching small children on street corners in their military uniforms, training us how to be slaves.
[01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:15.368]  And that's why, five, six, seven years ago, they started issuing the Darth Vader outfits, the riot vehicles, the Humvees, the microwave guns.
[01:57:16.029 --> 01:57:18.451]  All of this, see, they've taken your right to vote.
[01:57:18.532 --> 01:57:20.033]  Most areas CIA run now.
[01:57:20.374 --> 01:57:25.019]  But you can still protest and boycott and rally, and so they're ready to crack down on that.
[01:57:26.351 --> 01:57:28.452]  We've got to stop the provocateurs.
[01:57:28.912 --> 01:57:32.254]  We've got to expose who's behind the violence, the government.
[01:57:32.754 --> 01:57:35.295]  Just like we do, we have to expose who's behind the terrorism.
[01:57:35.696 --> 01:57:37.056]  That is so integral.
[01:57:37.617 --> 01:57:41.378]  And we've got to face the horror of this and have courage.
[01:57:41.398 --> 01:57:49.562]  We'll be back with a third hour.
[01:57:49.763 --> 01:57:50.363]  Big Brother
[01:57:51.065 --> 01:57:52.106]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.827 --> 01:57:53.948]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.589 --> 01:57:55.410]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.171 --> 01:57:57.032]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.732 --> 01:58:01.416]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.917 --> 01:58:06.061]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.142 --> 01:58:10.566]  All right, I really butchered that speed read of...
[01:58:12.316 --> 01:58:13.837]  Draft riots feared.
[01:58:13.937 --> 01:58:18.759]  No matter who wins in November, draft will return for American Free Press.
[01:58:18.819 --> 01:58:21.200]  We should elaborate on this, expand on it.
[01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:23.601]  I hope that you, the listeners, want to talk about it.
[01:58:23.621 --> 01:58:27.903]  We're about to go to your calls for the rest of this hour, interspersed with key news items.
[01:58:28.543 --> 01:58:37.047]  Of course, I wrote the headline in my comment above the CNN article we posted on InfoWars.com, Satan to Monitor Lucifer.
[01:58:38.206 --> 01:58:42.007]  Again, Satan to monitor Lucifer, UN body to monitor U.S.
[01:58:42.087 --> 01:58:42.667]  elections.
[01:58:43.307 --> 01:58:46.627]  Here's a perfect example of the controlled left-right paradigm.
[01:58:46.667 --> 01:58:52.849]  Everybody knows that our elections are a fraud, so they send in the United Nations to, quote, save us.
[01:58:53.389 --> 01:58:59.910]  This promotes the UN as a global government authority and will give the phony conservatives something to act anti-UN about.
[01:59:02.410 --> 01:59:03.990]  When it's Bush that brought them in to begin with.
[01:59:05.691 --> 01:59:06.631]  Just ridiculous.
[01:59:08.146 --> 01:59:09.506]  And there's just so much other news.
[01:59:09.666 --> 01:59:15.368]  Fake beheading videos and just... But right now, let's go back to Dan in Texas.
[01:59:15.428 --> 01:59:18.148]  We had to cut him short in the last hour, so I brought him back up.
[01:59:18.889 --> 01:59:31.372]  He was listening to NPR, the Diana Rain show, and Tommy Franks, who's making the rounds in a systematic military fashion on TV and radio and in the newspapers...
[01:59:32.822 --> 01:59:34.383]  That's what I told listeners last week.
[01:59:34.443 --> 01:59:41.425]  I said, you ought to call this guy when he's on C-SPAN or something and say, what do you mean Bush never had a plan to go into Iraq?
[01:59:41.465 --> 01:59:48.548]  His own PNAC documents advised the Pentagon to prepare for it, and they said they were going to go into Iraq and that Saddam wasn't a threat.
[01:59:49.088 --> 01:59:52.650]  Well, Dan says he heard Frank get confronted by a caller about this.
[01:59:54.230 --> 01:59:56.071]  This is made up of all of his bosses.
[01:59:57.021 --> 01:59:58.101]  And their whole agenda.
[01:59:58.141 --> 02:00:06.944]  He said he never heard of the Project for a New American Century, even though he was a favorite of them, and I believe been to some of their meetings, by the way.
[02:00:08.324 --> 02:00:11.525]  But go ahead and tell us more about it, Dan.
[02:00:12.226 --> 02:00:14.366]  Well, that's basically it, Alex.
[02:00:14.506 --> 02:00:23.969]  He was asked, in his service as CENTCOM commander, up to the invasion of Iraq,
[02:00:25.930 --> 02:00:29.293]  Had he ever heard of, was he familiar with Phoenix?
[02:00:30.253 --> 02:00:35.097]  And the caller specifically mentioned the two names of Paul Wolfowitz and William Crystal.
[02:00:35.958 --> 02:00:47.768]  And he admitted, of course, that he was familiar with Paul Wolfowitz and William Crystal's names, and that Paul Wolfowitz was obviously Assistant Secretary of Defense.
[02:00:48.448 --> 02:00:52.812]  But then he very expressly denied
[02:00:53.860 --> 02:01:05.062]  Having ever heard of FENAC or having any familiarity with its operations prior to the invasion of Iran.
[02:01:06.383 --> 02:01:16.585]  And I'm in no position to refute his expressed denial that he's familiar with FENAC prior to the invasion.
[02:01:17.205 --> 02:01:19.505]  But I find it incredibly difficult to believe.
[02:01:20.885 --> 02:01:21.886]  Well, exactly.
[02:01:21.986 --> 02:01:23.466]  I mean, your gut tells you
[02:01:25.006 --> 02:01:33.993]  That, you know, it's like when you see a homeless person with tracks all over their arms and bruises all over them, begging for money with a desperate look in their eye.
[02:01:34.013 --> 02:01:35.474]  You can tell they're injecting heroin.
[02:01:36.574 --> 02:01:52.205]  And, you know, looking at Franks, whose bosses were all members of this preeminent group that took over the Pentagon and has been there for 25 years, and it's been all over the news about the prior knowledge, and he's out there stomping, saying, Oh, no, we never planned to go into Iraq.
[02:01:52.285 --> 02:01:53.466]  Oh, no, we never said that.
[02:01:54.372 --> 02:01:55.533]  And you know what?
[02:01:55.673 --> 02:02:04.200]  Clark and others have all been on record about being in meetings, and I believe Frank was in those, talking about the plans to go into Iraq.
[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:09.925]  Well, I know his statement about no plans to go into Iraq on Fox.
[02:02:10.065 --> 02:02:11.166]  I know that's a lie.
[02:02:11.767 --> 02:02:17.211]  Well, when you look at the list of those PNAC members that...
[02:02:18.820 --> 02:02:23.922]  Sent the letter to President Clinton in 1998 asking him to invade Iraq.
[02:02:24.062 --> 02:02:24.342]  Yes.
[02:02:24.762 --> 02:02:39.028]  And you look at all the names on that list, including Dick Cheney, and then for this CENTCOM commander to expressly deny that he had any familiarity with that organization.
[02:02:40.028 --> 02:02:40.588]  Incredible.
[02:02:40.928 --> 02:02:41.228]  It is.
[02:02:41.308 --> 02:02:41.949]  Thanks for the call.
[02:02:41.969 --> 02:02:42.829]  More calls coming up.
[02:02:46.852 --> 02:02:52.314]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:52.754 --> 02:02:56.975]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:02:57.215 --> 02:03:04.257]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:04.617 --> 02:03:10.739]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:10.879 --> 02:03:12.079]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:12.299 --> 02:03:12.820]  We're good to go.

[02:04:50.991 --> 02:04:52.351]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:04:52.551 --> 02:04:54.771]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:04:54.911 --> 02:04:57.012]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:04:57.272 --> 02:05:02.213]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.

[02:05:06.834 --> 02:05:08.595]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:05:08.675 --> 02:05:19.342]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and buyable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:05:19.482 --> 02:05:21.383]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:05:52.923 --> 02:05:54.024]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.044 --> 02:05:55.505]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.265 --> 02:05:57.046]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.817 --> 02:06:01.758]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.978 --> 02:06:06.099]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:11.080 --> 02:06:14.440]  All right, Melissa in Florida, sunny state over there.
[02:06:15.221 --> 02:06:16.261]  Welcome to the Airwaves.
[02:06:16.321 --> 02:06:17.141]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:06:17.561 --> 02:06:18.381]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:06:18.541 --> 02:06:18.841]  You bet.
[02:06:19.341 --> 02:06:27.103]  First of all, I wanted to ask you if you got the two tapes I mailed you, which you should have gotten on around Friday the 30th of July.
[02:06:28.185 --> 02:06:29.267]  I get a lot of videos.
[02:06:29.307 --> 02:06:30.168]  What do they pertain to?
[02:06:30.188 --> 02:06:33.691]  It was the Khalil bin Laden footage that you had asked me for.
[02:06:33.731 --> 02:06:34.352]  Oh, yes.
[02:06:34.532 --> 02:06:45.163]  When they tried to do a bait-and-switch, they admit the government flew a bunch of Saudis and bin Ladens out on the 13th, 14th, 15th when all air traffic was grounded.
[02:06:45.203 --> 02:06:46.745]  But then they tried to do a bait-and-switch,
[02:06:47.325 --> 02:06:48.506]  And go, oh, wait a minute.
[02:06:49.006 --> 02:06:52.387]  Some other Bin Ladens flew out on the 18th, and they were screened.
[02:06:52.407 --> 02:06:54.288]  And then, oh, look, they were screened.
[02:06:54.909 --> 02:06:56.629]  Yes, I did get that, and thanks a million.
[02:06:56.969 --> 02:06:57.530]  I'm glad.
[02:06:57.610 --> 02:06:57.970]  Okay.
[02:06:58.450 --> 02:07:08.815]  And then I wanted to let you know that General Tommy Franks was also on the Hannity radio show for an hour, and I emailed you that just after midnight.
[02:07:09.543 --> 02:07:11.664]  And what was he on there saying?
[02:07:12.164 --> 02:07:16.525]  He was saying the same thing about his premonition about 9-11.
[02:07:16.545 --> 02:07:20.507]  The towers falling into each other, but no one knew.
[02:07:20.567 --> 02:07:28.429]  The CIA was just running a drill that morning of lying hijacked jets into it, and just so happened to use that drill to order NORAD to stand down, but it's all accidental.
[02:07:29.409 --> 02:07:37.852]  Yeah, and he talked about, like, what's worse than war would be five 9-11s, and that his biggest fear would be that
[02:07:38.496 --> 02:07:45.721]  You know, the police would be militarized after 9-11, but it didn't happen, and he was so happy about that.
[02:07:46.221 --> 02:07:52.405]  But then he added to that, at least from the Fox clip we played and his news articles that he's written, interviews he's done,
[02:07:53.331 --> 02:07:54.472]  It's basically this.
[02:07:54.652 --> 02:07:59.433]  I'm real sad, but the people to be safe after a big attack may demand this.
[02:07:59.553 --> 02:08:03.955]  Boy, shucks, it's too bad, but martial law makes them safe.
[02:08:05.356 --> 02:08:08.377]  You can't expect them to come out and go, martial law is good, I'm a general.
[02:08:08.417 --> 02:08:12.558]  It's real sad they're going to want this for safety, that it gives them safety.
[02:08:12.859 --> 02:08:14.719]  See how they're using reverse psychology?
[02:08:15.079 --> 02:08:19.101]  He said the exact same thing on this show, and I sent you the audio of it.
[02:08:19.281 --> 02:08:21.882]  He said that the people would demand it.
[02:08:23.362 --> 02:08:25.403]  That we have martial law, et cetera.
[02:08:25.443 --> 02:08:26.483]  To make them safe.
[02:08:26.643 --> 02:08:26.923]  Wow.
[02:08:27.723 --> 02:08:30.624]  And I also wanted to tell you that Robert Kennedy, Jr.
[02:08:30.704 --> 02:08:34.886]  was on Hannity last Monday, and I sent you that transcript, too.
[02:08:35.666 --> 02:08:44.369]  And he talks about, well, of course he's a Democrat, but he talks about the Bush administration basically learning well from the Nazis.
[02:08:45.069 --> 02:08:47.069]  And I have some quotes written down that he said.
[02:08:50.279 --> 02:08:57.586]  And again, Democrats hear that and think, oh, our party must be good, they're telling the truth, but then they give full solutions like, let's have the U.N.
[02:08:57.666 --> 02:08:59.107]  come monitor our elections.
[02:09:00.508 --> 02:09:05.032]  Which sets it up as the world government body, the authority, and Bush is bringing the U.N.
[02:09:05.152 --> 02:09:10.898]  in, they're not even allowed to survey anything, it's just in name only to prepare us to accept this.
[02:09:12.859 --> 02:09:14.000]  What do you think of the U.N.
[02:09:14.060 --> 02:09:15.622]  coming in to monitor the elections?
[02:09:16.164 --> 02:09:20.127]  Well, I totally am against that, of course, because I know how the U.N.
[02:09:20.147 --> 02:09:29.135]  really is and how they're known to go around the world killing children and people, and they're just trying to take over the world, basically.
[02:09:29.155 --> 02:09:31.076]  Well, this is exactly, but this is what I've said.
[02:09:31.757 --> 02:09:45.688]  Why can't we have what Congressman Rush Holt wants and what the American people want en masse and what's constitutional to have a paper ballot, even if they're going to keep the electronic machines in, which they shouldn't, which have been proven to be a deliberate fraud coast-to-coast,
[02:09:47.398 --> 02:09:55.465]  But even if it's accidental, they admit, it's cheating everybody coast to coast, and their own engineers have gone public and said it's all a fraud.
[02:09:55.506 --> 02:10:08.037]  But why is the League of Women Voters, why are the Democrats, why are the Republicans lobbying, that is the power elite, those in high positions, to not have there be a paper ballot printed out that goes in a box saying,
[02:10:08.337 --> 02:10:11.778]  To show a record to be meshed against the electronic numbers.
[02:10:11.918 --> 02:10:12.198]  Why?
[02:10:12.478 --> 02:10:13.878]  Why can't we just have that?
[02:10:14.199 --> 02:10:17.899]  Why can't we just have machines that can be audited properly?
[02:10:18.159 --> 02:10:26.341]  Oh, but don't worry, the UN is coming, but it says they can't be within 50 feet of the front door of the polling place and are not allowed to talk to anyone.
[02:10:26.422 --> 02:10:32.343]  So, again, it is just the headline, UN to monitor, to get us used to that.
[02:10:33.356 --> 02:10:54.331]  Well, I sent you probably about an hour of footage also on the whole paper ballot thing, and they were on C-SPAN, and it was some lady that was in charge of it for her state, and she was talking, she got up and showed like a 10-foot long receipt of what a paper ballot would look like if they actually used paper ballots, and she was just
[02:10:54.744 --> 02:10:58.106]  The whole thing was about, there's no way we can do this, it's ridiculous.
[02:10:58.126 --> 02:10:59.367]  Yeah, it's totally ridiculous.
[02:10:59.447 --> 02:11:11.834]  What you do is, is you go in, and you go and you vote, and then a one sheet prints out with what the votes were, that's done in a Scantron bubble sheet format, or they can be hand counted, and I know, I've seen them.
[02:11:12.134 --> 02:11:13.075]  Oh, it's impossible!
[02:11:13.275 --> 02:11:14.696]  How can we have paper ballots?
[02:11:14.716 --> 02:11:15.996]  How can everybody else have them?
[02:11:16.216 --> 02:11:21.459]  How do we send monitors to other countries to go, oh, your system's a fraud, but we just can't have it here, can we?
[02:11:21.700 --> 02:11:22.440]  And we just, it's
[02:11:22.500 --> 02:11:23.581]  We just can't do it.
[02:11:23.781 --> 02:11:26.324]  And how dare you, Melissa, want to have that?
[02:11:26.785 --> 02:11:31.109]  Right, but they can do it for an ATM machine or when you go pump gas and it's no problem.
[02:11:33.132 --> 02:11:39.338]  Look, they're selling us this garbage and now here in Austin we don't have voting anymore and I'm going to be honest about this.
[02:11:39.358 --> 02:11:40.900]  That's why I don't say vote them out.
[02:11:41.300 --> 02:11:42.562]  All you can do is sue them.
[02:11:43.386 --> 02:11:49.590]  Or boycott them or protest against them, and suddenly they're going, we're getting rid of AXS TV whether you like it or not.
[02:11:49.690 --> 02:11:54.533]  We're going to put in 15, 20 toll roads, not just nine on all your existing roads.
[02:11:54.553 --> 02:11:56.074]  You won't be able to come in the city without doing it.
[02:11:56.534 --> 02:11:58.415]  We're going to put a tracker chip in all your cars.
[02:11:58.756 --> 02:12:00.657]  We're going to take your property without paying for it.
[02:12:00.897 --> 02:12:03.138]  Hey, we've got men with black ski masks and machine guns.
[02:12:03.459 --> 02:12:05.500]  And you go, hey, I'm going to vote against you.
[02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:06.781]  They just laugh at you now.
[02:12:06.821 --> 02:12:07.661]  They go, you are?
[02:12:07.961 --> 02:12:08.802]  You're going to get me?
[02:12:09.062 --> 02:12:10.443]  Okay, you go try to do that.
[02:12:11.181 --> 02:12:19.423]  You know, the poll says 98% of Austinites, literally, liberals and conservatives are all against the toll roads, but they don't care.
[02:12:20.564 --> 02:12:22.384]  It's part of the new freedom.
[02:12:23.405 --> 02:12:24.385]  Thanks for the call, Melissa.
[02:12:24.405 --> 02:12:24.985]  You keep it up.
[02:12:26.106 --> 02:12:27.506]  Robert in California.
[02:12:27.566 --> 02:12:28.266]  Robert, go ahead.
[02:12:28.286 --> 02:12:29.567]  Hi, Alex.
[02:12:30.287 --> 02:12:30.867]  Hello, sir.
[02:12:30.907 --> 02:12:33.108]  The great west coast out here of the unwashed.
[02:12:33.628 --> 02:12:34.288]  Good to talk to you.
[02:12:34.898 --> 02:12:46.484]  I was just watching the news and realizing that every time that Bush wants more money, they just call the terrorists and say, we need to threaten the oil, so now this morning they shut down oil production to raise our oil prices even more.
[02:12:46.764 --> 02:12:47.344]  That's right.
[02:12:47.385 --> 02:12:51.086]  They make billions of dollars just in a few weeks every time a pipeline gets blown up.
[02:12:51.206 --> 02:12:52.247]  Oh, we have to gouge you.
[02:12:52.567 --> 02:12:54.088]  Oh, we're all making record profits.
[02:12:54.688 --> 02:12:57.830]  Oh, there's going to be a new terror alert because we're about to announce a new agency.
[02:12:57.850 --> 02:13:01.732]  I thought we had a federal government to protect us
[02:13:02.236 --> 02:13:07.319]  To keep our rights, not to every single twitch a terrorist makes to take away our rights.
[02:13:08.360 --> 02:13:12.263]  Every day I have to scream at all my friends who all say, you're crazy, you're crazy, this is not happening.
[02:13:12.283 --> 02:13:14.704]  Well, government in history, your friends are right.
[02:13:14.784 --> 02:13:16.785]  Government's never been bad, it's only good.
[02:13:17.126 --> 02:13:19.067]  We should just submit to power and control.
[02:13:19.627 --> 02:13:24.270]  Anybody who disagrees with total control and government supremacy has a problem.
[02:13:25.571 --> 02:13:28.173]  I have to look over my shoulder, literally, when I'm out in public now.
[02:13:28.621 --> 02:13:40.128]  I mean, I was out having a burrito yesterday, and some security officer stopped and looked right in my face because I was telling my girlfriend that, you know, this election has been all set up, we're all being set up to go down, and this guy's like, what are you talking about?
[02:13:40.148 --> 02:13:41.348]  I couldn't believe it.
[02:13:42.809 --> 02:13:44.730]  Actually walked over and asked me what I was talking about.
[02:13:46.051 --> 02:13:47.132]  Well, what did you say to him?
[02:13:47.152 --> 02:13:48.673]  I said, I'm talking about 9-1-1.
[02:13:48.773 --> 02:13:49.753]  Have you ever heard of it?
[02:13:49.793 --> 02:13:51.294]  It was this inside job.
[02:13:52.555 --> 02:13:53.295]  He just walked away.
[02:13:53.355 --> 02:13:54.436]  He said, mm-hmm, okay.
[02:13:55.171 --> 02:13:57.172]  It just freaked me out, basically.
[02:13:57.192 --> 02:14:00.314]  Yeah, he can't wait to get drafted and served domestically.
[02:14:00.334 --> 02:14:03.756]  He just has a certain look in his eye that he don't... Well, there won't be any jobs.
[02:14:03.776 --> 02:14:04.476]  He's a rent-a-cop.
[02:14:04.536 --> 02:14:06.037]  But there won't be any jobs.
[02:14:06.577 --> 02:14:15.883]  So he'll get his $25,000 a year to march around in a little uniform, and he'll have a little taser and a stick and a radio to call the SWAT team, and he'll be running your life.
[02:14:15.923 --> 02:14:17.364]  He's going to have power soon.
[02:14:17.624 --> 02:14:23.407]  Well, that story you talked about, I think it was last week or the week before, about how the government sold a trillion dollars, doesn't have to account for it.
[02:14:24.773 --> 02:14:26.034]  It's a trillion, too.
[02:14:26.054 --> 02:14:29.876]  It's gone from the storyboards all over the country just one day and then gone.
[02:14:29.896 --> 02:14:33.559]  I guess they just get to loot us for a trillion dollars and that's that.
[02:14:34.699 --> 02:14:41.563]  And they get to have billions of dollars of unaccountable money in Iraq and get to hire former bank robbers and criminals to run things.
[02:14:41.643 --> 02:14:42.904]  It's a joke.
[02:14:42.944 --> 02:14:51.989]  They swear to uphold the Constitution that says they're going to establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote general welfare.
[02:14:52.130 --> 02:14:52.710]  Come on!
[02:14:53.444 --> 02:14:55.045]  They do everything but that.
[02:14:55.566 --> 02:14:56.467]  It's incredible.
[02:14:57.027 --> 02:15:00.830]  I tell everybody all day long that this is coming, and they still call me crazy.
[02:15:01.511 --> 02:15:03.032]  Well, that's because they're cowards.
[02:15:03.092 --> 02:15:04.274]  Deep down, they're afraid.
[02:15:04.294 --> 02:15:08.157]  I mean, out here on the West Coast, boy, you just better be going along with the crowd.
[02:15:08.197 --> 02:15:12.781]  I mean, there's so much instantaneous peer pressure to drive you backwards and push you away.
[02:15:12.801 --> 02:15:13.762]  Well, you know, that's true.
[02:15:13.862 --> 02:15:17.145]  In New York, I use jaywalking as an example.
[02:15:17.185 --> 02:15:18.686]  In New York, everybody jaywalks.
[02:15:19.287 --> 02:15:20.688]  Everybody jaywalks in Austin.
[02:15:21.286 --> 02:15:25.750]  But you go to places like Germany, where it's very regimented, where they follow orders.
[02:15:25.790 --> 02:15:28.192]  Or you go to L.A., nobody jaywalks.
[02:15:28.212 --> 02:15:29.132]  People would freak out.
[02:15:29.152 --> 02:15:30.774]  You know, there's no cars anywhere.
[02:15:30.794 --> 02:15:32.495]  You know, the thing's red.
[02:15:32.535 --> 02:15:33.316]  I run across the street.
[02:15:33.336 --> 02:15:35.077]  They're just programmed dummies.
[02:15:35.157 --> 02:15:35.878]  Stop it!
[02:15:35.898 --> 02:15:38.120]  Sir, you're jaywalking!
[02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:43.444]  I mean, right now, Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, is on the air saying yes.
[02:15:43.803 --> 02:15:48.687]  Get ready to keep those 911 and those DNC convention precautions in place.
[02:15:48.748 --> 02:15:51.790]  And from now on, just get used to seeing men on the streets with guns.
[02:15:51.930 --> 02:15:55.854]  Yeah, from Boston to New York to every city they have this, you're right.
[02:15:56.314 --> 02:15:57.315]  The tanks are staying.
[02:15:57.536 --> 02:15:59.497]  Those billions in Homeland Security are staying.
[02:15:59.557 --> 02:16:03.381]  I feel like I'm in Nazi Germany, like when Einstein said, Oop, time to get out.
[02:16:04.625 --> 02:16:09.206]  And I'm like, where can we run to that this false government isn't already in control?
[02:16:09.246 --> 02:16:10.266]  You know, I'm confused, though.
[02:16:10.306 --> 02:16:13.547]  The government can only be good and only do right, and total power is good.
[02:16:13.587 --> 02:16:16.027]  When police start wearing black ski masks, that's always good.
[02:16:16.387 --> 02:16:21.388]  But they did that in Germany, so how can government be God if government's gone wrong before?
[02:16:21.408 --> 02:16:26.329]  I guess, according to Homeland Security, we better just start supporting Hitler.
[02:16:26.829 --> 02:16:31.170]  I heard when I was growing up that there was mass mind control, and I always thought, that's crazy.
[02:16:31.550 --> 02:16:33.190]  People can't be mass mind control.
[02:16:33.857 --> 02:16:37.760]  And then you read MKUltra, and you go, uh-oh, we're in deep trouble.
[02:16:37.940 --> 02:16:43.745]  Well, I appreciate the call, but look, most mind control is just influencer propaganda.
[02:16:44.225 --> 02:16:46.547]  You know, it's lower grades of it, and it's frankly more effective.
[02:16:46.907 --> 02:16:49.990]  You know, it isn't wires in the head and, you know, PCP.
[02:16:50.690 --> 02:16:59.337]  Most mind control is just the social mores given to you by the government.
[02:16:59.637 --> 02:17:00.618]  It's peer pressure.
[02:17:01.439 --> 02:17:02.920]  It's training you how to be a prisoner.
[02:17:03.556 --> 02:17:11.160]  It's having a talking head laugh at someone who has a view on TV, and the average sheeple sees that and then regurgitates that, parrots that.
[02:17:12.901 --> 02:17:15.662]  And good propaganda plays to people's fears.
[02:17:16.182 --> 02:17:26.367]  You think the average person wants to believe we've got criminals running the government to put cancer viruses in the vaccine and carry out attacks and put fluoride in the water that's deadly poison?
[02:17:27.230 --> 02:17:28.191]  I mean, it's admitted fact.
[02:17:28.211 --> 02:17:33.155]  You can go read hundreds of major medical studies by major universities, but the point is they know the average person doesn't read that.
[02:17:33.616 --> 02:17:35.998]  So good propaganda plays to people's fear.
[02:17:36.779 --> 02:17:42.224]  Their rationale, that's not true, to play their own mental mind trick, their own double thing.
[02:17:42.684 --> 02:17:43.705]  Take more calls when we get back.
[02:17:44.565 --> 02:17:46.907]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:17:47.167 --> 02:17:51.010]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:17:51.330 --> 02:17:52.151]  Read the labels.
[02:17:52.571 --> 02:17:56.694]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:17:56.914 --> 02:18:01.117]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:18:01.497 --> 02:18:06.361]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:18:06.741 --> 02:18:10.343]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:18:10.504 --> 02:18:15.847]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:18:16.127 --> 02:18:18.849]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:18:19.149 --> 02:18:20.050]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:18:43.934 --> 02:18:47.197]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:18:47.257 --> 02:18:51.460]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:18:51.700 --> 02:18:54.483]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:18:54.683 --> 02:18:57.085]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:18:57.265 --> 02:19:05.912]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:19:06.112 --> 02:19:07.453]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:19:07.654 --> 02:19:11.817]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path.
[02:19:12.137 --> 02:19:12.898]  We're good to go.
[02:19:41.817 --> 02:19:42.297]  We're good to go.
[02:19:42.317 --> 02:19:45.238]  We're good to go.

[02:20:39.553 --> 02:20:40.915]  You lose nothing but the debt.
[02:20:43.214 --> 02:20:47.115]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:20:47.335 --> 02:20:59.619]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:21:00.039 --> 02:21:00.439]  The U.S.
[02:21:00.479 --> 02:21:06.081]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:21:06.461 --> 02:21:08.682]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:21:10.542 --> 02:21:11.022]  We're good to go.
[02:21:31.392 --> 02:21:32.693]  Folks, I just want to add as a tidbit...
[02:22:02.992 --> 02:22:08.657]  That if you don't hear me something, if you don't hear myself endorsing something, I don't believe in it.
[02:22:09.917 --> 02:22:17.784]  That goes for magic machines that heal you instantly, or you don't owe anybody any money.
[02:22:18.104 --> 02:22:21.787]  I tell everybody out there, check everything out for yourselves and check me out for yourself.
[02:22:24.029 --> 02:22:25.750]  I just have to say that from time to time.
[02:22:26.831 --> 02:22:29.612]  Let's go ahead and take some calls.
[02:22:30.112 --> 02:22:31.532]  I'm going to take five more calls.
[02:22:31.552 --> 02:22:35.693]  We're going to talk to Jackie and Sean and Maureen and Robert and Kara.
[02:22:36.614 --> 02:22:41.115]  That's going to be it because I want to get into the fake beheading and just a bunch of other news that's now come out.
[02:22:42.015 --> 02:22:43.075]  Really important stuff.
[02:22:44.075 --> 02:22:47.616]  Let us go ahead now and talk to Jackie in Texas.
[02:22:47.636 --> 02:22:48.036]  Go ahead.
[02:22:48.777 --> 02:22:49.577]  Hey, Alex.
[02:22:49.697 --> 02:22:50.477]  Thanks so much.
[02:22:51.295 --> 02:22:55.580]  I really appreciate what you and Violet and Stephanie and all of you people are doing.
[02:22:55.940 --> 02:22:58.703]  Well, I want to thank you for being involved and caring, but go ahead.
[02:22:58.943 --> 02:23:01.186]  Well, I've got to tell you something.
[02:23:01.986 --> 02:23:12.678]  I was going through my email this morning, and I saw this headline saying, Outing of Spy Stuns Security Experts, the New Zealand Herald.
[02:23:13.661 --> 02:23:16.204]  Also, in the Christian Science Monitor.
[02:23:16.584 --> 02:23:19.628]  Yeah, all the Israeli spies and their... No, no, no.
[02:23:19.708 --> 02:23:22.110]  This is the one... And they're supplying them to terrorists.
[02:23:22.190 --> 02:23:23.552]  Oh, it's a different New Zealand case.
[02:23:23.672 --> 02:23:23.972]  Oh, yeah.
[02:23:24.032 --> 02:23:25.814]  This is really... This is something.
[02:23:26.555 --> 02:23:33.483]  This Pakistani intelligence deal where they busted Al-Qaeda...
[02:23:34.449 --> 02:23:42.276]  And that was the reason for the latest terrorist... And now they've released a bunch of them because... No, no, no, no, no.
[02:23:42.337 --> 02:23:43.057]  Let me finish.
[02:23:43.077 --> 02:23:43.938]  That was another article.
[02:23:43.978 --> 02:23:44.679]  Okay, I'm confused.
[02:23:44.699 --> 02:23:44.999]  Go ahead.
[02:23:45.099 --> 02:23:45.499]  Okay.
[02:23:46.761 --> 02:23:52.065]  Reuters reported on Saturday that Pakistani intelligence officers said that U.S.
[02:23:52.186 --> 02:23:59.973]  officials blew the cover on an al-Qaeda mole last week when the mole's identity was confirmed to the New York Times.
[02:24:01.352 --> 02:24:06.637]  The Times originally identified the source of their information as senior American officials.
[02:24:07.258 --> 02:24:14.504]  The mole, computer expert Mohammed Naeem Manoor Khan, was arrested secretly in mid-July in Pakistan.
[02:24:15.085 --> 02:24:20.610]  He had agreed to help authorities track down al-Qaeda militants in Britain and the United States.
[02:24:22.818 --> 02:24:24.441]  Well, let me stop you for just a minute.
[02:24:24.841 --> 02:24:28.106]  And no, I have not seen that, but I have seen... I've emailed it to you.
[02:24:28.287 --> 02:24:28.867]  Well, thank you.
[02:24:29.008 --> 02:24:31.552]  I have seen it happen many, many times.
[02:24:32.262 --> 02:24:37.764]  So anyway, a little further down in this article, which I'm sure you'll read,
[02:24:57.987 --> 02:25:06.491]  The whole thing smacks either of incompetence or worse, said Tim Ripley, a security expert who writes the Jane's Defense publication.
[02:25:06.611 --> 02:25:07.492]  That is huge.
[02:25:07.872 --> 02:25:08.512]  It is huge.
[02:25:09.453 --> 02:25:11.594]  And you have to ask, he says.
[02:25:12.133 --> 02:25:19.198]  What are they doing compromising a deep mole within Al-Qaeda when it's so difficult to get these guys in there in the first place?
[02:25:19.218 --> 02:25:28.824]  Well, look, I don't think Dick Cheney blew over 200 CIA officers' covers just over that ambassador saying that Cheney was a liar.
[02:25:29.064 --> 02:25:30.545]  This is part of a bigger plan.
[02:25:30.565 --> 02:25:31.746]  They're undermining our country.
[02:25:32.106 --> 02:25:32.567]  They are.
[02:25:32.787 --> 02:25:33.187]  I know it.
[02:25:33.347 --> 02:25:37.630]  And that gaffe, that supposed gaffe Bush made this past Saturday...
[02:25:38.617 --> 02:25:39.458]  At the Pentagon.
[02:25:39.878 --> 02:25:44.380]  When you go to the White House and you read the speech there, it's in there in the speech.
[02:25:44.720 --> 02:25:45.801]  It's not a transcript.
[02:25:46.001 --> 02:25:47.221]  It's the speech.
[02:25:47.301 --> 02:25:48.182]  It's no gaffe.
[02:25:48.802 --> 02:25:50.743]  You know, where he said that... Excuse me.
[02:25:50.783 --> 02:25:57.366]  You're telling me, because they usually post a speech beforehand, you're telling me it says speech, not transcript, and they left that in?
[02:25:57.726 --> 02:25:58.847]  That's what I saw.
[02:25:59.307 --> 02:26:01.668]  I may be, you know, biased.
[02:26:01.708 --> 02:26:03.109]  Well, I'm starting to think it's on purpose.
[02:26:03.169 --> 02:26:03.989]  Nobody's this stupid.
[02:26:04.753 --> 02:26:09.696]  Nobody says things would be a heck of a lot easier if this was a dictatorship so long as I'm the dictator.
[02:26:09.736 --> 02:26:13.799]  No, I saw that myself because I watched the inauguration.
[02:26:13.959 --> 02:26:14.559]  He came out.
[02:26:14.980 --> 02:26:17.801]  He said that twice.
[02:26:17.961 --> 02:26:18.582]  He said that.
[02:26:18.862 --> 02:26:20.283]  And then claimed it was an accident.
[02:26:20.323 --> 02:26:23.085]  You don't say long sentences like that on accident twice.
[02:26:23.105 --> 02:26:24.486]  No, no, no, no, you don't.
[02:26:25.406 --> 02:26:29.809]  Anyway, it goes against all the rules of counter-espionage, counter-terrorism.
[02:26:30.208 --> 02:26:31.769]  Running agents and so forth.
[02:26:32.089 --> 02:26:38.992]  It's not exactly cloak and dagger undercover work if it's on the front pages every time there's a development, is it?
[02:26:40.112 --> 02:26:41.333]  Anyway, this really...
[02:26:41.912 --> 02:26:43.613]  This is outrageous.
[02:26:43.713 --> 02:26:45.533]  It is.
[02:26:46.014 --> 02:26:54.157]  The BBC reported almost a year before 9-11 that British ambassadors were in Pakistan on the Afghan border and saw bin Laden being guarded by U.S.
[02:26:54.177 --> 02:26:54.977]  Special Forces.
[02:26:55.017 --> 02:26:56.298]  I mean, that's before 9-11.
[02:26:57.398 --> 02:27:02.600]  British witnesses are going, I mean, ambassadors, diplomats are going, I saw bin Laden.
[02:27:02.660 --> 02:27:03.540]  Why haven't they arrested him?
[02:27:03.560 --> 02:27:05.281]  And then suddenly, shut up.
[02:27:05.781 --> 02:27:06.502]  Shut up.
[02:27:08.742 --> 02:27:09.863]  In the New Zealand Herald.
[02:27:10.424 --> 02:27:24.613]  The first sentence is, the revelation that a mole within Al-Qaeda was exposed after Washington launched its orange alert this month has shocked security experts, who say the outing of the source may have set back the war on terror.
[02:27:25.153 --> 02:27:26.414]  I have one more thing I want to tell you.
[02:27:26.454 --> 02:27:29.536]  Well, it sounds to me, sure, it sounds to me like the outing of the source.
[02:27:31.257 --> 02:27:32.157]  Well, we'll talk about one.
[02:27:32.177 --> 02:27:32.498]  Goodbye.
[02:27:34.579 --> 02:27:35.500]  We're on the march.
[02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:37.501]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.468 --> 02:27:41.249]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.290 --> 02:27:48.531]  Ever walk into someone's house and you can tell instantly they own pets?
[02:27:48.892 --> 02:27:53.553]  They've made the mistake of using a pet odor and stain product that only covers the problem temporarily.
[02:27:53.753 --> 02:27:55.274]  We don't have that problem in our home.
[02:27:55.474 --> 02:27:57.875]  We've discovered it's just better to use PAWS.
[02:27:58.115 --> 02:28:04.877]  Pet Accident Wash-Up Solution, or PAWS, is the quickest and safest pet stain and odor eliminator known to man or man's best friends.

[02:28:16.788 --> 02:28:20.091]  It's only a matter of time until Fido or Fluffy has an accident.
[02:28:20.331 --> 02:28:21.512]  Be prepared with Paws.
[02:28:21.832 --> 02:28:25.796]  Use Paws anywhere stains and odors are a problem, like the laundry or the bathroom.
[02:28:26.016 --> 02:28:29.519]  Try Paws once and you'll quickly discover it's just better to use Paws.

[02:29:10.309 --> 02:29:22.075]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[02:29:44.964 --> 02:29:45.945]  It's finally here.
[02:29:46.086 --> 02:29:47.087]  Spring has arrived.
[02:29:47.267 --> 02:29:50.231]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:29:50.451 --> 02:29:53.915]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:29:54.116 --> 02:30:02.246]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the Ark Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[02:30:46.396 --> 02:30:51.520]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:52.200 --> 02:30:54.422]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:56.420 --> 02:31:05.706]  Also, we've got one of the best, if not the best, most informed radio audiences on the planet, if not the best.
[02:31:07.247 --> 02:31:17.773]  And about 95% of the time when a caller calls in about an article or a statement, it's so accurate, I've got to confirm this for myself, but we'll definitely post it on Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:31:17.813 --> 02:31:19.314]  If I miss it, it's probably there.
[02:31:19.874 --> 02:31:20.755]  This is a big deal.
[02:31:21.887 --> 02:31:26.029]  But we're going to get that posted today, make no doubt about it.
[02:31:26.429 --> 02:31:28.350]  But real quick, Jackie, finish up what you were saying.
[02:31:28.370 --> 02:31:28.610]  Okay.
[02:31:28.710 --> 02:31:36.793]  Well, it's in the Christian Science Monitor, and it's also in the New Zealand Herald, so your listeners can go look at it for themselves.
[02:31:37.453 --> 02:31:46.857]  The Christian Science Monitor article is really good because it's got all these links to papers and news articles
[02:31:48.383 --> 02:31:49.444]  Yes, I think so.
[02:32:13.381 --> 02:32:16.869]  Because I'd like to be able to read that.
[02:32:16.909 --> 02:32:18.814]  Go to the ACTV.org website.
[02:32:18.854 --> 02:32:19.736]  I believe it's there.
[02:32:19.857 --> 02:32:22.183]  Also, the Telecommunications Commission or the city.
[02:32:22.898 --> 02:32:26.642]  You know, I checked out all of those places yesterday, and I couldn't find a copy of the charter.
[02:32:26.662 --> 02:32:27.683]  Well, there's three charters.
[02:32:28.223 --> 02:32:31.446]  There's the telecommunications, the city, and the access charter.
[02:32:32.347 --> 02:32:45.220]  But I'm glad you called, because in the last segment, I will plug where the meeting is tomorrow night, where the board is going to sit up there and try to sell everybody on taking over free speech and how great it is.
[02:32:45.780 --> 02:32:53.563]  They've already started the merger with Austin Music Network, which will take over one of the channels to begin with, but I'll get all that information together for you.
[02:32:53.863 --> 02:32:54.403]  Okay, great.
[02:32:54.663 --> 02:32:55.143]  Thanks a lot.
[02:32:55.163 --> 02:32:55.483]  Take care.
[02:32:55.504 --> 02:32:55.824]  Okay, thanks.
[02:32:56.304 --> 02:32:56.584]  You bet.
[02:32:56.624 --> 02:33:01.766]  I've got to move quick now, folks, because I end up talking to callers forever and then don't get to everybody, and I've got news I want to hit here.
[02:33:02.386 --> 02:33:03.526]  Sean in Wisconsin.
[02:33:03.586 --> 02:33:04.407]  Sean, go ahead.
[02:33:04.707 --> 02:33:04.987]  Howdy.
[02:33:05.627 --> 02:33:05.887]  Hello.
[02:33:06.207 --> 02:33:11.049]  Just telling you what I observed on the morning news here about Operation Heartland Defense.
[02:33:12.062 --> 02:33:32.519]  Yeah, there were 81 organizations involved here in La Crosse, Wisconsin and the surrounding counties with this militarized so-called terrorist drill or disaster drill, but it had over 600 volunteers, 170 military units there, copters and everything else all working with the citizens and they're just trying to pass it off on the news like it was a
[02:33:33.260 --> 02:33:35.261]  Nothing really big, you know, the citizens were all excited about it.
[02:33:35.301 --> 02:33:35.842]  Yeah, I saw that.
[02:33:35.962 --> 02:33:45.507]  Helicopters swarming, regular army, National Guard, tattletale squads being recruited, all acclimating you to see tanks and troops and checkpoints.
[02:33:46.028 --> 02:33:50.690]  Yeah, I was just surprised to see it here in Wisconsin so quickly, but, you know, New World Order coming.
[02:33:51.371 --> 02:33:52.692]  Well, what did the people think of it?
[02:33:52.712 --> 02:33:54.092]  Well, they were all excited.
[02:33:54.112 --> 02:33:58.095]  They're, you know, covered in rags and fake blood and everything else, pretending to be hurt, you know.
[02:33:58.115 --> 02:34:00.116]  600 people, they're trying to reenact the...
[02:34:00.894 --> 02:34:05.035]  A supposed train derailment, but why is it called Operation Heartland Defense?
[02:34:05.055 --> 02:34:06.536]  What are they trying to defend against us?
[02:34:06.556 --> 02:34:16.599]  Also, what they do is they go to all the high school drama classes, because I've been to these, and they get the kids there as also part of the brainwashing program.
[02:34:18.059 --> 02:34:18.939]  That's just really sad.
[02:34:19.380 --> 02:34:20.560]  All right, thanks for the call, Sean.
[02:34:20.600 --> 02:34:22.280]  I'm glad you called with that information.
[02:34:22.741 --> 02:34:24.201]  Maureen in Virginia.
[02:34:24.241 --> 02:34:25.321]  Maureen, go ahead.
[02:34:25.621 --> 02:34:27.462]  Hey, I desperately need some help.
[02:34:28.055 --> 02:34:32.939]  Between September the 7th until October the 6th, Congress will be in session.
[02:34:33.699 --> 02:34:55.975]  I need everyone that hears this to call your senator, call your representative, call them every day until you receive a signed letter from them stating they realize a draft is against the 13th Amendment, they realize they took an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, and that if they commit the treasonous act,
[02:34:56.721 --> 02:34:58.222]  They will forfeit their pensions.
[02:34:58.362 --> 02:34:59.262]  Get it in writing.
[02:34:59.322 --> 02:35:02.323]  Call them every day until you get that in writing.
[02:35:02.704 --> 02:35:04.544]  But then also call them at their district offices.
[02:35:04.564 --> 02:35:06.365]  Call them at their campaign offices.
[02:35:06.385 --> 02:35:12.948]  Well, I think it's a good idea, but even if they sign the pledge, they'll go, that's before Chicago or Houston got hit with a dirty bomb.
[02:35:13.268 --> 02:35:16.730]  Things changed after 300,000 people died.
[02:35:17.070 --> 02:35:18.510]  We've got to do this now.
[02:35:18.690 --> 02:35:20.571]  Al-Qaeda hit us and hit us hard.
[02:35:20.831 --> 02:35:21.352]  You know what?
[02:35:21.512 --> 02:35:23.052]  I think we have to try, though, Alex.
[02:35:23.172 --> 02:35:24.373]  We have got to try.
[02:35:24.893 --> 02:35:29.274]  Well, we've got to call them and tell them that we know that it's going to be their domestic agencies doing this.
[02:35:29.834 --> 02:35:35.455]  As a caller said earlier, all this stuff's an inside job, folks.
[02:35:35.475 --> 02:35:41.076]  If you guys would do that, I've got a website drafted into slavery.com.
[02:35:41.556 --> 02:35:43.836]  Oh, I think I've heard you as a guest on shows.
[02:35:44.716 --> 02:35:45.717]  Actually, you have not.
[02:35:46.137 --> 02:35:47.717]  I called you once or twice.
[02:35:47.797 --> 02:35:49.057]  I called Joyce a couple times.
[02:35:49.677 --> 02:35:53.418]  Also, any businesses that will be adversely affected by the loss of
[02:35:54.133 --> 02:36:09.221]  The young people, either as customers or as employees, universities, high schools, trade schools, call and let them know, because I really and truly believe our God is able to stop this.
[02:36:09.542 --> 02:36:17.206]  Well, listen, we're trying to save lives here, and I agree with what you've said, but the problem is the globalists are going to carry out terror attacks.
[02:36:17.944 --> 02:36:23.066]  And they're going to start the new national draft, and then it's off to the races, and they've got the bills introduced.
[02:36:23.206 --> 02:36:24.307]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:36:24.327 --> 02:36:25.027]  We've got to stop it.
[02:36:25.047 --> 02:36:25.627]  Thanks for the call.
[02:36:26.668 --> 02:36:27.588]  And you've got a good website.
[02:36:27.628 --> 02:36:28.749]  I've actually seen that before.
[02:36:28.909 --> 02:36:30.690]  Okay, let's talk to Robert.
[02:36:31.930 --> 02:36:34.131]  Robert, where are you calling us from?
[02:36:34.571 --> 02:36:34.972]  Hi, Alex.
[02:36:35.032 --> 02:36:35.772]  I'm in Colorado.
[02:36:36.072 --> 02:36:36.672]  Welcome, sir.
[02:36:37.013 --> 02:36:37.373]  Thank you.
[02:36:37.953 --> 02:36:46.817]  Hey, I've heard on several talk shows here on the American Freedom Network in the past that there is a lawful and legal way around the draft.
[02:36:47.446 --> 02:36:47.806]  Yes.
[02:36:48.126 --> 02:36:58.171]  When they call you into the induction center, and they give you your physical and all that stuff, when they're all done with that, then they give you the oath.
[02:36:58.211 --> 02:37:00.352]  You have to raise your right hand and repeat the oath.
[02:37:00.999 --> 02:37:01.800]  After the officer.
[02:37:01.840 --> 02:37:07.044]  And the federal law says, and the Constitution says, you cannot be forced to swear an oath.
[02:37:07.064 --> 02:37:10.346]  The 13th Amendment says there can be no involuntary servitude.
[02:37:10.626 --> 02:37:11.027]  That's right.
[02:37:11.067 --> 02:37:13.949]  What they do, Alex, is they trick you into volunteering.
[02:37:14.389 --> 02:37:19.753]  What they'll do is they'll arrest a few young Hollywood people, and that does a couple things.
[02:37:19.954 --> 02:37:22.816]  Psychologically wise, oh, that rich person doesn't want to serve.
[02:37:23.276 --> 02:37:27.459]  Class envy gets in, and then they'll also prosecute them, give them a year in jail.
[02:37:27.780 --> 02:37:30.862]  That'll create the illusion that you've got to do it, that everyone will run off and
[02:37:30.902 --> 02:37:32.803]  Well, here's the most important thing, Alex.
[02:37:32.843 --> 02:37:35.763]  They tell you to take a step forward after they give you the oath.
[02:37:36.404 --> 02:37:37.644]  Do not take the step forward.
[02:37:38.284 --> 02:37:41.885]  You know, don't raise your hand, don't take the oath, and don't take the step forward.
[02:37:42.405 --> 02:37:57.989]  Yeah, it's a contract, and look, the reason I wouldn't be drafted is those controlling the government are the terrorists, and this government will send me to breathe depleted uranium, which their own manuals say will make me very sick or kill me.
[02:37:59.270 --> 02:37:59.950]  It also...
[02:38:00.928 --> 02:38:03.190]  They will give me all these experimental vaccines.
[02:38:04.751 --> 02:38:09.654]  Two years ago there was articles in Kansas City of people dying with maggots entering their brains at the VA hospitals.
[02:38:10.275 --> 02:38:11.616]  I never got to it last week.
[02:38:11.656 --> 02:38:17.320]  In a whole other state, another maggot infestation problem in the sinuses of the veterans.
[02:38:18.481 --> 02:38:21.323]  They are chained down to die, folks, and the maggots attack.
[02:38:21.803 --> 02:38:23.144]  The flies are all over their bodies.
[02:38:24.099 --> 02:38:27.301]  Another article of maggot infestation in the bodies of the troops.
[02:38:27.761 --> 02:38:28.501]  Live troops.
[02:38:29.002 --> 02:38:32.183]  So no, I'm not going to go serve them and then be chained down to be eaten by maggots.
[02:38:32.384 --> 02:38:32.844]  I don't believe you.
[02:38:32.884 --> 02:38:33.484]  Are you a veteran?
[02:38:34.024 --> 02:38:34.485]  No, I'm not.
[02:38:34.705 --> 02:38:34.985]  You're not?
[02:38:35.105 --> 02:38:35.345]  Okay.
[02:38:35.905 --> 02:38:36.486]  Well, I am.
[02:38:36.546 --> 02:38:39.808]  I was in the Army Rangers during the Vietnam War, and I came out a first lieutenant.
[02:38:39.848 --> 02:38:42.709]  So nobody can say that I'm a draft dodger.
[02:38:43.610 --> 02:38:51.494]  But I have talked this over with several people, including a young lady who signed up for the Navy, and her uncle, who was a
[02:38:52.566 --> 02:38:52.846]  I think so.
[02:39:12.918 --> 02:39:19.661]  Yeah, some people try to show up in a dress or... Well, they might make you stand there for the rest of the day, Alex.
[02:39:19.721 --> 02:39:25.583]  A guy might be there until 8 o'clock, 10 o'clock that night, waiting for him to move, you know what I mean?
[02:39:26.363 --> 02:39:32.325]  And what people got to do is, if they don't want to be drafted, they just stand there, don't take the oath, don't take the step forward.
[02:39:33.366 --> 02:39:36.647]  And they might yell at you, they might cuss at you, they might call you names.
[02:39:37.968 --> 02:39:38.888]  All kinds of things might happen.
[02:39:38.908 --> 02:39:40.609]  What happened to her when she did this?
[02:39:41.129 --> 02:39:41.229]  She...
[02:39:42.648 --> 02:39:43.268]  She didn't do it.
[02:39:43.428 --> 02:39:44.449]  She didn't take the oath.
[02:39:44.489 --> 02:39:45.989]  But I mean, did they yell and scream at her?
[02:39:46.009 --> 02:39:48.330]  No, sir, they didn't.
[02:39:48.531 --> 02:39:51.312]  Well, you served in Vietnam in the Rangers?
[02:39:51.832 --> 02:39:52.132]  Yes, sir.
[02:39:52.452 --> 02:39:53.973]  Boy, I bet you saw a lot of action.
[02:39:54.273 --> 02:39:54.613]  Oh, yeah.
[02:39:54.713 --> 02:39:59.355]  I also knew Lieutenant Kelly and his commander, Captain Medina.
[02:40:00.236 --> 02:40:05.218]  You remember the thing, they called it the My Lai Massacre?
[02:40:05.398 --> 02:40:05.678]  Yes.
[02:40:06.178 --> 02:40:08.179]  Both those guys told me they were ordered to do that.
[02:40:09.562 --> 02:40:10.343]  Well, you were there.
[02:40:11.324 --> 02:40:12.745]  You've stood up for what you believe.
[02:40:12.925 --> 02:40:14.106]  I wasn't there at the massacre.
[02:40:14.126 --> 02:40:15.768]  No, I know, but you were in Vietnam.
[02:40:16.008 --> 02:40:16.288]  Yes, sir.
[02:40:16.308 --> 02:40:21.713]  What I'm saying is, why would you now, let's say they try to call you back up, why would you say no?
[02:40:22.494 --> 02:40:26.617]  Oh, because I don't believe in a swore, because I've had a big change of mind.
[02:40:27.538 --> 02:40:35.025]  I've been involved in the patriot movement now since the early 90s, and I've always had in the back of my mind,
[02:40:35.652 --> 02:40:38.874]  I always had the idea that none of this stuff was correct anyhow.
[02:40:38.934 --> 02:40:40.115]  It was unconstitutional.
[02:40:40.555 --> 02:40:42.516]  All these empire wars, you know.
[02:40:42.696 --> 02:40:47.819]  It seems like America has taken over for the British Empire and now we're the world policeman.
[02:40:47.859 --> 02:40:50.181]  Well, then they do such horrible things.
[02:40:50.201 --> 02:40:50.781]  I mean, look.
[02:40:51.341 --> 02:40:53.743]  Every week there's a new article where right up until the mid-80s
[02:40:55.284 --> 02:41:00.447]  I mean, that's BBC Associated Press.
[02:41:00.827 --> 02:41:02.789]  I can show people the articles the government admits.
[02:41:03.129 --> 02:41:03.589]  I know.
[02:41:03.629 --> 02:41:04.850]  No one's going to be prosecuted.
[02:41:04.870 --> 02:41:05.711]  They were ordered to do it.
[02:41:05.731 --> 02:41:08.432]  I mean, we've got a government that will just kill you to test something?
[02:41:08.472 --> 02:41:10.894]  I mean, I'm not about to serve these criminals.
[02:41:11.554 --> 02:41:13.135]  I've got a son that just got out of the Navy.
[02:41:14.636 --> 02:41:17.638]  He was aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln.
[02:41:18.359 --> 02:41:19.820]  And he was forced to take two...
[02:41:20.422 --> 02:41:24.063]  Of the anthrax shots, I guess it's a series of what, four, five, six shots?
[02:41:24.183 --> 02:41:24.623]  Three.
[02:41:25.503 --> 02:41:30.504]  He had to take two of them along with all his shipmates, and they were all talking about, you know, refusing to do it.
[02:41:31.064 --> 02:41:36.545]  And they said if they refused, they would have to go before the mast, which, you know, is a... Court-martial.
[02:41:37.065 --> 02:41:39.525]  Right, that's a Navy way of saying getting a court-martial.
[02:41:41.086 --> 02:41:44.226]  So, yeah, that's the stuff that's going on now.
[02:41:44.926 --> 02:41:48.147]  And then there were the troops, you know, right after World War II,
[02:41:49.198 --> 02:41:58.662]  Who in, was it Nevada or somewhere like that, where they used to put them in foxholes, not very far from ground zero when they used to set off nuclear devices, just to see what would happen.
[02:41:58.682 --> 02:42:13.267]  I know the head captain of a, was very, you know, highest level security at the time in the 60s, and he was a captain, a Navy diver, but he was a captain over a submarine retrieval ship.
[02:42:14.907 --> 02:42:22.914]  And they dealt with a lot of radioactive things, and he can't talk about it, but a bunch of his group have died.
[02:42:22.954 --> 02:42:23.895]  He's real sick from it.
[02:42:24.335 --> 02:42:25.196]  He's real mad about it.
[02:42:25.236 --> 02:42:27.518]  I mean, they just treat you like total garbage.
[02:42:27.558 --> 02:42:28.179]  Thanks for the call.
[02:42:29.780 --> 02:42:33.343]  And he's active against the New World Order right here in Austin, and he's very well known.
[02:42:33.704 --> 02:42:40.630]  I ought to have him on the show sometime if he'd do it, but this is somebody who's involved in all that Cold War stuff, folks.
[02:42:40.650 --> 02:42:41.691]  I mean, you talk about super...
[02:42:42.731 --> 02:42:44.792]  Super tough guy.
[02:42:45.472 --> 02:42:47.232]  It doesn't get any tougher than that, folks.
[02:42:48.053 --> 02:42:51.874]  The people that just had deep diving and all that craziness.
[02:42:52.834 --> 02:42:53.894]  Count me out, folks.
[02:42:54.935 --> 02:42:57.195]  He knows all about the New World Order now, believe me.
[02:42:57.215 --> 02:42:59.256]  But again, it's after the fact.
[02:42:59.296 --> 02:43:01.136]  And then they always got a new crop of people.
[02:43:02.377 --> 02:43:05.838]  Let us go ahead now and take two more calls.
[02:43:05.858 --> 02:43:07.258]  We've got to hit some final news here.
[02:43:08.058 --> 02:43:10.059]  Let's talk to Robert in Colorado.
[02:43:10.079 --> 02:43:10.619]  Go ahead, Robert.
[02:43:11.624 --> 02:43:12.225]  That was Robert.
[02:43:12.245 --> 02:43:13.005]  I'm losing my mind.
[02:43:13.405 --> 02:43:14.927]  One last call that I'm going to have time for.
[02:43:14.947 --> 02:43:15.967]  I knew that was Robert.
[02:43:16.488 --> 02:43:17.849]  Tara in California.
[02:43:18.129 --> 02:43:19.430]  Actually, it is Colorado.
[02:43:19.490 --> 02:43:21.091]  Okay, go ahead, Tara.
[02:43:21.171 --> 02:43:22.713]  I'll get something right someday.
[02:43:23.033 --> 02:43:23.733]  You're doing great.
[02:43:23.753 --> 02:43:25.595]  Don't worry about it.
[02:43:25.835 --> 02:43:29.378]  I just wanted to make a comment about a lot, because it seems like a theme today.
[02:43:29.398 --> 02:43:36.123]  A lot of people are talking about how do we extricate ourselves from all this madness.
[02:43:36.784 --> 02:43:49.214]  And this is pretty advanced information, of course, and I think you've talked about it sometime in the past, but kind of working on the whole sovereignty thing and getting information on that.
[02:43:49.274 --> 02:43:53.157]  And I just encourage people to get information, to do the research.
[02:43:53.177 --> 02:43:58.702]  And a few people like Winston Shrout and Bryce McCloud
[02:43:59.392 --> 02:44:03.436]  And that lot seem to have a pretty good line on all this stuff.
[02:44:03.456 --> 02:44:08.700]  But again, I really recommend people doing research on their own to find their own path.
[02:44:08.820 --> 02:44:12.503]  I don't think that there is a really defined path yet.
[02:44:12.563 --> 02:44:15.306]  But that's, I think, our only way to freedom.
[02:44:16.347 --> 02:44:21.971]  Since we have all the pacts with all the other governments and stuff like that that you have mentioned, I don't think there's any other way.
[02:44:22.011 --> 02:44:24.934]  I think we just have to work within the system to get out of this.
[02:44:27.068 --> 02:44:37.514]  Well, I think everybody being involved, everybody picking an issue or two to get involved in, just going to government meetings and watch what they're doing, that's how we're going to turn things around.
[02:44:37.634 --> 02:44:38.575]  And I agree with you.
[02:44:38.595 --> 02:44:41.897]  I mean, everybody's got a different angle they should attack in this fight.
[02:44:42.377 --> 02:44:43.217]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:44:43.237 --> 02:44:51.342]  You know, I know that there hasn't been much talk of that sort of thing, of getting out of the system, quote-unquote.
[02:44:51.704 --> 02:45:00.653]  But I just, you know, want to introduce people to it if they've never heard of it before and, you know, to encourage them to do some research on the Internet and stuff.
[02:45:00.673 --> 02:45:01.134]  I hear you.
[02:45:01.154 --> 02:45:02.195]  Thanks for the call.
[02:45:03.196 --> 02:45:09.462]  Drugs Report Newsweek and Reuters are reporting officials capital among new U.S.
[02:45:09.502 --> 02:45:09.923]  targets.
[02:45:09.963 --> 02:45:11.564]  And, of course, they told U.S.
[02:45:11.604 --> 02:45:14.988]  News and World Report that a few months ago that it will be attacked was the quote.
[02:45:16.540 --> 02:45:20.622]  And now Drudge is fear-mongering with these FBI agents going, Oh, it's looking worse and worse.
[02:45:20.662 --> 02:45:21.562]  We're going to be attacked.
[02:45:21.722 --> 02:45:22.482]  Oh, it's all over.
[02:45:23.023 --> 02:45:24.023]  Give your freedoms up.
[02:45:25.824 --> 02:45:34.687]  And it says, Assessing the accumulation of evidence of a possible attack inside the U.S., a senior intelligence official tells Time magazine that it's looking more and more like the real deal every day.
[02:45:34.767 --> 02:45:39.889]  Time also learns that Osama bin Laden may already have ordered up another attack.
[02:45:39.929 --> 02:45:44.791]  A top Homeland Security official tells Time, We have a number of times picked up information that Al-Qaeda...
[02:45:46.075 --> 02:45:51.059]  He wants to attack us before the election, and some of the communications attribute to describe it to Osama bin Laden.
[02:45:51.560 --> 02:45:54.422]  Of course, Bush already had focus groups publicly three months ago.
[02:45:54.982 --> 02:45:58.385]  Look at this, and if there's an attack, that's going to help him, even if there is an election.
[02:45:59.806 --> 02:46:01.348]  So, you know, a real election.
[02:46:01.388 --> 02:46:06.632]  So that's very, very serious information there for you.
[02:46:07.052 --> 02:46:10.175]  Also, hundreds rallied last month against the U.N.
[02:46:10.215 --> 02:46:11.636]  monitoring U.S.
[02:46:11.696 --> 02:46:12.257]  elections.
[02:46:13.388 --> 02:46:31.623]  Back in late July, this is out of PRWeb, Anton Skratovic will formally be announcing his candidacy for the 14th Congressional District in New York, which he did during a rally to protest the attempt by his opponent, Carolyn Maloney, to have the United Nations oversee our national elections this fall.
[02:46:33.104 --> 02:46:36.707]  And, you know, sounds good, but again, here's the problem.
[02:46:38.088 --> 02:46:38.748]  The U.N.
[02:46:39.049 --> 02:46:41.771]  isn't allowed 50 feet from the facilities.
[02:46:43.623 --> 02:46:47.689]  The UN has been caught stealing elections and helping overthrow countries all over the planet.
[02:46:47.729 --> 02:46:48.771]  It's run by the same people.
[02:46:50.135 --> 02:46:55.678]  We have ways of getting rid of these electronic voting machines and demanding paper ballots be printed out of them and stored.
[02:46:55.958 --> 02:46:57.098]  But no, that's not going to happen.
[02:46:57.138 --> 02:47:08.543]  No, the solution from the Democrats is send in the U.N., which legitimizes it in people's minds as a global body, countering corruption, and gives phony conservatives something to act anti-U.N.
[02:47:08.583 --> 02:47:08.863]  about.
[02:47:09.223 --> 02:47:13.986]  Something to run around and scream about when it's Bush, Colin Powell, who brought these U.N.
[02:47:14.006 --> 02:47:14.866]  people in to begin with.
[02:47:18.527 --> 02:47:19.327]  And the U.N.
[02:47:19.347 --> 02:47:22.148]  will criticize some small things, but say it's all accidental.
[02:47:22.208 --> 02:47:26.408]  It'll criticize Republicans and Democrats, and that's what they're going to say after the election.
[02:47:26.448 --> 02:47:26.909]  You watch.
[02:47:28.269 --> 02:47:31.809]  And, of course, I've written the headline, Satan to Monitor to Lucifer, U.N.
[02:47:31.849 --> 02:47:32.890]  Body to Monitor to U.S.
[02:47:32.930 --> 02:47:35.210]  Elections, and the left hand to monitor the right hand.
[02:47:36.670 --> 02:47:45.872]  We already talked about the leak at a Japanese nuclear power plant, but don't worry, none of the radiation got outside the building and everything's fine, other than four people dead and a bunch of others injured.
[02:47:47.437 --> 02:48:01.365]  Also, very confusing, why are they now issuing arrest warrants for Chalibi, the big torture master from Iran, the bank robber from Jordan, who was going to be the head guy over there?
[02:48:01.705 --> 02:48:03.546]  Why are they suddenly cutting him loose?
[02:48:03.586 --> 02:48:10.130]  Is this to make him look legitimate in people's eyes, or is this criminals fighting with each other?
[02:48:11.731 --> 02:48:12.391]  Very interesting.
[02:48:12.752 --> 02:48:15.213]  And Iraqis have reinstated capital punishment.
[02:48:15.962 --> 02:48:31.566]  Which I wouldn't have a problem with, but again, if you have a corrupt dictatorship, a corrupt appointed government run by torture masters, the new president's just as bad or worse than Chalibi, been involved in the same stuff, can you have him doling out the death penalty?
[02:48:31.586 --> 02:48:37.508]  I mean, I'm for the death penalty, but I'm not for Adolf Hitler or Saddam Hussein or Chalibi to be doling it out.
[02:48:37.548 --> 02:48:39.729]  See, that's why I'm really against the death penalty.
[02:48:39.789 --> 02:48:40.309]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:44.460 --> 02:48:48.806]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:48.986 --> 02:48:53.312]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:55.529 --> 02:48:57.912]  Use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:57.952 --> 02:49:00.855]  The New World Order can emerge.
[02:49:01.115 --> 02:49:05.340]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:12.327]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act Legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:12.448 --> 02:49:14.470]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:14.690 --> 02:49:25.272]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:25.432 --> 02:49:30.853]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:49:50.197 --> 02:49:56.359]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:49:56.639 --> 02:50:05.081]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:50:05.341 --> 02:50:12.343]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:50:12.663 --> 02:50:17.486]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:50:17.686 --> 02:50:23.110]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:50:23.450 --> 02:50:26.512]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.

[02:51:48.426 --> 02:51:50.067]  All right, we're almost out of time here.
[02:51:50.107 --> 02:51:54.291]  I'm going to have an announcement about the Access TV meeting tomorrow night here in a few minutes.
[02:51:54.311 --> 02:51:55.932]  Get ready with a pen and paper, please.
[02:51:58.537 --> 02:52:02.999]  Again, America's Bogus Beheading Video, Dupes International Media, Sydney Morning Herald.
[02:52:03.039 --> 02:52:09.562]  This guy did a fake beheading video, posted it, the government all announced it as real, uploaded it to a Muslim website.
[02:52:09.962 --> 02:52:13.384]  He's not a Muslim, now the FBI might arrest him because they want to arrest him.
[02:52:14.284 --> 02:52:16.605]  Just to show you how fake any of this stuff can be.
[02:52:16.925 --> 02:52:18.066]  And that's why he says he did it.
[02:52:18.935 --> 02:52:25.920]  Frank says Kerry qualified for president and says that he's very brave and wonderful and he doesn't know who he's going to endorse.
[02:52:26.320 --> 02:52:28.561]  Doesn't know which skull and bones lord to endorse.
[02:52:29.242 --> 02:52:31.623]  Just more incredible statements.
[02:52:33.204 --> 02:52:40.589]  Also, big brother in the car, the Washington Times, goes on to talk about the National Transportation Safety Board are trying to leverage...
[02:52:42.092 --> 02:52:47.373]  A emotional incident to push regulations that infringe on American privacy and civil liberties.
[02:52:47.393 --> 02:52:51.794]  Now, I've talked for years about how all new cars have these black boxes in them.
[02:52:53.194 --> 02:52:56.815]  They say 70 to 90 percent have them.
[02:52:56.975 --> 02:53:01.276]  But that's the new fancy box that does even more.
[02:53:01.676 --> 02:53:03.496]  That's how they play semantical games.
[02:53:03.536 --> 02:53:07.077]  And the article goes on to admit and says, well...
[02:53:09.759 --> 02:53:12.906]  That they're going to go ahead and do this and that it's already in the cars.
[02:53:12.946 --> 02:53:15.271]  It tracks everything you do, guilty until proven innocent.
[02:53:15.612 --> 02:53:17.957]  You're going five miles over the speed limit and have a wreck?
[02:53:18.815 --> 02:53:21.036]  They then go pull it out and criminally charge you?
[02:53:21.057 --> 02:53:23.578]  I mean, I see these articles every week, folks.
[02:53:24.098 --> 02:53:24.699]  Also, U.S.
[02:53:24.739 --> 02:53:28.181]  soldier in Iraq abuse commended for good job.
[02:53:28.861 --> 02:53:30.882]  And this is out of the Associated Press.
[02:53:31.143 --> 02:53:33.784]  England, remember the little dwarf that likes to torture people?
[02:53:34.685 --> 02:53:37.406]  21 is at the center of the probe into alleged abuse at the jail.
[02:53:37.867 --> 02:53:42.049]  She says that she was ordered by Army intelligence to carry it out and told that she'd done a good job.
[02:53:42.449 --> 02:53:43.750]  They're all saying that now.
[02:53:43.790 --> 02:53:44.491]  It's true.
[02:53:44.531 --> 02:53:44.711]  I mean...
[02:53:45.817 --> 02:53:48.579]  Our government admitted on national TV they've been torturing people.
[02:53:49.840 --> 02:53:53.282]  Bacterial infection kills 100 patients at Quebec Hospital.
[02:53:53.742 --> 02:54:00.666]  And these super, and this is out of Canadian Broadcasting, out of Toronto, these super bacteria are getting worse and worse and worse.
[02:54:01.647 --> 02:54:02.748]  Very, very serious.
[02:54:02.768 --> 02:54:04.789]  We'll continue to watch that for you as well.
[02:54:06.691 --> 02:54:11.393]  I've written a little press release about First Step and Austin Access Television Takeover Complete.
[02:54:11.493 --> 02:54:15.595]  I will be posting the time and date of the meeting tomorrow night on the website by this evening.
[02:54:16.456 --> 02:54:18.036]  But here's the announcement.
[02:54:18.136 --> 02:54:20.738]  ACTV Community Forum, when?
[02:54:20.978 --> 02:54:24.099]  Tuesday, August 10th, that's tomorrow night, 7 p.m.
[02:54:24.119 --> 02:54:25.460]  to 8.45 p.m.
[02:54:25.840 --> 02:54:27.941]  at the Millennium Youth Entertainment Center.
[02:54:27.961 --> 02:54:30.162]  It's like a bowling alley club they built for kids.
[02:54:30.859 --> 02:54:31.780]  Kids in East Austin.
[02:54:31.820 --> 02:54:33.861]  It's a nice place, I'm told.
[02:54:33.901 --> 02:54:35.041]  I've driven by it many times.
[02:54:35.101 --> 02:54:39.504]  But it's got a big auditorium, so if you want to come, I hope to see you there.
[02:54:39.584 --> 02:54:44.886]  And if they don't let the producers speak, you should be heard and tell them you don't want their propaganda.
[02:54:44.926 --> 02:54:46.707]  You don't want the end of the First Amendment.
[02:54:47.168 --> 02:54:54.151]  You want them to get rid of this plan to merge AMN and take over Channel 16 and then start restricting our speech on the final channel.
[02:54:54.752 --> 02:54:57.293]  Millennium Youth Entertainment Center, 1156 Hargrave Street.
[02:55:00.057 --> 02:55:03.480]  The corner of Hargrave and Rosewood, just east of ACTV.
[02:55:04.481 --> 02:55:05.341]  You cannot miss it.
[02:55:05.922 --> 02:55:14.809]  You just go down east 11th, it turns into Rosewood, and then the next street is Hargrave, and it's right there, you can't miss it.
[02:55:15.089 --> 02:55:19.312]  1156 Hargrave Street, and we'll post this on Infowars.com.
[02:55:20.013 --> 02:55:26.538]  Or I guess call Access Television nicely, nice folks answer the phone, they're just employees, and ask them for details if you miss it.
[02:55:27.971 --> 02:55:29.992]  At 478-8600 with a 512 in front of it.
[02:55:31.112 --> 02:55:31.912]  I am out of time.
[02:55:31.953 --> 02:55:33.213]  Great broadcast today.
[02:55:33.253 --> 02:55:35.874]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:55:35.934 --> 02:55:37.394]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:55:37.994 --> 02:55:39.915]  Want to see everybody out there tomorrow at this meeting.
[02:55:40.335 --> 02:55:42.696]  All over the country, get involved with Access Television.
[02:55:42.836 --> 02:55:45.257]  Use it while it's still there to educate people in your area.
[02:55:45.517 --> 02:55:50.438]  It's an incredibly powerful chink in the New World Order's iron curtain of information control.
[02:55:51.278 --> 02:55:55.160]  Or better yet, go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:55:55.640 --> 02:55:56.660]  Get my videos.
[02:55:57.409 --> 02:55:58.330]  Get them out to people.
[02:55:58.410 --> 02:55:59.511]  Air them on AXS TV.
[02:56:00.051 --> 02:56:03.053]  Make copies of my films for non-profit, non-for-sale purposes.
[02:56:03.513 --> 02:56:06.375]  Infowars.com or prisonplanet.tv to order.
[02:56:06.896 --> 02:56:12.300]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:56:13.441 --> 02:56:17.383]  Your support is absolutely vital.
[02:56:17.403 --> 02:56:18.784]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:56:19.885 --> 02:56:22.467]  All it takes is good people standing up and saying no to evil.
[02:56:22.607 --> 02:56:24.629]  But when we do nothing, evil triumphs.
[02:56:25.329 --> 02:56:26.470]  As the Founding Fathers said.
[02:56:27.339 --> 02:56:28.583]  Again, God bless you all.
[02:56:28.984 --> 02:56:30.388]  Get out there and take on corruption.
[02:56:30.428 --> 02:56:32.754]  Stand up for your family and say no to the New World Order.
