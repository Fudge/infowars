[00:00:05.864 --> 00:00:06.544]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.165 --> 00:00:08.266]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.946 --> 00:00:10.047]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.707 --> 00:00:11.508]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.268 --> 00:00:13.169]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:17.512]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.032 --> 00:00:22.135]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.295 --> 00:00:24.757]  Music
[00:00:32.762 --> 00:00:35.984]  Well, you're going to be glad that you tuned in today.
[00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:43.068]  If you want to be truly informed, this is another ultra-massive broadcast.
[00:00:44.529 --> 00:01:00.858]  Kyle Hens, co-founder of 911 Citizens Watch and a contributor to unansweredquestions.org, who's been in all of these different commission meetings, the 11 public ones, who was there when Christopher Broder stood up and said, remember your government funded and created Al-Qaeda.
[00:01:02.388 --> 00:01:09.792]  We'll be able to hear all the stuff we missed after they cut the feed on C-SPAN three days ago.
[00:01:10.692 --> 00:01:13.614]  They're joining us in 14 minutes.
[00:01:14.854 --> 00:01:20.517]  The lovely and intelligent and dynamic Stephanie is going to be calling them here in about 10 minutes and getting them on the line.
[00:01:22.253 --> 00:01:34.500]  Then, coming up in the second hour, former Staff Sergeant Jimmy Massey, who has come out and told the world, I killed innocent people for our government in the Sacramento Bee.
[00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:36.321]  That's right.
[00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:45.747]  Then in the third hour, William Bunch of the Philadelphia Daily News on the Berg beheading and his article, Berg Met with Shady Iraqi.
[00:01:47.017 --> 00:01:49.418]  So we'll be going over that in the third hour.
[00:01:49.518 --> 00:01:51.860]  We'll take some calls today, not in the first hour.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.361]  We will in the second and third with those guests.
[00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:58.143]  But in this hour, the next ten minutes, I'm going to go over some of the top stories.
[00:01:58.964 --> 00:02:03.246]  Then we'll get Christopher Broder, who stood up, and we're going to play that clip again.
[00:02:04.267 --> 00:02:06.228]  And, of course, Kyle Hens.
[00:02:06.828 --> 00:02:12.652]  And next week, I've got some of the widows who were there standing up as well.
[00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:15.656]  Coming on the broadcast.
[00:02:15.736 --> 00:02:18.278]  Widows and women who lost their sons and daughters.
[00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.021]  That is coming up next week as well.
[00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:28.525]  But in this Friday's edition, we have just got ultra-massive amounts of key news for you.
[00:02:29.086 --> 00:02:33.869]  Diebold's voting machine expansion rattles investor states.
[00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.171]  We'll get into some of the latest election scamming that's going on.
[00:02:38.152 --> 00:02:42.795]  Also, we're going to get into the new details of prison abuse emerge.
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.501]  Just grisly stuff coming out.
[00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:47.703]  The question is, why are they releasing this?
[00:02:47.743 --> 00:02:49.785]  If they didn't want to release this, they wouldn't be releasing it.
[00:02:50.505 --> 00:03:01.095]  We'll talk about that bigger picture, beating people to death, posing with their dead bodies, beating them while they're in sexual positions, and most of these people completely, totally innocent on top of it.
[00:03:01.435 --> 00:03:06.920]  You don't just not torture a supposed terrorist, but you don't torture families you pull over on the side of the road.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.282]  I don't care how sick you are, neocons.
[00:03:10.407 --> 00:03:14.572]  I mean, I don't know how you got to this psychological point of saying this is all great.
[00:03:15.894 --> 00:03:19.399]  Again, videos amplify a picture of extreme violence.
[00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:21.822]  Bush says Iraqis ready to take power.
[00:03:21.882 --> 00:03:23.685]  That's a total joke, a total fraud.
[00:03:24.654 --> 00:03:27.296]  Military shrugs off attacks on wedding party.
[00:03:27.476 --> 00:03:31.159]  OPEC, not to blame for high oil prices, says the president of OPEC.
[00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:32.360]  And that's actually true.
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.441]  I mean, they go over the evidence.
[00:03:33.961 --> 00:03:34.822]  We don't run this.
[00:03:34.902 --> 00:03:36.183]  We don't make all the profits.
[00:03:36.283 --> 00:03:37.204]  We don't control it.
[00:03:37.744 --> 00:03:38.805]  Stop blaming us.
[00:03:39.225 --> 00:03:42.227]  It's the oil companies, and it is the oil companies.
[00:03:42.668 --> 00:03:45.730]  But it's easier to blame the Arabs and the Venezuelans, isn't it?
[00:03:46.951 --> 00:03:49.373]  So we'll be going over that for you.
[00:03:50.514 --> 00:03:55.397]  Also, Ebola-like virus confirmed in western Equatoria.
[00:03:56.597 --> 00:03:58.398]  Scary article out of Africa.
[00:03:58.418 --> 00:04:01.780]  EU supports WTO membership for Russia.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.881]  That's part of the global government formation.
[00:04:04.642 --> 00:04:07.203]  Bulldozers keep on demolishing in Rafah.
[00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:13.377]  And there's an editorial in the Washington Times saying press can't get abuse story.
[00:04:13.417 --> 00:04:18.440]  They can't let it go as if people are bad to even be reporting on this.
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.182]  And more on Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9-11.
[00:04:23.203 --> 00:04:32.829]  I typed in Alex Jones Fahrenheit 9-11 and even before this New York Post article yesterday basically saying Moore ripped me off.
[00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:35.000]  It was already being said on the web.
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.720]  And I'm not saying Moore did that.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.701]  I mean, he can tell the story of 9-11.
[00:04:39.181 --> 00:04:40.322]  It's public fact.
[00:04:40.762 --> 00:04:46.144]  Just because he tells the story similarly to the way I did it doesn't mean that he ripped me off.
[00:04:46.204 --> 00:04:46.964]  It's just the facts.
[00:04:47.445 --> 00:04:49.766]  Though he puts his own little UN spin on it.
[00:04:49.786 --> 00:04:51.766]  I mean, I'm glad Moore's made this film.
[00:04:51.966 --> 00:04:54.928]  It's unfortunate he's put a liberal spin on it.
[00:04:55.468 --> 00:04:56.408]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:56.448 --> 00:04:56.888]  Stay with us.
[00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:02.891]  Is the air you breathe killing you?
[00:05:03.607 --> 00:05:03.907]  What?
[00:05:04.007 --> 00:05:10.130]  The Environmental Protection Agency studies state that indoor air is up to 70 times more polluted than outdoor city air.
[00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:12.332]  Even Oprah addressed this concern on her show.
[00:05:12.692 --> 00:05:13.192]  Heard enough?
[00:05:13.772 --> 00:05:14.413]  Sure have.
[00:05:14.653 --> 00:05:16.194]  How can I purify my air?
[00:05:16.454 --> 00:05:16.714]  Easy.
[00:05:17.054 --> 00:05:19.675]  Start with a visit to PurifyMyAir.com.

[00:05:54.485 --> 00:06:00.986]  I'm going to call 1-888-88-MY-AIR or I'm going to purifymyair.com.
[00:06:01.186 --> 00:06:02.707]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:02.887 --> 00:06:05.987]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:06:06.107 --> 00:06:10.028]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:06:10.068 --> 00:06:14.289]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State to the Takeover.
[00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:18.410]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:19.750]  The Civil Emergency was created...
[00:06:21.532 --> 00:06:28.598]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:06:28.778 --> 00:06:31.820]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:34.883]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:06:35.343 --> 00:06:41.469]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:06:41.989 --> 00:06:42.510]  We're good to go.
[00:07:00.385 --> 00:07:01.965]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:02.366 --> 00:07:08.107]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:07:08.347 --> 00:07:13.488]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:23.111]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:07:23.471 --> 00:07:28.413]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:07:28.733 --> 00:07:32.754]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:07:32.954 --> 00:07:37.716]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:07:38.076 --> 00:07:43.998]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:07:44.338 --> 00:07:50.567]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:07:50.607 --> 00:07:51.589]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:07:51.649 --> 00:07:52.550]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:08:01.152 --> 00:08:06.174]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.534 --> 00:08:08.875]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:14.276 --> 00:08:28.881]  Remember three days ago during the Rudolph Giuliani whitewash kangaroo court event that some of the widows and some of the men and women who'd lost children
[00:08:29.779 --> 00:08:41.656]  In the 9-11 globalist attack, in the Phantom Menace attack, that they stood up and basically shut the meeting down and then C-SPAN cut the feed.
[00:08:42.277 --> 00:08:45.462]  We've played the clip up to the point that C-SPAN cut the feed.
[00:08:46.212 --> 00:09:00.644]  And we're going to find out what else was said and exactly what transpired and why these people have questions coming up here in about five minutes with Christopher Broder, investigative journalist and activist who confronted Giuliani in the 11th public hearing on the 9-11 Commission.
[00:09:01.324 --> 00:09:07.209]  Also, Kyle Hens, co-founder of 9-11 Citizens Watch and contributor to unansweredquestions.org.
[00:09:07.869 --> 00:09:10.892]  He was present at the 11th public hearing as well.
[00:09:11.883 --> 00:09:16.545]  Then we've got big guests in the second and third hour, so you'll want to stay with us.
[00:09:17.065 --> 00:09:23.868]  The websites are prisonplanet.com, infowars.com, and now prisonplanet.tv as well.
[00:09:25.369 --> 00:09:29.571]  But right now, let's just in the next few minutes jump into some more of the important news.
[00:09:30.011 --> 00:09:39.175]  New photos and video have emerged via the Washington Post, which is the big Bilderberg group-controlled New World Order propaganda body.
[00:09:41.028 --> 00:09:48.532]  Some of these photos first surfaced a month ago on CBS 60 Minutes, which is you can't get any more New World Order than that as well.
[00:09:49.032 --> 00:09:52.914]  They've known about this for two years in Afghanistan, for over a year in Iraq.
[00:09:53.795 --> 00:09:57.436]  Photos and videos for years have been all over the foreign media.
[00:09:57.977 --> 00:10:01.798]  Generals have resigned, refusing to torture people at Guantanamo Bay.
[00:10:02.099 --> 00:10:03.659]  I mean, all of this has been public.
[00:10:03.739 --> 00:10:04.820]  We've been talking about it forever.
[00:10:05.979 --> 00:10:07.621]  Why did it just now come out?
[00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:14.787]  Because I said that we had to be humiliated before the UN takes over Iraq here in just about two weeks from now.
[00:10:15.648 --> 00:10:16.969]  Less than two weeks, week and a half.
[00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.491]  Now, of course, our troops will still be there.
[00:10:19.551 --> 00:10:25.056]  We'll just be under UN control and under the new puppet government, the second new government to be appointed.
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.161]  The Iraqi Council, the first one was appointed.
[00:10:28.201 --> 00:10:29.501]  The second one will be appointed.
[00:10:29.761 --> 00:10:31.562]  It is not democracy.
[00:10:31.862 --> 00:10:32.983]  It is not a republic.
[00:10:33.203 --> 00:10:45.127]  It is total dictatorship with regional governors, viceroys over different sectors, exactly like the different imperial governments that have been installed there in the past by the British.
[00:10:45.908 --> 00:10:46.788]  That's all this is.
[00:10:47.109 --> 00:10:48.949]  So why now is all this coming out?
[00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:58.734]  So they can have a debate about torture, then show the bird beheading, and then legitimize all of the torture, while at the same time demonizing us overseas.
[00:10:59.194 --> 00:11:02.616]  The propaganda domestically is this is a wonderful thing, let's just accept it.
[00:11:02.956 --> 00:11:10.180]  Overseas, America is so evil, we need to have the UN come in and run America and defang the dangerous right-wingers.
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.422]  That's what Michael Moore is saying in his 9-11 film, in his 9-11 book.
[00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:17.871]  Dude, where's my country?
[00:11:18.051 --> 00:11:19.753]  We need the UN to take over America.
[00:11:19.793 --> 00:11:20.633]  That is indeed in there.
[00:11:20.673 --> 00:11:24.897]  So see, this is the energizing of the left-wing arm of the world government.
[00:11:25.237 --> 00:11:27.599]  Whereas it's, again, an arm is attached to a body.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.761]  The right arm is attached to the same body.
[00:11:29.982 --> 00:11:32.123]  It is the same system, the same people running it.
[00:11:32.464 --> 00:11:40.451]  They want to keep you in this left-right debate that neutralizes all real political movements and progress.
[00:11:42.009 --> 00:11:46.511]  So that's the reality here, and new details of prison abuse emerge.
[00:11:46.631 --> 00:11:54.693]  Abu Ghraib detainees' statements describe sexual humiliation and savage beatings, and now they've released more photos and video of this.
[00:11:55.133 --> 00:12:01.115]  Video begins with three soldiers huddled around a naked detainee, his thin frame backed against a wall with a snap of his wrist.
[00:12:01.456 --> 00:12:04.777]  One of the soldiers slaps the man across the left cheek so hard the prisoner's knees buckle.
[00:12:05.057 --> 00:12:08.218]  Another detainee, handcuffed on his back, is dragged over to the prison floor.
[00:12:08.818 --> 00:12:11.239]  Then it goes on to the beating and the sexual posing.
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:18.143]  But notice they're focusing in on England having sex in front of them or people beating them or making them do weird sexual things.
[00:12:18.643 --> 00:12:22.925]  Why aren't they focusing in on the released photos of them posing with people they've beaten to death?
[00:12:24.226 --> 00:12:31.949]  You notice they're not releasing the photos of them raping women, beating children, and other things I'm not going to mention, which they admit they have photos and video of.
[00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:33.370]  No, they're not going to release that.
[00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.911]  They're going to release the lighter stuff.
[00:12:36.135 --> 00:12:40.159]  And they give one of these thugs a year in prison when they openly were following orders.
[00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:44.402]  I think they need 100 years in prison for raping and torturing and killing.
[00:12:45.003 --> 00:12:52.489]  But understand, the people who gave the orders, they are the cold-blooded masters in all of this.
[00:12:52.569 --> 00:12:57.153]  They are the premeditative murderers, and they deserve to be prosecuted.
[00:12:58.134 --> 00:13:03.859]  But don't expect that to happen of Lord Rumsfeld, who Bush says is doing a superb job.
[00:13:05.054 --> 00:13:18.502]  And so Bush says Iraqis are ready to take power, Iraqis are ready to take the training wheels off and assume political power for the U.S.-led coalition, President Bush said yesterday, as his administration began to roll out a rough plan for the June 30th transition of authority.
[00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:20.103]  Well, we've read the plan.
[00:13:20.544 --> 00:13:21.684]  They'll have no authority.
[00:13:22.505 --> 00:13:23.545]  They're told what to do.
[00:13:23.605 --> 00:13:26.467]  They're appointed by Mr. Bremer.
[00:13:27.028 --> 00:13:29.189]  And now we're going to have Necroponte over there.
[00:13:30.726 --> 00:13:32.427]  Running things after Brimmer leaves.
[00:13:32.747 --> 00:13:34.688]  It's a totally staged deal.
[00:13:35.188 --> 00:13:35.769]  I'm sorry.
[00:13:35.789 --> 00:13:43.513]  I mean, if I come into your town with a bunch of thugs, point guns at you, and then appoint five people from the town to be your, quote, leaders, that isn't an election.
[00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:44.393]  That isn't freedom.
[00:13:44.573 --> 00:13:46.274]  That isn't democracy.
[00:13:47.094 --> 00:13:47.595]  It isn't.
[00:13:47.615 --> 00:13:50.436]  I mean, do I have to explain that that isn't?
[00:13:50.816 --> 00:13:53.157]  An appointed government is not elected?
[00:13:53.177 --> 00:13:55.178]  And they're calling this the handover?
[00:13:55.459 --> 00:13:58.100]  They're now going to put more troops into Iraq, they're now saying.
[00:13:59.059 --> 00:14:00.922]  We're going to have more troops there under U.N.
[00:14:00.962 --> 00:14:02.504]  control with the U.N.
[00:14:02.524 --> 00:14:03.926]  directing this new government.
[00:14:04.567 --> 00:14:05.709]  Now, this is a sick joke.
[00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:07.952]  Do we have our guest now?
[00:14:11.978 --> 00:14:13.520]  Oh, we do have Christopher?
[00:14:14.844 --> 00:14:16.105]  Okay, fantastic.
[00:14:16.125 --> 00:14:23.610]  We're about to go to Christopher Broder, investigative journalist and activist who confronted Giuliani at the hearings a few days ago.
[00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:26.952]  We're going to find out what we missed after C-SPAN cut the feed.
[00:14:27.372 --> 00:14:40.260]  But before we go to our guest that we're getting online, let's go ahead and play that audio clip of Christopher Broder confronting Giuliani and bringing up all the key points of, you know, why are you threatening to arrest the whistleblowers?
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:45.803]  And then Widow's screaming, Building 7, why did it come down?
[00:14:45.863 --> 00:14:47.083]  Why did NORAD stand down?
[00:14:47.143 --> 00:14:47.944]  Where were the jets?
[00:14:47.984 --> 00:14:51.646]  And then, remember, your government created and funded Al-Qaeda.
[00:14:52.486 --> 00:14:54.047]  So let's go ahead and play that clip.
[00:14:54.327 --> 00:14:55.668]  Deeply appreciative of that.
[00:14:56.728 --> 00:15:01.871]  And we may very well want to ask you further questions as we finalize our report.
[00:15:03.052 --> 00:15:09.615]  As Midwesterner, I might say to you, I've been impressed time and again with the pride you've expressed in New York City.
[00:15:10.695 --> 00:15:13.277]  And I admire that greatly.
[00:15:13.677 --> 00:15:23.044]  And I think that may very well be one of the reasons for the success of your leadership.
[00:15:23.384 --> 00:15:26.306]  So we thank you very much for your leadership.
[00:15:29.648 --> 00:15:32.671]  Thank you very, very much.
[00:15:56.889 --> 00:16:02.337]  I want to know why 300 men died, and I have some real questions.
[00:16:02.437 --> 00:16:05.322]  Let's ask some real questions.
[00:16:05.422 --> 00:16:06.263]  Is that unfair?
[00:16:08.306 --> 00:16:11.249]  And what about the bunker?
[00:16:11.369 --> 00:16:15.453]  You didn't ask them about the bunker.
[00:16:15.473 --> 00:16:25.802]  The Office of Emergency Management Bunker was on fire.
[00:16:25.862 --> 00:16:28.664]  We're going to get ready for the next panel shortly.
[00:16:28.784 --> 00:16:32.428]  If you want to be disruptive, you will be removed from this room.
[00:16:36.923 --> 00:16:39.364]  All right, folks.
[00:17:04.555 --> 00:17:06.189]  And then C-SPAN cuts the feed.
[00:17:07.489 --> 00:17:10.630]  And more was said, and this is what we need to have.
[00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:25.035]  Everywhere these criminals go, everywhere this military-industrial complex goes, people that carry this attack out, and I'll just say it because the facts are there, we need to be confronting them in their face, exposing them, marches in every town and city, because they're getting ready to carry out more attacks.
[00:17:25.695 --> 00:17:29.996]  And Christopher Broder brought up all the key points, many of them.
[00:17:30.056 --> 00:17:31.236]  These aren't real questions.
[00:17:31.617 --> 00:17:35.938]  They would ask, why did the White House call the mayor of San Francisco and tell him not to fly to New York the next day?
[00:17:36.696 --> 00:17:37.497]  On September 10th.
[00:17:39.219 --> 00:17:40.220]  These are the type of questions.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:45.705]  Why did you, Mr. Bush, order 160 of the Bin Laden's flown out when all their air traffic was grounded?
[00:17:46.914 --> 00:17:48.755]  There's 600 plus of these questions.
[00:17:48.835 --> 00:17:51.637]  We're about to break, but let's go ahead and bring Christopher Broder up.
[00:17:51.657 --> 00:17:54.960]  Then we're going to break and bring Kyle Hens up, who was also there.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.743]  Christopher, I want to commend you, and I want to thank you for being on our broadcast.
[00:17:59.323 --> 00:18:00.104]  Hello, can you hear me?
[00:18:00.264 --> 00:18:00.804]  Yes, I can.
[00:18:01.084 --> 00:18:02.325]  Oh, well, thanks.
[00:18:02.425 --> 00:18:08.430]  Listening back, that's the first I've actually heard of the full thing, and it sounds like I raised a lot more hell than I remembered.
[00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:15.795]  Well, also, there are some clips where the women are talking about Building 7 and the rest of it,
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.001]  And it's just incredible.
[00:18:18.562 --> 00:18:26.808]  But I want to talk to you about this whitewash commission, and I also want to get into anything else that happened that we missed after C-SPAN cut the feed.
[00:18:27.552 --> 00:18:33.254]  Well, the first question is, am I correct that the entire commission was appointed by Bush, correct?
[00:18:33.314 --> 00:18:34.195]  By Lord Bush, yes.
[00:18:34.395 --> 00:18:39.957]  And you'll notice that all the media reports yesterday about the commission and the hearing, nobody mentions Bush appointed.
[00:18:40.137 --> 00:18:41.838]  Well, they call it independent.
[00:18:41.878 --> 00:18:44.299]  That's like Heinrich Himmler being appointed to run the Nuremberg trials.
[00:18:44.399 --> 00:18:44.799]  Exactly.
[00:18:45.379 --> 00:18:49.621]  The first thing that's a tip-off for everybody is that they all leave that key fact out.
[00:18:49.641 --> 00:18:53.562]  Because if you put that in there, especially here in New York City, if you put Bush appointed, everyone knows what that means.
[00:18:53.682 --> 00:18:55.423]  Oh, that's right, it's a fake commission.
[00:18:56.309 --> 00:18:58.090]  And all the media leaves that fact out.
[00:18:59.111 --> 00:19:01.212]  And I didn't go there to raise hell.
[00:19:01.332 --> 00:19:03.774]  I only went there to see what was going on with my own eyes.
[00:19:03.974 --> 00:19:07.396]  And all it is is a giant worship session, so you got angry.
[00:19:07.656 --> 00:19:08.697]  It was worse than that.
[00:19:08.737 --> 00:19:10.638]  Did you watch it live?
[00:19:10.718 --> 00:19:11.279]  No.
[00:19:11.539 --> 00:19:16.022]  I mean, these guys had months to prepare questions, and they just wanted to say, you did a great job.
[00:19:16.122 --> 00:19:21.265]  Well, they talked to all the whistleblowers behind the scenes, and then they had their goons threaten them later to shut up.
[00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:25.738]  The whole thing was outrageous, and I was biting my lips.
[00:19:25.758 --> 00:19:26.618]  Some people said I was rude.
[00:19:26.718 --> 00:19:27.639]  I waited until the end.
[00:19:27.719 --> 00:19:28.900]  If you heard, that was the end.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:29.901]  They were wrapping up... Rude?
[00:19:29.921 --> 00:19:32.262]  We're talking about the murder of 3,000 people!
[00:19:32.543 --> 00:19:35.004]  Well, I was freaking out at the very beginning.
[00:19:35.024 --> 00:19:39.968]  Giuliani's opening statement, he says, remember, this commission shouldn't be investigating anything but the terrorists.
[00:19:40.008 --> 00:19:41.469]  You know, don't investigate anything.
[00:19:41.509 --> 00:19:42.530]  Stop lifting up rocks.
[00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:44.912]  Don't try and find out what was wrong with the radios.
[00:19:44.952 --> 00:19:45.853]  Don't try and find anything out.
[00:19:45.893 --> 00:19:47.555]  This commission should just blame the terrorists.
[00:19:47.595 --> 00:19:50.518]  Well, sir, the New York Daily News reported the radios didn't malfunction.
[00:19:50.939 --> 00:19:52.500]  They grabbed them under national security.
[00:19:53.181 --> 00:19:54.182]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[00:19:54.302 --> 00:19:56.665]  We'll come right back with Mr. Broder and Mr. Hens as well.
[00:19:57.125 --> 00:19:59.348]  I'm Alex Jones, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:20:01.664 --> 00:20:09.567]  Skyrocketing oil prices, the economy on the brink, the plunging dollar, terrorism, the government spending $1.80 for every dollar it collects.
[00:20:09.887 --> 00:20:15.150]  Never in the history of our country have we faced so many threats to our freedoms, rights, and individual security.
[00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:17.951]  How long can we continue without a fracture occurring?
[00:20:18.071 --> 00:20:23.093]  With the events that recently rocked the elections in Spain, what will happen as we get closer to our own election?
[00:20:23.693 --> 00:20:26.174]  Now is the time to begin preparing for such threats.
[00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:31.217]  Ready Reserve Foods has been helping businesses, government, and individuals for over 32 years.

[00:20:48.167 --> 00:20:49.508]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:21:01.522 --> 00:21:05.063]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[00:21:05.403 --> 00:21:05.723]  Yes.
[00:21:06.023 --> 00:21:10.824]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood, the richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[00:21:10.944 --> 00:21:19.865]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, two ounces of juice have the same nutrition as three pounds of choice garden produce.
[00:21:20.025 --> 00:21:27.727]  The get-up-and-go energy, healing, blood-building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.
[00:21:27.947 --> 00:21:30.167]  Hi, I'm Alan Davison at Monocot Wheatgrass.
[00:21:30.367 --> 00:21:32.988]  Thank you for your support of our labors and of this network.
[00:22:00.512 --> 00:22:01.492]  Is America bankrupt?
[00:22:01.653 --> 00:22:04.214]  Are we on the verge of an all-out economic collapse?
[00:22:04.514 --> 00:22:06.995]  What can be done to protect your family and assets?
[00:22:07.235 --> 00:22:10.296]  What kinds of investments will be able to withstand an economic meltdown?
[00:22:10.436 --> 00:22:12.977]  The problem is it's not always easy to find great solutions.
[00:22:13.117 --> 00:22:16.779]  And during these dangerous economic times, finding the right solution is crucial.
[00:22:16.979 --> 00:22:23.402]  Midas Resources has been a leader in educating people not only about the shaky economic future and its many problems, but also the solutions.

[00:22:56.869 --> 00:22:57.970]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:23:03.012 --> 00:23:08.476]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:23:08.916 --> 00:23:13.139]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:23:13.379 --> 00:23:20.424]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:23:20.805 --> 00:23:26.889]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:23:27.049 --> 00:23:28.250]  There are no side effects.
[00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.910]  We're good to go.
[00:23:45.382 --> 00:23:48.464]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:23:48.484 --> 00:23:48.524]  866-885-6625.
[00:23:48.544 --> 00:23:48.844]  866-885-6625.
[00:23:48.884 --> 00:23:49.804]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:23:49.825 --> 00:23:50.045]  Call today.
[00:23:50.065 --> 00:23:51.585]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:23:51.605 --> 00:23:53.326]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:09.142 --> 00:24:11.206]  Alright, this is the short segment in the shower.
[00:24:11.306 --> 00:24:13.770]  There's another long segment, another short segment coming up.
[00:24:13.851 --> 00:24:17.116]  Plenty of time to get into some detail with our two guests.
[00:24:17.237 --> 00:24:19.421]  Then, in the second hour...
[00:24:20.225 --> 00:24:35.696]  Former Staff Sergeant Jimmy Massey, who has come out and told the Sacramento Bee and the world, I killed innocent people for our government, that William Bunch, Philadelphia Daily News reporter, about the shady intelligence background and the people that Mr. Burke was working with.
[00:24:35.716 --> 00:24:37.057]  That's in the third hour.
[00:24:37.217 --> 00:24:38.758]  I know we've got loaded phones for our guests.
[00:24:38.778 --> 00:24:42.561]  We'll try to take some in about 20 minutes or so, if you want to hold.
[00:24:42.901 --> 00:24:45.223]  Let's go right to our guest, Kyle Hensh.
[00:24:45.723 --> 00:25:03.571]  Co-founder of 9-11 Citizens Watch and contributor to unansweredquestions.org and Christopher Broder, who we're all very impressed with, the guy that stood up and we just played that clip earlier and brought up four or five of the key bullet points to the whitewashers there, the Bush-appointed Kangaroo Commission.
[00:25:04.472 --> 00:25:07.594]  And going now to Kyle Hens, we'll bring you both up.
[00:25:08.474 --> 00:25:09.795]  Kyle, this is a big deal.
[00:25:09.895 --> 00:25:13.677]  You were there, and what was the response of the commission?
[00:25:13.997 --> 00:25:16.318]  How many people were standing up and speaking out?
[00:25:16.879 --> 00:25:25.443]  How many of the victims' family members were angered by this worship session, this caressing session that we were seeing?
[00:25:25.943 --> 00:25:26.984]  Well, it was stunning.
[00:25:27.204 --> 00:25:31.046]  I mean, to me, this represented a sea change in this whole process.
[00:25:31.742 --> 00:25:40.204]  This whole process of the families engaging with the commission, not getting their questions answered, not even getting their questions asked.
[00:25:40.504 --> 00:25:50.307]  They reached a boiling point for them when commissioner after commissioner heaping praise on Mayor Giuliani and not asking the hard questions.
[00:25:50.887 --> 00:25:54.928]  It was like finally the elephant in the room has been acknowledged.
[00:25:55.382 --> 00:25:56.023]  Yes, I think so.
[00:26:12.768 --> 00:26:14.049]  They were flabbergasted.
[00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:30.684]  The net result was at the end of the day, instead of holding a press conference, they issued in block letters a half-page statement saying that Chairman Kaine and Vice Chairman Hamilton will not be holding their press conference and they will be issuing a joint statement.
[00:26:31.483 --> 00:26:38.325]  Now, then I saw Mr. Broder and others, because I did watch part of the commission hearing later on the Internet on C-SPAN.
[00:26:38.425 --> 00:26:40.525]  We have that up on presentplanet.tv.
[00:26:41.145 --> 00:26:43.886]  But, I mean, I saw you guys all getting interviewed.
[00:26:43.906 --> 00:26:45.226]  I didn't see much of it on the news.
[00:26:45.506 --> 00:26:48.447]  They would show you and then say, this is what they said.
[00:26:48.507 --> 00:26:49.867]  Oh, they had a few questions.
[00:26:50.607 --> 00:26:51.307]  I mean, no.
[00:26:52.028 --> 00:26:53.688]  This is a giant cover-up.
[00:26:54.248 --> 00:26:56.409]  Let's bring Mr. Broder in here.
[00:26:57.069 --> 00:26:59.529]  Mr. Broder, I saw all those news cameras around you.
[00:26:59.829 --> 00:27:01.670]  Did anybody carry your statements?
[00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:11.552]  Because the Chicago Tribune and other papers just said, oh, there were a few questions and then basically excised all the real statements that you and some of the victims have brought forward.
[00:27:11.892 --> 00:27:17.394]  Well, it got more press than I would have expected because I'm used to them just burying the truth whenever possible.
[00:27:18.054 --> 00:27:20.594]  Well, they couldn't ignore it, though, because it went out on live television.
[00:27:20.894 --> 00:27:22.015]  The quote, 3,000 murdered, does not
[00:27:23.999 --> 00:27:25.200]  It's not a sign of leadership.
[00:27:25.241 --> 00:27:26.282]  That made it out a number of places.
[00:27:26.382 --> 00:27:30.326]  And the other key point is that it was our government who funded and trained al-Qaeda.
[00:27:30.346 --> 00:27:32.289]  People like to forget that key fact.
[00:27:32.609 --> 00:27:40.218]  But the other key point is that command bunker they built was the command bunker telling people to stay at their stations inside the burning towers.
[00:27:40.698 --> 00:27:42.640]  And it hasn't been brought up.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.883]  Why did Building 7, a steel building, never fell?
[00:27:44.923 --> 00:27:45.684]  Three do that day.
[00:27:45.844 --> 00:27:47.606]  Building 7 isn't hit by an aircraft.
[00:27:48.767 --> 00:27:49.808]  Do you know the true story?
[00:27:49.948 --> 00:27:53.252]  No one has reported the true story about the emergency bunker.
[00:27:53.632 --> 00:28:00.079]  Mayor Giuliani moved it there to line the pockets of Larry Silverstein, who was his largest campaign contributor by sheer coincidence.
[00:28:00.539 --> 00:28:01.040]  We're good to go.
[00:28:10.979 --> 00:28:19.282]  And his buddy, Rudy Giuliani, came to the rescue and took the Emergency Management Center, which was state-of-the-art, out of the basement of one police plaza.
[00:28:19.822 --> 00:28:25.243]  And he moved it from a city-owned building, where it was very safe, into the Twin Towers complex.
[00:28:25.303 --> 00:28:27.344]  But, Mr. Brutter, it's a lot bigger than that.
[00:28:27.364 --> 00:28:31.405]  The firefighters told the Associated Press, get back, we're about to bring down the building.
[00:28:31.705 --> 00:28:35.527]  And Silverstein got on a PBS documentary and said that they blew Building 7 up.
[00:28:35.547 --> 00:28:36.167]  Were you aware of that?
[00:28:37.007 --> 00:28:39.328]  Well, to me, it almost doesn't matter.
[00:28:39.388 --> 00:28:42.969]  Giuliani put the Emergency Management Center in there negligently.
[00:28:43.009 --> 00:28:44.370]  He did it for corrupt reasons.
[00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:47.331]  He now says it was a mistake, but it wasn't.
[00:28:47.691 --> 00:28:51.272]  It was a corrupt maneuver on Giuliani's part to line Silverstein's pocket.
[00:28:51.472 --> 00:28:55.434]  Well, if we can get Al Capone on something smaller than the big event, then that sounds good to me.
[00:28:55.474 --> 00:28:58.075]  But let's go back to Kyle, and then we're about to break.
[00:28:58.115 --> 00:29:00.616]  We'll come back and have more time here and just go over all these issues.
[00:29:01.316 --> 00:29:04.077]  But, Kyle, were you aware of Building 7 and the pulling of the building?
[00:29:04.797 --> 00:29:05.198]  I did.
[00:29:05.278 --> 00:29:13.164]  I've listened to the quote of Silverstein on the NOVA, the PBS special, in which he says, you know, let's pull it.
[00:29:13.204 --> 00:29:15.305]  We've had too much loss of life today.
[00:29:15.646 --> 00:29:23.011]  Let's pull it, which is a term that's used by professionals who conduct demolitions of buildings.
[00:29:23.111 --> 00:29:30.357]  So it certainly raises the specter that, you know, the question, was this in fact rigged for demolition?
[00:29:30.517 --> 00:29:33.059]  Well, how did some small fires make it collapse?
[00:29:33.079 --> 00:29:33.399]  Exactly.
[00:29:35.113 --> 00:29:44.398]  ...by a plane, and this is one of the big, big emerging questions that, quite frankly, you should know that some of the family members are beginning to ask.
[00:29:44.458 --> 00:29:45.019]  Good, good.
[00:29:45.059 --> 00:29:45.479]  Stay there.
[00:29:45.499 --> 00:29:49.461]  I want to talk about what the family members are saying, what happened in that commission meeting.
[00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:50.321]  You guys stay there.
[00:29:51.742 --> 00:29:52.663]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.143 --> 00:29:54.764]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.664 --> 00:29:58.346]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:05.691]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:30:05.931 --> 00:30:11.352]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:30:11.632 --> 00:30:21.995]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:30:22.175 --> 00:30:26.496]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:30:26.696 --> 00:30:35.060]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:30:35.321 --> 00:30:41.624]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul tastes like chlorine and sulfur odor.
[00:30:41.884 --> 00:30:44.585]  All across America, people are using the sun and wind to create enough energy to power their homes.
[00:31:07.461 --> 00:31:12.203]  For over 18 years, these people have trusted Sinalco to help them on the road to energy independence.
[00:31:12.904 --> 00:31:15.585]  Sinalco has systems to meet every need and budget.
[00:31:16.105 --> 00:31:20.507]  Complete home systems using solar, wind, hydroelectric, or hydrogen fuel cells.
[00:31:21.028 --> 00:31:25.610]  With the rise in the cost of electricity, it makes sense to add renewable energy to your home or business.
[00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:30.572]  Many states offer cash rebates and tax breaks to those with renewable energy systems.
[00:31:31.033 --> 00:31:31.453]  It's easy.
[00:31:31.913 --> 00:31:35.875]  Many of Sinalco's systems come packaged for easy installation by the homeowner.
[00:31:36.275 --> 00:31:46.545]  Sunelco has a 106-page Renewable Energy Planning Guide and Catalog available for only $5 containing a detailed study to help anyone understand the how and why of renewable energy.
[00:31:46.986 --> 00:31:48.988]  May just be the best investment you've ever made.
[00:31:49.488 --> 00:31:50.769]  Call Sunelco today at 1-800-338-6844.
[00:31:50.809 --> 00:31:52.311]  That's 800-338-6844 or visit them online at sunelco.com.
[00:32:01.627 --> 00:32:03.988]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:32:04.228 --> 00:32:08.068]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:09.209]  Read the labels.
[00:32:09.629 --> 00:32:13.770]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:18.171]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:32:18.531 --> 00:32:23.412]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:32:23.812 --> 00:32:27.394]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:32:27.574 --> 00:32:32.917]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:32:33.197 --> 00:32:35.918]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:32:36.219 --> 00:32:37.119]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:32:37.419 --> 00:32:48.145]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[00:32:49.969 --> 00:32:50.991]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit calbendpuresoap.com.
[00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:24.240]  Blasting out on the AM and FM dial from Providence Road Island, Pensacola, Florida, Los Angeles, California.
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.543]  Coming to you from Austin, Texas, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:33:27.495 --> 00:33:37.945]  It's almost casting on global shortwave during the day at 94.75 and at night from 9 to midnight at 32.10 and the internet at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:33:37.965 --> 00:33:43.731]  We're fighting the globalists who are using terror to turn this into a prison planet.
[00:33:43.751 --> 00:33:50.338]  We are so honored to have Kyle Hens, co-founder of the 9-11 Citizens Watch and contributor to unansweredquestions.org joining us.
[00:33:51.101 --> 00:33:52.502]  Does amazing investigations.
[00:33:53.063 --> 00:33:54.063]  I'm very aware of his work.
[00:33:54.143 --> 00:34:04.732]  And Christopher Broder, who I just learned of a few days ago, when he boldly stood up, pointed his finger with power and purpose, and on the side of goodness, and told the truth!
[00:34:05.292 --> 00:34:06.393]  This is all facts!
[00:34:06.733 --> 00:34:09.976]  And America needs to stop being in denial.
[00:34:10.216 --> 00:34:18.683]  You're a conspiracy theorist, a crazy conspiracy theorist, to not say the government wasn't involved in this and didn't have prior knowledge at the bare minimum!
[00:34:19.043 --> 00:34:23.766]  He stood up and he told them three times, our government created and funded Al-Qaeda!
[00:34:24.947 --> 00:34:27.329]  They used them to attack the Serbs in 98!
[00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:29.371]  That's the Senate's own 99 report.
[00:34:30.143 --> 00:34:46.115]  Now, Kyle Hens, Christopher Broder, you guys, whatever you think is most important for people to know that we needed to discuss about this meeting, about the family starting to wake up, how this commission was appointed by Lord Bush, how it's a kangaroo court, it isn't being discussed.
[00:34:46.436 --> 00:34:48.277]  I mean, just, gentlemen, you've got the floor.
[00:34:48.637 --> 00:34:49.978]  Well, can I first make one point?
[00:34:50.079 --> 00:34:54.222]  If you notice, like, the New York Times reporting now, if they're the left wing, then Lord help us.
[00:34:54.843 --> 00:35:03.640]  But they spent more ink yesterday in the New York Times writing about what Rudy Giuliani was wearing during the hearing than about what was said by the families.
[00:35:04.533 --> 00:35:05.614]  And that should be a tip-off.
[00:35:06.314 --> 00:35:09.355]  Again, there was a lot of whitewashing, even by the media.
[00:35:09.375 --> 00:35:10.496]  They're all complicit.
[00:35:10.536 --> 00:35:12.236]  Bill Clinton helped protect these people.
[00:35:12.276 --> 00:35:17.379]  This has been a long-term, globalist plan being brought to fruition, and they're all intertwined.
[00:35:17.399 --> 00:35:24.982]  And I want to point out one other important point, because most of my friends are like, Bush is a maniac, and of course he's a maniac, but people don't realize Giuliani...
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.622]  Is old buddies with these guys.
[00:35:27.662 --> 00:35:30.024]  Number three in the Justice Department of Ronald Reagan.
[00:35:30.124 --> 00:35:32.206]  People think Rudy Giuliani is just some heroic mayor.
[00:35:32.586 --> 00:35:40.572]  Even some of my left-wing activist friends think Giuliani is this great man, and they don't realize all the scams he committed before 9-11 on 9-11.
[00:35:40.833 --> 00:35:46.057]  Look, look, look, I've got a whole file of mainstream news of all his mafia connections.
[00:35:46.577 --> 00:35:50.701]  Remember, he tried to cancel the election after September 11th for a new mayor.
[00:35:51.301 --> 00:35:52.562]  He tried to violate term limits.
[00:35:52.862 --> 00:35:53.602]  People don't remember this.
[00:35:53.782 --> 00:36:00.124]  Rudy Giuliani created the Twin Towers Fund, ostensibly to raise money to give to the widows of firemen and the police.
[00:36:00.484 --> 00:36:03.846]  And he then tried to hold onto that money and not give it out to them.
[00:36:03.866 --> 00:36:06.426]  He wanted to extend it for 20 years.
[00:36:06.767 --> 00:36:12.789]  And he was going to hire his girlfriend, Judy Nathan, and all of his other cronies at $200,000 a year salaries.
[00:36:13.029 --> 00:36:16.590]  And he was going to take the money that he raised for the widows... Well, let me add this.
[00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:19.231]  ...and give it to his friends for 20 years...
[00:36:19.571 --> 00:36:22.618]  Elliot Spitzer, New York City's Attorney General, had to stop him.
[00:36:23.099 --> 00:36:26.105]  Well, on top of this, Elliot Spitzer is something else.
[00:36:27.558 --> 00:36:36.565]  On top of all of this, they then told people, sign a form you won't sue, sign an agreement you won't talk about 9-11, then we'll give you this $1.5 million.
[00:36:36.766 --> 00:36:42.370]  They actually tried to use that money people gave as a way to muscle the victims.
[00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:43.971]  Yeah, well, that was Giuliani's M.O.
[00:36:44.011 --> 00:36:49.036]  I mean, he gave hundreds of millions of our tax dollars to every media outlet, every media giant.
[00:36:49.076 --> 00:36:56.862]  Giuliani's had drinks with every media giant in New York City for eight years, and no one's ever going to find out the truth about some of the things Giuliani did.
[00:36:57.541 --> 00:37:00.602]  And that kind of troubles me, because Giuliani will be President of the United States in 2008.
[00:37:00.682 --> 00:37:03.582]  Well, I mean, I can only watch 20, 30 minutes of it.
[00:37:04.323 --> 00:37:07.903]  I watched a little bit live, and then you got ready for my own radio show.
[00:37:08.604 --> 00:37:10.244]  But since then, I've watched more of it.
[00:37:10.304 --> 00:37:11.364]  I mean, it's the whole thing.
[00:37:11.404 --> 00:37:13.005]  I've watched hours of it other days.
[00:37:13.085 --> 00:37:14.385]  It's a giant worship fest.
[00:37:14.405 --> 00:37:15.945]  We need a domestic CIA.
[00:37:16.245 --> 00:37:17.386]  The government did nothing wrong.
[00:37:17.426 --> 00:37:18.206]  We're your God.
[00:37:18.266 --> 00:37:19.046]  Give up your freedom.
[00:37:19.726 --> 00:37:22.607]  But let's go back to the families are starting to wake up.
[00:37:22.668 --> 00:37:27.450]  Christopher Broder, the man who stood up and really gave them the focused attack with the truth.
[00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:29.150]  What are the families starting to say?
[00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:32.972]  Because we heard that giant round of applause three times for you.
[00:37:34.573 --> 00:37:35.974]  Well, you should ask Kyle.
[00:37:35.994 --> 00:37:37.174]  Well, let me just jump in here.
[00:37:37.414 --> 00:37:38.435]  I mean, the families...
[00:37:39.625 --> 00:37:40.827]  You know, they're a diverse group.
[00:37:40.887 --> 00:37:42.429]  I mean, there's thousands of them.
[00:37:42.709 --> 00:37:44.631]  And so you have some diversity.
[00:37:44.671 --> 00:37:49.237]  But let me say that the general drift is they've absolutely had it with this commission.
[00:37:49.657 --> 00:37:51.680]  They're not putting faith in it.
[00:37:52.011 --> 00:37:53.172]  They're giving the benefit of the doubt.
[00:37:53.192 --> 00:37:55.313]  They're sort of waiting for the final report to come out.
[00:37:55.333 --> 00:37:59.514]  But they're already beginning to call for a truly independent commission.
[00:37:59.534 --> 00:38:04.677]  There's no question in my mind whatsoever that the White House exerts control over this commission.
[00:38:04.997 --> 00:38:11.160]  The executive director, the family members who exec Zellickow, they've asked for his resignation.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.541]  He's written a book with Condoleezza Rice.
[00:38:13.581 --> 00:38:14.901]  They appointed the commission.
[00:38:14.941 --> 00:38:17.322]  It's like this appointed governing council in Iraq.
[00:38:17.603 --> 00:38:18.423]  It's not elected.
[00:38:18.643 --> 00:38:20.424]  It's riddled with conflicts of interest.
[00:38:20.504 --> 00:38:21.964]  It's full of consummate insiders.
[00:38:22.204 --> 00:38:27.066]  By the way, Keane, the chairman, is in business with a Bin Laden family member.
[00:38:28.546 --> 00:38:30.127]  He's in business with Amrata Hess.
[00:38:30.187 --> 00:38:38.970]  He's the director of Amrata Hess, who was involved in some, and had some interest in possible building some pipelines down through Afghanistan and bringing some oil to market.
[00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:42.151]  He's also in business with one of Bin Laden's brothers-in-law.
[00:38:42.811 --> 00:38:43.551]  Yes, right.
[00:38:43.571 --> 00:38:44.312]  That may well be.
[00:38:44.912 --> 00:38:48.353]  Anyway, I just want to say that in terms of warnings on the 10th that you had mentioned,
[00:38:48.829 --> 00:39:03.027]  I haven't seen it confirmed at the White House called Willie Brown, but I have confirmed directly with Mark Hosenball at Newsweek, he is standing by the story which ran twice in Newsweek, that top Pentagon brass were warned not to fly on the 11th.
[00:39:03.067 --> 00:39:04.449]  They were warned on the evening of the 10th.
[00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:20.573]  That was MSNBC, but no, it's AP, San Francisco Chronicle, the White House called Mayor Willie Brown the night before and said, somebody from the White House, we know it's Rice, his buddy, you know, on the Arts Commission, called and said, don't fly to New York, and he told the San Francisco Chronicle that.
[00:39:21.013 --> 00:39:23.774]  It wouldn't surprise me if, in fact, it proved out to be Rice.
[00:39:23.794 --> 00:39:29.755]  Well, no, sir, we have that on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com, we have 9-11 sections, we have the mainstream articles.
[00:39:30.855 --> 00:39:33.776]  And I can tell you, it also appeared in Newsweek, and it ran twice.
[00:39:34.409 --> 00:39:37.493]  So it's not like, okay, they made a mistake and then they retracted it.
[00:39:37.793 --> 00:39:42.458]  No, they ran the story of top Pentagon brass being worn the night before.
[00:39:42.698 --> 00:39:50.227]  Also, we have Salman Rushdie, Times of London, banned for the month of September from flying to New York by the FAA for, quote, his safety.
[00:39:50.667 --> 00:39:53.811]  Yes, and I have been getting calls because of the nature of my work.
[00:39:54.298 --> 00:39:59.822]  From people filling me in, giving me anecdotal, relating to me stories.
[00:40:00.023 --> 00:40:10.851]  I have unconfirmed reports that there were numerous airport closings across the country that night, the night of the 10th, and also military bases that went on high alert.
[00:40:11.012 --> 00:40:12.593]  Here's another tidbit that no one's heard.
[00:40:13.534 --> 00:40:23.782]  A former Navy commander that was working at a base in Portland, near Portland, Maine, called me to say that someone who was still in the Navy currently, a Navy commander,
[00:40:24.415 --> 00:40:29.077]  Went on a hiking trip on the 6th of September with three of his friends.
[00:40:29.097 --> 00:40:30.398]  So they piled in the SUV.
[00:40:30.418 --> 00:40:32.258]  They went up north toward the Canadian border.
[00:40:32.278 --> 00:40:33.339]  They did their hiking.
[00:40:33.359 --> 00:40:35.200]  They got in their car to drive back.
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:36.720]  This is on the 9th.
[00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:38.881]  They're 60 miles inside the border.
[00:40:39.621 --> 00:40:45.444]  And they come across this concrete serpentine roadblock on the southbound lane of Route 95.
[00:40:45.544 --> 00:40:48.825]  Again, 60 miles inside the border from Canada in Maine.
[00:40:49.606 --> 00:40:52.087]  And there was an M16 toting vehicle.
[00:40:53.246 --> 00:40:54.146]  I think so.
[00:41:10.982 --> 00:41:11.743]  Wave them through.
[00:41:11.783 --> 00:41:14.045]  So someone alerted someone in Maine.
[00:41:14.426 --> 00:41:15.827]  Well, sir, let me stop you.
[00:41:16.007 --> 00:41:19.791]  At least ten of the CEOs that worked in the towers weren't there.
[00:41:19.851 --> 00:41:28.560]  They were there with Warren Buffett and others at an Air Force base in Nebraska where Bush then stopped that day for some secret meeting.
[00:41:30.001 --> 00:41:30.702]  Were you aware of that?
[00:41:31.568 --> 00:41:35.771]  I had heard about a meeting in a... Moffett Air Force Base.
[00:41:36.171 --> 00:41:37.172]  At an Air Force Base.
[00:41:37.192 --> 00:41:37.912]  Associated Press.
[00:41:37.932 --> 00:41:40.834]  Called by Warren Buffett, yes.
[00:41:40.874 --> 00:41:44.617]  They were all there at 7.30 in the morning, by the way, and then Bush flew in later that afternoon.
[00:41:45.217 --> 00:41:46.418]  What do you make of that?
[00:41:47.859 --> 00:41:59.525]  Well, this is very, very serious information, and are you guys aware of Stanley Hilton, Bob Dole's former chief of staff, who's got hundreds of the victims' families, and he's deposed military officers who said that they were ordered to stand down?
[00:42:00.185 --> 00:42:07.429]  He said on this show that he had inside info that there was a drill on the morning of 9-11 by the CIA of flying hijacked jets in the World Trade Center Pentagon.
[00:42:07.729 --> 00:42:11.151]  We brought that forward on this show two weeks later to get out ahead of the story.
[00:42:11.831 --> 00:42:17.137]  The CIA goes, yeah, we were running a drill that morning, and that was in the Associated Press.
[00:42:17.157 --> 00:42:17.998]  Were you aware of that?
[00:42:18.238 --> 00:42:21.402]  I believe it was the National Reconnaissance Office that was running the drill.
[00:42:21.422 --> 00:42:22.763]  There were three separate drills.
[00:42:23.124 --> 00:42:28.209]  There was another drill five weeks before and another one two years before.
[00:42:28.229 --> 00:42:33.475]  And the NRO was running an exercise, a war game, not a war game, excuse me, an errant commercial jet.
[00:42:34.216 --> 00:42:36.037]  That was a later cover story.
[00:42:36.097 --> 00:42:38.399]  No, the first AP article was what they were actually doing.
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:48.145]  Well, that's because NORAD isn't full of traitors.
[00:42:48.165 --> 00:42:49.827]  They had to tell them, just stand down.
[00:42:49.847 --> 00:42:52.428]  We know Dick Cheney was in the bunker, in control.
[00:42:52.448 --> 00:42:53.929]  Oh, it's just a drill.
[00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:58.072]  Now, let's get more into the families in the commission.
[00:42:58.632 --> 00:42:58.953]  Kyle?
[00:42:59.233 --> 00:42:59.393]  Yes.
[00:43:00.094 --> 00:43:25.852]  I can confirm for you that, you know, speaking at least with one family member who is quite well informed and in contact with many others, that he has serious questions now as a result of independent looking into this issue about what happened in Building 7, which there were some small fires, there's a couple of different floors, and, you know, some, what, five hours of
[00:43:27.435 --> 00:43:37.783]  Five or five, five and a half, six hours after the Twin Towers came down, Building 7 collapsed, and there's been no definitive explanation.
[00:43:38.224 --> 00:43:40.766]  There's a pending investigation.
[00:43:40.806 --> 00:43:53.316]  This is a current issue, people, so you can put some pressure on the government on why it is and how it could be that that building came down because NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is right now, as we speak,
[00:43:54.175 --> 00:43:58.958]  Funded to the tune of, I think, $16 million, something in that neighborhood.
[00:43:58.978 --> 00:44:00.859]  They're going to create a giant whitewash report.
[00:44:01.119 --> 00:44:15.467]  Of course they are, but every time they meet Alex in public, and they've opened up to some public scrutiny, is a chance to raise this issue in public, in front of the press, and make some noise.
[00:44:15.527 --> 00:44:19.749]  I'm not saying they're going to get to the bottom of it, but every time that they stick their head up,
[00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:24.060]  It's a chance for us to exercise our vigilance and be vigilant.
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.263]  I have another question.
[00:44:25.324 --> 00:44:26.707]  How do you get into these meetings?
[00:44:27.583 --> 00:44:28.463]  It's open to the public.
[00:44:28.623 --> 00:44:30.324]  But I know, but it fills up at a certain point.
[00:44:30.344 --> 00:44:31.064]  You just get there early.
[00:44:31.084 --> 00:44:31.745]  You get there early.
[00:44:32.165 --> 00:44:32.985]  You get there early.
[00:44:33.005 --> 00:44:33.465]  I lucked out.
[00:44:33.565 --> 00:44:43.690]  Usually Giuliani's people spot me and they make sure I'm not allowed into any room where he is because I've disrupted lots of his things before because he has a bad habit of lying and no one double-checks any of his information.
[00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:45.530]  Can I digress for a moment here?
[00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:45.650]  Sure.
[00:44:46.031 --> 00:44:52.253]  What are we going to do to prevent... I'm kind of curious because I'm assuming, like many people, that there's going to be some major terrorist act right before the election.
[00:44:52.273 --> 00:44:53.214]  The White House told U.S.
[00:44:53.234 --> 00:44:54.234]  News & World Report...
[00:44:54.574 --> 00:44:55.436]  It is going to happen.
[00:44:55.456 --> 00:44:59.963]  They say the Capitol will be destroyed, number one, or there will be massive attacks coast to coast.
[00:45:00.203 --> 00:45:01.505]  Who stands to gain from that?
[00:45:01.866 --> 00:45:02.968]  What can we do to stop that?
[00:45:03.866 --> 00:45:07.487]  We have to expose who's behind 9-11, and I'll just say it right on the air.
[00:45:07.807 --> 00:45:10.288]  The military industrial complex carried the whole attack out.
[00:45:10.668 --> 00:45:12.809]  At least seven of the hijackers are still alive.
[00:45:13.089 --> 00:45:14.109]  The others were trained at U.S.
[00:45:14.169 --> 00:45:14.989]  military bases.
[00:45:15.009 --> 00:45:18.911]  They have their cars and homes and credit cards paid for by the FBI.
[00:45:19.411 --> 00:45:24.492]  The government staged the Afghan war, flew 8,000 Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders out in the middle of it.
[00:45:24.812 --> 00:45:25.793]  That was all staged.
[00:45:25.833 --> 00:45:27.293]  The CIA insider trading.
[00:45:27.793 --> 00:45:32.995]  The PNAC documents calling for terror attacks to be helpful to get us behind imperial mobilization.
[00:45:33.395 --> 00:45:33.575]  I mean...
[00:45:33.955 --> 00:45:38.598]  We've got to come right out with the fact that giving up our liberties doesn't make us safe.
[00:45:38.798 --> 00:45:39.639]  No, it doesn't, Alex.
[00:45:39.739 --> 00:45:45.342]  May I make a plug for a book that I think raises the questions in a way and builds a case?
[00:45:45.662 --> 00:45:46.243]  Sure.
[00:45:46.683 --> 00:45:52.206]  I'd like to put a plug in for a book called The New Pearl Harbor by David Ray Griffin.
[00:45:52.246 --> 00:45:58.030]  This man is a top theologian, a systematic theologian, a professor for many, many years, decades.
[00:45:58.550 --> 00:45:59.391]  He's published 20 books.
[00:46:01.085 --> 00:46:05.449]  It's called The New Pearl Harbor, Disturbing Questions About the Bush Administration in 9-11.
[00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:13.697]  The foreword was written by Richard Falk, human rights lawyer and professor emeritus at Princeton University, who said, quote, this is an extraordinary book.
[00:46:13.817 --> 00:46:18.782]  It is rare indeed that a book has this potential to become a force of history.
[00:46:19.263 --> 00:46:20.965]  Sir, did you know that on race...
[00:46:21.305 --> 00:46:22.186]  I'm going to respond to you, though.
[00:46:22.226 --> 00:46:30.432]  The former German defense minister in the parliament and the former technology minister says that the government either had total prior knowledge or carried it out.
[00:46:30.732 --> 00:46:35.416]  Michael Meacher, the British environment minister, resigned and wrote an eight-page editorial saying this.
[00:46:35.456 --> 00:46:37.137]  Are you aware of all those people coming forward?
[00:46:38.078 --> 00:46:38.398]  Am I?
[00:46:38.498 --> 00:46:38.798]  Yes.
[00:46:38.918 --> 00:46:40.559]  I have read their work.
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:41.220]  Absolutely.
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:42.261]  Absolutely.
[00:46:42.421 --> 00:46:46.404]  We posted his whole article on 911citizenswatch.org where...
[00:46:46.977 --> 00:46:56.041]  You know, we've got a list of resources and some links, and most of our work has been focused on trying to expose the farce of this investigation and the conflicts of interest.
[00:46:56.221 --> 00:46:57.321]  It isn't an investigation.
[00:46:57.361 --> 00:47:03.204]  It's there to find out who knows what so they can have goons shut them up later and to make the general public think there has been an investigation.
[00:47:03.244 --> 00:47:04.084]  Well, I know one thing.
[00:47:04.104 --> 00:47:08.386]  They're trying to shut up Sabelle Edmonds, the whistleblower who worked with the FBI shortly after 9-11.
[00:47:08.446 --> 00:47:09.907]  Yeah, you yelled that at them.
[00:47:09.927 --> 00:47:12.848]  You said, why are you going after the whistleblowers?
[00:47:13.308 --> 00:47:15.229]  That's right, and they are going after the whistleblowers.
[00:47:15.269 --> 00:47:24.932]  Well, I yelled out, I yelled out, just, I yelled out, arrest the whistleblowers, because they were intending to arrest me, and they were going to get rid of anybody else who criticized the commission during the actual hearing.
[00:47:24.952 --> 00:47:26.932]  They have been threatening to arrest Edmonds.
[00:47:27.673 --> 00:47:29.173]  And so, that was my point.
[00:47:29.413 --> 00:47:34.235]  Wait, can you guys answer this question, because I don't have all the answers, but I know so much dirt about what Giuliani did on 9-11.
[00:47:35.205 --> 00:47:36.026]  You know how they melted?
[00:47:36.066 --> 00:47:37.327]  He shipped off the steel.
[00:47:37.687 --> 00:47:39.569]  All the steel, well, as much of the steel as he could.
[00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:43.732]  And the firefighter said that that was destroying a crime scene, that that was criminal, that a fire couldn't bring that down.
[00:47:43.993 --> 00:47:51.619]  And so, do you guys think, I mean, the steel was not only sent off and melted down, but Julian's people said, we didn't know that people wanted to save.
[00:47:51.639 --> 00:47:54.321]  The victims' families had to testify in front of Congress and FEMA.
[00:47:54.642 --> 00:47:56.243]  Well, you don't destroy a crime scene.
[00:47:56.263 --> 00:47:59.586]  They rushed in, wouldn't let people take photos, hauled it all away.
[00:48:00.368 --> 00:48:04.570]  And do you think, though, that that's because there was something more than just fire in the Twin Towers?
[00:48:04.650 --> 00:48:05.350]  Oh, come on.
[00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:08.472]  I mean, the seismographs, the explosions going off down the sides.
[00:48:08.692 --> 00:48:11.433]  I've talked to the firefighters who saw the bombs going off.
[00:48:12.193 --> 00:48:12.474]  Wow.
[00:48:12.814 --> 00:48:18.876]  Yeah, there's a lot of anecdotal evidence that, you know, we don't have the smoking gun because we weren't able to take a swath.
[00:48:19.497 --> 00:48:23.479]  We have the firefighters telling AP reporters, get back, we're about to bring down the building.
[00:48:24.239 --> 00:48:26.600]  That's Building 7, but in case of the towers...
[00:48:27.085 --> 00:48:27.986]  There's anecdotal evidence.
[00:48:28.006 --> 00:48:38.335]  There was a gentleman who was in Vietnam that worked with C4, and he was running away from the buildings when they started to come down, and he heard these explosions and saw white smokes.
[00:48:38.836 --> 00:48:43.620]  Yeah, there were white explosion points going off at every level where the floors are at.
[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:46.022]  Yeah, there's a lot of anecdotal stuff.
[00:48:46.182 --> 00:48:50.286]  And, in fact, Citizens Watch held a press conference on March 22nd of this year
[00:48:50.925 --> 00:48:52.546]  It was covered live by C-SPAN.
[00:48:52.586 --> 00:48:53.807]  We raised some of these questions.
[00:48:53.847 --> 00:48:59.512]  We put out this book and showed the book to the press and so on.
[00:48:59.812 --> 00:49:13.984]  But at that conference, a gentleman named William Rodriguez, who spent 20 years sweeping the stairwell of one of the World Trade Center towers, and he said that he survived the attacks and was leading some of the firemen up the stairs.
[00:49:14.444 --> 00:49:19.268]  And when he reached the 32nd floor of, I can't remember if it was the North or South Tower,
[00:49:20.032 --> 00:49:20.472]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:49:36.187 --> 00:49:37.788]  Again, it's just another anomaly.
[00:49:37.868 --> 00:49:42.691]  Well, they also evacuated the buildings, quote, for some drills a few days before and shut down some floors.
[00:49:43.271 --> 00:49:44.952]  William, I talked to William about that.
[00:49:44.972 --> 00:49:50.055]  He said it's a matter of course, three times a year they do shut down the electricity in parts of the building.
[00:49:50.495 --> 00:49:55.838]  It's a matter of standard... But it was in the mainstream news that there were all these weird people in there.
[00:49:57.463 --> 00:49:58.584]  Well, here's another.
[00:49:58.704 --> 00:49:59.804]  Again, this is unconfirmed.
[00:49:59.844 --> 00:50:01.305]  There's a lot of stuff that's confirmed.
[00:50:01.325 --> 00:50:09.328]  You can go to the 9-11 timeline at cooperativeresearch.org, see all of the mainstream press articles that account a lot of the things we're talking about here.
[00:50:09.769 --> 00:50:12.450]  But I grant you some of the stuff I'm talking about is unconfirmed.
[00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:21.774]  There's another story that was related to me by a former employee of the United Nations who has a friend who was a cop.
[00:50:22.384 --> 00:50:29.507]  In the towers, it said at 7.30, very early in the morning, there was some kind of alarm or some kind of problem in one of the towers.
[00:50:29.567 --> 00:50:30.887]  No, no, that's been in the news, sir.
[00:50:30.927 --> 00:50:33.148]  You guys, there's just so much evidence you've missed some of it.
[00:50:33.628 --> 00:50:34.429]  Yeah, I'm sure of it.
[00:50:34.529 --> 00:50:35.989]  I'm sure I've missed all kinds of stuff.
[00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:39.190]  In this case, there was some firefighters that came in at 7.30 that morning.
[00:50:41.347 --> 00:50:46.214]  And a couple of them managed to get past these cops, but they look somewhat suspicious.
[00:50:46.274 --> 00:50:48.196]  These two cops, three cops stopped them.
[00:50:48.577 --> 00:50:49.438]  They were questioned.
[00:50:49.759 --> 00:50:51.241]  There's probably a press report.
[00:50:51.361 --> 00:50:55.046]  Tell you what, gentlemen, both of you, Mr. Hens, Mr. Brothers, stay there.
[00:50:55.066 --> 00:50:57.749]  We're going to come back, get more into this, maybe take a few calls.
[00:50:57.769 --> 00:50:58.110]  Stay with us.
[00:51:03.092 --> 00:51:09.001]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:51:09.241 --> 00:51:11.504]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:51:11.685 --> 00:51:18.054]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:51:18.374 --> 00:51:19.035]  We're good to go.
[00:51:47.893 --> 00:51:50.994]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:51:51.154 --> 00:51:57.115]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:52:00.656 --> 00:52:04.997]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:52:05.177 --> 00:52:09.618]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:52:09.758 --> 00:52:10.958]  There is a chance.
[00:52:11.522 --> 00:52:14.123]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:52:14.163 --> 00:52:17.024]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:52:17.304 --> 00:52:21.525]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:52:21.585 --> 00:52:28.507]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:52:28.647 --> 00:52:30.648]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:52:30.908 --> 00:52:41.352]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:52:41.632 --> 00:52:47.034]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:52:47.514 --> 00:52:50.135]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:52:50.155 --> 00:52:50.735]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:52:50.775 --> 00:52:51.275]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:52:51.295 --> 00:52:52.576]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:53:00.245 --> 00:53:00.845]  Hello, folks.
[00:53:00.945 --> 00:53:01.866]  Alex Jones here.
[00:53:01.986 --> 00:53:06.107]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:53:06.228 --> 00:53:09.129]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:53:09.189 --> 00:53:15.912]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:19.093]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:53:19.313 --> 00:53:21.694]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:53:21.834 --> 00:53:26.556]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[00:53:26.716 --> 00:53:27.196]  We're good to go.
[00:53:51.946 --> 00:53:52.366]  888-803-4438.
[00:53:52.426 --> 00:53:54.948]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:53:55.088 --> 00:53:58.049]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:53:58.069 --> 00:54:11.918]  All right, I want to keep our guests, if we can, five minutes into the next hour.
[00:54:11.958 --> 00:54:13.499]  We've got another guest coming up.
[00:54:13.839 --> 00:54:14.960]  Very serious issue.
[00:54:17.189 --> 00:54:19.913]  I'm trying to go to Mike in Washington and a few others for our guests.
[00:54:19.933 --> 00:54:21.615]  A bunch of callers called in on other issues.
[00:54:21.635 --> 00:54:22.777]  We can't go to you right now.
[00:54:24.018 --> 00:54:25.961]  But we'll go to Mike in Washington here in just a second.
[00:54:25.981 --> 00:54:33.571]  Before we go back to our guests, and obviously you'll have to have them back up again in the future, and we're having some of the widows, trying to get some of the widows on next week, and others.
[00:54:34.401 --> 00:54:35.703]  But this is very serious.
[00:54:35.743 --> 00:54:39.326]  We need good people standing up saying, no, we're not buying your fraud.
[00:54:39.346 --> 00:54:40.708]  We're not buying your whitewash.
[00:54:41.108 --> 00:54:44.571]  We're not going to have, you know, Herman Goering investigating Hitler here.
[00:54:45.192 --> 00:54:45.973]  This is a fraud.
[00:54:46.073 --> 00:54:51.899]  And if you want to help expose the fraud, get my video, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, two and a half hours long.
[00:54:53.129 --> 00:54:54.750]  Oh, the DVD's almost three hours long.
[00:54:55.191 --> 00:54:59.254]  Detailing the history of government-sponsored terror and what really happened on September 11th.
[00:54:59.574 --> 00:55:00.174]  The facts.
[00:55:00.294 --> 00:55:02.136]  Almost everyone that watches this wakes up.
[00:55:02.476 --> 00:55:05.098]  You're authorized to make copies of my videos, okay?
[00:55:05.498 --> 00:55:08.320]  I just want you to get 9-11, The Road to Terror, and you get part two of that.
[00:55:08.601 --> 00:55:11.683]  The Masters of Terror goes into 9-11 with all the other evidence.
[00:55:12.143 --> 00:55:12.624]  We're good to go.
[00:55:12.644 --> 00:55:13.184]  We're good to go.
[00:55:36.074 --> 00:55:36.394]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:55:36.555 --> 00:55:38.896]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:55:38.916 --> 00:55:51.666]  Or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:55:53.127 --> 00:56:01.774]  Help us expose who was really behind this, or the globalists are going to continue to carry out more terror attacks to scare us into submission in this war for global empire.
[00:56:02.498 --> 00:56:07.340]  The future of this country and your family depends on the truth getting out, and I hope you'll follow these people around.
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:11.181]  Everywhere they go, in your city or town, confront everybody about this.
[00:56:11.241 --> 00:56:16.163]  This is the number one issue, exposing who carried out 9-11 and who stands to gain from it.
[00:56:16.463 --> 00:56:24.886]  Going back to Kyle Hens, co-founder of 9-11 Citizens Watch, and of course Christopher Broder, who stood up and eloquently exposed these liars.
[00:56:25.706 --> 00:56:31.828]  Gentlemen, I want to break, come back in a final segment with you and take a few calls, but right now, any other key information you want to cover?
[00:56:33.186 --> 00:56:36.667]  Well, I focus more on the problems here in New York City.
[00:56:36.887 --> 00:56:38.488]  I should get a copy of your video.
[00:56:38.948 --> 00:56:39.628]  It sounds great.
[00:56:40.109 --> 00:56:46.771]  All I know is that here in New York City, I kind of focus on the Giuliani cover-ups, because the Bush thing is a little too big for me.
[00:56:48.372 --> 00:56:50.612]  And it sounds like you're kind of covering that.
[00:56:52.372 --> 00:56:57.173]  The scandals by Giuliani are endless, but I'm not sure that you're that interested in Giuliani.
[00:56:57.193 --> 00:56:57.813]  No, it's important.
[00:56:57.833 --> 00:56:59.614]  He's kind of a minor character right now.
[00:56:59.634 --> 00:57:02.114]  Well, he's an important minion, though, and that's why they worship him.
[00:57:02.134 --> 00:57:04.335]  Kyle, any other key points?
[00:57:04.655 --> 00:57:15.677]  I just want to say that I felt that yesterday, two days ago, when so many people spoke out, and it shattered the facade of this commission.
[00:57:15.737 --> 00:57:21.879]  Whatever credibility that it might have had with a lot of the family members or those who were watching, it was like the ice was...
[00:57:24.019 --> 00:57:27.901]  It's like the four-year-old going the emperor's neck and he has no clothes.
[00:57:28.722 --> 00:57:29.202]  Exactly.
[00:57:29.222 --> 00:57:30.743]  That's another very good analogy.
[00:57:30.943 --> 00:57:35.967]  I just think that's a very positive sign and that we have got to shift money.
[00:57:35.987 --> 00:57:39.729]  We've got to shift the money out of the systems that perpetuate...
[00:57:40.481 --> 00:57:43.202]  The things that go on in the shadows in this government.
[00:57:43.503 --> 00:57:49.506]  Until we shift the money... And that's what Homeland Security is all about, is feeding the whole economy through these people in government.
[00:57:49.526 --> 00:57:49.946]  Of course it is.
[00:57:49.986 --> 00:57:59.791]  And until we bring control and autonomy back to our communities, our neighborhoods, our regions, and keep the money at home so that it doesn't get sucked out...
[00:58:00.191 --> 00:58:04.314]  By the Walmarts of the world, we're not going to have control of our lives.
[00:58:04.334 --> 00:58:06.095]  It's got to begin in our backyards.
[00:58:06.135 --> 00:58:06.535]  That's right.
[00:58:06.555 --> 00:58:10.898]  The power is locally, not the skull and bones election between Kerry and Bush.
[00:58:11.819 --> 00:58:13.200]  Listen, there's no question about it.
[00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:17.202]  Until we get control of the money, the power will reside outside.
[00:58:17.242 --> 00:58:19.144]  There's increasing centralization.
[00:58:19.164 --> 00:58:21.305]  I just want to look at the big picture for just a heartbeat here.
[00:58:21.724 --> 00:58:23.385]  There's a centralization going on.
[00:58:23.426 --> 00:58:24.246]  You're well aware of it.
[00:58:24.286 --> 00:58:24.647]  I know that.
[00:58:24.687 --> 00:58:25.667]  I'm sure your listeners are.
[00:58:25.948 --> 00:58:33.434]  But we've got to figure out positive steps that citizenry can take in terms of vigilance and calling for transparency and accountability.
[00:58:33.474 --> 00:58:33.734]  Yes.
[00:58:34.055 --> 00:58:36.577]  But we've got to vote with our pocketbooks.
[00:58:36.917 --> 00:58:45.224]  Vote with the dollar and shift out of investing in the places that created the problems we're facing and into the... Incredible.
[00:58:45.244 --> 00:58:45.825]  Incredible.
[00:58:45.885 --> 00:58:46.505]  We've got to break.
[00:58:46.545 --> 00:58:47.786]  Gentlemen, stay right there.
[00:58:48.207 --> 00:58:48.667]  Stay with us.
[00:58:48.707 --> 00:58:49.468]  We'll be back in one minute.
[00:58:51.906 --> 00:59:00.529]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling clean water possible.
[00:59:00.749 --> 00:59:11.993]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:59:12.233 --> 00:59:12.593]  I think.
[00:59:36.192 --> 00:59:40.114]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:59:40.134 --> 00:59:40.854]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:59:40.874 --> 00:59:41.915]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:59:42.075 --> 00:59:42.375]  Big Brother.
[00:59:42.395 --> 00:59:43.496]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:43.536 --> 00:59:44.396]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:44.476 --> 00:59:44.896]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.728 --> 01:00:05.609]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.629 --> 01:00:10.251]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.471 --> 01:00:14.594]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.834 --> 01:00:18.896]  Defending liberty, resisting tyranny.
[01:00:19.096 --> 01:00:22.458]  We're now into our number two for stations that just joined us.
[01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:28.702]  We've been talking to Christopher Broder, the man who stood up and said our government created and funded Al-Qaeda.
[01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:30.981]  Building 7, cover up.
[01:00:31.362 --> 01:00:33.364]  Stop trying to arrest the whistleblowers.
[01:00:33.404 --> 01:00:40.491]  We also have another man who was there, Kyle Hens, co-founder of 9-11 Citizens Watch and contributor to unansweredquestions.org.
[01:00:41.272 --> 01:00:43.774]  And I want to try to take a few calls here for you gentlemen.
[01:00:44.955 --> 01:00:45.856]  They're absolutely right.
[01:00:45.896 --> 01:00:53.741]  This is the emperor has no clothes, breaking the ice, piercing the veil, letting the light in, the vampire scurrying away.
[01:00:54.361 --> 01:00:56.203]  This commission was appointed by Bush.
[01:00:56.243 --> 01:01:01.166]  It's like Janet Reno appointing Senator Danforth to investigate Waco, calling it independent.
[01:01:01.486 --> 01:01:02.427]  This is a joke.
[01:01:02.547 --> 01:01:03.608]  This is a fraud.
[01:01:03.848 --> 01:01:10.372]  This is the number one issue to expose this military-industrial complex and how they're carrying out the attacks to scare us into submission.
[01:01:10.672 --> 01:01:12.173]  Let's talk to Mike in Washington.
[01:01:12.213 --> 01:01:14.555]  Mike, you're on the air with Christopher Broder and Kyle Hens.
[01:01:15.576 --> 01:01:16.037]  Good morning.
[01:01:16.517 --> 01:01:17.038]  Hello, Mike.
[01:01:17.078 --> 01:01:17.499]  Go ahead.
[01:01:17.819 --> 01:01:18.680]  Hello, Kyle.
[01:01:18.741 --> 01:01:26.231]  Christopher, I would like to commend you personally for the particular fortitude you had to stand up to those thugs yesterday.
[01:01:26.251 --> 01:01:27.393]  Or the other day.
[01:01:27.413 --> 01:01:28.714]  I heard the tape and...
[01:01:29.491 --> 01:01:30.152]  I don't know.
[01:01:30.512 --> 01:01:31.133]  It really moved me.
[01:01:31.193 --> 01:01:39.922]  I think what you did is a domino effect, and it's going to start something that will create, every time these creatures get up and lie to us, it'll create something for everyone else to have the opportunity.
[01:01:39.942 --> 01:01:43.486]  Well, Ashcroft was in Detroit a few months ago, and people stood up and said the same thing.
[01:01:43.526 --> 01:01:44.627]  It's happening more and more.
[01:01:45.007 --> 01:01:47.850]  Usually the media covers it up, because this was live on TV.
[01:01:48.131 --> 01:01:48.892]  Millions saw it.
[01:01:48.912 --> 01:01:49.873]  They had to try to spin it.
[01:01:50.093 --> 01:01:50.894]  Gentlemen, comments?
[01:01:51.834 --> 01:01:53.575]  Well, thanks, I guess.
[01:01:53.815 --> 01:01:56.377]  I don't think... I mean, I didn't go there to raise hell.
[01:01:56.437 --> 01:02:01.639]  I went there to be quiet, but what I saw was the most horrendous thing I've ever witnessed, the biggest whitewash I've ever saw.
[01:02:01.659 --> 01:02:03.440]  A worship session.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:06.642]  But I think more Americans have to stand up to their government.
[01:02:06.682 --> 01:02:08.203]  The media's not going to do it for us.
[01:02:08.243 --> 01:02:09.683]  People think there's checks and balances.
[01:02:09.703 --> 01:02:11.504]  There are no checks and balances in the system.
[01:02:11.624 --> 01:02:13.705]  The military-industrial complex owns the media.
[01:02:13.986 --> 01:02:18.388]  Yes, and so what I do is I try to encourage all my fellow citizens to, one...
[01:02:19.045 --> 01:02:21.947]  Yeah, there's more of us than there are of them, and if good people stand up, evil will fail.
[01:02:21.967 --> 01:02:24.209]  But when we do nothing, evil triumphs.
[01:02:24.229 --> 01:02:24.789]  Kyle, any comments?
[01:02:43.265 --> 01:02:44.206]  I am in agreement.
[01:02:44.226 --> 01:02:47.427]  It's our responsibility to stand up and speak out.
[01:02:47.447 --> 01:02:55.530]  Without vigilance, without transparency, there is no way that we have any chance of realizing the ideals of our founding fathers.
[01:02:55.550 --> 01:02:57.431]  And they're telling us give up liberty for security.
[01:02:57.451 --> 01:03:00.152]  When you give up liberty, you get slavery and tyranny and despotism.
[01:03:00.613 --> 01:03:02.433]  Anything else, Mike, in Washington?
[01:03:02.633 --> 01:03:06.835]  Yeah, I'm just really fed up with getting unquestioned answers from this panel.
[01:03:07.755 --> 01:03:08.916]  Or unanswered questions.
[01:03:08.936 --> 01:03:09.856]  No, unquestioned answers.
[01:03:12.248 --> 01:03:14.109]  That's good stuff that we don't even want to know.
[01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:15.851]  Well, it's just, oh, we're good.
[01:03:15.871 --> 01:03:18.673]  The CIA needs to run your life.
[01:03:19.113 --> 01:03:21.575]  Oh, you're such a good... No one in government did anything wrong.
[01:03:21.795 --> 01:03:27.499]  And then they have these secret meetings with whistleblowers and then tell Ashcroft what they said and Ashcroft goes and threatens to arrest them.
[01:03:28.345 --> 01:03:36.273]  Exactly, and it's just time that everyone stands up and we wake up everyone to the fact of what's going on and stop this tyranny before it gets worse.
[01:03:36.413 --> 01:03:37.614]  Okay, thanks for the call, Mike.
[01:03:37.734 --> 01:03:38.835]  We don't have any time for other callers.
[01:03:38.855 --> 01:03:42.599]  We'll get to others later with the next guest, but I do want to bring up this last question to you guys.
[01:03:42.899 --> 01:03:46.723]  Are they going to have more of these whitewash meetings, or is this going to stop them?
[01:03:47.243 --> 01:03:53.189]  There is, and I just want to correct for the record, I was actually co-founder of unansweryourquestions.org, not just a contributor.
[01:03:53.209 --> 01:03:53.489]  Good.
[01:03:53.649 --> 01:03:58.594]  You actually had me on just right after the conference that we did when we launched in June of 2002.
[01:03:59.554 --> 01:03:59.775]  Yes.
[01:04:00.095 --> 01:04:03.858]  There is a planned hearing scheduled currently for June 8th and 9th.
[01:04:05.063 --> 01:04:06.283]  In Washington, D.C.
[01:04:06.724 --> 01:04:13.846]  They may move that back a week, but that could be the most important hearing.
[01:04:13.886 --> 01:04:14.506]  You know what?
[01:04:14.546 --> 01:04:23.669]  I think we need a demonstration in Washington against this commission while you guys are getting inside to confront them.
[01:04:23.789 --> 01:04:24.869]  I believe that that's the case.
[01:04:24.889 --> 01:04:28.110]  It would be great to see people on the streets with signs raising the questions.
[01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:29.811]  Again, give folks that date.
[01:04:31.007 --> 01:04:33.348]  Now, again, this is not carved in granite.
[01:04:33.368 --> 01:04:38.270]  You'll have to keep an eye on 9-11commission.gov for the change of date.
[01:04:38.290 --> 01:04:41.431]  There is one, but it's currently scheduled June 8th and 9th.
[01:04:41.451 --> 01:04:42.852]  This is the most important yet.
[01:04:43.092 --> 01:04:46.993]  They're supposed to focus on the NORAD and FAA questions.
[01:04:47.473 --> 01:04:49.234]  Gentlemen, gentlemen, God bless you both.
[01:04:49.534 --> 01:04:50.654]  We'll have you both back on.
[01:04:50.694 --> 01:04:51.155]  Take care.
[01:04:51.335 --> 01:04:51.715]  Thank you.
[01:04:51.815 --> 01:04:52.155]  Thank you.
[01:04:53.738 --> 01:05:00.540]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:02.240]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.641]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:05:04.781 --> 01:05:06.881]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:05:07.142 --> 01:05:12.083]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:05:12.423 --> 01:05:16.444]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:05:16.704 --> 01:05:18.485]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:05:18.545 --> 01:05:29.208]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.348 --> 01:05:31.248]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:05:31.468 --> 01:05:35.330]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[01:05:35.410 --> 01:05:36.850]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:37.070]  That's 888-2533-139.
[01:05:43.932 --> 01:05:45.154]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[01:05:53.075 --> 01:05:53.856]  Terrorism.
[01:05:53.996 --> 01:05:54.756]  Terrorism.
[01:05:54.856 --> 01:05:55.677]  Chemical attacks.
[01:05:55.757 --> 01:05:56.418]  Dirty bombs.
[01:05:56.518 --> 01:05:56.938]  Fallout.
[01:05:57.018 --> 01:05:58.019]  Biological attack.
[01:05:58.199 --> 01:05:58.719]  Anthrax.
[01:05:58.799 --> 01:06:00.901]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:06:01.181 --> 01:06:02.763]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:06:03.003 --> 01:06:05.485]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:06:05.885 --> 01:06:20.456]  The video, Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:06:20.496 --> 01:06:20.816]  government.
[01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:22.778]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:06:23.138 --> 01:06:29.061]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:06:29.201 --> 01:06:33.704]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[01:06:33.944 --> 01:06:40.668]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:06:40.728 --> 01:06:43.369]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:06:52.324 --> 01:06:57.827]  Old timers remember a time when things were a bit slower, and most folks really did take the time to stop and smell the roses.
[01:06:58.087 --> 01:07:03.650]  That was back when gardeners grew tomatoes that tasted like tomato, and watermelons that tasted like watermelon was supposed to.
[01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:06.211]  Sweet corn that was real sweet sweet corn.
[01:07:06.371 --> 01:07:07.412]  Well, you get the idea.
[01:07:07.592 --> 01:07:17.477]  Too bad the big seed companies became big greed companies, and decided that hybrids grown in hothouses, artificially ripened with gas, could be grown much quicker, fetching more money at the large grocery stores.
[01:07:17.777 --> 01:07:27.285]  Folks at the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company remember that simpler time and are proud to be offering non-GMO heirloom seeds to gardeners who value flavor and variety over speed and greed.
[01:07:27.485 --> 01:07:36.632]  There's seed for fruits and vegetables of all kinds, seed for flowers and herbs, annuals and perennials, and some great books written by experts in the field to help get you started on the road to success.
[01:07:36.932 --> 01:07:37.232]  Big Brother.
[01:07:37.272 --> 01:07:38.153]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:38.173 --> 01:07:38.653]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:38.693 --> 01:07:39.534]  You want answers?
[01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:05.711]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:05.731 --> 01:08:10.094]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.574 --> 01:08:14.697]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:17.879 --> 01:08:22.182]  Blasting out coast to coast on a growing number of wonderful AM and FM affiliates.
[01:08:23.403 --> 01:08:25.885]  Some will cast in the global shortwave during the day from 11 to 2 central.
[01:08:25.905 --> 01:08:26.606]  At 94.75, WWCR, the global...
[01:08:30.686 --> 01:08:33.349]  Below Torch, at night from 9 to midnight Central, 3210.
[01:08:33.389 --> 01:08:38.633]  The websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[01:08:38.653 --> 01:08:50.124]  I remember about a year and a half ago, a private Bruckheimer bragged in the Ithaca Journal in New York about they were ordered to go into villages and kill every man, woman, child, baby.
[01:08:50.384 --> 01:08:55.389]  He was quoted, and the Pentagon clarified and said, well, yes, in some areas of the hostiles, we kill everyone.
[01:08:56.519 --> 01:08:58.620]  So their clarification was just as bad.
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:01.160]  This was a confirmed statement.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:10.363]  We have the images of them beating people to death in these bases, under orders, by the way, but they're just imprisoning a few people who followed orders, and that doesn't absolve them.
[01:09:11.863 --> 01:09:19.345]  We've played the audio off PBS where they find guys stealing three sticks of wood, so they run over their car with a tank and then laugh at them.
[01:09:21.227 --> 01:09:26.691]  We have Marine Corps chants now that have been in the news about have the children gather around, mow them little bastards down.
[01:09:26.711 --> 01:09:28.372]  I mean, what happened to us?
[01:09:28.452 --> 01:09:30.633]  I thought Saddam was bad because he tortured.
[01:09:31.454 --> 01:09:32.614]  But it's bad when he does it.
[01:09:32.634 --> 01:09:33.475]  It's good when we do it.
[01:09:34.375 --> 01:09:37.197]  Very, very painful to see this happening.
[01:09:37.237 --> 01:09:39.659]  And now new abuse photos of them beating people.
[01:09:40.099 --> 01:09:42.901]  Deaths are coming out and people smiling over dead bodies.
[01:09:44.382 --> 01:09:45.702]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:09:45.762 --> 01:09:46.223]  What happened?
[01:09:46.243 --> 01:09:48.164]  I remember talking to old World War II vets.
[01:09:49.079 --> 01:09:59.346]  When I'd be deer hunting around the campfire as a young man, and you couldn't get them to talk about World War II, and they were fighting a real enemy that was trying to kill them, not people they grabbed at a checkpoint.
[01:09:59.546 --> 01:10:02.228]  They killed a lot of people, and you couldn't get them to talk about it.
[01:10:02.689 --> 01:10:09.353]  Or if you did, they'd start getting teary-eyed, talking about having to kill a 14-year-old that was shooting at them.
[01:10:10.374 --> 01:10:17.059]  So what happened to us with this video game culture where we have this killer instinct that just...
[01:10:18.016 --> 01:10:21.720]  It's amazing, but more and more people in the military are going public.
[01:10:22.461 --> 01:10:26.305]  Last year and a half ago, four Delta Force members come back and kill their wives.
[01:10:26.345 --> 01:10:27.707]  I mean, what's going on?
[01:10:28.728 --> 01:10:37.458]  The Sacramento Bee had an article a few days ago, Atrocities in Iraq, I killed innocent people for our government, by Paul Rockwell, special of the Sacramento Bee.
[01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:53.760]  And this came out on the 16th, it's now the 21st, and we are joined by this former Staff Sergeant Jimmy Massey who has come out and told the world, quote, I killed innocent people for our government.
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:11:02.385]  We appreciate his incredible courage to break his conditioning and to come forward with this.
[01:11:02.885 --> 01:11:05.887]  And Sergeant Massey, it's an honor to have you on the broadcast.
[01:11:06.408 --> 01:11:06.708]  Thank you.
[01:11:08.087 --> 01:11:14.329]  Tell us a little bit about yourself and basically what you went over in the Sacramento Bee and some of the things that they didn't cover.
[01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:17.831]  Yeah, I'll give you a little bit of background and history about myself.
[01:11:18.811 --> 01:11:20.572]  I graduated from Pearland High School.
[01:11:22.913 --> 01:11:26.354]  From Pearland High School, I... Pearland, Texas, I'm sorry.
[01:11:27.054 --> 01:11:29.195]  From Pearland, Texas, I... And that's down in Houston.
[01:11:29.815 --> 01:11:31.376]  Yeah, on the outskirts near the coast.
[01:11:33.937 --> 01:11:35.097]  Near Friendswood and Gallup.
[01:11:35.598 --> 01:11:36.578]  Okay, please continue.
[01:11:37.569 --> 01:11:43.432]  I went to community college for a little while and decided to drop out of community college.
[01:11:44.493 --> 01:11:48.655]  I decided to join the Marine Corps.
[01:11:48.715 --> 01:11:52.917]  Money was tight growing up in a middle class neighborhood.
[01:11:52.937 --> 01:11:55.818]  I couldn't afford to continue on to go to college.
[01:11:56.359 --> 01:11:58.540]  I had a couple of buddies of mine that went into the service.
[01:12:00.301 --> 01:12:04.883]  I had always had the Marines on the back burner growing up as a
[01:12:05.675 --> 01:12:08.336]  As a kid, I always had a love for the military.
[01:12:08.676 --> 01:12:17.718]  At one time, I had requested to go to a military boys academy, but we couldn't afford it.
[01:12:18.438 --> 01:12:27.920]  So when the money ran out for college, I went ahead and decided to enlist and went to boot camp around 1992 time frame.
[01:12:30.321 --> 01:12:34.882]  I was originally signed with the infantry, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines out in 29 Palms, California.
[01:12:36.443 --> 01:12:57.452]  I finished up my tour there, re-enlisted, and went on to become an infantry instructor at the Marine Corps Boot Camp, Parris Island, South Carolina, where I taught the recruits basic infantry skills, how to survive in combat, rappelling, gas seamer, and the crucible as well.
[01:12:58.392 --> 01:13:03.174]  When I finished up with my tour as an instructor at Parris Island,
[01:13:03.792 --> 01:13:05.513]  A volunteer to go on recruiting duty.
[01:13:07.975 --> 01:13:12.079]  Growing up in Texas, I had the best of both worlds.
[01:13:13.279 --> 01:13:18.003]  During the summertime, I would go up and visit my relatives in western North Carolina.
[01:13:18.023 --> 01:13:21.066]  So I grew up in Texas and western North Carolina.
[01:13:22.347 --> 01:13:30.373]  So when I re-enlisted and volunteered to go on recruiting duty... Those are both very heavy marine recruiting zones.
[01:13:30.453 --> 01:13:31.594]  Isn't Texas the biggest?
[01:13:32.614 --> 01:13:36.735]  Yes, Texas is the number one recruiting state for the Marine Corps.
[01:13:36.915 --> 01:13:37.475]  That is correct.
[01:13:39.096 --> 01:13:47.939]  Okay, well let's accelerate through then your training, the mindset, and your statement here of killing innocent people for the government.
[01:13:49.139 --> 01:13:49.819]  Sure, sure.
[01:13:50.439 --> 01:14:01.383]  Basically, what had happened was we had received so much intelligence reports and these intelligence reports that we were receiving continuously through Iraq
[01:14:04.122 --> 01:14:11.806]  Basically painted a picture of an enemy that was everywhere, and the enemy was in civilian clothes.
[01:14:11.926 --> 01:14:17.809]  Well, I told you to fast forward, but let's go to the point where you rotate into Iraq, and then what happened there?
[01:14:18.829 --> 01:14:22.271]  Once we got into Iraq, basically we walked into the country.
[01:14:24.152 --> 01:14:26.653]  And what division, what group did you go in with?
[01:14:26.873 --> 01:14:29.355]  I was with the 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, Cat 1.
[01:14:30.422 --> 01:14:38.907]  And we were stationed out of 29 Palms, California, and I was part of RCT-7, which was an LSA-7 in Kuwait.
[01:14:40.668 --> 01:14:49.953]  We crossed the DMZ about March 22nd time frame, and rapidly moved up towards Baghdad.
[01:14:51.594 --> 01:14:58.378]  I was in cities like Al-Zubayr, Al-Numaniya, Salman Pak, Karbala.
[01:15:00.655 --> 01:15:06.078]  But to fast forward to, let's give you an example of the civilian casualties.
[01:15:06.898 --> 01:15:15.422]  These intelligence reports that we were given basically led us to believe that the enemy was everywhere, and we didn't know who the enemy was.
[01:15:16.463 --> 01:15:24.387]  Some of the examples of the intelligence reports were Iraqis using civilians, or Iraqi military using civilians as human shields.
[01:15:25.247 --> 01:15:29.049]  They were loading down ambulances, buses.
[01:15:29.588 --> 01:15:30.028]  I think so.
[01:15:48.393 --> 01:15:58.175]  Well, I mean, I remember watching the Marines going to Baghdad, live TV, and every truck with people just driving would be machine gun, dead bodies falling down, burning dead children all over the place.
[01:15:58.215 --> 01:16:00.716]  So basically they said, everybody's an enemy, attack, attack.
[01:16:01.036 --> 01:16:02.036]  That's pretty much it.
[01:16:02.056 --> 01:16:07.657]  And subsequently, we killed a lot of innocent civilians.
[01:16:08.117 --> 01:16:09.937]  Now, the numbers I've seen are from 15,000 to 50,000.
[01:16:10.718 --> 01:16:12.118]  No one really knows the true numbers.
[01:16:12.158 --> 01:16:12.838]  Where would you put it?
[01:16:14.339 --> 01:16:22.141]  I would say just with my scout snipers, machine guns, and missile men, just my platoon alone, 30-plus.
[01:16:24.402 --> 01:16:26.582]  I can't speak for... 30 people?
[01:16:26.602 --> 01:16:28.783]  30-plus civilians.
[01:16:29.623 --> 01:16:30.903]  Oh, not combatants.
[01:16:31.643 --> 01:16:32.403]  So how would this work?
[01:16:32.464 --> 01:16:36.004]  I mean, if a car is driving along, you just go ahead and open fire on it?
[01:16:36.084 --> 01:16:42.886]  Well, we would fire a warning shot, and prior to us leaving, we had actually made signs in Arabic that said stop, halt,
[01:16:45.043 --> 01:16:45.623]  Slow down.
[01:16:46.223 --> 01:16:47.584]  But they didn't work.
[01:16:48.644 --> 01:16:53.506]  And we would fire a warning shot at the vehicle's driver.
[01:16:54.046 --> 01:16:57.368]  However, if he didn't heed the warning shot, then we would light him up.
[01:16:57.788 --> 01:17:02.230]  Sometimes in the car, there would be women, children, old men.
[01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:07.272]  What was it like when you'd go into the car and there'd be splattered children everywhere?
[01:17:08.872 --> 01:17:09.632]  It was pretty horrible.
[01:17:10.133 --> 01:17:10.793]  As a matter of fact,
[01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:14.241]  Every night when I go to bed, I see it.
[01:17:16.062 --> 01:17:18.603]  You see those little children's guts all over the place?
[01:17:19.043 --> 01:17:19.423]  Yes, sir.
[01:17:19.783 --> 01:17:20.343]  Their brains?
[01:17:21.263 --> 01:17:23.024]  I want the neocons to listen to this, though.
[01:17:23.044 --> 01:17:26.625]  I want them to know, because they can sit there in their easy chair and say, kill them all.
[01:17:26.665 --> 01:17:32.847]  You know, when some thugs killed four contractors on radio, they said, kill everybody in Fallujah.
[01:17:33.488 --> 01:17:36.809]  So I guess if somebody commits a murder in Houston, we kill the whole city.
[01:17:37.229 --> 01:17:37.449]  Right.
[01:17:38.009 --> 01:17:40.270]  Well, you know, I mean, if you want to get into a little graphic,
[01:17:40.974 --> 01:17:53.564]  You know, a 50-cal round from an M2 Browning machine gun, when it hits a 14- or 15-year-old body, it basically separates their torso.
[01:17:54.605 --> 01:17:59.889]  And as you walk up on the scene, you see half of a torso.
[01:18:00.369 --> 01:18:04.052]  And then Marines running around and taking pictures of
[01:18:04.894 --> 01:18:18.459]  Well, I know that it was in the news that they'd see some women and just shoot them and say, well, you know, better dead than alive, and then there were reporters.
[01:18:18.639 --> 01:18:25.201]  Well, the actual statement that was given by one of my Marines was, better them than us.
[01:18:26.010 --> 01:18:30.955]  Well, they were at a hotel, some Marines, and there were Reuters reporters, and they just killed some children.
[01:18:31.015 --> 01:18:33.177]  And the reporter said, you just killed children.
[01:18:33.217 --> 01:18:34.678]  He said, good, I want to kill more.
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:38.162]  Yeah.
[01:18:38.842 --> 01:18:49.653]  Let me explain to you, with me being a recruiter, let me tell you the overall goal of what the Marine Corps, you know, what the Marine Corps' job is.
[01:18:50.699 --> 01:19:08.872]  You know, the official Marine Corps is going to tell you that they're there to give a young man intangibles, self-confidence, honor, courage, commitment, self-reliance, self-direction, all these intangibles that build this young man and, you know, makes him go out and be a productive member of society.
[01:19:09.373 --> 01:19:14.877]  However, what they don't explain is the reason that they were teaching these intangibles to these young men
[01:19:15.862 --> 01:19:20.643]  Is in order for them to meet the enemy on the battlefield and destroy him.
[01:19:21.223 --> 01:19:23.764]  That is a Marine's main purpose in life.
[01:19:24.424 --> 01:19:25.684]  That is what he is trained to do.
[01:19:27.105 --> 01:19:29.325]  To eat his own guts and ask for more.
[01:19:29.725 --> 01:19:30.105]  Yes, sir.
[01:19:30.886 --> 01:19:31.826]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:19:31.846 --> 01:19:37.407]  I want to talk about these chants that have been in the news of having school children gather around, mow them bastards down.
[01:19:37.427 --> 01:19:38.567]  Did you guys have those chants?
[01:19:39.428 --> 01:19:39.988]  Sure, sure.
[01:19:40.028 --> 01:19:44.669]  That's something that while we're singing cadence, while we're running...
[01:19:46.189 --> 01:19:47.674]  But I talked to family who were Marines.
[01:19:47.694 --> 01:19:50.544]  They said 20 years ago they didn't sing songs about killing children.
[01:19:50.765 --> 01:19:51.467]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:19:51.487 --> 01:19:52.069]  We'll come right back.
[01:19:55.171 --> 01:19:59.672]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:20:00.032 --> 01:20:04.113]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:20:04.413 --> 01:20:04.973]  We listened.
[01:20:05.273 --> 01:20:10.234]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:20:10.534 --> 01:20:11.014]  We listened.
[01:20:11.394 --> 01:20:14.435]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:20:14.855 --> 01:20:15.395]  We listened.
[01:20:15.855 --> 01:20:19.616]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:20:19.616 --> 01:20:20.477]  We're good to go.
[01:20:44.827 --> 01:20:45.368]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[01:20:45.388 --> 01:20:46.429]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:20:55.982 --> 01:21:01.467]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:21:01.887 --> 01:21:06.110]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:21:06.351 --> 01:21:13.396]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:21:13.777 --> 01:21:19.882]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:21:20.022 --> 01:21:21.223]  There are no side effects.
[01:21:21.383 --> 01:21:21.883]  We're good to go.
[01:21:38.354 --> 01:21:44.996]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.

[01:21:54.899 --> 01:21:56.659]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[01:21:57.159 --> 01:22:00.600]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:01.761]  Let's update.
[01:22:02.281 --> 01:22:05.722]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[01:22:07.642 --> 01:22:10.103]  The NASDAQ in that same time frame is flat.
[01:22:10.783 --> 01:22:11.724]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[01:22:11.764 --> 01:22:14.084]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[01:22:14.605 --> 01:22:15.505]  Today, the U.S.
[01:22:15.525 --> 01:22:17.746]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[01:22:18.166 --> 01:22:19.687]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[01:22:20.267 --> 01:22:22.248]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283.
[01:22:23.608 --> 01:22:28.470]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[01:22:29.450 --> 01:22:30.211]  Gold is moving.
[01:22:30.471 --> 01:22:31.611]  Equities are treading water.
[01:22:32.011 --> 01:22:34.692]  There's a little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[01:22:35.212 --> 01:22:36.553]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[01:22:37.011 --> 01:22:38.733]  Physical possession, private gold.
[01:22:39.153 --> 01:22:41.116]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[01:22:41.516 --> 01:22:45.381]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[01:22:45.821 --> 01:22:47.943]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.
[01:22:48.344 --> 01:22:48.644]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.228 --> 01:23:01.654]  Folks, the future of gardening is upon us, and whether you grow for fun, food, or profit, you'll discover great new ways to reap more rewards from everything you grow at futuregarden.com.
[01:23:01.934 --> 01:23:03.055]  Want to jumpstart on spring?
[01:23:03.295 --> 01:23:09.939]  Bring the power of the summer sun indoors and get your favorite seedlings off to a healthy start with a high-intensity grow light from futuregarden.com.
[01:23:10.079 --> 01:23:16.704]  When the outdoor season winds down, put your high-intensity grow light back to work to serve up fresh-grown produce for prize-winning orchids in the dead of winter.
[01:23:16.924 --> 01:23:17.945]  Short on time or space?
[01:23:18.185 --> 01:23:22.027]  Now you can grow twice as much in half the space without mess or back-breaking work.
[01:23:22.207 --> 01:23:23.128]  Think smart gardening.
[01:23:23.348 --> 01:23:23.568]  That's 888-338-3305.
[01:23:23.628 --> 01:23:25.309]  Phone lines open Monday through Friday only.
[01:23:54.785 --> 01:23:57.489]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:23:57.509 --> 01:24:01.453]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:13.148]  Alright, we're talking to former Staff Sergeant Jimmy Massey, who has come out and told the world, quote, I killed innocent people for our government.
[01:24:15.339 --> 01:24:27.323]  Now, sir, before we get more into this and the brainwashing, because during the break I talked to you about this, how things have shifted from kill a commie for mommy to kill school children, death, death, death.
[01:24:27.924 --> 01:24:30.304]  I mean, a cold brainwashing, and you said you agreed with that.
[01:24:30.845 --> 01:24:32.545]  Why have you decided to come forward?
[01:24:32.625 --> 01:24:34.646]  What was the tipping point?
[01:24:34.686 --> 01:24:36.687]  Was it just maturity that you've gotten older?
[01:24:37.587 --> 01:24:41.088]  Yeah, it was just maturity, and, you know, and I...
[01:24:44.429 --> 01:24:45.730]  But I'll be honest with you.
[01:24:46.971 --> 01:24:53.895]  When I was on recruiting duty the last year that I was on there, I was really having a hard time then.
[01:24:54.456 --> 01:25:03.782]  Just because I felt that what I was being asked to do was not a lie, but not all the truth.
[01:25:04.903 --> 01:25:08.425]  And I was just having second thoughts about that.
[01:25:09.186 --> 01:25:13.489]  But I felt recruiting duty was something that was just a part of...
[01:25:14.540 --> 01:25:16.340]  You know, part of my career as a Marine.
[01:25:17.081 --> 01:25:33.504]  But when I got to Iraq, it was shortly after recruiting duty, there was an incident where we had just killed a bunch of civilians, and one of the survivors had looked up at me and said, you know, why did you kill my brother?
[01:25:34.204 --> 01:25:35.384]  We didn't do anything to you.
[01:25:36.305 --> 01:25:38.985]  And that was it.
[01:25:39.565 --> 01:25:41.866]  You know, after he said that to me, I just...
[01:25:43.556 --> 01:25:46.177]  I made a conscious decision there.
[01:25:46.797 --> 01:25:54.619]  And the reason that I've been doing this is just to repair my soul.
[01:25:55.559 --> 01:26:04.161]  And that's why I've been speaking out against... Well, something's wrong when four Delta Force operators come home in the same unit and slaughter their wives.
[01:26:05.061 --> 01:26:05.981]  Oh, I definitely agree.
[01:26:06.262 --> 01:26:07.262]  I mean, something's wrong.
[01:26:07.302 --> 01:26:11.783]  I mean, I know old soldiers are all dead now who were just...
[01:26:12.958 --> 01:26:25.385]  You know, silver stars and Congressional Medal of Honor, and people I know personally, and they wouldn't talk about it, and they were fighting real enemies, and if you got them to start talking, they'd get a tear in their eye.
[01:26:26.056 --> 01:26:28.857]  I mean, and especially if they accidentally killed children.
[01:26:29.097 --> 01:26:32.518]  But now, I mean, a lot of these people, I hear them calling the shows, bragging about it.
[01:26:32.578 --> 01:26:43.862]  I mean, what type of psychopath, I mean, what's the training that, and you said that, yes, you know these cadences, have the little children gather around, toss the candy on the ground, muddle little bastards down.
[01:26:43.902 --> 01:26:46.643]  I mean, who comes up with this stuff?
[01:26:48.104 --> 01:26:53.526]  Well, it's the individual leaders within, you know, the units.
[01:26:54.193 --> 01:27:04.976]  And the section leaders that are in charge of the Marine or Airmen or... I can't really speak for the other branches of the service, so I'll just refer to the Marine Corps.
[01:27:05.456 --> 01:27:22.581]  But it's up to the individual unit leaders that... Were other members of your unit, your group that you were with, and the folks under you, I mean, when people were looking up holding their dead babies in their hands with their entrails spilling out all over and really looking at the reality of this, I mean, did others have a problem with this?
[01:27:24.808 --> 01:27:26.909]  Well, it's kind of like a code of honor.
[01:27:28.230 --> 01:27:30.151]  What happens overseas stays overseas.
[01:27:32.013 --> 01:27:45.543]  However, I couldn't go on living my life like that and living under that code.
[01:27:46.463 --> 01:27:50.246]  But when the gentleman looked up at me and said, why did you kill my brother?
[01:27:51.928 --> 01:27:52.308]  That was it.
[01:27:55.618 --> 01:28:01.880]  I want people to get the image in their mind, because we've got such a soft general public that's never really experienced anything, any real hardships.
[01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:08.663]  I don't understand, but what was it like when women were wailing and gnashing their teeth and howling with their dead babies?
[01:28:08.703 --> 01:28:13.225]  I mean, we've got the images of toddlers splattered all over the place, bodies burned out of the ground.
[01:28:13.265 --> 01:28:14.685]  I mean, what was that like?
[01:28:15.926 --> 01:28:18.927]  Well, I can tell you for me, it was horrible.
[01:28:19.407 --> 01:28:20.907]  I actually had a...
[01:28:23.436 --> 01:28:30.720]  The child died in my arms while my corpsman was trying to resuscitate the child.
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:42.706]  The reason that the child expired was because he was in and around an area that was getting bombed by our aircraft.
[01:28:42.746 --> 01:28:49.650]  Having the father sit there and explain how his family was doing nothing
[01:28:50.602 --> 01:28:53.424]  And all of a sudden, you know, a bomb just explodes next to him.
[01:28:54.705 --> 01:28:58.488]  And he's looking at me saying, you know, I never worked for Saddam.
[01:28:59.188 --> 01:29:01.249]  You know, I had no affiliation with Saddam.
[01:29:01.289 --> 01:29:08.034]  Well, on top of this, you know, people shoot some guns in the air at a wedding and they kill 40 of them and the government's basically laughing about this now.
[01:29:09.175 --> 01:29:10.336]  Oh, yeah.
[01:29:11.416 --> 01:29:12.517]  I didn't really get the gist.
[01:29:13.678 --> 01:29:16.480]  I was kind of torn until I got back stateside.
[01:29:17.395 --> 01:29:20.678]  Because while we were over there, we never got any type of information.
[01:29:20.738 --> 01:29:26.262]  All we were given was just official intelligence reports.
[01:29:26.622 --> 01:29:28.844]  So we gathered our information off of that.
[01:29:31.326 --> 01:29:37.791]  So it wasn't until I came back stateside and I watched the show that CNN... Stay there, sir.
[01:29:37.971 --> 01:29:38.712]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:38.732 --> 01:29:40.153]  Appreciate you joining us.
[01:29:40.473 --> 01:29:41.214]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:29:44.241 --> 01:29:45.241]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.622 --> 01:29:47.262]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:48.143 --> 01:29:50.944]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:54.626 --> 01:29:55.626]  It's finally here.
[01:29:55.746 --> 01:29:56.726]  Spring has arrived.
[01:29:56.926 --> 01:29:59.888]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:30:00.108 --> 01:30:03.549]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:30:03.569 --> 01:30:11.893]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the ARC Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[01:30:12.193 --> 01:30:15.914]  With Ark's Heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.

[01:31:53.732 --> 01:31:56.573]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[01:31:56.693 --> 01:31:57.514]  Michael Trudeau here.
[01:31:57.654 --> 01:32:00.955]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[01:32:01.135 --> 01:32:06.818]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[01:32:06.938 --> 01:32:09.960]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:14.483]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[01:32:14.683 --> 01:32:16.584]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[01:32:16.704 --> 01:32:23.768]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again, with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[01:32:23.968 --> 01:32:26.430]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[01:32:26.730 --> 01:32:31.054]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice, only this time it changed my life.
[01:32:31.334 --> 01:32:33.096]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement.
[01:32:33.176 --> 01:32:35.298]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[01:32:35.478 --> 01:32:37.920]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:40.683]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[01:32:40.863 --> 01:32:41.383]  Side effects?
[01:32:41.624 --> 01:32:43.846]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[01:32:43.986 --> 01:32:45.487]  Call Kliscott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[01:32:45.507 --> 01:32:45.707]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[01:32:45.807 --> 01:32:47.129]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[01:32:47.149 --> 01:32:47.769]  It worked for me.
[01:32:59.096 --> 01:33:00.997]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:01.477 --> 01:33:04.277]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:08.578 --> 01:33:14.540]  If America was invaded, I would be the first volunteer tomorrow.
[01:33:16.100 --> 01:33:26.663]  But when I read the corporate documents by PNAC, the president, the vice president, before they were even elected, saying Shaddam isn't a threat, he's a pretext to get the oil, to use Iraq as a military base...
[01:33:27.529 --> 01:33:47.424]  When I read them saying we need terror attacks to get the people behind this, when I then see posse commentatus being erased, urban warfare training all over the place, my cousin now based here in Austin has been with Special Forces for 18 years, merging the military and the police covertly out at Bergstrom Airport.
[01:33:48.385 --> 01:33:51.948]  When I hear we've got to give up our liberties now, that's killing America.
[01:33:53.565 --> 01:33:55.946]  And then to watch it live on Fox.
[01:33:55.966 --> 01:33:56.886]  They didn't even hide this.
[01:33:57.007 --> 01:33:58.347]  The tanks going in.
[01:33:58.667 --> 01:34:00.088]  The Marines of the Army going in.
[01:34:00.408 --> 01:34:03.489]  And buses and cars and taxis and just shooting vehicles.
[01:34:03.589 --> 01:34:05.070]  Bodies falling out.
[01:34:05.210 --> 01:34:06.870]  Every vehicle on the road.
[01:34:07.611 --> 01:34:09.111]  High noon, driving down the street.
[01:34:09.191 --> 01:34:09.992]  Kill everybody.
[01:34:10.052 --> 01:34:11.552]  Kill, kill, kill, kill.
[01:34:11.953 --> 01:34:13.273]  People say, well, we're in a war.
[01:34:13.773 --> 01:34:15.514]  Folks, that's what the Nazis would do.
[01:34:15.734 --> 01:34:17.835]  They would go into a place and kill everybody.
[01:34:18.701 --> 01:34:20.242]  Okay, that's what the Russians would do.
[01:34:20.682 --> 01:34:22.043]  That's what the Vietnamese would do.
[01:34:22.223 --> 01:34:24.365]  Americans don't act like that.
[01:34:24.785 --> 01:34:27.907]  Americans don't have cadences about killing children.
[01:34:28.908 --> 01:34:29.928]  Okay, do you understand?
[01:34:29.948 --> 01:34:43.497]  And these people that don't have a conscience, who don't have the moral courage, and it takes incredible moral courage to admit something was wrong, people that don't have the moral courage of Staff Sergeant Jimmy Massey,
[01:34:44.224 --> 01:34:47.385]  They're going to come back and be cops on your streets, people.
[01:34:47.945 --> 01:34:52.486]  And you better be concerned about this and the torture that's going on over there that's going on in our prisons.
[01:34:53.547 --> 01:34:55.527]  And so that's why this is such a great concern.
[01:34:55.547 --> 01:34:57.908]  Now, I know that we've had callers holding to the start of the show.
[01:34:58.528 --> 01:34:59.968]  I never gave the phone number out today.
[01:35:00.548 --> 01:35:01.329]  Usually I take calls.
[01:35:01.349 --> 01:35:04.870]  We've had a lot of guests on today, and everybody's been holding forever, and we'll get to you.
[01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:07.270]  But I hope it's for our guest.
[01:35:08.210 --> 01:35:09.311]  So that's coming up.
[01:35:12.526 --> 01:35:24.931]  Sergeant Massey, going back to just the video I saw of trucks and cars, and this was live on television being machine-gunned, and some of them tapes.
[01:35:24.991 --> 01:35:25.831]  They were proud of it.
[01:35:27.792 --> 01:35:29.132]  You said you were in some other cities.
[01:35:29.172 --> 01:35:35.295]  Did you go into Baghdad, or did you go into town in the first part of the invasion?
[01:35:35.655 --> 01:35:41.097]  Are you aware of the video we've all seen here of just shooting everything that moves?
[01:35:43.208 --> 01:35:45.669]  Yes, and that's what it was like.
[01:35:46.610 --> 01:35:47.310]  That's exactly.
[01:35:48.291 --> 01:35:58.897]  You know, when you saw the Israeli attack, what was that, two days ago, with a bomb, you know, landing in the middle, that was what it was like.
[01:36:00.738 --> 01:36:03.379]  So you got a busy market, and just here comes a bomb.
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:04.140]  There you go.
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:05.581]  Now, look.
[01:36:07.433 --> 01:36:10.955]  The British haven't had as many problems because they're old empire hands.
[01:36:11.015 --> 01:36:12.976]  They know to be nice to people and things go better.
[01:36:13.296 --> 01:36:16.697]  A lot of Iraqis, at least when you were there, were happy when we first got there.
[01:36:16.997 --> 01:36:19.378]  Then it all shifted because, hey, you killed my brother.
[01:36:19.398 --> 01:36:21.900]  There you go.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:22.900]  But not my words.
[01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:25.381]  If that's accurate, give it to us in your words.
[01:36:28.242 --> 01:36:29.163]  No, you're exactly right.
[01:36:29.423 --> 01:36:36.106]  I feel the Iraqis are just retaliating against the brutality.
[01:36:37.082 --> 01:36:38.042]  Yeah, I think that's a great question.
[01:37:01.408 --> 01:37:03.850]  ...lit up a demonstration that was going on.
[01:37:04.230 --> 01:37:06.472]  This was on the outskirts of Baghdad.
[01:37:06.552 --> 01:37:08.654]  Now, by lit up, you mean machine gun fire?
[01:37:08.834 --> 01:37:09.154]  Correct.
[01:37:09.174 --> 01:37:11.176]  50 cals and M16.
[01:37:12.337 --> 01:37:20.503]  And, okay, now there's been a hundred of these reports out where you've got peaceful people, and then suddenly the troops open fire.
[01:37:20.663 --> 01:37:22.344]  How is that happening?
[01:37:23.545 --> 01:37:29.310]  Well, what topped it off with us is we heard a straight gunfire that came in that direction.
[01:37:31.517 --> 01:37:37.103]  When the stray gunfire went off, the Marines were nervous and they opened up.
[01:37:37.784 --> 01:37:39.626]  They didn't know which direction that was coming from.
[01:37:40.066 --> 01:37:47.614]  However, it is very important for you to understand the psychological impact that these intelligence reports have
[01:37:49.850 --> 01:37:54.151]  Well, let me stop you about these intelligence reports, because it goes the same way with cops.
[01:37:54.571 --> 01:38:05.254]  I've been out at a land rights demonstration with conservatives, libertarians, and we're all standing there in our three-piece suits, and we'll hear the police radios.
[01:38:05.294 --> 01:38:05.955]  They're militia.
[01:38:06.315 --> 01:38:07.215]  They may be terrorists.
[01:38:07.315 --> 01:38:08.335]  They're Republic of Texas.
[01:38:09.196 --> 01:38:14.817]  I mean, I see police being manipulated by the same type of departmental propaganda.
[01:38:15.017 --> 01:38:15.738]  Is that where you're going?
[01:38:16.218 --> 01:38:16.618]  Exactly.
[01:38:17.643 --> 01:38:18.763]  And that's what it is.
[01:38:18.863 --> 01:38:20.084]  It's just propaganda.
[01:38:20.464 --> 01:38:22.484]  Propaganda that's fueling a fire.
[01:38:22.864 --> 01:38:25.525]  Hell, they're even saying it on the TV.
[01:38:25.625 --> 01:38:28.685]  They were talking about it this morning on CNN.
[01:38:29.045 --> 01:38:36.527]  They were actually giving civilians the knowledge on what they need to know to suspect a terrorist.
[01:38:36.607 --> 01:38:39.967]  They were saying if you smell chemicals on the person, that could be a terrorist.
[01:38:40.628 --> 01:38:42.548]  And then they went as far as to even say that
[01:38:43.231 --> 01:38:46.833]  A person, a female that is pregnant might not be pregnant.
[01:38:46.913 --> 01:38:49.575]  She could be hiding anthrax.
[01:38:50.055 --> 01:38:58.801]  Two years ago, I saw a FEMA report in the Associated Press in New Jersey, and they had all the town people there, and they said, pregnant women, don't trust them, priest.
[01:38:59.261 --> 01:39:01.763]  People that, you know, everybody's guilty.
[01:39:01.803 --> 01:39:02.984]  This is East Germany.
[01:39:03.224 --> 01:39:07.387]  Terrorists are hiding under every, I mean, just watch everyone.
[01:39:07.427 --> 01:39:08.107]  This is sick.
[01:39:08.707 --> 01:39:08.968]  Right.
[01:39:09.128 --> 01:39:10.288]  It's no longer the communists.
[01:39:10.328 --> 01:39:11.069]  Now it's the terrorists.
[01:39:11.727 --> 01:39:13.008]  McCarthyism is alive.
[01:39:13.148 --> 01:39:14.909]  It's just extended into terrorism.
[01:39:16.931 --> 01:39:23.936]  Well, to use that term, they actually burned McCarthy when he found out the truth, that it wasn't the big banks behind the communists, but our own government.
[01:39:23.976 --> 01:39:33.022]  But you're right to say that, you know, to use that term and the common meaning, I mean, now they can't fire any terrorists, so they're using the Patriot Act just for average crimes.
[01:39:33.503 --> 01:39:33.843]  Correct.
[01:39:35.044 --> 01:39:40.608]  And I'll tell you right now, we violated the Geneva Convention.
[01:39:41.647 --> 01:39:56.797]  However the President or Congress, however they want to manipulate the words of what the Geneva Convention says, I know that I was taught from day one that I went into the United States Marine Corps, you do not shoot civilians.
[01:39:57.878 --> 01:39:58.698]  And that's what we did.
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:06.783]  Have you been having the nightmares since you started talking, or are you still having the images of the dead children?
[01:40:07.724 --> 01:40:07.784]  Uh...
[01:40:11.354 --> 01:40:14.316]  I've had them for a little over a year now, continuously.
[01:40:14.816 --> 01:40:17.018]  Some nights, you know, I may have a good week.
[01:40:17.058 --> 01:40:19.699]  I may go one to two nights where I won't dream.
[01:40:21.901 --> 01:40:23.582]  Or you won't, I'm sorry, your phone cut out.
[01:40:23.862 --> 01:40:32.107]  Yeah, I may go one to two nights where I won't dream about it, but then I'll go sometimes two or four nights where I will dream about it.
[01:40:32.767 --> 01:40:34.088]  Do you wake up in a cold sweat?
[01:40:34.468 --> 01:40:38.050]  Yes, and very easily startled.
[01:40:40.829 --> 01:40:43.250]  My fiancée, she knows not to touch me.
[01:40:44.251 --> 01:40:52.255]  Or if she's coming into the room and I'm there by myself, she says that she's coming into the room so that I don't get startled.
[01:40:54.936 --> 01:40:56.217]  That happens to a lot of people.
[01:40:57.972 --> 01:40:59.433]  Well, I mean, think about that.
[01:40:59.473 --> 01:41:01.575]  Now they're going to come back and be cops.
[01:41:19.862 --> 01:41:32.528]  And we've seen the reports of people that got back a year ago from Afghanistan, two years ago, they're on duty and they put three rounds in an old lady's chest as she sits at the wheel of her car because they saw the glint of metal on her purse.
[01:41:34.349 --> 01:41:34.569]  Right.
[01:41:35.069 --> 01:41:48.456]  And, I mean, that's pretty much the number one occupation for, you know, Marine infantry, the Rangers, or, you know, that's pretty much after you retire out of the military, you go to work for a civilian police force and...
[01:41:49.215 --> 01:41:53.076]  Do your 20 years, and that way you've got your state pension and you've got your government check.
[01:41:54.297 --> 01:41:57.478]  But you're just switching from one government organization to the other.
[01:41:58.418 --> 01:42:04.921]  I saw a statistic that 80% of the new recruits in the last five years have been out of the military.
[01:42:05.121 --> 01:42:06.901]  That's correct, yeah.
[01:42:06.921 --> 01:42:14.804]  Matter of fact, when I got back to my hometown here in North Carolina, the sheriff contacted me and offered me a job.
[01:42:16.204 --> 01:42:17.185]  I told him no.
[01:42:20.131 --> 01:42:22.213]  Well, at least until you work through all this.
[01:42:22.633 --> 01:42:23.614]  Right.
[01:42:23.854 --> 01:42:27.718]  But a lot of people, though, I mean, well, you were there.
[01:42:29.799 --> 01:42:30.840]  You know what, Stephanie?
[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:33.162]  Do you have that PBS clip we aired a month ago?
[01:42:33.583 --> 01:42:36.505]  Try to find that where they're running over the car for stealing the firewood.
[01:42:38.487 --> 01:42:38.867]  Have you?
[01:42:38.887 --> 01:42:40.509]  Well, you were there.
[01:42:41.590 --> 01:42:44.132]  Some people stole three sticks of firewood, they thought.
[01:42:44.759 --> 01:42:54.369]  And so they laugh at them, they machine gun the car, or shoot it up actually with small arms with handguns, and then they run over it with a tank and then laugh at them.
[01:42:54.910 --> 01:42:55.510]  Did you see that?
[01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:57.572]  No, sir, I never saw that one.
[01:42:58.994 --> 01:43:00.756]  Did you ever see a behavior?
[01:43:01.336 --> 01:43:02.918]  It wouldn't surprise me if that did happen.
[01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:06.021]  Stephanie, do you have the clip?
[01:43:08.267 --> 01:43:13.410]  I'm going to put you on hold, Sergeant, and we're going to play this, and I want to get your response to this.
[01:43:13.470 --> 01:43:15.531]  Now, I want you to hear the laughing.
[01:43:15.571 --> 01:43:16.412]  This is very funny.
[01:43:16.512 --> 01:43:21.094]  Now, even if they were going to do this, there might be some excuse, but the laughing part.
[01:43:21.835 --> 01:43:23.155]  Let's go ahead and play that.
[01:43:24.196 --> 01:43:26.557]  There was still some looting going on when we arrived.
[01:43:30.119 --> 01:43:33.641]  And when we came across soldiers, they didn't seem sure of their role.
[01:43:35.382 --> 01:43:36.663]  That child don't need to be here.
[01:43:39.433 --> 01:43:45.819]  We filmed these GIs after they caught a group of Iraqis stealing wood.
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:52.485]  We try to stop them from looting, they don't understand, so we take their car and we'll crush them.
[01:43:52.505 --> 01:43:54.027]  United States Army tankers, who are they?
[01:44:30.366 --> 01:44:34.669]  That's what you get when you lose.
[01:44:36.030 --> 01:44:39.732]  Later, the car's owner told us, I'm a taxi driver.
[01:44:40.493 --> 01:44:41.974]  The car was my livelihood.
[01:44:44.116 --> 01:44:45.577]  Sergeant, any comments to that?
[01:44:48.038 --> 01:44:48.979]  Man, I'll tell you what.
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:55.624]  I actually laid down on my couch here while I was listening to that.
[01:44:55.684 --> 01:44:57.185]  I was having flashbacks.
[01:44:59.488 --> 01:45:00.689]  That's a typical day, partner.
[01:45:03.671 --> 01:45:05.432]  A typical day.
[01:45:06.093 --> 01:45:07.394]  The funny thing is, the British...
[01:45:08.129 --> 01:45:10.070]  Don't want their people getting killed, so they're not doing any of this.
[01:45:10.091 --> 01:45:13.173]  They're not having 100 the problems, according to the reports.
[01:45:13.813 --> 01:45:21.939]  But our government's doing this, and I guarantee you when the UN comes in, they're going to stop this, and then they're going to be the good cop, and we're going to be the bad cop.
[01:45:21.959 --> 01:45:23.120]  This was all staged.
[01:45:23.540 --> 01:45:25.282]  I said this before the war even began.
[01:45:25.802 --> 01:45:34.989]  Israel is advising us how to bulldoze their date palms if somebody steals something or doesn't show respect, and this is meant to cause resistance.
[01:45:35.049 --> 01:45:36.450]  I think it's meant to widen all of this.
[01:45:36.890 --> 01:45:39.571]  And it's a sick joke on the Iraqi people and our own troops.
[01:45:41.973 --> 01:45:43.473]  I think you hit the nail right on the head.
[01:45:43.794 --> 01:45:44.494]  I totally agree.
[01:45:45.635 --> 01:45:48.116]  I believe this thing was pre-staged from the get-go.
[01:45:49.236 --> 01:45:51.177]  And I'll give you a little bit of evidence.
[01:45:52.038 --> 01:46:03.844]  1st Battalion, 7th Marines, eight months prior to leaving to go to Kuwait, was secretly training up in San Francisco, north of San Francisco.
[01:46:04.577 --> 01:46:07.078]  Learning how to shut down the Ramallah oil fields.
[01:46:08.939 --> 01:46:15.723]  I was part of RCT-7, and our primary mission at the beginning of the war was to shut down the Ramallah oil fields.
[01:46:16.283 --> 01:46:24.187]  However, why wouldn't Marines be learning how to shut down oil fields if we weren't scheduled to invade or attack?
[01:46:24.647 --> 01:46:28.509]  I'll tell you what the official word that was given to us, because I asked the same question.
[01:46:29.252 --> 01:46:37.598]  They said, well, it's in case of future terrorist attacks in America where the Marines have to be used kind of like an environmental protection.
[01:46:38.879 --> 01:46:40.880]  Now, let me shift here for a minute.
[01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:41.241]  Sure.
[01:46:41.801 --> 01:46:47.085]  I've got an Associated Press here where it says the biggest group of recruits now is illegal aliens, and they make legal.
[01:46:49.426 --> 01:46:54.390]  I have been to the urban warfare training drills where the Marines openly admit that it's for domestic insurgents.
[01:46:55.037 --> 01:46:57.439]  We know about the different surveys the Marines have been given.
[01:46:57.739 --> 01:47:02.183]  They're saying General Eberhardt, the head of NORTHCOM, said that we're going to have troops on the streets in America.
[01:47:02.684 --> 01:47:10.750]  The outgoing head of CENTCOM, Franks, December's cigar aficionado, said that after the next attack we set aside the Constitution for a military government.
[01:47:12.552 --> 01:47:17.756]  A lot of this is joint training for here domestically, and I just want to get your response to that.
[01:47:20.529 --> 01:47:23.970]  So you're saying a possible violation of the Posse Comitatus Act?
[01:47:24.130 --> 01:47:29.793]  Well, yeah, we've had senators call for getting rid of it, but since in 96 I've had JAG officers on it, but it's basically already gone.
[01:47:29.813 --> 01:47:33.594]  I mean, I've interviewed Marines who had... Well, let me tell you part of the oath.
[01:47:34.394 --> 01:47:43.438]  You know, it's to protect our country against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:47:45.879 --> 01:47:46.939]  Did I just answer your question?
[01:47:47.429 --> 01:47:56.821]  Well, they're able to use the Marines domestically because they're not under Posse Comitatus, but... Well, no, the Marines are under the Posse Comitatus.
[01:47:57.001 --> 01:47:57.602]  As a matter of fact...
[01:47:58.228 --> 01:48:04.114]  We had to train extensively in that because we... Well, they may tell you that, but we've had the JAG officers on who say that isn't so.
[01:48:04.334 --> 01:48:04.714]  Really?
[01:48:04.914 --> 01:48:05.195]  Okay.
[01:48:05.335 --> 01:48:06.796]  Maybe they're trying to claim that now.
[01:48:07.377 --> 01:48:07.597]  Right.
[01:48:07.917 --> 01:48:08.958]  Well, here's an example.
[01:48:09.018 --> 01:48:23.372]  My cousin is out there merging the APD, the National Guard and the regular Army, at Berkstrom, which is now a private airport, international airport, and they're engaged in surveillance of Austin, and it has nothing to do, he even admits, with terrorism.
[01:48:23.852 --> 01:48:27.015]  Yeah, that's under what's called the Joint Task Force.
[01:48:27.135 --> 01:48:28.036]  Six.
[01:48:28.676 --> 01:48:28.876]  Right.
[01:48:28.936 --> 01:48:34.721]  I was involved with that actually during three missions in my career in the Marine Corps.
[01:48:34.741 --> 01:48:39.124]  Two were in Southern California and one was in New Mexico.
[01:48:39.865 --> 01:48:41.106]  And that is true.
[01:48:41.386 --> 01:48:42.107]  The U.S.
[01:48:42.127 --> 01:48:45.509]  Government is being used, or the U.S.
[01:48:45.549 --> 01:48:50.153]  Marine Corps, they're being used as surveillance.
[01:48:53.452 --> 01:48:55.433]  And then we had the Wall Street Journal two months ago.
[01:48:55.513 --> 01:49:03.821]  They had a peace group at the UT, and they had secret military officers in plain clothes harassing them, trying to shut down meetings.
[01:49:03.841 --> 01:49:15.411]  Let me tell you, in America, we're not supposed to have commissars, political officers from the military, running around at the University of Texas.
[01:49:15.591 --> 01:49:17.132]  That was Army intelligence, by the way.
[01:49:17.433 --> 01:49:17.593]  Yeah.
[01:49:19.198 --> 01:49:32.929]  No, and over the course of my 12 years in the Marine Corps, I continuously saw it growing bigger and bigger because they're sub-branching off into these special anti-terrorist units.
[01:49:34.610 --> 01:49:38.553]  So it's happening very rapidly.
[01:49:39.494 --> 01:49:44.097]  And you saw CNN saying, don't trust the pregnant women, watch everyone, report them?
[01:49:44.358 --> 01:49:44.898]  That is correct.
[01:49:44.918 --> 01:49:47.420]  That was on CNN this morning.
[01:49:48.436 --> 01:49:50.036]  That's not America, is it, Sergeant?
[01:49:50.676 --> 01:49:51.177]  No, sir.
[01:49:51.197 --> 01:49:53.697]  That's not the America that I grew up to.
[01:49:56.498 --> 01:50:03.339]  Well, you know, Hitler blew up his own government building to seize control and to set up fatherland security.
[01:50:05.340 --> 01:50:13.521]  You know, like I said, I started drawing my conclusion after I came back from Iraq because it disturbed me so much.
[01:50:13.541 --> 01:50:15.922]  And I basically told the Marine Corps, hey,
[01:50:17.581 --> 01:50:18.642]  I don't want your money anymore.
[01:50:18.702 --> 01:50:19.722]  I don't want your benefits.
[01:50:20.763 --> 01:50:25.785]  I had to hire a lawyer because they were trying to say that I was a conscientious observer.
[01:50:27.106 --> 01:50:33.149]  It got really nasty, but they discharged me honorably with disability and severance pay.
[01:50:33.189 --> 01:50:39.172]  They diagnosed me with post-traumatic stress disorder and major depression, but they didn't want to let me go.
[01:50:39.212 --> 01:50:41.973]  I tell you what, every day I fear for my life.
[01:50:43.494 --> 01:50:44.414]  Stay there, my friend.
[01:50:44.434 --> 01:50:45.755]  We'll come by and take a few calls.
[01:50:47.330 --> 01:50:47.850]  Who wouldn't?
[01:50:47.890 --> 01:50:52.232]  If you have a conscience, of course you'd be upset after having children die in your arms.

[01:51:57.727 --> 01:52:02.210]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:52:02.310 --> 01:52:03.111]  There is a change.
[01:52:04.701 --> 01:52:06.702]  This disaster is a new world order.
[01:52:06.782 --> 01:52:09.584]  A new world order can emerge.
[01:52:09.844 --> 01:52:14.067]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:52:14.127 --> 01:52:21.072]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:52:21.192 --> 01:52:23.193]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:52:23.433 --> 01:52:33.995]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:52:34.195 --> 01:52:39.536]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:54:00.957 --> 01:54:03.259]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:54:11.912 --> 01:54:16.775]  Alright, I want to try to keep our guests five minutes into the next hour if we can, then we'll get our next guest on.
[01:54:16.795 --> 01:54:27.301]  Talking about the strange life, the quiet American, Nick Berg, with the intelligence background, obviously, and the bizarreness going on there.
[01:54:27.321 --> 01:54:32.064]  But, boy, this has just been an incredible interview.
[01:54:34.306 --> 01:54:39.249]  What scares me is that some people who don't have a conscience are immune to having children die on their arms.
[01:54:39.269 --> 01:54:41.350]  They're going to come back here and run our lives.
[01:54:42.515 --> 01:54:58.124]  This is all part of the process the New World Order is using, and it's going to be good people like Sergeant Massey, who I guess will be here on the front line speaking out against it, and who knows, maybe having to fight against it as things get darker here inside this system.
[01:54:59.024 --> 01:55:04.307]  But before we go to some calls, is there anything else you'd like to add, Sergeant?
[01:55:08.049 --> 01:55:08.290]  You know...
[01:55:09.628 --> 01:55:14.572]  I know there's a lot more military men and women that are out there that are listening to this.
[01:55:15.713 --> 01:55:19.276]  And you know what you did.
[01:55:20.637 --> 01:55:22.759]  Serve your conscience, not your orders.
[01:55:23.900 --> 01:55:25.942]  Just talk to somebody about it.
[01:55:27.984 --> 01:55:28.324]  That's all.
[01:55:30.091 --> 01:55:35.194]  All right, let's talk to Fred in Philadelphia, then Stavros, Ishmael, and others.
[01:55:35.474 --> 01:55:36.034]  Fred, go ahead.
[01:55:36.054 --> 01:55:36.555]  You're on the air.
[01:55:36.815 --> 01:55:37.835]  Yeah, great show.
[01:55:37.975 --> 01:55:41.137]  I just wanted to know this one question from the guest.
[01:55:42.218 --> 01:55:48.161]  How do they organize the embedded press in Iraq to control the output of them?
[01:55:49.202 --> 01:55:49.622]  That's all.
[01:55:50.442 --> 01:55:50.863]  Thank you.
[01:55:52.223 --> 01:55:52.584]  Sergeant?
[01:55:53.364 --> 01:55:53.604]  Yeah.
[01:55:53.804 --> 01:55:56.586]  Let me tell you about the embedded reporters.
[01:55:58.324 --> 01:56:05.306]  I thought they were doing an outstanding job until I got home and I actually read the propaganda that they had produced.
[01:56:06.367 --> 01:56:15.289]  It got so bad that one of our embedded reporters actually wanted to go home because he was witnessing a lot of the civilian casualties.
[01:56:16.529 --> 01:56:25.992]  The reports that I've read about what my battalion did over there, what this embedded reporter wrote is nothing.
[01:56:26.724 --> 01:56:28.005]  To what actually took place.
[01:56:28.826 --> 01:56:32.249]  So I've been pretty... And who was that embedded reporter?
[01:56:34.411 --> 01:56:38.114]  He was... Can I give his name?
[01:56:38.314 --> 01:56:38.594]  Yes.
[01:56:40.175 --> 01:56:40.576]  Are you sure?
[01:56:40.896 --> 01:56:42.077]  Yes, we give their names here.
[01:56:42.497 --> 01:56:42.858]  Okay.
[01:56:44.279 --> 01:56:47.562]  He was with the Ron Harris.
[01:56:47.782 --> 01:56:48.522]  He was with the St.
[01:56:48.562 --> 01:56:49.623]  Louis Dispatch.
[01:56:53.006 --> 01:56:54.988]  And have you ever seen Mr. North?
[01:56:55.925 --> 01:56:56.566]  Mr. North?
[01:56:56.866 --> 01:56:57.566]  Oliver North.
[01:56:59.468 --> 01:57:06.074]  No, I had heard about his ramblings there in Iraq, but I never actually met him, no.
[01:57:06.994 --> 01:57:10.417]  Talk about the CIA being the implanted reporters and better reporters.
[01:57:11.018 --> 01:57:13.420]  Let's talk to Stavros in Canada.
[01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:14.260]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:57:14.300 --> 01:57:14.681]  Go ahead.
[01:57:15.361 --> 01:57:15.822]  Hi, gentlemen.
[01:57:15.842 --> 01:57:16.302]  How are you doing?
[01:57:16.502 --> 01:57:16.743]  Fine.
[01:57:16.783 --> 01:57:17.123]  Go ahead.
[01:57:17.723 --> 01:57:23.128]  Yes, on the subject of shooting civilians, up here in Canada on early April,
[01:57:23.995 --> 01:57:32.539]  I was witness to the Canadian military using artillery pieces for target practice in a Canadian park.
[01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:35.681]  Now, I took a picture of this, and I have it here.
[01:57:35.701 --> 01:57:36.461]  I can send it to you.
[01:57:37.121 --> 01:57:43.184]  Now, I stuck around, and I saw other civilians coming to talk to the military, saying, oh, are you guys going to do a parade or something?
[01:57:44.025 --> 01:57:46.386]  And what I heard the response from the military was this.
[01:57:46.546 --> 01:57:53.509]  They said, and I quote, oh, we're merely doing this just in case there are any rioting terrorists
[01:57:54.028 --> 01:57:56.210]  Come inside the city and try and hide inside the park.
[01:57:57.611 --> 01:57:58.912]  That's what they said, word for word.
[01:58:01.054 --> 01:58:09.440]  So in case there's any demonstrations, because in this particular park, Queens Park, they have the provincial legislature, and there are usually demonstrations there.
[01:58:11.262 --> 01:58:12.863]  And they're practicing with artillery?
[01:58:13.183 --> 01:58:13.504]  Yes, sir.
[01:58:13.524 --> 01:58:14.384]  They were shooting blanks.
[01:58:14.925 --> 01:58:16.206]  How large are these pieces?
[01:58:16.886 --> 01:58:18.127]  I believe this one is a 75mm pack howitzer.
[01:58:21.596 --> 01:58:24.539]  Is that the good thing to use on the demonstrators, a howitzer?
[01:58:26.161 --> 01:58:26.902]  I don't believe so.
[01:58:27.082 --> 01:58:30.386]  I mean, that would kill quite a lot of people.
[01:58:30.426 --> 01:58:31.547]  Well, that's the plan.
[01:58:31.867 --> 01:58:32.468]  Well, thank you.
[01:58:32.488 --> 01:58:33.049]  Thank you for the call.
[01:58:33.069 --> 01:58:36.253]  We'll do five more minutes with our guests, take a few more calls on the other side.
[01:58:36.273 --> 01:58:40.537]  We've got another guest coming up, the strange life of Nick Burr.
[01:58:44.818 --> 01:58:45.498]  Hello, folks.

[01:59:50.352 --> 01:59:51.012]  Big Brother.
[01:59:51.673 --> 01:59:52.734]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:53.435 --> 01:59:54.556]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:55.216 --> 01:59:56.017]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.778 --> 01:59:58.699]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:58.719 --> 02:00:02.163]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.523 --> 02:00:06.647]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:08.208 --> 02:00:09.369]  All right, my friends.
[02:00:09.409 --> 02:00:14.194]  You're now into hour number three of this Friday Transmission Against Tyranny.
[02:00:15.931 --> 02:00:33.377]  Coming up, we have William Bunch of the Philadelphia Daily News on the Berg beheading and his article, Berg Met with Shady Iraqi, which exposes the Berg teamed up in Baghdad with an ex-Philippine man who led a controversial group of Iraq expatriates encouraged by the U.S.
[02:00:33.417 --> 02:00:40.619]  government even as he faced deportation for his role in a Russian immigrant crime ring selling millions of vials used for crack.
[02:00:41.519 --> 02:00:42.381]  And then we have him with us.
[02:00:42.461 --> 02:00:44.444]  Two of the hijackers now, not one.
[02:00:44.484 --> 02:00:49.473]  And we have him working at Abu Ghraib Prison and this young man dropping out of college to go...
[02:00:50.510 --> 02:00:51.831]  Help people worldwide.
[02:00:52.031 --> 02:00:55.414]  Very suspicious, and we're sad that he died, if that video's even real.
[02:00:56.095 --> 02:01:04.661]  But let's take two final calls for our guest, Staff Sergeant Jimmy Massey, who has come out and told the world, Sacramento, we broke the story, I killed innocent people for our government.
[02:01:05.542 --> 02:01:07.264]  Ishmael, a lot of calls from Canada.
[02:01:07.704 --> 02:01:09.846]  You're on the air, and then we'll try to cram Kenny in here.
[02:01:09.906 --> 02:01:10.706]  Go ahead, Ishmael.
[02:01:10.946 --> 02:01:16.051]  My question for Mr. Massey in regards to the choice to do what he did in his battalion.
[02:01:16.211 --> 02:01:17.692]  Were they on drugs when they chose to do this?
[02:01:19.198 --> 02:01:22.980]  Well, no, it's the training, and it's the setup, and it's the intelligence they're given.
[02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:23.800]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:01:25.801 --> 02:01:32.165]  Basically, from the moment that you arrived at Marine Corps boot camp, the dehumanization process begins.
[02:01:33.105 --> 02:01:44.291]  So if you take a bunch of 17- to 22-year-olds, and you put them through a rigorous boot camp and continue on with their training,
[02:01:44.953 --> 02:01:48.915]  And everything is emphasized on dehumanization.
[02:01:49.115 --> 02:01:53.277]  Well, look, if you look at the Marine Corps training, it is identical to what Colts do.
[02:01:54.458 --> 02:01:54.798]  Okay.
[02:01:55.758 --> 02:01:57.579]  Do you agree with that, Mr. Massey?
[02:01:58.120 --> 02:01:58.320]  Yes.
[02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:00.081]  Thank you.
[02:02:00.201 --> 02:02:00.461]  Thank you.
[02:02:00.781 --> 02:02:05.103]  Everybody should read All Is Quiet on the Western Front, written by a World War I veteran.
[02:02:05.343 --> 02:02:07.284]  It sounds exactly like what our guest is saying.
[02:02:08.425 --> 02:02:08.685]  Okay.
[02:02:09.711 --> 02:02:20.273]  They take a young man who no longer needs mommy and daddy and who hasn't gotten bound to a woman yet, who's in that spot in their life, and the Prussians invented this.
[02:02:20.573 --> 02:02:23.253]  The Prussians bragged that it was programming.
[02:02:24.133 --> 02:02:25.454]  Were you aware of that, Mr. Massey?
[02:02:26.054 --> 02:02:26.534]  Not then.
[02:02:26.554 --> 02:02:34.135]  I didn't become aware of it until I was out on recruiting duty where I was reintroduced back to the civilian world.
[02:02:35.155 --> 02:02:38.736]  And then my last year, I had an epiphany
[02:02:39.341 --> 02:02:42.223]  And I woke up and I was like, what in the heck am I doing?
[02:02:42.743 --> 02:02:43.684]  Let's talk to Kenny.
[02:02:44.525 --> 02:02:46.006]  Kenny, you're on the air.
[02:02:46.066 --> 02:02:46.326]  Go ahead.
[02:02:46.346 --> 02:02:47.047]  Where are you calling from?
[02:02:47.307 --> 02:02:48.528]  I'm calling from Kansas City.
[02:02:48.808 --> 02:02:49.668]  I'm a Gulf War vet.
[02:02:49.708 --> 02:02:52.590]  I served in the Army from 85 through 91 as a tanker.
[02:02:53.551 --> 02:03:06.841]  And I guess I'm just really disturbed that the military is no longer training people that you have a right and a moral obligation to disobey unlawful and unconstitutional orders and you never shoot civilians or people with .50 calibers.
[02:03:06.881 --> 02:03:07.181]  That's for...
[02:03:07.918 --> 02:03:10.480]  PCs, tanks, heavy equipment, that kind of stuff.
[02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:14.064]  What kind of madness is going on in our country these days and in our military?
[02:03:17.307 --> 02:03:18.648]  Any comments, Sergeant?
[02:03:19.389 --> 02:03:19.649]  Sir?
[02:03:20.850 --> 02:03:24.353]  Yeah, that's why I'm here, because I want the same answers.
[02:03:25.474 --> 02:03:28.437]  And that's just another part of me patching up another part of my soul.
[02:03:28.871 --> 02:03:42.859]  Well, like I said, I'm proud of you, and I guess I'm equally ashamed because I would just think I would hope more people like Michael and you would stand up and say, you know what, this is wrong, this is immoral, and I will not do this, I will not obey this.
[02:03:42.979 --> 02:03:43.580]  I wouldn't have done it.
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:45.161]  I would have told them, no, I'm out of here.
[02:03:45.181 --> 02:03:53.125]  Well, now we're going to have a new national draft of women, too, and we're going to, I guess, be forced to go do this and breathe all the uranium.
[02:03:53.866 --> 02:03:57.448]  Last question, are the troops aware of the uranium and how dangerous it is?
[02:03:58.689 --> 02:04:02.293]  No, I didn't become aware of what it does to you.
[02:04:02.734 --> 02:04:05.517]  How I became aware of it was reading a Rolling Stones magazine.
[02:04:06.138 --> 02:04:14.288]  And then I started asking around to some of the tankers and other members that I knew that were around me constantly and some of the artillery.
[02:04:15.024 --> 02:04:26.653]  And they began to explain to me, and I basically said to myself, holy crap, this is some pretty serious stuff.
[02:04:27.053 --> 02:04:40.523]  So every time you're in and around a tank that has been disabled, or you're out on the battlefield where these bombs have landed, or these shells, you know... Tell you what, we've got another guest coming up, but stay there.
[02:04:40.543 --> 02:04:41.723]  I want to end this on the other side.
[02:04:42.044 --> 02:04:43.184]  We'll bring our next guest up.
[02:04:43.405 --> 02:04:43.805]  Stay with us.
[02:04:45.885 --> 02:04:47.407]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:04:47.567 --> 02:04:48.709]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:04:48.889 --> 02:04:52.294]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:04:52.414 --> 02:04:52.855]  Phenol.
[02:04:53.155 --> 02:05:00.224]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:05:00.765 --> 02:05:04.669]  The TA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:05:04.769 --> 02:05:05.230]  Fragrance?
[02:05:05.610 --> 02:05:10.355]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:05:10.495 --> 02:05:15.180]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[02:05:15.420 --> 02:05:17.883]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[02:05:18.223 --> 02:05:21.625]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:05:21.766 --> 02:05:25.348]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:05:25.528 --> 02:05:27.890]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:05:28.050 --> 02:05:28.931]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:05:29.051 --> 02:05:38.797]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.
[02:05:38.998 --> 02:05:41.519]  Call Cal Bend toll free, 1-800-340-7091 or visit calbendpuresoap.com.
[02:05:45.996 --> 02:05:47.497]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:05:47.677 --> 02:05:50.758]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:05:50.898 --> 02:05:54.819]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:05:54.859 --> 02:05:59.081]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:05:59.421 --> 02:06:03.202]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:06:03.282 --> 02:06:05.183]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:06:05.323 --> 02:06:08.644]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:06:08.684 --> 02:06:09.765]  The medical bills...
[02:06:11.386 --> 02:06:13.427]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:06:13.567 --> 02:06:16.608]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:06:16.788 --> 02:06:19.630]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:06:20.130 --> 02:06:26.233]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:06:26.773 --> 02:06:27.494]  We're good to go.
[02:06:27.514 --> 02:06:27.995]  We're good to go.
[02:06:45.297 --> 02:06:48.559]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:06:48.639 --> 02:06:52.821]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:06:53.061 --> 02:06:55.862]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:06:56.042 --> 02:06:58.444]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:06:58.644 --> 02:07:07.288]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:07:07.468 --> 02:07:08.829]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:07:09.009 --> 02:07:13.131]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:07:13.131 --> 02:07:13.691]  We're good to go.
[02:07:32.466 --> 02:07:35.567]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:07:35.687 --> 02:07:36.967]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:58.078 --> 02:08:00.584]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:00.945 --> 02:08:03.651]  Crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[02:08:05.174 --> 02:08:10.898]  We're about to be talking to a Philadelphia Daily News reporter who broke a very important story.
[02:08:11.419 --> 02:08:12.920]  Berg met with Shadi Araki.
[02:08:13.340 --> 02:08:26.069]  You tie this in with now connections to two hijackers working in Abu Ghraib prison, being in coalition custody, leaving college with good grades to go help people, the quiet American.
[02:08:26.650 --> 02:08:28.531]  Classic intelligence background M.O.
[02:08:28.611 --> 02:08:30.232]  I'm just saying there should be an investigation of that.
[02:08:30.632 --> 02:08:34.115]  We'll be talking to the reporter who broke a major story on this last week.
[02:08:35.043 --> 02:08:35.624]  We're good to go.
[02:08:58.920 --> 02:09:00.661]  Yeah, actually I'd like to read a quote.
[02:09:26.232 --> 02:09:26.752]  Real fast.
[02:09:27.212 --> 02:09:30.513]  We must respect innocent life to achieve peace.
[02:09:31.553 --> 02:09:38.175]  That quote was made by President Bush two days ago over the Israeli and Palestinian incident.
[02:09:39.235 --> 02:09:40.835]  What in the hell is he talking about?
[02:09:43.556 --> 02:09:47.557]  We just killed innocent civilians over in Iraq by the hundreds, the thousands.
[02:09:48.368 --> 02:09:51.950]  And he's talking about we must respect innocent life to achieve peace.
[02:09:51.970 --> 02:09:56.013]  Yeah, they're blowing up a wedding, killing 40, and then the Israelis do something smaller.
[02:09:56.093 --> 02:09:58.295]  It's incredible.
[02:09:58.355 --> 02:10:03.498]  Well, Sergeant, anytime you've got anything you want to bring up on the show, you've got my producer's number.
[02:10:04.058 --> 02:10:06.200]  And God bless you, and take care.
[02:10:06.220 --> 02:10:07.121]  Thank you, sir.
[02:10:07.421 --> 02:10:07.701]  You bet.
[02:10:08.738 --> 02:10:14.363]  Wow, that was an incredible hour interview with Sergeant Massey.
[02:10:14.663 --> 02:10:30.056]  And now for another first hour, we have Kyle Hens, co-founder of 9-11 Citizens Watch, a contributor to unansweredquestions.org, and Christopher Broder, investigative journalist and activist who confronted Giuliani in the 11th public hearing of the September 11th Commission.
[02:10:30.576 --> 02:10:31.917]  And we have Staff Sergeant Massey.
[02:10:31.937 --> 02:10:37.422]  And now we have Philadelphia Daily News reporter, William Bunche,
[02:10:38.215 --> 02:10:40.197]  And Mr. Bunch, it's great to have you on with us.
[02:10:40.217 --> 02:10:41.118]  Thanks for taking time out.
[02:10:41.678 --> 02:10:42.899]  Oh, thanks for having me on the show.
[02:10:42.939 --> 02:10:43.920]  It's my pleasure.
[02:10:44.541 --> 02:10:48.204]  Tell folks your newspaper's website or how they can read your fine columns.
[02:10:48.824 --> 02:10:49.885]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:10:49.905 --> 02:10:56.071]  We've been given a decent amount of coverage to what's going on in Iraq from our own kind of unique perspective.
[02:10:56.131 --> 02:11:01.756]  And you can find it on Philly, which folks outside of here don't always know how to spell it.
[02:11:01.916 --> 02:11:03.277]  It's P-H-I-L-L-Y.
[02:11:05.686 --> 02:11:07.347]  And look for the daily news.
[02:11:07.407 --> 02:11:12.752]  Click on the daily news, because otherwise you might get a bunch of stuff in the sold-out inquirer, and that's not going to help you out too much.
[02:11:12.772 --> 02:11:20.037]  So look for the daily news when you go on the Jilly.com website and look for our coverage of what's going on over in Iraq.
[02:11:20.378 --> 02:11:21.498]  Okay, fantastic.
[02:11:23.604 --> 02:11:24.605]  I mean, you're a reporter.
[02:11:24.665 --> 02:11:27.068]  You stick to the absolute facts that you have.
[02:11:27.268 --> 02:11:37.740]  But before we get into your story, I mean, now connected to two hijackers, Nick Berg, leaves an Ivy League school to, quote, travel the world, classic intelligence operative M.O.
[02:11:38.200 --> 02:11:40.143]  You know, quit school with, you know, high grades.
[02:11:41.103 --> 02:11:42.744]  Working at Abu Ghraib prison.
[02:11:43.425 --> 02:11:44.546]  In coalition custody.
[02:11:44.566 --> 02:11:45.446]  They tried to deny it.
[02:11:45.486 --> 02:11:46.147]  Now it's admitted.
[02:11:46.167 --> 02:11:46.907]  13 days.
[02:11:47.227 --> 02:11:49.229]  Gets released suddenly in al-Qaeda hands.
[02:11:49.469 --> 02:11:50.970]  Now we find out it wasn't al-Qaeda.
[02:11:51.350 --> 02:11:55.593]  MSNBC is saying that this Zawari guy died three months ago in northern Iraq.
[02:11:56.073 --> 02:11:59.695]  I mean, this story has got more holes in it than a sieve.
[02:11:59.795 --> 02:12:05.659]  And then you bring forward your article with him with these shady characters with intelligence agency connections.
[02:12:06.659 --> 02:12:14.124]  With the drug trafficking connections, with the immigrant smuggling connections, I mean, this is amazing.
[02:12:14.204 --> 02:12:18.566]  How do we make heads or tails of all of this, Mr. Bunch?
[02:12:19.427 --> 02:12:21.608]  Well, I mean, it's hard to know what to make of it.
[02:12:21.748 --> 02:12:24.509]  I mean, I would just caution everybody.
[02:12:24.689 --> 02:12:34.575]  I think finding out what Nick Berg was all about and what he was doing in Iraq is going to be a time-consuming process, and it's not something we're going to
[02:12:35.203 --> 02:12:36.844]  I think it worked out overnight.
[02:12:36.864 --> 02:12:50.149]  The only thing that seems clear is the original storyline that he was just over there scoring business opportunities.
[02:12:51.589 --> 02:12:58.952]  I don't even want to say it's false, but the more you check into it, as I've done, the more questions
[02:12:59.827 --> 02:13:01.468]  To get raised and go unanswered.
[02:13:01.508 --> 02:13:08.431]  And so there's a lot, I mean, there's just a lot of questions about who Nick Berg, what he was really all about.
[02:13:08.971 --> 02:13:10.351]  You know, was he really pro-war?
[02:13:10.391 --> 02:13:12.833]  Was he anti-war like his father?
[02:13:13.433 --> 02:13:14.733]  You know, where else did he travel?
[02:13:14.793 --> 02:13:16.314]  How many times did he go to Israel?
[02:13:16.374 --> 02:13:17.675]  What other countries did he visit?
[02:13:18.955 --> 02:13:24.497]  You know, somebody had an article on the Internet with, I think, 50 unanswered questions.
[02:13:24.537 --> 02:13:25.778]  And to be honest, there's more than that.
[02:13:26.821 --> 02:13:29.948]  Yeah, well, we've said there's 50 anomalies.
[02:13:30.088 --> 02:13:32.253]  Anomalies, right.
[02:13:32.614 --> 02:13:35.039]  And two weeks ago, now more are out there, but...
[02:13:36.613 --> 02:13:40.434]  I mean, look, he has the classic... I mean, we have to speculate because everybody's speculating.
[02:13:40.454 --> 02:13:42.874]  We have a bunch of facts but don't know the answers.
[02:13:43.334 --> 02:13:46.895]  But, I mean, he has the classic intelligence agent M.O.
[02:13:47.235 --> 02:13:56.037]  The country's flooding full of private contractors who are really CIA and defense intelligence and Mossad and Shin Bet and everything else.
[02:13:56.657 --> 02:13:58.877]  And this guy's got the classic M.O.
[02:13:58.897 --> 02:13:59.077]  of that.
[02:13:59.137 --> 02:14:01.698]  I can't say he was, but very, very...
[02:14:02.972 --> 02:14:05.255]  Yeah, I don't want to jump to any conclusions.
[02:14:05.315 --> 02:14:20.251]  That's not my M.O., but, you know, I will say, I mean, the fact that his job or his self-styled job was to climb these radio and communications towers, including, as you mentioned, the one at Abu Ghraib...
[02:14:21.690 --> 02:14:23.030]  I mean, that's a red flag right there.
[02:14:23.050 --> 02:14:25.511]  That's something that needs to be checked out a little bit more, obviously.
[02:14:25.531 --> 02:14:29.473]  Yeah, it's the quiet American with his bag of tricks out helping.
[02:14:30.193 --> 02:14:33.474]  It's horrible what happened to him, if that can even be documented.
[02:14:33.514 --> 02:14:40.016]  But your article, though, really is one of the best investigations I've seen and kind of a window into this murkiness.
[02:14:40.036 --> 02:14:42.958]  Can you go over the details of your story?
[02:14:43.018 --> 02:14:44.738]  Burke met with Shady Iraqi.
[02:14:45.318 --> 02:14:48.640]  Well, that was actually kind of a follow-up story.
[02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:49.380]  We were actually...
[02:14:50.447 --> 02:15:08.440]  The Philadelphia Daily News, we were actually the first newspaper to report about Berger's connections to terrorism or Al-Qaeda suspects down in Oklahoma, including a link either indirectly or directly to Zacharias Musawi, who's an admitted member of Al-Qaeda.
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:12.803]  Well, he just, I mean, when you're on a bus, don't you just say, here's my computer, here's my password?
[02:15:13.470 --> 02:15:14.731]  Yeah, I don't think that.
[02:15:14.951 --> 02:15:19.474]  I have a serious doubt about whether that's the actual way that, yeah.
[02:15:19.654 --> 02:15:20.594]  No one does that.
[02:15:21.115 --> 02:15:21.835]  Right, right.
[02:15:22.155 --> 02:15:37.785]  Well, I mean, my general thinking, well, let me first go back and after we broke the story about the Oklahoma and the Musawi connection, that weekend there were some stories coming out of Baghdad.
[02:15:37.845 --> 02:15:41.407]  You know, unfortunately, we don't have people over there from the Daily News, which we did, but
[02:15:42.460 --> 02:15:59.853]  Just reading the AP story that came out of Baghdad that weekend, they made a reference to a Philadelphian being an Iraqi-born person who lived in Philadelphia who had moved back, and being somewhat parochial like most newspapers, whenever we see the word Philadelphia we get excited.
[02:15:59.873 --> 02:16:01.455]  So I said, who is this guy?
[02:16:01.555 --> 02:16:03.156]  And I started checking into it, and
[02:16:04.025 --> 02:16:06.867]  You know, I just couldn't believe all the weird connections that this guy had.
[02:16:06.887 --> 02:16:15.874]  His name is, well, his name was quoted in most papers as Aziz Al-Taee, T-A-E-E, but that's not his real name.
[02:16:15.894 --> 02:16:20.298]  He adopted that a few years ago for reasons that, when you check out his background, seem pretty obvious.
[02:16:20.338 --> 02:16:30.906]  His actual name is Aziz Khaduri Aziz, or Aziz K. Aziz, and he'd come to the United States from Iraq about 20 years ago,
[02:16:32.268 --> 02:16:39.893]  Seemingly a successful businessman who opened a chain of electronics stores in kind of bad neighborhoods in Philadelphia.
[02:16:39.913 --> 02:16:50.540]  It turns out he has a very shady past, including he pleaded guilty back in 1994 to being part of a huge ring that was distributing crack vials.
[02:16:50.900 --> 02:16:55.263]  Not the actual crack itself, but the vials that people used to sell crack.
[02:16:55.703 --> 02:17:00.066]  Most of his partners in this enterprise were Soviet...
[02:17:01.611 --> 02:17:04.193]  By the way, I just typed that name in.
[02:17:04.313 --> 02:17:05.533]  That's a known CIA front group.
[02:17:05.553 --> 02:17:05.913]  Well, absolutely.
[02:17:05.933 --> 02:17:06.354]  I mean, it's hard.
[02:17:06.394 --> 02:17:08.195]  You have to follow the border directors, but it does go back to...
[02:17:31.801 --> 02:17:35.703]  It's one of these government-funded Iraqi opposition groups.
[02:17:35.763 --> 02:17:37.824]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:17:38.684 --> 02:17:49.509]  And I'm sure your listeners remember the Clear Channel-sponsored rallies for America, the so-called pro-troop or pro-war rallies that were held a year ago.
[02:17:49.529 --> 02:17:49.589]  Yes.
[02:17:51.526 --> 02:18:07.487]  People from this group, the Iraqi American Council, got training from our State Department to go to these rallies, to go on Fox News and to go on other channels and talk about how terrible Saddam was and how much better the world would be.
[02:18:08.537 --> 02:18:14.859]  So we've got this obvious intel operative, and he's involved in all this shady stuff, and then, oh, he's buddies with Berg!
[02:18:14.879 --> 02:18:17.260]  Uh, yeah, I mean, we're not reporting that, uh,
[02:18:33.106 --> 02:18:35.447]  That's your jump, that he's an intel operative.
[02:18:35.467 --> 02:18:41.589]  But yeah, I mean, he definitely has, like we said in our story, he definitely has a shady past, no doubt about it.
[02:18:41.909 --> 02:18:43.930]  He definitely has these government connections.
[02:18:43.970 --> 02:18:48.011]  He definitely has these... Five News, Third Channel, State Department.
[02:18:48.351 --> 02:18:53.393]  Right, right, right.
[02:18:53.994 --> 02:19:00.536]  And then, because of his criminal record, however, I guess this is typical government left-hand, not knowing what the right's doing, at the same time he's getting...
[02:19:01.264 --> 02:19:02.625]  Stay right there.
[02:19:02.665 --> 02:19:05.407]  William Bunch, Philadelphia Daily News.
[02:19:05.427 --> 02:19:06.408]  Philly.com is the website.
[02:19:23.500 --> 02:19:32.844]  We'll come right back, and I want to get into his connection to Berg in your great article that folks can read at InfoWars.com, or you can simply link through to Philly.com.
[02:19:33.604 --> 02:19:36.586]  We'll be right back with our guest after this quick break, and we'll continue.
[02:19:36.626 --> 02:19:38.967]  We really appreciate Mr. Bunch's work on this.

[02:20:52.601 --> 02:20:53.581]  Spring has arrived.
[02:20:53.761 --> 02:20:56.722]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:20:56.942 --> 02:21:00.404]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.

[02:21:50.911 --> 02:21:55.612]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[02:21:55.853 --> 02:21:59.274]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[02:21:59.494 --> 02:22:01.974]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[02:22:02.214 --> 02:22:10.797]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.

[02:22:52.622 --> 02:22:56.923]  Just once I'd like to clean my car's leather upholstery without sliding across the seat on every turn.
[02:22:57.623 --> 02:23:02.004]  Just once I'd like to get a beautiful shine without a slick oily residue that attracts dust and dirt.
[02:23:02.604 --> 02:23:05.585]  Introducing just once the amazing non-slip protectant.

[02:23:25.294 --> 02:23:25.654]  We're good to go.
[02:23:25.674 --> 02:23:26.114]  We're good to go.
[02:23:52.203 --> 02:23:55.186]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[02:23:56.247 --> 02:24:01.192]  All right, I don't know how long our guest could stay with us, but I'd like him to into the next segment so we can take some calls.
[02:24:01.232 --> 02:24:03.975]  And I would ask callers to direct some questions or comments to him.
[02:24:05.142 --> 02:24:09.307]  Because we don't screen calls here, but when I do have guests on, it'd be nice if you talked to the guests.
[02:24:09.327 --> 02:24:09.687]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:09.707 --> 02:24:22.863]  We haven't even gotten into the meat and potatoes yet on this incredible article, Berg Met with Shady Iraqi, and there's been other reports by William Butch, the Philadelphia Daily News, philly.com.
[02:24:23.721 --> 02:24:25.282]  Yeah, well...
[02:24:50.862 --> 02:25:03.109]  Aziz, as we call him, appears, according to his version of events, and, you know, everything that has to do with Iraq, you have to quantify somebody's version of what's really happening.
[02:25:03.149 --> 02:25:11.634]  But Aziz's version basically has him being the last person to speak with Nick Berg before he disappeared.
[02:25:11.694 --> 02:25:18.678]  He says that on April 10th... Now, supposedly, you know, when Berg was in whoever's custody, whether it was...
[02:25:20.878 --> 02:25:22.239]  American or Iraqi custody.
[02:25:22.259 --> 02:25:35.349]  Supposedly, then he went to Baghdad and checked into a hotel for four days.
[02:25:35.369 --> 02:25:43.555]  Resumed his connection with Aziz, who I don't know if he mentioned in the narrative here, but was hooked up with Berg in Iraq as his business partner.
[02:25:43.595 --> 02:25:46.157]  They formed a company called Babylon Towers that was
[02:25:47.067 --> 02:25:49.511]  It's supposedly going to fix radio towers in Iraq.
[02:25:50.172 --> 02:25:56.403]  And on April 10th, which was when Nick Berg left the hotel, almost the last time anybody saw him...
[02:25:58.160 --> 02:26:02.983]  He said Nick Berg called him and told him he'd gotten a ride with a couple people.
[02:26:03.043 --> 02:26:04.804]  He was going to Jordan to leave the country.
[02:26:05.324 --> 02:26:06.765]  Now, I know this.
[02:26:07.065 --> 02:26:18.972]  In America, the cops will be talking to this guy, the last person you're with, and, oh, I saw him get a ride, and, oh, I do stuff for the State Department, and I get these rallies together, and I'm involved in shipping out...
[02:26:20.373 --> 02:26:28.300]  Crack vials, and I'm doing all this, and Mr. Berg's involved with some hijackers with passwords, but there's nothing suspicious here.
[02:26:28.761 --> 02:26:30.662]  This is all just, I mean, this is incredible.
[02:26:30.682 --> 02:26:33.765]  Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[02:26:34.326 --> 02:26:35.567]  Yeah, I mean, you're right.
[02:26:35.627 --> 02:26:41.072]  Usually the last person to see somebody alive, you know, is question.
[02:26:41.272 --> 02:26:44.595]  This guy needs to be under the hot lights with some guys asking him some questions.
[02:26:46.673 --> 02:26:49.375]  Yeah, and we don't know if that's been done, although it doesn't seem like it.
[02:26:49.395 --> 02:26:52.337]  He seems to be operating freely over there in Baghdad.
[02:26:53.018 --> 02:26:54.779]  He also made an interesting claim.
[02:26:54.819 --> 02:27:10.651]  He claimed that Aziz is in the cell phone business, and he has claimed that he's actually seen Nick Berg's cell phone records and that his cell phone was used, I think, as late as April 19th, which would be, remember now, nine days after he disappeared.
[02:27:10.671 --> 02:27:10.711]  So...
[02:27:12.625 --> 02:27:16.247]  That's an interesting and unacclaimed fact there, too.
[02:27:17.187 --> 02:27:30.312]  So, yeah, there's a lot of questions about... Well, he's trying to create space for the government, speculating here, from, you know, he gets released and suddenly an al-Qaeda hands, and now they admit it's not al-Qaeda.
[02:27:30.332 --> 02:27:31.473]  I mean, it's this whole thing.
[02:27:31.493 --> 02:27:40.757]  Well, the latest, I mean, I think you're referring to the story that came out today, which is very curious, in which you have some Iraqi officials now claiming that...
[02:27:41.776 --> 02:27:44.300]  Yeah, this is... But then it comes out now that says that...
[02:27:58.720 --> 02:28:11.390]  They've already released two out of these four people, and they might be releasing the other, so... Well, it's like 20 times they found sarin gas and later say it isn't sarin gas, and then I have arguments with people that, oh, yeah, they found the sarin gas.
[02:28:11.450 --> 02:28:13.371]  I mean, this is all propaganda.
[02:28:13.972 --> 02:28:17.414]  This is classic propaganda where they put a story out and then retract it later.
[02:28:17.875 --> 02:28:19.676]  How many times did they kill Chemical Ali?
[02:28:19.716 --> 02:28:21.537]  Like five or something?
[02:28:21.597 --> 02:28:25.781]  Well, I mean, the guy supposedly saw Nick Berg's head off MSNBC.
[02:28:25.801 --> 02:28:27.402]  The Pentagon said it was dead three months ago.
[02:28:28.078 --> 02:28:29.198]  Yeah, I'll talk to Ali.
[02:28:29.238 --> 02:28:30.699]  He knows what's up with that.
[02:28:32.659 --> 02:28:39.941]  Yeah, and I know the guy cutting his head off isn't hobbling, and it sure has a lot of mobility to be, you know, for one leg.
[02:28:39.961 --> 02:28:43.382]  Yeah, that didn't add up.
[02:28:43.402 --> 02:28:46.963]  There's a lot of things about the video that don't add up.
[02:28:47.043 --> 02:28:49.164]  Yeah, like not a lot of blood.
[02:28:49.184 --> 02:28:53.285]  I mean, I've been in a slaughterhouse, and you cut a large mammal's head off, folks.
[02:28:53.305 --> 02:28:54.245]  You better stand back.
[02:28:55.277 --> 02:28:56.899]  I don't want to get too graphic here.
[02:28:56.919 --> 02:28:57.919]  Have you seen the video?
[02:28:59.300 --> 02:29:00.521]  Yes, I have, unfortunately.
[02:29:00.561 --> 02:29:01.943]  I mean, it's pretty gristly.
[02:29:02.003 --> 02:29:02.783]  Yeah, we've seen it.
[02:29:02.803 --> 02:29:04.124]  We had it up for a while, took it down.
[02:29:05.505 --> 02:29:05.826]  I don't know.
[02:29:05.866 --> 02:29:06.927]  I go back and forth on it.
[02:29:06.967 --> 02:29:08.308]  Well, we've got a break, sir.
[02:29:08.328 --> 02:29:09.949]  Can we come back and take a few calls for you?
[02:29:10.750 --> 02:29:11.190]  Absolutely.
[02:29:11.210 --> 02:29:11.770]  I have a few minutes.
[02:29:11.831 --> 02:29:12.111]  Go ahead.
[02:29:12.231 --> 02:29:13.052]  Okay, let's do that.
[02:29:13.292 --> 02:29:16.955]  We'll come back and go to Rodney and Chris and...
[02:29:18.451 --> 02:29:20.973]  Fred in Philadelphia and John in Florida and others.
[02:29:21.593 --> 02:29:22.954]  Toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[02:29:23.054 --> 02:29:29.998]  And it's great to have reporters like William Bunch out there from the Philadelphia Daily News.
[02:29:30.418 --> 02:29:32.760]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[02:29:36.162 --> 02:29:37.062]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.543 --> 02:29:39.164]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:40.064 --> 02:29:42.746]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:45.996 --> 02:29:54.258]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:29:54.518 --> 02:29:58.859]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:29:59.159 --> 02:30:08.081]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:30:08.281 --> 02:30:11.902]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:30:12.202 --> 02:30:17.228]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:30:17.529 --> 02:30:24.237]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[02:30:24.733 --> 02:30:25.394]  What about you?
[02:30:26.034 --> 02:30:31.400]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:30:46.132 --> 02:30:50.495]  Most of us have had a cafe we frequented because the service was so wonderful or the food was so great.
[02:30:50.655 --> 02:30:57.699]  The Silver Bear Cafe understands this philosophy and has incorporated these ideals into a website that offers food for thought to nourish the mind.
[02:30:57.999 --> 02:31:04.883]  Membership in the Bear consists of a large and growing group of patriots who, like you, realize there are things in this great country that need changing right away.
[02:31:05.203 --> 02:31:12.729]  The Silver Bear Cafe provides you with an income opportunity that will provide you and your family with an ongoing revenue stream in return for simply spreading the message.
[02:31:13.089 --> 02:31:19.034]  So many of you have been trying to get the message out individually, but collectively our voices are strong and cannot be silenced.
[02:31:19.474 --> 02:31:24.618]  Membership in the Bear will teach you the secrets of financial freedom, how the runaway government is crushing the American dream.
[02:31:24.938 --> 02:31:28.839]  Why wars are played out across the globe, the fractional reserve system, etc.
[02:31:29.040 --> 02:31:31.680]  Where we're headed and what you can do to prepare yourselves.
[02:31:32.041 --> 02:31:33.121]  Knowledge is power.
[02:31:33.361 --> 02:31:38.283]  Feed your mind and feed your financial independence with a visit to silverbearcafe.com.
[02:31:38.423 --> 02:31:40.484]  That's silverbearcafe.com.
[02:31:40.624 --> 02:31:43.845]  Do it today and preserve this country's greatness for generations to come.
[02:31:45.786 --> 02:31:47.266]  You never thought it would happen here.
[02:31:47.626 --> 02:31:52.568]  There is a way to protect yourself and your family from nuclear, biological and chemical threats.
[02:31:52.930 --> 02:32:02.038]  Clean Air Technologies designs and builds subterranean concrete shelters, steel shelter systems, and safe rooms throughout the United States that are NBC protected.
[02:32:02.358 --> 02:32:06.682]  These hardened facilities can protect you from man-made as well as natural disasters.
[02:32:06.942 --> 02:32:12.187]  Call the experts from Clean Air Technologies toll-free at 866-5-BUNKER.
[02:32:12.407 --> 02:32:15.609]  That's 866-528-6537.
[02:32:15.870 --> 02:32:19.633]  And they'll help you find the design plan that will increase your family's survivability.
[02:32:20.063 --> 02:32:20.603]  We're good to go.
[02:32:51.032 --> 02:32:51.492]  All right!
[02:33:09.130 --> 02:33:10.591]  We're back live, my friends.
[02:33:10.611 --> 02:33:24.719]  Thank you for joining us on this Friday, the 21st of May, 2004 edition, as we blast out on the AM and FM dials, simulcast on Global Shortwave, and the Internet at prisonplanet.tv.com and infowars.com as well.
[02:33:25.519 --> 02:33:32.263]  Before we go back to our guest, William Bunch from the Philadelphia Daily News, and take some calls here from people patiently holding...
[02:33:33.570 --> 02:33:38.194]  I want to encourage everybody out there to go sign up today at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:33:38.274 --> 02:33:56.250]  It's only 15 cents a day if you sign up for a year, 19 cents a day if you sign up on a monthly basis, weekly, multiple weekly usually, special TV reports I do here locally that are on the site, the best interviews, the audio interviews we do like this one right now, just a
[02:33:57.831 --> 02:34:00.432]  Every time I make a new documentary, it'll be put on the site first.
[02:34:00.892 --> 02:34:03.213]  All my videos, all ten of them, are there on the site.
[02:34:03.934 --> 02:34:05.254]  This helps us with the bandwidth.
[02:34:05.274 --> 02:34:11.757]  We kept putting it out for free everywhere, just like the New York Post wrote us up yesterday, page six doing this, and we still offer most stuff free.
[02:34:11.777 --> 02:34:22.061]  But you can't have 20 million visitors a month and have them watching videos for free, or I'm going to live on the side of the road and not have a radio show anymore because I do this separately from the radio network.
[02:34:22.621 --> 02:34:24.463]  So help us get the word out.
[02:34:24.483 --> 02:34:29.008]  To get the special weekly reports and a lot of the other information, about half the site's still free.
[02:34:29.068 --> 02:34:32.512]  But if you want to support us, prisonplanet.tv.
[02:34:32.932 --> 02:34:34.234]  Go sign up today.
[02:34:35.260 --> 02:34:47.589]  Also, I've made ten films, written a book, published a book, carry a bunch of other great books and videos, Jews, the Preservation of Firearms Ownership, great new video we're carrying called Innocence Betrayed, about tyrannical government.
[02:34:48.370 --> 02:34:50.831]  You need to have this video, folks.
[02:34:50.931 --> 02:34:55.775]  It also comes with three political pamphlets that go over the history of tyranny and how they disarm us.
[02:34:56.585 --> 02:34:57.266]  So get that.
[02:34:57.766 --> 02:35:03.973]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order via our secure, safe shopping cart.
[02:35:04.373 --> 02:35:05.174]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:35:05.194 --> 02:35:06.395]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:35:06.475 --> 02:35:11.860]  My book, 9-11, The Sentence of Tyranny, about 9-11, the truth of it, and the police state unfolding.
[02:35:21.215 --> 02:35:21.375]  224 pages, $12.
[02:35:21.415 --> 02:35:24.777]  Paul Watson's book, 1995, with 300 pages full of photos, diagrams, documents.
[02:35:24.797 --> 02:35:25.438]  The videos are $25.95.
[02:35:25.478 --> 02:35:26.859]  Order three or more of any of the ten titles.
[02:35:26.879 --> 02:35:28.660]  They drop down to $20.
[02:35:29.300 --> 02:35:30.081]  Make the call today.
[02:35:30.101 --> 02:35:30.181]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:35:30.221 --> 02:35:32.443]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:35:32.503 --> 02:35:32.603]  Okay.
[02:35:51.923 --> 02:35:59.929]  We're going to go to all these calls here in just a moment, but talking to the reporter, William Bunch, from the Philadelphia Daily News, broke the story, Berg met with Shady Iraqi.
[02:36:00.429 --> 02:36:03.131]  Any other key points you want to add before we go to these calls?
[02:36:04.432 --> 02:36:16.861]  Well, right now, in terms of further areas to be checking out, right now I'm trying to find out more about Dick Berg's time in Oklahoma, and very little has been explained about...
[02:36:18.001 --> 02:36:24.225]  What's really behind it, the so-called password on the bus story, and who he really knew and who he met down there.
[02:36:24.265 --> 02:36:26.066]  And so we're going to look into that.
[02:36:26.146 --> 02:36:35.333]  I mean, you know, there's a lot of downtime, if you look at his resume, between the time he went to college and when he turned up in Iraq, and I think that might...
[02:36:36.278 --> 02:36:39.100]  Give us some clues into what's going on with this guy.
[02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:45.844]  Yet again, just to state this, the government recruits people with high grade point averages out of the Ivy League.
[02:36:46.844 --> 02:36:50.086]  They've had a big recruiting drive for 25-year-olds to 29-year-olds.
[02:36:50.126 --> 02:36:51.967]  That's even been in State Department press releases.
[02:36:52.427 --> 02:36:53.828]  This stinks to high heaven.
[02:36:53.848 --> 02:36:54.809]  We can't say that.
[02:36:55.269 --> 02:36:57.450]  We can just say it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck.
[02:36:57.490 --> 02:36:57.971]  What is it?
[02:36:59.552 --> 02:37:01.993]  Yes, I'd love to have you back on if you can get that information.
[02:37:02.933 --> 02:37:05.415]  Who's up first here out of all these callers, Stephanie?
[02:37:09.475 --> 02:37:11.056]  Rodney in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:37:11.116 --> 02:37:11.556]  Go ahead.
[02:37:12.336 --> 02:37:13.417]  Randy, okay, go ahead.
[02:37:14.958 --> 02:37:25.963]  Yeah, well, you know, all I can say about this Berg is that, you know, if we weren't over there sticking our nose in where it didn't belong, we wouldn't have any of that happening or the POW mess that we're encountering now.
[02:37:25.983 --> 02:37:38.489]  You know, I'm just reading right now on Yahoo News about a Florida-based soldier who was found guilty today of desertion over there who objected to it and refused to go back on conscientious grounds.
[02:37:40.140 --> 02:37:41.842]  Yes, yeah, I've read about that.
[02:37:41.862 --> 02:37:43.383]  You know, you're absolutely right.
[02:37:43.403 --> 02:38:03.220]  I mean, there's no, you know, if we were not in Iraq, and clearly that was a, quote, voluntary or optional, whatever you want to call it, war, and didn't seem to be particularly necessary, and now we have these things happening, and they, you know, they're, you know, knocking America's image down.
[02:38:04.215 --> 02:38:05.296]  Around the world even lower.
[02:38:05.717 --> 02:38:08.900]  Also, they say, oh, they're volunteers, you know, these troops.
[02:38:09.420 --> 02:38:11.603]  Well, a lot of them were supposed to be in three, four years.
[02:38:11.683 --> 02:38:12.824]  Now they won't let them leave.
[02:38:13.705 --> 02:38:15.086]  So that really is a draft.
[02:38:15.327 --> 02:38:16.808]  Well, yeah, that's the point.
[02:38:16.868 --> 02:38:18.810]  And bring that up in this article, too.
[02:38:18.830 --> 02:38:23.255]  I have to move this boy, you know, because, I mean, I have yet to have any congressman say or hear...
[02:38:24.278 --> 02:38:29.841]  Any of them say that this was a war done under the Constitution, you know, with a declaration of war?
[02:38:29.861 --> 02:38:33.884]  No, the Congress was supposed to declare it, and again, this is out of control.
[02:38:33.904 --> 02:38:34.624]  Thanks for the call.
[02:38:35.465 --> 02:38:39.047]  Let's go ahead and talk to Fred in Philadelphia, where our reporter joins us from.
[02:38:39.307 --> 02:38:39.907]  Go ahead, Fred.
[02:38:40.007 --> 02:38:40.928]  Yeah, great show.
[02:38:41.468 --> 02:38:47.812]  I just wanted to call, and I have two things, two pretty pertinent things.
[02:38:49.333 --> 02:38:50.333]  I actually witnessed...
[02:38:52.189 --> 02:39:11.818]  The recruitment of a young vet around 28 years old at a local suburban library in the late 90s for the Balkans, like a specific technical job for the CIA.
[02:39:11.838 --> 02:39:21.123]  And that is the age group, that is the qualifications for intelligence community to hire people.
[02:39:22.139 --> 02:39:24.121]  You know, I don't like your conspiracy theories.
[02:39:24.181 --> 02:39:27.024]  So he's trading passwords with now two hijackers.
[02:39:27.604 --> 02:39:29.827]  So he's working in Abu Ghraib prison.
[02:39:30.167 --> 02:39:33.450]  So he's hanging out with people that are involved in all this shady stuff.
[02:39:33.510 --> 02:39:37.214]  And he's in coalition custody, and he's flying back and forth between Israel.
[02:39:37.874 --> 02:39:39.055]  I mean, come on, man.
[02:39:39.075 --> 02:39:44.801]  I bet you're the type of person that if you saw a guy in a black mask walking out of your house with your television set at 3 a.m.,
[02:39:46.422 --> 02:39:47.803]  I bet you'd think that was a robber.
[02:39:48.123 --> 02:39:49.744]  You're a conspiracy theorist, okay?
[02:39:50.225 --> 02:39:56.389]  Well, no, but the other thing is that I wanted to report that in the 90s.
[02:39:56.509 --> 02:40:01.532]  It seemed to me like there was a lot of recruitment.
[02:40:01.552 --> 02:40:09.217]  The other thing was, on Nick Berg, the occupational description of him changed in the local news in Philadelphia.
[02:40:10.774 --> 02:40:14.236]  First thing, it was simply personal characteristics they mentioned.
[02:40:14.496 --> 02:40:16.797]  Well, that was as the news was getting what the government said.
[02:40:16.817 --> 02:40:19.278]  Then reporters went out and found out the truth, like Mr. Bunch.
[02:40:19.438 --> 02:40:22.079]  Yeah, they first said he was just able to make friends.
[02:40:22.099 --> 02:40:25.820]  They didn't talk about occupational description.
[02:40:26.260 --> 02:40:32.042]  And then they had said that he was trained in marketing, without mentioning that apparently he is...
[02:40:34.321 --> 02:40:38.804]  His huge expertise was radio engineering and electrical engineering.
[02:40:38.824 --> 02:40:41.726]  And then when that comes out, that's a good point.
[02:40:41.766 --> 02:40:47.970]  We've had a lot of absconding and a lot of stonewalling by the government, Mr. Bunch.
[02:40:49.471 --> 02:40:51.093]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:40:51.213 --> 02:40:55.255]  And that's a good point, because I've been on the story since the first day.
[02:40:55.275 --> 02:40:58.998]  And the first day, as is always the case with these things, it's just,
[02:40:59.477 --> 02:41:00.318]  A matter of shock.
[02:41:00.498 --> 02:41:11.825]  And look, a couple things, and I meant to say some of this out front, is, you know, whatever his purposes were... What happened to him was horrible.
[02:41:12.065 --> 02:41:13.045]  What happened to him, two things.
[02:41:13.065 --> 02:41:15.367]  What happened to him was horrible, by all accounts.
[02:41:16.227 --> 02:41:19.469]  You know, the people who knew him were very fond of him and liked him.
[02:41:19.649 --> 02:41:25.553]  And, you know, regardless of who killed him... Yeah, it's a tragedy.
[02:41:25.593 --> 02:41:27.414]  We just shouldn't have the government lying about it.
[02:41:28.152 --> 02:41:29.053]  Right, exactly.
[02:41:29.313 --> 02:41:43.060]  You know, I mean, clearly, you know, the fact that first, you know, first that they said it was this Abu Massab, the Al-Sikari supposedly was fingered, you know, definitively by the CIA or whatever is the killer.
[02:41:43.440 --> 02:41:48.783]  And then we're hearing today that they're arresting people from a completely, you know, totally different group, the Fedayeen.
[02:41:49.083 --> 02:41:51.645]  And, you know, it's like anything else.
[02:41:51.685 --> 02:41:55.887]  I mean, you know, if that information is bogus, then what else, you know, what else aren't they telling us?
[02:41:56.627 --> 02:41:57.387]  Or are they trying to mislead us?
[02:41:57.407 --> 02:42:02.629]  And then we'll have arguments when the government admits... Powell admits those weren't mobile weapons trucks.
[02:42:03.049 --> 02:42:04.569]  Generals admitted it six months ago.
[02:42:04.589 --> 02:42:09.091]  And I still have arguments with people, William, saying those were mobile weapons trucks.
[02:42:10.411 --> 02:42:14.533]  Yeah, well, once information gets out there, it's hard to... That's been my experience.
[02:42:14.633 --> 02:42:20.894]  Once information gets published or promulgated out there, it's hard to... You know, it stays there for a long time.
[02:42:20.934 --> 02:42:25.576]  You know, even if the person who actually said it, like in this case, like Powell, even if the person who
[02:42:26.129 --> 02:42:28.675]  You know, it was the one saying information in the first place disowns it.
[02:42:29.076 --> 02:42:31.702]  People still have a hard time, you know, accepting that.
[02:42:31.782 --> 02:42:32.624]  I see that all the time.
[02:42:33.619 --> 02:42:35.120]  Yeah, let's... Thanks for the call, Fred.
[02:42:35.160 --> 02:42:36.661]  Let's talk to John in Florida.
[02:42:37.101 --> 02:42:37.881]  John, you're on the air.
[02:42:37.901 --> 02:42:39.122]  And then one more call for our guest.
[02:42:39.142 --> 02:42:39.742]  Go ahead, John.
[02:42:39.762 --> 02:42:40.663]  Howdy, Alex.
[02:42:40.743 --> 02:42:41.183]  Howdy, William.
[02:42:41.463 --> 02:42:46.286]  I'll try and restrain myself with comments and questions as to your investigative efforts here, okay?
[02:42:46.306 --> 02:42:49.908]  And I'm glad to hear that you're going to go out to Oklahoma and elsewhere on this man's trail.
[02:42:51.288 --> 02:42:53.970]  You and your comments... Let me stop you.
[02:42:53.990 --> 02:42:55.851]  Let me just tell the reporter, be very careful.
[02:42:56.911 --> 02:42:58.292]  Yeah, well, somebody made a leap.
[02:42:58.352 --> 02:43:01.474]  I'm not... I have no plans to go to Oklahoma at this point, so...
[02:43:02.653 --> 02:43:06.335]  Well, you made it sound like you were going to try and find out more what he was doing in college out there.
[02:43:06.415 --> 02:43:11.257]  You'd be surprised that you can learn with a telephone and a good directory, so... Yes.
[02:43:11.657 --> 02:43:14.058]  We're going to start that way first, and we'll see.
[02:43:14.078 --> 02:43:14.438]  Okay, okay.
[02:43:14.458 --> 02:43:15.299]  Go ahead, John.
[02:43:15.379 --> 02:43:23.082]  In your statements about half an hour ago, you referred to some Russian immigrants, and you were very reluctant to mention a religious sect, and I'm wondering, are these Orthodox Jews?
[02:43:23.102 --> 02:43:24.083]  Well, I don't know for a fact.
[02:43:24.303 --> 02:43:26.604]  I mean, some of them, I believe, according to the clip...
[02:43:27.677 --> 02:43:28.298]  Question number two.
[02:43:28.338 --> 02:43:30.880]  What does Mr. Berg, the father, do for a living?
[02:43:30.920 --> 02:43:36.385]  I understand he and his son seem to have been, like, so, you know, active in this, you know, tower building, whatever, microwave.
[02:43:36.405 --> 02:43:36.605]  Right.
[02:43:36.625 --> 02:43:37.245]  Well, I mean, it's weird.
[02:43:37.305 --> 02:43:37.486]  I mean...
[02:43:49.856 --> 02:43:58.745]  I mean, Michael Berg, the father for a long time, was a school teacher in the same district in Westchester, Pennsylvania, where Nick Berg went to school.
[02:43:59.085 --> 02:44:00.526]  Now, he retired a few years ago.
[02:44:00.546 --> 02:44:01.767]  I guess he took an early retirement.
[02:44:02.108 --> 02:44:02.368]  Right.
[02:44:02.648 --> 02:44:09.715]  And he has been... It is a fact that he was involved with his son's business.
[02:44:11.376 --> 02:44:12.357]  He represented himself...
[02:44:13.371 --> 02:44:19.054]  On several occasions, like the office manager... It's funny, they didn't seem to have any equipment that I know of and things like that.
[02:44:19.094 --> 02:44:21.095]  Maybe they subcontracted who knows, but one more item.
[02:44:21.275 --> 02:44:21.796]  Okay, please.
[02:44:22.536 --> 02:44:29.160]  CNN has about, you know, two weeks ago done a lot of, you know, talking to people over there in Iraq.
[02:44:29.860 --> 02:44:34.742]  One of them was named Andrew Duke, who allegedly is a friend of Mr. Burns.
[02:44:35.082 --> 02:44:38.944]  Yes, I'm interested in knowing more about this Andrew Duke.
[02:44:38.964 --> 02:44:42.706]  This man seems to be talking as though he was intimately involved with him.
[02:44:42.826 --> 02:44:45.747]  Mr. Duke looks to be of Semitic origins.
[02:44:45.867 --> 02:44:47.828]  He looks like Yasser Arafat's twin.
[02:44:48.348 --> 02:44:50.269]  Full beard, okay, unshaven, you know.
[02:44:50.729 --> 02:44:53.410]  And, I mean, you know, who knows who he really works for.
[02:44:53.890 --> 02:44:56.391]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[02:44:57.371 --> 02:44:58.151]  I appreciate it.
[02:44:58.671 --> 02:45:08.195]  I mean, obviously you've got this Russian mafia people and all this going back and forth and the dads involved in the business and weird stuff with hijackers.
[02:45:08.275 --> 02:45:09.015]  I mean, folks.
[02:45:10.207 --> 02:45:11.128]  This is unbelievable.
[02:45:11.808 --> 02:45:16.750]  But again, the question is, if it is intelligence, is it CIA, is it Mossad?
[02:45:17.230 --> 02:45:21.692]  I guess we've got to have reporters like William Bunch try to find out what's going on here.
[02:45:21.712 --> 02:45:27.394]  I know we've got a stench coming from below the floorboards, but is it a possum or is it a human body?
[02:45:28.635 --> 02:45:29.795]  Do you see where I'm going with that?
[02:45:30.836 --> 02:45:31.716]  I see where you're going.
[02:45:31.776 --> 02:45:34.797]  As far as I'm concerned, I'm just going to try and see where the facts go.
[02:45:35.077 --> 02:45:38.179]  It all starts from there.
[02:45:38.479 --> 02:45:38.579]  And
[02:45:39.400 --> 02:45:44.143]  So far there's been a lot more speculation than fact, and I don't even think we know half the truth yet.
[02:45:44.643 --> 02:45:45.084]  I hear you.
[02:45:45.204 --> 02:45:47.085]  So stay tuned, everybody.
[02:45:47.325 --> 02:45:50.087]  We'll see what else is coming out.
[02:45:50.787 --> 02:45:54.610]  All right, Joanne in Maryland, last caller for our guest.
[02:45:54.890 --> 02:45:55.770]  Joanne, go ahead.
[02:45:56.151 --> 02:45:57.772]  Yes, thank you for taking my call.
[02:45:58.192 --> 02:46:00.313]  I have a statement, actually.
[02:46:00.493 --> 02:46:02.935]  I was watching our local news.
[02:46:03.325 --> 02:46:04.265]  We're good to go.
[02:46:04.465 --> 02:46:05.086]  We're good to go.
[02:46:32.898 --> 02:46:33.818]  That's all I wanted to say.
[02:46:33.858 --> 02:46:37.580]  I just wanted to, you know, tell him that he was on the Eastern Shore sometime or another.
[02:46:38.260 --> 02:46:39.441]  Yeah, well, thanks for that information.
[02:46:39.501 --> 02:46:53.666]  I mean, clearly, you know, Crowley Knicksburg had some expertise in the communications power business, and he did work for, you know, all the evidence I've seen is he worked for a number of, you know, bona fide radio stations around the East Coast.
[02:46:53.806 --> 02:46:55.787]  They said very highly of him anyway.
[02:46:56.787 --> 02:46:57.308]  Thank you.
[02:46:57.568 --> 02:46:58.889]  Yes, that was the point I was trying to make earlier.
[02:46:58.909 --> 02:47:05.494]  I mean, people who knew Nick Berg all speak highly of him, and that makes the loss even more tragic.
[02:47:06.915 --> 02:47:08.696]  Well, it's all very suspicious.
[02:47:08.816 --> 02:47:13.540]  The facts we do have are very suspicious, but we do need to get more facts before we go to conclusions.
[02:47:13.640 --> 02:47:24.628]  But I really appreciate you joining us, Mr. Bunch, from the Philadelphia Daily News, your busy schedule, and we can continue to watch your columns, your reports there at philly.com.
[02:47:25.991 --> 02:47:30.195]  And we really appreciate you coming on, and please contact us if there's a new development.
[02:47:31.156 --> 02:47:31.616]  Absolutely.
[02:47:31.656 --> 02:47:32.677]  I'll send it along to you guys.
[02:47:33.198 --> 02:47:36.260]  I've got your email now, and it should be no problem.
[02:47:36.681 --> 02:47:38.722]  And I hope there is more that comes out.
[02:47:38.802 --> 02:47:40.564]  I think I'm pretty sure there will be.
[02:47:40.644 --> 02:47:42.506]  And in the meantime, thanks for having me on the show.
[02:47:43.066 --> 02:47:45.649]  Well, so your editor is letting you work more on this story?
[02:47:46.649 --> 02:47:47.510]  Absolutely.
[02:47:47.750 --> 02:47:48.311]  Absolutely.
[02:47:48.531 --> 02:47:49.992]  So we'll see what develops.
[02:47:50.213 --> 02:47:50.533]  Okay.
[02:47:50.553 --> 02:47:51.434]  Thanks a lot for coming on.
[02:47:51.474 --> 02:47:52.014]  Take care, William.
[02:47:52.034 --> 02:47:52.314]  All right.
[02:47:52.334 --> 02:47:52.615]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:47:52.635 --> 02:47:52.815]  Bye-bye.
[02:47:53.530 --> 02:47:56.871]  All right, well, that was just four incredible guests today.
[02:47:56.911 --> 02:48:20.460]  In the first hour, co-founder of the 9-11 Citizens Watch and contributor to Unanswered Questions, and Hens was president at the 11th public hearing of the 9-11 Whitewash Commission, with testimony by former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, where Giuliani was confronted by activists, and we had the activist, an investigative journalist on, Christopher Broder, and he did a great job there.
[02:48:22.057 --> 02:48:29.530]  And then we also, former Staff Sergeant Jimmy Massey has come out and told the world, I killed innocent people for our government.
[02:48:29.550 --> 02:48:30.571]  That was in the second hour.
[02:48:30.591 --> 02:48:34.678]  In the third hour, William Bunch of the Philadelphia Daily News, you just heard that.
[02:48:35.621 --> 02:48:40.703]  And we're going to re-air this interview tonight from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:48:40.823 --> 02:48:41.584]  All these interviews.
[02:48:41.624 --> 02:48:45.145]  So please tell your friends, your neighbors, your family, your email list.
[02:48:45.305 --> 02:48:46.506]  Great broadcast today.
[02:48:46.566 --> 02:48:47.366]  Really informative.
[02:48:47.406 --> 02:48:50.207]  A whole education wrapped into this show today.
[02:48:50.948 --> 02:48:52.228]  All the glory goes to God.
[02:48:52.808 --> 02:48:58.651]  Please tell folks about InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv where they can listen to it tonight when it re-airs.
[02:48:58.671 --> 02:49:00.172]  We'll also repost these at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:49:25.398 --> 02:49:29.461]  We've still got a final segment coming up here.
[02:49:30.311 --> 02:49:32.575]  I just really want to give the callers a response.
[02:49:33.537 --> 02:49:38.064]  I mean, to give the callers a chance to respond because I get their response, I should say.
[02:49:39.226 --> 02:49:41.711]  To all of this that we've discussed, we'll give each caller...
[02:49:42.823 --> 02:49:50.728]  About 45 seconds coming up here in the final five-minute segment, so we should be able to jam in about five or six callers.

[02:51:35.613 --> 02:51:41.580]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:45.043 --> 02:51:49.388]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:51:49.568 --> 02:51:54.293]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:51:56.271 --> 02:51:58.534]  Use this disaster as a new world order.
[02:51:58.634 --> 02:52:01.317]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:52:01.677 --> 02:52:05.902]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:52:05.982 --> 02:52:12.910]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act Legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:52:13.030 --> 02:52:15.033]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:52:15.433 --> 02:52:25.778]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:52:26.018 --> 02:52:31.401]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:52:31.901 --> 02:52:34.562]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:52:34.662 --> 02:52:35.683]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:52:35.723 --> 02:52:35.963]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:52:36.043 --> 02:52:37.564]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:52:45.091 --> 02:52:48.075]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:52:48.436 --> 02:52:57.288]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:52:57.588 --> 02:53:02.275]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:53:02.735 --> 02:53:09.458]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:53:09.858 --> 02:53:21.643]  It also removes foul-tasted odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:53:22.103 --> 02:53:26.568]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:53:26.748 --> 02:53:29.071]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:53:29.091 --> 02:53:31.053]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:53:51.745 --> 02:53:58.832]  Didn't have a lot of time to take calls today with four guests, but here at the end we've even got some lines up in a rarity at 800-259-9231.
[02:53:58.852 --> 02:54:03.516]  If you want to call in with a final comment.
[02:54:03.857 --> 02:54:05.578]  Brad in Colorado, then Gary in others.
[02:54:05.658 --> 02:54:06.399]  Brad, go ahead.
[02:54:07.100 --> 02:54:09.382]  Alex, what a perfect show today.
[02:54:09.482 --> 02:54:10.243]  This was classic.
[02:54:10.919 --> 02:54:17.602]  There is so much information on that, I am so glad that I recorded it, and I can go back and just digest it piece by piece.
[02:54:17.862 --> 02:54:20.743]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:54:21.103 --> 02:54:23.964]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:54:24.204 --> 02:54:28.586]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination?
[02:54:28.606 --> 02:54:32.828]  ...to you for, oh, three or four years, and I've been recording at least about the last year of it.
[02:54:34.591 --> 02:54:51.597]  Did you get my email that I sent to tips at infowar.com about the high school teacher in Albuquerque who was basically harassed out of a contract because his poetry class had people in it that were criticizing the great leader?
[02:54:52.578 --> 02:54:54.399]  No, but I see reports like that every day.
[02:54:54.539 --> 02:54:55.239]  When did you send it?
[02:54:55.639 --> 02:54:56.620]  I sent it last night.
[02:54:57.080 --> 02:55:00.701]  Okay, frankly, I could only spend like 30 minutes this morning on email.
[02:55:00.801 --> 02:55:02.242]  My wife obviously did see it.
[02:55:02.662 --> 02:55:03.642]  I'll try to post that.
[02:55:03.722 --> 02:55:06.023]  Because that would be another great guest.
[02:55:06.243 --> 02:55:10.905]  Because another thing, in a high school, with a military liaison...
[02:55:11.625 --> 02:55:13.046]  Oh, now, we've had that for two years.
[02:55:13.086 --> 02:55:15.608]  They're in there to recruit, and they get everybody ready.
[02:55:15.788 --> 02:55:18.070]  Well, this was not recruiting.
[02:55:18.510 --> 02:55:26.816]  It was because the principal and the military liaison were part of where the student was chastised.
[02:55:27.157 --> 02:55:28.838]  The teacher was...
[02:55:31.106 --> 02:55:33.589]  And yes, they have these political officers at UT.
[02:55:33.629 --> 02:55:36.451]  They have troops running around in plain clothes harassing people.
[02:55:36.711 --> 02:55:38.353]  Wall Street Journal, thanks for the call.
[02:55:38.853 --> 02:55:41.075]  Man, I tell you, this is a scary pattern, folks.
[02:55:41.856 --> 02:55:43.477]  Gary in Arizona.
[02:55:43.537 --> 02:55:44.418]  Gary, you're on the air.
[02:55:44.458 --> 02:55:44.898]  Go ahead.
[02:55:45.459 --> 02:55:46.560]  Hey, Alex.
[02:55:46.620 --> 02:55:48.161]  It's Barry in Arizona.
[02:55:48.281 --> 02:55:48.862]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:55:49.727 --> 02:55:52.890]  Yeah, I know you're not Dr. Ward, but help me out here a little bit.
[02:55:52.910 --> 02:55:54.131]  I'm getting a little depressed, man.
[02:55:54.151 --> 02:56:02.017]  I'm trying to have meetings and everything, get people together, because every time I turn the news on, it's martial law, mass detention, so we're going to have to do this and that.
[02:56:02.557 --> 02:56:05.720]  Yeah, they're conditioning us for the next attack, so we'll accept it.
[02:56:05.860 --> 02:56:07.221]  But the people aren't buying it, buddy.
[02:56:08.021 --> 02:56:09.202]  Well, good.
[02:56:09.422 --> 02:56:09.903]  I'm glad.
[02:56:10.043 --> 02:56:16.528]  I mean, people in my community are just kind of still in denial, but some people are kind of starting to wake up a little bit.
[02:56:16.688 --> 02:56:22.332]  A lot of people who are in denial heard what you had to say, heard what I had to say, heard what countless others had to say.
[02:56:22.352 --> 02:56:24.034]  They're not going to listen until it gets bad for them.
[02:56:24.314 --> 02:56:27.316]  But at that key point, that seed you planted will sprout.
[02:56:28.037 --> 02:56:30.459]  Well, Alex, I just got a really important question here for you.
[02:56:30.499 --> 02:56:31.760]  I mean, I'm interested...
[02:56:32.421 --> 02:56:37.965]  In defense of myself and my community, and it looks like they're pushing us toward this physical confrontation.
[02:56:38.386 --> 02:56:40.367]  I don't want that to happen, but what do I do?
[02:56:42.029 --> 02:56:43.730]  Sir, the pen is the monitor and the sword.
[02:56:43.790 --> 02:56:49.054]  You keep getting the word out, keep waking people up, and then you defend yourself and your family physically if need be against tyranny.
[02:56:49.734 --> 02:56:51.476]  Yeah, well, that's what I'm working on doing.
[02:56:51.516 --> 02:56:56.900]  I'm showing your videos, I'm organizing groups, and trying to get things together at the local library.
[02:56:57.400 --> 02:56:58.801]  But I really appreciate all you do, and...
[02:57:00.083 --> 02:57:02.504]  Keep up the good work, and I'll keep working at it.
[02:57:02.584 --> 02:57:03.985]  And thanks for your support.
[02:57:04.345 --> 02:57:05.086]  Thank you, my friend.
[02:57:05.106 --> 02:57:06.026]  Thanks for your support.
[02:57:06.066 --> 02:57:09.408]  Look, we've got to break past the left-right debate.
[02:57:09.468 --> 02:57:13.050]  We've got to get down to the real nuts and bolts of this, and that's the New World Order.
[02:57:14.071 --> 02:57:15.892]  And you heard the military officer earlier.
[02:57:16.212 --> 02:57:18.714]  He found out we're meant to look bad.
[02:57:18.754 --> 02:57:19.654]  We're meant to abuse.
[02:57:19.694 --> 02:57:20.695]  We're meant to be evil.
[02:57:20.995 --> 02:57:22.576]  And then the UN comes in as the savior.
[02:57:23.136 --> 02:57:24.717]  So the left needs to figure that out.
[02:57:24.797 --> 02:57:28.159]  Michael Moore needs to figure that out, that the UN isn't going to save us.
[02:57:28.780 --> 02:57:29.920]  I mean, they think absolutely nothing of you.
[02:57:59.452 --> 02:58:02.053]  And we're all going to be judged one day before our Creator.
[02:58:02.933 --> 02:58:06.975]  And we're going to be judged on this plane of existence by the evil we all engage in.
[02:58:06.995 --> 02:58:08.276]  That all comes back to haunt us.
[02:58:08.936 --> 02:58:14.758]  When you don't care about your community, when you aren't informed, when you aren't involved fighting corruption, it grows and grows and grows.
[02:58:15.118 --> 02:58:17.259]  And it destroys our way of life and our freedom.
[02:58:17.799 --> 02:58:19.880]  We're going into hell on earth right now.
[02:58:20.721 --> 02:58:24.202]  Because so many of us have just let the government have control.
[02:58:24.522 --> 02:58:25.983]  Oh, they won't do any bad.
[02:58:26.023 --> 02:58:26.763]  Let's go to sleep.
[02:58:27.466 --> 02:58:29.128]  History shows that's a total fraud.
[02:58:29.748 --> 02:58:30.929]  So stop being complacent.
[02:58:31.169 --> 02:58:32.851]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight, back on Monday.
[02:58:36.505 --> 02:58:45.110]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:58:45.331 --> 02:58:56.617]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:58:56.838 --> 02:58:59.479]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:58:59.819 --> 02:59:03.922]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[02:59:04.122 --> 02:59:06.265]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:59:06.425 --> 02:59:08.307]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:59:08.508 --> 02:59:14.535]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[02:59:14.796 --> 02:59:20.443]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:59:20.783 --> 02:59:24.707]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:59:24.727 --> 02:59:25.427]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
