[00:00:05.424 --> 00:00:06.065]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.726 --> 00:00:07.767]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:09.610]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.251 --> 00:00:11.072]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:12.735]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.755 --> 00:00:17.061]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.582 --> 00:00:21.627]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:36.530]  Well, well, well, it is already Monday, the second day of August 2004.
[00:00:37.031 --> 00:00:41.132]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:41.192 --> 00:00:42.933]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:44.114 --> 00:00:50.196]  The websites are infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, and prisonplanet.tv.
[00:00:55.086 --> 00:01:11.536]  Obviously, we're going to be talking about Governor Ridge yesterday coming out in a press conference saying we have specific, credible threats of financial corporate institutions that are going to be attacked.
[00:01:11.576 --> 00:01:14.438]  And we heard rumblings of this on Friday's broadcast.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.844]  And now they're claiming that they grabbed some unnamed al-Qaeda operative in Afghanistan, and that's why they have all of this.
[00:01:25.031 --> 00:01:28.654]  Now remember, they flew 8,000 Taliban and Al-Qaeda leaders out.
[00:01:28.774 --> 00:01:30.216]  Al-Qaeda is CIA.
[00:01:30.676 --> 00:01:37.662]  Al-Qaeda was used to attack the Serbs as late as 1998 as the pretext for that war.
[00:01:39.924 --> 00:01:42.086]  That's the Republican's own Senate report.
[00:01:43.147 --> 00:01:47.391]  So if people know the basics, you understand what a fraud all of this is.
[00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.453]  But then I started thinking, you know, when they do these stock market threats, it drives down stocks.
[00:01:56.733 --> 00:02:05.477]  And wouldn't it be interesting to go look and see if there's been large put options put against certain industries?
[00:02:05.537 --> 00:02:10.820]  Because then they would know, because they were going to make the announcement, that the stock market would go down.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.803]  You know, saying that the New York Stock Exchange is a big target and other...
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.161]  Mercantile Enterprises.
[00:02:22.922 --> 00:02:27.444]  And remember, this is the same government that did put options against America and United.
[00:02:27.464 --> 00:02:36.788]  The same government that put out the betting scheme, DARPA's Running Man Betting website, to bet on dead U.S.
[00:02:36.868 --> 00:02:37.488]  soldiers.
[00:02:37.988 --> 00:02:38.588]  Remember that?
[00:02:38.628 --> 00:02:41.170]  We're going to go back over that today.
[00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.451]  New York's Holland Tunnel is closing.
[00:02:45.511 --> 00:02:48.873]  The Holland Tunnel was to close commercial traffic
[00:02:50.438 --> 00:03:06.164]  Heading to New York, officials said, they're the officials, the ban was correlated to the warning about downtown financial districts, said Tony Silovia, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
[00:03:09.145 --> 00:03:10.166]  What do you think about this?
[00:03:11.098 --> 00:03:24.451]  I mean, it not only creates a chilling effect for the election, makes Bush's approval ratings go up, scares us into accepting the big announcement this morning by Bush of a giant new domestic CIA.
[00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:27.835]  We got the CIA in 1947 along with the National Security Act.
[00:03:34.062 --> 00:03:41.006]  And now we're going to have a super mega agency over Homeland Security, over FEMA, over your local police department.
[00:03:42.227 --> 00:03:43.528]  All crime is terrorism.
[00:03:44.168 --> 00:03:51.793]  I have stacks of articles where they're putting up cameras all over the country saying it's to fight terror and crime, and Homeland Security is paying for it.
[00:03:56.096 --> 00:03:59.318]  This is so transparent.
[00:03:59.358 --> 00:04:02.140]  This whole thing is just so obvious.
[00:04:03.703 --> 00:04:05.525]  They're getting rid of Posse Comitatus.
[00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:07.066]  They're militarizing the police.
[00:04:07.126 --> 00:04:08.988]  They're telling us torture's good.
[00:04:09.028 --> 00:04:10.869]  They're building prisons all over the place.
[00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.992]  They're telling us we're going to have a domestic CIA.
[00:04:14.472 --> 00:04:17.035]  But even if we have this, we're still going to have bigger attacks.
[00:04:17.095 --> 00:04:18.035]  Just get used to it.
[00:04:18.496 --> 00:04:20.918]  You're going to have to give up your freedoms to defend liberty.
[00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:26.823]  Why, the terrorists are going to attack to get our liberty, so we've got to get rid of our liberty as fast as possible.
[00:04:28.806 --> 00:04:32.727]  We've got to disrupt the elections because the terrorists want to disrupt the elections.
[00:04:32.867 --> 00:04:35.228]  And then again, that's just one layer of the onion.
[00:04:36.888 --> 00:04:45.391]  We've also got the fact that this is a farce election between John Forbes Carey and George Walker Bush.
[00:04:46.011 --> 00:04:48.272]  Cousins, skull and bones members.
[00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:52.433]  This is a Manchurian global election, my friends.
[00:04:53.453 --> 00:04:56.814]  We'll come back, get into all the details, take your calls and a lot more.
[00:04:56.834 --> 00:04:58.215]  So stay with us.
[00:05:00.922 --> 00:05:05.265]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.446 --> 00:05:09.869]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:14.393]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:05:14.433 --> 00:05:15.774]  The New World Order.
[00:05:17.575 --> 00:05:21.799]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:21.859 --> 00:05:28.785]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:28.925 --> 00:05:30.927]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.314 --> 00:05:41.617]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:41.917 --> 00:05:47.279]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:05:47.799 --> 00:05:50.420]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.300]  Your call is toll-free, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.800]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:52.841]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:00.552 --> 00:06:11.302]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:06:11.462 --> 00:06:19.069]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:19.269 --> 00:06:28.497]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable level, and it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:06:28.737 --> 00:06:34.883]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:39.140]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.101]  The water level is always visible.
[00:06:41.261 --> 00:06:47.182]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:06:47.442 --> 00:06:51.143]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:07:00.487 --> 00:07:01.188]  Don't let them have it.
[00:07:01.208 --> 00:07:04.270]  The Asset Protection Team can show you how to protect yourself from anybody that wants to sue you.
[00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.851]  Simple, fast, affordable, and bulletproof.
[00:07:22.864 --> 00:07:24.805]  Let the Asset Protection Team show you how.

[00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:34.732]  Or visit AssetProtectionTeam.com.
[00:07:34.932 --> 00:07:35.473]  Don't wait.
[00:07:35.633 --> 00:07:44.039]  Plan your strategy today before you encounter a lawsuit, bankruptcy, accident, judgment, lien, probate, creditor, medical crisis, malpractice, or worse.
[00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:48.742]  Plan today before you are confronted with a false claim, divorce, audit, state agency...
[00:07:49.062 --> 00:07:52.484]  Federal agency, restraining order, an angry ex-partner, or worse.
[00:07:52.664 --> 00:07:55.205]  Visit AssetProtectionTeam.com or call 888-240-3337.
[00:08:17.083 --> 00:08:31.112]  Did you hear about the New York City policeman who found a homeless person sleeping in a parking garage and refused to arrest him, just kicked him out of the facility?
[00:08:33.173 --> 00:08:37.696]  Well, they're moving to fire him and are charging him with some stuff.
[00:08:37.736 --> 00:08:40.417]  We've got his lawyer coming on in the next hour.
[00:08:42.699 --> 00:08:44.240]  And then, of course, there was that article...
[00:08:45.189 --> 00:08:48.971]  From Friday, woman arrested for chewing in D.C.
[00:08:49.032 --> 00:08:49.892]  Metro Station.
[00:08:50.392 --> 00:08:52.113]  That was out of the Associated Press.
[00:08:53.554 --> 00:09:03.521]  And they admitted that this was in D.C., getting on the subway system.
[00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:07.363]  She was about to walk through the turnstiles and
[00:09:09.992 --> 00:09:14.915]  She had part of a candy bar left, a payday, and the officer said, you cannot eat that.
[00:09:14.935 --> 00:09:18.977]  And she said, I know, and stuck the last bite in her mouth and began chewing.
[00:09:19.018 --> 00:09:23.580]  He thought, and they actually talked to the cop here, that that was disrespectful, so they arrested her.
[00:09:26.022 --> 00:09:27.303]  So this is the new freedom.
[00:09:28.743 --> 00:09:36.368]  But thousands of Muslims sneaking across the southern border and the northern border, they hold them, and then they're ordered to release them.
[00:09:38.086 --> 00:09:40.528]  And I'm not even saying these Muslims are terrorists, folks.
[00:09:40.568 --> 00:09:55.722]  But the point is that they're telling us as citizens, regardless of what color we are, that we've got to have wireless video cameras with microphones mounted in our neighborhoods, not just on our city streets, watching our every move.
[00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:56.642]  I mean, it's a joke.
[00:09:58.904 --> 00:10:05.110]  We're going to have to have a domestic, giant, new CIA body domestically
[00:10:06.426 --> 00:10:07.506]  Running our lives.
[00:10:07.526 --> 00:10:15.068]  I mean, this is a huge announcement by Bush, and they're going, my gosh, bipartisan by the Congress, and bipartisan by the Commission.
[00:10:15.128 --> 00:10:17.429]  This is moving ahead, and Gary supports it.
[00:10:18.069 --> 00:10:24.390]  A huge domestic intelligence agency watching all of us, and the families demand it.
[00:10:26.531 --> 00:10:34.313]  Actually, the families are all saying on websites and through their lawyers and on C-SPAN that they think it's all a big cover-up, and that the government created...
[00:10:35.231 --> 00:10:36.212]  We're good to go.
[00:10:36.232 --> 00:10:36.452]  I think?
[00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:04.911]  We're not going to have an orange alert nationwide, though.
[00:11:04.931 --> 00:11:07.353]  They want to save that for later, or a red alert, even worse.
[00:11:07.813 --> 00:11:10.435]  No, we're just going to have elevated levels in certain cities.
[00:11:14.198 --> 00:11:16.319]  And so Ridge went out and talked about this.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:24.786]  But then, at the same time, Bush comes out this morning, just about 30 minutes ago, and says, look...
[00:11:26.715 --> 00:11:28.236]  You know, this is what the people demand.
[00:11:28.277 --> 00:11:29.157]  You're going to have it.
[00:11:29.177 --> 00:11:29.578]  Don't worry.
[00:11:29.598 --> 00:11:30.559]  We'll keep you safe.
[00:11:30.579 --> 00:11:34.322]  We're going to give you this new giant domestic intelligence agency.
[00:11:35.163 --> 00:11:42.130]  Then he went on to speak about why they're putting out these terror alerts so they can be transparent for us.
[00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:44.232]  I mean, that's the total opposite of what they're really doing.
[00:11:45.613 --> 00:11:47.055]  What do you think's behind all this?
[00:11:49.343 --> 00:12:02.929]  You know, I want to take 30 minutes out sometime in the broadcast today to read this lengthy 16-page article, at least part of it, by Professor Michelle Tosadoski, coup d'etat in America.
[00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:17.735]  And in 16 pages, he lays out just the complete evidence that we've put out here, kind of in a scattershot diatribe over the years, of how they're really publicly setting up a New World Order takeover of America.
[00:12:21.194 --> 00:12:49.174]  Also, I was listening to the Derry Brownfield radio show this morning here on this network, on the Genesis Network, and he was reading the mainstream news reports of how a giant bank, foreign bank from the Netherlands, is going to take over the federal banking system over four Midwestern states.
[00:12:50.316 --> 00:12:59.783]  And it's going to basically call in many of the loans on the tens of thousands of farmers and ranchers in those states.
[00:12:59.863 --> 00:13:05.387]  I mean, it's the total looting, and that's what privatization is.
[00:13:05.447 --> 00:13:09.310]  Privatization isn't saying we're actually going to privatize a business.
[00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:19.598]  It just means we're going to hand over government institutions that we've all paid for and public infrastructure to the private individuals and companies
[00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:23.700]  That have bought and paid for our politicians.
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:29.001]  They put the politicians in, and the politician gives them the keys to the city and says it's privatization.
[00:13:29.561 --> 00:13:43.924]  It's like Russia's reform in the 1990s was six oligarchs taking over the entire economy and setting up the same old secret police systems, the disappearing in the night, the work camps.
[00:13:43.964 --> 00:13:45.304]  They've still got all that in Russia.
[00:13:45.344 --> 00:13:45.844]  It's admitted.
[00:13:47.051 --> 00:13:53.617]  But, oh, it's free market now because we have six thugs running the communist apparatus.
[00:13:54.758 --> 00:13:58.761]  Well, funny, before you just had one thug doing it and all of their minions.
[00:13:58.801 --> 00:14:00.082]  So it's the exact same thing.
[00:14:00.463 --> 00:14:04.506]  But the left and right population out there can't get their brains around this.
[00:14:05.828 --> 00:14:06.688]  It's like China.
[00:14:06.768 --> 00:14:12.994]  China's supposedly communistic, and you've got just a few dozen families owning and running the whole place.
[00:14:14.366 --> 00:14:36.018]  And at the 50th anniversary of the Communist Revolution there a few years ago, they had CEOs there for the Fortune 500 meeting in Tiananmen Square for a military parade, and Jiang Zemin stood up and said, this was the BBC headline, he said capitalism is the greatest form of communism.
[00:14:40.962 --> 00:14:41.943]  And people said, what?
[00:14:42.083 --> 00:14:43.203]  Is he going crazy?
[00:14:43.764 --> 00:14:45.344]  Well, no, David Rockefeller.
[00:14:46.505 --> 00:14:48.666]  And the quote, by the way, is in the front of my book.
[00:14:49.327 --> 00:14:55.010]  I've got 30 or 40 quotes at the beginning of my book, 9-11, Descent into Tyranny.
[00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:08.637]  And that's the date where back when Mao Zedong died in the 70s, I think it was 76, it's a New York Times quote, he said, oh man, Mao is just great, and look at the wonderful system they built, and he was just a wondrous person, and we love him, and
[00:15:12.535 --> 00:15:18.418]  Again, there is no capitalism, there is no communism, there is no socialism, there is no fascism.
[00:15:18.898 --> 00:15:21.679]  There is only command and control.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:37.647]  And then under those different terms I just mentioned, those different isms, it's just the paint job on the vehicle, or the window dressing, or the crockery that you're eating the meal out of.
[00:15:38.953 --> 00:15:41.335]  What's being put on the plates is the same thing.
[00:15:41.715 --> 00:15:50.482]  Black ski masks, secret police, arrest, no freedom, centralization, fat cats running everything, running the government, running industry.
[00:15:55.305 --> 00:16:00.749]  And then, remember about a month ago, new freedom.
[00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:02.891]  I always joke and go,
[00:16:03.766 --> 00:16:07.567]  The SWAT team busted in the wrong house and shot the old lady twice in the chest.
[00:16:07.607 --> 00:16:08.547]  No one's been charged.
[00:16:09.208 --> 00:16:10.148]  This is the new freedom.
[00:16:13.729 --> 00:16:19.751]  The Defense Department has issued ground penetrating radar that looks right through your walls and is mounting it on police helicopters.
[00:16:19.791 --> 00:16:20.871]  It's part of the new freedom.
[00:16:22.332 --> 00:16:26.213]  Well, the President has a new commission called the New Freedom Commission.
[00:16:27.713 --> 00:16:29.974]  They had a program here in Texas since the early 90s
[00:16:32.208 --> 00:16:37.449]  And it is to test every school child, every one.
[00:16:37.489 --> 00:16:40.090]  They said then it will be adults as well for mental illness.
[00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:43.211]  And then to try to put them on antipsychotics.
[00:16:43.471 --> 00:16:45.572]  They said 15% of us need to be on these immediately.
[00:16:47.892 --> 00:16:48.933]  And it's called New Freedom.
[00:16:49.893 --> 00:17:01.316]  Well, here's an article out of Illinois, and it says, Children's Mental Health Task Force hearings continue through Friday.
[00:17:03.157 --> 00:17:04.978]  This was going on last week in Illinois.
[00:17:04.998 --> 00:17:23.492]  And it says, As public forums continue this week throughout the state, more concerns emerge as parents learn of a new mental health screening plan for Illinois children ages 0 to 18 and pregnant women.
[00:17:23.992 --> 00:17:24.573]  That's right.
[00:17:26.334 --> 00:17:28.916]  All of you, I forgot to mention that in the federal plan,
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:30.801]  We're good to go.
[00:17:56.078 --> 00:18:11.948]  Children's Mental Health, an urgent priority for Illinois, is the 53-page report in which the Children's Mental Health Act of 2003 is based upon details of a vast new bureaucracy which stresses intervention and treatment for all Illinois children from the womb and continues through adolescence at age 18.
[00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:16.351]  And they go into this.
[00:18:17.212 --> 00:18:18.993]  This is out of the Illinois Leader.
[00:18:19.973 --> 00:18:22.295]  This is a major piece of legislation, Mike Burke.
[00:18:25.382 --> 00:18:30.745]  We know the behavior is shape in the early years.
[00:18:30.765 --> 00:18:35.467]  It's shape in the early years, and the emotional well-being is affected by complications with birth.
[00:18:35.887 --> 00:18:37.128]  Oh, at birth, got to drug them.
[00:18:37.608 --> 00:18:41.790]  This act forces Illinois to recognize the importance of children's emotional well-being.
[00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:46.112]  It's all the horrible things the government does, but it's for the children.
[00:18:47.813 --> 00:18:52.675]  When they said they were going to try to shut down local Austin Access TV last week, it was, it's for the children.
[00:18:54.409 --> 00:18:55.670]  Everything's for the children.
[00:18:58.151 --> 00:18:59.651]  And so it goes on and on.
[00:19:00.111 --> 00:19:05.154]  Screening, testing, and treatments are to be offered in homes, preschools, daycare, and throughout the public school system.
[00:19:05.574 --> 00:19:12.016]  A child over the age of 12 will be provided two mental health sessions without parental consent.
[00:19:14.577 --> 00:19:18.479]  The act creates the child's mental health partnership that reports directly to the governor.
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.901]  And again, it requires the testing of all children and all
[00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:31.054]  All women at hospitals, they already do this at most hospitals, spy on you, ask you a hundred questions as your wife's having the baby.
[00:19:34.796 --> 00:19:36.117]  They want to get you in the system.
[00:19:36.137 --> 00:19:41.840]  If they can't get you on welfare, if they can't get you in the criminal justice system, they're going to get you in the psychiatric system.
[00:19:45.322 --> 00:19:49.624]  And of course, when they bankrupt this economy, you'll go into the creditor's prison system.
[00:19:51.229 --> 00:19:54.192]  We'll get into the new terror alerts and your calls.
[00:19:55.354 --> 00:19:58.437]  prisonplanet.tv and infowars.com are the websites.
[00:19:58.477 --> 00:19:58.878]  Stay with us.
[00:20:00.672 --> 00:20:01.653]  It's finally here.
[00:20:01.793 --> 00:20:02.793]  Spring has arrived.
[00:20:02.974 --> 00:20:05.936]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:20:06.156 --> 00:20:09.618]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:20:09.818 --> 00:20:17.984]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can too with the help of the ARC Institute's brand new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:20:18.224 --> 00:20:21.966]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[00:20:22.187 --> 00:20:22.547]  It's fun.
[00:20:22.967 --> 00:20:23.827]  We're good to go.
[00:20:43.752 --> 00:20:49.235]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[00:20:49.415 --> 00:20:53.157]  Call the Ark Institute toll-free at 800-255-1912.

[00:21:00.642 --> 00:21:03.143]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:03.823 --> 00:21:07.445]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[00:21:08.106 --> 00:21:11.888]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[00:21:12.659 --> 00:21:21.242]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[00:21:22.202 --> 00:21:29.404]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.
[00:21:30.324 --> 00:21:38.387]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch magazine.

[00:22:01.502 --> 00:22:02.523]  The war on terrorism.
[00:22:02.863 --> 00:22:05.645]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:22:05.905 --> 00:22:10.067]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:22:10.488 --> 00:22:11.328]  So what do you do?
[00:22:11.648 --> 00:22:16.271]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:22:16.712 --> 00:22:18.853]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:22:19.333 --> 00:22:29.900]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health
[00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:30.570]  That's 888-803-4438.

[00:23:25.555 --> 00:23:28.498]  And remember, if you read the Midas Report, you'll receive a free Walking Liberty Silver Half Dollar.
[00:24:14.612 --> 00:24:18.375]  Coming up in the next hour, we'll just spend 15 minutes on this or so.
[00:24:19.896 --> 00:24:22.818]  We've got the high-powered lawyer, Norman Siegel.
[00:24:22.838 --> 00:24:24.660]  Heard that name before.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.143]  Coming on, he's defending this New York police officer who's got a great record, by the way.
[00:24:30.357 --> 00:24:39.482]  Who refused to arrest an old homeless man who was asleep on the bottom floor of a parking garage in a corner.
[00:24:42.043 --> 00:24:43.124]  You can't sleep anywhere.
[00:24:44.104 --> 00:24:47.646]  People say, oh, get them homeless people, treat them like garbage.
[00:24:48.527 --> 00:24:54.730]  Certainly some of them are obnoxious and are bums and are drug addicts, but some of them aren't, and there's more and more of them on the street.
[00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:58.552]  And the point is you shouldn't arrest somebody for sleeping on the street, folks.
[00:25:00.782 --> 00:25:02.244]  It's just flat wrong.
[00:25:03.464 --> 00:25:12.812]  But he was compassionate, and so he's being tried there in the police department, and they're trying to fire him and a bunch of other stuff, so we'll talk about that.
[00:25:12.832 --> 00:25:17.495]  I mean, whatever happened to compassion?
[00:25:19.377 --> 00:25:21.679]  Plus, why arrest a homeless person?
[00:25:21.979 --> 00:25:25.822]  They're just going to get released right back onto the street, and it just costs money for the taxpayers.
[00:25:30.245 --> 00:25:34.828]  By the way, we've got General Barry McCaffrey giving a press conference right now here in Austin, Texas.
[00:25:35.469 --> 00:25:37.550]  And I wish I could have gone, but some of our folks went.
[00:25:38.171 --> 00:25:45.956]  Last time he came to town, the former drug czar, we talked about his top narcotics man in Latin America being caught shipping cocaine and heroin into the country.
[00:25:45.976 --> 00:25:46.877]  He didn't want to talk about that.
[00:25:47.417 --> 00:25:52.881]  But now he's talking about how 50-something thousand people die from drugs every year.
[00:25:52.921 --> 00:25:54.482]  And I saw that number and said, wait a minute.
[00:25:55.439 --> 00:25:58.821]  Only a few thousand die from actual drugs each year, illegal drugs.
[00:25:59.361 --> 00:26:01.282]  Hundreds of thousands die from prescription drugs.
[00:26:01.322 --> 00:26:03.483]  I even had a mainstream news article about that last week.
[00:26:04.303 --> 00:26:06.204]  Where are they getting this 56,000 number?
[00:26:07.105 --> 00:26:12.948]  And sure enough, they were including alcohol deaths, which are eight times what narcotics deaths are.
[00:26:13.088 --> 00:26:13.908]  Yes, alcohol.
[00:26:14.729 --> 00:26:17.170]  And so I want to commend General McCaffrey.
[00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:21.512]  He's now adding alcohol to it and going to try to somehow...
[00:26:23.885 --> 00:26:26.146]  Put some anti-drug task force on that.
[00:26:26.186 --> 00:26:32.068]  But my point is, and I'm being sarcastic, the point is that you're not going to modify and change the way people live their lives.
[00:26:33.369 --> 00:26:34.409]  And the government knows that.
[00:26:35.229 --> 00:26:38.610]  And the bigger their drug war gets, the more drugs we have on our streets.
[00:26:41.031 --> 00:26:45.713]  Last time I saw federal numbers, this was like two years ago, and I know that it's gone up since then.
[00:26:45.733 --> 00:26:50.895]  I saw numbers on TV that it's gone up even more, but I read the actual federal numbers two years ago.
[00:26:51.924 --> 00:26:52.865]  But since then it's gone up.
[00:26:52.885 --> 00:26:53.825]  I don't have the numbers in front of me.
[00:26:53.845 --> 00:26:57.887]  But the old numbers I have is triple the heroin, double the cocaine on the streets.
[00:27:00.528 --> 00:27:02.689]  And since then it's even increased, if you can believe that.
[00:27:04.109 --> 00:27:09.131]  So more prisons, more police, more arrests, more SWAT raids, more drugs!
[00:27:11.872 --> 00:27:12.893]  Now why is that?
[00:27:13.593 --> 00:27:18.535]  Because these drugs are illegal, and so there's a black market.
[00:27:19.278 --> 00:27:27.241]  And nine out of ten home invasions and robberies are drug-related, so that's how they feed this government economy.
[00:27:27.841 --> 00:27:36.363]  And so then the scared population calls for more police and more loss of liberty, and there's more shootings and stabbings and the rest of it, so, oh, take my rights, keep me safe.
[00:27:36.824 --> 00:27:47.547]  And then the same people bringing in the drugs, the government bringing in the majority of the narcotics, they also own the private prisons, and then they also own the big pharmacological companies.
[00:27:50.495 --> 00:28:11.732]  They own the big drug companies who then push on the public, push on school children, push on pregnant women, push on the population, psychotropics, which are deadly, worse than cocaine and heroin, and stuff like Limbaugh likes, the hillbilly heroin.
[00:28:13.374 --> 00:28:16.056]  All of that, now they're going to push anti-psychotics.
[00:28:16.096 --> 00:28:17.337]  And again, I was just reading where
[00:28:18.175 --> 00:28:34.003]  Every school child, every year, whether you like it or not, is going to be given two psychological evaluations, and the parameters for the psychological examination has been written by a consortium of drug companies headed up by Eli Lilly.
[00:28:36.585 --> 00:28:39.306]  And then they even recommend their drugs.
[00:28:42.768 --> 00:28:44.689]  The public schools aren't just now...
[00:28:45.788 --> 00:28:46.328]  Prisons.
[00:28:46.408 --> 00:28:48.009]  Training your child how to be a prisoner.
[00:28:48.749 --> 00:28:54.291]  How to be thumb scanned and face scanned and frisked and searched and videotaped even in the locker rooms.
[00:28:55.231 --> 00:28:58.192]  Now, it's mind control facilities.
[00:29:01.813 --> 00:29:05.814]  And it's going to get worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.
[00:29:08.255 --> 00:29:11.156]  Here in Austin, if you're late three times to class...
[00:29:13.146 --> 00:29:18.888]  They call you into a little portable building and say, you're guilty of truancy, even though the state law doesn't say that.
[00:29:18.908 --> 00:29:21.188]  It says 14 unexcused absences in a semester.
[00:29:22.589 --> 00:29:25.030]  They say, sign here, deferred justification.
[00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:27.750]  And you don't know that you're supposed to have a jury and rights.
[00:29:28.291 --> 00:29:31.131]  Your parents sign it, and you're on probation.
[00:29:33.312 --> 00:29:35.193]  Then the judge says, I'm ordering drug testing.
[00:29:36.593 --> 00:29:38.293]  I'm ordering a psychological evaluation.
[00:29:38.313 --> 00:29:39.914]  This is even on local news, folks.
[00:29:42.901 --> 00:29:46.845]  We'll come back, get to your calls, the latest terror alerts, and a lot more.
[00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:51.170]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:53.252]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.193 --> 00:29:56.896]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.598 --> 00:30:03.719]  You can also waive out your mortgage debt and get a free and clear title.
[00:30:03.759 --> 00:30:06.681]  Mortgage elimination is usually completed in two or three months.
[00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:31.170]  We're good to go.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.221]  We're good to go.
[00:31:21.499 --> 00:31:22.160]  We're good to go.
[00:31:41.155 --> 00:31:42.036]  We're good to go.
[00:32:09.284 --> 00:32:09.965]  We're good to go.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.382]  Guaranteed level rates for the next 20 years.
[00:32:33.542 --> 00:32:36.625]  If you're a smoker, there are great rates available for you as well.
[00:32:36.845 --> 00:32:42.109]  Term Busters specializes in term life insurance policies of $500,000 or more.
[00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:44.711]  So call this number now for a free quote.
[00:32:44.731 --> 00:32:46.092]  800-430-6748 800-430-6748 We're here 24 hours a day.
[00:32:46.112 --> 00:32:46.372]  800-430-6748 800-430-6748
[00:33:02.153 --> 00:33:04.921]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:05.503 --> 00:33:08.772]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:15.237 --> 00:33:35.426]  All right, my friends, again, we're back live on this August 2, 2004, worldwide broadcast as we blast down on the AM and FM dial, simulcast on Global Shortwave during the day at 94.75, back from 9 to midnight Central at 32.10, and, of course, on the Internet at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:33:37.273 --> 00:33:37.613]  We're good to go.
[00:33:37.633 --> 00:33:38.233]  We're good to go.
[00:34:06.914 --> 00:34:13.158]  And if they do fall, we should ask ourselves who will be placing put options against what.
[00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:18.421]  Don't forget about the huge surge of insider trading just prior to September 11th.
[00:34:18.842 --> 00:34:20.643]  Check out our insider trading archive.
[00:34:20.663 --> 00:34:21.583]  We have a link to that.
[00:34:22.084 --> 00:34:30.289]  And remember how the Pentagon abandoned its twisted plan for a terrorism futures trading market after public uproar.
[00:34:32.794 --> 00:34:36.855]  And again, here's the latest fear-mongering brought to us, for what purpose?
[00:34:37.355 --> 00:34:38.816]  By the powers that be.
[00:34:39.896 --> 00:34:41.236]  And I'll tell you the main purpose.
[00:34:41.697 --> 00:34:51.539]  Bush is out there this morning announcing our new giant domestic CIA that Republicans and the Democrats all just think is great and is going to keep us so safe.
[00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:55.540]  I mean, think of all the horrible things the CIA has done internationally.
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:57.841]  All the things they've been caught doing domestically, illegally.
[00:34:59.267 --> 00:35:05.710]  Now it's going to be over all of government, rolled into Homeland Security and FEMA and NORTHCOM and all of it.
[00:35:07.531 --> 00:35:07.771]  U.S.
[00:35:07.791 --> 00:35:11.552]  says Al-Qaeda targets World Bank, New York Stock Exchange and Citigroup.
[00:35:12.713 --> 00:35:25.998]  Suspected Al-Qaeda threats to attack the New York Stock Exchange, World Bank and International Monetary Fund prompted the United States on Sunday to issue a high-level threat alert for the financial sector in New York and Washington.
[00:35:26.699 --> 00:35:27.579]  Buildings in New York...
[00:35:29.517 --> 00:35:40.682]  Of Citigroup, Inc., the world's largest financial company, and the Prudential Financial Building in Newark, New Jersey, were included in the warning announced by Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge at a news conference.
[00:35:41.902 --> 00:35:51.446]  In light of new intelligence information, we have made the decision to raise the threat level for this sector in these communities, he said.
[00:35:51.906 --> 00:35:52.847]  It was the first U.S.
[00:35:52.887 --> 00:35:56.188]  terror alert to focus on a specific sector of the economy.
[00:35:56.730 --> 00:36:02.292]  The high, or code orange, threat level is the second highest in the government's five-stage terrorism alert system.
[00:36:02.672 --> 00:36:05.413]  It represents a high risk of terrorist attacks, Ridge said.
[00:36:06.594 --> 00:36:14.676]  Sunday's warnings were based on a discovery of materials analyzing how to attack some of the most powerful symbols of Western capitalism.
[00:36:15.757 --> 00:36:24.320]  The quality of the intelligence is rarely seen and is alarming in both the amount and specificity of the information, Ridge said.
[00:36:25.922 --> 00:36:29.604]  President Bush agreed on Sunday to accept Bridge's recommendation to raise the threat level.
[00:36:30.164 --> 00:36:40.028]  White House spokesman Aaron Healy said the United States declared a national orange alert in December but cut it back to yellow or elevated in January.
[00:36:41.669 --> 00:36:44.631]  Both the IMF and World Bank are located within a few miles.
[00:36:44.731 --> 00:36:54.135]  Walk of the White House, Washington Police Chief Charles Ramsey said his department has beefed up coverage of the institutions as well as the Federal Reserve and Bureau of Engraving.
[00:36:55.413 --> 00:37:00.656]  They say they want to use truck bombs, like the 93 World Trade Center attack.
[00:37:00.816 --> 00:37:05.698]  Okay, the FBI admittedly cooked the bomb and trained the driver there and let the bombing go forward.
[00:37:05.718 --> 00:37:08.560]  Chicago Tribune, New York Times, In My Film, Road to Tyranny.
[00:37:11.081 --> 00:37:14.183]  They talk about back during Christmas, the Orange Alert.
[00:37:14.223 --> 00:37:17.164]  Well, it came out that that was, quote, a mistake or false intel.
[00:37:18.205 --> 00:37:23.788]  This is the same White House that's been caught planting fake letters from troops with false signatures in newspapers.
[00:37:24.762 --> 00:37:29.285]  Creating the Private Lynch fable with Jerry Bruckheimer, the Hollywood producer.
[00:37:30.066 --> 00:37:49.199]  This is the same government that's been caught planting fake weapons of mass destruction over and over again and then saying, oh, it was just an accident, lying about uranium from Niger, saying that open borders is an amnesty, saying that, I mean, just lying, lying, lying.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.521]  I don't know how you believe anything they say.
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:54.401]  Very, very serious.
[00:37:56.483 --> 00:37:59.065]  And I mentioned terror betting.
[00:37:59.105 --> 00:38:00.846]  Some people have trouble believing this.
[00:38:01.306 --> 00:38:02.907]  Every time I mention it, I get laughed at.
[00:38:02.927 --> 00:38:04.869]  This is out of the Associated Press last year.
[00:38:04.929 --> 00:38:05.409]  Remember this?
[00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:09.753]  Pentagon's futures market plan condemned.
[00:38:10.173 --> 00:38:11.034]  This is the AP.
[00:38:13.175 --> 00:38:13.836]  The Pentagon...
[00:38:14.656 --> 00:38:15.116]  We're good to go.
[00:38:15.136 --> 00:38:16.157]  We're good to go.
[00:38:44.136 --> 00:38:45.076]  And is grotesque.
[00:38:45.316 --> 00:38:45.577]  Okay.
[00:38:46.697 --> 00:38:54.179]  Senator Ron Whedon said, Folks, this is so the globalists can bet on their deeds and make money off of it publicly.
[00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:54.980]  That's all this is.
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:39:01.302]  It's legitimizing in plain view what they did on 9-11 with the insider trading on American and United.
[00:39:02.805 --> 00:39:10.712]  And only they know, and the good Lord above knows as well, what all this threat on the stock market did and where they profited from that.
[00:39:10.812 --> 00:39:12.754]  It's all very suspicious.
[00:39:12.774 --> 00:39:22.323]  But mainly I think it's a smokescreen to a backdrop for Bush with his announcement of this domestic CIA to run our lives and also for the election.
[00:39:23.371 --> 00:39:24.972]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to calls.
[00:39:25.012 --> 00:39:26.112]  I appreciate folks holding.
[00:39:26.532 --> 00:39:27.833]  Peter in New Jersey.
[00:39:27.913 --> 00:39:28.713]  Peter, go ahead.
[00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:37.937]  Good afternoon, Alex, and God bless you, and thank you for following God's calling for your life by getting out to us what we never hear from, quote-unquote, conservative talk radio.
[00:39:38.017 --> 00:39:38.777]  Well, thank you, sir.
[00:39:39.398 --> 00:39:41.399]  Okay, question for you.
[00:39:41.859 --> 00:39:49.382]  Where's the demarcation line versus the evil and the versus the good, the true terrorists, if you will?
[00:39:49.995 --> 00:39:51.516]  Well, number one, there are real Muslim terrorists.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:24.823]  But they car bomb people in the Middle East.
[00:40:24.843 --> 00:40:26.264]  They stab individuals.
[00:40:28.025 --> 00:40:29.026]  They shoot people.
[00:40:31.187 --> 00:40:35.870]  And in most cases in the Middle East, it really is a disaffected, angry group.
[00:40:37.748 --> 00:40:44.070]  But four jets being hijacked, NORAD standing down, public officials being warned not to fly the night before.
[00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:46.790]  You know, that whole official story is a fraud.
[00:40:47.131 --> 00:40:50.652]  We know their official story concerning 9-11 is a lie.
[00:40:50.992 --> 00:40:57.513]  We know there's total prior knowledge and fostering and funding and enabling of terrorists of 9-11.
[00:40:59.274 --> 00:41:06.936]  Now, let's say that Al-Qaeda was real and wasn't publicly founded by the CIA and protected and all the evidence that we have.
[00:41:08.368 --> 00:41:09.849]  The government is doing nothing.
[00:41:09.889 --> 00:41:16.734]  They're leaving the borders open, ordering thousands of Muslims picked up at border states to be released.
[00:41:18.355 --> 00:41:20.296]  They're doing nothing to protect us.
[00:41:20.917 --> 00:41:24.359]  And all of this is being used to set up a police state.
[00:41:24.679 --> 00:41:28.302]  They're using the Patriot Act to charge people that have nothing to do with terrorism.
[00:41:28.822 --> 00:41:30.403]  They are federalizing our cities.
[00:41:30.723 --> 00:41:35.847]  So regardless, they're using these horrible events to destroy our freedoms.
[00:41:36.681 --> 00:41:38.341]  And here's the key thing.
[00:41:38.461 --> 00:41:45.643]  Long before Al-Qaeda attacked al-Ciata, they were setting up this end of posse comitatus, this New World Order.
[00:41:45.743 --> 00:41:50.384]  So regardless, giving up our freedoms does nothing.
[00:41:50.744 --> 00:41:55.125]  It doesn't protect us, and it empowers the New World Order, and it kills America.
[00:41:57.306 --> 00:42:01.907]  Well, again, I appreciate all that you're doing, and thank you so much for all your wealth of knowledge.
[00:42:02.207 --> 00:42:03.427]  Well, thank you, Peter, for the call.
[00:42:03.467 --> 00:42:06.228]  Oh, you have something else to say?
[00:42:06.769 --> 00:42:07.750]  No, that's it, Alex.
[00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.710]  Okay, thank you.
[00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:09.151]  Take care.
[00:42:09.831 --> 00:42:10.972]  Mark in Pennsylvania.
[00:42:11.012 --> 00:42:11.813]  Mark, you're on the air.
[00:42:11.873 --> 00:42:12.293]  Go ahead.
[00:42:12.894 --> 00:42:13.574]  Hi, Alex.
[00:42:13.594 --> 00:42:14.555]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:42:14.635 --> 00:42:15.175]  You bet, my friend.
[00:42:15.195 --> 00:42:15.515]  Go ahead.
[00:42:15.535 --> 00:42:16.156]  Yeah, thank you.
[00:42:16.256 --> 00:42:17.177]  A couple things.
[00:42:17.237 --> 00:42:23.862]  I was wondering, I saw a Manchurian candidate, and there was a couple of really interesting things in it.
[00:42:23.922 --> 00:42:32.548]  The gentleman that Mr. Voight plays, the character he plays, in the beginning of the movie, talks about losing our freedoms, and he's kind of portrayed as the bad guy.
[00:42:33.869 --> 00:42:34.670]  Also, there were...
[00:42:36.325 --> 00:42:53.338]  There's kids playing, kind of dressed up as Abraham Lincoln Washington, and Denzel Washington's character comes through in the scene, these kids staging this thing, and the kid says, and your Bill of Rights gives you the right to it, and then they cut it off.
[00:42:54.479 --> 00:43:01.885]  Then, throughout the movie, I see armed military personnel on the street.
[00:43:02.762 --> 00:43:03.122]  Mm-hmm.
[00:43:03.142 --> 00:43:03.282]  Right.
[00:43:03.302 --> 00:43:03.442]  Mm-hmm.
[00:43:32.979 --> 00:43:38.400]  And they, it implies they're carrying out the terror attacks.
[00:43:39.321 --> 00:43:40.941]  They've got a police state in America.
[00:43:40.981 --> 00:43:42.841]  They've got troops on all the street corners.
[00:43:44.042 --> 00:43:45.182]  They're searching people.
[00:43:46.642 --> 00:43:54.224]  And then you find out, I don't want to give away too much of the movie, but there are these huge gaggles of mind control slaves.
[00:43:56.124 --> 00:43:58.925]  And then if you've studied mind control, that's exactly how they do it.
[00:44:00.226 --> 00:44:09.289]  They would take troops out into the field and hit them with knockout gas so that they have an excuse to wake up in hospital beds later.
[00:44:09.309 --> 00:44:12.630]  Kind of like the original Manchurian candidate.
[00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:13.791]  That's actually how they do it.
[00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:15.531]  I mean, they did that in Vietnam.
[00:44:15.551 --> 00:44:20.173]  They'd take guys out in the field, knock them out, they'd wake up six months later totally reprogrammed.
[00:44:22.414 --> 00:44:26.475]  And they've got tracker chips in them, which the troops are now getting, by the way.
[00:44:27.335 --> 00:44:29.136]  And they've got brain chips and...
[00:44:30.598 --> 00:44:47.661]  You can look at the movie as people in Hollywood trying to warn the public, and I think the directors and producers think that's what happened, but overall, I believe that the production house allowed this because it'll just desensitize people overall unless they're conscious.
[00:44:47.961 --> 00:44:55.523]  Yeah, and that's what I was going to get about when you said about capitalism, when the men said capitalism by support of communism.
[00:44:56.141 --> 00:45:03.186]  You ask that to a 20-something or 30-something-year-old person today, and they say, well, it isn't socialism, but that's what communism is, though.
[00:45:03.887 --> 00:45:04.788]  It's just a mask.
[00:45:05.508 --> 00:45:06.869]  Well, it's all command and control.
[00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:11.693]  I mean, communism, socialism, fascism, powerful people want control.
[00:45:12.113 --> 00:45:13.154]  They want to run your life.
[00:45:13.194 --> 00:45:14.255]  I mean, it's just history.
[00:45:14.956 --> 00:45:16.377]  But overall, what did you think of the film?
[00:45:17.017 --> 00:45:19.859]  I don't know.
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:23.062]  I give it, out of four stars, I give it two.
[00:45:23.082 --> 00:45:25.864]  The thing is, I have the original.
[00:45:26.716 --> 00:45:33.301]  And I've watched it over and over, and I just thought it was kind of sugar-coated a bit.
[00:45:33.921 --> 00:45:43.688]  But there were significant things in the movie, like I said before, about John Boyd's character, that he was kind of a voice of freedom because he was talking about that.
[00:45:43.908 --> 00:45:44.549]  And they kill him.
[00:45:45.029 --> 00:45:45.389]  Correct.
[00:45:45.909 --> 00:45:48.031]  I don't want to say anything.
[00:45:48.151 --> 00:45:55.136]  And they kill him just like they killed the CIA director two days after he leaked the Waco flare footage.
[00:45:55.655 --> 00:45:58.737]  Right, and also the gentleman that got the job at the Twin Towers.
[00:46:00.218 --> 00:46:02.459]  You know, this O'Neill guy, whatever his name is.
[00:46:02.559 --> 00:46:03.820]  I think that's what his name was.
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:06.242]  But I wanted to ask you about the 9-11 Commission.
[00:46:06.262 --> 00:46:10.144]  Were there any structural engineers put in front of the Commission?
[00:46:11.025 --> 00:46:18.069]  The 9-11 Commission, when it formed last year, said, we are not going to make judgment calls.
[00:46:18.189 --> 00:46:22.132]  We are going to call for a domestic CIA and Patriot Act II.
[00:46:24.294 --> 00:46:32.516]  So, from the beginning, they said what it was, they said what they were going to do, and it's nothing but a giant advertisement for the New World Order.
[00:46:32.816 --> 00:46:40.539]  Right, because there's nothing that they said anything about how it happened, but only how you... Well, really, they just told a bunch of lies, is what they did.
[00:46:40.879 --> 00:46:43.999]  I've now read most of the report, and it's just unbelievable lies.
[00:46:44.019 --> 00:46:49.341]  Because King, when I researched, King was on the board of directors of Hess, which is also...
[00:46:51.268 --> 00:46:57.332]  Well, I mean, Keene is in business with the Bin Laden family.
[00:46:57.672 --> 00:46:57.972]  Correct.
[00:46:58.552 --> 00:47:02.895]  Even the cow had the payroll of Harman Karzai.
[00:47:03.295 --> 00:47:09.479]  Well, the head of the committee, the head staffer, you know, is an intelligence guy.
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:10.920]  The whole thing's a joke.
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:15.183]  I mean, again, for those that have trouble figuring this out, it's appointed by Bush.
[00:47:15.223 --> 00:47:17.965]  The first guy they tried to have headed was Henry Kissinger.
[00:47:17.985 --> 00:47:18.125]  Mm-hmm.
[00:47:18.957 --> 00:47:22.839]  So to just give you an idea, they just gave you more little-known Henry Kissinger types.
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:25.661]  Well, I appreciate your time.
[00:47:25.681 --> 00:47:30.003]  I can't get you really good on the frequency, the frequency that you have now.
[00:47:30.744 --> 00:47:34.466]  I mean, I can barely make you out.
[00:47:35.546 --> 00:47:37.448]  Are you listening to us on AM FM Shortwave?
[00:47:37.688 --> 00:47:38.088]  Shortwave.
[00:47:39.091 --> 00:47:45.835]  Well, sir, you might get a better shortwave, or you might get a computer, or you might just call a local AM or FM and tell them to pick the show up.
[00:47:46.135 --> 00:47:47.736]  Well, I've been trying to do that.
[00:47:48.016 --> 00:47:48.656]  Well, that's awesome.
[00:47:48.676 --> 00:47:49.497]  Thanks for the call, Mark.
[00:47:50.057 --> 00:47:50.757]  I appreciate it.
[00:47:51.538 --> 00:47:52.979]  Let's talk to Paul in Delaware.
[00:47:53.039 --> 00:47:53.799]  Paul, go ahead.
[00:47:53.819 --> 00:47:54.920]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:55.320]  Fine.
[00:47:56.561 --> 00:47:57.141]  I'm calling in.
[00:47:57.181 --> 00:48:08.067]  I'm doing my one call per week, and I would like to just say I would like to apologize for my attitude and spirit of trying to get to the bottom of the truth in education.
[00:48:09.165 --> 00:48:09.866]  That's funny.
[00:48:10.266 --> 00:48:11.006]  Okay, okay.
[00:48:11.026 --> 00:48:16.930]  Well, you should review your shows, and I'm glad you have them for sale so people can review our discussion.
[00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:17.990]  I don't have them for sale.
[00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:18.751]  The network does.
[00:48:18.931 --> 00:48:20.872]  Okay, but my main point was this.
[00:48:21.532 --> 00:48:35.861]  The reason why I'm trying to get the word out and trying to educate people is because I've been in this movement for eight years, and every single well-known person I see has been a charlatan.
[00:48:36.341 --> 00:48:37.322]  Not speaking of you.
[00:48:38.644 --> 00:48:45.425]  But you have encouraged me from watching your videos from years ago to take action, and that's what I'm doing.
[00:48:46.105 --> 00:48:52.087]  And so I just want to let people know, I've been in this movement for a while, and I've seen a bunch of charlatans.
[00:48:52.127 --> 00:48:58.928]  I know you don't like to speak about them, but I must say, you've convinced me to start making my own documentaries.
[00:48:59.048 --> 00:49:04.749]  And the first one I'm going to do is to investigate all these charlatans who failed to uncover
[00:49:05.282 --> 00:49:05.982]  Certain truths.
[00:49:06.162 --> 00:49:11.905]  And what I see is there are certain issues, Alex, that you fail and will not talk about.
[00:49:11.945 --> 00:49:17.287]  And I don't know why, but if you would like to tell me, you can reach me at awakenfree.com.
[00:49:17.367 --> 00:49:20.888]  Okay, sir, we're not here to promote your personal platform, okay?
[00:49:21.148 --> 00:49:22.949]  Go make your films and promote them somewhere else.
[00:49:23.009 --> 00:49:23.589]  Thanks for the call.
[00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:25.450]  All right.
[00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:33.253]  Look, I let you call into the show, let you do your dissension, let you try that stuff, and it isn't going to work on me.
[00:49:35.337 --> 00:49:42.280]  And by everybody's a charlatan, I guess you mean you can find somebody saying something bad about anybody out there who's in the arena?
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:44.401]  I mean, is that what you mean?
[00:49:44.421 --> 00:49:52.704]  No, I don't get into infighting and talking bad about people, and this person isn't good and that person's not good, and I don't make my life out of that.
[00:49:53.084 --> 00:49:54.285]  That's not what this show is.
[00:49:54.425 --> 00:50:01.768]  Many of the other broadcasts do that, just up one side and down the other, and I don't, sir.
[00:50:03.197 --> 00:50:05.959]  Look, they're going to try to forcibly drug our children.
[00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:10.203]  They're going to psychologically test us, the children, then the adults.
[00:50:10.423 --> 00:50:13.386]  They're setting up a police state.
[00:50:13.406 --> 00:50:15.208]  They're putting out all these terror alerts.
[00:50:15.268 --> 00:50:17.650]  They're doing all of this.
[00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:23.975]  And so many of you guys, you call in and you say, do you think we went to the moon?
[00:50:25.016 --> 00:50:26.377]  And I say, I don't know.
[00:50:26.397 --> 00:50:28.259]  And you say, what do you mean you don't know?
[00:50:29.033 --> 00:50:30.413]  And I said, well, we can study that.
[00:50:30.453 --> 00:50:31.914]  You got any guests you want me to have on?
[00:50:31.954 --> 00:50:33.474]  You're like, you're bad.
[00:50:33.514 --> 00:50:34.394]  You're covering it up.
[00:50:34.434 --> 00:50:35.634]  You're twisting.
[00:50:36.334 --> 00:50:38.715]  I mean, you've got a bad attitude, buddy.
[00:50:40.195 --> 00:50:45.416]  And I mean, I don't know what your job is or what's going on, but that's fine.
[00:50:45.436 --> 00:50:48.556]  You want to have some weird personal obsession with me?
[00:50:48.576 --> 00:50:49.877]  You know, I don't know.
[00:50:50.357 --> 00:50:51.857]  I just don't want to be involved in it.
[00:50:53.057 --> 00:50:56.818]  All right, we'll be right back and get to real news and information.
[00:50:56.858 --> 00:50:57.778]  It's really important.
[00:50:58.490 --> 00:50:59.931]  And more of your calls and a guest, too.
[00:51:00.111 --> 00:51:06.957]  Hey, folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:07.257 --> 00:51:08.638]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[00:51:08.838 --> 00:51:11.020]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:13.281]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:13.562 --> 00:51:18.485]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.

[00:54:08.363 --> 00:54:11.204]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:16.826 --> 00:54:22.568]  All right, Eric and Kevin and Jackie and Randy and everybody else, your calls are coming up.
[00:54:24.128 --> 00:54:34.172]  Got an article here where if you want to get in one of the public meetings, they call them public town halls with Dick Cheney, you've got to give them your name, phone number, driver's license number.
[00:54:35.455 --> 00:54:40.696]  And then you have to sign a pledge that you support the vice president.
[00:54:42.616 --> 00:54:49.458]  Now, I remember back in the 80s going to a George Bush rally with my dad at the fairgrounds in Dallas, Texas.
[00:54:50.338 --> 00:54:52.518]  And you didn't have to sign a pledge to get into it.
[00:54:52.558 --> 00:54:53.199]  You didn't have to.
[00:54:53.219 --> 00:54:58.420]  I mean, I've been to many other presidential events over the years and gubernatorial events.
[00:54:58.460 --> 00:54:59.040]  They don't do that.
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:54:59.840]  But now they do.
[00:55:01.687 --> 00:55:07.152]  To get into these Patriot Act discussions that they had last year where they were out, you know, stumping for it coast to coast.
[00:55:07.192 --> 00:55:10.474]  And earlier this year, they would make you do similar things.
[00:55:10.494 --> 00:55:21.344]  I mean, how in a free society are they so bunkered down, so afraid of, at their media events, the people seeing that everyone is not buying it?
[00:55:22.405 --> 00:55:26.908]  That reminds me of Bush, what, almost two years ago in St.
[00:55:26.968 --> 00:55:29.951]  Louis with the Made in China speech.
[00:55:31.059 --> 00:55:37.061]  Labels covered up at the warehouse with Made in USA spray-painted and stenciled on them.
[00:55:39.622 --> 00:55:40.822]  I mean, how ridiculous.
[00:55:42.503 --> 00:55:44.023]  And, by the way, that broke a federal law.
[00:55:44.043 --> 00:55:44.924]  You're not supposed to do that.
[00:55:44.964 --> 00:55:48.105]  It's a felony, according to the Village Voice.
[00:55:49.325 --> 00:55:51.946]  And then on top of it, Bush was in Indiana last year.
[00:55:51.966 --> 00:55:53.286]  There's a bunch of examples of this.
[00:55:54.067 --> 00:55:56.627]  They told everybody, take your ties off or you've got to leave.
[00:55:56.687 --> 00:55:57.428]  Some people refused.
[00:55:57.448 --> 00:55:58.128]  They were thrown out.
[00:55:58.763 --> 00:56:02.265]  Take your ties off, because we don't want the image of people with ties.
[00:56:02.305 --> 00:56:05.166]  I mean, that's how manipulative all of this is.
[00:56:08.648 --> 00:56:10.089]  And Kerry does the same stuff.
[00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:15.372]  So just realize what an illusion all of this is.
[00:56:18.793 --> 00:56:27.478]  Okay, now, some of the other news that's coming up, there's just so much of it that I want to...
[00:56:29.315 --> 00:56:30.116]  Go over here.
[00:56:30.776 --> 00:56:36.481]  One article is out of Christianity Today, and it says, I was in prison and you abused me.
[00:56:38.323 --> 00:56:43.907]  And the writer, Stephen Gertz, is saying, what's happened to Christians?
[00:56:43.927 --> 00:56:50.833]  Because he hears these so-called Christians on talk radio, and he talks to them in person, who think the torture isn't bad or, frankly, love it.
[00:56:52.455 --> 00:56:54.016]  Since when is torture Christians?
[00:56:55.928 --> 00:56:57.809]  We'll discuss that as well.
[00:56:57.849 --> 00:57:07.555]  We've also, just for 10-15 minutes, got Norman Siegel, the lawyer for a New York officer on trial for refusing to arrest a homeless man.
[00:57:07.595 --> 00:57:08.596]  That's coming up too.
[00:57:09.977 --> 00:57:24.166]  Before I end this hour, I would encourage all of you to visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and to visit the secure, safe online shopping cart

[00:58:40.596 --> 00:58:44.358]  All right, we'll be back on the other side of this quick 70-second break.
[00:58:45.238 --> 00:58:48.460]  With your calls, guests, and a ton of other vital news, please stay with us.
[00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.770]  Hello!
[00:58:56.974 --> 00:58:57.615]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.275 --> 00:58:59.336]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.057 --> 00:59:01.157]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.798 --> 00:59:02.619]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.399 --> 00:59:04.260]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:08.683]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.124 --> 00:59:13.187]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.465 --> 00:59:18.486]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:59:19.186 --> 00:59:20.587]  It is the second day of August 2004.
[00:59:20.927 --> 00:59:32.613]  On this Monday edition, hour number two, your calls and a ton of news with Ridge's latest terror alerts, supposedly specific.
[00:59:34.053 --> 00:59:43.838]  Just a ton of news concerning Iraq and also this report of them wanting to psychologically test every American, forcibly, by the way, and then...
[00:59:44.961 --> 00:59:45.561]  We're good to go.
[01:00:13.516 --> 01:00:19.879]  And the police officer, 39, could be kicked off the force if an administrative judge finds him guilty of failing to obey a lawful order.
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:22.301]  And the police say an order is an order.
[01:00:22.361 --> 01:00:24.862]  You must follow all orders, whether you like it or not.
[01:00:25.442 --> 01:00:27.123]  I thought we heard that in Nazi Germany.
[01:00:27.543 --> 01:00:32.406]  No, you've got to follow your oath of office to serve and protect and defend and be a public servant.
[01:00:33.126 --> 01:00:35.668]  But we're joined by Norman Siegel, high-powered attorney.
[01:00:36.168 --> 01:00:37.869]  And, Norman, good to have you on.
[01:00:38.539 --> 01:00:39.500]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:40.821]  It's a pleasure to be on your show.
[01:00:40.941 --> 01:00:41.261]  You bet.
[01:00:41.641 --> 01:00:49.968]  We're going to break here in just a few minutes and come back in a longer segment, but just give us the basics of where this happened, how this happened, what's going on, and the public's response and what you're doing to counter this.
[01:00:50.528 --> 01:01:07.681]  The police department in New York City charged Officer Eduardo De La Cruz with a single act of refusing to comply with a lawful order, that being refusing to arrest a homeless man who was sleeping in a private parking garage located on 15th Street near Union Square.
[01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:08.888]  In Manhattan.
[01:01:09.709 --> 01:01:27.298]  And we had thought that we had worked out an agreement that the 30-day suspension without pay that he received back in November of 2002 when this incident occurred was adequate punishment for this matter.
[01:01:27.818 --> 01:01:37.283]  However, recently the police department said, no, we want to take him to trial, which means that there's a possibility that
[01:01:37.777 --> 01:01:39.378]  That he will be terminated.
[01:01:39.398 --> 01:01:40.979]  He's a 10-year veteran.
[01:01:40.999 --> 01:01:43.740]  He has five children, a wife.
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.681]  He has an unblemished record.
[01:01:46.441 --> 01:02:02.469]  And we are vigorously defending him by alleging, one, that the facts around that incident in question are not that clear, that the sergeant was the one who handcuffed the homeless person.
[01:02:03.049 --> 01:02:06.031]  The sergeant then says to him, he's yours.
[01:02:06.582 --> 01:02:08.503]  As opposed to, I'm giving you a direct order.
[01:02:09.243 --> 01:02:12.665]  The sergeant says, different, but that's a question of fact.
[01:02:12.705 --> 01:02:33.413]  But even assuming there was a direct order, we argue that they singled out De La Cruz, they manufactured this arrest, they went to great lengths to set him up, to confront him with this situation, and even assuming that they could do all of the above, enough, 30 days,
[01:02:35.982 --> 01:02:37.084]  ...is adequate punishment.
[01:02:37.865 --> 01:02:48.342]  We have precedent here where police officers beat people up, engage in racial epithets, they don't get terminated, and the 30 days is more than adequate punishment.
[01:02:49.062 --> 01:02:59.406]  Well, I mean, we've got police going in the wrong house and blowing some old man in half, and then they get a 30-day suspension, and then the grand jury no-bills the indictment, and they're back on the force.
[01:02:59.466 --> 01:03:07.408]  But this is a good police officer who showed some basic restraint, something we need a little bit more of, and they're trying to get him fired.
[01:03:07.449 --> 01:03:08.609]  I mean, this is outrageous.
[01:03:08.949 --> 01:03:14.451]  Well, I think that's correct, and people in New York have been very supportive of
[01:03:14.887 --> 01:03:15.587]  We're good to go.
[01:03:37.689 --> 01:03:40.413]  Homeless advocates inform homeless people in the courtroom.
[01:03:40.533 --> 01:03:41.574]  We've got a break, sir.
[01:03:41.615 --> 01:03:41.975]  Stay there.
[01:03:41.995 --> 01:03:43.317]  We'll be right back with Norman Siegel.
[01:03:43.698 --> 01:03:48.204]  He's the lawyer for Mr. De La Cruz, a good police officer under attack.
[01:03:48.224 --> 01:03:48.625]  Stay with us.
[01:03:51.724 --> 01:03:52.184]  We're good to go.
[01:03:52.285 --> 01:03:52.805]  We're good to go.
[01:04:11.892 --> 01:04:12.533]  We're good to go.
[01:04:34.993 --> 01:04:36.355]  Best of all, it's affordable.
[01:04:36.715 --> 01:04:40.320]  It's only $385 and that includes the shipping.
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:50.011]  So call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340 for your personal ozone generator or visit on the web at cliffscott.com.
[01:04:51.431 --> 01:04:59.337]  Skyrocketing oil prices, the economy on the brink, the plunging dollar, terrorism, the government spending $1.80 for every dollar it collects.
[01:04:59.657 --> 01:05:04.920]  Never in the history of our country have we faced so many threats to our freedoms, rights and individual security.
[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:07.702]  How long can we continue without a fracture occurring?
[01:05:07.842 --> 01:05:12.986]  With the events that recently rocked the elections in Spain, what will happen as we get closer to our own elections?

[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.801]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:05:55.023 --> 01:05:56.303]  Alex Jones here, America.

[01:06:12.407 --> 01:06:16.188]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[01:06:16.448 --> 01:06:21.089]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:06:21.169 --> 01:06:23.910]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:27.412]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[01:06:27.472 --> 01:06:29.333]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:06:47.523 --> 01:06:49.564]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:06:57.150 --> 01:06:57.790]  Big Brother.
[01:06:58.451 --> 01:06:59.491]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.212 --> 01:07:01.312]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:01.972 --> 01:07:02.793]  You want answers?
[01:07:03.553 --> 01:07:04.434]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:04.454 --> 01:07:08.796]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.296 --> 01:07:13.398]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.001]  All right, my friends, we're talking to Norman Siegel.
[01:07:20.061 --> 01:07:25.184]  He's the New York attorney representing...
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:38.069]  Officer De La Cruz, the police department put an officer on trial Wednesday for refusing to arrest a homeless man who was sleeping in a parking garage.
[01:07:38.809 --> 01:07:47.616]  Eduardo De La Cruz, 39, could be kicked off the force if an administrative judge finds him guilty of failing to obey a lawful order.
[01:07:48.587 --> 01:07:57.915]  The incident occurred in November 2002, shortly after the department adopted a zero-tolerance policy to violations by homeless people.
[01:07:59.176 --> 01:08:06.181]  An attorney for De La Cruz, Norman Siegel, who we have on the line, accused officials of punishing his client for following his conscience.
[01:08:07.002 --> 01:08:11.626]  De La Cruz saw the homeless as people and showed them dignity and respect, Siegel said.
[01:08:13.038 --> 01:08:22.384]  Police lawyer David Green argued that De La Cruz's personal beliefs are completely irrelevant, and the case, quote, begins and ends with the refusal of an order.
[01:08:22.664 --> 01:08:25.586]  The officer told reporters outside court that he hoped to keep his badge.
[01:08:26.007 --> 01:08:27.668]  I'm a good police officer, he said.
[01:08:28.588 --> 01:08:29.929]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[01:08:29.969 --> 01:08:32.851]  I've read New York articles saying the guy's got an exemplary record.
[01:08:33.211 --> 01:08:34.032]  He's a good cop.
[01:08:34.612 --> 01:08:40.196]  You know, we've had former New York City detectives and others on this broadcast who back in the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s,
[01:08:42.492 --> 01:08:46.214]  They would try to get him to take money, be part of the drug dealing, be part of the corruption.
[01:08:46.254 --> 01:08:47.595]  I'm not saying that's happening here.
[01:08:48.336 --> 01:08:50.437]  But if you refuse, they would kick you out.
[01:08:51.338 --> 01:08:52.638]  And this guy's a good cop.
[01:08:53.499 --> 01:08:55.901]  And folks, they've got these laws against homeless.
[01:08:55.981 --> 01:08:57.221]  Where are they supposed to sleep?
[01:08:57.602 --> 01:08:58.762]  Where are they supposed to go?
[01:09:00.183 --> 01:09:06.027]  Certainly, if the homeless person was belligerent or tried to fight the officers, then fine.
[01:09:06.067 --> 01:09:07.348]  Arrest him, charge him, whatever.
[01:09:07.428 --> 01:09:07.528]  But
[01:09:08.188 --> 01:09:11.491]  Just asleep or asleep on a bench or asleep in a garage, whatever.
[01:09:11.871 --> 01:09:12.532]  Kick them out.
[01:09:13.192 --> 01:09:14.273]  But arrest them?
[01:09:14.313 --> 01:09:15.194]  I mean, what's the point?
[01:09:15.474 --> 01:09:21.359]  But the reason I think this article is important is that you've got to follow orders.
[01:09:21.419 --> 01:09:22.300]  That's what you've got to do.
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:23.160]  That's your job.
[01:09:23.281 --> 01:09:24.041]  No, it's not.
[01:09:25.402 --> 01:09:27.404]  Following orders will not cut it.
[01:09:27.444 --> 01:09:31.547]  I mean, what about when they ordered the officers to use a toilet plunger on a man?
[01:09:32.128 --> 01:09:34.690]  Or what about when they order officers to go in a house without a warrant?
[01:09:35.273 --> 01:09:37.454]  Or what about when they order officers to do all of this?
[01:09:38.035 --> 01:09:46.460]  We need to support officers that do show restraint and that do not go around in this abusive manner.
[01:09:47.781 --> 01:10:00.188]  Now, I know it's kind of a national sport to hate the homeless and to make fun of them and to call them names, but homeless are people too, and they run the gamut of folks that are really down their luck to drug addicts.
[01:10:00.629 --> 01:10:03.150]  But the point is they deserve the same rights as everybody else.
[01:10:03.851 --> 01:10:03.991]  But...
[01:10:04.907 --> 01:10:09.248]  Now this police officer is under attack, and his lawyer, Norman Siegel, joins us.
[01:10:10.448 --> 01:10:17.430]  Norman, you talked about him trying to set up Mr. De La Cruz, or there being some evidence to make you think that might be going on.
[01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:18.710]  Can you elaborate on that, please?
[01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:19.290]  Sure.
[01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:30.753]  When this unit, which dealt with homeless people, changed its policy in October of 2002 because there were more homeless once again out on the streets,
[01:10:31.614 --> 01:10:31.694]  Yes.
[01:10:32.054 --> 01:10:37.357]  Previously what they did is they would go over to a homeless person and ask them to go to the shelter.
[01:10:39.478 --> 01:10:43.479]  With the new policy came different practice.
[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:50.262]  Dela Cruz was prevented from saying to someone, if you don't go to the shelter, you're going to go to jail.
[01:10:51.323 --> 01:10:54.084]  In the instant that we're talking about,
[01:10:54.857 --> 01:11:01.341]  Dela Cruz actually asked the guy if he wanted to go to the shelter and that if he didn't go to the shelter, he'd go to jail.
[01:11:01.701 --> 01:11:04.183]  And the homeless guy said, all right, I'll go to the shelter.
[01:11:04.643 --> 01:11:11.387]  And then the sergeant, according to Dela Cruz, said it's too late because the sergeant had already asked him whether he wanted to go to the shelter.
[01:11:12.548 --> 01:11:15.150]  Basically, they created an arrest quota.
[01:11:15.810 --> 01:11:20.233]  One homeless person, well, not one homeless, one arrest a week
[01:11:20.859 --> 01:11:21.399]  We're good to go.
[01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:44.794]  We're good to go.
[01:12:04.372 --> 01:12:10.758]  On his natural tour of duty, and while he was walking the street or driving his car, he came across the homeless person.
[01:12:10.818 --> 01:12:14.161]  He was directed to go there, and that's why I say he was set up.
[01:12:15.322 --> 01:12:22.148]  Again, we're talking to Norman Siegel, the New York lawyer for Mr. De La Cruz, this good officer.
[01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:30.335]  Let me also ask the point about being a good police officer, and De La Cruz is exactly that.
[01:12:31.022 --> 01:12:36.303]  You should not judge a police officer's performance based on an arrest quota.
[01:12:37.083 --> 01:12:39.364]  It should be based on the overall performance.
[01:12:39.824 --> 01:12:46.385]  And it really does put some spotlight on why are police departments having quotas with regard to arrests.
[01:12:46.526 --> 01:12:49.966]  Okay, well, Mr. Siegel, you're stealing my thunder.
[01:12:50.006 --> 01:12:52.327]  That's where I was going next because you just mentioned that earlier.
[01:12:52.367 --> 01:12:53.467]  I want to steal your thunder, Alex.
[01:12:55.247 --> 01:12:57.048]  Absolutely, because...
[01:12:58.180 --> 01:12:58.861]  We're good to go.
[01:13:20.879 --> 01:13:28.124]  Just absolute abuse against the people, and even the police don't want to be part of this.
[01:13:28.144 --> 01:13:29.144]  Can you elaborate on that?
[01:13:29.464 --> 01:13:29.725]  Sure.
[01:13:29.825 --> 01:13:37.909]  I think that there are people who join the police department, like Della Cruz, who join the police department to help people, to provide services.
[01:13:38.690 --> 01:13:47.135]  And some of the practices that are now going on, some which you mentioned just now, are not why they became police officers.
[01:13:47.617 --> 01:13:48.738]  And they have some concerns.
[01:13:48.939 --> 01:13:55.246]  However, the police department is a quasi-military operation, so you have internal concerns, grumblings.
[01:13:55.877 --> 01:14:07.625]  And the practices that are now taking place, there are some police officers who are not in favor of that, but they have to take the orders and they have to then do what they're told to do.
[01:14:08.105 --> 01:14:24.797]  On the other hand, a case like this brings into focus the practices and the management of the police department, and perhaps people in New York City, and perhaps this is applicable to police departments all across the country, need to take a look at what's going on and whether or not there are arrest quotas and whether that's good policy or not.
[01:14:25.313 --> 01:14:30.134]  Well, here in Austin a few weeks ago, our sheriff said we are a paramilitary organization.
[01:14:30.514 --> 01:14:31.935]  They call us civilians.
[01:14:31.975 --> 01:14:35.135]  You mentioned quasi-military operation.
[01:14:35.856 --> 01:14:37.276]  They're citizens just like us.
[01:14:37.356 --> 01:14:42.497]  If we're civilians and they're the military, it means that we're in a military state.
[01:14:43.017 --> 01:14:45.858]  And this whole us-against-them, black ski mask thing,
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:49.601]  Well, I think these are difficult times post-9-11, especially here in New York.
[01:14:49.621 --> 01:14:51.662]  You know, we rely on our government.
[01:14:51.722 --> 01:14:52.162]  We hear...
[01:15:13.099 --> 01:15:16.242]  Even yesterday about the alert and the targets.
[01:15:17.184 --> 01:15:21.749]  I think that we as citizens want to believe in our government.
[01:15:21.809 --> 01:15:22.910]  We want to trust our government.
[01:15:23.471 --> 01:15:26.134]  We want to work with the law enforcement community, including the police.
[01:15:27.107 --> 01:15:39.313]  But sometimes there's questions about what's going on, and I think that people should understand that when people raise questions, or even if they dissent, that's healthy for a democracy, and we should not be discouraging that.
[01:15:39.393 --> 01:15:44.436]  We should be thankful that people care about the democracy, that they're raising these important questions.
[01:15:44.596 --> 01:15:52.200]  Well, obviously it's all being used for a big fat power grab, and much of it has nothing to do with terrorism, but since you bring this up and you're in New York, Mr. Siegel,
[01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:58.184]  What has the effect been of Ridge's alert, the orange alert for New York and D.C.
[01:15:58.244 --> 01:16:08.732]  and parts of New Jersey, saying that specific threats and they've got one of the tunnels, New York's Holland Tunnel, has been shut down.
[01:16:09.332 --> 01:16:11.314]  What do the streets look like right now in New York?
[01:16:11.954 --> 01:16:15.957]  I think it's a normal day, although there's, I think, increased anxiety.
[01:16:16.938 --> 01:16:18.019]  You hear these reports.
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:20.941]  Many of us remember
[01:16:21.442 --> 01:16:27.467]  9-11 and that will be in our memories for the rest of our lives.
[01:16:27.907 --> 01:16:31.570]  So when you hear these alerts, there is an increased anxiety.
[01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:46.242]  On the other hand, we believe, I believe, you have to continue to live and not let the threat of terrorism prevent you from exercising your freedoms because then the terrorists win anyway.
[01:16:46.642 --> 01:16:49.865]  So this is not a
[01:16:50.603 --> 01:16:56.105]  Good situation when you hear these alerts, and it does create some anxiety and concern.
[01:16:56.325 --> 01:16:59.206]  On the other hand, we have to go on, and that's what Americans will do.
[01:16:59.266 --> 01:17:04.188]  We'll continue to do what we have to do and, you know, fight for our freedom.
[01:17:05.669 --> 01:17:06.309]  Absolutely.
[01:17:06.389 --> 01:17:09.330]  Okay, well, thank you for coming on, Mr. Siegel.
[01:17:09.630 --> 01:17:12.071]  Is there any way to support Officer de la Cruz?
[01:17:12.731 --> 01:17:18.654]  Well, I think that, you know, letters for him, people have been sending letters.
[01:17:18.674 --> 01:17:19.394]  I give it to him.
[01:17:20.612 --> 01:17:41.917]  That's very helpful, and I think that those words and prayers are very important to him, and we'll be back in court on Thursday, and then we'll wait to see, and we're hoping that this judge will recommend no additional punishment because, as I said from the beginning of the interview, the 30 days that he's already been suspended without pay is more than adequate.
[01:17:42.217 --> 01:17:43.397]  There should be no more punishment.
[01:17:44.557 --> 01:17:47.778]  Well, I think the officers that did this setup should be punished.
[01:17:49.190 --> 01:17:57.273]  Well, right now we're focusing on making sure there's no more punishment for Delacruz, and I think that's our goal with regard to this issue.
[01:17:57.313 --> 01:18:14.681]  But it does raise some very fascinating issues, some that you've touched upon, some that we haven't had time to discuss yet, and I think that people all across this country should be thinking about what's the appropriate role for police officers, and especially with regard to the unfortunate, and with regard to homelessness in America.
[01:18:14.721 --> 01:18:15.061]  It's still...
[01:18:16.061 --> 01:18:23.563]  All right.
[01:18:23.803 --> 01:18:27.364]  Well, thanks for joining us.
[01:18:27.584 --> 01:18:27.924]  Pleasure.
[01:18:28.104 --> 01:18:28.384]  Bye-bye.
[01:18:28.584 --> 01:18:28.984]  Take care.
[01:18:29.004 --> 01:18:35.906]  I mean, clearly, I'd say about half the homeless are complete drug addicts and want to be homeless and want to be out there, but some of them aren't.
[01:18:37.086 --> 01:18:40.467]  And what we let the government do to these people could end up happening to us.
[01:18:40.487 --> 01:18:43.928]  All right, we'll get into the big national and international issues.
[01:18:43.948 --> 01:18:44.788]  Your call's first.
[01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:48.597]  When we get back, more on the latest terror alerts.
[01:18:49.419 --> 01:18:49.880]  Stay with us.
[01:18:51.843 --> 01:18:55.344]  If the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:19:18.693 --> 01:19:19.854]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:47.759 --> 01:19:48.259]  We're good to go.
[01:20:14.378 --> 01:20:20.823]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:22.864]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:20:23.064 --> 01:20:29.088]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:20:29.348 --> 01:20:35.012]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[01:20:35.332 --> 01:20:39.195]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-

[01:20:51.782 --> 01:20:54.263]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:54.983 --> 01:21:00.205]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[01:21:01.066 --> 01:21:07.889]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[01:21:08.899 --> 01:21:09.439]  1-800-516-8736 That's 1-800-516-8736
[01:21:38.813 --> 01:21:39.414]  516-8736.
[01:21:41.436 --> 01:21:42.998]  Call now.

[01:21:53.092 --> 01:21:58.555]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:21:58.996 --> 01:22:03.218]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:22:03.458 --> 01:22:10.482]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:22:10.883 --> 01:22:16.946]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:22:17.126 --> 01:22:18.327]  There are no side effects.
[01:22:18.667 --> 01:22:20.707]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free, 866-885-4255.
[01:22:40.814 --> 01:22:41.776]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:22:41.816 --> 01:22:42.397]  Call today.
[01:23:08.371 --> 01:23:10.132]  Hey, Alex, I have four points to bring up.
[01:23:10.152 --> 01:23:15.156]  Do you want to hear them all and respond to them, or do you want to...
[01:23:38.266 --> 01:23:39.467]  Excuse me, respond in turn.
[01:23:39.687 --> 01:23:47.213]  Go ahead, just... Okay, first, what is your opinion of the United States granting titles of nobility, which is a clear violation of the Constitution?
[01:23:48.474 --> 01:23:51.817]  Well, I know that, you know, the U.N.
[01:23:51.877 --> 01:23:56.301]  calls people their excellency, and... Well, you mentioned drug czar earlier.
[01:23:56.321 --> 01:23:58.142]  Most people don't know what a czar is.
[01:23:58.562 --> 01:23:59.443]  It means a king.
[01:23:59.803 --> 01:24:03.186]  An autocratic ruler, or a king who answers to no one, right?
[01:24:03.366 --> 01:24:06.469]  That's right, and... But we have people...
[01:24:07.293 --> 01:24:11.896]  Bush Sr., Colin Powell, all these people getting knighted by the Queen of England.
[01:24:12.297 --> 01:24:16.620]  Well, that's legal if it's authorized by Congress.
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.722]  Well, Congress can say anything's legal.
[01:24:19.782 --> 01:24:21.003]  It's still unconstitutional.
[01:24:21.083 --> 01:24:25.626]  No, in the Constitution it says that they can't accept it unless the Congress agrees.
[01:24:26.227 --> 01:24:33.452]  It says they accept of any present emulation of any kind from any king or foreign state without the consent of Congress.
[01:24:34.934 --> 01:24:35.834]  They can accept that.
[01:24:36.034 --> 01:24:38.075]  Yeah, but Congress doesn't even rubber stamp it.
[01:24:38.095 --> 01:24:38.775]  They just do it.
[01:24:39.275 --> 01:24:39.435]  Right.
[01:24:40.476 --> 01:24:42.736]  The consent of Congress, it would be constitutional.
[01:24:42.776 --> 01:24:43.976]  Okay, go ahead, sir.
[01:24:45.837 --> 01:25:02.141]  But, you know, czar is the Russian equivalent of Caesar, which is similar to... Okay, my second point I had was, I keep hearing about this federal sales tax, and most sales taxes are unconstitutional, as would be a federal sales tax.
[01:25:04.864 --> 01:25:07.007]  Okay.
[01:25:07.067 --> 01:25:09.029]  That's quoted in Article 1, Section 9, Clause 5.
[01:25:09.269 --> 01:25:11.452]  It might want to read the Constitution.
[01:25:11.492 --> 01:25:16.438]  Third of all, did you know that a capitalist society is unconstitutional, as is the money we use right now?
[01:25:17.304 --> 01:25:26.032]  Well, certainly, it's to be not these debtor's notes, a note on a debt that we promised to pay, but gold or silver.
[01:25:26.673 --> 01:25:28.255]  And now they've gotten us into the paper.
[01:25:28.315 --> 01:25:29.576]  Now they're going to get rid of the paper.
[01:25:30.136 --> 01:25:35.482]  And going back to the new national sales tax, they're going to have that running alongside the income tax.
[01:25:36.243 --> 01:25:45.805]  And they've got a lot of so-called conservative groups out promoting it, and the big problem is it will bring federal control into every business, every shop, every website.
[01:25:45.885 --> 01:25:47.186]  Anything that sells anything, right.
[01:25:47.826 --> 01:26:03.210]  Total control, and it's going to take the national ID card because they're going to say, oh, we can't charge the poor people sales tax, but to make sure there's no fraud, you've got to swipe your card to show us what graduated sales tax bracket you're in.
[01:26:06.593 --> 01:26:08.014]  Okay, thanks for the call, sir.
[01:26:09.015 --> 01:26:11.977]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kevin in Boston.
[01:26:12.017 --> 01:26:12.718]  Kevin, go ahead.
[01:26:12.738 --> 01:26:14.299]  Hi, Alex.
[01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:14.880]  Yes.
[01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:16.021]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:26:16.041 --> 01:26:17.061]  I'm going to talk to you.
[01:26:17.102 --> 01:26:17.462]  Go ahead.
[01:26:17.762 --> 01:26:22.586]  I had a couple of quick things I was hoping to get your take on or reaction to.
[01:26:24.467 --> 01:26:34.896]  Coke and Dagger, which is Sherm Skolnik, Lenny Bloom, and their article was picked up by Henry Makow and by Rent, is reporting regarding the Brownsville, Texas,
[01:26:35.669 --> 01:26:58.755]  Metamoros region murders back in 1984, that Bush was a suspect and a member of the cult related to those satanic ritual murders, that the one that was convicted that survived, that was convicted of those murders, a Satanist named Lucas, was on death row and was the only one that Bush decided to issue a pardon to.
[01:26:59.496 --> 01:27:04.357]  And I was wondering if, you know, being from Texas, whether you had some more information or memories of when those
[01:27:04.901 --> 01:27:08.582]  Well, I was aware of that, and it was big news here.
[01:27:08.602 --> 01:27:30.607]  They dug up, I think it was like over a dozen bodies, and they found later a bunch of other... They're finding bodies all the time, and they would torture people to death, and it was a satanic cult down on the Texas border in Matamoros by Boquillas, and I've been down there, and it's...
[01:27:31.934 --> 01:27:35.197]  It's incredible, and it really did go on.
[01:27:36.658 --> 01:27:44.965]  According to the article, though, they're saying that Mr. W., the resident of the White House, his teeth marks were found in one of the victims.
[01:27:45.025 --> 01:27:46.126]  He was a member of the cult.
[01:27:46.166 --> 01:27:47.628]  He went missing for three days.
[01:27:48.208 --> 01:27:54.974]  When a reporter tried to confront him with this stuff, he said, I won't stoop to discussing that.
[01:27:55.493 --> 01:28:04.461]  And we've got people across the country without health care, broken education system, taxes that are way too high, and you want to talk about something that may or may have not happened 16 years ago.
[01:28:04.501 --> 01:28:05.882]  I'm sorry I find that offensive.
[01:28:06.162 --> 01:28:07.683]  He didn't deny it.
[01:28:09.065 --> 01:28:14.429]  No, I've seen the report, and Bush is a member of Skull and Bones, where they do simulated murders.
[01:28:14.469 --> 01:28:17.091]  He's a member of Bohemian Grove, where they do simulated murders.
[01:28:17.371 --> 01:28:17.992]  This is admitted.
[01:28:18.753 --> 01:28:19.513]  And I don't know.
[01:28:19.533 --> 01:28:22.596]  I know the Bushes are involved in narcotics trafficking.
[01:28:23.414 --> 01:28:33.959]  I know the family's involved with the Mexican Mafia, and I know the Mexican Mafia sacrificed, cut people's hearts out en masse, down there on the border, and it's a true story.
[01:28:34.259 --> 01:28:35.380]  I don't know if Bush is involved.
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:35.920]  What do you think?
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:39.742]  I think he may be, based on the film that you showed of what they do.
[01:28:40.042 --> 01:28:40.822]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:28:41.843 --> 01:28:42.743]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.243 --> 01:28:44.844]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:45.765 --> 01:28:48.446]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.443 --> 01:28:54.805]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:28:55.045 --> 01:28:58.888]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:28:59.208 --> 01:29:00.029]  Read the labels.
[01:29:00.469 --> 01:29:04.572]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:29:04.813 --> 01:29:08.996]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:29:09.376 --> 01:29:14.240]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:18.201]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:29:18.401 --> 01:29:23.743]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:29:24.003 --> 01:29:26.743]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:29:27.044 --> 01:29:27.944]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:29:28.244 --> 01:29:33.986]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[01:29:41.809 --> 01:29:44.212]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:29:55.083 --> 01:30:00.007]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:00.267 --> 01:30:04.631]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:04.911 --> 01:30:13.838]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:14.039 --> 01:30:17.682]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:17.962 --> 01:30:22.966]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:23.266 --> 01:30:30.008]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:30.489 --> 01:30:31.149]  What about you?
[01:30:31.789 --> 01:30:37.131]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:30:51.713 --> 01:30:53.994]  My family is breathing easier, and now you can too.
[01:30:54.194 --> 01:30:57.556]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the Biozone Air Purifier.
[01:30:57.636 --> 01:30:59.857]  The Biozone Air Purifier is not a filter system.
[01:31:00.017 --> 01:31:05.940]  It works at the molecular level, binding the small bits of dust, allergens, and other particles in your air into clumps that are too heavy to float.
[01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:08.761]  They fall harmlessly to the floor to be literally swept away.
[01:31:09.021 --> 01:31:09.702]  Nothing escapes.
[01:31:09.822 --> 01:31:14.044]  The Biozone Air Purifier also kills virus and bacteria germs and totally removes odors.
[01:31:14.224 --> 01:31:17.826]  Out on the farm, we have several cats and two big dogs, so pet odors can be a concern.
[01:31:17.946 --> 01:31:20.187]  But like the odors from anything else, simply gone.
[01:31:20.447 --> 01:31:20.747]  Smoke?
[01:31:20.987 --> 01:31:22.829]  My wife and I don't, but several of our friends do.
[01:31:23.029 --> 01:31:26.091]  Our Biozone Air Purifier clears out that smoke literally within minutes.
[01:31:26.292 --> 01:31:30.415]  I use it myself, and I'm telling you, your Biozone Air Purifier will improve the air in your home.
[01:31:30.575 --> 01:31:33.217]  It even comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee and free shipping.

[01:31:53.727 --> 01:31:58.850]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:31:59.550 --> 01:32:01.891]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:10.675 --> 01:32:20.900]  Yes, back in the late 1980s, there were discoveries of satanic Mexican drug dealer cults.
[01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:22.241]  I mean, people that were bringing in
[01:32:23.188 --> 01:32:30.954]  Thousands of kilos of cocaine in southern New Mexico, over the Mexican border, in south Texas.
[01:32:34.116 --> 01:32:44.663]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of women have come up missing out of some of the cities on the southern border.
[01:32:44.804 --> 01:32:52.369]  El Paso, every year or so, they dig up a bunch of new dead bodies in the sand with their hearts and guts cut out.
[01:32:53.362 --> 01:32:55.844]  And then it's usually a very small news article.
[01:32:56.344 --> 01:32:57.825]  Most Americans aren't even aware of this.
[01:32:57.845 --> 01:33:00.086]  You'd think they'd make a couple made-for-TV movies about it.
[01:33:00.106 --> 01:33:03.868]  I think I heard they were, though, about a year ago.
[01:33:03.888 --> 01:33:05.089]  I heard some rumblings of that.
[01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:13.374]  And I've read about Bush pardoning one of the people from the death penalty.
[01:33:14.135 --> 01:33:14.555]  I don't know.
[01:33:14.735 --> 01:33:15.796]  I don't know what to believe.
[01:33:16.556 --> 01:33:22.960]  Look, I know that anybody that's doing satanic rituals at Skull and Bones or Bohemian Grove should be investigated, period.
[01:33:24.884 --> 01:33:27.026]  But again, this is so bizarre, so crazy.
[01:33:27.086 --> 01:33:30.589]  I mean, how do you even... I have trouble getting my mind around it.
[01:33:31.290 --> 01:33:33.832]  But Kevin in Boston, go ahead and finish up your comments.
[01:33:34.152 --> 01:33:50.126]  Well, you know, General Manuel Noriega was a participant, we know, with Carlos Slater's drug trafficking, and they made a big thing when they took him out, when the soldiers went in and took him out, and how they found all sorts of satanic ritual stuff in his residence.
[01:33:50.366 --> 01:33:51.367]  I remember that, yeah.
[01:33:51.909 --> 01:33:54.590]  And also, Mr. Carey is no different.
[01:33:54.610 --> 01:34:18.057]  He's a Skull and Bones member, and they're reporting some serious, you know, indiscretions on his part that are shocking, unbelievable, but when you realize that they're part of satanic abuse in Skull and Bones, he's allegedly, according to Skolnick and Bloom, involved in kiddie, you know, like pedophilia, not film, which are, I don't mean to shock people, but it's where...
[01:34:18.627 --> 01:34:21.448]  After the abuse, they kill the people, and they film this.
[01:34:21.628 --> 01:34:24.469]  It's part of their, you know, offering to Satan.
[01:34:26.709 --> 01:34:27.329]  It's shocking.
[01:34:27.469 --> 01:34:29.570]  I don't know whether to believe it or not, but this is out there.
[01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:41.173]  Well, we know that it goes on, and we know that Noriega, they did find a bunch of weird satanic stuff, and we know that... Why are they all obsessed with this?
[01:34:41.393 --> 01:34:42.934]  I mean, we know they're into the occult.
[01:34:43.734 --> 01:34:45.394]  The question is, how far does it go?
[01:34:45.474 --> 01:34:47.675]  And we know that on the southern border...
[01:34:49.407 --> 01:34:55.068]  There are all these bizarre mass graves that have been found from satanic rituals.
[01:34:55.909 --> 01:34:59.009]  Well, I believe that being a Christian, I believe Satan's real.
[01:34:59.089 --> 01:35:00.830]  They're in the seats of power.
[01:35:01.010 --> 01:35:05.831]  Perhaps they have been rewarded for this filth and immoral behavior.
[01:35:06.371 --> 01:35:17.454]  The other point I want to get your take on before leaving is Howard Dean's been on TV, local TV around here, I don't know if he's getting any major coverage, stating his feeling that these terror attacks are nothing but politics, which we all know, but for
[01:35:17.881 --> 01:35:23.162]  Somebody in the mainstream, they get some press coverage where we're somewhat censored.
[01:35:23.202 --> 01:35:24.022]  Well, a lot of people.
[01:35:24.082 --> 01:35:33.864]  I mean, there's been FBI and CIA folks that have gone public and said, we were ordered to issue fake terror alerts for political favor, for political support.
[01:35:34.824 --> 01:35:41.465]  We have had the White House press secretary, before he left, Ari Fleischer, got up and admitted it, which was bizarre.
[01:35:42.446 --> 01:35:43.826]  So we know they're doing this.
[01:35:44.682 --> 01:35:47.283]  And then people say, well, then how do you know when a real attack's coming?
[01:35:47.323 --> 01:35:49.144]  Well, when the globalists decide to carry one out.
[01:35:49.204 --> 01:35:49.624]  That's how.
[01:35:49.924 --> 01:35:50.705]  Thanks for the call, Kevin.
[01:35:50.725 --> 01:35:50.965]  Thank you.
[01:35:52.245 --> 01:35:53.366]  Jackie in Colorado.
[01:35:53.746 --> 01:35:54.726]  Jackie, thanks for holding.
[01:35:54.746 --> 01:35:55.107]  Go ahead.
[01:35:55.387 --> 01:35:55.927]  Yeah, I'm here.
[01:35:56.487 --> 01:35:58.948]  Yeah, I decided to put it in one sentence.
[01:36:00.349 --> 01:36:00.989]  Make it easy.
[01:36:01.729 --> 01:36:05.791]  Why pilots shouldn't have pistols or, you know, firearms.
[01:36:06.251 --> 01:36:10.053]  If pilots had a pocket pistol, they might be able to knock out
[01:36:11.792 --> 01:36:15.715]  An autopilot accidentally, for some strange reason, cut in.
[01:36:17.116 --> 01:36:27.624]  I guess they'd have to know where to aim and have the right load in their pistol to knock it out before the G-Force knocked them out.
[01:36:28.345 --> 01:36:36.811]  You say that the way they did it is make the airplane do some weird thing to knock out all the people?
[01:36:38.519 --> 01:36:40.380]  Okay, I'm trying to understand what you're saying, sir.
[01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:44.303]  Oh, okay, well, you want me to do it one sentence at a time?
[01:36:45.584 --> 01:36:50.267]  Well, no, I mean, you're saying you don't believe that airline pilots should be armed.
[01:36:50.487 --> 01:36:51.888]  No, that's what I said.
[01:36:52.088 --> 01:37:00.714]  That's the reason why the real terrorists don't want them to have guns, because they might be able to knock out the autopilot if they knew where to shoot it.
[01:37:01.625 --> 01:37:12.415]  Oh, so you're saying why the government doesn't want to arm the pilots is because they could damage the plane when it's under remote control.
[01:37:12.455 --> 01:37:15.878]  They could knock out the autopilot and then regain control, right.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:17.840]  Oh, no, that's a good point.
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:18.921]  I understand what you're saying now.
[01:37:18.961 --> 01:37:19.461]  Yes, sir.
[01:37:19.481 --> 01:37:23.443]  Yeah, well, I mean, I had to get this cherry out before the secret police come around and get me.
[01:37:24.544 --> 01:37:26.524]  Well, they don't have that many secret police yet.
[01:37:26.565 --> 01:37:32.927]  They've got to promote it and get us to accept it and set up the domestic CIA and get us all trained to accept it.
[01:37:33.288 --> 01:37:35.289]  That's all down the line, my friend, but thanks for the call.
[01:37:36.089 --> 01:37:38.950]  That's what we're trying to stop, sir.
[01:37:39.771 --> 01:37:42.452]  Let me tell you the real reason they don't want to arm the pilots.
[01:37:45.333 --> 01:37:46.514]  Why does George Bush...
[01:37:47.873 --> 01:37:54.257]  Why did he promise a veto if Congress passed a law allowing the arming of the pilots?
[01:37:55.638 --> 01:37:58.539]  And you go, wait a minute, they did pass a law saying you can arm the pilots.
[01:37:58.579 --> 01:37:59.940]  Well, no, they really didn't do that.
[01:38:01.641 --> 01:38:05.964]  What they did was, is Bush came out and said, I'm against arming any of them, I'll veto it.
[01:38:05.984 --> 01:38:16.830]  There was a giant, conservative, grassroots reaction, and so the White House said, okay, we'll have a pilot program, no pun intended, to...
[01:38:17.808 --> 01:38:22.731]  Train strenuously 2% of the pilots.
[01:38:24.272 --> 01:38:29.856]  And then we will study that and in a couple years look at it and decide what we're going to do.
[01:38:32.358 --> 01:38:38.422]  And of the 2%, very few of those ever got armed because there were so many hoops you had to jump through.
[01:38:38.502 --> 01:38:45.787]  Multi-month course with the FBI and become an air marshal, basically a deputy air marshal and go through all this.
[01:38:47.654 --> 01:39:03.723]  These are men and women, mainly men, who were most of them fighter pilots or cargo pilots for years, for decades, before they get behind the cockpit of a 747 or whatever the case may be.
[01:39:05.624 --> 01:39:13.048]  With hundreds of switches and dials, and they could throw the stick and have so many G-forces they could break people's necks.
[01:39:13.755 --> 01:39:18.697]  They could fly the plane into a building, but oh, we cannot trust a pilot to be armed.
[01:39:19.697 --> 01:39:21.178]  And they said, oh, well, what about accidents?
[01:39:21.198 --> 01:39:26.760]  Well, they were going to put instant access pistol safes in the cockpits.
[01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:29.681]  This is what the pilots wanted to do, the pilots' union.
[01:39:30.801 --> 01:39:33.422]  And so in about two seconds, they could get to that firearm.
[01:39:33.482 --> 01:39:35.203]  Somebody starts trying to ram down the door.
[01:39:36.027 --> 01:39:37.308]  They just get the gun and shoot them.
[01:39:37.328 --> 01:39:39.170]  And you say, well, what about guns?
[01:39:39.310 --> 01:39:40.651]  Guns would depressurize.
[01:39:41.011 --> 01:39:42.753]  Well, why do the air marshals have guns?
[01:39:43.453 --> 01:39:51.099]  They have a special type of safety slug that dissipates its energies on impact so it will not shoot through the aircraft.
[01:39:51.179 --> 01:39:55.623]  And even if you did shoot through the aircraft, folks, you don't instantly lose pressure.
[01:39:57.104 --> 01:39:58.305]  It's a slow process.
[01:39:58.325 --> 01:40:03.990]  You could open up with a machine gun in a plane and it would slowly lose pressure.
[01:40:04.804 --> 01:40:19.996]  So they had all these lies and all these reasons, but the real reason was they don't want to send the message that arming yourself is good, that citizens, individuals having guns is the answer to the threat of terrorism.
[01:40:20.757 --> 01:40:28.203]  They want to say, oh no, it's men in black uniforms, in black ski masks, with submachine guns and armored vehicles.
[01:40:28.823 --> 01:40:30.304]  That's the answer to terrorism.
[01:40:30.405 --> 01:40:31.625]  Cameras on the street corners.
[01:40:32.086 --> 01:40:33.407]  That's the answer to terrorism.
[01:40:34.167 --> 01:40:35.488]  And then I said, you watch.
[01:40:35.928 --> 01:40:43.051]  Then there's going to be attacks on buses and railways and the roads or threats to them.
[01:40:43.491 --> 01:40:48.853]  Oh, now we're going to have to have troops at the bridges and the roads and the buses and the trains.
[01:40:49.553 --> 01:40:50.674]  Now that's happening.
[01:40:51.654 --> 01:40:53.875]  The answer is don't arm the train conductor.
[01:40:54.575 --> 01:40:57.957]  The answer is don't let the people have the Second Amendment again.
[01:40:58.542 --> 01:41:00.664]  So no criminal would dare go on a train.
[01:41:01.044 --> 01:41:06.668]  The answer is we're going to disarm you, and then the people who are really the terrorists are going to run your lives for you.
[01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:10.650]  And so that's what's happening.
[01:41:10.710 --> 01:41:12.312]  That's why they don't want to arm the pilots.
[01:41:12.772 --> 01:41:15.474]  And notice now we have the, quote, compromise.
[01:41:15.714 --> 01:41:18.536]  Let's allow 2% if they elect to, to be armed.
[01:41:18.576 --> 01:41:20.197]  It's ridiculous.
[01:41:20.217 --> 01:41:21.198]  It's ridiculous.
[01:41:25.757 --> 01:41:29.838]  By the way, up until a month before 9-11, World Net Daily actually had this report.
[01:41:30.819 --> 01:41:37.541]  Cargo planes, mail-carrying planes, by law, had to have a gun.
[01:41:37.561 --> 01:41:42.583]  I wasn't aware of that until I learned that, but strangely enough, the law wasn't followed and most didn't have guns.
[01:41:44.023 --> 01:41:46.524]  So why don't we have guns in the cockpit?
[01:41:46.564 --> 01:41:47.224]  It's ridiculous.
[01:41:48.064 --> 01:41:50.025]  There need to be guns in the cockpit.
[01:41:50.655 --> 01:42:16.709]  But again, then if they ever want to pull the remote control hijacking again, where the globalists put the nerve gas in the plane, kill everybody on board, then fly it into the buildings, put out a few fake cell phone conversations, which, by the way, your cell phones don't work on board the planes, but magically they did that day, and magically passports fell out of the sky, unburned, and everything else was destroyed and fell into the government's hands of the hijackers.
[01:42:17.530 --> 01:42:18.210]  They can't have...
[01:42:19.223 --> 01:42:34.830]  And now Bush wants to create a new intelligence director.
[01:42:36.130 --> 01:42:37.151]  I mean, that's absurd.
[01:42:37.431 --> 01:42:38.111]  Enough already.
[01:42:38.411 --> 01:42:44.233]  We already got 15 agencies and hundreds of millions of dollars, and we can't get it right, and now they want to create another one?
[01:42:44.514 --> 01:42:45.294]  Well, that's right.
[01:42:45.354 --> 01:42:46.835]  You've got your math correct.
[01:42:46.855 --> 01:42:47.075]  There are 15...
[01:42:48.710 --> 01:43:10.542]  Intelligence security agencies that we know of, and now we're going to have not just the CIA getting domestic powers, but a mega office headed by a director of CIA, Director of Central Intelligence, Director of CIA, who is going to have his funding outside Congress.
[01:43:11.411 --> 01:43:25.839]  A direct funding mechanism, so shadow government out in the open, running our lives, and they're recruiting the truck drivers, the cable people, the exterminators, to fight terrorism and crime and crime and crime.
[01:43:25.879 --> 01:43:32.903]  Alex, they told us after 9-11 that they needed to create the Department of Homeland Security with Tom Ritz to do this very thing.
[01:43:33.516 --> 01:43:36.018]  And now they're coming back and saying, we need more government.
[01:43:36.038 --> 01:43:37.078]  We still can't get it right.
[01:43:37.098 --> 01:43:38.999]  We need more government.
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:40.880]  Did you watch Chairman Keene?
[01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:42.962]  He said, and this isn't going to keep us safe.
[01:43:43.082 --> 01:43:44.583]  It's more, more, more.
[01:43:44.983 --> 01:43:47.825]  And the attacks are just going to get worse, though.
[01:43:48.285 --> 01:43:57.470]  Gary and Bush are both behind, both backing this, just like they do with civil unions and the assault weapons bans and open borders and free trade and on and on ad nauseum.
[01:44:00.232 --> 01:44:00.752]  You tell them.
[01:44:00.813 --> 01:44:01.093]  Go.
[01:44:01.253 --> 01:44:01.533]  Tell them.
[01:44:02.764 --> 01:44:05.325]  Congress just needs to say, no, we don't need enough of this.
[01:44:05.365 --> 01:44:08.807]  We need to start closing down agencies and repealing laws.
[01:44:08.847 --> 01:44:09.927]  We don't need more government.
[01:44:09.947 --> 01:44:10.528]  We need less.
[01:44:13.969 --> 01:44:15.530]  I heartily agree with you, my dear.
[01:44:17.911 --> 01:44:20.012]  Well, that's all I've got to say with my rant.
[01:44:20.472 --> 01:44:21.432]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:44:21.993 --> 01:44:24.774]  The only solution that these people have is more and more government.
[01:44:25.574 --> 01:44:27.295]  That's the only response they can come up with.
[01:44:28.138 --> 01:44:30.119]  Well, we've got enough government now.
[01:44:30.179 --> 01:44:31.460]  We can't get it right.
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:38.403]  Aggressive, police state, classical Soviet-slash-Nazi-style government.
[01:44:40.103 --> 01:44:40.624]  Absolutely.
[01:44:40.664 --> 01:44:41.344]  Thanks for the call.
[01:44:41.544 --> 01:44:43.465]  Give us your liberties, giant government.
[01:44:46.586 --> 01:44:48.367]  I totally agree with you, Randy.
[01:44:49.808 --> 01:44:53.269]  By the way, if you read the 9-11 Whitewash Commission, it's online.
[01:44:53.369 --> 01:44:55.210]  Please don't waste your money buying a copy.
[01:44:56.613 --> 01:44:59.055]  I can't believe they're making money off this with a private publisher.
[01:44:59.395 --> 01:45:00.176]  It's just so sick.
[01:45:00.556 --> 01:45:07.862]  The people, intimately, some of them involved in 9-11, others intimately involved in covering it up, and then they're going to sell it.
[01:45:08.542 --> 01:45:09.963]  But they've got it online.
[01:45:10.003 --> 01:45:13.907]  But if you go read the report, it blames Congress.
[01:45:15.268 --> 01:45:16.789]  The FBI made a mistake.
[01:45:16.809 --> 01:45:18.110]  The CIA dropped the ball.
[01:45:18.170 --> 01:45:18.990]  But it's okay.
[01:45:19.011 --> 01:45:20.191]  Let's double their funding.
[01:45:20.231 --> 01:45:20.932]  They doubled it in 2002 and won.
[01:45:22.944 --> 01:45:27.266]  Now they want to double the funding again with a new giant agency.
[01:45:29.746 --> 01:45:33.768]  And in the report, though, the strongest criticism isn't for Clinton or Bush.
[01:45:33.868 --> 01:45:34.628]  They're absolved.
[01:45:34.788 --> 01:45:36.189]  They did nothing.
[01:45:36.449 --> 01:45:37.089]  They're wonderful.
[01:45:37.129 --> 01:45:37.589]  They're good.
[01:45:38.249 --> 01:45:44.972]  No, it's all Congress's fault because they didn't see the threat to appropriate money beforehand.
[01:45:45.592 --> 01:45:50.774]  So, see, Congress is being told, you're bad, you've got to capitulate and advocate.
[01:45:52.975 --> 01:45:56.516]  The total takeover of Congress.
[01:45:56.916 --> 01:46:06.498]  See, Congress gives away its trade authority, gives away its border authority, gives away its funding for intelligence, its funding for the military.
[01:46:08.238 --> 01:46:10.798]  Bush doesn't even have to get Congress to declare war anymore.
[01:46:12.799 --> 01:46:14.459]  It's called dictatorship, folks.
[01:46:14.519 --> 01:46:15.699]  It's textbook.
[01:46:15.759 --> 01:46:17.360]  It's happening right in front of us.
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:19.880]  And so the report
[01:46:21.528 --> 01:46:24.649]  Spanks the Congress and says they better follow our recommendations.
[01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:26.089]  And Kerry goes, absolutely.
[01:46:26.129 --> 01:46:27.369]  And Bush goes, absolutely.
[01:46:27.569 --> 01:46:28.049]  I agree.
[01:46:28.069 --> 01:46:32.470]  And the media goes, this is a shocking development.
[01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:36.171]  We've never seen gridlock disappear like this.
[01:46:36.211 --> 01:46:40.571]  We're about to have a domestic CIA that's going to fight terror and crime.
[01:46:41.531 --> 01:46:41.832]  And why?
[01:46:41.872 --> 01:46:45.512]  We're going to have CIA offices in all major cities over the police department.
[01:46:45.552 --> 01:46:48.633]  And we're going to move the police department into the National Guard Armory.
[01:46:48.733 --> 01:46:49.953]  Oh, already happening covertly.
[01:46:50.555 --> 01:46:53.556]  And we're going to merge it all, and boy, this is going to be great!
[01:46:53.956 --> 01:46:56.237]  That way they can have all their ducks in a row.
[01:46:56.277 --> 01:47:01.539]  That way they can carry out all their drug dealing and their terrorism and everything else they do.
[01:47:03.700 --> 01:47:04.921]  Absolutely, caller.
[01:47:05.461 --> 01:47:06.141]  We're going to go to break.
[01:47:06.161 --> 01:47:07.482]  We'll come back and get into some more news.
[01:47:07.522 --> 01:47:09.803]  We'll go to Eric in Tennessee and others.
[01:47:09.843 --> 01:47:11.643]  Toll-free number to join us on air.
[01:47:11.663 --> 01:47:15.485]  If you disagree with me, if you agree with me, if you've got some pertinent issue...
[01:47:16.744 --> 01:47:17.284]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:47:17.304 --> 01:47:18.105]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:47:19.525 --> 01:47:32.689]  The last minute or two here before we break, though, I sure hope all of you will go visit prisonplanet.tv.
[01:47:33.889 --> 01:47:36.950]  And I want to thank those that have signed up at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:47:37.590 --> 01:47:42.912]  I have four websites, and the bandwidth is pretty expensive, and we still offer a lot of video and audio and
[01:47:44.188 --> 01:47:47.931]  Text reports and stuff for free, but it's a catch-22.
[01:47:48.091 --> 01:47:51.413]  Either we start charging for something, or I can't do it.
[01:47:51.473 --> 01:47:52.074]  I can't afford it.
[01:47:52.674 --> 01:48:11.467]  So you get exclusive, privileged, VIP, whatever you want to call it, access to my sometimes twice-a-week video reports, hour-long, every week an hour report, all my films, other great films we've been authorized to post, my book, Paul Watson's book,
[01:48:13.543 --> 01:48:16.624]  Just the best radio interviews we do.
[01:48:17.485 --> 01:48:21.666]  It's all posted at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:48:23.327 --> 01:48:31.910]  And I want to encourage everybody to go sign up at prisonplanet.tv today to not procrastinate, to not wait, to take action.
[01:48:33.171 --> 01:48:38.093]  Also, I have, again, made ten films, America Destroyed by Design,
[01:48:38.954 --> 01:48:54.280]  America, Wake Up or Waco, Police State 2000, Police State 2, The Takeover, Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports Exposed, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Matrix of Evil, Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[01:48:54.780 --> 01:49:01.143]  These are all over two hours long, incredible videos that will wake people up in a big way.
[01:49:02.071 --> 01:49:08.236]  So again, I ask you to get the films, to make copies of my videos, to put them on AXS TV, to get them out to people.
[01:49:08.536 --> 01:49:15.442]  We exposed this whole New World Order takeover, the militarized takeover, and how they would use terrorism, the threat of terrorism, to do it.
[01:49:16.022 --> 01:49:18.124]  I figured this out back in 98, folks.
[01:49:19.325 --> 01:49:20.246]  It's not hard to figure out.
[01:49:20.266 --> 01:49:21.467]  The game plan's out in the open.
[01:49:22.027 --> 01:49:22.848]  Get the videos.
[01:49:22.948 --> 01:49:23.868]  Get them out to people.
[01:49:23.888 --> 01:49:23.949]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:49:31.258 --> 01:49:41.366]  Again, that's 888-253-3139 or InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order via the safe, secure shopping cart.
[01:49:41.886 --> 01:49:42.987]  Please don't wait.
[01:49:43.087 --> 01:49:43.688]  Take action.
[01:49:43.708 --> 01:49:43.748]  888-253-3139.
[01:49:43.768 --> 01:49:44.869]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:44.889 --> 01:49:45.669]  Stay with us.
[01:49:51.809 --> 01:49:56.153]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:56.333 --> 01:50:00.737]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:00.917 --> 01:50:05.300]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:50:05.401 --> 01:50:06.682]  A New World Order.
[01:50:08.484 --> 01:50:12.688]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:12.748 --> 01:50:19.696]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:19.836 --> 01:50:21.819]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:22.179 --> 01:50:22.639]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:22.679 --> 01:50:24.000]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:50:51.866 --> 01:50:54.870]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:50:55.210 --> 01:51:04.040]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:09.046]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:09.506 --> 01:51:16.208]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:16.628 --> 01:51:28.392]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:28.872 --> 01:51:33.335]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:51:33.515 --> 01:51:35.977]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:51:40.599 --> 01:51:41.600]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[01:52:59.239 --> 01:53:12.743]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest A gun on my hip and the right to arrest I'm the guy who's a boss on this highway So watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way Welcome back, my friends.
[01:53:12.843 --> 01:53:15.084]  Here's an article out of the Village Voice.
[01:53:16.284 --> 01:53:17.624]  Terror against the press.
[01:53:17.724 --> 01:53:23.466]  The curious saga of the Boston FBI's unconfirmed reports of a right-wing threat to the media.
[01:53:25.402 --> 01:53:40.407]  It looks like the FBI's Boston field office faked a threat of domestic terrorism just before the start of the Democratic National Convention by leaking unconfirmed reports of white supremacist groups readying an attack against media vehicles in Boston.
[01:53:40.467 --> 01:53:47.490]  Fox News, for one, reportedly was wildly trying to disguise its trucks by covering up its logos.
[01:53:49.190 --> 01:53:50.691]  And we told you that was fake, folks.
[01:53:52.293 --> 01:53:58.034]  It's a long article and they detail that, but I mean, I've never seen a case where they don't put out a fake alert.
[01:53:58.094 --> 01:53:59.575]  I mean, consciously just make it up.
[01:54:00.055 --> 01:54:05.816]  But see, that stole all the headlines, turned it into a psychological training event to be a slave.
[01:54:06.056 --> 01:54:07.237]  Oh, look, being a slave's good.
[01:54:07.677 --> 01:54:08.217]  Keeps you safe.
[01:54:08.577 --> 01:54:14.058]  The effects of this probably was to make the press even more suspicious of anti-war demonstrators than it already is.
[01:54:15.219 --> 01:54:21.140]  To even view them as possible terrorists and if not actual terrorists, then a crowd within which terrorists could operate.
[01:54:22.421 --> 01:54:25.403]  Meanwhile, they put protesters inside a cage inside a cage.
[01:54:25.443 --> 01:54:27.045]  Again, sending you that message.
[01:54:27.945 --> 01:54:40.255]  All of this is taking place in an atmosphere of fear and tension whipped up by the Bush administration with its reports of Al-Qaeda sleeping cells preparing to strike against America in the midst of the presidential campaign.
[01:54:42.137 --> 01:54:49.963]  And it says the white supremacists on the far right have never shown any great interest in the war on terror and they usually try to use the press, not attack it.
[01:54:50.808 --> 01:55:12.194]  Mark Potok, editor of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Report, which tracks the far right, told Glenn Wilson of the serious-minded Southerner Daily News blog, We have had no indication whatsoever, not an inkling that there was any kind of violent action planned by the radical right in Boston.
[01:55:12.254 --> 01:55:14.255]  We followed these groups quite closely.
[01:55:16.736 --> 01:55:18.096]  And then it gets into...
[01:55:20.613 --> 01:55:31.120]  The report, CNN reported, authorities fear that some protesters are preparing to target the media and that the Boston Joint Terrorism Task Force is investigating.
[01:55:31.540 --> 01:55:34.902]  ABC News also said basically the same thing.
[01:55:37.304 --> 01:55:39.945]  So this is how they do it, folks, preemptively.
[01:55:40.145 --> 01:55:41.887]  Oh, you can't protest now.
[01:55:41.987 --> 01:55:48.811]  You can't get involved now because we got a credible threat that somebody might do something wrong.
[01:55:49.907 --> 01:55:53.708]  And so because there's a boogeyman floating around out there, you don't have any freedoms.
[01:55:56.208 --> 01:55:57.828]  Oh, the government wouldn't want to do that.
[01:55:57.848 --> 01:56:11.311]  There's a lot of evidence that these bombings taking place in Baghdad are being engaged in by the coalition, what do you call it, kangaroo government.
[01:56:13.051 --> 01:56:14.271]  And they really have the motive.
[01:56:14.291 --> 01:56:17.612]  Destabilization allows the globalists to stay there longer,
[01:56:18.536 --> 01:56:30.466]  To make more money off no-bid contracts, to scare different minority groups into supporting the coalition provisional authority or whatever new name it's got this week.
[01:56:32.047 --> 01:56:37.772]  But again, I don't know who's carrying out these blasts, and they're horrible, and they're real blasts to those that are dead and dying.
[01:56:38.592 --> 01:56:40.794]  Bomb blasts rock Iraqi churches.
[01:56:40.894 --> 01:56:46.959]  Bomb blasts have gone off near four churches in the Iraqi capital, and one in the northern city of Mosul, police say.
[01:56:48.354 --> 01:56:57.619]  At least 11 people were reported dead, and they blew up Catholic churches, Protestant churches, Orthodox churches.
[01:56:57.639 --> 01:56:58.419]  It's just horrible.
[01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:02.581]  And don't worry, though.
[01:57:02.641 --> 01:57:03.261]  Never fear.
[01:57:03.301 --> 01:57:06.683]  The government's putting up cameras all over the place to track and trace the public.
[01:57:06.723 --> 01:57:08.664]  See, that equals safety.
[01:57:10.425 --> 01:57:14.547]  That equals liberation, as if cameras are going to stop any of this.
[01:57:16.761 --> 01:57:18.482]  The Total Surveillance Society.
[01:57:18.502 --> 01:57:21.243]  We've got to destroy freedom to protect it.
[01:57:22.404 --> 01:57:23.704]  All right, the third hour is coming up.
[01:57:23.724 --> 01:57:28.006]  We'll go to Eric and Mark and Tim and Raymond and Ann and everybody else that's patiently holding.
[01:57:29.407 --> 01:57:39.652]  And I really do hope that all of you will visit InfoWars.com and check out the books and videos and materials because they're such a vital part of the fight against the New World Order.
[01:57:39.692 --> 01:57:40.272]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:48.973 --> 01:57:49.613]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.294 --> 01:57:51.334]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.055 --> 01:57:53.155]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.816 --> 01:57:54.616]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.396 --> 01:57:56.277]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.297 --> 01:58:00.619]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.139 --> 01:58:05.262]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:11.505 --> 01:58:14.747]  All right, my friends, we're already into hour number three.
[01:58:17.043 --> 01:58:29.351]  Of this Monday edition, the second day of August 2004, we've got the government running around fear-mongering, saying terrorist-specific threats are going to attack us any minute unless we give up all of our freedoms.
[01:58:29.391 --> 01:58:38.097]  We've got people trying to get into a New Mexico amphitheater to hear Dick Cheney give a speech.
[01:58:38.137 --> 01:58:45.082]  They've got to give the background check of their driver's license number and sign a pledge that they support the Republicans to get into the meetings.
[01:58:46.109 --> 01:58:47.610]  So these are our public town halls.
[01:58:47.630 --> 01:58:48.590]  They're totally staged.
[01:58:49.070 --> 01:58:50.411]  Just a bunch of news coming up.
[01:58:50.431 --> 01:58:58.494]  I also want to get into a Professor Chosodosky article about coup d'etat in America by the globalists taking over.
[01:58:58.814 --> 01:59:00.895]  But right now, let's go to the calls as promised.
[01:59:01.035 --> 01:59:02.496]  Eric in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[01:59:02.536 --> 01:59:02.976]  Go ahead.
[01:59:02.996 --> 01:59:04.156]  How are you doing today, Alex?
[01:59:04.176 --> 01:59:04.736]  Good, my friend.
[01:59:05.137 --> 01:59:06.697]  I've got a couple of things to say to you.
[01:59:06.717 --> 01:59:09.238]  You can cut me off when you don't have any more time for me.
[01:59:09.278 --> 01:59:10.959]  I have a couple of things I want to get in.
[01:59:11.319 --> 01:59:13.500]  First of all, two things I saw on CNN today.
[01:59:14.308 --> 01:59:16.429]  The first thing is that you're talking about Iraq.
[01:59:16.829 --> 01:59:17.989]  Well, they've got the U.S.
[01:59:18.029 --> 01:59:19.390]  military stirring up things again.
[01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:23.852]  They're going after that Muqtada outsider again and surrounded his house.
[01:59:24.232 --> 01:59:33.995]  I guess they weren't getting enough activity in Iraq, so they're stirring up the Shiites again to start fighting with our troops again, when everything in that side had calmed down.
[01:59:34.275 --> 01:59:40.938]  The second thing, and I don't know if you keep recorders going to record news that goes on during the day when you're doing your show.
[01:59:41.448 --> 01:59:47.853]  But today, Bush had a news conference, of course, under the cloud of all this terrorist threat in New York.
[01:59:47.953 --> 01:59:50.055]  No, I watched part of it.
[01:59:50.095 --> 01:59:50.876]  I didn't record it.
[01:59:51.316 --> 01:59:51.636]  Okay.
[01:59:51.977 --> 01:59:56.901]  And under the cloud of terrorism, oh, we've got to have a domestic CIA running your life.
[01:59:57.261 --> 02:00:07.249]  Yeah, did you hear him say, now I've got it recorded, he said that he's going to be passing a lot of executive orders and that he is going to reform Congress.
[02:00:08.263 --> 02:00:15.668]  It's Congress's fault because they have all these committees and he has to send Tom Ridge up there all the time to testify and then he can't do his job.
[02:00:15.708 --> 02:00:16.769]  So it's Congress's fault.
[02:00:16.829 --> 02:00:17.810]  No, I did hear that.
[02:00:17.890 --> 02:00:19.311]  Can you cue that up for us?
[02:00:20.192 --> 02:00:21.653]  No, I sure can't.
[02:00:22.133 --> 02:00:23.774]  I could call back in a little bit and cue it up.
[02:00:23.954 --> 02:00:25.035]  Yeah, well, no.
[02:00:25.055 --> 02:00:28.377]  Do that during the break and then we'll go back to you when you've got it cued up.
[02:00:28.417 --> 02:00:29.418]  But I did hear that.
[02:00:29.938 --> 02:00:31.479]  And again, it's Congress's fault.
[02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:33.381]  He's going to reform Congress.
[02:00:33.421 --> 02:00:36.383]  The executive is basically going to take over Congress.
[02:00:36.423 --> 02:00:37.764]  I mean, this is public...
[02:00:38.354 --> 02:00:39.255]  Dictatorship.
[02:00:39.775 --> 02:00:50.981]  And, of course, the dictator to be, perhaps, the anointed, you know, co-coronated Skull and Bones cousin, Carrie just loves it, too.
[02:00:51.602 --> 02:00:58.085]  Well, the thing is, is that, like y'all were talking about earlier, you and a couple of the other callers were talking about this title of czar.
[02:00:58.466 --> 02:01:07.551]  If you don't mind, I was wanting to read from a 1980 version of the Webster Dictionary the definition for a czar is an emperor or king, and then the second part of the definition is
[02:01:08.010 --> 02:01:10.473]  An absolute ruler, a death bot.
[02:01:11.754 --> 02:01:16.318]  Yeah, I know, and the official title is Drug Czar, Anti-Terror Czar.
[02:01:16.599 --> 02:01:20.483]  And now Intelligence Czar, and they said it on the news today, Intelligence Czar.
[02:01:20.863 --> 02:01:27.249]  That's going to be the title of this new guy that they're going to be appointing over the CIA and the FBI.
[02:01:27.350 --> 02:01:31.694]  I know, it's all right out in our face, Czar this, Czar that.
[02:01:33.041 --> 02:01:33.362]  It is.
[02:01:33.482 --> 02:01:38.605]  I mean, this is federalization like the Nazis did to the Germans.
[02:01:39.125 --> 02:01:58.097]  And it is just blowing me away that the majority of American people are just watching this nightmare and accepting like this is the normal, this is status quo, this is the way... Well, the average American really isn't buying it, but they put out the perception so we all feel like we're alone.
[02:01:58.217 --> 02:02:00.599]  But the majority of people I talk to
[02:02:01.389 --> 02:02:06.811]  Old, young, black, white, conservative, liberal, know something is wrong and are very upset.
[02:02:07.311 --> 02:02:10.713]  A lot of people, for fear, decide to go ahead and just join this thing.
[02:02:11.113 --> 02:02:13.494]  I know, but they say, well, we've only got two choices.
[02:02:14.494 --> 02:02:17.515]  It's a classic military maneuver because what do they do?
[02:02:17.535 --> 02:02:18.636]  What do you do to an enemy?
[02:02:18.676 --> 02:02:20.056]  You divide and conquer them.
[02:02:20.216 --> 02:02:26.779]  And since we're citizens now and we're under a military control apparatus, then...
[02:02:27.814 --> 02:02:32.062]  Listen, I agree with you.
[02:02:32.102 --> 02:02:37.811]  I'm going to put you on hold, and I want you to find that clip, and we'll come back to you in a little while.
[02:02:37.851 --> 02:02:39.394]  We'll go to other calls when we get back.
[02:02:46.181 --> 02:02:51.644]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:52.085 --> 02:02:56.307]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:02:56.547 --> 02:03:03.591]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:03.972 --> 02:03:10.055]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:10.215 --> 02:03:11.436]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:11.776 --> 02:03:14.719]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:03:14.879 --> 02:03:16.881]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:03:17.221 --> 02:03:24.468]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:03:24.749 --> 02:03:28.212]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:03:28.572 --> 02:03:31.755]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free, 866-885-4800.
[02:03:38.625 --> 02:03:41.787]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:03:42.247 --> 02:03:42.848]  Call today.
[02:03:44.869 --> 02:03:49.392]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:49.732 --> 02:03:53.815]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:54.115 --> 02:03:54.675]  We listened.
[02:03:54.975 --> 02:03:59.978]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:00.239 --> 02:04:00.719]  We listened.
[02:04:02.733 --> 02:04:05.093]  We listened.
[02:04:05.554 --> 02:04:09.615]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:04:10.015 --> 02:04:10.495]  We listened.
[02:04:10.835 --> 02:04:16.077]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:04:16.478 --> 02:04:17.818]  Again, we listened.
[02:04:18.197 --> 02:04:25.584]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:04:25.984 --> 02:04:30.469]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:30.489 --> 02:04:31.089]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:04:31.109 --> 02:04:31.810]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:43.191 --> 02:04:44.692]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:04:44.892 --> 02:04:47.954]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:04:48.094 --> 02:04:51.997]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:04:52.057 --> 02:04:56.320]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:04:56.620 --> 02:05:00.422]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:05:00.482 --> 02:05:02.384]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:05:02.524 --> 02:05:02.804]  Liable.
[02:05:02.944 --> 02:05:05.825]  Police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:05:05.885 --> 02:05:10.607]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:05:10.747 --> 02:05:13.808]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[02:05:13.968 --> 02:05:16.829]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:05:17.330 --> 02:05:23.432]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:05:23.973 --> 02:05:27.774]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:05:28.174 --> 02:05:29.554]  Order your video today.
[02:05:29.934 --> 02:05:32.515]  Call toll-free at 888-253-3139.
[02:05:32.615 --> 02:05:38.036]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139.

[02:05:44.358 --> 02:05:49.399]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:49.779 --> 02:05:52.040]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:06:05.394 --> 02:06:24.029]  By the way, in the midst of domestic security agencies, intelligence czars that will be over all crime and terror and run your local police departments, literally, they're busy shutting down access TV around the country, trying to water down the First Amendment on the Internet, calling for censoring that.
[02:06:24.990 --> 02:06:28.273]  Radio stations are being bought up left and right and having neocon...
[02:06:29.276 --> 02:06:30.277]  Garbage put on them.
[02:06:32.118 --> 02:06:38.301]  And last week, we caught them trying to sneak through the takeover of AXS TV to get rid of its free speech charter.
[02:06:38.321 --> 02:06:40.922]  And they're still trying to sneak through with this.
[02:06:40.982 --> 02:06:43.744]  This Thursday at the City Council, they're going to try it.
[02:06:43.764 --> 02:06:48.526]  And we found out the Music Commission is going to try to sneak through with some actions tonight.
[02:06:49.447 --> 02:06:54.149]  That's 6 o'clock, and we'll have a 5-10 minute report for you before the show ends.
[02:06:55.623 --> 02:06:56.063]  We're good to go.
[02:07:24.895 --> 02:07:25.675]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing?
[02:07:25.915 --> 02:07:26.516]  Good, my friend.
[02:07:26.536 --> 02:07:32.037]  It was kind of an interesting guest you had on, an interesting story you were covering earlier.
[02:07:32.357 --> 02:07:35.378]  I guess they really need cops who have a thug mentality.
[02:07:35.398 --> 02:07:50.383]  I was kind of interested, I was just reading, actually just before your show started, I was reading about the LAPD, and I know, I was reading an article a couple weeks ago, the same thing was going on, I guess, with the Memphis Police Department down there in Tennessee.
[02:07:51.421 --> 02:07:55.743]  You know, like all sorts of gangs involved with the police.
[02:07:55.783 --> 02:08:01.484]  In fact, like the police department, the Bloods and the Crips, they are the police officers in L.A.
[02:08:02.065 --> 02:08:09.827]  And I guess the Memphis Police Department, they're having like a bunch of cocaine missing from the property room and stuff like that.
[02:08:11.548 --> 02:08:18.890]  Well, and they've got, speaking of Tennessee, they want to search your house without a warrant, so they torture you for two hours.
[02:08:19.704 --> 02:08:20.705]  We're good to go.
[02:08:37.389 --> 02:08:49.772]  The intelligence agencies openly run the prostitution, run the drugs, control the society, and our intelligence agencies have been working with these people for 50 plus years, and now they're the kingpins globally.
[02:08:50.472 --> 02:08:59.254]  And so we have organized crime with badges and guns, carrying out terror attacks to scare us into accepting them totally enslaving us.
[02:08:59.514 --> 02:09:00.614]  I mean, it's really that simple.
[02:09:01.375 --> 02:09:06.916]  In fact, I think an interesting guest for you to have on tonight, his name is Russell Poole.
[02:09:07.677 --> 02:09:18.479]  And he actually worked with LAPD and tried to expose the fact that it wasn't just a case of police officers becoming criminals.
[02:09:18.499 --> 02:09:20.940]  It was criminals who were becoming police officers.
[02:09:21.700 --> 02:09:24.360]  And there's a very widespread problem with LAPD.
[02:09:24.380 --> 02:09:25.701]  His name is Russell Poole.
[02:09:26.401 --> 02:09:31.662]  In fact, I think he even retired short of his 20-year mark because he couldn't handle it anymore.
[02:09:32.682 --> 02:09:34.462]  But he'd be an interesting guest.
[02:09:35.123 --> 02:09:36.863]  And then one thing I wanted to ask you about...
[02:09:37.942 --> 02:09:46.205]  Your theory about the drill being used to get Norad to stand down, I think we're wrong on that.
[02:09:46.685 --> 02:09:54.248]  I think actually the drill was used to get Norad to stand up, to make it look like there was some sort of real hijacking.
[02:09:57.169 --> 02:10:00.170]  Okay, I'm confused, my simple mind is.
[02:10:00.210 --> 02:10:01.410]  For those that just joined us,
[02:10:02.168 --> 02:10:10.934]  Why don't you tell them about the drill at 8.30 in the morning on 9-11 and what I say happened, and then you can explain to me what you're saying.
[02:10:11.714 --> 02:10:20.240]  Okay, well, actually, my understanding is probably like a couple different drills, multi-agency.
[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:22.381]  Well, yeah, they had a drill six months before.
[02:10:22.421 --> 02:10:24.123]  They had a drill a couple weeks before.
[02:10:24.183 --> 02:10:29.246]  But that morning, they had a drill of hijacked jets flying into the World Trade Center in Pentagon.
[02:10:29.606 --> 02:10:30.687]  At that very time...
[02:10:31.505 --> 02:10:37.149]  And the folks in NORAD, who've been deposed, by the way, by lawyers I've talked to, say, we didn't know it was a hijacking.
[02:10:37.169 --> 02:10:41.051]  We were told it was a drill until the first plane hit.
[02:10:41.432 --> 02:10:48.396]  In fact, NORAD officers thought it was part of something called Operation Vigilant Guardian, I believe.
[02:10:48.616 --> 02:10:48.876]  Yes.
[02:10:49.377 --> 02:10:52.319]  And that's what they were really under the impression of.
[02:10:52.339 --> 02:10:53.239]  So what are you saying?
[02:10:53.259 --> 02:10:54.420]  I'm not following.
[02:10:54.780 --> 02:11:00.224]  See, now, suppose there were no real hijackers and drone aircraft were sent up and placed...
[02:11:01.221 --> 02:11:10.150]  What I've got from sources is it was nerve gas on the planes.
[02:11:11.351 --> 02:11:12.553]  That's from government sources.
[02:11:12.913 --> 02:11:14.555]  I have to disagree with that.
[02:11:14.675 --> 02:11:18.819]  I've heard that theory.
[02:11:19.260 --> 02:11:20.441]  It doesn't make sense.
[02:11:20.581 --> 02:11:23.304]  Basically, it's saying the original planes had knockout gas.
[02:11:23.854 --> 02:11:25.616]  Those ended up in the Atlantic Ocean.
[02:11:26.257 --> 02:11:28.058]  Look, look, look.
[02:11:28.079 --> 02:11:36.688]  Sir, sir, sir, regardless, I'm going to stick with, why did the White House call Mayor Willie Brown and tell him not to fly to New York that day?
[02:11:37.028 --> 02:11:40.452]  Why did the Joint Chiefs of Staff tell Newsweek they were told not to fly to New York that day?
[02:11:41.112 --> 02:11:43.094]  Why are the Bushes in business with the Bin Ladens?
[02:11:43.134 --> 02:11:44.536]  Why is this denied when it's public?
[02:11:46.572 --> 02:11:48.113]  Al Qaeda is CIA.
[02:11:48.253 --> 02:11:51.094]  Why were so-called hijackers trained at the Pensacola Naval Air Station?
[02:11:51.495 --> 02:11:54.816]  Why were their houses, cars, and credit cards paid for by the FBI?
[02:11:55.697 --> 02:12:02.361]  Yeah, but I just think that that theory, it involves using unnecessarily a few too many planes.
[02:12:02.401 --> 02:12:06.103]  Because if you can take planes and dump them in the Atlantic Ocean...
[02:12:06.710 --> 02:12:14.893]  Why not just use those planes and send them into the... But again, sir, we can argue from now to the end of time about this and never know.
[02:12:15.033 --> 02:12:16.234]  I just stick to the stuff I know.
[02:12:16.294 --> 02:12:22.116]  But what I'm saying is I don't think there was a real hijacking, and I think that the trick was to try to get Norad to stand up.
[02:12:22.936 --> 02:12:29.179]  Because right now, I mean, really, I think it's a red herring to say that Norad stood down.
[02:12:29.199 --> 02:12:29.759]  I do.
[02:12:29.819 --> 02:12:32.920]  I think that's actually... Well, Norad did stand down.
[02:12:33.826 --> 02:12:39.010]  Hey, go up in your Cessna, of course, for five minutes and see what happens to you.
[02:12:39.310 --> 02:12:43.833]  Well, suppose they had intercepted the planes before they reached their final destination.
[02:12:43.873 --> 02:12:49.137]  It's standard operating procedure to shoot them down with no presidential or vice presidential authorization.
[02:12:49.558 --> 02:12:56.403]  But three months before 9-11, Rumsfeld took that authority away from the generals and admirals and took that unto himself.
[02:12:56.463 --> 02:12:58.164]  But thanks for the call, Mark.
[02:12:58.925 --> 02:13:02.087]  I just, you know, I mean, we're just sitting here arguing about apples and oranges.
[02:13:03.035 --> 02:13:06.877]  I mean, we have to speculate as to what really happened.
[02:13:07.278 --> 02:13:08.078]  But we know this.
[02:13:08.158 --> 02:13:13.141]  Their official story has been proven to be a fraud, and we've caught them lying over and over again.
[02:13:13.922 --> 02:13:16.083]  So we have to ask ourselves, what is the truth?
[02:13:16.463 --> 02:13:17.524]  What is the reality?
[02:13:19.225 --> 02:13:21.226]  All I know is they had total prior knowledge.
[02:13:21.246 --> 02:13:22.007]  That's been proven.
[02:13:22.567 --> 02:13:28.130]  All I know is they had the motive, and then they have massive connections to the people they claimed did it.
[02:13:28.450 --> 02:13:30.972]  So either way you look at it, the globalists are involved.
[02:13:33.448 --> 02:13:33.868]  Oh, boy.
[02:13:33.948 --> 02:13:35.548]  You know, it's like a murder investigation.
[02:13:35.588 --> 02:13:38.089]  The cops know that they've got their man.
[02:13:38.149 --> 02:13:43.150]  We know who's got the motive, who's got the blood on him, who witnesses saw with the dead person.
[02:13:43.870 --> 02:13:48.871]  And so we know that they're the main suspect, and we know we've caught them lying a bunch.
[02:13:51.012 --> 02:13:53.792]  Again, I'm using the murder investigation analogy.
[02:13:53.812 --> 02:13:56.653]  So we know the globalists are our man.
[02:13:58.483 --> 02:13:59.604]  We even have official U.S.
[02:13:59.624 --> 02:14:03.166]  government plans to carry out 9-11-style attacks, like Operation Northwoods.
[02:14:03.766 --> 02:14:05.907]  We have the government saying why they want to do this.
[02:14:06.547 --> 02:14:07.508]  Why they want to do this.
[02:14:07.828 --> 02:14:11.590]  Why they want to hijack jets and crash them, and why they want to bomb D.C.
[02:14:11.630 --> 02:14:13.891]  and shoot Marines and blame it on foreign enemies.
[02:14:14.691 --> 02:14:19.754]  All the stuff we've seen them doing, we have an official government plan that describes how to do this.
[02:14:21.986 --> 02:14:37.039]  Operation Northwoods describes a list of military people in plainclothes boarding a public airport, getting on a plane, landing that aircraft at another location, and then having drones fly around and crash, and then issuing fake death lists.
[02:14:39.581 --> 02:14:42.763]  And you say, well, how are they going to do that with military people's names?
[02:14:43.124 --> 02:14:44.305]  They're going to stage their deaths.
[02:14:45.822 --> 02:14:47.283]  Let's go ahead and go back to Eric.
[02:15:15.473 --> 02:15:16.494]  Eric, do you have that clip?
[02:15:19.416 --> 02:15:20.958]  Do we have Eric in Tennessee there?
[02:15:21.758 --> 02:15:22.339]  No, this is Tim.
[02:15:23.239 --> 02:15:25.441]  Okay, yeah, we're not going to Tim yet, Stephanie.
[02:15:25.461 --> 02:15:30.545]  Remember, we're going back to Eric, who has the clip of Bush talking about taking over Congress.
[02:15:32.047 --> 02:15:32.747]  Hello, Alex?
[02:15:33.148 --> 02:15:34.028]  Yes, Eric, go ahead.
[02:15:34.288 --> 02:15:35.449]  Yeah, I've got the clip ready.
[02:15:36.030 --> 02:15:36.931]  Yeah, go ahead and play that.
[02:15:37.211 --> 02:15:37.931]  Okay, I sure will.
[02:15:37.951 --> 02:15:38.812]  Hold on just a second.
[02:15:38.852 --> 02:15:41.514]  I'm going to play just a tad and let me know if it's coming through, okay?
[02:15:41.634 --> 02:15:42.155]  Okay, this is...
[02:15:48.232 --> 02:15:48.972]  No, it's not, sir.
[02:15:49.312 --> 02:15:49.873]  Okay, it's not.
[02:15:49.893 --> 02:15:50.233]  Hold on.
[02:15:50.553 --> 02:15:51.894]  Were you able to hear it at all?
[02:15:52.954 --> 02:15:54.235]  That's just super, super low.
[02:15:54.275 --> 02:15:57.557]  You need to turn the television on and put the phone over by it.
[02:15:57.957 --> 02:15:59.058]  Okay, hold on just a second.
[02:15:59.138 --> 02:16:00.459]  That's how you do it.
[02:16:01.559 --> 02:16:02.800]  Again, I heard this, actually.
[02:16:02.860 --> 02:16:05.902]  I saw part of it on TV, and then I heard a replay of it on the radio.
[02:16:07.523 --> 02:16:08.944]  And I have to take over that Congress.
[02:16:08.984 --> 02:16:09.724]  It's all their fault.
[02:16:09.764 --> 02:16:12.866]  They won't give the... Can you hear that?
[02:16:12.906 --> 02:16:13.706]  Yeah, that's good.
[02:16:13.746 --> 02:16:14.087]  Go ahead.
[02:16:14.107 --> 02:16:14.427]  Okay.
[02:16:14.447 --> 02:16:14.587]  Okay.
[02:16:16.893 --> 02:16:18.734]  1947 National Security Act.
[02:16:18.754 --> 02:16:24.516]  I look forward to working with the members of Congress to move ahead on this important reform.
[02:16:26.317 --> 02:16:30.218]  The 9-11 Commission also made several recommendations about Congress itself.
[02:16:32.199 --> 02:16:43.844]  I strongly agree with the Commission's recommendation that oversight and intelligence, oversight of intelligence and of the Homeland Security must be restructured and made more effective.
[02:16:46.186 --> 02:16:57.293]  There are too many committees with overlapping jurisdiction, which wastes time and makes it difficult for meaningful oversight and reform.
[02:17:00.215 --> 02:17:03.637]  Today I also announced that we will establish a National Counterterrorism Center.
[02:17:05.538 --> 02:17:13.483]  This new center will build on the analytical work, the really good analytical work, of the Terrorist Threat Integration Center.
[02:17:14.366 --> 02:17:14.987]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:17:44.198 --> 02:17:44.879]  Hello, folks.
[02:17:44.959 --> 02:17:52.548]  Alex Jones here introducing Prudent Places USA, an interactive CD book that is your premier resource for hard-to-find information.
[02:17:52.728 --> 02:18:02.781]  Find out about everything from job migration to evacuation information, such as major bridges in disrepair and FEMA evacuation time studies for coastal cities.
[02:18:03.241 --> 02:18:09.085]  Zero in on man-made disaster zones, environmental areas of concern, and natural disaster zones.

[02:18:43.447 --> 02:18:48.171]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[02:18:48.391 --> 02:18:51.834]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[02:18:52.054 --> 02:18:54.516]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[02:18:54.757 --> 02:19:03.364]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[02:19:03.720 --> 02:19:09.523]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[02:19:09.763 --> 02:19:11.704]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[02:19:11.964 --> 02:19:18.888]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.
[02:19:19.248 --> 02:19:25.712]  Midas Resources is pleased to offer a subscription to the International Forecaster Newsletter free of charge with a qualifying order.
[02:19:25.972 --> 02:19:26.452]  That's right.
[02:19:26.532 --> 02:19:33.296]  For a limited time, Midas Resources is offering a one-year subscription to Bob Chapman's powerful newsletter, the International Forecaster.

[02:19:43.981 --> 02:19:46.543]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:47.183 --> 02:19:56.768]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[02:19:57.833 --> 02:20:07.380]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that will let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[02:20:08.401 --> 02:20:13.305]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.
[02:20:14.686 --> 02:20:22.412]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch magazine.
[02:20:23.093 --> 02:20:25.094]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-
[02:20:26.656 --> 02:20:27.337]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:27.377 --> 02:20:27.557]  Call now.
[02:20:27.717 --> 02:20:31.823]  Operators are standing by to take your order for a free subscription.
[02:20:43.266 --> 02:20:44.647]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:21:02.976 --> 02:21:07.719]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:21:07.879 --> 02:21:12.561]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[02:21:12.782 --> 02:21:15.323]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[02:21:15.583 --> 02:21:19.005]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:21:19.165 --> 02:21:22.707]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:21:22.907 --> 02:21:24.648]  All right, folks, we're back live.
[02:21:53.522 --> 02:22:00.926]  We'll go to Tim and others here in just a moment, but Eric was finishing playing this clip, and I appreciate him doing that, of Bush.
[02:22:00.966 --> 02:22:04.627]  This is where he goes back to bashing Congress and how it's all their fault.
[02:22:04.647 --> 02:22:08.329]  They've got to capitulate, give up all their authority, or they're with the terrorists, too.
[02:22:10.050 --> 02:22:12.851]  So please continue with the clip, sir.
[02:22:13.532 --> 02:22:14.432]  Okay, Alex?
[02:22:14.913 --> 02:22:15.253]  Yes.
[02:22:15.513 --> 02:22:17.454]  I was still trying to get it queued up.
[02:22:18.294 --> 02:22:19.535]  I haven't found it yet.
[02:22:19.555 --> 02:22:21.876]  They got it kind of spread out between two different areas.
[02:22:22.290 --> 02:22:26.375]  Yeah, well, just send me the tape, and folks probably saw it on television anyways.
[02:22:26.476 --> 02:22:29.880]  I definitely saw it and heard it today.
[02:22:30.401 --> 02:22:30.841]  Okay.
[02:22:31.402 --> 02:22:35.187]  I'm sorry, I've got part of it queued up, but not the one part.
[02:22:35.387 --> 02:22:36.689]  Okay, well, thanks for the call.
[02:22:36.729 --> 02:22:37.590]  I appreciate it, my friend.
[02:22:38.070 --> 02:22:38.531]  Take care.
[02:22:38.872 --> 02:22:39.713]  Tim, you're on the air.
[02:22:39.753 --> 02:22:40.353]  Thanks for holding.
[02:22:40.373 --> 02:22:40.694]  Go ahead.
[02:22:42.674 --> 02:22:43.034]  Hi, Alex.
[02:22:43.054 --> 02:22:43.354]  How are you?
[02:22:43.574 --> 02:22:43.975]  Good, sir.
[02:22:44.175 --> 02:22:45.255]  Tim from Truth here.
[02:22:45.436 --> 02:22:53.540]  Once again, I'll say teaching and researching United States treasonous hierarchy, which is what we're all involved in here, and bringing the truth to the surface.
[02:22:54.540 --> 02:22:58.343]  You were talking earlier with the lawyer and the homeless man that was arrested.
[02:22:59.063 --> 02:23:03.665]  Did you look at what they were trying to do with the money that was allotted through this McKinney Act?
[02:23:05.847 --> 02:23:06.547]  Be specific.
[02:23:07.371 --> 02:23:14.740]  Well, the McKinney Act was specifically created to be money allocated for the advocacy of the homeless.
[02:23:15.961 --> 02:23:22.889]  And last time I was reading about it, they decided they were going to take part of that money and start RFID chipping all of the homeless people.
[02:23:23.450 --> 02:23:27.673]  I did see that proposed out in California, yes.
[02:23:27.713 --> 02:23:28.374]  What a disgrace.
[02:23:28.434 --> 02:23:38.060]  I mean, here they set aside money where they could provide shelters and maybe create some jobs and help get these people off the streets, but instead they're going to use that money to improve.
[02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:46.266]  Well, it's like hospitals saying, we may put a chip in you when you are enrolled, or, oh, law enforcement may have to have it, and, oh, the Mexican government's doing it.
[02:23:46.687 --> 02:23:48.188]  So this is all really happening.
[02:23:48.728 --> 02:23:51.390]  Over the weekend on Coast to Coast they had James Bamford,
[02:23:52.382 --> 02:23:54.205]  What's your opinion of Mr. Bamford?
[02:23:54.585 --> 02:23:56.808]  Well, he was the producer of... Body of Secrets.
[02:23:57.389 --> 02:24:00.372]  Well, he was the producer of 2020 for a while.
[02:24:00.392 --> 02:24:04.938]  And he's the guy that gave us the name Echelon in a 1986 book he wrote.
[02:24:06.960 --> 02:24:11.602]  And then he wrote another book about NSA two years ago, three years ago, called Body of Secrets.
[02:24:12.162 --> 02:24:15.803]  It actually came out in mid-2001, right before 9-11.
[02:24:16.144 --> 02:24:18.144]  And he's the guy that found Operation Northwoods.
[02:24:18.204 --> 02:24:20.665]  But we've interviewed Mr. Bamford twice.
[02:24:20.685 --> 02:24:27.448]  I mean, he talked about the government carrying out terror attacks, and he talked about the USS Liberty, and he talked about Operation Northwoods.
[02:24:27.648 --> 02:24:28.989]  What did he say on Coast to Coast?
[02:24:29.289 --> 02:24:34.771]  Well, I don't want to get specific with what he said, but the overall impression that I got of the whole interview was...
[02:24:35.185 --> 02:24:38.207]  Yeah, sure, he was talking about it, but he still seemed to be an insider.
[02:24:38.647 --> 02:24:41.689]  You know, because they didn't mention Northwoods, they didn't mention PNAC.
[02:24:41.829 --> 02:24:49.493]  Once they did mention about Condi Rice, saying, well, we had no idea they would use planes as weapons, yet on that very day they say they're having a drill.
[02:24:50.354 --> 02:24:51.375]  Oh, they admitted that?
[02:24:51.615 --> 02:24:52.755]  Right, yes.
[02:24:52.835 --> 02:24:58.899]  But, you know, they didn't mention Dom the Grand Prix and the Happy Hooligans or anything like that.
[02:24:59.019 --> 02:25:03.822]  And I tried, like, the darndest to get through, because my one question is,
[02:25:05.083 --> 02:25:08.166]  The one big unanswered question, accountability.
[02:25:09.347 --> 02:25:11.949]  Who is going to be held accountable for all of this?
[02:25:12.169 --> 02:25:20.136]  Well, Bush says he takes full responsibility and will get massive doubling, doubling, doubling of funding and total control over every federal agency.
[02:25:20.416 --> 02:25:22.858]  Why, that will certainly punish him, give him total power.
[02:25:23.038 --> 02:25:23.238]  Sure.
[02:25:23.258 --> 02:25:28.162]  Do you remember in the 1980s when we had a German teenager land a single-engine plane on Red Square?
[02:25:28.603 --> 02:25:28.883]  Yes.
[02:25:29.103 --> 02:25:31.365]  A couple generals over there were executed.
[02:25:31.894 --> 02:25:34.176]  Some were dropped down to, like, buck privates.
[02:25:34.216 --> 02:25:35.938]  Now, you know, that's accountability.
[02:25:37.599 --> 02:25:41.002]  Yeah, but here you have a three-minute standing ovation at CIA headquarters.
[02:25:41.022 --> 02:25:41.823]  Thanks for the call.
[02:25:42.203 --> 02:25:42.964]  Really good points.
[02:25:43.304 --> 02:25:44.425]  Raymond in Illinois.
[02:25:44.525 --> 02:25:45.486]  Raymond, go ahead.
[02:25:46.026 --> 02:25:50.250]  Yeah, Alex, I just want to say thanks for that phone call to the house earlier.
[02:25:50.270 --> 02:25:54.894]  We were able to get all the tapes straightened out, and everybody's enjoyed them.
[02:25:56.243 --> 02:25:57.404]  I'm confused.
[02:25:57.484 --> 02:25:59.624]  You talked to my customer service people or something?
[02:25:59.684 --> 02:26:02.325]  No, you called me personally about some tapes.
[02:26:02.806 --> 02:26:03.306]  Oh, I did?
[02:26:03.626 --> 02:26:06.507]  Yeah, you called me at the house, and you apologized.
[02:26:06.847 --> 02:26:07.447]  When was that?
[02:26:07.467 --> 02:26:10.448]  That was back in February or March this year.
[02:26:10.708 --> 02:26:11.049]  Oh, good.
[02:26:11.069 --> 02:26:12.009]  So you got your videos?
[02:26:12.089 --> 02:26:12.409]  Oh, yeah.
[02:26:12.429 --> 02:26:14.750]  We got it all straightened out, and you got paid, too.
[02:26:15.270 --> 02:26:20.332]  Listen, the reason I'm calling, you know, everybody talks about Boston and New York,
[02:26:21.175 --> 02:26:23.717]  What about Chicago here with that Sears Tower?
[02:26:23.817 --> 02:26:33.723]  I drive up to Dan Ryan once in a while, and I read off your prisonplanet.com about the Sears Tower being sold and all the mysterious things going on.
[02:26:34.343 --> 02:26:37.225]  What kind of rumors do you hear about this coming up for this fall?
[02:26:37.425 --> 02:26:38.726]  Well, they're not rumors.
[02:26:40.807 --> 02:26:46.131]  They say it's one of the next big terror targets by Al-Shi'aida.
[02:26:46.855 --> 02:26:52.159]  And the owner of the World Trade Center complex, Larry Silverstein... Yeah, he bought the place, I understand.
[02:26:52.479 --> 02:27:02.705]  Well, the Chicago Tribune said a secretive group of investors led by Larry Silverstein bought it, and very, very suspicious.
[02:27:03.986 --> 02:27:14.413]  And we have Larry Silverstein saying that they blew up Building 7, and we got a guy who says they pull buildings, buying your buildings, so I don't know, what do you think?
[02:27:14.989 --> 02:27:23.732]  Well, a lot of people tell me it's propaganda, bro, after watching all your tapes and the other ones that we bought off you.
[02:27:25.213 --> 02:27:26.614]  I don't want to be a predictor.
[02:27:26.634 --> 02:27:31.335]  I don't want them at my door knocking it down, but things don't look too good for Chicago coming up.
[02:27:31.675 --> 02:27:32.636]  I hear you, my friend.
[02:27:33.856 --> 02:27:34.777]  We're on the march.
[02:27:35.257 --> 02:27:36.857]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:37.778 --> 02:27:40.479]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:44.113 --> 02:27:45.794]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:27:45.894 --> 02:27:48.395]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[02:27:48.575 --> 02:27:49.275]  It feels great.
[02:27:49.455 --> 02:27:50.456]  Absolutely wonderful.
[02:27:50.576 --> 02:27:56.098]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:27:56.418 --> 02:27:57.959]  Kimberly, tell us about your success.
[02:27:58.199 --> 02:28:00.560]  Okay, I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[02:28:00.720 --> 02:28:03.881]  I've lost 16 pounds, and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[02:28:04.021 --> 02:28:04.681]  Incredible.
[02:28:04.881 --> 02:28:06.102]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[02:28:06.142 --> 02:28:09.843]  I have a 21-month-old child, and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[02:28:09.923 --> 02:28:10.724]  Well, that's for sure.
[02:28:10.884 --> 02:28:11.424]  Was it easy?
[02:28:11.647 --> 02:28:15.513]  I know you can lose fat the safe and healthy way, just like Kimberly did with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:28:25.256 --> 02:28:28.159]  Call right now, 1-800-622-THIN.
[02:28:28.259 --> 02:28:29.079]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[02:28:31.742 --> 02:28:36.626]  Remember, mention you heard it right here, and that gets you $25 off a three-month supply.
[02:28:36.866 --> 02:28:38.307]  So call Vim and Vigor today, 1-800-622-THIN.
[02:28:38.327 --> 02:28:38.708]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[02:28:43.832 --> 02:28:50.076]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:50.216 --> 02:28:56.360]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:56.660 --> 02:29:05.105]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:05.345 --> 02:29:12.329]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:12.677 --> 02:29:13.418]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:43.897 --> 02:29:44.598]  We're good to go.
[02:30:06.204 --> 02:30:10.448]  It's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[02:30:10.708 --> 02:30:15.212]  Arc's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[02:30:15.413 --> 02:30:19.476]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[02:30:19.556 --> 02:30:26.683]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.

[02:30:32.652 --> 02:30:34.174]  Call the Ark Institute toll-free at 800-255-1912.
[02:30:34.195 --> 02:30:35.456]  That's 1-800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com today.
[02:30:51.503 --> 02:31:05.386]  Alright, Ann, Mike, Ron, Dennis, and Andrea, that'll be all the callers we can take today, but I will get to every single one of you, and I've got about, I don't know, about ten stories I haven't even covered yet that we'll also be covering going over here in a few minutes.
[02:31:06.666 --> 02:31:13.187]  Also, for about five minutes, we're about to be talking to Stefan Ray, who puts the show Democracy Now!
[02:31:13.267 --> 02:31:15.168]  on local access television here in Austin.
[02:31:16.268 --> 02:31:20.349]  And again, whether it's the pro-life organizations or Democracy Now!,
[02:31:21.611 --> 02:31:26.932]  All of these shows are going to be in trouble, folks, if they have their way taking over Axis Television in Austin.
[02:31:27.532 --> 02:31:30.993]  And this is a fight that we see happening all over the country as government takes over.
[02:31:31.433 --> 02:31:36.995]  So it's very, very important, and we'll give you an update on a key meeting here in Austin, Texas, here in just a few minutes.
[02:31:37.415 --> 02:31:38.775]  So have your pens and paper ready.
[02:31:39.675 --> 02:31:43.656]  Before we do that, there's a way to circumvent the mainstream media.
[02:31:44.516 --> 02:31:46.037]  And that's by documentary films.
[02:31:46.157 --> 02:31:50.918]  And I suggest all of you get them and air them on Axis Television in your area.
[02:31:51.539 --> 02:32:01.027]  Whether it's 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, proving that the globalists carried out 9-11, or part two of that film, The Masters of Terror, it'll wake people up in a big way.
[02:32:01.088 --> 02:32:05.091]  We found 90% conversion rates with folks that have seen the films.
[02:32:05.491 --> 02:32:15.600]  I also carry George Humphrey's new video, 9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati, and Eric Huffschmidt's video, 9-11, Painful Deceptions.
[02:32:16.641 --> 02:32:18.503]  That's on VHS and DVD as well.
[02:32:19.278 --> 02:32:27.044]  And so the best 9-11 films I've seen, bar none, are on my website, whether they're my two films or the other two videos we carry.
[02:32:28.453 --> 02:32:31.915]  My videos are $25.95 a piece, all over two hours long.
[02:32:32.035 --> 02:32:33.996]  Order three or more of any of my ten titles.
[02:32:34.336 --> 02:32:35.937]  They drop down to $20 a piece.
[02:32:36.437 --> 02:32:40.679]  We've also got a bunch of other discounts and specials on George Humphrey's videos and other films.

[02:32:59.025 --> 02:33:06.751]  I also have dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove, where I snuck into Bohemian Grove and caught the world leaders engaging in their bizarre rituals.
[02:33:07.292 --> 02:33:09.033]  I have my three police state videos.
[02:33:09.093 --> 02:33:10.174]  I have Matrix of Evil.
[02:33:10.574 --> 02:33:13.156]  They cover it all, folks, and you need to have them.
[02:33:14.337 --> 02:33:16.499]  So please call toll-free.

[02:34:23.360 --> 02:34:24.400]  So please take action.
[02:34:25.037 --> 02:34:25.517]  All right.
[02:34:26.518 --> 02:34:29.259]  Going to Stephan Ray, who puts on Democracy Now!
[02:34:29.339 --> 02:34:30.320]  here in Austin, Texas.
[02:34:32.021 --> 02:34:36.984]  Stephan, you have been on the cutting edge of researching the city's activities.
[02:34:37.942 --> 02:34:38.723]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:34:40.024 --> 02:34:50.232]  Trying to merge AXS TV and get rid of its charter, and you learned of another meeting that no one had been told about, searching around on the city website, and it's coming up this evening.
[02:34:50.272 --> 02:34:50.813]  Tell us about it.
[02:34:51.053 --> 02:34:51.934]  Right, exactly.
[02:34:52.574 --> 02:35:02.822]  Well, it's the meeting of the Austin Music Commission, and the Austin Music Commission is one of the, you know how Austin has all these various boards and commissions?
[02:35:02.842 --> 02:35:07.226]  Well, that's the one that has some oversight function for the Austin Music Network.
[02:35:07.859 --> 02:35:08.580]  We're good to go.
[02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:09.140]  We're good to go.
[02:35:29.111 --> 02:35:29.451]  Okay.
[02:35:29.611 --> 02:35:30.231]  Thank you very much.
[02:35:59.185 --> 02:36:00.025]  We're good to go.
[02:36:29.256 --> 02:36:46.953]  And it would be really good if those who defend free speech TV and public access television and non-commercial content-driven, producer-driven, content-neutral, producer-driven radio and television in Austin to go to that meeting.
[02:36:48.590 --> 02:36:50.211]  Now, let's give folks the address.
[02:36:50.231 --> 02:36:52.052]  505 Barton Springs.
[02:36:52.092 --> 02:36:53.593]  Is that over by the Doherty Arts Center?
[02:36:55.234 --> 02:36:56.794]  It's not too far from there.
[02:36:57.235 --> 02:37:05.759]  It's basically on South 1st Street and Barton Springs.
[02:37:05.779 --> 02:37:07.439]  There's a big tall building on the corner there.
[02:37:07.479 --> 02:37:09.520]  It's 1 Texas Center.
[02:37:09.540 --> 02:37:12.002]  1 Texas Center.
[02:37:12.202 --> 02:37:13.042]  Do you know what room?
[02:37:13.222 --> 02:37:13.982]  Yeah, it's room 325.
[02:37:16.081 --> 02:37:19.825]  325-505 Barton Springs, corner of 1st Street.
[02:37:20.266 --> 02:37:21.487]  Folks, you cannot miss it.
[02:37:22.728 --> 02:37:24.330]  Big building, as Stefan said.
[02:37:25.916 --> 02:37:27.898]  Again, they go, we're not taking over your channels.
[02:37:27.918 --> 02:37:33.442]  We're just going to control what you can say and ratchet free speech down to one channel to start with and have music on the other.
[02:37:33.482 --> 02:37:34.943]  It has nothing to do with free speech.
[02:37:35.483 --> 02:37:41.348]  And then Time Warner is jumping around, involved in all of this, trying to donate money so we'll all go along with this.
[02:37:42.108 --> 02:37:46.512]  Very, very serious, because as the tyranny increases, we're going to need...
[02:37:47.569 --> 02:37:52.653]  These types of venues, these platforms, these forums, these are absolutely precious.
[02:37:52.693 --> 02:37:54.134]  And this is happening all over the country.
[02:37:54.414 --> 02:37:56.076]  So this affects you all over the country.
[02:37:56.776 --> 02:38:04.322]  And I would certainly hope that everybody listening, tell their friends, their neighbors, their co-workers and their listeners, bring a friend.
[02:38:04.883 --> 02:38:06.064]  I'll be there 6 o'clock.
[02:38:06.704 --> 02:38:08.986]  What agenda item is it, Stefan?
[02:38:09.706 --> 02:38:10.987]  It's agenda item number 5.
[02:38:11.668 --> 02:38:15.451]  So there are a few things prior to that.
[02:38:15.511 --> 02:38:16.732]  So if you come a little late,
[02:38:17.490 --> 02:38:18.271]  You won't miss anything.
[02:38:18.291 --> 02:38:28.539]  There's citizens communications first, and there's something involving the Austin Police Department immediately prior to the item on ACTV.
[02:38:28.559 --> 02:38:29.480]  So, folks, get there at 6.
[02:38:29.900 --> 02:38:35.825]  You can sign up, speak in three minutes, and go, we're not for this, leave us alone, and then you're done.
[02:38:35.985 --> 02:38:38.727]  So I think we'll get a big crowd out there, Stefan.
[02:38:39.047 --> 02:38:46.353]  And also, just as a heads up, this also is going to be discussed at the city council meeting.
[02:38:47.182 --> 02:38:48.864]  On Thursday in Austin.
[02:38:49.004 --> 02:38:51.006]  Now, City Council goes on all day.
[02:38:52.948 --> 02:38:57.712]  But I'm looking at the City Council's agenda right now in front of me on their website.
[02:38:58.533 --> 02:39:04.119]  And it looks like they're intending to deal with this item.
[02:39:04.159 --> 02:39:07.161]  It's item number 32 before noon, before 12 p.m.
[02:39:10.222 --> 02:39:13.803]  At least that's the order that they have it in on their agenda.
[02:39:13.883 --> 02:39:16.184]  What time do they convene the city council meeting?
[02:39:16.384 --> 02:39:24.446]  The city council actually starts at 10 o'clock in the morning is when they convene.
[02:39:25.186 --> 02:39:27.087]  And is there a citizen communication then?
[02:39:28.167 --> 02:39:34.029]  No, the citizen's communication at city council actually occurs at noon.
[02:39:34.209 --> 02:39:36.049]  I think they've scheduled it around the lunch hour.
[02:39:36.410 --> 02:39:37.070]  But in order to...
[02:39:38.553 --> 02:39:46.098]  That particular sort of communication is something that you would have had to have signed up for last week, and that's full.
[02:39:46.198 --> 02:39:49.520]  I think you can only sign up to specific items.
[02:39:49.600 --> 02:39:52.022]  So you could go there at 10 in the morning if you can.
[02:39:52.042 --> 02:39:58.045]  A lot of people can't, but if you can, you could go there in the morning and sign up to speak on agenda item number 32.
[02:39:58.085 --> 02:40:04.109]  And if enough people sign up on an agenda item, then they have to open it up to public hearing.
[02:40:04.429 --> 02:40:05.030]  A lot of times...
[02:40:05.635 --> 02:40:05.795]  No.
[02:40:05.815 --> 02:40:05.875]  No.
[02:40:26.056 --> 02:40:27.417]  You know, I go down there in the morning.
[02:40:27.558 --> 02:40:28.879]  I mean, if I have to, I'll do a rebroadcast.
[02:40:29.099 --> 02:40:30.081]  I mean, this is important enough.
[02:40:30.141 --> 02:40:31.803]  I'll do a rebroadcast, though I don't want to.
[02:40:31.843 --> 02:40:35.407]  I'm sure you guys can take all this in hand, but everybody needs to be there.
[02:40:36.308 --> 02:40:40.293]  But I have to get there in the morning to sign up to later speak on the agenda item?
[02:40:41.034 --> 02:40:41.094]  Um...
[02:40:41.849 --> 02:40:43.851]  I believe you definitely want to get there.
[02:40:44.491 --> 02:40:47.733]  You have to get there before the agenda item is heard.
[02:40:47.934 --> 02:40:51.716]  Well, I know with the Patriot Act, though, they let us sign up an hour before.
[02:40:51.736 --> 02:40:53.898]  Yeah, you can probably do that.
[02:40:54.278 --> 02:41:00.183]  But what I'm saying is that it's impossible to know exactly when an agenda item is going to be on their schedule.
[02:41:00.383 --> 02:41:03.745]  The most I can tell from looking at this is that it's before noon.
[02:41:04.546 --> 02:41:07.868]  The best person to get a handle on this would be to call the city clerk's
[02:41:09.805 --> 02:41:20.289]  You know what, I'm going to call Jackie Goodman's... There's a number here about... If people want to call and ask about this agenda item, it's 974-3256.
[02:41:20.389 --> 02:41:24.791]  That's the phone number that's listed at the bottom of the city's... And that's 512-974-3256?
[02:41:25.011 --> 02:41:27.672]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:41:27.692 --> 02:41:28.712]  Okay.
[02:41:28.752 --> 02:41:35.375]  Now, just so people understand what this is, what this is about, what this agenda item says, it says it's directing...
[02:41:36.090 --> 02:42:02.282]  If approved by council, it's directing the city manager to transfer remaining funds under contract with what's called the Kenneth Threadgill Music Project, that's the actual management of the Austin Music Network, to ACAC or ACTV, and to assist in transitioning existing AMN programming hours from Channel 15 to the access channels managed by ACTV.
[02:42:04.671 --> 02:42:14.839]  But the problem with that is that anybody can be a producer on ACTV, and if these AMN producers want to put shows on any of the access channels, that's fine.
[02:42:15.139 --> 02:42:16.460]  They just have to follow existing rules.
[02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:20.243]  They have to go down there, they have to become a producer, and they submit their programming.
[02:42:20.303 --> 02:42:30.951]  They can put in a special request for a little mini-series if they wanted to during the time until the end of the AMN contract if they can't put it on AMN.
[02:42:31.331 --> 02:42:32.732]  They don't need to be legislating
[02:42:33.610 --> 02:42:37.311]  The city doesn't need to be legislating the type of program that they can put on.
[02:42:37.331 --> 02:42:39.331]  Yeah, that totally violates their charter.
[02:42:39.551 --> 02:42:57.155]  It violates the franchise agreement, and it violates what's called a 1991, what I'm calling ACTV's 1991 free speech preamble, which says basically that the content is supposed to be producer-driven.
[02:42:57.637 --> 02:43:00.679]  And not put in an audience that's stalled from above.
[02:43:00.720 --> 02:43:08.406]  And it's been sort of slowly eroding at ACTV over the years, where you have people, you know, you have like this Army Watch channel.
[02:43:08.426 --> 02:43:12.609]  You have all these various things that aren't producer-driven content that's getting put in there.
[02:43:12.669 --> 02:43:15.431]  Yeah, government propaganda taking over, and that's the plan.
[02:43:15.751 --> 02:43:18.093]  Okay, Stefan, I will see you down there tonight, brother.
[02:43:18.353 --> 02:43:18.654]  Okay.
[02:43:19.054 --> 02:43:20.295]  Take care, and I appreciate that.
[02:43:21.630 --> 02:43:22.151]  All right.
[02:43:22.491 --> 02:43:23.811]  I want to thank the callers for holding.
[02:43:23.851 --> 02:43:26.713]  Let's now go to Ann in New Mexico.
[02:43:26.913 --> 02:43:27.553]  Ann, go ahead.
[02:43:27.953 --> 02:43:28.694]  Hi, Alex.
[02:43:28.794 --> 02:43:29.094]  Hello.
[02:43:29.114 --> 02:43:30.655]  Yahweh bless you.
[02:43:31.355 --> 02:43:32.035]  God bless you, too.
[02:43:32.055 --> 02:43:32.976]  Thank you.
[02:43:33.036 --> 02:43:34.216]  Two comments and a question.
[02:43:34.957 --> 02:43:36.337]  You know, it's a battle over turf.
[02:43:37.058 --> 02:43:44.041]  The devil is fighting to maintain his turf, which is planet Earth, with his global intelligence command and control cabal.
[02:43:44.690 --> 02:43:48.611]  You know, spy in the sky, street cameras... No, no, right, that's it.
[02:43:48.651 --> 02:43:54.433]  The Total Information Awareness Network, all of this is about government trying to duplicate and counterfeit God.
[02:43:54.713 --> 02:43:55.473]  Exactly.
[02:43:55.553 --> 02:43:56.234]  You nailed it.
[02:43:56.514 --> 02:43:56.934]  Exactly.
[02:43:56.994 --> 02:43:57.354]  Hallelujah.
[02:43:57.394 --> 02:43:58.534]  The state is not God.
[02:43:58.574 --> 02:43:59.214]  I'm here to tell them.
[02:43:59.274 --> 02:43:59.655]  Hallelujah.
[02:44:00.295 --> 02:44:08.217]  And we need to unplug from propaganda TV, fake food, charade politics, and plug into the living word of Yahweh.
[02:44:09.178 --> 02:44:09.998]  Now, here's a question.
[02:44:10.818 --> 02:44:13.899]  Last week you were playing a clip
[02:44:15.228 --> 02:44:16.329]  Yes.
[02:44:17.149 --> 02:44:26.473]  Well, that's the whole point.
[02:44:27.393 --> 02:44:36.277]  And what makes it more important is they went in and edited out the audio on the other clips on TV, and they changed the transcripts.
[02:44:36.297 --> 02:44:39.158]  Yeah, you know, they're revealing themselves.
[02:44:39.178 --> 02:44:40.879]  Well, they do this with Bush all the time.
[02:44:40.939 --> 02:44:43.100]  So in the past, they didn't do this.
[02:44:43.420 --> 02:44:43.640]  Yeah.
[02:44:44.059 --> 02:44:46.980]  Well, and by the way, Sears has 110 stories.
[02:44:47.420 --> 02:44:48.481]  Sears has 11 again.
[02:44:50.442 --> 02:44:51.922]  And I just finished reading a book.
[02:44:51.983 --> 02:44:53.103]  I don't know, what did you think of it?
[02:44:53.163 --> 02:44:56.845]  It was John Ronson's Them, Adventures with Extremists.
[02:44:57.345 --> 02:44:58.225]  And you were in the book.
[02:44:58.545 --> 02:45:00.606]  I know about half of what he says about me is a lie.
[02:45:00.926 --> 02:45:03.087]  Well, yeah, but you were portrayed favorably.
[02:45:03.267 --> 02:45:06.629]  I read it, and yes, there were some moments that I thought, hey.
[02:45:07.048 --> 02:45:07.829]  He's slanting it.
[02:45:08.149 --> 02:45:09.630]  Well, I mean, this is the kind of stuff.
[02:45:09.710 --> 02:45:11.431]  I enjoyed the book.
[02:45:11.551 --> 02:45:14.053]  And listen, you're a warrior, so I know the truth.
[02:45:14.873 --> 02:45:16.154]  I know the truth, Alex.
[02:45:16.694 --> 02:45:18.335]  And I don't care what he said, but I did read it.
[02:45:18.355 --> 02:45:20.517]  It was a New York Times bestseller, yeah.
[02:45:20.877 --> 02:45:23.739]  Well, I read it and enjoyed it, and I learned some things.
[02:45:23.859 --> 02:45:25.980]  TV is the flickering light.
[02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:27.902]  It hypnotizes people.
[02:45:28.882 --> 02:45:30.363]  They teach that in college.
[02:45:30.764 --> 02:45:32.665]  Yeah, and Randy... It's not any big secret.
[02:45:32.905 --> 02:45:35.607]  Yeah, Randy Weaver mentioned that in that book, so...
[02:45:36.371 --> 02:45:39.832]  At any rate, Alex, shall we bless you and keep up the good work?
[02:45:39.852 --> 02:45:46.275]  Because you're a warrior, and you've got it nailed down, and you're telling exactly what's happening.
[02:45:46.315 --> 02:45:47.155]  Well, Ann, you're awesome.
[02:45:47.175 --> 02:45:47.875]  Thanks for the call.
[02:45:48.055 --> 02:45:48.255]  All right.
[02:45:48.576 --> 02:45:58.139]  Yeah, John Ronson, this national British radio, he's done radio, TV, everything, and he followed and tracked my infiltration of the Grove.
[02:45:59.180 --> 02:46:00.360]  And then he writes this book.
[02:46:01.796 --> 02:46:06.860]  And just read the book and then watch his own video that airs on Trio and it doesn't match up.
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:11.142]  I mean, I don't have to call the guy a twister or a liar.
[02:46:12.043 --> 02:46:22.110]  You can just watch his Trio Network TV show he produced that I'm in and what he says happened at the Grove there and then read his book and then ask yourself, which John Ronson's telling the truth?
[02:46:22.370 --> 02:46:24.652]  And I'll tell you both versions have got some twisting.
[02:46:25.072 --> 02:46:26.653]  The book more so than the video.
[02:46:28.860 --> 02:46:33.824]  So just get my video, The Real Deal, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, and you'll know what happened.
[02:46:34.124 --> 02:46:35.025]  You'll have the video of it.
[02:46:36.006 --> 02:46:39.849]  But let me give you an example, just one petty example.
[02:46:40.730 --> 02:46:43.111]  It was on the top of the New York Times bestseller list.
[02:46:43.131 --> 02:46:43.772]  It was ridiculous.
[02:46:45.013 --> 02:46:46.194]  Please don't spend your money on it.
[02:46:47.495 --> 02:46:49.216]  Now you'll run out and buy it immediately.
[02:46:50.117 --> 02:46:56.322]  But John Ronson, I'm driving, I'm lost in Northern California at midnight.
[02:46:57.199 --> 02:46:59.381]  And I say on the cell phone, man, it's spooky.
[02:46:59.421 --> 02:47:01.622]  There's five foot deep fog.
[02:47:01.662 --> 02:47:03.184]  This place is like Transylvania.
[02:47:04.525 --> 02:47:05.305]  You know, just laughing.
[02:47:05.325 --> 02:47:06.366]  Man, this place is spooky.
[02:47:06.386 --> 02:47:12.231]  And I'm calling him on the phone lost, trying to find a little motel in the middle of nowhere in Occidental, the name of the town, outside Monterey.
[02:47:12.891 --> 02:47:16.354]  And his book, Jones was cowering in fear, afraid of vampires.
[02:47:16.394 --> 02:47:17.695]  We're about to suck his blood.
[02:47:17.715 --> 02:47:21.498]  I mean, he literally was, you know, that's the kind of stuff he pulled in that book.
[02:47:23.920 --> 02:47:26.942]  He said it was kind of like dark humor or something, but I don't think it's funny.
[02:47:28.224 --> 02:47:30.045]  Let's talk to Mike in Arizona.
[02:47:30.065 --> 02:47:30.846]  Mike, thanks for holding.
[02:47:30.866 --> 02:47:31.266]  Go ahead.
[02:47:31.706 --> 02:47:32.106]  Hi, Alex.
[02:47:32.427 --> 02:47:32.887]  Hello, sir.
[02:47:33.907 --> 02:47:38.230]  You were talking earlier about apparently a new push for a domestic CIA.
[02:47:38.250 --> 02:47:42.312]  Do you remember where you saw that or read it?
[02:47:42.732 --> 02:47:47.335]  Oh, I've got the Washington Post, the Associated Press, right here in front of me.
[02:47:47.435 --> 02:47:49.356]  It's a new intelligence czar.
[02:47:49.376 --> 02:47:51.697]  You can actually find the article here.
[02:47:52.618 --> 02:47:56.020]  This is out of Alistair Bull out of Reuters.
[02:47:57.558 --> 02:48:07.525]  And Bush, this morning, proposed... I'm sure you've heard about them proposing a new giant intelligence czar over the 15 agencies.
[02:48:08.066 --> 02:48:08.826]  Yeah, well, that came out.
[02:48:09.247 --> 02:48:13.149]  Fareed Zakaria was pushing for that, you know, not too many months after 9-11.
[02:48:13.169 --> 02:48:15.471]  But it kind of died down.
[02:48:15.491 --> 02:48:16.392]  Yeah, stay there, Mike.
[02:48:16.412 --> 02:48:18.333]  We'll talk about it when we get back.
[02:48:18.373 --> 02:48:19.014]  No, exactly.
[02:48:19.074 --> 02:48:23.537]  I mean, the 9-11 Commission said at the beginning of the commission they were going to call for a domestic CIA agent.
[02:48:24.147 --> 02:48:27.251]  Well, first it was we're going to have the CIA have the gloves taken off domestically.
[02:48:27.692 --> 02:48:31.998]  And then now, oh no, it's got to be a new super agency with billions of dollars of funding a year.
[02:48:33.200 --> 02:48:38.787]  And Bush said this would be as big a change as the 1947 National Security Act.
[02:48:38.807 --> 02:48:39.388]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:39.408 --> 02:48:39.729]  Stay with us.
[02:48:43.897 --> 02:48:48.181]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:48.361 --> 02:48:52.786]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:52.926 --> 02:48:57.310]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:57.350 --> 02:48:58.712]  The New World Order.
[02:48:59.472 --> 02:49:00.473]  Can emerge.
[02:49:00.493 --> 02:49:04.695]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:04.775 --> 02:49:11.698]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:11.838 --> 02:49:13.819]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:14.229 --> 02:49:24.554]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:24.835 --> 02:49:30.197]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[02:49:30.718 --> 02:49:33.339]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:49:33.359 --> 02:49:34.620]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[02:49:43.191 --> 02:49:50.716]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey light LED system.
[02:49:50.996 --> 02:50:03.985]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[02:50:04.266 --> 02:50:07.548]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:50:07.908 --> 02:50:18.375]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:50:18.656 --> 02:50:19.156]  That's right.
[02:50:19.336 --> 02:50:26.461]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:50:26.741 --> 02:50:35.327]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-

[02:51:56.238 --> 02:51:58.739]  You're talking about... I'm sorry.
[02:51:58.979 --> 02:51:59.519]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:52:00.419 --> 02:52:03.180]  I was looking for the link to the story that you're referring to.
[02:52:03.360 --> 02:52:06.661]  Is it on your... It should be.
[02:52:06.701 --> 02:52:09.422]  It's top story all over the news.
[02:52:11.143 --> 02:52:12.563]  Bush came out and gave a speech.
[02:52:12.603 --> 02:52:17.885]  We aired a clip of it earlier and called this morning for this new intelligence czar.
[02:52:18.285 --> 02:52:19.845]  Okay, but it was a Reuters story?
[02:52:21.646 --> 02:52:22.006]  Yes.
[02:52:22.106 --> 02:52:23.406]  There's actually a couple of them.
[02:52:24.807 --> 02:52:24.927]  It's...
[02:52:26.084 --> 02:52:27.085]  Everybody's reporting on it.
[02:52:27.525 --> 02:52:27.805]  Okay.
[02:52:28.205 --> 02:52:29.706]  I don't have a computer on in front of me.
[02:52:29.766 --> 02:52:30.186]  I'm sorry.
[02:52:30.466 --> 02:52:30.686]  All right.
[02:52:30.706 --> 02:52:31.667]  If I can track it down for that.
[02:52:32.367 --> 02:52:33.168]  What do you think of that?
[02:52:34.308 --> 02:52:46.694]  Well, you know, obviously in the past there's been a pretty bright line between the CIA, you know, doing domestic surveillance and the FBI.
[02:52:47.975 --> 02:52:51.637]  I mean, we know that the CIA was, you know, via echelon was
[02:52:52.486 --> 02:52:58.330]  And the NSA were spying on us, but they weren't allowed to use any evidence they would gather.
[02:52:58.431 --> 02:53:01.433]  Well, also, now this is going to be funding outside Congress.
[02:53:01.493 --> 02:53:04.095]  It's owned funding, and it's going to be over all the other agencies.
[02:53:05.996 --> 02:53:10.179]  Yeah, well, I guess there'll be no more $500 toilets and, you know, true drivers.
[02:53:11.100 --> 02:53:16.484]  You know, if they have their own little slush fund, they don't have to go through that process.
[02:53:17.248 --> 02:53:21.751]  Exactly, and if it's not posted, I'll post a bunch of stories on this.
[02:53:21.791 --> 02:53:22.472]  Thanks for the call.
[02:53:23.332 --> 02:53:26.654]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Ron in New York.
[02:53:26.734 --> 02:53:27.455]  Ron, go ahead.
[02:53:27.475 --> 02:53:28.275]  Hi, Alex.
[02:53:28.596 --> 02:53:28.876]  Hello.
[02:53:29.176 --> 02:53:38.862]  Alex, if after the events of the last two weeks, anybody in this country cannot see what's going on, they are insane, insane.
[02:53:38.882 --> 02:53:39.923]  You have to be out of your mind.
[02:53:40.686 --> 02:53:43.948]  There is no more ambiguity about what's happening here.
[02:53:44.028 --> 02:53:45.168]  No, I mean, it's all out in the open.
[02:53:45.188 --> 02:53:47.850]  Did you see Bush announcing we need our own domestic takeover?
[02:53:48.210 --> 02:53:50.791]  That is just one of many things, yes.
[02:53:50.911 --> 02:53:56.454]  They're talking about implementing the 9-11 Commission's recommendations.
[02:53:57.054 --> 02:54:06.899]  Now, one of those implementations is to create an intelligence clearinghouse, an intelligence superintelligence agency that will collect data
[02:54:08.115 --> 02:54:11.700]  Domestically as well as foreign, on terrorists.
[02:54:11.760 --> 02:54:15.084]  Now the question is, how are we defining a terrorist?
[02:54:15.184 --> 02:54:23.354]  That definition of terrorist has been expanded and inflated so broadly that when one asks the question, what is a terrorist?
[02:54:23.534 --> 02:54:24.115]  The answer is,
[02:54:24.793 --> 02:54:26.895]  Anything they choose at all.
[02:54:26.995 --> 02:54:29.017]  Well, yeah, that's Section 802.
[02:54:29.357 --> 02:54:29.517]  Right.
[02:54:29.958 --> 02:54:31.619]  Anything they choose to make it at all.
[02:54:32.040 --> 02:54:38.286]  So people who participate in lawful protests will probably wind up being databases terrorists.
[02:54:38.806 --> 02:54:40.147]  This is the worst thing to do.
[02:54:40.648 --> 02:54:42.810]  They're tricking the American people.
[02:54:42.850 --> 02:54:46.053]  I mean, anybody that believes this at this point is out of his mind.
[02:54:46.373 --> 02:54:47.334]  I think it's clinically ill.
[02:54:47.834 --> 02:54:49.436]  They're tricking them into believing.
[02:54:50.205 --> 02:54:52.106]  That, you know, well, this is to fight terrorism.
[02:54:52.266 --> 02:55:01.572]  Well, they're making it clear at the same time their hostility towards routine traditional American behaviors like redressing your government and protesting.
[02:55:02.112 --> 02:55:04.954]  This is the worst possible thing that could possibly happen.
[02:55:04.994 --> 02:55:06.495]  This is not going to make matters better.
[02:55:06.935 --> 02:55:09.377]  You're going to have a domestic intelligence agency.
[02:55:09.837 --> 02:55:13.759]  There was once another name for that in another country in another time.
[02:55:13.839 --> 02:55:15.800]  It was called the Gestapo.
[02:55:16.361 --> 02:55:16.821]  I hear you.
[02:55:16.881 --> 02:55:17.682]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:19.096 --> 02:55:20.196]  Andrea in New York.
[02:55:20.276 --> 02:55:20.897]  Last caller.
[02:55:20.917 --> 02:55:21.357]  Go ahead.
[02:55:21.677 --> 02:55:22.217]  Alex, hi.
[02:55:22.297 --> 02:55:23.217]  It's Andrea in New York.
[02:55:23.277 --> 02:55:23.837]  How are you?
[02:55:23.977 --> 02:55:24.237]  Great.
[02:55:24.297 --> 02:55:24.637]  Welcome.
[02:55:24.958 --> 02:55:25.518]  Hey, thanks.
[02:55:25.978 --> 02:55:37.501]  I wanted to add two points for your listeners, and it was a follow-up on the gentleman who was talking about Bamford who alerted me about Northwood right around the time of the Energy Task Force.
[02:55:38.121 --> 02:55:39.781]  I'd come back from the inauguration.
[02:55:39.841 --> 02:55:45.463]  I'd been a delegate for Senator McCain, and I'd been invited after having been a campaign contributor to the Republicans, but...
[02:55:46.226 --> 02:55:52.188]  To let folks know, Bamford's specifically targeted for empty ops by the intelligence goons.
[02:55:52.689 --> 02:56:03.893]  So this is how come he still sounds like an insider, even though he's been fairly observant with respect to some of the secret state stuff that the NSA and the CIA do.
[02:56:04.173 --> 02:56:07.815]  But he's just reporting what they've had a history of doing.
[02:56:08.175 --> 02:56:13.117]  Whether or not he's got the ability now to discern for our benefit
[02:56:13.812 --> 02:56:16.493]  And be permitted to go forward with that.
[02:56:16.553 --> 02:56:18.233]  You know, that's really questionable.
[02:56:18.293 --> 02:56:22.875]  They're really not going to let him be off the leash they've got him on.
[02:56:23.575 --> 02:56:24.035]  All right.
[02:56:24.255 --> 02:56:25.415]  Well, thanks for the call.
[02:56:25.475 --> 02:56:26.335]  We're out of time.
[02:56:26.396 --> 02:56:27.996]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight Central.
[02:56:28.036 --> 02:56:29.156]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:29.576 --> 02:56:31.397]  Get out there and expose the New World Order.
[02:56:31.757 --> 02:56:32.517]  God bless you all.
