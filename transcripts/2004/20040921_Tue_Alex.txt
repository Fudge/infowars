[00:00:05.716 --> 00:00:06.356]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.036 --> 00:00:08.077]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.797 --> 00:00:09.897]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.558 --> 00:00:11.378]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.118 --> 00:00:13.039]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:17.381]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:21.963]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.456 --> 00:00:36.837]  Here we are, my friends.
[00:00:36.917 --> 00:00:45.565]  It's already Tuesday, the 21st day of September 2004.
[00:00:46.165 --> 00:00:47.547]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:48.067 --> 00:00:49.869]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:52.030]  We've got a lot of big guests coming up this week.
[00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.755]  In the next hour, we've got the curator of the Andy Warhol Museum coming on.
[00:00:58.796 --> 00:01:02.940]  They've got some of the torture photos as an art display there.
[00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:17.575]  Now, of course, they're saying, hey, you show pictures of what happened in the Civil War, you show pictures of World War II, and they are shown in art museums, and you don't hear the veterans groups complaining.
[00:01:18.296 --> 00:01:23.398]  Why are they talking about this particular display?
[00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:35.162]  Now, I personally think the whole thing's a big fat distraction, but it is an exercise in double things, so we're going to be going over it for about 20 minutes in the next hour.
[00:01:35.622 --> 00:01:43.768]  For the balance of the broadcast, I just want to take calls, because some days I do a good job of taking 50 phone calls, most days I end up taking about 20.
[00:01:44.878 --> 00:01:48.119]  If I'm lucky, just because we're so busy covering news and having guests on.
[00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:50.700]  But we will go to your calls early in this hour.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:02:02.604]  Any issue you want to discuss, if you disagree with me, if you agree with me, if you have a question, a comment, a particular news item we haven't covered that you want to talk about, it'll be your chance to be heard by millions of people.
[00:02:03.985 --> 00:02:11.530]  And to get your information out there, 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.232]  Let's jump straight into the news.
[00:02:17.073 --> 00:02:19.474]  Zawari Group beheads U.S.
[00:02:19.755 --> 00:02:21.135]  hostage Armstrong.
[00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:31.762]  Now last week, they grabbed a Canadian journalist, head of a major magazine, major newspaper writer as well,
[00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:38.240]  And it was Iraqi police, and they handed him over to a group of men, and then they released him after threatening to cut his head off.
[00:02:39.441 --> 00:02:43.462]  And in so many other cases, it has intelligence agency written all over it.
[00:02:43.482 --> 00:02:44.962]  Well, now they've grabbed three people.
[00:02:44.982 --> 00:02:48.583]  They just supposedly cut the head off of one of them.
[00:02:48.623 --> 00:02:49.683]  It's a real tragedy.
[00:02:50.823 --> 00:02:51.744]  And who does this help?
[00:02:51.844 --> 00:02:52.824]  Who does this bolster?
[00:02:52.864 --> 00:02:53.684]  Who does this support?
[00:02:54.344 --> 00:02:56.985]  Well, you could say that it runs contractors out of the country.
[00:02:57.751 --> 00:03:01.614]  But overall, every time there's a beheading, poll numbers for the war actually go up.
[00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:01.874]  Why?
[00:03:01.914 --> 00:03:03.375]  They're cutting our people's heads off.
[00:03:03.795 --> 00:03:04.616]  They're evil.
[00:03:04.736 --> 00:03:05.477]  Let's stay in there.
[00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:06.357]  Let's go after them.
[00:03:07.818 --> 00:03:12.702]  And I'm just going off the available evidence, but it's all very, very suspicious.
[00:03:12.722 --> 00:03:13.722]  We'll get into that article.
[00:03:15.063 --> 00:03:17.165]  Also, press reports on U.S.
[00:03:17.225 --> 00:03:22.769]  casualties, about 17,000 short, United Press International says...
[00:03:24.187 --> 00:03:39.236]  Nearly 17,000 service members medically evacuated from Iraq and Afghanistan are absent from public Pentagon casualty reports commonly cited by newspapers, according to military data reviewed by United Press International.
[00:03:39.296 --> 00:03:41.337]  So we'll be covering that in more detail.
[00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.400]  GIs claim threat by Army.
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.702]  You know, this has been out for a few days, but it's important we should go over it.
[00:03:49.306 --> 00:04:01.515]  Colorado Springs, soldiers from Fort Carson Combat Unit say they have been issued an ultimatum, re-enlist for three more years or be transferred to other units expected to deploy to Iraq.
[00:04:03.736 --> 00:04:07.599]  So they're also doing stop-loss, which is a draft of people who've already served.
[00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:09.120]  Oh, you've got to stay in a few more years.
[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:16.565]  And with others, they're saying, voluntarily re-enlist or we're going to send you into combat again.
[00:04:18.006 --> 00:04:18.967]  Pretty vicious stuff.
[00:04:21.465 --> 00:04:24.146]  It's not like these are Bill Clinton-esque draft dodgers.
[00:04:24.626 --> 00:04:26.067]  These are people who've already served.
[00:04:26.407 --> 00:04:29.388]  Also, London terror evacuation plans found.
[00:04:29.528 --> 00:04:30.289]  Sky Television.
[00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:33.810]  Al-Qaeda will vote for Bush, says British Envoy.
[00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.292]  New York City scrambling to handle nuke strike.
[00:04:37.752 --> 00:04:38.592]  New York Post.
[00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:41.713]  Moscow car bomb suspect beaten to death by police.
[00:04:42.274 --> 00:04:44.335]  As usual, it's a submarine officer.
[00:04:45.595 --> 00:04:47.856]  Masked SWAT team storms wrong at home.
[00:04:47.896 --> 00:04:49.977]  Beats up 50-year-old liver transplant patient.
[00:04:50.911 --> 00:04:52.575]  Got a whole stack of news like this.
[00:04:52.615 --> 00:04:55.601]  We'll be covering it all and taking your calls at 1-800-259-9231, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:05:03.695 --> 00:05:09.177]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.597 --> 00:05:13.838]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:14.058 --> 00:05:21.100]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:27.582]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.722 --> 00:05:28.942]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.022 --> 00:05:29.603]  We're good to go.

[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.742]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:09.882 --> 00:07:14.303]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:07:14.323 --> 00:07:15.644]  The New World Order.
[00:07:17.425 --> 00:07:21.666]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:21.706 --> 00:07:28.649]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:28.769 --> 00:07:30.830]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:41.574]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:07:41.794 --> 00:07:44.195]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then
[00:07:44.275 --> 00:07:47.157]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:47.537 --> 00:07:49.019]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:17.208 --> 00:08:22.879]  We're now 8 minutes and 20 seconds into this first hour, second segment.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:29.112]  Thank you again for joining us, to all the affiliates, the sponsors, the listeners, the great folks running the broadcast.
[00:08:30.126 --> 00:08:35.728]  God bless you all for your courage and your defense of this republic and for checking out the information that we cover here.
[00:08:36.188 --> 00:08:42.370]  We want you to research our claims for yourself because when you find out it's true, you'll want to take action.
[00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:49.873]  You'll want to get involved if you love this country and your family and humankind and most importantly, if you love God.
[00:08:51.314 --> 00:08:58.196]  Let's plunge into the news and we'll go to Bill, Tom, John, Emmett and many, many others that are patiently holding.
[00:09:00.131 --> 00:09:02.073]  Zalari Group beheads U.S.
[00:09:02.133 --> 00:09:04.054]  hostage Armstrong Reuters.
[00:09:04.375 --> 00:09:16.324]  An Iraqi group led by Al-Qaeda ally Abu Zalari beheaded American Eugene Armstrong and posted a video of the killing on the Internet on Monday.
[00:09:17.185 --> 00:09:20.848]  The hostage's body was later recovered and identified, a U.S.
[00:09:20.908 --> 00:09:23.090]  official in Washington told Reuters.
[00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:24.211]  The video...
[00:09:24.935 --> 00:09:32.666]  Broadcast on an Islamist site showed a masked man sawing the construction contractor's head off with a knife.
[00:09:33.748 --> 00:09:36.492]  It also showed the banner of Zuwari's
[00:09:37.961 --> 00:09:48.028]  And Jihad Group, which said it had kidnapped him along with another American and a Briton from their house in central Baghdad on Thursday of last week.
[00:09:48.428 --> 00:09:51.891]  The other two now face death within 24 hours.
[00:09:52.351 --> 00:10:00.497]  In the video, five armed and masked men stood around the hostage who was blindfolded and dressed in orange overalls, typically of U.S.
[00:10:00.557 --> 00:10:05.300]  jails and associated around the world with images of Muslims detained at Guantanamo Bay.
[00:10:06.158 --> 00:10:12.947]  After reading a lengthy statement during which the hostage sat rocking on the floor, one of the men decapitated him.
[00:10:13.628 --> 00:10:19.956]  They said they had killed Armstrong because the US authorities had failed to free women prisoners in Iraqi jails.
[00:10:20.376 --> 00:10:23.160]  They gave another day for the United States to do so.
[00:10:24.798 --> 00:10:29.599]  Hensley and Britton Kenneth Bigley would also be killed.
[00:10:29.699 --> 00:10:31.800]  President Bush, however, vowed to keep up the pressure.
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:39.482]  Quote, we will stay on the offensive against them, he said, at an election event in Derry, New Hampshire, before the video.
[00:10:40.543 --> 00:10:42.863]  They will behead people in order to shake our will.
[00:10:42.883 --> 00:10:45.224]  These people are ideologues of hatred.
[00:10:46.678 --> 00:10:55.659]  Tawhid and Jihad said in an internet posting on Saturday would kill all three men unless Iraqi women were freed from Abu Ghraib and Umar Qasr jails.
[00:10:58.075 --> 00:10:58.475]  The U.S.
[00:10:58.515 --> 00:11:03.198]  military says no women are being held in the two prisons specified, but that two are in U.S.
[00:11:03.238 --> 00:11:05.599]  custody dubbed Dr. Germ and Ms.
[00:11:05.719 --> 00:11:06.279]  Anthrax.
[00:11:06.319 --> 00:11:07.760]  I love the names they've given.
[00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:08.821]  By U.S.
[00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:14.844]  forces, they are accused of working on Saddam Hussein's weapons programs and are in special prisons for high-profile detainees.
[00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:19.286]  Okay, let's just stop right there and try to analyze this article.
[00:11:21.329 --> 00:11:43.588]  All I know is that Nick Byrd, the first high-profile person that supposedly got their head chopped off, I say supposedly because the heads of major universities and forensic sciences in the U.S., Canada, England, and Australia have all looked at the video and said that person was either dead or it was a dummy because the blood didn't spray, the person didn't voluntarily flop or twitch.
[00:11:44.208 --> 00:11:47.951]  It's the same yellow walls, the same white chairs as Abu Ghraib.
[00:11:48.671 --> 00:11:49.852]  The guys are chubby.
[00:11:50.633 --> 00:11:54.715]  Zawari, who admittedly has one leg, they claim they've already killed four times.
[00:11:55.736 --> 00:11:57.477]  They never reversed those reports, by the way.
[00:11:58.178 --> 00:12:02.701]  Had both his legs in this and was throwing the body around, chopping the head off with ease.
[00:12:04.089 --> 00:12:14.355]  We have Nick Berg, obvious intelligence background, dropping out with an almost perfect grade point average out of an Ivy League school, traveling the world to help the poor with a high-tech bag of tricks.
[00:12:14.956 --> 00:12:19.238]  Then it turns out he's given his passcode laptop to two different hijackers.
[00:12:19.278 --> 00:12:23.381]  He's in Oklahoma at flight schools, hanging out with these people magically.
[00:12:24.301 --> 00:12:24.902]  He then...
[00:12:25.922 --> 00:12:33.284]  Owns the company Babylon Towers with the head of an Iraqi group funded by the State Department and the CIA publicly.
[00:12:34.244 --> 00:12:39.346]  A group caught shipping in drug paraphernalia and other stuff to the U.S.
[00:12:39.826 --> 00:12:42.506]  and, of course, white slaves out of Russia.
[00:12:42.546 --> 00:12:43.807]  This is all mainstream news.
[00:12:45.227 --> 00:12:51.429]  The guy is working at Abu Ghraib and then he gets grabbed by the FBI for 13 days.
[00:12:51.449 --> 00:12:52.109]  This is admitted.
[00:12:52.968 --> 00:12:54.809]  Associated Press, Reuters, BBC.
[00:12:54.929 --> 00:13:01.751]  They release him, and within hours he's in the hands of Al-Siaida Zavari, and then they supposedly cut his head off.
[00:13:02.632 --> 00:13:09.094]  I don't know what really happened, but I know their official story stinks to high heaven and has just hundreds of holes in it.
[00:13:09.814 --> 00:13:17.177]  And if I had to give you what my nose tells me, what my intellect and what the data tells me, like a police investigator would do...
[00:13:19.207 --> 00:13:24.188]  I know who the suspects are, and I would imagine Mr. Berg is alive and has had a face change and has been sheet-dipped.
[00:13:25.589 --> 00:13:28.989]  Tens of thousands of people have had their deaths staged in intelligence work.
[00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:35.911]  This is done routinely, and members of the family are allowed to know about it nowadays because they think the public's so stupid.
[00:13:35.931 --> 00:13:38.692]  I mean, this really cranked up in World War II.
[00:13:38.712 --> 00:13:43.833]  It went through Vietnam, right through... I mean, this is how the globalists operate.
[00:13:44.437 --> 00:13:44.877]  This is just 101.
[00:13:46.178 --> 00:13:47.918]  No, it's not a Robert Ludlam book.
[00:13:48.338 --> 00:13:49.639]  You know, The Bourne Supremacy.
[00:13:50.019 --> 00:13:51.319]  This is really how it's done.
[00:13:51.379 --> 00:13:54.000]  This guy fits the MO perfectly.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.221]  Now, do I think these other people are bashing in the Maui Sun?
[00:13:59.542 --> 00:14:02.683]  That's a line from The Running Man.
[00:14:04.276 --> 00:14:06.838]  No, my friends, I don't think they are.
[00:14:06.898 --> 00:14:09.059]  I think there are real beheadings going on.
[00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:13.242]  I think there are Muslim extremist groups, terror groups, that go around grabbing people, cutting their heads off.
[00:14:13.622 --> 00:14:17.865]  I think Saudi Arabians routinely shotgun Americans if they're caught outside their compounds.
[00:14:19.947 --> 00:14:22.048]  Or they pull you over and you've got a six-pack of beer.
[00:14:22.068 --> 00:14:23.489]  Do they blow your head off on the spot?
[00:14:23.569 --> 00:14:23.829]  Yes.
[00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:26.011]  Is this the freedom?
[00:14:26.091 --> 00:14:26.351]  No.
[00:14:27.592 --> 00:14:28.632]  This is the New World Order.
[00:14:28.692 --> 00:14:29.533]  This is our buddies.
[00:14:30.814 --> 00:14:31.034]  But...
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:40.888]  In these particular cases, every time poll numbers go down, somebody else gets their head cut off, and suddenly globalist poll numbers go up, and everybody's for the war.
[00:14:40.928 --> 00:14:42.549]  My gosh, they cut our guy's head off.
[00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:50.756]  It's like right after all the torture photos came out, suddenly there's this convenient beheading of Berg, and then, oh, see, torture's good.
[00:14:51.457 --> 00:14:56.061]  So it's all part of this marinating our souls in evil, training us to accept it.
[00:14:56.621 --> 00:14:59.224]  And then last week it came out that, again, they grabbed this...
[00:15:00.251 --> 00:15:03.253]  Canadian top journalist, magazine owner.
[00:15:04.514 --> 00:15:05.315]  They grab him.
[00:15:06.216 --> 00:15:07.517]  Iraqi police do.
[00:15:07.597 --> 00:15:12.521]  They take him to guys in black ski masks who claim that they're Al-Qaeda.
[00:15:12.541 --> 00:15:16.164]  And then they beat him up and release him.
[00:15:16.464 --> 00:15:17.745]  This is amazing, folks.
[00:15:17.925 --> 00:15:21.748]  And there was the case a few months ago, the bombing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
[00:15:22.068 --> 00:15:23.790]  The Saudis have got Al-Qaeda cornered.
[00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:25.891]  And then the CIA calls them and says release them.
[00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:27.012]  And they're allowed to flee.
[00:15:27.332 --> 00:15:29.114]  Same thing with the Russian school.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:35.364]  A few weeks ago, the reports are special forces ran out the back door and were allowed to leave.
[00:15:35.604 --> 00:15:38.706]  Then they had a bombing and machine gunned everybody trying to run out the front.
[00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:40.668]  Same thing with the theater siege.
[00:15:40.928 --> 00:15:45.591]  Putin was caught blowing up his own buildings, caught putting bombs in the fourth building in 99.
[00:15:46.052 --> 00:15:48.713]  I mean, we've caught these people doing this before.
[00:15:48.834 --> 00:15:51.155]  So when it happens again, we just don't know.
[00:15:51.535 --> 00:15:53.417]  It'll take time to find out as it develops.
[00:15:54.992 --> 00:15:56.273]  It's like with the Moscow school.
[00:15:56.313 --> 00:15:57.374]  We said, we'll see what happens.
[00:15:57.394 --> 00:16:04.340]  And then all these mainstream reports came out, and then most of the locals think the government did it, and people in Moscow think the government did it, and nobody's buying it.
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:16.649]  And then now you have, they supposedly foiled a car bomb on Putin's route in Moscow yesterday, and the police conveniently beat the Navy officer to death, who, by the way, was not Muslim.
[00:16:18.031 --> 00:16:19.712]  It was a white guy who wasn't Muslim.
[00:16:20.382 --> 00:16:23.144]  And they beat him to death in the interrogation.
[00:16:23.584 --> 00:16:31.369]  And he was a nuclear submarine officer, and he'd been paid, quote, to drive a car and just drop it off at a parking lot.
[00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:36.152]  And it turns out he might have been paid by the wife of a Chechnyan rebel.
[00:16:36.792 --> 00:16:42.696]  And so the police beat him to death, but not before getting the confession for the official story.
[00:16:42.756 --> 00:16:47.039]  And see, now this legitimizes the martial law that Putin is publicly setting up.
[00:16:48.744 --> 00:16:56.168]  Why is it always some army officer or some washout from special forces bombing buildings?
[00:16:57.149 --> 00:16:58.549]  It's the same M.O.
[00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:02.291]  over and over and over again.
[00:17:02.311 --> 00:17:06.093]  So what do you think about them apples?
[00:17:06.113 --> 00:17:06.834]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:17:06.854 --> 00:17:11.116]  We're going to break here in a minute.
[00:17:12.457 --> 00:17:13.337]  And we'll come back.
[00:17:15.158 --> 00:17:16.239]  And go straight to your calls.
[00:17:17.526 --> 00:17:18.787]  Press reports on U.S.
[00:17:18.807 --> 00:17:22.529]  casualties about 17,000 short, United Press International says.
[00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:36.038]  Nearly 17,000 service members medically evacuated from Iraq and Afghanistan are absent from public Pentagon casualty reports, commonly cited by newspapers, according to military data reviewed by United Press International.
[00:17:36.378 --> 00:17:42.702]  Most don't fit the definition of casualties, according to the Pentagon, but a veterans advocate said they should all be counted.
[00:17:43.082 --> 00:17:44.523]  The Pentagon has reported 1,019 dead.
[00:17:47.489 --> 00:17:49.851]  And 7,245 wounded from Iraq.
[00:17:49.871 --> 00:18:01.420]  The military has evacuated 16,765 individuals, service members, from Iraq and Afghanistan for injuries and ailments not related directly to combat.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.642]  According to U.S.
[00:18:03.682 --> 00:18:09.206]  Transportation Command, which is responsible for the medical evacuations, most are from Operation Iraqi Freedom.
[00:18:10.568 --> 00:18:13.550]  So a lot of cooking of the books going on there.
[00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:15.992]  Here's another frightening report.
[00:18:16.761 --> 00:18:19.702]  This is from the Rocky Mountain News.
[00:18:20.682 --> 00:18:23.303]  GIs claim threat by armies.
[00:18:23.443 --> 00:18:28.004]  Soldiers say they were told to re-enlist or face deployment to Iraq.
[00:18:28.464 --> 00:18:39.527]  Soldiers from a Fort Carson combat unit say they have been issued an ultimatum, re-enlist for three more years or be transferred to other units expected to deploy to Iraq.
[00:18:41.815 --> 00:18:43.636]  That's really kind of a death threat, isn't it?
[00:18:44.137 --> 00:18:51.081]  Well, you've already served for many years, so if you don't voluntarily reenlist, we're going to forcibly send you back to combat.
[00:18:53.462 --> 00:19:01.527]  I mean, you talk about criminal, you talk about extortion, you talk about racketeering, this fits the classical definition.
[00:19:02.466 --> 00:19:14.652]  Hundreds of soldiers from the 3rd Brigade Combat Team were presented with that message in a re-enlistment form in a series of assemblages last Thursday, said two soldiers who spoke on condition of anonymity.
[00:19:14.992 --> 00:19:16.973]  This has been in the news in other areas of the country.
[00:19:16.993 --> 00:19:17.873]  I've talked to a lot of troops.
[00:19:18.294 --> 00:19:19.354]  Has this happened to you?
[00:19:19.374 --> 00:19:22.996]  When you hear a caller hang up and we go to calls, call in.
[00:19:23.036 --> 00:19:23.756]  I want to hear from you.
[00:19:24.036 --> 00:19:30.079]  The effort is part of a restructuring of the Army into smaller, more flexible forces that can deploy rapidly around the world.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:31.180]  A fort...
[00:19:31.974 --> 00:19:35.955]  By the way, people that have gone ahead and signed back up voluntarily, they go ahead and send them to combat anyways.
[00:19:35.995 --> 00:19:36.856]  They lie to them, too.
[00:19:37.336 --> 00:19:44.398]  A Fort Carson spokeswoman confirmed that reenlistment drive is underway, and one of the soldiers provided the form to the Rocky Mountain News.
[00:19:44.758 --> 00:19:49.360]  An Army spokesman denied, however, that soldiers who don't reenlist with the brigade were threatened.
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:51.560]  Oh, sure.
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.641]  Just admittedly, you're doing this.
[00:19:54.481 --> 00:19:56.502]  So, I guess support the troops, huh?
[00:19:56.682 --> 00:19:57.642]  Use them as slaves.
[00:19:58.582 --> 00:19:59.843]  We'll be right back with your call.
[00:19:59.883 --> 00:20:00.283]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.477 --> 00:20:04.301]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[00:20:04.421 --> 00:20:05.262]  Michael Trudeau here.
[00:20:05.402 --> 00:20:08.686]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[00:20:08.887 --> 00:20:14.554]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[00:20:14.694 --> 00:20:17.718]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:22.240]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.341]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[00:20:24.461 --> 00:20:31.524]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again, with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[00:20:31.704 --> 00:20:34.205]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[00:20:34.485 --> 00:20:38.807]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice, only this time it changed my life.
[00:20:39.087 --> 00:20:41.588]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement, and after 12 weeks...
[00:20:42.088 --> 00:20:42.488]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[00:20:42.508 --> 00:20:43.228]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[00:20:43.248 --> 00:20:43.709]  It worked for me.
[00:21:01.355 --> 00:21:04.636]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:21:04.676 --> 00:21:08.877]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:21:09.097 --> 00:21:11.897]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:21:12.077 --> 00:21:14.498]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:21:14.678 --> 00:21:23.320]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:24.860]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:29.241]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:21:29.561 --> 00:21:30.062]  We're good to go.
[00:21:59.381 --> 00:21:59.862]  We're good to go.
[00:22:18.254 --> 00:22:18.794]  We're good to go.
[00:22:46.554 --> 00:22:47.995]  In business over 10 years.
[00:22:48.435 --> 00:22:52.617]  Make the call and see why the ultra-rich invest in gold and other precious metals.
[00:22:53.197 --> 00:22:54.718]  We'll rush you the free information.
[00:22:55.278 --> 00:22:55.778]  Call today.
[00:22:55.798 --> 00:22:55.858]  1-800-686-2237
[00:23:01.019 --> 00:23:02.540]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.860]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.441]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:23:07.561 --> 00:23:07.961]  Phenol?
[00:23:08.302 --> 00:23:15.404]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:23:15.704 --> 00:23:19.805]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:23:19.925 --> 00:23:20.386]  Fragrance?
[00:23:20.746 --> 00:23:25.527]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:23:25.647 --> 00:23:30.249]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:33.111]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[00:23:33.351 --> 00:23:36.773]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:23:36.933 --> 00:23:40.496]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:23:40.676 --> 00:23:43.017]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:23:43.197 --> 00:23:44.078]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:23:44.198 --> 00:23:53.945]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.
[00:23:54.145 --> 00:23:56.626]  Call Cal-Ben toll free, 1-800-340-7091 or visit CalBenPureSoap.com.
[00:24:04.515 --> 00:24:07.881]  Alright, we're going to your calls here momentarily.
[00:24:07.901 --> 00:24:14.411]  Then when we get back, I'm going to go through London terror evacuation plans found.
[00:24:15.743 --> 00:24:25.865]  But months ago, actually over a year ago, it came out about rest and relaxation centers, rest and relocation centers, giant martial law plans, all part of the new freedom.
[00:24:26.485 --> 00:24:29.666]  Also, Al-Qaeda will vote for Bush, says British envoy.
[00:24:29.706 --> 00:24:30.406]  Pretty ridiculous.
[00:24:31.486 --> 00:24:35.327]  Also, New York City scrambling to handle nuke strike.
[00:24:35.487 --> 00:24:38.267]  New York Post, more fear-mongering for martial law.
[00:24:39.247 --> 00:24:42.888]  More on that Moscow car bomb suspect beaten to death by police.
[00:24:43.792 --> 00:24:50.315]  And Masked SWAT Team Storms Wrong Home Beats Up 50-Year-Old Liver Transplant Patient.
[00:24:51.295 --> 00:24:54.656]  By the way, we see one of these articles on average about every two or three days.
[00:24:55.517 --> 00:24:57.177]  But I figured we'd cover this one today.
[00:24:58.938 --> 00:25:11.123]  Also, we'll get into Al-Qaeda Scene Planning for Spectacular Attack and Heckling a Yankees Fan Landed Editor in a Baltimore Prison Hell.
[00:25:11.932 --> 00:25:14.054]  That's the headline from World Tribune.
[00:25:14.074 --> 00:25:18.278]  Also, we're back at war with Iraq, says General.
[00:25:18.318 --> 00:25:19.359]  That's just some of what's coming up.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.122]  Let's just talk to Bill in St.
[00:25:22.202 --> 00:25:23.203]  Louis, Missouri.
[00:25:23.263 --> 00:25:23.903]  Go ahead, Bill.
[00:25:24.124 --> 00:25:24.784]  How are you doing?
[00:25:25.045 --> 00:25:25.325]  Good.
[00:25:25.905 --> 00:25:32.171]  Alex, listen, yesterday you had a phone call from a Christopher.
[00:25:33.733 --> 00:25:37.016]  He called and he wanted to know what can be done by the average citizen.
[00:25:38.191 --> 00:25:38.491]  Yes.
[00:25:38.511 --> 00:25:51.617]  There's a quote by Edmund Burke that says the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.
[00:25:53.638 --> 00:25:54.638]  I'm mad about this.
[00:25:54.718 --> 00:25:55.859]  I've known about this.
[00:25:55.919 --> 00:25:57.900]  I've been listening to you for a long time now.
[00:25:58.801 --> 00:26:02.723]  And everybody tells you, you can't do nothing.
[00:26:02.743 --> 00:26:03.643]  There's nothing you can do.
[00:26:03.663 --> 00:26:05.064]  Why get yourself upset?
[00:26:05.104 --> 00:26:06.165]  You're going to have a heart attack.
[00:26:06.185 --> 00:26:09.126]  You're going to drive yourself crazy with this stuff.
[00:26:09.166 --> 00:26:18.710]  Well, I'm mad and I can't just sit back and let them freely trample all over America and everything it ever stood for.
[00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:21.712]  So you've been an inspiration to me.
[00:26:21.812 --> 00:26:23.873]  I've got your film, American Dictators.
[00:26:25.378 --> 00:26:30.900]  I've made arrangements to show it at the public library system here in St.
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:31.200]  Louis.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.220]  Oh, thank you.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:38.042]  I'm getting it broadcast on the local public cable, local access.
[00:26:38.422 --> 00:26:39.742]  That's really exciting.
[00:26:39.922 --> 00:26:40.422]  Isn't that good?
[00:26:41.062 --> 00:26:47.484]  And I'm forming a citizens group where we'll meet weekly or bi-weekly or monthly.
[00:26:47.504 --> 00:26:48.804]  I haven't decided that yet.
[00:26:49.325 --> 00:26:50.625]  But we're going to share news.
[00:26:51.274 --> 00:26:54.321]  From InfoWars, we're going to try to educate people.
[00:26:54.341 --> 00:26:57.508]  I'm going to order more of your films, and I'm going to get them...
[00:26:59.016 --> 00:27:09.700]  In a library system and on a TV and in people's homes and... Well, Bill, I mean, I want to commend you, but that's really the key.
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.260]  It's not going, man, look at the size of that thing.
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.201]  How can we fight it?
[00:27:13.561 --> 00:27:14.521]  How can we defeat it?
[00:27:15.081 --> 00:27:17.542]  It's just picking up a shovel and start digging.
[00:27:18.242 --> 00:27:21.564]  I mean, it's like that when I want to clean out my garage once every two years.
[00:27:21.604 --> 00:27:23.224]  I'm like, oh, I'll never get this done.
[00:27:23.244 --> 00:27:25.485]  And two, three hours later, it's done.
[00:27:26.152 --> 00:27:28.213]  Or, you know, it's like cleaning your house or something.
[00:27:28.653 --> 00:27:36.736]  You can procrastinate and procrastinate, but the best news I've got for people is that we really can affect change.
[00:27:36.756 --> 00:27:38.657]  We really can have victories.
[00:27:38.737 --> 00:27:48.221]  And if we weren't here fighting corruption and being involved, and if people like yourself weren't out there being leaders, things would be much, much worse right now.
[00:27:49.282 --> 00:27:49.562]  Oh, yeah.
[00:27:50.242 --> 00:27:50.502]  Oh, yeah.
[00:27:50.882 --> 00:27:52.443]  So can I give it a little plug here?
[00:27:52.463 --> 00:27:54.964]  Can I go ahead and plug it here for people in St.
[00:27:54.984 --> 00:27:55.104]  Louis?
[00:27:55.124 --> 00:27:55.224]  Sure.
[00:27:56.093 --> 00:27:59.035]  All you folks out there living in St.
[00:27:59.075 --> 00:28:04.880]  Louis, we're a free showing of American Dictators at the St.
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:09.564]  Louis County Library, the Bridgeton Trails branch on McKelvey Road.
[00:28:09.624 --> 00:28:13.847]  This will be on Wednesday, October 6th at 6.30 p.m.
[00:28:14.488 --> 00:28:20.372]  It's presented by Concern for the Future of America, CFA.
[00:28:20.973 --> 00:28:21.713]  If you're in St.
[00:28:21.753 --> 00:28:24.996]  Louis and you want to get involved, here's your opportunity.
[00:28:26.209 --> 00:28:38.792]  Call this number, 291-1139, and join us, because we're not going to sit idly by and let these people, let these criminals, get away with what they're doing.
[00:28:39.012 --> 00:28:40.192]  All right, good to hear from you.
[00:28:40.252 --> 00:28:40.732]  Thanks.
[00:28:40.812 --> 00:28:41.832]  That's exciting, Bill.
[00:28:42.533 --> 00:28:44.633]  That's coming up the 6th of October.
[00:28:45.153 --> 00:28:46.653]  Tom in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:28:46.713 --> 00:28:47.154]  Go ahead.
[00:28:48.134 --> 00:28:49.234]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[00:28:49.614 --> 00:28:51.274]  I guess I really need some help here.
[00:28:51.294 --> 00:28:53.755]  I've been...
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:29:00.023]  I've talked to you before about some things, and I guess I'm one of your first.
[00:29:00.243 --> 00:29:04.105]  I'm an ancient Alex Jones or something from back in the 70s and 80s.
[00:29:05.786 --> 00:29:11.149]  I brought this stuff up to my dad just recently.
[00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:14.031]  I've been doing this for years anyway, but I brought this up to him.
[00:29:15.412 --> 00:29:19.735]  I put you on cassette tape, a lot of your stuff.
[00:29:20.075 --> 00:29:20.955]  I'm out of a job.
[00:29:21.716 --> 00:29:24.638]  I lost my wife over all this stuff.
[00:29:24.678 --> 00:29:25.278]  I just got...
[00:29:25.973 --> 00:29:28.374]  Well, I just got divorced here about two months ago.
[00:29:28.975 --> 00:29:30.055]  He thought I was a freaking nut.
[00:29:31.196 --> 00:29:32.177]  You're ruining my child.
[00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:34.898]  I had an eight-year-old daughter and everything.
[00:29:36.619 --> 00:29:41.662]  Anyway, I told my dad about the cell phone deal, about the 9-11, the planes.
[00:29:41.702 --> 00:29:45.984]  He says, by God, son, that boy's brainwashing you.
[00:29:46.305 --> 00:29:47.185]  Tell you what, stay there.
[00:29:47.245 --> 00:29:47.906]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.736 --> 00:29:52.639]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.141 --> 00:29:54.725]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.668 --> 00:29:58.336]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:09.262]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:09.682 --> 00:30:13.923]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:30:14.143 --> 00:30:21.185]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:21.565 --> 00:30:27.667]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:27.807 --> 00:30:29.027]  There are no side effects.
[00:30:29.267 --> 00:30:29.587]  I think.
[00:30:46.141 --> 00:30:49.282]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[00:30:49.302 --> 00:30:49.402]  866-885-6625.
[00:30:49.422 --> 00:30:49.502]  866-885-6625.
[00:30:49.582 --> 00:30:50.583]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:30:50.603 --> 00:30:50.803]  Call today.
[00:31:01.189 --> 00:31:08.716]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:31:08.996 --> 00:31:19.906]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:31:20.166 --> 00:31:20.386]  I think.
[00:31:36.656 --> 00:31:37.156]  That's right.
[00:31:37.336 --> 00:31:44.439]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:31:44.739 --> 00:31:53.482]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:53.502 --> 00:31:53.982]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.385 --> 00:32:02.485]  Are you a diabetic?
[00:32:02.565 --> 00:32:03.886]  Do you know someone who is?
[00:32:03.946 --> 00:32:07.567]  Well, here's some great news that can save you time and money.
[00:32:07.847 --> 00:32:13.869]  If you are required to test your blood sugar, Medicare and Medicaid may pay for your diabetes testing supplies.
[00:32:14.129 --> 00:32:18.230]  And if that's of interest to you, you need to know about Artex Medical.
[00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:22.712]  We'll ship your diabetes supplies right to your door at no cost to you.
[00:32:23.172 --> 00:32:29.874]  And we work with Medicare and Medicaid and even most private insurances to determine your maximum coverage benefits.
[00:32:30.094 --> 00:32:32.556]  Call now to confirm your eligibility.
[00:32:32.576 --> 00:32:33.096]  800-419-2335.
[00:32:34.857 --> 00:32:43.323]  Again, we are Artex Medical, and our commitment to you is to save you time, money, and hassles on receiving your diabetes testing supplies.
[00:32:43.603 --> 00:32:46.145]  There are no membership fees, no shipping costs.
[00:32:46.445 --> 00:32:49.427]  We even file all the insurance claims, so call 24 hours a day.
[00:32:49.447 --> 00:32:49.487]  800-419-2335.
[00:32:59.974 --> 00:33:05.057]  You know, the mainstream media...
[00:33:21.096 --> 00:33:24.818]  Admittedly is out there trying to propagandize and brainwash people.
[00:33:24.898 --> 00:33:30.741]  The sitcoms, the dramas, the movies are just full of conditioning and political correctness.
[00:33:32.262 --> 00:33:34.843]  Nobody can deny this if they're really honest with themselves.
[00:33:34.923 --> 00:33:38.786]  But some people, when you present them with the facts, go, Oh, you're being brainwashed.
[00:33:38.826 --> 00:33:40.126]  I'm not even going to check that out.
[00:33:42.067 --> 00:33:43.428]  And I warn people.
[00:33:44.268 --> 00:33:48.851]  I've found statistically it's even harder to wake up your own family, your neighbors.
[00:33:49.426 --> 00:33:58.988]  You know, a prophet isn't known in his own country because they have preconceived notions about you and they think you're trying to put them down by giving them information and warning them.
[00:33:59.848 --> 00:34:04.069]  A salesman will tell you it's easier to sell a complete stranger than it is your own family.
[00:34:04.949 --> 00:34:17.832]  And so, you know, if your wife or your husband or your neighbor or your father or mother doesn't want to hear this stuff and wants to laugh at you or call you crazy, I don't want to say pearls before swine because it's your family, but just move on.
[00:34:18.664 --> 00:34:19.785]  Move on.
[00:34:19.945 --> 00:34:23.548]  And if somebody wants to debate with you and wants to debate facts, that's good.
[00:34:24.189 --> 00:34:26.771]  But if they want to just laugh at you or say you're crazy, move on.
[00:34:27.192 --> 00:34:29.994]  I mean, we document everything we talk about here.
[00:34:31.475 --> 00:34:32.937]  We talk about how vaccines...
[00:34:33.937 --> 00:34:39.861]  Are full of mercury and full of cancer viruses and full of weird hormones that sterilize and brain damage.
[00:34:39.901 --> 00:34:46.125]  And every day we read some new mainstream medical report or article where it says just that.
[00:34:46.185 --> 00:34:53.129]  I mean, I'm a kook who 10 years ago was saying that Prozac causes accelerated risk of suicide.
[00:34:53.970 --> 00:34:59.133]  I got it because it was public that in 83 with the trials of Prozac, that came out.
[00:34:59.273 --> 00:35:00.474]  I mean, it's not like we're
[00:35:01.269 --> 00:35:03.189]  Reinventing the wheel here every day.
[00:35:03.309 --> 00:35:04.170]  This is what I do.
[00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:05.050]  This is my job.
[00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:05.890]  I study this.
[00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.950]  I look at this.
[00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:16.732]  But going back to Tom in Texas, he says that he showed some information to his father, and his father said, you're being brainwashed.
[00:35:17.332 --> 00:35:20.592]  You brought up cell phones.
[00:35:21.393 --> 00:35:23.013]  What specifically were you telling your father?
[00:35:23.033 --> 00:35:29.634]  Well, I was trying to tell him about the... A younger brother was there, and he's in his late 20s, and...
[00:35:30.552 --> 00:35:36.817]  I'm 46, and I said, look, Dad, I had a grandfather that told me about this stuff back in 77.
[00:35:37.038 --> 00:35:44.664]  Before he died, he said it just like this, quote, he says, it's the Nazis you need to worry about, not the communists.
[00:35:45.745 --> 00:35:49.468]  And he says, I fought in World War I. He says, I've seen what's going on.
[00:35:49.508 --> 00:35:51.630]  We've got infiltration of Nazis in our government.
[00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:56.194]  Of course, our family looks at him like, boy, you're really, you know, he's getting old and he's getting seen up.
[00:35:57.213 --> 00:35:58.153]  Well, I took what he said.
[00:35:58.173 --> 00:35:58.654]  It was real.
[00:35:58.694 --> 00:36:01.095]  And I went to the libraries and started checking things out and stuff.
[00:36:02.035 --> 00:36:03.416]  And here's what he said.
[00:36:03.436 --> 00:36:13.500]  He said, the first thing that's going to happen in the next 20 years after I'm dead and gone, he said, you're going to have a Nazi-speaking president, I mean a German-speaking president, in the White House.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:17.742]  You're going to have equivalent to the White House being burned down.
[00:36:18.102 --> 00:36:21.003]  They're going to call out the brown troopers.
[00:36:21.875 --> 00:36:26.177]  And he named it all the way down to a T. The Wall will go down in Germany first.
[00:36:26.197 --> 00:36:28.258]  Was your grandfather in intelligence?
[00:36:29.058 --> 00:36:29.678]  I don't know.
[00:36:29.938 --> 00:36:32.900]  He was a passmore from Nacogdoches, and I don't know.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.821]  But he was so on the money, it was just unbelievable.
[00:36:37.381 --> 00:36:38.942]  So what I did, he died in 77.
[00:36:39.202 --> 00:36:44.024]  Then in 1988, I was, of course, keeping up this stuff in between nine and ten years there.
[00:36:45.205 --> 00:36:48.586]  And I started going to libraries and checking stuff out that he had mentioned to me.
[00:36:49.226 --> 00:36:50.907]  And I went to a
[00:36:51.733 --> 00:36:59.323]  I told you about this before, Alex, and I know it sounds unreal, but I went to a seminar with Tex Mars and the Constance Combine.
[00:36:59.423 --> 00:37:01.206]  No, no, I talked to Tex.
[00:37:01.266 --> 00:37:03.048]  This story you're about to tell is documented.
[00:37:03.088 --> 00:37:04.450]  Before you go any further... Yes, sir?
[00:37:06.241 --> 00:37:08.162]  Oh, man, I'm glad you found that.
[00:37:08.182 --> 00:37:10.104]  Let me just tell folks something.
[00:37:10.424 --> 00:37:14.388]  I mean, it's choking me up because everybody thinks I'm freaking crazy.
[00:37:14.668 --> 00:37:16.610]  No, I understand, but just hold on a second, Tom.
[00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:17.631]  Let me give them some background.
[00:37:18.071 --> 00:37:25.538]  In the new film we're making, we detail off congressional documents, Library of Congress, how the Bushes...
[00:37:26.719 --> 00:37:28.341]  We're good to go.
[00:37:41.697 --> 00:37:43.438]  And that's why they love Arnold.
[00:37:43.478 --> 00:37:44.759]  That's why the media loves Arnold.
[00:37:44.799 --> 00:37:48.281]  That's why it doesn't matter if Arnold campaigns for Nazis in Austria.
[00:37:48.301 --> 00:37:50.342]  That's why he can say he loves Hitler.
[00:37:50.802 --> 00:37:51.643]  Oh, that's good.
[00:37:51.843 --> 00:37:53.044]  That's a pro-Jewish thing.
[00:37:53.884 --> 00:37:55.405]  That's why it's so crazy.
[00:37:55.905 --> 00:38:01.008]  And that's why they've got the 22nd Amendment now on the rocks, trying to get rid of it, so he can be president.
[00:38:01.028 --> 00:38:02.629]  That's the Associated Press, by the way, folks.
[00:38:03.029 --> 00:38:06.771]  So all of this is happening, and it's part of a bigger picture.
[00:38:07.492 --> 00:38:11.114]  But tell folks the other information.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:13.060]  Yes, sir.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.641]  Well, I was in 1988.
[00:38:14.701 --> 00:38:18.943]  What I did, I was Constance Convey and Alex, I mean, Tex Mars.
[00:38:18.984 --> 00:38:22.786]  They had a big seminar at the Holiday Inn at the Hobby Airport.
[00:38:23.906 --> 00:38:25.667]  And, well, I went to it.
[00:38:26.167 --> 00:38:30.330]  Well, during this time, before that, three or four months earlier, I was working for You All Movers World.
[00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:39.735]  And at the time, we were, I don't remember the exact street where all this happened, but I had, what I did, I did do this.
[00:38:39.875 --> 00:38:41.936]  I got the bill of laden.
[00:38:42.546 --> 00:38:46.170]  And I copied it, or either I gave it to Tex Mars.
[00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:46.830]  No, he has it.
[00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:47.091]  I know.
[00:38:47.131 --> 00:38:47.591]  I talked to him.
[00:38:47.611 --> 00:38:48.452]  But go ahead and tell the story.
[00:38:48.492 --> 00:38:49.913]  Oh, great, because I don't have it.
[00:38:49.954 --> 00:38:50.955]  Go ahead and tell the story, sir.
[00:38:50.975 --> 00:38:52.476]  We don't have a lot of time.
[00:38:52.596 --> 00:38:52.957]  I know.
[00:38:53.277 --> 00:38:59.743]  And so we drive on this nine-bus convoy to go all the way out to this church.
[00:39:00.844 --> 00:39:02.766]  And it's a long, drawn-out road.
[00:39:02.806 --> 00:39:03.627]  I mean, like a snake road.
[00:39:03.647 --> 00:39:04.228]  We get out there.
[00:39:04.744 --> 00:39:06.726]  And this old man comes out, all hunched over.
[00:39:06.746 --> 00:39:10.108]  He says, we're in a blankety-blank's bin.
[00:39:10.429 --> 00:39:11.169]  It took us four hours.
[00:39:11.209 --> 00:39:12.010]  We're four hours late.
[00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:12.530]  We get there.
[00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:17.374]  He says, well, y'all come on in here, and I'll be doggone right.
[00:39:17.754 --> 00:39:24.580]  I mean, it's this gigantic cathedral building, metal skin on the outside, but inside it's just a huge, gigantic door.
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:31.205]  You looked up, and the first thing you saw, which was like, I'd have to say 80 feet away from the door,
[00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:46.780]  Was this gigantic, the swastika flag, had a blue field, kind of a baby blue field, a sky blue field, with a white swastika and a small little red cross at the bottom of it.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:47.801]  I'll never forget it.
[00:39:48.702 --> 00:39:49.662]  And everybody just went with it.
[00:39:49.682 --> 00:39:50.743]  We got nine guys with me.
[00:39:50.763 --> 00:39:52.744]  They said, good, got their mouths opened up and everything.
[00:39:53.265 --> 00:39:54.546]  There's this one guy like Truman.
[00:39:54.566 --> 00:39:58.248]  He was just talking about Truman stuff when we were driving up there.
[00:39:58.268 --> 00:40:00.830]  He was talking about World War II and stuff when we got there.
[00:40:01.664 --> 00:40:06.527]  And so this old man goes, Do you know whose church this is?
[00:40:07.568 --> 00:40:09.829]  And I said, well, so I started playing dumb.
[00:40:09.889 --> 00:40:11.450]  I didn't want him freaking out on us.
[00:40:11.511 --> 00:40:12.691]  I said, well, no, what is it?
[00:40:12.711 --> 00:40:13.612]  This is cool, you know?
[00:40:14.392 --> 00:40:18.335]  Anyway, so this is George Herbert Bush's church.
[00:40:18.855 --> 00:40:22.137]  And this is a true Christian symbol up there and all this kind of crap.
[00:40:22.638 --> 00:40:26.720]  So we go into the, he says, I'm going to show you something, all y'all something.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:30.523]  We go into the back foyer, I mean, back hallway, and this long hallway, there's this,
[00:40:31.041 --> 00:40:36.645]  These offices, little offices, I mean real decked out chairs and everything, plush and everything.
[00:40:36.965 --> 00:40:41.389]  And there's George Bush's pictures, a whole nine yards of them all the way around the whole room.
[00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:44.511]  And I said, my God, check this out.
[00:40:45.832 --> 00:40:52.417]  And anyway, I'm taking all this in, you know, and this guy, of course, he's cussing like a sailor.
[00:40:52.457 --> 00:40:53.478]  I said, who are you anyway?
[00:40:53.498 --> 00:40:55.119]  He said, I'm the deacon in this church.
[00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:58.771]  I thought, man, this dude cuts like a sailor.
[00:40:59.332 --> 00:41:01.773]  I could not believe what I saw.
[00:41:01.993 --> 00:41:05.175]  This whole thing, well, when I came back home, I told Dad about the incident.
[00:41:07.077 --> 00:41:07.957]  He didn't believe me.
[00:41:07.997 --> 00:41:09.058]  Nobody believed me.
[00:41:10.159 --> 00:41:11.600]  The whole thing was just unbelievable.
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:15.082]  No, sir, I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[00:41:16.563 --> 00:41:21.025]  And if you ever want to go back out and find that place and you want to go out there with me, I'll come down and do it.
[00:41:21.065 --> 00:41:22.747]  But let me just say this about it.
[00:41:24.295 --> 00:41:25.476]  I don't know if this story is true.
[00:41:25.516 --> 00:41:26.117]  I talked to Tex.
[00:41:26.177 --> 00:41:31.200]  He did get the copy of this from this gentleman and did some background on it, and it seems to think it's documented.
[00:41:31.281 --> 00:41:49.655]  But what I do know is that MSNBC, Associated Press, Reuters, New York Observer, have all reported that inside the tomb at Skull and Bones at Yale, which was founded publicly by the Illuminati, we played the BBC report last week,
[00:41:51.252 --> 00:41:58.818]  That inside there, they have Nazi flags, they eat off Hitler's silverware, they do these Nazi death chants.
[00:41:58.838 --> 00:42:05.243]  You know, the symbol on the door is the skull and crossbones, the same thing that the SS officers wore on their hats and on their lapels.
[00:42:06.964 --> 00:42:11.188]  And I know that at Bohemian Grove, it's very Germanic, and there's a lot of this symbolism.
[00:42:13.787 --> 00:42:20.093]  And so what you're saying about a church in Houston just fits into it, because that's where the Bushes live, nearby where you're mentioning.
[00:42:20.593 --> 00:42:28.540]  And I know that my grandfather worked in the oil business, and he said that all over West Texas, especially in Midland, there were just Nazis everywhere.
[00:42:30.839 --> 00:42:32.220]  You know, they'd be strutting around in U.S.
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.560]  military uniforms, you name it.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:45.765]  Texas, South Texas, West Texas, was the hub in between Argentina, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and all these tens of thousands of Nazis and all the big Nazi wealth going through the Bush's hands.
[00:42:45.885 --> 00:42:52.248]  And the Bushes were going back serving the Nazis with Fritz Thyssen all the way back to 1923.
[00:42:53.788 --> 00:42:55.249]  The Walkers were involved as well.
[00:42:57.046 --> 00:42:58.729]  So those are facts.
[00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:07.201]  And so what you're saying doesn't sound that wild or crazy when you know, because this is what they're into.
[00:43:08.403 --> 00:43:10.446]  And it's very frightening.
[00:43:11.454 --> 00:43:15.196]  You know, the Thule Society, the Thule Society, this all goes back.
[00:43:15.697 --> 00:43:17.478]  You know, Hitler didn't invent the swastika.
[00:43:17.498 --> 00:43:18.819]  He didn't invent the black uniform.
[00:43:18.839 --> 00:43:20.079]  He didn't invent the death's head.
[00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:26.283]  These are the uniforms that these Luciferian black magic followers wear.
[00:43:26.343 --> 00:43:27.864]  This is their outfit.
[00:43:29.225 --> 00:43:32.667]  And Arnold Schwarzenegger is a member of Bohemian Grove.
[00:43:32.687 --> 00:43:34.748]  I mean, it's the same M.O.
[00:43:34.909 --> 00:43:36.269]  over and over again, Tom.
[00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:40.332]  And I'm sorry that some of your family cannot face up to reality.
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.161]  Let's talk to John in Ohio.
[00:43:43.261 --> 00:43:44.141]  John, go ahead.
[00:43:45.021 --> 00:43:51.084]  Alex, I have to make my examples to make my points, so I hope I'll be able to make that before you.
[00:43:51.104 --> 00:43:51.484]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:43:51.504 --> 00:43:52.264]  We've got a lot of callers.
[00:43:52.284 --> 00:43:53.384]  I want to be fair to them, but go ahead.
[00:43:54.085 --> 00:44:05.389]  Well, the point that the previous caller made, I think, is apropos of a lot of things I've said when he said, don't worry about the communists, worry about the Nazi fascists, because I do believe that anti-communist propaganda is the ideology.
[00:44:06.071 --> 00:44:13.774]  And the propaganda of these neocon fascist globalists in the military industrial complex that fuels all of their wars and their militarism.
[00:44:14.234 --> 00:44:22.598]  And I do admire the good work you're doing in exposing the lies and disinformation of this gang and their government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:44:23.238 --> 00:44:33.862]  But I think that on certain occasions you're being very inconsistent, and I think it's a great danger that it's going to put you on the side of supporting these very same corporate globalists
[00:44:34.457 --> 00:44:45.701]  And fascist neocons in the military and industrial complex, whenever they rep their war-mongering lies and police state pretext in anti-communist instead of anti-terrorist labels and propaganda.
[00:44:46.181 --> 00:45:03.088]  And these same neocon fascists around the Bush administration, when they were in the Reagan-Bush administration, used anti-communist pretext to justify their support for terrorism, slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people in Central and Latin America,
[00:45:03.616 --> 00:45:04.797]  And in Afghanistan.
[00:45:05.177 --> 00:45:15.482]  And I think that these death squad regimes, the support for the Al-Qaeda, CIA terrorists, was all done within the rationale and pretext of anti-communism.
[00:45:15.522 --> 00:45:28.688]  And I was listening to a couple of brief comments you made, I think it was August 12th and September 13th, and I think they had very dangerous implications because, in effect, what you were saying is you thought it was a good idea
[00:45:29.093 --> 00:45:40.475]  For Brzezinski and the CIA to spend billions in creating, arming, training, and instigating these LCI cicada types to perpetrate a terrorist war against an Afghan government that was trying to bring... I never said that.
[00:45:40.515 --> 00:45:42.116]  How dare you?
[00:45:42.136 --> 00:45:44.116]  I never said that when General Park was on.
[00:45:44.716 --> 00:45:46.817]  How dare you use that disinformation tactic?
[00:45:46.837 --> 00:45:47.857]  That was before that.
[00:45:47.937 --> 00:45:48.817]  That was before that.
[00:45:49.137 --> 00:45:50.177]  I never said that.
[00:45:50.197 --> 00:45:50.938]  A brief comment.
[00:45:50.998 --> 00:45:55.639]  You said, in a brief aside, you said that it was a good idea to arm these...
[00:45:58.129 --> 00:46:01.491]  Mujahideen in Afghanistan, long before Parton was on.
[00:46:01.511 --> 00:46:08.534]  You know, I don't remember saying that, but I mean, obviously it's good to stand up against the Soviets, but don't sit there and imply that I'm blah, blah, blah.
[00:46:08.834 --> 00:46:11.295]  Look, just stay there for a second.
[00:46:11.315 --> 00:46:12.576]  I want to read you a quote, okay?
[00:46:12.596 --> 00:46:13.796]  I'm going to try to deprogram you.
[00:46:14.477 --> 00:46:15.457]  All right?
[00:46:15.657 --> 00:46:16.698]  Just hold on a second.
[00:46:16.718 --> 00:46:17.538]  Let me read this to you.
[00:46:18.779 --> 00:46:27.363]  There does exist and has existed for a generation an international network which operates to some extent in the way the radical right believes the communists act.
[00:46:28.118 --> 00:46:37.066]  In fact, this network, which we may identify as the Round Table Groups, has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists and or any other group and frequently does so.
[00:46:37.707 --> 00:46:46.936]  I know the operations of this network because I have studied it for 20 years and was permitted for two years in the early 1960s to examine its papers and secret records.
[00:46:47.496 --> 00:46:53.582]  I have no aversion to it or most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it in many of its instruments.
[00:46:54.122 --> 00:46:58.085]  I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies.
[00:46:58.486 --> 00:47:02.669]  But in general, my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown.
[00:47:03.009 --> 00:47:07.053]  And I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.
[00:47:07.533 --> 00:47:17.020]  That was the head of Georgetown Political Science, Bill Clinton's mentor, who in his own book, 900 Pages, Tragedy and Hope, 1966, Professor Carol Quigley.
[00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:20.003]  Now, listen.
[00:47:20.043 --> 00:47:20.964]  You've got to talk.
[00:47:20.984 --> 00:47:22.645]  Now let me talk for a second.
[00:47:23.999 --> 00:47:24.860]  The globalists.
[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:26.060]  I've got the documents.
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:26.881]  It's admitted.
[00:47:27.141 --> 00:47:28.862]  Funded the Communist Revolution.
[00:47:28.962 --> 00:47:31.904]  British intelligence wanted to bring down their cousins, the czars.
[00:47:32.424 --> 00:47:36.327]  They needed to have an enemy to build up a police state in the West.
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:45.242]  Well, at the same time, the communist system they control could take over more land for the empire, and the empire could act like it wasn't part of it.
[00:47:45.823 --> 00:47:46.203]  Okay?
[00:47:46.283 --> 00:47:48.783]  Well, look, I can't... Let me just finish here.
[00:47:49.224 --> 00:47:49.584]  Okay?
[00:47:49.784 --> 00:47:51.164]  I don't like fascism.
[00:47:51.304 --> 00:47:52.424]  I don't like communism.
[00:47:52.584 --> 00:48:00.867]  I don't like command and control, period, whether it's a red star or a swastika on a blue field or a black field.
[00:48:00.947 --> 00:48:04.888]  It's all command and control, and these ideologies are anti-freedom.
[00:48:05.268 --> 00:48:06.208]  An anti-God!
[00:48:06.348 --> 00:48:13.451]  Well, what I'm saying, though, is you can't support Al-Qaeda just on the basis that they were doing so, their terrorism on an anti-communist basis.
[00:48:13.491 --> 00:48:19.033]  You can't support terrorism against the sovereign nation of Cuba just because it's done in an anti-communist label.
[00:48:19.373 --> 00:48:21.994]  You can't support... Let me just stop you.
[00:48:22.034 --> 00:48:22.794]  Let me just stop you.
[00:48:24.475 --> 00:48:27.997]  I go back and expose how Al-Qaeda was created and how it's still controlled.
[00:48:28.677 --> 00:48:34.501]  I go over how they wanted to have Operation Northwoods to hijack jets and blow them up and blame it on Cuba.
[00:48:34.861 --> 00:48:36.642]  And I said that you can't do that.
[00:48:37.642 --> 00:48:39.143]  And that's in my film Road to Tyranny.
[00:48:39.163 --> 00:48:40.744]  So I don't know what you're talking about, John.
[00:48:40.784 --> 00:48:41.424]  Thanks for the call.
[00:48:42.005 --> 00:48:43.726]  And I'm not going to be able to get through to you.
[00:48:44.306 --> 00:48:49.249]  There's a chief globalist strategist, Harold Quigley, saying everything I'm saying.
[00:48:50.109 --> 00:48:51.410]  This is just the facts, John.
[00:48:53.027 --> 00:48:54.388]  And the left isn't going to wake up.
[00:48:54.408 --> 00:48:55.569]  They're going to be good little commies.
[00:48:55.609 --> 00:48:56.429]  And the right isn't going to wake up.
[00:48:56.449 --> 00:48:57.410]  They're going to be good little fascists.
[00:48:58.571 --> 00:49:00.232]  And the globalists control the whole paradigm.
[00:49:01.333 --> 00:49:02.254]  What about freedom?
[00:49:03.274 --> 00:49:04.295]  What about free market?
[00:49:04.315 --> 00:49:05.496]  What about sovereignty?
[00:49:06.457 --> 00:49:16.504]  The communists, you know, your buddy Putin is merging with NATO now and using terror attacks that he's behind in most cases, we can document, as a pretext for control.
[00:49:16.564 --> 00:49:17.504]  I mean, wake up!
[00:49:18.605 --> 00:49:19.306]  Wake up!
[00:49:20.186 --> 00:49:22.108]  Emmett in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[00:49:22.168 --> 00:49:22.528]  Go ahead.
[00:49:23.604 --> 00:49:24.905]  Todd, my new friend.
[00:49:24.925 --> 00:49:26.065]  How you doing?
[00:49:27.006 --> 00:49:36.770]  You know, you go to go out and buy a pair of shoes, and every shoe you go to pick up, it doesn't matter if it's Clarks, Dexter, or whatever, made in China.
[00:49:38.531 --> 00:49:40.232]  Poor quality, they don't fit.
[00:49:43.291 --> 00:49:44.091]  So much for that.
[00:49:44.111 --> 00:49:45.612]  But anyway... Well, that's the thing, though.
[00:49:45.632 --> 00:49:46.472]  We want junk.
[00:49:46.512 --> 00:49:47.492]  We want to be slaves.
[00:49:47.512 --> 00:49:48.832]  We want to slit our own throats.
[00:49:48.973 --> 00:49:53.314]  But economically, our government has low tariffs on China.
[00:49:53.334 --> 00:49:54.554]  They have high tariffs on us.
[00:49:55.234 --> 00:50:03.876]  That has been done on top of the slave labor to destroy us, to destroy the middle class, and the government admits it.
[00:50:04.277 --> 00:50:06.437]  For President, I like Ralph Nader.
[00:50:06.577 --> 00:50:09.638]  Back in the 70s, he spoke at our community college.
[00:50:10.222 --> 00:50:15.665]  And when I was working for the State Highway Department, I stopped him, and he talked to me.
[00:50:15.685 --> 00:50:17.025]  It was very nice.
[00:50:17.065 --> 00:50:20.567]  He was driving a 10-year-old Plymouth, green and yellow Plymouth.
[00:50:21.728 --> 00:50:30.772]  I think he's a very humble man, except that for vice president running mate, he chose a man from the Socialist Workers Party.
[00:50:30.872 --> 00:50:32.473]  Yeah, no, he's controlled, brother.
[00:50:33.013 --> 00:50:33.514]  Oh, is he?
[00:50:33.734 --> 00:50:34.034]  Okay.
[00:50:34.054 --> 00:50:35.374]  You want to talk about Ralph Nader?
[00:50:36.175 --> 00:50:36.475]  Yes.
[00:50:37.155 --> 00:50:37.696]  All right, stay there.
[00:50:37.716 --> 00:50:38.316]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:39.525 --> 00:50:40.667]  We've got a guest coming up, too.
[00:50:40.687 --> 00:50:46.674]  We've got actually two guests coming up, but we'll continue with phone calls.
[00:50:46.694 --> 00:50:46.955]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:46.975 --> 00:50:49.638]  A lot of key news and information coming up.
[00:50:49.658 --> 00:50:50.359]  You don't want to miss it.
[00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:51.380]  Stay with us.
[00:50:51.921 --> 00:50:53.864]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:50:53.944 --> 00:50:55.986]  Infowars.net's been redesigned.
[00:50:56.287 --> 00:50:57.328]  Infowars.net.
[00:50:57.388 --> 00:50:57.869]  Check it out.
[00:51:02.429 --> 00:51:09.812]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:10.072 --> 00:51:14.814]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:15.054 --> 00:51:20.696]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:20.916 --> 00:51:25.478]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:51:25.678 --> 00:51:32.822]  The casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:51:32.862 --> 00:51:37.364]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.544 --> 00:51:40.065]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:51:40.305 --> 00:51:46.288]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our Constitution.
[00:51:46.328 --> 00:51:46.628]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:52:01.272 --> 00:52:03.253]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[00:52:03.333 --> 00:52:14.038]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:52:14.418 --> 00:52:18.940]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:30.345]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:52:30.925 --> 00:52:37.789]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:52:38.169 --> 00:52:40.310]  Your purified water is now ready.
[00:52:40.810 --> 00:52:45.773]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[00:52:46.073 --> 00:52:52.842]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:53.023 --> 00:52:56.648]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:52:56.888 --> 00:52:57.689]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:02.970 --> 00:53:08.919]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:11.403]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:11.584 --> 00:53:17.954]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:53:18.274 --> 00:53:18.934]  We're good to go.
[00:53:40.882 --> 00:53:41.723]  We're good to go.
[00:53:41.803 --> 00:53:42.043]  I think?
[00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:27.282]  I've got the curator of the Andy Warhol Museum coming on, because they've run this controversial art display, which I have mixed views on, concerning the tortured Abu Ghraib.
[00:54:27.302 --> 00:54:35.748]  I mean, obviously they're saying it's wrong, they say they're documenting the crime, but it's also an example of double-think by the public, and we'll get into that.
[00:54:35.909 --> 00:54:38.731]  That's only about a 20-minute interview, then we'll get back to all your calls, and
[00:54:40.322 --> 00:54:51.192]  All the news, like Al-Qaeda's seen planning for spectacular election attack, just as Ridge has said they would, because Ridge, you know, he just hates to be re-elected.
[00:54:52.433 --> 00:54:59.539]  Also, again, we'll get into London terror evacuation plans, New York terror evacuation plans, SWAT teams busting in the wrong houses, beating up old people.
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:01.921]  All part of the new freedom.
[00:55:03.342 --> 00:55:05.905]  We're going to go back to Emmett and Ray and...
[00:55:07.523 --> 00:55:09.724]  Many, many others that are holding here in just a few minutes.
[00:55:09.844 --> 00:55:13.225]  Before I do that, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:55:13.265 --> 00:55:15.505]  We're fighting Earth being turned into a prison planet.
[00:55:15.585 --> 00:55:19.227]  That's why it's called PrisonPlanet.com and now PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:55:19.647 --> 00:55:33.731]  If you're online, PrisonPlanet.tv has all 11 of my videos, a bunch of other great videos by folks that have authorized us to post them, my weekly TV reports, sometimes two weekly TV reports, but always one,
[00:55:34.494 --> 00:55:39.479]  Text reports, all my best radio interviews, my book, Paul Watson's book.
[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:40.960]  They're both there.
[00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:42.902]  You can read them online or download them or print them.
[00:55:43.783 --> 00:55:45.905]  Fifteen cents a day.
[00:55:46.185 --> 00:55:48.307]  $5.95 a month.
[00:55:48.847 --> 00:55:49.308]  $54.95 a year.
[00:55:49.568 --> 00:55:51.950]  And we did this because, frankly, we're victims of our own success.
[00:55:52.391 --> 00:55:55.934]  Tens of millions of visitors, and then the bandwidth charges got so high.
[00:55:55.994 --> 00:55:59.197]  So you want privileged, exclusive...
[00:55:59.932 --> 00:56:00.292]  We're good to go.
[00:56:25.842 --> 00:56:30.126]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, order via the SafeSecure shopping cart.
[00:56:30.727 --> 00:56:35.071]  Our new film, American Dictators, is out, documenting the staged election of 2004.
[00:56:35.191 --> 00:56:44.240]  It gets into a lot of the police state in the New World Order and Kerry and Bush and how there are two peas in a pod or two peas in a skull and bones coffin.
[00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:48.230]  Big discounts when you get three or more of any of my 11 films.
[00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:50.550]  1-888-253-3139 to call and order.
[00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:56.231]  They can also answer your questions and tell you about different specials.
[00:56:56.251 --> 00:56:56.311]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:56.371 --> 00:56:57.351]  Or just write to me.
[00:56:57.371 --> 00:56:58.791]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:57:13.149 --> 00:57:16.252]  And your purchase of the films and books also is vital to our operations.
[00:57:16.912 --> 00:57:18.153]  And thanks for all your support.
[00:57:19.134 --> 00:57:20.495]  All right, Emmett, Pennsylvania.
[00:57:20.555 --> 00:57:26.400]  Yeah, Ralph Nader talks about the corruption, but then he has bad solutions.
[00:57:28.341 --> 00:57:28.862]  I see.
[00:57:29.202 --> 00:57:33.005]  And then Ralph Nader had his book published by Rupert Murdoch, his new book.
[00:57:33.505 --> 00:57:36.688]  Ralph Nader's former campaign manager was Skull and Bones.
[00:57:36.708 --> 00:57:38.049]  We brought that up to him here on air.
[00:57:39.530 --> 00:57:40.611]  You know, all of that...
[00:57:41.366 --> 00:57:44.188]  So, Ralph Nader is a very suspicious character.
[00:57:44.828 --> 00:57:44.948]  Oh.
[00:57:45.329 --> 00:57:49.931]  I thought you had offered he to appear on your show.
[00:57:51.232 --> 00:57:53.954]  They actually called me and wanted to come on.
[00:57:53.974 --> 00:57:55.295]  He was on the broadcast.
[00:57:55.795 --> 00:57:56.315]  I see.
[00:57:56.335 --> 00:58:03.479]  Okay, and in closing, are you going to be offering Dave on Clay's 9-11 film?
[00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:04.580]  I don't know.
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:05.821]  Uh-huh.
[00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:08.111]  I hadn't thought about it.
[00:58:08.551 --> 00:58:13.693]  But I do have George Humphrey's new video and Eric Huffman's video and, of course, both my 9-11 films.
[00:58:13.713 --> 00:58:15.073]  Okay, thank you.
[00:58:15.673 --> 00:58:16.474]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[00:58:16.794 --> 00:58:21.376]  And I'm not trying to say Ralph Nader's evil and I know he's a government agent or something.
[00:58:22.596 --> 00:58:23.616]  I mean, I interviewed him.
[00:58:23.696 --> 00:58:28.738]  I spoke at one of his rallies because I was asked to speak there and openly said I didn't agree with him on a lot of stuff.
[00:58:29.959 --> 00:58:31.919]  But, you know, and I had him on this show.
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:35.961]  But I just, doing a lot of research, it's very suspicious.
[00:58:38.846 --> 00:58:43.327]  Again, I have to give you false choices, false saviors, false escapers.
[00:58:44.527 --> 00:58:46.708]  We'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:58:46.728 --> 00:58:48.608]  A guest, your calls, a lot of news.
[00:58:48.629 --> 00:58:50.649]  Stay with us.
[00:58:57.911 --> 00:58:58.551]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.571 --> 00:59:00.331]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.992 --> 00:59:02.052]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.722 --> 00:59:03.562]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.302 --> 00:59:05.223]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.243 --> 00:59:09.804]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.064 --> 00:59:14.185]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.526 --> 00:59:19.126]  All right, my friends, thanks for joining us in the second hour.
[00:59:19.246 --> 00:59:22.587]  Al-Siaid has seen planning for spectacular attacks in the U.S.
[00:59:22.627 --> 00:59:23.067]  and England.
[00:59:23.547 --> 00:59:25.548]  Lots of martial law preparations for that.
[00:59:26.644 --> 00:59:28.925]  New York City scrambling to handle nuke strike.
[00:59:29.085 --> 00:59:31.907]  Moscow car bomb suspect beaten to death by police.
[00:59:32.547 --> 00:59:34.828]  Masked SWAT team storm wrong home.
[00:59:34.908 --> 00:59:38.210]  Beat up 50-year-old liver transplant patient here in the U.S.
[00:59:39.251 --> 00:59:43.033]  Heckling a Yankees fan landed editor in a Baltimore prison hell.
[00:59:44.301 --> 00:59:47.603]  And much, much more in this second hour.
[00:59:47.983 --> 00:59:56.307]  We also have the curator of the Andy Warhol Museum, Thomas Solskoski, coming on about how they, as an art display, have the torture photos.
[00:59:56.387 --> 01:00:00.869]  So we'll talk to him about this controversial exhibit coming up just for a segment or two.
[01:00:01.309 --> 01:00:02.970]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:05.231]  Let's talk to Ray in Michigan.
[01:00:05.291 --> 01:00:06.171]  Ray, you're on the air.
[01:00:06.352 --> 01:00:06.772]  Go ahead.
[01:00:07.072 --> 01:00:07.852]  Yeah, it's Roy.
[01:00:07.912 --> 01:00:13.095]  But anyway, you know, I was standing in front of the courthouse at Lake County at...
[01:00:14.346 --> 01:00:26.229]  One of the officers is coming up the walk, and he's talking out loud, like talking to himself, I guess, I don't know, but he's saying that, boy, he's having a good time messing with the people.
[01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:35.292]  And I try to stop him to let him know that he was threatened by his old words and his old actions.
[01:00:36.432 --> 01:00:41.714]  That historically, all of these billions of the government
[01:00:42.749 --> 01:00:48.715]  Whether they be the bears of the cities or whatever, their threat is much bigger than ours.
[01:00:49.175 --> 01:00:53.919]  So wait a minute, you're out there and this guy's walking around going, I love messing with the people, I just love it.
[01:00:53.939 --> 01:00:55.421]  Yeah, of course he didn't use that word.
[01:00:55.741 --> 01:00:56.301]  What did he say?
[01:00:56.822 --> 01:01:00.145]  Well, I can't repeat what he said, otherwise you'll shut me up.
[01:01:01.429 --> 01:01:08.493]  Well, that's the nature of tyranny, is when they find out they're God, we're slaves, and they're going to enjoy abusing us, and that's just the way it is.
[01:01:08.833 --> 01:01:13.695]  They have to find those type of sociopaths, those type of control freaks, and they become the majority.
[01:01:14.195 --> 01:01:19.538]  They're not the majority now of the police, but they're becoming a large minority that could become a majority.
[01:01:19.878 --> 01:01:21.819]  But the point of the whole thing is that...
[01:01:22.449 --> 01:01:26.791]  If we look at this historically, what is happening, there's nothing new under the sun.
[01:01:27.211 --> 01:01:29.232]  This has all happened again and again and again.
[01:01:29.492 --> 01:01:30.332]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:01:30.372 --> 01:01:32.153]  Why do you call in using a voice changer?
[01:01:32.513 --> 01:01:33.614]  I don't have a voice changer.
[01:01:34.794 --> 01:01:36.215]  You've got a really deep voice, then.
[01:01:37.055 --> 01:01:39.576]  Well, I have a tumor in my nose.
[01:01:39.936 --> 01:01:40.916]  Oh, I apologize.
[01:01:41.657 --> 01:01:43.417]  Because it sounds just like a voice.
[01:01:43.437 --> 01:01:44.378]  You know it's a great voice.
[01:01:44.398 --> 01:01:45.478]  Y'all do commercials, man.
[01:01:45.738 --> 01:01:46.059]  Yes, I do.
[01:01:46.079 --> 01:01:47.779]  No, I'm not trying to be mean.
[01:01:47.799 --> 01:01:48.519]  I apologize.
[01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:50.480]  No problem.
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:51.141]  But anyway...
[01:01:52.719 --> 01:02:05.342]  If we look at this historically, if they look at it historically, if they look at every time there is a takeover, always the officials are the ones who step into the debt first, and they get taken out.
[01:02:05.822 --> 01:02:08.082]  So, I mean, did you have any relationship with this guy?
[01:02:08.102 --> 01:02:09.503]  Did he know you were listening?
[01:02:09.883 --> 01:02:12.903]  Well, he couldn't help but know that I could hear him.
[01:02:13.023 --> 01:02:14.424]  There was several of us.
[01:02:14.484 --> 01:02:20.585]  We were standing out there smoking a cigarette, and he's coming up to walk, and he's saying this as he's coming up to walk.
[01:02:21.454 --> 01:02:24.675]  He's just having a great time messing with the people.
[01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:35.797]  Well, he better hope that his children and his family, that they're all going to be police, because in this new future, you know, that happens.
[01:02:35.837 --> 01:02:41.278]  The cop sends his daughter off to some other city, and then she gets, you know, beat up by police or raped by them.
[01:02:41.578 --> 01:02:43.719]  He'll go, my gosh, my daughter should be God, too.
[01:02:43.739 --> 01:02:45.579]  And they go, nope, she doesn't have the God ship.
[01:02:46.239 --> 01:02:49.180]  Well, there's even... See, the point that I try to get across...
[01:02:50.052 --> 01:02:53.494]  We know this exists, and we know it exists on a pretty big scale today.
[01:02:54.255 --> 01:02:58.798]  The fact of the matter is that they're not looking at this, and they need to start looking at it.
[01:02:59.378 --> 01:03:01.579]  We're about to break, but let me ask you a question.
[01:03:01.619 --> 01:03:06.462]  Did you say to him, Hey, buddy, what are you saying?
[01:03:06.482 --> 01:03:07.783]  How did he respond?
[01:03:07.823 --> 01:03:14.107]  Was he shocked that a slave who's supposed to be bent over the cotton field would look even into his eyes?
[01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:15.708]  I tried to stop you.
[01:03:15.908 --> 01:03:17.109]  I said, Hey, buddy, wait a minute.
[01:03:17.449 --> 01:03:18.230]  I want to talk to you.
[01:03:19.071 --> 01:03:23.293]  And he took it, just kept on walking it, walked right out into the courtroom.
[01:03:24.334 --> 01:03:32.577]  And I was able to talk to other officers and let them know what a threat that he was to the community.
[01:03:32.617 --> 01:03:33.658]  What did they say about that?
[01:03:34.959 --> 01:03:39.501]  Well, all of them admit they've got plenty of cowboys on the force.
[01:03:40.221 --> 01:03:41.201]  Plenty of cowboys.
[01:03:41.262 --> 01:03:44.403]  It'll be the police chief, and the guy that isn't will be the toilet attendant.
[01:03:44.683 --> 01:03:45.403]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:45.484 --> 01:03:46.384]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:49.179 --> 01:03:51.286]  We're good to go.
[01:03:55.848 --> 01:04:01.333]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:04:01.754 --> 01:04:06.298]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:04:06.418 --> 01:04:13.265]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:04:13.645 --> 01:04:19.751]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:04:19.891 --> 01:04:21.092]  There are no side effects.
[01:04:21.272 --> 01:04:21.753]  We're good to go.
[01:04:38.212 --> 01:04:41.294]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[01:04:41.314 --> 01:04:41.354]  866-885-6625.
[01:04:41.374 --> 01:04:41.474]  866-885-6625.
[01:04:41.714 --> 01:04:42.594]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:04:42.614 --> 01:04:42.874]  Call today.
[01:04:54.113 --> 01:05:03.159]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:05:03.419 --> 01:05:14.647]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:05:14.987 --> 01:05:20.711]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:05:20.951 --> 01:05:21.612]  We're good to go.
[01:05:45.391 --> 01:05:45.551]  803-4438.
[01:05:45.571 --> 01:05:51.274]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:05:52.355 --> 01:05:56.697]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:56.877 --> 01:06:01.299]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:01.459 --> 01:06:05.861]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:06:05.881 --> 01:06:07.222]  The New World Order.
[01:06:09.009 --> 01:06:13.234]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:13.294 --> 01:06:20.244]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:20.344 --> 01:06:22.346]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:22.847 --> 01:06:23.407]  We're good to go.
[01:06:58.008 --> 01:06:58.669]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.309 --> 01:07:00.389]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.089 --> 01:07:02.190]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.830 --> 01:07:03.710]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:05.291]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.311 --> 01:07:09.652]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.152 --> 01:07:14.293]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:17.114 --> 01:07:23.916]  I got our next guest on because it's a great example of double think, of double speak.
[01:07:25.586 --> 01:07:27.768]  They show the images of torture on the news.
[01:07:27.868 --> 01:07:39.036]  By the way, the edited ones, that is, out of thousands of photos and videos, they just showed a few dozen photos, which were purposefully released, by the way, as part of a psyop to enrage the Islamic world.
[01:07:40.037 --> 01:07:44.200]  Part of the Pentagon program P2OG to enrage and create enemies.
[01:07:46.232 --> 01:07:52.235]  And they show piles of dead Jews being pushed into mass graves in World War II and having their heads blown off by Nazis.
[01:07:52.695 --> 01:07:54.076]  They show Civil War photos.
[01:07:54.096 --> 01:07:56.457]  They show photos of black people being lynched.
[01:07:57.137 --> 01:07:58.498]  And frankly, it should be shown.
[01:07:59.379 --> 01:08:03.261]  You know, we can see all these simulated murders on TV and it's all funny and entertainment.
[01:08:03.301 --> 01:08:04.261]  Let's eat some popcorn.
[01:08:04.741 --> 01:08:06.742]  But the real thing, we're not supposed to see it.
[01:08:08.063 --> 01:08:10.104]  And the government doesn't want you to see what they're up to.
[01:08:10.144 --> 01:08:11.785]  Just like they don't want you to see executions.
[01:08:12.665 --> 01:08:14.066]  Just like they don't want you to see any of this.
[01:08:16.244 --> 01:08:21.412]  So it's part of a psychological warfare program, but all these people are freaking out and pulling their hair out.
[01:08:21.472 --> 01:08:22.493]  Now the photos are out.
[01:08:23.034 --> 01:08:30.946]  At the Andy Warhol Museum in New York, and by the way, I don't agree with some of the displays they've had that I've seen over the years.
[01:08:31.681 --> 01:08:33.482]  But, you know, it's their right, First Amendment.
[01:08:33.842 --> 01:08:36.204]  Well, they put it out there and said this is a bad thing that happened.
[01:08:36.224 --> 01:08:36.884]  We're illustrating.
[01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:38.746]  This is about the moral decline.
[01:08:39.166 --> 01:08:43.349]  And here's an article out of the Pittsburgh newspaper, another one out of the Associated Press.
[01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:45.830]  Prisoner abuse exhibit opens today.
[01:08:45.850 --> 01:08:50.333]  The Andy Warhol Museum exhibit featuring images of prisoner abuse and autograph opens today.
[01:08:50.353 --> 01:08:51.074]  That was last week.
[01:08:51.474 --> 01:08:52.735]  And it's already causing a stir.
[01:08:55.752 --> 01:08:58.955]  And again, folks, they've had similar exhibits in New York City.
[01:08:59.296 --> 01:09:00.337]  Other museums have.
[01:09:01.097 --> 01:09:09.125]  Some Pittsburghers are skeptical that the photographs belong to an art exhibit, but that's just fine with museum director Thomas Solosky.
[01:09:10.026 --> 01:09:13.630]  I'm glad people are disagreeing because that's their right, he said.
[01:09:13.670 --> 01:09:14.330]  The pics show U.S.
[01:09:14.370 --> 01:09:15.952]  soldiers annihilating and beating prisoners.
[01:09:16.552 --> 01:09:31.296]  Even mocking the dead, you know, they beat to death, one soldier, Bedford County native specialist Jeremy C. Sivitz, but guilty for his involvement in the abuse, and six more have been charged, including Corporal Charles A. Rainer, Jr.
[01:09:31.596 --> 01:09:39.239]  of Fayetteville County, and these are just, again, some of the locals there, and of course, Lindy England of Fort Ashby, West Virginia.
[01:09:41.419 --> 01:09:43.420]  And it says, former prisoner of war, Howard
[01:09:44.366 --> 01:09:49.209]  Lauenberg78 of Penn Heights questioned the artistic value of the photographs.
[01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:53.492]  I don't think it should be on the walls of a museum, but I think it could serve as a purpose.
[01:09:53.552 --> 01:09:57.654]  It can show what a little war mindset can do to you.
[01:09:57.674 --> 01:10:06.660]  Well, I mean, in my videos I've got photos of masters of terror of Japanese cutting prisoners of war's heads off.
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:11.783]  We have to document the tyranny, the murderous abuse, the killing.
[01:10:12.663 --> 01:10:13.984]  So it's really double-think.
[01:10:15.112 --> 01:10:21.454]  And the government doesn't want to release the other thousands of photos and videos which show them raping women, raping children, beating people to death.
[01:10:22.315 --> 01:10:24.035]  I don't know if that should be released.
[01:10:25.176 --> 01:10:26.316]  Perhaps it should be released.
[01:10:26.336 --> 01:10:27.417]  Things should be blurred out.
[01:10:27.737 --> 01:10:31.678]  It should be released, you know, with parental advisements.
[01:10:32.118 --> 01:10:33.539]  I mean, we need to know, folks.
[01:10:33.579 --> 01:10:36.420]  There's all these neocons on the radio saying, yeah, torture them.
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:36.840]  It's good.
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:37.780]  Torture's good.
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.161]  Well, look what you've done.
[01:10:39.461 --> 01:10:41.121]  The Army's own report, 70 to 90 percent
[01:10:43.927 --> 01:10:54.009]  Of the people that were picked up at checkpoints, according to the Army's own report, were women and children, people that didn't have their papers in order, and they were taken to some of the 32 camps over there.
[01:10:56.910 --> 01:11:04.631]  And so it's evil when our troops under orders beat somebody to death or rape their wife in front of them, and it's evil when Al-CIA to cut somebody's head off.
[01:11:05.351 --> 01:11:07.412]  But not according to these double thinkers out there.
[01:11:07.472 --> 01:11:07.732]  Okay.
[01:11:08.337 --> 01:11:11.081]  Museum Director Thomas Sokoloski.
[01:11:11.101 --> 01:11:12.223]  I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
[01:11:13.265 --> 01:11:16.670]  He's the curator and director of the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.
[01:11:17.150 --> 01:11:18.052]  Good to have you on, sir.
[01:11:18.372 --> 01:11:19.193]  Thank you for having me.
[01:11:21.397 --> 01:11:22.879]  I personally don't get it.
[01:11:23.019 --> 01:11:23.981]  I don't know why...
[01:11:24.801 --> 01:11:26.043]  I've got another article here.
[01:11:26.643 --> 01:11:31.169]  You know, Vets Group decry Warhol Museum's plans for Abu Ghraib exhibit.
[01:11:31.670 --> 01:11:35.615]  I'm reading right here that your exhibit decries what happens and is illustrated.
[01:11:35.635 --> 01:11:37.397]  They have art museums about the Holocaust.
[01:11:37.437 --> 01:11:39.339]  Why can't we have an art display about this?
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.502]  Well, I think, you know, it's a couple of things.
[01:11:41.622 --> 01:11:42.223]  I think people...
[01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:51.445]  See the possibilities that someone could take this exhibition and use it as just an out-and-out indictment of the military, which it is meant to be.
[01:11:51.485 --> 01:12:01.150]  I mean, I think we'd all agree that the people who were involved were aberrant soldiers, and the majority are quite noble and honorable, and some have died for our country.
[01:12:01.671 --> 01:12:05.673]  But at the same time, I think some people question the idea that art is only...
[01:12:06.193 --> 01:12:06.954]  We're good to go.
[01:12:06.974 --> 01:12:07.194]  I think?
[01:12:25.026 --> 01:12:36.257]  Collected images of people, suicides, people jumping out of windows, people being shot, car crashes, and then would incorporate those into his artwork to make the fact of if
[01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:41.665]  In one side of his work, Campbell's suit meant the glories of the American way.
[01:12:42.085 --> 01:12:50.515]  Then the opposite side was the opportunity to buy cars and maybe go drunk when you're driving and crash yourself and maybe other people.
[01:12:50.755 --> 01:12:55.621]  That was part of the darker side of the American way, too, and we needed to see both sides.
[01:12:56.201 --> 01:12:58.084]  And the idea of this exhibition was to say,
[01:12:59.873 --> 01:13:03.975]  Not so much to indict X, Y, or Z persons who did these acts.
[01:13:04.015 --> 01:13:07.136]  I mean, the government is doing that, and military justice will be meted out.
[01:13:07.536 --> 01:13:15.139]  But the fact that you and I have the potential of doing these same acts when we're caught in the middle of war.
[01:13:15.159 --> 01:13:17.340]  I mean, there are exigent things that happen in war.
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:20.522]  And I'm not saying that they are right, but there are exigent things.
[01:13:20.902 --> 01:13:28.805]  But then, if you do something, let's say, to hopefully save lives, then you take that image of that nefarious act
[01:13:29.167 --> 01:13:31.728]  And paraded down an avenue around television.
[01:13:32.069 --> 01:13:34.070]  That's something that I just don't understand.
[01:13:34.890 --> 01:13:45.596]  And in a sense, in the photographs themselves, in addition to the interrogation techniques and what have you, you have people responding, some of the soldiers responding gleefully.
[01:13:45.656 --> 01:13:50.238]  So it's not even, I have to beat this guy in order to save other lives, but I'm enjoying it.
[01:13:50.879 --> 01:13:52.039]  And what does that really say?
[01:13:52.059 --> 01:13:59.242]  And by the way, they're going to come back here and be prison guards, they're going to come back here and be police officers, and they're going to have this taste.
[01:14:00.082 --> 01:14:01.643]  Well, you know, that's an interesting thing.
[01:14:01.683 --> 01:14:10.166]  And my view would be, hey, if we want to come down and say that all people, if forced into it, will act like that, I might even say that I don't know what I would do.
[01:14:10.646 --> 01:14:11.467]  I'll be honest enough to say that.
[01:14:11.487 --> 01:14:12.167]  Well, let me just stop you.
[01:14:12.187 --> 01:14:13.067]  I've interviewed the military.
[01:14:13.107 --> 01:14:14.868]  I've read their own documents on this.
[01:14:16.533 --> 01:14:19.374]  The General Kilpinski wasn't even allowed in those sectors.
[01:14:19.414 --> 01:14:21.576]  It was run by the CIA and private contractors.
[01:14:21.916 --> 01:14:26.118]  They were ordered to do this, and of course no one high level will be held accountable for this.
[01:14:26.138 --> 01:14:29.800]  They're going to burn some of the demonic minions that did this.
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.061]  But yeah, we've seen the photos.
[01:14:31.861 --> 01:14:35.784]  Supposedly there's these videos, and it gets much, much worse by whole levels.
[01:14:36.564 --> 01:14:38.585]  But yeah, gleefully enjoying it.
[01:14:38.905 --> 01:14:42.367]  The pleasure in this is shades of Ted Bundy.
[01:14:42.828 --> 01:14:43.068]  Mm-hmm.
[01:14:43.909 --> 01:14:50.273]  Well, I couldn't disagree with you, and the point is, if that's what we have to do in war, maybe we need to know that.
[01:14:50.373 --> 01:14:53.275]  As one of my friends said, why be worried about these photographs?
[01:14:53.315 --> 01:15:00.279]  That's why he, in particular, is very often against warfare, because when people get into a wartime situation, this is what happens.
[01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:07.284]  And if that is the way it is, that's the way it is, but then you can't have the double standard of saying, war is glorious and war is wonderful.
[01:15:07.464 --> 01:15:11.967]  If we get down in the pit, then we have to get down in the pit, and we can't have our cake and eat it, too.
[01:15:12.717 --> 01:15:21.581]  Well, that's true, but I've read documents where the British, 300 years ago, go, we've got to have a war to divert attention and to create a cadre for domestic control.
[01:15:22.202 --> 01:15:30.185]  I mean, the government's always known, you march off a bunch of people to war, you get to bring them back as a control arm or a group of well-trained attack dogs.
[01:15:30.606 --> 01:15:32.026]  And so this is all part of a process.
[01:15:32.066 --> 01:15:36.969]  And I wonder, here's my advice to you, because you get a lot of attention and are pretty prestigious.
[01:15:37.429 --> 01:15:41.591]  Why don't you watch Threat Matrix or 24, and why don't you show video clips...
[01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:47.273]  Well, I certainly think part of the reason for us also to show these is that, as you suggested earlier on,
[01:16:06.139 --> 01:16:07.601]  Oh, this really isn't me.
[01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:31.232]  I'm play-acting at being Luke Skywalker or something, and then it's okay.
[01:16:31.953 --> 01:16:45.877]  We have a comment book in the exhibition, and although it's only been open a couple of days, I've been really surprised at the thoughtful comments, both from Americans, and then we often have foreign visitors, and some commentary by them about what they see in these photographs.
[01:16:45.897 --> 01:16:50.218]  It's been very interesting, and I've been gratified by how thoughtful people have been.
[01:16:50.791 --> 01:16:53.794]  Well, the exhibit is entitled Inconvenient Evidence.
[01:16:53.874 --> 01:16:54.135]  Right.
[01:16:54.655 --> 01:16:57.658]  And it's Iraqi prisoner photographs from Abu Ghraib.
[01:16:58.279 --> 01:17:05.526]  It presents a selection of the photographs arranged next to Warhol works, photos, and random cultural bits and pieces.
[01:17:07.108 --> 01:17:09.831]  But, again, I don't get what the whole hoopla is about.
[01:17:10.783 --> 01:17:15.746]  It just shows that people think this is going to be critical, so they want to try to censor it.
[01:17:16.306 --> 01:17:18.947]  How long is the exhibition going to be open?
[01:17:19.067 --> 01:17:20.968]  It will run through November 30th.
[01:17:21.789 --> 01:17:38.017]  And it also, as you suggested at the beginning, it's running here in Pittsburgh at the Andy Warhol Museum, and concurrent to the very similar exhibition, not exactly the same, but under the same title, at the International Center for Photography in New York, so people who are closer to that location can see the exhibition there.
[01:17:39.105 --> 01:17:41.587]  All right, well, I want to thank you for coming on the broadcast.
[01:17:41.647 --> 01:17:44.929]  Is there a website for people to visit the Warhol Museum?
[01:17:44.949 --> 01:17:48.531]  Yes, they can just go to www.warhol.org.
[01:17:49.011 --> 01:17:50.252]  And how do you spell Warhol?
[01:17:50.592 --> 01:17:52.173]  W-A-R-H-O-L.
[01:17:53.574 --> 01:17:54.775]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[01:17:55.095 --> 01:17:56.396]  No, I think we've talked about it.
[01:17:56.836 --> 01:17:59.338]  Thank you for giving me a chance to chat about the exhibition.
[01:17:59.498 --> 01:18:00.458]  All right, thanks for coming on.
[01:18:00.638 --> 01:18:01.159]  Thank you, sir.
[01:18:01.479 --> 01:18:03.780]  All right, there goes the director of the Annie Warhol Museum.
[01:18:05.001 --> 01:18:06.202]  I mean, people...
[01:18:07.699 --> 01:18:12.280]  We need to realize that there's a bigger story here.
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:15.180]  Why were the photos released to begin with?
[01:18:16.761 --> 01:18:29.463]  These were taken by the CIA, these were released, these were brought out, as General Parton said, to enrage the Arabs, to make America look bad, and then to make the UN look like the good cop, so they can later come in as the savior.
[01:18:30.423 --> 01:18:31.683]  And that's exactly what's happening.
[01:18:32.223 --> 01:18:35.924]  The torture is much more serious than what they released, and it's going on all over these 32...
[01:18:37.708 --> 01:18:39.749]  Now we learn there's other secret camps, so 32+.
[01:18:40.789 --> 01:18:42.009]  We'll come back, go to Ray.
[01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:43.330]  We already went to Ray.
[01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:49.552]  We'll go to Glenn and Pam and John and Carlos and many others.
[01:18:49.892 --> 01:18:51.993]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[01:18:52.013 --> 01:18:52.573]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:56.803]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:18:57.163 --> 01:19:00.045]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:19:00.266 --> 01:19:06.471]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[01:19:06.831 --> 01:19:14.157]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[01:19:14.337 --> 01:19:18.441]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[01:19:18.681 --> 01:19:24.226]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[01:19:24.446 --> 01:19:37.577]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.

[01:19:47.925 --> 01:19:55.928]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:19:56.188 --> 01:20:00.030]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:01.150]  Read the labels.
[01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:05.712]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:20:05.932 --> 01:20:10.133]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:20:10.493 --> 01:20:15.355]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:20:15.755 --> 01:20:19.278]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:20:19.518 --> 01:20:24.862]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:20:25.142 --> 01:20:27.864]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.

[01:20:55.319 --> 01:20:59.620]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:00.861]  It still is.
[01:21:01.501 --> 01:21:04.982]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[01:21:05.322 --> 01:21:07.123]  You know the old saying, good is gold?
[01:21:07.683 --> 01:21:09.724]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[01:21:10.296 --> 01:21:12.317]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[01:21:12.697 --> 01:21:20.361]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[01:21:20.741 --> 01:21:24.503]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.
[01:21:25.203 --> 01:21:30.165]  Call this toll-free number for your free investing and precious metals kit.
[01:21:30.465 --> 01:21:32.927]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[01:21:48.481 --> 01:21:56.607]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[01:21:56.627 --> 01:21:58.269]  I've tried many, many products.
[01:21:58.409 --> 01:22:00.771]  I have never experienced anything like college naked.
[01:22:01.171 --> 01:22:04.954]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than 8 weeks.
[01:22:05.385 --> 01:22:06.066]  It truly works.
[01:22:06.426 --> 01:22:07.668]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[01:22:08.048 --> 01:22:14.016]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:22:14.096 --> 01:22:20.144]  Vim and Vigor's collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism, and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[01:22:20.504 --> 01:22:20.964]  We're good to go.
[01:22:43.141 --> 01:22:46.364]  And listen, get $25 off a three-month supply of collagenate.
[01:22:46.664 --> 01:22:49.506]  So call now, 1-800-622-THEN.
[01:22:49.826 --> 01:22:50.407]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[01:22:50.427 --> 01:22:59.994]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:23:00.014 --> 01:23:00.854]  until 2 p.m.
[01:23:00.914 --> 01:23:01.595]  Central Time.
[01:23:01.615 --> 01:23:04.117]  We're here live and back from 9 to midnight Central.
[01:23:05.838 --> 01:23:09.501]  Going out on the AM and FM dial, simulcasting on Global Shortwave.
[01:23:10.197 --> 01:23:14.458]  During the day at 94.75, and at night at 32.10, and of course the internet.
[01:23:15.478 --> 01:23:18.759]  And you know the website's prisonplanet.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[01:23:18.799 --> 01:23:22.120]  We've now redesigned and relaunched infowars.net.
[01:23:23.381 --> 01:23:31.403]  Okay, we'll go to these loaded phone lines for the balance of the hour here in a few minutes, but I want to mix in some important news with that, so callers, be patient with me.
[01:23:32.463 --> 01:23:36.204]  Again, I see one of these articles every couple days, and usually I don't even cover them.
[01:23:36.244 --> 01:23:38.765]  I mean, it's not my goal to sit here and bash police, but...
[01:23:39.418 --> 01:23:44.859]  Men in black ski masks and black uniforms with submachine guns busting in people's homes at 4 a.m.
[01:23:44.899 --> 01:23:54.341]  at night, you know, looking for drugs when they sell almost the exact same molecules as pharmacological drugs and push them on the school children.
[01:23:54.741 --> 01:23:56.002]  It's a joke, people.
[01:23:56.322 --> 01:24:03.463]  The government ships them in, then owns the private prisons of the very drug dealers that ship in the drugs.
[01:24:04.484 --> 01:24:06.504]  Then they grab you and put you in their own private prisons.
[01:24:07.188 --> 01:24:10.349]  And this is out of the Clarksville Leaf Chronicle.
[01:24:10.849 --> 01:24:16.011]  Masked SWAT team storms wrong home, beats up 50-year-old liver transplant patient.
[01:24:17.812 --> 01:24:21.973]  Clarksville police apologized for raiding wrong home.
[01:24:22.033 --> 01:24:23.314]  Now, normally they don't do that.
[01:24:25.115 --> 01:24:25.995]  So at least they did that.
[01:24:26.533 --> 01:24:34.717]  It's like a few months ago in Tennessee, they had a drill and ran in with the guns, sort of firing blanks without even telling anybody at the city council.
[01:24:34.757 --> 01:24:35.718]  A bunch of them got fired.
[01:24:35.778 --> 01:24:38.039]  I mean, it's this conditioning that's going on.
[01:24:38.839 --> 01:24:46.844]  Clarksville Police Chief Mark Smith said he will offer two residents a written apology for officers mistakenly raiding their home Friday night.
[01:24:47.604 --> 01:24:49.305]  I want to publicly apologize, Smith.
[01:24:50.103 --> 01:24:58.289]  Said this week during a press conference, adding that Friday's mistake was the first time in 28 years with the department that officers had broken into the wrong home.
[01:24:58.729 --> 01:25:01.552]  This is certainly no pattern here, he said.
[01:25:01.572 --> 01:25:08.076]  According to Smith, the police tactical team received information that a drug dealer lived at 343B Old Trenton Road.
[01:25:11.658 --> 01:25:12.479]  We're good to go.
[01:25:33.129 --> 01:25:44.500]  And it says Guler, whose arm was in a sling from a previous injury, told police that they had the wrong man and that they pointed a gun at her and Elliot, who is deaf and had recently received a liver transplant, she said.
[01:25:45.401 --> 01:25:54.570]  And it said Guler went for medical help after the raid, said Elliot, and planned to go to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville yesterday to be seen by doctors.
[01:25:55.356 --> 01:26:05.806]  Smith said that although he feels terrible about the raid, he insists that the officers never use excessive force, but because Elliott resisted, officers had to control him by bringing him down, he said.
[01:26:05.827 --> 01:26:12.873]  And then it goes into how they grabbed the guy who stood up and was deaf and waved his arms and slammed him and jumped on top of him.
[01:26:13.314 --> 01:26:17.198]  We've got all the photos of cops smiling while they do this, dropping their knee on the back of your neck.
[01:26:17.338 --> 01:26:18.279]  I mean, it's a joke.
[01:26:19.378 --> 01:26:23.879]  We ensure it's done safely with a minimal amount of force as possible, Smith said.
[01:26:24.279 --> 01:26:29.420]  But Goulier and Elliott's attorney, Thomas Meeks, said that what the police did is unacceptable.
[01:26:31.701 --> 01:26:37.722]  And it says, what justification can you give to kick a 54-year-old man who's down on the ground?
[01:26:37.822 --> 01:26:38.763]  Well, that's freedom.
[01:26:39.383 --> 01:26:43.824]  I think for him waving his arms, they should have probably taken him to prison for life.
[01:26:44.104 --> 01:26:47.985]  Meeks said about Elliott, who was a Vietnam War veteran, all he saw...
[01:26:49.798 --> 01:26:51.240]  Was men in masks and rifles.
[01:26:52.261 --> 01:26:53.362]  He'd been taught that was terrorists.
[01:26:53.382 --> 01:26:53.983]  No, that's freedom.
[01:26:54.403 --> 01:26:55.264]  He was terrified.
[01:26:55.324 --> 01:26:59.809]  Then to get knocked down and to be stopped, they picked him up like a suitcase.
[01:27:00.190 --> 01:27:04.755]  The police department said they acted in normal procedure, but that's not normal.
[01:27:05.459 --> 01:27:14.346]  Smith said the man they were looking for was Jeremiah Taylor, 24, who was arrested and charged Friday night with possession of ecstasy for resale.
[01:27:14.366 --> 01:27:17.228]  A separate warrant was taken for a raid on his home.
[01:27:17.548 --> 01:27:21.892]  Taylor was booked into the Montgomery County Jail and set at $28,000.
[01:27:25.504 --> 01:27:35.551]  And it says the mix-up happened because drug agents with major crimes unions who got their information from an informant, but even though the address was reportedly checked before the raid, the wrong house was still entered.
[01:27:36.732 --> 01:27:50.040]  Yeah, a lot of these articles, you know, were some 65-year-old Republican official who's an insurance mogul, has him busting his house, and he just runs around the corner, you know, so they shoot him 12 times.
[01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:50.541]  You know, it's...
[01:27:51.863 --> 01:27:58.545]  But usually the story you see is 75-year-old Hispanic immigrant, shotgun in belly.
[01:27:58.565 --> 01:28:04.668]  You know, here in Austin, they come in the house and shotgun somebody in the wrong house, you know, wrong person.
[01:28:05.248 --> 01:28:07.749]  Or they shoot their own cop and then try to frame somebody.
[01:28:08.069 --> 01:28:14.231]  We even caught them doing that in Medlin a few years ago, where they shoot their own officers and try to frame up the innocent guy.
[01:28:14.831 --> 01:28:15.632]  But it turned out his...
[01:28:17.456 --> 01:28:23.019]  That it was a black powder rifle locked up in a safe, so the cops had to admit that they tried to frame him.
[01:28:23.319 --> 01:28:24.239]  That's the scary part, man.
[01:28:24.279 --> 01:28:25.960]  They come to your house, they shoot their own people.
[01:28:26.761 --> 01:28:28.221]  Usually, they're going to go ahead and frame you.
[01:28:28.241 --> 01:28:29.082]  Well, what are we going to do?
[01:28:29.102 --> 01:28:31.343]  You shot Billy Bob.
[01:28:31.363 --> 01:28:33.244]  Let's just frame this guy.
[01:28:33.844 --> 01:28:36.005]  All right, team leader, we'll do it.
[01:28:36.425 --> 01:28:37.526]  Go Joe!
[01:28:37.546 --> 01:28:38.827]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:38.847 --> 01:28:39.307]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.974 --> 01:28:44.895]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.355 --> 01:28:46.996]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.016 --> 01:28:50.678]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:29:01.485 --> 01:29:06.969]  You've tried the vets and prescription drugs, but the cost is taking a toll on you, and the side effects are taking a toll on your pet.

[01:30:55.787 --> 01:31:03.113]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.

[01:33:37.908 --> 01:33:48.514]  To get the VHS or DVD, to pop it in, to make a copy every night when you go to bed, to give it to friends, to family, to neighbors, to talk show hosts, to put them on AXS TV, to effect change.
[01:33:48.554 --> 01:33:53.356]  That's why all of my videos, you're authorized to make copies of them for non-profit educational purposes.

[01:34:43.888 --> 01:34:49.311]  And secondarily, this does support us, and the more you support us, the more we can do.
[01:35:05.706 --> 01:35:09.588]  And the new film, American Dictators, is documenting the staged election of 2004.
[01:35:09.728 --> 01:35:12.810]  It gets into Bush and Kerry, Skull and Bones being cousins.
[01:35:13.110 --> 01:35:15.371]  We go back to Bohemian Grove, interview locals.
[01:35:16.612 --> 01:35:17.933]  Then we get into their policies.
[01:35:18.313 --> 01:35:20.514]  We get into Ralph Nader basically being a stooge.
[01:35:21.795 --> 01:35:27.358]  It's all in the new film, American Dictators, which is only $19.95 because it's 90 minutes long.
[01:35:27.738 --> 01:35:30.820]  My other films are all over two hours long, some almost three hours.
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:31.580]  So they're $25.95.
[01:35:33.759 --> 01:35:38.281]  $20 a piece when you order three or more of any of my original ten films.
[01:35:38.301 --> 01:35:40.722]  That's a big discount, so be sure and take advantage of that.

[01:35:47.486 --> 01:35:47.966]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:49.506 --> 01:35:57.030]  Let's go back to the calls, and I'll get back into New York City, scrambling to handle Nuke Strike and a lot more.
[01:35:58.616 --> 01:36:04.537]  Let's go ahead and talk to, oh I guess up next is Glenn in Colorado.
[01:36:04.557 --> 01:36:05.858]  Thanks for holding her on the air, sir.
[01:36:06.218 --> 01:36:08.318]  Hey Alex, I'm on the cutting edge.
[01:36:08.778 --> 01:36:18.220]  I thoroughly enjoy PrisonPlanet.tv and I encourage everyone to join me in attaining all the information that's there.
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:19.281]  It's just mind-boggling.
[01:36:19.301 --> 01:36:20.601]  Well, thank you for your support.
[01:36:21.141 --> 01:36:25.262]  You put out such a great, so many different products at such a low price and
[01:36:26.010 --> 01:36:29.493]  Everybody needs to get their hands on all this good information.
[01:36:30.293 --> 01:36:42.983]  The reason I was calling Alex this past Friday, and I'm in the heart of Northcom territory, the Denver Post, big headlines last Friday, Columbine file gone.
[01:36:43.843 --> 01:36:44.544]  Big headlines.
[01:36:44.604 --> 01:36:47.506]  Grand jury says evidence lacking for indictment.
[01:36:48.186 --> 01:36:51.129]  Jefferson County officials deny attempt at cover-up.
[01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:56.212]  And then the families are saying, well, the conspiracy is now confirmed.
[01:36:56.913 --> 01:37:00.115]  And so I guess we could have guessed all of this, but it finally came out.
[01:37:00.535 --> 01:37:14.784]  Actually, I was quite shocked that they even had a grand jury thing, but Ken Salazar is running for Senate, and I think he felt that it would make him look good, and he did get a lot of praise for actually doing a grand jury, but nothing came out of it, basically.
[01:37:15.064 --> 01:37:16.365]  Well, on April 20, 1999, two teenagers...
[01:37:21.670 --> 01:37:29.072]  Supposedly put over 120 bombs, some of them large propane bombs, in the school.
[01:37:30.172 --> 01:37:30.932]  That's ridiculous.
[01:37:32.152 --> 01:37:33.913]  Didn't happen, folks, as they say it did.
[01:37:34.293 --> 01:37:39.614]  Then they go in and shoot people, and I've got the video of the children coming out, the young people coming out and going, there were four masked men.
[01:37:40.014 --> 01:37:40.815]  They were shooting.
[01:37:41.355 --> 01:37:45.576]  Then they release like 20 seconds, 15 seconds of the video of them going to the lunchroom.
[01:37:46.856 --> 01:37:51.177]  They don't release the dozens and dozens of videotapes they admit they have.
[01:37:51.849 --> 01:37:55.732]  Then police start crying and admitting, oh, I shot the children we were ordered to.
[01:37:55.752 --> 01:37:57.574]  They were trying to run out of the building.
[01:37:57.614 --> 01:37:58.674]  That's Rocky Mountain News.
[01:37:58.694 --> 01:38:00.636]  I mean, that's in Road to Tyranny.
[01:38:02.197 --> 01:38:07.021]  And then you've got the sheriff meeting with the principal, the school about 40% empty.
[01:38:08.182 --> 01:38:17.249]  I had the Rocky Mountain News editor on a few years ago, and I said, you know, for almost three hours, the police didn't go in.
[01:38:17.269 --> 01:38:19.851]  And he goes, no, no, Mr. Jones, it was almost four hours.
[01:38:20.811 --> 01:38:21.972]  So it was worse than I thought.
[01:38:22.713 --> 01:38:24.014]  And, you know, ask yourself that.
[01:38:24.054 --> 01:38:30.860]  And then they just have this shooting of a security guard up at the Illinois State Building.
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:38.226]  And the guy admittedly escaped, but they went ahead and locked everybody in their rooms for an hour, ensuring no one can get away when there's a real mass shooting.
[01:38:38.606 --> 01:38:40.308]  So all of this is very suspicious.
[01:38:40.348 --> 01:38:41.409]  And you have Harrison Kleibold
[01:38:41.769 --> 01:38:53.655]  You know, they're parents of government people, one a psychologist, one an Air Force officer, involved in defense contractor jobs, and on top of that, you've got them in some weird program in 1991 that was a 2020 piece about
[01:38:56.463 --> 01:39:03.287]  A weird suicide program, a test program, teaching the kids how to commit suicide and weird occult teachings going on at the school.
[01:39:03.307 --> 01:39:04.448]  This is mainstream news.
[01:39:04.748 --> 01:39:06.169]  Having them get in coffins every day.
[01:39:06.449 --> 01:39:08.550]  Harrison Kleibold ran the school's computers.
[01:39:09.451 --> 01:39:13.073]  The police wouldn't do the search warrant to the house after all this had happened.
[01:39:13.133 --> 01:39:13.713]  Why not?
[01:39:14.253 --> 01:39:17.115]  Because, folks, this is very obvious.
[01:39:17.155 --> 01:39:18.616]  Can you say Russian school?
[01:39:19.616 --> 01:39:22.198]  What you hear isn't what really happened.
[01:39:23.777 --> 01:39:29.441]  And, of course, the son of a prominent FBI agent founded the Trenchcoat Mafia there two years before in 1997.
[01:39:29.641 --> 01:39:30.662]  Go ahead.
[01:39:31.683 --> 01:39:34.965]  That's exactly it, and it's a shame that people don't realize that.
[01:39:35.025 --> 01:39:43.091]  I talk to so many people around here, and they have no clue what went on, and they just think, you know, these two teens just went off the deep end.
[01:39:43.171 --> 01:39:49.876]  And, of course, we also find out that they were on some of these wonderful drugs that they have under the new freedom and so forth.
[01:39:50.336 --> 01:39:51.637]  It's all a big mess, but...
[01:39:52.392 --> 01:39:55.054]  Anyway, it's good that some of this is finally coming out.
[01:39:55.074 --> 01:39:58.657]  I mean, actually, the Denver Post saying, you know, conspiracy confirmed.
[01:39:59.337 --> 01:40:00.017]  Do me a favor.
[01:40:00.138 --> 01:40:03.160]  Email that to the webmaster at Prison Planet.
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:03.860]  I sure will.
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:04.301]  No problem.
[01:40:04.501 --> 01:40:05.161]  Thanks a million.
[01:40:05.181 --> 01:40:05.982]  Good to hear from you.
[01:40:06.382 --> 01:40:07.123]  Thanks for holding.
[01:40:07.823 --> 01:40:09.544]  Let's talk to Pam in New Mexico.
[01:40:09.584 --> 01:40:10.245]  Pam, welcome.
[01:40:12.106 --> 01:40:12.306]  What?
[01:40:12.626 --> 01:40:12.787]  Hello?
[01:40:12.827 --> 01:40:13.227]  Yes, Pam.
[01:40:13.667 --> 01:40:13.887]  Yeah?
[01:40:14.268 --> 01:40:14.488]  Uh-huh.
[01:40:14.868 --> 01:40:15.268]  I'm here.
[01:40:15.428 --> 01:40:16.129]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[01:40:16.669 --> 01:40:18.611]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:40:18.711 --> 01:40:19.411]  Thank you for calling.
[01:40:19.431 --> 01:40:19.711]  Go ahead.
[01:40:20.012 --> 01:40:20.112]  Um...
[01:40:20.965 --> 01:40:30.450]  I've been in what has been called the 9-11 truth movement ever since the get-go, ever since 9-11 happened, and I smelled a rat.
[01:40:31.150 --> 01:40:47.099]  And since then I've been sending out yearbooks and videos and Paul Joseph Watson's books and George Humphrey's books at Video and Campus and David Ray Griffin and Eric Humsfeld.
[01:40:47.459 --> 01:40:47.959]  Humsfeld.
[01:40:50.555 --> 01:41:01.719]  And I thought, I had sort of naively assumed that everybody else that was doing the same thing that I'm doing, a lot of people are, trying to get the word out as best we can.
[01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:12.323]  I just naively assumed that everybody had the same motivation as I do to wake Americans up and to our government's complicity.
[01:41:12.924 --> 01:41:18.406]  But I just read this thing on Renz.com's website.
[01:41:19.591 --> 01:41:24.794]  The Creepy Sides of the 9-11 Truth Movement by Angie something.
[01:41:24.834 --> 01:41:26.095]  There's no last name given.
[01:41:26.575 --> 01:41:41.964]  But she posits a very scary scenario that some of the people involved in the 9-11 Truth Movement are doing it for different reasons.
[01:41:44.665 --> 01:42:01.850]  Put the, cast America in a bad light and so that the New World Order or the UN or, you know, that the world will gang up against us and be more open to the UN or the New World Order.
[01:42:03.730 --> 01:42:10.272]  And I wouldn't, I might discount all this except for the fact that I, for one thing, I just saw
[01:42:11.169 --> 01:42:20.131]  In Newsweek, I saw a full-page ad for Eric Huffschmidt's book and video, which I think is great.
[01:42:20.151 --> 01:42:21.131]  Wait a minute.
[01:42:21.151 --> 01:42:21.791]  Wait a minute.
[01:42:21.871 --> 01:42:22.551]  In Newsweek?
[01:42:22.872 --> 01:42:23.412]  Newsweek.
[01:42:23.432 --> 01:42:26.152]  The September 20th edition of Newsweek.
[01:42:26.172 --> 01:42:29.093]  There's a full-page ad for painful questions.
[01:42:30.073 --> 01:42:31.113]  Well, that's wonderful.
[01:42:31.173 --> 01:42:32.134]  Yeah, it is wonderful.
[01:42:32.454 --> 01:42:33.394]  It is wonderful.
[01:42:33.414 --> 01:42:34.274]  And who's offering it?
[01:42:34.294 --> 01:42:35.394]  Eric Huffschmidt?
[01:42:35.834 --> 01:42:37.015]  No, this guy.
[01:42:37.195 --> 01:42:39.015]  Well, actually, I guess it is Eric.
[01:42:39.797 --> 01:42:42.342]  Because the 800 number, I think, is Eric's number.
[01:42:44.841 --> 01:42:51.883]  The person who endorses it and who's paying for this big ad is James W. Walter.
[01:42:52.204 --> 01:42:52.764]  Let me stop you.
[01:42:52.784 --> 01:42:55.385]  We actually have him coming up in the next hour.
[01:42:56.745 --> 01:43:00.066]  He's a guy who's paid for other big ads exposing the Iraq War.
[01:43:00.086 --> 01:43:02.627]  There are some people who I'd call middle class.
[01:43:02.647 --> 01:43:04.608]  Somebody's worth $10 million, folks.
[01:43:04.628 --> 01:43:08.109]  There are people who are worth $10 billion who aren't even in the elite.
[01:43:08.489 --> 01:43:10.070]  I think that's great news.
[01:43:10.730 --> 01:43:18.617]  And, you know, what you're going to have in any type of movement is some people who think everybody's an agent and everything's bad and, oh my gosh, you can't trust anybody.
[01:43:19.078 --> 01:43:20.098]  You know, oh, what are we going to do?
[01:43:20.139 --> 01:43:21.360]  But no, I think this is good.
[01:43:21.380 --> 01:43:26.144]  Now, let me just, because I've been letting you go for a while, let me just talk a little bit for a second.
[01:43:26.264 --> 01:43:26.744]  Okay.
[01:43:26.784 --> 01:43:27.025]  Look.
[01:43:28.266 --> 01:43:28.566]  Okay.
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:33.362]  There are people in the 9-11 movement who want to try to control it and put out their spin.
[01:43:33.462 --> 01:43:37.303]  I don't think from what I've seen that the gentleman you just mentioned is doing that.
[01:43:37.683 --> 01:43:42.565]  And I think Eric Hushman's videos are absolutely amazing and absolutely vital.
[01:43:42.985 --> 01:43:54.750]  And I'm so glad to hear about this because I have just gotten the news that the gentleman you just mentioned is going to spend a million dollars on advertising things to get the truth out.
[01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:55.770]  I think that's wonderful.
[01:43:56.985 --> 01:44:08.569]  Now, again, I've said for two years that the globalists will allow some of 9-11 to come out to then try to demonize America to make the UN look like the good cop and the savior.
[01:44:08.849 --> 01:44:09.970]  But that's not happening.
[01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:13.691]  People are figuring out that this is a larger global operation.
[01:44:14.171 --> 01:44:16.272]  And so we've got to bring the truth out regardless.
[01:44:16.832 --> 01:44:17.992]  America didn't do this.
[01:44:18.392 --> 01:44:20.893]  Criminal elements promoting the global government did.
[01:44:22.454 --> 01:44:23.074]  Go ahead.
[01:44:23.499 --> 01:44:24.360]  Yeah, okay.
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:50.194]  The other thing I wanted to mention is, well, I'm glad to hear you say that, is that David Gray Griffin's book, and I sent that book out, which I think is excellent to a lot of people, too, but the Richard Falk, who did the introduction to David Gray Griffin's book, is apparently, according to this woman on this website, is...
[01:44:51.289 --> 01:44:56.070]  A member of the CFR, the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:58.671]  Look, I don't know that, but listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:44:59.431 --> 01:45:10.594]  Folks, regardless of, and I'll have to research that, I mean, a lot of the stuff you see out there on the net, and I haven't seen this particular thing, is just ridiculous.
[01:45:10.714 --> 01:45:12.894]  It's smokescreens.
[01:45:14.074 --> 01:45:20.596]  But regardless, folks, half of New Yorkers think the government was behind 9-11 in a Zogby poll.
[01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:23.601]  We have to be prepared to win.
[01:45:24.562 --> 01:45:27.264]  We have to be prepared to see it all come out.
[01:45:28.565 --> 01:45:34.629]  It's like the last caller with the Denver Post saying, conspiracy, government covering up Columbine.
[01:45:35.589 --> 01:45:37.510]  We have to be prepared for the truth to come out.
[01:45:37.971 --> 01:45:39.051]  That's what we've been doing.
[01:45:39.592 --> 01:45:50.659]  I mean, in 1800, you were an evil kook if you didn't support slavery.
[01:45:51.528 --> 01:45:54.809]  But 65 years later, you were a kook if you were forced slavery.
[01:45:56.849 --> 01:46:02.250]  So, you know, before Galileo came out, you were a kook if you thought the world was round.
[01:46:02.290 --> 01:46:04.531]  A few years later, you were a kook if you thought it was flat.
[01:46:05.471 --> 01:46:07.091]  So we're going to win this fight.
[01:46:07.231 --> 01:46:08.791]  We have the truth on our side.
[01:46:09.752 --> 01:46:20.154]  And if people want to pay to put full-page ads in major newspapers to promote people's works to expose 9-11, let me just say it.
[01:46:20.574 --> 01:46:20.894]  More
[01:46:21.798 --> 01:46:24.500]  Power to them.
[01:46:25.481 --> 01:46:26.961]  More power to you.
[01:46:27.842 --> 01:46:29.483]  This is very exciting.
[01:46:30.784 --> 01:46:33.746]  And I just think it is absolutely amazing.
[01:46:35.167 --> 01:46:43.212]  Now, you can call back and talk to the guests when they're on, but I just, you know, I read some article along those lines.
[01:46:43.232 --> 01:46:47.335]  I don't know if it's the same one about a week ago, and I just don't see any meat and potatoes in it.
[01:46:48.726 --> 01:46:51.587]  But regardless, the government did stand down on 9-11.
[01:46:51.627 --> 01:46:52.627]  There were these drills.
[01:46:53.387 --> 01:46:55.448]  The bin Laden family was flown out of the country.
[01:46:55.508 --> 01:46:58.529]  Public officials were called and warned not to fly.
[01:46:59.149 --> 01:47:03.610]  The Bush did have the launch orders to go up against Afghanistan on his desk two days before 9-11.
[01:47:03.970 --> 01:47:05.951]  They did train the supposed hijackers at U.S.
[01:47:05.971 --> 01:47:06.831]  military bases.
[01:47:07.231 --> 01:47:08.732]  Building 7 was blown up.
[01:47:10.372 --> 01:47:13.813]  All of this is admitted, and I'll continue to tell the truth and expose it.
[01:47:15.134 --> 01:47:21.099]  Now, when we do expose the Abu Ghraib photos, we point out, we believe the Pentagon released these on purpose to demonize America.
[01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:24.943]  But we go to the next level and expose that, therefore expose them.
[01:47:25.983 --> 01:47:29.326]  Truth is the antiseptic to this disease.
[01:47:29.567 --> 01:47:30.027]  Sunlight.
[01:47:30.868 --> 01:47:32.389]  And I suggest we get it out there, people.
[01:47:32.429 --> 01:47:34.551]  Just stay focused on exposing the New World Order.
[01:47:35.011 --> 01:47:36.252]  Stay focused on exposing 9-11.
[01:47:36.893 --> 01:47:41.577]  Because 9-11 is the basis on which they built this entire fraud.
[01:47:41.837 --> 01:47:42.898]  This whole police state.
[01:47:43.524 --> 01:47:52.568]  Believe me, if they wanted the truth of 9-11 to come out, to totally demonize America, the 9-11 Whitewash Commission would have done that.
[01:47:54.369 --> 01:47:56.109]  No, we're forcing their hand.
[01:47:56.650 --> 01:48:08.995]  Are there individuals out there, who you didn't name by the way, who I think there's evidence is clear are trying to put out this info and take control of the movement and ensure that the real facts don't come out?
[01:48:10.060 --> 01:48:11.160]  Yes, that's going on.
[01:48:11.281 --> 01:48:14.762]  Are there people out there who are trying to demonize those of us in the movement that are exposing this?
[01:48:15.062 --> 01:48:17.043]  Are there those out there that want to just say it's the U.S.
[01:48:17.083 --> 01:48:17.423]  government?
[01:48:17.483 --> 01:48:17.783]  Yes.
[01:48:20.044 --> 01:48:28.267]  But regardless, this isn't a movement run by Alex Jones or Eric Hubschmidt or George Humphrey or Michael Moore or this whitewash film.
[01:48:28.387 --> 01:48:32.608]  It's about you checking out the facts for yourself.
[01:48:33.949 --> 01:48:36.490]  It's just that simple.
[01:48:37.097 --> 01:48:39.538]  It is up to you to take action.
[01:48:39.598 --> 01:48:42.180]  It is up to you to get involved.
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:45.502]  It is up to you to expose the New World Order.
[01:48:45.862 --> 01:48:48.543]  And you know you're good, so be that leader.
[01:48:50.564 --> 01:48:51.985]  And whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[01:48:52.025 --> 01:48:53.246]  Don't expose 9-11.
[01:48:53.266 --> 01:48:54.546]  That could bring down America.
[01:48:54.686 --> 01:48:59.729]  Well, if we don't expose that it was a globalist operation, it could aid the globalists.
[01:48:59.809 --> 01:49:05.132]  But the globalists... Globalists, what they're trying to do, certainly...
[01:49:05.834 --> 01:49:06.635]  Is whitewashing.
[01:49:06.675 --> 01:49:08.076]  And they're doing that through mainstream media.
[01:49:08.096 --> 01:49:12.421]  Well, there were some discrepancies and some drills and some prior knowledge, but it's all accidental.
[01:49:13.642 --> 01:49:16.765]  You know, that's the predominant spin that we're seeing.
[01:49:16.985 --> 01:49:22.411]  By the way, if you want Eric Huffman's great video, we have it, and we have his book, his colored book.
[01:49:23.217 --> 01:49:26.739]  9-11 Painful Questions, 9-11 Painful Deceptions is the video.
[01:49:27.059 --> 01:49:31.541]  You have it on VHS and DVD.
[01:49:31.561 --> 01:49:34.682]  And that's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:49:34.802 --> 01:49:37.063]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:49:37.283 --> 01:49:41.064]  All right, we'll come back and get into some more news.
[01:49:41.885 --> 01:49:46.027]  Then we'll get to John and Carlos and Lee and many others.
[01:49:46.087 --> 01:49:47.627]  So everybody, stay with us.
[01:49:47.687 --> 01:49:49.648]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:49:49.668 --> 01:49:50.769]  Don't forget prisonplanet.tv.
[01:49:53.712 --> 01:49:55.214]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.394 --> 01:49:58.477]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.617 --> 01:50:02.521]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.561 --> 01:50:06.825]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:50:07.145 --> 01:50:10.929]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.009 --> 01:50:12.891]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:12.911 --> 01:50:12.971]  Wow.
[01:50:13.471 --> 01:50:16.353]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[01:50:16.393 --> 01:50:21.096]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.276 --> 01:50:24.318]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.498 --> 01:50:27.360]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:33.964]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.504 --> 01:50:35.224]  We're good to go.
[01:50:35.244 --> 01:50:35.724]  We're good to go.
[01:50:53.231 --> 01:50:53.832]  Hello, folks.
[01:50:53.932 --> 01:50:54.833]  Alex Jones here.
[01:50:54.973 --> 01:50:59.076]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:50:59.216 --> 01:51:02.099]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:51:02.179 --> 01:51:08.905]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:51:09.085 --> 01:51:12.088]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:51:12.288 --> 01:51:14.710]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:51:14.811 --> 01:51:19.535]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove...
[01:51:19.755 --> 01:51:20.616]  We're good to go.
[01:51:20.696 --> 01:51:21.176]  We're good to go.
[01:51:44.799 --> 01:51:44.819]  803-4438.
[01:51:45.399 --> 01:51:47.680]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:51.041]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:51:54.202 --> 01:52:00.143]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:00.364 --> 01:52:02.624]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:02.824 --> 01:52:09.166]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500 parts per million, Olive Leaf Extract,
[01:52:09.506 --> 01:52:10.167]  We're good to go.
[01:52:25.057 --> 01:52:25.417]  We're good to go.
[01:52:56.178 --> 01:53:02.180]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:05.741]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:08.661 --> 01:53:20.505]  By the way, what the earlier caller mentioned, that individual's coming up, Jimmy Walters, saying he's going to spend a lot of money exposing 9-11, and he's done this in the past on other issues.
[01:53:22.097 --> 01:53:23.498]  And so we'll watch and see what happens.
[01:53:23.518 --> 01:53:25.359]  But I say running an ad for Eric Huffman.
[01:53:25.399 --> 01:53:26.940]  I mean, that's the best sign I can imagine.
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:28.281]  That film is so well documented.
[01:53:28.321 --> 01:53:29.181]  It's an amazing video.
[01:53:29.822 --> 01:53:30.562]  So good job.
[01:53:30.622 --> 01:53:31.523]  I'm very excited.
[01:53:31.543 --> 01:53:33.144]  We've got to get the truth out or it's over, folks.
[01:53:33.564 --> 01:53:37.346]  New York City scrambling to handle nuke strike.
[01:53:38.027 --> 01:53:41.189]  New York Post of terrorists have detonated a nuclear bomb in the city.
[01:53:41.669 --> 01:53:47.132]  As many as one million people will have to be tested and treated for radiation.
[01:53:47.252 --> 01:53:48.153]  And officials will...
[01:53:50.808 --> 01:53:55.850]  Confront mass hysteria that could cause as many casualties as the device experts say.
[01:53:56.910 --> 01:54:16.077]  Of course, the government hasn't told you to get potassium iodate, which will fill the thyroid with good iodine if there is a nuclear attack or a dirty bomb, which would protect you, it's the number one cause of death, as the thyroid filling up with radiation, with uranium, or plutonium, but my goodness, just go to them for help, they'll take care of you.
[01:54:16.637 --> 01:54:20.378]  And imagine how they'll re-engineer this society if they do carry out that attack.
[01:54:21.212 --> 01:54:28.077]  But more than three years after 9-11 attacks, the city health department only now is creating a plan to deal with the doomsday scenario.
[01:54:29.638 --> 01:54:40.467]  The department says it will award a $150,000 contract later this year, funded by the Federal Department of Homeland Security, for the step-by-step blueprint detailing the city's reaction to nuclear disaster.
[01:54:40.507 --> 01:54:43.529]  How to lock it down, how to control a lot of the people in camps.
[01:54:44.440 --> 01:55:01.850]  The request for proposals from experts bidding on the contract says the new protocols will complement current disaster plans, but notes that in the case of mass screenings, there are no federal or other guidelines to respond to this type of demand.
[01:55:02.530 --> 01:55:11.515]  Well, New York's gotten their sound wave cannons to knock out whole crowds, and their microwave guns, of course, have been told have already been deployed, so they're ready.
[01:55:11.555 --> 01:55:13.196]  You try to escape, they'll just fry you.
[01:55:14.247 --> 01:55:23.194]  It's all part of the new freedom, and it gets into all the martial law implications and all the things they're going to do.
[01:55:23.274 --> 01:55:25.176]  It's very, very scary.
[01:55:26.357 --> 01:55:28.839]  Here's another one out of the Washington Times today.
[01:55:28.999 --> 01:55:32.582]  Al-Qaeda seen planning for spectacular attack.
[01:55:33.428 --> 01:55:33.528]  U.S.
[01:55:33.568 --> 01:55:47.739]  intelligence agencies concluded recently that Al-Qaeda, fearing its credibility, is on the line, is moving ahead with plans for a major spectacular attack, despite disruptions of some operations by recent arrests in Britain and Pakistan.
[01:55:48.539 --> 01:56:01.509]  Officials said recent intelligence assessments of the group, which is blamed for the September 11th attack, state that an attack is coming and that the danger will remain high until November 2nd elections and last until inauguration day, January 20th.
[01:56:04.306 --> 01:56:08.188]  And of course, ridges out every month saying, Al Qaeda is probably going to strike during the election.
[01:56:08.228 --> 01:56:09.408]  Give up all your freedoms to us.
[01:56:09.468 --> 01:56:10.629]  And their poll numbers go up.
[01:56:11.309 --> 01:56:13.510]  It's pretty obvious what's going on here.
[01:56:13.530 --> 01:56:20.093]  You know, they've pointed out that every time the government needs to bolster what it's doing, Al Qaeda pops up.
[01:56:20.133 --> 01:56:26.956]  You know, Colin Powell in Congress says, Al Qaeda has just released a new tape to Al Jazeera saying they work with Saddam.
[01:56:27.076 --> 01:56:28.977]  And then the news media all ran out of the room.
[01:56:28.997 --> 01:56:30.358]  They come back, that's not on TV.
[01:56:30.378 --> 01:56:30.938]  They don't have that.
[01:56:30.958 --> 01:56:32.519]  And he goes, oh, they'll be getting it soon.
[01:56:34.222 --> 01:56:36.085]  It's just always there.
[01:56:36.445 --> 01:56:38.968]  Just like they were used to attack the Serbs as a pretext.
[01:56:39.348 --> 01:56:40.670]  Al-Qaeda was in the late 90s.
[01:56:41.070 --> 01:56:43.193]  It's like they're always used over and over again.
[01:56:43.693 --> 01:56:46.497]  And London terror evacuation plans have been found.
[01:56:46.597 --> 01:56:50.121]  Sky Television, this is all part of the preparation, leaking all of this.
[01:56:51.836 --> 01:56:55.780]  And the local newspaper received a copy of it.
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:57:05.130]  The 68-page dossier was headed to Operation Sassoon, Metropolitan Police Traffic Plan for Mass Evacuation of London, and, of course, martial law.
[01:57:07.071 --> 01:57:10.193]  Meanwhile, Al-Qaeda will vote for Bush, says Envoy.
[01:57:10.273 --> 01:57:22.059]  The British ambassador to Rome, Sir Ivor Roberts, caused uproar in Italy yesterday after he accused President George W. Bush of being the best recruiting surgeon for Al-Qaeda.
[01:57:22.099 --> 01:57:23.219]  Well, that's actually true.
[01:57:23.759 --> 01:57:32.784]  His private comments were leaked in the Italian press yesterday and caused consternation at the foreign office, which said they did not react and reflect government policy.
[01:57:33.467 --> 01:57:34.908]  Third hour is coming up.
[01:57:34.928 --> 01:57:39.833]  We're going to have Jim Walters on the broadcast with some amazing developments.
[01:57:39.993 --> 01:57:41.774]  If you don't want to miss it, please stay with us.
[01:57:43.696 --> 01:57:44.216]  Hello, folks.
[01:57:50.102 --> 01:57:52.404]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[01:57:52.984 --> 01:58:03.450]  What would happen if wealthy folks, middle-class people, doesn't matter, blue-collar workers got together and started spending their own money
[01:58:18.562 --> 01:58:23.626]  In the green sheets, local newspaper, you name it, exposing government prior knowledge and involvement in 9-11.
[01:58:24.387 --> 01:58:36.197]  Well, very quickly, we would go from half of the population, according to a Zogby poll in New York, knowing there was government involvement and prior knowledge, to 80-plus percent like we have with the Kennedy assassination.
[01:58:37.874 --> 01:58:51.905]  And I was aware that Jimmy Walter had helped fund the 9-11 Omission Commission meetings that were held on September 9th and 11th up in New York, and a lot of my friends and other people, my colleagues, went up to it.
[01:58:52.165 --> 01:58:54.287]  I'd already been in New York for the convention, so I couldn't go.
[01:58:55.267 --> 01:58:56.409]  But I wish I'd have been there.
[01:58:57.069 --> 01:59:08.721]  And Jimmy Walter has spent over a million dollars before exposing the fraud of the Iraq War, and now he's stepping up to the plate to spend money to advertise the truth about 9-11.
[01:59:09.682 --> 01:59:11.805]  Mr. Walter, it's good to have you on the show with us.
[01:59:12.185 --> 01:59:12.806]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:59:12.866 --> 01:59:13.546]  I'm glad to be here.
[01:59:13.566 --> 01:59:14.507]  Call me Jimmy, please.
[01:59:14.828 --> 01:59:15.168]  All right.
[01:59:15.208 --> 01:59:15.569]  Well, I...
[01:59:17.196 --> 01:59:24.602]  I just got a call from a lady in the last hour going, is Jimmy Walter the guy that put Eric Huffman's ad in Newsweek?
[01:59:24.982 --> 01:59:33.009]  That Newsweek, Businessweek, the New York Times, Inc., Reader's Digest, and there's a couple other I can't remember right off hand.
[01:59:33.729 --> 01:59:34.770]  I was in the dark about that.
[01:59:35.311 --> 01:59:39.154]  He has got a great film, and it is so exciting that you did that.
[01:59:39.935 --> 01:59:43.039]  And, of course, I'm going to beg right now to put ads for my videos.
[01:59:43.580 --> 01:59:44.240]  No, seriously.
[01:59:44.260 --> 01:59:45.462]  I mean, that is incredible.
[01:59:45.762 --> 01:59:47.264]  Why did you decide to do that?
[01:59:47.365 --> 01:59:48.826]  Alex, we're doing packages like that.
[01:59:48.887 --> 01:59:56.657]  Our next ads that are coming out are a package of Eric's book, Griffin's book, and Von Kleist's video.
[01:59:58.101 --> 01:59:59.122]  Wow, that's going to be amazing.
[01:59:59.142 --> 02:00:05.324]  We're looking for other stuff, but I only got into this thing two months ago, or two and a half months ago now.
[02:00:06.265 --> 02:00:13.168]  I've been scrambling to get stuff in print before 9-1-1 because of, of course, the anniversary drawing attention to it.
[02:00:13.628 --> 02:00:16.029]  I was the one that funded the Zogby poll, for instance.
[02:00:16.169 --> 02:00:17.310]  Yes, that was a great job.
[02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:22.732]  But we definitely want to talk to you about putting some of your stuff in our bundle as well.
[02:00:23.664 --> 02:00:24.406]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:00:24.466 --> 02:00:25.307]  I'll beg and plead.
[02:00:25.347 --> 02:00:26.209]  I mean, that's my goal.
[02:00:26.249 --> 02:00:30.898]  I tell people to make copies of my videos because that's my goal is just to get it out to people.
[02:00:31.391 --> 02:00:33.652]  Well, I'm not doing this to make money either.
[02:00:33.752 --> 02:00:34.072]  I know.
[02:00:34.112 --> 02:00:34.892]  You're spending money.
[02:00:34.932 --> 02:00:35.332]  I know that.
[02:00:36.553 --> 02:00:39.954]  Somebody asked me why I was giving them away, and I said it was cheaper than selling them.
[02:00:41.214 --> 02:00:42.154]  In a way, that's true.
[02:00:42.314 --> 02:00:42.654]  It is.
[02:00:43.014 --> 02:00:47.476]  If you don't get enough money for the ads to pay for the books, you should have just given the books away.
[02:00:47.496 --> 02:00:49.596]  Well, that's incredible.
[02:00:49.616 --> 02:00:52.917]  We'll talk about what you're doing when we get back, but tell folks a little bit about yourself.
[02:00:53.417 --> 02:00:56.478]  Well, I'm about 57 next month.
[02:00:56.838 --> 02:00:58.839]  I'm from Tampa, Florida originally.
[02:00:59.572 --> 02:01:01.994]  I've always been an idealist of sorts.
[02:01:02.114 --> 02:01:10.879]  My father talked me into going into business and I've regretted that actually, but I wanted to be a scientist as a kid.
[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:13.661]  But I've always wanted to make a difference in the world.
[02:01:15.142 --> 02:01:26.910]  Two years almost, a year and a half ago when they started to build up to the Iraq War, I'm big on the Internet, and I saw how the mainstream media just wasn't
[02:01:27.689 --> 02:01:32.711]  Telling the people what was happening and how Colin Powell was lying his head off to the U.N.
[02:01:33.571 --> 02:01:38.393]  And so I ran full-page ads in the New York Times, USA Today.
[02:01:38.413 --> 02:01:40.474]  Yeah, we covered that, yeah.
[02:01:40.754 --> 02:01:42.575]  And about Powell lying.
[02:01:42.795 --> 02:01:44.375]  Boy, you've sure been proven right.
[02:01:44.836 --> 02:01:45.936]  Oh, it's funny.
[02:01:45.996 --> 02:01:54.739]  They did an interview on me in Santa Barbara, where I live, and the reporter called the State Department and said, what do you think about the ad that was in the New York Times?
[02:01:54.779 --> 02:01:55.920]  They said, what ad?
[02:01:55.980 --> 02:01:56.700]  We don't know about it.
[02:01:57.409 --> 02:02:01.734]  So I wrote a letter to the editor that said, that's really funny.
[02:02:02.395 --> 02:02:09.063]  They know for certain there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, but they don't know about a full page ad in the New York Times.
[02:02:10.264 --> 02:02:15.491]  Should we consider this a lie, incompetence, or an incompetent lie?
[02:02:16.658 --> 02:02:17.539]  Well, I'll tell you what, Jimmy.
[02:02:17.559 --> 02:02:17.899]  Stay there.
[02:02:17.939 --> 02:02:18.459]  We've got a break.
[02:02:18.479 --> 02:02:19.300]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:19.700 --> 02:02:20.220]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:02:20.581 --> 02:02:20.921]  You bet.
[02:02:20.961 --> 02:02:23.102]  This is massive, what he's doing.
[02:02:23.162 --> 02:02:26.524]  It's going to have a huge effect, and God bless him for what he's up to.
[02:02:26.584 --> 02:02:30.066]  I just learned of it this morning to show how out of the loop I am.
[02:02:30.627 --> 02:02:32.948]  But this is very, very exciting.
[02:02:32.968 --> 02:02:35.550]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[02:02:35.590 --> 02:02:37.171]  And if you want to get involved on air, it's 1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:37.191 --> 02:02:37.431]  Stay with us.
[02:02:45.936 --> 02:02:48.358]  Two nuclear powers rattle sabers over a disputed area.
[02:02:48.738 --> 02:02:52.640]  Peace in the Middle East derailed again as another wave of suicide bombers destabilized the region.
[02:02:53.061 --> 02:02:55.682]  Here at home and abroad, our own war against terror continues.
[02:02:55.982 --> 02:02:56.663]  Important news.
[02:02:56.743 --> 02:02:59.464]  The news you need is sketchy at best when it comes to the mainstream press.
[02:02:59.785 --> 02:03:05.548]  With Grundig's Yacht Boy 400 PE World Band Shortwave Radio, world news, news that affects you, will be at your fingertips.
[02:03:05.888 --> 02:03:09.811]  The Yacht Boy 400 PE is rated as the number one portable shortwave radio in the industry.
[02:03:10.131 --> 02:03:18.896]  And for no small reason when you consider ease of operation and features like over 40 station presets, both upper and lower sidebands, as well as ship-to-shore weather and aviation bands.
[02:03:19.076 --> 02:03:24.780]  The Grundig Yachtboy 400 PE is fully digital, comes with its own carrying case, external antenna, and a headset for private listening.
[02:03:25.060 --> 02:03:26.261]  That's 1-800-569-4340 or visit cliffscott.com.
[02:03:26.301 --> 02:03:31.104]  Tune in the world and stay in touch with Grundig Shortwave Radios and Cliff Scott Enterprises.
[02:03:45.091 --> 02:03:46.711]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:03:46.831 --> 02:03:50.932]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:03:51.092 --> 02:03:53.973]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:03:54.033 --> 02:04:00.755]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:04:00.935 --> 02:04:03.936]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:04:04.136 --> 02:04:06.536]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:06.656 --> 02:04:14.138]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements
[02:04:14.258 --> 02:04:26.146]  Such as Aptazine, Benzene, Chloride, and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[02:04:26.306 --> 02:04:34.051]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:34.071 --> 02:04:34.511]  That's 888-803-4438.

[02:04:44.429 --> 02:04:48.776]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:04:48.936 --> 02:04:53.383]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:04:53.543 --> 02:04:57.950]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:04:57.970 --> 02:04:59.312]  The New World Order.
[02:05:01.095 --> 02:05:05.319]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:05:05.379 --> 02:05:12.327]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:05:12.427 --> 02:05:14.450]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:05:15.670 --> 02:05:25.252]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:05:25.432 --> 02:05:30.813]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:05:31.313 --> 02:05:33.953]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:05:34.053 --> 02:05:35.214]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:05:35.234 --> 02:05:35.674]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:05:35.694 --> 02:05:37.514]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:05:46.835 --> 02:05:52.861]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.481 --> 02:05:56.444]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:00.322 --> 02:06:02.003]  All right, folks, we're back live.
[02:06:02.043 --> 02:06:06.707]  We're talking to Jimmy Walter, and I guess you could call him a philanthropist.
[02:06:07.147 --> 02:06:17.254]  He has, with his own money, put national ads, $1.5 million worth, all over the country in major publications exposing the fraud of the weapons of mass destruction.
[02:06:17.274 --> 02:06:21.357]  He's been proven, of course, totally on target with that, and now...
[02:06:22.177 --> 02:06:37.250]  I have just learned that he has put in a whole bunch of major publications, including Newsweek, full-page ads, and I couldn't be more excited, for Eric Hufschmidt's new video with just direct phone numbers and links to Eric Hufschmidt's sites and phone number.
[02:06:37.310 --> 02:06:38.691]  That is great news.
[02:06:38.731 --> 02:06:44.736]  We've been hearing Eric Hufschmidt's video for over a year and his book for over a year, and it is such great work.
[02:06:45.317 --> 02:06:50.221]  But, Jimmy, continuing with how you woke up to 9-11 two months ago.
[02:06:50.854 --> 02:06:54.798]  Well, I had Eric's book for six months and wouldn't open it up.
[02:06:55.018 --> 02:06:56.700]  I was a sin of omission guy.
[02:06:56.760 --> 02:07:01.905]  I said, well, they probably let it happen, had some sort of stand down.
[02:07:02.966 --> 02:07:09.192]  Then someone cajoled me into watching the video and it was an epiphany to me.
[02:07:09.973 --> 02:07:10.554]  I knew then
[02:07:11.241 --> 02:07:13.823]  That those buildings were not brought down by two airliners.
[02:07:14.103 --> 02:07:18.467]  They were controlled demolition and explosives for use without a shadow of a doubt.
[02:07:18.627 --> 02:07:24.452]  I knew that the Pentagon thing, if it wasn't a cruise missile, was one of those Global Hawk type things.
[02:07:24.472 --> 02:07:28.215]  You can't prove what it was, but we can prove what it wasn't.
[02:07:28.615 --> 02:07:31.638]  It wasn't a 757.
[02:07:31.798 --> 02:07:35.221]  So I said, this is the biggest story of the century.
[02:07:35.899 --> 02:07:40.580]  Perhaps of all time, the biggest fraud ever perpetrated on anybody.
[02:07:41.821 --> 02:07:46.542]  The facts are overwhelming, but the mainstream media is not doing the facts.
[02:07:46.622 --> 02:07:50.023]  In the last two and a half months, I've gotten together the ads.
[02:07:50.363 --> 02:07:56.065]  We're running in Businessweek, Newsweek, Reader's Digest, the New York Times, the Daily News.
[02:07:57.522 --> 02:08:08.050]  We've run in alternative papers in Tampa, Sarasota, Charlotte, Atlanta, Santa Barbara, L.A., the Village Voice in New York.
[02:08:09.190 --> 02:08:10.952]  We're going to continue to run these ads.
[02:08:11.032 --> 02:08:17.496]  I'm on the phone today with placing the new ads and the new things, so you get to me in a hurry, Alex.
[02:08:17.777 --> 02:08:19.398]  We're going to go forward with this thing.
[02:08:22.809 --> 02:08:28.351]  Even though it was a bipartisan commission, and I'm still blaming the Democrats because it was a bipartisan commission.
[02:08:28.391 --> 02:08:29.592]  They didn't have to sign off on that.
[02:08:29.652 --> 02:08:30.672]  They knew what was happening.
[02:08:33.313 --> 02:08:42.456]  This fraud, this out and out audacious fraud that the 9-1-1 commission report is, has to be exposed.
[02:08:44.036 --> 02:08:46.177]  I think that this is a stake.
[02:08:46.892 --> 02:08:48.793]  That we can drive right through Bush's heart.
[02:08:48.993 --> 02:08:55.677]  Because there's no way... The worst... I mean, the best he can come out as is totally incompetent.
[02:08:58.139 --> 02:08:59.280]  Oh, I totally agree with you.
[02:08:59.320 --> 02:09:01.341]  Bottom line, they let it happen.
[02:09:01.361 --> 02:09:02.722]  I mean, how are they heroes?
[02:09:03.382 --> 02:09:05.463]  Well, it's not that they let it happen.
[02:09:05.823 --> 02:09:07.845]  This happened intentionally.
[02:09:07.865 --> 02:09:10.726]  In my opinion, Cheney has to be ended up to his neck.
[02:09:12.047 --> 02:09:12.688]  Oh, no, listen.
[02:09:12.708 --> 02:09:16.510]  The incompetence of Bush is suppressing the investigation.
[02:09:16.870 --> 02:09:18.071]  Well, let me break that down.
[02:09:18.231 --> 02:09:24.735]  What I'm saying is, no one can deny that they had total prior knowledge and let it happen.
[02:09:24.775 --> 02:09:32.280]  In my films, I clearly state they were behind it, they engineered it, the stand-downs, the drills, flying out the bin Ladens.
[02:09:32.620 --> 02:09:42.347]  No, I mean, obviously they did it, but even for people that can't believe that or who psychologically can't face it, bottom line, they at least dropped the ball horribly.
[02:09:42.567 --> 02:09:44.148]  Then how are they big heroes?
[02:09:44.408 --> 02:09:45.909]  How do they all get more funding?
[02:09:46.169 --> 02:09:47.429]  They didn't drop it once.
[02:09:47.449 --> 02:09:48.830]  They dropped it two or three times.
[02:09:48.890 --> 02:09:50.470]  They dropped it in letting it happen.
[02:09:50.790 --> 02:09:52.651]  They dropped it in the investigation.
[02:09:52.911 --> 02:09:54.311]  And they dropped it in the report.
[02:09:56.292 --> 02:09:57.652]  I wholeheartedly agree with you.
[02:09:57.912 --> 02:09:59.712]  I've got to tell you a short joke.
[02:10:00.713 --> 02:10:05.634]  Attila the Hun, Alexander the Great, and Napoleon are looking down on modern times.
[02:10:06.874 --> 02:10:11.855]  Alexander says, Have I only had machine guns that have conquered all of India?
[02:10:13.136 --> 02:10:13.836]  Attila says,
[02:10:14.736 --> 02:10:17.637]  If I'd only had tanks, I'd have conquered all Europe and Africa.
[02:10:18.918 --> 02:10:23.700]  Napoleon says, if I'd only had Fox News, no one would have known I lost in Russia.
[02:10:24.381 --> 02:10:28.803]  And that's the vacuum I'm trying to form.
[02:10:29.543 --> 02:10:39.108]  And the fact of the matter is, even though they won't print the results of the Zogby poll in the New York Times, they'll print my ad with the results of the Zogby poll of the New York Times.
[02:10:41.033 --> 02:10:41.913]  Well, exactly.
[02:10:42.334 --> 02:10:47.996]  And I would add to all of this that what you're doing is obviously of the purest motives.
[02:10:48.496 --> 02:11:00.361]  The last thing the globalists want, the New World Order crowd wants, the neocons want, the neo-fascists want, is to have national ads promoting original source documentation of what they've done.
[02:11:00.561 --> 02:11:06.704]  That's why they put on a whole 9-11 whitewash commission to try to lie and abscond with the truth.
[02:11:07.504 --> 02:11:09.004]  And we might as well address it.
[02:11:09.285 --> 02:11:10.065]  Some people are saying...
[02:11:10.808 --> 02:11:16.131]  Well, this is suspicious that somebody with means would want to step up to the plate and do this.
[02:11:16.872 --> 02:11:18.833]  Folks, that makes no sense.
[02:11:18.873 --> 02:11:22.075]  The globalists are doing everything they can to cover this up.
[02:11:23.396 --> 02:11:26.337]  Tell me how that's more... This is rhetorical, not to you directly.
[02:11:26.518 --> 02:11:36.624]  Tell me how this is more suspicious than Rupert Murdoch and these guys giving billions of dollars to the party and getting these sweetheart FCC deals.
[02:11:37.664 --> 02:11:38.425]  I'm suspicious.
[02:11:38.485 --> 02:11:39.425]  I'm giving stuff away.
[02:11:39.705 --> 02:11:40.466]  What do they think I'm doing?
[02:11:41.875 --> 02:11:43.277]  I think you're absolutely amazing.
[02:11:43.297 --> 02:11:47.582]  I mean, putting full-page ads in all these publications for Eric Huffman is a dream come true.
[02:11:47.602 --> 02:11:53.309]  I mean, I'm just telling you what's... I'm sure you're aware of what's on the net, and it's just sick.
[02:11:53.729 --> 02:11:59.496]  But I'll tell you, a lot of people are envious of those of us that have had an effect, and they're very angry that we're having an effect.
[02:12:00.578 --> 02:12:04.161]  Don't forget that these people are very slick.
[02:12:04.461 --> 02:12:06.624]  They work all sides of the street.
[02:12:06.704 --> 02:12:14.532]  There are definitely, in my opinion, moles in the 9-1-1 movement that are trying to keep us discredited.
[02:12:15.392 --> 02:12:16.534]  There are a lot of good people, too.
[02:12:16.574 --> 02:12:17.314]  Don't get me wrong.
[02:12:23.234 --> 02:12:23.815]  I have to say this.
[02:12:23.915 --> 02:12:32.197]  I also put on an event here on 9-1-1 at the Grand Ballroom, which is above the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City.
[02:12:32.257 --> 02:12:35.158]  We had a clip from David Ray Griffin.
[02:12:35.178 --> 02:12:45.721]  The best line in it, in my opinion, was, he said, I've been looking on Amazon.com and seeing that the 9-1-1 commission report is getting four and five star ratings.
[02:12:47.077 --> 02:12:51.660]  I, too, would agree with this rating if it was properly classified as a piece of fiction.
[02:12:53.261 --> 02:12:53.822]  Exactly.
[02:12:53.882 --> 02:12:54.963]  Very well done theater.
[02:12:55.763 --> 02:12:59.746]  And David Ray Griffin, I mean, I've met him.
[02:12:59.766 --> 02:13:01.287]  This is really funny, Alex.
[02:13:01.627 --> 02:13:12.115]  Now, I don't believe in mystic shit stuff, excuse me, listeners, but Eric Huffsmith lives in Santa Barbara, I live in Santa Barbara, and David Ray Griffin lives in Santa Barbara.
[02:13:15.343 --> 02:13:16.186]  It is very interesting.
[02:13:16.226 --> 02:13:20.280]  Well, you know, there's a lot of people who live in Austin, Texas that have been exposing 9-11 as well.
[02:13:22.410 --> 02:13:24.270]  Oh, a lot of Texans are pissed.
[02:13:24.630 --> 02:13:35.973]  You know, I was at the MoveOn organization showing the new ads, and they have a guy from West Texas who does an ad for them who's Republican, and it's killer.
[02:13:35.993 --> 02:13:38.033]  It just knocked my socks off when I saw it.
[02:13:38.113 --> 02:13:41.274]  I stood up and clawed and bathed like a tiger.
[02:13:41.714 --> 02:13:42.374]  I've seen that ad.
[02:13:42.414 --> 02:13:47.675]  He goes, you know what, I'll tell you, I voted for George Bush, but not for all the lies and torture and doing this to America.
[02:13:49.733 --> 02:13:50.253]  Great Ed.
[02:13:50.473 --> 02:13:53.234]  Yeah, that was produced by Richard Linklater right here in Austin.
[02:13:54.074 --> 02:13:58.876]  They ought to run the hell out of that in Austin and all of Texas.
[02:13:58.916 --> 02:14:01.956]  I've got a lot of libertarian friends.
[02:14:02.457 --> 02:14:09.999]  We don't agree on some economic stuff, but we are lockstep together on the fact that we've been lied to and the government has taken over.
[02:14:12.239 --> 02:14:13.700]  It's so 1984-ish.
[02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:18.301]  They're going to look back in history and call Orwell a prophet.
[02:14:20.330 --> 02:14:21.210]  Well, absolutely.
[02:14:21.250 --> 02:14:22.511]  I mean, look at the names of it.
[02:14:22.631 --> 02:14:24.272]  Homeland Security.
[02:14:24.732 --> 02:14:25.272]  Doublethink.
[02:14:25.292 --> 02:14:26.253]  The Clean Air Act.
[02:14:26.293 --> 02:14:27.213]  The Pure Water Act.
[02:14:27.893 --> 02:14:29.714]  It's so doublethink, it's sickening.
[02:14:30.555 --> 02:14:34.956]  Well, it's like calling it the Patriot Act when it's the opposite of what the Founding Fathers called for.
[02:14:34.976 --> 02:14:35.397]  Yeah.
[02:14:35.897 --> 02:14:38.038]  It's the opposite of what the Bill of Rights and Constitution is.
[02:14:38.538 --> 02:14:40.939]  So how many ad packages are you planning on running?
[02:14:41.619 --> 02:14:49.743]  Well, we've run already about six or eight national ads, and I'm going to run at least that many again.
[02:14:50.758 --> 02:14:52.840]  When did these ads for Eric Huffman start running?
[02:14:53.660 --> 02:15:02.007]  The first national ad was in the 9-20 issue of Businessweek.
[02:15:02.487 --> 02:15:05.329]  The second one was in the 9-20 issue of Newsweek.
[02:15:05.429 --> 02:15:11.754]  The third one, the New York Times, was really a national ad with the New York Times last Friday on page 19.
[02:15:13.035 --> 02:15:15.497]  Wow, I can't imagine how much money you spent doing that.
[02:15:16.514 --> 02:15:21.236]  Well, it's roughly... I spent a half... You had your figures a little off.
[02:15:21.276 --> 02:15:28.018]  I spent a half a million dollars on the pile of live stuff, and I'm over a million dollars now on this stuff.
[02:15:28.879 --> 02:15:31.480]  Well, all I know is the press release said a million and a half.
[02:15:31.580 --> 02:15:32.520]  Yeah, that's the total.
[02:15:33.740 --> 02:15:36.962]  You're saying just this wave of ads cost a million dollars?
[02:15:37.362 --> 02:15:41.723]  Well, that plus the event I put on, including the event I put on, was a million bucks.
[02:15:42.924 --> 02:15:43.244]  Gosh.
[02:15:44.252 --> 02:15:46.894]  Well, I wonder what's happening to Eric Huffman's telephone.
[02:15:47.915 --> 02:15:50.497]  Well, I don't know, but I hope the sales are up.
[02:15:50.557 --> 02:16:00.125]  I know that he used to be not hardly able to find his book, but now it's up in the front on Amazon in package with David Ray Griffin's book.
[02:16:00.725 --> 02:16:02.206]  They actually make a good compliment.
[02:16:02.327 --> 02:16:08.231]  David Ray Griffin doesn't have a single picture in his book, but he is totally tight logically.
[02:16:08.552 --> 02:16:12.234]  Where Eric has really good pictures and diagrams that...
[02:16:13.852 --> 02:16:32.562]  A lot of people can't visualize, but when you look at this picture of the building collapsing and you see these steel beams 150 feet away from the building... Well, the owner of Building 7 says they blew it up.
[02:16:34.383 --> 02:16:36.004]  Have you seen that footage?
[02:16:36.124 --> 02:16:40.106]  I've seen it, and I can't believe he's gotten away with that.
[02:16:41.567 --> 02:16:43.128]  He uses the term pull it.
[02:16:43.946 --> 02:16:49.167]  And then we have the next clip where they say Pullet means to demolish, but we have the firefighters saying there were bombs.
[02:16:49.187 --> 02:16:50.928]  They told AP reporters to get back.
[02:16:50.968 --> 02:16:52.228]  We have the seismographs.
[02:16:52.648 --> 02:16:53.989]  I mean, that's all there.
[02:16:54.109 --> 02:16:56.029]  And have you been at Ground Zero, folks?
[02:16:56.409 --> 02:16:59.210]  Building 7 is way, way far away from the main towers.
[02:16:59.450 --> 02:17:05.031]  The building's right where the main towers fell, barely got damaged, but it catches fire and then collapses that afternoon.
[02:17:05.592 --> 02:17:07.172]  And the fire is not wholly evident.
[02:17:07.779 --> 02:17:13.161]  I mean, we've got pictures of the building, and you see a few fires on a few floors, and that's it.
[02:17:13.602 --> 02:17:20.945]  Remember the Meridian Plaza in Philadelphia burned for 19 hours fiercely and never collapsed.
[02:17:21.485 --> 02:17:24.366]  No steel building has ever been destroyed by fire.
[02:17:24.787 --> 02:17:27.248]  You go look at the pictures of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[02:17:27.548 --> 02:17:31.990]  You see the steel framework of those buildings still standing after an atomic bomb.
[02:17:32.430 --> 02:17:33.972]  This is absolutely incredible.
[02:17:34.092 --> 02:17:37.455]  We'll be right back with our guest and get more into these serious issues.
[02:17:37.776 --> 02:17:46.204]  Stay with us.
[02:17:46.244 --> 02:17:50.929]  We all have busy lives and sometimes that causes us to miss out on the things that are most important to us.
[02:17:51.430 --> 02:17:54.573]  Well, when it comes to Genesis programs, you'll never have to miss out again.

[02:18:13.082 --> 02:18:17.026]  All you need to know is the name of the program you'd like a copy of and the month that it aired.

[02:20:48.633 --> 02:20:55.978]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[02:20:56.279 --> 02:21:00.702]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:21:00.962 --> 02:21:03.284]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste.

[02:21:15.554 --> 02:21:18.037]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.

[02:21:24.525 --> 02:21:26.067]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[02:21:26.327 --> 02:21:27.228]  Friends, don't wait.
[02:21:27.288 --> 02:21:30.290]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[02:21:30.450 --> 02:21:31.371]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.

[02:21:34.734 --> 02:21:35.675]  It's powerful stuff.
[02:21:56.679 --> 02:21:59.601]  Alright, Jimmy Walter is our guest.
[02:22:00.341 --> 02:22:04.183]  Just spent a group of packages of ads he bought a million dollars.
[02:22:04.203 --> 02:22:10.986]  It's amazing to put out some of the best work on 9-11 to the people.
[02:22:11.046 --> 02:22:12.707]  It is ultra, ultra amazing.
[02:22:13.246 --> 02:22:14.286]  Ultra exciting.
[02:22:14.947 --> 02:22:16.787]  And coming up in the next segment, we'll open the phones up.
[02:22:16.807 --> 02:22:20.788]  I know some of the callers were holding before we even got on with this, but all these issues will tie together.
[02:22:20.828 --> 02:22:25.290]  If you want to talk to our guest, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:22:25.590 --> 02:22:26.210]  Jimmy Walter.
[02:22:26.910 --> 02:22:31.452]  Jimmy, continuing with 9-11, you brought up a lot of the smoking gun points.
[02:22:32.012 --> 02:22:39.158]  There's a bunch of other points, but the point I want to make is their whole police state, this whole takeover, is based on the lies at 9-11.
[02:22:39.459 --> 02:22:40.159]  And we know this.
[02:22:40.580 --> 02:22:42.741]  Their official story is a complete fraud.
[02:22:42.761 --> 02:22:43.502]  What do you have to say to that?
[02:22:44.523 --> 02:22:48.166]  The official story is a complete fabrication.
[02:22:48.226 --> 02:22:49.287]  It's a con job.
[02:22:50.928 --> 02:22:52.590]  I totally agree with you, and...
[02:22:53.200 --> 02:23:04.608]  I totally agree with you that this is an attempt to... The people taking away our freedoms are not Osama Bin Laden, it's George W. Bush and John Ashcroft, the Blues Brothers on a mission from God.
[02:23:06.790 --> 02:23:12.974]  These people are radical, fundamentalist, religious nuts that are controlling our government.
[02:23:14.139 --> 02:23:27.608]  And I hear stories, I can't prove this, but I know Bush is a born-again, that he contacts these people who believe in the rapture and who don't want us to stop Israel, who want the final Armageddon to occur.
[02:23:28.889 --> 02:23:30.390]  Well, those are the Dominionists.
[02:23:30.450 --> 02:23:33.992]  And to break this down, Bush is Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove.
[02:23:34.412 --> 02:23:39.896]  They manipulate Christians into believing that basically George Bush is God,
[02:23:40.636 --> 02:23:46.600]  And then they manipulate their staff using this, and of course Ashcroft's anointing people with oil.
[02:23:47.180 --> 02:23:50.342]  It's a psychological warfare program, in my opinion.
[02:23:50.482 --> 02:23:51.262]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:23:51.662 --> 02:23:58.566]  One of the ads I also ran last year was a chart, a table.
[02:23:59.147 --> 02:24:03.129]  One column of the table was Jesus, the other column of the table was Bush.
[02:24:03.609 --> 02:24:07.251]  I put what Jesus said, and I put what Bush said, and it was 180 degrees in every case.
[02:24:10.396 --> 02:24:18.552]  Well, Skull and Bones, MSNBC admits, is an occult organization, so why are these Christian groups still worshipping Bush?
[02:24:19.435 --> 02:24:21.176]  Well, he's got the PR.
[02:24:21.216 --> 02:24:23.056]  He comes in and says, I'm a born again.
[02:24:23.076 --> 02:24:24.597]  I believe in Jesus Christ.
[02:24:24.617 --> 02:24:27.958]  Of course, he doesn't practice anything Jesus Christ taught.
[02:24:27.998 --> 02:24:38.761]  These people are so blinded by their blind faith or fanatical faith and so happy that there's a born again in the White House.
[02:24:38.781 --> 02:24:44.743]  It gets them high to the point they don't think about what he's doing.
[02:24:45.470 --> 02:24:45.891]  I agree.
[02:24:46.512 --> 02:24:48.454]  It switches off the thinking process.
[02:24:48.875 --> 02:24:53.481]  The whole 9-11 thing was a very well-planned psychological stunt.
[02:24:54.061 --> 02:24:58.267]  They had time for those news events to hit perfectly right.
[02:24:58.775 --> 02:25:06.078]  They waited however long after the first one hit so the news cameras could be set up so they could record the second hit.
[02:25:06.419 --> 02:25:10.180]  They got lucky on the first one that one guy got the picture.
[02:25:10.740 --> 02:25:14.522]  But on the second one they planned the timing and then they planned the collapse.
[02:25:14.922 --> 02:25:18.024]  So it was like a boxer, give me the left, the right and the left.
[02:25:18.982 --> 02:25:19.942]  You're under attack.
[02:25:19.982 --> 02:25:27.766]  The blood leaves the thinking part of your brain, goes to the fight and flight part of your brain, and you become very impressionable by authority figures.
[02:25:27.786 --> 02:25:28.146]  Exactly.
[02:25:28.426 --> 02:25:32.568]  And then we got to learn with Bush at the same time and see the great leader discover it.
[02:25:32.588 --> 02:25:35.409]  Then he went to ground zero and, I'm going to save you.
[02:25:35.609 --> 02:25:37.090]  And then to watch their convention.
[02:25:37.110 --> 02:25:38.310]  I was in New York.
[02:25:38.330 --> 02:25:39.751]  What a disgusting display.
[02:25:40.371 --> 02:25:41.551]  It was very disgusting.
[02:25:42.192 --> 02:25:42.932]  I was there as well.
[02:25:42.972 --> 02:25:44.913]  I marched in the parade in my chicken hawk suit.
[02:25:45.513 --> 02:25:51.300]  I've got a flight suit with my own custom-designed badges, chicken-hot guards.
[02:25:51.380 --> 02:25:52.281]  Oh, I saw you!
[02:25:52.301 --> 02:25:52.962]  Didn't even know.
[02:25:53.182 --> 02:25:53.983]  Yeah, that was me.
[02:25:54.383 --> 02:26:05.636]  I've got a little car horn thing that I rigged up with batteries that plays like a chicken and crows like a rooster, and I walked down chanting this Jody or Catons that I made up.
[02:26:07.671 --> 02:26:16.014]  Well, it was exciting to see 10,000 signs handed out for the 9-11 Truth Movement interspersed there with a giant crowd of 300-plus thousand on Sunday.
[02:26:16.914 --> 02:26:18.494]  What do you think about Michael Moore's film?
[02:26:18.514 --> 02:26:21.315]  You know, he only scratches the surface, and look how much heat he got.
[02:26:21.935 --> 02:26:24.216]  Well, I love Michael Moore's film.
[02:26:25.196 --> 02:26:30.798]  I think, personally, the Bin Laden connection here about him letting them leave the country...
[02:26:32.040 --> 02:26:34.541]  It was a family personal thing.
[02:26:35.541 --> 02:26:38.042]  It's just like I said about Bush.
[02:26:38.382 --> 02:26:42.224]  If I was planning it, I wouldn't sit in the classroom and look like a fool for 40 minutes.
[02:26:42.564 --> 02:26:45.605]  I'd have had it looking so I was ready to go and on top of it.
[02:26:45.645 --> 02:26:46.885]  That's why I think he was out of the loop.
[02:26:47.325 --> 02:26:49.046]  I think the same thing with the Bin Laden family.
[02:26:49.326 --> 02:26:52.227]  That's like the Jones family where they've got so many members.
[02:26:52.287 --> 02:26:55.188]  A few of them happened to be here and he said, get them out of here.
[02:26:55.928 --> 02:27:00.730]  But Bush and those particular Bin Ladens were not in on it in my opinion.
[02:27:01.693 --> 02:27:08.779]  But other than that, Michael Moore really catches the spirit with that lady in Flint and how she must feel and change.
[02:27:08.839 --> 02:27:11.041]  That's the most stunning part of the whole thing.
[02:27:11.061 --> 02:27:13.663]  Yeah, I think the strongest part is the Iraq information.
[02:27:14.644 --> 02:27:18.487]  But clearly, Bush thought it was one of the drills that morning.
[02:27:19.228 --> 02:27:21.270]  Absolutely.
[02:27:21.690 --> 02:27:25.854]  And then he gets on later and lies and says, well, I thought that was one bad pilot.
[02:27:26.194 --> 02:27:27.815]  They knew the planes had been hijacked.
[02:27:29.315 --> 02:27:30.758]  I just thought it was a drill.
[02:27:30.838 --> 02:27:32.801]  We'll be right back with our guest and your call.
[02:27:32.841 --> 02:27:33.302]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.087 --> 02:27:36.988]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.489 --> 02:27:39.092]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.013 --> 02:27:42.698]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.655 --> 02:27:45.815]  Call 800-348-4100.
[02:27:45.835 --> 02:27:46.015]  That's 800-348-4100.
[02:28:15.618 --> 02:28:16.559]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.
[02:28:16.599 --> 02:28:23.785]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[02:28:24.045 --> 02:28:26.947]  Sponsorship is critical at both local and national levels.
[02:28:27.147 --> 02:28:32.832]  If you have a business product or message that could benefit from this broadcast locally, call the station you're listening to.
[02:28:33.092 --> 02:28:35.634]  For national exposure, call 877-996-4327.
[02:28:37.576 --> 02:28:42.059]  Become a part of the Genesis team by calling your local station or call the national line at 877-996-4327.
[02:28:46.187 --> 02:28:46.567]  Thank you.
[02:29:09.811 --> 02:29:19.702]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:29:19.802 --> 02:29:28.652]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:29:28.852 --> 02:29:30.133]  Call now and get free shipping.
[02:29:30.193 --> 02:29:30.533]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.721 --> 02:29:46.222]  I think?
[02:30:00.441 --> 02:30:04.364]  PTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:30:04.484 --> 02:30:04.924]  Fragrance?
[02:30:05.305 --> 02:30:10.068]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:30:10.188 --> 02:30:14.892]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[02:30:15.112 --> 02:30:17.674]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[02:30:17.914 --> 02:30:21.336]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:30:21.476 --> 02:30:24.999]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:30:25.219 --> 02:30:27.561]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:30:27.741 --> 02:30:28.622]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:30:28.742 --> 02:30:38.491]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.
[02:30:38.691 --> 02:30:41.173]  Call Cal Bend toll free, 1-800-340-7091 or visit CalBendPureSoap.com.
[02:30:54.692 --> 02:31:10.306]  Alright, we're going to go to your calls quickly, but before we do that, I was just talking to Jimmy Walter.
[02:31:11.440 --> 02:31:18.702]  The guy's now purchased a million dollars worth of ads to expose 9-11 promoting information that he believes in.
[02:31:19.202 --> 02:31:20.783]  And I'm talking to him on and off air.
[02:31:20.823 --> 02:31:22.083]  He's very, very informed.
[02:31:22.103 --> 02:31:29.325]  I should have gone to that 9-11 truth omission committee on September 9th and 10th and 11th.
[02:31:29.345 --> 02:31:37.727]  But I, again, had been in New York for a week and had to get back to the radio show and work on a new film I'm making about New York called Martial Law, how they occupied the city and are training us for this.
[02:31:37.767 --> 02:31:39.048]  But we'll go to your calls in a minute.
[02:31:39.068 --> 02:31:39.828]  But during the break...
[02:31:40.949 --> 02:31:48.433]  Myself and Jimmy were talking about how they could easily release biologicals, chemicals, radiologicals and cancel the election.
[02:31:48.513 --> 02:31:49.794]  I knew about this a year ago.
[02:31:50.154 --> 02:31:54.037]  The last six months Ridge and others have been out there talking about it on a monthly basis.
[02:31:54.437 --> 02:31:57.259]  Now they're doing drills on how to shut down New York and take over.
[02:31:57.979 --> 02:32:02.061]  And we already had one president appointed by the Supreme Court, folks.
[02:32:02.461 --> 02:32:04.802]  We have the CIA-run voting machines going in.
[02:32:05.222 --> 02:32:07.502]  But if they don't think that'll work, they will pull something.
[02:32:08.443 --> 02:32:22.468]  It's not as if Kerry's even different, but you have this junta, or this junta, as they say, that wants to stay in power, and he's been so good for the globalists because he's neutralized good conservatives that there's no end to how far they'll go.
[02:32:22.488 --> 02:32:23.548]  They've already gone this far.
[02:32:23.868 --> 02:32:25.769]  That's why exposing them now...
[02:32:26.349 --> 02:32:28.609]  Well, thank you very much, Alex.
[02:32:28.629 --> 02:32:30.210]  I'm doing what I think is my part.
[02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:33.470]  In other words, I've always felt that people with money have a responsibility.
[02:32:33.490 --> 02:32:37.271]  There's no way that I deserve this amount of money that I inherited.
[02:32:53.593 --> 02:32:59.016]  It looked to me like this was a unique opportunity to use that money because no one else was doing it.
[02:32:59.036 --> 02:33:01.357]  It's a total vacuum.
[02:33:01.617 --> 02:33:04.699]  I could step in here and bring to the lights and stuff.
[02:33:04.719 --> 02:33:07.480]  The whole point of our ads, I'm not trying to make money.
[02:33:07.740 --> 02:33:09.901]  We're actually bundling products now.
[02:33:10.222 --> 02:33:12.103]  We're trying to make the ads have legs.
[02:33:12.703 --> 02:33:18.266]  By that I mean where enough money comes back in sales to run more ads.
[02:33:18.326 --> 02:33:22.348]  I'm putting everything I make out of this back into more ads across the country.
[02:33:23.925 --> 02:33:29.107]  Well, that's exciting, but you had to just fund the Iraq ads out of your pocket.
[02:33:29.407 --> 02:33:31.708]  I've funded all of these ads out of my pocket so far.
[02:33:32.849 --> 02:33:36.970]  The amount of money I've gotten sales out of the Iraq ads had nothing coming back.
[02:33:37.350 --> 02:33:44.373]  These ads for Eric have a little bit coming back, but it's cheaper to give them away, as I like to joke.
[02:33:47.134 --> 02:33:51.356]  But this election thing, I wanted to talk a little bit on that, because we were talking about that before.
[02:33:53.797 --> 02:34:05.053]  In my opinion, the latest polls by the same numerous organizations that are obscuring and covering up and self-censoring the truth showed Bush had this 11-point bounce.
[02:34:05.694 --> 02:34:07.937]  But the Zogby polls showed no change.
[02:34:08.752 --> 02:34:17.643]  And what I see them doing here is they're using these polls as a front to say, look, Bush is ahead in the polls.
[02:34:18.024 --> 02:34:20.687]  And then the electronic voting machines are going to confirm it.
[02:34:20.947 --> 02:34:27.376]  And that creates this sheep mentality where people think, oh, he's winning, I better go with him.
[02:34:27.796 --> 02:34:27.996]  Right.
[02:34:28.376 --> 02:34:30.757]  And again, this is how you manipulate an election, and exactly.
[02:34:30.797 --> 02:34:32.157]  Zogby's highly respected.
[02:34:32.557 --> 02:34:42.939]  Their numbers have been proven to be accurate over and over again, or more accurate, and some of these big CNN USA Today polls aren't worth the paper, you know, and the ink that they're printed on.
[02:34:43.679 --> 02:34:48.200]  Well, you know, they used to say about accounting, figures don't lie, but liars figure.
[02:34:49.601 --> 02:34:53.422]  And a lot of it depends on how you ask the question, how you frame the question.
[02:34:53.702 --> 02:34:55.582]  If you say, do you support the president...
[02:34:56.326 --> 02:34:57.527]  People tend to say yes.
[02:34:57.607 --> 02:35:01.790]  If you say, do you support Mr. Bush, you get a lot less positive.
[02:35:04.391 --> 02:35:05.132]  Absolutely.
[02:35:05.292 --> 02:35:09.355]  It's disgusting how they do this.
[02:35:09.455 --> 02:35:12.977]  But I was in New York and 80% of people I talked to hated the fact...
[02:35:13.556 --> 02:35:15.897]  They said, they're coming back here to capitalize on the deaths.
[02:35:15.937 --> 02:35:16.977]  We think they're involved.
[02:35:17.297 --> 02:35:18.337]  And then you watch the news.
[02:35:18.437 --> 02:35:19.398]  Everybody loves it.
[02:35:19.438 --> 02:35:20.258]  Everything's happy.
[02:35:20.298 --> 02:35:20.918]  Everything's good.
[02:35:21.238 --> 02:35:23.399]  Meanwhile, cops are beating people with billy clubs.
[02:35:23.419 --> 02:35:24.779]  They've got sound wave cannons.
[02:35:25.039 --> 02:35:29.080]  They put 2,000 people in an old run-down facility on the Hudson River.
[02:35:29.100 --> 02:35:30.381]  I mean, it was amazing.
[02:35:31.201 --> 02:35:32.081]  And they used nets.
[02:35:32.621 --> 02:35:34.322]  They didn't tell people.
[02:35:34.902 --> 02:35:37.803]  Most of the people could not hear them say to disperse.
[02:35:38.800 --> 02:35:43.201]  And then they come up with these huge orange necks and swoop up the whole crowd.
[02:35:43.221 --> 02:35:45.582]  Well, they'd block both sides of the street so you couldn't escape.
[02:35:46.382 --> 02:35:48.562]  And it was not done by the average cop.
[02:35:49.002 --> 02:35:51.923]  All of that was initiated by the upper ranks.
[02:35:51.943 --> 02:35:54.864]  No, they would go and order them to do it.
[02:35:55.144 --> 02:35:55.384]  Right.
[02:35:55.764 --> 02:35:58.364]  And later, police would apologize to the people they'd arrested.
[02:35:59.245 --> 02:36:04.886]  I walked around New York in my uniform carrying a sign that said, Fair Pay for Police and Firemen.
[02:36:05.928 --> 02:36:07.389]  The police were saluting me.
[02:36:07.769 --> 02:36:09.590]  They were saying, God bless you.
[02:36:10.290 --> 02:36:11.310]  I never got arrested.
[02:36:12.911 --> 02:36:15.752]  It's amazing what happened in New York.
[02:36:15.932 --> 02:36:17.273]  They occupied New York.
[02:36:17.333 --> 02:36:18.633]  That was martial law.
[02:36:19.574 --> 02:36:21.255]  It's about as close as you're going to get.
[02:36:23.109 --> 02:36:27.332]  What they're not telling you, in Bloomberg in particular, is the city was empty.
[02:36:27.692 --> 02:36:30.533]  They got KO'd on sales.
[02:36:31.014 --> 02:36:32.415]  You could get a cab any time.
[02:36:32.455 --> 02:36:34.116]  The poor cab drivers were starving.
[02:36:34.136 --> 02:36:40.399]  There were 10 cabs lined up, and people said in 18 years it's never been this bad.
[02:36:40.719 --> 02:36:41.000]  Right.
[02:36:42.200 --> 02:36:45.782]  It cost New York City $350 million out of the government pocket.
[02:36:46.263 --> 02:36:50.105]  I'll bet it cost New York City a billion dollars total in lost revenue.
[02:36:52.193 --> 02:36:52.993]  It's incredible.
[02:36:53.454 --> 02:36:55.335]  Let's go ahead and take some calls.
[02:36:55.455 --> 02:36:59.276]  Everything he's saying, I witnessed myself there on the ground.
[02:37:00.217 --> 02:37:03.098]  Let's go ahead and talk to Lee in West Virginia.
[02:37:03.158 --> 02:37:03.919]  Lee, you're on the air.
[02:37:03.979 --> 02:37:04.379]  Go ahead.
[02:37:04.399 --> 02:37:06.120]  Hello, Alex.
[02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:10.702]  Can I talk about the International Democrat Union?
[02:37:12.083 --> 02:37:14.164]  Okay, I know you were holding since earlier, but go ahead, sir.
[02:37:14.924 --> 02:37:18.306]  All right, well, I have a quick question from the net that I'd like to share with you.
[02:37:18.466 --> 02:37:19.046]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:37:19.654 --> 02:37:32.558]  The Republican Party has the International Leadership Program, which is currently managed by the International Fund for Democratic Capitalism, which in turn serves the International Democrat Union.
[02:37:33.078 --> 02:37:36.159]  The Republican Party is a member of the International Democrat Union.
[02:37:36.379 --> 02:37:36.679]  Yes.
[02:37:37.379 --> 02:37:48.862]  And it says on its page there, IDU homepage, the International Democrat Union is the freedom international
[02:37:49.375 --> 02:37:59.522]  A working association of over 80 conservative Christian Democrats and like-minded political parties of the center and center-right.
[02:38:00.182 --> 02:38:16.854]  All right, now I went to another website to get a definition of Christian democracy, which is a political ideology born at the end of the 19th century with a papal, encyclical, rerum novarum,
[02:38:17.355 --> 02:38:18.996]  This is a little bit over my head.
[02:38:19.536 --> 02:38:21.077]  I'm not... Let me boil it down, sir.
[02:38:21.197 --> 02:38:24.680]  What are you getting at?
[02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:27.842]  It's... I'm getting at the fact that it also has...
[02:38:43.872 --> 02:38:54.345]  According to ArabicNews.com, also a member of the Istiklal Party of Morocco, which is Arab and Muslim.
[02:38:55.226 --> 02:39:03.796]  The point I want to try to make is, it seems like that Bush wants to be a Caesar, insofar as he wants to be Pontifex Maximus.
[02:39:05.020 --> 02:39:05.901]  That's a great point.
[02:39:06.001 --> 02:39:07.122]  Email me that information.
[02:39:07.142 --> 02:39:16.949]  Yes, I'm aware that they're trying to infiltrate, manipulate all these different religious groups, Christian, Muslim, you name it, and, like, somehow, I was aware of that, like, George Bush is God.
[02:39:16.969 --> 02:39:19.791]  I think that's what our guest was getting into earlier.
[02:39:20.031 --> 02:39:20.251]  Yes.
[02:39:20.552 --> 02:39:21.552]  Can I make one last statement?
[02:39:21.572 --> 02:39:21.812]  Sure.
[02:39:21.833 --> 02:39:27.877]  The Murano John Cohen, converted, and is now the Mishumad Kerry Christian,
[02:39:28.987 --> 02:39:31.229]  Okay, okay.
[02:39:33.051 --> 02:39:38.014]  I appreciate the call, sir.
[02:39:38.094 --> 02:39:40.156]  I have trouble following a lot of that.
[02:39:40.256 --> 02:39:41.257]  Dave in Illinois.
[02:39:41.297 --> 02:39:42.098]  Dave, you're on the air.
[02:39:42.198 --> 02:39:42.638]  Go ahead.
[02:39:42.658 --> 02:39:47.162]  Yeah, I just wanted to touch again on the divisiveness issue.
[02:39:47.182 --> 02:39:52.806]  The guy who was asking what we could do to fight or whatever.
[02:39:52.826 --> 02:39:56.869]  I think it's real close to what we're doing now.
[02:39:56.889 --> 02:39:57.189]  You have the
[02:39:58.211 --> 02:40:00.173]  Republicans, they watch the Democrats.
[02:40:00.273 --> 02:40:05.176]  Democrats, they watch Republicans, but they're so divisive that they can't, you know, see the real picture.
[02:40:05.877 --> 02:40:08.939]  And what Jim Walter's doing will break that.
[02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:19.287]  Yeah, and, you know, the divisiveness, you know, there's divisiveness in everything, and it really, it's one of the biggest things holding our thing back.
[02:40:19.848 --> 02:40:26.313]  And, you know, like you said, he's going to have, you know, communists come in and say, oh, he's got some kind of ulterior motive or something, but...
[02:40:27.199 --> 02:40:37.182]  You know, everyone wants to kill the messenger, and it's just, you know, every movement's going to be infiltrated.
[02:40:38.142 --> 02:40:42.644]  That's why we as individuals have to be leaders, have to move forward with the facts that we have.
[02:40:42.664 --> 02:40:43.464]  Thanks for the call.
[02:40:43.864 --> 02:40:45.885]  Any comments to what he was saying, Jimmy?
[02:40:46.665 --> 02:40:48.446]  Well, it's exactly right.
[02:40:49.026 --> 02:40:52.587]  The 9-1 Commission was a bipartisan commission.
[02:40:53.514 --> 02:40:54.575]  We can't forget that.
[02:40:54.635 --> 02:41:01.641]  The Democrats gave him all the powers, and even Kerry can't get it up to say that he wouldn't do it now.
[02:41:03.583 --> 02:41:08.307]  The Democrats and Republicans are working too closely together on this, for my taste.
[02:41:09.328 --> 02:41:20.278]  It's a strategy that they're trying to be as centrist as possible to get the most possible votes, but in doing so, they don't differentiate themselves from Bush, and Bush has the power of the office.
[02:41:21.693 --> 02:41:24.475]  Well, listening to Kerry half the time, it sounds like George Bush.
[02:41:25.555 --> 02:41:31.799]  If you look at their written platforms, it's hard to tell a difference.
[02:41:32.700 --> 02:41:33.380]  Absolutely.
[02:41:34.120 --> 02:41:35.601]  Mike in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:41:35.661 --> 02:41:36.142]  Go ahead.
[02:41:36.822 --> 02:41:42.305]  Yeah, I just kind of had this little thought question kind of indecisive here.
[02:41:42.365 --> 02:41:44.787]  I'm not asking you to think for myself, but...
[02:41:45.799 --> 02:41:47.040]  Who do you, like, really vote for?
[02:41:47.080 --> 02:41:50.901]  Like, I mean, you vote for Bush or you vote for Kerry, it's a vote for tyranny, right?
[02:41:52.722 --> 02:42:06.148]  I personally think that we need to focus on county, city, state, and congressional elections and vote for people, whether they're Republicans, Democrats, Libertarians, Greens, who are on the record for the Bill of Rights, for the Constitution, against this war.
[02:42:06.608 --> 02:42:07.969]  Right, and I agree with this.
[02:42:08.109 --> 02:42:10.110]  It's like, we've got to get that Bush guy out of there.
[02:42:10.271 --> 02:42:13.132]  But, like, you know, Kerry goes in, he's just going to carry on.
[02:42:13.373 --> 02:42:15.914]  This is the only reason I say Bush is more dangerous.
[02:42:16.255 --> 02:42:16.475]  Yeah?
[02:42:16.715 --> 02:42:17.095]  Okay?
[02:42:17.555 --> 02:42:20.237]  Is because he's conned good conservatives.
[02:42:20.297 --> 02:42:36.408]  If a Democrat goes in and tries all this stuff, suddenly conservatives are going to wake up, and a lot of the liberals are now so against the war and all this stuff that they're not going to go along with Kerry either, and so you're going to have somebody who's got to get the whole criminal enterprise rolling again, whereas Bush already has the whole thing in place.
[02:42:36.688 --> 02:42:39.750]  Now that's a Machiavellian way to look at it, but do you have any comments, Jimmy?
[02:42:40.391 --> 02:42:45.894]  Well, again, just because you're Democrat or Republican doesn't make you bad or good.
[02:42:46.234 --> 02:42:47.915]  You have to look at the individual.
[02:42:48.256 --> 02:42:53.419]  My Democratic friends give me grief about this, but I'll support a Republican who's against Bush.
[02:42:54.420 --> 02:42:57.662]  Because you can guess that Tom DeLay, the...
[02:42:59.379 --> 02:43:05.023]  The head of the SS troops will try to defeat any Republican who goes against what he says.
[02:43:05.103 --> 02:43:06.244]  So we've got to support.
[02:43:06.544 --> 02:43:07.765]  We've got to be smart about it.
[02:43:08.825 --> 02:43:15.250]  If the Democrat has no chance or is supporting the war, then we go with the Republican or the Libertarian.
[02:43:15.810 --> 02:43:23.335]  But as far as the major election goes, it may look like only a slight difference, but if Bush wins again,
[02:43:24.013 --> 02:43:34.182]  The gloves come off, and his stated platform will be so tame compared to his real platform that we probably won't survive.
[02:43:34.642 --> 02:43:35.023]  All right.
[02:43:35.223 --> 02:43:36.504]  Thanks for answering my question.
[02:43:36.784 --> 02:43:37.325]  All right.
[02:43:37.585 --> 02:43:38.366]  Thanks for the call.
[02:43:39.066 --> 02:43:40.427]  Carlos in California.
[02:43:40.467 --> 02:43:41.568]  Carlos, you're on the air.
[02:43:41.608 --> 02:43:42.369]  Welcome, Carlos.
[02:43:43.110 --> 02:43:44.771]  Yes, Mr. Walters.
[02:43:44.991 --> 02:43:46.393]  I truly admire you, sir.
[02:43:46.433 --> 02:43:47.333]  You're very courageous.
[02:43:52.266 --> 02:43:55.029]  But you know, there's so much deception that was going on with 9-11.
[02:43:56.570 --> 02:44:02.415]  You know, you got all kinds of prefabricated evidence linking the Bin Ladens to the attack.
[02:44:02.455 --> 02:44:13.204]  You got all these, you got the Muslims, they're getting drunk the night before in houses of your repute so conveniently and leaving the Koran there so conveniently.
[02:44:13.404 --> 02:44:16.367]  And then passports magically fall out of the skies.
[02:44:17.225 --> 02:44:21.608]  Well, there were no Arabs on the manifesto flight 77 that allegedly hit the Pentagon.
[02:44:21.648 --> 02:44:23.309]  Not a single Arab was on that plane.
[02:44:24.529 --> 02:44:42.720]  Well, you know, and then you got Mohammed Atta supposedly taking a flight on the very same day as 9-11, early in the morning from Portland, Maine, going to connect to Boston, where he's supposed to have got the other flight that crashed into the towers, with only a few minutes separating the connections.
[02:44:42.800 --> 02:44:45.602]  I mean, does that make sense from...
[02:44:46.642 --> 02:44:47.683]  Here's another thing.
[02:44:47.703 --> 02:44:50.105]  The guy couldn't pass flight school.
[02:44:50.265 --> 02:44:51.946]  None of these guys could fly.
[02:44:52.006 --> 02:44:53.347]  Well, here's another thing.
[02:44:53.427 --> 02:44:54.668]  This is another key point.
[02:45:05.266 --> 02:45:15.449]  All four of the airlines, or two different airlines, all four of the aircraft had exactly 20.3% occupancy because of computer failures on a day when occupancy was over 85%.
[02:45:16.609 --> 02:45:19.790]  So magically, most people didn't get on those planes.
[02:45:20.270 --> 02:45:21.891]  All of it stinks to high heaven.
[02:45:22.111 --> 02:45:24.031]  But take that to another level, Alex.
[02:45:24.732 --> 02:45:30.313]  From Operation Northwoods, we knew that the government had planned... To stage putting people on aircraft?
[02:45:30.413 --> 02:45:47.727]  Well, you know, I think the whole thing is a decoy, just like Lee Harvey Oswald was a decoy, and the real perpetrators are getting away out there somewhere.
[02:45:48.780 --> 02:45:58.531]  And what we need is another 9-11 commission revisited, this time by members of the actual victims of 9-11.
[02:45:58.731 --> 02:46:01.995]  Well, it depends on who's in power.
[02:46:02.015 --> 02:46:05.339]  If it's going to be another Republican 9-11 commission, why waste the money?
[02:46:05.379 --> 02:46:07.221]  What we need is a special prosecutor.
[02:46:07.938 --> 02:46:20.801]  Well, what we need is to just have hundreds of meetings around the country on a monthly basis, put up signs, get out videos, make copies of videos, educate everybody, and just continue all of us on a low level.
[02:46:20.861 --> 02:46:26.223]  You can put a little quarter page ad in your local newspaper, or put one every week on the green sheets.
[02:46:27.543 --> 02:46:28.844]  Get your own local radio show.
[02:46:28.884 --> 02:46:29.924]  Put up your own websites.
[02:46:29.984 --> 02:46:31.204]  More 9-11 websites.
[02:46:31.704 --> 02:46:33.705]  All of us, millions of us that are awake...
[02:46:34.766 --> 02:46:37.068]  The few educate the many who educate the mass.
[02:46:38.049 --> 02:46:44.113]  In that vein, we maybe want to copy move on and have people do house parties to show the videos.
[02:46:44.573 --> 02:46:47.895]  I tell you, it takes the video to convince people.
[02:46:47.935 --> 02:46:48.976]  I've given people the books.
[02:46:49.557 --> 02:46:52.679]  Books are good, but the video knocks them over.
[02:46:52.919 --> 02:46:53.379]  Absolutely.
[02:46:53.419 --> 02:46:54.280]  Thank you, Carlos.
[02:46:55.120 --> 02:46:56.421]  Dan in Colorado.
[02:46:56.461 --> 02:46:57.162]  Dan, you're on the air.
[02:46:57.242 --> 02:46:57.662]  Go ahead.
[02:46:57.682 --> 02:47:02.366]  Alex, first of all, I want to thank Jim for these ads.
[02:47:02.426 --> 02:47:02.806]  Thank you.
[02:47:03.467 --> 02:47:07.069]  Yes, and we're going to get up to 85% like Alex was talking about.
[02:47:07.109 --> 02:47:07.589]  That's great.
[02:47:08.830 --> 02:47:15.634]  A friend of mine was going down to southern Colorado recently and he picked up a couple of local newspapers.
[02:47:16.174 --> 02:47:21.057]  They're talking about mass vaccinations and starting out with nine counties in southern Colorado.
[02:47:22.429 --> 02:47:26.753]  Yeah, forced inoculations is also part of Bush's BioShield program.
[02:47:27.014 --> 02:47:30.237]  It's really a cover for a giant biological weapons development system.
[02:47:30.517 --> 02:47:37.664]  And PNAC talks about how they want to legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons right out of Joseph Mingle's own mouth.
[02:47:40.007 --> 02:47:42.169]  This is scheduled for October 16th.
[02:47:44.872 --> 02:47:50.296]  To do an exercise where they inoculate people in nine southern counties.
[02:47:50.617 --> 02:47:52.938]  Now, this is a simulated forced inoculation?
[02:47:53.479 --> 02:47:53.939]  No, no.
[02:47:53.979 --> 02:47:56.060]  The forced one comes after this.
[02:47:56.100 --> 02:47:57.862]  They start out on October 16th.
[02:47:57.942 --> 02:48:02.525]  They say, October 16th, we want people to be inoculated with flu vaccines.
[02:48:03.137 --> 02:48:05.379]  But it's probably not just flu vaccine.
[02:48:05.419 --> 02:48:06.980]  That's why it's so important.
[02:48:07.040 --> 02:48:11.803]  Well, we know about the Model State Health Emergency Powers Act, and it's passed on page 76 of Homeland Security.
[02:48:12.324 --> 02:48:16.267]  Very, very scary, setting a precedent to force you to take things into your body.
[02:48:17.147 --> 02:48:17.908]  Thanks for the call.
[02:48:17.928 --> 02:48:27.615]  We'll come back with a final segment with our guest, Jimmy Walter, doing an amazing job, and we should all pray for him and just thank God for what he's doing.
[02:48:27.655 --> 02:48:27.775]  It's a
[02:48:28.940 --> 02:48:29.762]  Very exciting.
[02:48:30.143 --> 02:48:34.792]  PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv are the websites.
[02:48:34.832 --> 02:48:36.335]  We'll be right back with our guests.
[02:48:36.355 --> 02:48:36.836]  Stay with us.
[02:48:45.879 --> 02:48:52.724]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:53.025 --> 02:48:54.406]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:54.586 --> 02:48:56.808]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:56.968 --> 02:48:59.049]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:59.310 --> 02:49:04.253]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:04.594 --> 02:49:08.617]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:08.857 --> 02:49:09.318]  We're good to go.
[02:49:23.814 --> 02:49:23.994]  That's 888-2533-139.
[02:49:24.074 --> 02:49:25.995]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[02:49:26.015 --> 02:49:26.696]  Again, that number, 888-2533-139.
[02:49:45.417 --> 02:49:48.979]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:49:49.039 --> 02:49:49.539]  are located?
[02:49:49.759 --> 02:49:53.141]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 crime terrorist targets?
[02:49:53.361 --> 02:49:58.064]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[02:49:58.344 --> 02:50:09.610]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas, brewing environmental catastrophes, the safest cities, the best places for solar and wind energy, and much, much more.
[02:50:09.710 --> 02:50:10.310]  We're good to go.
[02:50:37.762 --> 02:50:39.183]  We're good to go.
[02:51:01.463 --> 02:51:02.124]  We're good to go.
[02:51:17.014 --> 02:51:17.534]  We're good to go.
[02:51:17.554 --> 02:51:17.854]  I think?
[02:51:48.820 --> 02:51:49.280]  Don't worry.
[02:51:49.800 --> 02:51:51.360]  This show is documented.
[02:51:51.841 --> 02:51:55.121]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:55.941 --> 02:51:56.701]  That's right, folks.
[02:51:56.721 --> 02:51:58.062]  The truth always comes out.
[02:51:58.562 --> 02:52:05.303]  Might as well admit the world's round now and join, well, half the New Yorkers who believe the government was behind 9-11.
[02:52:05.343 --> 02:52:11.344]  I've done over 1,600 radio interviews in the last three years, and almost every caller we talk to agrees with us.
[02:52:11.944 --> 02:52:14.185]  The illusion is that people aren't waking up.
[02:52:14.345 --> 02:52:15.165]  The truth is they are.
[02:52:16.167 --> 02:52:19.350]  Daryl in Pennsylvania, you're on the air with our guest, Jimmy Walter.
[02:52:19.770 --> 02:52:31.479]  Hey, Jimmy, I just wanted to tell you real quickly, I'm a 20-year military veteran who spent 26 years in the intelligence community, and I'm begging and pleading with you, you've got to see Alex's two videos on 9-1-1.
[02:52:31.499 --> 02:52:34.461]  9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, and The Masters of Terror.
[02:52:34.821 --> 02:52:39.185]  I just beg you to take a look at those two, because I've got over 100 different videos.
[02:52:39.225 --> 02:52:42.227]  I've got all the ones that you've put out so far, Huffnagle and Massachusetts.
[02:52:42.557 --> 02:52:45.560]  You've been sponsoring, and just beg you, please take a look at Alex.
[02:52:45.580 --> 02:52:48.262]  Well, he's overnighting on the meet tonight, and I'm going to look at him tomorrow.
[02:52:48.562 --> 02:52:51.045]  And God bless you, sir, and thank you for what you're doing.
[02:52:51.165 --> 02:52:52.346]  Well, thank you for thanking me.
[02:52:53.387 --> 02:52:55.969]  Well, Darrell, that sounds like a setup, but it wasn't, but thank you.
[02:52:56.009 --> 02:52:57.751]  Yeah, I sure hope and pray he does.
[02:52:57.831 --> 02:52:59.572]  Alex, everybody talks about you.
[02:52:59.752 --> 02:53:00.153]  Everybody.
[02:53:01.050 --> 02:53:03.552]  Oh, listen, I've got it on video in the crowds.
[02:53:03.592 --> 02:53:10.038]  I probably had 500 people come up to me from New York, and I even saw folks there with copies of my videos handing them out.
[02:53:10.118 --> 02:53:11.499]  So I'm just one guy, though.
[02:53:11.619 --> 02:53:12.660]  All of us have to be leaders.
[02:53:13.001 --> 02:53:14.942]  I'm just as excited about you doing other people.
[02:53:15.002 --> 02:53:15.723]  I'm just as glad.
[02:53:16.063 --> 02:53:18.586]  My family doesn't have a future if we don't defeat this.
[02:53:19.686 --> 02:53:21.108]  So, I mean, we're all in this together.
[02:53:21.188 --> 02:53:22.709]  Just God bless you, Jimmy.
[02:53:22.729 --> 02:53:23.630]  You're doing a great job.
[02:53:23.770 --> 02:53:28.094]  Even though I don't like to do it because I get so much flack,
[02:53:28.837 --> 02:53:32.958]  It really is a Reichstag fire type event, one way or the other.
[02:53:33.018 --> 02:53:39.080]  Because it's so summer, Hitler used that to take away rights, and then it just got worse and worse.
[02:53:39.100 --> 02:53:40.181]  Well, that's what I document.
[02:53:40.201 --> 02:53:41.581]  That's how Road to Tyranny starts.
[02:53:41.881 --> 02:53:43.141]  Yeah.
[02:53:43.221 --> 02:53:43.622]  Exactly.
[02:53:43.682 --> 02:53:44.562]  No, we're on the same page.
[02:53:45.142 --> 02:53:46.262]  James in Texas, go ahead.
[02:53:46.282 --> 02:53:47.163]  You're on the air with our guest.
[02:53:47.643 --> 02:53:48.883]  Thanks a lot, both of you guys.
[02:53:49.623 --> 02:53:53.144]  It's really brilliant the way you distributed the ads across the spectrum.
[02:53:53.184 --> 02:53:54.285]  You've got conservative and liberal.
[02:53:54.305 --> 02:53:57.986]  You've got the Business Week and Reader's Digest and the conservative and the Newsweek and the other...
[02:53:58.601 --> 02:53:59.302]  That was good.
[02:53:59.482 --> 02:54:00.563]  Really brilliant.
[02:54:01.283 --> 02:54:07.308]  I don't believe that the average business leader in this country knows what's happened or they wouldn't allow it to happen either.
[02:54:07.328 --> 02:54:10.450]  That's why it was good.
[02:54:10.811 --> 02:54:13.893]  They're only getting their news from the mainstream press.
[02:54:14.974 --> 02:54:18.437]  There's a famous line from Ishmael.
[02:54:19.176 --> 02:54:22.959]  If the world is saved, it will be saved by changed minds.
[02:54:23.519 --> 02:54:24.020]  Exactly.
[02:54:24.080 --> 02:54:25.441]  And let me add this.
[02:54:25.641 --> 02:54:32.726]  Just the ads running and people seeing that it's mainstream and that there's money behind it, a lot of people pay attention to that.
[02:54:33.167 --> 02:54:36.109]  This will raise the credibility just having the ads.
[02:54:36.169 --> 02:54:39.311]  I mean, I hope you run an ad about the Zogby poll so they can't cover that up.
[02:54:39.491 --> 02:54:41.953]  That's the headline of the next ad.
[02:54:42.213 --> 02:54:42.914]  Oh, unbelievable.
[02:54:43.034 --> 02:54:45.656]  Alex, I've got to tell you something.
[02:54:46.867 --> 02:54:53.049]  I checked out the website for PBS, and you cannot get... They're not selling Mercury Builds anymore.
[02:54:53.629 --> 02:54:57.630]  So that just verifies how important that video is.
[02:54:58.190 --> 02:55:03.632]  I checked it a couple weeks ago to see if they were scheduled to show it on the weekend of 9-11.
[02:55:04.955 --> 02:55:11.919]  Nationally, but I checked each local listing, and every time I checked a major local listing, they weren't showing it.
[02:55:12.239 --> 02:55:15.261]  Again, that's where the government, that's where the owner admits they blew up WPC7.
[02:55:15.281 --> 02:55:16.702]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:17.162 --> 02:55:18.023]  Great points, James.
[02:55:18.683 --> 02:55:20.724]  Eli in Detroit, last caller we have time for.
[02:55:20.744 --> 02:55:21.425]  Go ahead, Eli.
[02:55:21.665 --> 02:55:22.185]  Yeah, hi.
[02:55:22.325 --> 02:55:29.470]  Look in the Detroit Free Press yesterday at the bottom of the front page, and you'll see quite an article on foiling a bomb plot.
[02:55:29.590 --> 02:55:30.110]  Did you see that?
[02:55:30.839 --> 02:55:31.659]  No, I didn't.
[02:55:31.919 --> 02:55:43.143]  Austin Kalski is arrested and placed on a $1.35 million bond based on a tip from a person he was sending increasingly violent messages.
[02:55:43.203 --> 02:55:45.444]  He called himself Nazi by statistics.
[02:55:45.924 --> 02:55:46.524]  Sadistic.
[02:55:47.476 --> 02:55:48.657]  We're out of time.
[02:55:48.677 --> 02:55:52.059]  We're out of time.
[02:55:52.199 --> 02:55:54.921]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[02:55:54.981 --> 02:55:55.781]  Got to let you go.
[02:55:55.801 --> 02:55:56.622]  We're out of time.
[02:55:57.102 --> 02:55:59.363]  Is there a website people can check out, Jimmy?
[02:56:05.985 --> 02:56:07.445]  Walden, the number three dot org.
[02:56:07.505 --> 02:56:09.966]  All right, I'll be talking to you soon, sir.
[02:56:10.046 --> 02:56:15.607]  I really appreciate you coming on the broadcast, and I appreciate the work you've done.
[02:56:15.627 --> 02:56:19.308]  This is so incredibly exciting, and Godspeed to what you're doing.
[02:56:19.628 --> 02:56:21.769]  Thank you, Alex, and we'll talk soon.
[02:56:22.449 --> 02:56:23.649]  All right, take care, my friend.
[02:56:23.669 --> 02:56:24.670]  Take care of yourself.
[02:56:24.970 --> 02:56:25.670]  All right, bye-bye.
[02:56:25.750 --> 02:56:29.771]  Folks, I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, back tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central Standard Time.
[02:56:30.151 --> 02:56:31.091]  Be sure and join us.
[02:56:31.131 --> 02:56:32.792]  Now get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:33.032 --> 02:56:33.932]  We shall prevail.
