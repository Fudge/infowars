[00:00:05.632 --> 00:00:06.273]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.953 --> 00:00:08.013]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.713 --> 00:00:09.833]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.454 --> 00:00:11.294]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.034 --> 00:00:12.934]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.614 --> 00:00:17.295]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:21.856]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:36.940]  Alright my friends, big broadcast lined up for you today, the 26th of October 2004 on this Tuesday.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.223]  In less than seven days, the big election day will be commencing and we'll see what develops.
[00:00:44.823 --> 00:00:49.186]  There is massive election fraud going on by voting machines coast to coast.
[00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:55.148]  There's the type of retail vote stealing of people, double registering or registering dead people.
[00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:58.150]  So there's the high-tech and the low-tech stuff going on.
[00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:09.113]  Here in Austin, Texas, the Statesman and News 8 have reported that when you go in to vote a straight Democratic ticket, at the bottom it says you voted for George Bush.
[00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:16.997]  If you don't read the fine print, that's actually a vote for George Bush and Dick Cheney, and they're looking into that and not sure quite why that's happening.
[00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:22.439]  But again, I mean, I don't have to travel outside my city, where I live, to see this going on.
[00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.842]  Of course, Clear Channel, through Hart InterCivics, owns those machines here in Travis County, Williamson, and Hays.
[00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:35.304]  So we'll be tracking the election and talking about it and there's just so much there.
[00:01:35.724 --> 00:01:37.466]  Huge broadcast lined up today.
[00:01:37.486 --> 00:01:40.669]  Thai protesters die in custody.
[00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.736]  At least 78 people dead for protesting peaceably.
[00:01:46.756 --> 00:01:49.418]  You know, at least that makes us look good.
[00:01:49.438 --> 00:01:53.583]  We just shoot young women on the street and basically blow their brains out.
[00:01:54.507 --> 00:01:58.892]  But over there, we free, we have king and queen, we free.
[00:01:59.132 --> 00:02:04.398]  I know someone from Thailand who had an argument with about, she said, we free, we have king and queen.
[00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:07.161]  Very, very, very free over there.
[00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:08.703]  So we'll talk about that.
[00:02:08.743 --> 00:02:09.864]  One of our allies, of course.
[00:02:10.444 --> 00:02:12.727]  Australian probes report
[00:02:13.402 --> 00:02:34.950]  that uh... suspect polio virus released to the public i talked about i mentioned the article never covered it i will today increase in war funding sought bush request seventy billion more than what he first asked for and since you're going so well at georgia supreme court throws out hate crimes law there is something good to report for you today
[00:02:36.802 --> 00:02:40.206]  Also, UK Prime Minister announces plans for national ID card.
[00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:42.009]  Of course, they just do it here.
[00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:42.789]  They don't tell you.
[00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.998]  And betting on bagging Osama, journalist wager on exact day of bin Laden capture, Toronto Star.
[00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:52.020]  They're saying he's already in custody.
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.983]  My intel is he died and has been frozen.
[00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:56.486]  That's for two and a half years I've been telling you that.
[00:02:57.112 --> 00:02:58.572]  Also, no evidence of U.S.
[00:02:58.632 --> 00:03:00.193]  election terror plot report.
[00:03:00.253 --> 00:03:03.433]  Now they're out saying that again, while at the same time saying there is evidence of it.
[00:03:04.154 --> 00:03:05.174]  More Bin Laden stuff.
[00:03:05.194 --> 00:03:07.614]  Bin Laden is located, says 9-11 panelist.
[00:03:08.695 --> 00:03:12.315]  Also, British agents engineered capture of CARE International.
[00:03:12.355 --> 00:03:14.556]  Margaret Hassan.
[00:03:15.296 --> 00:03:24.598]  Again, yet another case of where we have these people being kidnapped by Iraqi security forces by globalists staging these events.
[00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:35.964]  And then, of course, also Richard Clark, former advisor to President Bush, confronted by Carol Breier, one of the 9-11 Truth Movement people, at a public meeting.
[00:03:36.044 --> 00:03:39.606]  And when she brought up stuff that's admitted, part of the record, he called her conspiracy theorist.
[00:03:41.047 --> 00:03:42.088]  So we'll be covering that.
[00:03:42.828 --> 00:03:46.910]  Also, Dover Air Force Base civilians face backdoor draft.
[00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.451]  This is out of Delaware News.
[00:03:49.392 --> 00:03:51.873]  Also, pilot and plane blamed for
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.883]  587 crash over Queens, New York.
[00:03:54.903 --> 00:03:56.947]  They're just now coming out with that out of the New York Post.
[00:03:56.987 --> 00:04:01.836]  That is just as asinine as saying that lightning caused TWA Flight 800.
[00:04:03.035 --> 00:04:09.081]  Also, protesters demand ban on less than lethal guns in the wake of the Snellgrove murder.
[00:04:09.721 --> 00:04:12.184]  And Boston's killer, cops, death of a fan.
[00:04:12.204 --> 00:04:14.446]  I want to go over this editorial about it.
[00:04:14.946 --> 00:04:18.490]  South Bend Tribune drill simulates bombing at UP Mall.
[00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.654]  And they simulated that with all the children, training them how to be good little slaves.
[00:04:22.674 --> 00:04:24.836]  Remember that plane crash last week?
[00:04:24.856 --> 00:04:28.199]  Depleted uranium released during Canadian plane crash.
[00:04:30.147 --> 00:04:34.428]  Also, Nokia developing RFID-embedded cell phones to track and trace you.
[00:04:34.868 --> 00:04:38.089]  Police accused of firing taser at pregnant bride.
[00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:46.850]  And new developments about how the implantable chip is dangerous for you to take physically, not just spiritually or economically.
[00:04:47.631 --> 00:04:53.932]  And that's the tip of the iceberg, and we have a big guest coming up as well in the second hour for this Tuesday edition.
[00:04:53.952 --> 00:04:58.233]  Don't forget the websites, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:58.533 --> 00:04:59.313]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.974]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.394 --> 00:05:13.637]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:13.857 --> 00:05:20.902]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.283 --> 00:05:27.407]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:28.748]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.068 --> 00:05:32.030]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.211]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:41.755]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:05:42.035 --> 00:05:45.437]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:05:45.857 --> 00:05:50.524]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time that's 866-885-6625 call today!
[00:06:00.942 --> 00:06:04.223]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:04.264 --> 00:06:08.465]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:08.705 --> 00:06:11.487]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:11.687 --> 00:06:14.088]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:14.288 --> 00:06:22.931]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:23.112 --> 00:06:24.452]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:06:24.652 --> 00:06:28.814]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:06:29.154 --> 00:06:29.915]  We're good to go!
[00:06:57.955 --> 00:06:59.576]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.436 --> 00:07:04.778]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:09.380]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.941]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:07:13.961 --> 00:07:15.302]  The New World Order.
[00:07:16.223 --> 00:07:16.823]  Animer.
[00:07:17.084 --> 00:07:21.308]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:21.368 --> 00:07:28.316]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:28.436 --> 00:07:30.459]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:30.799 --> 00:07:41.222]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:07:41.422 --> 00:07:46.823]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:07:47.304 --> 00:07:49.924]  Visit infowars.com or prisonplanet.com to order.
[00:07:49.944 --> 00:07:51.225]  You're called toll-free, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:51.245 --> 00:07:51.665]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:51.685 --> 00:07:53.485]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:08:02.327 --> 00:08:08.350]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:12.011]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.512 --> 00:08:15.573]  Ah, Hans Blix!
[00:08:15.633 --> 00:08:16.753]  How you doing, buddy?
[00:08:16.773 --> 00:08:18.834]  Oh yeah, really?
[00:08:18.854 --> 00:08:21.696]  Don't like my nuclear reactors?
[00:08:21.736 --> 00:08:23.917]  How about you move over a little bit, Hans Blix?
[00:08:23.957 --> 00:08:25.517]  Turn right there a little bit to the left.
[00:08:25.997 --> 00:08:26.558]  Ah, Hans Blix!
[00:08:26.618 --> 00:08:27.878]  How you like that, Hans Blix?
[00:08:27.898 --> 00:08:29.439]  Alright, I'm sorry.
[00:08:30.177 --> 00:08:39.684]  I'm talking about, it's a horribly dark satirical film, and I did see it for just to analyze it purposes, of course.
[00:08:40.625 --> 00:08:41.406]  What is it called?
[00:08:42.587 --> 00:08:43.908]  What's the name?
[00:08:43.988 --> 00:08:45.189]  Yeah, Team America!
[00:08:45.209 --> 00:08:49.632]  I mean, just total, total New World Order desensitization.
[00:08:50.232 --> 00:08:53.415]  And I was imitating the scene where Kim Jong-Il, the puppet,
[00:08:54.196 --> 00:08:56.738]  Uh, drops Hans Blix into a pit of sharks.
[00:08:57.339 --> 00:09:04.844]  And the reason I mention this movie is, uh, Sean Penn, uh, who literally, folks, is basically retarded.
[00:09:05.725 --> 00:09:10.508]  Uh, Sean Penn has written a letter to them, complaining and demanding he be taken out of it.
[00:09:10.528 --> 00:09:15.933]  Because they make fun of all the liberals, you know, the, uh, people in Hollywood that, uh, run around who are against the war.
[00:09:16.273 --> 00:09:18.675]  But it also makes fun, of course, of Bush and everybody else.
[00:09:19.195 --> 00:09:21.697]  It's an equal opportunity offender, making everybody angry.
[00:09:22.377 --> 00:09:26.561]  But didn't Sean Penn know that would just make the film explode even more?
[00:09:27.061 --> 00:09:27.902]  Don't people know that?
[00:09:28.262 --> 00:09:34.507]  You know, it's like patriots and conservative and libertarian leaders who get attacked by somebody and they whine and scream about it and talk about it.
[00:09:34.787 --> 00:09:36.128]  It only makes it worse.
[00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:42.594]  People just, across the political spectrum, never figure this out.
[00:09:42.774 --> 00:09:44.095]  And they really should.
[00:09:45.546 --> 00:09:55.630]  Well, that's quite a way to start the second segment, really the main start of the show, because a lot of stations don't carry that first little five-minute segment we did right when the hour starts, because they carry the news.
[00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:00.432]  But yes, quite a way to start the broadcast talking about Team America.
[00:10:01.672 --> 00:10:05.034]  And again, parental discretion advised, do not take your children to see this film.
[00:10:05.854 --> 00:10:08.375]  Folks, there is so much here to cover.
[00:10:08.535 --> 00:10:10.516]  We've got Raleigh James coming on the show.
[00:10:11.812 --> 00:10:17.095]  Conservative slash libertarian talk show host syndicated broadcast for 30-40 states.
[00:10:17.756 --> 00:10:23.580]  And I'm a regular guest on her broadcast, but the reason we're having her on is because she's so intelligent and informed on the issues.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.081]  And I first interviewed
[00:10:27.282 --> 00:10:46.933]  Well, I was first interviewed by her about a year ago, but I first started waking up to the New World Order here in Austin about ten years ago, listening to Tex Mars and others, but I also learned about Mina and the murders and the rest of it before there were films made about it, listening to Raleigh James here locally on the AM Dial.
[00:10:48.374 --> 00:10:53.917]  And she's a very interesting lady, so she shall be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:10:53.977 --> 00:10:55.378]  We look forward to that.
[00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:58.649]  And we already have callers calling in.
[00:10:58.669 --> 00:11:02.410]  We will take your calls in the shower, early in the shower.
[00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:04.811]  I'm able to plow through all the important news.
[00:11:05.371 --> 00:11:07.551]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:11:07.571 --> 00:11:07.691]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:11:07.711 --> 00:11:13.032]  Oh, by the way, on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.net and all the other great sites,
[00:11:23.257 --> 00:11:27.320]  We have the new Eminem video put out by Guerrilla News Network.
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.802]  Now, Guerrilla News Network is non-partisan.
[00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:35.806]  And they put me in one of their powerful 9-11 videos that they put out a year ago.
[00:11:35.826 --> 00:11:38.328]  And I've been in several of their productions.
[00:11:38.348 --> 00:11:39.409]  I've been honored to do so.
[00:11:39.489 --> 00:11:42.111]  Well, now they've been producing Eminem's videos.
[00:11:42.191 --> 00:11:48.836]  Now, I wondered a few years ago why Eminem was being demonized as this evil, profane person.
[00:11:49.648 --> 00:11:59.711]  When, on the Richter scale of being profane as a hip-hop rapper, he was about a 2, when a lot of these groups, the average I'd say is about a 10.
[00:12:01.231 --> 00:12:11.534]  I mean, I couldn't understand it, until I started listening to his music about, The Road Scholar, New World Order, taking us down, gonna crush our freedoms, you know, all this stuff.
[00:12:12.454 --> 00:12:13.975]  And then I found out that, well,
[00:12:15.015 --> 00:12:17.216]  Eminem likes to watch somebody's videos.
[00:12:17.776 --> 00:12:27.040]  That person is me and many, many others, but again, I have a lot of folks in the establishment media who have woken up to the new world order.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.801]  He wasn't doing this just two or three years ago.
[00:12:28.881 --> 00:12:29.461]  Now he is.
[00:12:29.761 --> 00:12:31.322]  That's when the attacks on him started.
[00:12:32.642 --> 00:12:43.187]  And now this new video he's put out, which you will not see on MTV or VH1 or here on the radio, says George Bush carried out 9-11 and is an incredible little mini-doc.
[00:12:43.812 --> 00:12:46.595]  And it shows actual news articles and stuff concerning it.
[00:12:47.315 --> 00:12:52.220]  And then it shows Bin Laden with the mountains behind him and suddenly that falls down.
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:58.365]  It's a TV set and behind him are Bush and Cheney.
[00:12:59.586 --> 00:13:08.134]  Then of course a few months ago the number one song on the radio was put out by another artist saying the government was behind 9-11 and dealt the drugs.
[00:13:08.514 --> 00:13:10.756]  Number one on the charts, another song.
[00:13:11.505 --> 00:13:19.016]  And they were actually fighting to keep it off of the radio stations, but people demanded it so they went ahead and played it some.
[00:13:19.457 --> 00:13:24.023]  So despite the fact that it didn't get a lot of airplay, it was the number one selling, that is.
[00:13:24.524 --> 00:13:26.467]  So, they're having a big problem.
[00:13:27.297 --> 00:13:44.240]  When they have a major poll in New York and half of New Yorkers believe the government was behind 9-11, 67% believe the government had prior knowledge of 9-11, and when I do interviews on liberal, conservative, libertarian, Christian stations, the host can be attacking me.
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:48.681]  But every caller, now on average it's every caller, agrees with me.
[00:13:49.521 --> 00:13:51.941]  Just a few months ago it was 1 out of 30 disagreed.
[00:13:51.981 --> 00:13:56.282]  Now I think I've done probably 15 interviews the last few weeks and I think
[00:13:57.265 --> 00:14:04.810]  I think this morning one guy called in and disagreed with me when I was in a local talk show here on the local KLBJFM for a couple of hours.
[00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.732]  And he was so incoherent he could hardly form sentences.
[00:14:10.353 --> 00:14:18.538]  And then somebody else emailed him and said, it's not true, you know, they don't have a plan for a national ID card when it's all over the news.
[00:14:18.758 --> 00:14:20.559]  So again, I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.832]  All we're talking about is the real stuff that's happening.
[00:14:23.852 --> 00:14:25.553]  So the globalists are really starting to panic.
[00:14:25.633 --> 00:14:32.659]  From hip-hop, to best-selling authors, to conservative, to liberal, across the board.
[00:14:33.219 --> 00:14:33.860]  Everybody.
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:39.984]  And I mean, because when half the people wake up to 9-11, it's short order until the other half wake up.
[00:14:40.145 --> 00:14:42.166]  Or 90% of the other half.
[00:14:42.406 --> 00:14:47.010]  Then you've got the other little 5% that are in total, abject, complete denial.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.281]  Major polls, 92% of Americans believe that the U.S.
[00:14:53.341 --> 00:14:54.981]  government killed Kennedy.
[00:14:55.741 --> 00:14:56.721]  How did I come up with that number?
[00:14:56.881 --> 00:15:05.963]  Well, earlier this year on the 40th anniversary, I guess last year now, I averaged together 12 different polls.
[00:15:06.043 --> 00:15:15.605]  I sat there for about an hour and a half going to TV polls, major newspaper polls, CNN polls, a local Austin poll, and I averaged them all together from the scientific polls
[00:15:16.408 --> 00:15:22.832]  Because they were 85, 97, and I averaged 12 polls together on my calculator and wrote a little article about it, and it came up 92%.
[00:15:23.313 --> 00:15:28.776]  That's actually the way the government samples polls and does real focus groups, because they don't press just one poll.
[00:15:29.277 --> 00:15:30.577]  They take a bunch of polls and do it.
[00:15:31.358 --> 00:15:34.300]  But it was 92% from 12 polls.
[00:15:35.281 --> 00:15:41.845]  So I guess the 8% of you, you know it all, and we're all raving kook lunatics, and you are completely normal.
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:53.929]  In fact, since I mentioned polls and the word conspiracy theorists, let me dig into this monumental stack I have here today and read this article from Global Free Press.
[00:15:55.711 --> 00:15:59.654]  It says, Carol Brea confronts Richard Clarke on 9-11 war drills.
[00:16:00.054 --> 00:16:02.937]  Clarke responded, you've been reading too many conspiracy theories.
[00:16:02.997 --> 00:16:05.779]  I think I've spent enough time responding to your questions.
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.481]  Questioning Richard Clark.
[00:16:07.501 --> 00:16:12.528]  This was last Sunday from a report of Carol Breier, 9-11 Truth Alliance.
[00:16:13.068 --> 00:16:22.300]  It says, on Saturday, October 23rd, Richard Clark, author of Against All Enemies, spoke at the Flint Center in Cupertino with Angie
[00:16:23.112 --> 00:16:25.353]  Cairo from KQED's forum.
[00:16:25.813 --> 00:16:37.277]  As Breier reported, he started with his usual talk, including how Democrats could fight the war on terrorism better than the current administration, including some hawkish talk about real threats like Iran and North Korea.
[00:16:37.817 --> 00:16:42.859]  At one point, 9-11 Truth activist, Phil Breier, had the opportunity to confront Clark with some questions.
[00:16:42.939 --> 00:16:43.179]  Quote,
[00:16:43.906 --> 00:16:56.514]  On 9-11 there were multiple exercises going off involving NORAD, the FAA, CIA, involving drills simulating a plane crashing into a building, a live flying hijack drill, inserting false blips, inserts on radar screens.
[00:16:57.935 --> 00:16:59.876]  Were you unaware of those drills?
[00:17:00.276 --> 00:17:02.397]  Who was coordinating them from the White House?
[00:17:02.498 --> 00:17:08.201]  Bush gave chaining authorization in May 2001 to coordinate counter-terrorism response over multiple agencies.
[00:17:08.221 --> 00:17:09.482]  You got took control from the generals.
[00:17:10.082 --> 00:17:10.643]  She went on, was
[00:17:12.228 --> 00:17:14.829]  He was in charge when he arrived at the White House.
[00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:17.790]  He said in May 8th order was for Cheney to oversee, not coordinate.
[00:17:33.829 --> 00:17:35.730]  Then they knew about the hijackings at A-20.
[00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:37.891]  Clark answered, Read the 9-11 Commission Report.
[00:17:38.071 --> 00:17:39.812]  Briere replied, It's a whitewash.
[00:17:39.873 --> 00:17:44.535]  What about the chemical warfare attack drill scheduled for New York City on September 12th?
[00:17:44.815 --> 00:17:45.676]  Were you aware of that?
[00:17:46.616 --> 00:17:49.218]  Clark responded, You've been reading too many conspiracy theories.
[00:17:49.598 --> 00:17:51.659]  I think I've spent enough time responding to your questions.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.682]  As usual, Briere took also the opportunity to pass out the session dollars.
[00:17:56.102 --> 00:17:59.744]  Okay, so... Why is this important?
[00:18:00.316 --> 00:18:09.265]  Because the spokesman for FEMA, Mr. Kenney, got up two days after 9-11 on CBS News and said, well it was lucky because we were going to have a drill the next day.
[00:18:09.285 --> 00:18:10.866]  It was actually September 11th.
[00:18:11.267 --> 00:18:13.709]  And so we were in place September 10th.
[00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:19.775]  And they'd already set up that morning down at the harbor about 500 yards away their new emergency command center.
[00:18:20.569 --> 00:18:24.011]  And then they said, that's not true, he misspoke, it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:18:24.291 --> 00:18:32.416]  Well then we got the actual documents, the government now admits it, Giuliani testified before the 9-11 Commission and talked about Tripod 2, and it's all admitted.
[00:18:32.476 --> 00:18:34.518]  I mean, he's calling that a conspiracy theory?
[00:18:34.738 --> 00:18:39.681]  He's calling drills on 9-11 that were in the Associated Press two years ago that?
[00:18:40.421 --> 00:18:43.263]  Six months, seven months ago on ABC Nightly News?
[00:18:43.603 --> 00:18:47.746]  In my film, Masters of Terror, released over two years ago?
[00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:49.672]  That's the thing about my videos.
[00:18:49.692 --> 00:18:57.303]  You get my videos made two years ago and they're more up-to-date than most of the other videos that are out there with all the hardcore pertinent, pertinent documented information.
[00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:02.186]  Well, you gotta get Road to Tyranny and Masters of Terror, my friends.
[00:19:02.667 --> 00:19:05.049]  But, uh, so again, everything's a conspiracy.
[00:19:05.189 --> 00:19:09.613]  You know, Alex, there's no National ID Card Plan, you're a liar, it's a conspiracy.
[00:19:10.074 --> 00:19:12.296]  Oh no, it's just all over the news and telling us how good it is.
[00:19:12.816 --> 00:19:19.883]  I mean, you've got a public who's in abject denial that that percentage that won't wake up, just no matter what we say or do, it just ain't true.
[00:19:20.963 --> 00:19:22.885]  You know, it just ain't that way, as they say.
[00:19:23.426 --> 00:19:24.487]  Uh, just any excuse.
[00:19:26.354 --> 00:19:29.815]  We'll get back, I'm going to News Blitz, and then we'll come back in the next segment after that.
[00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:31.275]  Start taking your calls at 800-259-9231.
[00:19:31.456 --> 00:19:37.157]  Thai protesters die in custody, 78 of them murdered by the police.
[00:19:37.817 --> 00:19:43.299]  Australian probs report that suspect polio virus, filled with cancer, released to the public.
[00:19:43.919 --> 00:19:49.441]  AFP, increase for the war, staged Bin Laden capture news.
[00:19:50.294 --> 00:19:51.615]  It is ultra-massive.
[00:19:51.655 --> 00:19:52.616]  It's all lined up.

[00:20:02.066 --> 00:20:03.367]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:20:03.607 --> 00:20:09.690]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:13.692]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:20:14.072 --> 00:20:15.953]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:20:15.993 --> 00:20:18.294]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:20:18.434 --> 00:20:24.377]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency.
[00:20:24.437 --> 00:20:24.938]  We're good to go.
[00:20:43.456 --> 00:20:44.637]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[00:21:04.361 --> 00:21:08.024]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[00:21:08.644 --> 00:21:12.527]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[00:21:13.227 --> 00:21:21.813]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[00:21:22.774 --> 00:21:29.939]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain, and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.

[00:24:08.747 --> 00:24:09.448]  Welcome back.
[00:24:09.468 --> 00:24:13.631]  BBC reports Thai protesters died in custody.
[00:24:13.851 --> 00:24:21.096]  At least 78 people dead in southern Thailand after being arrested and locked into army trucks following Monday's clashes with security forces.
[00:24:22.116 --> 00:24:26.840]  Officials said almost all the dead suffocated as they were taken to an army barrack several hours away.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:34.245]  The new death toll is in addition to six people who died during the clashes themselves, which erupted on Monday following an arrest of six Muslim men.
[00:24:35.225 --> 00:24:38.566]  It was the latest in an upsurge of violence in the Muslim-majority South.
[00:24:39.766 --> 00:24:43.087]  And the neocons are celebrating, yeah, load them in trucks, kill them.
[00:24:43.547 --> 00:24:49.509]  They loaded tens of thousands of people on trucks in Afghanistan, just innocent men, just the men of the country.
[00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:53.350]  And some of them obviously fighters, but many of them innocent.
[00:24:53.410 --> 00:25:00.752]  And then most of them died in the containers, held in there for four or five days, with literally not even standing room, just crammed in.
[00:25:00.772 --> 00:25:02.253]  It's like being crucified.
[00:25:02.293 --> 00:25:03.773]  You can't breathe, you can't sit down.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.961]  And then they took out those that were alive, lined them up and shot them and some U.S.
[00:25:08.001 --> 00:25:16.762]  and British reporters got that on tape, called in their satellite report, and then were suddenly in the Allied control zone, killed execution style.
[00:25:16.782 --> 00:25:17.503]  I wonder who did that.
[00:25:18.003 --> 00:25:29.205]  Violence erupted after at least 1,500 protesters gathered outside a police station in Narwat province after the detention of six Muslim men, and 1,000 protesters were arrested.
[00:25:30.137 --> 00:25:36.219]  And, uh, 78 of the arrested protesters were later found dead, apparently after they had suffocated in the trucks used to transport them.
[00:25:36.239 --> 00:25:38.360]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:38.960]  That's too bad.
[00:25:39.601 --> 00:25:51.725]  Australia probes report that suspect polio virus released to the public, AFP, out of Sydney, Australian authorities moved Saturday to reassure people vaccinated against polio.
[00:25:52.686 --> 00:25:56.387]  After a report that the contaminated vaccine linked to cancer was issued at the time,
[00:25:57.091 --> 00:26:10.442]  And the Australian Medical Chief and others admit in the AIDS reports that at least 3 million people were given doses of it after they knew that it had the cancer virus SV40 in it.
[00:26:11.103 --> 00:26:23.833]  Folks, I've been told by a respected Austin doctor that the clinics are still giving the welfare children the oral polio vaccine made in the 60s full of SV40, which is illegal to give in this country but nobody enforces it.
[00:26:24.412 --> 00:26:26.274]  I mean, it's illegal in the U.S.
[00:26:26.314 --> 00:26:28.055]  to tell people they have to take vaccines.
[00:26:28.536 --> 00:26:31.338]  We even had to get a law passed in Texas pointing out that law.
[00:26:31.838 --> 00:26:34.521]  And they still get on the news and say, it's the law, you gotta take the vaccines.
[00:26:34.561 --> 00:26:35.782]  You know you've all seen it and heard it.
[00:26:35.802 --> 00:26:38.144]  I mean, it's just, there's no end to this.
[00:26:40.125 --> 00:26:44.369]  It says 90% of Australian children ages 5 to 14 have been injected with the vaccine.
[00:26:44.389 --> 00:26:48.072]  The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories was privatized in 94.
[00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:55.833]  And it's created a massive increase in all these different types of vaccines.
[00:26:57.113 --> 00:27:00.775]  And it says the issue was revealed at an international workshop on SV40 in the U.S.
[00:27:00.815 --> 00:27:01.795]  in January of 1997.
[00:27:02.556 --> 00:27:03.516]  That was in Chicago.
[00:27:04.257 --> 00:27:12.620]  The meeting concluded that there is no evidence of increased cancer risk in people who were given vaccine containing SV40, but it does cause cancer.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:13.861]  That's not true, folks.
[00:27:14.281 --> 00:27:15.702]  I've read these studies.
[00:27:15.782 --> 00:27:16.322]  Well, I'll tell you.
[00:27:17.185 --> 00:27:19.706]  I mean, cancer is up 400% in this country.
[00:27:20.726 --> 00:27:26.708]  And it's directly linked to vaccines and of course also some environmental concerns, things that are in the environment.
[00:27:28.068 --> 00:27:31.189]  Increase in war funding sought to sell the Washington Post.
[00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:34.650]  Bush to request $70 billion more.
[00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:37.511]  Which will go mainly into a bid contract with his friends.
[00:27:37.831 --> 00:27:42.732]  The Bush administration intends, and Kerry has no plans to stop it by the way, no matter who gets elected next week.
[00:27:43.232 --> 00:27:46.273]  The Bush administration intends to seek $70 billion in emergency funds.
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:28:07.868]  For the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, early next year, pushing total war cost close to $225 billion since the invasion of Iraq last year, Pentagon and Congressional officials said yesterday, White House Budget Office spokesman Chad Colton emphasized that the final decisions on the supplemental spending request will not be made until shortly before the request is sent to Congress.
[00:28:08.728 --> 00:28:15.571]  That may not happen until early February when President Bush submits his budget for fiscal year 2006, assuming he wins re-election.
[00:28:16.051 --> 00:28:25.997]  The Pentagon and House Appropriations Committee, aides of the Defense Department and Military Services are scrambling to get their final request to the White House Office of Budget Management by mid-November, shortly before the election.
[00:28:26.637 --> 00:28:37.063]  After the election, the new numbers underscored that the war is going to be far more costly and intense and last longer than the administration first suggested.
[00:28:38.824 --> 00:28:42.886]  And the Army is expected to request an additional $30 billion on top of that
[00:28:43.992 --> 00:28:45.893]  Just to get through to the new year.
[00:28:48.774 --> 00:28:50.054]  It's big business, folks.
[00:28:50.074 --> 00:28:51.395]  That's why they don't want to win the war.
[00:28:51.435 --> 00:28:52.795]  They want it to drag on forever.
[00:28:53.436 --> 00:28:55.837]  Some good news for everybody.
[00:28:55.857 --> 00:29:07.181]  A couple weeks ago, Federal Appeals Court, what, 11th Circuit in Atlanta, a conservative court, said that the Bill of Rights cannot be scrapped and freedom destroyed.
[00:29:08.237 --> 00:29:21.961]  Because of the war on terror, and that protesters being arrested for no reason, and being screened with metal detectors to get into towns themselves, is a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:29:22.601 --> 00:29:24.122]  Well, now some more good news.
[00:29:24.242 --> 00:29:26.962]  Georgia's Supreme Court throws out hate crimes law.
[00:29:27.243 --> 00:29:28.643]  It's really a thought crimes law.
[00:29:30.604 --> 00:29:33.484]  Watch the so-called conservative Supreme Court, though, strike that down.
[00:29:33.664 --> 00:29:35.525]  Seven of the nine appointed by Republicans.
[00:29:36.637 --> 00:29:38.538]  UK Prime Minister announces plans for ID cards.
[00:29:38.558 --> 00:29:39.919]  A lot more coming up.
[00:29:39.939 --> 00:29:40.880]  Your calls first.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.021]  And then a big guest as well.
[00:29:44.082 --> 00:29:45.162]  It is Tuesday.
[00:29:45.482 --> 00:29:49.004]  Less than seven days out from the big 2004 election.
[00:29:49.044 --> 00:29:49.765]  Coverage coming up.
[00:29:51.606 --> 00:29:52.527]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.987 --> 00:29:54.628]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.508 --> 00:29:58.190]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.178 --> 00:30:02.879]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:30:02.959 --> 00:30:05.460]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.341]  It feels great.
[00:30:06.521 --> 00:30:07.521]  Absolutely wonderful.
[00:30:07.641 --> 00:30:13.184]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:30:13.484 --> 00:30:15.005]  Kimberly, tell us about your success.
[00:30:15.265 --> 00:30:17.646]  Okay, I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[00:30:17.786 --> 00:30:20.988]  I've lost 16 pounds, and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[00:30:21.088 --> 00:30:21.768]  Incredible!
[00:30:21.948 --> 00:30:23.189]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[00:30:23.209 --> 00:30:26.871]  I have a 21-month-old child, and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[00:30:26.991 --> 00:30:27.791]  Well that's for sure.
[00:30:27.952 --> 00:30:28.532]  Was it easy?
[00:30:28.752 --> 00:30:29.372]  Very easy.
[00:30:29.412 --> 00:30:30.293]  I mean there's nothing to it.
[00:30:30.313 --> 00:30:35.495]  You can actually still continue to eat meals with your children and not starve yourself or anything else and lose weight.
[00:30:35.736 --> 00:30:41.959]  I know you can lose fat the safe and healthy way just like Kimberly did with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:30:42.339 --> 00:30:43.160]  Call right now.
[00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:43.901]  1-800-622-THIN.
[00:30:44.562 --> 00:30:46.144]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:30:48.807 --> 00:30:53.693]  Remember, mention you heard it right here, and that gets you $25 off a three-month supply.
[00:30:53.934 --> 00:30:55.135]  So call Vim and Vigor today.

[00:30:55.395 --> 00:30:55.856]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:31:01.195 --> 00:31:06.158]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[00:31:06.479 --> 00:31:08.720]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating.
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.902]  Our Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[00:31:11.942 --> 00:31:16.245]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[00:31:16.585 --> 00:31:19.607]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[00:31:19.928 --> 00:31:23.350]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:33.014]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:31:33.274 --> 00:31:36.775]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:31:37.015 --> 00:31:44.118]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[00:32:01.149 --> 00:32:02.630]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:32:02.831 --> 00:32:10.177]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:32:10.497 --> 00:32:14.901]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:32:15.181 --> 00:32:25.010]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[00:32:25.771 --> 00:32:29.435]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[00:32:29.775 --> 00:32:32.298]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[00:32:32.558 --> 00:32:38.485]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[00:32:38.725 --> 00:32:40.287]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[00:32:40.547 --> 00:32:41.428]  Friends, don't wait.
[00:32:41.528 --> 00:32:44.509]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[00:32:44.669 --> 00:32:46.930]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:50.492]  That's 800-255-1912.
[00:32:51.292 --> 00:32:55.354]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[00:32:55.494 --> 00:32:56.395]  It's powerful stuff.
[00:33:22.045 --> 00:33:26.789]  Alright, Jim and Eric and John and John and everybody else, your calls are coming up here momentarily.
[00:33:26.809 --> 00:33:27.890]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:43.443]  But Tom Andrew is a contributor to the Roundtable, and of course the Midas Report, some of the great broadcasts that come out of the Minnesota offices of the GCN Radio Network, and he popped in my ear and said, have you heard about Cuba?
[00:33:44.083 --> 00:33:45.304]  And I said, yes I have.
[00:33:45.384 --> 00:33:47.846]  Cuba to end circulation of U.S.
[00:33:47.886 --> 00:33:48.287]  dollar.
[00:33:49.153 --> 00:33:51.863]  And I said, why don't you pop on for just a minute or two and talk about that.
[00:33:52.506 --> 00:33:54.052]  Why this is so important.
[00:33:55.817 --> 00:34:03.780]  Is because Russia, China, Europe, the Middle East, Japan, they're now starting to move away from the dollar.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.600]  They're not buying our treasury notes.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.902]  They're not buying our short and long-term bonds like they used to, basically exclusively.
[00:34:11.262 --> 00:34:17.044]  They're shifting large portions of their investment into the European Union system, which is owned by the same globalists.
[00:34:17.064 --> 00:34:22.506]  But the point is, Bush has openly said two years ago, when the slide of the dollar started, and it's now down 40%
[00:34:24.421 --> 00:34:24.641]  I think?
[00:34:39.817 --> 00:34:47.920]  That means that if you've got $10,000 in the bank as your nest egg or college fund, it's now worth about $6,000 overseas.
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:52.762]  And then those goods coming in, of course, you don't have as great a buying power.
[00:34:52.782 --> 00:34:57.203]  People in Mexico know their peso is worthless, but Americans are so dumbed down.
[00:34:57.624 --> 00:34:59.564]  I talk to business people about a weak dollar.
[00:34:59.864 --> 00:35:01.125]  They go, what's that mean?
[00:35:01.785 --> 00:35:03.586]  And then Bush said how great a weak dollar was.
[00:35:04.406 --> 00:35:07.027]  Well, now Cuba, which isn't a very big economic system,
[00:35:08.151 --> 00:35:14.635]  But still it will affect things and it could move into the rest of Latin America as Cuba is kind of a leader in Latin America doing this.
[00:35:15.355 --> 00:35:17.036]  And Cuba to end circulation of the U.S.
[00:35:17.056 --> 00:35:17.376]  dollar.
[00:35:17.396 --> 00:35:20.858]  Havana, Cuba announced on Monday that it was ending circulation of the U.S.
[00:35:20.898 --> 00:35:25.121]  dollar in its territory as of November 8th in response to tightening U.S.
[00:35:25.161 --> 00:35:26.141]  economic sanctions.
[00:35:26.802 --> 00:35:32.465]  Cubans, foreign residents and tourists will have to use locally printed convertible pesos
[00:35:33.294 --> 00:35:40.139]  About like a ruble, equal to the value of the dollar the central bank decree read on television said.
[00:35:41.346 --> 00:35:46.490]  As of November right, the dollar will not be accepted in our shops, which will only accept convertible pesos.
[00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:51.433]  A 10% commission will be charged for changing dollars into the local currency.
[00:35:51.753 --> 00:36:03.842]  The decree said the government encouraged Cubans living abroad to send cash remittance to their relatives in Cuba, other currencies such as the euro, the British pound, Swiss francs, Canadian dollars to avoid exchange costs.
[00:36:04.611 --> 00:36:09.452]  So, this domino continues, and Tom Andrew, you wanted to comment on this?
[00:36:09.972 --> 00:36:24.715]  Well, my only point being, Alex, is that, yeah, in Cuba, if you're holding dollars, you're paying an immediate 10% penalty, but what your listeners need to know, living in this country, you're kind of paying that same penalty, and Greenspan and company will always put a positive spin on it.
[00:36:24.755 --> 00:36:30.596]  They say, well, a weaker dollar will help our exports sell more briskly overseas.
[00:36:30.656 --> 00:36:32.657]  Well, Alex, I don't have exports.
[00:36:32.697 --> 00:36:33.577]  Do you have exports?
[00:36:35.718 --> 00:36:36.078]  No, I don't.
[00:36:36.178 --> 00:36:39.539]  I don't personally have exports, so how does that help me?
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:43.000]  Every fiat currency has had the same conclusion.
[00:36:44.261 --> 00:36:48.282]  Well, to be accurate, I do sell some books and videos overseas.
[00:36:48.902 --> 00:36:50.283]  And you're in the beef industry, right?
[00:36:51.043 --> 00:37:00.286]  No, but I do export, but people actually have to transfer that into dollars to do it, so it doesn't really affect me.
[00:37:02.668 --> 00:37:11.791]  The silver lining Bush talked about, about stuff being cheaper to foreigners is actually true, and it has increased some sales of a few things that are made in America.
[00:37:12.111 --> 00:37:12.351]  Right.
[00:37:12.411 --> 00:37:13.752]  You see the bigger picture of this.
[00:37:13.772 --> 00:37:15.052]  You talk about it all the time.
[00:37:15.132 --> 00:37:17.153]  It is a consolidation.
[00:37:18.173 --> 00:37:22.055]  Castro has always been defiant, and we kind of talked about that off air.
[00:37:23.735 --> 00:37:29.257]  I'm not going to make any predictions, but eventually doesn't Castro and his company have to kind of come down?
[00:37:31.235 --> 00:37:33.876]  Well, Castro really came down last week.
[00:37:34.836 --> 00:37:37.197]  In the real world, Fellon broke his knee and elbow.
[00:37:39.558 --> 00:37:41.018]  So perhaps that is an omen.
[00:37:41.898 --> 00:37:44.519]  But look, they put Castro in.
[00:37:44.919 --> 00:37:45.840]  You turned against him.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:49.081]  They've never been able to remove him, whether that's staged or real.
[00:37:49.821 --> 00:37:53.222]  And I think the days of Fidel Castro are obviously extremely numbered.
[00:37:53.931 --> 00:37:57.192]  Well, Alex, I appreciate you letting me have a little time and I'll let you get back to it.
[00:37:57.492 --> 00:37:58.673]  Alright, good talking to you.
[00:37:58.693 --> 00:38:04.495]  You can hear Tom when he sits in with analysis on some of the great broadcasts here on the network.
[00:38:04.995 --> 00:38:07.196]  Jim, in Texas, you're on the air, Jim.
[00:38:07.216 --> 00:38:07.796]  Thanks for holding.
[00:38:07.836 --> 00:38:08.236]  Go ahead.
[00:38:08.256 --> 00:38:09.517]  How are you?
[00:38:09.837 --> 00:38:10.097]  Good.
[00:38:10.937 --> 00:38:13.118]  We haven't talked in, what, two and a half years?
[00:38:14.218 --> 00:38:15.419]  I remember, yes.
[00:38:15.799 --> 00:38:17.420]  It's the Texas Scorpion.
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:21.061]  You've got that chance.
[00:38:23.513 --> 00:38:24.093]  You know Pat?
[00:38:24.513 --> 00:38:24.933]  Oh yes I do.
[00:38:24.953 --> 00:38:29.495]  There's a new book out and I've just finished it and it is a bang.
[00:38:30.855 --> 00:38:34.436]  And I need to get one to you for what I send it to.
[00:38:34.716 --> 00:38:37.377]  Is that his book about the Gordon Call situation?
[00:38:38.997 --> 00:38:39.558]  Uh, he is.
[00:38:39.958 --> 00:38:43.259]  No, uh, he's writing one about that or somebody is.
[00:38:43.459 --> 00:38:45.039]  Somebody give me the name of it.
[00:38:45.099 --> 00:38:48.040]  The name of it is maybe the people have the answers.
[00:38:49.341 --> 00:38:53.622]  And he affirmatively proves the 16th Amendment was void.
[00:38:55.062 --> 00:38:57.343]  Well, the income tax was not ratified.
[00:38:57.383 --> 00:39:05.644]  That was proven decades ago when the grandfather of the Fully Informed Jury Association, Red Beckman... You're talking about Red Beckman.
[00:39:06.004 --> 00:39:11.325]  Yeah, Red Beckman and others traveled the nation, went to the Secretary of State's offices, and it was not ratified.
[00:39:11.345 --> 00:39:15.466]  And you see, this is the type of scam they can run during a constitutional convention.
[00:39:16.582 --> 00:39:22.304]  Well, he's cutting all this into a draft form about Mr. Simpkannon's trial.
[00:39:22.964 --> 00:39:24.704]  You know who he is, Dick Simpkannon?
[00:39:24.764 --> 00:39:27.365]  Yes, Aero Custom Plastics, Fort Worth, Texas.
[00:39:28.065 --> 00:39:37.547]  And he has this story of the fellow out in Washington, and apparently they cross know each other.
[00:39:37.647 --> 00:39:43.069]  The one, Gary Phillips, Colonel Gary Phillips that worked for the INS, the one he went into
[00:39:44.449 --> 00:39:44.689]  Yes.
[00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:45.390]  I do too.
[00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:45.711]  Yes, I do.
[00:39:45.731 --> 00:39:46.451]  Well, I would love that.
[00:39:46.471 --> 00:39:49.695]  That would be really nice of you, Jim.
[00:39:49.715 --> 00:39:50.576]  You could send that to 3001.
[00:39:50.616 --> 00:39:51.117]  Let me get this.
[00:39:51.217 --> 00:39:53.980]  I need something to write on.
[00:40:05.968 --> 00:40:08.690]  Alex, excuse me, my health hasn't been too well.
[00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:10.331]  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Jim.
[00:40:10.651 --> 00:40:16.354]  Jim's an old-time Texas activist, gotten a lot of good stuff done, spreading the word about the New World Order.
[00:40:19.616 --> 00:40:21.597]  Okay, let me have your number.
[00:40:21.957 --> 00:40:22.598]  Sure, Jim.
[00:40:22.678 --> 00:40:27.541]  It's 3001, and it's South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, and it's Suite 100.
[00:40:33.186 --> 00:40:34.687]  And it's Austin, Texas.
[00:40:34.707 --> 00:40:37.589]  300 in South Lamar.
[00:40:37.609 --> 00:40:37.589]  3001.
[00:40:37.629 --> 00:40:41.031]  3001 in South Lamar, L.A.
[00:40:41.652 --> 00:40:42.072]  M.A.R.
[00:40:44.353 --> 00:40:45.134]  OK.
[00:40:45.314 --> 00:40:45.714]  Suite 100.
[00:40:47.736 --> 00:40:50.017]  Austin, Texas.
[00:40:50.037 --> 00:40:50.017]  78704.
[00:40:50.858 --> 00:40:54.460]  And there's no reason for you to spend your money.
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:57.322]  I mean, if Pat wants to come on the show, he's welcome to mail me one.
[00:40:57.342 --> 00:40:58.343]  I'll have him on the broadcast.
[00:40:58.403 --> 00:40:59.563]  Bob, come here.
[00:40:59.904 --> 00:41:00.864]  Here, he's staying busy.
[00:41:00.904 --> 00:41:01.965]  Now, what's your zip again?
[00:41:02.754 --> 00:41:04.695]  It's 78704, Jim.
[00:41:04.715 --> 00:41:05.756]  7-8-7-0-4.
[00:41:05.776 --> 00:41:06.216]  0-4.
[00:41:08.277 --> 00:41:13.220]  Hey, good hearing from you, my friend.
[00:41:13.761 --> 00:41:14.301]  Take care.
[00:41:14.921 --> 00:41:16.963]  Let's talk to Eric in Connecticut.
[00:41:17.023 --> 00:41:17.843]  Eric, you're on the air.
[00:41:17.903 --> 00:41:18.223]  Welcome.
[00:41:18.804 --> 00:41:19.184]  Hey, Alex.
[00:41:19.224 --> 00:41:21.265]  Good to talk to you again from Skull and Bones country.
[00:41:21.445 --> 00:41:24.727]  Yes, you are certainly there near the New Haven, Connecticut tomb.
[00:41:25.128 --> 00:41:25.668]  Absolutely.
[00:41:27.052 --> 00:41:27.752]  A couple of points.
[00:41:27.932 --> 00:41:33.977]  The first one is I was watching TV the other night and there was an advertisement for this movie called National Treasure.
[00:41:34.418 --> 00:41:35.519]  I'm not sure if you've heard of it.
[00:41:36.499 --> 00:41:46.168]  And it has to do with some treasure that was taken over by Columbus and buried and they had all kinds of Illuminati allusions and symbolism and it was kind of interesting.
[00:41:47.329 --> 00:41:49.771]  And I don't know, I suppose it's coming out next month.
[00:41:50.551 --> 00:41:53.674]  Yeah, about five months ago we saw the trailer for it
[00:41:54.927 --> 00:41:56.889]  One of the pre-promotion trailers.
[00:41:56.949 --> 00:41:59.751]  It's called National Treasure with Nicolas Cage.
[00:42:00.412 --> 00:42:06.657]  It is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer of Black Hawk Down and Pirates of the Caribbean.
[00:42:06.977 --> 00:42:13.842]  Bruckheimer consulted on how to have the stage rescue of Jessica Lynch that she said was a fable and never happened.
[00:42:14.603 --> 00:42:17.165]  He admitted to the BBC that he actually scripted all of that.
[00:42:18.226 --> 00:42:19.547]  And he's definitely a globalist.
[00:42:20.522 --> 00:42:24.925]  And now Jerry Bruckheimer has made this new film where the Masons are going to save us.
[00:42:24.945 --> 00:42:26.266]  They're all the founding fathers.
[00:42:26.766 --> 00:42:30.229]  The Illuminati is really about a secret treasure and an evil group trying to stop them.
[00:42:30.669 --> 00:42:33.311]  And the Illuminati is going to save you because they're so good.
[00:42:33.931 --> 00:42:37.473]  And now when we talk about the Illuminati, they'll go, oh, you got that from that movie.
[00:42:37.914 --> 00:42:43.918]  Just like when I was talking about skulls eight years ago, Skull and Bones, the movie Skulls comes out, whitewashing it.
[00:42:43.978 --> 00:42:45.479]  No, you got that from the movie.
[00:42:45.939 --> 00:42:51.483]  Yeah, and I didn't realize it was the same movie, because I'd heard about another Illuminati film, but I guess it was the same one.
[00:42:51.923 --> 00:42:52.704]  Oh, there's so many!
[00:42:52.764 --> 00:42:58.188]  I mean, they've had two Tomb Raiders now, where she's the daughter of the Illuminati, and she fights for the Illuminati!
[00:42:58.208 --> 00:43:00.529]  The Illuminati will save you!
[00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:03.071]  Absolutely, that's what they want us all to believe.
[00:43:03.131 --> 00:43:04.092]  It's like your movie, Alex.
[00:43:04.212 --> 00:43:15.440]  I hear them all banging on Fahrenheit 9-1-1, you know, in these other films, but I don't hear them talking about your movie, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, which, as far as I'm concerned, is the preeminent film
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.822]  On the government's inside job of 9-11, and you also go into a lot more.
[00:43:19.942 --> 00:43:21.463]  Well, thank you for those kind comments.
[00:43:21.503 --> 00:43:38.034]  The reason my film really is preeminent, 9-11 and the Road to Tyranny, is because we go over the history of government-sponsored terror, then Oklahoma City, then the first World Trade Center bombing, then 9-11, and then the last 45 minutes of the almost three-hour film gets into the whole police state and the New World Order.
[00:43:38.494 --> 00:43:38.674]  Yep.
[00:43:38.934 --> 00:43:42.917]  And Alex, I also wanted to mention there's something happening in the news today
[00:43:43.362 --> 00:43:45.483]  I'm sure you're aware of it, the Flight 587 Whitewash.
[00:43:45.543 --> 00:43:48.203]  Yeah, we're going to talk about that.
[00:43:48.323 --> 00:43:49.564]  Okay, it's interesting.
[00:43:49.644 --> 00:43:54.625]  I'm listening to the radio last night, and as I've mentioned before, I am a mechanical engineer.
[00:43:54.745 --> 00:44:03.728]  I've got quite an engineering background, and for somebody to design an Airbus that will fold up like a $2 camera in the middle of the flight doesn't make sense.
[00:44:03.828 --> 00:44:07.749]  I heard rumors that there was a pilot that was piloting that plane involved in 9-11 somehow.
[00:44:09.563 --> 00:44:17.658]  And basically shoe bomber number one was on that plane because of initial reports, eyewitness reports, and I have it on video.
[00:44:18.926 --> 00:44:22.107]  People had seen explosions coming out the side of that plane.
[00:44:22.187 --> 00:44:23.848]  Do me a favor, will you mail me that?
[00:44:24.048 --> 00:44:25.749]  Just an SP copy of that?
[00:44:26.109 --> 00:44:26.309]  Sure.
[00:44:26.709 --> 00:44:31.011]  Standard play, because it's basically worthless if it's not standard play.
[00:44:31.031 --> 00:44:33.011]  I mean, we'll take it if that's all you got.
[00:44:33.211 --> 00:44:34.052]  Yes, I do have that.
[00:44:34.432 --> 00:44:35.552]  I'd be happy to do that.
[00:44:35.872 --> 00:44:41.955]  Well, that would be a great favor, but for those that just joined us, I do have the Associated Press and New York Daily News reports.
[00:44:42.475 --> 00:44:45.576]  A few weeks after 9-11, this flight
[00:44:46.227 --> 00:45:02.094]  Blows up sheriff, deputies, firefighters, credible sources, and general citizens saw one of the front engines, the back tail, blow up explosions when the plane was only at about 1,500 feet.
[00:45:03.987 --> 00:45:14.512]  And it had been in maintenance that day and it said the FBI didn't even question the mainly Muslim repair crew that was doing maintenance on it.
[00:45:15.032 --> 00:45:17.573]  And so it rolls out, engines blow off.
[00:45:18.414 --> 00:45:19.894]  I mean, it's like TWA Flight 800.
[00:45:20.234 --> 00:45:22.335]  You had Army drills and Navy drills that night.
[00:45:23.516 --> 00:45:28.758]  Over 400 military men and women, many of them Vietnam vets, said they saw two missile trails.
[00:45:28.838 --> 00:45:30.719]  Police, firemen saw it.
[00:45:30.819 --> 00:45:31.559]  Everybody saw it.
[00:45:31.599 --> 00:45:32.860]  Over 800 witnesses total.
[00:45:33.627 --> 00:45:34.368]  Was that Jim Sanders?
[00:45:34.488 --> 00:45:36.650]  I believe he was the one that shot that, yes.
[00:45:51.667 --> 00:46:02.929]  So, I mean, again, folks, when they don't want you to know it's terrorism, it isn't terrorism, and then stuff that isn't terrorism they claim is terrorism, and then they stage the big events.
[00:46:03.969 --> 00:46:07.230]  So, again, we don't know exactly what happened with this flight.
[00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:08.710]  We just know they blew it up.
[00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:11.691]  Oh, and the official story, again, Alex, is a total lie.
[00:46:11.731 --> 00:46:13.791]  Those airbuses are built like truck.
[00:46:14.571 --> 00:46:17.732]  I mean, those things fly through hurricanes, they fly through thunderstorms,
[00:46:18.266 --> 00:46:23.169]  And for them to come out and say that the pilot hit a little bit too much on the rudder is complete hogwash.
[00:46:23.409 --> 00:46:24.130]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:25.751]  Hey, I appreciate the call.
[00:46:26.011 --> 00:46:38.319]  And we actually had one retired aircraft engineer, retired from one of the biggest companies out there, on when that happened, and he said it is a complete fraud.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:40.661]  By the way, it was a newer aircraft.
[00:46:40.921 --> 00:46:47.966]  I mean, you could see some really old aircraft, maybe an engine falling off occasionally, but two engines blowing up, people seeing explosions.
[00:46:48.641 --> 00:46:50.562]  And now they have explosions up in the air?
[00:46:50.963 --> 00:46:53.825]  It's like Flight 93 over Pennsylvania.
[00:46:54.245 --> 00:46:56.406]  Witnesses saw jets chasing and an explosion.
[00:46:56.706 --> 00:47:03.831]  It had an 8-mile debris field with one of the engines looking like a mushroom had been blown inside out, which is exactly what a missile does.
[00:47:05.332 --> 00:47:09.875]  I mean, here's the engine on the ground, blown inside out, and it's an 8-mile debris field.
[00:47:09.995 --> 00:47:12.317]  I just... Oh my goodness.
[00:47:13.147 --> 00:47:16.089]  It's getting really unbelievable now, isn't it?
[00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:18.851]  John in Michigan, good to hear from you, John.
[00:47:18.871 --> 00:47:20.432]  Hello?
[00:47:20.712 --> 00:47:21.093]  Hello!
[00:47:21.593 --> 00:47:22.614]  Sorry, John in Missouri.
[00:47:23.094 --> 00:47:25.876]  Okay, welcome in Missouri, just a little south of Michigan.
[00:47:26.196 --> 00:47:26.596]  Yes, sir.
[00:47:26.616 --> 00:47:28.057]  How are you doing today, Alex?
[00:47:28.177 --> 00:47:29.038]  I'm doing pretty good.
[00:47:29.878 --> 00:47:35.602]  I emailed Paul some stuff a couple weeks ago, if you don't mind me saying this other rapper's name.
[00:47:35.622 --> 00:47:39.405]  He talks about a lot more stuff than Eminem ever would.
[00:47:40.134 --> 00:47:40.634]  Who is it?
[00:47:40.714 --> 00:47:41.134]  Paris?
[00:47:41.534 --> 00:47:42.354]  New York rapper.
[00:47:42.434 --> 00:47:43.155]  Non-fiction.
[00:47:43.835 --> 00:47:46.675]  Guy talks about Illuminati symbolism.
[00:47:46.755 --> 00:47:48.155]  Talks about genetic food.
[00:47:48.876 --> 00:47:52.656]  Talks about welcome to Futurama where the sidewalks will shoot your mama.
[00:47:54.537 --> 00:47:59.097]  Talks about putting poison in baby's milk.
[00:48:00.198 --> 00:48:05.699]  I mean if... I think his rap could explain it better and I could always get choked up when I hear it.
[00:48:05.719 --> 00:48:06.739]  Have you heard Paris?
[00:48:09.435 --> 00:48:10.055]  Pardon?
[00:48:10.155 --> 00:48:11.336]  I'm sorry, I don't listen to that.
[00:48:12.036 --> 00:48:21.698]  I kind of got stirred up when you were talking about Eminem just because I'm one of your faithful listeners and I'd say people with Eminem is the Michael Moore of the rap community.
[00:48:21.878 --> 00:48:28.180]  People like Jump Steady and Nonfiction, they're the Jack Bloods and Alex Jones of the rap community.
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:34.541]  The kind of music you're going to have to look and dig for and chances are you'll have to download it because you can't find it at your local stores.
[00:48:35.201 --> 00:48:37.442]  You know, I mean it really gets into stuff.
[00:48:38.605 --> 00:48:40.306]  Well, that's great.
[00:48:40.867 --> 00:48:55.677]  No, I mean, I think it's wonderful now that more and more of the hip-hop people are getting out of, that's my Cadillac, and that's my gold rings, and that's my woman, and a lot of them are getting away from that, getting in to real political information.
[00:48:55.697 --> 00:48:58.558]  Yeah, that's what I think Public Enemy says it best.
[00:48:58.578 --> 00:49:01.480]  You got hip-hop and rap, and rap always had something to say.
[00:49:01.901 --> 00:49:02.801]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[00:49:03.802 --> 00:49:05.283]  I appreciate your call, John, in Missouri.
[00:49:06.129 --> 00:49:08.690]  Yeah, and again, I'm not a fan of hip-hop, I'm not a fan of rap.
[00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:11.831]  I mean, I like... Some of it I hear, I think, is enjoyable.
[00:49:12.171 --> 00:49:18.072]  A lot of it is, you know, unintelligible two hours of bragging about how powerful and how much money they have.
[00:49:18.472 --> 00:49:28.335]  And again, that's why MTV pushes that brand of it, to make the kids... Madison Avenue, to make the kids feel inadequate if they don't have a Cadillac, instead of having morals and being involved and having a family.
[00:49:29.035 --> 00:49:34.277]  And they have the same brands of that trash as invaded country music, as invaded and taken over rock and roll,
[00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:36.570]  You know, it's do as thou wilt.
[00:49:37.151 --> 00:49:38.991]  You know, only worry about number one.
[00:49:39.751 --> 00:49:45.713]  But more and more, the number one songs are getting completely away from that because that's what the people want.
[00:49:46.253 --> 00:49:48.954]  And you know, hip-hop and rap are number one now in this country.
[00:49:49.414 --> 00:49:50.815]  So it's a real societal...
[00:49:52.362 --> 00:50:05.609]  A phenomenon that we can't ignore and there in that societal phenomenon, most of the top songs that you never even hear on the radio, but they're still the top selling songs, are songs going, you know, the New World Order carried out 9-11 and breaking it all down.
[00:50:05.649 --> 00:50:11.492]  Yeah, I mean, that's a lot better than my Cadillac and my women and my mansion and my racehorses.
[00:50:12.072 --> 00:50:17.438]  You know, now it's, again, it shows the taste of the people really, really changing.
[00:50:17.458 --> 00:50:27.550]  And that's got to worry the globalists, when the most popular culture out there that they fought to suppress, you know, they fought to put out the gangster rap and the cop killer rap,
[00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:31.912]  And now that's all being ignored and being shoved to the side, literally.
[00:50:32.572 --> 00:50:38.375]  And I have family that are DJs, and what's taking it over is now the political information.
[00:50:38.415 --> 00:50:40.356]  And it's not, vote for John Kerry.
[00:50:40.396 --> 00:50:42.657]  It's, you got the choice, skull or bone.
[00:50:42.677 --> 00:50:44.698]  You know, it's shifting into the paradigm.
[00:50:45.298 --> 00:50:49.901]  And so that's a real indicator here of major victories for the hearts and minds in the battlefront.
[00:50:50.341 --> 00:50:53.522]  I am your wartime broadcaster from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:50:53.542 --> 00:50:56.784]  I am Alex Jones, and we'll come back and talk to
[00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:02.873]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.053 --> 00:51:06.155]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.296 --> 00:51:10.198]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.238 --> 00:51:14.481]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:14.821 --> 00:51:18.604]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.724 --> 00:51:20.525]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:21.125 --> 00:51:24.027]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[00:51:24.067 --> 00:51:28.791]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:28.951 --> 00:51:31.993]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.173 --> 00:51:35.015]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.515 --> 00:51:41.640]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:45.962]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:53:01.528 --> 00:53:01.848]  I think so.

[00:53:39.384 --> 00:53:40.205]  We're good to go!
[00:54:09.122 --> 00:54:13.760]  We got long time Senecata talk show host Raleigh James joining us in the next hour.
[00:54:15.962 --> 00:54:19.023]  And of course your phone calls will continue with just a ton of news.
[00:54:19.123 --> 00:54:22.785]  John and Newsstand Mo and Michael and many, many others.
[00:54:23.325 --> 00:54:31.748]  Before I jump back into your calls and more news we'll be covering with Raleigh James, just briefly my new film, American Dictators, documenting the stage election of 2004.
[00:54:32.268 --> 00:54:41.752]  This will be an important film after the election next week because it shows people how both candidates are related, members of the same groups, have the exact same policies, just different rhetoric.
[00:54:42.955 --> 00:54:49.842]  We cover the latest developments in 9-11, get into the stand-down drills, the latest police state info, we go back to Bohemian Grove.
[00:54:50.323 --> 00:54:53.686]  It's a great video on DVD, 115 minutes on VHS, about 95 minutes long.
[00:54:53.706 --> 00:54:55.228]  Each additional DVD is $5.95.
[00:54:55.288 --> 00:54:56.990]  Buy one for $19.95 and the next is $5.95.
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:06.482]  We can't offer that good of a deal on the VHS.
[00:55:06.543 --> 00:55:13.791]  It's $19.95 for one copy and then like $9.95 for each additional copy because VHS costs us like, you know, $4 or $5 if you use high quality tape.
[00:55:13.811 --> 00:55:15.693]  You can buy cheap tape and it's less than that.
[00:55:16.855 --> 00:55:18.116]  You know, to have it duplicated and all that.
[00:55:18.477 --> 00:55:22.061]  But again, go to PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com and

[00:56:20.109 --> 00:56:21.890]  Let's go ahead and go to John in Mass.
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:28.081]  Alex, how are you?
[00:56:28.201 --> 00:56:28.661]  Good, sir.
[00:56:29.201 --> 00:56:32.223]  Greetings from Police State 2004 here in Massachusetts.
[00:56:32.443 --> 00:56:35.025]  Where they kill young women and men just for fun.
[00:56:35.805 --> 00:56:36.266]  Exactly.
[00:56:36.286 --> 00:56:38.207]  It's been happening for a while now.
[00:56:39.588 --> 00:56:40.448]  I had a comment.
[00:56:40.488 --> 00:56:46.452]  I was watching your weekly report last week, and I noticed the owl symbolism in Austin.
[00:56:46.672 --> 00:56:48.153]  And I actually used to live in Austin.
[00:56:48.853 --> 00:56:53.296]  And whenever I would drive on the highway and could see the Tower of Texas, the UT Tower,
[00:56:54.525 --> 00:56:57.646]  When you hit it from the side view, you could see that it was an owl.
[00:56:58.667 --> 00:57:06.490]  Actually, on the UT website a couple years ago when they were building the new Frost Bank Tower that has a beak, two round eyes, horns, everything.
[00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:09.351]  While I was researching the tower, I heard that.
[00:57:09.371 --> 00:57:16.414]  I was sent a link to UT where it talked about the architect who was a mason, and it said that it's supposed to be an owl.
[00:57:16.794 --> 00:57:18.495]  So now we have the tower that's an owl.
[00:57:18.535 --> 00:57:20.656]  And again, this is kind of like the Globalist, one of their mascots.
[00:57:21.643 --> 00:57:26.405]  Uh, one of them's, you know, uh, the goat, and the other's the owl, the other's an Aladdin's lamp.
[00:57:26.685 --> 00:57:27.705]  We're still in crossbones.
[00:57:28.025 --> 00:57:29.086]  But the owl's one of their favorites.
[00:57:29.386 --> 00:57:31.367]  And now the new giant Frostbank Tower.
[00:57:31.407 --> 00:57:32.747]  I mean, everybody sends us an owl.
[00:57:33.507 --> 00:57:33.968]  Exactly.
[00:57:34.248 --> 00:57:36.469]  And there's still owl symbolism here in Boston.
[00:57:37.369 --> 00:57:42.931]  And, uh, one thing I wanted to just let you know on that symbol of Satan, the, uh, the horns that everyone throws up?
[00:57:43.191 --> 00:57:43.791]  Yes.
[00:57:44.612 --> 00:57:48.153]  Well, in Sicilian, um, symbolism,
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.100]  Part of my family is Sicilian.
[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:52.021]  That is called the Molokia.
[00:57:52.361 --> 00:57:54.542]  And it's called putting the Molok on somebody.
[00:57:55.162 --> 00:57:56.782]  So there you have again the symbol Molok.
[00:57:56.882 --> 00:58:04.085]  And they picked that up from the gypsies that lived in that area of Sicily.
[00:58:04.105 --> 00:58:05.705]  And the Italians picked that up.
[00:58:05.765 --> 00:58:07.506]  Yeah, that's putting the hex on somebody.
[00:58:07.926 --> 00:58:08.426]  Exactly.
[00:58:09.046 --> 00:58:12.767]  And just a comment on the... And again, we're not saying that stuff's real, folks.
[00:58:13.327 --> 00:58:14.988]  But that's where all these symbols come from.
[00:58:15.866 --> 00:58:18.749]  They certainly do, and there's a lot to it that we don't even know about just yet.
[00:58:20.290 --> 00:58:28.777]  As I was watching the events unfold last Wednesday on the Red Sox victory, what people don't see is the live coverage that was going on.
[00:58:28.817 --> 00:58:37.263]  You could see them firing canisters of gas into the crowd, people picking them up and throwing them back at the police, and they just edit that for the national news.
[00:58:37.304 --> 00:58:41.187]  But when you're watching it live and the cameraman is right in the crowd, you see a lot more than
[00:58:42.299 --> 00:58:45.003]  Well, we'll show you not to throw stuff at us.
[00:58:45.043 --> 00:58:46.464]  How about we just blow your heads off?
[00:58:46.785 --> 00:58:47.265]  Stay there.
[00:58:47.386 --> 00:58:49.228]  I want to hear about what you saw on local news.
[00:58:57.639 --> 00:58:58.299]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:58:59.942]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.712 --> 00:59:01.793]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.454 --> 00:59:03.275]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.035 --> 00:59:05.337]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.597 --> 00:59:09.240]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.801 --> 00:59:13.905]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.687 --> 00:59:24.015]  All right, my buddies, my friends, wonderful folks listening here in the United States on the MNFM dial, the short way to the internet, the satellite, and all the ships at sea.
[00:59:25.006 --> 00:59:27.527]  Thank you for joining us on this Tuesday edition.
[00:59:27.567 --> 00:59:33.048]  We are less than seven days away from Super Tuesday next week, my friends.
[00:59:33.108 --> 00:59:35.028]  And again, I am honored to be here.
[00:59:35.748 --> 00:59:37.829]  Just a little point of order for everybody.
[00:59:38.289 --> 00:59:44.070]  During the day, this broadcast has been on WWCR for the last eight, nine months.
[00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:46.430]  It's the last frequency change at 9.475.
[00:59:46.530 --> 00:59:47.171]  But starting Monday,
[00:59:55.772 --> 01:00:06.054]  Starting Monday, you will be hearing this broadcast at 9.985.
[01:00:07.354 --> 01:00:09.795]  9.985 during the day and it will stay 3210 at night.
[01:00:09.975 --> 01:00:15.696]  And I guess we're going to make that change at the GCNlive.com website so folks can get that.
[01:00:16.816 --> 01:00:22.857]  Let us go back to a caller from Boston who was there watching the local news versus the national news.
[01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:26.532]  To basically give us this view on inside censorship.
[01:00:26.772 --> 01:00:32.315]  Then we've got syndicated talk show host Raleigh James coming up to talk about current events, the election, the news, all of it with us.
[01:00:32.355 --> 01:00:35.217]  And of course, newsstand Moe and Michael and everybody else that's holding.
[01:00:35.777 --> 01:00:52.707]  But John, when I was in New York for the convention, cops would run over people with horses, mopeds, they would get mad and fight back, and on local news it would show that, but by the time I would then tune into CNN or Fox, after watching New York One, they would just show the people attacking and punching police,
[01:00:53.553 --> 01:00:56.156]  Now, you know, two or three people doing that, and then hundreds being arrested and beat up.
[01:00:56.977 --> 01:00:58.198]  Now, you're saying kind of the opposite.
[01:00:58.238 --> 01:01:04.945]  In Boston, it showed people throwing tear gas canisters back at the police, but then on national news, it didn't show that, which I agree with you.
[01:01:04.985 --> 01:01:05.526]  I didn't see that.
[01:01:06.387 --> 01:01:07.007]  Yeah.
[01:01:07.128 --> 01:01:11.152]  No, I can't say that they were tear gas, but they were definitely firing something into the crowd.
[01:01:11.352 --> 01:01:12.654]  Oh, and the people were throwing it back.
[01:01:12.694 --> 01:01:12.994]  I got you.
[01:01:13.433 --> 01:01:13.693]  Yes.
[01:01:14.574 --> 01:01:16.075]  Okay, well what was the provocation?
[01:01:16.115 --> 01:01:24.481]  Because local newspapers report that where this girl was killed, Snell Grove, that no one was rioting, no one was fighting back, they were just saying clear the streets.
[01:01:25.582 --> 01:01:31.006]  Well, as you watched, you could see the people on Lansdowne Street, which is right by Fenway Park,
[01:01:31.522 --> 01:01:33.023]  They were just all in the street.
[01:01:33.043 --> 01:01:34.684]  They closed down the street and that was fine.
[01:01:35.145 --> 01:01:43.871]  And then all of a sudden the riot brigade comes in and you could see them with their, you know, the jack-booted thugs coming in, closing off the street and then just moving down to clear the street.
[01:01:44.172 --> 01:01:45.553]  And the people weren't doing anything.
[01:01:45.573 --> 01:01:46.233]  There were no fights.
[01:01:46.273 --> 01:01:47.194]  There was nothing like that.
[01:01:47.214 --> 01:01:49.336]  That's what happens in Austin.
[01:01:49.376 --> 01:01:52.058]  They come to clear the streets and then people riot.
[01:01:53.038 --> 01:01:53.719]  That's what happened.
[01:01:54.495 --> 01:01:57.718]  And I mean, I can tell you, I watched it live on the news.
[01:01:57.998 --> 01:01:58.979]  It was on every station.
[01:01:59.059 --> 01:02:02.382]  I wish you would take that as solid gold to show people the fraud.
[01:02:03.503 --> 01:02:06.505]  It is, and I know a lot of people here saw that, which is very good.
[01:02:06.585 --> 01:02:07.346]  I'm glad they did.
[01:02:07.506 --> 01:02:10.549]  No, it's been in some of your local papers, but never on the national news.
[01:02:10.589 --> 01:02:18.495]  It's just like, first it was a few hundred were rioting, but by the time they killed the girl, 80,000 vicious, vampiric murderers slaughtering everyone.
[01:02:18.515 --> 01:02:19.957]  The police could barely hold them back.
[01:02:19.997 --> 01:02:20.877]  They had to do it.
[01:02:23.061 --> 01:02:25.102]  You know, those kids, they're mostly college kids.
[01:02:25.182 --> 01:02:26.642]  It's right by BU, Northeastern.
[01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:28.083]  Big college area.
[01:02:28.223 --> 01:02:30.483]  And it's just college kids that came down to celebrate.
[01:02:30.744 --> 01:02:33.224]  And, you know, the girl got killed.
[01:02:33.244 --> 01:02:34.185]  She was from Emerson College.
[01:02:34.205 --> 01:02:35.985]  She just went down to see what was going on.
[01:02:36.285 --> 01:02:38.566]  And it was just terrible.
[01:02:38.606 --> 01:02:43.028]  I mean, the scenes that we saw were a lot different than the scenes that you saw.
[01:02:43.968 --> 01:02:50.090]  And I just can't... That's why folks gotta pop a tape in and stuff like that's happening because
[01:02:51.078 --> 01:02:53.400]  You know, I've done this in documentaries and TV shows.
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:57.423]  We have gone over how they distort things.
[01:02:58.283 --> 01:03:03.487]  Well, if they do in the World Series, the tape will be in the cassette player and I'll be recording it.
[01:03:04.127 --> 01:03:04.668]  That's for sure.
[01:03:05.108 --> 01:03:08.030]  Well, hey, some of the neocons of this show, people will listen.
[01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:09.371]  Maybe there won't be any problems.
[01:03:09.431 --> 01:03:11.773]  Maybe their death serves a purpose.
[01:03:12.533 --> 01:03:13.914]  Isn't that sick?
[01:03:15.035 --> 01:03:15.856]  It's disgusting.
[01:03:18.343 --> 01:03:21.125]  I mean, I just want to mention something else that happened in our area.
[01:03:21.245 --> 01:03:25.987]  Right outside of Boston, the town that borders Boston, there's been high gang activity from an El Salvadoran gang.
[01:03:26.768 --> 01:03:30.089]  I think it's M-I-6-5-1-5 or something like that.
[01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:35.712]  They had raped two handicapped women in a park at night.
[01:03:36.713 --> 01:03:45.978]  And then the police used that as an excuse to have no loitering, people arrested on the corner, subject to search and seizure, and they do nothing about the illegal immigrants that are coming in.
[01:03:46.829 --> 01:03:47.610]  Well, of course not.
[01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:50.712]  They've got to create the crisis and then offer the solution.
[01:03:50.772 --> 01:03:51.393]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:53.174 --> 01:03:55.997]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[01:03:56.137 --> 01:03:56.958]  Michael Trudeau here.
[01:03:57.098 --> 01:04:00.380]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[01:04:00.581 --> 01:04:06.245]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[01:04:06.385 --> 01:04:09.408]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[01:04:09.648 --> 01:04:13.931]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[01:04:14.132 --> 01:04:16.033]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[01:04:16.153 --> 01:04:23.219]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[01:04:23.419 --> 01:04:25.881]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[01:04:26.181 --> 01:04:28.862]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice.
[01:04:29.002 --> 01:04:30.503]  Only this time, it changed my life.
[01:04:30.783 --> 01:04:32.523]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement.
[01:04:32.623 --> 01:04:34.744]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:37.345]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[01:04:37.405 --> 01:04:40.126]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[01:04:40.286 --> 01:04:40.827]  Side effects?
[01:04:40.987 --> 01:04:43.267]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[01:04:43.428 --> 01:04:44.728]  Call Kliscott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[01:04:44.748 --> 01:04:44.948]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[01:04:44.968 --> 01:04:45.768]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[01:04:45.788 --> 01:04:46.689]  It worked for me.
[01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:56.188]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:04:56.528 --> 01:04:59.411]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:04:59.631 --> 01:05:05.835]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[01:05:06.216 --> 01:05:13.541]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[01:05:13.701 --> 01:05:17.784]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[01:05:18.064 --> 01:05:23.607]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[01:05:23.807 --> 01:05:36.935]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.
[01:05:37.115 --> 01:05:40.937]  Get this hard-to-find information by ordering Food and Places U.S.A.
[01:05:41.137 --> 01:05:45.680]  now for only $29, plus shipping and handling, by calling New Millennium at
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:56.870]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:57.070 --> 01:06:01.475]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:01.615 --> 01:06:06.019]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:06:06.039 --> 01:06:07.421]  The New World Order.
[01:06:08.181 --> 01:06:09.121]  Panama!
[01:06:09.181 --> 01:06:13.402]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:13.462 --> 01:06:20.383]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:20.503 --> 01:06:22.584]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:22.884 --> 01:06:33.246]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:33.506 --> 01:06:34.846]  If you want to understand what the new
[01:06:35.086 --> 01:06:36.948]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:37.028 --> 01:06:38.589]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:00.547 --> 01:07:05.072]  All right, we are now eight minutes into the second hour on this Tuesday.
[01:07:05.372 --> 01:07:10.398]  Less than seven days, six and a half days, until the staged election of 2004.
[01:07:10.958 --> 01:07:12.480]  Your choice, Skull-R-Bone.
[01:07:13.201 --> 01:07:17.145]  In news, Stan Moe from South Austin, Michael in Florida.
[01:07:17.565 --> 01:07:18.786]  Everybody, your calls are coming up.
[01:07:18.807 --> 01:07:20.929]  We're taking lots of calls in this hour, into the next hour.
[01:07:21.866 --> 01:07:23.087]  Whatever issue you want to talk about.
[01:07:23.547 --> 01:07:26.929]  We've got a really great syndicated radio broadcaster joining us.
[01:07:26.969 --> 01:07:27.989]  She's Raleigh James.
[01:07:28.409 --> 01:07:30.250]  Her website's raleigh.net.
[01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:31.951]  That's two L's dot net.
[01:07:32.611 --> 01:07:37.454]  And her flagship station is 1210 WPHT out of Philadelphia.
[01:07:37.794 --> 01:07:39.055]  But she's on all over the country.
[01:07:39.075 --> 01:07:40.795]  She's on right here in Texas.
[01:07:41.116 --> 01:07:45.798]  And she helped wake me up eight, nine years ago listening to her here on local radio.
[01:07:45.898 --> 01:07:49.600]  And she was talking about Bill Clinton and Mena Arkansas before a lot of other people were.
[01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:59.008]  And so I've had a chance to be on her broadcast a few times, so I invited her on with us today to ride shotgun and cover a lot of the different news items with us.
[01:07:59.648 --> 01:08:01.430]  Raleigh James, great to have you on board with us.
[01:08:01.830 --> 01:08:02.931]  Thanks for asking me.
[01:08:03.011 --> 01:08:04.373]  Great to be on with you, Alex.
[01:08:04.653 --> 01:08:05.053]  You bet.
[01:08:05.814 --> 01:08:16.083]  Now, there is so much stuff happening and I want to talk about it with you, but first off, I want to hear your prediction for the election and just what you think about the whole scene that we're now witnessing.
[01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:19.956]  Well, the amazing part, of course, is the rampant voter fraud.
[01:08:20.016 --> 01:08:33.211]  When you look at machines where a third of them won't be able to be tallied in any real way with a paper trail, and when you look at the last-minute registrations that no registrar can really vet for accuracy, this sets the stage.
[01:08:33.391 --> 01:08:36.114]  And I think it's absolutely intentional.
[01:08:36.516 --> 01:08:47.821]  When you've got a candidate in Kerry who stands up and is proud that he has 10,000 lawyers ready to dispute any outcome that isn't in his favor, regardless of how close it is,
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:49.521]  You can see what's happening.
[01:08:49.561 --> 01:08:54.386]  And the real question is, will we know who's president before the inauguration in January?
[01:08:54.446 --> 01:08:55.106]  And I don't know.
[01:08:55.507 --> 01:08:57.288]  Well, when did things change in America?
[01:08:57.308 --> 01:09:00.451]  I mean, up until 2000, you knew who the president was.
[01:09:00.531 --> 01:09:08.018]  Voter News Services and their secret compound off 34th Street in New York with armed guards, with the CIA publicly running things, would magically tell you.
[01:09:08.238 --> 01:09:09.199]  That was the good old days.
[01:09:09.219 --> 01:09:10.220]  Is there some type of internal
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:17.404]  Fisher and the establishment where they just duke it out like mob bosses for territory because we have the Supreme Court appoint somebody.
[01:09:17.805 --> 01:09:20.707]  Last time we had Democrats caught in an election fraud.
[01:09:21.427 --> 01:09:23.188]  You know, kind of the little localized type.
[01:09:23.208 --> 01:09:27.251]  We have Republicans involved in industrialized election fraud.
[01:09:27.291 --> 01:09:36.877]  The Austin American Statesman and News 8 just reported that when you go vote straight ticket in Austin, it says in fine print, click here, or you actually vote for Cheney Bush.
[01:09:37.418 --> 01:09:39.499]  I mean, even where I live it's going on, Raleigh.
[01:09:40.274 --> 01:09:40.814]  Absolutely.
[01:09:40.954 --> 01:09:42.395]  I don't think things have changed.
[01:09:42.475 --> 01:09:43.755]  I think they've become public.
[01:09:43.795 --> 01:09:54.058]  You know, certainly in your great state of Texas, LBJ in 49 was a sterling example, and everybody knows about the isolated examples of daily and people like that.
[01:09:54.438 --> 01:09:57.459]  But I think there's always been rampant voter fraud.
[01:09:57.899 --> 01:10:02.960]  What's coming on now is that it's made public, and the question is why.
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:04.961]  And I think it's intentional.
[01:10:07.381 --> 01:10:08.622]  Okay, tell us why.
[01:10:08.842 --> 01:10:09.482]  What's the motive?
[01:10:10.117 --> 01:10:21.139]  Well, for one thing, you know, we've got FEMA in the wings at any time, ready to, of course, quell civil disobedience, as well as the occasional earthquake, or what have you.
[01:10:21.859 --> 01:10:28.320]  I think there's so many things that our country loves to, if not orchestrate, certainly pounce upon.
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:32.641]  2001, the biggest thing we got out of 9-11 was the Patriot Act.
[01:10:33.101 --> 01:10:39.182]  So, if we can't conduct an easy, free-flowing, accurate election, well then,
[01:10:39.625 --> 01:10:40.965]  Something's gotta be done.
[01:10:41.365 --> 01:10:42.105]  Well, I know this.
[01:10:42.125 --> 01:10:45.766]  I mean, I made two films, now three films about the police state, but now it's out in the open.
[01:10:46.346 --> 01:10:49.927]  I got the documents, and then later it was in the local paper, weeks after I reported on it.
[01:10:50.347 --> 01:10:56.268]  They have told the State Guard, the National Guard, this is all over the country, it's gonna happen, there's gonna be attacks, there's gonna be martial law.
[01:10:56.688 --> 01:11:01.889]  They're doing FEMA EAS alerts all over radio and TV now like I've never seen.
[01:11:02.549 --> 01:11:07.530]  Whether they pull off some type of crisis or not, they certainly trained us for in the future
[01:11:08.499 --> 01:11:09.439]  for this to happen.
[01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:16.942]  And yes, if there is a disputed election, which it now looks like it's going to happen, I'm predicting riots in a lot of major cities.
[01:11:17.722 --> 01:11:18.843]  Raleigh, what do you think is going to happen?
[01:11:19.303 --> 01:11:20.903]  I think that's entirely possible.
[01:11:21.104 --> 01:11:25.865]  What's amazing is that people think that this wasn't orchestrated.
[01:11:26.946 --> 01:11:35.149]  The concept of, like we've talked about, one-third of the voting machines being fully tamperable and in no way
[01:11:36.671 --> 01:11:41.153]  Will there be a paper trail or any form of way to go back in terms of accuracy?
[01:11:41.473 --> 01:11:51.178]  You're asking for trouble and it really makes you think that the old Chad they didn't like in 2000 had to be done away with because it actually was an accurate paper ballot.
[01:11:52.338 --> 01:11:53.099]  Well that's what they do.
[01:11:53.159 --> 01:12:04.464]  Problem, Reaction, Solution is that the Scantron or Punch type at least they can go back and hand count those and see how you really voted
[01:12:05.342 --> 01:12:10.745]  It is still fed through a computer, and they've been caught for decades engaging in fraud with those, but there's a trail.
[01:12:11.145 --> 01:12:15.608]  Now there's no trail, and we've had engineers quit the companies and say it's all a fraud.
[01:12:15.628 --> 01:12:19.490]  We've caught them with vice presidents of these companies being convicted felons for computer crimes.
[01:12:20.271 --> 01:12:20.651]  We've got
[01:12:21.579 --> 01:12:31.522]  You know, the head of Clear Channel, owning Hart InterCivics, and then running his own son-in-law in Austin on voting machines they own, Michael McCall.
[01:12:31.742 --> 01:12:35.583]  I mean, we've got all these... Senator Hagel owning his own machines in Nebraska.
[01:12:35.603 --> 01:12:40.065]  I mean, I guess you become a senator now by owning your own machines, getting them put in, and then running.
[01:12:41.485 --> 01:12:42.685]  It's so transparent.
[01:12:42.705 --> 01:12:43.426]  You make a good point.
[01:12:43.726 --> 01:12:46.347]  They're just flaunting it in our face and saying, what are you going to do about it?
[01:12:46.787 --> 01:12:50.948]  Well, that's exactly it, because as we say, it's been going on forever, but now it's highlighted.
[01:12:51.562 --> 01:12:57.529]  Interestingly, it's highlighted, but not in terms of the lead story on the evening news for the most part.
[01:12:57.949 --> 01:13:05.798]  It's still fascinating how the myth of the free press continues, that nobody's bringing up the scope of things the way you do.
[01:13:06.483 --> 01:13:11.447]  You know, if you were on the CBS Evening News tomorrow night, I'd fall over.
[01:13:11.527 --> 01:13:13.748]  You know, that's just not going to happen.
[01:13:13.768 --> 01:13:14.989]  Well, same thing if you were on there.
[01:13:15.029 --> 01:13:15.409]  I'd love it.
[01:13:15.650 --> 01:13:16.450]  Oh, yeah, right!
[01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:17.111]  Exactly!
[01:13:17.171 --> 01:13:19.472]  Well, I guarantee you we can sit it out.
[01:13:19.512 --> 01:13:21.353]  We're not going to be asked, you know.
[01:13:21.734 --> 01:13:27.678]  I was asked once to comment on MSNBC, and I called Hillary a dedicated Marxist, and I've never been called again.
[01:13:28.342 --> 01:13:46.257]  So I'm not surprised about any of that, but it is sad to note the myth of the free press, and that's part of the problem all down the line, which is why, thank God for what you're doing, it's just a shame that more people aren't hearing it.
[01:13:47.564 --> 01:13:55.607]  Bush says that he wants $70 billion more, plus a $30 billion supplemental before that, for the war.
[01:13:55.667 --> 01:13:57.147]  And Kerry says he wants even more.
[01:13:57.187 --> 01:13:59.308]  He's going to expand it even greater.
[01:13:59.508 --> 01:14:01.109]  What's the difference in these two candidates?
[01:14:01.469 --> 01:14:03.049]  Well, nothing as far as that goes.
[01:14:03.109 --> 01:14:05.790]  And whenever you have two parties, you don't have a difference.
[01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:08.571]  Because they both can make agreements behind the scenes.
[01:14:08.651 --> 01:14:10.172]  And it's one party with two heads.
[01:14:10.732 --> 01:14:12.293]  And they all divide and conquer.
[01:14:12.373 --> 01:14:16.114]  If they can take us and have us fighting against one another,
[01:14:16.913 --> 01:14:17.334]  I think it's
[01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:40.333]  Whomever is going to advance the portion of the agenda they're trying for.
[01:14:40.353 --> 01:14:45.076]  If Ed Gore had gotten in in 2000, the Patriot Act would have been very hard to pull off.
[01:14:45.177 --> 01:14:53.943]  If nothing else, the talking heads like Rush and everybody else on Hannity, everybody else on the radio would have gone nuts about the Patriot Act under Gore.
[01:14:54.303 --> 01:15:01.888]  But under Bush, they're fine with that, which is the part that really slays me, that they don't understand that Bush won't be in forever.
[01:15:02.349 --> 01:15:05.091]  When the next guy comes in, he's got those powers too!
[01:15:06.385 --> 01:15:07.205]  Well, exactly.
[01:15:07.265 --> 01:15:28.111]  I mean, can you imagine if it was Al Gore saying, total blanket amnesty, Al Gore, assault weapons ban, Al Gore, I want open borders, Al Gore, you know, all of this, the Patriot Act, Patriot Act II, secret arrest, there's no way they would ever put up with this for a single, solitary second.
[01:15:28.391 --> 01:15:31.772]  But then George Bush comes in and does it, and they think it's the second coming of Christ.
[01:15:32.252 --> 01:15:34.933]  I've heard them even imply that he's like God's messenger,
[01:15:35.968 --> 01:15:37.690]  Some type of new profit.
[01:15:37.710 --> 01:15:46.761]  You know this ad where he's hugging the 9-11 victim's daughter and it says that her life was ruined by her mother's death but now Bush healed her.
[01:15:47.281 --> 01:15:48.342]  I mean this is getting sick.
[01:15:48.362 --> 01:15:49.404]  Have you seen that TV ad?
[01:15:49.724 --> 01:15:52.727]  Oh yeah, you mean the heal of a hug?
[01:15:52.807 --> 01:15:54.950]  I mean for a minute there I thought he was Benny Hinn.
[01:15:54.990 --> 01:15:56.572]  I wasn't sure what to make of that.
[01:15:57.988 --> 01:16:06.890]  Absolutely, and that's the part that I don't get, is how individuals can be so fooled to think that there's somehow a difference.
[01:16:07.290 --> 01:16:15.272]  And that's why, in terms of ultimately when the dust settles, who gets in, I think the answer is really what portion of the agenda are they trying for now?
[01:16:15.512 --> 01:16:19.453]  Well, you predicted that, I mean, you said you agreed with me the other night on your show that I think it's going to be Bush.
[01:16:19.813 --> 01:16:26.135]  Yes, I really do think it's going to be Bush, because I think they have more work on getting our rights through Patriot 2.
[01:16:27.063 --> 01:16:34.852]  I think that we are having a national ID in the form of a 50-state driver's license with the information they'll share everywhere.
[01:16:35.232 --> 01:16:48.267]  And I think all those things have to go in seamlessly before they come back for their next attack, which will be the more obvious, including, ultimately, for them to take over, they've got to get our guns.
[01:16:49.938 --> 01:16:52.579]  Well, Bush, he wants the assault weapons ban.
[01:16:53.319 --> 01:16:56.040]  Some good news for folks that just joined us, there is some good news.
[01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:58.961]  Georgia Supreme Court throws out hate crimes law.
[01:16:59.581 --> 01:17:06.403]  The Georgia Supreme Court unanimously threw out the state's hate crimes law Monday, calling it overbroad and unconstitutionally vague.
[01:17:06.763 --> 01:17:13.105]  The four-year-old law calls for stiffer criminal penalties for crimes in which a victim was chosen because of any bias or prejudice.
[01:17:13.165 --> 01:17:15.226]  But now they're being used just for what you say or do.
[01:17:16.184 --> 01:17:19.286]  We're now following EU laws, the Supreme Court has said.
[01:17:20.006 --> 01:17:24.569]  They just grabbed IndyMedia servers because the Italian court wanted it because of its speech.
[01:17:25.089 --> 01:17:32.413]  The 7-0 ruling came in the case of a man and woman convicted of an assault on two black men in Atlanta's Little Five Points neighborhood.
[01:17:33.113 --> 01:17:34.994]  And the point here is, is a crime's a crime.
[01:17:35.074 --> 01:17:38.196]  All crimes are, you know, hateful or at least you're disregarding somebody.
[01:17:38.236 --> 01:17:46.100]  But in Pennsylvania, they passed a law where they told preachers, you better watch what you read out of a Bible, because it may incite somebody to do something.
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:47.641]  So that's where this is all going.
[01:17:47.701 --> 01:17:48.001]  Raleigh?
[01:17:48.401 --> 01:17:49.362]  Well, absolutely.
[01:17:49.402 --> 01:17:58.707]  Now, sadly, I was really excited about the Georgia headline, but when I read further as to why the Supreme Court made this decision, I was a little less jubilant.
[01:17:58.847 --> 01:18:01.128]  What they said is it was overly broad.
[01:18:01.684 --> 01:18:12.267]  And they pretty much sent it back to the legislature, because as it was, they said, right now this could be applied to a sports fan wearing a cap other than the Braves at the game.
[01:18:12.567 --> 01:18:20.410]  And by the way, they were given a much larger sentence because when they punched them, they screamed racial epithets.
[01:18:20.690 --> 01:18:26.512]  Well, folks... Exactly, and you know, this is so frightening, and we're seeing this all over the place, and it's frightening on two
[01:18:27.631 --> 01:18:28.172]  Two things.
[01:18:29.453 --> 01:18:38.401]  The biggest of which, of course, is it says that the crime of beating up a protected minority is greater than the crime of beating up a white guy.
[01:18:38.561 --> 01:18:40.082]  We've got to get Part 2 when we get back.
[01:18:40.162 --> 01:18:43.065]  It makes super-citizens and for selective enforcement.
[01:18:43.365 --> 01:18:45.387]  Raleigh James is our guest and again a talk show host.
[01:18:45.947 --> 01:18:47.689]  Here, a program all over the country.
[01:18:48.009 --> 01:18:50.812]  We'll be back, cover more, take your calls as well, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:18:53.789 --> 01:18:55.271]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[01:18:55.571 --> 01:19:00.156]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[01:19:00.496 --> 01:19:02.839]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[01:19:03.059 --> 01:19:04.580]  Achieve financial independence.
[01:19:04.961 --> 01:19:10.066]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[01:19:10.367 --> 01:19:11.588]  Get the Red Book of the U.S.

[01:19:53.132 --> 01:19:56.594]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:19:56.874 --> 01:20:00.356]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[01:20:04.658 --> 01:20:10.781]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:20:11.202 --> 01:20:19.106]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:20:19.526 --> 01:20:24.871]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.
[01:20:25.011 --> 01:20:28.794]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:20:29.155 --> 01:20:31.016]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.
[01:20:31.076 --> 01:20:33.258]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.

[01:20:52.711 --> 01:20:55.192]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:55.912 --> 01:21:01.133]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[01:21:01.993 --> 01:21:08.815]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[01:21:09.921 --> 01:21:18.527]  If so, why is Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[01:21:19.607 --> 01:21:27.632]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:29.073 --> 01:21:30.914]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.

[01:21:51.610 --> 01:21:54.651]  You and your family members gaining enough minerals in the daily diet?
[01:21:55.011 --> 01:21:57.531]  It's not likely according to the World Health Organization.
[01:21:57.751 --> 01:22:04.833]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[01:22:05.013 --> 01:22:08.314]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[01:22:08.554 --> 01:22:10.574]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[01:22:10.914 --> 01:22:18.736]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[01:22:19.016 --> 01:22:20.297]  Either way, why chance it?
[01:22:20.417 --> 01:22:30.364]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call to Sea Minerals at 877-835-5555 and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost to the immune system.

[01:23:07.772 --> 01:23:08.612]  Welcome back folks.
[01:23:08.652 --> 01:23:12.135]  Your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes for everybody that's patiently holding.
[01:23:12.155 --> 01:23:15.358]  We're talking to Raleigh James and it's Raleigh.net
[01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:22.218]  And, Raleigh, you were continuing talking about this hate crimes legislation.
[01:23:22.258 --> 01:23:31.148]  I mean, it starts out as, well, it's a greater sentence if you do something racially or against a certain sexual preference group.
[01:23:31.843 --> 01:23:34.104]  I mean, all crime, obviously, should be treated the same.
[01:23:34.404 --> 01:23:36.524]  But then you look at Europe, and now even some states.
[01:23:37.025 --> 01:23:39.605]  Then it's people being convicted just for saying something.
[01:23:40.086 --> 01:23:41.226]  Oh, well, that's hateful.
[01:23:41.586 --> 01:23:44.167]  So we see this growing into what we always feared.
[01:23:44.207 --> 01:23:46.748]  But you're part two of what your concern was.
[01:23:47.008 --> 01:23:49.428]  It's just where you're going, and that is the thought police.
[01:23:49.608 --> 01:23:55.730]  Because the only way you can classify a hate crime is to classify what people are thinking.
[01:23:55.770 --> 01:23:58.031]  Not everybody's going to yell a racial epithet.
[01:23:58.599 --> 01:24:05.842]  And so consequently now, it's not your actions, and in some cases it's not even your words, it's your thoughts.
[01:24:06.402 --> 01:24:10.964]  But regard to your words, this is morphing into something so unbelievable.
[01:24:10.984 --> 01:24:25.790]  The case that I'm sure you know about, it wasn't criminal, it was civil, but nonetheless in Canada, where a used car salesman, who are normally not, you know, the bastions of good taste anyway, referred to a gay customer as a Fifi.
[01:24:26.591 --> 01:24:29.474]  And the gay customer sued him and won!
[01:24:30.114 --> 01:24:35.399]  The court upheld that referring to him as a Fifi was in fact worthy of a financial award.
[01:24:35.559 --> 01:24:39.722]  Now again, a Fifi is like saying you're a flamer or you're a sissy.
[01:24:39.902 --> 01:24:41.003]  Right, exactly!
[01:24:41.023 --> 01:24:42.104]  You know, what a wuss.
[01:24:42.224 --> 01:24:43.305]  That kind of a thing.
[01:24:43.345 --> 01:24:44.086]  You're a pussy.
[01:24:44.705 --> 01:24:46.827]  And so, you know, oh, he's a fifi.
[01:24:47.007 --> 01:24:54.732]  And that gave him, I guess, a $1,500 fine, which went to the quote-unquote victim.
[01:24:54.812 --> 01:25:04.679]  So now you call somebody a pussycat, or you call somebody a fifi, like the lady on Green Acres, or you call somebody just the most, you know, you're a wimp, you're a chicken.
[01:25:04.699 --> 01:25:08.881]  Yeah, I saw that case, and more and more of this is happening.
[01:25:09.282 --> 01:25:12.584]  I'm sure you saw last year when Mark Schweiker of Pennsylvania
[01:25:13.266 --> 01:25:21.616]  Passed that law, and they then warned the churches that if you read these Old Testament verses, you could lose your 501c3 or be arrested.
[01:25:21.636 --> 01:25:23.258]  Oh, absolutely!
[01:25:23.298 --> 01:25:27.883]  And in Canada, they're going after the newspapers saying you can't accept advertisement like that.
[01:25:28.436 --> 01:25:31.758]  And so, absolutely, they mean that.
[01:25:31.898 --> 01:25:33.920]  So, you're right.
[01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:43.967]  Preaching directly out of what was considered to be a standard upon which this country's principles were formed is now, in fact, a hate crime.
[01:25:45.074 --> 01:25:49.976]  And so the Georgia Supreme Court didn't say it was overall bad, just that it's too overly broad.
[01:25:50.176 --> 01:25:50.736]  Exactly.
[01:25:50.816 --> 01:26:00.840]  And so the legislator who first got it through has already said he's drafted the new wording to put it through in the next session.
[01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:02.860]  It's unbelievable.
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:11.523]  And again, folks, you should have your right, you know, if you're a Christian, to say you don't agree with devil worshippers, or if you're a devil worshipper to say you don't agree with Christians.
[01:26:11.963 --> 01:26:13.404]  I mean, it's your right to say it.
[01:26:14.065 --> 01:26:15.106]  Well, of course it is.
[01:26:15.226 --> 01:26:34.457]  And you know, in terms of these hate things, as I'm sitting here thinking, I think the worst case I ever ran across, and I'm sure you know this well, was the Idaho case, where at a ball game, a guy got very upset at an official, and the official had shoved his wife... Well, she was actually strangling her with the cord of her camera.
[01:26:34.777 --> 01:26:35.358]  Exactly.
[01:26:35.438 --> 01:26:39.260]  Had physically accosted her to the point that she needed medical treatment.
[01:26:40.204 --> 01:26:47.371]  All the guy did was yell the well-known N-word, and he was the one charged.
[01:26:48.146 --> 01:26:52.008]  I actually interviewed him, and he said, look, the other guy yelled at me first.
[01:26:52.028 --> 01:26:53.308]  You see, the news left that out.
[01:26:54.148 --> 01:27:03.152]  His wife wrote for the paper, she was fired, he lost his job, and in front of the crowd, he was pushing her down to the ground, tapped the thing around her neck, choking her.
[01:27:03.192 --> 01:27:10.375]  That was admitted in the newspaper, but then it didn't matter, because he couldn't do wrong, only the white person could.
[01:27:10.675 --> 01:27:12.036]  Right, and he wasn't charged.
[01:27:12.076 --> 01:27:15.098]  It would be one thing, it would be bad enough if they were both charged.
[01:27:15.158 --> 01:27:18.640]  Him for his words, and the black guy for his actions.
[01:27:19.201 --> 01:27:22.963]  But, in fact, the black guy was not charged for actions.
[01:27:23.383 --> 01:27:25.665]  The white guy was charged for words.
[01:27:25.845 --> 01:27:28.667]  And by the way, that wasn't in liberal Massachusetts or something.
[01:27:28.707 --> 01:27:29.727]  That was in Idaho.
[01:27:30.028 --> 01:27:38.333]  Well, it was in knee-jerk reaction Idaho, where there are individuals very afraid of standpoints in other areas where there have been
[01:27:38.757 --> 01:27:40.499]  Very vocal white supremacist.
[01:27:40.619 --> 01:27:45.045]  So a portion of the state had to say, well, we're not like that.
[01:27:45.532 --> 01:27:47.433]  So it was an overreaction.
[01:27:47.453 --> 01:27:47.513]  See?
[01:27:47.893 --> 01:27:49.473]  And again, he lost his job.
[01:27:49.573 --> 01:27:50.694]  She lost her job.
[01:27:50.754 --> 01:27:57.036]  And it's admitted with all these witnesses, it was in the paper, that this referee was choking her for taking his picture.
[01:27:57.476 --> 01:27:57.716]  Right.
[01:27:58.296 --> 01:27:58.556]  Right.
[01:27:58.736 --> 01:28:00.377]  Exactly right.
[01:28:00.817 --> 01:28:01.657]  Well, here's an example.
[01:28:01.697 --> 01:28:02.337]  Here's an example.
[01:28:03.518 --> 01:28:10.500]  Who knows that two years ago, five black men drug a white homeless man to his death in Jasper, Texas on the same stretch of road.
[01:28:11.661 --> 01:28:14.224]  That was in the Associated Press, but never in the news.
[01:28:14.925 --> 01:28:16.727]  I called up the sheriff, I said, come on about this.
[01:28:16.747 --> 01:28:17.668]  He said, no way, no way.
[01:28:17.688 --> 01:28:18.349]  And I go, why?
[01:28:18.369 --> 01:28:19.530]  And he goes, I'm just not gonna touch it.
[01:28:20.171 --> 01:28:28.080]  So, horrible racist white men drag a black man to death, and it's horrible, but then somebody else does the same thing, and we're just not gonna talk about this, Rowley.
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:29.121]  Exactly.
[01:28:29.818 --> 01:28:32.180]  And that is utterly alarming.
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:35.222]  Well, it might be racist to be against black racists.
[01:28:35.483 --> 01:28:38.745]  But it's again part of that divide and conquer.
[01:28:39.026 --> 01:28:42.649]  We'll be right back with your calls and a lot of news with Alex Jones.
[01:28:43.649 --> 01:28:44.610]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.630 --> 01:28:46.712]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.732 --> 01:28:50.255]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.542 --> 01:28:55.904]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:28:56.164 --> 01:28:59.987]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:29:00.327 --> 01:29:01.128]  Read the labels.
[01:29:01.568 --> 01:29:05.691]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:29:05.911 --> 01:29:10.094]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:29:10.474 --> 01:29:15.338]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:29:15.718 --> 01:29:19.320]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:24.843]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:29:25.103 --> 01:29:27.844]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:29:28.144 --> 01:29:29.045]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:29:29.345 --> 01:29:40.070]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[01:29:52.901 --> 01:29:59.146]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:29:59.286 --> 01:30:05.451]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:30:05.731 --> 01:30:14.178]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:30:14.418 --> 01:30:21.444]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:30:21.744 --> 01:30:26.566]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:30:26.786 --> 01:30:32.188]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:30:32.528 --> 01:30:35.609]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:30:35.929 --> 01:30:43.932]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:43.952 --> 01:30:44.512]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:54.366 --> 01:30:55.286]  Next Wednesday night.
[01:30:57.447 --> 01:31:00.208]  What America needs is affordable health insurance.
[01:31:01.069 --> 01:31:05.891]  Finding affordable health insurance for you and your family, it's on everybody's mind right now.
[01:31:05.931 --> 01:31:08.912]  And if you're self-employed, it's on your mind too.
[01:31:09.052 --> 01:31:14.034]  Well, I found a company you can call right now and get the affordable health insurance coverage you're looking for.
[01:31:14.174 --> 01:31:17.235]  The Midwest National Life Insurance Company of Tennessee.
[01:31:17.496 --> 01:31:18.416]  Write this number down.
[01:31:19.317 --> 01:31:19.397]  800-807-5989.
[01:31:20.677 --> 01:31:24.720]  That's 800-807-5989.
[01:31:25.100 --> 01:31:36.768]  They specialize in helping entrepreneurs of all kinds and those of us who run small businesses or don't get health insurance where we work to protect our families with the health insurance we need.
[01:31:37.308 --> 01:31:41.329]  And if you have a Cobra plan that's about to expire, we can help you too.
[01:31:41.429 --> 01:31:42.869]  So call us right now.
[01:31:42.889 --> 01:31:43.129]  800-807-5989.
[01:31:43.209 --> 01:31:43.390]  That's 800-807-5989.
[01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:44.570]  Not available in all states.
[01:31:44.590 --> 01:31:46.690]  I was doing another Hans Blix imitation.
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:09.222]  And, uh, Scott almost put me up on air while I was doing it.
[01:32:11.483 --> 01:32:13.024]  Kim Jong-il doing Hans Blix.
[01:32:13.665 --> 01:32:14.725]  Oh, Hans Blix!
[01:32:14.765 --> 01:32:16.026]  How you doing, buddy?
[01:32:16.146 --> 01:32:16.807]  Hans Blix!
[01:32:17.227 --> 01:32:18.668]  I just can't help it, I'm sorry.
[01:32:19.308 --> 01:32:21.290]  People who haven't seen it have no idea what I'm talking about.
[01:32:21.310 --> 01:32:24.492]  Uh, we're about to go back to Raleigh James, Raleigh.net.
[01:32:25.352 --> 01:32:28.434]  And that's R-O-L-L-Y-E, Raleigh.net.
[01:32:28.595 --> 01:32:35.099]  Great website, great syndicated broadcaster who helped wake me up almost a decade ago and I heard it here locally on the radio in Austin.
[01:32:36.710 --> 01:32:37.510]  And we're going to go to news.
[01:32:37.570 --> 01:32:42.633]  Stan Moe and Michael and Johnny and David and John and everybody else is patiently holding 1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:43.193 --> 01:32:46.354]  A bunch of other news coming up as well.
[01:32:46.674 --> 01:32:50.056]  We'll get Raleigh James' precise take on all of this.
[01:32:50.136 --> 01:32:51.537]  Very well informed, as you just noticed.
[01:32:51.557 --> 01:32:59.260]  Before we go back to Raleigh James, I do want to encourage every single scintilla of individuals out there who have been procrastinating
[01:32:59.983 --> 01:33:13.496]  To go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and to go to my secure online shopping cart and watch the free clips of my videos, read about the different specials we offer, the different films and books that I've produced, and the films that
[01:33:14.634 --> 01:33:15.815]  And books that we also carry.
[01:33:16.335 --> 01:33:19.957]  You need to go to nfowars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[01:33:20.317 --> 01:33:22.238]  A lot of new specials we're offering.
[01:33:22.278 --> 01:33:23.098]  Holiday specials.
[01:33:23.218 --> 01:33:30.842]  Instead of giving somebody a fruitcake or a tie or some horrible sweater that they won't wear, they'll give it to somebody else next year.
[01:33:30.942 --> 01:33:34.164]  Give them a VHS or DVD of 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:33:34.624 --> 01:33:36.305]  Find out what really happened on September 11th.
[01:33:36.505 --> 01:33:38.186]  Part 2 of that, The Masters of Terror.
[01:33:38.646 --> 01:33:42.408]  Or one of my newest police state films, Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[01:33:42.868 --> 01:33:46.011]  That really is, uh, details the New World Order's criminal activities.
[01:33:46.452 --> 01:33:48.954]  And my new film, American Dictators, on VHS and DVD.
[01:33:49.375 --> 01:33:55.020]  Buy one copy for $19.95, each additional copy on DVD $5.95 to give as a gift.
[01:33:55.521 --> 01:34:01.247]  Or you're authorized to make copies of all the films I produce for non-profit, educational, not-for-sale purposes.
[01:34:01.747 --> 01:34:03.368]  Here is the toll-free number to get my videos.
[01:34:03.388 --> 01:34:03.468]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:34:03.488 --> 01:34:04.369]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:34:04.389 --> 01:34:05.850]  Or just write to me.
[01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:09.873]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:34:26.869 --> 01:34:27.549]  Take action.
[01:34:27.589 --> 01:34:28.569]  Start waking people up.
[01:34:28.949 --> 01:34:30.610]  The awakening is accelerating.
[01:34:30.670 --> 01:34:31.970]  Minds are ready to be unlocked.
[01:34:32.350 --> 01:34:33.770]  It's up to you to take action.
[01:34:33.790 --> 01:34:36.211]  I think my videos are some of the best tools out there.
[01:34:37.051 --> 01:34:38.491]  Going back to Raleigh James.
[01:34:39.191 --> 01:34:42.852]  Raleigh, I want to get into UK Prime Minister announces plans for national ID card.
[01:34:43.932 --> 01:34:45.532]  At least they admitted over there.
[01:34:45.952 --> 01:34:47.313]  Here they're more sneaky about it.
[01:34:47.713 --> 01:34:49.533]  Also betting on bagging Osama.
[01:34:49.873 --> 01:34:52.594]  Journalist wager on exact day of bin Laden capture.
[01:34:53.014 --> 01:34:54.194]  Toronto star.
[01:34:55.071 --> 01:34:58.777]  And then we've got generals saying Bin Laden is located, but they're not allowed to go get him.
[01:34:59.798 --> 01:35:06.669]  Also, now it's come out that British agents engineered the capture of CARES international Margaret Hassan.
[01:35:08.307 --> 01:35:16.070]  And over and over again with these beheadings and the rest of it, Iraqi forces or FBI over there, our government, grabs the person and gives it to a car of Al-Qaeda.
[01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:20.352]  This is like BBC Associated Press, but as Raleigh said, it's never on the nightly news.
[01:35:20.372 --> 01:35:22.373]  I want to get her take on that as well.
[01:35:22.393 --> 01:35:23.073]  A lot more coming up.
[01:35:23.093 --> 01:35:24.894]  She's going to be with us halfway in the next hour.
[01:35:24.934 --> 01:35:25.694]  We're so honored.
[01:35:26.094 --> 01:35:32.397]  But Raleigh, before we go to these calls, tell folks about your radio broadcast, Raleigh.net, and how people tune into it.
[01:35:33.211 --> 01:35:35.393]  Well, in terms of the website, that's it.
[01:35:35.553 --> 01:35:36.453]  Raleigh.net.
[01:35:36.593 --> 01:35:41.497]  And that'll probably tell you all you want to know on the homepage is a little rundown of what we're talking about each night.
[01:35:41.557 --> 01:35:46.180]  But it really is, much like your show, a stream of consciousness based upon what's happening on the news.
[01:35:46.770 --> 01:35:55.400]  And it's just, you know, we're both lucky to have the power of a microphone to say what we'd otherwise be saying over a lunch table.
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:36:04.570]  And it shows that our ideas have entree with the people that, no matter how radical what we're saying sounds, we're both on a lot of AM and FM stations.
[01:36:04.611 --> 01:36:05.431]  We should be on more.
[01:36:05.451 --> 01:36:07.334]  I mean, we don't have problems getting ratings.
[01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:11.592]  Well, you know, the interesting thing, though, is that time has helped us.
[01:36:11.772 --> 01:36:18.555]  When I was first talking about many of these things, you know, 20 years ago, people just assumed I was the lunatic fringe.
[01:36:19.015 --> 01:36:25.778]  But what's happened over the years is that things that you were predicting seven, eight years ago, they've come to pass.
[01:36:25.958 --> 01:36:29.920]  And now even your greatest naysayers, if they're honest, have to admit
[01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:34.632]  That much of what you said, this is what's going down, has gone down.
[01:36:34.692 --> 01:36:36.974]  There are still individuals who don't see it yet.
[01:36:37.154 --> 01:36:46.539]  But for anybody who was warned way back when, even if they steadfastly said, this is just a crock, well, they've seen it come to pass.
[01:36:47.699 --> 01:36:48.760]  They certainly have.
[01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:55.684]  And again, you're on a 50,000 water that covers several states, 1210 WPHT, what, from 9 to midnight?
[01:36:55.764 --> 01:36:56.624]  Central time, yes.
[01:36:56.644 --> 01:36:57.084]  9 to midnight.
[01:37:00.271 --> 01:37:05.335]  And might have another large station in Texas coming on, but I'll just leave that there.
[01:37:05.395 --> 01:37:12.881]  Well, I know you've got a lot of affiliates out there, because every time I'm interviewed by you the couple times, I get emails from Texas listeners.
[01:37:12.921 --> 01:37:17.785]  I know you're on quite a bit in East Texas, and there's a smattering of stations across the country.
[01:37:17.805 --> 01:37:20.326]  Can folks find out how to find those stations on your website?
[01:37:20.687 --> 01:37:26.091]  Yeah, I'll tell you what my biggest help is, amazingly, is XM Satellite Radio.
[01:37:26.499 --> 01:37:32.964]  There are more people who are XM subscribers, and I think that blankets the country much more than any individual.
[01:37:33.224 --> 01:37:35.646]  See, to show my ignorance, I didn't know you were on XM.
[01:37:36.046 --> 01:37:39.389]  Oh yeah, XM Channel 165, the Ask Channel.
[01:37:40.030 --> 01:37:45.754]  So I'm on right before Coast to Coast, so I'm a great lead-in for them, and they're a wonderful following for me.
[01:37:45.874 --> 01:37:48.636]  Well, I was honored to be on your show for two and a half hours the other night.
[01:37:48.716 --> 01:37:49.957]  I really appreciate that, Raleigh.
[01:37:50.138 --> 01:37:55.001]  Oh, I was delighted to have you, and already I've gotten a ton of emails, when's Alex coming back?
[01:37:56.377 --> 01:37:56.737]  All right.
[01:37:57.398 --> 01:37:59.379]  Well, again, folks, give her a listen.
[01:37:59.419 --> 01:38:00.099]  It's great stuff.
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:01.320]  I mean, she helped wake me up.
[01:38:01.841 --> 01:38:06.043]  Let's go ahead now and take another call here, or take a first call here.
[01:38:06.444 --> 01:38:07.324]  I'll be still there.
[01:38:07.644 --> 01:38:09.646]  This is Newsstand Moe.
[01:38:10.566 --> 01:38:11.307]  Interesting name.
[01:38:11.467 --> 01:38:12.047]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:38:12.067 --> 01:38:14.229]  Hey, good old Crazy Moe here.
[01:38:14.269 --> 01:38:20.993]  I've got that Hegelian dialectic song to you in the mail, and you can totally use it.
[01:38:21.133 --> 01:38:22.074]  It's yours to use.
[01:38:22.114 --> 01:38:22.654]  Well, thank you.
[01:38:22.854 --> 01:38:23.995]  What's on your mind with all the news?
[01:38:24.625 --> 01:38:45.182]  Okay, well, first off with the whole owl thing that we were talking about earlier, and there's a book called the Necronomicon, which is an alleged magical tome to conjure up demons, and whether it's real or not, strangely enough, in it, it warns about the servants of the owl.
[01:38:45.202 --> 01:38:47.343]  I thought that was pretty strange.
[01:38:51.215 --> 01:38:53.556]  Over a thousand years, and they say, well, is it real?
[01:38:53.596 --> 01:38:54.317]  Well, was it real?
[01:38:54.337 --> 01:38:55.758]  Did it really come from Solomon?
[01:38:56.098 --> 01:38:57.759]  And again, I don't believe in this stuff.
[01:38:57.819 --> 01:38:58.859]  I don't believe in hexes.
[01:38:58.899 --> 01:38:59.500]  I don't believe in that.
[01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:06.383]  The point is, is that the global elite, and we all know about Nancy Reagan, Reagan couldn't make a decision unless the astrologer said do it.
[01:39:06.603 --> 01:39:13.127]  Well, that's tame compared to Roosevelt's wife conjuring, you know, entities and spirits in the White House.
[01:39:13.927 --> 01:39:22.290]  Clinton, Hillary Clinton getting shaman blessings, and then the Skull and Bones is a cult, and they're obsessed with numerology, and I snuck into Bohemian Grove.
[01:39:22.670 --> 01:39:27.671]  They really believe in this, and yeah, they put their owls and all this architecture on the buildings.
[01:39:28.411 --> 01:39:31.712]  Raleigh, from your study of just politics in the news, I never believed this stuff.
[01:39:31.992 --> 01:39:33.153]  I just kept running into it.
[01:39:33.173 --> 01:39:37.814]  Do you have any comments about the elite being a bunch of superstitious wackos?
[01:39:38.334 --> 01:40:00.192]  Yeah, it is absolutely unbelievable in terms of when you first tell people about Bohemian Grove and all that kind of stuff, but in terms of its success rate, you know, the mind is a very powerful thing, and very often what individuals believe follows through and manifests, and that's why it's been around for over a thousand years.
[01:40:00.552 --> 01:40:05.556]  I think most of the people dabbling in it don't realize that they're very often playing with evil,
[01:40:06.007 --> 01:40:14.194]  But that's the problem with everything from Ouija boards to owls, is that these are individuals who should not be messing with these things.
[01:40:15.294 --> 01:40:25.102]  But it's our president and the vice president, or the would-be president, were born again to the order of death, a German chapter of the Illuminati.
[01:40:25.142 --> 01:40:26.884]  I mean, that's MSNBC.
[01:40:27.184 --> 01:40:28.125]  That's another thing, Raleigh.
[01:40:28.545 --> 01:40:29.606]  Just a few years ago,
[01:40:30.755 --> 01:40:32.175]  I mean, I wouldn't talk about this stuff.
[01:40:32.215 --> 01:40:33.116]  It's so crazy sounding.
[01:40:33.396 --> 01:40:34.776]  Now it's mainstream news.
[01:40:34.856 --> 01:40:38.637]  Why are we seeing just this, you know, this flooding of this stuff in our face?
[01:40:39.097 --> 01:40:44.519]  Well, again, I think that it's out there to almost debunk it.
[01:40:44.859 --> 01:40:47.960]  It's presented as if it's nothing more than Boy Scout camp.
[01:40:48.642 --> 01:40:53.544]  And for a lot of the participants, I think they believe that as well.
[01:40:53.984 --> 01:41:00.006]  I think most of the people dealing in it have no idea what the symbolism really entails.
[01:41:00.086 --> 01:41:06.188]  So I think it's in the news to kind of demystify it, desensitize us,
[01:41:06.630 --> 01:41:11.231]  And also, get us ready for, you know, hey, your leaders are doing this.
[01:41:11.371 --> 01:41:12.591]  What could be wrong with it?
[01:41:12.871 --> 01:41:22.353]  Well, that's how real cults work, is you have the outer group, or the profane, and then the inner initiates, you know, the choir, the preacher, his deacons.
[01:41:22.753 --> 01:41:24.954]  I mean, that's really what I saw at Bohemian Grove.
[01:41:24.994 --> 01:41:30.155]  Fifteen hundred people across a little pond, and then about a hundred in priest robes doing the ceremony.
[01:41:31.095 --> 01:41:34.457]  And that's how society's broken up, kind of this pyramidal power structure.
[01:41:34.737 --> 01:41:35.237]  Mo, finish.
[01:41:35.637 --> 01:41:36.538]  It's a bullseye.
[01:41:36.558 --> 01:41:40.379]  It's just like when we talk about the Council of Foreign Relations or the Trilateralists.
[01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:43.781]  The overwhelming majority of members are clueless.
[01:41:43.961 --> 01:41:47.823]  It's only the inner circle who have any idea what the real goals are.
[01:41:48.243 --> 01:41:48.723]  Exactly.
[01:41:48.783 --> 01:41:49.503]  Mo, anything else?
[01:41:49.984 --> 01:41:50.364]  You bet.
[01:41:50.784 --> 01:41:53.565]  I know it's Mo because he's called before and now he's calling himself Newsstand.
[01:41:53.585 --> 01:41:53.925]  Go ahead.
[01:41:54.286 --> 01:41:58.147]  Well, just so you'll know, since we met at the Newsstand and talked about multimedia and
[01:42:00.310 --> 01:42:12.320]  Well, mentioning the obsession with numerology, the Hebrew mystics had something called gematria, which is the notion that God reveals supreme truths through alphanumerical correlations.
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:17.704]  And if you apply that to the English alphabet, and just say A is 1, B is 26, fill in the blanks,
[01:42:20.279 --> 01:42:30.782]  Strangely enough, sharing a value of 74 is Jesus, Lucifer, Occult Messiah, Tarot, Gospel, Joshua, English, Energy, Gematria.
[01:42:31.142 --> 01:42:32.662]  Now, I discovered that myself.
[01:42:32.902 --> 01:42:33.922]  There's a lot of weird stuff.
[01:42:33.962 --> 01:42:34.703]  Thanks for the call.
[01:42:35.703 --> 01:42:37.423]  And again, I've never even covered this.
[01:42:37.603 --> 01:42:41.204]  I just kept running into it every time I'd research the elite and what they're up to.
[01:42:41.584 --> 01:42:42.785]  I kept running into this.
[01:42:42.805 --> 01:42:44.345]  Have you experienced that, Raleigh?
[01:42:44.645 --> 01:43:10.548]  Absolutely, and you know, there's something else that's interesting, because these things go back forever and ever, and the very popular Kabbalah now, which all these stars are into and all that, the reality is the ancient Hebrews considered this knowledge so powerful that the only people who would even delve in it were the, you know, the ultimate Orthodox with like 40 years of training, and only then with a ton of protection,
[01:43:11.038 --> 01:43:20.184]  So whether you believe it or you don't, the reality is those who created it were very big on, look, the average person dabbles in it, it's going to get dark.
[01:43:20.545 --> 01:43:26.829]  You've got to have the spiritual perspective and protection to even talk about going there.
[01:43:26.949 --> 01:43:37.076]  Now, whether you believe it or you don't, or you think it's good or you don't, that lesson is completely lost, and now Madonna in six weeks is dabbling in God only knows what!
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:44.985]  It's crazy, I mean, Mark of the Beast, folks, and then these so-called Christian talk show hosts are going on the caps, too.
[01:43:45.045 --> 01:43:48.007]  National ID card is of the Lord.
[01:43:48.087 --> 01:43:49.608]  Bush is anointed.
[01:43:50.049 --> 01:43:51.650]  We've got to track everyone.
[01:43:51.730 --> 01:43:52.230]  It's good.
[01:43:52.270 --> 01:43:54.472]  I mean, they would never do that with Al Gore.
[01:43:55.052 --> 01:43:55.272]  Right.
[01:43:55.412 --> 01:43:57.253]  That's why Bush was the useful idiot.
[01:43:57.313 --> 01:43:59.174]  He had to be elected last time.
[01:43:59.414 --> 01:44:02.095]  Yeah, that's why I think he's back in, because he puts conservatives to sleep.
[01:44:02.115 --> 01:44:03.775]  We're not saying Kerry's good, folks.
[01:44:03.795 --> 01:44:04.795]  We'll talk about Kerry later.
[01:44:05.016 --> 01:44:07.676]  Gotta go quick now, because I'm taking forever as usual.
[01:44:08.397 --> 01:44:09.757]  Let's talk to Michael in Florida.
[01:44:09.797 --> 01:44:10.618]  Michael, you're on the air.
[01:44:10.638 --> 01:44:11.678]  Hi, Alex, Raleigh.
[01:44:11.698 --> 01:44:12.298]  How's everybody?
[01:44:12.318 --> 01:44:12.798]  Good.
[01:44:12.818 --> 01:44:13.398]  How are you?
[01:44:13.679 --> 01:44:14.119]  Oh, great.
[01:44:14.339 --> 01:44:14.639]  Great.
[01:44:15.259 --> 01:44:23.002]  Alex, the last time I called you on this show, my question to you was, hey, Alex, when is the next time you're going to be on Coast to Coast AM with
[01:44:23.803 --> 01:44:24.883]  With George Noory.
[01:44:25.543 --> 01:44:32.384]  Well, lo and behold, George Noory said last night that he's going to have Alex Jones back on the show.
[01:44:32.945 --> 01:44:34.305]  Now, which night is that going to be?
[01:44:34.325 --> 01:44:34.865]  Can you tell me?
[01:44:35.685 --> 01:44:41.546]  I'm on four hours, uh, election night or four hours the next night.
[01:44:41.586 --> 01:44:42.526]  Oh, another round table.
[01:44:42.666 --> 01:44:43.906]  Another round table, I bet.
[01:44:44.907 --> 01:44:46.707]  I think I may have been on two nights in a row.
[01:44:46.747 --> 01:44:47.147]  I don't know.
[01:44:47.167 --> 01:44:52.448]  You know, Raleigh, the best show Coast to Coast has ever had was the one with Alex Jones
[01:44:52.887 --> 01:44:57.291]  Linda Moulton Howe, Jim Maher, and Stephen Quayle.
[01:44:57.311 --> 01:45:01.174]  Well, I think the best show they ever had was when she was hosting it for a while.
[01:45:01.334 --> 01:45:01.534]  Oh, boy!
[01:45:01.614 --> 01:45:09.901]  No, well, it was wonderful to hear Alex on the show, and I'm so delighted that they're going in this direction.
[01:45:09.921 --> 01:45:20.329]  You know, on the one hand, you say, my God, you know, he's next to people who have just been implanted with alien chips, but on the other hand, if we're going to talk conspiracies,
[01:45:20.703 --> 01:45:24.306]  This is a wonderful way to bring this into the picture.
[01:45:24.346 --> 01:45:27.349]  I'm not going to turn down talking to 14 million people.
[01:45:27.529 --> 01:45:29.370]  Well, I'll tell you what was so powerful about that.
[01:45:29.390 --> 01:45:31.052]  They were talking about 9-1-1.
[01:45:31.392 --> 01:45:35.075]  They were talking about... And all four journalists were in agreement.
[01:45:35.095 --> 01:45:37.517]  9-1-1 was a sham.
[01:45:38.177 --> 01:45:45.964]  It was not... It was a real attack, but the people who they blamed were definitely not guilty of those crimes.
[01:45:47.351 --> 01:45:57.264]  Well, that's true for Oklahoma City, for Waco and all that, but the beauty of it is, and I agree with you, but I never get into, you know, was it created?
[01:45:57.685 --> 01:45:58.806]  None of that matters.
[01:45:58.907 --> 01:46:01.911]  What's fascinating to watch is whether it's created or not.
[01:46:03.288 --> 01:46:08.350]  Our government capitalizes on it faster than the speed of light.
[01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:11.531]  And does nothing to really protect us, leaves the borders wide open.
[01:46:11.771 --> 01:46:12.191]  Of course.
[01:46:12.211 --> 01:46:14.071]  I have one other thing for you, Alex.
[01:46:14.512 --> 01:46:17.693]  You're going to be on the show on Tuesday night, of course, everybody's going to be listening.
[01:46:18.493 --> 01:46:20.593]  George is too much of a gentleman to bring this up.
[01:46:20.874 --> 01:46:24.775]  Could you please ask him why this is not on the headlines?
[01:46:25.942 --> 01:46:32.365]  The President is being sued for $7 billion by 400 members of the 9-1-1 families.
[01:46:32.765 --> 01:46:34.126]  Why is that not news?
[01:46:34.506 --> 01:46:34.866]  I hear you.
[01:46:34.906 --> 01:46:35.566]  Thanks for the call.
[01:46:36.286 --> 01:46:37.547]  I appreciate it.
[01:46:37.647 --> 01:46:38.587]  Johnny in Canada.
[01:46:38.647 --> 01:46:39.508]  Johnny, you're on the air.
[01:46:39.548 --> 01:46:39.968]  Go ahead.
[01:46:39.988 --> 01:46:40.728]  Hi there.
[01:46:40.768 --> 01:46:41.169]  How's it going?
[01:46:41.369 --> 01:46:41.729]  Good, sir.
[01:46:42.729 --> 01:46:43.910]  I wanted to ask you a question.
[01:46:44.010 --> 01:46:49.132]  I saw this program on, I forgot what it was called, some channel, about the Anukai.
[01:46:49.853 --> 01:46:54.417]  And I just wanted to know what you and your thoughts were in regards to... I don't go there, sir.
[01:46:54.437 --> 01:46:54.917]  You don't?
[01:46:54.997 --> 01:46:57.019]  I just cover everything I can prove and document.
[01:46:57.619 --> 01:46:59.161]  You know, it's simple.
[01:46:59.661 --> 01:46:59.961]  Okay.
[01:47:01.543 --> 01:47:02.503]  Anything else on your mind?
[01:47:02.523 --> 01:47:03.304]  Pardon me?
[01:47:03.704 --> 01:47:04.885]  Anything else on your mind, sir?
[01:47:05.206 --> 01:47:12.131]  Um, this thing that your caller, the Sicilian caller was talking about, the evil eye.
[01:47:13.152 --> 01:47:16.595]  It actually has nothing, because I'm Italian myself, it has nothing to do with
[01:47:18.394 --> 01:47:22.395]  That's not what the caller was saying.
[01:47:22.435 --> 01:47:25.997]  I mean, for some reason, some day, certain themes come up, even if I don't bring them up.
[01:47:26.377 --> 01:47:29.699]  A caller talked about the new Frost making awesome, looking like a giant owl.
[01:47:30.379 --> 01:47:38.022]  And then he said, by the way, I'm Sicilian, and you know, the horn sign that Bush makes, and all the other presidents make, has nothing to do with UT football.
[01:47:38.142 --> 01:47:39.683]  You know, in Sicilian, that's a curse.
[01:47:39.703 --> 01:47:40.744]  So that's what he was saying.
[01:47:41.224 --> 01:47:41.524]  Oh, okay.
[01:47:42.284 --> 01:47:42.724]  Okay, cool.
[01:47:42.824 --> 01:47:43.145]  Keep it up.
[01:47:43.425 --> 01:47:44.325]  Thank you for the call.
[01:47:44.645 --> 01:47:45.686]  Let's take another one here.
[01:47:46.647 --> 01:47:50.430]  Anybody want to talk about the National ID Card, the upcoming election, hate crimes laws here?
[01:47:51.111 --> 01:47:52.792]  Let's talk to David in Minnesota.
[01:47:52.832 --> 01:47:53.573]  David, you're on the air.
[01:47:53.613 --> 01:47:53.993]  Go ahead.
[01:47:54.013 --> 01:47:58.337]  Hey Alex, I want to thank you and your guests for the wonderful work you put forth.
[01:47:58.357 --> 01:47:59.458]  It's much appreciated.
[01:47:59.478 --> 01:48:00.759]  Thank you.
[01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:11.228]  But, yeah, John Kerry was in Minneapolis last week, and had I known, I found out the day he came, I would have made videos, you know, the 9-11 video you did.
[01:48:11.909 --> 01:48:18.151]  I would have handed them out, but at the last minute I handed out a bunch of deception dollars, so hopefully that'll reap some benefits.
[01:48:19.792 --> 01:48:20.312]  Well, good!
[01:48:22.113 --> 01:48:33.777]  One thing I wanted to bring up, about six years ago, Jim Carrey was on Oprah Winfrey, and at one point they got up and they were saying, you know, I am the Illuminati!
[01:48:33.797 --> 01:48:35.458]  I am the Illuminati!
[01:48:36.098 --> 01:48:37.298]  And it was really bizarre.
[01:48:37.318 --> 01:48:38.859]  It was really out of context.
[01:48:39.588 --> 01:48:41.850]  With anything that the show is pushing?
[01:48:41.870 --> 01:48:43.631]  Have you ever heard of that?
[01:48:44.271 --> 01:48:46.193]  No, I haven't heard of that, but they do lots of this.
[01:48:46.273 --> 01:48:58.042]  I mean, you'll be, unless you're sending me videos off of Saving Amy or NYPD Blue or just any of these shows, and just in the middle they'll go, in Friends, we've played the clip, they go, it's the New World Order, get used to it.
[01:48:58.662 --> 01:48:59.843]  You know, they just hook
[01:49:00.504 --> 01:49:03.366]  Raleigh, have you seen how they just insert these statements all over the place?
[01:49:03.827 --> 01:49:12.856]  Yeah, again, I think it's to desensitize it and make those of us who are describing what's going on just truly be the lunatic fringe.
[01:49:12.936 --> 01:49:23.887]  There was one of those movies I was watching, and I'm not good at remembering names of that, but I almost gasped when I saw the central player, who was supposed to be this, you know, deluded psycho,
[01:49:24.572 --> 01:49:28.414]  You go to his apartment and there's the New American there.
[01:49:29.594 --> 01:49:40.039]  All the publications that we might read are just laid out to just further entrench the viewer into believing that only somebody half out of his mind would consider this accurate.
[01:49:41.199 --> 01:49:41.499]  Alex?
[01:49:41.719 --> 01:49:41.980]  Yes?
[01:49:42.660 --> 01:49:45.941]  Have you considered having Michael A. Hoffman II on your program?
[01:49:46.702 --> 01:49:47.462]  I might do that.
[01:49:47.762 --> 01:49:48.602]  I appreciate the call.
[01:49:48.662 --> 01:49:51.124]  We'll be back to get into more news and take your calls.
[01:49:51.524 --> 01:49:52.024]  Stay with us.
[01:49:53.402 --> 01:50:00.244]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:00.544 --> 01:50:01.924]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.124 --> 01:50:04.325]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.465 --> 01:50:06.565]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:06.846 --> 01:50:11.787]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.107 --> 01:50:16.148]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.388 --> 01:50:18.170]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.250 --> 01:50:28.902]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.062 --> 01:50:30.925]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:31.305 --> 01:50:34.988]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns in the Info Wars.
[01:50:35.109 --> 01:50:36.670]  Order right now by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:36.690 --> 01:50:37.070]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:37.090 --> 01:50:39.493]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[01:50:39.513 --> 01:50:40.774]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[01:50:52.603 --> 01:51:00.108]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:51:00.388 --> 01:51:11.316]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:51:11.516 --> 01:51:11.716]  I think?
[01:51:11.736 --> 01:51:11.956]  I think?

[01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:06.521]  R-O-L-L-Y-E.net.
[01:53:06.901 --> 01:53:08.442]  She's on XM Radio.
[01:53:08.562 --> 01:53:09.243]  Very exciting.
[01:53:09.263 --> 01:53:10.764]  And a lot of big AM and FM stations.
[01:53:11.539 --> 01:53:14.201]  Dotting of the countryside across this fine land.
[01:53:14.782 --> 01:53:17.183]  I want to get into the election and her prediction specifically.
[01:53:17.223 --> 01:53:20.666]  We're going to have those riots and talk more about the candidates.
[01:53:20.686 --> 01:53:24.809]  I also want to, again, get into the National ID Card and the new Super Patriot Act.
[01:53:25.289 --> 01:53:28.432]  But, Raleigh, we have the case of this Snellgrove girl.
[01:53:29.315 --> 01:53:56.387]  out there getting shot with one of these rubber bullets and I have their own training manuals it says don't shoot these any closer than 60 feet they shot her reportedly at 20 feet and then they made excuses that well it's the rioters fault but now we learn the riots started when cops tried to clear the streets of revelers and she was in an area where that wasn't even happening where we're not even a trash can or you know anything was overturned what do you think about this tragic situation?
[01:53:56.980 --> 01:53:59.901]  We're seeing this all over the place, and it's just the beginning.
[01:54:00.181 --> 01:54:05.824]  I mean, as you're pointing out, the fascinating thing is that let's blame the victim.
[01:54:06.184 --> 01:54:17.889]  Let's find a way to make anybody who is attacked by the government, either verbally or physically in this kind of case, at fault because of their own actions.
[01:54:19.793 --> 01:54:31.463]  And then the media, deftly, and they do this on every big issue, made it an issue of, they put our picture in the newspaper, and then that became the focus of Bostonites' rage.
[01:54:31.483 --> 01:54:32.584]  It wasn't at the police.
[01:54:33.348 --> 01:54:34.929]  But was it this murder photo?
[01:54:35.009 --> 01:54:39.370]  I mean, in the thirties and forties, that was the only violence you could get away with showing, not in film.
[01:54:39.390 --> 01:54:42.191]  You couldn't even show blood dripping out of the corner of somebody's mouth.
[01:54:42.211 --> 01:54:43.792]  You couldn't even show somebody getting shot, really.
[01:54:44.192 --> 01:54:48.154]  But you could show the most brutal crime scene photos on the paper, because that was real.
[01:54:48.214 --> 01:54:48.854]  That was news.
[01:54:49.114 --> 01:54:49.914]  Now it's the opposite.
[01:54:49.934 --> 01:54:55.817]  We can handle the most violent, decadent garbage on TV and in movies, but don't show me something that's real.
[01:54:56.517 --> 01:54:57.157]  Absolutely.
[01:54:57.657 --> 01:55:01.639]  And we started to see that when we wouldn't print pictures of
[01:55:02.735 --> 01:55:06.440]  of suspects if they happen to be people of color.
[01:55:06.901 --> 01:55:07.982]  Things of that nature.
[01:55:08.042 --> 01:55:10.465]  Then it went to, well, we just won't print them at all.
[01:55:10.645 --> 01:55:11.707]  And now you're right.
[01:55:11.827 --> 01:55:18.795]  What was commonplace in the newspapers, forbidden, but don't turn on the television during, you know, prime time shows.
[01:55:19.456 --> 01:55:19.957]  Absolutely.
[01:55:21.334 --> 01:55:24.935]  Yeah, but the government doesn't have to propagandize too much.
[01:55:25.015 --> 01:55:26.336]  People want to be in denial.
[01:55:26.376 --> 01:55:29.177]  They want to run away from something that's scary.
[01:55:29.217 --> 01:55:31.178]  Well, there's a very big benefit in that.
[01:55:31.298 --> 01:55:39.601]  As you well know, Alex, people are dying to believe that things are fine, no pun intended, because then they don't have to be involved.
[01:55:40.001 --> 01:55:42.542]  If everything's okay, they don't have to worry about it.
[01:55:42.602 --> 01:55:45.023]  The seven-second sound bite's all they need.
[01:55:45.383 --> 01:55:49.245]  If they actually are willing to look at it and say, we've got a problem here,
[01:55:49.781 --> 01:55:53.223]  They've got a problem because now they've got to become involved.
[01:55:53.643 --> 01:55:54.923]  And they don't want to be involved.
[01:55:55.244 --> 01:55:56.364]  Well, folks, don't get me wrong.
[01:55:56.444 --> 01:55:57.265]  I don't hate sports.
[01:55:57.345 --> 01:55:58.105]  I've played sports.
[01:55:58.185 --> 01:56:09.170]  But when it's your life, when you cry, you yell, you scream over your team, but then your neighbor's rights are violated or your rights are violated, you don't get upset or you don't care about your Bill of Rights being flushed down the toilet.
[01:56:09.430 --> 01:56:14.993]  You know all the baseball statistics going back a decade, but you don't know what the Fourth Amendment is and say you can't learn it.
[01:56:15.569 --> 01:56:16.530]  You know, that's a problem.
[01:56:16.570 --> 01:56:18.351]  But see, people want to bet on a winner.
[01:56:18.731 --> 01:56:20.232]  They want a winner in their life.
[01:56:20.472 --> 01:56:22.153]  Their job is being shipped to China.
[01:56:22.493 --> 01:56:23.814]  Their kids are on drugs.
[01:56:24.174 --> 01:56:25.855]  They want a winner in their life.
[01:56:25.895 --> 01:56:26.775]  They want an escape.
[01:56:26.815 --> 01:56:29.357]  They want to associate themselves with a winner.
[01:56:30.137 --> 01:56:32.538]  And so that's why they make sports their god.
[01:56:32.558 --> 01:56:33.859]  And I say that's mental illness.
[01:56:34.199 --> 01:56:35.340]  That is truly sick.
[01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:38.641]  And that completes your journey to enslavement.
[01:56:38.741 --> 01:56:41.102]  The slaves had the gladiatorial events in Rome.
[01:56:41.562 --> 01:56:47.984]  The globalists, the controllers, the social architects, engineers, know exactly what they're doing.
[01:56:49.024 --> 01:56:50.484]  What's your take on what I just said there?
[01:56:50.804 --> 01:56:51.204]  Absolutely.
[01:56:51.244 --> 01:56:52.705]  Human nature has not changed.
[01:56:52.725 --> 01:56:55.326]  It's the one constant from the time of Plato to now.
[01:56:55.826 --> 01:57:03.828]  And so as long as someone's a student of human nature and understands the effect of denial and why people engage in it, they've got it.
[01:57:06.189 --> 01:57:13.734]  I mean, I know people that'll yell and scream at a football game, and that's normal, but if I went out and yelled and screamed on the street, I'd be a weirdo about my Bill of Rights.
[01:57:14.014 --> 01:57:22.179]  Well, because when you do that, again, it's not like a football game where you can say, yeah, well, let's watch the next game or whatever, pass the popcorn.
[01:57:22.239 --> 01:57:24.921]  I mean, what you're saying is truly so profound.
[01:57:25.021 --> 01:57:29.624]  If someone buys into this, they cannot continue with their complacency.
[01:57:29.984 --> 01:57:35.488]  Now they've got to do something, and they don't have the time or the inclination, so it's easier to call you a wacko.
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:37.641]  Alright, it's Raleigh James.
[01:57:37.701 --> 01:57:38.601]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:57:38.801 --> 01:57:39.782]  RaleighJames.net.
[01:57:39.862 --> 01:57:41.403]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[01:57:43.624 --> 01:57:43.944]  Hello!
[01:57:49.748 --> 01:57:50.388]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.408 --> 01:57:52.029]  Mainstream Media.
[01:57:52.819 --> 01:57:53.900]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.580 --> 01:57:55.441]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.141 --> 01:57:57.081]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.722 --> 01:58:01.364]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.904 --> 01:58:06.026]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.668 --> 01:58:16.132]  Third hour, my friends, your call's coming up as we talk to syndicated radio broadcaster, also on XM Radio as well, Raleigh James.
[01:58:16.152 --> 01:58:18.513]  The website raleigh.net, her name, Raleigh James.
[01:58:19.154 --> 01:58:19.854]  I'm saying Raleigh.
[01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:21.621]  James got in earlier.
[01:58:22.681 --> 01:58:30.146]  She joins us here in the third hour, and for those that are just joining us, we're talking about just the whole spectrum of news and what's happening.
[01:58:30.187 --> 01:58:31.267]  I want to state this again.
[01:58:33.349 --> 01:58:47.058]  Regardless of who is elected, on the morning of November 3rd, both the candidates are cousins, skull and bones, they're for open borders, gun control, UNESCO in the UN, they're for the war, they're for going into Syria and Iran,
[01:58:49.036 --> 01:58:50.517]  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
[01:58:50.637 --> 01:58:52.218]  I predict George Bush, so does Raleigh.
[01:58:52.858 --> 01:59:01.082]  And unfortunately, I predict it's going to be a disputed election, at least for a few days, and that you're going to see some serious rioting in this nation, which will give them even more of a pretext to clamp down.
[01:59:01.742 --> 01:59:04.183]  The worse things get, the more control they get.
[01:59:04.223 --> 01:59:04.643]  They love it!
[01:59:05.304 --> 01:59:12.807]  Raleigh James, what chance do you think we have of seeing riots in this nation if the election is disputed?
[01:59:13.718 --> 01:59:16.640]  I think it's pretty good, actually, as far as that goes.
[01:59:16.700 --> 01:59:38.652]  Now, the interesting thing about Kerry, and you're right, they are the same, and I love that one skull, one's bones, and it's so true, but when you look at his record and also when you look at his persona, because he is an arrogant elitist, no matter how you spell it, they had to look far and wide to find someone so far to the left and so arrogant
[01:59:39.093 --> 01:59:41.374]  So as to give Bush the edge.
[01:59:41.474 --> 01:59:44.596]  Because frankly, a lot of people in this country were upset with Bush.
[01:59:44.696 --> 01:59:51.920]  And I was stunned that they could find someone so out of the mainstream to run against him.
[01:59:52.300 --> 01:59:53.941]  That had to be by design.
[01:59:55.041 --> 01:59:59.043]  Well, we know that Bob Dole rolled over for Bill Clinton.
[01:59:59.924 --> 02:00:01.044]  I mean, this stuff's been going on.
[02:00:01.084 --> 02:00:05.227]  I mean, they basically ran a mummy against him.
[02:00:07.785 --> 02:00:09.166]  Right, so here we are.
[02:00:09.487 --> 02:00:10.748]  It's the same thing over and over again.
[02:00:10.788 --> 02:00:15.132]  So, you know what, I say then, why don't we focus on the local and county and state elections?
[02:00:15.433 --> 02:00:19.537]  That's where the real power's at if we take back our Tenth Amendment and tell the feds to take a hike.
[02:00:20.017 --> 02:00:21.379]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:00:21.559 --> 02:00:29.627]  And you know, it's so unfortunate that in a midterm election almost nobody shows up and very few people know who their state representative is.
[02:00:30.034 --> 02:00:37.960]  But not only is the power there for them locally, but also those are the guys who tomorrow will escalate to the presidency.
[02:00:38.040 --> 02:00:44.665]  So, that's a great place to get independents and thirds into office, and it can be done.
[02:00:44.685 --> 02:00:50.170]  Yeah, if people were involved more locally, take a normal local election in Austin.
[02:00:50.670 --> 02:00:52.632]  Eight percent turnout, on average.
[02:00:52.912 --> 02:00:55.574]  Well, of course, there are no normal elections in Austin.
[02:00:57.215 --> 02:00:57.996]  Boy, you said it.
[02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:08.370]  Well, overall, the final question you had for me on your broadcast last week was, can it be fixed?
[02:01:09.110 --> 02:01:11.393]  And I think both it can't and it can.
[02:01:11.433 --> 02:01:13.216]  I mean, we're going to go through this process.
[02:01:13.928 --> 02:01:19.711]  You know, the question is what comes out of the process, more enslavement or a renaissance against this tyranny?
[02:01:19.951 --> 02:01:27.295]  And I see the renaissance taking place, but they're so good at centralizing the debate that people who are waking up feel like they're the only ones.
[02:01:27.615 --> 02:01:33.138]  While I'm actually out there talking to the public, Raleigh, I don't know really anybody who isn't waking up unless they work for the government.
[02:01:34.378 --> 02:01:41.302]  That's very true, but I will say there's another group of people, the dedicated socialists, if you will,
[02:01:41.704 --> 02:01:53.392]  Who absolutely believe in control because in their heart of hearts, they believe that we are not capable of guiding our own life and that we need to be protected from one another.
[02:01:53.792 --> 02:01:58.996]  And I think that that is a disturbingly growing group of people at the same time.
[02:01:59.016 --> 02:02:00.156]  So it's like a pendulum.
[02:02:00.457 --> 02:02:04.759]  There's people on our side who are saying, you know, get out of my life, leave me alone.
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:07.481]  And there's others who are welcoming this.
[02:02:07.862 --> 02:02:09.082]  And you see this all the time.
[02:02:09.142 --> 02:02:09.923]  And of course, the news
[02:02:10.365 --> 02:02:13.508]  So it's two different worlds co-residing together at the same time.
[02:02:13.608 --> 02:02:13.948]  Sure it is.
[02:02:31.505 --> 02:02:32.305]  Sure it is.
[02:02:32.465 --> 02:02:33.986]  And they're counting on that, too.
[02:02:34.546 --> 02:02:42.450]  And, you know, what's fascinating to me, and you hear them all the time, too, is how anybody with a straight face would have created an on-star commercial.
[02:02:47.702 --> 02:02:53.185]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:53.605 --> 02:02:57.847]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:02:58.087 --> 02:03:05.110]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:05.490 --> 02:03:11.613]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:11.753 --> 02:03:12.974]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:13.294 --> 02:03:16.257]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:03:16.397 --> 02:03:18.439]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:03:18.739 --> 02:03:25.965]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:03:26.266 --> 02:03:29.689]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[02:04:20.026 --> 02:04:23.929]  The Berculite is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.

[02:05:10.851 --> 02:05:15.496]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:05:15.576 --> 02:05:21.843]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:05:21.903 --> 02:05:23.705]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:05:41.929 --> 02:05:44.070]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:05:49.811 --> 02:05:50.472]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.132 --> 02:05:52.112]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:52.891 --> 02:05:53.972]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.632 --> 02:05:55.493]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.233 --> 02:05:57.173]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.193 --> 02:06:01.576]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.976 --> 02:06:06.098]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.179 --> 02:06:14.363]  Raleigh James, a very serious, but also very informed broadcaster.
[02:06:14.803 --> 02:06:17.544]  Taught me a lot when she was on locally here in Austin many years ago.
[02:06:18.045 --> 02:06:20.346]  Syndicated broadcast, XM radio, you name it.
[02:06:21.306 --> 02:06:25.708]  Raleigh.net, Raleigh with two L's, R-O-L-L-Y-E dot net.
[02:06:26.228 --> 02:06:28.468]  She's going to be with us for another 30 minutes or so.
[02:06:28.628 --> 02:06:29.809]  I'll try to keep her the whole time.
[02:06:29.889 --> 02:06:31.990]  I'm enjoying her riding shotgun with us today.
[02:06:32.430 --> 02:06:41.833]  Yes, we'll go to Malta and Denmark and Brock and Rhode Island and Tim and New Haven, Connecticut and everybody else that is patiently holding there.
[02:06:42.682 --> 02:06:43.844]  And again, the number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:44.044 --> 02:06:49.954]  But, Raleigh, you know, this line we hear from Republicans and Democrats.
[02:06:50.315 --> 02:06:51.597]  You were getting at this with OnStar.
[02:06:52.341 --> 02:06:53.922]  Give up liberty, you get security.
[02:06:54.402 --> 02:06:55.743]  Give up liberty, you get security.
[02:06:55.923 --> 02:06:58.265]  Before 9-11, the terrorists are going to attack.
[02:06:58.665 --> 02:06:59.706]  Not a question of it, but when.
[02:06:59.726 --> 02:07:02.027]  And when they attack, give your rights up, you'll be safe.
[02:07:02.528 --> 02:07:08.031]  It was like Jim Jones having his cult followers drilling with Kool-Aid every day until the real thing happens.
[02:07:08.492 --> 02:07:09.172]  You know, training us.
[02:07:09.232 --> 02:07:10.893]  So when it happened, give up your rights!
[02:07:10.933 --> 02:07:12.414]  Within two hours, it's bin Laden!
[02:07:12.434 --> 02:07:13.195]  Give up your rights!
[02:07:13.275 --> 02:07:13.915]  Run for the hills!
[02:07:13.955 --> 02:07:14.615]  Give up your rights!
[02:07:14.916 --> 02:07:16.777]  The men in black ski masks will keep you safe!
[02:07:17.640 --> 02:07:23.561]  So, bottom line, they got double funding after Oklahoma, and they got now triple plus funding after this.
[02:07:23.821 --> 02:07:29.683]  Is there incentive to stop the attacks, or is there an incentive to actually go out and fund them?
[02:07:29.703 --> 02:07:34.064]  And then we talk about, well, I mean, you were talking about this on your own broadcast.
[02:07:34.084 --> 02:07:36.344]  I mean, giving up your liberty doesn't give you security, does it?
[02:07:36.824 --> 02:07:40.485]  It guarantees not to, and of course, that was Franklin's famous quote.
[02:07:40.605 --> 02:07:44.766]  You know, a man who gives up his liberty for security deserves neither.
[02:07:45.467 --> 02:07:52.609]  And it's a fine deal to make, the only problem with it is it's not possible to make it.
[02:07:52.729 --> 02:08:05.391]  But you've got throngs of people, particularly the soccer moms, the children moms, and they will absolutely give up anything if they perceive their child is safer.
[02:08:05.711 --> 02:08:09.172]  You know, there would almost be a debate if it were possible.
[02:08:09.693 --> 02:08:15.895]  But the problem is that giving up your liberty has never, and will never, get you security.
[02:08:16.115 --> 02:08:26.839]  Well, it ensures that, you know, let's say we had an angelic government, as you said last hour, you've built the mechanisms, the levers of despotism, they will be used, it's only a question of when.
[02:08:27.099 --> 02:08:28.340]  Of course, of course.
[02:08:28.540 --> 02:08:33.402]  And, you know, we were talking a few minutes ago about people's reactions.
[02:08:34.062 --> 02:08:44.305]  You know, very often I love to think that, well, if everybody was aware of the things that we are talking about, they would see the light and, you know, act accordingly.
[02:08:44.665 --> 02:08:48.306]  But the reality is that's really not true any longer.
[02:08:48.426 --> 02:08:54.368]  For instance, those who are dedicated socialists who are saying they want government health care.
[02:08:54.408 --> 02:08:58.349]  Well, you and I know that it's not about the cost, it's about the choice.
[02:08:58.649 --> 02:09:01.690]  You know, we don't want to give up our destiny to choose.
[02:09:01.830 --> 02:09:02.070]  Well,
[02:09:02.495 --> 02:09:07.859]  Sadly, there are many people who are saying, well, I don't care if I have free choice.
[02:09:07.900 --> 02:09:09.401]  The government knows better than me.
[02:09:09.561 --> 02:09:11.222]  I just want to be taken care of.
[02:09:11.703 --> 02:09:17.988]  So you've got individuals who are willing to say, well, I don't care if I have these rights and these freedoms.
[02:09:18.582 --> 02:09:19.963]  I want to be taken care of.
[02:09:20.023 --> 02:09:21.563]  I want to be a domesticated cow.
[02:09:21.923 --> 02:09:23.684]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:09:23.724 --> 02:09:26.125]  But the problem is they go, England's so great.
[02:09:26.205 --> 02:09:40.651]  Oh yeah, I have an employee that works for me, running PrisonPlanet.com and TV, lives in England, and Tony Blair admitted in the House of Commons a few months ago that it is a 14-month wait for cancer surgery for terminal cancer that kills you in six weeks.
[02:09:40.971 --> 02:09:46.975]  Well, my favorite was, or least favorite I should say, when Paul McCartney met his wife and they talked about all the land mines and all that.
[02:09:59.471 --> 02:10:07.240]  The woman who got up to speak there, who was missing four, count them, four of her limbs, that's all of them, had meningitis.
[02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:17.831]  And the reason she lost her limbs was because there was a health care strike and she couldn't get in to be treated until the point that all four of her limbs had to be removed.
[02:10:17.952 --> 02:10:19.994]  But they acted like it was from landmines.
[02:10:20.254 --> 02:10:22.617]  Well, they didn't so much act like that.
[02:10:22.637 --> 02:10:23.878]  They just put her up there.
[02:10:23.938 --> 02:10:38.373]  Yeah, she was up there with the landmine victims, but to me, this is not about anything except let's talk about the results of healthcare, and no one brought this up at any point in any of the press releases I saw, and of course you can ask
[02:10:39.089 --> 02:10:41.210]  The Canadians as well, many of them.
[02:10:41.490 --> 02:10:44.911]  They'll tell you what it's like in terms... Well, I mean, I have a lot of British listeners.
[02:10:44.971 --> 02:10:46.291]  I do a lot of British radio.
[02:10:46.411 --> 02:10:47.752]  I'm a guest on a lot of their shows.
[02:10:48.012 --> 02:10:49.292]  They hate their system.
[02:10:49.912 --> 02:10:54.394]  When they got money, they fly here or they fly... Canadians come down here for their health care.
[02:10:54.694 --> 02:11:04.217]  Well, yes, the Canadians absolutely come here, but regarding the British or the Australians or something, the reality is if they have money, they're treated privately in their own
[02:11:04.637 --> 02:11:14.021]  So what's really going on is a bigger class has been created between the have and have nots by this system that's supposed to eliminate it.
[02:11:14.081 --> 02:11:20.404]  And what's made health care so expensive is the corporate socialism involved where they socialized to guarantee their profits.
[02:11:20.944 --> 02:11:29.948]  They socialized our care and then, but fasciatized, a new word I just invented, I'm George Bush, fasciatized the profits.
[02:11:30.563 --> 02:11:32.385]  Yes, that's all true.
[02:11:32.505 --> 02:11:42.775]  And of course the cost shifting between what they've got to pay out for a Medicaid or Medicare procedure versus what it costs them, well they pass it along to the insurance companies who then
[02:11:43.257 --> 02:11:51.524]  Make deals for preferential prices and the only person in America paying full price for health care is the uninsured.
[02:11:51.604 --> 02:11:52.485]  Let me tell you a story.
[02:11:52.505 --> 02:11:53.486]  Let me tell you a story.
[02:11:53.526 --> 02:12:01.413]  My dad is a dentist oral surgeon but what he really does now over the years and he just got into it because he ran some successful dental offices.
[02:12:02.854 --> 02:12:08.779]  He consults for now not just medical but medical as well as dental.
[02:12:09.452 --> 02:12:21.882]  And he says that the insurance companies come in and they pay off whole groups, and this is what he fights against, because it actually isn't good for profits long-term, it isn't good for the doctors, the patients, anybody, and it of course screws the doctors too.
[02:12:22.702 --> 02:12:24.664]  They come in and they pay them off.
[02:12:24.684 --> 02:12:31.129]  They go, here's a giant contract, take all of our cases, but we don't want you to really give people care, just do the absolute minimum.
[02:12:31.449 --> 02:12:33.631]  And you know, we all hear this about HMOs, folks.
[02:12:33.931 --> 02:12:36.013]  This is actually what goes on in these boardrooms.
[02:12:36.053 --> 02:12:36.333]  Go ahead.
[02:12:37.054 --> 02:12:38.095]  That's 100% true.
[02:12:38.295 --> 02:12:42.859]  I always say with HMO, take veterinary medicine, stand in line behind the cow, you'll be treated better.
[02:12:42.879 --> 02:12:49.084]  HMOs are fine as long as people know what they are and no one seems to.
[02:12:49.204 --> 02:12:50.846]  People want something for nothing.
[02:12:50.906 --> 02:13:01.555]  The reality is it's managed care and the goal is to save money by withholding treatment and people are being rewarded financially for the withhold.
[02:13:02.962 --> 02:13:05.624]  Well, we put too many middlemen involved in healthcare.
[02:13:06.484 --> 02:13:11.926]  And so they've got all their profits, and then their profits are designed to not have a free market system.
[02:13:12.206 --> 02:13:14.668]  Raleigh, you keep mentioning OnStar, which disgusts me.
[02:13:14.928 --> 02:13:15.488]  Help me!
[02:13:15.508 --> 02:13:17.129]  I don't know how to open it!
[02:13:17.409 --> 02:13:17.889]  Save me!
[02:13:18.149 --> 02:13:19.490]  Yes, ma'am, we'll do that for you.
[02:13:19.810 --> 02:13:22.471]  Here's a piece that Michael Corbin put together.
[02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:28.242]  Called Neocon Star about a year ago, and we haven't played this in a few months.
[02:13:28.662 --> 02:13:32.963]  I think you're going to get a big kick out of this, so take a listen to this.
[02:13:33.003 --> 02:13:34.443]  Here's Neocon Star, folks.
[02:13:36.444 --> 02:13:39.985]  Neocon Star, how can I offer you great service today?
[02:13:40.185 --> 02:13:42.466]  Please help me, I'm trapped in my car!
[02:13:42.526 --> 02:13:44.427]  My retina scanner won't work!
[02:13:44.627 --> 02:13:45.747]  Just relax, sir.
[02:13:45.887 --> 02:13:47.608]  It's not sir, it's ma'am!
[02:13:47.688 --> 02:13:49.428]  Please hurry, it's hot in here!
[02:13:49.628 --> 02:13:52.329]  According to Admiral Poindexter's database, I have you
[02:13:59.621 --> 02:14:00.842]  I'm an old lady.
[02:14:01.102 --> 02:14:02.323]  But I can't find it.
[02:14:02.363 --> 02:14:03.244]  I'm looking everywhere.
[02:14:03.264 --> 02:14:04.445]  I can't find my national ID card.
[02:14:37.131 --> 02:14:37.652]  Okay.
[02:14:38.213 --> 02:14:40.195]  I'll take the lethal injection, please.
[02:14:40.536 --> 02:14:42.819]  Thanks for using Neocon Star.
[02:14:43.139 --> 02:14:43.960]  Have a nice day.
[02:14:44.521 --> 02:14:45.002]  Alright.
[02:14:45.823 --> 02:14:47.645]  So there's that piece, and...
[02:14:48.774 --> 02:14:50.535]  Again, that was a year and a half ago.
[02:14:51.216 --> 02:14:52.456]  We knew about the plans for the blimps.
[02:14:52.497 --> 02:14:53.657]  They were over us in D.C.
[02:14:53.717 --> 02:14:56.299]  Now there's one over D.C.
[02:14:56.399 --> 02:14:57.119]  and New York.
[02:14:58.180 --> 02:14:59.240]  Toyota's coming out with a car.
[02:14:59.261 --> 02:15:01.582]  You've got to swipe your card through so it'll start.
[02:15:02.142 --> 02:15:04.884]  They say you'll have to have this car to have jobs anywhere.
[02:15:05.244 --> 02:15:06.205]  This is all happening.
[02:15:06.245 --> 02:15:09.807]  I mean, that's dark satire, but we're only a few years away.
[02:15:10.267 --> 02:15:14.830]  And China actually has 24 mobile execution vans with automatic
[02:15:15.690 --> 02:15:18.332]  Absolutely.
[02:15:18.352 --> 02:15:23.176]  That was great, by the way.
[02:15:23.516 --> 02:15:24.037]  I loved it.
[02:15:26.579 --> 02:15:34.785]  Just the fact that the OnStar spots run as they do, and you've got a number of people who are saying, oh, that's great!
[02:15:35.005 --> 02:15:36.006]  Let me order it!
[02:15:36.427 --> 02:15:38.008]  Tells you everything you need to know.
[02:15:38.775 --> 02:15:41.518]  But now they're saying, we're just going to make it standard, you'll have to have it.
[02:15:42.039 --> 02:15:51.269]  And then on top of that, they got caught, what, a year ago using OnStar to listen to people, because the government's tied through that, and it's an audio cell phone in your car.
[02:15:51.609 --> 02:15:58.377]  Well, the best part about this is, again, the only reason we know that is the Ninth Court of Appeals ruled against it in San Francisco.
[02:15:59.073 --> 02:16:03.914]  Again, the reason that they did was not because anybody was spying on you in your car.
[02:16:04.294 --> 02:16:12.197]  It's simply because when they were spying on you, it interfered with your ability to use OnStar as directive.
[02:16:12.717 --> 02:16:17.798]  And what the court basically said is if they could find a way to spy without it interfering with that, then they don't have a problem.
[02:16:17.818 --> 02:16:20.079]  Yeah, no more Fifth Amendment.
[02:16:20.119 --> 02:16:21.219]  Fourth Amendment.
[02:16:21.747 --> 02:16:30.155]  I was aghast at this, and you're right that it will not be voluntary, and already even people with OnStar are finding out it's not voluntary.
[02:16:30.215 --> 02:16:37.221]  If you decide to stop paying, they'll cut off your services, but they won't remove OnStar or cut off their ability to listen.
[02:16:39.944 --> 02:16:42.406]  Folks, are you starting to get the bigger picture?
[02:16:42.646 --> 02:16:47.530]  Of course, in 96 they passed a law that all cell phones had to be satellite triangulated by the towers down to 15 feet,
[02:16:48.621 --> 02:16:51.044]  Well, they also don't realize that when the phone is off, it's still transmitting location.
[02:17:07.469 --> 02:17:08.670]  Oh, what's the name of the holiday?
[02:17:08.710 --> 02:17:09.291]  Thanksgiving?
[02:17:09.511 --> 02:17:18.499]  That they made all of them take the batteries off their cell phones and put them in a bag, and they said, no, it's not so you can't call, it's so nobody can listen to us.
[02:17:19.940 --> 02:17:22.923]  Right, but the new phones, you can even take the batteries off.
[02:17:24.246 --> 02:17:27.687]  It's all part of the new freedom, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:28.167 --> 02:17:30.788]  More Orwellian than Orwell's nightmare vision.
[02:17:31.089 --> 02:17:33.689]  We'll talk to Malta and Denmark, Brooklyn, Rhode Island and others.
[02:17:34.050 --> 02:17:39.752]  On the other side with Raleigh James on a lot of other key news as we accelerate towards election 2004.
[02:17:39.792 --> 02:17:40.892]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:17:47.122 --> 02:17:48.143]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:17:48.483 --> 02:17:51.265]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:17:51.525 --> 02:17:55.688]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:17:56.109 --> 02:17:56.949]  So what do you do?
[02:17:57.249 --> 02:18:01.833]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:18:02.313 --> 02:18:04.435]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:18:04.935 --> 02:18:19.648]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:18:44.983 --> 02:18:45.403]  Gold.
[02:18:45.763 --> 02:18:47.064]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:18:47.304 --> 02:18:53.387]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:18:53.588 --> 02:18:57.410]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:18:57.750 --> 02:18:59.651]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:18:59.691 --> 02:19:01.992]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:19:02.132 --> 02:19:07.875]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency.
[02:19:07.975 --> 02:19:08.375]  We're good to go.
[02:19:27.346 --> 02:19:27.566]  We're good.
[02:19:44.324 --> 02:19:46.806]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I've got a gripe.
[02:19:47.187 --> 02:19:50.129]  Recently, construction in my area has doubled my commute time.
[02:19:50.270 --> 02:19:53.933]  I'm spending up to four hours in stop-and-go rush hour traffic every day.
[02:19:54.113 --> 02:19:56.555]  The worst part is there's no good talk radio to listen to.
[02:19:56.715 --> 02:19:59.958]  But that doesn't matter to me anymore, thanks to the good people at Freeway Radio.
[02:20:00.138 --> 02:20:07.485]  I've got the Sony shortwave car stereo from Freeway Radio, and now I look forward to getting comfortable in my car and hearing the real scoop on the day's news.
[02:20:07.705 --> 02:20:09.406]  It's not just a shortwave radio, though.

[02:20:31.645 --> 02:20:36.712]  Don't get me wrong, I'd still rather be golfing than sitting in traffic, but freeway radio has eased my commute immensely.
[02:20:36.812 --> 02:20:39.315]  Call them today at 1-866-404-3600 and let them do the same for you.
[02:20:44.116 --> 02:20:46.638]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:47.319 --> 02:20:56.967]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[02:20:57.968 --> 02:21:07.476]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that'll let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[02:21:08.516 --> 02:21:14.018]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation Chapter 13.
[02:21:14.799 --> 02:21:22.522]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:21:50.091 --> 02:21:52.013]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:52.493 --> 02:21:55.235]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:21:56.559 --> 02:21:59.822]  Crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[02:22:00.422 --> 02:22:01.983]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:22:02.044 --> 02:22:03.465]  until 2 p.m.
[02:22:03.845 --> 02:22:04.906]  Central Standard Time.
[02:22:04.966 --> 02:22:07.188]  Back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:22:07.548 --> 02:22:13.533]  Blasting out on the AM and FM dial from sunny Southern California to Providence, Rhode Island.
[02:22:14.133 --> 02:22:16.916]  And, of course, going out on the global shortwave during the day.
[02:22:17.016 --> 02:22:19.698]  Coming up next Monday, you'll hear us on a new frequency.
[02:22:20.158 --> 02:22:22.840]  WWCR is switching frequencies to 9.985.
[02:22:23.581 --> 02:22:25.683]  Only do that every once in a while.
[02:22:25.743 --> 02:22:26.043]  I guess the
[02:22:26.798 --> 02:22:27.799]  Some request or something.
[02:22:27.839 --> 02:22:30.540]  So 9.985 next Monday.
[02:22:30.560 --> 02:22:33.222]  And of course at night, 9 to midnight, same thing, 3210.
[02:22:33.982 --> 02:22:38.085]  Same old frequency and that will be posted at Infowars.com on the listen page.
[02:22:39.045 --> 02:22:42.567]  Let us go to the calls now for our esteemed guest, Raleigh James.
[02:22:43.368 --> 02:22:45.489]  Let's talk to Malta in Denmark.
[02:22:45.529 --> 02:22:47.110]  I'm going to these calls quick, so be ready.
[02:22:47.370 --> 02:22:47.971]  Hello Alex.
[02:22:48.351 --> 02:22:48.971]  Hello Malta.
[02:22:48.991 --> 02:22:53.574]  We want to talk about the chip and the DN National Records.
[02:22:54.369 --> 02:22:59.794]  They just expanded the Danish National Registrar for people in indictment.
[02:23:00.595 --> 02:23:05.439]  Now it's crime from a low to up to 18 months.
[02:23:05.960 --> 02:23:07.061]  You get in the registrar.
[02:23:07.361 --> 02:23:08.242]  Okay, let me stop you.
[02:23:08.282 --> 02:23:10.004]  I think what you're saying is what's happening here.
[02:23:10.544 --> 02:23:13.847]  If you're just arrested or indicted, you go into a DNA database.
[02:23:14.208 --> 02:23:14.808]  Not arrested.
[02:23:15.509 --> 02:23:16.070]  Indicted.
[02:23:16.690 --> 02:23:18.432]  You get in the registrar for crimes.
[02:23:19.915 --> 02:23:21.276]  Up to 18 months.
[02:23:21.757 --> 02:23:23.038]  Sir, certain U.S.
[02:23:23.078 --> 02:23:38.148]  states are proposing, and the feds are proposing in the Patriot Act too, this is on my website, the actual subsections, that if you're even pulled over and arrested for a parking ticket, they're going to take a cheek swab of your cells.
[02:23:38.168 --> 02:23:39.529]  Thanks for the call, Malta.
[02:23:39.549 --> 02:23:42.731]  Let me get a comment on that from Raleigh James.
[02:23:42.751 --> 02:23:46.614]  It doesn't matter if it's Denmark or England or the U.S., the same system is going in.
[02:23:47.074 --> 02:23:51.156]  Oh, of course it is, and they get it in by the carrot and the stick.
[02:23:51.816 --> 02:23:56.998]  The carrot, of course, is that the oldest for the children, the individuals who want to be protected.
[02:23:57.618 --> 02:24:01.240]  The stick is pick any group that is socially unacceptable.
[02:24:01.320 --> 02:24:05.842]  They'll start it with things like child molesters and things like that.
[02:24:05.882 --> 02:24:08.843]  Well, of course, we need their database, and that's been going on for a while.
[02:24:08.883 --> 02:24:10.864]  Well, now it's expanded, as you say,
[02:24:11.277 --> 02:24:22.722]  To the point that it's now proposed and it's on the California ballot, in fact, coming up next week about going ahead and taking the DNA of everyone who is arrested.
[02:24:22.802 --> 02:24:24.963]  Like you say, not even charged, just arrested.
[02:24:26.222 --> 02:24:32.326]  And they're talking about period, folks, and a bunch of other states are proposing this, so good questions you brought up.
[02:24:33.186 --> 02:24:37.229]  An important point here is that we talk about implantable microchips five, six years ago.
[02:24:37.269 --> 02:24:37.789]  We were nuts.
[02:24:38.349 --> 02:24:39.910]  I was just going off the federal documents.
[02:24:40.010 --> 02:24:43.392]  Now, if you want to be a Mexican judicial worker, you've got to have it.
[02:24:43.452 --> 02:24:45.133]  Now they're expanding it out to other agencies.
[02:24:45.513 --> 02:24:47.134]  The Italian government's proposing it.
[02:24:47.635 --> 02:24:49.215]  But some governments are actually doing it.
[02:24:49.275 --> 02:24:50.776]  Now special forces are getting it.
[02:24:50.816 --> 02:24:51.757]  We've confirmed that.
[02:24:52.829 --> 02:24:57.293]  Since my cousin first told me in Special Forces a year ago they were getting the chip, it's now happening.
[02:24:57.673 --> 02:25:01.577]  And then now Time Magazine for Kids, almost every issue is how great the chip is.
[02:25:01.997 --> 02:25:04.639]  It's been promoted on shows like CSI Miami.
[02:25:05.240 --> 02:25:06.941]  All the coolest clubs have got it.
[02:25:06.981 --> 02:25:07.842]  You gotta have it.
[02:25:08.102 --> 02:25:10.044]  Raleigh, they're really doing a job on us.
[02:25:10.064 --> 02:25:12.166]  They're selling it as security and as a fad.
[02:25:12.406 --> 02:25:12.766]  Oh sure.
[02:25:12.826 --> 02:25:19.632]  You're going to see the missing child that everybody's frantic about who successfully returned because of the chip.
[02:25:19.712 --> 02:25:20.773]  That'll be in the news.
[02:25:21.269 --> 02:25:22.570]  That'll be a staged event.
[02:25:22.790 --> 02:25:23.450]  Yeah, of course.
[02:25:23.710 --> 02:25:34.895]  And then, like you say, that club in Barcelona, Spain, where if you had a chip, only you could get into the VIP room with the elite stars, and people were lined up around the block.
[02:25:35.415 --> 02:25:36.716]  So, sure.
[02:25:37.576 --> 02:25:42.238]  Remember, these are the same people who are ordering on Starz, so why should the chip bother them?
[02:25:43.194 --> 02:25:47.815]  They want to be groveling mindless slaves, and when you warn them, they'll just laugh at you.
[02:25:49.096 --> 02:25:51.216]  I mean, they have childlike minds.
[02:25:51.456 --> 02:25:54.917]  They will face nothing that is painful to their little brain.
[02:25:55.457 --> 02:26:05.380]  Well, no, but you see that, like I said, with all the people who are ushering in more of the social programs that are getting to the heart of having us part with our constitutional freedoms.
[02:26:05.996 --> 02:26:12.620]  And, you know, they laugh at anybody who would see the government as anything other than benevolent.
[02:26:12.780 --> 02:26:14.441]  And by the way, they call all this a service.
[02:26:14.481 --> 02:26:18.043]  A service is something that you go out and you want or you have control.
[02:26:18.403 --> 02:26:20.785]  The IRS and all this is not a service, folks.
[02:26:20.845 --> 02:26:22.406]  It's a business on you.
[02:26:22.646 --> 02:26:23.927]  It's all about enslavement.
[02:26:24.147 --> 02:26:25.848]  Let's talk to Brooke in Rhode Island.
[02:26:26.228 --> 02:26:26.988]  Brooke, you're on the air.
[02:26:27.028 --> 02:26:27.489]  Go ahead.
[02:26:27.509 --> 02:26:28.930]  Hi, Alex.
[02:26:29.010 --> 02:26:30.290]  This is Brooke in Rhode Island.
[02:26:30.991 --> 02:26:31.891]  Good to speak to you.
[02:26:33.507 --> 02:26:42.829]  I'd like to take the risk to make the prediction that the Boston Red Sox are going to win and John Kerry is going to be the next president.
[02:26:44.389 --> 02:26:47.170]  But that is not the real reason I'm calling you.
[02:26:47.970 --> 02:26:54.331]  I'm calling you because of something you mentioned about judges and Supreme Court judges.
[02:26:56.052 --> 02:27:01.933]  Several weeks ago, there was a story in the New York Post titled, Orgy in the Court.
[02:27:02.639 --> 02:27:04.079]  Scalia's gone wild.
[02:27:04.099 --> 02:27:06.020]  Yes, Scalia said orgies are good for you.
[02:27:06.140 --> 02:27:07.060]  It's a great question.
[02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:16.942]  He's addressing students at Harvard and saying that orgies were a wonderful thing and everybody should engage in orgies.
[02:27:17.402 --> 02:27:19.202]  And I was wondering if you heard this story?
[02:27:19.902 --> 02:27:22.883]  Well, sir, if you say you admire Hitler, you're conservative.
[02:27:23.383 --> 02:27:25.123]  If you fight Hitler, you're anti-Semitic.
[02:27:25.683 --> 02:27:28.063]  If you say orgies are good, it's Christian and conservative.
[02:27:28.083 --> 02:27:30.904]  If you say that that might not be too Christian, you must be Satanist.
[02:27:31.540 --> 02:27:32.021]  Uh, stay there.
[02:27:32.061 --> 02:27:34.264]  We'll talk about the double think when we get back.
[02:27:35.707 --> 02:27:36.628]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.109 --> 02:27:38.711]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.632 --> 02:27:42.317]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:28:16.595 --> 02:28:17.696]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[02:28:17.856 --> 02:28:18.636]  Which are collectible?
[02:28:18.696 --> 02:28:19.417]  Which are bullion?

[02:29:02.714 --> 02:29:14.065]  When used, water flow through the purification elements, where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:29:14.645 --> 02:29:21.488]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:29:21.888 --> 02:29:24.029]  Your purified water is now ready!
[02:29:24.529 --> 02:29:29.511]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[02:29:29.791 --> 02:29:36.554]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:36.734 --> 02:29:40.355]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:29:40.595 --> 02:29:41.396]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.097 --> 02:29:46.638]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:29:46.798 --> 02:29:47.938]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:29:48.118 --> 02:29:51.539]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache and nausea.
[02:29:51.639 --> 02:29:52.040]  Phenol!
[02:29:52.380 --> 02:29:59.462]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure and cardiac arrest.
[02:29:59.782 --> 02:30:03.905]  EDTA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:30:04.005 --> 02:30:04.446]  Fragrance?
[02:30:04.826 --> 02:30:09.590]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:30:09.730 --> 02:30:14.413]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[02:30:14.633 --> 02:30:17.195]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Calben shampoo.
[02:30:17.456 --> 02:30:20.858]  Well, like all of the products from the Calben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:30:21.018 --> 02:30:24.521]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:30:24.741 --> 02:30:27.102]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:30:27.262 --> 02:30:28.142]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:30:28.262 --> 02:30:38.006]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[02:30:48.211 --> 02:30:54.253]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:54.853 --> 02:30:57.794]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:00.695 --> 02:31:03.315]  Raleigh.net's her website with two L's.
[02:31:03.355 --> 02:31:07.116]  She's Raleigh James, syndicated broadcaster on the AM and FM dial.
[02:31:07.136 --> 02:31:10.157]  Flagship out of Philadelphia, 1210 WVHT.
[02:31:13.368 --> 02:31:23.020]  P-H-T, can't get that straight, and of course live from, what, 10 to 1 Eastern, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:31:23.060 --> 02:31:25.243]  Powerful broadcast also on XM.
[02:31:26.144 --> 02:31:28.447]  Raleigh, what channel on XM Radio?
[02:31:28.467 --> 02:31:29.388]  165, the Ask Channel.
[02:31:31.650 --> 02:31:35.974]  All right, that's really growing, so that's exciting to know folks like you were on there.
[02:31:36.635 --> 02:31:38.877]  I want to go back to the callers here.
[02:31:38.917 --> 02:31:44.083]  Just get through a bunch of these and let you cover any other key topics you want to talk about and a few other stories I want to get to.
[02:31:44.103 --> 02:31:45.344]  So callers, just make it quick.
[02:31:45.364 --> 02:31:48.727]  I mean, I said that to myself more than anybody because I always want to hear you elaborate.
[02:31:49.328 --> 02:31:51.310]  Brooke and Rhode Island, finish up the point we're making.
[02:31:51.770 --> 02:31:52.510]  Oh yeah, Alex.
[02:31:52.910 --> 02:31:55.951]  Can I just quickly read a couple things from this article?
[02:31:55.971 --> 02:32:01.752]  Yeah, restate what you were talking about, because I never... I'll be honest, I forgot what you were saying during the break.
[02:32:02.073 --> 02:32:04.053]  We were talking about Anton Scalia.
[02:32:04.713 --> 02:32:06.694]  Oh yeah, the orgies at Harvard.
[02:32:07.034 --> 02:32:07.774]  How good they are, yeah.
[02:32:08.234 --> 02:32:20.457]  Scalia denounced abstract moralizing by judges and said that some matters such as abortion and assisted suicide were too fundamental to be decided by them.
[02:32:21.809 --> 02:32:32.495]  He ridiculed a European Court of Human Rights ruling that struck down, as an invasion of privacy, a British law barring group sex by gays.
[02:32:33.955 --> 02:32:35.336]  Is this unbelievable, or what?
[02:32:35.536 --> 02:32:37.057]  Well, let me just... it's more double-think.
[02:32:37.297 --> 02:32:38.018]  Let me just say this.
[02:32:38.038 --> 02:32:42.280]  You've got seven of the nine members of the Supreme Court put in by Republicans, and we've had
[02:32:43.738 --> 02:32:50.220]  The most draconian, authoritarian, despotic, tyrannical Supreme Court ever.
[02:32:50.800 --> 02:32:53.421]  And most of the time the Democrats that are on there are voting with him.
[02:32:53.441 --> 02:32:57.862]  So this thing of, get Bush in, he'll get good judges in, he's so good!
[02:32:58.602 --> 02:33:00.243]  Let's get a comment from Raleigh James, Raleigh.
[02:33:00.683 --> 02:33:17.208]  I'm always suspect when the subject of sex comes up, whether it's comments by a judge or whether it's the morphing of Clinton's impeachment, which of course had nothing as far as I'm concerned to do with Monica Lewinsky, everything to do with perjury or Chinagate or whatever.
[02:33:17.928 --> 02:33:23.390]  Sex is most powerful as a topic because as soon as it's raised,
[02:33:23.840 --> 02:33:29.670]  People immediately get involved in the discussion and forget the basics of what we should be talking about.
[02:33:29.690 --> 02:33:31.473]  Yeah, it's our primary programming.
[02:33:31.774 --> 02:33:35.841]  It's a smokescreen, and so anytime I hear somebody bringing up something that is
[02:33:37.090 --> 02:33:48.202]  You know, titillating, not in a pornographic sense, but in terms of just for folks who get off on these discussions, sexual in nature, I wonder, what are we covering?
[02:33:48.482 --> 02:33:58.693]  Well, I mean, I'm not criticizing Brooke for bringing this up because, you know, he's this big hypocrite about sex and how Christian he is, and then he spouts off in the Harvard newspaper
[02:33:59.473 --> 02:34:03.738]  And the bigger story is the hypocritical nature of the so-called Christian conservatives.
[02:34:04.038 --> 02:34:08.043]  I consider myself to be a Christian and a real conservative, paleo-conservative.
[02:34:08.843 --> 02:34:09.724]  They're quiet about it.
[02:34:09.764 --> 02:34:16.632]  It's like the New York Post reporting how top gay porn stars are shipped into Bohemian Grove to quote, service the members.
[02:34:17.145 --> 02:34:17.405]  Right.
[02:34:18.306 --> 02:34:21.368]  And that, as you well know first hand, is absolutely true.
[02:34:21.788 --> 02:34:24.190]  No, I'm certainly not criticizing Brooke.
[02:34:24.250 --> 02:34:31.094]  My question, though, is anytime I hear the word sex, I look deeper to see what we're not covering, because usually we're hiding something else.
[02:34:31.335 --> 02:34:32.175]  Oh, I agree with you.
[02:34:32.435 --> 02:34:33.156]  I mean, obviously...
[02:34:33.977 --> 02:34:38.282]  Uh, Ken Starr was in the law firm that represented the Communist Chinese military.
[02:34:38.522 --> 02:34:41.726]  The Republicans in Rumsfeld were involved making the transfers.
[02:34:41.806 --> 02:34:43.728]  Clinton signed off on the traitorous activities.
[02:34:44.048 --> 02:34:46.911]  And so they didn't want to go after Clinton on something they were all dirty on.
[02:34:47.132 --> 02:34:53.079]  It had to be one specific, uh, uh, you know, sectioned off sexual issue of address.
[02:34:53.699 --> 02:34:59.343]  And cigars and stuff in the Oval Office because that was specific to only Bill Clinton.
[02:34:59.543 --> 02:35:04.966]  They couldn't attack him on all the other galaxy of corruption because they were all involved in it too.
[02:35:05.306 --> 02:35:06.247]  Absolutely.
[02:35:07.728 --> 02:35:08.528]  Very well said, Raleigh.
[02:35:08.548 --> 02:35:09.549]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[02:35:09.589 --> 02:35:11.430]  Thank you for the call, Brooke.
[02:35:11.450 --> 02:35:14.332]  Let's talk to... Oh, I got mixed up.
[02:35:14.372 --> 02:35:15.052]  Who's up next here?
[02:35:15.973 --> 02:35:16.873]  Kenny in Texas.
[02:35:17.073 --> 02:35:17.974]  Kenny, how you doing?
[02:35:18.014 --> 02:35:18.894]  Hey, Alex.
[02:35:18.934 --> 02:35:19.415]  How are you?
[02:35:19.555 --> 02:35:19.755]  Good.
[02:35:19.875 --> 02:35:20.195]  Go ahead.
[02:35:20.375 --> 02:35:21.036]  Love your work, man.
[02:35:22.236 --> 02:35:27.765]  Got a couple of shiny examples in the city of Houston about some of the issues that you've been talking about.
[02:35:27.785 --> 02:35:30.069]  I lived in Austin for like the last three years.
[02:35:30.410 --> 02:35:31.151]  Drop it on me!
[02:35:31.351 --> 02:35:33.175]  Got a couple of concrete examples here.
[02:35:35.049 --> 02:35:39.512]  Just the other day, there's supposedly a dumping problem in the city of Houston.
[02:35:39.572 --> 02:35:51.721]  So let me guess, they've got to put up hidden cameras in all rural areas on side roads, and they're going to have little lines in the parks, little robotic cameras that are very cheap and good for you, go back and forth.
[02:35:51.921 --> 02:35:57.946]  At the discernment of the people that live in the neighborhood, of course, with the homeowners associations involved.
[02:35:59.432 --> 02:36:12.021]  Nationwide, these cameras are going up, and already several thousand on little trolleys have been put up in the most rural areas and on side streets, and they just so happen to be able to look at your house.
[02:36:13.322 --> 02:36:15.504]  I'm sorry, and I'm not trying to act like I'm smart and know everything.
[02:36:15.524 --> 02:36:17.165]  It's just that I knew where this was going.
[02:36:18.185 --> 02:36:19.806]  Let's let Raleigh comment on this first, though.
[02:36:20.107 --> 02:36:21.648]  Raleigh, this stuff's going in everywhere.
[02:36:22.028 --> 02:36:22.588]  Well, sure it is.
[02:36:22.869 --> 02:36:27.312]  And, you know, in fact, one of the things that I had mentioned I'd talk about tonight on the air is
[02:36:28.577 --> 02:36:32.460]  Reality TV is a big conditioning of this as well.
[02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:34.801]  It's frightening us to have cameras, it's glamorous.
[02:36:35.101 --> 02:36:37.963]  Right, and a lot of people are saying it's cheap entertainment.
[02:36:37.983 --> 02:36:40.865]  To hell with cheap entertainment, it's easy indoctrination.
[02:36:41.265 --> 02:36:45.808]  You know, when we see people who have no problem being filmed in their most private moments.
[02:36:45.868 --> 02:36:49.430]  I mean, we're already desensitized to cameras in every establishment.
[02:36:49.470 --> 02:36:52.332]  You can't go into a department... We've caught them putting them in school bathrooms!
[02:36:52.492 --> 02:36:53.413]  Well, that's right!
[02:36:54.153 --> 02:36:54.713]  Absolutely.
[02:36:54.773 --> 02:36:57.275]  And Jim showers and things like...
[02:36:57.595 --> 02:36:58.336]  Things like this.
[02:36:58.496 --> 02:37:07.923]  And so, we're so desensitized to it already, and we know what's happening with E-ZPass on the highways and stuff like that, that the next step is just everywhere.
[02:37:08.824 --> 02:37:12.306]  The real challenge is going to be to get them into our homes.
[02:37:12.606 --> 02:37:13.347]  And they will.
[02:37:13.587 --> 02:37:17.490]  They're already doing it with the new computers that automatically have the camera built in.
[02:37:17.510 --> 02:37:17.850]  Right.
[02:37:18.130 --> 02:37:21.553]  The new cable boxes have a microphone in them, even though it's not part of the application.
[02:37:21.993 --> 02:37:23.394]  The Scientific Atlantic boxes.
[02:37:23.895 --> 02:37:26.677]  Tevo, remember when Janet Jackson showed her breast?
[02:37:27.017 --> 02:37:28.898]  Well, at the end of this article it reminded me of you.
[02:37:28.918 --> 02:37:29.499]  It said, just casually,
[02:37:42.828 --> 02:37:50.999]  Um, what we're going to do to deter people from doing it will be, like, possibly a loudspeaker that'll say, we're taking your picture, we see you dumping in the neighborhood.
[02:37:51.119 --> 02:37:53.603]  That's already been done in England, so again, I'm not prophetic.
[02:37:54.204 --> 02:37:57.208]  It's just, I, you know, the federal plan is, and already where I live,
[02:37:57.848 --> 02:37:59.089]  Uh, they have cameras in the neighborhood.
[02:37:59.129 --> 02:38:01.630]  It went from the highways to the side streets down to the neighborhood.
[02:38:02.231 --> 02:38:11.376]  And, uh, in most big cities, they're now putting in little trolleys, little, little, little, uh, cameras that buzz around, and it just, and blimps, and it just... Right.
[02:38:11.837 --> 02:38:18.941]  And, and, and, so they're gonna... Yeah, they have a telescreen that makes a mean face, and then it shouts at you for even unsocial behavior.
[02:38:19.181 --> 02:38:25.025]  In fact, these things listen with shotgun mics in England where they're testing them, and if you say a cuss word to your dog, it goes,
[02:38:25.585 --> 02:38:26.806]  Now, that's not very friendly.
[02:38:26.866 --> 02:38:33.732]  I may have to fine you, and I can then face scan you, that's the next wave, and then send you a ticket, just like that movie Demolition Man.
[02:38:33.752 --> 02:38:35.053]  Did you see that, Raleigh?
[02:38:35.313 --> 02:38:35.733]  No.
[02:38:39.316 --> 02:38:40.397]  But this is freedom, Raleigh.
[02:38:40.577 --> 02:38:43.199]  Why can't we put those trolley cameras on the border, Raleigh?
[02:38:43.620 --> 02:38:44.300]  Well, of course.
[02:38:44.721 --> 02:38:45.681]  And that's the other thing.
[02:38:45.721 --> 02:38:50.125]  Individuals who will steadfastly say that they are safer because of these intrusions
[02:38:50.898 --> 02:38:59.180]  That's totally belied when you realize we have a wide open border, and for all sorts of reasons, even apart from terrorism.
[02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:06.202]  You know, the first time Vincente Fox said he was going to force us to pay his citizens' Social Security, I was outraged.
[02:39:06.802 --> 02:39:07.562]  Then I got it.
[02:39:08.042 --> 02:39:10.143]  You know, these are our slave class.
[02:39:10.243 --> 02:39:18.065]  These illegals are the people who have supplanted the slaves from the 1800s, and we absolutely want them coming over.
[02:39:19.443 --> 02:39:22.626]  Well, Vicente Fox just said that he wants a Pan-American Union.
[02:39:22.666 --> 02:39:24.047]  Of course, that's already been put into place.
[02:39:24.207 --> 02:39:24.507]  Yeah!
[02:39:24.888 --> 02:39:26.089]  And that's the plan.
[02:39:26.109 --> 02:39:27.430]  They just haven't told us yet.
[02:39:27.450 --> 02:39:32.454]  It's on C-SPAN when they have the meetings, but the American people don't know they have a national ID card.
[02:39:32.694 --> 02:39:34.496]  They don't know that they're getting rid of the sovereignty.
[02:39:34.936 --> 02:39:36.638]  They don't know any of this is happening.
[02:39:36.698 --> 02:39:37.739]  Thanks for the call, Kenny.
[02:39:38.499 --> 02:39:44.024]  Let's talk to Sidney now in Texas.
[02:39:44.064 --> 02:39:44.965]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:39:45.789 --> 02:39:49.072]  Alright Alex, I wanted to get your comment on two questions.
[02:39:49.533 --> 02:39:56.760]  The first one, when I try to tell my friends that this election is a big, you know, puppet show and, you know, they
[02:39:57.526 --> 02:40:01.768]  They kind of think I'm crazy and, you know, it seems like it's the only choice that they have.
[02:40:01.868 --> 02:40:05.910]  Why'd they go, oh, you mean government has manipulation?
[02:40:06.070 --> 02:40:07.610]  And that there's assassinations in history?
[02:40:07.630 --> 02:40:08.251]  That's impossible!
[02:40:08.411 --> 02:40:09.991]  And that governments ever did anything wrong?
[02:40:10.031 --> 02:40:11.572]  And that people should have freedom?
[02:40:11.712 --> 02:40:13.033]  Oh, you're some kind of nut!
[02:40:13.193 --> 02:40:16.094]  You're some kind of wild, crazy, oh, what's, oh, I'm sorry.
[02:40:16.914 --> 02:40:23.017]  What should I give them as choices, as other options that they can do, you know, since this is already
[02:40:24.291 --> 02:40:26.031]  Sorry, has a no certain outcome.
[02:40:26.071 --> 02:40:27.212]  What else did I say?
[02:40:27.252 --> 02:40:36.554]  Michael Perutka of the Constitution Party, Michael Bagnarek of the Libertarian Party, run themselves on a third party ticket locally, or be covert about it.
[02:40:36.594 --> 02:40:39.934]  Say you love the New World Order, run, get in office, and reverse the lie.
[02:40:39.954 --> 02:40:45.016]  Instead of saying you're good and lying once you get in office, say you're pro-New World Order, get in office.
[02:40:45.836 --> 02:40:50.557]  We may have to have secret societies of good people that run, claiming their New World Order.
[02:40:50.597 --> 02:40:51.717]  I've actually thought about that.
[02:40:52.297 --> 02:40:56.840]  But, I mean, if your friends are in denial about the puppet show, I mean, what planet are they living on, Raleigh?
[02:40:57.701 --> 02:40:59.902]  Well, again, it's expedience.
[02:41:00.623 --> 02:41:03.444]  If you deny it, then you don't have to be involved with it.
[02:41:03.484 --> 02:41:04.985]  All you have to do is go and vote.
[02:41:05.105 --> 02:41:13.951]  If you affirm it, now you're going to have to reorganize your life and get involved, and people will be in denial forever because they don't have the time or inclination to get involved.
[02:41:14.371 --> 02:41:14.592]  Yeah.
[02:41:14.872 --> 02:41:20.896]  And also, what do you think about this 666 debasement here, and what effect that's going to have on society when it comes out?
[02:41:20.916 --> 02:41:21.276]  That's it.
[02:41:22.381 --> 02:41:22.922]  What do I think?
[02:41:23.422 --> 02:41:24.443]  I couldn't understand what you said.
[02:41:24.483 --> 02:41:27.867]  The Beast movie, I saw it on Netflix Awards.
[02:41:28.868 --> 02:41:30.430]  Oh, how Jesus didn't exist?
[02:41:30.450 --> 02:41:31.090]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:41:31.310 --> 02:41:37.477]  I mean, that's just pure propaganda and just, you know, I guess their answer to the passion.
[02:41:38.078 --> 02:41:38.678]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:41:39.119 --> 02:41:39.859]  Yeah, you bet.
[02:41:40.700 --> 02:41:44.024]  Let's talk to, is it Alonda in Missouri?
[02:41:44.064 --> 02:41:44.925]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:41:47.737 --> 02:41:48.017]  Hello?
[02:41:48.297 --> 02:41:49.158]  Yes, you're on the air.
[02:41:49.178 --> 02:41:49.578]  Welcome.
[02:41:49.618 --> 02:41:50.418]  This is Wanda.
[02:41:50.738 --> 02:41:51.758]  Okay.
[02:41:51.939 --> 02:41:52.239]  Yes.
[02:41:53.319 --> 02:42:02.742]  I wanted to relate a story that had come out of Germany in World War II that I think correlates with what's coming now.
[02:42:03.603 --> 02:42:16.407]  And I had, the reason I had thought of this, I heard Dave von Kleist say that when you speak to people about the coming tragedy, you know, and everything,
[02:42:17.548 --> 02:42:27.994]  They just want to turn up their little microphones on their rap music and all of their rock music and don't want to face it.
[02:42:28.394 --> 02:42:30.095]  Yeah, the great delusion, yes.
[02:42:30.915 --> 02:42:31.175]  Yes.
[02:42:31.736 --> 02:42:34.977]  Well, this story was told by Penny Lee.
[02:42:35.057 --> 02:42:37.398]  She's the champion for Right to Life.
[02:42:38.259 --> 02:42:46.103]  And this German man had approached her and he said that in Germany, his church was right in front of the railroad track.
[02:42:47.091 --> 02:42:52.155]  And he said these cars were going by behind, full of Jews going to the oven.
[02:42:53.256 --> 02:43:00.201]  And he said they would be screaming and yelling and wanting to get attention and sympathy and prayers.
[02:43:00.221 --> 02:43:07.607]  But these people were so overwhelmed by this that they just sang a little louder.
[02:43:09.230 --> 02:43:13.011]  And nowadays it'll be, hmm, they're probably with Al-Qaeda, hmm.
[02:43:13.732 --> 02:43:20.114]  And by the way, all the real federal training is that homeschoolers are terrorists, conservatives are terrorists, gun owners are terrorists.
[02:43:20.334 --> 02:43:22.714]  That's what all the real federal drills are, by the way.
[02:43:23.054 --> 02:43:26.135]  And so they've got all the Christian conservatives going, kill all them Arabs.
[02:43:26.415 --> 02:43:31.137]  Well, I bet you're happy then, folks, because in Thailand they put people in these trucks
[02:43:31.617 --> 02:43:39.683]  And 78, now the number's grown, but this is the article from last night, 78 people died while being bused for protesting.
[02:43:40.224 --> 02:43:41.945]  And, Raleigh, comments?
[02:43:42.986 --> 02:43:50.811]  Well, you know, again, when we talk about Germany or whatever, and the old history repeats itself, human nature does not change.
[02:43:51.272 --> 02:43:57.016]  People will not, en masse, wake up very often until it's way too late.
[02:43:58.410 --> 02:44:05.557]  Well, a point I've made over and over again is that Hitler didn't brag about the camps, Hitler didn't promote it, he kept it a secret.
[02:44:05.777 --> 02:44:16.968]  Only in modern America does Michael Weiner, I mean Michael Savage, and Michelle Malkin, and now O'Reilly get up and say, anybody that disagrees with the government,
[02:44:17.771 --> 02:44:22.072]  I heard Joyce Riley say just recently that our country had purchased, I believe she said, 7,000
[02:44:47.409 --> 02:44:49.230]  Railroad cars from Germany.
[02:44:50.210 --> 02:44:53.831]  And of course this story came immediately to my mind.
[02:44:54.451 --> 02:44:57.332]  And I was thinking, no, it won't be the Jews.
[02:44:58.252 --> 02:45:00.733]  It will be the Christians.
[02:45:00.753 --> 02:45:03.514]  The so-called handicapped.
[02:45:03.914 --> 02:45:06.475]  Mentally handicapped and physically handicapped.
[02:45:06.495 --> 02:45:09.496]  Well, I'll tell you what the COINTELPRO documents, and thanks for the call, say it will be.
[02:45:10.456 --> 02:45:11.417]  This is how tyranny works.
[02:45:11.477 --> 02:45:14.077]  The local viceroy wants your business or wants your wife.
[02:45:14.317 --> 02:45:15.998]  He'll just have you arrested and no charges.
[02:45:16.796 --> 02:45:20.718]  Okay, or the COINTELPRO says liberal preachers, conservative preachers.
[02:45:21.158 --> 02:45:25.560]  Anybody who could have political power in a real tyranny, that's who they go after.
[02:45:25.620 --> 02:45:25.961]  Raleigh?
[02:45:26.421 --> 02:45:26.981]  Of course it is.
[02:45:27.441 --> 02:45:29.382]  Now, they won't go after everybody, though.
[02:45:29.422 --> 02:45:31.923]  They'll leave a couple people standing as examples.
[02:45:32.064 --> 02:45:36.666]  When it's brought up, they can say, well, if we were really doing this, this person would be gone.
[02:45:37.246 --> 02:45:38.987]  So, it's not complete.
[02:45:39.386 --> 02:45:42.389]  But sure, sure it'll be that way.
[02:45:42.409 --> 02:45:49.595]  I don't think there's a doubt, and I don't know what it'll take to cause people to awake.
[02:45:49.655 --> 02:45:53.638]  And that's, you know, frankly why I'm so glad you're doing your show, Alex.
[02:45:53.858 --> 02:45:57.901]  Because, you know, most of us are ready to look at retirement.
[02:45:58.022 --> 02:45:59.403]  You are our future.
[02:45:59.703 --> 02:46:04.767]  And when I hear your callers, who are young and vibrant, it gives me a certain amount of hope.
[02:46:04.847 --> 02:46:05.708]  Because our only
[02:46:06.172 --> 02:46:12.354]  Our only hope is widespread knowledge and belief and courage to act on it.
[02:46:13.254 --> 02:46:14.895]  Well, Raleigh, you're pretty young.
[02:46:14.915 --> 02:46:16.235]  You're going to be around for a long time.
[02:46:16.255 --> 02:46:16.775]  You better be.
[02:46:17.416 --> 02:46:25.298]  Well, I appreciate that, but it's wonderful to see you doing it, and like I say, and to see the callers doing it, because it's a very uphill battle.
[02:46:25.894 --> 02:46:35.261]  And if there's any hope in this, that hope is that the knowledge gets out there before they come to pick up the guns, which of course is where they will head.
[02:46:35.361 --> 02:46:38.543]  And they've got to do that first before their plan can be complete.
[02:46:38.723 --> 02:46:40.444]  And Josh Sugarman and the U.N.
[02:46:40.464 --> 02:46:47.289]  and all of them have said, we're going to get your guns, we've got the school children, even sent us a local paper a few years ago, we're going to get your guns very soon.
[02:46:48.223 --> 02:46:48.643]  Oh yeah!
[02:46:48.803 --> 02:46:51.225]  And you know, Canada actually, I'm very pleased.
[02:46:51.245 --> 02:46:59.629]  They've spent well over $2 billion now and less than 50% of the citizens have been compliant in gun registration, not even collection.
[02:46:59.970 --> 02:47:02.151]  And I think that that's a hopeful sign.
[02:47:02.491 --> 02:47:09.575]  And that is the one thing that we need to be very wary of, even the mention of a gun registration.
[02:47:10.140 --> 02:47:13.942]  Is when we will see the final steps to enslave us.
[02:47:14.162 --> 02:47:18.705]  Well that's what all these gun buybacks are for, is to give you news images of people turning their guns in.
[02:47:18.985 --> 02:47:19.405]  Of course!
[02:47:21.252 --> 02:47:22.634]  I mean, that's despicable, folks.
[02:47:22.734 --> 02:47:27.179]  Any mayor that has a gun buyback, anybody that's involved in this, need to move for their removal.
[02:47:27.820 --> 02:47:31.705]  I mean, the police supposedly work for us, so they've got the right to have guns that come from us.
[02:47:32.025 --> 02:47:33.246]  How can we not have the right?
[02:47:33.266 --> 02:47:39.253]  And again, Chicago has confiscated just tens and tens of thousands, what is it, 77,000 guns.
[02:47:41.115 --> 02:47:50.000]  Since 1996 when they banned all guns in Chicago, and their crime rate was already one of the highest, then it doubled again, now double what New York is with a gun ban.
[02:47:50.360 --> 02:48:00.426]  I mean, folks, they know it doesn't work, and then when you're behind five bars and latches in your house, you just call for more cops to keep you safe, who then treat you like total garbage.
[02:48:01.030 --> 02:48:03.912]  Well, the cops will tell you outright they cannot keep you safe.
[02:48:03.972 --> 02:48:14.160]  And, of course, all the research, like John Lott's wonderful More Guns, Less Crime, shows time and time again that if you want to increase crime, let the criminals know the citizenry is not armed.
[02:48:14.280 --> 02:48:17.762]  So, the idea of picking up a gun to make you safer is...
[02:48:19.222 --> 02:48:20.863]  It falls on the face of it.
[02:48:21.024 --> 02:48:22.585]  It's never about that.
[02:48:22.645 --> 02:48:25.787]  And this is one where we can look at history time and time again.
[02:48:25.807 --> 02:48:28.489]  It is always collective weaponry from the people.
[02:48:28.769 --> 02:48:29.310]  No kidding.
[02:48:29.350 --> 02:48:30.130]  It's common sense.
[02:48:30.150 --> 02:48:31.131]  Good place to end it.
[02:48:31.611 --> 02:48:33.913]  Raleigh.net, thank you so much for coming on.
[02:48:33.973 --> 02:48:36.015]  Raleigh James, folks can hear you 9 to midnight.
[02:48:36.395 --> 02:48:36.935]  God bless.
[02:48:37.195 --> 02:48:38.356]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:48:38.536 --> 02:48:39.177]  It's been great.
[02:48:39.457 --> 02:48:44.661]  We'll be back with the final segments and final comments, final news tidbits as we accelerate towards the 2004 election.
[02:48:45.638 --> 02:48:50.000]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.180 --> 02:48:54.602]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.742 --> 02:48:59.143]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.183 --> 02:49:00.504]  The New World Order.
[02:49:01.224 --> 02:49:02.265]  Panama!
[02:49:02.305 --> 02:49:06.527]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.587 --> 02:49:13.512]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.632 --> 02:49:15.713]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.013 --> 02:49:26.439]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.659 --> 02:49:28.621]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[02:49:29.241 --> 02:49:32.023]  My new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you!

[02:49:55.073 --> 02:50:05.460]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:50:05.620 --> 02:50:09.963]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:50:10.083 --> 02:50:10.944]  We're good to go!
[02:50:25.114 --> 02:50:25.574]  We're good to go.
[02:50:46.545 --> 02:50:46.846]  I think so.
[02:51:01.787 --> 02:51:02.428]  We're good to go.

[02:51:55.576 --> 02:52:00.219]  Alright folks, I can't take any more calls and I meant to spend 30 minutes on this today and I never did.
[02:52:00.239 --> 02:52:07.082]  It's an article here, British agents engineered capture of Care International's Margaret Hassan.
[02:52:08.383 --> 02:52:18.648]  And it says they've learned from credible sources in Iraq that the kidnapping of Margaret Hanson is an operation concocted by British agents inside the country in conjunction with her husband.
[02:52:19.148 --> 02:52:23.711]  Now the point I want to make here is, we've caught them in the past doing this just in the last year.
[02:52:24.525 --> 02:52:28.726]  You know, the FBI grabs you and gives you to Iraqi Security Forces and they saw your head off.
[02:52:29.166 --> 02:52:29.986]  And this is really happening.
[02:52:30.546 --> 02:52:47.170]  But I was reminded last night, listening to a report where they were admitting, and I've read this in the history books, from our own history, they had Roosevelt's grandson who ran the operation in 1943 in Iran on NPR, an old tape of him, admitting what they did.
[02:52:48.511 --> 02:52:49.731]  They had an elected
[02:52:51.747 --> 02:52:56.351]  Prime Minister, who was anti-communist, had thrown the communists out, was pro-West.
[02:52:57.092 --> 02:53:01.675]  So since he was being nice, they thought, we'll just throw him out, put this young prince on, and take all the oil.
[02:53:02.436 --> 02:53:05.659]  Well, he found out wouldn't go along with it, so our government, with the British,
[02:53:06.503 --> 02:53:08.465]  This is Roosevelt's grandson admitting all this.
[02:53:08.485 --> 02:53:09.386]  He's very proud of this.
[02:53:09.906 --> 02:53:18.333]  They went in 1943 and actually hired thousands of thugs to go out in several cities and shoot and kill thousands.
[02:53:18.433 --> 02:53:20.234]  They're very proud of this.
[02:53:20.574 --> 02:53:23.036]  To shoot mosques, to kill people, to blow things up.
[02:53:23.777 --> 02:53:28.180]  Riot the streets and yell, up with the Prime Minister and up with Communism.
[02:53:28.561 --> 02:53:30.062]  Because the Muslims hated Communism.
[02:53:31.154 --> 02:53:34.818]  Uh, and, uh, you know, this was a, you know, Persian, uh, you know, these aren't Arabs.
[02:53:34.838 --> 02:53:36.419]  And then they were pro-West, folks.
[02:53:37.340 --> 02:53:38.381]  Uh, and anti-Communist.
[02:53:39.442 --> 02:53:43.986]  And then they hired another group of thugs to attack them, supposedly working for the Prince.
[02:53:44.066 --> 02:53:50.352]  Oh, look, the Prince is fighting back against the Prime Minister and his thugs, running around, going up with Communism, shooting and killing and bombing.
[02:53:51.133 --> 02:54:02.843]  And then, here we are from 1943, with this NPR piece I heard, and I'd always read this and knew this, this was admitted, but here they were, all these people on the radio, admitting what they did, very proud.
[02:54:02.883 --> 02:54:09.589]  Well, we went out and started shitting and killing everyone, and blaming it on the Iranian leadership, and it worked quite nicely!
[02:54:10.393 --> 02:54:13.256]  Then they put the Shah in, start the torture camps, the rest of it.
[02:54:13.477 --> 02:54:16.180]  Then there's a counter-revolution and Ayatollah Khomeini gets in.
[02:54:16.440 --> 02:54:22.627]  So we go from somebody who loves us and who's elected and who's anti-communist to the Ayatollah Khomeini because of what the CIA did.
[02:54:22.667 --> 02:54:24.890]  Did I say 43?
[02:54:24.930 --> 02:54:25.331]  It was, uh, 1953.
[02:54:25.451 --> 02:54:25.731]  There we go.
[02:54:29.810 --> 02:54:33.051]  So, just another example of problem, reaction, solution.
[02:54:33.071 --> 02:54:35.432]  We can't wait 50 years for them to admit 9-11.
[02:54:35.452 --> 02:54:45.755]  You know, some member of the 9-11 operation on radio or TV going, yes, we did it, we're very good, you know, I'm a big hero, I'm so brave.
[02:54:47.516 --> 02:54:48.236]  Oh my goodness.
[02:54:48.896 --> 02:54:56.799]  An article here out of Delaware News, a civilian backdoor draft for civilian workers are being told they're about to be forcibly injected with the
[02:54:57.990 --> 02:55:01.916]  Anthrax and smallpox inoculations and be drafted off to war.
[02:55:02.016 --> 02:55:06.442]  So that's on InfoWars.net.
[02:55:06.522 --> 02:55:09.265]  Clearly flight 587 to New York was blown up.
[02:55:10.227 --> 02:55:12.910]  But now they're saying it's like TWA flight 800.
[02:55:13.211 --> 02:55:15.434]  It was the pilot's fault all the way.
[02:55:16.164 --> 02:55:17.205]  We're out of time, folks.
[02:55:17.305 --> 02:55:20.427]  I'll be back tomorrow from 11 to 2 during the day.
[02:55:20.447 --> 02:55:22.328]  Of course, at night, 9 to midnight central.
[02:55:22.789 --> 02:55:25.811]  New shortwave frequency starting next Monday, 9.985.
[02:55:25.891 --> 02:55:26.371]  During the day, 9.985.
[02:55:26.411 --> 02:55:27.672]  And at night, it's the same, 3210.
[02:55:31.955 --> 02:55:35.356]  On the last 60 seconds here, go to InfoWars.com.

[02:56:15.705 --> 02:56:19.827]  Now get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:19.887 --> 02:56:20.767]  Expose tyranny.
[02:56:20.807 --> 02:56:23.128]  And again, another example, get my videos and make copies of them.
[02:56:23.148 --> 02:56:23.748]  Get them out to people.

[02:56:28.389 --> 02:56:33.979]  We'll be here covering the staged election right through next week, so be sure and tell your friends to tune in.
[02:56:35.582 --> 02:56:36.163]  Hello, folks!
