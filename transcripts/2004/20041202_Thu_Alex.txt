[00:00:05.447 --> 00:00:06.087]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.748 --> 00:00:07.808]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:09.609]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:11.090]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.371]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:17.073]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.593 --> 00:00:21.695]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.996 --> 00:00:38.498]  Alright, my friends, it is Thursday, the second day of December, 2004.
[00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:42.899]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:51.902]  We'll be live here for the next three hours, Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:00:53.402 --> 00:00:55.383]  The broadcast is not left or right.
[00:00:56.143 --> 00:00:57.304]  It's about right and wrong.
[00:00:57.824 --> 00:01:01.845]  When I opposed Bill Clinton, I was called an ultra-right-wing extremist.
[00:01:03.027 --> 00:01:04.228]  By the mainstream media.
[00:01:05.068 --> 00:01:10.110]  Now I'm called a liberal by the mainstream media because I oppose George W. Bush.
[00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:12.772]  I've always been the same person.
[00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:18.014]  You can call me a constitutionalist, a paleo-conservative, if you like.
[00:01:18.694 --> 00:01:28.199]  But this broadcast reaches out to liberals, conservatives, libertarians, Christians, anyone who wants freedom and liberty.
[00:01:28.982 --> 00:01:33.106]  And we cut through the balkanization, through the distractions, through the diversions.
[00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:35.928]  We're able to reach out and bring people together.
[00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.574]  And the best news I've got for you is I've now done over 1,800 radio interviews.
[00:01:42.594 --> 00:01:46.197]  1,800 radio interviews.
[00:01:46.497 --> 00:01:49.520]  And I might have had a couple hundred callers that called in and disagreed.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.182]  Tens of thousands who called in and agreed with me.
[00:01:52.642 --> 00:01:54.144]  Even when they were attacking me.
[00:01:54.224 --> 00:01:55.665]  Even when the host was attacking me.
[00:01:57.808 --> 00:02:09.158]  And on top of this, my own broadcast on a lot of different AM and FM stations across the country, shortwave, the internet, satellite, really nobody calls in to disagree here.
[00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:15.363]  Best news I got for you, five, six years ago, half the phone calls disagreed.
[00:02:17.685 --> 00:02:20.828]  You see, we've won the fight for the hearts and minds predominantly.
[00:02:20.868 --> 00:02:22.189]  We've really got a majority.
[00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.850]  But that majority feels like they're the minority.
[00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:36.234]  It feels like they're alone by themselves because the mainstream media still creates the illusion that we're by ourselves.
[00:02:37.355 --> 00:02:39.676]  Alright, big broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:02:41.216 --> 00:02:43.617]  Coming up here in about 25 minutes.
[00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:47.559]  Lawyer sues FBI over brother's death.
[00:02:49.747 --> 00:02:59.351]  There were a lot of murders, as we've covered, of people who tried to expose government involvement in the Oklahoma City bombing, and his brother was clearly murdered.
[00:03:01.652 --> 00:03:04.573]  And we have the photographs, the autopsy photos going up.
[00:03:05.494 --> 00:03:07.435]  Warnings, they are gruesome.
[00:03:08.815 --> 00:03:15.538]  We've had police officers that worked the case on this broadcast to talk about police officers who they found guilty.
[00:03:16.542 --> 00:03:17.482]  Hands bound.
[00:03:18.182 --> 00:03:19.563]  Tortured massively.
[00:03:20.343 --> 00:03:24.304]  And then the government would say, it's a suicide.
[00:03:24.324 --> 00:03:26.685]  So we're talking about cop killers here as well.
[00:03:29.705 --> 00:03:31.986]  But if the government kills cops, it's okay, I guess.
[00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:35.047]  Then it's A-OK.
[00:03:36.027 --> 00:03:38.287]  Well, we think cop killing's wrong here.
[00:03:38.887 --> 00:03:41.248]  I know we're anti-government because we believe that.
[00:03:42.148 --> 00:03:44.769]  But his brother was in another one of these casualties.
[00:03:46.525 --> 00:03:53.611]  So we'll be talking to Attorney Jesse Trentadoob, coming up here in about 25 minutes.
[00:03:54.932 --> 00:04:14.569]  Coming up in the second hour, something you do not want to miss, we're halfway into the second hour, we're going to be talking to John Moore, police officer, Green Beret, expert on the New World Order,
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:23.003]  He'll be sharing his experience and worldview with us coming up in the middle of the next hour.
[00:04:24.584 --> 00:04:30.086]  And I'm trying to get the club owners on who are putting microchips in their patrons here in the U.S.
[00:04:30.106 --> 00:04:41.011]  Before it was ever a newspaper in the West, we had the European distributor for Verichip on to give us lots of inside scoops on nightmares earlier this year.
[00:04:43.687 --> 00:04:47.072]  And now we've picked up on it here in the U.S., so we're trying to get that for you as well.
[00:04:47.092 --> 00:04:59.388]  A lot of other news we'll cover when we get back before we get our first guest on, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, ArnoldExposed.com.
[00:04:59.408 --> 00:04:59.849]  Stay with us.
[00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:08.944]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.365 --> 00:05:13.589]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:13.829 --> 00:05:20.876]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.256 --> 00:05:27.362]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.502 --> 00:05:28.723]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:28.903 --> 00:05:29.364]  We're good to go.
[00:05:45.823 --> 00:05:48.966]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[00:05:48.986 --> 00:05:49.066]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.086 --> 00:05:49.126]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.326 --> 00:05:50.167]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:05:50.227 --> 00:05:50.487]  Call today.
[00:06:01.067 --> 00:06:01.687]  Terrorism.
[00:06:01.988 --> 00:06:02.748]  Terrorism.
[00:06:02.848 --> 00:06:03.668]  Chemical attacks.
[00:06:03.748 --> 00:06:04.409]  Dirty bombs.
[00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:04.909]  Fallout.
[00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:05.990]  Biological attack.
[00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.710]  Anthrax.
[00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.911]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:06:09.151 --> 00:06:10.752]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:06:10.992 --> 00:06:13.473]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:13.853 --> 00:06:28.441]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:28.481 --> 00:06:28.801]  government.
[00:06:28.961 --> 00:06:30.762]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:06:31.122 --> 00:06:37.044]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:37.205 --> 00:06:41.666]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[00:06:41.926 --> 00:06:48.649]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:51.350]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:07:00.248 --> 00:07:01.749]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.032]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:07:05.152 --> 00:07:09.076]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:07:09.116 --> 00:07:13.360]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.463]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:07:17.543 --> 00:07:19.405]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:07:19.605 --> 00:07:22.907]  The riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:07:22.947 --> 00:07:27.670]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.872]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:33.894]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:07:34.395 --> 00:07:40.519]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:44.842]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:07:45.242 --> 00:07:46.603]  Order your video today.
[00:07:46.944 --> 00:07:48.044]  Call toll-free at 888-253-3139.
[00:07:48.104 --> 00:07:53.468]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139.
[00:07:54.569 --> 00:07:59.253]  Or go to my website, Infowars.com.
[00:08:00.774 --> 00:08:05.837]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.198 --> 00:08:08.439]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:21.161]  All right, there is a prominent lawyer who's suing the FBI for clear prior knowledge of the Oklahoma City bombing, Jesse Trentadoob.
[00:08:23.022 --> 00:08:25.223]  And his brother was clearly murdered.
[00:08:25.243 --> 00:08:32.505]  It's kind of like these Arkansides where people are shot in the back of the head and have torture marks all over them and thrown out in the field.
[00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:35.306]  And then the medical examiner says, oh, it's suicide.
[00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:40.070]  And we're posting some of the grisly photos, per his request.
[00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:43.711]  You can see the reality of this on the site.
[00:08:43.751 --> 00:08:47.793]  And it isn't just this gentleman's brother who was killed for knowing too much.
[00:08:48.073 --> 00:08:56.136]  Police, medical examiners, coroners, a lot of people got threats or were killed surrounding this.
[00:08:56.156 --> 00:09:00.497]  And I'm tempted to try to get Colonel Craig Roberts on.
[00:09:00.977 --> 00:09:01.798]  I've got his number.
[00:09:01.838 --> 00:09:05.019]  I just thought of it when I left my office to go to the studio.
[00:09:06.172 --> 00:09:07.173]  I've got his number here somewhere.
[00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:08.093]  I printed it off.
[00:09:08.133 --> 00:09:10.054]  I need to call and see if Craig Roberts is home.
[00:09:11.155 --> 00:09:12.036]  Colonel Craig Roberts.
[00:09:13.156 --> 00:09:14.657]  I know a bunch of our listeners have got his number.
[00:09:14.717 --> 00:09:15.217]  Call him up.
[00:09:15.237 --> 00:09:16.278]  Tell him to call in right now.
[00:09:16.298 --> 00:09:23.522]  Because Craig worked the case as a detective for several years with the FBI.
[00:09:23.542 --> 00:09:24.463]  He can tell you all about it.
[00:09:25.183 --> 00:09:29.066]  There in Oklahoma City and all over the state.
[00:09:29.126 --> 00:09:34.729]  And he investigated the murder of one particular police officer by, well, clearly the good old...
[00:09:35.732 --> 00:09:37.052]  FBI.
[00:09:37.072 --> 00:09:41.173]  They took real good care of that officer.
[00:09:42.654 --> 00:09:44.474]  But I guess it's okay when they do it.
[00:09:46.155 --> 00:09:49.516]  The officer just knew a little too much and had to be dealt with.
[00:09:50.456 --> 00:09:52.416]  But again, your government's completely trustworthy.
[00:09:52.736 --> 00:09:53.897]  Just go ahead and submit to them.
[00:09:53.957 --> 00:09:56.857]  After all, the new government study says mercury's good for your brain.
[00:09:57.718 --> 00:10:03.219]  By the way, we've got a big medical school up in Canada.
[00:10:04.455 --> 00:10:13.562]  Up in Calgary, a little four-minute video piece about what Mercury does to the brain, the worst heavy metal known for brain interactions.
[00:10:13.643 --> 00:10:20.688]  In fact, to the great folks running the broadcast, I meant to tell you to do this earlier, but it was a wild morning getting ready for the show.
[00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:29.315]  Well, you go to prisonplanet.com, and down at the bottom, I think it's under Multimedia, it says Mercury bad for the brain.
[00:10:30.176 --> 00:10:33.419]  It's like a four- or five-minute video clip on prisonplanet.com.
[00:10:34.764 --> 00:10:47.787]  From the University Medical School, actually with electron microscopes on brain cells that have even had light mercury exposure, the type of exposure you get from injections with your shots.
[00:10:48.367 --> 00:10:49.588]  Will you go record that?
[00:10:49.608 --> 00:10:50.788]  We can play the audio.
[00:10:50.808 --> 00:10:52.728]  I meant to call you earlier today to do that.
[00:10:54.109 --> 00:10:55.349]  If you can't find it, just call...
[00:10:56.198 --> 00:10:59.419]  Paul Watson, he can direct you to it.
[00:10:59.699 --> 00:11:00.080]  I don't know.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.580]  He updates three times a day.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.721]  He may have updated it maybe in yesterday's news by now.
[00:11:06.222 --> 00:11:07.462]  But a little interesting thing.
[00:11:07.502 --> 00:11:15.666]  I mean, I know that they tell you that mercury is now good for your brain, and I'm an extremist because I keep pointing out that, well, thousands of studies say it's not.
[00:11:16.806 --> 00:11:18.827]  But again, you know.
[00:11:19.307 --> 00:11:23.929]  Dollar woes worsen as rival currencies hit new heights.
[00:11:25.354 --> 00:11:32.595]  The dollar had plunged last week, but then it went up in value two cents, almost three cents.
[00:11:32.815 --> 00:11:35.396]  On Monday, it was a big announcement of everything was okay.
[00:11:35.456 --> 00:11:37.716]  It's gone back up several cents.
[00:11:41.897 --> 00:11:45.078]  And so everything is just fine.
[00:11:45.098 --> 00:11:47.058]  In fact, I'm wrong to say that.
[00:11:47.078 --> 00:11:49.178]  It didn't go up several cents.
[00:11:49.258 --> 00:11:53.159]  It went up several percents of a cent.
[00:11:55.545 --> 00:12:00.047]  Well, now it's gone down even more.
[00:12:01.067 --> 00:12:02.208]  This out of AFP.
[00:12:03.148 --> 00:12:08.570]  Dollar lows worsen as rival currencies hit new heights.
[00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:19.514]  The dollar tumbled to new all-time lows against the euro, a 12-year benchmark against sterling and a near five-year benchmark
[00:12:21.261 --> 00:12:25.403]  ...trough against the yen, buckling under the weight of the U.S.
[00:12:25.503 --> 00:12:26.323]  twin deficits.
[00:12:27.203 --> 00:12:38.608]  The single European currency hit a record point of $133.84 in early European trading, topping records set earlier here and in Asia.
[00:12:39.428 --> 00:12:39.488]  The
[00:12:49.756 --> 00:13:02.121]  Yesterday in New York trading, the dollar fell to 101.84 yen, the lowest level since January 2000, before recovering to 102.56.
[00:13:04.422 --> 00:13:19.189]  Sterling also scaled a new 12-year summit against the ailing greenback, breaking above $194 for the first time since September 92, as Finance Minister Gordon Brown prepared to give an annual mini-budget.
[00:13:20.012 --> 00:13:27.755]  Economists see the dollar's decline as inevitable in order to alleviate the massive U.S.
[00:13:27.815 --> 00:13:34.918]  current account and budget deficits by reducing America's appetite for imports and giving a boost to exports.
[00:13:35.418 --> 00:13:45.022]  It was still a dollar weakness story, said Audrey Sheldie Friedman, economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
[00:13:46.557 --> 00:13:54.202]  Adding that the pound, dollar, and euro dollar rates still look like a one-way upward trade.
[00:13:55.903 --> 00:14:07.030]  The euro's seemingly inexorable rise to record highs has set alarm bells ringing in the euro zone where policymakers at the European Central Bank were meeting in Frankfurt in monetary policy.
[00:14:08.011 --> 00:14:09.332]  That's what they say on the surface.
[00:14:09.472 --> 00:14:15.576]  Schroeder and others just said a few weeks ago they think this is good and they're not going to intervene on behalf of the dollar.
[00:14:16.562 --> 00:14:19.123]  They think an 85% reduction would be proper.
[00:14:19.563 --> 00:14:24.305]  We've only seen a 45% reduction so far in the last two years.
[00:14:25.046 --> 00:14:32.088]  A doubling of its drop will basically destroy the economy and cause a world pandemic depression.
[00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:36.870]  A lot of top economists are saying they're dubbing it economic Armageddon.
[00:14:38.251 --> 00:14:41.572]  So we're on the edge of a massive stock market crash at any time.
[00:14:42.012 --> 00:14:43.173]  I'm not saying it's going to happen.
[00:14:43.473 --> 00:14:45.654]  They're saying it could happen, good chance of it.
[00:14:46.363 --> 00:14:52.486]  A total pandemic, a total shutdown, a meltdown, and the globalists will love it.
[00:14:52.506 --> 00:14:56.108]  They're going to have these new make-work jobs that are accompanied by terror attacks.
[00:14:56.629 --> 00:15:02.872]  Instead of building dams, you'll wear little uniforms and run around with tasers and video cameras spying on everyone.
[00:15:03.332 --> 00:15:07.434]  A new age of giants sprawling private prisons and security guard jobs.
[00:15:08.535 --> 00:15:10.656]  The Defense Department think tank says it.
[00:15:12.466 --> 00:15:13.906]  Rand Corporation says it.
[00:15:13.926 --> 00:15:15.527]  They all say this is the new economy.
[00:15:15.887 --> 00:15:27.033]  Prisons, black ski masks, cameras everywhere, tattletale squads everywhere, government paying for your paychecks, and people will support the government because that's how they're going to get paid.
[00:15:28.514 --> 00:15:29.155]  If it happens.
[00:15:31.796 --> 00:15:35.118]  I mean, maybe Japan, who's trying to prop it up, will be successful.
[00:15:35.218 --> 00:15:37.719]  I mean, let's look on the bright side here.
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.881]  This is what happens when you have a fiat currency, though.
[00:15:42.418 --> 00:15:44.780]  And they're pulling the rug out from under us on purpose.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:45.680]  Our own government is.
[00:15:48.061 --> 00:15:49.742]  It's not good for the European citizenry.
[00:15:49.763 --> 00:15:51.123]  It's not good for our citizenry.
[00:15:51.584 --> 00:15:54.205]  It's not good for the little man, little woman, little person.
[00:15:54.525 --> 00:15:57.147]  But it's very good for consolidators.
[00:15:59.261 --> 00:16:07.909]  Because the people that own our debt overseas are the same people that own our Federal Reserve, so they're just jacking up one currency they've got while devaluing another.
[00:16:07.929 --> 00:16:17.898]  And in the process of devaluing that currency, they can take their new super currency and buy up all our real estate in the stock market for pennies on the dollar, especially once it starts dropping.
[00:16:21.001 --> 00:16:25.085]  So it's what the left hand's doing versus the right hand, and
[00:16:27.532 --> 00:16:31.113]  As in all things, it's basically the same little system here.
[00:16:33.134 --> 00:16:33.874]  Some other news.
[00:16:33.954 --> 00:16:34.434]  Mount St.
[00:16:34.474 --> 00:16:39.216]  Helens is the state of Oregon's top polluter, out of the Associated Press.
[00:16:40.176 --> 00:16:56.481]  And again, every time there is a volcanic eruption, a big ash or gas spewer, it puts out more pollution than the entire world produces, that is humans produce, in a year.
[00:16:57.967 --> 00:16:58.167]  St.
[00:16:58.187 --> 00:17:03.509]  Helens' latest eruptions aren't big, so it's just actually the West's biggest polluter.
[00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:06.450]  In fact, I've got the actual scientific study here.
[00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:11.791]  It actually created this year more pollution than all human activity west of the Rockies.
[00:17:13.092 --> 00:17:16.693]  But the AP article focuses in on the state of Washington.
[00:17:17.153 --> 00:17:21.594]  Washington's state top polluter isn't a pulp mill, a power plant, or a refinery.
[00:17:21.994 --> 00:17:23.495]  It's the newly awakened Mount St.
[00:17:23.535 --> 00:17:23.935]  Helens.
[00:17:24.821 --> 00:17:37.544]  Since the volcano began erupting in early October, it has been pumping out 50 to 250 tons a day of sulfur dioxide, the lung-stinging gas that causes acid rain and contributes to haze.
[00:17:38.144 --> 00:17:42.486]  At peak, that's more than double the amount from all the state's industries combined.
[00:17:43.606 --> 00:17:48.247]  Funny, the report here says it's more than the entire West combined, but...
[00:17:49.238 --> 00:17:50.159]  Who knows what's true.
[00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:56.525]  Normally, the state's number one polluter is coal-fired power plant owned by the Canadian firm TransAtlanta.
[00:17:57.306 --> 00:18:07.015]  The plant churned out 200 tons a day of sulfur dioxide until regulations demanded 250 million worth of renovations, bringing the level down to 27 tons a day.
[00:18:07.476 --> 00:18:09.618]  Tough to get those kind of results from a volcano.
[00:18:10.464 --> 00:18:14.406]  Yeah, they should find the volcano, have a UN tax on it.
[00:18:15.026 --> 00:18:16.167]  You can put a cork in it.
[00:18:17.687 --> 00:18:23.610]  You can't put a cork in it, said Greg Northstein of the Western Washington Energy Policy Office.
[00:18:24.891 --> 00:18:27.532]  And just, well, anyways.
[00:18:28.553 --> 00:18:33.795]  Folks, what's bad for the environment is genetic engineering.
[00:18:35.096 --> 00:18:37.877]  You know, splicing humans with cows and goats and pigs.
[00:18:39.065 --> 00:18:42.308]  I don't have any humansies in laboratories in Argentina.
[00:18:42.408 --> 00:18:42.648]  Really.
[00:18:43.329 --> 00:18:44.029]  They're really humans.
[00:18:44.049 --> 00:18:44.890]  They don't have any rights.
[00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:46.652]  They can gut them and take their organs.
[00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:55.519]  We now learn, Washington Post two weeks ago, it's been going on for eight years, putting spider genes in your food and your goats.
[00:18:57.321 --> 00:19:03.406]  Most of the vegetables now you buy actually have bug genes in them because it makes them last longer.
[00:19:03.846 --> 00:19:06.088]  This is the type of stuff that's really dangerous.
[00:19:06.189 --> 00:19:06.569]  Dumping...
[00:19:07.694 --> 00:19:11.735]  Millions of gallons of lead and mercury into the ocean.
[00:19:11.775 --> 00:19:12.636]  There's no law against it.
[00:19:12.676 --> 00:19:13.696]  They just go out and dump it.
[00:19:14.156 --> 00:19:15.156]  That's horrible.
[00:19:15.717 --> 00:19:16.617]  That's unbelievable.
[00:19:16.657 --> 00:19:19.258]  That could kill the earth or really damage it badly.
[00:19:19.858 --> 00:19:21.798]  But the genetic engineering is really what's dangerous.
[00:19:22.359 --> 00:19:28.761]  This stuff about your car being bad and burning some fossil fuel, this stuff, it's a red herring.
[00:19:29.861 --> 00:19:35.943]  When big money got together and had its patent running out on
[00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:43.765]  Preon, they just banned it and made you go to what they had patented.
[00:19:45.186 --> 00:19:50.648]  I mean, literally, they had a thing on about against marijuana the other day on TV and it was Dr. DuPont.
[00:19:51.468 --> 00:19:59.491]  It was a DuPont family doctor saying how bad marijuana is because they're the ones that got it banned to begin with because it's a lot better than the cottons.
[00:20:01.417 --> 00:20:05.018]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[00:20:05.318 --> 00:20:08.858]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[00:20:09.139 --> 00:20:17.980]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial specialists with decades of financial experience who are ready to provide you with state-of-the-art, up-to-date financial services.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:22.261]  Midas Resources offers a host of services and stands behind their products.
[00:20:22.561 --> 00:20:26.782]  In fact, if you call and order their free Midas report, Midas Resources will pay you.

[00:21:02.771 --> 00:21:07.273]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:21:07.613 --> 00:21:11.715]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:21:12.015 --> 00:21:12.555]  We listened.
[00:21:12.855 --> 00:21:17.838]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:21:18.118 --> 00:21:18.598]  We listened.
[00:21:18.978 --> 00:21:22.039]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:22.960]  We listened.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:23.940]  We're good to go.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:24.200]  I think?
[00:21:52.554 --> 00:21:53.016]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[00:21:53.076 --> 00:21:54.019]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:01.309 --> 00:22:03.791]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I've got a gripe.
[00:22:04.171 --> 00:22:07.114]  Recently, construction in my area has doubled my commute time.
[00:22:07.254 --> 00:22:10.917]  I'm spending up to four hours in stop-and-go rush-hour traffic every day.
[00:22:11.097 --> 00:22:13.519]  The worst part is there's no good talk radio to listen to.
[00:22:13.699 --> 00:22:16.942]  But that doesn't matter to me anymore, thanks to the good people at Freeway Radio.
[00:22:17.122 --> 00:22:24.448]  I've got the Sony shortwave car stereo from Freeway Radio, and now I look forward to getting comfortable in my car and hearing the real scoop on the day's news.
[00:22:24.688 --> 00:22:26.388]  It's not just a shortwave radio, though.
[00:22:26.448 --> 00:22:30.269]  You can also get AM and FM, listen to cassette, and control your CD changer.
[00:22:30.389 --> 00:22:32.290]  Call Freeway Radio today, toll-free, 866-404-3600.
[00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:33.190]  That's 1-866-404-3600.
[00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:35.651]  Get your own Sony shortwave car stereo today for only $189.
[00:22:35.791 --> 00:22:37.431]  Install it in the boat, the RV, or your car.
[00:22:44.073 --> 00:22:48.515]  The good news for us is that you'll have GCN programming and crystal clear radio wherever you go.
[00:22:48.615 --> 00:22:53.717]  Don't get me wrong, I'd still rather be golfing than sitting in traffic, but freeway radio has eased my commute immensely.
[00:22:53.797 --> 00:22:58.779]  Call them today at 1-866-404-3600 and let them do the same for you.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.381]  Those dark, depressing days are here.
[00:23:05.081 --> 00:23:08.542]  Are you among the 15% of North Americans who suffer from the winter blues?
[00:23:09.163 --> 00:23:12.664]  This condition is simply caused by the lack of sunlight during the short winter days.
[00:23:13.365 --> 00:23:15.947]  Do you suffer from constant fatigue and lack of energy?
[00:23:15.967 --> 00:23:18.788]  Do you have a hard time pulling yourself out of bed in the morning?
[00:23:19.309 --> 00:23:20.730]  Do you put on weight in the winter?
[00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:23.151]  Is your life on hold till the spring?
[00:23:23.711 --> 00:23:24.652]  Check with your doctor.
[00:23:24.772 --> 00:23:29.675]  You may be suffering from the winter blues or from SAD, seasonal affective disorder.
[00:23:30.135 --> 00:23:34.858]  In all likelihood, your doctor will recommend bright light therapy with one of our special lights.
[00:23:35.519 --> 00:23:36.359]  Light up your life.
[00:23:36.459 --> 00:23:39.161]  Put some sunshine on your depressing days with the northern lights.
[00:23:39.693 --> 00:23:54.391]  Call Northern Light Technologies at 800-263-0066 and speak to one of our trained representatives or visit us at northernlighttechnologies.com That's northernlighttechnologies.com Our phone number again is 800-263-0066
[00:24:12.638 --> 00:24:18.222]  Finishing up what I was saying, here on television is Dr. DuPont of the DuPont family.
[00:24:18.883 --> 00:24:21.165]  Why marijuana is the most deadly thing on earth.
[00:24:21.205 --> 00:24:28.030]  Well, they got it banned in this country because most of the varieties don't even have THC in it that'll get you, quote, high.
[00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:31.192]  It's because it's better than cotton, but forget cotton.
[00:24:32.333 --> 00:24:38.878]  They were mad at it because it made a better fabric and a better oil than...
[00:24:39.699 --> 00:24:44.643]  Petrol, you know, out of the ground, fossil fuel does for things like polyester.
[00:24:46.545 --> 00:24:47.966]  And so they're back on TV.
[00:24:48.026 --> 00:24:49.647]  This is devil weed.
[00:24:49.767 --> 00:24:52.390]  It will, it's just, I'm Dr. DuPont, by the way.
[00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:55.112]  Well, it's the same thing with cars.
[00:24:56.693 --> 00:25:04.880]  And again, I'm all for new technologies and new fuels and things, but if you think your car is anything even close to volcanoes,
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:10.281]  In what all the cars on the planet are able to put out, you've got another thing coming.
[00:25:10.601 --> 00:25:22.563]  Now, what is a problem is in Africa and Mexico and all these places where they openly smelt the batteries down that have been used and all these other chemicals, and then it just drifts on the jet stream endlessly around the world.
[00:25:22.583 --> 00:25:26.084]  I mean, there are big problems.
[00:25:26.364 --> 00:25:32.405]  But most of the environmental moves the government pushes are written by the corporations to consolidate control.
[00:25:33.556 --> 00:25:38.460]  And if you worry about something that could kill the planet or really hurt it, it's genetic engineering.
[00:25:40.301 --> 00:25:41.902]  But, of course, you'll never hear that in the news.
[00:25:42.883 --> 00:25:46.065]  Brokhoff signs off last night from NBC Nightly News.
[00:25:46.325 --> 00:25:46.886]  Who cares?
[00:25:47.706 --> 00:25:51.669]  For 23 years, the guy read off a teleprompter.
[00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:54.771]  Yes, they've had teleprompters for over 23 years.
[00:25:56.016 --> 00:26:00.897]  Now, Dan Rather is going to be signing off next year, 30 plus years in the job.
[00:26:01.778 --> 00:26:07.199]  Well, that old boy, he actually was from the old day of where they'd stand there with cue cards for him.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.641]  I mean, boy, Tom Brokaw, what a man, what a leader.
[00:26:11.681 --> 00:26:18.803]  He read off a teleprompter in a fancy suit, and he looked you in the eye for 23 years, so you think he's real powerful.
[00:26:20.483 --> 00:26:22.524]  I mean, who cares?
[00:26:25.649 --> 00:26:27.211]  These people are mental midgets.
[00:26:28.112 --> 00:26:36.961]  Martyrs who fail to register for ID cards face 2,500 pound fines, or $5,000 fine.
[00:26:37.001 --> 00:26:43.067]  This is how the London Independent... And guess what?
[00:26:43.107 --> 00:26:43.388]  This is...
[00:26:47.293 --> 00:26:58.123]  The British Prime Minister Tony Blair said, we're putting the National ID card in, and any of you that don't do it are going to be fined $5,000 or 2,500 pounds.
[00:27:00.105 --> 00:27:04.429]  And it actually says in the article that foreigners don't have to have one.
[00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:06.090]  I love it!
[00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:06.711]  I love it!
[00:27:07.371 --> 00:27:07.812]  I love it!
[00:27:08.873 --> 00:27:12.616]  We've got to do this to stop the evil Arabs while they're going to kill us any minute.
[00:27:13.334 --> 00:27:15.796]  But the Arabs are exempt.
[00:27:16.137 --> 00:27:17.258]  Anybody else for that matter.
[00:27:17.818 --> 00:27:24.284]  If you're in the country less than three months, obviously that'd be the so-called terrorist, you don't have to have your national ID card.
[00:27:24.784 --> 00:27:25.745]  And here's our comment.
[00:27:26.305 --> 00:27:38.376]  Even if you believe the government was really introducing this protect us from the terrorist legislation, the only people who won't have to take the card are foreigners who are in the country less than three months, the terrorist.
[00:27:39.247 --> 00:27:40.788]  And then it gets into that in the article.
[00:27:41.028 --> 00:27:50.331]  People who refuse to register with the Plan National Identity Cards database will be fined 2,500 pounds, the government said yesterday.
[00:27:50.931 --> 00:28:00.134]  There will also be penalties of 1,000 pounds for those who fail to renew their ID cards or forget to update their details when they move homes.
[00:28:00.674 --> 00:28:06.756]  The fines will be levied when it becomes compulsory to cooperate with the controversial ID card scheme
[00:28:08.974 --> 00:28:20.919]  And it says, polls saying 20% of the public oppose the plans, and the anti-ID card groups claiming to be signing hundreds of new supporters daily raises the prospect 20%?
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:25.841]  We've posted BBC polls where it was 90 plus percent.
[00:28:26.241 --> 00:28:30.363]  What is this new thing of only 20% don't want to have to have a national ID card?
[00:28:32.136 --> 00:28:37.978]  Bill Booth, spokesman for the group No to IDs, said the penalties are outrageous.
[00:28:38.038 --> 00:28:39.579]  Millions of people oppose the plans.
[00:28:39.859 --> 00:28:42.480]  People are telling us that they would rather go to prison than sign up.
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:46.582]  Of course, here in America, they don't even tell you you're going to have a national ID card.
[00:28:46.882 --> 00:28:50.103]  They just federally standardized the driver's license over a decade ago.
[00:28:50.863 --> 00:28:54.485]  Now, 11 years ago, almost every state follows it to get their highway funds.
[00:28:54.905 --> 00:28:57.246]  Now they're just going to make it the law in the next month.
[00:28:57.266 --> 00:28:58.106]  They're trying to pass it.
[00:28:58.146 --> 00:28:59.347]  They failed two weeks ago.
[00:29:00.126 --> 00:29:04.427]  Make it the law where you have to have this, or you can't have a job or anything.
[00:29:06.448 --> 00:29:08.309]  Oh man, there's so much other news here.
[00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:12.570]  But we got a guest coming up, and then later China blocks Google News site.
[00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:16.871]  But see, Google created a clone for China that already censors.
[00:29:17.592 --> 00:29:21.013]  So now they block the old Google, so they have to use the commie Google.
[00:29:22.253 --> 00:29:23.334]  Shame on Google.
[00:29:23.414 --> 00:29:24.634]  Everybody should contact them.
[00:29:25.074 --> 00:29:27.655]  We should start using, I guess, other big search engines.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:32.481]  Shame, shame, shame, shame, shame, shame, shame.
[00:29:33.081 --> 00:29:33.481]  Google.
[00:29:34.682 --> 00:29:35.242]  Boogly Google.
[00:29:36.582 --> 00:29:38.743]  We'll be back with our guest.
[00:29:38.803 --> 00:29:39.904]  You do not want to miss this guest.
[00:29:39.944 --> 00:29:42.465]  We've got another incredible guest coming out in the middle of the next hour.
[00:29:44.185 --> 00:29:46.066]  presentplanet.tv, folks.
[00:29:46.506 --> 00:29:48.186]  It's the new and improved website.
[00:29:48.227 --> 00:29:48.687]  Check it out.
[00:29:48.707 --> 00:29:50.107]  A lot of new stuff there.
[00:29:51.448 --> 00:29:52.368]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.848 --> 00:29:54.469]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.369 --> 00:29:58.050]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.397 --> 00:30:05.361]  Are you concerned about the quality of air and purity of water in your household?
[00:30:05.821 --> 00:30:12.867]  If you answered yes, then you owe it to yourself and your family to check out the amazing benefits of owning your own personal ozone generator.
[00:30:13.247 --> 00:30:17.371]  With an ozone generator, you can kill bacteria and viruses in your drinking water.
[00:30:17.871 --> 00:30:21.134]  Get rid of that stale air in your house that keeps recirculating.
[00:30:21.514 --> 00:30:26.356]  Your new ozone generator will remove odors and provide a clean, fresh scent throughout your house.
[00:30:26.816 --> 00:30:31.478]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises for one of the most affordable ozone generators available today.
[00:30:31.898 --> 00:30:35.080]  That number is 800-569-4340.
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:44.243]  The ozone generator is portable, has an internal blower for ozone disbursement into the air, and comes with a tube attachment for ozonating liquids.
[00:30:44.623 --> 00:30:45.964]  Best of all, it's affordable.
[00:30:46.344 --> 00:30:49.926]  It's only $385 and that includes the shipping.
[00:30:50.366 --> 00:30:59.571]  So call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340 for your personal ozone generator or visit on the web at cliffscott.com.
[00:31:01.212 --> 00:31:04.775]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:04.815 --> 00:31:05.335]  are located?
[00:31:05.535 --> 00:31:08.917]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:31:09.138 --> 00:31:13.861]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:02.581]  By now, you've heard about DirecTV.
[00:32:02.781 --> 00:32:10.686]  You've heard that with DirecTV, you get a better value than cable, a better selection than cable, and access to exclusive programming that you can't get anywhere else.
[00:32:10.906 --> 00:32:13.147]  But for whatever reason, you thought there was a catch.
[00:32:13.427 --> 00:32:14.968]  Maybe even hidden fees.
[00:32:15.208 --> 00:32:16.829]  Well, expert satellite can help.
[00:32:17.069 --> 00:32:19.190]  And we've done it for hundreds of thousands already.
[00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:23.893]  Just give us a call at 1-800-655-0658.
[00:32:24.373 --> 00:32:27.975]  Within seconds, we'll compare DirecTV to your cable bill right over the phone.
[00:32:28.155 --> 00:32:28.695]  We're good to go.
[00:32:58.095 --> 00:32:59.415]  All right, folks.
[00:32:59.455 --> 00:33:10.839]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:27.401 --> 00:33:29.482]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:30.363 --> 00:33:32.684]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central.
[00:33:33.645 --> 00:33:37.787]  Back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:33:38.267 --> 00:33:39.448]  Coming up here in a minute or two.
[00:33:41.469 --> 00:33:45.071]  Lawyer, FBI likely knew of Oklahoma City bombing plot.
[00:33:45.172 --> 00:33:49.054]  Likely, and Mr. Prenadu has come to the right place.
[00:33:49.154 --> 00:33:50.835]  We know exactly what happened.
[00:33:51.963 --> 00:33:54.724]  You've been studying it since it happened, covering it since it happened.
[00:33:55.224 --> 00:33:56.844]  Made two films on the subject.
[00:33:57.285 --> 00:33:59.965]  Lawyer sues FBI over brother's death.
[00:34:01.166 --> 00:34:08.068]  They're being posted as we speak, the grisly photos of his brother's dead body.
[00:34:08.208 --> 00:34:09.428]  And we're posting them.
[00:34:09.948 --> 00:34:10.969]  He's authorized to.
[00:34:10.989 --> 00:34:11.669]  You need to see this.
[00:34:11.709 --> 00:34:12.829]  He's not the only person.
[00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:17.011]  Police officers and others were murdered in similar fashion.
[00:34:18.091 --> 00:34:21.592]  They'd be found tortured, stabbed, bloody handcuff marks.
[00:34:23.248 --> 00:34:29.592]  There'd be signs of scuffles where they'd run from people, and then the medical examiners would say, Oh, it's suicide!
[00:34:29.612 --> 00:34:32.053]  So that's coming up in a few minutes.
[00:34:32.893 --> 00:34:42.518]  Before we go any further, speaking of Oklahoma City, my film 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, shows the admissions where the U.S.
[00:34:42.538 --> 00:34:48.982]  government planned an Operation Northwoods to hijack jets by remote control and crash them and blame it on foreign enemies.
[00:34:49.722 --> 00:34:51.623]  The Gulf of Tonkin incident never happening.
[00:34:52.712 --> 00:35:00.418]  As well, in Southeast Asia in 1964, we get into Hitler blowing up his own Reichstag to blame it on his enemies.
[00:35:01.299 --> 00:35:05.422]  Then we get to the first World Trade Center bombing, where the FBI cooked the bomb and trained the drivers.
[00:35:05.442 --> 00:35:07.483]  Chicago Tribune, New York Times, eyewitnesses.
[00:35:09.345 --> 00:35:20.133]  We then go to Oklahoma City, April 19, 1995, and show the police saying the BATF was told not to be in the building, the seismographs, the eyewitnesses, all of it.
[00:35:21.132 --> 00:35:23.033]  And then we spent 40 minutes on that.
[00:35:23.073 --> 00:35:23.853]  Then we get into 9-11.
[00:35:24.013 --> 00:35:25.834]  Spent another 40 minutes on that.
[00:35:26.234 --> 00:35:28.675]  That's why the film is almost three hours long.
[00:35:30.575 --> 00:35:32.416]  And so you need to get this film.
[00:35:32.436 --> 00:35:35.557]  That's why my film's different than all the other 9-11 videos out there.
[00:35:35.797 --> 00:35:37.118]  Because it goes through the history of it.
[00:35:37.438 --> 00:35:40.619]  Example after example after example after example after example.
[00:35:40.859 --> 00:35:43.440]  The Russians carrying out bombings to blame it on their enemies.
[00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:46.901]  Just example after example in the film.
[00:35:48.101 --> 00:35:49.482]  And that's why it's so convincing.
[00:35:50.268 --> 00:35:53.389]  A 90% wake-up rate with 9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[00:35:53.749 --> 00:36:04.111]  Then we have part two of that, The Masters of Terror Exposed, that spends about an hour and 50 minutes on 9-11, and then the rest on the police state.
[00:36:04.131 --> 00:36:08.292]  So it focuses more just on 9-11 with more in-depth info on that.
[00:36:09.372 --> 00:36:16.933]  We also carry George Humphrey's 9-11 video, 9-11, The Great Illusion, and Eric Huffman's 9-11, Painful Deceptions.
[00:36:17.013 --> 00:36:17.894]  We have that video.
[00:36:18.154 --> 00:36:19.914]  His book as well, Painful Deceptions.
[00:36:20.943 --> 00:36:38.957]  You can get four 9-11 videos, my two 9-11 videos, the other two 9-11 videos we carry, and Paul Watson's Order Out of Chaos, a leak-sponsored terror in the New World Order, just until December 20th for $59.95, a $53 discount.
[00:36:38.977 --> 00:36:44.402]  You can get Road to Tyranny for $5.95 when you buy one copy for the regular price.
[00:36:45.002 --> 00:36:46.984]  Same thing with my new film, American Dictators.
[00:36:48.624 --> 00:36:51.225]  And I'd order now, so you get them in time to give them as gifts.
[00:36:52.105 --> 00:36:57.407]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order via the SafeSecure online shopping card.
[00:36:58.688 --> 00:36:59.648]  Or call toll-free.
[00:36:59.668 --> 00:37:01.309]  When you call, you can ask about the specials.
[00:37:01.329 --> 00:37:01.949]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:37:01.969 --> 00:37:06.891]  Why battle the crowds buying fruitcakes and George Foreman, you know...
[00:37:15.623 --> 00:37:19.986]  Barbecue kits nobody's going to use, and ties nobody's going to wear.
[00:37:20.326 --> 00:37:22.168]  Why not get the films and get them out to people?
[00:37:22.188 --> 00:37:23.809]  1-888-253-3139, or just write to me.
[00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:26.531]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:37:26.811 --> 00:37:30.714]  And you don't have to buy a bunch of copies of these to give them as gifts.
[00:37:30.774 --> 00:37:33.096]  You want to give somebody a nice gift, do that.
[00:37:39.933 --> 00:37:42.134]  You can get one copy and make 100 copies.
[00:37:42.154 --> 00:37:43.734]  I don't care if you make copies of my videos.
[00:37:44.174 --> 00:37:45.974]  Want to give somebody a burned copy of it?
[00:37:46.574 --> 00:37:47.115]  I don't care.
[00:37:47.575 --> 00:37:48.155]  Please do it.
[00:37:48.175 --> 00:37:48.995]  In fact, I want you to.
[00:37:50.555 --> 00:37:57.277]  But folks like the nice shrink wrap, the color cover, the imprint on the top of the DVD, or the VHS.
[00:37:58.237 --> 00:38:07.019]  Going to our guest, who I appreciate his courage going public on this, it's now kind of a public secret, kind of like the CIA bringing in the drugs, and everybody knows it.
[00:38:07.777 --> 00:38:08.778]  And I'll just say it.
[00:38:08.798 --> 00:38:11.359]  The government didn't know and let somebody bomb the building.
[00:38:11.779 --> 00:38:18.303]  They did it to bring in the police state and the Anti-Terrorism Act and all the rest of it.
[00:38:18.923 --> 00:38:28.849]  But Jesse Trentadue is a prominent lawyer, and his brother was killed, he believes, in connection to knowing too much.
[00:38:29.469 --> 00:38:31.330]  And, sir, it's good to have you on with us.
[00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:32.491]  It's nice to be on, sir.
[00:38:33.807 --> 00:38:39.750]  Just in a nutshell for those that just joined us, tell us about yourself, how you woke up, what you believe happened to your brother.
[00:38:41.451 --> 00:38:45.353]  Well, my brother and I, we're from West Virginia, a close family.
[00:38:45.993 --> 00:38:52.656]  My brother was murdered because he fit the description of John Doe II.
[00:38:53.296 --> 00:38:57.639]  The government was heavily involved in a sting operation with McVeigh and the folks.
[00:38:57.979 --> 00:38:59.639]  They knew that he was going to blow up the building.
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:02.721]  They had an informant in there with them.
[00:39:04.052 --> 00:39:10.477]  I think that in my case, I have fought the government now for almost 10 years trying to get to the truth.
[00:39:11.377 --> 00:39:24.527]  And recently I've come across a couple of memos, and I don't know if anyone's ever seen them before, that are pretty significant that seem to me to indicate that the government was there and killed my brother because he was John Doe II.
[00:39:24.867 --> 00:39:26.628]  Well, he wasn't John Doe II, but they thought he was.
[00:39:27.509 --> 00:39:30.411]  Were you aware that police officers and people were killed?
[00:39:30.891 --> 00:39:33.213]  I've been contacted by a family of an officer that told me.
[00:39:33.812 --> 00:39:36.914]  Well, we've had the investigating police officers on this show.
[00:39:38.796 --> 00:39:41.418]  He was called and said, I'm being followed by FBI guys.
[00:39:41.938 --> 00:39:46.122]  I've got the documents proving they were involved.
[00:39:46.862 --> 00:39:47.883]  And he never got home.
[00:39:47.923 --> 00:39:54.308]  They pulled him over, handcuffed him, stabbed him 13 times, tortured the living daylights out of him, and then murdered him.
[00:39:55.389 --> 00:39:56.950]  And there were other people, too.
[00:39:57.891 --> 00:40:00.353]  Perhaps I should get you in contact with those folks.
[00:40:01.134 --> 00:40:04.836]  Well, I've got my fight with the government on my brother, and that's about all I can handle.
[00:40:05.257 --> 00:40:07.158]  Well, it just shows more evidence.
[00:40:07.518 --> 00:40:09.280]  It does, and it is terrible.
[00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:17.586]  Well, now, I know that from reading over your documents, you're concerned with the Elohim-City connection.
[00:40:20.668 --> 00:40:25.612]  Yes, what happened is, before he was executed, Tim McVeigh sent me word that
[00:40:27.325 --> 00:40:30.986]  My brother had been killed by the government because they thought he was Richard Lee Guthrie.
[00:40:32.407 --> 00:40:34.687]  He has remarkable resemblance to Guthrie.
[00:40:36.348 --> 00:40:43.070]  Okay, well let's... Just for people to understand this, tell us about your brother, how he was involved on the periphery of all this.
[00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:44.330]  What happened to him?
[00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.770]  He wasn't involved.
[00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:46.991]  Well, I'm not saying involved.
[00:40:47.011 --> 00:40:48.931]  I mean, you know, there in the area looking like him.
[00:40:49.471 --> 00:40:51.972]  On the periphery, how he got sucked in the black hole.
[00:40:52.312 --> 00:40:53.153]  Well, what happened is he...
[00:40:57.379 --> 00:40:59.860]  He had been a bank robber when he was young.
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.600]  When he got all the service, he had been a drug addict.
[00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.921]  He eventually robbed banks to support that habit.
[00:41:06.101 --> 00:41:11.222]  He went to jail, did his time, fled guilty, got out, married.
[00:41:14.683 --> 00:41:22.405]  At the time he was picked up, the description that was out for John Doe II was white male, powerful upper body build, 5'9",
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:26.262]  So we have the admission that he was in custody.
[00:41:54.102 --> 00:41:54.342]  Yes.
[00:41:55.303 --> 00:41:57.925]  And we have these gruesome photos of his dead body.
[00:41:57.965 --> 00:42:00.747]  I mean, the bloody handcuff marks, the torture marks.
[00:42:01.027 --> 00:42:01.868]  His throat was slashed.
[00:42:02.869 --> 00:42:04.290]  And then they say he committed suicide.
[00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.890]  By hanging.
[00:42:07.172 --> 00:42:08.313]  All the evidence disappeared.
[00:42:08.973 --> 00:42:12.156]  The FBI undressed him and threw his bloodstained clothing away.
[00:42:12.796 --> 00:42:14.758]  They would not let the medical examiner into the cell.
[00:42:14.798 --> 00:42:15.338]  They cleaned it.
[00:42:15.842 --> 00:42:18.203]  All the logbooks that would show who was there disappeared.
[00:42:18.663 --> 00:42:21.003]  If the logbook didn't disappear, the pages disappeared.
[00:42:21.423 --> 00:42:23.404]  The photographs of the crime scene disappeared.
[00:42:23.604 --> 00:42:25.864]  The negatives of the crime scene photographs disappeared.
[00:42:26.284 --> 00:42:28.405]  The videotapes of the crime scene disappeared.
[00:42:29.245 --> 00:42:30.185]  Everything disappeared.
[00:42:30.685 --> 00:42:32.266]  And they tried to cremate my brother's body.
[00:42:33.186 --> 00:42:38.387]  Yeah, and by your brother's involvement, I meant like a little old lady walks out in the street and gets hit by a Mack truck.
[00:42:38.427 --> 00:42:41.187]  I meant how did he intersect in the story?
[00:42:41.307 --> 00:42:42.808]  He just had the misfortune to be...
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:45.841]  To the profile they were looking for.
[00:42:45.861 --> 00:42:54.888]  Yeah, now... And that's why I got drawn into the Elohim City in Guthrie and McVeigh.
[00:42:55.388 --> 00:42:57.710]  At the time we tried the lawsuit, we never had a motive.
[00:42:59.051 --> 00:43:00.993]  I mean, people said, well, why would they do this?
[00:43:01.653 --> 00:43:02.834]  And I didn't have an explanation.
[00:43:02.954 --> 00:43:06.137]  How did McVeigh, Timothy McVeigh, contact you?
[00:43:06.577 --> 00:43:07.798]  Sent me word to another inmate.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:19.126]  Yeah, let me just tell you, I need to get you on the phone with some police officers and investigators I trust, because I'm going to tell you, the Elohim City thing is a rabbit trail.
[00:43:19.886 --> 00:43:26.451]  There were Iraqi Republican Guard with McVeigh as part of a government so-called terror drill op.
[00:43:26.571 --> 00:43:30.733]  McVeigh was actually special forces that had gone into covert operations.
[00:43:30.833 --> 00:43:33.195]  We even have the video, sir, of these people on the ground.
[00:43:33.715 --> 00:43:37.698]  I'm sure you know there were all those surveillance camera tapes showing all this, and the FBI sees those.
[00:43:38.562 --> 00:43:41.404]  We've interviewed the police and others that have seen those videos.
[00:43:41.804 --> 00:43:46.027]  The FBI has been on record to the LA Times saying, yes, those videos do exist.
[00:43:46.067 --> 00:43:57.735]  What McVeigh was doing is, he was going around the country to every militia group, going to Waco, saying he was mad about Waco, going everywhere, creating a ledger, creating a history.
[00:43:58.263 --> 00:43:59.343]  This is what the government will do.
[00:43:59.363 --> 00:44:09.686]  They'll run a covert op, and the people in the covert op think they're part of a drill or part of surveillance, and then the government actually carries out an operation and then burns them in the process.
[00:44:13.547 --> 00:44:20.069]  Well, I'm not familiar with that, but I do know that McVeigh was, at least from those documents, it looks as though he knew those folks at Elohim City.
[00:44:20.289 --> 00:44:21.409]  Oh, no, he's certainly been there.
[00:44:21.969 --> 00:44:25.090]  And Andre Strossmeier, obviously a government informant,
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:26.601]  I would appreciate that.
[00:44:47.648 --> 00:44:48.668]  Well, this is just horrible.
[00:44:48.708 --> 00:44:51.129]  I mean, these photos, it's completely obvious.
[00:44:52.129 --> 00:44:52.769]  He was tortured.
[00:44:53.249 --> 00:45:05.392]  For those that aren't online, that can't go to Infowars.com, for those that can't link through to some of the news sites that have covered what you're showing, and the memos, describe the photos for us.
[00:45:05.412 --> 00:45:07.233]  I know it's hard for you to do, sir, but please do that.
[00:45:07.793 --> 00:45:08.313]  We took them.
[00:45:09.914 --> 00:45:11.514]  As I said, they tried to cremate his body.
[00:45:11.554 --> 00:45:15.295]  When he arrived home, he was heavily made up, so none of the injuries showed.
[00:45:16.164 --> 00:45:21.030]  But we knew that if Kenneth had been murdered, he would go down fighting.
[00:45:22.031 --> 00:45:23.913]  And we expected to see him beaten to a pulp.
[00:45:24.113 --> 00:45:29.960]  So he was heavily made up and... All the wounds were concealed.
[00:45:30.881 --> 00:45:32.703]  And so you had to remove makeup.
[00:45:32.843 --> 00:45:35.326]  Yes, my mother, my sister, and Kenneth's wife.
[00:45:36.184 --> 00:45:40.126]  We took off his clothing, took off the makeup, and photographed the body.
[00:45:40.146 --> 00:45:41.307]  You know, that had to be painful.
[00:45:41.327 --> 00:45:50.632]  My grandmother died earlier this year, and just to go in and view the body when she was at the morgue, it's somebody you love.
[00:45:50.672 --> 00:45:51.053]  It's hard.
[00:45:51.093 --> 00:45:53.594]  I couldn't imagine spending hours doing that.
[00:45:53.614 --> 00:45:54.435]  It must have been painful.
[00:45:55.015 --> 00:46:00.158]  Well, fortunately we did because we have the only photographs, basically.
[00:46:00.378 --> 00:46:03.640]  The government, those photographs disappeared, supposedly.
[00:46:04.375 --> 00:46:07.416]  Now, it looks like your brother went through a lot of torture.
[00:46:07.596 --> 00:46:07.977]  He did.
[00:46:08.357 --> 00:46:11.858]  He was beaten literally front to back, head to toe.
[00:46:12.399 --> 00:46:14.900]  His head was smashed in three places all the way to the skull.
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:17.601]  They had been hit so hard that the skin had ruptured to the skull.
[00:46:18.121 --> 00:46:19.122]  His throat was slashed.
[00:46:20.102 --> 00:46:21.483]  His face was beaten to a pulp.
[00:46:21.563 --> 00:46:24.624]  You can see stun gun burns all over his temples and his body.
[00:46:25.304 --> 00:46:27.645]  Front, back, even the soles of his feet had been beaten.
[00:46:27.665 --> 00:46:31.567]  They had taken a long time to kill him.
[00:46:34.602 --> 00:46:35.883]  Why so much pleasure?
[00:46:35.903 --> 00:46:37.363]  I mean, how does that tie in?
[00:46:37.703 --> 00:46:39.724]  I think they were looking for information that he didn't have.
[00:46:39.744 --> 00:46:44.586]  That's the only thing I can think of.
[00:46:45.666 --> 00:46:49.808]  You think it was stupid cowboys in the FBI that didn't know their bosses had pulled off the bombing?
[00:46:49.828 --> 00:46:56.310]  Or do you think they were trying to get him to reveal if he'd talked to anybody?
[00:46:58.111 --> 00:47:03.373]  It'd be speculation on my part, but I think they were afraid he might be the person they were looking for and they wanted to know what he'd told anybody.
[00:47:06.775 --> 00:47:08.096]  I mean, in the end, they killed him.
[00:47:09.458 --> 00:47:14.883]  But they didn't do... I mean, they systematically tortured him and then strangled him.
[00:47:18.646 --> 00:47:20.228]  Well, yeah, we've got the photos.
[00:47:20.468 --> 00:47:21.449]  He's pretty grisly.
[00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:24.512]  And he was strangled with a pair of plastic handcuffs.
[00:47:26.594 --> 00:47:28.055]  And then what was the throat slitting?
[00:47:28.856 --> 00:47:29.777]  I don't know why they did that.
[00:47:34.346 --> 00:47:35.127]  They didn't slice him.
[00:47:35.227 --> 00:47:36.408]  It wasn't deep enough to kill him.
[00:47:36.448 --> 00:47:38.309]  It was just cut.
[00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:39.349]  You've seen the photographs.
[00:47:39.389 --> 00:47:40.710]  I think the cut is a huge cut.
[00:47:41.571 --> 00:47:41.831]  Yes.
[00:47:41.891 --> 00:47:43.492]  Just below the ear and it goes to the front.
[00:47:46.814 --> 00:47:51.657]  Yeah, sometimes expert torturers do that to show somebody in the mirror.
[00:47:53.398 --> 00:47:56.900]  They could have done that to scare him and show him how serious they were?
[00:47:57.761 --> 00:47:58.201]  I don't know.
[00:47:58.861 --> 00:47:59.662]  And on top of that...
[00:48:01.336 --> 00:48:09.281]  They had fed him massive doses of caffeine within an hour of death, which... Yeah, that sounds like CIA activity.
[00:48:09.301 --> 00:48:10.983]  That sounds like copper green training.
[00:48:11.563 --> 00:48:14.005]  That was to enhance the pain.
[00:48:14.685 --> 00:48:17.347]  Yeah.
[00:48:17.387 --> 00:48:18.728]  That's a handbook.
[00:48:18.748 --> 00:48:20.269]  There's actually a handbook on that.
[00:48:20.569 --> 00:48:27.073]  He had consumed within an hour and a half of death the equivalent of 30 bottles of Coca-Cola and caffeine.
[00:48:29.085 --> 00:48:30.846]  Really get those neurons firing.
[00:48:32.527 --> 00:48:37.069]  This wasn't something where they just explode in rage and kill him.
[00:48:37.089 --> 00:48:39.010]  This was systematic and this was thought out.
[00:48:39.651 --> 00:48:42.252]  They said the stun gun burns are on his spine.
[00:48:42.552 --> 00:48:46.034]  Well, you've got in record, though, who picked him up and then where he was transferred to.
[00:48:46.094 --> 00:48:49.996]  You at least know the names of the creatures that were frequenting the area.
[00:48:50.156 --> 00:48:52.597]  Do you have any idea who murdered your brother?
[00:48:52.937 --> 00:48:53.998]  The log books disappeared.
[00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:58.882]  The surveillance cameras supposedly didn't work.
[00:49:00.083 --> 00:49:01.084]  No, they never do, yeah.
[00:49:01.424 --> 00:49:07.569]  He was supposedly in protective custody in an isolated part of the institution, away from everyone.
[00:49:12.133 --> 00:49:12.814]  Unbelievable.
[00:49:13.214 --> 00:49:18.158]  And then when you first learned of this and when you first got the body, what made you want to check it?
[00:49:19.139 --> 00:49:20.560]  We knew what kind of man Kenny was.
[00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:21.361]  Kenny was a good man.
[00:49:22.515 --> 00:49:24.436]  If he committed suicide, there wouldn't be a mark on him.
[00:49:24.576 --> 00:49:26.836]  But if somebody murdered him, we know he would go down fighting.
[00:49:28.097 --> 00:49:29.177]  And he would take a lot of killing.
[00:49:30.438 --> 00:49:33.199]  And if you look at his knuckles, you can see how black and bruised they are.
[00:49:33.219 --> 00:49:40.081]  I mean, he put up a fight until he was overcome and then tortured.
[00:49:43.062 --> 00:49:46.823]  And I received a call about six months after he died.
[00:49:46.883 --> 00:49:50.925]  An anonymous call that at the time I didn't pay much attention to.
[00:49:51.145 --> 00:49:51.825]  The caller said,
[00:49:52.651 --> 00:49:58.253]  That your brother had been killed by the FBI because he did a profile.
[00:49:58.913 --> 00:49:59.753]  I said, what profile?
[00:49:59.813 --> 00:50:06.955]  He said, well, of a Midwest bank robbery gang, people who were robbing banks to fund attacks against the federal government.
[00:50:07.656 --> 00:50:11.197]  Of course, I thought this was lunacy, and I just dismissed it.
[00:50:11.257 --> 00:50:17.039]  Then about six, seven months later, I read in the Los Angeles Times where Richard Lee Guthrie
[00:50:19.318 --> 00:50:25.142]  A member of the Midwest Bankruptcy Gang is found hanging in his cell, just like my brother, while in federal custody.
[00:50:25.862 --> 00:50:27.143]  And under the custody of the FBI.
[00:50:29.825 --> 00:50:32.246]  And Mr. Jones, I had one eyewitness to my brother's murder.
[00:50:32.467 --> 00:50:33.267]  Guess what happened to him?
[00:50:34.268 --> 00:50:34.808]  What happened?
[00:50:35.188 --> 00:50:36.669]  Found him hanging in his cell, too.
[00:50:37.930 --> 00:50:39.471]  Just before the trial was to start.
[00:50:42.233 --> 00:50:42.653]  Stay there.
[00:50:42.733 --> 00:50:43.434]  We're talking to...
[00:50:44.497 --> 00:50:49.399]  Jesse Trentadeau, the lawyer, brother of the man who was obviously murdered.
[00:50:49.419 --> 00:50:53.361]  I mean, it's... Go look at the photos at Infowars.com.
[00:50:54.901 --> 00:50:56.322]  Give you some other websites as well.
[00:50:56.342 --> 00:50:57.803]  We'll be back, get more into this story.
[00:50:57.823 --> 00:50:58.263]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.275 --> 00:51:05.621]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.801 --> 00:51:10.227]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.368 --> 00:51:14.774]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.814 --> 00:51:16.155]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.917 --> 00:51:22.140]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:29.146]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act Legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.266 --> 00:51:31.347]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.507 --> 00:51:42.016]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.276 --> 00:51:45.999]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video,
[00:51:46.459 --> 00:51:46.539]  888-253-3139.
[00:51:46.619 --> 00:51:48.240]  Order today and spread the word.

[00:52:05.703 --> 00:52:10.164]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[00:52:10.324 --> 00:52:24.348]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey light water purifier, an LED base, two Berkey sport filtration bottles, the Berkey battery adapter, the Berkey MP solar charger, as well as a backup set of two black Berkey purification elements.
[00:52:24.588 --> 00:52:43.776]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies and cell phones, as well as power for small applications.

[00:52:47.758 --> 00:52:50.399]  The Berkey Security Pack, a retail value of $518 for only $399.
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:53.760]  We're good to go.
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:54.301]  I think?
[00:53:17.196 --> 00:53:17.856]  We're good to go.
[00:53:39.827 --> 00:53:40.628]  We're good to go.
[00:54:15.292 --> 00:54:20.533]  Jesse Trentadeau, brother of a man who was obviously murdered.
[00:54:22.773 --> 00:54:33.876]  You know, I would have to tell you, Jesse, and I'm going to have to talk to some of the police that investigated all this, and again, they killed cops, they killed a lot of people who were on to what really happened.
[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:43.201]  A lot of people got killed and got threatened who had been in and around McVeigh who could point to the fact that he was a government agent.
[00:54:43.221 --> 00:54:53.323]  Now, I'm not saying your brother was involved in all this, but your brother's coming across the border out of Mexico into San Diego.
[00:54:53.363 --> 00:54:54.183]  He gets picked up.
[00:54:54.223 --> 00:54:55.283]  He gets taken up there.
[00:54:56.144 --> 00:54:57.104]  This happens to him.
[00:54:58.344 --> 00:55:01.405]  I don't think that if they thought he was really involved in the bombing, they would have killed him.
[00:55:01.965 --> 00:55:03.705]  They'd go, oh, look, we got the big prize.
[00:55:04.835 --> 00:55:05.875]  Here's John No.
[00:55:05.895 --> 00:55:05.875]  2.
[00:55:06.335 --> 00:55:08.676]  Instead, they told everybody, shut up, John No.
[00:55:08.696 --> 00:55:09.556]  2 doesn't exist.
[00:55:11.377 --> 00:55:11.997]  Any comments?
[00:55:13.557 --> 00:55:17.118]  All I know is he lived in San Diego, and there was no reason for him to be in Oklahoma.
[00:55:18.919 --> 00:55:22.300]  They transported him, as they said, there, and he's dead two days later.
[00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:25.301]  Now, what happened to the eyewitness?
[00:55:25.921 --> 00:55:27.361]  They found him hanging in his cell.
[00:55:28.862 --> 00:55:32.883]  Now, was that right after the event, or after you'd... What was the time frame?
[00:55:33.588 --> 00:55:37.851]  The time frame was about three or four years later when we finally found him.
[00:55:39.332 --> 00:55:41.054]  The difficulty was finding any witnesses.
[00:55:41.254 --> 00:55:45.337]  Remember, this is a maximum security prison, so you don't even know who was there.
[00:55:47.038 --> 00:55:48.199]  So we find this witness.
[00:55:49.039 --> 00:55:52.321]  We're scheduled to go to trial in Oklahoma against the FBI.
[00:55:53.162 --> 00:55:56.945]  And then a month before the trial was to start, he's suddenly found hanging in his cell.
[00:55:56.965 --> 00:55:58.486]  Well, that's pretty obvious.
[00:56:00.603 --> 00:56:01.664]  Well, he's been threatened, too.
[00:56:01.824 --> 00:56:07.409]  He's been threatened about eight months before, and we tried to get an order from the judge to protect him, but the judge wouldn't give the order.
[00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:21.561]  Well, you know, the government's had problems doing this in mass, because they only have special teams of people that enjoy killing like this, and who can rationalize it, but all the shows like Threat Matrix and 24 and CSI, they all promote torture.
[00:56:21.621 --> 00:56:23.983]  The good guys torture people to death almost every episode.
[00:56:24.424 --> 00:56:25.765]  All the young kids are watching this.
[00:56:25.785 --> 00:56:27.606]  They're about to have a huge army of these people.
[00:56:27.626 --> 00:56:28.367]  We're in deep trouble.
[00:56:30.243 --> 00:56:31.944]  I'm just getting into the mass psychology.
[00:56:31.984 --> 00:56:34.564]  Were you aware they're now legitimizing torturing people to death?
[00:56:35.284 --> 00:56:41.386]  Well, I wasn't, but I can tell you one of the real culprits in this whole mess has been Senator Orrin Hatch.
[00:56:41.946 --> 00:56:42.366]  Oh, really?
[00:56:42.386 --> 00:56:43.887]  The guy that wants Arnold to be president?
[00:56:44.367 --> 00:56:47.348]  Hatch had gone publicly... He's my senator.
[00:56:47.368 --> 00:56:50.849]  Yeah, if there's anything evil, he's a bottomless pit.
[00:56:51.129 --> 00:56:59.311]  He has deliberately kept the Judiciary Committee from inquiring into my brother's murder, the Oklahoma City bombing, anything that relates...
[00:57:00.074 --> 00:57:01.215]  Yeah, I know.
[00:57:01.235 --> 00:57:03.676]  He will not let any hearings take place on him.
[00:57:04.477 --> 00:57:07.598]  I mean, he appears just like everywhere at once.
[00:57:07.819 --> 00:57:10.700]  He's a true entity of evil.
[00:57:12.021 --> 00:57:13.722]  Hatch, yes, very nice person.
[00:57:14.582 --> 00:57:15.863]  So Hatch has been blocking you?
[00:57:16.584 --> 00:57:16.844]  Yes, sir.
[00:57:16.884 --> 00:57:18.725]  He's stopped.
[00:57:18.965 --> 00:57:25.769]  I've had contact with the other members of the Judiciary Committee, and they tell me that he's the roadblock and nothing's going to happen as long as he's there.
[00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:29.211]  Good old Orrin Hatch.
[00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:33.892]  You know, I don't think that guy's really getting re-elected up in Utah.
[00:57:33.912 --> 00:57:35.233]  How does he keep getting re-elected?
[00:57:36.974 --> 00:57:38.175]  He never comes home, I guess.
[00:57:39.335 --> 00:57:43.218]  He just stays away enough that people don't really know what he's like.
[00:57:44.799 --> 00:57:47.821]  I mean, I don't think I've found anything that's horrible that he isn't into.
[00:57:47.921 --> 00:57:51.483]  Open borders, Arnold Schwarzenegger for president, gun grabbing.
[00:57:53.775 --> 00:57:56.717]  And then he claims, I don't know, it's a whole other issue, Orrin Hatch.
[00:57:56.777 --> 00:57:57.978]  It made me think about that guy.
[00:57:58.518 --> 00:58:01.059]  Well, sir, do you think you'll ever get justice?
[00:58:01.079 --> 00:58:02.380]  You're suing the FBI now.
[00:58:03.121 --> 00:58:07.503]  Well, my purpose in suing the FBI now is to get the documents they claim.
[00:58:08.043 --> 00:58:15.508]  One of the things, and I don't know if I said to you, Mr. Jones, that we discovered in this fight is a secret FBI file called the I-Drive.
[00:58:17.213 --> 00:58:24.898]  And I'll send you that information too, but the FBI has a file called the I-Drive where they keep all the evidence and other material they don't want anybody to know about.
[00:58:25.958 --> 00:58:32.603]  So it doesn't go into, if they do an investigation and there's something that's important that hurts their case, it doesn't go into the official file.
[00:58:32.983 --> 00:58:35.724]  It goes into the I-Drive where it remains hidden forever.
[00:58:36.545 --> 00:58:42.809]  And they have thousands of pages in the Oklahoma City I-Drive on me and my brother that no one's ever seen.
[00:58:44.066 --> 00:58:45.189]  Stay there, sir.
[00:58:45.289 --> 00:58:47.917]  I think your case is a key piece of the puzzle.
[00:58:49.021 --> 00:58:49.442]  Stay with us.
[00:58:57.656 --> 00:58:58.296]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.956 --> 00:59:00.017]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.737 --> 00:59:01.858]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.478 --> 00:59:03.338]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.059 --> 00:59:04.959]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.979 --> 00:59:09.281]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.801 --> 00:59:13.943]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.225 --> 00:59:18.185]  All right, folks.
[00:59:18.485 --> 00:59:23.608]  Very serious interview we're doing with attorney Jesse Prentadoob.
[00:59:24.429 --> 00:59:34.292]  His brother was brutally tortured and murdered concerning the Oklahoma City bombing while in FBI custody.
[00:59:34.532 --> 00:59:36.252]  And again, police officers have been killed.
[00:59:36.312 --> 00:59:37.232]  Others have been killed.
[00:59:37.973 --> 00:59:39.013]  Very, very serious.
[00:59:40.053 --> 00:59:41.754]  Headline, Salt Lake City Tribune.
[00:59:42.374 --> 00:59:46.255]  Lawyer, FBI likely knew of Oklahoma bombing plot.
[00:59:46.875 --> 00:59:47.875]  Another headline here.
[00:59:47.935 --> 00:59:50.156]  Lawyer sues FBI over brother's death.
[00:59:51.923 --> 00:59:53.884]  We're going to talk about both of these cases.
[00:59:54.324 --> 01:00:02.086]  For stations that just joined us, though, why don't you recap in a maybe two-minute nutshell what we're talking about here?
[01:00:03.046 --> 01:00:08.348]  Well, my brother Kenneth Michael Trinity was murdered in August of 1995 in Oklahoma City.
[01:00:08.988 --> 01:00:10.969]  He was murdered by the federal government.
[01:00:11.429 --> 01:00:15.030]  He was murdered because they thought he was involved with the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:00:15.970 --> 01:00:21.012]  I have recently come across a couple of secret FBI memoranda
[01:00:21.636 --> 01:00:27.740]  They indicate that they had an informant in with McVeigh and knew in advance that he was going to blow up the Murrow building.
[01:00:29.622 --> 01:00:31.643]  They, of course, denied those documents existed.
[01:00:33.024 --> 01:00:36.967]  Yeah, and they've got the Salt Lake City Tribune here saying local media says they've got copies.
[01:00:36.987 --> 01:00:42.091]  People say it's real, but you want the whole document through a FOIA request, but they're denying that.
[01:00:42.351 --> 01:00:44.692]  But then they say, well, where did you get your document?
[01:00:45.653 --> 01:00:46.554]  I can't disclose that.
[01:00:47.634 --> 01:00:48.695]  Mine is redacted, though.
[01:00:49.035 --> 01:00:51.137]  As you've seen, they've blacked the names out of it.
[01:00:52.887 --> 01:00:57.571]  I want the unredacted one with the names to see who was there and who knew.
[01:00:57.591 --> 01:01:04.656]  Again, for those that just joined us, can you recap how they tortured your brother?
[01:01:05.517 --> 01:01:09.440]  Oh, they... He had stun gun marks all over his body.
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:12.002]  He was beat head to toe, front to back.
[01:01:12.802 --> 01:01:14.583]  His skull was smashed in three places.
[01:01:14.664 --> 01:01:15.464]  His throat was cut.
[01:01:15.704 --> 01:01:17.346]  He was even beaten on the soles of his feet.
[01:01:19.427 --> 01:01:21.609]  Well, yeah, that's got the most nerve endings.
[01:01:22.869 --> 01:01:27.650]  He was systematically tortured for an extended period of time, and then he was strangled with a pair of plastic handcuffs.
[01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:30.931]  And he also has bloody handcuff marks on both his hands.
[01:01:30.951 --> 01:01:31.451]  Yes.
[01:01:32.231 --> 01:01:32.791]  Both his wrists.
[01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:38.933]  Also, you said he had the equivalent of 30 bottles of Coca-Cola, that much caffeine in him.
[01:01:38.953 --> 01:01:41.533]  Again, that's a CIA handbook.
[01:01:41.813 --> 01:01:43.314]  Copper Green and others have that.
[01:01:43.354 --> 01:01:49.635]  You dose somebody up with that, so the neurons are all firing, and it intensifies the pain like putting salt in the wound.
[01:01:50.331 --> 01:01:56.515]  He had consumed that much caffeine within an hour and a half of death in a place where he had no access to caffeine.
[01:01:56.535 --> 01:02:03.399]  He was in the hole, maximum security, locked up 24 hours a day in a remote part of the facility.
[01:02:03.459 --> 01:02:15.107]  Yeah, McDougal said he was going to blow the whistle on Clinton, and it was even in the Fort Worth newspaper that a helicopter landed, FBI guys walked in, spent an hour in the solitary left, and he was found dead the next morning.
[01:02:16.148 --> 01:02:19.689]  Boy, I tell you, I hope I'm never in one of these jail cells and these guys come up on me.
[01:02:20.249 --> 01:02:21.589]  I will never commit suicide.
[01:02:21.609 --> 01:02:22.630]  Let me just say that on record.
[01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:25.070]  Well, they tried to indict me.
[01:02:27.891 --> 01:02:29.191]  Oh, tell me about that.
[01:02:29.571 --> 01:02:38.233]  They had an FBI operative pose as an inmate to say that I had been bribing people to testify against the government.
[01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:43.952]  So they ran before a grand jury on trying to indict me for obstruction of justice.
[01:02:44.152 --> 01:02:45.313]  Where'd they try to indict you?
[01:02:45.573 --> 01:02:46.093]  Oklahoma.
[01:02:46.533 --> 01:02:46.793]  Yeah.
[01:02:47.213 --> 01:02:49.134]  And then the grand jury didn't buy it?
[01:02:49.734 --> 01:02:50.415]  Apparently not.
[01:02:54.756 --> 01:03:02.099]  Man, they'll have some informant with a rap sheet ten feet tall, and then they'll try to just have them point the finger at you for anything, won't they?
[01:03:02.119 --> 01:03:05.941]  That's a person I'd never known, never spoke to, never written, never communicated with in any way.
[01:03:06.775 --> 01:03:11.999]  Well, there's a special area of hell reserved for those that bear false witness.
[01:03:15.241 --> 01:03:15.882]  Did you know that?
[01:03:16.282 --> 01:03:19.064]  Well, I'm sure it's full of FBI agents.
[01:03:21.246 --> 01:03:26.009]  It would be harder to find a more worthless, low-life bunch than those folks.
[01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:28.010]  What do you mean?
[01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:34.155]  It came out in Boston that they actually ran the mafia, ran the murder for hire, and then would kill innocent people that stood up against them.
[01:03:35.402 --> 01:03:37.203]  What's wrong with being the mafia?
[01:03:37.823 --> 01:03:40.204]  With a badge and a fancy black suit?
[01:03:41.025 --> 01:03:48.248]  Well, I tell you, Mr. Jones, my view of the FBI is they're worse than the old Soviet KGB, and I tell you why.
[01:03:48.408 --> 01:03:49.609]  Well, tell me when we get back.
[01:03:49.969 --> 01:03:50.229]  Okay.
[01:03:50.369 --> 01:03:51.890]  They all live in big houses around here.
[01:03:55.658 --> 01:04:01.142]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:04:01.563 --> 01:04:05.806]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:04:06.026 --> 01:04:13.072]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:04:13.452 --> 01:04:19.557]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:04:19.697 --> 01:04:20.918]  There are no side effects.
[01:04:21.098 --> 01:04:21.579]  We're good to go.
[01:04:21.619 --> 01:04:22.100]  We're good to go.
[01:04:38.021 --> 01:04:41.166]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[01:04:41.186 --> 01:04:41.226]  866-885-6625.
[01:04:41.246 --> 01:04:41.286]  866-885-6625.
[01:04:41.527 --> 01:04:42.468]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:04:42.488 --> 01:04:42.688]  Call today.
[01:04:53.178 --> 01:04:56.459]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:04:56.519 --> 01:05:00.700]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:05:00.941 --> 01:05:03.741]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:05:03.922 --> 01:05:06.322]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:05:06.522 --> 01:05:15.145]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:05:15.345 --> 01:05:16.706]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:05:16.886 --> 01:05:21.067]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:05:21.387 --> 01:05:22.168]  We're good to go.
[01:05:52.730 --> 01:05:59.554]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny on DVD.
[01:05:59.874 --> 01:06:01.255]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:06:01.455 --> 01:06:03.656]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:06:03.796 --> 01:06:05.897]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:06:06.178 --> 01:06:11.100]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:06:11.441 --> 01:06:15.483]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:06:15.723 --> 01:06:16.164]  We're good to go.
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:31.120]  Big Brother.
[01:06:58.909 --> 01:06:59.970]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:01.770]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.431 --> 01:07:03.291]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.011 --> 01:07:04.892]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:04.912 --> 01:07:09.214]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.754 --> 01:07:13.896]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.316 --> 01:07:16.857]  Now, I want to be clear about this.
[01:07:18.538 --> 01:07:26.421]  I think that most of the FBI are compartmentalized, investigating bank robberies, white-collar crime.
[01:07:30.669 --> 01:07:40.031]  But when you get into the intelligence arms of it, the anti-terrorism arms of it, and then you get into certain cities and the organized crime investigation arms, they just become the organized crime.
[01:07:40.991 --> 01:07:41.971]  And this has been going on.
[01:07:41.991 --> 01:07:43.572]  This happens in almost every other country.
[01:07:44.072 --> 01:07:46.652]  Bad people get into positions and they put bad people under them.
[01:07:47.253 --> 01:07:51.594]  And in just a few years, a few decades, you get a thoroughly rotten organization.
[01:07:52.414 --> 01:07:56.795]  And clearly, folks, the FBI ran the bombing of the World Trade Center in 93.
[01:07:57.055 --> 01:07:57.655]  That's admitted.
[01:07:57.935 --> 01:07:58.495]  That's public.
[01:08:00.012 --> 01:08:02.754]  They cooked a bomb, trained the driver, the informant said, let's bust him.
[01:08:02.774 --> 01:08:03.914]  They said, no, it goes forward.
[01:08:04.694 --> 01:08:06.435]  Clearly they were involved in Oklahoma City.
[01:08:07.356 --> 01:08:09.577]  Clearly they were involved in the murder of a police officer.
[01:08:11.297 --> 01:08:19.601]  And clearly this man's brother, this prominent lawyer's brother, was in their custody and was tortured to death.
[01:08:20.633 --> 01:08:24.156]  You were going to finish up your point of why you're saying they're worse than the KGB.
[01:08:24.656 --> 01:08:25.737]  They are, in my opinion.
[01:08:26.097 --> 01:08:26.678]  Tell us why.
[01:08:27.218 --> 01:08:32.802]  They do the same thing as the KGB, but the KGB never pretended to be a legitimate law enforcement agency.
[01:08:35.624 --> 01:08:40.168]  Well, in Russia they did, and overseas I guess they did kind of.
[01:08:40.208 --> 01:08:41.669]  Well, in my view of them they didn't.
[01:08:41.729 --> 01:08:43.310]  I mean, they were there to protect the state.
[01:08:44.752 --> 01:08:48.975]  Not there to serve the interest of justice, and they made no pretense about that.
[01:08:48.995 --> 01:08:50.937]  Let me stop you, sir.
[01:08:50.957 --> 01:08:52.658]  We've had him on for 35 minutes.
[01:08:52.678 --> 01:08:53.619]  I'm honored to have him.
[01:08:53.639 --> 01:08:55.140]  We'll keep him on as long as we can.
[01:08:56.441 --> 01:08:58.483]  We're joined by Colonel Craig Roberts.
[01:08:59.404 --> 01:09:10.013]  Craig's obviously a best-selling author, Marine Corps sniper, police officer, helicopter pilot, SWAT team commander, whole nine yards, good friend of mine.
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:11.501]  I'll be happy to.
[01:09:11.521 --> 01:09:12.301]  Did you say Marine Corps?
[01:09:12.321 --> 01:09:12.381]  Yes.
[01:09:26.113 --> 01:09:26.714]  I was a Marine.
[01:09:27.054 --> 01:09:27.454]  All right.
[01:09:27.534 --> 01:09:31.798]  Well, Colonel Roberts was a Marine and then also a Colonel in the Army in Intelligence.
[01:09:32.218 --> 01:09:37.663]  Colonel Roberts, good to have you on with us, sir, on such short notice.
[01:09:37.683 --> 01:09:41.626]  I hope I didn't catch you in the middle of something.
[01:09:41.906 --> 01:09:44.508]  Well, we were launching a space capsule, but it's no big deal, Alex.
[01:09:44.528 --> 01:09:45.509]  I always make room for you.
[01:09:45.569 --> 01:09:46.670]  You've got the open door here.
[01:09:48.291 --> 01:09:54.957]  I know who Mr. Trinidou is because the Trinidou case surfaced during the Oklahoma City bombing investigation.
[01:09:55.976 --> 01:10:00.379]  Okay, now, before we go any further, first let's talk about the police officer's murder you investigated.
[01:10:00.399 --> 01:10:01.880]  In a nutshell, give that to us.
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:08.784]  Well, you know, there's been so many deaths around the Oklahoma City bombing since then, but you're talking about Terrence Yakey.
[01:10:08.824 --> 01:10:10.925]  Terry Yakey was the... Top of the year.
[01:10:11.265 --> 01:10:17.309]  Sergeant who was police officer of the year in Oklahoma City, who was one of the first two guys in the building.
[01:10:17.689 --> 01:10:23.933]  He was just a couple of blocks away when the bomb went off, or bombs went off, and...
[01:10:25.775 --> 01:10:31.337]  The things that he saw inside the building disturbed him so much that he kept trying to report to the department, to the FBI, and so on.
[01:10:31.717 --> 01:10:32.957]  He was pretty much warned away.
[01:10:32.977 --> 01:10:37.058]  He said, leave it alone, go with the official version, keep your mouth shut, mind your own business.
[01:10:37.519 --> 01:10:39.279]  He wouldn't do that.
[01:10:39.299 --> 01:10:51.762]  A few months later, they found him dead out in the field, declared it a suicide, no matter about all of the damage that was done to the body, all the cuts on the wrist and the inside of the elbows, the two slash marks on the jugular veins on the throat.
[01:10:51.782 --> 01:10:52.503]  He'd been beaten up.
[01:10:52.523 --> 01:10:53.583]  He'd been wearing handcuffs.
[01:10:54.478 --> 01:11:02.120]  And he was shot from the top right of his skull down through his left cheek with a small caliber weapon that left very little powder residue, which means there was a silencer involved.
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:06.780]  And then right before, the last time he talked to anybody, he had gone to a storage shed.
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:07.581]  He had material.
[01:11:07.861 --> 01:11:10.121]  He called and said, I've got them now.
[01:11:10.201 --> 01:11:11.361]  Can you go over that for us?
[01:11:11.381 --> 01:11:20.463]  Well, he said that they had broken into his apartment, they'd broken into his car, but he still had everything, all of his notes and everything, and other material, whatever that was, in a briefcase.
[01:11:21.001 --> 01:11:23.682]  That he was taken out to a storage, a mini-storage he had.
[01:11:24.062 --> 01:11:25.402]  It was either UConn or El Reno.
[01:11:25.422 --> 01:11:26.582]  I can't remember which it was right now.
[01:11:27.303 --> 01:11:29.323]  And he was talking to a friend on the phone.
[01:11:29.343 --> 01:11:30.743]  He said, when I get back, we'll have dinner.
[01:11:30.823 --> 01:11:32.944]  As soon as I can shake these feds that are following me.
[01:11:32.964 --> 01:11:35.945]  And he told him that there was two guys in a white sedan that had been following him.
[01:11:36.085 --> 01:11:40.766]  Now, again, a highly decorated officer, tough guy, well-known, well-loved on the force.
[01:11:42.106 --> 01:11:43.927]  Obviously, these were just common street thugs.
[01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:45.047]  He had pulled his gun on them.
[01:11:45.307 --> 01:11:47.627]  They obviously had flashed their badges to get him in the vehicle.
[01:11:49.668 --> 01:11:49.808]  Well...
[01:11:50.683 --> 01:12:01.950]  They somehow got him pulled over and got the car off onto a side road off of I-40 near the El Reno Reformatory, about a mile from the El Reno Reformatory where McVeigh was being held at the time.
[01:12:02.546 --> 01:12:08.528]  And his body was found the next morning out in the middle of a field, a half a mile from the car, across the creek and through a barbed wire fence.
[01:12:08.588 --> 01:12:10.189]  And he'd obviously run from them, yeah.
[01:12:10.249 --> 01:12:17.952]  Yeah, and they caught up with him and they beat him up and, you know, they evidently had handcuffs on him as well because the, not the people who did the autopsy.
[01:12:17.972 --> 01:12:21.994]  Don, how do they get these guys, I mean, these feds to kill cops?
[01:12:22.034 --> 01:12:23.714]  I mean, how do they rationalize that?
[01:12:23.894 --> 01:12:26.576]  Well, I don't know that these guys would be like FBI feds.
[01:12:26.636 --> 01:12:27.256]  I think the government...
[01:12:28.697 --> 01:12:35.004]  I think the government has their own people to take care of, you know, exterminate with extreme prejudice-type missions.
[01:12:35.244 --> 01:12:36.385]  Above Delta, guys.
[01:12:36.746 --> 01:12:44.554]  Well, you know, we ran across, during the Waco deal, a Delta Force G squadron.
[01:12:44.614 --> 01:12:47.437]  Well, there is no Delta Force G squadron on paper.
[01:12:47.637 --> 01:12:49.900]  I mean, in reality, who knows?
[01:12:51.006 --> 01:12:56.750]  You know, could this be some kind of a hit team that government, or some people inside government, used to do assassinations?
[01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:59.832]  You know, we made assassinations illegal, so now it would all have to be black ops.
[01:13:00.292 --> 01:13:02.594]  You know, all of that stuff's kind of up for speculation.
[01:13:02.654 --> 01:13:05.916]  But how do they get these guys to kill, I mean, kill a good cop?
[01:13:05.976 --> 01:13:09.258]  I mean, if I could see them rationalizing and, you know, playing mind games.
[01:13:09.578 --> 01:13:10.999]  These are purely evil people.
[01:13:11.179 --> 01:13:15.642]  Well, the guy you'd really enjoy talking to would be Colonel Daniel Marvin.
[01:13:16.474 --> 01:13:27.157]  They approached him back in the 60s to kill a Navy Lieutenant Commander at Bethesda Naval Hospital, the guy who had looked at Kennedy's autopsy x-rays and said that, you know, we've got problems here.
[01:13:28.037 --> 01:13:32.638]  And they had tried to recruit him to do that inside the United States.
[01:13:32.738 --> 01:13:34.779]  Now, he was Special Forces at Fort Bragg at the time.
[01:13:34.819 --> 01:13:35.579]  He was a captain then.
[01:13:36.159 --> 01:13:38.660]  And he said, I'm not going to do any operations inside the United States.
[01:13:39.218 --> 01:13:41.119]  So, you know, this has been going on for a long time.
[01:13:41.379 --> 01:13:42.540]  Colonel Roberts, may I ask a question?
[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:42.920]  Sure.
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:50.244]  You mentioned that Officer Yakey, his family contacted me here about a month ago, and they told me exactly what you told the audience.
[01:13:50.905 --> 01:13:55.247]  The one thing they didn't tell me that you mentioned that's intriguing to me, you said his throat had been slashed.
[01:13:55.567 --> 01:13:55.768]  Yes.
[01:13:56.148 --> 01:13:57.208]  My brother's throat was cut, too.
[01:13:57.228 --> 01:13:58.229]  Did you find out why?
[01:13:58.249 --> 01:13:59.089]  Did you ever determine why?
[01:13:59.490 --> 01:14:02.671]  Well, you know, the rumor is that a...
[01:14:04.403 --> 01:14:09.086]  A prison reaction team, or SWAT team, went in there, beat him up, killed him, and then framed him to look like a suicide.
[01:14:09.106 --> 01:14:12.528]  There was blood all over the walls, according to the Oklahoma City Medical Examiner.
[01:14:13.769 --> 01:14:16.911]  You know, if you're going to commit suicide, you don't get your blood all over the walls.
[01:14:18.612 --> 01:14:20.734]  And there really wasn't any place to hang himself in there.
[01:14:21.254 --> 01:14:24.216]  I mean, that bed sheet thing, that was so fabricated, it was ridiculous.
[01:14:24.396 --> 01:14:27.298]  Well, I mean, Officer Yankee, did you ever determine why they cut his throat?
[01:14:27.858 --> 01:14:31.020]  Well, there was a slash mark on each side of his neck.
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:32.481]  I've got the file on it.
[01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:33.302]  I'd be glad to send you.
[01:14:34.385 --> 01:14:39.848]  There was a slash mark on each jugular vein, probably two to three inches long, according to the autopsy diagrams.
[01:14:41.909 --> 01:14:51.694]  And he had, like, three cuts on one wrist, four on the other, four inside one elbow, three inside the other elbow, and then one on each side of his neck.
[01:14:52.034 --> 01:14:53.055]  Now, those were just the cuts.
[01:14:54.616 --> 01:14:55.556]  Why they did that, I don't know.
[01:14:55.576 --> 01:14:56.657]  Were they torturing him?
[01:14:57.377 --> 01:15:01.139]  Were they trying to make it look like he was doing hesitation marks, trying to commit suicide?
[01:15:01.159 --> 01:15:02.940]  If he was cutting himself with a knife, why did he shoot himself?
[01:15:04.179 --> 01:15:05.200]  None of it makes any sense.
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:08.641]  When I wrote, the chief of police in Oklahoma City, who was M.T.
[01:15:08.701 --> 01:15:12.783]  Berry at the time, I sent him a complete report.
[01:15:12.823 --> 01:15:13.703]  I sent him all the pictures.
[01:15:13.743 --> 01:15:15.043]  I said, you need to reopen this case.
[01:15:15.143 --> 01:15:16.544]  This is an obvious homicide.
[01:15:16.564 --> 01:15:17.945]  I've already talked to some medical examiners.
[01:15:18.265 --> 01:15:21.806]  This is an obvious homicide made to look like a suicide.
[01:15:21.866 --> 01:15:23.367]  You guys need to go back and look at this.
[01:15:23.467 --> 01:15:26.268]  I got back a one-page, very nasty letter to mind my own business.
[01:15:29.298 --> 01:15:35.120]  So, cops don't get too mad about cop killing if the establishment's doing it.
[01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:38.781]  Actually, I went down to Oklahoma City and I met with about eight police officers.
[01:15:38.861 --> 01:15:40.521]  I know the ground level ones are angry.
[01:15:41.101 --> 01:15:48.663]  They're mad, but their deal is, hey, I've got to feed my family and the brass are running the show, and if I get involved in this, the same thing's going to happen to me.
[01:15:48.683 --> 01:15:50.804]  But you know that attitude is what gives us slavery.
[01:15:51.624 --> 01:15:54.245]  I mean, if we all started standing up, there's nothing they could do.
[01:15:55.541 --> 01:15:56.562]  Oh, yeah, of course.
[01:15:56.622 --> 01:15:59.525]  But, you know, it's back to the same old thing we've talked about a hundred times.
[01:15:59.565 --> 01:16:01.366]  How do you get the ostriches to pull their head out of the sand?
[01:16:01.586 --> 01:16:03.828]  Colonel Roberts, I'm trying to understand this now.
[01:16:06.471 --> 01:16:08.232]  You're familiar with the Trenton Duke case.
[01:16:08.633 --> 01:16:09.653]  He's down in Mexico.
[01:16:09.714 --> 01:16:11.215]  He comes up into San Diego.
[01:16:11.515 --> 01:16:12.116]  They grab him.
[01:16:12.136 --> 01:16:13.437]  They take him to Oklahoma.
[01:16:13.897 --> 01:16:16.620]  From what you know about the case, you guys are here together right now.
[01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:18.822]  Why do you think they killed his brother?
[01:16:19.602 --> 01:16:20.943]  Well, that's a...
[01:16:22.327 --> 01:16:24.348]  All I know is on that end of it.
[01:16:24.968 --> 01:16:28.891]  I know that he was murdered and they wrote it up as a suicide and they won't do anything about it.
[01:16:29.431 --> 01:16:31.532]  The Federal Transfer Center had just opened up.
[01:16:31.612 --> 01:16:32.913]  It hadn't been opened up very long.
[01:16:33.833 --> 01:16:35.814]  Probably less than 12 or 24 months.
[01:16:37.195 --> 01:16:37.935]  And that's all it was.
[01:16:37.955 --> 01:16:38.576]  It wasn't a prison.
[01:16:38.616 --> 01:16:41.597]  It was a transfer center where they hold you temporarily to move you on to someplace else.
[01:16:42.358 --> 01:16:46.740]  What really is hard to understand is how a place like that
[01:16:47.182 --> 01:16:52.666]  Would have individuals in there that could go in and do this because they were hiring for this place.
[01:16:52.726 --> 01:16:57.149]  I mean, most of the people that worked there were fairly new employees and you weren't going to talk these guys down in there to do that.
[01:16:57.229 --> 01:17:02.952]  You had to have somebody coming from outside to do this.
[01:17:03.072 --> 01:17:13.840]  The rumor, you know, and there's nothing to verify it, and I like to work with fact, but supposedly he had overheard something that had to do with the Oklahoma City bombing and wanted to talk to somebody about it.
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:15.821]  Now what that is, I don't know.
[01:17:17.207 --> 01:17:18.128]  We never will know now.
[01:17:18.628 --> 01:17:20.029]  And if that's even true, I don't know.
[01:17:20.609 --> 01:17:22.971]  But that's where his name popped up in the Oklahoma City case.
[01:17:23.011 --> 01:17:34.717]  Now, one of our team members was David Hoffman, who wrote the book Oklahoma City Bombing and the Politics of Terror, which Buck Revell sued and had the publisher destroy all the copies that hadn't already been sold.
[01:17:34.777 --> 01:17:35.898]  So there are very few out there.
[01:17:36.508 --> 01:17:39.609]  But he, I think in that book, he even talked about the Trinidou case.
[01:17:39.689 --> 01:17:53.492]  Because he was talking about all the different people who had died... Well, also, then the guy that they finally found four years later who'd gotten in contact with Trinidou's brother, who we've got on with us right now, then he kills himself a month before it goes to trial.
[01:17:54.292 --> 01:17:55.372]  Craig, were you aware of that?
[01:17:55.573 --> 01:17:56.493]  No, that's news to me.
[01:17:56.913 --> 01:17:59.133]  You want to tell him about that, Mr. Trinidou?
[01:17:59.413 --> 01:18:01.494]  Yes, we had an inmate who was a witness.
[01:18:03.854 --> 01:18:05.815]  We discovered, and just shortly before trial...
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:09.541]  They found him hanging in his cell just like my brother.
[01:18:09.561 --> 01:18:12.143]  Incredible.
[01:18:13.143 --> 01:18:14.043]  It's unbelievable.
[01:18:14.083 --> 01:18:15.144]  It just goes on and on.
[01:18:16.905 --> 01:18:19.306]  Colonel Robertson, you go to Infowars.com.
[01:18:19.326 --> 01:18:22.547]  We've got the photos posted of the torture.
[01:18:22.567 --> 01:18:23.768]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[01:18:24.468 --> 01:18:28.950]  What are some other websites we could visit to look at information about this, Mr. Trinidad?
[01:18:30.091 --> 01:18:32.252]  I think you just type in the name and it will show up.
[01:18:33.567 --> 01:18:34.027]  Yeah.
[01:18:34.067 --> 01:18:36.289]  Alex, give Mr. Trenton to do my home phone.
[01:18:36.309 --> 01:18:36.829]  Well, I'll do that.
[01:18:36.869 --> 01:18:37.590]  Stay there, Colonel.
[01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:39.131]  Do one more second with us, okay?
[01:18:39.151 --> 01:18:40.352]  All right.
[01:18:40.652 --> 01:18:42.513]  And we'll give him your home phone number.
[01:18:42.974 --> 01:18:45.115]  And then I guess when he gets off air, he can call you.
[01:18:45.135 --> 01:18:48.318]  It's a bottomless pit of evil.
[01:18:48.338 --> 01:18:50.019]  We'll be right back.

[01:19:49.403 --> 01:19:52.584]  The choice is yours.
[01:19:53.945 --> 01:19:56.947]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:19:56.967 --> 01:20:06.151]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:20:06.451 --> 01:20:11.114]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:20:11.594 --> 01:20:18.316]  The Berkey Light is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.

[01:20:52.916 --> 01:20:59.141]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:20:59.581 --> 01:21:07.367]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:21:07.708 --> 01:21:15.554]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:21:15.874 --> 01:21:20.638]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:21:20.958 --> 01:21:25.662]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:21:26.183 --> 01:21:30.026]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:21:30.526 --> 01:21:31.547]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:31.627 --> 01:21:35.710]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:21:36.131 --> 01:21:40.514]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:21:41.035 --> 01:21:43.557]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:21:44.017 --> 01:21:46.578]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:47.918 --> 01:21:49.218]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:49.438 --> 01:21:57.480]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glass, who is a pharmacist from Marks Plaza Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[01:21:57.620 --> 01:21:58.000]  Hi, Alan.
[01:21:58.020 --> 01:21:58.840]  Welcome to the program.
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:21:59.580]  Thank you, Marvin.
[01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:03.121]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[01:22:03.301 --> 01:22:03.841]  Is that true?
[01:22:04.061 --> 01:22:05.161]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[01:22:05.181 --> 01:22:08.062]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[01:22:08.102 --> 01:22:08.362]  prices.
[01:22:08.562 --> 01:22:10.644]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[01:22:10.684 --> 01:22:11.424]  They're very common.
[01:22:11.524 --> 01:22:14.687]  Those common drugs you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[01:22:14.727 --> 01:22:15.007]  price.
[01:22:15.267 --> 01:22:16.428]  Now what about Tamoxifen?
[01:22:16.468 --> 01:22:18.870]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:22.873]  Tamoxifen, you can see a 75% savings against the regular U.S.
[01:22:22.913 --> 01:22:23.173]  price.
[01:22:23.553 --> 01:22:25.935]  Now are these brand name products made by the same company?
[01:22:26.235 --> 01:22:28.216]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[01:22:28.256 --> 01:22:30.278]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.
[01:22:30.538 --> 01:22:35.459]  So to save money on prescription drugs in Canada, call the toll-free number for your information package.
[01:22:35.719 --> 01:22:37.660]  To find out more, call toll-free 1-800-840-0686.
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:38.100]  That's 1-800-840-0686.
[01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:39.380]  Or go on the web at www.canshipdrugs.com.
[01:23:02.689 --> 01:23:10.516]  I've been talking to Colonel Roberts, Fred Roberts, during the break, and obviously there's some things he can't talk about on air, but off air, he'll be able to tell Mr. Trenado about it.
[01:23:11.557 --> 01:23:13.319]  But clearly, it's what I surmise.
[01:23:13.479 --> 01:23:15.160]  It's not just that he looked like John Doe No.
[01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:15.501]  2, folks.
[01:23:15.881 --> 01:23:19.464]  Again, getting brought in, because he looks a little bit like John Doe No. 2.
[01:23:20.919 --> 01:23:24.840]  And then he's in custody at that holding center and hears some things.
[01:23:25.621 --> 01:23:31.502]  I figured it was something like that because why would they torture him to death, find out who else he talked to, and then kill him?
[01:23:32.863 --> 01:23:38.705]  But going back now, and go ahead and close your microphone down for me there, guys.
[01:23:38.725 --> 01:23:39.265]  Thank you.
[01:23:40.656 --> 01:23:43.318]  Going back now to Jesse Trinidou and Colonel Roberts.
[01:23:44.338 --> 01:23:46.920]  Jesse, what would you like to see come out of this?
[01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:49.322]  I mean, you're suing the government to get documents.
[01:23:49.382 --> 01:23:50.823]  You've already got a lot of the documents.
[01:23:52.144 --> 01:23:53.565]  You are suing them.
[01:23:53.885 --> 01:23:54.746]  Here's the headline.
[01:23:54.806 --> 01:23:56.948]  Lawyer sues FBI over brother's death.
[01:23:57.708 --> 01:23:58.949]  Is that an accurate headline?
[01:23:59.329 --> 01:24:00.971]  It is.
[01:24:01.671 --> 01:24:03.192]  Any other key points you'd like to make?
[01:24:03.613 --> 01:24:05.234]  Any questions you've got for Colonel Roberts?
[01:24:05.274 --> 01:24:06.455]  Any questions he has for you?
[01:24:06.975 --> 01:24:07.916]  Well, I would...
[01:24:09.801 --> 01:24:12.763]  I just like justice for my brother's death.
[01:24:14.304 --> 01:24:23.109]  And I think the only way I'll get it is to help from folks like you, sir, to get this story out there to your audience and have them stand up.
[01:24:23.309 --> 01:24:26.751]  As you said, if everyone stood up to the government, we wouldn't have a problem.
[01:24:27.651 --> 01:24:31.353]  It's letting things like this go on and not speaking out.
[01:24:31.494 --> 01:24:39.198]  You know, contacting Hatch and screaming, contacting your senators, just forcing enough embarrassment on these people until they finally have to do something.
[01:24:40.239 --> 01:24:43.680]  I mean, they just sweep these things under the rug all the time.
[01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:54.443]  Hey, look, I got BBC and AP where they literally dump, they grab people's children, CPS does, and then they test pesticides on them until they die.
[01:24:54.883 --> 01:24:56.023]  Then they're killing children.
[01:24:56.363 --> 01:25:01.284]  Colonel Roberts, people, I don't think, realize how much evil is actively going on, do they?
[01:25:01.824 --> 01:25:06.406]  Well, you know, if you get my book, The Medusa File, it's case after case after case after case of this stuff.
[01:25:07.146 --> 01:25:07.626]  And, you know...
[01:25:08.539 --> 01:25:12.540]  Satan's out there, and he's working through these people, and they have no qualms about doing these things.
[01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:19.722]  Just the section alone on government guinea pigs from before World War II all the way up to present with the MKUltra stuff.
[01:25:20.182 --> 01:25:28.704]  Look at the Finders case where they were using children to do pornography so that they could blackmail politicians in Washington, D.C.
[01:25:29.324 --> 01:25:30.104]  The Franklin case.
[01:25:30.124 --> 01:25:31.445]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[01:25:31.685 --> 01:25:32.565]  Bohemian Grove.
[01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:36.213]  Martin Preschool, which was an actual true case.
[01:25:36.654 --> 01:25:39.878]  It wasn't bogus stuff like the media trying to cover it up.
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:42.242]  We see this stuff going on and on all the time.
[01:25:43.143 --> 01:25:44.345]  And yet the media said...
[01:25:45.090 --> 01:25:50.151]  And they won't investigate it, or if they do, they cover it up and say it's not really true, it's a myth.
[01:25:50.651 --> 01:25:53.652]  And you worked the case for years there in Oklahoma, Colonel Roberts.
[01:25:55.152 --> 01:25:57.433]  How many people have they killed?
[01:25:57.733 --> 01:26:04.915]  I mean, after the 168 they murdered, I mean, how many people have they murdered where it's clear murder to cover up what really happened?
[01:26:05.015 --> 01:26:08.736]  Well, I'll put it under either murder or suspicious circumstances, at least a dozen.
[01:26:09.596 --> 01:26:13.417]  And there may be more than that by now, because I haven't followed up on it recently.
[01:26:13.477 --> 01:26:14.337]  I've kind of passed the
[01:26:14.747 --> 01:26:20.544]  It has the torch on to people who live closer to the scene now to keep an eye on this, and I've turned over a lot of my records and stuff to them.
[01:26:21.258 --> 01:26:26.681]  And I can put Mr. Trenadue in touch with a couple of people who probably would be glad to work with him on this, too.
[01:26:26.861 --> 01:26:28.983]  By the way, Mr. Trenadue got harassed.
[01:26:29.003 --> 01:26:36.067]  They tried to have some informant claim he was trying to bribe people for testimony, and the grand jury shot that down.
[01:26:36.427 --> 01:26:39.709]  You've had your own harassment, Colonel Roberts, over investigating this.
[01:26:40.209 --> 01:26:41.310]  Oh, I've been threatened.
[01:26:41.370 --> 01:26:44.892]  I've had dead animals put on my front porch and in my mailbox.
[01:26:45.452 --> 01:26:46.353]  My mail's been opened.
[01:26:46.413 --> 01:26:47.593]  My email's been intercepted.
[01:26:47.633 --> 01:26:48.854]  My fax machine was tapped.
[01:26:49.274 --> 01:26:50.435]  Both my phones were tapped.
[01:26:51.292 --> 01:26:52.753]  I was followed on several occasions.
[01:26:52.813 --> 01:26:53.934]  I had my house staked out.
[01:26:54.455 --> 01:26:54.975]  But you know what?
[01:26:54.995 --> 01:27:00.119]  I was in the Marine Corps, and I was in Vietnam, and they did everything they could to kill me over there and didn't succeed.
[01:27:00.959 --> 01:27:01.860]  I'm not afraid of anything.
[01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:08.705]  You've just got to go out there and stand up for what God tells you to do and not worry about this stuff and do the best you can.
[01:27:09.126 --> 01:27:11.347]  Yeah, we've got to be men again.
[01:27:11.628 --> 01:27:12.608]  Well, I've got to tell people this.
[01:27:12.628 --> 01:27:16.171]  When I was getting ready to go to Vietnam, my grandfather, who was a Primitive Baptist preacher, said,
[01:27:16.846 --> 01:27:19.268]  Going to Vietnam and them Vietnam boys are going to be trying to kill you.
[01:27:19.288 --> 01:27:19.868]  And I said, yes, sir.
[01:27:19.888 --> 01:27:21.189]  He said, well, you don't have to worry about a thing.
[01:27:21.209 --> 01:27:21.870]  And I said, I don't?
[01:27:21.890 --> 01:27:22.490]  And he said, no.
[01:27:22.530 --> 01:27:24.692]  He says, good Lord calls you home and you can't stop it.
[01:27:24.732 --> 01:27:26.273]  And if he ain't ready, no one can rush it.
[01:27:26.673 --> 01:27:27.894]  And I've just lived my life that way.
[01:27:29.235 --> 01:27:29.636]  All right.
[01:27:29.716 --> 01:27:31.157]  Anything we can do for you, Jesse?
[01:27:31.177 --> 01:27:32.918]  I mean, you've got Colonel Roberts' phone number.
[01:27:33.178 --> 01:27:33.498]  I do.
[01:27:33.578 --> 01:27:38.142]  I appreciate the opportunity, I said, sir, to tell your audience about this and have them look at those photographs.
[01:27:39.243 --> 01:27:41.044]  I don't know if you'll post those memos or not.
[01:27:41.304 --> 01:27:43.566]  Or if Colonel Roberts has seen them, I'll certainly share them with him.
[01:27:45.017 --> 01:27:46.158]  We're posting them right now.
[01:27:46.218 --> 01:27:50.080]  I just talked to my webmaster during the last break, in between talking to both you guys.
[01:27:51.101 --> 01:27:55.963]  So we're going to get that done up on Infowars.com and all the different news stories together.
[01:27:56.624 --> 01:28:03.547]  And I hope to have maybe both of you back up in the near future together to flesh out Oklahoma City a little bit more as well.
[01:28:03.988 --> 01:28:04.708]  I'd be happy to.
[01:28:06.689 --> 01:28:09.991]  Sir, if I get those memos unredacted, you've got the copies as soon as I get them.
[01:28:11.266 --> 01:28:13.888]  Well, I think you can sue them until the cows come home.
[01:28:13.908 --> 01:28:17.892]  You know, they sued them over trying to get the surveillance camera tapes, and they won't release those, will they, Colonel?
[01:28:18.132 --> 01:28:19.233]  No, we've worked on that.
[01:28:19.613 --> 01:28:22.776]  And when I travel and do lectures, I challenge them.
[01:28:22.816 --> 01:28:26.639]  I say, you guys want to prove that there's only two people involved in this or one person involved?
[01:28:26.679 --> 01:28:27.339]  Show us the tape.
[01:28:27.419 --> 01:28:28.440]  Show us the Zapruder film.
[01:28:29.081 --> 01:28:29.521]  They won't do it.
[01:28:31.303 --> 01:28:31.763]  All right.
[01:28:31.843 --> 01:28:36.567]  Well, I want to thank both of you for coming on, and I'm sorry for what happened to your brother, Mr. Trinidou.
[01:28:36.587 --> 01:28:38.208]  I appreciate that, sir.
[01:28:38.548 --> 01:28:39.009]  Take care.
[01:28:40.259 --> 01:28:43.281]  But the people that did it are going to hell, so that's some constant.
[01:28:43.661 --> 01:28:44.582]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.042 --> 01:28:46.663]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.564 --> 01:28:50.266]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.385 --> 01:28:56.767]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:28:57.027 --> 01:28:57.347]  Why?
[01:28:57.687 --> 01:29:00.309]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[01:29:00.389 --> 01:29:05.332]  Cardivite drops in capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[01:29:05.452 --> 01:29:15.177]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle tissue, mitigating heart rhythm abnormalities, and improving oxygen and blood flow in the heart.

[01:30:01.660 --> 01:30:06.023]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.

[01:30:53.919 --> 01:30:56.800]  SuperSilver's combination of supercharged silver and oxygen
[01:31:13.986 --> 01:31:29.599]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:36.245]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.
[01:31:36.625 --> 01:31:37.045]  We're good to go.
[01:31:37.065 --> 01:31:37.285]  I think?
[01:32:02.828 --> 01:32:15.896]  Just a very painful interview in the last hour to listen to how they tortured his brother to death in a seat of photos, and to know that they go grab cops, you know, cop of the year, and torture him to death and kill him.
[01:32:17.858 --> 01:32:20.479]  And it's just anything for power and control, and they get off on it.
[01:32:20.519 --> 01:32:26.103]  Coming up here in a few minutes, we're going to have John Moore, another great patriot on the show, to give us his view on the New World Order.
[01:32:26.123 --> 01:32:30.606]  His website's thelimbertyman.com, colonelrobertsriflewarrior.com,
[01:32:32.385 --> 01:32:42.733]  The other great American, we were just talking during the break, and we have better radio during the breaks than we do on air, and I was about to let you go, but in a nutshell, I was asking you, man, how are these people so evil?
[01:32:42.753 --> 01:32:57.984]  Because, you know, most people that are corrupt just rationalize what they're doing, but these psychopaths that can do this to children and people chained down into cops and they're in positions of power, I mean, and then you really boiled it down nicely, Colonel.
[01:32:58.304 --> 01:32:59.165]  Boil that down for us.
[01:32:59.605 --> 01:33:05.350]  Well, you know, I've run into my law enforcement career people who were just absolutely bad.
[01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:06.991]  There was just nothing that was going to change it.
[01:33:07.171 --> 01:33:08.152]  I don't care what you did.
[01:33:09.433 --> 01:33:18.881]  It was always a mystery to me how anybody could be that way and just have no qualms about doing bad things or shooting somebody or killing them or torturing them or whatever.
[01:33:19.121 --> 01:33:21.203]  In fact, some of them even enjoyed it.
[01:33:21.823 --> 01:33:27.448]  When I was working on the Kennedy assassination thing, I spent a few days with Marina Oswald, who is now named Marina Porter.
[01:33:28.166 --> 01:33:47.693]  And Lee Harvey Oswald's widow, and she's a very nice lady, and she was telling me that when she was in Russia, she asked her grandmother, who was some kind of a clairvoyant or something, and psychic or whatever, why there were such evil people in Russia that could take you to the gulags and shoot you and torture you and do all of these things without any qualms whatsoever, without any compunction.
[01:33:48.348 --> 01:33:53.291]  And her grandmother said, there are people who have no soul and they work for the devil.
[01:33:53.711 --> 01:34:04.197]  And she said that she could look at people and look in their eyes and see that the spark of goodness wasn't there and that these were people who wouldn't think twice about doing anything to anybody, including their own family.
[01:34:04.997 --> 01:34:09.720]  And for lack of a better explanation, I've run into people that way.
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:14.923]  I've put them in jail and I could look in their eyes and tell that if they could get my gun, they'd have shot me in the heart right then.
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:17.220]  And not even felt a thing about it.
[01:34:17.421 --> 01:34:31.825]  So they're out there, and I think that there's ways that they can either screen and recruit these people, you know, find them and put them into special operations type assignments or whatever, or they can program people to be that way to a certain extent.
[01:34:32.954 --> 01:34:48.053]  Well, Pentagon came out in Wired Magazine last year and said that their head futurist, they're actually already drugging the special forces in Afghanistan and giving them amnesiacs and testing this on them.
[01:34:49.795 --> 01:34:56.119]  You know, when you read my book, The Medusa File, and you go into the government guinea pig section and you see all of the things that they've tried on people.
[01:34:56.159 --> 01:34:57.681]  This is our own government doing this stuff.
[01:34:57.701 --> 01:35:13.712]  This is the Technical Services Division of the CIA and other organizations who've gone into things on MKUltra and Clear Eyes and all of these other operations and projects where they've tried to find out if they could create actual Manchurian candidates, programmed assassins, trained killers, super soldiers.
[01:35:13.732 --> 01:35:18.375]  When you were in the sniper corps in Vietnam, and in a minute I'll ask John Moore this,
[01:35:19.843 --> 01:35:29.273]  I mean, when you're there, I mean, obviously, were there those people who were in it just because they liked to kill and who were actually enjoying it?
[01:35:29.574 --> 01:35:30.795]  I mean, not just doing a job?
[01:35:31.636 --> 01:35:33.858]  Well, you know, there was probably a couple over there like that.
[01:35:33.918 --> 01:35:35.200]  I never ran into them personally.
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:37.022]  Everybody that was in sniper duty...
[01:35:37.751 --> 01:35:44.255]  Had some type of a motivation to be able to justify a shot that you can look right up and see a guy's face before you squeeze the trigger.
[01:35:44.495 --> 01:35:48.898]  Unlike standard infantry where you shoot at shadows in the bushes and you don't know if you hit anything or not.
[01:35:48.938 --> 01:35:49.618]  It's not personal.
[01:35:50.038 --> 01:35:50.879]  Sniping is personal.
[01:35:51.179 --> 01:35:55.681]  You know you're going to end some other son's life right there as soon as you squeeze the trigger at 2,800 feet per second.
[01:35:56.902 --> 01:36:03.586]  For me, my personal motivation or my personal excuse or the way I justified my shots is I hated them.
[01:36:04.051 --> 01:36:12.756]  I hated every VC I saw and wanted to kill everyone I could get in my sights because of what they had done to some of my fellow Marines and what they had done to some of the unarmed peaceful villagers that they had tortured.
[01:36:13.136 --> 01:36:15.418]  I saw those things prior to going to sniper school.
[01:36:15.838 --> 01:36:17.719]  There were other guys who couldn't take the shot.
[01:36:17.759 --> 01:36:22.502]  They did the training, they got out in the field and as soon as they saw the face they couldn't take the shot.
[01:36:23.122 --> 01:36:25.003]  But there were some that became very numb to it.
[01:36:25.523 --> 01:36:27.224]  It was just another target.
[01:36:27.344 --> 01:36:31.687]  They just made them targets on the range in their mind and plus they didn't look like us.
[01:36:31.707 --> 01:36:33.708]  They looked like Orientals so that really didn't count.
[01:36:34.298 --> 01:36:42.368]  There's all kinds of ways to justify it mentally, but we didn't have anybody that I personally knew that just said, I want to stay in Vietnam and kill everybody I can because it's fun.
[01:36:42.408 --> 01:36:44.451]  So you didn't run into any horror UGs?
[01:36:45.031 --> 01:36:45.192]  No.
[01:36:45.812 --> 01:36:46.013]  No.
[01:36:47.675 --> 01:36:49.036]  Someday we'll talk about that, Alex.
[01:36:49.076 --> 01:36:50.038]  That's a long story, too.
[01:36:50.769 --> 01:36:51.089]  All right.
[01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:52.850]  Well, Craig, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:54.010]  We'll have you on soon, my friend.
[01:36:54.090 --> 01:36:54.870]  Well, say hi to John.
[01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:55.471]  He's a friend of mine.
[01:36:55.951 --> 01:36:57.271]  Well, hey, say hi to him right now.
[01:36:57.351 --> 01:36:59.772]  John Moore, thanks for holding a few minutes.
[01:36:59.792 --> 01:37:00.472]  Good to have you on.
[01:37:00.672 --> 01:37:01.133]  Thank you.
[01:37:01.353 --> 01:37:02.053]  And hello, Craig.
[01:37:02.293 --> 01:37:02.713]  Hi, John.
[01:37:02.853 --> 01:37:03.653]  Everything going okay?
[01:37:03.953 --> 01:37:04.574]  No complaints.
[01:37:04.814 --> 01:37:05.574]  Now watch Alex.
[01:37:07.034 --> 01:37:07.535]  See you, Craig.
[01:37:07.555 --> 01:37:07.895]  Will do.
[01:37:08.155 --> 01:37:08.675]  Roger that.
[01:37:08.695 --> 01:37:09.855]  All right.
[01:37:09.895 --> 01:37:10.676]  God bless you guys.
[01:37:10.816 --> 01:37:11.396]  Take care, buddy.
[01:37:12.926 --> 01:37:14.667]  John, that's a good way to start this interview.
[01:37:14.687 --> 01:37:18.609]  Of course, John Moore first fought terrorism in 1967.
[01:37:18.649 --> 01:37:22.712]  He is still fighting it today and walking patrol in Vietnam at night alone.
[01:37:22.752 --> 01:37:28.896]  He searched for the terrorist bombs in the jeep and saw what happened to those who did not find them.
[01:37:29.594 --> 01:37:35.598]  And he flew 57 combat missions over Vietnam and Cambodia, many of those being hit by enemy gunfire.
[01:37:36.138 --> 01:37:46.625]  And of course then a police officer, private investigator, special operations, covert operations, psychological operations, undercover operations, surveillance operations, bodyguard for executives.
[01:37:47.305 --> 01:37:55.068]  For stars like Jane Fonda, Charlton Heston, private investigator, firearms instructor, intelligence and analyst, homicide detectives, these are some of the jobs he's done.
[01:37:55.088 --> 01:37:57.749]  Great to have you on the website, thelibertyman.com.
[01:37:57.989 --> 01:37:58.569]  Good to be here.
[01:37:58.589 --> 01:37:59.110]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:37:59.630 --> 01:38:00.110]  You bet.
[01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:03.191]  I mean, I'm sure you heard some of our discussions here.
[01:38:03.271 --> 01:38:11.114]  How do they have feds that will go grab an Oklahoma City cop who's exposing government involvement and torture him to death?
[01:38:11.134 --> 01:38:13.395]  I mean, where are they finding these type of people?
[01:38:15.338 --> 01:38:22.002]  Law enforcement has always attracted people who enjoy exercising power over others.
[01:38:23.743 --> 01:38:38.071]  And frequently, depending on the situation, frequently those kind of people will stick around in situations where other individuals who don't enjoy exercising power will leave and not make it their career.
[01:38:39.182 --> 01:38:47.050]  The worst examples are probably in the penal system where you've got guards and people involved in the penitentiaries.
[01:38:49.953 --> 01:38:59.903]  More likely than not, that's where you're going to find people who really enjoy exercising control and power over other individuals, even more so than regular law enforcement.
[01:39:02.174 --> 01:39:11.357]  So, I mean, most of your cops aren't bad people, but I guess what you're saying is some of the bad, sick apples stick to it, and then kind of the evil people above them position them in positions of power?
[01:39:13.777 --> 01:39:18.019]  Don't fool yourself, Alex, and I know you know this, and this is an educated audience.
[01:39:18.539 --> 01:39:21.059]  At the very top levels, there is true evil.
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:24.100]  And people like Janet Reno, for example.
[01:39:25.541 --> 01:39:26.441]  People who can take...
[01:39:27.310 --> 01:39:34.593]  Well-meaning police officers manipulate and massage what these individuals are doing who have good intent.
[01:39:35.773 --> 01:39:46.458]  It's fairly easy to take a gung-ho patriotic FBI agent and only tell them what you want them to know.
[01:39:47.418 --> 01:39:48.479]  Take Waco, for example.
[01:39:48.519 --> 01:39:50.179]  I know you had a lot of involvement in Waco.
[01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:54.521]  More likely than not, many of the
[01:39:55.367 --> 01:39:55.867]  We're good to go.
[01:39:55.887 --> 01:39:56.388]  We're good to go.
[01:40:25.268 --> 01:40:36.595]  And that's the way you take otherwise honest men, otherwise men who would not do these horrendous things, and get them to do horrendous things, is you exclude the truth.
[01:40:37.115 --> 01:40:38.576]  You only tell them what you want to know.
[01:40:38.716 --> 01:40:40.457]  And we saw the same thing in Germany.
[01:40:40.477 --> 01:40:52.104]  I mean, a lot of these Nazi officers would work 80 hours a week, wouldn't steal a nickel from the Reich, would charge machine gun nests, and then they'd be more than happy to blow toddlers' heads off.
[01:40:53.186 --> 01:40:57.651]  One of the things that you can count on in any war, Alex, is that there will be atrocities.
[01:40:58.392 --> 01:41:06.640]  I've heard it said, and I agree with it, there is no more barbaric person on the planet of the Earth than an 18-year-old farm boy from Iowa who's in the U.S.
[01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:07.441]  Army or the U.S.
[01:41:07.461 --> 01:41:10.224]  Marines, given the right circumstances.
[01:41:11.005 --> 01:41:11.646]  Anybody can...
[01:41:12.964 --> 01:41:21.726]  Under the right circumstances of seeing your buddy's brains blown all over the front of your uniform becomes something you would never dream that you would be otherwise.
[01:41:22.006 --> 01:41:30.629]  Is that why the globalists love to be running dozens of peacekeeping operations at any one time, running checkpoints, grabbing people, setting up Abu Ghraibs, setting up WACOs?
[01:41:31.069 --> 01:41:39.691]  I've heard a lot of top analysts say these are really old mini-war games to test and perfect out a core of people that'll do whatever they're told.
[01:41:40.191 --> 01:41:41.632]  Well, let me give you a heads up on that.
[01:41:41.652 --> 01:41:49.499]  I just finished a nationwide speaking tour the last two weeks of October, speaking on terrorism.
[01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:53.862]  This is from a reliable source who I would trust my life with.
[01:41:53.902 --> 01:41:56.364]  He was in Bosnia on a tour of duty for a year.
[01:41:58.186 --> 01:42:02.509]  He spent a lot of his time doing liaison with the Russian Spetsnaz.
[01:42:03.450 --> 01:42:08.694]  Now, the Spetsnaz over there speak English with the neutral Nebraska accent.
[01:42:09.025 --> 01:42:09.305]  I think so.
[01:42:27.515 --> 01:42:35.077]  Well, Colonel Roberts has been there and his family has been there at the academy just a few years ago where they say, we're going to use foreign assets here.
[01:42:35.117 --> 01:42:40.778]  I saw you and General McKenzie on Nightline the week after 9-11 say we're going to have foreign troops in America.
[01:42:41.058 --> 01:42:45.199]  Now they use them to put out wildfires in 99.
[01:42:45.279 --> 01:42:51.580]  They have the NATO AWACS, the Norwegian F-16s, the cooperative nugget drills.
[01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:57.381]  I've been to the training drills where our Marines train with foreign troops openly for domestic takeover operations
[01:42:57.481 --> 01:42:57.981]  Absolutely.
[01:42:58.041 --> 01:43:00.103]  And you know why they're using Marines and not the Army?
[01:43:00.423 --> 01:43:01.464]  Posse Comensatus.
[01:43:01.524 --> 01:43:02.084]  Precisely.
[01:43:02.524 --> 01:43:11.650]  Now, only less than 1% of the adults in this country are aware of what we're talking about because they listen to Shortwave and they do their research.
[01:43:11.991 --> 01:43:24.479]  The other 99%, given a bad enough circumstance, Alex, specifically nuclear attacks in one or two or more cities, most Americans, 99% of the adults in this country,
[01:43:25.094 --> 01:43:37.139]  Believe that the Russians and the Chinese are our allies, our friends, and they will welcome them with open arms to help restore order, make things normal so they can go to work, pay their mortgage, and have a six-pack of beer and watch football.
[01:43:39.721 --> 01:43:40.841]  Unbelievable.
[01:43:40.861 --> 01:43:43.022]  I mean, you've studied terrorism.
[01:43:43.242 --> 01:43:44.383]  I've heard you interviewed with it.
[01:43:44.403 --> 01:43:44.903]  I've lived with it.
[01:43:45.869 --> 01:43:47.310]  I've read quite a bit of your work.
[01:43:47.591 --> 01:43:59.999]  I mean, what I see happening is 9-11 was just to set up the police state, to set up the mechanisms, you know, to load the round into the chamber, and that the nuclear attack or bio-attack is going to be pulling the trigger.
[01:44:00.139 --> 01:44:00.640]  Absolutely.
[01:44:00.820 --> 01:44:03.042]  And then that's when we go to the real level.
[01:44:03.102 --> 01:44:03.662]  Absolutely.
[01:44:04.523 --> 01:44:11.668]  You and I have both been around this patriot movement enough to have heard men say, well, when those blue helmets had...
[01:44:12.671 --> 01:44:15.813]  Foreign troops come down the street, I'm on a kick butt and take names.
[01:44:16.033 --> 01:44:17.433]  You and I have both heard that, correct?
[01:44:19.034 --> 01:44:21.035]  More times than I'd like to remember.
[01:44:21.355 --> 01:44:25.417]  Alex will be wearing American uniforms and speaking better English than many of us do.
[01:44:26.197 --> 01:44:27.318]  How are you going to know who's who?
[01:44:28.278 --> 01:44:31.960]  Russia, admittedly, has giant fake cities where they teach them this.
[01:44:33.581 --> 01:44:41.765]  Like I say, and this is another heads up, to teach a native-born Slavic-speaking person the Russian language is a Slavic language.
[01:44:42.387 --> 01:44:44.627]  I have friends who grew up speaking Slavic languages.
[01:44:45.488 --> 01:45:06.971]  The only way to teach them to speak English with a Nebraska neutral accent is to start when they're five years old, Alex, which means they do a diagnostic procedure in kindergarten for five-year-olds to pick out who, 13, 14 years in the future, will be the best athletes, will be the brightest young men, who will jump out of airplanes in the middle of the night and kill people.
[01:45:07.331 --> 01:45:08.691]  That's what Spetsnaz does.
[01:45:09.332 --> 01:45:11.632]  And they start teaching them English at that point.
[01:45:12.671 --> 01:45:17.453]  So by the time they're 18, they speak English with no accent whatsoever.
[01:45:20.074 --> 01:45:26.457]  And for people who think this is all a joke, our government is totally run by the European Union now.
[01:45:26.737 --> 01:45:28.417]  They're going to open the door for this.
[01:45:30.398 --> 01:45:39.302]  Well, I don't know how much control they exercised, but there was a presidential directive signed by Clinton which turned over, and it's still secret by the way,
[01:45:40.089 --> 01:45:43.691]  Turned over operational control of our forces to the United Nations.
[01:45:44.252 --> 01:45:48.054]  There's been some declassified summaries released, which are very disturbing.
[01:45:49.015 --> 01:45:53.538]  There is, in fact... Well, then it's not PDD-60 that will absorb a nuclear attack.
[01:45:54.118 --> 01:45:55.079]  And there's that one also.
[01:45:56.465 --> 01:45:59.066]  And we're basically not in a position to stop one.
[01:45:59.106 --> 01:46:01.887]  We do not have an operational strategic defense.
[01:46:02.127 --> 01:46:04.487]  And George Bush never, by the way, reversed any of those.
[01:46:04.768 --> 01:46:05.068]  Oh, no.
[01:46:05.488 --> 01:46:06.308]  Not 25, not 60.
[01:46:06.388 --> 01:46:06.568]  No.
[01:46:06.828 --> 01:46:08.709]  The President's Directive is 25.
[01:46:08.869 --> 01:46:09.609]  It's still in effect.
[01:46:09.629 --> 01:46:10.789]  60 is still in effect.
[01:46:11.530 --> 01:46:19.712]  And all the disastrous things done under William Clinton and the first George Bush to our military have not been reversed.
[01:46:21.101 --> 01:46:23.242]  What's Iraq really all about?
[01:46:23.262 --> 01:46:26.283]  I mean, when the Army said we need 400,000, they said, no, we need 150.
[01:46:26.323 --> 01:46:31.644]  I mean, obviously, they know that the tactics they're using over there are meant to backfire.
[01:46:32.165 --> 01:46:39.267]  Actually, our top generals in the Pentagon wanted about a quarter of a million troops to do what's being done over there right now with half that many.
[01:46:40.627 --> 01:46:43.028]  I think the answer is lying in several ways.
[01:46:43.596 --> 01:46:48.558]  The book I'm in the middle of right now is Crossing the Rubicon by Michael Rupert.
[01:46:49.058 --> 01:46:50.799]  I think you can find some answers in there.
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:57.902]  It's too simplistic just to say oil, although oil is obviously part of it.
[01:46:59.923 --> 01:47:06.606]  The politics behind oil are complex and almost beyond human imagination.
[01:47:07.336 --> 01:47:13.960]  But you need to do some research and study to really figure out the motivations behind what's going on in Iraq.
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:24.227]  Or go to the PNAG documents where Dick Cheney said it's about oil, but it's mainly about having a military base to invade other countries, and then America plays the part of the bad cop, Europe plays the part of the good cop.
[01:47:26.048 --> 01:47:27.069]  It's playing out that way.
[01:47:27.089 --> 01:47:32.192]  Europe hasn't stepped in to be the good cop yet, but that obviously could be their role.
[01:47:33.371 --> 01:47:39.000]  Well, now again, we're talking to John Moore and the website celebrityman.com.
[01:47:40.181 --> 01:47:41.984]  John, what was your awakening like?
[01:47:44.268 --> 01:47:48.933]  My awakening was as follows.
[01:47:49.053 --> 01:47:53.417]  I was a 20-year-old corporal working in military intelligence in the fall of 1967.
[01:47:53.997 --> 01:48:05.328]  I was getting report after report about the Viet Cong building up for a major offensive during a Chinese New Year celebration called Tet in the end of January of 1968.
[01:48:06.629 --> 01:48:09.051]  I saw during the fall of 1967 a couple of things.
[01:48:09.111 --> 01:48:09.652]  First of all,
[01:48:10.385 --> 01:48:10.866]  We're good to go.
[01:48:10.886 --> 01:48:11.026]  I think?
[01:48:27.248 --> 01:48:27.649]  I think so.
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:45.143]  Well, of course, in the January 68, the Tet Offensive came.
[01:48:45.163 --> 01:48:49.006]  They did hit us hard, and a lot of men died that did not need to.
[01:48:49.026 --> 01:48:51.448]  And I was aware of it months before it happened.
[01:48:51.468 --> 01:48:53.389]  And the Pentagon knew it, too.
[01:48:54.090 --> 01:49:02.657]  CBS did a documentary on the disparity between Westmoreland's intelligence people and the CIA's intelligence people.
[01:49:02.977 --> 01:49:04.378]  The CIA was telling the truth.
[01:49:05.039 --> 01:49:07.701]  They said, these people are going to hit you hard during the Tet.
[01:49:08.911 --> 01:49:13.780]  Westmoreland's intelligence officer said, no, it's not going to happen, and of course we saw the results.
[01:49:15.643 --> 01:49:21.194]  And then never allowing our forces to win the war, to drag it out, what's the policy behind that?
[01:49:23.378 --> 01:49:24.119]  It was politics.
[01:49:24.199 --> 01:49:29.943]  It was Lyndon Johnson wanting to have it both ways, the guns and butter policies.
[01:49:30.283 --> 01:49:43.032]  He really was a Roosevelt type of Democrat where he wanted to create all these social programs and conduct the war at the same time and not get Russia and China upset with us.
[01:49:43.372 --> 01:49:44.413]  We're about to go to break.
[01:49:44.473 --> 01:49:49.477]  We'll come right back and get into a whole host of issues with John Moore.
[01:49:49.897 --> 01:49:52.099]  I'm Alex Jones, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:49:52.139 --> 01:49:52.539]  Check it out.
[01:49:54.207 --> 01:49:57.130]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:49:57.791 --> 01:49:59.092]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:49:59.292 --> 01:50:05.038]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:50:05.298 --> 01:50:10.563]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:50:10.844 --> 01:50:14.968]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:50:15.148 --> 01:50:18.952]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:50:19.193 --> 01:50:23.838]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:50:23.938 --> 01:50:30.205]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.245 --> 01:50:32.067]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:51:06.363 --> 01:51:11.029]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:11.509 --> 01:51:18.212]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:18.612 --> 01:51:30.418]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:30.878 --> 01:51:35.341]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:53:02.264 --> 01:53:04.285]  We'll be taking your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:09.798 --> 01:53:12.079]  Before we go back to Mr. Moore, just briefly.
[01:53:13.139 --> 01:53:14.440]  You know I've made 11 films.
[01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:20.242]  The latest film is American Dictators, documented in the staged election of 2004.
[01:53:20.702 --> 01:53:25.364]  It shows how there was no real difference, just in rhetoric, how they're setting up the same police state.
[01:53:26.244 --> 01:53:29.806]  And it's really important for people that aren't understanding the political system.
[01:53:30.966 --> 01:53:34.328]  It's $5.95 on DVD when you buy one copy for $19.95.
[01:53:34.388 --> 01:53:37.789]  So you can buy a whole bunch of copies and give them as gifts.
[01:53:39.292 --> 01:53:45.076]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, that covers the history of government-sponsored terror in 9-11.
[01:53:45.096 --> 01:53:47.118]  $24.95, almost three hours long, each additional copy $5.95.
[01:53:47.758 --> 01:53:50.460]  I'm only doing this for a week or two more.
[01:53:52.061 --> 01:53:54.983]  And I hope you take advantage of this, and I hope you get them and give them to people.
[01:53:55.023 --> 01:53:57.665]  Or just buy one copy and burn copies, make copies of them.
[01:53:58.553 --> 01:54:00.334]  Toll-free number to order, 1-888-253-3139.

[01:54:04.716 --> 01:54:13.799]  Also, it's not going to be out for a few months, but my new video, Martial Law 9-11, Rise of the Police State, a four and a half minute trailer of that.
[01:54:23.358 --> 01:54:29.720]  For Macs and PCs, it's on Infowars.com right now, and I'm proud of it, and I hope you'll spread it around to your email list.
[01:54:30.181 --> 01:54:34.802]  And next hour, we'll tell you how to get some of John Moore's incredible works that are very impressive.
[01:54:35.502 --> 01:54:41.565]  John, you want to get into something that's near and dear to my heart, and everybody should be concerned about it.
[01:54:41.865 --> 01:54:51.228]  The coming mass terror attacks, it's not a question of if but when, the globalists have told us, in kind of a thumbnail sketch, what are we going to be covering in the next hour?
[01:54:52.728 --> 01:55:03.291]  Alex, what we're going to cover is, first of all, emphasizing to all the listeners that we don't need to dwell too much on the nuances of which entity would be behind it.
[01:55:04.371 --> 01:55:05.331]  It serves no purpose.
[01:55:05.411 --> 01:55:07.772]  It's kind of fun, but it really serves no purpose.
[01:55:08.572 --> 01:55:16.734]  And concentrate on these attacks will be happening and what people need to do to get prepared because the government won't be there to take care of them.
[01:55:18.132 --> 01:55:24.254]  Yeah, even if people believe that Al-Qaeda's real and operates alone and does this for McCabe, it's still going to have the same effect.
[01:55:24.454 --> 01:55:25.014]  Absolutely.
[01:55:26.134 --> 01:55:26.595]  Absolutely.
[01:55:26.755 --> 01:55:38.498]  The government's still doing nothing to really protect you, leaving the borders wide open and taking your rights and prosecuting people for Rubik's Cubes and complaining to the VA and pot dealing.
[01:55:38.558 --> 01:55:41.119]  They're obviously using it for a New World Order.
[01:55:41.399 --> 01:55:41.639]  Absolutely.
[01:55:44.497 --> 01:55:45.678]  So what do you see happening?
[01:55:45.718 --> 01:55:50.321]  I mean, you talk about, you know, which group, you know, debating all day who exactly runs it all.
[01:55:51.021 --> 01:56:02.549]  Well, the water cooler talk, as we sometimes refer to it around the lettered agencies, is nuclear weapons, not dirty bombs, but real nuclear weapons being discharged in major American cities.
[01:56:03.650 --> 01:56:05.971]  That's what the water cooler talk is in the agencies.
[01:56:06.752 --> 01:56:14.217]  And the speculation is on, first of all, how many of these devices are, and, of course, the big question is when would they be discharged.
[01:56:14.861 --> 01:56:17.683]  Which, if anybody has that information, they haven't told me.
[01:56:19.104 --> 01:56:23.947]  Those nuclear weapons, Alex, are the true weapons of mass destruction.
[01:56:24.047 --> 01:56:29.591]  They would cause the greatest amount of terror in the quickest period of time.
[01:56:30.492 --> 01:56:40.318]  Granted, these biological weapons, especially these cocktail mixes the Russians have developed, are absolutely devastating, and some of them approach 100% lethality.
[01:56:42.324 --> 01:56:44.406]  With a chemical, you get tens of thousands.
[01:56:44.446 --> 01:56:46.287]  With a super bio, hundreds of thousands.
[01:56:46.307 --> 01:56:47.268]  And with nukes, millions.
[01:56:48.149 --> 01:56:49.991]  Chemicals are very difficult to use.
[01:56:50.251 --> 01:56:53.413]  On the battlefield, the main purpose they serve is area denial.
[01:56:53.453 --> 01:56:59.559]  Say you've got an airport that you want to deny access to the enemy, but you don't want to wreck the place.
[01:57:00.199 --> 01:57:05.143]  Chemicals are an excellent thing to use because you can't conduct operations as long as the chemicals are there.
[01:57:05.183 --> 01:57:07.065]  It denies your enemy use of that facility.
[01:57:07.529 --> 01:57:07.829]  I think so.
[01:57:31.590 --> 01:57:34.934]  You really can't tell what you've got and you're dead before they figure it out.
[01:57:34.954 --> 01:57:35.534]  Yeah, stay there.
[01:57:35.594 --> 01:57:36.135]  We'll come back.
[01:57:36.455 --> 01:57:37.937]  They say watch the reservoirs.
[01:57:38.237 --> 01:57:40.820]  You just pump it down the sink or the toilet.
[01:57:41.341 --> 01:57:49.710]  We'll be back.
[01:57:49.930 --> 01:57:50.531]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.218 --> 01:57:52.279]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.999 --> 01:57:54.080]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.740 --> 01:57:55.601]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.621 --> 01:57:57.222]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.722 --> 01:58:01.564]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.085 --> 01:58:06.187]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.548 --> 01:58:11.390]  Well, it's serious issues we're discussing today.
[01:58:12.050 --> 01:58:16.293]  The globalists want bigger terror to re-engineer our society forever.
[01:58:17.742 --> 01:58:34.769]  The day the suitcase nukes go off in cities like Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, some of the cities listed by the globalists, and the day those go off is the day America dies because they've set up a system to totally take your liberties and freedoms when that happens.
[01:58:34.789 --> 01:58:37.110]  It has nothing to do with stopping terrorism.
[01:58:37.150 --> 01:58:37.990]  They could stop it.
[01:58:38.711 --> 01:58:40.591]  The globalists have no intention of stopping it.
[01:58:40.611 --> 01:58:42.252]  9-11 is only the setup for this.
[01:58:42.952 --> 01:58:44.273]  We're now into the third hour.
[01:58:44.993 --> 01:58:46.534]  We're talking to John R. Moore.
[01:58:47.395 --> 01:59:02.141]  And again, Vietnam veterans, special operations, covert operations, psychological operations, undercover operations, surveillance operations, bodyguards, executive stars like Jane Fonda and Charlton Heston, private investigator, firearms instructor, intelligence analyst, and homicide detective.
[01:59:02.462 --> 01:59:04.443]  These are the jobs that have kept J.R.
[01:59:04.483 --> 01:59:04.863]  busy.
[01:59:06.143 --> 01:59:08.964]  And we are honored to have J.R.
[01:59:08.984 --> 01:59:09.865]  Moore on with us.
[01:59:10.945 --> 01:59:13.367]  And he's an author and, of course, lecturer.
[01:59:14.308 --> 01:59:21.215]  J.R., laying out the threats we face, and as you said, the government isn't there to protect us, aren't going to protect us, can't protect us.
[01:59:21.915 --> 01:59:23.057]  Number one, why do you say that?
[01:59:23.957 --> 01:59:26.600]  Well, I say it because the mission statement of FEMA...
[01:59:27.921 --> 01:59:31.183]  It is much different than the old civil defense that they took the place of.
[01:59:31.644 --> 01:59:41.651]  The mission statement of civil defense was to provide facilities, including shelters, stocked with food, medical supplies, cots, and blankets to take care of the citizens of this country.
[01:59:42.812 --> 01:59:48.076]  The mission statement of FEMA is to guarantee the continuity of government.
[01:59:48.476 --> 01:59:49.957]  That's their primary mission statement.
[01:59:50.477 --> 01:59:52.559]  Now, they will come in and provide training
[01:59:53.662 --> 02:00:00.387]  To state and local governments, but they don't really have the resources that civil defense used to.
[02:00:00.527 --> 02:00:02.909]  But really, that's just training them how to be federalized.
[02:00:03.690 --> 02:00:04.390]  And that's part of it.
[02:00:04.951 --> 02:00:06.111]  Absolutely, that is part of it.
[02:00:06.952 --> 02:00:14.297]  They want these state and local governments, people to be used to command and control coming from the federals.
[02:00:14.998 --> 02:00:16.339]  And that's certainly part of it.
[02:00:19.404 --> 02:00:19.965]  Unbelievable.
[02:00:20.025 --> 02:00:24.608]  In fact, I've looked at some of the public major disaster and terror attack drills they've done.
[02:00:24.628 --> 02:00:26.670]  It is not to protect the people.
[02:00:27.070 --> 02:00:27.971]  It's to protect the government.
[02:00:28.651 --> 02:00:29.592]  Well, that's what I said.
[02:00:29.612 --> 02:00:32.514]  That's their mission statement is to guarantee the continuity of government.
[02:00:32.534 --> 02:00:33.975]  And they do that very effectively.
[02:00:34.575 --> 02:00:40.860]  They don't have the resources to provide food, shelter, medical supplies for average citizens.
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:42.802]  It simply does not exist.
[02:00:43.722 --> 02:00:47.025]  The state and local governments have those facilities to a limited degree.
[02:00:47.565 --> 02:00:48.306]  Very limited.
[02:00:49.482 --> 02:00:50.062]  Alex Jones Show!
[02:01:10.718 --> 02:01:20.807]  Well, with the depression, with 90% of the public knowing how to garden or ranch or farm, and people being very moral, we had almost complete breakdown and starvation.
[02:01:21.107 --> 02:01:28.394]  Today, with a spoiled, yuppie population that knows how to watch Fear Factor but doesn't know how to tie their shoelaces, we're looking at total breakdown.
[02:01:29.094 --> 02:01:29.635]  Absolutely.
[02:01:29.715 --> 02:01:34.479]  I do a lot of preparedness training, and whenever I'm working with a client of mine,
[02:01:35.177 --> 02:01:44.945]  A female client under the age of 40, especially under the age of 30, the topic of her husband or boyfriend comes up almost without exception.
[02:01:45.626 --> 02:01:57.255]  These young women will say, �He's useless.� Young men today grow up not having the skills that were common and routine for young men growing up in this country 30 years ago.
[02:01:57.635 --> 02:01:59.056]  They can't change a spark plug.
[02:01:59.357 --> 02:02:02.839]  They can't do common skills involving hand tools.
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:04.521]  They're simply almost useless.
[02:02:06.957 --> 02:02:07.798]  It's unbelievable.
[02:02:09.078 --> 02:02:18.303]  I mean, I'm proficient with firearms and know how to farm and ranch, and I know how to screw in a light bulb, but I'm not very technical.
[02:02:18.543 --> 02:02:21.265]  And my dad can basically fix anything because he grew up on a farm.
[02:02:21.665 --> 02:02:28.369]  Well, farmers have the skills, and most of farming involves equipment, maintenance, and repair.
[02:02:28.549 --> 02:02:29.369]  And that's disappeared.
[02:02:30.450 --> 02:02:34.152]  Well, we have a lot less farmers, but the farmers that are here still have those skills.
[02:02:34.898 --> 02:02:42.441]  We'll come back and talk about this and what it would look like in the first week, say, if three cities got hit by suitcase nukes.
[02:02:42.681 --> 02:02:43.261]  What would happen?
[02:02:45.402 --> 02:02:49.744]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:49.924 --> 02:02:54.366]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.506 --> 02:02:58.887]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:58.927 --> 02:03:00.248]  The New World Order.
[02:03:02.050 --> 02:03:06.274]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.334 --> 02:03:13.282]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.402 --> 02:03:15.405]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:16.625 --> 02:03:26.210]  The new prison economy, the total information society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:31.773]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:04:45.538 --> 02:04:47.059]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:04:47.119 --> 02:04:49.520]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[02:04:49.881 --> 02:04:50.741]  Let me rephrase that.
[02:04:51.121 --> 02:04:52.362]  Oil War III has started.
[02:04:52.642 --> 02:04:55.084]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[02:04:55.504 --> 02:04:58.906]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[02:04:59.326 --> 02:05:03.168]  Why else would the US be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[02:05:03.409 --> 02:05:04.669]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[02:05:05.110 --> 02:05:09.592]  The nations of the Earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[02:05:10.033 --> 02:05:13.995]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[02:05:14.535 --> 02:05:20.438]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.
[02:05:20.678 --> 02:05:26.781]  Call Ready Reserves at 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the free booklet and what you can do to prepare.
[02:05:27.301 --> 02:05:27.621]  That's 800-453-2202.
[02:05:27.681 --> 02:05:33.544]  After you read the booklet, you will understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[02:05:33.984 --> 02:05:34.204]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[02:05:34.224 --> 02:05:35.885]  Or email your request to ReadyReserves at AOL.com.
[02:05:35.905 --> 02:05:36.225]  That's 800-453-2202.
[02:05:46.559 --> 02:05:52.580]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:56.241]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:57.261 --> 02:06:02.882]  That's right, broadcasting from the occupied United States, occupied by the globalists and their crime syndicates.
[02:06:04.622 --> 02:06:06.003]  Think about this, my friends.
[02:06:06.183 --> 02:06:13.284]  Last year when they had the blackouts in the eastern area of the country, even spanning into Michigan, just for a day,
[02:06:15.102 --> 02:06:16.623]  Society almost unraveled.
[02:06:18.205 --> 02:06:23.210]  Now, think about people in these megacities of 10 million, 5 million people.
[02:06:25.592 --> 02:06:30.156]  Even if you knew how to work on a car, you can't work on the new cars made in the last 10 years.
[02:06:31.337 --> 02:06:34.300]  People don't even know the basics of survival.
[02:06:34.821 --> 02:06:39.205]  The grocery stores have got two, three days maximum of food on them.
[02:06:40.660 --> 02:06:49.109]  About, what, 60% of our farming now is done by the big mega companies, and that's done with a lot of immigrant labor that's brought in.
[02:06:52.072 --> 02:06:58.378]  Argentina, the globalists, we got their own documents, pulled the rug out from under them economically by design.
[02:06:58.418 --> 02:07:00.921]  Joseph Sicklitz resigned and all this stuff went public.
[02:07:01.241 --> 02:07:02.943]  We had BBC reporters on covering it.
[02:07:04.449 --> 02:07:27.337]  And it went from yuppies, and they were the most industrialized, most wealthy country in Latin America, almost as wealthy as we are, on average, and literally there were Washington Post articles describing a tractor-trailer tumping over with cows, and the former middle class running up with crude knives, grabbing globs of raw meat, chopping it off, cramming it in their mouths.
[02:07:29.318 --> 02:07:32.499]  Again, in the Depression, 90% of people had skills.
[02:07:33.550 --> 02:07:36.672]  Now, I've got more skills than most people my age.
[02:07:36.872 --> 02:07:47.920]  I don't have very many skills compared to my father, who literally had to fix combines and work on tractors and roof houses and lasso cows.
[02:07:50.342 --> 02:07:52.183]  We have turned into a bunch of jellyfish.
[02:07:52.703 --> 02:08:03.588]  And the globalists are feeding into this, building these complex, compact cities for control, and then doing nothing to protect us from the threat of terrorism, actually fostering it and pushing it.
[02:08:04.048 --> 02:08:05.469]  Any comments to that?
[02:08:05.669 --> 02:08:09.410]  Our expert we have in-house with us, John Moore, expert on terrorism.
[02:08:09.870 --> 02:08:13.472]  And what do you see happening if those three nukes go off in our cities?
[02:08:13.512 --> 02:08:17.874]  What will happen in the first week, then the first month, and then what will America look like in a year?
[02:08:18.654 --> 02:08:19.214]  Okay, Alex.
[02:08:19.475 --> 02:08:26.258]  When the first nuclear device is discharged, there would be martial law declared in that region.
[02:08:27.158 --> 02:08:28.619]  Say, you mentioned Chicago.
[02:08:28.639 --> 02:08:34.802]  Cook County and all the surrounding counties, there would be martial law declared immediately in those counties.
[02:08:35.202 --> 02:08:37.503]  Let's talk about the type of nuke we'd be looking at, too.
[02:08:37.523 --> 02:08:41.725]  If it was a suitcase and it detonated at ground zero, what would be the blast radius of that?
[02:08:42.825 --> 02:08:44.887]  Suitcase nuke could take out about a city block.
[02:08:45.427 --> 02:09:02.540]  It could be downtown, it could be in the suburbs, but the complete devastation would be about one city block with another eight to ten city blocks sustaining a lot of damage and another radius beyond that where there would be high radiation and some damage.
[02:09:03.341 --> 02:09:06.463]  Now, if you're looking at a device, it could be as small as a soccer ball to do that.
[02:09:07.984 --> 02:09:08.725]  That's all it takes.
[02:09:10.183 --> 02:09:17.190]  Now, if they were able to have a suicide pilot get up at a couple thousand feet and airburst it, we'd be looking at ten times the damage.
[02:09:19.211 --> 02:09:29.261]  The damage on the ground wouldn't be as great, but the radiation would be spread out a bit more in terms of the instant radiation.
[02:09:29.881 --> 02:09:33.805]  The ground burst would put more particulate up in the air.
[02:09:34.585 --> 02:09:38.408]  That would become radioactive, and of course that would spread out over a wide area.
[02:09:38.428 --> 02:09:48.656]  You're more of an expert on this than I am in military intelligence, so you're saying that an airburst, because I'd always read from experts that an airburst would be worse.
[02:09:49.497 --> 02:09:50.878]  It depends on the size of the device.
[02:09:52.575 --> 02:10:06.218]  If you've got a 20-megaton or a 50-megaton device, your airburst could be 1,000 feet above ground, above ground level, and have a much greater devastation in terms of knocking down buildings.
[02:10:08.318 --> 02:10:16.200]  A smaller device, which a suitcase nuke is sometimes referred to, could only be 1 to 5 kilotons, which is no small thing.
[02:10:17.530 --> 02:10:23.973]  It would destroy, like I said, a city block and throw up all the dirt and debris it threw up in the air.
[02:10:23.993 --> 02:10:25.314]  It would all become radioactive.
[02:10:25.594 --> 02:10:27.895]  That doesn't happen as much in an airburst.
[02:10:28.415 --> 02:10:30.516]  Yeah, you don't have it binding with the surrounding metals.
[02:10:31.477 --> 02:10:36.399]  Well, the radioactivity has... Something has to become radioactive.
[02:10:36.739 --> 02:10:37.980]  It has to be particulate.
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.481]  It has to be some kind of physical matter.
[02:10:41.401 --> 02:10:43.442]  So going back to what you were saying, this goes off...
[02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:48.962]  50,000 to 100,000 people of us in a big, dense area would be killed instantly?
[02:10:49.423 --> 02:10:49.803]  Could be.
[02:10:50.443 --> 02:10:53.886]  In a densely populated area, that's a possibility.
[02:10:53.926 --> 02:11:02.492]  Now, like I mentioned, the martial law would be declared instantly for a radius of the immediate county and the surrounding counties.
[02:11:02.532 --> 02:11:09.756]  Now, if a second one went off a week later, or a day later, you'd probably see nationwide martial law declared at that point.
[02:11:09.837 --> 02:11:12.739]  And by then you'd already see the stock market completely tank?
[02:11:13.999 --> 02:11:14.800]  At some point in there.
[02:11:15.603 --> 02:11:22.209]  Yes, at some point, especially if it went off in Manhattan, of course.
[02:11:22.569 --> 02:11:36.742]  Something to keep in mind, this is part of what I point out to my audience, is Alex, if it's truly an Arabic terrorist event, as opposed to some other contrived event, there's two audiences.
[02:11:36.822 --> 02:11:41.446]  The first audience, of course, is the American audience and the American economy.
[02:11:41.707 --> 02:11:42.127]  They want to
[02:11:42.868 --> 02:11:44.989]  Terrorize Americans and hurt the American economy.
[02:11:45.009 --> 02:11:46.130]  That's the first audience.
[02:11:46.610 --> 02:11:48.551]  The second audience is the Arabic world.
[02:11:49.571 --> 02:11:52.813]  That's why they pick these high-profile targets like the World Trade Center.
[02:11:52.893 --> 02:11:56.775]  The second audience, the terrorists want to impress the second audience.
[02:11:57.776 --> 02:11:58.356]  I'm powerful.
[02:11:58.536 --> 02:11:59.336]  I can do things.
[02:11:59.556 --> 02:12:00.237]  Give me your money.
[02:12:00.277 --> 02:12:01.137]  Give me your children.
[02:12:02.098 --> 02:12:03.058]  That's the second audience.
[02:12:03.078 --> 02:12:10.542]  That's why they pick high-profile targets that can be recognized in dirt poor villages and remote Islamic areas.
[02:12:12.512 --> 02:12:15.235]  Well, from my sources, it's San Francisco, L.A.
[02:12:15.395 --> 02:12:16.516]  I mean, it's the obvious ones.
[02:12:17.277 --> 02:12:18.117]  Chicago.
[02:12:18.998 --> 02:12:22.622]  The CFR keeps saying Denver and Cleveland and Dallas for some reason.
[02:12:23.242 --> 02:12:23.723]  Houston.
[02:12:24.864 --> 02:12:29.028]  All those cities you mentioned are easily recognized.
[02:12:29.048 --> 02:12:29.909]  And obviously, D.C.
[02:12:29.989 --> 02:12:30.809]  is the main target.
[02:12:30.909 --> 02:12:32.311]  Well, D.C.
[02:12:32.431 --> 02:12:33.352]  and Manhattan for...
[02:12:34.219 --> 02:12:34.899]  Obvious reasons.
[02:12:35.359 --> 02:12:43.021]  All those targets that you mentioned can be recognized in the most remote village with no electricity and dirt roads in these Islamic countries.
[02:12:43.461 --> 02:12:45.222]  So they serve both purposes.
[02:12:45.802 --> 02:12:56.805]  To have one go off in Springfield, Missouri would serve no purpose as far as that second audience because these Islamic people don't know what Springfield, Missouri is or where it is.
[02:12:58.098 --> 02:13:07.043]  Now, and then again, even if the globalists were behind this, they also in their P2OG plan want to stir up and create an Islamic jihad.
[02:13:07.103 --> 02:13:15.288]  So even if it was the globalists doing it, which that's what we're looking at here from all the evidence, it would also probably be the same target as well.
[02:13:15.408 --> 02:13:16.108]  Absolutely.
[02:13:16.268 --> 02:13:17.669]  It would fit that profile.
[02:13:17.869 --> 02:13:18.410]  Absolutely.
[02:13:18.710 --> 02:13:19.090]  Okay.
[02:13:19.130 --> 02:13:24.113]  Now, so a week into this, several devices go off.
[02:13:24.133 --> 02:13:25.814]  That's what we keep getting into.
[02:13:25.834 --> 02:13:27.635]  Life in this country would change forever, Alex.
[02:13:29.900 --> 02:13:34.669]  You and I would not live long enough to ever see a society the way it was that we've been used to.
[02:13:35.270 --> 02:13:36.032]  It would change forever.
[02:13:38.829 --> 02:13:40.830]  And they tried to get that shift after 9-11.
[02:13:40.850 --> 02:13:42.091]  Oh, life has changed.
[02:13:42.131 --> 02:13:42.792]  Get used to it.
[02:13:42.872 --> 02:13:44.973]  But again, as you agree with me, that's a precursor.
[02:13:45.474 --> 02:13:45.754]  Oh, yeah.
[02:13:45.874 --> 02:13:46.834]  That's just a warm-up.
[02:13:47.355 --> 02:13:48.335]  That's a warm-up event.
[02:13:49.036 --> 02:13:58.943]  And, of course... Well, let's extrapolate out then from what we know FEMA will do and what others will do, how this extrapolates out to the public preparation for foreign troop occupation.
[02:14:01.744 --> 02:14:06.908]  The public will demand and the government will be expected to restore order, to have...
[02:14:08.064 --> 02:14:13.495]  If there's rioting as a result, for example, of these events, whether it's contrived rioting or spontaneous rioting.
[02:14:13.976 --> 02:14:17.063]  We had contrived rioting in LA after the Rodney King verdict.
[02:14:19.164 --> 02:14:22.346]  People will want and people will expect the government to restore order.
[02:14:22.766 --> 02:14:23.707]  And whatever it takes.
[02:14:23.727 --> 02:14:34.093]  If it takes Russian troops or Chinese troops on the street corners so people can go to work, pay their mortgage, and pick up a steak and a six-pack of beer on the way home, they will accept that.
[02:14:34.113 --> 02:14:38.896]  99% of the people in this country will accept whatever it takes to restore order.
[02:14:42.998 --> 02:14:48.443]  Again, for those that are listening to this, if they're thinking, Red Dawn, that'll never happen, that's crazy, our government won't let this happen.
[02:14:48.563 --> 02:14:51.946]  Well, the people that own and run this government, whether it's Bush or Kerry, they're just puppets.
[02:14:52.346 --> 02:14:54.688]  The globalists really have been making these preparations.
[02:14:54.748 --> 02:14:58.652]  I mean, now we've got the EU taking over for NATO in countries all over the world.
[02:14:58.672 --> 02:14:59.693]  I mean, this is already happening.
[02:15:00.513 --> 02:15:02.595]  Well, NATO, of course, is part of the United Nations.
[02:15:03.656 --> 02:15:06.158]  And the EU is becoming very, very strong.
[02:15:06.178 --> 02:15:10.082]  What we're going to end up with, Alex, is ten regions of ten countries.
[02:15:11.090 --> 02:15:14.912]  And, of course, the EU is becoming the biggest and most important one.
[02:15:15.652 --> 02:15:21.635]  The one comprising China and India is up and coming.
[02:15:21.655 --> 02:15:24.637]  It's certainly a huge economic area as well.
[02:15:27.038 --> 02:15:30.420]  What do you see happening a month after the event takes place?
[02:15:30.460 --> 02:15:33.962]  Because, I mean, obviously food service, water delivery is going to start breaking down.
[02:15:35.423 --> 02:15:37.143]  The infrastructure is at risk.
[02:15:37.323 --> 02:15:40.145]  And here's how I explain to people.
[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:52.887]  Say you're living in a remote village in West Texas, and you might be saying to yourself and your family, well, I'm glad we're not living anywhere near a terrorist target.
[02:15:53.328 --> 02:16:03.634]  Well, let's say you have a family member who takes, say, products, let's say Synthroid, which is synthetic thyroid medicine for people who don't have a thyroid.
[02:16:04.114 --> 02:16:05.876]  It only comes from one place.
[02:16:05.896 --> 02:16:07.997]  There's a factory near Detroit that makes it.
[02:16:09.574 --> 02:16:20.237]  Your stocking, I should say your pharmacy out there in West Texas carries a two to four week supply of any given pharmaceutical product for the following two reasons.
[02:16:20.757 --> 02:16:21.657]  One, it's expensive.
[02:16:21.697 --> 02:16:22.597]  Two, it goes bad.
[02:16:22.977 --> 02:16:27.899]  And three, why would you carry a large inventory of stuff that goes bad and costs a lot of money?
[02:16:29.659 --> 02:16:36.561]  That pharmacy in West Texas in turn gets their supplies from a stocking warehouse somewhere within 80 to 100 miles most likely.
[02:16:38.163 --> 02:16:38.683]  Fuel delivery.
[02:17:03.726 --> 02:17:05.928]  Transportation are telecommunications.
[02:17:06.349 --> 02:17:09.412]  Obviously, fuel is in there, and that falls under transportation.
[02:17:10.453 --> 02:17:14.657]  Anything that disrupts any one of those three things knocks out the other two.
[02:17:14.677 --> 02:17:17.720]  The power grid, telecommunications, and transportation.
[02:17:19.982 --> 02:17:23.085]  We'll be right back with John Moore, expert on terrorism.
[02:17:24.686 --> 02:17:27.269]  And we'll read this Henry Kissinger quote when we get back.
[02:17:28.365 --> 02:17:29.527]  We'll continue with this discussion.
[02:17:29.587 --> 02:17:31.489]  Your calls are coming up at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:32.351 --> 02:17:36.537]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:17:36.617 --> 02:17:38.239]  Infowars.com.
[02:17:38.299 --> 02:17:39.421]  Got some new updates there.
[02:17:39.821 --> 02:17:41.123]  Definitely want to be checking that out.
[02:17:41.263 --> 02:17:42.405]  PrisonPlanet.tv as well.
[02:17:45.504 --> 02:17:49.087]  Every hour of every day, someone out there is suffering from hemorrhoids.
[02:17:49.388 --> 02:17:51.910]  The pain, worry, and embarrassment can be devastating.
[02:17:52.090 --> 02:18:00.438]  For almost a decade, our customers have used Hemtab's natural formula to treat the problem at its source, to provide long-lasting relief in even the most severe of cases.
[02:18:00.698 --> 02:18:03.640]  My husband had been suffering from a painful hemorrhoid for years.
[02:18:04.001 --> 02:18:06.703]  After the doctor recommended surgery, we didn't know what to do.
[02:18:07.064 --> 02:18:10.787]  I ordered Hemtab online, and soon after taking Hemtab, the pain was gone.
[02:18:11.047 --> 02:18:12.989]  A few days later, the hemorrhoid began to shrink.
[02:18:13.269 --> 02:18:13.710]  Miracle?
[02:18:13.950 --> 02:18:15.091]  Hem miracle, we call it.
[02:18:15.311 --> 02:18:16.092]  Thanks, Hemtab.
[02:18:16.252 --> 02:18:17.934]  If you're suffering, there's no need to wait.
[02:18:18.074 --> 02:18:20.876]  We know how the discomfort of hemorrhoids can interrupt your life.

[02:18:47.531 --> 02:18:52.133]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[02:18:52.473 --> 02:18:54.793]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[02:18:55.013 --> 02:18:56.554]  Achieve financial independence.
[02:18:56.934 --> 02:19:02.015]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[02:19:02.335 --> 02:19:03.555]  Get the Red Book of the U.S.
[02:19:03.615 --> 02:19:06.316]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[02:19:06.716 --> 02:19:12.659]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book, along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.

[02:19:17.942 --> 02:19:25.787]  I can tell you there will be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.

[02:19:45.146 --> 02:19:48.608]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:19:48.868 --> 02:19:52.369]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:19:52.469 --> 02:19:56.411]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:19:56.631 --> 02:20:02.813]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:20:03.194 --> 02:20:11.117]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:20:11.537 --> 02:20:16.883]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:20:17.043 --> 02:20:20.807]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:20:21.167 --> 02:20:23.069]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[02:20:23.089 --> 02:20:25.271]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:20:25.511 --> 02:20:30.436]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[02:20:37.244 --> 02:20:38.806]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:20:43.863 --> 02:20:46.904]  You and your family members getting enough minerals on the daily diet?
[02:20:47.285 --> 02:20:49.806]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[02:20:50.026 --> 02:20:57.089]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[02:20:57.289 --> 02:21:00.570]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[02:21:00.830 --> 02:21:02.851]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[02:21:03.192 --> 02:21:10.995]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[02:21:11.135 --> 02:21:11.855]  We're good to go.
[02:21:41.415 --> 02:21:52.060]  SeenMineral.com Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:52.560 --> 02:21:55.921]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:57.082 --> 02:22:04.245]  Today, America will be outraged if United Nations troops enter Los Angeles to restore order.
[02:22:05.399 --> 02:22:07.060]  Tomorrow they will be grateful.
[02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:16.948]  This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence.
[02:22:17.628 --> 02:22:22.672]  It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil.
[02:22:23.352 --> 02:22:27.115]  The one thing that every man fears is the unknown.
[02:22:27.455 --> 02:22:33.380]  When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished.
[02:22:35.538 --> 02:22:39.860]  For the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the world government.
[02:22:40.601 --> 02:22:43.422]  Dr. Henry Kissinger, Bilderberg Conference, Evian, France, 1991.
[02:22:45.003 --> 02:22:46.724]  And they're doing nothing to stop any of this.
[02:22:46.784 --> 02:22:49.705]  In fact, engineering it, talking to John Moore.
[02:22:50.786 --> 02:22:59.550]  John, when we come back in the next segment, we're going to take some calls, but we have gotten up to the point now of just one example, one medication, one thing.
[02:23:00.567 --> 02:23:15.093]  And then once things do start breaking down, it really could cause a total breakdown of the society unless a large enough group of the population had prepared.
[02:23:15.133 --> 02:23:23.096]  I mean the government itself has bunkers and food supplies and weapons and all this, but then they discourage cities and counties and individuals doing it.
[02:23:23.116 --> 02:23:26.537]  It's almost like some kind of sign of being evil if you do.
[02:23:27.857 --> 02:23:28.698]  Absolutely, Alex.
[02:23:30.760 --> 02:23:36.503]  As you know from reading my bio, I've been around law enforcement and criminal matters for, this is my 32nd year.
[02:23:36.603 --> 02:23:38.344]  I'm still doing this for a living, by the way.
[02:23:39.785 --> 02:23:44.668]  You separate people addicted to nicotine, for example, from access to tobacco products.
[02:23:46.168 --> 02:23:51.751]  People addicted to nicotine will do almost anything to gain access to tobacco products.
[02:23:52.612 --> 02:23:58.355]  People addicted to alcohol will do almost anything they need to do to gain access to alcoholic products.
[02:23:59.295 --> 02:24:13.780]  We have a large percentage of people in this country with prescription psychoactive drugs of one form or another who would be cut off from that supply, which gives them the ability to live a somewhat normal life.
[02:24:13.800 --> 02:24:14.380]  25 million people.
[02:24:15.020 --> 02:24:15.861]  That's a lot of adults.
[02:24:17.021 --> 02:24:21.703]  A lot of adults going wacko because they don't have access to their prescription medications.
[02:24:21.883 --> 02:24:24.944]  And again, the drugs themselves are bad enough, folks, but it's proven.
[02:24:24.964 --> 02:24:28.185]  You go off these instantly, you go completely insane.
[02:24:28.465 --> 02:24:28.785]  Oh, yeah.
[02:24:29.438 --> 02:24:29.738]  Oh, yeah.
[02:24:29.958 --> 02:24:30.479]  Absolutely.
[02:24:31.259 --> 02:24:32.540]  And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[02:24:33.421 --> 02:24:39.745]  The real threat, as I mentioned in that little story about the Synthroid, is having the infrastructure break down.
[02:24:39.805 --> 02:24:42.767]  And it's a very delicate infrastructure.
[02:24:42.827 --> 02:24:44.568]  We have just-in-time delivery.
[02:24:44.608 --> 02:24:48.551]  We have overnight capabilities from Maine to California.
[02:24:48.571 --> 02:24:50.512]  And that's been done as a cost-cutter.
[02:24:51.393 --> 02:24:51.933]  Absolutely.
[02:24:52.578 --> 02:24:58.204]  On one hand, it's the most efficient and wonderful system of delivering products that's ever existed.
[02:24:58.325 --> 02:25:01.949]  On the other, it is very, very vulnerable to disruption.
[02:25:04.551 --> 02:25:10.378]  So imagine, folks, two or three weeks into this, there's not going to be food.
[02:25:12.674 --> 02:25:14.075]  Food is the way they will control.
[02:25:14.095 --> 02:25:15.795]  That's what has been demonstrated.
[02:25:15.835 --> 02:25:22.558]  Bosnia is probably the best working example of how they're going to go about the business of exercising control.
[02:25:22.658 --> 02:25:26.119]  I've even seen documents where they say it's a big war game, basically.
[02:25:26.319 --> 02:25:26.599]  It is.
[02:25:28.100 --> 02:25:30.021]  And they will make a game of it.
[02:25:30.081 --> 02:25:32.601]  If you want food, tell us who has guns.
[02:25:33.282 --> 02:25:37.063]  If you want more food, tell us who has other guns.
[02:25:37.143 --> 02:25:38.804]  That's the way the game is going to be played.
[02:25:39.884 --> 02:25:41.825]  They will use food as a method of control.
[02:25:42.751 --> 02:25:52.416]  Well, the UN head over the food program and population program in 1997 said in China, she said, we will use food as a weapon and we don't apologize about that.
[02:25:53.217 --> 02:25:56.098]  And also this obsession with the children.
[02:25:56.138 --> 02:26:06.104]  We knew about this years before, but then last year, Gannett News Service, Washington Post came out and said, yeah, during an attack, we're going to take all your children from the schools and make you come get them at another location.
[02:26:06.944 --> 02:26:09.886]  And under a red alert, basically, all your rights are stripped.
[02:26:10.798 --> 02:26:14.541]  Well, they certainly have the capability of doing that on a limited basis.
[02:26:14.561 --> 02:26:18.704]  To do it nationwide would be quite difficult, but certainly they have the ability to do that on a limited basis.
[02:26:18.724 --> 02:26:20.846]  Why are they training for it, then?
[02:26:34.716 --> 02:26:38.899]  Well, they'll be doing it on a selective, limited basis as they feel the need to, Alex.
[02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:42.161]  They certainly have the wherewithal to do that.
[02:26:42.201 --> 02:26:49.486]  They can't do it everywhere at the same time, and I think there are a lot of patriotic sheriffs at the county level who would resist that.
[02:26:51.608 --> 02:26:58.773]  But the sheriffs who are appointed, which is happening more and more, appointed sheriffs instead of elected sheriffs, they're a lot more likely to do what they're told.
[02:26:58.793 --> 02:27:00.014]  Yeah, you've got to love this.
[02:27:00.074 --> 02:27:01.715]  The sheriff is the elected official.
[02:27:01.775 --> 02:27:04.377]  That's the original body, and then the cities take that over.
[02:27:06.127 --> 02:27:06.347]  Right.
[02:27:06.447 --> 02:27:07.627]  Well, it's happening.
[02:27:07.647 --> 02:27:19.290]  They promote this in the name of efficiency and saving money to have appointed sheriffs instead of elected sheriffs, but you give up a lot when you have an appointed sheriff.
[02:27:20.670 --> 02:27:21.210]  Unbelievable.
[02:27:21.250 --> 02:27:25.111]  We'll talk more about how to prepare for this when we get back with John Moore.
[02:27:25.131 --> 02:27:28.952]  We'll also tell you about his new book and a lot more, so stay with us.
[02:27:35.939 --> 02:27:36.841]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.341 --> 02:27:38.944]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.865 --> 02:27:42.529]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.471 --> 02:27:47.952]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[02:27:48.152 --> 02:27:55.498]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[02:27:55.818 --> 02:28:00.221]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:28:00.501 --> 02:28:10.329]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[02:28:10.709 --> 02:28:11.650]  We're good to go.
[02:28:28.985 --> 02:28:31.309]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's food supply updates.
[02:28:31.329 --> 02:28:32.010]  It's powerful stuff.
[02:28:46.005 --> 02:28:50.946]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration bottle.
[02:28:51.266 --> 02:28:53.507]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating.
[02:28:53.567 --> 02:28:56.707]  Or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:28:56.747 --> 02:29:01.028]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[02:29:01.368 --> 02:29:04.389]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:29:04.709 --> 02:29:08.130]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[02:29:08.470 --> 02:29:17.816]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:29:18.076 --> 02:29:21.578]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:29:21.819 --> 02:29:28.763]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[02:29:46.052 --> 02:29:50.676]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glass, who is a pharmacist from Marks Basel Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[02:29:50.796 --> 02:29:52.017]  Hi, Alan, welcome to the program.
[02:29:52.197 --> 02:29:52.778]  Thank you, Marvin.
[02:29:52.958 --> 02:29:56.321]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[02:29:56.481 --> 02:29:57.021]  Is that true?
[02:29:57.242 --> 02:29:58.242]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[02:29:58.262 --> 02:30:01.245]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[02:30:01.285 --> 02:30:01.545]  price.
[02:30:01.765 --> 02:30:03.827]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[02:30:03.887 --> 02:30:04.608]  They're very common.
[02:30:04.708 --> 02:30:07.891]  Those common drugs you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[02:30:07.931 --> 02:30:08.151]  price.
[02:30:08.451 --> 02:30:09.612]  Now, what about Tamoxifen?
[02:30:09.652 --> 02:30:12.035]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[02:30:12.255 --> 02:30:16.059]  Tamoxifen, you can see a 75% savings against the regular U.S.
[02:30:16.099 --> 02:30:16.359]  price.
[02:30:16.739 --> 02:30:19.122]  Now, are these brand name products made by the same companies?
[02:30:19.382 --> 02:30:21.404]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[02:30:21.444 --> 02:30:23.466]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.
[02:30:23.726 --> 02:30:28.649]  So to save money on prescription drugs in Canada, call the toll-free number for your information package.
[02:30:28.909 --> 02:30:30.650]  To find out more, call toll-free 1-800-840-0686.
[02:30:30.670 --> 02:30:31.010]  That's 1-800-840-0686.
[02:30:31.090 --> 02:30:32.231]  Or go on the web at www.canshipdrugs.com.
[02:30:48.393 --> 02:30:54.415]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:55.036 --> 02:30:57.957]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:59.658 --> 02:31:02.479]  All right, we're talking to John Moore.
[02:31:02.499 --> 02:31:04.580]  We're going to go back to him here in just about two or three minutes.
[02:31:04.600 --> 02:31:09.542]  Then we're going to go to Anthony, Tim, Mike, Phil, Steve, and others.
[02:31:10.142 --> 02:31:12.463]  For our guests, John Moore, J.R.
[02:31:12.523 --> 02:31:12.823]  Moore.
[02:31:13.761 --> 02:31:15.942]  And the website's libertyman.com.
[02:31:15.962 --> 02:31:19.543]  We'll plug some of his great information here in just a few minutes.
[02:31:19.863 --> 02:31:23.584]  First off, Debbie Morrow, New Millennium Concepts, one of our big sponsors.
[02:31:24.344 --> 02:31:25.804]  It's where I buy my water filters.
[02:31:25.864 --> 02:31:27.165]  I bought them as gifts for others.
[02:31:27.185 --> 02:31:33.107]  A lot of the filters you buy at the store are knock-offs, or don't even clean the water up.
[02:31:33.147 --> 02:31:34.507]  They just take some of the bad taste out.
[02:31:34.607 --> 02:31:37.568]  This takes it out to non-detectable levels.
[02:31:37.588 --> 02:31:41.509]  That means electronic electron microscopes, they can't find anything.
[02:31:42.328 --> 02:31:46.730]  And they got them for $199, the big fancy ones for $259.
[02:31:46.770 --> 02:31:51.572]  You get two free gifts, survival DVDs or potassium iodide.
[02:31:51.952 --> 02:32:01.996]  They got the $20 sports bottles that'll do 600 and something refills of tap water, 130 refills of lake or creek or slime water to make it safe to drink.
[02:32:03.545 --> 02:32:07.007]  Just a great sponsor, and it's perfect to have her up while we're talking about this.
[02:32:07.027 --> 02:32:12.108]  Debbie, tell folks about some of the specials and the holiday special you got going.
[02:32:12.489 --> 02:32:13.189]  Hi there, Alex.
[02:32:13.269 --> 02:32:14.429]  Thanks for having me.
[02:32:14.489 --> 02:32:22.692]  Well, the holiday specials, we really want to encourage people to think about buying water filters for people for their holiday presents.
[02:32:22.752 --> 02:32:24.993]  In fact, I'm going to say the really bad word, Christmas.
[02:32:25.774 --> 02:32:31.596]  Or Hanukkah or whatever, you know, because you're going to go out and buy presents anyway.
[02:32:31.656 --> 02:32:34.197]  Why not give them the gift of good health and life?
[02:32:34.357 --> 02:32:42.481]  And, you know, our bodies are composed of more than 75% of water approximately, and you just never know what you're getting out there.
[02:32:42.541 --> 02:32:49.764]  But the Berkey water filters, you can filter your water and be assured that you're getting the best possible clean water.
[02:32:49.784 --> 02:32:55.306]  And the specials are really great because we want to encourage people
[02:32:56.215 --> 02:33:03.217]  If they buy one for themselves or buy multiple of them, instead of giving one free gift, we're going to double that.
[02:33:03.257 --> 02:33:08.539]  We're going to give two free gifts for each multiple that they buy.
[02:33:08.659 --> 02:33:10.920]  And I'll explain that to them when they call in.
[02:33:11.460 --> 02:33:18.343]  But it's great because not only can they give the water filter to someone, but let's say they buy two Berkey lights with lights.
[02:33:18.443 --> 02:33:20.423]  They're going to get five free sport bottles.
[02:33:20.964 --> 02:33:22.164]  Or they can mix and match.
[02:33:22.224 --> 02:33:23.364]  Give five of something.
[02:33:23.384 --> 02:33:25.125]  So not only do they have
[02:33:25.894 --> 02:33:27.715]  You know, a gift for themselves.
[02:33:28.015 --> 02:33:31.598]  And you have the Sheltering in Place DVD and VHS.
[02:33:31.738 --> 02:33:33.779]  Yeah, I really love that Sheltering in Place.
[02:33:33.899 --> 02:33:35.420]  It's so practical.
[02:33:35.520 --> 02:33:36.241]  It's by a U.S.
[02:33:36.261 --> 02:33:39.363]  government chemical biological radiological expert.
[02:33:39.383 --> 02:33:42.425]  It's really how to protect your house, not what Governor Ridge said.
[02:33:42.465 --> 02:33:43.566]  Here, have some duct tape.
[02:33:43.826 --> 02:33:47.528]  You've also got the prudent places, 500 full-color maps, all the statistics.
[02:33:48.009 --> 02:33:48.729]  Good thing to have.
[02:33:48.749 --> 02:33:51.491]  People can also buy all those individually if you want to call and get those.
[02:33:51.911 --> 02:33:53.813]  Give Debbie a call right now, folks.
[02:33:53.833 --> 02:33:53.853]  1-888.
[02:33:57.035 --> 02:33:57.136]  803-4438.
[02:33:57.236 --> 02:34:03.443]  Tell them it's the Alex Jones Holiday Special, because you won't get the same deal if you don't tell them that.
[02:34:03.463 --> 02:34:03.523]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:34:08.616 --> 02:34:10.917]  Or go to BerkeyWater.com.
[02:34:11.257 --> 02:34:17.141]  And by going to BerkeyWater.com, just in the comments section, tell them what free gift or gifts you want.
[02:34:17.161 --> 02:34:23.044]  So BerkeyWater.com or InfoWars.com is over there as well.
[02:34:23.164 --> 02:34:23.764]  Or 1-888-803-4438.
[02:34:24.084 --> 02:34:25.365]  Debbie, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:34:25.525 --> 02:34:26.365]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:34:26.445 --> 02:34:31.128]  And I wanted to mention on the website, you can print out our brochures if you want to read about it.
[02:34:31.736 --> 02:34:37.382]  There's a spot where you click on brochures, and you can print out the same literature that I mailed to people.
[02:34:37.422 --> 02:34:38.383]  Well, that's awesome.
[02:34:38.403 --> 02:34:39.544]  That way they can read that.
[02:34:39.865 --> 02:34:40.766]  That's awesome, Debbie.
[02:34:40.786 --> 02:34:42.027]  Thank you so much, and take care.
[02:34:42.047 --> 02:34:42.708]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:34:42.828 --> 02:34:43.008]  Bye.
[02:34:43.208 --> 02:34:49.955]  And when you give her a call, if there's only a couple people there answering the phone, if it's busy or it goes to voicemail, leave her name and number.
[02:34:49.975 --> 02:34:50.776]  She'll call you right back.
[02:34:51.954 --> 02:34:52.855]  Thanks a million, Debbie.
[02:34:53.356 --> 02:34:54.237]  Again, that's 888-803-4438.
[02:34:56.240 --> 02:34:58.002]  Going back to John Moore and then to your calls.
[02:34:58.843 --> 02:35:05.452]  John, speaking of getting prepared, you've got some materials available that are excellent for people.
[02:35:05.713 --> 02:35:06.514]  Tell folks about that.
[02:35:07.074 --> 02:35:07.334]  I do.
[02:35:07.374 --> 02:35:12.615]  At my website you'll find my book titled, Feel Safe Anywhere, You Can Be Your Own Bodyguard.
[02:35:13.175 --> 02:35:22.157]  It's a book directed towards families, people with children, business people while traveling, to be safe while traveling, while at home, and how to keep their kids safe.
[02:35:22.697 --> 02:35:29.519]  I spend a lot of time in the book talking about the mental preparedness and the combat mindset, which is very important.
[02:35:30.703 --> 02:35:39.229]  I also have a two-hour seminar in front of a live audience on videotape titled Family Safety in Perilous Times, Surviving Terrorist Attacks.
[02:35:39.870 --> 02:35:49.436]  Included with that is a two-page printed document that lists on one side common grocery store foods that will help build your immune system.
[02:35:49.857 --> 02:35:56.962]  The other side is a list of resources for books, training, and equipment that people would want to have access to.
[02:35:57.455 --> 02:36:01.597]  Now here's a little green beret trick for people that want to get Debbie's water filters.
[02:36:03.038 --> 02:36:03.478]  It will help.
[02:36:04.258 --> 02:36:08.961]  This involves filtering creek, pond or river water.
[02:36:10.101 --> 02:36:16.885]  You want to get a supply of paper coffee filters to pre-filter before you put it into your Berkey.
[02:36:17.845 --> 02:36:21.647]  This will extend the life tremendously by two or three times.
[02:36:21.687 --> 02:36:22.627]  In fact, they'll tell you that.
[02:36:22.647 --> 02:36:25.169]  You take a rubber band and a coffee filter and put it around it.
[02:36:25.369 --> 02:36:25.889]  Absolutely.
[02:36:26.734 --> 02:36:35.479]  That's a trick, and it does work, and it will get that big particulate out and extend the life of your Berkey considerably by taking that big stuff out first.
[02:36:36.899 --> 02:36:39.541]  Actually, I'm glad you mentioned that.
[02:36:39.701 --> 02:36:43.022]  Again, thelibertyman.com, have you got a phone number you want to give out?
[02:36:44.343 --> 02:36:45.564]  I think let's go over to the Internet.
[02:36:45.584 --> 02:36:52.467]  I do have a toll-free number at the Internet site, and I have a radio show every Saturday from 1 to 3 p.m.
[02:36:52.527 --> 02:36:53.708]  on Republic Broadcasting.
[02:36:54.701 --> 02:36:57.903]  And it's a lot of fun to be back on the air after being off for several years.
[02:36:57.923 --> 02:36:59.964]  I mean, you've done basically everything.
[02:37:00.424 --> 02:37:07.948]  And, of course, you were a bodyguard for executive stars and other Jane Fonda, Charlton Heston.
[02:37:08.569 --> 02:37:11.630]  Tell us the Jane Fonda story.
[02:37:12.731 --> 02:37:20.995]  When I was asked by these people to do this assignment, my first response was to turn it down, keeping in mind the Vietnam War was still going on.
[02:37:21.015 --> 02:37:21.515]  This was about 1973.
[02:37:23.950 --> 02:37:26.971]  And the people wanted me to set up the security detail.
[02:37:27.011 --> 02:37:29.372]  They said, well, John, look at it this way.
[02:37:29.392 --> 02:37:33.154]  If somebody tries to hurt her, they could hurt innocent people nearby.
[02:37:33.774 --> 02:37:35.395]  And I said, oh, yeah, you're right.
[02:37:35.475 --> 02:37:37.115]  So I went ahead and accepted the assignment.
[02:37:38.816 --> 02:37:49.220]  In hindsight, Jane Fonda was led astray by the communist she was hanging around with in France, including her, I don't know if he was her husband or boyfriend at the time.
[02:37:50.246 --> 02:37:55.808]  A young woman in her mid-twenties who, quite frankly, didn't know what the hell she was getting involved with.
[02:37:56.768 --> 02:38:01.309]  Anyway, she's since become a Christian, and I hope she's prayed to God for forgiveness.
[02:38:01.329 --> 02:38:02.330]  You know she's left the country.
[02:38:02.370 --> 02:38:05.211]  She only makes visits, she said, because she, quote, heard what was coming.
[02:38:05.251 --> 02:38:09.072]  That was three years ago, and she now lives down in Latin America.
[02:38:09.912 --> 02:38:10.692]  I don't know about that.
[02:38:10.712 --> 02:38:12.293]  She claims to be a born-again Christian.
[02:38:12.333 --> 02:38:16.154]  I hope she is, and I hope she's prayed for forgiveness for what she did during the Vietnam War.
[02:38:16.986 --> 02:38:20.232]  The Charlton Heston event was an NRA event in St.
[02:38:20.272 --> 02:38:20.553]  Louis.
[02:38:20.573 --> 02:38:23.739]  We had a good day and a good detail.
[02:38:24.059 --> 02:38:26.223]  Also, it's not in my bio, but I was...
[02:38:27.376 --> 02:38:37.144]  I had a security detail for former Ambassador Alan Keyes recently, and that was a fun time to be with Ambassador Keyes while he was in St.
[02:38:37.184 --> 02:38:37.424]  Louis.
[02:38:37.444 --> 02:38:39.486]  Yeah, he's a lot better than most of these politicians.
[02:38:40.086 --> 02:38:41.047]  Let's go to some calls.
[02:38:41.107 --> 02:38:44.770]  Let's talk to, up first here, Anthony in Louisiana.
[02:38:44.830 --> 02:38:45.510]  Anthony, go ahead.
[02:38:45.611 --> 02:38:46.211]  Thanks for holding.
[02:38:46.892 --> 02:38:47.152]  Hi.
[02:38:47.352 --> 02:38:53.537]  I have a question about the Oklahoma City bombing, and that is I don't understand how
[02:38:55.177 --> 02:39:03.442]  All these people were complicit in it, but yet Nichols and McVeigh never raised a word with their lawyers about these people, these other people.
[02:39:03.462 --> 02:39:16.489]  I mean, I don't have to be... Well, Nichols said he didn't do it, and McVeigh, I mean, was found by state police drooling, saying, I've got a chip, I've got a chip, with a gun, drooling on the side of the road.
[02:39:17.629 --> 02:39:20.431]  And then his doctor was Jolly and West.
[02:39:20.471 --> 02:39:22.152]  He admitted him, K-Ultra doctor.
[02:39:22.852 --> 02:39:24.514]  I've made two films about it.
[02:39:24.534 --> 02:39:26.075]  We've had 50 guests on about it.
[02:39:26.676 --> 02:39:31.380]  I mean, just bottom line, the official story of Oklahoma City is a complete fraud.
[02:39:31.400 --> 02:39:33.241]  Do you have any comments on that, Mr. Moore?
[02:39:33.602 --> 02:39:36.624]  For the sake of brevity, ditto, ditto, ditto.
[02:39:39.066 --> 02:39:41.167]  I mean, the building is blown out.
[02:39:41.228 --> 02:39:43.989]  We have video of them removing the bombs.
[02:39:44.009 --> 02:39:45.010]  It goes on and on.
[02:39:45.090 --> 02:39:46.771]  The feds won't release the videotapes.
[02:39:46.791 --> 02:39:48.132]  We've talked to the feds who saw them.
[02:39:48.412 --> 02:39:50.093]  It shows McVeigh with Iraqis.
[02:39:50.433 --> 02:39:51.694]  Then who are those Iraqis?
[02:39:51.734 --> 02:39:57.157]  They lead back the Republican Guard, trained here in the 80s when we were allies with Saddam, brought back in by Bush Jr.
[02:39:57.397 --> 02:39:58.698]  and another wave by Clinton.
[02:39:59.098 --> 02:40:00.919]  They thought they were part of some type of terror drill.
[02:40:02.300 --> 02:40:03.881]  At the same time, you have...
[02:40:04.321 --> 02:40:13.605]  The BATF showing up a minute and a half after the blast in full bomb gear that takes 20 minutes to put on, telling local police and firemen who we have in the film that we were told not to go to work that day.
[02:40:13.625 --> 02:40:15.566]  He goes on and on and on.
[02:40:15.626 --> 02:40:16.726]  Does that answer your question?
[02:40:16.786 --> 02:40:21.168]  It's a bottomless pit of deception and fraud and corruption.
[02:40:21.868 --> 02:40:29.571]  I mean, but if you were their legal counsel, even if they wanted to or not, wouldn't you try to subpoena some of these agents?
[02:40:29.831 --> 02:40:31.312]  Well, do you know who their legal counsel was?
[02:40:32.129 --> 02:40:35.131]  I guess they're a city appointed, or I mean... Stephen Jones.
[02:40:35.872 --> 02:40:40.575]  And that's a whole other story about Stephen Jones and the $17 million he got.
[02:40:41.355 --> 02:40:41.776]  Ah, okay.
[02:40:42.016 --> 02:40:42.456]  All right, thanks.
[02:40:42.856 --> 02:40:44.358]  Yeah, thank you for the call.
[02:40:44.978 --> 02:40:46.359]  Tim in Ohio, you're on the air.
[02:40:46.419 --> 02:40:46.819]  Go ahead.
[02:40:47.460 --> 02:40:48.080]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:48.761]  Hello.
[02:40:48.921 --> 02:40:49.461]  Hello, Mr. Moore.
[02:40:49.481 --> 02:40:50.522]  Tim, good afternoon.
[02:40:51.302 --> 02:40:55.725]  I was wanting to ask on a couple of other patriots I don't think we mentioned this afternoon.
[02:40:56.166 --> 02:40:58.107]  Cybo Edmonds and Colleen Rowley.
[02:40:58.867 --> 02:41:00.989]  What's the latest on those two, and are they okay?
[02:41:02.668 --> 02:41:03.550]  I don't know, Colleen.
[02:41:03.650 --> 02:41:11.082]  Personally, I know Special Agent Robert Wright, who went public in the fall of, disregard that, in the spring of 2002.
[02:41:11.183 --> 02:41:16.552]  They turned him with the W199I, right, with the rest, if you talk about what he knew?
[02:41:17.344 --> 02:41:19.585]  Yeah, I got him on tape off C-SPAN holding up the letter.
[02:41:19.605 --> 02:41:21.626]  He's been threatened with arrest if he tells you what he knows.
[02:41:21.646 --> 02:41:24.367]  Rowley is a shill.
[02:41:24.908 --> 02:41:29.590]  She comes out with limited information, and then ooh, she's the big whistleblower.
[02:41:29.610 --> 02:41:30.530]  They give her attention.
[02:41:30.550 --> 02:41:32.291]  I don't know what you call that tactic more.
[02:41:33.912 --> 02:41:38.434]  I read the complete, it was either 10 or 12 page memorandum she wrote to the director of the FBI.
[02:41:38.454 --> 02:41:39.995]  Yeah, I've seen that too.
[02:41:40.996 --> 02:41:45.778]  If you want to wreck your FBI career, just sign your name to a document like that.
[02:41:46.805 --> 02:41:49.087]  You know, that is not career enhancing.
[02:41:50.287 --> 02:41:57.551]  The chance of promotion or going anyplace in the FBI ended the moment she put her signature on that document.
[02:41:57.571 --> 02:42:02.634]  What I'm saying is the info she brought out is 1-100 as hardcore as Wright and others.
[02:42:03.275 --> 02:42:04.796]  It's a tiny percentage.
[02:42:05.676 --> 02:42:07.757]  It's part of a bigger puzzle, absolutely.
[02:42:07.817 --> 02:42:10.679]  So the media focused on what she had to say instead of all the others.
[02:42:12.749 --> 02:42:17.032]  Focusing on Colleen is a distraction from a lot of really good stuff, that's true.
[02:42:17.493 --> 02:42:20.115]  So we should pay more attention to Mr. Wright than Colleen Rowley.
[02:42:20.235 --> 02:42:24.118]  And the other agents in Arizona and Dallas and Minnesota.
[02:42:24.558 --> 02:42:29.943]  I met with Special Agent Wright in Chicago in the offices of Bill Shippers six weeks before 9-11.
[02:42:30.103 --> 02:42:32.025]  Oh, I loved it.
[02:42:32.085 --> 02:42:34.387]  You know, Shippers was all over trying to stop it.
[02:42:34.427 --> 02:42:37.870]  He was on the show two weeks after 9-11, but he was on before that.
[02:42:38.610 --> 02:42:39.331]  What were you there for?
[02:42:40.131 --> 02:42:47.398]  I was there for a meeting with the man in charge of Judicial Watch at the time, Larry Klayman.
[02:42:47.418 --> 02:42:53.023]  I was called into the conference room because I was about to accept an assignment to take over the new St.
[02:42:53.103 --> 02:42:54.485]  Louis office for Judicial Watch.
[02:42:55.446 --> 02:42:56.887]  I was there for the whole conference.
[02:42:58.949 --> 02:43:02.492]  I signed two Department of Justice non-disclosed agreements at that time.
[02:43:06.095 --> 02:43:10.876]  When shippers and Wright went public eight months later, I was released from all that.
[02:43:11.836 --> 02:43:22.899]  But the whole topic of the discussion was trying to get arrest warrants issued against Hamas terrorists inside this country because Wright couldn't figure out how to do it.
[02:43:23.799 --> 02:43:28.900]  He went through the chain of command and could not get arrest warrants issued against known terrorists.
[02:43:28.980 --> 02:43:31.421]  Well, that's because W1999 was blocking it.
[02:43:33.644 --> 02:43:36.145]  He was blocked by people inside the Department of Justice.
[02:43:36.586 --> 02:43:39.727]  And by the way, those individuals got cash bonuses and got promoted.
[02:43:40.188 --> 02:43:40.788]  Well, absolutely.
[02:43:41.368 --> 02:43:44.950]  One more quick question, if I may, if we could go back to the Vietnam discussion for a second.
[02:43:45.511 --> 02:43:49.453]  Was Colin Powell involved in the cover-up?
[02:43:49.513 --> 02:43:54.495]  And that's just because I can see right now, one by one in the administration, the foxes are leaving the hen house.
[02:43:55.136 --> 02:43:57.657]  Was he involved in the cover-up at the massacre at Malai?
[02:43:58.638 --> 02:43:59.998]  I don't have any information on that.
[02:44:00.018 --> 02:44:00.539]  Do you, Alex?
[02:44:01.099 --> 02:44:02.760]  No, and let me just tell you this.
[02:44:03.872 --> 02:44:04.232]  Okay.
[02:44:04.973 --> 02:44:07.315]  People think rats are leaving the ship.
[02:44:08.176 --> 02:44:09.537]  Really, they're just going to cash in.
[02:44:09.557 --> 02:44:10.598]  They always do this.
[02:44:10.918 --> 02:44:16.403]  And they're just removing lightning rods of criticism to put in new villains we'll have to learn the names of.
[02:44:16.763 --> 02:44:18.424]  Who will probably even be worse than the original.
[02:44:18.444 --> 02:44:20.686]  Well, like Alberto, I love Torture Gonzales, yeah.
[02:44:22.207 --> 02:44:23.348]  Thanks for the call, Tim.
[02:44:23.889 --> 02:44:25.250]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air.
[02:44:25.290 --> 02:44:25.690]  Go ahead.
[02:44:27.672 --> 02:44:28.272]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[02:44:28.573 --> 02:44:28.793]  Hello.
[02:44:29.681 --> 02:44:30.142]  Mr. Moore?
[02:44:30.562 --> 02:44:30.902]  Hello.
[02:44:31.603 --> 02:44:35.646]  In response to your previous caller, yeah, Paul was involved with My Lai.
[02:44:35.686 --> 02:44:39.930]  He was the major investigating that case.
[02:44:40.430 --> 02:44:41.411]  Yeah, I struck a bell.
[02:44:41.451 --> 02:44:43.212]  I just didn't have the specifics I didn't comment on.
[02:44:43.252 --> 02:44:48.397]  Yeah, and he basically took the commanding officer's word for it and just kind of swept it under the rug.
[02:44:48.437 --> 02:44:50.378]  And then, of course, the truth came out.
[02:44:50.438 --> 02:44:56.543]  And any other, you know, anyone but a kept officer like Paul would have been hanged over that.
[02:44:56.603 --> 02:44:58.745]  But he went on to bigger and better things, of course.
[02:44:59.685 --> 02:45:11.678]  Mr. Moore, I wanted to ask you, if or when this event occurs, this horrible event we've been talking about, the government is bound to say, well, they shielded this device, there's no way we could detect it.
[02:45:12.239 --> 02:45:13.601]  Will that be believable?
[02:45:14.201 --> 02:45:14.982]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:45:15.603 --> 02:45:17.906]  With enough lead shielding, you have to be...
[02:45:19.170 --> 02:45:22.411]  Within just a few feet to be able to find one of these things.
[02:45:22.731 --> 02:45:41.679]  Let me add something here, because I've read what the radiological experts have said, and just with the declassified type readers they have in helicopters and things, it supposedly takes massive amounts of lead shielding, and then they supposedly have classified new satellite-based systems that use a different type of reader that can look through hundreds of feet of stone.
[02:45:42.399 --> 02:45:48.821]  I mean, so talking about the level of lead shielding you need, wouldn't that thus not make it a suitcase nuke?
[02:45:48.861 --> 02:45:50.241]  I mean, you're talking about something even larger.
[02:45:51.321 --> 02:46:02.984]  Possibly, but suitcase nukes would be the weapon of choice because any nuclear device going off would cause massive problems, and they're a lot easier to conceal from detectives.
[02:46:03.024 --> 02:46:04.565]  How much lead shielding would that take?
[02:46:05.765 --> 02:46:09.146]  I don't know I'm qualified to comment on that, Alex, but it can be done.
[02:46:09.166 --> 02:46:09.866]  That's the bottom line.
[02:46:11.853 --> 02:46:18.337]  What I've gotten from good sources is they've got new devices, and by new I mean decades old, but they're classified that they can see every bit of this.
[02:46:19.297 --> 02:46:21.458]  That's certainly possible.
[02:46:21.678 --> 02:46:27.581]  And if these things aren't detected and they have the capability of doing so, that certainly points to government complicity, doesn't it?
[02:46:28.382 --> 02:46:28.482]  Yeah.
[02:46:29.398 --> 02:46:30.218]  Anything else, Mike?
[02:46:30.558 --> 02:46:30.879]  No, sir.
[02:46:30.919 --> 02:46:31.459]  Thank you very much.
[02:46:31.719 --> 02:46:32.599]  Appreciate the call.
[02:46:32.799 --> 02:46:34.360]  Phil in Oregon.
[02:46:34.440 --> 02:46:35.140]  Phil, you're on the air.
[02:46:35.160 --> 02:46:35.780]  Thanks for holding.
[02:46:36.040 --> 02:46:36.560]  Hey, Alex.
[02:46:36.580 --> 02:46:37.721]  Just an Arnold update.
[02:46:37.801 --> 02:46:47.944]  Last night on KOBI-TV out of Medford, they had a phone-in poll on whether we should amend the Constitution for foreign-born to run for president.
[02:46:48.284 --> 02:46:52.585]  The result was a stunning 93% rejection.
[02:46:53.085 --> 02:46:54.866]  You are penetrating the West.
[02:46:55.808 --> 02:46:58.452]  Well, I think it sounds like a radio broadcast.
[02:46:58.472 --> 02:46:59.193]  You've got a great voice.
[02:46:59.654 --> 02:47:05.122]  It sounds like KOBI just ran a real poll, and I think it's People's Common Sense.
[02:47:05.523 --> 02:47:06.544]  That's in Medford, Oregon?
[02:47:06.685 --> 02:47:06.785]  Yes.
[02:47:07.757 --> 02:47:08.857]  Did you find that online?
[02:47:08.877 --> 02:47:09.838]  Can you email that to me?
[02:47:10.078 --> 02:47:13.779]  Well, you know, I don't know if it's online, Alex, but it was on the tube last night.
[02:47:13.819 --> 02:47:21.582]  I also want to tell you that you did an interview a couple of Fridays ago at the original Rush Limbaugh station, KFBK in Sacramento.
[02:47:21.862 --> 02:47:22.142]  Yes.
[02:47:22.222 --> 02:47:32.326]  The nighttime neocon host, Mark Williams, made disparaging comments about you, but he played, he replayed your entire interview in the evening for the rest of us to hear.
[02:47:32.346 --> 02:47:33.366]  And I mean...
[02:47:34.449 --> 02:47:35.910]  Disparaging comments.
[02:47:35.970 --> 02:47:38.572]  What's your comment for Mr. Moore on this?
[02:47:39.393 --> 02:47:44.737]  The elite, former President Bush, pushed for Arnold to don't bet against him, and it was going to happen two days ago.
[02:47:44.757 --> 02:47:47.018]  They really are trying to set this guy up.
[02:47:47.058 --> 02:47:47.879]  Why do you think that is?
[02:47:48.819 --> 02:47:56.865]  Arnold might just be a distraction in order to have some other foreign national become president, like Mikhail Gorbachev, perhaps, or some other person.
[02:47:59.087 --> 02:48:00.368]  Yeah, or George Soros.
[02:48:00.728 --> 02:48:01.449]  Anything else?
[02:48:01.489 --> 02:48:03.250]  What kind of stuff was this talk show host saying?
[02:48:03.963 --> 02:48:07.085]  Oh, he was just saying that he is not a Nazi.
[02:48:07.105 --> 02:48:09.387]  He repeatedly said that he is not a Nazi.
[02:48:10.167 --> 02:48:14.930]  But nevertheless, Alex, he replayed your entire interview, so he must have some conscience.
[02:48:15.891 --> 02:48:20.074]  Well, that's good, but Arnold campaigns for Nazis after it's exposed that they are Nazis.
[02:48:20.574 --> 02:48:21.535]  You're doing a great job.
[02:48:22.015 --> 02:48:24.737]  And we have him hailing Hitler, a photo of him on the website.
[02:48:24.757 --> 02:48:25.757]  Well, what does that mean?
[02:48:28.319 --> 02:48:32.562]  I mean, yeah, he might not have been a 1944 National Socialist because he wasn't alive then.
[02:48:34.136 --> 02:48:34.957]  Thank you for the call.
[02:48:34.977 --> 02:48:38.762]  We'll come back and talk to Steve in Ohio and a few others with our guests.
[02:48:39.523 --> 02:48:41.225]  Mr. Moore, who we'll have to have back on soon.
[02:48:45.586 --> 02:48:47.087]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.287 --> 02:48:50.369]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.509 --> 02:48:54.411]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.451 --> 02:48:58.673]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:48:59.034 --> 02:49:02.796]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:02.896 --> 02:49:04.737]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:04.957 --> 02:49:08.259]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[02:49:08.279 --> 02:49:12.982]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.162 --> 02:49:16.203]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.384 --> 02:49:19.245]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:19.725 --> 02:49:25.849]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.369 --> 02:49:28.230]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[02:49:46.485 --> 02:49:57.749]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[02:49:57.969 --> 02:50:01.450]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[02:50:01.630 --> 02:50:02.050]  We're good to go.
[02:50:22.862 --> 02:50:29.787]  The Berkey light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[02:50:30.007 --> 02:50:35.931]  Get the Berkey light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:50:41.995 --> 02:50:43.276]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[02:51:48.562 --> 02:51:50.963]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central.
[02:51:50.983 --> 02:51:53.584]  That's 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[02:51:53.664 --> 02:51:54.064]  Eastern.
[02:51:54.184 --> 02:51:59.747]  We're here live back from 9 to midnight Central on the Global Shortwave during the day at 9.985.

[02:52:06.410 --> 02:52:11.812]  Before we go back to Mr. Moore and take a final call or two, I've made 11 films.
[02:52:12.812 --> 02:52:15.093]  I'm offering some of them as low as $5.95 apiece.
[02:52:17.870 --> 02:52:18.610]  Like my new film.
[02:52:19.211 --> 02:52:22.533]  You buy one copy, regular price, $19.95, of American Dictators.
[02:52:24.174 --> 02:52:26.155]  Five minutes short of being two hours long.
[02:52:27.516 --> 02:52:30.478]  You get each additional copy for $5.95, so you can give them as gifts.
[02:52:31.158 --> 02:52:32.659]  Or just make copies of the one you buy.
[02:52:34.360 --> 02:52:35.981]  Just get them out to people.
[02:52:36.001 --> 02:52:39.243]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, the preeminent 9-11 film out there, many have said.
[02:52:40.664 --> 02:52:43.145]  $24.95 for one copy, almost three hours long.
[02:52:43.706 --> 02:52:45.066]  Each additional copy, $5.95 with that order.
[02:52:46.767 --> 02:52:47.908]  Bunch of different specials.

[02:53:27.461 --> 02:53:28.202]  I'm pretty proud of it.
[02:53:28.829 --> 02:53:30.050]  A foreshadowing of what's coming.
[02:53:30.390 --> 02:53:33.653]  Steve in Ohio, you're one of our last callers on the air, with Mr. Moore.
[02:53:33.673 --> 02:53:34.013]  Go ahead.
[02:53:34.073 --> 02:53:35.674]  Yeah, how you doing, Alex?
[02:53:36.215 --> 02:53:37.015]  Real quick comment.
[02:53:37.275 --> 02:53:44.081]  I happened to tape the last broadcast of Tom Brokaw last night, and they were covering the Iraq War, and guess what?
[02:53:44.141 --> 02:53:53.808]  They are going to biometrically scan the people of Fallujah with eye scans, and they also made it clear that they were going to shoot to kill anybody that doesn't conform to the law.
[02:53:54.235 --> 02:53:55.676]  I mean, and they didn't say insurgent.
[02:53:55.696 --> 02:54:00.117]  They made it clear it was when they let the citizens back into the city to reclaim whatever's left.
[02:54:00.157 --> 02:54:01.118]  Wait a minute, you're joking.
[02:54:01.158 --> 02:54:07.200]  Dan Rather's, I mean, not Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw's last show, they said, we're going to rep the scan.
[02:54:07.260 --> 02:54:08.521]  I know they said that.
[02:54:08.581 --> 02:54:11.081]  I got the audio clip already queued up and it's ready to go.
[02:54:11.101 --> 02:54:11.602]  Do you want to hear it?
[02:54:11.702 --> 02:54:12.502]  I got to hear it.
[02:54:14.043 --> 02:54:14.743]  Here it is, folks.
[02:54:15.211 --> 02:54:17.732]  Many others are badly damaged.
[02:54:18.172 --> 02:54:25.075]  So far, the plan is for most of the city's 250,000 residents to return in stages.
[02:54:25.335 --> 02:54:27.516]  At first, only a few thousand will be let in.
[02:54:27.816 --> 02:54:39.121]  They'll be fingerprinted, given a retina scan, and then an ID card, which will only allow them to travel around their homes or to nearby aid centers, which are now being built.
[02:54:39.481 --> 02:54:44.063]  The Marines will be authorized to use deadly force against those breaking the rules.
[02:54:44.083 --> 02:54:44.143]  Tom?
[02:54:45.214 --> 02:54:46.815]  Richard, what's the latest on the election?
[02:54:46.835 --> 02:54:47.175]  Hear that?
[02:54:47.956 --> 02:54:48.816]  Now let me stop you.
[02:54:48.916 --> 02:54:51.818]  That is the most... That's what they've trained for here in America.
[02:54:51.838 --> 02:54:56.180]  I have video of them doing the mock retina scans, the cards, all that, and Police State 2000.
[02:54:56.220 --> 02:54:58.322]  That's what... I'm begging you.
[02:54:58.362 --> 02:55:00.103]  Will you mail that to me immediately?
[02:55:00.283 --> 02:55:00.923]  Yes, I will.
[02:55:00.983 --> 02:55:02.644]  I'll give you the video, the whole thing of it.
[02:55:02.684 --> 02:55:04.285]  But I was shocked when I saw it.
[02:55:04.625 --> 02:55:07.666]  They made it clear that they're going to retina scan the people.
[02:55:08.006 --> 02:55:10.947]  I cannot believe these poor people are like third world people.
[02:55:10.967 --> 02:55:12.568]  They're already putting them under this tyranny.
[02:55:12.588 --> 02:55:15.348]  Hey, listen, they're tearing out all their agriculture, everything.
[02:55:15.388 --> 02:55:16.629]  It's dehumanization.
[02:55:16.749 --> 02:55:19.010]  Yeah.
[02:55:19.090 --> 02:55:21.330]  Folks, that is the Antichrist beast system.
[02:55:21.490 --> 02:55:21.690]  Right.
[02:55:22.091 --> 02:55:26.112]  And then you've got your card, and if you walk to the wrong place, we're going to go ahead and shoot you.
[02:55:26.372 --> 02:55:29.393]  Mr. Moore, I mean, comments, final comments.
[02:55:30.211 --> 02:55:37.614]  Well, it doesn't surprise me, and this is a heads-up for what we're looking forward to in this country in the not-too-distant future.
[02:55:41.396 --> 02:55:43.576]  I'm almost speechless after that.
[02:55:44.077 --> 02:55:47.498]  Do you promise me that you're going to mail that to me?
[02:55:47.938 --> 02:55:49.039]  What do I send it to?
[02:55:49.059 --> 02:55:49.559]  Which address?
[02:55:50.459 --> 02:55:50.779]  Send it to 3001.
[02:55:50.819 --> 02:55:50.879]  Yes.
[02:55:53.257 --> 02:55:55.240]  South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R.
[02:55:55.520 --> 02:55:59.686]  I'll email you before I send it to let you know what I'm sending it, okay?
[02:55:59.786 --> 02:56:00.187]  Suite 100.
[02:56:00.287 --> 02:56:00.908]  Okay.
[02:56:01.348 --> 02:56:02.129]  Austin, Texas.
[02:56:02.230 --> 02:56:02.570]  Okay. 78704.
[02:56:05.416 --> 02:56:09.957]  And I tell you what, if you FedEx that bad boy to me, I'll send you three or four free videos.
[02:56:10.097 --> 02:56:11.477]  Okay, I will FedEx it to you.
[02:56:11.517 --> 02:56:13.678]  I'll give you a standard play copy.
[02:56:13.718 --> 02:56:15.038]  It's a high-quality copy.
[02:56:15.478 --> 02:56:17.459]  Yeah, and just thank you so much, sir.
[02:56:17.579 --> 02:56:18.079]  You're welcome.
[02:56:18.119 --> 02:56:18.359]  Bye-bye.
[02:56:18.959 --> 02:56:19.840]  Unbelievable.
[02:56:19.900 --> 02:56:20.820]  Did you hear that?
[02:56:21.400 --> 02:56:21.820]  I heard it.
[02:56:22.120 --> 02:56:23.740]  Can I get out my 800 number?
[02:56:23.760 --> 02:56:24.221]  Yes, fire it up.
[02:56:24.241 --> 02:56:24.281]  866-965-3007.
[02:56:24.301 --> 02:56:25.441]  Say it again.
[02:56:25.461 --> 02:56:25.741]  866-965-3007.
[02:56:26.261 --> 02:56:26.601]  Thank you.
[02:56:36.046 --> 02:56:36.262]  Go up!
