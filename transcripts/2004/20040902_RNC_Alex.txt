[00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.456]  Network, this is Erskine sitting in today at tomorrow for Alex Jones.
[00:00:05.183 --> 00:00:09.647]  Be sure and pick up a copy of Alex's videos.
[00:00:09.647 --> 00:00:30.765]  The PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com, The American Dictators, The Staged Election of 2004 is one of the videos available, and the person who did the video is with us right now, Alex Jones, direct from his interview that he got out on C-SPAN, as Sharon told us, at the very first hour.
[00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:32.467]  Alex, welcome to your own program.
[00:00:33.107 --> 00:00:33.627]  Yes, sir.
[00:00:33.627 --> 00:00:35.308]  Erskine, I'm sorry I called in late.
[00:00:35.308 --> 00:00:41.049]  I was here at Ground Zero despite the fact that the 9-11 Troop Troop has a permit to be here.
[00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:47.330]  I was just threatened with arrest and had to get myself out of that and had to basically threaten to sue them to have them leave me alone.
[00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.871]  And as I'm speaking, you've got the cameras rolling just to document everything in case they try something.
[00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:56.853]  I've almost been arrested three times every day anywhere in the city videotaping anything.
[00:00:56.853 --> 00:00:58.073]  It is an absolute nightmare.
[00:00:58.793 --> 00:01:00.954]  Uh, just, just so much has happened.
[00:01:00.954 --> 00:01:07.137]  And what I'll do is, I guess the last 20 minutes of the program, I'm going to call in and get everybody an update on what's happened in the last day.
[00:01:07.137 --> 00:01:11.959]  There is just so much here, but we're surrounded by police and they're coming in with plastic handcuffs.
[00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:16.881]  What they'll do is just encircle peaceful crowds with this orange netting and then round everybody up and arrest them.
[00:01:17.621 --> 00:01:22.907]  There's over 2,000 people that they put in a camp, Pier 57, an old condemned bus terminal.
[00:01:22.907 --> 00:01:24.148]  They parked the buses.
[00:01:24.148 --> 00:01:25.990]  It's a giant facility out over the Hudson River.
[00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.414]  It's being called Guantanamo on the Hudson.
[00:01:29.414 --> 00:01:32.257]  We were threatened with arrest there as well.
[00:01:32.897 --> 00:01:36.579]  We've had them grab cameras and smash them right in front of us.
[00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.622]  They were so stupid they didn't know our other camera was rolling getting this.
[00:01:40.622 --> 00:01:42.363]  This city is in total martial law.
[00:01:42.363 --> 00:01:47.065]  Surveillance blimps, helicopters everywhere, military on the streets, militarized police.
[00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:49.246]  It is just thoroughly disgusting.
[00:01:49.246 --> 00:01:51.728]  2,000 people in a condemned building that the bus company...
[00:01:52.308 --> 00:01:57.953]  That the bus company pulled people out of, uh, six years ago because the asbestos is hanging down.
[00:01:57.953 --> 00:02:02.757]  They have barbed wire inside, uh, in containment facilities with porta-potties outside.
[00:02:02.757 --> 00:02:04.238]  People have to beg to use the bathroom.
[00:02:04.238 --> 00:02:08.061]  2,000 people at any one time locked up in this giant pen.
[00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:09.282]  It has been total bedlam.
[00:02:09.282 --> 00:02:10.343]  It is so exciting, though.
[00:02:10.343 --> 00:02:15.167]  I have run into probably 500, 600 people now that are fans of the radio show and aware of the new world.
[00:02:15.627 --> 00:02:16.508]  We're good to go.
[00:02:38.744 --> 00:02:43.267]  Hundreds of the people that have been arrested are literally foreign tourists, old ladies, who are in wheelchairs.
[00:02:43.267 --> 00:02:49.652]  They will just block off a whole street in a, quote, authorized protest, come in with this orange netting, round everybody up.
[00:02:49.652 --> 00:02:53.435]  Now, they will ride horses into people, they will ride mopeds into people to cause crises.
[00:02:53.435 --> 00:02:56.057]  Many of the anarchists work for them and have been threatening us.
[00:02:56.057 --> 00:02:59.019]  There's just a few hundred anarchists that are used to create crises.
[00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.221]  The march on Sunday had over 300,000 people in it.
[00:03:02.221 --> 00:03:03.762]  There have been huge protests everywhere.
[00:03:03.762 --> 00:03:06.384]  The news is totally distorting all of this, Erskine.
[00:03:07.441 --> 00:03:18.710]  It's not on CNN, it's not on NBC, ABC, CBS, and the estimates of the crowd is anywhere from 250,000 to 500,000, but it is covered by the foreign press.
[00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.731]  We're not allowed to see it ourselves.
[00:03:20.731 --> 00:03:24.634]  Are we in New York City, Police State 2004?
[00:03:24.634 --> 00:03:26.115]  Is this a police state?
[00:03:26.115 --> 00:03:30.719]  Is this what you were talking about in Police State 1, 2, and 3?
[00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:32.280]  Is it here now in New York?
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.161]  It is.
[00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:34.402]  Everything is color of law.
[00:03:34.402 --> 00:03:36.004]  There's no logins filming.
[00:03:36.004 --> 00:03:39.829]  But anywhere you are on the street doing anything, they will treat you like dogs.
[00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.551]  They're on a total power trip.
[00:03:41.551 --> 00:03:43.994]  They are hyped up and just raging.
[00:03:43.994 --> 00:03:46.798]  And anybody that shows any fear automatically gets arrested.
[00:03:46.798 --> 00:03:49.761]  I've noticed you have to buck up and bull up and say, I got the first amendment.
[00:03:49.761 --> 00:03:50.943]  You do whatever you want, buddy.
[00:03:51.543 --> 00:03:58.888]  And, uh, right now they were getting the cuffs out about to arrest me here at a, uh, march that actually has a permit in front of Ground Zero.
[00:03:58.888 --> 00:03:59.988]  We're here talking about 9-11.
[00:03:59.988 --> 00:04:02.390]  We're here talking about who was behind 9-11.
[00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:09.934]  And I had them, you know, threaten to arrest me again, saying, saying that my press pass wasn't proper, as if I even need a press pass to be here.
[00:04:09.934 --> 00:04:12.296]  This is absolutely disgusting.
[00:04:12.296 --> 00:04:15.217]  And it sickens me to see America being turned into this.
[00:04:15.217 --> 00:04:19.220]  But it's only going to get worse and worse and worse because of what these scoundrels have done.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.142]  The globalists have come back to the scene of the crime, they have come back to the scene of what they did on 9-11, and we are going to continue to stand up against them.
[00:04:26.142 --> 00:04:31.883]  And last time I got live on C-SPAN, kind of guerrilla information warfare tactic, and got the truth out, Erskine.
[00:04:31.883 --> 00:04:33.864]  You've obviously already heard about that.
[00:04:33.864 --> 00:04:42.666]  We've heard about it, we're trying to get a video of it, and you've got 50% according to the Zogby Poll of the New Yorkers are aware that the
[00:04:43.422 --> 00:04:45.564]  9-11 was planned.
[00:04:45.564 --> 00:04:46.804]  They knew about it.
[00:04:46.804 --> 00:04:49.526]  50% according to the Zogby Poll.
[00:04:49.526 --> 00:04:52.909]  You are in an area where the people know and they understand.
[00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:55.170]  Is this getting out on local TV?
[00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.552]  At least you'll have to see in New York.
[00:04:57.552 --> 00:04:59.794]  Let me give folks the actual Zogby Poll.
[00:04:59.794 --> 00:05:00.534]  29% in New York City.
[00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:03.889]  I finally got a copy of it.
[00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.932]  49% in New York City believe it was government prior knowledge or involvement.
[00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:11.535]  In New York State itself, 41% believe that.
[00:05:11.535 --> 00:05:20.921]  And 68% want Eliot Spitzer to do an in-depth investigation and do not believe in the 9-11 whitewash commission appointed by George W. New World Order liberal Bush.
[00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:23.483]  We'll be right back with Alex Jones live.
[00:05:23.483 --> 00:05:30.588]  Report from New York and Harry Brown and Paul Joseph Watson who are also going to be talking with Alex right after these words.
[00:05:35.473 --> 00:05:38.516]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:05:38.516 --> 00:05:45.662]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:05:45.662 --> 00:05:50.866]  We all have busy lives and sometimes that causes us to miss out on the things that are most important to us.

[00:07:46.631 --> 00:07:47.812]  Spring has arrived.
[00:07:47.812 --> 00:07:50.993]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:07:50.993 --> 00:07:54.675]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:07:54.675 --> 00:08:02.778]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[00:09:09.329 --> 00:09:17.657]  This is the only place, this is the Alex Jones Program, where you're going to understand what's going on for real in New York and the poll results.
[00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:26.305]  May 26th, Toronto Star reported a national poll showed that 63, 63% of Canadians are convinced that U.S.
[00:09:26.305 --> 00:09:31.450]  leaders had prior knowledge of the attacks and yet declined to act.
[00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:32.391]  66% of New Yorkers
[00:09:32.991 --> 00:09:42.594]  According to the Zogby Poll just released August 30th, call for a new probe of unanswered questions by Congress or New York's Attorney General.
[00:09:42.594 --> 00:09:55.378]  You've got 49.3% of New York residents and 41% of the New York citizens overall say that some of our leaders knew in advance that attacks were planned on or around September 11, 2001.
[00:09:55.378 --> 00:09:56.638]  And they consciously failed to act.
[00:10:00.439 --> 00:10:01.941]  That is half.
[00:10:01.941 --> 00:10:04.966]  Half of the New York City residents.
[00:10:04.966 --> 00:10:06.728]  This is ground zero.
[00:10:06.728 --> 00:10:08.250]  Where it happened.
[00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:09.372]  New York City.
[00:10:09.372 --> 00:10:12.075]  They're not buying the government version.
[00:10:12.075 --> 00:10:17.243]  They know that it is order out of chaos, elite-sponsored terrorism, and New World Order.
[00:10:17.803 --> 00:10:21.765]  The report on what's going on right from ground zero.
[00:10:21.765 --> 00:10:28.788]  I want you to hear it again from Alex Jones, the man who's there who was almost arrested three times.
[00:10:28.788 --> 00:10:30.609]  Alex, give that report again.
[00:10:30.609 --> 00:10:31.650]  How bad is it?
[00:10:32.895 --> 00:10:34.816]  It's unspeakable, it's indescribable.
[00:10:34.816 --> 00:10:44.040]  Again, I'm here at Ground Zero, surrounded by survivors of 9-11, people who were here, people... I've talked to a bunch of people who were there, firefighters saying, get back.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.480]  We're about to bring down Building 7.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.561]  People even heard it on NPR that day.
[00:10:47.561 --> 00:10:50.002]  It's admitted that they blew up Building 7.
[00:10:50.002 --> 00:10:53.443]  The owner's even gone on television and said, we've made the decision to pull it.
[00:10:53.443 --> 00:10:55.164]  I'm right here by Silverstein Properties.
[00:10:55.164 --> 00:11:00.366]  I'm right here, just 50 feet from the bed, surrounded by police with their clubs out just staring at us.
[00:11:00.966 --> 00:11:01.926]  Uh, it's disgusting.
[00:11:01.926 --> 00:11:04.347]  Some of the boys you talked to are aware of what's happening.
[00:11:04.347 --> 00:11:06.588]  But as you said, they cannot hide this forever.
[00:11:06.588 --> 00:11:11.609]  The polls, you just read that big Canadian poll with 60 plus percent thinking it's a big cover-up.
[00:11:11.609 --> 00:11:13.870]  Most New Yorkers thinking it's a big cover-up.
[00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.870]  It is unbelievable, Erskine.
[00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.431]  And just to see this country going to hell in a handbasket is...
[00:11:18.831 --> 00:11:21.192]  It's very, very painful.
[00:11:21.192 --> 00:11:25.914]  Now, folks, here is a survivor, a lady who worked in the center.
[00:11:25.914 --> 00:11:34.378]  And ma'am, can you tell us your name and why you're out here handing out information, deception dollars and the 9-11 truth movement pamphlets to people?
[00:11:34.378 --> 00:11:42.142]  Can you tell the world just in a nutshell what most of your workers are thinking and some of the key things that you think are cover-ups involving 9-11?
[00:11:43.149 --> 00:11:46.392]  Well, at a minimum, that Seven World Trade, absolutely.
[00:11:46.392 --> 00:11:47.253]  What's your name?
[00:11:47.253 --> 00:11:48.855]  My name is Andrea Pistorius.
[00:11:48.855 --> 00:11:54.341]  I have worked and lived in New York for more than 20 years and happen to have been working in the downtown area, actually.
[00:11:54.341 --> 00:11:59.586]  I was working in the World Financial Center complex on the day of September 11th.
[00:11:59.586 --> 00:12:00.947]  I was in the building during the night before.
[00:12:00.947 --> 00:12:04.411]  I'm a member of a professional association on the 44th floor of One World Trade.
[00:12:04.887 --> 00:12:07.890]  I supervise an office in One World Trade back in the mid-eighties.
[00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:09.672]  Right now some of the key points you told me about earlier.
[00:12:09.672 --> 00:12:16.058]  Some of the key points are that there were explosives up through Six World Trade that I heard before Ida Tower came down.
[00:12:16.058 --> 00:12:24.427]  Seven World Trade we knew was not in bad condition and later on in the day on live radio where one of our local live reporters was downtown.
[00:12:24.987 --> 00:12:25.567]  We're good to go.
[00:12:44.998 --> 00:12:46.058]  Ma'am, I was talking to you.
[00:12:46.058 --> 00:12:46.999]  You live down here.
[00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:48.099]  You said you talked to the widows.
[00:12:48.099 --> 00:12:49.179]  You talked to the locals.
[00:12:49.179 --> 00:12:52.940]  Can you tell us about people who were discussing the explosives and the rest of it?
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.321]  And you said you talked to locals who were told to get back.
[00:12:55.321 --> 00:12:56.722]  They were about to bring down Building 7.
[00:12:56.722 --> 00:12:58.502]  Can you repeat that for the listeners?
[00:12:58.502 --> 00:13:00.183]  They had said... Tell us who you are.
[00:13:00.183 --> 00:13:11.666]  I'm Arlene Rubin, and they said over and over again that from the base of the building and from the mid-floors that explosives were bringing down the World Trade Center to run for your life.
[00:13:13.035 --> 00:13:13.615]  Unbelievable!
[00:13:13.615 --> 00:13:16.976]  They said explosives were bringing it down run for your life.
[00:13:16.976 --> 00:13:21.438]  Building 7 was blown when they said the words Larry Silverstein.
[00:13:21.438 --> 00:13:23.478]  They told him they're going to pull it.
[00:13:23.478 --> 00:13:28.340]  That means that the building has already been armed, wired with explosives.
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.841]  Prior wiring with explosives, Alex!
[00:13:32.026 --> 00:13:33.047]  It's incredible, Erskine.
[00:13:33.047 --> 00:13:35.288]  I know you've got Harry Brown and Paul Watson there.
[00:13:35.288 --> 00:13:36.388]  Why don't you bring those guys up?
[00:13:36.388 --> 00:13:37.749]  I don't want to monopolize it.
[00:13:37.749 --> 00:13:38.329]  Absolutely.
[00:13:38.329 --> 00:13:42.111]  Paul, Harry, anything you want to ask Alex right now at Ground Zero?
[00:13:42.111 --> 00:13:42.631]  Well, yeah.
[00:13:42.631 --> 00:13:45.072]  I mean, if I can jump in, I'd just ask Alex.
[00:13:45.072 --> 00:13:51.915]  I mean, we've had reports about police arresting medics so that, you know, the handcuffed and beaten protesters couldn't get treatment.
[00:13:51.915 --> 00:13:52.936]  All kinds of police brutality.
[00:13:52.936 --> 00:14:01.280]  We've got video, Paul, we've got video of them with giant orange construction fences rounding up peaceful
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.702]  Well, yes, and those articles have been in the New York Daily News.
[00:14:04.702 --> 00:14:05.622]  Also, we've had reports about
[00:14:29.321 --> 00:14:38.310]  Black Bloc anarchist provocateurs setting fire to trash cans and then when the people go up and ask them which group they're affiliated with they don't give a response though.
[00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.432]  Have you seen any kind of provocateur?
[00:14:40.432 --> 00:14:42.234]  Yes, we've been threatened by the communists.
[00:14:42.234 --> 00:14:43.695]  They said we wish Stalin would kill you.
[00:14:43.695 --> 00:14:46.538]  Most of the so-called anarchists are really communists.
[00:14:46.938 --> 00:14:48.599]  They seem to be working with the police.
[00:14:48.599 --> 00:14:49.740]  They're never arrested.
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.561]  They'll go burn something or punch somebody or throw something at a cop.
[00:14:52.561 --> 00:14:58.185]  Then they pull back, and a police captain will give an order, and they'll rush in with horses or mopeds and run over crowds.
[00:14:58.185 --> 00:15:01.367]  When people fight back, there's a riot, and they begin pell-mell.
[00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:02.687]  Yeah, there'll be 600, 800 armed, you know, ninja...
[00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:10.030]  Outfitted, armored, outfitted cops will run out of a parking garage who are just waiting.
[00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.051]  These are staged events.
[00:15:11.051 --> 00:15:16.272]  They will usher a crowd of a few thousand people, as others, dozens of small protests going on spontaneously everywhere.
[00:15:16.272 --> 00:15:20.573]  They will usher them down a few streets, tell them, go this way, go that way, come with us.
[00:15:20.573 --> 00:15:28.796]  Then they get people hoarded into a spot, then the anarchists do something, and then waiting cops come running out of parking garages or waiting buses to beat the living daylights out of them.
[00:15:31.124 --> 00:15:33.887]  This is nowhere on U.S.
[00:15:33.887 --> 00:15:34.247]  media.
[00:15:34.247 --> 00:15:36.089]  You're not seeing it anywhere.
[00:15:36.089 --> 00:15:37.951]  Comment on that, Alex.
[00:15:37.951 --> 00:15:41.755]  Well, I mean, basically, I'd like to hear from Harry Brown, but I mean, there is a total media blackout.
[00:15:41.755 --> 00:15:44.598]  They're distorting the news, whether it's on liberal or conservative media.
[00:15:44.598 --> 00:15:46.119]  It's globalist corporate media.
[00:15:46.119 --> 00:15:47.120]  It's not free market.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.421]  They're organized criminals.
[00:15:48.421 --> 00:15:49.763]  Does Mr. Brown have any comments?
[00:15:50.549 --> 00:15:53.773]  Well, obviously it's a terrible situation.
[00:15:53.773 --> 00:16:03.484]  I want to take a look on the web and see if CNN or NBC or any of these networks are putting it at least up on the internet.
[00:16:03.484 --> 00:16:09.831]  And, of course, I don't sit and watch network news all day long, so I have no idea what's going on on TV.
[00:16:10.792 --> 00:16:15.455]  Uh, does anybody else here, uh, has anybody else watched TV this morning?
[00:16:15.455 --> 00:16:35.988]  Well, at night when I get in at 2 AM after, you know, these 14, 15 hour days, I'll watch Fox, I'll watch CNN, and the first few days it's like, everything's great, we'll see in a report on the protest, but Fox is like, everything's great, everybody, people, New Yorkers love us, man, things are really going well, meanwhile I'm outside with hundreds of thousands of people going, ah, I didn't do well, I didn't do well, I didn't do well, I didn't do well!
[00:16:35.988 --> 00:16:38.170]  I mean, it's just a complete opposite
[00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:41.154]  Uh, of, uh, what the news is portraying.
[00:16:41.154 --> 00:16:46.321]  Now the New York media is reporting on a lot of this, but not on the provocateur nature of these anarchists.
[00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:51.013]  It is being reported in foreign news, Alex.
[00:16:51.013 --> 00:16:56.118]  It's being reported on German, it's being reported on BBC, it's being reported on Canadian.
[00:16:56.118 --> 00:17:00.222]  The foreign news services are covering the demonstrations.
[00:17:00.222 --> 00:17:04.706]  Well, I'll tell you what, I want you to talk to Kevin Booth, who's a cameraman and also working with me on this film.
[00:17:04.706 --> 00:17:06.308]  Kevin's over here running the camera.
[00:17:06.308 --> 00:17:09.410]  I'll tell you what, Ted, we can take over for Kevin.
[00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.994]  And then I want you to describe how they took our camera away and smashed it.
[00:17:13.274 --> 00:17:14.634]  Hey, how's it going?
[00:17:14.634 --> 00:17:15.114]  Hi, Kevin.
[00:17:15.114 --> 00:17:16.415]  What's going on over there?
[00:17:16.415 --> 00:17:17.475]  Uh, it's pretty crazy.
[00:17:17.475 --> 00:17:20.376]  I mean, uh, everywhere we're going, you know, there's a group gathering around Alex.
[00:17:20.376 --> 00:17:25.517]  And, uh, it's pretty crazy because the police really don't know what to make of him, you know.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.542]  You know, they keep coming up to him, but of course he doesn't back down at all.
[00:17:48.542 --> 00:17:55.125]  They're kind of just sort of staying out of arm's reach of Alex the whole time.
[00:17:55.125 --> 00:17:57.986]  But they're definitely keeping an eye on us the whole time.
[00:17:58.638 --> 00:18:06.760]  Last time we were here at the 9-11 site, uh, we were having some kind of government agent guy taking still photographs of our faces.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:07.601]  Right out of a movie.
[00:18:07.601 --> 00:18:15.583]  I mean, like a plant posed guy with the, um, like a tan vest on with the classic, you know, big zoom lens camera.
[00:18:15.583 --> 00:18:20.285]  And, uh, you know, just standing there taking close-up stills of all of our faces.
[00:18:20.285 --> 00:18:23.085]  And, uh, so I know I'm on the list with Alex now.
[00:18:23.085 --> 00:18:24.006]  Officially on the list.
[00:18:25.205 --> 00:18:26.406]  We've had some crazy moments.
[00:18:26.406 --> 00:18:27.967]  Tell them about the Ford.
[00:18:27.967 --> 00:18:29.828]  What about the Ford?
[00:18:29.828 --> 00:18:32.530]  Well, tell them about the jet boats chasing us.
[00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:33.450]  Yeah, we went out.
[00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:35.872]  A friend of ours has a really fast boat.
[00:18:35.872 --> 00:18:37.172]  He's a fan of Alex's.
[00:18:37.172 --> 00:18:39.734]  He has like a cigarette ocean racer.
[00:18:39.734 --> 00:18:42.456]  And he took us out at night to show us the Statue of Liberty.
[00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:45.538]  And we had the Homeland Security boats come up to us.
[00:18:45.538 --> 00:18:48.920]  They're just like out of the scene apocalypse now.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.402]  Where the boats come up and they do the search on you.
[00:18:53.055 --> 00:18:56.838]  And this is funny because the guy, you know, they kind of play a game of intimidation with him.
[00:18:56.838 --> 00:19:03.002]  But after we were okay with him, he just took off in one direction and the boats like gave chase to us.
[00:19:03.002 --> 00:19:07.025]  And this guy just kind of played the game and he just hit the throttle full blast.
[00:19:07.025 --> 00:19:10.608]  We watched the little flashing cherry lights disappear over the horizon.
[00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:12.570]  Show them the guns!
[00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:17.974]  Yeah, they had .50 caliber machine guns mounted on the front of these Homeland Security boats and Coast Guard boats.
[00:19:17.974 --> 00:19:22.377]  And then we had to take a subway back because we didn't get a taxi cab and we had a situation where
[00:19:23.001 --> 00:19:26.783]  We saw this really sad scene with this old lady.
[00:19:26.783 --> 00:19:28.084]  We all felt really sorry for her.
[00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:34.348]  She was terribly hunchbacked and sleeping in a subway station.
[00:19:34.348 --> 00:19:35.388]  We all felt really horrible.
[00:19:35.388 --> 00:19:47.055]  She was asleep, so John Stanton, our gate, got out of the subway for a second, I think for like a $5 or $10 bill, inside of her purse, and we videotaped us doing it, and the police jumped out and grabbed Alex's camera.
[00:19:47.987 --> 00:19:50.950]  And, uh, you know, they shut down the subway.
[00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:51.751]  They got us off.
[00:19:51.751 --> 00:19:55.454]  They were gonna, like, detain us at the station for a really long time.
[00:19:55.454 --> 00:19:57.977]  And then this other woman that was there with us took a picture of them.
[00:19:57.977 --> 00:20:01.180]  They ended up, like, tearing all the film out of her camera.
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:08.127]  And, uh, you know, even when we went to the convention last night, there's just one person after another, like, grabbing your pass and checking on you.
[00:20:09.065 --> 00:20:11.908]  It's like you're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't.
[00:20:11.908 --> 00:20:19.635]  If you have a short hair and you look like a Republican and have a Republican pass, then you've got one group of people screaming at you.
[00:20:19.635 --> 00:20:23.898]  If you look kind of liberal or you have long hair, then you've got the police surrounding you.
[00:20:23.898 --> 00:20:25.800]  No one the hell was in condition.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:32.226]  In Austin, where I live, if I see just a couple of cops here or there, I keep an eye out for them or just whatever.
[00:20:32.226 --> 00:20:33.187]  I don't break the law.
[00:20:33.187 --> 00:20:34.248]  But you're aware of them.
[00:20:36.044 --> 00:20:46.813]  But here, after just four or five days, I've noticed myself just walking past the fifty to a hundred police, and it's like you don't even know that they're there anymore.
[00:20:46.813 --> 00:20:52.118]  I was sitting like a... policeman at dinner the other night.
[00:20:52.118 --> 00:21:01.506]  They all had, like, big machine guns, and I'm sitting there talking about how I needed to buy a police scanner so I could keep up with it all, because I was, like, not even paying attention to them, so numb to the fact that they're all surrounding me.
[00:21:02.957 --> 00:21:09.400]  Kevin, has it become an us vs. them mentality?
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.462]  Yeah, definitely.
[00:21:11.462 --> 00:21:17.265]  Although, you know, the sad thing is a lot of the cops, probably as people, they're probably not bad people as people.
[00:21:17.265 --> 00:21:23.129]  Or even, you know, I spent a lot of time in Los Angeles and I think the LAPD, they have like a meaner mentality.
[00:21:23.129 --> 00:21:28.052]  And when you get these guys off separately by themselves, they all seem to be like nice people.
[00:21:28.052 --> 00:21:31.674]  But it's definitely like a group thing, for sure, all together.
[00:21:32.447 --> 00:21:37.009]  And when you're out there on the street, they just kind of have this invincible attitude.
[00:21:37.009 --> 00:21:39.590]  You know, when they get mad at you, they ratchet up.
[00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:46.152]  If they have a reason to come after you, you can be the most reasonable, normal person, and they'll just start screaming in your face.
[00:21:46.152 --> 00:21:48.133]  And it's completely unnecessary.
[00:21:48.133 --> 00:21:53.415]  You know, there's just situations where it's just a couple of police and us, and you know, we're walking around with a camera.
[00:21:53.415 --> 00:21:54.736]  We have, you know, photopaths.
[00:21:54.736 --> 00:21:56.356]  We're nicely dressed.
[00:21:56.356 --> 00:22:00.978]  And these guys are in your face, screaming at you, and you're just... What are you expecting tonight?
[00:22:02.515 --> 00:22:04.176]  Well, I have no idea.
[00:22:04.176 --> 00:22:08.480]  You know, the anarchists have been threatening, like, some big surprise for the last three days.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:13.444]  The police think that they're kind of, like, you know, they keep saying, oh, tonight at 7, and then it doesn't happen.
[00:22:13.444 --> 00:22:14.865]  Tomorrow at 3, and then it doesn't happen.
[00:22:14.865 --> 00:22:21.750]  So the police and everybody's kind of on edge waiting for the anarchists to pull some big surprise.
[00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.232]  So we have no idea.
[00:22:23.232 --> 00:22:24.433]  We have no idea if you go either way.
[00:22:24.433 --> 00:22:29.436]  I know they have a secret train underground ready to take George Bush off the island, you know, ASAP.
[00:22:30.778 --> 00:22:33.380]  Harry Paul, any questions?
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:36.061]  Yeah, I'll just jump in there and ask Kevin.
[00:22:36.061 --> 00:22:45.986]  We've had reports which were carried in the daily news about plain-clothed police officers randomly plowing mopeds into giant groups of people.
[00:22:45.986 --> 00:22:48.888]  Have you seen any examples of that take place?
[00:22:48.888 --> 00:22:54.351]  I just, all I saw was on the news and just probably the same story you've seen, you know.
[00:22:54.351 --> 00:22:59.934]  And, you know, basically, anyways, I gotta, here's Alex, it was great talking to you guys.
[00:23:01.278 --> 00:23:02.058]  Alright, thanks a lot guys.
[00:23:02.058 --> 00:23:03.519]  We've got to reload our camera.
[00:23:03.519 --> 00:23:04.659]  It's dangerous to not have it reloaded.
[00:23:04.659 --> 00:23:05.779]  We just ran out of tape.
[00:23:05.779 --> 00:23:07.080]  Erskine, I don't want to monopolize here.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:12.161]  Do you want me to let you go and let Harry and Paul and you continue?
[00:23:12.161 --> 00:23:18.303]  There isn't any monopoly because this is a report that no one is getting anywhere else on American news.
[00:23:18.303 --> 00:23:20.544]  It is simply not getting out.
[00:23:20.544 --> 00:23:26.026]  You are breaking a story that other people aren't getting unless they watch C-SPAN.
[00:23:26.026 --> 00:23:30.067]  Well, let me pose this question to... Let me pose this question to Harry Brown and Paul Watson.
[00:23:30.811 --> 00:23:42.576]  In America, is it proper that we are on major city streets, not even around secure facilities, and people run up and scream, even with press passes, which we shouldn't even have to have, threatening to arrest us for videotaping?
[00:23:42.576 --> 00:23:47.378]  It's all color of law, and this is part of this process of people being afraid to even tape.
[00:23:47.378 --> 00:23:48.659]  Do you guys have any comments about that?
[00:23:51.119 --> 00:24:18.107]  Well, while you've been talking I've been surfing the net here and CNN has a story on the protesters down on the bottom of another story and they say that 1,700 have been arrested and they talk about the complaints about the conditions of those prisoners but I didn't find anything on the Fox News site and I find very little on the CBS site and that's as far as I've gotten so far.
[00:24:19.142 --> 00:24:23.225]  Well, it's normally 15 to 2,000 at any one time in the camp.
[00:24:23.225 --> 00:24:26.347]  They're normally there about 25 hours on average to spend on the local news.
[00:24:26.347 --> 00:24:27.367]  The police have met it.
[00:24:27.367 --> 00:24:29.849]  But then I look at the national news, I find almost nothing.
[00:24:29.849 --> 00:24:32.650]  And then I've talked to people from the union, it's been in the newspaper.
[00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:34.452]  The building is full of asbestos.
[00:24:34.452 --> 00:24:36.233]  The cops don't even want to work in there.
[00:24:36.233 --> 00:24:39.315]  Their union's complaining, and it's not even set up to be a jail.
[00:24:39.315 --> 00:24:47.940]  They have them just caged up behind barbed wire inside a 70-year-old bus terminal with literally an inch of grime and oil and chemicals on the ground, Harry.
[00:24:48.852 --> 00:24:50.134]  That's Pier 57.
[00:24:50.134 --> 00:24:52.216]  Now, question for you, Alex.
[00:24:52.216 --> 00:24:55.941]  How many people are there protesting, would you estimate?
[00:24:57.071 --> 00:25:00.452]  Well, again, the big combined march was on Sunday, over 300,000.
[00:25:00.452 --> 00:25:05.373]  I mean, these were marches five, ten blocks long, covering five streets.
[00:25:05.373 --> 00:25:07.374]  I mean, it was just ultra-massive.
[00:25:07.374 --> 00:25:12.055]  Everywhere I drove all over the city, 5,000 here, 10,000 there, 100,000 here, 20,000 there.
[00:25:12.055 --> 00:25:16.316]  And then now, throughout the week, basically, there's just protesters everywhere.
[00:25:16.316 --> 00:25:19.737]  Any street you go up, I've been all over the city, people with signs everywhere.
[00:25:19.737 --> 00:25:20.998]  You'll see we've got 10,000 here, 5,000 there, 200 here.
[00:25:20.998 --> 00:25:21.798]  It's just everywhere.
[00:25:27.043 --> 00:25:34.047]  The cabbies I've talked to, they say between 50 and 90% of people they've talked to, I get different numbers, hate it that the RNC is here.
[00:25:34.047 --> 00:25:36.608]  There's troops, guys, get video of these troops coming.
[00:25:36.608 --> 00:25:38.029]  Zoom in on that, guys, right there.
[00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:39.470]  Right there, there's troops.
[00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:40.290]  Get video of them.
[00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:43.152]  Go over there, come on, let's go over and talk to the troops.
[00:25:43.152 --> 00:25:45.253]  I mean, it is just blowing me away.
[00:25:45.253 --> 00:25:48.795]  And there's little gaggles of 2 to 20 National Guard just
[00:25:53.328 --> 00:25:56.310]  Just marching around all over the place.
[00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.870]  Yeah, that's good.
[00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:58.931]  From here, go ahead and get it from here.
[00:25:58.931 --> 00:26:02.293]  Police State 2004 live from New York City.
[00:26:02.293 --> 00:26:04.195]  It is Alex Jones.
[00:26:04.195 --> 00:26:08.017]  Paul, you have a comment or you want to ask Alex a question?
[00:26:09.045 --> 00:26:13.587]  Yeah, have you seen any examples of photographers and journalists being arrested?
[00:26:13.587 --> 00:26:21.551]  Because there was an article in the New York Daily News about how filmmakers who were actually filming a movie about protest were not involved in the protest.
[00:26:21.551 --> 00:26:26.254]  Alex is going back with that right after these words.
[00:26:26.254 --> 00:26:31.676]  Filmmakers, are they being arrested right after these words?
[00:26:31.676 --> 00:26:34.478]  This is Alex Jones Radio Program.
[00:26:45.194 --> 00:26:52.359]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:26:52.359 --> 00:26:53.921]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:26:53.921 --> 00:26:56.282]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:26:56.282 --> 00:26:58.644]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:26:58.644 --> 00:27:03.928]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:27:03.928 --> 00:27:07.951]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:27:08.191 --> 00:27:10.073]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:27:10.073 --> 00:27:20.865]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:27:20.865 --> 00:27:22.728]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:53.973]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:29:56.794 --> 00:30:08.480]  3,000 delegates, 300,000 protesters in a scene that sounds more like the description of chaos reminiscent of Kirk Russell's escape from New York.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:15.023]  It's Alex Jones live from New York, where he is at ground zero.
[00:30:15.023 --> 00:30:23.047]  And the question for Alex from Paul Joseph Watson, author of Order Out of Chaos, and we know what their order is going to be,
[00:30:23.847 --> 00:30:26.228]  Yes, what Paul brought up is totally accurate.
[00:30:26.228 --> 00:30:27.188]  They have these fences.
[00:30:40.954 --> 00:30:43.456]  And they will herd you into a corner and then just arrest everyone.
[00:30:43.456 --> 00:30:46.738]  I'm talking 75-year-old women, people in wheelchairs.
[00:30:46.738 --> 00:30:47.919]  It's indiscriminate.
[00:30:47.919 --> 00:30:51.222]  They grab everybody and put them in paddy wagons.
[00:30:51.222 --> 00:30:58.547]  And then I've got these young kids who are actually stirring up trouble, going, I don't know why, but a police captain and I actually did something and spit on a delegate's car.
[00:30:58.547 --> 00:31:01.229]  Nothing happened to me, but they arrested everybody and they told me I could go free.
[00:31:01.229 --> 00:31:03.451]  I mean, we have our own videotape saying that.
[00:31:03.451 --> 00:31:07.594]  So you also have useful idiots out doing bad things, and the cops just let them go.
[00:31:08.699 --> 00:31:09.980]  I mean, it's amazing!
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:17.945]  And I just had another person walk over to me and go, oh yeah, my family's Navy SEAL, and they called us on September 10th and said, they'll go to the World Trade Center tomorrow.
[00:31:17.945 --> 00:31:22.989]  I mean, it's just every five minutes somebody walks over and tells me a new story like this.
[00:31:22.989 --> 00:31:26.331]  Every day I've been out here at Ground Zero, it's just incredible.
[00:31:26.331 --> 00:31:29.313]  These are all New Yorkers who just work right around here.
[00:31:29.833 --> 00:31:33.017]  And people just sit there screaming at the police, telling them they know it's the New World Order.
[00:31:33.017 --> 00:31:34.058]  They know who's behind it.
[00:31:34.058 --> 00:31:36.861]  Listen, I'm gonna let you guys go and let you have the last word.
[00:31:36.861 --> 00:31:37.402]  God bless you.
[00:31:37.402 --> 00:31:39.164]  I want to thank Harry Brown, Paul Watson.
[00:31:39.164 --> 00:31:40.686]  I want to thank you, Erskine, for coming on.
[00:31:40.686 --> 00:31:42.548]  I want to have Harry Brown sit in in the future.
[00:31:42.548 --> 00:31:44.450]  I want to have Erskine do it, and just God bless you.
[00:31:45.417 --> 00:31:46.477]  God bless you, Alex.
[00:31:46.477 --> 00:31:47.858]  Take care of yourself.
[00:31:47.858 --> 00:31:49.518]  Take care of yourself.
[00:31:49.518 --> 00:31:50.599]  Let's go to Harry.
[00:31:50.599 --> 00:31:51.839]  Harry, any comments on this?
[00:31:51.839 --> 00:31:53.019]  This is awesome.
[00:31:53.019 --> 00:31:54.800]  This is absolutely awesome.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.620]  It is police state.
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:07.303]  Well, I've been looking at the web, as I said, while you folks have been talking, and I just don't find any indication in the news that there has been any violence there at all.
[00:32:07.303 --> 00:32:12.305]  In fact, there are specific statements that there has been no violence at all, and some
[00:32:12.965 --> 00:32:20.430]  A woman with the New York Civil Liberties Union said that she acknowledged that the police had been very gentle.
[00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:24.553]  So, it's not really getting into the news, that's for sure.
[00:32:24.553 --> 00:32:26.835]  And I don't... It's in the foreign news, Harry!
[00:32:26.835 --> 00:32:28.296]  It is in the foreign news!
[00:32:28.296 --> 00:32:33.139]  Now, what is... Well, I looked at BBC and I didn't find anything, but that's as far as I got.
[00:32:35.166 --> 00:32:37.669]  What particular foreign news have you seen?
[00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:42.194]  I have seen it on German, I've seen it on Canadian television.
[00:32:42.194 --> 00:32:47.760]  Both of them are leading off their news stories with the rioting in New York.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.962]  Paul, any comments?
[00:32:49.962 --> 00:32:54.627]  Well, yeah, I think there's been a couple of reports here on British television which have stories about it.
[00:32:55.205 --> 00:33:08.519]  Well, the major news line that I've been following is the New York Indian Media news line, which carries up-to-the-minute updates on exactly what's going down, and they were particularly evident on Tuesday night when there was a lot of trouble.
[00:33:08.519 --> 00:33:13.625]  So if listeners stay focused on the prisonplanet.com website tonight,
[00:33:14.165 --> 00:33:20.896]  As I would expect, with Bush giving his speech, if there was any real provocative action, it would occur tonight then.
[00:33:20.896 --> 00:33:22.999]  People keep tuned in to the website.
[00:33:22.999 --> 00:33:25.343]  I will provide them, you know, with any updates as they come in.
[00:33:26.508 --> 00:33:35.510]  So they've got a train all sitting to get Spirit Bush off of Manhattan and out of New York City.
[00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:38.370]  All sitting down below a special train.
[00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:42.311]  This is something when our leaders have to go by.
[00:33:42.311 --> 00:33:45.851]  Underground trains and we've got this type of a situation.
[00:33:45.851 --> 00:33:47.832]  America is in a state of siege.
[00:33:47.832 --> 00:33:49.572]  There's no question about it.
[00:33:49.572 --> 00:33:50.732]  We're scared of the world.
[00:33:50.732 --> 00:33:52.292]  The world is scared of us.
[00:33:52.292 --> 00:33:55.093]  And until we change our foreign policy, that's the way it's going to be.
[00:33:56.315 --> 00:33:57.036]  Amen, Harry.
[00:33:57.036 --> 00:33:58.317]  You're 100% right.
[00:33:58.317 --> 00:34:02.000]  And New World Order is trying to get order out of chaos.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.043]  This is elite-sponsored terrorism.
[00:34:05.043 --> 00:34:06.004]  Thank you, Paul.
[00:34:06.004 --> 00:34:11.629]  Thank you so very much, Harry Brown, for being on Alex Jones' radio program.
[00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:12.810]  We'll be back tomorrow.
[00:34:24.766 --> 00:34:26.253]  Oh, yeah.
