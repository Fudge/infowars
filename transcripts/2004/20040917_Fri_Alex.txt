[00:00:05.912 --> 00:00:06.553]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.233 --> 00:00:08.254]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.994 --> 00:00:10.095]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.756 --> 00:00:11.576]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.317 --> 00:00:13.258]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.898 --> 00:00:17.741]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.081 --> 00:00:22.165]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:24.766]  No, this is not Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.786 --> 00:00:29.188]  This is Erskine sitting in, just sitting in for Alex just today.
[00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.490]  He'll be back with you on Monday.
[00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.751]  Alex will be back on Monday.
[00:00:33.791 --> 00:00:36.933]  He's taking a well-deserved vacation.
[00:00:37.473 --> 00:00:46.758]  If you heard his reports that he's done on the Republican Convention, if you've heard what he's been doing, you and I both know Alex needs a bit of a vacation.
[00:00:47.318 --> 00:00:52.141]  And he's got, I'll guarantee you, he's got another video that he'll be coming out with
[00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:53.681]  You want the video?
[00:00:53.721 --> 00:00:58.142]  You've got to get American Dictators Staged Election 2004 1995 from Infowars.com or call 888-803-4438.
[00:00:58.162 --> 00:01:00.023]  Let me tell you how staged this election is.
[00:01:00.043 --> 00:01:02.163]  This is from Rule by Secrecy by Jim Mars.
[00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.281]  Nepotism runs deep in the order.
[00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:18.262]  We're talking about skull and bones.
[00:01:18.783 --> 00:01:21.445]  This is the thing that you're not hearing too much about.
[00:01:21.945 --> 00:01:35.475]  Nepotism runs deep in the order, as seen in the fact that modern finances of the Russell Trust were handled by John B. Madden Jr., a partner in Brown Brothers Harriman, formed by the mergers of Brown Brothers Company and W.A.
[00:01:35.515 --> 00:01:37.096]  Harriman Company in 1933.
[00:01:37.896 --> 00:01:42.980]  Madden started there in 1940, working under senior partner Prescott Bush.
[00:01:44.013 --> 00:01:48.396]  Father of former President George Bush, all of them members of Skull and Bones.
[00:01:48.836 --> 00:01:52.459]  We're going to give you an example of what Skull and Bones has done.
[00:01:52.959 --> 00:02:01.845]  Now, there you've got the Brown Brothers Harriman, all of them part of Skull and Bones, all of them financing who?
[00:02:02.446 --> 00:02:03.266]  Adolf Hitler.
[00:02:03.647 --> 00:02:05.008]  The same thing coming through.
[00:02:05.388 --> 00:02:09.751]  But you think, well, you know, I'm not going to vote for Bush, Mr. Skull and Bones!
[00:02:10.467 --> 00:02:11.849]  I think I'll vote for Mr. Kerry.
[00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:14.332]  Well, you got the same thing going in.
[00:02:14.472 --> 00:02:16.134]  And how friendly have they been?
[00:02:16.214 --> 00:02:18.236]  We're going to talk about that when we get back.
[00:02:18.817 --> 00:02:29.829]  The other thing that has been going on that I've been keeping up with, and I know you have on the radio, on the TV, especially at Infowars.com, is the war in Iraq going badly.
[00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.171]  As we told you yesterday,
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:39.362]  Even the Secretary General of the United Nations, a group that I hold very little respect for, said the war there is illegal.
[00:02:39.602 --> 00:02:56.288]  Yeah, like I'm going to really give a big rat's patoot what the Secretary General of the United Nations tells America, but the fact is we've got our own people telling the President, our own National Security Council telling him it's going to go even worse next year.
[00:02:56.428 --> 00:02:56.768]  Worse?
[00:02:57.717 --> 00:03:01.739]  There are very few cities that the United States can go into right now.
[00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:09.262]  It is an absolute disaster and they're saying civil war next year if they don't have it already.
[00:03:09.683 --> 00:03:14.225]  And what we're going to be doing is driving Iraq right into the arms of whom?
[00:03:14.865 --> 00:03:15.325]  Iran.
[00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:21.568]  So this is going extremely bad for the United States.
[00:03:21.748 --> 00:03:22.909]  What are they trying to do?
[00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.930]  We've got the illegals coming over.
[00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.891]  We've got the outsourcing of jobs.
[00:03:26.971 --> 00:03:27.391]  We've got
[00:03:28.047 --> 00:03:33.835]  You just look around, it's like they're trying to totally dismantle and tear down America.
[00:03:34.676 --> 00:03:37.159]  It is like they're trying to tear down America.
[00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:41.364]  They've got the free trade agreements of the Americas.
[00:03:41.604 --> 00:03:44.268]  It's like they're trying to tear down our entire country.
[00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.254]  Well, perhaps they are because they want a one world government.
[00:03:49.714 --> 00:03:50.354]  This is it.
[00:03:50.595 --> 00:03:56.580]  This is the master, the matrix of evil for the one world government.
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.661]  You've got religions even pushing for it.
[00:03:59.262 --> 00:04:02.464]  My neighbor came by telling me about this new religion he belonged to.
[00:04:03.325 --> 00:04:05.527]  And yes, we've got to all be brothers.
[00:04:05.607 --> 00:04:07.108]  We have to work in brotherhood.
[00:04:07.148 --> 00:04:08.929]  We have to work in peace and harmony.
[00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.273]  Wouldn't it be great if we all operated under one world government?
[00:04:13.857 --> 00:04:18.847]  And I looked at him and I said, You know, we've seen one world government.
[00:04:18.907 --> 00:04:20.249]  We've seen it in Somalia.
[00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.213]  We've seen it in Bosnia.
[00:04:22.734 --> 00:04:24.237]  It's working beautiful, isn't it?
[00:04:25.109 --> 00:04:27.271]  Well, you know, it's all because of religion.
[00:04:27.852 --> 00:04:35.619]  No, friends, don't buy into that argument that everything that's going wrong in the world today is because of religion.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.261]  It isn't religion.
[00:04:37.621 --> 00:04:39.643]  It's the banksters, the corporations.
[00:04:40.003 --> 00:04:41.004]  We're going to come back.
[00:04:41.104 --> 00:04:47.971]  We're going to talk about our choices for president right here on the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:49.012]  Thank you for listening.
[00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:52.406]  I don't know.
[00:05:03.797 --> 00:05:09.259]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:13.920]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:21.202]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.562 --> 00:05:27.684]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.824 --> 00:05:29.024]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.224 --> 00:05:29.705]  We're good to go.
[00:05:46.164 --> 00:05:49.288]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.

[00:06:12.386 --> 00:06:19.969]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.

[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.982]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:02.952 --> 00:07:05.953]  The behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:07:06.073 --> 00:07:09.974]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:07:10.014 --> 00:07:14.255]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:07:14.595 --> 00:07:18.376]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:07:18.456 --> 00:07:20.337]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:07:20.897 --> 00:07:23.820]  Police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.584]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:07:28.744 --> 00:07:31.787]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[00:07:31.967 --> 00:07:34.829]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:41.435]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:07:41.955 --> 00:07:45.758]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:07:52.544 --> 00:07:53.285]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.120]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.801 --> 00:08:11.621]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.361 --> 00:08:13.262]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.282 --> 00:08:17.863]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:22.185]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:31.181 --> 00:08:33.842]  Plus, we're available on the Internet.
[00:08:33.882 --> 00:08:38.845]  If you want to get in touch with me, www.erskinonradio.com.

[00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:54.233]  This weekend, we've got Christian Wild, who's going to be discussing hidden causes of heart attacks, and then ours two and three, Mr. Ted Gunderson, former head of the Los Angeles office of the FBI, is going to talk about...
[00:08:54.833 --> 00:09:04.184]  What's really going on concerning the pedophilia, yes, of a lot of the elitists and the war on terror that's happening in the United States.
[00:09:04.224 --> 00:09:05.525]  It's a war on Americans.
[00:09:05.926 --> 00:09:14.075]  We're talking a little bit about the similarity of Skull and Bones Kerry, Skull and Bones Bush, and I'm going to quote from Book Rule by Secrecy by Jim Mars.
[00:09:14.927 --> 00:09:15.427]  Excellent book.
[00:09:15.488 --> 00:09:16.408]  I highly recommend it.
[00:09:16.428 --> 00:09:18.390]  It also just came out in paperbacks.
[00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:19.971]  You can get it fairly inexpensively.
[00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:31.440]  A more recent example of members' fierce loyalty was shown in the 1980 scandal of President Bush's connection with the criminal activity in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, BCCI.
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:39.666]  As the bank's illegal activities came to light, involving many prominent names, attempts were made by the Bush administration to block
[00:09:40.326 --> 00:09:41.946]  Any meaningful investigation.
[00:09:42.507 --> 00:09:51.149]  Finally, a formal investigation of BCCI was launched by the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics, and International Operations.
[00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:52.549]  Who headed that committee?
[00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:53.669]  John Kerry.
[00:09:54.149 --> 00:10:01.331]  Kerry was chairman of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, which had received significant BCCI contributions.
[00:10:01.871 --> 00:10:04.672]  Member of Skull and Bones, the Kerry-led investigation
[00:10:06.431 --> 00:10:06.952]  Floundered.
[00:10:07.292 --> 00:10:15.219]  Jack Bloom, a special counsel to Kerry's subcommittee, stated, I proposed a serious investigation of BCCI and I was pressed aside.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:24.007]  A high-level cover-up of everything concerning BCCI was set in place after customs stumbled across the money laundering operations in Miami.
[00:10:24.588 --> 00:10:26.029]  And it's still in place.
[00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.092]  What you've got here is one bonesman...
[00:10:29.804 --> 00:10:32.387]  Covering up for another Bonesman.
[00:10:32.487 --> 00:10:35.571]  Now, you're saying, okay, so that skull and bones are covering up.
[00:10:35.611 --> 00:10:37.293]  They had the BCCI scandal.
[00:10:37.674 --> 00:10:40.097]  What does this have to do with America today?
[00:10:40.117 --> 00:10:48.768]  A 1980 study of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs entitled, Structure of Corporate Concentration.
[00:10:49.489 --> 00:10:52.551]  Its conclusion was reported by Donald Gibson.
[00:10:53.071 --> 00:11:02.757]  Financial institutions part of or extensively interrelated with the Morgan Rockefeller complex are the dominant force in our economy.
[00:11:03.298 --> 00:11:05.079]  This is the dominant force.
[00:11:05.119 --> 00:11:08.981]  The Morgan Rockefeller is the dominant force.
[00:11:09.161 --> 00:11:18.287]  After studying the report, he said, the directors, this Donald Gibson, studying the 1980 Senate report said, the board of directors of Morgan Rockefeller
[00:11:19.159 --> 00:11:22.469]  Included individuals serving on the boards of 31 of the top 100 firms.
[00:11:25.626 --> 00:11:28.427]  Citicorp was tied to 49 top companies.
[00:11:28.907 --> 00:11:35.748]  Chase Manhattan, Chemical Bank, Metropolitan Life had 24 other top companies represented on their boards.
[00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:50.952]  These and a multitude of other overlaps among the top 100 firms provide a dense network of relationships reinforced by frequent ties through private clubs, educational background, marriages, membership in organizations such as
[00:11:51.826 --> 00:11:57.229]  Council on Foreign Relations, Skull and Bones, Trilateral Commission, and the Business Council.
[00:11:57.829 --> 00:12:07.514]  Skull and Bones controls so many of these companies, or they have board directors on so many of these companies, and you're looking at that, and there's the economy of the United States of America.
[00:12:08.375 --> 00:12:11.937]  That is what the problem is when you've got Skull and Bones controlling them.
[00:12:12.197 --> 00:12:12.977]  How can you fight it?
[00:12:13.418 --> 00:12:14.598]  Go to your small stores.
[00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:15.759]  Go to your farmer.
[00:12:15.799 --> 00:12:16.859]  Go to your individuals.
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.601]  Stay away from corporate, corporate, corporate.
[00:12:20.259 --> 00:12:28.581]  Let's go immediately to the phones, and BJ, in Florida, where you were lucky on this one, unless you're in the Pensacola area, where are you located, BJ?
[00:12:28.601 --> 00:12:30.361]  No, I'm right outside of Orlando.
[00:12:31.422 --> 00:12:34.202]  Oh, you're right outside Disneyland, so you're okay.
[00:12:34.242 --> 00:12:35.803]  No, I'm further north than that.
[00:12:36.783 --> 00:12:38.683]  Oh, Jay, you've got a question.
[00:12:39.103 --> 00:12:40.084]  Huh?
[00:12:40.124 --> 00:12:40.844]  You're in where?
[00:12:40.864 --> 00:12:42.044]  I'm in Mount Dora.
[00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:43.324]  I've been there.
[00:12:43.584 --> 00:12:44.505]  Yeah, great little town.
[00:12:44.525 --> 00:12:46.185]  I know where that is, so go ahead and tell me.
[00:12:46.225 --> 00:12:47.805]  You've got a comment or a question?
[00:12:48.306 --> 00:12:49.786]  I have a comment.
[00:12:50.709 --> 00:12:52.010]  My idea is this.
[00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:59.056]  How many people listen to Alex Jones, John Stattmiller, The Power Hour, and so forth, and you, and so forth?
[00:12:59.616 --> 00:13:00.677]  How many people would you guess?
[00:13:01.778 --> 00:13:04.821]  I would say that we have, I have no idea.
[00:13:04.841 --> 00:13:05.761]  Fifteen million?
[00:13:05.841 --> 00:13:06.422]  Ten million?
[00:13:07.423 --> 00:13:09.044]  Well, maybe that many.
[00:13:09.084 --> 00:13:09.525]  Yes, sir.
[00:13:09.665 --> 00:13:12.027]  Well, we're all pretty well informed if we listen to you.
[00:13:12.367 --> 00:13:14.829]  And most of us don't know who in the heck to vote for.
[00:13:15.504 --> 00:13:20.627]  I would say vote American, the Constitution Party, for Peruca.
[00:13:21.927 --> 00:13:24.509]  You know, I've come to the same conclusion.
[00:13:24.569 --> 00:13:25.389]  I've been looking at you.
[00:13:25.409 --> 00:13:26.790]  You certainly can't vote for Bush.
[00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:27.971]  You can't vote for Kerry.
[00:13:28.051 --> 00:13:28.391]  Absolutely.
[00:13:28.411 --> 00:13:30.512]  The Libertarian's a little whacked out for me.
[00:13:30.592 --> 00:13:34.914]  So, you know, you've got to vote for a third party.
[00:13:34.994 --> 00:13:42.118]  If we can raise that 5% to 10% or even 15%, maybe everybody will start wakening up, you know?
[00:13:43.208 --> 00:13:44.168]  But that's my solution.
[00:13:44.188 --> 00:13:45.289]  We want answers.
[00:13:45.329 --> 00:13:48.529]  You know, we've heard the same rhetoric over and over and over again.
[00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:50.750]  And we need answers.
[00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:51.630]  What can we do?
[00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:56.431]  And the best thing we can do is vote for the Constitution Party because that's our Bible.
[00:13:56.892 --> 00:13:58.072]  That's what we go by.
[00:13:58.112 --> 00:13:59.332]  That's our manifesto.
[00:13:59.752 --> 00:14:02.313]  And if we are losing that, we better go ahead and regain it.
[00:14:02.393 --> 00:14:06.274]  And this guy that is running Peruca, he says, I have no trouble with the Bible.
[00:14:06.815 --> 00:14:08.617]  I have no trouble with the Constitution.
[00:14:08.997 --> 00:14:22.450]  I have no trouble with shutting the borders, kicking the illegals out of here, bringing our factories back, putting up the tariffs and so forth and so forth, and getting out of United Nations, NAFTA, GATT, everything that I believe in and you believe in.
[00:14:22.871 --> 00:14:23.912]  So this man should be president.
[00:14:23.992 --> 00:14:24.272]  Absolutely.
[00:14:24.292 --> 00:14:26.574]  We carry sovereignty of America to Americans.
[00:14:26.614 --> 00:14:26.814]  Yeah.
[00:14:27.035 --> 00:14:28.116]  So that's all I have to say.
[00:14:28.156 --> 00:14:30.418]  You people vote for the Constitution Party.
[00:14:30.558 --> 00:14:31.319]  That's our Bible.
[00:14:32.449 --> 00:14:34.731]  Well, you know, I can't really disagree with that.
[00:14:34.771 --> 00:14:37.894]  There are a couple of other people saying some good things.
[00:14:37.954 --> 00:14:39.315]  Thank you, BJ, for the call.
[00:14:39.335 --> 00:14:42.458]  A couple of other people saying some extraordinarily good things.
[00:14:42.618 --> 00:14:44.240]  One is Mr. Pat Buchanan.
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:50.906]  Another person who's saying, as always, some extraordinarily good things is Representative Ron Paul.
[00:14:51.366 --> 00:14:52.147]  God bless him.
[00:14:52.728 --> 00:14:54.049]  But the Constitution...
[00:14:55.265 --> 00:14:57.307]  That's what's interesting about the Constitution.
[00:14:57.347 --> 00:15:16.663]  The Constitution Party and the Constitution, they realized that the Constitution gave us rights and the rights, they didn't give it to us through the Constitution because our founding fathers realized that our rights came from God, not from any government, any document, any piece of paper.
[00:15:17.423 --> 00:15:19.285]  But they're certainly being taken away from us.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.401]  Watching the news today.
[00:15:21.501 --> 00:15:23.322]  What's going on in the war on terrorism?
[00:15:23.382 --> 00:15:25.904]  I turn on CNN and immediately what do they tell me?
[00:15:26.725 --> 00:15:28.266]  Oh, well, we're going to be a step up.
[00:15:28.286 --> 00:15:31.048]  We're following the recommendations of the 9-11 Commission.
[00:15:31.088 --> 00:15:34.991]  This is the commission who never looked into what was known before 9-11.
[00:15:35.711 --> 00:15:43.057]  This is the same commission that never looked into who was really responsible for 9-11, but we're going to follow their recommendations.
[00:15:43.737 --> 00:15:44.658]  So what do they recommend?
[00:15:45.583 --> 00:15:48.185]  You better take your jacket off if you're going through.
[00:15:48.305 --> 00:15:50.707]  And, you know, we're going to do a lot more pat-downs.
[00:15:51.927 --> 00:15:53.829]  Okay, more pat-downs.
[00:15:53.889 --> 00:15:54.929]  Take your jacket off.
[00:15:54.989 --> 00:15:56.310]  Get your ID card.
[00:15:56.691 --> 00:15:58.312]  Get your RFIDs.
[00:15:58.452 --> 00:16:00.593]  That's exactly what they're talking about.
[00:16:01.354 --> 00:16:04.376]  More, more, more controls over us.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.661]  The people who didn't do anything.
[00:16:06.861 --> 00:16:09.382]  The people who aren't doing anything.
[00:16:09.882 --> 00:16:16.985]  And the people who are being subjected daily to this incursion by the federal government into our lives.
[00:16:17.745 --> 00:16:19.045]  We're not responsible.
[00:16:19.586 --> 00:16:23.127]  I didn't see anybody responsible that I know of.
[00:16:23.447 --> 00:16:27.389]  I mean, the only people responsible, I didn't see anybody black responsible.
[00:16:27.409 --> 00:16:29.029]  I didn't see anybody even Mexican.
[00:16:29.049 --> 00:16:30.830]  I didn't see anybody police responsible.
[00:16:31.428 --> 00:16:33.329]  I didn't see anybody Irish.
[00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:35.210]  Didn't see anybody Italian over there.
[00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.311]  Didn't see anybody Chinese or Japanese.
[00:16:38.211 --> 00:16:43.774]  I did see some people who they are claiming were responsible who were Saudi Arabian.
[00:16:44.734 --> 00:16:45.895]  So what do we do?
[00:16:46.035 --> 00:16:46.955]  We attack Iraq.
[00:16:47.595 --> 00:16:48.716]  Of course, it makes a lot of sense.
[00:16:48.756 --> 00:16:50.257]  Well, they're right next to Saudi Arabia.
[00:16:50.757 --> 00:16:54.919]  Besides, who's in business with the royal family of Saud?
[00:16:55.799 --> 00:16:58.000]  The only country named after a family.
[00:16:58.901 --> 00:16:59.461]  The Bushes.
[00:17:00.109 --> 00:17:01.229]  The Carlisle Group.
[00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:08.752]  The Bin Laden family is the family that built our military bases in Saudi Arabia.
[00:17:09.352 --> 00:17:15.694]  The family that built our military bases in Saudi Arabia is the Bin Laden family.
[00:17:16.374 --> 00:17:18.175]  Of course we're friends with them.
[00:17:19.135 --> 00:17:21.236]  Now, on the economy.
[00:17:21.496 --> 00:17:22.576]  Switch one other place.
[00:17:23.425 --> 00:17:34.870]  On the economy, the GAO, General Accounting Office, says that by 2009, we will not be able to pay the interest on the national debt.
[00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.391]  It is going up astronomically.
[00:17:37.892 --> 00:17:38.772]  Astronomically.
[00:17:39.492 --> 00:17:44.315]  You know, when I was a kid, I was told, Erskine, and I said, huh?
[00:17:44.475 --> 00:17:45.575]  Which is southern for what?
[00:17:45.995 --> 00:17:46.556]  I said, huh?
[00:17:46.916 --> 00:17:51.518]  And they said, you know, you're not going to live to get your Social Security.
[00:17:52.597 --> 00:17:53.278]  Well, you know what?
[00:17:53.318 --> 00:17:54.258]  They're probably right.
[00:17:54.319 --> 00:17:59.863]  Very few of us are going to live to get Social Security because the whole system is going to be broke.
[00:17:59.943 --> 00:18:02.385]  Why do you think they're putting in these measures?
[00:18:02.986 --> 00:18:12.914]  Because when the economy falls and the people become really, really upset, they're going to have to have some way to control the American public.
[00:18:13.454 --> 00:18:15.216]  And that's what they're putting them in for.
[00:18:15.716 --> 00:18:18.759]  Of course, in my estimation, Bush will be re-elected.
[00:18:19.864 --> 00:18:23.686]  They didn't put in all these rules and regulations to give them away.
[00:18:24.206 --> 00:18:25.206]  But then does it matter?
[00:18:26.047 --> 00:18:29.588]  If you get one skull and bones or another skull and bones, do they really care?
[00:18:30.068 --> 00:18:33.670]  You've got to vote for a third party if for nothing else a protest.
[00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:40.693]  I don't want to be here saying next year, well, I didn't vote for Kerry or I didn't vote for Bush, you know.
[00:18:42.774 --> 00:18:45.435]  I'm not going to be doing that type of thing.
[00:18:45.515 --> 00:18:48.256]  I'm going to be saying I voted for a third party.
[00:18:48.945 --> 00:18:54.826]  And more people will awaken, we might have a whole lot better situation.
[00:18:54.846 --> 00:18:56.367]  Now, questions that people ask.
[00:18:56.467 --> 00:18:59.007]  What's it going to take to wake the American public up?
[00:18:59.507 --> 00:19:07.729]  Alex Jones is waking the American public up with his videos, with his radio program, with the programming that you're hearing on GCN.
[00:19:07.929 --> 00:19:09.170]  We're waking America up.
[00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:13.171]  More and more people are becoming aware of what's going on.
[00:19:13.431 --> 00:19:14.911]  They're starting to awaken.
[00:19:15.635 --> 00:19:23.239]  And watch out, New World Order, when America wakes up, and the people wake up, they're not going to wake up friendly.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:37.607]  The videos, American Dictators, Staged Election 2004, and the Police State videos, and the Matrix of Evil, any of the videos by Alex Jones will tell you what's really going on in this country.
[00:19:38.519 --> 00:19:42.863]  We're going to be back with your calls right here on the Alex Jones Radio Program.

[00:20:03.337 --> 00:20:04.378]  The war on terrorism.
[00:20:04.718 --> 00:20:07.501]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:20:07.761 --> 00:20:11.925]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:20:12.346 --> 00:20:13.166]  So what do you do?
[00:20:13.507 --> 00:20:18.071]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:20.672]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[00:22:24.142 --> 00:22:26.082]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:22:52.168 --> 00:22:52.629]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.712 --> 00:23:03.073]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:23:03.334 --> 00:23:07.156]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:23:07.476 --> 00:23:08.297]  Read the labels.

[00:23:13.079 --> 00:23:17.262]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.

[00:24:23.018 --> 00:24:36.585]  Hey, that's some good tracks that he's laying down this morning.
[00:24:37.605 --> 00:24:39.726]  This is the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[00:24:39.766 --> 00:24:43.508]  This is Erskine coming at you, or this afternoon, depending on where you're located.
[00:24:44.068 --> 00:24:47.929]  Happy to be with you, and our program that I do is called Erskine Overnight.
[00:24:48.049 --> 00:24:52.831]  It's heard every Saturday night on most of the GCN stations and also on the internet.
[00:24:52.851 --> 00:24:54.652]  Sorry, we're not on shortwave.
[00:24:54.692 --> 00:24:55.912]  We can't afford it right now.
[00:24:55.932 --> 00:24:57.993]  We're not on there, but I appreciate it.
[00:24:58.713 --> 00:25:01.474]  Constitution Day, that is what today is.
[00:25:01.494 --> 00:25:02.654]  A lot of people don't know it.
[00:25:02.714 --> 00:25:03.815]  It's Constitution Day.
[00:25:03.835 --> 00:25:06.216]  It's one of the things they don't want you talking about.
[00:25:07.696 --> 00:25:10.057]  What do you mean, Erskine, they don't want you talking about it?
[00:25:10.237 --> 00:25:10.457]  Well...
[00:25:11.249 --> 00:25:17.110]  There are a little over 842 books that the FBI is going to look at you if you're taking them out of the library.
[00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:19.751]  Well, if I'm taking them out of the library, who cares?
[00:25:19.811 --> 00:25:20.611]  Well, they do.
[00:25:20.711 --> 00:25:22.111]  They're getting the records.
[00:25:22.151 --> 00:25:23.291]  They're checking it twice.
[00:25:23.351 --> 00:25:27.012]  It's sort of like Santa Claus going to find out who's reading what's naughty and what's nice.
[00:25:27.912 --> 00:25:29.272]  They've got reading controls.
[00:25:29.332 --> 00:25:30.073]  Yes, they do.
[00:25:30.133 --> 00:25:31.533]  They've got reading controls.
[00:25:31.593 --> 00:25:34.093]  They are real concerned about the books you're checking out.
[00:25:34.113 --> 00:25:35.614]  You want to order it from Amazon?
[00:25:35.654 --> 00:25:37.874]  Yeah, they might even be concerned about that one, too.
[00:25:39.122 --> 00:25:42.204]  So, you're looking at that, and what sort of books do they have?
[00:25:43.144 --> 00:25:50.889]  Well, I'm certainly not going to check out a book on how to make bombs, the anarchist cookbook, I don't think I'm going to get that one, and maybe a book on this, that, or that.
[00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:52.350]  No, they don't care.
[00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:54.271]  You can check all those out that you want to.
[00:25:54.571 --> 00:25:56.132]  How about how to make a nuclear bomb?
[00:25:56.172 --> 00:25:57.013]  Yeah, that'd be cool.
[00:25:57.253 --> 00:25:58.133]  No, they don't care.
[00:25:58.233 --> 00:25:58.794]  Check it out.
[00:25:58.894 --> 00:25:59.354]  Enjoy it.
[00:26:00.012 --> 00:26:00.872]  Knock yourself out.
[00:26:01.392 --> 00:26:06.313]  But you get a book like Thomas Jefferson and the Constitution, they're real concerned about that.
[00:26:06.533 --> 00:26:07.553]  We've got to look at this person.
[00:26:07.573 --> 00:26:09.354]  He's reading up about the Constitution.
[00:26:09.394 --> 00:26:10.354]  He could be a problem.
[00:26:10.414 --> 00:26:11.314]  He's a troublemaker.
[00:26:11.354 --> 00:26:12.254]  He's a terrorist.
[00:26:13.374 --> 00:26:15.995]  Those are the books that they're concerned about.
[00:26:16.655 --> 00:26:20.296]  So this Constitution Day, think back to the Constitution.
[00:26:20.336 --> 00:26:27.977]  If you've ever been in the military, if you're a civil servant, if you are a person who's a police officer, think back to the Constitution.
[00:26:29.048 --> 00:26:31.269]  You take an oath on the Constitution.
[00:26:32.049 --> 00:26:36.331]  You take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States of America.
[00:26:36.651 --> 00:26:44.594]  You don't take an oath for the particular government, but you do take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States of America.
[00:26:44.614 --> 00:26:45.675]  It's a great document.
[00:26:46.375 --> 00:26:49.736]  It protects our God-given liberties.
[00:26:50.236 --> 00:26:54.478]  It protects our God-given liberties, and it restricts our government.
[00:26:55.098 --> 00:26:57.039]  It keeps our government off our backs.
[00:26:58.092 --> 00:27:12.423]  And while the people after 9-11 started waving the flag and waving their rights, the rights that so many Americans fought and died for, in an instant, boom, 9-11, Americans said, we don't care.
[00:27:13.243 --> 00:27:20.389]  You give up freedom for security, according to Benjamin Franklin, and he was absolutely right, you end up with neither.
[00:27:20.749 --> 00:27:21.990]  That's where we are today.
[00:27:22.631 --> 00:27:24.693]  Let's go to Jim in Illinois.
[00:27:24.753 --> 00:27:28.375]  Jim, welcome to the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[00:27:28.395 --> 00:27:29.376]  How you doing, Erskine?
[00:27:29.937 --> 00:27:32.058]  I'm doing great and grand and fabulous.
[00:27:32.118 --> 00:27:32.939]  How about yourself?
[00:27:33.059 --> 00:27:33.699]  Pretty good.
[00:27:33.779 --> 00:27:34.840]  It's a pleasure to talk to you.
[00:27:35.581 --> 00:27:36.521]  It's a pleasure.
[00:27:37.302 --> 00:27:40.905]  I have a major concern, and maybe you can talk about this.
[00:27:41.485 --> 00:27:50.452]  You know, what's going on in Florida, Alabama, and up and down the Gulf, you know, no one really talked about
[00:27:51.167 --> 00:27:52.187]  We're good to go.
[00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:26.057]  You know, on that, I don't know, because there's so many people who are still out of power and everything else, and you've got those torrential rains moving on up through Tennessee.
[00:28:26.097 --> 00:28:28.840]  They're going to be hitting our friends up in Kentucky real short.
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.503]  So it's going on up there, and we're always having disasters.
[00:28:32.963 --> 00:28:34.625]  This is when they should be streaming in.
[00:28:35.145 --> 00:28:40.050]  What they did, and maybe we're better off that they aren't there to a degree, because...
[00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:52.715]  I was talking to some people about what they did after Hurricane Charlie because Charlie went through a very narrow band there Jim and it hit like a 20 mile band and it just really devastated anything in that area.
[00:28:53.255 --> 00:28:56.496]  But the people it hit were a lot of people who were in mobile homes.
[00:28:56.916 --> 00:29:02.018]  The people it hit were a lot of the people who were just good old fashioned working class people
[00:29:02.879 --> 00:29:06.760]  And they didn't hit a lot of the rich Republican in Florida.
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:11.602]  They call them enclaves, where they had the big walls built around the... You know, you've seen those.
[00:29:11.662 --> 00:29:12.582]  Right, yeah.
[00:29:13.162 --> 00:29:14.743]  Yeah, they've got a lot of those.
[00:29:15.343 --> 00:29:22.245]  And they put all the people into a barbed wire area, and they had M-16s, armed soldiers around there.
[00:29:22.445 --> 00:29:23.306]  They didn't want them out.
[00:29:23.726 --> 00:29:25.727]  And they had special guards around the enclaves.
[00:29:25.767 --> 00:29:27.007]  They gave them K-rations.
[00:29:27.588 --> 00:29:30.152]  This is what we're doing to our own people anymore?
[00:29:30.172 --> 00:29:31.414]  Talk about plants.
[00:29:31.495 --> 00:29:34.320]  Maybe we're better off that they didn't have a lot of plants.
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:38.828]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Radio Program right after these words.
[00:29:51.838 --> 00:29:52.741]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.243 --> 00:29:54.828]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.848 --> 00:29:58.459]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.597 --> 00:30:04.077]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:30:04.278 --> 00:30:11.620]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:16.341]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:30:16.621 --> 00:30:26.444]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[00:30:27.205 --> 00:30:30.869]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:33.693]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[00:30:33.713 --> 00:30:39.941]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[00:30:40.181 --> 00:30:41.743]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[00:30:41.983 --> 00:30:42.883]  Friends, don't wait.
[00:30:42.963 --> 00:30:45.944]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[00:30:46.104 --> 00:30:49.725]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[00:30:49.965 --> 00:30:52.646]  That's 800-255-1912.
[00:30:52.726 --> 00:30:56.788]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's food supply updates.
[00:30:56.948 --> 00:30:57.828]  It's powerful stuff.
[00:31:01.829 --> 00:31:09.335]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:31:09.616 --> 00:31:20.525]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:31:20.785 --> 00:31:21.206]  We're good to go.
[00:31:37.288 --> 00:31:37.788]  That's right.
[00:31:37.948 --> 00:31:45.072]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:31:45.372 --> 00:31:54.116]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:54.136 --> 00:31:54.617]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.401]  Did you remember to take your focus factor this morning?
[00:32:04.821 --> 00:32:05.081]  No?
[00:32:05.481 --> 00:32:06.062]  Too bad.
[00:32:06.502 --> 00:32:15.265]  Every morning, men, women, and children across the country start their day with focus factor because they rely on it to feed their brain from the time they get up to the time they go to bed.
[00:32:15.745 --> 00:32:26.329]  Focus factor contains vitamins, minerals, protective antioxidants, botanical extracts, and omega-3 fatty acids, some of which have been demonstrated in clinical studies to support healthy brain function.
[00:32:26.769 --> 00:32:29.650]  Focus factor is perfect for business professionals, homemade
[00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:30.450]  We're good to go.
[00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:31.050]  We're good to go.
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:57.322]  We're good to go.
[00:33:04.753 --> 00:33:05.153]  Don't worry.
[00:33:05.713 --> 00:33:07.174]  This show is documented.
[00:33:07.734 --> 00:33:10.476]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:10.936 --> 00:33:14.437]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:33:14.877 --> 00:33:18.999]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.460]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[00:33:22.401 --> 00:33:23.741]  The ring of fire.
[00:33:24.682 --> 00:33:26.202]  The ring of fire.
[00:33:27.343 --> 00:33:29.484]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[00:33:30.824 --> 00:33:36.186]  I like Alex's music.
[00:33:36.226 --> 00:33:38.306]  This is Erskine sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:33:39.046 --> 00:33:42.907]  www.infowars.com You know Alex's website.
[00:33:43.447 --> 00:33:46.988]  And did you see where they sold a lot of Johnny Cash memorabilia?
[00:33:47.388 --> 00:33:49.549]  They thought it'd bring, oh, a couple of million dollars.
[00:33:49.609 --> 00:33:50.949]  It brought four million dollars.
[00:33:51.009 --> 00:33:53.550]  People like the man in black even today.
[00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:55.190]  And that Ring of Fire was a good one.
[00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:57.331]  He was absolutely something.
[00:33:57.911 --> 00:34:01.673]  Absolutely an outstanding performer, outstanding person.
[00:34:02.394 --> 00:34:10.098]  One of the things that we were talking about, we've been talking about the economy, the war in Iraq, and the election of the two different people.
[00:34:10.718 --> 00:34:12.119]  Breaking news is just in.
[00:34:12.479 --> 00:34:17.782]  An FBI agent shot at acquaintance of a border watch group member while trying to serve an arrest warrant.
[00:34:18.142 --> 00:34:19.202]  This happened Thursday.
[00:34:19.242 --> 00:34:21.123]  It happened at 11.15 p.m.
[00:34:21.164 --> 00:34:23.885]  Wednesday in a grocery store parking lot in Douglas, Arizona.
[00:34:24.525 --> 00:34:24.925]  We're good to go.
[00:34:24.965 --> 00:34:25.245]  I think?
[00:34:45.735 --> 00:34:49.438]  Raising concerns among migrant groups about potential abuses.
[00:34:49.918 --> 00:34:51.159]  They call them migrant groups.
[00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:52.580]  They're illegal aliens.
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:55.282]  What do they not understand about illegal?
[00:34:56.103 --> 00:35:10.153]  Well, Nethercott at the time was with 22-year-old Kaylin Riddle, and Charlene Thornton, special agent in charge of the Phoenix FBI office, said that actions taken by Nethercott and Riddle led one of the FBI agents to fire his weapon.
[00:35:10.842 --> 00:35:11.803]  They wouldn't elaborate.
[00:35:12.063 --> 00:35:14.184]  Won't release the name of the agent who fired the shot.
[00:35:14.765 --> 00:35:18.247]  Riddle was airlifted to Tucson Hospital, so they didn't know his condition.
[00:35:18.808 --> 00:35:19.528]  He was arrested.
[00:35:19.548 --> 00:35:20.629]  Nethercott was arrested.
[00:35:20.669 --> 00:35:22.350]  Wednesday is in federal custody.
[00:35:23.671 --> 00:35:29.595]  According to the warrant, Nethercott refused to pull over for border agents on August 31st after a slow-speed chase.
[00:35:30.529 --> 00:35:34.851]  He entered a compound in Douglas occupied by members of Ranch Rescue.
[00:35:35.431 --> 00:35:38.252]  Riddle was identified as one of the people in the compound.
[00:35:38.753 --> 00:35:42.034]  The Ranch Rescue members were heavily armed with night vision equipment.
[00:35:42.474 --> 00:35:45.415]  Border Patrol agents yelled for Nethercutt to show his hands.
[00:35:45.776 --> 00:35:46.516]  He refused.
[00:35:46.936 --> 00:35:48.197]  I'm going to take care of myself.
[00:35:48.257 --> 00:35:49.877]  We're going to have a shootout.
[00:35:49.917 --> 00:35:52.418]  The affidavit doesn't say how the standoff ended.
[00:35:53.039 --> 00:35:54.619]  No listing for Riddle and Douglas.
[00:35:54.719 --> 00:35:56.060]  Phone message left Thursday.
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.361]  Nethercutt was not returned.
[00:35:59.442 --> 00:36:11.353]  What they're doing there, and I've had people from Ranch Rescue on, and this could end up being another Waco, is they are there documenting the illegal aliens coming across.
[00:36:11.753 --> 00:36:16.097]  They're trying to protect their own property, which the Border Patrol isn't doing.
[00:36:16.838 --> 00:36:18.119]  Absolutely isn't doing.
[00:36:18.749 --> 00:36:21.691]  We have an open border with Mexico.
[00:36:21.771 --> 00:36:23.351]  They are streaming across.
[00:36:23.772 --> 00:36:46.163]  It got to a point to where the governor of Arizona put forth a proposition that maybe we could put stations in the desert so so many wouldn't die in the desert stocked with water so that the illegals... I mean, it's like taking money and sending it outside the bank and saying, maybe you'll trip on the carpeting, so let's leave the money outside the bank for you.
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:37:00.088]  And then we've even come, if someone has been in this country and worked for five years, or they're using a matricular card to say they did, we are giving Social Security to illegal aliens.
[00:37:00.468 --> 00:37:13.696]  It's going to cost, over the next 20 years, they estimate $350 billion to give Social Security to illegal, illegal, not people with a green card, not people working here legally, illegal aliens.
[00:37:14.556 --> 00:37:16.057]  We're giving them Social Security.
[00:37:16.886 --> 00:37:18.527]  Man, it just doesn't quit.
[00:37:18.747 --> 00:37:23.390]  It just simply does not quit the giveaway of America.
[00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:29.613]  I've talked to former border agents, and what's been going on there is absolutely, in my opinion, criminal.
[00:37:30.214 --> 00:37:33.295]  Talking about that, let's go to a state where I used to live in Tulsa.
[00:37:33.355 --> 00:37:35.257]  This is Carol over in Oklahoma.
[00:37:35.277 --> 00:37:35.897]  Hi, Carol.
[00:37:36.277 --> 00:37:37.038]  Hi, Erskine.
[00:37:37.078 --> 00:37:39.319]  Doing a great job for Alex while he's gone.
[00:37:39.439 --> 00:37:42.101]  Where in Oklahoma are you hailing from?
[00:37:42.161 --> 00:37:42.821]  Delaware County.
[00:37:43.875 --> 00:37:45.516]  Okay, good to talk with you.
[00:37:45.797 --> 00:37:46.157]  Thank you.
[00:37:46.197 --> 00:37:48.359]  I'm just across the line from Arkansas.
[00:37:49.239 --> 00:37:49.920]  Absolutely.
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:51.281]  Have you ever been over?
[00:37:51.361 --> 00:37:55.544]  There's a little place over there just outside Salisaw called the Wild Horse.
[00:37:57.386 --> 00:38:02.570]  No, but... Best barbecue I have ever eaten in my entire life.
[00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:04.231]  It's right outside Salisaw.
[00:38:04.251 --> 00:38:08.714]  It's called the Wild Horse, which is just a little bit west of Poteau.
[00:38:08.774 --> 00:38:11.476]  I know where it is, but I don't know where that restaurant is.
[00:38:14.308 --> 00:38:14.848]  Okay.
[00:38:16.169 --> 00:38:30.533]  What I wanted to say was we need to remember that we are a constitutional republic and that when you're voting, you're really not voting for the man.
[00:38:30.654 --> 00:38:33.995]  You're voting for electoral delegates, electoral votes.
[00:38:34.895 --> 00:38:39.636]  And the electors are the ones who will decide ultimately.
[00:38:42.391 --> 00:38:45.172]  Right, because we are a democratic republic.
[00:38:45.292 --> 00:38:47.552]  Don't forget that America is a republic.
[00:38:47.572 --> 00:39:04.516]  That's right, and there are some, and you can almost tell which way... Well, of course, our founding fathers were brilliant, and they tried to put a bunch of checks and balances into our system so that it could not be stolen from us like it is being at the moment.
[00:39:05.253 --> 00:39:11.201]  But there are people like Jesse Jackson and Hillary Clinton who want to do away with the Electoral College.
[00:39:11.261 --> 00:39:16.868]  And every once in a while you start hearing this again, this drumbeat of get rid of the Electoral College.
[00:39:16.928 --> 00:39:17.729]  It's not right.
[00:39:17.769 --> 00:39:18.770]  It's not democratic.
[00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:19.912]  Well, how could we have these people?
[00:39:19.952 --> 00:39:22.034]  Well, you know, back until 1913...
[00:39:24.344 --> 00:39:28.908]  Our senators were appointed by the governors, which was a mistake for us to go away from that.
[00:39:29.069 --> 00:39:31.691]  And some people would say, oh no, the people need to elect those.
[00:39:32.011 --> 00:39:38.418]  Well, I can say that having lived in Arkansas for a long time, we'd have been a whole lot better off having the governor appoint them.
[00:39:38.478 --> 00:39:45.184]  A lot of them were elected, I think, also not only appointed by the governor, but in certain cases they were elected by the state legislature.
[00:39:45.224 --> 00:39:45.444]  Right.
[00:39:45.544 --> 00:39:48.067]  And a lot of things happened in this country in 1913 and under the...
[00:39:49.868 --> 00:39:53.871]  Like the Federal Reserve?
[00:39:53.911 --> 00:39:54.792]  Yes, like that.
[00:39:55.252 --> 00:40:03.218]  But I just wanted to say that, like for instance, I believe in everything the Constitutional Party stands for.
[00:40:03.418 --> 00:40:04.920]  I know Howard Phillips personally.
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:05.860]  He's a fine man.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.021]  He's a brilliant man.
[00:40:07.041 --> 00:40:11.004]  He would make a great president, but he's not the one running.
[00:40:11.444 --> 00:40:14.627]  Unfortunately, they have a lawyer named Michael Peruca.
[00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:20.373]  And although he says the right things, and he says, well, I can believe in the Bible and I can do this.
[00:40:20.773 --> 00:40:23.174]  Well, the bottom line is a couple of things.
[00:40:23.994 --> 00:40:28.817]  He is a debt collector for Citibank.
[00:40:29.737 --> 00:40:35.140]  And you can call his office and verify this, but he is one of them.
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.961]  He works for the establishment.
[00:40:37.541 --> 00:40:41.463]  And how can I say this?
[00:40:44.144 --> 00:40:48.687]  The Constitution Party, number one, is not even going to be on the ballot in Oklahoma, okay?
[00:40:49.147 --> 00:40:52.029]  And they're not going to be on in seven other states.
[00:40:52.369 --> 00:40:59.033]  They're only going to be in, at best, 43 and maybe 41, which almost negates it in the first place.
[00:40:59.373 --> 00:41:02.275]  Well, you need to vote for somebody now.
[00:41:02.295 --> 00:41:03.996]  What's your choice?
[00:41:04.437 --> 00:41:11.481]  Well, the Constitution Party would have been, but I cannot in this state because he's, number one, not going to be on the ballot.
[00:41:12.145 --> 00:41:18.711]  So I have to remember, I am voting for electoral delegates, electors.
[00:41:18.951 --> 00:41:29.962]  And so then it gets down to, again, which is the way the Federal Reserve bankers who have run the cost of all the elections, running a
[00:41:30.563 --> 00:41:32.564]  Well, they've still got one going on.
[00:41:52.051 --> 00:41:56.576]  Well, they've got three commissioners per county, and Oklahoma's got like 120 counties.
[00:41:56.617 --> 00:42:00.802]  They have three per county, and they had at least two commissioners out of each county busted.
[00:42:00.882 --> 00:42:03.145]  And they had one old boy, and they came up to him and they said...
[00:42:03.869 --> 00:42:06.652]  Listen, Bubba, he said, why'd you take that money?
[00:42:06.732 --> 00:42:11.035]  He said, it was called a commissioner, and I wasn't making much, so it was just my commission.
[00:42:11.616 --> 00:42:16.080]  Well, I thought that was about the best answer I had heard in a long, long time.
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:25.568]  But vote for a third party if you have to, but if you're voting for a lawyer, you've got to look at that real questionably.
[00:42:25.668 --> 00:42:27.570]  Not down on all lawyers, but...
[00:42:27.992 --> 00:42:35.576]  Our Constitution really negates them even being holding a public office, if you understand what the C.A.R.
[00:42:35.816 --> 00:42:44.240]  is, which it gives them title, and that says that it's the British Accredited Registry, so they all belong to the bar.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:50.583]  So they have a loyalty that is outside the United States that's higher, and it is a brotherhood.
[00:42:51.043 --> 00:42:54.905]  They stick together like super glue.
[00:42:56.107 --> 00:43:04.312]  Well, you heard Alex Jones yesterday saying that they want to do away with the 22nd Amendment to where Arno could run for president.
[00:43:05.113 --> 00:43:07.374]  I think he's running right now, don't you?
[00:43:08.537 --> 00:43:10.158]  I think he is.
[00:43:10.258 --> 00:43:11.658]  I think you're exactly right.
[00:43:11.778 --> 00:43:14.899]  And, you know, it just keeps coming and coming and coming.
[00:43:14.919 --> 00:43:16.520]  They just don't stop on us.
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:20.301]  Let's go immediately to Tim in Ohio.
[00:43:20.361 --> 00:43:23.683]  Tim, welcome to the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[00:43:23.723 --> 00:43:24.923]  Thanks for holding on, Tim.
[00:43:25.343 --> 00:43:26.083]  Oh, no problem, Erskine.
[00:43:26.123 --> 00:43:26.784]  Nice to talk to you.
[00:43:27.604 --> 00:43:29.905]  I noticed you were saying a couple quick things.
[00:43:29.925 --> 00:43:31.765]  You said that it was Constitution Day.
[00:43:32.306 --> 00:43:34.286]  I've been looking around on most calendars.
[00:43:34.326 --> 00:43:35.807]  You know what it says on most calendars?
[00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:36.820]  What's that?
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.261]  Citizenship Day.
[00:43:40.002 --> 00:43:42.123]  Well, I always called it Constitution Day.
[00:43:42.523 --> 00:43:43.743]  I would prefer that than citizen.
[00:43:43.763 --> 00:43:45.664]  That sounds like what they were teaching the gray shirts.
[00:43:45.684 --> 00:43:48.505]  You know, citizen, may I see your papers at the checkpoint?
[00:43:48.565 --> 00:43:49.366]  Yes, yes.
[00:43:49.706 --> 00:43:53.367]  I'm not even sure if we have any benefits today being a citizen.
[00:43:53.748 --> 00:43:54.708]  What are our benefits?
[00:43:54.768 --> 00:43:56.969]  I mean, if you're illegal, you've got a lot of benefits.
[00:43:56.989 --> 00:43:58.249]  You've got free medical care.
[00:43:58.269 --> 00:43:59.290]  You've got free schooling.
[00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:00.510]  You've got this, that, and the other.
[00:44:00.851 --> 00:44:02.571]  But our benefits as a citizen?
[00:44:02.851 --> 00:44:03.892]  Show us your papers.
[00:44:04.512 --> 00:44:06.492]  Yeah, that seems to be our benefit.
[00:44:07.393 --> 00:44:13.134]  I wanted to turn attention, if I may, quickly to our friends down in South Suffern through the hurricane.
[00:44:13.154 --> 00:44:14.194]  Yes.
[00:44:14.434 --> 00:44:20.355]  Back when we had Hurricane Andrew, there was a... Andrew, I'm sorry, it was a Category 5 that went through Homestead.
[00:44:21.356 --> 00:44:22.356]  A woman named K.T.
[00:44:22.396 --> 00:44:25.557]  Frankovich wrote a book called Where Heavens Meet.
[00:44:25.617 --> 00:44:26.557]  Are you familiar with that?
[00:44:27.197 --> 00:44:27.797]  No, I'm not.
[00:44:29.017 --> 00:44:32.078]  It kind of puts FEMA...
[00:44:32.617 --> 00:44:35.939]  If I could read a quick quote from the book.
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:38.420]  K.T.
[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:39.661]  Frankovich was injured.
[00:44:39.701 --> 00:44:40.981]  She had a broken jaw.
[00:44:41.062 --> 00:44:42.782]  Eight teeth were knocked out of her mouth.
[00:44:42.862 --> 00:44:45.284]  She had glass embedded into her body.
[00:44:45.724 --> 00:44:48.886]  And when the FEMA people pulled up, here's what they said to her.
[00:44:48.946 --> 00:44:50.807]  Lady, do me a favor, he answered.
[00:44:51.267 --> 00:44:53.328]  Find yourself a piece of paper and a pencil.
[00:44:53.808 --> 00:44:58.851]  Write down your name and social security number next to the telephone number of your nearest living relative.
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:04.844]  Then tuck that piece of paper in your pocket so tomorrow when I find your body, I'll know who to contact.
[00:45:05.865 --> 00:45:06.326]  Oh my.
[00:45:06.846 --> 00:45:08.968]  That's what she wrote in this book called Where Heavens Meet.
[00:45:09.328 --> 00:45:15.113]  Now, also what's interesting is the official death toll from that storm was only 26 bodies.
[00:45:16.514 --> 00:45:24.020]  That was a category 5 storm where we had over 8,000 homes and over 9,000 apartments just literally destroyed.
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:28.984]  Now there was also another man that she names in her book, a Chief Petty Officer, Roy Howard,
[00:45:29.488 --> 00:45:40.091]  He was a sign down there, and he stated that he saw at least 5,000 bodies that were all rounded up and disposed of in what they called FEMA incinerators.
[00:45:43.411 --> 00:45:44.412]  Oh, I don't doubt it.
[00:45:44.812 --> 00:45:58.975]  And just this morning, the most chilling sound bite, I think, on the Conspiracy News Network, Heidi Collins was interviewing Mike Brown, the head of FEMA, and out of his mouth came the statement, FEMA
[00:45:59.935 --> 00:46:01.456]  And keep in mind what I just told you about that.
[00:46:01.816 --> 00:46:05.819]  FEMA is the face of the government for the entire nation.
[00:46:07.541 --> 00:46:12.104]  Well, it is the face of the, even President Bush said, the shadow government.
[00:46:12.184 --> 00:46:12.764]  That's scary.
[00:46:12.824 --> 00:46:14.486]  And this is exactly what's happening.
[00:46:14.546 --> 00:46:16.207]  I'll tell you what was very frightening to me.
[00:46:16.247 --> 00:46:28.696]  There's $3 billion, with a B, billion dollars offered in the last congressional budget, and this has been approved for the CLIF, Civilian Labor Inmate Force.
[00:46:29.443 --> 00:46:31.323]  This is the Roundup Places.
[00:46:31.563 --> 00:46:32.204]  They are here.
[00:46:32.464 --> 00:46:33.024]  They are here.
[00:46:33.084 --> 00:46:34.344]  Make no mistake about it.
[00:46:34.364 --> 00:46:38.065]  These are secret detention facilities and they're not really so secret.
[00:46:38.105 --> 00:46:40.365]  They are here and they're operated by FEMA.
[00:46:40.405 --> 00:46:42.546]  A couple of things, too, I noticed while I was watching.
[00:46:42.646 --> 00:46:44.766]  Also, do you ever look at how FEMA was founded?
[00:46:45.307 --> 00:46:49.808]  It was founded by presidential orders and that type of thing.
[00:46:49.848 --> 00:46:51.628]  Never voted on or anything else.
[00:46:51.868 --> 00:46:52.048]  Right.
[00:46:52.948 --> 00:46:56.029]  And it was originally called the Federal Emergency Military Authority.
[00:46:56.977 --> 00:46:57.658]  Absolutely.
[00:46:57.838 --> 00:47:01.401]  And then they said, well, I think they tested that name and it came back kind of harsh.
[00:47:01.441 --> 00:47:03.063]  And they said, well, we need to soften up.
[00:47:03.683 --> 00:47:09.709]  They do play with words, don't they?
[00:47:09.789 --> 00:47:10.229]  They sure do.
[00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:20.699]  On cops, they had a couple things there that if you look real close, they had on one show, they had a military policeman in the camouflages along with the sheriff's deputies going out on bus.
[00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:26.132]  And then in another thing, they had a CIA agent leading a drug sting here on foreign soil.
[00:47:26.172 --> 00:47:27.613]  They actually said a CIA agent.
[00:47:28.293 --> 00:47:43.480]  And they also had pictures of these gray shirts that we were talking about, where they wore the gray shirts, and the flag was in black and gray on the shirt, and the star field was over to the right, like we see on the soldiers in Iraq right now.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:48:04.133]  Now, the other thing that you need to know about, and that is when you're talking about the police, the police are now being deputized, deputized en masse as federal, I'm trying to think of the word, as U.S.
[00:48:04.293 --> 00:48:04.833]  Marshals.
[00:48:05.654 --> 00:48:08.856]  So now they are under the auspices of the Patriot Act.
[00:48:08.896 --> 00:48:10.797]  So you're losing your local police.
[00:48:10.837 --> 00:48:13.099]  They have now been deputized en masse
[00:48:13.559 --> 00:48:15.441]  We're losing it really quickly, Tim.
[00:48:40.623 --> 00:48:49.866]  My prayers out to everyone in the South that's dealing with the hurricanes, and hats off, and thumbs up, and keep persevering to all you people trying to wake up the people that are still sleeping.
[00:48:49.906 --> 00:48:51.367]  But the movement is growing.
[00:48:52.247 --> 00:48:53.308]  God bless you, Tim.
[00:48:53.668 --> 00:48:57.589]  From your mouth to God's ear, let's hope that the movement is growing that much.
[00:48:57.629 --> 00:49:02.151]  And one of the ways you can help to make it grow is by getting some of the videos.
[00:49:02.211 --> 00:49:05.912]  American Dictators, State Election 2004, Police State, 1, 2, 3, Matrix of Evil, all by...
[00:49:08.813 --> 00:49:13.955]  Alex Jones, Infowars.com, 888-803-4438.
[00:49:13.995 --> 00:49:17.497]  Don't just get these videos, but get them and duplicate them.
[00:49:17.537 --> 00:49:18.577]  Get them and show them.
[00:49:18.837 --> 00:49:19.437]  Get them out.
[00:49:19.577 --> 00:49:22.699]  Just to have the videos sitting there does no good.
[00:49:22.979 --> 00:49:25.060]  You're going to have to get those videos out.
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:28.441]  Now, when we get back, we're going to be talking with Kyla, John, and Eli.
[00:49:28.461 --> 00:49:30.162]  Let's go ahead to Kyla in Virginia.
[00:49:30.202 --> 00:49:33.463]  Kyla, welcome to the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[00:49:34.663 --> 00:49:38.324]  Erskine, I'm in Richmond, Missouri.
[00:49:39.624 --> 00:49:40.604]  Richmond, Missouri.
[00:49:40.644 --> 00:49:41.645]  Good to talk with you.
[00:49:41.745 --> 00:49:43.105]  I'm the Carla that you know.
[00:49:43.125 --> 00:49:45.105]  Oh, okay.
[00:49:46.126 --> 00:49:56.468]  Erskine, I know Alex has it on the website, but there is going to be a vote within two days, according to some folks that I know.
[00:49:56.488 --> 00:50:02.249]  I got an alert this morning that they're going to be voting in the Senate on changing that law
[00:50:02.796 --> 00:50:07.741]  To allow non-U.S.-born citizens to be president.
[00:50:08.341 --> 00:50:13.246]  Now, as Alex said, Rohrabacher in the House of Representatives is backing it.
[00:50:13.406 --> 00:50:16.108]  He's from California.
[00:50:16.729 --> 00:50:19.031]  Orrin Hatch is backing it in the Senate.
[00:50:19.812 --> 00:50:20.793]  Absolutely.
[00:50:20.833 --> 00:50:22.454]  This is what Alex was talking about.
[00:50:22.494 --> 00:50:27.199]  They want to make it clear so that Mr. Schwarzenegger can run for president.
[00:50:27.259 --> 00:50:28.400]  They want to do that.
[00:50:28.976 --> 00:50:31.777]  Now, please call in if you can.
[00:50:31.877 --> 00:50:33.278]  Everybody should call in.
[00:50:33.318 --> 00:50:42.782]  Now, I have called already, and one of my senators said that overwhelmingly people are calling in against it.
[00:50:43.522 --> 00:50:44.363]  Carla, hang on.
[00:50:44.403 --> 00:50:50.105]  Let's talk a little bit more about that, because I want all the listeners to be right up to speed on what we're talking about.
[00:50:50.445 --> 00:50:56.248]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Radio Program, www.infowars.com.
[00:51:01.693 --> 00:51:06.038]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.218 --> 00:51:10.624]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.784 --> 00:51:15.189]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.209 --> 00:51:16.571]  The New World Order.
[00:51:18.344 --> 00:51:22.569]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.629 --> 00:51:29.559]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.699 --> 00:51:31.681]  You will lose your liberty.

[00:52:01.111 --> 00:52:03.093]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[00:52:03.173 --> 00:52:13.882]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:52:14.262 --> 00:52:18.786]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:52:18.866 --> 00:52:30.195]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:52:30.775 --> 00:52:37.619]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:52:38.019 --> 00:52:40.160]  Your purified water is now ready.
[00:52:40.641 --> 00:52:45.624]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.
[00:52:45.924 --> 00:52:56.490]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[00:53:00.452 --> 00:53:02.795]  We're good to go.
[00:53:18.015 --> 00:53:18.655]  We're good to go.

[00:54:02.802 --> 00:54:05.884]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[00:54:09.452 --> 00:54:17.293]  Sneaking in there like the Pink Panther.
[00:54:17.333 --> 00:54:18.754]  Yeah, you better believe it.
[00:54:18.794 --> 00:54:19.794]  That's what they're doing.
[00:54:20.234 --> 00:54:27.875]  This is the Alex Jones Program, and this is Erskine coming at you and hopefully giving you some information that is meaningful for you.
[00:54:28.455 --> 00:54:38.577]  Now, when we're talking about the new doing away with it, how can they change the Constitution that rapidly where it's required?
[00:54:39.117 --> 00:54:41.919]  Don't you need three quarters of the states to ratify it?
[00:54:41.939 --> 00:54:44.760]  It would have to be a constitutional amendment, wouldn't it?
[00:54:57.226 --> 00:54:58.286]  I would think it would.
[00:54:58.366 --> 00:55:05.728]  If they're going to change it to where they are going to make it to where anybody can be a member, it doesn't matter.
[00:55:05.748 --> 00:55:07.509]  You don't have to be born in the United States.
[00:55:08.009 --> 00:55:12.030]  I would certainly think that would take a constitutional amendment for them to change it.
[00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:15.131]  It is something that we need to stop.
[00:55:15.171 --> 00:55:16.831]  There is no question about it.
[00:55:17.051 --> 00:55:18.351]  I have a number for that.
[00:55:18.411 --> 00:55:20.312]  It's going to be like the Olympics, Erskine.
[00:55:20.352 --> 00:55:20.992]  You'll be able to
[00:55:21.584 --> 00:55:28.065]  You know, like the Zola Bud, wasn't she from one country and went over and ran, and she was a track star and ran over in another country?
[00:55:28.085 --> 00:55:29.386]  Absolutely.
[00:55:29.406 --> 00:55:31.746]  Just like the Olympics, we'll just have, you know, Gorbachev.
[00:55:31.766 --> 00:55:35.747]  Or like Hillary Clinton running for senator in New York, huh?
[00:55:36.247 --> 00:55:37.828]  That is, I know.
[00:55:38.148 --> 00:55:44.009]  I mean, we're going to have these carpetbagging, international carpetbaggers running now.
[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:46.862]  But I want to... Here's the number, by the way.
[00:55:47.582 --> 00:55:48.763]  This is a toll-free number.
[00:55:48.783 --> 00:56:01.252]  If anyone wants to call, please call in because Jim Talent, who is the newer senator from Missouri, his people said that everybody is against it.
[00:56:01.292 --> 00:56:02.353]  There's nobody for it.
[00:56:02.813 --> 00:56:04.014]  And they're getting a lot of calls.
[00:56:05.095 --> 00:56:06.196]  So here's the number, 877... 877... 389...
[00:56:11.708 --> 00:56:17.150]  389-7321, and that will connect you to any of your representatives.
[00:56:17.590 --> 00:56:18.870]  But I wanted to say one thing.
[00:56:19.171 --> 00:56:37.997]  The woman that called up and talked about the direct election that they used to have, the reason they did away with that, nothing is perfect in this world, is because you had people like Jay Gould and wealthy industrialists flopping big fat sacks of cash on people's homes.
[00:56:38.993 --> 00:56:42.555]  There was corruption on their desks and there was corruption so they went to that.
[00:56:42.595 --> 00:56:50.118]  It may not be perfect, but the other way you had more accountability directly to your representative.
[00:56:50.178 --> 00:57:00.343]  Now it's a popular deal, but then if there is corruption, you can get them out a little faster, I think.
[00:57:01.423 --> 00:57:03.144]  Well, I haven't seen that happen too often.
[00:57:03.926 --> 00:57:08.947]  You should be able to, but it's just getting worse and worse, Erskine.
[00:57:09.007 --> 00:57:21.911]  I mean, I know I'm not going to vote for Scully or Bonesy, and so I looked at the third parties, which I voted third party, Libertarian a lot, and I voted for Buchanan.
[00:57:22.931 --> 00:57:28.332]  In fact, I ran as an alternative delegate in the Republicans, and I was a delegate for him in the Reform Party.
[00:57:28.372 --> 00:57:31.373]  But you pretty much either have
[00:57:32.152 --> 00:57:35.875]  The Constitution Party or the Libertarian Party.
[00:57:37.437 --> 00:57:43.062]  I'm one of these who worked for Ross Perot and thought he made a lot of sense when he talked about that giant sucking sound going south.
[00:57:43.602 --> 00:57:50.548]  And, you know, everybody laughed at Ross Perot, and I don't think people are laughing now as that giant sucking sound is taking all their jobs south.
[00:57:50.888 --> 00:57:51.969]  Oh, yeah, I know.
[00:57:52.129 --> 00:57:55.052]  He was right, and ten years later, look what happened.
[00:57:55.952 --> 00:57:58.574]  I want to see a bumper sticker, Perot was right.
[00:57:58.794 --> 00:58:00.955]  I'm not hearing anybody talk about that.
[00:58:01.015 --> 00:58:03.457]  Nobody's mentioning Ross Perot anymore.
[00:58:03.557 --> 00:58:08.360]  It's like he dropped off, but the man was absolutely right in what he was saying.
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:16.025]  Over here in this area, on the same station you're on, the Reform Party does have a show.
[00:58:17.006 --> 00:58:18.307]  And they do talk about it.
[00:58:18.807 --> 00:58:22.329]  I'd like to see more people on these little stations if they're allowed to.
[00:58:22.849 --> 00:58:24.210]  What station is that, Carla?
[00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:29.032]  KCXL 1140.
[00:58:29.152 --> 00:58:32.894]  Their show is on, I think it's 10 o'clock on Saturday.
[00:58:33.555 --> 00:58:37.016]  And drop me a line at Erskine on radio.com.
[00:58:37.837 --> 00:58:40.218]  Thank you, Carla.
[00:58:40.238 --> 00:58:41.939]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:51.721 --> 00:58:54.804]  Hello fu- Big Brother.
[00:58:54.844 --> 00:58:57.387]  Mainstream Media.
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:01.841]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.521 --> 00:59:03.341]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.102 --> 00:59:04.982]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.002 --> 00:59:09.464]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.844 --> 00:59:13.946]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.867 --> 00:59:15.587]  God bless him.
[00:59:15.687 --> 00:59:17.508]  Alex Jones taking a couple days off.
[00:59:17.588 --> 00:59:25.872]  And this is Erskine of Erskine Overnight, www.erskineonradio.com, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:59:27.239 --> 00:59:30.983]  As if anybody can have... I'm not trying to take the place of Alex.
[00:59:31.023 --> 00:59:32.345]  He'll be back here Monday.
[00:59:32.405 --> 00:59:34.026]  Nobody can replace Alex Jones.
[00:59:34.086 --> 00:59:40.033]  I'm just sitting in here for just keeping the seat a little bit warm for him until he gets back here Monday.
[00:59:40.899 --> 00:59:44.402]  Little thing, he's on an absolute vacation.
[00:59:44.442 --> 00:59:46.983]  You know his trip to New York was certainly no vacation.
[00:59:47.023 --> 00:59:58.612]  If you heard him, he was down there in the trenches almost getting arrested, reporting on not the 3,000 people in the convention center and all the garbage we saw on TV, but the 300,000 protesting out front.
[01:00:02.629 --> 01:00:15.096]  The 300,000 protesters, let's see, 3,000 there, they get like 99.9% of the coverage, 100,000 over here, everybody ignores them, except for Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.136 --> 01:00:16.697]  He's there with the people.
[01:00:17.037 --> 01:00:20.899]  He's understanding the heart, the pulse beat of America.
[01:00:21.219 --> 01:00:30.104]  That is the key to what makes Alex Jones such a valuable resource to this country and why they are so afraid of Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.744 --> 01:00:35.466]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, American Dictators, the staged election 2004.
[01:00:36.367 --> 01:00:38.208]  He has the courage to put out the video.
[01:00:38.788 --> 01:00:40.569]  The video concerning the police state.
[01:00:40.949 --> 01:00:44.911]  Interviewing Alex a couple of weeks ago there at the Republican Convention.
[01:00:44.951 --> 01:00:46.871]  He says, this is a police state.
[01:00:47.031 --> 01:00:48.692]  I'm sure he'll have a video out on it.
[01:00:49.032 --> 01:00:52.654]  Get the Alex Jones videos and get them out to your friends.
[01:00:53.354 --> 01:00:54.435]  Make copies of them.
[01:00:54.555 --> 01:00:55.635]  He wants it out.
[01:00:56.336 --> 01:00:59.237]  Information has to get out to the American public.
[01:01:01.141 --> 01:01:04.082]  888-803-4438.
[01:01:05.163 --> 01:01:06.123]  Give them a call.
[01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:07.044]  Get the videos.
[01:01:07.744 --> 01:01:14.006]  Well, I hope Alex is having fun on his vacation, but I've got a little quickie for you because we've got to relax a little bit.
[01:01:14.106 --> 01:01:16.347]  You know, you can't be all serious all the time.
[01:01:17.027 --> 01:01:26.911]  So this fellow decided he needed a few days off, and he was out of vacation time, so he thought, well, you know, the best way to get the boss to send me home is to act a little crazy.
[01:01:27.451 --> 01:01:28.051]  So he said,
[01:01:28.934 --> 01:01:30.115]  I'm starting to burn out.
[01:01:30.395 --> 01:01:31.757]  I really need some time off.
[01:01:31.837 --> 01:01:36.101]  So he went to work early and began hanging upside down from the ceiling.
[01:01:36.121 --> 01:01:40.245]  One of the co-workers, she came in and said, What are you doing?
[01:01:41.366 --> 01:01:43.708]  He said, I'm acting crazy to get a few days off.
[01:01:43.808 --> 01:01:44.529]  I'm a lightbulb.
[01:01:44.549 --> 01:01:48.553]  A second later, the boss walked in and said, What are you doing?
[01:01:48.773 --> 01:01:49.794]  He said, I'm a lightbulb.
[01:01:50.504 --> 01:01:51.364]  You're crazy.
[01:01:51.644 --> 01:01:52.805]  Take a few days off.
[01:01:52.905 --> 01:01:55.046]  With that, he jumped down and started walking out.
[01:01:55.306 --> 01:01:56.546]  His co-worker followed him.
[01:01:57.126 --> 01:01:58.547]  The boss said, where are you going?
[01:01:58.607 --> 01:02:01.628]  She looked up and said, I'm going with him.
[01:02:01.708 --> 01:02:02.748]  I can't work in the dark.
[01:02:03.108 --> 01:02:06.029]  Well, you see, you need a little bit of time off.
[01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:07.149]  There are ways to do it.
[01:02:07.449 --> 01:02:08.470]  Alex didn't do it that way.
[01:02:08.490 --> 01:02:12.631]  He just said, I'm going to take a couple days off, which is a better way to do it.
[01:02:13.291 --> 01:02:14.272]  You've got to relax.
[01:02:14.312 --> 01:02:17.853]  You've got to have a little bit of fun and loosen up just a little bit.
[01:02:17.913 --> 01:02:18.153]  I mean,
[01:02:18.991 --> 01:02:19.832]  Life is too short.
[01:02:19.952 --> 01:02:21.714]  None of us is going to get out of here alive.
[01:02:22.315 --> 01:02:24.757]  I really don't think any of us is going to get out of here alive.
[01:02:24.797 --> 01:02:26.860]  So have a little bit of fun while we're doing it.
[01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:29.603]  But don't forget to fight the battle.
[01:02:30.063 --> 01:02:31.625]  You have no choice.
[01:02:31.785 --> 01:02:35.109]  This is a battle for America.
[01:02:35.369 --> 01:02:38.352]  This is the battle for America that we're in.
[01:02:38.953 --> 01:02:39.914]  And it's a battle...
[01:02:40.774 --> 01:02:44.336]  Not only for America, but it's a battle of good versus evil.
[01:02:44.376 --> 01:02:47.819]  Make no mistake, we are in a battle of good versus evil.
[01:02:48.139 --> 01:02:49.380]  John in Louisiana.
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:54.463]  John, let's hope that you got in pretty good shape and you missed most of the disaster.
[01:02:54.563 --> 01:03:00.647]  And thank goodness it went a little bit to the east and missed New Orleans, or it could have been a terrible situation.
[01:03:01.128 --> 01:03:02.849]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Program.
[01:03:02.869 --> 01:03:04.670]  Good afternoon, Erskine.
[01:03:04.690 --> 01:03:05.471]  Yeah, we were blessed.
[01:03:05.511 --> 01:03:09.393]  We got nothing but wins, gusty wins, 40-50 maybe.
[01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:10.674]  Where are you in Louisiana?
[01:03:11.094 --> 01:03:12.395]  I'm north of New Lagos.
[01:03:12.715 --> 01:03:14.536]  Now, you may not know New Lagos.
[01:03:14.596 --> 01:03:22.520]  That's erstwhile New Orleans, but Lagos is the capital of Nigeria, and that place has become like the capital of Nigeria.
[01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:26.162]  So you're just a little bit north of Lake Ponsitrine, okay?
[01:03:26.182 --> 01:03:27.883]  You got it in the Piney Woods.
[01:03:28.818 --> 01:03:29.439]  I've been there.
[01:03:29.499 --> 01:03:30.019]  I've been there.
[01:03:30.039 --> 01:03:30.780]  You talk to me.
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:33.062]  I bet you've been out to Skull and that P-Row boat.
[01:03:33.603 --> 01:03:35.204]  Oh, yeah.
[01:03:36.566 --> 01:03:38.547]  That Cajun food, man, that's something.
[01:03:38.628 --> 01:03:42.431]  I have the best oysters over there.
[01:03:42.611 --> 01:03:46.155]  If it sounds like I'm always talking about food, I enjoy eating.
[01:03:46.695 --> 01:03:48.637]  I think it was called the Acme Oyster House.
[01:03:49.558 --> 01:03:51.720]  That is a wonderful place in New Orleans.
[01:03:53.465 --> 01:03:55.886]  Two nuclear powers rattle sabers over a disputed area.
[01:03:56.246 --> 01:04:00.148]  Peace in the Middle East derailed again as another wave of suicide bombers destabilized the region.
[01:04:00.569 --> 01:04:03.190]  Here at home and abroad, our own war against terror continues.
[01:04:03.490 --> 01:04:04.170]  Important news.
[01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:06.972]  The news you need is sketchy at best when it comes to the mainstream press.
[01:04:07.312 --> 01:04:13.055]  With Grundig's Yacht Boy 400 PE World Band Shortwave Radio, world news, news that affects you, will be at your fingertips.
[01:04:13.395 --> 01:04:17.317]  The Yacht Boy 400 PE is rated as the number one portable shortwave radio in the industry.
[01:04:17.657 --> 01:04:26.407]  And for no small reason when you consider ease of operation and features like over 40 station presets, both upper and lower sidebands, as well as ship-to-shore weather and aviation bands.
[01:04:26.587 --> 01:04:32.294]  The Grundig Yacht-Boy 400 PE is fully digital, comes with its own carrying case, external antenna, and a headset for private listening.
[01:04:32.594 --> 01:04:39.036]  Normally retailing for $249, the Grundig Yacht Boy 400 PE is now available from Cliff Scott Enterprises for only $149.95.

[01:04:52.441 --> 01:05:01.051]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:05:01.272 --> 01:05:12.525]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:05:12.745 --> 01:05:15.408]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:15.748 --> 01:05:22.214]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled, and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:05:22.374 --> 01:05:24.236]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:05:24.436 --> 01:05:30.462]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[01:05:30.723 --> 01:05:36.288]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[01:05:36.709 --> 01:05:40.634]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:05:41.375 --> 01:05:42.076]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:53.152 --> 01:06:00.539]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:05.544]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:06:05.784 --> 01:06:11.430]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:06:11.650 --> 01:06:16.213]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:06:16.413 --> 01:06:23.557]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:06:23.597 --> 01:06:28.079]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:06:28.279 --> 01:06:30.781]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:06:31.021 --> 01:06:36.604]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our consciousness.
[01:06:36.704 --> 01:06:40.625]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:06:40.645 --> 01:06:42.186]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:07.800]  Well, you got that one half right.
[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:14.942]  It is the GCN Radio Network, and it is the Alex Jones Radio Program, but this is Erskine sitting in just today for Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.062 --> 01:07:20.043]  Alex will be back on Monday after a well-deserved vacation.
[01:07:20.063 --> 01:07:22.043]  He didn't even have to act crazy or anything.
[01:07:22.103 --> 01:07:25.384]  They just said, go ahead, Alex, take a day off, take a vacation.
[01:07:25.764 --> 01:07:27.404]  We'll bring some clown in to work for you.
[01:07:27.444 --> 01:07:29.185]  Well, I'm the clown who's in working for him.
[01:07:29.285 --> 01:07:29.985]  No, it's fun.
[01:07:30.085 --> 01:07:31.045]  It's really great.
[01:07:31.525 --> 01:07:35.186]  And I love the callers that are calling in here.
[01:07:35.606 --> 01:07:36.887]  John in Louisiana.
[01:07:36.927 --> 01:07:38.828]  John, you got a question or a comment?
[01:07:39.368 --> 01:07:40.228]  Oh, do I ever.
[01:07:40.308 --> 01:07:41.508]  Do I ever, Erskine.
[01:07:41.588 --> 01:07:44.850]  Erskine, I'm... Go for it.
[01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:49.611]  I'm 79 years old, Erskine, and I've been a student and a reader of history for all of my adult life.
[01:07:50.011 --> 01:07:54.413]  In the last years, I've printed 10,000 pages off the Internet.
[01:07:54.773 --> 01:07:56.233]  No porn or any of that crap.
[01:07:56.293 --> 01:08:00.895]  It's only government activities I've copied for posterity.
[01:08:01.448 --> 01:08:19.317]  But I don't know where these people live that say they're living in a constitutional republic because in 71 of my 79 years, I've lived in a dictatorship that was declared on March the 9th, 1933 in a War and Emergency Powers Act.
[01:08:19.817 --> 01:08:29.282]  And so the Congress of the United States has been dysfunctional ever since that day because they voted to absolve themselves and
[01:08:29.975 --> 01:08:33.577]  And abdicate all authority and responsibility.
[01:08:33.737 --> 01:08:38.279]  And in so doing, they turned over all power to the President of the United States.
[01:08:38.719 --> 01:08:42.741]  And they, even the Congress today, cannot upset or change that.
[01:08:43.201 --> 01:08:46.122]  And so, I don't know where people live like this.
[01:08:46.202 --> 01:08:48.003]  Now, all of this is available.
[01:08:48.463 --> 01:08:50.264]  It's available free on the net.
[01:08:51.156 --> 01:09:00.638]  And I would recommend for all conscious, interested people to get on the net, and if they don't have access to it, get somebody in their family or get a friend to do it for them.
[01:09:00.658 --> 01:09:12.541]  Go down and buy a ream of paper and ask them to punch in WWW, War and Emergency Powers, or they can punch in WWW, Constitution, Fact or Fiction.
[01:09:12.941 --> 01:09:18.722]  All of this is the long-time research of Dr. Eugene Schroeder in Colorado.
[01:09:19.387 --> 01:09:22.971]  Well, not only this, John, but it seems like they've had the War Powers Act of the 1940s.
[01:09:22.991 --> 01:09:24.312]  They had one of those.
[01:09:24.332 --> 01:09:25.694]  They had another War Powers Act.
[01:09:25.714 --> 01:09:28.256]  Every time they put in a War Powers Act...
[01:09:40.388 --> 01:09:53.251]  Then it just means a little bit more of our constitutional, let's not call them freedoms, let's call them protections, are dissipating because the Constitution to me was a protection to keep the government off our backs.
[01:09:53.391 --> 01:09:54.951]  It was a protection for us.
[01:09:55.292 --> 01:10:00.993]  The freedoms were granted by God, but the Constitution protected us from the government intruding on us.
[01:10:01.953 --> 01:10:07.655]  Ever since 1933, you've got it traced back to where they really started ripping it royally.
[01:10:07.995 --> 01:10:12.277]  So today, they've been chipping more and more and more off of it, haven't they?
[01:10:12.517 --> 01:10:18.859]  Yes, there have been different declarations of emergency, too, about old Tricky Dick Nixon.
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:25.542]  But we have lived under a continuous emergency since 1933 when they set aside the Constitution.
[01:10:26.502 --> 01:10:44.890]  When they have a war on anything, then the war has almost inevitably fallen against the American people, the American public, and the corporations, the corporate controls, and like Carla was talking about, the attorneys and that type of thing, have just got us wrapped up around their little finger.
[01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:48.011]  We no longer are operating under the Constitution.
[01:10:48.071 --> 01:10:52.173]  I'm sorry, it's a document that we all love when you take your oath of office and
[01:10:52.393 --> 01:10:56.336]  To that Constitution, but we're certainly not operating under it today.
[01:10:56.396 --> 01:10:58.999]  And we haven't been, as John says, since 1933.
[01:10:59.679 --> 01:11:00.400]  Correct, John?
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:01.080]  Yes, yes.
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:08.647]  We're so dumbed down that we don't understand that Junior Bush didn't even go to Congress to get an authorization for his war.
[01:11:09.607 --> 01:11:11.389]  It's pitiful.
[01:11:11.969 --> 01:11:14.471]  But this information is so easy to get.
[01:11:14.852 --> 01:11:16.673]  But you know what?
[01:11:17.013 --> 01:11:20.736]  People won't believe it when they're exposed to it because it's so...
[01:11:21.963 --> 01:11:23.164]  It's so distressful.
[01:11:23.264 --> 01:11:24.685]  It's so revolutionary.
[01:11:25.465 --> 01:11:28.087]  It's perhaps like being told that your mother was a whore.
[01:11:28.687 --> 01:11:29.848]  It's so shocking.
[01:11:29.948 --> 01:11:31.689]  I'll tell you what my finding is.
[01:11:32.469 --> 01:11:37.573]  If you tell people about it, then by and large, as opposed to being a piano player, if you...
[01:11:40.781 --> 01:11:41.622]  Tell people about it.
[01:11:41.642 --> 01:11:43.203]  They tend to get upset with the messenger.
[01:11:43.263 --> 01:11:44.704]  Thank you so much for the call, John.
[01:11:44.724 --> 01:11:45.004]  God bless you.
[01:11:45.024 --> 01:11:47.026]  We'll show immediately to Eli in Michigan.
[01:11:47.406 --> 01:11:50.849]  Eli, welcome to the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[01:11:50.869 --> 01:11:52.230]  You are on, my friend.
[01:11:52.490 --> 01:11:52.910]  Thank you.
[01:11:53.791 --> 01:11:54.792]  And how are you today?
[01:11:55.672 --> 01:11:57.334]  I couldn't be better if I had to.
[01:11:57.394 --> 01:11:59.275]  I'm just doing good as good can be.
[01:11:59.335 --> 01:12:00.676]  It's a Friday afternoon.
[01:12:00.716 --> 01:12:01.317]  I'm looking out.
[01:12:01.337 --> 01:12:03.218]  It's bright and sunny, and I'm feeling great.
[01:12:03.258 --> 01:12:04.039]  How about yourself?
[01:12:04.179 --> 01:12:06.540]  Yeah, I really enjoy talking to you.
[01:12:07.861 --> 01:12:08.962]  You really sound great.
[01:12:09.122 --> 01:12:09.843]  I really like it.
[01:12:10.436 --> 01:12:11.178]  I like what you say.
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.263]  Back to the Constitution.
[01:12:13.664 --> 01:12:18.695]  You know, the Constitution, you were talking about, John was talking about, okay, this is Constitution Day, they say.
[01:12:19.535 --> 01:12:23.358]  Absolutely, or Citizenship Day, but I'll go with the Constitution Day.
[01:12:23.378 --> 01:12:24.218]  Yeah, I don't know what it is.
[01:12:24.278 --> 01:12:27.261]  I looked on the calendar and I didn't see anything.
[01:12:27.341 --> 01:12:28.081]  It's Friday.
[01:12:28.141 --> 01:12:28.902]  Well, okay.
[01:12:28.922 --> 01:12:30.263]  But it's the 17th.
[01:12:30.303 --> 01:12:32.044]  It's supposed to be Constitution Day.
[01:12:32.344 --> 01:12:33.045]  Oh, really?
[01:12:33.065 --> 01:12:35.086]  The calendar I got is blank.
[01:12:35.326 --> 01:12:35.626]  Okay.
[01:12:36.027 --> 01:12:37.308]  Anyway, back to that.
[01:12:37.688 --> 01:12:37.988]  Okay.
[01:12:38.048 --> 01:12:38.568]  Quit buying.
[01:12:38.608 --> 01:12:40.350]  Quit getting those calendars from the banks.
[01:12:40.410 --> 01:12:41.811]  They'll make every day blank.
[01:12:41.951 --> 01:12:42.531]  Yeah, right.
[01:12:42.711 --> 01:12:43.472]  It's from a bank.
[01:12:43.512 --> 01:12:43.872]  Right.
[01:12:43.912 --> 01:12:44.613]  You're right about that.
[01:12:45.413 --> 01:12:46.274]  Anyway, the...
[01:12:48.822 --> 01:12:56.449]  Any Constitution, when you get down to it, is only as good as the army you have to defend it and implement it.
[01:12:56.869 --> 01:13:04.056]  If you don't have that, and you rely on the court, you know, oh, let's rely on the court.
[01:13:04.076 --> 01:13:05.797]  They're going to defend the Constitution.
[01:13:06.918 --> 01:13:07.759]  When you get back to the...
[01:13:09.601 --> 01:13:12.223]  I'm not sure I agree with that.
[01:13:12.363 --> 01:13:12.724]  Oh, really?
[01:13:12.924 --> 01:13:34.720]  You talk about your army, and if you're in the military, you have to take a hold and defend the Constitution, but I think the Constitution is a document that has to be defended by the citizens, and we have abrogated that responsibility, not the army, because America's not army-ruled, so I think the citizens have the obligation.
[01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:36.301]  I don't mean an army of the state.
[01:13:36.401 --> 01:13:38.403]  I mean an army of the people, as you say.
[01:13:38.943 --> 01:13:44.205]  Oh, like it says in the Constitution, a well-qualified militia, which is every citizen?
[01:13:44.225 --> 01:13:50.507]  Yeah, an army of the people to defend their Constitution, because you cannot depend on an army of the state to defend the Constitution.
[01:13:50.747 --> 01:13:52.068]  They're always trying to tear it apart.
[01:13:52.508 --> 01:13:58.250]  When you get back to the original Constitution, what was it, year 12, 15, I think, or somewhere about there?
[01:13:59.312 --> 01:14:04.296]  When the King John was presented with the... Oh, you're talking about the Magna Carta.
[01:14:04.336 --> 01:14:09.080]  The Magna Carta is different because that's the king giving rights to the people.
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:13.904]  The difference in our Constitution is that our rights come from God, not from the king.
[01:14:13.964 --> 01:14:20.289]  Well, I mean, but getting back to the original one that was presented to the king by the nobles at the time, the nobles...
[01:14:21.509 --> 01:14:33.414]  Well, it's like we used to say, you know, Smith and Wesson beats four aces.
[01:14:33.714 --> 01:14:38.395]  Well, you've got to have something more than a corruptible court.
[01:14:38.836 --> 01:14:45.458]  The defense is an important thing because they are going to become corrupted by the whole system of government.
[01:14:45.948 --> 01:14:49.273]  And ultimately they will just tear it to pieces, as what has happened here.
[01:14:49.854 --> 01:14:55.383]  The Supreme Court has ultimately been the one behind tearing the Constitution to pieces.
[01:14:56.405 --> 01:14:57.787]  Well, who pays these people?
[01:14:58.531 --> 01:14:59.672]  Right, the corporation.
[01:15:00.493 --> 01:15:02.114]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:15:02.174 --> 01:15:03.656]  You've got to look at who gets paid.
[01:15:03.736 --> 01:15:08.460]  I had a gentleman on who wrote a book called Mouthpiece for the Mob, so he's a mob lawyer.
[01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:12.564]  And I'm looking at him, I'm talking with him, and I'm saying, so what's your beef?
[01:15:12.604 --> 01:15:14.365]  He said, so my beef is very simple.
[01:15:14.405 --> 01:15:17.168]  I walk into a court, you've got the judge who's paid by the...
[01:15:18.108 --> 01:15:19.809]  I have one other thing that John brought up there.
[01:15:19.829 --> 01:15:19.969]  Yes.
[01:15:20.069 --> 01:15:20.429]  It was March.
[01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:20.730]  He said,
[01:15:46.587 --> 01:15:47.527]  What date did he give?
[01:15:47.587 --> 01:15:48.148]  March 5th, 1933?
[01:15:48.268 --> 01:15:51.269]  He said 1933, and the date he gave was 3-9-33, the War Powers Act.
[01:15:51.289 --> 01:15:55.511]  Oh, this is dated March 5th, 1933, that Hitler came to power in Germany.
[01:15:55.911 --> 01:15:56.912]  Well, isn't that...
[01:16:09.962 --> 01:16:15.486]  Isn't that interesting how things do have... Well, you know... Now, come on, Eli.
[01:16:15.546 --> 01:16:16.707]  It's just coincidence.
[01:16:16.807 --> 01:16:17.528]  Things happen.
[01:16:17.608 --> 01:16:18.789]  It's just coincidence.
[01:16:18.849 --> 01:16:20.510]  Things just happen in the world.
[01:16:20.610 --> 01:16:23.713]  I mean, you know, it's synchronicity.
[01:16:23.753 --> 01:16:24.573]  That's what you got.
[01:16:24.633 --> 01:16:25.874]  A little synchronicity.
[01:16:26.234 --> 01:16:27.976]  Doesn't it look pretty suspicious to you?
[01:16:29.790 --> 01:16:31.372]  No, it's just secrecy.
[01:16:31.432 --> 01:16:32.513]  Things just happen.
[01:16:32.553 --> 01:16:33.294]  You know that.
[01:16:33.815 --> 01:16:36.157]  I mean, there's no great plan.
[01:16:36.498 --> 01:16:37.779]  I listen to Rush Limbaugh.
[01:16:37.799 --> 01:16:38.780]  There's no plan.
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:39.781]  There's no order.
[01:16:40.122 --> 01:16:44.747]  The CFR, they're just a bunch of guys that get around and they're just trying to help us.
[01:16:44.787 --> 01:16:47.170]  The trilateralists, they're okay.
[01:16:47.190 --> 01:16:49.032]  And Bilderbergs don't even exist.
[01:16:49.864 --> 01:16:52.385]  You know, I've listened to Limbaugh.
[01:16:52.425 --> 01:16:56.386]  There's no conspiracy involved here in that case with that conspiracy talk.
[01:16:56.426 --> 01:16:57.867]  Come on, Eli, you know that.
[01:16:58.167 --> 01:17:00.408]  They had a constitution in Germany, you know.
[01:17:00.748 --> 01:17:07.791]  And evidently Hitler ripped the constitution up in March 1933 while they were ripping the constitution up here in March 1933.
[01:17:09.912 --> 01:17:12.313]  Well, I mean, there's no relation between the U.S.
[01:17:12.413 --> 01:17:12.974]  and Germany.
[01:17:12.994 --> 01:17:15.996]  The fact that Skull and Bones is from Germany and it's in the U.S.
[01:17:16.076 --> 01:17:17.737]  and we're promoting the leaders.
[01:17:18.077 --> 01:17:21.720]  The fact that Brown Brothers Harriman supported Adolf Hitler.
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:22.961]  There's no correlation.
[01:17:23.641 --> 01:17:24.141]  Duh!
[01:17:24.322 --> 01:17:26.703]  I mean, are we really that stupid?
[01:17:28.084 --> 01:17:28.925]  We are.
[01:17:29.425 --> 01:17:30.986]  It isn't a conspiracy.
[01:17:31.126 --> 01:17:35.288]  It's a darn good business plan that's working real good for them.
[01:17:35.328 --> 01:17:37.369]  Let's not talk about conspiracies anymore.
[01:17:37.709 --> 01:17:40.551]  Let's just call it a good old-fashioned business plan.
[01:17:40.771 --> 01:17:50.216]  Getting back to the power that lies behind the Constitution, if you don't have an armed might to defend your Constitution, it's going to be torn up and you're going to go under.
[01:17:50.236 --> 01:17:51.056]  That's all there is to it.
[01:17:51.156 --> 01:17:51.736]  And you see it.
[01:17:52.076 --> 01:17:52.937]  You see it all over.
[01:17:53.527 --> 01:17:58.331]  It seemed to me that the Founding Fathers, there were very few lawyers.
[01:17:58.451 --> 01:18:02.355]  Most of them were like farmers, and they had people who were one thing and another.
[01:18:02.695 --> 01:18:04.216]  They didn't have a whole lot of lawyers.
[01:18:05.437 --> 01:18:06.498]  And that's why it's easy.
[01:18:06.558 --> 01:18:09.661]  That's why people like you and I can understand the Constitution.
[01:18:09.701 --> 01:18:13.464]  They didn't have 15 Philadelphia lawyers filling the thing out.
[01:18:13.685 --> 01:18:14.926]  It was simple enough.
[01:18:15.626 --> 01:18:17.748]  Hey, Eli, I want to thank you for the call.
[01:18:17.848 --> 01:18:18.569]  It's been fun.
[01:18:20.327 --> 01:18:24.089]  Let's go immediately to Darrell in Pennsylvania.
[01:18:24.109 --> 01:18:26.270]  Darrell, we don't have a whole lot of time, but go ahead.
[01:18:26.290 --> 01:18:27.651]  You got a comment or a question?
[01:18:27.971 --> 01:18:40.738]  Well, it sounds like we've got the break coming, but I'd like to read one quotation about American patriotism since we just had Patriot Day last September 11th, and then I'd like to say a few quick words about Alex's videos if you'd like to hold me over.
[01:18:41.955 --> 01:18:45.299]  On both of those topics, you betcha I'll hold you over, Red Ryder.
[01:18:45.339 --> 01:18:47.823]  Those are two topics that are near and dear to everybody.
[01:18:47.863 --> 01:18:52.929]  So we'll be happy to hear from you, Darrell, from Pennsylvania, right after these brief words.
[01:18:58.467 --> 01:18:59.228]  Terrorism.
[01:18:59.368 --> 01:19:00.128]  Terrorism.
[01:19:00.228 --> 01:19:01.049]  Chemical attacks.
[01:19:01.129 --> 01:19:01.809]  Dirty bombs.
[01:19:01.889 --> 01:19:02.310]  Fallout.
[01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:03.391]  Biological attacks.
[01:19:03.571 --> 01:19:04.091]  And threats.
[01:19:04.171 --> 01:19:06.293]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:19:06.553 --> 01:19:08.134]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:19:08.394 --> 01:19:10.856]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:19:11.256 --> 01:19:25.826]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:19:25.866 --> 01:19:26.187]  government.
[01:19:26.347 --> 01:19:28.168]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:19:28.528 --> 01:19:34.430]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:19:34.570 --> 01:19:39.071]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[01:19:39.311 --> 01:19:46.233]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:19:46.253 --> 01:19:48.374]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:19:59.048 --> 01:20:00.529]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:20:00.729 --> 01:20:08.051]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:20:08.372 --> 01:20:12.793]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:20:13.053 --> 01:20:22.877]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:20:23.637 --> 01:20:27.321]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[01:20:27.641 --> 01:20:30.164]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[01:20:30.444 --> 01:20:36.369]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:20:36.609 --> 01:20:38.191]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:20:38.431 --> 01:20:39.312]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:20:39.392 --> 01:20:42.395]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[01:20:42.555 --> 01:20:43.455]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[01:20:43.496 --> 01:20:43.676]  That's 800-255-1912.
[01:20:43.736 --> 01:20:46.818]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[01:20:46.838 --> 01:20:47.799]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:20:59.710 --> 01:21:01.490]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[01:21:01.991 --> 01:21:05.411]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[01:21:05.912 --> 01:21:06.592]  Let's update.
[01:21:07.092 --> 01:21:10.553]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[01:21:11.213 --> 01:21:14.934]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[01:21:15.594 --> 01:21:16.554]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[01:21:16.594 --> 01:21:18.915]  dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[01:21:19.435 --> 01:21:20.335]  Today, the U.S.
[01:21:20.355 --> 01:21:22.596]  dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[01:21:22.976 --> 01:21:24.476]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:27.062]  January of 2002, gold spot was $2.83.
[01:21:28.404 --> 01:21:33.290]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[01:21:34.271 --> 01:21:35.012]  Gold is moving.
[01:21:35.292 --> 01:21:36.454]  Equities are treading water.
[01:21:36.854 --> 01:21:39.357]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:41.402]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[01:21:41.842 --> 01:21:43.565]  Physical possession, private gold.
[01:21:43.965 --> 01:21:45.928]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[01:21:46.348 --> 01:21:48.471]  Call Midas Resources today.
[01:21:48.491 --> 01:21:51.475]  800-686-2237 Protect yourself.
[01:21:51.735 --> 01:21:52.777]  Protect your loved ones.
[01:21:53.177 --> 01:21:53.458]  Call 800-686-2237
[01:21:58.084 --> 01:21:58.304]  I think?
[01:22:12.944 --> 01:22:16.868]  ATA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:22:16.988 --> 01:22:17.428]  Fragrance?
[01:22:17.809 --> 01:22:22.593]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:22:22.713 --> 01:22:27.398]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[01:22:27.618 --> 01:22:30.181]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[01:22:30.441 --> 01:22:33.844]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:22:34.004 --> 01:22:37.508]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[01:22:37.728 --> 01:22:40.151]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[01:22:40.251 --> 01:22:41.133]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:22:41.253 --> 01:22:51.025]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.
[01:22:51.206 --> 01:22:52.527]  Call Cal Bend toll free, 1-800-340-7091.
[01:23:09.411 --> 01:23:12.773]  This is the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[01:23:12.833 --> 01:23:15.234]  Erskine sitting in just today for Alex.
[01:23:15.254 --> 01:23:18.416]  He'll be back with you Monday with his hard-hitting reports.
[01:23:18.796 --> 01:23:33.183]  Senator Barry Goldwater in his book, With No Apologies, declared, The Council on Foreign Relations is the American branch of a society which, organized in England, believes national boundaries should be obliterated and one world rule established.
[01:23:33.564 --> 01:23:36.045]  That's your Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:23:36.805 --> 01:23:39.146]  One world, no boundaries.
[01:23:39.926 --> 01:23:50.691]  The Trilateral Commission is international, intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests in seizing control of the political government of the United States.
[01:23:51.111 --> 01:24:02.195]  The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power, political, monetary, intellectual, and ecclesiastical.
[01:24:02.933 --> 01:24:04.154]  And ecclesiastical.
[01:24:04.694 --> 01:24:05.574]  Ecclesiastical.
[01:24:05.614 --> 01:24:07.015]  That's church people.
[01:24:07.995 --> 01:24:11.437]  That's from Senator Barry Goldwater, with no apologies.
[01:24:11.557 --> 01:24:15.759]  Thank you, Senator Barry M. Goldwater, a real conservative.
[01:24:16.379 --> 01:24:19.960]  Now, we're talking with our friend Daryl in Pennsylvania.
[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:21.281]  Daryl, go with it.
[01:24:21.321 --> 01:24:22.361]  You've got a couple of things.
[01:24:22.381 --> 01:24:27.524]  You want to talk about patriotism, and you want to talk about Alex's video.
[01:24:27.544 --> 01:24:29.484]  So let's go with your patriotism first.
[01:24:29.725 --> 01:24:30.365]  Here's the quote.
[01:24:31.791 --> 01:24:35.415]  And it's by F. Tupper Saucy, who's an author and a musician.
[01:24:35.575 --> 01:24:39.218]  I've had Tupper Saucy on my program, you better believe it, yes.
[01:24:39.458 --> 01:24:43.021]  And he, as you know, and I don't know if he originated this, but he used it.
[01:24:43.502 --> 01:24:47.185]  Patriotism is not loving your government.
[01:24:48.066 --> 01:24:53.831]  A patriot is one who loves his country and watches his government.
[01:24:54.284 --> 01:24:55.505]  I think that's a pretty good quote.
[01:24:55.826 --> 01:24:57.648]  I've got to say amen to that.
[01:24:57.788 --> 01:25:02.493]  Have the whole choir say a great big amen, because that's it.
[01:25:02.673 --> 01:25:05.336]  Loving your country and watching your government.
[01:25:05.376 --> 01:25:07.398]  That's the duties of a patriot.
[01:25:08.019 --> 01:25:10.602]  And here's what I wanted to say about Alex's latest videos.
[01:25:10.662 --> 01:25:12.443]  I just got American Dictators yesterday.
[01:25:12.464 --> 01:25:13.765]  I haven't had a chance to watch it yet.
[01:25:14.201 --> 01:25:15.522]  I'm sure it's great like his others.
[01:25:15.562 --> 01:25:17.903]  I've got all of his videos except for one, the capper.
[01:25:18.223 --> 01:25:39.755]  But for now, I would like to say that the three very best Alex Jones videos, in my opinion, and the ones which I've had the very best success with in waking folks up are 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror, which, by the way, documents government sponsoring and or orchestrating terroristic events,
[01:25:40.219 --> 01:25:44.463]  To bring about their own agenda, and please state free total enslavement.
[01:25:44.863 --> 01:25:54.151]  And of course, folks can also get, as you pointed out, Erskine, the great book by Paul Joseph Watson, and it is a great book, Order Out of Chaos.
[01:25:54.371 --> 01:26:08.083]  And Erskine, as a guy who's spent 26 years in the intelligence community, I'd like to say that now is the time for folks who haven't got these videos to get these super informational tools, as I call them, offered by Alex Jones.
[01:26:08.516 --> 01:26:19.468]  Before the high-tech police stayed on steroids makes things much more difficult for the alternative media, such as substituting, and as some folks have said, an Internet 2 for the current...
[01:26:20.284 --> 01:26:29.451]  Your time is running short to get these videos and get them out.
[01:26:29.491 --> 01:26:30.972]  Your time is running short.
[01:26:31.052 --> 01:26:35.576]  Get the videos, get them out, understand what's coming, what you can do about it.
[01:26:35.656 --> 01:26:40.880]  Now, in the intelligence community, as a former intelligence operative, I've got to ask you a question.
[01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:46.424]  When you're looking at this and you're looking at the nomination of a person like Porter Goss, doesn't it just make you cringe?
[01:26:46.824 --> 01:26:47.925]  It has to make you sick.
[01:26:48.066 --> 01:26:52.791]  As I believe you pointed out, I caught the replay of the show last night.
[01:26:53.512 --> 01:27:04.004]  What was it, Lee County down in Florida where him and some of his friends helped protect and coordinate and collaborate with that under-deputy or sheriff?
[01:27:04.893 --> 01:27:05.614]  Absolutely.
[01:27:05.634 --> 01:27:07.416]  And this is the man.
[01:27:07.496 --> 01:27:11.940]  And then you can look back to what he did in Nicaragua and the whole situation.
[01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:16.505]  And I had a deception that was put out by Robert Greenwald.
[01:27:16.565 --> 01:27:18.146]  I think it's a movie that's going to be hitting.
[01:27:18.206 --> 01:27:21.790]  It has former CIA people, people who've been with the agency for 20, 30 years.
[01:27:23.311 --> 01:27:24.953]  These were professional people.
[01:27:25.033 --> 01:27:27.375]  These were true Americans and true patriots.
[01:27:27.755 --> 01:27:32.339]  The CIA has totally been trashed and okay, it's got some bad situations with it.
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:37.985]  But there were some people who really cared about America who worked in the intelligence community.
[01:27:38.465 --> 01:27:40.427]  And they're telling it like it is.
[01:27:40.527 --> 01:27:46.953]  And you're watching this and you're saying, my goodness, how could the Bush people put together what they put together when they've got these
[01:27:47.722 --> 01:28:03.834]  Honorable people telling them the truth and putting together things like Colin Powell before the United Nations talking about the mobile biological weapons going through when the intelligence people, the people who analyzed those pictures said they have no pictures of it.
[01:28:03.874 --> 01:28:05.695]  They only had an artist's rendition.
[01:28:05.995 --> 01:28:08.817]  They were taking the intelligence and totally skewing it.
[01:28:09.237 --> 01:28:15.582]  If I worked for the CIA, I would probably be sick at my stomach right now watching what they did with the intelligence that I delivered.
[01:28:16.229 --> 01:28:18.451]  And I know that, Darrell, you probably feel the same way.
[01:28:18.551 --> 01:28:18.771]  Right.
[01:28:18.811 --> 01:28:20.672]  And so, again, please get Alex's videos.
[01:28:20.732 --> 01:28:21.953]  Make a bazillion copies.
[01:28:21.993 --> 01:28:22.994]  Get them out to folks.
[01:28:23.394 --> 01:28:27.597]  And go up on InfoWars.com and make copies of the great articles they've got up there.
[01:28:27.697 --> 01:28:30.099]  And thank you so much, Erskine, for the great job you're doing.
[01:28:30.119 --> 01:28:32.981]  And God bless and protect you, Erskine and Alex and Violet Jones.
[01:28:33.882 --> 01:28:34.322]  I need it.
[01:28:34.402 --> 01:28:34.822]  Thank you.
[01:28:35.103 --> 01:28:36.043]  Thank you so much.
[01:28:36.183 --> 01:28:40.266]  We'll be right back with Richard in Colorado on the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[01:28:40.546 --> 01:28:41.787]  InfoWars.com.
[01:28:41.827 --> 01:28:42.408]  Go up there.
[01:28:43.701 --> 01:28:44.642]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.102 --> 01:28:46.723]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.623 --> 01:28:50.405]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.987 --> 01:28:58.370]  Most of us have had a cafe we frequented because the service was so wonderful or the food was so great.
[01:28:58.490 --> 01:29:05.554]  The Silver Bear Cafe understands this philosophy and has incorporated these ideals into a website that offers food for thought to nourish the mind.
[01:29:05.834 --> 01:29:12.738]  Membership in the Bear consists of a large and growing group of patriots who, like you, realize there are things in this great country that need changing right away.
[01:29:12.878 --> 01:29:13.558]  We're good to go.
[01:29:30.143 --> 01:29:32.485]  How the runaway government is crushing the American dream.
[01:29:32.765 --> 01:29:34.586]  Why wars are played out across the globe.
[01:29:34.746 --> 01:29:36.667]  The fractional reserve system, etc.
[01:29:36.887 --> 01:29:39.549]  Where we're headed and what you can do to prepare yourselves.
[01:29:39.869 --> 01:29:40.970]  Knowledge is power.
[01:29:41.210 --> 01:29:46.133]  Feed your mind and feed your financial independence with a visit to silverbearcafe.com.
[01:29:46.273 --> 01:29:48.315]  That's silverbearcafe.com.
[01:29:48.475 --> 01:29:51.657]  Do it today and preserve this country's greatness for generations to come.
[01:29:53.502 --> 01:29:57.403]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:29:57.623 --> 01:30:03.064]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:30:03.344 --> 01:30:13.707]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:30:13.867 --> 01:30:18.208]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:30:18.408 --> 01:30:26.760]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:30:27.041 --> 01:30:33.370]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[01:30:33.370 --> 01:30:33.750]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:30:53.268 --> 01:30:56.950]  You've heard about PAWS from BioOx International and its Bubble Up Technology.
[01:30:57.230 --> 01:31:01.532]  But have you heard about BioOx Citrus Concentrate that also uses Bubble Up Technology?
[01:31:01.752 --> 01:31:08.676]  BioOx Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[01:31:09.076 --> 01:31:15.741]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds, your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color crams.
[01:31:16.042 --> 01:31:19.504]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with BioWalk Citrus Concentrate.
[01:31:19.524 --> 01:31:20.325]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioWalk.com.
[01:31:24.628 --> 01:31:31.770]  Bubble Up Technology is part of the reason BioOx International will guarantee you will have a cleaner and healthier home after using BioOx Citrus Concentrate.
[01:31:31.850 --> 01:31:38.532]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use BioOx Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[01:31:38.752 --> 01:31:43.413]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioOx.com.
[01:31:43.613 --> 01:31:46.134]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[01:31:46.294 --> 01:31:50.955]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use BioOx family of products.
[01:32:07.185 --> 01:32:13.608]  This is Erskine sitting in for the great Alex Jones.
[01:32:13.848 --> 01:32:18.251]  And as Darrell from Pennsylvania said, get Alex's videos.
[01:32:18.451 --> 01:32:29.857]  And he gave a listing of the videos that you really must have if you don't have 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Two Musts, and also Police State 3.
[01:32:30.257 --> 01:32:31.377]  Police State 3.
[01:32:31.457 --> 01:32:32.478]  What a video that is.
[01:32:32.658 --> 01:32:34.299]  And American Dictators, the...
[01:32:34.899 --> 01:32:36.820]  Staged election 2004.
[01:32:37.441 --> 01:32:42.464]  Go up to Infowars.com, copy off some of the articles, and show the videos around.
[01:32:42.544 --> 01:32:46.166]  Don't just get them and put them on your shelf and say, there are the videos from Alex Jones.
[01:32:46.527 --> 01:32:48.968]  Get them out and say, hey, you want to see what's really going on?
[01:32:49.088 --> 01:32:51.009]  It may shake you up, but let's watch this.
[01:32:51.390 --> 01:32:52.150]  It doesn't matter.
[01:32:52.190 --> 01:32:54.792]  This isn't a Democratic situation.
[01:32:54.992 --> 01:32:56.753]  It isn't a Republican situation.
[01:32:57.133 --> 01:32:58.774]  It's an American situation.
[01:32:58.814 --> 01:33:01.316]  We've got to either be standing up and be counted,
[01:33:02.464 --> 01:33:05.105]  Or, if you don't stand up, you'll fall for anything.
[01:33:05.125 --> 01:33:10.108]  And falling for anything is watching CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS.
[01:33:10.708 --> 01:33:11.709]  Now, what's going on?
[01:33:12.069 --> 01:33:19.072]  One of the things that I just got in, and this is an article dealing with Tom Ridge, terrorist playing to disrupt the election.
[01:33:19.132 --> 01:33:20.613]  Ridge claims, are you scared yet?
[01:33:20.833 --> 01:33:21.494]  Are you scared?
[01:33:21.514 --> 01:33:22.454]  We're going to crank it up.
[01:33:22.474 --> 01:33:23.755]  We're going to scare you a little more.
[01:33:24.435 --> 01:33:25.816]  Are we going to have an election?
[01:33:26.016 --> 01:33:30.179]  I think we are because I don't think they care which group wins or loses.
[01:33:30.539 --> 01:33:41.347]  But this also fits in with the Alex Jones interview that he did and where he got the information about the alert that the National Guard's going on November 1st.
[01:33:41.387 --> 01:33:44.929]  So here you have Mr. Ridge saying, terrorists still hope to disrupt the U.S.
[01:33:44.969 --> 01:33:52.615]  democratic process even though the presidential nominating conventions and other high-profile gatherings this summer went off without a hitch.
[01:33:54.251 --> 01:34:05.018]  Threats reporting over the last several months has been consistent, general, and credible, and indicated that Al-Qaeda networks are trying to push ahead with its plans, Ridge said.
[01:34:05.559 --> 01:34:07.600]  So he's still pushing this threat.
[01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:12.804]  Now, you remember the last threat he had right after the Democratic Convention was on four-year-old information?
[01:34:12.824 --> 01:34:12.904]  Yeah.
[01:34:13.884 --> 01:34:14.845]  He goes on to say...
[01:34:16.815 --> 01:34:31.101]  During a morning visit at the National Targeting Center in Northern Virginia, operated by the Customs and Border Protection Agency, the center secures the nation's borders and ports and keeps a focus on keeping terrorists and their weapons out of the country.
[01:34:31.501 --> 01:34:34.343]  Aren't they doing a great job securing our border with the South?
[01:34:34.583 --> 01:34:36.463]  They are doing a terrific job with that.
[01:34:36.704 --> 01:34:37.004]  Right.
[01:34:37.544 --> 01:34:43.366]  How many illegals are coming over, not only from Mexico, but from Arab countries, from other places?
[01:34:43.627 --> 01:34:44.607]  It's an open sieve.
[01:34:45.413 --> 01:34:57.125]  Currently, financial centers in northern New Jersey, New York City, and Washington are at high alert because of recent discovered reconnaissance of buildings that apparently was done by Al Qaeda in 2000 and 2001.
[01:34:57.986 --> 01:35:00.869]  Four-year-old information reconnaissance.
[01:35:01.169 --> 01:35:08.517]  They were taking pictures of casinos in Vegas, and Oscar Goodman said, come on, everybody takes pictures of casinos in Vegas.
[01:35:09.267 --> 01:35:14.449]  Okay, alert levels remain at orange for those areas, the second highest on the national five-point scale.
[01:35:14.489 --> 01:35:18.891]  Ridge said authorities review intelligence on a daily basis to determine whether to lower them.
[01:35:19.412 --> 01:35:26.615]  Speaking to the National Press Club later, he said, every day that goes by without incident gives authorities more time to make the country safer.
[01:35:27.115 --> 01:35:36.419]  Made appearances five days before the third anniversary of the September 11th attacks and a week after militants raided a Russian school in an attack that killed more than 400 people.
[01:35:37.059 --> 01:35:38.420]  Asked whether an attack could come
[01:35:39.272 --> 01:35:41.294]  So, do you want to live under a police state?
[01:35:41.314 --> 01:35:43.936]  He's saying we'll bring whatever we need to to bring here to keep you secure.
[01:36:06.064 --> 01:36:07.045]  Keep you secure?
[01:36:07.105 --> 01:36:07.345]  No.
[01:36:07.505 --> 01:36:10.087]  It has become to keep the state secure.
[01:36:10.207 --> 01:36:11.768]  It's not about your security.
[01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:22.156]  It's a war that's being declared on the American public, and they're ratcheting up the fear factor, just ratcheting it up, cranking it up, running up that old flagpole.
[01:36:22.677 --> 01:36:24.438]  Let's go to Richard in Colorado.
[01:36:24.518 --> 01:36:30.062]  Richard, welcome to the Alex Jones Radio Program, and happy Friday, Richard.
[01:36:30.162 --> 01:36:30.903]  It's Friday.
[01:36:30.983 --> 01:36:31.823]  It's a great day.
[01:36:31.843 --> 01:36:33.164]  Hey, thank you, Erskine.
[01:36:33.184 --> 01:36:33.785]  How are you doing?
[01:36:34.522 --> 01:36:36.904]  Great, wonderful, I'm happy it's Friday.
[01:36:37.164 --> 01:36:37.424]  Yeah.
[01:36:38.025 --> 01:36:47.192]  Well, I'm out of work and I don't have any transportation right now, so it just seems like... Are you one of those 1.3 million girly men that Arnold Schwarzenegger's talking about?
[01:36:47.272 --> 01:36:47.792]  Come on!
[01:36:47.932 --> 01:36:50.114]  Yes, exactly.
[01:36:50.134 --> 01:36:55.158]  Yeah, that really... Now, how does that make you feel when you hear Arnold Schwarzenegger talk about...
[01:36:55.658 --> 01:36:56.079]  Exactly.
[01:36:56.099 --> 01:36:58.801]  And these political commercials just want to make you puke.
[01:37:19.469 --> 01:37:20.851]  Yes, they do on both sides.
[01:37:20.911 --> 01:37:22.673]  They really do on both sides.
[01:37:22.693 --> 01:37:32.323]  They're not addressing... When Alex Jones is standing there with the 300,000 demonstrators, and he's there with the people, and I'm watching the rest of the press in with...
[01:37:33.084 --> 01:37:33.344]  Right.
[01:37:56.348 --> 01:38:03.832]  Well, the reason I called Erskine is I was thinking, you know, I think that there's enough American people out there that have woken up.
[01:38:04.972 --> 01:38:11.495]  My only problem is now that we've got the information, it's as plain as written on a chalkboard in front of your face.
[01:38:13.836 --> 01:38:15.157]  How do you prosecute these people?
[01:38:16.217 --> 01:38:23.921]  How do you get them out of power without it actually coming down to, you know, picking up a gun and doing the best you can to fend them off?
[01:38:25.034 --> 01:38:27.196]  I mean, you've got the foxes in the henhouse everywhere.
[01:38:27.216 --> 01:38:28.598]  You've got them in the Justice Department.
[01:38:28.618 --> 01:38:29.579]  You've got them in Congress.
[01:38:29.599 --> 01:38:31.501]  You've got them in the Executive Office.
[01:38:32.162 --> 01:38:32.762]  They're everywhere.
[01:38:33.683 --> 01:38:37.627]  They're everywhere, but there are also good people everywhere, too.
[01:38:37.788 --> 01:38:38.669]  Don't forget that.
[01:38:38.949 --> 01:38:43.654]  Well, I'd like to see these people in handcuffs being carted off to jail.
[01:38:45.174 --> 01:38:46.295]  Well, you and me both.
[01:38:46.355 --> 01:38:50.738]  When you watch them cart off Martha Stewart, and I don't think Martha Stewart's in great shape.
[01:38:50.878 --> 01:38:55.501]  I mean, they carted her off, but I didn't exactly cry big elephant tears over it.
[01:38:55.821 --> 01:39:11.472]  But then, when I'm watching people like Kenny Lay and these people, his friend Kenny Boy, and these people, and the guy with MCI who walk away with millions and millions of dollars and all the pension funds, and I'm looking at the pension funds that have been looted and the whole thing, and I'm thinking...
[01:39:11.932 --> 01:39:12.673]  What's happening?
[01:39:12.773 --> 01:39:15.074]  I'm watching what happened on 9-11.
[01:39:15.575 --> 01:39:19.758]  If we had bad intelligence, shouldn't they have fired somebody in the intelligence community?
[01:39:19.918 --> 01:39:21.759]  No, they didn't fire anybody.
[01:39:22.159 --> 01:39:23.420]  I'm looking at this happening.
[01:39:23.460 --> 01:39:25.902]  I'm thinking, we've got some serious problems.
[01:39:26.062 --> 01:39:27.023]  I don't know the answer.
[01:39:27.443 --> 01:39:28.764]  I don't know the answer, Richard.
[01:39:28.804 --> 01:39:34.348]  I wish I could give you an answer, but I'm sitting here, as a lot of Americans are today, wondering.
[01:39:35.245 --> 01:39:37.427]  Isn't anybody accountable anymore?
[01:39:37.647 --> 01:39:38.287]  Exactly.
[01:39:38.567 --> 01:39:39.608]  Well, that's what I'm saying.
[01:39:39.888 --> 01:39:50.816]  They have engraved themselves so deep into this corrupt system that, you know, what they'll do is they'll get a patsy to take the fall for them, and that's just all for show anyway.
[01:39:51.757 --> 01:39:57.921]  And if you did have somebody in a position of power that could do something about it, you'd probably be assassinated.
[01:39:58.061 --> 01:40:00.463]  I mean, if you don't play ball with the big boys, that's what happens.
[01:40:01.463 --> 01:40:02.864]  So it's kind of scary, actually.
[01:40:02.924 --> 01:40:03.845]  I do feel powerless.
[01:40:04.947 --> 01:40:07.628]  It's very scary, and a lot of us feel the same way.
[01:40:07.928 --> 01:40:13.351]  A lot of us feel the same way, and you're expressing the same words for a lot of people.
[01:40:13.371 --> 01:40:16.992]  If anyone has an answer to Richard's question, what are we going to do?
[01:40:17.453 --> 01:40:19.513]  We're understanding who's in power.
[01:40:19.754 --> 01:40:21.374]  They're going to fall by their own weight.
[01:40:21.414 --> 01:40:22.635]  There are two things that happen.
[01:40:22.675 --> 01:40:30.938]  First, they're going to fall by their own weight, and the second thing that's going to happen, I've always noticed, and this is kind of a country expression, that snakes eat each other.
[01:40:31.339 --> 01:40:33.640]  They're going after each other when all is said and done.
[01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:34.260]  You know that.
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:34.800]  Yeah.
[01:40:35.761 --> 01:40:49.346]  And another thing to do is, you know how they say that a lot of people are waking up and then, like what happened in New York, the protesters are kept off to the side, pinned up in cages practically, away from all the action.
[01:40:49.686 --> 01:40:52.487]  With no news unless you're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:40:52.847 --> 01:40:58.289]  Yeah, well, the thing of it is, though, is it's not because the establishment is afraid of us.
[01:40:58.369 --> 01:41:01.871]  It's just that every time we put a bump in their road...
[01:41:02.901 --> 01:41:04.522]  They just up their power a little bit.
[01:41:05.703 --> 01:41:08.845]  So I don't think it's... They're arrogant.
[01:41:08.885 --> 01:41:09.825]  They're not afraid of us.
[01:41:10.025 --> 01:41:13.347]  They're going to say, every time we make a step forward, they take two steps forward.
[01:41:14.288 --> 01:41:17.730]  It sort of seems like that, and the fear factor that they keep ratcheting up.
[01:41:18.570 --> 01:41:20.631]  And then you've got what they want to do.
[01:41:20.692 --> 01:41:22.993]  A lot of the American public want to shoot the messenger.
[01:41:23.733 --> 01:41:24.234]  Exactly.
[01:41:24.734 --> 01:41:25.795]  I've had that happen to me.
[01:41:27.075 --> 01:41:27.936]  I know, Richard.
[01:41:28.056 --> 01:41:31.558]  I'm telling you, I wish I had a good answer for you, but I'm not going to...
[01:41:32.825 --> 01:41:34.606]  This ain't Dr. Laura you're talking to.
[01:41:34.626 --> 01:41:40.830]  I'm not going to flip you out some little answer and say, here it is, this is it, have yourself, have a nice day, and I'm my children tomorrow.
[01:41:40.890 --> 01:41:42.631]  I just can't do that, Richard.
[01:41:42.651 --> 01:41:47.933]  Yeah, I just wanted to bring that point up to the American listening public out there that's listening to this program.
[01:41:48.514 --> 01:41:53.256]  Like you say, if anybody out there, that's where I think we've got to start focusing our efforts.
[01:41:53.396 --> 01:41:54.397]  I mean, people know.
[01:41:54.577 --> 01:41:56.498]  They know that this country's gone down the tubes.
[01:41:57.238 --> 01:41:58.279]  Now what are we going to do about it?
[01:42:00.242 --> 01:42:02.964]  I think we're going to have to start taking care of our own family.
[01:42:03.004 --> 01:42:10.128]  I think we're going to have to realize the situation that if they start coming for you that you aren't going to blindly follow.
[01:42:10.229 --> 01:42:24.258]  I think we're going to have to make preparations to take care of ourselves if it takes moving maybe to a different place and situation and not be herded along with the rest of the group because they are putting up the detention centers.
[01:42:24.298 --> 01:42:26.319]  You've heard that and the whole situation.
[01:42:26.339 --> 01:42:26.459]  Right.
[01:42:26.659 --> 01:42:26.979]  I know.
[01:42:27.099 --> 01:42:34.564]  And when somebody comes to you and says, I'm from the government, I'm here to help you, you look at them and say, yeah, right, okay.
[01:42:35.645 --> 01:42:39.367]  So at least we are a little bit more aware.
[01:42:39.587 --> 01:42:47.952]  And you and I both know that when this whole thing falls, I don't want to be a bush, and I certainly don't want to be a member of any of these groups.
[01:42:48.292 --> 01:42:52.275]  Trilateralists or any of these sort of things when the final judgment day comes.
[01:42:52.375 --> 01:42:53.716]  I'll tell you that right now.
[01:42:53.876 --> 01:42:59.559]  These people are anti-God and they are purely evil.
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:03.622]  I know Alex has a video called The Matrix of Evil.
[01:43:04.382 --> 01:43:07.504]  Don't discount the fact that these people are evil.
[01:43:07.664 --> 01:43:15.449]  In the long run, they're not going to win, but it doesn't mean we're not going to suffer and we're not going to have a lot of fighting to do to make it through, Richard.
[01:43:15.785 --> 01:43:20.308]  That's why I think it is actually going to have to take the second coming of Christ to get this all squared away.
[01:43:21.208 --> 01:43:26.271]  I don't think people out in the streets with their guns or whatever protesting, I don't think that's going to cut it.
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:40.664]  I don't think that's going to cut it, but there's no question that we're going to have to have some divine intervention, because when you look at it, and I hear these politicians say, God bless America, I just have to say, why?
[01:43:40.804 --> 01:43:49.546]  When I look at what's happened in the schools, and you're watching what's going on on TV, the filth that's coming out, and you have to say, they're taking God out of everything.
[01:43:50.306 --> 01:43:52.227]  I'm not a religious fanatic, Richard.
[01:43:52.267 --> 01:43:53.107]  I'm really not.
[01:43:53.607 --> 01:44:00.891]  But you're looking at it and you're looking at all the principles we grew up under and you're thinking, what has American culture got anymore?
[01:44:01.451 --> 01:44:02.252]  The Osbournes?
[01:44:02.612 --> 01:44:08.795]  Yeah, because I'm 55 years old and I can remember when life was a lot more simpler, a lot more easier, carefree.
[01:44:09.356 --> 01:44:11.657]  You felt like you were proud to be an American, to be living in the
[01:44:12.691 --> 01:44:14.813]  Yeah, you can trust one another.
[01:44:14.833 --> 01:44:16.615]  You go out and you talk to one another.
[01:44:16.815 --> 01:44:21.580]  And I remember, you don't have to go that far back, I remember listening to speeches.
[01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:24.663]  He may not have been the greatest president, or he may have been a great president.
[01:44:24.683 --> 01:44:29.749]  We can debate that, but when Ronald Reagan gave a speech, you felt really proud to be an American.
[01:44:29.849 --> 01:44:30.670]  Right, right.
[01:44:31.490 --> 01:44:31.891]  I hear you.
[01:44:32.742 --> 01:44:33.702]  I haven't felt proud.
[01:44:34.022 --> 01:44:35.623]  Look at William Jefferson Clinton.
[01:44:36.063 --> 01:44:38.404]  Bush has made Clinton look good.
[01:44:39.004 --> 01:44:40.785]  Boy, I didn't think I'd ever see that.
[01:44:40.845 --> 01:44:44.206]  I thought Clinton was the biggest reprobate that we'd ever had.
[01:44:44.306 --> 01:44:49.288]  And then Bush comes along, and he actually makes Clinton look like a good president.
[01:44:49.328 --> 01:44:50.908]  I'm going, I don't know.
[01:44:50.928 --> 01:44:53.489]  They're really good at covering their own tracks, is what it is.
[01:44:53.629 --> 01:44:56.530]  The farther they go, the better they get at it.
[01:44:57.452 --> 01:44:58.053]  They do.
[01:44:58.453 --> 01:45:02.396]  Richard, thanks so much for the call, and lots of luck to your endeavors.
[01:45:02.416 --> 01:45:04.658]  You just keep fighting the fight.
[01:45:04.698 --> 01:45:06.019]  That's all we can do.
[01:45:06.399 --> 01:45:07.080]  We've got to.
[01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:08.021]  We can't give up.
[01:45:08.081 --> 01:45:08.661]  You know that.
[01:45:08.821 --> 01:45:09.562]  I know that, Erskine.
[01:45:09.602 --> 01:45:12.064]  Hey, you have a great weekend, and same for Alex.
[01:45:12.845 --> 01:45:15.367]  You too, and let's hope he's having a great vacation.
[01:45:15.787 --> 01:45:17.849]  Let's go to Malta, our friend in Denmark.
[01:45:17.889 --> 01:45:18.469]  Hi, Malta.
[01:45:18.549 --> 01:45:19.270]  How are you doing?
[01:45:20.151 --> 01:45:20.511]  Hello.
[01:45:21.452 --> 01:45:22.052]  Hi, Malta.
[01:45:22.112 --> 01:45:24.394]  Listen to me in favor on Saturday night.
[01:45:24.434 --> 01:45:25.435]  Listen to my program.
[01:45:26.712 --> 01:45:28.573]  I want to make some comments.
[01:45:29.414 --> 01:45:30.594]  Certainly, go for it.
[01:45:31.175 --> 01:45:39.779]  The first one is that even if they change the Constitution, you have to be raw bloodline if you want to be elected.
[01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:44.261]  No ordinary immigrant can be president.
[01:45:45.442 --> 01:45:48.844]  I think that's something most Americans have to know that.
[01:45:52.086 --> 01:45:56.269]  I don't think Jimmy Carter was royal bloodline.
[01:45:56.349 --> 01:45:58.490]  I think he had a number of presidents who weren't.
[01:45:59.111 --> 01:46:07.737]  You should read a book called The Thirteen Families of Illuminati by Fritz Springmeier.
[01:46:08.777 --> 01:46:09.578]  It's a very good book.
[01:46:11.051 --> 01:46:13.172]  Okay, so maybe even a lot of them have been.
[01:46:13.252 --> 01:46:27.021]  I know that it does seem rather strange, like we were talking earlier, I think it was Tim who was bringing this up, or John, and we were talking about coincidences, and the strange coincidences, 1933, Hitler comes to power, 1933, four days later we have this act.
[01:46:32.664 --> 01:46:38.748]  And the other strange coincidence that we just happen to have two skull and bones people running for president.
[01:46:38.788 --> 01:46:40.889]  That's just a coincidence, isn't it, Mosa?
[01:46:40.909 --> 01:46:42.971]  Well, I think Kerry will win.
[01:46:42.991 --> 01:46:48.554]  I understand his blue bloodline is going far more than Bush's.
[01:46:49.395 --> 01:46:50.816]  He's more blue than Bush?
[01:46:51.156 --> 01:46:53.017]  Yeah, he's more blue than Bush.
[01:46:53.037 --> 01:46:56.239]  He's even related to the shame of Iran, Kerry.
[01:46:58.621 --> 01:47:00.562]  Well, that would certainly do it, wouldn't it?
[01:47:01.246 --> 01:47:07.591]  You're talking about good guys in the FBI and the CIA.
[01:47:07.651 --> 01:47:10.353]  There are some good people who are working in the FBI.
[01:47:10.413 --> 01:47:14.737]  There are some good people, some good patriotic Americans who work for the CIA.
[01:47:15.177 --> 01:47:17.779]  Do you know a guy named Mark Phillips?
[01:47:19.180 --> 01:47:20.221]  I've heard the name, yes.
[01:47:20.241 --> 01:47:24.044]  There's a new book out called The Reason of National Security.
[01:47:24.584 --> 01:47:25.505]  It's their second book.
[01:47:26.566 --> 01:47:27.667]  He's a good guy, I think.
[01:47:28.982 --> 01:47:30.802]  Well, there have been a lot of good people.
[01:47:30.842 --> 01:47:36.784]  We're going to have Ted Gunderson on my program Saturday night, former director of the Los Angeles office of the FBI.
[01:47:37.044 --> 01:47:41.085]  He's a very good man who is speaking out and talking about what's going on.
[01:47:41.445 --> 01:47:45.326]  That will be on at, let's see, that will be 1 a.m.
[01:47:45.466 --> 01:47:48.026]  Eastern Time or 10 p.m.
[01:47:48.126 --> 01:47:48.926]  Pacific Time.
[01:47:49.046 --> 01:47:51.307]  It's 6 o'clock in the morning.
[01:47:52.387 --> 01:47:52.687]  Pardon?
[01:47:52.707 --> 01:47:55.948]  6 o'clock in the morning over here when you're in the air.
[01:47:57.472 --> 01:47:59.873]  Well, try to catch it.
[01:47:59.893 --> 01:48:05.395]  Try to go early to bed and try to find... Can I listen to it right from your website?
[01:48:06.475 --> 01:48:11.397]  Right from the website or you can go to GCNlive.com and you can get it right there.
[01:48:11.477 --> 01:48:21.521]  Erskineonradio.com Erskineonradio.com E-R-S-K-I-N-E onradio.com And you'll find all the people who are going to be on and
[01:48:22.217 --> 01:48:23.378]  We have some fun things.
[01:48:23.398 --> 01:48:33.802]  We have Daisy the Desert Dog who does football picks and lots of fun things but we also have people like Ted Gunderson and first hour we talk about the hidden causes of a heart attack which is very good.
[01:48:33.882 --> 01:48:38.204]  Half a million women in America are having heart attacks and they're not doing anything about it.
[01:48:39.505 --> 01:48:46.808]  Another thing and I go I want to say about this he says about it in 1933 it really was 1868 when they changed they make
[01:48:50.754 --> 01:48:56.484]  They make us all, they take away the American citizenship and they gave us United States citizens.
[01:48:57.405 --> 01:48:59.990]  It's the 14th dimension where they gave the right to the blacks.
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:05.082]  They take away the rights and you have to keep the licensure and license.
[01:49:05.423 --> 01:49:09.365]  You should try to get Jordan Maxwell into your show some day.
[01:49:09.845 --> 01:49:10.766]  He's a very good guy.
[01:49:11.286 --> 01:49:11.826]  I've met him.
[01:49:11.846 --> 01:49:14.047]  Yeah, I know Jordan Maxwell.
[01:49:14.608 --> 01:49:16.829]  And he has an Ukrainian friend.
[01:49:17.349 --> 01:49:17.929]  I've met him.
[01:49:18.350 --> 01:49:19.310]  He's a very nice guy.
[01:49:19.330 --> 01:49:23.032]  He's very good on secret laws in America.
[01:49:23.973 --> 01:49:26.654]  Maxwell, yeah, I know him.
[01:49:26.774 --> 01:49:27.575]  His name is Wick.
[01:49:28.555 --> 01:49:29.996]  Berian or something like that.
[01:49:31.529 --> 01:49:32.390]  I'll talk with him.
[01:49:32.450 --> 01:49:42.556]  Mosa, thank you so much for the call, and we'll be right back with Al in California on the Alex Jones Radio Program, www.infowars.com.
[01:49:53.587 --> 01:49:57.934]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.114 --> 01:50:02.462]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:14.469]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.530 --> 01:50:21.477]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.578 --> 01:50:23.600]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:34.402]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.562 --> 01:50:40.003]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:50:53.283 --> 01:50:54.904]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:55.044 --> 01:50:59.147]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:50:59.287 --> 01:51:02.169]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:51:02.249 --> 01:51:08.954]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:51:09.154 --> 01:51:12.156]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:51:12.356 --> 01:51:14.737]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:51:14.858 --> 01:51:22.983]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as at
[01:51:23.063 --> 01:51:24.644]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.

[01:52:55.893 --> 01:53:01.916]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:02.517 --> 01:53:05.499]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:07.518 --> 01:53:11.581]  This is the Alex Jones Radio Network and we on GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:11.661 --> 01:53:15.383]  It's Alex Jones Show and Erskine sitting in for Alex just today.
[01:53:15.423 --> 01:53:16.404]  He'll be back Monday.
[01:53:16.424 --> 01:53:17.764]  Don't you fear.
[01:53:18.185 --> 01:53:21.587]  He'll be back Monday with all the news and everything going on.
[01:53:22.107 --> 01:53:26.390]  Alex is taking a brief vacation that we know he needs.
[01:53:26.590 --> 01:53:30.192]  We know he needs after the time he had in New York.
[01:53:30.232 --> 01:53:31.893]  That was anything but a vacation.
[01:53:31.993 --> 01:53:35.315]  What a remarkable report that Alex gave us from New York.
[01:53:36.147 --> 01:53:40.269]  And be sure to go up to Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:53:40.329 --> 01:53:46.431]  Be sure to try to get, if you haven't, the new video, American Dictators Staged Election 2004.
[01:53:47.592 --> 01:53:49.493]  Staged Election 2004.
[01:53:50.573 --> 01:53:54.955]  And as our friend Daryl said, be sure and get Police State 3.
[01:53:56.232 --> 01:53:58.255]  He recommends three of Alex's videos.
[01:53:58.315 --> 01:54:03.403]  Masters of Terror, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, and Police State 3.
[01:54:04.124 --> 01:54:06.808]  Those are videos to not only get.
[01:54:07.469 --> 01:54:08.571]  Getting them is alright.
[01:54:08.611 --> 01:54:10.053]  You need to get these videos.
[01:54:10.433 --> 01:54:11.775]  But show them to people!
[01:54:12.496 --> 01:54:13.737]  Make copies of them.
[01:54:13.857 --> 01:54:14.478]  Get it out.
[01:54:14.618 --> 01:54:15.838]  Get it distributed.
[01:54:16.259 --> 01:54:20.061]  I've got a friend up here who has really done that.
[01:54:20.241 --> 01:54:24.704]  Bruce, he probably makes about 40 copies of every video and hands them out.
[01:54:25.004 --> 01:54:26.145]  The guy sells hot dogs.
[01:54:26.425 --> 01:54:27.146]  People come by.
[01:54:27.186 --> 01:54:29.607]  He says, hey, let's talk about this.
[01:54:29.888 --> 01:54:31.409]  He's affecting a lot of people.
[01:54:31.629 --> 01:54:35.231]  It doesn't take much word of mouth to affect a lot of people.
[01:54:35.291 --> 01:54:38.053]  People who are not interested, that's okay.
[01:54:38.133 --> 01:54:40.815]  Maybe have them over the house, show them something, ask them what they think.
[01:54:41.633 --> 01:54:44.255]  But not everybody's going to care.
[01:54:44.275 --> 01:54:48.539]  A lot of people are just running so scared in America today.
[01:54:49.299 --> 01:54:49.840]  With reason.
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:51.761]  Let's go to Phil in the UK.
[01:54:52.081 --> 01:54:53.723]  Phil, thanks for calling from England.
[01:54:53.943 --> 01:54:56.225]  And from Wales, actually.
[01:54:56.485 --> 01:54:57.706]  Home of Tom Jones.
[01:54:58.166 --> 01:54:59.107]  You've got a comment.
[01:54:59.907 --> 01:55:02.870]  Yeah, I'd like to answer Richard's question, yeah?
[01:55:03.710 --> 01:55:03.991]  Yes, please.
[01:55:04.031 --> 01:55:05.052]  How do you get rid of him?
[01:55:05.372 --> 01:55:05.612]  Yeah?
[01:55:06.312 --> 01:55:06.593]  Yes.
[01:55:07.013 --> 01:55:07.213]  Right.
[01:55:07.233 --> 01:55:07.373]  It's...
[01:55:08.556 --> 01:55:25.460]  Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the Constitution say that the President, Vice President, and all civil officers of the United States shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors, yeah?
[01:55:26.721 --> 01:55:30.282]  Well, Phil, it does say that, Phil, but then you've got...
[01:55:31.687 --> 01:55:37.390]  Members of the... It becomes political in there and they simply are not going to remove them from office.
[01:55:37.730 --> 01:55:42.952]  Yeah, but the Constitution details your God-given rights to freedom, yeah?
[01:55:44.333 --> 01:55:45.974]  Absolutely.
[01:55:46.034 --> 01:55:52.037]  We know the American government, plus members of other governments, are known Satanists, yeah?
[01:55:53.037 --> 01:55:53.958]  Absolutely.
[01:55:53.998 --> 01:55:55.758]  This boils down to the definition of state.
[01:55:55.778 --> 01:55:56.799]  The definition of state...
[01:55:57.726 --> 01:56:02.209]  Actually says, a group of ideals created by a group of like-minded people.
[01:56:02.229 --> 01:56:09.254]  Now, they've obviously been stating this and not representative of the law of state as defined in the Constitution.
[01:56:11.590 --> 01:56:11.850]  Yeah.
[01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.310]  Right.
[01:56:12.631 --> 01:56:14.752]  And I can thoroughly agree with you.
[01:56:14.772 --> 01:56:17.874]  But try to bring that up and see if you can get any action from that.
[01:56:17.994 --> 01:56:26.179]  You simply aren't because you've got a bunch of Congress people who are just generally, you can call them Congress sheeple.
[01:56:26.219 --> 01:56:27.700]  They aren't going to do anything.
[01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:32.343]  I mean, your congressman has two ends, a sitting end and a thinking end.
[01:56:32.363 --> 01:56:35.084]  His whole job depends upon his seat.
[01:56:35.184 --> 01:56:37.806]  So you're not going to get them doing a lot of thinking about that.
[01:56:38.186 --> 01:56:41.727]  They don't want it because they're all playing dirty ball up there.
[01:56:41.787 --> 01:56:42.627]  Most of them are.
[01:56:43.727 --> 01:56:45.708]  Yeah.
[01:56:45.988 --> 01:56:52.549]  So it's a wonderful concept, and eventually it's going to come to that, but it certainly isn't right now.
[01:56:52.969 --> 01:56:59.831]  The situation has gotten so bad that the United States and your country, people are hated the world over right now.
[01:57:01.124 --> 01:57:03.206]  Yeah, we know the revolution.
[01:57:03.426 --> 01:57:06.188]  And listen, Phil, we are not the government.
[01:57:06.368 --> 01:57:11.892]  I mean, Abraham Lincoln also said, a government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish.
[01:57:12.493 --> 01:57:16.796]  We are no longer a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.
[01:57:16.856 --> 01:57:18.237]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:57:18.477 --> 01:57:21.360]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:24.282]  www.infowars.com
[01:57:49.891 --> 01:57:50.512]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.192 --> 01:57:52.214]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.955 --> 01:57:54.056]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.717 --> 01:57:55.538]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.319 --> 01:57:57.321]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.881 --> 01:58:01.546]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.047 --> 01:58:06.132]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.404 --> 01:58:26.438]  This is Erskine sitting in, just sitting in, not substituting for, there is no substitute for Alex Jones, just sitting in for Alex Jones on this wonderful Friday afternoon for most of America, Friday morning if you're in the Pacific time zone, and listening around the world, well, whatever time it is there.
[01:58:26.558 --> 01:58:31.682]  I don't do well on keeping up with time, so I have trouble going daylight savings time and that type of thing.
[01:58:32.402 --> 01:58:35.925]  So my website is ErskineOnRadio.com.
[01:58:37.173 --> 01:58:38.914]  Do a program on Saturday nights.
[01:58:39.714 --> 01:58:41.675]  Starts at midnight in the East Coast.
[01:58:41.955 --> 01:58:43.456]  Nine o'clock on the West Coast.
[01:58:44.077 --> 01:58:48.319]  And this week we're going to be talking with Christian Wild and the hidden causes of heart attacks.
[01:58:49.019 --> 01:58:50.080]  Oh man, this is something.
[01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:52.241]  Half a million women a year in the U.S.
[01:58:52.281 --> 01:58:53.101]  have heart attacks.
[01:58:53.461 --> 01:58:54.362]  Much less the men.
[01:58:54.862 --> 01:58:57.043]  And the hidden causes of heart attacks.
[01:58:57.123 --> 01:58:58.744]  And it ain't your cholesterol.
[01:58:59.324 --> 01:59:01.365]  They're all doing this push on this cholesterol.
[01:59:01.405 --> 01:59:02.466]  It's not your cholesterol.
[01:59:02.526 --> 01:59:06.188]  Over half the people with perfect cholesterol are dropping over with heart attacks.
[01:59:06.866 --> 01:59:07.687]  Perfect cholesterol.
[01:59:07.707 --> 01:59:10.748]  You can walk right out of the doctor's office, be perfect, and boom, that's it.
[01:59:10.789 --> 01:59:12.430]  You're seeing them angels.
[01:59:13.030 --> 01:59:17.293]  The other guest that we're going to have is Ted Gunderson this Saturday.
[01:59:17.333 --> 01:59:19.294]  And Ted is the former...
[01:59:20.151 --> 01:59:21.012]  We're good to go.
[01:59:47.649 --> 01:59:55.333]  And tell me, or if you've got a guest you'd like me to have on the program, or something, hey Erskine, you're not talking about such and such, just drop me a note.
[01:59:55.373 --> 01:59:57.154]  I'll be happy to correspond back with you.
[01:59:57.834 --> 02:00:04.317]  So, Alex Jones has available at Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, the videos.
[02:00:05.149 --> 02:00:09.172]  American Dictators, stage selection 2004, Police State 3.
[02:00:09.492 --> 02:00:11.033]  You've heard people talking about it.
[02:00:11.133 --> 02:00:16.756]  If you don't have it, you're making a big mistake, and you've got to get them out and make copies and show them to everyone.
[02:00:17.076 --> 02:00:20.498]  We've got to get the information out while you can.
[02:00:21.239 --> 02:00:24.421]  Time is getting short, ladies and gentlemen, while you can.
[02:00:25.001 --> 02:00:30.284]  The newest report, well, we'll talk about that later, because I want to get to a bike in Florida.
[02:00:30.304 --> 02:00:31.085]  He's been holding on.
[02:00:31.525 --> 02:00:33.606]  Mike, welcome to the Alex Jones Program.
[02:00:33.666 --> 02:00:34.007]  Hi, Erskine.
[02:00:34.067 --> 02:00:34.667]  How are you doing?
[02:00:35.336 --> 02:00:36.337]  I'm doing fine, Mike.
[02:00:36.397 --> 02:00:38.118]  I wanted to get you on just as soon as I could.
[02:00:38.178 --> 02:00:39.419]  I'm sorry about the delay.
[02:00:39.479 --> 02:00:40.720]  It's good to have you with us.
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:41.541]  That's no problem.
[02:00:41.621 --> 02:00:45.163]  Erskine, while we're taking this time, I just want everybody to Google a name for me.
[02:00:45.203 --> 02:00:46.424]  Just Google just one name.
[02:00:47.525 --> 02:00:49.046]  Name is Margie Schudinger.
[02:00:49.546 --> 02:00:54.950]  Margie S-C-H-O-E-D-I-N-G-E-R.
[02:00:55.491 --> 02:00:57.132]  And the reason why I'm asking that...
[02:00:58.454 --> 02:01:09.361]  Is that I was looking that name up and I find that this woman filed a $50 million rape lawsuit against George W. Bush in December of 2002.
[02:01:10.602 --> 02:01:12.123]  Have you ever heard of anything like that?
[02:01:13.504 --> 02:01:13.844]  No.
[02:01:14.505 --> 02:01:22.270]  Well, this happened apparently after she first complained that she was being harassed.
[02:01:23.351 --> 02:01:28.174]  And apparently this $50 million lawsuit went through and I checked.
[02:01:28.715 --> 02:01:29.435]  It is legal.
[02:01:29.515 --> 02:01:30.336]  It is official.
[02:01:31.096 --> 02:01:32.357]  It was filed in December of 2002.
[02:01:32.457 --> 02:01:36.959]  This has not been on the media.
[02:01:37.559 --> 02:01:38.940]  No one has reported this.
[02:01:39.380 --> 02:01:42.982]  I had to get this from the internet from about five different sources.
[02:01:44.803 --> 02:01:46.344]  It is official.
[02:01:47.444 --> 02:01:48.705]  I saw the paperwork myself.
[02:01:49.733 --> 02:01:53.814]  Boy, that sounds like something out of Bill Clinton's playbook.
[02:01:53.874 --> 02:02:17.161]  And then you're hearing about this, and I'm listening to this sort of thing, and the cocaine use, and the whole thing, and then I'm looking at it, and I'm saying, how can those people who consider themselves to be Christian, and this is a big group that Mr. Bush is appealing to, the so-called Christian, right Christians, or Christian minority, majority, or whatever they call it, and
[02:02:17.941 --> 02:02:19.342]  How can they support this man?
[02:02:19.622 --> 02:02:20.642]  I don't understand it.
[02:02:20.662 --> 02:02:25.644]  How can they support a skull and bones man who's accepted Satan as his Lord?
[02:02:25.704 --> 02:02:26.505]  How can they do that?
[02:02:26.665 --> 02:02:30.206]  I want to talk with you some more, if you don't mind, Mike, when we get right back.
[02:02:30.246 --> 02:02:30.526]  Sure.
[02:02:30.646 --> 02:02:31.326]  Can you hang on?
[02:02:31.427 --> 02:02:31.967]  Absolutely.
[02:02:32.607 --> 02:02:34.828]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[02:02:48.115 --> 02:02:53.577]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:54.017 --> 02:02:58.239]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:02:58.479 --> 02:03:05.521]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:05.901 --> 02:03:11.983]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:12.144 --> 02:03:13.344]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:13.404 --> 02:03:17.307]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:03:17.327 --> 02:03:19.449]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[02:04:45.194 --> 02:04:46.714]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:04:46.914 --> 02:04:49.995]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:04:50.115 --> 02:04:54.016]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:04:54.076 --> 02:04:58.297]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State to the Takeover.
[02:04:58.657 --> 02:05:02.418]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:05:02.498 --> 02:05:04.359]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:05:04.659 --> 02:05:07.860]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[02:05:07.900 --> 02:05:12.621]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:05:12.781 --> 02:05:15.822]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:05:16.002 --> 02:05:18.863]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:05:19.343 --> 02:05:25.465]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:05:26.005 --> 02:05:29.787]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:05:30.188 --> 02:05:31.568]  Order your video today.

[02:05:45.537 --> 02:05:47.758]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:48.318 --> 02:05:51.120]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.506 --> 02:06:06.147]  This is Erskine Sutton sitting in for Alex Jones.
[02:06:06.527 --> 02:06:11.048]  And we're talking, let's see, we're talking with Mike in Florida.
[02:06:11.068 --> 02:06:11.748]  Am I correct?
[02:06:11.868 --> 02:06:13.268]  Yes.
[02:06:13.308 --> 02:06:13.688]  Yes, Mike.
[02:06:14.269 --> 02:06:14.789]  Go ahead.
[02:06:14.809 --> 02:06:16.069]  Go ahead with what you were saying.
[02:06:16.409 --> 02:06:21.510]  I was commenting on the Texas woman Margie Schoendinger.
[02:06:22.210 --> 02:06:22.990]  Let me spell that.
[02:06:23.230 --> 02:06:28.892]  S-C-H-O-E-D-I-N-G-E-R filed a $50 million rape lawsuit against President Bush.
[02:06:29.272 --> 02:06:30.392]  And I was mentioning that
[02:06:31.184 --> 02:06:43.717]  How a lot of the people who have virtually taken themselves out of the fight, and they're thinking, well, Jesus will take care of everything, and you're looking at this, and you're saying, yeah, you better be standing up.
[02:06:43.797 --> 02:06:53.907]  If you're Christian, if you're Muslim, if you're Jewish, no matter what your religion is, you better be standing up, because these are people, the elitists are people who are not accepting...
[02:06:54.754 --> 02:06:56.835]  Any God except Satan.
[02:06:57.035 --> 02:06:58.956]  This is a battle against evil.
[02:06:59.077 --> 02:07:00.577]  They are anti-God.
[02:07:00.637 --> 02:07:02.058]  They are the anti-Christ.
[02:07:03.319 --> 02:07:08.922]  I'm sitting here looking at the 13 satanic bloodlines of the Illuminati by Fritz Springmeier.
[02:07:08.942 --> 02:07:10.323]  Somebody just mentioned it a moment ago.
[02:07:10.663 --> 02:07:16.846]  Oh yeah, Molson just mentioned that and he's saying most of the presidents of the United States have been part of that bloodline.
[02:07:16.866 --> 02:07:17.787]  Part of the bloodline.
[02:07:18.334 --> 02:07:18.554]  Yes.
[02:07:18.714 --> 02:07:26.880]  And like I said, you've got two skull and bones, two people who both took an oath to Satan, and they're running for presidents, and like we mentioned.
[02:07:27.481 --> 02:07:29.802]  Don't you think, Mike, that that's just a coincidence?
[02:07:30.023 --> 02:07:32.044]  I think that it's tragic.
[02:07:33.692 --> 02:07:34.693]  I think that is tragic.
[02:07:34.713 --> 02:07:39.615]  I think it is a joke on the American people because... I'll tell you what's worse.
[02:07:39.675 --> 02:07:53.423]  I had a gentleman on from the University of Ontario and he was talking about how the United States developed AIDS and how they also developed chronic fatigue and what they were using that for and some of the things.
[02:07:53.703 --> 02:07:56.785]  I mean, that was the most terrifying interview I've ever done.
[02:07:57.465 --> 02:07:58.546]  We've got to get back.
[02:07:58.646 --> 02:08:00.268]  We've got to get control of this country.
[02:08:00.408 --> 02:08:01.569]  It is just gone.
[02:08:01.589 --> 02:08:02.450]  It is gone.
[02:08:02.490 --> 02:08:03.951]  We've got to get control back.
[02:08:04.351 --> 02:08:05.593]  Well, here's my point.
[02:08:05.973 --> 02:08:13.159]  My point is that this woman is just one person who tried to fight back and unfortunately she lost.
[02:08:14.060 --> 02:08:17.643]  If you are reading the article like I read, she is now dead.
[02:08:17.943 --> 02:08:18.864]  She is now deceased.
[02:08:19.645 --> 02:08:22.748]  Found dead in her house, a bullet wound to her head.
[02:08:23.829 --> 02:08:24.009]  Now,
[02:08:24.853 --> 02:08:39.879]  If a woman can file a $50 million lawsuit against President George Bush, she said before she was killed that she was threatened not only by the police, but by FBI agents and people calling her home day and night.
[02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:45.902]  And then she is found dead with a bullet wound in the back of her head in her house.
[02:08:46.822 --> 02:08:53.085]  And that doesn't excite the press, and that doesn't excite anyone in government, and that doesn't excite anybody or people
[02:08:53.530 --> 02:08:59.575]  What does that say about where we are right now as a people, as living human beings?
[02:09:00.455 --> 02:09:08.722]  I had Al Martin on my radio program, and Al said there are only three things that are really going to wake up the American public.
[02:09:08.802 --> 02:09:11.404]  Number one, if NFL goes pay-per-view.
[02:09:12.004 --> 02:09:14.846]  Number two, if the beer trucks quit running.
[02:09:14.986 --> 02:09:19.150]  And number three, if Domino's quits delivering, then maybe America would wake up.
[02:09:19.190 --> 02:09:19.710]  Bingo!
[02:09:20.471 --> 02:09:22.192]  That's all we care about.
[02:09:22.968 --> 02:09:27.230]  Oh, and if women stop having sex with him, of course.
[02:09:28.050 --> 02:09:28.990]  That'll wake them up.
[02:09:30.331 --> 02:09:30.931]  Oh, yeah.
[02:09:30.971 --> 02:09:32.611]  You better believe that one.
[02:09:32.912 --> 02:09:34.012]  Thanks a lot, Mike.
[02:09:34.032 --> 02:09:35.532]  Let's go to Leon in Colorado.
[02:09:36.153 --> 02:09:36.813]  Hi, Leon.
[02:09:37.113 --> 02:09:39.674]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[02:09:39.774 --> 02:09:41.134]  Question, comment, whatever.
[02:09:41.514 --> 02:09:43.655]  Oh, thank you, Erskine.
[02:09:44.035 --> 02:09:51.538]  I was calling my representatives here, Allard and Campbell and Hefley.
[02:09:53.310 --> 02:09:57.012]  Well, that could be a perfect waste of time, and what happened?
[02:09:57.292 --> 02:10:10.678]  Well, no, I mean, I figure the only thing that's going to make them listen is if enough people get upset and get on their case.
[02:10:10.739 --> 02:10:13.280]  So I don't consider it a waste of time.
[02:10:14.941 --> 02:10:20.803]  We got them to back off of the assault weapon ban.
[02:10:22.762 --> 02:10:23.983]  Because they don't want to deal with it.
[02:10:25.084 --> 02:10:36.914]  Right, and you've also got, they've also taken some action where they aren't passing the hate crimes legislation, where the hate speech thing... Yeah, and people say it doesn't do any good, and it just infuriates me.
[02:10:37.654 --> 02:10:40.276]  I mean, that is the biggest cop-out.
[02:10:40.336 --> 02:10:42.158]  I'm sorry, that is a total cop-out.
[02:10:42.839 --> 02:10:44.700]  We've got to fight our battles.
[02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:48.282]  We've got to fight little battles, and hopefully we can win some of them.
[02:10:48.322 --> 02:10:55.085]  But if you've got a congressperson who is going to be responsive, God bless you, you're lucky, because a lot of them have their minds made up.
[02:10:55.105 --> 02:11:08.131]  Well, the thing that I found interesting, and this is what I wanted to comment on, Erskine, was I said, well, you know, this is another piece of outrageous, useless, worthless
[02:11:09.170 --> 02:11:11.271]  It's a piece of legislation.
[02:11:11.331 --> 02:11:12.371]  It's not law.
[02:11:12.591 --> 02:11:13.931]  It's just legislation.
[02:11:14.612 --> 02:11:29.416]  And I found it was really interesting that I said, well, certainly you've had other people call you and explain to you how the Patriot Act and the Homeland Security Act is a total violation of our Constitution.
[02:11:30.116 --> 02:11:31.096]  Oh, yeah, they've had that.
[02:11:31.136 --> 02:11:34.357]  Yeah, they all knew that.
[02:11:34.457 --> 02:11:36.558]  Somebody's been calling them and explaining it to them.
[02:11:37.250 --> 02:11:43.051]  And I explained to him, I said, you know, I said, the law is still the Constitution.
[02:11:43.132 --> 02:11:53.114]  It hasn't been repealed, and it hasn't been gotten rid of, and it's still the law of the land.
[02:11:53.174 --> 02:12:01.376]  And every congressman that I could find at the state convention, I asked them that question, and they all kind of sheepishly had to say, yes, it is the law.
[02:12:02.116 --> 02:12:03.237]  And they had no answer.
[02:12:05.310 --> 02:12:08.417]  Well, they didn't even have any answer to tell me why they are passing these unconstitutional laws.
[02:12:15.260 --> 02:12:17.941]  Okay, let me... I had an answer.
[02:12:17.961 --> 02:12:18.641]  Huh?
[02:12:19.001 --> 02:12:30.625]  I had an answer, and I was talking to Lee Hamilton, who is the co-chairman of the 9-11 Commission, a person who absolutely... No, we're not going to get into that.
[02:12:30.766 --> 02:12:40.349]  I asked Lee Hamilton, I said, Lee, now, as my congressman, I lived in southern Indiana at the time, I said, I've moved around a lot, so it sounds like I've been a lot of places.
[02:12:40.389 --> 02:12:41.249]  I've moved around a lot.
[02:12:41.569 --> 02:12:43.050]  So I asked Lee, I said, Lee,
[02:12:44.156 --> 02:12:47.519]  How the heck could you vote for this piece of legislation?
[02:12:47.539 --> 02:12:49.900]  Don't you know it has this, it has this, it has this?
[02:12:50.501 --> 02:12:51.942]  And I forgot what the thing was.
[02:12:52.022 --> 02:12:53.223]  It wasn't the Patriot Act.
[02:12:53.303 --> 02:12:57.406]  And he looked at me and he said, you know that's got 1,600 pages?
[02:12:57.466 --> 02:12:58.587]  We don't read that.
[02:12:58.667 --> 02:13:00.248]  We got it two days before.
[02:13:00.668 --> 02:13:04.091]  I said, then why are you voting on it if you don't know what's in it?
[02:13:04.211 --> 02:13:07.133]  Why are you voting things that you don't even know what's in it?
[02:13:07.413 --> 02:13:08.134]  What was his answer?
[02:13:09.699 --> 02:13:11.741]  He said, well, we have staff members who read it.
[02:13:11.921 --> 02:13:13.442]  And I'm saying, that's not good enough.
[02:13:13.522 --> 02:13:17.826]  I'm not paying you as my representative to have a staff member who reads it.
[02:13:18.167 --> 02:13:25.493]  I'm paying you to... And if you have to have a staff member, if it takes 1,600 pages... Look, Moses had, what, Ten Commandments?
[02:13:25.713 --> 02:13:27.455]  It wasn't real complicated.
[02:13:27.895 --> 02:13:30.117]  I mean, you don't have to have a Ph.D.
[02:13:30.177 --> 02:13:30.758]  to read them
[02:13:31.178 --> 02:13:38.061]  How many laws do we have and how many pages of laws do we have coming down every day that you have to be a Philadelphia lawyer to read?
[02:13:38.141 --> 02:13:43.743]  And how many little sneaky innuendos and different things can they put in there?
[02:13:43.783 --> 02:13:46.344]  There are two things they say that you shouldn't watch being made.
[02:13:46.524 --> 02:13:48.564]  One is the law and the other one is sausage.
[02:13:48.584 --> 02:13:50.405]  And I think you're probably pretty well right.
[02:13:50.545 --> 02:13:54.406]  The gentleman that was calling from out of... I didn't get this where he was, foreign country.
[02:13:55.367 --> 02:13:58.708]  You know, everything he says is in the Constitution.
[02:13:59.569 --> 02:14:06.615]  But the problem is that they are all, not all, you can't say all and never.
[02:14:07.436 --> 02:14:09.618]  No, we've got people like Ron Paul who are good people now.
[02:14:09.638 --> 02:14:12.360]  Yeah, right, he's a great guy, and there's a few others that are okay.
[02:14:13.020 --> 02:14:17.164]  But I think maybe if we're really lucky, there'd be a hundred.
[02:14:17.921 --> 02:14:21.725]  We could find that would even be partially... Oh, you're pushing it, Leon.
[02:14:21.786 --> 02:14:23.267]  You're pushing it with 100.
[02:14:23.327 --> 02:14:24.048]  Now, come on.
[02:14:24.168 --> 02:14:26.251]  You've got to back off of that one a little bit.
[02:14:27.712 --> 02:14:26.251]  50?
[02:14:28.253 --> 02:14:31.637]  50?
[02:14:28.613 --> 02:14:31.637]  This is like Moses talking to God, huh?
[02:14:32.666 --> 02:14:33.647]  You got it.
[02:14:33.747 --> 02:14:37.129]  Anyway, I just think that you're absolutely right.
[02:14:37.209 --> 02:14:40.871]  There are so many of them that are actual criminals.
[02:14:40.991 --> 02:14:43.233]  They are involved in criminal behavior.
[02:14:44.333 --> 02:14:44.914]  Sure they are.
[02:14:44.954 --> 02:14:46.715]  Look what Lyndon Johnson had.
[02:14:46.775 --> 02:14:48.836]  All he had to do was open his book.
[02:14:49.436 --> 02:14:53.599]  And the fancy word that was in it is called malfeasance.
[02:14:54.319 --> 02:14:55.320]  Malfeasance.
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:59.522]  That's a fancy word that our founding fathers called it.
[02:14:59.622 --> 02:15:00.383]  Malfeasance.
[02:15:01.676 --> 02:15:04.859]  Yeah, we just called good old-fashioned crookedness.
[02:15:06.040 --> 02:15:08.903]  But I'm just saying, I'm plugging call them.
[02:15:09.183 --> 02:15:12.407]  If we don't call them, I've got a clear conscience.
[02:15:12.747 --> 02:15:15.249]  I call, I complain, I confront them.
[02:15:16.250 --> 02:15:17.972]  I am a persona non grata.
[02:15:18.012 --> 02:15:20.915]  That means a very undesirable person.
[02:15:21.730 --> 02:15:29.914]  You know, Leon, there are two things that in most cases need to be changed, and that's congressmen and babies, and both of them for the same reason.
[02:15:30.115 --> 02:15:31.455]  You take care, Leon.
[02:15:33.216 --> 02:15:34.697]  Let's go to Paul in Delaware.
[02:15:34.737 --> 02:15:35.337]  Hi, Paul.
[02:15:35.758 --> 02:15:38.539]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[02:15:38.919 --> 02:15:39.960]  How are you doing, Nurse Ken?
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:40.960]  I hope you're doing very good.
[02:15:41.020 --> 02:15:42.301]  I'm doing fine.
[02:15:42.461 --> 02:15:49.285]  My call was because you were calling about Ted Gunderson, and I have some important information I would like to talk to you since you're going to be interviewing him.
[02:15:49.966 --> 02:15:57.489]  There's a reason why Alex Jones does not have that guy on his show, and I'm going to tell you a couple of reasons, and I hope that you ask him these pertinent questions.
[02:15:58.110 --> 02:16:08.854]  After the Oklahoma City bombing, he came out saying that there was a pineapple bomb who did it, and his informant was a gentleman, ex-CIA agent, now in prison for 30 years, named Michael Reconosuto.
[02:16:10.115 --> 02:16:17.738]  And now he's running around the country with 9-11 information, talking about this same guy that's been locked up for 30 years, or got a 30-year sentence,
[02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:20.642]  Is furnishing information to him about 9-11.
[02:16:21.102 --> 02:16:25.986]  And what I can say is there's a reason why Alex Jones does not have Ted Gunterson on his show.
[02:16:26.707 --> 02:16:29.209]  And that's because he's not to be trusted.
[02:16:29.369 --> 02:16:31.170]  I think he's playing both ends of the field.
[02:16:31.611 --> 02:16:37.695]  And I'll tell you, when you get this guy on your show, thrill him about his 9-11 information.
[02:16:38.156 --> 02:16:43.580]  And quite frankly, every bit of information I've ever gotten from this guy or researched on him
[02:16:44.170 --> 02:16:46.331]  It's just been a bunch of nonsense.
[02:16:46.731 --> 02:16:52.232]  There's another guy that he travels around with, a pathological liar named Stu Webb.
[02:16:52.292 --> 02:16:54.153]  He doesn't have anything to do with Stu Webb.
[02:16:54.173 --> 02:16:55.993]  They totally just separate him apart.
[02:16:56.073 --> 02:17:06.576]  That's funny because I've got him on a video tape where Ted Gunnarsson is interviewing him with an FBI symbol behind his radio station program.
[02:17:06.736 --> 02:17:07.736]  My second question is this.
[02:17:08.776 --> 02:17:11.257]  How do I get on the air because Erskine
[02:17:12.523 --> 02:17:15.744]  If Alex has you hosting, I think I can do a better job.
[02:17:17.225 --> 02:17:22.026]  Well, you just contact GCN and Alex and maybe you can get on.
[02:17:22.206 --> 02:17:25.387]  That's a really wonderful idea, so lots of luck to you there.
[02:17:26.268 --> 02:17:31.529]  And we'll be right back with Joanna, and we've got a couple of news stories for you.
[02:17:31.689 --> 02:17:34.970]  And Paul, I hope you get the opportunity sometime.
[02:17:35.010 --> 02:17:39.612]  We'd certainly love to hear from you, but get your facts straight about who's friends with who before you go on.
[02:17:45.695 --> 02:17:48.977]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:17:49.017 --> 02:17:53.220]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:17:53.461 --> 02:17:56.243]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:17:56.443 --> 02:17:58.844]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:17:59.025 --> 02:18:07.671]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:18:07.851 --> 02:18:09.212]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:18:09.412 --> 02:18:13.575]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:18:13.815 --> 02:18:14.536]  Not yet available?
[02:18:45.596 --> 02:18:47.977]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:18:48.238 --> 02:18:52.060]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:18:52.380 --> 02:18:53.200]  Read the labels.
[02:18:53.620 --> 02:18:57.743]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:18:57.963 --> 02:19:02.165]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucus membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:19:02.545 --> 02:19:07.408]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:19:07.788 --> 02:19:11.370]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:19:11.550 --> 02:19:16.892]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:19:17.172 --> 02:19:19.913]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:19:20.193 --> 02:19:21.093]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:19:21.394 --> 02:19:32.138]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[02:19:45.279 --> 02:19:49.180]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:19:49.400 --> 02:20:01.683]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:20:02.103 --> 02:20:02.503]  The U.S.
[02:20:02.543 --> 02:20:08.125]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:20:08.525 --> 02:20:10.726]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:20:12.606 --> 02:20:13.066]  We're good to go.
[02:20:33.420 --> 02:20:33.641]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[02:20:44.978 --> 02:20:53.043]  We at Activex American Incorporated would like to thank our faithful customers for making SynFlex one of the leading glucosamine and chondroitin formulas on the market today.
[02:20:53.604 --> 02:21:07.553]  Our liquid glucosamine complex not only combines pharmaceutical quality glucosamine and chondroitin, but also contains natural anti-inflammatories that can help reduce pain and inflammation without the harmful side effects that can occur from taking pharmaceutical drugs.
[02:21:07.953 --> 02:21:08.473]  We're good to go.
[02:21:08.493 --> 02:21:08.653]  I think?
[02:21:29.679 --> 02:21:30.019]  We're good to go.
[02:21:58.644 --> 02:22:05.290]  This program, on this network, on my program, Erskine Overnight, we don't screen calls.
[02:22:05.490 --> 02:22:06.651]  This isn't Rush Limbaugh.
[02:22:06.891 --> 02:22:10.715]  We'll take any caller if you want to say something good, bad, or indifferent.
[02:22:11.015 --> 02:22:17.701]  We'll take your call, because I've found that a lot of people have a lot to say, and so we try to take everyone's calls.
[02:22:17.761 --> 02:22:21.043]  Now, I also learned a long time ago, never argue with an idiot.
[02:22:21.404 --> 02:22:24.747]  You drag them down to your level, and then they're going to beat you with experience.
[02:22:26.079 --> 02:22:29.040]  One of the news stories that just hit right now.
[02:22:29.140 --> 02:22:32.582]  Suicide bomb is rocking Baghdad even as we're talking.
[02:22:32.922 --> 02:22:37.784]  Two suicide car bombs hit central Baghdad within hours of each other, killing at least five people.
[02:22:38.144 --> 02:22:42.906]  The dead are reported to be from a police convoy targeted in the Rashad Street district.
[02:22:43.506 --> 02:22:53.354]  After an earlier blast near a checkpoint, BBC's Mike Duncan in Baghdad said the blast came amid a security, massive security crackdown across the capital city.
[02:22:53.735 --> 02:22:59.540]  Witnesses said an attacker drove up a convoy of six police vehicles before blowing up his car.
[02:22:59.900 --> 02:23:02.842]  A large crater was gouged in the road and U.S.
[02:23:02.862 --> 02:23:06.766]  troops and Iraqi police tried to clear the area as an ambulance rushed to treat the wounded.
[02:23:07.086 --> 02:23:09.127]  About 20 people were injured in the blast.
[02:23:09.488 --> 02:23:11.970]  The bomber was driving a Chevy Malibu.
[02:23:12.754 --> 02:23:21.557]  Crisis car against the police vehicle and five of police colleagues were killed and eight of their patrol cars were damaged.
[02:23:22.037 --> 02:23:27.679]  The lieutenant there said his shirt was totally drenched in blood.
[02:23:28.139 --> 02:23:37.923]  So the attacks keep coming and coming and coming in Iraq that today on top of the earlier explosions and what's been going on on top of the
[02:23:38.843 --> 02:23:52.372]  Announcement by the National Security Council that, yes, they're going to have a civil war coming up next year, and on top of the Council, Kofi Annan of the UN, who said, hey, you know, the actions are illegal.
[02:23:52.732 --> 02:24:03.839]  Let's go to the lines, and I've got a friend of mine, a very dear friend of mine, a wonderful person who does a program on GCN that you may want to listen to every night,
[02:24:04.477 --> 02:24:06.238]  Pastor Butch Paul.
[02:24:06.698 --> 02:24:09.940]  Pastor Paul, welcome to the Alex Jones program.
[02:24:09.960 --> 02:24:16.224]  I just wanted you to say something, give your program just a bit of a plug, and good to always talk with you, sir.
[02:24:16.244 --> 02:24:17.084]  Well, thank you, Erskine.
[02:24:17.204 --> 02:24:18.745]  It's an honor to be with you, and I really mean that.
[02:24:18.785 --> 02:24:19.626]  Thank you so much.
[02:24:19.686 --> 02:24:22.127]  I know we have a program scheduled together some night soon, don't we?
[02:24:22.988 --> 02:24:23.928]  We certainly do.
[02:24:24.008 --> 02:24:26.510]  We did one last week or the week before last.
[02:24:26.570 --> 02:24:29.732]  Now, give the time that your program is on so people can listen.
[02:24:29.772 --> 02:24:30.932]  I want 9 o'clock p.m.
[02:24:31.112 --> 02:24:31.913]  Eastern time.
[02:24:32.638 --> 02:24:34.559]  And if you listen on shortwave, I'm on 7535 and 7580.
[02:24:34.739 --> 02:24:44.623]  And, of course, we're on the Internet at GCNlive.com or call2decision.com.
[02:24:45.284 --> 02:24:48.365]  And we try to put out the truth five nights a week just like you do.
[02:24:48.445 --> 02:24:50.446]  And we appreciate you and what you're doing.
[02:24:50.506 --> 02:24:51.847]  I just listened to that last caller.
[02:24:51.887 --> 02:24:52.727]  The guy's a jerk.
[02:24:53.514 --> 02:24:57.316]  That's exactly why he'll never have a program he's on, because he's a jerk.
[02:24:57.336 --> 02:25:01.918]  You cannot be a jerk and do a program.
[02:25:02.038 --> 02:25:06.860]  Anyway, what you're talking about, what's happening, I just listened to the report you talked about in Iraq there.
[02:25:07.340 --> 02:25:09.821]  These people in Iraq obviously don't want us there.
[02:25:09.921 --> 02:25:13.142]  Obviously they think they're fighting for their sovereignty, and I can agree with them.
[02:25:13.602 --> 02:25:15.263]  I don't want to see our troops in harm's way.
[02:25:15.303 --> 02:25:16.263]  We should bring them home.
[02:25:16.644 --> 02:25:19.665]  But I also don't want to see innocent people killed that did nothing to us.
[02:25:20.705 --> 02:25:22.146]  And Iraq did nothing to us.
[02:25:23.431 --> 02:25:23.751]  All right.
[02:25:24.052 --> 02:25:26.053]  Thoroughly, I couldn't agree more with you.
[02:25:26.093 --> 02:25:30.457]  By the way, Pastor Butch, I've got some apple butter going your way.
[02:25:30.497 --> 02:25:31.878]  You'll be getting that this next week.
[02:25:31.938 --> 02:25:32.879]  Oh, my goodness.
[02:25:32.919 --> 02:25:33.739]  Don't ask why.
[02:25:33.819 --> 02:25:35.240]  Don't ask any questions about it.
[02:25:35.300 --> 02:25:36.141]  I've got that.
[02:25:36.221 --> 02:25:40.825]  I've got some homemade HB sauce made from some of our plums and lots of goodies going to you.
[02:25:41.105 --> 02:25:42.306]  Oh, my goodness gracious.
[02:25:42.486 --> 02:25:44.828]  You're going to have some to put on your hot biscuits.
[02:25:45.028 --> 02:25:45.548]  All right.
[02:25:45.588 --> 02:25:46.789]  That sounds great to me.
[02:25:47.110 --> 02:25:51.213]  Now, Urshan, I know we've got a program scheduled to get a one-night on your program, I think.
[02:25:51.273 --> 02:25:52.114]  What night is that again?
[02:25:52.794 --> 02:25:59.600]  We're going to be scheduling that for the middle of October, and we've also got a program where I'll be talking with you on the 23rd.
[02:25:59.721 --> 02:26:01.522]  The 23rd is going to be your broadcast.
[02:26:01.542 --> 02:26:04.785]  As far as I know, I'll not be here, so you'll have it all to yourself.
[02:26:05.606 --> 02:26:06.166]  You got it.
[02:26:06.707 --> 02:26:10.390]  Pastor Butch, thank you for being on, and your program is on.
[02:26:10.591 --> 02:26:14.794]  Give that website and all the information about the program where it is.
[02:26:15.035 --> 02:26:15.735]  Shortwave at 7535.
[02:26:18.175 --> 02:26:18.335]  And 7580.
[02:26:18.395 --> 02:26:24.282]  We're on calltodecision.com, which right now, by the way, is in the process of being updated.
[02:26:24.302 --> 02:26:25.743]  It may be off and on for a while.
[02:26:26.244 --> 02:26:28.566]  And GCNlive.com.
[02:26:28.586 --> 02:26:30.468]  I'd love to have everybody join in.
[02:26:30.508 --> 02:26:30.809]  Let's do it.
[02:26:30.829 --> 02:26:31.990]  See you tonight, 9 o'clock p.m.
[02:26:32.410 --> 02:26:33.031]  Eastern Time.
[02:26:33.912 --> 02:26:34.793]  Monday through Friday.
[02:26:34.813 --> 02:26:35.554]  Monday through Friday.
[02:26:36.573 --> 02:26:37.013]  Thank you.
[02:26:37.254 --> 02:26:37.994]  You're welcome, sir.
[02:26:38.034 --> 02:26:39.255]  Have a great day, Erskine.
[02:26:39.736 --> 02:26:40.336]  You're my buddy.
[02:26:40.356 --> 02:26:40.897]  You know that.
[02:26:41.017 --> 02:26:41.717]  Thank you.
[02:26:41.737 --> 02:26:42.218]  Same here.
[02:26:42.438 --> 02:26:42.858]  Okay.
[02:26:42.878 --> 02:26:43.319]  Bye-bye.
[02:26:43.459 --> 02:26:45.240]  Let's go to Jean in Pennsylvania.
[02:26:45.280 --> 02:26:45.861]  Hi, Jean.
[02:26:46.001 --> 02:26:47.522]  Welcome to Alex Jones' program.
[02:26:48.022 --> 02:26:48.763]  Hello, Erskine.
[02:26:49.223 --> 02:26:50.505]  We're really enjoying your show.
[02:26:51.485 --> 02:26:59.532]  What I wanted to tell you is I called my congressman, I called my senator, and it sounded like I had people on the line, but it sounded like a recording.
[02:27:00.913 --> 02:27:05.457]  I said, how did they stand on voting for the CIA head?
[02:27:07.173 --> 02:27:15.917]  All three of the people I spoke to said, well, I haven't discussed that with him, but I'm sure he'll let us know.
[02:27:15.977 --> 02:27:16.677]  And I said, when?
[02:27:16.737 --> 02:27:18.278]  And he said, when he votes.
[02:27:19.338 --> 02:27:21.359]  Oh, yeah, when he votes to give me the bums.
[02:27:21.439 --> 02:27:23.279]  Rush, hold on, Jean, because you've been waiting.
[02:27:23.339 --> 02:27:24.860]  I want to talk with you a little bit more.
[02:27:25.220 --> 02:27:27.941]  And Brooke, Tim, we'll certainly be with you.
[02:27:28.061 --> 02:27:32.943]  So we'll be right back on the Alex Jones Radio Show, www.infowars.com.
[02:27:35.803 --> 02:27:36.705]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.206 --> 02:27:38.809]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.730 --> 02:27:42.415]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.494 --> 02:27:47.975]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[02:27:48.175 --> 02:27:55.520]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[02:27:55.820 --> 02:28:00.243]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:28:00.523 --> 02:28:10.349]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[02:28:10.729 --> 02:28:11.670]  We're good to go.
[02:28:29.005 --> 02:28:31.328]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[02:28:31.348 --> 02:28:32.029]  It's powerful stuff.
[02:28:45.976 --> 02:28:46.357]  Thank you.
[02:29:06.940 --> 02:29:13.842]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:29:28.727 --> 02:29:29.147]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.191 --> 02:29:45.331]  Call 800-348-4100.
[02:29:45.351 --> 02:29:45.531]  That's 800-348-4100.
[02:30:15.157 --> 02:30:16.077]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.
[02:30:16.117 --> 02:30:23.300]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[02:30:23.560 --> 02:30:26.481]  Sponsorship is critical at both local and national levels.
[02:30:26.681 --> 02:30:32.363]  If you have a business product or message that could benefit from this broadcast locally, call the station you're listening to.
[02:30:32.623 --> 02:30:35.144]  For national exposure, call 877-996-4327.
[02:30:36.844 --> 02:30:41.586]  Become a part of the Genesis team by calling your local station or call the national line at 877-996-4327.
[02:30:45.612 --> 02:30:46.013]  Woo!
[02:30:46.053 --> 02:30:46.253]  Woo!
[02:30:56.971 --> 02:30:59.914]  This is Erskine sitting in for... not sitting in.
[02:31:00.754 --> 02:31:03.277]  Yeah, just sitting in, not substituting for Alex Jones.
[02:31:03.297 --> 02:31:05.539]  There is no substitute for Alex Jones.
[02:31:05.879 --> 02:31:11.564]  He'll be back here Monday, and his hard-hitting news and reports will be with you Monday.
[02:31:12.024 --> 02:31:17.189]  He's on a little vacation right now, and hopefully he and Violet are having a wonderful time.
[02:31:17.689 --> 02:31:19.710]  We're talking now with Jean in Pennsylvania.
[02:31:19.730 --> 02:31:21.750]  I'd just like to make one really quick comment.
[02:31:22.331 --> 02:31:28.713]  I think one of the things, and we've had a couple of callers who have asked, I think Richard in Colorado asked about this.
[02:31:28.793 --> 02:31:30.373]  I know Mike in Florida was concerned.
[02:31:30.453 --> 02:31:31.874]  What can we actually do?
[02:31:32.014 --> 02:31:36.355]  One of the things we can do to protect ourselves is to make sure that you get some gold.
[02:31:36.956 --> 02:31:39.156]  Actually take possession of some gold.
[02:31:39.536 --> 02:31:41.057]  Contact Midas Resources.
[02:31:41.697 --> 02:31:49.442]  One of the places that I would recommend to look for purchasing gold because the dollar is not going to hold up.
[02:31:49.842 --> 02:31:54.124]  Everybody we've had on has been telling us that the dollar is not going to be holding up.
[02:31:54.544 --> 02:31:57.246]  Have yourself some gold for your own protection.
[02:31:57.938 --> 02:31:59.119]  For your own protection.
[02:31:59.459 --> 02:32:01.940]  The value of gold has nowhere to go but up.
[02:32:01.980 --> 02:32:05.021]  They can't keep it artificially down much longer.
[02:32:05.501 --> 02:32:06.581]  So look for that.
[02:32:06.882 --> 02:32:14.925]  The other thing is we may see oil prices, gas prices rising to about $3 a gallon coming up very, very shortly.
[02:32:15.405 --> 02:32:19.347]  They've taken off the gas taxes, but it takes about six weeks for it to hit.
[02:32:19.427 --> 02:32:20.167]  And if it hits...
[02:32:20.788 --> 02:32:24.390]  Man, I'm telling you, it's going to make a major difference and could make a difference in the election.
[02:32:24.430 --> 02:32:26.071]  Let's go to Jean in Pennsylvania.
[02:32:26.391 --> 02:32:30.233]  Jean, yes ma'am, we were talking before and you've got a comment that you wanted to make.
[02:32:30.913 --> 02:32:42.439]  I was just saying, sir, it sounded like all the three individuals I spoke to had a script in front of them telling me, oh, we'll pass this along, but I haven't spoken to that senator, I haven't spoken to the congressman about this.
[02:32:43.283 --> 02:32:45.244]  And I said, well, you've only got a few more days.
[02:32:45.784 --> 02:32:48.746]  And my congressman is in Iraq visiting the troops.
[02:32:49.827 --> 02:32:52.228]  And he should be back now in time to vote.
[02:32:53.448 --> 02:32:56.670]  Well, my friend Claire Wolf calls them Congress Critters.
[02:32:57.431 --> 02:33:00.692]  And she's not too far wrong when she calls them Congress Critters.
[02:33:00.792 --> 02:33:03.634]  I mean, they are like little critters that sort of scurry around.
[02:33:04.474 --> 02:33:05.875]  And I don't know what to tell you.
[02:33:06.035 --> 02:33:07.616]  I just don't know what to tell you.
[02:33:07.776 --> 02:33:09.297]  I agree with...
[02:33:10.029 --> 02:33:14.614]  With our friend who called and said, listen, we need to be in touch with them.
[02:33:14.634 --> 02:33:15.475]  We can't give up.
[02:33:15.575 --> 02:33:17.477]  And I applaud you for doing that.
[02:33:17.537 --> 02:33:19.438]  We've got to keep the pressure up on them.
[02:33:19.839 --> 02:33:30.429]  And if they know that enough people care and enough people are concerned, both the new voting laws and the way they've got the voting rigged and set up, I don't know if we can ever get some of these people out.
[02:33:30.630 --> 02:33:32.852]  I do honestly believe that
[02:33:33.656 --> 02:33:39.279]  Our Congress people need to be changed, and for the same reason the babies need to be changed.
[02:33:39.299 --> 02:33:44.061]  They both need to be changed occasionally, and it's time to get... Hey, I'm staying there too long.
[02:33:44.101 --> 02:33:45.662]  It doesn't matter which party they are.
[02:33:46.122 --> 02:33:49.844]  They seem to just get ingrained in the corruption, don't they?
[02:33:50.284 --> 02:33:54.827]  Well, I think Pennsylvania's in a rich territory.
[02:33:57.370 --> 02:33:57.870]  Absolutely.
[02:33:58.050 --> 02:34:00.351]  I can't believe that man was your governor at one time.
[02:34:00.371 --> 02:34:00.431]  Wow!
[02:34:02.192 --> 02:34:04.213]  And safer also, sir.
[02:34:04.953 --> 02:34:15.418]  Ed Hines, and then you've got, what's his name, one-shot Arlen Specter, the guy on the Warren Commission came up with the one-bullet theory.
[02:34:15.498 --> 02:34:18.479]  I mean, you go follow that one as far as you want to.
[02:34:18.819 --> 02:34:23.321]  And then they came after a little gun dealer, Darryl Civic.
[02:34:23.381 --> 02:34:24.402]  I don't know if you heard that.
[02:34:25.285 --> 02:34:26.046]  Oh, I heard that.
[02:34:26.166 --> 02:34:32.930]  And Pennsylvania's also the home, however, of Benjamin Franklin, who said, if you give up freedom for security, you end up with neither.
[02:34:33.210 --> 02:34:35.351]  Pennsylvania's given America a lot.
[02:34:35.671 --> 02:34:42.195]  They've given a lot of good, and unfortunately, recently, they've given some bad, too.
[02:34:42.275 --> 02:34:42.495]  Right.
[02:34:42.515 --> 02:34:46.498]  I hope more people call in to them so that they'll have a better script next time.
[02:34:47.518 --> 02:34:48.819]  Yes, let's hope they do.
[02:34:49.139 --> 02:34:50.700]  Let's go to Tim in Wisconsin.
[02:34:50.720 --> 02:34:52.521]  Where in Wisconsin are you located, Tim?
[02:34:54.543 --> 02:34:54.603]  St.
[02:34:54.763 --> 02:34:54.963]  Frank's.
[02:34:56.010 --> 02:34:56.830]  Tim, are you there?
[02:34:56.910 --> 02:34:57.171]  Yeah.
[02:34:58.091 --> 02:34:59.351]  Where in Wisconsin are you?
[02:34:59.371 --> 02:35:00.192]  Stevens Point.
[02:35:01.132 --> 02:35:02.373]  Oh, I've had their beer.
[02:35:02.393 --> 02:35:03.233]  They got Point beer.
[02:35:03.253 --> 02:35:04.894]  They only sell it in like 20 counties.
[02:35:05.854 --> 02:35:15.458]  Yeah, I wanted to talk about the level of ignorance that I was noticing.
[02:35:15.478 --> 02:35:16.578]  Okay.
[02:35:16.618 --> 02:35:18.939]  We can barely hear you, Tim, so make it very quick.
[02:35:19.340 --> 02:35:20.720]  Yeah, about the Patriot Act.
[02:35:23.481 --> 02:35:24.982]  On a radio station, when I hear...
[02:35:25.649 --> 02:35:26.810]  Well, I think we need to redo it.
[02:35:26.830 --> 02:35:29.212]  I think we need to throw it out.
[02:35:29.232 --> 02:35:32.474]  I think it's not a war against terror.
[02:35:32.574 --> 02:35:34.375]  It's a war against the American public.
[02:35:34.395 --> 02:35:34.475]  Yeah.
[02:35:52.677 --> 02:35:55.138]  I think it certainly is a war against the American public.
[02:35:55.418 --> 02:36:00.641]  Listen, we're on WTDY in Madison on Saturday night, so be sure to listen to Erskine Overnight there.
[02:36:00.681 --> 02:36:02.582]  You can get it in Stevens Point real good.
[02:36:03.122 --> 02:36:08.685]  So listen to Erskine Overnight on WTDY, the big station out of Madison.
[02:36:08.845 --> 02:36:10.105]  It's like 1610, 1620.
[02:36:10.405 --> 02:36:12.867]  Just go all the way as far right as you can go and you'll get it.
[02:36:13.207 --> 02:36:14.167]  Thanks for the call, Tim.
[02:36:14.187 --> 02:36:14.968]  Let's go to Brooke.
[02:36:15.428 --> 02:36:15.968]  Thank you, sir.
[02:36:16.328 --> 02:36:18.169]  Let's go to Brooke in Rhode Island.
[02:36:18.189 --> 02:36:19.530]  We're getting real close on time.
[02:36:19.590 --> 02:36:20.110]  Hi, Brooke.
[02:36:21.024 --> 02:36:21.965]  Hey, hi Erskine.
[02:36:22.105 --> 02:36:24.927]  Thanks for taking my call and I hope you can hear me alright.
[02:36:25.628 --> 02:36:26.769]  Absolutely perfectly.
[02:36:26.809 --> 02:36:28.470]  You're sounding much, much better.
[02:36:28.510 --> 02:36:31.052]  The phone with Tim was breaking up.
[02:36:31.152 --> 02:36:31.833]  I'm sorry, Tim.
[02:36:31.873 --> 02:36:33.234]  We had a lot of trouble hearing you.
[02:36:33.614 --> 02:36:34.155]  Yes, Brooke?
[02:36:34.495 --> 02:36:40.340]  Well, sometimes it's very difficult to hear the show because I'm having a very hard time hearing it too.
[02:36:40.980 --> 02:36:43.482]  But I have a comment and I have a question.
[02:36:43.702 --> 02:36:50.568]  And I'll ask the question first because maybe your producer can look it up for me while we're discussing my comment.
[02:36:51.584 --> 02:36:56.607]  I wanted the author of the 13 Satanic Bloodlines because I didn't get it.
[02:36:57.988 --> 02:37:00.189]  That was Springmeyer.
[02:37:00.829 --> 02:37:01.430]  Springmeyer?
[02:37:02.090 --> 02:37:03.411]  Springmeyer, right.
[02:37:04.011 --> 02:37:09.975]  Right, because there have been two or three people who had mentioned that and his name is Springmeyer, right.
[02:37:10.835 --> 02:37:19.260]  Okay, my comment is people have been calling in to ask what we should do and this is something that's plagued me also.
[02:37:20.733 --> 02:37:25.756]  In the 1820s in America, our nation was faced with a similar crisis.
[02:37:26.596 --> 02:37:40.763]  And this was the beginning of the anti-Masonic movement, the anti-Masonic party, and John Quincy Adams was one of the first champions of this anti-Masonic movement.
[02:37:41.203 --> 02:37:49.447]  He actually ran as an anti-Masonic and won a seat in Congress and ran for the presidency and won.
[02:37:50.100 --> 02:38:11.740]  There were governors put in in New York, in Pennsylvania, in Vermont, in Rhode Island, members of Congress in Washington and in the state capitals, and this was incidentally the first political party in America to give a convention, and this was the first third political party in America.
[02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:11.800]  In 1991,
[02:38:14.184 --> 02:38:21.552]  We came very close to doing this exact same thing with Ross Perot and the Reform Party.
[02:38:21.572 --> 02:38:28.360]  And if we could do it in 1991, why can't we reinstitute the Anti-Masonic Party?
[02:38:28.820 --> 02:38:31.944]  Because the only other means is riots in the streets.
[02:38:33.470 --> 02:38:36.491]  Well, either you've got the ballot or you've got the bullet, it seems.
[02:38:36.752 --> 02:38:44.375]  And it certainly is time to institute a party that can come in and say, we're tired of the Illuminati, we're ready to take over.
[02:38:45.335 --> 02:38:48.617]  You all just kindly move aside, or we'll move you aside.
[02:38:48.957 --> 02:38:50.658]  You got it right, Brooke.
[02:38:51.158 --> 02:39:05.847]  But John Quincy Adams, I strongly suggest the callers try to read something about biographies on John Quincy Adams because we should find out what he did and how he went about doing this and why he was so successful.
[02:39:06.107 --> 02:39:11.410]  He was very successful because this lasted for a long time and this was a major party.
[02:39:11.890 --> 02:39:17.113]  And this party was not like a wussy kind of party that was, you know, like Jesse Ventura or Ross Perot.
[02:39:17.393 --> 02:39:18.894]  This was a real third party.
[02:39:18.934 --> 02:39:20.255]  They gave the first convention.
[02:39:21.369 --> 02:39:26.972]  And it stayed together until about 1860, until about the Civil War it stayed together.
[02:39:27.413 --> 02:39:32.575]  And the other thing that happened with third parties is a lot of their planks were adopted by the other parties.
[02:39:32.796 --> 02:39:35.657]  And this is one of the things that I really wonder about.
[02:39:36.077 --> 02:39:40.420]  You've got people like Petroica on the Constitution Party.
[02:39:40.440 --> 02:39:49.365]  You've got people like Benake on the Libertarian Party who are on enough states to be elected President of the United States
[02:39:49.725 --> 02:39:54.369]  They're qualified into all these states, and they won't let them into the debates.
[02:39:54.809 --> 02:39:57.532]  They don't want to hear what a third party is saying.
[02:39:57.572 --> 02:39:59.693]  They've got it controlled just with two parties.
[02:40:00.034 --> 02:40:02.876]  Nowhere in the Constitution does it say you've got two parties.
[02:40:03.356 --> 02:40:12.904]  But Ross Perot did pretty well in 1991, because Erskine, you remember in June of 1991, Ross Perot was the head of Bill Clinton.
[02:40:13.165 --> 02:40:18.389]  If it wasn't for something about Ross Perot's daughter's marriage that happened in July...
[02:40:18.869 --> 02:40:21.410]  Ross Perot would have been the candidate.
[02:40:21.570 --> 02:40:23.051]  That's how close he was.
[02:40:23.391 --> 02:40:26.372]  Well, in Utah he came in second.
[02:40:26.832 --> 02:40:27.452]  Yes, yes.
[02:40:27.552 --> 02:40:39.857]  Now the thing about what happened with the anti-Masonic party, from what I've read about it, it apparently was infiltrated by Masons later on in order to bring it down.
[02:40:40.911 --> 02:40:45.538]  Infiltrated, but the other thing that happened was so many of their planks were accepted by the other parties.
[02:40:46.038 --> 02:40:52.086]  And so its reason for existence became unnecessary because other parties had adopted a lot of their planks.
[02:40:52.447 --> 02:40:55.171]  And that's why we need to hear what these third parties are saying.
[02:40:55.671 --> 02:40:56.112]  I don't agree.
[02:40:56.152 --> 02:40:58.353]  I may not agree with everything the libertarians are saying.
[02:40:58.413 --> 02:41:01.315]  I may not agree with everything the constitutionalists are saying.
[02:41:01.715 --> 02:41:03.156]  But they've got something to say.
[02:41:03.196 --> 02:41:08.659]  They've got something to add to the mix rather than Tweedledum and Tweedledummer, Skull and Bones, Skull and Bones.
[02:41:08.959 --> 02:41:10.480]  They've got something to add to it.
[02:41:10.520 --> 02:41:11.480]  We have no choice.
[02:41:12.141 --> 02:41:14.182]  Ralph Nader, excuse me, I didn't mean to cut you off.
[02:41:14.202 --> 02:41:15.462]  We got a little passionate there.
[02:41:15.482 --> 02:41:18.824]  But Ralph Nader is affiliated with the same group.
[02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:26.422]  Well, his campaign director is Scullum Bowen's attorney.
[02:41:26.882 --> 02:41:27.923]  Yes, yes.
[02:41:27.983 --> 02:41:35.406]  The other thing is Michael Perruca actually sounds like quite a well-spoken and interesting, intelligent man.
[02:41:35.426 --> 02:41:41.228]  I don't know if there's any way you can get an interview with him, but he was the one that impressed me the most all along.
[02:41:42.183 --> 02:41:47.849]  But it's been very difficult to hear him because, of course, nobody wants to cover him, and the mainstream media certainly doesn't.
[02:41:47.889 --> 02:41:52.113]  No, and now they've got the new election laws that have come in to where you really can't.
[02:41:52.254 --> 02:41:54.055]  It's becoming very, very difficult.
[02:41:54.155 --> 02:41:56.758]  So, hey, I sure thank you for the call, Brooke.
[02:41:56.838 --> 02:41:57.719]  Oh, thank you, Erskine.
[02:41:57.779 --> 02:41:59.541]  I think you're doing a great job.
[02:42:00.327 --> 02:42:00.948]  Thank you, sir.
[02:42:01.528 --> 02:42:03.710]  From Tucson, Arizona.
[02:42:03.790 --> 02:42:05.471]  Actually, this is out of the Boston Globe.
[02:42:06.572 --> 02:42:07.552]  Dateline Washington.
[02:42:07.953 --> 02:42:20.362]  Large numbers of Americans say that they would probably ignore official instructions for how to respond to a terrorist attack involving radiological dirty bombs or smallpox, according to a new study.
[02:42:21.003 --> 02:42:27.948]  Most public health plans created in the three years since September 11th attacks assume that the public would obey instructions
[02:42:28.726 --> 02:42:42.012]  To, well, let's say, for example, stay inside whatever shelter that they are during an airborne contamination attack, or to report to a central place to receive a vaccination shot should a disease outbreak occur.
[02:42:42.652 --> 02:42:57.539]  But the first major study of likely public behavior in the event of a terrorist attack calls into question the assumption that citing conflicting obligations such as responsibilities to family members and a distrust of public pronouncements
[02:42:58.251 --> 02:43:03.795]  If planners don't adjust to that reality, there can be unnecessary deaths, the study says.
[02:43:04.315 --> 02:43:19.525]  The study conducted by the New York Academy of Medicine Center of the Advancement of Collaborative Studies in Health found that 60% of Americans would disregard instructions to go to a public vaccination site in a smallpox outbreak.
[02:43:20.846 --> 02:43:26.510]  40% said they wouldn't stay inside an undamaged building other than their home after a dirty bomb went off.
[02:43:27.725 --> 02:43:32.650]  It's not that the rest of the people want to be uncooperative, said lead investigator Roz Lasker.
[02:43:33.110 --> 02:43:38.155]  The problem is the current plans unwittingly put them in extremely difficult decision-making predicaments.
[02:43:38.795 --> 02:43:49.005]  So even if first responders work out all of the challenging logistics, far fewer people would be protected than planners want or the public deserves.
[02:43:49.045 --> 02:43:52.328]  For example, parents may disregard dangers, go out in the open,
[02:43:53.294 --> 02:43:54.614]  Amen to the American people.
[02:43:54.694 --> 02:43:57.935]  You holler wolf, you holler wolf, you holler wolf, and nobody's going to buy what you're saying.
[02:44:20.572 --> 02:44:24.513]  Mr. Homeland Security, you just keep hollering wolf.
[02:44:25.353 --> 02:44:34.755]  They're talking about people may refuse to get smallpox shots because they fear mingling with crowds, are suspicious about the vaccine, and don't want to endanger family members.
[02:44:35.235 --> 02:44:36.136]  You betcha.
[02:44:36.536 --> 02:44:38.156]  A lot of people are that way.
[02:44:38.716 --> 02:44:40.457]  Let's talk about what happened to people.
[02:44:40.677 --> 02:44:42.397]  The aftermath of Hurricane Charlie.
[02:44:43.632 --> 02:44:48.694]  They set up new world detention refugee camps and weapons-toting guards.
[02:44:49.334 --> 02:44:53.236]  Inside the border of the zone is the land that doesn't work anymore.
[02:44:53.816 --> 02:44:57.617]  In the land that doesn't work anymore, something else happened.
[02:44:58.238 --> 02:45:01.659]  The electric, the phone, the gas, the water didn't work.
[02:45:02.079 --> 02:45:05.220]  Camps were surrounded with barbed wire, with razor wire.
[02:45:05.661 --> 02:45:10.202]  Wealthy Republican areas, they were restored within 36 hours.
[02:45:11.003 --> 02:45:11.723]  In these camps,
[02:45:12.359 --> 02:45:22.147]  Armed National Guard troops, M16 rifles, full kits, virtually guarding the wealthy Republican areas to keep the rabble out.
[02:45:22.608 --> 02:45:34.658]  However, in the other areas, the refugee camps, they were guarded by National Guard and full combat gear, M16 rifles and armored vehicles.
[02:45:35.405 --> 02:45:36.526]  You had checkpoints.
[02:45:36.766 --> 02:45:38.288]  They were in military fatigues.
[02:45:38.588 --> 02:45:40.289]  They weren't letting the people out.
[02:45:40.850 --> 02:45:42.911]  It was not to protect the people.
[02:45:42.952 --> 02:45:48.216]  It was to keep them in, keep them away from the Republican areas, the wealthy enclaves.
[02:45:49.157 --> 02:45:53.280]  So relief has now become militarized with a two-fold purpose.
[02:45:53.320 --> 02:46:01.047]  Number one, to build shelters to house the riffraff and also to control the riffraff, control their movements, establish border checkpoints.
[02:46:01.707 --> 02:46:03.329]  If you had a vehicle that worked,
[02:46:03.835 --> 02:46:10.204]  You can bring it if you're part of the rabble and it actually worked, but you were conscripted into volunteering.
[02:46:10.524 --> 02:46:16.792]  In other words, you're going to use your vehicle to lug around water or fetch and carry or pay for your upkeep.
[02:46:17.413 --> 02:46:20.758]  This is what happened unless you had a special FEMA pass.
[02:46:21.698 --> 02:46:24.821]  Now, Porter Goss lived on Sandsville Island.
[02:46:25.301 --> 02:46:31.586]  They were able to get all of their water, electric, everything back on very, very quickly.
[02:46:31.646 --> 02:46:33.608]  He just made a couple of phone calls.
[02:46:34.329 --> 02:46:38.252]  The other thing that people noticed, your credit cards were useless.
[02:46:38.572 --> 02:46:39.713]  Credit cards were useless.
[02:46:39.973 --> 02:46:41.655]  There was no electricity.
[02:46:41.955 --> 02:46:44.677]  This is in Florida right after Charlie.
[02:46:45.158 --> 02:46:46.419]  Cash became king.
[02:46:46.859 --> 02:46:50.042]  They weren't allowing you to leave their detention camps.
[02:46:50.996 --> 02:46:57.481]  Remember, over $90 billion under the Bush-Cheney regime was spent on domestic security measures.
[02:46:58.282 --> 02:46:59.763]  And this is what they've come up with.
[02:47:00.364 --> 02:47:03.706]  If you can't show ID, you can't pass one of the checkpoints.
[02:47:04.847 --> 02:47:06.629]  So, this is what's happened.
[02:47:07.710 --> 02:47:11.112]  This is what's happened when they have a problem like this.
[02:47:11.453 --> 02:47:16.757]  The free speech zones for the Republican National Convention, 18 miles away from New York City.
[02:47:17.558 --> 02:47:18.959]  I mean, the free speech zones.
[02:47:19.139 --> 02:47:22.842]  That's the only place where Americans can talk freely inside a free speech zone?
[02:47:23.222 --> 02:47:25.684]  Let's hope it hasn't come to that in America.
[02:47:26.284 --> 02:47:31.348]  And let's hope they do a little bit better job than they did after Charlie.
[02:47:32.328 --> 02:47:33.890]  Quote of the week, Adolf Hitler.
[02:47:34.250 --> 02:47:37.632]  What good fortune it is for governments that the people do not think.
[02:47:38.433 --> 02:47:44.477]  We strip the people of their rights in the name of the security of the state and the majority of the people will agree with the leader in so doing.
[02:47:44.917 --> 02:47:45.878]  Herman Goring.
[02:47:46.644 --> 02:47:48.507]  Is that what we've come to in America?
[02:47:49.048 --> 02:47:50.270]  Let's hope not.

[02:52:10.074 --> 02:52:13.215]  How'd they come up with Skull and Bones Bush, Skull and Bones Kerry?
[02:52:13.235 --> 02:52:14.056]  Of course it's staged.
[02:52:14.096 --> 02:52:15.456]  We talked about a lot of things today.
[02:52:15.476 --> 02:52:18.638]  We talked about what we can do specifically.
[02:52:19.458 --> 02:52:24.741]  Hey, I want to thank the callers because you gave us some terrific ideas and terrific things to think about.
[02:52:25.041 --> 02:52:26.742]  Let's go immediately to Ron in New York.
[02:52:27.082 --> 02:52:27.543]  Hi, Ron.
[02:52:27.583 --> 02:52:30.024]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[02:52:30.644 --> 02:52:31.265]  Hi, sir.
[02:52:31.325 --> 02:52:44.084]  What is your take on the 501c3 church and what would you call or alluded to before that have they really sold their very souls to the government and are no longer obeying God's scripture in the Bible?
[02:52:44.998 --> 02:52:55.364]  Well, personally, I think the 501c3 church has made a big mistake because I believe in rendering to Caesar what is Caesar's, but I don't think the church is part of Caesar's.
[02:52:55.504 --> 02:53:07.671]  And so I think that when they accept that, then they become one with the government and they start kowtowing to the government way of doing things and then it becomes more of a governmental church.
[02:53:07.771 --> 02:53:09.732]  I believe in separation of church and state.
[02:53:10.052 --> 02:53:10.912]  Are they doing this?
[02:53:11.012 --> 02:53:11.252]  Are they...
[02:53:13.078 --> 02:53:19.482]  Agreeing with all of these policies that are clearly New World Order, One World Government?
[02:53:19.522 --> 02:53:20.323]  No, not all.
[02:53:20.363 --> 02:53:21.804]  Fear out of ignorance or what?
[02:53:22.844 --> 02:53:33.832]  Not all churches, but a lot of them are doing some of this agreement with some of the New World Order because you've got to figure that you've got a lot of the newer Bibles that are coming out.
[02:53:33.872 --> 02:53:41.897]  I don't want to get on the religious tract here, but a lot of the newer Bibles that are coming out are coming out of the Oxford University Press in Oxford, England.
[02:53:42.532 --> 02:53:45.915]  And the Oxford University Press is owned by the Rothschilds.
[02:53:46.315 --> 02:53:51.720]  Now, excuse me, what's the Rothschilds doing in the Bible publishing business?
[02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.882]  And the fact of the matter is they are distorting things.
[02:53:54.962 --> 02:53:59.386]  And that's what's happened to a lot of churches in America where they've been distorting things.
[02:53:59.486 --> 02:54:02.228]  And a lot of them have flat out sold out.
[02:54:02.468 --> 02:54:03.209]  They know better.
[02:54:03.349 --> 02:54:04.390]  They have sold out.
[02:54:04.650 --> 02:54:07.633]  There's got to be a special place in hell for people who do that.
[02:54:07.793 --> 02:54:09.474]  And doesn't this address it, Erskine?
[02:54:09.674 --> 02:54:10.795]  It's Jeremiah 6...
[02:54:12.199 --> 02:54:12.799]  Verse 13.
[02:54:12.899 --> 02:54:19.523]  From the least to the greatest, all are greedy for gain, prophets and priests alike.
[02:54:20.023 --> 02:54:21.304]  All practice deceit.
[02:54:21.604 --> 02:54:22.184]  And here it is.
[02:54:22.584 --> 02:54:26.206]  They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious.
[02:54:26.686 --> 02:54:29.508]  Peace, peace, they say, when there is no peace.
[02:54:29.948 --> 02:54:32.129]  Are they ashamed of their loathsome conduct?
[02:54:32.209 --> 02:54:32.529]  No.
[02:54:32.849 --> 02:54:33.990]  They have no shame at all.
[02:54:34.410 --> 02:54:36.091]  They do not even know how to blush.
[02:54:36.571 --> 02:54:38.452]  So they will fall among the fallen.
[02:54:38.905 --> 02:54:42.328]  They will be brought down when I punish them, says the Lord.
[02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:44.070]  Absolutely.
[02:54:44.130 --> 02:54:48.574]  And when you're looking at that, what was the one time that Jesus really got upset?
[02:54:48.614 --> 02:54:51.116]  That was when he threw the money changers out.
[02:54:51.797 --> 02:54:54.059]  That was the one time he really got upset.
[02:54:54.139 --> 02:54:57.422]  And that quote about the peace, peace.
[02:54:58.022 --> 02:54:58.483]  And you hear...
[02:54:59.221 --> 02:55:05.546]  Peace through war, peace through strength, peace through this, this, and this, and you're doing the same thing?
[02:55:05.626 --> 02:55:14.393]  I mean, I'm not one of these who's a Bible thumper, but it's just as evident to me as the palm of your hand.
[02:55:14.493 --> 02:55:20.498]  I mean, it's right there, and it was said 2,000 years ago, and it's good today.
[02:55:20.758 --> 02:55:21.078]  Amen.
[02:55:21.118 --> 02:55:23.619]  So you better pay a little bit of attention to it.
[02:55:23.659 --> 02:55:28.901]  Whether you're a Christian or not, look at some of the things that are written there because they're rules and guides.
[02:55:28.921 --> 02:55:37.464]  That's one of the things that upset me about taking the Bible out of school because even if you're not Christian, there are precepts that you need to live by.
[02:55:37.524 --> 02:55:40.666]  There are certain precepts that people just aren't getting.
[02:55:40.986 --> 02:55:45.728]  It's called civilization, ladies and gentlemen, and we're not civilized anymore.
[02:55:45.928 --> 02:55:46.768]  God bless you, sir.
[02:55:47.762 --> 02:55:48.522]  Thank you, Ron.
