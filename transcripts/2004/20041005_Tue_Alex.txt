[00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:06.550]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.271]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.991 --> 00:00:10.112]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.752 --> 00:00:11.572]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:13.193]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:17.555]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.055 --> 00:00:22.137]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:51.407 --> 00:01:04.433]  From Lazarus he came with a big ragtag band to bring a revolution.
[00:01:04.513 --> 00:01:09.015]  Some would make him king, others couldn't stand that.
[00:01:10.615 --> 00:01:16.458]  The cross was a solution, but he rose again.
[00:01:18.415 --> 00:01:20.216]  Wise men follow him.
[00:01:21.017 --> 00:01:22.898]  He roams again.
[00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.440]  Wise men follow him.
[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.282]  Thank God for the renegades.
[00:01:31.082 --> 00:01:33.324]  And the life they lead.
[00:01:33.744 --> 00:01:38.266]  For the head of their trade.
[00:01:38.867 --> 00:01:44.710]  Without the renegades, Lord knows where we'll be.
[00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:53.392]  When it comes to heroes, Renegades are mine.
[00:01:54.352 --> 00:02:10.919]  They railed against the crown, Another ragtag band, Declaring independence.
[00:02:17.364 --> 00:02:21.846]  Thanks to the renegades, we're free today.
[00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.356]  What if there's a hero who's ready to fight?
[00:03:23.448 --> 00:03:29.290]  Where are the renegades in the world today?
[00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.612]  Who are the renegades in the world today?
[00:03:34.772 --> 00:03:41.835]  Thank God for the renegades and the lives they lead.
[00:03:42.095 --> 00:03:45.976]  Far ahead of their time.
[00:03:46.057 --> 00:03:52.719]  Without the renegades, Lord knows where
[00:03:54.921 --> 00:03:59.845]  When it comes to heroes, Renegades are mine.
[00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:05.910]  When it comes to heroes, Renegades are mine.
[00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:24.732]  Alright ladies and gentlemen it is of course Tuesday the fifth day of October 2004.
[00:04:25.693 --> 00:04:27.294]  I'm Alex Jones your host.
[00:04:27.955 --> 00:04:34.399]  A ton of vital news and information coming up in the next two hours and 55 minutes 20 seconds.
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:42.425]  In the second hour we're going to delve into the Central Texas toll road plan and how that's actually a national model.
[00:04:44.306 --> 00:04:48.209]  6,000 miles of toll roads when the nation has
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.141]  7,000 miles of toll roads, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:52.821 --> 00:04:57.344]  They're racing ahead with it, despite the fact that 90 plus percent of Central Texans are against it.
[00:04:57.685 --> 00:04:59.206]  A bunch of international news as well.
[00:04:59.266 --> 00:04:59.686]  Stay with us.
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.405]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.826 --> 00:05:14.050]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:21.337]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.717 --> 00:05:27.823]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.843 --> 00:05:29.164]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.504 --> 00:05:32.448]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:05:32.608 --> 00:05:34.630]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:05:34.931 --> 00:05:42.179]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.864]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[00:06:02.668 --> 00:06:07.190]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.612]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:06:11.912 --> 00:06:12.452]  We listened.
[00:06:12.772 --> 00:06:17.755]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:06:18.035 --> 00:06:18.515]  We listened.
[00:06:18.895 --> 00:06:21.936]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:06:22.377 --> 00:06:22.877]  We listened.
[00:06:23.337 --> 00:06:27.419]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:28.279]  We listened.
[00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:33.861]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:35.642]  Again, we listened.
[00:06:36.002 --> 00:06:37.582]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[00:06:37.762 --> 00:06:43.385]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:06:43.765 --> 00:06:44.565]  Get the Berkey Light!
[00:06:45.452 --> 00:06:48.256]  The American Water Filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:06:49.778 --> 00:06:51.480]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:07.836]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:07:08.177 --> 00:07:09.538]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:07:09.738 --> 00:07:11.960]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.182]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:07:14.462 --> 00:07:19.387]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:07:19.727 --> 00:07:23.771]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:07:24.011 --> 00:07:25.792]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:07:25.852 --> 00:07:36.516]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:07:36.656 --> 00:07:38.556]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[00:07:55.083 --> 00:07:55.804]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:07:55.824 --> 00:08:07.871]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.192 --> 00:08:19.097]  Last week, our new CIA Director, Horder Gosch, came out and nominated
[00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:34.909]  somebody to be his deputy and it turned out that in the mid-1980s this guy had to resign and leave the Central Intelligence Agency because he was caught shoplifting in the CIA gift shop.
[00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:47.758]  Now at the time the CIA went to the police and got the police to drop the charges but he had to leave the CIA and now that it's come out that this guy is a shoplifter
[00:08:49.006 --> 00:08:53.689]  Porter Goss doesn't care and still wants him to be your new Deputy Director.
[00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:00.033]  And we have that story posted on PrisonPlanet.com and of course InfoWars.com.
[00:09:01.954 --> 00:09:06.057]  Now why am I starting the broadcast with that story, which I'll detail more later?
[00:09:07.758 --> 00:09:16.603]  Well, because the head of the Total Information Awareness Network that was never cancelled and he's still running it, they've just changed the name, is Admiral Poindexter.
[00:09:17.478 --> 00:09:18.960]  Five-time convicted felon.
[00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:27.808]  The guy who came out with the computer software for the face scanning, another felon.
[00:09:28.749 --> 00:09:30.251]  Connected to drug cartels.
[00:09:31.472 --> 00:09:37.598]  Then we find out the company that sold the Matrix technology for the Echelon system at the state level.
[00:09:37.738 --> 00:09:38.639]  Same background.
[00:09:40.393 --> 00:09:53.979]  In fact, more often than not, the majority of the time, people running the intelligence agencies at state and federal level are convicted or admitted criminals.
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.782]  Stealing, drug dealing, lying to Congress.
[00:10:01.852 --> 00:10:29.174]  It goes on and on and on and on, and so now why would they want somebody who's a kleptomaniac, who went to counseling for being a kleptomaniac, as one of the top positions in the CIA, it's arguably the number two or number three position, over all of its financial activities, why would you put an admitted shoplifter, who fled no contest,
[00:10:30.029 --> 00:10:31.629]  And you've got a fur to judification.
[00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:36.051]  Why would you have someone who's an admitted shoplifter?
[00:10:36.331 --> 00:10:43.353]  You know, if you're an admitted shoplifter, you can't get a job working at 7-Eleven or Walmart or at Kroger.
[00:10:45.453 --> 00:10:55.016]  But if you're an admitted shoplifter, you get to run the giant, tens of billions of dollars a year, public budget of the CIA, not to mention all their secret budgets.
[00:10:56.548 --> 00:10:58.789]  Oh no, the CIA doesn't deal drugs.
[00:10:58.889 --> 00:11:01.709]  Oh no, the CIA isn't involved in white slavery.
[00:11:02.029 --> 00:11:04.850]  Oh no, the CIA isn't involved in political assassination.
[00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.911]  Well, Alex, these are the type of people we need!
[00:11:08.311 --> 00:11:10.771]  Men who have a taste for such things!
[00:11:11.211 --> 00:11:13.772]  You people out there just don't get it!
[00:11:17.333 --> 00:11:21.994]  So, again, I'm extreme because I'm against kleptomaniacs running the CIA.
[00:11:24.457 --> 00:11:30.560]  And then, of course, we've got, well, it's perfect for this kleptocracy.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.481]  I forget who coined that term.
[00:11:32.761 --> 00:11:38.223]  Instead of a plutocracy or an oligarchy, we have a kleptocracy.
[00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:43.726]  That's how Mexico's been described, the kleptocracy, where they just rob and rule over their people.
[00:11:44.066 --> 00:11:53.030]  I would describe North Korea as a kleptocracy, a government run by thieves, compulsive thieves,
[00:11:54.372 --> 00:11:57.233]  And that's what all this security and this whole New World Order is about.
[00:11:59.434 --> 00:12:03.036]  Of course, forget Goss's new deputy who he's defending.
[00:12:03.356 --> 00:12:05.097]  So what if he's a kleptomaniac?
[00:12:05.257 --> 00:12:05.878]  Shut up!
[00:12:06.238 --> 00:12:08.059]  You know what Al Qaeda to get you, do ya?
[00:12:09.419 --> 00:12:12.961]  You gotta have somebody in there over the money who knows how to work with us.
[00:12:15.502 --> 00:12:19.124]  That's a big part of this tyranny is just these fat cats sitting over the cash machines.
[00:12:19.444 --> 00:12:23.026]  Sitting over these bottomless pits of money.
[00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:25.791]  You're in my money.
[00:12:25.971 --> 00:12:26.392]  Our money.
[00:12:29.094 --> 00:12:37.642]  So this is the type of classic stuff that we deal with on a daily basis.
[00:12:37.682 --> 00:12:40.144]  This is the new world order.
[00:12:40.165 --> 00:12:42.627]  And then we look at Porter Goss, our new CIA director.
[00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:54.594]  And they want him to be the new domestic head of this new super agency with our new national ID cards and the checkpoints on all the roads and the new National Compulsory Service and the Patriot Act too.
[00:12:54.614 --> 00:12:58.475]  Porter Goss, oh this secret spy for decades no one knew.
[00:12:58.495 --> 00:13:01.176]  Now he races to the head job at the CIA.
[00:13:01.236 --> 00:13:02.637]  It's like Bush Senior.
[00:13:02.677 --> 00:13:11.060]  They claim in the mid-1970s that he just magically became head of the CIA and he didn't have any prior
[00:13:12.153 --> 00:13:14.114]  Credentials for that are experience.
[00:13:14.154 --> 00:13:15.155]  Never worked there before.
[00:13:15.515 --> 00:13:29.024]  No, it's just an absolute documented fact that he was over the CIA detail in Dallas, Texas back in 1963 and over the Cuban operations in Cuba and over the Bay of Pigs and the rest of it.
[00:13:30.465 --> 00:13:31.405]  Same thing with Goss.
[00:13:31.425 --> 00:13:32.386]  He just comes out of nowhere.
[00:13:32.486 --> 00:13:34.467]  Oh, I've been a secret spy for many years.
[00:13:34.988 --> 00:13:36.469]  Okay, we'll make you the director.
[00:13:36.509 --> 00:13:38.470]  You've been in Congress this whole time.
[00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:39.731]  Oh, you met with the
[00:13:40.945 --> 00:14:01.862]  Head of Pakistani Intelligence, the General, who admittedly wired $100,000 to one of the supposed hijackers, one of the decoys, Mohammed Adda, and you just so happen to be having breakfast at 8.30 in the morning at the Capitol with Porter Goss and the other Senate head of the Intelligence Committees, up there together having a luscious breakfast in the
[00:14:02.648 --> 00:14:14.115]  The New York Times and Washington Post reported that Ian walked the aid and said the second tower has been hit in Gosford and said, we know, continued eating his eggies.
[00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:16.856]  And at the same time, Bush Sr.
[00:14:16.876 --> 00:14:17.797]  is there in D.C.
[00:14:17.877 --> 00:14:30.164]  at the Ritz-Carlton at a Carlyle Group executive meeting at the same table with the head of the Bin Laden family, that's the London Guardian Associated Press, having some succulent platters as well.
[00:14:31.767 --> 00:14:43.158]  And then meanwhile, that very time, you have the CIA running drills of hijacked jets flying into the World Trade Center Pentagon, just exactly at that very time, magically, at 8.30 in the morning.
[00:14:43.198 --> 00:14:53.067]  And, of course, Marvin Bush, the youngest of the George Herbert Walker's brood, is running security at the World Trade Center complex.
[00:14:53.849 --> 00:15:04.279]  Got the contract for security, and of course, hired John O'Neill, former Deputy Director of Counterterrorism, number two man at the FBI, just happened to hire him.
[00:15:04.319 --> 00:15:07.702]  He'd been a critic of how they were, quote, going to let bin Laden attack the U.S.
[00:15:07.742 --> 00:15:08.883]  as a pretext to get oil.
[00:15:09.304 --> 00:15:12.327]  Told major British and French newspapers that one month before he died.
[00:15:12.347 --> 00:15:16.631]  But then he thought he got this great deal, his head of security at the World Trade Center, got hired by Marvin.
[00:15:17.191 --> 00:15:18.351]  The bad thing happened to him.
[00:15:18.371 --> 00:15:20.212]  Of course, Marvin wasn't at work that day.
[00:15:20.552 --> 00:15:24.992]  Oh, the last day of his contract, of the two-year contract, was September 11th, by the way.
[00:15:25.012 --> 00:15:26.453]  So he was done with his contract that day.
[00:15:26.473 --> 00:15:27.453]  Ha ha ha!
[00:15:28.173 --> 00:15:43.676]  And at the very same time, we have other things going on that day, like the Boston Airport, where the president's uncle had the contract for security there.
[00:15:44.336 --> 00:15:45.436]  That's Associated Press.
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.201]  Again, there's hundreds of these.
[00:15:48.441 --> 00:15:49.381]  I'm not exaggerating.
[00:15:49.461 --> 00:15:55.304]  Hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds.
[00:15:55.344 --> 00:16:00.566]  At least 600 smoking guns and red flags that totally prove who was behind 9-11.
[00:16:00.586 --> 00:16:05.508]  You'd have to be the wildest conspiracy theorist in the world to believe their official story.
[00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:13.791]  And so Porter Goss is now hiring kleptomaniacs to run the financial systems of the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:16:16.377 --> 00:16:24.581]  So, if you want to be a governor, you've got to say that you admire dictators like Hitler, and that you love Kurt Voltheim the Nazi, and that you hate black people.
[00:16:24.601 --> 00:16:26.982]  That's how you get an ADL endorsement.
[00:16:27.643 --> 00:16:31.104]  And to run the financial systems of the CIA, you have to be a kleptomaniac.
[00:16:31.124 --> 00:16:44.351]  So, uh, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, and you've got to be a five-time convicted felon to run the NSA spy system on the American people, and, uh, to, uh,
[00:16:46.078 --> 00:16:49.101]  Just a very wonderful system is basically all I'm saying here.
[00:16:49.161 --> 00:16:50.982]  Here's United Press International.
[00:16:52.083 --> 00:16:55.847]  American Bar Association blasts extradition to torture nations.
[00:16:56.007 --> 00:16:56.187]  Why?
[00:16:56.227 --> 00:16:58.790]  We've been blasting this for three years.
[00:17:00.151 --> 00:17:12.402]  The American Bar Association said Thursday, it objected strongly to House legislation allowing terror suspects, including American citizens, to be sent to countries that use torture.
[00:17:13.524 --> 00:17:30.010]  In a statement, the American Bar Association said it objects strongly to the inclusion of provisions authorizing extraordinary retention in the House leadership's bill that purports to implement the 9-11 Commission's recommendations.
[00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:42.735]  The Washington Post said the Bush administration is supporting the provision introduced by House Speaker Dennard Hastert, a Republican Illinois, but the ABA said the provisions would permit
[00:17:43.653 --> 00:17:48.975]  Secretly transferring terrorist suspects to foreign countries known to use torture in interrogating prisoners.
[00:17:49.335 --> 00:17:57.538]  Extraordinary retention not only violates all basic humanitarian and human rights standards, but violates U.S.
[00:17:57.598 --> 00:17:59.519]  treaty obligations, which make clear the U.S.
[00:17:59.539 --> 00:18:08.622]  government cannot avoid its obligations under international law by having other nations conduct unlawful interrogations in its stead.
[00:18:09.278 --> 00:18:15.201]  The inclusion also works to undermine the moral leadership in the eyes of the rest of the world, the ABA said.
[00:18:16.061 --> 00:18:36.891]  Two and a half years ago, there was an article in the Washington Post where the CIA Section Chief for Central Asia bragged that they were shipping terror suspects to Jordan and Egypt, quote, where they could be tortured under our supervision and where their children and wives can be threatened.
[00:18:38.613 --> 00:18:42.015]  And those are paraphrases, but I believe actual quotes.
[00:18:42.035 --> 00:18:45.736]  I've got a pretty good memory and I read that article probably 30 times on air.
[00:18:46.577 --> 00:18:47.617]  But it's on the website.
[00:18:47.637 --> 00:18:52.339]  It's in the torture archive of PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[00:18:52.999 --> 00:18:54.180]  It's in a couple of my films.
[00:18:55.638 --> 00:18:59.959]  And, uh, they just, uh, came right out and said, we're torturing and living daylights out of people.
[00:19:00.319 --> 00:19:03.540]  Why, Rumsfeld got up a few years ago on TV and said, we're torturing people.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.260]  Ha, ha, ha.
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.560]  You know, isn't it great?
[00:19:05.581 --> 00:19:06.901]  Let's torture, torture, torture.
[00:19:06.921 --> 00:19:22.205]  Of course, now you learn, and many mainstream reporters are now reading the bill, finally, Patriot Act 2 reintroduced, along with a national ID card on top of it, uh, that it says that any crime, any misdemeanor, you can be disappeared and tortured.
[00:19:22.765 --> 00:19:23.765]  Everything's terrorism.
[00:19:24.548 --> 00:19:32.130]  And you can have your citizenship stripped and shipped to Guantanamo Bay in Cuba or anywhere else they wish for torture.
[00:19:35.131 --> 00:19:37.152]  Now we have mainstream news articles on that today.
[00:19:37.192 --> 00:19:48.955]  I guess I'll read them just because it's old news for you but it's mainstream news now and so we might as well just go ahead and read it from the Associated Press and from CNET News and everywhere else what we've known for a long time.
[00:19:49.995 --> 00:19:53.116]  So now the Patriot Act II that didn't exist does exist
[00:19:53.823 --> 00:19:56.425]  and is right out in the open in everyone's face.
[00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:57.946]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:57.966 --> 00:19:58.687]  Please stay with us.
[00:19:59.027 --> 00:20:00.789]  PresentPlanet.tv is the website.

[00:21:08.535 --> 00:21:09.336]  Read the labels.

[00:22:02.582 --> 00:22:04.363]  Jack Brownring for Midas Resources.
[00:22:04.863 --> 00:22:08.304]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[00:22:08.784 --> 00:22:09.444]  Let's update.
[00:22:09.984 --> 00:22:14.725]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[00:22:15.345 --> 00:22:17.706]  The NASDAQ in that same time frame is flat.
[00:22:18.473 --> 00:22:19.434]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[00:22:19.454 --> 00:22:21.776]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[00:22:22.297 --> 00:22:23.197]  Today, the U.S.
[00:22:23.237 --> 00:22:25.460]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.381]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:22:27.962 --> 00:22:29.944]  January of 2002, gold spot was $2.83.
[00:22:31.305 --> 00:22:36.169]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:37.911]  Gold is moving.
[00:22:38.171 --> 00:22:39.332]  Equities are treading water.
[00:22:39.733 --> 00:22:42.275]  There's little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[00:22:42.893 --> 00:22:44.274]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[00:22:44.715 --> 00:22:46.436]  Physical possession, private gold.
[00:22:46.837 --> 00:22:48.819]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[00:22:49.219 --> 00:22:51.341]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[00:22:53.503 --> 00:22:55.665]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.
[00:22:56.045 --> 00:22:56.266]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.928 --> 00:23:03.969]  You and your family members gaining enough minerals in the daily diet?
[00:23:04.329 --> 00:23:06.870]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:14.152]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[00:23:14.352 --> 00:23:17.633]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[00:23:17.873 --> 00:23:19.914]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[00:23:20.254 --> 00:23:28.076]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[00:23:28.356 --> 00:23:29.617]  Either way, why chance it?
[00:23:29.717 --> 00:23:39.684]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call to Sea Minerals at 877-835-5555 and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost to the immune system.

[00:23:44.327 --> 00:23:49.050]  Reclaim that youthful, energetic feeling and restore your good health with the help of minerals from the sea.
[00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:51.051]  Call Sea Minerals today, toll-free, 877-835-5555.
[00:23:51.071 --> 00:23:51.712]  That's 877-835-5555 or visit
[00:23:58.516 --> 00:24:10.144]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:10.724 --> 00:24:13.726]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:19.570]  Look around you.
[00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:20.711]  Look at the atmosphere.
[00:24:22.052 --> 00:24:23.233]  A feeling of oppression.
[00:24:23.273 --> 00:24:24.774]  The government wants to intimidate you.
[00:24:25.828 --> 00:24:28.950]  Now their surveillance blimps are over major U.S.
[00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:29.291]  cities.
[00:24:29.351 --> 00:24:33.374]  They're going to be tethered over every U.S.
[00:24:33.474 --> 00:24:33.814]  city.
[00:24:35.976 --> 00:24:39.859]  And meanwhile, I saw an article yesterday where guess what?
[00:24:39.899 --> 00:24:45.203]  They're going to mount microwave guns on these blimps.
[00:24:46.223 --> 00:24:53.529]  So they're not just going to be flying around looking through your walls, they're going to be huge weapons platforms to fry you like a bug.
[00:24:55.228 --> 00:25:12.463]  Now again, imagine a science fiction movie 20 years ago, where you thumb scan to buy and sell, where everything you do is spied on, where high school students who threaten teachers verbally are charged under terrorism, where torture is good, where they tell you mercury is nutritious.
[00:25:12.843 --> 00:25:15.085]  I ought to make a movie that's like a docudrama.
[00:25:15.829 --> 00:25:25.057]  A spoof science fiction movie where Mercury is delicious, reporting your parents for crimes is wholesome, and a black ski mask on your public officials is good.
[00:25:25.077 --> 00:25:38.989]  How to make a film where the city councils wear a black mask and we've all got like little microchips in our brains and then in a few years when it all comes true, people go, oh, that was a fortuitous film.
[00:25:39.989 --> 00:25:42.852]  Very far-reaching in its vision.
[00:25:43.775 --> 00:25:44.656]  There's another article.
[00:25:44.936 --> 00:25:45.877]  Declan McCullough.
[00:25:46.677 --> 00:25:48.458]  This is for CNET News.
[00:25:48.939 --> 00:25:51.180]  National IDs for everybody.
[00:25:51.241 --> 00:25:54.783]  And he goes through what is now public knowledge.
[00:25:55.163 --> 00:26:00.147]  Also, oil sets record on lengthy supply outage.
[00:26:00.607 --> 00:26:03.429]  So now it's $51 a barrel.
[00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:07.553]  And analysts say, well, you may be paying $6 a gallon for gas here in a few years.
[00:26:07.573 --> 00:26:08.633]  This is just the beginning.
[00:26:09.214 --> 00:26:13.537]  There's more oil than ever, but hey, you're slaves and you're pretty dumbed down, so why not rape you?
[00:26:14.625 --> 00:26:17.327]  And here's another article about the microwave guns.
[00:26:18.088 --> 00:26:21.490]  They're not just for Iraqis, just like the sound cannons aren't just for Iraqis.
[00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.572]  I videotaped them pointing them at protesters in New York.
[00:26:25.313 --> 00:26:30.836]  Air Force looks at new microwave weapon and they want to mount them on aircraft.
[00:26:31.017 --> 00:26:33.038]  Yes, to deal with enemy ground troops.
[00:26:33.678 --> 00:26:37.181]  And of course they've already announced they're going to mount them to deal with the American people.
[00:26:38.504 --> 00:26:53.416]  The Air Force expects planes will be able to fire non-lethal microwave rays at enemy ground troops with the help of a new superconducting generator system developed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base after about 25 years of research.
[00:26:53.576 --> 00:26:55.718]  Sure, it's just now ready.
[00:26:56.218 --> 00:26:58.320]  Folks, they used microwaves in the first Gulf War.
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:05.306]  You'd see people totally fried, you know, popped like hot dogs you put in the microwave with their uniforms untouched.
[00:27:06.727 --> 00:27:07.007]  Heavy
[00:27:08.886 --> 00:27:15.588]  Generators have been a hurdle to the development of airborne microwave weapons which create a disabling burning sensation.
[00:27:16.188 --> 00:27:29.232]  Microwaves could be used to control large groups of enemy fighters without killing them or disable electronics dependent enemy weapons said Phillip Coit, Senior Advisor for the Center for Defense Information.
[00:27:29.652 --> 00:27:37.855]  The Air Force is preparing to award a $22 million contract to a private contractor to construct and demonstrate the new electrical generating system.
[00:27:39.517 --> 00:27:44.561]  And they're going to mount these on the blimps and fly around and, uh, well, you know, they're going to have to use them.
[00:27:45.201 --> 00:27:47.463]  Any weapon that isn't used is a useless weapon.
[00:27:47.483 --> 00:27:56.970]  Uh, Air Force Pursuing Anti-Matter Weapons Program was touted publicly, then became the official gag order.
[00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:59.592]  This is out of the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:28:00.792 --> 00:28:01.934]  And it says the U.S.
[00:28:02.014 --> 00:28:14.794]  Air Force is quietly spending millions of dollars, tri-billions, investigating ways to use a radical power source, antimatter, the eerie mirror of ordinary matter in future weapons.
[00:28:16.178 --> 00:28:28.721]  About five years ago, the European Union was begged by our government not to shoot antimatter particles through their new superconducting supercollider.
[00:28:29.222 --> 00:28:45.366]  And even before that, before they ever began building and then cancelled the Waxahachie Mega Collider up in northeastern Texas, it came out and a lot of top scientists said it could blow the Earth up!
[00:28:46.079 --> 00:28:49.602]  Or at least to cause the equivalent of a thousand hydrogen bombs.
[00:28:50.682 --> 00:28:52.544]  Or maybe one hydrogen bomb to go off.
[00:28:52.584 --> 00:28:58.548]  They weren't sure, but they were pretty sure it's very dangerous to be dealing with antimatter.
[00:28:58.568 --> 00:29:00.569]  Does that stop the globalists?
[00:29:00.629 --> 00:29:00.989]  No, no.
[00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:02.951]  These are public programs.
[00:29:02.991 --> 00:29:06.373]  Can you imagine what's secret down in the bowels of the shadow government?
[00:29:09.571 --> 00:29:14.735]  I shouldn't joke about this, but they'll probably have antimatter beams mounted on blimps to keep us safe here pretty quick.
[00:29:14.815 --> 00:29:15.776]  I'm being sarcastic now.
[00:29:16.376 --> 00:29:24.182]  The most powerful potential energy source presently thought to be available to humanity, antimatter is a term normally heard in science fiction films.
[00:29:24.862 --> 00:29:34.189]  Yeah, 50 years ago, it's 2004, folks, and TV shows whose heroes fly antimatter-powered spaceships into battle with antimatter guns.
[00:29:35.555 --> 00:29:37.156]  But antimatter itself isn't fiction.
[00:29:37.516 --> 00:29:43.100]  It actually exists and has been intensively studied by physicists since the 1930s.
[00:29:44.121 --> 00:29:46.763]  Yes, they're playing with antimatter as weapons.
[00:29:46.823 --> 00:29:48.024]  That's very safe.
[00:29:48.845 --> 00:29:49.805]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:52.347 --> 00:29:53.288]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.748 --> 00:29:55.349]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:58.952]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:32:56.921 --> 00:32:59.202]  We're going to open the phone lines up here.
[00:32:59.242 --> 00:33:12.628]  In a few minutes you want to get involved on air.
[00:33:12.648 --> 00:33:12.788]  1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231
[00:33:27.054 --> 00:33:37.500]  I was talking about how they're not just going to mount ground-penetrating radar on these new surveillance Homeland Security blimps to look through our walls, but microwave guns.
[00:33:38.681 --> 00:33:47.526]  There's more articles on that today out of the Associated Press, with the Air Force looking at these to control crowds and take care of us.
[00:33:47.606 --> 00:33:51.788]  I mean, this is freedom, having blimps floating around aiming microwave guns at us.
[00:33:51.868 --> 00:33:53.149]  I mean, that's what America's about.
[00:33:53.629 --> 00:33:55.150]  But the border stays wide open, of course.
[00:33:56.404 --> 00:34:05.508]  What do they have planned so horrible that they've got all these riot police and troops ready and giant FEMA camps admittedly built for our safety and security?
[00:34:05.528 --> 00:34:11.550]  They call them rest and relocation centers in England under the Civil Contingencies Plan.
[00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:12.851]  Same thing here.
[00:34:13.711 --> 00:34:18.473]  And then meanwhile, Air Force pursuing anti-matter weapons program was touted publicly.
[00:34:18.973 --> 00:34:20.554]  Then came official gag order.
[00:34:22.362 --> 00:34:34.172]  And the globalists argue that, well, we've got to develop all the latest, most deadly biological weapons, chemical weapons, radiological weapons, anti-matter weapons, because why, somebody else will!
[00:34:34.832 --> 00:34:44.160]  And we've got to be more evil and more ruthless than anyone else, because we're really the good guys, and so we've got to be more evil than evil to protect freedom and liberty.
[00:34:45.521 --> 00:34:50.025]  As if corrupt individuals won't use that power and abuse populations.
[00:34:50.777 --> 00:34:59.322]  And they push for world government to have a world government to stop all these rogue countries from developing chemical and biological and radiological weapons.
[00:34:59.782 --> 00:35:06.386]  Meanwhile, they're busy proliferating these 1950s era technologies to the third world.
[00:35:06.966 --> 00:35:12.909]  It's like the old western where the bad guy throws the gun down at the feet of the 13 year old kid and goes, Go ahead, kid.
[00:35:13.229 --> 00:35:14.250]  Pick up the gun.
[00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:15.250]  Pick it up.
[00:35:15.791 --> 00:35:17.792]  When the kid reaches for the gun, they blow him away.
[00:35:19.699 --> 00:35:23.522]  And then meanwhile endanger our whole planet by proliferating these weapons.
[00:35:23.963 --> 00:35:25.724]  So there's your daily analogy.
[00:35:27.006 --> 00:35:32.971]  But the problem with antimatter is, and this is public, you know, top physicists have said this,
[00:35:33.795 --> 00:35:35.157]  They don't know what'll happen with it!
[00:35:35.557 --> 00:35:56.799]  You start playing around with it, doing fish infusion, and you start, you know, sending it through these different magnetic containment facilities, and you start accelerating it, and superconducting super colliders, and slamming it into blocks of lead, and blocks of uranium, and blocks of iron, and slamming it into crystals,
[00:35:57.785 --> 00:36:19.897]  They just don't know what it's going to do, so they just go ahead and do it, and then they admit that it could cause massive explosions, it could blow up the Earth, it could blow up the entire solar system, it could create a giant black hole, or it could just explode with the power of a thousand hydrogen bombs.
[00:36:20.743 --> 00:36:21.944]  And the article continues.
[00:36:22.004 --> 00:36:27.707]  During the Cold War, the Air Force funded numerous scientific studies of the basic physics of antimatter.
[00:36:29.008 --> 00:36:35.051]  Within the knowledge gained, some Air Force insiders are beginning to think seriously about potential military uses.
[00:36:35.591 --> 00:36:37.232]  This is the declassified stuff now.
[00:36:37.552 --> 00:36:38.813]  Can you imagine what they've really got?
[00:36:39.153 --> 00:36:46.617]  For example, antimatter bombs, small enough to hold in one's hand, and antimatter engines for 24-7 surveillance aircraft.
[00:36:46.717 --> 00:36:47.037]  See?
[00:36:47.517 --> 00:36:48.418]  See the blimps!
[00:36:49.028 --> 00:36:49.328]  See?
[00:36:49.469 --> 00:36:49.949]  I knew it!
[00:36:50.049 --> 00:36:51.290]  It's a blimp connection!
[00:36:51.931 --> 00:37:00.738]  More cataclysmic possible uses include a new generation of super weapons, either pure antimatter bombs or antimatter-triggered nuclear weapons.
[00:37:01.463 --> 00:37:04.164]  The former wouldn't emit radioactive fallout.
[00:37:04.624 --> 00:37:19.091]  Another possibility is an antimatter-powered electromagnetic pulse weapons that could fry an enemy's electronic power grid and communications networks, leaving him literally in the dark and unable to operate his society and armed forces.
[00:37:19.831 --> 00:37:29.055]  Following an initial inquiry from the Chronicle this summer, the Air Force forbade its employees from publicly discussing the Antimatter Research Program.
[00:37:29.995 --> 00:37:35.579]  Still, details of the program appear in numerous Air Force documents distributed over the internet prior to the ban.
[00:37:35.959 --> 00:37:46.227]  These include an online, on March 2004, speech by Air Force official who, in effect, spilled the beans about Air Force high hopes for antimatter weapons.
[00:37:47.561 --> 00:38:02.044]  On March 24th, Kenneth Edwards, director of the Revolutionary Munitions Team at the Munitions Directorate at Egan Air Force Base in Florida, was keynote speaker at the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts conference in Arlington, Virginia.
[00:38:02.524 --> 00:38:09.906]  In that talk, Edwards discussed the potential use of a type of antimatter called positrons.
[00:38:10.926 --> 00:38:15.807]  Again, that's right out of science fiction movies, the positronic engines, folks.
[00:38:17.208 --> 00:38:33.172]  physicists have known about positrons or anti-electrons since the early 1930s when Caltech scientist Carl Anderson discovered a positron flying through a detector in his laboratory.
[00:38:33.232 --> 00:38:45.995]  The discovery and the latter discovery of antipositrons by Berkeley scientists in the 1950s upheld the 1920s theory of antimatter proposed by physicist Paul Dirac.
[00:38:47.063 --> 00:38:50.960]  By the way, folks, again, and then all these top scientists from then on up...
[00:38:51.670 --> 00:39:18.981]  It was the discovery of antimatter that made them think they could create nuclear weapons, atomic weapons than nuclear, hydrogen, and most of these scientists agree that playing with this is absolutely insane, especially slamming it into things at high speeds, which is exactly what causes a nuclear reaction with unstable materials, uranium, plutonium, and these guys have been caught, and admittedly, slamming antimatter into nuclear material.
[00:39:20.555 --> 00:39:43.662]  And by the way, they even admit, I remember 10 years ago seeing PBS documentaries where they've got these underground bases a mile under the ground where they sit there collecting antimatter that falls through space for some reason it stops at certain levels in the crust and they're able to scoop it up and grab it and then they run off with it and slam it into things and superconducting super colliders.
[00:39:46.278 --> 00:39:56.644]  Basically, we could all be sitting here a month from now, ten years from now, and it's just suddenly, we won't even have time for our nerve endings to feel the heat.
[00:39:57.204 --> 00:40:11.213]  It'll be a painless death, as the Earth is turned into discombobulated neurons, discombobulated little particles.
[00:40:12.693 --> 00:40:13.934]  Neurons, that's your brain.
[00:40:14.635 --> 00:40:15.275]  Electrons.
[00:40:16.398 --> 00:40:25.527]  And, you know, this is the Globalist, folks, building three dozen level four bioweapons labs, some of them already open, in places like Galveston.
[00:40:26.368 --> 00:40:34.296]  Admittedly, quote, producing thousands of gallons of liquid death, super viruses and bacteria that kill half the people it comes in contact with.
[00:40:35.203 --> 00:40:38.945]  Irreparably maims 90% of those that come in contact with it.
[00:40:38.985 --> 00:40:42.007]  If you don't die, you're maimed in almost every case.
[00:40:42.067 --> 00:40:50.772]  And this is how they deal with the threat of biological weapons as they run around arming the world and then saying global government's got to come into effect to keep us all safe.
[00:40:51.293 --> 00:40:59.798]  Meanwhile, the top globalists owning and running this whole system in their own publications and memoirs said their highest hope is to kill 80 to 95% of us.
[00:40:59.818 --> 00:41:02.920]  They're on complete, total, megalomaniacal power trips.
[00:41:05.001 --> 00:41:06.843]  And so this is why government's so arrogant.
[00:41:06.883 --> 00:41:09.886]  They're putting in the electronic voting machines over our voting.
[00:41:10.366 --> 00:41:12.108]  They're militarizing the police against us.
[00:41:12.128 --> 00:41:13.570]  They're building all these new prisons.
[00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:16.472]  They're training the young people that being a slave is good.
[00:41:16.492 --> 00:41:19.796]  Training them how to biometrically thumb scan to get their school lunches.
[00:41:20.136 --> 00:41:22.038]  How to wear ID badges around their necks.
[00:41:22.438 --> 00:41:34.447]  We're going into a total surveillance society, and now they're going to tether these microwave blimps to look through our walls and microwave gun us whenever they want, like we're little cockroaches in a rat maze.
[00:41:34.967 --> 00:41:46.456]  And meanwhile, they're building this giant world government and saying they're going to have a global one-child policy and forcibly inoculate us with DNA-altering vaccines and publicly poisoning us with the water supplies.
[00:41:46.996 --> 00:41:49.578]  I mean, do you like being in a giant laboratory experiment?
[00:41:50.504 --> 00:42:03.066]  And this whole thing, the globalists think they're invincible, this whole thing counts on cops and firemen and FBI agents and CIA officers going along with this, denying what's happening.
[00:42:04.372 --> 00:42:11.341]  You've got some that just keep their head down and know what's going on and are upset about what's happening and are holding this thing back to a certain degree.
[00:42:11.642 --> 00:42:15.867]  You've got the other group that are just dumbed down and go along to get along and don't know what's going on.
[00:42:15.887 --> 00:42:20.474]  And then you've got really two other groups, a group who knows what's going on,
[00:42:21.615 --> 00:42:32.804]  But has decided to go ahead and deny that it's horrible, and make excuses to themselves of, well, somebody's gonna do it, so we might as well do it, because we're the good guys, so we can control it.
[00:42:33.064 --> 00:42:48.136]  They ignore how their masters are a bunch of inbred, criminally insane demons, megalomaniacal, Malthusian social Darwinists on total power trips, criminally insane, who've had psychotic breaks,
[00:42:49.634 --> 00:42:53.117]  So you go ahead and rationalize and say, no, no, we're doing it for the best.
[00:42:53.277 --> 00:42:55.039]  I'm talking about high-level people right now.
[00:42:55.759 --> 00:43:07.609]  And then you've got the others who are just actively evil serving the globalists, who just think all of this is wonderful, and are deeply afraid of all of this, so through their fear, have decided to join it.
[00:43:07.629 --> 00:43:17.417]  So that's four groups, and then you've got the tiny elite, no more than maybe 15 families, it's probably less than that, but 15 top families,
[00:43:19.317 --> 00:43:23.378]  No more than 2,000 servants, high-level gophers, administrators.
[00:43:24.279 --> 00:43:39.483]  And then you've got a few, maybe 100,000 people that are compartmentalized and get large pieces of the puzzle, who have to be smart to be able to perform at these levels of technological integration, fourth-wave prowess.
[00:43:40.324 --> 00:43:42.904]  And so they're smart enough to see the big picture.
[00:43:43.104 --> 00:43:44.365]  And I know you're smart enough.
[00:43:44.445 --> 00:43:45.805]  What is your problem?
[00:43:46.165 --> 00:43:47.946]  What is your major malfunction?
[00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:51.171]  How am I supposed to keep calm about this?
[00:43:51.551 --> 00:44:13.538]  You nutcases are running around breeding race-specific bioweapons that'll kill whole races, just giant weapons plants everywhere, new nuclear weapons developments, running around genetic engineering, splicing goats with spiders and cockroaches with tomatoes and corn that grows live AIDS virus, publicly planting it in 96 locations.
[00:44:14.279 --> 00:44:16.339]  Just total bedlam!
[00:44:16.379 --> 00:44:17.900]  You people are out of control!
[00:44:19.648 --> 00:44:20.728]  You people are nuts!
[00:44:21.108 --> 00:44:28.710]  You say we need this global tyranny to stop all of this stuff getting turned loose, and then you're the ones running around spreading it!
[00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:35.472]  Which then gets me back to my Christian roots, and my Christian base, and my Christian compass.
[00:44:35.492 --> 00:44:37.132]  And I don't mean the phony neocon one.
[00:44:38.572 --> 00:44:41.293]  Where the Bible talks about how the devil
[00:44:42.071 --> 00:44:50.956]  The old serpent manipulates the kings of the earth and sets them up on power trips and tells them they're God and then uses them to destroy their own populations.
[00:44:51.236 --> 00:44:53.737]  And then history shows that, over and over again.
[00:44:54.077 --> 00:44:57.659]  These people get all the power, they go crazy and start slaughtering everyone!
[00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:00.440]  Because it's the nature of power.
[00:45:00.581 --> 00:45:11.006]  A good moral person is seen as weak by the globalists, as genetically weak, because we don't have that reptilian, and I'm not talking about David Icke, I use that figuratively,
[00:45:12.085 --> 00:45:34.734]  They have that reptilian coldness to just shut off the thinking process or their moral mammalian, mammal, tribal defense of the species and they're able to shift into this parasitic mode where they actually enjoy abusing people.
[00:45:35.014 --> 00:45:38.656]  Somebody who has morals feels bad when they abuse somebody.
[00:45:39.176 --> 00:45:41.057]  A sociopath just doesn't care.
[00:45:41.887 --> 00:45:46.309]  But the globalist rulers actually enjoy this.
[00:45:47.009 --> 00:45:48.930]  It's something that they like.
[00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:51.791]  And then they try to sell us on their taste.
[00:45:52.252 --> 00:45:59.475]  They try to sell us on their world view of this gladiatorial system of violence and decadence and corruption.
[00:45:59.835 --> 00:46:11.040]  They know they need to dampen our psyche, our souls, our intellects, to numb us, to dull us, to warp us, so we'll accept this so they can have their agenda!
[00:46:12.333 --> 00:46:23.441]  I mean, it's Ted Turner, it's Prince Philip, it's the UN, the Sustainability Councils, and Prince Philip and Jacques Cousteau and all these guys say they want to kill all of us.
[00:46:24.082 --> 00:46:35.050]  I mean, this is what's discussed at the high-level cocktail parties with the engineering and biology professors.
[00:46:36.391 --> 00:46:37.732]  This is their religion.
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:49.706]  And it's a religion of feeling like they're the elite and they've got this sacred grail they've got to protect and they're going to run the planet for our own good and they're a bunch of a bunch of decadent inbred psychopaths!
[00:46:52.668 --> 00:46:56.629]  We've got to have global government to stop biological weapons killing everyone.
[00:46:56.689 --> 00:46:58.490]  Meanwhile, they're building giant plants everywhere.
[00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:02.951]  Already have all these other plants built and they're handing it out like hotcakes to whoever wants it.
[00:47:03.011 --> 00:47:19.135]  And major universities put online with US and Canadian and Dutch and French and Australian agreement the recipe to create a pox out of a mouse pox that'll kill 90% of people.
[00:47:20.962 --> 00:47:23.724]  And they just put the ingredients and how to do it on the web!
[00:47:25.364 --> 00:47:41.413]  That's because their technology is so far in advance, they think they can contain all this, and they want somebody, they want somebody to brew this stuff up and release it, and out of the giant plague that's going to kill hundreds of millions, conservatively, they're going to build a total police state of total tyranny.
[00:47:43.624 --> 00:47:47.507]  So you're not trying to contain this, but by the way, you can make mistakes, too.
[00:47:47.888 --> 00:47:50.270]  You can release this stuff out of your underground airlocks.
[00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:56.555]  You can run an antimatter test that blows, you know, a continent to kingdom come, or worse.
[00:47:56.575 --> 00:47:59.317]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:47:59.337 --> 00:48:04.562]  I went off into a diatribe, but just, you know, mainstream news about antimatter.
[00:48:05.062 --> 00:48:06.924]  Oh, yeah, we got antimatter bombs.
[00:48:06.964 --> 00:48:08.866]  We're gonna start, you know, they're good.
[00:48:11.269 --> 00:48:14.110]  We don't quite know what they'll do, but we're running the test right now.
[00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:15.810]  Top scientists say, please don't do it.
[00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:18.831]  It could blow the entire Earth up, or perhaps the solar system.
[00:48:19.711 --> 00:48:20.771]  But that's okay.
[00:48:20.811 --> 00:48:22.211]  Just go ahead and mess with it.
[00:48:24.412 --> 00:48:31.773]  A hydrogen bomb is the equivalent of a pop gun, and antimatter is the equivalent of a hydrogen bomb in scale.
[00:48:33.533 --> 00:48:36.954]  So they're just throwing it together and seeing what happens.
[00:48:38.635 --> 00:48:40.575]  Oh man, these people are out of control.
[00:48:44.449 --> 00:48:45.730]  Ralph in West Virginia.
[00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:46.690]  Ralph, you're on the air.
[00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:47.211]  Go ahead.
[00:48:47.231 --> 00:48:49.612]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:48:49.692 --> 00:48:50.432]  Good, sir.
[00:48:50.813 --> 00:48:53.854]  I'm up here near the nation's capital where it's all lawless.
[00:48:54.375 --> 00:48:55.435]  I've got a question.
[00:48:55.655 --> 00:48:56.756]  You said you're in West Virginia?
[00:48:57.176 --> 00:48:58.717]  Yeah, I'm near the nation's capital.
[00:48:59.477 --> 00:49:01.879]  Not far from there.
[00:49:02.839 --> 00:49:08.262]  You mentioned on a past show where they're going to get ready to get the Holy Rollers, the Red List.
[00:49:09.243 --> 00:49:10.904]  Is there any more information on that?
[00:49:12.731 --> 00:49:14.673]  Well, I've never really said that, actually.
[00:49:15.754 --> 00:49:20.678]  That's mainly something just to scare people that's been put out for decades.
[00:49:20.798 --> 00:49:30.027]  They do have giant COINTELPRO lists, and we've interviewed FBI agents who quit the program and gone public, high-level agents like Tyrone Powers and others.
[00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:33.110]  And they have these giant lists of people you wouldn't think.
[00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:37.751]  Liberal preachers, conservative preachers, anybody who could be a leader.
[00:49:38.891 --> 00:49:40.392]  I mean, it's a giant list.
[00:49:40.472 --> 00:49:44.573]  Corporate owners, different corporations they want to grab.
[00:49:45.213 --> 00:49:47.314]  It's a giant, huge cross-section.
[00:49:48.127 --> 00:49:53.932]  No, actually, they're going to have a lot of the so-called holy rollers worshipping the new world leader thinking that Jesus has returned.
[00:49:54.172 --> 00:49:56.054]  They're now telling him, Jesus is about to return.
[00:49:56.074 --> 00:49:57.095]  He'll be your world leader.
[00:49:57.475 --> 00:50:00.057]  He's going to rule with a rod of iron and crush the unbelievers.
[00:50:00.618 --> 00:50:03.900]  And, of course, that won't really be Jesus, but don't tell them that.
[00:50:04.341 --> 00:50:04.641]  Yeah.
[00:50:05.902 --> 00:50:08.344]  Oh, no, they'll be leading the holy jihad.
[00:50:11.889 --> 00:50:19.818]  You mentioned also that there's a plan not to rig up the election where there won't be an election.
[00:50:20.859 --> 00:50:22.801]  Well, the White House has said that.
[00:50:23.842 --> 00:50:24.343]  They told U.S.
[00:50:24.823 --> 00:50:30.750]  News and World Report that there would be giant terror attacks before the election in the month of October.
[00:50:32.149 --> 00:50:40.596]  And they said that they may have to suspend or cancel the elections, and that's been in probably over a thousand publications.
[00:50:40.616 --> 00:50:43.699]  It's been top news for about four months.
[00:50:43.759 --> 00:50:44.319]  Anything else?
[00:50:44.339 --> 00:50:50.865]  So then when do you think they would get ready to get the real Christians to start rounding them up?
[00:50:50.885 --> 00:50:51.685]  Well, let's be clear.
[00:50:52.986 --> 00:50:55.368]  I'm not saying there's going to be a terror attack, but government does.
[00:50:56.329 --> 00:50:57.190]  Stay there, Ronald.
[00:50:57.250 --> 00:51:00.753]  We'll talk about more of this on the other side.
[00:51:02.415 --> 00:51:05.337]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:51:06.018 --> 00:51:07.299]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:51:07.499 --> 00:51:13.263]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:51:13.523 --> 00:51:18.787]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:51:19.067 --> 00:51:20.688]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order
[00:51:20.828 --> 00:51:22.350]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:51:58.512 --> 00:52:00.594]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:52:01.337 --> 00:52:07.601]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:52:07.721 --> 00:52:13.884]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:52:14.165 --> 00:52:22.610]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:52:22.850 --> 00:52:29.874]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:52:30.174 --> 00:52:34.997]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:52:35.217 --> 00:52:40.621]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:52:40.961 --> 00:52:44.043]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:52:44.364 --> 00:52:52.349]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:53:02.116 --> 00:53:02.637]  I think so.
[00:53:17.691 --> 00:53:18.352]  We're good to go.

[00:53:50.473 --> 00:53:56.336]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives in education.
[00:54:10.697 --> 00:54:16.461]  You see, folks, it is 2004.
[00:54:20.584 --> 00:54:32.132]  And the elite have basically frozen our technological development at one level while they have built an advanced civilization right under our noses, under the guise of national security.
[00:54:33.913 --> 00:54:37.175]  And our caller, and then we'll go to Joel and Roger and Jenna and others,
[00:54:39.807 --> 00:54:41.927]  Ralph was saying, when are they going to come get the Christians?
[00:54:41.967 --> 00:54:43.568]  Well, they're already coming and getting the Christians.
[00:54:43.588 --> 00:54:44.488]  They're getting everybody.
[00:54:45.088 --> 00:54:51.269]  We've gone from 1.3 million in prison nine years ago to 7 million in prison, and they say 30 million by the end of this decade.
[00:54:51.609 --> 00:54:53.030]  That's official government documents.
[00:54:53.410 --> 00:55:02.092]  In my film, Road to Tyranny, I show a CBS News clip where they say 33 million by 2024, but then they revised that last year and said, no, it'll be 30 million by the end of this decade.
[00:55:03.132 --> 00:55:03.892]  It's the new business.
[00:55:03.932 --> 00:55:04.552]  It's the new freedom.
[00:55:04.992 --> 00:55:08.373]  It's now caging the feral humans, as we're called, basically.
[00:55:09.844 --> 00:55:10.584]  I'm not kidding.
[00:55:10.644 --> 00:55:13.825]  They actually call us animals and feral and they're on all these power trips.
[00:55:15.505 --> 00:55:19.206]  And they've got to get us out of the way so they can have their new utopian society.
[00:55:19.806 --> 00:55:27.688]  And we see the elite telling us what they're doing in our face through James Bond movies like Moonraker or the new movie Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.
[00:55:29.129 --> 00:55:31.369]  Well, you just go read their actual documents.
[00:55:31.409 --> 00:55:33.830]  This is the type of stuff that they're planning.
[00:55:33.850 --> 00:55:35.050]  They're a bunch of nutcases.
[00:55:36.341 --> 00:55:44.326]  It's like, you know, that new James Bond movie came out and it's all about them grabbing people and stealing their DNA for life extension for the elite.
[00:55:44.946 --> 00:55:47.248]  What do you think the elite goes and gets out in Hollywood?
[00:55:47.588 --> 00:55:58.614]  Blood transfusions, new skin, you know, growth hormone, a bunch of new advanced drugs, and suddenly, you know, they look horrible, suddenly they look all young and look like they're 30 again.
[00:55:59.415 --> 00:56:01.716]  This stuff's already there, folks.
[00:56:02.897 --> 00:56:03.257]  Okay?
[00:56:03.277 --> 00:56:04.758]  You're just not going to have access to it.
[00:56:05.526 --> 00:56:08.528]  There's been a lot of leaks on this and we can now confirm it.
[00:56:09.529 --> 00:56:11.170]  But how are they going to get the Christians?
[00:56:11.191 --> 00:56:12.612]  They'll just co-opt most of them.
[00:56:13.152 --> 00:56:15.174]  They think microchips and world government are good.
[00:56:15.194 --> 00:56:20.738]  And the others, like the homeschoolers, feds are training police nationwide that homeschoolers are evil terrorists.
[00:56:20.778 --> 00:56:21.779]  And that was in the news again.
[00:56:22.179 --> 00:56:23.400]  Mainstream news last week.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:26.102]  Drills where homeschoolers attack and kill everybody.
[00:56:26.362 --> 00:56:27.944]  So we've got to, you know, these are evil people.
[00:56:28.584 --> 00:56:29.425]  Anything else, Ralph?
[00:56:30.290 --> 00:56:35.074]  Yeah, you mentioned all about all this microwave and electromagnetics and so forth.
[00:56:35.134 --> 00:56:41.219]  Well, of course, years ago there was a man named Tesla brought up a theory.
[00:56:41.319 --> 00:56:43.461]  So they got all these ideas from that.
[00:56:43.481 --> 00:56:44.482]  Well, he didn't bring up the theory.
[00:56:44.522 --> 00:56:46.223]  He developed it out in Colorado.
[00:56:46.523 --> 00:56:46.884]  Yeah.
[00:56:46.944 --> 00:56:49.346]  He was a Serb, or from that area.
[00:56:49.546 --> 00:56:50.367]  He's a communist.
[00:56:50.947 --> 00:56:52.969]  Yeah, well... Antichrist communist.
[00:56:53.009 --> 00:56:54.450]  Well, he actually worked for J.P.
[00:56:54.490 --> 00:56:54.870]  Morgan.
[00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:59.354]  Also, the Devil's Church with the Christian Coalition coming together
[00:57:00.034 --> 00:57:05.616]  And they're the ones that supplant our government to get the real Christian people.
[00:57:06.016 --> 00:57:06.616]  No, I hear you.
[00:57:06.636 --> 00:57:07.277]  Thanks for the call.
[00:57:07.657 --> 00:57:09.477]  But no, I mean, I wouldn't call Tesla a communist.
[00:57:09.497 --> 00:57:10.278]  He worked for J.P.
[00:57:10.298 --> 00:57:10.638]  Morgan.
[00:57:11.058 --> 00:57:16.019]  Then after he died, this is admitted, the FBI raided his Colorado laboratory and took everything.
[00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:20.161]  That guy was an absolute genius, made Einstein look like a...
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:22.721]  Look like a schoolboy.
[00:57:23.341 --> 00:57:37.688]  Before I end this hour, my friends, I hope everybody will visit PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day, to see all my videos, a bunch of other great films, my weekly TV reports, the best audio interviews I do on the radio show.
[00:57:38.588 --> 00:57:42.770]  My book, Paul Watson's book, 15 Cents a Day, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:45.231]  Also, I've made 11 films.
[00:57:45.271 --> 00:57:47.372]  The 11th film is now out.
[00:57:47.552 --> 00:57:52.114]  It's American Dictators, documenting the staged election of 2004.
[00:57:52.694 --> 00:58:00.838]  We go into Bush and Kerry being cousins, skull and bones, what the new world order is, what their plans are, the latest 9-11 information, American Dictators.
[00:58:01.338 --> 00:58:03.599]  And it's $19.95, 90 minutes long.

[00:58:17.265 --> 00:58:18.685]  Resistance is not futile.
[00:58:18.725 --> 00:58:30.190]  If we just wake up to the real paradigm and say no to this technocracy run by these kleptomaniacs, we can stop the New World Order.
[00:58:31.497 --> 00:58:31.837]  Alright?
[00:58:32.337 --> 00:58:35.439]  So please get the videos and get them out to people.
[00:58:35.459 --> 00:58:37.700]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:42.682]  When you call, ask about all the different specials we're offering.
[00:58:42.702 --> 00:58:45.363]  A lot of other books and videos by other authors as well.
[00:58:45.383 --> 00:58:45.423]  888-253-3139.
[00:58:45.443 --> 00:58:46.783]  Second hour straight ahead.
[00:58:46.863 --> 00:58:47.444]  Big Brother.
[00:58:47.484 --> 00:58:48.124]  Mainstream Media.
[00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:02.000]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.661 --> 00:59:03.501]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.241 --> 00:59:05.122]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.142 --> 00:59:09.463]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.003 --> 00:59:14.125]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.726 --> 00:59:23.528]  Alright, trying to defend humanity against the predatory New World Order criminals who are breeding us to be their slaves.
[00:59:24.494 --> 00:59:28.758]  The final stages of the architecture of worldwide tyranny are now upon us.
[00:59:28.818 --> 00:59:31.040]  It is the Pentagon's new map of enslavement.
[00:59:32.701 --> 00:59:46.333]  We will be the greatest slaves the world has ever known here within the empire, not just the hapless third world populations that are going to be blasted into bits and forcibly inoculated with deadly pathogens.
[00:59:47.458 --> 00:59:51.141]  We're going to do a ton of international and national news in this second hour.
[00:59:51.181 --> 00:59:53.703]  We've got a guest coming up about the Global Toll Road Plan.
[00:59:53.723 --> 00:59:56.125]  I'll give you the local view of this in Austin, Texas.
[00:59:56.205 --> 01:00:01.069]  It's very draconian, with Sal Castillo coming up in a few minutes.
[01:00:01.089 --> 01:00:02.670]  But right now, let's go back to the calls.
[01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:04.992]  Joel, in Illinois, you're on the air.
[01:00:05.032 --> 01:00:05.393]  Welcome.
[01:00:05.793 --> 01:00:06.053]  Hi.
[01:00:06.453 --> 01:00:06.774]  Hello.
[01:00:06.954 --> 01:00:09.055]  It's been a long time since I've spoken to you.
[01:00:09.516 --> 01:00:16.962]  I'm the one who sent you the article from the New American about Bush speaking in London saying that the war in Iraq was too soon to plan.
[01:00:17.921 --> 01:00:18.241]  Yes.
[01:00:18.962 --> 01:00:40.235]  But the reason I called, I had spoken to a worker at the Peruco campaign in Maryland, and I mentioned their website about the Bohemian Grove video and what have you, and suggested to them that maybe they might want to mention that in their campaign.
[01:00:40.476 --> 01:00:42.317]  I don't know if they will or not.
[01:00:43.502 --> 01:00:45.362]  Well, they should talk about Skull and Bones.
[01:00:45.402 --> 01:00:47.923]  That's an occult organization everybody knows about now.
[01:00:48.363 --> 01:00:48.583]  Yeah.
[01:00:49.683 --> 01:01:01.566]  And, uh, the, uh... I wanted to get your opinion on whether you think that Bush's military record was leaked inaccurately on purpose, but discrediting anybody who would mention it later on.
[01:01:02.046 --> 01:01:05.487]  We can't document that, but that... it stinks heavily of that.
[01:01:05.767 --> 01:01:06.047]  Yeah.
[01:01:06.887 --> 01:01:07.687]  Okay, and I got it.
[01:01:07.887 --> 01:01:12.368]  And, uh, I've just been calling him being a nuisance to these, uh, bohemian people.
[01:01:14.118 --> 01:01:21.080]  I've got the Bohemian Club number and a number for the actual Grove itself if you want those.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.181]  So you've been calling them?
[01:01:23.321 --> 01:01:24.821]  Oh yeah.
[01:01:25.381 --> 01:01:26.522]  What do you say when you call?
[01:01:26.902 --> 01:01:40.966]  I call and I called and I asked about how do you find out more information about the Grove and who's a member and of course they say in order to find out who's a member you have to become a member and the membership fees are something like $10,000 a year.
[01:01:44.564 --> 01:01:45.805]  I'm a blue collar guy.
[01:01:46.085 --> 01:01:46.605]  No, they are $10,000.
[01:01:46.686 --> 01:01:46.966]  Yeah.
[01:01:47.066 --> 01:01:58.132]  So, and the other thing I wanted to mention hypothetically, of course, is that, you know, they're not the only people who can make these things, weapons.
[01:01:59.813 --> 01:02:05.497]  The details of microwave cannon are not that involved.
[01:02:05.957 --> 01:02:11.180]  All you need is a magnetron from a microwave oven and a bank of capacitors.
[01:02:13.211 --> 01:02:18.334]  Discharge the capacitors through the magnetron, microwave oven, and there you go.
[01:02:19.194 --> 01:02:20.895]  Alright, well thank you for the call, sir.
[01:02:21.375 --> 01:02:24.897]  Let me just bring up why I guess he mentioned that.
[01:02:25.598 --> 01:02:32.521]  They're going to melt on these blimps, not just ground penetrating radar to look through your walls, now one over D.C., they're going to be over every U.S.
[01:02:32.561 --> 01:02:36.524]  city, but also microwave guns just to make sure you behave yourselves.
[01:02:37.728 --> 01:02:43.310]  Again, they've got some wonderful things planned for our cities and they need microwave guns to control crowds from the air.
[01:02:43.790 --> 01:02:56.893]  You know, we're bad and this is freedom and the terrorists attack us because they hate our freedom and so they've got to get rid of all our freedom and in case you don't like being forcibly inoculated or going to the relocation center for your safety, we've got to mount these above all your cities.
[01:02:58.534 --> 01:03:00.154]  Why, it's the world of tomorrow.
[01:03:00.294 --> 01:03:05.676]  It's the world of the new freedom where we're all psychologically forcibly tested and forcibly drugged and
[01:03:06.474 --> 01:03:12.074]  Where the new economy is presence and surveillance owned by our global leaders and they're going to take good care of us.
[01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:26.071]  All right, when we get back, we're going to be talking to Sal Costello, and he's done an incredible job of the Austin Toll Party, exposing how we're going to have 6,000 miles of toll roads in Texas compared to 7,000 nationwide.
[01:03:26.672 --> 01:03:37.540]  Our so-called conservative governor, Rick Perry, wants to have Austin have more toll roads than any other city in the country, and this is coming to a town near you, unfortunately, so this is very, very important.
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:38.341]  This is all part of the
[01:03:38.988 --> 01:03:40.630]  Tracking and Taxation Grid.
[01:03:41.131 --> 01:03:41.852]  So stay with us.
[01:03:41.932 --> 01:03:43.234]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:43.855 --> 01:03:47.120]  And we'll also, of course, take more of your calls for those that are holding.
[01:03:48.021 --> 01:03:51.506]  As well, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv are the websites.
[01:03:55.999 --> 01:04:01.480]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:06.121]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:04:06.361 --> 01:04:13.403]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:04:13.783 --> 01:04:19.885]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:04:20.025 --> 01:04:21.225]  There are no side effects.
[01:04:21.325 --> 01:04:22.046]  Uh, Sal, can you hear?
[01:04:38.363 --> 01:04:43.028]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time that's 866-885-6625 call today!
[01:04:54.156 --> 01:04:57.160]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:06.350]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:11.336]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:05:11.796 --> 01:05:18.499]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:05:18.899 --> 01:05:30.705]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:31.165 --> 01:05:35.627]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:05:43.531 --> 01:05:44.511]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:53.018 --> 01:05:57.384]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:57.564 --> 01:06:01.970]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:02.111 --> 01:06:06.497]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:06:06.537 --> 01:06:07.878]  The New World Order.
[01:06:08.679 --> 01:06:09.620]  Panama!
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:13.903]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:13.943 --> 01:06:20.907]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:21.008 --> 01:06:23.109]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:23.409 --> 01:06:33.776]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:34.036 --> 01:06:36.158]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[01:06:36.578 --> 01:06:39.360]  My new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you!

[01:06:49.468 --> 01:06:52.030]  Order today and spread the word!
[01:06:57.894 --> 01:06:58.555]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.215 --> 01:07:00.276]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.977 --> 01:07:02.117]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.738 --> 01:07:03.599]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.319 --> 01:07:05.100]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.871 --> 01:07:09.774]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.035 --> 01:07:14.158]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:26.008]  Alright, more on the new National ID Card Super Patriot Act bill, what's happening in Iraq, the Shaney Edwards debate tonight.
[01:07:26.148 --> 01:07:29.331]  Even the mainstream news is billing it as Darth Vader versus Robin.
[01:07:29.351 --> 01:07:31.233]  I mean, how ridiculous.
[01:07:32.364 --> 01:07:34.886]  So we'll talk about that as well, and I promise to get to your calls.
[01:07:35.947 --> 01:07:38.329]  Sal Castillo is an amazing individual.
[01:07:38.369 --> 01:07:39.269]  He's done his homework.
[01:07:39.850 --> 01:07:42.152]  AustinTollParty.com is the website.
[01:07:42.952 --> 01:07:45.935]  He has owned his own advertising and marketing company for 13 years.
[01:07:47.116 --> 01:07:48.076]  Castillo & Company.
[01:07:48.136 --> 01:07:49.738]  And he has lived in Austin for five years.
[01:07:49.778 --> 01:07:52.180]  Before that he lived in Florida, North Carolina, New York.
[01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:54.541]  He knows about transportation from different areas.
[01:07:55.682 --> 01:08:00.326]  And talking to him during the break, he agrees with my summation of what these toll roads are all about.
[01:08:01.342 --> 01:08:07.566]  But he says he doesn't get a lot into that because the average person, even though it's in the news, doesn't read the newspaper and finds it hard to believe.
[01:08:07.646 --> 01:08:25.397]  But, in 1998, the National Traffic Safety Law was passed, and it's to set up toll roads nationwide that will be manned by checkpoints, with quote, forced volunteers from the high schools to graduate, part of AmeriCorps and SecurCorps, and of course Homeland Security came along.
[01:08:25.617 --> 01:08:28.379]  This is all in my film, Police State 2000, that I released in 1999.
[01:08:31.065 --> 01:08:35.489]  And we go over the plan and the K-Tag and how the transponders in your car will track and trace you.
[01:08:35.909 --> 01:08:44.317]  Now, where you go through the electronic toll roads, we get into then how it's used to tax and trace and control.
[01:08:44.377 --> 01:08:51.043]  Then I have articles from two years ago where in San Francisco they use the K-Tag transponder in the car that you have to take.
[01:08:52.533 --> 01:09:00.598]  And how that transponder, they put up radio readers around the city with your ID number on it to go ahead and track what you're doing on top of just going to the toll roads.
[01:09:00.978 --> 01:09:14.567]  Then about a month ago, the Chicago Tribune had an article where the mayor there in Chicago, and now they're talking about statewide, is saying it will be double if you don't have the transponder.
[01:09:15.194 --> 01:09:16.035]  So this is what they do.
[01:09:16.075 --> 01:09:22.238]  They say, well, it's $2 if you don't have the transponder, and 50 cents, or a dollar, if you do have the transponder.
[01:09:22.839 --> 01:09:27.722]  And when I was in New York a few weeks ago, for the Republican National Convention, we would take cabs.
[01:09:28.302 --> 01:09:30.503]  And when you went through a toll road, it would be $7.
[01:09:30.543 --> 01:09:33.085]  That was the highest of tolls.
[01:09:33.105 --> 01:09:33.405]  Others were $5, $4.
[01:09:33.465 --> 01:09:35.446]  The smallest toll we saw was $2.
[01:09:41.067 --> 01:09:46.750]  And one cabbie had a transponder on his dash, but he had to pull through the lane that had all the traffic.
[01:09:46.770 --> 01:09:49.772]  Everybody else was speeding through, and he had to pay even more.
[01:09:49.792 --> 01:09:57.516]  And he goes, oh, it's about 40% more when you don't have the transponder, but I have to go fill it up with a couple thousand dollars more.
[01:09:58.056 --> 01:09:59.717]  That's what I spend just in a few weeks.
[01:10:00.484 --> 01:10:02.165]  And of course, they pass that on to you.
[01:10:02.185 --> 01:10:07.567]  Now, that's a cabbie, granted, who's going through those tolls because they do so much driving.
[01:10:07.908 --> 01:10:09.368]  But they've done an estimation.
[01:10:09.388 --> 01:10:13.150]  It's been in the local paper, $2,000 a year for the average Austinite.
[01:10:13.190 --> 01:10:17.172]  I was talking to Sal during the first break there when we got him on.
[01:10:17.192 --> 01:10:22.334]  He said, well, our numbers are $1,800 a year.
[01:10:22.354 --> 01:10:23.215]  $1,800 a year in Austin.
[01:10:23.495 --> 01:10:27.457]  And that's with a conservative toll plan they've already passed, this unelected board.
[01:10:28.595 --> 01:10:30.216]  So this is going to be everywhere.
[01:10:30.236 --> 01:10:32.857]  You're going to have federal, state, county, and city tolls.
[01:10:34.298 --> 01:10:40.801]  And the feds are talking about going to a national system, making you take a satellite tracker box in your car that you pay for when you get your tags.
[01:10:41.382 --> 01:10:48.285]  All the new cars for the last eight years, by the way, have the plug-ins and a computerized ignition made for the satellite tracker.
[01:10:48.305 --> 01:10:50.686]  So it's already been built in to the whole infrastructure.
[01:10:50.947 --> 01:10:53.488]  The official federal plan that I broke six years ago
[01:10:54.228 --> 01:11:05.281]  With a member of the Legislature of Wisconsin who was on the federal board over this who was warning people that there was a plan by 2005 to start national tolling around the country.
[01:11:05.321 --> 01:11:06.982]  Now Oregon has announced they want to do it.
[01:11:07.763 --> 01:11:09.185]  New York has announced they want to do it.
[01:11:09.245 --> 01:11:11.107]  So it's actually happening folks.
[01:11:11.427 --> 01:11:12.769]  Your car will be a taxi.
[01:11:13.549 --> 01:11:20.655]  London has passed it now, where they have cameras that scan your license plate and send you bills that you've got to pay.
[01:11:21.035 --> 01:11:29.862]  They say people are cheating on those, and so they're going to make you take a transponder to be radio-read off of this, or a satellite tracker box.
[01:11:30.122 --> 01:11:32.204]  So we're just a few years away from this.
[01:11:32.244 --> 01:11:33.785]  They had it slated for 2005.
[01:11:34.166 --> 01:11:36.988]  I'd say they're a year or two behind, but it's happening.
[01:11:38.397 --> 01:11:39.057]  It's happening.
[01:11:39.137 --> 01:11:43.118]  Now that's the big, dark, scary plan of the infrastructure.
[01:11:43.398 --> 01:11:46.878]  To give you the actual nuts and bolts of a model city.
[01:11:47.139 --> 01:11:53.280]  What your city is going to be like, if we don't stop this in places like Austin, is Sal Costello.
[01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:56.280]  Sal, I am honored to have you on with us.
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:59.301]  Thank you, I'm happy to be on.
[01:11:59.861 --> 01:12:07.002]  You mentioned the timing of this, and the first one of these toll roads for this toll plan that was passed,
[01:12:07.569 --> 01:12:30.932]  is going to be placed just a couple miles from my home on a bridge that's a it's a mile and a half long toll and that we've already paid for the bridge about ten million dollars we paid for it they're going to put a toll booth on there in March of 2005 now they're going to put a toll 400 yards from me from my home right there where Mopac hits William Cannon
[01:12:32.868 --> 01:12:33.629]  That's the bridge.
[01:12:34.010 --> 01:12:35.071]  Yeah, so you live near me.
[01:12:35.331 --> 01:12:35.511]  Yes.
[01:12:36.072 --> 01:12:43.380]  And to go basically anywhere, according to their public map, now they're announcing they're going to put even more in, to go more than a mile anywhere, I'll go through a toll.
[01:12:43.641 --> 01:12:45.463]  Oh yeah, they've got them all over town.
[01:12:46.269 --> 01:12:48.270]  And, uh, it's disturbing.
[01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:51.251]  What's really... I want to give people proof.
[01:12:51.331 --> 01:12:52.671]  This is the solid proof.
[01:12:52.691 --> 01:12:56.713]  Yeah, let's go over the whole background of this, who the players are, these unelected boards.
[01:12:56.993 --> 01:13:05.355]  I mean, you know, my audience is very intelligent, very advanced, but for those who just joined us, let's give them a whole nuts and bolts presentation.
[01:13:05.435 --> 01:13:13.178]  Well, the head-scratcher in this whole thing, if you want to boil it right down, is these boards that some of them are elected folks.
[01:13:13.278 --> 01:13:15.759]  They're like state representatives, they're county commissioners,
[01:13:16.698 --> 01:13:22.506]  And our MPO, it's called an MPO, there's 23 of them.
[01:13:23.027 --> 01:13:24.650]  And they asked us for our feedback.
[01:13:24.710 --> 01:13:25.992]  They extended the deadline.
[01:13:26.542 --> 01:13:27.943]  And then they put a deadline on the feedback.
[01:13:27.963 --> 01:13:29.104]  They want to know, do you want these?
[01:13:29.144 --> 01:13:29.844]  Do you not want these?
[01:13:30.024 --> 01:13:35.968]  But, but, but, they're on, but sir, they're on though, let's make this clear, unelected regional boards.
[01:13:36.388 --> 01:13:41.751]  No, this board is elected, but then... No, I know, but I'm talking about the larger statewide board, but go ahead.
[01:13:41.991 --> 01:13:50.436]  Okay, but then the RMA, the Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority, they're the ones that are going to run the toll roads.
[01:13:50.657 --> 01:13:51.657]  They are not elected.
[01:13:52.558 --> 01:13:54.459]  The one person is appointed by the governor.
[01:13:55.499 --> 01:13:57.380]  And then they pull in other people.
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:58.540]  I don't know what's going on there.
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:03.122]  But the thing that bugs me is they asked us for our feedback.
[01:14:03.142 --> 01:14:04.142]  They gave us a deadline.
[01:14:04.502 --> 01:14:06.263]  Ninety-three percent of the people said no.
[01:14:07.323 --> 01:14:08.343]  Ninety-three percent.
[01:14:08.903 --> 01:14:09.984]  And that was here in Austin.
[01:14:10.004 --> 01:14:12.825]  And in Houston, ninety-eight percent said no.
[01:14:13.405 --> 01:14:17.486]  And these local officials voted for it anyway.
[01:14:18.246 --> 01:14:21.007]  Now these folks are supposed to represent us.
[01:14:22.068 --> 01:14:23.088]  And they've ignored us.
[01:14:23.914 --> 01:14:34.542]  And that's one of the reasons why we did AustinTollParty.com and when people go to step one and they hit one button, they send a message to over 200 state officials to tell them no.
[01:14:35.123 --> 01:14:40.987]  To tell them that we're watching them, we're going to bump them out of office, they need to stop these plans.
[01:14:42.012 --> 01:14:48.056]  Now, just a few years ago, if 93% of people or 98% of people were against something, they wouldn't pass it.
[01:14:48.496 --> 01:14:58.282]  But now we have those magical no-record voting machines, owned by Clear Channel here in Austin, Hardener Civics, so magically now they're very, very arrogant, but that's a whole other subject.
[01:14:58.722 --> 01:15:08.708]  For people that just joined us, the maps on your website, their official map, go over how this plan developed and how many toll roads we're going to have and how this is different from other toll systems.
[01:15:09.188 --> 01:15:13.590]  Well, if you go to AustinTollPay.com, you'll see the map as soon as you go there.
[01:15:14.090 --> 01:15:15.691]  But it's all over the city.
[01:15:15.791 --> 01:15:24.835]  And the disturbing thing about this is no other city in the country has shifted its daily highways all over the city to tollways.
[01:15:25.335 --> 01:15:27.376]  And in Austin, that's exactly what they're doing.
[01:15:27.676 --> 01:15:32.098]  They're shifting all our daily highways except for the one Interstate 35.
[01:15:33.039 --> 01:15:33.479]  Everything.
[01:15:33.619 --> 01:15:34.439]  We're talking about 183, 71, Mopac,
[01:15:38.625 --> 01:15:39.945]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[01:15:39.985 --> 01:15:40.486]  It's everything.
[01:15:41.186 --> 01:15:42.286]  And it's disturbing.
[01:15:42.466 --> 01:15:48.567]  And there's multiple toll roads at every entrance point by other highways coming into the region.
[01:15:48.968 --> 01:15:49.148]  Yes.
[01:15:51.028 --> 01:15:51.228]  Yeah.
[01:15:52.829 --> 01:16:07.172]  And some of the more disturbing parts of the plan is that they are converting roads that we paid for, some of them being built right now, over a hundred million dollars worth, they're going to just put
[01:16:07.927 --> 01:16:08.748]  Toll booths on them.
[01:16:09.688 --> 01:16:11.049]  Things we've already paid for.
[01:16:11.569 --> 01:16:16.973]  That is so disturbing and frustrating that, you know, I've never been an activist before.
[01:16:18.173 --> 01:16:19.574]  This thing started happening.
[01:16:20.295 --> 01:16:25.338]  I wanted to learn about just that bridge that I'll call my bridge and your bridge.
[01:16:25.918 --> 01:16:29.360]  And when I called techs.finance, I spent a week and a half on the phone with them.
[01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:30.981]  I want to know about that bridge.
[01:16:31.461 --> 01:16:32.322]  They kept telling me.
[01:16:32.982 --> 01:16:34.403]  They had to tell me about the whole plan.
[01:16:34.443 --> 01:16:35.844]  They couldn't just tell me about the bridge.
[01:16:36.397 --> 01:16:39.940]  So I had to learn about the whole plan when I didn't want to, and I realized what was happening.
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:49.506]  And I wanted to use my skills as a marketing and design professional to communicate with the rest of Austin, if I possibly could, to tell them what was happening.
[01:16:49.987 --> 01:16:54.710]  Now, to describe this properly for folks, you've got to really see the map to understand the full magnitude.
[01:16:55.130 --> 01:17:04.797]  In the past, they'd say we're building a loop around the city, and for ten years, to pay for it, it's going to have toll roads, and then when it was paid for, they took the toll booths out of it.
[01:17:05.490 --> 01:17:28.367]  Okay, now they're taking all the existing major roads and side roads and everything and they are converting them to toll roads and then we first hear it's going to be 7 toll roads, then 9 toll roads, then 15 toll roads and then the plans get bigger and bigger and oh it's going to be all of Central Texas and oh it's going to link up with San Antonio and Dallas and I mean how big is this thing really going to get?
[01:17:28.867 --> 01:17:31.489]  Well, they've got the city plan
[01:17:32.196 --> 01:17:35.378]  that are happening now in the cities and even small towns have called me.
[01:17:35.898 --> 01:17:40.521]  Like Bastrop, I believe it is, where they've got one main highway with a place in the toll on that.
[01:17:41.021 --> 01:17:55.710]  But there's also the Trans-Texas Corridor Tollways, which is Perry's 4,000 mile long connection from city to city, and that thing is a quarter mile wide in their tollways.
[01:17:55.750 --> 01:18:01.834]  But what's different about these tollways and the Austin Plan, then tollways that have been done throughout
[01:18:02.478 --> 01:18:10.041]  of the history of our country is those tollways before Austin have always been financed with 80% investor dollars.
[01:18:11.221 --> 01:18:17.003]  But what's happening here is they're only using 19% investor dollars and the rest are our tax dollars.
[01:18:17.063 --> 01:18:19.684]  But then the private investors get the lion's share of the profit.
[01:18:20.044 --> 01:18:21.665]  So it's really corporate fascism.
[01:18:21.685 --> 01:18:27.107]  So what happens is they take existing roads and just throw a gate up on it where they're going to tax you.
[01:18:27.802 --> 01:18:28.222]  That's right.
[01:18:28.322 --> 01:18:37.025]  And before, because the investors were putting money up 80%, they had to do traffic and revenue studies to see if they were feasible, if they made sense.
[01:18:37.566 --> 01:18:38.926]  But now they're not doing those things.
[01:18:38.946 --> 01:18:40.687]  They're just plopping them down wherever they want them.
[01:18:41.287 --> 01:18:43.028]  I would call this corporate looting.
[01:18:43.848 --> 01:18:52.431]  When I get back, we'll give you more details of this plan that's coming to a town near you and will engulf Texas.
[01:18:54.466 --> 01:19:03.552]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:19:03.792 --> 01:19:15.019]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:19:15.359 --> 01:19:21.083]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:19:21.323 --> 01:19:27.969]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:34.994]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:19:35.275 --> 01:19:37.056]  Supercharge your gravity filter today!
[01:19:37.316 --> 01:19:39.378]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[01:19:39.578 --> 01:19:42.481]  Get a two-pack for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175.
[01:19:42.521 --> 01:19:43.161]  Call New Millennium at 888
[01:19:52.808 --> 01:19:54.329]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:19:54.509 --> 01:19:55.649]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:19:55.810 --> 01:19:59.232]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:19:59.332 --> 01:19:59.792]  Phenol?
[01:20:00.072 --> 01:20:07.137]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:20:07.697 --> 01:20:11.600]  The FDA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:12.141]  Fragrance?
[01:20:12.521 --> 01:20:17.305]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:20:17.405 --> 01:20:22.089]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discolorations to name a few.
[01:20:22.329 --> 01:20:24.872]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Calben shampoo.
[01:20:25.152 --> 01:20:28.555]  Well, like all of the products from the Calben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:20:28.715 --> 01:20:32.218]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[01:20:32.438 --> 01:20:34.800]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[01:20:34.961 --> 01:20:35.861]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:20:35.962 --> 01:20:45.711]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with CalBend Pure Soaps.

[01:20:54.454 --> 01:20:56.236]  Jack Brownring for Midas Resources.
[01:20:56.736 --> 01:21:00.159]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:01.320]  Let's update.
[01:21:01.841 --> 01:21:06.585]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[01:21:07.206 --> 01:21:09.668]  The NASDAQ in that same time frame is flat.
[01:21:10.349 --> 01:21:11.310]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[01:21:11.330 --> 01:21:13.672]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[01:21:14.172 --> 01:21:15.093]  Today, the U.S.
[01:21:15.113 --> 01:21:17.355]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[01:21:17.735 --> 01:21:19.237]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[01:21:19.810 --> 01:21:21.791]  January of 02, gold spot was $283.
[01:21:23.151 --> 01:21:28.013]  January of 04, it's well over $400 in a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[01:21:29.013 --> 01:21:31.174]  Gold is moving, equities are treading water.
[01:21:31.574 --> 01:21:34.135]  This is a little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[01:21:34.773 --> 01:21:36.154]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[01:21:36.574 --> 01:21:38.296]  Physical possession, private gold.
[01:21:38.716 --> 01:21:40.678]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[01:21:41.078 --> 01:21:43.199]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[01:21:45.381 --> 01:21:47.523]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.
[01:21:47.903 --> 01:21:48.183]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.050 --> 01:21:56.631]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[01:21:56.871 --> 01:21:58.291]  If so, hope has arrived.
[01:21:58.771 --> 01:22:00.211]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[01:22:00.471 --> 01:22:05.652]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[01:22:06.012 --> 01:22:10.493]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[01:22:10.793 --> 01:22:19.435]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[01:22:19.955 --> 01:22:21.095]  Gum disease is serious.
[01:22:21.555 --> 01:22:25.316]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[01:22:25.596 --> 01:22:32.218]  With a regular program of oral hygiene, including vitamin toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[01:22:32.558 --> 01:22:36.599]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.
[01:22:37.019 --> 01:22:39.000]  Order yours today from Cliff Scott Enterprises.

[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:40.020]  That's 800-569-4340.
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:41.300]  Or visit their website at www.cliffscott.com.
[01:22:56.548 --> 01:22:57.049]  Don't worry.
[01:22:57.509 --> 01:22:59.050]  This show is documented.
[01:22:59.551 --> 01:23:02.833]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:03.294 --> 01:23:07.937]  Alright, your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[01:23:07.957 --> 01:23:14.683]  We're talking to Sal Castillo, who is doing just an amazing job exposing these toll road scams.
[01:23:15.103 --> 01:23:17.064]  And again, years ago I warned you of this plan.
[01:23:17.124 --> 01:23:25.167]  Every major highway, every major city road, to get into cities as part of a smart growth plan, paying tolls to get in, paying tolls to get out.
[01:23:25.527 --> 01:23:26.467]  That's what this does.
[01:23:26.587 --> 01:23:27.727]  A ring around the city.
[01:23:28.108 --> 01:23:34.210]  I was at a smart growth conference in 98 where they had maps very similar to the ones that the state has now released.
[01:23:34.650 --> 01:23:40.352]  And to clarify what I was saying earlier about unelected boards, to clarify that I was talking to Selder in the break,
[01:23:41.032 --> 01:23:45.854]  Our city has signed over its authority to this unelected board.
[01:23:46.094 --> 01:23:48.395]  Can you elaborate on that, Sal?
[01:23:48.956 --> 01:23:49.236]  Yeah.
[01:23:49.396 --> 01:23:54.778]  Throughout Texas, most of these authorities have been produced.
[01:23:55.318 --> 01:23:56.339]  They are not elected.
[01:23:56.879 --> 01:23:58.160]  They're RMAs.
[01:23:58.380 --> 01:24:01.061]  Ours is called the CTRMA.
[01:24:01.821 --> 01:24:06.483]  And the head of each RMA is appointed by Rick Perry.
[01:24:07.004 --> 01:24:10.025]  And then they sort of fill in the slots with whoever they want.
[01:24:10.995 --> 01:24:29.103]  So basically this board will sort of get these toll roads built in a very short period of time, and then we believe that with the language that was passed in House Bill 3588, that they're going to sell or lease our roads.
[01:24:30.744 --> 01:24:34.706]  Now it's legally okay for them to sell or lease our roads.
[01:24:35.327 --> 01:24:36.507]  To private corporations.
[01:24:36.787 --> 01:24:40.988]  Now, and the city signed over its control, uh, now to these people.
[01:24:41.008 --> 01:24:43.009]  And understand folks, this is the new world order.
[01:24:43.049 --> 01:24:54.251]  This is corporate fascism, where they socialize our wealth, take it from us, build the infrastructure, and then hand it over, uh, to, uh, the oligarchs, just like they have it in Russia.
[01:24:54.771 --> 01:24:55.652]  This is the system.
[01:24:55.752 --> 01:25:01.813]  And for those that just joined us and understand this, I've been through Kansas and other states, where for a hundred miles,
[01:25:02.708 --> 01:25:03.769]  You cannot exit.
[01:25:03.969 --> 01:25:06.551]  All you see is small towns that are ghost towns.
[01:25:06.891 --> 01:25:09.453]  They've got big concrete barriers and fences.
[01:25:09.793 --> 01:25:13.155]  The McDonald's and gas stations are built in the middle of the road.
[01:25:13.576 --> 01:25:15.097]  You cannot exit.
[01:25:15.657 --> 01:25:18.059]  And it literally shuts off all the communities.
[01:25:18.339 --> 01:25:20.561]  This is part also of that big U.N.
[01:25:20.961 --> 01:25:22.402]  UNESCO plan, folks.
[01:25:22.682 --> 01:25:25.564]  This is how they're going to force us off of the rural areas.
[01:25:25.904 --> 01:25:27.966]  And we were talking during the break about this, Sal.
[01:25:28.186 --> 01:25:32.089]  Can you tell folks about these trans, you know, Texas and other corridors?
[01:25:32.489 --> 01:25:50.955]  Yeah, I don't know as much about the Trans-Texas Corridors as some others, but I have learned that there's 4,000 miles in the plan, and it's from city to city, and I do know also that they will shut out and kill small towns because there's going to be no off-ramps to these small towns.
[01:25:51.535 --> 01:25:57.497]  But, you know, just this quarter-mile wide tollway that is built with our money,
[01:25:59.284 --> 01:26:04.028]  And it's kind of like a bigger version of what's happening in our cities and towns throughout Texas.
[01:26:04.828 --> 01:26:10.113]  And we do have a very few elected officials that they are fighting for us.
[01:26:10.653 --> 01:26:11.954]  One of them is Terry Keele.
[01:26:12.915 --> 01:26:27.807]  He has literally asked the Comptroller, on Friday it was in the news, him and Brewster McCracken, asked the Comptroller to do an audit of our CTRMA because they want to spend one and a half million dollars
[01:26:28.413 --> 01:26:31.395]  They've already given these contracts out for public relations.
[01:26:32.336 --> 01:26:33.857]  And that's our gas tax dollars.
[01:26:34.037 --> 01:26:35.878]  That's money that could be used for building roads.
[01:26:35.918 --> 01:26:37.860]  And so now it's going to be propaganda money.
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:42.883]  Again, 93% in Austin, 98% in Houston.
[01:26:43.003 --> 01:26:43.223]  Right.
[01:26:43.404 --> 01:26:44.344]  No one's for this.
[01:26:44.384 --> 01:26:45.825]  Not liberals, not conservatives.
[01:26:46.105 --> 01:26:53.311]  And then we have Governor Rick Perry with this corporate looting to hand our roads over to private corporations.
[01:26:53.351 --> 01:26:54.171]  That's exactly right.
[01:26:54.211 --> 01:26:58.114]  And they spent years and the special interest spent millions of dollars
[01:26:58.928 --> 01:27:00.108]  Changing our laws.
[01:27:00.588 --> 01:27:05.570]  And the 3588, by the way, was Mike Cruzzi, who is in Round Rock.
[01:27:05.610 --> 01:27:07.270]  He's a state rep there.
[01:27:07.690 --> 01:27:14.692]  He's the one that took Rick Perry's ball, this 3588 House Bill, and passed it.
[01:27:15.992 --> 01:27:20.173]  But hopefully this January, February, Keele and others will fight
[01:27:20.703 --> 01:27:23.484]  To amend or rescind this House Bill 3588?
[01:27:23.524 --> 01:27:25.945]  Well, this is what they do.
[01:27:25.965 --> 01:27:31.847]  6,000 miles statewide, 4,000 just on the state and federal highways, 2,000 in the cities.
[01:27:32.708 --> 01:27:36.229]  Austin being, you know, just an incredible data test of this.
[01:27:36.269 --> 01:27:37.490]  Folks, you've got to see the maps of this.
[01:27:37.690 --> 01:27:40.471]  Who will be able to get in or out without paying tolls or go anywhere?
[01:27:41.091 --> 01:27:42.912]  Literally, I'm going to be a prisoner in my house.
[01:27:43.472 --> 01:27:45.313]  They're saying it's going to destroy neighborhoods.
[01:27:45.973 --> 01:27:47.854]  This is a nightmare and
[01:27:49.415 --> 01:27:52.476]  I really don't have words to describe how draconian this is.
[01:27:52.676 --> 01:28:03.321]  Well, I've got to also tell you that I've gotten emails from folks that have been trying to sell their home, and they've had to reduce their home that's a $600,000 house to $500,000.
[01:28:03.581 --> 01:28:14.186]  They still can't sell it because people, when they look at it, they go, it's a beautiful house, nice and quiet, but the toll roads are coming down the street and we don't want to buy it.
[01:28:14.486 --> 01:28:16.287]  So it's hurting home value.
[01:28:17.208 --> 01:28:21.789]  And that's why I'll ask everybody who's listening to go to AustinPollParty.com and do step one.
[01:28:21.829 --> 01:28:23.169]  You don't have to live in Austin.
[01:28:23.609 --> 01:28:26.530]  This thing goes to all state representatives throughout the whole state.
[01:28:27.070 --> 01:28:31.751]  And if we can stop it here in Austin, there's a better chance we can stop it in other cities.
[01:28:32.451 --> 01:28:34.371]  Well, it's happening now around the country.
[01:28:34.391 --> 01:28:36.512]  I mean, this is the model, folks.
[01:28:36.552 --> 01:28:38.332]  This is the New World Order corporate looting.
[01:28:38.372 --> 01:28:40.333]  We'll come back, get more into this, and take your calls.
[01:28:41.013 --> 01:28:42.053]  Stay with us, PresentPlanet.tv.
[01:28:44.401 --> 01:28:47.384]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.305 --> 01:28:50.988]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.519 --> 01:28:55.219]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:28:55.300 --> 01:28:57.820]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:58.680]  It feels great.
[01:28:58.860 --> 01:28:59.881]  Absolutely wonderful.
[01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:05.522]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:29:05.842 --> 01:29:07.363]  Kimberly, tell us about your success.
[01:29:07.663 --> 01:29:10.003]  Okay, I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[01:29:10.144 --> 01:29:13.324]  I've lost 16 pounds and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[01:29:13.444 --> 01:29:14.105]  Incredible.
[01:29:14.305 --> 01:29:15.525]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[01:29:15.545 --> 01:29:19.226]  I have a 21-month-old child and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[01:29:19.326 --> 01:29:20.147]  Well that's for sure.
[01:29:20.307 --> 01:29:20.867]  Was it easy?
[01:29:21.107 --> 01:29:21.728]  Very easy.
[01:29:21.768 --> 01:29:22.648]  I mean there's nothing to it.
[01:29:22.668 --> 01:29:27.852]  You can actually still continue to eat meals with your children and not starve yourself or anything else and lose weight.
[01:29:28.072 --> 01:29:34.317]  I know you can lose fat the safe and healthy way just like Kimberly did with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:29:34.677 --> 01:29:35.518]  Call right now.
[01:29:35.538 --> 01:29:35.718]  1-800-622-FIN.
[01:29:35.738 --> 01:29:36.058]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[01:29:36.098 --> 01:29:41.941]  Remember, imagine you heard it right here, and that gets you $25 off a three-month supply.
[01:29:41.961 --> 01:29:43.022]  So call Vim and Vigor today.
[01:29:43.042 --> 01:29:43.182]  1-800-622-FIN.
[01:29:43.202 --> 01:29:43.802]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[01:29:53.127 --> 01:30:00.651]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:30:00.911 --> 01:30:11.836]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:30:12.196 --> 01:30:12.336]  I think?
[01:30:28.584 --> 01:30:29.085]  That's right!
[01:30:29.265 --> 01:30:36.371]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:30:36.671 --> 01:30:40.795]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[01:30:40.955 --> 01:30:45.419]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:45.479 --> 01:30:46.140]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:54.204 --> 01:30:55.685]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:30:55.905 --> 01:31:03.227]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:31:03.548 --> 01:31:07.969]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:18.073]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:31:18.833 --> 01:31:22.494]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[01:31:22.814 --> 01:31:25.335]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[01:31:25.615 --> 01:31:31.536]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:31:31.776 --> 01:31:33.397]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:31:33.617 --> 01:31:34.497]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:31:34.597 --> 01:31:37.578]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[01:31:37.738 --> 01:31:38.638]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[01:31:38.678 --> 01:31:38.878]  That's 800-255-1912.
[01:31:38.918 --> 01:31:42.819]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Update.
[01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:50.602]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:31:54.865 --> 01:32:00.009]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:00.690 --> 01:32:03.052]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:04.773 --> 01:32:16.623]  Whether you're listening in Pensacola, Florida, or Albuquerque, New Mexico, or Denver, Colorado, or Los Angeles, California, Rhode Island, the federal plan
[01:32:17.478 --> 01:32:26.245]  It is every inch of road in this country that is state, federal, or local, will be taxed and controlled.
[01:32:26.285 --> 01:32:27.066]  It's the official plan.
[01:32:27.086 --> 01:32:27.987]  I've known it for six years.
[01:32:28.767 --> 01:32:30.429]  I made a film about it five years ago.
[01:32:31.630 --> 01:32:41.398]  Spent about 15-20 minutes of the two hour, five minute film, Police State 2000, on this and the federal plans up on the screen showing you them.
[01:32:43.186 --> 01:32:53.810]  And I've been all over this country, folks, and the worst stuff I've seen is up in Kansas and Missouri, those toll roads, I-35 coming up out of Texas and Oklahoma.
[01:32:53.951 --> 01:32:56.392]  And folks, you can't even get off on another road.
[01:32:56.512 --> 01:33:08.116]  I mean, literally, you'll drive for an hour, and you see all these big old ghost towns and courthouses to your left and your right, and all these old shut-down gas stations and nice farmhouses shut down, boarded up.
[01:33:08.196 --> 01:33:09.297]  I mean, it's just gone.
[01:33:09.907 --> 01:33:13.190]  Because you're on this toll road and all the exit ramps have been cut off.
[01:33:13.970 --> 01:33:16.092]  They built our society around the automobile.
[01:33:16.132 --> 01:33:17.073]  We're sprawled out.
[01:33:17.093 --> 01:33:17.894]  We're spread out.
[01:33:18.474 --> 01:33:20.816]  And now they're going to jack the oil prices up to $6 a gallon.
[01:33:20.836 --> 01:33:22.777]  They said they're going to do it in the next five years.
[01:33:23.778 --> 01:33:25.700]  The oil companies making record profits.
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:27.001]  This is all by design, folks.
[01:33:28.842 --> 01:33:30.544]  They say they're going to tax in traces.
[01:33:31.104 --> 01:33:38.170]  And here in Austin, Texas, the newspaper said $2,000 a year on average for the average family driving their car.
[01:33:39.970 --> 01:33:51.358]  Our guest who's been on the vanguard cutting edge of exposing this says it's going to be 1,800 folks and then the state highways and everything else to get anywhere.
[01:33:51.378 --> 01:33:59.483]  A toll roads which also serve as surveillance and checkpoints and then track you with your transponder with your ID number on it everywhere you go and what you do.
[01:33:59.743 --> 01:34:04.166]  And they said if you run these things three times they're going to come arrest you.
[01:34:04.989 --> 01:34:06.109]  That's been in the news as well.
[01:34:06.450 --> 01:34:07.650]  So this is happening all over.
[01:34:07.690 --> 01:34:13.472]  But Texas, with our so-called conservative governor, Rick Perry, doing this to us.
[01:34:14.772 --> 01:34:19.774]  We're about to go back to Sal and then we'll go to Roger and Chris and Kim and many others.
[01:34:19.794 --> 01:34:24.196]  If you want to talk about this or other issues about transportation and taxation, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:33.811]  And all the small towns off state interstates or federal interstates, they will shut you down.
[01:34:33.851 --> 01:34:34.391]  You understand?
[01:34:34.691 --> 01:34:37.052]  You will be shut down.
[01:34:37.212 --> 01:34:37.792]  I've been there.
[01:34:38.052 --> 01:34:38.613]  I've seen it.
[01:34:40.573 --> 01:34:42.134]  You want your car to be turned into a taxi?
[01:34:42.714 --> 01:34:44.975]  The roads are already paid for five times over?
[01:34:45.735 --> 01:34:46.995]  Get ready for it, my friends.
[01:34:48.336 --> 01:34:53.998]  Now before we go back to our guest, at austintollroads.com, I have made 11 films.
[01:34:56.039 --> 01:35:02.302]  My 11th film, American Dictators, documenting the staged election of 2004 is out.
[01:35:02.702 --> 01:35:08.665]  It shows how Bush and Kerry are identical on real policies, how they're cousins, how they're members of the same secret organizations.
[01:35:09.206 --> 01:35:11.467]  We get into the whole police state they're setting up, 9-11.
[01:35:12.147 --> 01:35:14.108]  It's a great new video, 90 minutes long, 1995.
[01:35:14.288 --> 01:35:21.092]  I also have my two 9-11 films, 9-11 The Road to Tyranny and The Masters of Terror, that document what really happened on 9-11.
[01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:27.304]  And then we also carry George Humphrey, former Austin City Council member's documentary about 9-11.
[01:35:27.324 --> 01:35:29.105]  9-11, The Great Illusion.
[01:35:29.725 --> 01:35:32.928]  Eric Huffschmid's video, 9-11, The Great Deception.
[01:35:33.408 --> 01:35:35.370]  We have all those on VHS and DVD.
[01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:39.152]  Available at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:39.172 --> 01:35:46.598]  Just go to the safe, secure online shopping cart and watch video clips or read about the different films, look at the different specials we have to offer and take action.
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:54.744]  Or simply call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:55.165 --> 01:35:59.727]  In my videos, you're authorized to make copies of for non-profit educational purposes.
[01:36:00.087 --> 01:36:00.368]  Get them.
[01:36:00.428 --> 01:36:01.248]  Make 10 copies.
[01:36:01.508 --> 01:36:02.709]  Get them out to opinion makers.
[01:36:03.129 --> 01:36:05.411]  Cause this revolution of understanding.
[01:36:05.771 --> 01:36:07.372]  Take the blinders off people's eyes.
[01:36:07.412 --> 01:36:08.432]  These videos can do it.
[01:36:08.452 --> 01:36:08.512]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:36:15.114 --> 01:36:21.718]  Or just write to me, I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:36:23.599 --> 01:36:34.246]  And all of my videos, and all the other videos I mentioned, and my weekly TV reports, and my best radio interviews, this one will be there, are posted at PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day, folks.
[01:36:35.646 --> 01:36:38.068]  Okay, let's go back to our guest.
[01:36:39.433 --> 01:36:51.202]  Let's talk about how they get local officials to sign over their authority and perpetuity to these unelected state boards that then hand it all over to private corporations who've paid for their campaigns.
[01:36:51.502 --> 01:36:56.006]  Let's go over one of my favorite demons, who I've been fighting for years, Karen Sunlightner.
[01:36:57.207 --> 01:37:01.250]  She's one of the most jack-booted creatures known, one of the county commissioners.
[01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:04.993]  Let's talk about how they get things done, Sal.
[01:37:05.433 --> 01:37:07.695]  Well, I want to talk about the big picture first.
[01:37:08.537 --> 01:37:09.917]  Yeah, let's do that!
[01:37:09.957 --> 01:37:15.899]  That's Rick Williamson, who is on the Texas Transportation Commission, is friends with Perry.
[01:37:15.939 --> 01:37:17.439]  They go back for decades.
[01:37:18.259 --> 01:37:28.341]  And what he did was he said, he told each area, if you don't accept these toll plans we're giving you, then you are going to get no money from us.
[01:37:28.761 --> 01:37:29.561]  That's TxDOT.
[01:37:30.142 --> 01:37:31.202]  They're the head of TxDOT.
[01:37:31.302 --> 01:37:33.882]  So, it's toll roads or no roads.
[01:37:34.062 --> 01:37:34.883]  That's what they told him.
[01:37:35.043 --> 01:37:36.803]  Literally, that's the words he's used.
[01:37:37.498 --> 01:37:42.420]  So, they've threatened the local officials, if they don't do it, they'll get no money.
[01:37:42.741 --> 01:37:55.487]  And the local officials, then they have the local special interests here, which are, you know, the real estate folks, like the big development folks, and the lawyers that are working with these special interests.
[01:37:55.947 --> 01:37:59.909]  They basically give them money for their campaigns, like Karen Sunlightner.
[01:38:00.924 --> 01:38:09.006]  This past Wednesday she had a up to $2,500 a plate fundraiser by all the special interest folks.
[01:38:10.187 --> 01:38:16.148]  And we had a ticket there and there's a video of it as well.
[01:38:16.728 --> 01:38:18.829]  And you can find it at AustinTollParty.com.
[01:38:19.389 --> 01:38:22.550]  And then other elected officials like Donna Dukes
[01:38:23.546 --> 01:38:26.487]  has a sister and she works for the CTRMA.
[01:38:27.407 --> 01:38:28.868]  She's worked there since February.
[01:38:28.948 --> 01:38:45.113]  What the American Statesman found out was that she's worked since February, but the contract wasn't signed for her sister until Donna Dukes voted for the plan and the contract was signed the morning after the vote.
[01:38:47.474 --> 01:38:49.594]  That's the kind of nonsense that they have going on.
[01:38:49.654 --> 01:38:51.515]  And again, folks, for those who don't understand,
[01:38:53.101 --> 01:38:56.864]  $1,800 per family car.
[01:38:57.084 --> 01:38:58.065]  That's just minimum.
[01:38:58.485 --> 01:38:59.566]  That's just in Austin.
[01:39:00.207 --> 01:39:05.732]  With a tracker transponder that follows you and knows exactly where you're going and what you did.
[01:39:06.292 --> 01:39:08.274]  Not to mention all these cameras they put up.
[01:39:09.055 --> 01:39:10.236]  We paid for these roads.
[01:39:10.716 --> 01:39:17.382]  And then you find out the corporations behind all this have us pay for the roads, then put tolls on it, and the government basically gives it to them.
[01:39:17.924 --> 01:39:19.727]  This is the future of everything.
[01:39:19.747 --> 01:39:20.648]  You want to live in Russia?
[01:39:20.888 --> 01:39:22.110]  You're going to live in it right here.
[01:39:22.570 --> 01:39:26.976]  And all these small towns, folks, that are on these major roads, it's over for you.
[01:39:27.076 --> 01:39:30.861]  And by the way, again, I cannot stress that enough.
[01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:38.502]  And, you know, the problem is we're going to fight this, we're going to speak out, and, you know, they'll cut it by 20% or 30% or something.
[01:39:38.522 --> 01:39:42.324]  It'll still, we'll still have as many toll roads in Texas as they have nationwide.
[01:39:42.744 --> 01:39:45.546]  You know, they have 7,000 nationwide, this will get to 6,000 nationwide.
[01:39:45.986 --> 01:39:48.127]  But the problem is, this is going in all over the country.
[01:39:48.287 --> 01:39:53.929]  Austin, just in Texas, seems to be on the vanguard of this, but I've been seeing these plans for years, and they're going ahead with it.
[01:39:54.049 --> 01:39:55.210]  How do we stop them?
[01:39:59.290 --> 01:40:00.572]  Are you asking me?
[01:40:00.792 --> 01:40:01.053]  Yes.
[01:40:01.213 --> 01:40:03.756]  Well, AustinTollParty.com is the way we're going to stop them.
[01:40:04.577 --> 01:40:05.879]  Step one is very important.
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:11.467]  But hopefully, we've got some volunteer lawyers and we're getting ready, hopefully, to hire
[01:40:12.825 --> 01:40:22.775]  With some sort of a deal from a firm that will put forward a lawsuit that can stop them not only here in Austin, but hopefully stop them in other cities.
[01:40:22.915 --> 01:40:30.302]  Now you know when you're dealing with tens of billions of dollars a year in the aggregate, and they admit that, you're going to have serious stuff you're facing.
[01:40:30.602 --> 01:40:34.066]  You better watch the law firm because there's a lot of problems with infiltration.
[01:40:34.366 --> 01:40:35.627]  Yeah, well I know that.
[01:40:37.009 --> 01:40:37.949]  Oh, that's a good question.
[01:40:37.969 --> 01:40:41.530]  Have you had any of their minions try to infiltrate your organization?
[01:40:42.831 --> 01:40:43.671]  I know of one.
[01:40:45.352 --> 01:40:50.713]  I know of one that sort of got in, but there might be others.
[01:40:50.773 --> 01:40:51.173]  I don't know.
[01:40:51.253 --> 01:40:52.074]  We just don't know.
[01:40:52.794 --> 01:40:53.394]  And what do they do?
[01:40:53.434 --> 01:40:54.514]  Try to sow dissension?
[01:40:54.534 --> 01:40:55.655]  Get people in fights?
[01:40:55.935 --> 01:41:02.497]  No, actually this one came in and he was real helpful and he says, hey, I know about technology and stuff and I can help you with your data.
[01:41:03.037 --> 01:41:06.418]  And he got in there and started getting into our data.
[01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:11.382]  And then we, uh, he actually took some of it and we couldn't get it back.
[01:41:12.302 --> 01:41:13.503]  So we just had that issue.
[01:41:14.403 --> 01:41:14.603]  So.
[01:41:16.424 --> 01:41:18.845]  Oh yeah, you're dealing with a military operation here.
[01:41:18.905 --> 01:41:19.866]  I just hope you know that.
[01:41:20.226 --> 01:41:21.006]  Yeah.
[01:41:21.306 --> 01:41:25.688]  This isn't, and by military, I mean, this is run like a military operation will be run.
[01:41:26.308 --> 01:41:31.151]  I just want people nationwide to know, I mean, you want your car to be a taxi, you better go along with this.
[01:41:34.192 --> 01:41:35.032]  It's like we're sheep.
[01:41:35.352 --> 01:41:35.733]  It's funny.
[01:41:37.774 --> 01:41:40.757]  Absurd part of this is that they asked us for our feedback.
[01:41:41.458 --> 01:41:42.639]  They gave us a deadline.
[01:41:42.659 --> 01:41:44.401]  93% of us said no.
[01:41:44.742 --> 01:41:46.083]  And they said, oh, to heck with you.
[01:41:46.424 --> 01:41:47.205]  We're going to do this anyway.
[01:41:47.245 --> 01:41:51.610]  That's called the Delphi Method, where they claim they want your feedback and act like they're engaging you.
[01:41:54.522 --> 01:41:56.083]  You know, we've seen this over and over again.
[01:41:56.163 --> 01:42:07.849]  And describe where you come up with that 93% number, because the 93 and the 98% was in the newspaper, and then they'd have a meeting where 600 people show up and, you know, five people are there for it, and they all work for the toll road companies.
[01:42:07.889 --> 01:42:09.910]  But, I mean, let's go over some of that, then we'll take some calls.
[01:42:10.190 --> 01:42:16.133]  The feedback was about 6,000 people told them via phone or email
[01:42:16.773 --> 01:42:17.434]  All right.
[01:42:38.857 --> 01:42:41.318]  And that has upset the special interests.
[01:42:41.358 --> 01:42:48.421]  Now for those that don't understand, and this is another neocon mayor we've got, the same guy trying to shut down AXS TV right now, will win.
[01:42:48.441 --> 01:42:49.842]  Isn't that funny, he will win?
[01:42:50.402 --> 01:42:51.283]  And he did win.
[01:42:51.303 --> 01:43:02.627]  Now for those that aren't getting the big picture on this, it's very important to understand they just go in and buy up all your politicians and then just cram this down your throat.
[01:43:02.948 --> 01:43:03.148]  Right.
[01:43:04.868 --> 01:43:05.969]  That's exactly what's happened.
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:09.623]  And we're getting the details on that and we're posting that on our website.
[01:43:11.345 --> 01:43:13.547]  Well I think we should start toll parties all over the country.
[01:43:14.048 --> 01:43:17.471]  Yeah, well Houston Toll Party just started last week.
[01:43:17.511 --> 01:43:18.332]  We started that up.
[01:43:18.773 --> 01:43:19.674]  HoustonTollParty.com
[01:43:22.071 --> 01:43:23.473]  Well, it's very, very exciting.
[01:43:23.513 --> 01:43:25.276]  Let's talk to Roger in Pennsylvania.
[01:43:25.677 --> 01:43:26.658]  Roger, you're on the air.
[01:43:26.718 --> 01:43:27.319]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:43:27.339 --> 01:43:28.201]  Yeah, hi.
[01:43:28.241 --> 01:43:30.064]  Thanks, guys.
[01:43:30.324 --> 01:43:31.025]  Come on, folks.
[01:43:31.045 --> 01:43:35.512]  You're really going to need these polls to finance the expanding socialist gravy.
[01:43:35.732 --> 01:43:36.614]  Release money there, too.
[01:43:37.130 --> 01:43:45.695]  Because otherwise, you know, how are you going to get people's minds being tracked and controlled near as much if you don't preserve the illusion of taking care of them?
[01:43:45.955 --> 01:43:47.736]  Hey, Roger, this is the final phase.
[01:43:48.236 --> 01:44:01.063]  In the early phases worldwide, they socialize things, get people addicted, then they take the socialism away and hand the entire government over to private corporations, but it's not free market, it's lemon crony capitalism.
[01:44:03.154 --> 01:44:05.295]  Yeah, well, I'll save the other comment for later.
[01:44:05.335 --> 01:44:05.876]  God bless you.
[01:44:06.416 --> 01:44:07.236]  Well, is that it, Roger?
[01:44:07.596 --> 01:44:08.437]  Well, it was a little off.
[01:44:08.517 --> 01:44:11.038]  Well, I was going back to the socialism business.
[01:44:11.158 --> 01:44:13.880]  You know, you had a caller about five, six days ago.
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:15.400]  I think it's the same guy, actually.
[01:44:15.420 --> 01:44:17.121]  He calls different shows.
[01:44:17.141 --> 01:44:27.086]  And it was kind of entertaining because he was sort of agreeing with you about, you know, the presumably trying to overthrow Castro.
[01:44:27.166 --> 01:44:29.287]  Would that were so in both your and my view.
[01:44:29.767 --> 01:44:31.288]  You know, it was all just a ruse.
[01:44:32.396 --> 01:44:44.310]  And I forget what other dictator is trying to be undermined, but of course, the same guy would of course have to reject that Castro was installed by these same Illuminazis.
[01:44:44.971 --> 01:44:46.292]  This is a guy, I think his name is John.
[01:44:46.312 --> 01:44:48.114]  I hope he calls back and says, yeah, that was me.
[01:44:48.635 --> 01:44:52.059]  Anyway, just a few weeks, a couple months ago actually,
[01:44:52.728 --> 01:45:05.412]  He was on Dave & Joyce, and he was that rare commodity of an open, honest, communist-slash-socialist, all this Karl Marx was, and angles were misunderstood and never implemented, blah-di-blah-di-blah.
[01:45:06.493 --> 01:45:07.613]  Listen, Roger, I hear you.
[01:45:08.373 --> 01:45:11.074]  Let me just make a comment that makes me think of something here.
[01:45:12.034 --> 01:45:15.435]  There's something, a point I want to make, and I couldn't remember it, and you just brought it up.
[01:45:16.116 --> 01:45:19.797]  You've got the most extreme, ultra-left-wing people that are all against cars,
[01:45:20.589 --> 01:45:22.751]  And against, you know, fossil fuels, period.
[01:45:23.752 --> 01:45:29.476]  And they are teaming up with the big mega-corporations, just like when I went to Smart Growth Conferences.
[01:45:29.877 --> 01:45:34.100]  And then the mass of liberals, conservatives, libertarians are all against this plan.
[01:45:34.721 --> 01:45:37.283]  Any comments to that, Sal?
[01:45:37.743 --> 01:45:37.923]  Yep.
[01:45:39.145 --> 01:45:39.385]  Sorry?
[01:45:39.405 --> 01:45:46.691]  Do you have any comments about how we've got the ultra-super left-wingers who are actually for the plan, along with the big corporations?
[01:45:47.316 --> 01:45:52.319]  Well, it's hard to pin down politically who's for it here locally.
[01:45:53.420 --> 01:46:00.104]  Because there are Republicans and Democrats, and maverick Republicans and Democrats fighting it.
[01:46:01.625 --> 01:46:09.530]  And everybody that's running, except for the folks that are in power, they're running whole platforms against this toll plant.
[01:46:10.951 --> 01:46:13.773]  Hopefully they don't get bought out, but that's what happens.
[01:46:15.876 --> 01:46:21.721]  What about running somebody for mayor, who's a serious candidate, against Will Wynne?
[01:46:22.261 --> 01:46:23.022]  Maybe you'll run.
[01:46:24.463 --> 01:46:29.406]  Actually, I've had hundreds of people tell me they want me to run on a no-toll plan against Wynne.
[01:46:29.727 --> 01:46:30.227]  There you go.
[01:46:30.267 --> 01:46:32.089]  The problem is the electronic voting machines.
[01:46:32.129 --> 01:46:33.490]  That's a whole other subject.
[01:46:34.010 --> 01:46:36.712]  Those are owned by Clear Channel, which is owned by UT.
[01:46:38.013 --> 01:46:39.814]  You want to find another can of worms, sir?
[01:46:39.854 --> 01:46:41.216]  That rabbit hole goes very deep.
[01:46:41.596 --> 01:46:42.517]  Sure.
[01:46:42.577 --> 01:46:44.018]  Let's talk to Chris in Texas.
[01:46:44.038 --> 01:46:45.239]  Chris, you're on the air with our guest.
[01:46:45.259 --> 01:46:45.619]  Go ahead.
[01:46:46.371 --> 01:46:52.796]  Hi Alex, uh, Sal, it's a, you know, great, great, uh, great speech you guys are having today.
[01:46:53.717 --> 01:47:00.823]  Uh, I wanted to interject something real quick, a little bit off subject, but still with the whole police state thing that's going on.
[01:47:01.943 --> 01:47:11.171]  Uh, this past Saturday, I was, uh, outside UT, uh, the football game, uh, doing, uh, photography work.
[01:47:12.294 --> 01:47:19.236]  And basically, my First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, and Fifth Amendment were violated by the UT Police.
[01:47:20.776 --> 01:47:23.817]  Because you must be Al-Qaeda if you're videotaping a public event.
[01:47:24.137 --> 01:47:25.757]  Actually, it was still photography.
[01:47:26.998 --> 01:47:28.878]  But I'm being sarcastic.
[01:47:28.898 --> 01:47:32.499]  I mean, all over the country now, they videotape us, but we can't videotape them.
[01:47:32.719 --> 01:47:33.359]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:47:33.619 --> 01:47:40.781]  So anyways, there was a complaint made that it was indecent photography, at which there's
[01:47:41.468 --> 01:47:48.052]  You know, completely impossible since I was in broad daylight and in front of a crowd of spectators.
[01:47:48.233 --> 01:47:48.793]  So what do they do?
[01:47:48.873 --> 01:47:50.454]  Threaten to arrest you?
[01:47:50.854 --> 01:47:53.296]  Oh, it gets better.
[01:47:53.396 --> 01:47:59.320]  They come over and one of the officers approaches me and starts questioning me for identification.
[01:47:59.380 --> 01:48:00.981]  I said, you don't need that.
[01:48:01.061 --> 01:48:01.662]  Fifth Amendment.
[01:48:02.582 --> 01:48:03.963]  And, oh yes we do.
[01:48:04.924 --> 01:48:06.065]  We need to know who you are.
[01:48:06.085 --> 01:48:07.846]  I said, well who's the person that's
[01:48:08.376 --> 01:48:10.857]  That's making this false accusation against me.
[01:48:10.917 --> 01:48:12.418]  I want to know this person.
[01:48:12.558 --> 01:48:14.039]  Thanks to my accuser.
[01:48:14.479 --> 01:48:15.720]  Oh, well you don't need to know that.
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:17.040]  That's none of your business.
[01:48:18.181 --> 01:48:21.683]  And so, it went on for this for a little bit.
[01:48:21.743 --> 01:48:23.404]  Next thing I know, I'm thrown to the ground.
[01:48:23.824 --> 01:48:25.405]  Well, you're resisting arrest.
[01:48:26.205 --> 01:48:27.586]  You refused to give us ID.
[01:48:28.546 --> 01:48:30.147]  We didn't see your papers, sir.
[01:48:31.328 --> 01:48:38.071]  So, next thing I know, I'm arraigned on two misdemeanor charges, which is all
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:39.280]  Well, crap.
[01:48:39.820 --> 01:48:41.300]  Because of the... Yeah.
[01:48:41.681 --> 01:48:43.101]  So did they take your film?
[01:48:43.541 --> 01:48:45.181]  They took the camera, everything.
[01:48:45.641 --> 01:48:47.081]  I mean, there's nothing incriminating.
[01:48:47.742 --> 01:48:55.763]  And... But I mean, as far as the whole instance was instigated because they're trying to trample on your First Amendment rights.
[01:48:56.023 --> 01:48:56.683]  Oh, exactly.
[01:48:56.703 --> 01:48:57.723]  This happens everywhere now.
[01:48:57.783 --> 01:48:58.763]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[01:48:58.944 --> 01:48:59.624]  And that's what I'm saying.
[01:48:59.664 --> 01:49:02.504]  Police state right here in Austin at UT.
[01:49:03.264 --> 01:49:07.385]  And, you know, I never felt so violated of my freedoms and liberties
[01:49:07.941 --> 01:49:08.942]  As I did that day.
[01:49:09.022 --> 01:49:23.460]  I mean, I've, I've been, you know, rough areas of neighborhoods, uh, you know, Chicago, New York, whatever, uh, but I, I was seriously mugged, and I had my stuff stolen, just as, as a gang of thugs jumped me and...
[01:49:25.641 --> 01:49:26.402]  I hear the music.
[01:49:26.582 --> 01:49:27.522]  Yeah, thanks for the call.
[01:49:27.562 --> 01:49:28.082]  Anything else?
[01:49:28.142 --> 01:49:33.144]  I mean, I'm going to put you on hold until later then, because we need to talk a little bit about the toll roads.
[01:49:33.164 --> 01:49:40.046]  I mean, I understand what happened to you was wrong and bad, but I want to take a few calls from people that want to talk about the toll roads, and I'll try to get back to you later.
[01:49:40.626 --> 01:49:41.666]  I'm sorry this happened to you.
[01:49:41.706 --> 01:49:42.747]  It happens to everybody now.
[01:49:42.807 --> 01:49:43.767]  It's part of the new freedom.
[01:49:44.327 --> 01:49:50.589]  Cameras in our hands are terroristic and evil, and in their hands they're good, and they're now putting them in school bathrooms and police locker rooms.
[01:49:51.129 --> 01:49:52.570]  So they videotape us in the bathroom,
[01:49:53.593 --> 01:49:55.054]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.274 --> 01:49:58.355]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.496 --> 01:50:02.398]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.438 --> 01:50:06.680]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:10.782]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:10.882 --> 01:50:12.743]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:16.006 --> 01:50:20.971]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.151 --> 01:50:24.214]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.374 --> 01:50:27.257]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.738 --> 01:50:33.864]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.384 --> 01:50:38.166]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[01:50:38.566 --> 01:50:39.926]  Order your video today.
[01:50:40.306 --> 01:50:41.327]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[01:50:41.347 --> 01:50:43.668]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[01:50:43.688 --> 01:50:44.928]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[01:50:52.811 --> 01:50:54.772]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:50:54.852 --> 01:51:05.577]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:51:05.937 --> 01:51:10.479]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:51:10.539 --> 01:51:21.864]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:51:22.464 --> 01:51:29.309]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:51:29.709 --> 01:51:31.850]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:51:32.331 --> 01:51:37.314]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 hose filter elements.
[01:51:37.614 --> 01:51:43.918]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:43.999 --> 01:51:48.161]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:51:48.401 --> 01:51:49.222]  That's toll free.
[01:51:49.242 --> 01:51:49.282]  888-803-4438.
[01:51:52.284 --> 01:51:54.627]  I think so.
[01:52:09.827 --> 01:52:10.487]  We're good to go!

[01:52:59.047 --> 01:53:06.112]  Alright, Chris and Ed and others who aren't for our guests will get to you later in the next hour, early in the next hour, and get to a bunch of other important news.
[01:53:06.132 --> 01:53:07.813]  But we're talking about the toll roads right now.
[01:53:08.413 --> 01:53:11.415]  Kim and Roy and others want to talk to you, Sal.
[01:53:11.455 --> 01:53:13.737]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kim in Texas.
[01:53:13.777 --> 01:53:14.477]  Kim, you're on the air.
[01:53:14.517 --> 01:53:14.937]  Go ahead.
[01:53:15.778 --> 01:53:16.278]  Hi, Alex.
[01:53:16.298 --> 01:53:17.279]  How are you doing today?
[01:53:18.621 --> 01:53:18.901]  Great.
[01:53:19.302 --> 01:53:24.626]  I haven't heard you guys mention an amendment, actually H.R.
[01:53:24.907 --> 01:53:24.626]  1072.
[01:53:24.987 --> 01:53:26.128]  Are you familiar with that?
[01:53:27.209 --> 01:53:29.691]  I've heard of it, but I don't know enough about it.
[01:53:29.711 --> 01:53:30.812]  Do you want to tell us a little about it?
[01:53:31.713 --> 01:53:38.038]  Actually, it's an amendment to the Transportation Act that actually put the MPOs into existence.
[01:53:38.219 --> 01:53:38.379]  Yes.
[01:53:41.474 --> 01:53:56.046]  It specifically spells out an objective to have tolls from city to city nationwide and it specifically says in there that it wants each car to have a toll tag and this is supposed to be for environmental reasons.
[01:53:56.066 --> 01:53:59.829]  Well yeah, that's what I got back in 98 with the federal plan.
[01:54:00.149 --> 01:54:02.231]  Why don't you email that to us now?
[01:54:02.891 --> 01:54:09.877]  I'm going to and the other thing that's in there that's very interesting is apparently right now they cannot toll existing highways.
[01:54:10.854 --> 01:54:16.138]  This bill, or this amendment, would allow them to, you know, toll I-35 if they wanted to.
[01:54:16.278 --> 01:54:27.085]  And to understand what they do, they just go replace a bridge and then turn the whole road into a toll road and say, oh, well this bridge is new, so to go across this 100-yard bridge, you're going to have to pay a toll.
[01:54:27.525 --> 01:54:30.367]  Yeah, but with this, you won't even have to do anything new.
[01:54:30.627 --> 01:54:31.988]  They can put it on existing.
[01:54:32.189 --> 01:54:33.029]  That's correct.
[01:54:33.049 --> 01:54:37.172]  That's what 3588 allows them to place a toll on anything we've already paid.
[01:54:37.634 --> 01:54:38.795]  Any of our highways, yes.
[01:54:39.155 --> 01:54:40.316]  Right, exactly.
[01:54:40.336 --> 01:54:46.159]  And that's HR 1072, and I will go to your site and email that to you.
[01:54:46.259 --> 01:54:47.340]  It's pretty amazing.
[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:49.921]  And just one other quick thing, Alex, for you.
[01:54:49.941 --> 01:54:54.864]  I saw something real interesting today when I was driving down 35 near William Cannon.
[01:54:55.724 --> 01:54:58.546]  There's a big police van sitting on the side of the road.
[01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:02.941]  And it says, now hiring, with the big yellow sign.
[01:55:04.061 --> 01:55:05.901]  And I thought that was the craziest thing I'd ever seen.
[01:55:05.921 --> 01:55:07.342]  Well, it's just we need more police.
[01:55:07.442 --> 01:55:09.782]  I mean, literally everywhere, crawling all over us.
[01:55:10.562 --> 01:55:19.544]  Well, and I just heard your caller talk about the photograph, and I went over and took a picture of it, and I have to tell you, I was actually afraid when I was over there doing that.
[01:55:19.684 --> 01:55:25.665]  Doing that, and that's just ridiculous that I would feel afraid that I would be getting in trouble for taking a picture of something like that.
[01:55:26.365 --> 01:55:28.607]  But I did feel like I was afraid.
[01:55:29.267 --> 01:55:30.668]  Yeah, we should ask the police.
[01:55:30.888 --> 01:55:35.111]  Why do they sell video cameras at Circuit City and Best Buy?
[01:55:35.131 --> 01:55:42.076]  Why, if somebody goes down to UT for the football game and is taking pictures, why do you come over and rough them up?
[01:55:42.456 --> 01:55:46.759]  I mean, I was in New York, but I've been all over the country before 9-11 had them turn that camera off.
[01:55:47.079 --> 01:55:48.420]  Well, no, it's my First Amendment.
[01:55:49.461 --> 01:55:53.904]  But now, well, we're going to go ahead and beat you up because you might be Al-Qaeda.
[01:55:55.303 --> 01:55:56.223]  Thanks for the call, Kim.
[01:55:56.243 --> 01:55:56.803]  Great points.
[01:55:56.884 --> 01:56:00.364]  And email that to me as well, that state law.
[01:56:00.625 --> 01:56:01.685]  I've got the federal plan.
[01:56:02.345 --> 01:56:03.805]  Let's talk to Roy in Texas.
[01:56:03.925 --> 01:56:04.746]  Roy, you're on the air.
[01:56:04.786 --> 01:56:05.246]  Go ahead.
[01:56:05.266 --> 01:56:06.226]  Hello.
[01:56:06.306 --> 01:56:09.687]  I'd like to talk about the historical origin of our roads.
[01:56:09.827 --> 01:56:14.868]  Originally, the roadway was deeded for... Defense Department.
[01:56:15.829 --> 01:56:24.191]  Well, also, the local ones and around were deeded for preserving our physical liberty or our inalienable right to travel.
[01:56:25.277 --> 01:56:29.060]  And this looks to me like a 42 suit violation.
[01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:36.626]  Need a class action against these people for violating their oath of office in a treasonous way and also exceeding their authority.
[01:56:39.228 --> 01:56:39.989]  Well, you're right.
[01:56:40.049 --> 01:56:44.192]  I mean, slaves can't travel and these are checkpoints, folks, not just toll roads.
[01:56:44.772 --> 01:56:45.593]  Comments, Sal?
[01:56:46.674 --> 01:56:50.517]  I think it's... I'm writing it down and when I meet with the lawyers tomorrow night, I'll bring it up to them.
[01:56:51.097 --> 01:56:53.139]  Alright, I just wanted to get it out there, everybody.
[01:56:53.658 --> 01:56:53.958]  Thank you.
[01:56:53.978 --> 01:56:56.019]  Well, you might need to talk to a different type of lawyer, too.
[01:56:56.039 --> 01:56:59.681]  I don't know which group you're talking to, but, you know, it could be corporate, it could be... Oh, yeah.
[01:56:59.701 --> 01:57:01.462]  And I would agree, this is a civil rights suit.
[01:57:01.902 --> 01:57:02.182]  Yes.
[01:57:04.943 --> 01:57:05.904]  Well, good point, Roy.
[01:57:06.064 --> 01:57:06.924]  Thank you for the call.
[01:57:06.944 --> 01:57:15.948]  We're going to break, do five more minutes with our guest, take a few more calls on the subject of toll roads, which are an integral part of the police state.
[01:57:15.968 --> 01:57:16.468]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:16.508 --> 01:57:17.669]  You want to specifically talk
[01:57:23.248 --> 01:57:23.769]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.341 --> 01:57:52.382]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.102 --> 01:57:54.202]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.863 --> 01:57:55.703]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.723 --> 01:57:57.324]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.344 --> 01:58:01.806]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.186 --> 01:58:06.328]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.348 --> 01:58:18.434]  Right here in Texas, we're going to have 6,000 miles of toll roads on existing roads when the whole nation has 7,000 miles.
[01:58:20.330 --> 01:58:25.435]  I've been on toll roads in Kansas and other states where for hundreds of miles they shut down everything.
[01:58:25.475 --> 01:58:27.197]  You cannot exit to all these old towns.
[01:58:27.577 --> 01:58:28.839]  It turns them into ghost towns.
[01:58:28.859 --> 01:58:31.882]  They're going to have transponders in the vehicles that track and trace you.
[01:58:31.942 --> 01:58:33.543]  It's the admitted federal plan.
[01:58:33.563 --> 01:58:36.146]  They're going to tax you on every road you travel on.
[01:58:37.087 --> 01:58:39.569]  And just in Austin, Texas between $1,800 and $2,000 a year per car just to drive.
[01:58:44.835 --> 01:58:47.398]  Now, this is the new system, and it violates your privacy.
[01:58:47.618 --> 01:58:50.161]  But they claim it's a privilege to drive, so there is no privacy.
[01:58:51.202 --> 01:58:52.163]  This is the new freedom.
[01:58:53.525 --> 01:59:04.557]  When we come back in the next segment, we'll go to these loaded phone lines, all the other folks that are patiently holding, but finishing up with Sal Castillo, who has owned his own advertising and marketing company for 13 years.
[01:59:05.965 --> 01:59:07.446]  He's lived in Austin for five years.
[01:59:07.486 --> 01:59:11.688]  Before that, he lived in North Carolina, Florida, New York.
[01:59:11.748 --> 01:59:15.090]  Knows about transportation from different areas.
[01:59:15.270 --> 01:59:17.231]  93% of Austinites and Poles are against it.
[01:59:17.251 --> 01:59:18.472]  98% in Houston.
[01:59:18.992 --> 01:59:20.333]  The government says, we don't care.
[01:59:20.433 --> 01:59:24.956]  And they're going to hand it over, the already paid for roads, to private corporations to profit off of it.
[01:59:24.976 --> 01:59:25.816]  It's not free market.
[01:59:26.137 --> 01:59:26.777]  It's fascism.
[01:59:27.409 --> 01:59:29.370]  You got just a few minutes left here, Sal.
[01:59:29.690 --> 01:59:31.330]  Let's say, you know, you were on a local station.
[01:59:31.350 --> 01:59:33.351]  You had three minutes to present what's happening.
[01:59:33.871 --> 01:59:35.592]  One more time, go over the facts for us.
[01:59:35.992 --> 01:59:42.374]  Well, I'd basically say that they asked the public for what they felt, and the public said no.
[01:59:42.554 --> 01:59:43.535]  They're doing it anyway.
[01:59:44.175 --> 01:59:47.076]  We're fighting it with AustinTollParty.com.
[01:59:47.096 --> 01:59:50.117]  There's a five-step solution.
[01:59:56.789 --> 01:59:58.269]  You know, we're doing everything we can.
[01:59:58.309 --> 02:00:05.932]  We've got a recall rally that's coming up on the 18th, and if you go to the site and do step one, you'll get details about it.
[02:00:07.652 --> 02:00:21.296]  On the 28th of this month, the Texas Transportation Commission will approve a whole bunch of cities' plans, and that's why I'm hoping our lawyers step up and do something before the 28th.
[02:00:21.356 --> 02:00:24.217]  Yeah, you might need to file some type of injunction.
[02:00:24.457 --> 02:00:24.897]  Exactly.
[02:00:26.039 --> 02:00:26.539]  Exactly.
[02:00:28.219 --> 02:00:37.961]  You know, we're talking about, you know, five, six lawyers that have volunteered, and now we're trying to get another firm in to actually carry the ball with all the research they've done.
[02:00:38.841 --> 02:00:41.282]  So this is the month that I hope that happens.
[02:00:42.402 --> 02:00:46.563]  But we're looking... But in a nutshell, why these toll roads are different?
[02:00:47.343 --> 02:00:50.823]  Well, these toll roads are different because they're using our tax dollars to build them.
[02:00:51.183 --> 02:00:55.224]  They're also placing them on our daily highways.
[02:00:55.896 --> 02:01:00.337]  And by the way, they always say that you can have free access down below where all the lights are.
[02:01:00.718 --> 02:01:10.141]  But we found an internal text doc presentation that they use that proved they're going to force us up onto the toll roads, and that's on our site as well.
[02:01:12.421 --> 02:01:14.282]  You mean government is lying?
[02:01:16.083 --> 02:01:16.963]  Shockingly, yes.
[02:01:17.283 --> 02:01:22.805]  But by connecting ourselves, and so far almost 5,000 people have gone to the site.
[02:01:22.845 --> 02:01:23.745]  We've got their emails.
[02:01:24.284 --> 02:01:28.708]  By connecting ourselves, we're going to have a list of endorsements of who we're going to endorse.
[02:01:28.988 --> 02:01:32.051]  The people that are out there fighting to stop this plan.
[02:01:32.171 --> 02:01:34.714]  Now by that, you've gotten 5,000 people that signed up.
[02:01:34.994 --> 02:01:36.015]  That signed up, correct.
[02:01:36.596 --> 02:01:41.437]  Yeah, well, I think 5,000 should go sign up right now at AustinTollRoads.com.
[02:01:41.577 --> 02:01:43.257]  AustinTollParty.com.
[02:01:43.717 --> 02:01:45.298]  Yes, AustinTollParty.com.
[02:01:46.278 --> 02:01:46.678]  Pardon me.
[02:01:47.438 --> 02:01:48.338]  It's a great site.
[02:01:48.358 --> 02:01:49.199]  They can see the maps.
[02:01:49.219 --> 02:01:50.979]  But this is a national plan, folks.
[02:01:51.439 --> 02:01:57.340]  It's just we've got Rick Perry here doing this to us in Texas, and Austin is just going to be totally overloaded with these.
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:01:58.900]  Again, upwards of $2,000 a year per car.
[02:02:01.881 --> 02:02:04.624]  And I can't go a mile in any direction.
[02:02:04.704 --> 02:02:09.368]  I can't go a quarter mile in one direction without getting on a toll road where I live.
[02:02:09.728 --> 02:02:11.350]  Property values are plummeting.
[02:02:11.890 --> 02:02:15.013]  And you said TxDOT told you, hey, we don't care.
[02:02:15.033 --> 02:02:19.838]  Yeah, I was in a neighborhood meeting and basically folks said, hey, what about our home values?
[02:02:19.858 --> 02:02:20.939]  And they said, well, we do roads.
[02:02:20.999 --> 02:02:22.040]  We don't do home values.
[02:02:22.060 --> 02:02:23.321]  We don't know if they're going to go up or down.
[02:02:25.658 --> 02:02:26.218]  Nice answer.
[02:02:26.558 --> 02:02:32.761]  Well, I would swear in an affidavit, then, that they said that, and you've got witnesses, and that's a reason for an injunction right there.
[02:02:33.461 --> 02:02:33.721]  Yeah.
[02:02:34.001 --> 02:02:35.341]  And I guarantee, this is amazing.
[02:02:35.421 --> 02:02:40.443]  Alright, well, Sal, I'm going to have you on the TV show Wednesday night, and I appreciate you joining us.
[02:02:40.683 --> 02:02:41.003]  Thank you, sir.
[02:02:41.023 --> 02:02:42.164]  You're doing a great job.
[02:02:42.184 --> 02:02:42.644]  We'll be back.
[02:02:45.766 --> 02:02:49.749]  Are you concerned about the quality of air and purity of water in your household?

[02:04:03.109 --> 02:04:11.012]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:04:11.372 --> 02:04:11.813]  I think so.

[02:04:43.763 --> 02:04:48.105]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:04:48.305 --> 02:04:52.707]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:04:52.847 --> 02:04:57.229]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:04:57.269 --> 02:04:58.630]  The New World Order.
[02:04:59.390 --> 02:05:00.171]  Panama.
[02:05:00.412 --> 02:05:04.656]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:05:04.696 --> 02:05:11.644]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:05:11.764 --> 02:05:13.787]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:05:14.187 --> 02:05:24.574]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:05:24.774 --> 02:05:30.158]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:05:45.370 --> 02:05:50.411]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.771 --> 02:05:53.112]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:55.753 --> 02:06:00.614]  We're here, my friends, fighting to stop this enslavement grid from being put in place.
[02:06:01.354 --> 02:06:04.875]  As we watch it being constructed all around us, the
[02:06:07.677 --> 02:06:11.000]  Broadcast can be heard Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:11.801]  until 2 p.m.
[02:06:12.261 --> 02:06:14.824]  Central Standard Time during the day, three hours.
[02:06:15.384 --> 02:06:18.087]  And then back from 9 to midnight, Central Standard Time.
[02:06:19.548 --> 02:06:23.452]  And Austin to have more toll roads than any other city in the country.
[02:06:23.552 --> 02:06:27.416]  Every major road, every major side street cannot go anywhere without getting on them.
[02:06:27.976 --> 02:06:28.477]  Upwards of $2,000 a year.
[02:06:30.962 --> 02:06:36.330]  And then the state's going to have them and deny access to all the towns on the highways and byways.
[02:06:36.390 --> 02:06:38.032]  I mean, I've been to places where they've done this.
[02:06:38.873 --> 02:06:40.235]  And Governor Rick Perry's doing it.
[02:06:40.255 --> 02:06:42.218]  He's got all the radical environmentalists behind him.
[02:06:42.238 --> 02:06:42.618]  Why is that?
[02:06:42.638 --> 02:06:44.741]  But then all the Democrats and Republicans, 93%, are against it.
[02:06:47.483 --> 02:06:51.845]  Because the so-called environmental groups, folks, time and time again are controlled by the big corporations.
[02:06:52.166 --> 02:07:03.511]  They use it to take control of the people's wealth, of the people's land, of the people's resources, and open domain, and then they hand it over a month later, when we forget about it, to the private corporations.
[02:07:03.551 --> 02:07:09.995]  And all these toll roads to be run, and operated, and the profits to be going to private companies, and never even put the money up for it.
[02:07:11.295 --> 02:07:15.898]  They come into an existing major highway, and they go to one bridge, and they
[02:07:17.026 --> 02:07:22.788]  retrofit it to get around the law saying that it's not an existing road and then you have this little bitty toll road.
[02:07:22.848 --> 02:07:25.589]  Just a little checkpoint to go through to be able to continue down the road.
[02:07:27.110 --> 02:07:27.910]  This is incredible.
[02:07:27.950 --> 02:07:35.673]  This isn't to build some new existing road and then you have the toll road for ten years and then you take the tolls out.
[02:07:35.773 --> 02:07:38.054]  No, this is the new New World Order toll road.
[02:07:40.435 --> 02:07:41.936]  And all over the country it's happening.
[02:07:41.956 --> 02:07:44.837]  You heard the lady earlier who called in Kim and I've seen those documents.
[02:07:45.699 --> 02:07:47.740]  Where this is to be a national tax.
[02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:50.601]  They're going to do this federally, state, and at the local level.
[02:07:50.861 --> 02:07:56.763]  You'll be paying all these taxes, and by law you'll have a transponder in your car tracking and tracing everything you do, where you go.
[02:07:57.143 --> 02:07:58.964]  And now they're talking about satellite boxes.
[02:07:59.984 --> 02:08:01.545]  So it isn't coming down the road.
[02:08:01.645 --> 02:08:02.845]  It's here for me.
[02:08:03.406 --> 02:08:08.828]  It's 400 yards from my house, where I live.
[02:08:10.508 --> 02:08:12.909]  And the property values have already plummeted.
[02:08:13.669 --> 02:08:15.090]  Everywhere where the toll roads are at.
[02:08:16.374 --> 02:08:17.035]  And do they care?
[02:08:17.055 --> 02:08:22.058]  Do they care if your $200,000 house is now worth $100,000, literally?
[02:08:22.398 --> 02:08:24.540]  Do they care if your $300,000 house is worth $150,000?
[02:08:24.660 --> 02:08:27.862]  No, they don't care, folks.
[02:08:28.443 --> 02:08:29.523]  This isn't free market.
[02:08:29.583 --> 02:08:31.265]  This is a looting of the economy.
[02:08:32.706 --> 02:08:41.512]  The layoffs to high-tech workers are going to get seven times more expansive than they already are, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
[02:08:43.159 --> 02:08:47.703]  The unskilled worker jobs, those are, the wages are plunging there.
[02:08:48.624 --> 02:08:51.527]  The economy is shutting down, but Walmart is expanding.
[02:08:51.887 --> 02:08:56.631]  The oil companies are registering record profits, but oh, they're not behind the high oil prices.
[02:08:57.212 --> 02:09:01.496]  And then on top of this, you're going to be paying to drive your car a giant electronic tax.
[02:09:02.617 --> 02:09:04.098]  That also violates your privacy.
[02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:09.863]  And this is just one facet of all the different police state things that are happening.
[02:09:11.488 --> 02:09:15.449]  And by the way, for police out there, you're going to be paying the toll with you and your family, too.
[02:09:16.969 --> 02:09:20.310]  Firefighters, government bureaucrats, you're all going to be paying, too.
[02:09:20.350 --> 02:09:21.470]  You're all going to be slaves, too.
[02:09:22.291 --> 02:09:24.431]  But I guess in the polls, none of us are for it.
[02:09:24.451 --> 02:09:27.452]  93% in Austin.
[02:09:27.472 --> 02:09:29.752]  98% in major polls in Houston.
[02:09:29.772 --> 02:09:32.473]  And they've even got a smaller plan than this.
[02:09:33.273 --> 02:09:34.974]  All part of the larger federal plan.
[02:09:35.794 --> 02:09:36.794]  Administered at the state level.
[02:09:38.197 --> 02:09:42.100]  Well then why are the politicians saying, we don't care if you claim you're going to vote us out.
[02:09:42.340 --> 02:09:44.022]  We don't claim that there's going to be a recall.
[02:09:44.322 --> 02:09:45.103]  Ha ha ha!
[02:09:45.423 --> 02:09:50.387]  Because we put in electronic voting machines that are admittedly fraud based.
[02:09:50.707 --> 02:09:55.091]  We've caught the people who run the machines in fraud before and nothing happens to them.
[02:09:55.291 --> 02:09:58.654]  You see, that's why the tyranny is going to get so bad, so quick.
[02:09:59.394 --> 02:10:03.938]  And then if the 98% of you or the 93% of you want to go out and have a big protest?
[02:10:05.131 --> 02:10:07.712]  Of, you know, 300,000 of you in your city or town?
[02:10:08.213 --> 02:10:11.675]  Well, they'll just send a provocateur out who will light fire to a trash can.
[02:10:12.095 --> 02:10:14.236]  That person will go back into the police line.
[02:10:14.916 --> 02:10:25.862]  Then they will suddenly open fire on you with rubber bullets and microwave guns and sound cannons and ride their horses over you and ride their armored vehicles over you and put you in their little FEMA camps they built in every major city.
[02:10:26.142 --> 02:10:27.203]  I've got an idea, cops.
[02:10:27.463 --> 02:10:28.804]  How about you're not part of that?
[02:10:29.384 --> 02:10:31.045]  How about you don't go along with that?
[02:10:32.483 --> 02:10:36.406]  They geared up the oppression mechanisms, then they put in the oppression.
[02:10:40.250 --> 02:10:43.533]  And regardless of where you live, these plans are unfolding.
[02:10:43.553 --> 02:10:46.695]  Alright, let's go back to Chris in Texas.
[02:10:47.116 --> 02:10:57.705]  We were trying to stay on topic with our guest about toll roads, and he called in about how he was downtown UT, no logins, photographing outside the UT football game.
[02:10:57.745 --> 02:10:58.445]  I've done it myself.
[02:10:58.465 --> 02:11:00.087]  I've been down there videotaping a hundred times.
[02:11:01.024 --> 02:11:11.507]  I've been down there once, videotaping stuff, and police came over and went after him and he got arrested and got charged with a bunch of stuff.
[02:11:12.127 --> 02:11:13.548]  Go ahead and finish up what you wanted to say.
[02:11:14.608 --> 02:11:29.973]  Well, I also wanted to ask if your listeners out there might have been witnesses to this horrific scene that morning, maybe they could call in and also help out in some kind of way because
[02:11:30.814 --> 02:11:33.537]  As they were taking me down, I was definitely screaming for help.
[02:11:33.997 --> 02:11:38.481]  And the only help I ended up having was six other officers jumping on top.
[02:11:39.302 --> 02:11:43.987]  Now again, all you said was, go back over this.
[02:11:44.007 --> 02:11:44.927]  This is the new freedom.
[02:11:45.288 --> 02:11:48.931]  You're down there videotaping, or taking still photos.
[02:11:49.071 --> 02:11:50.593]  Describe what you were taking photos of.
[02:11:51.754 --> 02:11:53.355]  Basically, spectators.
[02:11:53.856 --> 02:11:54.917]  People go into the crowd.
[02:11:55.792 --> 02:12:02.736]  And I have like a business card of the website that they could go to to retrieve the pictures if they want to purchase them.
[02:12:03.216 --> 02:12:06.158]  If they don't want to purchase them, the pictures are deleted after 30 days.
[02:12:06.558 --> 02:12:10.881]  Okay, so UT didn't like you down there engaging in a business that everybody's engaged in.
[02:12:11.021 --> 02:12:18.965]  I mean, 200 years ago, somebody would walk up to you and say, would you like me to sketch a portrait of you, you know, for however many shekels.
[02:12:19.425 --> 02:12:20.046]  Right.
[02:12:20.186 --> 02:12:22.147]  So you're down there, and then what happened?
[02:12:23.661 --> 02:12:28.643]  I guess some woman, maybe she was with somebody she shouldn't have been.
[02:12:29.183 --> 02:12:29.724]  I don't know.
[02:12:29.864 --> 02:12:35.026]  That's not known for certain.
[02:12:35.126 --> 02:12:39.067]  But anyways, some complaint was made to a UT officer.
[02:12:39.087 --> 02:12:46.330]  The UT officer then approached me and pushed me for identification and I refused.
[02:12:47.090 --> 02:12:48.451]  And we went into
[02:12:49.726 --> 02:12:50.426]  This whole debate.
[02:12:50.846 --> 02:12:57.489]  So you said, I have a Fifth Amendment, and he said, no you don't, and then... Basically, and he said, no, you have to identify yourself with us.
[02:12:58.069 --> 02:13:00.810]  I said, no, I don't feel I have to.
[02:13:01.790 --> 02:13:05.271]  Now, let me stop you, because you already told this story last hour.
[02:13:05.291 --> 02:13:10.233]  So they tackle you, six of them jump on you, they charge you with resisting arrest, and what else?
[02:13:11.773 --> 02:13:12.954]  Refusal to give ID.
[02:13:13.254 --> 02:13:14.054]  Okay, now,
[02:13:14.805 --> 02:13:17.085]  UT is one of the most surveilled campuses in the country.
[02:13:17.146 --> 02:13:20.646]  I guarantee you were on probably 10, 15, maybe 20 cameras.
[02:13:21.046 --> 02:13:28.628]  Try subpoenaing their own digital video showing you didn't resist, and they're going to tell you, no way, baby.
[02:13:29.088 --> 02:13:30.648]  But you need to go ahead and take it to court.
[02:13:30.688 --> 02:13:31.508]  Go ahead and demand it.
[02:13:31.548 --> 02:13:32.629]  You may be able to force them.
[02:13:32.949 --> 02:13:37.750]  Then magically, when you get the tapes, that part would have magically been erased by accident.
[02:13:38.030 --> 02:13:39.570]  We've seen this 50 times here in Austin.
[02:13:39.810 --> 02:13:40.110]  Right.
[02:13:40.190 --> 02:13:43.352]  But just to illustrate this for yourself and others, show this.
[02:13:43.392 --> 02:13:46.673]  But you need to demand a jury trial.
[02:13:47.013 --> 02:13:49.114]  You need to try to get any witnesses that were there.
[02:13:49.655 --> 02:13:50.755]  What you're doing is smart.
[02:13:52.116 --> 02:13:58.579]  Anybody who wants to call in or who saw this, but if they were football fans, they probably don't care.
[02:13:58.699 --> 02:13:59.659]  I'm being sarcastic, folks.
[02:13:59.699 --> 02:14:02.541]  I played football, but you got the spectators going down there.
[02:14:02.921 --> 02:14:05.722]  So after they arrested you and put you in cuffs, what did they say to you?
[02:14:06.222 --> 02:14:09.364]  Well, as I had one cuff on one hand,
[02:14:10.191 --> 02:14:13.233]  I couldn't give the other hand because it's underneath my chest.
[02:14:13.573 --> 02:14:15.534]  They're like, you're resisting, you're not giving us your hand.
[02:14:16.074 --> 02:14:18.275]  And meanwhile, more of their... Now that's a favorite game.
[02:14:18.355 --> 02:14:23.918]  While they jump up and down on you like 800 pound gorillas, they'll demand you to give them the hand that they're sitting on.
[02:14:24.738 --> 02:14:30.221]  And, of course, that was the handcuffed hand, so it left, what's today, Tuesday?
[02:14:30.601 --> 02:14:32.482]  I still have bloody marks from it.
[02:14:32.987 --> 02:14:34.807]  From where the cuffs cut into my skin.
[02:14:35.028 --> 02:14:44.510]  Okay, but so the Lordships, because they had your arms pinned, and this is a favorite tactic, the Lordships then finally got your other hand.
[02:14:44.530 --> 02:14:45.230]  What happened next?
[02:14:45.530 --> 02:14:56.313]  Of course, you know, then basically I asked for medical assistance, which it took a while for anybody from a medic.
[02:14:56.413 --> 02:14:58.473]  Let me just finish up, because I've got to go to other calls.
[02:14:58.754 --> 02:14:58.994]  Sure.
[02:14:59.134 --> 02:15:00.514]  What was the last thing they said to you?
[02:15:02.042 --> 02:15:09.026]  I don't know about the last thing because then I ended up having to go for booking and all of those.
[02:15:09.046 --> 02:15:10.587]  No, I mean the arresting officer.
[02:15:10.607 --> 02:15:14.229]  You didn't say something like, that'll teach you, boy.
[02:15:14.249 --> 02:15:17.291]  I don't know, probably something like that.
[02:15:17.591 --> 02:15:18.512]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[02:15:18.612 --> 02:15:19.372]  I appreciate the call.
[02:15:20.113 --> 02:15:21.494]  Yeah, that's the New America, folks.
[02:15:21.534 --> 02:15:27.457]  I've been out there doing an interview in front of the Texas Capitol and cops walk over and say, what are you doing videotaping?
[02:15:28.246 --> 02:15:30.067]  You know, well, I'm a news guy.
[02:15:30.127 --> 02:15:32.868]  Well, hmm, maybe, hmm.
[02:15:33.489 --> 02:15:34.609]  They're setting that precedent.
[02:15:34.629 --> 02:15:36.070]  They don't like it that we all have cameras.
[02:15:36.850 --> 02:15:39.392]  Let's go ahead and talk to another caller.
[02:15:40.692 --> 02:15:43.954]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ed.
[02:15:43.974 --> 02:15:46.635]  Ed, where are you calling us from?
[02:15:47.296 --> 02:15:47.896]  I'm from L.A.
[02:15:48.236 --> 02:15:48.576]  Welcome.
[02:15:49.257 --> 02:15:51.018]  Hi, it's an honor to talk to you, Alex.
[02:15:52.438 --> 02:15:54.019]  I want to ask you two questions.
[02:15:54.299 --> 02:15:57.761]  I want to ask you, what do you think about the Ludwig von Mises Institute?
[02:15:58.842 --> 02:16:00.823]  An economist like the late Marie Rothbard?
[02:16:01.064 --> 02:16:01.684]  Yeah, I know.
[02:16:02.104 --> 02:16:07.908]  Well, it's a libertarian think tank, and they're against the Federal Reserve, and I think they're pretty good.
[02:16:08.848 --> 02:16:23.937]  I also want to ask you, how do you think, what ways can we use to privatize things like roads and a lot of these other government institutions, but do them in a way where corporate New World Order elites don't get their hands on it?
[02:16:24.497 --> 02:16:25.878]  Yeah, but see, that's the problem.
[02:16:27.246 --> 02:16:38.250]  The corporations are not free market and it's not free market to take roads we've paid for and then slap toll roads on it and give it to their political cronies that put them in office and then they gouge us.
[02:16:39.150 --> 02:16:42.831]  That's just... The corporations are bigger than government now, folks.
[02:16:43.111 --> 02:16:48.013]  They're just becoming the government and acting like governments and engaging in monopolistic practices.
[02:16:48.793 --> 02:16:50.654]  So no, I think the roads should be public
[02:16:52.074 --> 02:16:59.539]  If the government wants to have open books and make you pay for a new road with a toll, that's fine.
[02:17:00.540 --> 02:17:01.501]  That's not what they're doing.
[02:17:01.561 --> 02:17:02.582]  It's in perpetuity.
[02:17:02.922 --> 02:17:05.143]  All the existing roads will be toll roads.
[02:17:06.204 --> 02:17:09.146]  I don't know if you're familiar with Walter Block, the economist?
[02:17:09.586 --> 02:17:10.107]  Yes, I am.
[02:17:10.907 --> 02:17:18.292]  He talks about privatizing roads using something similar to Repartee theory, that they use for large bodies of water.
[02:17:18.552 --> 02:17:18.772]  Yes.
[02:17:20.294 --> 02:17:21.554]  I was wondering what you thought about that.
[02:17:23.775 --> 02:17:30.216]  Well, what I think about it is, the globalist, you go from socialism to communism to fascism.
[02:17:31.476 --> 02:17:33.977]  The things are all tied together, developed by the same people.
[02:17:34.357 --> 02:17:36.937]  Look at Russia, it's run by six oligarchs.
[02:17:37.477 --> 02:17:38.618]  So it's going to be the same thing here.
[02:17:39.258 --> 02:17:43.479]  They get you addicted and domesticated, then they take the grain away and slaughter you.
[02:17:43.899 --> 02:17:44.939]  Like a bunch of pigs.
[02:17:46.013 --> 02:17:47.614]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:17:47.754 --> 02:17:51.875]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:17:51.995 --> 02:17:54.896]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:17:54.956 --> 02:18:01.678]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:18:01.858 --> 02:18:04.859]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:18:05.059 --> 02:18:07.460]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:18:07.580 --> 02:18:15.482]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[02:18:16.182 --> 02:18:17.783]  Benzene, Chloride, and Chloroform.
[02:18:17.944 --> 02:18:18.684]  MTBE.
[02:18:18.904 --> 02:18:19.365]  Radon 222.
[02:18:19.825 --> 02:18:21.806]  Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur.
[02:18:21.946 --> 02:18:27.070]  Even nitrates and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[02:18:27.210 --> 02:18:34.475]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of black murky purification elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:18:34.515 --> 02:18:34.896]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:18:34.936 --> 02:18:36.357]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:18:46.377 --> 02:18:47.858]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[02:18:48.058 --> 02:18:55.400]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[02:18:55.701 --> 02:19:00.142]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:19:00.402 --> 02:19:10.226]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[02:19:10.987 --> 02:19:14.651]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[02:19:14.991 --> 02:19:17.474]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[02:19:17.494 --> 02:19:23.721]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[02:19:23.961 --> 02:19:25.503]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[02:19:25.763 --> 02:19:26.664]  Friends, don't wait.
[02:19:26.744 --> 02:19:29.746]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[02:19:29.906 --> 02:19:33.529]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[02:19:33.769 --> 02:19:36.451]  That's 800-255-1912.

[02:19:46.098 --> 02:19:47.599]  Be a part of the new gold rush.
[02:19:48.079 --> 02:19:52.382]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[02:19:52.782 --> 02:19:53.543]  It still is!
[02:19:54.258 --> 02:19:57.761]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[02:19:58.082 --> 02:19:59.883]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[02:20:00.444 --> 02:20:02.526]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[02:20:03.066 --> 02:20:05.068]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[02:20:05.469 --> 02:20:13.136]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[02:20:13.516 --> 02:20:17.260]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.
[02:20:17.964 --> 02:20:22.928]  Call this toll-free number for your free investing in precious metals kit.
[02:20:23.208 --> 02:20:25.249]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[02:21:15.462 --> 02:21:15.742]  U.S.
[02:21:15.782 --> 02:21:16.823]  Gold and Silver Coins.
[02:21:16.923 --> 02:21:18.024]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[02:21:18.184 --> 02:21:18.964]  Which are collectible?
[02:21:19.024 --> 02:21:19.745]  Which are bullion?
[02:21:19.805 --> 02:21:21.926]  Get your answers where the experts get theirs.
[02:21:22.266 --> 02:21:24.408]  The 2005 Red Book Guide to U.S.
[02:21:24.468 --> 02:21:24.848]  Coins.

[02:21:49.804 --> 02:21:50.445]  Welcome back.
[02:21:50.945 --> 02:21:52.746]  You see, we're shifting out of a free market.
[02:21:53.427 --> 02:21:59.431]  Roads are built so people can travel, you can have commerce, the free movement of goods and services.
[02:22:00.412 --> 02:22:05.215]  But in a Soviet or a Nazi or a control freak society, they are taxation control grids.
[02:22:05.835 --> 02:22:07.056]  And now that's happening here.
[02:22:08.297 --> 02:22:11.079]  And it is not privatization that's taking place.
[02:22:11.399 --> 02:22:19.325]  It is the looting and the robbing of the public treasure and the public institutions, and they're going to rape the living daylights out of us financially.
[02:22:20.965 --> 02:22:22.225]  And everything is shifting to that.
[02:22:22.245 --> 02:22:28.587]  I mean, imagine if they've already got the new freedom initiative where they're going to forcibly, psychologically test every child and then every adult.
[02:22:29.527 --> 02:22:32.488]  In 2004, Bush trying to pass that along with the Democrats.
[02:22:32.888 --> 02:22:34.829]  Imagine what life will be like in 10 years.
[02:22:34.909 --> 02:22:38.549]  I mean, right now it's, we need Patriot Act II and a national ID card.
[02:22:39.070 --> 02:22:40.150]  It's never going to end.
[02:22:40.170 --> 02:22:41.370]  They're never going to stop.
[02:22:41.710 --> 02:22:42.831]  I've seen their plans.
[02:22:43.451 --> 02:22:44.371]  A hellish system!
[02:22:45.242 --> 02:22:48.923]  To the FBI agents and police and government bureaucrats, look at your children.
[02:22:49.303 --> 02:22:50.243]  Look at what you're doing.
[02:22:50.303 --> 02:22:52.824]  You'll go, well, we're part of the power structure.
[02:22:52.864 --> 02:22:54.744]  Don't worry, we'll be on top of you.
[02:22:54.764 --> 02:22:56.925]  I know a lot of you have that mindset.
[02:22:56.985 --> 02:22:58.445]  Others just don't believe what I'm saying.
[02:22:58.985 --> 02:23:00.506]  Well, watch what's happening.
[02:23:00.566 --> 02:23:01.626]  Look around you.
[02:23:02.306 --> 02:23:04.406]  Well, some say, I don't have any power then.
[02:23:04.446 --> 02:23:05.147]  What can I do?
[02:23:05.647 --> 02:23:06.647]  You can say no to this.
[02:23:06.667 --> 02:23:07.607]  You can get involved.
[02:23:08.267 --> 02:23:09.328]  You can educate others.
[02:23:09.408 --> 02:23:10.228]  We're the majority.
[02:23:10.288 --> 02:23:11.128]  We have the power.
[02:23:13.064 --> 02:23:25.610]  I wish folks wouldn't have missed that interview in the last hour where they hire public officials who vote for these toll roads and the day after they vote for them they hire their sisters or brothers or children to lucrative $200,000 a year jobs.
[02:23:28.714 --> 02:23:40.160]  The first hour we got into microwave guns to be mounted on the blimps now over our cities and the government messing with antimatter bombs that the scientists admit could trigger an explosion that would kill everybody on the planet.
[02:23:40.180 --> 02:23:42.100]  They don't even know what this antimatter will do.
[02:23:42.441 --> 02:23:43.621]  San Francisco Chronicle.
[02:23:44.161 --> 02:23:46.122]  That's the type of stuff we talk about here, folks.
[02:23:52.384 --> 02:24:04.571]  Michael Causative, to be the number third man, the executive director of the CIA, who's a convicted, uh, admitted shoplifter from CIA headquarters, stealing things, a kleptomaniac!
[02:24:05.872 --> 02:24:13.196]  But he's had his treatment now, so he'll be over all the finances of the CIA, and Porter Goss says, I'm not withdrawing his name, we like him!
[02:24:13.676 --> 02:24:15.597]  It's the type of man we need!
[02:24:16.278 --> 02:24:20.200]  You look at all these other government officials, most of them over these programs are convicted felons!
[02:24:22.598 --> 02:24:22.738]  Ah!
[02:24:24.039 --> 02:24:27.961]  But the crooks tell you we're doing all this to keep you safe from Al Qaeda.
[02:24:28.601 --> 02:24:30.142]  Ed in LA, then Bill and others.
[02:24:30.702 --> 02:24:33.043]  Ed, you were talking about economic theory.
[02:24:33.084 --> 02:24:33.524]  Go ahead.
[02:24:34.144 --> 02:24:43.689]  Well, I was just thinking that there is a way of privatizing the roads where big interests won't control them, absolutely.
[02:24:44.790 --> 02:24:51.273]  Before this government was formed and we were 13 colonies, roads were primarily private at that time.
[02:24:51.906 --> 02:24:52.627]  They were pretty good.
[02:24:53.808 --> 02:24:57.551]  And they were also competitive, and they were very low price.
[02:24:57.751 --> 02:24:58.432]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:24:58.452 --> 02:24:59.953]  Yeah.
[02:25:00.854 --> 02:25:04.897]  You know, I was thinking, Wal-Mart does have a pretty good solution.
[02:25:04.937 --> 02:25:11.843]  They're basically handing over property rights to the roads to the people who have their land bordering the roads themselves.
[02:25:13.025 --> 02:25:16.868]  And then they create consortiums and corporations that then charge.
[02:25:17.858 --> 02:25:20.119]  But that's not how it's going to work.
[02:25:20.259 --> 02:25:32.465]  Private corporations, literally the military industrial complex companies, come by your politicians and then they give the roads to them and then they charge you to use all the existing roads.
[02:25:33.125 --> 02:25:40.569]  I also wanted to ask you if you've ever read Murray Rothbard's book on the history of money and banking in the U.S.?
[02:25:41.569 --> 02:25:45.711]  No, but I've watched the Von Mies Institute video on it.
[02:25:45.731 --> 02:25:47.172]  Yeah, they've got a lot of good stuff there.
[02:25:48.053 --> 02:25:49.005]  I know they do, yes.
[02:25:50.591 --> 02:25:57.177]  Well, I'd just like to suggest that you read that one book, because they talk about a lot of stuff that you talk on.
[02:25:57.797 --> 02:26:05.484]  No, I understand, but what happens is this idea of privatizing roads gets out there into the group mind, and then the government goes, yeah, we're privatizing.
[02:26:05.504 --> 02:26:10.728]  We're going to take every road you've got you've already paid for, and charge you $2,000 a year in your town to use it.
[02:26:10.988 --> 02:26:11.669]  Thanks for the call.
[02:26:12.049 --> 02:26:13.150]  On top of your taxes.
[02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:18.114]  The government upkeeps it, runs it, polices it, and then the private companies just get the money.
[02:26:19.446 --> 02:26:20.507]  And it's existing roads.
[02:26:20.707 --> 02:26:24.631]  They just take one bridge off a road and so you've got to pay to go across the bridge.
[02:26:26.593 --> 02:26:33.779]  It's the old-fashioned toll where the sheriff's corrupt and anybody that wants to travel down the road through the mountains has got to pay him what the toll is.
[02:26:33.819 --> 02:26:34.960]  And the toll is specific.
[02:26:35.340 --> 02:26:39.364]  Let me look around and inspect your... inspect what's in your wagon.
[02:26:40.385 --> 02:26:42.267]  You've got twelve gold pieces.
[02:26:42.387 --> 02:26:43.688]  I'll take all twelve.
[02:26:44.904 --> 02:26:46.425]  That's everything we ever saved.
[02:26:46.445 --> 02:26:48.506]  We're going to Oregon to buy land with that.
[02:26:48.926 --> 02:26:49.886]  You got a problem?
[02:26:51.107 --> 02:26:55.829]  I'm aiming a .40 caliber handgun at you right now, boy.
[02:26:55.869 --> 02:26:58.670]  You better just give me the gold.
[02:27:00.111 --> 02:27:01.692]  I mean, that's all this is.
[02:27:02.732 --> 02:27:03.673]  That's all this is.
[02:27:04.373 --> 02:27:05.994]  Just the Mafia shaking you down.
[02:27:06.534 --> 02:27:10.676]  Putting a black ski mask on and going, we cover our identities to keep you safe.
[02:27:11.502 --> 02:27:15.966]  We're putting barbed wire up around government buildings and cameras everywhere, but don't aim cameras at us!
[02:27:18.008 --> 02:27:19.289]  We love you!
[02:27:19.650 --> 02:27:21.251]  Terrorists are about to strike any minute!
[02:27:21.431 --> 02:27:22.332]  Give us all your freedoms!
[02:27:22.692 --> 02:27:23.953]  Terrorists are about to strike any minute!
[02:27:24.154 --> 02:27:24.954]  Give us all your freedoms!
[02:27:25.355 --> 02:27:26.636]  We're wide open to terror attack!
[02:27:26.956 --> 02:27:31.621]  Yeah, because you left the border wide open and fund all the terrorists, you pack of bloodthirsty Nazis!
[02:27:32.241 --> 02:27:34.123]  We'll be right back with a bunch of news, stay with me.
[02:27:36.005 --> 02:27:39.015]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.938 --> 02:27:42.606]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.709 --> 02:27:48.770]  You and your family members gaining enough minerals in the daily diet?
[02:27:49.130 --> 02:27:51.631]  It's not likely according to the World Health Organization.
[02:27:51.872 --> 02:27:58.934]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[02:27:59.134 --> 02:28:02.416]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[02:28:02.676 --> 02:28:04.697]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[02:28:05.037 --> 02:28:12.860]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:14.401]  Either way, why chance it?
[02:28:14.501 --> 02:28:24.468]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call to Sea Minerals at 877-835-5555 and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost to the immune system.
[02:28:24.708 --> 02:28:28.871]  Sea Minerals provides a complete and balanced set of minerals and trace elements found in our oceans.
[02:28:29.111 --> 02:28:33.834]  Reclaim that youthful, energetic feeling and restore your good health with the help of minerals from the sea.
[02:28:33.974 --> 02:28:35.835]  Call Sea Minerals today, toll-free, 877-835-5555.
[02:28:35.855 --> 02:28:36.055]  That's 877-835-5555.
[02:28:45.361 --> 02:28:49.242]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:28:49.462 --> 02:28:54.903]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:28:55.184 --> 02:29:05.547]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:29:05.707 --> 02:29:10.048]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:29:10.168 --> 02:29:11.049]  We're good to go!
[02:29:25.162 --> 02:29:25.683]  We're good to go.
[02:29:45.413 --> 02:29:48.677]  Ever walk into someone's house and you can tell instantly they own pets?
[02:29:49.017 --> 02:29:53.702]  They've made the mistake of using a pet odor and stain product that only covers the problem temporarily.
[02:29:53.882 --> 02:29:55.404]  We don't have that problem in our home.
[02:29:55.604 --> 02:29:58.026]  We've discovered it's just better to use PAWS.
[02:29:58.247 --> 02:30:04.974]  Pet Accident Wash-Up Solution, or PAWS, is the quickest and safest pet stain and odor eliminator known to man, or man's best friend.
[02:30:05.254 --> 02:30:08.495]  PAWS is safe on any material, even directly on your pet's bedding.
[02:30:08.715 --> 02:30:11.156]  PAWS will work on the toughest stains and odors in your home.
[02:30:11.476 --> 02:30:14.157]  It's guaranteed to lift stains that have been set in for years.
[02:30:14.377 --> 02:30:16.557]  Proving again, it's just better to use PAWS.
[02:30:16.917 --> 02:30:20.218]  It's only a matter of time until Fido or Fluffy has an accident.
[02:30:20.458 --> 02:30:21.619]  Be prepared with PAWS.
[02:30:21.939 --> 02:30:25.920]  Use PAWS anywhere stains and odors are a problem, like the laundry or the bathroom.
[02:30:26.120 --> 02:30:29.601]  Try PAWS once and you'll quickly discover it's just better to use PAWS.
[02:30:29.901 --> 02:30:34.662]  Call 1-877-289-PAWS, or visit GetPAWS.com.
[02:30:34.862 --> 02:30:38.823]  That's www.getpaws.com.
[02:30:38.983 --> 02:30:41.724]  PAWS comes with a 110% money-back guarantee.
[02:30:42.004 --> 02:30:48.425]  Use nothing to lose, but stay in some owners.
[02:30:48.485 --> 02:30:54.506]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:54.906 --> 02:30:58.047]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:00.473 --> 02:31:06.617]  The major electronic voting machine companies are publicly run by the Central Intelligence Agency.
[02:31:07.278 --> 02:31:09.539]  Their own engineers have quit and said this.
[02:31:09.880 --> 02:31:10.640]  It's been public.
[02:31:10.660 --> 02:31:12.161]  They've got felons working for them.
[02:31:12.401 --> 02:31:14.403]  They've been caught stealing elections coast to coast.
[02:31:14.783 --> 02:31:20.507]  And then magically, once these machines go in, they say, we don't care if 90 plus percent of you are against toll roads.
[02:31:20.947 --> 02:31:26.071]  We don't care if 90 plus percent of you are against having your children forcibly psychologically tested and now you adults.
[02:31:27.364 --> 02:31:30.509]  We don't care if you don't want cameras in your local school bathrooms.
[02:31:31.130 --> 02:31:34.474]  We don't care if you don't want us to build a giant prison by your house.
[02:31:35.055 --> 02:31:36.958]  Because you can just vote us out!
[02:31:37.018 --> 02:31:38.801]  Go ahead and try!
[02:31:40.643 --> 02:31:42.366]  See, in the past they were responsive.
[02:31:43.149 --> 02:31:46.050]  To 90 plus percent of people being against all this.
[02:31:46.690 --> 02:31:50.052]  87 percent being against the open borders and all the illegal aliens pouring in.
[02:31:50.472 --> 02:31:54.073]  But now the government just goes, no, what you gonna do?
[02:31:56.174 --> 02:32:04.017]  We've got giant battalions of militarized police with microwave weapons and sound cannons and huge facilities to hold you.
[02:32:05.308 --> 02:32:07.069]  Wait till we take your pension funds.
[02:32:07.109 --> 02:32:09.409]  You think the giant toll roads are going to be bad?
[02:32:09.429 --> 02:32:12.390]  Just wait till you try to riot and protest.
[02:32:12.750 --> 02:32:14.451]  Wait till we take your guns.
[02:32:14.951 --> 02:32:16.932]  We've got nice things planned for you.
[02:32:19.253 --> 02:32:21.813]  Meanwhile, oil hits $51 a barrel.
[02:32:22.013 --> 02:32:23.134]  All completely staged.
[02:32:23.214 --> 02:32:26.415]  It's admitted they found giant record oil supplies everywhere.
[02:32:26.435 --> 02:32:30.716]  The oil companies have the record profits, but it doesn't seem to matter.
[02:32:30.756 --> 02:32:31.757]  There's no oil left.
[02:32:31.797 --> 02:32:32.897]  That's why this is happening.
[02:32:34.566 --> 02:32:36.608]  Oh my goodness, such a scam.
[02:32:37.549 --> 02:32:38.970]  See, that's the problem with corruption.
[02:32:39.050 --> 02:32:40.392]  It just gets worse and worse and worse.
[02:32:40.432 --> 02:32:41.753]  They get away with more and more and more.
[02:32:42.093 --> 02:32:43.555]  And finally, they just get sloppy.
[02:32:45.917 --> 02:32:47.118]  You wanted to be slaves?
[02:32:47.138 --> 02:32:49.780]  You're going to get front row seats for being slaves, my friends.
[02:32:50.821 --> 02:32:56.426]  The good news is, though, I've never seen the blinders coming off people's eyes and minds so fast as it is now.
[02:32:56.967 --> 02:32:58.168]  I'll take a few more calls.
[02:32:58.188 --> 02:32:58.728]  We're going to go to
[02:33:00.524 --> 02:33:05.345]  Jeffrey and Fred and Russell and a few others, but I've got a few other news stories I want to add here.
[02:33:05.765 --> 02:33:11.186]  Over the next three or four minutes, we are honored to have Debbie Morrow up with us from New Millennium Concepts.
[02:33:12.027 --> 02:33:22.109]  And Debbie, I don't agree with you and your Made in America products, the best known gravity purification system known, major university studies.
[02:33:22.689 --> 02:33:27.450]  I think that we should trust the government and drink the herbicides, the pesticides, the mercury,
[02:33:28.531 --> 02:33:49.085]  The lead, the arsenic, I think that we should drink with pleasure all the Prozac and Ritalin that's in most water supplies and all the dead bacteria and the chlorine and I don't think it's a good thing to have a system that can purify and get us good water in this technological society where they admit terrorists will probably strike any minute.
[02:33:50.506 --> 02:33:56.751]  I think it's a good idea to just continue drinking the water and trusting my government that on the news now says mercury is nutritious.
[02:33:58.274 --> 02:34:01.716]  Well, Alex, I have to disagree with you.
[02:34:02.176 --> 02:34:04.677]  That's very evil, but go ahead.
[02:34:05.218 --> 02:34:13.002]  I know, I mean, I just really think that if we could prepare our bodies to at least be as healthy as possible in any way we can.
[02:34:13.706 --> 02:34:17.430]  You know, we ought to do it and that's one way to do it is with the perky water.
[02:34:17.691 --> 02:34:28.423]  Well, I think it's better that most of the listeners are going to procrastinate, aren't going to call, aren't going to get your filter, aren't going to buy some $10, $20 charcoal filter that just cuts out bad taste but none of the bad stuff.
[02:34:29.436 --> 02:34:32.958]  I don't think people should call you and purchase this Made in America product that I use.
[02:34:33.238 --> 02:34:34.619]  Well, you know, that'd be okay.
[02:34:34.639 --> 02:34:35.980]  I could take a vacation then.
[02:34:36.100 --> 02:34:37.120]  I don't know, you know.
[02:34:37.160 --> 02:34:38.141]  No, I mean, I'm being sarcastic.
[02:34:38.181 --> 02:34:39.682]  I need people to call back.
[02:34:39.722 --> 02:34:41.803]  I know so many people that are awake to the news.
[02:34:41.903 --> 02:34:44.964]  They're great people, but they still drink tap water, Debbie.
[02:34:45.445 --> 02:34:46.565]  Yes, they do.
[02:34:46.925 --> 02:34:48.126]  People in my own family.
[02:34:48.646 --> 02:34:51.848]  You know, there's so many people out there who just do not realize
[02:34:52.501 --> 02:34:54.383]  How important it is.
[02:34:54.503 --> 02:34:56.284]  Well this is 70% of our body.
[02:34:56.344 --> 02:35:00.088]  We can take control of 70% of what we put in our body.
[02:35:00.768 --> 02:35:14.960]  We can take control here of a large portion of our life if people will just call and get the filters and it's also made here in America and you guys pay the shortwave bill for our international outreach to reach millions of people globally.
[02:35:15.901 --> 02:35:18.884]  And I will call everybody back and they get to talk to me.
[02:35:19.665 --> 02:35:24.230]  And we get to have a great time taking their order for their Berkey water filter.
[02:35:24.470 --> 02:35:26.852]  That's a fringe benefit, is it not?
[02:35:26.872 --> 02:35:28.234]  That is the fringe benefit.
[02:35:28.394 --> 02:35:33.900]  How healthy, how much better they're going to feel drinking the water that comes out of their Berkey water filter.
[02:35:34.320 --> 02:35:35.681]  And the money saving.
[02:35:36.803 --> 02:35:41.968]  For the people who are out there buying bottled water and lugging it from the store and all that.
[02:35:42.438 --> 02:35:47.121]  They don't have to do that anymore with the Berkey Water Filter, and we do stand behind our product 100%.
[02:35:48.382 --> 02:35:50.523]  And by the way, bottled water is not trustworthy.
[02:35:52.044 --> 02:35:59.990]  We've got masses of reports on that, so it's important to purify your own water, get your own little sport bottle, fill it up, carry it around with you.
[02:36:00.370 --> 02:36:12.278]  Debbie, you've got a couple different specials, $199 for the Berkey Light System without the LED lights, $199 with one free gift, a sport bottle, or that could be a Sheltering in Place DVD, which is excellent.
[02:36:13.863 --> 02:36:19.469]  Or, of course, the Prudent Places CD with maps and demographics of the country and safe areas.
[02:36:20.370 --> 02:36:21.732]  People need to give you a call.
[02:36:21.812 --> 02:36:22.473]  It's 1-888-803-4438.
[02:36:23.454 --> 02:36:29.662]  If you call, and it's an answering machine, leave your name and number, Debbie will call you right back.
[02:36:29.682 --> 02:36:29.742]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:36:31.984 --> 02:36:33.265]  Ask me about the water security package too.
[02:36:33.305 --> 02:36:34.586]  It's a $581 value for only $429.
[02:36:59.947 --> 02:37:01.468]  And what do you get with that?
[02:37:01.548 --> 02:37:03.488]  You get the Berkey light with the lights.
[02:37:04.228 --> 02:37:05.989]  You get an extra set of filters.
[02:37:06.549 --> 02:37:10.610]  You get the solar attachment, the auxiliary battery attachment.
[02:37:11.191 --> 02:37:13.191]  Prudent places on CD-ROM.
[02:37:13.711 --> 02:37:16.832]  Sheltering in place either on DVD or VHS.
[02:37:17.773 --> 02:37:18.733]  Two sport bottles.
[02:37:19.413 --> 02:37:20.233]  Did I already say that?
[02:37:20.914 --> 02:37:22.934]  No, I don't think so.
[02:37:22.974 --> 02:37:28.136]  It's a $581 value for $429 and we'd really like to get those out to people.
[02:37:29.113 --> 02:37:35.037]  We've had lots of requests, especially for the solar panels, you know, with everything going on.
[02:37:35.257 --> 02:37:38.019]  Now, again, there's no moving parts in the filter itself.
[02:37:38.099 --> 02:37:41.401]  It has built-in LEDs that burn continually for 14 years.
[02:37:41.421 --> 02:37:42.581]  It has rechargeable batteries.
[02:37:42.942 --> 02:37:45.703]  And if you get the solar panel with it, it charges those.
[02:37:46.044 --> 02:37:47.144]  Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[02:37:47.324 --> 02:37:48.725]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:37:48.925 --> 02:37:49.266]  You bet.
[02:37:49.286 --> 02:37:50.406]  Always good hearing from you.
[02:37:51.267 --> 02:37:54.949]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeffrey in Missouri.
[02:37:55.409 --> 02:37:56.370]  You're on the air, Jeffrey.
[02:37:57.037 --> 02:37:58.038]  Mr. Jones, Alex.
[02:37:58.318 --> 02:37:58.658]  Welcome.
[02:37:59.059 --> 02:37:59.359]  Thank you.
[02:37:59.399 --> 02:38:03.002]  I bought 10 of your Road to Terrority 9-11 and I distributed them.
[02:38:03.943 --> 02:38:05.024]  You're awesome, thank you.
[02:38:05.364 --> 02:38:12.490]  And I gave to the local library and I'm trying to monitor them to see if they're going out or not, but I can't find them on the shelf, so I gotta look more into that.
[02:38:13.371 --> 02:38:19.376]  So the reason why I called was I saw Gary Hart, former Senator Gary Hart on a Fox News channel in Chicago.
[02:38:19.436 --> 02:38:21.277]  Was he terrorizing us as usual?
[02:38:21.377 --> 02:38:21.958]  Yes, he did.
[02:38:22.298 --> 02:38:22.638]  He said,
[02:38:23.823 --> 02:38:29.784]  Denver and Dallas is going to be hit by bio-terrorism and the newscaster goes, how do you know that?
[02:38:30.984 --> 02:38:35.265]  And he goes, well, you got to think like a terrorist and then you can figure it out.
[02:38:35.465 --> 02:38:38.266]  So, you know, that kind of horrified me.
[02:38:38.586 --> 02:38:44.207]  Well, we've got a clip in my film Road to Tyranny where he says we need to use this disaster to get a new world order.
[02:38:44.967 --> 02:38:48.128]  And I knew that the globalists were going to carry out 9-11
[02:38:49.665 --> 02:38:54.722]  When about two months before 9-11, Hart and Rudman, the two CFR chairmen of the Terror Committee,
[02:38:55.279 --> 02:38:56.300]  That's what it's called.
[02:38:57.081 --> 02:38:59.323]  They went on Hardball and they started laughing.
[02:38:59.363 --> 02:39:00.444]  It was a celebration.
[02:39:00.924 --> 02:39:06.409]  And he goes, big buildings, New York, boom, coming down, oh, Al-Qaeda gonna hit, haha, life's gonna change!
[02:39:06.969 --> 02:39:08.531]  And I saw all this other indicators.
[02:39:08.831 --> 02:39:10.352]  And yeah, a couple years ago he said that again.
[02:39:10.372 --> 02:39:12.574]  Denver, Dallas, Cleveland will be destroyed.
[02:39:13.115 --> 02:39:16.077]  Dirty bombs, nukes, bio-weapons, it's gonna happen.
[02:39:16.478 --> 02:39:18.099]  We're gonna take all your rights away.
[02:39:18.359 --> 02:39:19.340]  Oh, it's so good.
[02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:20.521]  I got one more thing, Alex.
[02:39:21.713 --> 02:39:24.635]  Nobody's talking about it, and I think you might have missed it, I'm not sure.
[02:39:24.655 --> 02:39:25.695]  Let me stop you first.
[02:39:26.255 --> 02:39:29.017]  This newest thing, where was Hart on television saying this?
[02:39:29.297 --> 02:39:31.518]  It was on Fox local channel in Chicago.
[02:39:31.538 --> 02:39:34.580]  Yeah, the national Fox knows to not ask him how he knows that.
[02:39:35.220 --> 02:39:35.460]  Right.
[02:39:36.541 --> 02:39:37.982]  How do you know the specific targets?
[02:39:38.002 --> 02:39:39.422]  We don't have any specifics, Gary.
[02:39:40.203 --> 02:39:42.044]  And the guy will say, it will happen.
[02:39:42.144 --> 02:39:43.204]  It's going to happen.
[02:39:43.425 --> 02:39:45.346]  And then after it happens, he goes, I'm so smart.
[02:39:45.626 --> 02:39:47.747]  The police don't run and arrest him for questioning.
[02:39:48.977 --> 02:39:49.417]  Go ahead.
[02:39:49.637 --> 02:39:50.497]  He should be tortured.
[02:39:51.158 --> 02:39:51.738]  No, he shouldn't.
[02:39:51.918 --> 02:39:52.358]  I know that.
[02:39:52.398 --> 02:39:53.258]  Nobody should be tortured.
[02:39:53.298 --> 02:39:53.998]  I understand that.
[02:39:54.018 --> 02:39:55.519]  Go ahead and say what you were going to say.
[02:39:55.559 --> 02:39:59.520]  The other one was the House Chaplain committed suicide August 31st, year 2001.
[02:39:59.560 --> 02:40:03.301]  For Congress.
[02:40:04.321 --> 02:40:05.541]  It was a short blip in the paper.
[02:40:05.561 --> 02:40:06.441]  I remember that, yeah.
[02:40:06.582 --> 02:40:08.822]  And the family asked that it not be investigated.
[02:40:10.202 --> 02:40:11.763]  But it's so coincidental to 9-1-1.
[02:40:14.978 --> 02:40:15.778]  Very interesting.
[02:40:15.838 --> 02:40:16.538]  I remember that.
[02:40:16.558 --> 02:40:17.198]  Thanks for the call.
[02:40:17.218 --> 02:40:18.239]  Thank you.
[02:40:18.279 --> 02:40:19.899]  Let's talk to Fred in Pennsylvania.
[02:40:19.939 --> 02:40:20.639]  Fred, go ahead.
[02:40:20.659 --> 02:40:23.160]  Hi.
[02:40:23.380 --> 02:40:24.400]  Hello.
[02:40:25.040 --> 02:40:30.561]  I wanted to bring up a parallel between the 1912, excuse me, the 1916 election and also the 1964 election and this one.
[02:40:30.681 --> 02:40:32.501]  And I saw a biography of Wilson
[02:40:43.071 --> 02:40:45.533]  Uh, and his effort on his re-election.
[02:40:46.054 --> 02:40:48.215]  And it seems like Bush is doing the same thing.
[02:40:48.235 --> 02:41:02.947]  He's just trying to coast in, uh, trying to, you know, wrap himself in the flag, coast in, and, um, you know, kind of tell half-truths about, or worse, about the events.
[02:41:03.007 --> 02:41:12.474]  And also, 64, when you had a cataclysmic event, and then you had the parade of lies about what their intentions were.
[02:41:13.174 --> 02:41:16.675]  But Johnson's intentions were leading up to the election of 64.
[02:41:17.435 --> 02:41:17.955]  What do you think?
[02:41:20.036 --> 02:41:23.476]  Well, I mean, look, this election is totally staged, just like those others.
[02:41:24.457 --> 02:41:30.138]  And Woodrow Wilson, of course, the League of Nations architect, and before he died, he said, oh, I was wrong, I was part of an evil takeover.
[02:41:30.818 --> 02:41:32.078]  And these are public statements.
[02:41:33.199 --> 02:41:37.240]  So Bush, Kerry, no matter who wins, we lose.
[02:41:37.880 --> 02:41:39.000]  It's the same system.
[02:41:39.040 --> 02:41:39.580]  Thanks, Fred.
[02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:41.041]  Russell in Florida.
[02:41:41.081 --> 02:41:42.581]  Go ahead, Russell, you're on the air.
[02:41:44.056 --> 02:41:44.876]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:41:44.917 --> 02:41:46.277]  It's been a few weeks.
[02:41:46.617 --> 02:41:48.939]  We've got hit by some pretty hefty hurricanes.
[02:41:48.959 --> 02:41:51.160]  That's right, four hurricanes!
[02:41:51.560 --> 02:41:59.565]  Unbelievable, and I went through some withdrawals because I wasn't able to listen to you for about two or three weeks, but I'm glad to be able to call you again.
[02:41:59.585 --> 02:42:02.026]  A couple of things here.
[02:42:02.046 --> 02:42:05.969]  Just a comment on how you said the Elite gets sloppy and cocky.
[02:42:06.829 --> 02:42:11.692]  That Scalia quote that he made saying that orgies were good and
[02:42:12.438 --> 02:42:19.022]  You know, here you have a so-called Christian conservative, or a fundamental conservative, making statements like this.
[02:42:19.062 --> 02:42:20.583]  I'd like you to make a comment on that.
[02:42:20.863 --> 02:42:36.352]  Yes, Scalia told one of the big, what was it, the Harvard newspaper, about how good big orgies are, and then meanwhile he's the same guy out on these hunting trips, these secret hunting trips, under high security with Dick Cheney, and it's been reported what Dick Cheney likes to do on hunting trips.
[02:42:36.732 --> 02:42:37.673]  We'll just leave it at that.
[02:42:40.600 --> 02:42:40.940]  Pardon me?
[02:42:41.080 --> 02:42:42.460]  Quack quack, he says, right?
[02:42:43.261 --> 02:42:47.781]  Remember he made that comment, he says quack quack when they ask him a question about that on a duck hunting trip?
[02:42:48.662 --> 02:42:48.982]  Yeah.
[02:42:49.042 --> 02:42:50.202]  They're throwing it in our faces.
[02:42:51.202 --> 02:42:56.303]  Well, they really are throwing it in our faces, but what they like to do, what their taste is.
[02:42:57.323 --> 02:43:10.286]  I mean, you got New York Post, Bohemian Grove shipping in the male porn stars to quote headlines, service the elite, and all these mainstream news articles about it, and then Arnold posing for the magazines, and then he's out there at the Grove.
[02:43:11.019 --> 02:43:15.142]  I mean, it's just the same story over and over again, and this is the new Christian conservatism.
[02:43:15.602 --> 02:43:19.084]  If you're not devil worshipping and you're not involved in orgies, you're not Christian.
[02:43:19.625 --> 02:43:22.267]  And if you're devil worshipping, you're a good Christian, we should all trust.
[02:43:22.627 --> 02:43:24.588]  Yeah, you brought up a great point there.
[02:43:24.668 --> 02:43:28.791]  If it wasn't for the Christian conservatives and the pulpits not doing their job,
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:30.801]  Stuff wouldn't be happening right now.
[02:43:30.821 --> 02:43:31.901]  Well, that's right.
[02:43:31.921 --> 02:43:40.885]  I mean, we know what the liberals are up to and what they're about, but they've co-opted the conservative movement in this country to where people praise Arnold Schwarzenegger, who's more liberal than Bill Clinton.
[02:43:41.165 --> 02:43:41.665]  Absolutely.
[02:43:41.865 --> 02:43:43.186]  They've turned everything upside down.
[02:43:43.206 --> 02:43:46.767]  I think they even said that in the Bible, that what's up will be down, what's down will be up.
[02:43:46.847 --> 02:43:48.107]  Something in those terms.
[02:43:49.328 --> 02:43:50.829]  I'd like you to make one comment, though.
[02:43:51.689 --> 02:43:59.152]  I'm getting ready to take a flight here in the next few weeks, and I'm a little nervous because of potential terrorist attacks, and I just wanted to
[02:43:59.625 --> 02:44:07.391]  No, if you had any comments or you saw anything on the horizon happening, you know, an October surprise, or... Do you see anything out there in intelligence?
[02:44:07.411 --> 02:44:10.414]  Well, I mean, you know, the White House told U.S.
[02:44:10.454 --> 02:44:24.305]  News and World Report four months ago that there will be massive terror attacks, the Capitol will be attacked, there will be coast-to-coast attacks, and then now they've said, well, there'll probably be attacks, and
[02:44:25.473 --> 02:44:27.234]  They stand to gain from it regardless.
[02:44:27.594 --> 02:44:29.855]  Terry is for all the same police state provisions.
[02:44:31.716 --> 02:44:32.937]  You know, if he gets elected.
[02:44:33.237 --> 02:44:37.479]  So I don't know if they're going to pull a tax, but you just heard what Gary Hart's up to.
[02:44:37.539 --> 02:44:42.421]  You just heard what, you know, I just covered what they've been saying and doing.
[02:44:43.002 --> 02:44:43.962]  And so I don't know.
[02:44:44.042 --> 02:44:45.423]  I don't know if they're going to pull an attack.
[02:44:45.763 --> 02:44:47.504]  Will we have more tax, period?
[02:44:48.344 --> 02:44:51.186]  In the next few years or even shorter?
[02:44:51.386 --> 02:44:52.006]  Absolutely.
[02:44:52.346 --> 02:44:53.667]  This is how they get their control.
[02:44:54.087 --> 02:45:04.713]  Until we point out who was behind the terrorism, until we point out who has the motive, until we expose that to enough people, they're going to continue to pull terror attacks because they get power out of it.
[02:45:04.733 --> 02:45:05.293]  Thanks for the call.
[02:45:05.333 --> 02:45:05.533]  Right.
[02:45:07.054 --> 02:45:07.875]  I appreciate your call.
[02:45:09.995 --> 02:45:11.136]  I mean, it's really that simple.
[02:45:11.196 --> 02:45:12.617]  How are they going to invade Iran?
[02:45:12.657 --> 02:45:13.898]  How are they going to invade Syria?
[02:45:14.178 --> 02:45:15.879]  How are they going to give us a new national draft?
[02:45:16.220 --> 02:45:20.803]  How are they going to distract us away from not fighting against the new Freedom Initiative?
[02:45:21.384 --> 02:45:22.765]  Or all of this?
[02:45:23.045 --> 02:45:24.406]  And the answer is terrorism.
[02:45:24.826 --> 02:45:26.687]  How are they going to distract us from $51 a barrel fuel?
[02:45:26.807 --> 02:45:30.070]  Oil prices now up 78% from a year ago.
[02:45:30.230 --> 02:45:31.071]  It was 76% last week.
[02:45:31.091 --> 02:45:32.492]  Now it's up 78% from a year ago.
[02:45:39.865 --> 02:45:49.314]  I mean, it's just going to go up and up and up, everything, raping and pillaging us financially, dumbing us down, taking our freedoms, getting rid of the Bill of Rights, national ID cards.
[02:45:50.455 --> 02:45:52.176]  This is the new Orwellian Palace.
[02:45:53.117 --> 02:45:59.403]  And consolidating the media, shutting down AXS TV, getting ready to shut down the web, talking about it with internet too.
[02:45:59.423 --> 02:46:00.904]  I mean, it's all coming into focus.
[02:46:01.444 --> 02:46:05.088]  Meanwhile, they admit they're extraditing American citizens to foreign countries for torture.
[02:46:05.428 --> 02:46:06.569]  That's the Washington Times.
[02:46:07.541 --> 02:46:11.002]  Meanwhile, they're mounting, you know, microwave guns on the surveillance blunts.
[02:46:12.142 --> 02:46:13.882]  Meanwhile, they're just admitting all of it.
[02:46:13.942 --> 02:46:17.063]  It's just all coming right out in the open.
[02:46:18.863 --> 02:46:23.725]  And it's a sad thing, but this is the nature of tyranny.
[02:46:24.185 --> 02:46:30.366]  Our soldiers are being killed and being maimed and wounded over there in a war that's a complete fraud.
[02:46:31.377 --> 02:46:32.938]  And we're not bringing freedom to that country.
[02:46:32.978 --> 02:46:39.821]  Now they're saying they're going to break off part of the country that just so happens to have 80% of the oil and make that its own new little Kuwait over there.
[02:46:40.201 --> 02:46:41.082]  I mean, that's the plan.
[02:46:42.723 --> 02:46:49.146]  And it's just going to get worse and worse and worse and worse as the globalists arm all our enemies to escalate this global crisis.
[02:46:51.367 --> 02:46:55.449]  Meanwhile, we have got just escalating tyranny everywhere.
[02:46:57.071 --> 02:46:59.673]  But the average American still isn't aware of the details.
[02:46:59.693 --> 02:47:03.396]  They know something's wrong, but they feel powerless.
[02:47:03.436 --> 02:47:05.918]  They feel like they can't affect change.
[02:47:05.958 --> 02:47:11.002]  They don't realize how much power they have and how they can inform other people.
[02:47:12.483 --> 02:47:19.509]  But as things get worse and worse, you are going to see the resistance rise and crystallize against the tyranny.
[02:47:20.390 --> 02:47:24.693]  And the most important group we've got to deprogram are people inside the system who are serving the system.
[02:47:25.126 --> 02:47:28.028]  I mean, they can't honestly look at the facts and deny what we're saying.
[02:47:29.610 --> 02:47:51.108]  We've got a Pentagon telling us that Communist China and Russia are our allies and we're going to merge NATO with these countries and go after, quote, the real threat, the gap, are these third world countries that are just pushover enemies that can be taken over and have their natural resources extracted while eugenics programs are carried out against them.
[02:47:55.871 --> 02:47:57.932]  No, that's the reality here.
[02:48:00.774 --> 02:48:03.255]  So I hope that everybody realizes that.
[02:48:04.216 --> 02:48:10.139]  More than 90 million people visiting Britain each year to have their faces electronically scanned in a massive security upgrade.
[02:48:10.874 --> 02:48:12.255]  This is the news of the world.
[02:48:12.275 --> 02:48:17.439]  What they don't mention here is that the Britons all have to do this to get their driver's license or ID card.
[02:48:17.479 --> 02:48:21.602]  Just like we hear foreigners have to do that to come here, but we have to do it too to get the driver's license.
[02:48:22.103 --> 02:48:24.064]  And then people from Latin America are given the waiver.
[02:48:24.545 --> 02:48:26.606]  That's a news article here out of News of the World.
[02:48:27.667 --> 02:48:30.529]  We'll cover a few final news stories on the other side of this quick break.
[02:48:31.310 --> 02:48:32.551]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:48:33.266 --> 02:48:37.228]  And again, Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are the big websites.
[02:48:37.749 --> 02:48:41.511]  We also have PrisonPlanet.tv, so check them all out today.
[02:48:42.071 --> 02:48:42.872]  We'll be right back!
[02:48:45.965 --> 02:48:52.789]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:53.109 --> 02:48:54.470]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:54.670 --> 02:48:56.891]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:57.031 --> 02:48:59.132]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:59.412 --> 02:49:04.335]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:04.675 --> 02:49:08.697]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:08.957 --> 02:49:10.738]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:10.798 --> 02:49:21.441]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.601 --> 02:49:23.501]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:49:23.701 --> 02:49:25.742]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today.
[02:49:25.742 --> 02:49:26.082]  We're good.
[02:49:45.467 --> 02:49:47.088]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:49:47.208 --> 02:49:51.309]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:49:51.469 --> 02:49:54.350]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:49:54.410 --> 02:50:01.132]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:50:01.312 --> 02:50:04.313]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:50:04.533 --> 02:50:06.914]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:50:07.034 --> 02:50:14.936]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[02:50:15.196 --> 02:50:26.520]  Hydrazine, benzene, chloride and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[02:50:26.680 --> 02:50:33.843]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of blank Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:33.863 --> 02:50:34.343]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:50:34.383 --> 02:50:35.804]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:50:46.305 --> 02:50:46.826]  Thank you.
[02:51:01.667 --> 02:51:02.328]  We're good to go!
[02:51:31.209 --> 02:51:34.292]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:34.452 --> 02:51:40.418]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:50.588 --> 02:51:52.510]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:51:52.970 --> 02:51:55.713]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:57.661 --> 02:52:13.532]  Our troops from the first Gulf War's children have three times more common birth defects, deformities, and there's new big articles out about depleted uranium being linked directly to even increased levels over the tripling in deformities of children.
[02:52:13.552 --> 02:52:20.116]  That's how you support the troops, let them breathe deadly poison that our own government sprayed everywhere, a total weapon of mass destruction.
[02:52:20.916 --> 02:52:24.198]  Also, a mock terror attack to test a coma response.
[02:52:24.819 --> 02:52:34.825]  Washington, EPI, the military and law enforcement agencies, Long Puget Sound, and Tacoma, Washington announced plans to conduct a mock massive terror attack today and tomorrow.
[02:52:35.706 --> 02:52:38.347]  And it gets into all the drills and the takeover drill.
[02:52:38.708 --> 02:52:46.753]  Another article here, I learned of this about six years ago, and now here it is, just mainstream news.
[02:52:47.885 --> 02:52:54.247]  On Tuesday, September 28th, a new federally funded FEMA-directed citizen training program began in my town called CERT.
[02:52:54.267 --> 02:52:56.568]  It stands for Community Emergency Response Team.
[02:52:56.588 --> 02:53:00.869]  A quick internet search reveals that my own town isn't the only one participating.
[02:53:00.909 --> 02:53:04.490]  Nearly every town in America has its own CERT program, it would appear.
[02:53:05.111 --> 02:53:14.234]  Yeah, they have this called SecureCore, too, where your kids train for gun confiscation and checkpoint operation, and then to graduate from high school, you'll have to serve time every week doing this.
[02:53:14.514 --> 02:53:15.034]  And here it is!
[02:53:15.374 --> 02:53:20.856]  My neighbor's teenage son attended CERT initial operating meeting and later showed me the equipment and the materials he was given.
[02:53:20.876 --> 02:53:28.418]  He was given high-powered flashlights, headgear, hardhat, goggles to help run checkpoint traffic control.
[02:53:29.098 --> 02:53:34.700]  In the near future, he said, he'll also be given, free of charge, a special radio to get orders from.
[02:53:35.549 --> 02:53:40.492]  Then he showed me his 300 page CERT training manual, along with training schedule for upcoming weeks.
[02:53:40.512 --> 02:53:42.553]  The CERT training operation is intensive.
[02:53:42.953 --> 02:53:44.974]  It's scheduled to last for only a little over a month.
[02:53:45.595 --> 02:53:48.638]  In short of just 35 days, CERT trainees will learn the following.
[02:53:49.018 --> 02:53:55.723]  Disaster Preparedness, Disaster Fire Safety, Disaster Medical Operations, Light Search and Rescue, CERT Organization, Disaster Psychology.
[02:53:56.084 --> 02:53:57.545]  And again, they just get you into this.
[02:53:57.965 --> 02:54:07.693]  Other programs we've seen in West Virginia is giving 12-year-olds M16s and training them that when they're 16 they can join the Corps of Troops and help defend the local government.
[02:54:08.214 --> 02:54:11.616]  And then the terror training is from homeschoolers and Christians.
[02:54:12.217 --> 02:54:13.338]  Mainstream News, folks.
[02:54:14.978 --> 02:54:18.479]  Training the children with their M16s to fight the evil homeschooling parents.
[02:54:18.779 --> 02:54:21.680]  The evil terrorists who aren't for the microchips are everywhere.
[02:54:23.401 --> 02:54:25.002]  I'm sorry to all the callers that are holding.
[02:54:25.022 --> 02:54:26.562]  I don't think I'm going to be able to go to your calls.
[02:54:26.802 --> 02:54:30.384]  I've got another article here we mentioned yesterday and again I should spend time on this.
[02:54:30.524 --> 02:54:33.545]  Kansas to conduct flu exercises in October.
[02:54:33.605 --> 02:54:36.626]  Mass force inoculation drills from their own website.
[02:54:39.304 --> 02:54:42.125]  All of it martial law, folks, and all the drills.
[02:54:42.365 --> 02:54:44.786]  Evil right-wingers, evil Christians have to be arrested.
[02:54:46.427 --> 02:54:52.890]  And they're simulating these everywhere, while the so-called conservative talk show hosts say, it's for the Muslims, the evil Muslims, it's for them.
[02:54:53.370 --> 02:54:55.851]  Well, I got news for you, it's not, boys and girls.
[02:54:56.471 --> 02:55:01.033]  They're getting you all trained in on it, in this tribal psychology that, oh, it's just for the Arabs.
[02:55:01.193 --> 02:55:01.833]  And it's not!
[02:55:02.614 --> 02:55:04.634]  And if it was just for them, that'd be wrong, too.
[02:55:05.195 --> 02:55:08.256]  But it's for everybody, anybody who doesn't want to be a good little slave.
[02:55:09.477 --> 02:55:14.058]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time on the Global Shortwave at 3210.
[02:55:14.479 --> 02:55:21.581]  During the day, all three hours on Global Shortwave at 9.475 or at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:55:22.141 --> 02:55:26.762]  My new film, American Dictators, documenting the staged election of 2004, is out.
[02:55:26.902 --> 02:55:27.483]  It's excellent.
[02:55:27.543 --> 02:55:36.465]  It's in the Skull and Bones, The New World Order, 9-11, The Police State, and I've got ten other films that are all over two hours long, $25.95 apiece, $19.95 apiece when you order three or more.
[02:55:39.833 --> 02:55:44.536]  And then my book, 9-11, Descent to Tyranny, Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos, those are both excellent.
[02:55:45.037 --> 02:55:51.641]  Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, this thing can't stand if you stand up and expose it.
[02:55:52.201 --> 02:55:56.004]  Already half of New Yorkers and a major Zogby poll believe the globalists were behind 9-11.
[02:55:56.724 --> 02:56:01.788]  We've got to expand that number now with the real history as the globalists try to rewrite it.
[02:56:02.248 --> 02:56:05.069]  See, from day one we've been challenging their official history.
[02:56:05.369 --> 02:56:08.590]  That's why it's accelerated the growth curve of people waking up.
[02:56:08.630 --> 02:56:12.132]  Let's push it over the edge to 80% in the next six months.
[02:56:12.392 --> 02:56:16.173]  Let's expose the murdering traitors of the New World Order.
[02:56:17.033 --> 02:56:21.895]  That means you've got to be a leader to do that.
[02:56:21.915 --> 02:56:29.518]  1-888-253-3139 or watch all the films and read my books and the rest of it at PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[02:56:30.351 --> 02:56:31.375]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:31.415 --> 02:56:32.279]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:32.319 --> 02:56:33.786]  Now get out there and take on the new world order.
[02:56:33.886 --> 02:56:34.710]  Defend humanity!
