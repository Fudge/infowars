[00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:06.493]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.154 --> 00:00:08.215]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.916 --> 00:00:10.037]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:11.498]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:13.160]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.444]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:22.088]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.567 --> 00:00:42.977]  All right, my friends, you're now in the middle of the opening moments, seconds of this Tuesday, the 25th of May, 2004 edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:43.017 --> 00:00:44.418]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:44.458 --> 00:00:46.359]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.845]  We have several guests coming on, including in the third hour, Paul Joseph Watson with his weekly report from the prison planet.
[00:00:54.747 --> 00:01:07.541]  That is PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and of course we also have InfoWars.com all part of my family of websites getting out the truth on a daily basis.
[00:01:09.594 --> 00:01:12.275]  We're going to have wide open phones yet again today.
[00:01:12.315 --> 00:01:14.596]  I want to go to your calls early in this broadcast.
[00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:15.996]  I want to go to them speedily.
[00:01:16.016 --> 00:01:22.278]  I want to take at least 40 phone calls in the next three hours, interspersed with our guests and the news.
[00:01:22.758 --> 00:01:24.538]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:24.558 --> 00:01:29.740]  If you want to respond to Bush's bizarre speech yesterday, skillfully written,
[00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:41.694]  Also, we'll get into the 50 anomalies in the Berg videotape.
[00:01:41.994 --> 00:01:43.815]  This is all going mainstream now.
[00:01:43.955 --> 00:01:51.616]  We're talking Times of London, Asia Times, top forensic experts saying it's all a fake.
[00:01:52.997 --> 00:02:00.679]  Also, Iraqis that have troop veto, they're trying to claim they're going to have some authority, and again that's all smoke and mirrors.
[00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:06.720]  Our appointed minions that work for us will have some power.
[00:02:07.296 --> 00:02:08.178]  Hmm, okay.
[00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:14.407]  Also, digital watermark proved Berg and abuse cameras were the same?
[00:02:14.507 --> 00:02:16.610]  We'll get into that story.
[00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:22.840]  CIA chief pays secret visit to Qatar to silence Al Jazeera.
[00:02:24.306 --> 00:02:25.547]  That's right, Mr. Tenet.
[00:02:25.787 --> 00:02:27.849]  Iraqi scientist killed in U.S.
[00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:29.030]  detention report.
[00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.634]  Another Russian microbiologist dies mysteriously in an Ebola accident.
[00:02:35.175 --> 00:02:37.597]  What's going on with all these microbiologists dying?
[00:02:37.617 --> 00:02:39.118]  Why are people getting rid of them?
[00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.321]  Also, nuclear experiment planned in Nevada.
[00:02:42.341 --> 00:02:47.365]  They may go ahead and end the ban and go ahead with that in a below-ground test.
[00:02:48.783 --> 00:02:52.025]  Britain fights EU proposals for random breath tests.
[00:02:52.045 --> 00:02:55.668]  They want to just pull you over and randomly take your breath test.
[00:02:55.688 --> 00:02:57.209]  Well, hey, we already do that in America.
[00:02:57.229 --> 00:03:02.813]  The Supreme Court just ruled yesterday that you thought you could park your car and walk off and leave it?
[00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:03.934]  No, I've read the ruling.
[00:03:03.974 --> 00:03:04.535]  It's specific.
[00:03:04.575 --> 00:03:06.456]  They can just come into a parking lot and do whatever they want.
[00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:11.430]  And again, the Supreme Court, you know, many years ago said black people weren't human beings.
[00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:12.910]  We don't have to follow that.
[00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.351]  We don't have to follow this ruling either.
[00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:15.211]  It's criminal.
[00:03:15.651 --> 00:03:20.533]  They can say that, you know, Bill Clinton's God, or George Bush's God, doesn't mean it's true.
[00:03:21.713 --> 00:03:25.434]  Also, missing Antonio Tagumba pages.
[00:03:25.534 --> 00:03:27.635]  More dirty tricks in Torturegate.
[00:03:28.115 --> 00:03:30.596]  Remember the Tagumba report out for about a month now?
[00:03:31.517 --> 00:03:35.338]  Turns out there's some missing pages there as well.
[00:03:37.032 --> 00:03:37.252]  F.B.I.
[00:03:37.332 --> 00:03:39.674]  is apologizing to man linked to Madrid.
[00:03:40.295 --> 00:03:42.236]  Bombing this out of Reuters.
[00:03:42.296 --> 00:03:43.157]  Interesting story.
[00:03:43.938 --> 00:03:47.200]  Chuck Baldwin has written another great editorial article.
[00:03:47.301 --> 00:03:50.583]  Our globalist president pushing for a standing U.N.
[00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:51.024]  Army.
[00:03:51.044 --> 00:03:53.306]  And that's what this whole Iraq thing is really about.
[00:03:53.326 --> 00:03:56.748]  At least a large facet of it.
[00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.709]  U.N.
[00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:02.333]  troops buy sex from teenage refugees in the Congo.
[00:04:02.353 --> 00:04:03.334]  I mean, everywhere they go.
[00:04:05.841 --> 00:04:07.902]  The headline is deceptive.
[00:04:07.942 --> 00:04:10.643]  It gets into raping when you read into the story.
[00:04:11.583 --> 00:04:15.584]  Also, Hollywood's chilling disaster movie put spotlight on global warming.
[00:04:16.064 --> 00:04:18.845]  Al Gore is out promoting it.
[00:04:19.786 --> 00:04:24.227]  USA Today says, day after tomorrow, a lot of hot air.
[00:04:25.607 --> 00:04:31.229]  And of course, we'll, as I said, get into Bush's speech and just a lot more.
[00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.270]  RFID tags promoted.
[00:04:34.119 --> 00:04:41.684]  As prizes all over the media selling you that tracking's being fun, the new Coke slogan, you can win but you can't hide.
[00:04:41.704 --> 00:04:42.745]  Ha ha!
[00:04:43.285 --> 00:04:46.267]  It's fun to be tracked like a gerbil in a maze.
[00:04:47.628 --> 00:04:51.550]  It's all coming up after this quick break and your calls.
[00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:55.853]  Any news item you want to bring up, any issue you want to discuss, any questions you've got, 800-259-9231.
[00:05:03.692 --> 00:05:09.197]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.617 --> 00:05:13.840]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:21.106]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:27.592]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.752 --> 00:05:28.953]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.293 --> 00:05:32.235]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:05:32.395 --> 00:05:34.416]  Eliminate the cost, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:05:34.716 --> 00:05:41.960]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.642]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:05:46.082 --> 00:05:54.325]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:05:54.345 --> 00:05:54.966]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:54.986 --> 00:05:55.866]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:56.146 --> 00:05:58.327]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:05:58.687 --> 00:06:00.368]  Call today.
[00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:05.350]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.892]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:14.491]  It's this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:06:14.531 --> 00:06:15.952]  The New World Order.
[00:06:16.773 --> 00:06:17.394]  Anomer.
[00:06:17.654 --> 00:06:21.878]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:21.938 --> 00:06:28.864]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:29.004 --> 00:06:31.006]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:31.246 --> 00:06:41.753]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:41.993 --> 00:06:47.357]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:06:47.877 --> 00:06:50.519]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:51.800]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:52.920]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.281]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:00.485 --> 00:07:03.746]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:07:03.806 --> 00:07:07.988]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:07:08.248 --> 00:07:11.029]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:07:11.209 --> 00:07:13.610]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:22.454]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:07:22.654 --> 00:07:23.994]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:28.336]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:07:28.336 --> 00:07:29.117]  We're good to go!
[00:07:47.697 --> 00:07:48.277]  We're good to go.
[00:08:05.954 --> 00:08:06.615]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.256 --> 00:08:08.317]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.038 --> 00:08:10.139]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.601]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.362 --> 00:08:13.243]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.263 --> 00:08:17.608]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.108 --> 00:08:22.173]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.475 --> 00:08:29.598]  We're now 8 minutes and 25 seconds into this first hour.
[00:08:30.038 --> 00:08:35.581]  Thank you again for joining us on this Tuesday, the 25th of May, 2004.
[00:08:35.641 --> 00:08:40.804]  The websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[00:08:42.264 --> 00:08:45.886]  Again, Paul Watson joins us in the third hour for a news update blitz.
[00:08:46.386 --> 00:08:48.107]  All the key issues will be covering them.
[00:08:48.127 --> 00:08:51.269]  We're going to have open phones throughout the broadcast today.
[00:08:51.289 --> 00:08:53.150]  We're going to cover a ton of vital news.
[00:08:54.285 --> 00:08:58.967]  And information, your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:08:59.107 --> 00:09:03.588]  Vernell and Ben and Anthony and Chris and many others that are patiently holding.
[00:09:04.888 --> 00:09:07.029]  I want to get into Bush's speech last night.
[00:09:07.049 --> 00:09:11.170]  I want to get into the 50 anomalies in the Berg videotape.
[00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:12.791]  This is even in the mainstream news now.
[00:09:12.831 --> 00:09:16.652]  We're talking the Times of London, the Asia Times, you name it.
[00:09:17.652 --> 00:09:21.094]  We'll talk about what type of Iraqi government they're putting into place.
[00:09:21.915 --> 00:09:26.397]  We'll also look at a bunch of different Big Brother developments.
[00:09:26.637 --> 00:09:28.338]  The torture gate being covered up.
[00:09:29.579 --> 00:09:33.641]  This new movie, The Day After, and its propaganda purposes.
[00:09:35.202 --> 00:09:36.303]  And also, Mr. Grasso.
[00:09:36.323 --> 00:09:37.223]  Mr. Grasso.
[00:09:41.064 --> 00:09:50.466]  The former New York Stock Exchange head who got over, now, 200 million dollars as his retirement package.
[00:09:52.586 --> 00:10:05.849]  Just another former CIA kingpin who we have Reuters and AP articles of him in 99 hugging the head of the FARC communist guerrillas in Colombia.
[00:10:06.109 --> 00:10:07.169]  And it is legal!
[00:10:08.309 --> 00:10:23.506]  He went down there and said, and it's a special loophole, invest your money with the New York Stock Exchange from one-third plus of the cocaine that comes out of Columbia or there's going to be a military invasion of your country.
[00:10:24.433 --> 00:10:39.400]  All the spray planes and marines and special forces that go around blowing up the different coca production facilities are going after the communists, are going after those that control their own piece of the land.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:45.162]  The other two-thirds, and this is admitted mainstream, of Colombia are not sprayed.
[00:10:45.643 --> 00:10:47.784]  The coca leaves are grown right out in the open.
[00:10:47.804 --> 00:10:49.684]  They load the cocaine on U.S.
[00:10:49.744 --> 00:10:52.886]  military aircraft and fly it right into your cities.
[00:10:54.344 --> 00:11:09.616]  Mr. Grasso has just been involved in so many very shady activities and now Elliot Spitzer of New York is going after him.
[00:11:11.018 --> 00:11:12.919]  But again, it's just a lawsuit.
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.461]  It should be criminal.
[00:11:16.982 --> 00:11:23.848]  A $200 million payout to the head of the New York Stock Exchange's supposed non-profit group
[00:11:24.859 --> 00:11:26.900]  This is the USA Today headline.
[00:11:27.461 --> 00:11:30.483]  Ugly Court Battle Could Do Collateral Damage.
[00:11:30.563 --> 00:11:35.346]  Case Could Spawn Open Season On Corporate Executives.
[00:11:35.586 --> 00:11:49.735]  The New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's groundbreaking lawsuit against the former head of the New York Stock Exchange is likely to be the first salvo in an ugly legal battle that could further mar the reputation on Wall Street.
[00:11:50.951 --> 00:12:01.276]  Spitzer's 54-page lawsuit, filed Monday, makes Richard Grasso look more like a mafia boss than the head of the world's largest stock exchange.
[00:12:01.656 --> 00:12:08.660]  According to Spitzer, he was never keen on dissent, particularly when it came to his lavish pay.
[00:12:10.477 --> 00:12:24.445]  Fagson, CEO of Big Board Floor Trading, Vander Moolen Specialist, and New York Stock Exchange Board Member, who helped set Grasso's compensation, learned the lesson the hard way.
[00:12:24.925 --> 00:12:30.288]  After privately expressing concern about parts of Grasso's $26.8 million pay package for 2000,
[00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:37.833]  He soon found himself face-to-face with the big board chief renowned for his iron fist rule.
[00:12:38.294 --> 00:12:39.835]  Thank God I escaped that one!
[00:12:41.235 --> 00:12:54.383]  Faginson said, later told state investigators, this man was our regulator and I'm a member of the New York Stock Exchange and when he's your supervisor on your regulator you have to be careful.
[00:12:57.202 --> 00:13:02.543]  We've now got a copy of Spitzer's report, and again, this is really a whitewash, as bad as it sounds.
[00:13:02.963 --> 00:13:03.903]  It's a whitewash.
[00:13:04.403 --> 00:13:05.064]  And it's true.
[00:13:05.384 --> 00:13:06.444]  Mafia bosses.
[00:13:06.964 --> 00:13:18.986]  I mean, when you look at them, just their activities, their behavior, when they testify, the arrogance, the laughing, the giggling, the way they threaten people, the way they operate.
[00:13:19.226 --> 00:13:21.347]  But that's just the cover of the book.
[00:13:21.707 --> 00:13:23.247]  I never judge a book by its cover.
[00:13:24.359 --> 00:13:34.444]  Though, you know, we've all got a good sixth sense, at least we should, and when you're walking down the street, you know the type of person you want to just walk away from, or that exudes criminality.
[00:13:35.865 --> 00:13:37.246]  You know those type of individuals.
[00:13:38.787 --> 00:13:40.347]  Most of them are in government.
[00:13:40.648 --> 00:13:49.092]  And then you read inside the book that is Richard Grasso, and you find out a lot more
[00:13:50.197 --> 00:14:07.871]  I mean, any type of scamming you can imagine, he's involved in it, and telling the board, you give me, you know, $26 million a year, and by the way, now that I'm being forced out for all my corruption, I want $200 plus million dollars!
[00:14:09.833 --> 00:14:11.174]  And, he got it!
[00:14:12.615 --> 00:14:14.957]  And now he faces a lawsuit.
[00:14:14.997 --> 00:14:18.079]  It should be a lot more than that.
[00:14:18.099 --> 00:14:19.100]  So, Dick Grasso,
[00:14:20.023 --> 00:14:23.705]  Pay was nearly equal to the New York Stock Exchange net income.
[00:14:24.385 --> 00:14:34.450]  In a three-year period, the expense of former chairman Dick Grasso's pay was nearly equal to the New York Stock Exchange net income, my friends.
[00:14:35.791 --> 00:14:37.392]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:38.272 --> 00:14:45.456]  And it goes into the last three years what Mr. Grasso made
[00:14:46.757 --> 00:14:54.625]  Grasso, in a three-year period, made a total of $130.2 million.
[00:14:54.925 --> 00:14:59.469]  And then his compensation, no one's actually sure.
[00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.471]  We know it's over $75 million.
[00:15:01.491 --> 00:15:02.352]  That's what we first heard.
[00:15:02.693 --> 00:15:06.476]  Now we're hearing it could be $110 million, so it's well over $200 million.
[00:15:07.898 --> 00:15:11.341]  I mean, I shouldn't laugh about this.
[00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:19.732]  These are the people running the New York Stock Exchange, regulating things with WorldCom and Enron and Halliburton running around.
[00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:24.353]  And there's USA Today.
[00:15:25.113 --> 00:15:26.974]  What was the exact term they used?
[00:15:27.894 --> 00:15:30.175]  More like a Mafia Don?
[00:15:32.055 --> 00:15:37.977]  A report that reads more like he was a Mafia Don than the head of the New York Stock Exchange?
[00:15:40.276 --> 00:15:42.697]  Well, I really couldn't say it any better myself.
[00:15:43.057 --> 00:15:54.040]  And these guys, in front of news cameras, hug, fart, gorilla commanders, and say, you invest your money with us, or hmm, not gonna be good.
[00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.781]  And then the invasion begins.
[00:15:59.202 --> 00:16:00.442]  This is a joke, people.
[00:16:01.482 --> 00:16:03.403]  Some people can't figure out why that they have
[00:16:04.196 --> 00:16:09.360]  SWAT teams raiding houses looking for a single, you know, bag of cocaine here domestically.
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:15.524]  You know, why there's troops in three or four different Latin American countries raiding drug dealers.
[00:16:15.584 --> 00:16:17.926]  Well, what do you mean the government deals the drugs?
[00:16:17.946 --> 00:16:19.187]  They're down there fighting it!
[00:16:19.647 --> 00:16:26.192]  Yeah, just like Al Capone would send his boys over to, you know, with some Tommy guns to machine gun the competition.
[00:16:26.552 --> 00:16:28.193]  Can't you figure this out, folks?
[00:16:28.493 --> 00:16:30.095]  It's real simple!
[00:16:31.115 --> 00:16:32.036]  Real simple!
[00:16:32.668 --> 00:16:47.446]  And then domestically, it's about building up a militarized police force, they go after the low-level drug dealers, then they put them in the private prisons where the same people that deal the drugs and run the New York Stock Exchange own the stock in the private prison companies.
[00:16:47.726 --> 00:16:49.749]  I mean, they make the money coming and going!
[00:16:50.982 --> 00:17:04.470]  They own the companies that sell the SWAT team gear, that sell them the machine guns, that sell them the surveillance pods, that sell them the big brother Echelon, Matrix, Total Information Awareness Network, spying computers.
[00:17:05.011 --> 00:17:10.574]  The Carlisle Group owns the big RFID companies, and the newspapers, and the magazines.
[00:17:10.634 --> 00:17:12.255]  I mean, they own it all!
[00:17:12.315 --> 00:17:13.896]  These people, it's incredible!
[00:17:17.347 --> 00:17:18.488]  Okay, who's up first here?
[00:17:18.508 --> 00:17:20.329]  We're going to go ahead and go to calls early as promised.
[00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:21.170]  Who's up first?
[00:17:22.431 --> 00:17:23.952]  Vernel in Colorado.
[00:17:23.992 --> 00:17:25.073]  Vernel, you're on the air.
[00:17:25.153 --> 00:17:25.554]  Go ahead.
[00:17:25.994 --> 00:17:26.755]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:17:26.775 --> 00:17:30.798]  First of all, I want to say that when you were on George Nureen, you are so fabulous.
[00:17:30.818 --> 00:17:34.581]  You and Steve Quayle have really enlightened mainstream.
[00:17:35.685 --> 00:17:36.346]  Incredibly.
[00:17:36.486 --> 00:17:39.748]  Well, I want to go back on there, so email him and tell him to have me back on.
[00:17:39.828 --> 00:17:40.369]  I will do that.
[00:17:40.449 --> 00:17:42.711]  Okay, what I'm really calling about is Clay Douglas.
[00:17:43.111 --> 00:17:44.532]  I just spoke with his wife this morning.
[00:17:44.552 --> 00:17:52.698]  They have no medical insurance, and I was going to call in and ask you if it would be okay if I announced... Well, let me give people some background on this first.
[00:17:52.758 --> 00:17:55.760]  A lot of people don't know who Clay Douglas is.
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.202]  He's the publisher of an alternative news magazine.
[00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:11.968]  And we were hearing he was going to have brain surgery and all of this, and I called up and talked to him, and he's now in better condition, didn't have to have brain surgery, doesn't have a hole in his skull, doesn't have a bunch of broken bones, and a torn up head.
[00:18:12.529 --> 00:18:14.090]  Is that what she told you this morning?
[00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:16.311]  He's in critical condition.
[00:18:16.331 --> 00:18:22.636]  I mean, what they're worried about now is... I know, but they told me there's not a hole in his head, and he didn't have brain surgery.
[00:18:22.676 --> 00:18:24.477]  No, he's in critical condition.
[00:18:24.517 --> 00:18:28.620]  What I think they're really worried about is, because he has a lot of upper body injuries,
[00:18:30.093 --> 00:18:45.440]  I've actually said people should help him, despite the fact that Clay hasn't been one of my bigger fans, but we're big enough to help somebody who's in need.
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.542]  Well, we're all big enough to help each other because we're all fighting on the same side.
[00:18:50.662 --> 00:18:52.945]  That's right.
[00:18:53.105 --> 00:19:00.112]  After speaking with his wife this morning, I was going to ask if I could give out an address in case people would like to donate for his medical expenses.
[00:19:00.152 --> 00:19:08.300]  Also, there's a motorcycle run that's already been scheduled for June 13th in Phoenix for the people who ride motorcycles who would like to help.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:13.643]  And they can go on the website federalobserver.com to get information on this.
[00:19:14.124 --> 00:19:16.385]  Okay, what's the address real quick?
[00:19:16.745 --> 00:19:18.927]  Okay, it's PO Box 15457, Scottsdale, Arizona.
[00:19:26.278 --> 00:19:37.487]  Alright, thank you for the call, and I'll probably get one of the other members of the family on the show, but no, I was just, I called and talked to their office Sunday, and I said, is Clay having brain surgery?
[00:19:37.507 --> 00:19:38.488]  Does he have a hole in his skull?
[00:19:39.432 --> 00:19:40.333]  Was there foul play?
[00:19:40.373 --> 00:19:41.154]  And they said, no.
[00:19:41.535 --> 00:19:42.696]  We don't think there was foul play.
[00:19:43.237 --> 00:19:44.478]  He doesn't have a hole in his skull.
[00:19:44.498 --> 00:19:48.142]  He has a bad concussion and some broken bones.
[00:19:48.202 --> 00:19:50.765]  He's an older man, so that's pretty serious.
[00:19:50.805 --> 00:19:57.213]  But I was just being positive that, at least right now, he's not on death's doorstep, according to what they told me in his office.
[00:19:57.253 --> 00:19:59.055]  But hey, you know, we'll be right back.
[00:20:02.088 --> 00:20:05.092]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:20:05.452 --> 00:20:14.262]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:20:14.582 --> 00:20:19.268]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:20:19.728 --> 00:20:26.452]  The Murky Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:20:26.853 --> 00:20:38.620]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:43.563]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[00:21:02.707 --> 00:21:03.829]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:07.434]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:21:07.554 --> 00:21:07.975]  Phenol!
[00:21:08.295 --> 00:21:15.364]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:21:15.865 --> 00:21:19.788]  ETA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:21:19.908 --> 00:21:20.349]  Fragrance?
[00:21:20.729 --> 00:21:25.493]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:21:25.633 --> 00:21:30.317]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[00:21:30.537 --> 00:21:33.080]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my CalBen shampoo.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.763]  Well, like all of the products from the CalBen Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:21:36.923 --> 00:21:40.426]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:21:40.646 --> 00:21:43.008]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:21:43.169 --> 00:21:44.049]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:22:01.266 --> 00:22:05.968]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[00:22:06.208 --> 00:22:09.630]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:12.331]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[00:22:12.571 --> 00:22:21.155]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[00:22:21.535 --> 00:22:27.278]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[00:22:27.578 --> 00:22:29.500]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.

[00:23:01.497 --> 00:23:05.080]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.741]  If so, hope has arrived.
[00:23:07.241 --> 00:23:08.662]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[00:23:08.942 --> 00:23:14.106]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[00:23:14.466 --> 00:23:18.949]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:27.955]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[00:23:28.436 --> 00:23:28.916]  Gum disease
[00:23:28.916 --> 00:23:29.556]  Gum disease is serious.
[00:23:30.017 --> 00:23:33.778]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[00:23:34.058 --> 00:23:40.682]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including Vitamir toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.

[00:24:08.734 --> 00:24:11.463]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:24.787 --> 00:24:26.148]  Let's go right back to your calls.
[00:24:26.168 --> 00:24:29.851]  We're going to get into Bush's speech and all this other key news.
[00:24:29.991 --> 00:24:30.812]  Let's talk to Ben.
[00:24:30.872 --> 00:24:32.213]  Ben, where are you calling us from?
[00:24:32.453 --> 00:24:32.873]  New Orleans.
[00:24:33.134 --> 00:24:33.714]  Good to talk to you.
[00:24:33.734 --> 00:24:34.094]  Go ahead.
[00:24:34.395 --> 00:24:34.935]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:24:35.315 --> 00:24:37.097]  I've just been listening for about eight months now.
[00:24:37.517 --> 00:24:39.018]  I woke up about eight months now.
[00:24:40.359 --> 00:24:47.124]  I'm running around trying to tell people about Building 7, which I consider the smoking gun, and three out of five people are kind of waking up.
[00:24:48.085 --> 00:24:49.086]  But here's my question.
[00:24:49.126 --> 00:24:51.168]  I remember I saw in that U.S.
[00:24:51.268 --> 00:24:52.929]  News report, like last week,
[00:24:53.447 --> 00:25:02.711]  That the guy at the White House, I don't know who he was, they didn't say, said that one of the possibilities they were looking at is like sporadic attacks in major cities all over the country?
[00:25:02.971 --> 00:25:08.533]  Well, they said, and I can dig the article out, it's posted just in last week's InfoWars.com archive.
[00:25:09.453 --> 00:25:14.956]  Just go click on that area of the calendar, look in the first few days of last week is when that came out, I believe it was Monday.
[00:25:15.636 --> 00:25:15.816]  U.S.
[00:25:15.836 --> 00:25:17.977]  News & World Report, this week's issue,
[00:25:19.034 --> 00:25:22.596]  And it said in there, the White House told the U.S.
[00:25:22.696 --> 00:25:28.239]  News and World Report that there will be huge attacks all across the U.S.
[00:25:28.739 --> 00:25:35.983]  It will happen, and the two scenarios are the Capitol getting attacked, four sporadic attacks all over the country.
[00:25:36.123 --> 00:25:40.405]  Well, here's what scares me about the second scenario, and I was thinking about this over the weekend.
[00:25:41.385 --> 00:25:46.248]  Say they have these attacks in all the cities, but the terrorists are still among us.
[00:25:46.758 --> 00:25:49.320]  And they don't, we gotta find the terrorists and they're out there.
[00:25:49.701 --> 00:25:52.203]  Wouldn't that just be the perfect excuse for... Well that's it!
[00:25:52.243 --> 00:25:56.366]  No, no, I mean, I mean, we've had Tommy Franks and Eberhardt, they have a Northcom, they've said.
[00:25:56.386 --> 00:26:02.131]  They're gonna have troops on the streets and they're gonna search your house and we're gonna run your lives, but it's for your safety.
[00:26:02.651 --> 00:26:05.834]  It just seems like the perfect setup for the checkpoints, the tanks, the whole nine yards.
[00:26:05.994 --> 00:26:08.176]  That's what they've been drilling to do for 20 years.
[00:26:08.376 --> 00:26:10.378]  I think we should keep our eyes off that scenario.
[00:26:11.425 --> 00:26:34.591]  Well, the good news is, I agree with you, the good news is in a bunch of different places police have actually caught special forces and white guys, they're not Arabs and special forces in the US, planting bombs at power plants, at power stations, trying to plant bombs at different facilities, and police continue to stop them, and then it's just in a local newspaper, and then swept under the rug.
[00:26:34.611 --> 00:26:40.153]  So by the grace of God, local police have foiled these events, and then it's just swept under the rug.
[00:26:40.888 --> 00:26:42.489]  Well, we need the police to step up.
[00:26:42.529 --> 00:26:45.491]  They're really our last line of protection, and they need to wake up quick.
[00:26:45.532 --> 00:26:50.655]  Well, the citizens are, but, you know, the feds are on the news saying, look out for women that look like they're pregnant.
[00:26:50.675 --> 00:26:52.397]  Look for people that smell like chemicals.
[00:26:52.937 --> 00:26:53.457]  No, no, no.
[00:26:53.938 --> 00:26:54.198]  No, no.
[00:26:54.258 --> 00:26:57.200]  Look for guys in black vans with short haircuts.
[00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:57.901]  With an earpiece.
[00:26:58.241 --> 00:26:58.901]  With an earpiece.
[00:26:58.942 --> 00:26:59.382]  There you go.
[00:27:00.282 --> 00:27:01.003]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[00:27:01.083 --> 00:27:02.245]  Great points, Ben.
[00:27:02.666 --> 00:27:04.588]  Anthony, another call from Louisiana.
[00:27:04.628 --> 00:27:05.349]  Go ahead, Anthony.
[00:27:05.369 --> 00:27:06.311]  Hi, Alex.
[00:27:06.391 --> 00:27:13.521]  I've called in a couple of times before, and today I want to ask you if you're going to do another show on the Hover Curve or not.
[00:27:15.484 --> 00:27:16.065]  Say that again?
[00:27:16.939 --> 00:27:19.542]  Are you going to do another show on peak oil?
[00:27:20.643 --> 00:27:22.204]  The Hubbard Peak or what?
[00:27:22.524 --> 00:27:25.727]  Oh yes, you're talking about the peak oil scenario.
[00:27:26.267 --> 00:27:27.368]  I didn't hear what you first said.
[00:27:28.029 --> 00:27:29.690]  I should do some broadcast on that.
[00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:36.997]  I've actually read some news articles, BBC, you name it, on the broadcast about all the giant oil supplies that they've been finding all over the globe.
[00:27:38.798 --> 00:27:49.267]  Yeah, and the reason I was calling about that is because at my school, people in the geology classes are getting told about Hubbard's Curve, and they're really starting to freak out.
[00:27:49.427 --> 00:27:53.210]  And in fact, a lot of people are talking about this now, and I have a feeling that
[00:27:53.826 --> 00:27:59.531]  It's going to come out in mainstream news, and it's own spin, and get everybody freaked out about it.
[00:27:59.611 --> 00:28:02.493]  And that's why you've got to pay $5 a gallon.
[00:28:02.533 --> 00:28:05.936]  Meanwhile, they'll have hundreds of thousands of wells capped.
[00:28:06.396 --> 00:28:07.817]  Huge reserves we can't touch.
[00:28:07.857 --> 00:28:12.841]  But, oh, we have to do this now because there's no oil, and you have to give up your standard of living.
[00:28:12.941 --> 00:28:16.484]  This is the global tax directly to the oil companies.
[00:28:16.844 --> 00:28:24.190]  Exactly, because at my school, they are now telling them about the Hubbard Curve, as if it's a definite fact.
[00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:25.551]  Well, it's like global warming.
[00:28:26.972 --> 00:28:27.712]  It's all over.
[00:28:27.812 --> 00:28:29.794]  But we were due for another ice age now.
[00:28:30.689 --> 00:28:34.374]  And now they admit these spray planes have made the Earth 20% darker.
[00:28:34.414 --> 00:28:35.495]  That's NASA's own numbers.
[00:28:35.735 --> 00:28:38.278]  So they are manipulating the weather, but it's the government doing it.
[00:28:38.599 --> 00:28:40.040]  Yeah, and one last thing.
[00:28:40.361 --> 00:28:48.530]  I know how you feel about Stratfor, but if you look at Stratfor right now, they've given two pieces on how the next attack is coming in Houston, Texas.
[00:28:49.191 --> 00:28:57.120]  It's going to happen at a refinery, and it's going to be through a stolen truck of some sort, and it's going to be some type of bomb.
[00:28:57.521 --> 00:29:08.253]  Yeah, the feds have been putting that out for about two years, and that local intelligence group here in Austin, I've tried to get them on the show, I've read their intelligence, I mean, it's just government mouthpiece behavior.
[00:29:08.773 --> 00:29:09.073]  Okay.
[00:29:09.093 --> 00:29:14.997]  And, uh, I mean, yeah, I mean, it's easy to, I mean, the CFR got on TV months before 9-11 and said, ooh, it's about to happen.
[00:29:15.197 --> 00:29:16.338]  Give your rights up when it happens.
[00:29:16.358 --> 00:29:18.760]  And when it happened, they went, oh, the CFR's so smart!
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:19.780]  How did they know?
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:20.701]  They're incredible!
[00:29:20.721 --> 00:29:22.262]  Alright, thanks, Alex.
[00:29:22.582 --> 00:29:23.423]  Hey, I appreciate it.
[00:29:24.503 --> 00:29:27.684]  Yeah, this business of there's going to be an attack in Houston.
[00:29:27.704 --> 00:29:31.965]  You know, we've had people call us up, oh, this is going to happen.
[00:29:31.985 --> 00:29:34.445]  You know, I'm in the military and I want to meet with you.
[00:29:34.465 --> 00:29:36.205]  And I'm like, no, no, no.
[00:29:36.566 --> 00:29:41.587]  I'm not getting any connections to any provocateurs to create some type of ledger or background op.
[00:29:42.367 --> 00:29:44.027]  Tex Mars has gotten the same calls.
[00:29:44.187 --> 00:29:45.947]  It's been all over the Houston newspapers.
[00:29:46.548 --> 00:29:48.708]  A huge federal operation going on down there.
[00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:54.736]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.678 --> 00:29:58.362]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.111 --> 00:30:03.112]  It's finally here!
[00:30:03.252 --> 00:30:04.232]  Spring has arrived!
[00:30:04.432 --> 00:30:07.373]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:30:07.614 --> 00:30:11.055]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:30:11.275 --> 00:30:19.419]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[00:33:04.354 --> 00:33:10.378]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:33:10.999 --> 00:33:13.981]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:19.905 --> 00:33:24.308]  We're all told that we're on yellow alert, orange alert.
[00:33:25.008 --> 00:33:26.929]  They raise and lower the threat level.
[00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:33.654]  But since 9-11, all of the big cities in the United States have been under red alert.
[00:33:35.114 --> 00:33:39.518]  And they call the police detectives in and go, men, this is top secret.
[00:33:39.558 --> 00:33:40.639]  You can't talk about it.
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:44.323]  You're going to get a federal supplemental paycheck.
[00:33:46.605 --> 00:33:49.747]  There's really been a bunch of other terror attacks in America.
[00:33:50.828 --> 00:33:55.413]  When these refineries blow up or bridges collapse, you know, this is really terrorist.
[00:33:55.473 --> 00:33:57.755]  But we don't want to panic people.
[00:33:59.412 --> 00:34:19.707]  And so we're not going to tell them about it, but this is why we're going to be violating the Bill of Rights and Constitution, this is why you're going to be working with military men, and the CIA is setting up an office in your building, and they'll be advising you and conferring, and we're going to issue these ID badges that you keep on your person at all times that are biometrically scannable with an RFID chip.
[00:34:20.208 --> 00:34:21.709]  And this was going on two, three years ago.
[00:34:24.303 --> 00:34:25.864]  Y2K was a big drill for this.
[00:34:25.884 --> 00:34:28.265]  They all had these badges and were out doing all of this.
[00:34:28.325 --> 00:34:33.168]  They built all these FEMA Emergency Management Centers and these Emergency Roundup Centers.
[00:34:33.668 --> 00:34:35.630]  In my film, The Takeover, I have video of it.
[00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:45.976]  Right here in Austin, the old airport's got an old 747 hangar with bolts and chains and porta-potties and barbed wire right next to the National Guard Armory and they had met on the news.
[00:34:46.056 --> 00:34:47.437]  Hey, it's to put you in!
[00:34:49.489 --> 00:34:51.110]  So this is the stuff that's going on.
[00:34:51.450 --> 00:34:54.452]  And then you see these reports in the Houston Chronicle.
[00:34:54.472 --> 00:34:58.694]  Hey, there might be a plot to attack the refineries.
[00:35:02.094 --> 00:35:25.423]  You know, there's this worker down at a refinery, and he claims that an Arab pulls up and shoots at him, and then all of a sudden they arrest the security guard and say he's a liar, and then all of a sudden, oh, the feds do come out and say, there is a plan to attack Houston, and it's going to happen, and then myself and others get these phone calls, and of course it goes through our
[00:35:26.118 --> 00:35:33.625]  Secretaries and people, I don't even call them back, but, oh, I'm in the military and I'm down here and it's a secret thing and I want to talk to you.
[00:35:34.225 --> 00:35:48.117]  They're trying to create a ledger, a spectrum, a record, a background, kind of like they had McVeigh travel the country and go to every gun show, every conservative group, and try to make that connection.
[00:35:48.618 --> 00:35:50.439]  So they can then later demonize groups.
[00:35:50.519 --> 00:35:53.102]  And the big scenario that you're going to see
[00:35:54.037 --> 00:36:03.869]  In the next wave of attacks, unfortunately, because I've seen them preparing it, via the fiction on television, you know, the fiction programs, and then in the news programs, the same propaganda.
[00:36:03.929 --> 00:36:13.540]  We can tell a lot about what they're going to do from that, and in the newspaper, that, oh, the evil right-wing groups, you know, secret malicious slash white supremacists,
[00:36:14.378 --> 00:36:22.721]  They work with Al-Qaeda and they've teamed up, so now it's the white guys we've got to secretly arrest and take away to the foreign gulags.
[00:36:23.041 --> 00:36:29.144]  When in truth, the white supremacist groups, every time I investigate them, are federally founded and controlled and funded.
[00:36:29.184 --> 00:36:30.604]  We've gone over countless articles.
[00:36:31.365 --> 00:36:34.086]  The neo-Nazis in Germany set up by MI6.
[00:36:34.166 --> 00:36:35.226]  Admit it, mainstream news.
[00:36:35.566 --> 00:36:37.327]  The neo-Nazis in England set up by MI6.
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:42.461]  Neo-Nazi groups, you know, and then you go track down who's got their P.O.
[00:36:42.501 --> 00:36:46.182]  box and it's a Jewish group, you know, it's disgusting!
[00:36:48.463 --> 00:37:02.266]  And so, you know, the key here is, in being politically involved, is to be a part of a land rights organization, or a second amendment group, and to be mainstream about your presentation, and to not get involved with the guy that
[00:37:03.149 --> 00:37:11.475]  Let's sneak around and be real paranoid because the government's going to get us and the guy that wants to talk about, you know, terror attacks with you and where they're going to be next.
[00:37:11.495 --> 00:37:14.797]  I mean, you could spot these guys from a mile because they're so criminal.
[00:37:15.318 --> 00:37:15.878]  Their M.O.
[00:37:15.918 --> 00:37:16.559]  is so criminal.
[00:37:16.599 --> 00:37:26.126]  And if you're unlucky enough to be in an event or something and one of them comes up to you, I mean, they just ooze criminality, that predatory look of how they want to hurt you and your family.
[00:37:27.026 --> 00:37:28.807]  And people have got to get some discernment out there.
[00:37:30.837 --> 00:37:32.238]  It's just amazing.
[00:37:32.739 --> 00:37:40.706]  And then you've got all these little myriad so-called intelligence groups that basically just parrot, that's what I mean by government mouthpiece, parrot what the government says.
[00:37:41.327 --> 00:37:48.794]  And you've got these FBI agents and CIA people and all over the news, we're gonna be hit, we're gonna take your rights.
[00:37:49.415 --> 00:37:52.418]  When you get attacked, give up all your freedom, then you'll be safe.
[00:37:52.478 --> 00:37:55.861]  They're drilling us to what our response is supposed to be.
[00:37:58.201 --> 00:38:08.527]  And our response should be, not what they tell us, to grovel and say, I want to be your slave, but to educate everybody you know about who has a motive for terror attacks.
[00:38:08.847 --> 00:38:16.652]  How the President's own think tank, 25-member think tank, including Dick Cheney, called for helpful terror attacks, helpful Pearl Harbor events.
[00:38:17.345 --> 00:38:24.627]  For this global war in this domestic police state, and expose the prior knowledge of 9-11 and the government involvement.
[00:38:24.967 --> 00:38:30.108]  Expose it like your life and your future and your liberty depends on it, because quite frankly it does.
[00:38:30.868 --> 00:38:37.930]  They're taking America down economically, physically, spiritually, did I mention psychologically?
[00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:40.571]  This is the deconstruction.
[00:38:41.378 --> 00:38:48.984]  And then the leftists like Michael Moore, the fake leftist out there, will tell you the truth about 9-11, but then say, oh, we need the U.N.
[00:38:49.004 --> 00:38:52.346]  to come in and take over America, because America's run by bad people.
[00:38:53.007 --> 00:38:55.369]  The people running America are puppets of Europe!
[00:38:55.989 --> 00:38:57.971]  Even Forbes admits they own this country!
[00:38:58.351 --> 00:39:00.913]  It isn't Japan or China, it's the Europeans!
[00:39:01.233 --> 00:39:03.675]  And they're shutting us down right now!
[00:39:04.215 --> 00:39:06.057]  And letting us be the bad cop in Iraq!
[00:39:06.934 --> 00:39:12.596]  And all the government people, stop denying what you're a part of, look at the facts, and join us!
[00:39:13.416 --> 00:39:23.299]  Those of you that are on the border, who just like to be on, you know, a power trip, who are on the border of being truly evil or just an idiot, stop being an idiot, wake up, join us!
[00:39:24.859 --> 00:39:28.760]  Like Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus, have your epiphany.
[00:39:29.461 --> 00:39:34.262]  You know, realize what you're a part of, join us, stop being part of the evil, stop
[00:39:35.053 --> 00:39:36.093]  I know you feel bad.
[00:39:36.113 --> 00:39:37.694]  I know you're upset with yourself.
[00:39:37.754 --> 00:39:38.954]  I know you're self-destructive.
[00:39:40.295 --> 00:39:41.735]  You know you're part of something evil.
[00:39:42.436 --> 00:39:42.916]  Stop it!
[00:39:43.416 --> 00:39:43.836]  Stop it!
[00:39:43.976 --> 00:39:44.356]  Stop it!
[00:39:44.496 --> 00:39:44.957]  Stop it!
[00:39:45.297 --> 00:39:48.918]  You're afraid of the evil, so you think by joining it, you'll be safe.
[00:39:49.638 --> 00:39:51.819]  And that's not how it works.
[00:39:53.835 --> 00:39:57.139]  Give it to the bully and he'll just push it further and further and further.
[00:39:57.539 --> 00:39:59.522]  And the globalists are far worse than bullies.
[00:39:59.862 --> 00:40:04.888]  They're sociopathic luciferians that love death and sadism.
[00:40:06.449 --> 00:40:09.453]  Before I go to Chris and Ryan and uh...
[00:40:10.595 --> 00:40:14.116]  Many others that are patiently holding, of course, the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:40:14.456 --> 00:40:23.018]  We have Professor Michelle Tosadowski, the professor joining us from Canada to talk about 9-11, the torture, the rest of it.
[00:40:23.258 --> 00:40:25.978]  And we've got Paul Watson in the third hour of this Tuesday edition.
[00:40:26.598 --> 00:40:39.581]  But before I do that, you know, if you want to be a big part of the solution, go get a subscription to PrisonPlanet.tv, where we upload weekly television reports, special reports for you that I do, many documentaries.
[00:40:40.676 --> 00:40:44.757]  The best audio interviews, original text, articles just for members.
[00:40:46.837 --> 00:40:58.380]  It is so important that you go sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv for a monthly subscription of $5.95 or a yearly subscription of $54.95.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:04.241]  It's 15 cents a day with a yearly subscription, 19 cents a day for a monthly subscription.
[00:41:05.301 --> 00:41:07.342]  A cup of coffee at a gas station costs $1.29.
[00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:11.672]  A gallon of gas costs an average of $2.20 now.
[00:41:12.212 --> 00:41:25.022]  I mean, you can spend $0.15 a day, $0.19 a day, depending on how you sign up, and then that helps us fund all our other sites and half the content that's free on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:41:25.343 --> 00:41:30.787]  We reached a point where I was going to be broke if I didn't start charging for something.
[00:41:31.363 --> 00:41:36.308]  And a lot of folks have signed up and a lot more should, so PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:41:36.408 --> 00:41:39.751]  We're fighting the globalists trying to turn Earth into a prison planet.
[00:41:41.052 --> 00:41:51.963]  And also, I've made ten films, I've written a book, I've published a book, I carry a bunch of other great books and videos and books on tape and CDs on tape and pro-gun t-shirts, very liberal stuff here, according to the neocons.
[00:41:52.483 --> 00:41:53.404]  I'm pro-gun, I'm a liberal.
[00:41:54.531 --> 00:42:04.201]  Please get the new Jews of Preservation of Firearms ownership video, Innocence Betrayed, about how governments disarmed people and killed 180 million in the last century alone.
[00:42:05.182 --> 00:42:06.603]  That's a new great video we carry.
[00:42:07.064 --> 00:42:14.010]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free to get the films at 1-888-637-8000.
[00:42:17.039 --> 00:42:17.159]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[00:42:17.179 --> 00:42:17.559]  That's 888-253-3-1-3-9.
[00:42:17.859 --> 00:42:22.261]  Or just write to me, I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[00:42:22.401 --> 00:42:22.682]  Now again,
[00:42:38.369 --> 00:42:49.793]  My videos are $25.95 a piece, all over two hours long a piece, $20 if you order three or more of any of the ten titles I've made, and you're authorized to make copies of my ten videos for non-profit educational purposes.
[00:42:49.833 --> 00:42:50.373]  I want you to.
[00:42:50.733 --> 00:43:01.076]  The other videos and books we carry, obviously you can't copy those because I can't give you authorization to do that, but they're great tools to have a party at your house and show your friends, your neighbors, your family, you know, put them on access television.
[00:43:01.677 --> 00:43:03.057]  So again, make the call.
[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:04.844]  Join us in the fight.
[00:43:04.864 --> 00:43:04.924]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:43:10.636 --> 00:43:12.918]  Let's go ahead and go to Chris in Illinois.
[00:43:12.958 --> 00:43:13.619]  Chris, go ahead.
[00:43:13.879 --> 00:43:16.321]  Hi Alex, I just wanted to say how very insightful you are.
[00:43:16.522 --> 00:43:22.687]  We've been doing this for 30 years and just so your listeners know, it is getting worse and worse and worse.
[00:43:23.188 --> 00:43:30.274]  And it's so incredible that people think, like you said, if they keep their mouths shut, maybe it'll go away because, you know, they laugh at me all the time.
[00:43:30.474 --> 00:43:31.875]  You're going to be the first one in the gulag.
[00:43:31.895 --> 00:43:33.297]  And I say, yeah, you darn too.
[00:43:33.317 --> 00:43:34.077]  And I'm going to fight.
[00:43:34.618 --> 00:43:35.699]  And that's the way it is.
[00:43:35.999 --> 00:43:36.740]  I'm not going down.
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:40.821]  They think if they keep their mouths shut, it'll go away.
[00:43:40.861 --> 00:43:42.162]  Look, governments do this.
[00:43:42.962 --> 00:43:48.584]  Empires train a cadre of people to torture the guy that looks different.
[00:43:48.624 --> 00:43:54.707]  It's always a Jew they torture, an Arab they torture, or if it's a white guy in Africa they torture him.
[00:43:55.167 --> 00:44:02.669]  The government will train their people on the outsider, but that training is really meant for the domestic population.
[00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:09.272]  They're going to have a lot of trouble getting a huge cadre of people to torture citizens.
[00:44:10.753 --> 00:44:13.534]  And that's why all the TV shows now promote torture.
[00:44:13.554 --> 00:44:16.596]  They're trying to change our morals that torture is good.
[00:44:16.856 --> 00:44:18.376]  And they're not winning that fight.
[00:44:18.877 --> 00:44:20.818]  And so, they're going to fail.
[00:44:20.958 --> 00:44:23.539]  They don't have the evil forces they need.
[00:44:23.579 --> 00:44:25.520]  That's why they're having to bring in foreigners right now.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:28.221]  There's two ways that works.
[00:44:28.501 --> 00:44:38.185]  They can bring in foreign Hessians, Germans, like the British did, or now about 20-30% of the military is foreign, Latin Americans.
[00:44:38.585 --> 00:44:48.129]  They can bring in a foreigner who will torture you, or they can train our own people torturing foreigners, getting them to have a taste for it, and then bringing them back here.
[00:44:48.169 --> 00:44:48.510]  Go ahead.
[00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:51.811]  Speaking about torture, I was reading an article too about
[00:44:52.151 --> 00:44:58.715]  How this is bringing up the ICC again, because we're so terrible now we do need, you know, the International Criminal Court.
[00:44:58.735 --> 00:44:59.875]  That's what Michael Moore is saying.
[00:44:59.915 --> 00:45:11.322]  See, I tell you the truth about the problem, but then the solution is, well, one of Al Capone's henchmen was bad, so Al Capone is going to have a trial for him.
[00:45:11.902 --> 00:45:16.985]  Another thing too, like Tex always said, sometimes pieces make up the big puzzle.
[00:45:17.365 --> 00:45:23.551]  So I don't know if you know this, but they did shut off Jekyll Island last week.
[00:45:24.512 --> 00:45:25.713]  There were military out there.
[00:45:26.453 --> 00:45:29.116]  Yeah, they're having urban warfare training all over the country.
[00:45:29.536 --> 00:45:30.177]  Jekyll Island, too.
[00:45:30.217 --> 00:45:34.901]  I didn't know if it was part of the Build-A-Burgers, because I know they're supposed to be in Italy.
[00:45:35.141 --> 00:45:37.423]  So I was just wondering if that might be part of it, too.
[00:45:37.924 --> 00:45:38.244]  I don't know.
[00:45:39.425 --> 00:45:43.549]  But yeah, one of our friends down there was going to go fishing, and he couldn't get through.
[00:45:44.218 --> 00:45:45.919]  Jekyll Island, because it was cordoned off.
[00:45:45.959 --> 00:45:51.681]  Well, they're probably having a meeting, you know, they're having a Bilderberg Group meeting coming up in about a week in Italy.
[00:45:51.701 --> 00:45:52.581]  Right, in Italy.
[00:45:52.801 --> 00:45:56.082]  And they have Bilderberg Group steering meetings at Jekyll Island.
[00:45:56.422 --> 00:46:03.845]  They've shut down the Library of Congress, and it said, oh, there goes the Senators and people into the, you know, Lord Rothschild's here going into a secret meeting, no big deal.
[00:46:03.945 --> 00:46:04.165]  Right.
[00:46:04.525 --> 00:46:08.747]  You know, it's just, people, you know, I've been doing this for 30 years, it's still,
[00:46:09.347 --> 00:46:11.089]  And sometimes, you know, my mouth drops open.
[00:46:11.129 --> 00:46:15.274]  I can't... Well, like I always used to tell my kids, the devil is evil, not stupid.
[00:46:15.955 --> 00:46:17.036]  But at any rate, uh...
[00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:22.404]  Doing it for 30 years, I'm still flabbergasted at the time, the way these things come off.
[00:46:22.724 --> 00:46:28.150]  And, you know, people, you try to talk to them, and they just look at you, they give you this blank stare, you know, like, you've got to be kidding.
[00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:30.972]  Well, somebody that gives you that blank stare doesn't even count.
[00:46:31.252 --> 00:46:34.576]  We should ignore the people that want to be cattle-like, furniture-like.
[00:46:35.076 --> 00:46:38.299]  It was 5% that started and won the Revolutionary War.
[00:46:38.319 --> 00:46:41.582]  We've just got to be more motivated and get our country back.
[00:46:41.602 --> 00:46:42.083]  Thanks for the call.
[00:46:42.703 --> 00:46:43.283]  I appreciate it.
[00:46:43.403 --> 00:46:44.444]  Ryan in Ohio.
[00:46:44.524 --> 00:46:45.324]  Ryan, go ahead.
[00:46:45.804 --> 00:46:46.064]  Yes.
[00:46:46.184 --> 00:46:46.764]  Hello, Alex.
[00:46:46.964 --> 00:46:47.324]  Hello.
[00:46:47.664 --> 00:46:49.545]  I got a conspiracy theory for you.
[00:46:50.585 --> 00:47:01.768]  I think George Bush, such a coward, that the reason he wanted to attack Iraq was because of his daddy, because Saddam supposedly tried to kill his dad.
[00:47:02.409 --> 00:47:08.970]  So that was his reason for going in there, even though that wasn't the reason for his real men, the guys that control him.
[00:47:11.673 --> 00:47:18.995]  And then a couple times when he started to wake up, like the one time he got the Shiner and said he passed out, I think he started saying, I can't do this.
[00:47:19.235 --> 00:47:23.456]  One of his, one of his, um, one of his boys says, whacked him upside the head, said, shut up.
[00:47:23.496 --> 00:47:24.357]  You're doing what we say.
[00:47:25.057 --> 00:47:28.878]  Then the other day before his speech, he supposedly wiped out on his bike.
[00:47:28.998 --> 00:47:31.099]  I think they roughed him up again and told him to shut up.
[00:47:31.479 --> 00:47:32.239]  He's a coward.
[00:47:32.939 --> 00:47:34.940]  And by roughing him up, he'll do what they say.
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:36.180]  Okay.
[00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:39.061]  Uh, it might sound like a little, um, uh,
[00:47:40.111 --> 00:47:40.611]  I don't know.
[00:48:01.964 --> 00:48:05.706]  Uh, and at the same time, I mean, he could have had a mountain bike wreck.
[00:48:05.766 --> 00:48:07.688]  I mean, anybody's mountain bike has had that happen.
[00:48:08.248 --> 00:48:09.549]  I mean, he's a young president.
[00:48:09.569 --> 00:48:13.931]  I mean, he got hit by a car when he was governor jogging downtown.
[00:48:14.812 --> 00:48:18.574]  Uh, so, you know, I mean, that's a big part of this.
[00:48:18.634 --> 00:48:21.055]  See, see, this is the difference between this show and a lot of others.
[00:48:21.936 --> 00:48:26.819]  I don't speculate very often, or if I do, it's off of a hundred different facts laid together.
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:32.323]  And, you know, just to say they're beating up the president, he doesn't run anything to begin with.
[00:48:32.343 --> 00:48:34.524]  He just signs what's put in front of him.
[00:48:34.604 --> 00:48:40.788]  Even a president with 165 IQ like Kennedy couldn't run everything because it's so complex.
[00:48:41.488 --> 00:48:45.251]  I mean, I have trouble running my own life because I'm so busy and I'm not a president.
[00:48:45.731 --> 00:48:48.393]  I'm just a busy radio talk show host, documentary filmmaker.
[00:48:49.033 --> 00:48:57.218]  So, to then say, oh, they're beating Bush up, I just, you know, just to say that, I don't think is good.
[00:48:58.345 --> 00:48:59.749]  Not good, huh?
[00:48:59.769 --> 00:49:05.083]  Well, I mean, you know, because I live in the realm of documents and legislation and bills.
[00:49:06.005 --> 00:49:11.127]  And, you know, and that's hard enough to believe that the government says they want every child to take a microchip.
[00:49:11.427 --> 00:49:12.687]  That's hard to get people to believe.
[00:49:12.947 --> 00:49:17.048]  It's hard to get them to believe that there's a national draft introduced in Congress.
[00:49:17.108 --> 00:49:19.409]  When it's admitted fact, people still deny it.
[00:49:19.509 --> 00:49:24.731]  So, I have no idea if somebody beat Bush up, and it doesn't make sense, because he's not the president anyway.
[00:49:24.751 --> 00:49:25.571]  He's a total puppet.
[00:49:25.871 --> 00:49:29.032]  He was, I mean, because he was going to give a speech, and he says, I can't give this speech.
[00:49:29.052 --> 00:49:30.913]  They said, you're giving a speech or else, buddy.
[00:49:30.953 --> 00:49:33.253]  He goes, OK, I'm sorry, I'll do it.
[00:49:33.313 --> 00:49:34.514]  OK, thanks for the call.
[00:49:34.994 --> 00:49:35.554]  I appreciate it.
[00:49:36.645 --> 00:49:38.010]  Let's talk to Tom in Texas.
[00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:38.772]  Tom, go ahead.
[00:49:39.983 --> 00:49:40.744]  Yes, Alex.
[00:49:41.064 --> 00:49:41.344]  Yes.
[00:49:41.444 --> 00:49:47.908]  I tried to call you yesterday, had to hang up and get back to work there, but this I guess is a Black Helicopter Report.
[00:49:47.968 --> 00:49:52.811]  I'm down here by Corpus Christi, where CKED, which is Corpus Christi Army Depot, is.
[00:49:52.991 --> 00:49:53.292]  Uh-huh.
[00:49:53.592 --> 00:49:56.714]  They do helicopter repair for the Marines.
[00:49:57.454 --> 00:50:00.996]  Yeah, they had Delta Force raids down in Corpus in 99.
[00:50:01.357 --> 00:50:02.097]  Yes, they did.
[00:50:02.117 --> 00:50:02.878]  Yes, indeed.
[00:50:02.958 --> 00:50:09.542]  And I worked out of that town a lot, Port Aransas, where they took over their little town, ran the UN flag up at the post office.
[00:50:10.129 --> 00:50:11.971]  Hey, people feel safe out there now.
[00:50:12.812 --> 00:50:16.677]  Foreign troops running around, screaming, and King's Hall buildings blowing up.
[00:50:16.737 --> 00:50:17.618]  It's all part of the freedom.
[00:50:18.079 --> 00:50:22.424]  But last Monday and Tuesday, I was over to haul that yard by here where they haul boats.
[00:50:22.604 --> 00:50:24.026]  You can see these islands, St.
[00:50:24.066 --> 00:50:29.633]  Joseph and Padre Island, which is where they practice landing when they do repairs at Seacad as well.
[00:50:30.069 --> 00:50:35.194]  They had a whole fleet of the little, look-like-bell-tiered, uh, drones.
[00:50:35.214 --> 00:50:37.256]  Yeah, those are the command and control choppers.
[00:50:37.556 --> 00:50:40.739]  And, yeah, they had a whole bunch, and they're all black.
[00:50:41.195 --> 00:50:42.435]  Got a real close look.
[00:50:42.475 --> 00:50:43.516]  They're real quiet.
[00:50:43.536 --> 00:50:44.736]  They just kind of whoosh.
[00:50:44.796 --> 00:50:52.238]  You don't hear that, that, that, that to do with big... Yeah, that's a surveillance, uh, intelligence gathering and then an engagement.
[00:50:52.278 --> 00:50:53.979]  It'll be used as a command helicopter.
[00:50:54.259 --> 00:50:57.420]  I'll have two Delta Force operators out on the, out on the slats.
[00:50:57.980 --> 00:50:58.360]  Stay there.
[00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:00.201]  I'll let you talk more about it when we get back.
[00:51:01.545 --> 00:51:08.129]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.169 --> 00:51:10.070]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:12.451]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.611 --> 00:51:14.692]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:14.972 --> 00:51:19.915]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.255 --> 00:51:24.277]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.537 --> 00:51:26.318]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.378 --> 00:51:37.040]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.081]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:51:39.281 --> 00:51:43.142]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns of the info war.
[00:51:43.242 --> 00:51:44.462]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533139.
[00:51:44.662 --> 00:51:44.882]  That's 888-2533139.
[00:51:51.624 --> 00:51:55.335]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[00:51:55.615 --> 00:51:56.317]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:52:00.643 --> 00:52:03.645]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:52:03.965 --> 00:52:08.888]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.148 --> 00:52:13.510]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:13.791 --> 00:52:22.716]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:22.916 --> 00:52:26.558]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:26.838 --> 00:52:31.867]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.167 --> 00:52:38.898]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:52:39.379 --> 00:52:39.920]  What about you?
[00:52:40.666 --> 00:52:46.028]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:52:46.068 --> 00:52:47.168]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:52:47.248 --> 00:52:49.129]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:53:01.767 --> 00:53:02.107]  I think so.
[00:53:16.992 --> 00:53:17.653]  We're good to go!
[00:53:46.534 --> 00:53:49.616]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:49.776 --> 00:53:55.739]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:01.762 --> 00:54:10.367]  Alright, we've got Professor Michelle Klesodosky from Canada to talk about the torture 9-11.
[00:54:15.999 --> 00:54:19.521]  The Military-Industrial Complex, very intelligent gentlemen joining us the next hour.
[00:54:19.542 --> 00:54:22.443]  We'll take calls as well early in that hour.
[00:54:23.304 --> 00:54:26.266]  And we will also, of course, have Paul Watson on.
[00:54:26.346 --> 00:54:30.329]  He joins us at least once a week in the third hour for this Tuesday edition.
[00:54:31.275 --> 00:54:33.256]  Let's try to get through a couple of calls in this segment.
[00:54:33.916 --> 00:54:36.377]  Let's let Tom in Texas finish up.
[00:54:37.137 --> 00:54:40.438]  How many of these little command and control choppers are out there?
[00:54:40.938 --> 00:54:45.320]  Well, when it started out, I was on a friend of mine's sailboat over at Haul Out Yard.
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:46.660]  You can see all the long ways.
[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:48.461]  There were three of them working together.
[00:54:49.001 --> 00:54:50.261]  They flew right over.
[00:54:50.301 --> 00:54:56.283]  It's not like they stayed on the island like they usually do, so they're not visible and flying over popular.
[00:54:56.904 --> 00:54:59.765]  These guys were both in the ship channel, the intercoastal.
[00:55:01.434 --> 00:55:12.919]  We were listening to your program on that shortwave radio when this happened, and you were into a good rant, I must say, and we put it on the bullhorn while these helicopters flew around, the black helicopters.
[00:55:13.419 --> 00:55:18.281]  It was like they were almost there on cue, or your program was on cue, one of the two.
[00:55:18.661 --> 00:55:19.702]  But that was three of them.
[00:55:19.762 --> 00:55:23.984]  Then there was just a big mass of them, like 20, maybe 25,
[00:55:25.564 --> 00:55:31.208]  All grouped up in a file and I got to see a lot of the new devices hanging off of these.
[00:55:31.308 --> 00:55:32.910]  I've seen them back in 97.
[00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:34.451]  Real close look.
[00:55:34.491 --> 00:55:42.837]  Now they've got what look like miniature Vulcan guns, rocket launchers, strange parabolic dish antennas, a vast array of antennas.
[00:55:46.661 --> 00:55:48.183]  It's like in Nazi Germany.
[00:55:48.223 --> 00:55:51.146]  They expanded the Waffen or armed SS near the end.
[00:55:51.766 --> 00:55:52.928]  And the same thing's happening.
[00:55:52.948 --> 00:55:54.749]  These groups aren't as elite anymore.
[00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:59.574]  They're radically expanding the squadrons, as they call them, of Delta Force and others.
[00:56:00.455 --> 00:56:02.778]  And, uh, so you're probably just seeing training ops.
[00:56:02.838 --> 00:56:03.799]  Hey, thanks for the call, man.
[00:56:03.839 --> 00:56:04.600]  That'd be a great video.
[00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:05.801]  I wish you had a video camera of that.
[00:56:06.414 --> 00:56:07.235]  Some video tape of that.
[00:56:07.256 --> 00:56:08.017]  That's very interesting.
[00:56:08.818 --> 00:56:11.762]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ed in Pennsylvania.
[00:56:11.862 --> 00:56:12.483]  Ed, go ahead.
[00:56:12.503 --> 00:56:13.285]  Hi, Alex.
[00:56:13.605 --> 00:56:14.406]  I've been trying.
[00:56:14.446 --> 00:56:16.910]  I guess you guys are rebroadcasting a lot in the evenings.
[00:56:17.351 --> 00:56:18.733]  I haven't been able to get anything but a
[00:56:19.803 --> 00:56:23.446]  I don't know what that means, but go ahead, sir.
[00:56:24.207 --> 00:56:25.748]  I've been trying to get on the program.
[00:56:26.049 --> 00:56:28.390]  Oh, you've been calling and you get the... Okay, but go ahead, sir.
[00:56:28.611 --> 00:56:30.232]  No busy signal, just keeps ringing.
[00:56:30.332 --> 00:56:30.692]  I understand.
[00:56:30.712 --> 00:56:31.153]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:56:31.333 --> 00:56:41.862]  Okay, we had an incident during our primary elections in western Pennsylvania where about five or six people were running for a person who was a state rep who was retiring.
[00:56:42.642 --> 00:56:48.207]  They all got threatening letters and they poo-pooed that and then
[00:56:49.355 --> 00:57:04.633]  The morning of the primaries, this Sam Kolowinko, who I talked to maybe two weeks before... Okay, give us, you know what, these type of calls, you know, I say you can call me about whatever you want, but, I mean, I know you're calling in from Pennsylvania.
[00:57:05.194 --> 00:57:05.755]  That's about it.
[00:57:06.678 --> 00:57:11.299]  And then you talk about stuff going on with primaries, threatening letters, and somebody's name on the show.
[00:57:11.499 --> 00:57:13.480]  I just... You've got to give me some background.
[00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:18.841]  I have no... I mean... Yeah, this lady that was Congresswoman is retiring.
[00:57:18.981 --> 00:57:22.282]  So there's five or six of them running for her position in the primaries.
[00:57:22.322 --> 00:57:24.083]  Yeah, well we had that here in Austin.
[00:57:24.163 --> 00:57:31.905]  We had a new... The fella I was helping out was getting no help from the Democratic money people in any form.
[00:57:32.583 --> 00:57:35.225]  So, I was helping, other people were helping.
[00:57:35.245 --> 00:57:42.109]  Here, he committed suicide, they say, an hour before the polls opened on primary election day.
[00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:43.750]  Now, that is very suspicious.
[00:57:43.790 --> 00:57:45.210]  I wish you'd send me some info on that.
[00:57:45.350 --> 00:57:45.771]  I did.
[00:57:45.791 --> 00:57:53.535]  I sent it to, not the 3001, to the other one that I got from one of your fellas on the order line.
[00:57:53.855 --> 00:57:54.136]  Okay.
[00:57:54.756 --> 00:57:56.977]  And there's a newspaper clipping of it.
[00:57:57.157 --> 00:57:59.999]  It's very, very suspicious, and I suspect that
[00:58:00.635 --> 00:58:13.938]  The local coroner and the local chief of police must be in on this because you don't shoot yourself in the neck with your rifle to commit suicide and you don't do it an hour before the primaries open so you can find out whether you won or not.
[00:58:14.298 --> 00:58:23.460]  He came in second even though everybody left the polls that was working for him by noon because they found out from the news that he had supposedly committed suicide.
[00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:31.626]  Well, see, it'll be much easier once the Diebold machines are in, because then there won't even be any real race, and then they won't have to go after people.
[00:58:31.666 --> 00:58:33.747]  But that is very, very suspicious.
[00:58:34.348 --> 00:58:45.055]  I know that in the New District 10 race that Clear Channel owned the voting machines that their candidate voted on, I know that some of the people got threatened as well that were running against him.
[00:58:45.075 --> 00:58:47.477]  We don't know if he was threatening them, probably not, but somebody was.
[00:58:47.897 --> 00:58:49.038]  So thank you for the call.
[00:58:52.193 --> 00:58:55.075]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:58:55.415 --> 00:58:58.296]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:58:58.516 --> 00:59:04.720]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:12.404]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:59:12.584 --> 00:59:16.686]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[00:59:16.966 --> 00:59:22.489]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[00:59:22.689 --> 00:59:35.815]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.
[00:59:36.015 --> 00:59:39.837]  Get this hard-to-find information by ordering Fruit and Places U.S.A.
[00:59:40.037 --> 00:59:44.559]  now for only $29 plus shipping and handling by calling New Millennium at

[00:59:57.969 --> 00:59:58.629]  Big Brother.
[00:59:59.290 --> 01:00:00.370]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:01.051 --> 01:00:02.192]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.212 --> 01:00:03.633]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.393 --> 01:00:05.414]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.974 --> 01:00:09.937]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.138 --> 01:00:14.221]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.813 --> 01:00:35.280]  All right, we have a professor we've had on many times in the past, Michelle Kosodowski, professor up in Canada, the author of War and Globalization.
[01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:39.197]  And they have a great website that's even featured some of the articles I've written.
[01:00:39.317 --> 01:00:40.379]  Very intelligent man.
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:44.866]  They've got a big symposium going on very soon up in Canada that you'll want to visit if you're in the area.
[01:00:45.447 --> 01:00:48.232]  Concerning 9-11, I wish I could go.
[01:00:48.252 --> 01:00:50.656]  I'm just too busy here doing the radio broadcast.
[01:00:53.164 --> 01:00:56.346]  Also, we'll tell you how to get that book a little bit later in the show.
[01:00:56.826 --> 01:01:01.649]  I just thought, this morning, we need to get Professor Trosadowski on because of his incredible research.
[01:01:02.189 --> 01:01:06.611]  You know, he was talking about torture a long time before it was in our news, just like we've been doing.
[01:01:06.931 --> 01:01:09.633]  Talking about 9-11 as well.
[01:01:09.733 --> 01:01:17.457]  I want to get into Richard Grasso being called a mafia chief by Elliot Spencer, the Attorney General of New York.
[01:01:18.559 --> 01:01:27.303]  I want to talk about the military-industrial complex that is turning America and the world into its private cash machine at the expense of our lives and freedom.
[01:01:27.763 --> 01:01:32.665]  So joining us is Professor Michel Chossodosky, and we will go to your calls early in this hour.
[01:01:32.725 --> 01:01:33.806]  Professor, good to have you on.
[01:01:34.186 --> 01:01:35.647]  It's great to be on the show, Alex.
[01:01:36.667 --> 01:01:38.748]  Tell us about your great website first.
[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:46.627]  Well, the website is globalresearch.ca.
[01:01:46.887 --> 01:01:56.195]  It essentially brings forth analysis on a daily basis, background research.
[01:01:56.235 --> 01:01:59.118]  We have quite a number of people who are regular contributors.
[01:01:59.736 --> 01:02:03.117]  And then we also publish a magazine which is called Global Outlook.
[01:02:03.397 --> 01:02:05.117]  It's an excellent one.
[01:02:05.157 --> 01:02:06.297]  It's not left or right.
[01:02:06.397 --> 01:02:07.338]  It's the truth.
[01:02:07.798 --> 01:02:09.158]  Well, that's what we try to do.
[01:02:09.638 --> 01:02:15.419]  And we publish pieces from a broad spectrum of opinion, both right and left.
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:19.180]  Our main criterion is, is it relevant?
[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:20.060]  Is it relevant?
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:22.281]  Does it present the facts?
[01:02:22.881 --> 01:02:25.461]  And we try to provide a little bit of background.
[01:02:25.521 --> 01:02:28.082]  For instance, there was a whole issue on torture
[01:02:28.681 --> 01:02:29.822]  And that's, of course, Negroponte!
[01:02:59.001 --> 01:03:05.327]  So-called ambassador, I wonder to whom he's going to be presenting his credentials, because there is no government.
[01:03:05.567 --> 01:03:11.271]  Well, look at Shalebi, another torture master from Iran, a convicted bank robber.
[01:03:11.311 --> 01:03:12.452]  That's who they hire.
[01:03:12.532 --> 01:03:14.254]  I mean, these are their boys.
[01:03:14.574 --> 01:03:15.315]  Well, that's right.
[01:03:15.355 --> 01:03:19.018]  Although Shalebi has a problem, because nobody
[01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:26.813]  Really, I mean, it's unlikely that he could form a government with the kind of track record he has.
[01:03:26.853 --> 01:03:29.894]  Well, that's why they're staging this ruse between Bush and him.
[01:03:30.215 --> 01:03:32.476]  Well, I think so.
[01:03:32.776 --> 01:03:42.420]  We brought out a piece just a couple of days ago on the fact that Shalabi is essentially this raid on his house where they said the U.S.
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.541]  forces attacked him and so on and so forth.
[01:03:44.561 --> 01:03:46.802]  This is a staged event because
[01:03:47.421 --> 01:03:50.383]  Essentially, Shalabi is a creature of the CIA.
[01:03:50.503 --> 01:04:00.811]  No one fired a gun, he's at the State of the Union, he's been trained to go in and take over, he staged the cutting down of the statue, he staged the little rallies, and this is staged too!
[01:04:01.672 --> 01:04:03.813]  He even told the Associated Press!
[01:04:04.153 --> 01:04:12.900]  I've looked at it from various angles, I think it's staged because they are accusing him of sharing intelligence with Iranians, but in fact,
[01:04:13.539 --> 01:04:28.885]  When he goes to Iran, he goes there on behalf of the United States, and his advisor, Francis Brooke, reports directly back to Wolfowitz, and in fact, Shalabi and Wolfowitz are buddies.
[01:04:28.965 --> 01:04:33.787]  I mean, they went to school in Chicago together, Chicago University.
[01:04:33.867 --> 01:04:36.068]  Yeah, under Strauss.
[01:04:36.963 --> 01:04:37.984]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:04:38.144 --> 01:04:38.904]  We'll come right back.
[01:04:38.964 --> 01:04:40.145]  I want to get into the torture.

[01:06:51.937 --> 01:06:57.459]  Old-timers remember a time when things were a bit slower, and most folks really did take the time to stop and smell the roses.
[01:06:57.699 --> 01:07:03.300]  That was back when gardeners grew tomatoes that tasted like tomato, and watermelons that tasted like watermelon was supposed to.
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.821]  Sweet corn that was real sweet sweet corn.
[01:07:05.981 --> 01:07:07.021]  Well, you get the idea.
[01:07:07.201 --> 01:07:17.084]  Too bad the big seed companies became big green companies, and decided that hybrids grown in hothouses, artificially ripened with gas, could be grown much quicker, fetching more money at the large grocery stores.
[01:07:17.384 --> 01:07:26.892]  Folks at the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company remember that simpler time and are proud to be offering non-GMO heirloom seeds to gardeners who value flavor and variety over speed and greed.
[01:07:27.092 --> 01:07:36.240]  There's seed for fruits and vegetables of all kinds, seed for flowers and herbs, annuals and perennials, and some great books written by experts in the field to help get you started on the road to success.

[01:07:53.226 --> 01:08:00.951]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:04.893 --> 01:08:05.894]  I know we have callers.
[01:08:06.054 --> 01:08:11.878]  Holden, we'll get to your calls here real quick, because it'll all tie in with our guest looking at the real geopolitical
[01:08:12.778 --> 01:08:14.900]  Spectrum, The Real Landscape.
[01:08:15.161 --> 01:08:18.324]  He is Professor Michael Chossodosky up in Canada.
[01:08:18.724 --> 01:08:26.351]  He's going to be with us for the rest of the hour, even into the next if he has time, when Paul Joseph Watson from England, one of our great analysts, joins us.
[01:08:27.292 --> 01:08:31.116]  So everybody that's patiently holding, Carlos and Brian and others will get to your calls.
[01:08:31.176 --> 01:08:31.696]  Stay there.
[01:08:32.537 --> 01:08:35.380]  Professor Chossodosky, let's go through this in a
[01:08:36.210 --> 01:08:47.019]  Uh, you know, focused fashion because I have a tendency to get you, you know, off into other tangents because I kind of have a scattershot approach, but... We all have a scattershot approach in this crazy world.
[01:08:47.219 --> 01:08:52.764]  Exactly, there's so much going on, but first, first, I just want to state, our government
[01:08:53.214 --> 01:08:56.917]  The illegitimate elements of it for 50 years have trained the world how to torture.
[01:08:56.997 --> 01:08:58.679]  It's admitted they ordered this torture.
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:02.762]  It is incredible that they will deny that they've now done this.
[01:09:02.982 --> 01:09:14.072]  So I want to ask you, the history of the torture briefly and then why you think CBS brought this out at this time when we already knew about the torture and had photos and video that had been in the foreign press.
[01:09:14.492 --> 01:09:24.383]  And now where you think this is going, then next I want to get into how the government is saying we will have huge terror attacks, we're going to have to take your rights, top generals talking about martial law.
[01:09:24.563 --> 01:09:25.805]  But let's get into torture first.
[01:09:26.165 --> 01:09:33.993]  Well I mean, if you look at the CIA torture manuals, all the ingredients of this torturing are there.
[01:09:35.418 --> 01:09:42.501]  The practice of making prisoners go naked is something which actually goes back to the Spanish Inquisition.
[01:09:43.062 --> 01:09:58.188]  But I mean, if you look at Negroponte's background, the future ambassador, so-called ambassador, what he did in Honduras and Nicaragua was to set up this intelligence unit known as Battalion 316.
[01:09:58.808 --> 01:10:00.949]  It was a CIA battalion.
[01:10:04.126 --> 01:10:14.675]  The declassified documents pointed to the fact that the CIA was instrumental in first in training and equipping this battalion.
[01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:24.148]  Uh, they were, they were, uh, they gave them the, you know, the method for, for actually, uh, torturing people.
[01:10:24.628 --> 01:10:29.229]  They used, uh, shock and suffocation devices in their interrogations.
[01:10:29.249 --> 01:10:31.910]  Uh, prisoners were kept naked.
[01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:37.292]  And that's, that's the copper green manual of the, of the torture chair submerging you in water.
[01:10:38.346 --> 01:10:42.229]  Yeah, well, I haven't done all the research on this.
[01:10:42.329 --> 01:10:45.832]  I'm just quoting from some of the documents we've posted.
[01:10:45.852 --> 01:10:53.238]  I think the other thing, which is of course very indicting, is this Red Cross report.
[01:10:54.479 --> 01:10:56.380]  The International Committee of the Red Cross.
[01:10:57.641 --> 01:11:02.165]  We posted the complete document, the complete text, which was leaked to the Wall Street Journal.
[01:11:02.885 --> 01:11:05.468]  But there's something else which
[01:11:07.897 --> 01:11:10.159]  Which we followed carefully.
[01:11:10.879 --> 01:11:26.010]  You might remember that on April 8th, when they pulled down the statue in Baghdad, that same day, they killed the ICRC representative, who happened to be a Canadian.
[01:11:27.011 --> 01:11:30.674]  It didn't make front page news, it wasn't front page news.
[01:11:31.354 --> 01:11:36.358]  They said that six vehicles of the Red Cross were caught in crossfire that day.
[01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:54.018]  But the Red Cross was collaborating with Iraqi health authorities trying to bring first aid to civilians who were wounded in the hospitals and everything points to the fact that they actually
[01:11:55.427 --> 01:11:57.107]  Shot at the Red Cross.
[01:11:57.328 --> 01:12:06.230]  Well, Professor, we have Associated Press mainstream articles on the Newswire, never in the paper, where our troops were ordered to target journalism.
[01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:08.391]  Oh yeah, well that's of course.
[01:12:08.511 --> 01:12:13.692]  They targeted in the Baghdad Hotel, Reuters reporters with an Abrams tank.
[01:12:13.732 --> 01:12:14.792]  They were ordered to kill them.
[01:12:14.992 --> 01:12:17.993]  Well, that happened also in April 8th, or thereabouts.
[01:12:18.093 --> 01:12:21.194]  I mean, that's exactly what they were doing.
[01:12:21.554 --> 01:12:26.819]  They had these embedded journalists, and then they said, well, let's go and kill whoever isn't embedded with us.
[01:12:26.859 --> 01:12:27.439]  We kill them.
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:28.861]  And they did that.
[01:12:29.401 --> 01:12:34.686]  And they also killed the Red Cross rep who was in charge of logistics.
[01:12:35.506 --> 01:12:41.692]  And as a result of that, the International Committee of the Red Cross, which monitors war crimes,
[01:12:42.713 --> 01:12:55.620]  And the detention of POWs significantly reduced their presence in Iraq in the wake of April 8th, which was the time when the troops came in to so-called liberate Iraq.
[01:12:56.621 --> 01:12:58.502]  Let me stop you right there since you brought that up.
[01:12:58.522 --> 01:13:00.363]  I want to digress out of torture for a moment.
[01:13:00.996 --> 01:13:04.058]  They appointed this 300-something member group.
[01:13:04.498 --> 01:13:09.961]  Now they're going to appoint another group and they go, quote, our appointees will have autonomy.
[01:13:10.061 --> 01:13:13.503]  But if you work for me, you don't have autonomy.
[01:13:14.284 --> 01:13:16.125]  And that's exactly what they've done.
[01:13:16.145 --> 01:13:20.207]  And they call this democracy when no one's elected.
[01:13:20.448 --> 01:13:22.809]  Now Bush says, well, we'll have a general election later.
[01:13:23.049 --> 01:13:26.111]  The question is, will Diebold, you know, run that?
[01:13:27.179 --> 01:13:34.965]  Well, I mean, this idea of installing democracy in countries under occupation is a big farce.
[01:13:35.025 --> 01:13:53.781]  I mean, we saw what happened in Afghanistan when Hamid Karzai, who was actually selected by the so-called international community at a meeting in Germany, and then all of a sudden he becomes Prime Minister and then President of a country, and it just so happens he's a former
[01:13:54.621 --> 01:13:56.942]  I think that that is in fact a little bit more crude in a sense.
[01:14:15.446 --> 01:14:25.876]  Because what you're installing, you're installing money launderers and, you know, Shalabi is a money launderer, Hamid Karzai is the same.
[01:14:25.916 --> 01:14:28.678]  I mean, these guys are, they're criminals.
[01:14:29.539 --> 01:14:36.145]  And the criminals are overshadowed by the big criminals, the war criminals who sit in the White House and the Pentagon.
[01:14:36.465 --> 01:14:41.410]  Okay, let's shift out of the, well, answer the question, Omi, and I want to get your take on the torture.
[01:14:41.970 --> 01:14:50.238]  I think CBS brought these out on purpose as a political distraction, then to bring out the Berg Beheading to legitimize all of this.
[01:14:50.258 --> 01:14:53.221]  I mean, they've had all this forever.
[01:14:53.522 --> 01:14:55.724]  Why did they now decide to bring this out?
[01:14:56.424 --> 01:15:01.349]  Well, that's... You know, maybe those images would get out in any case.
[01:15:01.489 --> 01:15:06.134]  That's one interpretation, but certainly I think that right now
[01:15:08.407 --> 01:15:14.191]  The people are pulling the strings behind the scenes, which is the military-industrial complex.
[01:15:14.891 --> 01:15:17.873]  Lockheed Martin calls the shots on US foreign policy.
[01:15:17.913 --> 01:15:30.901]  Well, perhaps they've decided that this guy, George W. Bush, has spent his time in the White House, and he's only going to be an embarrassment for the next election, and we'd rather not
[01:15:31.859 --> 01:15:34.221]  Uh, put our eggs all into one basket.
[01:15:34.341 --> 01:15:43.529]  And besides, besides, this will make the international community look good to punish Bush, when really it was the international community that was involved in all of this, using us as the puppet.
[01:15:43.849 --> 01:15:45.931]  And Kerry says he's going to stay in Iraq.
[01:15:46.151 --> 01:15:47.672]  Kerry agrees with all the policies.
[01:15:48.513 --> 01:15:49.133]  Absolutely.
[01:15:49.194 --> 01:15:52.696]  I mean, Kerry is going to ensure continuity.
[01:15:52.997 --> 01:15:55.759]  I think we have to understand that these guys are puppets.
[01:15:56.577 --> 01:16:14.404]  They don't actually, perhaps Bush is more of a puppet than Kerry, but ultimately when Kerry gets into the White House, if he gets into the White House, he will be subjected to the same controls, the same pressures from the CIA, the Pentagon, and so on.
[01:16:14.444 --> 01:16:15.244]  Let me stop you at the end.
[01:16:15.264 --> 01:16:16.685]  You talked about organized criminals.
[01:16:16.705 --> 01:16:18.205]  Here's USA Today today.
[01:16:18.225 --> 01:16:21.967]  Ugly court battle could do collateral damage in the Richard Grasso case.
[01:16:22.527 --> 01:16:31.533]  Spitzer's 54-page lawsuit, New York Attorney General, filed Monday makes Richard Grasso look more like a mafia boss than the head of the world's largest stock exchange.
[01:16:32.273 --> 01:16:35.536]  And he ordered his employees to give him $200 million.
[01:16:36.136 --> 01:16:40.219]  I mean, that's to give you an idea of the type of people we're dealing with.
[01:16:40.259 --> 01:16:46.783]  And in 1999, Grasso went down and told the FARC in Columbia, invest your money with us or we're going to invade you.
[01:16:46.823 --> 01:16:47.643]  That was in Reuters.
[01:16:47.864 --> 01:16:49.084]  And then it happened, Professor.
[01:16:49.685 --> 01:16:49.965]  Yeah.
[01:16:51.054 --> 01:17:13.230]  I haven't followed the case, but I think the thing about criminalization, when we have people in, let's say, in high office, who are committing war crimes, not petty crimes, war crimes,
[01:17:13.815 --> 01:17:15.877]  They're violating the Geneva Convention.
[01:17:16.777 --> 01:17:19.019]  They're ordering the torture of civilians.
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:24.082]  They are violating the Nuremberg Charter and so on.
[01:17:24.723 --> 01:17:31.648]  But ultimately, these people also decide who are the war criminals from their point of view.
[01:17:31.808 --> 01:17:34.550]  And they set up, of course, they set up the kangaroo courts.
[01:17:35.114 --> 01:17:39.537]  They send off people to Guantanamo, they arrest people whom they don't like, and so on and so forth.
[01:17:39.857 --> 01:17:42.198]  That is called the criminalization of the state.
[01:17:42.698 --> 01:17:50.343]  When war criminals have the legitimacy to decide who the war criminals actually are, when they themselves are the war criminals.
[01:17:50.923 --> 01:17:54.164]  And I think that is what's happening in America.
[01:17:54.184 --> 01:17:56.965]  Well, it's Bush saying, we'll arrest anybody with Al Qaeda ties.
[01:17:57.045 --> 01:17:59.166]  Nobody's got Al Qaeda ties like Bush!
[01:17:59.446 --> 01:18:00.006]  Well, of course.
[01:18:00.066 --> 01:18:02.587]  He's the guy who has most Al Qaeda ties.
[01:18:02.967 --> 01:18:07.949]  And all the other guys, Colin Powell, Richard Armitage, they all have Al Qaeda ties.
[01:18:08.889 --> 01:18:12.670]  I mean, they were part of the Ron Contra scandal and so on and so forth.
[01:18:12.730 --> 01:18:14.891]  Chairman Keene has these ties.
[01:18:15.808 --> 01:18:18.213]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:18:18.293 --> 01:18:19.455]  I mean, look, look, look.
[01:18:19.615 --> 01:18:23.603]  Professor, if you or I had this many ties, we would be at Guantanamo right now.
[01:18:24.679 --> 01:18:25.440]  We'd be dead!
[01:18:27.341 --> 01:18:33.566]  But the thing is that the people who are sent to Guantanamo don't have ties to... And that's been in the L.A.
[01:18:33.606 --> 01:18:33.926]  Times!
[01:18:33.946 --> 01:18:41.972]  They just grab some innocent people to create the torture, then they fly out the Taliban and Al-Qaeda leaders out of Afghanistan because they work for the CIA!
[01:18:42.472 --> 01:18:46.916]  But exactly, and that was the basis when Seymour Hersh revealed his getaway,
[01:18:47.656 --> 01:19:02.790]  The actual so-called enemy combatants, people who were actually fighting when they occupied Afghanistan in late October of 2001, the actual Al-Qaeda fighters were liberated.
[01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:10.938]  They were airlifted to Pakistan and so they had to fill the concentration camp in Guantanamo
[01:19:11.368 --> 01:19:24.239]  With civilians, and in fact, that is the diabolical plan, is that the actual Al-Qaeda fighters were, which are created by the CIA, we know that, they were flown out of Afghanistan.
[01:19:24.339 --> 01:19:28.442]  And then the mainstream media admits it, but says it was an accident, Professor.
[01:19:28.783 --> 01:19:33.887]  Yeah, no, the mainstream media admits it because it came out in Seymour Hersh's article in the New Yorker.
[01:19:34.307 --> 01:19:43.756]  But the thing is that Seymour Hersh, which I think is a great guy, he doesn't push the analysis further and say, well, who are these people in Guantanamo?
[01:19:44.337 --> 01:19:45.678]  The people in Guantanamo... I'll tell you what, stay there.
[01:19:45.958 --> 01:19:46.338]  Stay there.
[01:19:46.378 --> 01:19:46.919]  We got a break.
[01:19:46.939 --> 01:19:48.000]  We'll come back, take a few calls.
[01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:51.123]  I don't want to get into these terror attacks they say that are going to happen.
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:55.401]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:19:55.501 --> 01:19:59.622]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:19:59.742 --> 01:20:02.623]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:20:02.703 --> 01:20:09.385]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:20:09.605 --> 01:20:12.606]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:20:12.806 --> 01:20:15.208]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:20:15.348 --> 01:20:25.452]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as actazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[01:20:25.452 --> 01:20:34.794]  For MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[01:20:34.954 --> 01:20:42.555]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of black murky purification elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:20:42.575 --> 01:20:42.915]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:20:42.955 --> 01:20:44.356]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.

[01:21:24.151 --> 01:21:27.573]  Or get the deluxe kit that adds barley grass seed and sunflower greens.
[01:21:27.813 --> 01:21:32.736]  The health benefits of wheatgrass are legendary, but perhaps one of the best benefits are the antioxidants.
[01:21:32.996 --> 01:21:36.439]  Research is showing that antioxidants are instrumental in preventing cancer.
[01:21:36.679 --> 01:21:41.643]  At wheatgrasskits.com, you'll find the best available price on a huge variety of wheatgrass juicers.

[01:21:54.412 --> 01:21:56.193]  Jack Brownerig for Midas Resources.
[01:21:56.694 --> 01:22:00.116]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[01:22:00.616 --> 01:22:01.237]  Let's update.
[01:22:01.792 --> 01:22:05.234]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[01:22:05.894 --> 01:22:09.616]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[01:22:10.296 --> 01:22:11.237]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[01:22:11.277 --> 01:22:13.598]  dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[01:22:14.118 --> 01:22:15.018]  Today, the U.S.
[01:22:15.038 --> 01:22:17.279]  dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:19.200]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[01:22:19.781 --> 01:22:21.762]  January of 2002, the gold spot was 283.
[01:22:23.102 --> 01:22:27.984]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[01:22:28.965 --> 01:22:29.725]  Gold is moving.
[01:22:29.965 --> 01:22:31.106]  Equities are treading water.
[01:22:31.533 --> 01:22:34.175]  This is a little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[01:22:34.715 --> 01:22:36.096]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[01:22:36.536 --> 01:22:38.258]  Physical possession, private gold.
[01:22:38.658 --> 01:22:40.639]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[01:22:41.039 --> 01:22:43.161]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[01:22:45.322 --> 01:22:47.464]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.
[01:22:47.844 --> 01:22:48.144]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.001 --> 01:22:55.362]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:22:55.603 --> 01:22:59.445]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:22:59.765 --> 01:23:00.586]  Read the labels.
[01:23:01.026 --> 01:23:05.148]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:23:05.368 --> 01:23:09.551]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:23:09.931 --> 01:23:14.794]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:23:15.174 --> 01:23:18.756]  Now, just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:23:18.956 --> 01:23:24.299]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:23:24.559 --> 01:23:27.300]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:23:27.601 --> 01:23:28.501]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:23:42.749 --> 01:23:44.111]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:23:44.251 --> 01:23:45.852]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:06.625 --> 01:24:13.516]  If you have a question or a comment for Professor Michelle Chossodosky from Canada at globalresearch.ca,
[01:24:15.519 --> 01:24:21.864]  You're welcome to call in at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:24:21.884 --> 01:24:22.545]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:24:24.366 --> 01:24:32.553]  Professor, in the next segment, I want to get into the government saying there will be massive terror attacks, we're going to put troops on the streets, it's all for your own good.
[01:24:32.573 --> 01:24:38.478]  I want to get into the 9-11 whitewash commission, the symposium you guys are putting on up in Canada, exposing this.
[01:24:38.498 --> 01:24:40.319]  But first, let's go ahead and take a couple calls.
[01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:43.422]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Texas.
[01:24:43.482 --> 01:24:44.402]  Brian, you're on the air.
[01:24:44.463 --> 01:24:44.823]  Go ahead.
[01:24:45.481 --> 01:24:46.522]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:24:46.742 --> 01:24:52.386]  Of course you heard about the explosion at the chemical plant this morning, right?
[01:24:53.787 --> 01:24:54.368]  No, I didn't.
[01:24:54.688 --> 01:24:57.690]  I was talking about it, though, how the feds were probably going to pull something.
[01:24:57.730 --> 01:24:58.330]  Where was it?
[01:24:58.751 --> 01:25:00.112]  I believe it was in Georgia.
[01:25:01.204 --> 01:25:04.807]  Well, now, chemical plants do have explosions, do have problems.
[01:25:05.628 --> 01:25:16.817]  That does happen, but the government's been saying we're going to have lots of these all over, but then what they do is they tell the police it's terror, but don't tell the public to create this underground fear in the establishment.
[01:25:16.877 --> 01:25:17.298]  Professor?
[01:25:18.599 --> 01:25:29.008]  Well, I haven't... I saw the news about this explosion, but I don't think we can really
[01:25:30.493 --> 01:25:32.174]  I'm not sure that I can comment on that right now.
[01:25:32.194 --> 01:25:36.318]  Well, I'll tell you what, give us the details of what you saw, Brian.
[01:25:36.978 --> 01:25:46.045]  Well, I haven't got very much on it, except that they expect the fire to burn at least for the next 12 hours, and it was at a chlorine plant.
[01:25:47.026 --> 01:25:58.414]  But I had a question about, for the professor, about, we have down here a wild lands project, and I was wondering if
[01:25:59.898 --> 01:26:03.060]  The professor had heard anything like that for Canada as well.
[01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:10.603]  It's kind of out of the professor's expertise, the land grab stuff going on.
[01:26:11.184 --> 01:26:12.164]  Oh, the land grab?
[01:26:12.985 --> 01:26:15.346]  You mean land which is grabbed by what?
[01:26:15.386 --> 01:26:18.307]  By private government?
[01:26:18.688 --> 01:26:26.452]  Well, actually, big banks are behind a large portion of the phony environmental movement involved in taking people's private property.
[01:26:26.492 --> 01:26:27.172]  Any comments on that?
[01:26:28.812 --> 01:26:31.573]  Well, I'm not sure whether I can address that.
[01:26:32.994 --> 01:26:37.016]  I know that this is taking place, but I haven't done research on it, unfortunately.
[01:26:37.336 --> 01:26:37.716]  All right.
[01:26:37.976 --> 01:26:39.417]  Thanks for the call, Brian.
[01:26:40.477 --> 01:26:41.678]  Rich in Pennsylvania.
[01:26:41.718 --> 01:26:42.278]  You're on the air.
[01:26:42.338 --> 01:26:42.778]  Go ahead.
[01:26:43.098 --> 01:26:43.418]  Yeah.
[01:26:43.598 --> 01:26:45.479]  Praise Jesus, Alex, my brother in Christ.
[01:26:45.599 --> 01:26:50.001]  You know, the Bible says that thieves come not but to steal, kill, and destroy.
[01:26:50.021 --> 01:26:52.142]  I appreciate what your professor's saying.
[01:26:52.822 --> 01:26:56.404]  He's a knowledgeable guy, and we need to hear a lot from people like that.
[01:26:57.250 --> 01:27:07.516]  A suggestion I have for you, buddy Alex, is that every time you use the phraseology, the New World Order, you would add satanic in front of it and call what it is a satanic New World Order.
[01:27:07.917 --> 01:27:11.559]  Well, I'll tell you what, let me get a response from the professor on that.
[01:27:12.039 --> 01:27:13.560]  We know about Skull and Bones.
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:15.241]  We know about Bohemian Grove.
[01:27:16.342 --> 01:27:19.564]  We know that many of the elite are involved in bizarre activities.
[01:27:20.402 --> 01:27:27.386]  And even if you don't believe in God, you should be concerned that these people do, and they believe in the bad God, and this really is going on.
[01:27:27.426 --> 01:27:30.007]  Have you done any research into skull and bones, bohemian growth?
[01:27:30.027 --> 01:27:44.494]  Well, I mean, I'm familiar with skull and bones, and I'm familiar with all the various, you know, secret societies, like the Bilderbergers, the Trilateral Commission, of course, the Council of Foreign Relations up to a point is also a secret society.
[01:27:44.514 --> 01:27:47.335]  Well, what part does this all play in your research?
[01:27:47.575 --> 01:27:48.656]  Well, I mean,
[01:27:50.089 --> 01:27:54.372]  Inevitably, people plan the New World Order.
[01:27:54.552 --> 01:28:04.797]  You know, these are very powerful people, they're heads of corporations, they're CIA, they're military, and so on, and they meet, and they meet behind closed doors.
[01:28:05.337 --> 01:28:12.221]  And to say that, it's not a question of looking at it from the point of view of conspiracy, there are military actors
[01:28:12.782 --> 01:28:16.283]  They're financial actors, and they do consult.
[01:28:16.303 --> 01:28:20.204]  I'll give you an example, which virtually nobody knows about.
[01:28:20.224 --> 01:28:39.048]  On the 6th of August of last year, which was Hiroshima Day, there was a secret meeting in the Offutt Air Force Base where they called in the military-industrial complex and the nuclear industry and said, guys, let's define nuclear war together.
[01:28:39.268 --> 01:28:41.008]  They privatized nuclear war.
[01:28:41.730 --> 01:28:58.589]  And they also subsequently, in a Senate decision, they decided to more or less give a green light to use the tactical nuclear weapons as conventional weapons in conventional war theatres.
[01:28:58.629 --> 01:29:02.434]  So that there was a very major decision on essentially
[01:29:03.174 --> 01:29:10.936]  The recategorizing nuclear weapons, which was taken in a secret meeting with the private sector and some very powerful people.
[01:29:12.057 --> 01:29:17.598]  And now they're saying, even in minor conflicts, they may use nuclear weapons.
[01:29:17.678 --> 01:29:18.518]  Oh, it's no big deal.
[01:29:18.538 --> 01:29:19.219]  It's good for you.
[01:29:19.719 --> 01:29:20.499]  Well, exactly.
[01:29:20.619 --> 01:29:23.340]  But, I mean, to sell that idea
[01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:25.441]  To the public, first of all.
[01:29:25.521 --> 01:29:27.942]  Well, to sell it also to the scientific community.
[01:29:28.002 --> 01:29:29.503]  Well, it's like depleted uranium.
[01:29:29.583 --> 01:29:33.565]  Yeah, you have to do a little bit of plotting behind closed doors.
[01:29:33.965 --> 01:29:36.286]  And these guys do meet.
[01:29:36.867 --> 01:29:37.747]  And they do plot.
[01:29:38.007 --> 01:29:39.428]  We've got a break.
[01:29:39.468 --> 01:29:40.449]  We'll be back.
[01:29:40.469 --> 01:29:40.869]  Stay with us.
[01:29:43.890 --> 01:29:44.791]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.271 --> 01:29:46.892]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.812 --> 01:29:50.494]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:54.412 --> 01:29:57.396]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:29:57.757 --> 01:30:06.588]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments, like a local or national emergency.
[01:30:06.909 --> 01:30:11.595]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:30:12.035 --> 01:30:18.777]  The Murky Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:30:19.177 --> 01:30:30.961]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:30:31.421 --> 01:30:35.886]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:30:54.993 --> 01:30:55.933]  Spring has arrived!
[01:30:56.153 --> 01:30:59.114]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:30:59.334 --> 01:31:02.796]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:31:03.016 --> 01:31:11.159]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[01:32:06.077 --> 01:32:13.103]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:32:13.483 --> 01:32:19.608]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:32:19.748 --> 01:32:20.949]  There are no side effects.
[01:32:21.289 --> 01:32:24.231]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:32:24.391 --> 01:32:26.413]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:32:26.713 --> 01:32:33.958]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:32:34.258 --> 01:32:37.641]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:32:53.852 --> 01:33:00.661]  Alright, more of your calls coming up here in just a few minutes at 800-259-9231.
[01:33:00.701 --> 01:33:03.044]  We're talking to Professor Michael
[01:33:11.410 --> 01:33:22.696]  Professor, before we go back into the news, I want to talk about these upcoming terror attacks and the globalist big plan, what the world will be like from your research if they succeed, and then ways to stop them.
[01:33:22.736 --> 01:33:30.880]  But before we do that, tell folks about yourself, where you're a professor, the book you've written, global research, the website, the magazine.
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:31.461]  Tell us about it.
[01:33:32.181 --> 01:33:37.264]  Well, I teach at the University of Ottawa, which is Canada's capital.
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:39.961]  I've been there for quite a number of years.
[01:33:39.981 --> 01:33:45.542]  I actually teach economics and more recently got involved in more in foreign policy issues.
[01:33:45.982 --> 01:33:51.384]  I've been researching Al-Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden for at least 10 or 12 years.
[01:33:51.884 --> 01:33:53.985]  I would say probably since the late 80s.
[01:33:54.805 --> 01:34:02.868]  And we now run a website which is globalresearch.ca
[01:34:04.675 --> 01:34:10.457]  Um, and we have a magazine, uh, which is called Global Outlook Magazine, which you can order.
[01:34:10.917 --> 01:34:17.199]  You can order this, um, through a 1-800 number, which is... It's also on some newsstands in Austin.
[01:34:17.679 --> 01:34:18.339]  That's correct.
[01:34:18.639 --> 01:34:18.879]  Yeah.
[01:34:19.279 --> 01:34:20.400]  So it's on newsstands.
[01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:23.521]  Our distribution isn't very good, but in any case, it's 1-888.
[01:34:25.588 --> 01:34:25.768]  713-8500.
[01:34:25.868 --> 01:34:29.189]  That's our phone number.
[01:34:29.509 --> 01:34:32.610]  Or you can go online to globalresearch.ca.
[01:34:32.670 --> 01:34:34.311]  Well, give that phone number out again.
[01:34:34.331 --> 01:34:35.051]  1-888-713-8500.
[01:34:35.091 --> 01:34:37.852]  Also, coming up, you're going to have a 9-11 symposium.
[01:34:37.872 --> 01:34:41.673]  Yeah, the 9-11 symposium is starting on Thursday.
[01:34:41.693 --> 01:34:43.113]  In fact, it's already started with films and
[01:34:54.073 --> 01:35:19.291]  and audio and video material uh... and uh... it's going to last until uh... until sunday uh... so uh... i will be uh... uh... attending the opening session on uh... on thursday morning presenting the and where is that that's being held in toronto at the ukrainian uh... center if they go to our website there's uh... there's uh...
[01:35:19.918 --> 01:35:22.559]  You know, there's a link to the program.
[01:35:22.719 --> 01:35:24.680]  Yeah, certainly a lot of key stuff.
[01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:25.581]  People should attend that.
[01:35:25.961 --> 01:35:27.802]  Now, I want to get into, did you see U.S.
[01:35:27.842 --> 01:35:45.571]  News and World Report, where they said the White House tells us we will have massive attacks, then we've got all these top generals saying martial laws are good, and the next step, and I mean, they're really... Yeah, well, I've been following that from the statement of Tommy Franks in Cigar Aficionado.
[01:35:45.651 --> 01:35:45.931]  He said
[01:35:48.286 --> 01:35:50.868]  I mean, and it's a disturbing statement.
[01:35:50.908 --> 01:35:55.732]  He said that there's going to be a terror attack on U.S.
[01:35:55.812 --> 01:35:56.272]  soil.
[01:35:56.412 --> 01:35:59.455]  And we're going to set aside the Constitution for a military government.
[01:35:59.915 --> 01:36:00.896]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:36:00.996 --> 01:36:02.417]  Essentially, that's what he says.
[01:36:02.637 --> 01:36:05.520]  And it's a very strong statement.
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:10.363]  Did you see what Eberhardt, the head of NORTHCOM, said to the L.A.
[01:36:10.403 --> 01:36:10.784]  Times?
[01:36:11.488 --> 01:36:12.668]  No, I haven't seen that.
[01:36:13.048 --> 01:36:13.308]  No.
[01:36:13.688 --> 01:36:15.449]  Yeah, it didn't get as much attention.
[01:36:15.489 --> 01:36:18.569]  He said, he said, look, you know, the Pentagon is watching you.
[01:36:18.609 --> 01:36:21.250]  We are going to have troops on the streets and it's a good thing.
[01:36:22.370 --> 01:36:22.630]  Yeah.
[01:36:22.970 --> 01:36:37.553]  Essentially what these people are saying, because it also comes up in Tommy Frank's statement, he talks about a massive casualty producing event, which I'll quote, I have the quote in front of me.
[01:36:38.109 --> 01:37:02.675]  Franks identifies a scenario whereby, in fact, military rule could be established and he says, quote, a terrorist, massive casualty producing event will occur somewhere in the Western world and maybe in the United States of America that causes our population to question our own constitution and to begin to militarize our country in order to avoid
[01:37:03.351 --> 01:37:06.512]  A repeat of another mass casualty producing event.
[01:37:06.532 --> 01:37:10.533]  So he tells us the solution is to go into a military dictatorship.
[01:37:10.833 --> 01:37:24.376]  Well he's saying essentially that the solution to preserve democracy is military dictatorship and he says that if there is a mass casualty event
[01:37:25.383 --> 01:37:30.730]  Or even a red-code alert, well obviously then the country closes down.
[01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:32.973]  And so that's what all of this is.
[01:37:33.013 --> 01:37:38.179]  And again, in our constitutional republic, the difference between that and pure democracy, this is anathema.
[01:37:38.239 --> 01:37:39.260]  I mean, it's the opposite.
[01:37:39.301 --> 01:37:40.302]  It's like anti-matter.
[01:37:40.742 --> 01:37:43.526]  Well absolutely, but the thing is that they've already
[01:37:43.986 --> 01:37:50.230]  It's not something which should be excluded, because a number of analysts have actually said, yes, it will happen.
[01:37:50.290 --> 01:37:50.730]  Look, look, look.
[01:37:50.990 --> 01:38:00.455]  Professor, I've been covering the police state for 10 years, and they've been drilling to take over our cities, take over our towns, arrest citizens, put us in work camps.
[01:38:00.816 --> 01:38:02.497]  The executive orders have been there for 30 years.
[01:38:03.697 --> 01:38:09.279]  And now they're really making their move, and they're saying we will have massive attacks this year.
[01:38:09.299 --> 01:38:11.660]  I mean, that's the White House, U.S.
[01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:12.740]  News & World Report.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.221]  We know who's going to be behind it, who has the motive.
[01:38:15.661 --> 01:38:20.203]  What's your response to that, and what should our response politically be to it?
[01:38:20.363 --> 01:38:32.387]  Well, I find it extremely disturbing, because first of all, I know that the so-called outside enemy, which is Al-Qaeda, is fabricated by the CIA.
[01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:42.343]  So if they're saying that Al-Qaeda is going to attack America, that means that they're behind Al-Qaeda.
[01:38:42.784 --> 01:38:51.927]  They are, in a sense, also planning or at least establishing the scenario of those massive casualty-producing events.
[01:38:52.067 --> 01:38:53.148]  It's very disturbing.
[01:38:53.568 --> 01:38:59.530]  And when somebody like Tommy Franks makes that statement,
[01:39:00.604 --> 01:39:06.787]  Uh, which he made to a, to a, you know, to a magazine, which is pretty, it's called Cigar Afficcionado.
[01:39:06.847 --> 01:39:10.149]  It's an entertainment magazine, but, but then he was quoted.
[01:39:10.169 --> 01:39:12.630]  It, it means that
[01:39:13.513 --> 01:39:17.675]  He's making that statement not as an individual, but as a member of the military.
[01:39:17.855 --> 01:39:21.998]  Well, he's making it to condition us so that we will accept it.
[01:39:22.038 --> 01:39:24.859]  That magazine goes out to all the white-collar executives.
[01:39:24.899 --> 01:39:25.579]  Yeah, right.
[01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:26.340]  Okay.
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:29.902]  But, I mean, he's also... It's an acclamation.
[01:39:30.302 --> 01:39:33.364]  He illustrates the talking points within the military.
[01:39:33.824 --> 01:39:37.166]  The fact that this kind of stuff is already on the agenda.
[01:39:37.206 --> 01:39:37.886]  They're saying, well,
[01:39:38.730 --> 01:39:44.935]  You know, we must envisage the scenarios for massive counter-producing events.
[01:39:45.215 --> 01:39:54.822]  I mean, there's another thing, is all these exercises which were conducted under the auspices of Homeland Security.
[01:39:55.282 --> 01:40:03.588]  They had anti-terrorist exercises, which took place about a year ago,
[01:40:04.481 --> 01:40:31.572]  and uh... they look at procedures what happens let's say when uh... you know when when you have a record alert and in effect the country uh... to the quote the quote was from Sid Casperson the head of FEMA in New Jersey and Gannett News Service he said under a red alert virtually all liberties are stripped you're an enemy combatant you're not allowed to leave your home then the Washington Post said they're going to take all of our children out of the public schools and not let us have them
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:42.967]  Yeah, well there were many statements, and I think that then Tom Ridge went on record and he said, if we go to Red Code Alert, we close down the country.
[01:40:43.307 --> 01:40:54.936]  That's what he said, I mean, and what he means by that, essentially, that the whole civilian governmental system is replaced by a military regime.
[01:40:55.715 --> 01:40:59.380]  And they have the procedures under FEMA to do it.
[01:41:00.081 --> 01:41:03.586]  So we built this giant military industrial complex, the shadow government.
[01:41:03.987 --> 01:41:09.394]  It's now publicly beginning the process of replacing what was left of the old republic.
[01:41:11.033 --> 01:41:13.994]  Yeah, I think that that is what's happening.
[01:41:14.034 --> 01:41:19.595]  Now, whether this will happen or not is anybody's... You know, there are various scenarios.
[01:41:19.615 --> 01:41:21.856]  Yeah, here's the question.
[01:41:21.996 --> 01:41:28.318]  They'll do it if they think they can get away with it, but if we expose that they're the terrorists, then they can't go ahead with the program.
[01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:33.483]  Well, but on the other hand, you always have John Kerry to ensure continuity, you see.
[01:41:34.904 --> 01:41:50.135]  This is a bogus democracy to start with, so whether it goes to military rule, or whether we have the militarization of civilian institutions under a formally constitutional government, it doesn't really fundamentally modify things.
[01:41:50.215 --> 01:41:54.979]  Yeah, so via the smokescreen of getting ready for it, they go ahead and implement it slowly.
[01:41:55.900 --> 01:41:57.141]  Yeah, I would say that.
[01:41:57.201 --> 01:42:07.131]  And then you have this whole discussion on the repeal of the Posta Comitatus Act, which may sound very technical, but the Posta Comitatus Act, which was passed after the U.S.
[01:42:07.171 --> 01:42:12.736]  Civil War, the American Civil War, was a particular piece of legislation... 1876!
[01:42:13.377 --> 01:42:13.957]  Yeah, 1876.
[01:42:14.438 --> 01:42:18.702]  It prevents the military from entering into the realm of
[01:42:19.406 --> 01:42:22.929]  Uh, domestic, uh, judiciary and police.
[01:42:23.230 --> 01:42:25.051]  But in effect, they're doing it already.
[01:42:25.112 --> 01:42:27.854]  They've, they've... Yeah, I mean, I interviewed JAG officers.
[01:42:27.894 --> 01:42:32.038]  They said Posse Comitatus already had holes you could drive a Mack truck through in, in 96.
[01:42:32.098 --> 01:42:33.800]  No, absolutely.
[01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:38.264]  Absolutely, but they still want to make sure that that act is repealed.
[01:42:39.769 --> 01:42:40.810]  I mean, here's an example.
[01:42:41.510 --> 01:43:08.712]  Bush now has this new Patriot Act, I call it 2.5, because they passed Part of 2 back in December, not the whole thing, but now they've got Patriot Act 2.5, and there's a lawsuit, you know, it's a gag order when they're investigating you, then there's a gag order on the ACLU lawsuit, so there are lawsuits involved, they've already implemented Patriot Act 2 and Patriot Act 2.5, but then they're saying, oh, we've got to pass it, so they want to simply
[01:43:08.732 --> 01:43:09.233]  Exactly.
[01:43:09.273 --> 01:43:10.977]  Because there won't be any more civilian courts.
[01:43:18.402 --> 01:43:20.983]  Well, let me bring this up and then we'll go to some calls, Professor.
[01:43:21.003 --> 01:43:22.183]  This is intriguing.
[01:43:22.263 --> 01:43:27.845]  Unfortunately, we'll have to say goodbye because I have a couple of meetings this afternoon.
[01:43:27.865 --> 01:43:29.986]  Okay, you've got to leave right now?
[01:43:30.386 --> 01:43:32.327]  Well, in the next 10-15 minutes.
[01:43:32.427 --> 01:43:33.227]  No, yeah, that's fine.
[01:43:33.247 --> 01:43:35.928]  We'll go ahead and take a few calls here in a second and then let you go at the end of the hour.
[01:43:35.948 --> 01:43:39.749]  Now, getting back to this, though, because this is important.
[01:43:40.329 --> 01:43:43.471]  I don't know if you hear American radio, U.S.
[01:43:43.511 --> 01:43:53.017]  radio up in Canada, but we have a bunch of national talk show hosts every day saying anyone that disagrees with the government is aiding terrorists and needs to be put in a forced labor camp.
[01:43:53.378 --> 01:43:54.138]  That's a quote.
[01:43:54.538 --> 01:43:56.019]  That's even on TV.
[01:43:56.139 --> 01:43:58.161]  MSNBC has a host that promotes that.
[01:43:58.801 --> 01:44:00.843]  My neighbors are starting to talk like this.
[01:44:01.823 --> 01:44:04.866]  And I mean, this is a dangerous climate, Professor.
[01:44:05.206 --> 01:44:08.428]  All these federally funded TV shows are promoting torture now.
[01:44:08.969 --> 01:44:11.711]  So, what's your response to what I just said?
[01:44:11.731 --> 01:44:25.881]  It sounds a bit like the Spanish Inquisition, actually, because they said... I remember that during the Spanish Inquisition, it was illegal to defend the heretics
[01:44:27.054 --> 01:44:42.587]  Because lawyers were immediately branded as terrorists, and anybody who was actually, you know, anybody who would say he was not a terrorist had to denounce five or six other people, okay?
[01:44:43.928 --> 01:44:53.036]  It really, there's a whole history, but the Spanish Inquisition is really the basis of this kind of consensus.
[01:44:55.437 --> 01:45:00.721]  It creates an atmosphere of fear and intimidation.
[01:45:01.042 --> 01:45:11.810]  You remember, that's in the British comic series Monty Python, they said, fear and surprise, fear and surprise, here comes the Spanish Inquisition.
[01:45:12.090 --> 01:45:13.611]  Well, we're in that kind of mode.
[01:45:14.896 --> 01:45:21.082]  We're creating a situation where people are terrified by possible terror alerts.
[01:45:21.523 --> 01:45:32.715]  They expect the state will protect them and then they will start, then they have a 1-800 number and they say, if there's anything fishy in your neighborhood, your neighbor isn't doing the right thing.
[01:45:33.976 --> 01:45:41.602]  And then of course there's no real terrorists to find, so then now Homeland Security and Public Service ads says, oh, we're now fighting crime.
[01:45:41.622 --> 01:45:46.285]  We're putting cameras up to fight crime, report crime, defend the homeland.
[01:45:46.306 --> 01:45:54.832]  So now there's this super national federal system running our local police, and now there's no real terrorists to find, so we're going to fight criminals.
[01:45:55.473 --> 01:46:02.118]  Well sure, and the irony of course is that the whole apparatus is under the
[01:46:02.859 --> 01:46:06.001]  At least as far as the Total Information Awareness Program is under.
[01:46:06.021 --> 01:46:07.122]  Under a convicted felon?
[01:46:07.502 --> 01:46:07.742]  Yeah.
[01:46:08.402 --> 01:46:21.110]  Admiral Poindexter has a criminal record and he's running the Big Brother Data Bank, which oversees 350 million people when there's only, you know, there's not more than 300 million people in America.
[01:46:21.130 --> 01:46:24.532]  I mean, they've got more data files than there are people.
[01:46:25.273 --> 01:46:28.194]  Let's go ahead and take a couple calls and we'll let you get out of here, Professor.
[01:46:28.234 --> 01:46:29.635]  We've got Paul Watson coming up.
[01:46:30.296 --> 01:46:31.496]  Heather in Colorado.
[01:46:31.536 --> 01:46:32.377]  Heather, you're on the air.
[01:46:33.194 --> 01:46:44.322]  Yeah, I wanted to comment on the question that you asked your guest regarding why the information concerning the torture photos and the Nick Berg video was presented at this moment.
[01:46:45.283 --> 01:46:52.968]  Well, I think that considering what the media does is that they give a moral ethical conflict to the people.
[01:46:53.008 --> 01:46:54.589]  They present this to the population.
[01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:59.973]  And then they give you an exception to the rule in order to manipulate
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:03.283]  Your moral values into accepting torture.
[01:47:03.303 --> 01:47:07.367]  Yeah, they bring the torture out, then they bring the burg out to legitimize it.
[01:47:07.907 --> 01:47:08.728]  Right, exactly.
[01:47:08.828 --> 01:47:16.535]  And even though it's like fake and it's staged, it's still... And to some people it might be other hidden messages within the video and everything.
[01:47:16.996 --> 01:47:19.158]  Well, let me bring this up to the professor.
[01:47:19.178 --> 01:47:21.180]  Yeah, no, I think you're absolutely right.
[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:25.224]  What is happening now, it's a terrifying process.
[01:47:25.885 --> 01:47:40.772]  Is that public opinion, even going through this very biased media of CNN and NBC and CBS, OK, but particularly CNN, we see the images of the war and the killings and so on.
[01:47:40.792 --> 01:47:41.773]  We have the reports.
[01:47:42.173 --> 01:47:43.534]  We can read between the lines.
[01:47:44.034 --> 01:47:49.717]  And the propaganda process now is telling us, well, nothing here, folks.
[01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:52.095]  Uh, these people are evil.
[01:47:52.195 --> 01:47:53.217]  We have to kill them.
[01:47:53.799 --> 01:47:56.285]  And because if we don't kill them, they'll kill us.
[01:47:56.946 --> 01:47:59.492]  And, uh, then they start saying, well it's all...
[01:48:00.251 --> 01:48:05.593]  Connected to 9-11, and these people are attacking America, and so on and so forth.
[01:48:05.894 --> 01:48:12.456]  So that, in effect, what's happening is a propaganda campaign, which is there to give a human face to torture.
[01:48:12.757 --> 01:48:15.118]  They don't call it torture, they call it prison abuse.
[01:48:15.498 --> 01:48:18.059]  They don't give it any historical perspective.
[01:48:18.239 --> 01:48:22.501]  Riping women and beating people to death is torture.
[01:48:23.061 --> 01:48:25.042]  The most severe forms of it.
[01:48:26.406 --> 01:48:27.067]  Absolutely.
[01:48:27.147 --> 01:48:29.789]  And so they're bringing out this debate, legitimizing it.
[01:48:29.829 --> 01:48:31.110]  Real quick, anything else, Scholar?
[01:48:32.491 --> 01:48:33.072]  No, thank you.
[01:48:33.092 --> 01:48:34.873]  I just wanted to comment on your question.
[01:48:35.054 --> 01:48:36.535]  Alright, well a great point that you made.
[01:48:36.575 --> 01:48:37.356]  I totally agree with you.
[01:48:37.816 --> 01:48:39.417]  Let's talk to Paul in Florida.
[01:48:39.437 --> 01:48:40.038]  Paul, go ahead.
[01:48:40.058 --> 01:48:41.980]  You're on the air with Professor Chosodosky.
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:43.421]  Yes, Alex.
[01:48:43.781 --> 01:48:49.406]  I'm a long time listener and I wanted to give you a heads up right now.
[01:48:49.566 --> 01:48:52.829]  I just cleared an area outside of Birmingham.
[01:48:53.314 --> 01:48:55.414]  I'm driving back to Florida on Highway 65.
[01:48:55.715 --> 01:49:00.836]  They shut down 65 at Highway 31.
[01:49:01.596 --> 01:49:14.418]  And there's a Fox News truck that was there with a Scopeway in the air, but Homeland Security, the Secret Service, the Alabama Bomb Squad had a big truck.
[01:49:14.879 --> 01:49:16.519]  Are they running some type of drill?
[01:49:16.999 --> 01:49:18.059]  No, it's not a drill.
[01:49:18.159 --> 01:49:21.680]  There's an 18-wheeler with its hood up.
[01:49:22.185 --> 01:49:26.926]  It's got a blue container on the back of it that they're investigating.
[01:49:27.546 --> 01:49:34.868]  They've cleared about... Well, you say it's not a drill, and I've been to 50 of these drills where they do just this and then never tell anybody it's a drill.
[01:49:35.208 --> 01:49:37.969]  All part of heightening the subconscious fear.
[01:49:38.189 --> 01:49:46.771]  Yeah, well, it could be that, Alex, but I'm telling you that they've got a very big area in North Birmingham shut down right now.
[01:49:48.001 --> 01:49:56.365]  Well, regarding the information that you're talking about right now, I think this could be another ploy right into it.
[01:49:57.146 --> 01:50:04.029]  I think that the hype and the fear that they're spreading is doing that to try to weaken us.
[01:50:04.856 --> 01:50:06.178]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[01:50:06.578 --> 01:50:07.900]  Professor, any final comments?
[01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:15.227]  Well, I mean, you know, this is the way people get intimidated into accepting the Big Brother mentality.
[01:50:15.888 --> 01:50:21.574]  They have roadblocks, they have terror alerts, they go around with helicopters.
[01:50:21.614 --> 01:50:25.699]  They did it last Christmas, and those terror alerts were fabricated.
[01:50:25.759 --> 01:50:26.780]  I mean, it was
[01:50:27.847 --> 01:50:33.750]  They revealed that they knew right at Christmas that the terror alerts were fabricated.
[01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:35.831]  And they said it's going to continue through New Year's.
[01:50:36.231 --> 01:50:37.212]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:50:37.312 --> 01:50:43.274]  And the French police authorities had proven that they were fabricated and they were fabricated by the CIA.
[01:50:43.975 --> 01:50:48.577]  Well, two years ago the CIA and FBI came out and said we've been ordered to issue fake terror alerts.
[01:50:48.977 --> 01:50:50.238]  Thanks for joining us, Professor.
[01:50:50.298 --> 01:50:50.718]  God bless.
[01:50:55.316 --> 01:50:55.657]  I think so.
[01:51:10.558 --> 01:51:11.219]  We're good to go!
[01:51:40.077 --> 01:51:43.178]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:51:43.338 --> 01:51:49.299]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:51:52.860 --> 01:51:57.201]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:51:57.361 --> 01:52:01.742]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:52:04.497 --> 01:52:06.338]  This disaster is a new world order.
[01:52:06.419 --> 01:52:08.881]  A new world order can emerge.
[01:52:09.501 --> 01:52:13.704]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:52:13.785 --> 01:52:20.710]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:52:20.850 --> 01:52:22.852]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:52:23.092 --> 01:52:33.559]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:52:33.839 --> 01:52:39.203]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:52:52.316 --> 01:52:58.557]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:52:58.697 --> 01:53:04.858]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:53:05.138 --> 01:53:13.580]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:20.841]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:53:21.161 --> 01:53:25.964]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:53:26.184 --> 01:53:31.588]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:53:31.928 --> 01:53:35.010]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.

[01:54:02.725 --> 01:54:05.046]  We're just trying to get you to think, my friends.
[01:54:06.906 --> 01:54:12.128]  Paul Watson's coming up and we'll get into Bush's speech and the latest Berg developments, you name it.
[01:54:12.969 --> 01:54:16.970]  Before I go to Paula and Joe and others that are patiently holding them,
[01:54:18.524 --> 01:54:25.146]  I want to encourage you to get 9-11 The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror, two videos I've made covering September 11th.
[01:54:26.727 --> 01:54:36.470]  I want you to get them, I want you to make ten copies of them, it's very easy to do, and get them out to opinion makers, public officials, your friends, your family, your pastor.
[01:54:38.111 --> 01:54:46.774]  There's a book I've written on 9-11, 9-11 The Sentence of Tyranny, Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and The New World Order, that I published.
[01:54:48.522 --> 01:54:51.885]  There are so many great books and videos that we've produced.
[01:54:52.085 --> 01:54:54.527]  There's other great videos and books that we carry.

[01:55:42.761 --> 01:55:47.926]  And I want to thank all of you that have gotten the films, that have made copies, that have educated people.
[01:55:48.827 --> 01:55:51.470]  I know it's had a massive global effect.
[01:55:52.509 --> 01:55:53.710]  And I want to commend you.
[01:55:54.330 --> 01:56:02.914]  We've already saved a lot of lives just here in America, exposing the globalists in their lies.
[01:56:03.574 --> 01:56:06.155]  We have already saved so many lives.
[01:56:06.975 --> 01:56:17.720]  But we've got to expose that the globalists are deceiving us, that they are putting out propaganda, that their official story around 9-11 is a fraud, is a lie, is a scam!
[01:56:21.877 --> 01:56:24.318]  I mean, just their official story is impossible.
[01:56:24.418 --> 01:56:26.139]  And then we have the facts of who's behind it.
[01:56:26.459 --> 01:56:27.099]  Official U.S.
[01:56:27.139 --> 01:56:28.920]  government plans to carry out terror attacks.
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:32.201]  That's why Eric Huffman's video and DVD I carry is great.
[01:56:32.221 --> 01:56:32.661]  His book.
[01:56:33.101 --> 01:56:34.082]  Paul Watson's book.
[01:56:34.842 --> 01:56:36.143]  We're trying to save lives here.
[01:56:36.623 --> 01:56:38.564]  And if we don't, they're going to blow more stuff up.
[01:56:38.604 --> 01:56:39.364]  They said they're going to do it.
[01:56:39.804 --> 01:56:41.185]  Alright, let's go ahead and take calls.
[01:56:41.285 --> 01:56:41.785]  Paula.
[01:56:42.285 --> 01:56:43.285]  Paula in Missouri.
[01:56:43.305 --> 01:56:43.906]  You're on the air.
[01:56:43.926 --> 01:56:44.526]  Thanks for holding.
[01:56:45.486 --> 01:56:46.327]  Hi, Alec.
[01:56:46.707 --> 01:56:47.147]  How you doing?
[01:56:48.301 --> 01:56:49.882]  I was so glad you had the professor on.
[01:56:49.922 --> 01:56:53.925]  I was hoping, I wanted to ask him a question in reference to John Necroponte.
[01:56:54.426 --> 01:56:55.247]  Yeah, he had to go.
[01:56:55.267 --> 01:56:56.307]  He had to go teach a class.
[01:56:56.588 --> 01:57:00.111]  If he would be the, if he thought that he would be the next viceroy of Iraq.
[01:57:00.471 --> 01:57:13.122]  Well no, that's, look, they're claiming there's no longer going to be a governor because we are appointing a new committee, but there's going to be this 3,000 man base, the same one that's the governorship now, run by the U.S.
[01:57:13.242 --> 01:57:14.483]  Ambassador Necroponte.
[01:57:14.523 --> 01:57:15.864]  So yes, he is the governor.
[01:57:16.304 --> 01:57:16.604]  Wow.
[01:57:16.984 --> 01:57:26.008]  Okay, now my thought on Rumsfeld going to Iraq for that one day, that surprise visit, I believe that Rumsfeld went there to tell those people to shut up and to stop showing those pictures.
[01:57:27.288 --> 01:57:30.910]  And on the... Well, they admit that they've... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:57:30.990 --> 01:57:31.850]  And then one more thing.
[01:57:32.670 --> 01:57:34.111]  You were also talking about the occult.
[01:57:34.191 --> 01:57:39.353]  On Gematria, that's what numerology is considered in the occult.
[01:57:39.773 --> 01:57:44.655]  And number nine, I remember someone calling and saying, well I had looked this up too,
[01:57:45.097 --> 01:57:49.880]  But there were 911 days from the bombing of the trains in Spain from 9-11-01.
[01:57:49.920 --> 01:57:53.902]  And also... And, but it just wasn't 911 days from 9-11, it was also on 3-11.
[01:57:54.002 --> 01:57:54.202]  Right.
[01:57:54.242 --> 01:57:54.402]  Yes.
[01:57:54.422 --> 01:57:57.864]  And also now, John, September 11th of 2001 to June 6th of 2004 is 999 days, Alex.
[01:57:57.884 --> 01:58:02.587]  Number 9 means completion in their numbers.
[01:58:14.967 --> 01:58:16.408]  I know, they're totally obsessed with it.
[01:58:16.468 --> 01:58:18.909]  I mean, we don't believe in all of this, but they really do.
[01:58:18.929 --> 01:58:20.470]  I mean, how many presidents have you heard of?
[01:58:20.510 --> 01:58:26.612]  All the psychics in there, and the people of numerology making decisions, you know, Clinton, Ronald Reagan.
[01:58:27.053 --> 01:58:27.713]  Thanks for the call.
[01:58:28.373 --> 01:58:29.514]  And I've been to Bohemian Grove.
[01:58:29.534 --> 01:58:30.234]  They're into the occult.
[01:58:30.294 --> 01:58:31.235]  I mean, they believe in this.
[01:58:31.275 --> 01:58:32.175]  You cannot ignore it.
[01:58:33.256 --> 01:58:39.198]  Third hour coming up, Paul Watson, Warrior Calls, and a bunch of news we haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:58:39.258 --> 01:58:40.039]  You don't want to miss it.
[01:58:40.059 --> 01:58:40.479]  Stay with us.
[01:58:44.159 --> 01:58:54.881]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:58:55.062 --> 01:59:02.643]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:59:02.883 --> 01:59:06.044]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:59:06.304 --> 01:59:12.070]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:59:12.351 --> 01:59:18.517]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:59:18.858 --> 01:59:22.762]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:59:22.802 --> 01:59:24.684]  The water level is always visible.
[01:59:24.864 --> 01:59:30.829]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.

[01:59:53.298 --> 01:59:54.418]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:55.058 --> 01:59:55.878]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.638 --> 01:59:57.519]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:58.199 --> 02:00:01.920]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.380 --> 02:00:06.501]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:11.842 --> 02:00:15.282]  Alright, already into our number three.
[02:00:16.883 --> 02:00:17.883]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:00:19.281 --> 02:00:23.464]  We're now joined by a man who does a lot of great work for us.
[02:00:23.544 --> 02:00:25.666]  Runs PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.
[02:00:26.366 --> 02:00:28.187]  Well, my wife runs Infowars.com.
[02:00:28.228 --> 02:00:32.130]  Paul runs PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv for us.
[02:00:32.731 --> 02:00:34.072]  And he's a great researcher.
[02:00:34.692 --> 02:00:39.396]  He has written a book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and the New World Order.
[02:00:39.416 --> 02:00:44.179]  We're going to take a lot of calls this hour and go through a whole plethora of really important news.
[02:00:44.199 --> 02:00:44.259]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:00:48.942 --> 02:00:52.584]  Paul, what's on the front burner today?
[02:00:52.644 --> 02:00:53.985]  What do you think is most important?
[02:00:54.025 --> 02:00:56.567]  What will we be covering in the next 58 minutes?
[02:00:57.527 --> 02:01:14.317]  Well, as far as I'm concerned, I mean, the floor's open for the cause, but definitely we need to go in depth on this new Berg evidence as it relates to the possible similarities between the Berg video and the Abu Ghraib torture videos, because there's a lot of new evidence on that.
[02:01:15.259 --> 02:01:33.573]  Well, I mean, we always have the white chair that looks the same, the weird brown cream walls, you know, his CIA connections, working with Iraqis who work for the State Department, working with, you know, being around hijackers, working at the prison, but now we've got top forensic heads of universities in the U.S.
[02:01:33.593 --> 02:01:37.816]  and Australia and others saying this thing's an obvious fake, the video itself!
[02:01:38.356 --> 02:01:40.858]  And that's just the forensics evidence!
[02:01:42.039 --> 02:01:44.461]  Well, it's interesting you mention their CIA connections.
[02:01:45.109 --> 02:01:55.442]  There was actually a London Times article on Sunday which covered most of the things that we brought up in the past two weeks and circulated without giving us any credit, of course, as they always don't.
[02:01:56.143 --> 02:02:01.870]  But I mentioned that, and I think the quote was something like, many people have postulated that because
[02:02:02.725 --> 02:02:13.191]  Berg had connections to Al-Qaeda members, or supposed Al-Qaeda members, that he is then, according to the hypothesis, connected to the CIA.
[02:02:13.571 --> 02:02:20.235]  So there you have the London Times itself making the connection between Al-Qaeda and the CIA in one sentence.
[02:02:20.814 --> 02:02:27.937]  But this new piece of evidence has been circulating around the internet for a few days, and as yet it's unconfirmed.
[02:02:27.977 --> 02:02:31.599]  And I suppose, you know, a call to Kodak would probably confirm it.
[02:02:31.639 --> 02:02:40.103]  But numerous people are looking at the digital watermarks, which are not visible to the naked eye on the videos.
[02:02:40.143 --> 02:02:42.644]  It's on the actual, you know, the surface of the tape.
[02:02:43.284 --> 02:02:51.611]  On both the Abu Ghraib video released by the Washington Post on Friday and the Nick Berg execution video.
[02:02:52.171 --> 02:02:56.034]  And saying that basically the codings are exactly the same.
[02:02:57.063 --> 02:03:04.127]  And apparently Kodak have undertaken the analysis and are set to release it to the major media in the next few days.
[02:03:04.688 --> 02:03:07.289]  So whether that happens remains to be seen.
[02:03:07.789 --> 02:03:14.573]  But as you mentioned, the previous evidence that we discussed does indeed point to the same hypothesis.
[02:03:14.834 --> 02:03:18.536]  We know that Berg worked at Abu Ghraib prison.
[02:03:19.216 --> 02:03:24.218]  Before his capture, he was wearing the orange jumpsuit that we see in the video.
[02:03:24.658 --> 02:03:34.242]  And again, with those new photos released on Friday by the Washington Post, we have a picture of one of the Iraqi detainees there in the exact same orange jumpsuit.
[02:03:35.942 --> 02:03:42.025]  As you said, the standard issue white chairs are seen in both the torture footage and the burg footage.
[02:03:42.965 --> 02:03:47.787]  And another thing which got picked up by the London Times on Sunday in the same article
[02:03:48.536 --> 02:03:56.685]  is that several frames in the Berg video suggest military personnel on the set of the filming.
[02:03:57.486 --> 02:04:01.589]  Now that, again, isn't conclusive either way, but it certainly, you know, it fits the pattern.
[02:04:02.309 --> 02:04:11.656]  And of course, the Western voices on the end of the tape saying, that I will be done, or other people, you know, postulate that it says, this is how it will be done.
[02:04:12.116 --> 02:04:13.557]  And it sounds more like that to me.
[02:04:13.717 --> 02:04:21.422]  So it's, you know, it's as if someone is directing them when they go ahead and decapitate what's looking more and more like a mannequin.
[02:04:22.063 --> 02:04:23.784]  And we'll get into the rest after the break.
[02:04:25.549 --> 02:04:28.252]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, after this quick break.
[02:04:29.172 --> 02:04:31.615]  They never show you evidence, just some foggy illusion.
[02:04:32.436 --> 02:04:35.979]  This is a government that's been caught giving you fake Fat Bin Laden tapes.
[02:04:36.519 --> 02:04:38.201]  Fake weapons dossiers.
[02:04:39.062 --> 02:04:40.163]  Fake newscasts.
[02:04:40.803 --> 02:04:42.165]  Oh, but they wouldn't do this.
[02:04:45.774 --> 02:04:54.200]  Folks, the future of gardening is upon us, and whether you grow for fun, food, or profit, you'll discover great new ways to reap more rewards from everything you grow at futuregarden.com.

[02:05:48.467 --> 02:05:51.252]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:05:51.512 --> 02:05:55.678]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:05:56.099 --> 02:05:56.940]  So what do you do?
[02:05:57.241 --> 02:06:01.828]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:06:02.304 --> 02:06:04.425]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:06:44.918 --> 02:06:46.438]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:06:46.638 --> 02:06:49.719]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:06:49.859 --> 02:06:53.740]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:06:53.800 --> 02:06:58.021]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:06:58.381 --> 02:07:02.142]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:07:02.302 --> 02:07:04.143]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:07:04.303 --> 02:07:07.604]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[02:07:07.644 --> 02:07:08.724]  The medical bills!
[02:07:09.564 --> 02:07:12.365]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:07:12.505 --> 02:07:15.546]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:07:15.726 --> 02:07:18.607]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:07:19.067 --> 02:07:25.189]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:07:25.729 --> 02:07:29.534]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:07:53.466 --> 02:07:54.687]  Government cover-ups.
[02:07:55.227 --> 02:07:56.047]  You want answers?
[02:07:56.808 --> 02:07:57.688]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:57.708 --> 02:08:02.170]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:02.550 --> 02:08:06.652]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:07.692 --> 02:08:14.956]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2, Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight Central.
[02:08:15.056 --> 02:08:17.517]  Again, thanks for joining us.
[02:08:17.737 --> 02:08:21.179]  Paul Watson, before we get into the latest Berg
[02:08:37.014 --> 02:08:37.455]  I think so.
[02:08:52.332 --> 02:08:54.333]  Well, again, we've been saying for many months
[02:09:19.768 --> 02:09:21.489]  I think we just lost Paul.
[02:09:21.569 --> 02:09:22.969]  Is he still there now?
[02:09:47.535 --> 02:09:48.636]  His phone dropped.
[02:09:48.956 --> 02:09:51.017]  Ah, over in England that happens occasionally.
[02:09:51.037 --> 02:09:51.997]  I'll tell you what we'll do.
[02:09:52.058 --> 02:09:53.898]  Let's bring Debbie Maher up for about four minutes.
[02:09:53.919 --> 02:09:54.979]  We'll get Paul back on.
[02:09:55.399 --> 02:09:58.321]  Then we'll finish up with those comments and go right into your calls, folks.
[02:09:58.721 --> 02:09:59.962]  For those that are patiently holding.
[02:10:00.682 --> 02:10:02.923]  Debbie, joining us from New Millennium Concepts.
[02:10:02.943 --> 02:10:04.564]  I'll have to get you up a couple times a week.
[02:10:05.565 --> 02:10:07.606]  We're talking about clean water here.
[02:10:07.626 --> 02:10:11.888]  I mean, look, you should get a big Berkey just because it's high quality water.
[02:10:12.288 --> 02:10:14.970]  Some of the best water you can get at one of the lowest prices.
[02:10:15.797 --> 02:10:18.821]  But at the same time, the government's saying we will be attacked.
[02:10:19.201 --> 02:10:20.884]  Massive attacks all over the country.
[02:10:21.284 --> 02:10:27.071]  Well, if that's the case, regardless of who's behind it, we need to have clean water for our families.
[02:10:27.532 --> 02:10:29.735]  You can live without food for a month.
[02:10:30.413 --> 02:10:33.334]  But you cannot live without water more than three or four days.
[02:10:33.974 --> 02:10:37.695]  And you can put pond water, lake water, puddle water into this.
[02:10:37.736 --> 02:10:40.416]  It'll do thousands and thousands and thousands of gallons.
[02:10:40.817 --> 02:10:42.037]  No moving parts, folks.
[02:10:42.077 --> 02:10:44.818]  It's gravity-fed, high-quality, made in America.
[02:10:45.138 --> 02:10:46.478]  Debbie, good to have you on the show with us.
[02:10:46.799 --> 02:10:48.899]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:10:48.939 --> 02:10:53.461]  Tell folks about the Berkey Light, how it works, and some of the specials you've got and how they can get it.
[02:10:54.161 --> 02:10:54.521]  Okay.
[02:10:54.621 --> 02:10:58.342]  The Berkey Light is a two-and-a-half gallon gravity-fed water filter.
[02:10:58.362 --> 02:10:59.783]  You pour the water in the top.
[02:11:00.526 --> 02:11:12.558]  The water seeps down through the filters and drips into the bottom canister and then you have a spigot and you take your water out through the spigot, you know, by using a cup or a pitcher, however you want.
[02:11:12.858 --> 02:11:17.002]  You can call us to order it and we have two specials.
[02:11:17.443 --> 02:11:19.365]  We have the Berkey Light
[02:11:20.137 --> 02:11:24.139]  Without the light, which the lights are just an option.
[02:11:24.219 --> 02:11:27.781]  They don't have anything to do with filtering the water.
[02:11:28.341 --> 02:11:35.025]  The lights allow you to have a light if your power goes out for whatever reason.
[02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:40.267]  And they come with rechargeable batteries, but you can get the system with or without light.
[02:11:40.608 --> 02:11:46.296]  By the way, those are 14-year continuous burn LED array lights up a room.
[02:11:46.317 --> 02:11:47.258]  You can read by it.
[02:11:48.079 --> 02:11:48.921]  Great system.
[02:11:49.161 --> 02:11:50.363]  Goes into the base of it.
[02:11:51.130 --> 02:11:57.294]  And it's about a foot and a half tall system that you put the water into.
[02:11:57.694 --> 02:12:00.316]  And this is a purifier, not just a filter.
[02:12:00.916 --> 02:12:02.177]  And it's made in America.
[02:12:02.517 --> 02:12:04.779]  And to buy something comparable is over $300.
[02:12:05.579 --> 02:12:09.342]  And you'll save money just in the first few months not buying bottled water.
[02:12:09.562 --> 02:12:13.044]  And on top of it, bottled water has been proven to be just about as bad as tap water, Debbie.
[02:12:13.344 --> 02:12:14.245]  Yes, that's correct.
[02:12:14.325 --> 02:12:16.106]  In fact, I've had recalls on water.
[02:12:16.946 --> 02:12:18.868]  And, you know, just different things, you know.
[02:12:20.279 --> 02:12:29.302]  I'm amazed sometimes at how people think that demineralized water, you know, there's a lot of people, there's a lot of different opinion of demineralized water or mineralized water.
[02:12:29.322 --> 02:12:36.825]  Arbor key filters do leave the beneficial minerals into the water which keeps your body healthier.
[02:12:36.845 --> 02:12:49.709]  It allows you to keep your bones whereas demineralized water acts as a solvent and it depletes your system of the beneficial minerals you need and your bones become more and more brittle over time.
[02:12:50.231 --> 02:13:03.971]  A lot of times when you find out that a friend or a relative has osteoporosis starting, if you ask them what kind of water they drink, many, many times they say, oh, I drink reverse osmosis or I drink distilled.
[02:13:06.149 --> 02:13:08.251]  We have a big murky and we have reverse osmosis.
[02:13:08.311 --> 02:13:12.674]  As long as you're getting some of the mineralized water, you're okay.
[02:13:12.694 --> 02:13:27.705]  Now you've got the $1.99 special where you get a free gift, the Sheltering in Place video or the Prudent Places CD with the hundreds of color maps and demographics and regions and it's really something everybody should have.
[02:13:28.406 --> 02:13:35.010]  You also have the special though still, don't you, where you get five sport bottle murky filters that are portable for $100.
[02:13:36.212 --> 02:13:36.632]  Yes, we do.
[02:13:55.013 --> 02:13:58.995]  And if you call and it's busy, just leave her name and number, she'll call you right back.
[02:13:59.015 --> 02:14:01.037]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:14:02.598 --> 02:14:10.842]  And if people just want the Sheltering in Place video, or the Prudent Places CD, if you've already got a Berkey Light, you can call and get that as well.
[02:14:11.262 --> 02:14:20.568]  So again, 1-888-803-4438, or berkeywater.com, but tell them in the comment section that you heard it from Alex Jones to get the special,
[02:14:21.088 --> 02:14:22.550]  And tell them what free gift you want.
[02:14:22.810 --> 02:14:26.353]  Berkeywater.com or Infowars.com.
[02:14:26.673 --> 02:14:29.196]  Again, that's 888-803-4438.
[02:14:29.756 --> 02:14:30.457]  Anything else, Debbie?
[02:14:30.737 --> 02:14:31.678]  Nope, that'll do.
[02:14:32.158 --> 02:14:32.999]  Thanks for coming on.
[02:14:33.439 --> 02:14:34.100]  I appreciate it.
[02:14:35.241 --> 02:14:36.242]  Did we ever get Paul back?
[02:14:37.142 --> 02:14:37.842]  Yeah, he's back.
[02:14:37.922 --> 02:14:38.222]  Good.
[02:14:38.302 --> 02:14:43.004]  Paul Watson got cut off in the middle of that, and we had Debbie waiting in the wings to join us.
[02:14:43.064 --> 02:14:52.147]  And then I want to go to some calls here in a minute, but continuing with Chalibi, I did get the AP article a listener mentioned yesterday, where he said, oh, this gives me a badge of honor.
[02:14:52.487 --> 02:14:53.667]  Shows I'm independent.
[02:14:53.947 --> 02:14:56.148]  They came to his compound and took a computer.
[02:14:56.168 --> 02:14:57.808]  I mean, this is nothing but theater.
[02:14:57.848 --> 02:15:00.349]  I mean, this guy was at the State of the Union address.
[02:15:00.369 --> 02:15:02.690]  He's the darling of the CIA, Paul.
[02:15:03.447 --> 02:15:11.570]  Well, and it was his so-called intelligence that, you know, formed the front page of the New York Times for six months about all this phony intelligence and why we should go to war.
[02:15:12.250 --> 02:15:32.817]  But, um, yeah, he's supposedly going to defect to the other side and play the good cop, um, just before the UN come in, but alongside this, we've got, um, the report where the Pentagon and the State Department are going to go ahead and set up this 75,000 member international peacekeeping force, which is called
[02:15:33.477 --> 02:15:39.981]  Global Peace Operations Initiative, which is basically going to be under the auspices of the UN.
[02:15:40.021 --> 02:15:43.563]  So that's in collusion with the Pentagon and the State Department.
[02:15:43.583 --> 02:15:47.485]  So here's Bush bolstering and expanding the role of the UN.
[02:15:48.245 --> 02:15:50.607]  Yeah, they'll go in after each invasion.
[02:15:51.207 --> 02:15:59.652]  And it has to be remembered that in the first place, and Bush continually cites this in almost every speech he gives, is that he went to war
[02:16:00.790 --> 02:16:05.831]  With Iraq, based on, you know, citing UN Security Council resolutions.
[02:16:05.871 --> 02:16:17.693]  He says it time and time again, so the contention that the UN didn't authorize this war goes against, you know, their own resolutions, which gave Bush the pretext to cite them as a reason for going to war.
[02:16:18.294 --> 02:16:30.136]  So now they're rolling out this global peace force, 75,000 members in line with the Pentagon and the State Department, and, you know, these are going to form the backbone of the troops that then go into the occupied countries.
[02:16:32.760 --> 02:16:35.324]  And now, we didn't go in for weapons of mass destruction.
[02:16:35.364 --> 02:16:37.046]  Rumsfeld says they never said that.
[02:16:37.066 --> 02:16:41.192]  It's an urban legend, though he was on TV hundreds of times saying it with the rest of the administration.
[02:16:41.593 --> 02:16:42.915]  Now it's to stop torture.
[02:16:43.255 --> 02:16:45.258]  But when we do torture, it's suddenly good.
[02:16:46.457 --> 02:16:57.240]  Well, yeah, they're running out of excuses, really, because, um, you know, the only weapons of mass destruction, there were actually weapons of mass destruction found, but it turned out that they were, um, in Alabama.
[02:16:57.501 --> 02:17:14.766]  So, that was the only story of that nature, apart from these mythical, um, ghosts like, you know, bioweapons trucks and exploded serine shells, which then, the photographs show the inspectors, you know, opening up and sniffing with no protective gear or anything, so, must be highly dangerous stuff.
[02:17:15.558 --> 02:17:31.321]  The report now is that they're going to go ahead and get rid of Sanchez, the military commander, who according to our information is one of many heads that are going to roll over the next few weeks and we're actually going to put a special report on PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:17:32.939 --> 02:17:37.646]  Later today or tomorrow about that for subscribers and it's kind of the inside scoop.
[02:17:38.127 --> 02:17:47.422]  So they're getting rid of a lot of the military commanders now and phasing in a new legion of them along with this new peacekeeping force in line with the UN.
[02:17:49.568 --> 02:18:05.173]  It's incredible, and I'm sure you heard about Richard Grasso, Dick Grasso, with his $200 million payout, and we have Spitzer, and his 54-page lawsuit filed Monday makes Richard Grasso look more like a mafia boss than the head of the world's largest stock exchange.
[02:18:05.193 --> 02:18:15.756]  I just want to point out that the entire government and these so-called quasi-governmental agencies and private groups like the New York Stock Exchange are just looting the entire economy.
[02:18:17.282 --> 02:18:20.583]  Well yeah, how many trillion was it missing from the Pentagon?
[02:18:20.603 --> 02:18:21.443]  1.2 trillion.
[02:18:22.543 --> 02:18:34.226]  And it's a minor footnote, a trillion bucks, with some loose change, 200 billion missing, and the average person has no idea, even though it's admitted by the government itself, Paul.
[02:18:34.447 --> 02:18:39.968]  What about the CIA chief pays secret visit to Qatar to silence Al Jazeera?
[02:18:41.616 --> 02:18:42.557]  Well, that's interesting.
[02:18:42.617 --> 02:18:45.939]  A report that Tenet paid a secret visit over there.
[02:18:46.339 --> 02:18:52.143]  Apparently they're unhappy with the government of Qatar, as Americans call it.
[02:18:53.244 --> 02:18:54.585]  Fox News created that.
[02:18:54.605 --> 02:18:57.027]  I think it's actually pronounced Qatar, or it is in your country.
[02:18:57.047 --> 02:18:57.627]  Yeah, Qatar, yeah.
[02:18:58.128 --> 02:19:01.210]  But Fox News, you know, created that name for it, and everyone says it now.
[02:19:01.886 --> 02:19:10.594]  Apparently he went over there because they're not happy with their government allowing Al Jazeera to report uncensored on torture and many other issues.
[02:19:10.654 --> 02:19:13.116]  Now, there's two perspectives on this.
[02:19:13.136 --> 02:19:24.947]  Some people say that because Al Jazeera is based in that country, which is obviously on the surface loyal to the US occupational government, that Al Jazeera is, you know, some kind of steam valve that they use to release information.
[02:19:25.447 --> 02:19:26.048]  I don't think so.
[02:19:46.334 --> 02:19:49.895]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[02:19:50.215 --> 02:19:50.555]  Yes.
[02:19:50.835 --> 02:19:53.216]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood.
[02:19:53.476 --> 02:19:55.637]  The richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[02:19:55.757 --> 02:20:04.680]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, 2 ounces of juice have the same nutrition as 3 pounds of choice garden produce.
[02:20:04.840 --> 02:20:12.542]  The get-up-and-go energy, healing, blood building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.
[02:20:12.762 --> 02:20:14.983]  Hi, I'm Allen Davison at Monocot Wheatgrass.

[02:20:45.345 --> 02:20:46.946]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.

[02:20:58.776 --> 02:21:08.063]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:21:08.403 --> 02:21:13.369]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:21:13.689 --> 02:21:17.714]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.

[02:21:45.293 --> 02:21:50.015]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[02:21:50.235 --> 02:21:53.677]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[02:21:53.897 --> 02:21:56.358]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[02:21:56.598 --> 02:22:05.202]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[02:22:05.562 --> 02:22:11.325]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[02:22:11.605 --> 02:22:13.547]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.

[02:22:45.252 --> 02:22:46.913]  Is the air you breathe killing you?
[02:22:47.513 --> 02:22:47.813]  What?
[02:22:47.913 --> 02:22:54.056]  The Environmental Protection Agency studies state that indoor air is up to 70 times more polluted than outdoor city air.
[02:22:54.397 --> 02:22:56.277]  Even Oprah addressed this concern on her show.
[02:22:56.618 --> 02:22:57.058]  Heard enough?
[02:22:57.685 --> 02:22:58.326]  Sure have!
[02:22:58.566 --> 02:23:00.088]  How can I purify my air?
[02:23:00.348 --> 02:23:00.609]  Easy.

[02:24:04.416 --> 02:24:06.298]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[02:24:06.318 --> 02:24:11.162]  We've got about 35 minutes left of this global transmission against tyranny.
[02:24:11.182 --> 02:24:14.044]  A bunch of other key news coming up in the next segment.
[02:24:14.424 --> 02:24:16.226]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[02:24:16.726 --> 02:24:18.187]  DJ, you're on the air.
[02:24:18.227 --> 02:24:19.168]  Where are you calling us from?
[02:24:19.188 --> 02:24:20.709]  Illinois.
[02:24:21.050 --> 02:24:21.410]  Welcome.
[02:24:21.810 --> 02:24:22.231]  How are you?
[02:24:22.631 --> 02:24:22.891]  Fine.
[02:24:23.972 --> 02:24:24.733]  Okay.
[02:24:24.753 --> 02:24:27.675]  A couple of things that I came across on C-SPAN.
[02:24:28.656 --> 02:24:30.377]  I didn't have the tape, but there's some of it.
[02:24:31.345 --> 02:24:33.486]  The other one, I might have it on tape someplace.
[02:24:33.986 --> 02:24:42.070]  Anyway, within the last two days, I believe, Senator Durbin from Chicago was talking about a safety bill.
[02:24:43.630 --> 02:24:44.971]  Anybody know anything about that?
[02:24:46.171 --> 02:24:50.793]  And I also want to know... Well, what was he saying was in the quote, safety bill?
[02:24:51.454 --> 02:24:52.694]  He did not specify.
[02:24:54.035 --> 02:24:56.716]  Okay, what else?
[02:24:57.376 --> 02:25:00.938]  Okay, I think, isn't he a CFR member?
[02:25:02.407 --> 02:25:03.047]  I believe so.
[02:25:03.067 --> 02:25:04.408]  I'm fairly sure he is.
[02:25:04.908 --> 02:25:15.212]  Also, he was questioning, this was a committee meeting, on General Myers, or questioning General Myers on the turnover in Iraq?
[02:25:15.633 --> 02:25:15.933]  Yes.
[02:25:16.293 --> 02:25:16.553]  Okay.
[02:25:18.414 --> 02:25:28.598]  Durbin was among those who were bringing up questions on abuses of the Patriot Act on citizens who, as they said, didn't even know they were being secretly surveilled.
[02:25:29.238 --> 02:25:30.739]  Now, after this,
[02:25:32.048 --> 02:25:48.735]  Just before it closed, Orrin Hatch, Mr. Hatchett, said that absolutely no one could give one instance of abuse... Yeah, that's one of their favorite... These neocons say this, and then no one challenges it.
[02:25:49.316 --> 02:25:52.517]  This, okay, I'll give you... Well, supposedly... Hold on, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.
[02:25:53.057 --> 02:25:53.698]  You brought this up.
[02:25:53.738 --> 02:25:54.418]  Let me comment on it.
[02:25:55.774 --> 02:26:00.795]  They have used it on county commissioners, popless bars, pot dealers.
[02:26:01.696 --> 02:26:06.757]  About a year and a half ago, the Justice Department said they're going to use it for all crimes.
[02:26:07.317 --> 02:26:09.157]  State prosecutors have been using it.
[02:26:09.577 --> 02:26:18.239]  I mean, Paul Watson, we've probably seen, what, a hundred articles where they've been using the Patriot Act against the general public in non-terror related cases.
[02:26:20.260 --> 02:26:21.160]  Comments on that, Paul?
[02:26:21.897 --> 02:26:27.059]  Yeah, they used it against Bev Harris to try and get a list of people who visited her website.
[02:26:27.359 --> 02:26:28.999]  Which is exposing election fraud!
[02:26:29.439 --> 02:26:30.720]  Yeah, it's that terrorism.
[02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:36.902]  They used it for the guy who was shackled at a New York airport, kept in leg chains for 24 hours without water.
[02:26:37.262 --> 02:26:40.423]  Homeland Security did that under, you know, quote, the Patriot Act.
[02:26:40.643 --> 02:26:50.826]  And that's a British citizen, a white guy, imagine if you're an Arab how bad it is, who they claimed may have owed a few thousand dollars on a car, and it turned out he quote, paid the debt.
[02:26:50.886 --> 02:26:56.848]  So now having bad debts, and they admit that gets run through the database, gets you shackled for 24 hours.
[02:26:57.228 --> 02:26:58.949]  See, that's how these staged events work.
[02:26:59.309 --> 02:27:02.410]  It's all a staged hearing, and they go, oh, show me one example.
[02:27:03.230 --> 02:27:08.272]  Well, what I'm saying is that Orrin Hatch ended this committee by
[02:27:09.335 --> 02:27:14.780]  Supposedly trying to shut down the questioning on it.
[02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:17.363]  Well, Orrin Hatch, thanks for the call, DJ.
[02:27:17.403 --> 02:27:18.284]  I mean, good points.
[02:27:18.884 --> 02:27:26.832]  Look, what we have to explain here is that Orrin Hatch is for Arnold Schwarzenegger being president.
[02:27:27.192 --> 02:27:28.654]  Orrin Hatch is for open borders.
[02:27:29.154 --> 02:27:30.736]  Orrin Hatch is for gun control.
[02:27:31.497 --> 02:27:31.717]  Paul?
[02:27:33.010 --> 02:27:36.013]  Well yeah, I mean Kerry voted for the Patriot Act, they all did.
[02:27:36.554 --> 02:27:47.945]  Most people don't realise that, you know, there's this whole debate about, oh we're gonna, most of it expires in 2005, we're gonna not let them renew it and all that kind of thing.
[02:27:48.125 --> 02:27:52.630]  10%, only 10% of the whole Act has a sunset clause, so most of it is indefinite.
[02:27:53.388 --> 02:27:57.550]  Yeah, and the stuff that isn't indefinite is just little meaningless sections.
[02:27:58.271 --> 02:28:00.352]  John in Tennessee, then Charlie and others.
[02:28:00.452 --> 02:28:01.252]  John, go ahead.
[02:28:01.833 --> 02:28:12.578]  Alan Dershowitz was on Hannity & Combs the day after you, promoting his favorite topic of the need to legalize torture of American citizens by local police, all because of Nick Berg.
[02:28:13.159 --> 02:28:21.143]  And you mentioned that Georgia tried to pass a law, I think in 96, to legalize the guillotine, cut American heads off, and cannibalize the body parts.
[02:28:21.977 --> 02:28:24.339]  Which are worth, I guess, half a million dollars a corpse.
[02:28:25.280 --> 02:28:36.671]  So, Hollywood could make new PR horror movies that are crossed between Crooked Cop, The Macon County Line, and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre by Abu Ghraib prison guards coming back to America.
[02:28:39.934 --> 02:28:47.781]  Well, I mean, Alan Dershowitz, the big liberal... Remember the Baptist Church getting shot up a few years ago in Fort Worth?
[02:28:49.122 --> 02:28:59.508]  No, I got on air and said, I saw him, this is about five years ago now, I saw him on Crossfire say, Christians are pro-gun, they deserve what happened to them.
[02:29:00.408 --> 02:29:07.392]  I said that about Muslims or Jews, and people didn't believe me, and they actually went and got the transcript off CNN, where he said it.
[02:29:07.432 --> 02:29:08.833]  He said, we deserve it.
[02:29:09.433 --> 02:29:10.574]  This guy is sick.
[02:29:11.254 --> 02:29:12.975]  He came to Austin to promote torture.
[02:29:12.995 --> 02:29:13.856]  Go ahead, John.
[02:29:14.591 --> 02:29:26.776]  Well, last week a caller to Clear Channel on one of their blowtorches in Nashville said his car was towed after it broke down on the interstate, and he got a parking ticket and vehicle seizure for violating the Homeland Security Act.
[02:29:27.456 --> 02:29:32.118]  And the lawyers and judges who host that show said he should plead guilty to terrorism and pay the ticket.
[02:29:33.259 --> 02:29:33.799]  I believe it!
[02:29:33.899 --> 02:29:34.459]  It's sick!
[02:29:36.160 --> 02:29:37.060]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.541 --> 02:29:39.141]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:39.161 --> 02:29:42.763]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:46.562 --> 02:29:50.928]  Most of us have had a cafe we frequented because the service was so wonderful or the food was so great.
[02:29:51.088 --> 02:29:58.137]  The Silver Bear Cafe understands this philosophy and has incorporated these ideals into a website that offers food for thought to nourish the mind.

[02:30:19.898 --> 02:30:22.580]  Membership in the bear will teach you the secrets of financial freedom.
[02:30:22.740 --> 02:30:25.042]  How the runaway government is crushing the American dream.
[02:30:25.362 --> 02:30:29.265]  Why wars are played out across the globe, the fractional reserve system, etc.
[02:30:29.465 --> 02:30:32.126]  Where we're headed and what you can do to prepare yourself.
[02:30:32.467 --> 02:30:33.567]  Knowledge is power.

[02:31:51.592 --> 02:31:52.333]  You heard that right.
[02:31:52.533 --> 02:31:55.295]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[02:31:55.476 --> 02:31:56.757]  You don't have to pay them off.
[02:31:56.977 --> 02:31:58.378]  The banks are defrauding you.
[02:31:58.658 --> 02:31:59.999]  Now is the time to fight back.
[02:32:00.219 --> 02:32:02.802]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.

[02:32:42.043 --> 02:32:43.423]  You lose nothing but the debt.
[02:32:59.831 --> 02:33:08.575]  I have seen the news articles, and they've got it in the Patriot Act and the Homeland Security Act, where blocking traffic is an act of terrorism.
[02:33:08.615 --> 02:33:19.041]  We've seen them try to pass it at the state level in places like Oregon, where if you download music illegally, block traffic, have a firearm illegally, it's life in prison in a forest labor camp.
[02:33:19.581 --> 02:33:24.664]  But they know that 99.9% of people aren't going to go read the legislation.
[02:33:25.555 --> 02:33:31.836]  And so, John, just finishing up with you, you said that you were listening to talk radio and they had this judge and a lawyer on.
[02:33:31.856 --> 02:33:38.857]  The guy said, yeah, my car broke down, so they said that Homeland Security wanted to charge me and has charged me now.
[02:33:39.717 --> 02:33:41.958]  And the host said that this was a good thing.
[02:33:42.598 --> 02:33:47.379]  Yeah, that talk radio show is on before Art Bell on Saturday night, so that should tell you something.
[02:33:47.439 --> 02:33:50.659]  But it's a good show, titled Legally Speaking, out of Nashville.
[02:33:51.119 --> 02:33:54.200]  But the lawyers did try to pretend that no such law existed.
[02:33:54.659 --> 02:34:11.594]  They may have been ignorant, but Tennessee Code 3913-801 is the Terrorism Prevention and Response Act of 2002, and it defines terrorism as, quote, any offense under the laws of Tennessee that directly or indirectly affects the conduct of a unit of government, end quote.
[02:34:11.874 --> 02:34:21.642]  Now again, any offense that affects the conducts of protesting, and this is what the neocons are saying on talk radio, arrest those that disagree with the government.
[02:34:21.682 --> 02:34:22.243]  Paul Watson?
[02:34:23.368 --> 02:34:35.960]  And also, we had the news story which said that the latest changes to the Patriot Act would include executions, was it, for any crime which was punishable by over 20 years imprisonment?
[02:34:36.520 --> 02:34:38.082]  Any crime, not terrorism.
[02:34:39.252 --> 02:34:45.357]  Well, I mean, every day I read, Homeland Security's paying for Texas to have thousands more cameras per city!
[02:34:45.637 --> 02:34:51.041]  The Homeland Security Department is getting involved in crime-fighting because crime weakens the Republic.
[02:34:51.081 --> 02:34:56.005]  See, anything that weakens it, any... it's all terror!
[02:34:57.637 --> 02:35:03.381]  And also those, what was it, 4,000 new face-scanning cameras in New York City.
[02:35:03.421 --> 02:35:05.543]  That was from Homeland Security.
[02:35:05.663 --> 02:35:10.386]  And that's going to be a billion dollars, and it's said to fight crime.
[02:35:10.406 --> 02:35:12.268]  We're going to fight crime.
[02:35:12.548 --> 02:35:14.510]  Hey, you don't like this, John?
[02:35:14.530 --> 02:35:16.051]  Well, wait until the new draft comes in.
[02:35:16.071 --> 02:35:17.572]  You're going to be their slave.
[02:35:18.351 --> 02:35:22.615]  I've been in the military and those vaccines will tear you up better than any bullet.
[02:35:22.875 --> 02:35:25.237]  That's, see, that's what Al-Qaeda says.
[02:35:25.677 --> 02:35:29.320]  Al-Qaeda would say the vaccines were bad to stop the troops from taking it.
[02:35:29.620 --> 02:35:34.964]  Al-Qaeda would say that depleting uranium is bad, when of course it kills you, but that's good for the homeland!
[02:35:35.025 --> 02:35:35.485]  Die!
[02:35:35.545 --> 02:35:35.925]  Die!
[02:35:35.965 --> 02:35:36.606]  It's good!
[02:35:36.906 --> 02:35:38.547]  Kill the troops for the homeland!
[02:35:40.849 --> 02:35:45.393]  Well, a hundred million Americans are prosecuted every year for misdemeanor traffic crimes.
[02:35:45.893 --> 02:35:47.795]  That means a hundred million Americans are now
[02:35:48.379 --> 02:35:48.779]  Terrorists.
[02:35:49.680 --> 02:35:50.481]  Under the new homeland law.
[02:35:50.501 --> 02:35:51.302]  Well, that's right.
[02:35:51.322 --> 02:35:52.242]  You're all bad.
[02:35:52.262 --> 02:35:54.104]  You've got to learn to be slaves.
[02:35:54.164 --> 02:35:54.985]  It's the new freedom.
[02:35:56.846 --> 02:35:58.668]  Well... I'm not being sarcastic here, though.
[02:35:58.688 --> 02:36:00.509]  I mean, what we're doing to our troops is horrible.
[02:36:01.110 --> 02:36:06.855]  And they admit that depleting uranium is a heavy metal and is a... something that's radioactive is killing them.
[02:36:07.255 --> 02:36:09.377]  Well, it's sabotage and treason from within.
[02:36:11.539 --> 02:36:12.800]  There's no other explanation.
[02:36:13.020 --> 02:36:16.623]  You know, John, I bet you don't like it that Eliot Spencer of the New York
[02:36:17.430 --> 02:36:23.153]  Attorney General is basically calling the former head of the Stock Exchange a mobster.
[02:36:23.593 --> 02:36:29.336]  I bet you've got a problem with all the scams that this guy ran, or maybe you think it's great.
[02:36:29.636 --> 02:36:36.660]  Well, I think, you know, he's trying to play golf, I guess, with Michael Eisner, who pays himself $150 million a year at Disney and ABC.
[02:36:37.580 --> 02:36:45.424]  So he's hanging out with the $300 million Rush Limbaugh's and the billion dollar other media moguls like Ted Turner.
[02:36:45.444 --> 02:36:46.785]  He just wants to play with the boys.
[02:36:49.614 --> 02:36:52.815]  But the point is, he's been involved in myriad scams.
[02:36:52.855 --> 02:37:01.719]  I mean, it's every office we've got, or even every private group, they don't produce anything, they just rob.
[02:37:02.239 --> 02:37:03.300]  And the new robber barons.
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:15.345]  I mean, you've got 50,000 cops in New York City and not a one of them is man enough to find probable cause and arrest the mobbed up Mayor Giuliani or Grasso or Bush when he comes to town for killing cops.
[02:37:15.405 --> 02:37:17.886]  Because Bush is a cop killer and the cops won't even arrest him.
[02:37:19.560 --> 02:37:28.507]  Well, that's true, and then now the Commission's tried to blame the cops and the firemen when they took all the transmission tapes that show the bombs.
[02:37:28.907 --> 02:37:31.649]  I mean, how did the Commission get down to blaming cops?
[02:37:32.169 --> 02:37:35.432]  They said Bush or no one did anything but the cops and the firemen.
[02:37:35.712 --> 02:37:36.453]  You're bad.
[02:37:36.693 --> 02:37:38.114]  Paul, that was incredible, wasn't it?
[02:37:38.991 --> 02:37:39.951]  It was astounding.
[02:37:39.971 --> 02:37:45.773]  I actually had a cartoon up which showed the ghosts of the firemen before the Commission.
[02:37:45.893 --> 02:38:00.596]  And you know, the Commission head, Keane, you know, Bin Laden's business partner, you know, blaming them for the disaster when they were running into the burning buildings while the Port Authority was telling people to stay in the South Tower.
[02:38:01.686 --> 02:38:05.329]  Well, you know, before the second plane crashed and after the second plane crashed.
[02:38:05.349 --> 02:38:08.991]  Well, it's the fireman's fault, Paul, and you know, maybe they worked for Al-Qaeda.
[02:38:09.732 --> 02:38:10.472]  Maybe you did.
[02:38:12.113 --> 02:38:13.695]  Don't question Chairman Keane.
[02:38:14.255 --> 02:38:17.577]  Chairman Keane is our king.
[02:38:17.657 --> 02:38:18.898]  He created Earth.
[02:38:21.380 --> 02:38:24.422]  All these people, I mean, to watch that Giuliani commission.
[02:38:25.086 --> 02:38:30.291]  There's just stomach churning because I mean these people get what five minutes to ask the questions.
[02:38:30.311 --> 02:38:32.413]  This is supposed to be getting to the bottom of what happened.
[02:38:32.893 --> 02:38:35.536]  Every single one of them just praise Giuliani.
[02:38:35.696 --> 02:38:37.458]  Oh you're so incredible.
[02:38:37.678 --> 02:38:39.019]  Oh you're so good.
[02:38:39.179 --> 02:38:43.544]  Oh you're so... Well the family members up there are being wusses.
[02:38:43.604 --> 02:38:49.189]  They should have their own community access TV shows and tell it like it is and they should all stand up one at a time
[02:38:49.679 --> 02:38:52.641]  And get thrown out one at a time and disrupt every one of those hearings.
[02:38:52.681 --> 02:38:55.682]  That's what they should do, but they don't have the guts to do it.
[02:38:57.083 --> 02:39:04.347]  Well, a lot of them have been, and they've been out in the hallways doing it, and we've got photos of, you know, twenty news cameras around them, but it's never in the newspaper.
[02:39:04.387 --> 02:39:04.987]  Thanks for the call.
[02:39:07.068 --> 02:39:10.050]  Let's go ahead now and take another call.
[02:39:10.070 --> 02:39:13.212]  Let's talk to Charlie in New York City.
[02:39:13.252 --> 02:39:14.132]  Go ahead, Charlie.
[02:39:14.492 --> 02:39:14.993]  Hi, Alex.
[02:39:15.733 --> 02:39:18.575]  Listen, a friend of mine about three months ago gave me your tape.
[02:39:19.677 --> 02:39:20.657]  9-11 rolled a tyranny.
[02:39:20.677 --> 02:39:23.858]  And I was a pretty happy, well-adjusted American.
[02:39:24.178 --> 02:39:28.100]  And, uh, since that time I've been listening to your show here on local radio.
[02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:32.701]  And quite frankly, my world has been turned upside down.
[02:39:33.441 --> 02:39:36.602]  Uh, what radio station do you listen to this on?
[02:39:36.702 --> 02:39:38.823]  Um, 1310 AM, uh, Dr. Wolf Station.
[02:39:39.043 --> 02:39:40.363]  Yeah, he's got three up there.
[02:39:40.824 --> 02:39:41.064]  Yeah.
[02:39:41.204 --> 02:39:41.904]  He's a great guy.
[02:39:41.944 --> 02:39:43.364]  Well, I'm glad people are taking action.
[02:39:43.404 --> 02:39:46.505]  So you're, well, I mean, aren't you glad now that you know the truth?
[02:39:47.446 --> 02:39:48.386]  Yeah, but, uh,
[02:39:49.838 --> 02:39:59.181]  I'm zealous, but I find myself angry and frustrated because the apathy and the ignorance is just incredible.
[02:39:59.841 --> 02:40:01.842]  I think you just invented a new word, but I like it.
[02:40:02.062 --> 02:40:03.382]  Flustrated.
[02:40:03.442 --> 02:40:04.743]  You're flustered and frustrated.
[02:40:06.543 --> 02:40:07.003]  It happens.
[02:40:07.503 --> 02:40:08.244]  That's a good word.
[02:40:08.344 --> 02:40:08.944]  Flustrated.
[02:40:09.124 --> 02:40:11.285]  I get frustrated every day too, Paul.
[02:40:11.305 --> 02:40:12.505]  Do you get frustrated?
[02:40:13.431 --> 02:40:27.255]  I do, because, I mean, just to read the newspapers for several hours a day and be faced with that level of evil on a daily basis, it would have that effect, but at least you know that, you know, if this amount of evil exists, then it's almost good.
[02:40:27.815 --> 02:40:32.477]  But just to know that that evil exists, then it is empowering in a certain sense.
[02:40:32.657 --> 02:40:38.259]  Yeah, it's good to know the full horror, and now you can carry out the responsibility to protect yourself and your family.
[02:40:39.519 --> 02:40:41.200]  You've been at this for a while.
[02:40:42.907 --> 02:40:51.111]  Have you had any luck accessing billboards on interstates, local radio, TV, putting these things on?
[02:40:51.151 --> 02:40:54.052]  I mean, have you, or have they cut, they just wouldn't allow it?
[02:40:54.072 --> 02:41:00.256]  Well, if you're asking about having any luck, you can listen to us in three radio stations in upstate New York.
[02:41:00.356 --> 02:41:09.260]  I mean, we're on in Denver, and Los Angeles, and Austin, and Pensacola, Florida, and Kansas City, Missouri, and Albuquerque, New Mexico, I mean all over the place.
[02:41:10.198 --> 02:41:13.361]  But, you know, it's millions of people, but it's not tens of millions.
[02:41:13.421 --> 02:41:13.941]  It should be.
[02:41:14.402 --> 02:41:22.688]  But we're having a big effect, and people have, radio stations have put up billboards before, you know, around the country here in Austin.
[02:41:23.489 --> 02:41:25.790]  But again, I'm just one person in this fight, sir.
[02:41:25.851 --> 02:41:32.836]  It's all of us being part of a Bill of Rights culture, being part of the process of freedom.
[02:41:33.637 --> 02:41:35.318]  Paul, maybe you can break this down for him.
[02:41:36.576 --> 02:42:00.389]  Well, I would just say that if our examples, and we're just two people, are, you know, a microcosm of the wider awakening that is taking place, then it's reason to be optimistic, because the media attention that we've got just does to alone, especially Alex, in the past few months, is gargantuan and he's growing all the time, because obviously when you get picked up by, say, Vanity Fair,
[02:42:01.478 --> 02:42:21.509]  Other big television companies or newspapers or radio stations then become interested and so your platform grows and grows and it's exponential and in the past few months it's just you know growing out of proportion so we've got them on the ropes at the moment there's no doubt about that which makes them more dangerous but at least we know that our platform is growing all the time and many new people are coming on board.
[02:42:21.529 --> 02:42:29.914]  Alex, do I have permission to advertise and put your movie at a local theater?
[02:42:30.691 --> 02:42:41.697]  In other words, if I want to spend $30,000 on advertising, and I want to show it on a Saturday night... Well, you wouldn't need to spend $30,000 on advertising.
[02:42:42.197 --> 02:42:48.001]  Well, if I want to go billboards, newspaper, radio... Well, you'd want to do that to show it for a month in a theater.
[02:42:49.461 --> 02:42:54.064]  I mean, a couple thousand dollars in advertising would pack the theater.
[02:42:54.776 --> 02:42:58.017]  Every showing we've had of road to tyranny across the country.
[02:42:58.677 --> 02:43:00.338]  People, it's been packed every time.
[02:43:00.618 --> 02:43:04.219]  Do I have to get this legally, or do I contact your people?
[02:43:04.639 --> 02:43:05.300]  Well, it depends.
[02:43:05.360 --> 02:43:12.442]  I mean, if it's a big profit thing, then I have questions, but I've certainly authorized people to show the videos at theaters.
[02:43:13.243 --> 02:43:14.144]  Alright, I'll be in touch.
[02:43:14.484 --> 02:43:15.904]  Alright, well, I appreciate that, sir.
[02:43:16.305 --> 02:43:17.265]  But there's a lot you can do.
[02:43:17.285 --> 02:43:19.867]  I mean, go get your own radio talk show on a Saturday night.
[02:43:20.307 --> 02:43:33.994]  You want to plop money down, I mean, it should cost you on a big station, maybe $500 an hour, and then you can talk to tens of thousands of people, or go pay the 50 bucks, 100 bucks, and get a local access TV show and talk to thousands, you know, once a week.
[02:43:34.694 --> 02:43:37.516]  I mean, there's a lot of... Look, you don't need to promote me.
[02:43:38.411 --> 02:43:40.212]  Okay, I mean, that's fine if you want to do that.
[02:43:40.413 --> 02:43:43.255]  I need more people up here on the front lines.
[02:43:43.355 --> 02:43:45.016]  We need more people to be leaders, Paul.
[02:43:46.147 --> 02:44:09.360]  Well yeah, most people are just followers and sometimes it is a case that we're just preaching to the choir but people don't realise how easy nowadays it is with the internet and the growth of the internet to create your own media platform and then in a sense we infiltrate the mainstream media because time and again, just like this Berg thing with his Sunday Times article, they read what we're writing on the internet and that's what, you know,
[02:44:10.060 --> 02:44:10.901]  I don't think so.
[02:44:22.088 --> 02:44:28.090]  We don't have the biggest freedom websites, you know, truth-seeker websites out there, but they're big.
[02:44:28.430 --> 02:44:38.613]  If we get tens of millions of visitors a month, and their site's much bigger than us, and they're getting tens and tens and tens of millions a month, and it's growing and growing and growing, I mean, I'm seeing an awakening.
[02:44:39.194 --> 02:44:43.155]  Paul, I remember telling you when I started getting you a bunch of radio interviews, you said,
[02:44:44.508 --> 02:44:49.392]  I'm not going to get beat up on these shows, and I said the host may, but I said most of the callers are going to call in and agree with you.
[02:44:50.233 --> 02:44:52.735]  And then you went and did it, and you were surprised.
[02:44:52.795 --> 02:44:54.937]  I mean, what has your experience been?
[02:44:55.958 --> 02:45:08.228]  Well, yeah, before I got those radio interviews, we're talking, you know, late last year, I actually made a big stack of notes on how I would respond to the different accusations and attacks that would be made against me.
[02:45:08.248 --> 02:45:11.791]  You know, you're a liberal, you're a commie, you're in it for the money or whatever.
[02:45:12.435 --> 02:45:16.520]  And I never needed to use those notes because I go on liberal shows.
[02:45:16.820 --> 02:45:24.368]  I've been on a liberal show in Pittsburgh twice, at least the host liberal, took about 10 calls in total, only one disagreed.
[02:45:25.029 --> 02:45:31.436]  In Britain, in my own country, I went on a show, took about six or seven calls, only one disagreed.
[02:45:31.456 --> 02:45:33.579]  The hosts basically both agreed.
[02:45:34.139 --> 02:45:34.359]  I don't
[02:45:50.004 --> 02:46:00.211]  You know, part of me didn't believe Alex when he tells you that, you know, he's charted all these callers to all the shows that he's been on, thousands of shows over the past few years.
[02:46:00.791 --> 02:46:04.634]  And 90% plus agree, but it's true because I've experienced it personally.
[02:46:05.174 --> 02:46:09.337]  And compared to five years ago, obviously, in Alex's experience, that didn't happen.
[02:46:09.397 --> 02:46:10.998]  So it shows the effect that we're having.
[02:46:11.974 --> 02:46:14.715]  It shows the effect that you out there are taking action.
[02:46:14.755 --> 02:46:20.537]  But again, the Peter Jennings, the Dan Rathers of the world make you feel like you're all alone, that nobody thinks like you do.
[02:46:21.578 --> 02:46:23.118]  And that's not the case.
[02:46:24.139 --> 02:46:26.820]  And frankly, some of these so-called patriots want to think like that.
[02:46:27.080 --> 02:46:28.481]  Oh, we're the special chosen.
[02:46:28.781 --> 02:46:30.201]  Only we have the answers.
[02:46:30.241 --> 02:46:31.602]  Everyone else is stupid.
[02:46:32.342 --> 02:46:33.323]  No one else gets it.
[02:46:33.483 --> 02:46:33.783]  No.
[02:46:34.623 --> 02:46:39.305]  People are intelligent, know something's wrong, but they are ignorant in that they think that they are alone.
[02:46:41.600 --> 02:46:42.801]  Oh, it's incredible, Paul.
[02:46:44.042 --> 02:46:46.144]  Look, I saw this article in the Scotsman today.
[02:46:46.244 --> 02:46:49.066]  Britain fights EU proposals for random breath tests.
[02:46:49.687 --> 02:46:59.735]  The government is facing a bureaucratic struggle to fight off a European Union proposal for British police to adopt continental-style random breathalyzer tests of motorists to cut down on drunk driving.
[02:47:00.743 --> 02:47:09.286]  The Home Office yesterday rejected as insufficient the introduction of random stop and search type policing, which is being recommended by the European Commission.
[02:47:09.326 --> 02:47:14.208]  Britain, Ireland, and Denmark are the only EU countries where random checks are not legal.
[02:47:14.528 --> 02:47:15.288]  What does that mean?
[02:47:15.308 --> 02:47:17.329]  Paul, I've probably seen 50 articles
[02:47:18.419 --> 02:47:36.902]  Where they make clubbers give DNA swabs or drug tests, or they take your hair out for drug testing, and where they walk you through scanners that image your naked body, where they stop people and take DNA randomly at road checkpoints, but then they come out and say, oh, look, we're against the EU, we're not going along with this.
[02:47:36.922 --> 02:47:45.204]  I mean, here in America, they'll randomly pull you over and demand breathalyzers at checkpoints, but then they claim they're not doing it, but then they claim they are doing it.
[02:47:45.884 --> 02:47:47.824]  What's really going on over in England?
[02:47:48.775 --> 02:47:49.836]  Well, it's pre-crime.
[02:47:50.056 --> 02:47:52.878]  It's guilty until proven innocent, obviously.
[02:47:52.918 --> 02:47:56.701]  And I mean, it's the stamp of global government that the EU can make these laws.
[02:47:57.261 --> 02:48:02.725]  They're now proposing dividing Britain up into different Euro regions.
[02:48:03.025 --> 02:48:05.227]  So even, you know, it gets down to that level.
[02:48:05.787 --> 02:48:14.033]  And we've got Euro elections coming up in Britain in June, which will decide on who represents Britain in the European Parliament.
[02:48:14.454 --> 02:48:17.336]  And the only party, and this is getting a sizable
[02:48:19.037 --> 02:48:35.735]  The only party that stands for getting out of Europe completely is the UK Independence Party, which is why the Liberal Democrats, Labour, the Socialist Left, along with the Tories, the so-called Right Wing,
[02:48:36.335 --> 02:48:36.855]  Yes, I think so.
[02:48:56.465 --> 02:49:07.175]  They're the only party opposing it and opposing these kinds of ridiculous intrusions into British sovereignty and so the right and the left of the mainstream political Britain have teamed up to demonize it.
[02:49:07.195 --> 02:49:08.196]  Well, it's the same thing.
[02:49:08.216 --> 02:49:13.421]  The majority of Americans are against open borders but the Republicans and Democrats team up to keep the borders open.
[02:49:16.320 --> 02:49:27.054]  It's funny that the media in Britain give all the focus to this one party that's anti-Europe but is also basically advocating a white Aryan race that's basically neo-Nazis.
[02:49:27.074 --> 02:49:35.244]  The media gives them all the attention and then says if you're anti-Europe then you're with the BNP, which is basically the modern day Nazi party, so that's how they do it.
[02:49:36.340 --> 02:49:37.040]  That's how they do it?
[02:49:37.120 --> 02:49:37.941]  You're for freedom?
[02:49:38.241 --> 02:49:41.162]  There's a Nazi who's for freedom a hundred miles from here!
[02:49:41.222 --> 02:49:42.042]  You must be with him!
[02:49:44.303 --> 02:49:47.964]  What about UN troops raping people in the Congo?
[02:49:48.585 --> 02:50:04.871]  The headline is UN troops buy sex from teenage refugees in Congo camp, but then the next line in The Independent is, teenage rape victims fleeing war in Democratic Republic of the Congo are being sexually exploited by the United Nations peacekeeping troops sent to stop their suffering.
[02:50:05.774 --> 02:50:06.394]  Well, exactly.
[02:50:06.454 --> 02:50:07.034]  It's couched.
[02:50:07.755 --> 02:50:16.037]  I mean, this is bad, the fact that, even willingly, these children would go and do this when they're paid, but the actual truth is that they're being raped, and it's paedophilia.
[02:50:16.717 --> 02:50:21.138]  Well, they say to them, you don't get any food unless you have money, so go work in the UN brothel.
[02:50:21.919 --> 02:50:26.260]  Yeah, and remember the story, UN ship carried child prostitutes.
[02:50:26.540 --> 02:50:33.742]  So this was ordered from the very top, and the woman that blew the whistle on it in the first place, Karen Bolkovich, was sacked for doing so.
[02:50:34.975 --> 02:50:36.515]  That's fired, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:36.615 --> 02:50:37.176]  Canned.
[02:50:37.916 --> 02:50:40.296]  We'll come back and get into a few final news items.
[02:50:40.937 --> 02:50:41.917]  I'm Alex Jones.

[02:53:36.701 --> 02:53:40.743]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:53:56.847 --> 02:54:16.171]  About every two weeks, a top American, Russian, Australian, British bioweapons scientist, either in the development of super race-specific bioweapons or the treatment of it, is run over by a vehicle that then backs back over their body, is shot in the head, dies in an airlock accident, blows their head off,
[02:54:16.937 --> 02:54:18.058]  This is the New York Times.
[02:54:18.158 --> 02:54:22.002]  Russian scientist dies in Ebola accident at former weapons lab.
[02:54:22.422 --> 02:54:35.995]  A Russian scientist at a former Soviet biological weapons laboratory in Siberia has died after accidentally sticking himself with a needle laced with Ebola, the deadly virus from which there is no vaccine or treatment at the lab's parent Russian center announced over the weekend.
[02:54:37.222 --> 02:54:40.886]  And, uh, they say it raises concerns, though, about it being able to spread.
[02:54:41.146 --> 02:54:46.732]  Bush is going to build three dozen Level 4 bioweapon labs around the U.S., producing this in mass.
[02:54:47.292 --> 02:54:48.333]  This and other nasties.
[02:54:48.414 --> 02:54:52.638]  Paul, what do you think is going on with all these scientists dropping dead on a weekly basis?
[02:54:53.610 --> 02:55:08.293]  Well, first of all, how naive do they think we are, you know, to imagine that people are just walking around with, you know, needles full of Ebola and just accidentally sticking it... Yeah, in Level 4 labs, you have your hands... Inside the containment unit.
[02:55:08.353 --> 02:55:11.193]  Yeah, using robotic arms.
[02:55:12.434 --> 02:55:19.035]  So it's not even possible, and the premise that somebody would just be walking around casually with this is, you know, out of the question.
[02:55:19.804 --> 02:55:31.207]  But again, people have postulated that it's to do with this agenda, which the Israelis are at the forefront of, along with America, of developing this race-specific bioweapon, first to be used on the Arabs.
[02:55:31.848 --> 02:55:36.709]  And many of these people who've died have had connections with that, including David Kelly.
[02:55:38.149 --> 02:55:40.832]  Well, that will kill real Jews if they release that.
[02:55:40.852 --> 02:55:49.840]  I mean, the blond-haired, blue-eyed, European-ruling elite that's there to kill and destroy Jews, the Nazi-Zionist leaders, and that's really who they are, folks.
[02:55:50.220 --> 02:55:54.925]  They're going to be just fine, but anybody who's really Semitic is going to be in deep trouble if they release this.
[02:55:55.928 --> 02:56:03.270]  Well yeah, there's an argument that they're trying to perfect it, so it only targets Arabs with certain genes, but even that would be very difficult.
[02:56:04.010 --> 02:56:11.332]  But again, this is the whole agenda of the bio-research, and this is why these people keep dropping dead at this alarming rate.
[02:56:11.492 --> 02:56:13.253]  And again, we're force-fed these
[02:56:13.693 --> 02:56:16.254]  Ridiculous scenarios that these are all accidents.
[02:56:16.334 --> 02:56:17.535]  I mean, what was the other one?
[02:56:17.815 --> 02:56:22.616]  Somebody walked into a rotating turbine by accident or something.
[02:56:22.676 --> 02:56:26.258]  It's just out of the question that these amount of accidents would happen.
[02:56:27.298 --> 02:56:30.700]  Yeah, down in Houston, in two week period, two people died.
[02:56:30.780 --> 02:56:34.881]  One of them, a van jumps a curb, smashes him, backs back over him and runs off.
[02:56:35.121 --> 02:56:36.882]  The police go, just an accident, hit and run.
[02:56:39.522 --> 02:56:40.762]  Yeah, one more article.
[02:56:41.162 --> 02:56:42.883]  Those missing Togumbo reports.
[02:56:42.963 --> 02:56:46.044]  Antonio Togumbo, the general, more dirty tricks in Torturegate.
[02:56:46.784 --> 02:56:50.505]  This, I believe, is on PrisonPlanet.com or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:56:51.145 --> 02:56:55.206]  And it gets into some of the excised documents.
[02:56:55.286 --> 02:56:56.626]  What's in those documents?
[02:56:56.886 --> 02:57:04.248]  If the report admits raping women and sodomizing people and beating them to death, what could be worse that they would excise, Paul?
[02:57:05.265 --> 02:57:22.056]  I've no idea because the article doesn't say, but I mean what happened is the CERNE Armed Services Committee got the supposed 8,000 pages, 6,000 pages, sorry, stacked them up against 6,000 blank pages of paper and noticed that 2,000 pages were missing.
[02:57:22.336 --> 02:57:29.041]  So it's reminiscent of the Iraq weapons dossier, which was, you know, a third of it was missing.
[02:57:29.101 --> 02:57:32.003]  So they then had the pretext to say, oh look, they're hiding weapons.
[02:57:32.443 --> 02:57:34.965]  Which, I mean, the UN was complicit in that as well because
[02:57:38.249 --> 02:57:42.093]  Alright, let's plug PrisonPlanet.tv here at the end.

[02:58:33.269 --> 02:58:33.890]  Have a great day.
[02:58:36.650 --> 02:58:44.556]  Skyrocketing oil prices, the economy on the brink, the plunging dollar, terrorism, the government spending $1.80 for every dollar it collects.
[02:58:44.877 --> 02:58:50.141]  Never in the history of our country have we faced so many threats to our freedoms, rights, and individual security.
[02:58:50.341 --> 02:58:52.943]  How long can we continue without a fracture occurring?
[02:58:53.063 --> 02:58:58.087]  With the events that recently rocked the elections in Spain, what will happen as we get closer to our own election?
