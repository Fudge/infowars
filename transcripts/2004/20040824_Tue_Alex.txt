[00:00:05.457 --> 00:00:06.098]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.758 --> 00:00:07.838]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.538 --> 00:00:09.638]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:11.139]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:12.739]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:17.060]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.701]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.011]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[00:00:47.111 --> 00:00:48.892]  It is the 24th day of August 2004.
[00:00:50.312 --> 00:00:52.913]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:59.755]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and now the new one, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:01:04.725 --> 00:01:12.731]  Well, we have a particularly large stack of news and information to cover today, and a guest joining us that we'll announce a little bit later.
[00:01:12.791 --> 00:01:16.154]  But right now, let's go ahead and dive straight into it.
[00:01:16.894 --> 00:01:20.457]  Earthquake rattles Olympic venues.
[00:01:21.358 --> 00:01:25.761]  An earthquake rattled Olympic venues today in and around Athens.
[00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:30.285]  The Athens Geodynamic Institute said the
[00:01:31.237 --> 00:01:38.521]  A tremor had a preliminary magnitude of 4.5 and occurred at 3.38 p.m.
[00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:39.521]  Boy, that's a tremor.
[00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:39.521]  4.5?
[00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:41.962]  That's pretty substantial.
[00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:48.425]  It was centered about 42 miles northeast of Athens, or 12 miles beneath the Aegean Sea.
[00:01:50.046 --> 00:01:55.049]  Yeah, I mean, if they had a 4.5 in a major city, that would break some stuff.
[00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.310]  There is no reason to panic.
[00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.010]  It was a very small quake.
[00:01:59.091 --> 00:02:00.011]  Oh, now it's a quake.
[00:02:00.723 --> 00:02:02.404]  A minute ago it was a tremor.
[00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:13.313]  Again, I'm not an expert on this stuff, but I believe over 4.1, or over 4 point, it's an earthquake.
[00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:16.936]  But again, I should go, I guess pull out an encyclopedia and check on that.
[00:02:16.956 --> 00:02:19.157]  But first it's a tremor, now it's a quake.
[00:02:20.018 --> 00:02:28.845]  The head of the Greek Sybil Defense Agency said there was no reports of injuries or damage from the quake felt throughout the greater Athens area.
[00:02:30.812 --> 00:02:39.094]  In 1999, a 5.9 magnitude quake near Athens killed 143 people, injured about 2,000, and left thousands more homeless.
[00:02:40.054 --> 00:02:43.975]  The question is, is this the prelude to something larger?
[00:02:44.675 --> 00:02:49.516]  And they have big earthquakes in Greece, in Italy, in surrounding areas.
[00:02:51.476 --> 00:02:54.557]  Alright, that's just a little side issue, but it is interesting.
[00:02:54.737 --> 00:02:59.338]  Maybe God doesn't like the fact that they've got Adolf Hitler's symbols all over the city.
[00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:10.093]  Oh, you forgot that all of the Olympic symbolism, the rings, the torch, that's all was invented by Adolf Hitler himself.
[00:03:10.633 --> 00:03:14.395]  Just a side issue, and I was really being sarcastic.
[00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:20.538]  I don't think God is mad at the people at the Olympics for the symbols they have, because most of them are ignorant.
[00:03:21.258 --> 00:03:26.780]  But God probably is mad that the Olympics do have all of that pagan history.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.922]  But just, again, just some background there.
[00:03:31.295 --> 00:03:36.940]  CNN hijacker visa found in flight 93 wreckage.
[00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:39.822]  It's getting really rich.
[00:03:40.162 --> 00:03:50.671]  Remember that one of the flights that hit the World Trade Center towers, they said that magically the passport jumped out of his jacket
[00:03:51.328 --> 00:04:05.400]  Through the burning plane, through the wreckage, past the girders, out of the building and the tens of millions of pieces of paper that were in the structure, out into the street to be found by a police officer.
[00:04:07.794 --> 00:04:09.856]  Unscathed, not a scratch on it.
[00:04:10.256 --> 00:04:16.180]  And then later it turned out that the person on the passport was still alive and the FBI said, okay, it was a mistake.
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.781]  We never really found the passport.
[00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:22.404]  But wait, you showed it on the news the day after 9-11 and said it was conclusive proof.
[00:04:22.945 --> 00:04:25.587]  And then no one ever addresses that piece of disinformation.
[00:04:26.027 --> 00:04:29.750]  Well, now they're back with what is obviously another one.
[00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.632]  And we'll give you details of this when we return.
[00:04:34.113 --> 00:04:37.095]  Also, Rumsfeld to escape Abu Ghraib blame.
[00:04:37.785 --> 00:04:38.605]  for the commission.
[00:04:39.086 --> 00:04:45.208]  He appointed Weatherman Terror Group back to wreak havoc at RNC New York Post.
[00:04:45.668 --> 00:04:46.488]  Give me a break.
[00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:53.451]  Christian Science Monitor went inside the Najaf Mosque and there's no weapons, of course, but who cares.
[00:04:53.871 --> 00:04:55.112]  Brett Hames has killed everyone.
[00:04:55.452 --> 00:04:56.132]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.275 --> 00:05:04.858]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[00:05:05.118 --> 00:05:06.540]  If so, hope has arrived.
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.461]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[00:05:08.722 --> 00:05:13.886]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[00:05:14.266 --> 00:05:18.750]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:27.698]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[00:05:28.198 --> 00:05:29.339]  Gum disease is serious.
[00:05:29.799 --> 00:05:33.560]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[00:05:33.841 --> 00:05:40.463]  With a regular program of oral hygiene, including vitamin toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[00:05:40.804 --> 00:05:44.845]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.

[00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:08.685]  Skyrocketing oil prices, the economy on the brink, the plunging dollar, terrorism, the government spending $1.80 for every dollar it collects.
[00:06:09.006 --> 00:06:14.291]  Never in the history of our country have we faced so many threats to our freedoms, rights, and individual security.
[00:06:14.472 --> 00:06:17.094]  How long can we continue without a fracture occurring?
[00:06:17.194 --> 00:06:22.320]  With the events that recently rocked the elections in Spain, what will happen as we get closer to our own elections?
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.302]  Now is the time to begin preparing for such threats.
[00:06:25.583 --> 00:06:30.327]  Ready Reserve Foods has been helping businesses, government, and individuals for over 32 years.

[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.581]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:04.842]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:07:04.982 --> 00:07:08.884]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:07:08.924 --> 00:07:13.165]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:07:13.506 --> 00:07:17.087]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:07:17.167 --> 00:07:19.208]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:07:19.808 --> 00:07:22.711]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[00:07:22.751 --> 00:07:27.476]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:07:27.636 --> 00:07:30.679]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:07:30.859 --> 00:07:33.702]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:07:34.223 --> 00:07:40.329]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:44.652]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:07:45.053 --> 00:07:46.414]  Order your video today.
[00:07:46.814 --> 00:07:49.416]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.

[00:08:00.746 --> 00:08:05.810]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.452]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:13.019 --> 00:08:16.660]  I'm going to have to admit it.
[00:08:21.581 --> 00:08:30.563]  I am turning into the most soft-hearted, touchy-feely person you can imagine.
[00:08:31.183 --> 00:08:39.845]  I almost didn't make it to the studio today because I'm driving along and there's a lizard
[00:08:41.099 --> 00:08:43.500]  A green chameleon on my car.
[00:08:44.741 --> 00:08:50.724]  And in the past, I mean, I would frankly, I mean, I would care a little bit about the lizard, but I really wouldn't care.
[00:08:50.764 --> 00:08:53.786]  I wouldn't stop on the side of a dangerous road because he was about to blow off.
[00:08:54.906 --> 00:08:56.967]  And there was nothing but shopping centers on both sides.
[00:08:57.007 --> 00:08:58.328]  I didn't want to turn him loose there.
[00:08:59.349 --> 00:09:02.610]  And so I got a hold of him, which was not an easy feat.
[00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:09.274]  Basically, people thought I was nuts jumping on top of the rent car I'm driving since I totaled my Tahoe a few weeks ago.
[00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:18.109]  Here I am on the hood and crawling up, jumping up on top of the roof, trying to catch this green chameleon.
[00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:23.216]  In the past, folks, just a year or two ago, I wouldn't have behaved like this.
[00:09:23.236 --> 00:09:24.037]  It was probably stupid.
[00:09:24.057 --> 00:09:24.658]  It was dangerous.
[00:09:26.934 --> 00:09:30.575]  Then I'm holding him in my hand while I'm driving and he wiggles out of my hand somehow.
[00:09:30.715 --> 00:09:33.276]  Acts like he's held there tight but I don't want to squeeze him.
[00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:38.578]  He gets out and runs up my head while I'm driving and I have to pull over and he's somewhere hiding in my car.
[00:09:38.598 --> 00:09:43.159]  So my car's got all the windows down right now because it's like 100 degrees today.
[00:09:43.239 --> 00:09:48.421]  So hopefully the chameleon can get out of the car and I'm all worried about him right now.
[00:09:48.501 --> 00:09:54.063]  I'm tempted to go to rebroadcast and go dig around in my car that's full of papers and coffee
[00:09:54.938 --> 00:09:56.779]  Cups, and find it.
[00:09:58.141 --> 00:10:10.550]  And you're saying, Alex, we've got earthquakes in Athens, we've got new hijacker visa found in Flight 93 wreckage, we have got the mosque being blown to bits in Najaf, and the Shiites going absolutely ape.
[00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:18.836]  We've got this whole new world order coming down on us, and you're telling us about how you are, you know, having these love fests with lizards.
[00:10:19.897 --> 00:10:20.958]  What would David Icke say?
[00:10:22.375 --> 00:10:27.718]  But no, it's important and I really didn't want to talk about this but I am going to talk about it.
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.120]  We have to love life.
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.261]  We have to defend freedom.
[00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:41.965]  We have to love our families enough to be honest about the true nature of the New World Order and stand up against it.
[00:10:42.405 --> 00:10:47.427]  And that means we have to give our lives because can you imagine if I'm having these
[00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:52.731]  Ridiculous feelings about saving lizards.
[00:10:53.871 --> 00:10:59.352]  I mean, they get in my house, and then they die, and I'm always trying to catch them, these little geckos.
[00:11:00.893 --> 00:11:02.993]  It's really just a symptom of something.
[00:11:03.893 --> 00:11:11.495]  And maybe I've swung too far on the pendulum, or maybe it's just a product of having children.
[00:11:11.515 --> 00:11:16.416]  It develops and accentuates your nurturing instincts.
[00:11:16.476 --> 00:11:18.237]  Those are brought to the fore.
[00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.210]  What am I trying to get at here?
[00:11:23.871 --> 00:11:27.551]  America today is very cold, very callous.
[00:11:28.391 --> 00:11:31.392]  We only care about ourselves, myself included.
[00:11:32.772 --> 00:11:38.993]  We are so afraid of what our neighbors will think of us that we won't even talk to them about politics or religion.
[00:11:39.033 --> 00:11:43.934]  We're all living in little boxes or little self-contained worlds.
[00:11:47.155 --> 00:11:49.155]  We don't have any real community anymore.
[00:11:51.494 --> 00:12:18.286]  And people don't spend time with their children because they're too busy chasing the almighty dollar because that's most important to them in many cases and in some cases they've got to just to survive but some of the worst people out there are the middle class of America who have plenty of money but spend the least time of anybody with their children because their children come second or third to driving the Lexus or the Mercedes or to acting cool to
[00:12:20.672 --> 00:12:28.720]  Basically, being part of the world, setting the world first, setting materialism first, before God and family, and then country.
[00:12:31.342 --> 00:12:43.253]  And I'm not saying it's bad to have a Mercedes or a nice house, but when you make it an idol, when you worship it, that's what idolatry is, when you set it up before everything else, that's what's bad.
[00:12:44.534 --> 00:12:45.955]  You're saying, what does this have to do with
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:47.620]  Lizards.
[00:12:48.221 --> 00:12:51.783]  You know, trying to save lizards in your house and lizards on the car.
[00:12:51.803 --> 00:12:57.386]  You know, a lizard a week ago that I saw in the neighborhood pool that had fallen in.
[00:12:57.726 --> 00:12:59.467]  These things are everywhere and they're cute.
[00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:03.229]  You know, my wife's always been like this.
[00:13:03.289 --> 00:13:05.571]  Every week or two, bringing home new strays.
[00:13:06.111 --> 00:13:07.712]  New dogs and cats.
[00:13:07.872 --> 00:13:10.614]  And then we have to find them homes and it takes up all our time.
[00:13:10.914 --> 00:13:11.454]  But you know what?
[00:13:11.554 --> 00:13:12.875]  I love her because she does that.
[00:13:14.346 --> 00:13:17.469]  It's that need to defend defenseless things.
[00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:26.877]  And to know that we have killed, back in 97 it was 700,000 Iraqi children with the sanctions.
[00:13:31.661 --> 00:13:41.049]  And now the numbers of Iraqis are upwards of 2 million people, but the sanctions and the bombing have killed the weakest members of society, women and children.
[00:13:41.489 --> 00:13:42.650]  It really makes me sad.
[00:13:43.624 --> 00:13:51.446]  And it upsets me to know that we've had how many abortions coming up on 50 million abortions in this country?
[00:13:51.486 --> 00:14:09.650]  I mean, how callous, how cold-blooded are we to make psychological excuses and say, oh, it's just a choice, oh, it's not a human being, and then now New Jersey's passed a law to keep baby clones alive up until birth, and then three months after, they use them as body parts?
[00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:10.610]  Babies, folks!
[00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:11.430]  It's the law!
[00:14:12.823 --> 00:14:19.668]  And we just see euthanasia and the killing of old people who are begging for food and water.
[00:14:19.688 --> 00:14:22.290]  I mean, that's been in the Wall Street Journal, naming names.
[00:14:25.113 --> 00:14:25.833]  It's scary.
[00:14:25.873 --> 00:14:27.835]  I mean, we reap what we sow.
[00:14:28.715 --> 00:14:33.879]  Anything we go along with with this New World Order is only going to come back on us sevenfold.
[00:14:36.261 --> 00:14:38.443]  But the real point I was going to get to is
[00:14:39.597 --> 00:14:42.798]  That I, growing up, was a pretty callous person.
[00:14:43.959 --> 00:14:47.740]  And, I mean, obviously you've got to be callous in certain positions.
[00:14:48.821 --> 00:14:58.064]  And, you know, obviously I'm all for... I'm not going to the extreme of, oh, we shouldn't, you know, kill pigs and cows and chickens.
[00:14:58.684 --> 00:15:05.087]  But I do think we should do it humanely and have them open range and not in little boxes that are too small for their bodies.
[00:15:06.147 --> 00:15:15.012]  Plus, who wants to eat something that's been through all that hellish stress and get all those horrible hormones and antibiotics and garbage and toxins?
[00:15:15.032 --> 00:15:16.613]  I mean, again, that comes back on us.
[00:15:17.053 --> 00:15:19.695]  Cancer is up over 500 plus percent.
[00:15:21.276 --> 00:15:23.317]  Where am I going with all of this?
[00:15:24.078 --> 00:15:31.142]  Yesterday, a couple days a week, I'll steal a little time and go to the neighborhood pool and swim some laps.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:16:00.223]  And I'd gotten done swimming laps for about 45 minutes and was getting out and drying off and I watched this family walk in with probably a 10-year-old daughter, a 6-year-old daughter and a 2-year-old boy and he didn't have any hair and he had a chemotherapy port in his chest and he was having trouble walking and his parents, I could just feel their sorrow and they were trying to be happy in front of him and make him happy and play with him in the pool
[00:16:02.112 --> 00:16:04.953]  And again, there's things you can't describe with words.
[00:16:06.354 --> 00:16:30.082]  It was a sorrow I've never felt in my life because that little boy was really analogous or an example of all of the aborted babies, all of the children that have been murdered in Africa and Asia and America and in Iraq and in the Middle East and just all the evil of the New World Order.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:43.263]  And I just sat there and watched his parents, you know, and watching how he was so frail and skinny and how sick he was, but how sweet he was.
[00:16:43.903 --> 00:16:45.423]  And I started crying.
[00:16:45.823 --> 00:16:46.603]  I started crying.
[00:16:49.384 --> 00:16:52.145]  Because all this was running through my mind.
[00:16:53.005 --> 00:16:59.807]  I thought about how in the old neighborhood I lived in a few years ago, in one year, two toddlers died of cancer on my street.
[00:17:00.287 --> 00:17:01.407]  In a middle class neighborhood.
[00:17:02.071 --> 00:17:04.071]  And I know so many children that have cancer.
[00:17:04.532 --> 00:17:07.372]  And I know exactly what's doing it, of course.
[00:17:07.492 --> 00:17:13.893]  One of the main causes is the vaccines that they're giving them.
[00:17:13.973 --> 00:17:15.714]  Full of cancer viruses, that's admitted.
[00:17:16.334 --> 00:17:19.354]  And full of heavy metals that also cause cancer.
[00:17:19.775 --> 00:17:26.216]  And also their parents have been eating all this toxic food and breathing all this toxic air and drinking all this toxic water.
[00:17:26.256 --> 00:17:27.996]  So their DNA is all screwed up.
[00:17:28.076 --> 00:17:29.837]  They've done the sperm and egg test.
[00:17:30.277 --> 00:17:31.657]  They're completely toxified.
[00:17:32.839 --> 00:17:34.420]  In Europe, the sperm counts down by 80%.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.882]  It's down by, what, 74% here in the U.S.
[00:17:37.902 --> 00:17:38.982]  We're dying, people!
[00:17:39.922 --> 00:17:51.508]  I mean, on my little street that probably had, I don't know, 30 houses on it, two of the families that have children, they died of cancers.
[00:17:51.548 --> 00:17:53.029]  They died of brain cancers.
[00:17:53.109 --> 00:17:54.269]  Oh, I forgot to add that.
[00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:57.811]  And I wanted to pray for that child.
[00:17:57.831 --> 00:18:01.253]  I was praying for that child, but I just...
[00:18:02.541 --> 00:18:08.167]  I've never felt the spirit of God, of Yahweh, like I did, and I didn't do what I was supposed to.
[00:18:08.267 --> 00:18:10.269]  I wanted to go over, talk to that family.
[00:18:10.349 --> 00:18:12.632]  I wanted to lay hands on that child.
[00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:14.313]  Folks, you know I've never talked like this.
[00:18:14.393 --> 00:18:16.255]  It was the strongest urge I've ever had.
[00:18:16.275 --> 00:18:20.740]  I wanted to put my hands on his head and just pray for him and ask God to heal him.
[00:18:32.608 --> 00:18:35.410]  The Beast is killing our children!
[00:18:37.291 --> 00:18:38.891]  The Beast!
[00:18:40.272 --> 00:18:42.453]  The Beast is upon us!
[00:18:42.733 --> 00:18:43.774]  Oh God!
[00:18:46.515 --> 00:18:48.757]  It's gonna get worse and worse!
[00:18:51.418 --> 00:18:52.639]  They love death!
[00:18:52.699 --> 00:18:54.400]  They come to kill!
[00:18:56.621 --> 00:18:57.801]  They are killing!
[00:18:59.923 --> 00:19:00.463]  I'm sorry.
[00:19:02.472 --> 00:19:07.014]  I guess the New World Order's gotta be defeated!
[00:19:07.034 --> 00:19:08.314]  Oh God!
[00:19:08.354 --> 00:19:12.016]  Please God, please protect us from the New World Order!
[00:19:12.696 --> 00:19:14.757]  Please protect the children!
[00:19:14.977 --> 00:19:16.118]  Oh God!
[00:19:16.138 --> 00:19:16.938]  Oh God!
[00:19:17.118 --> 00:19:17.878]  Oh God!
[00:19:17.898 --> 00:19:19.159]  No!
[00:19:25.563 --> 00:19:27.645]  Does Stephanie play renegades or something?
[00:19:27.905 --> 00:19:29.387]  I gotta get myself together.
[00:19:29.427 --> 00:19:30.407]  We'll come back.
[00:19:30.968 --> 00:19:32.669]  I'm sick of chronicling their evil!
[00:19:38.695 --> 00:19:38.775]  Yeah.
[00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:02.591]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:20:02.771 --> 00:20:03.892]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:20:04.072 --> 00:20:07.494]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:20:07.614 --> 00:20:08.034]  Phenol?
[00:20:08.354 --> 00:20:15.458]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:20:15.758 --> 00:20:19.840]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:20.441]  Fragrance?
[00:20:20.801 --> 00:20:25.583]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:20:25.703 --> 00:20:30.306]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[00:20:30.606 --> 00:20:33.168]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my CalBen shampoo.
[00:20:33.408 --> 00:20:36.830]  Well, like all of the products from the CalBen Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:40.553]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:20:40.733 --> 00:20:43.094]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:20:43.255 --> 00:20:44.135]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:21:01.266 --> 00:21:09.890]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:21.396]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:21:21.616 --> 00:21:24.237]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:21:24.597 --> 00:21:31.061]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:21:31.221 --> 00:21:33.082]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:21:33.283 --> 00:21:39.306]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:21:39.566 --> 00:21:45.230]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[00:21:50.233 --> 00:21:50.914]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:01.207 --> 00:22:07.412]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:07.872 --> 00:22:15.638]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:15.999 --> 00:22:23.845]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:24.145 --> 00:22:28.906]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:29.246 --> 00:22:33.927]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:34.467 --> 00:22:38.308]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:38.808 --> 00:22:39.828]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:39.888 --> 00:22:43.989]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:22:44.409 --> 00:22:48.789]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:51.810]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:54.851]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:56.192 --> 00:22:57.953]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.794 --> 00:23:05.157]  Most of us have had a cafe we frequented because the service was so wonderful or the food was so great.
[00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:12.360]  The Silver Bear Cafe understands this philosophy and has incorporated these ideals into a website that offers food for thought to nourish the mind.
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:19.544]  Membership in the bear consists of a large and growing group of patriots who, like you, realize there are things in this great country that need changing right away.
[00:23:19.864 --> 00:23:27.371]  The Silver Bear Cafe provides you with an income opportunity that will provide you and your family with an ongoing revenue stream in return for simply spreading the message.
[00:23:27.771 --> 00:23:33.716]  So many of you have been trying to get the message out individually, but collectively our voices are strong and cannot be silenced.
[00:23:34.136 --> 00:23:36.779]  Membership in the bear will teach you the secrets of financial freedom.
[00:23:37.039 --> 00:23:43.486]  While the runaway government is crushing the American dream, why wars are played out across the globe, the fractional reserve system, etc.
[00:23:43.706 --> 00:23:46.369]  Where we're headed and what you can do to prepare yourself.
[00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:47.791]  Knowledge is power.
[00:23:48.031 --> 00:23:52.937]  Feed your mind and feed your financial independence with a visit to SilverBearCafe.com.
[00:23:53.097 --> 00:23:55.159]  That's SilverBearCafe.com.
[00:23:55.299 --> 00:23:58.483]  Do it today and preserve this country's greatness for generations to come.
[00:24:36.796 --> 00:24:42.477]  And I'll never back down.
[00:24:43.778 --> 00:24:45.578]  Because I know the New World Order is evil.
[00:24:45.598 --> 00:24:48.019]  I know they have wickedness as their intent.
[00:24:48.039 --> 00:24:49.839]  Dehumanization as their goal.
[00:24:50.579 --> 00:24:52.300]  We must defeat them with God's help.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.820]  You know, I went back to that place.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.921]  I'm sorry, I've never done that on the air.
[00:24:56.581 --> 00:24:59.202]  I went back to that place that I was yesterday.
[00:25:00.507 --> 00:25:08.152]  And that child, so sick, with cancer, just, just, just melted my heart.
[00:25:09.073 --> 00:25:11.915]  And as Americans, we have hard, hard hearts.
[00:25:14.116 --> 00:25:15.197]  Very hard hearts.
[00:25:15.517 --> 00:25:16.578]  More and more of us do.
[00:25:16.618 --> 00:25:17.518]  Very self-centered.
[00:25:20.666 --> 00:25:45.517]  When I think about what the New World Order is doing to children all over the planet, you know, when I see an old person driving over here, I saw an old person barely able to walk, very sick, with their, you know, old children helping them into a car, you know, it's sad, but they've lived their life, and that's part of the scope of things, and that's how it's supposed to work, and that doesn't, that doesn't sadden me one millionth
[00:25:46.207 --> 00:25:53.292]  Like it does to see the innocents, the children, people who have their whole lives before them being destroyed by this system.
[00:25:54.293 --> 00:25:55.454]  And it's a thousand thoughts.
[00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:57.195]  I can't put it in words.
[00:25:58.196 --> 00:25:59.777]  And you know, I talked about having a hard heart.
[00:25:59.797 --> 00:26:02.278]  I remember the three summers I worked for a large animal vet.
[00:26:02.298 --> 00:26:05.000]  You know, we did a lot of good.
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:07.702]  We saved a lot of cows and calves and horses.
[00:26:09.043 --> 00:26:10.965]  But also we did a lot of industrial work.
[00:26:11.025 --> 00:26:13.086]  You know, we'd go out and there'd be 500, 600 head of cattle.
[00:26:13.106 --> 00:26:15.568]  There'd be a couple cowboys, myself and the vet.
[00:26:16.471 --> 00:26:25.618]  And we'd run them into the chutes and we'd put the nose tongs in them and use the electric D-Horner on them and brand them.
[00:26:27.439 --> 00:26:29.421]  I don't even know if I could do that today.
[00:26:30.362 --> 00:26:34.845]  Call me a wimp, but I guess I've gone to the other extreme of having a soft heart.
[00:26:35.926 --> 00:26:37.827]  But you've got to have a soft heart.
[00:26:37.847 --> 00:26:42.071]  The New World Order has a black heart of obsidian.
[00:26:42.091 --> 00:26:43.932]  Of black stone, my friends.
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:55.222]  I just, you're not normal though if you don't have pain and if you're not concerned about evil and what's happening to the innocents.
[00:26:55.322 --> 00:27:08.244]  Christ said that, suffer the little children because you know these are the most dear to me and it would be better for you to tie a millstone around your neck, a boulder around your neck and throw yourself in the deepest sea than to hurt one of these.
[00:27:08.965 --> 00:27:11.205]  And that's what our society targets is the weak.
[00:27:12.082 --> 00:27:23.631]  It targets the old, it targets the young, it targets those that don't know, that haven't had time to learn, it twists society, it blackens our hearts, and I'm so sad for this country.
[00:27:24.551 --> 00:27:30.496]  This morning I was on the Statesman and they have a big banner on the local paper and it says, no shots, no school.
[00:27:31.969 --> 00:27:34.790]  And they lie in all these articles and say you've got to take it.
[00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:36.251]  You've got to take the shots.
[00:27:36.311 --> 00:27:37.151]  It's all over TV.
[00:27:37.191 --> 00:27:38.732]  It's all over TV nationally.
[00:27:38.752 --> 00:27:42.114]  They have the same federal program to put these vaccines in them.
[00:27:42.134 --> 00:27:45.235]  And Dr. Geyer, the congressional researcher, has tested the new vaccines.
[00:27:45.275 --> 00:27:46.515]  They haven't taken the mercury out.
[00:27:46.956 --> 00:27:49.077]  In fact, in many cases, they've radically increased it.
[00:27:50.097 --> 00:27:52.618]  Oh, we learn it's killing us and brain damaging our children?
[00:27:52.878 --> 00:27:54.699]  Why, they'll just increase it on us.
[00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:56.540]  And, uh,
[00:27:57.563 --> 00:28:09.432]  We've got Bob Dacey, a local TV host, a good friend of mine, who's been researching this and fighting it and exposing it in the States and finally had to admit it wasn't the law that you had to, but... You know, this is the kind of stuff we deal with on a daily basis.
[00:28:09.792 --> 00:28:23.622]  And to watch these psychopathic, demonic killers putting in the giant cage around us and building this society of control and preparing it is disgusting.
[00:28:23.642 --> 00:28:24.703]  It infuriates me.
[00:28:25.784 --> 00:28:34.768]  But if I was just hateful and hated the New World Order, I couldn't continue and work 16, 17, 18 hours a day like I do on a regular basis.
[00:28:35.848 --> 00:28:39.349]  No, love is what fuels me and what powers me.
[00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:41.810]  And we have to have love of our families.
[00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:46.032]  I mean, who wouldn't throw themselves in front of a bus to save their children?
[00:28:46.946 --> 00:28:52.667]  Well, we've got to get to the point where we throw ourselves in front of a bus to save our neighbor's children, or to save our neighbor.
[00:28:53.108 --> 00:29:00.850]  And when we get back to that attitude, and when that becomes the predominant spirit of America, we will have freedom again, and we will have prosperity.
[00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:13.813]  But we're going to lose it all, my friends, if we do not stand up boldly against this system and have the courage, the moral courage, the spiritual courage, to admit just how bad things have gotten.
[00:29:15.783 --> 00:29:24.468]  So that's my sermon today and I just am stricken to the core with what's happening.
[00:29:25.108 --> 00:29:26.189]  But it gives me strength.
[00:29:26.949 --> 00:29:32.912]  At the same time that it weakens me, then in the next moment it strengthens me.
[00:29:32.932 --> 00:29:40.196]  And I want to thank God for that and ask God to use me as a vessel and to use you as a vessel against this criminal system.
[00:29:41.235 --> 00:29:44.717]  Because we're the cellular level of the body politic in society.
[00:29:45.397 --> 00:29:48.378]  And we've become evil, and that's why evil's taken over.
[00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:52.060]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.181]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.062 --> 00:29:57.743]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:02.771]  It's finally here!
[00:30:02.911 --> 00:30:03.912]  Spring has arrived!
[00:30:04.092 --> 00:30:07.055]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:30:07.275 --> 00:30:10.738]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:30:10.938 --> 00:30:19.105]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:30:19.365 --> 00:30:23.108]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[00:30:23.309 --> 00:30:28.333]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[00:30:28.593 --> 00:30:33.119]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[00:30:33.299 --> 00:30:37.364]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[00:30:37.444 --> 00:30:44.633]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[00:30:44.893 --> 00:30:46.075]  Save money, eat healthy.
[00:30:46.135 --> 00:30:46.735]  We're good to go.
[00:31:01.118 --> 00:31:08.643]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:31:08.903 --> 00:31:19.831]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:31:20.031 --> 00:31:20.492]  We're good to go!
[00:31:36.568 --> 00:31:37.069]  That's right!
[00:31:37.249 --> 00:31:44.374]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:31:44.655 --> 00:31:48.778]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[00:31:48.958 --> 00:31:53.402]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:31:54.142 --> 00:31:54.963]  Attention pet owners!
[00:31:54.983 --> 00:31:58.486]  How would you like your dog or cat to behave instantly on command?

[00:32:19.845 --> 00:32:21.686]  Say your dog jumps on your best furniture.
[00:32:21.967 --> 00:32:23.668]  Just press the button to emit the sound.
[00:32:23.928 --> 00:32:26.391]  As he snaps to attention, give the command to get down.
[00:32:26.811 --> 00:32:29.874]  As soon as he obeys, praise him for the good behavior and that's it.
[00:32:30.254 --> 00:32:33.636]  Veterinarian-endorsed, Pet Trainer is the humane way to train pets.
[00:32:33.936 --> 00:32:37.838]  Whether it's non-stop barking, chewing shoes, pestering house guests, you name it.

[00:32:51.844 --> 00:32:52.104]  That's 1-800-851-5511.
[00:32:52.124 --> 00:32:52.344]  Call 1-800-851-5511.
[00:33:10.621 --> 00:33:14.162]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:33:14.702 --> 00:33:16.442]  Going out on the AM and FM dial.
[00:33:17.723 --> 00:33:21.404]  From Ohio to Texas, from California to Florida.
[00:33:22.044 --> 00:33:27.385]  Simulcasting on the Global Shortwave during the day at 9475 and at night from 9 to midnight at 3210.
[00:33:28.526 --> 00:33:31.347]  And of course at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:33:31.387 --> 00:33:32.747]  I know we have Robert and Ron and
[00:33:34.085 --> 00:33:37.506]  Is it Darren and Malta and Barney and others?
[00:33:38.746 --> 00:33:39.707]  We'll get to everybody.
[00:33:40.547 --> 00:33:45.469]  We just got Bob Dacey on from his gun shop and hardware store for about 15 minutes.
[00:33:45.489 --> 00:33:54.671]  I wanted to get Bob on because we posted the federal law, the state laws, the waivers, you don't have to take vaccines.
[00:33:55.352 --> 00:33:59.393]  Every school administrator knows this, every principal, every school nurse knows this.
[00:34:01.312 --> 00:34:12.036]  They have the form, but all over the country, every day I see news articles leading up to the start of school, that started in different areas of the country last week and this week, saying, no shots, no school, no shots, no school.
[00:34:12.417 --> 00:34:13.357]  This slogan.
[00:34:14.257 --> 00:34:21.640]  And they say it's the law, you have to, you have to go to the sports stadium and get your shots, because tens of thousands here in Austin had refused and they were panicking.
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:22.941]  So they lied about it.
[00:34:24.942 --> 00:34:30.844]  We even had to get a law passed in the last legislative session, saying that there is no law that you have to, reaffirming that.
[00:34:32.036 --> 00:34:32.756]  Just incredible.
[00:34:33.697 --> 00:34:34.777]  And then I found an article.
[00:34:34.837 --> 00:34:36.358]  The Statesman has this big banner up.
[00:34:36.378 --> 00:34:37.838]  The Austin, TX Statesman on their website.
[00:34:37.878 --> 00:34:39.219]  It says, no shots, no school.
[00:34:39.579 --> 00:34:42.340]  And it links to an old article, since they quietly retracted it.
[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:43.881]  They're still posting the old lies.
[00:34:44.641 --> 00:34:50.603]  And it says, district launches campaign now to be sure parents know that all students must be immunized before school year begins in the fall.
[00:34:51.203 --> 00:34:52.944]  And it goes on to say, you've got to.
[00:34:53.024 --> 00:34:58.306]  It says 18,000 students showed up on the first day without their shots.
[00:34:59.176 --> 00:35:04.299]  A number of the district whittled down to 7,000 by sending letters to parents and holding free shot clinics.
[00:35:05.419 --> 00:35:08.020]  And it says that at the start of this year's, it was 19,000.
[00:35:09.001 --> 00:35:13.063]  And by the way, by intimidation, they got it down to about 4,000 that refused.
[00:35:14.624 --> 00:35:15.344]  Just amazing.
[00:35:15.884 --> 00:35:26.970]  Bob, this story is so indicative of the premeditated lying, because I've seen articles that are almost identical, coast to coast, from newspapers and TV stations,
[00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:32.261]  Well, you know, I covered this on my TV show about three weeks ago.
[00:35:52.026 --> 00:35:52.767]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:36:14.262 --> 00:36:16.764]  The immunizations are required by the state.
[00:36:17.124 --> 00:36:20.907]  If you don't have your shots, we can't let you start school.
[00:36:21.428 --> 00:36:27.493]  Under state law, each student must be current with his or her immunization requirements before starting school.
[00:36:28.114 --> 00:36:31.937]  Students without all their shots won't be able to attend class.
[00:36:32.398 --> 00:36:34.780]  We don't have any choice in this.
[00:36:37.294 --> 00:36:45.818]  Bob, it's illegal for me to set up a toll road and drive around in a fake cop car and demand tolls from people.
[00:36:46.118 --> 00:36:46.898]  That's a felony.
[00:36:47.298 --> 00:36:52.841]  This is a crime they're committing, knowingly saying you have to do it when they know good and well there's never been a law.
[00:36:53.234 --> 00:36:56.699]  Well, you know, I was trying to figure this out because I knew it wasn't the law.
[00:36:56.799 --> 00:37:06.051]  And so, Forgione, the top guy in the school district, is telling me... And then he had a commercial on TV saying the same thing all over television, saying you had to do this.
[00:37:06.592 --> 00:37:10.858]  And, of course, then I went to the Texas Department of Health on their website.
[00:37:11.545 --> 00:37:14.306]  And read the law that says you don't have to.
[00:37:14.386 --> 00:37:15.527]  I mean, it's right here.
[00:37:15.747 --> 00:37:24.631]  Chapter 97.62 of the Texas Administrative Code describes the conditions under which individuals can seek exemptions from Texas immunization requirements.
[00:37:25.111 --> 00:37:32.634]  And they say you can do it for medical contraindications, reasons of conscience, including a religious belief, etc., etc.
[00:37:33.195 --> 00:37:36.436]  And so, you know, obviously they're saying, okay, well, let's show this to the people.
[00:37:36.636 --> 00:37:40.358]  They even have a sample letter you can send to the Department of Health requesting the form.
[00:37:40.953 --> 00:37:48.556]  Well, I'm trying to figure out why the top guy in the AISD is sitting out there lying to everybody and his brother
[00:38:01.013 --> 00:38:20.625]  In the paper and on television, and then the American Statesman, our local newspaper, puts an editorial in the paper a few days later, quoting Forgione, let me quote this, aside from abiding by dress codes, students must be current with required immunizations.
[00:38:21.187 --> 00:38:28.193]  As Forgione stated on these pages earlier this month, quote, if you don't have your shots, we can't let you start school, end quote.
[00:38:28.494 --> 00:38:33.998]  That's not a district rule, but a state law, and it goes for all students in every district.
[00:38:34.239 --> 00:38:38.783]  Now that's right out of that Austin American Spaceman, just, just, prompting this lie!
[00:38:38.963 --> 00:38:42.846]  They should be, they should, no, no, this is a public health issue, they should be arrested.
[00:38:43.126 --> 00:38:45.889]  Well, there's something wrong here, I mean, they should- No, I'm serious, they should be arrested!
[00:38:46.471 --> 00:38:47.712]  Well, I don't know.
[00:38:47.732 --> 00:38:49.193]  They did a few days later.
[00:38:49.393 --> 00:38:51.855]  After the TV shows and after we talked about it.
[00:38:51.895 --> 00:39:01.462]  They printed something in the paper where the headline said you had to get your shot, but then they had a one-liner in there a few days later saying that you could get an exemption.
[00:39:01.482 --> 00:39:01.802]  They did.
[00:39:02.242 --> 00:39:06.228]  A few days later, stick it in there, although the head might... The law doesn't even say you have to.
[00:39:06.828 --> 00:39:08.611]  Again, it's not even a law.
[00:39:08.671 --> 00:39:10.733]  It's a regulation that says you don't have to.
[00:39:11.014 --> 00:39:19.445]  You've never had to, and we got a law passed last year by the legislature that Perry did sign, one of the good things he did, saying, look,
[00:39:19.989 --> 00:39:27.573]  You have to stop taking people's children, you have to stop barring them from school, and then indicting them for truancy when you don't let them in school for not having shots.
[00:39:28.134 --> 00:39:34.197]  They had to pass a law saying there is no law that you have to, pointing at the other law, and they knew that.
[00:39:35.118 --> 00:39:37.219]  And by the way, Bob, this is nationwide.
[00:39:37.659 --> 00:39:43.603]  Every day I see articles in every state all over the country where the exact same things are being said.
[00:39:43.723 --> 00:39:46.044]  Well, my question to you, Alex, is you're the expert on this.
[00:39:46.144 --> 00:39:48.946]  I haven't studied the immunization thing nearly as much as you have.
[00:39:49.406 --> 00:39:50.990]  Why are they doing this?
[00:39:51.692 --> 00:39:56.101]  Well, for the locals, they don't get their federal funds unless 99% are vaccinated.
[00:39:57.558 --> 00:40:02.621]  And it's in the millions of dollars per school district, in big school districts, hundreds of thousands for small school districts.
[00:40:02.901 --> 00:40:04.502]  That's why they're doing it, to get money.
[00:40:04.862 --> 00:40:10.285]  But the feds are doing it because they want more learning disabilities, they want to dumb down people.
[00:40:10.305 --> 00:40:14.668]  It's just like Brave New World, which all came out of UNESCO plans, according to Huxley himself.
[00:40:15.408 --> 00:40:17.129]  It is to brain damage children.
[00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:20.091]  I mean, it sounds insane, but it's true.
[00:40:20.631 --> 00:40:22.212]  It is a eugenics program.
[00:40:23.263 --> 00:40:26.264]  Where can you go to get some documentation for that, Alex?
[00:40:26.804 --> 00:40:37.445]  On PrisonPlanet.com, we have a giant section with mainstream news where the CDC admitted it's brain damaging, but said they're going to continue admitting what the mercury does.
[00:40:37.966 --> 00:40:41.906]  And then we've caught the UN doing it in Africa and Asia purposefully.
[00:40:42.386 --> 00:40:45.647]  We've got Henry Kissinger documents going back to 1973 covering it.
[00:40:45.947 --> 00:40:48.227]  Sterilization hormones added to the vaccines.
[00:40:48.547 --> 00:40:49.868]  Brain damaging chemicals.
[00:40:50.248 --> 00:40:51.808]  It's being done as a eugenics program.
[00:40:52.128 --> 00:40:54.349]  Yeah, I'm aware of the U.N.
[00:40:54.869 --> 00:40:57.991]  sterilizing women without their consent through the vaccine programs.
[00:40:58.031 --> 00:40:59.131]  I'm aware of that.
[00:41:00.632 --> 00:41:02.993]  They also add chemicals to brain damage.
[00:41:03.293 --> 00:41:03.933]  Oh, how lovely.
[00:41:03.973 --> 00:41:04.733]  Well, that's the U.N.
[00:41:04.753 --> 00:41:05.013]  for you.
[00:41:05.033 --> 00:41:08.495]  They want to eliminate 80 to 90 percent of us, I guess, and they're going to start with Africa, huh?
[00:41:09.871 --> 00:41:10.251]  Yes, sir.
[00:41:10.291 --> 00:41:12.693]  But the same programs are being done here.
[00:41:12.753 --> 00:41:14.514]  I mean, look at all the eugenics that's happened here.
[00:41:14.594 --> 00:41:16.775]  But clearly, that's what's happening, Bob.
[00:41:16.835 --> 00:41:19.277]  The question is, do we have the courage to admit it to ourselves?
[00:41:19.637 --> 00:41:22.239]  Bob, what do you do about a disappearance?
[00:41:22.599 --> 00:41:23.419]  I mean, what do you do?
[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:32.445]  Well, I think we should write letters to the editor and say, no matter what newspaper is doing around the country, and ask them, what is their major malfunction?
[00:41:33.252 --> 00:41:41.396]  And I guess with it, in the letter to the editor, give the state code with the exemption and say there's not a law you have to do this.
[00:41:42.997 --> 00:41:53.383]  And then find the other code for your state that shows holding out with false arrest and what happens when you claim laws that don't exist and falsely prosecute people, which they're doing.
[00:41:54.243 --> 00:41:55.604]  Well, I hope somebody picks up that bet.
[00:41:55.644 --> 00:41:59.846]  I know that Mike Hanson was watching my show when I covered this three weeks ago.
[00:42:00.629 --> 00:42:06.753]  And he called me up and told me he called down to the AISD as a result of that and screamed bloody murder at him.
[00:42:07.493 --> 00:42:11.135]  And apparently somebody down there said, oh well, we'll fix it.
[00:42:11.696 --> 00:42:12.596]  But I don't think they did.
[00:42:13.116 --> 00:42:15.038]  No, they're still on TV, still on the paper.
[00:42:15.058 --> 00:42:16.438]  Yeah, they're still on TV doing the same thing.
[00:42:16.458 --> 00:42:19.860]  So, you know, I tell you, it's bold, isn't it, Alex?
[00:42:20.581 --> 00:42:22.682]  For me, you know, I'm a real simple guy.
[00:42:22.702 --> 00:42:29.206]  I cannot understand for a lot of me why our officials and our top guys and whatnot, why can't they just tell the truth?
[00:42:30.174 --> 00:42:30.834]  What's so hard?
[00:42:33.696 --> 00:42:40.960]  Bob, again, we've got the different laws posted on the website, but I told my webmaster to post the other ones.
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:45.322]  Bob, I know you're at work, but let me write that down and I'll
[00:42:46.771 --> 00:42:54.658]  Can you email me, it's in the archives somewhere, the laws, the name of the laws that you don't have to, but I need to get the actual code number.
[00:42:54.958 --> 00:42:58.941]  Will you email over to, do you know my secret email address?
[00:42:58.961 --> 00:43:03.705]  No, I don't, but I can fax you this Texas Department of Health website front page.
[00:43:04.644 --> 00:43:13.650]  Yeah, well just for the listeners, because I didn't have time to print this out this morning, why don't you give them the code again and then give them the website for the Texas Department of Health.
[00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:23.116]  This is the Texas Department of Health under the topic Exclusions from Immunization Requirements, Immunization Division.
[00:43:23.737 --> 00:43:28.239]  The webpage is www.tdh.state.tx.usd.gov.
[00:43:33.107 --> 00:43:33.367]  Yeah.
[00:43:47.759 --> 00:43:48.660]  It's not hard to find.
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:54.082]  It's chapter 97.62 of the Texas Administrative Code.
[00:43:54.903 --> 00:43:56.864]  And it's not hard to find.
[00:43:56.924 --> 00:43:58.305]  I mean, it's there.
[00:43:58.325 --> 00:43:59.245]  They show you the page.
[00:43:59.305 --> 00:44:00.926]  They show you how to get... No, I know.
[00:44:01.026 --> 00:44:02.547]  I've gotten copies of it.
[00:44:02.567 --> 00:44:03.787]  It's somewhere in the stack.
[00:44:03.807 --> 00:44:07.229]  And we've shown it on TV the last four weeks as they were doing this.
[00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:08.610]  I've been covering it on television.
[00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:10.611]  We've aired a little clip of the newscast.
[00:44:11.613 --> 00:44:18.507]  On one of last week's reports, it's on PrisonPlanet.tv, where they said, no shots, no school, it's the law.
[00:44:19.213 --> 00:44:21.454]  And then went on to say how you're a criminal if you don't do it.
[00:44:21.494 --> 00:44:28.798]  Well, you know, Forgione had that silly little basketball commercial where the kid's on the court and the coach orders him off.
[00:44:28.818 --> 00:44:30.399]  The court says he hasn't got his shots yet.
[00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:34.882]  Then Forgione himself appears there and says, you know, hey, the shot clock is running out.
[00:44:35.022 --> 00:44:36.043]  No shots, no school.
[00:44:36.083 --> 00:44:37.403]  And he throws the basket and he makes it.
[00:44:37.423 --> 00:44:39.985]  You know, I mean, that's the, I played that on my show.
[00:44:40.045 --> 00:44:43.927]  You know, it's no better documentation from that other guy's own mouth, right?
[00:44:45.885 --> 00:44:47.567]  It's premeditated evil.
[00:44:47.888 --> 00:44:49.109]  Government's gone bad.
[00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:50.471]  We're in tyranny again.
[00:44:50.491 --> 00:45:02.827]  And they're coming out and saying the national and state guards for martial law and arrest and I've got articles from all over the country where quote they're going to deal with riots and they're ready for it.
[00:45:02.888 --> 00:45:03.088]  I mean
[00:45:04.207 --> 00:45:05.789]  It's just, come on people!
[00:45:05.869 --> 00:45:10.656]  And look, there's no law that you have to take shots until two years ago when they passed Homeland Security.
[00:45:11.016 --> 00:45:14.181]  And under their emergencies, they can force any shots they want on you.
[00:45:14.641 --> 00:45:19.268]  That's on page 76 of the Homeland Security package.
[00:45:19.984 --> 00:45:25.648]  But they told their own police and firemen they had to take it and 99% said no according to the LA Times.
[00:45:25.688 --> 00:45:27.809]  So their own enforcers are saying no.
[00:45:28.169 --> 00:45:32.152]  That's why they're panicking and using such desperate methods, Bob.
[00:45:32.512 --> 00:45:35.975]  And that's why they want to shut down our local access television so we can't warn the people.
[00:45:36.555 --> 00:45:40.678]  Yeah, that's another issue that gets on the front burner once again.
[00:45:40.698 --> 00:45:42.199]  I don't know, Alex.
[00:45:42.419 --> 00:45:45.861]  It's coming at us from all fronts and we've got to resist it on all fronts.
[00:45:46.787 --> 00:45:49.711]  Alright, Bob Dacey, thank you for coming on.
[00:45:49.751 --> 00:45:51.072]  Sure, thank you Alex.
[00:45:51.113 --> 00:45:57.641]  Tell folks about your gun shop slash book store slash hardware store up in North Austin.
[00:45:57.661 --> 00:46:00.865]  Well, I have a true value hardware store up in Northwest Austin.
[00:46:00.885 --> 00:46:02.447]  It's called the Hardware Store Incorporated.
[00:46:03.078 --> 00:46:03.979]  You know, I do everything.
[00:46:04.019 --> 00:46:04.719]  I make screens.
[00:46:04.819 --> 00:46:05.700]  I sell guns.
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:06.821]  I do everything.
[00:46:06.861 --> 00:46:07.621]  I'm a locksmith.
[00:46:07.641 --> 00:46:08.422]  You name it, I do it.
[00:46:08.762 --> 00:46:11.084]  And I'm kind of like a jack of all trades.
[00:46:11.624 --> 00:46:15.246]  And another one of those evil right-wingers that works 12, 14-hour days.
[00:46:15.266 --> 00:46:17.748]  Yeah, I don't guess I get overtime, huh?
[00:46:17.888 --> 00:46:18.569]  Oh, well, whatever.
[00:46:19.169 --> 00:46:20.450]  That's just the way it works, huh?
[00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:24.433]  But I appreciate you coming on, Alex, and you keep up the good work, and you have a real good day.
[00:46:24.693 --> 00:46:25.454]  All right, my friend.
[00:46:25.494 --> 00:46:25.894]  Take care.
[00:46:25.914 --> 00:46:28.235]  All right, I want to thank the callers for holding.
[00:46:29.605 --> 00:46:33.988]  Earlier I had my little outburst about other killing children all over the planet and it hurts me.
[00:46:35.269 --> 00:46:40.853]  We got all this other news we're going to be covering here, but I mean there's no better illustration than this vaccine business.
[00:46:42.334 --> 00:46:43.374]  Oh, it's incredible.
[00:46:43.435 --> 00:46:45.836]  Robert in Colorado, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:46:45.876 --> 00:46:46.417]  First caller.
[00:46:47.657 --> 00:46:48.558]  Good morning Alex.
[00:46:48.638 --> 00:46:49.839]  Thank you very much for taking my call.
[00:46:49.859 --> 00:46:50.599]  I appreciate that.
[00:46:50.639 --> 00:46:51.180]  How are you today?
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:51.660]  Good.
[00:46:52.861 --> 00:46:57.684]  Listening to an archive show of Sally Bonteith yesterday, I heard you got a lady name.
[00:46:57.704 --> 00:46:58.685]  I think her name is Karen
[00:46:59.508 --> 00:46:59.868]  Holgate.
[00:47:00.549 --> 00:47:03.712]  He was talking about an initiative that's going through the California State Legislature.
[00:47:04.132 --> 00:47:05.594]  It kind of ties into vaccines in a way.
[00:47:05.974 --> 00:47:10.218]  They want to basically take over children in California from birth.
[00:47:10.378 --> 00:47:13.161]  They want to test them mentally, physically.
[00:47:13.301 --> 00:47:15.383]  Yeah, no, that's the New Freedom Initiative.
[00:47:15.703 --> 00:47:19.126]  Ten states are already doing it, including California.
[00:47:19.707 --> 00:47:21.729]  And psychiatric testing twice a year.
[00:47:21.789 --> 00:47:23.730]  It's going to start with the adults now in Illinois.
[00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:25.212]  We're all going to be prisoners.
[00:47:25.874 --> 00:47:30.515]  Yeah, it hasn't passed yet, but they're thinking that when it gets to Arnold's desk, he probably will sign off on it.
[00:47:30.595 --> 00:47:37.097]  And, interestingly enough, when the supporters are asked how they're going to pay for it, they kind of glaze over and they say, well, we'll just go to the taxpayers.
[00:47:37.677 --> 00:47:42.958]  Which, if you know anything about California, they're already taxed to the death as it is, so they won't lay another tax on them for that.
[00:47:42.978 --> 00:47:44.479]  So, I thought that was kind of interesting.
[00:47:44.759 --> 00:47:47.579]  Also listened to another show of Monteith's.
[00:47:47.659 --> 00:47:51.220]  I think the guy's name was John Stoner or Stormer.
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:54.061]  I believe he wrote Dare to Call It Treason.
[00:47:54.970 --> 00:48:04.216]  And during his show, he brought the interesting fact about a company from Hong Kong that recently bought out the bankrupt Global Crossing.
[00:48:04.757 --> 00:48:05.817]  And I remember reading about this.
[00:48:05.858 --> 00:48:06.678]  Your phone cut out.
[00:48:06.898 --> 00:48:08.199]  Bought out the bankrupt what?
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:09.620]  Global Crossing.
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:11.401]  Yes.
[00:48:11.481 --> 00:48:14.483]  I remember reading about this several months ago, but didn't make the connection.
[00:48:14.623 --> 00:48:19.547]  But apparently Global Crossing has microfiber optics around the globe.
[00:48:19.667 --> 00:48:21.088]  Yeah, it's all these giant
[00:48:21.713 --> 00:48:25.315]  Fiber optic cables strung across the oceans for communication.
[00:48:25.655 --> 00:48:33.299]  So if this company wanted to, the people from China, they could pretty much cripple our communications pretty easily with just one fell swoop.
[00:48:33.319 --> 00:48:34.560]  Just flipping a switch, that would do it.
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:38.922]  Yes, our infrastructure more and more is being tied to China.
[00:48:39.383 --> 00:48:39.863]  Yes, yes.
[00:48:40.023 --> 00:48:47.087]  Plus, as you mentioned a few weeks ago, they bought the Catamount Canal, which is a big shipping lane for goods that come and go through the U.S.
[00:48:47.127 --> 00:48:48.027]  Yeah, they got the lease.
[00:48:48.167 --> 00:48:49.208]  Hutchinson, Wampoa.
[00:48:49.668 --> 00:48:50.169]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:51.417 --> 00:48:59.984]  Dr. Monteith also mentioned they recently bought several American bonds, which if they start to sell, that could cause all kinds of financial upheaval in our country.
[00:49:01.566 --> 00:49:09.813]  All the Chinese have to do is up the value of their currency, and it will destroy our economy overnight.
[00:49:10.333 --> 00:49:11.434]  Yes, very easily.
[00:49:11.695 --> 00:49:13.036]  Anyway, thanks for your time, Alex.
[00:49:13.076 --> 00:49:13.716]  Keep up the good work.
[00:49:14.761 --> 00:49:15.021]  Thank you.
[00:49:15.041 --> 00:49:15.461]  See you later.
[00:49:15.721 --> 00:49:16.922]  Thank you for the call, Robert.
[00:49:17.402 --> 00:49:18.302]  Ron in New York.
[00:49:18.342 --> 00:49:18.942]  You're on the air.
[00:49:19.022 --> 00:49:19.442]  Go ahead.
[00:49:19.462 --> 00:49:20.402]  Hi, Alex.
[00:49:20.682 --> 00:49:20.963]  Hello.
[00:49:21.083 --> 00:49:41.287]  Alex, with reference to this upcoming Republican convention in New York City, I've been reading the papers, and as it approaches, closer and closer, the papers, and in particular, I noticed this past Sunday, the editorial section in the Post, and even in the Daily News, which likes to present itself as a so-called anti-establishment newspaper, but that's just a false alternative.
[00:49:41.447 --> 00:49:42.488]  They're in on it, too.
[00:49:44.349 --> 00:49:55.151]  Their editorials were actually crooning about the fact that you're going to have police with machine guns here and autotronic weapons to control any unruly crowds.
[00:49:55.811 --> 00:50:00.732]  They were actually applauding the fact that those type of weapons may be turned loose on our fellow citizens.
[00:50:00.832 --> 00:50:12.715]  I mean, this is all part of conditioning the mass of people, the ignorant mass, as you said, who are into materialism, they're selfish, into the idea that it's okay to turn
[00:50:13.263 --> 00:50:17.907]  Weapons, essentially weapons of mass destruction against innocent people, crowds of innocent people.
[00:50:17.927 --> 00:50:19.568]  They keep trying to prime everybody up.
[00:50:19.668 --> 00:50:25.973]  Yeah, giant sound wave weapons that burst your eardrums, and I'm going to be there covering it, Ron.
[00:50:26.293 --> 00:50:27.134]  You're going to be in New York?
[00:50:27.314 --> 00:50:27.474]  Yep.
[00:50:27.975 --> 00:50:29.075]  That's going to be very interesting.
[00:50:29.095 --> 00:50:33.319]  I hope you broadcast from a remote here, because that'll be one of the most interesting days, probably.
[00:50:33.339 --> 00:50:34.560]  Could you hold me over, Alex?
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:35.981]  Sure, I want to hear more about it.
[00:50:37.276 --> 00:50:38.077]  We'll come back.
[00:50:38.117 --> 00:50:40.119]  I've got some news on New York as well.
[00:50:40.159 --> 00:50:41.521]  They claim the Weathermen are back.
[00:50:41.581 --> 00:50:46.567]  Bush released them from prison and now they're working for their boss to create crises, according to the New York Post.
[00:50:47.528 --> 00:50:48.389]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:48.429 --> 00:50:50.651]  PrisonPlanet.tv, of course, is the website.
[00:50:50.691 --> 00:50:52.894]  And then we'll talk to everybody else as well at 800-259-9231.
[00:50:52.914 --> 00:50:53.314]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.181 --> 00:51:05.505]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.705 --> 00:51:10.130]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:14.634]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.674 --> 00:51:16.056]  The New World Order.
[00:51:16.776 --> 00:51:17.777]  Panama.
[00:51:17.818 --> 00:51:22.042]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.102 --> 00:51:29.050]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:31.173]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.533 --> 00:51:41.903]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:41.923 --> 00:51:47.448]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:51:48.028 --> 00:51:51.569]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:56.751]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:56.851 --> 00:51:58.291]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:58.651 --> 00:52:00.112]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:52:00.452 --> 00:52:02.433]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[00:52:02.513 --> 00:52:13.216]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:52:13.596 --> 00:52:18.118]  The Murky's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the white murky purification element.
[00:52:18.198 --> 00:52:29.523]  When used, water flow through the purification elements, where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:52:30.123 --> 00:52:36.968]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:52:37.368 --> 00:52:39.509]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:44.973]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.
[00:52:45.273 --> 00:52:51.417]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:51.437 --> 00:52:52.538]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:52:52.598 --> 00:52:53.239]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:52:59.923 --> 00:53:02.224]  We're good.
[00:53:17.393 --> 00:53:17.993]  I think so.
[00:53:39.967 --> 00:53:40.768]  We're good to go.
[00:54:11.368 --> 00:54:13.250]  Think about what America's turned into.
[00:54:13.310 --> 00:54:26.441]  Police in black ski masks, giant prisons, helicopters looking through our walls, sound wave weapons, police beating their batons on their shields, a few hired provocateurs always to create the crisis, to legitimize all of this.
[00:54:27.522 --> 00:54:29.864]  Ron in New York, the climate in New York.
[00:54:31.906 --> 00:54:35.249]  They said hundreds of thousands were going to show up in Boston, but only
[00:54:36.189 --> 00:54:38.110]  A few thousand did because of intimidation.
[00:54:38.410 --> 00:54:40.330]  Now they're saying 500,000 a million.
[00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:42.231]  What do you think the real numbers are?
[00:54:42.791 --> 00:54:50.893]  Well, in reality, it probably won't be 500,000 or a million because it is New York and it is a convention where you have the sitting president coming.
[00:54:51.293 --> 00:54:56.774]  It'll probably be more than Boston, but I don't think it'll reach the one million mark that they keep talking about.
[00:54:56.814 --> 00:55:00.015]  We went through this two years ago in New York with the G7 Summit.
[00:55:00.745 --> 00:55:06.909]  And they were priming everybody up for the, uh, telling them that, you know, we were going to have provocateurs come to town and so forth.
[00:55:07.450 --> 00:55:08.631]  And nothing like that happened.
[00:55:08.711 --> 00:55:13.634]  In fact, I was right down by the Waldorf Astoria Hotel where this G7 Summit was held.
[00:55:14.135 --> 00:55:15.436]  There were peaceful protesters.
[00:55:15.616 --> 00:55:16.577]  Nobody did anything.
[00:55:17.137 --> 00:55:28.165]  This time, I think, and this is why I think that, it was reported in Newsday newspaper about two weeks ago, that the police have already sent people to the meetings for various groups that want to protest.
[00:55:28.703 --> 00:55:38.799]  And they pose themselves as the most anti-Bush and virulent, uh, you know, I guess, uh, left-wing type of, of protesters, and they've, in fact, this was part of their policy, it was even admitted!
[00:55:39.505 --> 00:55:42.887]  That they went in and, you know, they tried to whip up these crowds.
[00:55:42.967 --> 00:55:48.909]  So with that kind of behavior, one begins to think maybe they will send agent provocateurs into the actual market.
[00:55:48.949 --> 00:55:49.330]  And they admit!
[00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:52.771]  I mean, in Austin we've had cops come into the crowds and try to start fights.
[00:55:53.111 --> 00:55:57.133]  I mean, our government wants to have violent protests so they can shut them down, folks!
[00:55:57.173 --> 00:55:59.854]  That's right, because it's pretexting, it's called.
[00:55:59.994 --> 00:56:03.336]  Create the problem and then criticize the problem you created.
[00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:06.100]  To then take more steps to deprive people of rights.
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:13.942]  Well, Bloomberg said it's a privilege to protest last week, and two weeks before that, he told New York police, if you protest, you may lose your job.
[00:56:13.982 --> 00:56:19.763]  So, the cops are being told they've lost their First Amendment, and you've called before your retired police officer.
[00:56:20.023 --> 00:56:22.384]  I mean, do you think these cops are happy with what they're doing?
[00:56:23.324 --> 00:56:29.726]  Um, I think that the, and I said this to you before, the older ones who come from the older morality in this country are not.
[00:56:29.906 --> 00:56:30.606]  The younger ones?
[00:56:31.306 --> 00:56:31.746]  Stupid.
[00:56:32.623 --> 00:56:33.824]  I'm morally ignorant.
[00:56:34.124 --> 00:56:36.366]  I think they call them moral imbeciles at Nuremberg.
[00:56:37.046 --> 00:56:37.967]  Moral imbeciles.
[00:56:38.027 --> 00:56:41.569]  The younger ones will go along with any absurdity, no matter how outrageous it is.
[00:56:41.669 --> 00:56:43.951]  The ones that are, let's say, over 35?
[00:56:44.672 --> 00:56:44.852]  No.
[00:56:44.932 --> 00:56:51.356]  They were raised in a different America, and they have a different value system, and whether they wear a uniform or not, these are not stormtroopers.
[00:56:51.836 --> 00:56:54.358]  The younger ones, I'm afraid I have very little faith in.
[00:56:54.478 --> 00:56:55.419]  I've spoken with them.
[00:56:55.499 --> 00:57:00.262]  Believe me, these guys are like drones or something out of a movie, or stormtroopers out of a movie.
[00:57:00.783 --> 00:57:01.103]  There's no
[00:57:01.798 --> 00:57:03.279]  In a core of morality in them.
[00:57:14.392 --> 00:57:18.656]  Before I end this hour, this broadcast is funded by your support.
[00:57:19.337 --> 00:57:20.558]  And I've made great films.
[00:57:20.618 --> 00:57:21.399]  I've made ten of them.
[00:57:21.479 --> 00:57:26.504]  I carry, I don't know, eight, nine other videos by Jews with Preservation of Firearms Ownership.
[00:57:26.764 --> 00:57:29.387]  Their film Innocence Portrayed comes with three free color booklets.
[00:57:29.687 --> 00:57:32.730]  When you order that on VHS or DVD about the history of gun control.
[00:57:33.090 --> 00:57:35.633]  George Humphrey's new video, 9-11, The Great Illusion.
[00:57:36.253 --> 00:57:38.653]  Endgame of the Illuminati on VHS and DVD.
[00:57:38.713 --> 00:57:41.794]  Comes with a free color booklet when you order that as well.
[00:57:42.674 --> 00:57:46.115]  My two 9-11 films, 9-11 The Road to Tyranny and The Masters of Terror.
[00:57:46.475 --> 00:57:50.616]  My film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove about the occult activities of the world elite.
[00:57:51.056 --> 00:57:53.756]  My videos are $25.95 because they're all over two hours.
[00:57:54.276 --> 00:57:57.577]  Some, like Police State 3 Total Enslavement are two hours, 44 minutes.
[00:57:57.897 --> 00:57:59.237]  Really three or four films in one.
[00:57:59.797 --> 00:58:03.178]  They're $25.95, but order three or more, they drop down to $20 a piece.
[00:58:04.699 --> 00:58:08.543]  So please get the videos, make copies of my films.
[00:58:08.603 --> 00:58:09.564]  I authorize you to do that.
[00:58:09.904 --> 00:58:10.825]  Get them out to people.
[00:58:11.306 --> 00:58:19.294]  Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to go to the SecureSafe shopping cart and watch video clips and read about the films or perhaps order them.
[00:58:20.195 --> 00:58:22.356]  Or the toll-free number to order, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:22.376 --> 00:58:22.736]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:58:22.776 --> 00:58:28.218]  Or PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com to order via the safe secure online shopping cart.
[00:58:28.598 --> 00:58:32.660]  So again folks, InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or 1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:34.820]  Second hour, your calls, ton of news, straight ahead, stay with us.
[00:58:57.409 --> 00:59:01.572]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.232 --> 00:59:03.073]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.833 --> 00:59:04.754]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.794 --> 00:59:09.016]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.577 --> 00:59:13.719]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:18.282]  Alright, my friends, into our number two.
[00:59:18.322 --> 00:59:20.083]  We'll get into the latest propaganda.
[00:59:20.123 --> 00:59:23.025]  CNN hijacker visa found in Flight 93 wreckage.
[00:59:25.174 --> 00:59:29.197]  Also, Rumsfeld to escape Abu Ghraib blame from the commission he appointed.
[00:59:30.698 --> 00:59:35.702]  Weatherman Terror Group back to wreak havoc in the RNC and Paul Watson wrote this comment.
[00:59:36.818 --> 00:59:48.646]  The Post stupidly gives away the Bush game plan, and these people were indeed recently released from the express purpose of assuming leadership of the anarchist government-paid agent provocateurs descending upon the GOP convention.
[00:59:48.946 --> 00:59:51.428]  Who else but the Justice Department could have authorized this action?
[00:59:51.888 --> 00:59:57.071]  Anyone who has been incarcerated for over 30 years must have been paroled on a capital offense.
[00:59:57.772 --> 01:00:00.614]  If this story has any merit, it is the Post, after all.
[01:00:00.954 --> 01:00:05.457]  The Bushies are releasing killers to wreak a Ken Steak-style massacre
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:09.282]  that the dutiful free press will blame on the anarchist.
[01:00:09.722 --> 01:00:22.071]  Rove is following the game plan of his protege, Nixon dirty trickster Donald Ceretti, to the T. I guess they'll say Therese Carey Hines is behind it all.
[01:00:23.172 --> 01:00:34.300]  And it says a number of extremists with ties to the 70s radical weathermen underground have recently been released from prison and are on their way to New York preparing to wreak havoc during the Republican National Convention, the Post has learned.
[01:00:34.853 --> 01:00:38.075]  You're a former police officer in New York, retired, Ron.
[01:00:38.095 --> 01:00:39.615]  I mean, how ridiculous is this?
[01:00:42.357 --> 01:00:43.037]  Ron in New York?
[01:00:43.057 --> 01:00:43.377]  Yeah, it is.
[01:00:43.457 --> 01:00:43.897]  Yes, I am.
[01:00:44.257 --> 01:00:44.598]  Go ahead.
[01:00:44.838 --> 01:00:46.358]  It is exactly what you said.
[01:00:46.398 --> 01:00:47.119]  It's ridiculous.
[01:00:47.179 --> 01:00:57.443]  It's inflammatory and it's an attempt by the part of mainstream or establishment media to try and set the stage to obtain a specific type of result.
[01:00:58.084 --> 01:01:00.605]  I believe you've got certain forces working in tandem here.
[01:01:01.129 --> 01:01:06.991]  In the hope that something negative and bad will happen, or could be agitated into happening, and then it could be seized upon.
[01:01:07.011 --> 01:01:29.038]  You know, something else I have to tell you and your audience is, I don't think most people realize this, that we are going to be under, essentially, what amounts to, it's tantamount, it's synonymous with martial law rules, because they have invoked what they call, as per the law in the Patriot Act, the standards for what is referred to as a national security event.
[01:01:29.864 --> 01:01:37.750]  Because they're holding the convention here, which of course is a largely ceremonial function, it's not even essential anymore to anybody that knows the political process.
[01:01:38.491 --> 01:01:41.373]  So, because it is a national security matter,
[01:01:41.866 --> 01:01:43.707]  It will trump all constitutional rights.
[01:01:43.967 --> 01:01:52.253]  And they're going to have police with loaded machine guns, not just the non-lethal or less than lethal weapons, the giant sound guns, all of it.
[01:01:52.413 --> 01:02:03.680]  All kinds of weapons, all kinds of weapons designed to, you know, the type of weapons they might have thought about using against an enemy or something in World War II, they're going to now have on the streets of New York City.
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:06.822]  Well, again, a year ago it's for Baghdad, now it's for America.
[01:02:07.223 --> 01:02:10.805]  Well, that's just about what it's come down to, and I'm surprised.
[01:02:11.488 --> 01:02:22.231]  I'm surprised that people aren't shocked and that they aren't upset with these newspapers for crooning about the fact that, you know, you're going to have weapons like this used against your fellow citizens and your neighbors.
[01:02:22.251 --> 01:02:22.811]  Well, take Boston.
[01:02:22.851 --> 01:02:25.132]  They had loaded M60s pointed at crowds.
[01:02:25.272 --> 01:02:27.833]  I mean... This is what they got here.
[01:02:28.173 --> 01:02:32.654]  Believe me, Alex, whatever they had in Boston was bad, and what they're moving in here is even worse.
[01:02:32.674 --> 01:02:35.015]  They're doing it on an even larger scale than they did in Boston.
[01:02:35.035 --> 01:02:37.636]  What is the 30,000-man Hercules team going to be doing?
[01:02:38.973 --> 01:02:40.494]  They've already started deploying them.
[01:02:40.634 --> 01:02:42.175]  You've got them all over the street.
[01:02:42.215 --> 01:02:44.136]  You have areas that will be isolated.
[01:02:44.196 --> 01:02:53.600]  They're walking around with fully automatic weapons, these autotronic weapons, which are supposed to be sound weapons for those in the audience that don't know, and all kinds of other stuff.
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:03:02.164]  Matter of fact, they are even employing, or probably will employ in like certain major train stations, devices which could be put in a rucksack.
[01:03:02.365 --> 01:03:03.145]  They're fairly small.
[01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:10.971]  And you could point them at somebody and essentially x-ray straight through their clothes and everything else right down to their skivvies to see if they got anything.
[01:03:11.431 --> 01:03:12.911]  I mean, this is what's being employed.
[01:03:13.392 --> 01:03:19.133]  Now, what gets me is this, and I have to say this, and I'm surprised that many of the groups that allegedly oppose this haven't brought it up.
[01:03:20.093 --> 01:03:26.595]  If they feel that this event is a beacon for so many evildoers and terrorists,
[01:03:27.048 --> 01:03:36.697]  Then why must we impose this unnecessary, purely ceremonial event and coronation upon the millions and millions of citizens in the city of New York?
[01:03:37.177 --> 01:03:38.458]  Why not hold it somewhere else?
[01:03:38.879 --> 01:03:39.399]  Cancel it?
[01:03:39.679 --> 01:03:41.000]  Reduce the number of days it should run?
[01:03:41.021 --> 01:03:42.822]  Well, this is all to train us how to be slaves.
[01:03:42.882 --> 01:03:44.684]  This is going to be life in everyday America.
[01:03:44.944 --> 01:03:46.025]  They're publicly announcing it.
[01:03:46.045 --> 01:03:47.666]  They're going to use the National Guard and State Guards.
[01:03:47.927 --> 01:03:48.527]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:48.567 --> 01:03:49.288]  More calls coming up.
[01:03:52.964 --> 01:03:59.809]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.110 --> 01:04:01.491]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:01.691 --> 01:04:03.913]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.053 --> 01:04:06.134]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:06.415 --> 01:04:11.358]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:11.679 --> 01:04:15.722]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:15.962 --> 01:04:17.743]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:17.823 --> 01:04:28.469]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.610 --> 01:04:30.511]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:04:30.711 --> 01:04:34.573]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns of the Info War.
[01:04:34.673 --> 01:04:36.234]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[01:04:36.254 --> 01:04:36.594]  That's 888-2533-139.
[01:04:43.158 --> 01:04:46.767]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[01:04:47.027 --> 01:04:47.729]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[01:04:53.467 --> 01:04:57.970]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:04:58.310 --> 01:05:02.413]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:05:02.693 --> 01:05:03.233]  We listened.
[01:05:03.553 --> 01:05:08.537]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:05:08.817 --> 01:05:09.297]  We listened.
[01:05:09.677 --> 01:05:12.719]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:13.680]  We listened.
[01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:18.183]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:05:18.643 --> 01:05:19.043]  We're good.
[01:05:43.559 --> 01:05:45.001]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[01:05:45.021 --> 01:05:46.202]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:52.435 --> 01:05:53.435]  It's finally here!
[01:05:53.575 --> 01:05:54.556]  Spring has arrived!
[01:05:54.736 --> 01:05:57.696]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:05:57.916 --> 01:06:01.377]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:06:01.597 --> 01:06:09.759]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[01:06:10.019 --> 01:06:13.740]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:18.961]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:23.764]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[01:06:23.944 --> 01:06:28.007]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[01:06:28.107 --> 01:06:35.232]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn!
[01:06:35.452 --> 01:06:35.792]  Big Brother.
[01:06:35.852 --> 01:06:36.453]  Mainstream media.
[01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:37.313]  Government cover-ups.
[01:06:37.333 --> 01:06:38.113]  You want answers?
[01:06:38.133 --> 01:06:38.714]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.527 --> 01:07:09.149]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:13.832]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.313 --> 01:07:23.939]  We've been talking about how the National Guard and the State Guard are publicly announcing that they're going to have martial law duties to, quote, oppress unrest.
[01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:30.023]  And they've been told to be activated by, in some states, November 1st, other states, October 1st.
[01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:39.595]  Also, we have the total police state with sound wave weapons, loaded machine guns, tanks, armored vehicles in New York City.
[01:07:40.236 --> 01:07:42.297]  The government's bringing in the provocateurs.
[01:07:43.438 --> 01:07:45.619]  We have the Najib situation over in Iraq.
[01:07:45.659 --> 01:07:49.322]  A lot of key info we're going to be talking about, but let's get a bunch of these calls out of the way quickly.
[01:07:50.142 --> 01:07:51.984]  Let's talk to Darren in Colorado.
[01:07:52.004 --> 01:07:52.544]  You're on the air.
[01:07:52.624 --> 01:07:53.264]  Thanks for holding.
[01:07:53.885 --> 01:07:55.006]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:07:55.206 --> 01:07:58.048]  I'd like to go back to your compassion at the beginning of the show.
[01:08:00.307 --> 01:08:04.431]  Way back in 1967, I was a boy watching the news with my dad.
[01:08:04.971 --> 01:08:07.914]  And the head of the CDC in Fort Collins went on TV.
[01:08:09.556 --> 01:08:14.580]  He said, yes, we gave the deer and the elk the disease and released them into the wild.
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.882]  The news correspondent was a young woman.
[01:08:16.942 --> 01:08:19.625]  She said, why don't you go and retrieve the deer and the elk you released?
[01:08:20.365 --> 01:08:22.588]  He said, I have not got the authority.
[01:08:23.328 --> 01:08:23.949]  And he was angry.
[01:08:25.299 --> 01:08:31.342]  You know, nothing ever happened to that, and now they're killing the deer and elk in multiple states, which is our food supply in a time of trouble.
[01:08:32.263 --> 01:08:33.343]  In our clothes, in our boots.
[01:08:33.803 --> 01:08:37.025]  Well, they developed the Lyme disease and released it from Plum Island.
[01:08:37.665 --> 01:08:42.848]  They released millions of mosquitoes, bred them in Canada, and brought them down here with all these diseases.
[01:08:42.908 --> 01:08:43.488]  Exactly.
[01:08:43.548 --> 01:08:48.931]  West Nile virus was released from the Maryland CDC, according to a Homeland Security supervisor I spoke to.
[01:08:49.716 --> 01:08:52.838]  Well, I'm going back decades with this, sir.
[01:08:52.878 --> 01:08:53.138]  Right.
[01:08:53.238 --> 01:09:03.485]  So, what it comes down to, though, is there's one other topic I'd like to hit once I place the cure in the middle, and that has to do with the cloud seeding contrails.
[01:09:03.845 --> 01:09:05.226]  But, let me give you the cure.
[01:09:05.246 --> 01:09:10.609]  That CDC official, I never considered my enemy because he wanted what was right.
[01:09:10.669 --> 01:09:17.894]  No different than the 99% of our FBI, CIA, ATF, but they're compromised because they have nowhere to turn.
[01:09:19.176 --> 01:09:20.977]  And the problem is, is us.
[01:09:21.258 --> 01:09:30.445]  If we point the finger at us, all of us in this nation and around the world, that when they went to work, they needed to know their family was safe at home.
[01:09:31.205 --> 01:09:40.272]  And it's our job to make a refuge for them that way by letting our neighbors know that if our government people are being compromised,
[01:09:41.072 --> 01:09:43.874]  We need to be the ref and we have to stand firm for our neighbors.
[01:10:11.482 --> 01:10:13.743]  To build these people a refuge door-to-door, house-to-house.
[01:10:13.823 --> 01:10:16.324]  And about the contrails, are you still there?
[01:10:16.724 --> 01:10:17.284]  Yes, I am.
[01:10:18.145 --> 01:10:23.007]  The contrails, I mentioned it after I did about three dozen hours of research on cloud seeding.
[01:10:23.887 --> 01:10:28.008]  Mentioned it to a guy, and he says, you know, they're causing the drought with the cloud seeding.
[01:10:28.028 --> 01:10:28.769]  He said, I know that.
[01:10:29.029 --> 01:10:30.109]  I said, how'd you find out?
[01:10:30.970 --> 01:10:34.291]  He said, I have a very good friend who's a meteorologist, sends up weather balloons and such.
[01:10:34.311 --> 01:10:37.332]  His friend told him they're causing this drought, and there's nothing I can do about it.
[01:10:40.290 --> 01:10:44.273]  That if you told me where the weather station was, I'd go out there and turn by the Department of Defense.
[01:10:45.114 --> 01:10:47.816]  But obviously, this fellow was disturbed greatly.
[01:10:48.357 --> 01:10:48.777]  And you know what?
[01:10:48.817 --> 01:10:58.204]  I hope all your listeners will help me to make sure that all these people who are in these services being forced to do against their will will one day have a refuge.
[01:10:58.224 --> 01:11:00.146]  So reach your neighbors and let them know you're here.
[01:11:00.206 --> 01:11:00.726]  I understand.
[01:11:00.827 --> 01:11:01.947]  Darren, thank you for the call.
[01:11:02.508 --> 01:11:03.188]  I appreciate it.
[01:11:03.649 --> 01:11:04.710]  Malta and Denmark.
[01:11:04.810 --> 01:11:05.771]  Malta, you're on the air.
[01:11:05.831 --> 01:11:06.231]  Go ahead.
[01:11:08.982 --> 01:11:10.443]  Welcome Malta and Denmark.
[01:11:10.463 --> 01:11:11.124]  You're on the air.
[01:11:11.144 --> 01:11:12.946]  Okay, we'll let him go.
[01:11:12.966 --> 01:11:14.847]  We're going to let him go now.
[01:11:14.888 --> 01:11:15.428]  He's not there.
[01:11:15.528 --> 01:11:16.889]  Let's talk to Barney in Maryland.
[01:11:16.909 --> 01:11:17.790]  Barney, you're on the air.
[01:11:17.850 --> 01:11:18.271]  Go ahead.
[01:11:18.471 --> 01:11:19.512]  Yeah, how you doing Alex?
[01:11:19.672 --> 01:11:19.932]  Good.
[01:11:20.873 --> 01:11:28.840]  Hey, I called in to remind you that Russia and probably the United States have Tesla's earthquake machine.
[01:11:29.741 --> 01:11:33.465]  And they might be using it over in Athens.
[01:11:34.375 --> 01:11:59.029]  Well, I don't, you know, I don't like to speculate, but for those that just joined us, there was a, I forget what, a 4.2 earthquake that hit Athens today, and certainly, sir, that's an earthquake-prone area, and earthquakes do naturally occur, but Secretary of Defense Cohen, back in 97, said, we have earthquake weapons, he said it on C-SPAN,
[01:11:59.796 --> 01:12:09.003]  And they admit they have systems that can cause earthquakes, and it's very, very serious, but I don't like to speculate and say that that's what's happened here.
[01:12:09.523 --> 01:12:16.689]  Well, the earthquake machine is very simple, and it's more dangerous than the atomic bomb, as far as I'm concerned.
[01:12:17.309 --> 01:12:22.473]  But at any rate, you know, it's really hard when you watch little children die and all.
[01:12:24.134 --> 01:12:27.277]  When I was overseas, you could watch your buddies die,
[01:12:28.112 --> 01:12:35.197]  And you expected to die yourself, and you accepted the idea.
[01:12:35.958 --> 01:12:37.819]  You just figured you were next.
[01:12:37.839 --> 01:12:40.421]  You didn't even bother about your buddies dying.
[01:12:40.901 --> 01:12:49.827]  So, all this stuff that people are afraid to die, it's something you just have to expect when you get ready to fight, as far as I'm concerned.
[01:12:49.847 --> 01:12:50.608]  Well, exactly.
[01:12:50.668 --> 01:12:56.592]  I mean, for soldiers, or for people who are old, who've lived their lives, it's not as sad, but to know that
[01:12:57.475 --> 01:13:12.185]  Our government has killed so many millions of children with bombs and vaccines and DU and to know what's happening in this country with the vaccines and all of it, it just hurts my heart and uh... it's just it's very painful.
[01:13:12.745 --> 01:13:13.486]  I know what you mean.
[01:13:14.166 --> 01:13:14.566]  Thank you.
[01:13:15.047 --> 01:13:16.247]  Alright, I appreciate the call.
[01:13:17.388 --> 01:13:20.750]  Let's talk to Cheryl in Ohio.
[01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:21.491]  You're on the air.
[01:13:21.531 --> 01:13:21.871]  Welcome.
[01:13:22.392 --> 01:13:23.092]  Thank you, sir.
[01:13:23.172 --> 01:13:24.093]  Mr. Jones, I want to
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:30.201]  I want to say to you that I do feel your compassion.
[01:13:30.221 --> 01:13:44.625]  I want to say that never say you're sorry for crying because what the Father showed you is right on and we are to pray and our hearts have become hardened.
[01:13:45.145 --> 01:13:54.587]  And in 2 Chronicles 7, God said that if His people who are called by His name shall humble themselves and pray,
[01:13:55.934 --> 01:14:01.137]  Yes, our hearts have become hardened and when we start praying for another person,
[01:14:06.835 --> 01:14:08.357]  I don't think so.
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:44.044]  It just melted my heart because he was indicative of just the you know the pain and the suffering of the innocent and the defenseless and it was just you know indescribable but exactly it was this incredible humbling.
[01:14:44.484 --> 01:14:45.825]  I mean that's the way to describe it.
[01:14:46.045 --> 01:14:50.446]  And yes and you know and how much we take for granted
[01:14:51.918 --> 01:14:54.419]  The healthy lives that we all live.
[01:14:55.339 --> 01:14:56.900]  You're expanding on it.
[01:14:56.980 --> 01:14:58.000]  I couldn't describe it earlier.
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:58.800]  It was humbling.
[01:14:59.060 --> 01:14:59.860]  It was painful.
[01:15:00.641 --> 01:15:05.982]  At the same time, I was so thankful that I'm healthy and my family is healthy.
[01:15:06.802 --> 01:15:08.983]  And that is so true.
[01:15:09.023 --> 01:15:10.884]  And if you would allow me and then I will hang up.
[01:15:11.384 --> 01:15:14.245]  May I lift a little prayer for that little child right now.
[01:15:14.785 --> 01:15:15.965]  If you would allow me to.
[01:15:16.425 --> 01:15:18.886]  Heavenly Father, I thank you for this day and I thank you
[01:15:19.548 --> 01:15:20.568]  We're good to go.
[01:15:40.413 --> 01:15:49.719]  And I thank you for the opportunity that we all have at this very moment in time, this very little piece of freedom that we have to be able to pray over the airwaves and in our homes at this very time.
[01:15:50.139 --> 01:15:53.942]  I thank you for all that you have given us and for the things that you have not given us yet.
[01:15:54.342 --> 01:16:00.266]  And I ask for all these things in your son's precious name, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus the Messiah.
[01:16:00.566 --> 01:16:02.607]  Thank you, Mr. Jones, and have a blessed day.
[01:16:02.747 --> 01:16:03.688]  Well, you too, Cheryl.
[01:16:03.848 --> 01:16:08.611]  And for those that again joined us, just so there's no confusion, I was just at the local pool
[01:16:09.504 --> 01:16:36.686]  I went to him some laps and I was just there and I saw this family with this little toddler who was so skinny and had no hair and his eyes were sunk in and he was in his sweet little voice and he was so sick and his parents sat him in the pool trying to make him happy and you could tell they were so sad and it just it hit me like a thunderbolt and then I think about the hard hearts of the New World Order how they can purposefully do bad things to children just
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:40.082]  Hell can't come soon enough for these people.
[01:16:41.523 --> 01:16:45.768]  And I know there is a God, and I know evil will be punished, but it needs to be punished now as well.
[01:16:45.828 --> 01:16:47.549]  These people need to be brought to justice.
[01:16:48.530 --> 01:16:52.695]  And I ask God just to protect the good people on this planet, but to punish the wicked.
[01:16:52.735 --> 01:16:54.677]  They need to be brought to justice!
[01:16:56.819 --> 01:16:58.240]  Let's talk to Kenneth in Texas.
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:58.941]  Kenneth, go ahead.
[01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:02.890]  Or Kim, the next call is Kim in Texas.
[01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:03.330]  Go ahead.
[01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:04.170]  Yes, this is Kim.
[01:17:04.871 --> 01:17:13.934]  You know, we've heard you talking about the vaccines and the false news reports and this just really angers me.
[01:17:13.954 --> 01:17:20.596]  For those that just joined us, false news reports coast to coast saying it's the law, you've got to vaccinate your children when it's not the law.
[01:17:21.216 --> 01:17:28.219]  You know, I have three children and I believe now that all three have experienced adverse reactions from
[01:17:29.561 --> 01:17:38.568]  Different immunizations and unfortunately Alex I didn't know about you until after the fact and didn't put two and two together until after the fact.
[01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:48.116]  But my third child last year in November had a flu shot and he was perfectly healthy.
[01:17:49.597 --> 01:17:58.864]  Immediately started developing rashes, asthma, you know now he's allergic to dairy and soy and you know everything.
[01:17:59.971 --> 01:18:06.793]  So, that's when I started investigating because I just knew something was wrong because my other two children were sick.
[01:18:07.893 --> 01:18:11.454]  My daughter has epilepsy and started having seizures when she was a child.
[01:18:12.255 --> 01:18:24.678]  And my other son, about a week after having his two-week rounds of immunizations, you know, when he was two weeks old, had pneumonia for the first time and has probably had pneumonia in excess of ten times.
[01:18:25.632 --> 01:18:26.492]  In his lifetime.
[01:18:26.953 --> 01:18:31.895]  And if they test the blood, they're going to find these engineered viruses over and over again.
[01:18:31.915 --> 01:18:36.797]  Tell you what, stay there, Kim, and then we'll get to Kenneth and Thomas and everybody else.
[01:18:37.418 --> 01:18:43.901]  But this is exactly what we're talking about, and we have the medical reports, we have the documents, and it just tears my heart out.
[01:18:44.381 --> 01:18:47.643]  Tears my guts out to see this evil committed.
[01:18:47.663 --> 01:18:48.683]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:54.625 --> 01:18:56.386]  Jack Brownring for Midas Resources.
[01:18:56.886 --> 01:19:00.308]  Last summer we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[01:19:00.829 --> 01:19:01.489]  Let's update.
[01:19:01.989 --> 01:19:05.451]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[01:19:06.672 --> 01:19:09.834]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[01:19:10.514 --> 01:19:13.836]  Two years ago the US dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[01:19:14.336 --> 01:19:17.498]  Today the US dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[01:19:17.898 --> 01:19:19.419]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[01:19:19.999 --> 01:19:21.960]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283.
[01:19:23.314 --> 01:19:28.175]  January of 04, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[01:19:29.175 --> 01:19:31.335]  Gold is moving, equities are treading water.
[01:19:31.736 --> 01:19:34.376]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[01:19:34.936 --> 01:19:36.296]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[01:19:36.736 --> 01:19:38.457]  Physical possession, private gold.
[01:19:38.877 --> 01:19:40.837]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.

[01:22:41.565 --> 01:22:42.646]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:22:42.666 --> 01:22:44.446]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:44.546 --> 01:22:46.027]  Let's continue with your calls.
[01:23:07.851 --> 01:23:15.116]  And then, I'm going to get into a bunch of the news coming up in the next segment, and there's a lot of it and it's important, so please stay with us.
[01:23:15.537 --> 01:23:18.619]  The calls are always very interesting and take us in a lot of important directions.
[01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:23.182]  Kim in Texas, you were talking about your children.
[01:23:23.863 --> 01:23:28.706]  I mean, I see the cases in the news every day, around the country, in the western world.
[01:23:29.967 --> 01:23:37.952]  No families, you know, who have a healthy, happy baby and 18 months old, they take it in and it gets some shots and has seizures in the car on the way home.
[01:23:37.992 --> 01:23:41.674]  I probably know five families in Austin that... I mean, it's just amazing.
[01:23:42.695 --> 01:23:44.896]  And folks, they're doing this on purpose.
[01:23:44.956 --> 01:23:47.438]  I'm not saying the doctors or the hospitals, they just do what they're told.
[01:23:47.458 --> 01:23:48.318]  No, it's good for you.
[01:23:48.939 --> 01:23:50.399]  This is out of control, folks.
[01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:51.580]  Yes, it is.
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:54.782]  And people just can't face the evil.
[01:23:55.603 --> 01:23:56.003]  Go ahead.
[01:23:56.283 --> 01:23:58.064]  Well, I just want people to do
[01:24:00.441 --> 01:24:07.586]  Do a little research and to, you know, stick with their gut feeling and just do what they think is right.
[01:24:07.646 --> 01:24:15.592]  And I don't want people to be pushed and bullied because I don't want them to have to experience... I mean, it's tough having three kids with health problems.
[01:24:15.873 --> 01:24:25.420]  I mean, it's tough enough as it is, but when you have other issues that were maybe caused by outside, you know, sources, then it's...
[01:24:26.897 --> 01:24:27.217]  I don't know.
[01:24:27.277 --> 01:24:28.398]  It's just heartbreaking.
[01:24:28.598 --> 01:24:29.418]  It's just tough.
[01:24:29.879 --> 01:24:34.961]  Well, Kim, I'm not a doctor, but I've interviewed many doctors and scientists on this.
[01:24:35.341 --> 01:24:36.602]  That's the stuff the vaccines do.
[01:24:36.642 --> 01:24:37.722]  They cause epilepsy.
[01:24:38.043 --> 01:24:39.063]  They cause brain damage.
[01:24:39.123 --> 01:24:44.746]  They're filled with different types of viruses that cause intestinal problems, lung problems.
[01:24:45.266 --> 01:24:51.769]  You can go onto the government's own website where they report adverse reactions, which most people don't even know about those websites.
[01:24:51.969 --> 01:24:52.210]  I know.
[01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:53.030]  It's all documented.
[01:24:53.170 --> 01:24:53.450]  Right.
[01:24:53.530 --> 01:24:54.851]  And you can pull it up and
[01:24:55.359 --> 01:25:00.981]  I mean, I cried for hours the first time I pulled that up because I knew I'd poison my children.
[01:25:01.001 --> 01:25:01.881]  That's how I feel.
[01:25:02.702 --> 01:25:04.242]  Well, that's the point.
[01:25:04.462 --> 01:25:11.345]  We can't have a culture that's killed 50 million children with abortion and not have it come back on the other children.
[01:25:11.365 --> 01:25:12.885]  This is how the globalists have set it up.
[01:25:12.945 --> 01:25:13.846]  They want to kill.
[01:25:13.906 --> 01:25:14.666]  They want to maim.
[01:25:14.706 --> 01:25:15.506]  They want to hurt.
[01:25:16.187 --> 01:25:17.047]  And it's so sad.
[01:25:17.067 --> 01:25:19.608]  And you know, Alex, I was one of those
[01:25:20.714 --> 01:25:36.845]  I have to admit, one of those, uh, jeffies you make fun of all the time, you know, set in my ways, everything was going good, you know, and I didn't want to see the truth, and somebody was brave enough to hand me your 9-11 Road to Tyranny, and it literally made me ill after I finished watching it.
[01:25:37.345 --> 01:25:39.727]  But it was the truth, and you just can't be in denial.
[01:25:39.767 --> 01:25:41.728]  You just, you just can't be.
[01:25:41.809 --> 01:25:44.731]  You can't be for your children, in my, in my instance.
[01:25:44.991 --> 01:25:48.093]  I've sat there in packed movie theaters with 400 people,
[01:25:49.092 --> 01:25:51.954]  Watching Road to Tyranny and they have horrified looks on their face.
[01:25:52.414 --> 01:25:53.154]  And that's good.
[01:25:54.255 --> 01:25:55.575]  It's the truth.
[01:25:55.715 --> 01:25:57.776]  I've lost a lot of friends down at the country club.
[01:25:57.796 --> 01:25:59.017]  They all think I'm crazy.
[01:25:59.737 --> 01:26:01.258]  But, you know, I'm not.
[01:26:01.718 --> 01:26:02.379]  They're crazy.
[01:26:02.439 --> 01:26:04.640]  They're just missing it.
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:06.281]  Well, it's like in Nazi Germany.
[01:26:06.361 --> 01:26:08.222]  You were crazy because you were against Hitler.
[01:26:08.782 --> 01:26:11.243]  But in truth, it doesn't matter what the general public says.
[01:26:11.323 --> 01:26:12.844]  No, Hitler was bad.
[01:26:12.884 --> 01:26:14.064]  Well, it's the same thing with the system.
[01:26:14.325 --> 01:26:14.885]  Thanks for the call.
[01:26:15.777 --> 01:26:23.399]  I mean, it's like living in Rome 2,000 years ago with the gladiatorial games and all the corruption and the dictatorship.
[01:26:23.459 --> 01:26:24.519]  Everybody thought it was great.
[01:26:25.199 --> 01:26:27.360]  And the minority thought it was bad, and they were crazy.
[01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:28.340]  But no, they weren't crazy.
[01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:32.861]  Let's talk to Thomas in Germany, in Deutschland.
[01:26:32.921 --> 01:26:33.901]  Thomas, you're on the air.
[01:26:34.601 --> 01:26:34.782]  Yes.
[01:26:35.002 --> 01:26:35.582]  Hello, Alex.
[01:26:35.862 --> 01:26:36.362]  Hello, sir.
[01:26:36.942 --> 01:26:38.222]  This is Thomas, Germany.
[01:26:38.682 --> 01:26:39.023]  Welcome.
[01:26:39.363 --> 01:26:44.304]  And I'm... You know, I meant to go to you earlier, but I forgot we had a caller from Germany, so I apologize.
[01:26:44.804 --> 01:26:45.244]  No problem.
[01:26:45.805 --> 01:26:48.986]  But I'm a little bit sorry for my English, so I'll try my best.
[01:26:50.387 --> 01:26:51.147]  Well, it sounds good.
[01:26:51.167 --> 01:26:51.567]  Go ahead.
[01:26:52.228 --> 01:26:54.209]  We'll see.
[01:26:54.389 --> 01:27:00.211]  I can ask thousands of questions, but I'll try to point out five or something.
[01:27:01.672 --> 01:27:09.395]  The first is, I always knew that there was something wrong, and as I go into this, what you
[01:27:10.296 --> 01:27:11.877]  Showing you videos and everything.
[01:27:12.337 --> 01:27:15.819]  I mean, I can't, you, the normal people can't believe that.
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:27.526]  And, uh, I mean, my question is, at the top of the top, the top people, which are on the highest pyramid, what are these?
[01:27:29.487 --> 01:27:30.467]  Is it a bloodline?
[01:27:30.927 --> 01:27:31.268]  Yes.
[01:27:32.708 --> 01:27:34.289]  And where did that come from?
[01:27:34.349 --> 01:27:39.012]  Is this, for the most part, of the English, the old fashion?
[01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:40.460]  Yes, sir.
[01:27:40.621 --> 01:27:47.486]  It's royal families that trace their lineage, even back to Rome and Persia.
[01:27:48.146 --> 01:28:02.097]  The London Guardian just reported how Kerry is related to the royalty of Persia, to Germany, to England, to Russia, to Albania, just everything.
[01:28:02.117 --> 01:28:07.021]  It's pure bloodline, pure royalty, pure evil, pure despotism.
[01:28:07.081 --> 01:28:08.682]  And he, of course, is related to Bush.
[01:28:11.018 --> 01:28:15.642]  I mean, this is a high-level breeding program, and they believe they're God.
[01:28:15.682 --> 01:28:16.803]  I tell you what, stay there Thomas.
[01:28:16.823 --> 01:28:18.785]  We'll come back after break, give you a few more minutes.
[01:28:18.825 --> 01:28:20.666]  I appreciate you holding on your own dime.
[01:28:21.186 --> 01:28:22.067]  We'll come right back to you.
[01:28:22.087 --> 01:28:22.708]  Will you stay with us?
[01:28:23.168 --> 01:28:24.129]  Yeah, I think.
[01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:25.150]  Okay, hold right there.
[01:28:25.190 --> 01:28:25.690]  Don't hang up.
[01:28:26.250 --> 01:28:37.519]  We'll come back for a few minutes with Thomas, then I'll get into some news, and we'll go to all the other callers that are patiently holding at 1-800-259-9231, and get into all this news.
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:39.060]  Please stay with us.
[01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:39.681]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.422 --> 01:28:46.427]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.348 --> 01:28:50.033]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.411 --> 01:28:57.312]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:28:57.552 --> 01:29:02.973]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:29:03.253 --> 01:29:13.616]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:29:13.796 --> 01:29:18.117]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:29:18.317 --> 01:29:19.118]  We're good to go.
[01:29:33.328 --> 01:29:36.430]  We all have busy lives and sometimes that causes us to miss out on the things that are most important to us.
[01:29:36.450 --> 01:29:40.052]  Well, when it comes to Genesis programs, you'll never have to miss out again.

[01:30:20.336 --> 01:30:24.300]  All you need to know is the name of the program you would like a copy of and the month that it aired.
[01:30:24.813 --> 01:30:28.136]  Don't be left out of current news and information that affects our lives every day.

[01:30:53.456 --> 01:30:55.797]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:30:56.038 --> 01:30:59.880]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:01.020]  Read the labels.
[01:31:01.441 --> 01:31:05.583]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:31:05.783 --> 01:31:09.986]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:31:10.366 --> 01:31:15.229]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:31:15.609 --> 01:31:19.190]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.

[01:32:02.606 --> 01:32:05.568]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:08.826 --> 01:32:10.346]  We're all going to die someday.
[01:32:12.447 --> 01:32:16.527]  We might as well stand up against evil and tyranny.
[01:32:18.408 --> 01:32:20.988]  Going back to Thomas in Germany.
[01:32:21.688 --> 01:32:24.649]  Oh, and by the way, did Debbie call in, Stephanie?
[01:32:25.929 --> 01:32:27.089]  Why don't you get her on the line too?
[01:32:27.109 --> 01:32:28.530]  I want to spend a few minutes with her if we can.
[01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:30.230]  I think she was scheduled right now.
[01:32:31.570 --> 01:32:34.831]  Thomas in Germany was bringing up the point
[01:32:35.558 --> 01:32:36.919]  About who are these people?
[01:32:36.979 --> 01:32:38.140]  Who are the New World Order?
[01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:39.541]  Is it a royal bloodline?
[01:32:39.661 --> 01:32:40.782]  And yes it is.
[01:32:41.282 --> 01:32:42.303]  They think they're God.
[01:32:43.704 --> 01:32:58.034]  Many years ago on C-SPAN, I watched a ceremony at the Tower, where leaders from all over the world, it was some big globalist confab, I think it was a G7 meeting, now it's a G8, going from memory, probably 10 years ago,
[01:32:59.241 --> 01:33:11.269]  And I sat there and watched it, and they went into how all the royal families of the world say that the official royal family is the British royal family, and that's who they all have fealty to, and they're in this big society.
[01:33:11.289 --> 01:33:12.590]  But that was interesting to watch that.
[01:33:15.192 --> 01:33:22.957]  It just doesn't happen by accident that Bush and Kerry are cousins, members of the same 15-member-a-year secret society,
[01:33:24.597 --> 01:33:33.749]  That they're related to every major house, every royal house in the Western and even Central Asian world.
[01:33:35.311 --> 01:33:36.573]  They're all intermarried.
[01:33:37.774 --> 01:33:38.535]  And now the
[01:33:41.790 --> 01:33:50.373]  Merck's peerage, that's the big elite chronicling body that the Queen of England officially uses, they've come out and said no one in U.S.
[01:33:50.413 --> 01:33:53.214]  history has been this royal as Kerry.
[01:33:53.234 --> 01:33:55.755]  He is related to every one of these houses.
[01:33:56.515 --> 01:33:59.316]  That's why he's related to Bush on all four sides of his family.
[01:34:00.217 --> 01:34:07.059]  That is, on his paternal or his maternal side, male and female side, on both sides of their families.
[01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:11.481]  So all four sides on each side are related to each other.
[01:34:12.699 --> 01:34:15.442]  They're 3rd cousins, 9th cousins, 16th cousins.
[01:34:15.802 --> 01:34:23.749]  Every angle you look at them, as they learn more angles, they're cousins in every possible way.
[01:34:25.771 --> 01:34:32.917]  It's like if you've got a Boston Terrier that's a hybrid Boston Terrier, well he's cousins to every Boston Terrier out there.
[01:34:33.217 --> 01:34:34.799]  These guys are a breed of evil.
[01:34:35.399 --> 01:34:37.001]  And they're into the occult.
[01:34:39.371 --> 01:34:40.512]  That's what the Nazis were.
[01:34:40.532 --> 01:34:42.394]  That was some of their creations.
[01:34:42.994 --> 01:34:44.296]  That's what the Communists are.
[01:34:44.496 --> 01:34:44.956]  All of this.
[01:34:45.136 --> 01:34:45.637]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:34:47.558 --> 01:34:54.725]  It's really hard to get, and I want to make a notice when you... It's all... The most things are about democracy.
[01:34:55.225 --> 01:35:00.770]  So when you really translate democracy from the base, it's popular government.
[01:35:01.791 --> 01:35:05.674]  It says that control and power has to be by the people.
[01:35:07.082 --> 01:35:09.483]  So, where do we have democracy?
[01:35:09.623 --> 01:35:15.046]  To vote every four years or every six years here in Germany?
[01:35:15.346 --> 01:35:15.967]  We have nothing!
[01:35:17.328 --> 01:35:19.849]  Well, what they do is, it's just like a horse race.
[01:35:19.909 --> 01:35:25.352]  They say, well, you can bet on the horse race, but we own all the horses.
[01:35:26.192 --> 01:35:27.953]  And so, either way, they win.
[01:35:28.333 --> 01:35:32.916]  They have pre-selected it, and that's why we focus too much on the big federal elections.
[01:35:33.276 --> 01:35:36.538]  The real power, where we can still have an effect, is county, city, state level.
[01:35:37.467 --> 01:35:40.308]  And we get diverted off into these presidential elections.
[01:35:42.248 --> 01:35:51.110]  Well, okay, second point is, I think people don't believe because it's so hard without a big evidence.
[01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:59.852]  So, and there was my tip, it's now a few weeks, it's a few weeks away.
[01:36:00.892 --> 01:36:03.813]  You know the short video in plain sight?
[01:36:05.143 --> 01:36:05.443]  Yes.
[01:36:06.284 --> 01:36:07.805]  This new one, you saw it?
[01:36:08.365 --> 01:36:09.866]  No, I've watched a little bit of it.
[01:36:09.926 --> 01:36:11.847]  I didn't have time to watch the whole thing.
[01:36:12.027 --> 01:36:31.759]  Perhaps when you have time, because I think... I think at 9-11, 9-11 is a real key because these people relieved themselves at that day.
[01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:34.021]  And in this
[01:36:34.774 --> 01:36:35.495]  Video.
[01:36:35.615 --> 01:36:40.479]  There are real video evidences that there's something under the plane.
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:45.403]  And there's a flash on the first plane and on the second plane.
[01:36:46.263 --> 01:36:54.150]  And I think when people... My tip is, when you use this, when people see this, these are real evidences.
[01:36:54.630 --> 01:36:54.890]  Yeah.
[01:36:55.090 --> 01:36:55.711]  By video.
[01:36:55.971 --> 01:36:57.412]  Sir, I appreciate your call.
[01:36:57.492 --> 01:36:59.454]  Where are you listening to this from in Germany?
[01:37:00.815 --> 01:37:02.076]  This is Nordrhein-Westfalen.
[01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:04.521]  It's in the north of Germany.
[01:37:05.582 --> 01:37:07.404]  Well, good to have you on with us and take care.
[01:37:08.164 --> 01:37:08.344]  Yeah.
[01:37:08.545 --> 01:37:09.946]  Can I ask one question?
[01:37:09.986 --> 01:37:10.206]  Sure.
[01:37:10.226 --> 01:37:19.254]  Have you any preparations in translating your videos in other languages?
[01:37:20.034 --> 01:37:26.500]  You know, I'm so busy that I don't even hardly have time to stop and eat a meal.
[01:37:29.318 --> 01:37:30.199]  I would like to do that.
[01:37:30.219 --> 01:37:32.180]  I would like to put my films out in other languages.
[01:37:32.621 --> 01:37:37.845]  Yeah, because it's so hard here in Germany to wake up people because most people don't speak English.
[01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:39.046]  It's true.
[01:37:39.667 --> 01:37:44.051]  Well, we get a lot of visitors to the websites from Germany and we get quite a few calls now from Germany.
[01:37:44.111 --> 01:37:47.093]  It seems like there is somewhat of an awakening taking place there.
[01:37:47.674 --> 01:37:47.834]  Yes.
[01:37:48.455 --> 01:37:52.218]  So, I'd like to point out, I can do this.
[01:37:52.961 --> 01:37:53.582]  I can do this.
[01:37:53.942 --> 01:37:55.203]  Well, feel free to do it.
[01:37:56.323 --> 01:37:57.104]  With subtitles.
[01:37:57.604 --> 01:37:58.005]  Well, good.
[01:37:58.045 --> 01:37:58.305]  Do it.
[01:37:59.866 --> 01:38:05.450]  Perhaps if we take an email contact or something, I can do it.
[01:38:05.470 --> 01:38:05.790]  Okay.
[01:38:06.110 --> 01:38:07.731]  Tips at InfoWars.com.
[01:38:07.771 --> 01:38:08.492]  Take care, Thomas.
[01:38:09.092 --> 01:38:11.634]  Good to hear from you and I appreciate your interest in getting involved.
[01:38:13.455 --> 01:38:15.397]  Let's get Debbie Morrow up here for a few minutes.
[01:38:15.417 --> 01:38:18.919]  Then we'll cover news and we'll go back to all these other callers that are patiently holding.
[01:38:18.939 --> 01:38:19.280]  Debbie?
[01:38:20.743 --> 01:38:21.303]  Hi there, Alex.
[01:38:21.624 --> 01:38:22.624]  Good to have you on with us.
[01:38:22.905 --> 01:38:23.545]  Thank you.
[01:38:23.565 --> 01:38:24.406]  Good to be here.
[01:38:25.006 --> 01:38:40.137]  Wars and rumors of wars and crises and hurricanes and all the rest of it, but bottom line, my reason for four years ago buying my first big Berkey water filter, four and a half years ago, is because it's one of the most high quality systems known.
[01:38:40.157 --> 01:38:42.238]  It takes about a minute and a half to put together.
[01:38:42.298 --> 01:38:43.479]  It's gravity fed.
[01:38:43.539 --> 01:38:44.440]  No moving parts.
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:47.502]  And it purifies my water for myself and my family.
[01:38:48.212 --> 01:38:54.319]  And you've got some great specials on this system made right here in America, which is a rarity by the way.
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:56.541]  Tell folks about it and the different specials.
[01:38:56.962 --> 01:39:08.595]  Okay, well first I want to let people know, anybody on the East Coast, because it is hurricane season and could hit anywhere at any time in the next couple of months,
[01:39:09.286 --> 01:39:18.329]  We are offering to ship to the East Coast or any of those areas that might have problems.
[01:39:19.569 --> 01:39:28.372]  We'll send it express overnight and only charge the normal $18 shipping instead of charging like $60 for shipping.
[01:39:29.318 --> 01:39:32.179]  So that's one thing that I do want everybody to be aware of.
[01:39:32.319 --> 01:39:48.582]  So that's a $40 discount on the shipping and then you're already discounting the black light system for $199 plus you still get the free gift of the Sheltering in Place video or the Prudent Places DVD or one of the sport Burkeys.
[01:39:48.762 --> 01:39:49.742]  Right, exactly.
[01:39:49.782 --> 01:39:51.942]  So that's like $80 something dollars off.
[01:39:52.302 --> 01:39:53.282]  That's correct.
[01:39:53.382 --> 01:39:56.623]  And then if they want to get the Burkey light with the light
[01:39:57.318 --> 01:40:01.582]  Then it's $2.59 and they get two free gifts.
[01:40:01.722 --> 01:40:07.006]  Are you doing that overnight shipping for anybody in the country?
[01:40:07.146 --> 01:40:16.975]  Actually, we're kind of focusing just on the East Coast because that is where, you know, we have really fast shipping anyway.
[01:40:16.995 --> 01:40:22.920]  I mean, for your listeners in the Colorado area and everything, they're getting it one or two days anyway because we ship
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:30.683]  You know, if I take an order today, we normally ship it tomorrow and then they get it the next day or, you know, within just a couple of days anyway.
[01:40:31.303 --> 01:40:35.725]  But because of the crisis, we want to go ahead and offer that on the East Coast.
[01:40:35.785 --> 01:40:39.787]  Yeah, there's still people in Florida with no power and having to boil their water.
[01:40:40.447 --> 01:40:46.950]  Yeah, and I get customers lately every day who are, you know, there's still no electricity, no power.
[01:40:46.970 --> 01:40:52.752]  I had one customer who had a Berkey and lived further north
[01:40:53.351 --> 01:40:59.156]  And he was going to drive down to the disaster areas and help his family that live down there.
[01:40:59.176 --> 01:41:03.840]  Okay, the toll-free number to call Debbie, and if the phone's busy, leave your name and number.
[01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:08.584]  She'll call you right back.
[01:41:08.604 --> 01:41:09.164]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:41:10.045 --> 01:41:12.968]  Bottom line, folks, I don't even get these for crises.
[01:41:12.988 --> 01:41:14.048]  If that happens, you got it.
[01:41:14.409 --> 01:41:15.730]  You certainly need it on the East Coast.
[01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:19.622]  But just to stop drinking the poison, the water is full of garbage.
[01:41:19.642 --> 01:41:20.702]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:41:20.722 --> 01:41:27.165]  And tell them Alex Jones sends you to take advantage of those specials.
[01:41:27.565 --> 01:41:30.427]  Or Berkeywater.com in the comments section.
[01:41:30.467 --> 01:41:33.028]  Tell them what free gifts you want and tell them it's an Alex Jones special.
[01:41:34.367 --> 01:41:34.507]  888-803-4438.
[01:41:34.827 --> 01:41:38.372]  Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[01:41:38.612 --> 01:41:39.473]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:41:39.533 --> 01:41:42.757]  I did want to tell you what happened to me the other day real quick.
[01:41:43.137 --> 01:41:45.099]  I think your listeners would be really interested.
[01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:49.244]  I went to the tanning spot because I have like a few free tans, you know?
[01:41:49.705 --> 01:41:50.966]  They wanted to fingerprint me!
[01:41:53.562 --> 01:41:54.523]  I wanted to finger print you.
[01:42:09.798 --> 01:42:11.298]  And I said, absolutely not!
[01:42:12.099 --> 01:42:19.561]  And they said, well, if you give us your fingerprint, then you won't have to show us your driver's license every time we come and we'll know it's you.
[01:42:19.641 --> 01:42:21.802]  And I said, you must be out of your mind!
[01:42:22.022 --> 01:42:24.042]  Was this an inkless scanner?
[01:42:25.003 --> 01:42:25.663]  What does that mean?
[01:42:26.343 --> 01:42:28.104]  It was electronic, not ink-based.
[01:42:28.424 --> 01:42:29.644]  No, it was electronic.
[01:42:29.724 --> 01:42:31.585]  It was like this little light thing.
[01:42:31.805 --> 01:42:33.205]  Yeah, a little red light.
[01:42:33.225 --> 01:42:35.326]  And they wanted me to put my finger on it four times.
[01:42:36.164 --> 01:42:38.206]  And I said, absolutely not.
[01:42:38.506 --> 01:42:46.073]  And the poor kid behind the register, he's kind of like... Now, Debbie, I know you live up by Dallas and Fort Worth.
[01:42:46.113 --> 01:42:47.234]  Do you live in Arlington?
[01:42:47.714 --> 01:42:48.255]  Actually, no.
[01:42:48.695 --> 01:42:53.480]  I live in Grapevine, but this was in Heurst, right around the H-E-B area.
[01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:58.104]  Oh, it was in the same shopping center as an H-E-B?
[01:42:58.324 --> 01:42:58.784]  No, no, no.
[01:42:58.985 --> 01:43:00.006]  H-E-B is Heurst.
[01:43:03.628 --> 01:43:13.421]  Well, let me just tell you, the only place I could find it posted was in our Yahoo group from like two years ago, two and a half years ago, when we first started the Yahoo group.
[01:43:13.441 --> 01:43:14.762]  It's in the earliest postings.
[01:43:15.203 --> 01:43:19.809]  We have a scan, a screenshot of the Dallas Morning News and it said,
[01:43:20.740 --> 01:43:32.344]  There's also another article out of Denver, in the county where they did this, and the police said, it's not a law, but we're asking all stores to put inkless thumb scanners in, in all their stores.
[01:43:32.364 --> 01:43:41.107]  And of course, most refused, but they said, well, we won't prosecute check thieves then for you, you know, refusing to do what they're supposed to, if you don't do this, all color of law.
[01:43:41.607 --> 01:43:44.828]  So it was areas of Denver, and it was Arlington that first said this,
[01:43:45.349 --> 01:43:52.111]  Part of a federal program, and I know that hundreds of stores in Arlington, because I've gotten a lot of emails and calls about it, it was in the newspaper, as I said, have done this.
[01:43:53.110 --> 01:43:57.173]  And even when you go in and try to pay with cash, they go, ooh, thumb scan will give you a discount.
[01:43:57.213 --> 01:44:00.476]  I mean, this is really going in all over the country.
[01:44:00.836 --> 01:44:08.122]  And so you bought your group of tans, and these fools have this thumb scanner.
[01:44:08.222 --> 01:44:10.003]  And folks, this is going to be for everywhere.
[01:44:10.043 --> 01:44:15.027]  When we have the new national sales tax, everything's going to go to biometrics.
[01:44:15.947 --> 01:44:18.450]  Because, well, we can't have the poor people pay a sales tax.
[01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:27.417]  It's going to be fair, which I actually agree with, but the point is it'll be administered, though, by the feds in every business through a thumb scanner, and I'm not for that.
[01:44:28.198 --> 01:44:32.222]  And you warn people about this, they laugh at you, but Debbie, you saw it face-to-face.
[01:44:32.762 --> 01:44:35.104]  I mean... I couldn't believe it.
[01:44:35.465 --> 01:44:39.508]  Well, look, I tried to go to, you know, take the family to SeaWorld.
[01:44:39.548 --> 01:44:40.809]  Hadn't been since I was a child.
[01:44:40.869 --> 01:44:46.014]  And I went, and they said, oh, it's double the price if you don't hand scan.
[01:44:47.255 --> 01:44:48.456]  And I refused, of course.
[01:44:48.476 --> 01:44:50.097]  And they said, ooh, a lot of people are refusing.
[01:44:50.137 --> 01:44:51.779]  Go on through, you can still get the discount.
[01:44:52.387 --> 01:44:53.228]  I'll never go back.
[01:44:53.248 --> 01:44:54.369]  It was just the experience.
[01:44:55.349 --> 01:44:57.811]  But now they're saying all the other parks.
[01:44:57.871 --> 01:44:59.252]  Six Flags, Disney World.
[01:44:59.652 --> 01:45:01.233]  They're all putting it in, folks.
[01:45:02.454 --> 01:45:02.674]  Yep.
[01:45:02.915 --> 01:45:04.876]  Then I'll know everything we're doing is bad enough.
[01:45:04.896 --> 01:45:08.479]  You know they want us to put a card at the grocery store.
[01:45:08.519 --> 01:45:09.139]  And did you know?
[01:45:09.579 --> 01:45:13.022]  You don't have to do that to get the discounts at the grocery store.
[01:45:13.382 --> 01:45:18.526]  You can ask the checker to use their store card and just tell them that you left yours at home.
[01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:24.803]  Yeah, but see Debbie, that just gets around the system.
[01:45:24.843 --> 01:45:26.764]  It's the system itself that's bad.
[01:45:27.104 --> 01:45:27.424]  I know.
[01:45:28.144 --> 01:45:30.325]  So, I mean, how did this conversation end with him?
[01:45:30.866 --> 01:45:31.726]  Get a Berkey!
[01:45:31.926 --> 01:45:32.406]  Oh, mine?
[01:45:32.867 --> 01:45:37.249]  Well, he just thought, you know, when I told him, I said, well, you're out of your mind.
[01:45:37.269 --> 01:45:39.450]  There's absolutely no way you're getting my fingerprint.
[01:45:39.870 --> 01:45:43.992]  And he just looked at me and he said, well, you're going to have to show your driver's license every time you come in.
[01:45:44.653 --> 01:45:46.093]  And I said, well, that's perfectly fine.
[01:45:46.113 --> 01:45:47.354]  I don't mind doing that.
[01:45:48.308 --> 01:45:53.790]  You know, and he went, well, okay, you know, I mean, it was just, he just couldn't believe, you know, and he was a young guy.
[01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:54.930]  Hey, do me a favor.
[01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:58.251]  You don't have to tell us exactly where it's at, because there'll be a bunch of them, probably.
[01:45:58.271 --> 01:46:00.652]  It's probably a big chain, or something, inside tech.
[01:46:00.692 --> 01:46:01.812]  What's the name of the tan place?
[01:46:02.132 --> 01:46:03.173]  Palm Beach Tans.
[01:46:04.333 --> 01:46:04.733]  Okay.
[01:46:04.873 --> 01:46:07.834]  Palm Beach Tans.
[01:46:07.974 --> 01:46:09.315]  Hey, I'll tell you what, Stephanie.
[01:46:10.075 --> 01:46:11.956]  I want you to call information, please.
[01:46:12.796 --> 01:46:13.676]  What town is this in?
[01:46:13.736 --> 01:46:16.157]  This was the one on Harwood.
[01:46:17.105 --> 01:46:17.665]  Say that again?
[01:46:18.006 --> 01:46:25.109]  On Harwood, and I'm not sure if it's Bedford, Ulis, or Hurst.
[01:46:25.249 --> 01:46:30.072]  Okay, so it's Harwood in Bredford or Lewis.
[01:46:30.972 --> 01:46:32.813]  It's in the Dallas Metroplex area.
[01:46:32.833 --> 01:46:33.333]  Right.
[01:46:33.433 --> 01:46:35.394]  And it's Palm Beach, Tan, Stephanie.
[01:46:35.474 --> 01:46:36.755]  Will you call information?
[01:46:37.115 --> 01:46:44.059]  Palm Beach, Tan, Harwood, Bredford, Ulis, or Hurst.
[01:46:44.319 --> 01:46:46.020]  Bredford, Ulis, or Hurst.
[01:46:47.203 --> 01:46:50.626]  Hearst is the right name, the end of freedom, rolling that coffin away.
[01:46:50.646 --> 01:46:58.893]  I want to give them a call in the next hour and just say, hey Alex Jones, you're live on the air, we're just curious about your thumb scanner, how interesting.
[01:46:59.113 --> 01:47:01.455]  It's a finger scanner.
[01:47:01.675 --> 01:47:02.396]  Was it indexed?
[01:47:02.776 --> 01:47:04.618]  I don't know because I refused to do it.
[01:47:05.218 --> 01:47:07.100]  I didn't give them my finger.
[01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:12.064]  It was probably a North American Morpho system or biometric access system.
[01:47:12.585 --> 01:47:13.966]  They seem to be dominating Texas.
[01:47:14.226 --> 01:47:15.267]  It was probably a thumb scanner.
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:16.740]  I have no idea.
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:19.621]  Yeah, but we'll call them, okay?
[01:47:19.881 --> 01:47:26.403]  Okay, and everybody call me to order your Berkey's because, you know, there's so many things going on right now.
[01:47:26.643 --> 01:47:28.904]  It is so important to have good water.
[01:47:28.924 --> 01:47:28.964]  888-803-4438.
[01:47:29.044 --> 01:47:30.685]  Thanks, Debbie.
[01:47:30.725 --> 01:47:32.245]  Thanks, bye.
[01:47:32.485 --> 01:47:32.785]  You bet.
[01:47:32.865 --> 01:47:35.306]  Okay, let me just run, scan through some news.
[01:47:35.326 --> 01:47:37.627]  I know folks are holding, but I just need to go over this.
[01:47:38.988 --> 01:47:40.729]  This is all very, very important.
[01:47:41.009 --> 01:47:42.549]  Here's an article out of AFP.
[01:47:42.669 --> 01:47:47.071]  Government plans to turn on your TV, radio, and cell phone in an emergency.
[01:47:47.091 --> 01:47:51.812]  And I interviewed the former top lawyer for the FCC over this program.
[01:47:51.832 --> 01:47:53.513]  He's now a professor up in Chicago.
[01:47:53.553 --> 01:47:54.713]  He's against it, by the way.
[01:47:54.753 --> 01:47:55.934]  But they tried this in 1989.
[01:47:57.074 --> 01:48:01.155]  Your cell phone now, all your radio, your TV, that can all be taken over.
[01:48:01.195 --> 01:48:06.097]  But now they say here that the emergency alert system
[01:48:06.993 --> 01:48:16.942]  We'll control your internet, your cell phones, your home phone will call with a special ring, and by law you'll have to answer it to get computer instructions.
[01:48:17.943 --> 01:48:25.290]  And it's going to be everything, and they're going to have government announcements on all the radio and TV channels, taking over hours of time, whenever they feel like it.
[01:48:25.350 --> 01:48:28.353]  Not just for emergencies, but for public service announcements.
[01:48:28.713 --> 01:48:32.016]  I told engineers and station owners this five years ago, they laugh at me.
[01:48:33.081 --> 01:48:40.668]  Now they call up going, my gosh, I was at a broadcaster's meeting, you know, for our state, and for Texas, California, I've heard about it in New Mexico.
[01:48:40.968 --> 01:48:48.875]  We're told, yeah, the government's going to be taking their own time now, and the system's all wired in to take over whenever they want, and now it's going to be the Internet!
[01:48:48.895 --> 01:48:50.116]  They're going to take the Internet over!
[01:48:50.576 --> 01:48:53.099]  When you go to InfoWars.com, it'll be FEMA.
[01:48:53.499 --> 01:48:54.740]  You have been redirected to FEMA.
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:59.564]  It's like when you call up, a truck calls up in Florida, it's redirected to FEMA, you know, in those areas.
[01:49:02.666 --> 01:49:04.587]  It's all part of the freedom, folks.
[01:49:04.627 --> 01:49:11.352]  So you know, just what to do during this big emergency that's just sure to come any minute.
[01:49:11.912 --> 01:49:14.914]  If we don't give up all of our freedoms, we just won't be safe.
[01:49:16.895 --> 01:49:22.359]  Also, in Najaf, we have troops opening up coffins to search for guns.
[01:49:22.419 --> 01:49:25.961]  They've blown up part of the mosque to stir the Muslims up.
[01:49:27.012 --> 01:49:36.615]  And, uh, the Shiite sub, and then the Christian Science Monitor and two other major media, uh, got their people in and there's no weapons, no nothing, just several thousand people ready to die.
[01:49:36.635 --> 01:49:41.557]  And Brett Hume, great journalist, got up on TV and said, let's just kill him!
[01:49:42.637 --> 01:49:43.978]  Just get in there and kill that guy!
[01:49:44.498 --> 01:49:49.039]  Oh yeah, because he was our ally and it's against us putting the Ba'ath Party into control of Saddam's people.
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:50.500]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:49:53.197 --> 01:49:57.541]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:57.721 --> 01:50:02.165]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.285 --> 01:50:06.688]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:06.729 --> 01:50:08.070]  The New World Order.
[01:50:08.770 --> 01:50:09.611]  Panama.
[01:50:09.852 --> 01:50:14.076]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.136 --> 01:50:21.084]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.204 --> 01:50:23.227]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:23.587 --> 01:50:34.035]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.195 --> 01:50:39.599]  If you want to understand what the new old order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:50:52.890 --> 01:50:54.511]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:54.651 --> 01:50:58.794]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:50:58.894 --> 01:51:01.776]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:51:01.856 --> 01:51:08.581]  The powerful Black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:51:08.761 --> 01:51:11.763]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:51:11.963 --> 01:51:14.365]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:51:14.485 --> 01:51:19.889]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalo
[01:51:19.889 --> 01:51:20.389]  We're good to go!

[01:53:11.259 --> 01:53:14.540]  And then we'll get back into all this other news.
[01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:17.661]  But continuing here, I want to get into Donald Rumsfeld.
[01:53:18.786 --> 01:53:20.767]  And some of the wicked things that he's up to.

[01:53:54.610 --> 01:53:58.192]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.

[01:54:14.179 --> 01:54:17.280]  Okay, I want to get into CNN hijacker visa found in flight 93 wreckage.
[01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:18.560]  I mean, how ridiculous can it get?
[01:54:18.620 --> 01:54:21.321]  But first off here, this is out of the BBC.
[01:54:21.721 --> 01:54:27.782]  Rumsfeld to escape Abu Ghraib blame from the commission he appointed.
[01:54:28.842 --> 01:54:30.383]  Now, we have the BBC article under it.
[01:54:30.423 --> 01:54:31.143]  That's our headline.
[01:54:31.503 --> 01:54:32.603]  He appointed this commission.
[01:54:32.643 --> 01:54:34.304]  It's like Bush appointed the 9-11 commission.
[01:54:34.484 --> 01:54:36.464]  It's like Bill Clinton appointed the Waco commission.
[01:54:36.884 --> 01:54:37.865]  I mean, it's the same thing.
[01:54:38.485 --> 01:54:39.105]  It's independent.
[01:54:39.125 --> 01:54:39.825]  Yes, it's appointed.
[01:54:39.845 --> 01:54:43.586]  It's like Herman Goering being appointed by Hitler for the Nuremberg trials.
[01:54:44.569 --> 01:54:49.152]  Rumsfeld to escape Abu Ghraib blame from the commission he appointed.
[01:54:49.212 --> 01:54:50.333]  A commission appointed by U.S.
[01:54:50.833 --> 01:54:56.477]  Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is due to publish its report on the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal in Iraq.
[01:54:56.757 --> 01:54:59.999]  The panel was appointed by Mr. Rumsfeld at the height of the scandal in May.
[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:02.781]  Now the British are saying that he was appointed.
[01:55:02.901 --> 01:55:03.882]  Our news doesn't mention that.
[01:55:04.022 --> 01:55:05.223]  It's an independent commission.
[01:55:06.144 --> 01:55:12.306]  Link's suggestions of Rumsfeld will be faulted for not exercising sufficient oversight of interrogation policies.
[01:55:12.346 --> 01:55:19.148]  They're also suggesting your Pentagon officials will be criticized for failing to recognize deteriorating circumstances to Abu Ghraib in prison.
[01:55:19.748 --> 01:55:23.849]  But, see, it'll be a big whitewash, but a little slap on the wrist so we take it serious.
[01:55:25.390 --> 01:55:26.410]  Very, very disgusting.
[01:55:26.990 --> 01:55:28.511]  Uh, remember back in 19...
[01:55:32.453 --> 01:55:48.742]  93 the FBI cook the bomb and train the driver for the World Trade Center bombing and then we have Oklahoma City was government off well 2001 we have these planes fly into buildings and a passport jumps out of one of their pockets through the burning fireball inside the plane through the metal and aluminum and plastic
[01:55:49.142 --> 01:56:08.835]  And through the millions of papers inside the building, flies through the girders, out the building, out clear of all the rubble falling and all the dust and debris and fires, and flies down as picked up by a police officer the next day, and then it turned out that the supposed hijacker was still alive, and they said, okay, that was a mistake, that wasn't a real passport, it's a mistake.
[01:56:09.795 --> 01:56:10.936]  And then there's no discussion of it.
[01:56:11.356 --> 01:56:12.397]  Obviously planted there.
[01:56:12.897 --> 01:56:15.519]  Well, the same people now have unveiled
[01:56:16.557 --> 01:56:20.258]  A half-burned photo, supposedly from Flight 93.
[01:56:20.718 --> 01:56:23.879]  CNN hijacker visa found in Flight 93 wreckage.
[01:56:24.379 --> 01:56:34.582]  By Paul Joseph Watson for PrisonPlanet.com, CNN is reporting that 9-11 hijacker Zaid Jarr's visa was found in the remains of Flight 93, which went down in Jakesville, Pennsylvania.
[01:56:35.023 --> 01:56:44.726]  Even if we are to entertain the notion that this piece of paper is supposedly in the pocket of a suicide pilot who survived a crash which left aircraft parts screwn eight miles
[01:56:46.676 --> 01:56:49.397]  Through the two photographs shown above, you can represent the same person.
[01:56:49.797 --> 01:57:00.142]  Zaid Jahar's family provided evidence days after 9-11 that Jahar wasn't even on board flight 93, and that if he was, it was only as a passenger who was just as much a victim as the rest of the people on the plane.
[01:57:00.754 --> 01:57:11.884]  The FBI has been evasive on whether or not the hijacker passports were found in the wreckage of the World Trade Center, but the 9-11 Commission has now presented photographs which they say show the charred paper visa.
[01:57:12.124 --> 01:57:17.749]  A few days after the attack, several newspapers reported that a paper passport had been found in the ruins of the WTC.
[01:57:18.309 --> 01:57:25.616]  A month ago, new photos were released which apparently show Flight 77 hijackers Nawaz al-Wazi and Saleem al-Hamazi
[01:57:26.332 --> 01:57:30.054]  Undergoing security checks at Washington Dulles International Airport.
[01:57:30.094 --> 01:57:35.177]  This is, of course, to reinforce the official story of 9-11, which is crumbling under scrutiny.
[01:57:35.778 --> 01:57:39.900]  We'll come back, take your calls, get more into this, and call the thumb scanning tanning salon.
[01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:42.261]  Stay with us.
[01:57:43.422 --> 01:57:50.246]  Introducing... Big Brother.
[01:57:50.906 --> 01:57:51.907]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.666 --> 01:57:53.746]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.407 --> 01:57:55.247]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.007 --> 01:57:56.868]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.888 --> 01:58:01.349]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.749 --> 01:58:05.871]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.771 --> 01:58:09.792]  All right, into hour number three.
[01:58:11.012 --> 01:58:12.453]  Found out there is a, uh,
[01:58:13.610 --> 01:58:15.472]  Tanning Salon up in the Dallas area.
[01:58:15.492 --> 01:58:16.933]  Thumb scanning people that come in.
[01:58:16.953 --> 01:58:18.334]  This is happening all over the place now.
[01:58:18.354 --> 01:58:19.875]  We're going to call them coming up in the next segment.
[01:58:20.375 --> 01:58:21.997]  Get to all your calls right now though.
[01:58:22.037 --> 01:58:24.879]  Cherise in Texas and Leah in New Mexico and others.
[01:58:25.159 --> 01:58:26.040]  Cherise, go ahead.
[01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:26.660]  Thanks for holding.
[01:58:27.001 --> 01:58:27.581]  Hi Alex.
[01:58:27.861 --> 01:58:28.362]  Hello.
[01:58:28.442 --> 01:58:34.527]  I have a couple of topic related questions, but first of all I wanted to address your little breakdown at the beginning of today's show.
[01:58:34.547 --> 01:58:35.647]  It really touched me.
[01:58:37.069 --> 01:58:42.673]  I'd like to ask that all of your listeners really try to do their very best to remember you in their prayers, meditations,
[01:58:43.806 --> 01:58:45.667]  Whatever the religious beliefs are.
[01:58:46.807 --> 01:58:58.290]  One of the things I was wondering last night as I listened to you, I was on the computer link, that I don't know how you stand it, what you do to keep from just going crazy, to come across all of the information that you do.
[01:58:58.850 --> 01:59:04.492]  Well, it's my whole life, and I know they're bad men, bad women, they're pure evil, they enjoy all this.
[01:59:05.616 --> 01:59:06.918]  I'm honored to stand against them.
[01:59:06.958 --> 01:59:07.679]  It's fulfilling.
[01:59:07.719 --> 01:59:08.380]  It's enlightening.
[01:59:08.420 --> 01:59:09.482]  It's also very painful.
[01:59:10.423 --> 01:59:16.851]  The Bible says in many passages that with wisdom comes... what's the exact passage?
[01:59:17.092 --> 01:59:18.253]  Comes pain.
[01:59:19.175 --> 01:59:21.538]  Comes sorrow is the actual text.
[01:59:22.296 --> 01:59:31.140]  No, I just wanted to remind you and everybody, and I've had to do this for myself for the same reasons, and David Icke says it in his books, and for a long time I thought, well that's just stupid.
[01:59:31.180 --> 01:59:33.981]  Why know all this stuff and then talk about love being the only answer?
[01:59:34.061 --> 01:59:38.243]  It sounds simplistic, but it really isn't, and that's really the only weapon that we have against it.
[01:59:40.509 --> 01:59:42.611]  But as far as my questions... Well, let me just say this.
[01:59:42.691 --> 01:59:46.054]  If we love people, we're going to stand up for them.
[01:59:46.074 --> 01:59:47.315]  We're going to stand up against evil.
[01:59:47.335 --> 01:59:51.759]  If we have love, we will be compelled, far beyond driven, to fight this.
[01:59:52.139 --> 01:59:52.800]  That's correct.
[01:59:53.701 --> 01:59:54.041]  I agree.
[01:59:54.061 --> 01:59:56.763]  Go ahead and make your point.
[01:59:56.783 --> 01:59:57.404]  I'm sorry.
[01:59:57.424 --> 01:59:59.426]  Well, I was thinking... Well, that was basically it.
[01:59:59.506 --> 02:00:02.869]  I just really wanted people to, you know, get out and study.
[02:00:02.889 --> 02:00:06.872]  You know, there's the internet, there's bookstores, there's a million different ways not to sit around and just go,
[02:00:09.011 --> 02:00:13.875]  You know, and just be a sheeple and listen to what you're fed, you know, through our current media.
[02:00:14.615 --> 02:00:25.063]  And then there's you, you know, and you've got links to newspaper articles and... Everything we claim, everything we claim, we neurotically link to.
[02:00:26.144 --> 02:00:26.904]  Yes, yes.
[02:00:28.145 --> 02:00:31.207]  And I think that this is a very good job that you're doing.
[02:00:31.367 --> 02:00:32.628]  Well, thank you and God bless.
[02:00:33.029 --> 02:00:34.650]  Let's talk to Lee in New Mexico.
[02:00:34.670 --> 02:00:35.570]  Lee, you're on the air.
[02:00:35.651 --> 02:00:36.091]  Go ahead.
[02:00:37.608 --> 02:00:39.449]  Yeah, greetings in the name of Yahweh.
[02:00:39.469 --> 02:00:40.370]  Thank you.
[02:00:40.770 --> 02:00:42.291]  You're more than welcome, sir.
[02:00:42.311 --> 02:00:46.414]  You're the man of Ephesians 6 here, that you are.
[02:00:47.475 --> 02:00:53.099]  Thank you for breaking down, because if you didn't break down, people won't get the message.
[02:00:53.399 --> 02:01:02.345]  You are a compassionate gentleman, a man of God, and you simply just want to see this evil annihilated.
[02:01:03.246 --> 02:01:05.207]  And that is what's going to happen.
[02:01:06.055 --> 02:01:35.448]  The people who are doing this evil and perpetuate this murder and treason again, patriots such as yourself and other people who want to see this Constitutional Republic withstand for as long as possible, these same people must realize that one minute after they leave their bodies, Alex, the one that they're serving, Satan, Lucifer, he's going to stand up before Yahweh, he's going to say,
[02:01:36.124 --> 02:01:42.148]  They've done this evil, so if you let them live, then why are you sending me to Hades?
[02:01:43.169 --> 02:01:48.633]  They don't believe it, and they're comfortable, and they're shaking their heads right now.
[02:01:48.693 --> 02:01:50.494]  Those who are listening, they're doing evil.
[02:01:50.554 --> 02:01:53.756]  The New World Order, Globalist, Illuminati, whatever they're going to call themselves.
[02:01:55.297 --> 02:01:56.959]  Well, I got news for them.
[02:01:57.379 --> 02:02:00.001]  This black man, you know, will just come out and say it.
[02:02:00.901 --> 02:02:04.364]  You serve Satan now, you're going to serve him for eternity.
[02:02:05.325 --> 02:02:07.206]  There is no freedom from Satan.
[02:02:07.326 --> 02:02:08.966]  Once he gets to you, that's it.
[02:02:09.947 --> 02:02:10.387]  That's it.
[02:02:10.407 --> 02:02:13.808]  So, I'm glad that you broke down, sir.
[02:02:14.829 --> 02:02:15.609]  I'm glad you did.
[02:02:15.629 --> 02:02:18.270]  God bless you.
[02:02:18.730 --> 02:02:23.552]  I was just thinking about how they kill children with these vaccines and it just, it just tears my heart out.
[02:02:24.796 --> 02:02:26.858]  Alex, you're a great American.
[02:02:26.898 --> 02:02:27.838]  You're a patriot.
[02:02:28.139 --> 02:02:28.719]  And you know what?
[02:02:28.759 --> 02:02:31.001]  If you were running for president, I would vote for you.
[02:02:31.121 --> 02:02:32.402]  Oh, I'm just an average person.
[02:02:32.442 --> 02:02:33.162]  I love you guys.
[02:02:33.182 --> 02:02:33.743]  God bless you.
[02:02:33.783 --> 02:02:34.483]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:34.884 --> 02:02:35.684]  My friends, stay with us.
[02:02:47.532 --> 02:02:53.033]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:53.453 --> 02:02:57.674]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:02:57.914 --> 02:03:04.936]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:05.316 --> 02:03:11.418]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:11.578 --> 02:03:12.778]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:13.138 --> 02:03:16.082]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:03:16.242 --> 02:03:18.244]  Eliminate the cost, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:03:18.565 --> 02:03:25.793]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:03:26.114 --> 02:03:29.498]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:03:29.918 --> 02:03:34.562]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time that's 866-885-6625 call today!
[02:03:45.658 --> 02:03:48.662]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:03:49.003 --> 02:03:57.814]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments, like a local or national emergency.
[02:03:58.135 --> 02:04:02.841]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:04:03.281 --> 02:04:10.008]  The Berkelite is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:04:10.409 --> 02:04:22.201]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:22.661 --> 02:04:27.125]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:04:27.285 --> 02:04:29.727]  Get the Murky Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:29.787 --> 02:04:31.608]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:04:31.628 --> 02:04:32.829]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:04:32.889 --> 02:04:34.350]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:04:34.370 --> 02:04:35.431]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:44.429 --> 02:04:45.930]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:04:46.110 --> 02:04:49.193]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:04:49.333 --> 02:04:53.236]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:04:53.296 --> 02:04:57.540]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:04:57.860 --> 02:05:01.643]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:05:01.783 --> 02:05:03.585]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:05:04.165 --> 02:05:07.066]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[02:05:07.106 --> 02:05:11.808]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:05:11.988 --> 02:05:15.050]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:05:15.210 --> 02:05:18.071]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:05:18.571 --> 02:05:24.674]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:05:25.214 --> 02:05:28.996]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:05:29.416 --> 02:05:30.777]  Order your video today.
[02:05:31.177 --> 02:05:32.197]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[02:05:32.217 --> 02:05:34.198]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[02:05:34.218 --> 02:05:35.779]  Or go to my website, Infowars.com.
[02:05:46.340 --> 02:05:52.363]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:52.963 --> 02:05:56.005]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:57.385 --> 02:06:03.868]  Alright, we had Debbie Morrow, who lives up in the Dallas area, on in the last hour to talk about big, murky water filters.
[02:06:04.989 --> 02:06:13.113]  And she told about how she bought 10 tans, likes to tan sometime, and then went into the tanning salon and they said, we got a thumb scan, you gotta scan your fingers.
[02:06:14.120 --> 02:06:16.762]  Uh, to do it, each time you come in, she said, no way.
[02:06:16.782 --> 02:06:18.663]  And I said, well, you've got to show your driver's license then.
[02:06:19.024 --> 02:06:25.348]  The point is, this is going in as part of this cashless society control grid for the new national ID card system.
[02:06:25.368 --> 02:06:26.509]  This will be your identifier.
[02:06:26.749 --> 02:06:28.590]  This is how you'll pay your national sales tax.
[02:06:28.610 --> 02:06:30.912]  This is how they'll track and trace everything you do.
[02:06:31.750 --> 02:06:33.511]  I'm not even saying this tanning place is bad.
[02:06:33.571 --> 02:06:42.935]  A salesman came in, you know, to their corporate office, I'm sure, and we found out, indeed, it is a chain, Palm Beach Tan, and I guarantee you said, oh, it's a great new system, it's real fun, it'll stop fraud.
[02:06:42.955 --> 02:06:48.358]  Here it is, and it'll stop people from, you know, giving folks, you know, fake names and using other people's memberships.
[02:06:49.895 --> 02:06:50.836]  And it's so convenient.
[02:06:50.916 --> 02:06:53.577]  But the Feds say this is the plan for tracking and tracing.
[02:06:53.617 --> 02:07:00.622]  So, we're going to call the Bedford suburb of Dallas, Palm Beach, Tann first and see if they'll talk to us.
[02:07:01.142 --> 02:07:04.104]  And if they don't, we'll call one of the Hearst locations.
[02:07:04.444 --> 02:07:05.465]  Go ahead and call, Stephanie.
[02:07:08.607 --> 02:07:09.847]  She is dialing the number.
[02:07:10.968 --> 02:07:13.450]  And we're going to talk to them here live on air.
[02:07:16.512 --> 02:07:17.152]  Alright, here we go.
[02:07:20.359 --> 02:07:23.121]  Hey man, how you doing?
[02:07:23.141 --> 02:07:31.987]  This is Alex Jones with the Syndicated Radio Broadcast, and I was just curious about tanning salons in general, and if you could answer my questions, we will send you some free prizes.
[02:07:35.229 --> 02:07:35.789]  Hello ma'am?
[02:07:37.831 --> 02:07:38.571]  What did she just say?
[02:07:41.173 --> 02:07:47.017]  Okay, and I was going to send them one of my videos to educate them, America Destroyed by Design, that gets into the biometrics, my first film.
[02:07:48.498 --> 02:07:49.058]  Let's try to
[02:07:49.841 --> 02:07:51.682]  Let's try to call the other number.
[02:07:51.722 --> 02:07:53.103]  Let's call the Hirsch location.
[02:07:54.984 --> 02:07:56.164]  Let's go ahead and call that.
[02:08:02.087 --> 02:08:02.507]  Here we go.
[02:08:02.527 --> 02:08:08.210]  Thank you for calling Palm Beach.
[02:08:08.230 --> 02:08:09.170]  Hey ma'am, how you doing?
[02:08:09.190 --> 02:08:10.051]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:08:10.091 --> 02:08:14.433]  I've got a national syndicated radio show and we're live on the air right now and I was just... Hello?
[02:08:16.184 --> 02:08:17.684]  Man, I tell you, our audience is so big.
[02:08:17.744 --> 02:08:20.725]  I guarantee you there's people out there that don't like us who called these people.
[02:08:21.285 --> 02:08:23.465]  I shouldn't have mentioned I was going to call them last hour.
[02:08:23.505 --> 02:08:24.205]  I should have just done it.
[02:08:24.545 --> 02:08:26.426]  And, you know, we've got to tell them we're calling from a show.
[02:08:26.466 --> 02:08:27.366]  That's the only thing we've got to do.
[02:08:27.406 --> 02:08:29.646]  But they just hung up on us again.
[02:08:29.666 --> 02:08:32.307]  Hey, Stephanie, do me a favor.
[02:08:32.367 --> 02:08:34.667]  Call them off air and say, hey, we're not on air now.
[02:08:35.647 --> 02:08:38.348]  We're just curious about the finger readers you've got in.
[02:08:39.108 --> 02:08:40.068]  Can you tell us about it?
[02:08:40.848 --> 02:08:43.589]  And say, hey, this isn't a prank call.
[02:08:43.629 --> 02:08:45.909]  Will you call them or see if somebody called them and warned them?
[02:08:46.758 --> 02:08:49.639]  Well, you do that right now, and then I want you to come on air and tell us what they told you.
[02:08:50.319 --> 02:08:56.542]  Why don't you call the Bedford one back, and thank you for doing all that.
[02:08:56.602 --> 02:08:57.542]  I really appreciate it.
[02:08:59.543 --> 02:09:01.284]  I want you to hear this from them, you know?
[02:09:01.884 --> 02:09:05.045]  I mean, it's important to do that.
[02:09:05.405 --> 02:09:09.967]  Either they think it's a prank call, or, more likely, someone called them.
[02:09:10.227 --> 02:09:12.088]  Because we were up front about what we were about to do.
[02:09:12.108 --> 02:09:14.809]  We have a lot of listeners in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
[02:09:15.717 --> 02:09:16.558]  What are they afraid of?
[02:09:16.618 --> 02:09:23.702]  I mean, if they're proud of it, I'm sure we can get them some customers in there to go underneath the UV.
[02:09:25.543 --> 02:09:26.024]  I don't know.
[02:09:26.044 --> 02:09:32.988]  If I'm going to lay out in the sun, I'd rather lay out under the big, pretty green trees at the park and drink some lemonade.
[02:09:33.008 --> 02:09:40.113]  But as soon as Stephanie finds out what's going on, we'll bring her up on air and then I'll go to these loaded phone lines.
[02:09:41.576 --> 02:09:43.497]  But Stephanie does such a great job.
[02:09:43.537 --> 02:09:47.738]  We should all be thankful for her, and Jason, and Scott, and those that run the broadcast.
[02:09:47.758 --> 02:09:48.458]  They're just wonderful.
[02:09:48.518 --> 02:09:51.119]  And I'm so thankful for the GCN Radio Network.
[02:09:51.139 --> 02:09:52.880]  You know, they've never tried to censor me.
[02:09:53.340 --> 02:09:55.080]  They've never told me what I can and can't say.
[02:09:55.821 --> 02:09:58.901]  And I can tell you that I had a different experience when I started out in radio here locally.
[02:09:58.921 --> 02:10:04.263]  They would try to, and my show got number one ratings, so they didn't have much control, but finally fired me because I wouldn't be controlled.
[02:10:04.303 --> 02:10:09.965]  And I'm so blessed and honored to be on the GCN Radio Network, the Genesis Communication Radio Network.
[02:10:10.643 --> 02:10:13.905]  And their website is GCNlive.com.
[02:10:14.985 --> 02:10:17.746]  But I guess he's on the phone talking to them now.
[02:10:17.806 --> 02:10:21.228]  Must be having some success talking to them.
[02:10:21.248 --> 02:10:22.068]  Stephanie, what happened?
[02:10:23.589 --> 02:10:24.329]  Are you on air now?
[02:10:24.349 --> 02:10:24.909]  I'm on air now.
[02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:25.730]  Okay, good.
[02:10:25.750 --> 02:10:26.830]  Well, it wasn't much.
[02:10:26.850 --> 02:10:27.891]  They're really friendly about it.
[02:10:27.911 --> 02:10:29.692]  He just said, yeah, they do have finger scanners.
[02:10:29.752 --> 02:10:35.434]  It's just to make sure that no one uses your identity, uses your pass.
[02:10:35.854 --> 02:10:37.275]  Did you ask them why they hung up?
[02:10:38.268 --> 02:10:40.270]  No, I don't think he... I didn't ask that at all.
[02:10:40.290 --> 02:10:44.434]  I don't think he was aware that I was involved with us calling before.
[02:10:44.454 --> 02:10:45.996]  Well, do me a favor.
[02:10:46.016 --> 02:10:46.856]  You did a great job.
[02:10:47.377 --> 02:10:47.717]  Okay.
[02:10:48.118 --> 02:10:49.339]  I'll call him during the break.
[02:10:49.359 --> 02:10:50.300]  Which number did you call?
[02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:51.381]  I called Bedford.
[02:10:52.094 --> 02:10:57.916]  Okay, we'll call them back and say, hey, this is Stephanie, maybe they'll take it better from you because you've got a nicer voice than mine.
[02:10:58.316 --> 02:11:04.557]  Why don't you call up and just say, hey, listen, we've got a syndicated show, listeners talk about this, we just think it's interesting, will you come on and talk about it?
[02:11:04.957 --> 02:11:05.898]  Okay.
[02:11:06.158 --> 02:11:11.319]  And then if he says no, ask, well, how many locations do you have and how many of these scanners do you have?
[02:11:12.063 --> 02:11:12.343]  All right.
[02:11:12.483 --> 02:11:13.845]  So calling back, you're wonderful.
[02:11:14.145 --> 02:11:15.726]  I'm going to go ahead and take a call now, though.
[02:11:16.167 --> 02:11:20.910]  Let's talk to Jacqueline in Arizona, and then I'll talk to her while you're busy over there.
[02:11:21.631 --> 02:11:22.452]  Jacqueline, hello.
[02:11:22.492 --> 02:11:23.072]  You're on the air.
[02:11:23.412 --> 02:11:24.073]  Hi, Alex.
[02:11:25.154 --> 02:11:26.675]  I have to say that I'm a longtime listener.
[02:11:26.735 --> 02:11:30.098]  My dad's been listening since 98, and I've been listening for about three years.
[02:11:30.598 --> 02:11:32.120]  Well, thank you.
[02:11:32.140 --> 02:11:32.200]  I'm 23.
[02:11:32.340 --> 02:11:33.601]  I have a two-year-old son.
[02:11:33.681 --> 02:11:38.045]  He's about three and a half months shy of two, and I'm calling about the vaccination.
[02:11:38.705 --> 02:11:40.887]  When I first found out I was pregnant, my dad
[02:11:44.619 --> 02:11:45.279]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:11:45.459 --> 02:11:59.343]  Okay, my dad found out tons of information about it and we just went through and you could find it on the internet and determined not to vaccinate my son and he has only progressed in huge amounts since that decision.
[02:11:59.843 --> 02:12:01.484]  You know, he started walking at about eight months.
[02:12:02.004 --> 02:12:04.625]  He's totally healthy, never been sick.
[02:12:05.885 --> 02:12:07.826]  I work at the hospital, they tell everyone about it.
[02:12:07.906 --> 02:12:09.006]  Same thing with my children.
[02:12:11.575 --> 02:12:15.077]  I just thought I had to call in and tell you that he is a definite testimony to that.
[02:12:17.138 --> 02:12:25.644]  And then, we've aired the newscast, we've read the news articles all over the country saying, you must take it, it's the law, we'll come arrest you, we'll come get you if you don't.
[02:12:26.185 --> 02:12:27.405]  Are they doing that in Arizona?
[02:12:27.465 --> 02:12:28.506]  Are they running ads like that?
[02:12:29.347 --> 02:12:30.087]  No, they aren't.
[02:12:30.247 --> 02:12:33.990]  I do get nasty looks and talked to by the pediatrician when I go in.
[02:12:35.071 --> 02:12:39.614]  My co-workers tend to give me the ugly eye when I do talk about it.
[02:12:41.375 --> 02:12:42.516]  Because you're trying to save them.
[02:12:42.736 --> 02:12:47.319]  And look, if vaccines were purified, done properly, they can do some good.
[02:12:47.620 --> 02:12:51.142]  The problem is that they have total liability protection.
[02:12:51.483 --> 02:12:53.164]  They admit they've been poisoning people.
[02:12:53.204 --> 02:12:54.145]  You cannot trust them.
[02:12:54.745 --> 02:12:56.086]  And people have to make their own decisions.
[02:12:56.166 --> 02:13:00.469]  I'm not a doctor, but I've had the doctors and scientists on here by the scores going over this.
[02:13:01.950 --> 02:13:06.654]  And when two or three confirm it, it's definitely God's will in the situation.
[02:13:08.109 --> 02:13:09.970]  Well, anything else you'd like to add?
[02:13:10.450 --> 02:13:11.950]  No, well, he's a Berkey baby.
[02:13:12.110 --> 02:13:15.051]  He's only drank Berkey water since he was born, basically.
[02:13:15.091 --> 02:13:20.313]  So he's not drinking the fluoride and the mercury and the... Nope, and his teeth are definitely strong.
[02:13:21.473 --> 02:13:23.374]  Well, that's wonderful, and you're certainly blessed.
[02:13:23.534 --> 02:13:24.274]  Good to hear from you.
[02:13:24.935 --> 02:13:26.195]  What an exciting call.
[02:13:27.295 --> 02:13:29.116]  Oh, Dylan in Texas.
[02:13:29.176 --> 02:13:30.076]  Dylan, you're on the air.
[02:13:30.136 --> 02:13:30.576]  Go ahead.
[02:13:30.596 --> 02:13:33.977]  I hope you're in fine health and strength today, Alex.
[02:13:36.224 --> 02:13:43.407]  I'm a minister in the service of Jesus Christ, and I appreciated your blossoming earlier in today's program.
[02:13:43.607 --> 02:13:44.747]  You did not break down.
[02:13:45.567 --> 02:13:47.468]  You blossomed in the Spirit of Christ.
[02:13:48.588 --> 02:13:59.272]  Those of us who believe, and those of us who want to believe, we look up to the greatest martyr, the creator of the universe, the Savior, Jesus Christ.
[02:13:59.372 --> 02:14:04.954]  When He walked upon the earth, He stood to glorify Abba, Father, the Father.
[02:14:05.342 --> 02:14:06.962]  He was not going to submit to man.
[02:14:07.522 --> 02:14:09.083]  He was about his father's business.
[02:14:10.303 --> 02:14:12.404]  He, quote-unquote, broke down.
[02:14:12.864 --> 02:14:14.384]  It's not actually a breaking down.
[02:14:15.244 --> 02:14:17.125]  It's part of the compassion process.
[02:14:18.325 --> 02:14:26.407]  And some of the strongest leaders in the world who have come to know the love of Christ have, quote-unquote, broken down.
[02:14:27.527 --> 02:14:29.707]  Tears are part of the strength of Christ.
[02:14:31.188 --> 02:14:32.508]  And I'm very proud
[02:14:33.504 --> 02:14:37.027]  To see you honestly display that emotion.
[02:14:38.689 --> 02:14:41.831]  Well, I went back to that place I was in yesterday and I couldn't control it.
[02:14:41.931 --> 02:14:46.035]  I mean, just thinking about it, it's just... No, it was a comfort.
[02:14:46.075 --> 02:14:47.536]  It did strengthen me.
[02:14:48.497 --> 02:14:53.221]  It's just facing the full horror of the New World Order and what they're doing to the innocents is very painful.
[02:14:54.542 --> 02:14:58.826]  I really appreciate even what you talked about earlier in the program about taking care to
[02:15:00.799 --> 02:15:07.607]  Provide a safe haven for a little lizard who had found its way onto your car and then got lost in your car.
[02:15:10.130 --> 02:15:16.597]  Caring for little animals and such, I myself, I love little animals.
[02:15:17.158 --> 02:15:21.203]  I'd have to pray and pray if I had to kill anything bigger than a lizard.
[02:15:21.843 --> 02:15:23.504]  Just to make myself feel better.
[02:15:23.564 --> 02:15:34.089]  Well, my point is that I'm driving on the road and there's this lizard hanging on at 50 miles an hour and I pull over and he fell off the front, was literally holding on to the edge by my window.
[02:15:34.109 --> 02:15:40.112]  I use that example of how I've been a hard-hearted person.
[02:15:40.432 --> 02:15:41.233]  I'm mean.
[02:15:41.653 --> 02:15:42.353]  I don't like bullies.
[02:15:42.373 --> 02:15:43.234]  I don't like tyranny.
[02:15:44.715 --> 02:15:47.116]  My heart gets softer and softer and softer.
[02:15:47.136 --> 02:15:49.217]  It's been quite an interesting process.
[02:15:49.986 --> 02:15:54.469]  That actually is the pathway to the strength of the Lord Almighty.
[02:15:54.929 --> 02:16:04.615]  We are only callous and cold when we do not feel we have the resistance we need to face the dark forces of this world.
[02:16:04.635 --> 02:16:05.716]  Well, I have to tell you that
[02:16:06.639 --> 02:16:08.560]  I'd say I don't really have fear of the New World Order.
[02:16:08.580 --> 02:16:10.001]  I have fear of not stopping it.
[02:16:10.041 --> 02:16:13.262]  But I always have that lingering fear in the back of my mind.
[02:16:13.763 --> 02:16:15.964]  And after yesterday, there is zero fear.
[02:16:16.024 --> 02:16:20.346]  In fact, I am honored and committed to go all the way in the fight against the New World Order.
[02:16:21.601 --> 02:16:28.485]  Well I really appreciate it Alex, and I just wish everyone would read their Bill of Rights today, and God bless you Alex.
[02:16:28.625 --> 02:16:30.487]  Take care, good to hear from you.
[02:16:30.507 --> 02:16:32.688]  We'll go ahead and go to another caller, we'll probably have to hold them over.
[02:16:33.128 --> 02:16:35.209]  Charles in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:16:35.349 --> 02:16:36.190]  Hey, it's Charlie from St.
[02:16:36.210 --> 02:16:37.091]  Cloud, how you doing there?
[02:16:37.111 --> 02:16:37.911]  Good to talk to you.
[02:16:38.171 --> 02:16:44.135]  Okay, yeah, I called a couple weeks ago about it, this is your program last night on the shortwave, and you said something about
[02:16:45.006 --> 02:16:48.067]  I don't have the bill in front of me.
[02:16:48.087 --> 02:16:50.708]  Did you see his last State of the Union address?
[02:16:50.728 --> 02:16:51.548]  No, I didn't.
[02:16:51.568 --> 02:16:54.069]  Well, they've called for the biggest blanket amnesty ever to anyone
[02:17:03.433 --> 02:17:04.754]  From anywhere in the world.
[02:17:05.174 --> 02:17:07.836]  We always talk about Latin America because that's the majority.
[02:17:07.876 --> 02:17:13.059]  And now this new amnesty, they're going to pay to bring people here, unskilled workers.
[02:17:13.439 --> 02:17:16.742]  They're going to accelerate the layoffs of high tech seven times.
[02:17:17.222 --> 02:17:19.423]  That's the General Accounting Office's own numbers.
[02:17:20.764 --> 02:17:25.007]  And my point is, is that illegals from Latin America
[02:17:26.477 --> 02:17:33.302]  Only are given a waiver to not biometrically scan when they come into the country, but citizens have to leave and others have to come in.
[02:17:33.662 --> 02:17:36.844]  So my point is it has nothing to do with Homeland Security or stopping terrorism.
[02:17:37.185 --> 02:17:37.685]  Stay there.
[02:17:38.145 --> 02:17:39.206]  Charlie, we'll come back to you.
[02:17:39.226 --> 02:17:40.067]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:17:45.473 --> 02:17:48.355]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:17:48.715 --> 02:17:51.597]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:17:51.817 --> 02:17:58.001]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[02:17:58.381 --> 02:18:05.706]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[02:18:05.886 --> 02:18:09.949]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[02:18:10.249 --> 02:18:15.773]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[02:18:15.993 --> 02:18:29.101]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.
[02:18:29.301 --> 02:18:33.124]  Get this hard-to-find information by ordering Food and Places U.S.A.
[02:18:33.324 --> 02:18:37.867]  now for only $29, plus shipping and handling, by calling New Millennium at 888
[02:18:44.789 --> 02:18:46.329]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:18:46.469 --> 02:18:47.630]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:18:47.790 --> 02:18:51.211]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:18:51.311 --> 02:18:51.751]  Phenol!
[02:18:52.051 --> 02:18:59.113]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:18:59.673 --> 02:19:03.574]  The FDA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:19:03.674 --> 02:19:04.114]  Fragrance?
[02:19:04.494 --> 02:19:09.256]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:19:09.396 --> 02:19:14.057]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[02:19:14.297 --> 02:19:16.858]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my CalBen shampoo.
[02:19:17.118 --> 02:19:20.519]  Well, like all of the products from the CalBen Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.

[02:19:46.392 --> 02:19:48.133]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[02:19:48.644 --> 02:19:52.066]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[02:19:52.567 --> 02:19:53.247]  Let's update.
[02:19:53.747 --> 02:19:57.210]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[02:19:57.870 --> 02:20:01.592]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[02:20:02.273 --> 02:20:03.214]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[02:20:03.254 --> 02:20:05.575]  dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[02:20:06.095 --> 02:20:06.996]  Today, the U.S.
[02:20:07.036 --> 02:20:09.257]  dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[02:20:09.658 --> 02:20:11.179]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[02:20:11.759 --> 02:20:13.720]  January of 2002, the gold spot was 283.
[02:20:15.071 --> 02:20:19.935]  January of 04, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[02:20:20.936 --> 02:20:23.118]  Gold is moving, equities are treading water.
[02:20:23.498 --> 02:20:26.140]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[02:20:26.701 --> 02:20:28.062]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[02:20:28.502 --> 02:20:30.224]  Physical possession, private gold.
[02:20:30.644 --> 02:20:32.606]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[02:20:33.006 --> 02:20:35.128]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[02:20:37.310 --> 02:20:39.451]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.
[02:20:39.832 --> 02:20:40.132]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:44.650 --> 02:20:45.251]  We're good to go.
[02:21:02.345 --> 02:21:05.487]  This is why the incidence of disease is so much lower when young.
[02:21:05.888 --> 02:21:07.709]  This is why you're skinnier when young.
[02:21:08.229 --> 02:21:10.851]  Looking and feeling young is a direct result of your chemistry.
[02:21:11.272 --> 02:21:14.854]  Science brings us closer to the threshold of eternal youth every day.
[02:21:15.455 --> 02:21:18.217]  Cocoon GH is a sublingual form of growth hormone.
[02:21:18.597 --> 02:21:27.103]  When used twice a day, people report deep sleep, improved mood, memory and energy, losses of body fat, improved strength and sex drive.
[02:21:27.643 --> 02:21:30.705]  Reduction of joint pains, improved blood sugar, and more.
[02:21:30.965 --> 02:21:32.966]  Improve your chemistry and improve your life.
[02:21:33.186 --> 02:21:34.526]  Satisfaction guaranteed.
[02:21:34.626 --> 02:21:34.987]  Call 800-814-5031 800-814-5031 800-814-5031
[02:21:53.777 --> 02:21:57.060]  Another ragtag band, declaring independence.
[02:21:57.080 --> 02:21:59.321]  Thanks to the renegades, we're free today.
[02:22:21.678 --> 02:22:24.479]  Alright, during the break, I was going to keep that caller over.
[02:22:24.539 --> 02:22:26.200]  I forgot what he was talking about, but he hung up.
[02:22:26.680 --> 02:22:27.620]  Charlie in Florida.
[02:22:28.761 --> 02:22:32.342]  But during the break I called this Palm Beach TAN.
[02:22:32.402 --> 02:22:36.583]  It's on top of a huge corporation all over that area of Texas.
[02:22:36.723 --> 02:22:39.064]  And it was for donations, press 1.
[02:22:39.164 --> 02:22:40.964]  For corporate advertising, press 2.
[02:22:41.304 --> 02:22:42.525]  For media inquiries, press 3.
[02:22:44.011 --> 02:22:47.093]  Some type of big outfit, but we talked to their employees.
[02:22:47.153 --> 02:22:55.098]  Every location up there in Dallas has these thumb scanners to be able to go in there and activate your membership.
[02:22:55.138 --> 02:22:56.879]  I mean, it's out of control, folks.
[02:22:57.720 --> 02:22:58.921]  Just one more example.
[02:22:59.461 --> 02:23:02.963]  And the police have tried to say in Arlington and areas of Denver, you better do it.
[02:23:02.983 --> 02:23:04.084]  You better put these in.
[02:23:05.165 --> 02:23:06.526]  No law, just you better do it.
[02:23:06.546 --> 02:23:08.107]  Because we say so.
[02:23:09.928 --> 02:23:12.750]  I guess Junior in Tennessee is up next, and Tom and
[02:23:13.408 --> 02:23:14.028]  Jim and others.
[02:23:14.068 --> 02:23:14.869]  Go ahead, Junior.
[02:23:15.529 --> 02:23:16.529]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[02:23:17.229 --> 02:23:18.570]  Just doing a broadcast, my friend.
[02:23:19.550 --> 02:23:21.731]  Cool.
[02:23:21.751 --> 02:23:29.174]  I wanted to thank you for the work you're doing for this country and for the bravery and everything you have while I was on it.
[02:23:30.074 --> 02:23:36.377]  But anyways, I was surfing on the internet and I come across the website on TomPetty.com, which he's a musician.
[02:23:36.437 --> 02:23:37.317]  He sings rock and roll.
[02:23:43.410 --> 02:23:51.173]  You go to his website on the news, this Tom Petty signs letter to Bush to renew gun ban.
[02:23:52.613 --> 02:23:57.515]  Yeah, well, I mean, we controlled all the music we played or what we did.
[02:23:57.535 --> 02:23:58.915]  I mean, I don't agree with a lot of these people.
[02:23:58.955 --> 02:24:01.596]  I didn't know that about Tom Petty, but he's a gun grabber.
[02:24:01.616 --> 02:24:04.157]  Well, there's about 50 of them in this letter on his website.
[02:24:04.177 --> 02:24:07.378]  There's about 50 musicians and actors that signed it.
[02:24:07.739 --> 02:24:10.560]  Well, I can play David von Kleist's version of it.
[02:24:10.580 --> 02:24:11.440]  I think it's probably better.
[02:24:12.293 --> 02:24:15.134]  It was, and the thing about it is, it was an advertisement.
[02:24:15.515 --> 02:24:19.316]  It read on the letter, it says, uh... Let's see if I can find it.
[02:24:20.397 --> 02:24:24.379]  It was an advertisement through the Violence Policy Center.
[02:24:24.399 --> 02:24:26.660]  See, Tom Petty thinks he's not backing down.
[02:24:26.700 --> 02:24:27.740]  He thinks guns are evil.
[02:24:27.780 --> 02:24:28.321]  He's a liberal.
[02:24:28.521 --> 02:24:28.741]  Yeah.
[02:24:29.061 --> 02:24:33.103]  This ad was paid for by the Violence Policy Center Trauma Foundation.
[02:24:33.403 --> 02:24:34.744]  Oh, good old Josh Sugarman.
[02:24:37.165 --> 02:24:38.365]  Learn something every day.
[02:24:38.386 --> 02:24:41.327]  Yeah, I just thought I'd pass that along to you and everything.
[02:24:43.183 --> 02:24:43.603]  Interesting.
[02:24:43.643 --> 02:24:44.184]  Anything else?
[02:24:44.664 --> 02:24:45.085]  Uh, no.
[02:24:45.105 --> 02:24:46.466]  I just wanted to pass that along.
[02:24:47.246 --> 02:24:50.629]  Well, we'll just use Tom Petty for good, even if he's out there doing bad.
[02:24:50.649 --> 02:24:51.470]  He's got a good song.
[02:24:52.911 --> 02:24:53.531]  Pass it along.
[02:24:53.992 --> 02:24:54.973]  Alright, good to hear from you.
[02:24:54.993 --> 02:24:55.973]  I appreciate it, Junior.
[02:24:56.514 --> 02:24:57.775]  Uh, Tom in Ohio.
[02:24:57.835 --> 02:24:58.616]  Tom, go ahead.
[02:25:00.577 --> 02:25:02.138]  Yeah, this is Tom from Bowling Green.
[02:25:02.419 --> 02:25:02.719]  Yes, sir.
[02:25:02.739 --> 02:25:03.039]  Ohio.
[02:25:03.940 --> 02:25:04.580]  Yeah, Alex?
[02:25:04.801 --> 02:25:05.081]  Yes.
[02:25:05.961 --> 02:25:10.485]  Yeah, hey, I'm your fan for three, probably better than three years.
[02:25:10.505 --> 02:25:11.986]  Do me a big favor and turn your radio off.
[02:25:12.026 --> 02:25:12.667]  Yeah, I just done.
[02:25:13.087 --> 02:25:13.307]  Okay.
[02:25:13.868 --> 02:25:16.150]  Hey, I've hand the tapes out.
[02:25:16.190 --> 02:25:16.830]  I've pushed them.
[02:25:16.870 --> 02:25:19.212]  I've got guys working on the house right now.
[02:25:19.993 --> 02:25:20.913]  I gave them to them.
[02:25:20.933 --> 02:25:22.094]  I woke them up.
[02:25:22.935 --> 02:25:24.336]  I wake everybody up, Alex.
[02:25:24.496 --> 02:25:26.338]  I'm on full charge.
[02:25:26.718 --> 02:25:28.620]  A lot of people are waking up in Ohio.
[02:25:28.640 --> 02:25:30.441]  We've got a couple of affiliates up there now.
[02:25:30.461 --> 02:25:31.742]  Well, great.
[02:25:31.842 --> 02:25:33.584]  What channels are they on?
[02:25:33.744 --> 02:25:34.004]  AM?
[02:25:34.024 --> 02:25:39.528]  Yeah, they're two AM stations and they're listed at GCNlive.com in the affiliates section.
[02:25:39.568 --> 02:25:40.549]  We're very thankful for them.
[02:25:41.070 --> 02:25:42.551]  Well, I asked my kids to look that up.
[02:25:43.406 --> 02:25:49.591]  And in other words, I've got a gospel preacher that just blows these other preachers off the street and everywhere.
[02:25:50.552 --> 02:25:54.355]  I mean, I gave him your tapes, I gave him everything, but he was woke up before.
[02:25:55.416 --> 02:26:00.140]  He works in a, well, one has to say, he's been at it 40 years.
[02:26:01.321 --> 02:26:03.022]  He's a precious person, I mean.
[02:26:04.103 --> 02:26:05.464]  I gave him my heart, boy.
[02:26:05.504 --> 02:26:06.545]  He's just preaching.
[02:26:06.965 --> 02:26:12.670]  Sundays he preaches and he sets the church on fire with Jesus, every Sunday.
[02:26:13.673 --> 02:26:19.994]  Well, he better not street preach in Alabama or New York or California or Texas or he'll get arrested.
[02:26:20.615 --> 02:26:21.515]  Yeah, I know what you mean.
[02:26:21.815 --> 02:26:22.755]  I told you about that.
[02:26:22.815 --> 02:26:24.075]  All part of the new freedom.
[02:26:24.115 --> 02:26:25.516]  Can't preach on a street corner.
[02:26:25.856 --> 02:26:27.056]  All of our wonderful freedoms.
[02:26:28.316 --> 02:26:31.357]  Yeah, what's that have to do with Al-Qaeda that suddenly they're arresting preachers?
[02:26:32.177 --> 02:26:33.157]  It has nothing to do with it.
[02:26:33.177 --> 02:26:34.358]  It's a climate of evil.
[02:26:34.738 --> 02:26:36.538]  And if people can't see it, they're brain dead.
[02:26:37.198 --> 02:26:38.099]  Yes, definitely.
[02:26:39.779 --> 02:26:40.079]  Oh, yes.
[02:26:41.363 --> 02:26:42.644]  I'm waking people up every day.
[02:26:42.724 --> 02:26:46.867]  I woke a man up and he's following me in the Lord.
[02:26:46.887 --> 02:26:50.389]  I packed my car up on Sunday.
[02:26:50.909 --> 02:26:52.650]  We go where there's fire.
[02:26:53.411 --> 02:26:55.012]  Fire with Jesus Christ our Savior.
[02:26:55.672 --> 02:26:57.513]  Well that's exciting and take care my friend.
[02:26:57.573 --> 02:26:58.634]  I appreciate your call.
[02:26:58.654 --> 02:26:59.194]  We'll break.
[02:26:59.775 --> 02:27:01.536]  Come back and talk to Jim in Michigan and others.
[02:27:01.896 --> 02:27:03.437]  Continue with wide open telephones 800-259-9231.
[02:27:07.228 --> 02:27:09.109]  Then I want to get into what's happening in Najaf.
[02:27:09.169 --> 02:27:10.951]  I want to get into the Republican National Convention.
[02:27:11.331 --> 02:27:13.913]  Georgian President warns of war with Russia.
[02:27:13.933 --> 02:27:14.713]  That's pretty serious.
[02:27:15.694 --> 02:27:18.035]  We'll also get into another article out of Indiana.
[02:27:18.075 --> 02:27:20.757]  National Guard unit gets new mission on the home front.
[02:27:22.799 --> 02:27:24.380]  Oh yeah, I can't wait to hear about the new mission.
[02:27:24.880 --> 02:27:27.722]  Porter Goss backed the 95 bill to slash intelligence funding.
[02:27:28.643 --> 02:27:29.403]  And a lot more.
[02:27:29.463 --> 02:27:30.104]  So stay with us.
[02:27:30.124 --> 02:27:30.924]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:31.004 --> 02:27:33.666]  PrisonPlanet.tv is just one of the websites.
[02:27:35.538 --> 02:27:38.539]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.559 --> 02:27:42.241]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.802 --> 02:27:50.484]  We all have busy lives and sometimes that causes us to miss out on the things that are most important to us.
[02:27:51.005 --> 02:27:54.126]  Well, when it comes to Genesis programs, you'll never have to miss out again.
[02:27:54.781 --> 02:28:00.726]  For only $19.95 plus $3 shipping and handling, you can receive an entire month of recorded GCN programs.
[02:28:01.227 --> 02:28:04.850]  That's right, an entire month for only $19.95 plus shipping and handling.
[02:28:05.290 --> 02:28:07.952]  The recordings are in MP3 format and compact disc.
[02:28:08.413 --> 02:28:12.176]  They're playable on computers along with most newer CD and DVD players.
[02:28:12.656 --> 02:28:16.600]  All you need to know is the name of the program you'd like a copy of and the months that it aired.
[02:28:17.120 --> 02:28:20.442]  Don't be left out of current news and information that affects our lives every day.
[02:28:20.782 --> 02:28:26.304]  We all want to stay informed, so visit our website at GCNLive.com and click on the GCN Mall.
[02:28:26.824 --> 02:28:31.246]  Or call 877-996-4327 extension 150.
[02:28:31.667 --> 02:28:32.707]  It's easy and convenient.
[02:28:32.767 --> 02:28:34.288]  Hurry and get your copies today.
[02:28:34.768 --> 02:28:39.410]  Again, visit the GCN Mall at GCNLive.com or simply call 877-996-4327 extension 150.
[02:28:45.774 --> 02:28:50.996]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:28:51.136 --> 02:28:59.239]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:28:59.479 --> 02:29:06.541]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:29:06.721 --> 02:29:08.002]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:29:08.082 --> 02:29:13.987]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:29:14.167 --> 02:29:19.271]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:29:19.371 --> 02:29:28.259]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:29:28.519 --> 02:29:31.821]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:29:33.923 --> 02:29:34.243]  We're good.
[02:29:45.629 --> 02:29:46.630]  It's finally here!
[02:29:46.750 --> 02:29:47.731]  Spring has arrived!
[02:29:47.931 --> 02:29:50.894]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:29:51.114 --> 02:29:54.577]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:29:54.777 --> 02:30:02.944]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[02:30:03.204 --> 02:30:06.927]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[02:30:07.148 --> 02:30:12.152]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[02:30:12.432 --> 02:30:16.939]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[02:30:17.139 --> 02:30:21.205]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[02:30:21.285 --> 02:30:28.435]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn!
[02:30:28.695 --> 02:30:29.275]  Save money.
[02:30:29.495 --> 02:30:30.056]  Eat healthy.
[02:30:30.236 --> 02:30:34.178]  Grow your own delicious, secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.

[02:30:36.098 --> 02:30:37.279]  That's 1-800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com today.
[02:30:48.627 --> 02:30:49.087]  Don't worry.
[02:30:49.608 --> 02:30:51.149]  This show is documented.
[02:30:51.629 --> 02:30:54.091]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:54.111 --> 02:30:59.455]  The truth hurts, folks, but it hurts a lot worse not to know the truth and go through life like an idiot.
[02:31:16.647 --> 02:31:18.809]  We're going to continue with your phone calls.
[02:31:18.829 --> 02:31:21.931]  We've even got a few open lines for the first time today at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:21.951 --> 02:31:22.691]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:24.052 --> 02:31:29.896]  We'll go to Jim in Michigan and others here in just a second.
[02:31:29.916 --> 02:31:34.379]  Just briefly, I hope you'll get Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:31:34.419 --> 02:31:35.360]  It's one of my best films.
[02:31:35.420 --> 02:31:37.001]  It's my longest film.
[02:31:37.021 --> 02:31:39.363]  2 hours 44 minutes long.
[02:31:39.783 --> 02:31:43.066]  Well, the Road to Tyranny DVD is even longer than that, but almost 3 hours.
[02:31:43.086 --> 02:31:43.546]  But the point is,
[02:31:44.513 --> 02:31:47.334]  It's my second longest video, correction there, live on air.
[02:31:48.115 --> 02:31:49.435]  It's really three or four films.
[02:31:49.475 --> 02:31:53.497]  I haven't decided in one who the neocons are, what the new world order is.
[02:31:53.517 --> 02:31:54.797]  That's the first 25 minutes.
[02:31:55.178 --> 02:31:58.619]  Then government-sponsored terrorism, other examples we haven't covered in other films.
[02:31:58.979 --> 02:32:09.003]  Then Homeland Security, Patriot Act 1 and 2, the foreign troops, the militarization of our police, the government-run white slavery rings, gun control, the RFID tracker chips.
[02:32:09.484 --> 02:32:10.264]  It's all in there.
[02:32:11.391 --> 02:32:14.673]  It's all in the police state three total enslavement.
[02:32:15.094 --> 02:32:16.354]  Then I've got Matrix of Evil.
[02:32:16.394 --> 02:32:17.575]  It's one of my newest videos.
[02:32:17.595 --> 02:32:18.396]  The newest video.
[02:32:19.056 --> 02:32:22.939]  And it's got Ron Paul, Cynthia McKinney, Frank Morales, Colonel Roberts, myself.
[02:32:23.479 --> 02:32:31.225]  That's InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order any of the videos I've made.
[02:32:31.425 --> 02:32:31.845]  They're $25.95.
[02:32:31.885 --> 02:32:34.507]  $20 if you get three or more.
[02:32:34.527 --> 02:32:35.407]  So take advantage of that.
[02:32:35.788 --> 02:32:39.210]  Then I've got other videos from $19.95 to $30 a piece.
[02:32:39.230 --> 02:32:40.651]  You know, that cost me a lot to get.
[02:32:41.684 --> 02:32:47.552]  JPFO's Innocence Betrayed video is the best produced Second Amendment film I've seen.
[02:32:48.053 --> 02:32:53.581]  And it comes with three colored booklets about the Second Amendment that are in comic book form to wake people up.
[02:32:53.661 --> 02:32:56.465]  A Grandpa Jack thing, so it's $29.95.
[02:32:59.408 --> 02:33:01.830]  So you need to get that, too, and show it to everybody you know.
[02:33:02.431 --> 02:33:07.455]  But, uh, George Humphrey's new video, 1995, comes with a free 80-plus page color booklet.
[02:33:07.475 --> 02:33:12.380]  9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati, and that's the same name of the video.
[02:33:12.700 --> 02:33:14.262]  Get a second copy of that for $14.95.
[02:33:15.162 --> 02:33:18.966]  And three of the color booklets, so that's three color booklets, two videos for $34.95.
[02:33:19.326 --> 02:33:20.988]  A lot of different specials.
[02:33:21.528 --> 02:33:23.469]  And these are great films you need to have.
[02:33:23.489 --> 02:33:33.313]  Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order via the Safe Secure Shopping Cart or 888-253-3139.
[02:33:34.353 --> 02:33:36.254]  Let's go ahead and go to Jim in Michigan.
[02:33:36.274 --> 02:33:36.914]  Jim, welcome.
[02:33:37.954 --> 02:33:38.515]  You today.
[02:33:38.835 --> 02:33:39.295]  Hello, sir.
[02:33:39.955 --> 02:33:47.058]  Listen, I just faxed you about 20 minutes ago a copy of the State of Michigan Immunization Waiver Form.
[02:33:47.648 --> 02:33:47.928]  Yes.
[02:33:48.469 --> 02:33:53.992]  And I filled one of those out quite a few years ago for my daughter when she went to a Christian school up here.
[02:33:54.012 --> 02:34:05.180]  And I just picked up a new one today and I noticed there is an addition here in the wording of the Michigan waiver form that really set up some red flags.
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.801]  The addition is, if I may read it, it's very short.
[02:34:09.901 --> 02:34:11.241]  Yeah, read the whole thing if you want.
[02:34:11.762 --> 02:34:25.506]  Well, the whole thing is very long, but this is the thing that I think the people, I mean, especially in Michigan, it says, by signing this waiver, you acknowledge that you are placing your child and others at risk of serious illness.
[02:34:25.827 --> 02:34:27.907]  So they've added that as a liability clause.
[02:34:27.927 --> 02:34:29.788]  That's not in Texas and many other states.
[02:34:30.108 --> 02:34:32.369]  You should have that repealed or just refuse to sign it.
[02:34:32.869 --> 02:34:33.509]  That's amazing.
[02:34:33.549 --> 02:34:35.750]  So they're trying to make you sign a confession of guilt.
[02:34:36.488 --> 02:34:43.553]  Yeah, and the bad thing is they say that you're placing your child and others at risk, but the others have been vaccinated.
[02:34:43.853 --> 02:34:44.733]  How can they be at risk?
[02:34:44.773 --> 02:34:53.959]  But basically what they're doing is to have you sign saying that you knowingly are, you know, it's like child cruelty, not to immunize your children.
[02:34:54.019 --> 02:34:56.120]  And that's what they do, then they come after you.
[02:34:56.661 --> 02:35:02.525]  So I would think that any parent, I have my sister who's a president of the Michigan
[02:35:03.955 --> 02:35:22.426]  Autism and Autoimmunity Society, who works with Dr. Mark Guyer very closely, and she's also been in Lansing testifying before committees, but I'm going to give this to her and see whether or not you can admit this from the waiver, but as it reads right now, I'd be... Yeah, I would cross it out.
[02:35:22.486 --> 02:35:23.587]  I mean, I wouldn't even sign it.
[02:35:23.627 --> 02:35:26.689]  They can't make you put stuff in your body, these deadly poisons.
[02:35:26.729 --> 02:35:29.731]  I mean, and if they come after you, you sue the daylights out of them, criminals.
[02:35:30.379 --> 02:35:30.859]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:35:31.320 --> 02:35:31.860]  Anything else?
[02:35:32.100 --> 02:35:32.721]  No, that's it, sir.
[02:35:33.061 --> 02:35:33.461]  All right.
[02:35:33.521 --> 02:35:35.643]  Well, I've looked at a bunch of other states and they don't have that.
[02:35:35.663 --> 02:35:38.806]  In fact, the waivers are getting stronger.
[02:35:39.626 --> 02:35:42.628]  And they're not just religious, they're conscientious and medical.
[02:35:43.089 --> 02:35:44.630]  But, wow, they added that.
[02:35:44.890 --> 02:35:48.053]  I know the only area that's trying to pass a law to make you do it is D.C.
[02:35:48.093 --> 02:35:50.174]  And last time I checked, they hadn't passed it.
[02:35:50.515 --> 02:35:57.620]  But they're all over the news saying you've got to lie in there, rear ends off, and they're not going to be able to cover up what they've done, folks.
[02:35:57.660 --> 02:35:59.962]  People are waking up very, very fast.
[02:36:00.529 --> 02:36:04.370]  Stephanie, I'm going to go to calls here in a few minutes, and I didn't get the call list.
[02:36:04.390 --> 02:36:05.010]  Who's up next?
[02:36:06.210 --> 02:36:07.691]  Okay, we'll go to him in just a few minutes.
[02:36:07.731 --> 02:36:14.132]  Let me get into some of this news, though, because this is really important.
[02:36:14.632 --> 02:36:17.953]  It says, Georgia President warns of war with Russia.
[02:36:18.853 --> 02:36:21.573]  AFP, that's the National French AP, basically.
[02:36:22.054 --> 02:36:24.094]  Georgian President Mikhail
[02:36:26.213 --> 02:36:34.820]  Shakavali, I'll pronounce that right, has reportedly said war with Russia is close and it is necessary to prepare the people of Georgia for such an eventuality.
[02:36:35.120 --> 02:36:36.742]  We are very close to war with Russia.
[02:36:36.762 --> 02:36:40.164]  The population must be prepared, he told the Liberation newspaper.
[02:36:40.305 --> 02:36:40.665]  Wow!
[02:36:41.065 --> 02:36:51.574]  Announcing military aid from Russia to rebels in Georgia's breakaway region of South Ozeti, the President stressed that he had no intention of provoking a war.
[02:36:52.213 --> 02:36:58.558]  He also called for an international conference to discuss the status of South Ossetia.
[02:36:58.638 --> 02:37:03.422]  Russia said it is opposed to this, but I think its position is evolving, he said.
[02:37:03.482 --> 02:37:12.690]  Georgia pulled troops back from the separatist pro-Moscow region last week after an unprecedented show of force that infuriated Russia and worried Washington.
[02:37:12.710 --> 02:37:13.871]  Yeah, Georgia's got nukes.
[02:37:14.571 --> 02:37:20.056]  And the South area falls within Georgia's borders, but is inhabited mainly by ethnic Ossenates.
[02:37:21.817 --> 02:37:23.859]  That's another pronunciation of it.
[02:37:24.319 --> 02:37:26.301]  By the way, we have troops in Georgia.
[02:37:26.341 --> 02:37:28.082]  Man, this is getting really weird.
[02:37:38.485 --> 02:37:42.246]  Al-Sadr's militiaman to leave the Najaf Mosque.
[02:37:42.346 --> 02:37:47.048]  Al-Sadr aide said Tuesday that the cleric is ready to negotiate a ceasefire and end the standoff.
[02:37:47.088 --> 02:37:52.109]  Yeah, they're telling him to leave but have snipers and tanks all around the building and they've blown up about half of it.
[02:37:53.310 --> 02:37:58.651]  And the Christian Science Monitor and two other major news entities got in there.
[02:37:58.711 --> 02:38:00.352]  There's no weapons, no nothing.
[02:38:02.429 --> 02:38:09.212]  Folks, this is like 1984, where a person is our ally one day and the next day they're our enemy.
[02:38:09.773 --> 02:38:11.453]  Al Sadr was anti-Saddam.
[02:38:11.994 --> 02:38:15.435]  He was with the forces that attacked Saddam back in 1991 under our orders.
[02:38:15.995 --> 02:38:18.817]  Then they came in and put Ba'athists and Sunnis into power.
[02:38:19.237 --> 02:38:22.218]  He got mad, started complaining in his newspapers.
[02:38:22.258 --> 02:38:24.539]  They raided it, arrested a bunch of people.
[02:38:24.839 --> 02:38:26.020]  He started criticizing.
[02:38:26.644 --> 02:38:35.788]  Then they go into Mosque and attack and try to get him, and then the Muslims get angry, the Shiites do, our supposed buddies, who were there with open arms when we came in, and now they're the big threat!
[02:38:35.808 --> 02:38:39.070]  Now they're the big bad guys, because they don't want Saddam's people back in!
[02:38:39.710 --> 02:38:44.052]  And then Brett Hume, I've got the quote, he said, we should just go in there and kill al-Sadr!
[02:38:44.312 --> 02:38:45.072]  Just kill him!
[02:38:46.293 --> 02:38:47.453]  This is fair and balanced?
[02:38:47.733 --> 02:38:48.914]  Let's just go kill him!
[02:38:50.315 --> 02:38:53.156]  And folks, it's like hitting a beehive with a baseball bat!
[02:38:55.023 --> 02:39:03.809]  There's no reason, other than the Pentagon's own report, P-2-O-G, six billion dollar program, says they want to infuriate the Muslims, get them to attack us.
[02:39:05.511 --> 02:39:06.111]  Now which is it?
[02:39:06.151 --> 02:39:08.453]  Is Saddam bad, or are the Chiites bad?
[02:39:11.375 --> 02:39:16.558]  And boy, they just love to demonize this guy, and he's the guy who keeps getting our reporters released.
[02:39:16.599 --> 02:39:18.500]  His people haven't grabbed him, but he gets them released.
[02:39:19.461 --> 02:39:22.364]  He's the guy trying to keep the media there so they can see what's really happening.
[02:39:22.384 --> 02:39:26.427]  And our government went into nausea last week and said, get out media, we're going to kill you!
[02:39:27.768 --> 02:39:29.349]  We're going to kill you if you don't leave!
[02:39:29.529 --> 02:39:31.491]  And then had our troops machine gun the hotel.
[02:39:32.071 --> 02:39:35.814]  I mean, imagine if Al Sauter was machine gunning our hotels.
[02:39:37.856 --> 02:39:38.817]  Come on, folks.
[02:39:40.058 --> 02:39:41.999]  And then next week, I guess Al Sauter will be good.
[02:39:42.059 --> 02:39:43.641]  It's like Qaddafi now they say is good.
[02:39:44.021 --> 02:39:46.042]  I mean, Al Sauter's an angel compared to Qaddafi.
[02:39:46.283 --> 02:39:47.804]  Al Sauter's never blown anything up.
[02:39:48.860 --> 02:39:50.782]  But oh, he's bad, but Gaddafi's good.
[02:39:50.843 --> 02:39:52.184]  I mean, give me a break!
[02:39:58.051 --> 02:40:02.056]  Let's go to this other news article, and then we'll go to the folks that are holding.
[02:40:02.337 --> 02:40:04.559]  And again, we'll take more of your calls here in just a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:40:08.656 --> 02:40:16.192]  On InfoWars.com we have the article about the State Guard to be in martial law type maneuvers, oppressing the population, riot control.
[02:40:16.753 --> 02:40:18.516]  All over the country these are being formed.
[02:40:19.310 --> 02:40:23.873]  And this is out of WISH-TV News 8 out of Indianapolis, Indiana.
[02:40:24.313 --> 02:40:27.075]  National Guard unit gets new mission on a home front.
[02:40:27.095 --> 02:40:31.917]  An Indiana National Guard unit that just returned from Iraq will soon have a new mission.
[02:40:32.478 --> 02:40:36.800]  The 293rd Infantry from Northern Indiana will be the first.
[02:40:36.840 --> 02:40:39.142]  This is regular guard, not state guard.
[02:40:39.462 --> 02:40:42.404]  Will be the first unit trained to respond to disturbances.
[02:40:43.304 --> 02:40:48.287]  See, disturbances in the state, and I read the Texas document, roundups, mass arrests,
[02:40:48.996 --> 02:40:49.956]  Putting people in camps.
[02:40:50.317 --> 02:40:54.478]  The unit is expected to begin one week of anti-terrorism training within the next 30 days.
[02:40:55.159 --> 02:40:58.580]  24 Hour News 8 was there at Camp Atterbury.
[02:40:59.100 --> 02:41:05.223]  By the way, in my book, Descent into Tyranny, and on my website, we have the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[02:41:05.503 --> 02:41:07.404]  Just type it into the search engine and it will pop up.
[02:41:09.104 --> 02:41:15.807]  Go to searchinfowars.com and just type in, uh, Civilian Internment Camp Army Document and it will pop up.
[02:41:16.957 --> 02:41:19.939]  A 24 Hour News 8 was there at Camp Atterbury.
[02:41:19.959 --> 02:41:25.824]  That's one of the ones that since the early 80's has had prisoners, federal and state prisoners, slaving on it.
[02:41:26.505 --> 02:41:28.086]  And they didn't declassify it until 1997.
[02:41:28.446 --> 02:41:30.648]  This is an official Army document.
[02:41:30.828 --> 02:41:32.409]  We have a link to the Army's website.
[02:41:32.429 --> 02:41:33.270]  They don't even take it down.
[02:41:35.774 --> 02:41:39.979]  The Army spokeswoman on the page is Yvonne Wildfire.
[02:41:39.999 --> 02:41:42.081]  I remember her name and I even called her up.
[02:41:42.101 --> 02:41:44.404]  She wouldn't come on, but contact info.
[02:41:44.804 --> 02:41:47.167]  So it's Camp Atterbury, which is a camp with people at it.
[02:41:47.767 --> 02:41:49.549]  Which was, for a decade, was secret.
[02:41:51.054 --> 02:41:52.195]  Well, we don't have camps, though.
[02:41:52.215 --> 02:41:58.379]  24-Hour News 8 was there at Camp Atterbury when they trained for their mission into Iraq, which ended in October.
[02:41:58.819 --> 02:42:06.223]  The 650-member battalion, which is based in Fort Wayne area, will respond to threats to critical infrastructure, and you can go watch the video clip of this as well.
[02:42:08.825 --> 02:42:14.488]  And this is all over the country, all over the world, the western world, this is happening.
[02:42:15.089 --> 02:42:16.109]  Who's up first, Stephanie?
[02:42:17.210 --> 02:42:17.730]  Zig.
[02:42:18.551 --> 02:42:19.571]  Zig in Colorado.
[02:42:19.611 --> 02:42:20.332]  Go ahead, Zig.
[02:42:21.517 --> 02:42:22.398]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:42:23.579 --> 02:42:31.066]  Just calling to let you know we just finished harassing the Million Moms and their big pink rig in Denver.
[02:42:31.266 --> 02:42:32.808]  What was it, 100 bureaucrats?
[02:42:33.929 --> 02:42:39.374]  No, they had about 26 of their people, about 10 media.
[02:42:39.414 --> 02:42:41.636]  We only managed to get 3 people out because the Million Moms
[02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:44.001]  ...are hiding these days.
[02:42:44.021 --> 02:42:44.761]  They don't like to know who we are.
[02:42:44.781 --> 02:42:45.481]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:42:45.521 --> 02:42:52.045]  They keep calling it the Million Mob, but we went out and shut down basically two of their meetings a few years ago, bullhorning them at the Capitol.
[02:42:52.065 --> 02:42:59.068]  They would physically attack us, and the police finally arrested one for jumping her car over a curb and then laying on the horn, threatening to kill me.
[02:42:59.848 --> 02:43:02.770]  But the police actually arrested her, but they would hit me with signs.
[02:43:02.790 --> 02:43:04.430]  The police would do nothing, but at least they did that.
[02:43:05.371 --> 02:43:09.653]  But just to make a long story short, I call it the 100 Bureaucrat March.
[02:43:10.528 --> 02:43:14.770]  Of the 100 people that showed up to both marches, over half of them were public officials.
[02:43:16.150 --> 02:43:18.651]  So you had a 23-bureaucrat march.
[02:43:18.711 --> 02:43:23.033]  Why don't you call yourselves the 3-billion since there were only three of you?
[02:43:23.573 --> 02:43:24.353]  Well, there you go.
[02:43:24.393 --> 02:43:29.655]  We're actually the founding TRT in the world, the Attorney Response Team.
[02:43:30.507 --> 02:43:35.812]  You guys have had hundreds and hundreds of people out but I guess they're hiding so you got five minutes notice and got three people out.
[02:43:36.252 --> 02:43:42.057]  We actually had just under two hours notice and we managed to get three people out.
[02:43:42.097 --> 02:43:52.886]  They've been planning this crap for the better part of eight or nine months and they managed to get 27 people including Diana DeGette who had to be escorted away by her armed guard.
[02:43:52.966 --> 02:43:57.630]  We had the police chief of the city of Denver who refused to talk to us in front of a camera.
[02:43:58.793 --> 02:44:05.277]  Uh, we had a whole bunch of just slimy, nasty people, including one million moms who admitted that she owns two pistols.
[02:44:06.678 --> 02:44:11.181]  But for some reason she doesn't think, uh, she doesn't seem to think that you need an ugly gun.
[02:44:11.201 --> 02:44:13.782]  Well, why don't we call them, why don't we call them million moms?
[02:44:13.842 --> 02:44:16.924]  I mean, you have the 23 bureaucrat march.
[02:44:17.464 --> 02:44:19.506]  Absolutely, that's exactly what these people are.
[02:44:19.526 --> 02:44:26.530]  Uh, we'll be, we'll be trying to post some signs a little later and do a write-up on it, uh, up on a website somewhere, so just look for it.
[02:44:27.428 --> 02:44:29.869]  They are going, of course, to New York and to Washington, D.C.
[02:44:29.929 --> 02:44:32.990]  They're going to be in New York the same time you are for the convention.
[02:44:34.350 --> 02:44:37.071]  Well, I'll be there protesting them.
[02:44:37.611 --> 02:44:40.972]  Alright, and all you have to do is make friends with the news media.
[02:44:41.092 --> 02:44:50.435]  Their trick is to come into town and announce to the news media, and they don't get parade permits, they just announce that this is a press conference.
[02:44:50.455 --> 02:44:53.856]  And put it on a piece of church property or next to a school.
[02:44:54.819 --> 02:44:58.502]  Uh, so that they can't, uh... They're a disgusting organization.
[02:44:59.282 --> 02:45:03.825]  Oh, they're a wonderful group of cowardly, ridiculous, silly women.
[02:45:04.746 --> 02:45:07.848]  And, uh, it's really too bad, uh, but they have lots of money.
[02:45:08.248 --> 02:45:08.909]  We have to give them that.
[02:45:08.949 --> 02:45:10.570]  The Pell Campaign finances them well.
[02:45:11.350 --> 02:45:21.357]  Well, there's nothing wrong with having money, but I have to tell you that at the parking lots where these people are, they literally all drive the $100,000 Mercedes fully loaded Jaguars.
[02:45:24.580 --> 02:45:25.000]  Oh, they were.
[02:45:25.821 --> 02:45:32.945]  In this case, Alex, they decided to put it on over at a Catholic church in a black neighborhood.
[02:45:33.805 --> 02:45:38.227]  So they would get the black community in on the thing.
[02:45:38.828 --> 02:45:44.211]  And it's really unfortunate to see how many good liberal Democrats there are in the black community.
[02:45:44.731 --> 02:45:48.253]  People who think, as I pointed out to them loud and long,
[02:45:48.737 --> 02:45:52.718]  That police chief and his men have no responsibility to you as a citizen.
[02:45:52.818 --> 02:45:56.619]  Yeah, they routinely blow innocent people away, arrest people who have guns legally.
[02:45:56.639 --> 02:45:58.780]  I mean, Denver is just out of control.
[02:45:59.400 --> 02:46:01.200]  And now, I do confirm it.
[02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:03.761]  Now they're shutting down Denver's access television.
[02:46:04.081 --> 02:46:05.361]  No free speech for the people.
[02:46:05.601 --> 02:46:07.802]  We're going to abuse you and you're going to have no recourse.
[02:46:08.462 --> 02:46:09.602]  We're going to do it in the dark.
[02:46:10.203 --> 02:46:13.243]  And they see the gas after the cameras have turned off.
[02:46:13.624 --> 02:46:15.224]  I explained to the ladies there.
[02:46:15.737 --> 02:46:20.513]  And if they weren't very, very careful, they might wind up being a slave like some of my ancestors in Eastern Europe were.
[02:46:21.591 --> 02:46:25.312]  And, uh, they were absolutely appalled that I would dare to use the word slave.
[02:46:25.732 --> 02:46:26.952]  You know, I did that the other night.
[02:46:27.032 --> 02:46:32.874]  There was a black board member at one of the Axis TV meetings and they were trying to kick us out and shut us down and do all this.
[02:46:33.334 --> 02:46:38.335]  And I said, sir, I say this to everybody, black, white, I said it to Vicente Fox, we're not your slaves.
[02:46:38.695 --> 02:46:40.396]  I said, hey, stop trying to take our freedoms.
[02:46:40.856 --> 02:46:42.296]  And he said, I'm not doing that.
[02:46:42.316 --> 02:46:43.997]  And I said, yes, we're not your slaves.
[02:46:44.037 --> 02:46:45.257]  And he just freaked out.
[02:46:45.277 --> 02:46:46.377]  He just, oh, oh.
[02:46:46.677 --> 02:46:48.878]  And I'm like, hey man, we're not your slaves.
[02:46:49.879 --> 02:46:57.327]  Well, this is a word that they think only they can use, and they can only use to try to shame you and to guilt you.
[02:46:57.387 --> 02:46:59.069]  And I'm sorry, that's not what this is about.
[02:46:59.409 --> 02:47:05.355]  This is about my freedom and my responsibility to defend my life and my community.
[02:47:05.375 --> 02:47:06.176]  Well, that's the point.
[02:47:06.236 --> 02:47:09.039]  Most people from Europe, our ancestors were slaves.
[02:47:09.580 --> 02:47:10.781]  Slavery is the norm.
[02:47:11.508 --> 02:47:13.989]  And they were slaves in the 20th century.
[02:47:14.049 --> 02:47:17.589]  Hey, the Germans weren't freed until the late 1860s.
[02:47:18.090 --> 02:47:21.410]  The Germans literally were slaves.
[02:47:21.470 --> 02:47:27.912]  I mean, towns, the local town nobility would literally load up all the young men and sell them for wars.
[02:47:30.373 --> 02:47:33.013]  But again, that's not in the history books.
[02:47:33.593 --> 02:47:36.254]  Well, it's the way that the world really has been.
[02:47:36.855 --> 02:47:40.436]  And it's the way that the world will be again if people don't wake up.
[02:47:40.536 --> 02:47:42.456]  And I'm... I despair that they will.
[02:47:42.576 --> 02:47:50.198]  I'm... I'm not sure that we're just not beating our heads against the wall and the masses will... will, uh, get... Sir!
[02:47:50.558 --> 02:47:50.918]  Sir!
[02:47:51.018 --> 02:47:51.598]  ...on to the train.
[02:47:51.838 --> 02:47:55.399]  You know, it's like... it's like holding your hand over a water hose on high.
[02:47:55.459 --> 02:47:57.459]  We're blocking back most of the water.
[02:47:58.539 --> 02:48:01.820]  Or, you know, we put a kink in the hose and there's still a lot of water coming out.
[02:48:01.840 --> 02:48:03.080]  You think, man, it's a lot of tyranny.
[02:48:03.440 --> 02:48:06.341]  If you let go, that thing is gonna just gush.
[02:48:07.023 --> 02:48:08.266]  I'll tell ya, I'm not letting go.
[02:48:08.607 --> 02:48:09.509]  There is no other way.
[02:48:09.550 --> 02:48:10.752]  There's freedom or death.
[02:48:11.554 --> 02:48:12.196]  Absolutely.
[02:48:12.757 --> 02:48:13.980]  I appreciate your call.

[02:50:44.122 --> 02:50:48.465]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:50:48.645 --> 02:50:53.069]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.

[02:51:46.501 --> 02:51:51.643]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:52.324 --> 02:51:54.685]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:51:57.146 --> 02:52:04.190]  I've got an article here from the San Francisco Chronicle and it's biosafety network.
[02:52:04.250 --> 02:52:09.533]  The federal government is building a network of maximum security or level 4 biosafety laboratories.
[02:52:10.225 --> 02:52:11.286]  Talk about doublespeak.
[02:52:11.666 --> 02:52:18.569]  It has approved plans for labs in Boston, Galveston, Texas, it's already there, which would join six other Level 4 labs.
[02:52:19.229 --> 02:52:21.611]  There will be a total of three dozen.
[02:52:23.071 --> 02:52:25.793]  And notice how they call it bio-safety laboratories.
[02:52:26.493 --> 02:52:34.277]  Folks, these are bio-weapons plants, they admit it, to be built in major cities all over the country, on major fault lines, you name it.
[02:52:35.111 --> 02:52:40.472]  And they claim they've accidentally released deadly bio-weapons before from level 4 bio-weapons labs in England!
[02:52:41.212 --> 02:52:45.573]  Oh, and there's gonna be another accident, God forbid, but I mean, it's just disgusting!
[02:52:47.914 --> 02:52:48.014]  Oh!
[02:52:49.614 --> 02:52:53.675]  PUSH just got like, what, 6 billion dollars funding for this bio-shield program?
[02:52:56.195 --> 02:52:59.996]  We're not talking about that, we're talking about Lacey Peterson and Michael Jackson's nose,
[02:53:00.672 --> 02:53:09.438]  You know, his plastic surgery in the Olympics, Iraqi soccer team, you know, says, we don't want Bush to come to our game and use us for propaganda, and, oh, they're so evil!
[02:53:10.259 --> 02:53:15.042]  We've given them freedom, yes, we've given them total tyranny and sprinkled the earth with depleted uranium.
[02:53:15.062 --> 02:53:19.245]  I mean, it's just a total distraction, all of this is a total...
[02:53:21.099 --> 02:53:21.640]  Distraction.
[02:53:21.960 --> 02:53:34.465]  CNN is admitting that the three companies that certify the nation's voting technologies operate in secrecy and refuse to discuss flaws in the ATM-like machines to be used by nearly one in three voters in November.
[02:53:35.426 --> 02:53:37.127]  Yeah, 32% of the country has these.
[02:53:37.427 --> 02:53:39.688]  They aren't flaws, CNN, and you know that.
[02:53:40.128 --> 02:53:42.469]  This is, of course, CNN is carrying an AP article.
[02:53:42.489 --> 02:53:44.630]  I wouldn't expect real journalism from CNN.
[02:53:45.070 --> 02:53:46.571]  Of course, it's a substory AP.
[02:53:47.532 --> 02:53:56.096]  Despite concerns over whether the so-called touchscreen machines can be trusted, the testing companies won't say publicly if they have encountered shoddy worksmanship.
[02:53:56.196 --> 02:53:57.736]  It's designed for fraud.
[02:53:57.997 --> 02:53:59.437]  Their own engineers have gone public.
[02:53:59.877 --> 02:54:00.918]  Here's another one, AP.
[02:54:01.418 --> 02:54:04.960]  E-voting machine certification criticized.
[02:54:05.020 --> 02:54:06.760]  Another article about that.
[02:54:07.301 --> 02:54:09.421]  Up to 50 million Americans expected to use them.
[02:54:10.682 --> 02:54:12.243]  Folks, it's run by the CIA.
[02:54:12.283 --> 02:54:12.903]  We've proven that.
[02:54:13.890 --> 02:54:17.874]  Also, Patrick J. Buchanan says, America's next war, Iran!
[02:54:17.894 --> 02:54:22.278]  And he says, with North Korea, the train has left the station.
[02:54:22.658 --> 02:54:25.161]  North Korea can now produce nuclear weapons, and has them.
[02:54:26.302 --> 02:54:35.050]  And for nations like North Korea, and men like Kim Jong-il, do not build costly and complex ballistic missile systems simply to throw conventional explosives across the ocean!
[02:54:36.051 --> 02:54:38.193]  And he says that under this doctrine, Iran
[02:54:39.689 --> 02:54:49.677]  Iraq was invaded, Saddam overthrown, and his army disbanded, though we have yet to find any of the world's most destructive weapons, to use one of Bush's quotes.
[02:54:50.157 --> 02:54:55.141]  And Buchanan just goes on to point out that Saddam isn't a threat, Iraq wasn't a threat, Iran's not a threat.
[02:54:55.502 --> 02:54:57.323]  Why are we getting ready to go into Iran?
[02:54:58.684 --> 02:54:59.304]  It's real simple.
[02:55:00.445 --> 02:55:08.932]  And I've got a whole stack of articles about thumb scanners going in grocery stores, going in schools, red light cameras going up federally all over the country to also look for crime,
[02:55:09.713 --> 02:55:14.376]  And how Big Brothers Big Business and CNET are reporting about human chips more than skin deep.
[02:55:15.277 --> 02:55:24.224]  How great it is and how all over the news they say that we all need to have microchips and if we all had chips it would cause just basically milk and honey.
[02:55:25.284 --> 02:55:26.825]  Just link the article about that.
[02:55:27.286 --> 02:55:34.151]  Planned Parenthood is more news out selling a line of clothing bragging that I have abortions.
[02:55:39.804 --> 02:55:42.826]  Making fun of pregnant women and just pure evil.
[02:55:43.426 --> 02:55:44.767]  I mean, it's not just like they love death.
[02:55:44.787 --> 02:55:46.307]  They love to promote it and say it's great.
[02:55:46.728 --> 02:55:54.532]  Fourteen of the search dogs have died of cancer in the last two and a half years that worked the site of the World Trade Centers.
[02:55:55.132 --> 02:56:01.095]  All that toxic stuff they breathe and the EPA admits it.
[02:56:01.215 --> 02:56:02.256]  Bush said covered it up.
[02:56:03.296 --> 02:56:08.119]  I want to give those fire... By the way, Bush blocked the firefighters and policemen getting medical care and getting that paid for.
[02:56:09.013 --> 02:56:10.554]  But again, that's how you support the police.
[02:56:10.574 --> 02:56:11.834]  You don't give them treatment.
[02:56:12.274 --> 02:56:15.295]  Well, I disagree with that, but hey, I'm evil, I guess.
[02:56:15.475 --> 02:56:18.416]  All right, back tonight, 9 to midnight, Central Standard Time.
[02:56:18.777 --> 02:56:21.298]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2, and I'll be in New York next week.
[02:56:21.318 --> 02:56:25.319]  We'll have Phil in host, but I'll be calling in with live reports from on the street.
[02:56:26.059 --> 02:56:27.680]  So stay with us for the rest of the week.
[02:56:27.720 --> 02:56:31.321]  It's only Tuesday, and as I said, we'll be back tonight and back on Wednesday.
[02:56:31.361 --> 02:56:32.202]  God bless you all.
