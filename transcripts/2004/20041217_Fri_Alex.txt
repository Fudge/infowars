[00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:05.516]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.176 --> 00:00:07.237]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.958 --> 00:00:09.059]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:10.540]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:12.202]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.862 --> 00:00:16.525]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:21.110]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.226 --> 00:00:25.487]  Yes, my friends, we are live.
[00:00:25.547 --> 00:00:30.248]  It is Friday, the 17th day of December, 2004.
[00:00:31.228 --> 00:00:38.150]  We'll be here for the next two hours and 59 minutes, 25 seconds to be precise.
[00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:50.053]  The websites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowars.net, ArnoldExposed.com, JonesReport.com, and VirginUtah.com.
[00:00:51.627 --> 00:00:52.869]  Why are there so many sites?
[00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:57.434]  Because there's so many great webmasters, and so much information, and so many servers.
[00:00:58.255 --> 00:01:01.839]  It's called redundancy, which is a good thing when you're in a war.
[00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:12.311]  You want to have more ships, more airplanes, more tanks, more soldiers engaging the enemy, and this is an info war.
[00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:15.857]  A lot of the same information is on the sites.
[00:01:15.897 --> 00:01:18.239]  A lot of different information is on the sites.
[00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:19.760]  So spread the word and check them out today.
[00:01:20.321 --> 00:01:21.922]  Big show lined up for you.
[00:01:23.043 --> 00:01:23.983]  Huge broadcast.
[00:01:25.465 --> 00:01:26.906]  A lot of horrible things have happened.
[00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:33.671]  Lord Bush will be signing the USA Patriot Act and the Homeland Security National ID card legislation today.
[00:01:35.058 --> 00:01:39.522]  And so USA Today came out and said, yep, it's your national ID card.
[00:01:39.602 --> 00:01:42.164]  Yeah, because now they need to announce it to us.
[00:01:42.204 --> 00:01:44.826]  They wouldn't tell you about it in the months that we were battling it.
[00:01:47.147 --> 00:01:56.555]  Because they know it's wildly unpopular, but now they're coming out in all these big papers, that's just one of them, and going, surprise, surprise, Gomer, guess what's in there?
[00:01:56.815 --> 00:01:58.216]  Oh, but it's for your safety.
[00:02:01.582 --> 00:02:02.723]  So, we'll be going over that.
[00:02:03.364 --> 00:02:07.707]  A horrible helter-skelter style murder of an eight-month pregnant woman.
[00:02:08.187 --> 00:02:10.329]  Some demonic creature.
[00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.933]  Some hellspawn cut the baby out of her.
[00:02:14.973 --> 00:02:17.135]  And there's big APBs out on it.
[00:02:17.155 --> 00:02:18.015]  And I hope they catch them.
[00:02:18.035 --> 00:02:18.896]  I hope they save the baby.
[00:02:18.916 --> 00:02:20.237]  I hope the baby's alive.
[00:02:21.178 --> 00:02:24.400]  But I have my reason for wanting to cover this article.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.501]  And we'll be covering that.
[00:02:27.303 --> 00:02:29.945]  By the way, I got a call yesterday afternoon.
[00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:42.335]  By a local radio producer that I'm friends with, and she's friends with one of the stars of, he was in some X-Files episodes, but he was a star in The Lone Gunman.
[00:02:42.775 --> 00:02:43.815]  He's Dean Haglund.
[00:02:44.435 --> 00:02:45.316]  He played the hacker.
[00:02:46.276 --> 00:02:47.216]  The computer expert.
[00:02:47.717 --> 00:02:49.437]  She says, hey, he wants to drop by your house.
[00:02:49.477 --> 00:02:50.698]  He's making a documentary.
[00:02:51.898 --> 00:02:52.998]  And so I said, sure.
[00:02:53.018 --> 00:02:54.919]  A few hours later, knock, knock.
[00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:56.600]  There is Dean Haglund.
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.800]  Remember, he was in
[00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:05.992]  One of many episodes, but where the government tries to fly a hijacked jet in the World Trade Center to get martial law to invade foreign countries?
[00:03:08.653 --> 00:03:10.713]  Well, he agreed with me last night that he thinks the U.S.
[00:03:10.733 --> 00:03:12.234]  government did carry out 9-11.
[00:03:13.915 --> 00:03:15.655]  And he has his reasons for why.
[00:03:16.495 --> 00:03:23.178]  In 2000, they wrote the script for it, filmed it in early 2001, and broadcast it months before September 11th.
[00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.500]  And so, Dean Hagelin will be joining us.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:47.424]  Some interesting revelations, including the CIA in Hollywood approaching people like Chris Carter, the developer, the founder, the brain child of the individual who came up with the X-Files.
[00:03:48.904 --> 00:03:51.304]  So, my life just gets weirder and weirder.
[00:03:51.344 --> 00:03:53.125]  I've got X-Files stars...
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.001]  You know, showing up at my house now.
[00:03:58.223 --> 00:04:00.204]  Life is really an adventure, isn't it?
[00:04:00.805 --> 00:04:04.568]  So, that is coming up in 25 minutes.
[00:04:04.908 --> 00:04:08.291]  It'll be 26 minutes to be a little more precise.
[00:04:09.051 --> 00:04:13.234]  But we'll cover a lot of the news before we get to Mr. Hagelin.
[00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:26.353]  And we have links to his website and links to the Lone Gunman episode, clips of it that we've been talking about, up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:04:27.154 --> 00:04:30.635]  So that is coming up a little bit later in this first hour.
[00:04:30.675 --> 00:04:39.337]  And then later, we've got some of the lawyers that are going after the government, trying to stop Alberto I Love Torture Gonzalez from being the new Attorney General.
[00:04:40.638 --> 00:04:41.438]  Mayor General...
[00:04:42.285 --> 00:04:46.871]  So we'll be going over that in the second hour.
[00:04:47.552 --> 00:04:56.965]  So, ultra-massive Friday special edition of this broadcast that I like to call Real Talk Radio.
[00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:01.940]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.181]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:05.301 --> 00:05:09.203]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:09.263 --> 00:05:13.484]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:05:13.845 --> 00:05:17.606]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:17.686 --> 00:05:19.547]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.147 --> 00:05:23.028]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[00:05:23.088 --> 00:05:27.809]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:31.010]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.031]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:40.653]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:41.193 --> 00:05:43.034]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[00:06:01.317 --> 00:06:02.358]  The war on terrorism.
[00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:05.483]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:05.743 --> 00:06:09.909]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:10.329 --> 00:06:11.170]  So what do you do?
[00:06:11.491 --> 00:06:16.057]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:16.537 --> 00:06:18.658]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:33.848]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:33.888 --> 00:06:40.952]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:41.292 --> 00:06:45.696]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:06:46.136 --> 00:06:47.917]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:47.937 --> 00:06:48.138]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:07:01.664 --> 00:07:02.004]  Thank you.
[00:07:19.441 --> 00:07:25.544]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:25.684 --> 00:07:26.944]  There are no side effects.
[00:07:27.264 --> 00:07:30.205]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:31.266]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:32.386]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:07:32.686 --> 00:07:39.929]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.631]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:07:44.031 --> 00:07:44.331]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.229 --> 00:08:07.290]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.090]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:09.751 --> 00:08:10.611]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.331 --> 00:08:12.212]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.232 --> 00:08:16.773]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.074 --> 00:08:21.215]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:21.235 --> 00:08:30.359]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central.
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.161]  Back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:08:36.815 --> 00:08:37.876]  That's 10 p.m.
[00:08:37.956 --> 00:08:38.796]  to 1 a.m.
[00:08:38.896 --> 00:08:42.098]  Eastern at night, 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[00:08:42.198 --> 00:08:43.459]  Eastern during the day.
[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:54.005]  Simulcasting, or quadruple casting, I should say, on satellite, the internet, shortwave, and your AM and FM stations.
[00:08:56.847 --> 00:09:00.309]  Coroner, Gary Webb's death confirmed as suicide.
[00:09:02.882 --> 00:09:08.584]  And this came out in the Associated Press and several other publications yesterday.
[00:09:08.604 --> 00:09:16.907]  Now, the media first reported that he'd been shot multiple times in the head with a shotgun.
[00:09:16.927 --> 00:09:18.007]  Then they corrected that.
[00:09:18.027 --> 00:09:19.068]  The coroner says no.
[00:09:20.148 --> 00:09:21.729]  Twice in the head with a .38 Special.
[00:09:25.575 --> 00:09:30.018]  And the coroner is actually quoted by several newspapers as saying people find it hard to believe.
[00:09:30.398 --> 00:09:35.761]  We've had hundreds of calls to the coroner's office here in Sacramento knowing, is it multiple gunshot wounds?
[00:09:35.821 --> 00:09:41.845]  And yes, he was shot twice in the face with a .38 Special.
[00:09:42.365 --> 00:09:44.286]  And he says this actually does happen.
[00:09:44.306 --> 00:09:47.108]  People do shoot themselves multiple times in the head.
[00:09:47.188 --> 00:09:48.929]  I know it's hard to believe, the coroner says.
[00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:53.752]  Folks, don't try this at home, but you shoot yourself in the head.
[00:09:53.792 --> 00:09:55.053]  Number one, it's pretty painful.
[00:09:57.566 --> 00:10:17.400]  You might get up the guts to do it once, but if you're not incapacitated or knocked out or dead, or in the process of dying, imagine shooting yourself once in the head with a powerful handgun at point-blank range, and then hocking it again, they say it was a revolver, and pulling the trigger again into his face.
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.142]  It was his father's revolver, supposedly.
[00:10:23.251 --> 00:10:24.692]  Again, these assassins are real good at that.
[00:10:24.712 --> 00:10:27.654]  They get into your house, get your gun, wait for you to come home and kill you.
[00:10:31.116 --> 00:10:32.777]  Just absolutely amazing.
[00:10:33.117 --> 00:10:39.921]  The only other places we've ever seen people shoot themselves multiple times is in Arkansas.
[00:10:40.021 --> 00:10:41.122]  And it happened several times.
[00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:52.349]  Fannie Malick was a local medical examiner who said that people who shoot themselves multiple times or stab themselves dozens of times or cut their own arms and legs off, he would say that was suicide.
[00:10:53.163 --> 00:10:54.064]  In the MENA area.
[00:10:56.085 --> 00:10:57.766]  Where a lot of this drug dealing was going on.
[00:10:59.287 --> 00:11:01.648]  And so he got promoted to the state medical examiner.
[00:11:03.849 --> 00:11:06.891]  By that wonderful individual, William Jefferson Clinton.
[00:11:06.911 --> 00:11:08.412]  That bastion of conservatism.
[00:11:08.712 --> 00:11:10.353]  Mrs. Bush is conservative, so is Bill Clinton.
[00:11:10.373 --> 00:11:13.515]  So we'll just start calling him the ultra-conservative Bill Clinton.
[00:11:14.695 --> 00:11:16.436]  And so the ultra-conservative Bill Clinton...
[00:11:18.368 --> 00:11:23.970]  Promoted this guy, and it's the only other place I've ever seen this, people shooting themselves multiple times in the head.
[00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:27.232]  I mean, people shooting themselves twice in the back of the head with shotguns and stuff.
[00:11:28.652 --> 00:11:37.936]  So now the coroner's come out and said, no, it wasn't a shotgun, it was a .38 Special, twice in the face, and yes, he shot himself twice with... I mean, folks, this is ridiculous.
[00:11:39.817 --> 00:11:43.739]  This is in the same category as pigs and elephants flying.
[00:11:44.887 --> 00:11:49.830]  And the cow jumping over the moon, and the Easter Bunny, and Santa Claus, and the Tooth Fairy.
[00:11:54.394 --> 00:11:57.195]  I mean, really, I probably shouldn't even go on with this.
[00:11:57.276 --> 00:12:04.621]  It's just that the average American, I guess, doesn't know about how firearms operate or how this works.
[00:12:04.741 --> 00:12:06.482]  I mean, the cops out there know.
[00:12:06.722 --> 00:12:09.164]  I mean, do people shoot themselves twice in the head, officers?
[00:12:09.284 --> 00:12:09.944]  Do they do that?
[00:12:11.065 --> 00:12:13.907]  You shoot yourself once in the head, and then, oh, I think I'll do it again.
[00:12:15.504 --> 00:12:18.146]  Again, if you're not dead, it almost always knocks you out.
[00:12:18.706 --> 00:12:20.608]  It causes so much pain, you fall to the ground.
[00:12:20.628 --> 00:12:22.889]  You know, then, oh, I didn't do it right that time.
[00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:25.311]  Let me shoot myself again in the face.
[00:12:25.371 --> 00:12:27.573]  By the way, you don't normally just aim it at your face and shoot.
[00:12:27.913 --> 00:12:34.218]  People know you stick it in your mouth, up in the roof of your mouth, and fire the bullet up to the soft palate, up into the brain.
[00:12:35.719 --> 00:12:38.321]  Or people like Hitler did, put it to their temple.
[00:12:40.522 --> 00:12:42.724]  Thanks to Hollywood, people know how to commit suicide.
[00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:48.450]  So, this is the new freedom.
[00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:55.152]  It is people shooting themselves twice in the face, and people actually come out and tell us this.
[00:12:55.672 --> 00:12:59.233]  The establishment has the nerve to tell us this.
[00:12:59.853 --> 00:13:07.876]  New York, and this is Associated Press of New York, the death investigative reporter Gary Webb has been confirmed as a suicide, according to the coroner's statement.
[00:13:08.336 --> 00:13:14.757]  There has been speculation that he may have met with foul play because he had received two gunshot wounds to the head.
[00:13:15.258 --> 00:13:15.718]  Oh, yeah.
[00:13:16.058 --> 00:13:16.458]  Oh, sure.
[00:13:17.512 --> 00:13:26.616]  The Sacramento Bee reported, the cause of the death was determined to be self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the head to the statement issued by the Sacramento County Coroner's Office.
[00:13:26.976 --> 00:13:39.422]  Quote, information and evidence gathered at the scene of the death, including a handwritten note, including an indication of the part of the deceit to take his own life, resulted in suicide as the determining manner of death.
[00:13:42.276 --> 00:13:49.639]  The statement was issued because of numerous calls to the coroner's office following a B report Sunday that Webb's death was caused by more than one wound.
[00:13:50.279 --> 00:13:55.581]  A former San Jose Mercury News reporter, Webb was found dead in his California home Friday morning.
[00:14:00.103 --> 00:14:09.727]  And of course, he gained attention in the late 1990s writing the Dark Alliance Pulitzer Prize winning series for the San Jose Mercury News about CIA drug trafficking.
[00:14:12.347 --> 00:14:17.350]  So I hope they don't come by and shoot me twice in the head and then say, or maybe ten times in the head.
[00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.152]  Alex Jones shot himself ten times in the head.
[00:14:20.172 --> 00:14:24.135]  And then he sprouted wings and flew around the moon four or five times.
[00:14:24.215 --> 00:14:27.737]  And then I went and fought Godzilla and took a ride in a flying saucer.
[00:14:27.797 --> 00:14:30.499]  And then I went and helped Santa deliver toys.
[00:14:30.559 --> 00:14:34.702]  And then I went and delivered money for the Tooth Fairy.
[00:14:36.303 --> 00:14:39.245]  And then I helped the Easter Bunny put eggs out in the backyard and
[00:14:41.815 --> 00:14:52.446]  I guess Gary Webb, you know, is... Again, this is the most ridiculous, disgusting thing I've ever heard of in my life.
[00:14:55.209 --> 00:14:56.210]  Oh, my goodness.
[00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:57.972]  It is unbelievable.
[00:14:59.413 --> 00:15:00.274]  Unbelievable.
[00:15:01.695 --> 00:15:04.879]  Lord Bush to sign Intel reform bills today.
[00:15:06.198 --> 00:15:09.442]  President Bush today will sign into law the largest overhaul of U.S.
[00:15:09.482 --> 00:15:11.705]  intelligence gathering in a half century.
[00:15:12.566 --> 00:15:16.652]  The measure creates a new intelligence director and counterterrorism center.
[00:15:17.012 --> 00:15:23.060]  It also tightens borders and aviation security, all aimed at preventing the lapses that...
[00:15:23.706 --> 00:15:26.348]  ...preceded the attacks on September 11th.
[00:15:26.448 --> 00:15:29.711]  Yes, let's give power, more power to those that carried the attacks out.
[00:15:30.131 --> 00:15:35.676]  Lawmakers from both parties joined President in praising a law that supporters say is needed to disrupt another plot.
[00:15:36.097 --> 00:15:39.820]  Later this afternoon, there will be a party at the White House, a celebration.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.322]  I'm going to have a celebration.
[00:15:42.362 --> 00:15:43.162]  The bill becomes law...
[00:15:44.628 --> 00:15:49.350]  As the man behind the strikes resurfaces, this time on the Internet, U.S.
[00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:52.652]  officials believe it is Osama bin Laden's voice praising an attack on the U.S.
[00:15:52.692 --> 00:15:54.053]  consul in Saudi Arabia this month.
[00:15:57.734 --> 00:16:01.356]  Popping up right before the election, Karl Rove said, Thank you, bin Laden, for the gift.
[00:16:01.396 --> 00:16:02.216]  Actually told the newspaper that.
[00:16:02.476 --> 00:16:03.677]  Thanks for the gift, bin Laden.
[00:16:03.697 --> 00:16:04.698]  Appreciate it.
[00:16:05.458 --> 00:16:06.378]  It's so obvious.
[00:16:07.559 --> 00:16:09.100]  Here's USA Today today.
[00:16:10.658 --> 00:16:13.740]  Again, they like to always announce what's passed after it passes.
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.242]  We beg the media to report on it.
[00:16:15.262 --> 00:16:16.282]  No one will report on it.
[00:16:17.383 --> 00:16:21.626]  Just said, oh, there's a bill that will keep you safe coming up so intelligence agencies can communicate.
[00:16:21.646 --> 00:16:22.687]  You're not against that, are you?
[00:16:23.248 --> 00:16:30.013]  And it had large sections of Patriot Act II, Total Information Awareness Network funding, TIPS program, Tattletail funding.
[00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:35.832]  National ID cards of the state, driver's license funding, internal checkpoint funding.
[00:16:35.852 --> 00:16:37.693]  We've had Congressman Ron Paul on to talk about it.
[00:16:38.053 --> 00:16:40.795]  We've read the bill here on air, given you the subsections.
[00:16:41.435 --> 00:16:44.477]  Well, now USA Today can tell you all about it today.
[00:16:44.937 --> 00:16:48.079]  Legislation sets stage for uniformed driver's license.
[00:16:49.429 --> 00:16:57.476]  The anti-terrorism bill to be signed by President Bush opens the door for people across the nation to have a similar driver's license.
[00:16:57.916 --> 00:17:03.701]  A plan that is fueling debate over whether security concerns will lead to what amounts to national identification card.
[00:17:04.102 --> 00:17:05.323]  Oh, it's fueling a debate!
[00:17:05.743 --> 00:17:13.830]  Federal biometric standardized driver's license hooked into all these databases, and it's fueling debate if this will be the ID card?
[00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:14.831]  So still there's the...
[00:17:16.224 --> 00:17:34.183]  The denial there, the bill which largely is aimed at improving the nation's intelligence gathering, not true, instructs the departments of Homeland Security and Transportation to meet with the nation's governors and state motor vehicles administrators to set uniform security standards for driver's licenses within the next year and a half.
[00:17:36.906 --> 00:17:43.272]  Such measures could include difficult-to-duplicate holograms, encrypted magnetic strips, and other embedded security features.
[00:17:43.812 --> 00:17:46.054]  The loss is biometrics already in in most states.
[00:17:47.255 --> 00:17:50.898]  A few states have begun including such features, 48 of them.
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:59.786]  Unlicensed Minnesota unveiled a license this month that includes a digital watermark and fine lines that are visible only to older violent life.
[00:18:00.626 --> 00:18:01.887]  And the digital photo and thumbprint.
[00:18:02.327 --> 00:18:18.934]  The American Association of Auto Vehicles Administrators, a Virginia-based group that represents administrators in all 50 states, has long called for standardized license, in part because of the ease with which criminals, illegal immigrants, alcohol-seeking teenagers, and others have been able to produce and obtain fake licenses.
[00:18:19.214 --> 00:18:26.137]  So then they give you all these excuses for something that's already in place and was in place in 42 states at the time of 9-11.
[00:18:27.449 --> 00:18:38.497]  And they admit it's to start a new national sales tax system where you'll have to swipe your card or thumb scan every time you buy or sell something because that's what will assess the graduated sales tax.
[00:18:38.537 --> 00:18:43.741]  You can't have the poor paying sales tax, so you've got to swipe the card to assess the tax.
[00:18:46.203 --> 00:18:49.185]  And there are conservative and liberal organizations...
[00:18:50.436 --> 00:18:52.957]  Bob Barr and others have been out criticizing it as horrible.
[00:18:53.397 --> 00:18:57.319]  Larry Pratt, Executive Director of Gun Owners of America, another group critical of national license.
[00:18:57.839 --> 00:19:01.280]  How much of a fishbowl will the average American be living in?
[00:19:03.101 --> 00:19:08.823]  And again, so we've got Gun Owners of America here quoted, standing up against it, and the ACLU.
[00:19:09.904 --> 00:19:10.864]  But what do they know?
[00:19:12.498 --> 00:19:17.202]  But the bill actually has a loophole where illegal aliens and foreigners are exempt from it.
[00:19:17.282 --> 00:19:18.323]  England's passing their own.
[00:19:18.363 --> 00:19:19.504]  They're exempt from it as well.
[00:19:19.544 --> 00:19:20.605]  That's the BBC.
[00:19:21.445 --> 00:19:25.208]  And so those that we actually have to worry about are exempt from it.
[00:19:26.309 --> 00:19:26.629]  Again.
[00:19:28.211 --> 00:19:28.991]  I got a bridge.
[00:19:29.111 --> 00:19:31.273]  I'll sell you if you think any of this will keep you safe.
[00:19:32.134 --> 00:19:34.776]  Maybe we believe that people can shoot themselves twice in the head.
[00:19:35.176 --> 00:19:36.057]  Maybe we believe.
[00:19:37.268 --> 00:19:39.610]  That national ID cards are good.
[00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.814]  Maybe we believe that mercury is nutritious, as the news tells us.
[00:19:43.895 --> 00:19:46.978]  Maybe we believe that Hitler was good.
[00:19:46.998 --> 00:19:47.619]  I don't.
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.261]  We believe slavery was good.
[00:19:50.402 --> 00:19:51.142]  I don't think it was good.
[00:19:51.903 --> 00:19:53.285]  But we're going back into slavery.
[00:19:53.865 --> 00:19:54.746]  Make no doubt about it.
[00:19:55.247 --> 00:19:56.588]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:19:56.668 --> 00:19:57.229]  Check it out.
[00:19:57.289 --> 00:19:57.789]  We'll be right back.

[00:20:02.926 --> 00:20:07.510]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.192]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[00:20:10.413 --> 00:20:11.954]  Achieve financial independence.
[00:20:12.334 --> 00:20:17.419]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.

[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.703]  Coins, and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.

[00:21:00.467 --> 00:21:02.067]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:21:02.428 --> 00:21:08.189]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:21:08.429 --> 00:21:13.570]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:21:13.911 --> 00:21:23.173]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, fried halomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:28.496]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:21:28.816 --> 00:21:32.819]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:21:33.019 --> 00:21:37.782]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:21:38.162 --> 00:21:44.066]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[00:22:01.334 --> 00:22:05.878]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glass, who is a pharmacist from Marks Plaza Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[00:22:05.999 --> 00:22:07.240]  Hi, Alan, welcome to the program.
[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:07.980]  Thank you, Marvin.
[00:22:08.181 --> 00:22:11.524]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[00:22:11.704 --> 00:22:12.245]  Is that true?
[00:22:12.465 --> 00:22:13.446]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[00:22:13.486 --> 00:22:16.449]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[00:22:16.509 --> 00:22:16.749]  prices.
[00:22:16.969 --> 00:22:19.011]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[00:22:19.031 --> 00:22:19.832]  They're very common.
[00:22:19.912 --> 00:22:23.095]  Those common drugs you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[00:22:23.135 --> 00:22:23.396]  price.
[00:22:23.676 --> 00:22:24.837]  Now what about Tamoxifen?
[00:22:24.877 --> 00:22:27.259]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:31.283]  Tamoxifen, you can see a 75% savings against the regular U.S.
[00:22:31.303 --> 00:22:31.564]  price.
[00:22:31.944 --> 00:22:34.387]  Now are these brand name products made by the same companies?
[00:22:34.627 --> 00:22:36.609]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[00:22:36.649 --> 00:22:38.671]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.
[00:22:38.931 --> 00:22:43.857]  So to save money on prescription drugs in Canada, call the toll-free number for your information package.

[00:23:00.983 --> 00:23:03.484]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:04.164 --> 00:23:10.805]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[00:23:11.986 --> 00:23:14.266]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[00:23:15.086 --> 00:23:21.248]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[00:23:22.222 --> 00:23:22.802]  We're good to go.
[00:23:22.822 --> 00:23:22.982]  I think?
[00:23:49.684 --> 00:23:50.304]  516-8736.
[00:23:53.205 --> 00:23:54.885]  Call now.
[00:23:54.905 --> 00:23:57.906]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:24:00.487 --> 00:24:18.492]  Coming up in about seven, eight minutes, we're going to have Dean Hagelin, one of the stars of The Lone Gunman, on the broadcast.
[00:24:20.319 --> 00:24:21.840]  And the episode was written in late 2000.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.841]  It aired in mid-2001.
[00:24:25.561 --> 00:24:35.184]  And in it, they're talking to one of the government agents, and they say, we know it's a war game scenario dealing with counterterrorism and hijackings.
[00:24:37.405 --> 00:24:39.986]  And then the government agent says, the Cold War is over.
[00:24:40.026 --> 00:24:40.906]  They need a threat.
[00:24:41.006 --> 00:24:41.987]  It isn't a drill.
[00:24:42.847 --> 00:24:44.007]  It's the real thing.
[00:24:44.127 --> 00:24:45.648]  The government's been told it's a drill.
[00:24:47.128 --> 00:24:58.577]  And then the government, a criminal element of it, takes control of a jet, a large passenger jet, by remote control to fly it into the World Trade Center.
[00:25:01.079 --> 00:25:04.902]  As a pretext for martial law, as a pretext to invade third world countries.
[00:25:06.223 --> 00:25:11.407]  Now in reality, on the morning of 9-11, the government was running 24 drills.
[00:25:12.909 --> 00:25:14.770]  Five drills in the New York area.
[00:25:15.442 --> 00:25:23.846]  Eastern Seaboard Corridor simulating hijacked jets flying into the World Trade Center, Pentagon, and other targets.
[00:25:24.667 --> 00:25:31.290]  At exactly the same time in the morning, the exact same drill was being run of exactly what really happened.
[00:25:32.311 --> 00:25:34.752]  Now, Tom Clancy wrote books about this happening.
[00:25:35.592 --> 00:25:37.774]  There were TV commercials where this happened.
[00:25:37.794 --> 00:25:43.376]  There were made-for-TV shows like The Lone Gunman that covered this in almost 100% detail.
[00:25:46.966 --> 00:25:48.227]  Everybody knew about this.
[00:25:48.588 --> 00:25:49.969]  I was talking about this on air.
[00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:59.016]  And talking to Dean Hagelin, who's good friends with the writers, who he talked to right after it happened, they said, look, everybody knew this stuff was a possibility.
[00:25:59.056 --> 00:26:00.177]  That's why we did the episode.
[00:26:00.417 --> 00:26:02.199]  And it just so happened to mirror reality.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:08.104]  But how did they get it down to a war game scenario as the smokescreen for carrying it out?
[00:26:08.945 --> 00:26:09.705]  I don't know, folks.
[00:26:09.765 --> 00:26:11.126]  It gets really, really scary.
[00:26:12.628 --> 00:26:14.009]  So we'll be talking to Dean Hagelin.
[00:26:15.055 --> 00:26:18.098]  Actor, comedian, writer, inventor.
[00:26:18.118 --> 00:26:19.779]  He invented something for your laptop computer.
[00:26:20.279 --> 00:26:21.000]  Interesting fellow.
[00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.881]  I spent a few hours with him at my home last night.
[00:26:23.222 --> 00:26:24.683]  He'll be on with us via cell phone.
[00:26:24.703 --> 00:26:28.666]  He's on the road coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:26:30.427 --> 00:26:32.289]  And again, you do not want to miss this.
[00:26:32.309 --> 00:26:42.377]  We're going to play some of the clips from the Lone Gunman episode we're talking about in question and then get Mr. Haglund on right after this quick break that we're about to take.
[00:26:43.644 --> 00:26:50.390]  I already covered how they're going to sign into law the National ID card today, and Bush is also going to be signing the new Freedom Initiative today, several bills.
[00:26:50.711 --> 00:26:51.732]  They're having a party.
[00:26:51.752 --> 00:26:53.853]  He wanted to celebrate this.
[00:26:54.434 --> 00:26:58.598]  Forced psychological testing, National ID cards, Patriot Act II.
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.480]  Here's some of the other news.
[00:27:01.901 --> 00:27:06.125]  Christians face 47 years in prison for reading Bible, praying on street.
[00:27:06.661 --> 00:27:08.281]  This is for the Center for Law and Policy.
[00:27:08.301 --> 00:27:10.262]  I have mainstream news articles on this.
[00:27:10.602 --> 00:27:14.443]  They read anti-homosexual passages out of their books.
[00:27:16.524 --> 00:27:20.785]  And whether you are for it or against it, you should be for their First Amendment.
[00:27:20.825 --> 00:27:23.125]  And they were taken up and arrested for inciting hatred.
[00:27:26.486 --> 00:27:29.467]  And face 47 years in prison.
[00:27:29.527 --> 00:27:30.227]  It's horrible.
[00:27:32.282 --> 00:27:33.763]  Another article, NBC6.
[00:27:33.843 --> 00:27:35.803]  Man dies after police use taser gun on him.
[00:27:36.123 --> 00:27:38.264]  Now it's what, about one person dies a week from these?
[00:27:40.124 --> 00:27:40.465]  U.S.
[00:27:40.505 --> 00:27:42.165]  drug approval process flawed.
[00:27:42.205 --> 00:27:43.846]  This is out of the news of Australia.
[00:27:45.066 --> 00:27:46.626]  Some of the horrible drugs have been approving.
[00:27:47.127 --> 00:27:49.347]  Australian teen killed by two great white sharks.
[00:27:51.008 --> 00:27:54.949]  A new fake bin Laden tape services will be covering that as well.
[00:27:56.249 --> 00:28:01.071]  And I have this article where some sicko, some demon from the pit...
[00:28:02.466 --> 00:28:06.789]  Killed a young woman who was eight months pregnant and took the baby out of her womb.
[00:28:06.809 --> 00:28:09.011]  And the father was at work.
[00:28:09.031 --> 00:28:11.192]  It was a new family.
[00:28:11.852 --> 00:28:13.514]  Just imagine the hell on earth.
[00:28:14.134 --> 00:28:15.815]  And why didn't she have a handgun?
[00:28:17.957 --> 00:28:20.158]  She was strangled and then had the baby cut out of her.
[00:28:21.779 --> 00:28:23.881]  And it's just such a horrible story.
[00:28:25.442 --> 00:28:27.463]  But a lot of people can't deal with evil.
[00:28:27.483 --> 00:28:28.824]  They don't know that evil exists.
[00:28:28.844 --> 00:28:29.584]  They're naive.
[00:28:30.245 --> 00:28:31.726]  Evil does exist.
[00:28:32.748 --> 00:28:33.809]  And it's spreading.
[00:28:34.869 --> 00:28:36.190]  And it's out of control.
[00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:51.937]  And we, the good folks, the people that love life, that love honor and decency and beauty, have to rally and ride out on the field and face down the forces of Mordor and of the great eye of the New World Order, the pyramidal power structure.
[00:28:53.218 --> 00:28:55.019]  And if we don't ride out and face it,
[00:28:55.928 --> 00:29:10.358]  We are going to be swept by this wickedness, and we're going to enter a new high-tech dark age, a technocracy of dehumanization, and our journey to serfdom and enslavement and feudalism will be complete.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:23.247]  The criminals have taken control of the government, and all of their pumps and minions are being put into positions of power, and wickedness is waxing greater and greater.
[00:29:23.979 --> 00:29:26.400]  But for every action, there's an equal or greater reaction.
[00:29:27.241 --> 00:29:30.903]  And when the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard against it.
[00:29:32.644 --> 00:29:36.066]  All right, Dean Hagelin is coming up after this quick break.
[00:29:37.526 --> 00:29:39.888]  Star of the Lone Gunman, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:39.908 --> 00:29:45.270]  The websites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:45.871 --> 00:29:46.291]  Stay with us.
[00:29:46.311 --> 00:29:46.911]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:50.313 --> 00:29:51.234]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.694 --> 00:29:53.255]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.228 --> 00:29:56.969]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.129 --> 00:30:02.629]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I've got a gripe.
[00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:05.930]  Recently, construction in my area has doubled my commute time.
[00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:09.731]  I'm spending up to four hours in stop-and-go rush hour traffic every day.
[00:30:09.911 --> 00:30:12.371]  The worst part is there's no good talk radio to listen to.
[00:30:12.531 --> 00:30:15.772]  But that doesn't matter to me anymore, thanks to the good people at Freeway Radio.
[00:30:15.952 --> 00:30:23.273]  I've got the Sony shortwave car stereo from Freeway Radio, and now I look forward to getting comfortable in my car and hearing the real scoop on the day's news.
[00:30:23.533 --> 00:30:25.214]  It's not just a shortwave radio, though.
[00:30:25.294 --> 00:30:29.135]  You can also get AM and FM, listen to cassette, and control your CD changer.
[00:30:29.215 --> 00:30:31.135]  Call Freeway Radio today, toll-free, 866-404-3600.
[00:30:31.155 --> 00:30:31.736]  That's 1-866-404-3600.
[00:30:31.796 --> 00:30:34.496]  Get your own Sony shortwave car stereo today for only $189.
[00:30:34.636 --> 00:30:36.257]  Install it in the boat, the RV, or your car.
[00:30:42.759 --> 00:30:43.660]  And let them do the same for you.
[00:30:59.412 --> 00:31:07.656]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:07.917 --> 00:31:12.279]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:12.559 --> 00:31:21.484]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:21.684 --> 00:31:25.306]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:25.606 --> 00:31:30.629]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:30.929 --> 00:31:37.652]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:38.132 --> 00:31:38.792]  What about you?
[00:31:39.453 --> 00:31:44.795]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:31:44.855 --> 00:31:45.876]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.159 --> 00:31:52.219]  1-888-803-4438
[00:32:00.023 --> 00:32:01.484]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:32:01.685 --> 00:32:09.031]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:32:09.351 --> 00:32:13.755]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:32:14.035 --> 00:32:23.864]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[00:32:24.624 --> 00:32:28.287]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[00:32:28.627 --> 00:32:31.109]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[00:32:31.409 --> 00:32:37.374]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[00:32:37.574 --> 00:32:39.215]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[00:32:39.416 --> 00:32:40.296]  Friends, don't wait.
[00:32:40.396 --> 00:32:43.358]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[00:32:43.539 --> 00:32:44.439]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[00:32:44.479 --> 00:32:44.679]  That's 800-255-1912.
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:46.301]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com.
[00:32:52.285 --> 00:32:53.926]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:32:53.946 --> 00:33:03.053]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:03.193 --> 00:33:05.375]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:33:21.189 --> 00:33:28.172]  I told the story briefly in the first five minutes of the broadcast that I got a call from a friend of mine, a local producer, radio producer.
[00:33:28.212 --> 00:33:34.054]  He said, you know, you ought to have, you ought to be interviewed by this Dean Hagelin, you know, of the Lone Gunman.
[00:33:35.395 --> 00:33:38.956]  And of course, stage and screen, he's also a well-known comedian.
[00:33:38.976 --> 00:33:43.358]  And I said, well, of course, I'd love to be interviewed by him for a little documentary he's making.
[00:33:43.498 --> 00:33:47.080]  And she said, good, he's coming into town today, this afternoon.
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:47.920]  That was yesterday.
[00:33:48.542 --> 00:33:54.538]  So I got to spend a couple hours with him at my home, and I interviewed him, he interviewed me, and it was a lot of fun.
[00:33:55.367 --> 00:33:57.469]  And I was shocked by how informed he was.
[00:33:57.889 --> 00:34:06.876]  You know him as the long, blonde-haired, kind of, I don't want to be mean about it, but geeky type, on-the-loan gunman, the computer hacker expert.
[00:34:06.896 --> 00:34:12.800]  Of course, in real life, he's nothing like that character, which shows you what a great actor he is.
[00:34:13.321 --> 00:34:15.302]  And so we're honored to have him join us.
[00:34:16.063 --> 00:34:17.344]  Dean, good to have you on with us.
[00:34:17.964 --> 00:34:19.045]  It's great to be here.
[00:34:19.165 --> 00:34:19.906]  Thanks for calling.
[00:34:20.518 --> 00:34:20.978]  You bet.
[00:34:21.319 --> 00:34:27.642]  I know that you're just about to leave Austin and you're out in the parking lot talking to us via cell phone.
[00:34:27.662 --> 00:34:29.043]  You'll be with us to the end of the hour.
[00:34:29.743 --> 00:34:32.305]  Let's talk about The Lone Gunman.
[00:34:32.905 --> 00:34:33.486]  Right.
[00:34:34.106 --> 00:34:35.607]  Episode number one.
[00:34:36.187 --> 00:34:38.549]  Tell us when this was written and when it aired.
[00:34:38.569 --> 00:34:44.872]  The pilot episode was written actually in March of 2000.
[00:34:45.613 --> 00:34:48.515]  It was written a little bit before that, but we shot it around March of 2000.
[00:34:49.873 --> 00:34:57.166]  And in that episode, we stopped the plane from flying into the World Trade Center, you know, eight months before it actually happened.
[00:34:57.947 --> 00:35:01.453]  So that was the whole plotline to it, and it was pretty freaky.
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:08.143]  Well, you know, I realized a question I didn't ask you last night when we talked on camera about this.
[00:35:08.684 --> 00:35:26.215]  Not only is the government remote controlling a passenger jet, a large jet, into the building to get martial law and to invade foreign countries, the cover for it is a war game, and in the real world, even the Associated Press has reported, there were war games that morning, and that's why NORAD stood down.
[00:35:26.455 --> 00:35:29.437]  War games are the exact same thing happening that actually happened.
[00:35:29.998 --> 00:35:31.739]  This is getting a little too weird, Dean.
[00:35:31.759 --> 00:35:31.999]  Okay.
[00:35:32.339 --> 00:35:39.241]  It's getting really weird, particularly when, you know, art is imitating life, imitating art, imitating simulations.
[00:35:40.722 --> 00:35:55.107]  And I believe that day was also weird because I was going to go to my local electronics store and get the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000, where you could actually fly a plane into the World Trade Center in the flight simulator, which were the ones apparently the hijackers were training with.
[00:35:56.423 --> 00:36:05.066]  And not only was I going to get it, I was going to get it because it was free that day, September 11, 2001, free Microsoft simulator with the $20 rebate.
[00:36:06.006 --> 00:36:11.268]  Oh, boy, lots of cryptic stuff.
[00:36:11.388 --> 00:36:11.828]  I know.
[00:36:12.408 --> 00:36:23.132]  On the one-year anniversary, the New York Lottery came up 9-1-1, and the Chicago Mercantile came up 9-1-1.0000, and that was less than one out of 14 billion.
[00:36:24.172 --> 00:36:25.653]  Wow, I didn't hear that.
[00:36:26.741 --> 00:36:27.702]  That's excellent.
[00:36:27.882 --> 00:36:29.202]  Does Jordan Maxwell know that one?
[00:36:30.083 --> 00:36:30.923]  I believe he does.
[00:36:32.124 --> 00:36:34.445]  You know, I brought this up to you on camera last night.
[00:36:34.465 --> 00:36:36.566]  What do you think really happened on 9-11?
[00:36:36.647 --> 00:36:46.812]  Well, I think, you know, in fact, I was watching your DVD, The Tyranny of 9-11, and it brought up a lot of compelling points.
[00:36:48.493 --> 00:36:50.254]  I think it was faked.
[00:36:51.014 --> 00:36:55.457]  And, you know, as an actor, you have to do research and you have to listen to all sides and you bring all of those in.
[00:36:55.956 --> 00:37:10.923]  Without judgment, but ultimately, when building a character, for instance, you take in all the relevant information, regardless of your personal bias to it, and you just lay that out.
[00:37:11.783 --> 00:37:19.286]  And ultimately, what happens is a bunch of that information weighs heavily to point to a certain area.
[00:37:19.847 --> 00:37:24.769]  And it seems a lot of the information now is pointing to the fact that it was taped.
[00:37:25.754 --> 00:37:26.374]  To some degree.
[00:37:27.455 --> 00:37:35.018]  Well, Dean Haglin, I totally agree with you, and I appreciate your courage and honesty in telling the listeners what you believe about this.
[00:37:35.418 --> 00:37:47.903]  Talking about Chris Carter, the developer, the person that created the X-Files and the Lone Gunman, you told me a story last night about the CIA and Hollywood parties.
[00:37:48.763 --> 00:37:49.383]  Oh, yeah.
[00:37:49.723 --> 00:37:50.724]  Well, this is really weird.
[00:37:51.903 --> 00:37:53.903]  And in fact, I met her since.
[00:37:54.023 --> 00:37:55.624]  She's a psychic in Hollywood.
[00:37:56.384 --> 00:38:02.685]  And she was at a Hollywood party where Chris Carter was standing in the corner in a tuxedo, looking very out of place.
[00:38:03.546 --> 00:38:08.467]  And she went up to him and said, whatever you're working on right now is going to make you millions of dollars.
[00:38:09.147 --> 00:38:11.147]  And it was just before he started the X-Files.
[00:38:11.947 --> 00:38:19.029]  So she was a psychic who predicted the success of the X-Files, not knowing what the project was or who he was.
[00:38:19.884 --> 00:38:23.025]  And then when I asked her, what were you doing at the Hollywood party?
[00:38:23.705 --> 00:38:35.907]  She said that she was working for the CIA and that she would get emails telling her to go to this party and that party and there'd be swanky affairs in the Hollywood Hills and her name would always be on the guest list.
[00:38:36.387 --> 00:38:37.547]  She never knew how that happened.
[00:38:38.187 --> 00:38:44.328]  And then she would just go hang out at the party and then at the end of the night go back and email what she talked about.
[00:38:45.088 --> 00:38:47.849]  And she didn't really know where the email went or who this person was.
[00:38:48.604 --> 00:38:49.845]  But then she would get a check.
[00:38:50.346 --> 00:38:53.770]  And it turns out that was the CIA.
[00:38:54.991 --> 00:39:08.145]  And they were just keeping tabs on what was being talked about at Hollywood parties with the producers and the creators because film is one of the major foreign policy tools that are out there.
[00:39:09.372 --> 00:39:17.474]  Well, you know, the president publicly a few years ago went to Hollywood with Lionel Chetwin and others and told Hollywood, no more X-File-type shows.
[00:39:17.674 --> 00:39:19.395]  We all want it to be pro-government.
[00:39:19.435 --> 00:39:27.157]  Now we see Threat Matrix, 24, all these different shows where the government's torturing people and killing people and taking over our liberties.
[00:39:27.197 --> 00:39:28.917]  But it's all for the better good, Gene.
[00:39:29.377 --> 00:39:34.979]  Right, because you can accomplish so much with torture, sarcastically speaking.
[00:39:36.181 --> 00:39:41.166]  Well, they just told the federal court, the Justice Department, two weeks ago that, yeah, we're using torture and we're going to use it in court.
[00:39:41.186 --> 00:39:44.448]  And the court said, yes, you can use this and make it admissible in court.
[00:39:44.509 --> 00:39:44.869]  Torture.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:47.660]  I didn't hear that.
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.341]  Does Amnesty International know about this?
[00:39:50.021 --> 00:39:51.041]  I would imagine they do.
[00:39:51.081 --> 00:39:52.322]  I haven't seen what they have to say about it.
[00:39:52.342 --> 00:39:53.862]  The point is it's all out in the open now.
[00:39:53.902 --> 00:39:59.263]  But shifting gears, just a little bit about yourself before we get back into the pilot episode of The Lone Gunman.
[00:39:59.563 --> 00:40:00.864]  We're in a hijacked jet.
[00:40:00.924 --> 00:40:03.604]  The government tries to fly it to the World Trade Center for martial law.
[00:40:03.925 --> 00:40:06.105]  Before we get back into that, tell us a little bit about yourself.
[00:40:06.425 --> 00:40:07.926]  You're not just an actor and a comedian.
[00:40:07.966 --> 00:40:11.907]  You also have invented something for the laptop computer.
[00:40:11.927 --> 00:40:13.147]  You gave me one yesterday.
[00:40:13.715 --> 00:40:14.355]  That's right.
[00:40:14.535 --> 00:40:16.236]  It's called the Chill Pack.
[00:40:16.936 --> 00:40:21.137]  As you know, all laptop computers now are made very thin and very fast.
[00:40:22.317 --> 00:40:25.538]  To do that, they have to sacrifice cooling fans on the CPU.
[00:40:26.958 --> 00:40:30.679]  Therefore, your laptop gets very hot along the bottom.
[00:40:30.719 --> 00:40:37.520]  In fact, they just came out with a study saying men using laptops may be a cause of infertility, of all things.
[00:40:40.612 --> 00:40:45.115]  My laptop, I was watching a DVD one day, and the whole movie locked up on me.
[00:40:45.676 --> 00:40:46.817]  And I happened to have a knee injury.
[00:40:46.837 --> 00:40:49.498]  I had a blue gel pack on my knee, cooling my knee down.
[00:40:49.859 --> 00:40:56.163]  And when I moved the laptop to the gel pack, the DVD started up because of direct exothermodynamic principles.
[00:40:57.104 --> 00:41:01.687]  So, of course, I nearly shorted out my system because condensation developed.
[00:41:02.328 --> 00:41:06.811]  And in the medical industry, they make this material that allows heat to transfer but no condensation to develop.
[00:41:07.392 --> 00:41:08.253]  I put the two together.
[00:41:08.273 --> 00:41:09.674]  It's called the Chill Pack.
[00:41:10.595 --> 00:41:12.818]  It sells for $19.95 at chillpack.com.
[00:41:13.718 --> 00:41:14.800]  Pack spelled P-A-K.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:17.642]  And they're selling like gangbusters.
[00:41:18.643 --> 00:41:19.384]  That's awesome.
[00:41:19.424 --> 00:41:22.928]  And, of course, deanhagelin.com as well.
[00:41:23.028 --> 00:41:25.090]  Now, I want to air this little four-minute clip.
[00:41:25.709 --> 00:41:28.150]  It's downloaded off the web, folks, so it's not the best.
[00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:35.152]  And this is where the characters are talking about a war game scenario and why elements of the government want to do this.
[00:41:35.172 --> 00:41:37.253]  So, Dean, I'm going to put you on hold for four minutes.
[00:41:37.273 --> 00:41:40.034]  We're going to play this clip and come back and get your response to it.
[00:41:40.654 --> 00:41:41.434]  Folks, here it is.
[00:41:42.674 --> 00:41:47.256]  We know it's a war game scenario and it has to do with airline counterterrorism.
[00:41:48.676 --> 00:41:50.857]  Why is it important enough to kill for?
[00:41:50.877 --> 00:41:52.197]  Because it's no longer a game.
[00:41:52.217 --> 00:41:52.257]  If
[00:41:54.835 --> 00:41:58.079]  Some terrorist group wants to act out this scenario.
[00:41:58.159 --> 00:42:00.341]  Why target you for assassination?
[00:42:00.742 --> 00:42:02.344]  Depends on who your terrorists are.
[00:42:02.364 --> 00:42:06.068]  The men who conceived of it in the first place.
[00:42:08.551 --> 00:42:12.135]  You're saying our government plans to commit a terrorist act against a domestic area?
[00:42:12.155 --> 00:42:12.535]  There you go.
[00:42:13.016 --> 00:42:14.698]  Indict the entire government, as usual.
[00:42:15.478 --> 00:42:15.798]  Facts.
[00:42:16.218 --> 00:42:18.440]  A small, factual, but possible game.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.001]  The Cold War's over, John.
[00:42:21.661 --> 00:42:24.783]  But with no clear enemy to stockpile against, the arms market's flat.
[00:42:25.383 --> 00:42:37.409]  But bring down a fully loaded 727 into the middle of New York City, and you'll find a dozen tin-pot dictators all over the world just clamoring to take responsibility and begging to be smart-bombed.
[00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:38.450]  I can't believe it.
[00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:40.351]  This is about increasing our sales.
[00:42:43.132 --> 00:42:43.352]  When?
[00:42:44.313 --> 00:42:44.633]  Tonight.
[00:42:46.122 --> 00:42:48.425]  How are you going to stop them?
[00:42:48.445 --> 00:42:49.246]  That's what it looks like.
[00:42:49.326 --> 00:42:50.708]  What does what look like?
[00:42:51.028 --> 00:42:52.249]  Auto protocol.
[00:42:52.329 --> 00:42:53.090]  Remote access.
[00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:54.652]  Somebody on the ground is flying your plane.
[00:42:55.493 --> 00:42:55.894]  Okay, sir.
[00:42:55.914 --> 00:42:57.095]  Keep your course.
[00:42:57.415 --> 00:42:59.478]  I need you on a flight plan.
[00:42:59.518 --> 00:43:00.999]  I'm mapping the data now.
[00:43:17.415 --> 00:43:18.976]  Your flight's going to make an unscheduled stop in exactly 22 minutes.
[00:43:30.655 --> 00:43:31.936]  The corner of Liberty and Washington.
[00:43:31.976 --> 00:43:32.957]  What will that have?
[00:43:32.977 --> 00:43:33.798]  The World Trade Center.
[00:43:33.818 --> 00:43:36.381]  I'm going to crash the plane into the World Trade Center.
[00:43:36.441 --> 00:43:37.502]  I'll tell the flight crew.
[00:43:37.562 --> 00:43:39.064]  Alright, try cutting electrical power.
[00:43:39.124 --> 00:43:39.784]  I've thought of that.
[00:43:39.884 --> 00:43:41.126]  I've thought of everything.
[00:43:56.425 --> 00:43:58.367]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain speaking.
[00:43:58.407 --> 00:44:01.589]  We're experiencing some technical difficulties out here.
[00:44:01.609 --> 00:44:04.411]  At this time, we'd like you all to return your seats.
[00:44:04.551 --> 00:44:05.712]  And kiss your asses goodbye.
[00:44:05.772 --> 00:44:07.594]  Finally, we're getting close.
[00:44:07.614 --> 00:44:07.974]  I know.
[00:44:07.994 --> 00:44:08.515]  I know.
[00:44:08.535 --> 00:44:08.975]  Damn it.
[00:44:09.015 --> 00:44:10.336]  We are at center.
[00:44:10.356 --> 00:44:12.698]  This is Atlantic National Flight 265 heavy.
[00:44:12.858 --> 00:44:14.319]  We are declaring an emergency.
[00:44:24.637 --> 00:44:30.459]  We have 110 souls on board, 16,000 pounds of fuel, and no dangerous goods or cargo to report.
[00:44:30.579 --> 00:44:34.901]  I don't know who Brody is.
[00:44:34.961 --> 00:44:39.042]  He must have failed, haven't he?
[00:44:39.082 --> 00:44:39.542]  Stop.
[00:44:40.303 --> 00:44:43.364]  I hope my next turn out as nice as my last.
[00:44:43.504 --> 00:44:44.384]  All right.
[00:44:48.166 --> 00:44:51.907]  And then at the last minute, Dean...
[00:44:52.995 --> 00:45:09.369]  Haglund, playing the character in the film with the new special super hacking chip, is able to take control of the remote control system, and the jet aircraft, the passenger jet, actually clips some of the antennas on top of one of the towers.
[00:45:09.689 --> 00:45:15.694]  Now, a war game scenario, that's the cover, but it isn't really a war game, it's the real thing.
[00:45:16.335 --> 00:45:18.417]  And then we learn from government sources...
[00:45:19.301 --> 00:45:32.748]  I reported this two months before the Associated Press did, we were the first, that drills were being run of flying hijacked jets in the World Trade Center, Pentagon, Capitol, the big insurance building in San Francisco, and other areas.
[00:45:33.969 --> 00:45:38.331]  There were 24 drills, five in the New York area, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:38.411 --> 00:45:40.612]  This is mainstream news.
[00:45:41.212 --> 00:45:41.953]  Dean Hagelin...
[00:45:43.065 --> 00:45:47.408]  This is getting just too close to the mark, too close to reality.
[00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:48.929]  Your comments?
[00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:58.596]  Well, you know, that clip, I hadn't heard it in quite some time and forgot how close the writers were when they wrote that eight months before it happened.
[00:45:59.417 --> 00:46:02.679]  And, of course, they were just picking up on popular culture.
[00:46:02.699 --> 00:46:11.686]  You know, Tom Clancy had written it in a book, and they just sort of put obvious scenarios together to make for exciting drama.
[00:46:13.412 --> 00:46:18.933]  When the actual day happened, I actually didn't put it together until the writers called me going, are you watching this?
[00:46:19.533 --> 00:46:22.894]  They were so freaked out by the coincidence.
[00:46:23.254 --> 00:46:25.655]  And tell folks who the writers were.
[00:46:26.155 --> 00:46:27.815]  They were the same writers from The X-Files.
[00:46:28.055 --> 00:46:31.996]  Vince Gilligan, I think, wrote the majority of that episode.
[00:46:32.436 --> 00:46:40.518]  And then Frank Spottnitz, John Scheiben, and Chris Carter also co-wrote and rewrote the script to get it into shape.
[00:46:41.358 --> 00:46:43.720]  All four of them were involved on working on that one.
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:52.367]  But then days after 9-11, Rice and Bush, all of them said no one had ever heard of a plan to fly a plane into a building, but not just movies and TV.
[00:46:52.788 --> 00:46:58.873]  They were running a drill that morning, my friend, so NORAD would think that it was just a drill and would stand down.
[00:46:59.554 --> 00:46:59.774]  Right.
[00:46:59.834 --> 00:47:00.915]  Planes were in the air.
[00:47:01.315 --> 00:47:04.738]  They could have taken down those jet fighters, or taken down the passenger airline.
[00:47:05.258 --> 00:47:06.680]  But they thought it was a drill.
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:07.780]  Thought it was a drill.
[00:47:08.841 --> 00:47:09.402]  Very clever.
[00:47:11.713 --> 00:47:24.079]  The Lone Gunman DVD set comes out this March, so anyone who doesn't want to download a poor quality clip off the Internet can wait until March, and it'll be in your blockbusters and Virgin record stores across the country.
[00:47:24.179 --> 00:47:26.401]  Oh, I'm going to march out and buy one.
[00:47:26.501 --> 00:47:27.081]  Are you kidding?
[00:47:27.601 --> 00:47:27.961]  That's right.
[00:47:27.981 --> 00:47:37.166]  We are actually providing commentary, and they were asking us for our views on the pilot episode, much as you are now, so it'll be interesting.
[00:47:37.246 --> 00:47:37.927]  I think all of us...
[00:47:46.419 --> 00:47:50.600]  Well, it's unbelievable, and I mean, I've got so many questions for him.
[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:51.181]  We're about to break.
[00:47:51.201 --> 00:47:54.802]  I've just got a few minutes left with you, but look.
[00:47:55.202 --> 00:48:05.224]  I mean, I can see doing a piece where a hijacked jet airliner by remote control flies into a building, but then it's so the government can blame Afghanistan, foreign governments.
[00:48:06.005 --> 00:48:06.465]  It's...
[00:48:07.401 --> 00:48:20.503]  Covered up by a war game scenario, and then I'm sure, have you heard that some of the firefighters have gone public and said, we found the undamaged three of the four black boxes, and we've been threatened to shut up about it?
[00:48:21.244 --> 00:48:22.244]  No, I didn't hear that.
[00:48:23.084 --> 00:48:27.085]  Yeah, that's been in the... They're supposed to survive anything, right?
[00:48:27.845 --> 00:48:28.345]  Yeah, they are.
[00:48:28.385 --> 00:48:31.106]  They drop them from thousands of feet, they put them in furnaces.
[00:48:31.906 --> 00:48:32.186]  Yeah.
[00:48:33.306 --> 00:48:33.606]  And yet...
[00:48:34.526 --> 00:48:37.368]  Now they've been found and they're being covered up.
[00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:41.871]  It's incredible.
[00:48:42.091 --> 00:48:46.274]  But again, I'm not saying that the writers of this were given inside information.
[00:48:47.615 --> 00:48:52.378]  But, I mean, what are the chances of them getting it all right?
[00:48:52.818 --> 00:48:55.079]  Other than the fact that you stopped it from happening.
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:56.600]  Yeah.
[00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:57.401]  Time to do sex.
[00:48:58.882 --> 00:49:02.884]  Well, again, the writers did have a lot of connections by that time in the X-Files.
[00:49:02.964 --> 00:49:03.365]  They had...
[00:49:04.727 --> 00:49:15.031]  You know, the FBI really enjoyed watching the X-Files, and towards the end of the show, NASA, everybody was coming to us with all sorts of things.
[00:49:15.711 --> 00:49:29.816]  In fact, at the International Space Station, there's ten robots that do maintenance around the outside of the International Space Station, and they call it Project X-Files, and each satellite is named after one of our characters.
[00:49:29.836 --> 00:49:33.858]  So there's a Langley satellite out there in space now.
[00:49:34.955 --> 00:49:36.116]  That is unbelievable.
[00:49:36.636 --> 00:49:36.996]  Isn't it?
[00:49:37.696 --> 00:49:40.578]  I'll tell you what's even more bizarre is you showing up at my door.
[00:49:40.998 --> 00:49:43.919]  Well, that was a lucky coincidence.
[00:49:43.939 --> 00:49:55.265]  You know, this documentary I'm filming, I have basically got my car in Los Angeles, drove to Tampa, now I'm on my way back, and I've been filming the whole thing to see what's going on in America today.
[00:49:56.886 --> 00:50:01.148]  You know, is it as divided as they say, or I have to go see for myself, and
[00:50:01.792 --> 00:50:07.577]  The documentary I got, including my interview with you in there, can be pretty cool.
[00:50:08.438 --> 00:50:09.799]  There's some real surprises.
[00:50:10.159 --> 00:50:16.185]  I learned a lot of things, and it'll be available on my website in a month or so when I cut it all together.
[00:50:16.678 --> 00:50:18.139]  Well, I can't wait to get a copy.
[00:50:18.679 --> 00:50:19.359]  Absolutely.
[00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:23.782]  Dean Haglund, again, one of the main stars, one of the central characters in The Lone Gunman.
[00:50:23.802 --> 00:50:26.503]  You've been in a lot of other, of course, productions as well.
[00:50:27.464 --> 00:50:33.967]  I'd like to be able to talk to Gilligan and Carter and others sometime and say, you know, did somebody plant this on you?
[00:50:34.627 --> 00:50:36.428]  Who recommended this to you?
[00:50:36.728 --> 00:50:38.629]  Where did you get these specific ideas?
[00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:41.031]  You know, that would be a great question.
[00:50:41.491 --> 00:50:45.793]  I don't know how much they're talking about it these days because they're all very busy on other projects.
[00:50:46.385 --> 00:50:49.526]  Can I ask you next time you talk to him to ask him when we can have you back on?
[00:50:50.166 --> 00:50:50.906]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:50:51.026 --> 00:50:52.086]  Tell you what, Dean, stay there.
[00:50:52.346 --> 00:50:53.166]  We've got a break.
[00:50:53.847 --> 00:50:55.067]  DeanHaglund.com.
[00:50:55.807 --> 00:50:56.847]  We'll be right back with him.
[00:50:56.867 --> 00:50:59.788]  I'm Alex Jones, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:51:00.368 --> 00:51:04.709]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:04.889 --> 00:51:09.310]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:09.450 --> 00:51:13.851]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:13.871 --> 00:51:15.191]  The New World Order.
[00:51:15.991 --> 00:51:16.972]  Pan-American.
[00:51:17.012 --> 00:51:21.233]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:21.293 --> 00:51:28.236]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:28.337 --> 00:51:30.457]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:30.678 --> 00:51:41.162]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.

[00:54:09.235 --> 00:54:12.377]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:14.565 --> 00:54:29.749]  Coming up, we have retired Rear Admiral, now Dean and President of the Franklin Pierce Law Center in Concord, New Hampshire, and others joining us to talk about Alberto I Love Torture Gonzalez for Attorney General.
[00:54:29.769 --> 00:54:30.889]  They're moving to block him.
[00:54:30.909 --> 00:54:34.430]  You don't want to miss the Admiral coming up.
[00:54:35.186 --> 00:54:38.308]  Dean Hagelin here in the final segment of this hour with us.
[00:54:38.328 --> 00:54:40.250]  I've been so honored to have you, Dean.
[00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:42.872]  DeanHagelin.com, and what did you say, ChillPack.com?
[00:54:43.452 --> 00:54:46.094]  ChillPack.com is the laptop cooling system, that's right.
[00:54:46.534 --> 00:54:47.295]  All right.
[00:54:47.855 --> 00:54:49.777]  And there's a curious spelling of pack.
[00:54:49.797 --> 00:54:50.337]  How do you spell it?
[00:54:50.918 --> 00:54:52.539]  Yeah, it's just a P-A-K, no C in there.
[00:54:53.189 --> 00:54:58.871]  All right, chillplag.com, deanhangland.com, anything else you wanted to add here in these last few minutes?
[00:54:59.391 --> 00:55:00.171]  Well, let's see.
[00:55:00.651 --> 00:55:11.134]  I'll be performing at science fiction conventions around the country and around the world, and I'll be at the Bay Area UFO Conference in April.
[00:55:11.374 --> 00:55:12.074]  Is that when that one is?
[00:55:12.995 --> 00:55:13.255]  Sure.
[00:55:13.295 --> 00:55:14.095]  In San Francisco.
[00:55:14.155 --> 00:55:17.736]  So there will be plenty of chances to see me live.
[00:55:17.796 --> 00:55:21.497]  I do stand-up comedy where I actually improvise an episode of The X-Files live on stage.
[00:55:21.737 --> 00:55:21.797]  Ha!
[00:55:22.415 --> 00:55:24.077]  Man, I got invited to that UFO conference.
[00:55:24.097 --> 00:55:24.697]  I ought to go to that.
[00:55:24.717 --> 00:55:25.318]  I hear it's big.
[00:55:25.558 --> 00:55:27.460]  Yeah, it was a lot of fun last time.
[00:55:28.681 --> 00:55:30.423]  I hear over a thousand folks show up.
[00:55:31.124 --> 00:55:32.085]  Yeah, it's really huge.
[00:55:32.185 --> 00:55:32.545]  It takes up...
[00:55:33.757 --> 00:55:35.719]  You know, two miles of convention floor space.
[00:55:35.819 --> 00:55:37.380]  That might be the one that even more show up to, 6,000.
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:38.261]  I don't know.
[00:55:38.681 --> 00:55:45.587]  But, Dean, all I can say is it blew my mind having you on, having you talk about, you know, the evidence pointing towards globalist involvement.
[00:55:45.607 --> 00:55:49.750]  And I agree, it's a tiny faction doing it, but it's a tiny faction in control.
[00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:50.731]  Yeah.
[00:55:50.971 --> 00:55:54.814]  Yeah, it's amazing how so few people can control so much.
[00:55:55.114 --> 00:56:01.279]  When you talk to the writers, and I don't want you to put words in their mouth, but when you talk to the writers and they called you and said, you know, this is the episode, are you watching?
[00:56:01.299 --> 00:56:02.100]  This is what we said.
[00:56:03.081 --> 00:56:06.446]  Did they say anything else about it being creepy or what they thought?
[00:56:07.147 --> 00:56:12.314]  Yeah, they were quite shaken up about it, and I think they still are.
[00:56:12.835 --> 00:56:17.201]  You know, they were quite disappointed when the whole series was canceled, because they really loved that show, and they really...
[00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:20.441]  You know, they liked working on the X-Files.
[00:56:20.802 --> 00:56:24.824]  Well, I said that I thought the Lone Gunman was much more serious topics.
[00:56:24.924 --> 00:56:27.866]  I thought, I said this on air, that it was a much better series.
[00:56:27.926 --> 00:56:32.048]  I know it got really good ratings, but I heard it was just Fox was angry.
[00:56:32.108 --> 00:56:33.029]  So why did they cancel it?
[00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:37.732]  Well, you know, there's a thousand reasons why any show gets canceled.
[00:56:38.212 --> 00:56:45.697]  But that was, you know, like any working relationship with management and creative types, there's going to be...
[00:56:48.368 --> 00:57:00.973]  So that decade-long thing has kind of gotten some friction.
[00:57:02.194 --> 00:57:03.634]  But I thought they always said media.
[00:57:03.654 --> 00:57:09.277]  I mean, this little radio show gets top ratings in markets, but sometimes gets canceled, and they say it's because of what you say.
[00:57:09.537 --> 00:57:11.638]  So it isn't really about ratings, huh?
[00:57:11.998 --> 00:57:13.739]  No, it's not about ratings.
[00:57:15.110 --> 00:57:16.951]  That's why your favorite shows go off the air.
[00:57:18.572 --> 00:57:19.193]  Unbelievable.
[00:57:19.253 --> 00:57:22.055]  Well, Dean Hagelin, I look forward to talking to you in the future.
[00:57:22.075 --> 00:57:26.479]  I look forward to seeing this film you're making, and God bless you, my friend.
[00:57:27.039 --> 00:57:28.981]  Likewise, and great being on the show, Alex.
[00:57:29.441 --> 00:57:30.622]  Take care and safe driving.
[00:57:31.143 --> 00:57:31.663]  Thank you, sir.
[00:57:31.703 --> 00:57:32.344]  I'll talk to you soon.
[00:57:32.484 --> 00:57:32.764]  Bye-bye.
[00:57:33.448 --> 00:57:36.230]  All right, there goes Dean Hagelin in the last minute of this hour.
[00:57:36.731 --> 00:57:37.131]  You heard him.
[00:57:37.171 --> 00:57:38.132]  He's got Road to Tyranny.
[00:57:38.152 --> 00:57:39.193]  He's got some of the other videos.
[00:57:39.213 --> 00:57:39.733]  He likes them.
[00:57:40.254 --> 00:57:41.555]  Why shouldn't you get some?
[00:57:42.396 --> 00:57:49.081]  Only for three or four more days can you get DVDs as low as $5.95 with my latest film.
[00:57:49.101 --> 00:57:50.562]  You buy one copy at a regular price.

[00:57:52.104 --> 00:57:53.685]  Same thing with 9-11 and Road to Tyranny.
[00:57:53.725 --> 00:57:55.386]  As many copies as you want for $5.95.
[00:57:55.486 --> 00:57:57.148]  And we have a 9-11 special.
[00:57:57.408 --> 00:57:58.549]  A bunch of different specials.
[00:57:58.889 --> 00:58:00.510]  Call and ask about them.
[00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:01.651]  No obligation.
[00:58:01.671 --> 00:58:02.411]  Just call and ask.
[00:58:02.752 --> 00:58:08.335]  I don't have time to talk about it.
[00:58:08.355 --> 00:58:08.736]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:09.076 --> 00:58:12.398]  Call right now, folks.
[00:58:12.418 --> 00:58:12.898]  888-253-3139.

[00:58:56.001 --> 00:58:56.581]  Big Brother
[00:58:57.282 --> 00:58:58.323]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:59.044 --> 00:59:00.145]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:00.805 --> 00:59:01.626]  You want answers?
[00:59:02.406 --> 00:59:03.287]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:03.307 --> 00:59:07.631]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:08.131 --> 00:59:12.975]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.537 --> 00:59:17.279]  I'm going to be off air a couple days next week.
[00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:21.703]  And when I am, we're going to be rebroadcasting what you just heard in the last hour.
[00:59:22.563 --> 00:59:24.285]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:59:26.055 --> 00:59:27.057]  Unbelievable!
[00:59:28.541 --> 00:59:32.131]  We had a very popular actor, a lot of different TV shows and stuff, movies.
[00:59:33.123 --> 00:59:36.484]  We had Dean Haglund on, one of the stars.
[00:59:36.584 --> 00:59:37.444]  Well, he was in X-Files.
[00:59:37.464 --> 00:59:41.565]  He was also, of course, one of the main stars in The Lone Gunman.
[00:59:42.285 --> 00:59:49.887]  Their pilot episode was the government hijacking a jet by remote control to fly it into the World Trade Center to bring in martial law and to be able to invade countries.
[00:59:49.927 --> 00:59:54.108]  And the government was going to do it and have NORAD stand down by having a drill.
[00:59:54.548 --> 00:59:55.668]  But it wasn't really a drill.
[00:59:56.088 --> 00:59:59.709]  And then, a few months later, the exact same thing happened in reality.
[01:00:01.013 --> 01:00:03.633]  With drills, using it to have NORAD stand out.
[01:00:03.914 --> 01:00:07.694]  And he said that he believes, obviously, that the government is behind 9-11.
[01:00:09.374 --> 01:00:15.156]  And he went on to talk about how the CIA and NASA would plant stories with him, give them suggestions.
[01:00:18.076 --> 01:00:20.316]  Unbelievable interview.
[01:00:20.656 --> 01:00:27.218]  And this guy, literally, I got a call three hours before he showed up at my house by a producer going, you want to talk to Dean Hagelin?
[01:00:28.018 --> 01:00:29.098]  Well, he's in your neighborhood.
[01:00:30.171 --> 01:00:31.972]  And Dean Hagelin's showing up at my door.
[01:00:32.012 --> 01:00:35.293]  I mean, my life is an X-Files episode!
[01:00:35.813 --> 01:00:36.594]  Ha ha ha!
[01:00:38.374 --> 01:00:39.515]  It's weird, folks.
[01:00:39.715 --> 01:00:40.455]  Real weird.
[01:00:41.616 --> 01:00:42.776]  But, uh, I don't know.
[01:00:43.496 --> 01:00:45.877]  Ha ha, just, it's a lot of fun.
[01:00:46.418 --> 01:00:48.879]  It's scary, though, because we're dealing with real stuff.
[01:00:49.539 --> 01:00:50.779]  But an amazing interview.
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:55.141]  We have an Admiral coming on here in 30 minutes.
[01:00:55.221 --> 01:00:58.163]  You do not want to miss this interview.
[01:00:58.183 --> 01:00:58.223]  Um,
[01:01:00.083 --> 01:01:10.109]  What the Admiral is doing is admirable, prodigious, in the greatest term I can use to describe the level of it.
[01:01:10.689 --> 01:01:18.574]  They're going after Lord Bush's nominee, Alberto, I love torture, we're above the law, Gonzalez.
[01:01:19.554 --> 01:01:24.397]  And so that is coming up here in about 27 minutes.
[01:01:25.458 --> 01:01:27.299]  You do not want to miss that.
[01:01:28.126 --> 01:01:30.987]  Before we get the guest on, we will take some calls.
[01:01:31.007 --> 01:01:34.168]  I'm going to give each caller about a minute or so because I want you all to have a chance to get involved on air.
[01:01:35.469 --> 01:01:36.449]  We even have some open lines.
[01:01:36.509 --> 01:01:37.769]  Here's the number for the first time today.
[01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:39.350]  1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 It is the 17th day of December, 2004.
[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:52.642]  And I'm here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:01:52.702 --> 01:01:53.542]  until 2 p.m.
[01:01:53.902 --> 01:01:55.143]  Central Standard Time.
[01:01:55.403 --> 01:01:58.605]  And then, of course, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[01:01:58.865 --> 01:02:18.495]  Not just going out on the AM and FM dial from Rochester, New York to Pensacola, Florida to Los Angeles, California, but simulcasting on Global Shortwave at 9.985 during the day and 3210 at night and the Internet at Infowars.com and Infowars.net.
[01:02:20.768 --> 01:02:24.991]  Christians face 47 years in prison for reading Bible, praying on street.
[01:02:25.291 --> 01:02:26.591]  This is mainstream news.
[01:02:26.852 --> 01:02:28.653]  This is not France or Germany.
[01:02:29.013 --> 01:02:30.854]  This is the United States.
[01:02:32.195 --> 01:02:34.256]  Man dies after police use taser gun on him.
[01:02:35.236 --> 01:02:42.781]  Some sicko from the pit of Lucifer's nest went in and murdered a young woman who was eight months pregnant, stole the baby, cut it out of her.
[01:02:43.806 --> 01:02:44.827]  So we can have our little minions.
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:15.361]  Very disgusting.
[01:03:16.202 --> 01:03:19.886]  So I'll recap and go over some of that as well.
[01:03:20.427 --> 01:03:22.008]  Again, the toll-free number.
[01:03:22.028 --> 01:03:22.769]  Join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:03:22.909 --> 01:03:25.492]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[01:03:33.928 --> 01:03:37.970]  After this break, then I'll go back into some of these top news stories.
[01:03:38.110 --> 01:03:49.055]  But I'm just blown away by the video interview I did on tape last night with Dean Hagelin and the one I did just now in the last hour on this worldwide transmission against tyranny.
[01:03:51.411 --> 01:03:58.255]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:03:58.555 --> 01:03:59.935]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:00.136 --> 01:04:02.337]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:02.477 --> 01:04:04.578]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:04.858 --> 01:04:09.781]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:10.121 --> 01:04:14.163]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:14.403 --> 01:04:14.984]  We're good to go.
[01:04:29.377 --> 01:04:29.577]  That's 888-2533-139.
[01:04:29.617 --> 01:04:31.860]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:32.841]  Again, that number, 888-2533-139.
[01:04:50.819 --> 01:04:51.580]  Terrorism.
[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:52.480]  Terrorism.
[01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:53.401]  Chemical attacks.
[01:04:53.481 --> 01:04:54.161]  Dirty bombs.
[01:04:54.241 --> 01:04:54.662]  Fallout.
[01:04:54.742 --> 01:04:55.742]  Biological attack.
[01:04:55.922 --> 01:04:56.443]  Anthrax.
[01:04:56.523 --> 01:04:58.644]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:04:58.904 --> 01:05:00.485]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:05:00.726 --> 01:05:03.227]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:03.608 --> 01:05:18.177]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:18.217 --> 01:05:18.538]  government.
[01:05:18.718 --> 01:05:20.519]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:05:20.879 --> 01:05:26.784]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:26.924 --> 01:05:31.428]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.

[01:05:50.279 --> 01:05:53.944]  You've heard about PAWS from BioOx International and its Bubble Up technology.
[01:05:54.244 --> 01:05:58.549]  But have you heard about BioOx Citrus Concentrate that also uses Bubble Up technology?
[01:05:58.769 --> 01:06:05.738]  BioOx Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[01:06:06.118 --> 01:06:12.740]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds, your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color crayons.
[01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:16.522]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with BioOx Citrus Concentrate.

[01:06:40.611 --> 01:06:43.132]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[01:06:43.312 --> 01:06:48.014]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use the BioWox family of products.
[01:06:52.577 --> 01:06:58.620]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:02.202]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:12.134 --> 01:07:25.404]  We've got a retired admiral coming on to talk about why his organization, he's the dean of a law school, is going after Alberto, I love, torture Bush's above federal law, Gonzalez.
[01:07:26.185 --> 01:07:27.906]  That's coming up in about 25 minutes.
[01:07:28.366 --> 01:07:31.649]  Right now, let's go to the calls and I'll plunge back into the news.
[01:07:32.109 --> 01:07:33.490]  John in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[01:07:33.530 --> 01:07:33.931]  Go ahead.
[01:07:34.231 --> 01:07:34.431]  Hello.
[01:07:35.071 --> 01:07:35.831]  The U.S.
[01:07:35.871 --> 01:07:42.074]  Marine Corps at Quantico, Virginia, has an X-Files division, and it uses robot aircraft for urban combat.
[01:07:42.695 --> 01:07:45.736]  Its logo was a dragon eating the World Trade Center before 9-1-1.
[01:07:45.876 --> 01:07:46.917]  Yeah, I know.
[01:07:46.957 --> 01:07:49.778]  I was there for that urban warfare training drill in 99.
[01:07:49.818 --> 01:07:51.399]  That's in my film, Police State 2000.
[01:07:52.799 --> 01:07:53.579]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:07:53.619 --> 01:07:58.842]  And they had another logo of a Crosshairs on a building that looked just like that.
[01:07:58.922 --> 01:08:02.985]  That was the 1999 anti-terrorism official FEMA report.
[01:08:03.245 --> 01:08:04.966]  Metropolis, Project Metropolis.
[01:08:05.026 --> 01:08:07.827]  And it showed Crosshairs exactly on the points that were hit, yeah.
[01:08:08.127 --> 01:08:14.851]  And what did Mr. Haglund say to you about the lone gunman being copied from Operation Northwood?
[01:08:15.666 --> 01:08:18.569]  You know, I should have, again, I interviewed him last night.
[01:08:18.689 --> 01:08:20.030]  I mentioned Northwoods to him.
[01:08:20.050 --> 01:08:23.614]  He was not aware of it in the video interview we did.
[01:08:23.654 --> 01:08:27.518]  But you heard him say that the CIA and NASA would go to the parties.
[01:08:27.558 --> 01:08:28.279]  They would call up.
[01:08:28.299 --> 01:08:29.520]  They'd plant stories on them.
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:34.425]  They've named spy satellites after X-Files characters and episodes.
[01:08:35.146 --> 01:08:38.489]  And he said, yeah, a lot of the stories were basically given to him by the government.
[01:08:39.184 --> 01:08:43.248]  He came out and just said that last hour, and that he believes the government was behind 9-11.
[01:08:43.268 --> 01:08:50.356]  Well, he's got to be scared to death when he sees your video and looks up Operation Northwoods for himself.
[01:08:50.736 --> 01:08:51.817]  He has seen the video now.
[01:08:52.498 --> 01:08:53.879]  I gave him a copy last night.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:54.941]  And that'll soak in.
[01:08:54.961 --> 01:08:56.502]  That'll take a few days to soak in.
[01:08:56.522 --> 01:09:01.828]  But when he looks up Operation Northwoods, he's going to realize where that story came from, and it's real.
[01:09:03.089 --> 01:09:05.191]  Yeah, now again, folks, we aired it last hour.
[01:09:05.211 --> 01:09:06.132]  I'm not going to play it again.
[01:09:06.192 --> 01:09:09.756]  It's on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com right now.
[01:09:11.338 --> 01:09:15.162]  The pilot episode, and they had a whole bunch of episodes, but it was the first one.
[01:09:16.730 --> 01:09:29.004]  Written in March of 2000, written right before that, shot in March of 2000, the secret government group hijacks a jumbo jet by remote control to fly to the World Trade Center for martial law to invade Afghanistan, basically.
[01:09:29.504 --> 01:09:36.392]  And the cover is that it's just a war game scenario, but no, it's real, because the Cold War is over, John, is what he said.
[01:09:37.232 --> 01:09:44.795]  Pun intended, you're John, but the film, The Cold War is over, John, and so they need a new enemy, the war on terror, and then exactly that happens.
[01:09:44.855 --> 01:09:46.996]  So it's war game drills to stand down.
[01:09:47.576 --> 01:09:52.058]  It's the same target, why the government's doing it, remote control, all of this.
[01:09:52.118 --> 01:09:55.839]  I mean, this, and he basically said, yeah, they would plant stories on us.
[01:09:56.159 --> 01:09:57.000]  Did you hear that?
[01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:58.480]  Yes.
[01:09:59.341 --> 01:10:01.902]  Hollywood, Hollywood is a strange place anyway.
[01:10:01.962 --> 01:10:05.523]  Well, he said it's the outward extension of the globalist propaganda.
[01:10:06.328 --> 01:10:10.810]  Yeah, it's terrifying that they were so accurate.
[01:10:13.051 --> 01:10:15.351]  Well, I mean, they were 99%.
[01:10:15.391 --> 01:10:19.513]  The 1% is that in the movie, they stopped the plane from flying into the center.
[01:10:20.893 --> 01:10:27.936]  I would like to think that that was some good, honest CIA agent trying to stop the September 11th attacks.
[01:10:28.136 --> 01:10:29.897]  I would like to believe that.
[01:10:30.197 --> 01:10:32.198]  They weren't supposed to declassify Northwood.
[01:10:32.298 --> 01:10:35.559]  Somebody took it out of the classified area, put it in those stacks...
[01:10:36.884 --> 01:10:41.207]  And then Bamford found it, and then they admitted it's real and confirmed it.
[01:10:41.628 --> 01:10:43.549]  So yeah, no, no, we have good people in the government.
[01:10:43.569 --> 01:10:45.070]  Look, who do you think called me up?
[01:10:45.974 --> 01:10:52.216]  Even before we had Hilton on, and I got from a different source, and, oh, the government was running a drill that morning of flying hijacked jets.
[01:10:52.536 --> 01:11:00.978]  Then two months after we report that, the CIA comes out and the Associated Press goes, yeah, it's true, but it's just a coincidence, and puts their spin on it.
[01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:05.059]  So, I mean, look, a lot of good people care.
[01:11:05.379 --> 01:11:11.100]  I've got an admiral coming on in 20 minutes to talk about Gonzalez, how bad he is.
[01:11:12.116 --> 01:11:19.102]  Yeah, that's scary that 30 million illegal aliens get a driver's license and fake ID today when Bush signs that paperwork.
[01:11:19.462 --> 01:11:21.164]  Yeah, no, no, this is the amnesty.
[01:11:21.344 --> 01:11:26.589]  Actually, this bill isn't just a national ID card for us and Patriot Act II, a lot of sections of that.
[01:11:26.929 --> 01:11:30.912]  It actually says we'll accept all theirs, give them cards, and accept matricula.
[01:11:30.932 --> 01:11:35.516]  So it makes us more open to attack, as Ron Paul said, not just my opinion, people.
[01:11:36.037 --> 01:11:37.258]  Ron Paul said it, it's in the bill.
[01:11:37.298 --> 01:11:37.838]  Thanks for the call.
[01:11:38.499 --> 01:11:39.620]  I mean, come on, it just...
[01:11:40.453 --> 01:11:48.641]  Of course, if you believe this bill's good for America, you probably believe that CIA exposer, Bill's surprise winner, Gary Webb, shot himself twice in the face with a revolver.
[01:11:49.082 --> 01:11:49.762]  It's impossible.
[01:11:50.243 --> 01:11:51.804]  But the coroner says, oh, it happens.
[01:11:51.824 --> 01:11:53.526]  Yeah, it happens in Arkansas.
[01:11:54.046 --> 01:11:55.648]  And Fannie Malick's the medical examiner.
[01:11:56.549 --> 01:11:58.070]  Let's talk to Eric in Connecticut.
[01:11:58.170 --> 01:11:58.931]  Eric, go ahead.
[01:11:59.292 --> 01:11:59.752]  Hello, Alex.
[01:11:59.792 --> 01:12:01.534]  Welcome from Beelzebub's sandbox.
[01:12:02.136 --> 01:12:02.617]  That's right.
[01:12:03.337 --> 01:12:04.979]  How close are you to New Haven up there?
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:08.864]  I'm about an hour, I'd say about 45 miles to the east of New Haven.
[01:12:09.144 --> 01:12:11.647]  From the tomb, headquarters of the Order of Death.
[01:12:11.747 --> 01:12:12.208]  Exactly.
[01:12:12.868 --> 01:12:15.151]  Hey, Alex, I'm glad you brought up the whole thing with Gary Webb.
[01:12:15.291 --> 01:12:21.018]  There is a clip on whatreallyhappened.com, Michael Rivero's website.
[01:12:21.912 --> 01:12:33.394]  Where there is a graphic film, and I say this is very... No, no, we have links to it on prisonplanet.com, and to explain to folks, these are people who've blown their heads off on live TV.
[01:12:33.714 --> 01:12:41.515]  Yes, well... It's happened quite a few times, and it shows you what happens when you put one bullet into your head, you don't then cock the revolver and do it again.
[01:12:41.776 --> 01:12:49.817]  No, I know a few things about firearms, Alex, and as most gun owners will know, firearms are measured, their power is measured by kinetic energy.
[01:12:50.546 --> 01:12:52.727]  Now, they say Vince Foster killed himself with a .38.
[01:12:53.407 --> 01:12:58.070]  Most often, exit wounds will not occur with a .38 unless it's plus P.
[01:12:58.090 --> 01:12:59.610]  .357 is like 300 pounds at the muzzle.
[01:12:59.630 --> 01:13:00.671]  A .38 will have maybe 150.
[01:13:05.652 --> 01:13:09.174]  A shotgun, anywhere from 1,000 to 2,000 foot-pounds.
[01:13:09.234 --> 01:13:15.056]  So the bottom line is, you put a gun in your mouth and you swallow a bullet, you ain't going to cock the gun and pull the trigger again.
[01:13:15.416 --> 01:13:18.638]  Because, look, you can put a gun to somebody's head with blanks.
[01:13:18.718 --> 01:13:19.898]  It almost always kills them.
[01:13:20.139 --> 01:13:22.300]  The gas blows a chunk of your skull in.
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:27.322]  Imagine, folks, it'd be like popping an 18-wheeler tire in your mouth.
[01:13:27.802 --> 01:13:31.284]  Just the blast alone knocks out your teeth and sends you back flying.
[01:13:31.644 --> 01:13:32.064]  That's right.
[01:13:32.344 --> 01:13:32.704]  No, no, no.
[01:13:32.724 --> 01:13:34.285]  Gary Webb shot himself twice in the head.
[01:13:34.745 --> 01:13:36.486]  That's what the coroner says, so just believe it.
[01:13:36.686 --> 01:13:37.486]  Well, you know what, Alex?
[01:13:37.546 --> 01:13:42.608]  I've come to the conclusion that a lot of these officials, I wouldn't believe them if they told me rain was wet.
[01:13:44.829 --> 01:13:45.509]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:13:45.849 --> 01:13:46.749]  Thanks for the call.
[01:13:46.829 --> 01:13:49.330]  Yeah, the official coroner, he was not a shotgun.
[01:13:49.370 --> 01:13:51.631]  He shot himself twice in the head with a .38 Special.
[01:13:53.332 --> 01:13:56.853]  Just bigger than a .38 and smaller than a, you know, less powder.
[01:13:58.458 --> 01:13:59.618]  Yeah, 357.
[01:13:59.678 --> 01:14:03.781]  Let us now talk to... It's considered a high-powered handgun.
[01:14:04.542 --> 01:14:06.543]  Let's now talk to Rick in California.
[01:14:06.603 --> 01:14:07.123]  Rick, hello.
[01:14:07.143 --> 01:14:08.084]  Hi, Alex.
[01:14:08.144 --> 01:14:09.265]  I just had a quick question.
[01:14:09.585 --> 01:14:21.333]  With the Patriot Act II and the National ID Card Pass, how soon do you think we will actually see everything that is written in the bill
[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:23.521]  Implemented.
[01:14:23.541 --> 01:14:31.826]  You know, it could be ten years or it could be next week if the globalists decide to set a city on fire with a suitcase nuke, a stone burner.
[01:14:32.267 --> 01:14:35.189]  Do you think that... Because I firmly believe that within...
[01:14:35.819 --> 01:14:39.020]  Ten years, we'll see full military presence in the street and checkpoint.
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:39.720]  Well, what do you think?
[01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:42.161]  The police call themselves paramilitary.
[01:14:42.201 --> 01:14:43.301]  They call us civilians.
[01:14:43.801 --> 01:14:45.662]  Well, they're civilians, too, but no, not anymore.
[01:14:46.222 --> 01:14:47.422]  We're an occupied territory.
[01:14:47.442 --> 01:14:57.605]  When you've got police calling you civilians, whether they know it or not, on their own handbooks, this is a military dictatorship, and now they're saying they're getting rid of Posse Comitatus, and you see troops all over the country.
[01:14:58.906 --> 01:15:00.366]  But not on the border, brother.
[01:15:01.048 --> 01:15:04.609]  I wonder how it's going to be with all the protesters at Inauguration Day.
[01:15:05.089 --> 01:15:07.290]  Well, the protesters are saying they're going to turn their back.
[01:15:08.050 --> 01:15:13.311]  There were protesters throwing eggs at the armored vehicle all that last time.
[01:15:15.232 --> 01:15:18.833]  I wonder if they're just going to be openly arresting the people turning their backs.
[01:15:19.693 --> 01:15:23.014]  I wonder if they'll even do that in front of everybody.
[01:15:24.005 --> 01:15:25.025]  Well, they already do it.
[01:15:25.065 --> 01:15:36.750]  In New York, sir, over 2,000 innocent people, small children, families, tourists, conservative writers for the Spectator, AP writers, BBC reporters were just massively arrested.
[01:15:36.770 --> 01:15:43.913]  I mean, they'd just be walking down the street and they'd just form these orange nets and just net everybody and then go put them in a camp.
[01:15:44.053 --> 01:15:49.095]  When you were reporting that at the RNC, did you get any film footage of any of that?
[01:15:49.315 --> 01:15:49.575]  Yes.
[01:15:49.995 --> 01:15:52.636]  Because I have American Dictators...
[01:15:53.109 --> 01:15:54.569]  I really didn't see any of that in there.
[01:15:54.629 --> 01:15:56.930]  Well, American Dictators was made before the election.
[01:15:57.230 --> 01:15:59.711]  Okay, will you do another documentary including all that?
[01:16:00.251 --> 01:16:01.311]  Yeah, I'm making it right now.
[01:16:01.351 --> 01:16:04.772]  There's a trailer for it on Infowars.com.
[01:16:04.812 --> 01:16:08.592]  It's called Martial Law 9-1-1 Rise of the Police State.
[01:16:08.613 --> 01:16:08.953]  Oh, great.
[01:16:09.113 --> 01:16:09.493]  Wonderful.
[01:16:09.773 --> 01:16:10.873]  All right, well, thank you for your time.
[01:16:11.653 --> 01:16:12.693]  Appreciate the call.
[01:16:14.134 --> 01:16:16.514]  Yes, that's why I've been working 18 hours a day again.
[01:16:16.594 --> 01:16:19.455]  I'm making the film on top of doing this radio broadcast and...
[01:16:20.714 --> 01:16:21.134]  We're good to go.
[01:16:21.214 --> 01:16:21.814]  We're good to go.
[01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:50.861]  I'm going to hang around, get the chores done around here in Austin a little bit next week.
[01:16:51.081 --> 01:16:52.081]  But I'll be here on Monday.
[01:16:53.422 --> 01:16:54.782]  Okay, let's take another call.
[01:16:55.522 --> 01:16:56.482]  Steve in Ohio.
[01:16:56.562 --> 01:16:57.102]  Welcome, sir.
[01:16:57.322 --> 01:16:58.063]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:16:58.243 --> 01:16:58.443]  Good.
[01:16:58.783 --> 01:17:00.543]  I have a technical question to ask you.
[01:17:01.343 --> 01:17:05.785]  Those videos that you produced, I really love the video graphics and the animation.
[01:17:06.285 --> 01:17:08.545]  Was that expensive, and did you have to do that yourself?
[01:17:08.845 --> 01:17:11.806]  How was all of that compiled, especially in your Police State 3 video?
[01:17:11.866 --> 01:17:12.626]  It's just amazing.
[01:17:13.706 --> 01:17:14.907]  Well, I had to pay computer...
[01:17:16.817 --> 01:17:19.960]  Well, I mean, how do you arrange that, though, when you're doing that?
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.203]  Because there's so much stuff that you can't impart everything to them.
[01:17:23.263 --> 01:17:24.564]  I mean, they have to know what to do.
[01:17:24.584 --> 01:17:27.406]  No, I have to sit there and tell them everything to do it.
[01:17:39.597 --> 01:17:40.478]  Oh, that's amazing.
[01:17:40.498 --> 01:17:42.380]  Yeah, I just thought that... I mean, I'm going to be sitting there.
[01:17:42.901 --> 01:17:45.524]  I'm doing a video shoot tonight for some inserts in the film.
[01:17:45.544 --> 01:17:45.924]  Right.
[01:17:45.944 --> 01:17:48.347]  And then I'm going to be... That's at 8 o'clock.
[01:17:48.387 --> 01:17:53.853]  And then at midnight, I'm going to go in and look at another team of two people that's editing and look at the work they've done.
[01:17:53.873 --> 01:17:54.273]  Yeah.
[01:17:54.453 --> 01:17:58.438]  So you actually... It costs a lot of money to have that done, doesn't it?
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:00.521]  Yeah, it costs a lot of money.
[01:18:00.741 --> 01:18:03.804]  We have to sell thousands of videos before I get the money back.
[01:18:04.024 --> 01:18:04.484]  Right, I see.
[01:18:04.544 --> 01:18:05.945]  Okay, one other thing I want to tell you.
[01:18:06.226 --> 01:18:12.791]  That's why I sell them for $5.95 to make $2 a piece, and that's why I let you make copies, because I don't care about money.
[01:18:13.051 --> 01:18:15.974]  Whatever money comes in here, I spend on fighting the New World Order.
[01:18:16.354 --> 01:18:17.915]  Yeah, I give you credit.
[01:18:17.975 --> 01:18:19.196]  I just think it's amazing.
[01:18:19.256 --> 01:18:20.397]  It seems like a lot goes into those.
[01:18:20.417 --> 01:18:28.084]  But also, I was going to tell you, Lou Dobbs, I don't like mainstream too much, but Lou Dobbs has a great report on immigration all the time on his 6 o'clock report.
[01:18:29.068 --> 01:18:29.288]  Yes.
[01:18:29.689 --> 01:18:35.515]  And I'll tape some of those for you, because I've got a lot of those on tape, and they're pretty unbiased about the immigration thing.
[01:18:35.535 --> 01:18:36.656]  They're pretty much against it.
[01:18:36.756 --> 01:18:41.901]  I know, but there is a dangerous stiletto concealed beneath the roads.
[01:18:42.402 --> 01:18:42.702]  Oh, really?
[01:18:42.722 --> 01:18:44.684]  And I'll tell you what they're doing when we get back.
[01:18:44.704 --> 01:18:45.985]  Thanks for the call.
[01:18:46.225 --> 01:18:46.666]  Stay with us.
[01:18:51.684 --> 01:18:52.665]  Hello Ted Anderson.
[01:18:52.725 --> 01:18:57.527]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:18:57.687 --> 01:19:05.491]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:19:05.751 --> 01:19:11.094]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:19:11.294 --> 01:19:13.615]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt...
[01:19:40.345 --> 01:19:43.447]  Gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:19:43.767 --> 01:19:45.409]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:47.630 --> 01:19:49.912]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:52.234 --> 01:19:56.717]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:19:57.077 --> 01:20:01.160]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:02.021]  We listened.
[01:20:02.321 --> 01:20:07.324]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:20:07.584 --> 01:20:08.045]  We listened.
[01:20:08.425 --> 01:20:09.066]  We're good to go.
[01:20:33.303 --> 01:20:37.789]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:20:37.809 --> 01:20:38.429]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:20:38.449 --> 01:20:39.150]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:20:50.615 --> 01:20:53.656]  You and your family members getting enough minerals in the daily diet?
[01:20:54.136 --> 01:20:56.497]  Not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[01:20:56.757 --> 01:21:03.799]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[01:21:04.019 --> 01:21:09.561]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard is more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[01:21:09.921 --> 01:21:17.744]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[01:21:17.984 --> 01:21:18.604]  We're good to go.
[01:21:40.657 --> 01:21:40.957]  877-835-5555 That's 877-835-5555
[01:21:56.095 --> 01:22:01.296]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, Give me liberty or give me death.
[01:22:02.236 --> 01:22:15.419]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution, your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:21.541]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.
[01:22:22.441 --> 01:22:29.705]  To help you grasp the loss of these freedoms, we'll send you absolutely free a one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:22:30.485 --> 01:22:31.005]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:31.025 --> 01:22:31.345]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:31.385 --> 01:22:33.146]  It's absolutely free.
[01:22:33.366 --> 01:22:37.128]  Operators are standing by to assist you.
[01:22:37.168 --> 01:22:37.768]  Just call right now.
[01:22:56.337 --> 01:22:58.259]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:22:58.739 --> 01:23:01.521]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:03.823 --> 01:23:11.910]  The globalists want the knowing people out there to be terrified of them and then to further dumb down and delude the general population.
[01:23:14.432 --> 01:23:21.918]  For the coroner to come out and go, I've had hundreds of calls because we said there were two gunshot wounds to Gary Webb's head.
[01:23:23.052 --> 01:23:24.372]  People saying that's impossible.
[01:23:24.412 --> 01:23:27.233]  Well, it sounds impossible, but it does happen sometimes.
[01:23:27.253 --> 01:23:31.054]  I mean, it's just so ridiculous.
[01:23:33.535 --> 01:23:34.475]  It's ridiculous.
[01:23:35.655 --> 01:23:37.436]  And then you ask, well, how do they get the suicide note?
[01:23:37.456 --> 01:23:39.616]  Well, the assassins will sit you down and go, we're going to kill you.
[01:23:40.056 --> 01:23:42.317]  Write this note saying this, and we won't kill your children.
[01:23:42.877 --> 01:23:43.857]  We won't kill your wife.
[01:23:44.878 --> 01:23:50.599]  And you write the note, or they have somebody write the note, and they go put it on the door, and they pop you a couple times in the head.
[01:23:52.230 --> 01:23:59.574]  You know, they shoot you once and stand over you, and maybe the bullet went the wrong direction, didn't quite hit the brain, you might still live, so they go ahead and give you another pop.
[01:24:00.995 --> 01:24:06.078]  Or they shoot you twice in the head to make it obvious, and then throw it in your face that, oh, this is normal.
[01:24:08.359 --> 01:24:09.820]  Again, I'll never commit suicide.
[01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:18.815]  And they could probably shoot me 45 times in the head and dice me up in little pieces and then bottle me in mayonnaise jars or something.
[01:24:18.835 --> 01:24:28.481]  And then Alex Jones cut himself up in little pieces, put himself in a mayonnaise jar, and then delivered himself to the moon before he, again, went and worked for Santa Claus and then the Tooth Fairy.
[01:24:30.722 --> 01:24:31.743]  It's unbelievable.
[01:24:31.763 --> 01:24:34.364]  They just do this on purpose, and I just can't get over it.
[01:24:35.885 --> 01:24:37.306]  I have a lot of trouble getting over it.
[01:24:39.642 --> 01:24:45.526]  In fact, I don't want to make a sick joke out of this, but it'd be like saying this woman cut out her own baby.
[01:24:46.427 --> 01:24:49.088]  And that's how ridiculous this is, how sick this is.
[01:24:49.369 --> 01:24:53.551]  Just a horrible story, and my thoughts and prayers, I hope your prayers go out to the family.
[01:24:55.353 --> 01:24:56.293]  Just so horrible.
[01:24:56.473 --> 01:24:58.054]  I mean, just pray for these people.
[01:24:59.095 --> 01:25:06.080]  This is Amber Alert issued for missing fetus, a 23-year-old woman.
[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:13.665]  Who was eight months pregnant was killed yesterday, and the fetus was taken from her body, authorities said.
[01:25:13.725 --> 01:25:20.671]  Sheriff's deputies were investigating the afternoon killing of a woman, and they were searching for the baby who they believed could have survived.
[01:25:22.629 --> 01:25:27.971]  Notoway County Sheriff's Ben Epsby said somebody was wanting a baby awfully bad.
[01:25:27.991 --> 01:25:30.912]  The sheriff's issued an Amber Alert for the missing fetus.
[01:25:30.952 --> 01:25:33.913]  Police are searching for an 8-month-old Caucasian female fetus.
[01:25:34.654 --> 01:25:44.337]  It also suggested that things to look for in the case, including bloody clothing or towels, possible health issues with the fetus, and a freshly cut umbilical cord.
[01:25:47.118 --> 01:25:48.259]  And this is out of...
[01:25:51.633 --> 01:25:54.114]  Skidmore MO.
[01:25:54.534 --> 01:25:56.736]  Is that Missouri or Montana?
[01:25:56.856 --> 01:25:57.516]  I'm brain dead.
[01:25:57.916 --> 01:25:58.676]  What is MO?
[01:25:59.817 --> 01:26:00.257]  Missouri.
[01:26:00.277 --> 01:26:00.958]  That's what I thought.
[01:26:02.118 --> 01:26:05.640]  Hey, we've got an affiliate there in Kansas City and a couple other stations around that state.
[01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:10.102]  Man, I hope people are looking for whoever this demon is.
[01:26:12.492 --> 01:26:20.535]  Bobby Joe Stinnett was killed at about 3 p.m., and the unborn child was removed from her body by the person or persons who committed the crime.
[01:26:21.135 --> 01:26:30.177]  Stinnett's mother found her strangled to death inside her home, who called police at 3.38 p.m., Kansas City, Missouri.
[01:26:30.197 --> 01:26:31.398]  Yeah, it was Kansas City, Missouri.
[01:26:32.798 --> 01:26:33.398]  Just horrible.
[01:26:33.438 --> 01:26:39.260]  TV station KMBC reported paramedics tried to revive her, but she was later pronounced dead at St.
[01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:41.241]  Francis Hospital in Maryville, Missouri.
[01:26:42.822 --> 01:26:44.903]  And I'm surprised the police haven't blamed her for it.
[01:26:44.923 --> 01:26:49.324]  I mean, they say that Gary Webb shot himself twice in the head.
[01:26:52.425 --> 01:26:56.306]  Again, she was obviously, somebody murdered her and stole the child.
[01:26:57.706 --> 01:27:01.027]  But if the government had done this, again, they'd probably blame it on her.
[01:27:01.767 --> 01:27:02.808]  I'm not even joking, folks.
[01:27:02.828 --> 01:27:04.248]  This is what they do with Gary Webb.
[01:27:04.848 --> 01:27:08.629]  And by the way, people get so angry about this, and they should.
[01:27:08.669 --> 01:27:09.489]  This is disgusting.
[01:27:09.509 --> 01:27:10.310]  It hurts my heart.
[01:27:11.290 --> 01:27:11.450]  But
[01:27:12.529 --> 01:27:15.790]  They don't care about abortion of eight-month-old babies.
[01:27:15.850 --> 01:27:22.011]  I mean, even Dick Gephardt wanted to ban partial birth abortion, and then Bush crafted a bill that didn't even do that.
[01:27:22.971 --> 01:27:26.251]  With loopholes, you could fly a 747 through.
[01:27:28.332 --> 01:27:36.693]  And her husband, she survived by her husband, and so they were looking forward to the baby and being a family.
[01:27:37.753 --> 01:27:40.694]  Oh, my heart goes out to this lady, this poor dear lady.
[01:27:40.734 --> 01:27:41.554]  God bless her.
[01:27:43.058 --> 01:27:44.818]  People cannot face up to evil.
[01:27:45.479 --> 01:27:46.739]  Think of a slime bag.
[01:27:47.199 --> 01:27:47.839]  The demon.
[01:27:48.479 --> 01:27:49.900]  The pit of hell dweller.
[01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:56.161]  There is a hell, folks, who would go in and strangle a woman and then cut the baby out of her.
[01:28:00.902 --> 01:28:02.462]  Cut the baby out of her.
[01:28:02.502 --> 01:28:03.523]  This is horrible.
[01:28:03.643 --> 01:28:05.363]  And I don't like talking about stuff like this.
[01:28:05.403 --> 01:28:07.483]  I mean, this is right out of Helter Skelter.
[01:28:08.824 --> 01:28:09.704]  Charlie Manson.
[01:28:11.863 --> 01:28:16.085]  And it's either some completely psychopathic individual who didn't want a baby.
[01:28:16.185 --> 01:28:17.465]  It's probably devil worshippers.
[01:28:19.966 --> 01:28:22.907]  And... Oh, heaven help us.
[01:28:23.007 --> 01:28:24.428]  Just pray for this woman's family.
[01:28:24.448 --> 01:28:26.928]  This is so horrible.
[01:28:29.569 --> 01:28:30.930]  Oh, suffer the little children.
[01:28:31.530 --> 01:28:32.650]  How has it gotten this bad?
[01:28:34.231 --> 01:28:34.871]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:34.891 --> 01:28:35.271]  Stay with us.
[01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:42.881]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.361 --> 01:28:44.962]  The empire's on the run.

[01:30:51.758 --> 01:30:52.238]  Hi, folks.
[01:30:52.278 --> 01:30:53.279]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:30:53.339 --> 01:30:55.741]  Whether you were aware or not, World War III has started.
[01:30:56.081 --> 01:30:56.962]  Let me rephrase that.
[01:30:57.342 --> 01:30:58.563]  Oil War III has started.
[01:30:58.883 --> 01:30:59.684]  Don't kid yourself.
[01:30:59.704 --> 01:31:01.325]  The reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[01:31:01.706 --> 01:31:05.108]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[01:31:05.549 --> 01:31:06.369]  Why else would the U.S.
[01:31:06.409 --> 01:31:09.371]  be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[01:31:09.632 --> 01:31:10.913]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[01:31:11.333 --> 01:31:15.836]  The nations of the earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[01:31:16.237 --> 01:31:20.220]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:26.623]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.
[01:31:26.904 --> 01:31:32.987]  Call Ready Reserves at 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the free booklet and what you can do to prepare.
[01:31:33.507 --> 01:31:34.108]  That's 800-453-2202.
[01:31:34.128 --> 01:31:39.751]  After you read the booklet, you will understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[01:31:40.191 --> 01:31:42.112]  That's 1-800-453-2202 or email your request to ReadyReserves at AOL.com.
[01:31:42.132 --> 01:31:42.452]  That's 800-453-2202.
[01:32:03.841 --> 01:32:11.525]  I have no problem for an Amber Alert system that truly goes after vicious criminals.
[01:32:12.286 --> 01:32:19.249]  But we already had an Amber Alert system, and that was called radio and TV and print reporting on crimes as they happen.
[01:32:20.630 --> 01:32:26.153]  And in Kansas City, where we have an affiliate, KCXL, a demon of hell...
[01:32:27.162 --> 01:32:34.567]  Or demons, probably multiple people, strangled a woman in her home at 3 o'clock yesterday and cut the 8-month-old baby out of her.
[01:32:34.607 --> 01:32:36.708]  The police believe the baby is still alive.
[01:32:36.728 --> 01:32:43.452]  Look for people with an infant that's sick or has some medical problems, bloody rags, things of this nature.
[01:32:43.953 --> 01:32:52.138]  Just have your eyes peeled all over that state and other states, and it's just absolutely heart-rending.
[01:32:53.007 --> 01:32:54.690]  That they would murder this young mother.
[01:32:55.010 --> 01:32:56.773]  And imagine the father coming home to this.
[01:32:57.875 --> 01:32:59.698]  It just makes me sick.
[01:33:00.279 --> 01:33:03.405]  We have a responsibility to get the word out on this.
[01:33:03.565 --> 01:33:06.490]  And so please, please keep your eyes open.
[01:33:08.231 --> 01:33:11.033]  All right, I digress there for a second into that issue.
[01:33:32.429 --> 01:33:32.990]  We're good to go.
[01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:57.411]  He's the guy that said Bush isn't just above international law, which is bad enough.
[01:33:57.451 --> 01:33:59.693]  We're signatories to the Geneva Convention and others.
[01:34:15.179 --> 01:34:18.503]  And then when our troops get captured, this will happen to them, and how can we complain?
[01:34:18.984 --> 01:34:28.595]  But also, Alberto Gonzalez, and I have a congressman on, we've read the memos, this was eight, nine months ago, on air, says Bush is above federal law.
[01:34:29.356 --> 01:34:34.162]  And now, two weeks ago, federal prosecutors argued and the court agreed, they can torture you.
[01:34:35.612 --> 01:34:37.513]  And then use that as evidence in court.
[01:34:37.613 --> 01:34:40.415]  Not even the Nazis would torture you and then use it in court.
[01:34:40.495 --> 01:34:41.296]  They knew to hide it.
[01:34:41.756 --> 01:34:45.538]  So we're kind of trekking into new territory of evil here.
[01:34:46.179 --> 01:34:55.745]  And joining us is retired Admiral John Hudson, now dean and president of the Franklin Pierce Law Center in Concord, New Hampshire.
[01:34:56.665 --> 01:35:01.748]  And it says Hudson and others are opposing Bush's nomination for Alberto a la Torture Gonzales.
[01:35:02.168 --> 01:35:04.390]  Admiral, it is a real honor to have you on with us.
[01:35:05.109 --> 01:35:05.669]  Thank you.
[01:35:05.829 --> 01:35:12.431]  It's a pleasure to be here, although it's unfortunate that we are even having to have these sorts of conversations.
[01:35:12.511 --> 01:35:14.631]  But thank you for giving me the opportunity.
[01:35:14.871 --> 01:35:15.411]  Well, you bet.
[01:35:15.491 --> 01:35:17.672]  I mean, I'm considered a paleo-conservative.
[01:35:17.732 --> 01:35:20.112]  I'm not some liberal who doesn't like Bush.
[01:35:20.152 --> 01:35:25.533]  But Bush is really appointing a lot of either people who aren't fit or who are despots.
[01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:27.794]  And tell us about...
[01:35:28.683 --> 01:35:35.288]  Yourself and why you're doing this, why others are doing this, and some of the ideas you have, and why you want to block Alberto Gonzalez.
[01:35:36.489 --> 01:35:44.516]  Well, you know, I spent 28 years in the Navy and retired as the Judge Advocate General of the Navy.
[01:35:44.576 --> 01:35:57.286]  And during that period of time and as the Dean of a law school, I feel very strongly that it is critically important for the United States to adhere to and promote the rule of law.
[01:35:58.515 --> 01:36:04.720]  If we don't do that, if we don't promote the rule of law, we will have lost the war on terror.
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:10.464]  Because the bad guys will have done to us what they wanted to do to us anyway.
[01:36:11.384 --> 01:36:21.331]  Therefore, I think that it is absolutely necessary that we have people in place who will do whatever is necessary in order to ensure security.
[01:36:22.346 --> 01:36:36.839]  We continue to support the rule of law, and I don't think that Judge Gonzales, in the areas in which I am familiar, at least, with regards to the Geneva Conventions and the War on Terror, has done that in an adequate way.
[01:36:37.399 --> 01:36:43.625]  Indeed, to the contrary, he's sort of thrown the rule of law over the side, it seems to me.
[01:36:45.103 --> 01:36:51.586]  Now, your bio is encyclopedic, but you were a JAG officer?
[01:36:52.046 --> 01:36:53.347]  Yes, sir.
[01:36:53.387 --> 01:36:54.608]  Tell us about your position there.
[01:36:54.628 --> 01:37:04.132]  I mean, just because you have the expertise to understand the rule of law, for folks out there, just tell us a little bit about yourself and about some of your colleagues that are moving to try to block this monster.
[01:37:04.552 --> 01:37:05.853]  Sure.
[01:37:06.033 --> 01:37:09.475]  You know, as the Judge Evan General of the Navy, you're responsible for
[01:37:10.431 --> 01:37:32.019]  ... ensuring that the Navy lawyers throughout the world and the Marine Corps assist the United States in every way they can in complying with the rules that are laid out that we all try to adhere to, both domestically and internationally.
[01:37:32.179 --> 01:37:36.580]  Because it's not really a rule of law if you only apply it when it's convenient.
[01:37:37.841 --> 01:37:38.961]  It may be something else,
[01:37:39.497 --> 01:37:39.757]  I think so.
[01:37:56.212 --> 01:38:10.920]  Judge Gonzales, in January of 2002, authored a memo to the president in which he said that the Geneva Conventions were quaint and obsolete.
[01:38:12.121 --> 01:38:21.586]  And he went on to say that we really don't want the Geneva Conventions to apply because if they do, it will inhibit the war on terror.
[01:38:23.027 --> 01:38:24.368]  To me, that's a very
[01:38:25.231 --> 01:38:25.831]  That's right.
[01:38:25.851 --> 01:38:30.092]  There have been memos that put forth that opinion, that
[01:38:52.967 --> 01:39:02.634]  There was a memo that said that as Commander-in-Chief, he didn't have to comply with certain laws in his execution of the war on terror.
[01:39:04.155 --> 01:39:06.137]  But we are a nation of laws.
[01:39:06.377 --> 01:39:07.298]  That's our heritage.
[01:39:07.538 --> 01:39:16.845]  And for decades and decades, the United States has justifiably and honorably held itself out
[01:39:20.623 --> 01:39:28.588]  Well, doesn't that extrapolate out to barbecuing children on the front lawn?
[01:39:28.648 --> 01:39:32.571]  I mean, if I'm above the law, and I'm the president, I mean, I...
[01:39:33.411 --> 01:39:34.531]  I'm your sovereign.
[01:39:34.751 --> 01:39:36.212]  The law flows from me.
[01:39:36.732 --> 01:39:45.674]  That's diametrically opposed to the Magna Carta of 1214 or the Declaration of Independence of 1776 or the ratified Constitution of the several states.
[01:39:46.974 --> 01:39:50.135]  I mean, this is 180 from what America is.
[01:39:50.315 --> 01:39:53.776]  We're not America anymore if we do not have this basic code.
[01:39:54.176 --> 01:39:59.897]  I think that changing those kinds of fundamental understandings about
[01:40:01.851 --> 01:40:16.023]  Adherence to the basic rules that we have all adhered to over the years does fundamentally change the United States in a way that I think probably most Americans don't want it changed.
[01:40:16.104 --> 01:40:18.906]  Because the rules are there to protect all of us.
[01:40:18.946 --> 01:40:20.447]  They're not there to inhibit us.
[01:40:20.527 --> 01:40:22.509]  They're there to protect us.
[01:40:23.970 --> 01:40:28.234]  And the Geneva Conventions, for example, are there not to protect us,
[01:40:30.965 --> 01:40:35.769]  Originally, we're not conceived as being there to protect the enemy from U.S.
[01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:36.810]  troops.
[01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:39.633]  They were to protect, in our concept, the U.S.
[01:40:39.653 --> 01:40:40.634]  troops from the enemy.
[01:40:41.154 --> 01:40:54.607]  So we've made some sort of fundamental changes to our understanding of how the rules should apply and the reasons they apply and the reasons the United States should be advocating on behalf of them
[01:40:55.279 --> 01:40:59.701]  In a way that I think is not helpful to the United States.
[01:41:00.701 --> 01:41:04.743]  All right, we're talking to former Judge Advocate General, is that correct?
[01:41:05.003 --> 01:41:06.243]  Yeah, that's right, absolutely correct.
[01:41:06.343 --> 01:41:07.684]  Yeah, John Hudson.
[01:41:08.144 --> 01:41:18.648]  And so really the head of the Navy's legal arm and an expert on the law, and we're so honored again to have you on, sir.
[01:41:19.628 --> 01:41:21.229]  Look, I mean, it's common sense to me.
[01:41:21.929 --> 01:41:27.252]  And I'm no former judge advocate general of the Navy, but I've read the Constitutional Bill of Rights.
[01:41:27.432 --> 01:41:33.735]  I know that in Vietnam, you know, those dirty North Viet Cong, those regulars, they're torturing our airmen.
[01:41:33.755 --> 01:41:36.797]  They're making them give false confessions.
[01:41:37.137 --> 01:41:38.177]  They're the scum of the earth.
[01:41:38.237 --> 01:41:40.518]  Ooh, Joseph Mingala, he tortures people.
[01:41:41.379 --> 01:41:51.344]  The Inquisition, I mean, it's just the bedrock that torture and all of this is bad, and the president and the government has to adhere to the law to an even higher standard than the people.
[01:41:52.224 --> 01:41:55.766]  And now we have the White House saying, no, we're above all that.
[01:41:55.806 --> 01:41:58.307]  I mean, I can't think really of anything more terrifying.
[01:41:58.707 --> 01:42:00.128]  Really, nobody's above the law.
[01:42:00.608 --> 01:42:09.452]  And if you permit anybody to be above the law, you head down a slippery slope that none of us wants to peer over.
[01:42:10.933 --> 01:42:11.433]  And you're right.
[01:42:11.473 --> 01:42:19.177]  Throughout the years, throughout the wars, World War II, Vietnam, the first Iraq war,
[01:42:20.338 --> 01:42:30.045]  We very scrupulously adhered to the Geneva Conventions and tried as best we could to enforce them.
[01:42:30.425 --> 01:42:34.548]  That does not mean, on the other hand, that the enemy is always going to do that.
[01:42:35.569 --> 01:42:42.093]  The problem is, however, if we're no better than the enemy, what's the point of fighting the war?
[01:42:43.714 --> 01:42:48.097]  If we give up our soul, if we give up our heritage in order to preserve it,
[01:42:48.797 --> 01:42:50.118]  What's the point of fighting?
[01:42:50.178 --> 01:42:53.240]  We might as well just give it up and save all the bloodshed.
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:43:08.048]  So that's the concern, I think, that a lot of people have about the direction that the administration is taking, at least with regard to the Geneva Conventions and the rule of law.
[01:43:09.278 --> 01:43:20.367]  Again, we're talking to former Judge Advocate General of the Navy, John Hudson, and retired Rear Admiral and now Dean and President of the Franklin Pierce Law Center in Concord, New Hampshire.
[01:43:21.368 --> 01:43:27.513]  And the reports are saying that you and others are moving, trying to formulate something to block Gonzalez.
[01:43:28.494 --> 01:43:30.436]  Well, you know, it's kind of funny that you should say that, that...
[01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:57.351]  You know, as I said, I spent 28 years in the Navy, and I'm the dean of a law school.
[01:43:57.551 --> 01:43:59.752]  I kind of think of myself as the establishment.
[01:44:00.153 --> 01:44:04.455]  Well, I mean, most of the Republicans, Congress.
[01:44:04.655 --> 01:44:07.236]  I understand completely, and I take your point.
[01:44:07.256 --> 01:44:19.122]  I think that the interesting thing about it is that issues like this are issues where Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, come together.
[01:44:19.462 --> 01:44:20.523]  I'm a registered Republican.
[01:44:21.354 --> 01:44:23.195]  Yeah, I've been a Republican my whole life.
[01:44:25.517 --> 01:44:37.485]  I think being a Republican myself, I think being a Republican means adhering to laws and honoring your international obligations and promoting human rights and all those kinds of things.
[01:44:38.045 --> 01:44:41.627]  That, to me, is a very Republican point of view.
[01:44:43.108 --> 01:44:47.811]  Undermining those kinds of things isn't Republican or Democrat.
[01:44:47.851 --> 01:44:49.833]  It's just something out there that...
[01:44:50.825 --> 01:44:56.308]  Happens in other countries, but you don't like to see it happen in the United States.
[01:44:56.548 --> 01:45:00.570]  Well, that was certainly eloquently said, but why don't you spell it out?
[01:45:00.630 --> 01:45:07.493]  Is it the D word or the T word, or is it a combination of despotism and tyranny you're talking about?
[01:45:08.694 --> 01:45:16.658]  Well, I'm not going to buy into your characterization of it, although I think that it raises specters that...
[01:45:18.579 --> 01:45:21.320]  None of us like to think about it.
[01:45:21.340 --> 01:45:22.300]  I mean, we had an election.
[01:45:23.721 --> 01:45:27.782]  The current administration won rather handily.
[01:45:28.862 --> 01:45:33.363]  But that doesn't mean that people shouldn't speak out.
[01:45:33.843 --> 01:45:43.066]  The great strength of America, I think, has always been our ability and our willingness to speak out.
[01:45:43.286 --> 01:45:43.486]  And if
[01:45:44.096 --> 01:45:45.278]  People feel inhibited.
[01:45:45.338 --> 01:45:52.272]  If people come to believe that it's somehow in some kind of way unpatriotic to voice their opinions...
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:58.243]  That would be a terrible, terrible loss for the United States.
[01:46:23.295 --> 01:46:29.438]  Well, and that's why I raised it, because I know there are concerns about it.
[01:46:29.518 --> 01:46:38.642]  And that's part of the problem that we have with some of the nominations and confirmations, I think, is that it shouldn't take courage to speak out.
[01:46:38.663 --> 01:46:51.789]  You know, it shouldn't be something that you have to worry about to speak out in thoughtful, respectful opposition to various actions that your government may take.
[01:46:51.809 --> 01:46:51.969]  You know,
[01:46:53.533 --> 01:47:00.115]  The loyal opposition fills a very, very important role in our government.
[01:47:00.335 --> 01:47:19.021]  And if the loyal opposition steps back from their responsibility and lets the government in power, at this point the Republicans, the present administration, just have their way,
[01:47:20.228 --> 01:47:21.970]  There's no checks and balance.
[01:47:22.030 --> 01:47:26.736]  It's not a system that the United States and Americans are familiar with.
[01:47:27.417 --> 01:47:28.077]  Well, sir...
[01:47:29.085 --> 01:47:35.450]  Again, we have the former Judge Advocate General of the Navy on with us, a dean of a major law school on the East Coast up in New Hampshire.
[01:47:36.651 --> 01:47:38.173]  I've got just a few other questions for you.
[01:47:38.193 --> 01:47:39.013]  We're about to go to break.
[01:47:39.033 --> 01:47:40.575]  I hope we can keep you through a short break.
[01:47:41.435 --> 01:47:42.296]  But I've got to get this out.
[01:47:42.736 --> 01:47:55.507]  It sounded like a few minutes ago you were alluding to something that's very central to my heart and to jurisprudence and what America is supposed to be, the United States, that just because Bush won the election doesn't mean he has a mandate to destroy the Bill of Rights.
[01:47:55.807 --> 01:47:56.628]  In a republic...
[01:47:58.115 --> 01:48:06.679]  The minority is protected as well as the majority, and Bush kind of going, it's a democracy, and now you elected me, so I'm above the law.
[01:48:06.699 --> 01:48:07.399]  Can you speak to that?
[01:48:07.979 --> 01:48:09.640]  Well, it's an interesting point.
[01:48:09.660 --> 01:48:13.642]  You know, we heard, you talked about, you know, kinds of words.
[01:48:13.682 --> 01:48:17.683]  We heard the M word very much after the election, the mandate word.
[01:48:18.644 --> 01:48:23.566]  You know, one person's mandate is another person's tyranny, I think, and you
[01:48:25.346 --> 01:48:31.370]  I think that when you win an election, there are certain things, rights that come along with that.
[01:48:31.690 --> 01:48:41.016]  But those rights, as you very eloquently point out, are tempered by the rights of the minority.
[01:48:41.817 --> 01:48:50.022]  And we can't let the majority trample on those rights.
[01:48:50.302 --> 01:48:53.244]  But it can happen if
[01:48:53.629 --> 01:48:53.789]  Yeah.
[01:49:13.729 --> 01:49:14.069]  I think so.
[01:49:32.196 --> 01:49:35.018]  We need to exercise that whenever we have the opportunity.
[01:49:35.298 --> 01:49:38.140]  All right, Admiral, we've got to break.
[01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:42.743]  John Hudson, a retired Rear Admiral, a former Judge Advocate General of the Navy.
[01:49:43.103 --> 01:49:45.345]  We'll come back and talk about how we stopped Gonzales.
[01:49:45.865 --> 01:49:46.386]  Stay with us.
[01:49:48.999 --> 01:49:52.180]  We're good to go.
[01:50:08.345 --> 01:50:12.546]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:12.606 --> 01:50:19.548]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:19.668 --> 01:50:21.748]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:22.048 --> 01:50:32.390]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:32.671 --> 01:50:34.791]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is...
[01:50:35.011 --> 01:50:38.072]  Then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:51:23.493 --> 01:51:28.995]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:29.215 --> 01:51:36.158]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a nightlight or camp light.

[01:51:58.137 --> 01:52:00.398]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[01:52:11.783 --> 01:52:18.546]  We have homeopathic detox solutions for contrails, radiation, MSG, and aspartame poisoning to name a few.
[01:52:18.826 --> 01:52:19.446]  We're good to go.
[01:52:51.912 --> 01:52:54.113]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:52:54.673 --> 01:52:57.534]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:52:58.995 --> 01:53:06.697]  All right, we've just got about three minutes left with a retired admiral, former judge, advocate general of the Navy, Marine Corps, the whole nine yards.
[01:53:07.658 --> 01:53:08.738]  Just wonderful to have him on.
[01:53:08.758 --> 01:53:12.200]  We've had on so many senators and congressmen and others, but this is great.
[01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:15.021]  And he's a conservative, and I commend him for what he's doing.
[01:53:15.041 --> 01:53:18.742]  I mean, to have the man who'll be the chief lawyer, the chief law enforcement officer, going...
[01:53:19.002 --> 01:53:20.042]  We're above the law!
[01:53:20.102 --> 01:53:20.662]  Torture!
[01:53:20.962 --> 01:53:21.563]  Yippee!
[01:53:21.943 --> 01:53:22.743]  It's wonderful!
[01:53:22.843 --> 01:53:23.743]  Bush is God!
[01:53:23.763 --> 01:53:26.423]  I mean, that's got a lot of conservatives worried.
[01:53:26.444 --> 01:53:27.764]  Oh, and don't worry.
[01:53:27.824 --> 01:53:31.464]  Later we'll get Democrats in, and we'll have these precedents set for all of this.
[01:53:31.525 --> 01:53:33.345]  Imagine a Bill Clinton type with all these powers.
[01:53:33.725 --> 01:53:34.865]  Same thing with the Patriot Acts.
[01:53:35.765 --> 01:53:39.706]  Admiral, just in a nutshell, why are you so concerned about Gonzalez?
[01:53:40.046 --> 01:53:40.786]  How do we stop him?
[01:53:40.826 --> 01:53:43.787]  I mean, you talked in the break, we talked about the brazenness of all this.
[01:53:44.764 --> 01:53:51.750]  Well, I'm concerned because I don't think he represents the best of America, the ideal, the aspirations of America.
[01:53:51.770 --> 01:53:59.716]  I think he represents the kind of dark underbelly that we don't want to predict.
[01:53:59.736 --> 01:54:01.017]  I was about to say the dark side.
[01:54:01.237 --> 01:54:03.299]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:54:03.919 --> 01:54:10.404]  So, you know, we're somewhat limited, I suppose, in the tools that we have.
[01:54:10.464 --> 01:54:11.946]  I mean, you know, talking to...
[01:54:13.912 --> 01:54:22.877]  Talking to reporters and to talk show people and trying to write op-ed pieces, climbing on the roof and baying at the moon.
[01:54:23.377 --> 01:54:27.619]  All of those things, I think, tend to create a momentum.
[01:54:28.319 --> 01:54:36.303]  The confirmation hearing is going to be pretty soon, so over the holidays, momentum tends to slow down in the holidays.
[01:54:36.363 --> 01:54:38.924]  But I think that...
[01:54:40.042 --> 01:54:41.083]  People need to sit up.
[01:54:41.183 --> 01:54:45.684]  Americans need to sit up and kind of open their eyes real wide and say, hey, wait a minute.
[01:54:46.305 --> 01:54:52.627]  This ain't the kind of guy that I want to be the chief law enforcement officer of the United States of America, by the way.
[01:54:54.548 --> 01:55:06.552]  And then let their senators, and particularly the people on the Judiciary Committee, know that they're displeased about this, and they want the hard questions asked.
[01:55:06.572 --> 01:55:06.632]  And
[01:55:10.368 --> 01:55:34.510]  Ensure that the United States Senate and the Judiciary Committee fully and fairly and completely exercise their constitutional responsibility to inquire into this in their advice and consent role, and not just abdicate that responsibility because it's the first confirmation hearing and, you know...
[01:55:35.328 --> 01:55:37.870]  There's the mandate and blah, blah, blah.
[01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:40.691]  This is an important position.
[01:55:41.392 --> 01:55:47.375]  We need to make sure that we have the right person in it and somebody that will represent us.
[01:55:47.576 --> 01:55:50.777]  Well, sir, we also have this partisanship like it's a football game.
[01:55:51.098 --> 01:55:53.379]  I know conservatives will go, I don't care if he's pro-abort.
[01:55:53.599 --> 01:55:54.780]  I don't care if he's for open borders.
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:55.861]  I don't care if he's for torture.
[01:55:56.061 --> 01:55:57.642]  We can't let the Democrats win.
[01:55:57.942 --> 01:55:59.483]  I mean, that is just mindless.
[01:56:00.083 --> 01:56:01.384]  Well, it's not the Democrats winning.
[01:56:01.444 --> 01:56:03.225]  It's the Americans winning.
[01:56:04.175 --> 01:56:04.696]  Exactly.
[01:56:05.156 --> 01:56:10.319]  And at some point, you have to put partisan politics aside.
[01:56:11.359 --> 01:56:13.321]  Yeah, there's plenty of good people for this position.
[01:56:13.521 --> 01:56:17.483]  Admiral, folks can check out the website there at the law school.
[01:56:17.543 --> 01:56:19.324]  Tell us that website, please.
[01:56:19.964 --> 01:56:22.566]  The website is PierceLaw.edu.
[01:56:22.626 --> 01:56:25.888]  If you want to go to law school and find out about law school, it's a great place to look.

[01:56:33.156 --> 01:56:41.399]  Or type in Admiral John Hudson, H-U-T-S-O-N, into a search engine, read some of the articles and material that's out there, and it's also on infowars.com.
[01:56:41.759 --> 01:56:44.160]  Admiral, thanks for all the time, your busy schedule.
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:45.240]  Have a great holiday.
[01:56:45.921 --> 01:56:46.341]  You too.
[01:56:46.401 --> 01:56:47.801]  Thank you very much for the opportunity.
[01:56:48.021 --> 01:56:48.602]  Take care, sir.
[01:56:48.862 --> 01:56:49.142]  Bye, sir.

[01:57:36.902 --> 01:57:37.943]  Third hour coming up.
[01:57:38.523 --> 01:57:39.504]  More news, more info.
[01:57:48.035 --> 01:57:48.675]  Big Brother.
[01:57:49.335 --> 01:57:50.356]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:51.096 --> 01:57:52.177]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:52.857 --> 01:57:53.657]  You want answers?
[01:57:54.437 --> 01:57:55.358]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:55.998 --> 01:57:59.659]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.179 --> 01:58:04.281]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.222 --> 01:58:11.384]  All right, now we are going to get to all the callers that have been holding in the last hour.
[01:58:11.604 --> 01:58:14.965]  I had the former Judge Advocate General, a Republican...
[01:58:15.743 --> 01:58:20.910]  Head of the Navy's entire law system and the Marine Corps on in the last hour.
[01:58:22.192 --> 01:58:29.982]  Talking about opposing Alberto, I love torture, Gonzalez, who says the White House is above the law, above federal law, above any law, can torture whoever they want, do whatever they want.
[01:58:31.147 --> 01:58:41.450]  And an hour before that, we had one of the stars, the lone gunman in X-Files on, saying, yeah, he thinks the government was behind 9-11 and getting into that episode where they fly the hijacked jet in the building.
[01:58:41.870 --> 01:58:46.812]  This is the type of stuff you miss when you don't tune in to the whole broadcast.
[01:58:47.232 --> 01:58:48.713]  Or when stations don't carry it all.
[01:58:49.753 --> 01:58:52.134]  Just sponsor the stations, call them, thank them.
[01:58:52.554 --> 01:58:55.616]  Get us on more hours, folks, because I can't stand people missing it.
[01:58:56.276 --> 01:58:58.898]  It will be rebroadcast tonight, 9 to midnight.
[01:58:58.918 --> 01:59:03.060]  You'll be able to hear those two interviews in the first and second hours, so be sure and tune in if you missed it.
[01:59:03.420 --> 01:59:08.062]  I know we've got Ken and Brian and Sherry and Mike and everybody else patiently holding 1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:08.082 --> 01:59:09.643]  Bush to sign the new super patriot police state bill.
[01:59:15.638 --> 01:59:16.858]  In a celebration tonight.
[01:59:16.898 --> 01:59:19.559]  I mean, it's getting really... They've got to celebrate destroying our freedom.
[01:59:20.179 --> 01:59:21.220]  Got a bunch of other news.
[01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:23.940]  Christians being arrested en masse for their political speech.
[01:59:24.841 --> 01:59:27.541]  Just all types of stuff going on as we go down the tubes here.
[01:59:27.561 --> 01:59:30.182]  But at least we're talking about it and trying to fight it as best we can.
[01:59:31.363 --> 01:59:32.203]  So that's all coming up.
[01:59:32.863 --> 01:59:34.343]  Ken in Kansas.
[01:59:34.383 --> 01:59:34.984]  Go ahead, Ken.
[01:59:35.004 --> 01:59:37.484]  Yeah, Ken from Kansas.
[01:59:37.704 --> 01:59:43.226]  A number of things I wanted to run by you, but I want to emphasize on one main thing.
[01:59:44.986 --> 01:59:47.447]  Show on the History Channel the other night.
[01:59:47.867 --> 01:59:51.988]  It's kind of a mixed bag on the Oklahoma City cover-up.
[01:59:53.928 --> 01:59:55.169]  Did you see it or hear about it?
[01:59:55.309 --> 01:59:55.849]  No, I didn't.
[01:59:55.889 --> 01:59:56.849]  Do you have a copy?
[01:59:57.129 --> 01:59:57.489]  Yeah.
[01:59:57.969 --> 01:59:58.790]  Will you mail me a copy?
[01:59:59.030 --> 02:00:00.170]  Yeah, I can get it to you.
[02:00:00.190 --> 02:00:01.490]  Pretty please sugar on top?
[02:00:02.010 --> 02:00:05.451]  Yeah, it'll be about a week before I can dub it and get it to you.
[02:00:05.471 --> 02:00:05.731]  But what...
[02:00:09.249 --> 02:00:14.772]  What it was, was they brought out that there was an ATF tip about the blast.
[02:00:15.393 --> 02:00:17.894]  That witness was not allowed to testify.
[02:00:17.934 --> 02:00:22.517]  They brought out about all the multiple witnesses that saw the multiple people get out of the truck.
[02:00:23.977 --> 02:00:27.380]  And the excuse they use for not allowing them to testify.
[02:00:27.620 --> 02:00:38.169]  Did you hear me two years ago when I predicted they would bring it all out but then claim it was Arabs independently and not tell you that the Arabs were actually CIA and were protected?
[02:00:38.269 --> 02:00:39.731]  Or did they say it was white supremacists?
[02:00:40.410 --> 02:00:41.750]  Well, I was getting to that.
[02:00:42.190 --> 02:00:48.272]  So now, domestically, it's the evil right-wingers, and anybody who talks about freedom is secretly a white supremacist.
[02:00:48.292 --> 02:00:55.153]  They brought out all that, and they didn't say anything about the bombs against the columns, or anything about what General Parton said.
[02:00:55.173 --> 02:00:59.514]  Yeah, I saw them setting this up a long time ago, to then bring this out later, but go ahead.
[02:00:59.954 --> 02:01:05.595]  And the conclusion was that there were some USA patriot, Arab patriots,
[02:01:06.710 --> 02:01:14.834]  I don't know if you were listening two years ago, and I saw what they would do from just indicators.
[02:01:15.174 --> 02:01:24.458]  I said they'll claim the right wing works with Arab terrorists as the nexus point to start sending the police and military after people who are non-Arab.
[02:01:24.478 --> 02:01:26.739]  Did you hear me over?
[02:01:27.573 --> 02:01:33.885]  I think you were predicting that, but that was the exact thing they had on history.
[02:01:33.905 --> 02:01:38.876]  Don't tell me what I want to hear, though, because I know I said it 50 times, but I'm curious, did you hear me say that?
[02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:40.541]  I believe I did.
[02:01:40.841 --> 02:01:44.525]  Over and over again, if we had a big enough staff, we'd go pull that tape.
[02:01:44.685 --> 02:01:46.407]  The tapes, I mean, it was years ago.
[02:01:46.707 --> 02:01:47.608]  We'd play those here.
[02:01:47.988 --> 02:01:49.129]  How do I do this?
[02:01:49.570 --> 02:01:51.672]  Because I know their game plan, folks.
[02:01:52.112 --> 02:01:54.594]  And once you know their game plan, it's as easy as one, two, three.
[02:01:54.855 --> 02:01:55.735]  I'm not bragging.
[02:01:55.795 --> 02:01:57.998]  I'm saying people better listen to what I'm saying.
[02:01:58.818 --> 02:01:59.979]  Well, it was clear.
[02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:03.162]  It was the people over here and the Arabs just in...
[02:02:05.305 --> 02:02:06.325]  And they're still out there.
[02:02:06.365 --> 02:02:07.206]  We need to watch them.
[02:02:07.326 --> 02:02:08.146]  That was the thrust of it.
[02:02:08.166 --> 02:02:13.429]  But then the question they don't ask is why the feds didn't grab the 12 surveillance camera tapes and not release them.
[02:02:13.890 --> 02:02:16.371]  They didn't say anything about the surveillance tapes.
[02:02:16.391 --> 02:02:20.374]  They didn't say anything about the bombs that were carried out.
[02:02:20.414 --> 02:02:23.315]  Yeah, so the question is why didn't the feds go after these Arabs?
[02:02:23.615 --> 02:02:27.178]  Because they were Iraqis trained during the 80s when Saddam was our ally.
[02:02:27.818 --> 02:02:30.940]  They were then taken back to the U.S.
[02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:32.761]  and they're still alive doing quite nicely.
[02:02:34.164 --> 02:02:34.684]  How dare them?
[02:02:35.324 --> 02:02:36.004]  Anything else, sir?
[02:02:36.965 --> 02:02:39.725]  I got an index of your 9-1-1 road to tyranny.
[02:02:39.785 --> 02:02:41.606]  I sent that to your email.
[02:02:41.646 --> 02:02:41.966]  Stay there.
[02:02:43.466 --> 02:02:44.966]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:45.166 --> 02:02:48.247]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:48.387 --> 02:02:52.288]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:52.348 --> 02:02:56.649]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:02:56.909 --> 02:03:00.710]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:00.830 --> 02:03:02.630]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:02.890 --> 02:03:06.133]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:03:06.173 --> 02:03:10.896]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:11.037 --> 02:03:14.079]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:14.259 --> 02:03:17.121]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:17.622 --> 02:03:23.727]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:24.267 --> 02:03:28.070]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:04:40.607 --> 02:04:47.749]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glass, who is a pharmacist from Marks Plaza Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[02:04:47.910 --> 02:04:49.110]  Hi, Alan, welcome to the program.
[02:04:49.310 --> 02:04:49.870]  Thank you, Marvin.
[02:04:50.050 --> 02:04:53.411]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[02:04:53.591 --> 02:04:54.111]  Is that true?
[02:04:54.332 --> 02:04:55.332]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[02:04:55.352 --> 02:04:58.333]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[02:04:58.393 --> 02:04:58.633]  price.
[02:04:58.853 --> 02:05:00.894]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[02:05:00.914 --> 02:05:01.694]  They're very common.
[02:05:01.814 --> 02:05:04.995]  Those common drugs you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[02:05:05.015 --> 02:05:05.255]  price.
[02:05:05.555 --> 02:05:06.716]  Now what about Tamoxifen?
[02:05:06.736 --> 02:05:09.158]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[02:05:09.358 --> 02:05:13.142]  Tamoxifen, you can see a 75% savings against a regular U.S.
[02:05:13.182 --> 02:05:13.442]  price.
[02:05:13.822 --> 02:05:16.245]  Now are these brand name products made by the same companies?
[02:05:16.485 --> 02:05:18.506]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[02:05:18.527 --> 02:05:20.628]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.
[02:05:20.829 --> 02:05:25.753]  So to save money on prescription drugs in Canada, call the toll-free number for your information package.
[02:05:26.013 --> 02:05:27.754]  To find out more, call toll-free 1-800-840-0686.
[02:05:27.814 --> 02:05:28.174]  That's 1-800-840-0686.
[02:05:28.194 --> 02:05:29.655]  Or go on the web at www.canshipdrugs.com.
[02:05:55.919 --> 02:06:00.343]  We're going to go back to Ken and Brian and Sherry and Mike and others here in a few minutes.
[02:06:02.064 --> 02:06:18.518]  Ken called in, I didn't see it, though I've gotten some emails about it, and now he's called about it, a History Channel documentary where they admit, ooh, there's these evil Muslims and they work with right-wing militias, and boy, there was other people involved in Oklahoma City.
[02:06:19.439 --> 02:06:22.341]  And again, years ago I predicted how they would do this.
[02:06:22.381 --> 02:06:22.962]  How did I know?
[02:06:23.933 --> 02:06:24.493]  I don't know.
[02:06:44.657 --> 02:06:50.441]  Why would they then have these so-called sources we could trust come out and admit that there were more bombers?
[02:06:50.721 --> 02:06:54.064]  But at the same time, why did Bill Clinton have people called off their tail?
[02:06:55.404 --> 02:06:58.226]  All of this was 100 different indicators, and I said, you watch.
[02:06:58.687 --> 02:07:10.495]  They went away to nexus conservative patriots, homeschoolers, what have you, which is the real FEMA demonization program going on with police departments right now, the real propagandizing.
[02:07:10.975 --> 02:07:11.996]  Why are they going to...
[02:07:13.494 --> 02:07:14.474]  Why are they doing this?
[02:07:14.574 --> 02:07:15.274]  What are they going to do?
[02:07:15.774 --> 02:07:23.436]  It was pretty clear they were setting it up to later bring it out as a nexus point and go, oh look, the evil right-wingers work with Al-Qaeda.
[02:07:25.536 --> 02:07:33.178]  And it looks like a program they were going to blame on Saddam and for some reason they cancelled it because there were too many witnesses and too many holes in it.
[02:07:33.618 --> 02:07:38.719]  So they just went with a McVeigh angle to get Patriot Act 1 passed.
[02:07:39.637 --> 02:07:41.759]  Really, Patriot Act I was Patriot Act II.
[02:07:42.039 --> 02:07:44.341]  What Bush is going to sign today is really Patriot Act III.
[02:07:44.361 --> 02:07:51.828]  It was called the Anti-Terrorism Effective Death Penalty Act, but it was a precursor to Patriot Act I, and they did get that passed.
[02:07:51.868 --> 02:08:04.240]  He'd failed a few months before 9-11, and his approval rating was at 32%, and then he told USA Today a year later on Air Force One in 1996 that he owed his political revival to the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:08:05.293 --> 02:08:09.155]  Kind of like Karl Rove going, oh, thank you, Bin Laden, we owe the election to you.
[02:08:09.175 --> 02:08:10.976]  I mean, it's so obvious.
[02:08:11.916 --> 02:08:21.782]  And so I knew that that's why they were ignoring the surveillance tape doing all this, and we tracked the Arabs, the Iraqis, back to being Republican Guard, trained here in the early 80s.
[02:08:22.882 --> 02:08:27.065]  Fought for Saddam in 1991, brought back in by Bush Sr.
[02:08:27.285 --> 02:08:40.434]  in 92, and Bill Clinton, another wave in 93, settled around town, police knew they were about to bomb something, tried to stop them, pulled off the case, they went with McVeigh, truth of structure,
[02:08:41.115 --> 02:08:44.498]  McVeigh thought it was some type of training operation, a drill.
[02:08:44.878 --> 02:08:47.039]  So did the BATF, all dressed up in their outfits.
[02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:48.901]  They called police, said get out of the building.
[02:08:48.941 --> 02:08:51.563]  BATF was out, called the federal judge, told them to get out.
[02:08:52.203 --> 02:08:53.524]  And that's public fact.
[02:08:53.544 --> 02:08:55.045]  I mean, police are on record saying this.
[02:08:55.486 --> 02:08:58.468]  They blow the building up and then somehow started changing the story.
[02:08:59.188 --> 02:09:00.849]  And again, it's a very complex issue.
[02:09:00.889 --> 02:09:06.834]  I could calmly go over it for like an hour to try to give you a full grasp on it, why I knew this would happen.
[02:09:07.394 --> 02:09:08.355]  I said it would happen.
[02:09:09.176 --> 02:09:13.920]  And again, I just want people to take serious what I'm saying because I'm not very articulate.
[02:09:14.801 --> 02:09:16.662]  I'm much better at understanding things.
[02:09:17.343 --> 02:09:20.925]  And it sounds like some people say I'm gifted at articulating.
[02:09:21.065 --> 02:09:21.806]  Actually, I'm not.
[02:09:22.246 --> 02:09:33.956]  It's very hard for me to articulate because there's hundreds of pieces of data that I integrate together in my mind and try to understand motives and globalist past activities.
[02:09:36.217 --> 02:09:38.179]  I call it a prime projection.
[02:09:40.341 --> 02:09:42.522]  Or what did the founder of the John Birch Society call it?
[02:09:42.562 --> 02:09:43.243]  He was good at that.
[02:09:43.403 --> 02:09:49.367]  He called it focusing the lines, different lines of information.
[02:09:51.568 --> 02:09:52.569]  It's a complex issue.
[02:09:52.809 --> 02:10:01.734]  It's like, I just knew what they'd do, and I know what their other plans are, and they're so horrible I hate to even talk about them.
[02:10:02.315 --> 02:10:05.117]  And they're going to do it unless we're able to stop them and get the word out.
[02:10:05.157 --> 02:10:07.138]  I mean, things would get very bad very quickly.
[02:10:08.686 --> 02:10:15.850]  And I'm begging humanity to wake up to what the New World Order is doing and do everything you can to stop it.
[02:10:17.030 --> 02:10:22.133]  We're about to go back to Ken and Brian and Sherry and Mike and others.
[02:10:22.173 --> 02:10:25.075]  But real quick, I'm honored to have her, Debbie Morrow.
[02:10:26.075 --> 02:10:31.458]  New Millennium Concepts has the holiday specials that are big discounts, great deals.
[02:10:32.679 --> 02:10:34.740]  They ship it out to you UPS.
[02:10:36.087 --> 02:10:36.568]  We're good to go.
[02:10:56.795 --> 02:11:08.561]  We'll have to add a little bit of money to the shipping charges for them to get where they need to go, especially the East Coast or the Far West Coast, you know, because we ship out of Colorado.
[02:11:08.881 --> 02:11:16.665]  So if you ship these now, today, if you ship them this afternoon, what day will they get there on average?
[02:11:17.986 --> 02:11:20.087]  Probably if they're going to go to, like...
[02:11:22.441 --> 02:11:31.649]  The East Coast, we would have to get them shipped today, and they would get there by Thursday or Friday.
[02:11:31.809 --> 02:11:35.052]  I know UPS is still going to deliver on Friday.
[02:11:35.112 --> 02:11:37.735]  They're not going to pick up, but they're going to deliver.
[02:11:38.736 --> 02:11:46.763]  So we really would like to try really hard to get as many orders out today or Monday as possible, because starting Monday when people call in,
[02:11:47.310 --> 02:11:52.426]  I will have to add extra shipping charges so that we can send it three-day express mail or UPS Express.
[02:11:54.701 --> 02:11:58.044]  Because we don't want anybody to not get their gifts before the holidays.
[02:11:58.084 --> 02:11:58.924]  Well, Debbie, you know what?
[02:11:59.084 --> 02:12:07.511]  I trust the government, and I just want to keep giving my family the local tap water with herbicide, pesticide, dead bacteria, heavy metals.
[02:12:08.051 --> 02:12:11.914]  I mean, you know, it smells like sewer water now here in Austin for two months straight.
[02:12:12.215 --> 02:12:14.356]  You know, why would I want to give my family clean water?
[02:12:14.636 --> 02:12:15.117]  I don't know.
[02:12:15.137 --> 02:12:23.083]  You know, Alex, the other day, I've been drinking water, Berkey water, for so long that I forgot what my city water tastes like.
[02:12:23.692 --> 02:12:30.536]  And the other morning, you know, I was up at 5.30 making my husband breakfast, and I thought, gee, I think, you know, I didn't even think.
[02:12:30.596 --> 02:12:32.897]  I just opened the tap and filled the teapot.
[02:12:32.917 --> 02:12:33.778]  Hey, I'll be honest, Debbie.
[02:12:33.818 --> 02:12:38.700]  Before you tell the story, I'm somebody who gets up at 3 a.m., you know, has to go to the bathroom.
[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:39.141]  Uh-huh.
[02:12:39.221 --> 02:12:41.122]  And then I'll literally cut my hand under the sink.
[02:12:41.802 --> 02:12:46.365]  And even when I'm half asleep, if I do that every once in a while unconsciously, it's like, ugh.
[02:12:46.685 --> 02:12:47.085]  I know.
[02:12:47.105 --> 02:12:47.645]  I know.
[02:12:47.666 --> 02:12:48.666]  But go ahead and tell your story.
[02:12:48.686 --> 02:12:51.968]  Well, I hadn't drank tap water in so long.
[02:12:52.481 --> 02:12:56.124]  And I thought, gee, I'm going to make some tea instead of coffee, you know?
[02:12:56.464 --> 02:13:08.194]  So I filled my teapot with the regular city water, not even thinking, and I thought, well, I'll leave the top off and I'll boil it, and that'll gas out the chlorine, you know, so it'll be okay.
[02:13:08.755 --> 02:13:13.819]  So I made my husband's instant oatmeal with it, and you know how you always take a bite, you know?
[02:13:14.224 --> 02:13:16.245]  Because I do that, take a bite of my husband's food.
[02:13:16.725 --> 02:13:18.126]  And it was horrible.
[02:13:18.146 --> 02:13:22.447]  I had to throw it away and remake it, you know, remake it with the Berkey water.
[02:13:22.467 --> 02:13:23.608]  Is that a woman thing?
[02:13:23.628 --> 02:13:25.008]  Because my wife always does that.
[02:13:25.028 --> 02:13:25.289]  It is.
[02:13:25.549 --> 02:13:29.030]  My husband never understood why I always used to take a bite of his sandwich.
[02:13:29.090 --> 02:13:32.872]  And I would say, well, honey, it's not that I don't want a whole sandwich.
[02:13:32.892 --> 02:13:34.332]  I just want a bite of yours.
[02:13:34.432 --> 02:13:36.313]  I think it's also like a mothering thing.
[02:13:36.573 --> 02:13:38.294]  It's like instinctive to test the food.
[02:13:38.314 --> 02:13:39.434]  I think so.
[02:13:39.454 --> 02:13:40.435]  I don't know.
[02:13:40.855 --> 02:13:43.276]  But it's just unbelievable how bad...
[02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:51.902]  And, you know, Grapevine, where I live in Texas here, has won awards for having the best tasting water in Texas and everything, you know.
[02:13:52.322 --> 02:13:54.022]  But it was incredible to me.
[02:13:54.062 --> 02:13:56.543]  Look, in Houston and Dallas, it tastes like kerosene.
[02:13:56.643 --> 02:13:59.564]  Austin supposedly, you know, has this good water out of the aquifer.
[02:13:59.784 --> 02:14:07.386]  Yeah, they take it out of the crisp aquifer, send it to a treatment plant, add all the chemicals and stuff, but now it tastes horrible and smells horrible.
[02:14:07.546 --> 02:14:08.186]  Yeah.
[02:14:08.286 --> 02:14:12.467]  So, I mean, folks, look, give Debbie a call, a bunch of different specials,
[02:14:13.127 --> 02:14:17.668]  Going right now, just give her a call, $1.99 for an incredible high-quality filter.
[02:14:18.208 --> 02:14:22.510]  A knockoff made in India costs the same price, and you don't get free gifts.
[02:14:23.130 --> 02:14:23.730]  Right.
[02:14:24.070 --> 02:14:29.831]  And then for $2.59, you get two free gifts and the big LEDs built in that last for 14 years.
[02:14:30.472 --> 02:14:33.592]  It's just an amazing, amazing deal.
[02:14:33.953 --> 02:14:35.893]  Give Debbie a call if she's busy.
[02:14:36.033 --> 02:14:36.713]  Leave her name and numbers.
[02:14:36.733 --> 02:14:37.513]  We'll call you right back.
[02:14:37.533 --> 02:14:37.573]  1-888-
[02:14:39.514 --> 02:14:50.156]  1-888-803-4438 1-888-803-4438 or BerkeyWater.com and tell them it's an Alex Jones special.
[02:14:50.596 --> 02:14:52.157]  That's the only way you get these discounts.
[02:14:52.497 --> 02:14:59.038]  An Alex Jones special when you go to the website in the comments section so you get the discount and tell them what free gift you want.
[02:14:59.058 --> 02:15:00.519]  The free gifts are listed there.
[02:15:00.539 --> 02:15:02.399]  A lot of really neat things there.
[02:15:02.419 --> 02:15:04.059]  1-888-803-4438 Anything else, Debbie?
[02:15:07.020 --> 02:15:15.426]  Well, just want to let people know, even though the recording says I'm closed on Friday, I am working today, and I will be calling people back up until 5 o'clock.
[02:15:15.606 --> 02:15:20.910]  So, you know, don't be discouraged if you get the machine and it says that I'm closed, because I'm really here.
[02:15:20.930 --> 02:15:22.251]  Okay, Debbie, thank you.
[02:15:22.371 --> 02:15:23.132]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:15:23.192 --> 02:15:23.752]  God bless.
[02:15:23.832 --> 02:15:24.193]  You bet.
[02:15:24.213 --> 02:15:25.033]  Have a good Christmas.
[02:15:25.354 --> 02:15:26.354]  Again, I'm politically incorrect.
[02:15:26.374 --> 02:15:26.975]  I said Christmas.
[02:15:26.995 --> 02:15:27.035]  888-803-4438.
[02:15:31.132 --> 02:15:34.737]  Okay, let's go back to Ken, and after the break I'll hurry to all the other callers.
[02:15:35.057 --> 02:15:41.025]  Ken in Kansas, you brought up this History Channel thing where, oh my gosh, the right wing works with Al-Qaeda now.
[02:15:41.645 --> 02:15:42.707]  Let's arrest everybody.
[02:15:43.268 --> 02:15:45.030]  But what else?
[02:15:46.448 --> 02:15:47.209]  He dropped off.
[02:15:47.229 --> 02:15:48.409]  He didn't like holding for 10 minutes.
[02:15:49.110 --> 02:15:49.410]  Okay.
[02:15:49.630 --> 02:15:50.351]  Ken, call me back.
[02:15:50.371 --> 02:15:52.132]  I want to hear what you wanted to add there.
[02:15:52.513 --> 02:15:53.393]  Sir, I apologize.
[02:15:53.653 --> 02:15:54.554]  Brian in Texas.
[02:15:54.594 --> 02:15:55.395]  Brian, go ahead.
[02:15:55.595 --> 02:15:56.676]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:15:57.156 --> 02:15:58.217]  Fired up as usual.
[02:15:58.277 --> 02:15:59.157]  Man, that's tight.
[02:15:59.237 --> 02:15:59.538]  All right.
[02:15:59.618 --> 02:16:04.101]  Well, no, basically I was just calling to first of all wish you a Merry Christmas.
[02:16:05.282 --> 02:16:07.343]  I hope everything goes great for you on this holiday.
[02:16:07.544 --> 02:16:08.624]  Well, I reciprocate.
[02:16:08.945 --> 02:16:09.245]  Yeah.
[02:16:09.825 --> 02:16:14.749]  Now, basically, you know, I was hearing you had a person on the
[02:16:15.202 --> 02:16:18.283]  Well, actually, the majority is angry about what's happening, but we're a minority in power.
[02:16:18.303 --> 02:16:21.664]  That is, the globalists are the majority in power positions.
[02:16:43.857 --> 02:16:53.939]  Well, basically, I've been taking these classes, these income tax classes, and my teacher's telling me things like, you know, Kerry paid a tax of 10% on his big estate.
[02:16:54.099 --> 02:16:55.120]  No, that's true.
[02:16:55.520 --> 02:16:59.161]  The elite has it to where you make a couple hundred thousand dollars a year, you pay 40%.
[02:16:59.421 --> 02:17:03.642]  You make a billion dollars a year, you pay like 10% or lower.
[02:17:04.202 --> 02:17:12.944]  Well, basically, to kind of cut to the chase is like, you know, I'm trying to figure out what direction I want to go, and I think this is what I want to do, but basically is...
[02:17:14.051 --> 02:17:16.032]  You know, what about the power of petitions?
[02:17:16.452 --> 02:17:17.853]  What happened to legal petitions?
[02:17:18.574 --> 02:17:19.134]  What do those do?
[02:17:19.154 --> 02:17:21.135]  They are very, very powerful, sir.
[02:17:21.315 --> 02:17:21.896]  Oh, is that right?
[02:17:21.936 --> 02:17:23.817]  That's what the recall was in California.
[02:17:24.157 --> 02:17:24.597]  Oh, really?
[02:17:24.978 --> 02:17:25.618]  Yeah, stay there.
[02:17:25.638 --> 02:17:27.359]  We'll briefly talk about it on the other side.
[02:17:27.919 --> 02:17:31.902]  Brian and then Sherry, Mike and others had a bunch of news coming up.
[02:17:32.942 --> 02:17:37.005]  We had the Judge Advocate General of the Navy on in the last hour.
[02:17:37.045 --> 02:17:37.825]  You really missed that.
[02:17:37.845 --> 02:17:39.026]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:44.229 --> 02:17:47.892]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:17:48.292 --> 02:17:53.716]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:17:54.197 --> 02:17:55.278]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:17:55.318 --> 02:17:59.301]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:18:00.001 --> 02:18:00.701]  We're good to go.
[02:18:00.801 --> 02:18:01.342]  We're good to go.
[02:18:25.913 --> 02:18:25.973]  1-800-686-2237
[02:18:44.167 --> 02:18:47.149]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:18:47.509 --> 02:18:56.335]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:18:56.655 --> 02:19:01.358]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:19:01.798 --> 02:19:08.503]  The Berkey Light is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:19:08.863 --> 02:19:09.543]  We're good to go.
[02:19:09.583 --> 02:19:10.363]  We're good to go.
[02:19:30.549 --> 02:19:30.569]  803-4438.
[02:19:30.589 --> 02:19:33.912]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:19:34.012 --> 02:19:36.735]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:19:36.895 --> 02:19:40.319]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:19:40.419 --> 02:19:41.520]  Not get available in Iowa.
[02:19:44.687 --> 02:19:46.768]  Those dark depressing days are here.
[02:19:47.489 --> 02:19:51.010]  Are you among the 15% of North Americans who suffer from the winter blues?
[02:19:51.590 --> 02:19:55.112]  This condition is simply caused by the lack of sunlight during the short winter days.
[02:19:55.792 --> 02:19:58.373]  Do you suffer from constant fatigue and lack of energy?
[02:19:58.833 --> 02:20:01.214]  Do you have a hard time pulling yourself out of bed in the morning?
[02:20:01.734 --> 02:20:03.095]  Do you put on weight in the winter?
[02:20:03.835 --> 02:20:04.296]  We're good to go.
[02:20:22.113 --> 02:20:23.615]  That's northernlighttechnologies.com.
[02:20:23.695 --> 02:20:24.956]  Our phone number again is 800-263-0066.
[02:20:46.132 --> 02:20:53.537]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[02:20:54.618 --> 02:21:04.305]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[02:21:05.206 --> 02:21:11.790]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.
[02:21:12.751 --> 02:21:21.595]  We would like to send you a one-year absolutely free subscription to Newswatch Magazine that gives you the background of what is happening in America.
[02:21:22.195 --> 02:21:23.696]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[02:21:23.716 --> 02:21:24.016]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:21:24.036 --> 02:21:24.296]  Call now.
[02:21:24.356 --> 02:21:29.778]  Our operators are standing by for an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:21:43.456 --> 02:21:56.501]  All right, I'm going to try to slow down, calm down, try to get to all the calls and just so much news that we've got to cover.
[02:21:58.022 --> 02:22:01.823]  Ken was able to get back in because I wouldn't be able to finish his points, but Brian briefly in Texas.
[02:22:02.364 --> 02:22:05.445]  Yes, Brian, if petitions are done correctly, you can recall governors.
[02:22:07.297 --> 02:22:16.042]  I suggest having petitions to demand a paper recount, a paper ballot recall of electronic voting machines.
[02:22:16.482 --> 02:22:21.984]  Because you can't recall the electronic fraud-driven machines with the machines.
[02:22:22.024 --> 02:22:25.446]  You have to have a petition and follow petition laws in your state.
[02:22:26.249 --> 02:22:27.270]  We're good to go.
[02:22:27.290 --> 02:22:27.850]  We're good to go.
[02:22:45.754 --> 02:23:00.665]  Your shire or county or borough, and then to be able to go in with a paper recount to order a paper recount to withdraw and recall the electronic voting machines.
[02:23:03.615 --> 02:23:05.597]  That's a mouthful, but that's what you do.
[02:23:05.797 --> 02:23:09.781]  And that's something I see as a chink in the armor of these electronic voting machines.
[02:23:10.182 --> 02:23:11.824]  And there's a lot of other things you can do with petitions.
[02:23:11.844 --> 02:23:13.265]  So go ahead, finish up what you were saying.
[02:23:13.405 --> 02:23:17.630]  Well, I'm trying to figure out where I'm going to be most effective, and I think I could do something like that.
[02:23:17.670 --> 02:23:21.253]  But right now I have an opportunity to work as a tax preparer.
[02:23:21.634 --> 02:23:22.695]  And I figure if I was to...
[02:23:23.351 --> 02:23:24.651]  Well, listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:23:24.671 --> 02:23:27.092]  And let me, in a nutshell, try to tell you something, Brian.
[02:23:53.727 --> 02:23:55.169]  The income tax is private.
[02:23:55.650 --> 02:23:57.292]  The 16th Amendment was never ratified.
[02:23:57.312 --> 02:23:58.013]  It is a fraud.
[02:23:58.033 --> 02:24:03.561]  And there's a lot of people out there using the government's own rules and laws that don't pay taxes.
[02:24:04.483 --> 02:24:05.284]  But let me tell you something.
[02:24:06.181 --> 02:24:09.682]  It's dangerous because the government is criminal and will still prosecute you.
[02:24:10.163 --> 02:24:13.284]  And I do not advise people to get out of the tax system.
[02:24:13.804 --> 02:24:16.165]  And a lot of people get mad at me over this.
[02:24:16.845 --> 02:24:17.306]  And it's true.
[02:24:17.326 --> 02:24:21.847]  They'll still prosecute you if you've paid more than what they say you're supposed to pay because they're criminals.
[02:24:22.448 --> 02:24:28.210]  But I'm telling you, people that say, I have a magic bullet that makes it legal for you not to pay taxes, yeah, it is legal.
[02:24:29.375 --> 02:24:32.296]  Okay, all these other taxes are constitutional, not the income tax.
[02:24:32.956 --> 02:24:34.357]  But still, it's a fraud.
[02:24:34.857 --> 02:24:36.177]  It's force of the gun.
[02:24:36.578 --> 02:24:37.718]  It's the black ski mask.
[02:24:37.798 --> 02:24:38.678]  It's despotism.
[02:24:39.619 --> 02:24:41.819]  I mean, look, the White House says they're above the law.
[02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:43.860]  It doesn't work like that.
[02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:45.801]  And I don't want people getting hurt out there.
[02:24:46.445 --> 02:24:48.026]  And you can get hurt paying taxes.
[02:24:48.286 --> 02:24:56.168]  People pay what they're supposed to under the scam, and they do it all, and still the government comes after them to steal them blind.
[02:24:56.428 --> 02:24:58.309]  So it's bad filing them too.
[02:24:58.949 --> 02:25:00.590]  That's a decision you've got to make, folks.
[02:25:00.810 --> 02:25:03.611]  I am not going to tell people not to file, and I'm not going to tell you to file.
[02:25:04.726 --> 02:25:10.490]  I pay taxes, the income tax, just because I don't care about money, and I know it funds their system.
[02:25:10.510 --> 02:25:11.251]  Well, it really doesn't.
[02:25:11.571 --> 02:25:13.352]  They print the money out of nothing, folks.
[02:25:13.932 --> 02:25:15.834]  It's a control system, okay?
[02:25:15.994 --> 02:25:16.874]  They'll just print more money.
[02:25:17.755 --> 02:25:20.016]  I pay it because that's not a battle I chose to fight.
[02:25:20.697 --> 02:25:22.958]  I don't want to spend all my time dealing with it in court.
[02:25:23.218 --> 02:25:31.324]  And then if they ever come after me, they'll have to totally railroad me because I actually sit there with my accountant and go, you know what, I want to pay a little extra.
[02:25:32.561 --> 02:25:41.123]  They have the conservative way to do it or the liberal way to do it, and I go with the conservative way and set the computer program to where I'm totally on the safe side.
[02:25:41.523 --> 02:25:44.723]  And I have records of all of it because of the position I'm in.
[02:25:46.003 --> 02:25:46.324]  Simple.
[02:25:46.824 --> 02:25:50.604]  So take my advice for what it's worth or put your head in the tiger's mouth.
[02:25:51.564 --> 02:25:53.985]  Let's go ahead and go back to Ken in Kansas.
[02:25:54.305 --> 02:25:55.685]  Ken, you had a point you were going to finish.
[02:25:56.165 --> 02:25:58.266]  Yeah, we had covered pretty much everything.
[02:25:58.286 --> 02:25:59.906]  There's one little thing I wanted to add.
[02:26:00.681 --> 02:26:07.803]  One of the people interviewed on that Oklahoma City History Channel cover-up... Yeah, demonization piece, yeah.
[02:26:07.863 --> 02:26:13.144]  Yeah, it was William Jasper, who writes for the Birch Society.
[02:26:13.925 --> 02:26:20.726]  I've read some of their publications in the New American, and I'm not sure whose side they're on.
[02:26:21.507 --> 02:26:22.607]  Well, you know, it's very interesting.
[02:26:22.667 --> 02:26:29.769]  I saw Jasper out at the Urban Warfare training drills for Urban Warrior in 99, and he will not come on this radio show...
[02:26:30.839 --> 02:26:31.439]  We're good to go.
[02:26:59.505 --> 02:27:04.369]  Yeah, they march right down to the 10-yard line and stop, hunt.
[02:27:04.409 --> 02:27:05.770]  They don't even go for the field goal.
[02:27:06.350 --> 02:27:07.811]  It's like a brick wall.
[02:27:07.851 --> 02:27:11.334]  They won't go past that.
[02:27:11.935 --> 02:27:17.859]  No, it is very curious, but he's done a lot of good reporting on Oklahoma City, but he focuses too much on Elohim City.
[02:27:17.879 --> 02:27:18.900]  Is that what happened in the show?
[02:27:20.201 --> 02:27:20.261]  Uh...
[02:27:21.451 --> 02:27:25.154]  I don't recall exactly what he said, but it was part of the whitewash.
[02:27:25.394 --> 02:27:26.215]  Anything else, Ken?
[02:27:27.036 --> 02:27:28.257]  That's a good percentage of it.
[02:27:28.517 --> 02:27:29.157]  God bless you.
[02:27:30.158 --> 02:27:31.479]  Look forward to getting that video from you.
[02:27:33.961 --> 02:27:34.862]  We're on the march.
[02:27:35.362 --> 02:27:36.964]  The Empire's on the run.

[02:28:49.934 --> 02:28:56.101]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:56.381 --> 02:29:04.771]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:05.071 --> 02:29:12.095]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:12.375 --> 02:29:17.218]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.

[02:29:55.945 --> 02:30:02.967]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:03.347 --> 02:30:09.469]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:09.609 --> 02:30:10.809]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:11.049 --> 02:30:11.490]  We're good to go.

[02:30:35.672 --> 02:30:38.273]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:03.061 --> 02:31:05.923]  No, I have a lot of friends that are in the John Birch Society.
[02:31:08.504 --> 02:31:09.725]  And they've done a lot of great work.
[02:31:09.765 --> 02:31:12.807]  And I know that Mr. Welsh was a great man.
[02:31:15.008 --> 02:31:16.369]  And they do a lot of really good work.
[02:31:16.469 --> 02:31:20.212]  But what you've noticed is something I've noticed.
[02:31:22.433 --> 02:31:24.374]  And on key issues, they're out there fighting.
[02:31:24.414 --> 02:31:30.358]  But then on a lot of other key issues that are admitted, I mean, just a few years ago, they were still saying Gulf War illness doesn't exist.
[02:31:33.370 --> 02:31:34.571]  I mean, now it's been all over the news.
[02:31:34.631 --> 02:31:35.211]  It's admitted.
[02:31:39.033 --> 02:31:40.774]  It's strange.
[02:31:40.954 --> 02:31:49.059]  And, man, I can call up the former judge advocate general, the dean of a large, prestigious Ivy League law school, and he comes right on.
[02:31:51.260 --> 02:31:52.701]  I can call up Hollywood people.
[02:31:52.801 --> 02:31:53.882]  I know they'll come right on.
[02:31:53.942 --> 02:31:55.863]  They know how important it is to work hard and get the word out.
[02:31:56.363 --> 02:31:58.964]  Man, it's like battering your head up against armor plating.
[02:31:59.044 --> 02:32:01.746]  I've been calling for five years.
[02:32:02.594 --> 02:32:03.574]  Coming up on six.
[02:32:05.015 --> 02:32:06.455]  Three or four times a year we call up.
[02:32:06.495 --> 02:32:07.656]  I'd like Mr. Jasper on.
[02:32:07.676 --> 02:32:08.776]  I'd like Mr. McManus on.
[02:32:08.816 --> 02:32:13.558]  I'd like Mr. Mrs. Oh, they're not doing interviews right now.
[02:32:13.618 --> 02:32:14.819]  Call back in six months.
[02:32:15.279 --> 02:32:16.679]  They're working on a project right now.
[02:32:16.939 --> 02:32:17.480]  Six months later.
[02:32:17.500 --> 02:32:18.420]  I'd like to have them on, please.
[02:32:21.141 --> 02:32:23.682]  So, they certainly don't have hot blood.
[02:32:25.322 --> 02:32:26.603]  They're certainly not hungry.
[02:32:27.549 --> 02:32:39.293]  I mean, if I have to hand Jasper, because I had a folder going around with me because I was doing radio, my own radio show, calling into it, doing radio interviews when I was out at Urban Warrior, covering Urban Warrior Takeover.
[02:32:39.353 --> 02:32:42.774]  I look over and it's William F. Jasper, who I've put on TV.
[02:32:42.834 --> 02:32:44.195]  I've put his documentaries on locally.
[02:32:44.675 --> 02:32:45.295]  Mr. Jasper!
[02:32:45.315 --> 02:32:46.436]  And he goes, Alex Jones!
[02:32:46.676 --> 02:32:47.516]  He knew who I was.
[02:32:48.236 --> 02:32:49.277]  I wasn't very well known in 99.
[02:32:51.294 --> 02:32:52.736]  And I said, how are you doing, sir?
[02:32:52.756 --> 02:32:56.740]  And I said, you guys write articles about black helicopters not existing.
[02:32:57.040 --> 02:33:14.638]  And we're standing there with black helicopters, gray helicopters, white helicopters, flying around, 4,000 Marines, a couple thousand foreign troops, German, Dutch, Israeli, Australian, Swiss, just, not Swiss, British, Australian, just swarming.
[02:33:15.339 --> 02:33:17.201]  And I go, well, I happen to have a folder.
[02:33:17.241 --> 02:33:20.684]  So I looked over to the fellow who was with me, and I said, pull that folder out of the backpack, please.
[02:33:21.244 --> 02:33:22.925]  Pull it out, and I go, here's Associated Press.
[02:33:24.427 --> 02:33:27.629]  South Texas Urban Warfare, black helicopters, headline.
[02:33:28.270 --> 02:33:29.871]  And he goes, whoa, whoa.
[02:33:30.572 --> 02:33:33.634]  Well, to his credit, it was in the magazine a month later.
[02:33:34.435 --> 02:33:35.716]  The very article.
[02:33:39.720 --> 02:33:42.542]  So, I don't know what they're doing up there.
[02:33:45.609 --> 02:33:47.130]  I don't know what planet they live on.
[02:33:47.150 --> 02:33:48.991]  I don't know.
[02:33:49.792 --> 02:33:51.313]  That makes me think they're not bad.
[02:33:51.333 --> 02:33:54.835]  I know they're doing a lot of good work, so I'm not going to attack them.
[02:33:56.696 --> 02:34:01.600]  You can't get them on the radio, and they don't know about black helicopters until I hand deliver it to them.
[02:34:03.861 --> 02:34:07.324]  And again, they had articles months before about how black helicopters don't exist.
[02:34:08.324 --> 02:34:08.945]  They don't exist.
[02:34:08.985 --> 02:34:11.466]  They're called the Night Stalkers, Fort Campbell, Kentucky.
[02:34:11.726 --> 02:34:13.648]  That's just one group of squadrons.
[02:34:16.147 --> 02:34:22.869]  They have a special black metallic paint that is semi-radar resistant, absorbs radar waves, doesn't bounce them back.
[02:34:24.970 --> 02:34:27.030]  It's basically ground up.
[02:34:27.090 --> 02:34:28.731]  It's the same stuff that magnetic tape is.
[02:34:28.751 --> 02:34:32.232]  It's powdered magnetic tape in black paint.
[02:34:33.272 --> 02:34:35.113]  That's why those helicopters are black, folks.
[02:34:35.653 --> 02:34:37.373]  And FEMA's got squadrons of them.
[02:34:37.853 --> 02:34:38.674]  We've got photos.
[02:34:38.774 --> 02:34:42.855]  I've seen black Russian Heinz flying around for heaven's sake.
[02:34:44.815 --> 02:34:46.396]  I've been in urban warfare training drills.
[02:34:46.456 --> 02:34:50.719]  I've had Delta Force walk over and put us in handcuffs on city streets.
[02:34:52.100 --> 02:34:53.942]  And, by the way, they took our tape and erased it.
[02:34:53.962 --> 02:34:54.883]  That's why you never saw that.
[02:34:55.463 --> 02:34:56.784]  Though it was in World Net Daily.
[02:34:56.824 --> 02:34:57.985]  World Net Daily did an article about it.
[02:34:59.886 --> 02:35:02.408]  So, I mean, you know, I'm here with guys aiming guns at me.
[02:35:02.808 --> 02:35:04.330]  Mike Hansen's being arrested.
[02:35:05.290 --> 02:35:07.212]  And these people are saying it doesn't exist.
[02:35:07.232 --> 02:35:11.575]  I mean, I'm there videotaping as buildings are exploding.
[02:35:14.238 --> 02:35:19.561]  I'm going and interviewing police chiefs who've thrown Delta Force out of the city for trying to bribe public officials.
[02:35:23.343 --> 02:35:25.284]  By the way, that's all in Police State 2000.
[02:35:26.843 --> 02:35:35.506]  Like 30 minutes of a two-hour, five-minute film is black helicopters terrorizing and attacking and front-page news stories all over the state and an actual video of it.
[02:35:36.106 --> 02:35:44.108]  And two police chiefs speaking out against it, a mayor speaking out against it, one police chief who just loved it and says foreign troops are here but he can't talk about it.
[02:35:45.048 --> 02:35:46.749]  That's 30 minutes of a two-hour film.
[02:35:46.789 --> 02:35:49.830]  So you start getting an idea of what's in my videos.
[02:35:49.910 --> 02:35:50.770]  It's indescribable.
[02:35:53.376 --> 02:35:58.158]  See, I don't stop working, folks, and then I try to condense it all into the film so you can see it all.
[02:35:59.379 --> 02:36:09.684]  Go to prisonplanet.tv, 15 cents a day, you can watch all 11 of my films, read my book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV reports, stuff that nobody ever gets to see because they don't go in the films.
[02:36:10.865 --> 02:36:11.405]  You get it all.
[02:36:11.425 --> 02:36:13.406]  15 cents a day, why not do it?
[02:36:14.412 --> 02:36:16.053]  All right, I'll plug that later.
[02:36:16.753 --> 02:36:18.094]  I want to go to your calls quickly.
[02:36:18.154 --> 02:36:19.375]  I'll take the calls that are holding.
[02:36:19.955 --> 02:36:21.676]  Sherry and Mike and Myron and Kitty.
[02:36:22.057 --> 02:36:23.778]  And that's it, because I've got some news I want to hit.
[02:36:24.758 --> 02:36:27.120]  Let's talk to, is it Sherry in Michigan?
[02:36:27.220 --> 02:36:27.640]  Welcome.
[02:36:27.860 --> 02:36:28.381]  Yes, hi.
[02:36:29.061 --> 02:36:30.222]  I have so much to tell you.
[02:36:30.422 --> 02:36:38.947]  If we can't do it all right now, when you're done, if you could get on the phone with me and there's John Conyers, who I know personally,
[02:36:39.623 --> 02:36:44.786]  He would like to hear true information, so I told Joyce Riley to call him.
[02:36:45.187 --> 02:36:49.949]  And regarding the election, he's having the FBI check it out, but I don't believe we can trust them.
[02:36:50.430 --> 02:36:52.611]  I think that these machines are being manipulated.
[02:36:52.631 --> 02:36:54.592]  Well, you can't trust John Conyers either.
[02:36:54.772 --> 02:36:55.573]  Why is that, sir?
[02:36:55.893 --> 02:36:56.974]  He's a gun grabber.
[02:36:56.994 --> 02:36:58.555]  He's a fake liberal.
[02:36:58.575 --> 02:36:59.755]  I'm not trying to be mean to you.
[02:36:59.775 --> 02:37:02.257]  I mean, Kerry didn't challenge the election, did he?
[02:37:02.897 --> 02:37:05.199]  And I know that Congress is doing an investigation.
[02:37:05.279 --> 02:37:05.719]  I know that.
[02:37:07.018 --> 02:37:13.800]  So maybe he's right on this issue, but maybe their aide told you, yeah, we want to hear from him, but I doubt that.
[02:37:14.060 --> 02:37:19.882]  Well, I knew Conyers way before he got married, and I spoke with him a week ago.
[02:37:20.062 --> 02:37:21.503]  Well, maybe he will talk to me.
[02:37:21.703 --> 02:37:22.443]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[02:37:22.683 --> 02:37:24.924]  I spoke with him a week ago about Joyce Riley.
[02:37:24.984 --> 02:37:28.845]  He said, let her come forward, and he thought that I had absolute proof.
[02:37:28.945 --> 02:37:32.826]  I don't have absolute proof, or at least I don't think I do, but I wanted him to let me
[02:37:33.314 --> 02:37:34.375]  Talk to him on the phone.
[02:37:34.435 --> 02:37:36.598]  And I thought, same thing with Joyce Riley today.
[02:37:36.618 --> 02:37:38.621]  Okay, but I mean, absolute proof of what specifically?
[02:37:38.661 --> 02:37:45.950]  Well, I mean, like all the things that you're talking about and what Joyce Riley is trying to get out, I know a lot of things, but I don't have the proof.
[02:37:46.170 --> 02:37:48.193]  And so Mr. Conyers said, bring it to me.
[02:37:48.273 --> 02:37:48.793]  I want it.
[02:37:49.014 --> 02:37:51.657]  Well, look, ma'am, I mean, do you have a computer?
[02:37:52.817 --> 02:37:54.078]  No, I don't.
[02:37:55.738 --> 02:38:01.381]  There are thousands of news articles, hundreds of them mainstream, where there was election fraud coast to coast.
[02:38:01.601 --> 02:38:02.001]  Oh, I know.
[02:38:02.101 --> 02:38:03.101]  I have a lot of information.
[02:38:03.121 --> 02:38:05.842]  And by the way, Democrats were engaged in some of it.
[02:38:06.343 --> 02:38:06.663]  I know.
[02:38:06.943 --> 02:38:08.743]  But predominantly it was Republican.
[02:38:08.904 --> 02:38:09.384]  But you know what?
[02:38:09.524 --> 02:38:13.525]  I think if there was machine tampering, there's probably no way to count the votes.
[02:38:13.585 --> 02:38:16.206]  But ma'am, it's not tampering.
[02:38:17.227 --> 02:38:19.088]  I mean, it was done on purpose.
[02:38:19.148 --> 02:38:20.008]  It's set up to do it.
[02:38:20.228 --> 02:38:24.111]  Right, but I think the machines were tampered with besides what you're talking about.
[02:38:24.411 --> 02:38:29.174]  So there's probably no way to count votes because the whole thing was false.
[02:38:29.234 --> 02:38:30.035]  No, you're right.
[02:38:30.095 --> 02:38:31.836]  They're designed for no recount.
[02:38:32.096 --> 02:38:33.417]  That's been the complaint.
[02:38:33.617 --> 02:38:40.141]  Right, but besides that, I heard that people voted many, many times and people were trying to prevent blacks from voting.
[02:38:40.181 --> 02:38:41.882]  There's so much fraud all over the place.
[02:38:42.383 --> 02:38:45.565]  But also I wanted to tell you some other things you may not have ever heard about.
[02:38:45.956 --> 02:38:49.518]  There's a book called The Taking of America 1-2-3 by Richard Sprague.
[02:38:49.538 --> 02:38:50.478]  Are you familiar with it?
[02:38:51.098 --> 02:38:51.719]  Heard the name.
[02:38:51.979 --> 02:38:59.362]  Okay, now that book says that Bush Sr., when he was leaving the CIA, he was the head of it as the director.
[02:38:59.833 --> 02:39:05.494]  He put 25 CAA reps in the heads of the media organizations to stay there for years to come.
[02:39:05.834 --> 02:39:07.115]  Well, that even came before that.
[02:39:07.155 --> 02:39:11.236]  That came out in the 70s during the church committees.
[02:39:11.716 --> 02:39:13.776]  That's called Operation Mockingbird.
[02:39:13.956 --> 02:39:17.377]  And I believe they're probably still there for years to come.
[02:39:17.417 --> 02:39:19.438]  That's why we're not getting enough truth.
[02:39:19.478 --> 02:39:20.718]  It's a lot worse than that.
[02:39:20.738 --> 02:39:22.639]  It's not 25.
[02:39:22.699 --> 02:39:22.839]  Right.
[02:39:22.859 --> 02:39:23.119]  How about 2,500?
[02:39:23.319 --> 02:39:25.579]  And then also, I heard you on...
[02:39:29.164 --> 02:39:31.705]  Look, I can hear the concern in your voice, and I'm glad you're involved.
[02:39:31.725 --> 02:39:33.045]  Just keep moving forward, and God bless you.
[02:39:33.085 --> 02:39:33.946]  Take care.
[02:39:56.408 --> 02:39:57.728]  I appreciate your call.
[02:39:58.768 --> 02:40:04.449]  Look, again, every day people call and say, man, I want you on Coast to Coast AM tonight, tonight, tonight.
[02:40:05.009 --> 02:40:07.370]  I'm honored they have me on on average every month and a half.
[02:40:08.590 --> 02:40:11.251]  And, you know, talking to tens of millions of people.
[02:40:11.331 --> 02:40:12.411]  It's a great opportunity.
[02:40:14.431 --> 02:40:17.192]  But, I mean, I don't lobby them every day to have me on.
[02:40:17.272 --> 02:40:18.592]  If they want me on, they have me on.
[02:40:20.072 --> 02:40:22.912]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:40:24.413 --> 02:40:25.673]  Mike, where are you calling us from?
[02:40:26.152 --> 02:40:27.474]  I'm from Windsor, Ontario, Canada.
[02:40:27.694 --> 02:40:28.035]  Welcome!
[02:40:28.455 --> 02:40:28.615]  Hi.
[02:40:29.797 --> 02:40:33.502]  Just a quick question and a comment on the Gary Webb murder.
[02:40:35.581 --> 02:40:38.742]  Now, now, now, you know everybody can shoot themselves twice in the head.
[02:40:39.022 --> 02:40:43.142]  The coroner now admits he did shoot himself twice in the face with a .38 Special.
[02:40:43.462 --> 02:40:44.603]  It's totally impossible.
[02:40:44.623 --> 02:40:54.424]  It's like, you know, it'd be like claiming that this woman who had the murderers cut her baby out and kill her up in Kansas City, it'd be like claiming she did it to herself.
[02:40:54.704 --> 02:40:55.825]  It's that ridiculous.
[02:40:55.925 --> 02:40:56.245]  She did.
[02:40:57.125 --> 02:41:02.566]  In the summertime on PrisonPlanet.tv, you were on your cable show.
[02:41:02.586 --> 02:41:03.466]  Somebody called in.
[02:41:04.122 --> 02:41:05.423]  I don't remember.
[02:41:05.463 --> 02:41:07.284]  I'm not placing what you're saying.
[02:41:07.304 --> 02:41:07.544]  Okay.
[02:41:07.564 --> 02:41:08.244]  He called in.
[02:41:08.304 --> 02:41:13.427]  He said he worked for a major hotel firm, and they received a notice that they were supposed to...
[02:41:23.511 --> 02:41:27.475]  Go out and check people's cars and see if they had anything illegal in it.
[02:41:27.715 --> 02:41:28.636]  Yes, I did.
[02:41:28.876 --> 02:41:29.717]  I did get that.
[02:41:30.057 --> 02:41:33.180]  And it was one of the biggest hotel chains out there.
[02:41:33.860 --> 02:41:45.631]  And it did tell them how to go out and search cars when they valet park them or when they're in the parking garage and to look for drugs or terrorist implements.
[02:41:46.531 --> 02:41:49.154]  And it said that we're doing this for the...
[02:41:50.342 --> 02:41:54.995]  For different big events, but that soon it was going to be nationwide, everyday occurrence.
[02:41:55.683 --> 02:41:56.924]  Okay, did you post that at all or no?
[02:41:56.944 --> 02:41:59.046]  You know, I'm going to be quite honest with you.
[02:41:59.606 --> 02:42:09.574]  Out of the hundreds of things that shoot out of the fax machine and everything, I printed it off and put it in a pile and don't know where it is and never did anything with it.
[02:42:09.594 --> 02:42:10.875]  All right, I've been looking for that.
[02:42:10.935 --> 02:42:13.337]  But a comment on the Gary Webb.
[02:42:13.758 --> 02:42:15.459]  I work for the coroner.
[02:42:15.479 --> 02:42:16.440]  Let me stop you for a second.
[02:42:16.460 --> 02:42:17.581]  You brought up a bunch of different issues.
[02:42:18.061 --> 02:42:21.224]  Since you brought that up, that's an example of what it's like here.
[02:42:21.904 --> 02:42:29.889]  I mean, it's just wall-to-wall corruption, wall-to-wall, out-of-control stuff, and I'm just wallowing in government corruption.
[02:42:29.929 --> 02:42:31.490]  I mean, there's just so much of it.
[02:42:32.391 --> 02:42:38.495]  It's like I'm trying to stick my finger in the dike, the little Dutch boy, and the whole thing's already broken.
[02:42:38.915 --> 02:42:39.075]  Right.
[02:42:39.316 --> 02:42:41.217]  I mean, just to try to cover it all is insane.
[02:42:41.497 --> 02:42:44.479]  In fact, I won't get to cover it unless I let you go here in a second, so be quick.
[02:42:44.853 --> 02:43:03.047]  Okay, yeah, I was just going to say that I do pickups for the coroners and funerals here, and I've been on many cases where people have shot themselves, self-inflicted gunshot wounds with, like, .30-06 rifles and whatnot like that, and it definitely blows the whole head apart, and nobody ever has time to pull the trigger a second time.
[02:43:03.067 --> 02:43:04.188]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:43:05.329 --> 02:43:07.691]  Well, I'm glad you gave us that eyewitness report.
[02:43:07.711 --> 02:43:07.791]  Look...
[02:43:09.286 --> 02:43:16.392]  We have on the website links to a site that has famous incidences of people blowing their heads off on TV.
[02:43:17.133 --> 02:43:18.794]  You know, where the weatherman goes, it's all over!
[02:43:18.814 --> 02:43:21.777]  And you shoot yourself in the face.
[02:43:22.197 --> 02:43:26.501]  If it was a blank, the gas would knock your head back and knock you on the ground.
[02:43:26.962 --> 02:43:28.283]  Probably puncture your skin.
[02:43:28.743 --> 02:43:30.064]  You shoot yourself, folks.
[02:43:30.104 --> 02:43:30.545]  Imagine.
[02:43:31.305 --> 02:43:31.566]  You know...
[02:43:33.379 --> 02:43:35.460]  It's like trying to beat yourself to death with a hammer.
[02:43:35.480 --> 02:43:38.602]  You know, you can hit yourself pretty hard the first time, but it gets harder and harder.
[02:43:39.023 --> 02:43:43.826]  You don't take a gun and shoot yourself in the face and go, gee, let me cock the revolver again.
[02:43:43.866 --> 02:43:48.049]  Turned out it was a revolver, not a shotgun, the coroner says, and shot himself again in the head.
[02:43:48.609 --> 02:43:49.670]  That is ridiculous.
[02:43:49.710 --> 02:43:50.490]  Thanks for bringing that up.
[02:43:50.831 --> 02:43:54.393]  Describe for people what it looks like when somebody shoots themselves in the head.
[02:43:55.214 --> 02:44:01.358]  Well, depending on the type of gun, like .30-06 definitely blows the whole head totally to pieces.
[02:44:02.154 --> 02:44:09.739]  And our job is basically to pick up as much as possible antibody and take it out of the residence or wherever it's at.
[02:44:10.499 --> 02:44:18.964]  And a handgun, of course, is going to make a hole too, but there's no way there's going to be time to pull the trigger a second time.
[02:44:20.987 --> 02:44:32.929]  Well, since you've seen people shot in the head with .30-06s, which JFK was 41 years ago, the hole where the bullet goes in, that's the little hole, and the hole where the bullet comes out, that's the big hole.
[02:44:32.969 --> 02:44:33.809]  Is that what you've seen?
[02:44:33.829 --> 02:44:37.070]  Oh, there wasn't much left of this guy's head.
[02:44:37.110 --> 02:44:44.991]  He was like, it was right in front, the arrow was right in front of his face when he did it, and pretty much there wasn't much to look at.
[02:44:45.632 --> 02:44:47.812]  But there was a little hole in the front where it went in, though.
[02:44:48.482 --> 02:44:49.302]  There was no front.
[02:44:49.362 --> 02:44:50.463]  It was just totally gone.
[02:44:50.483 --> 02:44:51.543]  The whole front was gone.
[02:44:53.124 --> 02:44:55.745]  He shot himself in the front of the head, and the whole front of the head was gone?
[02:44:55.945 --> 02:44:58.146]  Yeah, I don't know if it was from underneath or what.
[02:44:58.626 --> 02:44:59.787]  Yeah, underneath does that.
[02:44:59.807 --> 02:45:14.473]  No, I've shot a lot of wild boar and a lot of deer in the head, and when you shoot something in the head with a .30-06, it's a tiny hole, and the hole, or whatever other side it goes out, is usually about four inches wide and blows the brains out.
[02:45:14.533 --> 02:45:15.134]  Thanks for the call.
[02:45:15.254 --> 02:45:15.574]  You're welcome.
[02:45:16.074 --> 02:45:16.854]  Yeah, I appreciate it.
[02:45:16.895 --> 02:45:17.875]  Yeah, no, that's what happens.
[02:45:17.895 --> 02:45:24.198]  The media has kind of let us know how to commit suicide out there with all these advertisements for it in the movies.
[02:45:24.738 --> 02:45:31.320]  And, yeah, that's the way that people do it is put it in the mouth, up under the soft palate, and shoot up into the brain that way or under the chin.
[02:45:31.340 --> 02:45:36.703]  And, yeah, then it blows the whole top of the head off and the face off like a mushroom cloud.
[02:45:36.723 --> 02:45:39.644]  I don't want to get too detailed here, but they're killing people left and right.
[02:45:40.899 --> 02:45:41.699]  So we've got to talk about it.
[02:45:42.340 --> 02:45:43.400]  I've got some news I want to cover.
[02:45:43.420 --> 02:45:45.041]  Let's keep hurrying through these.
[02:45:45.621 --> 02:45:46.962]  Myron in South Dakota.
[02:45:46.982 --> 02:45:47.682]  Go ahead, Myron.
[02:45:47.982 --> 02:45:48.463]  Yes, Alex.
[02:45:48.963 --> 02:45:54.826]  I thought you were aware of the Oklahoma City bombing program being on the History Channel.
[02:45:54.846 --> 02:45:57.227]  Hey, I'm not kidding when I say I don't watch much TV.
[02:45:58.027 --> 02:45:59.668]  I thought somebody would have called in.
[02:45:59.708 --> 02:46:03.750]  I haven't heard all your programs this last week, or I would have called in and talked about it.
[02:46:04.430 --> 02:46:07.312]  They're going to re-air it again Saturday at 6 p.m.
[02:46:08.312 --> 02:46:09.533]  this coming Saturday, the 18th.
[02:46:10.851 --> 02:46:15.892]  So I think if you wanted to catch it... The problem is I'll be working on a film at that time.
[02:46:17.492 --> 02:46:24.353]  I'm going to try to catch TV tonight to catch Bush's party and, quote, celebration over signing the new National ID Card Patriot Act.
[02:46:24.373 --> 02:46:26.314]  You want me to mail you a DVD on it?
[02:46:27.674 --> 02:46:28.094]  Yeah.
[02:46:28.654 --> 02:46:29.734]  Look, I need listeners.
[02:46:29.814 --> 02:46:32.095]  Key stuff, I need it labeled and mailed to me.
[02:46:32.335 --> 02:46:33.275]  You can really help me.
[02:46:33.715 --> 02:46:33.935]  Okay.
[02:46:34.835 --> 02:46:36.736]  I think Ken did a misrepresentation.
[02:46:36.756 --> 02:46:38.256]  I thought it was an excellent program.
[02:46:38.806 --> 02:46:46.494]  They had two former FBI agents who no longer worked for the FBI and they were questioning what they contended was a complete cover-up.
[02:46:47.275 --> 02:46:56.225]  And there was Bill Jasper, who you discussed earlier, and he connected the connection to the Bin Laden family or the Al-Qaeda, the Philippine connection.
[02:46:57.578 --> 02:46:58.679]  Project Bojinka.
[02:46:59.019 --> 02:46:59.259]  Right.
[02:46:59.860 --> 02:47:02.323]  But that's not... It was a government op.
[02:47:02.363 --> 02:47:04.304]  The Arabs were protected by the police.
[02:47:04.345 --> 02:47:05.305]  They worked for the U.S.
[02:47:05.326 --> 02:47:05.706]  government.
[02:47:06.206 --> 02:47:06.947]  I understand that.
[02:47:06.987 --> 02:47:08.088]  It seems like a good report.
[02:47:08.148 --> 02:47:09.470]  Look, I predicted two years ago.
[02:47:09.590 --> 02:47:09.950]  J.D.
[02:47:10.030 --> 02:47:10.451]  Cash...
[02:47:11.801 --> 02:47:17.664]  He discussed Elohim City, Carol Howe, Andrew Strassmeyer, and Stephen Jones.
[02:47:17.804 --> 02:47:25.327]  He presented a lot of evidence that he had collected showing that there was a... Hey, why didn't Stephen Jones ask for the surveillance camera tapes?
[02:47:25.607 --> 02:47:31.310]  Because that would have convicted his client right there on the spot.
[02:47:31.350 --> 02:47:33.411]  Why didn't the feds use it?
[02:47:33.551 --> 02:47:34.511]  But Nichols did.
[02:47:34.531 --> 02:47:39.914]  Nichols, they got a Secret Service agent on the stand.
[02:47:41.224 --> 02:47:47.693]  And he contended there were surveillance tapes, but then the prosecution came back and stated, well, we have none.
[02:47:47.754 --> 02:47:50.477]  Yeah, why would the prosecution not want that seen?
[02:47:50.518 --> 02:47:52.540]  Because we know the names of those Iraqis.
[02:47:52.881 --> 02:47:53.862]  They work for the U.S.
[02:47:53.902 --> 02:47:54.263]  government.
[02:47:54.853 --> 02:47:57.914]  Lenny, I think after you look at it, you won't be so harsh.
[02:47:58.294 --> 02:47:59.655]  I thought they did an excellent job.
[02:47:59.695 --> 02:48:01.035]  See, that's what good propaganda does.
[02:48:01.115 --> 02:48:05.777]  It's 90% the truth, but then, oh, the answer is the evil militia works with Al-Qaeda.
[02:48:05.837 --> 02:48:06.377]  No, no, no.
[02:48:06.397 --> 02:48:16.601]  They brought out the point that these people are also financed by Arafat and Gaddafi and some of the... It's not true.
[02:48:16.621 --> 02:48:17.101]  Huh?
[02:48:17.441 --> 02:48:20.662]  Listen, I love you to death, Myron, but listen to me carefully.
[02:48:21.770 --> 02:48:23.732]  We know the names of the Iraqis.
[02:48:23.772 --> 02:48:25.314]  I've had police detectives on.
[02:48:25.754 --> 02:48:26.855]  We have video of them.
[02:48:27.156 --> 02:48:28.998]  They worked for the CIA.
[02:48:29.318 --> 02:48:30.639]  They didn't work for Arafat.
[02:48:32.341 --> 02:48:37.887]  Do you see what I'm... By admitting there were more people there, you've got to ask the question, why didn't the government go after them?
[02:48:38.287 --> 02:48:39.428]  Because they worked for them.
[02:48:40.049 --> 02:48:40.750]  But good points.
[02:48:40.830 --> 02:48:41.330]  I want to see it.
[02:48:41.350 --> 02:48:41.791]  Send it to me.
[02:48:42.111 --> 02:48:42.612]  We'll be back.
[02:48:43.823 --> 02:48:48.149]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:48.349 --> 02:48:52.755]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:52.915 --> 02:48:57.301]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:48:57.462 --> 02:48:58.663]  A New World Order.
[02:49:00.465 --> 02:49:04.689]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:04.749 --> 02:49:11.675]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:11.815 --> 02:49:13.877]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:14.177 --> 02:49:24.526]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:24.826 --> 02:49:26.948]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is...
[02:49:27.148 --> 02:49:30.190]  Then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[02:49:30.691 --> 02:49:33.313]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[02:49:43.240 --> 02:49:50.762]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:49:51.022 --> 02:50:01.945]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:50:02.205 --> 02:50:02.445]  I think.
[02:50:23.891 --> 02:50:26.492]  For the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:50:26.772 --> 02:50:35.514]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:35.574 --> 02:50:36.034]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.

[02:51:48.522 --> 02:51:50.425]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:51:50.926 --> 02:51:53.731]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:55.955 --> 02:51:57.998]  All right, folks, this is Festus.
[02:51:59.113 --> 02:52:00.814]  Taking over for Alex right now.
[02:52:00.834 --> 02:52:03.335]  We're going to talk to Kitty in Texas.
[02:52:03.695 --> 02:52:05.556]  Kitty, how's Matt Dillon doing?
[02:52:06.496 --> 02:52:08.777]  Just fine, just fine.
[02:52:08.797 --> 02:52:10.438]  Oh, boy.
[02:52:10.898 --> 02:52:13.520]  I'm so ecstatic and thrilled to be able to get through to you.
[02:52:13.780 --> 02:52:14.640]  Well, I'm good to have you on.
[02:52:14.660 --> 02:52:15.661]  We're almost out of time, though.
[02:52:15.681 --> 02:52:16.241]  Tell me what you're doing.
[02:52:16.261 --> 02:52:16.841]  Okay, I'll be real quick.
[02:52:19.042 --> 02:52:23.164]  I called about a tape in Washington, D.C., and I was given a number.
[02:52:23.737 --> 02:52:32.761]  To contact another person, and I didn't know who I was talking to, but it turned out to be, as we spoke for about an hour, Anthony Hilder?
[02:52:32.781 --> 02:52:34.802]  Anthony Hilder.
[02:52:34.842 --> 02:52:36.163]  Hilder, I'm sorry, Hilder, yes.
[02:52:36.603 --> 02:52:37.523]  Anthony Hilder, yes.
[02:52:37.603 --> 02:52:37.983]  Yes.
[02:52:38.123 --> 02:52:40.605]  It's Anthony Hilder, not... Yeah, not Hilder.
[02:52:41.785 --> 02:52:42.145]  Hilder.
[02:52:42.725 --> 02:52:51.009]  And we talked on great length about you and all your videos, and oh my gosh, he just, he's ecstatic.
[02:52:51.049 --> 02:52:52.610]  He just thinks the world of you.
[02:52:53.345 --> 02:52:54.386]  Well, Anthony's a great guy.
[02:52:54.486 --> 02:52:55.387]  It hasn't been on the market.
[02:52:55.407 --> 02:52:56.167]  And I'm the first to order it.
[02:52:56.207 --> 02:52:57.088]  It's called the Illuminati.
[02:52:57.148 --> 02:52:58.049]  Have you heard about it?
[02:53:13.442 --> 02:53:18.789]  Well, I know we had Illuminazi about 9-11, and then we have on the website 9-11, the greatest lie ever sold.
[02:53:19.069 --> 02:53:21.152]  You can watch that at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:53:21.472 --> 02:53:29.382]  Okay, the greatest lie ever sold is the one I didn't get, and he's going to send it to me because someone broke into his van or his vehicle...
[02:53:30.117 --> 02:53:35.480]  And opened the envelope, and one of the packages were meant to come to me, and they stole all his tapes.
[02:53:35.720 --> 02:53:36.540]  Oh, that's horrible.
[02:53:36.900 --> 02:53:44.264]  Yeah, he was enlightened, and he was ecstatic that I called, because we ended up in a long, drawn-out conversation.
[02:53:44.884 --> 02:53:55.289]  And he will get his tape out to me, but he did say the new tape or DVD is on disc, and it's called Illuminati.
[02:53:55.717 --> 02:54:02.401]  All right, listen, unfortunately, Kitty, we can't have a long, drawn-out talk because I'm out of time, but have a great holiday.
[02:54:02.661 --> 02:54:05.923]  Okay, you have a wonderful Christmas and your family as well.
[02:54:05.983 --> 02:54:06.883]  Happy New Year.
[02:54:06.923 --> 02:54:08.564]  God bless you, all of you.
[02:54:08.744 --> 02:54:09.205]  You too.
[02:54:09.225 --> 02:54:09.505]  Bye.
[02:54:09.825 --> 02:54:09.985]  Bye.
[02:54:10.025 --> 02:54:10.946]  Good talking to you, Kitty.
[02:54:11.346 --> 02:54:14.748]  She's a nice lady, so I was having fun joking around like Fessus.
[02:54:15.949 --> 02:54:19.171]  Now, Gunsmoke, the show folks, having a little fun here.
[02:54:19.771 --> 02:54:20.692]  I've got to have a little fun.
[02:54:21.012 --> 02:54:25.155]  Lord Bush, here in a few hours, we're going to have a White House celebration.
[02:54:25.735 --> 02:54:32.420]  That's DCNBC reporting on that, as well as the Associated Press, to give you your new national ID card and much more.
[02:54:33.641 --> 02:54:43.808]  And USA Today came out, and now that they've already passed it, Bush is going to sign it and say, yes, it's your national ID card, but it's for your safety and the illegal aliens' safety.
[02:54:44.646 --> 02:54:48.627]  They get a waiver where they don't have to do it.
[02:54:48.687 --> 02:54:50.588]  So it also is a form of amnesty.
[02:54:50.668 --> 02:54:52.368]  So that'll keep you safe.
[02:54:52.428 --> 02:54:58.750]  Isn't that just wonderful that they've done this for you?
[02:55:00.731 --> 02:55:04.712]  And Christians face 47 years in prison for reading Bible, praying on street.
[02:55:04.732 --> 02:55:06.093]  We'll talk to them next Monday.
[02:55:06.893 --> 02:55:10.634]  And after a federal appeals court denied an emergency appeal to stop
[02:55:11.590 --> 02:55:13.552]  Prosecution of 11 Christians on Tuesday.
[02:55:13.612 --> 02:55:22.322]  Philadelphia Municipal Court Judge William Austin Meehan ordered four of the Christians to stand trial on three felony criminal conspiracy ethnic intimidation.
[02:55:23.154 --> 02:55:23.935]  We're good to go.
[02:55:43.018 --> 02:55:45.780]  And Pennsylvania passed a law where a preacher can be arrested.
[02:55:46.280 --> 02:55:48.141]  Are we all just going to be cowed by this?
[02:55:48.161 --> 02:55:50.662]  Are we going to let the First Amendment disappear?
[02:55:51.082 --> 02:55:57.826]  Whether it's an anti-war activist getting arrested and charged with a felony for standing on the street corner or people reading out of the Bible.
[02:55:58.306 --> 02:55:59.347]  Come on, people!
[02:55:59.367 --> 02:56:00.628]  This isn't America!
[02:56:01.668 --> 02:56:04.930]  The answer is all of us have got to stand up and speak out against this.
[02:56:07.881 --> 02:56:13.405]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order via the secure online shopping cart any of my films.

[02:56:22.451 --> 02:56:24.312]  You order now, you'll get them in time for Christmas.
[02:56:24.332 --> 02:56:26.894]  1-888-253-3139 is the toll-free number to order.
[02:56:26.954 --> 02:56:28.095]  Have a great day.
