[00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:06.349]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:08.069]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.890]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.370]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.010]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.331]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:21.992]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.253 --> 00:00:27.853]  Boy, I feel like a time has really flown by.
[00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:32.974]  Four years ago today,
[00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:35.334]  The 15th day of July 2000.
[00:00:35.974 --> 00:00:39.255]  Now it's the 15th day of July 2004.
[00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:48.717]  I snuck into the Bohemian Grove in Northern California.
[00:00:48.777 --> 00:00:53.937]  The first time anyone had ever successfully done that and gotten images, video out.
[00:00:56.018 --> 00:00:58.378]  And world leaders right now are there.
[00:00:58.398 --> 00:01:02.279]  And this evening, once the sun sets,
[00:01:03.294 --> 00:01:11.578]  In Northern California, they will engage for the hundredth and thirty-second time in their satanic ritual.
[00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:21.282]  So, I figured, you know, it's about an eight-page article I wrote when I got back from Bohemian Grove back in 2000.
[00:01:21.322 --> 00:01:28.065]  I figured I should just read that on air in the interest of time to try to keep it focused and just cover the facts.
[00:01:29.801 --> 00:01:32.524]  And so that's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:01:32.584 --> 00:01:36.527]  I'm going to read that in its entirety here on air.
[00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:43.393]  In the meantime, a tiny chip takes on a big job.
[00:01:43.413 --> 00:01:51.301]  This out of the Associated Press, telling us how wonderful it is
[00:01:54.332 --> 00:01:56.432]  It's an area of high security.
[00:01:56.512 --> 00:02:03.114]  It's necessary that we have access to this through a chip, which, what's more, is unremovable.
[00:02:03.774 --> 00:02:19.817]  The Attorney General of Mexico told reporters, the chips operating on high frequency radio signals will be used to identify the few prosecutors, 160 of them have already got it, with access to the crime database and sophisticated communication systems.
[00:02:22.463 --> 00:02:28.784]  So they can't get into the new area of the Justice Ministry if they don't have this.
[00:02:29.104 --> 00:02:35.485]  And other governments are saying they're going to make their militaries and their government employees take it.
[00:02:37.165 --> 00:02:46.747]  A few months ago, the mainstream news was discussing major police departments in Florida debating making police officers take microchips in their hands.
[00:02:47.987 --> 00:02:51.668]  Then the gun wouldn't fire unless it was their gun.
[00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.931]  And so I said, they're going to make the enforcers take it first.
[00:02:56.851 --> 00:02:58.472]  They're going to say, hey, what's your problem?
[00:02:58.552 --> 00:02:59.572]  I had to take the chip.
[00:03:01.453 --> 00:03:04.794]  And they'll say, hey, if you want to go in this business or this company, you've got to have a chip.
[00:03:06.835 --> 00:03:10.936]  And simultaneously, the face scanners are going in the grocery stores, the thumb scanners.
[00:03:10.976 --> 00:03:13.497]  It's all falling into place.
[00:03:13.557 --> 00:03:19.999]  And it's so Orwellian, such a Brave New World, Twilight Zone situation.
[00:03:25.905 --> 00:03:29.507]  Here's another one of the headlines from the Associated Press.
[00:03:30.087 --> 00:03:32.909]  Ship implanted in Mexico, judicial workers.
[00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.211]  And they say that's only the beginning.
[00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:38.913]  Communist China says they're going to do it.
[00:03:39.853 --> 00:03:41.394]  They're going to make prisoners take it.
[00:03:41.434 --> 00:03:44.416]  The Bureau of Prisons in California has already ordered them.
[00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:50.093]  Chip implant in Mexico judicial workers.
[00:03:50.554 --> 00:03:57.198]  Security has reached the subcutaneous level for Mexico's Attorney General and at least 160 people in his office.
[00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.182]  They have been implanted with microchips that get them access to secure areas of their headquarters.
[00:04:04.223 --> 00:04:09.587]  It's a pioneering application for a technology that is widely used in animals but not in humans.
[00:04:11.553 --> 00:04:20.336]  You know, if I had the staff and the time, we've got interviews posted in the audio section of PrisonPlanet.com from two, three years ago.
[00:04:22.677 --> 00:04:26.458]  Where I had the CEO of Applied Digital on, I had their Chief Scientist on.
[00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:34.041]  And I would read from their press releases, you plan to put this under the skin for people to buy and sell, to have jobs, to be in security.
[00:04:35.221 --> 00:04:37.462]  Oh no, we're never going to do that, because they were under heat at the time.
[00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.073]  And then their own documents said they were planning to do it and now here they are doing it.
[00:04:44.514 --> 00:04:47.477]  Just to expose what a pack of liars these people are.
[00:04:48.458 --> 00:04:52.301]  So now we're calmly talking about having to have a chip to have a job.
[00:04:53.402 --> 00:04:53.822]  It's 2004.
[00:04:53.862 --> 00:04:55.784]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:08.441]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:08.862 --> 00:05:13.104]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:13.344 --> 00:05:20.368]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:26.852]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:26.992 --> 00:05:28.213]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:28.553 --> 00:05:31.495]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:05:31.655 --> 00:05:33.677]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:05:33.997 --> 00:05:41.222]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:05:41.522 --> 00:05:44.905]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[00:06:00.552 --> 00:06:02.173]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:02.313 --> 00:06:06.396]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:06:06.556 --> 00:06:09.418]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:09.518 --> 00:06:16.243]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:16.423 --> 00:06:19.425]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:06:19.625 --> 00:06:22.007]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:22.147 --> 00:06:26.850]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:41.614]  Dry Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are extracted.
[00:06:41.774 --> 00:06:48.256]  Supercharge your Gravity Filter today, and order a 2-Pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96, or a 4-Pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-9000.
[00:06:53.317 --> 00:07:04.160]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.761]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:13.302]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:07:13.342 --> 00:07:14.682]  The New World Order.
[00:07:15.442 --> 00:07:16.243]  Panama.
[00:07:16.463 --> 00:07:17.224]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:40.645]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:07:40.805 --> 00:07:46.168]  If you want to understand what the new old order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:07:51.151 --> 00:07:52.872]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:08:01.346 --> 00:08:06.968]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:22.335]  Alright, my friends, it is the fourth anniversary of our infiltration of the Bohemian Grove, and right now, world leaders are preparing to worship their Canaanite deity in Northern California.
[00:08:22.355 --> 00:08:24.456]  So we'll go over that, but
[00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:28.747]  I've got all this really, really important news here.
[00:08:29.128 --> 00:08:38.035]  Florida Citizens to Help Catch Terrorists, Fox News, and of course last week they were saying it was going to be the firefighters and utility people.
[00:08:38.675 --> 00:08:40.857]  Now it's going to be anyone and everyone.
[00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:45.961]  Apartment managers, exterminators, repairmen, everyone!
[00:08:47.943 --> 00:08:49.564]  And the TIPS program was never canceled.
[00:08:49.624 --> 00:08:53.207]  It had its name changed, and this is federally funded down at the state level.
[00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:56.994]  And it's just totally un-American.
[00:08:57.034 --> 00:08:59.514]  Florida citizens to help catch terrorists.
[00:08:59.554 --> 00:09:01.175]  And again, that's the headline.
[00:09:01.615 --> 00:09:04.976]  Then you read into the article, it's to fight terrorists and crime.
[00:09:05.456 --> 00:09:08.316]  Homeland Security to fight terrorists and crime.
[00:09:08.676 --> 00:09:10.177]  Crime undermines the state.
[00:09:10.577 --> 00:09:16.838]  And that helps Al-Qaeda, so if we think you might be involved in crime, you're stripped of all your freedoms and liberties.
[00:09:18.359 --> 00:09:22.140]  And if you try to expose government corruption, we'll charge you with the Patriot Act, too.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.080]  You know, that's in there.
[00:09:24.702 --> 00:09:26.583]  And it says law enforcement officials.
[00:09:26.643 --> 00:09:27.584]  They're the officials.
[00:09:27.624 --> 00:09:28.504]  They're the authorities.
[00:09:28.524 --> 00:09:29.465]  They're not servants.
[00:09:29.545 --> 00:09:43.953]  See, law enforcement officials in Central Florida are planning to train table repairmen, exterminators, apartment managers, and others to report signs of terrorism inside their clients' homes.
[00:09:44.974 --> 00:09:50.777]  Of course, we have a copy of the press release by the law enforcement body there in Florida, and it says crime.
[00:09:50.797 --> 00:09:53.859]  That was in the Associated Press last week when we first covered this.
[00:09:54.463 --> 00:09:59.387]  Supporters of the program say making private citizens the eyes and ears of the police will save lives.
[00:09:59.467 --> 00:10:05.352]  But opponents at the ACLU say the plan is un-American and say it is a violation of privacy.
[00:10:05.713 --> 00:10:07.294]  Well, I mean, the Russians did it.
[00:10:07.414 --> 00:10:07.915]  Hitler did it.
[00:10:07.955 --> 00:10:08.515]  It must be good.
[00:10:08.555 --> 00:10:09.356]  They do it in China.
[00:10:09.376 --> 00:10:10.037]  Fidel does it.
[00:10:10.957 --> 00:10:17.683]  Operation Tips, a similar program proposed by President Bush, was withdrawn in 2002.
[00:10:17.803 --> 00:10:18.964]  That's not true, by the way.
[00:10:19.505 --> 00:10:22.187]  After critics said it would lead to racial profiling.
[00:10:23.487 --> 00:10:24.248]  Can't have that.
[00:10:24.428 --> 00:10:31.872]  So far, 5,000 brochures detailing the Florida plan have been printed, and volunteers will be trained for what to look for.
[00:10:32.453 --> 00:10:39.577]  But Orange County officials stress that people who go through the training will be encouraged to only report what they see, not search for evidence.
[00:10:41.098 --> 00:10:43.720]  And again, we've got the press release.
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.700]  We read it last week.
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:45.901]  It's all crime.
[00:10:49.199 --> 00:11:07.054]  And I've had friends, you know, who were in college years ago, who were taking a botany class and had some orchids growing and big flowers in their bedroom and the carpet man, and in that case it was a carpet person too, just very interesting.
[00:11:07.575 --> 00:11:10.017]  They raise a lot of extra money, a lot of extra cash.
[00:11:10.758 --> 00:11:14.601]  Better than the 12 bucks an hour I guess they get gouging you to clean your carpet.
[00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:18.320]  But, uh, they, uh, called the, uh, police on them.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.401]  They got a SWAT team visit and did ransack it.
[00:11:21.441 --> 00:11:22.662]  And then say, okay, bye-bye.
[00:11:24.043 --> 00:11:25.383]  Nice, uh, orchids.
[00:11:25.903 --> 00:11:28.644]  But, uh, evil orchids.
[00:11:28.985 --> 00:11:31.806]  These idiots don't know what an orchid is compared to marijuana.
[00:11:32.306 --> 00:11:33.286]  Mary Jane.
[00:11:34.407 --> 00:11:37.088]  And, of course, I've told you the story of the carpet cleaner in my house.
[00:11:37.148 --> 00:11:39.789]  Seeing a shotgun you could buy anywhere on the wall.
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:45.464]  And wanting to call the police on me and I barely stopped that from happening.
[00:11:48.346 --> 00:11:51.128]  So, now this is going on nationwide.
[00:11:53.289 --> 00:11:58.053]  So that's the kind of articles I've got here that we really should cover and go over.
[00:11:58.753 --> 00:11:59.253]  By the way,
[00:12:01.292 --> 00:12:13.858]  In one particular city, hundreds of people found that if they put their driver's license and credit card readers at gas stations, and I've talked about this before, that it will authorize the gas pump.
[00:12:15.859 --> 00:12:23.142]  And of course, the fools didn't know that it also recorded your social security number through your driver's license number, everything about you.
[00:12:25.118 --> 00:12:31.520]  And you see the truth buried in news articles like this because they're arresting hundreds of people now who did this.
[00:12:32.321 --> 00:12:35.482]  Word just spread that this would work.
[00:12:35.722 --> 00:12:36.822]  And why do you think it would work?
[00:12:36.882 --> 00:12:52.508]  Because since the early 90s, almost every state, last time I was 42, I'm told it's the other 8 now, take the thumbprint of the digital scan and have the federally mandated driver's license with the magnetic strip on the back,
[00:12:53.733 --> 00:12:55.435]  And it's all being standardized.
[00:12:55.495 --> 00:12:58.658]  That'll be your national ID card for the new national sales tax.
[00:12:58.718 --> 00:13:02.521]  And it'll still have your state's brand name on it, but it's really already federal.
[00:13:03.502 --> 00:13:09.848]  And I have a AP article, and another article as well, too, on this subject.
[00:13:11.069 --> 00:13:14.713]  All over the country now, people are finding they can stick their driver's license in.
[00:13:15.113 --> 00:13:16.594]  Now, not yet, folks.
[00:13:17.295 --> 00:13:19.097]  You'll have to pay once it's time.
[00:13:20.658 --> 00:13:31.441]  You know, once there's another terror attack and they announce that these are our national ID cards and the new national sales tax, then it'll all be attached to your mandatory bank account.
[00:13:31.461 --> 00:13:33.381]  You'll have to have a bank account.
[00:13:35.122 --> 00:13:36.002]  This has been announced.
[00:13:36.702 --> 00:13:39.843]  This is in the latter planning stages.
[00:13:39.923 --> 00:13:40.983]  The infrastructure's been put in.
[00:13:41.932 --> 00:13:48.339]  And your check will have to be automatically transferred, most companies already pressure you to do this, into your bank account.
[00:13:48.379 --> 00:13:51.642]  And to live, you'll have to have a bank account with the government attached to it.
[00:13:51.682 --> 00:13:55.846]  And we'll all just get trained to have our money taken out instantly as we pay for things.
[00:13:57.468 --> 00:14:03.514]  And have the new national sales tax shared with the locals who will enforce it and hence become federalized through it.
[00:14:05.225 --> 00:14:07.906]  I'm just getting ready for my new life here in Austin.
[00:14:07.926 --> 00:14:10.567]  I won't be able to drive anywhere without getting on a toll road.
[00:14:10.847 --> 00:14:12.648]  No more than five miles without getting on a toll road.
[00:14:13.288 --> 00:14:15.649]  Well, no more than a quarter mile from my house to get on one.
[00:14:15.669 --> 00:14:17.970]  But for most people, you can't go five miles without being on one.
[00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:20.451]  These will be checkpoints where they randomly search your vehicles.
[00:14:20.511 --> 00:14:20.952]  It's admitted.
[00:14:21.472 --> 00:14:22.672]  And it's going in nationwide.
[00:14:22.692 --> 00:14:24.313]  And I'll have to swipe my card to buy anything.
[00:14:24.333 --> 00:14:25.874]  I'll have to have a special bank account for that.
[00:14:27.014 --> 00:14:27.974]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[00:14:27.995 --> 00:14:29.655]  Everything we do is tracked and traced.
[00:14:30.576 --> 00:14:31.276]  But, yes.
[00:14:33.422 --> 00:14:35.444]  So, we'll go over that, too.
[00:14:36.184 --> 00:14:39.306]  But, oh, there's so much here.
[00:14:40.868 --> 00:14:52.976]  You know, a few years ago on the Weather Channel, they had an hour-long special program on the show called Atmospheres, but on that particular show, it was about how the U.S.
[00:14:52.996 --> 00:14:55.118]  government can control the weather with these
[00:14:59.076 --> 00:15:05.638]  Charging systems, these radio towers that charge the atmosphere and how they can cloud seed and spray.
[00:15:06.779 --> 00:15:09.140]  I don't know, six, seven years ago I sent articles for the Russians.
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:16.542]  You can pay them a million bucks and the Russian government will come to your parade anywhere in the world and guarantee the sky will be clear.
[00:15:17.983 --> 00:15:20.964]  But then the average yuppie says there's no such thing as weather control.
[00:15:20.984 --> 00:15:23.525]  This is out of the BBC.
[00:15:23.625 --> 00:15:26.486]  China ran rainmaking
[00:15:27.834 --> 00:15:30.837]  And it goes on, China rainmaking creates a storm.
[00:15:32.858 --> 00:15:40.985]  And it says, relations between neighboring Chinese cities have become stormy over the use of controversial technology which encourages rainfall.
[00:15:42.106 --> 00:15:48.511]  They had floods three years ago in South Texas that killed, I don't know, it was like 40 people in one night.
[00:15:48.991 --> 00:15:52.434]  And then there was a blurb out on the San Antonio paper
[00:15:53.163 --> 00:15:59.325]  That, oh, there was a Navy weather modification test going on, and these record storms formed instantly.
[00:16:00.506 --> 00:16:01.226]  But never mind.
[00:16:02.186 --> 00:16:06.908]  And it says, the method did bring rain in Henna, but not equally to all areas.
[00:16:06.968 --> 00:16:15.231]  Meteorological officials in one city accused neighboring colleagues of overusing the method, the paper said, and stealing their water.
[00:16:15.891 --> 00:16:21.353]  The five cities of Pindanghong, Zhongmangdang, Longhong,
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:44.655]  Zou Cheng and Zou Kou have all been suffering from drought but were finally blessed with rain as a result of cloud seeding on Saturday the China Daily reported however while Pin Hong Dashan received more than 100 millimeters of rainfall less than 30 millimeters fell for Zou Kou.
[00:16:45.795 --> 00:16:48.017]  One Zou Kou official accused
[00:16:48.678 --> 00:17:02.188]  The other province of intercepting clouds that would probably have drifted to other places, and it says they were still launching rockets to make rain when they already had rain falling, he is reported as saying.
[00:17:03.489 --> 00:17:14.757]  Cloud seeding is a long practice technology which uses rockets, planes, cannons, or ground generators to fire particles, usually silver iodine,
[00:17:15.555 --> 00:17:20.318]  Into clouds that encourage water vapor to gather around them and eventually fall as rain.
[00:17:21.959 --> 00:17:24.321]  Now that's the old 50's technology.
[00:17:26.662 --> 00:17:39.170]  Whenever we have droughts around here, you will see giant thunderstorms coming in and suddenly these white jets show up and fly in front of them at 4,000-5,000 feet and spray out their trails and blocks it.
[00:17:40.939 --> 00:17:49.084]  NASA admits the Earth is 20% darker now because of the trails from jets that weren't there just a few years ago, seven, eight years ago, when all this stuff started accelerating.
[00:17:52.466 --> 00:17:57.969]  But, um, shifting years yet again, who ever thought?
[00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.131]  Who ever thought?
[00:18:01.151 --> 00:18:07.175]  I mean, I remember, many years ago, feeling like a weirdo when I was about to read a government document on air,
[00:18:08.334 --> 00:18:13.896]  I'm going, folks, it's on the website, or folks, you can go to the library and read this, even before I had a website in 98.
[00:18:15.617 --> 00:18:24.761]  There is a plan through FAD, through security, through not being able to have a job if you don't have it, to have implantable microchips.
[00:18:27.762 --> 00:18:31.123]  And everything we cover, oh, I'd say 95%, is documented.
[00:18:31.183 --> 00:18:35.025]  It's stuff we can totally prove, and we occasionally connect the dots and speculate a bit.
[00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:40.792]  But clearly point out, well we're speculating, but none of this was speculation.
[00:18:40.812 --> 00:18:47.794]  I mean, I would read three, four years ago the corporate documents of these companies saying they're going to make us take it, we're all going to have it, ha ha ha.
[00:18:48.855 --> 00:18:53.977]  They've got all these weird occult names for it, the Babylon System, the Digital Angel.
[00:18:56.298 --> 00:18:57.158]  It goes on and on.
[00:18:59.183 --> 00:19:06.506]  And now, I mean, what, three months ago, I had the Baja Beach Club manager, CEO, whatever, on.
[00:19:08.546 --> 00:19:21.971]  And he's like, oh yes, I'm a distributor for Applied Digital, the implantable chip maker, and we're gonna, government people are gonna have to take it, police are gonna have to take it, and I see a time when you'll have to have it to buy and sell, I think it's great, the chip will prevail, he said.
[00:19:22.431 --> 00:19:23.992]  Weird war talk.
[00:19:25.194 --> 00:19:29.936]  Well, the Mexican Attorney General is saying the same thing, and if you want to work in the headquarters, you've got to have it.
[00:19:30.597 --> 00:19:35.379]  And all 160 just got it two days ago, and now here's the newest AP article.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.560]  Others are going to have to have it.
[00:19:39.201 --> 00:19:44.684]  And there's discussions in Florida of making the police take it.
[00:19:44.764 --> 00:19:46.825]  I mean, we're openly, now we're to that point.
[00:19:46.865 --> 00:19:47.525]  See, it's happening.
[00:19:50.478 --> 00:19:53.160]  We'll be right back and get more into this and just a bunch of other news.
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:56.943]  I'll also cover Bohemian Grove, the fourth year anniversary of my infiltration.
[00:19:56.963 --> 00:19:59.465]  Stay with us.
[00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:11.073]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.

[00:23:01.241 --> 00:23:02.222]  Spring has arrived!
[00:23:02.402 --> 00:23:05.365]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:23:05.605 --> 00:23:09.048]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:23:09.268 --> 00:23:17.415]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:23:17.695 --> 00:23:21.418]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.

[00:24:01.284 --> 00:24:06.425]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:07.105 --> 00:24:09.406]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:34.972]  So, we're sitting here calmly discussing, if you want to work in the justice ministry, in the secure areas, you've got to have the microchip.
[00:24:36.773 --> 00:24:45.895]  And I remember about a year ago, my cousin, who's been in the military, I don't know, for 18 years, special forces, and now in more of the administrative side of things,
[00:24:48.348 --> 00:24:51.991]  Coming over to my house for coffee and going, you know, I'm sorry I made fun of you a few years ago.
[00:24:52.011 --> 00:24:52.932]  I remember when I did that.
[00:24:55.494 --> 00:24:58.336]  They told us we're all getting microchips in a meeting.
[00:24:59.317 --> 00:25:01.378]  In a big old conference room full of officers.
[00:25:02.299 --> 00:25:05.561]  The whole military will be getting microchips in the next two years.
[00:25:05.621 --> 00:25:06.642]  Now, that was a year ago.
[00:25:09.604 --> 00:25:12.747]  And now we've already got reports of some special forces getting the chips.
[00:25:13.027 --> 00:25:15.089]  But see, then it's if you want to work as a cop.
[00:25:15.129 --> 00:25:16.109]  You want to have a gun.
[00:25:16.169 --> 00:25:17.991]  You want to work in the prison.
[00:25:19.229 --> 00:25:20.829]  They're going to make the enforcers do it.
[00:25:20.849 --> 00:25:27.210]  And then I remember having the CEO and the top scientists and others from Applied Digital on.
[00:25:28.151 --> 00:25:31.391]  Years ago, they'd say, oh, there's no plan to satellite track.
[00:25:31.411 --> 00:25:33.011]  There's no plan to control this.
[00:25:33.031 --> 00:25:37.872]  There's no plan to... We've never proposed it, but they were getting a lot of heat on the subject.
[00:25:39.332 --> 00:25:42.173]  And I would go, but here's your own press release saying it.
[00:25:43.213 --> 00:25:44.933]  Oh, Mr. Jones, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[00:25:44.953 --> 00:25:48.074]  You know, one of them had like this Transylvanian accent, a scientist.
[00:25:49.355 --> 00:25:51.036]  Sounded like Count Dracula or something.
[00:25:51.976 --> 00:26:09.906]  And so I'm sitting here dealing with this and watching them prepare the public for this and Sean Hannity and Diane Sawyer and everybody else saying every child needs a chip across the political spectrum and then now they're pushing it, they're doing it.
[00:26:10.606 --> 00:26:14.068]  Chips implanted in Mexico's judicial workers
[00:26:15.237 --> 00:26:26.300]  Security has reached the subcutaneous level for Mexico's Attorney General, and at least 160 in his office, they have been implanted with microchips that give them access to secure areas of their headquarters.
[00:26:28.221 --> 00:26:30.081]  And if you want to work there, you have to have the chip.
[00:26:30.261 --> 00:26:35.223]  It's a pioneering application of the technology that is widely used in animals, but not in humans.
[00:26:36.255 --> 00:26:55.968]  Mexico's top federal prosecutors and investigators began receiving chip implants in their arms in November in order to get access to restricted areas inside the Attorney General's headquarters, said Antonio Aceves, General Director of the company that distributes the microchips in Mexico.
[00:26:56.348 --> 00:26:58.770]  And the company is Solacet.
[00:27:00.731 --> 00:27:05.354]  Attorney General Rafael Macedo del Concha
[00:27:06.423 --> 00:27:14.445]  And 160 of his employees were implanted at the cost of taxpayers at $150 for each rice grain sized chip.
[00:27:17.066 --> 00:27:31.049]  And it says that AP's Carlos Altamonero implanted with the Vera chip, so AP's got their reporters getting it, a microchip that is used to keep you safe.
[00:27:31.169 --> 00:27:34.470]  And it says more are scheduled to get tagged in coming months.
[00:27:35.296 --> 00:27:41.219]  And key members of the Mexican military, the police, and the office of President Vicente Fox might fall a suit.
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:46.122]  Fox's office did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
[00:27:47.163 --> 00:28:03.412]  A spokesman for Macedo de la Concha's office said she could not comment on the statement citing security concerns, but Macedo himself mentioned the CHIP program to reporters Monday, saying he had received an implant in his arm,
[00:28:05.194 --> 00:28:10.958]  He said the chips were required to enter the new Federal Anti-Crime Information Center.
[00:28:11.719 --> 00:28:13.580]  It's only for access for security, he said.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:20.626]  The chips also could provide more certainty about who access sensitive data at any given time.
[00:28:20.666 --> 00:28:27.311]  In the past, the biggest security problem for Mexican law enforcement has been corruption by officials themselves.
[00:28:27.911 --> 00:28:31.894]  Yeah, the corrupt officials will use this to frame people to control it.
[00:28:31.954 --> 00:28:33.756]  I mean, this is just a Pandora's box.
[00:28:36.375 --> 00:28:43.759]  And the head of the company said they eventually hope to provide Mexican officials with implantable devices that can track their physical location anytime.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.621]  By the technology is still under development.
[00:28:48.042 --> 00:28:57.067]  And it says that the chips that have been implanted are manufactured by Verichip, a subsidiary of Applied Digital Solutions, a subsidiary of IBM, I would add.
[00:28:58.674 --> 00:29:07.558]  They lie dormant under the skin until read by an electromagnetic scanner, which uses a technology known as Radio Frequency Identification, or RFID.
[00:29:07.578 --> 00:29:09.478]  That's going in all the products, I would add.
[00:29:09.899 --> 00:29:13.080]  That's now getting hot in the inventory and supply chain business.
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:21.123]  Scott Silverman, Applied Digital Solutions Chief Executive, said each of his companies and plantable chips has a special identification number that would foil an imposter.
[00:29:23.354 --> 00:29:27.838]  And they go on to say that they plan to have it to where it's satellite tracked.
[00:29:27.859 --> 00:29:29.080]  Let me try to find that part.
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:40.451]  And it says that 1,000 Mexicans have been implanted with the CHIPSO farm, in addition to the CHIPSO of the government.
[00:29:41.312 --> 00:29:44.134]  I'm trying to find that quote where they say they're going to satellite track us all.
[00:29:44.535 --> 00:29:45.215]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:45.235 --> 00:29:45.616]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.535 --> 00:29:53.541]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.463 --> 00:29:57.128]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.481 --> 00:30:02.763]  The sun is getting brighter and the days are getting longer.
[00:30:02.963 --> 00:30:04.304]  Summer's just around the corner.
[00:30:04.504 --> 00:30:05.746]  What are your plans for it?
[00:30:06.046 --> 00:30:06.426]  Fishing?
[00:30:06.706 --> 00:30:07.147]  Gardening?
[00:30:07.207 --> 00:30:07.627]  Camping?
[00:30:07.827 --> 00:30:09.969]  I'm sure you'll spend more time enjoying the outdoors.
[00:30:10.189 --> 00:30:13.372]  And I'm sure the ticks and mosquitoes will spend more time enjoying you.
[00:30:13.592 --> 00:30:15.954]  It's not just itching and scratching we have to worry about.
[00:30:16.234 --> 00:30:19.597]  Now there's incurable illnesses like Lyme disease and the West Nile virus.
[00:30:19.958 --> 00:30:25.062]  Deet is proven to keep the bugs away, but it's also proven to cause brain damage in laboratory animals.
[00:30:25.402 --> 00:30:27.883]  That's not a choice I want to make, and I don't have to.
[00:30:28.063 --> 00:30:31.204]  Thanks to Natural Answer, available at NaturalAnswer.com.

[00:31:02.067 --> 00:31:12.773]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:13.153 --> 00:31:17.676]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:17.736 --> 00:31:29.082]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:29.662 --> 00:31:36.507]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:36.907 --> 00:31:39.049]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:31:39.549 --> 00:31:44.493]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[00:32:00.286 --> 00:32:01.707]  Somebody wants to sue you.

[00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:10.075]  Everything that you've worked hard for can be taken away from you as fast as you can say, frivolous lawsuit.
[00:32:10.175 --> 00:32:15.260]  Whether it's the IRS, a vindictive ex-spouse, or an average Joe off the street, don't let them have it.
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:19.904]  The Asset Protection Team can show you how to protect yourself from anybody that wants to sue you.

[00:32:34.732 --> 00:32:35.272]  Don't wait.
[00:32:35.433 --> 00:32:43.817]  Plan your strategy today before you encounter a lawsuit, bankruptcy, accident, judgment, lien, probate, creditor, medical crisis, malpractice, or worse.
[00:32:44.057 --> 00:32:52.221]  Plan today before you are confronted with a false claim, divorce, audit, state agency, federal agency, restraining order, an angry ex-partner, or worse.
[00:32:52.481 --> 00:32:55.023]  Visit AssetProtectionTeam.com or call 888-240-3337.
[00:33:11.872 --> 00:33:22.115]  Out of New York, it says, the chips operating on high frequency radio signals will be used to identify the few prosecutors with access to the crime database and sophisticated communication systems.
[00:33:22.875 --> 00:33:26.096]  Eventually, the chip will be married with satellite location technology.
[00:33:26.896 --> 00:33:27.957]  That's not true, folks.
[00:33:27.997 --> 00:33:39.860]  You can already, off a high-powered reader on a cell tower, scan you and then beam that up to satellite and give them a rough GPS bearing down to a few dozen feet.
[00:33:41.533 --> 00:33:43.374]  Well, they say 15 feet, not a few dozen.
[00:33:44.214 --> 00:34:00.479]  And then this other Associated Press article says they're going to make the police, government people take it, that a thousand Mexican private citizens already have the Applied Digital Solutions chip, and now 160 of the people that are allowed to get into the new Justice Center.
[00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:10.983]  And the Mr. Silverman of Applied Digital said his company has sold 7,000 chips to distributors across the United States,
[00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:15.411]  And that is more than a thousand of those had been inserted into U.S.
[00:34:15.451 --> 00:34:18.613]  customers, mostly for security or identification reasons.
[00:34:20.715 --> 00:34:22.756]  And they're doing this, and that's in the U.S.
[00:34:22.956 --> 00:34:26.839]  Oh, suddenly the CEO just pops up, and oh, a thousand Americans have got it!
[00:34:29.721 --> 00:34:30.521]  Oh my goodness.
[00:34:30.922 --> 00:34:34.344]  And the two princelings were given chips last year.
[00:34:36.105 --> 00:34:39.747]  But Prince Harry and Prince William got their microchips.
[00:34:39.787 --> 00:34:40.528]  It's such a
[00:34:41.354 --> 00:34:42.675]  It's a stylish thing.
[00:34:43.155 --> 00:34:45.077]  Only Hollywood people are getting it.
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:54.664]  And I predict, I've said this, within four years, your 14-year-old teenagers will be sneaking off.
[00:34:55.825 --> 00:34:59.168]  By the way, they're allowed to have abortions without your authorization because of this government.
[00:34:59.708 --> 00:35:04.772]  So they'll be sneaking off, if they can get that, to the tattoo parlors to get their microchips.
[00:35:05.292 --> 00:35:10.176]  And they're going to get 50% off into all the big theme parks and on products and
[00:35:11.892 --> 00:35:13.553]  Of course, no one will say it's discrimination.
[00:35:13.593 --> 00:35:22.956]  You know, you'll be lined up at the grocery store in, I'd say, six years, and folks will have the chip or the retina scan, and they're not refusing, and you're paying double.
[00:35:23.496 --> 00:35:26.837]  You'll go, OK, I've got to buy the food for my children.
[00:35:26.897 --> 00:35:28.257]  It's just too expensive without it.
[00:35:31.058 --> 00:35:32.179]  Go ahead and laugh at me.
[00:35:32.699 --> 00:35:33.159]  Go ahead.
[00:35:33.319 --> 00:35:33.879]  I understand.
[00:35:34.099 --> 00:35:34.620]  I understand.
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:35.440]  It's not going to happen.
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.921]  I'm making up these Associated Press articles.
[00:35:37.961 --> 00:35:38.541]  They don't exist.
[00:35:38.561 --> 00:35:38.981]  I understand.
[00:35:39.699 --> 00:35:42.601]  Or when you finally see it on the news, you'll suddenly say it's a wonderful thing and love it.
[00:35:44.323 --> 00:35:47.165]  I don't mean that towards all the listeners, but those that are in deep, deep denial.
[00:35:47.185 --> 00:35:51.769]  A few other news articles, then I'll get into my infiltration of Bohemian Grove.
[00:35:51.809 --> 00:35:56.052]  Today is the four-year anniversary of that.
[00:35:59.795 --> 00:36:04.439]  Talk about Adolf Hitler investigating Joseph Mingala.
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.222]  Or Jeffrey Dahmer investigating Ted Bundy.
[00:36:09.568 --> 00:36:15.672]  House members will discuss request to the United Nations to monitor U.S.
[00:36:15.812 --> 00:36:16.292]  election.
[00:36:18.814 --> 00:36:22.756]  And this is on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:36:26.038 --> 00:36:30.141]  And they're pointing out that there really is no voting in the U.S.
[00:36:30.161 --> 00:36:35.084]  and that it's been totally exposed to be a fraud with these electronic voting machines.
[00:36:37.933 --> 00:36:46.758]  And meanwhile, there's a state rule prohibiting manual recounts on touchscreen voting systems, and there's a lawsuit in Florida filed over that.
[00:36:47.258 --> 00:36:51.541]  Governments, federal and state, are moving to bar you from having a recount.
[00:36:52.321 --> 00:36:53.162]  Not allowing it!
[00:36:53.242 --> 00:36:54.262]  Oh, this is the new freedom!
[00:36:54.302 --> 00:37:00.105]  Not only are your systems a fraud provable, but you will arrest anyone trying to recount.
[00:37:00.245 --> 00:37:01.006]  It's very nice.
[00:37:01.784 --> 00:37:03.065]  And so the U.N.
[00:37:03.125 --> 00:37:05.728]  is going to come to our rescue, supposedly.
[00:37:06.229 --> 00:37:15.378]  The request by several members of the Congress to the United Nations to send observers, who of course will certify it, to monitor the upcoming presidential election has sparked interest around the globe.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:22.926]  At this juncture, a dozen House members have signed the letter to the United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan.
[00:37:23.826 --> 00:37:27.347]  Thursday morning, those members who have signed the U.N.
[00:37:27.387 --> 00:37:32.948]  letter will hold a news conference, which has now happened, on Capitol Hill to discuss the ramifications of the request.
[00:37:33.808 --> 00:37:46.770]  We're hoping that our action will accelerate the nation from the suffering it took in 2000, will alleviate the nation from the suffering it took in 2000 with things went awry at the ballot box.
[00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:47.950]  They didn't go awry, folks.
[00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:52.811]  Said Congresswoman Eddie Bertrice Johnson, who is
[00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:55.049]  spearheading the event.
[00:37:55.129 --> 00:37:58.810]  We're hoping our action will restore confidence in the electoral process.
[00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:04.432]  We're hoping that every registered person gets to vote and that the vote is counted.
[00:38:06.572 --> 00:38:07.152]  Oh, please.
[00:38:09.953 --> 00:38:12.034]  Okay, let's get into Bohemian Grove.
[00:38:12.314 --> 00:38:19.556]  I'm just going to, and I'm not a news reader, so please bear with me as I go over this.
[00:38:19.656 --> 00:38:20.516]  This is a little
[00:38:21.343 --> 00:38:24.565]  I just read into a tape recorder and then had it transcribed, basically.
[00:38:26.807 --> 00:38:31.850]  When I got back from the Bohemian Grove four years ago, and here is that story.
[00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:43.879]  You can look at photos, video clips, or order my film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.tv via the Safe, Secure Shopping Cart right now.
[00:38:47.041 --> 00:38:48.622]  Occult activities at the Bohemian
[00:38:49.716 --> 00:38:52.578]  The elite Bohemian Grove in Northern California exposed.
[00:38:52.658 --> 00:38:53.998]  Alex Jones tells his story.
[00:38:55.159 --> 00:39:10.507]  Last July, and again folks, this is four years ago now, documentary filmmaker Alex Jones infiltrated Bohemian Grove, becoming the first person to capture the bizarre occult activities of the all-male elite club members on videotape.
[00:39:10.547 --> 00:39:14.009]  The footage recently aired in England, Ireland, and Scotland on UK Channel 4.
[00:39:14.209 --> 00:39:15.670]  It's now aired in the US.
[00:39:16.909 --> 00:39:20.572]  It was part three of a four-part special, The Secret Rulers of the World.
[00:39:21.412 --> 00:39:32.079]  Alex Jones was inside the 2,700-acre elite compound for over five hours and states, thank God I caught the whole thing on videotape because no one would believe me if I hadn't.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:33.620]  I have trouble believing it.
[00:39:34.581 --> 00:39:37.523]  What I witnessed with my own two eyes, it was actually that bizarre.
[00:39:37.563 --> 00:39:38.063]  For over 128 years, now 132,
[00:39:41.044 --> 00:39:46.469]  World leaders have traveled to Sonoma County, California in the month of July almost immediately.
[00:39:46.889 --> 00:39:52.094]  Bizarre rumors began to circulate in the local press that something dark and occult was going on.
[00:39:52.794 --> 00:40:01.882]  The rumors entailed dark stories of men in black and red robes and a giant 40-foot stone owl to which something or someone was being sacrificed.
[00:40:02.745 --> 00:40:08.888]  Alex Jones, being a radio talk show host, had heard the rumors many times, so he decided to look into it and did some research.
[00:40:08.948 --> 00:40:19.294]  To his surprise, mainstream media articles from Parade Magazine to the Associated Press, Reuters, the Sacramento Bee, and the Washington Times confirmed the incredible.
[00:40:20.334 --> 00:40:27.118]  World leaders were traveling yearly to the rural redwood-covered hills of northern California.
[00:40:27.831 --> 00:40:33.233]  And photos actually existed of the giant stone owl and the men in black and red robes worshipping it.
[00:40:34.153 --> 00:40:41.335]  I was angered, Jones said, that in over 50 years there had been only a handful of news stories written on Bohemian Grove.
[00:40:42.396 --> 00:40:51.819]  And that these stories were commonly reported on the rumors and engaged in a whitewash, thus hiding a giant story in plain view.
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:57.643]  Reading about all the law enforcement and Secret Service protecting the Grove's mysteries.
[00:40:58.924 --> 00:41:06.729]  Every July, Jones took the challenge of John Ronson of World of Wonder Productions to blow Bohemian Grove wide open with his hidden cameras.
[00:41:07.789 --> 00:41:16.515]  After traveling from Austin, Texas to San Antonio, Jones and the other members of his team, Violet Nichols and Mike Hanson,
[00:41:17.615 --> 00:41:24.822]  Met up with the British filmmakers and began a three-day investigation before attempting to enter the Grove.
[00:41:26.004 --> 00:41:35.954]  On July 15, 2000, Alex Jones and Mike Hanson, equipped with two hidden video cameras and disguised as members of the Bohemian Club, successfully infiltrated the elite cult compound.
[00:41:36.554 --> 00:41:39.217]  One of the most commonly asked questions is, how did they get in?
[00:41:39.955 --> 00:41:47.822]  The following is a transcript of a taped interview with Alex Jones who described his infiltration of the super-secret Elitist camp and what he witnessed inside.
[00:41:49.023 --> 00:41:55.668]  The Bohemian Club lies within a large range of hills and cliffs with 300 to 400 foot drops.
[00:41:56.949 --> 00:42:03.435]  The club itself consists of large log cabin style homes built into the gorge walls.
[00:42:03.975 --> 00:42:08.199]  There is only one entrance on the north side of the compound which is a paved road
[00:42:09.111 --> 00:42:11.274]  Appropriately named Bohemian Avenue.
[00:42:12.675 --> 00:42:24.809]  A low barbed wire fence surrounds the entire perimeter of the club, but the fence doesn't matter because there is only one place where the hills come together, leaving an opening traversable by foot or car.
[00:42:26.151 --> 00:42:26.431]  Only.
[00:42:27.052 --> 00:42:29.575]  Simply stated, the Bohemian Grove is a walled city.
[00:42:31.079 --> 00:42:37.882]  After being dropped off near the Bohemian Club, we inserted ourselves into the woods about 100 yards from the main entrance.
[00:42:38.503 --> 00:42:42.725]  After going over the barbed wire fence, we found ourselves in what can only be described as a moat.
[00:42:43.645 --> 00:42:48.588]  The entire area along the road at the foot of the cliff wall had been dug out and flooded.
[00:42:49.308 --> 00:42:54.791]  We were able to make our way across the expanse of swamp by jumping from broken tree limbs and other debris.
[00:42:55.678 --> 00:43:05.606]  After climbing up a steep embankment, pulling our way up by gripping on the tree roots, we found ourselves in a large parking lot with hundreds of cars.
[00:43:05.706 --> 00:43:15.013]  We saw several dozen Bohemian Club employees, servants, getting out of the vehicle, which were everything from Mercedes Benz to Ford Tempos.
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:23.425]  At about a hundred yards through the trees, we saw a much larger parking lot filled with more late-model, luxury-style cars.
[00:43:23.765 --> 00:43:28.509]  Obviously, this was the parking area of the actual 2,000 members of the Bohemian Club.
[00:43:29.149 --> 00:43:38.776]  When you come in on the main road, the moat, the swamp, and the embankment are off to the right, or off to the west, just 50 yards of so.
[00:43:40.566 --> 00:43:54.983]  By going across the swamp or moat we made our way past the two checkpoints which consisted of a small guard shack on the left hand side of the road and another 50 yards down the road was another guard shack on the right hand side of the road.
[00:43:55.623 --> 00:44:00.369]  It's a good thing that we decided to sneak around the first two checkpoints by entering through the grove
[00:44:01.411 --> 00:44:06.053]  Employee parking lot, because the real checkpoints lie deeper inside the road.
[00:44:06.153 --> 00:44:18.919]  There was a checkpoint in the middle of the road, a large guard shack with several dozen security people, and then guard shacks on the left and right sides of the roads, which were kind of like the German-style checkpoints you see in old war movies.
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:27.343]  I told Mike I thought it would be a good idea if we tried to get on one of the large trucks that the flat
[00:44:28.081 --> 00:44:37.484]  back open trucks that had been padded seats that were actually picking up members of the Bohemian Club as they were entering whether they were members or employees.
[00:44:37.624 --> 00:44:51.609]  So we went ahead and walked through the woods to the Bohemian Club member parking area and waited for one of the large trucks to pull up at which time myself and Mike climbed into the back of one of the uh... with two older gentlemen.
[00:44:52.249 --> 00:44:55.630]  Mike and myself made small talk conversation as we got into the back of the
[00:44:56.329 --> 00:45:01.854]  Our blacktop rode and drove deeper into the grove, now approaching these larger checkpoints.
[00:45:03.095 --> 00:45:13.524]  In the two or three minutes that we were on board the truck, we caught an interesting conversation on tape, and it's in the video, as two of the members discuss the prices of their ceremonial robes.
[00:45:14.405 --> 00:45:17.127]  Again, all of which is in dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:45:18.152 --> 00:45:21.133]  Our first close call happened as we neared the main checkpoint.
[00:45:21.173 --> 00:45:31.236]  The truck actually stopped, at which time an older gray-haired man made eye contact with the driver of the truck and walked around the back of the truck to stare myself and Mike right in the eye.
[00:45:31.457 --> 00:45:44.921]  Obviously, he was afraid that we might be guests of the two older gentlemen we were riding with in the truck, as Bohemian Club members are allowed to bring guests, so he didn't ask us who we were or what we were doing.
[00:45:45.821 --> 00:45:47.482]  The guards went ahead and waved us
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:50.241]  On with a look of suspicion.
[00:45:50.862 --> 00:45:52.983]  Then we were actually inside of Bohemian Grove.
[00:45:53.323 --> 00:45:57.927]  We heard all the bizarre rumors and we're about to find out what was really going on inside.
[00:45:58.587 --> 00:46:00.769]  The mystery was getting closer to being solved.
[00:46:01.729 --> 00:46:06.453]  The truck drove in for several more minutes and stopped at which time we offloaded.
[00:46:06.473 --> 00:46:09.235]  I told Mike that I wanted to get the cover.
[00:46:09.715 --> 00:46:16.500]  It took us about 45 minutes to an hour to walk all the way through to the bottom of the gorge at which point we
[00:46:17.825 --> 00:46:29.576]  The road abruptly ended and a car could no longer drive on it as we turned into a concrete paved blacktop footpath.
[00:46:30.036 --> 00:46:39.425]  We reached the end of the gorge, which is an observation deck at the top of a 300 foot cliff overlooking the Russian River and the small town of Monterio on the other side.
[00:46:40.154 --> 00:46:54.581]  It was my plan to have the least amount of contact with the Bohemian Club members and staff as I could and wait until night time, nightfall, to attempt to get our hidden cameras and to catch the cremation of care.
[00:46:54.801 --> 00:46:57.382]  To get out our hidden cameras and catch the cremation of care.
[00:47:00.364 --> 00:47:00.864]  On tape.
[00:47:02.685 --> 00:47:14.020]  And it continues, at this point I should digress and go back to say that as we were walking into the grove we actually came within about 10 yards of the 40 foot stone owl that sits to the north side of the small lake.
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:19.467]  We were only about 7 yards away from the black alder that sits at the base of the owl.
[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:23.921]  So already at this point, we had proven that the rumor was true.
[00:47:24.001 --> 00:47:25.801]  Yes, there is a giant stone owl.
[00:47:25.901 --> 00:47:26.822]  Yes, there is an altar.
[00:47:27.382 --> 00:47:34.003]  As we were walking deeper into the grove, past the lake, we saw little metal crosses sticking up from the water's edge.
[00:47:34.023 --> 00:47:35.924]  We'll get to those little metal crosses later.
[00:47:36.844 --> 00:47:40.665]  So now we have been there about an hour at the observation deck.
[00:47:41.105 --> 00:47:42.165]  There was no one around.
[00:47:42.365 --> 00:47:44.346]  All of a sudden, there was an older gentleman, about 16,
[00:47:45.824 --> 00:47:50.487]  7 to 70 years old, wearing a Sonoma County Sheriff's Department uniform, coming up the path.
[00:47:50.567 --> 00:47:52.448]  We didn't even see him coming.
[00:47:52.548 --> 00:47:56.770]  I believe he was the sheriff, and he started speaking to us in some kind of code.
[00:47:57.510 --> 00:48:01.612]  He looked at us directly and said, were you here in 1913?
[00:48:03.573 --> 00:48:05.974]  And, are you one of the old ones?
[00:48:06.435 --> 00:48:08.856]  Now obviously, I was 27 years old at the time.
[00:48:10.703 --> 00:48:12.165]  Now, a few years older, folks.
[00:48:12.365 --> 00:48:13.366]  I'm pretty young, yes.
[00:48:13.866 --> 00:48:20.473]  I was 27 years old at the time, and the man knew I wasn't around in 1913, and that I wasn't one of the old ones.
[00:48:20.594 --> 00:48:25.339]  Knowing that he was testing me, I just calmly said, yeah, I'm with the Hillbillies.
[00:48:25.959 --> 00:48:29.242]  To explain that, there are 95 different clubs within the Bohemian Club.
[00:48:29.722 --> 00:48:36.347]  All the different club houses and log cabin style mansions that are built into the cliffs have different names and different memberships.
[00:48:36.367 --> 00:48:43.512]  The most elite club, according to the press reports, is Mandalay with Henry Kissinger, Paul Volcker, former fellow reserve chairman, and other New World Order bosses.
[00:48:44.153 --> 00:48:51.077]  The hillbilly camp is the camp that the Bushes are members of, the number two camp, along with many other notables in American industry, banking, media, and government.
[00:48:51.577 --> 00:48:54.279]  At that point, he smiled and said, we'll enjoy the day.
[00:48:54.839 --> 00:48:56.440]  He then turned around and walked off.
[00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:02.263]  After he had left, I said to Mike, look, we've got to get to a new position and hide ourselves in the woods.
[00:49:02.603 --> 00:49:04.064]  So we traveled back to the gorge.
[00:49:04.624 --> 00:49:12.048]  Off the cliffside and the observation deck, about halfway into the gorge, we noticed two men in dark suits and sunglasses were following us.
[00:49:12.488 --> 00:49:13.469]  I decided to slow down.
[00:49:14.269 --> 00:49:20.375]  The two men who were obviously private security, secret service or somebody's private bodyguards walked up to us and asked our names.
[00:49:20.976 --> 00:49:26.982]  I gave them my fake name and Mike gave them his fake name and we told them that we were members of the Hillbilly Club.
[00:49:29.733 --> 00:49:35.556]  They said, take it easy, don't stress yourselves out, enjoy yourselves, which was a theme that came up more later.
[00:49:35.576 --> 00:49:39.358]  At this point, we had been confronted twice and we're now being followed.
[00:49:40.138 --> 00:49:46.021]  I told Mike that we had to get into some heavily populated area where a lot of Grove members were congregating.
[00:49:46.121 --> 00:49:49.803]  So we went into several of the clubs, almost had our identities blown.
[00:49:50.737 --> 00:49:57.727]  We went in and had a few drinks because everyone was drinking copiously and they were offering us wine in some of the clubhouses.
[00:49:57.807 --> 00:50:07.841]  We then got back on the road into the large outdoor feasting area where hundreds of tables were being set up for the parties and revelry.
[00:50:09.142 --> 00:50:13.984]  I told Mike we should go up the steep road into the hills where some of the larger structures were located.
[00:50:14.064 --> 00:50:20.706]  It took us about 20 minutes to walk up the road to the only hills that were accessible by foot.
[00:50:21.466 --> 00:50:25.427]  At that point some of the employees began to ask us why we weren't riding a truck up.
[00:50:25.507 --> 00:50:27.168]  We told them that we wanted to exercise.
[00:50:27.208 --> 00:50:29.328]  At that point they started acting pretty suspicious.
[00:50:29.968 --> 00:50:34.790]  We noticed that high up in the hills many of the log cabin structures were deserted with
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:41.884]  Many large decks, so we went into the web camp and just made ourselves comfortable.
[00:50:41.964 --> 00:50:46.027]  The camps have different names like Lost Boys, Doom, Dragon, etc.
[00:50:46.407 --> 00:50:53.552]  We simply sat out the next hour, reloaded our cameras, and got back into place.
[00:50:53.992 --> 00:50:56.214]  I'll cover some of the ritual when we get back.
[00:50:56.234 --> 00:50:56.694]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.282 --> 00:51:01.803]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:01.963 --> 00:51:05.044]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:05.184 --> 00:51:09.105]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:09.145 --> 00:51:13.367]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:13.707 --> 00:51:17.488]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:17.628 --> 00:51:19.429]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:22.286 --> 00:51:27.688]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:27.848 --> 00:51:30.890]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:33.971]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:34.411 --> 00:51:40.534]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:41.074 --> 00:51:44.859]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:52:19.984 --> 00:52:24.325]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:24.465 --> 00:52:24.966]  I don't know.
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:44.103]  Yes, the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[00:53:00.774 --> 00:53:01.114]  I think so.
[00:53:15.982 --> 00:53:16.663]  We're good to go!
[00:53:45.544 --> 00:53:48.626]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:48.786 --> 00:53:54.749]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:02.874 --> 00:54:08.897]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:09.497 --> 00:54:12.459]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:15.601 --> 00:54:22.788]  Alright folks, it is the 15th of July on this Thursday, the 4th anniversary of my infiltration of Bohemian Grove.
[00:54:22.808 --> 00:54:25.170]  I'm going to have Robert Dillon Ross on in the 3rd hour.
[00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:26.091]  You don't want to miss that.
[00:54:27.512 --> 00:54:30.114]  Have him back on and of course get to all the other news.
[00:54:30.555 --> 00:54:31.996]  I've got to hurry through this though.
[00:54:32.696 --> 00:54:34.918]  My little account of Bohemian Grove.
[00:54:34.938 --> 00:54:38.241]  You can read this in the Bohemian Grove section of InfoWars.com.
[00:54:41.136 --> 00:54:46.820]  Continuing, by then the shadows were getting really long and it was just a few minutes until dusk.
[00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:51.883]  We started to hear bizarre chanting and singing coming from down below us in the gorge.
[00:54:51.923 --> 00:54:53.544]  So we traveled back into the gorge.
[00:54:54.124 --> 00:54:59.428]  On our way back down we saw thousands of men chanting and singing drunkenly beneath the giant redwoods.
[00:54:59.848 --> 00:55:01.669]  It was like something out of a fantasy novel.
[00:55:02.049 --> 00:55:03.190]  Hall of the Mountain King.
[00:55:04.025 --> 00:55:06.887]  I expected to see a dragon come humping by any moment.
[00:55:07.327 --> 00:55:19.495]  There were huge skulls hanging down from the floodlights, satanic-style owls with glowing eyes, a lot of trappings of death that we could now see in the twilight illuminated by the large floodlights.
[00:55:20.175 --> 00:55:26.279]  The feasting revelers were beginning to break up and travel down the path towards the lake and the shrine of the owl.
[00:55:27.102 --> 00:55:32.644]  We decided to go ahead and mix it up with them, mix in with them, and go where they were going.
[00:55:33.084 --> 00:55:39.686]  They were going towards the east side of the bank, about 100 yards across from the north tip of the lake, where the idol and the altar stood.
[00:55:40.506 --> 00:55:44.848]  As we were walking around the lake, the only black man we ever saw, a very large black man,
[00:55:46.155 --> 00:55:56.021]  Saw myself and Mike walking very quickly compared to other members in the crowd who wanted to get a good place on the east side of the bank to watch the cremation of Kerr ritual.
[00:55:56.522 --> 00:55:58.783]  All the rumors I had heard were now coming true.
[00:55:58.803 --> 00:56:00.604]  He said, trouble yourselves not.
[00:56:00.624 --> 00:56:01.165]  Take it easy.
[00:56:01.525 --> 00:56:03.206]  The cares of the world are off your shoulders.
[00:56:03.606 --> 00:56:05.087]  You're not supposed to walk that fast.
[00:56:05.107 --> 00:56:07.049]  He then gave us two full-color programs.
[00:56:07.609 --> 00:56:11.832]  On the cover of the program they show Mullet, the big owl with a burning body and flame beneath it.
[00:56:12.732 --> 00:56:13.913]  That's on the website if you want to see it.
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:22.667]  Also, a little demon with the initials PJ was sweeping up someone's ashes on the lower left-hand corner of the program, which is also in the film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:56:24.769 --> 00:56:26.351]  And it continues.
[00:56:26.451 --> 00:56:38.742]  Thousands of men began to gather on the Eastern Bank, private servants, as opposed to the Bohemian Grove employees, who all wear red shirts and who weren't allowed to be present at the ritual, began to put out chairs for their elderly employers.
[00:56:39.511 --> 00:56:45.475]  The sun had now sunken behind a hill, it was completely dark, and you couldn't even see the other side of the water.
[00:56:46.296 --> 00:56:52.781]  There were bats flying around, and a lot of natural fog building on the surface of the water.
[00:56:54.502 --> 00:56:58.205]  Again, there's a lot of natural fog in Northern California, I add.
[00:56:58.605 --> 00:57:07.652]  I'll come back and try to read some segments from the ritual itself, and then we'll get into other news issues in your calls.
[00:57:09.329 --> 00:57:14.590]  But I would encourage all of you to get my video, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:16.390]  It's two hours, five minutes long.
[00:57:17.111 --> 00:57:30.793]  It's the history of the grove, some on skull and bones, the infiltration, the ritual, the aftermath, or I bullhorn the governor's mansion as Bush is announcing his vice presidential candidate back in 2000.
[00:57:31.594 --> 00:57:33.534]  It's a great video and you need to have it.
[00:57:34.214 --> 00:57:38.575]  So go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com and tell them,
[00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:43.451]  If you call the toll-free number that I want dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:57:43.511 --> 00:57:48.473]  So, InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order via the safe, secure shopping cart.
[00:57:49.253 --> 00:57:50.413]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:57:50.433 --> 00:57:51.374]  Again, that's 888-253-3139.
[00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:04.930]  It's $25.95.
[00:58:05.070 --> 00:58:07.531]  Order 3 or more of any of the 10 films I've made.
[00:58:07.591 --> 00:58:09.711]  Any of the titles, they drop down to $20 a piece.
[00:58:10.112 --> 00:58:11.012]  That's a big discount.
[00:58:11.692 --> 00:58:15.653]  You can write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[00:58:15.813 --> 00:58:18.033]  And again, that number, if you missed it, is 1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:18.053 --> 00:58:20.254]  And the video is Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:58:34.494 --> 00:58:36.716]  This is the fourth anniversary of my infiltration.
[00:58:36.736 --> 00:58:38.478]  The first ever, only ever, successful.
[00:58:39.498 --> 00:58:47.385]  And, uh, it is the 132nd year anniversary since they started this Germanic death cult on the West Coast.
[00:58:47.405 --> 00:58:48.026]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:51.596 --> 00:58:52.957]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:59:07.483 --> 00:59:16.705]  Executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:59:16.925 --> 00:59:22.286]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:59:26.726 --> 00:59:27.167]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:59:27.187 --> 00:59:29.027]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:59:37.179 --> 00:59:39.180]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:59:39.761 --> 00:59:42.642]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:44.864 --> 00:59:48.166]  Alright folks, eight minutes into this second hour.
[00:59:48.206 --> 00:59:49.687]  Told a free number to join us.
[00:59:51.568 --> 00:59:54.830]  Concerning, oh, John Kerry and John Edwards.
[00:59:56.011 --> 01:00:03.315]  And the Bilderberg Group and the New York Times going, oh, the Bilderberg Group wanted him to be VP, and they gave a good report to Kerry, so that's why he picked him.
[01:00:03.555 --> 01:00:05.356]  The New York Times actually said that!
[01:00:05.396 --> 01:00:06.097]  What do you think of that?
[01:00:06.792 --> 01:00:08.472]  What do you think of Ridge's new terror alert?
[01:00:08.492 --> 01:00:09.933]  What do you think of all of this?
[01:00:09.973 --> 01:00:12.354]  Let's go to Moe in Austin, Texas.
[01:00:12.694 --> 01:00:14.034]  Moe, welcome again to the Airwaves.
[01:00:14.494 --> 01:00:14.814]  Thank you.
[01:00:14.854 --> 01:00:15.754]  Newsstand Moe.
[01:00:15.775 --> 01:00:23.257]  I want to tell everyone who listens to the show, you probably already know this, but Alex loves humanity.
[01:00:24.577 --> 01:00:29.558]  And he doesn't want to see it go to hell.
[01:00:29.578 --> 01:00:35.380]  The way it's going, there's just going to be a bunch of guys with
[01:00:36.075 --> 01:00:41.917]  Guns and knives standing on a mountain of skulls and there'll be nothing left to even exploit anymore.
[01:00:42.878 --> 01:00:56.203]  Everyone involved in tyranny, if you're a police officer, if you're in the military, defy your masters.
[01:00:56.283 --> 01:00:57.904]  You all can do that.
[01:00:57.924 --> 01:01:00.105]  Just say, hey, we're not going to do that.
[01:01:00.125 --> 01:01:02.286]  You can do it.
[01:01:03.007 --> 01:01:10.689]  Well, yesterday I read this article from the Associated Press where troops just randomly grabbed a young teenager and drowned him for fun.
[01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:16.191]  And they're all being charged with manslaughter now, but our troops, it was very rare in the past.
[01:01:16.231 --> 01:01:17.332]  We didn't behave like that.
[01:01:17.812 --> 01:01:26.194]  Now it's becoming the norm, running over cars because somebody might have stolen some firewood, shooting people, raping women, torturing children.
[01:01:26.214 --> 01:01:28.315]  I mean, what happened to us, Moe?
[01:01:29.535 --> 01:01:31.376]  Well, I want to say something about
[01:01:32.833 --> 01:01:39.258]  The secret societies who are involved in sorcering what they believe is magic, which I reject.
[01:01:40.079 --> 01:01:45.544]  You know, voodoo works on people who believe in it, but it doesn't work on me because I'm just not into that.
[01:01:46.204 --> 01:01:48.006]  The globalists really do believe in the occult.
[01:01:48.186 --> 01:01:48.586]  It is true.
[01:01:49.107 --> 01:01:49.727]  Absolutely.
[01:01:50.768 --> 01:01:55.752]  And I want to say they've been sold a lie that might makes right and the whole sacrifice of care.
[01:01:57.954 --> 01:01:58.995]  They believe that
[01:01:59.997 --> 01:02:04.079]  They are now free from the constraints of karma and can do what they will.
[01:02:05.419 --> 01:02:08.720]  But... They're really shooting themselves in the foot.
[01:02:10.841 --> 01:02:16.283]  And... I just want to comment on something... I have the Conan theme coming on.
[01:02:18.004 --> 01:02:19.324]  To comment on Schwarzenegger.
[01:02:19.844 --> 01:02:23.546]  Listen to the commentary on the new release of Conan the Barbarian.
[01:02:24.166 --> 01:02:26.567]  A lot about him is revealed.
[01:02:27.067 --> 01:02:29.328]  And I'd take bets at work and tell people
[01:02:29.921 --> 01:02:42.768]  I guarantee you, I'll bet you anything, Schwarzenegger will be president of either the, you know, United Biospheres... Well that's a good point.
[01:02:42.828 --> 01:02:46.930]  They've said they're going to build it in Atlanta, the Pan American Union capital.
[01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:48.932]  He could be the president of that.
[01:02:49.052 --> 01:02:51.213]  Clinton, the Secretary General of the U.N.
[01:02:52.012 --> 01:02:57.735]  And they admit, folks, they have seven or six of the G8 lined up for Clinton.
[01:02:58.136 --> 01:03:00.677]  They admit Clinton is probably going to be the next Secretary General.
[01:03:00.717 --> 01:03:02.158]  That's been in major papers.
[01:03:02.878 --> 01:03:03.419]  The U.N.
[01:03:03.479 --> 01:03:06.661]  has said that, and there's a lot of things they could pull.
[01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:14.622]  It's funny and not funny all at the same time because it's a recent recording, he and the director talking.
[01:03:15.143 --> 01:03:23.767]  The director's always trying to steer him over to the real meaning of Conan and says, there were supposed to be three movies and the third one was going to be Conan the Conquered.
[01:03:24.487 --> 01:03:30.590]  When the whole village is being burned, you hear Schwarzenegger said, it is my favorite part, the burning of the village.
[01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:35.452]  But he doesn't say, because it's formative to my character's development and motivations.
[01:03:35.972 --> 01:03:36.953]  He just is thrilled
[01:03:37.762 --> 01:03:38.442]  With the scene.
[01:03:38.782 --> 01:03:44.445]  And then when Falsa Doom rides up, Schwarzenegger says, Look, there's Falsa Doom.
[01:03:44.465 --> 01:03:46.666]  He's hypnotized the woman.
[01:03:47.306 --> 01:03:48.826]  And he's just fascinated.
[01:03:49.067 --> 01:03:51.227]  He's fascinated with the power.
[01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:54.009]  One last point on video games.
[01:03:55.129 --> 01:04:00.351]  Definitely blurring the line between indoctrination and revelation.
[01:04:01.071 --> 01:04:07.314]  There's brilliant minds doing all this stuff, and the video games are designed to
[01:04:10.203 --> 01:04:27.940]  I mean, everything you're saying is true, but more than that, I don't really play a lot of video games, but I do read them and the reviews and look at them and have friends that play them.
[01:04:28.883 --> 01:04:31.764]  Most of the new military games, you're a global assault force.
[01:04:31.784 --> 01:04:33.484]  They have games called New World Order.
[01:04:33.544 --> 01:04:35.325]  You go and kill the evil militia members.
[01:04:35.745 --> 01:04:36.966]  You take over the planet.
[01:04:37.326 --> 01:04:41.267]  Then a bunch of the other games, you kidnap women and rape them to death and get bonus points.
[01:04:41.807 --> 01:04:44.608]  And then our children are playing this, simulating these murders.
[01:04:44.948 --> 01:04:48.009]  And the first video games were developed by the Pentagon in the early 70s.
[01:04:48.789 --> 01:04:51.150]  Because they couldn't get troops to shoot people up close.
[01:04:51.490 --> 01:04:56.092]  It's about pulling the trigger, that mechanism, to disconnect the mind to get them to do it.
[01:04:56.132 --> 01:05:11.537]  So this is all murder simulation, and they admit that with television, children's minds go into a lower-rimmed state of sleep, waking, sleepwalking, and they admit with the video games that it puts you into an even lower level of subconscious control.
[01:05:12.481 --> 01:05:19.544]  And, you know, games like Deus Ex, where the secret government releases biological weapons to create a global crisis, and then have martial law.
[01:05:19.564 --> 01:05:21.825]  I mean, there are hundreds of these games.
[01:05:22.645 --> 01:05:31.288]  Years ago, there was that game Dungeon Keeper, where you kidnap children and torture them as a demon, and you get more power to then come out of your subterranean pit and invade the cities.
[01:05:32.569 --> 01:05:40.252]  And so, yes, they are... The only thing holding back the New World Order is having a mass of evil people that will carry out their aims, and I appreciate the call.
[01:05:41.053 --> 01:05:50.820]  And Arnold Schwarzenegger, the reason I know they've got big plans for him, nobody else can run to a bodybuilding contest and scream, n-word, n-word, I hate black people and get away with it.
[01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:56.765]  No one else can say, I always dreamed of being a powerful dictator like Hitler or Jesus.
[01:05:57.385 --> 01:05:58.046]  And that's a quote.
[01:05:58.918 --> 01:06:05.720]  No one else can say, I don't care if Kurt Voltheim is a Nazi, I love him and support him!
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:10.942]  When it was top news in 1986 and then he went to Austria to campaign for him to be president.
[01:06:12.082 --> 01:06:13.982]  I mean, no one else is allowed to do that.
[01:06:14.022 --> 01:06:18.664]  He goes to the Rothschild Castle, we have the Scotsman in the photos of that, the news articles.
[01:06:19.444 --> 01:06:22.485]  He's hooked in with Warren Buffett, the globalist super gopher.
[01:06:23.991 --> 01:06:28.674]  He just has a blank check and Senator Orrin Hatch wants to repeal the 22nd Amendment for Arnold.
[01:06:30.174 --> 01:06:31.955]  Yeah, they got big plans for Arnold.
[01:06:32.995 --> 01:06:33.716]  And that's true.
[01:06:33.776 --> 01:06:49.563]  And by the way, he's out wanting this DNA testing in California and all this other stuff and more gun control and more open borders and driver's licenses to the illegals and oh, he's so conservative and I heard Limbaugh, I heard Hannity worship him and say they supported him in Bush.
[01:06:50.063 --> 01:06:51.444]  I mean, that's your conservatism?
[01:06:53.228 --> 01:07:01.172]  Because Arnold is this archetype, this war king, and they want to come out with this new movie, you know, King Conan, where he's the king of the earth.
[01:07:01.872 --> 01:07:03.173]  It's mind control, people.
[01:07:03.193 --> 01:07:13.338]  You know, they're going to give us our chief, our Nazi chief, and we're going to love him, and the ADL's going to hail him, and if you fight the Nazis, they're going to call you a Nazi.
[01:07:13.358 --> 01:07:16.159]  All right, I know we've got more calls.
[01:07:16.179 --> 01:07:17.760]  We'll get to you coming up here in a few minutes.
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:21.641]  I've got to cover this... I don't know.
[01:07:21.842 --> 01:07:22.682]  Who's up next, Stephanie?
[01:07:26.115 --> 01:07:27.336]  Who should I go to next, Stephanie?
[01:07:29.257 --> 01:07:34.441]  Okay, we'll go to Ron in New York in just a second, but I've got to hit this first.
[01:07:35.161 --> 01:07:36.862]  Out of all these articles, listen to this.
[01:07:37.823 --> 01:07:42.106]  Swedish pastors sentenced to months in jail for offending homosexuals.
[01:07:43.155 --> 01:07:50.959]  And it's a big evangelical official news site and they have a link to the Swedish official government website.
[01:07:51.579 --> 01:07:55.061]  Swedish pastor sentenced to one month jail for offending homosexuals.
[01:07:55.581 --> 01:08:11.288]  A Swedish court, this is on PrisonPlanet.tv, a Swedish court has sentenced a pastor belonging to the Pentecostal movement in Sweden, Ake Green, to a month in prison under a law against incitement after he was found guilty of having offended homosexuals in a sermon.
[01:08:12.239 --> 01:08:14.121]  Folks, they passed a law last year.
[01:08:14.861 --> 01:08:17.924]  The Republican governor of Pennsylvania, Mark Schweiker, did say the same thing.
[01:08:18.264 --> 01:08:24.169]  And whether you love homosexuality or hate it, you have a First Amendment right to criticize it.
[01:08:24.489 --> 01:08:25.430]  A free speech right.
[01:08:26.371 --> 01:08:30.234]  And so they're going to have their First Amendment to promote their agenda, but we're not going to have our First Amendment.
[01:08:30.855 --> 01:08:36.660]  Soren Andersen, the president of the Swedish Federation of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights,
[01:08:38.124 --> 01:08:43.206]  said of the hearing the sentence that religious freedom could never be used as a reason to offend people.
[01:08:43.226 --> 01:08:44.387]  So now offending people.
[01:08:44.687 --> 01:08:51.569]  Therefore, he told journalists, I cannot regard the sentence as an act of interference with freedom of religion.
[01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:58.612]  During the sermon in 2003, Green described homosexuality as abominable, a horrible cancerous tumor in the body of society.
[01:09:00.373 --> 01:09:02.834]  And now it'll be some other free speech.
[01:09:02.874 --> 01:09:03.974]  It'll be your free speech.
[01:09:04.635 --> 01:09:06.235]  You try to go out and protest Bush?
[01:09:06.536 --> 01:09:07.496]  You're not allowed to!
[01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:13.361]  You know, you have a free speech zone a mile away and you get arrested and you spend a year in prison.
[01:09:13.401 --> 01:09:15.182]  I mean, that actually has happened.
[01:09:15.842 --> 01:09:18.323]  As you peacefully stood there with a sign saying, no blood for oil.
[01:09:18.484 --> 01:09:20.705]  But you're all for arresting the Christian preachers!
[01:09:21.645 --> 01:09:22.525]  Ron in New York.
[01:09:22.625 --> 01:09:23.506]  Ron, you're on the air.
[01:09:23.566 --> 01:09:24.026]  Go ahead.
[01:09:24.046 --> 01:09:25.047]  Hi, Alex.
[01:09:25.327 --> 01:09:28.008]  You know, it's funny you mention that about protests.
[01:09:28.068 --> 01:09:36.972]  What I'm calling you about is just yesterday it was reported on the news, on ABC Radio News, when the Republican National Convention comes to town in August,
[01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:39.641]  Many groups intend to protest there.
[01:09:39.701 --> 01:09:45.345]  Now, two of the groups that intend to protest are the police union in New York City and the fire union.
[01:09:45.845 --> 01:09:49.928]  The police commissioner of New York, which is our chief of police in New York,
[01:09:50.601 --> 01:09:53.242]  actually threatened his own rank-and-file.
[01:09:53.302 --> 01:09:54.742]  It's a point-blank statement he made.
[01:09:55.142 --> 01:10:01.204]  If they think they're going to protest at the Republican Convention in August, they had better be careful and think again.
[01:10:01.344 --> 01:10:02.244]  That's what it's coming to.
[01:10:02.625 --> 01:10:04.945]  I saw that in the New York Post two days ago.
[01:10:05.805 --> 01:10:08.906]  Also, I should have posted that.
[01:10:08.926 --> 01:10:09.487]  I think we did.
[01:10:10.047 --> 01:10:17.809]  Also, coast-to-coast at universities, deans stand up and say, if one person speaks out or protests,
[01:10:18.329 --> 01:10:23.532]  At this graduation ceremony, you will all have your diplomas taken away from you.
[01:10:24.192 --> 01:10:30.855]  Oh, by the way, a case like that happened here in Brooklyn, New York, where a young lady graduating high school, she was class valedictorian,
[01:10:31.678 --> 01:10:32.579]  This is fascism.
[01:10:32.659 --> 01:10:36.641]  When you have a police chief actually going so far as to threaten people, even his own low echelon rank and file,
[01:10:52.069 --> 01:10:59.236]  Because they exercise the most basic constitutional, the most basic human right to protest peacefully and threaten these people.
[01:10:59.576 --> 01:11:00.738]  You invented a new stage.
[01:11:00.758 --> 01:11:02.920]  You're not just trying to deprive you of free speech.
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:04.782]  They're trying to impose fascism.
[01:11:05.142 --> 01:11:15.892]  Well, I think the police should protest because they've had, what was it, the two billion dollars for the asbestos they breathed in, held back even from the police and firemen, and then now they admit the
[01:11:16.613 --> 01:11:22.435]  The EPA was told to cover that up and it's admitted that building was full of asbestos and those people breathed it, Ron!
[01:11:22.695 --> 01:11:29.697]  And they have the basic right to engage in peaceful protest and should not be threatened by the chief law enforcement agent in this city for doing that.
[01:11:29.717 --> 01:11:30.358]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:11:30.378 --> 01:11:31.438]  We'll talk more about it when we get back.
[01:11:32.205 --> 01:11:33.306]  Well again, it's the new freedom.
[01:11:33.526 --> 01:11:36.307]  Get arrested for criticizing anybody the government doesn't want you to criticize.
[01:11:36.867 --> 01:11:37.868]  It's finally here.
[01:11:38.008 --> 01:11:38.988]  Spring has arrived.
[01:11:39.168 --> 01:11:42.130]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:11:42.370 --> 01:11:45.811]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:11:46.031 --> 01:11:54.135]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[01:11:54.435 --> 01:11:58.178]  With ARC's Heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[01:11:58.378 --> 01:12:03.421]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.

[01:13:42.597 --> 01:13:45.658]  What kinds of investments will be able to withstand an economic meltdown?
[01:13:45.798 --> 01:13:48.339]  The problem is, it's not always easy to find great solutions.

[01:14:31.586 --> 01:14:32.146]  Do it today.

[01:14:36.363 --> 01:14:38.644]  My family's breathing easier and now you can too!
[01:14:38.824 --> 01:14:42.185]  Hey folks, Michael Truebell here to tell you about the Biozone Air Purifier.
[01:14:42.285 --> 01:14:44.486]  The Biozone Air Purifier is not a filter system.
[01:14:44.666 --> 01:14:50.629]  It works at the molecular level, binding the small bits of dust, allergens, and other particles in your air into clumps that are too heavy to float.
[01:14:50.849 --> 01:14:53.410]  They fall harmlessly to the floor to be literally swept away.
[01:14:53.670 --> 01:14:54.350]  Nothing escapes!
[01:14:54.450 --> 01:14:58.672]  The Biozone Air Purifier also kills virus and bacteria germs and totally removes odors.
[01:14:58.852 --> 01:15:02.473]  Out on the farm we have several cats and two big dogs, so pet odors can be a concern.
[01:15:02.593 --> 01:15:04.814]  But like the odors from anything else, simply gone!
[01:15:05.074 --> 01:15:05.394]  Smoke?
[01:15:05.634 --> 01:15:07.495]  My wife and I don't, but several of our friends do.
[01:15:07.655 --> 01:15:10.735]  Our Biozone Air Purifier clears out that smoke literally within minutes.
[01:15:10.935 --> 01:15:15.056]  I use it myself, and I'm telling you, your Biozone Air Purifier will improve the air in your home.
[01:15:15.216 --> 01:15:17.877]  It even comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee and free shipping.

[01:15:31.679 --> 01:15:34.640]  Get your Biozone Air Purifier today, and you'll be breathing easier, too.
[01:15:36.272 --> 01:16:01.865]  You know, I don't want to say it's funny, but New York police and others will go out and tell a group of protesters that are in their designated area that they have to disperse or they'll attack innocent crowds and spray pepper spray on women with babies in their arms and then
[01:16:03.485 --> 01:16:07.047]  Oh, by the way, you may lose your job if you protest and you're off-duty.
[01:16:08.367 --> 01:16:13.630]  And the thing is, they do this out in the open now, and then they tell people, you're going to lose your diploma if you criticize this.
[01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:17.812]  They say, oh, you can only be in a free speech zone, away from the media.
[01:16:18.772 --> 01:16:26.137]  And they're giving people prison sentences for this, and the government hires provocateurs, but, uh, Ron, is this making the police happy in New York?
[01:16:26.157 --> 01:16:28.659]  Do they like this dose of fascism?
[01:16:29.359 --> 01:16:45.530]  No, they don't at all, and, uh, you know, speaking to what you said, and I've spoken to you in the past about this, I've always said that lower-level minions should be careful about how faithfully they serve their higher-level masters, because eventually they will turn on you.
[01:16:46.150 --> 01:16:51.376]  Because once you outlive your usefulness to them, you will go on to the train.
[01:16:51.416 --> 01:16:54.839]  You will be placed into the train cars like everyone else.
[01:16:54.859 --> 01:17:02.107]  Well also, we had Hillary Clinton got booed during 9-11 events she was trying to get into.
[01:17:02.627 --> 01:17:06.992]  But they also booed a few weeks ago, last week, Dick Cheney at Yankee Stadium.
[01:17:07.612 --> 01:17:09.674]  So this shows they don't like any of them.
[01:17:09.954 --> 01:17:11.155]  They know it's a fraud.
[01:17:11.175 --> 01:17:12.996]  They know what happened.
[01:17:13.416 --> 01:17:18.960]  Do New Yorkers still talk about how they weren't given any medical treatment for the asbestos?
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:21.722]  And all these people are sick and Bush had it covered up?
[01:17:21.762 --> 01:17:23.143]  Or do they just forget about that too?
[01:17:23.183 --> 01:17:25.404]  No, that controversy still goes on.
[01:17:25.604 --> 01:17:29.507]  That controversy still goes on and it's still discussed and it's still fairly prominent.
[01:17:29.547 --> 01:17:32.029]  You will see it periodically pop up in our newspapers.
[01:17:32.629 --> 01:17:33.570]  That's still discussed.
[01:17:34.011 --> 01:17:40.797]  But the greatest outrage here to me is the fact that a man who was sworn to uphold the Constitution could actually make a statement like that.
[01:17:40.857 --> 01:17:54.990]  Now, I admit, you see, and I'm kind of, in a perverse way, I'm sort of a little glad it happened, because now they will understand when they're given orders to go and clear out other protesters, whatever their political beliefs or whatever,
[01:17:55.490 --> 01:18:06.028]  Now they understand the chickens come home to roost and that this alligarh, this high-level alligarh has no more use for its foot soldiers than it does for the people.
[01:18:06.730 --> 01:18:08.872]  That it orders its foot soldiers to move again.
[01:18:08.912 --> 01:18:10.493]  Well, it's, you know, more than that.
[01:18:10.614 --> 01:18:21.123]  I mean, they can't have tens of thousands of police out there protesting on the news cameras because, you know, Fox News and others tell us that everyone loves Bush and, you know, it's milk and honey.
[01:18:21.784 --> 01:18:24.306]  And that, you know, it's just evil hippies that don't like him.
[01:18:24.706 --> 01:18:25.807]  Yeah, well, this is true, too.
[01:18:25.867 --> 01:18:27.769]  It creates that kind of conundrum for them.
[01:18:27.869 --> 01:18:29.911]  And in addition, Alex, another thing that they've done
[01:18:30.723 --> 01:18:34.466]  And I love the way that these people are like elites from another era.
[01:18:34.506 --> 01:18:37.968]  They're like the old elites probably we had in King George's time.
[01:18:37.988 --> 01:18:39.089]  You know, let them eat cake.
[01:18:39.530 --> 01:18:42.652]  They're actually related to those very people.
[01:18:42.712 --> 01:18:45.274]  And they still think like them, too, here in the 21st century.
[01:18:45.634 --> 01:18:47.436]  You have many businesses in that area.
[01:18:47.476 --> 01:18:53.420]  Now, I don't know if you or your listeners are very familiar with that part of New York, but there are many businesses.
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:54.561]  Many, okay?
[01:18:55.041 --> 01:19:07.872]  Businesses immediately surrounding, well I shouldn't say immediately surrounding, within several blocks of Madison Square Garden, are going to suffer because those streets are going to be closed down, even so much as to pedestrian foot traffic.
[01:19:08.332 --> 01:19:11.354]  They don't care about the fact that they're going to harm some small businessmen.
[01:19:11.414 --> 01:19:17.219]  Well, sir, sir, sir, in Georgia, for the G8 Summit, they openly declared martial law.
[01:19:17.299 --> 01:19:17.980]  Thanks for the call.
[01:19:19.341 --> 01:19:20.181]  Uh, who's up next?
[01:19:20.242 --> 01:19:21.182]  Is it Xavier?
[01:19:22.403 --> 01:19:24.385]  Xavier in Texas, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:19:25.481 --> 01:19:26.301]  Right.
[01:19:26.801 --> 01:19:27.322]  Good morning.
[01:19:27.422 --> 01:19:30.442]  I just want to say you're a breath of fresh air on the airwave.
[01:19:32.163 --> 01:19:39.705]  And I've been already making an effort to tell other people about you and to get some shortwave radios to listen to your program.
[01:19:39.725 --> 01:19:40.525]  Well good!
[01:19:40.825 --> 01:19:49.328]  Because I've been delighted and you have taken a lot of frustration off of me as I look at the way the nation has been going.
[01:19:49.938 --> 01:19:55.459]  And hardly too many voices speaking up about the evils that are really cramming us in.
[01:19:56.259 --> 01:20:02.781]  What I call to mention to you today is simply something that has been annoying me for a very long time.
[01:20:02.801 --> 01:20:04.701]  Sir, are you on a speakerphone?
[01:20:05.361 --> 01:20:06.021]  Yes, I am.
[01:20:06.361 --> 01:20:07.082]  Yeah, it's horrible.
[01:20:07.122 --> 01:20:08.482]  You never do that on talk radio.
[01:20:08.742 --> 01:20:10.842]  Okay, well... You're almost unintelligible.
[01:20:10.862 --> 01:20:16.123]  Okay, I will switch my... I'm on the other line now with you.
[01:20:16.283 --> 01:20:19.064]  Yeah, that... Now hang up the speakerphone.
[01:20:19.557 --> 01:20:22.398]  Yeah, it is closed off.
[01:20:22.778 --> 01:20:23.359]  Okay.
[01:20:23.399 --> 01:20:35.484]  What I want to say to you very quickly, I'm an ex-serviceman, and in addition to that, I'm also a theologian, although I don't practice as a pastor of churches.
[01:20:36.224 --> 01:20:43.407]  And there is something that bugs me very much that I want to share on the airwaves for a lot of families and men who might be listening.
[01:20:44.088 --> 01:20:46.689]  I do pray for the soldiers who are in harm's way.
[01:20:47.503 --> 01:20:54.125]  But I have something about killing human beings, especially innocent children.
[01:20:54.905 --> 01:21:16.850]  And although I know some of these things cannot be said in the military by chaplains to encourage people, I want to say personally from my theological background and from my ex-experience as a military person, that the God of the Bible that I know, a soldier wherever he is, be it in prison or on the battlefield, he can pray to God personally,
[01:21:17.694 --> 01:21:22.240]  And complain to God about his condition and say what he wants to say.
[01:21:22.841 --> 01:21:26.406]  And the God of the Bible that I'm talking about is powerful enough.
[01:21:26.666 --> 01:21:27.587]  We're on the march.
[01:21:28.068 --> 01:21:29.710]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:30.611 --> 01:21:33.295]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:36.937 --> 01:21:38.278]  Is your daily commute a grind?
[01:21:38.458 --> 01:21:42.200]  If it wears on your patience, you'll be amazed at how it grinds on your car or truck, too.
[01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:46.082]  Your engine and transmission wear away mile after mile and day after day.
[01:21:46.402 --> 01:21:50.024]  Hundreds of NT Oil Additive customers have reported increased fuel mileage.
[01:21:50.264 --> 01:21:54.686]  Fleets that conduct used oil analysis report up to 30% reduction in wear metals.
[01:21:55.006 --> 01:21:58.808]  NT Oil Additive is a 100% synthetic product made to perform.
[01:21:59.048 --> 01:21:59.769]  It really works!
[01:22:00.009 --> 01:22:06.132]  NT Oil Additive has been proven in many thousands of engines, manual and automatic transmissions, and other driveline components.
[01:22:06.412 --> 01:22:07.533]  Even in two-cycle engines.
[01:22:07.813 --> 01:22:10.334]  NT Oil Additive was developed for industrial uses.
[01:22:10.494 --> 01:22:13.755]  It works in heat exchangers, air compressors, vacuum pumps and air tools.
[01:22:13.955 --> 01:22:19.017]  Gearboxes and hydraulic systems can operate up to 18 degrees cooler with NT Oil Additive.
[01:22:19.197 --> 01:22:20.638]  Diesel engines thrive on it too.
[01:22:20.838 --> 01:22:24.920]  To place your order, call King Oil Company at 800-647-4079.

[01:22:36.815 --> 01:22:38.415]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:22:38.555 --> 01:22:42.697]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:22:42.797 --> 01:22:45.677]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:22:45.757 --> 01:22:52.479]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:22:52.659 --> 01:22:55.660]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:58.261]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:22:58.381 --> 01:23:03.102]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[01:23:03.302 --> 01:23:17.867]  Try Halo Methanes and volatile organic elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are extracted.
[01:23:18.027 --> 01:23:24.449]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-8888.

[01:23:47.515 --> 01:23:55.537]  It doesn't take much space, just a small area of countertop, windowsill, or porch, and you can have fresh, juicable wheatgrass in only ten days.
[01:23:55.993 --> 01:23:59.434]  Growing your own wheatgrass is not only healthy, but it's a fun hobby too!

[01:24:37.438 --> 01:24:40.179]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:44.042]  It's Alex Jones only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:47.512 --> 01:24:59.798]  Alright, we're letting Xavier finish up his comment about Christian people not supposed to be involved in activities like killing innocent children.
[01:25:00.979 --> 01:25:03.560]  I don't think... Is that a stretch?
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:05.281]  Is it radical for me to say that?
[01:25:05.301 --> 01:25:10.044]  That drowning people and killing them and torturing them and raping women is wrong?
[01:25:11.736 --> 01:25:12.476]  I don't know.
[01:25:12.496 --> 01:25:14.217]  Maybe that's how Al Qaeda talks.
[01:25:14.497 --> 01:25:19.718]  A good American is for torture and death and evil and government looting and everything else.
[01:25:19.818 --> 01:25:26.719]  But a lot of these Christian churches say George Bush is anointed of God and he's the devil's against him.
[01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:32.681]  I always thought Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove were pretty satanic, but according to these groups, they're not.
[01:25:34.521 --> 01:25:38.262]  Massive denial going on, but going back to Xavier, finish up what you were saying.
[01:25:38.979 --> 01:25:39.839]  Yes, thank you.
[01:25:40.079 --> 01:25:52.563]  And all that I just want to say is I feel for the families of soldiers, especially those who die on the battlefield and receive the draping of the United States flag, which I have nothing against.
[01:25:53.383 --> 01:26:05.807]  But people need to know, and soldiers themselves need to know, because of their predicament, the God of the Bible that I learn about is one who is powerful enough that can break any yoke of any precedent
[01:26:06.272 --> 01:26:08.933]  Or any nation according to biblical history.
[01:26:09.493 --> 01:26:21.498]  And I want to offer this as a way out for the soldiers on the battlefield because I've spoken to many of their men who counsel them in the chaplaincy and had strong discussions with them.
[01:26:22.245 --> 01:26:30.931]  And many of these things are held back from the soldiers because, according to law, it's not permissible for these things to be revealed.
[01:26:31.271 --> 01:26:33.872]  The final thing that I close with is simply this.
[01:26:34.453 --> 01:26:40.837]  America needs to watch every leader of the evangelical movement of this nation.
[01:26:41.528 --> 01:26:47.611]  I am not saying that they're all evil, but I'm saying to America, listen with a very sharp ear.
[01:26:48.131 --> 01:26:49.152]  And thank you very much.
[01:26:49.652 --> 01:26:50.912]  All right, I appreciate the call.
[01:26:50.932 --> 01:26:52.873]  Well, I'll tell you, a bunch of them are wicked devils.
[01:26:53.614 --> 01:26:59.456]  I mean, they're up there as Judas goats, and it's really that simple.
[01:27:00.757 --> 01:27:05.399]  If they don't play ball, their big television companies get broken up and lose their 501c3.
[01:27:06.139 --> 01:27:09.681]  And so the Patriot Act is good and loving, and you're a devil worshiper if you're against it?
[01:27:10.362 --> 01:27:12.322]  Bush just has fun at Skull and Bones.
[01:27:12.362 --> 01:27:13.383]  It's no big deal.
[01:27:13.423 --> 01:27:14.783]  Bohemian Grub doesn't exist.
[01:27:14.803 --> 01:27:16.403]  You're evil if you talk about it.
[01:27:18.024 --> 01:27:19.484]  Bush is this great conservative.
[01:27:19.584 --> 01:27:21.464]  I mean, on and on and on and on.
[01:27:21.484 --> 01:27:23.165]  That's why so many people are neutralized.
[01:27:24.785 --> 01:27:33.867]  I mean, look, you have the former head of the Christian Coalition, Reid, at the Bilderberg Group meeting with, you know, Kerry's running mate.
[01:27:33.887 --> 01:27:35.187]  That's in the New York Times.
[01:27:37.288 --> 01:27:38.108]  Just amazing.
[01:27:39.006 --> 01:27:45.468]  We're about to go to Debbie Morrow just for a few minutes and then we'll get to John and Ken and everybody else that's patiently holding.
[01:27:45.808 --> 01:27:49.049]  The total free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231 800-259-9231 but on PrisonPlanet.com in the 9-11 section
[01:28:02.949 --> 01:28:16.643]  We just have a ton of information about Sybil Edmonds and how she was this FBI translator ordered to falsify transcripts to cover up total prior knowledge before September 11th.
[01:28:16.683 --> 01:28:18.045]  And she's been threatened and the rest of it.
[01:28:18.465 --> 01:28:21.268]  Now they've thrown her suit out declaring national security.
[01:28:21.308 --> 01:28:23.330]  See, everything's national security.
[01:28:23.370 --> 01:28:24.652]  So I want to get into that later.
[01:28:25.786 --> 01:28:33.133]  Also on PrisonPlanet.com we have in the Brave New World section a subsection called Vaccines, Killer Vaccines.
[01:28:34.254 --> 01:28:43.424]  And there's articles about not just the polio shots but other vaccines that have cancer virus in them, mercury, weird hormones that sterilize women, you name it.
[01:28:44.815 --> 01:28:48.338]  Well, this is an article out of PrisonPlanet.com today.
[01:28:48.358 --> 01:28:49.759]  It needs to be added to that archive.
[01:28:50.239 --> 01:28:54.863]  Millions more may have been given cancer-contaminated polio vaccines.
[01:28:54.883 --> 01:28:58.005]  This is out of the New Scientist, July 8, 2004.
[01:29:00.607 --> 01:29:02.048]  Highly respected journal.
[01:29:02.329 --> 01:29:12.917]  Now, remember, remember that late last year, I went in for a check-up to my doctor, something I hadn't done in many, many years.
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:23.428]  And my doctor told me, you know, Alex, I heard you talking about cancer viruses, and I know about SV40, the polio vaccine, but by law, you're not supposed to give that in the U.S.
[01:29:24.008 --> 01:29:25.950]  They can still give it to people in the third world.
[01:29:25.970 --> 01:29:26.571]  Isn't that interesting?
[01:29:26.591 --> 01:29:31.396]  Just openly, they can give you a cancer virus-filled vaccine, which is a medley, gives you deadly, accelerated cancers.
[01:29:32.802 --> 01:29:41.669]  Well, he said, as a doctor, we're required every year to do so much community service at clinics and to go and do retraining and things.
[01:29:42.170 --> 01:29:49.396]  And he said, I went and was volunteering for a week at one of these big regional clinics and they were giving to the welfare children.
[01:29:50.888 --> 01:29:53.069]  The Ortal Polio Vaccine.
[01:29:53.109 --> 01:29:54.110]  He said, I couldn't believe it.
[01:29:54.130 --> 01:29:55.131]  I said, well, which clinic?
[01:29:55.171 --> 01:29:56.212]  No, I can't talk about it.
[01:29:56.552 --> 01:29:57.112]  No, I can't.
[01:29:57.132 --> 01:29:58.674]  I said, you can't save people's lives.
[01:29:58.694 --> 01:30:02.036]  He goes, well, you know, I'm getting in a lot of trouble and I'm just not going to get into it.
[01:30:02.076 --> 01:30:02.917]  I told you about it.
[01:30:05.439 --> 01:30:07.460]  So, I came and warned you of this.
[01:30:07.581 --> 01:30:08.241]  Well, here it is.
[01:30:08.261 --> 01:30:08.902]  A new scientist.
[01:30:09.262 --> 01:30:15.507]  Many millions more people than previously thought might have been given polio vaccine contaminated with a monkey virus linked to cancer.
[01:30:15.867 --> 01:30:16.988]  Inclusively proven.
[01:30:17.728 --> 01:30:31.660]  It has been known since 1960 that early doses of the polio vaccine were widely contaminated, they still are, with Simian virus 40, or SV40, which infects monkeys.
[01:30:33.181 --> 01:30:35.263]  Tens of millions of people in the U.S.
[01:30:35.684 --> 01:30:41.689]  and an unknown number in other countries, including the U.K., Australia, and the former Soviet Union, may have been exposed
[01:30:42.819 --> 01:30:50.621]  And it goes on, the contamination occurred because the kidney cells that the vaccine virus was grown in came from monkeys infected with SV40.
[01:30:50.641 --> 01:30:53.442]  Health officials say the problem was eliminated.
[01:30:54.782 --> 01:31:09.405]  Now, Michael Carbone of Loyola University Medical Center, who was in the Chicago Tribune two years ago, folks, in Chicago has announced results that suggested that the Soviet polio vaccine was contaminated after 1963, possibly until the 1980s.
[01:31:12.936 --> 01:31:15.500]  It is, is there infectious virus?
[01:31:16.141 --> 01:31:20.828]  The short answer is yes, Cabrone told the Vaccine Cells
[01:31:21.926 --> 01:31:26.268]  substrate conference of 2004 in Rockville, Maryland last year.
[01:31:26.308 --> 01:31:29.070]  The vaccine was almost certainly used throughout the Soviet bloc.
[01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:32.031]  Folks, my doctor told me they're still giving it here in Austin.
[01:31:32.571 --> 01:31:38.614]  The vaccine was almost certainly used throughout the Soviet bloc and probably exported to China, Japan, several countries in Asia.
[01:31:39.395 --> 01:31:42.796]  That means hundreds of millions could have been exposed to SV40 and SV63.
[01:31:42.816 --> 01:31:47.519]  Then it gets into the massive increase in these formerly rare cancers.
[01:31:47.859 --> 01:31:49.460]  They go into the tissues and find SV40.
[01:31:51.011 --> 01:31:55.535]  The consensus of exposure to the virus are unclear.
[01:31:55.695 --> 01:32:12.107]  There is evidence that in some of the people given contaminated vaccines were infected by SV40 and that such infections might lead to the development of certain types of cancer many years down the line, but the link with cancer has neither been proven nor shown to be false.
[01:32:12.794 --> 01:32:13.435]  I love that.
[01:32:13.455 --> 01:32:18.319]  I mean, I've probably read 20 medical journals, top scientists, have them on.
[01:32:18.839 --> 01:32:21.602]  It is totally conclusive, but it's inconclusive, they say.
[01:32:22.042 --> 01:32:27.907]  There are two scenarios, says Philip Minor of the National Institute of Biological Standards and Control in the UK.
[01:32:28.548 --> 01:32:30.730]  One is that it doesn't matter, the other is that it does.
[01:32:31.593 --> 01:32:41.435]  Minor found three samples of the Soviet oral polio vaccine from the late 1960s in the NIBSC's freezers, the only samples known to survive from the time.
[01:32:41.956 --> 01:32:47.157]  In 1999, he found they were tested positive for SV40, whereas British samples from the period did not.
[01:32:47.537 --> 01:32:49.837]  But we did not draw any broad conclusions.
[01:32:49.957 --> 01:32:50.578]  On and on and on.
[01:32:51.938 --> 01:32:59.720]  So, again, folks, just a few months ago, they found sterilization hormones in the new vaccines being given in the third world by the UN.
[01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:00.540]  I mean, it's conclusive.
[01:33:01.232 --> 01:33:18.516]  The point is that they admit that the vaccines, the experimental anthrax shot, which they made the troops take, was filled with mercury, live viruses, bacteria, all this stuff, and was killing people.
[01:33:19.356 --> 01:33:22.456]  Causing bizarre, accelerated autoimmune diseases.
[01:33:22.556 --> 01:33:23.156]  That's admitted.
[01:33:24.557 --> 01:33:30.378]  They admit that the new smallpox vaccine, made out of the old, is dangerous.
[01:33:31.149 --> 01:33:37.652]  They admit that cancer in this country is up over 500% from the 1920s.
[01:33:40.013 --> 01:33:44.074]  And... Heaven help us, folks.
[01:33:44.094 --> 01:33:48.476]  You know, there's other environmental reasons for this, but a lot of it's the vaccines.
[01:33:49.316 --> 01:33:53.318]  Let's go ahead and go to Debbie Morrow, then we'll go to John and Ken and many others.
[01:33:53.938 --> 01:33:58.400]  Debbie, all the more reason to filter your water, because the sewage
[01:33:59.236 --> 01:34:00.917]  Is filled with amoebas.
[01:34:01.438 --> 01:34:03.299]  It's filled with cancer viruses.
[01:34:03.799 --> 01:34:04.640]  This has been proven.
[01:34:05.781 --> 01:34:12.286]  In fact, SV40, by the way, you can type this in, SV40 spreads through contaminated water supplies.
[01:34:12.666 --> 01:34:14.167]  Big time in India and Mexico.
[01:34:14.247 --> 01:34:15.168]  And we know what happens here.
[01:34:15.188 --> 01:34:15.688]  Some do.
[01:34:17.009 --> 01:34:18.550]  The chlorine and stuff doesn't kill this.
[01:34:18.910 --> 01:34:20.311]  The fluoride that's in the water.
[01:34:21.152 --> 01:34:22.773]  Not to mention the MBTE.
[01:34:23.053 --> 01:34:23.834]  All the trash.
[01:34:24.254 --> 01:34:26.356]  Why would we not filter our water, Debbie?
[01:34:27.156 --> 01:34:27.717]  I have no idea.
[01:34:28.502 --> 01:34:35.347]  Because filtering your water is one of the simplest ways to protect your family.
[01:34:35.547 --> 01:34:39.689]  Why give your kids, your loved ones, your animals poison?
[01:34:40.730 --> 01:34:54.199]  I was reading a really good journal the other day about diet and you know different things about here in America today the industry
[01:34:57.805 --> 01:35:08.333]  Water, food, all of them have gotten to be so bad of what we're putting in our bodies that it's just like we're just handing our kids a cup of poison and saying, here, honey, I love you.
[01:35:08.613 --> 01:35:11.735]  You know, it's time for us to take control of our lives.
[01:35:12.196 --> 01:35:17.340]  And one of the easiest ways to take control is by drinking at least good water.
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:20.082]  And that's what's so great about the Berkey.
[01:35:20.282 --> 01:35:22.984]  It really does make a difference in your life.
[01:35:23.064 --> 01:35:24.385]  It will make you feel better.
[01:35:24.958 --> 01:35:31.859]  Now, as well as have it, God forbid, something happens further down the road and you need to drink pond or lake water.
[01:35:32.159 --> 01:35:33.920]  Well, I'll tell you, it's not placebo.
[01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:39.241]  I'll be out of town, drink a glass of tap water every once in a while, and I feel bad after I drink it.
[01:35:39.261 --> 01:35:41.781]  I didn't even pay attention, and then suddenly I kind of have like a headache.
[01:35:41.801 --> 01:35:42.502]  I don't feel well.
[01:35:43.322 --> 01:35:45.122]  But, you know, it's not just my feeling.
[01:35:45.682 --> 01:35:49.723]  After you drink murky, filtered water for a month, try to drink your tap water, folks.
[01:35:50.410 --> 01:35:51.091]  Oh, I know.
[01:35:51.252 --> 01:35:53.135]  You can even take your Berkey sport bottles.
[01:35:53.155 --> 01:35:56.800]  I mean, I keep mine in my purse because I carry a big old bag, you know.
[01:35:57.181 --> 01:36:00.246]  But I take it when I go in restaurants, you know.
[01:36:00.486 --> 01:36:03.851]  I just get water and pour it in my Berkey and squeeze it into the cup.
[01:36:04.491 --> 01:36:13.399]  I mean, if you taste water, the reason people are always drinking iced tea and soda and all that stuff is because they're masking the bad taste of the water.
[01:36:13.439 --> 01:36:16.262]  Well, I grew up in Dallas, where you're at, and it's really bad.
[01:36:16.282 --> 01:36:17.703]  Houston's the worst I've ever tasted.
[01:36:17.803 --> 01:36:18.784]  I know.
[01:36:18.864 --> 01:36:28.073]  Even Austin has, you know, supposedly better water, but they take it out of the aquifer and still send it through the treatment plant and get water out of the lakes and it tastes horrible.
[01:36:28.933 --> 01:36:32.575]  I mean, it's just simple, folks, and it's made in America, high quality product.
[01:36:32.895 --> 01:36:34.576]  Tell them about a couple of the specials, Debbie.
[01:36:34.856 --> 01:36:39.378]  Well, we have, you know, the Berkey Water Bottle, the Sport Bottle Special is still available.
[01:36:39.398 --> 01:36:41.940]  The five generic sport bottles for $99.
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:42.880]  They're a $39 value normally.
[01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:46.822]  And then we have the Berkey Light with the lights for $259, and with that you get two free gifts.
[01:36:56.501 --> 01:37:01.082]  Or you can get the Berkey Light without the lights, which is our most basic system, for only $199.
[01:37:01.122 --> 01:37:09.024]  And either of those come with, you know, the $199 one comes with a free gift.
[01:37:09.844 --> 01:37:11.784]  And you can get a free sport bottle with it.
[01:37:12.224 --> 01:37:16.405]  So then you have your water at home and you can have your water on the go.
[01:37:16.485 --> 01:37:22.387]  I mean, it's really cost effective as well as being so important to your health.
[01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:28.211]  You know, we really stand behind our product.
[01:37:28.291 --> 01:37:41.677]  If you have anything, you know, go wrong or you have concerns or questions... And this is a purification unit, you know, a cheap Indian knockoff, $300 at the camping supply store, folks.
[01:37:42.317 --> 01:37:43.778]  And this is made in America.
[01:37:44.138 --> 01:37:44.999]  A new standard.
[01:37:45.019 --> 01:37:46.300]  You know, we've gone over all this.
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:47.200]  It's a great system.
[01:37:47.521 --> 01:37:50.082]  And you get two free gifts with the $2.59 model.
[01:37:50.422 --> 01:37:52.684]  You get one free gift with the $1.99 model.
[01:37:52.704 --> 01:37:54.125]  Does tens of thousands of gallons.

[01:38:53.175 --> 01:38:53.635]  Take care.
[01:38:53.695 --> 01:38:55.176]  Now I'm going to accelerate into your calls.
[01:38:55.716 --> 01:38:57.057]  John in Tennessee.
[01:38:57.077 --> 01:38:58.718]  Go ahead, John, then Ken and others.
[01:38:59.198 --> 01:38:59.678]  Hi, Alex.
[01:39:00.059 --> 01:39:00.499]  Hello, John.
[01:39:00.871 --> 01:39:05.032]  Last night, our local TV news reported that John Edwards is from Tennessee.
[01:39:05.312 --> 01:39:10.534]  He started his career at a Republican law firm in Nashville, founded by current Republican U.S.
[01:39:10.574 --> 01:39:13.515]  Senator Lamar Alexander.
[01:39:13.615 --> 01:39:22.378]  Alexander is a former governor who ran the United Nations UNESCO Land Grab Trust Fund for George Bush, Sr., buying up land around national parks.
[01:39:23.258 --> 01:39:29.880]  And he ran for president several times, and each time he would pocket $20 million in tax-free campaign funds
[01:39:30.421 --> 01:39:33.123]  You know, politicians get to keep what they don't spend.
[01:39:33.843 --> 01:39:37.426]  And Tennessee is known as the Cayman Islands for campaign contributions.
[01:39:38.327 --> 01:39:49.434]  Now, Al Gore and Bill Blythe IV, who changed his name to Bill Clinton when he turned 18, declared that Alexander was, quote, the sleaziest politician in America, end quote.
[01:39:50.295 --> 01:39:56.079]  So it's like the TV news was saying, Edwards is a good guy, you know, it's a Republican TV station.
[01:39:56.499 --> 01:40:00.142]  They're saying to fellow Republicans, it's okay to vote for Edwards and Kerry, because
[01:40:00.763 --> 01:40:04.112]  Edwards is a good Republican and carries a good skull and bones.
[01:40:06.067 --> 01:40:06.767]  No, I know.
[01:40:06.988 --> 01:40:08.729]  And so it's a totally staged deal.
[01:40:08.749 --> 01:40:11.030]  That's why I say, go ahead and put them in.
[01:40:11.090 --> 01:40:13.351]  At least conservatives will wake up when it's Democrats.
[01:40:13.651 --> 01:40:14.872]  There's no difference, folks.
[01:40:15.632 --> 01:40:19.054]  And can you believe, did you hear me read the New York Times yesterday?
[01:40:19.074 --> 01:40:23.517]  I read it today, where they actually, I'm going to grab the quote and read it again here.
[01:40:23.557 --> 01:40:24.237]  I've got to do that.
[01:40:24.577 --> 01:40:28.380]  It's so incredible that, oh yeah, the Bilderberg Group, he stood up, gave a speech to them.
[01:40:28.420 --> 01:40:29.420]  They said, we want him.
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:34.163]  And they called Kerry, admitting that the Bilderberg Group selected John Edwards.
[01:40:34.727 --> 01:40:42.770]  Yeah, there's a lot of plagiarism going on where the mainline news claims credit for breaking a news story.
[01:40:43.710 --> 01:40:48.652]  Last night on Montel Williams' show, he interviewed Sylvia Brown, the Christian psychic.
[01:40:49.093 --> 01:40:55.475]  The last thing Brown said was, quote, I think we are going to find out that Osama Bin Laden is dead.
[01:40:55.615 --> 01:40:57.936]  I don't care how many tapes they put out, end quote.
[01:40:58.016 --> 01:40:59.196]  Then she walked off the set.
[01:41:01.388 --> 01:41:02.168]  Now it's official.
[01:41:02.768 --> 01:41:22.912]  And again, all these goofy psychics have to do is, you've got us two plus years ago saying he's dead, this is going to be a staged deal, now Senator Grassley, Madeleine Albright, and the latest this week, somebody else came out this week, Congressman McDermott and said it, and then they make enough predictions then some come true and they claim they're psychic, yeah.
[01:41:23.332 --> 01:41:29.693]  Yeah, it's a good ESP, but I like your website link about
[01:41:30.748 --> 01:41:32.148]  Yeah, I've got that here.
[01:41:32.168 --> 01:41:33.369]  Well, I mean, look.
[01:41:50.962 --> 01:41:52.563]  The Democrats just love Edwards.
[01:41:53.184 --> 01:41:54.745]  They just love Kerry.
[01:41:54.845 --> 01:41:56.646]  And the Republicans, oh, they're evil liberals.
[01:41:57.066 --> 01:41:59.448]  They have almost the exact same voting record as Bush.
[01:41:59.828 --> 01:42:01.189]  And they're all part of the same club.
[01:42:01.269 --> 01:42:05.172]  And they admit, they're trying to, look, we're exposing them.
[01:42:05.192 --> 01:42:08.114]  Because remember years ago, they said the Bilderberg Group didn't exist, John?
[01:42:08.414 --> 01:42:08.674]  Yeah.
[01:42:08.995 --> 01:42:12.517]  And then now it exists, and it's a good thing, and they want John Edwards.
[01:42:12.737 --> 01:42:16.600]  I like the New York Times did a 25-page hit piece on you.
[01:42:17.324 --> 01:42:20.849]  With John Ronson or Ron Johnson, whatever his name is.
[01:42:22.371 --> 01:42:27.137]  25 pages all about Alex Jones and how he's tied in with Osama Bin Laden and the Bilderberg Group.
[01:42:27.918 --> 01:42:28.819]  And Bohemian Grove.
[01:42:31.002 --> 01:42:31.883]  It was pretty bad.
[01:42:32.944 --> 01:42:33.846]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[01:42:36.491 --> 01:42:43.334]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:42:43.654 --> 01:42:45.014]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:42:45.214 --> 01:42:47.435]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:42:47.575 --> 01:42:49.656]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:42:49.936 --> 01:42:54.898]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:42:55.218 --> 01:42:59.240]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:01.261]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:43:01.341 --> 01:43:11.987]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:43:12.147 --> 01:43:14.049]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:43:14.249 --> 01:43:18.091]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the info war.
[01:43:18.211 --> 01:43:19.492]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[01:43:23.294 --> 01:43:24.916]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:43:25.097 --> 01:43:30.304]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[01:43:30.564 --> 01:43:31.265]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[01:43:35.965 --> 01:43:41.191]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:43:41.351 --> 01:43:49.441]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:43:49.701 --> 01:43:56.749]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:43:56.929 --> 01:43:58.190]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:43:58.290 --> 01:44:04.175]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:44:04.375 --> 01:44:09.459]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:44:09.579 --> 01:44:18.447]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:44:18.727 --> 01:44:22.009]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:44:24.111 --> 01:44:24.631]  We're good to go!
[01:44:52.182 --> 01:44:52.823]  We're good to go.

[01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:43.401]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:45:43.881 --> 01:45:46.782]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:45:48.362 --> 01:45:52.744]  Yeah, what John of Tennessee was talking about a few years ago.
[01:45:54.805 --> 01:46:02.227]  They did an hour-long hit piece that I was brought up in many times on C-SPAN about Bohemian Grove, how it doesn't exist, how I'm crazy.
[01:46:04.921 --> 01:46:09.022]  And then there was a New York Times book review piece that comes out in kind of a weekly magazine.
[01:46:09.062 --> 01:46:10.563]  I didn't even ever get the original copy of that.
[01:46:10.583 --> 01:46:16.685]  I saw their online shorter version that was about three pages long and it bashed me quite a bit.
[01:46:16.765 --> 01:46:19.226]  And Alex Jones believes there's a new world order.
[01:46:19.266 --> 01:46:21.086]  He believes in a place called Bohemian Grove.
[01:46:21.527 --> 01:46:25.768]  Then they mixed into the article, you know, this is what Bin Laden's up to.
[01:46:25.808 --> 01:46:27.429]  It was all like guilt by association.
[01:46:27.469 --> 01:46:28.549]  Just wild stuff.
[01:46:30.231 --> 01:46:32.012]  And Alex believes in the Bilderberg Group.
[01:46:32.612 --> 01:46:35.534]  He believes in these fantastic organizations.
[01:46:35.874 --> 01:46:38.735]  I mean, just a few years ago, these groups didn't exist, folks.
[01:46:40.136 --> 01:46:45.439]  And now, oh, they wanted Edwards, so he's the VP pick of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:47.640]  They wanted it, so they got it.
[01:46:49.481 --> 01:46:50.702]  It's getting pretty ridiculous.
[01:46:50.742 --> 01:46:54.624]  Before I go to Ken and Sheila and Debbie, we're going to get to all of you.
[01:46:54.644 --> 01:46:56.765]  We've got Galen Ross coming up later in the next hour.
[01:46:58.297 --> 01:47:01.601]  Before I do that, just briefly, I've made ten films, written a book, published a book.
[01:47:02.061 --> 01:47:05.264]  I'm carrying a bunch of new videos on 9-11, one of them by George Humphrey.
[01:47:05.284 --> 01:47:08.488]  9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati.
[01:47:09.637 --> 01:47:12.099]  It's $19.95 on VHS or DVD.
[01:47:12.119 --> 01:47:17.763]  Get a free 80-plus page color booklet that goes with it, 9-11, The Great Illusion booklet.
[01:47:18.263 --> 01:47:19.664]  Get a second copy for $14.95.
[01:47:20.444 --> 01:47:25.388]  And when you buy one copy and get three booklets, so there's three booklets and two videos, for $34.95.
[01:47:25.748 --> 01:47:29.170]  My films drop down from $25.95 to $20 a piece.
[01:47:29.771 --> 01:47:35.955]  When you order three or more, whether it's 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, or Masters of Terror, or Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove,

[01:47:40.123 --> 01:47:45.348]  It's the best stuff I've found that we've got on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:47:46.229 --> 01:47:46.550]  Get them.
[01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:47.751]  Show them to people.
[01:47:47.811 --> 01:47:48.592]  Wake folks up.
[01:47:48.892 --> 01:47:51.955]  That's why they're having to come out and admit all this now and put their spin on it.
[01:47:52.195 --> 01:47:56.580]  It's because we've been exposing it so long and their stonewalling is backfiring on them.
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:57.861]  We're having an effect.
[01:47:57.922 --> 01:47:59.203]  The people are waking up.
[01:47:59.898 --> 01:48:09.300]  And your support is also vital, so 1-888-253-3139 is the toll free number to order the videos, or books, or any of it.

[01:48:41.129 --> 01:48:41.990]  Ken in Texas.
[01:48:42.030 --> 01:48:42.870]  Ken, you're on the air.
[01:48:42.930 --> 01:48:43.250]  Welcome.
[01:48:45.618 --> 01:48:46.439]  Hello, Ken.
[01:48:46.479 --> 01:48:47.220]  You're on the air.
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:47.620]  Welcome.
[01:48:47.780 --> 01:48:48.241]  Can you hear me?
[01:48:48.441 --> 01:48:48.962]  Yes, I can.
[01:48:48.982 --> 01:48:54.988]  Hey, I'm going to play your, uh, takeover video Friday on cable access here in Fort Worth on cable 28.
[01:48:55.309 --> 01:48:56.009]  Good, thank you.
[01:48:56.270 --> 01:48:57.371]  And I use a Perky.
[01:48:57.391 --> 01:48:58.192]  It works fine.
[01:48:58.392 --> 01:49:02.817]  Number two is, uh, you see the pictures of Edwards with his communist fist salute sticking up?
[01:49:03.433 --> 01:49:05.094]  Well, you know, I've got to be honest about that.
[01:49:05.215 --> 01:49:09.398]  He's communistic because of his elite actions and his voting record.
[01:49:09.758 --> 01:49:13.381]  You know, there's photos of me at speeches doing a clench fist.
[01:49:13.401 --> 01:49:15.643]  People have done that for 10,000 years.
[01:49:16.384 --> 01:49:21.428]  But, obviously, they script what they do, so there is some credence to what you say.
[01:49:21.588 --> 01:49:25.111]  I'm going to write, I've written Kerry Poe and ask him to restore his design.
[01:49:25.352 --> 01:49:27.754]  I'm going to write Edward Stormer's design and tell him I saw his
[01:49:28.374 --> 01:49:31.756]  His name in the Bilderberg party over in Strasse, Italy.
[01:49:32.036 --> 01:49:32.997]  And I'm going to tell what's in it.
[01:49:33.017 --> 01:49:34.457]  And also, they had the pictures in it.
[01:49:34.477 --> 01:49:36.378]  See the pictures in the American Free Press?
[01:49:36.699 --> 01:49:39.920]  Yes, but can you believe that the New York... Did you see it?
[01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:45.944]  The New York Times came out yesterday and said, oh, the Bilderberg group said they wanted him to be VP.
[01:49:45.984 --> 01:49:48.425]  They're actually throwing it in our face.
[01:49:48.485 --> 01:49:48.725]  Right!
[01:49:50.346 --> 01:49:51.026]  That's what they're doing.
[01:49:51.066 --> 01:49:51.927]  They don't care anymore.
[01:49:51.947 --> 01:49:53.868]  They've lost control and they know it.
[01:49:54.349 --> 01:49:58.452]  Now we're going to make sure they lose control and I'm going to play your video on Friday night.
[01:49:58.712 --> 01:49:59.533]  Good job Ken.
[01:49:59.573 --> 01:50:00.133]  Anything else?
[01:50:00.233 --> 01:50:00.613]  That's it.
[01:50:00.694 --> 01:50:01.174]  Friday later.
[01:50:01.414 --> 01:50:02.115]  Good to hear from you.
[01:50:02.155 --> 01:50:03.395]  Thanks for holding to tell us that.
[01:50:03.776 --> 01:50:08.559]  Sheila, Debbie, Bob, Billy, all of you.
[01:50:08.579 --> 01:50:09.520]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:09.580]  800-259-9231.
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:09.660]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:50:16.212 --> 01:50:19.756]  And later in the next hour, we've got Robert Gaylon Ross coming up to give us his forecast.
[01:50:19.776 --> 01:50:22.478]  Former NSA officer and an author, good friend of mine.
[01:50:22.839 --> 01:50:24.400]  He'll be joining us from Central Texas.
[01:50:24.420 --> 01:50:24.901]  Stay with us.
[01:51:00.401 --> 01:51:02.482]  Reporter joining us.
[01:51:03.223 --> 01:51:08.326]  Talk about John Edwards, the Bilderberg minion, the New York Times and the Bilderberg group wanted him so they got him.
[01:51:09.147 --> 01:51:13.970]  Just a bunch of other news I haven't even gotten to yet and we'll cover it all with our guest.
[01:51:14.370 --> 01:51:18.853]  Right now let's go to Cheryl in Ohio, then we'll go to Debbie and others.
[01:51:18.933 --> 01:51:19.814]  Cheryl, go ahead.
[01:51:22.015 --> 01:51:23.256]  You're on the air, Cheryl.
[01:51:24.937 --> 01:51:26.418]  Alright, guess she's not there.
[01:51:28.083 --> 01:51:39.039]  I just want to say one thing that you have not touched on, but next week the House and Senate are voting and we should speak up about calling our
[01:51:39.997 --> 01:51:43.939]  Well, I tell you, on top of it, have you heard that Bush is saying that our troops will be under U.N.
[01:51:44.079 --> 01:51:45.620]  authority under the criminal court now?
[01:51:45.660 --> 01:51:48.602]  And the neocons aren't saying a word about that!
[01:52:09.542 --> 01:52:21.628]  Well, they're not saying a word about a lot of things, but what I'm saying here is that marriage is a sanctity between one man, one woman, not Adam and Steve here.
[01:52:21.768 --> 01:52:22.308]  No, I agree.
[01:52:22.348 --> 01:52:24.189]  That institution needs to be defended.
[01:52:24.569 --> 01:52:25.030]  And it does.
[01:52:25.050 --> 01:52:26.850]  But I wouldn't look for the federal government to do it.
[01:52:26.890 --> 01:52:32.393]  Their job, their stated goal at the Department of Education is to destroy the family.
[01:52:32.553 --> 01:52:34.734]  Is to destroy the family, absolutely.
[01:52:34.754 --> 01:52:35.855]  I agree with you.
[01:52:43.001 --> 01:53:10.901]  I just want to say one thing that you have not touched on, but next week, the House and Senate are voting, and we should speak up about calling our Senators, even though it's just one voice... ...in jail for reading a passage from the Bible offending homosexuals, and again, if you're going to take his First Amendment, his free speech, they're going to take yours, and they're trying to pass laws like that here, a Republican governor did in Pennsylvania,
[01:53:12.319 --> 01:53:14.220]  Again, it's like Communist China, folks.
[01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:16.261]  Well, you don't want to be mean to a group, do you?
[01:53:16.641 --> 01:53:17.502]  You see how that works?
[01:53:17.562 --> 01:53:18.983]  Now it's everybody's free speech.
[01:53:19.303 --> 01:53:20.903]  Well, it's going to be your free speech, too.
[01:53:20.964 --> 01:53:21.384]  Believe me.
[01:53:22.344 --> 01:53:24.325]  Let's go ahead and talk to Debbie in California.
[01:53:24.345 --> 01:53:25.046]  Debbie, go ahead.
[01:53:25.066 --> 01:53:25.786]  Hi.
[01:53:26.406 --> 01:53:26.686]  Hello.
[01:53:27.267 --> 01:53:27.387]  Hi.
[01:53:27.527 --> 01:53:28.968]  Have you heard of David Icke?
[01:53:29.988 --> 01:53:31.869]  Yes, we've had him on before.
[01:53:32.269 --> 01:53:32.610]  Okay.
[01:53:32.850 --> 01:53:37.212]  I agree with about 95% of what he has to say, and then he goes off into other things.
[01:53:37.938 --> 01:53:44.343]  Yeah, and he speaks of Bohemian Grove and everything, and has some pictures that you actually took, I believe.
[01:53:44.443 --> 01:53:45.965]  Yeah, no, he gives me credit.
[01:53:46.525 --> 01:53:46.785]  Uh-huh.
[01:53:47.366 --> 01:53:51.569]  Well, what I wanted to ask you is, um, I have a challenge for you.
[01:53:51.589 --> 01:53:52.730]  Uh-huh.
[01:53:53.211 --> 01:54:00.316]  I would like to know if, uh, I mean, I would like to explain that if you... You know those satellites that are around the Earth?
[01:54:00.356 --> 01:54:02.018]  There's several hundred of them.
[01:54:02.979 --> 01:54:05.841]  And a lot of companies own those satellites, correct?
[01:54:06.317 --> 01:54:06.577]  Yes.
[01:54:06.918 --> 01:54:12.844]  Is a private party like you, for instance, allowed to rent one of those at any time?
[01:54:12.864 --> 01:54:15.747]  Yeah, if I had millions of dollars.
[01:54:16.167 --> 01:54:22.594]  An audio feed is, I don't know, like $5,000 a month, and the network pays for several of those.
[01:54:23.495 --> 01:54:27.579]  Yeah, well, if you have somebody new in the business or something like that, you could
[01:54:28.064 --> 01:54:32.427]  You could use one of those satellites and it's supposed to go all the way down and read a license plate.
[01:54:32.907 --> 01:54:35.029]  Why couldn't it go to the Bohemian Grove?
[01:54:35.689 --> 01:54:40.953]  Because they have national security on those and won't allow companies to release those photos.
[01:54:41.933 --> 01:54:43.695]  You can't go out and rent one.
[01:54:44.115 --> 01:54:46.457]  Actually, one company was doing that and they got in a lot of trouble.
[01:54:47.377 --> 01:54:49.258]  Did they ever keep the tapes so people could steal?
[01:54:49.278 --> 01:54:50.599]  Well, no, they didn't do Bohemian Grove.
[01:54:50.619 --> 01:54:52.180]  The point is there was a company that was doing that.
[01:54:52.461 --> 01:54:54.482]  It would go take photos of whatever you wanted.
[01:54:56.007 --> 01:55:01.210]  It just doesn't seem like, you know, they should be able to expose this if it's really true.
[01:55:01.230 --> 01:55:02.651]  Bohemia Grove has been exposed.
[01:55:02.691 --> 01:55:04.392]  I got a two hour video of it.
[01:55:04.652 --> 01:55:05.773]  They admit I snuck in.
[01:55:05.793 --> 01:55:07.814]  They say Satan worship is Christian.
[01:55:07.834 --> 01:55:08.735]  I mean, they actually say that.
[01:55:08.775 --> 01:55:10.836]  And they're just having fun worshipping Moloch.
[01:55:10.896 --> 01:55:14.418]  And the Christian groups say that it's good and Skull and Bones is good.
[01:55:15.539 --> 01:55:19.121]  They say that worshipping Satan is a good thing and that we should all do it.
[01:55:19.141 --> 01:55:19.762]  We'll be right back.
[01:55:19.782 --> 01:55:20.102]  Stay with us.
[01:55:30.842 --> 01:55:36.327]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:55:36.747 --> 01:55:40.990]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:55:41.231 --> 01:55:48.256]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:55:48.637 --> 01:55:54.742]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:55:54.882 --> 01:55:56.103]  There are no side effects.
[01:55:56.443 --> 01:55:59.385]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:55:59.545 --> 01:56:01.566]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:56:01.866 --> 01:56:09.110]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:56:09.410 --> 01:56:12.792]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:29.061]  Terrorism!
[01:56:29.201 --> 01:56:29.961]  Terrorism!
[01:56:30.061 --> 01:56:36.126]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:56:36.386 --> 01:56:37.988]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:56:38.208 --> 01:56:40.690]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:56:41.090 --> 01:56:55.661]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:56:55.701 --> 01:56:56.001]  government.
[01:56:56.182 --> 01:56:57.983]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:56:58.343 --> 01:57:04.264]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:57:04.384 --> 01:57:08.905]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[01:57:28.277 --> 01:57:31.220]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:57:31.881 --> 01:57:33.163]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:57:33.363 --> 01:57:39.109]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:57:39.390 --> 01:57:44.656]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:57:44.936 --> 01:57:46.558]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order
[01:57:46.718 --> 01:57:49.099]  The program for world domination has blown wide open.
[01:57:49.239 --> 01:57:53.020]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:57.922]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:57:58.022 --> 01:58:00.783]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[01:58:01.083 --> 01:58:04.264]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[01:58:04.324 --> 01:58:06.145]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:58:06.525 --> 01:58:06.805]  Big Brother.
[01:58:34.369 --> 01:58:35.410]  Mainstream media.
[01:58:36.130 --> 01:58:37.210]  Government cover-ups.
[01:58:37.891 --> 01:58:38.711]  You want answers?
[01:58:39.471 --> 01:58:40.352]  Well, so does he.
[01:58:40.372 --> 01:58:44.854]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:45.214 --> 01:58:49.336]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:53.558 --> 01:58:54.398]  Okay, folks.
[01:58:54.618 --> 01:58:59.481]  I know we've got Carol and Warren and Matthew and Will and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:58:59.501 --> 01:59:02.342]  We'll get to your calls early in this first hour.
[01:59:04.272 --> 01:59:22.327]  In this last hour, I should say, this hour that we've got left, Freudian Slip, I wish it was our first hour we could get to more information with Robert Dillon Ross, who worked for the NSA, then worked as an international oil company consultant, lived all over the world, Middle East, you name it.
[01:59:24.068 --> 01:59:30.213]  Good friend of mine, he just got interviewed last week by National British Sky Television News, I did as well, they said that they liked our interview with him.
[01:59:30.930 --> 01:59:32.691]  It'll be interesting to see how that piece goes.
[01:59:32.951 --> 01:59:34.612]  Oh, I'm glad I got Gale in on.
[01:59:34.632 --> 01:59:36.893]  I just forgot about another TV network that just called us.
[01:59:36.953 --> 01:59:38.493]  I need to call Robert and tell him about that.
[01:59:39.314 --> 01:59:42.155]  I keep forgetting to call that TV network back.
[01:59:43.135 --> 01:59:48.978]  One reason I decided to get him on on short notice is this headline, Bilderberg Performance Key to Edwards VP Pick.
[01:59:50.226 --> 02:00:03.233]  And the New York Times, according to a report in the New York Times by Jody Wilgrun, analyzing why Kerry chose Edwards over other 24 serious contenders for the number two spot.
[02:00:03.333 --> 02:00:15.579]  Quote, several people pointed to the secretive and exclusive Bilderberg conference of the some 120 people that this year drew the likes of Henry A. Kissinger, Melinda Gates, and Richard A. Pearl.
[02:00:17.154 --> 02:00:21.117]  to Italy in early June as helping win Mr. Kerry's heart.
[02:00:21.498 --> 02:00:27.523]  Mr. Edwards spoke so well in a debate on American politics with a Republican, Ralph Reed.
[02:00:27.543 --> 02:00:29.945]  Oh, the Christian Coalition guy was there.
[02:00:30.345 --> 02:00:34.768]  The participants broke Bilderberg rules to clap before the end of the session.
[02:00:35.089 --> 02:00:38.972]  Beforehand, Mr. Edwards traveled to Brussels to meet with NATO officials
[02:00:39.612 --> 02:00:41.833]  Brandishing his foreign policy credentials.
[02:00:41.893 --> 02:00:46.976]  Quote, his performance at Bilderberg was important, said a friend of Mr. Carey who was there at Bilderberg.
[02:00:47.577 --> 02:00:49.357]  He reported back directly to Carey.
[02:00:50.158 --> 02:00:51.959]  There were other reports on his performance.
[02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:59.143]  Whether they reported directly or indirectly, I have no doubt the word got back to Mr. Carey and how well he did.
[02:00:59.163 --> 02:01:04.866]  And they go on to say that they picked Mr. Edwards because the Bilderberg group liked him.
[02:01:05.797 --> 02:01:15.627]  And back in 91, they sent Bill Clinton, the upstart governor, and then George Bush was told, you step down, this is the boy, they had 11 meetings, staged that whole deal, Bush Sr.
[02:01:15.707 --> 02:01:22.895]  didn't even campaign, this is staged people, and to give us his insight and study on this, he's written Who's Who of the Elite,
[02:01:24.510 --> 02:01:28.551]  JFK, MLK, RFK, you know, the elite serial killers.
[02:01:29.011 --> 02:01:30.732]  I mean, a lot of great work.
[02:01:31.312 --> 02:01:33.693]  Joining us is Robert Galen Ross, my good buddy.
[02:01:34.373 --> 02:01:47.016]  And Galen, looking at this just in a nutshell, the Mildenberg Group, what we know about it, and these amazing admissions by the New York Times that they're the kingmakers, this is a major shift.
[02:01:47.256 --> 02:01:48.216]  What do you see happening?
[02:01:49.036 --> 02:01:50.677]  It's a pleasure to be with you again, Alex.
[02:01:51.755 --> 02:01:55.496]  You know, there's another phenomenon that went on about the same time.
[02:01:56.577 --> 02:02:10.501]  Was it a coincidence that George W. Bush went to Rome to meet with the Pope, and he overnighted after meeting with the Pope in Milan, which was very near the Bilderberg meeting at that time, so he was also at the Bilderberg meeting.
[02:02:14.079 --> 02:02:24.888]  Edwards were sent to the Bilderbergs because it would have been too obvious for Terry to show up because the Patriots would certainly have picked him out and reported to the world.
[02:02:26.149 --> 02:02:27.370]  And he couldn't stand that.
[02:02:27.390 --> 02:02:33.795]  And exactly, at the very same time, Bush is in Italy and many of his hours are missing.
[02:02:34.235 --> 02:02:41.321]  Then we have Bush and the other leaders going from getting their orders at Bilderberg back to the G8, martial law in Georgia.
[02:02:42.815 --> 02:02:45.818]  Absolutely.
[02:02:46.498 --> 02:03:02.311]  You and I have discussed many times that the Bilderbergs decide everything of significance all over the entire world, including world leaders.
[02:03:02.791 --> 02:03:08.836]  This is absolutely the strongest clue I've gotten in a long time that Kerry will be the next president.
[02:03:09.856 --> 02:03:16.560]  And as I said, he couldn't be there because it would be too obvious, so he sent Edwards there to represent him.
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:25.905]  And I wonder if any of the people that are interviewing Kerry and Edwards as they're going around the country will ask him about the Bilderberg meeting.
[02:03:26.505 --> 02:03:35.130]  Why do you think we've seen this shift from the globalists being for Bush to over to Kerry and Edwards?
[02:03:35.590 --> 02:03:39.052]  I really think they're afraid that Bush is too inept.
[02:03:39.386 --> 02:03:39.566]  Yes.
[02:03:57.694 --> 02:03:59.836]  Also with skull and bones as Bush is.
[02:04:00.116 --> 02:04:03.498]  Well also Bush has served out as usefulness at one level.
[02:04:03.538 --> 02:04:05.940]  I'm not sure that he's not still going to win as if it even matters.
[02:04:06.821 --> 02:04:10.263]  It does matter at a certain level because conservatives have been asleep while he's been in office.
[02:04:11.064 --> 02:04:14.987]  They need us to play the bad cop in Iraq while the UN looks like the good cop.
[02:04:15.307 --> 02:04:18.249]  That's now happened as I predicted a year before the war even started.
[02:04:18.269 --> 02:04:19.470]  It wasn't hard to do.
[02:04:19.510 --> 02:04:23.613]  We got this out of Bilderberg back in the 2002 January meeting.
[02:04:23.894 --> 02:04:25.115]  How does all that tie together?
[02:04:27.775 --> 02:04:29.757]  It ties in perfectly.
[02:04:29.777 --> 02:04:50.195]  Also, you'll find that Cheney is getting a lot of spotlight and Bush won't dump him, so they may need to get Cheney out and they'll just let him go with Bush because they need to accomplish their goal, which is to create the Global Union by 2005, or the American Union by 2005.
[02:04:52.916 --> 02:04:55.858]  And again, it's already basically 90% set up.
[02:04:55.898 --> 02:04:58.500]  They even are choosing their capital of Atlanta.
[02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:00.261]  They're debating Miami or Atlanta.
[02:05:00.281 --> 02:05:02.502]  Looks like Atlanta will be the headquarters.
[02:05:02.542 --> 02:05:06.425]  But the average American doesn't even know that our own EU is forming.
[02:05:06.925 --> 02:05:07.526]  That's correct.
[02:05:08.426 --> 02:05:13.630]  And almost no one knows that the African Union was formed back in July of 2000.
[02:05:14.130 --> 02:05:17.092]  There were 53 nations of Africa.
[02:05:17.994 --> 02:05:21.495]  Created the African Union, which is a carbon copy of the European Union.
[02:05:21.575 --> 02:05:23.015]  Now, it's the same thing with the EU.
[02:05:23.255 --> 02:05:30.236]  The people of Europe didn't know it was going to be a real government until their leaders all set it up without a vote even being held.
[02:05:30.476 --> 02:05:31.037]  That's right.
[02:05:31.257 --> 02:05:43.819]  It was slipped in from the back side, and now they're fixing to present the Constitution for the European Union, which will nullify all constitutions of all the nations of the
[02:05:44.534 --> 02:05:45.335]  European Union.
[02:05:45.415 --> 02:05:48.498]  And by the way, criticism of the government is an arrestable offense.
[02:05:49.439 --> 02:05:50.220]  Here's Sweden.
[02:05:50.240 --> 02:05:56.366]  A Swedish pastor sentenced to one month in jail for offending homosexuals by reading a Bible passage.
[02:05:57.147 --> 02:05:57.968]  Now isn't that something?
[02:05:58.308 --> 02:05:59.569]  Sounds like Communist China.
[02:05:59.890 --> 02:06:01.792]  Yeah.
[02:06:01.872 --> 02:06:07.558]  But that'll be continuing to tighten up all over the world.
[02:06:10.190 --> 02:06:15.975]  As the Patriot Act 2 comes rolling out, we'll probably see a lot of that being included in that.
[02:06:18.517 --> 02:06:32.189]  Robert, I've been saying that Bush is so arrogant that he thinks he's going to win, that I thought he was going to win, and I'm rarely wrong because he's gotten so much of the agenda through, but I have to admit that all the indicators show Kerry Edwards
[02:06:34.122 --> 02:06:53.805]  Unless there is a real shift and a fissure between the Anglo-American establishment and the Rothschild power arm in Europe, but you and I agree that there isn't a real power divide, only that they allow certain bodies of the New World Order to compete with each other, thus for the vigor of the overall entity, what do you see happening?
[02:06:54.205 --> 02:06:57.607]  Well, it's just like a professional wrestling match.
[02:06:57.667 --> 02:07:04.010]  If you think that the wrestlers don't know who's going to win before they ever enter the ring, you've got something else coming.
[02:07:05.871 --> 02:07:14.776]  All of this is planned, and they will have little struggling matches here and there from one side to the other just to get your attention off the real facts.
[02:07:16.497 --> 02:07:19.419]  And to balkanize us back into a left-right false debate.
[02:07:19.579 --> 02:07:20.079]  That's correct.
[02:07:21.169 --> 02:07:22.350]  And you can pick either side.
[02:07:22.630 --> 02:07:25.991]  They're still going to accomplish their goal.
[02:07:27.852 --> 02:07:28.953]  And their goal is?
[02:07:29.633 --> 02:07:32.735]  The creation of a global union or a new world order.
[02:07:35.756 --> 02:07:39.638]  My favorite term is global union, but there's a lot of other terms used for it.
[02:07:39.718 --> 02:07:40.059]  That's right.
[02:07:40.079 --> 02:07:41.499]  They go, we're not for global government.
[02:07:41.519 --> 02:07:46.702]  We're for global governance and global union, which is the exact same thing in the encyclopedia or dictionary.
[02:07:46.842 --> 02:07:47.262]  That's right.
[02:07:51.801 --> 02:08:00.428]  The Council of America meeting a year ago, Dick Cheney said that they will complete the Free Trade Area of America by January 2005.
[02:08:01.029 --> 02:08:04.592]  And that was in Mexico and they said we're going to have a global tax.
[02:08:05.407 --> 02:08:11.391]  A gas tax and a national sales tax that will really be international.
[02:08:11.672 --> 02:08:15.194]  And we have the neocons pushing this as if it's conservative.
[02:08:15.534 --> 02:08:32.247]  Yeah, and now all of this, if done by the people in our elected positions in our government, they're committing treason because they swear an oath when they take their position that they will defend the Constitution and the
[02:08:33.226 --> 02:08:36.228]  The elite are determined to eliminate our Constitution.
[02:08:37.909 --> 02:08:48.154]  Well, we can see the last vestiges of the Republic being swept away, martial law being openly discussed, militarization of police, giant prisons being built everywhere.
[02:08:48.514 --> 02:08:51.436]  Galen, what's America going to be like if the New World Order succeeds?
[02:08:52.777 --> 02:09:00.701]  It'll be... You'll have concentration camps for those that resist, and they'll
[02:09:01.758 --> 02:09:05.119]  We're going to end up as a police state.
[02:09:25.322 --> 02:09:28.303]  Well, I agree with you if they succeed.
[02:09:28.343 --> 02:09:40.746]  The problem is, Robert Galen Ross, I see a huge awakening, I see their own minions not following orders, I see leaks at all levels, and I see that they don't have enough evil people to carry it out on a mass scale.
[02:09:40.786 --> 02:09:45.167]  Maybe in Russia, maybe in Vietnam, maybe in China, but I see them having real problems here.
[02:09:46.010 --> 02:09:49.694]  Well, I'm convinced that we're going to be able to stop them, Alex.
[02:09:50.674 --> 02:09:58.182]  And we just have to inform 5% of the public of what's going on and there will be enough protest that they'll stop them.
[02:09:58.302 --> 02:10:00.404]  And I don't like to waste my time like you do.
[02:10:01.124 --> 02:10:05.448]  And you and I wouldn't be doing what we're doing if we thought we were going to fail.
[02:10:05.528 --> 02:10:07.670]  We're going to accomplish what we're doing.
[02:10:07.691 --> 02:10:10.233]  Let's expose what's really going on.
[02:10:11.070 --> 02:10:12.031]  All right, my friend.
[02:10:12.091 --> 02:10:18.618]  Robert Galen Ross, former NSA, international oil company consultant, lived all over the world, good friend of mine, author.
[02:10:18.958 --> 02:10:20.700]  Your call is straight ahead when we get back.
[02:10:21.221 --> 02:10:21.761]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:10:29.830 --> 02:10:34.333]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:10:34.694 --> 02:10:38.757]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:10:39.077 --> 02:10:39.617]  We listened.
[02:10:39.917 --> 02:10:44.901]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:10:45.181 --> 02:10:45.662]  We listened.
[02:10:46.042 --> 02:10:49.084]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:10:49.524 --> 02:10:50.045]  We listened.
[02:10:50.505 --> 02:10:54.567]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:10:54.948 --> 02:10:55.428]  We listened.
[02:10:55.788 --> 02:11:01.011]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:11:01.431 --> 02:11:02.792]  Again, we listened.
[02:11:03.152 --> 02:11:10.537]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:11:10.917 --> 02:11:14.379]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[02:11:28.153 --> 02:11:29.694]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:11:29.854 --> 02:11:30.994]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:11:31.154 --> 02:11:34.575]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:11:34.675 --> 02:11:35.115]  Phenol!
[02:11:35.435 --> 02:11:42.498]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:11:43.018 --> 02:11:46.922]  ETA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:11:47.042 --> 02:11:47.502]  Fragrance?
[02:11:47.863 --> 02:11:52.627]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:11:52.767 --> 02:11:57.472]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[02:11:57.692 --> 02:12:00.255]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Calben shampoo.
[02:12:00.495 --> 02:12:03.918]  Well, like all of the products from the Calben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:12:04.058 --> 02:12:07.562]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:12:07.782 --> 02:12:10.145]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:12:10.325 --> 02:12:11.206]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:12:34.852 --> 02:12:37.935]  What kinds of investments will be able to withstand an economic meltdown?
[02:12:38.055 --> 02:12:40.597]  The problem is, it's not always easy to find great solutions.
[02:12:40.758 --> 02:12:44.401]  And during these dangerous economic times, finding the right solution is crucial.

[02:13:23.857 --> 02:13:24.438]  Do it today.
[02:13:24.498 --> 02:13:25.479]  You'll be glad you did.
[02:13:28.613 --> 02:13:30.915]  My family's breathing easier, and now you can too!
[02:13:31.095 --> 02:13:34.457]  Hey folks, Michael Trudell here to tell you about the Biozone Air Purifier.
[02:13:34.558 --> 02:13:36.759]  The Biozone Air Purifier is not a filter system.
[02:13:36.939 --> 02:13:42.904]  It works at the molecular level, binding the small bits of dust, allergens, and other particles in your air into clumps that are too heavy to float.
[02:13:43.104 --> 02:13:45.686]  They fall harmlessly to the floor to be literally swept away.
[02:13:45.946 --> 02:13:46.607]  Nothing escapes!
[02:13:46.727 --> 02:13:50.950]  The Biozone Air Purifier also kills virus and bacteria germs and totally removes odors.
[02:13:51.130 --> 02:13:54.753]  Out on the farm we have several cats and two big dogs, so pet odors can be a concern.
[02:13:54.873 --> 02:13:57.134]  But like the odors from anything else, simply gone.
[02:13:57.355 --> 02:13:57.695]  Smoke?
[02:13:57.895 --> 02:13:59.756]  My wife and I don't, but several of our friends do.
[02:13:59.936 --> 02:14:02.997]  Our BioZone Air Purifier clears out that smoke literally within minutes.
[02:14:03.217 --> 02:14:07.318]  I use it myself, and I'm telling you, your BioZone Air Purifier will improve the air in your home.
[02:14:07.478 --> 02:14:10.139]  It even comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee and free shipping.
[02:14:10.319 --> 02:14:13.080]  Call toll-free, 888-88-MY-AIR today.
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:15.540]  That's 1-888-88-MY-AIR.
[02:14:15.660 --> 02:14:18.601]  Or visit www.purifymyair.com.
[02:14:18.681 --> 02:14:20.322]  That's purifymyair.com.

[02:14:23.943 --> 02:14:26.904]  Get your BioZone Air Purifier today, and you'll be breathing easier, too.
[02:14:43.929 --> 02:14:50.875]  We already have the most imprisoned, force-drugged, dumbed-down population on the planet.
[02:14:51.815 --> 02:14:52.856]  It's already upon us.
[02:14:52.916 --> 02:14:54.738]  It's what degree of tyranny will we accept?
[02:14:55.098 --> 02:14:58.841]  Robert Galen Ross, let's take a few calls and we'll get more into the New World Order as this develops.
[02:14:58.981 --> 02:14:59.722]  Honored to have you.
[02:15:00.482 --> 02:15:03.125]  Tell folks about some of your books and materials later in the broadcast.
[02:15:03.665 --> 02:15:05.607]  Carol in Mississippi, you're on the air.
[02:15:05.667 --> 02:15:06.007]  Welcome.
[02:15:07.228 --> 02:15:07.868]  Yes, I know.
[02:15:07.948 --> 02:15:12.232]  Do you know about the... Is there a book out about the Skull and Bones Society?
[02:15:12.914 --> 02:15:15.555]  Well, there's a bunch of books out about it.
[02:15:15.736 --> 02:15:16.116]  Okay.
[02:15:17.416 --> 02:15:19.577]  And there's one called Fleshing Out Skull and Bones.
[02:15:19.597 --> 02:15:22.939]  We've interviewed the author and he's gotten some national attention.
[02:15:23.339 --> 02:15:26.101]  Alexandra Robbins kind of writes a whitewash about it.
[02:15:26.141 --> 02:15:30.803]  She's a member of the other elite society next door called Scroll and Key.
[02:15:31.643 --> 02:15:32.043]  Go ahead.
[02:15:32.484 --> 02:15:33.984]  Okay, I don't even know about that one.
[02:15:34.004 --> 02:15:37.106]  I learned about this one, I guess, from you and someone else on shortwave.
[02:15:37.666 --> 02:15:40.127]  But I went to get someone.
[02:15:40.147 --> 02:15:41.128]  I didn't have a computer.
[02:15:41.704 --> 02:15:47.148]  And I know you know it goes back, um, it's Yale, that's where they're all from.
[02:15:47.268 --> 02:15:51.791]  Uh-huh, 1832, founded with British money by the Germans to overthrow the U.S., that's admitted.
[02:15:51.811 --> 02:15:54.433]  Right, and that's Hitler's symbol.
[02:15:55.113 --> 02:15:56.635]  Right, that's Hitler's symbol, right?
[02:15:56.955 --> 02:16:01.558]  Yeah, and Tony Sutton wrote a book about it for the American establishment also.
[02:16:02.319 --> 02:16:06.101]  Okay, and also, uh, Schwarzenegger, doesn't he wear a ring like that?
[02:16:06.842 --> 02:16:08.643]  His daddy was in the, uh, Nazi.
[02:16:09.782 --> 02:16:10.984]  I don't have any idea.
[02:16:11.044 --> 02:16:12.225]  I've heard that somewhere.
[02:16:12.505 --> 02:16:15.148]  The Skull and Bones, ma'am, came before the Nazis.
[02:16:15.308 --> 02:16:15.548]  Yeah.
[02:16:15.869 --> 02:16:16.770]  Okay, I know that.
[02:16:17.030 --> 02:16:17.611]  Let me just tell you.
[02:16:17.931 --> 02:16:23.097]  It's an Illuminati chapter, and so their symbol, it's the Order of Death.
[02:16:23.397 --> 02:16:23.737]  I know.
[02:16:23.958 --> 02:16:26.200]  Okay, so their symbol is the Skull and Bones.
[02:16:26.240 --> 02:16:28.863]  So it's not good at all in any way you can look at it.
[02:16:29.123 --> 02:16:31.566]  It's just, they've got destroying and death.
[02:16:32.166 --> 02:16:43.532]  Three years ago, video was released of one of the rituals, which they admit is satanic worship, but the Christian Coalition says it isn't a problem, because, yeah, Mr. Reid is at Bilderberg Group meetings.
[02:16:43.572 --> 02:16:44.293]  Thanks for the call.
[02:16:44.613 --> 02:16:46.114]  Robert, comments to what she was saying?
[02:16:46.134 --> 02:16:55.719]  Now, as I say, Tony Sutton wrote a very good book on this, and he put it out in hardcover, but there are several good books out on Scottenbaum.
[02:16:57.131 --> 02:17:05.247]  And of course John Kerry and George W. are both skull and bones as George's father and grandfather were skulls.
[02:17:06.460 --> 02:17:08.680]  And again, he funded the Nazis, as usual.
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:09.901]  That same connection.
[02:17:10.101 --> 02:17:10.901]  That's a good question.
[02:17:10.961 --> 02:17:16.582]  How does Arnold Schwarzenegger... They're really grooming this guy and ignoring all the incredible dirt.
[02:17:16.642 --> 02:17:17.762]  No one has as much dirt.
[02:17:18.362 --> 02:17:21.963]  I mean, you know, this incredible taboo stuff.
[02:17:22.063 --> 02:17:23.583]  Nazi love, all this stuff.
[02:17:23.803 --> 02:17:24.843]  But he's okay.
[02:17:25.143 --> 02:17:26.563]  Why do they love Arnold Schwarzenegger?
[02:17:27.043 --> 02:17:27.604]  I don't know.
[02:17:27.624 --> 02:17:35.285]  You know, he met with Warren Buffett and Rothschild over in London a couple weeks before he declared that he was going to run for governor.
[02:17:40.480 --> 02:17:41.080]  Absolutely.
[02:17:41.841 --> 02:17:43.401]  Good comments, Carol.
[02:17:44.181 --> 02:17:49.043]  Let's talk to Wayne in Nebraska.
[02:17:49.063 --> 02:17:49.923]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:17:50.203 --> 02:17:54.384]  Yeah, I'd like to know about this Fortinberry who's running for Congress for Nebraska.
[02:17:55.024 --> 02:17:55.844]  I don't know.
[02:17:56.045 --> 02:17:56.925]  I don't know anything about it.
[02:17:57.405 --> 02:17:57.765]  Okay.
[02:17:58.405 --> 02:18:03.127]  Another question I would have is on the Rifle Association.
[02:18:03.167 --> 02:18:04.547]  They called me up on the phone.
[02:18:05.239 --> 02:18:08.060]  I don't know if this might be getting off your subject, I hope not too much.
[02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:09.361]  Well, it's all interconnected.
[02:18:10.181 --> 02:18:11.082]  It's all interconnected.
[02:18:11.122 --> 02:18:15.104]  I told the lady about the Lady of Peace Act and of course she was in denial.
[02:18:16.346 --> 02:18:25.172]  Anyhow, um... Yeah, the NRA publicly promoting gun legislation, publicly going into court arguing that all guns should be registered.
[02:18:25.212 --> 02:18:26.172]  That was last year.
[02:18:26.192 --> 02:18:27.553]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:18:27.713 --> 02:18:32.416]  But, I mean, Galen, as you've said, it's a WWF stage wrestling match.
[02:18:32.676 --> 02:18:33.897]  They've got to get our guns.
[02:18:34.197 --> 02:18:36.399]  Of course they're going to take over our Second Amendment group.
[02:18:36.439 --> 02:18:37.759]  I mean, that's just common sense.
[02:18:37.799 --> 02:18:38.500]  Can you comment on that?
[02:18:38.660 --> 02:18:46.025]  Yeah, they cannot create the American Union without first outlawing private ownership of guns in the United States.
[02:18:46.085 --> 02:18:49.828]  We're the most armed nation in the world.
[02:18:50.929 --> 02:18:58.614]  And every dictator that's taken over their country has first outlawed private ownership of weapons before they became dictators.
[02:19:00.555 --> 02:19:04.018]  So it's real simple to all the leftists out there that are starting to wake up.
[02:19:04.458 --> 02:19:05.779]  Slaves are disarmed.
[02:19:06.593 --> 02:19:09.555]  Bad men take the guns so they can have their way with you.
[02:19:09.915 --> 02:19:11.556]  Prisoners are disarmed.
[02:19:13.177 --> 02:19:14.498]  Anything else, Wayne?
[02:19:14.698 --> 02:19:15.799]  Well, there's one other thing.
[02:19:16.019 --> 02:19:28.566]  We've had a thing about a compact, a nuclear waste compact here that weren't part of a compact that they were going to put the low-level nuclear waste here in Nebraska.
[02:19:29.667 --> 02:19:33.329]  And now I can see it's gone down to someplace in western Texas.
[02:19:33.409 --> 02:19:34.590]  I saw it in the paper today.
[02:19:35.454 --> 02:19:40.776]  You know, they're trying to charge us, I think, $30 to $50 million, I don't know, for some kind of fines.
[02:19:40.896 --> 02:19:42.516]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:19:43.757 --> 02:19:47.998]  Well, I mean, that goes into the depleted uranium killing the troops, and the government doesn't care.
[02:19:48.278 --> 02:19:49.498]  They see us as cattle.
[02:19:49.878 --> 02:19:51.879]  How people serve these creatures, I'll never know.
[02:19:51.939 --> 02:19:52.499]  Thanks for the call.
[02:19:52.539 --> 02:19:52.879]  Thank you.
[02:19:53.119 --> 02:19:53.419]  You bet.
[02:19:53.459 --> 02:19:56.460]  Will and Brian and Dennis and others, we're going to go to your calls.
[02:19:56.480 --> 02:19:56.960]  Bam, bam, bam.
[02:19:56.980 --> 02:20:00.321]  Because I've got some other news items I want to go over with Robert, Gale, and Ross.
[02:20:00.962 --> 02:20:02.342]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:20:03.551 --> 02:20:07.033]  Robert, I know there's a lot you want to talk about, so we'll get to that when we return.
[02:20:07.453 --> 02:20:09.114]  Everybody, stay with us.
[02:20:09.834 --> 02:20:11.655]  Infowars.com is the website.

[02:22:27.848 --> 02:22:31.450]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[02:22:31.490 --> 02:22:33.072]  I've tried many, many products.
[02:22:33.232 --> 02:22:35.534]  I have never experienced anything like Collagenate.
[02:22:35.974 --> 02:22:39.817]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than 8 weeks.
[02:22:40.237 --> 02:22:40.918]  It truly works.
[02:22:41.314 --> 02:22:42.515]  Collagenate is wonderful.

[02:23:29.690 --> 02:23:34.835]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:35.495 --> 02:23:37.917]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:23:39.459 --> 02:23:47.486]  My friends, if you haven't gotten my two 9-11 films, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, and The Masters of Terror, I don't know what planet you're on.
[02:23:48.167 --> 02:23:55.153]  I mean, they're powerful films that give you the big picture of the history of governments blowing stuff up, sinking ships, bombing buildings,
[02:23:55.902 --> 02:23:58.786]  Remote-controlling jet aircraft to blame it on foreign enemies.
[02:23:59.827 --> 02:24:01.709]  It's all in these two videos.
[02:24:01.789 --> 02:24:05.113]  I've also got Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, and I snuck in there.
[02:24:05.694 --> 02:24:07.095]  Coming up on the anniversary of that.
[02:24:07.416 --> 02:24:09.658]  It'll be the four-year anniversary on the 15th of this month.
[02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:15.165]  You'd be going on again out there with all your Christian conservative leaders and worshipping Satan.
[02:24:15.914 --> 02:24:17.015]  That's ridiculous.
[02:24:17.456 --> 02:24:19.499]  You need to get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:24:19.659 --> 02:24:21.761]  All my films are $25.95 apiece.
[02:24:22.222 --> 02:24:24.705]  All over two hours long.

[02:24:53.629 --> 02:24:58.691]  The full color, 80-plus page, 9-11, The Great Illusion booklets.
[02:24:59.011 --> 02:25:02.832]  We carry Eric Huffman's 9-11, The Great Deception.
[02:25:03.988 --> 02:25:06.110]  You need to get that video.
[02:25:06.150 --> 02:25:08.731]  We have his book, 9-11 Painful Questions.
[02:25:09.412 --> 02:25:12.934]  You need to have these books and videos.
[02:25:12.994 --> 02:25:15.016]  You need to show them to people.
[02:25:15.076 --> 02:25:18.118]  You're allowed to make copies of my videos, not of the others that I carry.
[02:25:18.138 --> 02:25:20.019]  Because obviously they're not mine to do that.
[02:25:20.535 --> 02:25:23.739]  We have Jews, the Preservation of Farms, Ownerships, new incredible film.
[02:25:24.500 --> 02:25:28.725]  What Robert was just talking about, governments taking guns and then killing the people.
[02:25:29.727 --> 02:25:31.469]  180 million killed last century alone.
[02:25:31.809 --> 02:25:32.911]  Innocents betrayed.
[02:25:33.271 --> 02:25:34.392]  It comes with three books.
[02:25:35.093 --> 02:25:36.295]  And it's $29.95, the video and the books.
[02:25:38.890 --> 02:25:44.273]  So that's on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order a VR Safe Secure Shopping Cart.

[02:26:16.196 --> 02:26:17.478]  They're waking people up.
[02:26:17.759 --> 02:26:20.102]  So as Galen Ross said, we've got to get
[02:26:21.044 --> 02:26:22.666]  Five percent of people out there active.
[02:26:22.686 --> 02:26:23.907]  We've already reached that number.
[02:26:23.947 --> 02:26:25.268]  We've got to push it over the edge.
[02:26:25.668 --> 02:26:31.854]  Robert Galen Ross, before we go to Will and Brian and Dennis and Regina and John, and that'll be it for calls, folks.
[02:26:31.894 --> 02:26:33.856]  We've got about 25 minutes left here.
[02:26:33.996 --> 02:26:34.617]  24 minutes left here.
[02:26:34.897 --> 02:26:38.360]  Before we do that, Robert Galen Ross, you've got a new video out.
[02:26:38.400 --> 02:26:39.702]  You've got some powerful books.
[02:26:39.742 --> 02:26:41.003]  How do folks check that out?
[02:26:41.844 --> 02:26:43.145]  They can go to my website.
[02:26:43.205 --> 02:26:46.088]  It's www.number4.com.
[02:26:46.975 --> 02:26:49.017]  RIE.com.

[02:26:51.479 --> 02:26:56.903]  Or they can call my 800 number, which is 410-5571.
[02:26:57.603 --> 02:26:59.344]  But a comment about... Well, hold on.
[02:26:59.525 --> 02:26:59.805]  Hold on.
[02:26:59.845 --> 02:27:01.866]  Give the website out again and the toll-free number.
[02:27:02.186 --> 02:27:02.407]  All right.
[02:27:02.447 --> 02:27:08.471]  The website is www.4rie.com.
[02:27:08.511 --> 02:27:11.213]  That's the number for RIE.com.
[02:27:11.273 --> 02:27:13.075]  And the toll-free number is 800-410-5571.
[02:27:19.236 --> 02:27:21.897]  Hey, Robert, let me add a point here, and I hope folks take advantage of that.
[02:27:21.937 --> 02:27:23.478]  We'll talk about some of the titles in a minute.
[02:27:24.719 --> 02:27:30.643]  You know, I found out that, and this isn't tootin' our horn, folks, it's just the facts, okay?
[02:27:30.723 --> 02:27:35.826]  I'm not bragging, it's actually pretty scary, and it makes me know what type of responsibility I have.
[02:27:36.407 --> 02:27:41.450]  I found out that my work, Robert Galen Ross's work, Tex Marr's work, and a few other people's,
[02:27:42.350 --> 02:27:54.054]  Uh, is watched by the Muslim governments, is watched by the German government, is big in the Japanese government, and now over the last few months I've actually been contacted by people, and I can't even get into names here.
[02:27:54.074 --> 02:27:57.856]  Uh, are you getting that same thing, Robert, because your name has come up?
[02:27:58.116 --> 02:28:08.560]  Yeah, you and I just, uh, in fact appeared on the British, uh, uh, video that's coming out, and then I've also been contacted by the, uh, Japanese, and, uh, that'll be coming up soon.
[02:28:09.170 --> 02:28:11.232]  Yeah, and I've forgotten to call them for the last week.
[02:28:11.272 --> 02:28:12.413]  I need to call and tell them I am.
[02:28:12.673 --> 02:28:19.839]  But I mean, people in foreign governments are sitting around in boardrooms watching my films, and your name has come up.
[02:28:20.019 --> 02:28:20.900]  Were you aware of that?
[02:28:23.222 --> 02:28:23.862]  I'm amazed.
[02:28:24.963 --> 02:28:31.629]  The hits on my website all of a sudden will peak at certain times, and I don't know what's going on, but someone's bringing it up.
[02:28:32.449 --> 02:28:35.372]  And I'm also working on my third book, which will be titled
[02:28:36.212 --> 02:28:40.813]  The elite don't dare let us tell the people, and that's scheduled for completion sometime in September.
[02:28:41.634 --> 02:28:49.556]  Well, I mean, we're just common, average people that understand history and have been following the globalists like other people follow football so we know all about it.
[02:28:50.016 --> 02:28:54.958]  It scares me how many people in mid-level positions of government don't even know what's going on, Robert.
[02:28:55.338 --> 02:29:05.061]  Yeah, and I think you and I and Tex and a few others are blessed with an abnormal amount of perception, and I don't
[02:29:06.431 --> 02:29:12.393]  I don't claim to be intelligent, but I have some extra perception like you do.
[02:29:13.113 --> 02:29:17.395]  We're able to see things that are going on that other people just don't recognize.
[02:29:18.515 --> 02:29:24.357]  Well, I think if people, you know, the Bible says if you ask God for discernment, many times you'll get it.
[02:29:24.937 --> 02:29:26.398]  I pray for discernment every day.
[02:29:27.478 --> 02:29:29.479]  You were going to make a point, though, before we go to these calls.
[02:29:29.519 --> 02:29:30.179]  What was that point?
[02:29:31.773 --> 02:29:45.222]  I was going to say that I've often talked to people about the Bohemian Grove and described it, and they looked at me like I'm stupid, and when I show them your video, their mouth drops.
[02:29:45.902 --> 02:29:47.884]  You can't deny it once you see your video.
[02:29:49.985 --> 02:29:51.026]  You can't create that.
[02:29:51.066 --> 02:29:52.747]  That's not a play.
[02:29:53.067 --> 02:29:57.630]  It's a real Moloch thing.
[02:29:58.291 --> 02:30:02.817]  It's scary to see it but you can't really get anyone to believe it until they see your video.
[02:30:18.542 --> 02:30:25.463]  And I don't know that he goes to the Grove, I haven't seen that, but many other Christian leaders go to this and then they'll chastise me.
[02:30:25.523 --> 02:30:34.185]  I've had national Christian shows attack me and say I'm a liar, how dare I say Bohemian Grove is bad, how dare I say Bush is part of Skull and Bones.
[02:30:34.525 --> 02:30:38.626]  How can they keep denying this when it's out in the open and admitted, Robert?
[02:30:39.306 --> 02:30:44.627]  There's so many people out there that don't want to face up to the truth because
[02:30:45.279 --> 02:30:50.221]  Well, you know, four years ago we snuck into Bohemian Grove and they admit we snuck in.
[02:30:50.421 --> 02:30:51.681]  It's just been in the newspaper.
[02:30:51.701 --> 02:30:53.462]  They say, yeah, Mr. Jones did this.
[02:31:03.611 --> 02:31:05.532]  Still, people are in denial about it.
[02:31:05.592 --> 02:31:11.715]  I mean, imagine if you and I were in our backyard doing this ritual, our neighbors would call the police on us.
[02:31:11.835 --> 02:31:12.315]  That's right.
[02:31:12.475 --> 02:31:14.276]  But our leaders do it, and it's normal.
[02:31:14.496 --> 02:31:16.097]  And it's world leaders, not just U.S.
[02:31:16.117 --> 02:31:16.457]  leaders.
[02:31:16.497 --> 02:31:19.238]  Well, that's right.
[02:31:20.639 --> 02:31:24.220]  Leaders around the world attend the Bohemian Grove.
[02:31:24.360 --> 02:31:26.781]  Let's take calls quickly, folks, because I've got to get to everybody.
[02:31:26.841 --> 02:31:28.242]  Will in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[02:31:28.996 --> 02:31:29.776]  Hi, Alex.
[02:31:29.796 --> 02:31:31.557]  First, I wanted to say I'm a huge fan of yours.
[02:31:31.677 --> 02:31:33.598]  I watch all your videos, show them to my friends.
[02:31:33.658 --> 02:31:34.458]  We all love you.
[02:31:34.478 --> 02:31:35.118]  We think you're great.
[02:31:35.498 --> 02:31:35.878]  Thank you.
[02:31:37.519 --> 02:31:39.180]  I had a question about Richard Gephardt.
[02:31:39.200 --> 02:31:41.520]  We know Bush and Kerry, both skull and bones.
[02:31:41.820 --> 02:31:43.401]  Like you say, two sides of the same coin.
[02:31:44.121 --> 02:31:48.783]  Do you think Gephardt is any different, or do you have any opinions on Richard Gephardt, know anything about him, his background?
[02:31:48.803 --> 02:31:57.966]  He's really just a union man, and pretty high level, and puts on a lot of rhetoric that's good about trade, but he never does anything about it.
[02:31:58.266 --> 02:32:00.127]  Robert Galen Ross?
[02:32:00.987 --> 02:32:07.430]  To my knowledge, and I've got just tons of records, he's not a member of any of the secret groups.
[02:32:07.450 --> 02:32:13.452]  So that means he probably never reached very high within any organization.
[02:32:14.082 --> 02:32:16.724]  Yeah.
[02:32:16.764 --> 02:32:17.765]  Can I ask one more question?
[02:32:17.785 --> 02:32:18.025]  Sure.
[02:32:18.866 --> 02:32:23.249]  I saw the clip of Jeremy Glick on O'Reilly, and I heard your response on the show.
[02:32:23.289 --> 02:32:25.771]  You had Jeremy Glick, remember that, when O'Reilly flipped out on him?
[02:32:25.992 --> 02:32:26.292]  Yes.
[02:32:27.233 --> 02:32:30.735]  You made a comment about if you had O'Reilly on your show, you'd tear him to pieces.
[02:32:30.836 --> 02:32:33.077]  Would you ever consider getting Bill O'Reilly on your show?
[02:32:33.338 --> 02:32:35.659]  I've tried, and we've tried to get on his broadcast.
[02:32:35.940 --> 02:32:36.620]  Oh, really?
[02:32:36.780 --> 02:32:37.361]  He wouldn't come on?
[02:32:38.642 --> 02:32:38.882]  No.
[02:32:39.382 --> 02:32:41.124]  I think O'Reilly would be afraid of you.
[02:32:43.004 --> 02:32:47.767]  Well, he's an arrogant creature that's fooled a lot of good people.
[02:32:47.807 --> 02:32:48.648]  Thanks for the call, Will.
[02:32:49.408 --> 02:32:50.509]  Brian in Oregon.
[02:32:50.549 --> 02:32:51.410]  Brian, you're on the air.
[02:32:51.450 --> 02:32:51.850]  Go ahead.
[02:32:54.672 --> 02:32:54.992]  Okay.
[02:32:55.412 --> 02:32:55.712]  Hello?
[02:32:56.153 --> 02:32:57.073]  Yes, Brian, go ahead.
[02:32:57.414 --> 02:33:05.859]  Yeah, I'm a PrismPlanet.tv member, and you had that online poll, and David Icke got about 50% out of all 12.
[02:33:06.039 --> 02:33:09.581]  I was wondering how that is coming along, if you're going to get him on the show.
[02:33:09.642 --> 02:33:11.623]  We are lining up David Icke for the broadcast.
[02:33:12.276 --> 02:33:12.876]  Oh, great.
[02:33:13.176 --> 02:33:16.757]  He uncovers great stuff, whether you disagree with him or not or whatever.
[02:33:16.777 --> 02:33:18.458]  No, we're going to be having him on for a bit.
[02:33:19.458 --> 02:33:20.898]  And what about Brian Desborough?
[02:33:20.998 --> 02:33:21.679]  You ever heard of him?
[02:33:22.079 --> 02:33:23.239]  Yes, we're going to try to get him on.
[02:33:23.799 --> 02:33:24.599]  Oh, that would be great.
[02:33:25.020 --> 02:33:25.580]  Thank you so much.
[02:33:25.920 --> 02:33:26.880]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[02:33:27.640 --> 02:33:30.581]  What do you think of David Icke's stuff, Robert Gaylen Ross?
[02:33:31.161 --> 02:33:40.744]  I liked everything that David did up until he did the piece on the reptilian concept.
[02:33:41.511 --> 02:33:43.694]  And I don't say that he's wrong.
[02:33:43.794 --> 02:33:48.361]  I just don't know enough about it to say he's right or wrong.
[02:33:48.461 --> 02:33:49.423]  Well, that's the problem.
[02:33:49.463 --> 02:33:54.610]  We have trouble getting people to admit public groups that are making world government announcements.
[02:33:56.363 --> 02:34:00.326]  I have no evidence that there's a secret breed of reptilian vampires running things.
[02:34:00.826 --> 02:34:04.429]  But everything else he says is very well documented, and he's very articulate.
[02:34:04.749 --> 02:34:06.070]  The whole thing's very interesting.
[02:34:06.090 --> 02:34:14.877]  Yeah, I just don't have the time to follow the reptilian concept, and so I can't say it's right or wrong.
[02:34:14.897 --> 02:34:21.061]  Yeah, it's very sensational, but I could sell 100,000 books if I was writing about it, but I'm not going to do it.
[02:34:21.681 --> 02:34:23.042]  Let's go ahead and talk to...
[02:34:24.569 --> 02:34:31.472]  Next up here, let's go ahead and talk to Dennis in Michigan.
[02:34:31.492 --> 02:34:32.092]  You're on the air.
[02:34:32.112 --> 02:34:32.552]  Go ahead.
[02:34:32.852 --> 02:34:33.292]  Yes, sir.
[02:34:33.353 --> 02:34:35.213]  Greetings, my friends, and thank you very much.
[02:34:35.253 --> 02:34:36.774]  I have three things very quickly.
[02:34:37.934 --> 02:34:44.797]  April 14th, which was the day that Lincoln was shot, I called the John Birch Society about the
[02:34:45.379 --> 02:34:49.581]  KLA007 being shot down because Larry McDonald is still missing.
[02:34:49.761 --> 02:34:51.162]  Yeah, Congressman McDonald, yeah.
[02:34:51.382 --> 02:34:51.602]  Right.
[02:34:51.802 --> 02:34:59.026]  And they did send me some information the day after George Bush came to Niles, Michigan, which is 12 miles from me.
[02:34:59.907 --> 02:35:04.189]  And on his morning, he went to the high school at 1 p.m.
[02:35:04.209 --> 02:35:08.271]  in the afternoon and had an all-day fire burning the McDonald's restaurant.
[02:35:09.131 --> 02:35:11.833]  Niles is a community of about 15,000 people.
[02:35:12.613 --> 02:35:14.334]  You think that was some type of Illuminati
[02:35:15.054 --> 02:35:15.714]  Programming.
[02:35:16.295 --> 02:35:19.137]  Well, they always want to bluff you.
[02:35:20.157 --> 02:35:22.398]  That's the kind of stuff I don't touch because you can't prove it.
[02:35:22.739 --> 02:35:32.545]  What I can say is that on the one year anniversary of 9-11, the New York Lottery came up 9-11, and the Chicago Mercantile came up 9-11 with a bunch of zeros behind it, which is like 1 out of 14 billion.
[02:35:32.925 --> 02:35:35.987]  So they are into numerology, they are into doing stuff in plain view.
[02:35:36.187 --> 02:35:38.068]  Let me get a comment from Robert Galen Ross on that.
[02:35:38.108 --> 02:35:38.968]  Thanks for the call, Dennis.
[02:35:39.389 --> 02:35:40.329]  Robert, comments on that?
[02:35:41.915 --> 02:35:53.937]  I'm not into numerology but I've read a lot of information on it and that's just an area I don't have much expertise in.
[02:35:55.871 --> 02:35:56.451]  Absolutely.
[02:35:56.651 --> 02:35:57.932]  Let's go ahead and talk.
[02:35:57.952 --> 02:35:59.253]  We're going to these calls quick, folks.
[02:35:59.413 --> 02:36:01.114]  Regina in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[02:36:01.134 --> 02:36:02.374]  Hi, Alex.
[02:36:02.435 --> 02:36:18.543]  Just wanted to tell you that Will from Pennsylvania, maybe he could help and see if Gephardt will help us support Sanders-Paul Amendment to the Commerce Justice State Appropriations, dealing with the funding, denying funding for Section 215 of the Patriot Act.
[02:36:19.165 --> 02:36:20.506]  Let's see where these guys are on.
[02:36:20.526 --> 02:36:21.026]  That's right.
[02:36:21.086 --> 02:36:22.807]  That's a vote in the House.
[02:36:23.287 --> 02:36:25.528]  Today is what I understand.
[02:36:25.608 --> 02:36:26.668]  And here's some of the other news.
[02:36:26.868 --> 02:36:28.429]  Lay surrenders to authorities.
[02:36:28.509 --> 02:36:35.292]  Ex-Enron CEO turns himself in after being indicted for taking part in a massive accounting fraud because they caught him on tape.
[02:36:36.321 --> 02:36:38.583]  And then I have the other article about the Patriot Act.
[02:36:38.623 --> 02:36:40.525]  Patriot Act foes force House vote.
[02:36:41.066 --> 02:36:52.156]  AP lawmakers who say portions of the USA Patriot Act, the whole thing went too far, are taking aim at the provision that made it easier for investigators to learn what people are reading despite a veto threat from the White House.
[02:36:52.536 --> 02:36:57.821]  The House planned to vote Thursday on a proposed Representative Bernard Sanders of Vermont
[02:36:58.442 --> 02:37:03.924]  It would prevent the government from using the Patriot Act to demand records of bookstores and libraries.
[02:37:04.765 --> 02:37:06.726]  Let me get a comment from Galen Ross on that.
[02:37:07.206 --> 02:37:17.710]  Yeah, we really don't know yet what's coming out in the Patriot Act 2, but it's going to be probably twice as tight and restrictive as Patriot Act 1.
[02:37:17.910 --> 02:37:21.712]  Well, I call it 2.5 because part of it passed in the intelligence package December 13th.
[02:37:22.632 --> 02:37:26.975]  Last year, the same day they made the Saddam announcements and nobody really heard about it.
[02:37:27.355 --> 02:37:28.956]  And I've seen versions of the new one.
[02:37:28.976 --> 02:37:30.257]  They've got like three different versions.
[02:37:30.377 --> 02:37:32.918]  And it is, it is, it is unbelievable.
[02:37:33.218 --> 02:37:36.680]  Well, there may be parts of it that are classified.
[02:37:36.760 --> 02:37:38.121]  Most of it is classified, yeah.
[02:37:39.962 --> 02:37:41.263]  Okay, Regina, thanks for the call.
[02:37:41.303 --> 02:37:41.823]  Good point.
[02:37:42.244 --> 02:37:43.905]  John in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[02:37:43.945 --> 02:37:44.265]  Go ahead.
[02:37:45.014 --> 02:37:45.875]  Yes, good afternoon.
[02:37:46.035 --> 02:37:46.375]  You too.
[02:37:46.756 --> 02:37:53.402]  Look, our masters have developed in us a propaganda, a phobia.
[02:37:53.562 --> 02:37:54.583]  It's a gun phobia.
[02:37:55.183 --> 02:37:58.627]  And it exactly parallels the tobacco phobia.
[02:37:58.987 --> 02:38:07.795]  Now, regardless of health issues, if they can manipulate our minds like that, we no longer belong to the civilized, sane world.
[02:38:07.815 --> 02:38:11.078]  Do you agree that it is a phobia that they have developed?
[02:38:11.570 --> 02:38:20.013]  Well, they used mind control in the form of subliminal suggestions and this sort of thing, and that's been going on for years.
[02:38:21.053 --> 02:38:28.376]  I mean, folks, when you take an RTF course at a major university, there's a whole... I mean, if you get a degree in it, you spend like a semester on it.
[02:38:29.153 --> 02:38:34.357]  I mean, it's admitted, but you tell the average dumbbell who's under it that they're under it, and then they'll laugh at you.
[02:38:34.877 --> 02:38:41.903]  I mean, I've got an article here where almost half of Americans in 2002 didn't read a book.
[02:38:43.224 --> 02:38:46.146]  Just look what they have done to us on the tobacco issue.
[02:38:46.827 --> 02:38:49.389]  It proves they can do anything they want to to us.
[02:38:51.750 --> 02:38:54.172]  Yeah, they can take over any industry they want.
[02:38:54.392 --> 02:38:55.413]  Thanks for the call, John.
[02:38:56.174 --> 02:38:57.315]  Rick in Reno, Nevada.
[02:38:57.375 --> 02:38:58.015]  Rick, go ahead.
[02:38:58.035 --> 02:38:58.916]  Yes, gentlemen.
[02:38:59.953 --> 02:39:11.600]  I'm calling to argue the point that how can the average Joe, someone like myself, distinguish the disinformation from the real McCoy?
[02:39:11.800 --> 02:39:19.064]  For instance, so-called former CIA operatives Mark Phillips or John Stockton or Philip Agee.
[02:39:20.144 --> 02:39:24.427]  How do we know that you, sir, are not still working for the NSA?
[02:39:25.766 --> 02:39:29.893]  I used to work for the NSA for five years, but I don't anymore.
[02:39:35.919 --> 02:39:47.731]  We're not telling you some foggy story about mind control slaves in a cave and, you know, Dick Cheney on horseback hunting people or, you know, space aliens or whatever, and I don't even know some of the names you're mentioning.
[02:39:48.512 --> 02:39:55.779]  We focus in on, hey, here's the New York Times admitting the Moldeberg Group basically selected John Edwards.
[02:39:56.520 --> 02:39:57.420]  We can get involved.
[02:39:57.460 --> 02:39:58.361]  We can fight back.
[02:39:58.441 --> 02:39:59.923]  We can have an effect.
[02:40:00.678 --> 02:40:02.760]  And, uh, you know, you judge a tree by its fruits.
[02:40:02.840 --> 02:40:07.925]  Robert Galen Ross has been informing people, getting folks involved, using source documents.
[02:40:08.306 --> 02:40:13.651]  You know, when I say Section 213 of the Patriot Act allows for secret warrantless searches of your house or business,
[02:40:14.663 --> 02:40:18.725]  You can go read the subsection, sir, and it's up to you to decide what you want to do about it.
[02:40:18.966 --> 02:40:19.826]  I understand what you're saying.
[02:40:20.126 --> 02:40:27.030]  I mean, Robert Gaylon Ross is a great guy, and he's telling you you should be a leader, because you know you're a good person, sir.
[02:40:27.050 --> 02:40:28.551]  At least you probably are.
[02:40:29.171 --> 02:40:31.433]  And so you should go out and get involved, Rick.
[02:40:31.473 --> 02:40:32.293]  You should be a leader.
[02:40:32.593 --> 02:40:33.654]  What I'm saying is this.
[02:40:33.894 --> 02:40:36.576]  It's very difficult to sort out the wheat from the chaff.
[02:40:37.535 --> 02:40:52.968]  I've seen some material on the internet that appears to be trying to drive a wedge between you and Mike Rupert, and I know that this is false information, but I had to do a lot of hunting to get to the bottom of it and determine that it was not.
[02:40:52.988 --> 02:40:55.370]  See, I've never even responded to any of that.
[02:40:55.651 --> 02:40:56.992]  I'm not worried about that.
[02:40:57.272 --> 02:40:58.573]  It's not about Alex Jones.
[02:40:58.633 --> 02:40:59.734]  It's not about anybody else.
[02:41:00.295 --> 02:41:02.997]  I just covered the news, sir, and tried to get you involved.
[02:41:03.687 --> 02:41:04.347]  I'm getting involved.
[02:41:04.427 --> 02:41:06.168]  Okay, and I've driven no wedges.
[02:41:06.648 --> 02:41:07.429]  I get attacked.
[02:41:07.569 --> 02:41:08.449]  I don't attack back.
[02:41:09.109 --> 02:41:09.830]  Gotcha.
[02:41:09.870 --> 02:41:12.211]  Robert, I mean, have you ever seen me attack anybody back?
[02:41:12.311 --> 02:41:14.672]  No, not at all, except when you were a voter.
[02:41:15.512 --> 02:41:16.092]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:41:16.572 --> 02:41:18.793]  You know, I keep my eyes focused, folks.
[02:41:19.453 --> 02:41:24.195]  Instead, most of the patriot community spends their time, you know, trying to climb to the top with some heat.
[02:41:24.736 --> 02:41:25.636]  And I'm not into that.
[02:41:25.656 --> 02:41:26.997]  I just keep moving forward.
[02:41:28.647 --> 02:41:32.992]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:41:33.172 --> 02:41:37.516]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:41:40.179 --> 02:41:41.460]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:41:58.888 --> 02:42:09.431]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:42:09.631 --> 02:42:15.012]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:42:15.513 --> 02:42:18.173]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:42:18.293 --> 02:42:18.834]  Recall it's all free.
[02:42:18.854 --> 02:42:18.914]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:42:18.934 --> 02:42:19.274]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:42:19.294 --> 02:42:20.574]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:42:27.976 --> 02:42:30.999]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:42:31.299 --> 02:42:36.243]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:42:36.484 --> 02:42:40.847]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:42:41.148 --> 02:42:50.056]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:42:50.276 --> 02:42:53.899]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:42:54.159 --> 02:42:59.200]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:42:59.500 --> 02:43:06.222]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:43:06.702 --> 02:43:07.362]  What about you?
[02:43:08.022 --> 02:43:12.143]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[02:43:12.163 --> 02:43:13.043]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.

[02:43:25.226 --> 02:43:34.969]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:43:35.209 --> 02:43:37.470]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:43:37.650 --> 02:43:43.992]  We provide outstanding products like ECAC, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:43:44.332 --> 02:43:44.992]  We're good to go!
[02:44:13.869 --> 02:44:16.971]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:44:17.111 --> 02:44:23.095]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:44:29.119 --> 02:44:41.428]  I'm going to have to have Robert Gamble-Ross back on the show here very soon.
[02:44:42.421 --> 02:44:44.804]  We'll try to talk to Brooke and Pat here in a second.
[02:44:46.166 --> 02:44:48.368]  Just a few of the news items I wanted to throw out here.
[02:44:48.468 --> 02:44:53.014]  Police began random bus searches, and this is going on all over the country.
[02:44:53.849 --> 02:44:58.032]  It says airline passengers go through it, and now some of the bus passengers.
[02:44:58.112 --> 02:44:59.233]  Long before 9-11, folks.
[02:44:59.253 --> 02:45:03.256]  They were getting ready for this, so this will be part of the new Papers, Please system nationwide.
[02:45:03.856 --> 02:45:05.237]  Michael Moore has done something good.
[02:45:05.277 --> 02:45:06.418]  I have the Scottish Herald here.
[02:45:06.458 --> 02:45:13.623]  We did an interview saying he thinks it's fine if people pirate his film on the internet and download it for free and get it out to people.
[02:45:14.223 --> 02:45:16.105]  And I say the same thing about my videos.
[02:45:16.145 --> 02:45:17.926]  Again, I don't support Michael Moore on many levels.
[02:45:18.576 --> 02:45:21.298]  But at this level, I do, and that is a great thing.
[02:45:21.818 --> 02:45:25.880]  Meanwhile, the FCC wants radio and TV to keep its tapes of shows.
[02:45:25.920 --> 02:45:34.165]  They want every radio and TV show to keep tapes of their show, bearing witness against themselves, guilty until proven innocent.
[02:45:34.566 --> 02:45:38.568]  Total violation of the Fifth Amendment, and this is only a regulatory agency.
[02:45:38.848 --> 02:45:40.369]  That's a very dangerous trend.
[02:45:41.530 --> 02:45:46.072]  So, Robert Galen Ross, anything else you want to add before we take two final calls?
[02:45:46.473 --> 02:45:46.993]  No, go ahead.
[02:45:48.027 --> 02:45:51.349]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brooke in Rhode Island.
[02:45:51.429 --> 02:45:51.929]  Go ahead.
[02:45:52.509 --> 02:45:53.130]  Yes, Alex.
[02:45:53.270 --> 02:45:55.371]  I saw your cremation at care video.
[02:45:55.971 --> 02:45:59.513]  It's staggering and stunning, and I recommend it to all your listeners.
[02:45:59.833 --> 02:46:00.733]  That's number one.
[02:46:01.274 --> 02:46:04.435]  Number two is I have a comment and a question.
[02:46:04.795 --> 02:46:05.095]  OK.
[02:46:05.556 --> 02:46:12.079]  Comment is, even if you're on the right track, you'll still get run over if you just sit there.
[02:46:14.140 --> 02:46:15.581]  The question is, in 1832,
[02:46:16.889 --> 02:46:19.890]  There was an anti-Masonic convention in Philadelphia.
[02:46:20.151 --> 02:46:22.632]  Yeah, so they set up Skull and Bones to counter it in 1932.
[02:46:22.732 --> 02:46:24.393]  Is that what it was?
[02:46:24.413 --> 02:46:32.937]  Because I thought John Adams was involved in all this anti-Masonic stuff, and I thought it was a great idea to have another anti-Masonic convention and an anti-Masonic party.
[02:46:32.957 --> 02:46:33.497]  No, he was.
[02:46:33.857 --> 02:46:38.099]  Skull and Bones members told MSNBC that they set Skull and Bones up to counter that.
[02:46:38.439 --> 02:46:39.160]  Robert, comments?
[02:46:40.700 --> 02:46:41.661]  You're right, Alex.
[02:46:42.101 --> 02:46:43.142]  That's all I have to say about it.
[02:46:45.082 --> 02:46:45.643]  Anything else?
[02:46:47.043 --> 02:47:03.563]  Okay, the last thing is for Mr. Ross, in the Reagan funeral, the cross in the floor of the Washington National Cathedral, inlaid in marble at hundreds of thousands of dollars a cost when the cathedral was built, is the same cross.
[02:47:03.959 --> 02:47:10.621]  That Hitler and the royal families of Europe wear in Ronald Reagan's coffin was resting on that cross.
[02:47:10.661 --> 02:47:11.461]  Yeah, I saw that.
[02:47:11.481 --> 02:47:14.162]  It was the Templar's Cross.
[02:47:14.502 --> 02:47:20.324]  Yes, and that cross was removed in any photograph in Newsweek and Time Magazine.
[02:47:20.444 --> 02:47:21.664]  It was totally edited out.
[02:47:21.824 --> 02:47:24.485]  I only saw it in the New York Daily News.
[02:47:24.585 --> 02:47:26.826]  There's a lot of secret symbolism, thanks for the call.
[02:47:27.746 --> 02:47:29.207]  Let's talk to Pat in Colorado.
[02:47:29.247 --> 02:47:30.107]  Last caller, go ahead.
[02:47:31.224 --> 02:47:32.845]  I'm going to make a comment and then hang up.
[02:47:33.226 --> 02:47:39.010]  With all due respect, the New World Order will happen because it is the seven years of tribulation the Bible speaks of.
[02:47:39.810 --> 02:47:42.112]  Satan is the prince and power of the air until
[02:47:42.842 --> 02:47:43.483]  I'm not laying down.
[02:47:43.543 --> 02:47:44.384]  I'm not laying down.
[02:47:44.464 --> 02:47:46.005]  I'm just saying it's going to happen.
[02:48:01.101 --> 02:48:04.944]  But ma'am, in 1776 they thought it was the Antichrist that shouldn't fight.
[02:48:04.984 --> 02:48:07.205]  They thought it was the end of the world under Hitler.
[02:48:07.646 --> 02:48:14.190]  We have a job to fight evil, and we can be reprieved as a nation and world if we seek God's face and repent of our evil ways.
[02:48:14.250 --> 02:48:15.011]  Robert, comments?
[02:48:15.111 --> 02:48:21.895]  Yeah, well, there's nowhere in the Bible does it say when end times will come, so it may be a thousand years from now.
[02:48:22.016 --> 02:48:24.878]  But it is the seven years of tribulation, and it will happen.
[02:48:25.418 --> 02:48:27.920]  Well, but if we don't know that this is the proper time.
[02:48:27.940 --> 02:48:29.621]  In the end days, really, we are.
[02:48:30.444 --> 02:48:34.226]  Well, all I know is I'm not saying you, but with most so-called Christians, it's a giant cop-out.
[02:48:35.187 --> 02:48:39.089]  And the same Christians that say some of that love George Bush and think Bohemian Grove is good.
[02:48:39.929 --> 02:48:45.492]  And I know you don't think that, but I'm just talking about, you know, well, Mr. Reed at the Bilderberg meeting.
[02:48:47.053 --> 02:48:47.674]  Thanks for the call.
[02:48:47.714 --> 02:48:48.554]  I appreciate it.
[02:48:48.574 --> 02:48:50.735]  Robert Galen Ross, your website one more time.
[02:48:51.155 --> 02:48:52.476]  It's www.4rie.com.
[02:48:52.576 --> 02:48:53.497]  And your phone number?
[02:49:00.471 --> 02:49:01.432]  410-5571.
[02:49:02.253 --> 02:49:05.436]  I want to get you back on soon.
[02:49:05.456 --> 02:49:06.717]  It's been a pleasure, Alex.
[02:49:07.057 --> 02:49:07.458]  Thank you.
[02:49:07.478 --> 02:49:12.543]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:49:12.843 --> 02:49:15.065]  Now get out there and take on the new world order!
