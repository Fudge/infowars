[00:00:05.675 --> 00:00:06.315]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.976 --> 00:00:08.036]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.736 --> 00:00:09.837]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.497 --> 00:00:11.317]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.077 --> 00:00:12.978]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:17.440]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.901]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:34.093]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:35.995]  It is Monday.
[00:00:37.916 --> 00:00:42.360]  Already the 22nd day of November 2004.
[00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:45.242]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:45.263 --> 00:00:47.905]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:47.945 --> 00:00:49.726]  We're going to have wide open phones.
[00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:54.710]  Whatever issues or topics or questions or comments you have, you're absolutely welcome.
[00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:56.592]  I'll be honored to take your calls.
[00:00:57.412 --> 00:00:58.972]  I'm honored and blessed to be your host.
[00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:00.213]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[00:01:00.353 --> 00:01:08.474]  Infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, prisonplanet.tv, infowars.net, and now arnoldexposed.com.
[00:01:10.295 --> 00:01:13.336]  I'm not going to get into any detail on Arnold into the next hour.
[00:01:13.356 --> 00:01:14.936]  I don't want to spend all day on this.
[00:01:14.956 --> 00:01:23.938]  You know I've launched the national movement to counter his movement to butcher Article 2, Clause 5 of the Constitution, but I've stumbled into something big.
[00:01:26.235 --> 00:01:32.600]  The evidence of him running for president is even worse than I thought, and now I've done even more back-breaking research.
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:43.628]  Four hours last night, and the confirmed things I've now discovered are even worse than what I first knew.
[00:01:43.748 --> 00:01:47.030]  I mean, this country's in trouble.
[00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:53.415]  And then I did scores of interviews in California over the weekend on talk radio.
[00:01:55.356 --> 00:02:07.264]  On one broadcast, the host, the biggest in Los Angeles, I talked about how Kurt Voltheim hunted down American soldiers and others, and how Arnold loves him, and I said, you know, killing U.S.
[00:02:07.284 --> 00:02:09.866]  troops, and they said, they started laughing, I said, is that funny?
[00:02:09.886 --> 00:02:11.007]  They go, yeah, I think it's great.
[00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:12.267]  I said, you think it's great?
[00:02:12.287 --> 00:02:12.908]  They said, yeah.
[00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:15.209]  They won't get in trouble.
[00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.211]  Anybody else would.
[00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:23.495]  Every show, even mild-mannered broadcast, I talk calmly, I go over the information,
[00:02:24.304 --> 00:02:25.244]  I am screamed at.
[00:02:25.384 --> 00:02:26.265]  I am called a kook.
[00:02:26.385 --> 00:02:27.265]  I am called evil.
[00:02:29.606 --> 00:02:34.748]  One show on KFI I did Saturday night for an hour was excellent.
[00:02:35.068 --> 00:02:37.649]  And let me go over the facts so the host was aware of what I was saying.
[00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.690]  Everything I was claiming was meticulously posted at ArnoldExposed.com.
[00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:50.073]  But the fact is that people want to be with the winner.
[00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:55.250]  They'd eat down or afraid, and they think if you go with the flow, you go with the system, you'll be rewarded.
[00:02:56.251 --> 00:02:59.231]  And now it has manifested itself with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:03:03.493 --> 00:03:05.293]  I'll just have to spend time on the next hour.
[00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:07.574]  It's been an epiphany for me.
[00:03:08.254 --> 00:03:15.156]  It's opened up my understanding into so many other things that I already had glimpses of inside the New World Order, but so much more.
[00:03:16.937 --> 00:03:20.458]  And I know that I'm right to be focusing a lot on Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:22.439]  I mean, I told you before he ran for governor, he would.
[00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:23.960]  I talked about him running for president.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.080]  Now, even the L.A.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.643]  Times, the Associated Press admit that, yeah, he's probably going to run for president, and that's what all these trips around the world are.
[00:03:33.504 --> 00:03:35.845]  What does it mean for America to have a foreign president?
[00:03:36.425 --> 00:03:37.686]  From Austria, of all places.
[00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:43.208]  Why does the establishment want Arnold Schwarzenegger?
[00:03:43.468 --> 00:03:45.829]  Those questions answered in the next hour.
[00:03:46.952 --> 00:03:51.717]  Coming up in this hour, your calls, and of course, Bush renewed open borders drive yesterday.
[00:03:51.737 --> 00:03:55.141]  Lawmakers say intelligence bill not dead.
[00:03:55.161 --> 00:04:03.030]  They're going to go ahead and bring it back up, because they couldn't get their national ID card through, so they'll bring it back up around Christmas, as they always do.
[00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:07.235]  Just like they gave you the income tax, the Federal Reserve, all of that's done during the holidays.
[00:04:09.016 --> 00:04:10.857]  Five hunters killed in Wisconsin woods.
[00:04:11.197 --> 00:04:11.877]  Talk about that.
[00:04:12.257 --> 00:04:14.798]  Doctors group fights prescription reporting bill.
[00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.839]  Everything you buy will go into a federal database.
[00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.680]  Just a foreshadowing of what's coming up in the next hour.
[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.681]  My relationship to power and authority is that I'm all for it.
[00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:25.442]  U.S.
[00:04:25.462 --> 00:04:27.822]  News and World Report, 1990 profile.
[00:04:28.182 --> 00:04:29.723]  People need somebody to watch over them.
[00:04:29.743 --> 00:04:33.544]  95% of people in the world need to be told what to do and how to behave.
[00:04:35.065 --> 00:04:35.665]  Some of the Arnold.
[00:04:37.262 --> 00:04:37.882]  Stuff I've got.
[00:04:38.042 --> 00:04:38.222]  L.A.
[00:04:38.242 --> 00:04:41.463]  Times, Governor's World Tour, maybe presidential campaign trial.
[00:04:46.084 --> 00:04:48.525]  That's some of what's coming up.
[00:04:48.605 --> 00:04:52.726]  Sieg Heil, the Bush Roves, Schwarzenegger, Nazi Nexus, the destabilization.
[00:04:53.506 --> 00:04:55.186]  This is from Common Dreams, Free Press.
[00:04:55.486 --> 00:04:56.607]  Look, it's all coming up.
[00:04:56.627 --> 00:04:57.287]  There's so much more.
[00:04:57.347 --> 00:04:57.747]  Stay with us.
[00:05:03.522 --> 00:05:09.004]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.424 --> 00:05:13.666]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:13.886 --> 00:05:20.928]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.308 --> 00:05:27.410]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:28.751]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:28.951 --> 00:05:29.432]  We're good to go.
[00:05:45.888 --> 00:05:49.033]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.

[00:06:01.073 --> 00:06:09.695]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:06:09.915 --> 00:06:21.178]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:21.198 --> 00:06:24.059]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:28.500]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled,
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:39.114]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:39.354 --> 00:06:45.022]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[00:07:00.996 --> 00:07:05.359]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:09.961]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:10.101 --> 00:07:14.504]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:07:14.524 --> 00:07:15.885]  The New World Order.
[00:07:17.667 --> 00:07:21.892]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:21.952 --> 00:07:28.900]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.103]  You will lose your liberties.
[00:07:31.323 --> 00:07:35.946]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:07:38.767 --> 00:07:39.688]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:08:01.308 --> 00:08:03.529]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.971]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.253 --> 00:08:16.876]  Coming up, John Kerry told Geraldo Rivera that the October surprise came...
[00:08:18.641 --> 00:08:23.123]  Too late for him to be able to effectively counter it, and it says that bin Laden gave Bush the election.
[00:08:23.343 --> 00:08:26.244]  Why, even Karl Rove said, thank you, bin Laden, what a present.
[00:08:26.264 --> 00:08:27.985]  Of course, it wouldn't matter if Kerry got in.
[00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:30.846]  He staged the whole thing with his cousin Bush.
[00:08:31.607 --> 00:08:47.434]  Also, a former top CIA officer told NBC's Meet the Press that he admired Osama bin Laden and that he was a great person, so...
[00:08:48.863 --> 00:08:51.624]  Again, they let their true colors shine through, don't they?
[00:08:52.464 --> 00:08:55.045]  Also, tougher anti-terror laws proposed in England.
[00:08:55.165 --> 00:09:00.607]  Arrest without even being charged with a crime or without even suspicion of a crime.
[00:09:01.027 --> 00:09:03.368]  School officials asked police to stop using tasers.
[00:09:03.388 --> 00:09:09.410]  United Press International, after a 14-year-old boy refused to stop playing Game Boy and was tasered.
[00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.550]  Detroit Free Press.
[00:09:12.774 --> 00:09:17.757]  Also, we will get into, well, some of the things Bush is doing.
[00:09:17.777 --> 00:09:24.822]  I mean, a score of pro-abortion, anti-gun, pro-open border people being appointed to every position you can imagine.
[00:09:25.763 --> 00:09:38.811]  Also, Air Force coach to remove Christian Banner, the Air Force Academy's longtime football coach, has agreed to remove a Christian Banner from the team's locker room after school administrators announced they would do more to fight religious intolerance.
[00:09:39.332 --> 00:09:41.333]  Oh, see, but every other religion's okay.
[00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:49.333]  Hey, Arnold says that he doesn't like Jesus Christ, and so that is one of the books he wrote, but again, that's part of being a Christian.
[00:09:49.914 --> 00:09:51.214]  I've got to support him.
[00:09:51.574 --> 00:09:54.015]  Also, tax returns measure indefensible.
[00:09:54.075 --> 00:10:01.098]  I believe they slipped this in where the Senate can look at people's tax returns as part of political control.
[00:10:01.658 --> 00:10:10.261]  They slipped this in so they can have an emergency session, which they're going to have over the 9-11 bill with the National ID card, try to go ahead and pass their new Freedom Initiative.
[00:10:11.454 --> 00:10:12.414]  So we'll be getting into that.
[00:10:12.534 --> 00:10:18.876]  Also, a lot of people, I've been listening to talk radio, watching some TV this weekend, and people are like, what?
[00:10:18.916 --> 00:10:27.438]  There's a plan in California and Oregon and now Texas and all these other states to put satellite boxes in the cars to track and tax you?
[00:10:28.538 --> 00:10:28.818]  Why?
[00:10:28.898 --> 00:10:29.978]  I'll never put up with that.
[00:10:30.038 --> 00:10:35.340]  And then Arnold goes, well, I appointed the guy that's proposing this, but I'm not going to comment on it.
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.380]  Oh, well, he's not for it.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.300]  Then you can't criticize him.
[00:10:38.132 --> 00:10:39.552]  It's a federal plan, people.
[00:10:39.572 --> 00:10:41.353]  I've been talking about this for eight years.
[00:10:41.993 --> 00:10:42.753]  Seven, eight years.
[00:10:43.313 --> 00:10:46.034]  Since I got the federal plans, it's coming to a neighborhood near you.
[00:10:46.454 --> 00:10:55.256]  When you complain about the satellite boxes they'll install at the DMV when you get your tags or renew your license, they'll go, okay, just take this transponder.
[00:10:56.116 --> 00:11:07.079]  But the transponder then can be read from point to point with radio readers they've already been putting up that know how fast you drove and has your ID number on it so it does the exact same thing as a satellite.
[00:11:09.187 --> 00:11:11.609]  The exact same thing as a satellite.
[00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:13.471]  So they'll go, okay, just accept this.
[00:11:13.851 --> 00:11:15.312]  That's what Texas is about to do.
[00:11:15.693 --> 00:11:20.777]  California, though, they've got gullible slaves that only 48% of them voted for Arnold.
[00:11:20.797 --> 00:11:21.818]  He was in a three-way race.
[00:11:23.239 --> 00:11:25.141]  But gullible slaves will vote for him.
[00:11:25.161 --> 00:11:29.945]  Of course, Arnold won where Diebold was and lost where they weren't, so he probably didn't even win that.
[00:11:30.965 --> 00:11:32.467]  But, you know, there...
[00:11:33.641 --> 00:11:34.021]  Who knows?
[00:11:34.041 --> 00:11:36.282]  They'll probably love it and enjoy it.
[00:11:36.702 --> 00:11:38.583]  And, of course, it'll be 25 cents a mile.
[00:11:38.663 --> 00:11:41.004]  Right now in California, it's 18 cents a gallon.
[00:11:41.504 --> 00:11:43.284]  The average, what, 20-plus miles.
[00:11:43.704 --> 00:11:45.505]  The average car is 20-plus miles a gallon.
[00:11:46.125 --> 00:11:49.606]  And so that'll be roughly 20 times the current tax just when it starts.
[00:11:51.607 --> 00:11:53.188]  And it's being pushed.
[00:11:53.248 --> 00:11:54.648]  I mean, I've got the Houston Chronicle.
[00:11:54.708 --> 00:11:55.468]  I've got Reuters.
[00:11:55.528 --> 00:11:56.389]  I've got AP.
[00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:59.910]  Suddenly all these estates are announcing, hey, we're going to do this.
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.642]  Because people are driving fuel-efficient cars, which isn't really true.
[00:12:03.662 --> 00:12:04.743]  We're using more fuel than ever.
[00:12:05.083 --> 00:12:06.084]  People don't know statistics.
[00:12:06.544 --> 00:12:08.746]  And so we're not making as much money, so we've got to do this.
[00:12:08.806 --> 00:12:11.448]  Well, you just raise the gas tax if you need to do that.
[00:12:12.469 --> 00:12:14.090]  But no, no, no, no, contraire.
[00:12:15.371 --> 00:12:16.492]  No, that's not the case.
[00:12:17.192 --> 00:12:19.294]  People don't know, so they'll just go along with it.
[00:12:19.374 --> 00:12:23.377]  Oh, well, you better pay for the road, put the box in my car, and charge me 45 cents a mile.
[00:12:23.417 --> 00:12:29.982]  And now they're saying, well, also during peak times, it'd be 60 cents a mile, as I saw in the federal plan seven-plus years ago.
[00:12:31.613 --> 00:12:33.654]  So we'll be going over that for you.
[00:12:33.714 --> 00:12:34.195]  It's coming.
[00:12:34.215 --> 00:12:38.097]  They're going to do it to you and claim you voted for it on the new special voting machines.
[00:12:38.157 --> 00:12:47.622]  It's like here in Austin, major polls, 93% against the transponders and making all the major roads toll roads.
[00:12:49.403 --> 00:12:56.467]  And the mayor and the rest of them and part of the state board that's unelected just laugh and say, go ahead and vote us out and literally laugh at us.
[00:12:57.448 --> 00:12:58.808]  Houston, major poll, 98% against it.
[00:13:00.396 --> 00:13:02.698]  And the city leaders just laugh at the people.
[00:13:02.758 --> 00:13:05.920]  The state leaders just laugh at you and go, what are you going to do?
[00:13:06.961 --> 00:13:07.782]  What are you going to do?
[00:13:07.802 --> 00:13:11.565]  Our cameras, our face scanners, our license plate readers are going in.
[00:13:11.905 --> 00:13:13.627]  In England, they read you by license plate.
[00:13:14.327 --> 00:13:16.649]  The computer system scans license plates.
[00:13:16.689 --> 00:13:20.692]  It can scan thousands in a single second, more than even needed.
[00:13:20.712 --> 00:13:23.975]  It has your ID and personal ID connected to that.
[00:13:24.035 --> 00:13:26.597]  And so from camera to camera, they're going to tax you, too.
[00:13:27.802 --> 00:13:29.863]  So there's really three ways right now to do this.
[00:13:29.903 --> 00:13:34.065]  Transponder, satellite box, and a camera, license plate reader.
[00:13:34.085 --> 00:13:35.085]  They're already doing it in London.
[00:13:35.105 --> 00:13:36.426]  They read your license plate and do it.
[00:13:39.587 --> 00:13:43.809]  So they'll let people fight the satellite box, as I said they would do years ago.
[00:13:43.849 --> 00:13:45.189]  Now that's public.
[00:13:45.249 --> 00:13:46.570]  Just another plan, folks.
[00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:50.972]  It's really kind of a nightmarish existence to know the reality, to see the total picture.
[00:13:51.954 --> 00:13:56.277]  But I guess it's God's little blessing to me, and I'm actually glad that I've studied it and understand it.
[00:13:56.637 --> 00:13:57.838]  And you can understand it, too.
[00:13:57.858 --> 00:14:00.920]  Many of you probably do, and are more articulate than I am.
[00:14:03.221 --> 00:14:06.483]  Toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:14:07.203 --> 00:14:11.886]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[00:14:13.447 --> 00:14:20.832]  Eighty-plus percent of Americans are against having open borders and amnesty, including the majority of Hispanics in major polls and votes.
[00:14:21.576 --> 00:14:23.018]  Like in Arizona, they just had.
[00:14:23.619 --> 00:14:25.581]  But Bush and the Democrats do not care.
[00:14:25.842 --> 00:14:29.046]  They're unified, just like they're unified on amending the Constitution for Arnold.
[00:14:29.546 --> 00:14:31.269]  Just like they're unified on gun control.
[00:14:31.289 --> 00:14:32.691]  Just like they're unified on everything else.
[00:14:33.351 --> 00:14:35.054]  Bush renews open borders drive.
[00:14:35.094 --> 00:14:38.098]  President Bush renewed his support Sunday for changes to the U.S.
[00:14:38.138 --> 00:14:39.800]  immigration law that would allow undocumented...
[00:14:40.501 --> 00:14:41.042]  Thank you.
[00:14:59.622 --> 00:15:01.464]  But again, Bush, you know, it's like Arnold.
[00:15:01.544 --> 00:15:02.925]  Oh, that's my DMV guy.
[00:15:02.945 --> 00:15:04.787]  I don't have a comment on the satellite boxes.
[00:15:05.147 --> 00:15:12.454]  Or, oh, that's my administration bill we introduced through our senators, but I'm not going to comment on it, even though he's been commenting on it.
[00:15:12.835 --> 00:15:16.478]  I explained to the President that we share a mutual concern to make sure our border is secure.
[00:15:17.399 --> 00:15:22.624]  Bush said after meeting with Fox on the sidelines of an economic summit here for the Pan-American Union...
[00:15:23.363 --> 00:15:27.165]  One way to make sure the border is secure is to have reasonable immigration policies.
[00:15:27.225 --> 00:15:30.747]  I assure them we want people from Mexico treated with respect and dignity.
[00:15:31.567 --> 00:15:35.529]  But don't worry, they already get more welfare and ten years of tax exemption.
[00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:38.591]  Right after I was on that L.A.
[00:15:38.631 --> 00:15:42.753]  radio show Saturday night, I listened on the computer to the next show, the Crime Fighter.
[00:15:43.133 --> 00:15:48.776]  They had the crime hunter or whatever his name is, and they had the district attorney on
[00:15:49.446 --> 00:15:55.610]  Just there locally, 3,000 people in the last few years have committed murders, killed cops, raped and killed women.
[00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:59.071]  And they go to Mexico, and Mexico just lets them go free, doesn't even arrest them.
[00:16:02.774 --> 00:16:03.554]  What's their website?
[00:16:03.574 --> 00:16:04.675]  I want to get that guy on.
[00:16:05.155 --> 00:16:08.337]  EscapeFromJustice or something like that.com.
[00:16:08.377 --> 00:16:09.817]  They even launched a website about it.
[00:16:11.358 --> 00:16:12.399]  But, boy.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:21.682]  By the way, the proposal that he says is not an amnesty, it's like Waco where they're ramming tanks into the side and pumping in gas and setting it on fire on loudspeakers.
[00:16:21.702 --> 00:16:22.642]  This is not an assault.
[00:16:24.203 --> 00:16:27.804]  Well, it's the same doublespeak here, the same oxymoron here.
[00:16:28.284 --> 00:16:32.245]  It'll be a total six-year amnesty for everyone who's here, anyone that can get here.
[00:16:34.326 --> 00:16:39.187]  And they can then bring all their family here, and it allows corporations to pay to bring skilled and unskilled here.
[00:16:40.447 --> 00:16:40.587]  Ha!
[00:16:41.568 --> 00:16:43.028]  So there's your amnesty.
[00:16:45.566 --> 00:16:54.794]  With a meeting with Fox followed by a state visit with Chilean President Ricardo Lagos later Sunday and a brief stop in Colombia on Monday, Bush is aiming to dispel the perception of U.S.
[00:16:54.854 --> 00:17:00.379]  neglect of Latin America and brushing an American reputation damaged by the Iraq War.
[00:17:00.499 --> 00:17:05.383]  It's his second-term diplomatic offensive in the region akin to his recent courting in Europe.
[00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:10.570]  It's for the free trade area of the Americas coming up next year.
[00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:12.031]  That's what the meeting was about.
[00:17:12.311 --> 00:17:14.472]  But, of course, the Associated Press won't even tell you about that.
[00:17:14.792 --> 00:17:16.032]  There's not even a discussion.
[00:17:17.093 --> 00:17:23.435]  Literally, one out of maybe 50 people I talk to on the street, I do this in grocery stores and everywhere, I just ask people questions.
[00:17:24.615 --> 00:17:26.756]  They don't even know what the free trade area of the Americas is.
[00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:28.197]  They don't know the dollar's plunged by 46%.
[00:17:28.237 --> 00:17:30.177]  They don't know anything.
[00:17:33.536 --> 00:17:37.038]  And you tell them, you think Arnold should be president?
[00:17:37.058 --> 00:17:37.719]  And they go, no.
[00:17:37.779 --> 00:17:39.440]  But, well, did you hear he says he wants to be a dictator?
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.340]  And they just start giggling.
[00:17:42.322 --> 00:17:45.103]  I mean, it's just, it's total disconnect, folks.
[00:17:45.764 --> 00:17:46.864]  This is mind control.
[00:17:47.545 --> 00:17:48.805]  All of this is mind control.
[00:17:48.826 --> 00:17:50.627]  I mean, we've got a brainwashed public.
[00:17:51.087 --> 00:17:59.132]  And it's because you listen to these neocons and others on talk radio and in the so-called liberal media, it's just all wall-to-wall positive.
[00:17:59.932 --> 00:18:01.213]  Positive for gun control.
[00:18:01.293 --> 00:18:02.534]  Positive for open borders.
[00:18:03.363 --> 00:18:05.764]  Sob stories about immigrants.
[00:18:05.844 --> 00:18:07.205]  Propaganda about the war.
[00:18:07.285 --> 00:18:07.945]  Propaganda.
[00:18:09.105 --> 00:18:10.586]  We're in so much trouble.
[00:18:13.727 --> 00:18:14.868]  And the good stuff's happening.
[00:18:14.888 --> 00:18:23.371]  You know, we're able to defeat Patriot II for now and the National ID card for now, but they go, okay, we'll just bring it up right before Christmas.
[00:18:23.571 --> 00:18:28.073]  We'll just open up an emergency session, which they always do with the Federal Reserve, with the income tax.
[00:18:28.726 --> 00:18:44.981]  With the 1947 National Security Act, with the 1933 War Powers Act, with all this stuff, it's always dead of night, night before Christmas, Christmas Day, New Year's Eve, and oh, we're not going to tell you when we're going to open it back up.
[00:18:45.001 --> 00:18:47.443]  If we can get three senators, that's a quorum call.
[00:18:48.764 --> 00:18:52.868]  So everybody will leave, and then three senators will jet back to D.C.
[00:18:52.908 --> 00:18:55.070]  and wobble in there, and then they're going to do it to you.
[00:18:58.067 --> 00:19:02.848]  You ask, how's Arnold going to get the Article 2 Clause 5 taken out to be president?
[00:19:03.328 --> 00:19:05.648]  We're going to have more terror attacks in this country.
[00:19:05.668 --> 00:19:09.629]  There'll be some staged event where he saves children in a school or something.
[00:19:10.089 --> 00:19:10.689]  Hear it now.
[00:19:10.769 --> 00:19:11.490]  It's going to happen.
[00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:13.290]  He's going to save people.
[00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:14.590]  A helicopter's going to land.
[00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.891]  He's going to run into a burning building or something and save people.
[00:19:17.391 --> 00:19:19.511]  Just set your watch and warrant by it.
[00:19:21.631 --> 00:19:23.412]  Put all your shekels on it.
[00:19:24.132 --> 00:19:24.632]  I know it.
[00:19:26.087 --> 00:19:26.908]  It's going to happen.
[00:19:27.468 --> 00:19:28.469]  It's all written, folks.
[00:19:28.529 --> 00:19:29.930]  It's just as clear as a bell to me.
[00:19:31.852 --> 00:19:33.093]  Sometimes I wish it wasn't.
[00:19:33.993 --> 00:19:37.776]  Sometimes it's just sick.
[00:19:38.897 --> 00:19:40.098]  But we've got to fight, folks.
[00:19:40.138 --> 00:19:41.959]  We've got to fight so everybody knows the truth.
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:52.127]  So when they're claiming we all want microchips and they're claiming we all want this and that in the polls and at the voting booths, everybody can stand together and go, no, it's all a fraud.
[00:19:52.688 --> 00:19:54.029]  We didn't vote for that and you know it.
[00:19:55.447 --> 00:19:56.467]  Besides, we're a republic.
[00:19:56.567 --> 00:19:59.328]  You can't take the minority's rights even though the majority wants hell on earth.
[00:20:02.128 --> 00:20:06.709]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glass, who is a pharmacist from Marks Plaza Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[00:20:06.829 --> 00:20:07.209]  Hi, Alan.
[00:20:07.229 --> 00:20:08.049]  Welcome to the program.
[00:20:08.229 --> 00:20:08.789]  Thank you, Marvin.
[00:20:08.989 --> 00:20:12.350]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:13.070]  Is that true?
[00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.250]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:17.271]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[00:20:17.311 --> 00:20:17.611]  price.
[00:20:17.771 --> 00:20:19.851]  What about drugs like Cremarin and Lipitor?
[00:20:19.891 --> 00:20:20.651]  They're very common.
[00:20:20.731 --> 00:20:23.912]  Those common drugs you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[00:20:23.952 --> 00:20:24.212]  price.
[00:20:24.452 --> 00:20:25.634]  Now, what about Tamoxifen?
[00:20:25.694 --> 00:20:28.076]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[00:20:28.297 --> 00:20:32.081]  Tamoxifen, you can see a 75% savings against the regular U.S.
[00:20:32.101 --> 00:20:32.381]  price.
[00:20:32.762 --> 00:20:35.145]  Now, are these brand-name products made by the same companies?
[00:20:35.405 --> 00:20:37.427]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[00:20:37.467 --> 00:20:39.490]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.,
[00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:44.696]  So to save money on prescription drugs in Canada, call the toll-free number for your information package.
[00:20:44.936 --> 00:20:46.878]  To find out more, call toll-free 1-800-840-0686.
[00:20:46.898 --> 00:20:47.319]  That's 1-800-840-0686.
[00:20:47.359 --> 00:20:48.600]  Or go on the web at www.canshipdrugs.com.
[00:21:01.354 --> 00:21:02.115]  Terrorism.
[00:21:02.255 --> 00:21:03.015]  Terrorism.
[00:21:03.115 --> 00:21:03.956]  Chemical attacks.
[00:21:04.016 --> 00:21:04.697]  Dirty bombs.
[00:21:04.777 --> 00:21:05.197]  Fallout.
[00:21:05.277 --> 00:21:06.258]  Biological attack.
[00:21:06.458 --> 00:21:06.999]  Anthrax.
[00:21:07.059 --> 00:21:09.180]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:21:09.441 --> 00:21:11.022]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:21:11.282 --> 00:21:13.764]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:21:14.144 --> 00:21:28.716]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist with the U.S.
[00:21:28.756 --> 00:21:29.076]  government.
[00:21:29.257 --> 00:21:31.038]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:21:31.418 --> 00:21:37.320]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:41.981]  If you're not the type who waits until it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[00:21:42.221 --> 00:21:47.583]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:47.703 --> 00:21:48.923]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:21:49.003 --> 00:21:49.323]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:21:49.583 --> 00:21:51.624]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:22:00.526 --> 00:22:01.147]  Hey, psst.
[00:22:01.507 --> 00:22:07.074]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[00:22:07.314 --> 00:22:08.375]  You use deodorant, right?
[00:22:08.596 --> 00:22:09.457]  Well, let's hope you do.
[00:22:09.637 --> 00:22:12.240]  You obviously wear it to cover up embarrassing underarm odor.
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:17.306]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[00:22:17.546 --> 00:22:18.547]  Check out this new product.
[00:22:18.727 --> 00:22:21.709]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[00:22:22.009 --> 00:22:25.972]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[00:22:26.172 --> 00:22:29.154]  Look, the creator of No-B-O understands what you're going through.
[00:22:29.314 --> 00:22:35.078]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually suits the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[00:22:35.258 --> 00:22:36.639]  Now, she wants to share it with you.
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:37.700]  Still not convinced?
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:38.321]  Try it.
[00:22:38.441 --> 00:22:39.681]  Go ahead, try No-B-O.
[00:22:39.802 --> 00:22:40.642]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[00:22:42.043 --> 00:22:45.047]  NoBO is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.

[00:23:02.682 --> 00:23:07.284]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[00:23:07.604 --> 00:23:09.944]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.

[00:23:12.085 --> 00:23:17.166]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.

[00:23:18.766 --> 00:23:21.447]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.

[00:23:33.095 --> 00:23:40.901]  I can tell you there will be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.

[00:23:52.946 --> 00:23:53.907]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:55.848 --> 00:23:58.949]  Get your red book now and you'll weather any storm that comes your way.
[00:24:08.462 --> 00:24:12.083]  Shocking revelations that I've now discovered and confirmed about Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:24:12.123 --> 00:24:14.104]  He gets far worse than we first knew.
[00:24:15.184 --> 00:24:16.945]  Coming up in detail next hour.
[00:24:18.846 --> 00:24:22.627]  Right now, let's go to Bart and Jim, Charles, Joe, Carlos, and others.
[00:24:22.727 --> 00:24:23.927]  Bart in Texas, go ahead.
[00:24:24.547 --> 00:24:29.349]  Well, you know, I wanted to talk about this Morgenthaler Jones woman.
[00:24:29.509 --> 00:24:30.890]  Behind the amend for Arnold.
[00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:37.812]  Well, that lady, for me personally, and everyone else has to make this as a judgment call from the research I've done,
[00:24:38.516 --> 00:24:40.178]  That woman is the real deal.
[00:24:40.578 --> 00:24:47.626]  I mean, she is Illuminati, double thank, double personality, you know, here I am, there you go.
[00:24:47.646 --> 00:24:52.091]  Hey, I was on Bloomberg Radio with her this weekend, and I called her after the show, and I talked to her for 35 minutes.
[00:24:54.092 --> 00:24:57.793]  And I said, you've really been to Bohemian Grove, haven't you?
[00:24:57.813 --> 00:24:59.474]  Do you remember she acted kind of dumb at first?
[00:24:59.714 --> 00:25:01.094]  And she goes, yeah, I have.
[00:25:01.574 --> 00:25:04.715]  And she goes, you know, when the women are allowed in during the winter.
[00:25:05.196 --> 00:25:06.616]  And I said, your husband's part of it, isn't he?
[00:25:06.636 --> 00:25:08.817]  And she goes, well, he's a Grove member in training.
[00:25:09.217 --> 00:25:11.457]  It takes decades to even become a real member.
[00:25:11.918 --> 00:25:12.618]  And that's true.
[00:25:13.538 --> 00:25:16.239]  And so, I mean, it's bone-chilling.
[00:25:17.259 --> 00:25:22.681]  What bothers me about this woman, though, and this could be my own hypertension issue,
[00:25:23.451 --> 00:25:27.652]  Is, to be honest, she seems like an anti-synthesis to you.
[00:25:27.672 --> 00:25:50.177]  I mean, this whole thing, I've almost wondered if it's a giant psychological trap to pull you in, her name being Jones, the whole way her personality profile was the exact opposite of yours, this bubbly, happy, you know, totally untruthful personality to come to you, this truth speaker who's very aggressive and very, you know, in your face about what he thinks about.
[00:25:50.637 --> 00:25:52.718]  So, I mean, I just, this whole thing seems
[00:25:54.072 --> 00:26:01.357]  Yeah, Joe's a pretty common name and she's been a campaign person for him all along.
[00:26:02.758 --> 00:26:05.580]  It's called synchronicity.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.382]  That's what we're dealing with here.
[00:26:08.402 --> 00:26:09.343]  Anything else you want to add, Bart?
[00:26:17.583 --> 00:26:20.905]  Yeah, I heard about this program where they interview the French guy, and I go, who else says this?
[00:26:20.925 --> 00:26:23.906]  Of course, they didn't mention, well, Alex Jones said 9-11 before 9-11.
[00:26:24.707 --> 00:26:26.948]  I didn't see it, but I got a bunch of emails and calls about it.
[00:26:27.028 --> 00:26:32.811]  An hour-long special, you're with a Muslim terrorist or a foreigner, and you think there was government prior knowledge.
[00:26:32.831 --> 00:26:40.235]  Well, 90% of people in a CNN poll believe they're being lied to, and half of New Yorkers in a Zogby poll believe the government was behind it.
[00:26:40.315 --> 00:26:41.916]  So, I guess we're all crazy.
[00:26:42.628 --> 00:26:57.019]  Well, it's a total smear, but what I thought was the most funny thing about it at the end, and this really, to me, shows that they're watching you, is they very much did an InfoWars-type approach at the end, where they were like, help get involved in this.
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.240]  Help spread the truth.
[00:26:58.921 --> 00:26:59.802]  Come to our website.
[00:26:59.822 --> 00:27:05.026]  I mean, this was literally... That's what Arnold's little front-group site does.
[00:27:05.086 --> 00:27:06.187]  They need the grassroots...
[00:27:07.699 --> 00:27:12.423]  38 to 45 percent of people have tuned out of mainstream media almost entirely in major university studies.
[00:27:12.763 --> 00:27:13.704]  They're panicking.
[00:27:14.084 --> 00:27:15.425]  They're losing control.
[00:27:15.885 --> 00:27:16.766]  We're going to win.
[00:27:16.786 --> 00:27:17.406]  Thanks for the call.
[00:27:18.067 --> 00:27:18.887]  Jim in Texas.
[00:27:18.947 --> 00:27:19.748]  Jim, you're on the air.
[00:27:19.788 --> 00:27:20.188]  Go ahead.
[00:27:21.729 --> 00:27:22.210]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:22.810]  Hello.
[00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:23.891]  Here's some good news.
[00:27:24.531 --> 00:27:27.193]  I gave up one of your tapes, and I can't get it back.
[00:27:27.573 --> 00:27:28.994]  The man said he's watched it three times.
[00:27:29.034 --> 00:27:34.138]  He let his boss borrow it, and now his boss's son has got it, and he said when he gets it back, he wants to make a copy.
[00:27:34.861 --> 00:27:37.563]  So I figured, what the heck, I gave him another one to watch while I'm waiting for that one.
[00:27:39.264 --> 00:27:40.945]  Well, tell them to spread the love.
[00:27:40.965 --> 00:27:43.386]  Tell them to make copies of those videos.
[00:27:43.886 --> 00:27:44.747]  Well, he's going to make it.
[00:27:44.767 --> 00:27:45.788]  He said he's going to make copies.
[00:27:45.808 --> 00:27:49.290]  I mean, I'm now selling them for $5.95 a piece on DVD.
[00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:51.711]  People get more than one copy.
[00:27:53.132 --> 00:27:56.154]  But you're welcome to make copies of the originals.
[00:27:56.214 --> 00:27:57.275]  I just want to get the word out.
[00:27:57.675 --> 00:27:58.415]  Yeah, you know what I did?
[00:27:58.455 --> 00:28:01.277]  It's like throwing gas on fire after so many people don't want to hear it.
[00:28:01.741 --> 00:28:02.562]  I made up some signs.
[00:28:02.582 --> 00:28:04.304]  They're about 9 inches by 12 inches.
[00:28:04.324 --> 00:28:06.426]  And I got these big, bold, black, stick-on letters.
[00:28:06.806 --> 00:28:08.668]  And all they say is PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:28:08.988 --> 00:28:15.875]  I stuck them on the bulletin board by the dollar store in the windows where... in the convenience stores where they put their dry sale signs.
[00:28:16.455 --> 00:28:19.418]  I figured, just out of curiosity, if some people go to it, you know, what the heck.
[00:28:20.239 --> 00:28:22.021]  Tens of millions a month are...
[00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:32.192]  I haven't checked since Saturday, but we've had over 3 million visitors to ArnoldExposed.com, and that was two days into the launch.
[00:28:33.012 --> 00:28:34.033]  Listen, I've got something good for you.
[00:28:34.053 --> 00:28:39.614]  After Friday's broadcast, I called Senator Hutchinson and Senator Cornyn about site testing the kids.
[00:28:40.634 --> 00:28:42.035]  At Cornyn, all I got was messages.
[00:28:42.295 --> 00:28:43.315]  I couldn't get a human.
[00:28:43.355 --> 00:28:45.875]  I finally said, you know, I'd like to speak.
[00:28:45.915 --> 00:28:48.496]  I know I'm not going to get the senator, but I'd like to speak to a person.
[00:28:48.896 --> 00:28:50.436]  I said, I'd like to know where he stands on it.
[00:28:50.476 --> 00:28:52.497]  I said, I know exactly where I stand.
[00:28:53.243 --> 00:28:59.966]  With Hutchinson, the woman I called that answered the phone, she said, well, I don't know where the senator stands on that.
[00:29:00.026 --> 00:29:02.467]  She said, because let me put you with someone who can help you.
[00:29:03.588 --> 00:29:05.048]  So she puts me with some guy he didn't know.
[00:29:05.089 --> 00:29:06.609]  He put me with someone who's over the bill.
[00:29:07.089 --> 00:29:09.110]  There I got a message that they weren't in the office.
[00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:09.731]  They'll call back.
[00:29:10.431 --> 00:29:11.712]  I called back, got the girl again.
[00:29:11.752 --> 00:29:12.812]  I said, wait a minute, you don't know.
[00:29:12.872 --> 00:29:13.472]  You work for her?
[00:29:13.532 --> 00:29:14.093]  She said, yes.
[00:29:14.133 --> 00:29:14.753]  Are you a supporter?
[00:29:14.833 --> 00:29:15.033]  Yes.
[00:29:15.193 --> 00:29:16.174]  But you don't know where she stands?
[00:29:16.574 --> 00:29:19.055]  She said, well, I know where she stands, but I can't tell you.
[00:29:19.497 --> 00:29:20.677]  I said, what do you mean you can't tell me?
[00:29:20.998 --> 00:29:24.479]  Chief, they were getting so many calls on this that I'm not allowed to say what this understands.
[00:29:24.499 --> 00:29:27.680]  And that's because they're voting for it.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.321]  Thanks for the call.
[00:29:29.181 --> 00:29:30.262]  It's Bush's initiative.
[00:29:30.622 --> 00:29:32.142]  Forced psychological testing.

[00:29:35.224 --> 00:29:36.144]  Arnold for president.
[00:29:36.344 --> 00:29:36.504]  L.A.
[00:29:36.524 --> 00:29:38.645]  Times now admitting it's going to be official.
[00:29:40.266 --> 00:29:41.366]  This is what we're facing.
[00:29:42.147 --> 00:29:43.667]  Twilight Zone reality.
[00:29:44.548 --> 00:29:45.888]  Factories all shutting down.
[00:29:46.869 --> 00:29:47.429]  Be right back.
[00:29:47.449 --> 00:29:47.829]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.545 --> 00:29:52.428]  We're on the march.

[00:30:22.927 --> 00:30:26.690]  I ordered Hemtab online, and soon after taking Hemtab, the pain was gone.
[00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:28.811]  A few days later, the hemorrhoid began to shrink.

[00:33:36.308 --> 00:33:37.269]  More of that's coming up.
[00:33:37.309 --> 00:33:41.290]  We're about to go to Charles and John and Carlos and Mike and Professor...
[00:33:42.791 --> 00:33:43.171]  And others.
[00:33:43.191 --> 00:33:44.112]  But first, bear with me.
[00:33:44.132 --> 00:33:45.273]  I want to air this clip.
[00:33:46.594 --> 00:33:56.321]  Again, I've struggled with words to describe the labyrinth I've broken into concerning Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:33:56.861 --> 00:33:59.383]  The propaganda, the mindset, the level of dirt.
[00:34:00.444 --> 00:34:00.904]  All of it.
[00:34:01.244 --> 00:34:04.507]  But I've done scores of interviews on talk radio.
[00:34:05.287 --> 00:34:12.653]  Of course, it's been on CNN and the Associated Press and San Antonio Express News and a dozen other plus papers I've found of written articles.
[00:34:15.816 --> 00:34:31.228]  And going on talk radio, I in some cases got upset, in some cases I was calm, but regardless, especially in California, but Bloomberg Radio as well, I would read quotes.
[00:34:32.023 --> 00:34:52.609]  By the guy in the 90s and the 80s and the 70s defending no Nazis, saying he wants to be a dictator, saying little people need to be controlled, saying he looks down on little people, going over the drug use, the pornography, the groping, and they would just laugh at me and just call me a kook.
[00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:58.151]  Since we launched ArnoldExposed.com.
[00:34:58.171 --> 00:35:01.632]  Now, then if they kept me on long enough to take calls, all the callers were against him
[00:35:03.843 --> 00:35:09.468]  But there's a radio show out of KFI.
[00:35:09.669 --> 00:35:09.969]  What is it?
[00:35:10.029 --> 00:35:10.850]  John and Ken Show?
[00:35:12.912 --> 00:35:14.133]  And I've heard them when they were syndicated.
[00:35:14.153 --> 00:35:15.955]  They're not syndicated anymore that I know of.
[00:35:16.015 --> 00:35:16.956]  But I've heard them before.
[00:35:16.976 --> 00:35:17.976]  I don't know which one is which.
[00:35:18.017 --> 00:35:19.638]  I was on the show for like 30 minutes.
[00:35:20.899 --> 00:35:24.162]  And that's at prisonplanet.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:35:25.404 --> 00:35:26.825]  Listen to it after the show if you want to.
[00:35:26.865 --> 00:35:28.987]  But we're going to play a clip here in a second.
[00:35:29.685 --> 00:35:33.887]  And I kept bringing up factual things, and they kept saying, well, the Simon Wiesenthal Center says he's okay.
[00:35:34.768 --> 00:35:38.970]  Well, he's given them a bunch of money, between $4 and $5 million, maybe more.
[00:35:40.611 --> 00:35:50.117]  But then he goes and still hangs out with Kirk Valtime this year, and in 1999 was photographed with him in the middle of the Nazi trouble that Valtime was having as a top Nazi.
[00:35:50.577 --> 00:35:51.798]  He had to leave the U.N.
[00:35:52.778 --> 00:35:57.141]  Arnold, years later, in the middle of a firestorm over it, because he was then running for Austrian president,
[00:35:58.757 --> 00:36:05.600]  They got upset about Hader, who's also one of Arnold's buddies, but made mild comments compared to Volta when he wasn't a Nazi.
[00:36:06.441 --> 00:36:07.581]  Well, it was even bigger in 1986.
[00:36:08.141 --> 00:36:09.762]  Arnold said, I don't care about the Nazi stuff.
[00:36:09.862 --> 00:36:10.182]  I love him.
[00:36:10.202 --> 00:36:10.883]  Maria loves him.
[00:36:10.943 --> 00:36:13.864]  And toasted him in front of all the news cameras, everything.
[00:36:16.665 --> 00:36:20.887]  And they just started saying, we don't care.
[00:36:20.927 --> 00:36:22.348]  We don't care about what somebody's done in their past.
[00:36:22.388 --> 00:36:23.208]  We care about now.
[00:36:23.308 --> 00:36:26.490]  Well, it's all a bunch of propaganda about how good he is in California.
[00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:43.282]  And then I went into VolTime, who was a top intelligence officer, hunted down resistance, hunted down Americans behind enemy lines, put out these handbills saying, you know, the Jews are your enemy, rise up, kill them all.
[00:36:43.802 --> 00:36:44.483]  Stuff like this.
[00:36:46.224 --> 00:36:51.249]  Incidentally, we've been getting threats by white supremacist groups and stuff over this, and some of their emails are posted.
[00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:52.470]  It's pretty sick stuff.
[00:36:54.451 --> 00:36:55.913]  And I haven't had death threats in years.
[00:36:55.953 --> 00:36:57.254]  We've started getting some over this.
[00:37:00.819 --> 00:37:04.281]  You've got some nice groups out there supporting you, Arnold.
[00:37:04.921 --> 00:37:17.408]  And so I bring up the fact that Kurt Voltheim hunted down our soldiers, and this is what one of the hosts on the show had to say.
[00:37:17.428 --> 00:37:23.931]  And in case you think it's out of context, we have the transcript there and the whole interview posted so you can analyze it for the record.
[00:37:24.631 --> 00:37:27.593]  And think about all the talk show hosts you've heard who've gotten fired or gotten in trouble.
[00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:29.410]  And I'm not for censorship.
[00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:30.371]  I'm not even calling for that.
[00:37:30.911 --> 00:37:38.693]  Or making a bad comment about a little old lady who fell down and got hurt, or making fun of how somebody looks, or making fun of the troops, or making fun of 9-11.
[00:37:40.253 --> 00:37:42.074]  But with these guys, it's okay, I guess.
[00:37:42.654 --> 00:37:46.595]  This is what they had to say when I talked about Vol-Time hunting down our troops and killing them.
[00:37:47.135 --> 00:37:48.855]  Now go ahead and play that exchange.
[00:37:50.096 --> 00:37:50.676]  What does that mean?
[00:37:51.235 --> 00:37:55.017]  You know, Adolf Hitler was Time Magazine Man of the Year in 1933.
[00:37:55.057 --> 00:37:55.657]  Uh-huh.
[00:37:56.098 --> 00:37:59.560]  So a lot of sickos back then thought Adolf Hitler was okay.
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.901]  So you really believe Schwarzenegger's another Hitler?
[00:38:01.941 --> 00:38:04.362]  So you think he's going to be a great creator?
[00:38:04.422 --> 00:38:05.663]  He turned to being a dictator.
[00:38:05.683 --> 00:38:06.824]  You think he's going to kill everyone?
[00:38:06.864 --> 00:38:08.925]  He goes to campaigns for Kirk Valtine.
[00:38:09.005 --> 00:38:11.306]  I got him hunted down and killed American soldiers.
[00:38:11.326 --> 00:38:13.347]  It's funny, isn't it?
[00:38:13.387 --> 00:38:14.908]  Killing American soldiers is funny.
[00:38:15.208 --> 00:38:15.588]  Oh, it is.
[00:38:15.649 --> 00:38:16.089]  It's a riot.
[00:38:16.109 --> 00:38:17.249]  It's the funniest thing I've ever heard of.
[00:38:17.269 --> 00:38:17.850]  It's real funny.
[00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:18.110]  Yeah.
[00:38:20.635 --> 00:38:25.038]  And he even said one more time, look at the transcript, oh yeah, it is, yeah.
[00:38:26.058 --> 00:38:26.999]  So there you have it.
[00:38:30.561 --> 00:38:32.022]  And so that's the attitude.
[00:38:33.622 --> 00:38:36.144]  That's the attitude we're facing, that's the attitude we're dealing with.
[00:38:38.045 --> 00:38:42.908]  You know, Hitler in the bunker, they said, who do we fight on for after you commit suicide here in five minutes?
[00:38:43.688 --> 00:38:45.349]  They said, you fight for the coming man.
[00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:48.671]  A man who will rise in America.
[00:38:51.218 --> 00:39:07.629]  And we know that three years before the fall of Hitler, and then a week later the fall of Germany, they put hundreds of billions of dollars of diamonds and gold into the U.S., into Texas, into Argentina, into Switzerland.
[00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:11.072]  We know the Bushes helped manage those funds and that money at the head of it.
[00:39:12.013 --> 00:39:15.715]  We know it was, this is London Guardian now, old news for my listeners, but London Guardian now.
[00:39:15.735 --> 00:39:17.656]  13-page report.
[00:39:18.977 --> 00:39:19.458]  Confirmed.
[00:39:19.498 --> 00:39:19.758]  Admitted.
[00:39:21.901 --> 00:39:24.503]  And Skull and Bones has always been a Germanic death cult.
[00:39:24.523 --> 00:39:25.663]  So has Bohemian Grove.
[00:39:25.723 --> 00:39:27.104]  We have the Annals of the Grove.
[00:39:27.144 --> 00:39:36.069]  We have the German Chancellor in his own book, Men in Powers, saying it's an offshoot of the Druidic rituals they do in Germany and the cult there.
[00:39:40.332 --> 00:39:43.373]  And clearly, Arnold is that coming man.
[00:39:44.534 --> 00:39:51.318]  In fact, my friends, I have now found an Observer article
[00:39:52.023 --> 00:39:58.548]  Out of England, where he said almost exactly that in 1975.
[00:40:06.393 --> 00:40:09.815]  And people laughed about him being governor.
[00:40:11.596 --> 00:40:16.660]  They waited until the recall went through for McClintock, a good conservative.
[00:40:17.972 --> 00:40:20.694]  Then they bait and switch, brought in Arnold, the three-way race.
[00:40:20.854 --> 00:40:22.615]  He was elected with 48% of the vote.
[00:40:22.635 --> 00:40:24.356]  Somebody else was as well in 1933.
[00:40:25.677 --> 00:40:26.357]  Total repeat.
[00:40:27.798 --> 00:40:32.221]  And now he's traveling the world, and congressmen and senators have said they want him for president in 08.
[00:40:32.621 --> 00:40:34.382]  Now the LA Times is saying it's clear.
[00:40:35.843 --> 00:40:39.606]  His own campaign people are now quietly admitting this is the plan.
[00:40:39.626 --> 00:40:42.988]  They're going to pull some type of disaster where he's the savior.
[00:40:43.008 --> 00:40:46.390]  They're going to have a con-con or some other type of legislative maneuver.
[00:40:48.985 --> 00:40:55.828]  And during a crisis, they're going to bring that through, and then they're going to bring him to the fore, they're going to try to run him for president, and the electronic voting machines are going to hand it to him.
[00:40:55.868 --> 00:40:56.568]  How do we stop it?
[00:40:56.868 --> 00:40:57.889]  We better talk about it now.
[00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:04.611]  But in case you missed it, maybe boost that audio a bit, John.
[00:41:04.991 --> 00:41:07.372]  Play this from the John and Ken show one more time.
[00:41:09.573 --> 00:41:10.934]  Here I am talking about the ball time.
[00:41:13.792 --> 00:41:14.112]  Go ahead.
[00:41:14.332 --> 00:41:15.052]  What does that mean?
[00:41:15.512 --> 00:41:19.273]  You know, Adolf Hitler was Time Magazine Man of the Year in 1933.
[00:41:19.333 --> 00:41:19.933]  Uh-huh.
[00:41:20.353 --> 00:41:23.834]  So a lot of sickos back then thought Adolf Hitler was okay.
[00:41:24.334 --> 00:41:26.174]  So you really believe Schwarzenegger's another Hitler?
[00:41:26.194 --> 00:41:28.355]  So you think he's going to be a great creator?
[00:41:28.395 --> 00:41:28.795]  I don't know.
[00:41:28.855 --> 00:41:29.915]  He claims to be a dictator.
[00:41:29.935 --> 00:41:31.095]  You think he's going to kill everyone?
[00:41:31.115 --> 00:41:33.175]  He goes to campaigns for Kirk Valtine.
[00:41:33.355 --> 00:41:35.776]  I got him hunted down and killed American soldiers.
[00:41:36.736 --> 00:41:37.616]  It's funny, isn't it?
[00:41:37.656 --> 00:41:39.176]  Killing American soldiers is funny.
[00:41:39.436 --> 00:41:39.857]  Oh, it is.
[00:41:39.917 --> 00:41:40.357]  It's a riot.
[00:41:40.377 --> 00:41:41.517]  It's the funniest thing I've ever heard of.
[00:41:41.537 --> 00:41:42.097]  It's real funny.
[00:41:46.349 --> 00:41:48.411]  So that's the new depths, the new lows.
[00:41:48.431 --> 00:41:51.113]  If you're Arnold Schwarzenegger, you can grope as many women as you want.
[00:41:51.153 --> 00:41:53.875]  You can say you want to rule people and be a dictator as much as you want.
[00:41:54.196 --> 00:41:54.856]  Forget 1975, 78.
[00:41:55.857 --> 00:41:58.739]  How about 1990, when he was 44 years old?
[00:42:00.601 --> 00:42:04.524]  He can do interviews for Esquire two years ago and say the most lewd, horrible things about women.
[00:42:05.285 --> 00:42:05.765]  It's okay.
[00:42:06.686 --> 00:42:12.571]  He can write in his own book, Education of a Bodybuilder, how he loathes Jesus Christ and people that follow him.
[00:42:16.385 --> 00:42:22.987]  He can say it all, and he'll be bowed down before by the Christian conservatives as I saw them worship him.
[00:42:23.507 --> 00:42:35.030]  And again, I knew he was dangerous and bad and had done all this bad stuff, but I didn't until I stood there on the floor at the Republican National Convention.
[00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:41.211]  And I've talked about the evil vibe I got off Janet Reno, the evil vibe off Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton.
[00:42:42.011 --> 00:42:43.912]  I didn't really get that vibe off George Bush.
[00:42:45.023 --> 00:42:49.525]  And, you know, you've seen the video of them having me arrested just for asking him a question after a speech he gave.
[00:42:50.685 --> 00:42:55.867]  There's several of my films on the websites, prisonplanet.tv, infowars.com.
[00:42:59.308 --> 00:43:01.249]  I never got a vibe like this.
[00:43:01.329 --> 00:43:08.292]  And it wasn't just the archetypal imagery of the Beowulf or the Hercules.
[00:43:09.147 --> 00:43:22.537]  That archetypal image that all of his movies have put him in is the Savior killing the devil, sacrificing himself like Christ, over and over again sacrificing himself to save people in the Terminator movies, the Christ imagery.
[00:43:24.098 --> 00:43:35.286]  It's not just how he's in movies about cloning and total recall and the running man, shades of going to be running, or movies in 93, oh, Arnold's going to be president, a demolition man.
[00:43:37.708 --> 00:43:45.696]  It's that the elite are using him because of that imagery, because of the effect that will have worldwide with America having a person like this at its head.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:53.544]  And then I was talking to Morgenthaler Jones this weekend after I was on Bloomberg Radio with her.
[00:43:53.584 --> 00:43:55.246]  I just called up the number to see if she'd answer.
[00:43:55.266 --> 00:43:55.686]  She answered.
[00:43:55.727 --> 00:43:58.850]  I talked to her for 30 minutes, and finally I had to get off.
[00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:59.971]  The lady wouldn't stop talking.
[00:44:01.412 --> 00:44:03.474]  And she said, yeah, I've been to Bohemian Grove.
[00:44:03.514 --> 00:44:06.977]  Yeah, my husband's a member in training, which is very deep secret.
[00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:09.239]  You have to go there and be a member in training.
[00:44:09.259 --> 00:44:11.321]  They have a hundred different camps at the lowest level.
[00:44:11.401 --> 00:44:14.724]  It's all set up in a senatorial type way.
[00:44:17.527 --> 00:44:23.492]  And, you know, a caller raised some issues that were very esoteric with her.
[00:44:25.106 --> 00:44:32.890]  Some very interesting names, like Cisco Wheeler, which one in a thousand might know that name, and she just comes out and goes, oh, venturing candidates, mind control, hypnotic control.
[00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:34.691]  I mean, no one starts saying this.
[00:44:34.751 --> 00:44:40.394]  I mean, you can draw from that what you want, folks, but we've entered something here very dangerous.
[00:44:40.894 --> 00:44:43.876]  They're openly making Mexican judicial workers take the chip.
[00:44:43.936 --> 00:44:44.676]  Italy's about to do it.
[00:44:44.696 --> 00:44:46.057]  They're talking about making our troops do it.
[00:44:46.277 --> 00:44:47.518]  It's covertly already going on.
[00:44:47.538 --> 00:44:49.459]  They're putting up the face-scanning cameras.
[00:44:49.839 --> 00:44:54.041]  They're announcing the satellite tracker boxes for the cars, the transponders to track you and tax you.
[00:44:55.754 --> 00:44:57.255]  They're openly getting rid of the borders.
[00:44:57.295 --> 00:44:59.196]  They're openly cloning now.
[00:44:59.256 --> 00:45:00.696]  This weekend was totally announced.
[00:45:00.777 --> 00:45:02.237]  Bush so-called capitulated.
[00:45:02.277 --> 00:45:04.118]  The UN went ahead and went along with it.
[00:45:04.558 --> 00:45:08.260]  They admit that, well, see, it's illegal so far to clone a human and bring it to birth.
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:11.242]  But New Jersey, California legalized that over the last two years.
[00:45:11.562 --> 00:45:20.686]  These chimeras, from the mythical Greek term, it's not illegal, though, to cross a human with a chimpanzee or a human with a pig because then it's not human.
[00:45:21.247 --> 00:45:23.588]  And now the announcements are being made that from Argentina...
[00:45:24.255 --> 00:45:27.838]  To the United States, to Italy, to Canada, to Germany.
[00:45:27.918 --> 00:45:30.319]  They have got laboratories under lock and key.
[00:45:30.539 --> 00:45:34.622]  Now they're saying they're about to start showing this video of these half-human creatures.
[00:45:34.982 --> 00:45:36.523]  This is Associated Press, by the way.
[00:45:37.784 --> 00:45:38.905]  God help us!
[00:45:39.806 --> 00:45:40.746]  God help us!
[00:45:41.927 --> 00:45:43.128]  God help us!
[00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:46.911]  It may be the beast, folks.
[00:45:47.251 --> 00:45:49.352]  And I believe Arnold's going to be some lieutenant in this.
[00:45:49.372 --> 00:45:50.593]  I don't believe he's the Antichrist.
[00:45:50.653 --> 00:45:51.714]  It may be upon us.
[00:45:52.933 --> 00:45:56.794]  It's moving so fast, and I just don't have words to describe what I'm seeing.
[00:45:59.174 --> 00:46:00.935]  Charles in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:46:00.995 --> 00:46:01.455]  Go ahead.
[00:46:01.815 --> 00:46:05.855]  Yeah, Alex, I want to get this straight.
[00:46:05.875 --> 00:46:07.156]  You're on shortwave at 9.475 now?
[00:46:07.176 --> 00:46:08.296]  No, I'm at 9.985 on the shortwave.
[00:46:08.316 --> 00:46:08.416]  9.985, okay.
[00:46:08.436 --> 00:46:09.596]  I live in northeast St.
[00:46:09.616 --> 00:46:10.916]  Petersburg, Florida.
[00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:20.830]  We're good to go.
[00:46:45.848 --> 00:46:48.751]  This is the way these clowns here operate.
[00:46:48.911 --> 00:46:50.452]  What was their reason?
[00:46:50.512 --> 00:46:54.336]  Well, the neighbors had complained about a loud bang.
[00:46:54.356 --> 00:46:55.677]  There was a loud bang.
[00:46:57.039 --> 00:47:00.262]  Well, yeah, whenever they want to get in your house now, they will...
[00:47:03.098 --> 00:47:06.041]  Claim that you dialed 911 and the phone records don't show it.
[00:47:06.081 --> 00:47:07.782]  In the middle of the night, they SWAT team you.
[00:47:07.802 --> 00:47:08.803]  Oh, you got a 911 call.
[00:47:08.964 --> 00:47:10.245]  They wouldn't have SWATed me.
[00:47:10.305 --> 00:47:10.825]  I understand.
[00:47:10.865 --> 00:47:12.687]  I'm telling you what they do a lot.
[00:47:12.807 --> 00:47:14.649]  Or a neighbor claimed they heard a loud bang.
[00:47:14.949 --> 00:47:20.614]  Well, they got my ID and let me go, but they cut my arm and they cut my hand.
[00:47:20.654 --> 00:47:21.515]  You know, I was bleeding.
[00:47:22.076 --> 00:47:25.479]  They gave me a bandage.
[00:47:25.539 --> 00:47:28.862]  That was like in Detroit when a woman got out of the car and they thought she was drunk driving.
[00:47:29.537 --> 00:47:29.637]  Uh...
[00:47:55.485 --> 00:47:57.627]  Yeah, where do you think Bohemian Grove came in?
[00:47:57.667 --> 00:48:01.870]  Did it come out of that bunch of Satanists that controlled San Francisco in the 1848 time?
[00:48:02.211 --> 00:48:06.894]  Yeah, it was founded in 1873.
[00:48:07.975 --> 00:48:10.517]  And by 1900, presidents were attending.
[00:48:10.537 --> 00:48:12.579]  By 1915, foreign leaders were attending.
[00:48:12.959 --> 00:48:22.247]  Traveling by plane later, you know, by the 30s, but they would travel by ship and then by train just to go there across the entire United States.
[00:48:22.507 --> 00:48:23.148]  Thanks for the call.
[00:48:24.208 --> 00:48:24.329]  And...
[00:48:25.911 --> 00:48:30.452]  German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, men in power, said we do rituals there.
[00:48:30.592 --> 00:48:31.492]  His own autobiography.
[00:48:31.532 --> 00:48:33.633]  I mean, I'm the cook for reporting his autobiography.
[00:48:33.673 --> 00:48:34.993]  I know.
[00:48:35.033 --> 00:48:35.633]  Heaven help us.
[00:48:35.873 --> 00:48:36.873]  Joe in Ohio.
[00:48:36.953 --> 00:48:37.833]  Joe, go ahead.
[00:48:39.774 --> 00:48:40.814]  Say it ain't so, Joe.
[00:48:40.854 --> 00:48:41.374]  You hung up.
[00:48:41.854 --> 00:48:43.715]  Carlos in California.
[00:48:43.755 --> 00:48:44.195]  Go ahead.
[00:48:44.695 --> 00:48:45.255]  Hey, Alex.
[00:48:45.355 --> 00:48:49.936]  I was going to talk about immigration, but this thing about Arnold sounds more interesting.
[00:48:50.516 --> 00:48:54.977]  You know, let's remember that prior to him becoming governor, he and Warren Buffett
[00:48:55.615 --> 00:48:59.400]  You know, that is significant because that's probably where he got his political blessing.
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.062]  And that is significant also...
[00:49:16.351 --> 00:49:23.834]  Because the Rothschild Banking family has been one of the premier families pushing the quest for a new world order.
[00:49:24.454 --> 00:49:28.255]  I was reading mainstream articles last night for four hours researching.
[00:49:28.316 --> 00:49:29.436]  I just had to keep researching.
[00:49:30.285 --> 00:49:44.437]  And it was all these articles out of Germany and England about Arnold, about how when he was really young, they'd have Mr. Getty and all these big billionaires would come just to see him and sit in the front row, and other rich lords and people.
[00:49:44.457 --> 00:49:48.080]  When he was then in England, he was just a friend of them.
[00:49:49.281 --> 00:49:57.007]  Well, you know, I guess he is a Nazi, and that's really not surprising, because if we go back historically...
[00:49:57.754 --> 00:50:11.420]  Nazism and Communism were born at about the same time in a meeting in New York, which the Rothschild Banking family had jurisdiction of.
[00:50:12.081 --> 00:50:25.127]  And at that meeting, the League of Just Fans gave the commission and the authority to Karl Marx to write the Communist Manifesto, but they also gave it to a man named Karl Ritter,
[00:50:25.714 --> 00:50:28.176]  To write the ideology for Nazism.
[00:50:28.196 --> 00:50:35.101]  Did you know Karl Rove, one of his very close ancestors, was a top propagandist for Der Fuhrer?
[00:50:35.922 --> 00:50:37.023]  It doesn't stop.
[00:50:37.684 --> 00:50:39.005]  It's all connected.
[00:50:40.346 --> 00:50:40.786]  Of course.
[00:50:40.866 --> 00:50:43.989]  You know, the New World War creates all these different ideologies.
[00:50:44.029 --> 00:50:46.130]  Communism, capitalism, Zionism.
[00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:50.093]  They created all those Zionism and they pit them all against each other.
[00:50:50.213 --> 00:50:52.595]  It's now come out that the Zionists actually helped Hitler.
[00:50:52.735 --> 00:50:53.236]  Anything else?
[00:50:54.361 --> 00:50:55.221]  Oh, that's it.
[00:50:55.282 --> 00:50:56.482]  All right, thanks for the call.
[00:50:56.522 --> 00:50:57.703]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:50:57.723 --> 00:50:58.423]  More calls coming up.
[00:51:00.324 --> 00:51:02.965]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.145 --> 00:51:06.226]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.366 --> 00:51:10.268]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.308 --> 00:51:14.550]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:18.672]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.752 --> 00:51:20.613]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:21.193 --> 00:51:24.116]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[00:51:24.136 --> 00:51:28.861]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.021 --> 00:51:32.064]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.244 --> 00:51:35.107]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.608 --> 00:51:41.714]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.234 --> 00:51:43.716]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[00:52:00.942 --> 00:52:05.905]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.

[00:52:23.394 --> 00:52:32.761]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:52:33.022 --> 00:52:36.524]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:52:36.764 --> 00:52:43.870]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[00:53:55.536 --> 00:54:13.369]  You know, I've been a guest many times on Man Cal Muller's number one talk show in Chicago, and it's syndicated as well.
[00:54:14.426 --> 00:54:16.587]  And he's, you know, it's a madhouse.
[00:54:16.727 --> 00:54:22.049]  But I want to get the view of a talk show host who's kind of in the middle of the road on the whole New World Order thing.
[00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:26.591]  We'll get more into Schwarzenegger later in the next hour, some of these new big revelations.
[00:54:27.351 --> 00:54:28.312]  And, of course, your calls.
[00:54:28.332 --> 00:54:30.133]  But I've got a bunch of other news we will be covering.
[00:54:30.993 --> 00:54:36.895]  He was supposed to be on 30 minutes ago, and somehow stuff's so wild around here, I didn't get that to the folks that are supposed to call him up.
[00:54:36.915 --> 00:54:38.916]  So he's coming on in the next hour.
[00:54:38.936 --> 00:54:40.057]  Before I go to...
[00:54:42.506 --> 00:54:48.271]  Mike and Professor and others that are patiently holding, I have made 11 films.
[00:54:49.952 --> 00:54:51.333]  And they expose the New World Order.
[00:54:51.393 --> 00:54:54.996]  They are really good at unlocking people's minds because they're an overdose of the truth.
[00:54:55.937 --> 00:54:57.898]  The globalists in their own words, their own documents.
[00:54:59.259 --> 00:55:03.703]  Whether it's the police state, I've got three police state films, the foreign troops, the camps, it's all documented.
[00:55:04.903 --> 00:55:06.585]  The rumors end, the documentation begins.
[00:55:07.125 --> 00:55:07.966]  Or my newest film,
[00:55:08.988 --> 00:55:13.432]  American dictators documenting the staged election of 2004 to understand what that fraud was.
[00:55:14.332 --> 00:55:15.253]  Such an important film.

[00:56:53.392 --> 00:56:54.713]  Let's go ahead and go to Mike.
[00:56:55.774 --> 00:56:57.875]  Mike, where are you calling from?
[00:56:58.816 --> 00:56:59.497]  Hey, Alex.
[00:56:59.597 --> 00:57:00.257]  I'm calling from Michigan.
[00:57:00.277 --> 00:57:00.437]  Welcome.
[00:57:00.718 --> 00:57:01.038]  Welcome.
[00:57:02.314 --> 00:57:12.503]  Something that I'm not sure if you know about, recently I've been reading the Bible a lot, just had like a lot of free time, and I came upon Mullet.
[00:57:12.983 --> 00:57:23.712]  And I, up until that point, had no idea that he was actually, that Mullet, as you saw in everything from Bohemian Grove... Yeah, that's who our Christian leaders worship.
[00:57:23.953 --> 00:57:24.173]  Yeah.
[00:57:25.454 --> 00:57:27.616]  And I had no idea that he was even in, like...
[00:57:28.506 --> 00:57:33.547]  I think about ten times, you know, don't give your children to the fires of Moloch.
[00:57:34.267 --> 00:57:36.468]  Your country will be cursed if your leaders worship Moloch.
[00:57:36.688 --> 00:57:36.908]  Right.
[00:57:37.448 --> 00:57:37.648]  Right.
[00:57:37.828 --> 00:57:48.291]  And then, you know, I've always kind of kept like this, like the political activism and like my Christianity separate, but now it seems like it's just completely impossible to do that.
[00:57:50.171 --> 00:57:54.052]  There's a website, there's actually self-proclaimed prophet
[00:57:54.605 --> 00:57:55.666]  His name is Kim Clement.
[00:57:55.986 --> 00:57:56.987]  I don't know, have you ever heard of him?
[00:57:57.127 --> 00:57:57.748]  No, I haven't.
[00:57:57.808 --> 00:57:58.969]  I don't... Okay.
[00:57:59.729 --> 00:58:09.637]  Basically, what he's doing, and he has, like, a lot of movement behind him, he's speaking, he claims to speak for God, and, like, this guy's, like, he's been on, like, TBN and all the big... Oh, yeah, you all got to watch that.
[00:58:10.038 --> 00:58:12.680]  Really, anybody who's on these shows and doing that.
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:14.501]  I'm sure he's telling us George Bush is going to save us.
[00:58:14.882 --> 00:58:16.863]  Yeah, yeah, he's completely behind George Bush.
[00:58:16.883 --> 00:58:19.305]  I'm a prophet of God, and I say Bush is very good, I guess.
[00:58:19.465 --> 00:58:19.786]  Yeah.
[00:58:19.806 --> 00:58:22.328]  So, anyway, I mean, I just...
[00:58:23.797 --> 00:58:25.138]  It might be worth looking into.
[00:58:25.419 --> 00:58:26.700]  It's just something that struck me.
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:27.921]  Very interesting.
[00:58:27.961 --> 00:58:28.721]  Thanks for the call.
[00:58:28.981 --> 00:58:30.563]  We'll be back with the second hour.
[00:58:30.583 --> 00:58:31.363]  A ton of news.
[00:58:32.204 --> 00:58:33.785]  Man Cal Muller.
[00:58:35.326 --> 00:58:37.268]  And some new revelations on Schwarzenegger.
[00:58:38.248 --> 00:58:39.009]  The open borders.
[00:58:39.549 --> 00:58:40.770]  The satellite tracking boxes.
[00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:42.231]  I want to go over the real details of this.
[00:58:42.712 --> 00:58:46.274]  But there's no question out there for the poor public that seems to be uninformed on this.
[00:58:46.895 --> 00:58:47.876]  We'll be back with the second hour.
[00:58:47.896 --> 00:58:48.356]  Stay with us.
[00:58:57.995 --> 00:58:58.636]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.296 --> 00:59:00.377]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.078 --> 00:59:02.158]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.819 --> 00:59:03.660]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:05.341]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.981 --> 00:59:09.644]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.165 --> 00:59:14.288]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.488 --> 00:59:18.111]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:59:18.151 --> 00:59:18.912]  until 2 p.m.
[00:59:18.932 --> 00:59:24.556]  Central on the AM and FM dial, the internet at infowars.com, and Global Shortwave during the day at 9.985, at night at 3210.
[00:59:27.677 --> 00:59:28.858]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:59:29.318 --> 00:59:31.380]  New revelations I've dug up on Schwarzenegger.
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:31.901]  Confirmed.
[00:59:32.041 --> 00:59:32.881]  Mainstream stuff.
[00:59:33.342 --> 00:59:34.843]  Bombshell info coming up.
[00:59:34.923 --> 00:59:35.704]  More on our movement.
[00:59:36.184 --> 00:59:36.504]  Arnold.
[00:59:38.566 --> 00:59:39.507]  Exposed.com.
[00:59:39.547 --> 00:59:40.608]  Americans against Arnold.
[00:59:40.648 --> 00:59:44.551]  Of course, big talk show out in Los Angeles.
[00:59:44.611 --> 00:59:47.013]  I brought up how a ball time hunted down American soldiers.
[00:59:47.053 --> 00:59:48.574]  I made a joke about it and said they didn't care.
[00:59:48.594 --> 00:59:50.195]  We're going to play that clip again.
[00:59:50.215 --> 00:59:51.496]  I want to get your comments on that.
[00:59:51.937 --> 00:59:53.478]  A lot on the open border proposal.
[00:59:53.538 --> 00:59:55.339]  What's happened legislative over the weekend.
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:57.081]  Some big legislative movements.
[00:59:58.345 --> 01:00:02.868]  They're going to try to open it back up again during December and try to get all this stuff rammed through.
[01:00:03.648 --> 01:00:13.313]  And Mad Cow, Man Cow, Muller's coming up to kind of get the view of an interesting talk show host on all this.
[01:00:13.353 --> 01:00:15.595]  One of the biggest talk shows in the Midwest.
[01:00:16.635 --> 01:00:17.256]  Or the biggest.
[01:00:17.296 --> 01:00:20.017]  Let's go ahead and talk to Professor in Georgia.
[01:00:20.057 --> 01:00:20.778]  Go ahead, Professor.
[01:00:20.798 --> 01:00:22.739]  I'm driving in downtown Columbus.
[01:00:22.759 --> 01:00:23.659]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:00:23.679 --> 01:00:24.620]  Good to talk to you again.
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:24.940]  Good.
[01:00:26.022 --> 01:00:30.144]  You know, you say about four years ago I called you initially with... That's right.
[01:00:30.184 --> 01:00:32.745]  I talked to you during a break earlier when I noticed the named professor.
[01:00:33.145 --> 01:00:34.666]  You called in and said, watch Schwarzenegger.
[01:00:34.706 --> 01:00:35.086]  You'll see.
[01:00:35.106 --> 01:00:36.246]  I've been doing a lot of research.
[01:00:36.706 --> 01:00:38.747]  Yeah, it happened in the end of 1990.
[01:00:38.787 --> 01:00:40.688]  Can I tell about the vision briefly?
[01:00:40.728 --> 01:00:41.328]  What I saw?
[01:00:41.428 --> 01:00:42.029]  What happened?
[01:00:42.409 --> 01:00:45.410]  Well, on the record, you called four years ago about this and said all this.
[01:00:45.450 --> 01:00:46.070]  So go ahead.
[01:00:46.090 --> 01:00:48.051]  I don't like getting into stuff like that, but go ahead.
[01:00:48.531 --> 01:00:50.192]  The whole vision took about five seconds.
[01:00:50.252 --> 01:00:52.593]  It was so simple and so quick.
[01:00:53.281 --> 01:00:56.205]  A man walks up to me, never saw him before in my life.
[01:00:56.245 --> 01:00:58.769]  He says, did you know Arnold Schwarzenegger is the Antichrist?
[01:00:59.109 --> 01:00:59.970]  I don't believe that.
[01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:00.811]  Just let me add that.
[01:01:00.912 --> 01:01:02.293]  I don't believe that's the case.
[01:01:02.374 --> 01:01:04.857]  Were you asleep when this happened or were you awake?
[01:01:05.734 --> 01:01:06.775]  I was asleep.
[01:01:07.295 --> 01:01:09.057]  It happened, and I woke up when it ended.
[01:01:09.117 --> 01:01:10.558]  I mean, you know, I woke up startled.
[01:01:11.298 --> 01:01:14.021]  You know, when you have one... Yeah, a waking dream.
[01:01:14.041 --> 01:01:15.021]  Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
[01:01:15.061 --> 01:01:16.703]  Well, I mean, I woke up startled.
[01:01:17.043 --> 01:01:20.626]  I heard the... You know, anyway, this guy says, Did you know Arnold Schwarzenegger is the Antichrist?
[01:01:20.706 --> 01:01:21.627]  I said, No, I did not.
[01:01:21.947 --> 01:01:23.268]  He said, Well, here it is in the Bible.
[01:01:23.308 --> 01:01:27.371]  He opens the Bible, and I see red-lettered... It's a red-letter edition Bible.
[01:01:27.631 --> 01:01:30.133]  I see in red letters, that would mean the words of Jesus.
[01:01:30.514 --> 01:01:32.315]  It says, Arnold Schwarzenegger is the Antichrist.
[01:01:32.655 --> 01:01:34.556]  And, of course, my mouth dropped open and I looked at him.
[01:01:34.776 --> 01:01:36.137]  Well, it's over.
[01:01:36.317 --> 01:01:37.117]  And I wake up.
[01:01:37.377 --> 01:01:38.778]  So I'm thinking, that ain't true.
[01:01:38.878 --> 01:01:39.598]  What's going on?
[01:01:39.879 --> 01:01:43.420]  So I decide, well, you know, at that time there were commercials on TV.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:48.523]  Arnold Schwarzenegger had been named by George Herbert Walker Bush when he was president.
[01:01:49.063 --> 01:01:51.104]  He had named Arnold Schwarzenegger as the...
[01:01:52.012 --> 01:01:54.693]  Health advisor to the nation, the health and fitness advisor.
[01:01:55.093 --> 01:02:02.436]  So I said, okay, he's married to a Kennedy, he's in the President's Council for Fitness, you know, he's the fitness czar.
[01:02:02.756 --> 01:02:05.298]  I'm thinking, well, what if he does have political aspirations?
[01:02:05.358 --> 01:02:06.558]  Wait, he can't be president.
[01:02:06.978 --> 01:02:08.999]  I looked up his name, just to see what it means.
[01:02:09.479 --> 01:02:12.861]  I thought Schwartzen meant darken and blacken, but what does Neger mean?
[01:02:12.901 --> 01:02:20.564]  Well, Neger derives from the Latin, N-G-E-R-N-E-R, where we get the word negros, and, you know...
[01:02:21.482 --> 01:02:26.567]  We've got all these movies where The Running Man, Total Recall, other movies saying he's going to be president.
[01:02:43.545 --> 01:02:46.086]  Remember Bohemian Grove, 86?
[01:02:47.427 --> 01:02:47.947]  All of this.
[01:02:47.987 --> 01:02:48.807]  It goes on and on.
[01:02:48.867 --> 01:02:51.008]  His mother marrying the head of the Austrian Parliament.
[01:02:51.228 --> 01:02:53.129]  Another top Nazi after his father dies.
[01:02:53.469 --> 01:02:55.050]  He's definitely on the elite track.
[01:02:55.490 --> 01:03:01.312]  Well, you know, perception is reality in a lot of cases, and the world has seen all these Schwarzenegger movies.
[01:03:01.612 --> 01:03:03.413]  I mean, he's one of the top draws in Hollywood.
[01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:09.756]  How many times have we seen him save the world, whether it's Terminator 2, T3, whether it's End of Days?
[01:03:10.056 --> 01:03:12.457]  We see him again and again in these movies.
[01:03:12.817 --> 01:03:13.337]  In these roles.
[01:03:13.377 --> 01:03:18.020]  Now, I'm just saying, the world, mind you, they've been brainwashed by Hollywood in a lot of ways.
[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:24.543]  I mean, Hollywood basically stands for the wood that's used in a magic wand is Hollywood.
[01:03:24.703 --> 01:03:25.963]  The magic of pencil town.
[01:03:26.003 --> 01:03:26.924]  How many times have we heard it?
[01:03:27.184 --> 01:03:36.108]  They spun this web into our mind that this guy is the kind of guy that would be there fighting evil at the end.
[01:03:36.448 --> 01:03:39.450]  And he's not the Antichrist, but he is the anti-beast.
[01:03:39.884 --> 01:03:40.925]  They will use him.
[01:03:41.145 --> 01:03:52.571]  They're raising him up, the rich people, the powers that be, the money powers, to challenge the Antichrist at such a point in time, and then all the dirt will come out on... We'll be right back.
[01:03:53.611 --> 01:03:57.953]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:58.133 --> 01:04:02.576]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.696 --> 01:04:07.078]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:07.118 --> 01:04:08.479]  The New World Order...
[01:04:10.241 --> 01:04:14.465]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.525 --> 01:04:21.473]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.593 --> 01:04:23.616]  You will lose your liberty.

[01:04:34.582 --> 01:04:39.965]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:07:16.089 --> 01:07:21.914]  All right, eight minutes, 30 seconds into the second hour, November 22nd broadcast.
[01:07:23.475 --> 01:07:28.239]  Coming up, lawmakers say intelligence bill not dead, the one with the national ID card and
[01:07:29.492 --> 01:07:36.834]  All of it's going to be coming back up, like they do with a lot of police state legislation, right before the new year, right before Christmas.
[01:07:37.814 --> 01:07:40.595]  Also, for psychological testing, not dead yet.
[01:07:40.775 --> 01:07:42.756]  Every child in America to be psychologically tested.
[01:07:43.116 --> 01:07:46.117]  The type of airport screening you see in the airports to be everywhere.
[01:07:46.197 --> 01:07:50.578]  Buses in your cars, hardened checkpoints, satellite tracker systems in the cars.
[01:07:50.858 --> 01:07:52.499]  It's now on the Houston Chronicle everywhere.
[01:07:52.519 --> 01:07:53.639]  They're very proud of it.
[01:07:54.059 --> 01:07:57.300]  We'll get more to some new revelations I've dug up on Lord Schwarzenegger.
[01:07:59.586 --> 01:08:00.928]  Believe me, you do not want to miss.
[01:08:01.508 --> 01:08:03.810]  It gets even worse if you think this is actually possible.
[01:08:04.131 --> 01:08:07.794]  But right now, I'm honored to be joined by the number one talk show host in Chicago.
[01:08:07.835 --> 01:08:10.417]  He's syndicated on a lot of big blowtorch stations.
[01:08:10.457 --> 01:08:12.519]  He's Man Cal Muller.
[01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:16.043]  And I've been on his broadcast, I don't know, 20-something times.
[01:08:16.723 --> 01:08:17.124]  Alex Jones Show!
[01:08:17.144 --> 01:08:17.544]  We're good to go.
[01:08:17.564 --> 01:08:17.704]  I think?
[01:08:44.199 --> 01:08:46.721]  I have something I think your listeners will find fascinating.
[01:08:47.781 --> 01:08:48.041]  I hope.
[01:08:49.042 --> 01:08:53.665]  I hosted in Chicago the premiere of the new blockbuster called Alexander.
[01:08:55.246 --> 01:08:57.767]  And I was appalled by it.
[01:08:58.248 --> 01:09:01.950]  Look, Oliver Stone had a problem with the movie The Doors.
[01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:05.212]  The rest of The Doors were still alive to say that it was wrong.
[01:09:06.533 --> 01:09:09.875]  The Nixon administration, most of those people were still alive.
[01:09:10.155 --> 01:09:11.696]  So the Nixon movie failed.
[01:09:11.876 --> 01:09:13.437]  JFK failed because
[01:09:14.733 --> 01:09:15.113]  Can't stand her?
[01:09:15.153 --> 01:09:15.273]  Yeah.
[01:09:15.293 --> 01:09:15.374]  Well...
[01:09:43.581 --> 01:09:45.402]  I'm going to quote from the movie here.
[01:09:45.462 --> 01:09:47.643]  First of all, Alexander's hero is Achilles.
[01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:50.384]  Now, if you know your history at all, you know Achilles was a great warrior.
[01:09:50.964 --> 01:09:52.504]  But why is he admired in this movie?
[01:09:52.985 --> 01:09:57.866]  Because he had a true, pure, homosexual relationship with another man.
[01:09:58.226 --> 01:10:00.047]  He had a great love, and that's to be admired.
[01:10:00.867 --> 01:10:04.048]  We're instructed by Anthony Hopkins... People are going to think I'm making this up.
[01:10:04.889 --> 01:10:09.790]  We are instructed by Anthony Hopkins that when men sleep together and have intercourse...
[01:10:12.273 --> 01:10:14.615]  With ignorance, it is bad.
[01:10:15.495 --> 01:10:28.344]  But when men lie together and are together physically with knowledge, it is the basis of society, modern civilization.
[01:10:28.865 --> 01:10:36.370]  We are taught in this movie, I'm not gay, I'm not headed that way, but I don't care what people do in their bedroom, Alex, I should tell you.
[01:10:37.031 --> 01:10:37.391]  However,
[01:10:39.149 --> 01:10:47.214]  Even your gay listeners would be shocked to find out that the basis of society is sodomy.
[01:10:48.315 --> 01:10:49.876]  It is the most insane movie.
[01:10:52.958 --> 01:10:57.601]  It's revisionist.
[01:10:58.061 --> 01:10:59.863]  But here's what it illustrates.
[01:11:01.204 --> 01:11:07.528]  This is the same Hollywood that told us that the movie about Jesus Christ that Mel Gibson did would be a flop.
[01:11:08.499 --> 01:11:13.960]  That Mel Gibson would be destroyed, yet they continue to embrace Oliver Stone and his garbage.
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:19.602]  If you watch any of the entertainment shows, they will tell you this is the hot movie of the year.
[01:11:20.222 --> 01:11:22.683]  But the numbers don't line up.
[01:11:22.743 --> 01:11:32.525]  Well, Mankow, at Mankow.com, they also said that that Brad Pitt movie about Achilles would be great, but it was a gigantic flop.
[01:11:32.585 --> 01:11:34.005]  Yeah, and this movie is going to flop.
[01:11:34.225 --> 01:11:36.666]  Look, people went to see the movie about Jesus.
[01:11:37.014 --> 01:11:38.255]  They're going to see The Incredibles.
[01:11:38.656 --> 01:11:39.937]  They want some wholesomeness.
[01:11:40.097 --> 01:11:41.478]  I think The Incredibles was incredible.
[01:11:41.718 --> 01:11:42.939]  Yeah, I loved it.
[01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:47.143]  But the point is, Hollywood is really, really out of touch.
[01:11:47.223 --> 01:11:50.846]  I couldn't believe that they would try to perpetrate this on the American public.
[01:11:50.866 --> 01:11:52.228]  Well, actually, this is deep down.
[01:11:53.249 --> 01:11:58.232]  At the base of a lot of the leadership, this is really kind of the cult that runs things.
[01:11:58.292 --> 01:12:00.754]  I mean, Richard Nixon said that about Bohemian Grove.
[01:12:00.774 --> 01:12:02.415]  I have the audio clip of that.
[01:12:03.016 --> 01:12:05.418]  And so many of our leaders are completely into this.
[01:12:05.658 --> 01:12:15.205]  We kind of see a shade of that in Team America where the head CIA guy says, you've got to do this to one of his minions in a puppet movie.
[01:12:15.365 --> 01:12:17.387]  This is how you get power and get the go-ahead.
[01:12:17.747 --> 01:12:20.609]  So, Manco, I think you've hit upon something here.
[01:12:20.629 --> 01:12:21.490]  But didn't you love that movie?
[01:12:22.296 --> 01:12:23.837]  Hi, how's it going?
[01:12:23.857 --> 01:12:24.818]  How you doing, buddy?
[01:12:24.838 --> 01:12:26.199]  Didn't you think it was fun?
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:29.101]  Yeah, it was out of control, though.
[01:12:29.722 --> 01:12:35.887]  And the Alamo was another recent movie that was big budget, and they keep trying to rewrite it.
[01:12:35.907 --> 01:12:37.228]  We've got to keep an eye on this, Alex.
[01:12:38.028 --> 01:12:39.570]  Hey, listen, I do have a question for you.
[01:12:39.810 --> 01:12:40.851]  Okay.
[01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:47.636]  Are you saying on your show, because I've had people calling me saying they've heard it on your show, are you saying on your radio show that
[01:12:48.061 --> 01:12:54.242]  That we're fudging the numbers and that we're dumping bodies and hiding American dead in Iraq?
[01:12:55.763 --> 01:12:56.583]  Well, I know this.
[01:12:57.503 --> 01:13:09.566]  The Pentagon says that they don't count as a battle injury or a battle death if the person dies once they leave the scene.
[01:13:11.129 --> 01:13:11.850]  Confirmed that.
[01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:18.015]  They followed another... And there's all these every day, a death by a car running over somebody, or death by a helicopter crashing.
[01:13:18.035 --> 01:13:20.837]  You see the video of the helicopter being blown up.
[01:13:20.937 --> 01:13:23.420]  So, in Vietnam... What was it?
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:24.461]  Let me get the memory here.
[01:13:25.261 --> 01:13:26.302]  We lost 6,000 troops.
[01:13:27.992 --> 01:13:28.933]  Well, and I think it happens.
[01:13:28.953 --> 01:13:31.475]  I mean, I saw a big report about Philadelphia, but in Chicago and elsewhere...
[01:13:50.509 --> 01:13:55.271]  They like to talk about how crime is disappearing, but what they're doing is they're fudging the numbers.
[01:13:55.331 --> 01:13:56.191]  They're hiding numbers.
[01:13:56.231 --> 01:13:58.011]  They're classifying things differently.
[01:13:58.672 --> 01:14:11.175]  So some guy that's on a mission and his tank goes over the side of a mountain and he's crippled, as I saw last night on 60 Minutes, that doesn't count because they don't think the American public can handle the amount of casualties, right?
[01:14:11.956 --> 01:14:12.256]  Yes, sir.
[01:14:12.836 --> 01:14:13.276]  And I get it.
[01:14:13.596 --> 01:14:14.537]  I think they're probably right.
[01:14:14.597 --> 01:14:16.437]  It's a sad affair.
[01:14:16.817 --> 01:14:19.118]  I think what we've done over there has been worth it.
[01:14:20.928 --> 01:14:31.292]  Well, see, you'll have me on to talk about the New World Order and the Federal Reserve and the Illuminati and all this, and you don't censor me, and you're against the Patriot Act and the police state and the rest of it because you've experienced it yourself at the airport.
[01:14:31.352 --> 01:14:31.572]  Yes, sir.
[01:14:31.592 --> 01:14:34.493]  Why don't you tell folks, but then you have different views on the war.
[01:14:35.314 --> 01:14:36.254]  I've said this about the war.
[01:14:37.179 --> 01:14:47.284]  If we're going to be there, Bush was wrong for the election for two months to not let them go into Fallujah when the top brass said it'll cause double the casualties, but they didn't want to do it because it was unpopular.
[01:14:47.504 --> 01:14:50.505]  So if you look at it in a Machiavellian view, if you're there to win, it's like Vietnam.
[01:14:50.945 --> 01:14:59.029]  I'm totally against this war because it's not there to be won, and it's not going to be won because the military brass told them 400,000 troops or were cooked.
[01:14:59.289 --> 01:15:01.110]  You can't do it with 140,000 troops.
[01:15:01.290 --> 01:15:04.131]  So, man, Cal, just from that angle, you should be against the war.
[01:15:04.371 --> 01:15:05.432]  Well, is it possible?
[01:15:06.431 --> 01:15:14.996]  Is it possible, let me just give you this scenario, that it was absolutely brilliant to say that we can't do... It reminds me of Butterfly McQueen in Gone with the Wind.
[01:15:15.316 --> 01:15:16.897]  I don't know nothing about birth and no babies.
[01:15:17.557 --> 01:15:20.178]  We can't... Oh my God, we can't even... They've got Fallujah.
[01:15:20.218 --> 01:15:21.359]  We can't go near Fallujah.
[01:15:21.879 --> 01:15:25.541]  So they come from all over the Mideast, all these radical Muslims, and they camp there.
[01:15:26.162 --> 01:15:27.662]  We can't do anything about Fallujah.
[01:15:27.923 --> 01:15:28.923]  I thought we had lost it.
[01:15:29.323 --> 01:15:31.124]  And then we surround it and kill a bunch of them.
[01:15:31.465 --> 01:15:33.986]  It may have been a brilliant move, and we have to get...
[01:15:34.711 --> 01:15:40.336]  I think we have to germinate democracy, some sort of sense of something there, in this radical part of the world.
[01:15:41.097 --> 01:15:43.399]  Well, let's talk about that.
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:45.041]  You ought to have him on.
[01:15:45.061 --> 01:15:45.742]  You probably already have.
[01:15:45.762 --> 01:15:51.907]  Dr. Rocky, who wrote the book, literally his name, wrote the book on DU for Los Alamos, was sent there after the 91 War.
[01:15:51.947 --> 01:15:53.529]  Most of his team died.
[01:15:53.889 --> 01:15:55.631]  He's deadly ill, had cancer several times.
[01:15:56.491 --> 01:15:58.132]  They admit the DU is killing our troops.
[01:15:58.152 --> 01:16:01.312]  This time they bombarded the bases that our troops then moved in with.
[01:16:01.753 --> 01:16:03.453]  They dumped some sand on top of it.
[01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:04.613]  Does nothing.
[01:16:05.754 --> 01:16:10.295]  I mean, how can you... I mean, look, you send the troops in and then you give them experimental vaccines.
[01:16:10.335 --> 01:16:11.876]  You make them breathe DU.
[01:16:11.936 --> 01:16:12.656]  Aren't you against that?
[01:16:13.556 --> 01:16:16.817]  Well, I'm of course against harm coming to our troops, but...
[01:16:18.027 --> 01:16:19.669]  I want to see more of the bad guys dead.
[01:16:20.389 --> 01:16:21.090]  It's that simple.
[01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:25.915]  Now look, if you want to talk about how this political correctness is ruining our country, we can talk about it.
[01:16:26.296 --> 01:16:36.707]  If you want to, you know, look, Abu Grabass, as I called it, or whatever prison, a guy with a pillowcase over his head, look, they're cutting off people's heads and shooting care workers in the face.
[01:16:39.233 --> 01:16:42.335]  I think we have to let our guys, our Marines, go crazy.
[01:16:42.575 --> 01:16:43.455]  We have to unleash them.
[01:16:44.336 --> 01:16:46.076]  You know, they have booby-trapped bodies and other things.
[01:16:46.256 --> 01:16:46.757]  Mankell!
[01:16:46.937 --> 01:16:47.377]  Mankell!
[01:16:47.577 --> 01:16:49.138]  And shot a body and everybody's upset.
[01:16:49.318 --> 01:16:49.978]  It's war.
[01:16:50.719 --> 01:16:55.661]  If you'd been up for three days and you thought one of these maniacs had a bomb underneath them, you'd shoot them too.
[01:16:56.041 --> 01:17:01.244]  So this Dianne Feinstein politically correct way of fighting war, oh my God, people have died.
[01:17:01.384 --> 01:17:04.085]  Yeah, I think we ought to just level it.
[01:17:04.605 --> 01:17:05.085]  Mankell!
[01:17:05.626 --> 01:17:05.986]  Mankell!
[01:17:06.773 --> 01:17:09.734]  Shifting gears into another subject, this is something that we agree on.
[01:17:10.454 --> 01:17:14.695]  Tell them about how not just women are groped at the airport in Chicago, you've been groped.
[01:17:15.275 --> 01:17:20.637]  Yeah, you know, I feel, and I am not hypersensitive.
[01:17:20.677 --> 01:17:21.697]  I really don't think I am.
[01:17:24.398 --> 01:17:27.218]  You know, I get it, and I put up a lot of things, and I grin and bear it.
[01:17:27.939 --> 01:17:29.939]  There are certain things that you have to go through in life.
[01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:32.800]  But I feel as though I was...
[01:17:33.801 --> 01:17:35.082]  I'm sexually harassed.
[01:17:35.362 --> 01:17:36.823]  There was a man that spoke no English.
[01:17:37.123 --> 01:17:40.645]  He spoke some sort of Arabic language.
[01:17:40.925 --> 01:17:42.005]  With a turban on his head.
[01:17:42.045 --> 01:17:42.626]  With a turban.
[01:17:42.926 --> 01:17:45.907]  The people doing the airport checking have turbans.
[01:17:45.947 --> 01:17:48.929]  He lingered on a very personal area.
[01:17:49.569 --> 01:17:50.730]  And I think it went well beyond.
[01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:53.131]  And then you've got the two-finger swipe thing that they do with the women.
[01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:55.221]  And it's vile.
[01:17:55.521 --> 01:17:59.564]  This is training us how to be humiliated.
[01:17:59.904 --> 01:18:00.264]  Of course.
[01:18:00.404 --> 01:18:06.808]  Yeah, this is step-by-step until we're microchipped and marching off to the gulag saying what happened.
[01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:12.151]  In Chicago, they have a plan to put on every pole cameras.
[01:18:12.251 --> 01:18:13.292]  Face-scanning cameras.
[01:18:13.372 --> 01:18:13.892]  Sure, sure.
[01:18:14.053 --> 01:18:21.237]  And this great OnStar system that we have in our cars and our cell phones, we're tracked all the time.
[01:18:21.929 --> 01:18:30.816]  They also promised that they would never use any of this stuff, but what they're going to start doing is pulling these computers in our cars to give us tickets after the fact to jack up our insurance.
[01:18:30.876 --> 01:18:31.256]  I hear you.
[01:18:31.276 --> 01:18:34.698]  Mancow, stay there with us for one more segment, okay?
[01:18:35.059 --> 01:18:35.239]  Great.
[01:18:35.259 --> 01:18:45.647]  All right, we'll be right back with Mancow Muller at mancow.com, and then later we'll get into the new revelations about Arnold and the police state and just so much more.
[01:18:46.247 --> 01:18:47.728]  Absolutely jam-packed broadcast.
[01:18:48.128 --> 01:18:49.710]  I'm Alex Jones, presentplanet.tv.
[01:18:53.757 --> 01:18:57.120]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:18:57.380 --> 01:18:57.701]  Why?
[01:18:58.041 --> 01:19:00.663]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[01:19:00.743 --> 01:19:05.688]  Cardivite drops in capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[01:19:05.828 --> 01:19:15.536]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle tissue, mitigating heart rhythm abnormalities, and improving oxygen and blood flow in the heart.
[01:19:15.716 --> 01:19:19.980]  Right now, as a special for GCN listeners, you'll get a four-month supply for only $99 plus shipping.
[01:19:20.981 --> 01:19:21.381]  We're good to go.
[01:19:42.401 --> 01:19:43.602]  Don't let heart disease beat you.
[01:19:43.622 --> 01:19:46.104]  Beat the odds and do your body right with Cardivite.
[01:19:54.611 --> 01:19:56.832]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:19:57.252 --> 01:20:01.633]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:20:01.893 --> 01:20:07.695]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:20:07.915 --> 01:20:11.996]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:20:12.276 --> 01:20:17.898]  However, they have become the elite group more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[01:20:18.018 --> 01:20:20.638]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:20:22.739 --> 01:20:26.640]  By mid-1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:29.061]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[01:20:29.401 --> 01:20:31.702]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[01:20:32.082 --> 01:20:35.703]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[01:20:36.183 --> 01:20:42.385]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[01:20:42.825 --> 01:20:43.806]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:20:44.146 --> 01:20:44.506]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:44.526 --> 01:20:44.766]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.107 --> 01:20:56.369]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:20:56.429 --> 01:21:00.591]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:21:00.851 --> 01:21:03.652]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:21:03.832 --> 01:21:06.234]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:21:06.434 --> 01:21:15.078]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:21:15.258 --> 01:21:16.599]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:21:16.799 --> 01:21:20.981]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:21:21.281 --> 01:21:26.087]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[01:21:42.165 --> 01:21:45.008]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:21:45.048 --> 01:21:45.849]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:55.662]  You and your family members getting enough minerals on the daily diet?
[01:21:56.043 --> 01:21:58.544]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[01:21:58.765 --> 01:22:05.830]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[01:22:06.030 --> 01:22:11.614]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard is more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[01:22:11.934 --> 01:22:19.760]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:20.620]  We're good to go.
[01:22:50.460 --> 01:23:06.592]  All right, Mancow Muller is on with us, my friends.
[01:23:08.133 --> 01:23:15.459]  And Mancow, continuing our little discussion here, during the break I asked you, what do you think Arnold Schwarzenegger, you said, ask me on the air.
[01:23:15.539 --> 01:23:16.119]  Well, tell us.
[01:23:16.479 --> 01:23:17.360]  Before we get to that.
[01:23:18.345 --> 01:23:20.966]  You know, we're talking about a lot of things, but we're not giving answers.
[01:23:21.787 --> 01:23:23.648]  Do I have time to give a quick statement?
[01:23:24.168 --> 01:23:24.748]  Of course you do.
[01:23:24.768 --> 01:23:31.732]  I talk about my wife being molested and how we sit and allow our women to be manhandled by low-paid thugs.
[01:23:32.372 --> 01:23:35.374]  And it's the same mentality of the laughing Romans as they kicked Christ.
[01:23:35.894 --> 01:23:38.916]  It's the same mentality of the guards in the Nazi concentration camps.
[01:23:39.576 --> 01:23:42.738]  And what you people need to do, if you want to know how to make a difference, complain,
[01:23:43.897 --> 01:23:46.979]  I love when... Take your computer out.
[01:23:47.019 --> 01:23:47.740]  Take your belt off.
[01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:48.520]  Take your shoes off.
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:49.541]  Jump up and down on one foot.
[01:23:49.581 --> 01:23:50.242]  Touch your nose.
[01:23:51.002 --> 01:23:53.344]  And simply go as slow as you can.
[01:23:54.064 --> 01:23:57.266]  And if you don't like the way you're treated, raise hell.
[01:23:58.527 --> 01:24:00.709]  The worst that will happen is you'll get a first class ticket.
[01:24:01.629 --> 01:24:03.010]  And the airlines are hurting.
[01:24:03.431 --> 01:24:04.551]  They will take note of this.
[01:24:04.591 --> 01:24:05.072]  Complain.
[01:24:05.492 --> 01:24:10.916]  The Target stores have refused to allow Salvation Army bell ringers this year.
[01:24:11.316 --> 01:24:12.497]  Can you imagine...
[01:24:13.144 --> 01:24:15.826]  A Christmas without the Salvation... That's a great organization.
[01:24:16.046 --> 01:24:20.049]  That Salvation Army... Yeah, I just expect to hear that dinging bell as part of the festive.
[01:24:20.109 --> 01:24:20.770]  That's right.
[01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:30.437]  So Target wants to make a lot of money off what is the high holiday in this country and the birth of... I mean, you know what the reason for the season is, but yet they don't want to allow the Salvation Army.
[01:24:31.137 --> 01:24:38.183]  And by the way, they're doing that not because they're trying to sidestep it now and say, oh, it's because we don't have anybody out there soliciting.
[01:24:38.243 --> 01:24:41.165]  No, it's because the Salvation Army is conservative.
[01:24:41.704 --> 01:24:43.565]  Well, it's... It's just like the Boy Scouts.
[01:24:44.165 --> 01:24:45.866]  Say the name out loud in your head, folks.
[01:24:46.046 --> 01:24:46.907]  Salvation Army.
[01:24:47.187 --> 01:24:49.168]  And then figure out why they're not going to be allowed.
[01:24:49.728 --> 01:24:52.790]  So what you can do... You know, my family shops at Target.
[01:24:52.830 --> 01:24:56.552]  What we have done is we've gone and we've said, Look, we're not going to come in your store.
[01:24:57.813 --> 01:24:59.213]  Yeah, we've done the same thing.
[01:24:59.253 --> 01:25:02.475]  We don't go to Slave Mart and then it's all the same stuff at Target.
[01:25:02.495 --> 01:25:03.416]  My wife likes Target.
[01:25:03.436 --> 01:25:04.916]  We're not going to Target over it.
[01:25:05.157 --> 01:25:06.477]  This will make a difference.
[01:25:06.737 --> 01:25:07.518]  This will make a difference.
[01:25:07.598 --> 01:25:07.798]  All right.
[01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:09.821]  You asked me about Schwarzenegger.
[01:25:09.861 --> 01:25:11.022]  Your caller earlier was wrong.
[01:25:11.062 --> 01:25:11.682]  I've been listening.
[01:25:12.382 --> 01:25:14.964]  Arnold Schwarzenegger means black plow boy.
[01:25:15.404 --> 01:25:16.624]  That's a direct translation.
[01:25:17.485 --> 01:25:18.365]  Is he the Antichrist?
[01:25:18.465 --> 01:25:19.846]  Is he the precursor of the Antichrist?
[01:25:20.046 --> 01:25:20.486]  I don't know.
[01:25:21.027 --> 01:25:23.288]  I do find it interesting that there are signs around him.
[01:25:23.348 --> 01:25:31.452]  One of the signs of the apocalypse, there is a pink locust that they've never seen before.
[01:25:31.972 --> 01:25:33.773]  This swarm of locusts that started with...
[01:25:35.655 --> 01:25:39.678]  With the funeral of Arafat in Egypt, and now it has spread to Israel.
[01:25:39.979 --> 01:25:41.260]  This is biblical stuff.
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:42.421]  It is interesting.
[01:25:42.661 --> 01:25:47.265]  And for those who are watching the signs, it's a busy job right now.
[01:25:48.266 --> 01:25:50.488]  I do find it interesting that, you know, they always do this.
[01:25:50.988 --> 01:25:54.591]  These people masquerade as liberals or as conservatives to get elected.
[01:25:54.671 --> 01:25:58.314]  They masquerade as having family values, and then they get into office and do the opposite.
[01:25:58.975 --> 01:25:59.875]  It's what Kerry would have done.
[01:25:59.916 --> 01:26:00.676]  It's what Clinton did.
[01:26:01.177 --> 01:26:02.658]  And boy, you know, Schwarzenegger...
[01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:07.501]  Was standing at the Republican Convention, but my God, is he liberal!
[01:26:07.981 --> 01:26:08.841]  Well, let me just say this.
[01:26:09.061 --> 01:26:19.084]  I was there, Mankow, and I watched these conservatives crying, worshipping him, and pro-gun control, pro-open borders, pro-cloning, stem cell.
[01:26:20.044 --> 01:26:23.305]  All of this, it goes on and on and on, and then all these quotes in U.S.
[01:26:23.345 --> 01:26:24.245]  News & World Report.
[01:26:24.545 --> 01:26:26.246]  You know, forget when he's 30, how about when he's 45?
[01:26:28.567 --> 01:26:29.647]  I want to be a dictator.
[01:26:29.687 --> 01:26:31.248]  I want to rule over small people.
[01:26:31.268 --> 01:26:32.288]  You deserve to be ruled.
[01:26:32.748 --> 01:26:33.989]  Anybody talking like that.
[01:26:34.269 --> 01:26:38.151]  We need leaders who want to lead, not dominate and control.
[01:26:38.211 --> 01:26:41.252]  I mean, it's a narcissistic, control freak sport.
[01:26:41.352 --> 01:26:42.212]  He was the king of it.
[01:26:42.432 --> 01:26:43.873]  I mean, I've researched bodybuilding.
[01:26:44.708 --> 01:26:45.969]  Really a slimy thing.
[01:26:45.989 --> 01:26:52.312]  And, you know, Arnold's got people at his Arnold Classic drop, falling over and be carried off stage, dying days after they're at it.
[01:26:52.612 --> 01:26:54.673]  I mean, number one, it's a dirty sport to begin with.
[01:26:54.693 --> 01:26:56.974]  And there's so much, man, Cal.
[01:26:58.138 --> 01:27:04.464]  There's no denying that Predator is a great movie, and Terminator, and I think people get caught up in the fact that this is a Hollywood star.
[01:27:04.865 --> 01:27:07.967]  Alex, I do think that America is beginning to wake up.
[01:27:08.368 --> 01:27:15.394]  I think Ben Affleck, who with his cap teeth and his fake tan is looking more like a talk show host than an actor, these people's movies are failing.
[01:27:15.795 --> 01:27:20.599]  America's turning away from the Susan Sure is Dumb, and that Janine got awful ho in all of these people.
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:22.361]  Look at what happened...
[01:27:23.872 --> 01:27:25.534]  You know, with Tom Daschle and these people.
[01:27:26.034 --> 01:27:26.995]  They are failing.
[01:27:27.115 --> 01:27:28.096]  Alex, don't give up.
[01:27:29.257 --> 01:27:32.099]  Because I think America is waking up to what these people are.
[01:27:32.399 --> 01:27:36.302]  And I think America will wake up if Schwarzenegger is a bad guy.
[01:27:36.763 --> 01:27:37.563]  I think the jury's still out.
[01:27:37.583 --> 01:27:38.504]  I like a lot of what he says.
[01:27:38.544 --> 01:27:39.265]  But you're right.
[01:27:39.305 --> 01:27:40.065]  He goes very liberal.
[01:27:40.345 --> 01:27:41.266]  I'm not for open borders.
[01:27:41.306 --> 01:27:42.327]  I do believe we should have guns.
[01:27:42.988 --> 01:27:44.449]  America, I think, will wake up.
[01:27:44.489 --> 01:27:47.311]  I think we saw divine intervention recently.
[01:27:48.872 --> 01:27:49.853]  Look, I voted libertarian.
[01:27:49.873 --> 01:27:51.054]  I think things can always be better.
[01:27:51.114 --> 01:27:52.355]  I always vote on the side of freedom.
[01:27:52.856 --> 01:27:53.016]  But...
[01:27:53.877 --> 01:27:59.443]  There are occasions when America and the American public steps up to the plate and they do the right thing.
[01:27:59.683 --> 01:28:03.628]  Listen, Alex, I believe all of us will live to see California voting.
[01:28:04.116 --> 01:28:06.539]  To be part of Mexico voting to get out of the United States.
[01:28:06.559 --> 01:28:07.280]  Oh, yeah, that's coming.
[01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:09.662]  Last thing, man, Cal, I want to thank you for coming on today.
[01:28:09.682 --> 01:28:12.826]  Tell folks about your radio show, how people hear it.
[01:28:13.206 --> 01:28:16.710]  Well, it's, you know, it's, look, it's one of many radio shows.
[01:28:16.810 --> 01:28:17.891]  I think we do a unique thing.
[01:28:18.251 --> 01:28:19.593]  My whole thing is not about me.
[01:28:20.073 --> 01:28:22.276]  It is about giving the American people their voice.
[01:28:22.776 --> 01:28:25.960]  And voices like Alex's, for example, folks, it's a rare thing.
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:29.964]  Because the corporations are buying... Man, Cal, tell us about your flagship in Chicago.
[01:28:30.144 --> 01:28:30.824]  It's G101.
[01:28:30.844 --> 01:28:34.728]  But look, the corporations are buying every radio station and shutting up anyone that's unique.
[01:28:35.089 --> 01:28:36.810]  So you've got to support unique shows.
[01:28:37.091 --> 01:28:38.172]  Man, Cal, thanks for joining us.
[01:28:38.192 --> 01:28:38.672]  Take care.
[01:28:38.992 --> 01:28:39.413]  We'll be back.
[01:28:44.037 --> 01:28:44.978]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.439 --> 01:28:47.040]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:50.644]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.767 --> 01:28:56.249]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:28:56.449 --> 01:29:03.796]  Jerry Guidetti from the ARC Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:29:04.116 --> 01:29:08.520]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the ARC Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:29:08.801 --> 01:29:11.063]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste.
[01:29:11.343 --> 01:29:12.164]  We're good to go.
[01:29:32.363 --> 01:29:32.543]  That's 800-255-1912.
[01:29:32.563 --> 01:29:35.625]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[01:29:35.645 --> 01:29:36.405]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:29:55.629 --> 01:30:06.894]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:30:07.114 --> 01:30:10.596]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[01:30:10.776 --> 01:30:11.296]  We're good to go.
[01:30:32.006 --> 01:30:38.933]  The Berkey light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[01:30:39.154 --> 01:30:44.419]  Get the Berkey light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:30:55.658 --> 01:31:01.122]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:01.563 --> 01:31:05.806]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:31:06.026 --> 01:31:13.072]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:13.452 --> 01:31:19.557]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:19.697 --> 01:31:20.898]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:21.098 --> 01:31:23.439]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:31:38.027 --> 01:31:41.172]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[01:31:41.192 --> 01:31:41.272]  866-885-6625.
[01:31:41.292 --> 01:31:41.412]  866-885-6625.
[01:31:41.532 --> 01:31:42.434]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:31:42.454 --> 01:31:42.694]  Call today.
[01:32:08.379 --> 01:32:13.600]  Sheldon, Dave, Kyle, Daryl, Steve, everybody, your calls are coming up.
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:17.361]  Why am I talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger so much?
[01:32:17.381 --> 01:32:20.282]  Well, obviously, I've started AmericansAgainstArnold.com.
[01:32:20.302 --> 01:32:25.303]  Americans Against Arnold is the organization.
[01:32:25.323 --> 01:32:28.364]  The website is ArnoldExposed.com.
[01:32:29.064 --> 01:32:30.184]  ArnoldExposed.com.
[01:32:31.064 --> 01:32:32.305]  And I'm seeking donations.
[01:32:32.605 --> 01:32:38.671]  Last time I did this was to build a memorial church, because we stood there and watched them die and did nothing for the Branch Davidians that died.
[01:32:38.871 --> 01:32:39.211]  Did that in 99.
[01:32:39.271 --> 01:32:45.436]  You can go there to Mount Carmel and see it, and they have their little church service there, and you'll see if they're a cult or not.
[01:32:45.817 --> 01:32:56.626]  I'm not a Davidian, don't agree with their views, but it's certainly not a cult now, just some kind of interesting, well, kind of weird people who were, and almost everybody they knew, slaughtered.
[01:32:58.402 --> 01:32:59.223]  And then they weren't helped.
[01:32:59.543 --> 01:33:00.704]  And then they were found not guilty.
[01:33:00.744 --> 01:33:03.506]  And the judge put them in prison and said, I don't care if they're not guilty.
[01:33:03.546 --> 01:33:04.427]  I say they go to prison.
[01:33:04.928 --> 01:33:05.708]  That's on the record.
[01:33:05.768 --> 01:33:08.050]  And then he said, I'm not going to let them have a jury for their civil trial.
[01:33:08.110 --> 01:33:13.975]  So I, with the help of you, the listeners, built them a memorial church that seats about 400 people.
[01:33:14.235 --> 01:33:14.776]  Two stories.
[01:33:16.297 --> 01:33:16.918]  And we did it for $120,000.
[01:33:17.258 --> 01:33:19.600]  Well, we don't need that much money this time.
[01:33:20.681 --> 01:33:21.702]  We need a lot less than that.
[01:33:21.762 --> 01:33:22.182]  Really about $20,000.
[01:33:22.222 --> 01:33:22.863]  To run ads in Sacramento.
[01:33:26.812 --> 01:33:30.454]  To run ads in Los Angeles, to run ads in Austin, Texas.
[01:33:30.514 --> 01:33:32.295]  And I'm trying to produce radio ads right now.
[01:33:32.315 --> 01:33:33.136]  I'm trying to do a TV ad.
[01:33:33.176 --> 01:33:35.077]  We're going to have a contest where you get $2,000.
[01:33:35.137 --> 01:33:36.978]  We'll do this.
[01:33:36.998 --> 01:33:39.579]  It'll be a second wave of ads we run in the new year.
[01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:43.882]  January 1st will be the prize date when we choose the winner.
[01:33:43.902 --> 01:33:46.644]  We'll probably choose it a week or two before, but that'll be when you get paid.
[01:33:46.664 --> 01:33:49.265]  We're going to cut the contest off, say, December 20th.
[01:33:49.325 --> 01:33:52.027]  And $2,000 for the best 30 or 60-second TV ad.
[01:33:57.819 --> 01:34:01.400]  And, of course, $1,000 for the best radio ad.
[01:34:03.140 --> 01:34:05.541]  But I'm going to put together some real simple ads right now.
[01:34:06.261 --> 01:34:08.941]  But when you do this, I mean, it's all got to be cleared for copyright.
[01:34:08.981 --> 01:34:10.842]  It's all got to be prepared right.
[01:34:11.322 --> 01:34:12.582]  I'm doing so many interviews.
[01:34:12.802 --> 01:34:17.503]  Literally, folks, I will be talking, I counted it up, nine and a half hours today.
[01:34:19.283 --> 01:34:25.205]  And then at 11 o'clock at night, I'm going to go meet with an editor and look at the work he's done on the film we're making for about an hour.
[01:34:25.225 --> 01:34:27.425]  I went to bed at
[01:34:28.261 --> 01:34:28.681]  3 a.m.
[01:34:28.741 --> 01:34:29.182]  last night.
[01:34:29.202 --> 01:34:31.123]  I'm not talking about how great I am.
[01:34:31.583 --> 01:34:35.725]  I said I'd try to run radio and TV ads by this week, but it takes longer than that to get the media body to run it.
[01:34:35.745 --> 01:34:38.107]  So I'm going to give myself a few weeks, but you'll see them.
[01:34:38.167 --> 01:34:39.067]  You'll see them on the sites.
[01:34:39.107 --> 01:34:39.587]  You'll see them.
[01:34:39.927 --> 01:34:40.728]  You'll hear them here.
[01:34:40.908 --> 01:34:42.729]  You'll see them on TV in select cities.
[01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:46.091]  Then we'll run another second wave of ads next year.
[01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:47.821]  We're good to go.
[01:35:15.632 --> 01:35:16.172]  He'll make it.
[01:35:17.152 --> 01:35:22.654]  We'll post the ads and the radio ads as long as everything in them is documented.
[01:35:23.454 --> 01:35:24.234]  They're on the site.
[01:35:24.274 --> 01:35:25.334]  Millions will be able to see it.
[01:35:27.035 --> 01:35:30.016]  Perhaps we'll have voting by... We can do polls.
[01:35:30.056 --> 01:35:31.296]  Maybe we'll have a poll on there.
[01:35:32.336 --> 01:35:34.557]  We've got scientific ones where you can only vote once.
[01:35:35.077 --> 01:35:35.857]  Somewhat scientific.
[01:35:35.897 --> 01:35:38.558]  And then maybe perhaps... Perhaps maybe...
[01:35:41.178 --> 01:35:48.041]  I don't know, half the vote will be from you, and then a quarter of the vote from me, and a quarter of the vote from somebody else we pick.
[01:35:48.722 --> 01:35:51.543]  So it'll be not just me saying who's going to win.
[01:35:51.923 --> 01:35:54.364]  I don't know, but please join in on that, be part of that.
[01:35:54.745 --> 01:36:01.468]  We've got loaded phone lines, and we're going to be going to all your calls here in a few minutes, but I kind of got into this in the last hour.
[01:36:01.708 --> 01:36:05.750]  I didn't want to, but the listeners all called in about Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger.
[01:36:06.858 --> 01:36:17.860]  And for the average person like Man Cal, average talk show host out there, it's, yeah, you know, he's a big liberal, gun control and open borders and all this, but, you know, I don't know why he's that bad.
[01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:18.720]  Maybe he is bad.
[01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:19.120]  Who knows?
[01:36:20.941 --> 01:36:23.121]  That's because they haven't done the research on this guy.
[01:36:25.421 --> 01:36:31.302]  When you do do the research, it's a bottomless pit of admitted stuff.
[01:36:31.402 --> 01:36:33.343]  I mean, people who were in business with him.
[01:36:33.883 --> 01:36:34.583]  His friends.
[01:36:36.562 --> 01:36:37.882]  His own statements to U.S.
[01:36:37.902 --> 01:36:42.203]  News & World Report and Associated Press and on TV shows.
[01:36:43.604 --> 01:36:45.984]  In many cases, we've got him saying it.
[01:36:51.045 --> 01:36:53.586]  And really, in a nutshell, this is my problem with Arnold.
[01:36:56.466 --> 01:37:04.308]  Number one, the elite allow him to operate under another set of rules than any other politician.
[01:37:05.183 --> 01:37:07.785]  Imagine somebody else posing for gay porno mags.
[01:37:09.486 --> 01:37:12.547]  Somebody else who openly says he admires Hitler.
[01:37:12.708 --> 01:37:16.670]  Somebody who says he wants to be a dictator and dreams of being a dictator and worshipped at Nuremberg.
[01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:19.872]  Somebody who admittedly has groped and harassed all these women.
[01:37:21.052 --> 01:37:26.756]  Somebody who admittedly took steroids that changes your brain chemistry and can cause psychotic breaks and delusions of grandeur.
[01:37:27.216 --> 01:37:29.177]  Somebody who openly smokes pot on television.
[01:37:29.197 --> 01:37:30.398]  I have the video of that and he admits it.
[01:37:32.165 --> 01:37:36.669]  Somebody who constantly has quotes about how he wants to control and dominate people.
[01:37:37.609 --> 01:37:39.150]  There's literally scores of these.
[01:37:42.153 --> 01:37:50.819]  Somebody who in education of a bodybuilder says that he looks down on Jesus Christ and people that follow Christ as a bunch of weak losers and how he looks to himself.
[01:37:52.301 --> 01:37:53.261]  I mean, it's sick stuff.
[01:37:55.783 --> 01:37:59.766]  And a lot of the liberals like him because he's pro-abortion, pro-gun control, pro-open borders.
[01:38:00.127 --> 01:38:01.808]  And the conservatives, some of them like him.
[01:38:02.472 --> 01:38:03.973]  Because they just don't know about all that.
[01:38:04.053 --> 01:38:06.314]  You know, it's him against Davis, so he must be good.
[01:38:06.334 --> 01:38:09.335]  See, they're going to pit him against Hillary, so, oh, see, he must be good.
[01:38:11.056 --> 01:38:12.496]  That's how you're going to see this shift happen.
[01:38:12.616 --> 01:38:13.417]  They're going to set it up.
[01:38:13.597 --> 01:38:15.617]  They're going to pull some shenanigans.
[01:38:15.737 --> 01:38:16.258]  You watch.
[01:38:17.038 --> 01:38:17.538]  I know this.
[01:38:17.558 --> 01:38:20.820]  This series is a heart attack unless we expose it and fight it.
[01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:29.163]  And, you know, I'm a voracious reader, so I've seen him smoke pot and him talk about being a dictator and
[01:38:30.623 --> 01:38:35.185]  Talk about how I dreamed of being a dictator and remember forever like Jesus or Hitler or whatever.
[01:38:35.205 --> 01:38:36.626]  You know, that's in videos and stuff.
[01:38:39.647 --> 01:38:40.767]  But I wasn't too worried about it.
[01:38:40.907 --> 01:38:41.387]  Ah, Arnold.
[01:38:41.407 --> 01:38:43.188]  You know, I'd even read a few books he'd written.
[01:38:43.368 --> 01:38:44.409]  I'd watch his movies.
[01:38:44.669 --> 01:38:46.530]  Ah, you know, I quit going to see him a decade ago.
[01:38:46.570 --> 01:38:47.450]  I thought they were cheesy.
[01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:49.831]  You know, when I was a teenager growing up, I thought they were interesting.
[01:38:51.773 --> 01:38:52.554]  Nothing against the guy.
[01:38:52.894 --> 01:39:04.744]  And then he was getting ready to run for governor, and I knew about Bohemian Grove, and I started reading the statements he'd made, and Karl Rove, and the Rothschilds behind him, and meeting with the Enron chief, and the middle of it, and to come up with a plan to have a recall.
[01:39:04.764 --> 01:39:15.093]  This is before anybody even knew about it, because actually, great avid for all the evil he is, that Arnold is as well, all the same policies, was actually going after Enron and suing them.
[01:39:16.095 --> 01:39:18.516]  Then Arnold comes out and, you did bad with the energy.
[01:39:18.556 --> 01:39:19.197]  You're behind it.
[01:39:19.217 --> 01:39:19.777]  I'll get you.
[01:39:19.977 --> 01:39:29.361]  So the guy meeting with Michael Milken, the junk bond dealer, and the head of Enron, Ken Lay, at this meeting, and the Enron documents are public now, and they schemed this stuff at the meeting.
[01:39:30.962 --> 01:39:38.026]  And so I have to watch him as the savior against the energy crisis, punishing the Gray Davis who was fighting it, literally.
[01:39:39.166 --> 01:39:40.927]  Because he knew it was his political neck if he didn't.
[01:39:41.787 --> 01:39:43.549]  Enron's sucking $9 billion out of there.
[01:39:43.989 --> 01:39:45.511]  So it was just thing after thing.
[01:39:45.531 --> 01:39:47.472]  And then, well, his dad's an SS officer.
[01:39:47.512 --> 01:39:48.173]  He's a foreigner.
[01:39:48.233 --> 01:39:53.898]  And he said over and over again in scores of radio and TV and print interviews, I've got them all right here in front of me.
[01:39:53.938 --> 01:40:01.665]  I've now got a thing about a foot tall of mainstream news articles saying I want them in Article 2, Clause 5 of the Constitution.
[01:40:01.685 --> 01:40:02.746]  I think I still run for president.
[01:40:03.487 --> 01:40:04.588]  It's no secret in Hollywood.
[01:40:04.628 --> 01:40:05.469]  It's all he talks about.
[01:40:07.575 --> 01:40:09.596]  Imagine, an Austrian, a foreigner, is our president.
[01:40:09.896 --> 01:40:11.317]  Polls show 80% are against him.
[01:40:11.597 --> 01:40:17.461]  But not when they get into an election and play him off against somebody like Hillary.
[01:40:17.821 --> 01:40:18.922]  Then that's how he'll get in.
[01:40:19.642 --> 01:40:20.843]  Or any other Democrat, for that matter.
[01:40:21.623 --> 01:40:32.710]  Because he has this archetypal, Beowulf, Herculean perception, kind of Joseph Campbell perception, and this stuff is real, folks.
[01:40:33.672 --> 01:40:50.825]  This archetypal image in our minds that they've superimposed on us of this guy, that he's this invincible savior who defeats the devil, he defeats big monsters, he's in The Running Man, he's in Total Recall, all these allusions to elections, 1993 film where he's the demolition man.
[01:40:52.366 --> 01:40:54.948]  In Demolition Man, Sylvester Stallone, they talk about him being president.
[01:40:55.388 --> 01:40:57.970]  In fact, that clip's at prisonplanet.tv down in the...
[01:41:00.405 --> 01:41:02.986]  Commentary section, or maybe it's in the multimedia section.
[01:41:03.006 --> 01:41:06.728]  You may have to click on the archive a few days ago to find that from last week.
[01:41:06.748 --> 01:41:08.750]  In fact, if you could find that for me, John, that'd be great.
[01:41:08.770 --> 01:41:10.410]  You might ever have that of a meaning to.
[01:41:12.211 --> 01:41:14.753]  And so all this is going on, all this is happening.
[01:41:15.193 --> 01:41:17.154]  And he marries in with Maria Shriver.
[01:41:17.234 --> 01:41:24.618]  When his father, the SS officer, police chief dies, his mother marries the top Nazi, who is also the head of the parliament.
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:29.562]  He says, I don't care about the Nazi stuff.
[01:41:29.662 --> 01:41:30.002]  I love him.
[01:41:30.022 --> 01:41:30.682]  Maria loves him.
[01:41:31.002 --> 01:41:31.743]  Kurt does too.
[01:41:31.903 --> 01:41:32.803]  You know all that stuff.
[01:41:33.083 --> 01:41:37.005]  Then he goes in 1999 and is photographed with him and engaged in government business in Austria.
[01:41:37.246 --> 01:41:39.166]  He hasn't given up his Austrian citizenship.
[01:41:40.827 --> 01:41:42.868]  Which means he can't get a lot of security clearances.
[01:41:42.948 --> 01:41:44.069]  Basic security clearances.
[01:41:44.169 --> 01:41:45.730]  You couldn't if you have dual citizenship.
[01:41:45.870 --> 01:41:46.650]  You have to drop it.
[01:41:46.670 --> 01:41:50.092]  I think we have one agreement with England where you don't have to.
[01:41:50.872 --> 01:41:51.633]  For certain things.
[01:41:53.134 --> 01:41:54.194]  All of this going on.
[01:41:54.474 --> 01:41:55.675]  And then, folks...
[01:41:57.441 --> 01:41:59.001]  I found these quotes, U.S.
[01:41:59.041 --> 01:42:02.802]  News & World Report, 1990, when he was 44 years old.
[01:42:03.282 --> 01:42:06.803]  People say, well, he said he wanted to be a dictator and rule over little people when he was 25, 30, 35.
[01:42:08.843 --> 01:42:10.144]  You know, he's not like that now.
[01:42:10.164 --> 01:42:12.344]  1990, folks, 44 years old.
[01:42:12.384 --> 01:42:14.284]  I think you've set who you are by then.
[01:42:14.484 --> 01:42:16.005]  And he openly says this stuff.
[01:42:17.545 --> 01:42:18.125]  That's the thing.
[01:42:18.465 --> 01:42:20.706]  He openly comes out and says all of this.
[01:42:20.726 --> 01:42:21.826]  Imagine what he really thinks.
[01:42:22.606 --> 01:42:24.446]  People need somebody to watch over them.
[01:42:24.466 --> 01:42:25.867]  95% of the people...
[01:42:28.425 --> 01:42:31.726]  In the world, need to be told what to do and how to behave.
[01:42:32.847 --> 01:42:34.988]  People need someone to watch over them.
[01:42:35.008 --> 01:42:39.950]  95% of people in the world need to be told what to do and how to behave.
[01:42:41.450 --> 01:42:43.571]  My relationship to power and authority is this.
[01:42:44.132 --> 01:42:45.092]  I'm all for it.
[01:42:46.392 --> 01:42:47.693]  I look down on little people.
[01:42:49.054 --> 01:42:50.034]  These are quotes.
[01:42:50.254 --> 01:42:50.894]  1990 profile in U.S.
[01:42:50.934 --> 01:42:57.357]  News and World Report noted Arnold's intensity and predicted that he would someday run for office.
[01:42:58.695 --> 01:43:08.717]  After noting a long-standing desire for political clout, they asked Arnold, and the article quotes him as saying, My relationship to power and authority is that I'm all for it.
[01:43:08.737 --> 01:43:16.178]  I mean, imagine if George Bush or John Kerry was going... Imagine George Bush.
[01:43:16.298 --> 01:43:19.279]  People need somebody to watch over them.
[01:43:19.299 --> 01:43:22.260]  95% of the people in the world need to be told what to do and how to behave.
[01:43:22.420 --> 01:43:22.900]  Imagine that.
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:24.280]  Well, I guess he did say...
[01:43:25.566 --> 01:43:30.387]  This would be a heck of a lot easier if it was a dictator, as long as I'm a dictatorship, as long as I'm a dictator.
[01:43:30.407 --> 01:43:31.468]  I mean, Bill Clinton said that too.
[01:43:31.488 --> 01:43:33.168]  Maybe that's what you've got to say now.
[01:43:34.048 --> 01:43:34.989]  And people love that.
[01:43:36.189 --> 01:43:38.870]  But, folks, that's nothing.
[01:43:40.290 --> 01:43:40.890]  That's nothing.
[01:43:41.390 --> 01:43:43.311]  I found an article out of the Observer.
[01:43:46.192 --> 01:43:47.152]  Posted in the Guardian.
[01:43:48.573 --> 01:43:50.073]  And it's going up as we speak.
[01:43:51.517 --> 01:43:52.837]  At ArnoldExposed.com.
[01:43:52.917 --> 01:43:53.818]  Big update today.
[01:43:53.858 --> 01:43:55.518]  The Morgenthaler Jones interview.
[01:43:55.918 --> 01:43:56.939]  A bunch of articles, L.A.
[01:43:56.959 --> 01:44:00.260]  Times saying he's probably going to run for president over the weekend.
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:04.881]  The San Antonio Express News, an article I'm in about Arnold coming to Texas for campaign.
[01:44:06.182 --> 01:44:11.283]  Raising campaign money, but then he says he doesn't know if he's going to run yet, but he's already campaigning.
[01:44:14.144 --> 01:44:17.425]  This is out of an interview, out of the Observer.
[01:44:17.685 --> 01:44:18.485]  Very respected.
[01:44:19.406 --> 01:44:20.246]  George Butler...
[01:44:21.559 --> 01:44:28.165]  The guy that did Pumping Iron with Arnold, who just sold the rights to it to him a couple years ago, admitted friends with him.
[01:44:28.606 --> 01:44:29.987]  George Butler is bragging about it.
[01:44:31.008 --> 01:44:34.371]  George Butler saw it, and so did Charles Gaines, who saw the star power.
[01:44:34.631 --> 01:44:41.017]  But they didn't see it the way Joe Wiener did, or as the bodybuilding fans did, or even as the bodybuilders themselves did.
[01:44:41.517 --> 01:44:42.338]  Now listen to this.
[01:44:43.079 --> 01:44:45.301]  This is what Charles Gaines told the Observer.
[01:44:46.585 --> 01:44:49.546]  Schwarzenegger, unlike anyone else... Now, get ready for this.
[01:44:49.666 --> 01:44:58.411]  Schwarzenegger, unlike anyone else in all of bodybuilding, or in anything else at all, Arnold told Butler and Gaines about a recurring dream that he had.
[01:44:58.471 --> 01:45:02.552]  In the dream, he was king of all the earth, and everyone looked up to him.
[01:45:04.093 --> 01:45:07.395]  In the recurring dream, he was king of all the earth, and everyone looked up to him.
[01:45:08.135 --> 01:45:14.498]  Butler recalled that Arnold was also attending night school and had drawn up something he called the Master Plan.
[01:45:16.548 --> 01:45:20.050]  It was a kind of a mix of Nietzsche and Soviet five-year plan.
[01:45:20.751 --> 01:45:21.511]  Nietzsche, Soviet.
[01:45:21.892 --> 01:45:23.072]  Again, the Beastman, folks.
[01:45:23.933 --> 01:45:27.575]  Only it was more of a 50-year plan, Butler recalled.
[01:45:28.076 --> 01:45:29.256]  He wanted to be very big.
[01:45:29.296 --> 01:45:37.842]  My own particular view is that he had in his mind to be President of the United States, King of the Universe, probably if there are extraterrestrials out there, he'd like to rule them as well.
[01:45:39.023 --> 01:45:43.506]  Arnold had laid out the master plan for Butler and Gaines,
[01:45:44.725 --> 01:45:49.651]  I will come to America, which is the country for me, once I will become the greatest bodybuilder.
[01:45:50.452 --> 01:45:52.595]  With his accent, he said, bodybuilder.
[01:45:54.097 --> 01:45:57.040]  While I am doing this, I will learn perfect English and educate myself.
[01:45:57.421 --> 01:45:59.964]  But the only with those things I need to know.
[01:45:59.984 --> 01:46:02.888]  I will get a college degree.
[01:46:03.979 --> 01:46:04.899]  Then a business degree.
[01:46:05.399 --> 01:46:07.080]  I will invest in real estate and make big money.
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:08.380]  I will go into the movies.
[01:46:08.420 --> 01:46:12.421]  By the time I'm 30, I will have started my first movie and I will be a millionaire.
[01:46:12.821 --> 01:46:14.581]  I will marry a beautiful and successful wife.
[01:46:15.901 --> 01:46:19.002]  By the time I'm 32, I will have been invited to the White House.
[01:46:20.242 --> 01:46:25.563]  To Arnold, the master plan was as clear and tangible as the running, reoccurring dream of being king of the earth.
[01:46:26.164 --> 01:46:33.105]  To Butler, it would have been absurd, but for one thing, Schwarzenegger had already begun to accomplish the goals he had succeeded in Hollywood via their muscle.
[01:46:34.813 --> 01:46:38.436]  It was a very unlikely one, but then everything about bodybuilding was unlikely.
[01:46:41.319 --> 01:46:46.063]  And he goes on to say he believes that he'd be President of the United States one day.
[01:46:47.424 --> 01:46:49.045]  Folks, again, I want to go to your calls.
[01:46:49.065 --> 01:46:52.969]  I don't want to spend all day on this, but there's even more here.
[01:46:54.270 --> 01:46:55.631]  It gets even worse.
[01:46:57.413 --> 01:47:01.296]  So a Nietzschean-slash-Soviet five-year plan
[01:47:04.645 --> 01:47:08.729]  And they videotaped this, and then Arnold's bought all the extra footage, by the way.
[01:47:09.029 --> 01:47:10.551]  He just bought rights to it two years ago.
[01:47:12.593 --> 01:47:18.418]  And they had book proposals, and they did make a book out of it, and this is in all the notes and the recordings, and Arnold's bought all that, too.
[01:47:19.339 --> 01:47:20.621]  But here they are, telling you.
[01:47:22.903 --> 01:47:23.844]  King of the world.
[01:47:24.084 --> 01:47:26.306]  You don't want people being the dog catcher.
[01:47:26.326 --> 01:47:29.129]  You know, the cop that gets out of control wants to be king of the world.
[01:47:31.047 --> 01:47:34.469]  The megalomaniacal narcissism, I mean, that's synonymous with bodybuilding.
[01:47:34.909 --> 01:47:43.134]  You know, these guys, I was reading descriptions of it, they get in there in front of the posing mirrors, and they're all in there, and whoever's biggest makes everybody else move out of the way.
[01:47:43.174 --> 01:47:47.256]  I mean, it's like dog-eat-dog, just bizarre craziness.
[01:47:48.136 --> 01:47:55.480]  A bunch of narcissists who've created this weird world for them to carry out their sick mental processes.
[01:47:58.002 --> 01:47:58.182]  So,
[01:47:59.364 --> 01:48:01.966]  My relationship to power and authority is that I'm all for it.
[01:48:02.586 --> 01:48:04.507]  People need someone to watch over them.
[01:48:04.527 --> 01:48:07.249]  95% of people in the world need to be told what to do and how to behave.
[01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:10.251]  But you don't need to, Arnold.
[01:48:10.271 --> 01:48:15.134]  You can go out and grope wherever you want, make whatever sick comments you want, admit illegal drug use all you want.
[01:48:17.555 --> 01:48:20.077]  You can pay people large sums of money.
[01:48:20.097 --> 01:48:24.640]  You know, these Jewish organizations will then say you're great and you can still run off and vacation with all time.
[01:48:26.001 --> 01:48:27.982]  Who helped hunt down American soldiers?
[01:48:30.936 --> 01:48:37.818]  And then your buddies, your minions, John and Ken, who helped push for you, helped start the recall, helped have the Arnold rallies.
[01:48:38.098 --> 01:48:39.198]  That's even been in the mainstream news.
[01:48:39.659 --> 01:48:41.239]  They come out and say things like this.
[01:48:41.279 --> 01:48:42.719]  Get that clip ready again for folks.
[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:49.361]  Bring up ball time hunting down Americans and how Arnold still supports him and defends him.
[01:48:49.381 --> 01:48:50.782]  He was with him a month or so ago.
[01:48:50.822 --> 01:48:51.362]  It was in the news.
[01:48:52.102 --> 01:48:53.603]  And this is what they have to say to it.
[01:48:53.883 --> 01:48:54.523]  You got that clip?
[01:48:57.664 --> 01:48:58.404]  John, you got that clip?
[01:48:59.815 --> 01:49:01.096]  No, I want to play the other one first.
[01:49:02.238 --> 01:49:02.818]  Yeah, you got that?
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:05.361]  Go ahead and roll it.
[01:49:05.401 --> 01:49:05.941]  Listen to this.
[01:49:07.363 --> 01:49:08.064]  What does that mean?
[01:49:08.544 --> 01:49:12.308]  You know, Adolf Hitler was Time Magazine Man of the Year in 1933.
[01:49:13.409 --> 01:49:16.813]  So a lot of sickos back then thought Adolf Hitler was okay.
[01:49:17.324 --> 01:49:19.166]  So you really believe Schwarzenegger is another Hitler?
[01:49:19.786 --> 01:49:21.768]  You think he's going to be a great creator?
[01:49:21.788 --> 01:49:22.909]  He dreams of being a dictator.
[01:49:22.949 --> 01:49:24.110]  You think he's going to be a dictator?
[01:49:24.130 --> 01:49:26.211]  He goes to campaigns for Kurt Voltheim.
[01:49:26.272 --> 01:49:28.453]  I've got to hunt him down and kill the American soldiers.
[01:49:28.493 --> 01:49:30.255]  It's funny, isn't it?
[01:49:30.275 --> 01:49:32.196]  Killing the American soldiers is funny.
[01:49:32.457 --> 01:49:32.877]  Oh, it is.
[01:49:32.937 --> 01:49:33.377]  It's a riot.
[01:49:33.397 --> 01:49:34.538]  It's the funniest thing I've ever heard of.
[01:49:34.558 --> 01:49:35.139]  It's real funny.
[01:49:35.159 --> 01:49:39.843]  You can hear the whole interview, but that's not out of context.
[01:49:41.544 --> 01:49:42.125]  We'll come back.
[01:49:42.465 --> 01:49:43.446]  Start going to your calls.
[01:49:43.686 --> 01:49:44.487]  Bunch of other news.
[01:49:45.385 --> 01:49:46.586]  On the police state, big brother.
[01:49:46.606 --> 01:49:48.347]  I want to get more into satellite cracking boxes.
[01:49:48.787 --> 01:49:50.048]  Give you some specifics.
[01:49:51.949 --> 01:49:52.549]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:52.569 --> 01:49:53.110]  Stay with us.
[01:49:54.831 --> 01:50:02.215]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:50:02.475 --> 01:50:07.258]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:50:07.438 --> 01:50:13.082]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:50:13.322 --> 01:50:17.844]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:50:18.065 --> 01:50:25.228]  The casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:50:25.248 --> 01:50:29.791]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.951 --> 01:50:32.452]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:50:32.692 --> 01:50:39.396]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:50:39.696 --> 01:50:39.956]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:53.723 --> 01:50:59.987]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:51:00.108 --> 01:51:06.272]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:51:06.552 --> 01:51:14.998]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:51:15.238 --> 01:51:22.263]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:51:22.563 --> 01:51:27.386]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:51:27.586 --> 01:51:33.010]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:36.432]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:51:36.753 --> 01:51:44.718]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:44.758 --> 01:51:45.358]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.

[01:53:06.926 --> 01:53:09.247]  When the levee breaks, you have no place to stay.
[01:53:09.267 --> 01:53:15.368]  When the new old order comes rushing in to an even greater level, you're not going to like it.
[01:53:19.629 --> 01:53:27.791]  My friends, before we go back to your calls, I have made 11 films, the 11th film, American Dictators, documenting the stage election of 2004.
[01:53:27.871 --> 01:53:28.231]  Is it out?

[01:53:38.249 --> 01:53:38.769]  Great idea.
[01:53:40.050 --> 01:53:43.331]  Got another package deal of four 9-11 videos and a book.
[01:53:43.351 --> 01:53:43.331]  $59.95.

[01:53:44.691 --> 01:53:45.751]  I got 9-11 The Road to Tyranny.

[01:53:46.011 --> 01:53:47.212]  Almost three hours long.
[01:53:47.232 --> 01:53:48.912]  $24.95 each additional copy. $5.95.
[01:53:56.741 --> 01:53:57.902]  Get a bunch, give them as gifts.

[01:54:46.413 --> 01:54:47.614]  Sheldon in Arizona.
[01:54:47.674 --> 01:54:48.714]  Sheldon, welcome.
[01:54:50.316 --> 01:54:51.176]  Hello, Alex.
[01:54:51.637 --> 01:54:57.502]  I'm calling in to talk about how they want to turn the schools into psychotropic medication laboratories.
[01:54:58.883 --> 01:54:59.203]  Yes, sir.
[01:54:59.903 --> 01:55:04.607]  Well, the tally for the vote over the weekend was 344 to 51.
[01:55:08.157 --> 01:55:09.678]  I don't know if you've heard about that yet.
[01:55:09.798 --> 01:55:12.759]  Well, to show my ignorance, I was so busy doing interviews and everything else.
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:15.221]  Are you saying it passed?
[01:55:15.761 --> 01:55:19.343]  Yeah, 344 were for it and 51 against it.
[01:55:20.763 --> 01:55:22.964]  Well, you know, that just shows what an idiot I am.
[01:55:23.165 --> 01:55:28.427]  I know that the National ID card section didn't pass, correct?
[01:55:29.808 --> 01:55:29.888]  Um...
[01:55:30.563 --> 01:55:33.085]  Well, I don't know about that part.
[01:55:33.445 --> 01:55:38.368]  Yeah, well, I have an article saying it didn't, but of course the psychological screening did.
[01:55:39.409 --> 01:55:40.650]  Man, heaven help us.
[01:55:40.730 --> 01:55:43.232]  I've got to... Where did you see that or read that?
[01:55:43.832 --> 01:55:46.614]  I contacted Senator John Kyle's office.
[01:55:46.674 --> 01:55:48.695]  Yeah, there's really no articles out there about it.
[01:55:48.715 --> 01:55:52.218]  No, but this is quite peculiar.
[01:55:52.278 --> 01:55:59.583]  My friend up in Wisconsin, he tried to get on a radio talk, local talk radio show up there, and...
[01:56:00.239 --> 01:56:04.923]  He said, the radio show host said he couldn't talk about it or he'd lose his job.
[01:56:06.344 --> 01:56:07.265]  Well, it's big money.
[01:56:08.226 --> 01:56:09.988]  15% of the kids are already on these drugs.
[01:56:10.008 --> 01:56:10.929]  15%, folks.
[01:56:11.949 --> 01:56:14.872]  They say it'll at least put half of them on drugs.
[01:56:15.072 --> 01:56:22.359]  This is their own documents that were made public four or five months ago out of, what was it, Pennsylvania and Ohio.
[01:56:23.155 --> 01:56:27.579]  Where they got the documents on the plan, some of their own employees went public, because of moral reasons.
[01:56:27.919 --> 01:56:29.961]  And they're going to force your children on these.
[01:56:30.302 --> 01:56:32.564]  We're talking about tens of billions a year.
[01:56:33.264 --> 01:56:35.126]  And I have no doubt they said don't talk about it.
[01:56:35.146 --> 01:56:36.107]  This is big industry.
[01:56:36.127 --> 01:56:38.189]  This is the Sovietization of America.
[01:56:38.249 --> 01:56:43.213]  Once half the kids are on these drugs, once half the adults are on them, I'm sure we'll all vote for Arnold.
[01:56:44.374 --> 01:56:46.977]  I'm sure we'll all love having satellite tracker boxes in our cars.
[01:56:47.317 --> 01:56:48.358]  So you called your senator.
[01:56:49.944 --> 01:56:55.589]  This is coming from Senator Kyle's office, and I believe, oh, it's the other one.
[01:56:57.050 --> 01:56:59.792]  Norman, or Ron Paul's office, the vote tally.
[01:57:01.293 --> 01:57:02.974]  Well, let me call my webmaster.
[01:57:02.994 --> 01:57:05.536]  In fact, I'll just, this is so important, I'll call her right now on air.
[01:57:05.556 --> 01:57:06.177]  I'll call my wife.
[01:57:06.978 --> 01:57:08.018]  It's probably already been posted.
[01:57:08.038 --> 01:57:12.022]  I left while she was updating, and I know Paul Watson's off working on something today.
[01:57:12.042 --> 01:57:15.044]  The Senate voted for it, too, and it was passed by the Senate 65-30.
[01:57:16.969 --> 01:57:18.050]  Well, hey, hold on just a second.
[01:57:18.310 --> 01:57:20.031]  Hey, hon, I'm calling you live on air.
[01:57:20.131 --> 01:57:26.074]  Listen, a caller's saying they passed that psychological screening bill in the House and Senate by a huge majority.
[01:57:26.094 --> 01:57:27.435]  Can you confirm that and post it?
[01:57:27.455 --> 01:57:31.837]  Well, that's just absolutely bombshell if it's true.
[01:57:32.038 --> 01:57:33.098]  I'll call you back and find out.
[01:57:34.339 --> 01:57:34.939]  Call me back?
[01:57:35.239 --> 01:57:35.539]  Yeah.
[01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:36.680]  All right, thank you.
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:38.121]  Hold on just a second, hon.
[01:57:38.401 --> 01:57:38.981]  Thank you, sir.
[01:57:39.142 --> 01:57:40.122]  I appreciate your call.
[01:57:40.402 --> 01:57:41.123]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:41.183 --> 01:57:41.563]  Third hour.
[01:57:50.292 --> 01:57:50.933]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.594 --> 01:57:52.655]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.375 --> 01:57:54.477]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.117 --> 01:57:55.978]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.699 --> 01:57:57.600]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.620 --> 01:58:01.924]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.445 --> 01:58:06.589]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.891 --> 01:58:12.615]  Remember, we have a government, whether it's Republicans or Democrats...
[01:58:16.115 --> 01:58:19.856]  They told us there was no Patriot Act II six months after it was introduced.
[01:58:21.657 --> 01:58:40.101]  Well, now they've openly said that they're going to bring an emergency session back in sometime over the holidays in December to try to pass the new freedom initiative, to try to pass the 9-11 bill, to try to pass a bunch of stuff they couldn't get through.
[01:58:40.121 --> 01:58:41.922]  But then a caller called in and said he talked to his senator.
[01:58:42.589 --> 01:58:51.116]  And they said that the mental health screening, the Sovietization, did pass, but then another caller said that no, the overall bill did, but not those subsections.
[01:58:51.696 --> 01:58:52.677]  I don't know what the truth is.
[01:58:52.697 --> 01:58:54.338]  We looked for it this morning, couldn't find it.
[01:58:54.358 --> 01:59:02.584]  If you've got a mainstream news article or legislative report for this, we'll try to find it.
[01:59:03.024 --> 01:59:06.287]  Before this hour is over, we'll have that answer for you.
[01:59:08.348 --> 01:59:10.769]  Plus some new big Schwarzenegger revelations.
[01:59:11.470 --> 01:59:13.391]  That's coming up at the end of the show for those that missed them.
[01:59:13.951 --> 01:59:16.613]  And we'll get into these five hunters killed in Wisconsin woods.
[01:59:16.633 --> 01:59:17.693]  The media going nuts with that.
[01:59:18.073 --> 01:59:20.295]  Doctors Group fights prescription reporting bill.
[01:59:20.655 --> 01:59:21.515]  It's total big brother.
[01:59:21.595 --> 01:59:23.636]  Kerry says that bin Laden came to Bush's aid.
[01:59:23.936 --> 01:59:25.237]  Well, even Karl Rove says that.
[01:59:25.938 --> 01:59:26.938]  We'll get into that.
[01:59:26.998 --> 01:59:28.759]  Plus Bush wants total open borders.
[01:59:28.799 --> 01:59:32.701]  Renewing that drive yet again this weekend when he was visiting Latin America.
[01:59:34.442 --> 01:59:37.504]  Right now, though, let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[01:59:38.368 --> 01:59:40.349]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave in Michigan.
[01:59:40.369 --> 01:59:41.029]  Dave, go ahead.
[01:59:41.169 --> 01:59:43.449]  Well, it's a coincidence you mentioned them five hunters.
[01:59:44.190 --> 01:59:45.690]  That's what I found about an hour ago.
[01:59:45.710 --> 01:59:47.430]  Okay, well, you're on the air.
[01:59:47.690 --> 01:59:49.371]  Well, I was watching the thing there.
[01:59:49.391 --> 02:00:00.114]  The guy went and was hiding in a tree stand on somebody else's property, and the one guy that was in the hunting lodge on the property came up to the tree stand and said, Hey, get off our property.
[02:00:00.194 --> 02:00:01.134]  So the guy shot him.
[02:00:02.048 --> 02:00:04.969]  We come back wounded with seven other guys.
[02:00:05.309 --> 02:00:07.309]  Well, that sounds like something... And he killed five of them!
[02:00:07.509 --> 02:00:11.170]  And killed five of them with an assault rifle is what the story is.
[02:00:11.210 --> 02:00:13.870]  Yeah, when you yell, your phone distorts where I can't hear a word.
[02:00:15.571 --> 02:00:18.711]  Well, I mean, the guy is a foreigner, of course.
[02:00:20.311 --> 02:00:25.672]  And, you know, I mean, I don't mean to be mean, folks, but these foreigners, they can't drive cars on average.
[02:00:26.693 --> 02:00:28.213]  They just, I mean, it's a joke.
[02:00:29.341 --> 02:00:32.183]  And, I mean, you never would have heard of something like that.
[02:00:32.243 --> 02:00:34.104]  And they got this guy up in somebody's land.
[02:00:34.124 --> 02:00:34.904]  They said, get out of here.
[02:00:34.945 --> 02:00:35.545]  So he kills him.
[02:00:36.265 --> 02:00:39.147]  Well, not only that, the first thing they mentioned was that he had an assault rifle.
[02:00:39.167 --> 02:00:41.669]  And that'll be the first bill that'll go through the lame duck session.
[02:00:41.689 --> 02:00:44.951]  Just to reinstitute the assault rifle ban.
[02:00:45.531 --> 02:00:48.873]  And they're going to broaden it and make it so he can't even own a centerfire rifle.
[02:00:50.094 --> 02:00:52.295]  Yeah, we'll probably find out he was a mental patient.
[02:00:52.315 --> 02:00:55.437]  He'll probably be in some government psychiatric ward and...
[02:00:57.714 --> 02:00:58.094]  I don't know.
[02:00:58.134 --> 02:00:58.855]  It just never ends.
[02:00:58.875 --> 02:00:59.355]  There's no end to it.
[02:00:59.916 --> 02:01:09.563]  But, you know, Mancow there, I don't know what impression he got of the Alexander the Great movie, but you couldn't possibly make a movie weird enough to sum up Alexander's life.
[02:01:09.583 --> 02:01:15.167]  Because not only was he a homosexual, he also liked eunuchs and probably slept with his mother.
[02:01:17.609 --> 02:01:21.312]  Well, yeah, I'm not a big supporter of Alexander the Great.
[02:01:21.652 --> 02:01:23.974]  It's not really my namesake, but...
[02:01:25.271 --> 02:01:34.019]  That's my name, so... One thing I could say for Alexander in his favor is that he was wounded in battle 37 times, and every single wound was to the front.
[02:01:35.561 --> 02:01:41.046]  And whenever they attacked the city, it was a foot race between him and his companions that he would be the first one over the wall.
[02:01:42.007 --> 02:01:44.089]  And that's not what we have running our government.
[02:01:46.812 --> 02:01:48.454]  Yeah, a lot of that was propaganda, though.
[02:01:48.474 --> 02:01:54.379]  He would, like, leave a battle scene and have his forges create giant swords 50 feet long and lay them on the ground.
[02:01:54.399 --> 02:01:57.822]  He'd scare people that a god had come down to help him.
[02:01:57.842 --> 02:01:59.163]  A lot of that was propaganda.
[02:01:59.183 --> 02:02:02.586]  He thought he was Dionysus or Hercules or Melkar.
[02:02:03.567 --> 02:02:07.030]  And he was trying to make people think that he was the incarnation of God on Earth.
[02:02:07.566 --> 02:02:08.707]  Yeah, you know your history.
[02:02:08.747 --> 02:02:10.228]  And now they're doing that with Arnold again.
[02:02:10.268 --> 02:02:12.189]  Arnold Schwarzenegger with his propaganda.
[02:02:12.209 --> 02:02:14.251]  You know, this invincible savior.
[02:02:15.192 --> 02:02:15.792]  And it's nothing.
[02:02:16.252 --> 02:02:18.434]  He's a rotten little husk of a creature.
[02:02:19.094 --> 02:02:25.219]  Well, you know, I saw a statue in Munich of Alexander that was a copy of a statue by Euphonor.
[02:02:25.739 --> 02:02:28.041]  And Alexander looked more like Rudolf Nureyev.
[02:02:28.061 --> 02:02:30.182]  He was a short little wiry guy.
[02:02:32.464 --> 02:02:34.105]  I appreciate your call.
[02:02:34.205 --> 02:02:35.066]  Very interesting call.
[02:02:35.106 --> 02:02:36.367]  Call back any time, Dave.
[02:02:37.245 --> 02:02:44.031]  Kyle and Daryl and everybody else, your calls are up next, 1-800-259-9231, presentplanet.tv.
[02:02:45.893 --> 02:02:50.216]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.417 --> 02:02:54.840]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.981 --> 02:02:59.384]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:59.424 --> 02:03:00.726]  The New World Order.
[02:03:02.527 --> 02:03:06.748]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.808 --> 02:03:13.751]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.871 --> 02:03:15.932]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:16.232 --> 02:03:26.596]  Homeland security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.876 --> 02:03:28.677]  If you want to understand what the new world order really
[02:03:28.737 --> 02:03:29.318]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:29.438 --> 02:03:30.779]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:03:46.192 --> 02:03:55.260]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:03:55.520 --> 02:04:06.750]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:04:07.090 --> 02:04:12.795]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:04:13.035 --> 02:04:13.535]  We're good to go.
[02:04:37.513 --> 02:04:37.633]  803-4438.
[02:04:37.673 --> 02:04:43.036]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:04:43.056 --> 02:04:50.019]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glass, who is a pharmacist from Marks Puzzle Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[02:04:50.139 --> 02:04:50.519]  Hi, Alan.
[02:04:50.539 --> 02:04:51.360]  Welcome to the program.
[02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:52.120]  Thank you, Marvin.
[02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:55.662]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[02:04:55.842 --> 02:04:56.362]  Is that true?
[02:04:56.602 --> 02:04:57.202]  Yes, Marvin.
[02:04:57.242 --> 02:04:57.582]  It's true.
[02:04:57.602 --> 02:05:00.604]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[02:05:00.644 --> 02:05:00.884]  prices.
[02:05:01.104 --> 02:05:03.145]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[02:05:03.165 --> 02:05:03.965]  They're very common.
[02:05:04.046 --> 02:05:07.227]  Those common drugs you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[02:05:07.267 --> 02:05:07.547]  price.
[02:05:07.787 --> 02:05:08.968]  Now what about Tamoxifen?
[02:05:09.008 --> 02:05:11.409]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[02:05:11.609 --> 02:05:15.411]  Tamoxifen, you can see a 75% savings against the regular U.S.
[02:05:15.431 --> 02:05:15.731]  price.
[02:05:16.072 --> 02:05:18.473]  Now are these brand name products made by the same company?
[02:05:18.733 --> 02:05:20.754]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[02:05:20.774 --> 02:05:22.815]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.
[02:05:23.075 --> 02:05:27.997]  So to save money on prescription drugs in Canada, call the toll-free number for your information package.
[02:05:28.257 --> 02:05:30.198]  To find out more, call toll-free 1-800-840-0686.
[02:05:30.218 --> 02:05:30.638]  That's 1-800-840-0686.
[02:05:30.658 --> 02:05:31.959]  Or go on the web at www.kenshipdrugs.com.
[02:05:31.979 --> 02:05:33.499]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:33.859 --> 02:05:35.300]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:57.082 --> 02:05:59.962]  1-800-259-9231, the number to join us.
[02:06:03.624 --> 02:06:11.786]  Reportedly, the 9-11 National ID Card Total Information Awareness Network Patriot Act II legislation did not pass over the weekend.
[02:06:14.047 --> 02:06:23.290]  And we've got callers calling in saying that the National Health Screening for Psychological Testing did pass, didn't pass.
[02:06:23.390 --> 02:06:24.470]  We'll track it down for you.
[02:06:25.791 --> 02:06:27.692]  Lawmakers say intelligence bill not dead.
[02:06:27.752 --> 02:06:29.733]  An overhaul of the nation's intelligence agencies.
[02:06:29.773 --> 02:06:30.914]  It's an overhaul, folks, yeah.
[02:06:31.414 --> 02:06:37.578]  May still pass the year despite the collapse of a compromise bill Congress congressional leaders said Sunday.
[02:06:39.619 --> 02:06:41.480]  You know, here's the problem semantically.
[02:06:42.121 --> 02:06:43.501]  Just with the words they use.
[02:06:44.142 --> 02:06:45.223]  It's a reform.
[02:06:45.283 --> 02:06:46.463]  It's an overhaul.
[02:06:46.783 --> 02:06:54.348]  You think of an overhaul, getting a new engine in your car, getting the brake lines changed, getting new brake pads, getting everything greased, getting a new interior.
[02:06:55.399 --> 02:06:58.421]  Getting a new paint job, getting new tires.
[02:07:00.362 --> 02:07:02.223]  You think of it as something good, an overhaul.
[02:07:02.864 --> 02:07:19.834]  No, it is a, if they would have said the radical change, the centralization of power, the increase in intelligence agencies' power, unbridled, to secretly arrest anyone they wish, and secretly execute you, is not dead.
[02:07:22.751 --> 02:07:24.272]  But people semantically read this.
[02:07:24.433 --> 02:07:26.234]  Oh, let me read this on the newspaper this morning.
[02:07:26.835 --> 02:07:27.695]  Associated Press.
[02:07:28.256 --> 02:07:36.203]  On overhaul, the nation's intelligence agencies may still pass this year, despite the collapse of a compromise bill congressional leaders said Sunday.
[02:07:38.645 --> 02:07:40.426]  So nothing about why people are against it.
[02:07:41.287 --> 02:07:42.728]  Nothing about the details of it.
[02:07:42.788 --> 02:07:46.111]  It's just, oh man, they're not going to be able to keep us safe.
[02:07:46.411 --> 02:07:48.253]  I wish they could get stuff done up there.
[02:07:49.967 --> 02:07:53.169]  I still think there's a pretty good chance we're going to get intelligence reform.
[02:07:53.209 --> 02:07:57.791]  Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell, Republican Kentucky, said on ABC this week.
[02:07:59.112 --> 02:08:09.737]  He said Congress will likely return December 6th in an effort to pass the bill, which would create a powerful position to oversee the CIA and several other non-military spy agencies.
[02:08:09.777 --> 02:08:16.421]  The bill was comprised, that was endorsed by the House and Senate negotiators.
[02:08:16.461 --> 02:08:18.802]  The White House said they bypassed the September 11th commission.
[02:08:19.580 --> 02:08:22.221]  Congress was to have finished its session on Saturday.
[02:08:24.061 --> 02:08:36.544]  Asked on ABC's channel, similar comments were made, and also asked on NBC's Meet the Press, quote, if the bill had a chance this year, Senator John McCain, Republican Arizona said, I think so.
[02:08:37.244 --> 02:08:40.925]  I never believed that we wouldn't pass it once we had the conference report signed.
[02:08:41.585 --> 02:08:44.206]  Other lawmakers were less optimistic.
[02:08:45.606 --> 02:08:46.927]  See, it's optimistic.
[02:08:47.447 --> 02:08:48.467]  Are they optimistic?
[02:08:48.507 --> 02:08:50.568]  Well, some are less optimistic.
[02:08:51.008 --> 02:08:52.709]  Can we get this goody through?
[02:08:54.090 --> 02:08:55.170]  Well, it's not a goody.
[02:08:55.230 --> 02:08:56.311]  It's not something you want.
[02:08:56.771 --> 02:09:00.433]  Meanwhile, again, Bush renews open border drive.
[02:09:00.453 --> 02:09:07.236]  And he called for it while on a trip to Latin America for Free Trade Area of the Americas.
[02:09:07.316 --> 02:09:14.599]  Bush called for a guest worker program that is total, blanket, complete, absolute good.
[02:09:15.359 --> 02:09:15.859]  Amnesty.
[02:09:18.281 --> 02:09:21.863]  I mean, what do you say about the psychopath out killing people in deer stands?
[02:09:23.464 --> 02:09:25.385]  People tell him to get off their property, he kills them.
[02:09:26.586 --> 02:09:33.750]  Some foreigner, probably a mental patient, all the more reason we have guns to defend ourselves from lunatics like this.
[02:09:34.510 --> 02:09:37.452]  By the way, they've banned hunting completely in England now.
[02:09:40.594 --> 02:09:43.776]  They call it cruel and unusual to hunt foxes with hounds.
[02:09:46.547 --> 02:09:48.468]  I watched some BBC news online.
[02:09:48.488 --> 02:09:57.734]  They had these people who five minutes earlier were cramming hamburgers and pizzas and other types of dishes that have meat on them into their mouths.
[02:09:57.794 --> 02:10:04.418]  And they'll tell you how mean it is, these same groups, to have chickens or hogs and slaughter them.
[02:10:05.298 --> 02:10:06.319]  And they'll sit there and eat it.
[02:10:06.359 --> 02:10:09.301]  I mean, that's how disconnected the reality of these people are.
[02:10:10.602 --> 02:10:14.004]  Foxes are like cockroaches in England.
[02:10:15.177 --> 02:10:16.858]  They have big litters every year.
[02:10:17.799 --> 02:10:20.981]  They're all over the place digging holes that people break their legs in.
[02:10:21.261 --> 02:10:26.225]  They sneak in, kill your chickens, kill your ducks, kill your geese, attack other animals.
[02:10:28.286 --> 02:10:29.327]  They're all over the place.
[02:10:29.367 --> 02:10:31.228]  Paul Watson lives in the middle of the city.
[02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:39.174]  And he's got foxes howling, making their little noises all night, running around all over the place in his yard and everywhere else.
[02:10:41.676 --> 02:10:43.657]  Well, the rural people have said, that's it.
[02:10:43.797 --> 02:10:45.497]  You can't have military training on our land.
[02:10:45.517 --> 02:10:46.877]  You can't have power lines on our land.
[02:10:47.258 --> 02:10:49.718]  You can't come into the irrigation ditches and clean them out on our land.
[02:10:50.378 --> 02:10:58.621]  And thousands of landowners and the economy that is supported by fox hunting, they're saying, we're going to ignore the law when it goes into effect.
[02:10:58.641 --> 02:11:00.001]  We don't care what you say.
[02:11:02.061 --> 02:11:04.802]  They tried to ban all hunting in France.
[02:11:04.822 --> 02:11:11.304]  The only way you can still have a gun in France is if you're a registered member with a license as part of a hunting lodge.
[02:11:12.757 --> 02:11:15.898]  You can hunt deer and hog, you know, wallabore, stuff like that.
[02:11:16.458 --> 02:11:21.300]  The point is, folks, that's a way to kill the rural community and bring in total control.
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:24.661]  And I want to hand it to the French for saying no.
[02:11:25.021 --> 02:11:32.304]  And the poor British have had all their forms of hunting with guns taken, and now it's down to their hounds.
[02:11:33.424 --> 02:11:35.165]  Well, that's what dogs do normally.
[02:11:35.865 --> 02:11:38.426]  And it's normal and natural, and it's not cruel.
[02:11:39.238 --> 02:11:41.819]  To take your dogs out and have them hunt something down.
[02:11:42.079 --> 02:11:43.599]  That's what human beings do.
[02:11:44.439 --> 02:11:54.722]  You'd rather eat some chicken so fat, genetically engineered, that it breaks its legs and just wallows around in its own excrement for a month, and then you take that dirty thing.
[02:11:55.983 --> 02:11:58.943]  We buy range-fed organic chicken.
[02:11:58.963 --> 02:12:00.744]  It costs five times more, literally.
[02:12:00.764 --> 02:12:02.544]  It tastes completely different.
[02:12:04.065 --> 02:12:05.785]  Organic milk costs twice as much.
[02:12:05.805 --> 02:12:08.106]  It tastes completely different.
[02:12:10.513 --> 02:12:16.076]  I mean, that's not psychological.
[02:12:16.116 --> 02:12:17.216]  That's not a placebo.
[02:12:19.677 --> 02:12:20.878]  That's not my opinion.
[02:12:20.938 --> 02:12:22.679]  I mean, I'm just like, oh, this is organic, isn't it?
[02:12:24.500 --> 02:12:25.080]  You can just tell.
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:28.642]  The eggs that are organic are big and orange and taste good.
[02:12:29.002 --> 02:12:36.205]  And the eggs I grew up eating, the little yellow puny things that come out of these factories, I eat one of those now and I can't even eat it.
[02:12:36.225 --> 02:12:37.906]  It's like filtered water.
[02:12:37.966 --> 02:12:38.707]  So delicious.
[02:12:38.747 --> 02:12:39.407]  So good.
[02:12:40.163 --> 02:12:44.724]  Growing up, I remember I'd drink a bunch of water and I'd get a headache and it tasted bad in Dallas.
[02:12:44.744 --> 02:12:48.925]  I had to learn all this stuff on my own.
[02:12:51.166 --> 02:12:52.546]  It's the same thing.
[02:12:53.586 --> 02:12:55.587]  There's a big movement here to ban all types of hunting.
[02:12:56.087 --> 02:13:02.889]  If I want to go out to Fredericksburg, where my uncle lives, or if I want to go out to East Texas, where we've got family land, and I want to shoot a deer at 600 yards...
[02:13:04.335 --> 02:13:08.416]  That I want to go gut it and take it into a processor and have sausage made out of it that I'm going to eat?
[02:13:08.557 --> 02:13:09.977]  That's my business, you freaks!
[02:13:12.978 --> 02:13:16.439]  And yes, it isn't enjoyable causing an animal pain.
[02:13:16.459 --> 02:13:18.400]  When I shoot them, they always die instantly.
[02:13:19.060 --> 02:13:20.081]  Maybe run ten feet.
[02:13:22.862 --> 02:13:30.164]  Not bragging, I can put a .308 round to the size of a quarter at 200 yards every time and got pretty good last year.
[02:13:30.204 --> 02:13:31.405]  Got back into some shooting again.
[02:13:31.465 --> 02:13:31.965]  Got back to
[02:13:32.893 --> 02:13:41.555]  Near the levels I had decades ago, and I was able to, you know, I shot this little, young, probably, I don't know, not even a year old deer.
[02:13:41.575 --> 02:13:42.535]  It just has better meat.
[02:13:42.575 --> 02:13:43.935]  It wasn't a baby.
[02:13:43.995 --> 02:13:45.056]  It wasn't shooting Bambi.
[02:13:46.516 --> 02:13:47.736]  600 yards away facing me.
[02:13:47.756 --> 02:13:48.696]  I wanted some sport, too.
[02:13:48.736 --> 02:13:50.497]  I didn't shoot it when it was sideways to me.
[02:13:50.957 --> 02:13:51.457]  I shot it.
[02:13:51.537 --> 02:13:52.337]  My uncle was right there with me.
[02:13:52.357 --> 02:13:53.777]  We were drinking coffee on the front porch.
[02:13:54.417 --> 02:13:59.298]  600 yards away, back of the fence line, and right up on the end of his property where he lives.
[02:14:00.359 --> 02:14:01.939]  And there's the deer.
[02:14:03.703 --> 02:14:05.184]  And I waited until it turned around and faced me.
[02:14:05.224 --> 02:14:06.564]  And I said, I'm going to shoot it right in the chest.
[02:14:06.584 --> 02:14:07.805]  And I shot it and fell right over.
[02:14:07.845 --> 02:14:11.586]  And we drove over and threw it in the back of the truck until it got processed.
[02:14:12.347 --> 02:14:13.787]  Am I some type of evil sicko?
[02:14:14.127 --> 02:14:16.228]  You'll sit there cramming a hamburger in your face all day?
[02:14:16.408 --> 02:14:19.189]  Let me tell you how that cow was killed.
[02:14:21.110 --> 02:14:23.071]  They loaded that cow up on a truck.
[02:14:23.531 --> 02:14:29.894]  And they took it into a slaughterhouse where for a day, generally, it sits outside in a lot.
[02:14:31.391 --> 02:14:31.911]  We're good to go.
[02:14:59.807 --> 02:15:04.948]  And then they take the thing while it's still flopping, and they've got these machines that start ripping it into pieces.
[02:15:06.368 --> 02:15:16.990]  Then they scrape up all the giblets and goop off the ground and scrape it up and send it off for you to eat in your fast food, and then the rest of it gets sent off to your supermarket after it hangs there for a few weeks.
[02:15:19.591 --> 02:15:21.051]  But you love that beef, don't you?
[02:15:22.391 --> 02:15:27.152]  I don't eat it now, folks, unless it is a very expensive, range-fed, black Angus beef.
[02:15:27.879 --> 02:15:35.622]  That a little bitty steak I might eat one every two weeks or something, about the only red meat I eat now, it tastes completely different.
[02:15:37.483 --> 02:15:45.766]  It tastes like beef I ate where it was a cow my family would kill themselves and slaughter themselves and put in the deep freeze for the year.
[02:15:46.707 --> 02:15:49.648]  Frozen, real fresh beef tastes better than...
[02:15:50.689 --> 02:15:53.911]  And the stuff that's been hanging around for weeks, and they even tell you to start enjoying it.
[02:15:54.191 --> 02:15:55.251]  Oh, it's aged beef.
[02:15:55.471 --> 02:15:56.052]  Oh, even better.
[02:15:56.172 --> 02:16:00.234]  They take something that's gross and advertise it as something good, and then you love it.
[02:16:00.254 --> 02:16:03.135]  I'm not trying to be gross here.
[02:16:03.355 --> 02:16:03.916]  I'm bad.
[02:16:03.936 --> 02:16:09.719]  Because I have an instinct, a hunting instinct, that got us where we are.
[02:16:09.859 --> 02:16:10.579]  All of you have it.
[02:16:13.140 --> 02:16:14.381]  To hunt something myself.
[02:16:17.222 --> 02:16:18.523]  And I don't have time to hunt anymore.
[02:16:19.605 --> 02:16:24.849]  I hadn't been hunting in probably six, seven years until last fall I went out and shot a deer.
[02:16:25.970 --> 02:16:29.732]  Then I went back out to my aunt and uncle's a few months later and she had this big pot roast of that deer.
[02:16:31.874 --> 02:16:33.315]  It was so good.
[02:16:34.195 --> 02:16:35.376]  So delicious.
[02:16:36.317 --> 02:16:38.278]  With all those carrots and potatoes.
[02:16:38.939 --> 02:16:39.779]  You know, I killed it.
[02:16:41.020 --> 02:16:43.722]  And by the way, you'd enjoy your chicken a little more if you took it out and
[02:16:46.929 --> 02:16:51.770]  Took a hatchet and cut its head off yourself and ripped that breast out yourself and washed it off yourself.
[02:16:52.430 --> 02:16:54.331]  No worry, a salmonella there.
[02:16:54.711 --> 02:16:59.732]  Took it in and threw it in the oven yourself and garnished it.
[02:17:00.772 --> 02:17:06.573]  But I'm bad because I like to drink filtered water and I like to occasionally kill something I'm going to eat.
[02:17:07.593 --> 02:17:10.154]  At the bare minimum, I like to eat things that are healthy for my family.
[02:17:13.294 --> 02:17:15.855]  Beef, where it lifts the farm in Texas where it came from.
[02:17:17.139 --> 02:17:18.399]  And you know I pay a lot more for it.
[02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:21.060]  So I'm evil.
[02:17:23.300 --> 02:17:34.842]  Because I'm not in a compact city learning how to be a good little slave waiting for my ID chip and waiting for my satellite tracker box in my car.
[02:17:34.862 --> 02:17:37.423]  Alright, I promise we'll go straight to your calls.
[02:17:38.963 --> 02:17:41.663]  Dave and Daryl and Bill and everybody else.
[02:17:43.184 --> 02:17:44.604]  Kyle, your calls are coming up.
[02:17:46.425 --> 02:17:49.306]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:17:49.646 --> 02:17:52.528]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:17:52.748 --> 02:17:58.950]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[02:17:59.330 --> 02:18:06.633]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[02:18:06.813 --> 02:18:10.915]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.

[02:18:42.436 --> 02:18:54.284]  The media is flooded with reports of everything from antibiotic-resistant super germs to the possibility of a flu epidemic due to a vaccine shortage.
[02:18:54.645 --> 02:18:59.328]  If we can't rely on traditional medicines, what are you going to do to keep you and your family healthy and safe?
[02:18:59.548 --> 02:19:03.431]  There is now a scientifically proven alternative called Super Silver Solution.
[02:19:03.651 --> 02:19:06.573]  Super Silver's combination of supercharged silver and oxygen
[02:19:06.953 --> 02:19:11.920]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[02:19:22.890 --> 02:19:29.274]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.

[02:19:49.440 --> 02:19:52.863]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[02:19:53.364 --> 02:19:54.044]  Let's update.
[02:19:54.545 --> 02:19:58.008]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[02:19:58.668 --> 02:20:02.391]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[02:20:03.052 --> 02:20:04.013]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[02:20:04.053 --> 02:20:06.375]  dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[02:20:06.895 --> 02:20:07.796]  Today, the U.S.
[02:20:07.816 --> 02:20:10.058]  dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[02:20:10.439 --> 02:20:11.980]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[02:20:12.540 --> 02:20:14.522]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283%.
[02:20:15.874 --> 02:20:20.735]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[02:20:21.715 --> 02:20:22.475]  Gold is moving.
[02:20:22.715 --> 02:20:23.895]  Equities are treading water.
[02:20:24.276 --> 02:20:26.936]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[02:20:27.476 --> 02:20:28.856]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[02:20:29.296 --> 02:20:30.997]  Physical possession, private gold.
[02:20:31.417 --> 02:20:33.377]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[02:20:33.797 --> 02:20:37.298]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[02:20:38.078 --> 02:20:38.918]  Protect yourself.
[02:20:39.178 --> 02:20:40.218]  Protect your loved ones.
[02:20:40.598 --> 02:20:40.899]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:46.610 --> 02:20:48.110]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:48.170 --> 02:20:50.551]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[02:20:50.911 --> 02:20:51.791]  Let me rephrase that.
[02:20:52.171 --> 02:20:53.371]  Oil War III has started.
[02:20:53.691 --> 02:20:56.132]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[02:20:56.552 --> 02:20:59.933]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[02:21:00.373 --> 02:21:04.214]  Why else would the US be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[02:21:04.454 --> 02:21:05.714]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[02:21:06.154 --> 02:21:10.635]  The nations of the earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[02:21:11.055 --> 02:21:15.036]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[02:21:15.576 --> 02:21:21.478]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.
[02:21:21.738 --> 02:21:27.819]  Call Ready Reserves at 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the free booklet and what you can do to prepare.
[02:21:28.339 --> 02:21:28.679]  That's 800-453-2202.
[02:21:28.739 --> 02:21:34.601]  After you read the booklet, you will understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[02:21:35.021 --> 02:21:35.261]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[02:21:35.281 --> 02:21:37.641]  Or email your request to ReadyReserves at AOL.com.
[02:21:37.661 --> 02:21:38.182]  That's 800-453-2202.
[02:21:49.090 --> 02:22:04.542]  Alright, let's go to your calls.
[02:22:04.582 --> 02:22:05.082]  Thanks for holding.
[02:22:05.102 --> 02:22:07.024]  I didn't mean to get off into the whole hunting issue.
[02:22:08.325 --> 02:22:14.089]  Let's talk to... I guess up next here is Kyle in California, then Daryl, Vince...
[02:22:14.972 --> 02:22:15.732]  Joseph and others.
[02:22:15.772 --> 02:22:16.493]  Go ahead, Kyle.
[02:22:16.513 --> 02:22:17.754]  Hi, Alex.
[02:22:17.954 --> 02:22:20.515]  I wanted to thank you for your hard work.
[02:22:20.795 --> 02:22:24.117]  I deeply appreciate your work ethic.
[02:22:24.477 --> 02:22:25.898]  I feel much the same about the food.
[02:22:25.958 --> 02:22:30.881]  If we put our hands on it and learn to appreciate it, we might have a little bit more knowledge concerning it.
[02:22:31.741 --> 02:22:34.302]  I've been diving through prisonplanet.tv.
[02:22:34.362 --> 02:22:36.904]  There's so much information there to open minds.
[02:22:37.004 --> 02:22:38.825]  I'm so thankful for that resource.
[02:22:39.725 --> 02:22:42.587]  I want to address something that your guest, Man Cowell,
[02:22:43.875 --> 02:22:50.761]  No, no, that's why I had him on to let you see what we're talking about.
[02:22:50.801 --> 02:22:53.724]  He's against the police state, but let's go ahead and level the cities.
[02:22:53.744 --> 02:22:54.925]  I thought we were there to save them.
[02:22:55.526 --> 02:22:56.767]  Put Saddam in to begin with.
[02:22:56.787 --> 02:22:58.308]  By the way, it's public, mainstream news.
[02:23:05.795 --> 02:23:07.675]  No one is running against a Wally.
[02:23:08.236 --> 02:23:11.896]  Openly, people have been told, if anyone runs against him in the election, they're dead.
[02:23:12.256 --> 02:23:15.617]  The election is a month and a half away, and no one is running.
[02:23:16.037 --> 02:23:18.718]  It's already happened in Afghanistan.
[02:23:18.958 --> 02:23:20.438]  Everyone started getting bought on.
[02:23:20.458 --> 02:23:25.399]  They told them, we will burn your house down if you don't run for the Unicol executive, Mohamed Karzai.
[02:23:25.699 --> 02:23:27.540]  We don't get to hear about that, unfortunately.
[02:23:27.860 --> 02:23:34.041]  I wanted to ask you, because this little piece I heard about the human hybrid that I feel like could be a
[02:23:34.659 --> 02:23:37.162]  Well, this weekend, again, I was on KFI for an hour.
[02:23:50.010 --> 02:24:11.708]  And then I was doing house chores, so I just left it on on the computer out of Los Angeles, and the host whose show I'd been on for the hour before, a good guy, went into the next hour, he read a couple AP reports, some other reports, I went and pulled them up on the computer, didn't end up bringing them here today, because frankly my cartridge was out of ink at the time, and then by Sunday when I bought a cartridge, I'd forgotten to reprint it, so I didn't print it.
[02:24:12.228 --> 02:24:12.709]  Hey, guys.
[02:24:12.809 --> 02:24:15.410]  But it was Bush went to the U.N.
[02:24:15.450 --> 02:24:16.831]  I've also heard this on the news.
[02:24:16.952 --> 02:24:17.792]  And we need to cover cloning.
[02:24:17.812 --> 02:24:19.293]  It's something I haven't gotten into enough lately.
[02:24:19.313 --> 02:24:21.194]  It's a show to see humanization.
[02:24:22.075 --> 02:24:22.956]  Bush went to the U.N.
[02:24:22.976 --> 02:24:24.737]  and said, okay, we're giving up on banning cloning.
[02:24:24.757 --> 02:24:25.437]  We never meant to.
[02:24:25.918 --> 02:24:26.358]  The U.N.
[02:24:26.418 --> 02:24:27.199]  is legalizing it.
[02:24:27.279 --> 02:24:33.603]  And then the guy read the AP article where having a fully born, living in a cage human is illegal.
[02:24:34.064 --> 02:24:36.765]  But if you mix some monkey genes in, it's okay.
[02:24:36.785 --> 02:24:41.369]  So these are really humans already cloned and alive, these humansies.
[02:24:42.789 --> 02:24:43.950]  He was reading mainstream reports.
[02:24:44.310 --> 02:24:45.030]  I went and pulled them up.
[02:24:45.470 --> 02:24:46.370]  Yeah.
[02:24:46.510 --> 02:24:47.431]  These have got to be real.
[02:24:47.451 --> 02:24:49.251]  There's got to be... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:24:49.291 --> 02:24:50.092]  It's all public now.
[02:24:50.132 --> 02:24:52.533]  They have manzies in Argentina.
[02:24:52.933 --> 02:24:54.313]  Oh, we're in big trouble.
[02:24:54.533 --> 02:24:56.934]  Yeah, and see, it's not even big news.
[02:24:57.514 --> 02:25:04.217]  You know, I go pull it up, and I'm busy with other stuff, and don't print it off, and don't have it for you, and I've got so much happening that I drop the ball.
[02:25:04.972 --> 02:25:07.034]  You're crazy if you bring it up, though, also.
[02:25:07.114 --> 02:25:11.758]  Yeah, it's like, hey, the Mexican judicial workers, now over a thousand have been forced to take chips.
[02:25:12.199 --> 02:25:14.321]  Okay, I heard that on the news, but you're still a kook because you're against it.
[02:25:14.601 --> 02:25:18.024]  Well, they've got, again, because it's not human, they're allowed to do it.
[02:25:18.785 --> 02:25:24.710]  Human pigs, goats and spiders, humans and apes.
[02:25:25.811 --> 02:25:27.733]  I'll mention something about the chips to somebody.
[02:25:27.873 --> 02:25:30.576]  By the way, they're now growing human embryos in mice.
[02:25:31.209 --> 02:25:31.849]  Oh, wow.
[02:25:32.190 --> 02:25:33.090]  That's unbelievable.
[02:25:33.130 --> 02:25:38.072]  Yeah, I bring up the chips to some people and they think I'm talking about a science fiction movie that I just watched.
[02:25:38.372 --> 02:25:42.614]  But then when they see it on the nightly news, it suddenly exists, but you're kooky not to like it.
[02:25:42.834 --> 02:25:43.875]  Yeah, very funny.
[02:25:43.935 --> 02:25:44.915]  Real quick.
[02:25:44.975 --> 02:25:52.559]  Really quickly, I just wanted to address a concern I have because we're all into this nationalism and racism and stuff that I just wanted to
[02:25:53.106 --> 02:26:00.190]  To bring to light that we're going to need every type of race, every gender, every creed to... Yeah, but don't equate that with nationalism.
[02:26:00.731 --> 02:26:01.851]  Nationalism isn't bad.
[02:26:01.871 --> 02:26:04.253]  The globalists use it when they want to attack somebody.
[02:26:04.273 --> 02:26:06.374]  Exactly, wrapping people in the flag and whatnot.
[02:26:06.454 --> 02:26:09.776]  I think these are things that we're going to have to combat.
[02:26:09.836 --> 02:26:10.697]  I agree with you.
[02:26:10.717 --> 02:26:11.718]  We need to work with everybody.
[02:26:11.758 --> 02:26:12.718]  I don't care what color you are.
[02:26:12.738 --> 02:26:13.318]  Thanks for the call.
[02:26:13.339 --> 02:26:13.979]  Good to hear from you.
[02:26:14.559 --> 02:26:16.200]  Let's talk to Daryl in Pennsylvania.
[02:26:16.240 --> 02:26:17.041]  Daryl, go ahead.
[02:26:17.941 --> 02:26:22.084]  Yeah, Alex, I'd like to put out a general warning, if you'd allow, on two items quickly.
[02:26:22.788 --> 02:26:30.674]  One caller today referenced some prophecy guy on TBN, and for the listeners, that's Trinity Broadcasting Network, for you to check out, Alex.
[02:26:30.754 --> 02:26:50.087]  And as you probably know, your friend and mine, Tex Marr, has very recently put out an excellent video entitled Tower of Infamy that exposes TBN and a number of very famous televangelists, some of whom are 33 degree masons who have been sponsored by such folks as Knights of Malta, and one was even helped by Ted Turner.
[02:26:50.748 --> 02:26:58.211]  So my warning on this is, please, everyone, be extremely wary of anything coming off TBN or from the mouths of these televangelists.
[02:26:58.231 --> 02:26:59.012]  This is what they'll do.
[02:26:59.032 --> 02:27:01.633]  The Antichrist system is upon us.
[02:27:01.733 --> 02:27:03.194]  The chip is now being put in people.
[02:27:03.534 --> 02:27:05.035]  Bush is fighting it valiantly.
[02:27:05.095 --> 02:27:06.395]  He is God's designate.
[02:27:07.015 --> 02:27:08.996]  Or the chip's good for us.
[02:27:09.016 --> 02:27:14.979]  So they tell you the truth about what's happening, but then say, oh, but this group's fighting against it, when in truth, they're ramming it through.
[02:27:14.999 --> 02:27:16.500]  Can I hang through the break?
[02:27:16.580 --> 02:27:17.320]  Yes, you can, Darrell.
[02:27:17.340 --> 02:27:18.221]  You've been holding a long time.
[02:27:18.241 --> 02:27:19.041]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[02:27:19.713 --> 02:27:21.715]  And then Vince and Joseph and others, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:27:21.795 --> 02:27:25.798]  Straight to your calls.
[02:27:25.838 --> 02:27:27.319]  Some audio clips coming up as well.
[02:27:27.339 --> 02:27:28.680]  Don't want to miss the final 30 minutes.
[02:27:28.920 --> 02:27:30.101]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:27:30.121 --> 02:27:30.621]  Check it out!
[02:27:36.326 --> 02:27:37.226]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.707 --> 02:27:39.308]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.229 --> 02:27:42.911]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.175 --> 02:27:50.157]  Are you concerned about the quality of air and purity of water in your household?
[02:27:50.597 --> 02:27:57.641]  If you answered yes, then you owe it to yourself and your family to check out the amazing benefits of owning your own personal ozone generator.
[02:27:58.021 --> 02:28:02.103]  With an ozone generator, you can kill bacteria and viruses in your drinking water
[02:28:02.643 --> 02:28:05.925]  Get rid of that stale air in your house that keeps recirculating.
[02:28:06.285 --> 02:28:11.148]  Your new ozone generator will remove odors and provide a clean, fresh scent throughout your house.
[02:28:11.608 --> 02:28:16.271]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises for one of the most affordable ozone generators available today.

[02:28:29.418 --> 02:28:30.759]  Best of all, it's affordable.
[02:28:31.119 --> 02:28:34.722]  It's only $385 and that includes the shipping.

[02:28:53.197 --> 02:29:06.193]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark yet require very little energy.
[02:29:06.473 --> 02:29:09.777]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:29:10.117 --> 02:29:20.585]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:29:20.865 --> 02:29:21.365]  That's right.

[02:31:48.265 --> 02:32:12.395]  Lord knows where we'd be When it comes to heroes and renegades of mine They railed against the crowd Another ragtag band
[02:32:13.587 --> 02:32:16.569]  We're good to go.
[02:33:02.120 --> 02:33:04.290]  We're good to go.
[02:33:29.667 --> 02:33:34.769]  All right, folks, sorry I ran that song, but I just, during the break, got the answers for myself here.
[02:33:36.349 --> 02:33:37.910]  And the answer is yes.
[02:33:37.970 --> 02:33:43.372]  The new Freedom Initiative, the forced psychological testing of your children, did pass.
[02:33:44.392 --> 02:33:45.152]  Let me say that again.
[02:33:46.132 --> 02:33:47.333]  And this is nowhere on the web.
[02:33:47.373 --> 02:33:50.454]  We're putting it on Infowars.com right now.
[02:33:53.068 --> 02:33:56.971]  I just kept thinking somebody else would do this this weekend, and then I have to call Ron Paul's office.
[02:33:57.091 --> 02:33:58.953]  I'm not whining.
[02:33:58.973 --> 02:33:59.753]  I have to do everything.
[02:34:01.114 --> 02:34:02.415]  So, yes, it passed.
[02:34:02.535 --> 02:34:06.378]  It passed, it passed, it passed, it passed, and Bush says he's going to sign it.
[02:34:08.460 --> 02:34:09.741]  And if I sound angry, I am.
[02:34:10.902 --> 02:34:18.787]  Forced psychological testing of every child in the country from age 4 up to 18, then starting funding for all women who are pregnant.
[02:34:19.448 --> 02:34:21.910]  Forcibly social workers come in, these predators.
[02:34:23.132 --> 02:34:33.539]  Coming to your house, your home school, your church school, your private school, your public school, forcibly, psychologically testing them according to guidelines publicly written by the drug companies.
[02:34:34.160 --> 02:34:34.860]  It passed.
[02:34:35.340 --> 02:34:36.041]  It passed.
[02:34:36.501 --> 02:34:37.182]  It passed.
[02:34:37.602 --> 02:34:38.202]  It passed.
[02:34:38.323 --> 02:34:46.108]  I just got it directly from Jeff Deist, the head guy for Ron Paul, just a minute and a half ago.
[02:34:48.044 --> 02:34:50.865]  The 9-11 National ID card did not pass.
[02:34:51.165 --> 02:34:57.226]  Hastert says they're bringing it back in December, just like they did with the Federal Reserve and the income tax and every other nasty thing.
[02:34:57.886 --> 02:35:01.527]  And three senators can call a quorum in the middle of Christmas if they want.
[02:35:01.827 --> 02:35:02.928]  That's when a lot of it happens.
[02:35:03.848 --> 02:35:05.488]  And they can ram it through on you, baby.
[02:35:07.349 --> 02:35:08.469]  So there's your answer.
[02:35:09.929 --> 02:35:12.110]  And I just got smoke coming out of my ears.
[02:35:12.430 --> 02:35:14.511]  So I promised you I'd give you an answer.
[02:35:14.931 --> 02:35:15.391]  We did it.
[02:35:15.591 --> 02:35:16.231]  I made the call.
[02:35:17.788 --> 02:35:18.248]  All right.
[02:35:18.588 --> 02:35:20.909]  Oh, I'm angry now.
[02:35:22.650 --> 02:35:27.072]  Let's go ahead and go back to Darrell in Pennsylvania.
[02:35:27.092 --> 02:35:27.812]  Darrell, go ahead.
[02:35:27.912 --> 02:35:41.558]  Yeah, Alex, and to finish up the first warning, the main reason why we need to stay away from these televangelists is because good men like Tex Mars have carefully documented that the mainstream Christian media is controlled by the globalist rich elite.
[02:35:42.242 --> 02:35:47.683]  The second item, Alex, is that another caller called in and said that he referenced the vision he'd had.
[02:35:48.043 --> 02:36:00.105]  In general, we've got to be so wary and careful about dreams, visions, and apparitions, because many of these dreams and visions, in fact, the vast majority of them, have been proven to be false throughout history, Alex.
[02:36:00.265 --> 02:36:02.465]  For example, who's the Antichrist?
[02:36:02.906 --> 02:36:11.387]  Another thing, Alex, I've read some very thick books on these visions, the apparitions of Mary, etc., and I've come to the same conclusion that Tex Mars has.
[02:36:11.829 --> 02:36:19.035]  And that is that most of these visions, prophecies, messages are almost all diametrically opposed to what the Bible teaches.
[02:36:19.095 --> 02:36:26.700]  And the bottom line is, we do not have time to be trying to figure out who the Antichrist is or what month Jesus Christ is coming back in.
[02:36:27.061 --> 02:36:37.949]  But rather, we should all be obeying the numerous Bible passages that tell us that we're duty-bound, Alex, to be exposing corruption and evil and to be resisting tyranny and
[02:36:38.294 --> 02:36:41.815]  We need to be fighting against the evil that we can clearly see right now.
[02:36:41.835 --> 02:36:51.059]  And the Bible says that hundreds of times, and then they take Romans 13 and try to distort it, but talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger, he has his own visions.
[02:36:52.820 --> 02:37:04.425]  I have the article here out of the London Observer, and this is from the folks that made Pumping Iron with him, the directors, his friends, and it says that Arnold told him he had a recurring dream.
[02:37:04.445 --> 02:37:07.826]  He was a king of all the earth, and everybody looked up to him,
[02:37:09.229 --> 02:37:12.192]  He said that Arnold came to them with what he called the Master Plan.
[02:37:12.212 --> 02:37:15.615]  It was kind of a mix of Nietzsche and Soviet five-year plan.
[02:37:16.075 --> 02:37:18.397]  Only it was more than a 50-year plan, Butler recalled.
[02:37:18.637 --> 02:37:19.718]  He wanted to be very big.
[02:37:19.738 --> 02:37:27.104]  My own particular view is that he, in his mind, wanted to be President of the United States, King of the Universe, probably, if there are extraterrestrials out there.
[02:37:27.445 --> 02:37:28.626]  He liked to rule them as well.
[02:37:28.746 --> 02:37:31.288]  Arnold had laid out the Master Plan for Butler.
[02:37:31.308 --> 02:37:34.791]  I will come to America, which is the country for me.
[02:37:34.811 --> 02:37:36.913]  I will become a bodybuilder, get into real estate.
[02:37:37.734 --> 02:37:37.994]  Yeah, like the...
[02:38:00.297 --> 02:38:09.387]  You just have to wonder how many of these dreams and visions come straight from demons and or from eating a spicy pizza with hot sauce just before you went to bed.
[02:38:09.747 --> 02:38:11.329]  I would like to plead with the listeners.
[02:38:12.045 --> 02:38:15.848]  Please do not call in with the latest visions, because so many of them prove false.
[02:38:16.148 --> 02:38:23.433]  I want to thank you, Alex, for allowing me to put that out, and also for deflecting the call-ins that promote the false idea that the Jews run the Illuminati.
[02:38:23.653 --> 02:38:30.959]  I just say God bless you and Violet, Alex, and thanks for all you do to expose corruption, and I beg the listeners, please get Alex's great videos.
[02:38:31.019 --> 02:38:31.659]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:38:32.060 --> 02:38:32.780]  Well, thank you.
[02:38:33.240 --> 02:38:38.284]  Look, I mean, it's hard enough when the Mexican government's making their judicial workers, now over 1,000,
[02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:42.521]  Talking about making every federal rally take it.
[02:38:43.082 --> 02:38:44.162]  Other governments talking about it.
[02:38:44.383 --> 02:38:46.004]  Special forces already getting in here.
[02:38:46.904 --> 02:38:48.966]  Open pushing of it every night on the news.
[02:38:49.126 --> 02:38:49.486]  Every night.
[02:38:49.646 --> 02:38:49.946]  Somewhere.
[02:38:49.966 --> 02:38:50.287]  I see it.
[02:38:51.547 --> 02:38:53.088]  In print or on the TV.
[02:38:53.729 --> 02:38:55.850]  And then we talk about it, and we're the weirdos.
[02:38:55.930 --> 02:38:56.831]  Oh, you're not for it.
[02:38:56.851 --> 02:38:58.032]  Well, you're bad.
[02:39:00.333 --> 02:39:01.494]  All of this is crazy.
[02:39:03.956 --> 02:39:07.138]  I mean, Arnold Schwarzenegger's DMV head, the new one he appointed...
[02:39:08.078 --> 02:39:13.100]  Comes out, and now DMV head in Texas, DMV head in Wisconsin, DMV head in Oregon.
[02:39:15.481 --> 02:39:18.542]  They're saying, we're going to put satellite boxes or transponders in your cars.
[02:39:18.562 --> 02:39:19.362]  We're going to do it.
[02:39:19.402 --> 02:39:21.363]  We're going to tax you 25 cents a mile.
[02:39:21.983 --> 02:39:25.945]  When it's 18 cents a gallon, right now that's roughly 20 times increase.
[02:39:26.425 --> 02:39:28.486]  Because, quote, we're not raising enough money off gas tax.
[02:39:28.766 --> 02:39:30.646]  We're using more fuel than ever, folks.
[02:39:32.727 --> 02:39:37.229]  What, from like 18 million barrels a day to like 24 million barrels a day or something?
[02:39:39.750 --> 02:39:42.271]  So that's lie number one in all these articles.
[02:39:42.611 --> 02:39:49.915]  We've got to do this because the feds say we're not raising enough money with our cut at the state level.
[02:39:51.055 --> 02:39:53.537]  Because people are driving fuel efficient cars.
[02:39:53.777 --> 02:39:55.177]  We're using more fuel than ever.
[02:39:57.378 --> 02:39:59.640]  I may go, but don't worry, this new thing will save you money.
[02:39:59.660 --> 02:40:01.480]  And then it says 25 cents a mile.
[02:40:02.181 --> 02:40:03.201]  In peak, even higher.
[02:40:03.461 --> 02:40:05.562]  It's 18 cents a gallon right now.
[02:40:05.702 --> 02:40:08.944]  Average, what, 22, 24 miles a gallon, the average car out there?
[02:40:09.989 --> 02:40:11.070]  I mean, do the math.
[02:40:11.290 --> 02:40:19.276]  24 times... Again, do the math.
[02:40:19.296 --> 02:40:24.480]  18 cents a gallon tax in California versus 25 cents a mile.
[02:40:26.302 --> 02:40:33.868]  So 25 times 22, or 24, depending on the average that month for gas users in California.
[02:40:34.668 --> 02:40:36.430]  So would you rather pay... Let me ask you this question.
[02:40:36.550 --> 02:40:37.271]  You're like at the store.
[02:40:37.891 --> 02:40:39.012]  Would you rather pay
[02:40:41.345 --> 02:40:46.171]  25 times 24, or would you rather pay 18 cents?
[02:40:47.352 --> 02:40:47.933]  Do the math.
[02:40:47.993 --> 02:40:48.333]  What is 24 times 25?
[02:40:48.373 --> 02:40:50.336]  So that would be 600 cents.
[02:41:01.477 --> 02:41:06.699]  A gallon or $6 versus 18 cents!
[02:41:07.619 --> 02:41:09.700]  And they call it a better deal!
[02:41:09.820 --> 02:41:14.182]  I have the Associated Press article posted on InfoWars.com.
[02:41:14.202 --> 02:41:14.902]  It was last week.
[02:41:14.922 --> 02:41:15.843]  Never covered it properly.
[02:41:16.323 --> 02:41:17.924]  I printed all the articles off this morning.
[02:41:17.944 --> 02:41:18.684]  I have them here in front of me.
[02:41:18.704 --> 02:41:19.964]  Let me just dig that out.
[02:41:19.984 --> 02:41:24.446]  $6 versus 18 cents!
[02:41:27.730 --> 02:41:36.935]  And I heard Clark Howard a week ago, the guy that tells you how to save money financially, going, oh, this satellite tracking your transponders, a great idea.
[02:41:37.376 --> 02:41:39.177]  It'll save you money.
[02:41:40.077 --> 02:41:41.718]  We've got to do it because of the hybrid cars.
[02:41:41.918 --> 02:41:43.899]  They're getting record gas tax money.
[02:41:44.560 --> 02:41:54.225]  The government's got money coming out of its ears, but it doesn't give you the services, let stuff fall apart, and then says we've got to raise taxes locally or no new fire trucks or police cars or no radios.
[02:41:56.061 --> 02:41:58.023]  And you go, okay, I guess I'll pay you again.
[02:42:00.206 --> 02:42:02.288]  And I hear people calling the talk shows going, is he true?
[02:42:02.749 --> 02:42:04.130]  You know, I hear Arnold's got a plan.
[02:42:04.150 --> 02:42:07.714]  Now, be clear, it isn't Arnold, it's his DMV guy he appointed.
[02:42:08.995 --> 02:42:10.838]  Well, Bush has introduced a bill for total amnesty.
[02:42:10.858 --> 02:42:16.424]  Now, be clear, he may have called for it in the State of the Union, but he said it's not an amnesty, and he's not doing it, just Karl Rovis.
[02:42:19.008 --> 02:42:20.229]  I got the Houston Chronicle.
[02:42:20.429 --> 02:42:21.890]  I got the Green Bay Newspaper.
[02:42:21.970 --> 02:42:23.131]  I got L.A.
[02:42:23.191 --> 02:42:24.692]  Times.
[02:42:24.792 --> 02:42:26.213]  New York's trying to pass bills.
[02:42:26.633 --> 02:42:28.495]  They're trying to pass the bills.
[02:42:29.515 --> 02:42:42.824]  And when you gripe about a satellite tracker box in your car, which they'll pay for when you get your tags, 50 bucks on average, they'll go, okay, well, you have a choice, the transponder.
[02:42:43.225 --> 02:42:46.026]  But they got the radio readers for these high-powered transponders.
[02:42:46.547 --> 02:42:47.908]  They're about the size of a matchbox.
[02:42:49.005 --> 02:42:49.905]  It goes on your dash.
[02:42:49.925 --> 02:42:50.546]  You already got them.
[02:42:51.226 --> 02:42:52.646]  Every state I've been to lately has got them.
[02:42:53.267 --> 02:42:54.287]  For toll roads and everything.
[02:42:54.527 --> 02:42:56.668]  People got them because you get half price when you got it.
[02:42:57.068 --> 02:43:05.551]  But we can still pay cash to the one lane that's got a line a mile long of people trying to pay cash who aren't locals or just take the KTAG transponder.
[02:43:06.311 --> 02:43:11.293]  That thing from point to point will read how far you drove, what your average speed was.
[02:43:12.486 --> 02:43:13.066]  Oh, forget that.
[02:43:13.106 --> 02:43:13.787]  You don't like that?
[02:43:14.267 --> 02:43:15.327]  They already put it in London.
[02:43:15.387 --> 02:43:17.188]  It's going in all over the U.S.
[02:43:17.428 --> 02:43:22.090]  These license plate readers, where it instantly reads every license plate, and data's that number.
[02:43:22.130 --> 02:43:24.611]  They already know how fast you're driving, where you go, what you did.
[02:43:24.951 --> 02:43:31.454]  Every small four-way stop, every country lane, the state or federal road, has cameras on it.
[02:43:31.494 --> 02:43:37.677]  I mean, I've been out in the middle of nowhere where you haven't seen a gas station on a town in 80 miles.
[02:43:38.157 --> 02:43:40.738]  And you'll drive to a four-way stop, and there are the cameras.
[02:43:44.201 --> 02:43:47.643]  And out there, they'll have a dish on top, transmitting it via satellite.
[02:43:48.304 --> 02:43:49.765]  Or a microwave tower relaying it.
[02:43:49.805 --> 02:43:53.367]  I mean, they put big money into this, because everywhere you go, you're already tracked, folks.
[02:43:53.727 --> 02:43:54.868]  Now they're going to tax you with it.
[02:43:55.028 --> 02:44:00.252]  Okay, you don't like transponders, don't like satellite boxes, we'll just use the cameras.
[02:44:00.312 --> 02:44:01.232]  London's already doing it.
[02:44:03.574 --> 02:44:11.639]  And I warned you, and I warned you, and I got so many emails over the years, you nut, there's no plan to put stuff in our cars, when I had the federal plan seven plus years ago.
[02:44:11.999 --> 02:44:13.100]  And now they're going to do it to you.
[02:44:14.309 --> 02:44:18.030]  Major polls, California, 95.4% against it.
[02:44:19.611 --> 02:44:21.391]  Polls in Texas, 98-93% are against it.
[02:44:21.411 --> 02:44:24.492]  We're going to have transponders in Austin within two years.
[02:44:25.332 --> 02:44:31.294]  And the politicians just laugh and say, vote us out of office, and actually turn red and start laughing.
[02:44:31.454 --> 02:44:32.134]  It's funny!
[02:44:32.154 --> 02:44:38.196]  Because they've got special voting machines going in, whether it's Houston or Austin, once the special machines are in.
[02:44:39.304 --> 02:44:43.268]  Suddenly the cameras don't just go up in your neighborhoods, but they go up right in front of your house.
[02:44:43.289 --> 02:44:43.949]  They go up everywhere.
[02:44:44.270 --> 02:44:45.671]  Suddenly they start laughing at you.
[02:44:45.711 --> 02:44:47.473]  Suddenly armored vehicles start driving around.
[02:44:47.793 --> 02:44:49.575]  Suddenly they start tasering five-year-olds.
[02:44:49.896 --> 02:44:52.118]  Suddenly they start laughing at you and setting up checkpoints.
[02:44:52.318 --> 02:44:53.940]  It's real funny, isn't it?
[02:44:55.502 --> 02:44:56.383]  Vince in Indiana.
[02:44:56.403 --> 02:44:57.083]  Vince, go ahead.
[02:44:57.103 --> 02:45:01.208]  Hey Alex, I got some comments about the hunting massacre in Wisconsin.
[02:45:01.964 --> 02:45:09.925]  I live in the Chicago, Illinois area, but I have lived in that area right up there in Rice Lake, Wisconsin, and I have lots of relatives up there in that area.
[02:45:09.985 --> 02:45:10.906]  I know it very well.
[02:45:11.666 --> 02:45:22.308]  And I've always been pretty proud of the hunting culture up there and the gun culture, especially versus the very draconian Illinois laws against guns and hunting and all that.
[02:45:23.388 --> 02:45:30.189]  And I'm quite suspicious, though, of this massacre that we just had, because this guy...
[02:45:30.794 --> 02:45:38.318]  It was apparently an immigrant, yet from what I've heard from some of the people I've spoken up there, that this immigrant speaks perfect English.
[02:45:39.698 --> 02:45:42.800]  And just my thoughts that maybe this is part of the New World Order.
[02:45:42.820 --> 02:45:47.422]  Well, even Rush Limbaugh said every time they introduce a gun bill, there's a convenient shooting right on time.
[02:45:47.482 --> 02:45:49.503]  I mean, Columbine was a government op.
[02:45:50.543 --> 02:45:51.244]  I wouldn't doubt it.
[02:45:51.304 --> 02:45:53.845]  You know, I think this could be part of the problem action solution.
[02:45:53.925 --> 02:45:55.986]  And notice it's an assault weapon, see?
[02:45:56.786 --> 02:46:00.488]  Well, you're already not allowed to use something with over five rounds in it in most states.
[02:46:02.237 --> 02:46:05.630]  My thoughts are that I'd like to know this guy's background.
[02:46:06.628 --> 02:46:07.128]  Oh, don't worry.
[02:46:07.168 --> 02:46:10.309]  When it comes out, he would have been in a federal psychiatric institution.
[02:46:10.349 --> 02:46:11.229]  In every case, they are.
[02:46:11.929 --> 02:46:15.590]  In every mass shooting case he's had, he's been on Ritalin or Prozac or both.
[02:46:15.830 --> 02:46:17.690]  I think he very might be an agent.
[02:46:17.770 --> 02:46:18.550]  I'm not joking.
[02:46:18.750 --> 02:46:22.231]  Harris, Kleibold, Kip Kinkle, the woman drowning her kids.
[02:46:22.331 --> 02:46:26.212]  In every case, I've never seen one where they weren't on these drugs.
[02:46:26.572 --> 02:46:31.413]  And I bet, I mean, the odds are 100 to 1, this guy was hopped up on stuff.
[02:46:31.733 --> 02:46:32.193]  And you know what?
[02:46:32.213 --> 02:46:34.595]  There's been a lot of controversy up in the Minneapolis, St.
[02:46:34.615 --> 02:46:39.998]  Paul, and Wisconsin area about having a lot of these immigrants come over and take these low-paying jobs.
[02:46:40.398 --> 02:46:43.179]  And a lot of people are very much against it.
[02:46:43.199 --> 02:46:50.403]  And then you've got the neocons that are very much for having all these immigrants come in and take the jobs at the slaughterhouses, the turkey factories, or whatever.
[02:46:50.983 --> 02:46:53.105]  And then you see things like this happen.
[02:46:53.125 --> 02:46:59.308]  Well, I'm not bashing foreigners, but some of these cultures have never touched anything, run anything, done anything.
[02:47:00.527 --> 02:47:01.468]  And they get over here.
[02:47:01.488 --> 02:47:07.252]  I mean, I was out one time going fishing, and I saw this poor Chinese guy try to get in a rented boat and start ramming it into the dock.
[02:47:08.533 --> 02:47:09.874]  You know, nobody taught him how.
[02:47:10.034 --> 02:47:10.835]  He didn't know he had to.
[02:47:11.175 --> 02:47:17.920]  You know, these folks on the roads who get in front of you, and there's a whole lane for them to merge, but they pull out the middle of the expressway and stop.
[02:47:18.758 --> 02:47:26.463]  And, you know, I've been at gun shops, seen these foreigners who don't know which end of a gun shoots the projectile out, you know, walking out with guns.
[02:47:27.023 --> 02:47:27.844]  That is scary.
[02:47:27.924 --> 02:47:30.466]  More the reason we need to have guns to protect ourselves.
[02:47:30.566 --> 02:47:34.989]  Yeah, well, I expect the neocons and the New World Order people to be all over this.
[02:47:35.329 --> 02:47:38.391]  And it probably is all happening for a reason.
[02:47:38.451 --> 02:47:40.672]  They're a little problem, action, solution.
[02:47:40.712 --> 02:47:43.094]  But I'm suspicious of this guy's background.
[02:47:43.638 --> 02:47:45.738]  And I just wonder who he is.
[02:47:45.818 --> 02:47:47.299]  It's so senseless what happened.
[02:47:47.319 --> 02:47:47.919]  Let me guess.
[02:47:48.279 --> 02:47:49.399]  I'll try to guess what it was.
[02:47:49.479 --> 02:47:52.360]  He'll be a foreigner who joined the military.
[02:47:52.400 --> 02:47:53.120]  He was involved.
[02:47:53.520 --> 02:47:56.920]  And he would have been in the psychological care of some mind control doctor.
[02:47:57.180 --> 02:47:57.801]  Thanks for the call.
[02:47:58.441 --> 02:47:59.761]  And I'm not even being sarcastic, folks.
[02:47:59.801 --> 02:48:10.943]  I really think, I mean, in all these cases that comes up, you know, that Mohammed guy with the shootings up there with the snipers, total mind control.
[02:48:11.485 --> 02:48:20.129]  Seeing mind control doctors, Gulf War vet, Harrison Kleibold in psychiatric care, the FBI founding the group.
[02:48:22.530 --> 02:48:23.571]  Oh, I don't want to get off into it.
[02:48:23.591 --> 02:48:24.671]  It just goes on for hours.
[02:48:26.132 --> 02:48:28.073]  But there are just crazy scum out there, too.
[02:48:29.734 --> 02:48:31.755]  But stuff like this has never happened.
[02:48:36.377 --> 02:48:39.058]  I mean, imagine walking up to somebody on your own property, and they just shoot you.
[02:48:42.358 --> 02:48:42.538]  Ha!
[02:48:42.658 --> 02:48:45.241]  PrisonPlanet.tv, stay with us.
[02:48:46.182 --> 02:48:47.683]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.883 --> 02:48:50.966]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:51.106 --> 02:48:54.990]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:55.030 --> 02:48:59.294]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:59.634 --> 02:49:03.418]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.538 --> 02:49:05.360]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:08.603 --> 02:49:13.589]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.749 --> 02:49:16.793]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[02:49:16.973 --> 02:49:19.836]  They are being led into the Sandpoint brig.
[02:49:20.337 --> 02:49:26.444]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.964 --> 02:49:28.806]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[02:49:45.419 --> 02:49:47.400]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[02:49:47.480 --> 02:49:58.185]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:49:58.565 --> 02:50:03.087]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:50:03.147 --> 02:50:14.492]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:50:15.072 --> 02:50:21.935]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:50:22.316 --> 02:50:24.477]  Your purified water is now ready.
[02:50:24.957 --> 02:50:29.939]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[02:51:52.065 --> 02:51:56.927]  Even worse dictator quotes and comments going up on...
[02:51:57.777 --> 02:52:00.578]  ArnoldExposed.com today, if they're not already up there.
[02:52:00.979 --> 02:52:11.584]  Here's a clip, kind of bad audio, from Demolition Man in 93, where Sylvester Stallone gets out of prison, and he's been frozen, and Arnold Schwarzenegger's the president.
[02:52:12.004 --> 02:52:12.644]  So, here it is.
[02:52:12.664 --> 02:52:19.887]  I have, in fact, produced some newsreels from the Schwarzenegger Library, and that time that you took that card... Hold it.
[02:52:21.408 --> 02:52:22.669]  The Schwarzenegger Library?
[02:52:22.689 --> 02:52:25.030]  Yes, the Schwarzenegger Presidential Library.
[02:52:26.509 --> 02:52:30.334]  All right, let's go to Joseph in England, who's been holding.
[02:52:30.354 --> 02:52:31.114]  Joseph, go ahead.
[02:52:45.706 --> 02:52:46.106]  Hey, Alex.
[02:52:46.266 --> 02:52:47.647]  Check this out for Synchronicity.
[02:52:47.667 --> 02:52:50.869]  It's actually me that sent you that audio clip from Demolition Man.
[02:52:51.270 --> 02:52:52.410]  That's pretty good.
[02:52:52.430 --> 02:52:53.291]  That is Synchronicity.
[02:52:53.611 --> 02:52:56.013]  If you want, I can do your video clip, but that's neither by the by.
[02:52:56.033 --> 02:52:56.993]  I'll send it to you if you use it.
[02:52:57.013 --> 02:52:57.594]  That's your business.
[02:52:58.174 --> 02:53:00.415]  The point is, actually, it's about Schwarzenegger.
[02:53:00.636 --> 02:53:04.238]  We've got a TV show in our country called Graham Norton, or at least we used to.
[02:53:04.278 --> 02:53:05.239]  I haven't watched it for a while.
[02:53:05.859 --> 02:53:10.422]  And once they had Linda Hamilton, you know, the actress that played Sarah Connor in The Terminator.
[02:53:10.862 --> 02:53:11.042]  Yes.
[02:53:11.623 --> 02:53:14.985]  And you tell this story about how she's got a twin sister, and...
[02:53:15.486 --> 02:53:21.169]  There was a moment in the film where they had to use a twin sister for a sequence because it was, like, done with special effects.
[02:53:22.129 --> 02:53:29.632]  And Schwarzenegger, of course, doesn't know that she has a twin sister, and there's one bit where she was bent down, not in the film, I won't go into vulgar detail here, by the way.
[02:53:30.093 --> 02:53:35.435]  She's bent over, Schwarzenegger goes, like, up behind her, and you can use your imagination what he starts doing, groping her, basically.
[02:53:35.875 --> 02:53:38.857]  And, of course, she turns around and says, ''Ah, you think I'm Linda, don't you?''
[02:53:38.877 --> 02:53:39.377]  sort of thing.
[02:53:40.089 --> 02:53:52.022]  That's just another example of... Yeah, there are mainstream news articles in the Premier Magazine article where they're in the limo and it was James Cameron's girlfriend and Arnold didn't care.
[02:53:52.042 --> 02:53:58.789]  He just grabbed her and started, well, you know what somebody does with their body, right in front of him and he did nothing.
[02:53:58.809 --> 02:54:00.611]  I mean, he's an uncontrolled animal!
[02:54:01.440 --> 02:54:02.701]  He's out of control.
[02:54:02.741 --> 02:54:07.505]  He can't even control himself enough to say, my relationship to power and authority is that I'm all for it.
[02:54:07.965 --> 02:54:09.586]  People need somebody to watch over them.
[02:54:10.107 --> 02:54:13.409]  95% of the people in the world need to be told what to do and how to behave.
[02:54:13.970 --> 02:54:24.618]  And this is who they're selling us, and I go on California stations and act like I'm a devil because I am covering all this, but the people are all on my side.
[02:54:25.078 --> 02:54:27.300]  We have them just cramming this down our throat.
[02:54:29.662 --> 02:54:30.122]  Anything else?
[02:54:31.355 --> 02:54:33.237]  Not to mention the conditioning.
[02:54:33.397 --> 02:54:34.778]  I'm 23 years old.
[02:54:34.858 --> 02:54:38.522]  I was 12 when Terminator 2 came out.
[02:54:38.562 --> 02:54:41.606]  That was my hero growing up.
[02:54:41.986 --> 02:54:46.131]  When you actually do grow up, as a lot of people don't, you learn all this stuff.
[02:54:46.191 --> 02:54:48.373]  It plays with your mind.
[02:54:48.433 --> 02:54:52.738]  One minute you're a child of a hero, the next minute you're your enemy, I suppose.
[02:54:54.227 --> 02:54:55.027]  I hear you, my friend.
[02:54:55.047 --> 02:54:55.828]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:56.528 --> 02:54:58.008]  I'm sorry to John in Colorado.
[02:54:58.028 --> 02:54:59.008]  We're just flat out of time.
[02:54:59.048 --> 02:55:00.969]  Don't have time to go until you call me back tomorrow.
[02:55:00.989 --> 02:55:05.810]  11 to 2 Central, back to 9, 9 to midnight on the AM and FM dial in your area.

[02:55:13.393 --> 02:55:17.214]  Please email your friends, your family, your neighbors, talk show hosts.
[02:55:17.674 --> 02:55:21.535]  We've been ignored by national television other than CNN, who they've had that lady back on.
[02:55:22.606 --> 02:55:25.288]  Email CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC.
[02:55:25.308 --> 02:55:27.409]  Tell them, hey, we're 80% of the people.
[02:55:27.449 --> 02:55:28.349]  We don't want this.
[02:55:28.910 --> 02:55:30.211]  Have Alex Jones on.
[02:55:31.471 --> 02:55:32.972]  Stop it.
[02:55:33.012 --> 02:55:36.274]  Have Alex Jones or somebody else on to expose this guy.
[02:55:36.534 --> 02:55:37.795]  Please help us spread the word.
[02:55:37.815 --> 02:55:42.218]  Help get that URL out to people, to the 3 million people that have visited in the last four days.
[02:55:42.298 --> 02:55:42.738]  Thank you.

[02:56:13.599 --> 02:56:14.060]  Oh, boy.
[02:56:14.340 --> 02:56:17.863]  I'll be back on the network tonight, filling in for Pastor Butch Paw, 8 to 9 Central.
[02:56:18.784 --> 02:56:28.013]  You'll hear me all over Radio Land doing interviews, battling it one state at a time, trying to warn people of this outlander, this foreigner, this usurper who wants you to be his slave.
[02:56:29.554 --> 02:56:31.056]  All right, get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:31.076 --> 02:56:33.438]  God bless, and check out prisonplanet.tv.
[02:56:36.181 --> 02:56:36.661]  Hello, folks.
