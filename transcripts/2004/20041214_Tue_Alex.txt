[00:00.000 --> 00:07.680]  for a massive broadcast lined up for you today. We'll get into the latest death numbers of
[00:07.680 --> 00:15.120]  our troops in Iraq, new scandals concerning torture not just in Iraq but also Afghanistan,
[00:16.400 --> 00:25.280]  the Fed to raise interest rates, what's happening with the economy. But a large portion of the
[00:25.280 --> 00:31.200]  broadcast, we also have Paul Watson joining us in an hour and a half to cover the worldwide news
[00:31.200 --> 00:39.120]  and to give us his news analysis. It's always excellent, but in the first hour and a half
[00:39.120 --> 00:47.760]  we're going to predominantly focus on Pulitzer Prize winning author, researcher, San Jose
[00:47.760 --> 00:56.960]  Mercury reporter Gary Webb who we now have gotten the details. The police report all of it. He was
[00:56.960 --> 01:04.720]  shot in the face with a shotgun, clearly murdered. Oh, but conveniently the police say it was a
[01:04.720 --> 01:10.560]  suicide. Well, since we learned of this yesterday morning and the world learned of it yesterday
[01:10.560 --> 01:19.440]  morning that he had been killed in his home the night before the morning before. Since we learned
[01:19.440 --> 01:28.880]  of this, I've talked to Sally Castillo. I have talked to Chico Brown who was Freeray Ricky Ross's
[01:30.240 --> 01:37.840]  one of his top business partners. Freeray Ricky Ross, the biggest drug dealer on the West Coast
[01:37.840 --> 01:44.080]  for the CIA. And you see, I'm one of the few people that's interviewed Freeray Ricky Ross,
[01:44.080 --> 01:52.560]  not on this radio show, but for an upcoming film that I'm involved in called American Drug War.
[01:54.080 --> 01:59.760]  Well, last night the producer of the film called Freeray Ricky Ross in the federal prison he's
[01:59.760 --> 02:08.240]  in in the Panhandle of Texas up near Good Old Tulia where he's not allowed to have interviews. Even
[02:08.240 --> 02:13.760]  Texas Monthly has trouble getting into scene. And I've interviewed him over the phone before
[02:13.760 --> 02:21.920]  from there for the film. And he learned from Kevin Booth, the producer of American Drug War,
[02:21.920 --> 02:30.240]  that Gary had recently been telling him that he was on the new information concerning the CIA
[02:30.240 --> 02:36.640]  and drug trafficking. And that men, he pulled up to his house and two men were up on his balcony.
[02:37.600 --> 02:43.360]  Two special forces types. They jumped off the balcony and ran away. He was being followed. He
[02:43.360 --> 02:52.880]  was being threatened. But the police, of course, will say it is all suicide. Just like Princess
[02:52.880 --> 02:58.640]  Diana says, they're going to kill me in the next few months. They've told me in a fake automobile
[02:58.640 --> 03:05.280]  accident, that's how they're going to kill me. They killed my lover. They murdered him. Now they've
[03:05.280 --> 03:14.160]  said they're going to kill me. Or Dr. David Kelly, whistleblower, says if I don't shut up,
[03:14.160 --> 03:17.600]  they're going to kill me and I'll be found dead in the woods. Told two different colleagues that
[03:17.600 --> 03:24.720]  have gone public. Mainstream news, but again, back of the paper. We're not going to let the memory
[03:24.720 --> 03:29.280]  of Gary Webb go down in some type of shame like he committed suicide.
[03:29.280 --> 03:39.760]  But this is unbelievable. But it's par for the course with what we've seen. Police officers
[03:39.760 --> 03:46.800]  that expose Oklahoma City get stabbed 13 times and have their throat slit and have torture marks
[03:46.800 --> 03:51.920]  and handcuffed marks on them. It goes on and on. We're tired of it. I mean, they got medical
[03:51.920 --> 03:57.360]  examiners that will say, well, you've got severed limbs and torture marks head to toe.
[03:57.360 --> 04:10.880]  And they'll say, oh, suicide, Arkansas. Gary Webb, unrecognizable, face blown off. By the way,
[04:10.880 --> 04:16.640]  a shotgun doesn't do that up close. Has to be at least a few feet away. That's how the pattern
[04:16.640 --> 04:25.120]  works. They blew his face off and then put this note on the front door. We'll be right back. Stay
[04:25.120 --> 04:32.800]  with us. Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, police state three total enslavement.
[04:32.800 --> 04:37.440]  Police state three details the architecture goals and operations of the new world order.
[04:37.440 --> 04:43.200]  There is a chance to use this disaster with a new world order. The new world order.
[04:44.960 --> 04:49.440]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government sponsored terrorism worldwide. We
[04:49.440 --> 04:54.240]  ripped the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance
[04:54.240 --> 04:59.840]  of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty. You will lose your liberty. Homeland security,
[04:59.840 --> 05:04.560]  executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the total information society,
[05:04.560 --> 05:08.560]  the pan American union, federal gun grabs, government run, white slavery rings and much,
[05:08.560 --> 05:12.400]  much more. If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two and a

[05:28.000 --> 05:32.800]  Hello folks. Alex Jones here. You know, murky water filters have been removing pathogenic
[05:32.800 --> 05:36.640]  bacteria for years. But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your
[05:36.640 --> 05:40.960]  water? The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically
[05:40.960 --> 05:45.280]  increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants. Best of all, they filter much
[05:45.280 --> 05:49.600]  faster than ordinary gravity elements. This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[05:49.600 --> 05:54.480]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cyst and parasites, but also remove
[05:54.480 --> 05:59.920]  trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as atrazine, benzene, chloride and chloroform,
[05:59.920 --> 06:06.080]  mtbe, radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates and unwanted heavy
[06:06.080 --> 06:10.960]  metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum are extracted. Supercharge your gravity filter today
[06:10.960 --> 06:15.840]  and order a two pack of black murky purification elements for only $96 or a four pack for only
[06:15.840 --> 06:24.080]  175 by calling new millennium at triple eight 803-4438. That's triple eight 803-4438. Or order

[06:32.640 --> 06:37.120]  natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach? Hundreds of people report improved
[06:37.120 --> 06:42.240]  health and wellness using Reif frequency technology. In the 1920s, research scientist
[06:42.240 --> 06:47.440]  Royal Raymond Reif discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[06:47.440 --> 06:52.560]  The biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain
[06:52.560 --> 06:57.520]  and disease conditions. There are no side effects. Join others in discovering a return to natural
[06:57.520 --> 07:03.440]  health and wellness. Eliminate the cause. Don't just treat symptoms. Biosolutions has over 450
[07:03.440 --> 07:08.560]  preprogrammed auto sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use. It comes
[07:08.560 --> 07:13.360]  with a 30 day return policy and a one year limited warranty. For more information call

[07:25.760 --> 07:34.880]  call today. From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war
[07:34.880 --> 07:44.320]  continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. So the award-winning, the award-winning
[07:44.320 --> 07:56.720]  Pulitzer prize winner, author of the best selling book, Dark Alliance CIA Drugs series,
[07:56.720 --> 08:05.120]  dead of reported suicide shot in the face with a shotgun. Now it was a little more obvious when
[08:05.120 --> 08:09.520]  people would commit suicide with two gunshots to the back of the head, which is kind of hard
[08:09.520 --> 08:13.200]  to get the rifle to the back of your head and then it's impossible basically to shoot yourself
[08:13.200 --> 08:25.360]  twice in the back of the head. But we have now learned some new developments. I have interviewed
[08:25.360 --> 08:37.920]  Ricky Ross, Freeway Ricky Ross, who was selling $25 million worth of cocaine a day.
[08:37.920 --> 08:46.880]  $25 million of cocaine a day in California distributing across the West.
[08:48.640 --> 08:54.400]  Openly taking delivery from the Central Intelligence Agency.
[08:58.640 --> 09:05.120]  And Gary Webb won the Pulitzer prize. Then the media, the establishment,
[09:05.120 --> 09:12.000]  tried to discredit him. He was successful in disproving their claims. He had just recently
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.120]  been able to disprove everything they were saying and had been vindicated.
[09:16.880 --> 09:23.920]  And he had recently told Freeway Ricky Ross via telephone in his federal jail cell
[09:25.520 --> 09:31.760]  in North Texas that there were men up on his balcony when he pulled up at home jumping off
[09:31.760 --> 09:39.360]  and running off, that he was being followed, that he was being threatened. And then he supposedly
[09:39.360 --> 09:45.040]  shoots himself in the face with a shotgun. He was moving. He had movers coming to his house, was
[09:45.040 --> 09:51.200]  moving. And just had a divorce. That's when the CIA likes to strike. So they have the
[09:51.200 --> 09:58.400]  convenient narrative, the story. Oh, he was depressed. And then he just shot himself in the
[09:58.400 --> 10:06.240]  face with a shotgun. And again, I'll repeat it. Just yesterday, big British newspapers,
[10:06.240 --> 10:12.560]  several of them, had the headlines with the British paramedics that came to the scene of Dr. David
[10:12.560 --> 10:20.160]  Kelly. The former head of the biological weapons program, important down, then the head British
[10:20.160 --> 10:27.600]  UN envoy to the inspectors saying that it wasn't true. Saddam couldn't hit England in 45 minutes.
[10:28.400 --> 10:32.720]  Notice with chemical or biological weapons that there weren't any weapons of mass destruction.
[10:34.320 --> 10:38.880]  He then told an American and a British colleague, they're going to kill me. I'm going to be found
[10:38.880 --> 10:45.200]  dead in the woods if I don't shut up. And then he's found dead in the woods with three undigested
[10:45.200 --> 10:50.720]  sleeping pills. They wouldn't have killed him, by the way, would have taken dozens. They're undigested.
[10:50.720 --> 10:56.320]  Somebody put him down his throat. Undigested sitting in his belly, sitting in his stomach
[10:57.680 --> 11:03.200]  with almost no blood at the scene. He supposedly died by slitting his own wrist.
[11:04.320 --> 11:09.440]  And there's almost no blood at the scene. And one of the local constables when they were out
[11:09.440 --> 11:13.760]  looking for him because he'd come up missing the night before that morning when they came upon
[11:13.760 --> 11:19.920]  the body from about a hundred yards, they described seeing men in black uniforms who looked like
[11:19.920 --> 11:27.760]  military men, you know, the short haircut muscular. And then they walked off from the dead body
[11:27.760 --> 11:33.920]  and the constable went up there and didn't chase them. Obviously intimidated by them.
[11:33.920 --> 11:40.640]  And then they called in the police and oh, it's a suicide. Men with shaved short hair cuts
[11:40.640 --> 11:46.800]  standing around the body. No blood to speak of, the paramedics said. Tells people they're going
[11:46.800 --> 11:51.600]  to kill me and put me in the woods. I mean, what more do you need? A videotape of them killing him?
[11:55.680 --> 12:01.840]  Princess Diana, months before her death, says they're going to kill me. They've told me
[12:02.560 --> 12:08.320]  Charles is going to kill me in a fake auto accident. This is mainstream. This,
[12:08.320 --> 12:15.840]  this, that they're going to kill me in a fake auto accident. And then a few months later,
[12:16.720 --> 12:25.600]  when she's pregnant with the shopping mall tycoon's child, the British royals weren't
[12:25.600 --> 12:28.960]  about let her be pregnant by anybody who wasn't royal, much less an Arab.
[12:31.600 --> 12:36.960]  Very upset about that. Think of the scandal. She thought she could just rebel and do whatever
[12:36.960 --> 12:41.760]  she wanted to, you know, get back at them. Didn't work that way. Her car, her Mercedes,
[12:41.760 --> 12:47.520]  gets stolen the week before. And when it gets returned, all detailed nice. No questions asked.
[12:47.520 --> 12:50.560]  Her security detail just says, oh, it got returned. We'll just take it.
[12:52.640 --> 12:56.960]  Wonder why. And then the cameras all turn off two minutes before the wreck.
[13:00.080 --> 13:06.720]  And then it plows into the pillar, the underground tunnel. And then they sit there for an hour.
[13:06.720 --> 13:11.840]  The paramedics just sit there and you see the surveillance cameras and they turn back on her,
[13:11.840 --> 13:15.200]  her legs moving and twitching and it looks like people are inside holding her down.
[13:15.200 --> 13:20.320]  And she has a little problem and she gets loaded in the ambulance. They drive 25 miles an hour for
[13:20.320 --> 13:25.200]  another 45 minutes and she dies at the hospital. Hey, right as she gets there.
[13:29.040 --> 13:35.360]  Oh, no, she wasn't killed. I mean, people can say they're going to kill me. They can specifically
[13:35.360 --> 13:42.640]  say how they're going to die. They can name who is going to kill them. And then when they're murdered,
[13:43.200 --> 13:47.120]  the authorities say, oh, no, it was an accident or it was a suicide.
[13:51.600 --> 13:56.960]  This is unbelievable. And the cowards in the media and the cowardly police and the
[13:56.960 --> 14:00.960]  cowardly medical examiners, they just go and rubber stamp it. They've got a problem though,
[14:00.960 --> 14:06.560]  because the paramedics in the Kelly case are saying, no, this guy had been brought there.
[14:07.520 --> 14:13.680]  You know, we've seen what happens. People slit their wrist. There's blood. There's blood, you know.
[14:17.200 --> 14:21.440]  They got a problem with saying all the voice recorders and data recorders were destroyed at
[14:21.440 --> 14:25.360]  the World Trade Center site because firefighters are going public and saying it's all a fraud.
[14:25.360 --> 14:30.400]  And by the way, the FBI threatened us. They got a problem. Some people got courage. Some people
[14:30.400 --> 14:36.080]  speak up. Some people get involved. Some people have spinal cords and aren't jellyfish.
[14:39.200 --> 14:43.360]  And I'm not going to stand here and let them smirch the memory of people they kill,
[14:43.360 --> 14:52.400]  like Dr. Kelly and Gary Webb. I'm not going to sit here and watch these heroes fall and then not
[14:52.400 --> 15:00.800]  give them their due. Gary Webb deserves to be buried in Arlington Cemetery with a monument there
[15:00.800 --> 15:08.160]  for standing up and never backing down. And I know they've got patriotic cemeteries in England.
[15:08.160 --> 15:12.640]  Dr. David Kelly deserves to be buried there. We're doing what's right.
[15:12.640 --> 15:20.800]  I'm not going to sit here and let them claim they commit suicide when it's not true.
[15:23.680 --> 15:29.360]  And again, I will never commit suicide. I've never thought of committing suicide.
[15:29.360 --> 15:34.560]  I would never want to commit suicide. Nothing would happen in my life that would make me commit
[15:34.560 --> 15:48.160]  suicide. So don't you, if they kill me, ever let the media say I committed suicide. I'm sick of it.
[15:51.280 --> 15:57.040]  And again, they have old technology. Even the highway departments come out.
[15:58.320 --> 16:03.040]  Federal transportation offices come out and say, oh, yeah, we can remote control cars perfectly.
[16:03.040 --> 16:09.760]  And why in the future we may even make it to where your cars are controlled as you drive down the road
[16:10.320 --> 16:15.120]  or where there's little sensors on your car. And if there's an emergency, we can remote control
[16:15.120 --> 16:20.480]  and take control of your car that will keep you from running into other cars or any type of
[16:20.480 --> 16:25.120]  obstructions. Covered that about a year ago when it came out off the government's own website.
[16:25.120 --> 16:30.160]  It's old technology. So the car, Diana's car gets stolen a week before, gets brought back
[16:30.160 --> 16:40.000]  detailed and her own security doesn't even, her own royal security just, oh, it was stolen when
[16:40.000 --> 16:44.720]  it was returned. Let's just put you in it. And so the driver gets in there and everybody describes
[16:44.720 --> 16:54.720]  it as the car just suddenly veers right into the 13th pillar.
[16:54.720 --> 17:04.240]  In fact, it did it over 100 yards early. It isn't like it just suddenly veered. The car's driving
[17:04.240 --> 17:12.320]  and it just veers perfectly and stays in a perfect line and hits straight on dead center
[17:12.320 --> 17:19.120]  into that pylon. Clearly, it was remote control. Then it turns out the driver was not on drugs,
[17:19.120 --> 17:26.640]  was not drunk, was not on pills. Those toxicology reports are out public.
[17:28.240 --> 17:32.480]  But boy, when you ever hear of somebody in a car, wasn't stuck in the car, it was just the
[17:32.480 --> 17:36.640]  front of the car was smashed. When you ever heard of somebody, them just leaving somebody for an
[17:36.640 --> 17:40.160]  hour in the car, there's the video of her legs flopping as they're leaning in over.
[17:42.160 --> 17:46.640]  They're going to kill me in a fake auto accident. Charles is going to kill me soon.
[17:46.640 --> 17:56.240]  He told me. Oh, the police. Oh, no, he's not a suspect. No, because you can't be a suspect. He's
[17:56.240 --> 18:04.160]  your royal, isn't he? No, royals never kill their families, never kill their wives.
[18:05.680 --> 18:08.400]  They never smothered the twins in the tower and
[18:08.400 --> 18:15.840]  killed them. Henry VIII didn't kill five of his wives and their heads chopped off. No, they never
[18:15.840 --> 18:24.640]  do that. It never happens. I don't know when it doesn't happen. That's court entry. No, it's
[18:24.640 --> 18:28.800]  impossible. It's ridiculous. Royals do not have other royals killed when they're pregnant with
[18:28.800 --> 18:36.480]  Arabs children. I'm sure Prince Charles was happy and he was just going to let a foreigner
[18:36.480 --> 18:40.160]  impregnate his wife. And again, I'm not saying anything wrong with that. I'm saying they weren't
[18:40.160 --> 18:48.240]  going to put up with that. But Gary Webb, ladies and gentlemen, new developments. And this was
[18:48.240 --> 18:53.520]  recorded, by the way. I talked to Kevin Booth last night right before he was making the American
[18:53.520 --> 18:59.120]  Drug War film and I'm narrating and hosting. Big production. Been in production for a year.
[18:59.120 --> 19:09.120]  I mean, production for another year. And he was going to call, forget the call, his weekly call
[19:09.120 --> 19:16.240]  from Premier Ricky Ross in prison where Gary Webb got a lot of his information. And when he called
[19:16.240 --> 19:21.200]  him, he didn't know that Gary died and that was all caught on tape. We'll air that tomorrow,
[19:21.200 --> 19:25.440]  perhaps even in the third hour today, if Kevin's able to get back to his office and do it. But he
[19:25.440 --> 19:32.640]  will be joining us in the next segment from the road. Hi, folks. Jack Browner from Midas Resources,
[19:32.640 --> 19:42.800]  the real money folks. Let's review a few things from the past year, November 2003 to November 2004.
[19:42.800 --> 19:50.080]  The dollars ranged from 9,800 to 10,300, a 5% increase. The dollar's value has dropped from

[23:41.920 --> 23:51.280]  All right, we've got some big breaking news for you and we're going to be posting this on prisonplanet.com.
[23:52.000 --> 23:56.880]  Later this afternoon, we definitely need our great listeners to make a transcript of this
[23:56.880 --> 24:03.680]  interview from this point on. Kevin Booth is a documentary filmmaker. He's been working for the
[24:03.680 --> 24:11.680]  last year on a film titled American Drug War. In the websites americandrugwar.com, the film
[24:11.680 --> 24:16.400]  will be coming out in about a year. He's interviewed basically everybody under the sun concerning the
[24:16.400 --> 24:23.520]  history of the drug war, who really controls the drug trade. I am the narrator of the film and the
[24:23.520 --> 24:29.520]  host of it. I have been involved in some interviews with Ricky Ross, known as Freeray Ricky Ross,
[24:29.520 --> 24:35.200]  the biggest public drug dealer, that is the biggest known drug dealer in West Coast history,
[24:35.920 --> 24:43.440]  upwards of in some days, $25 million worth of dealing going on to link directly back to the CIA.
[24:43.440 --> 24:50.720]  He was one of the main sources for Gary Webb, the Pulitzer Prize winning author of the book
[24:50.720 --> 24:58.640]  Dark Alliance CIA Drug Series in the San Jose Mercury News. And then, of course, he then wrote the best
[24:58.640 --> 25:04.640]  selling book, Dark Alliance. He was shotgunned in the face, something that the major newspapers
[25:04.640 --> 25:12.240]  aren't reporting, but I have this from direct sources in Sacramento and some of Gary's best friends
[25:12.240 --> 25:20.640]  and associates. It's just unbelievable. He was shotgunned in the face and then movers who were
[25:20.640 --> 25:25.920]  coming to the house found a note on the door saying, don't come in, call 911, call an ambulance.
[25:25.920 --> 25:32.160]  Yesterday, Kevin called me and again, we've interviewed Ricky in the past. He said, Ricky's
[25:32.160 --> 25:36.640]  scheduled to call me tonight at 1030 because you can't call him at the federal prison he's in.
[25:36.640 --> 25:42.880]  They've moved him there from Victorville, Florida. Excuse me. Scratch that from Victorville,
[25:42.880 --> 25:46.640]  Northern California from that prison in Northern California
[25:48.800 --> 25:51.840]  in Southern California. And again, we'll scratch that out of the transcript,
[25:51.840 --> 25:58.800]  trying to get all these facts together. Victorville in Southern California to the Panhandle of Texas,
[25:58.800 --> 26:06.400]  North Texas, where they do not let media in to interview Mr. Ross. So we've been doing it over
[26:06.400 --> 26:15.200]  the telephone. Kevin Booth was able to get the call last night and had the unfortunate job of
[26:15.200 --> 26:23.360]  breaking the news to Freeway Ricky Ross that Gary Webb had died from gunshot wound to the head,
[26:23.360 --> 26:31.840]  to the face, in very questionable circumstances. And now Kevin can reveal to us what Gary Webb
[26:31.840 --> 26:38.880]  via telephone had recently told Freeway Ricky Ross. Kevin Booth. Hey, Alex. We've got about
[26:38.880 --> 26:43.120]  three minutes before we hit break. Just tell folks basically who Freeway Ricky is and what
[26:43.120 --> 26:48.000]  happened in the conversation last night. Well, I guess, you know, like you said, Ricky Ross was,
[26:48.880 --> 26:55.600]  he just became known as the biggest crack dealer in West Coast history. The name Freeway came from
[26:55.600 --> 27:00.560]  the fact that he was buying up so much real estate along the Harbor Freeway in Los Angeles.
[27:01.280 --> 27:08.480]  And when he finally got put away the second time, he didn't know that the CIA was behind,
[27:08.480 --> 27:13.600]  you know, allowing him to become so big. I mean, basically, it's not like CIA agents
[27:13.600 --> 27:18.000]  were like supplying cocaine. It's more like he just couldn't believe he never got caught. And
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.480]  he couldn't believe how low the prices were. And he couldn't believe how just easy it all was.
[27:22.480 --> 27:28.000]  Well, people, I mean, in the Dark Alliance series and talking to Ricky, they had a go-between,
[27:28.000 --> 27:34.320]  but it was Contras directly shelling him. And then the Contras flying back were all part of the
[27:34.320 --> 27:40.080]  CIA operation. Right. It was all, yeah, all these big cartels. And so, you know, like you said,
[27:40.080 --> 27:48.240]  I mean, he was in the Victorville prison and right above Los Angeles there. And, you know,
[27:48.240 --> 27:55.440]  the last time he spoke to Gary, which wasn't that long ago, you know, he told me that Gary
[27:55.440 --> 27:59.680]  was still working on the story, that this was the kind of thing that Gary was never going to give
[27:59.680 --> 28:05.200]  up on because Gary felt like he could just keep going with this forever and uncover more and
[28:05.200 --> 28:10.400]  more people and exposing more names. And but he did tell me that Gary knew he was being followed.
[28:10.400 --> 28:13.760]  Every time he drove somewhere, there was always cars following him around. He said he knew it was
[28:13.760 --> 28:19.440]  government people. Several times he came home. It was an apartment, a two-story apartment late at
[28:19.440 --> 28:24.720]  night. And a guy would come shimmying down like a drainage pipe, you know, off of his balcony.
[28:24.720 --> 28:27.840]  And, you know, you could tell it wasn't a burglar. I mean, it was obviously somebody
[28:27.840 --> 28:31.760]  probably in his apartment rummaging around looking at documents or looking at his computer.
[28:31.760 --> 28:36.000]  And we talked off air. It was described as kind of a special forces type, you know,
[28:36.000 --> 28:43.040]  really fast going down the pipe. Yeah, definitely. And, you know,
[28:43.680 --> 28:50.160]  so onto like the whole suicide angle of the story, I mean, it's kind of like they did
[28:50.160 --> 28:55.680]  stuff to kind of freak him out, to intimidate him, to push him to actually being depressed.
[28:55.680 --> 28:59.440]  But I mean, everybody I've spoken to, Ricky included, said there's no way,
[28:59.440 --> 29:03.760]  you know, that this guy would have taken his life. But he enjoyed life. He loved his kids.
[29:04.640 --> 29:10.800]  He was excited about the future. And, you know, people of South Central LA saw Gary Webb as a
[29:10.800 --> 29:14.160]  godsend. He was... We'll be right back, Kevin. We got a break. Stay with us.
[29:14.160 --> 29:25.280]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[31:30.560 --> 31:35.600]  aware or not, World War III has started. Let me rephrase that. Oil War III has started.
[31:35.600 --> 31:40.000]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil. Now we are looking at the possibility of
[31:40.000 --> 31:44.880]  invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia. Why else would the U.S. be building 13 permanent military
[31:44.880 --> 31:49.120]  installations inside Iraq? Does it look like we're pulling out? The nations of the earth
[31:49.120 --> 31:53.600]  are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing. At this rate of
[31:53.600 --> 31:58.560]  consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up. Ready reserves prepare to

[32:41.680 --> 32:47.840]  Coming up in a few minutes, we'll be talking to Sally Castillo. Of course, the top DEA agent in
[32:47.840 --> 32:56.560]  Latin America, Central and South America, who was eyewitness to masses of drug deals by the CIA
[32:56.560 --> 33:02.480]  and by the Contras and another one of Gary Webb's sources, the Pulitzer Prize winning
[33:02.480 --> 33:07.360]  author of the Dark Alliance series and the San Jose Mercury news, then wrote the best-selling
[33:07.360 --> 33:14.720]  book, Dark Alliance, CIA drug trafficking. And the new developments, Kevin Booth, again, who's
[33:14.720 --> 33:19.040]  been interviewing, talked to him last night. I've interviewed him for the film as well,
[33:20.320 --> 33:29.200]  talking to Freeway Ricky Ross, who was the person who was supplied with CIA cocaine and the biggest
[33:29.200 --> 33:36.000]  known drug dealer in West Coast history. Tens of millions of dollars a day going on for years and
[33:36.000 --> 33:42.720]  was absolutely untouchable, one of the major sources for the Dark Alliance piece. Kevin broke
[33:42.720 --> 33:51.840]  the news to Freeway Ricky, Ricky Ross, last night. And describe for us, Kevin, before we get back
[33:51.840 --> 33:58.720]  into the people that were rummaging through and up on his balcony and following Gary Webb around
[33:58.720 --> 34:04.720]  according to Ricky Ross, how did Ricky take it when you described it to him? I know we're going to
[34:04.720 --> 34:10.960]  be able to play that on the air, but you weren't at your office when I called you for this broadcast
[34:10.960 --> 34:16.880]  this morning, and so we're not going to be able to have that until tomorrow. But Kevin, describe
[34:16.880 --> 34:24.480]  that discussion for us. Oh, he took it really bad, you know? I mean, he thought of Ricky as a,
[34:24.480 --> 34:32.080]  I mean, he thought of, he thought of him as like a godsend and that, you know, this guy,
[34:33.440 --> 34:40.240]  Gary, put his life on the line to expose this story and that, you know, that he just thought it
[34:40.240 --> 34:44.000]  was really depressing and really just really made him sad. And he said a lot of the guys there in
[34:44.000 --> 34:49.120]  jail who are familiar with the story and a lot of people are going to be sad. I mean, you know,
[34:50.640 --> 34:57.520]  when he came out with that story, a lot of people in South Central just kind of had a wake-up call
[34:57.520 --> 35:03.440]  and it just all rang so true to them. And, you know, one of the crazy parts of the story too is
[35:03.440 --> 35:09.520]  that, like I said, I mean, Ricky wasn't, he wasn't even aware of all this until he got put in prison
[35:09.520 --> 35:16.160]  and Gary Webb came out to try to help him with his case. And that's when all this evidence started
[35:16.160 --> 35:20.640]  becoming uncovered. And it was just, just like with me working on the film, but the drug war,
[35:20.640 --> 35:25.120]  it's just like one thing leads to another. It just never ends. So you talk to one person,
[35:25.120 --> 35:29.680]  they lead you to another, and he just kept following this chain and the chain, you know,
[35:29.680 --> 35:34.640]  just because he finished that one book, it just never stops. So my question to Ricky was like,
[35:34.640 --> 35:39.520]  well, why was it, you know, the book is already out, everybody knows all this stuff, so why kill him now?
[35:40.800 --> 35:46.080]  It was just a revenge thing. He said, absolutely not because Gary was still hot on the trail
[35:46.720 --> 35:53.200]  and he was never going to give up on this thing. And he had just recently been vindicated. The
[35:53.200 --> 36:01.600]  establishment media had been trying to attack him with ham-fisted attacks, but it wasn't working.
[36:01.600 --> 36:06.320]  And he had just, as of late, brought out a lot of new evidence. He had been vindicated. That
[36:06.320 --> 36:11.920]  was starting to come out in the news. He was still on the trail. That had been reported on.
[36:11.920 --> 36:18.240]  Now, Selly Castillo is joining us right now, Kevin, and he may not be aware of this new
[36:18.240 --> 36:27.680]  development. When you talked to Ricky Ross last night for Selly, please repeat what Ricky told
[36:27.680 --> 36:32.960]  you Gary told him about people at his apartment and about being followed.
[36:34.080 --> 36:38.640]  Well, yeah, he just, he knew that he was being followed all the time. And there are several
[36:38.640 --> 36:43.520]  instances where he would come home after, you know, working all day at late at night,
[36:44.160 --> 36:49.600]  and he would see a guy shimmy down like that. He had a drain pipe that went up to the balcony on
[36:49.600 --> 36:55.600]  the second floor apartment. And these guys that were definitely not burglars would like come shimmying
[36:55.600 --> 37:01.200]  down the pole really fast and just, you know, disappear. And he was pretty confident that
[37:01.200 --> 37:04.240]  that they're up there rummaging through documents, looking at his computer.
[37:04.240 --> 37:06.960]  What was the term? And again, we're going to air this interview.
[37:08.880 --> 37:14.000]  But Kevin, what was the term he used to describe them? I mean, why did he think that they weren't
[37:14.000 --> 37:20.560]  just regular burglars? I believe you described it as, as it was just so professional how they did
[37:20.560 --> 37:25.440]  it. It's so professional. What Ricky said, he just, he just said that Gary said they were definitely
[37:25.440 --> 37:29.120]  government. That's, that's all, you know, that's all he's told me. So I'm not going to put words
[37:29.120 --> 37:33.200]  in his mouth, but he, he just said they were, that Gary had said these are definitely government
[37:33.200 --> 37:38.320]  people. You know, I mean, he's been, so that was the term he used was definitely government people.
[37:38.320 --> 37:44.880]  Yes. Unbelievable. Anything else he told you during this interview? I mean, I've been doing
[37:44.880 --> 37:49.360]  interviews before with you with Ricky and he only gets about 15 minutes and then the prison cuts
[37:49.360 --> 37:53.200]  him off. This is the only way we're allowed to interview him. They don't really let the media
[37:53.200 --> 37:57.120]  end the interview. I mean, you've actually had to contact lawyers and have started proceedings
[37:57.120 --> 38:00.880]  concerning that because they're not supposed to be able to do that. Well, yeah, another,
[38:00.880 --> 38:06.080]  another part of the story I didn't know about was that, you know, after Chico and Ricky had gotten
[38:06.080 --> 38:11.280]  arrested at that time, I guess there was some production company in New York that wanted to,
[38:11.280 --> 38:19.360]  that was trying to buy the rights to do like a film about this and the DEA rated their office
[38:19.360 --> 38:26.480]  and confiscated everything. Some big like film company in New York and definitely put an end to
[38:26.480 --> 38:31.360]  any thoughts that these guys are going to make a movie about. Yeah, this would blow Scarface,
[38:31.360 --> 38:37.040]  which is based on some real characters out of the water. I mean, this is a film that needs to be
[38:37.040 --> 38:44.800]  made. And so that's another big piece of this. Anything they can to try to stop it. And Kevin,
[38:44.800 --> 38:50.160]  I know that you're out taking care of errands right now. I hope that you can try. Let's be
[38:50.160 --> 38:54.000]  honest. I called Kevin this morning. He's out on the green belt, beautiful weather here down by
[38:54.000 --> 39:01.600]  the river, walking his, his two dogs. But Kevin, do you think you can get back to your office and
[39:01.600 --> 39:07.440]  get that queued up by the end of the show? I'll try to. If you can't, it's okay. We can. I don't
[39:07.440 --> 39:11.680]  know how to play it over the phone, though. You can figure it out. You could, I think you can
[39:13.280 --> 39:16.960]  plug it into your, we'll just try to figure out if you can't, we can get it over here and get it
[39:16.960 --> 39:22.080]  uploaded to the computer tonight and try to get it or put it on the web and high bandwidth and we
[39:22.080 --> 39:27.280]  can download it and stream it that way. This needs to get out immediately for Gary. Kevin, I want
[39:27.280 --> 39:35.440]  to bring up Selly Castile. Now, Selly, again, was the top DEA agent. He's been all over the big
[39:35.440 --> 39:41.360]  national TV shows, far and television. We've interviewed him many times. He's come to Austin
[39:41.360 --> 39:46.720]  and, and, and showed the pictures of the CIA drug dealers. He shows us the connection to Latin
[39:46.720 --> 39:54.000]  America, how that coupled through to people like freeway Ricky Ross and the direct connection of
[39:54.000 --> 40:01.600]  the CIA and these conduits to people like freeway Ricky Ross and the LAPD protecting Ricky Ross and
[40:01.600 --> 40:07.280]  other top drug dealers. Selly, was this a new development for you to learn that Kevin talked
[40:07.280 --> 40:12.640]  to freeway Ricky and found out that he had told freeway Ricky that he'd had men at his house and
[40:12.640 --> 40:20.000]  things? I've heard something to that effect, but I wasn't very sure on it what actually did happen.
[40:20.000 --> 40:26.400]  But my whole point to this issue is the fact that you gotta remember one thing. Nobody's ever done
[40:27.360 --> 40:32.080]  a movie or a documentary on the Iran contra investigation which involved the
[40:32.720 --> 40:39.280]  CIA involving drug trafficking. Now, Gary Webb at one point pointed to the assets
[40:39.920 --> 40:44.800]  that were heavily involved and I myself pointed to actually the CIA officials
[40:45.680 --> 40:49.680]  who were actually participating in loading and unloading and refueling the planes.
[40:49.680 --> 40:53.760]  You came to Austin and did a two-hour presentation and showed photos of them,
[40:53.760 --> 40:58.640]  documents, everything. Yeah, I got another hundred set of slides I'm going to bring over to Kevin
[40:58.640 --> 41:04.560]  Booth who he can put them on and those slides do have the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[41:05.680 --> 41:10.320]  For people that don't know who you are in a nutshell, tell us what you did and why you went
[41:10.320 --> 41:16.800]  public. Describe what you saw in Latin America. Well, you gotta remember one thing. I am not
[41:16.800 --> 41:20.640]  an individual who comes up from the left or from the right, but I was
[41:21.280 --> 41:27.520]  reared as a very patriotic family, coming from a very patriotic family and we all served our
[41:27.520 --> 41:32.160]  country and so forth. And when I joined the DEA, I thought that by putting my life on the line
[41:32.160 --> 41:36.800]  that I would make a difference. But it was there in Central America in my six years that I realized
[41:37.440 --> 41:43.520]  that we were the enemy. We were sleeping with the enemy. We were involving drug trafficking and
[41:43.520 --> 41:52.320]  when I tried to expose the whole issue, I remember Randy Capster, CIA official, saying to me,
[41:52.320 --> 41:55.760]  you know, nobody's going to listen to you. You know, we've been doing this for years and nobody's
[41:55.760 --> 42:01.120]  going to ever, ever stop us. He was absolutely right. Nobody has stopped them from doing their
[42:01.120 --> 42:10.800]  drug trafficking worldwide. So you had CIA. And I saw DEA's participation in refueling planes
[42:10.800 --> 42:17.600]  of cocaine into the U.S. and never been arrested, never been seized or anything. They were just,
[42:17.600 --> 42:23.120]  you know, the Flacco Air Airport at the Elopango Airport. So they were heavily, definitely
[42:23.120 --> 42:27.280]  involving drug trafficking. And you had individuals tell you, hey, buddy, you're never going to stop us.
[42:27.280 --> 42:34.000]  That's right. I had a CIA official by the name of Randy Capster, who was down there for close to
[42:34.000 --> 42:40.880]  seven, eight years, involving those covert operations. And, you know, he was involving train
[42:40.880 --> 42:45.440]  of death squads and, you know, basically just about everything you could do covertly. And
[42:45.440 --> 42:52.080]  in Central America, he was involved in. And I have about an hour long video that's just full
[42:52.080 --> 42:57.600]  of clips of you on national television going over much of this in years past. And they're unable
[42:58.160 --> 43:03.600]  to even challenge you. You've got to be worried a little bit about your safety, sir. Well, you
[43:03.600 --> 43:10.880]  know, recently, to be honest with you, I've got some vehicles following me around, trying to,
[43:10.880 --> 43:16.880]  you know, I could tell their government, you know, because of my experiences and how they,
[43:17.520 --> 43:22.320]  when you approach them, they turn their face and they're on the cell phone. But I've been under
[43:22.320 --> 43:26.960]  surveillance for quite a while now. But you're not afraid. You were a highly decorated sniper in
[43:26.960 --> 43:34.080]  Vietnam. Exactly. Well, my point is this, you know, I've been in Vietnam, put it this way, I've been on bar time.
[43:34.080 --> 43:40.240]  So I make my peace with God and, you know, be it would be it, you know, but I will fight till
[43:40.240 --> 43:47.120]  the end and I will never, ever commit suicide. So I want to say that too. I will never commit
[43:47.120 --> 43:54.320]  suicide. Kevin, you want to. It's a triple non-suicide pack. I will never commit suicide.
[43:54.320 --> 43:59.600]  Yeah, you know, we're in a long haul. We need to fight these people, you know,
[44:00.720 --> 44:07.760]  till the very end and whatever we have available, what little we have, we'll,
[44:08.400 --> 44:13.360]  we need to continue fighting this because it's getting worse and it's going to get worse before
[44:13.360 --> 44:22.720]  it gets better if it gets better. Talking about Gary Webb, Sally, I mean, he's dead, shot gun to
[44:22.720 --> 44:28.000]  the face and they described his face from the sources and you got a call just two hours after
[44:28.000 --> 44:35.280]  they found him. You were notified and that his face was basically unrecognizable. Well, a shotgun
[44:35.280 --> 44:40.720]  doesn't do that if it's point blank. Shotgun only does that from a few feet away for the pattern
[44:41.360 --> 44:46.640]  to expand and people don't normally commit suicide with a shotgun to the face. Can you comment on
[44:46.640 --> 44:52.000]  what you learned about this? Well, I got a call from Michael Rupert who eventually he got his
[44:52.000 --> 44:56.960]  information right away after the incident and, you know, he knew that there was a note had been
[44:56.960 --> 45:02.880]  left and so forth and that he was planning to move that morning had the moves coming in
[45:03.440 --> 45:10.640]  and they found that note on the door. You know, allegedly that thing did not come in, you know,
[45:10.640 --> 45:16.080]  call 911 and call an ambulance. I mean, why on earth if you're going to commit suicide,
[45:16.080 --> 45:20.880]  do you like to, you know, bring an ambulance if you shoot yourself with a, with a 12-gate
[45:20.880 --> 45:25.520]  shotgun? Well, that sounds like the classic mafia activity blowing somebody's face off.
[45:25.520 --> 45:30.640]  Well, you know what? And to be honest with you, I really think when I speak about government
[45:30.640 --> 45:37.200]  people, I speak about Felix Rodriguez and his gun squads have been involved in all kinds of
[45:37.200 --> 45:43.760]  assassination attempts, whether it's war or domestic. You know, Felix and his group are very
[45:43.760 --> 45:50.240]  well documented as train assassins. Well, it's like Barry Seal. They just marched up machine gunning.
[45:50.240 --> 45:53.520]  Exactly. And, you know, and they're playing a couple of Colombians with head and so forth,
[45:53.520 --> 45:59.120]  but there's always people that are willing to take the fall for the agency.
[46:01.600 --> 46:07.200]  Unbelievable. Again, Selly, just for the record, tell us about your position in the DEA.
[46:07.200 --> 46:11.040]  Well, I was a senior agent in El Salvador. I mean, that's how serious the war and drugs
[46:11.040 --> 46:15.840]  were at that time. You know, we had, we had two agents covering the four countries in Central
[46:15.840 --> 46:20.880]  America. And, you know, I was assigned to cover El Salvador. Well, to be clear, I had read in
[46:20.880 --> 46:25.760]  mainstream media reports that you were described as the senior DEA officer in Latin America.
[46:25.760 --> 46:30.800]  Are those incorrect? No, no, those are correct. You know, I spent my time in New York City and
[46:30.800 --> 46:37.440]  domestically, but I was a senior agent and I was in charge of El Salvador. And, you know,
[46:37.440 --> 46:42.640]  we went out there and conducted this investigation. And so you'd signed on, you'd signed on to fight
[46:42.640 --> 46:47.920]  drugs. When did you find out that it was the government controlling it? Well, from the very
[46:47.920 --> 46:53.120]  good go, you know, I was, you know, when I got into Guatemala City and my country had to say
[46:53.120 --> 46:57.760]  Robert Stee has said to me, you know, there's some funny things going on in Salvador and just
[46:58.560 --> 47:04.560]  don't, don't step on anybody's toes and, you know, don't, don't report anything. And, you know,
[47:04.560 --> 47:09.760]  everything comes to me and so forth. And sure enough, my source of information was a guy who
[47:09.760 --> 47:14.800]  did all the flight plans for the, for the contra pilots that were heavily involving drug trafficking.
[47:14.800 --> 47:19.280]  And it was very well documented of money being seized in the U.S. and drugs being seized in the
[47:19.280 --> 47:25.440]  U.S. that came out of Villa Pango. There's no doubt about that. And we ourselves refuel some of those
[47:25.440 --> 47:31.040]  planes with the anticipation of being seized in, in the U.S. when they arrive. But, well, there
[47:31.040 --> 47:36.880]  have been cases where the local police bust planes on airports. This has been an Esquire magazine
[47:36.880 --> 47:44.800]  and the people flash CIA, national security badges. Terry Reed was there and saw the cocaine at
[47:44.800 --> 47:51.600]  Mina, Arkansas. I mean, they're countless, they're countless people who have actually witnessed and,
[47:51.600 --> 47:57.760]  and, and seen all of this. And it's, you know, it's, it's no secret. Yeah. Well, you know what,
[47:58.480 --> 48:03.440]  the thing about it, it indicates that Gary Webb was the fact that the contra story, the final report
[48:03.440 --> 48:10.000]  Higgs and CIO facial admits that they were sleeping with the enemy. And that there was a,
[48:10.000 --> 48:15.680]  an, an agreement between the CIA and the State Department of not reporting this incident.
[48:16.560 --> 48:23.040]  And, and what's always interesting to me is, is for you to explain how, like the whole supply
[48:23.040 --> 48:27.840]  chain of like how it got from Villa Pango all the way into the hands of Ricky Ross. And how did
[48:27.840 --> 48:32.320]  Ricky Ross do this for years without even knowing who was really behind it, just to
[48:32.320 --> 48:37.600]  get shared like the level of compartmentalization. Right. And see what happened was Ricky would not
[48:37.600 --> 48:44.080]  ask any questions. Why? Because everything was fronted to him. I'm concerned. So, you know,
[48:44.080 --> 48:49.120]  he, he, he cornered the market. He was like Walmart. He was able, everybody came to him from
[48:49.120 --> 48:54.880]  all over the country and he started the major distribution points and, and we saturated the,
[48:54.880 --> 49:02.080]  the country with cocaine. Well, I want to add this, the Colonel who was the head in Latin America
[49:02.080 --> 49:09.600]  back in 1998 for all counter drug operations was caught shipping in masses of cocaine and heroin
[49:09.600 --> 49:14.880]  into New York. And when I asked Barry McCaffrey about it, you know, he, he just literally turned
[49:14.880 --> 49:19.920]  red and couldn't talk and the whole audience started clapping and laughing at him. And I mean,
[49:19.920 --> 49:24.960]  that's another example. I mean, we've caught these people red handed, Selly. Well, you know,
[49:24.960 --> 49:30.240]  we have a CIO facial in Venezuela who shipped a thousand keys of cocaine without the approval of
[49:30.240 --> 49:36.320]  the DEA and then he was arrested and, and so forth. So there are incidents that are very well
[49:36.320 --> 49:41.360]  documented that our government was heavily involved in drug trafficking. And, and there's no doubt
[49:41.360 --> 49:47.680]  about that. I mean, the final report acknowledged the fact that it did happen and they turned a
[49:47.680 --> 49:52.560]  blind eye to it. Kevin Booth, anything else you want to add from the interview you taped last night?
[49:52.560 --> 49:59.920]  No, just, you know, I mean how you know that that I think Ricky was really sincere when
[50:00.880 --> 50:08.000]  when he felt like a real lost with Gary's death, regardless of how he died or whatever that it
[50:08.000 --> 50:12.560]  was a loss to him that he felt Gary was like a God sent in his life. And then that he probably
[50:12.560 --> 50:16.640]  wouldn't even be alive right now if it wasn't for Gary exposing this story. All right, Kevin,
[50:16.640 --> 50:19.760]  try to get back to your office and see if we can get that in the third hour. Thanks for joining
[50:19.760 --> 50:29.440]  us. We'll be back with a celly right after this break. Stay with us. Hey folks, Alex Jones here

[50:34.000 --> 50:38.960]  know our country is entering a high tech police state. Here's just a sample from my documentary
[50:38.960 --> 50:45.200]  film, Police State to the Takeover. In downtown Seattle today, the first amendment ended. The
[50:45.200 --> 50:50.480]  civil emergency was created by the police. Police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[50:50.480 --> 50:56.720]  The medical bills are are going to be enormous for me. You see them here with their hands
[50:57.280 --> 51:03.040]  cut behind their backs. They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig. The neighbors in that area
[51:03.040 --> 51:08.480]  of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old bridge was being reopened.
[51:08.480 --> 51:12.640]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[53:22.000 --> 53:41.280]  MSNBC, the Associated Press will tell you what is public. Skull and Bones was founded in 1832
[53:41.280 --> 53:47.200]  with money from the British East India Company. Mr. Russell, who was over all OPM
[53:47.200 --> 53:54.400]  sales in the United States. Ever since then, they've been in control of it. The people that
[53:54.400 --> 54:01.040]  founded the CIA in 1947 were publicly members of Skull and Bones. They've always been drug dealers.
[54:01.040 --> 54:06.560]  It's the heart of their business, whether it's Afghanistan now with record OPM sales and production
[54:06.560 --> 54:12.560]  or Latin America. This is how it works. They send in the military to go after any competition that
[54:12.560 --> 54:19.040]  is producing poppies or coca leaves that goes against them, and that's the war on drugs internationally
[54:19.040 --> 54:24.800]  so they can control the market, control competition. Then domestically, they bust the low-level
[54:24.800 --> 54:29.360]  dealers to put them in the prisons that the drug dealing families we've traced it back own
[54:29.360 --> 54:34.320]  predominantly. So they bring the drugs in, and then when they get your kids using them,
[54:34.320 --> 54:39.360]  then they put them in their private prisons working for 18, 20 cents an hour and displace
[54:39.360 --> 54:44.720]  those jobs and then make money by having the slave labor. Then they use the pretext of the drug
[54:44.720 --> 54:49.200]  war to militarize the police and to fund the militarization and have them bust down your door.
[54:49.840 --> 54:55.120]  That's why I will never use any of these drugs, not to mention the fact they're bad for you
[54:55.120 --> 55:01.600]  and very destructive. I won't use the same big pharma companies or also linked to OPM and cocaine.
[55:01.600 --> 55:06.960]  It's one big happy family. They also push their legal prescription drugs that are even more deadly
[55:06.960 --> 55:13.920]  than the illegal drugs on your children and on adults. So the drug dealers, the criminals run the
[55:13.920 --> 55:20.400]  country. That's what tyranny is. When criminals get control of government, we call that tyranny,
[55:20.400 --> 55:25.520]  and that's been the norm in history. America had been a little bit different, but now we've fallen
[55:25.520 --> 55:32.080]  down. Selly Castillo and the senior DA officer in Latin America to me with us into the next hour,
[55:32.080 --> 55:38.400]  we've got Chico Brown, one of Rhea Ricky's associates, one of the biggest former dealers,
[55:38.400 --> 55:46.640]  of course, on the West Coast as well. We'll be joining us, friends with Gary Webb. So that's
[55:46.640 --> 55:53.760]  coming up as well. Just ultra briefly, grab a pen and paper. Don't wait. Get my film, Police State,
[55:53.760 --> 55:58.480]  to the takeover. Two hours, five minutes long. 30 minutes of it is about the drug war.

[57:12.240 --> 57:18.320]  what are some of the things you want to get into? Well, basically, the announcement, the fact that
[57:18.320 --> 57:25.280]  to affirm the fact that the CIA was involved, how the whole operation was run out of LA and
[57:26.080 --> 57:33.040]  menaces and went down how they were actually getting their supply from the CIA. And also,
[57:33.040 --> 57:37.920]  during the break, I said, have they broken in your house? And your comment was, hell, yes.
[57:37.920 --> 57:42.480]  And you've done some things to be able to document that. Right. And you know,
[57:43.760 --> 57:48.000]  I, for example, will do the old-fashioned, the old-school type of stuff. I'll put like
[57:48.000 --> 57:53.840]  scratch tape on the beams of my door. And to find out if somebody actually came into my house
[57:53.840 --> 57:58.960]  and not when I was gone. And then they've been broken, which means they were inside the house.
[57:58.960 --> 58:03.360]  And you go and you look at your computer and you look at your stuff. And there's some pictures
[58:03.360 --> 58:11.360]  that I've had sort of way copies of them that were taken, pictures of CIA officials that I had
[58:12.800 --> 58:15.120]  copied. We'll be right back with the second hour.
[58:18.480 --> 58:23.360]  The war on terrorism. Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home? If you are
[58:23.360 --> 58:27.440]  like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[58:27.440 --> 58:31.680]  So what do you do? Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and
[58:31.680 --> 58:36.960]  biological or chemical attacks? With a little know-how, it's not that difficult. Sheltering in
[58:36.960 --> 58:42.320]  place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical and radioactive fallout, developed by
[58:42.320 --> 58:47.840]  Wayne LaBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable
[58:47.840 --> 58:52.960]  diseases and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S. government, gives you easy to follow
[58:52.960 --> 58:57.840]  video instructions and walks you step by step through the process of preparing your home as a

[59:14.640 --> 59:23.760]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[59:30.720 --> 59:38.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[59:38.000 --> 59:47.120]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[59:53.600 --> 1:00:02.080]  Celica Stillo, the senior DEA agent for Latin America, helped contribute to a lot of
[1:00:02.080 --> 1:00:08.240]  work. Gary Webb's Pulitzer Prize-winning work, exposing CIA drug-dragging, is here with us.
[1:00:08.240 --> 1:00:16.000]  Chico Brown, associate of the biggest drug dealer in West Coast history, who is in prison who we
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:21.600]  interviewed last night via telephone. We just gave you those revelations from the federal prison
[1:00:21.600 --> 1:00:29.360]  he's in in North Texas. Again, Chico Brown, the associate of freeway Ricky Ross. Gary Webb shot
[1:00:29.360 --> 1:00:36.160]  the shotgun, and he told freeway Ricky Ross on a phone conversation that he would come home and men,
[1:00:37.600 --> 1:00:42.160]  obviously very highly trained. Government types was his term, which shimmied down the drain pipe
[1:00:42.160 --> 1:00:47.360]  and runoff. And we were just talking to Selly. He gets followed. He said people going into his
[1:00:47.360 --> 1:00:53.280]  house, taking photos. He's got CIA officials he knows was involved in drug trade. Selly's come
[1:00:53.280 --> 1:00:57.280]  to town and gone over these documents publicly at public events and been on some of the local
[1:00:57.280 --> 1:01:03.520]  TV shows and been on this radio show. It's an honor to have him. Of course, he was a sniper in
[1:01:03.520 --> 1:01:10.320]  Vietnam, highly decorated. And he said, hey, he's on borrowed time. It's up to God. And same here.
[1:01:10.320 --> 1:01:15.040]  We can't be cowards. We have to be men. If the men aren't men, we become slaves. Our women become
[1:01:15.040 --> 1:01:20.640]  slaves. Our children become slaves. To be free, men got to stand up to evil, to bullies, to criminals.
[1:01:20.640 --> 1:01:24.960]  Organized crime is seized control of the country. We're going to go to break and go to Chico here
[1:01:24.960 --> 1:01:30.400]  in a few minutes. Can you talk about the mentality of your courage? I wouldn't call it macho, Selly.
[1:01:30.400 --> 1:01:36.880]  It's just you're an honorable veteran and veteran of the drug war, veteran of Vietnam. You saw this
[1:01:36.880 --> 1:01:41.760]  happening. Tell us why you do what you do and then describe for us the type of individuals,
[1:01:41.760 --> 1:01:48.320]  the sociopaths that are becoming wealthy off this. Well, off the drug trade. Exactly. Basically,
[1:01:48.320 --> 1:01:54.080]  you know, the way I was raised was, you know, you would thought what was right and what was wrong. And
[1:01:54.080 --> 1:02:00.960]  basically, I've always stood by that and was always doing the right thing, whether, you know,
[1:02:00.960 --> 1:02:05.120]  I felt about, you know, good about it or not, that, you know, I had to do the right thing. And when
[1:02:05.120 --> 1:02:10.800]  I got working with the government, I realized that at the end of the day, we ended up being the enemy
[1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:16.800]  and the bad guys and the assassins and the murders and everything else. And of course, that, you
[1:02:16.800 --> 1:02:21.040]  know, blew my mind away. You know, I couldn't understand what one arm of the government was
[1:02:21.040 --> 1:02:25.680]  fighting the so-called war drugs. Well, the other arm was sleeping with the cartels. And
[1:02:26.400 --> 1:02:31.600]  it was then and there that I realized that this is not the government that I thought I was going
[1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:39.360]  to be protecting and serving. I realized that I had to do something. So I started knowing the fact
[1:02:39.360 --> 1:02:47.440]  that I would, in my career with the DEA, which basically it did, because I'm forming the Washington
[1:02:47.440 --> 1:02:55.120]  and the ambassadors about the atrocities that were occurring in our countries. And even at the
[1:02:55.120 --> 1:03:01.040]  end when I left, you know, I, you know, my whole looked at life was the fact that I was looking
[1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:05.600]  for a job when I found that. And to me, it was, you know, you have to do the right thing and
[1:03:05.600 --> 1:03:12.480]  continue. And I did. I continued to talk about it after I left and documented one of the greatest
[1:03:12.480 --> 1:03:17.840]  things that saved me, I think it's been my documents, my journals. I've documented just about
[1:03:17.840 --> 1:03:21.920]  everything that happened in Central America. And I was an avid photographer. We signed it up,
[1:03:21.920 --> 1:03:26.160]  taking hundreds of pictures of the before, the after, the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[1:03:26.160 --> 1:03:30.400]  And you were there at the bases while the DEA was fueling the drug aircraft.
[1:03:30.400 --> 1:03:36.000]  Exactly. We, you know, running a covert operation about undercover operations, refueling those
[1:03:37.280 --> 1:03:44.000]  the place that we call the Islanders that were being refueled there, El Pango or in Guatemala.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:50.560]  And with the anticipation that they were going to be seized in Texas or in California,
[1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:55.360]  somewhere down the line once they crossed the border. And, you know, I started to question the
[1:03:55.360 --> 1:04:01.680]  fact that, you know, nothing would ever happen. So the DEA was part of those court operations and
[1:04:03.120 --> 1:04:07.920]  saturate in the whole country. And so for how long did you stay inside and covertly document?
[1:04:07.920 --> 1:04:13.920]  Well, basically for six years, I did that in Central America, even though I was warned that if I
[1:04:13.920 --> 1:04:19.840]  continued, so when once I was warned to stop my reporting, I knew that I was going to go full
[1:04:19.840 --> 1:04:27.600]  black with it. And we got a break. We got a break. We got a break. Alex Jones here announcing the
[1:04:27.600 --> 1:04:32.240]  release of my new film, police state three total enslavement. Police state three details the

[1:06:25.440 --> 1:06:30.240]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here and I've got a gripe. Recently construction in my area has
[1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:35.280]  doubled my commute time. I'm spending up to four hours in stop and go rush hour traffic every day.
[1:06:35.280 --> 1:06:39.440]  The worst part is there's no good talk radio to listen to but that doesn't matter to me anymore

[1:07:31.920 --> 1:07:39.920]  Gary Webb, a Pulitzer Prize winning writer for the San Jose Mercury News who also wrote the best
[1:07:39.920 --> 1:07:47.040]  selling book, Dark Alliance, was shotgunned in the face two days ago and we talked to Freeway
[1:07:47.040 --> 1:07:52.560]  Ricky Ross from prison last night. They didn't allow face-to-face interviews. He learned from us
[1:07:52.560 --> 1:07:59.680]  that he was one of the main sources for Gary Webb that Gary had died and said that Gary,
[1:07:59.680 --> 1:08:04.240]  the last time he talked to him, said he was being followed all over the place by government people
[1:08:04.240 --> 1:08:11.360]  that he'd come home to his house at least twice and government men with precision would shimmy
[1:08:11.360 --> 1:08:17.280]  down a small drain pipe down the back of his house from the two-story window and run off into the
[1:08:17.280 --> 1:08:25.760]  night. He was working on news stories and Gary focused in his first series on the drug dealing in
[1:08:25.760 --> 1:08:31.680]  South Central, the connection to the conference and the CIA and then of course, Celi Castillo was
[1:08:31.680 --> 1:08:37.440]  the head of the DEA operations in Latin America folks and for years he became aware of this,
[1:08:37.440 --> 1:08:41.600]  documented it, took the photos, the documents, was basically threatened over and he's come to
[1:08:41.600 --> 1:08:45.920]  Austin and done two-hour presentation showing the photos, the documents, who the drug dealers are.
[1:08:45.920 --> 1:08:54.560]  He was there in Latin America watching the DEA fuel the drug planes. It's unbelievable ladies
[1:08:54.560 --> 1:08:59.920]  and gentlemen and of course he was a friend of Gary Webb's and learned of it within two hours
[1:08:59.920 --> 1:09:06.000]  after they found his body, his face shotgunned away and again folks for those that don't use
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:09.920]  firearms a lot, haven't done a lot of hunting, haven't done a lot of target practice and shooting,
[1:09:09.920 --> 1:09:13.360]  you shoot somebody with a 12 gauge up close, it just blows a big hole in their head.
[1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:18.160]  You've got to shoot them from at least five feet away to blow their face off. I don't want to go
[1:09:18.160 --> 1:09:22.240]  into too many details of it but the pattern spreads out from there. That's what a shotgun
[1:09:22.240 --> 1:09:26.800]  does so that we have confirmed his face is basically blown off. We're not going to let
[1:09:26.800 --> 1:09:31.840]  him kill somebody, a hero like Gary Webb and that's obviously, this should be treated as a murder,
[1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:38.240]  as a homicide and then ignore that and I just want to say this before we go to Chico Brown
[1:09:38.240 --> 1:09:45.040]  and back to Selly. Yesterday the paramedics went public in England with Dr. David Kelly,
[1:09:45.040 --> 1:09:49.920]  the top UN weapons inspector from England who said that there were no weapons of mass destruction
[1:09:49.920 --> 1:09:54.560]  and then he told an American colleague and a British colleague that quote if I don't shut
[1:09:54.560 --> 1:09:59.440]  up they're going to kill me and put me in the woods. I've been told this and then a few weeks later
[1:09:59.440 --> 1:10:02.720]  he was found dead in the woods and the paramedics have gone public and said look
[1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:09.040]  his wrist were slit and there was no blood at the scene. We've been to suicide. If you bleed to death
[1:10:09.040 --> 1:10:16.080]  there's blood. Princess Diana said they killed my boyfriend and Charles has told me they're
[1:10:16.080 --> 1:10:20.240]  going to kill me in a fake auto accident. Then they clearly kill her in the fake auto accident,
[1:10:20.880 --> 1:10:24.800]  crash the car and then don't bring her to the hospital for an hour and 45 minutes total
[1:10:25.360 --> 1:10:31.200]  and then 75% of the British people believe they killed her but the media still says oh no no no no
[1:10:31.200 --> 1:10:36.160]  my point is bringing those up is that they do this over and over again. We saw Fami Malik,
[1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:39.840]  the Arkansas medical examiner with people with two shotgun blasts to the head,
[1:10:40.720 --> 1:10:45.680]  people with arms and legs cut off and trash dumps and they would rule this as suicides.
[1:10:45.680 --> 1:10:49.520]  We've seen cops killed in the Oklahoma City bombing case who were exposing government
[1:10:49.520 --> 1:10:55.360]  involvement, stabbed 13 times, throat slit, handcuffed marks, people tortured with electricity
[1:10:55.360 --> 1:11:00.480]  marks all over them, beaten from head to toe, beatings on the bottoms of their feet and these
[1:11:00.480 --> 1:11:06.960]  sicko coroners will say suicide. Well I'll never commit suicide, Sally is saying you'll never
[1:11:06.960 --> 1:11:12.320]  commit suicide. Now we're bringing up Chico Brown and he runs one of the biggest youth organizations
[1:11:12.320 --> 1:11:19.680]  in LA and of course he's changed his ways and done a great job. He was a co-defendant
[1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:26.720]  with Freeway Ricky Ross, the biggest drug dealer in West Coast history and Chico we appreciate
[1:11:26.720 --> 1:11:31.280]  your courage and your honor in coming forward and of course you were friends with Gary Webb
[1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:36.400]  and got a lot of information for us. Thanks for coming on. You're welcome. Thanks for having me.
[1:11:36.400 --> 1:11:38.880]  Thank you. Tell us a little bit about yourself and what you do in LA.
[1:11:38.880 --> 1:11:45.360]  Presently I run a place called home with a youth center with over 5,000 members for
[1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:50.480]  at-risk kids, kids from you know from different communities of comp and South Central LA.
[1:11:51.440 --> 1:11:55.360]  That program is you know help kids not because I don't want to see them go to prison.
[1:11:55.920 --> 1:12:02.640]  I also have another program called Life on Purpose. It's a computer literacy program that I put down
[1:12:02.640 --> 1:12:07.680]  all the 19 juvenile camps in Los Angeles County because I feel that after they educate the kids
[1:12:07.680 --> 1:12:12.560]  so they won't have to go through the same situation that me and Rick went through and that's you know
[1:12:12.560 --> 1:12:16.400]  going to prison and you know have to go with these prison ways and get along.
[1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:20.720]  And our film crew was just out in LA interviewing you for several days and man you've got a lot
[1:12:20.720 --> 1:12:25.520]  of great people involved in your program like Al Pacino the list just goes on and on out there
[1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:29.920]  helping you. Yeah my biggest one is Penny Morris is here. I mean she helped me on a day-to-day
[1:12:29.920 --> 1:12:37.040]  basis. I mean the Lakers, Brad Pitt, Mark Wahlberg, a lot of different people that helped me in my
[1:12:37.040 --> 1:12:42.720]  organization. Well would you like to tell folks you're not planning suicide anytime soon? Oh no
[1:12:42.720 --> 1:12:50.560]  that's never gonna happen. What did you think when you heard and pop it anytime Selly? I know
[1:12:50.560 --> 1:12:58.160]  you know Selly a great patriot, a great American as well. Tell us a little bit. I mean what did
[1:12:58.160 --> 1:13:04.800]  you think when you got the call? Well I always knew because it always came up one of these days
[1:13:04.800 --> 1:13:09.680]  we'll get that call saying that happened to him or somebody that was involved in this case so
[1:13:10.400 --> 1:13:14.320]  that wasn't it wasn't shocking to me that they would say that because I knew
[1:13:14.320 --> 1:13:18.480]  because he's riding in the car with him you know many times and we just talked about that stuff
[1:13:18.480 --> 1:13:22.720]  and he was like you know he used to tell me you know when it first to case first book I would say
[1:13:22.720 --> 1:13:26.240]  I mean you know I can't feel life and he would say something like you know what Chico you know
[1:13:26.240 --> 1:13:30.160]  I just got to do what I have to do but you know I've been getting death threats and stuff like
[1:13:30.160 --> 1:13:37.520]  that this is where we first the case first came open but again on record he told you he'd been
[1:13:37.520 --> 1:13:44.560]  getting death threats when he was first working on the case continuing now please yeah that's when
[1:13:44.560 --> 1:13:49.200]  the first the case first opened I actually you know when we was going to court you know and all
[1:13:49.200 --> 1:13:54.640]  this stuff started coming out and because I had got out on bail so he came to LA and we wrote around
[1:13:54.640 --> 1:13:59.840]  for a week you know he wanted to talk to me about the case and stuff and so in that conversation
[1:13:59.840 --> 1:14:04.960]  he was always saying you know I you know I get death threats all the time Chico and so to me
[1:14:04.960 --> 1:14:09.360]  when it happened when I got the news I actually read in the paper and my father called me and I
[1:14:09.360 --> 1:14:15.120]  was like man that time because he always told me like you know something like that would happen
[1:14:15.120 --> 1:14:20.240]  like you know you know they can get you anytime they want stuff like that and so I automatically
[1:14:20.240 --> 1:14:25.440]  said to myself what the hell my father said he got he killed himself I said yeah right my father
[1:14:25.440 --> 1:14:30.720]  said the same thing you know I just knew one of them that day was gonna happen on that one day
[1:14:30.720 --> 1:14:34.560]  we was gonna get that call I just talked to you during the break and Sally just learned of this we
[1:14:34.560 --> 1:14:38.880]  talked to freeway Ricky from prison last night we recorded it we're gonna be playing in the third
[1:14:38.880 --> 1:14:44.480]  hour or tomorrow we're having to upload it right now but he said the last time he talked to Gary
[1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:50.800]  Gary said this is recently he was being followed by cars he would come home and men I would call
[1:14:50.800 --> 1:14:55.520]  it special forces type but but he described him as government with great skill would literally just
[1:14:55.520 --> 1:15:00.640]  leap down and slide down the drain pipe and run off into the darkness cell he's had people breaking
[1:15:00.640 --> 1:15:07.120]  into his house what was that revelation like for you yeah I can yeah I know because I just think
[1:15:07.120 --> 1:15:12.160]  I talked to him too much I mean about six months ago and when they say it's suicide to me I know
[1:15:12.160 --> 1:15:16.960]  the guy I know he never do nothing like that and but for them to just open and say something like
[1:15:16.960 --> 1:15:22.000]  that I'm like man and then when I talked to Rick mother the day I called her first where her first
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:28.080]  was like she couldn't kill them you know you know and that was her first word I said you know Gary's
[1:15:28.080 --> 1:15:34.800]  day unbelievable let me bring selly and selly any comments to this well you know that's that's the
[1:15:34.800 --> 1:15:39.680]  way the government works that's the way that they've always worked because I actually spoke into some
[1:15:39.680 --> 1:15:45.120]  people that had been on operations with the government when they go out and associate people
[1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:51.280]  and that's exactly the same ammo that they've used for years and it's worked and they have a month
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:56.080]  carte blanche to do just about anything and get away with it you know we saw it with the Cuban
[1:15:56.720 --> 1:16:04.240]  we saw it with the with the different kinds of hit squads that they bring down to the U.S.
[1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:11.680]  to commit this atrocity now selly you're you're a unique expert on this subject I mean you were
[1:16:11.680 --> 1:16:16.400]  I don't want to call you an assassin but a highly decorated Vietnam sniper then the head of DEA
[1:16:16.400 --> 1:16:21.520]  operations in Latin America witnessing all this death squads and stuff going on in drug dealing
[1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:27.600]  and so when you say this is the M.O. I mean how can police then just automatically suicide case
[1:16:27.600 --> 1:16:35.920]  closed how do they control local Sacramento police to that level well because of you know coming down
[1:16:35.920 --> 1:16:42.080]  from from Washington you know it's every operation is approved by the CIA every single one of them
[1:16:42.080 --> 1:16:48.800]  is approved so they know better than to than to mess around with them because of you know they use
[1:16:48.800 --> 1:16:53.120]  all kinds of techniques you know one of the first tools that they use against individuals would be
[1:16:53.120 --> 1:16:58.480]  like the IRS you get out of it and you know you end up paying thousands of dollars that's the first
[1:16:58.480 --> 1:17:05.760]  tool to let you know that that you know they're after you and they give it why are why are people so
[1:17:05.760 --> 1:17:10.000]  cowardly I mean I don't even think I'm that have that much courage but I'm not gonna let a bunch
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:16.240]  of drug dealers ruin our country well you know they're they're they're doing it and and they're
[1:17:16.240 --> 1:17:20.880]  getting away with it that's that's the whole issue here but that's because more of us aren't
[1:17:20.880 --> 1:17:27.120]  standing up well but that's what it is and and that's the problem and we're we're having that
[1:17:27.120 --> 1:17:31.680]  major problem we saw it this election where people thought that it was going to change and didn't
[1:17:31.680 --> 1:17:40.800]  change and we have to take to the we're going to take it to the next day uh chico brown um what do
[1:17:40.800 --> 1:17:45.840]  you think about uh just it seems like the corruption gets worse and worse the good news is everybody
[1:17:45.840 --> 1:17:50.000]  I talk to now it's an open secret that the government controls the drug trade but still now
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:55.200]  everybody knows the truth but still the SWAT teams will raid some teenagers house for a bag of marijuana
[1:17:55.200 --> 1:18:01.520]  and ruin their life oh man that's so true because you know when that story first broke and everybody
[1:18:01.520 --> 1:18:07.200]  was excited uh for the LA time watched them post I remember Gary was there you know they
[1:18:07.200 --> 1:18:10.960]  want my story to you and they want my story but he didn't he wasn't willing to give his story to
[1:18:10.960 --> 1:18:17.040]  the bigger newspaper and then there was a conflict right there and you know his story was unique and
[1:18:17.040 --> 1:18:21.280]  it was true you know they had facts and they were like okay if you don't want to do this this is
[1:18:21.280 --> 1:18:25.280]  what we're going to do and then when they were three-page serious denied everything that he said
[1:18:25.280 --> 1:18:30.480]  the work title you know that's why I knew well man we've got we have problems yeah problems like
[1:18:30.480 --> 1:18:34.400]  that you know they can deny all these facts and make it look like it's due to a victim in the
[1:18:34.400 --> 1:18:40.240]  village Alex yes let me just add something to that uh you know I'm an expert witness now for
[1:18:40.240 --> 1:18:46.880]  entrapment and informants for the defense so I get hired or retained by different uh attorneys
[1:18:46.880 --> 1:18:52.800]  and and families from all over the country and every single every single case that I've worked on

[1:26:23.200 --> 1:26:31.200]  here well let me just say one thing that's so simple you gotta remember nobody's done a documentary
[1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:36.720]  on on a rank contra or the whole issue with the cia evolving drug trafficking and maybe that's
[1:26:36.720 --> 1:26:42.400]  what he was trying to put together uh something that was going to expose uh the bush administration
[1:26:42.400 --> 1:26:48.880]  going back uh there's a book called firewall by laurence walsh who who wrote about how they
[1:26:48.880 --> 1:26:55.120]  conspired and how they covered up the whole operation so you know that could possibly be it but i think
[1:26:55.120 --> 1:27:01.440]  that we need to have some kind of documentary out there and to really educate uh you know i'll be
[1:27:01.440 --> 1:27:07.840]  glad to donate my pictures and and my films to do that to that whole uh issue but it's gotta be done
[1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:14.960]  uh you know fernheit 9 11 everybody went crazy you know the most documentary uh thing done that
[1:27:14.960 --> 1:27:19.440]  was nothing and there was nothing and and that's exactly so now we have something that we can
[1:27:19.440 --> 1:27:27.360]  actually go out there and not don't let um here is that be be a denial to everybody else that needs
[1:27:27.360 --> 1:27:32.560]  to be educated or or uh uh into what's really going on with the government and what about
[1:27:32.560 --> 1:27:38.080]  also trying to force the local police to have it as a murder investigation well we can do that i guess
[1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:42.320]  the people who know he's been saying he was getting threatened and stuff just should call the police
[1:27:42.320 --> 1:27:48.080]  and call the media and go how dare you you know i i just wrote a a story on a soldier of forging
[1:27:48.080 --> 1:27:54.800]  magazine and uh felix came on and and you know he said now it's been with uh how they killed jay
[1:27:54.800 --> 1:28:01.200]  gorara and and and bolivia and and my point is they took him out because he was being threatened
[1:28:01.200 --> 1:28:06.400]  and and at the end of the day they found out that he's an icon now and and they go out and do stuff
[1:28:06.400 --> 1:28:12.080]  like that so we can't let gary's dad just go unnoticed and we have two forms yeah that's the
[1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:18.000]  point they turn they turn people into martyrs yeah and and we gotta do something to you know
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:23.040]  his death uh not in vain and so forth and and we gotta do something we just can't let it uh
[1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:27.440]  talk about it for a while and let me get a comment from chico on that no i agree that's
[1:28:27.440 --> 1:28:33.280]  we're gonna focus on this chico comments to keeping gary's memory and work alive we definitely
[1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:38.880]  gotta do something um you know like you said do a film about the situation i think if the mass
[1:28:38.880 --> 1:28:44.880]  public know it really goes well it went on and so these documents that gary has a lot of people
[1:28:44.880 --> 1:28:50.560]  have that i have that people never seen them not and just know what went on in our courtroom
[1:28:50.560 --> 1:28:55.520]  when he was willing to testify and they talk about you know the cia was there and everything
[1:28:55.520 --> 1:29:00.960]  that's coming up right now was not allowed to be in rick's trial when we went to court they were
[1:29:00.960 --> 1:29:06.720]  not going to talk about none of the cia involvement even though that we have proof and documents it

[1:32:58.240 --> 1:33:04.000]  journalism well of course we try to discourage it whenever we can but sometimes it happens anyway
[1:33:04.000 --> 1:33:08.240]  then we get especially nasty we have to naturally to protect our reputation
[1:33:10.080 --> 1:33:17.520]  yeah i love u.s. say today when they said jones raises allegations that schwarzenegger's father
[1:33:17.520 --> 1:33:25.360]  was a nazi i raised allegations that's like i mean that's your journalism yes the allegation
[1:33:25.360 --> 1:33:30.560]  that the sun came up today the allegation that arnold's from austria the the the allegation
[1:33:30.560 --> 1:33:38.160]  that hitler is from austria the allegation that ducks quack that water is wet i mean the media
[1:33:38.160 --> 1:33:42.000]  and i read the articles they did trying to attack where they were never on any information i mean
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:48.160]  i've interviewed the people on both ends of it they they catch cia bringing drugs in all the time
[1:33:48.160 --> 1:33:53.040]  here in texas they find tractor trailers full of three tons of coke and the police show up and
[1:33:53.040 --> 1:33:57.440]  say let it go they come and tell the border patrol let it go this is our shipment that's been in the
[1:33:57.440 --> 1:34:06.400]  associated press celly uh castillo of course senior da officer for what seven years in latin america
[1:34:06.400 --> 1:34:11.760]  uh tried to blow the whistle on all this but you're in texas do you remember back in the late 90s
[1:34:11.760 --> 1:34:18.000]  when they had that tractor trailer a cia coke and they made them just give it back and it was
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:22.160]  even in the newspaper just oh we just let it go you know we had it for a day but we were ordered
[1:34:22.160 --> 1:34:28.160]  to let it go it was the government's absolutely and it's still continuing just recently uh there's a
[1:34:28.960 --> 1:34:34.400]  a senior de agent that's been involved in drug trafficking for many years for the for the cartels
[1:34:34.400 --> 1:34:41.200]  in mexico and he sells a lot of the information um to the drug traffickers organizations and this
[1:34:41.200 --> 1:34:46.560]  guy's been around for close to almost 20 years now and nothing's ever happened to him because
[1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:52.000]  he's part of the apparatus that that built right outside the intelligence agency that they're
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:58.560]  continuing to to finance uh drug trafficking well all these intelligence agencies are like twin towers
[1:34:58.560 --> 1:35:04.320]  uh the corrupt rotten part is a small part but it's the top everybody else knows to go along
[1:35:04.320 --> 1:35:10.080]  and they build right next to it that you know the whole system that that runs parallel exactly
[1:35:10.080 --> 1:35:14.720]  absolutely and they continue to do that and we have the uh the involvement of the government in
[1:35:14.720 --> 1:35:21.200]  in the cover-ups and and uh just recently there were several uh customs agents arrested here in
[1:35:21.200 --> 1:35:26.880]  south texas for for their involvement in in in drug trafficking but again they get busted because
[1:35:26.880 --> 1:35:32.800]  they're low level guys cutting in they're covering up for the main guys uh you know uh uh you know
[1:35:32.800 --> 1:35:36.960]  i see it all the time you know where the u.s attorney's office will purchase themselves
[1:35:36.960 --> 1:35:44.400]  before a grand jury and and it's allowed and see and they do this uh uh alex because they know
[1:35:44.400 --> 1:35:53.520]  that at the end of the year uh the president will pardon a lot of these individuals that work for
[1:35:53.520 --> 1:36:00.080]  them uh george senior pardon a pakistan drug trafficker heroin trafficker right before he left
[1:36:00.080 --> 1:36:06.720]  office um bill clinton yeah uh everybody did the same thing and they're all going to be pardoned
[1:36:06.720 --> 1:36:12.080]  and then george george jr tells dan burton's committee don't go after clinton for pardoning
[1:36:12.080 --> 1:36:17.600]  giant coke dealers and then the media doesn't even pick up on it showing these guys are all just
[1:36:17.600 --> 1:36:21.680]  puppets and that's why they do all this and they get away with it because even if they get arrested
[1:36:21.680 --> 1:36:26.000]  uh at the end of the day they'll be pardoned well celly i'll tell you what i don't like and chicco
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:30.480]  i'll tell you what i don't like we're about to bring paul watson in i don't use drugs other than
[1:36:30.480 --> 1:36:35.840]  an occasional surveys uh uh with my mexican food or a glass of red wine with my italian food
[1:36:35.840 --> 1:36:41.360]  i drink one cup of coffee in the morning i mean that's the extent of my drug use but i many times
[1:36:41.360 --> 1:36:46.080]  had the police pull me over asked to search my car and i tell them no and they act like i'm evil
[1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:49.680]  and go what do you got to hide i go it's called the fourth amendment bro don't you want your kids
[1:36:49.680 --> 1:36:53.040]  to grow up in a free country and i'll start giving them a speech don't you know your bosses bring
[1:36:53.040 --> 1:36:59.200]  the drugs in you know they're they're just and by making drugs illegal it puts the profit in it
[1:36:59.200 --> 1:37:06.160]  and brings the gangs in and and criminalizes our society and drives the crime wave absolutely
[1:37:06.160 --> 1:37:10.560]  that's what i try to teach some of my kids at the high school on and criminal justice right
[1:37:10.560 --> 1:37:16.560]  i teach him that uh you know a racial profile is alive and well in texas uh all over the country
[1:37:16.560 --> 1:37:21.680]  and and uh you know you lost your fourth amendment right um and i'm profiling you know well it's true
[1:37:21.680 --> 1:37:26.320]  i've seen it they really on average and i'll see a black cop doing it to a black guy a mexican cop
[1:37:26.320 --> 1:37:31.280]  doing it to a mexican exactly i mean i i mean but it's like it's like we're allowed to be even
[1:37:31.280 --> 1:37:35.280]  meaner to the minorities but i'm a white guy man with blonde hair and blue eyes and they're pretty
[1:37:35.280 --> 1:37:44.720]  mean to me i mean what is this uh chico any comments to me i got stopped every time i turn
[1:37:44.720 --> 1:37:51.440]  the corner so you know so i just thought it was being they went on all around the country
[1:37:53.680 --> 1:37:57.600]  well a lot of people are going to get upset when they put in these new national ID card systems
[1:37:57.600 --> 1:38:01.520]  that passed last week they're going to have hardened checkpoints on the road where they
[1:38:01.520 --> 1:38:06.560]  search your cars like the airport is that a fact no we're we're they're doing that already
[1:38:06.560 --> 1:38:11.360]  they're doing it here in texas uh by the department of public safety they're uh profiling everybody
[1:38:11.360 --> 1:38:15.520]  one of the first questions they'll ask you is for example they'll stop the driver and get him
[1:38:15.520 --> 1:38:20.320]  off and then they'll go ask the passenger what was the last time you filled out your car
[1:38:20.320 --> 1:38:24.880]  and where are you coming from where you're going what are you taking and i thought my kids at once
[1:38:24.880 --> 1:38:29.280]  you get stopped and you say no to the search and they say well you know i'm i'm gonna do that or
[1:38:29.280 --> 1:38:33.840]  i'm gonna bring the dog for public car bring the dog yeah and then what my kids will do they'll
[1:38:33.840 --> 1:38:39.760]  dial 911 because it's recorded and you have an illegal search evaluation of your constitutional
[1:38:39.760 --> 1:38:44.400]  rights also it's recorded again when they say what do you have to hide you need to tell them look
[1:38:45.120 --> 1:38:49.680]  my fourth amendment would you like being pulled over and searched like this and people that i
[1:38:49.680 --> 1:38:55.920]  know go i'll let them search they don't have any drugs folks folks that's the point because you
[1:38:55.920 --> 1:39:00.800]  haven't done anything wrong make them get a dog make them but but listen here's the thing here's
[1:39:00.800 --> 1:39:07.360]  here's the deal people are going to jail in round rock texas for not returning i mean a week late
[1:39:07.360 --> 1:39:14.720]  a videotape to lockbuster hollywood video i have associated press articles where somebody moves
[1:39:14.720 --> 1:39:18.560]  and forgets to return a library book when they come back to town later and get arrested
[1:39:18.560 --> 1:39:24.400]  they're they're charging him folks i know korean war veterans i know an old man 75 years old
[1:39:25.520 --> 1:39:29.520]  no criminal record driving back from the south texas fishing at the at the coast
[1:39:30.080 --> 1:39:34.960]  and they said mind if i search your car and he said sure they arrested him for a full laying knife
[1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:41.760]  a full and they'll arrest old men folks with vet stickers okay they'll arrest old men with vet
[1:39:41.760 --> 1:39:47.360]  stickers uh for having a full laying knife uh in their car they'll arrest people who who i have
[1:39:47.360 --> 1:39:53.440]  friends uh one guy's like 45 years old owns his own company uh you know with the lawnmowers and
[1:39:53.440 --> 1:39:58.400]  trimming yards they arrested one of the members of his crew because there was a machete in the back
[1:39:58.400 --> 1:40:03.200]  folks you use them as a shetty when you're clearing brush and somebody's backyard it was in there with
[1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:09.520]  the lawnmowers and my point is it's like new york arresting somebody because the tip wasn't 20 percent
[1:40:09.520 --> 1:40:14.000]  that was uh new york daily news uh arresting people because they finish a candy bar before
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:18.480]  they get on the subway they said they chewed aggressively selly i mean are you seeing the
[1:40:18.480 --> 1:40:22.800]  system where everything's a crime it's funny here in texas you can you can drive around your
[1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:28.960]  truck with an ak-47 it's not illegal imagine that but get a knife or whatever they want to come out
[1:40:28.960 --> 1:40:34.160]  with it you know they can charge you with and it's all it's all up to them and that's why you never
[1:40:34.160 --> 1:40:38.480]  give permission for them to search no matter what never give permission because then if they do it
[1:40:38.480 --> 1:40:42.160]  without a warrant and they get the knife they then you're going to have a defense in court
[1:40:42.880 --> 1:40:48.560]  exactly and seeing once you target those police officers for doing they they have a uh a tail
[1:40:48.560 --> 1:40:53.120]  who we call a cola which means this guy's has been involved in a lot of a civil rights violations
[1:40:53.120 --> 1:40:57.440]  and i think people will start listening to him or or you get a civil rights attorney you just file
[1:40:57.440 --> 1:41:03.600]  on on them and and uh that's exactly what happened just recently a couple of days ago when uh when
[1:41:03.600 --> 1:41:09.040]  the police officers are resting operations on on 18 wheelers and uh they violated the guy
[1:41:09.040 --> 1:41:15.280]  they beat him up and then they let him go and so you know it is continuing to happen and and we
[1:41:15.280 --> 1:41:20.400]  need to put a stop to it here's another example i know old people again i mean the reason i bring
[1:41:20.400 --> 1:41:25.440]  up the old people is because it's an old lady and they got four thousand dollars cash in their purse
[1:41:25.440 --> 1:41:31.760]  no drugs cops go ahead and take it that's mainstream news oh yeah uh we we've got cases
[1:41:31.760 --> 1:41:36.320]  where the old man or old lady has there you know you take they sell it at all the grocery stores
[1:41:36.320 --> 1:41:40.400]  a little pill box where you take the pills you need and you put them for the day and there
[1:41:40.400 --> 1:41:45.440]  when you go on a day trip they're arresting people for having their pills out of their pill bottles
[1:41:46.960 --> 1:41:53.440]  yeah and again i know we've kind of diverged but this is what this whole drug war is about i mean
[1:41:53.440 --> 1:41:58.000]  look at i want to bring paul watson up from england paul they've got the drug war over there
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:02.480]  i know you've covered what happened here in texas uh two league of texas 50-something black
[1:42:02.480 --> 1:42:07.520]  people no criminal record no drugs found they just come arrest them and put them in the local
[1:42:07.520 --> 1:42:14.080]  prison owned by the local town fathers and you know what alex is still continuing that there's
[1:42:14.080 --> 1:42:19.280]  two other cases i'm working on test force cases um they're continuing to do the same thing they're
[1:42:19.280 --> 1:42:23.120]  they're taking the money they're instead of taking the guys to the police department they take it out to
[1:42:23.120 --> 1:42:27.520]  a little little ranch a little barn just slap them around and try to get them to confess where the
[1:42:27.520 --> 1:42:32.960]  money's at and and then they then they let them go i mean can you imagine that the task forces
[1:42:32.960 --> 1:42:37.840]  that's why they need to be disbanded and and it doesn't work it's never worked and and it's all
[1:42:37.840 --> 1:42:42.720]  it does is corrupt everybody you're talking about multi-jurisdictional task forces exactly paul watson
[1:42:42.720 --> 1:42:49.360]  comments along these lines yeah well you've you mentioned the drug situation in england um before
[1:42:49.360 --> 1:42:55.760]  the war in afghanistan tony blair publicly stated we will bomb the poppy fields and look at what's
[1:42:55.760 --> 1:43:01.520]  happened since the record level of afghanistan yeah and that you know that represents one third of
[1:43:01.520 --> 1:43:07.920]  the entire world drug trade that afghan gold and crescent and you know 200 billion dollars or more
[1:43:07.920 --> 1:43:14.560]  and so now the reports are you know record levels of heroin and opium on the streets of london and
[1:43:14.560 --> 1:43:20.000]  tony blair promised that he would bomb the poppy fields so they're bringing this system in which
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:25.040]  ties in with exactly the same kind of police state measures that are being introduced in this country
[1:43:25.040 --> 1:43:31.920]  as they are in america things like the id card and internal checkpoint so it's it's the same system
[1:43:31.920 --> 1:43:37.440]  being introduced at the same time we've been covering the obvious murder and i'll say it it
[1:43:37.440 --> 1:43:42.960]  should be a homicide investigation of gary webb some incredible revelations paul listening the last
[1:43:42.960 --> 1:43:49.040]  hour do you have any questions for chico brown or for celly castillo concerning these this murder
[1:43:49.920 --> 1:43:56.960]  well my thoughts i as you mentioned before are the the media complicity in the in the
[1:43:56.960 --> 1:44:02.400]  reporting of the death you know aside from the fact that so-called suicides related to the
[1:44:02.400 --> 1:44:08.240]  bush crime family beyond or you know akin to winning the lottery jackpot twice with two tickets
[1:44:08.880 --> 1:44:14.800]  and the media have been complicit in that they they calmly reported the cause of death and they've
[1:44:14.800 --> 1:44:21.360]  now since amended a lot of the articles to try and hide this to be shotgun wounds that wounds
[1:44:21.360 --> 1:44:26.320]  plural to the face now number one if you shoot yourself in the face you're not going to be
[1:44:26.320 --> 1:44:31.440]  you know any kind of state to pull the trigger again that's right the original article said
[1:44:31.440 --> 1:44:36.880]  wounds were you able to save that well there's still some of them that still say rooms that change
[1:44:36.880 --> 1:44:41.200]  most of the others that's what i'm asking we were able to save that before we catch them a lot going
[1:44:41.200 --> 1:44:47.120]  back in editing so exactly and again they don't retract it to say they were wrong they just take
[1:44:47.120 --> 1:44:54.000]  it out let me get a comment from celly on that celly absolutely right they they you know they're
[1:44:54.000 --> 1:44:59.360]  not smart enough to try to keep it glued together and they end up making a mistake and that's what
[1:44:59.360 --> 1:45:03.840]  it is when you lie about something you forget about what you said in the in the past and
[1:45:05.040 --> 1:45:10.800]  you know if it was the truth and they would have been it would be a solid solid case on it but
[1:45:10.800 --> 1:45:15.200]  you know they they do that a lot and they that's where we we pick up the bits and pieces to know
[1:45:15.200 --> 1:45:19.600]  that these people are lying to us chico brown now what do you think about that's a good point
[1:45:19.600 --> 1:45:24.720]  paul brought up first it's wounds and now they're going back and trying to change it yes i think
[1:45:24.720 --> 1:45:30.480]  ought to cover it it says appeared gunshot wounds to the face and that's the same thing i said yeah
[1:45:30.480 --> 1:45:36.880]  wounds wounds yeah well that's like two shotgun wounds the back of the head it's impossible to
[1:45:36.880 --> 1:45:43.920]  shoot yourself twice in the head of the shotgun there's also a very similar case that happened a
[1:45:43.920 --> 1:45:48.400]  few years ago at el toro where that colonel up there was trying to uh let's get ready to blow
[1:45:48.400 --> 1:45:52.320]  the whistle on the on the government's drug trafficking that's right it's a military base
[1:45:52.320 --> 1:45:59.120]  talks about the marine colonel that that was shot in the back and he also committed suicide
[1:45:59.120 --> 1:46:05.360]  according to the uh the military i mean how do cops come and stand over a dead colonel
[1:46:05.360 --> 1:46:10.160]  who stood up against drug dealing and seem shot in the back and go well we don't want this to
[1:46:10.160 --> 1:46:15.360]  happen to us because we're little cowards yeah let's just shut up exactly well none of us are
[1:46:15.360 --> 1:46:22.240]  safe when we have that attitude we've all got to stand up paul watson well yeah that's another
[1:46:22.240 --> 1:46:28.320]  one of the aspects to this and there's been this argument of you know why kill him now after all
[1:46:28.320 --> 1:46:33.520]  his great reporting has already come out obviously as you've been talking about he had new information
[1:46:33.520 --> 1:46:38.160]  that he was working on which was on the way and you know it would have been easier to get rid of
[1:46:38.160 --> 1:46:43.440]  him now but you know in a time when he was out of the spotlight rather than later on when he's back
[1:46:43.440 --> 1:46:49.200]  in the spotlight but also you know it's a fair assumption to make that this is also an extreme
[1:46:49.200 --> 1:46:54.960]  show of uh brewed intimidation to anyone else out there with the same kind of sensitive information
[1:46:54.960 --> 1:47:00.480]  whether that be related to the dia drugs issue or any other issue i think you're not all that
[1:47:00.480 --> 1:47:06.320]  will be consequences yes because uh now they're going to be taking steps to do uh things that
[1:47:07.360 --> 1:47:11.600]  have been done before covertly but now it's not going to be covertly they're just going to go out
[1:47:11.600 --> 1:47:16.240]  there outright and just do whatever the heck they want to do and if anybody wants to complain about
[1:47:16.240 --> 1:47:23.680]  it or whatever then that's the sign here we are we got the gary web kill that's what you want to
[1:47:23.680 --> 1:47:29.280]  happen to you or to your family you know you know try to try to stop us and that's what's going to
[1:47:29.280 --> 1:47:34.960]  happen they're going to come after anybody who goes against them you know i'm going to do something
[1:47:35.680 --> 1:47:39.600]  and i know that uh i'm going to let unless he wants to stay with us and he's welcome to
[1:47:39.600 --> 1:47:43.600]  chico go here in a few minutes we've taken so much of his time but i want to try to keep selly
[1:47:43.600 --> 1:47:47.680]  a little bit into the next hour if you can do it i know he's busy as well but regardless i
[1:47:47.680 --> 1:47:54.480]  want to keep the lines open here for only police officers or retired police officers
[1:47:54.480 --> 1:48:01.600]  or retired or current intelligence people who want to call in and and and try to refute this or add
[1:48:01.600 --> 1:48:14.320]  to it uh call in you know with your experiences or what you've witnessed 1-800-259-9231 1-800-2599-231
[1:48:14.320 --> 1:48:19.440]  but selly you know you raised this earlier all they do is turn people into icons they kill
[1:48:19.440 --> 1:48:26.720]  if we remember them and and and talk about them exactly and that's something that has to be done
[1:48:26.720 --> 1:48:32.240]  here with gary web i mean if they kill me or they kill you and we're on record uh you know
[1:48:32.240 --> 1:48:36.240]  saying we're not going to commit suicide i expect people to keep the memory alive
[1:48:36.240 --> 1:48:41.120]  and to use it against the new world order and and we gotta go different you know we need to go to
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:46.320]  the universities and lecture to them about what happened gary web because those are going to be
[1:48:46.320 --> 1:48:52.080]  the leaders of our country one day or people that we really need to go out you know grassroots
[1:48:52.080 --> 1:48:58.960]  individuals that they need to be educated in a uh you know i'm part of a group called people for
[1:48:58.960 --> 1:49:03.280]  peace and justice now and there are a whole bunch of young kids and when you talk to them about the
[1:49:03.280 --> 1:49:07.760]  cia and then the involvement and atrocities straight into that's what's on board that's what's
[1:49:07.760 --> 1:49:11.920]  going on in columbia right now see and they're not aware of those situations and we need to
[1:49:11.920 --> 1:49:18.000]  educate them uh bring them up to par on the whole issues of what what our government is doing uh
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:22.480]  chico chico anything else in closing you want to add i want to thank you for coming on with us

[1:49:39.040 --> 1:49:43.520]  in today's society for especially drug trade and how the government was involved
[1:49:43.520 --> 1:49:48.800]  you know like you said we don't record so whenever you know if something happened to me

[1:56:13.200 --> 1:56:19.120]  throw my desk uh yeah uh hello can you hear me yes sir okay yeah i i worked for a small agency
[1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:24.640]  in susan years ago and the reason i would never be able to serve on a jury is something that i
[1:56:24.640 --> 1:56:29.360]  had jury duty a couple times i tell them right off the bat that i've witnessed this before
[1:56:29.360 --> 1:56:33.520]  where i was responsible for typing up the blotter and i know good and well what happened out in the
[1:56:33.520 --> 1:56:38.480]  field because i was in radio contact and i followed the sequence of events that would happen in a
[1:56:38.480 --> 1:56:44.320]  certain arrest or this or that and uh then the officers got back to station and i'm sort of
[1:56:44.320 --> 1:56:49.040]  under there um as part of the job i'm under their authority so i
[1:56:52.400 --> 1:56:57.440]  boy that's just classic his cell phone cut out are you there yeah i was gonna say that yeah
[1:56:58.560 --> 1:57:04.080]  and and and call right back in but but yeah even tell them the dispatchers falsify reports
[1:57:04.080 --> 1:57:11.120]  sally yes sir you ever heard of dispatchers falsifying reports oh absolutely uh you know
[1:57:11.120 --> 1:57:17.920]  but one of the things that now it's computerized based on a 911 everything's recorded so then they
[1:57:17.920 --> 1:57:22.720]  always claim it malfunction yeah well see that's the other thing yeah or the camera wasn't working
[1:57:22.720 --> 1:57:27.680]  or so forth or the surveillance camera yeah but they do that all the time and and that's how they
[1:57:27.680 --> 1:57:33.200]  able to get away with it how do they get so many people to be corrupt just it's normal now well
[1:57:33.200 --> 1:57:38.400]  it's normal see it and everybody's cocky about it now they they're so blunt about doing what they're
[1:57:38.400 --> 1:57:44.480]  doing uh because they they feel that they're protected uh and also a lot of these tv shows
[1:57:44.480 --> 1:57:49.920]  these dramas the cops do bad things on those shows but they're still good so cops watch that and
[1:57:49.920 --> 1:57:54.560]  that's kind of like a moral comforter exactly it's it's letting you know it's okay for you to do it
[1:57:54.560 --> 1:58:01.040]  you know you know Paul Watson comments well yeah i mean they call these cctv cameras up to protect
[1:58:01.040 --> 1:58:04.720]  us but whenever they catch something which the government doesn't want you to find out about
[1:58:04.720 --> 1:58:11.440]  they mysteriously malfunction on every occasion now come on the government's good we should trust

[1:59:58.880 --> 2:00:04.080]  we'll be able to play the freeway ricky ross interview that kevin booth did with him of course
[2:00:04.080 --> 2:00:09.920]  we're talking about gary webb shotgun in the face uh the report first was multiple
[2:00:09.920 --> 2:00:13.760]  shot gunnings but but but now they're they're not retracting it they're just they're just
[2:00:13.760 --> 2:00:20.640]  removing it uh and again he was the big preeminent uh meet uh mainstream media reporter
[2:00:20.640 --> 2:00:29.200]  journalist who'd expose government complicity in the drug trade with the cia ricky ross was
[2:00:29.200 --> 2:00:40.000]  one of the main cia dealers uh there in the california and he learned from uh this office
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:48.480]  basically we're making a drug war film last night from kevin booth uh that uh that gary webb
[2:00:48.480 --> 2:00:54.000]  had died and he said oh man he told me there were people at his house people you know with
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:58.880]  people you know with special forces style would shimmy down the drain pipe and run off and we talked
[2:00:58.880 --> 2:01:03.600]  to chico brown uh gary webb had told him he'd been getting a lot of death threats this is just
[2:01:03.600 --> 2:01:11.040]  over the years uh he'd been being followed recently and uh he's dead committed suicide
[2:01:11.040 --> 2:01:17.120]  supposedly no investigation and you're a former law enforcement officer uh celly castillo the
[2:01:17.120 --> 2:01:21.920]  head of uh the dea for latin america i mean i would investigate this is a murder investigation
[2:01:21.920 --> 2:01:27.760]  isn't it a a no brainer exactly you know it's common sense will tell you you need to do what you
[2:01:27.760 --> 2:01:33.200]  got to do and and do it right but when you've got people pressuring you from from the chief of police
[2:01:33.200 --> 2:01:40.000]  or to anybody else to do the right to do uh what they're asking you to do and and uh i remember
[2:01:40.560 --> 2:01:46.080]  gang washington dc uh came all the way from washington to salvo to tell me to use the word
[2:01:46.080 --> 2:01:53.200]  alleged because uh there was no proof that the that the cia was involved in drug trafficking and
[2:01:53.200 --> 2:01:58.160]  i mean he came all the way down here to try to tell me how to do my job and and and uh you know
[2:01:58.160 --> 2:02:03.360]  that was uncalled for and that's when i started to document you know everything that i could uh
[2:02:03.360 --> 2:02:08.560]  especially his his uh you know i got him documented the timing date when he came up and told me to
[2:02:08.560 --> 2:02:14.800]  use the word alleged paul watson i mean there's no way to deny that you put men with covert powers
[2:02:14.800 --> 2:02:20.080]  in around hundreds of billions of dollars and it isn't going to become corrupt overnight but this
[2:02:20.080 --> 2:02:26.720]  system was corrupt to begin with paul well that's exactly the case the point you mentioned about
[2:02:26.720 --> 2:02:32.640]  you know why no investigation i mean here in this country it's legally imperative that there is a
[2:02:32.640 --> 2:02:39.200]  public inquest on anyone's death where the cause of death isn't totally clear you know clear cut with
[2:02:39.200 --> 2:02:45.600]  witnesses um so i don't that should play out in america obviously with these high profile cases
[2:02:45.600 --> 2:02:52.320]  they don't do that going back to the the gunshot wounds i've got two separate ap reports the first
[2:02:52.320 --> 2:02:57.520]  one which was posted you know in a local news channel affiliate website which you know they
[2:02:57.520 --> 2:03:04.240]  get them posted within minutes of their release says gunshot wounds the second ap article which
[2:03:04.240 --> 2:03:12.240]  was reposted in the seattle post intelligence say single gunshot wound and then the guy that put
[2:03:12.240 --> 2:03:17.120]  the obituary from one of the big newspapers i'm still trying to confirm which newspaper it was
[2:03:18.080 --> 2:03:25.280]  but he said that the coroner told him that web had multiple gunshot wounds so that's you can't
[2:03:25.280 --> 2:03:30.560]  argue that that's just a you know a difference in grammar between wound and wounds it's clear that he
[2:03:30.560 --> 2:03:37.040]  had multiple wounds is what the um journalists do put the obituary for one of the newspapers
[2:03:37.040 --> 2:03:43.600]  that'll be clear a shotgun unless it's shooting slug shoots out uh multiple pellets but but we're
[2:03:43.600 --> 2:03:48.560]  going to try to find out uh what's happening here but but clearly corners and police know what two
[2:03:48.560 --> 2:03:55.040]  different shotgun wounds look like uh just just just amazing but but bottom line because of his
[2:03:55.040 --> 2:03:58.800]  line of work and what he was into it should be investigated and then you look at him saying
[2:03:58.800 --> 2:04:04.640]  he was being threatened selly uh what is your gut tell you about what the cause of death was
[2:04:04.640 --> 2:04:10.400]  i mean suicide or murder for uh gary web you know i i think they actually came up to him and you
[2:04:10.400 --> 2:04:18.080]  know they told him you know today's payback day gary and uh this was gonna happen and and you're
[2:04:18.080 --> 2:04:24.400]  gonna be you're gonna be uh stay there let's hear it on the other side alex jones here announcing

[2:08:07.920 --> 2:08:13.600]  hour we're talking to selly distillo of course the senior dea agent for almost seven years
[2:08:13.600 --> 2:08:19.520]  in latin america publicly saw the government dealing the drugs bringing them in fueling the drug planes
[2:08:21.840 --> 2:08:27.200]  and selly before we went to that break you were to start over again i mean i mean clearly
[2:08:27.840 --> 2:08:32.880]  you've studied this you were a sniper yourself in vietnam but clearly you know how these these
[2:08:32.880 --> 2:08:37.520]  globalist criminals work when they went into his dark house i asked do you think they clearly killed
[2:08:37.520 --> 2:08:41.360]  him i mean the evidence is there he said he was being had been death-threaded had people
[2:08:41.360 --> 2:08:49.280]  you know shimmying down the pole down the water pipe coming down from upstairs several times when
[2:08:49.280 --> 2:08:56.000]  he come home recently being followed by cars and please continue start over and tell us
[2:08:57.280 --> 2:09:04.160]  how you think it went well i i think that i think that you know my my theory behind it i think
[2:09:04.160 --> 2:09:09.600]  that that happens all the time but i think that that gary was working on something huge
[2:09:09.600 --> 2:09:16.960]  and i think what he might have been working on it's just my guess now i think he was working
[2:09:16.960 --> 2:09:25.600]  on carlos lader's case uh carlos uh there was a lady called called barca well you told people
[2:09:25.600 --> 2:09:29.760]  that he was working on something new and big yeah and and i think that that's what it was
[2:09:29.760 --> 2:09:35.440]  called barca was a lady that started in his book that initiated the whole case in dark alliance
[2:09:35.440 --> 2:09:40.160]  well at the end of the day we found out that she was married to carlos lader and carlos lader
[2:09:40.160 --> 2:09:45.040]  was the biggest drug trafficker ever extradited to the u.s he was the co-founder of the mating
[2:09:45.040 --> 2:09:49.920]  cartel and he was supposed to be coming into the u.s to do life without the possibility of parole
[2:09:50.480 --> 2:09:56.000]  and uh he's been out of prison for several years after he testified against noriega and he's worked
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:10:03.360]  with the cia for since then so he's been up at about doing his business with the cia and i think
[2:10:03.360 --> 2:10:09.280]  that maybe garry you know maybe that was the story that he was working on i i don't know i'm not
[2:10:09.280 --> 2:10:14.720]  sure but but but before the break you described how they like to do it i mean uh you know describing
[2:10:14.720 --> 2:10:22.400]  how this may have gone down as he uh that night in his home yeah well you know we talk about
[2:10:22.400 --> 2:10:29.920]  you know the colonel and and out or the same thing uh with a shotgun uh same m o uh committed
[2:10:29.920 --> 2:10:35.680]  uh allegedly committed suicide and uh and uh they do that all the time they they find this
[2:10:35.680 --> 2:10:41.040]  freelancers uh they go out there and they're they're you know they go out and they kill people for
[2:10:41.680 --> 2:10:48.640]  for the agency or use people from the agency and they're all uh acts uh law enforcement uh or
[2:10:48.640 --> 2:10:54.080]  military guys that uh that actually believe that they can they can go out there and do do that and
[2:10:54.080 --> 2:10:59.120]  get away with it and and they do it most of the times but before the break you were you know
[2:10:59.120 --> 2:11:03.360]  describing how a lot of times this goes down that they probably talked to him beforehand can you
[2:11:03.360 --> 2:11:07.760]  describe that for us oh yeah well on that issue is you know they probably uh came up to him and
[2:11:07.760 --> 2:11:12.000]  they like to do that they like to tell you why they're gonna do you and and i remember seeing
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:17.120]  that in salvo doran and Guatemala they call you know what um today's payback day you know
[2:11:17.120 --> 2:11:22.240]  where all the shit that you've done and uh you're gonna go down and and it's up to you to go uh
[2:11:22.880 --> 2:11:29.040]  you go easy or you go hard so it's up to you and what do you got and you know it's like
[2:11:29.040 --> 2:11:34.240]  i remember uh cia guy telling the guy before he killed him in uh selly i understand you're doing
[2:11:34.240 --> 2:11:38.240]  this for documentary purposes just be just we have a lot of children listening but please be
[2:11:38.240 --> 2:11:42.240]  careful with any language okay i mean i understand this is a this is a murder we're talking about
[2:11:42.240 --> 2:11:46.560]  and it's pretty obvious but yeah that's what i've always read i mean i'm wasn't a law enforcement
[2:11:46.560 --> 2:11:50.960]  head of latin america for the dea like you were and i don't have all this experience i wasn't a
[2:11:50.960 --> 2:11:55.920]  sniper in vietnam but but just from the criminology i've read and what i've seen people i've talked to
[2:11:55.920 --> 2:12:00.880]  that this is uh what how they like to do it you walk in and they what hits you with a taser
[2:12:00.880 --> 2:12:05.200]  you wake up in the in the chair and they say we're about to kill you for what you've done
[2:12:05.200 --> 2:12:08.880]  yeah and and they tell you it's up to you how you want to die you want a guy slower you want to die
[2:12:08.880 --> 2:12:15.120]  fast and but you're you are gonna die because we need to know this we know that and uh you know
[2:12:15.120 --> 2:12:19.280]  can you just imagine sitting there uh figuring that it's the last few minutes of your life and
[2:12:19.920 --> 2:12:25.040]  and and then they they do you the way they do them with it with a shotgun and and it's devastating
[2:12:25.040 --> 2:12:28.480]  but that's that's the way they've worked that's the way they've done them most of the uh
[2:12:29.280 --> 2:12:32.960]  operations that i saw them do and well i know it's painful for you to talk about as you were
[2:12:32.960 --> 2:12:37.280]  friends right and and you know and and the thing about it i kept telling them no what you guys are
[2:12:37.280 --> 2:12:42.560]  doing is completely wrong i mean it's illegal and so forth and says you know uh we've been
[2:12:43.200 --> 2:12:47.040]  but you said we're gonna stop us and this is the way we do business and this is what you would
[2:12:47.040 --> 2:12:51.920]  talk to these people when you were down there oh absolutely and i would actually just walk out
[2:12:51.920 --> 2:12:58.320]  walk out of the room and because uh i remember one guy that said you know uh you know if you
[2:12:58.320 --> 2:13:03.200]  tell us we'll let you survive and after the guy finished spilling the beans he said well you
[2:13:03.200 --> 2:13:07.200]  know now you're gonna die so wait a minute you said i was gonna i was gonna live he says no
[2:13:07.200 --> 2:13:12.560]  you know we decided that you're a coward and that uh you know and the guy was waiting for his life
[2:13:12.560 --> 2:13:18.560]  because uh he had a family and so forth and this man and and they whacked him simple as that well i
[2:13:18.560 --> 2:13:24.400]  know this just a little advice to those out there i'm gonna fight people can be guaranteed to that
[2:13:24.400 --> 2:13:30.240]  man come in my house somebody's aiming a shotgun at me you're you know yeah you you know you try
[2:13:30.240 --> 2:13:35.360]  to take a couple with you and and uh everything fine if you do anything you don't and the thing
[2:13:35.360 --> 2:13:41.360]  about is that i think alex we're at the point that uh we've made our peace with whoever we have to
[2:13:41.360 --> 2:13:47.120]  make a peace with and and everything else is gravy you know if you talk they will come and and they
[2:13:47.120 --> 2:13:51.760]  will come but it's just a matter of time and when they're gonna be doing that but
[2:13:54.400 --> 2:14:00.240]  but as more people stand up as millions of people speak out they can't get everybody
[2:14:01.200 --> 2:14:05.920]  well exactly and that's what's gonna happen people are gonna finally realize that uh
[2:14:05.920 --> 2:14:10.560]  it's gonna be one of their kids and then they're gonna try to try to say well let's do this and
[2:14:10.560 --> 2:14:15.280]  let's do that and it always happens the way history will show that people will not get involved you
[2:14:15.280 --> 2:14:19.120]  know it happened with hitler remember hitler you know they all knew he was doing it and they let him
[2:14:19.120 --> 2:14:22.960]  do it and got away with it and then they've created this monster that they couldn't they couldn't
[2:14:22.960 --> 2:14:28.080]  destroy well let me try to bring paul watson and let me try to go over that psychology i've found
[2:14:28.080 --> 2:14:32.560]  they normally don't just kill you unless it's organized crime separate from the government
[2:14:32.560 --> 2:14:38.000]  for revenge it's normally because you've got a piece of evidence that is source material original
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:43.840]  source research that will burn them then they'll kill you they'll have a plane bomb your house and
[2:14:43.840 --> 2:14:50.320]  say your gas main went off i mean they'll they'll do whatever it takes uh and so so many people that
[2:14:50.320 --> 2:14:54.960]  have information creep around with it and then and do end up getting killed and it looks to me
[2:14:54.960 --> 2:14:58.640]  from the sources i've talked to that gary was working on something new and big and that's
[2:14:58.640 --> 2:15:01.840]  probably why they killed him do you think from your gut level they killed him for
[2:15:01.840 --> 2:15:05.200]  revenge his payback or or because he was working on something new
[2:15:05.200 --> 2:15:15.200]  selly yeah no i think it was both uh he was working on something new there's no doubt
[2:15:15.200 --> 2:15:20.640]  about that because he would be not about to give up and secondly that uh it's revenge because he
[2:15:20.640 --> 2:15:26.160]  was being a pain in the ass for them for so long with the cia and and they're involved in drug
[2:15:26.160 --> 2:15:32.720]  trafficking and and because drugs is still a big issue in in america um you know uh he would be the
[2:15:32.720 --> 2:15:39.440]  one to really start something um to restart the whole issue again and and we saw with afghanistan
[2:15:39.440 --> 2:15:45.120]  now with all more drugs coming in and um columbia let's not forget columbia man plan columbia is
[2:15:45.120 --> 2:15:50.240]  is devastating it's it's killing a lot of the latinos down there people are are really getting
[2:15:50.240 --> 2:15:56.080]  hurt on the drug issue and we have a paramilitary they're training those people downing and downing
[2:15:56.080 --> 2:16:01.680]  in iraq to go to salvador i mean to go to to columbia and and start those same operations the same
[2:16:01.680 --> 2:16:06.080]  blueprints they used in Guatemala that they used in vietnam are going to be used in columbia
[2:16:06.880 --> 2:16:11.200]  so that's that's what's going to happen and then it gives them a bigger army of sociopathic
[2:16:11.200 --> 2:16:15.680]  killers exactly exactly and they have their people that go out there and kill people and and that's
[2:16:15.680 --> 2:16:19.760]  exactly how they work you know they'll they'll talk to you real nice and then you know they'll
[2:16:19.760 --> 2:16:24.800]  convince you that uh you know you are going to die today and then how you're going to die is going
[2:16:24.800 --> 2:16:30.720]  to be up to you and and and that's that's exactly i think that what happened to gary they went in
[2:16:30.720 --> 2:16:37.920]  there and and they sent him down and this is look you know it's payback time and number two what do
[2:16:37.920 --> 2:16:45.680]  you got so you know it was both of uh it was a little bit of both in my opinion and so they put
[2:16:45.680 --> 2:16:52.240]  the screws to him yeah uh if he won't talk and they just kill him maybe will but and then again
[2:16:52.240 --> 2:16:58.240]  people can have knife wounds and shock wounds and be blackened head from toe and you can have photos
[2:16:58.240 --> 2:17:02.800]  of it and they'll say on the news yeah it was suicide the suicide and the worst scenario is if
[2:17:03.440 --> 2:17:12.160]  they get caught for example doing what they did they get arrested they get sent in knowing the
[2:17:12.160 --> 2:17:18.320]  fact that when the president leaves he's going to pardon them paul watson i appreciate you holding
[2:17:18.320 --> 2:17:23.920]  during this any um anything you want to both add to what uh celly's been saying oh yeah talk about
[2:17:23.920 --> 2:17:30.720]  the criminology and this is the same case i believe with the so-called suicide of david kelly it's
[2:17:30.720 --> 2:17:36.800]  almost a case that they want to be caught which is why they do such a shoddy job in covering up the
[2:17:36.800 --> 2:17:42.960]  murder because it works on two levels on one level they put out the story that it was suicide and you
[2:17:42.960 --> 2:17:48.400]  know bully the police and the paramedics into towing that line so that story goes out there
[2:17:48.400 --> 2:17:54.560]  placates the general public then underneath that there's all this evidence that it was a shoddy
[2:17:54.560 --> 2:17:59.360]  job which is you know what happened with the kelly murder yeah go over that i mean the police show
[2:17:59.360 --> 2:18:03.840]  up and guys in black uniforms run off there's no blood at the scene the paramedics say that the
[2:18:03.840 --> 2:18:08.000]  pills aren't digested in his stomach he told people they're gonna kill me and put me in the woods
[2:18:09.120 --> 2:18:14.080]  yeah and this again came out two days ago and just with this web situation there was a canned
[2:18:14.080 --> 2:18:19.440]  media response which was oh the poor family surely they just want to move on from all this
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:24.080]  and if the family knew five percent of the evidence which they obviously do
[2:18:24.080 --> 2:18:30.160]  against the suicide theory then they'd want a full public inquest and not the hudson whitewash
[2:18:30.160 --> 2:18:35.600]  which you know Blair said he knew the result of before it even started um michael shrinton the
[2:18:35.600 --> 2:18:39.600]  government barrister who was on your broadcast said the same thing that he was murdered that
[2:18:39.600 --> 2:18:46.240]  certain elements of mi5 were unhappy about it he has that from mi5 and as you mentioned the simple
[2:18:46.240 --> 2:18:53.120]  fact is it takes at least 12 to 24 hours if not days to die from slitting your wrist even if you
[2:18:53.120 --> 2:18:58.320]  cut through a major artery and obviously with the crime scene evidence there were only spots of
[2:18:58.320 --> 2:19:03.280]  blood at the scene where there should have been five pints or more and then as you said the men in
[2:19:03.280 --> 2:19:09.360]  black jumps suits and army fatigues around the body the special police units before the paramedics
[2:19:09.360 --> 2:19:14.800]  got there um as the paramedics said they find bodies out there on a monthly basis but in no
[2:19:14.800 --> 2:19:21.280]  other instance was there this massive police and army presence yes we'll be back stay with us
[2:19:24.720 --> 2:19:29.840]  those dark depressing days are here are you among the 15 percent of north americans who

[2:23:34.960 --> 2:23:40.320]  you're almost breaking down over this i know you were friends with uh gary webb and i appreciate
[2:23:40.320 --> 2:23:45.200]  i appreciate your courage in vietnam as a sniper highly decorated i appreciate your courage down
[2:23:45.200 --> 2:23:50.960]  there in the drug war for almost seven years as the head of the da in latin america i appreciate
[2:23:50.960 --> 2:23:54.880]  you having the courage to come on this broadcast and we've talked about how you come in your house
[2:23:54.880 --> 2:23:59.520]  and they've broken in there and you've gone through a lot and gary told folks he was being
[2:23:59.520 --> 2:24:04.400]  followed to harass and death-threaded and then to watch the media cover this up but we can get the
[2:24:04.400 --> 2:24:08.560]  truth out we can't educate the people and we can't explain to the young people don't use drugs
[2:24:08.560 --> 2:24:12.560]  they're not cool the government chips a man and that seems to be a good way to get kids to not
[2:24:12.560 --> 2:24:17.920]  ever use drugs to see it as a trap not as something that's cool uh how do folks get your book powder
[2:24:17.920 --> 2:24:22.800]  burns i know uh people can get it directly from you how do they do that well just email me at
[2:24:22.800 --> 2:24:28.240]  powder burns at prodigy dot net or you can actually call me and i'll get an address from you and the
[2:24:28.240 --> 2:24:39.040]  number is 956-345-5770 and that's uh that's uh again powder burns at prodigy dot net right
[2:24:39.040 --> 2:24:49.680]  and the number is 956-345-5770 well celly i think that gary webb at 49 survived by children and his
[2:24:49.680 --> 2:24:56.720]  wife i think that uh you know he's had a good full life and i think god uh was smiling down on him
[2:24:56.720 --> 2:25:02.240]  when these when these sickos obviously killed him and i think that he's been brought into heaven and
[2:25:02.240 --> 2:25:09.360]  is gonna uh you know be rewarded he certainly was a good person yes that's that's the very very
[2:25:09.360 --> 2:25:16.080]  sad thing about it he was a good person and all he wanted to do was was do the right thing and uh
[2:25:16.080 --> 2:25:21.760]  you know uh even though he stepped on people toes and and and he that's you know that's kind of
[2:25:21.760 --> 2:25:27.120]  individual that uh that he was uh doing the righteous thing well he had more people like him
[2:25:27.120 --> 2:25:32.800]  he wouldn't be so enslaved right now exactly and and once again education is is the key to this
[2:25:32.800 --> 2:25:38.800]  whole issue you know educate the public educate the kids and and once you do that then you'll
[2:25:38.800 --> 2:25:44.400]  you'll get you might get a momentum going and and hopefully things will change um and you know
[2:25:44.400 --> 2:25:48.640]  just my one last thing i want to say is that i'll be at you know often at the gun show this weekend
[2:25:48.640 --> 2:25:53.280]  in case somebody wants to come by and pick up a video or a or a book and that's at the Crockett
[2:25:53.280 --> 2:25:58.480]  Center that's correct all right i'll i may have been out of town but i may be back by then i may
[2:25:58.480 --> 2:26:02.880]  see you on sunday uh dropped by uh paul watson we got a few minutes left here and we're gonna keep
[2:26:02.880 --> 2:26:07.280]  paul into the final segment get into some other news well thank you for having me uh well thank you
[2:26:07.280 --> 2:26:12.560]  for staying with us here uh right at the end of this segment just a few more minutes selly uh paul
[2:26:12.560 --> 2:26:19.760]  watson uh you know these evil people that enjoy doing this uh i think it backfires on them from
[2:26:19.760 --> 2:26:25.680]  your studies of these type of assassinations uh does it work for them well it hasn't worked
[2:26:25.680 --> 2:26:30.480]  with david kelly but again maybe that goes back to the point that they almost want to be caught
[2:26:31.120 --> 2:26:36.640]  one thing which you could pursue with um garry web it'd probably be difficult at the moment but
[2:26:36.640 --> 2:26:43.600]  um with kelly they got the emails from him kelly was killed on the thursday night they found his
[2:26:43.600 --> 2:26:49.760]  body friday morning later on the emails came out which kelly had sent with him saying quote
[2:26:50.320 --> 2:26:55.360]  this should all blow over by early next week and he was talking about the investigations into the
[2:26:56.160 --> 2:27:03.600]  iraqi wmd this should all blow over by early next week when i go back to iraq and he he sent
[2:27:03.600 --> 2:27:08.720]  that email on the monday tuesday before he was killed the strongest evidence is him telling
[2:27:09.360 --> 2:27:15.040]  other weapons inspectors if i don't shut up will be found dead in the woods yeah exactly but that
[2:27:15.040 --> 2:27:20.160]  email proves that he was in no mindset to kill himself i mean he also said he was looking forward
[2:27:20.160 --> 2:27:27.360]  to his daughter's wedding um later on that month so i mean if anyone close to garry web can you know
[2:27:27.360 --> 2:27:33.200]  who communicate with him by email can get those emails and that's a major line of investigation
[2:27:34.880 --> 2:27:41.920]  celly yep that's right and that's that's what we need to do a lot of people will say well this
[2:27:41.920 --> 2:27:47.440]  will blow over and and so forth and that's why we have to continue to to fight for his cost and our
[2:27:47.440 --> 2:27:53.360]  cost and and and not let people get about what happened to him and then you know um you know
[2:27:53.360 --> 2:27:58.640]  there's the signs are there you know i will tell you today i will never commit suicide but it doesn't
[2:27:58.640 --> 2:28:04.960]  mean i'll get hit i'm with a in an accident and with an 18 wheeler and you know just blow me away
[2:28:04.960 --> 2:28:13.600]  or or things like that there's always accidents waiting to happen or a heart attack a heart attack
[2:28:13.600 --> 2:28:19.040]  exactly and and you know they'll say well you know he had a history of a of a high blood pressure
[2:28:19.040 --> 2:28:23.760]  and so forth and you know records will indicate that and but they will tell you that there's
[2:28:23.760 --> 2:28:30.560]  there's there's a medication that you can take covertly and and kill you uh you know uh give
[2:28:30.560 --> 2:28:37.360]  you a massive heart attack but it does happen and and once you make statements like that then
[2:28:37.360 --> 2:28:42.560]  they'll go to plan b you know the guys that do this though they go around killing good people
[2:28:42.560 --> 2:28:47.520]  that stand up the little folks they've got to have a hellish world i mean when i do something bad my
[2:28:47.520 --> 2:28:53.040]  life it always comes back on me selly you reap what you sow i wouldn't want to be between god
[2:28:53.040 --> 2:28:59.040]  and these evil globalists yeah well they they they uh becoming they they get in denial
[2:28:59.040 --> 2:29:03.600]  denial ability and and that they actually think that they're doing something for the government
[2:29:04.560 --> 2:29:09.680]  that they could be proud of yeah selly take care of my friend thank you sir for having me back with

[2:38:56.240 --> 2:39:01.200]  uh that you know real stuff poll watson i want to thank you for riding shotgun with us and
[2:39:01.200 --> 2:39:06.480]  and holding through all these guests and people i want to go to john and and and rick and jim and
[2:39:06.480 --> 2:39:13.280]  bill and then william and others but right now for folks that just joined us uh uh any other
[2:39:13.280 --> 2:39:18.080]  important news you want to talk about things that are happening globally yeah the global news is
[2:39:18.720 --> 2:39:24.880]  the geopolitical situation and that is that china and russia have just announced their first joint
[2:39:24.880 --> 2:39:31.520]  war games um and the two countries are basically following the exact same course as the u.s is being
[2:39:31.520 --> 2:39:36.800]  led down which is preemptive imperial action abroad and you know police take measures at home
[2:39:37.600 --> 2:39:43.040]  um and in the past we've seen that these kind of war games conducted by both china and russia
[2:39:43.040 --> 2:39:49.840]  have been designed around repelling an attack repelling against an attack by the u.s which is
[2:39:49.840 --> 2:39:55.200]  no surprise because certainly neocons don't hide the fact that no matter how large the country is
[2:39:55.200 --> 2:40:02.480]  anybody's a target um in their own recent policy documents and these speeches at the uh jerusalem
[2:40:02.480 --> 2:40:11.600]  summit they again listed france as a military enemy and in fact william crystal from the reports
[2:40:11.600 --> 2:40:17.920]  that he wrote that we posted on the website is now encouraging the u.s to invade south korea that's
[2:40:17.920 --> 2:40:24.000]  south korea not north korea under the justification that they're secretly working with the north
[2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:30.800]  koreans in allowing them to advance their nuke program so in the face of this it's no surprise
[2:40:30.800 --> 2:40:38.160]  that rusher and china are bonding and the man with the soul of love mr puti putis bush calls him
[2:40:38.880 --> 2:40:45.680]  vladimir putin by the way that's true he calls him puti put yeah at the ranch that he's pet name
[2:40:45.680 --> 2:40:54.240]  that's nicer than my nickname for you what he want but um putin came out publicly uh in the
[2:40:54.240 --> 2:41:00.240]  past few days and said that u.s was a dictatorship for instance tearing in the ukraine situation
[2:41:00.240 --> 2:41:07.200]  so now richard pearl we have a chilling of the love fest chilling at the love fest so pearl and
[2:41:07.200 --> 2:41:11.920]  people within the y-house to begin into question whether busher should be seen as an enemy again
[2:41:11.920 --> 2:41:17.440]  but the overriding factor is that you know the neocons can't really have any complaints because
[2:41:17.440 --> 2:41:24.400]  what's happening in the u.s internally is almost as bad as rusher and china uh putin just abolished
[2:41:24.400 --> 2:41:30.720]  the elections of regional governors by popular vote um you know how different is that from the
[2:41:30.720 --> 2:41:35.120]  the growth of federalization the growth of government in the u.s in regional governors will
[2:41:35.120 --> 2:41:44.000]  keep the systems in line fear oh boy and uh china just arrested another group of intellectuals for
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:51.520]  criticizing the government so how much different is that from the artist who was also almost arrested
[2:41:51.520 --> 2:41:56.880]  for creating the picture the bush face made out of monkeys you know that and they shot their
[2:41:56.880 --> 2:42:02.000]  the entire art exhibit down in new york yeah and i saw the picture it was no big deal bush's face
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:07.280]  made up a bunch of images of monkeys and then they shut the art exhibit down and we may arrest you
[2:42:07.280 --> 2:42:13.280]  you talked about the great leader oh my oh my oh my it's just like high school students who get
[2:42:13.280 --> 2:42:19.200]  arrested for um having t-shirts and bush on them saying not my president naturally bring the police
[2:42:19.200 --> 2:42:24.800]  in and arrest them but then again that's nothing compared to you know the the 10 year old girl
[2:42:24.800 --> 2:42:29.680]  who was arrested for bringing a pair of scissors into school she pulled her scissors out during the
[2:42:29.680 --> 2:42:33.600]  craft time when they had their little scissors almost cutting and they had to arrest her just
[2:42:33.600 --> 2:42:39.520]  a little dangerous so again they're both following the same part is internally and
[2:42:40.080 --> 2:42:45.120]  geopolitically but it seems that that you know following the same road but going in different
[2:42:45.120 --> 2:42:50.800]  directions so it seems that some organized chaos later on down the road is in the pipeline to create
[2:42:50.800 --> 2:42:56.560]  this global horror that the globalists need to pull this is a precursor to the new world order
[2:42:56.560 --> 2:43:02.400]  after the next big terror attack the draft comes in the real war starts the real wars which will
[2:43:02.400 --> 2:43:10.640]  require um it was for north korea the 600 000 troops so i mean all the people who speak out
[2:43:10.640 --> 2:43:14.480]  against this draft saying there's no need there's no way they need a draft they've got plenty of
[2:43:14.480 --> 2:43:18.480]  reserves plenty of troops to fight these wars well that's not the case when you get you know
[2:43:18.480 --> 2:43:22.880]  onto the borders of north korea and then china then they will need the full draft
[2:43:22.880 --> 2:43:28.000]  i tell you the globalists have really set up a mess
[2:43:30.400 --> 2:43:34.800]  meanwhile do you see this article in its mainstream news folks a satanic
[2:43:36.240 --> 2:43:41.200]  blood ritual and orgy manuals handed out to the middle school students
[2:43:42.960 --> 2:43:48.800]  yeah just completely by accident amongst a set of other material i forgot what it was
[2:43:48.800 --> 2:43:54.800]  related to now but something mundane just by accident amongst it are these satanic
[2:43:56.000 --> 2:44:01.280]  which blood ritual manuals which just you know casually got handed out amongst the students
[2:44:02.480 --> 2:44:09.280]  and i believe that came down directly from the police so just an accident again well it's all
[2:44:09.280 --> 2:44:17.120]  very christian i mean skull and bones is christian paul i tell you and then the real the real christianity
[2:44:17.120 --> 2:44:22.240]  i mean we've got that the article out that monday evening standard today third of people don't know
[2:44:22.240 --> 2:44:31.440]  jesus's birthplace that's what i am oh i'm smart so the real you know the real education on christianity
[2:44:31.440 --> 2:44:36.000]  even if you're not a christian you know the basic tenets of the bible and how to live your life which
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:41.120]  is you know successful and moral that's all being suppressed and even turn into hate crimes in
[2:44:41.120 --> 2:44:46.640]  canada and now the u.s where france just passed a law where you criticize or say you don't like
[2:44:46.640 --> 2:44:55.280]  homosexuality several years in prison and over 60 000 fine yeah that's the definition of thought
[2:44:55.280 --> 2:45:02.400]  crime uh homosexual movement preaches uh tolerance doesn't tolerate any criticism of it and that's
[2:45:02.400 --> 2:45:07.920]  not being run by even the homosexual leaders of those movements it's all coming down directly
[2:45:07.920 --> 2:45:13.280]  from government who then legislate this into law to make it the the pretext for shutting down any
[2:45:13.280 --> 2:45:19.760]  kind of free speech it's scary folks this whole thing is just is just unbelievable let's talk to
[2:45:19.760 --> 2:45:23.600]  and we're gonna go quickly to calls well thank you for holding for eons we'll give each color
[2:45:23.600 --> 2:45:30.000]  about a minute or two john and ohio go ahead yeah we may not know the identities of these slime balls
[2:45:30.000 --> 2:45:35.280]  see i connected slime balls were carried out this crime against truth and courage and humanity
[2:45:35.280 --> 2:45:40.160]  but i think they're the underground but i think we know the overground perpetrators
[2:45:40.160 --> 2:45:45.760]  uh it's the media it's the new york times it's the washington post it's the los angeles times
[2:45:45.760 --> 2:45:52.080]  who did an assassination attempt on him on on garry webb for his uh when more and more people
[2:45:52.080 --> 2:45:57.600]  became aware of the credibility assassination credibility of character assassination and
[2:45:57.600 --> 2:46:04.160]  they're doing it now post posthumously and i think we got to realize that we can go after them
[2:46:04.160 --> 2:46:10.640]  and uh i was uh recalling the fair dot org organization the media monitor which has become
[2:46:10.640 --> 2:46:15.360]  kind of watered down in recent years but originally their editor went to the new york times which is
[2:46:15.360 --> 2:46:21.600]  one of the biggest conduits for ci disinformation and he asked them why they weren't publishing this
[2:46:21.600 --> 2:46:26.160]  evidence of ci involvement in drug trafficking into that's available in the public record
[2:46:26.160 --> 2:46:31.040]  and uh they're a top investigator reported told them we're never going to allow that information
[2:46:31.040 --> 2:46:36.000]  to get to the public that would destroy the system but because it was not in in public
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:41.200]  uh in a public forum they could admit this kind of stuff and i think people have got to realize
[2:46:41.200 --> 2:46:46.720]  that the cia even according to carl brunstein he couldn't get written in his own uh washington post
[2:46:46.720 --> 2:46:52.400]  had to get written in an alternate magazine years ago that all of the top media the networks
[2:46:52.400 --> 2:46:56.800]  the new york times washington post time newsweek had not collaborated with the cia all throughout
[2:46:56.800 --> 2:47:01.920]  the cold war and planting false information to frame up countries for attack that npr
[2:47:01.920 --> 2:47:07.440]  pretends to be an alternative it's uh chairman pevin closes a former head of all ci foreign

[2:47:27.120 --> 2:47:34.720]  stopped either uh miami herald um with the headline um you know web's research based on
[2:47:34.720 --> 2:47:39.600]  discredited reports when the congressional investigations which proved it i mean you've
[2:47:39.600 --> 2:47:44.960]  just had a you've formed a head of dea you would witness to it so that the character
[2:47:44.960 --> 2:47:50.400]  assassinations continued the obituary in the la times was scathing as well which is why we're
[2:47:50.400 --> 2:47:55.760]  going to put up this page later on today um with all this evidence thrown in with these interviews
[2:47:55.760 --> 2:48:02.080]  today which will counter that now the real of the real obituary uh william uh i believe it's
[2:48:02.080 --> 2:48:09.760]  dr deagle what's going on um hi alex hello yes time today hello yes sir go ahead great you're
[2:48:09.760 --> 2:48:14.960]  still off because all of a sudden it sound like it disappeared um too i want to come from a different
[2:48:14.960 --> 2:48:20.000]  point of view i know delta special ops and navy and so on and everything you say and your experts
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:26.000]  say just now is absolutely the truth these drugs are coming in and i'm going to ask them if they're
[2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:30.800]  listening now and a lot of them are christians and they've seen these drugs come in on naval ships
[2:48:30.800 --> 2:48:35.840]  and c 130s when they're coming back from afghanistan and iraq i want them to speak up and call this
[2:48:35.840 --> 2:48:42.160]  radio program today or other days and as we stand up on the tens and the hundreds and thousands
[2:48:42.160 --> 2:48:46.480]  we're going to start coming against this drug war and then i wanted to mention two other things
[2:48:46.480 --> 2:48:51.840]  that haven't been mentioned so far the war on drugs is also a war on pain patients and pain
[2:48:51.840 --> 2:48:56.720]  doctors and where's all this money going it's going into weird projects that we don't need to discuss
[2:48:57.680 --> 2:49:04.160]  but the trillions of dollars in the last number of years and it's diverting the very basis of the
[2:49:04.160 --> 2:49:09.760]  uh constitution which is that the congress determines where money is spent and there's
[2:49:09.760 --> 2:49:13.760]  trillions of dollars that's coming in illegally to these weird projects that we
[2:49:13.760 --> 2:49:17.920]  can discuss on another date yeah the drug war is hundreds of millions a year that i mean that the
[2:49:17.920 --> 2:49:23.440]  globalists make off of it then they make money fighting it and set up the police state and then
[2:49:23.440 --> 2:49:27.440]  they're persecuting people are dying they can't get their pain medications and they're putting
[2:49:27.440 --> 2:49:32.480]  doctors like dr hurwitz now in virginia is going to jail looks like multiple life sentences are
[2:49:32.480 --> 2:49:38.000]  trying to treat pain patients this is the end of america and if people don't speak up now and that
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:43.680]  means you people on the front line that are in cia and dea you've got to start speaking up now
[2:49:43.680 --> 2:49:48.240]  because you're on the inside like i've been and you've got to speak up now or you're a miracle
