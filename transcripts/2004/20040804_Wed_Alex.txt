[00:00:05.575 --> 00:00:06.215]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.875 --> 00:00:07.956]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.656 --> 00:00:09.756]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.396 --> 00:00:11.236]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.976 --> 00:00:12.897]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.537 --> 00:00:17.458]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:21.879]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.321]  Well, my goodness, it's already Wednesday, the fourth day of August 2004.
[00:00:35.886 --> 00:00:42.673]  And it's been a month or two since I think I had this much vital news and information to cover with you.
[00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:46.536]  We're going to have wide open phones as well.
[00:00:46.556 --> 00:00:47.878]  The toll free number to join us.
[00:00:47.978 --> 00:00:54.384]  Any issue, any news item, any comment, any question you want to yell at me, you're welcome to join us.
[00:00:55.503 --> 00:00:55.843]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:56.043 --> 00:01:03.388]  The website, of course, is InfoWars.com.
[00:01:03.748 --> 00:01:09.212]  That's InfoWars.com, with a huge update for you today.
[00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:24.202]  This is out of the Boston newspaper, and it says, brain device offers hope for some mental disorders, out of the Boston Globe.
[00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:33.512]  And they say that, well, a new microchip in the brain will end depression and mental problems.
[00:01:33.972 --> 00:01:37.893]  And the government says 15% of us at least are mentally ill.
[00:01:37.913 --> 00:01:41.213]  They're starting the mental illness testing of all school children.
[00:01:41.273 --> 00:01:47.255]  Then it's going to be adults, now being announced as well in 10 states.
[00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:49.095]  Then they go to all 50.
[00:01:49.916 --> 00:01:54.437]  And they say, if they say that you're mentally ill, you're going to have to have the microchip in your brain.
[00:01:54.997 --> 00:01:55.957]  So, there you go!
[00:01:56.954 --> 00:01:59.775]  The brain device offers hope for some mental disorders.
[00:02:00.416 --> 00:02:10.721]  With its infamous history of crude ice pick lobotomies, they just stick an ice pick and wriggle it around the front of your brain, psychiatric surgery has been widely shunned for decades.
[00:02:11.601 --> 00:02:22.687]  Now it appears poised to make a careful comeback using a far gentler technology, a pacemaker for the brain that once implanted can be adjusted or turned off.
[00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.019]  Yeah, I just asked the Manchurian candidate.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:39.882]  Researchers at Butler Hospital in Providence are completing the largest study to date of the deep brain stimulation device potential to alleviate mental illness.
[00:02:41.862 --> 00:02:46.103]  Involving 10 patients with severe intractable obsessive-compulsive disorder.
[00:02:46.163 --> 00:02:53.304]  The doctors say it looks promising and they're beginning to test the device as a last resort for chronic depression.
[00:02:55.988 --> 00:02:58.951]  So this is in today's Boston Globe.
[00:02:58.971 --> 00:03:01.313]  Want to talk about that?
[00:03:01.353 --> 00:03:03.055]  You're welcome to.
[00:03:03.595 --> 00:03:04.636]  This is out of Newsday.
[00:03:04.736 --> 00:03:07.399]  Source terror attack to begin early September.
[00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:08.920]  They're going to attack us.
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.624]  Alciada will attack us in early September.
[00:03:12.664 --> 00:03:16.247]  And I didn't see this, but I got three or four emails that I had time to read.
[00:03:16.267 --> 00:03:18.730]  I was on Don Griffin's show for 45 minutes in
[00:03:20.985 --> 00:03:21.245]  St.
[00:03:21.325 --> 00:03:25.446]  Louis this morning, he said he saw it on Hannity and Combs.
[00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:27.026]  Did you see it?
[00:03:27.046 --> 00:03:30.907]  Can somebody who taped it call in and play it?
[00:03:31.047 --> 00:03:31.887]  I bet you did!
[00:03:32.428 --> 00:03:45.190]  General Tommy Franks, who in the Cigar Aficionado in December, back in December said that well it's sad but after another attack we're going to have to have martial law and that's just the way it is.
[00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.011]  He supposedly said the exact same thing again
[00:03:49.108 --> 00:03:56.914]  Last night on television, and I'm hearing he did it on MSNBC and FOX, so he was on multiple channels.
[00:03:57.474 --> 00:03:58.495]  Did you see this?
[00:03:59.196 --> 00:04:02.278]  Can you call in and confirm it for us?
[00:04:02.318 --> 00:04:08.122]  Again, a talk show host who I know and respect says he saw it, so I'm sure it happened, but I did a quick search and couldn't find it.
[00:04:08.583 --> 00:04:13.386]  Somebody do a more detailed search and email it to tips and info wars dot com.
[00:04:16.008 --> 00:04:18.190]  And we'll get it posted.
[00:04:20.177 --> 00:04:29.463]  By the way, we caught our good buddies at NORTHCOM General Eberhardt with PSYCOPS PSYOPS people manipulating the US public.
[00:04:29.503 --> 00:04:30.804]  This came out in the news.
[00:04:31.824 --> 00:04:32.465]  What's new?
[00:04:32.485 --> 00:04:34.066]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[00:04:36.607 --> 00:04:41.850]  And Ridge defends new terror threat warning despite the fact he admits that it's over three years old.
[00:04:43.932 --> 00:04:46.233]  So a lot of key information coming up.
[00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:47.534]  That's only the tip
[00:04:48.351 --> 00:04:49.892]  Of the iceberg, my friends.
[00:04:49.912 --> 00:04:51.072]  We'll cover it all when we get back.
[00:04:51.452 --> 00:04:53.413]  Don't forget, also, another website we have.
[00:04:54.213 --> 00:04:55.834]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:55.874 --> 00:05:00.576]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.156 --> 00:05:03.977]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[00:05:04.098 --> 00:05:04.918]  Michael Trudeau here.
[00:05:05.058 --> 00:05:08.359]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:14.222]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[00:05:14.342 --> 00:05:17.363]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[00:05:17.623 --> 00:05:21.907]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[00:05:22.088 --> 00:05:24.009]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:31.177]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[00:05:31.377 --> 00:05:33.879]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.484]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice, only this time it changed my life.
[00:05:38.764 --> 00:05:41.247]  After six weeks I noticed some improvement, and after 12 weeks,
[00:05:41.747 --> 00:05:42.708]  Measurable improvement.
[00:05:42.868 --> 00:05:45.311]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:48.094]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[00:05:48.254 --> 00:05:48.795]  Side effects?
[00:05:48.955 --> 00:05:51.238]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now too.
[00:05:51.398 --> 00:05:52.879]  Call Kliscott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:53.100]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.581]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:55.182]  It worked for me.
[00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:01.809]  Terrorism!
[00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:02.709]  Terrorism!
[00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:08.873]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:06:09.134 --> 00:06:10.715]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:06:10.955 --> 00:06:13.456]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:13.817 --> 00:06:28.406]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:28.446 --> 00:06:28.767]  government.
[00:06:28.927 --> 00:06:30.628]  Anyone can follow the simple instruction.
[00:06:31.088 --> 00:06:37.009]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:41.670]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.
[00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:47.371]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:47.391 --> 00:06:48.611]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:48.671 --> 00:06:49.251]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.271 --> 00:06:51.312]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:07:00.194 --> 00:07:04.557]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:07:04.698 --> 00:07:09.161]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:09.281 --> 00:07:13.685]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:15.066]  The New World Order.
[00:07:15.886 --> 00:07:16.627]  Hammered!
[00:07:16.847 --> 00:07:21.070]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:28.074]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:28.194 --> 00:07:30.196]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:30.896 --> 00:07:31.316]  We're good.
[00:08:05.692 --> 00:08:06.332]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.993 --> 00:08:08.053]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:09.854]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.514 --> 00:08:11.355]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.095 --> 00:08:12.996]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.676 --> 00:08:17.338]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.838 --> 00:08:21.980]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:26.282 --> 00:08:27.563]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:08:27.623 --> 00:08:29.184]  We're now into the second segment.
[00:08:29.304 --> 00:08:31.625]  Eight minutes and thirty seconds into the first hour.
[00:08:33.872 --> 00:08:36.634]  It is Wednesday, the fourth day of August.
[00:08:38.256 --> 00:08:41.999]  And again, I'm going to put the call out periodically throughout the broadcast.
[00:08:42.079 --> 00:08:50.906]  Did you see Tommy Franks, the outgoing head of CENTCOM, repeat his comments from last December's Cigar Aficionado?
[00:08:51.861 --> 00:09:02.224]  on national television that it's real sad and he hates it but if there's another attack we go to martial law and a military form of government and set aside the Constitution.
[00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:02.804]  Why?
[00:09:02.884 --> 00:09:08.086]  It's what the people want and he's real sad about it but you know we've got to face up to this.
[00:09:08.146 --> 00:09:10.667]  This is what happens if there's another attack.
[00:09:10.707 --> 00:09:14.908]  They're now framing that in our minds just like they did before 9-11.
[00:09:17.925 --> 00:09:40.316]  And we've caught General Eberhardt putting ads in the newspaper in Colorado for people with high-level security clearances to come to NORTHCOM, our new martial law directorate, kind of like the KGB master base, coming out and saying, we need people to be part of our strategic deception operation internationally and domestically.
[00:09:40.736 --> 00:09:42.917]  I even have the newspaper ad here in front of me!
[00:09:44.031 --> 00:09:50.472]  And of course, the Pentagon Office of Strategic Information says they're going to lie to us, and they have been lying to us quite a bit!
[00:09:52.953 --> 00:09:53.473]  Incredible!
[00:09:53.513 --> 00:09:59.474]  They say, we're going to lie to you and plant fake news stories and manipulate you, and then when you point it out, they go, we never said that.
[00:09:59.574 --> 00:10:01.035]  Oh no, you just put a press release out.
[00:10:02.675 --> 00:10:06.636]  That way, see, if they ever really get caught red-handed, they say, well, we told you we were going to lie to you.
[00:10:06.876 --> 00:10:09.437]  It's just incredible what they're doing.
[00:10:09.477 --> 00:10:11.197]  They tell you they're going to lie to you.
[00:10:13.143 --> 00:10:15.066]  They tell you they're going to manipulate you.
[00:10:15.948 --> 00:10:17.951]  And people are still in denial.
[00:10:20.155 --> 00:10:23.761]  And we've got articles here about brain implants so you won't be depressed anymore.
[00:10:23.781 --> 00:10:25.063]  The government wants you to take them.
[00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:32.252]  They're saying huge terror attacks in early September and Ridge defends new terror threat warnings.
[00:10:32.292 --> 00:10:33.432]  This out of the Associated Press.
[00:10:33.712 --> 00:10:45.756]  Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge on Tuesday defended the decision to tighten security in New York and Washington even though the intelligence behind the latest terror warnings was as much as four years old, he said.
[00:10:45.776 --> 00:10:50.998]  Law enforcement officials were trying to determine whether the plot was current
[00:10:51.644 --> 00:11:01.711]  With terrorists still trying to organize such an attack in an investigation made more urgent by revelations linking the suspect behind the intelligence with the 98 bombings of the U.S.
[00:11:01.771 --> 00:11:03.172]  embassies in East Africa.
[00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:12.978]  Funny, at that very time, Al Qaeda was under CIA contract publicly, this is admitted, attacking the Serbs as a pretext to invade them.
[00:11:13.598 --> 00:11:17.661]  Oh look, they're fighting back, we've got to invade the Serbs and take over for the U.N.
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:27.844]  In those devastating truck bombings in Africa, Al-Qaeda operatives have begun casing targets in Kenya almost five years in advance.
[00:11:27.944 --> 00:11:40.690]  The warnings that terrorists might be plotting attacks on specific buildings in New York, Washington, Newark, New Jersey have prompted authorities to elevate the terror alert level for the financial sector in those cities to orange or high.
[00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:45.772]  Streets have been closed with barricades erected and heavily armed police guarding potential targets.
[00:11:49.877 --> 00:11:57.142]  And you're all being framed, black ski masks, sandbags, barbed wire, fences, machine guns equals freedom and safety.
[00:12:00.164 --> 00:12:06.989]  And again, we've got General Tommy Franks out spouting off on Hannity and Combs, and I'm told on other broadcasts, I didn't see it.
[00:12:07.469 --> 00:12:12.353]  I've confirmed this though with Don Griffin down in, or I should say up in St.
[00:12:12.413 --> 00:12:17.136]  Louis, I was on his show, and he said, yeah, he saw with his own two eyes, and I got emails on the subject.
[00:12:17.936 --> 00:12:20.436]  Did you see this?
[00:12:20.456 --> 00:12:21.437]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:12:21.477 --> 00:12:28.238]  Again, preparing us in a preparatory phase to do all of this.
[00:12:28.658 --> 00:12:30.578]  Open discussions of suspending elections.
[00:12:30.678 --> 00:12:32.338]  Open discussions of marginal law.
[00:12:32.719 --> 00:12:34.259]  Open discussions of Red Alert.
[00:12:34.919 --> 00:12:35.979]  The Washington Post.
[00:12:36.379 --> 00:12:37.559]  Gannett News Service.
[00:12:37.619 --> 00:12:38.820]  Associated Press.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:39.560]  Reuters.
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:43.140]  Saying there's federal plans to lock down whole sectors.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.501]  Again, I said a Red Alert will be done in sectors first.
[00:12:45.861 --> 00:12:46.941]  In a block of states.
[00:12:48.522 --> 00:13:02.948]  As a test mode for future nationwide red alerts, and they're not going to let you have your children, they'll give them back to you after a few hours, maybe a few days, get you trained that, oh, it's safe, we can get on the buses, we can get on the trains and go to the emergency centers to get our children.
[00:13:03.308 --> 00:13:16.733]  So when they really do it, in the next terror attack, after the next terror attack, a few terror attacks down the line, when they really drop the hammer, we'll accept it and go willingly for our showers.
[00:13:19.642 --> 00:13:21.423]  I'm not joking around, by the way.
[00:13:22.284 --> 00:13:23.625]  You go, why would government do that?
[00:13:23.665 --> 00:13:25.486]  Well, why does government always do that?
[00:13:25.747 --> 00:13:27.008]  Why is that the norm?
[00:13:27.388 --> 00:13:29.850]  Freedom and liberty being the exception!
[00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:32.892]  And you sit there, sucking your thumb in a naive fashion.
[00:13:34.113 --> 00:13:37.135]  I have to tell you, though, I don't mean all the listeners, I mean those that are in denial.
[00:13:37.776 --> 00:13:46.442]  I have to tell you, though, that I was on, you know, mainstream news talk station, you know, 30-year-old station in St.
[00:13:46.502 --> 00:13:47.223]  Louis today,
[00:13:48.695 --> 00:13:57.954]  They have this commentary by the program director at the start of each hour after the news, and I've heard it many times being a guest on that show, probably 15 times.
[00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:11.793]  And in the past, the program director kind of sounded like a neocon, but today, his one-minute analysis was, we don't want martial law, we don't want to suspend the elections, and we don't want the takeover of our society.
[00:14:12.113 --> 00:14:13.373]  Everyone should be against this!
[00:14:13.653 --> 00:14:16.514]  If we do this, we kill American freedoms and the terrorists win!
[00:14:17.054 --> 00:14:17.734]  What's happening?
[00:14:17.794 --> 00:14:18.614]  People, wake up!
[00:14:19.134 --> 00:14:20.835]  See, it's not funny anymore.
[00:14:21.355 --> 00:14:25.375]  And I'm on other talk stations as a guest, every day, and I hear this same concern.
[00:14:25.636 --> 00:14:27.676]  People that laughed at me, that made jokes,
[00:14:28.504 --> 00:14:31.745]  But see, they heard me five, six years ago talk about all this, and now it's all happening!
[00:14:32.005 --> 00:14:33.765]  So see, it's not funny anymore!
[00:14:35.106 --> 00:14:39.107]  But a lot of you are probably going to decide to just join the New World Order.
[00:14:39.167 --> 00:14:48.870]  You're deep down afraid, so you'll make the split-second subconscious decision to, well, we gotta do it, and, you know, it's not that bad, and I'm just gonna go along with it, because I'm a big fat coward.
[00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:48.950]  1-800-259-9231
[00:14:56.014 --> 00:15:00.617]  And we will also, we've got a guest coming up in the next hour.
[00:15:01.778 --> 00:15:03.679]  We have chilling photos from 2004.
[00:15:03.759 --> 00:15:06.581]  Not just 2003, 2004 of a citizen's squads
[00:15:15.023 --> 00:15:40.693]  that have been created where they take former military people put them in uniforms that say MP and they go out on the roads and the streets and at the football games and the high school and college football games and they search people and they're going to have the neighborhood watch do this, they're going to have all the truck drivers, the cable men, the exterminators
[00:15:42.114 --> 00:15:42.555]  Everyone!
[00:15:42.995 --> 00:15:46.898]  It's being announced all over the country with federal grants at the state level.
[00:15:46.938 --> 00:15:50.461]  You know it is the TIPS program and they changed the name so people aren't aware of it.
[00:15:51.662 --> 00:15:52.703]  So that's coming up.
[00:15:52.743 --> 00:16:08.457]  We have these incredible photographs and the gentleman is going to be coming on the broadcast from Pensacola, Florida who was in Alabama for this college football game and took these photographs of this.
[00:16:10.282 --> 00:16:19.825]  So this is something that you do not want to miss, and it integrates in with just the incredible photos we have out of Boston of the police.
[00:16:20.326 --> 00:16:22.546]  By the way, do you know what started Sunday?
[00:16:22.586 --> 00:16:23.727]  We knew there'd be some violence.
[00:16:24.647 --> 00:16:29.289]  There had to be an excuse for the police to attack the crowd, and they did have provocateurs in there.
[00:16:30.169 --> 00:16:33.690]  But it all started over a paper mache bottle.
[00:16:34.831 --> 00:16:37.732]  The police thought it was a Moloff cocktail, so they had to attack the crowd.
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:44.808]  And then send you that message that, well, that they're God and that we're basically their slaves.
[00:16:45.749 --> 00:16:48.152]  So that is coming up as well.
[00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:57.804]  Let me cover this now and then we'll go to break and go back to your calls starting in the next segment.
[00:16:59.764 --> 00:17:04.426]  This is out of page 15.com and it's on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:17:04.566 --> 00:17:07.808]  Evidence of Pentagon psychological warfare operations against U.S.
[00:17:07.868 --> 00:17:10.589]  citizens surfaces in want ads.
[00:17:11.629 --> 00:17:12.050]  The U.S.
[00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:22.354]  Military's Domestic Operations Command says it is not planning or conducting a secret psychological warfare campaign to manipulate the opinions of American citizens.
[00:17:23.395 --> 00:17:25.275]  Despite a U.S.
[00:17:25.376 --> 00:17:28.517]  Air Force document suggesting such activities might be taking place.
[00:17:29.758 --> 00:17:35.599]  The Pentagon said two years ago they were launching the Office of Strategic Information, which would, quote, plant fake news stories and lie to us.
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:36.860]  I'm continuing.
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:48.743]  We do not do information operations against the American people, said Lieutenant Commander Sean Kelly, a spokesman for the Pentagon's Northern Command, known as NORTHCOM, based in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[00:17:49.923 --> 00:17:53.944]  Of course, one of the NORAD chieftains, General Eberhard, who
[00:17:54.884 --> 00:18:02.825]  Who, uh, helped with things on 9-11, did such a good job, has been rewarded with the Chieftain position over this.
[00:18:04.176 --> 00:18:07.017]  Hey, Russia has one of these domestic military forces, why shouldn't we?
[00:18:07.637 --> 00:18:22.441]  Kelly, and they're consulting with the KGB by the way, Primakov and others, Kelly confirmed there is a PSYCOPS, or Psychological Warfare Operations Unit at NORTHCOM, but said its work is designed to influence and deter foreign enemies from attacking the United States.
[00:18:22.982 --> 00:18:27.723]  Funny, P2OG, set up by the Pentagon, says that they try to get people to carry out attacks.
[00:18:28.593 --> 00:18:30.614]  I guess you're a bunch of liars, so it doesn't matter.
[00:18:31.074 --> 00:18:39.179]  NORTHCOM was created after 9-11 attacks to direct military operations, including intelligence analysis, air defense, and support for civilian first responders.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:46.223]  Inside the United States, it shares the military's counterterrorism mission with the Pentagon's Pacific Command, Central Command, and Strategic Command.
[00:18:46.824 --> 00:18:54.308]  The possibility of a propaganda program run out of the military's domestic headquarters surfaced with a phrase in an online employment ad
[00:18:55.623 --> 00:19:02.812]  An advertisement for an Influence Operations Specialist with a top security clearance for the U.S.
[00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:06.677]  Air Force appeared on the website of military contractors several weeks ago.
[00:19:07.478 --> 00:19:14.467]  The position would coordinate, and here it is, Air Force inputs to NORAD NORTHCOM Influence Operations.
[00:19:15.145 --> 00:19:26.593]  According to the ad, it defined these operations to include PSYOPs, themes, and messages for use for foreign countries, public affairs themes, and messages.
[00:19:26.633 --> 00:19:28.514]  So, domestic public affairs, folks.
[00:19:28.894 --> 00:19:30.956]  As well as deception plans.
[00:19:31.256 --> 00:19:31.356]  Oh!
[00:19:32.056 --> 00:19:33.197]  Deception plans?
[00:19:33.697 --> 00:19:38.280]  The same position and job description is included in an Air Force contracting documents.
[00:19:39.381 --> 00:19:42.603]  At first, NORTHCOM refused to discuss the existence of any such operations.
[00:19:44.264 --> 00:19:45.025]  And they continue.
[00:19:46.832 --> 00:19:49.375]  We'll come back, take calls, get into more of this later.
[00:19:49.396 --> 00:19:50.557]  I mean, come on, folks.
[00:19:51.118 --> 00:19:56.205]  They've been caught planning hundreds of fake letters from troops in newspapers of how much they love the war.
[00:19:56.725 --> 00:19:56.905]  Ha!
[00:19:57.306 --> 00:19:57.446]  Ha!
[00:19:57.827 --> 00:19:57.947]  Ha!
[00:19:58.147 --> 00:19:59.909]  They're running most our police departments!
[00:20:02.609 --> 00:20:07.111]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:20:07.451 --> 00:20:11.533]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:20:11.833 --> 00:20:12.374]  We listened.
[00:20:12.694 --> 00:20:17.696]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:20:17.956 --> 00:20:18.436]  We listened.
[00:20:18.817 --> 00:20:21.858]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:20:22.298 --> 00:20:22.818]  We listened.
[00:20:23.299 --> 00:20:26.340]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:26.961]  We're good to go.
[00:20:52.541 --> 00:20:54.184]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[00:20:54.204 --> 00:20:55.747]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:00.982 --> 00:21:05.686]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[00:21:05.926 --> 00:21:09.348]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[00:21:09.569 --> 00:21:12.051]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[00:21:12.291 --> 00:21:20.877]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[00:21:21.258 --> 00:21:27.022]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[00:21:27.282 --> 00:21:29.264]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[00:21:29.484 --> 00:21:36.429]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.
[00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:43.235]  Midas Resources is pleased to offer a subscription to the International Forecaster newsletter free of charge with a qualifying order.
[00:21:43.495 --> 00:21:50.821]  That's right, for a limited time, Midas Resources is offering a one-year subscription to Bob Chapman's powerful newsletter, the International Forecaster.
[00:21:51.061 --> 00:21:55.529]  Call 800-686-2237 for more information or to place your order.
[00:21:55.609 --> 00:21:55.869]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:55.889 --> 00:21:57.492]  Call today and avoid getting soaked tomorrow.
[00:22:01.543 --> 00:22:04.044]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:04.724 --> 00:22:11.385]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[00:22:12.545 --> 00:22:14.846]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[00:22:15.646 --> 00:22:21.887]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[00:22:22.767 --> 00:22:30.849]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia, and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[00:22:31.889 --> 00:22:39.753]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:40.614 --> 00:22:42.154]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:42.174 --> 00:22:42.535]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:42.555 --> 00:22:42.815]  Call now.
[00:22:42.855 --> 00:22:45.256]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:23:00.703 --> 00:23:02.205]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:23:02.386 --> 00:23:03.527]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:23:03.707 --> 00:23:07.112]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:23:07.232 --> 00:23:07.653]  Phenol!
[00:23:07.973 --> 00:23:15.062]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:23:15.503 --> 00:23:19.485]  ETA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:23:19.585 --> 00:23:20.025]  Fragrance?
[00:23:20.405 --> 00:23:25.167]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:23:25.307 --> 00:23:29.989]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[00:23:30.229 --> 00:23:32.710]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:36.432]  Well, like all of the products from the Kalben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:23:36.592 --> 00:23:40.173]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:23:40.333 --> 00:23:42.694]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:23:42.874 --> 00:23:43.735]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:23:43.855 --> 00:23:53.599]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Kalben Pure Soaps.

[00:24:02.362 --> 00:24:07.523]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:08.183 --> 00:24:10.544]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:10.564 --> 00:24:18.485]  Folks, the Pentagon has got military in plain clothes all over the country.
[00:24:18.565 --> 00:24:20.426]  It's now even come out in the mainstream news.
[00:24:20.966 --> 00:24:24.767]  They're merging police departments with CIA offices in major cities.
[00:24:25.787 --> 00:24:26.227]  They had
[00:24:28.391 --> 00:24:36.557]  Enlisted Marine Corps full-time officers kicking down gun dealers doors in the late 1980s on the East Coast.
[00:24:36.617 --> 00:24:37.378]  I've interviewed them.
[00:24:38.318 --> 00:24:41.961]  They have lined up this giant apparatus of oppression and control.
[00:24:42.001 --> 00:24:43.482]  They plant fake news stories.
[00:24:43.842 --> 00:24:45.103]  They lie perpetually.
[00:24:45.684 --> 00:24:47.585]  People say, well, then you don't support the military.
[00:24:47.605 --> 00:24:48.586]  You're absolutely right.
[00:24:48.726 --> 00:24:51.128]  I don't support having a domestic KGB.
[00:24:52.849 --> 00:24:55.591]  You know, it's like living in Germany and saying, well, you don't support the
[00:24:56.405 --> 00:24:58.766]  The German military.
[00:24:59.287 --> 00:25:01.188]  And people said, you better support the Fuhrer.
[00:25:01.668 --> 00:25:05.850]  Well, no, I don't support the Fuhrer turning the military into an instrument of oppression.
[00:25:06.951 --> 00:25:08.732]  And that's where all this is going, my friends.
[00:25:08.772 --> 00:25:11.253]  We're all being conditioned for really horrible things.
[00:25:11.613 --> 00:25:13.354]  To repossess and take your wealth.
[00:25:14.195 --> 00:25:15.735]  So you go ahead and join the system.
[00:25:15.755 --> 00:25:17.857]  You go ahead and go along with them and you see what happens.
[00:25:18.417 --> 00:25:19.497]  Johnny in Texas.
[00:25:19.577 --> 00:25:20.338]  Johnny, go ahead.
[00:25:21.209 --> 00:25:21.870]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.872]  Thank you very much for everything you're doing for all of us.
[00:25:25.113 --> 00:25:26.194]  You've enlightened the world.
[00:25:26.294 --> 00:25:28.256]  We appreciate it and keep up the good work.
[00:25:28.276 --> 00:25:34.141]  This is a little bit off your subject, but I want to talk just a few seconds about the land grabs that are going on.
[00:25:34.161 --> 00:25:40.086]  I have a good friend here in Austin that owns 50 acres off of Spicewood Springs Road.
[00:25:40.427 --> 00:25:41.608]  Very beautiful land.
[00:25:41.928 --> 00:25:43.109]  Has a creek running through it.
[00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:46.993]  The city will not negotiate with him
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.581]  to turn this into a theme park.
[00:25:49.621 --> 00:25:51.222]  This is the latest thing they've shot down.
[00:25:52.503 --> 00:25:56.785]  They want the land and they've offered him 15 cents an acre for it.
[00:25:57.485 --> 00:25:58.306]  Here it is again.
[00:25:58.346 --> 00:25:59.586]  We've got the same problem.
[00:25:59.926 --> 00:26:01.907]  This happened to a man out in Florida.
[00:26:02.388 --> 00:26:08.551]  He's holding up the restoration of the Everglades because he doesn't want to sell his land for 15 cents an acre.
[00:26:08.791 --> 00:26:10.632]  Well, they're also going to flood
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.603]  Uh, part of Miami for the Everglades.
[00:26:14.683 --> 00:26:17.526]  I mean, we're talking 55, 60-year-old neighborhoods.
[00:26:18.107 --> 00:26:20.810]  And they're just saying, hey, we don't care, we're not paying you for it.
[00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:25.455]  The Supreme Court ruled no just compensation two years ago, three years ago now.
[00:26:25.855 --> 00:26:27.056]  Time is flying past us.
[00:26:27.817 --> 00:26:31.441]  And here in Austin, they took, the city stole tens of thousands of acres.
[00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.450]  I think?
[00:26:48.821 --> 00:26:50.302]  Sell it to developers.
[00:26:50.322 --> 00:26:51.302]  So don't worry.
[00:26:51.342 --> 00:27:04.228]  Your friend, once he's forced to sell for 15 cents an acre, and I have read about this, once he's forced to do that, then they're going to sell it for hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions an acre, and probably build a hotel on it.
[00:27:04.688 --> 00:27:11.091]  It's like the land they stole east of Austin that they're now going to build a giant hotel, resort, and five-star golf course.
[00:27:11.511 --> 00:27:12.952]  This is exactly what they're doing.
[00:27:13.012 --> 00:27:17.336]  They did the same thing up on 620 and 2222 here at the intersection here out.
[00:27:17.436 --> 00:27:21.959]  Well, sir, if you won't give up your land and if he won't for 15 cents an acre, that aids Al-Qaeda, okay?
[00:27:22.339 --> 00:27:24.581]  Not going along with the government aids terrorists.
[00:27:24.681 --> 00:27:26.482]  The government's got a plan to keep us safe.
[00:27:26.923 --> 00:27:29.144]  You gotta do everything they say, when they say.
[00:27:29.265 --> 00:27:31.506]  Government cannot do anything wrong.
[00:27:31.766 --> 00:27:33.047]  The state is God.
[00:27:33.308 --> 00:27:35.189]  It's never done anything wrong in history.
[00:27:35.409 --> 00:27:40.073]  And you, sir, are insane because you are questioning the authorities.
[00:27:40.494 --> 00:27:43.707]  Not only am I questioning the authorities, I will fight them!
[00:27:44.364 --> 00:27:47.525]  Using any and all legal means at my disposal.
[00:27:47.725 --> 00:27:49.986]  They have backed us into a corner.
[00:27:50.046 --> 00:27:53.127]  Well, if you give them laws, the feds are trying to remove U.S.
[00:27:53.167 --> 00:27:56.608]  code and laws from the libraries and trying to bar access to the law itself.
[00:27:56.928 --> 00:27:57.528]  It's pitiful.
[00:27:57.748 --> 00:28:00.569]  They are attacking us from every direction.
[00:28:00.949 --> 00:28:01.889]  Well, it's freedom, sir.
[00:28:01.949 --> 00:28:02.770]  I appreciate the call.
[00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:03.190]  Take care.
[00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:05.250]  I mean, government can do no wrong.
[00:28:05.271 --> 00:28:07.811]  I agree with the yuppies and the neocons and liberals.
[00:28:08.131 --> 00:28:09.332]  Government's God, okay?
[00:28:09.492 --> 00:28:11.072]  And just how dare you.
[00:28:11.152 --> 00:28:12.273]  George in Canada.
[00:28:12.533 --> 00:28:13.073]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:28:13.493 --> 00:28:16.354]  Well, carry on a little bit from where your last caller left off.
[00:28:16.394 --> 00:28:17.895]  Remember Nazi Germany, too.
[00:28:18.475 --> 00:28:22.637]  When a Jewish guy had a nice store, and the Nazi guy says, I like.
[00:28:23.958 --> 00:28:27.799]  He got just a fraction of the value of what his store was worth.
[00:28:27.819 --> 00:28:33.162]  Well, after they were done with that store, and the other Germans snickered, then the Gestapo said, I want your store.
[00:28:33.562 --> 00:28:33.922]  Exactly.
[00:28:33.942 --> 00:28:35.563]  And they'd say, well, I have blonde hair and blue eyes.
[00:28:35.703 --> 00:28:37.224]  Yes, but you're secretly a traitor.
[00:28:37.624 --> 00:28:38.764]  I want your wife, too.
[00:28:39.045 --> 00:28:41.966]  You're going to disappear and go to a work camp, Klaus.
[00:28:42.848 --> 00:28:43.348]  Exactly.
[00:28:43.568 --> 00:28:45.449]  It's all part of the freedom.
[00:28:46.229 --> 00:28:47.050]  The new freedom.
[00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:53.072]  Anyway, what I called about is the CIA has an investment arm.
[00:28:53.092 --> 00:28:54.352]  I don't know if you knew about that.
[00:28:54.813 --> 00:28:56.193]  Yes, a very loving organization.
[00:28:56.253 --> 00:28:56.613]  Go ahead.
[00:28:56.693 --> 00:28:57.034]  Q-Tel?
[00:28:57.514 --> 00:28:57.734]  Yes.
[00:28:57.954 --> 00:29:03.336]  And then when we see all these terrorist warnings and threats, things happen.
[00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:05.200]  Like, you know things are going to happen.
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:05.541]  The U.S.
[00:29:05.581 --> 00:29:06.581]  dollar is going to go down.
[00:29:06.641 --> 00:29:07.721]  The Swiss franc goes up.
[00:29:07.921 --> 00:29:09.122]  The oil explodes.
[00:29:09.502 --> 00:29:19.225]  If oil's futures are going to explode, certain companies that are affected by the crackdown, whether they have residents in a certain building or they do business in a certain area, their stocks are going to be affected.
[00:29:19.565 --> 00:29:24.627]  And having prior knowledge of this material means that you can make a tidy sum of cash.
[00:29:25.225 --> 00:29:26.206]  Well, they always do.
[00:29:26.286 --> 00:29:27.847]  We always track it right back to them.
[00:29:27.867 --> 00:29:30.549]  We did it again this time and nothing's going to happen to them.
[00:29:30.949 --> 00:29:33.291]  A trillion-two is missing from the Pentagon, George.
[00:29:33.772 --> 00:29:34.812]  And no one gets in trouble.
[00:29:34.832 --> 00:29:36.594]  It's all part of freedom.
[00:29:36.914 --> 00:29:39.956]  Why don't you just submit to government and just be a slave?
[00:29:39.976 --> 00:29:41.057]  Never.
[00:29:41.397 --> 00:29:42.258]  It's your place.
[00:29:43.299 --> 00:29:44.720]  Anything else you want to add?
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.121]  Yeah, I'll put in a couple more things.
[00:29:46.161 --> 00:29:48.543]  Well, you just stay right there and learn to submit.
[00:29:51.537 --> 00:29:54.540]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.461 --> 00:29:58.144]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.644 --> 00:30:09.128]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?

[00:30:14.011 --> 00:30:21.056]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:21.437 --> 00:30:27.541]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:27.681 --> 00:30:28.902]  There are no side effects.
[00:30:29.242 --> 00:30:32.183]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.

[00:33:06.506 --> 00:33:22.716]  Our trusted military leader, Tommy Franks, was outstomping on television going, gee, it's sad to say, but it's what we need after an attack.
[00:33:22.796 --> 00:33:25.598]  Martial law in the constitutional government.
[00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:28.539]  It's what you get after another attack.
[00:33:28.599 --> 00:33:30.981]  I'm sorry the terrorists are going to do this to us, but
[00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:36.495]  You know the government just hates running things and dominating and enslaving.
[00:33:37.536 --> 00:33:42.381]  But it's something we're willing to do if we have to.
[00:33:42.481 --> 00:33:43.662]  George in Canada.
[00:33:44.182 --> 00:33:48.987]  Yes, I pointed out on Monday that insider trading was a big part of these latest fake terror alerts.
[00:33:49.868 --> 00:33:52.150]  And by think, I might say on the Globals won't blow something up.
[00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:52.731]  I'm sure they will.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.673]  They want to enslave us and they need that pretext.
[00:33:55.713 --> 00:34:06.836]  But also it was about having the fear for the announcement of we've got to have a domestic intelligence agency outside Congress with no one having any oversight or control running all the other agencies.
[00:34:07.837 --> 00:34:11.618]  And it also makes the government and the black scheme mask look like our savior.
[00:34:11.638 --> 00:34:18.120]  So it's all part of this bathing the consciousness in total tyranny and darkest despotism.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.141]  But go ahead and finish up, George.
[00:34:20.777 --> 00:34:21.678]  Oh, exactly, Alex.
[00:34:21.738 --> 00:34:26.380]  Like, when credible information comes in, like one classic one was the African Embassy attacks.
[00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:35.105]  The New York Times published on their front page when that happened that a man went to the embassy every day for a year until he was thrown out, telling them that they were going to be attacked.
[00:34:35.885 --> 00:34:41.108]  So, obviously, it was something that was allowed to happen, or the people in charge were extremely stupid.
[00:34:41.508 --> 00:34:47.371]  Well, at the very same time, Al-Qaeda is being given over $50 million by Bill Clinton publicly to attack the Serbs.
[00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:48.450]  Exactly.
[00:34:48.490 --> 00:34:50.571]  They are agents of the... It's admitted!
[00:34:50.651 --> 00:34:51.292]  It's public!
[00:34:51.352 --> 00:34:53.373]  I mean, this is not debatable!
[00:34:53.473 --> 00:34:55.694]  They are going to try to do another terrorist attack.
[00:34:55.734 --> 00:35:04.098]  I still think that they're going to try to do what was in the Glass House tapes, is attack their own convention in New York and use that to get maximum sympathy for Bush and the Republicans.
[00:35:04.118 --> 00:35:09.641]  And again, for those who don't know about that, it's an admittedly classified plan by Nixon to attack a convention.
[00:35:09.661 --> 00:35:10.362]  Tell folks about it.
[00:35:10.562 --> 00:35:10.982]  Exactly.
[00:35:11.042 --> 00:35:11.883]  His own convention.
[00:35:11.923 --> 00:35:14.604]  It was in a book called The Glass House Tapes by Lewis Tackwood.
[00:35:15.134 --> 00:35:20.518]  And a gentleman by the name of McCord was the head of security for the convention, a 19-year CIA veteran.
[00:35:20.558 --> 00:35:21.259]  He was arrested.
[00:35:21.299 --> 00:35:23.180]  The whole thing fell apart after the break-ins.
[00:35:24.081 --> 00:35:28.344]  And what they planned to do was hire anarchists or street people to attack the police.
[00:35:28.404 --> 00:35:31.247]  The police attacked the anarchists, caused a big melee in the street.
[00:35:31.907 --> 00:35:40.534]  And then, surreptitiously, certain elements of the intelligence agencies and the White House would have planted explosives in the convention.
[00:35:41.058 --> 00:35:46.399]  And they would have gone off killing a couple of delegates, giving Nixon a cause to declare martial law.
[00:35:46.759 --> 00:35:47.540]  Well, wait a minute!
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:55.462]  I mean, the government will lock a young military officer up in a room and nerve gas him to death just to test nerve gas.
[00:35:56.142 --> 00:35:58.402]  They wouldn't do anything bad like that to us.
[00:35:58.622 --> 00:35:59.543]  Well, they always have.
[00:35:59.643 --> 00:36:01.803]  It's just sometimes we've been ignorant of it in the past.
[00:36:01.823 --> 00:36:03.023]  No, government's not bad.
[00:36:03.123 --> 00:36:04.944]  Government is sweet and loving and good.
[00:36:05.244 --> 00:36:08.485]  I wish, but sometimes you get mummy dearest or government dearest.
[00:36:08.525 --> 00:36:09.365]  This time we have that.
[00:36:09.745 --> 00:36:13.707]  Well, can't we just be subservient minions and just trust them?
[00:36:14.347 --> 00:36:16.108]  Well, we tried that.
[00:36:16.168 --> 00:36:32.215]  You saw, like, most of the people that died in the Holocaust tried that option, to say, well, if I just go along with them another day... Well, you know, that's quandary for me, because if criticizing the government's evil, and all government is good and godlike, and we should just submit and trust them,
[00:36:33.146 --> 00:36:34.646]  Well, then how could Hitler be bad?
[00:36:34.686 --> 00:36:35.967]  Or how could Stalin be bad?
[00:36:36.187 --> 00:36:38.267]  He wasn't bad to the people that are in power today.
[00:36:38.327 --> 00:36:39.688]  I'm sure they're probably role models.
[00:36:40.428 --> 00:36:47.230]  Oh, actually, Homeland Security, all the terms, the same people that put Hitler and Stalin in are running things today, the same families.
[00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:47.990]  Exactly.
[00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:54.192]  But remember, when push comes to shove, if the six million stood up like the Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising,
[00:36:54.758 --> 00:36:56.659]  Would World War II have gone as far as it did?
[00:36:56.699 --> 00:36:59.061]  Would there have been the overwhelming Holocaust?
[00:36:59.341 --> 00:37:00.702]  They're cowards, generally.
[00:37:00.742 --> 00:37:02.524]  They like total power, total control.
[00:37:02.904 --> 00:37:12.011]  When things come back at them, and they're outside of control, and they have no power over you, or that they can take the wounds or casualties themselves, they run very quickly.
[00:37:12.031 --> 00:37:16.194]  What do you think of the Pentagon putting ads out for people, a lot of the American people?
[00:37:17.014 --> 00:37:21.695]  Just all we need, we need, you know, deception agents to plant fake news stories.
[00:37:21.895 --> 00:37:23.335]  Please apply with us.
[00:37:23.796 --> 00:37:26.356]  Well, I praise them for bringing it out.
[00:37:26.456 --> 00:37:32.257]  What I despise is when that happened, they brought that up on a local talk radio show in Hamilton, Ontario.
[00:37:32.758 --> 00:37:37.699]  And the fascist who does the morning show there, you know, would still try to shoot you down.
[00:37:37.739 --> 00:37:43.020]  And you'd pull out the article that was in, you know, all over the world basically about how we were going to be lied to.
[00:37:43.704 --> 00:37:51.668]  And, uh, you know, he would still say that, uh, you know, this is all a good thing and we must submit, uh, for, you know, propagandists like that.
[00:37:51.708 --> 00:37:59.893]  They must have gone to the Joseph Goebbels Charm School, but, uh, I say I praise them to some degree for their honesty, but I, I just laugh at the people for their gullibility to it.
[00:37:59.913 --> 00:38:00.973]  Well, that's the incredible thing.
[00:38:00.993 --> 00:38:10.338]  The Pentagon comes out and says, we're going to plant fake news stories and lie to you in an official press release two years ago, and then now they're doing it, and people are going, huh?
[00:38:10.418 --> 00:38:11.219]  No, they wouldn't lie.
[00:38:11.299 --> 00:38:11.839]  Thanks for the call.
[00:38:13.235 --> 00:38:15.597]  Folks, I mean, it's like the PMAC documents.
[00:38:15.637 --> 00:38:35.367]  We got Dick Cheney and Jeb Bush and Wolfowitz and all these people writing over a hundred white papers, putting it on their own website, and saying, Saddam isn't a threat, it's about oil, we're going to use it as a base, we're going to have a draft, we need helpful terror attacks on the order of Pearl Harbor to mobilize the people.
[00:38:36.547 --> 00:38:39.749]  And then you go, no, no, no, it isn't Richard Clark, it isn't
[00:38:40.812 --> 00:38:42.933]  O'Neill, Paul O'Neill saying all this.
[00:38:43.274 --> 00:38:44.434]  They can claim that's partisan.
[00:38:44.834 --> 00:38:46.736]  No, I mean, it's Dick Cheney!
[00:38:48.096 --> 00:38:51.278]  And you can hold it up and go, here's PNAC, he wrote it, here's his name on it.
[00:38:52.179 --> 00:38:53.219]  It's on his website.
[00:38:53.599 --> 00:38:54.400]  They know, though.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:39:02.164]  I mean, it's like the military coming out and saying, by 2025, the military will run clinics where we put brain chips in everyone.
[00:39:02.264 --> 00:39:04.786]  Everyone will accept it through PR and hype.
[00:39:05.518 --> 00:39:07.139]  And then people just go, it's not true.
[00:39:07.179 --> 00:39:19.384]  And I go, well here's army.mil of the dozens and dozens of civilian inmate labor camps that have been set up since the mid-eighties with federal prisoners working at them secretly.
[00:39:19.684 --> 00:39:23.406]  They declassified it in 1997 and expanded new camps.
[00:39:23.466 --> 00:39:26.347]  And here's a list of the camps and here's the phone number and the email
[00:39:27.047 --> 00:39:29.569]  of the army captain who's the public relations person.
[00:39:30.029 --> 00:39:31.750]  And people go, that's not true, you're a liar!
[00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:40.274]  I go, here, I mean, on my TV show, here's the web address, here is the army printout, here are the camps, now moving down to the state level.
[00:39:41.435 --> 00:39:48.038]  And understand, they had camps, folks, for at least ten years with people in them that they didn't even tell us about.
[00:39:48.058 --> 00:39:54.522]  There's a copy of that document from the army in my book, 9-11 Dissent and Tyranny, by the way.
[00:39:54.562 --> 00:39:55.002]  It's one of the
[00:39:55.843 --> 00:39:58.544]  50 plus photos and documents on it.
[00:40:00.805 --> 00:40:05.806]  I mean, you can give it to somebody with the Army's web address on it where they can type it in and go to the Army.
[00:40:06.707 --> 00:40:07.467]  And they'll deny it.
[00:40:07.487 --> 00:40:09.188]  I mean, they'll deny anything, folks!
[00:40:09.508 --> 00:40:10.508]  They'll deny it all!
[00:40:10.548 --> 00:40:11.748]  They just deny anything.
[00:40:11.788 --> 00:40:12.789]  To be cowardly?
[00:40:13.229 --> 00:40:15.410]  You just sit there and you make excuses.
[00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:17.450]  Mark in Connecticut.
[00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:18.311]  Mark, thanks for holding.
[00:40:18.331 --> 00:40:18.751]  Go ahead.
[00:40:19.511 --> 00:40:19.851]  Hi, Alex.
[00:40:19.931 --> 00:40:20.351]  It's Eric.
[00:40:20.852 --> 00:40:21.532]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:40:22.012 --> 00:40:22.252]  Hi.
[00:40:22.952 --> 00:40:25.093]  I talked to you yesterday about the meeting, the town meeting.
[00:40:25.512 --> 00:40:25.792]  Yes.
[00:40:26.052 --> 00:40:27.374]  We had the town meeting last night.
[00:40:27.454 --> 00:40:32.478]  I didn't have time to set up a video camera, but I think they had one already running at the town meeting.
[00:40:32.838 --> 00:40:35.080]  Yeah, that was probably aired on your cable, was it not?
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.281]  I believe it's going to be.
[00:40:36.401 --> 00:40:37.822]  It was like a delayed broadcast.
[00:40:37.842 --> 00:40:39.183]  Well, you need to get me a tape of that.
[00:40:39.423 --> 00:40:43.546]  Now, for those that weren't here yesterday, and you sent me the news article, it's true.
[00:40:43.626 --> 00:40:44.827]  Tell us the town, the place.
[00:40:45.128 --> 00:40:47.890]  They're merging your military with your city government.
[00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:48.610]  Tell us all about it.
[00:40:48.851 --> 00:40:49.311]  Okay, Alex.
[00:40:49.972 --> 00:40:50.392]  Well, for the
[00:40:51.016 --> 00:40:52.457]  record here for some background.
[00:40:52.757 --> 00:40:53.618]  East Line, Connecticut.
[00:40:53.638 --> 00:40:56.360]  It's about 100 miles east of New York.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:00.202]  It's in the southeast corner of the state on the coast on Long Island Sound.
[00:41:00.822 --> 00:41:20.375]  A proposal was put forth by the first selectman, Wayne Fraser, of the city, of the town, to go in league with the National Guard and basically team up under one facility, one complex, and it's referred to as a public safety complex.
[00:41:20.874 --> 00:41:22.896]  A public safety compact.
[00:41:22.976 --> 00:41:24.197]  But I have good news, Alex.
[00:41:25.277 --> 00:41:27.039]  It was shot down at last night's meeting.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.203]  Well they may say that, they may try to resurrect it, but good job.
[00:41:32.543 --> 00:41:35.905]  Yes, well what we did, we got up in front, and a lot of people were there.
[00:41:35.945 --> 00:41:39.288]  In fact, there's an article in today's paper, I will send you a copy of that.
[00:41:39.308 --> 00:41:42.550]  Yeah, email it to tips at infowars.com, my friend, and we'll post it.
[00:41:42.971 --> 00:41:47.334]  Okay, Alex, and I will also attempt to get you a video, but um... I'm begging for it.
[00:41:47.854 --> 00:41:49.816]  I will do my best.
[00:41:50.416 --> 00:41:52.498]  So describe what happened at this meeting.
[00:41:52.538 --> 00:41:55.120]  By the way, folks, this already happened in Austin.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.080]  We couldn't stop them.
[00:41:56.641 --> 00:41:59.323]  And the average idiot has no idea this is even going on.
[00:42:00.924 --> 00:42:01.805]  Tell us about your town.
[00:42:01.825 --> 00:42:03.226]  Tell us about the death camp, please.
[00:42:03.786 --> 00:42:04.767]  Yeah, well, I'll tell you.
[00:42:04.887 --> 00:42:09.310]  There were a lot of citizens concerned, of course, about the financial aspect.
[00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:10.051]  It was a lease.
[00:42:10.111 --> 00:42:12.553]  We wouldn't end up owning the building.
[00:42:13.999 --> 00:42:21.223]  Again, they were obsessed with petty issues, but this was merging your police, your emergency management, with the military, with a federal grant.
[00:42:21.303 --> 00:42:41.595]  Yes, and I wrote a letter to the editor, and I mentioned in the article, in my letter, the Cato report about the paramilitarization of the police, and several board members commented to me that that report helped them make an intelligent decision.
[00:42:42.355 --> 00:42:53.724]  Because these things, the militarization of the police has been happening so slowly, so inexorably, that many people don't even notice it until it's right at their back door.
[00:42:54.725 --> 00:43:00.749]  I mean, again, sir, they had at least 15,000 troops in plainclothes in 1989.
[00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:05.633]  Now I'm told it's over 100,000 secret police on the streets.
[00:43:06.353 --> 00:43:09.256]  I've talked to them, I've interviewed them, it's showed up in news articles.
[00:43:09.927 --> 00:43:21.530]  I mean, it is a giant KGB-Stasi-Gestapo force, and these are the 24% in the polls they give them, the questionnaires, will you fire on Americans?
[00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:22.950]  Will you confiscate guns?
[00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:24.950]  This is the 24%, folks.
[00:43:25.851 --> 00:43:30.432]  They get roughly triple the pay of someone of their same rank who's overseas.
[00:43:30.452 --> 00:43:36.133]  They get credit cards, nice cars, some got long hair and earrings, others are in business suits.
[00:43:37.088 --> 00:43:51.386]  They've got surveillance systems, weapons, you name it, and then when they really find criminals in these groups, then they've got smaller terrorist units in every city, folks, ready to just blow our towns to bits!
[00:43:52.107 --> 00:43:54.651]  And folks, I'm not joking around about this!
[00:43:55.459 --> 00:44:03.322]  Okay, I've been to the towns where they practice taking over, arresting the mayor, doing the whole nine yards, and these idiots in these local cities just buy into this.
[00:44:03.402 --> 00:44:05.423]  I mean, I've made three police state films, folks.
[00:44:05.463 --> 00:44:06.143]  I've got videos.
[00:44:06.443 --> 00:44:09.284]  Mayors, police chiefs, special forces troops.
[00:44:09.765 --> 00:44:11.145]  I mean, I've got them all admitting it.
[00:44:11.245 --> 00:44:13.226]  And then news articles and documents.
[00:44:14.546 --> 00:44:18.808]  Let me break this down for those that just joined us, Eric in Connecticut.
[00:44:20.369 --> 00:44:21.891]  Look at Iraq, okay?
[00:44:21.991 --> 00:44:22.731]  How does it work?
[00:44:22.911 --> 00:44:26.574]  Our troops go in, they set up a military base in every city.
[00:44:27.095 --> 00:44:29.797]  They then have their puppet government that's appointed.
[00:44:30.718 --> 00:44:32.019]  And that's how they control things.
[00:44:32.039 --> 00:44:33.060]  Well, it's the same thing here.
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:36.162]  In every city, in every county, they're setting up these bases.
[00:44:36.563 --> 00:44:44.950]  Now this new intelligence czar will be over all the CIA commanders, liaisons, uh, commissars, literally, political officers.
[00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:46.811]  It'll be over these command bunkers.
[00:44:47.952 --> 00:44:48.152]  And, uh,
[00:44:49.793 --> 00:44:50.234]  It's here!
[00:44:50.354 --> 00:44:50.996]  It's upon us!
[00:44:51.096 --> 00:44:54.582]  I mean, this is martial law right now!
[00:44:55.003 --> 00:44:57.307]  The infrastructure is in place, but...
[00:44:58.075 --> 00:45:09.423]  Hundreds of these towns and cities and counties do not have this in place yet, thousands do, and they're expanding them right now, and if people are just aware of this, you can stop it!
[00:45:09.463 --> 00:45:18.569]  Folks, it is totally unconstitutional, totally un-American, to have bivouacked police, military, command bunkers in your cities!
[00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:22.852]  Alex, I want to make it very clear to people that if they get involved,
[00:45:23.439 --> 00:45:28.523]  If they elect good town officials to these boards, which is what we had last night.
[00:45:28.564 --> 00:45:32.567]  This was some of the finest... You've got to stop electronic machines from going in the voting machines.
[00:45:33.067 --> 00:45:34.389]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:37.131]  And people can make a difference.
[00:45:37.151 --> 00:45:38.472]  You don't have those in your town, do you?
[00:45:38.532 --> 00:45:38.973]  No, we don't.
[00:45:39.173 --> 00:45:40.574]  Yeah, you will soon, unless you stop them.
[00:45:41.135 --> 00:45:41.876]  And that's the next thing.
[00:45:41.896 --> 00:45:44.158]  You've got to stop those.
[00:45:44.178 --> 00:45:47.600]  The minute those go in and their new people get in, they'll just smile at you.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.262]  Cops will walk in in black uniforms.
[00:45:49.442 --> 00:45:51.363]  You'll probably get arrested and beaten in the parking lot.
[00:45:51.483 --> 00:45:52.004]  I'm not kidding.
[00:45:52.044 --> 00:45:52.784]  It will happen to you.
[00:45:53.365 --> 00:45:55.647]  It's just hell on earth, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:55.967 --> 00:46:00.531]  We've got new machines in and these are new special detail security officers.
[00:46:00.751 --> 00:46:02.312]  You got a problem with that, Eric?
[00:46:04.079 --> 00:46:06.721]  I mean, look folks, if I'm yelling and screaming, this is freaking me out!
[00:46:07.102 --> 00:46:09.343]  But I'm glad you guys had this victory.
[00:46:09.924 --> 00:46:11.565]  So, what did some of the speakers say?
[00:46:11.585 --> 00:46:12.166]  What did you say?
[00:46:12.386 --> 00:46:18.751]  Well, I got up and I said that... I said, first of all, let me just say, I'm not against the cops.
[00:46:18.811 --> 00:46:19.912]  I'm not against good cops.
[00:46:20.092 --> 00:46:21.113]  I'm not against the guard.
[00:46:21.573 --> 00:46:25.196]  But I am... To me, it's like mixing chlorine and ammonia.
[00:46:25.316 --> 00:46:27.878]  They're good cleaners when they're separately used.
[00:46:28.198 --> 00:46:30.480]  But if you mix the two, you're going to get toxic byproducts.
[00:46:31.434 --> 00:46:39.559]  I said, the founders of this country knew very well the danger of a militarized police force or an overbearing standing army.
[00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:45.343]  And here we have the beginnings of the very thing the founders feared the most.
[00:46:45.383 --> 00:46:47.204]  We don't have the beginnings, my friend.
[00:46:47.264 --> 00:46:50.086]  We are well along in the disease process.
[00:46:50.246 --> 00:46:58.111]  Yep, and I cited the Third Amendment about the quartering of troops domestically during peacetime.
[00:46:58.624 --> 00:47:01.805]  I also cited the report which talks about the paramilitarization of the police.
[00:47:01.845 --> 00:47:15.230]  Yeah, that's what the founding father said is, the troops will come into the town, levy a tax, take over the biggest building, and just sit there and take people's chickens and push their wives around and, you know, this is it!
[00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:16.950]  It's like reconstruction in the South!
[00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:24.913]  See, and the biggest problem, Alex, is because the police officer is assigned to keep the peace and use a minimum of force.
[00:47:26.118 --> 00:47:28.780]  Yeah, they're peacekeepers, they're peace officers.
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:30.601]  And to respect the Constitution.
[00:47:30.921 --> 00:47:33.603]  And by the way, they are civilians just like us.
[00:47:33.623 --> 00:47:35.865]  Oh, and I made that point last night many, many times.
[00:47:35.965 --> 00:47:38.327]  Are they calling us the civilians?
[00:47:38.367 --> 00:47:39.588]  No, no, no, they're civilians.
[00:47:40.248 --> 00:47:42.650]  And that's the point that this briefing paper makes.
[00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:47.873]  And I said, the soldier's job is... Is there to kill people and break things.
[00:47:47.893 --> 00:47:48.674]  Exactly right.
[00:47:48.794 --> 00:47:51.476]  So when you mix the two, there's nothing but trouble.
[00:47:52.757 --> 00:47:55.919]  I will attempt to get you that video, Alex, and I will send you more information.
[00:47:55.979 --> 00:48:00.903]  I also have the connection to a possible military website that could be a bombshell.
[00:48:01.583 --> 00:48:03.485]  A friend of mine may have a copy of it.
[00:48:03.585 --> 00:48:05.086]  I tried to access it on the internet.
[00:48:05.146 --> 00:48:06.066]  The site was down.
[00:48:06.427 --> 00:48:10.029]  If I have to scan the thing, I'll scan it and send it to you in the form of a PDF.
[00:48:10.189 --> 00:48:11.270]  You're absolutely amazing.
[00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:11.991]  Thanks for the call.
[00:48:13.872 --> 00:48:15.613]  By the way, you talk about a bombshell.
[00:48:15.693 --> 00:48:16.954]  I got a call last night.
[00:48:16.974 --> 00:48:21.117]  I got the phone number, and I've confirmed part of it, and it's a big news story.
[00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:31.371]  Let's just say one of the biggest hotels in the country, Hotel Change, secretly searches your car when it's in their parking lot.
[00:48:32.191 --> 00:48:37.832]  And they have face scanning cameras, and they search your car if they can get a hold of your keys if you use the valet.
[00:48:38.572 --> 00:48:40.293]  For guns, drugs, to fight terror.
[00:48:41.373 --> 00:48:44.934]  No warrant, no nothing, and of course you know they're already searching your rooms.
[00:48:45.654 --> 00:48:49.134]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[00:48:49.174 --> 00:48:52.155]  Let's talk to Rob in South Carolina, then Emmett,
[00:48:52.893 --> 00:48:53.614]  Michael and others.
[00:48:53.694 --> 00:48:54.414]  Rob, go ahead.
[00:48:54.854 --> 00:49:01.559]  Hey Alex, I was just willing to let you know that I found this article about 3,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate stolen in North Carolina.
[00:49:01.579 --> 00:49:05.482]  So they're probably planning on like an Oklahoma City kind of bombing again.
[00:49:05.502 --> 00:49:14.808]  Well, I mean every month there's, you know, oh, fertilizer is missing and then it turns out it's an insurance scam or somebody forgot to pay for something or
[00:49:15.573 --> 00:49:17.274]  Uh, you know, it's an accounting error.
[00:49:17.334 --> 00:49:18.916]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[00:49:18.976 --> 00:49:27.442]  I mean, sure, they could be creating the history, you know, so they can do something like this, but... And they're saying terrorists are planning to attack with truck bombs any minute, and... And who knows?
[00:49:27.462 --> 00:49:28.422]  The globalists might do that.
[00:49:28.442 --> 00:49:30.023]  You never know when they're really gonna drop the hammer.
[00:49:30.604 --> 00:49:32.485]  Oh, yeah, but I'll send you the article if you want it.
[00:49:32.705 --> 00:49:33.306]  Sure, yeah.
[00:49:33.626 --> 00:49:33.866]  Alright.
[00:49:34.687 --> 00:49:35.207]  Anything else?
[00:49:35.567 --> 00:49:36.048]  No, that's it.
[00:49:36.728 --> 00:49:37.369]  Thanks for the call.
[00:49:37.809 --> 00:49:40.571]  Yeah, there was a bombing in Nashville a few weeks ago.
[00:49:41.602 --> 00:49:44.104]  And I never heard about it until someone sent me the article a week after.
[00:49:44.744 --> 00:49:47.246]  And I was surprised it never made really national news.
[00:49:47.286 --> 00:49:49.087]  The car just blew up in the parking lot.
[00:49:49.127 --> 00:49:50.888]  I mean, blew up big time.
[00:49:51.768 --> 00:49:54.050]  And, uh, what's behind that?
[00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:56.991]  Well, the government carries out a lot of terror attacks.
[00:49:57.031 --> 00:50:04.236]  There's been over a hundred in the last three years that they don't announce, but they tell the cops about it.
[00:50:04.356 --> 00:50:05.737]  Men see we're under attack.
[00:50:06.097 --> 00:50:07.178]  That's why we're doing all this.
[00:50:07.218 --> 00:50:09.559]  You're the only ones that are being let in on this.
[00:50:09.859 --> 00:50:11.060]  You can't tell anybody.
[00:50:11.932 --> 00:50:14.834]  And so, really, the whole country's already on red alert.
[00:50:16.034 --> 00:50:19.976]  And the police, most police, mid-level police, high-level police, know this.
[00:50:20.677 --> 00:50:24.419]  And so that's how they manipulate the police, is with false intelligence.
[00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:31.362]  We'll come back and talk to Emmett and Michael and many, many others.
[00:50:31.382 --> 00:50:31.662]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:31.682 --> 00:50:37.405]  And when we get back, I will briefly, quickly, in an expeditious
[00:50:39.991 --> 00:50:49.355]  In judicious fashion, give you the phone number and mailing address to get my great videos and the books and other key information that we offer.
[00:50:49.935 --> 00:50:51.216]  And we've got some guests coming up.
[00:50:51.256 --> 00:50:52.397]  And of course your phone calls.
[00:50:52.817 --> 00:50:57.059]  PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com are the websites.
[00:50:57.439 --> 00:50:58.439]  Please stay with us.
[00:50:58.459 --> 00:50:59.900]  The transmission shall continue.
[00:51:01.289 --> 00:51:08.115]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.455 --> 00:51:09.817]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.017 --> 00:51:12.219]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.359 --> 00:51:14.461]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:14.741 --> 00:51:19.665]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.005 --> 00:51:24.029]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.269 --> 00:51:26.051]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.131 --> 00:51:36.783]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:36.943 --> 00:51:38.806]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[00:52:02.451 --> 00:52:06.554]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:52:06.694 --> 00:52:09.556]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:52:09.656 --> 00:52:16.362]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:52:16.542 --> 00:52:19.564]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:52:19.764 --> 00:52:22.146]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:52:22.266 --> 00:52:30.173]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:52:30.373 --> 00:52:41.759]  Caprazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:49.664]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:49.684 --> 00:52:50.124]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:52:50.184 --> 00:52:51.845]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:53:01.442 --> 00:53:01.983]  Thank you.
[00:53:16.804 --> 00:53:17.465]  We're good to go.

[00:54:03.915 --> 00:54:09.936]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:10.536 --> 00:54:13.517]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:23.499 --> 00:54:27.780]  Folks, I mean, if I get obnoxious and angry, it's because
[00:54:29.278 --> 00:54:32.000]  I love this country, and they're killing America!
[00:54:32.261 --> 00:54:48.534]  The United States of America is being butchered scientifically, and they've hired the former KGB chief who was in the Associated Press two years ago to consult Homeland Security on how to set up their internal system.
[00:54:48.614 --> 00:54:49.595]  I mean, what?
[00:54:50.395 --> 00:54:50.736]  What?
[00:54:51.877 --> 00:54:54.619]  Generals are on TV talking about martial law?
[00:54:55.079 --> 00:54:58.262]  Did you see General Franks on TV last night?
[00:55:00.919 --> 00:55:02.841]  I mean, you know, this makes me angry.
[00:55:02.981 --> 00:55:04.082]  I love this country.
[00:55:05.043 --> 00:55:09.206]  I love my family more than I love this country that lives in this country.
[00:55:09.907 --> 00:55:12.770]  That's why you're supposed to love your country, because it's the place where your family lives.
[00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:16.633]  And if it's a free country, you love it because it makes your family free and happy.
[00:55:18.395 --> 00:55:22.018]  Our beautiful country is being turned into a nightmare because of a bunch of criminals.
[00:55:22.959 --> 00:55:26.522]  Corporate raiders, looters of the government, are running things!
[00:55:26.782 --> 00:55:28.883]  I mean, look at all the crimes you know they've committed!
[00:55:29.123 --> 00:55:31.425]  All the things they've done, whether it's Kerry or Bush!
[00:55:33.366 --> 00:55:39.190]  We've got a pack of pirates owning high-tech PR firms, busting this country up!
[00:55:39.611 --> 00:55:41.352]  Just busting this country up!
[00:55:42.252 --> 00:55:44.274]  And it makes my blood boil!
[00:55:46.391 --> 00:55:47.513]  I know we've got a lot of phone lines.
[00:55:47.533 --> 00:55:51.237]  We've got a guest coming up too where you try to go to a football game and there's troops searching you.
[00:55:51.558 --> 00:55:55.042]  Part of the private secret police in military uniforms.
[00:55:55.422 --> 00:55:57.345]  Got photos of this on InfoWars.com.
[00:55:59.338 --> 00:56:11.167]  But I do want to encourage every single one of you to visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com if you're online and to stop procrastinating and to get 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, my two excellent 9-11 films.
[00:56:11.607 --> 00:56:21.955]  We're carrying Eric Humphrey's great 9-11 video, 9-11, Painful Deceptions, George Humphrey's new 9-11 video, 9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati,
[00:56:23.773 --> 00:56:30.079]  We're also carrying a bunch of other great books and videos and books on tape by other authors and researchers.
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:34.864]  Just visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and produce all the titles and the films.
[00:56:35.484 --> 00:56:38.047]  There's a bunch of different specials on videos and books.
[00:56:39.401 --> 00:56:40.422]  You call the toll-free number.

[00:56:45.304 --> 00:56:45.544]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:57.189 --> 00:56:58.890]  My films are all over 2 hours long.
[00:56:58.970 --> 00:57:01.011]  Some are 2 hours 44 minutes long.
[00:57:01.691 --> 00:57:03.252]  2 hours 24 minutes long, you know.
[00:57:03.793 --> 00:57:06.594]  They're all over 2 hours, so they're $25.95 a piece.

[00:57:21.202 --> 00:57:25.504]  And specials, you get 2 or more of any of those videos.
[00:57:26.696 --> 00:57:36.458]  You can write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704, or 1-888-253-3139.
[00:57:36.738 --> 00:57:40.119]  Emmett in Pennsylvania, then Michael and others.
[00:57:40.259 --> 00:57:40.799]  Go ahead, Emmett.
[00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:51.262]  Yes, I urge your listeners to access C.C., C. Caldwell, C-A-L-D-W-E-L-L, at patriotnews.com.
[00:57:52.739 --> 00:57:59.525]  A man was taken, this is Pennsylvania, Dutch country, and a man was taken into the hospital with irregular heartbeat.
[00:58:00.605 --> 00:58:03.668]  And they even tested his blood and found no alcohol in it.
[00:58:04.349 --> 00:58:06.110]  However, they asked him, does he drink?
[00:58:06.290 --> 00:58:09.032]  And the man said, I drink a six-pack at home at night.
[00:58:10.073 --> 00:58:14.737]  Pennsylvania state law requires... And so they withdrew his driver's license?
[00:58:14.757 --> 00:58:15.898]  Yes, uh-huh.
[00:58:16.358 --> 00:58:19.501]  And the state law requires physicians to report patients
[00:58:20.678 --> 00:58:23.359]  Uh, do they believe have a condition that would prevent them?
[00:58:23.379 --> 00:58:26.259]  No, I read that article two weeks ago and I meant to get that guy on.
[00:58:26.739 --> 00:58:27.359]  Oh, good.
[00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:31.600]  Yeah, email me that article again because I probably won't find it and I'll get him on.
[00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:32.721]  Alright, I will.
[00:58:33.041 --> 00:58:34.001]  Hey, have you heard the latest?
[00:58:34.061 --> 00:58:37.182]  People who have pro-life bumper stickers are being pulled over and harassed.
[00:58:37.942 --> 00:58:42.003]  People who read from Bible passages at city council meetings are being beat up and arrested.
[00:58:42.803 --> 00:58:44.443]  Oh my, yes, I'll mail you this.
[00:58:44.483 --> 00:58:45.583]  Well, you know, just stay there.
[00:58:45.623 --> 00:58:48.904]  We'll talk about all the freedom we're getting from our Christian conservative leaders when we get back.
[00:58:57.705 --> 00:59:01.868]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.529 --> 00:59:03.350]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.110 --> 00:59:05.031]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.491 --> 00:59:09.354]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.855 --> 00:59:13.978]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:18.702]  Alright, my friends, into hour number two.
[00:59:18.802 --> 00:59:21.404]  We have a gentleman joining us from Pensacola, Florida.
[00:59:22.896 --> 00:59:27.358]  who took photographs of the new Special Seeker Police that aren't so new.
[00:59:27.378 --> 00:59:36.403]  They've been around since the early 1980s out searching people's bags, checking their driver's license to get into a college football game.
[00:59:36.423 --> 00:59:47.888]  And then all over the country I have, what, three reports today, one out of a local newspaper, one out of Reuters, and one out of AP of troops now aren't just going to be on the trains and the bus stations, now they're going to be on the highways.
[00:59:48.009 --> 00:59:50.590]  Well, yeah, News 8 out of Des Moines, Iowa
[00:59:51.171 --> 00:59:53.698]  Right after 9-11 said, you've seen the troops in the uh...
[00:59:55.057 --> 00:59:58.179]  You've seen the troops in the airports, now we're going to be on the road, checkpoints.
[00:59:58.219 --> 01:00:01.161]  And it shows them searching a woman's car on the side of the highway.
[01:00:01.481 --> 01:00:02.642]  Folks, that isn't freedom.
[01:00:02.662 --> 01:00:05.163]  That's the end of posse comitatus, that's martial law.
[01:00:05.703 --> 01:00:09.706]  And Tommy French has been spouting off again on national TV this time.
[01:00:09.746 --> 01:00:14.408]  I didn't see it, but I talked to a talk show host this morning who saw it, and we got a bunch of emails about it.
[01:00:14.448 --> 01:00:15.009]  Did you see it?
[01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:21.873]  About how, well, after the next attack we got a martial law, and that's too bad, but it's what the people want, and we'll do it, don't worry.
[01:00:22.673 --> 01:00:28.079]  Emmett in Pennsylvania, then Michael, Ralph, Tim, and a bunch of other people.
[01:00:28.119 --> 01:00:29.940]  Go ahead and finish up what you were saying, Emmett.
[01:00:30.221 --> 01:00:37.227]  Well, I don't want to give them ideas, but they're complaining about writing the Ten Commandments on public buildings.
[01:00:38.368 --> 01:00:41.331]  I have a local church here that plays beautiful chimes.
[01:00:41.831 --> 01:00:44.074]  I wonder when they're going to complain and say that's
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:48.543]  Air pollution and they can't play the chimes any longer.
[01:00:48.583 --> 01:00:53.929]  Well, when they arrest or harass pro-life bumper stickers, they say, well, people have a right not to see that.
[01:00:57.305 --> 01:01:06.130]  Delaware, earlier this week, they arrested and on camera beat up a Christian who read from a passage in the Bible criticizing homosexuality.
[01:01:06.451 --> 01:01:18.558]  Whether you agree with it or you think it's bad, the point is he has a First Amendment right, and just like the, you know, protesters are put in a cage, in a cage, under a building, you know, the anti-war protesters, well, you know, most of those anti-war
[01:01:18.578 --> 01:01:20.360]  Well, thank the Lord here in Pennsylvania.
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:22.441]  They passed the law that similar sexes cannot marry.
[01:01:44.686 --> 01:01:49.209]  Yeah, you mentioned the KGB earlier, just kind of reminded me of the Red Dawn thing.
[01:01:49.289 --> 01:02:01.938]  It's almost like soon we'll be hearing, you know, coded messages of chairs against the wall, John has a long mustache, or whatever, you know, like was in that movie where there was an actual hot invasion of the United States.
[01:02:02.238 --> 01:02:04.020]  Instead of a cold, creeping one.
[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:07.842]  Yeah, except for 9-11, of course, which is a nice big pageant.
[01:02:09.864 --> 01:02:12.425]  Have you interviewed Dave on his
[01:02:13.867 --> 01:02:15.468]  9-1-1 in plain sight video.
[01:02:15.508 --> 01:02:16.708]  I don't get to listen every day.
[01:02:16.968 --> 01:02:17.509]  No, I haven't.
[01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:22.170]  It's just so... I don't know.
[01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:36.196]  It's just... The people that are in the 9-11 truth movement, or that are trying to expose this, it is just so cheap for infighting among people to occur, and it's so obvious.
[01:02:36.236 --> 01:02:43.259]  There's this one site that debunks his film as being, you know, one of the pod people.
[01:02:44.165 --> 01:02:54.800]  And it shows a 757 on takeoff with one of its landing gear bay doors open and says, see, here's what they're saying as a pod.
[01:02:55.242 --> 01:02:58.464]  Because those gear don't close up both at the same time.
[01:02:58.524 --> 01:03:01.666]  Well, I support what Dave's doing, and I think his video's great.
[01:03:01.686 --> 01:03:03.587]  Well, there's some... You know what?
[01:03:04.167 --> 01:03:18.295]  We're just asking the questions, and I think it's good to ask the questions, and there's a lot of people that try to monopolize the 9-11 Truth Movement and say that they have the only truth and they're the grand poobah, and I just ignore all those people.
[01:03:18.495 --> 01:03:21.197]  Like the debunking websites that, you know, talk about
[01:03:22.318 --> 01:03:27.882]  You know, there are some stupid emails out there, chain emails and things, but they almost claim to have... Well, you know what?
[01:03:27.922 --> 01:03:32.325]  Let's just move forward and expose the New World Order and just ignore all the infighting.
[01:03:32.485 --> 01:03:39.930]  Well, um... I did have a point about the film, though, if I can hang on through the break.
[01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:41.071]  Well, you can finish up real quick.
[01:03:41.091 --> 01:03:44.013]  We've got a guest coming on right now, but I'll let you finish up on the other side.
[01:03:44.454 --> 01:03:45.694]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com.
[01:03:55.521 --> 01:04:01.026]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:04:01.447 --> 01:04:05.991]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:04:06.111 --> 01:04:12.958]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:04:13.318 --> 01:04:19.444]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:04:19.584 --> 01:04:20.785]  There are no side effects.
[01:04:21.125 --> 01:04:24.066]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:04:24.226 --> 01:04:26.247]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:04:26.547 --> 01:04:33.790]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:04:34.090 --> 01:04:37.451]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:04:37.891 --> 01:04:41.033]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[01:04:41.053 --> 01:04:41.153]  866-885-6625.
[01:04:41.173 --> 01:04:41.353]  866-885-6625.
[01:04:41.393 --> 01:04:42.333]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:04:42.354 --> 01:04:42.554]  Call today.
[01:04:52.802 --> 01:04:57.145]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:04:57.326 --> 01:05:01.749]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:05:01.909 --> 01:05:06.253]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:05:06.293 --> 01:05:07.654]  The New World Order.
[01:05:09.455 --> 01:05:13.676]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:05:13.736 --> 01:05:20.679]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:05:20.799 --> 01:05:22.800]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:33.607]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:05:33.787 --> 01:05:39.191]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:05:39.691 --> 01:05:43.194]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:05:43.214 --> 01:05:43.594]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:05:43.614 --> 01:05:45.355]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:55.463]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:05:55.503 --> 01:05:59.686]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:05:59.947 --> 01:06:02.729]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:06:02.929 --> 01:06:05.331]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:06:05.511 --> 01:06:14.158]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:06:14.358 --> 01:06:15.699]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:20.043]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:06:20.103 --> 01:06:20.823]  We're good to go!
[01:06:49.181 --> 01:06:50.802]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:06:53.885 --> 01:06:59.449]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:59.489 --> 01:06:59.889]  Right after 9-11,
[01:07:20.569 --> 01:07:26.934]  They said, ooh, the Neighborhood Watch is being trained to spy on their neighbors to fight all terrorism and crime.
[01:07:26.954 --> 01:07:31.337]  We're going to have local volunteer paramilitary groups to graduate from high school.
[01:07:31.357 --> 01:07:35.500]  You'll have to serve 20, 30 hours a week in these tattletale squads.
[01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:36.921]  And we have all these articles.
[01:07:38.823 --> 01:07:42.886]  And since then, all over the country, whether it's the Super Bowl, the Kentucky Derby,
[01:07:44.830 --> 01:08:01.462]  Anything and everything, troops show up and search people and check them and they show up on the highway and then we started getting reports in Alabama and other states of generally 65-55 year old people in military police uniforms.
[01:08:01.502 --> 01:08:07.286]  I got these calls out at checkpoints, on the road, at football games searching people.
[01:08:09.398 --> 01:08:11.779]  And then, when you'd ask them, are you military, they'd say, no.
[01:08:11.819 --> 01:08:13.440]  You ask the police, no, but we like them.
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:15.160]  Well, then they're wearing military uniforms.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:19.902]  Well, we found out they really are the military, and it's a weird program, at least in Alabama.
[01:08:20.582 --> 01:08:23.183]  We have photos of this on Infowars.com right now.
[01:08:23.223 --> 01:08:30.085]  We'll describe those photos and go over it with the gentleman that got us all this information, Bob Stevens.
[01:08:30.486 --> 01:08:36.428]  Before we do that, though, let's let a caller, Michael in Kentucky, finish up with what he was talking about.
[01:08:36.448 --> 01:08:36.948]  Go ahead, Michael.
[01:08:37.668 --> 01:08:42.649]  I'll let you get on to your gas there, but I just want to say you know who this is.
[01:08:42.749 --> 01:08:45.930]  I'm a community broadcaster and I've aired some of your tapes.
[01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:49.911]  Dave sent me his film or video and I've aired it.
[01:08:50.572 --> 01:09:04.695]  I've also covered the criticisms and saying that there's debunkers out there, but that's one thing about a lot of these people selling tapes or offering tapes is that Dave offers it for review to people if they want to air it.
[01:09:05.956 --> 01:09:06.836]  These critics are
[01:09:07.478 --> 01:09:08.098]  Not doing that.
[01:09:08.138 --> 01:09:13.041]  They want your 20 bucks or whatever, and not even offering that to people that are in the media.
[01:09:13.081 --> 01:09:17.184]  And I think that says something about the effort there to get the information out.
[01:09:17.204 --> 01:09:27.630]  If some of these people are really the ones that criticize the truth movement, and putting out disinformation of their own, why aren't they offering those tapes?
[01:09:27.790 --> 01:09:30.071]  That's basically all I had to say, and I'll let you get to your guests.
[01:09:30.091 --> 01:09:31.872]  I had a few other points, but you need to move on.
[01:09:32.413 --> 01:09:32.733]  Alright.
[01:09:33.613 --> 01:09:34.394]  Well, thank you for the call.
[01:09:34.414 --> 01:09:35.654]  I appreciate it.
[01:09:35.694 --> 01:09:36.535]  Take care, my friend.
[01:09:37.361 --> 01:09:52.732]  You know, I personally have been successful with the biggest alternative, what you'd call patriot, Christian libertarian radio show in the country because I let the callers say what they want, but I don't spend my time on this stuff.
[01:09:53.572 --> 01:09:58.456]  I mean, when people criticize and attack me, even when newspapers do it now most of the time, I don't even cover the article.
[01:09:59.116 --> 01:10:00.557]  It's about the information.
[01:10:01.098 --> 01:10:02.719]  It's about fighting the new world order.
[01:10:03.579 --> 01:10:05.401]  And there are a lot of people, you know, in the 9-11 movement,
[01:10:06.829 --> 01:10:07.550]  Who've attacked me?
[01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:11.052]  I mean, I've had them attack me and say the Patriot Act II didn't exist.
[01:10:11.072 --> 01:10:14.875]  And then when it came out that it finally did, they go, and still attack me.
[01:10:15.876 --> 01:10:20.239]  I mean, you know, I've been attacked on the most basic, approvable stuff, but I just ignore it.
[01:10:20.759 --> 01:10:29.326]  People don't want to tune in and hear all day about this person said that, and this person's fighting with that person, and most of these Patriot groups out there, that's all they do is fight with each other.
[01:10:29.366 --> 01:10:31.888]  Their websites are about half infighting.
[01:10:32.805 --> 01:10:37.708]  And I don't do that, and I know Dave doesn't do that, but I don't even spend time responding to this stuff.
[01:10:37.848 --> 01:10:38.988]  I mean, it just doesn't even matter.
[01:10:40.989 --> 01:10:46.412]  Again, it gets us off the fact that the government's about to carry out more terror attacks to totally kill this country.
[01:10:47.853 --> 01:10:49.113]  To totally destroy our freedoms.
[01:10:49.854 --> 01:11:00.619]  And I would challenge people just to keep looking forward and keep the info salvos going downrange.
[01:11:01.738 --> 01:11:03.279]  I mean, that's what I challenge people to do.
[01:11:04.859 --> 01:11:08.240]  Because I'm just here to get people to think for themselves.
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:09.281]  To get them involved.
[01:11:09.361 --> 01:11:12.822]  To get them to realize what's happened in history and what's happening again.
[01:11:14.283 --> 01:11:16.283]  Alright, let me go over some of this.
[01:11:17.624 --> 01:11:20.565]  MPs at the Senior Bowl in Alabama.
[01:11:22.495 --> 01:11:39.273]  Even though he was told the MPs he photographed weren't military, a quick glance at the Alabama State Defense Forces website reveals, quote, on December 30th, 1983, the Alabama State Military Department issued Order Number 100-2 authorizing the ALSDF, Cadre Strength of 500,
[01:11:40.294 --> 01:11:46.581]  With mobilization strength of 5,000, the first commander of ALSDF was Major General M.G.
[01:11:46.842 --> 01:11:48.363]  Herman A. Price, Jr.
[01:11:48.403 --> 01:11:54.791]  During the Gulf War, the Alabama National Guard was activated in ALSDF, provided family support and family assistance.
[01:11:56.192 --> 01:12:02.095]  27 ALSDF members were called to active duty to render this service AING unit members.
[01:12:02.155 --> 01:12:03.155]  See, that's how it starts.
[01:12:03.255 --> 01:12:11.480]  It's, oh, we're going to take old military retirees, give them a uniform, and you're going to go out and give support when a car is broken down or a family doesn't have money.
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:16.082]  A kind of a welfare front line for troops' families, which I think is great.
[01:12:16.703 --> 01:12:22.826]  Then they take these organizations and suddenly say, they're going to be out searching your car and searching your bags and asking you questions.
[01:12:23.664 --> 01:12:27.408]  And oh, we're going to boost the level of troops in Alabama from 5,000 to 15,000 of each.
[01:12:27.468 --> 01:12:32.052]  And oh, by the way, your neighborhood watch is going to be given gray uniforms.
[01:12:32.712 --> 01:12:33.893]  You see, this is how it works.
[01:12:37.083 --> 01:12:47.550]  He got photos of this and they're posted on the site and it is to tell us the whole story of what happened and what he witnessed is Bob Stevens from Pensacola, Florida.
[01:12:48.571 --> 01:12:49.892]  Bob, it's good to have you on with us.
[01:12:50.492 --> 01:12:51.833]  It's good to be on, Alex.
[01:12:52.594 --> 01:12:56.597]  I just wanted to cover what actually happened back in January when I went to the Senior Bowl.
[01:12:57.077 --> 01:13:05.263]  I went to the Senior Bowl with my son and figured, I was sure there would be some people at least searching at the gate for some caps or something like that.
[01:13:06.157 --> 01:13:06.679]  I don't know.
[01:13:11.698 --> 01:13:19.042]  A few of them had MP around their sleeve, so I went inside and found my seat and then I went back.
[01:13:19.242 --> 01:13:22.743]  Hey Bob, you don't have a radio on, do you?
[01:13:22.803 --> 01:13:26.345]  No, actually it's pretty loud here at where I'm working.
[01:13:26.445 --> 01:13:28.326]  Okay, well thanks for joining us.
[01:13:28.346 --> 01:13:29.607]  I just wanted to make sure that wasn't bad.
[01:13:29.907 --> 01:13:34.169]  Okay, so you go in, then you come back out, you take photos and you question them.
[01:13:34.209 --> 01:13:35.029]  Describe that for us.
[01:13:35.289 --> 01:13:38.791]  Yeah, well basically I started questioning and there was a woman there
[01:13:40.225 --> 01:13:44.287]  I started questioning her and her authority of her being there.
[01:13:44.687 --> 01:13:48.869]  She got really defensive with me and she started to make a scene actually.
[01:13:50.010 --> 01:13:58.015]  Then I talked to another gentleman who had an MP on his sleeve and I found out that it was her husband.
[01:13:58.335 --> 01:14:00.136]  They had a husband and wife team there.
[01:14:01.583 --> 01:14:13.471]  And I told her husband that I wanted to take pictures of him and he said that I couldn't take pictures of him and that he would have to get permission from his supervisor to see if I was allowed to take pictures.
[01:14:14.191 --> 01:14:19.015]  And I told him it was a free country and I'd take pictures wherever I wanted to take pictures and he couldn't do anything about it.
[01:14:19.835 --> 01:14:24.098]  But he decided he was going to talk to his supervisor and he did so.
[01:14:24.298 --> 01:14:26.400]  And his supervisor, I ended up talking with him.
[01:14:27.085 --> 01:14:31.989]  I mean, they're all pretty much, other than the woman, they're all pretty much nice people.
[01:14:32.529 --> 01:14:40.255]  They weren't mean or nasty or anything, but they think they're doing something good when in reality they're not really doing anything good.
[01:14:41.676 --> 01:14:47.921]  Well, I mean, they could easily have police searching people's bags, which is bad enough, but no, they want those uniforms.
[01:14:47.941 --> 01:14:50.043]  They want people to be conditioned to that.
[01:14:50.363 --> 01:14:51.684]  Yeah, it's all conditioning.
[01:14:51.744 --> 01:14:55.767]  I mean, at each of the gates where they had someone in camo,
[01:14:56.723 --> 01:15:04.065]  Um, looking through everyone's bags and purses, and of course they had a police officer at the gates as well, but he wasn't doing anything, he was just standing there.
[01:15:04.585 --> 01:15:09.966]  In case, they told me that he was there in case somebody needed to be arrested, the police officer would do the arresting.
[01:15:10.486 --> 01:15:13.727]  Um, but he didn't do anything, from what I saw, he just stood there, didn't lift a finger.
[01:15:13.747 --> 01:15:24.069]  By the way, we have video of things that went from training ops to real world, where Marines set up checkpoints, search cars, and when they find something, they step back and the cops come in, folks.
[01:15:25.315 --> 01:15:26.116]  This is incredible.
[01:15:28.037 --> 01:15:29.938]  Describe your confrontation with this woman.
[01:15:30.979 --> 01:15:37.303]  Basically, I was just telling her that legally the military can't be out on the streets.
[01:15:37.343 --> 01:15:39.704]  They can't be policing the general public.
[01:15:39.744 --> 01:15:41.125]  That's what the police are for.
[01:15:41.945 --> 01:15:45.528]  She just said that she was authorized by the state governor to do so.
[01:15:45.548 --> 01:15:47.729]  That's basically it.
[01:15:47.769 --> 01:15:49.550]  She just got really mean and nasty.
[01:15:51.647 --> 01:15:53.048]  Now, do you have a photo of her?
[01:15:53.568 --> 01:15:55.109]  No, actually, I didn't get one of her.
[01:15:55.129 --> 01:15:59.872]  Well, it looks like there's a shot of a woman from the back in camo who's searching people.
[01:15:59.952 --> 01:16:01.112]  Yeah, that was a different one.
[01:16:01.252 --> 01:16:02.853]  I got that one from up top.
[01:16:02.893 --> 01:16:05.835]  I didn't get close enough to get a close-up picture of that one.
[01:16:06.736 --> 01:16:10.678]  I'm sure I'm going to be going to the game this year with my camera again.
[01:16:10.758 --> 01:16:19.763]  Like I said in the email I sent you, I did talk to the sergeant of Mobile, Alabama after this event on Monday.
[01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:30.935]  And I asked him about it and how they can actually send people out on the streets in camo and that it's just conditioning the public to think that it's okay to have military on the streets.
[01:16:31.936 --> 01:16:38.859]  He said that it was a great idea and that he was going to do it again next year, that these people really helped him out.
[01:16:40.812 --> 01:16:45.075]  And right out in the open, top generals are saying we're getting rid of posse commentatus.
[01:16:45.135 --> 01:16:46.176]  It's a good thing.
[01:16:46.736 --> 01:16:48.837]  And all over the country we see this happening.
[01:16:48.877 --> 01:16:57.943]  But this particular group are... I mean, when you talk to the state government, we've got links to the government's website.
[01:16:58.424 --> 01:16:59.224]  They're in Alabama.
[01:17:01.995 --> 01:17:05.577]  Did they describe to you what some of the other operations are they're going to be carrying out?
[01:17:06.098 --> 01:17:08.380]  No, I have no idea what they do.
[01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:18.448]  I know that they're... I saw on their website they had some emergency training, some FEMA type stuff in case of an emergency.
[01:17:18.528 --> 01:17:22.932]  I mean, they're going to be activated to help the public, from what I gather.
[01:17:23.692 --> 01:17:26.735]  Yeah, to help take us to FEMA centers to be forcibly injected.
[01:17:26.975 --> 01:17:28.316]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:17:29.486 --> 01:17:31.988]  What were the crowds doing when they were witnessing all of this?
[01:17:32.628 --> 01:17:34.850]  That's not good either.
[01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:36.591]  Most people were just going through.
[01:17:36.771 --> 01:17:43.456]  I was the only one that did any questioning to them while I was there.
[01:17:44.017 --> 01:17:46.819]  What exactly were these troops doing?
[01:17:47.719 --> 01:17:53.924]  They were just at the gate looking through people's purses and bags, making sure nobody was bringing beer into the stadium.
[01:17:54.883 --> 01:17:55.943]  Um, and that's about it.
[01:17:56.424 --> 01:18:02.165]  Yeah, that's the job of troops, making sure there's not a flask of whiskey or something so we can arrest people.
[01:18:03.745 --> 01:18:05.466]  That is utterly ridiculous, Bob.
[01:18:05.926 --> 01:18:06.806]  Yep, I agree.
[01:18:09.467 --> 01:18:11.427]  Well, we're just going to see more and more of it.
[01:18:11.767 --> 01:18:15.948]  Look for these guys to be running checkpoints on your highway in the near future.
[01:18:15.968 --> 01:18:18.509]  We've already had this going on for a long time before 9-11.
[01:18:20.316 --> 01:18:27.706]  I've got people that I talk to that I bring up information and tell them this is going on and that's going on.
[01:18:27.746 --> 01:18:29.928]  Of course you've got the documents to back it up.
[01:18:29.969 --> 01:18:33.093]  People just refuse to believe what's going on around them.
[01:18:33.653 --> 01:18:34.715]  They don't realize that
[01:18:35.146 --> 01:18:41.955]  That when you're driving down the road, being pulled over for no reason, they think that that's okay because that's to keep the road secure.
[01:18:42.196 --> 01:18:49.746]  They think it's okay that if you're walking, going to a movie theater, that the police should be able to... And now, and now it's, hey, let us go ahead and search your house.
[01:18:49.766 --> 01:18:50.507]  What do you have to hide?
[01:18:50.547 --> 01:18:51.028]  Stay there, Bob.
[01:18:51.048 --> 01:18:51.629]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:54.048 --> 01:18:57.069]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:18:57.409 --> 01:19:06.212]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:19:06.532 --> 01:19:11.214]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:19:11.674 --> 01:19:18.417]  The Murky Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:19:18.797 --> 01:19:30.602]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:19:31.062 --> 01:19:35.524]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:19:52.893 --> 01:19:53.333]  Gold.
[01:19:53.694 --> 01:19:54.975]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:19:55.235 --> 01:20:01.320]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:05.323]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:20:05.683 --> 01:20:07.565]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:20:07.605 --> 01:20:09.926]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:20:10.047 --> 01:20:15.691]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency.
[01:20:15.711 --> 01:20:16.292]  We're good to go.
[01:20:31.067 --> 01:20:31.387]  It was crazy.
[01:20:58.274 --> 01:21:03.475]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:21:04.435 --> 01:21:08.516]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution.
[01:21:08.956 --> 01:21:17.638]  Your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[01:21:18.438 --> 01:21:23.739]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.

[01:22:23.595 --> 01:22:25.977]  America is in an energy crisis.
[01:22:26.317 --> 01:22:28.038]  OPEC hasn't kept up on supplies.
[01:22:28.358 --> 01:22:30.639]  Refineries haven't been able to keep up with demand.
[01:22:30.899 --> 01:22:32.840]  Demand from China has been insatiable.

[01:22:42.024 --> 01:22:42.584]  Mystery Solved!
[01:22:57.961 --> 01:22:59.862]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:23:00.342 --> 01:23:03.163]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:04.964 --> 01:23:10.505]  Alright, your calls are coming up in the next segment and a bunch of other news we haven't gotten to.
[01:23:12.106 --> 01:23:15.407]  But finishing up with our guest, we've got another guest coming up in the next hour.
[01:23:15.427 --> 01:23:18.408]  Finishing up with Bob Stevens, I appreciate coming on.
[01:23:19.269 --> 01:23:23.090]  Bob lives in Pensacola and was there in Alabama for the Senior Bowl.
[01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:52.265]  and got these weird retired military people now back in uniform with MP on their arm uh... I mean and their uniforms look like they're wearing you know just just bags or something I mean just sloppily dressed with cell phones hanging off their lapels and huge MP arm bracelets I mean it just that's fascism just citizen goons running around and they're gonna have that control freak neighborhood watch chief your
[01:23:54.085 --> 01:23:56.246]  You're a neighborhood association president.
[01:23:56.286 --> 01:23:57.566]  They're recruiting them all.
[01:23:57.907 --> 01:23:59.607]  They're going to wear gray uniforms.
[01:23:59.627 --> 01:24:01.968]  They're going to help search your car.
[01:24:02.008 --> 01:24:06.029]  And under the new national draft, millions of Americans will serve domestically.
[01:24:06.669 --> 01:24:10.070]  But the border will stay absolutely, totally wide open.
[01:24:10.090 --> 01:24:11.831]  And they'll take all your freedoms, don't worry.
[01:24:12.751 --> 01:24:14.471]  Bob, any other points you want to make about this?
[01:24:14.711 --> 01:24:16.352]  Yeah, one more thing I wanted to let you know.
[01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:21.273]  They weren't all ex-military, just to let the listeners know.
[01:24:21.753 --> 01:24:25.916]  I know the woman that I spoke with was never in the military whatsoever.
[01:24:26.076 --> 01:24:28.738]  So they aren't necessarily all just ex-military.
[01:24:28.798 --> 01:24:32.400]  They can be just normal people that have never served in the military.
[01:24:33.321 --> 01:24:39.865]  The National Guard website for Alabama says they just get citizens and put them in a uniform.
[01:24:39.905 --> 01:24:43.367]  It says MP, no training, and just shove them out on the street.
[01:24:43.387 --> 01:24:44.228]  Boy, this is great!
[01:24:45.007 --> 01:24:51.072]  And the one gentleman also told me that, because I asked him, I said, well, would someone like me be able to join your organization?
[01:24:51.112 --> 01:25:00.040]  And he said that anyone who is involved in any organization that has anything to do, that's anti-government whatsoever, you're not allowed to join our organization.
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:07.265]  And I asked him, being a John Birch member, if I would be allowed to join their organization, and he said I wouldn't be able to.
[01:25:08.206 --> 01:25:12.330]  So he's also a commissar, he's a, literally folks, he's a political
[01:25:12.990 --> 01:25:15.193]  That's correct there, Alex.
[01:25:15.253 --> 01:25:15.973]  Yeah, he said, no way.
[01:25:36.463 --> 01:25:42.846]  So you should have asked him, and oh, you've had special anti-government training to know how to spot the terrorists, right?
[01:25:42.986 --> 01:25:43.426]  Mm-hmm.
[01:25:44.126 --> 01:25:48.548]  Oh yeah, that guy's had plenty of FEMA briefings, FEMA brainwashing sessions.
[01:25:48.828 --> 01:25:50.468]  What else did this goonball say?
[01:25:50.608 --> 01:25:52.569]  Oh, that was about it.
[01:25:52.669 --> 01:26:04.894]  It happened back in January, like I said, so I don't know, I don't remember everything that we went through because I mean, I went back and forth with them and all I know, all I can remember, they weren't happy with me because when I started questioning what they were doing there,
[01:26:05.576 --> 01:26:08.517]  Uh, they were not happy about the whole situation.
[01:26:08.637 --> 01:26:12.118]  So basically, he considered you to be anti-government because you asked questions?
[01:26:12.278 --> 01:26:13.299]  Oh yeah, most definitely.
[01:26:13.359 --> 01:26:15.379]  Well again, asking questions is un-American, sir.
[01:26:15.399 --> 01:26:18.320]  You're not supposed to be, uh, you know, against troops.
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:22.382]  I mean, the Founding Fathers were against troops in the streets, but again, they're bad too, famous says.
[01:26:22.522 --> 01:26:23.242]  Yep, that's right.
[01:26:24.085 --> 01:26:26.586]  So you're in there with those wicked founding fathers now?
[01:26:27.366 --> 01:26:27.806]  Yeah.
[01:26:29.026 --> 01:26:29.366]  You know what?
[01:26:29.386 --> 01:26:38.129]  You should call the state and say, oh, I want to volunteer for this and go in and say, oh, by the way, I believe in the Constitution and I think this is questionable.
[01:26:38.169 --> 01:26:39.449]  They'll go, oh, sorry, you can't.
[01:26:39.549 --> 01:26:41.830]  And then you can sue their tails off.
[01:26:42.110 --> 01:26:46.091]  Yeah, I live in Florida, and it was in Alabama, so I thought of that myself.
[01:26:46.611 --> 01:26:49.232]  If I lived in the state, I would definitely look into that.
[01:26:49.692 --> 01:26:52.553]  Well, I want to try to get some of these people on the broadcast.
[01:26:53.573 --> 01:26:53.633]  OK.
[01:26:54.602 --> 01:27:18.705]  So I think I'll, and folks if you go to the website Infowars.com you can link through to the Alabama organization, the Alabama State Military Department that issued the Order 100-2 and this group that was originally support for families that issued these uniforms, anybody that wants them, who loves the government, loves tyranny, you can then link through to their website and give them a call and ask them about this.
[01:27:21.952 --> 01:27:22.792]  Anything else, Bob?
[01:27:41.272 --> 01:27:48.998]  And they don't completely agree with me up front, but then, you know, a couple months later they see something and it triggers something in their mind and then they start asking questions.
[01:27:49.178 --> 01:27:54.742]  Exactly, they see the video and then the troops pull them over and search their vehicle and they go, wow, this is really happening.
[01:27:54.962 --> 01:27:57.905]  Yeah, but the tapes are great and people need to get them.
[01:27:58.625 --> 01:28:02.408]  Alright, well Bob Stevens, thank you for the photos and the information and take care my friend.
[01:28:02.468 --> 01:28:03.509]  You too, Alex.
[01:28:03.849 --> 01:28:04.610]  Bye now.
[01:28:04.670 --> 01:28:05.330]  Boy, I tell you.
[01:28:07.418 --> 01:28:09.261]  And Tommy Franks on TV last night.
[01:28:09.301 --> 01:28:10.122]  General Tommy Franks.
[01:28:10.562 --> 01:28:14.248]  Well, it's sad to say when there's another attack we're going to have martial law.
[01:28:14.328 --> 01:28:15.690]  It's what the people want.
[01:28:16.250 --> 01:28:19.695]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[01:28:21.257 --> 01:28:22.259]  Just don't question it.
[01:28:23.855 --> 01:28:34.579]  And I have this article where Northcom's putting help-wanted ads for positions for, uh, disinformation officers to plant fake news stories in our media and lie to us.
[01:28:34.599 --> 01:28:38.881]  Just openly, job applicants wanted for the military to manipulate the minds of the American people.
[01:28:39.341 --> 01:28:42.263]  Help-wanted, help-wanted, black ski mask issued for free.
[01:28:43.583 --> 01:28:46.604]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.624 --> 01:28:50.186]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.231 --> 01:28:55.712]  Did you remember to take your Focus Factor this morning?
[01:28:56.112 --> 01:28:56.372]  No?

[01:29:27.385 --> 01:29:29.426]  You owe it to yourself to take good care of it.

[01:29:53.037 --> 01:29:58.261]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:29:58.401 --> 01:30:06.506]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:30:06.766 --> 01:30:13.811]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:30:13.991 --> 01:30:15.272]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:30:15.352 --> 01:30:21.257]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:30:21.438 --> 01:30:26.522]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:30:26.642 --> 01:30:35.510]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:30:35.790 --> 01:30:39.073]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:30:52.905 --> 01:30:53.925]  It's finally here.
[01:30:54.025 --> 01:30:55.046]  Spring has arrived.
[01:30:55.226 --> 01:30:58.187]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:30:58.387 --> 01:31:01.848]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:31:02.068 --> 01:31:10.231]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[01:31:10.491 --> 01:31:11.251]  With Ark's heirloom

[01:32:00.853 --> 01:32:03.717]  Alright, coming up, I'm going to get more into this Boston Globe article.
[01:32:03.737 --> 01:32:06.621]  Brain device offers hope for some mental disorders.
[01:32:07.102 --> 01:32:07.903]  Implantable chip.
[01:32:07.943 --> 01:32:09.305]  Everything will be okay once you have it.
[01:32:11.022 --> 01:32:13.804]  Also, more on Northcom, who we know listens.
[01:32:14.104 --> 01:32:17.547]  We're on there in Colorado Springs where they're based, on the local AM dial.
[01:32:18.228 --> 01:32:29.776]  Help wanted ads for PSYOP themes and messages for use overseas and domestically, as well as, quote, deception plans.
[01:32:30.257 --> 01:32:32.318]  That's what they call their little programs of lies.
[01:32:32.879 --> 01:32:34.040]  Lying and manipulating us.
[01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:37.162]  Source, terror attacks to begin early September.
[01:32:37.182 --> 01:32:39.504]  Of course, it turns out that information is four years old.
[01:32:40.304 --> 01:32:43.085]  We'll also get into that for you.
[01:32:43.105 --> 01:32:47.708]  And a bunch of other police state news, all part of the new freedom.
[01:32:48.628 --> 01:32:50.809]  But right now, let's go to the calls quickly.
[01:32:50.929 --> 01:32:51.849]  Ralph in Indiana.
[01:32:51.929 --> 01:32:52.770]  Ralph, you're on the air.
[01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:53.230]  Go ahead.
[01:32:53.610 --> 01:32:54.190]  Hi Alex.
[01:32:54.911 --> 01:32:58.372]  I'm hoping you could shed some light on something I heard on Fox News a few weeks ago.
[01:32:58.953 --> 01:32:59.273]  Okay.
[01:32:59.413 --> 01:33:03.255]  There was a so-called expert on there talking about all the lies in Michael Moore's film.
[01:33:03.275 --> 01:33:06.496]  The one that upset me a little bit, because it's been a basis for my arguments.
[01:33:07.536 --> 01:33:08.277]  Or one of the bases.
[01:33:09.235 --> 01:33:12.438]  He said that the UNICAL pipeline was abandoned.
[01:33:13.418 --> 01:33:36.677]  He said that's one of Michael Moore's, you know, he talked about an abandoned UNICAL pipeline and... Well, what happened is UNICAL with Mr. Karzai, who's a UNICAL executive, who's now the public president, had a pipeline deal that got abandoned before 9-11 because they couldn't get out some elements of the Taliban that weren't CIA controlled to go along with it.
[01:33:38.387 --> 01:33:39.451]  And so then...
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:42.461]  The UNICAL pipeline.
[01:33:42.982 --> 01:33:51.489]  A deal was signed with the IMF and World Bank with another oil company with UNICAL getting rights but under a different umbrella name to put the pipeline in.
[01:33:51.509 --> 01:33:54.811]  And that pipeline is being built as of two years ago.
[01:33:54.831 --> 01:33:55.572]  Okay.
[01:33:55.812 --> 01:33:56.873]  I figured it was something like that.
[01:33:56.893 --> 01:34:00.175]  Well, they also say that none of the Bin Ladens were ever flown out.
[01:34:00.276 --> 01:34:01.236]  That was all lies.
[01:34:01.276 --> 01:34:08.122]  And then they go, well, actually they were, but on September 18th, seven, eight days later,
[01:34:09.179 --> 01:34:11.680]  And that by then the FBI did question them and search them.
[01:34:12.060 --> 01:34:13.521]  Well, in a way that's true.
[01:34:14.741 --> 01:34:26.106]  On September 18th, there was a bin Laden half-brother and some other Saudis that did fly out of Orlando and they were searched by FBI.
[01:34:26.126 --> 01:34:27.286]  So it's sleight of hand.
[01:34:27.846 --> 01:34:36.910]  No, what the Judicial Watch document itself from the Customs Department and the government's own admissions
[01:34:38.877 --> 01:34:47.399]  And again, this was in Miami newspapers on the 13th and 14th of September back then, so it was already being reported on.
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:58.102]  So they tried to slide a hand to the 18th, but 160-plus flew out on three separate flights before that and were not searched, and the White House ordered their release.
[01:34:58.182 --> 01:35:00.443]  So, again, it's all sleight of hand.
[01:35:00.463 --> 01:35:01.403]  Sleight of hand, yeah.
[01:35:01.683 --> 01:35:02.424]  That's okay.
[01:35:02.484 --> 01:35:03.664]  Thanks for clarifying that.
[01:35:04.264 --> 01:35:04.804]  You bet, Ralph.
[01:35:05.064 --> 01:35:06.165]  Thank you very much.
[01:35:06.185 --> 01:35:06.805]  Thanks for the call.
[01:35:08.006 --> 01:35:09.888]  But again, what does Michael Moore do?
[01:35:12.009 --> 01:35:25.740]  Michael Moore tells you about, I'd say, 2% of 9-11, and he makes it look like it's all the Republicans, and John Kerry and the Democrats are going to save us, and boy, everything will be fine in the world, it's just Bush.
[01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:29.923]  And Bush just had prior knowledge, and maybe he let it happen, maybe he's just an idiot.
[01:35:30.003 --> 01:35:35.207]  Either way, he's totally wrong for the job, and totally inept.
[01:35:36.391 --> 01:35:38.412]  And so we can all go back to sleep and everything's fine.
[01:35:38.812 --> 01:35:45.476]  Whereas, in truth, all these presidents are just puppets and the shadow government that's now public is taking over.
[01:35:46.196 --> 01:35:51.439]  And so Moore gives you a small piece of the story and then gives you false solutions.
[01:35:51.499 --> 01:35:54.820]  I mean, his book, Dude, Where's My Country?, calls for a U.N.
[01:35:54.860 --> 01:35:55.941]  takeover of America.
[01:35:55.961 --> 01:35:58.302]  Because America's such a rogue state and bad.
[01:35:58.702 --> 01:36:04.405]  Well, in truth, it's Europe that owns America, using us as the bad cop, using us as the shill, the foil.
[01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:08.132]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Ohio.
[01:36:08.152 --> 01:36:08.712]  Tim, go ahead.
[01:36:08.732 --> 01:36:09.513]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:36:09.833 --> 01:36:10.654]  Welcome.
[01:36:10.774 --> 01:36:14.276]  One quickie about Michael Moore before I go on to what I want to tell you about.
[01:36:14.416 --> 01:36:18.379]  Isn't Carlisle Group owning half of the theaters where his movie's playing?
[01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:22.963]  Okay, Newsmax with a classic slide of hand again, disinfo piece.
[01:36:24.564 --> 01:36:26.085]  I mean, Newsmax will do stuff like
[01:36:28.073 --> 01:36:31.735]  This liberal came out with the movie Hidalgo, and he's a liberal.
[01:36:31.815 --> 01:36:33.377]  It's not doing well at the box office.
[01:36:33.397 --> 01:36:34.737]  It has nothing to do with being a liberal.
[01:36:34.838 --> 01:36:37.179]  It's about a horse race in Saudi Arabia.
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:41.782]  And then they go, but the conservative, Mel Gibson, is doing great.
[01:36:42.483 --> 01:36:46.485]  Again, they try to create a fake left-right fight over something that doesn't even exist.
[01:36:47.826 --> 01:36:49.888]  And, you know, with the Viggo Mortensen story.
[01:36:50.568 --> 01:36:52.049]  The same thing goes with this.
[01:36:52.930 --> 01:36:55.211]  One week after Fahrenheit 9-11 was released,
[01:36:56.582 --> 01:37:04.865]  The first movie chain, big on the East Coast and the Midwest, was bought by the Carlyle Group.
[01:37:05.545 --> 01:37:07.166]  What does that have to do with Michael Moore?
[01:37:07.206 --> 01:37:08.926]  And they go, oh look, he's a hypocrite!
[01:37:10.067 --> 01:37:11.947]  He's connected to the Carlyle Group.
[01:37:11.987 --> 01:37:16.449]  That's like if I sold Christmas treats.
[01:37:17.587 --> 01:37:34.966]  And a month after I sold them to the delivery trucks that put them in stores, a psychopath buys one of the Christmas trees and puts it in his house, and when police raid the house, they find a tag on the Christmas tree and say Alex Jones is connected to the serial killer.
[01:37:35.366 --> 01:37:36.848]  I mean, it has no connection!
[01:37:37.992 --> 01:37:40.454]  But people pick up on that and go, oh look, he's a hypocrite.
[01:37:40.714 --> 01:37:42.155]  Bush is involved with the Carlisle Group.
[01:37:44.157 --> 01:37:45.758]  But it's just a tertiary connection.
[01:37:46.038 --> 01:37:46.618]  But see?
[01:37:47.259 --> 01:37:49.080]  So is Michael Moore!
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:50.061]  Well, no.
[01:37:50.261 --> 01:37:56.325]  The Bushes are their chief consultants to the Saudi royal family, the House of Saad.
[01:37:57.666 --> 01:38:00.728]  They are also the chief advisors to the Carlisle Group.
[01:38:00.908 --> 01:38:01.649]  They are
[01:38:02.569 --> 01:38:05.071]  They vacationed with the Bin Ladens and the Royal Saudis.
[01:38:05.391 --> 01:38:24.647]  James Baker III of James Baker and Associates, former Secretary of State under Lord Bush I, under Bush 41, Lord Bush and his minions are the ones, are the law firm hired to block the 9-11 families suing the Saudis.
[01:38:24.967 --> 01:38:26.868]  So that's a real connection.
[01:38:27.409 --> 01:38:29.811]  But out of the hundreds of theater chains
[01:38:31.278 --> 01:38:36.522]  This one in the top 20, not one of the biggest, bought by the Carl Group after Moore's film comes out.
[01:38:36.562 --> 01:38:38.143]  By the way, they took it off some of the screens.
[01:38:38.203 --> 01:38:39.463]  I didn't mention that part.
[01:38:39.483 --> 01:38:40.244]  It was in another article.
[01:38:40.644 --> 01:38:43.086]  Somehow, that's Moore's connection.
[01:38:44.887 --> 01:38:45.327]  Interesting.
[01:38:45.607 --> 01:38:50.110]  So it's like you own a Ford car, so you secretly funded Hitler now.
[01:38:52.332 --> 01:38:54.133]  Because Henry Ford helped fund Hitler.
[01:38:54.593 --> 01:38:58.836]  Yesterday, I tried to get through and we were speaking about the law and the changes.
[01:38:59.412 --> 01:38:59.692]  Yes.
[01:38:59.892 --> 01:39:07.837]  You can actually go all the way back to like 1890 to document the start of the legal changes that were being perpetrated on this country.
[01:39:07.977 --> 01:39:14.721]  And I think a couple weeks ago I mentioned this one particular case, Erie v. Tompkins, 1938.
[01:39:15.061 --> 01:39:18.744]  I would encourage every freedom-loving individual to
[01:39:19.565 --> 01:39:23.167]  Dial that into a search engine and read on what comes up.
[01:39:23.408 --> 01:39:34.535]  It's all about the Common and Constitutional Law versus the UCC and how the American Bar Association is nothing more than a subsidiary of the Lawyers Guild of Great Britain.
[01:39:34.755 --> 01:39:40.139]  No, it's all true and they've created a parallel government where we have no freedoms, thanks for the call.
[01:39:41.179 --> 01:39:42.060]  Who's up next here?
[01:39:44.481 --> 01:39:46.683]  Maryland and California, you're on the air.
[01:39:47.614 --> 01:39:55.302]  Yes, hi Alex, I just wanted to tell you the latest here from the left coast on the disinformation thing they're doing.
[01:39:56.103 --> 01:40:06.213]  Both of our major papers, the San Francisco Chronicle and the Contra Costa Times had huge pictures of a guy in paramilitary outfit
[01:40:06.673 --> 01:40:07.713]  By the way, they do stuff like...
[01:40:28.303 --> 01:40:29.485]  Beating batons.
[01:40:30.407 --> 01:40:34.032]  When they don't have the batons and the shields, they stomp and bug their eyes out.
[01:40:34.072 --> 01:40:35.374]  We have photos and video of this.
[01:40:35.595 --> 01:40:36.176]  I mean, all of them.
[01:40:36.196 --> 01:40:38.940]  They'll just bug their... They'll even show their teeth at old ladies.
[01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:41.344]  They haven't told, get out there and stare them in.
[01:40:41.845 --> 01:40:43.127]  Let them know who the authority is.
[01:40:43.587 --> 01:40:53.172]  They also are now setting up special airport water zones right where they land over the bay on the Oakland Airport and the San Francisco Airport.
[01:40:53.192 --> 01:41:04.038]  They're called Maritime Security Zones and it says these are the latest... Now the new Maritime Administration is the one that's going to run the national ID card and again it's Admiralty Law.
[01:41:04.298 --> 01:41:08.981]  And also there's a big headline because it's a local writer says security measure won't stop threats
[01:41:09.281 --> 01:41:09.762]  I think so.
[01:41:24.462 --> 01:41:27.443]  They make majors at colleges or Homeland Security.
[01:41:27.923 --> 01:41:30.283]  The TV shows make them all the heroes.
[01:41:31.183 --> 01:41:31.923]  CSI.
[01:41:32.943 --> 01:41:41.965]  The whole economy is going to be shifted into cameras, prisons, checkpoints, toll roads, surveillance, and to have a job, you're going to have to go join this.
[01:41:42.045 --> 01:41:43.305]  That's how they're going to take control.
[01:41:43.805 --> 01:41:45.005]  I've got one question for you.
[01:41:45.125 --> 01:41:53.867]  I'm actually a low-level elected official in this area, and we have a policeman come in every month, and our next meeting is coming up.
[01:41:54.432 --> 01:41:59.875]  And I want to ask him, you know, you've been talking earlier about how the feds are taking over our police.
[01:42:00.315 --> 01:42:02.997]  I'd like to, can you suggest a question I could ask him?
[01:42:03.037 --> 01:42:04.238]  I'm not sure how to frame it.
[01:42:04.638 --> 01:42:09.661]  Just to, he may not answer it, he probably won't, just to put him on notice that I know.
[01:42:09.901 --> 01:42:15.924]  Well what the feds do is you say this, the feds come to say San Francisco and they go, here's 218 million dollars.
[01:42:18.748 --> 01:42:24.197]  And if you take this money, you have to sign a memorandum of agreement to follow our orders.
[01:42:25.032 --> 01:42:27.854]  In these certain areas, do you agree?
[01:42:27.974 --> 01:42:34.918]  Then they sign it, then they dispatch the officers to training seminars with the feds to learn how to be good little minions.
[01:42:35.738 --> 01:42:37.219]  And so they do this at every level.
[01:42:37.239 --> 01:42:43.102]  Then some cities like Detroit and New Orleans have publicly gone under total federal control.
[01:42:44.363 --> 01:42:46.864]  And so, I mean, I would just bring those points up to them.
[01:42:47.105 --> 01:42:49.906]  Well, I have seen very strange looking vehicles.
[01:42:49.946 --> 01:42:52.988]  We had a drug bus, our area out here in the
[01:42:53.547 --> 01:42:59.572]  Each of San Francisco is noted for many years for being under Hell's Angel Dominion with meth labs and all that.
[01:42:59.632 --> 01:43:04.456]  We had a big drug bust last year and I saw some of the strangest looking police vehicles.
[01:43:04.496 --> 01:43:05.537]  They were big black
[01:43:06.144 --> 01:43:33.426]  Black window Hummer vehicles and they were going a hundred miles an hour down a city street and I and that was the day of a drug bust and then this Saturday night a park vehicle we have a huge East Bay Regional Park District and they have these incredibly expensive SUVs now with three lights on and they were the park district was chasing a vehicle down a major street so I mean we're getting all kinds of police jurisdictions mixing it up and I'm certainly going to ask them about that.
[01:43:33.866 --> 01:43:37.088]  Well, I mean, that's what the multi-jurisdictional task forces did.
[01:43:37.408 --> 01:43:40.549]  They got the police used to working with county, state, federal, city.
[01:43:40.989 --> 01:43:50.094]  Now they're merging that, building regional command centers, and they put a CIA, NORTHCOM liaison officer in over them, and it's just horrible.
[01:43:50.134 --> 01:43:50.794]  Thanks for the call.
[01:43:52.795 --> 01:43:57.777]  The reason I'm asking who's up next is I was told a caller hung up, and I'd like to know who did hang up.
[01:43:59.618 --> 01:44:02.100]  Okay, let's go to Todd in California.
[01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:02.860]  Todd, go ahead.
[01:44:03.687 --> 01:44:05.689]  Oh yeah, I'm actually on fire, but that's no big deal.
[01:44:06.029 --> 01:44:06.850]  It's August 4th.
[01:44:07.090 --> 01:44:07.971]  I think you rock.
[01:44:08.491 --> 01:44:17.779]  I think that you actually have a great pointer, but the other point is that it's not about a cult of personality.
[01:44:18.660 --> 01:44:22.904]  If you do ultimately sell me out, I'm going to be prepared for that.
[01:44:23.404 --> 01:44:26.307]  Again, I have no idea what you're even talking about, Todd.
[01:44:27.082 --> 01:44:28.002]  No, no, no.
[01:44:28.323 --> 01:44:31.784]  A lot of what you're talking about is totally credible, totally legitimate.
[01:44:33.144 --> 01:44:34.525]  I think that Bush is going to win.
[01:44:34.825 --> 01:44:40.267]  Why would you destroy all of this momentum of the police state infomercial?
[01:44:40.307 --> 01:44:41.788]  Why would you destroy all of that?
[01:44:42.901 --> 01:44:45.863]  And why blow stuff up, really, if you don't have to?
[01:44:48.704 --> 01:44:50.726]  Wasn't it 1945, I guess?
[01:44:50.786 --> 01:45:05.814]  The Cold War began with the big mushroom cloud and the visual, and that led to 45 years of something, and now you have a visual that began on 9-11, and you don't necessarily need to blow other stuff up.
[01:45:06.374 --> 01:45:10.196]  You just live on the visual after a while, and you perpetuate that one.
[01:45:12.344 --> 01:45:30.937]  Well, what you're saying is that 9-11 is the big trigger event and the psychological pretext to now leave the Cold War and enter the new 100-year war on terror that is really against the individual, this smoky apparition that can never be defeated, this Goldstein-like Orwellian character.
[01:45:31.597 --> 01:45:43.750]  I'm just going off what the globalists are saying, and I believe that to get the real tyranny they want, they're going to need, from time to time, to apply new, real attacks, not just fake terror alerts.
[01:45:45.211 --> 01:45:54.581]  I mean, I hope and pray the globalists back off, and think they're getting enough gas mileage out of what they've done to get their police state so we can expose them and try to back them off.
[01:45:55.146 --> 01:46:03.312]  But I believe that in the next 365 days, you're going to see a big terror event either in Western Europe or the United States.
[01:46:04.116 --> 01:46:06.178]  No, I think that Bush obviously wins.
[01:46:06.218 --> 01:46:07.278]  This is an affirmation.
[01:46:07.339 --> 01:46:14.864]  If you just look at what Tom Ridge is, he's non-political, but he's an affirmation of this police state.
[01:46:15.324 --> 01:46:16.485]  He's not political?
[01:46:17.066 --> 01:46:18.707]  Why, because he says he's not political?
[01:46:19.147 --> 01:46:21.409]  No, no, but that's the way it's been presented.
[01:46:21.429 --> 01:46:23.450]  This is a Hollywood movie.
[01:46:23.551 --> 01:46:24.271]  It is.
[01:46:25.012 --> 01:46:30.636]  And that's what Tom Ridge is presented as, while non-political, and no one's going to vote against him.
[01:46:31.016 --> 01:46:32.116]  This isn't going to happen.
[01:46:32.136 --> 01:46:36.918]  He's going to be reaffirmed in any way, shape or form.
[01:46:37.498 --> 01:46:40.499]  But I don't think you need to blow stuff up to get what you want.
[01:46:40.519 --> 01:46:45.261]  You mean the globalists don't need to blow stuff up to get what they want?
[01:46:45.621 --> 01:46:45.861]  Right.
[01:46:46.321 --> 01:46:48.082]  It's already happening in the legislation.
[01:46:49.182 --> 01:46:51.483]  What you speak of each day, incrementally.
[01:46:51.803 --> 01:46:53.184]  Incrementalism is working.
[01:46:53.804 --> 01:46:56.605]  You don't necessarily need to have that big visual.
[01:46:56.865 --> 01:47:00.547]  And really, when you look at the Cold War, that worked for 45 years.
[01:47:00.787 --> 01:47:03.708]  It really worked from 45 to kind of 90.
[01:47:04.008 --> 01:47:05.989]  That was a 45 year type of thing.
[01:47:06.329 --> 01:47:09.730]  And now it's a little more... Sir, I appreciate your call, Todd.
[01:47:11.071 --> 01:47:12.531]  Calling from wherever you're calling from.
[01:47:13.352 --> 01:47:16.353]  Look, you're not listening to me.
[01:47:17.654 --> 01:47:22.336]  While we all thought we were safe during the Cold War, the Communists were killing tens of millions of people.
[01:47:23.057 --> 01:47:25.358]  And they were doing it under the support of this government.
[01:47:25.978 --> 01:47:31.781]  You notice they left McCarthy alone until he said, no, the Army runs the Communists, and I found out they're funding them.
[01:47:32.101 --> 01:47:45.308]  Well, in hindsight, they now have former CIA section chiefs on the History Channel, you know, at 92 years old, going, well, we actually thought that Mao was a stabilizing effect, so we actually put him in, contrary to popular belief.
[01:47:47.003 --> 01:47:49.985]  You know, so that's actually all true.
[01:47:50.525 --> 01:47:55.368]  So the globalists had their fun and brought total tyranny to half the world.
[01:47:55.928 --> 01:48:00.390]  Now under the new guise of the War on Terror, they're going to bring that here.
[01:48:01.150 --> 01:48:01.811]  You understand?
[01:48:01.971 --> 01:48:14.277]  It's about taking your property, taking everything you've got, having a draft, getting you into their system, totally controlling you, moving the police state out of the train stations and the conventions and the buses,
[01:48:15.314 --> 01:48:18.156]  Even off the highways into your homes, sir.
[01:48:18.676 --> 01:48:26.900]  They're not going to get their gun confiscation and their national draft and their compulsory service until they start vaporizing buildings.
[01:48:29.381 --> 01:48:30.882]  They're really gearing up for it.
[01:48:32.722 --> 01:48:35.804]  And so, just, just, just brace yourself.
[01:48:37.814 --> 01:48:38.574]  Ron in New York.
[01:48:38.634 --> 01:48:38.974]  Go ahead.
[01:48:38.994 --> 01:48:39.775]  You're on the air, Ron.
[01:48:40.135 --> 01:48:40.575]  Hi, Alex.
[01:48:41.215 --> 01:48:45.256]  I'm going to digress just for one moment from my original topic, and I'm going to get right back online.
[01:48:45.616 --> 01:48:48.317]  You had mentioned police officers banging their shields.
[01:48:48.337 --> 01:48:49.718]  Do you know where that technique comes from?
[01:48:51.178 --> 01:48:52.178]  Ancient Roman legions.
[01:48:52.198 --> 01:48:53.779]  The same people that crucified Christ.
[01:48:54.299 --> 01:48:55.740]  So people should keep that in mind.
[01:48:55.860 --> 01:48:56.300]  That's right.
[01:48:56.340 --> 01:48:57.181]  That's where that comes from.
[01:48:57.641 --> 01:49:02.603]  Okay, now my topic that I called about was a passage of a law about ten days ago with very little notice.
[01:49:03.064 --> 01:49:04.164]  You may be familiar with it.
[01:49:04.224 --> 01:49:06.485]  It was called the Law Enforcement Officer Safety Act.
[01:49:06.865 --> 01:49:07.186]  Yes.
[01:49:07.546 --> 01:49:07.846]  Okay.
[01:49:08.593 --> 01:49:09.454]  I read the law.
[01:49:09.654 --> 01:49:10.315]  It's basic.
[01:49:10.395 --> 01:49:11.936]  It sort of passed on the QT.
[01:49:11.976 --> 01:49:13.938]  In fact, it passed by a voice vote in the U.S.
[01:49:13.978 --> 01:49:15.039]  Senate, which is unusual.
[01:49:15.539 --> 01:49:16.840]  I've got to tell you the honest truth.
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:19.683]  Even as retired law enforcement, it's an embarrassment to me.
[01:49:20.303 --> 01:49:23.826]  And I could go on probably for an hour why it's an embarrassment to me.
[01:49:23.886 --> 01:49:27.889]  But simply, it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.
[01:49:27.929 --> 01:49:31.112]  Well, for those who don't know what it is, explain it.
[01:49:31.392 --> 01:49:33.874]  The special privileges if you're a former God.
[01:49:33.894 --> 01:49:33.975]  Sure.
[01:49:34.275 --> 01:49:35.856]  Could you hold me over?
[01:49:36.056 --> 01:49:36.296]  Yes.
[01:49:37.157 --> 01:49:39.078]  Because again, government is God.
[01:49:40.198 --> 01:49:44.699]  But how can we get people to go along with it in government if when they retire they'll no longer be God?
[01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:50.621]  They will continue to issue the Lord title, that's what Lordliness is, to them.
[01:49:51.422 --> 01:49:52.602]  Continual Lordship.
[01:49:53.297 --> 01:49:54.818]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:54.998 --> 01:49:58.081]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.221 --> 01:50:02.103]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.163 --> 01:50:06.386]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:06.747 --> 01:50:10.509]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:10.650 --> 01:50:12.451]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:12.731 --> 01:50:15.972]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[01:50:16.012 --> 01:50:20.693]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:20.873 --> 01:50:23.914]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.094 --> 01:50:26.975]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.435 --> 01:50:33.557]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.097 --> 01:50:37.882]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:52:53.591 --> 01:52:59.154]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:01.787 --> 01:53:05.411]  Alright, Ron is a retired New York police officer, we've talked to him before.
[01:53:06.132 --> 01:53:09.015]  Ron, explain to folks what you were just talking about.
[01:53:09.375 --> 01:53:17.244]  Yes, it's a law, it was signed into law very quietly, this was done probably around 10 or 11 days ago, called the Law Enforcement Officer Safety Act of 2004.
[01:53:18.445 --> 01:53:22.710]  The final analysis, what it does is it creates a national concealed carry.
[01:53:23.416 --> 01:53:26.797]  For officers who are both active and retired.
[01:53:27.237 --> 01:53:35.020]  So that, let's say for instance, an officer from New York, whether active or retired, could carry his gun in any one of the other 49 states of the Union.
[01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:38.621]  Or an officer from California can carry his gun in New York.
[01:53:39.282 --> 01:53:40.422]  Or a retired officer.
[01:53:40.842 --> 01:53:44.324]  Now, there are numerous things about this law that I'm ashamed of.
[01:53:44.504 --> 01:53:45.464]  Numerous points.
[01:53:45.964 --> 01:53:50.926]  The one in particular is this, and I gotta say that even though law would benefit me, what's right is right.
[01:53:51.531 --> 01:54:02.398]  How could you take somebody who's a retired officer, which is another word for private citizen, that's all you are once you retire, private citizen, elevate him to this right or privilege on a national basis?
[01:54:02.958 --> 01:54:06.801]  I'd see that as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.
[01:54:07.261 --> 01:54:09.803]  Well, they're actually issuing lordly title.
[01:54:10.481 --> 01:54:21.428]  Yeah, that's basically what they're doing is they're making, excuse my dog, they're making basically a privileged class who can carry a firearm throughout the 50 states.
[01:54:21.508 --> 01:54:22.889]  Wording of this law is disgraceful.
[01:54:22.909 --> 01:54:30.474]  But again, I said they would do this years ago because most police are pro-gun because they know when they retire they're going to lose that right.
[01:54:31.034 --> 01:54:35.858]  Now, suddenly, they're going to be happy because they're going to have special privilege.
[01:54:36.098 --> 01:54:36.298]  Right.
[01:54:36.338 --> 01:54:43.203]  Well, it will definitely drive a wedge between the retired officer community and the pro-gun community, and it was probably designed to do that.
[01:54:43.644 --> 01:54:46.486]  But if you see even the wording of this law, it's disgraceful.
[01:54:46.506 --> 01:54:49.328]  They talk about, with reference to active duty law enforcement,
[01:54:49.869 --> 01:54:54.196]  That they have the right to carry whether or not they're even properly trained in their agency.
[01:54:54.237 --> 01:54:58.504]  Could you imagine having some guy, let's say, I don't know, from New Jersey down there in Texas?
[01:54:58.985 --> 01:55:00.869]  Essentially, if he wants to, he could play comp.
[01:55:01.545 --> 01:55:02.185]  That's a disgrace!
[01:55:02.225 --> 01:55:02.766]  That's insane!
[01:55:03.206 --> 01:55:04.667]  That's a formula for catastrophe!
[01:55:05.067 --> 01:55:10.010]  And then you could have that same situation with someone who's nothing more than a private citizen, no better than you!
[01:55:10.450 --> 01:55:11.211]  Or anybody else!
[01:55:11.791 --> 01:55:14.973]  I don't see... This past... This was an NRA deal, by the way.
[01:55:15.753 --> 01:55:29.301]  They're the only ones right now who have the ear of the Justice Department and John Ashcroft, them and an adjunct organization called the Law Enforcement Alliance of America, which is basically an adjunct organization of the NRA.
[01:55:30.041 --> 01:55:35.405]  They're the only ones right now discussing with the Justice Department and John Ashcroft the specifics of implementation.
[01:55:35.905 --> 01:55:42.509]  This isn't even being opened up within the public realm where there could be... Well, how about we have nationwide Vermont concealed carry for everybody?
[01:55:42.990 --> 01:55:44.471]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[01:55:44.511 --> 01:55:48.894]  If you're going to have equal protection, it's you do it for everybody or you do it for none.
[01:55:49.034 --> 01:55:49.454]  Exactly.
[01:55:49.474 --> 01:55:50.735]  Thanks for the call, Ron.
[01:55:51.035 --> 01:55:51.796]  Great points.
[01:55:51.836 --> 01:55:54.377]  We've got to start in the third hour here in just a few minutes.
[01:55:54.738 --> 01:55:59.801]  We'll get to Ashley and everybody else in a bunch of news, and we have a guest coming up on the broadcast.
[01:56:01.402 --> 01:56:12.286]  Yeah, this is, I mean look, police have been pro-gun 93% of the time in major polls because they know guns make you safer and they don't want to lose their Second Amendment later.
[01:56:12.827 --> 01:56:17.889]  This is being done so they'll go along with gun control against the rest of us.
[01:56:17.929 --> 01:56:24.712]  They're being given special rights and again they call us the civilians, they're our new military authority.
[01:56:26.900 --> 01:56:32.060]  Before I end this second hour, I do want to encourage you to visit InfoWars.com.
[01:56:33.915 --> 01:56:44.757]  Or PrisonPlanet.com because I've got so many great videos I've made, so many wonderful films I carry, books on tape, other books by great researchers and authors.

[01:57:32.078 --> 01:57:32.718]  Stay with us.
[01:57:32.738 --> 01:57:33.138]  Big Brother.
[01:57:33.159 --> 01:57:34.059]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:34.540 --> 01:57:35.721]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.466 --> 01:57:55.307]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.047 --> 01:57:56.968]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.988 --> 01:58:01.571]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.791 --> 01:58:05.934]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.496 --> 01:58:15.301]  All right, my friends, now into hour number three of this Wednesday, the 4th of August, 2004 edition.
[01:58:17.702 --> 01:58:22.866]  We have the author of Bush Unplugged coming on, Truth and Neo-Consequences.
[01:58:24.816 --> 01:58:34.000]  And he's, well, what you'd call Bush's worst nightmare once working on the inside of the whole neocon situation.
[01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:39.462]  So we'll be talking to Mark coming up here in a few minutes and also taking your calls.
[01:58:40.323 --> 01:58:45.445]  A bunch of other police state impending terror attack alerts, fake alerts,
[01:58:47.279 --> 01:58:50.322]  Just a lot of key information we'll be covering in this third hour.
[01:58:50.342 --> 01:58:52.144]  That guest is coming up in a few minutes.
[01:58:52.584 --> 01:58:54.626]  Ashley in Idaho, you're on the air.
[01:58:54.646 --> 01:58:55.287]  Thanks for holding.
[01:58:55.627 --> 01:58:56.067]  Hi Alex.
[01:58:56.208 --> 01:59:00.331]  Do you know of any states that have not gone to the digital and barcode driver's license?
[01:59:01.593 --> 01:59:03.194]  I believe there's just two left now.
[01:59:03.254 --> 01:59:08.159]  It was 42, but now it's just a couple states that have not done that yet.
[01:59:08.945 --> 01:59:09.625]  Yeah, which one?
[01:59:10.226 --> 01:59:11.766]  I don't have the map in front of me.
[01:59:11.986 --> 01:59:13.787]  No, I saw it again a few weeks ago.
[01:59:13.807 --> 01:59:17.148]  I know Texas has had this since 1993, though.
[01:59:17.188 --> 01:59:18.929]  That's ten plus years.
[01:59:19.689 --> 01:59:33.234]  And one of the 9-11 whitewash commissions doesn't just want a domestic CIA to run our lives and spy on us, all crime considered terrorism, secret arrest forces, but they also want everything standardized for a national ID card.
[01:59:33.454 --> 01:59:34.495]  Well, we already have that.
[01:59:35.075 --> 01:59:37.636]  People don't remember that they thumb scan to get a license.
[01:59:37.656 --> 01:59:41.297]  They don't remember the digital photo, but all of that is biometric.
[01:59:43.098 --> 01:59:44.619]  How would I find out those two states?
[01:59:46.019 --> 01:59:57.363]  Well, you would... I don't have it in front of me, but 48 states have now put it in, and the other two are about to implement, and I don't have them in front of me.
[01:59:58.704 --> 01:59:59.084]  Okay.
[01:59:59.424 --> 02:00:00.325]  Alright, well thank you.
[02:00:00.825 --> 02:00:02.005]  Yes, thank you for the call.
[02:00:03.326 --> 02:00:03.606]  You can
[02:00:04.801 --> 02:00:08.905]  I don't know, do a search on states that don't have biometric identifiers.
[02:00:11.327 --> 02:00:13.970]  I would imagine that would find that for you.
[02:00:14.030 --> 02:00:18.814]  But almost all the states now have the biometric identifiers.
[02:00:19.935 --> 02:00:22.338]  Let's go ahead and talk to Russell in Florida.
[02:00:22.398 --> 02:00:23.739]  Russell, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:00:23.979 --> 02:00:25.380]  Alex, how are you doing today?
[02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:25.981]  Good, my friend.
[02:00:26.261 --> 02:00:29.064]  Welcome from Tips Land, east of Orlando, Florida.
[02:00:29.884 --> 02:00:31.365]  Well, we have that here in Austin, too.
[02:00:31.405 --> 02:00:32.526]  The exact same wordage.
[02:00:32.546 --> 02:00:33.847]  Do you not have a lot of furniture?
[02:00:33.867 --> 02:00:35.509]  A lot of young men living in a house alone?
[02:00:35.529 --> 02:00:39.412]  Are there any type of guns?
[02:00:40.012 --> 02:00:44.676]  If you're an exterminator or firefighter or phone person, go ahead and call the police on them.
[02:00:44.696 --> 02:00:45.717]  A SWAT team raid is needed.
[02:00:46.057 --> 02:00:46.317]  Right.
[02:00:46.618 --> 02:00:51.542]  You know, and speaking of Austin, I think you guys are ground zero for some type of attack, unfortunately.
[02:00:52.062 --> 02:00:52.803]  Why do you think that?
[02:00:52.863 --> 02:00:59.288]  Well, they'd love nothing more than to get rid of you and get rid of all the gun owners and all the people that you've been able to educate in your city.
[02:01:00.018 --> 02:01:01.759]  And it's scary.
[02:01:01.919 --> 02:01:15.125]  I'll tell you, I think, you had a caller before talking about a potential attack, and I think if they're going to attack anywhere, they're not going to attack the elite stronghold fortress in New York, all their money changers.
[02:01:15.145 --> 02:01:21.948]  They're going to attack probably the South, where the gun owners are, and eliminate a lot of the people that know their scheme.
[02:01:23.024 --> 02:01:26.646]  I know that basically they're trying to create Nazi Germany again with a high-tech overlay.
[02:01:26.966 --> 02:01:29.108]  Well, yeah, and I would agree with that.
[02:01:29.168 --> 02:01:34.191]  And also, the CFR so they can brag later and go, look at how smart we are.
[02:01:34.591 --> 02:01:37.593]  Gary Hart has said that the Midwest will be hit.
[02:01:38.177 --> 02:01:39.478]  And the White House told U.S.
[02:01:39.498 --> 02:01:44.519]  News & World Report coast-to-coast attacks with the Capitol being destroyed.
[02:01:44.539 --> 02:01:47.861]  I mean, the government's saying this will happen, but no specific threat.
[02:01:48.261 --> 02:01:48.501]  Right.
[02:01:48.761 --> 02:01:54.643]  Or they could also have another fake terror alert and then catch the terrorist in the act, see?
[02:01:54.683 --> 02:01:56.524]  And, oh, then be our saviors.
[02:01:57.024 --> 02:01:58.585]  That, I think, is in the cards, too.
[02:01:58.845 --> 02:02:02.106]  How about enraging all the so-called Christian neoconservatives?
[02:02:02.706 --> 02:02:08.571]  Even further, to basically give away their rights, accept the chip, give up their guns.
[02:02:08.751 --> 02:02:19.059]  I mean, you've already got so many so-called Christian conservatives brainwashed that, you know, to place an attack in their own backyard would further bring about their own scheme.
[02:02:19.619 --> 02:02:20.740]  It's scary, Alex.
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:21.621]  It really is.
[02:02:22.501 --> 02:02:23.602]  I've got a question for you, though.
[02:02:23.682 --> 02:02:24.443]  Okay, stay there.
[02:02:24.483 --> 02:02:28.386]  We'll let you finish up, and we'll go to our guest, the author of Bush Unplugged,
[02:02:29.156 --> 02:02:38.123]  And again, please visit our premiere websites InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:02:38.163 --> 02:02:38.783]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:38.803 --> 02:02:44.588]  Stay with us.
[02:02:45.068 --> 02:02:49.411]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:49.591 --> 02:02:54.055]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.175 --> 02:02:55.436]  There is a chance
[02:02:55.936 --> 02:02:58.538]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:58.558 --> 02:03:01.400]  The New World Order can emerge.
[02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:05.943]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.003 --> 02:03:12.948]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.048 --> 02:03:15.070]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:15.290 --> 02:03:25.836]  Homeland Security, Executive Orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.056 --> 02:03:31.359]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:03:32.039 --> 02:03:38.164]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order, or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:03:38.204 --> 02:03:39.885]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:40.186 --> 02:03:44.009]  Order today and spread the word!
[02:03:44.449 --> 02:03:47.872]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[02:03:48.172 --> 02:03:51.673]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:51.773 --> 02:03:55.714]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:03:55.934 --> 02:04:02.096]  Black murky replacement elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:02.496 --> 02:04:10.418]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:04:10.778 --> 02:04:11.219]  I think so.
[02:04:26.194 --> 02:04:29.396]  You get a 2-pack for only $91, or a 4-pack for only $173.
[02:04:29.557 --> 02:04:36.041]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:04:36.121 --> 02:04:37.422]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:04:43.775 --> 02:04:44.776]  It's finally here.
[02:04:44.896 --> 02:04:45.917]  Spring has arrived.
[02:04:46.077 --> 02:04:49.059]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:04:49.259 --> 02:04:52.702]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:04:52.722 --> 02:05:01.048]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[02:05:01.348 --> 02:05:05.072]  With Ark's Heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[02:05:05.292 --> 02:05:10.357]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[02:05:10.597 --> 02:05:15.101]  Ark's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[02:05:15.301 --> 02:05:19.365]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[02:05:19.445 --> 02:05:26.572]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce, and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[02:05:26.852 --> 02:05:27.392]  Big Brother.
[02:05:50.954 --> 02:05:51.975]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:52.716 --> 02:05:53.817]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.478 --> 02:05:55.299]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.060 --> 02:05:56.941]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:56.961 --> 02:06:01.285]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.806 --> 02:06:05.890]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.919 --> 02:06:13.341]  Alright, the author of Bush Unplugged, Mark Umile, is about to join us.
[02:06:13.401 --> 02:06:16.163]  Real quick, Russell, in Florida, finish up what you were saying.
[02:06:16.363 --> 02:06:19.944]  Well, I just wanted to say, your videos are bar none the best I've seen.
[02:06:20.084 --> 02:06:22.085]  I've seen Mike Rupert's Truth and Lies of 9-11.
[02:06:22.145 --> 02:06:30.289]  I've seen the two other independent videos on 9-11 that you sponsor on your website.
[02:06:30.449 --> 02:06:32.550]  And I think yours are bar none the best.
[02:06:32.950 --> 02:06:35.511]  My question is, 9-11 Road to Tyranny is so good,
[02:06:36.351 --> 02:06:46.075]  Are you planning on coming out with a new one with new evidence, say, of World Trade Center 7 and Silverstein coming out on that PBS documentary?
[02:06:46.235 --> 02:06:47.155]  It's all being done.
[02:06:47.255 --> 02:06:53.758]  The problem is, it's already two and a half hours long, the DVD almost three hours, 170 minutes long.
[02:06:54.718 --> 02:06:59.000]  And, you know, we need something that's not as long, I mean two hours maximum.
[02:06:59.833 --> 02:07:08.256]  And so, I've been playing with it, you know, trying to figure out... The problem is the evidence is encyclopedic of him carrying out the attacks.
[02:07:08.416 --> 02:07:10.316]  Oh, it's so expensive, it's crazy.
[02:07:10.336 --> 02:07:23.660]  You could, like you say all the time, you could spend a hundred days, probably, on all the evidence through your TV show, through your radio program, and through your documentaries, showing all the inconsistencies and all the lies.
[02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:26.341]  I've done daytime and nighttime shows in the past.
[02:07:26.741 --> 02:07:27.461]  I know, I've seen them.
[02:07:27.501 --> 02:07:28.482]  I don't have any idea.
[02:07:30.290 --> 02:07:31.331]  I don't know how you do it, Alex.
[02:07:31.351 --> 02:07:33.214]  I watched a lot of the stuff on PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:07:50.815 --> 02:07:53.718]  You've got so much good info, I wish I knew one quarter.
[02:07:53.798 --> 02:07:54.398]  And I know a lot.
[02:07:54.438 --> 02:07:57.761]  I just wish I knew one quarter of what you knew and your type of stuff.
[02:07:57.781 --> 02:07:58.962]  Well, I mean, I'm nothing special.
[02:07:59.002 --> 02:07:59.803]  This is my life.
[02:07:59.823 --> 02:08:01.385]  This is what I do 18 hours a day.
[02:08:01.925 --> 02:08:03.987]  Let's not exaggerate.
[02:08:04.007 --> 02:08:05.048]  16 hours a day usually.
[02:08:05.088 --> 02:08:05.568]  Some days 18.
[02:08:05.648 --> 02:08:07.930]  I've been doing that for a long time.
[02:08:07.950 --> 02:08:14.376]  And so if you totally live this, I mean, it's like if you're a football coach that all you think about is football, you get really good at football if you're smart.
[02:08:15.477 --> 02:08:23.704]  I'm like a professional football team coach or something when it comes to the New World Order, but all of you are coming along.
[02:08:23.764 --> 02:08:29.629]  Many of you are smarter than I am, and believe me, if you immerse yourself in this, you will get the big picture.
[02:08:29.649 --> 02:08:32.132]  Thanks for the compliments, and thanks for liking the show.
[02:08:32.152 --> 02:08:33.993]  The good news is people are waking up, Alex.
[02:08:34.434 --> 02:08:36.716]  People are waking up here, and they're waking up in Florida.
[02:08:37.304 --> 02:08:39.106]  Thanks to you and your tools, it's happening.
[02:08:39.707 --> 02:08:41.128]  You're a modern-day Patrick Henry.
[02:08:41.789 --> 02:08:45.654]  I thank God every day that there are people out there like you that are trying to fight the New World Order.
[02:08:46.234 --> 02:08:47.055]  Thank you, my friend.
[02:08:47.496 --> 02:08:48.317]  I appreciate that.
[02:08:49.117 --> 02:08:51.020]  Let's go to Mark Umile.
[02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:52.081]  I appreciate you joining us.
[02:08:52.101 --> 02:08:53.482]  The book, Bush Unplugged.
[02:08:56.081 --> 02:08:57.222]  Mark, good to have you on with us.
[02:08:57.482 --> 02:09:06.568]  Hey Alex, it's great to be here and I too appreciate all the great work that you're doing to get valuable information out to the public in a way that people can understand and digest.
[02:09:06.708 --> 02:09:08.749]  That's what we're trying to do with Bush Unplugged as well.
[02:09:08.889 --> 02:09:20.477]  Well, I appreciate what you're doing, my friend, but for those that don't know who you are and kind of your bio and what your book's about in a nutshell, tell us and then we'll kind of give us an overview and then let's dive into it.
[02:09:21.037 --> 02:09:23.778]  Well, I'm a writer and a researcher and a documentary filmmaker.
[02:09:24.498 --> 02:09:29.620]  Over the years, I've worked on all sorts of investigations behind the scenes for public and private interests.
[02:09:30.260 --> 02:09:36.102]  The thing that's pertinent to Bush unplugged, I worked in the R&D end of documentary TV.
[02:09:36.562 --> 02:09:43.765]  And throughout the 90s, I worked on a couple of projects that had to do with Saddam Hussein's Iraq, and even the rise of Al Qaeda.
[02:09:44.444 --> 02:09:58.696]  And also, I also did a piece on hydrogen fuel cells, and from that I was looking into the darker side of our energy future, and that's when I stumbled upon George W. Bush as Governor of Texas, and his disastrous environmental policies there.
[02:09:59.136 --> 02:10:02.539]  So in the wake of 9-11, I thought that I was in a really unique position.
[02:10:03.179 --> 02:10:24.979]  To tell a story to the American people about George Bush, about his big energy cronies, how he got here, who brought him to power, and to talk about all the information that was available to average citizens about Saddam's Iraq that would have led anybody to conclude that this whole war on terror has just been a complete manipulation.
[02:10:25.379 --> 02:10:26.220]  Thank you for having me.
[02:10:40.276 --> 02:10:40.476]  You know,
[02:11:10.896 --> 02:11:12.457]  Just the first paragraph of your bio.
[02:11:12.858 --> 02:11:17.501]  Mark Umile, the author of Bush Unplugged, is George Bush's worst living nightmare.
[02:11:17.921 --> 02:11:30.749]  He's a gun-toting, NRA-belonging, Bambi-killing, former Republican-supporting, middle-class, hunky, white American male who has strip-searched Mr. Bush's history in the light of real Christian American values.
[02:11:30.809 --> 02:11:32.050]  He writes a hard-knuckled,
[02:11:32.967 --> 02:11:41.005]  Knockout book exposing the true character of George W. Bush and the deeply rooted anti-American insanity of the neo-conservative agenda.
[02:11:41.025 --> 02:11:42.929]  Now, let me put it in a nutshell.
[02:11:44.375 --> 02:12:02.882]  This is the most vicious, wicked, organized criminal syndicate openly trying to set up martial law, Soviet Nazi dictatorship, with secret arrests, secret executions, hell on earth, end of America, never coming back, slaughter of all freedom, ultimate evil.
[02:12:03.062 --> 02:12:05.203]  Now, folks, I'm not exaggerating when I say that.
[02:12:05.963 --> 02:12:06.784]  Your comments to that?
[02:12:07.244 --> 02:12:10.307]  Well, I guess I'm really taking the light-handed approach then, aren't I, Alex?
[02:12:11.928 --> 02:12:13.890]  But, listen, there's no question about it.
[02:12:13.970 --> 02:12:22.437]  That's what I'm really trying to get across to the independent thinking centrists and the normal conservatives that we've known of, the non-neoconservatives.
[02:12:22.758 --> 02:12:25.160]  There's a drastic difference between what we thought of
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:36.208]  As traditional conservatives and these neoconservatives, and I'm sure you talk about it all the time, but what's happening in America is this country has gone through this radical right shift and people don't even realize it's happening.
[02:12:36.488 --> 02:12:53.822]  I think one of the most dangerous things that could happen if George Bush is re-elected is that he's going to have the opportunity to stack the Supreme Court with two or three more justices that are right-leaning and pack and stack the federal bench with these right-wing crackpots who will fall in lockstep with this administration's agenda.
[02:12:56.826 --> 02:13:04.578]  Well, Mark, I've had a chance to read part of your book, and I think it's got a lot of really good information, and I want to go over the corruption, but then we're going to get into this whole debate.
[02:13:05.536 --> 02:13:10.598]  Bush's cousin, his skull-and-bones pod-mate, coffin-mate, long-devil Kerry.
[02:13:11.058 --> 02:13:19.101]  And the fact that Kerry actually is for the open borders, the war, the UNESCO deals, campaign finance, really is just a clone.
[02:13:19.661 --> 02:13:21.001]  And we've never seen this before.
[02:13:21.061 --> 02:13:25.083]  Two people from the same 15-member elite society who are related.
[02:13:25.103 --> 02:13:27.684]  You know, we're all brought up, you could be president, young man, young lady.
[02:13:27.984 --> 02:13:29.824]  But in truth, this shows what a fraud it is.
[02:13:31.625 --> 02:13:38.471]  I think that Bush is an expression of how far down this corruption we've gotten that, you know, things have now come to this point.
[02:13:39.412 --> 02:13:42.695]  But, you know, you talk about conservative judges.
[02:13:42.715 --> 02:13:48.420]  They've got seven of the nine, and they're ruling that they can take your property with no just compensation.
[02:13:49.041 --> 02:13:50.662]  They're ruling against the Second Amendment.
[02:13:50.682 --> 02:13:52.443]  They're ruling against Judge Roy Moore.
[02:13:52.724 --> 02:13:55.286]  Bush promoted the Attorney General that went after Moore.
[02:13:55.726 --> 02:13:58.489]  I mean, so really, I think it goes way past left-right.
[02:13:59.069 --> 02:14:00.070]  Oh, there's no question about it.
[02:14:00.130 --> 02:14:04.813]  I mean, we really have to stop talking about the argument in terms of left versus right.
[02:14:05.073 --> 02:14:06.874]  And that's what I do on Bush Unplugged, Alex.
[02:14:07.234 --> 02:14:09.555]  I'm talking about a language that we can all understand.
[02:14:09.575 --> 02:14:14.778]  Well, let's go back to the history of George Bush, the Saudis, you know, the James Bakers, all of these people.
[02:14:15.059 --> 02:14:15.979]  Who are we dealing with?
[02:14:16.219 --> 02:14:17.360]  Who are the major players?
[02:14:17.580 --> 02:14:18.761]  Who holds the strings?
[02:14:20.213 --> 02:14:22.995]  In terms of the Bush-Saudi-Bin Laden connection?
[02:14:23.255 --> 02:14:27.898]  Lord Bush, just the whole, the ruling cabal, who are the neocons, what's their goals?
[02:14:28.658 --> 02:14:33.441]  Okay, well I think it's a good idea just to outline the neoconservatives and what they believe in.
[02:14:33.461 --> 02:14:34.882]  Listen, they believe the U.S.
[02:14:34.902 --> 02:14:38.184]  should move militarily and aggressively around the world.
[02:14:38.644 --> 02:14:44.648]  Using superior military force to maintain our status as the world's sole superpower.
[02:14:44.988 --> 02:14:53.032]  Now, if you look at the people who are behind them, big energy, big defense, this agenda is just tailor-made for the defense and energy industries.
[02:14:53.353 --> 02:14:55.854]  And you look at a great blueprint for that is Iraq.
[02:14:55.874 --> 02:14:57.215]  I mean, who stands to profit?
[02:14:57.995 --> 02:14:59.717]  In Iraq more than anybody else.
[02:14:59.997 --> 02:15:01.979]  You bomb the hell out of a place, right?
[02:15:02.239 --> 02:15:05.482]  And then we have to replenish all these bombs from all the bomb makers.
[02:15:05.762 --> 02:15:10.966]  And then you put in your cronies like Bechtel and Albert to rebuild the place.
[02:15:11.547 --> 02:15:14.209]  And it's just a real cash cow.
[02:15:14.249 --> 02:15:20.534]  And if you've got it, if you can get that oil flowing, you know, the Exxon Mobil, the Chevron Texacos, the BP's, they stand to make billions.
[02:15:20.914 --> 02:15:22.315]  People really don't get it, Alex.
[02:15:22.335 --> 02:15:24.117]  We don't have to go over there and own this oil.
[02:15:24.157 --> 02:15:25.078]  We just have to control it.
[02:15:25.338 --> 02:15:39.410]  Now, if you go back into Bush's past, and you look at, you know, George Bush Sr., James Baker, I mean, they've been working in concert with the Saudis and, you know, the big oil tycoons.
[02:15:40.070 --> 02:15:52.915]  The Carlisle Group, everybody who stands to profit from a war in Iraq and from using Iraq as a springboard to go further and deeper into the Middle East and to establish a greater control.
[02:15:53.035 --> 02:15:54.255]  So, I mean, all the players are there.
[02:15:54.295 --> 02:15:55.956]  I line them all up in Bush Unplugged.
[02:15:56.516 --> 02:16:01.398]  And, again, in a way that average Americans can easily access and understand.
[02:16:03.180 --> 02:16:04.841]  But look at the domestic agenda.
[02:16:04.961 --> 02:16:13.806]  A total, complete police state, an expanded domestic CIA, with no oversight by Congress, literally ruling our lives?
[02:16:14.907 --> 02:16:15.107]  Sure.
[02:16:17.084 --> 02:16:20.507]  Can I get back to something the other caller said right before?
[02:16:20.527 --> 02:16:26.451]  He said something really important about the police state and about people being brainwashed.
[02:16:26.471 --> 02:16:27.432]  This is what we have to do.
[02:16:27.472 --> 02:16:29.133]  We have to break through this brainwashing.
[02:16:29.453 --> 02:16:32.015]  We have to get people to start tuning in to Alex Jones.
[02:16:32.035 --> 02:16:34.857]  We have to give them the tools to do that.
[02:16:34.997 --> 02:16:36.979]  That's one of the things that my book does.
[02:16:37.059 --> 02:16:41.202]  Bush was making a speech the other day in Ohio, right after Kerry got his coronation.
[02:16:41.962 --> 02:16:49.225]  And he was going on about different things that they were doing in the war on terror, and they had their normal applause lines, and everybody was falling into lockstep.
[02:16:49.245 --> 02:16:50.985]  There was about a thousand Ohioans in the crowd.
[02:16:51.285 --> 02:16:53.826]  And at one point he mentioned something about the Patriot Act.
[02:16:53.866 --> 02:16:56.507]  You know, we put the Patriot Act in there because it's a great way to fight.
[02:16:56.887 --> 02:16:59.648]  And people... I mean, they were cheering.
[02:16:59.708 --> 02:17:00.148]  Here they are.
[02:17:01.889 --> 02:17:05.670]  They're cheering that they've lost, that they're losing their rights.
[02:17:05.690 --> 02:17:07.371]  And look, history clearly shows, Alex,
[02:17:08.576 --> 02:17:11.698]  Loss of civil liberties has a snowball effect.
[02:17:12.118 --> 02:17:15.460]  You know, you take away one, and that creates an erosion of liberties.
[02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:17.200]  And we saw that in Nazi Germany.
[02:17:17.300 --> 02:17:24.984]  Also, though, with these so-called public rallies, they make them sign a pledge that they support the president, that they're not going to criticize.
[02:17:25.365 --> 02:17:27.906]  They have to give their driver's license number and background.
[02:17:28.226 --> 02:17:29.747]  These are not public rallies.
[02:17:31.593 --> 02:17:34.115]  Did you see that where they have to do all that to get into the meetings?
[02:17:34.276 --> 02:17:37.539]  Well, it's very typical of the Republican Party.
[02:17:37.599 --> 02:17:43.324]  Listen, this is a party that has a numeric rating system for their own members of Senate.
[02:17:43.344 --> 02:17:44.245]  Stay there, we'll be right back.
[02:17:45.248 --> 02:17:49.969]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[02:17:50.190 --> 02:17:53.631]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[02:17:53.851 --> 02:17:56.311]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[02:17:56.551 --> 02:18:05.134]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[02:18:05.514 --> 02:18:11.276]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[02:18:11.556 --> 02:18:13.518]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[02:18:13.758 --> 02:18:20.684]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.
[02:18:21.024 --> 02:18:27.490]  Midas Resources is pleased to offer a subscription to the International Forecaster newsletter free of charge with a qualifying order.

[02:18:45.549 --> 02:18:47.170]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:18:47.310 --> 02:18:51.392]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:18:51.552 --> 02:18:54.433]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:18:54.513 --> 02:19:01.236]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:19:01.416 --> 02:19:04.417]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:19:04.617 --> 02:19:07.018]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:19:07.138 --> 02:19:15.022]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[02:19:15.282 --> 02:19:26.608]  Methazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.
[02:19:26.748 --> 02:19:33.152]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Murky Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:19:48.243 --> 02:19:55.649]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[02:19:56.730 --> 02:20:06.418]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[02:20:07.319 --> 02:20:13.904]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.

[02:20:44.979 --> 02:20:47.340]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:20:47.581 --> 02:20:51.423]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:20:51.743 --> 02:20:52.563]  Read the labels.
[02:20:52.983 --> 02:20:57.106]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:20:57.346 --> 02:21:01.528]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:21:01.908 --> 02:21:06.771]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:21:07.151 --> 02:21:10.754]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.

[02:21:16.538 --> 02:21:19.280]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.

[02:21:34.751 --> 02:21:38.773]  We'll take your calls for the offer of Bush Unplugged coming up in the next segment at 800-259-9231.
[02:21:59.711 --> 02:22:01.055]  That's 800-259-9231.
[02:22:01.075 --> 02:22:07.372]  You were talking about a writing system that they have for members of Congress, the Republican Party.
[02:22:07.472 --> 02:22:08.114]  Please continue.
[02:22:12.317 --> 02:22:14.539]  Republican senators, congressmen, they're rated.
[02:22:14.859 --> 02:22:18.742]  They're rated A, B, C, D, E, F, G, whatever it is.
[02:22:19.202 --> 02:22:26.148]  If they don't fall in lockstep with the administration's line or with the Republican leadership's line, they get rated.
[02:22:26.188 --> 02:22:29.070]  And that's how they keep them all marching in line.
[02:22:29.250 --> 02:22:39.738]  Well, this is Tom Tancredo has been exposing the open borders, the congressman from Colorado, and Bush has said that they're targeting him to try to defeat him for his re-election.
[02:22:40.717 --> 02:22:41.397]  Well, sure.
[02:22:41.457 --> 02:22:48.320]  Whoever gets out of line, that's the person that gets put on the back burner, or they do target them, or they don't get the funding.
[02:22:48.340 --> 02:22:49.881]  Well, remember Senator Bob Smith?
[02:22:49.901 --> 02:22:53.062]  He's got a really conservative voting record, and they went after him?
[02:22:53.802 --> 02:22:56.203]  Well, he must have fell out of line on some critical issue.
[02:22:56.263 --> 02:22:57.324]  I don't know what it is.
[02:22:57.344 --> 02:22:58.544]  There was several.
[02:22:58.964 --> 02:23:00.545]  Now, also,
[02:23:01.613 --> 02:23:05.836]  There's these Capitol Hill Blue articles, and I've gotten them pretty accurate in the past when they were covering Clinton.
[02:23:06.316 --> 02:23:13.081]  They say Bush is on Prozac, totally drugged out, throwing fits, cussing at people, and now we've gotten this from other sources.
[02:23:13.101 --> 02:23:13.921]  What have you heard about that?
[02:23:13.941 --> 02:23:16.163]  Well, I read that Capitol Hill Blue article.
[02:23:16.423 --> 02:23:17.103]  I don't know if...
[02:23:18.604 --> 02:23:32.108]  We can only speculate as to how accurate it is, but as somebody who's done a lot of research into Bush's background, I know that he does not have the psychological capabilities to deal with what he's dealing with.
[02:23:32.408 --> 02:23:35.889]  This is a man who's been propped up by wealthy elites.
[02:23:36.289 --> 02:23:37.870]  He's been shrouded in secrecy.
[02:23:37.930 --> 02:23:39.730]  He's been wrapped in industrial armor.
[02:23:40.030 --> 02:23:42.471]  He's got armies of media hens.
[02:23:42.871 --> 02:23:43.952]  What about Dick Cheney?
[02:23:44.332 --> 02:23:46.814]  I mean, he's running around cussing at people on the Senate floor.
[02:24:10.626 --> 02:24:15.833]  Well, Dick Cheney has never really been a person who has a firm grasp of reality.
[02:24:16.194 --> 02:24:17.535]  He's a rabid ideologue.
[02:24:17.575 --> 02:24:22.682]  He's someone who lives in his own mind and with his own agenda.
[02:24:22.963 --> 02:24:26.868]  And in Bush Unplugged, you know, I go into real detailed accounting.
[02:24:27.268 --> 02:24:37.418]  Of how Cheney orchestrated this whole weapons of mass destruction ruse and now that it's all been laid to waste by several of our own committees.
[02:24:37.518 --> 02:24:41.142]  He still says we found him and we're going to find him and it's just incredible.
[02:24:41.342 --> 02:24:47.127]  And he still says we have ties to Osama, Iraq had ties to Osama bin Laden and we're still developing those things.
[02:24:47.468 --> 02:24:51.672]  So this is not a guy who's really in touch with reality or he's just a flat out liar.
[02:24:52.032 --> 02:24:53.153]  That is an outright liar.
[02:24:53.194 --> 02:25:02.985]  That's the scary thing here, though, Mark, is these guys in their ivory towers have lost touch with reality, and now top generals are talking about martial law and suspending elections.
[02:25:03.665 --> 02:25:07.690]  I mean, this is like an Orwellian Twilight Zone episode.
[02:25:07.950 --> 02:25:09.751]  Oh yeah, we're definitely living in a version of 1984.
[02:25:09.871 --> 02:25:16.676]  And I'll tell you something else, and this is what I say to all my libertarian friends who don't see a difference between Kerry and Bush.
[02:25:16.956 --> 02:25:18.477]  Look, let's face it, Alex.
[02:25:18.577 --> 02:25:20.819]  Bush is the quintessential figurehead.
[02:25:20.859 --> 02:25:22.740]  He is the pretender to the throne.
[02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:23.881]  He's the ultimate puppet.
[02:25:24.461 --> 02:25:26.302]  And, you know, look, Dick Cheney is really the guy.
[02:25:26.342 --> 02:25:33.147]  I talk to people all over the country, a lot of conservative radio hosts, and off-air, they all tell me, look, we know that Dick Cheney's really running the show.
[02:25:33.467 --> 02:25:35.868]  Everybody in the conservative intelligence, you know that.
[02:25:36.209 --> 02:25:38.970]  So, you know, what I tell people is, look, I mean, look at Dick Cheney.
[02:25:39.311 --> 02:25:46.295]  I tell people, you know, a vote for Ralph Nader is actually a vote for George Bush, and a vote for George Bush is a vote for Dick Cheney.
[02:25:46.315 --> 02:25:47.896]  So maybe you should think of it in those terms.
[02:25:48.176 --> 02:25:50.117]  Yeah, but you didn't, I mean, you bring this up.
[02:25:52.310 --> 02:26:01.536]  Where is there a different policy, except maybe on abortion, and that's just rhetoric, by Kerry, Bush's cousin, his skull and bones pod mate?
[02:26:02.157 --> 02:26:03.657]  Well, are they really cousins, Alex?
[02:26:04.018 --> 02:26:04.578]  Oh, yes.
[02:26:04.718 --> 02:26:06.659]  Are they really blood cousins?
[02:26:06.679 --> 02:26:09.821]  No, they're cousins on four sides of the family.
[02:26:09.841 --> 02:26:10.842]  I only see two sides.
[02:26:11.302 --> 02:26:14.384]  Both sides, both male and female parents.
[02:26:15.825 --> 02:26:18.147]  Yes, four different ways they're cousins.
[02:26:18.567 --> 02:26:23.230]  Well, I think we should frame it in terms of a Republican versus a Democratic agenda.
[02:26:23.250 --> 02:26:25.131]  Now look, I'm no big supporter of the Democrats.
[02:26:25.451 --> 02:26:27.252]  I've never voted for a Democrat in my life.
[02:26:27.573 --> 02:26:30.014]  However, I will vote for Kerry in this election.
[02:26:30.374 --> 02:26:47.565]  One of the issues that I'm really, really concerned about, it's been completely under-reported in the press, is Bush's environmental record, where he has really, literally allowed his big energy buddies in oil, gas, coal, electric utility, the agricultural industry, timber and mining,
[02:26:48.125 --> 02:26:54.787]  To come in, nuclear, to come in and turn back a hundred years of environmental progress that dates back... Well, let's be clear on that.
[02:26:54.847 --> 02:26:57.167]  He's double funding all the land grabbing.
[02:26:57.648 --> 02:26:58.408]  That's right.
[02:26:58.628 --> 02:26:59.708]  That has increased.
[02:27:00.228 --> 02:27:04.909]  But then, dumping toxic waste in a lake, those controls have been taken off.
[02:27:04.949 --> 02:27:07.670]  So real environmental stuff has been turned back.
[02:27:07.830 --> 02:27:09.971]  All the land grabbing stuff has been accelerated.
[02:27:10.411 --> 02:27:12.431]  Right, and also they're allowing more mercury.
[02:27:12.491 --> 02:27:15.212]  His big agenda on saving our energy...
[02:27:15.812 --> 02:27:19.715]  His big energy solution is to burn more coal.
[02:27:19.735 --> 02:27:21.136]  The nastiest stuff in the world.
[02:27:21.196 --> 02:27:23.797]  I mean, this is what puts more mercury in our streams than lakes.
[02:27:24.137 --> 02:27:26.019]  This is what puts greenhouse gas in the air.
[02:27:26.279 --> 02:27:29.321]  They've completely ignored all the science on global warming.
[02:27:29.341 --> 02:27:30.261]  All right, we'll stay there.
[02:27:30.321 --> 02:27:32.143]  We'll take calls when we get back.
[02:27:32.523 --> 02:27:34.204]  Stay with us.
[02:27:35.465 --> 02:27:36.405]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.865 --> 02:27:38.487]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.387 --> 02:27:42.069]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.140 --> 02:27:46.141]  Did you know you've been cheated?
[02:27:46.361 --> 02:27:48.682]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[02:27:48.782 --> 02:27:49.482]  You heard that right.
[02:27:49.562 --> 02:27:52.064]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[02:27:52.204 --> 02:27:53.144]  You don't have to pay them off.
[02:27:53.384 --> 02:27:54.705]  The banks are defrauding you.
[02:27:54.945 --> 02:27:56.506]  Now is the time to fight back.
[02:27:56.726 --> 02:27:59.487]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.
[02:27:59.667 --> 02:28:03.369]  The procedure is easy and everything is done legally and within the law.
[02:28:03.589 --> 02:28:04.970]  Almost no one has ever failed.
[02:28:05.150 --> 02:28:06.051]  Check out 1-2-3 Nodet.com
[02:28:08.732 --> 02:28:11.974]  You can also waive out your mortgage debt and get a free and clear title.
[02:28:12.215 --> 02:28:14.996]  Mortgage Elimination is usually completed in two or three months.
[02:28:15.257 --> 02:28:17.959]  It's done by an outside source found on our website.
[02:28:18.019 --> 02:28:22.462]  Believe it or not, Mortgage Debt Elimination has been done for thousands for more than ten years.
[02:28:22.622 --> 02:28:23.983]  Don't let the banksters cheat you!
[02:28:24.323 --> 02:28:25.204]  Fight back America!

[02:28:41.245 --> 02:28:42.827]  You lose nothing but the debt.
[02:28:45.012 --> 02:28:48.034]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:28:48.334 --> 02:28:53.277]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:53.538 --> 02:28:57.880]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:28:58.181 --> 02:29:07.086]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:29:07.307 --> 02:29:10.929]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:29:11.209 --> 02:29:16.232]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:29:16.532 --> 02:29:23.275]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:29:23.736 --> 02:29:24.296]  What about you?
[02:29:25.052 --> 02:29:30.399]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:29:45.738 --> 02:29:49.641]  Ladies, for healthier, more radiant skin and hair, you need to start flippin' it.
[02:29:49.961 --> 02:29:50.681]  Do you flip it?
[02:29:51.122 --> 02:29:53.443]  When I first started flippin' it, I couldn't believe my eyes.
[02:29:54.024 --> 02:29:56.025]  Once you start flippin' it, you'll never stop.
[02:29:56.525 --> 02:30:00.408]  The next time you pick up one of your beauty products, flip it over and examine the ingredients.
[02:30:00.768 --> 02:30:03.350]  You'll be astonished by what the packaging reveals to you.
[02:30:03.810 --> 02:30:08.233]  Many mainstream beauty products are comprised almost entirely of synthetic petrochemicals.
[02:30:08.673 --> 02:30:17.081]  For a more natural approach to looking and feeling great, visit NaturalSkinAndHair.com or call their friendly and knowledgeable staff toll free at 1-866-339-SKIN.

[02:30:46.169 --> 02:30:48.930]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:30:48.950 --> 02:30:52.851]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:56.552 --> 02:31:00.073]  Look, the same people that own George Bush own John Kerry.
[02:31:02.694 --> 02:31:11.737]  The only reason I think it might be good if John Kerry gets into office is because all of these conservatives, that I consider myself one,
[02:31:12.938 --> 02:31:29.174]  Who have been blind to the Trojan horse, the wolf in sheep's clothing, the globalist minion George Bush, that have gone to sleep and let this whole agenda go through, will wake up to what's happening and maybe fight back against it.
[02:31:29.575 --> 02:31:35.821]  The problem is then the left, who has woken up, the grassroots left, to the Patriot Act and Homeland Security and all this.
[02:31:36.565 --> 02:31:42.149]  They loved all the black ski masks and the secret police and all the things that were happening when Clinton was in.
[02:31:42.209 --> 02:31:44.071]  Now they all hate it and they're waking up.
[02:31:44.131 --> 02:31:48.354]  So, again, they continually play this game with us.
[02:31:48.474 --> 02:32:01.544]  But, you know, you call this a conservative court, I mean, this court was appointed by Republicans, two-thirds of it, and they have a, quote, more liberal voting record than the liberals on the court, overall.
[02:32:03.061 --> 02:32:04.962]  So again, it is just theater, folks.
[02:32:05.022 --> 02:32:06.842]  The whole thing is a production.
[02:32:07.842 --> 02:32:11.643]  And I just challenge people to realize that.
[02:32:12.084 --> 02:32:22.346]  And I have to tell you, Mark Umile, author of Bush Unplugged, that I've seen in bookstores, by the way, out there around the country, I mean, I disagree with you.
[02:32:24.167 --> 02:32:29.368]  Kerry is for this new domestic CIA with no congressional control.
[02:32:30.194 --> 02:32:30.775]  That's a nightmare.
[02:32:31.216 --> 02:32:44.015]  Terry is for almost every Bush policy, and I think we'll get different rhetoric, and he'll make takeovers of foreign countries more of a UN affair, but there's no real difference, Mark.
[02:32:45.666 --> 02:32:47.128]  I think there is a real difference.
[02:32:47.168 --> 02:32:49.752]  I mean, we're sort of on the same page on this, Alex.
[02:32:49.792 --> 02:32:51.935]  But look, I mentioned about the environment.
[02:32:51.955 --> 02:32:54.879]  I don't think anybody could be as disastrous on Bush on the environment.
[02:32:55.159 --> 02:33:00.166]  I don't think Kerry will allow big energy tycoons to dictate his national foreign policy.
[02:33:00.866 --> 02:33:06.488]  We're talking about tax cuts to the rich that are going to be hopefully repealed by Kerry, and more of a balanced tax cut.
[02:33:06.808 --> 02:33:09.049]  I do not believe in trickle-down-esque economics.
[02:33:09.089 --> 02:33:12.590]  It doesn't work for working people, and I think Kerry will stop that.
[02:33:12.850 --> 02:33:14.751]  I think he's going to get us some help in Iraq.
[02:33:15.051 --> 02:33:16.971]  He'll stop with this transfer of wealth.
[02:33:17.211 --> 02:33:20.513]  Look, corporate profits and CEO compensation have gone through the roof.
[02:33:20.913 --> 02:33:22.333]  Average people are still working harder.
[02:33:22.353 --> 02:33:24.514]  Yeah, the average American's income went down by 2% this year.
[02:33:25.254 --> 02:33:25.974]  That's right, Alex.
[02:33:25.994 --> 02:33:28.235]  I think Democrats will address that better.
[02:33:28.275 --> 02:33:31.657]  I'm just talking about the trickle-down effects for working people.
[02:33:31.717 --> 02:33:34.197]  I think we're going to be better off under these Democrats.
[02:33:34.237 --> 02:33:40.080]  And look, Alex, like you say, people are mobilized now more than any time in history to challenge their government.
[02:33:40.360 --> 02:33:43.181]  We're not going to go away if John Kerry... We're not going to relax.
[02:33:43.361 --> 02:33:45.542]  We're going to hold him to the highest accountable standards.
[02:33:45.602 --> 02:33:49.983]  And I think a Kerry administration would be much easier to police than a Bush administration.
[02:33:50.083 --> 02:33:51.304]  The most secretive
[02:33:52.105 --> 02:33:53.826]  Let me finish what you were saying.
[02:34:10.638 --> 02:34:17.163]  percent increase in CEO pay, all companies record profits, and this has been ill-gained, folks.
[02:34:17.603 --> 02:34:19.745]  This is not being gained to the free market.
[02:34:20.045 --> 02:34:24.689]  This is crony capitalism, or what you'd call fascism.
[02:34:25.169 --> 02:34:27.371]  They socialize our wealth and steal it.
[02:34:27.671 --> 02:34:31.774]  We have corporate looting going on everywhere, but Kerry isn't talking about that.
[02:34:32.535 --> 02:34:33.155]  That's the crime.
[02:34:33.435 --> 02:34:36.018]  That's the crime, and that's why he didn't get a bump in the polls.
[02:34:36.058 --> 02:34:38.981]  That's what I'm telling these Democrats all over the country when I talk to them.
[02:34:39.221 --> 02:34:42.404]  You want your guy to get a bump in the polls when he goes to his convention?
[02:34:42.684 --> 02:34:45.126]  Well, how about making some news for crying out loud?
[02:34:45.507 --> 02:34:49.190]  I mean, look, this is a corporate takeover that's going on in Iraq.
[02:34:49.270 --> 02:34:53.234]  You know, all Bush's crony corporations are going there and privatizing everything.
[02:34:53.514 --> 02:34:55.196]  It's a trickle-down dream come true.
[02:34:55.356 --> 02:35:08.025]  And again, privatization means they come to Austin and they say, we're taking all your roads and we're going to put a toll road in where a private company makes 20% of the money and that's privatization.
[02:35:08.065 --> 02:35:12.828]  Privatization is a guy sticking a gun to your head and saying, I own your house now, pay me.
[02:35:13.584 --> 02:35:24.055]  Or privatization is limiting public control of our electric utility grid and allowing the likes of Ken Lay and Enron to come in there and jack up prices.
[02:35:24.075 --> 02:35:27.759]  And set up fake computers to walk the legislature through.
[02:35:28.199 --> 02:35:32.924]  Oh, by the way, Alex, if I could just say, you can read all about it by going to BushUnplugged.com
[02:35:34.305 --> 02:35:44.149]  And one of the reasons why I wrote this book was not just to preach to the converted, but so that the converted can actually use this book as a tool to reach out to millions of Americans who just aren't getting it yet.
[02:35:44.610 --> 02:35:49.912]  Listen, we're talking about the privatization of Iraq, and I think this is something that's gone completely under the radar.
[02:35:50.232 --> 02:35:59.496]  The Center for Public Integrity identified more than 70 American companies and individuals that have won up to $8 billion in contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan, right?
[02:36:00.003 --> 02:36:11.252]  Those companies donated more money to presidential campaigns of George W. Bush than any other politician in history, but the Democrats don't have the guts to tell people what's going on over there.
[02:36:12.013 --> 02:36:25.023]  They don't have the guts to tell them the history of Halliburton and Bechtel, and their ties to the right-wing corporate elite, and how these people have helped this neoconservative agenda along, how there was a pre-existing plan to go into Iraq before
[02:36:25.344 --> 02:36:27.028]  Or George Bush was elected president.
[02:36:27.249 --> 02:36:31.039]  They lobbied Bill Clinton for the very same agenda.
[02:36:32.463 --> 02:36:33.404]  Yeah, with PENAC, that's right.
[02:36:33.464 --> 02:36:35.105]  I go into that in great detail in the book.
[02:36:35.145 --> 02:36:36.265]  Mark, Mark, let me say this.
[02:36:36.425 --> 02:36:38.567]  Look, again, I've read about half your book.
[02:36:38.727 --> 02:36:42.109]  I think the information on the corruption end is good and valuable.
[02:36:42.729 --> 02:36:45.811]  I'm saying I think your solutions are wrong.
[02:36:45.831 --> 02:36:47.532]  And I know you're saying, let's just get Bush out.
[02:36:48.432 --> 02:36:55.836]  And as long as we keep playing this game of there being a difference, we're not going to get accountability from the Democrats or the Republicans.
[02:36:55.856 --> 02:36:56.777]  Let's take some calls.
[02:36:57.657 --> 02:37:00.119]  Let's go ahead and talk to Roger first.
[02:37:01.174 --> 02:37:03.576]  Roger in Pennsylvania, then Lewis and others.
[02:37:03.716 --> 02:37:04.857]  Roger, you're on the air.
[02:37:05.217 --> 02:37:05.997]  Yeah, thanks.
[02:37:06.037 --> 02:37:18.786]  Just not exactly why I called, but that's a small fantasy that somehow you're going to bring Kerry along to somehow adopt the policies that are, you know, against corporate welfare, for example, by both the left and right.
[02:37:20.067 --> 02:37:24.529]  I wanted to adopt that, but as though he's not quite bought and paid for.
[02:37:24.850 --> 02:37:26.391]  But what I really called was about
[02:37:28.461 --> 02:37:44.656]  You know, we've been sold for a zillion years now this notion that somehow Nazi Germany, even though it had all the features and platforms of the left, this is supposed to have been an ultra right-wing phenomena.
[02:37:45.517 --> 02:37:49.561]  And so what I wanted to ask is, can you name any
[02:37:50.313 --> 02:37:55.296]  of the features advanced by the neocons who have really adopted all the socialism.
[02:37:55.316 --> 02:37:56.637]  Well, let me throw something into that.
[02:37:57.097 --> 02:38:06.043]  The Toronto Star, far from a right-wing publication, had a headline, The Ghost of Trotsky Walks the Halls of the White House.
[02:38:06.443 --> 02:38:13.608]  This is the Communist Fourth International that founded the neocon movement with Mr. Strauss and Mr. Kristol.
[02:38:14.734 --> 02:38:20.239]  At the same time, we have a doubling in the growth rate of government, what it was under Bill Clinton, under Bush.
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:21.040]  Exactly.
[02:38:21.100 --> 02:38:24.944]  I mean, saying this ultra-right-wing government, that plays into their hands.
[02:38:24.964 --> 02:38:26.705]  This is not a right-wing government.
[02:38:26.905 --> 02:38:33.571]  This is a corrupt, looting, whoremongering, I've never seen such
[02:38:35.553 --> 02:38:36.594]  Mass stealing.
[02:38:37.414 --> 02:38:40.795]  Hundreds of billions of dollars missing out of the Pentagon.
[02:38:41.036 --> 02:38:43.957]  A trillion-two over the last eight years.
[02:38:44.397 --> 02:38:45.658]  Comments to that, Mark?
[02:38:45.898 --> 02:38:47.458]  Could you hold on a second?
[02:38:47.538 --> 02:38:52.621]  Even Adolf Hitler commented that it was so much easier to absorb the so-called former communists.
[02:38:52.981 --> 02:38:54.882]  These were called the beefsteak Nazis.
[02:38:54.982 --> 02:38:57.803]  Red on the outside, but brown on the inside.
[02:38:59.029 --> 02:38:59.249]  Right.
[02:39:00.610 --> 02:39:12.339]  As far as my fellow Pennsylvanian just said about the fantasy of making Kerry accountable, my position is, and I think a lot of people believe, that at least we have a shot with Kerry.
[02:39:12.639 --> 02:39:15.702]  Listen, Benito Mussolini, the Italian dictator, right?
[02:39:15.742 --> 02:39:21.186]  He's the guy who taught Adolf Hitler a thing or two about how to run a fascist, hyper-nationalistic dictatorship.
[02:39:21.406 --> 02:39:21.986]  Here's what he said.
[02:39:24.707 --> 02:39:25.227]  We're good to go.
[02:39:48.184 --> 02:39:57.188]  Corporatists, they have this habit of wrapping themselves in the flag and condemning anyone that doesn't agree with their radical policies as unpatriotic backstabbing cowards.
[02:39:57.428 --> 02:39:58.569]  I mean, who does that sound like?
[02:39:58.969 --> 02:40:01.690]  They seek tight media control, the restriction of civil liberty.
[02:40:01.990 --> 02:40:06.012]  They absolutely never admit it to being wrong or make a mistake, no matter how glaring their errors.
[02:40:06.212 --> 02:40:08.513]  This is textbook what we're seeing out of this administration.
[02:40:08.773 --> 02:40:12.495]  And they're masters of propaganda and the use of euphemistic language.
[02:40:12.735 --> 02:40:18.398]  Healthy forests, the office of special plans, clear skies, to cover up the real intentions of their policies.
[02:40:18.418 --> 02:40:29.024]  So there's, yeah, you could say this is not a right-wing agenda, but it certainly is a neocon, corporatist, fascist agenda, thievery, thieving agenda that is hell-bent
[02:40:29.444 --> 02:40:35.369]  On consolidating wealth and transferring it to the top 1% of the nation's, you know, big... Okay.
[02:40:35.429 --> 02:40:36.030]  Alright.
[02:40:36.110 --> 02:40:37.491]  Roger, thanks for the call.
[02:40:38.913 --> 02:40:42.115]  Let's go ahead and talk to Louie in Texas.
[02:40:42.135 --> 02:40:42.776]  You're on the air.
[02:40:42.836 --> 02:40:43.276]  Go ahead.
[02:40:45.218 --> 02:40:45.598]  Yes, sir.
[02:40:45.618 --> 02:40:46.419]  How are you doing today?
[02:40:46.519 --> 02:40:46.800]  Good.
[02:40:47.400 --> 02:40:48.081]  Dr. Jones.
[02:40:48.461 --> 02:40:50.443]  Call me Dr. Jones.
[02:40:52.344 --> 02:40:53.545]  One comment I want to make.
[02:40:54.046 --> 02:40:54.666]  I reviewed the
[02:40:55.802 --> 02:40:56.483]  The Northwoods
[02:41:05.754 --> 02:41:06.855]  They said, ha ha, here it is.
[02:41:07.015 --> 02:41:09.156]  We just whiz, do what they had planned right here.
[02:41:09.856 --> 02:41:12.057]  It's so similar, it's unbelievable what they've done.
[02:41:12.377 --> 02:41:17.580]  Yeah, you have them blowing up ships, blaming it on people, bombing D.C., blaming it on people, killing U.S.
[02:41:17.600 --> 02:41:22.722]  troops, blaming it on enemies, hijacking jets by remote control, blaming it on foreigners.
[02:41:23.282 --> 02:41:26.344]  Were you aware of Operation Northwood's Mark of the Mile?
[02:41:26.986 --> 02:41:34.129]  I've only heard of it, I've never researched it because I've been head over heels investigating George Bush and company from the grassroots on up.
[02:41:34.169 --> 02:41:37.010]  Well, let me ask you, who do you think carried out 9-11, Mark?
[02:41:39.991 --> 02:41:47.355]  I really believe that it was staged by the old fascist al-Qaeda thugs that have had us in our sights since the early 90s.
[02:41:47.735 --> 02:41:49.515]  I believe that the plan had been
[02:41:51.075 --> 02:41:54.176]  I think you need to research this because you're going to find there's an official U.S.
[02:41:54.196 --> 02:41:55.416]  government plan to carry out 9-11 style attacks.
[02:42:16.941 --> 02:42:17.301]  That's right.
[02:42:17.462 --> 02:42:21.985]  However, Alex, I have to tell you, in Bush Unplugged, I don't go there.
[02:42:22.485 --> 02:42:29.810]  I am trying to get information to average American citizens who are completely in the dark, and to me, that's the next tier.
[02:42:30.491 --> 02:42:30.811]  Okay?
[02:42:31.111 --> 02:42:39.177]  I'm trying to break the veil, and I ask everybody to go to BushUnplugged.com, and if you know somebody who needs their veil broken, buy them a copy.
[02:42:39.637 --> 02:42:48.922]  And that'll open the door, and they will then be in a position where they can accept this next tier of information, because that is really scary for average people to digest.
[02:42:48.982 --> 02:42:50.663]  Alright, Louie, anything else?
[02:42:51.303 --> 02:42:57.386]  Yeah, yeah, I wanted to say that, you know, I watch commodity markets all the time, and their blood is that price of oil.
[02:42:57.706 --> 02:43:00.508]  That flows, that's their food.
[02:43:00.528 --> 02:43:01.548]  Bingo.
[02:43:02.108 --> 02:43:08.972]  And I'm telling you what, you know, almost every day I've been watching for the past three weeks, you know, there's, every time the price dips,
[02:43:10.376 --> 02:43:12.137]  Well, they blew up the pipeline here.
[02:43:12.337 --> 02:43:13.298]  You know, every time.
[02:43:13.618 --> 02:43:14.638]  Every single time.
[02:43:15.499 --> 02:43:18.200]  And not only that, all these car bombs everywhere.
[02:43:18.740 --> 02:43:20.361]  Every day there's a car bomb.
[02:43:20.401 --> 02:43:25.284]  These poor insurgents don't have stuff to make car bombs.
[02:43:25.324 --> 02:43:25.724]  This is
[02:43:26.457 --> 02:43:27.739]  This is manipulation.
[02:43:27.799 --> 02:43:30.422]  Well, it's like oil prices start going down, so there's an alert.
[02:43:30.462 --> 02:43:33.627]  Financial Centers, 44 plus dollars a barrel.
[02:43:33.667 --> 02:43:34.648]  Oh, record profits!
[02:43:35.149 --> 02:43:35.629]  There you go.
[02:43:35.990 --> 02:43:39.374]  Well, I'm looking at September crude right now, and it's at 40.
[02:43:39.454 --> 02:43:39.995]  It closed at 40.
[02:43:40.035 --> 02:43:42.318]  Well, it hasn't closed yet, but it's at 43.18 a barrel.
[02:43:44.039 --> 02:43:45.761]  I mean, and it is on its way up.
[02:43:46.061 --> 02:43:48.944]  It is gone through a correction, going higher.
[02:43:49.345 --> 02:43:51.607]  It went well over 44 two days ago.
[02:43:51.627 --> 02:43:54.230]  Well guys, isn't that the big lie of this war on terror?
[02:43:54.450 --> 02:43:58.555]  Listen, if there wasn't an oil, if we weren't
[02:43:59.572 --> 02:44:06.357]  The two central battle fronts in this war on terror are the two largest, have the two largest oil and gas reserves in the world.
[02:44:06.637 --> 02:44:07.798]  But nobody's talking about that.
[02:44:07.838 --> 02:44:14.582]  We're talking about good and evil instead of talking about money and power and territory and resources and markets, which all comes back to the oil equation.
[02:44:14.903 --> 02:44:15.823]  And that's where George Bush comes in.
[02:44:15.843 --> 02:44:16.384]  Well, let me add this.
[02:44:16.564 --> 02:44:23.608]  A lot of Americans, when they hear this, I've heard them on talk radio go, yeah, it's about oil and it's ours and we need it and Bush is sticking up for America.
[02:44:24.049 --> 02:44:25.630]  Folks, we're losing our jobs.
[02:44:26.701 --> 02:44:29.623]  Bush says outsourcing is our number one export.
[02:44:29.924 --> 02:44:33.487]  He says hamburger jobs are industrial high-tech jobs.
[02:44:33.867 --> 02:44:35.368]  I mean, you're talking... no, he said that.
[02:44:35.909 --> 02:44:38.951]  We're talking about la-la land propaganda.
[02:44:38.991 --> 02:44:41.333]  So, this oil isn't for you, okay?
[02:44:41.353 --> 02:44:43.575]  People think that it's being stolen for them.
[02:44:43.595 --> 02:44:47.538]  No, no, this is about controlling the market so they can jack the price up.
[02:44:47.858 --> 02:44:49.880]  They don't want that Iraqi oil to flow.
[02:44:50.180 --> 02:44:53.443]  By not having it flow, it jacks up global prices.
[02:44:53.483 --> 02:44:54.624]  So, Lewis, thanks for the call.
[02:44:54.664 --> 02:44:56.105]  Who's up next in Colorado there?
[02:44:58.411 --> 02:45:00.172]  Okay, Regina, you're on the air.
[02:45:00.252 --> 02:45:00.732]  Go ahead.
[02:45:00.752 --> 02:45:03.653]  Hi, Alex, and your guest.
[02:45:04.213 --> 02:45:04.573]  Welcome.
[02:45:04.874 --> 02:45:05.334]  Hi, Regina.
[02:45:05.994 --> 02:45:06.814]  Hi, Alex.
[02:45:06.834 --> 02:45:14.337]  Maybe somebody could interview you and you could tell him about the Patriot Act, because we know Mr. Kerry voted for the Patriot Act.
[02:45:15.078 --> 02:45:20.740]  I remember a section of Homeland Security, exposed by the America Free Press right after it passed, about
[02:45:21.547 --> 02:45:23.448]  Closing off critical infrastructure.
[02:45:23.468 --> 02:45:24.488]  Do you remember that Alex?
[02:45:24.568 --> 02:45:27.589]  As far as being able to use the Freedom of Information Act in that?
[02:45:27.949 --> 02:45:28.289]  Yes.
[02:45:28.529 --> 02:45:30.570]  And so that is Kerry that supported that.
[02:45:30.610 --> 02:45:32.190]  And Kerry supported the Patriot Act.
[02:45:32.230 --> 02:45:33.651]  And all of a sudden he's our savior.
[02:45:33.691 --> 02:45:34.771]  I have a problem with that.
[02:45:35.211 --> 02:45:43.234]  His wife is Theresa Hines, who's big into eminent domain for private property so they can take over the property ownership.
[02:45:43.294 --> 02:45:46.154]  In Pittsburgh a lot of property has been taken over by eminent domain.
[02:45:46.495 --> 02:45:47.755]  And then we came in with a plan
[02:45:48.226 --> 02:45:57.188]  From both of these guys, signed by Bush, passed by Kerry, that we have to follow to put everything in the agenda of the United Nations and the federal government.
[02:45:57.468 --> 02:46:03.670]  You know, my thing is that people ought to really say no to the Bush-Kerry Together movement.
[02:46:04.070 --> 02:46:06.250]  Yeah, I called the Bush-Kerry ticket.
[02:46:06.590 --> 02:46:07.991]  Right.
[02:46:08.071 --> 02:46:11.592]  And say, let's go outside of this and say, we're not going to vote for either one of you.
[02:46:11.632 --> 02:46:13.412]  You both are taking us down into a rat hole.
[02:46:14.042 --> 02:46:18.165]  Let's find a third party that fits your agenda, and let's go after the Patriot Act.
[02:46:18.225 --> 02:46:20.727]  I don't see Mr. Kerry, he didn't say a word about it.
[02:46:20.847 --> 02:46:25.811]  I don't know if your guest there looked at it on your site about what was going on at the Democratic Convention.
[02:46:26.431 --> 02:46:36.079]  The only one that stood up on Jack Blood was the guy from Maryland who explained to all the protesters all the things that could happen to them under the Patriot Act.
[02:46:36.679 --> 02:46:40.542]  I think we do a disservice when we don't look at the people who are doing this to us.
[02:46:42.032 --> 02:46:43.814]  No, I do agree with Regina.
[02:46:44.335 --> 02:46:46.657]  Kerry did vote for the Patriot Act.
[02:46:46.697 --> 02:46:51.303]  He voted for the war in Iraq, and it doesn't give him a lot of credibility when he speaks out against it.
[02:46:51.563 --> 02:46:57.049]  However, we are facing something called Patriot Act II, with an erosion of civil liberties.
[02:46:57.810 --> 02:47:03.174]  I do not think that John Kerry is going to push that legislation if he becomes president.
[02:47:03.194 --> 02:47:07.336]  There is a sunset provision on the Patriot Act, and it can't expire.
[02:47:08.397 --> 02:47:11.019]  That's a major scam, just so you know, if you actually read it.
[02:47:11.459 --> 02:47:14.241]  All the key draconian provisions are not sunsetted.
[02:47:14.881 --> 02:47:21.446]  And then, really, if you notice when Bush says, reauthorize and expand, they built in an expansion mechanism
[02:47:22.267 --> 02:47:24.611]  Well, that's also if Bush is elected.
[02:47:24.631 --> 02:47:28.858]  However, if Kerry gets elected, he knows that his base, the people that brought him to power,
[02:47:35.328 --> 02:47:41.051]  Could abandon him if he doesn't follow a step on the Patriot Act and not vote for Patriot Act 2.
[02:47:41.311 --> 02:47:42.471]  So there is a difference there.
[02:47:42.711 --> 02:47:45.012]  Not a major difference, but there's a difference to me.
[02:47:45.092 --> 02:47:46.093]  And where are they going to go?
[02:47:46.373 --> 02:47:47.053]  You know what I mean?
[02:47:47.073 --> 02:47:49.114]  I mean, this country's about gone.
[02:47:49.354 --> 02:47:52.155]  And Alex Jones has been exposed in the Patriot Act for years.
[02:47:52.256 --> 02:47:53.476]  And it's just like George Bush.
[02:47:54.176 --> 02:47:54.997]  Oh, he did that.
[02:47:55.357 --> 02:47:58.998]  You know, we gave veto power to Clinton, but he still doesn't use veto power.
[02:47:59.019 --> 02:47:59.879]  Will Kerry use it?
[02:48:00.699 --> 02:48:01.420]  We can only see.
[02:48:01.460 --> 02:48:02.000]  We can only see.
[02:48:02.020 --> 02:48:04.081]  Well, I'm going to let you in for him.
[02:48:04.301 --> 02:48:04.581]  Thanks.
[02:48:05.623 --> 02:48:12.165]  Okay, Mr. Umile, the author of Bush Unplugged, thanks for coming on with us, and take care.
[02:48:12.185 --> 02:48:17.686]  I think your book's got some good information, and I don't agree that Kerry is going to save us.
[02:48:17.706 --> 02:48:33.251]  I know you're concerned about Bush, who's an abject criminal, and I agree with you, but again, they keep playing us like fools with this WWF wrestling situation, this pageant, and it's time to rise above it.
[02:48:33.511 --> 02:48:34.351]  But thanks for coming on.
[02:48:35.040 --> 02:48:35.601]  Thanks, Doc.
[02:48:35.921 --> 02:48:36.282]  You bet.
[02:48:36.402 --> 02:48:40.767]  We'll be back with a final segment, a few final news stories, and I'll tell you about my videos as well.
[02:48:40.827 --> 02:48:41.188]  Stay with us.
[02:48:46.130 --> 02:48:53.495]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:48:53.775 --> 02:48:58.518]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:48:58.739 --> 02:49:04.422]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:49:04.622 --> 02:49:09.125]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:49:16.150 --> 02:49:16.991]  We're good to go.
[02:49:45.638 --> 02:49:48.622]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:49:48.983 --> 02:49:57.814]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:49:58.135 --> 02:50:02.801]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:03.261 --> 02:50:09.983]  The Berkelite is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:10.383 --> 02:50:22.186]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:22.646 --> 02:50:27.109]  The Berkey Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:50:27.269 --> 02:50:29.611]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:29.631 --> 02:50:31.593]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:50:31.613 --> 02:50:32.813]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:50:32.873 --> 02:50:34.334]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:50:34.354 --> 02:50:35.415]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:50:45.913 --> 02:50:46.434]  Thank you.
[02:51:01.292 --> 02:51:01.953]  We're good to go!
[02:51:30.834 --> 02:51:33.896]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:34.076 --> 02:51:40.020]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:50.086 --> 02:51:52.007]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:51:52.487 --> 02:51:55.229]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:56.858 --> 02:52:00.840]  The Associated Press is reporting, black box recommended for all vehicles.
[02:52:00.900 --> 02:52:04.181]  The government should require data recorders in all passenger vehicles.
[02:52:04.241 --> 02:52:11.904]  Federal safety officials said yesterday in a recommendation arising from the investigation of a car crash with guilt in people and injured 63.
[02:52:12.444 --> 02:52:17.506]  And it just so happens that all the new cars already have it put in them, so it's a lot of fun.
[02:52:18.006 --> 02:52:19.927]  And I wanted to read part of this editorial.
[02:52:20.712 --> 02:52:26.016]  Out of the Courier Times, from Fortress Boston in 1984, by J.D.
[02:52:26.476 --> 02:52:26.997]  Mullane.
[02:52:27.537 --> 02:52:39.486]  In high school, as I read in 1984, my English teacher, Stephen Walker, said, fear of a falling victim to random violence would usher in George Orwell's frightening vision and undo America.
[02:52:40.527 --> 02:52:44.050]  This was the late seventies and climbing murder rates gripped most major cities.
[02:52:44.130 --> 02:52:48.153]  Big crime worked its way into sedate suburbs too,
[02:52:49.418 --> 02:52:52.159]  Where people were always surprised that it could happen here.
[02:52:52.739 --> 02:52:58.421]  Walker said that like terminal cancer, in the future everyone would know someone who was a victim of a life-ending crime.
[02:52:58.761 --> 02:53:04.143]  Then government would be handed sweeping powers to snag the killers before they snuffed us.
[02:53:04.763 --> 02:53:05.604]  Life would be harsh.
[02:53:05.704 --> 02:53:09.685]  Only those with credentials would travel, and only to certain zones at appointed times.
[02:53:10.105 --> 02:53:15.687]  Cameras on street corners and satellites in orbit would monitor everything that moved from city to city, town to town, block to block.
[02:53:16.247 --> 02:53:17.609]  Neighborhoods would be gated.
[02:53:17.789 --> 02:53:21.452]  When the bad guys figured out a way to penetrate the gates, walls would go up.
[02:53:21.473 --> 02:53:25.857]  When the walls failed, armed military tanks would guard neighborhood entrances.
[02:53:26.397 --> 02:53:36.688]  I imagined a hulking green tank with its gun aimed towards the windows of Manor Elementary School as I sat at the entrance to the Levittstown North Park section where I grew up.
[02:53:36.848 --> 02:53:39.731]  Over the years, I've chuckled at that unthinkable.
[02:53:40.251 --> 02:53:45.432]  But then I spent last week in Boston at the Democratic National Convention amid oppressive security.
[02:53:45.832 --> 02:53:51.214]  Fear of sudden death of large scale was in complete control in Beat Town.
[02:53:51.574 --> 02:53:54.914]  And then he lays out how they're doing it to us on purpose.
[02:53:56.175 --> 02:53:57.995]  I want to try to get a call in here at the end.
[02:53:58.015 --> 02:54:00.136]  I'll try to go to Darren here in a second.
[02:54:00.196 --> 02:54:01.396]  I do have to say that
[02:54:02.475 --> 02:54:03.456]  This is our country.
[02:54:03.496 --> 02:54:05.057]  It does not belong to the globalists.
[02:54:05.397 --> 02:54:08.579]  They can only get away with this if they scare us into going along with it.
[02:54:08.919 --> 02:54:10.300]  They need us to go along with it.
[02:54:10.320 --> 02:54:11.581]  They're not all powerful.
[02:54:11.961 --> 02:54:20.086]  The government's made up of people just like you and I. And it's time for those individuals to wake up, get off the bench, break their conditioning, and defend this country.
[02:54:20.967 --> 02:54:25.790]  Your common sense, your guts, your bones should tell you the truth of what we're facing.
[02:54:26.483 --> 02:54:33.565]  I challenge all of you to visit Infowars.com and to link through via our safe secure shopping cart and to get my videos.
[02:54:33.606 --> 02:54:35.066]  To get my 9-11 films.
[02:54:35.446 --> 02:54:38.207]  To get them and to make copies and to get them out into people's hands.
[02:54:38.487 --> 02:54:41.908]  And if you have copies of my films and haven't made copies, you need to!
[02:54:42.228 --> 02:54:47.410]  We need to expose the murderers that carried out 9-11 before they carry out more attacks!
[02:54:48.731 --> 02:54:52.172]  And those murderers are represented by John Kerry and George Bush.
[02:54:53.197 --> 02:54:56.460]  So go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:54:56.800 --> 02:55:00.324]  Got several other new 9-11 videos by other great people you can get as well.
[02:55:00.344 --> 02:55:02.186]  A lot of other great books and films.
[02:55:03.507 --> 02:55:07.290]  The toll free number to order the videos or the books is 1-888-253-3139.
[02:55:07.791 --> 02:55:13.176]  You can call and ask questions about titles and discounts we have.
[02:55:14.273 --> 02:55:14.514]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:55:14.734 --> 02:55:21.240]  Take that first step in the fight against the Globalists.
[02:55:21.501 --> 02:55:22.241]  Get the videos.
[02:55:22.302 --> 02:55:24.063]  Get them out to people.
[02:55:24.083 --> 02:55:24.864]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:55:25.325 --> 02:55:32.192]  Or as I said, InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:55:33.073 --> 02:55:34.394]  Darren in Colorado.
[02:55:34.434 --> 02:55:35.055]  Last caller.
[02:55:35.095 --> 02:55:35.875]  You're our tail gunner.
[02:55:35.915 --> 02:55:36.296]  Go ahead.
[02:55:37.065 --> 02:55:38.306]  Yes, Alex, thank you.
[02:55:38.786 --> 02:55:45.430]  And I'd like to start with saying that if I have time, I'd like to get into Yale University, a book they printed back in 1960.
[02:55:45.730 --> 02:55:46.971]  He got 45 seconds.
[02:55:46.991 --> 02:55:59.518]  It refers to Scott Bush, but I was approached by a friend, by an agent provocateur, who would like to get people to go out and kill politicians.
[02:56:00.879 --> 02:56:05.782]  Obviously, he was an agent of the federal, and of course,
[02:56:06.229 --> 02:56:07.530]  Yeah, we should get to know our neighbors.
[02:56:08.290 --> 02:56:11.492]  We should get involved in our society.
[02:56:11.512 --> 02:56:13.373]  That's a big part of the solution.
[02:56:13.393 --> 02:56:14.393]  Thank you for the call.
[02:56:14.413 --> 02:56:15.914]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:15.954 --> 02:56:16.574]  Back tomorrow.
[02:56:16.594 --> 02:56:16.814]  Take care.
