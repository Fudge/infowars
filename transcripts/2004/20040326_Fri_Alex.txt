[00:00:03.623 --> 00:00:04.263]  Big Brother.
[00:00:04.924 --> 00:00:06.005]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:06.686 --> 00:00:07.787]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:08.448 --> 00:00:09.248]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:10.930]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.335]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:15.775 --> 00:00:18.118]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[00:00:19.017 --> 00:00:19.878]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.324 --> 00:00:28.444]  All right, my friends.
[00:00:29.065 --> 00:00:35.710]  Another week of broadcast is about to conclude here in just a few hours.
[00:00:37.451 --> 00:00:38.932]  Time is just flying past us.
[00:00:39.032 --> 00:00:42.455]  It is the 26th day of March 2004.
[00:00:42.735 --> 00:00:47.239]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and we'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:56.427]  We have Tom Flacco joining us, and Tom is a journalist who's written for major publications like World Net Daily and Newsmax.
[00:00:57.007 --> 00:00:58.308]  He's an investigative reporter.
[00:00:58.388 --> 00:01:02.191]  He's been at all of the whitewash hearings that have been open to the public.
[00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:14.099]  He's broken dozens of major news stories concerning 9-11, and with some of the latest revelations, he'll be bringing those forward in the second hour, so in about 59 minutes.
[00:01:16.425 --> 00:01:21.630]  In the third hour, Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster has some amazing predictions.
[00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.652]  An economist, of course, former Army intelligence.
[00:01:25.113 --> 00:01:29.537]  We'll talk about the economy and also his take on the Madrid bombings in the third hour.
[00:01:30.278 --> 00:01:33.861]  And, of course, we'll have wide open phones throughout the broadcast.
[00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:36.011]  Wide open phone lines, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:36.051 --> 00:01:40.473]  We'll go to your calls early in the shower and take a lot of your calls.
[00:01:40.493 --> 00:01:40.573]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:43.914]  Websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, both updated daily for you.
[00:01:58.976 --> 00:02:07.399]  You know, I mentioned this UNICEF Nigerian polio vaccine contaminated with sterilizing agents scientists find.
[00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:09.280]  I covered this in the third hour.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.140]  I didn't spend enough time on it.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.922]  I'm going to cover it for five minutes or so in this first hour after I get some more in the news.
[00:02:16.982 --> 00:02:18.363]  Because this just shows you...
[00:02:19.702 --> 00:02:30.824]  The mindset of the globalists caught red-handed in how any of us could trust any vaccines or the water or anything the government's providing us is insane.
[00:02:33.145 --> 00:02:36.506]  And I'll go over some of the history of the mass sterilization program going on.
[00:02:36.546 --> 00:02:39.266]  You wonder why the women are becoming infertile while the men are.
[00:02:39.806 --> 00:02:41.867]  A lot of it is by design.
[00:02:41.987 --> 00:02:46.528]  This is confirmed from official Australian, British, EU, U.S.
[00:02:46.568 --> 00:02:47.428]  government documents.
[00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:49.430]  So that's coming up.
[00:02:50.111 --> 00:02:54.035]  China says it won't sit by if Taiwan turmoil worsens.
[00:02:54.736 --> 00:03:08.932]  After the President and the Vice President got shot last Friday, seven days ago, we will also then get into two bills now pending to bring back the draft, and they're very close to passing.
[00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:11.646]  We'll go over those.
[00:03:11.746 --> 00:03:15.547]  GPS tracks state youth offenders moving in with Big Brother.
[00:03:16.007 --> 00:03:22.049]  Civil Liberties Group's cry foul over EU anti-terrorism plans getting rid of all their freedoms, just like the Patriot Act.
[00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.930]  Blair to offer Libya military training.
[00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.070]  We've always been at war with East Asia.
[00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.111]  We've never been at war with East Asia.
[00:03:29.211 --> 00:03:32.271]  It's just one day they're the enemy, next day they're the friend.
[00:03:33.172 --> 00:03:36.712]  So we'll get into Blair's horrific plan to sell arms to Libya.
[00:03:36.732 --> 00:03:38.653]  Well, Israel's always selling them to Iran.
[00:03:40.251 --> 00:03:40.912]  Also, U.S.
[00:03:40.972 --> 00:03:43.496]  sent medically unfit soldiers to Iraq.
[00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:45.498]  Pentagon acknowledges.
[00:03:46.741 --> 00:03:47.721]  I think we're good to go.
[00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:24.828]  We've got a time when you can listen to the show, and if your local AM or FM isn't picking it up during those hours, you can always listen at GCNlive.com or Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:29.701]  But again, any of these issues I've mentioned, you're welcome to call in about it.
[00:04:29.721 --> 00:04:38.406]  If there's any news item you think is important, just have your question, your comment ready, because we want to go to calls quickly and get as many of you in as possible.
[00:04:38.446 --> 00:04:45.970]  I know it's frustrating for a lot of people that try to call in week after week and either can't get through or we never get to you, but we're trying to change that and we've been doing a better job of it.
[00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:47.491]  So again...
[00:04:48.217 --> 00:04:51.766]  1-800-259-9231 Shortwave frequencies, by the way, are 94.75 during the day, 32.10 at night.
[00:05:00.262 --> 00:05:02.304]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[00:05:02.484 --> 00:05:04.125]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot.
[00:05:04.265 --> 00:05:12.251]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:18.916]  Imagine hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini followed by peaches, mixed root, or pineapple for dessert.
[00:05:19.096 --> 00:05:20.357]  Just a few of the many selections.
[00:05:20.557 --> 00:05:23.899]  Visit www.longlifefood.com for a complete menu.
[00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:27.642]  Both FEMA and the Red Cross have suggested having food stored in case of disasters.
[00:05:27.862 --> 00:05:33.346]  The Long Life Food Depot was recently mentioned in a USA Today article on the very subject of emergency preparations.
[00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:36.408]  It makes sense to be prepared and Long Life Food Depot makes it easy.
[00:05:36.588 --> 00:05:40.611]  Long-term storable MREs make for convenience when camping, hiking, or canoeing.
[00:05:40.831 --> 00:05:42.773]  No fires allowed, hot meals still are.
[00:05:42.893 --> 00:05:47.276]  Call the Long Life Food Depot toll-free at 800-601-2833.
[00:05:47.316 --> 00:05:52.099]  That's 1-800-601-2833 or visit longlifefood.com.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.642]  The Long Life Food Depot offers free shipping via UPS ground on every order.
[00:05:55.782 --> 00:05:56.203]  Don't wait.
[00:05:56.343 --> 00:05:58.045]  Call the Long Life Food Depot today.
[00:05:59.006 --> 00:06:03.331]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:07.956]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:08.096 --> 00:06:12.481]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:06:12.521 --> 00:06:13.862]  The New World Order.
[00:06:15.643 --> 00:06:19.865]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:19.925 --> 00:06:26.847]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:26.987 --> 00:06:28.988]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:29.428 --> 00:06:39.773]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:39.994 --> 00:06:45.356]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:06:45.877 --> 00:06:48.538]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:06:48.618 --> 00:06:49.398]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:49.418 --> 00:06:49.899]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:50.939]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:58.443 --> 00:07:00.043]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:00.403 --> 00:07:06.145]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:07:06.405 --> 00:07:11.526]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:07:11.886 --> 00:07:21.148]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:07:21.508 --> 00:07:26.470]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.792]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:35.734]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:07:36.134 --> 00:07:42.036]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:07:42.376 --> 00:07:48.603]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:07:48.643 --> 00:07:49.624]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:07:49.704 --> 00:07:50.585]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:08:03.678 --> 00:08:04.338]  Big Brother.
[00:08:04.999 --> 00:08:06.039]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.880]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:09.341]  You want answers?
[00:08:10.102 --> 00:08:10.982]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:11.002 --> 00:08:15.445]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.845 --> 00:08:19.967]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:21.508 --> 00:08:22.528]  All right, my friends.
[00:08:22.749 --> 00:08:25.290]  It is Friday, the 26th of March, 2004.
[00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:32.514]  In about 52 minutes, we're going to have Tom Flocko, investigative journalist, writer for Newsmax, World Net Daily, you name it,
[00:08:33.186 --> 00:08:35.868]  ...of cameras surround these individuals that are bringing this information forward.
[00:08:35.888 --> 00:08:37.589]  Then in the third hour, Bob Chapman, economist...
[00:09:02.166 --> 00:09:16.758]  Author, of course, former Army intelligence, will get into the economy, the plunging dollar, and what he thinks about the Madrid bombings over in Spain from his educated point of view that I concur with by the way.
[00:09:17.698 --> 00:09:22.642]  So that's coming up in the second and third hours, of course, as I said, wide open phones, 800-259-9231.
[00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:24.724]  In about 30 minutes or so, I will air a clip
[00:09:31.832 --> 00:09:42.656]  That we posted on PrisonPlanet.com that originated from the Richard Milhouse Nixon Presidential Library.
[00:09:43.677 --> 00:09:56.801]  Now, I first read an Associated Press article, I guess six years ago when I was doing research, or five years ago when I was doing research on Bohemian Grove and Tex Mars' archives.
[00:09:56.861 --> 00:09:59.202]  He has several rooms just full of files.
[00:10:00.193 --> 00:10:06.423]  And it quoted Richard Nixon as talking about Bohemian Grove in a bad light.
[00:10:06.744 --> 00:10:08.948]  And so I've mentioned that article on air.
[00:10:09.048 --> 00:10:10.250]  I've talked about it.
[00:10:11.365 --> 00:10:25.013]  Well, lo and behold, we posted this on prisonplanet.com where Richard Nixon has some interesting things to say about the Bohemian Grove.
[00:10:25.173 --> 00:10:33.318]  And I'm sure a lot of you have heard other presidential phone call conversations from LBJ, Kennedy, even Reagan.
[00:10:33.338 --> 00:10:35.179]  They're not very high quality.
[00:10:35.199 --> 00:10:39.942]  I mean, if you listen carefully, you can hear everything he's saying on the website.
[00:10:39.962 --> 00:10:41.043]  We're going to broadcast it.
[00:10:46.204 --> 00:10:52.427]  So you definitely do not want to miss that when it's coming up a little bit later in the show.
[00:10:53.668 --> 00:10:56.770]  Right now, though, I want to continue with the news.
[00:10:58.531 --> 00:11:03.234]  And I want to go back to an article that I covered a little bit yesterday, but not properly.
[00:11:03.954 --> 00:11:12.419]  Because it's such a big deal, it's such a smoking gun, into the mindset of the globalists and the criminal activities they're engaged in.
[00:11:14.053 --> 00:11:19.314]  Now, by turn of the century, they had the social Darwinists, the H.G.
[00:11:19.374 --> 00:11:28.377]  Wells types of the world, who were calling for a new world order, who were calling for sterilizing most of the people on the planet, who were calling for a one-child policy.
[00:11:28.957 --> 00:11:35.719]  They had the Malthusian view that the masses of people dying was no big deal.
[00:11:36.627 --> 00:11:43.352]  And there are literally hundreds and hundreds of prestigious publications over just the last few decades.
[00:11:43.973 --> 00:11:52.420]  And this is what you'll hear at any martini party with the sociology or biology professors at a major university.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:53.881]  The people bomb.
[00:11:53.941 --> 00:11:58.104]  How we've got to get rid of 80 to 95% of the population.
[00:11:58.184 --> 00:12:05.070]  Prince Philip in his own publication, If I Was an Animal, that he wrote in 1987, says I'd like to come back as a particularly deadly virus.
[00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:09.493]  To kill 80-plus percent of the population.
[00:12:10.193 --> 00:12:24.462]  Ted Turner, back in the mid-90s, actually in 1997, at a press dinner live on C-SPAN, said, and it was also picked up by Audubon Magazine, that we need to kill 95% of the useless feeders.
[00:12:24.542 --> 00:12:27.104]  That, by the way, is an Adolf Hitler quote.
[00:12:28.283 --> 00:12:33.105]  Margaret Sanger gave awards to Hitler, got awards from Hitler, helped them set up their eugenics program.
[00:12:33.405 --> 00:12:35.346]  Planned Parenthood today in this country.
[00:12:35.826 --> 00:12:41.168]  And we have the 1973 declassified documents of Dr. Henry Kissinger, declassified in 1992.
[00:12:41.248 --> 00:12:45.069]  We've posted those on the main page many, many times.
[00:12:45.289 --> 00:12:47.310]  Just use the search engine on InfoAwards.com.
[00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:51.632]  Type in Henry Kissinger population control programs.
[00:12:51.652 --> 00:12:52.672]  It should pop up for you.
[00:12:54.379 --> 00:13:01.961]  They told the five most populous third world countries, sterilize half of your population or you'll get no IMF or World Bank money.
[00:13:02.562 --> 00:13:12.525]  And then all over the globe, from India to China to Nigeria, they would just go around grabbing poor women and would tie their tubes.
[00:13:13.785 --> 00:13:14.986]  So this is going on.
[00:13:15.366 --> 00:13:16.346]  This is their program.
[00:13:16.406 --> 00:13:17.966]  This is what they're up to.
[00:13:18.026 --> 00:13:19.627]  This is what they believe in.
[00:13:21.528 --> 00:13:36.713]  And a major pro-life group in Canada, LifeSite, took several mainstream articles and put their own story together, and they reported years ago that it's not the first time that UNICEF has been embroiled in a controversy over sterilizing agents and vaccines.
[00:13:37.373 --> 00:13:46.216]  They reported that in 1995, the Catholic Women's League of the Philippines won a court order halting a UNICEF anti-technist program because the vaccine had been laced with B-HCG.
[00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:49.890]  We're good to go.
[00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:50.711]  We're good to go.
[00:14:13.448 --> 00:14:23.653]  A top Indian scientist from India did a test of vaccines being used in Africa and India, other third world countries, at one of the most prestigious laboratories in India.
[00:14:24.233 --> 00:14:32.237]  And they found a new sterilizing agent bonded to the pathogen in the vaccine.
[00:14:32.257 --> 00:14:34.818]  That is what the body creates an autoimmune response to.
[00:14:34.858 --> 00:14:38.100]  They bind it to other chemicals or agents.
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:43.861]  Other living agents, depending on which one they choose to use, and then it sterilizes the woman.
[00:14:45.042 --> 00:14:56.625]  And time and time again, when the UN gets caught doing this with different manufacturers in different countries, magically these expensive synthetic products get added, agents get added, they say, oh, it's an accident.
[00:14:56.665 --> 00:14:59.425]  But it's not an accident because the programs are only for women.
[00:14:59.725 --> 00:15:05.707]  This is sold as UN funding for women's health programs, which all your loving liberals go out and lobby for.
[00:15:06.167 --> 00:15:07.308]  More for women.
[00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:08.510]  Women deserve it.
[00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:10.952]  Oh, you certainly do, the globalists say.
[00:15:10.992 --> 00:15:15.337]  And so they go out and target women because this stuff wouldn't hurt men.
[00:15:15.377 --> 00:15:17.419]  It wouldn't sterilize men.
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.022]  They have other ways of doing that.
[00:15:20.885 --> 00:15:29.731]  The water supply, chemically, they admit, I have dozens and dozens, actually hundreds of major studies, top scientists, epidemiologists, biologists on this show.
[00:15:29.751 --> 00:15:31.752]  I mean, Nobel Prize winners have been on this show.
[00:15:32.132 --> 00:15:44.880]  Sodium fluoride in even low levels reduces your sperm count massively, and that's why in countries that have been fluoridating, you have 75% to 85% reductions in sperm counts and sterility in millions and millions of men.
[00:15:46.343 --> 00:15:52.828]  But continuing with this article, UNICEF Nigerian polio vaccine contaminated with sterilizing agents.
[00:15:53.989 --> 00:16:02.616]  Scientist finds a UNICEF campaign to vaccinate Nigeria's youth against polio may have been a front for sterilizing the nation.
[00:16:02.636 --> 00:16:03.017]  Dr. Haruna...
[00:16:05.231 --> 00:16:17.939]  Kaita, a pharmacological scientist and dean of the facility of pharmacological sciences of Abdu'l-Belo University in Zaire, took samples of the vaccine to labs in India for analysis.
[00:16:18.539 --> 00:16:25.243]  Using World Health Organization-recommended technologies like gas chromatography, or GC, and radio...
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:32.025]  I have some other professional colleagues who are Indians who are in the lab and cannot believe the discovery.
[00:16:32.045 --> 00:16:32.345]  He said...
[00:16:51.821 --> 00:17:00.247]  When asked by the Trust newspaper why the doctor felt the drug manufacturers would have contaminated the oral polio vaccine, he gave three reasons.
[00:17:00.727 --> 00:17:07.291]  These manufacturers or promoters of these harmful things have a secret agenda which only further research can reveal.
[00:17:07.311 --> 00:17:08.452]  Well, we've done that research, sir.
[00:17:09.012 --> 00:17:19.200]  Secondarily, they have always taken us in the third world for granted, thinking we don't have the capability, capacity, knowledge, and equipment to conduct tests that would reveal such contaminants.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:23.924]  And very unfortunately, they also have people to defend their atrocities within our midst.
[00:17:23.984 --> 00:17:24.724]  You know, we're paid off.
[00:17:25.024 --> 00:17:30.869]  And worse still, some of these are supposed to be our professionals who we rely on to protect our interests.
[00:17:31.949 --> 00:17:32.449]  Alex Jones Show!
[00:17:32.469 --> 00:17:32.930]  We're good to go.
[00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:33.170]  I think?
[00:17:57.785 --> 00:17:58.806]  He goes, I won't tell you the names.
[00:17:58.846 --> 00:17:59.886]  I know you'll go on the air with it.
[00:17:59.906 --> 00:18:01.448]  But he said they were still giving.
[00:18:01.488 --> 00:18:02.228]  He said last month.
[00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:03.149]  So this is seven months ago.
[00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:17.939]  He said they were still giving the oral polio vaccine despite the fact that it's not supposed to be used in America because they admit that it has SV40, a very aggressive, deadly form of cancer virus.
[00:18:20.303 --> 00:18:23.445]  This monkey virus, humans didn't have all these new weird forms of cancers.
[00:18:23.665 --> 00:18:24.746]  They admit it's causing them.
[00:18:24.786 --> 00:18:28.608]  I mean, weird cancers in the brain that look like purple yogurt.
[00:18:28.648 --> 00:18:29.949]  I mean, these are the descriptions.
[00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.151]  All these new horrible cancers.
[00:18:32.791 --> 00:18:36.613]  I mean, it's just flesh-eating cancers.
[00:18:37.254 --> 00:18:38.995]  Just accelerated cancers.
[00:18:40.171 --> 00:18:45.995]  Again, they banned it in the use of the Western world because they admit it's deadly, but it continues for the third world.
[00:18:46.035 --> 00:18:50.658]  And he said, oh, they're still giving this 30-year-old vaccine right here in Austin, Texas.
[00:18:52.058 --> 00:19:01.865]  How many of you listening in Austin went and slurped it down with pleasure because you didn't want to believe that radical Alex Jones?
[00:19:02.978 --> 00:19:10.987]  That guy that makes up stuff about an imaginary group called Skull and Bones and that crazy who believes there's a world government as the presidents announce it.
[00:19:11.748 --> 00:19:13.510]  I mean, this is the horror, my friends.
[00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:17.795]  I hope you'll go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.361]  And I hope you'll read these news articles.
[00:19:20.401 --> 00:19:22.923]  I mean, just a month ago it came out, CDC's own documents.
[00:19:23.143 --> 00:19:26.406]  They admit it's brain damaging tens of thousands of children every year.
[00:19:26.526 --> 00:19:29.648]  Millions have been damaged in the aggregate by the thimerosal mercury.
[00:19:29.688 --> 00:19:30.589]  It's going to continue.
[00:19:31.289 --> 00:19:34.532]  They talk about the documents, how to cover it up, how to continue it.
[00:19:35.112 --> 00:19:36.093]  Why have we stopped it?
[00:19:36.113 --> 00:19:37.034]  They'll get wise.
[00:19:37.074 --> 00:19:38.134]  We've got to continue.
[00:19:38.154 --> 00:19:40.356]  I mean, how do they sleep at night?
[00:19:41.397 --> 00:19:45.360]  It's part of a concerted program.
[00:19:46.371 --> 00:19:50.433]  To brain damage you, and when you get overly brain damaged, then you get the autism.
[00:19:50.653 --> 00:19:56.155]  The rest of the public are just having a 20 to 30 percent IQ point reduction.
[00:19:56.315 --> 00:19:57.716]  It is Brave New World.
[00:19:59.349 --> 00:20:07.953]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:20:08.173 --> 00:20:19.459]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:20:19.679 --> 00:20:22.300]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:29.123]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:20:29.283 --> 00:20:31.144]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:20:31.344 --> 00:20:37.367]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:20:37.627 --> 00:20:43.290]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:47.772]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:20:47.792 --> 00:20:48.413]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:20:48.433 --> 00:20:50.374]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:20:59.324 --> 00:21:04.827]  Old timers remember a time when things were a bit slower, and most folks really did take the time to stop and smell the roses.
[00:21:05.087 --> 00:21:10.650]  That was back when gardeners grew tomatoes that tasted like tomato, and watermelons that tasted like watermelon was supposed to.
[00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:13.211]  Sweet corn that was real sweet sweet corn.
[00:21:13.371 --> 00:21:14.411]  Well, you get the idea.
[00:21:14.572 --> 00:21:19.474]  Too bad the big seed companies became big greed companies and decided that hybrids grown in hothouses
[00:21:19.734 --> 00:21:24.497]  Artificially ripened with gas could be grown much quicker fetching more money at the large grocery stores.
[00:21:24.797 --> 00:21:34.283]  Folks at the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company remember that simpler time and are proud to be offering non-GMO heirloom seeds to gardeners who value flavor and variety over speed and greed.
[00:21:34.483 --> 00:21:43.569]  There's seed for fruits and vegetables of all kinds, seed for flowers and herbs, annuals and perennials, and some great books written by experts in the field to help get you started on the road to success.

[00:22:00.069 --> 00:22:02.290]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:07.071]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[00:22:07.351 --> 00:22:13.153]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[00:22:13.373 --> 00:22:17.435]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[00:22:17.715 --> 00:22:23.357]  However, they have become the elite group more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[00:22:23.477 --> 00:22:26.097]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[00:22:28.058 --> 00:22:28.718]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:22:28.738 --> 00:22:28.938]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:28.958 --> 00:22:29.219]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:58.399 --> 00:23:03.921]  Whether you live in the country or simply dream about living in the country, Countryside and Small Stock Journal is the magazine for you.

[00:23:43.176 --> 00:23:47.858]  If you decide it's not for you, simply write cancel on the invoice, but keep the magazine just for taking a look.
[00:23:47.978 --> 00:23:48.558]  I won't back down.
[00:23:48.578 --> 00:23:49.119]  I can't back down.
[00:24:17.589 --> 00:24:18.889]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:21.330]  You know, I know what's right.
[00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:23.670]  I got just one life, my friends, and so do you.
[00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:29.531]  Stand up against evil, be in the game, get off the bench, be part of history on the side of decency.
[00:24:30.351 --> 00:24:42.813]  We'll take calls, then I'll get into more of the top headlines coming up in the next segment after some calls, and I'll air that presidential phone call discussion with Richard Nixon from his presidential library where he talks about Bohemian Grove.
[00:24:43.434 --> 00:24:44.294]  Bud in Texas.
[00:24:44.374 --> 00:24:45.194]  Bud, you're on the air.
[00:24:45.234 --> 00:24:45.594]  Go ahead.
[00:24:46.468 --> 00:24:48.570]  Hey Alex, you do a heck of a job.
[00:24:49.110 --> 00:25:12.451]  And I would, immigration or illegal immigration or whatever is my hot button issue, and I'd love to tell everybody about the East Austin, largely Mexican neighborhood that I live in, and what they can expect, but in the interest of brevity, I was wondering if you could tell me what an administrative judge does, and because...
[00:25:13.157 --> 00:25:23.959]  I have a problem with a criminal that I believe is protected, and I want to know how much danger I might be in by taking action.
[00:25:24.719 --> 00:25:29.640]  Well, that's probably not enough info for me to come up with an answer for you.
[00:25:30.621 --> 00:25:34.421]  Let's go back to the immigration issue.
[00:25:34.521 --> 00:25:37.542]  Are there masses of illegals in your neighborhood?
[00:25:38.294 --> 00:25:38.654]  Oh, yeah.
[00:25:39.055 --> 00:25:39.875]  Well, I mean, sure.
[00:25:40.076 --> 00:25:49.003]  I mean, when I call PD, for instance, to say, you know, ask for parking enforcement because they like to park on the sidewalk, you know, I don't know if that's just the way they do things.
[00:25:49.583 --> 00:25:53.846]  But, you know, and I'm calling off a plate number, they're like, you know, that's too many numbers.
[00:25:54.347 --> 00:25:57.289]  No, this one's from, you know, MichioKon or whatever, you know.
[00:25:57.810 --> 00:25:58.230]  I mean, there's...
[00:25:59.259 --> 00:26:01.240]  Ah, the park nearby.
[00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.261]  You know, I walked the dog up there.
[00:26:02.281 --> 00:26:19.310]  Yeah, this is the frustration, is that as citizens, whether we're Hispanic or black or white or polka-dotted, we're under all these new rules, all this oppression, but foreigners, whether it be from Mexico or Russia, we always talk about Mexico because that's the majority, have more rights than citizens, get more tuition, more welfare.
[00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:21.191]  It's designed that way.
[00:26:21.761 --> 00:26:22.422]  Sure.
[00:26:22.462 --> 00:26:29.907]  But getting back to administrative judges and administrative courts, I don't know which administrative court you're talking about, but a lot of these are over color of law.
[00:26:29.967 --> 00:26:40.576]  Government just creates new jurisdictions, new bodies, and then they go out and engage in quasi-governmental activities, and the Constitution's null and void in their courts.
[00:26:40.616 --> 00:26:47.281]  Well, I guess what I'm seeing is all the functionaries, like PD, power company, legal aid,
[00:26:47.951 --> 00:26:51.858]  You know, they're all like, you know, well, this guy's crooked, you know, be careful with him.
[00:26:52.338 --> 00:26:55.884]  You know, but yet, you know, you've got drugs.
[00:26:56.485 --> 00:26:58.288]  That's the problem with a corrupt society.
[00:26:58.308 --> 00:26:59.570]  This happened in Nazi Germany.
[00:27:00.214 --> 00:27:03.397]  Well, I guess my question is... Let me just go over this, since you bring it up.
[00:27:03.857 --> 00:27:16.409]  This is what happens in a corrupt society, is that you've got the big criminals, and then all their minion criminals, and they protect them, and then they just start feeding on people, and then it becomes a third world system, and then why should anybody work hard?
[00:27:16.449 --> 00:27:21.173]  Because somebody will just take it from you, and then everybody just gets lazy, and then we stop progressing.
[00:27:21.874 --> 00:27:24.976]  Apathy is a terrible thing, yeah, you're right.
[00:27:25.537 --> 00:27:26.518]  Finish up real quick here.
[00:27:27.071 --> 00:27:39.739]  Okay, so I'm just trying to discern whether going to the FBI is a wrong move, because obviously... You know, occasionally going to the FBI is not a bad thing.
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:46.364]  I went to the FBI about eight years ago when I had a satanic cult after me.
[00:27:46.404 --> 00:27:47.905]  This even ended up in the newspaper.
[00:27:48.607 --> 00:27:49.187]  We're good to go.
[00:28:10.519 --> 00:28:17.961]  Then it's the counterterrorism divisions that are the criminals, so it's kind of a separation of division of labor there.
[00:28:18.542 --> 00:28:21.322]  But, yeah, I mean, sometimes the FBI really will do something.
[00:28:21.362 --> 00:28:21.903]  Thanks for the call.
[00:28:22.483 --> 00:28:23.963]  I appreciate that call.
[00:28:24.643 --> 00:28:27.844]  Let's talk to Emo, I believe, in Pennsylvania.
[00:28:27.884 --> 00:28:28.305]  Go ahead.
[00:28:28.325 --> 00:28:30.085]  Hi, Alex.
[00:28:30.645 --> 00:28:31.786]  I wanted to call you.
[00:28:31.806 --> 00:28:32.906]  I haven't called in a long time.
[00:28:33.697 --> 00:28:35.278]  I tell you, I really appreciate what you're doing.
[00:28:35.698 --> 00:28:38.679]  It takes a lot of fortitude to do what you're doing.
[00:28:38.919 --> 00:28:40.500]  Well, thank you, but I'm just doing my duty.
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:41.020]  Go ahead.
[00:28:41.641 --> 00:28:50.204]  I wanted to call and ask you, I sent you an email in reference to some things that's flying around about NASARA, N-E-S-A-R-A dot U-S.
[00:28:50.244 --> 00:28:52.025]  Yeah, it's not real.
[00:28:52.045 --> 00:28:52.705]  Okay.
[00:28:52.946 --> 00:28:54.426]  It's government disinfo.
[00:28:54.446 --> 00:28:58.228]  You know, the government secretly is good, and never mind the Patriot Act.
[00:28:58.528 --> 00:29:00.129]  Everything's about to be perfect.
[00:29:00.429 --> 00:29:02.370]  I just lay down and everything's fine.
[00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:02.750]  Right.
[00:29:03.948 --> 00:29:04.709]  It's not true.
[00:29:05.209 --> 00:29:05.749]  It's a fraud.
[00:29:06.129 --> 00:29:06.410]  Right.
[00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:12.132]  That's what I thought because after I was reading into this, I was like, wait a minute, something's not right here.
[00:29:12.153 --> 00:29:19.976]  There's a magical secret law they passed and the government's going to give you all your rights back and the New World Order was defeated and just go back to sleep.
[00:29:19.996 --> 00:29:20.877]  It's total garbage.
[00:29:20.897 --> 00:29:21.037]  Right.
[00:29:23.536 --> 00:29:25.017]  And I brought that Bertie light, too.
[00:29:25.037 --> 00:29:27.218]  That's awesome, that product that you're selling.
[00:29:27.238 --> 00:29:27.799]  That's amazing.
[00:29:28.079 --> 00:29:28.839]  Well, good job.
[00:29:28.879 --> 00:29:29.800]  Stop drinking the poison.
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:30.920]  You've done that, and good job.
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:31.401]  Hey, man.
[00:29:31.821 --> 00:29:32.841]  I had another question for you.
[00:29:32.901 --> 00:29:34.042]  I'm wondering if I could get to it.
[00:29:34.062 --> 00:29:34.863]  Go ahead and throw it out.
[00:29:34.903 --> 00:29:35.863]  I'll answer it after the break.
[00:29:35.983 --> 00:29:39.545]  Okay, about what are we supposed to do, like, with the driver's license and stuff like that?
[00:29:39.565 --> 00:29:41.226]  A lot of us are standing up and sending them back.
[00:29:41.306 --> 00:29:42.987]  What should we do now that we did that?
[00:29:43.027 --> 00:29:46.509]  Okay, what do we do about the biometric national ID card known as the driver's license?
[00:29:46.629 --> 00:29:48.450]  We'll be back to answer that question.
[00:29:49.591 --> 00:29:50.532]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.972 --> 00:29:52.493]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.503 --> 00:29:56.177]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.289 --> 00:30:07.552]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:30:07.812 --> 00:30:12.173]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:30:12.454 --> 00:30:21.377]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:30:21.577 --> 00:30:25.218]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:30:25.498 --> 00:30:30.525]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:30:30.825 --> 00:30:37.534]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:30:38.024 --> 00:30:38.685]  What about you?
[00:30:39.325 --> 00:30:44.689]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:30:44.749 --> 00:30:45.769]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:47.811]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:30:58.858 --> 00:31:00.378]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:31:00.538 --> 00:31:01.659]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:31:01.859 --> 00:31:05.260]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:05.780]  Phenol?
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:13.221]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:31:13.522 --> 00:31:17.622]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:31:17.743 --> 00:31:18.203]  Fragrance?
[00:31:18.563 --> 00:31:23.324]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:31:23.464 --> 00:31:28.065]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:31:28.365 --> 00:31:30.927]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[00:31:31.187 --> 00:31:34.589]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:31:34.749 --> 00:31:38.312]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:31:38.492 --> 00:31:40.893]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:31:41.013 --> 00:31:41.894]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:31:59.005 --> 00:32:00.026]  Are you losing your hair?
[00:32:00.366 --> 00:32:01.786]  Is that bald spot getting bigger?
[00:32:02.107 --> 00:32:03.227]  Is your hair looking thinner?
[00:32:03.787 --> 00:32:10.130]  Why aren't you using Avacor, the hair growth treatment that has helped thousands of people just like you regrow their hair?
[00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:11.951]  I am 39 years old.
[00:32:12.231 --> 00:32:14.552]  I've been slowly balding over the last 10 years.
[00:32:14.692 --> 00:32:18.093]  Thanks to Avacor, my hair is coming back and I couldn't be more excited.
[00:32:18.113 --> 00:32:19.854]  The best product that I've tried.
[00:32:20.034 --> 00:32:22.035]  Avacor is the product of the 21st century.

[00:32:37.802 --> 00:32:39.023]  Regrow your hair with Avacor.
[00:32:39.043 --> 00:32:39.243]  Call 800-397-7234.
[00:32:39.363 --> 00:32:40.044]  Order Avacor today.
[00:33:15.768 --> 00:33:20.910]  Coming up, Tom Flacco, investigative journalist, writes for World Net Daily, Newsmax, you name it.
[00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:27.331]  He's been there since day one at the two different whitewash commissions in Congress, at Congress.
[00:33:28.664 --> 00:33:33.868]  And a bunch of new big smoking gun developments, cover-ups of prior knowledge, you name it.
[00:33:33.888 --> 00:33:36.129]  We'll talk about that from an eyewitness to all of this.
[00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:46.837]  Coming up in the next hour, then in the third hour, Bob Chapman, economist, former Army intelligence, to talk about the plunging dollar, the economy, his take on the Madrid bombings, and much more.
[00:33:46.857 --> 00:33:49.379]  Of course, more of your calls coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:50.817 --> 00:33:57.543]  A caller in Pennsylvania was just bringing up the driver's license, the biometric driver's license, federally funded, going in in almost every state.
[00:33:57.943 --> 00:33:59.024]  He said, what do you do about it?
[00:33:59.975 --> 00:34:06.318]  Well, in 97, I went in and protested and got arrested at the DPS with about 100 protesters here in Austin.
[00:34:06.818 --> 00:34:10.400]  And I put it at the end of my first film, America Destroyed by Design.
[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:15.002]  The last 20 minutes is the protest and my arrest and what the biometric plan is.
[00:34:15.042 --> 00:34:22.865]  Now you can see everything I claimed in that film coming true in the grocery stores and the theme parks and the school buses and the public schools.
[00:34:22.945 --> 00:34:24.686]  No food allowed without thumb scanning.
[00:34:24.726 --> 00:34:25.587]  No cash allowed.
[00:34:26.887 --> 00:34:27.788]  He asked, what do you do?
[00:34:27.808 --> 00:34:28.428]  I mean...
[00:34:29.668 --> 00:34:39.832]  It's like living in Russia and going, well, a national ID card is wrong, but if you're going to be fighting it, you've got to have the national ID card, I guess, to go about your business in the country fighting the tyranny.
[00:34:41.073 --> 00:34:48.596]  And so about a year ago, before 9-11, I could still get on planes with my old driver's license or passport, but now without it, you can't get on planes.
[00:34:50.357 --> 00:34:53.078]  And so I said, well, will I stop flying places?
[00:34:53.118 --> 00:34:54.218]  Will I not fly to L.A.
[00:34:54.238 --> 00:34:55.579]  to go on national television?
[00:34:56.808 --> 00:34:59.490]  Or why not fly to Florida to expose corruption?
[00:35:00.011 --> 00:35:02.993]  So I went and thumb scanned and got the driver's license.
[00:35:03.013 --> 00:35:05.555]  My point was exposing what this system is.
[00:35:05.575 --> 00:35:09.599]  You need to get people behind a movement to repeal this and not go along with it.
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.221]  So it's up to you what you're going to do.
[00:35:12.301 --> 00:35:14.082]  But it's very, very serious.
[00:35:16.004 --> 00:35:19.026]  It's a federal program of total control to track everything you do.
[00:35:20.047 --> 00:35:21.088]  And they're going to move towards...
[00:35:22.027 --> 00:35:26.844]  Making you swipe your ID card, your driver's license, which is your national ID card, in your face.
[00:35:27.429 --> 00:35:30.951]  When you buy anything, because that will be part of the new national sales tax.
[00:35:30.991 --> 00:35:35.474]  They're getting you ready for this if you buy cold medicine or cigarettes or beer.
[00:35:35.594 --> 00:35:36.955]  Oh, we've got to swipe your card.
[00:35:36.995 --> 00:35:42.358]  Many states do this just to make sure that you're as old as you say you are.
[00:35:42.798 --> 00:35:46.020]  Or because you're buying cold medicine, it could be for making drugs.
[00:35:46.481 --> 00:35:49.643]  So they're preparing you for this, and now the thumb scanners are going in.
[00:35:49.663 --> 00:35:54.806]  They're getting rid of the people at the checkout counters, and then the thumb scanners go in after the self-checkout goes in.
[00:35:56.044 --> 00:35:57.525]  This is all part of the program of control.
[00:36:26.528 --> 00:36:39.715]  In one of their recorded conversations there at the White House, how he hates Bohemian Grove, how he's been there, and how it's, quote, the most faggy, bleep-bleep thing, place he's ever been.
[00:36:40.656 --> 00:36:46.238]  And I pointed this out in the film and on the air because everybody that went there didn't love it.
[00:36:46.298 --> 00:36:50.901]  Ronald Reagan said he didn't like it in recorded transmissions.
[00:36:52.511 --> 00:36:56.604]  Nixon said it, but the point is they had to go there to be part of the power structure.
[00:36:56.644 --> 00:36:58.469]  They had to be there when they did the rituals.
[00:36:58.509 --> 00:36:59.773]  They had to do all of this.
[00:37:02.388 --> 00:37:06.991]  And, you know, the Washington Times reports, you know, how they run around naked in the woods.
[00:37:07.031 --> 00:37:07.831]  That's the Washington Times.
[00:37:07.871 --> 00:37:08.512]  It's in my film.
[00:37:08.832 --> 00:37:17.757]  The first 20 minutes of the film is just news articles and documents and autobiographies of prime ministers and chancellors and people talking about the rituals, talking about what goes on.
[00:37:18.438 --> 00:37:22.180]  Major publications have reported they bust in the male and female prostitutes for them.
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.442]  And the point is, this is all off-limits.
[00:37:24.462 --> 00:37:28.344]  We're just not supposed to discuss how our Christian conservative leaders supposedly...
[00:37:29.096 --> 00:37:29.916]  Are attending this.
[00:37:29.956 --> 00:37:44.919]  And I have photos from their own annals, from the 86 to 96 annals, posted on Infowars.com, of George Bush and his son, the current president, there at the Grove.
[00:37:44.959 --> 00:37:48.940]  What, in 1993, the two of them, they're giving a speech beneath the owl.
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:50.261]  This is a real place.
[00:37:50.321 --> 00:37:51.041]  It's been in the news.
[00:37:51.201 --> 00:37:52.141]  I got the footage of this.
[00:37:52.661 --> 00:37:57.002]  Now, this audio clip, when you listen to it online, these presidential tapes are already bad enough.
[00:38:00.104 --> 00:38:02.645]  You can clearly hear it online.
[00:38:03.205 --> 00:38:06.526]  We tried to clean up the clip a little bit, but you really got a strain to hear what he's saying.
[00:38:07.346 --> 00:38:17.631]  We bleeped out some of Nixon's profanities here, but you can listen to the clip unedited at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:38:17.671 --> 00:38:19.071]  Go ahead and hit that clip, Stephanie.
[00:38:19.871 --> 00:38:21.992]  Let's look at North Carolina.
[00:38:22.112 --> 00:38:23.353]  You understand?
[00:38:23.973 --> 00:38:24.693]  Yeah.
[00:38:24.773 --> 00:38:26.394]  San Francisco is just gone.
[00:38:26.474 --> 00:38:28.435]  It's clear over there, but it isn't
[00:38:29.235 --> 00:38:31.676]  It's a different set of values.
[00:39:00.487 --> 00:39:05.891]  Okay, and sometimes when you take an audio clip and try to clean it up, it makes that weird computer noise in the background.
[00:39:06.352 --> 00:39:10.015]  Stephanie, try to open that up off the website and just play it raw.
[00:39:10.895 --> 00:39:12.657]  But, I mean, he says GD.
[00:39:12.957 --> 00:39:14.178]  I consider that profanity.
[00:39:14.298 --> 00:39:15.099]  I don't use that.
[00:39:15.999 --> 00:39:16.200]  But...
[00:39:17.355 --> 00:39:23.078]  When he says it's the most faggy, then right there, pause, you know, fade the audio down for about a second or two.
[00:39:23.679 --> 00:39:26.140]  I mean, they use this on Rush Limbaugh Show and everywhere else.
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:30.503]  We try to have higher standards, but somehow, you know, Stephanie, you said that clip's better now.
[00:39:30.523 --> 00:39:33.845]  It sounds worse, because online you can really hear what they're saying.
[00:39:34.746 --> 00:39:36.346]  But I'll tell you what.
[00:39:36.386 --> 00:39:39.528]  How about you try to record it onto the computer again, Stephanie?
[00:39:39.568 --> 00:39:41.249]  Here I am giving him instructions live on air.
[00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:45.712]  And how about you record it on the computer and just not clean it up?
[00:39:45.752 --> 00:39:47.033]  Because somehow I think the cleaning it up
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:52.644]  Somehow put that computerized, heterodyne noise on it, which seems to happen.
[00:39:52.664 --> 00:39:59.589]  But again, off the presidential website, it's horrible enough, and then we put it on our site, and then we transfer it here.
[00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:02.131]  It's an important piece of evidence, though.
[00:40:02.151 --> 00:40:03.692]  I don't know if you could make out what he was saying.
[00:40:03.712 --> 00:40:05.053]  I mean, I could make out some of it.
[00:40:05.913 --> 00:40:12.398]  But later in the show, we'll try to play it raw without trying to clean it up, and maybe it'll be easier to hear.
[00:40:13.659 --> 00:40:14.560]  All right, let's...
[00:40:15.512 --> 00:40:16.973]  Let's go ahead and take some more calls.
[00:40:16.993 --> 00:40:19.294]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Texas.
[00:40:19.654 --> 00:40:20.434]  John, go ahead.
[00:40:20.995 --> 00:40:21.815]  God bless you, Alex.
[00:40:21.875 --> 00:40:22.976]  I'm going to try to be real brief.
[00:40:22.996 --> 00:40:23.876]  Well, let me ask you a question.
[00:40:23.896 --> 00:40:25.237]  Could you hear what Nixon was saying?
[00:40:26.097 --> 00:40:27.378]  Sir, I couldn't understand it.
[00:40:27.658 --> 00:40:30.399]  I was listening to it over the phone, and I couldn't hear what he was saying.
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:35.342]  Well, you can clearly hear it online, so I guess, but go ahead.
[00:40:36.082 --> 00:40:39.324]  Anyway, I wanted to bring up two points I think you'll have an opinion on.
[00:40:39.364 --> 00:40:41.325]  I'll be real brief because I know other people are waiting.
[00:40:41.929 --> 00:40:49.912]  First one is, as you know, the globalists are putting, quote unquote, the protection of intellectual property as one of their big priorities.
[00:40:50.372 --> 00:41:01.255]  And I sent you an email about Reuters now saying that they're going to be searching the internet for looking for anybody that's using any of their material, even if normally it'd be fair use, and going after them for copyright infringement.
[00:41:01.756 --> 00:41:05.777]  The second point I wanted to bring up that I haven't heard you talk about was
[00:41:06.721 --> 00:41:07.281]  Well, thank you.
[00:41:07.321 --> 00:41:08.982]  I hope somebody will send me...
[00:41:32.907 --> 00:41:34.568]  The video of that that was on C-SPAN.
[00:41:34.688 --> 00:41:35.329]  I didn't see it.
[00:41:35.849 --> 00:41:36.990]  I have the article here.
[00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:41.873]  I mean, it's not half as bad as the stuff he said to Ozzy Osbourne.
[00:41:41.893 --> 00:41:51.039]  You know, blood and hell and death and Sabbath, bloody Sabbath, and Bush laughing and cackling, because they do stuff a lot more radical than that, at Skull and Bones.
[00:41:51.059 --> 00:42:00.185]  You know, getting in the coffins, doing all the bizarre, dark, Masonic stuff that, well, we saw develop, unfortunately, out in Long Island just a few weeks ago.
[00:42:01.366 --> 00:42:02.707]  So I don't know what to say about it.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:13.513]  Alex, what do you think about the Reuters thing about them going to be using that FASD search engine looking for anybody that's using any of their material that they haven't given their previous blessing to?
[00:42:13.793 --> 00:42:15.635]  Well, I mean, this is all just fear-mongering.
[00:42:15.735 --> 00:42:17.698]  The Internet is damaging the globalists.
[00:42:18.514 --> 00:42:24.839]  And so it starts out with people that are ripping off music off the Internet, which I've never done because I don't listen to a lot of music.
[00:42:25.679 --> 00:42:27.420]  And then, oh, we've got to do this.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.921]  First it's Napster, then it's that.
[00:42:29.522 --> 00:42:31.183]  And now, oh, we want to go after everything.
[00:42:31.703 --> 00:42:38.568]  And so they go and arrest a bunch of old ladies and people because their grandchildren use their computers, or they don't arrest them, they sue them.
[00:42:38.848 --> 00:42:39.949]  It's all fear-mongering.
[00:42:40.189 --> 00:42:42.871]  There's billions of people online now, over a billion.
[00:42:43.211 --> 00:42:44.272]  There's nothing they can do.
[00:42:44.372 --> 00:42:47.074]  It's selective enforcement to try to scare people.
[00:42:47.154 --> 00:42:47.815]  It's civil.
[00:42:48.756 --> 00:42:49.897]  So it's a bunch of propaganda.
[00:42:49.937 --> 00:42:50.577]  Thank you for the call.
[00:42:50.617 --> 00:42:51.858]  I appreciate the call, John.
[00:42:52.679 --> 00:42:54.440]  Let's go ahead and talk to Don.
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:56.261]  And Don, where are you calling us from?
[00:42:57.022 --> 00:42:58.363]  Raleigh, North Carolina, Alex.
[00:42:58.563 --> 00:42:59.124]  Welcome, sir.
[00:42:59.384 --> 00:43:00.344]  Pleasure to speak with you.
[00:43:01.625 --> 00:43:08.771]  On behalf of every American who cherishes freedom, liberty, and privacy, I want to thank you for doing your duty.
[00:43:09.127 --> 00:43:10.128]  Thank you.
[00:43:10.468 --> 00:43:15.752]  You've helped to inspire me to have the courage to try to wake up those around me to this evil that's going on around us.
[00:43:17.613 --> 00:43:27.480]  What I'm calling today about is I wanted to alert the people in my area, especially here in North Carolina, that pay attention to what's going on in the sky.
[00:43:29.341 --> 00:43:38.347]  And I don't know if this relates to what you were talking about earlier with the vaccines and who knows what they're spraying with these contrails, but
[00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:58.261]  I ventured outside of my area this morning, about 45 miles south of Raleigh, which gets you out in the country, and looked up in the sky, and it's a beautiful spring day, blue sky, very few clouds, and I saw a couple of jets going across the sky, and the contrails that they were leaving were minuscule.
[00:43:58.641 --> 00:43:59.942]  They did not persist.
[00:44:00.322 --> 00:44:03.884]  They evaporated and went away within a minute.
[00:44:04.085 --> 00:44:05.325]  Yeah, that's a real contrail.
[00:44:05.785 --> 00:44:06.946]  That's a real contrail.
[00:44:08.877 --> 00:44:11.278]  You know, contrails don't form at 4,000 feet.
[00:44:11.418 --> 00:44:11.878]  Right.
[00:44:12.198 --> 00:44:18.141]  But basically now, in the middle of the summer, the winter, it doesn't matter, they do here, and they sit there for four or five hours.
[00:44:18.461 --> 00:44:19.922]  That's not a condensation trail.
[00:44:20.082 --> 00:44:20.582]  That's right.
[00:44:20.602 --> 00:44:37.829]  Well, when I returned home, which is in a suburb of Raleigh, North Carolina, this morning, around 11 o'clock or so, they just looked up into the sky, and the sky was crisscrossed with contrails, new ones, jets crossing our area.
[00:44:38.735 --> 00:44:46.919]  Billowing out white, very brilliant-looking vapor that persists.
[00:44:47.519 --> 00:44:56.083]  And anyone that goes outside here right now can look up in the sky and probably see 10 or 15 of these things and the cloud banks that have formed and expanded.
[00:44:56.423 --> 00:45:01.385]  What it reminds me of, I grew up on a farm here, and I used to put chemicals in water.
[00:45:01.925 --> 00:45:07.708]  And some of the ways that these clouds are dispersing reminds me of the way chemicals disperse in water.
[00:45:08.852 --> 00:45:15.474]  And it certainly makes me very concerned about what they're spraying over us.
[00:45:15.494 --> 00:45:19.556]  Listen, Harry and I appreciate the call, Don, there in Carolina.
[00:45:19.616 --> 00:45:25.158]  Look, I just read an admitted official report that the U.N.
[00:45:25.198 --> 00:45:27.638]  puts hormones in vaccines that sterilize women.
[00:45:28.779 --> 00:45:30.239]  If they'll do that, they'll do anything.
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:32.400]  They cannot be trusted.
[00:45:33.192 --> 00:45:34.852]  Let's talk to Kevin in Pennsylvania.
[00:45:34.872 --> 00:45:35.613]  Kevin, go ahead.
[00:45:35.873 --> 00:45:42.414]  Hey, I called in a local talk show, Michael Smirconish, and they were talking about the 911 Commission.
[00:45:42.654 --> 00:45:49.076]  I might have sounded a little crazy when I called in, but I said that it's all problem, reaction, solution.
[00:45:49.576 --> 00:45:50.356]  It's a whitewash.
[00:45:50.416 --> 00:45:51.996]  The government did 911.
[00:45:52.596 --> 00:45:55.037]  It took scarce in the submission.
[00:45:55.057 --> 00:45:59.438]  One thing I did say a couple times is that
[00:46:00.866 --> 00:46:06.411]  Homeland Security and the Patriot Act are aimed at American citizens, and I gave your name and your website.
[00:46:07.351 --> 00:46:12.515]  Did you notice, would you happen to notice a jump in hits on your website around?
[00:46:12.956 --> 00:46:29.729]  Well, I hate to sound braggish, but, I mean, sir, we get millions and millions of individual visitors every week now to the site, so I, no, I didn't... There's a whole Philadelphia area here that was listening at that time to that station, you know,
[00:46:31.608 --> 00:46:34.311]  I heard me call in.
[00:46:34.451 --> 00:46:35.111]  Well, good job.
[00:46:35.191 --> 00:46:43.659]  No, I mean, that's certainly why we get millions of visitors is because people like you call into C-SPAN and call into Sean Hannity and call into all these shows.
[00:46:43.959 --> 00:46:44.079]  And I...
[00:46:47.325 --> 00:46:53.368]  Does that make them angry, by the way, if you call into a normal talk show and give out, you know, say stuff like that, like the government did it?
[00:46:53.608 --> 00:46:55.789]  No, I mean, it makes some shows mad.
[00:46:55.869 --> 00:46:59.571]  Other shows like it because they think it's entertaining, it's interesting.
[00:47:00.311 --> 00:47:02.132]  But, I mean, who cares what they think?
[00:47:02.665 --> 00:47:09.251]  Yeah, but that's why the screener asked what you were going to say, because if you told the screener that, then they wouldn't let you on.
[00:47:09.291 --> 00:47:09.851]  Well, that's it.
[00:47:09.871 --> 00:47:17.578]  I mean, look, the quickest way to get on a neocon show is call up and say you're a liberal, act really stupid, and they'll get you on instantly.
[00:47:17.918 --> 00:47:21.441]  If you call up and say I'm a conservative and Bush isn't a conservative, you're not going to get on the air.
[00:47:21.962 --> 00:47:22.282]  Yeah.
[00:47:22.302 --> 00:47:24.404]  Well, it's all controlled.
[00:47:24.504 --> 00:47:25.565]  Well, in some areas it is.
[00:47:25.585 --> 00:47:29.608]  There are a lot of talk shows that aren't controlled, but there's not a lot of big syndicated ones that aren't.
[00:47:29.628 --> 00:47:30.289]  This one's like a...
[00:47:30.802 --> 00:47:42.385]  This one's a local show that's very popular, but I know that... See, I had to talk fast, because if I just talk normally, he's going to cut me off before I make any good points.
[00:47:42.525 --> 00:47:43.686]  Yeah.
[00:47:43.726 --> 00:47:45.186]  Before I say anything substantial.
[00:47:45.206 --> 00:47:47.687]  So what did he say after you were on the show?
[00:47:48.567 --> 00:47:54.269]  He was asking me, how do they do it?
[00:47:54.929 --> 00:47:58.350]  And it's like, I don't have anything in front of me, and I'm all...
[00:47:59.178 --> 00:48:00.839]  You know, I'm all hyper saying things.
[00:48:01.679 --> 00:48:02.680]  You don't have a lot of time.
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:05.281]  You say, look, we don't have time to get into all the details.
[00:48:05.921 --> 00:48:07.062]  You need to research it.
[00:48:07.642 --> 00:48:10.423]  And, you know, here's just a few case examples.
[00:48:10.963 --> 00:48:12.824]  The Bushes are in business with the Bin Ladens.
[00:48:12.864 --> 00:48:14.705]  They flew them out of the country on 9-11.
[00:48:15.405 --> 00:48:18.507]  They warned Mayor Willie Brown not to fly to New York that day.
[00:48:18.907 --> 00:48:21.288]  The CIA engaged in insider trading.
[00:48:21.868 --> 00:48:23.329]  Some of the hijackers were trained at U.S.
[00:48:23.369 --> 00:48:24.249]  military bases.
[00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:27.351]  Nine of the 19 hijackers have been found to still be alive.
[00:48:27.831 --> 00:48:32.392]  Just fire those out at them, and that's how you do it.
[00:48:32.512 --> 00:48:40.634]  I hope a couple people, at least, that heard me, you know, went up to your site and, you know, maybe... Well, good job.
[00:48:40.654 --> 00:48:42.094]  But I'll tell you another thing.
[00:48:42.154 --> 00:48:42.655]  Okay, Kevin.
[00:48:42.695 --> 00:48:50.196]  Just like you've been saying that, you know, years ago, like half the people would disagree with you, and now it's hard for you to find a caller that disagrees with you.
[00:48:50.516 --> 00:48:52.857]  People on the street now that I talk to...
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:57.841]  Only once in a while will I get somebody that will disagree.
[00:48:57.961 --> 00:49:00.702]  A lot of people that I talk to, they're like, yeah, you know what?
[00:49:00.722 --> 00:49:02.223]  It does look like the government did it.
[00:49:02.443 --> 00:49:02.823]  That's it.
[00:49:03.143 --> 00:49:03.863]  I appreciate the call.
[00:49:03.943 --> 00:49:05.824]  Everybody knows the truth, even their guts.
[00:49:06.044 --> 00:49:06.945]  They've got a soul.
[00:49:08.245 --> 00:49:12.947]  Now, the wicked of the world are blind, but yes, sir, yes, sir.
[00:49:12.987 --> 00:49:13.767]  That's what we've seen.
[00:49:13.827 --> 00:49:16.228]  It's very encouraging to hear that from you.
[00:49:16.248 --> 00:49:16.528]  Thank you.
[00:49:17.408 --> 00:49:17.749]  We'll break.
[00:49:17.769 --> 00:49:20.750]  I'm going to come back, get some news, and then we've got a guest coming up.
[00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:22.530]  We'll go to your calls early in the next hour.
[00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:24.191]  Before I end this segment, though...
[00:49:25.473 --> 00:49:31.698]  Be sure and visit Infowars.com or presentplanet.com.

[00:49:41.385 --> 00:49:43.286]  The power we have is through you.
[00:49:43.306 --> 00:49:44.607]  So don't thank me.
[00:49:44.627 --> 00:49:45.488]  I want to thank you.
[00:49:46.491 --> 00:49:48.612]  I want to thank those that have gotten the videos and made copies.

[00:51:11.197 --> 00:51:16.460]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:20.902]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:51:21.082 --> 00:51:24.864]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:51:25.124 --> 00:51:29.707]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:51:29.827 --> 00:51:36.092]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:51:36.132 --> 00:51:38.014]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:51:59.102 --> 00:52:05.344]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:52:05.484 --> 00:52:11.647]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:52:11.927 --> 00:52:20.370]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:27.633]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:52:27.933 --> 00:52:32.756]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:52:32.976 --> 00:52:38.360]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:41.802]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.

[00:54:04.297 --> 00:54:06.217]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:54:06.677 --> 00:54:09.418]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:12.817 --> 00:54:14.440]  All right, we'll cover some more news.
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:20.067]  And we've got Tom Flock, our investigative journalist, who's been there at the whitewash hearings covering it, joining us.
[00:54:20.087 --> 00:54:23.251]  And we'll take more of your calls into the next hour.
[00:54:23.271 --> 00:54:23.331]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:29.577 --> 00:54:32.798]  Kind of got rushed there at the end of the last segment.
[00:54:33.218 --> 00:54:40.281]  Again, it is so important that when we have videos that are waking up 90% of those that see them, you need to take action.
[00:54:40.321 --> 00:54:47.964]  If you already own my films, make some copies, donate them to the library, give them to your county commissioners, you know, whatever.
[00:54:48.845 --> 00:54:52.766]  Just your city council, the local talk show host, your pastor.
[00:54:54.087 --> 00:54:55.087]  Take action.
[00:54:55.127 --> 00:54:56.828]  If you haven't gotten the films, get them.
[00:54:57.675 --> 00:55:02.577]  1-888-253-3139 or InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or write to me at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:55:02.697 --> 00:55:02.897]  Okay.
[00:55:02.957 --> 00:55:03.738]  And the videos are $25.95 apiece.
[00:55:03.818 --> 00:55:06.019]  If you order three or more, they drop down to $20.
[00:55:06.059 --> 00:55:06.499]  My book's $12.
[00:55:06.539 --> 00:55:08.820]  Watson's book's $19.95.
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:11.902]  I carry a bunch of other videos and books as well.
[00:55:25.333 --> 00:55:26.174]  Back into the news.
[00:55:26.274 --> 00:55:29.777]  China says it won't sit by if Taiwan turmoil worsens.
[00:55:29.897 --> 00:55:41.766]  Reuters reports that China, in its strongest statement yet on the political crisis, convulsing Taiwan since its controversial election, warned on Friday it would not stand idly by if the situation on the island spirals out of control.
[00:55:41.867 --> 00:55:49.533]  Quote, We will not sit by watching should the post-election situation in Taiwan get out of control, leading to social turmoil.
[00:55:50.370 --> 00:55:56.656]  Endangering the lives and property of our flesh-and-blood brothers and affecting stability across the Taiwan Strait.
[00:55:57.176 --> 00:56:02.881]  Yes, soon, Taiwan, you'll have mobile death vans for speaking out against the government, and your churches will be shut down.
[00:56:03.061 --> 00:56:06.144]  Soon, you'll be living under the UN award-winning country's control.
[00:56:06.965 --> 00:56:13.691]  Beijing's policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office said in a statement they will not sit idly by as their flesh and blood is hurt.
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:28.623]  It reiterated that China was paying close attention to events on the island, which had been wracked by protest political paralysis since President Xi Jinping, who favors Taiwan independence, won re-election by the thinnest of margins on Saturday.
[00:56:28.963 --> 00:56:32.464]  The opposition immediately contested the result and demanded a recount.
[00:56:34.324 --> 00:56:37.665]  But China's clearly trying to destabilize, and they may have really shot him.
[00:56:38.045 --> 00:56:39.545]  Some are saying now it's a staged shooting.
[00:56:39.565 --> 00:56:42.186]  I don't know, isn't that kind of what the commies do?
[00:56:43.147 --> 00:56:44.388]  Who knows, though?
[00:56:45.329 --> 00:56:48.231]  This is an interesting little tidbit here for you.
[00:56:48.271 --> 00:56:50.333]  Two bills now pending to bring back the draft.
[00:56:50.353 --> 00:56:53.696]  There's actually about nine of them, but these are two that have been out of committee now.
[00:56:55.778 --> 00:56:56.098]  H.R.
[00:56:56.118 --> 00:57:08.048]  163, this is from the bill, to provide for the common defense by requiring that all young persons in the United States, including women, perform a period of military service or a period of civilian service in the furtherance of the national defense and homeland security and for other purposes.
[00:57:08.749 --> 00:57:09.832]  We've read the other purposes.
[00:57:10.173 --> 00:57:16.649]  Tattletail squads, gun-grabbing squads, checkpoint squads, environmental land-grab squads, literally.
[00:57:17.493 --> 00:57:18.474]  Everybody has to serve.
[00:57:18.514 --> 00:57:20.375]  In some of the bills, it says 18 to 49.
[00:57:20.435 --> 00:57:34.663]  S-89 says to provide for the common defense by requiring that all young persons in the United States, including women, perform a period of military service or a period of civilian service in furtherance of the national defense and homeland security and for other purposes.
[00:57:34.983 --> 00:57:36.564]  So it'll be a new type of draft.
[00:57:36.624 --> 00:57:42.748]  Not where you join the military and go fight, but where you engage in secure corps and tips type programs.
[00:57:43.908 --> 00:57:44.829]  Pretty scary stuff.
[00:57:45.652 --> 00:57:48.034]  But again, we're in the new Stasi America.
[00:57:50.715 --> 00:57:53.937]  After the feds blow something else up, you better believe they're going to pass this.
[00:57:53.957 --> 00:57:54.758]  They've said they will.
[00:57:55.578 --> 00:57:56.959]  And I guess I'm going to be under it.
[00:57:57.300 --> 00:57:58.881]  I'm under 49 years of age.
[00:57:59.901 --> 00:58:06.526]  As you read into these bills, 49 is a young person, and I guess a lot of us will get arrested.
[00:58:06.546 --> 00:58:12.169]  We refuse to go tattle on neighbors, help run checkpoints, help do environmental tattletaling.
[00:58:12.229 --> 00:58:14.791]  I saw somebody leave a Coke can at the park.
[00:58:15.416 --> 00:58:17.438]  I mean, literally, that's what they say they're going to do.
[00:58:17.458 --> 00:58:23.103]  So imagine, you have to serve your ten hours a week in the Homeland Brigade.
[00:58:23.123 --> 00:58:30.489]  You have to volunteer your time, compulsory volunteerism, to watch the surveillance camera feeds from FEMA, the New York Times reported.
[00:58:31.129 --> 00:58:38.776]  So Orwellian, it is unspeakable to try to even describe the bone-chilling nature of it.
[00:58:39.392 --> 00:58:40.514]  Tom Flacco's up next.
[00:58:40.575 --> 00:58:41.316]  More of your calls.
[00:58:41.677 --> 00:58:43.741]  Tons of news in the second and third hours.
[00:58:44.162 --> 00:58:45.084]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:45.224 --> 00:58:46.226]  Stay with me.
[00:58:50.919 --> 00:58:51.359]  We're good to go.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:15.661]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:59:16.041 --> 00:59:16.541]  We listened.
[00:59:16.881 --> 00:59:22.103]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:59:22.523 --> 00:59:23.903]  Again, we listened.
[00:59:24.243 --> 00:59:31.625]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:59:32.025 --> 00:59:35.066]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259.99.
[00:59:41.525 --> 00:59:42.466]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:59:42.486 --> 00:59:43.926]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:00:02.506 --> 01:00:03.386]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:03.406 --> 01:00:07.688]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:08.248 --> 01:00:12.370]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.871 --> 01:00:17.951]  All right, my friends.
[01:00:18.052 --> 01:00:19.932]  He's written for World Net Daily.
[01:00:19.952 --> 01:00:27.735]  From the Wilderness Publications, Newsmax, Marco News, Judicial Watch.
[01:00:29.099 --> 01:00:29.599]  We're good to go.
[01:00:56.676 --> 01:00:58.756]  TomFlacco.com is the website.
[01:00:59.277 --> 01:01:03.398]  Also, unansweredquestions.org.
[01:01:03.518 --> 01:01:04.638]  Just done a lot of great work.
[01:01:04.838 --> 01:01:09.439]  And yesterday we covered an article he broke because the media didn't want to cover this.
[01:01:09.459 --> 01:01:12.660]  The lady was surrounded by cameras but didn't see it on the news.
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:18.081]  Breaking special report, 9-11 hearings, DOJ asked FBI translator to change pre-9-11 intercepts.
[01:01:20.071 --> 01:01:20.491]  We're good to go.
[01:01:42.869 --> 01:01:50.192]  And that links in with the ABC News article about Cheney in control of the bunkers that morning, even beforehand, a giant staged event.
[01:01:50.932 --> 01:01:52.933]  And Tom, good to have you on the show.
[01:01:54.714 --> 01:01:55.974]  I appreciate you joining us, Tom.
[01:01:56.214 --> 01:01:58.035]  I had a couple of very interesting days.
[01:01:58.075 --> 01:02:08.339]  I was down there for a press conference on Monday, and I spent the whole day Tuesday and Wednesday, and it was quite tiring, but we knew it was going to be a pretty exhilarating experience because of the,
[01:02:08.823 --> 01:02:12.206]  Just the people that were testifying that day.
[01:02:12.226 --> 01:02:19.051]  Well, I want to go over, because you've been there, I want to go over the past few years, a year and a half, down there watching all this.
[01:02:19.071 --> 01:02:26.016]  I want to go over the big smoking guns that haven't gotten reported and how the whitewash is progressing and where you think all this is going.
[01:02:27.097 --> 01:02:30.019]  Well, I'll tell you, I personally, and I'm going to write about this...
[01:02:30.743 --> 01:02:43.192]  I normally write a story that's geared toward one particular subject, but there were so many things that struck me in this hearing that I'm going to do a 9-11 shadow news, the stuff that doesn't come out of the shadows type of thing.
[01:02:44.293 --> 01:02:53.660]  I literally had personal contact with five of the ten commissioners, wherein I went and asked them, why are you failing to use your subpoena power?
[01:02:54.246 --> 01:02:56.608]  You know, and it's just incredible.
[01:02:56.648 --> 01:02:57.609]  They just look at you.
[01:02:57.629 --> 01:03:00.852]  And I say, you know, the hijacking started at 10 after 8.
[01:03:00.992 --> 01:03:01.953]  The plane turned south at 8.20.
[01:03:03.815 --> 01:03:05.336]  I'm just rattling stuff off.
[01:03:05.356 --> 01:03:10.140]  23 minutes after 8, Madeline Sweeney calls in and says, you know, we had maybe a possible gunshot.
[01:03:10.521 --> 01:03:12.142]  A stewardess got her throat slit.
[01:03:12.482 --> 01:03:14.704]  So we know that there's a hijacking going on at 10 after 20.
[01:03:14.804 --> 01:03:17.807]  We know there were phone bridges at 20, 25 after.
[01:03:18.147 --> 01:03:19.909]  We know that the President of the United States said,
[01:03:20.276 --> 01:03:29.180]  I know what's going on in New York City at 8.30 in the morning, and I'll have more of this before he stepped into his limousine to go to the elementary school, and said, you know, I know what's going on.
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:30.780]  And this is all admitted, by the way.
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:32.541]  Yes, all admitted, all reported by U.S.
[01:03:32.561 --> 01:03:33.762]  journalists, 8.35 and 8.30.
[01:03:34.382 --> 01:03:38.263]  We have an audio clip of Bush talking about seeing the first plane hit on television.
[01:03:38.664 --> 01:03:41.405]  Oh, yeah, that's... But nobody else has seen that.
[01:03:41.725 --> 01:03:44.146]  A lot of people don't realize, if you listen closely to the testimony...
[01:03:45.186 --> 01:03:47.848]  All American Airlines equipment was grounded at about 845.
[01:03:47.988 --> 01:03:50.129]  I've got to go check that because I've got that.
[01:03:50.409 --> 01:03:52.350]  I was taking notes and I've got to go back to my files.
[01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:53.711]  But in that area.
[01:03:53.931 --> 01:03:55.792]  So we're talking about a hijacking.
[01:03:56.153 --> 01:04:02.956]  The air traffic controller, the quote was, we determined to be a hijacking at 810 or 813 in the morning.
[01:04:02.976 --> 01:04:02.956]  813.
[01:04:03.557 --> 01:04:07.479]  So that's just about two hours before the last plane crashed.
[01:04:07.999 --> 01:04:11.361]  And it's about 30, 35 minutes before the first plane crashed.
[01:04:12.248 --> 01:04:16.132]  And so their actions, Alex, are indefensible.
[01:04:16.152 --> 01:04:17.073]  And I've been saying this.
[01:04:17.513 --> 01:04:20.957]  They're the actions of General Myers, who sat in his office.
[01:04:20.997 --> 01:04:23.599]  He was the head of NORAD that shut everything down.
[01:04:23.679 --> 01:04:26.782]  Now he got the chairmanship of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for his good work.
[01:04:27.143 --> 01:04:27.543]  Right.
[01:04:27.763 --> 01:04:31.106]  He was acting Joint Chiefs that day, the highest-ranking general on U.S.
[01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:32.368]  soil when...
[01:04:33.545 --> 01:04:39.273]  When the other fellow was Tommy Franks, not Tommy Franks, the other Joint Chiefs.
[01:04:39.313 --> 01:04:40.855]  Yeah, he was Joint Chiefs.
[01:04:40.916 --> 01:04:44.921]  When the other fellow was overseas, everybody was basically out of position.
[01:04:45.122 --> 01:04:45.883]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:04:45.903 --> 01:04:48.506]  We've got to come back and go over all this.
[01:04:48.547 --> 01:04:49.328]  Everybody stay with us.
[01:04:51.869 --> 01:04:56.530]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the first ever half-price package sale at the Ark Institute.
[01:04:56.630 --> 01:05:03.532]  You'll get 25 big packets of Ark's most popular non-hybrid heirloom vegetable seeds plus four of their most popular self-reliance books.
[01:05:03.732 --> 01:05:06.253]  Learn how to grow your own delicious veggies and build your Ark.
[01:05:06.493 --> 01:05:11.635]  Imagine green beans, carrots, peas, and cucumbers, tomatoes, cabbage, squash, herbs, and more.
[01:05:11.855 --> 01:05:15.856]  Then, harvest your seeds to grow year after year for old-time self-reliance.
[01:05:16.156 --> 01:05:19.837]  In Living Well on Wheat, learn how to cook, eat, and survive on the golden grain.
[01:05:20.217 --> 01:05:20.918]  We're good to go.
[01:05:50.097 --> 01:05:50.858]  We're good to go.
[01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:05.031]  This disaster is a new world order.
[01:06:05.131 --> 01:06:07.891]  A new world order can emerge.
[01:06:08.191 --> 01:06:12.413]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:12.473 --> 01:06:19.394]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:19.534 --> 01:06:21.535]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:21.795 --> 01:06:32.242]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:32.542 --> 01:06:37.906]  If you want to understand what the new rule order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:06:38.426 --> 01:06:41.088]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:06:41.168 --> 01:06:41.808]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:06:41.828 --> 01:06:42.188]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:06:42.208 --> 01:06:43.489]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:06:50.994 --> 01:06:54.276]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:06:54.336 --> 01:06:58.518]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:06:58.758 --> 01:07:01.539]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:07:01.739 --> 01:07:04.141]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:07:04.321 --> 01:07:12.985]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:07:13.165 --> 01:07:14.506]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:07:14.706 --> 01:07:18.848]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:07:19.128 --> 01:07:19.629]  We're good to go.
[01:07:38.311 --> 01:07:42.472]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:42.492 --> 01:07:43.472]  All right, we've got callers.
[01:08:06.562 --> 01:08:11.304]  Chicago to Atlantic City, from Austin, Texas to Los Angeles, California.
[01:08:11.324 --> 01:08:20.328]  Your calls are coming up later in this hour, but we've got Tom Flacco, a military veteran, a journalist, writes for major publications, a retired school teacher.
[01:08:20.348 --> 01:08:30.413]  I mean, he's done it all, and he's been down there at these whitewash, well, both the whitewash committees, the congressional one and this new one, and it's come out.
[01:08:30.633 --> 01:08:33.654]  You know, first off, let's impeach the committee itself.
[01:08:34.403 --> 01:08:34.984]  That's correct.
[01:08:35.004 --> 01:08:35.624]  That's correct.
[01:08:51.062 --> 01:09:06.896]  Let's go over that, then let's go through what you've seen happen in the committee and the witnesses that aren't ever brought forward that you then interview and that the media interviews, but then we never hear about because of the government gatekeepers inside of the mass media.
[01:09:07.416 --> 01:09:11.680]  Well, what struck me right off the bat was the questioning seemed a little tougher.
[01:09:12.119 --> 01:09:20.203]  However, as anyone who knows anything about the prosecutorial interrogation, it's the follow-up that's critical.
[01:09:20.243 --> 01:09:26.166]  You mean, you're telling me this, or why didn't you do that, or how come you did this, and there was no follow-up.
[01:09:26.206 --> 01:09:31.069]  The follow-up was very weak to poor, and that's where you're going to get some of the answers that you could get.
[01:09:31.589 --> 01:09:37.432]  See, the families and the media, everybody knew that Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld was
[01:09:37.692 --> 01:09:41.013]  Well, let's go over the timeline later, but I mean, this is Shakespearean theater.
[01:09:41.033 --> 01:09:43.314]  I mean, the Warren Commission supposedly asked tough questions.
[01:09:43.334 --> 01:09:43.794]  I mean, you know...
[01:09:56.298 --> 01:09:57.078]  This is theater.
[01:09:57.138 --> 01:10:02.960]  They don't bring up who called Condoleezza or why is it Condoleezza Rice here?
[01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:04.621]  Why has she been lying?
[01:10:04.661 --> 01:10:09.962]  They didn't bring up to the public why were public officials told not to fly?
[01:10:10.622 --> 01:10:15.104]  Why did FBI agents get cash bonuses for blocking other FBI agents?
[01:10:15.144 --> 01:10:17.384]  None of that real stuff was brought up.
[01:10:17.484 --> 01:10:22.826]  There's been close to 1,000 behind-the-doors, behind-closed-doors interviews
[01:10:23.306 --> 01:10:23.707]  I think so.
[01:10:23.727 --> 01:10:24.187]  I think so.
[01:10:43.525 --> 01:10:48.448]  But what we were doing, there was a big interest in Philip Zelico.
[01:10:48.468 --> 01:10:50.730]  The families were calling for him to resign immediately.
[01:10:50.750 --> 01:11:03.058]  It was all in the hallways, and a lot of the people that are listening to C-SPAN or watching C-SPAN don't realize that a lot of the action is taking place in between in these sidebar interviews with family members and some of the officials.
[01:11:03.098 --> 01:11:09.522]  Now, all the officials, Colin Powell, Armitage, Rumsfeld, none of them, all of them came in from the side door.
[01:11:09.582 --> 01:11:10.082]  None of them would
[01:11:10.478 --> 01:11:12.839]  Would stand for an interview in front of the media.
[01:11:12.859 --> 01:11:16.461]  They all slipped outside doors coming in, going out so that you had no contact.
[01:11:16.481 --> 01:11:16.961]  Yeah, I saw that.
[01:11:17.001 --> 01:11:21.023]  They're coming in through the back where the congressmen come in or the commissioners come in.
[01:11:21.223 --> 01:11:23.164]  Even at the end, they allow a press conference.
[01:11:23.244 --> 01:11:29.127]  I wasn't allowed to go to the press conference because I don't work for a recognized media like the Washington Post or something.
[01:11:29.147 --> 01:11:35.210]  And so all of the hard questions being asked by a few of us who have spent a great deal of time
[01:11:35.629 --> 01:11:36.369]  I think so.
[01:11:58.877 --> 01:12:01.358]  Anybody that's asking intrusive questions.
[01:12:01.498 --> 01:12:12.464]  Well, I mean, let's go over that particular commissioner who, again, this is the Associated Press, admittedly involved in covering up 9-11 evidence for Bush, and then is a supposed independent commissioner.
[01:12:12.704 --> 01:12:14.705]  Why are the families calling for this guy to resign?
[01:12:14.905 --> 01:12:26.110]  Well, this is Philip Zelikow, and he is the staff director of the executive director, and he has control over the flow of the whole investigation.
[01:12:26.130 --> 01:12:27.591]  And what makes it interesting is that
[01:12:28.069 --> 01:12:34.222]  The two people, there were only two individuals who were allowed to see the presidential daily briefings.
[01:12:34.362 --> 01:12:37.850]  And those briefings would indicate whether the president had prior knowledge
[01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:39.641]  Alex, the media is not covering.
[01:12:39.661 --> 01:12:41.422]  That was the most explosive thing.
[01:12:41.442 --> 01:12:43.164]  And then Rumsfeld, or not Rumsfeld, the
[01:13:07.017 --> 01:13:08.278]  Was it Rumsfeld's testimony?
[01:13:08.558 --> 01:13:09.699]  Talked about hijacking.
[01:13:09.739 --> 01:13:10.900]  I believe it was Rumsfeld's.
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:13.001]  It mentioned hijackings.
[01:13:14.221 --> 01:13:17.023]  Or it was... No, I knew it was.
[01:13:17.063 --> 01:13:17.563]  It was Tennant.
[01:13:17.884 --> 01:13:24.087]  George Tennant was telegraphing the fact that hijackings were mentioned in some of the briefings.
[01:13:24.127 --> 01:13:26.288]  That's mentioned in the transcript, so you can look at that.
[01:13:26.849 --> 01:13:30.891]  But all of this kind of came to a head all at once.
[01:13:31.691 --> 01:13:33.392]  And that's the amazing thing.
[01:13:33.432 --> 01:13:36.154]  Zelikow and Gorelick were the two that were picked.
[01:13:36.522 --> 01:13:39.544]  Now, Philip Zelikow is not even appointed by Congress.
[01:13:39.644 --> 01:13:41.285]  He's appointed by the staff.
[01:13:41.865 --> 01:13:44.227]  So he directs the whole investigation.
[01:13:44.267 --> 01:13:51.851]  He knows who's going to testify, when they're going to testify, what they said behind closed doors, what they might say, what questions are going to be asked, how they're going to be asked.
[01:13:52.111 --> 01:13:52.672]  Everything.
[01:13:52.972 --> 01:13:58.395]  He controls the total inner workings of the... Yeah, this is a kangaroo court.
[01:13:58.515 --> 01:14:01.737]  Yeah, Philip Zelikow... And Tom, not just...
[01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:11.633]  The overt cover-up and prior knowledge and involvement by the globalists, but just the body language of Powell and Armitage and all of them.
[01:14:12.013 --> 01:14:16.175]  I mean, my wife walked in and saw Armitage up there and said he looks like the kingpin.
[01:14:16.895 --> 01:14:19.076]  Tenet looks like he's ready for the Sopranos.
[01:14:19.096 --> 01:14:21.857]  You know, the arrogance, the smacking, the laughing.
[01:14:22.097 --> 01:14:29.040]  We're talking about thousands of dead people, and Armitage is just laughing and joking and rolling his eyes.
[01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:30.881]  I mean, these are arrogant kingpins.
[01:14:31.488 --> 01:14:33.910]  Well, they're also wealthy, arrogant kingpins.
[01:14:34.851 --> 01:14:37.433]  They're totally above the people, and they're above scrutiny.
[01:14:38.574 --> 01:14:46.060]  When you've got somebody like Zelikow, who worked in the CIA, he worked for Senior Bush, he worked for James Baker.
[01:14:46.741 --> 01:14:47.681]  We found all this stuff.
[01:14:47.701 --> 01:14:49.223]  We were doing a deep Google search.
[01:14:49.243 --> 01:14:54.407]  In other words, we were going back into page 40 and 50, looking for everything.
[01:14:55.188 --> 01:14:59.271]  He wrote a book called Why People Can't Trust the Government with Two Other People.
[01:14:59.913 --> 01:15:02.895]  And, you know, it's just amazing some of the things.
[01:15:02.995 --> 01:15:07.219]  And he wrote a book with, I believe he wrote two books with Condoleezza Rice.
[01:15:07.579 --> 01:15:08.480]  We have smacking.
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:10.761]  He was on the Bush transition team.
[01:15:11.502 --> 01:15:19.188]  And he's not even appointed, and he gets to look at all 4,000-plus PDBs, the Presidential Daily Briefings, and have access.
[01:15:19.288 --> 01:15:24.372]  And then he and Gorelick, Jamie Gorelick, who's a member of President Bush's CIA intelligence branch,
[01:15:25.336 --> 01:15:25.676]  I think so.
[01:15:41.825 --> 01:15:45.487]  So this is the supposed independent commission.
[01:15:45.707 --> 01:15:46.708]  I want people to listen to this.
[01:15:47.128 --> 01:15:56.294]  This is Bush talking about, on 9-11, before he goes out and reads the little goat story to the elementary school students, this is Bush saying, oh yeah, he saw the plane crash, which no one had seen.
[01:15:56.574 --> 01:15:58.676]  Six months later, the French video came out of it.
[01:15:59.156 --> 01:16:00.697]  No one had footage of the first plane.
[01:16:00.877 --> 01:16:03.799]  But he says he saw that first plane hitting the building.
[01:16:03.819 --> 01:16:09.863]  Of course, before he claimed he first learned of all this, while reading the little goat story from a chief of staff, Mr. Card.
[01:16:09.923 --> 01:16:10.864]  But again, here it is.
[01:16:11.184 --> 01:16:12.925]  What do you think of that?
[01:16:12.985 --> 01:16:13.965]  Yeah, I mean...
[01:16:29.318 --> 01:16:35.159]  There are so many issues here where you've got presidential knowledge of the hijacking.
[01:16:35.399 --> 01:16:36.039]  Well, I'll tell you what, Tom.
[01:16:36.059 --> 01:16:41.920]  We're going to get into that in just a second because I want to go to the timeline and what you think some of the biggest smoking guns of prior knowledge and even involvement are.
[01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:43.861]  But for those that just missed it, here it is again.
[01:16:44.541 --> 01:16:51.302]  I was sitting outside the classroom waiting to go in, and I saw an airplane hit the tower.
[01:16:52.062 --> 01:16:58.003]  The TV was obviously on, and I used to fly myself, and I said, well, there's one terrible pilot.
[01:16:59.034 --> 01:16:59.995]  So what do you think of that?
[01:17:01.716 --> 01:17:02.296]  Unbelievable.
[01:17:02.976 --> 01:17:03.597]  What can you say?
[01:17:04.837 --> 01:17:07.659]  The public is totally unaware of this.
[01:17:07.959 --> 01:17:20.126]  The overwhelming majority of the people, there are just 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 people in the world that probably are well-read on 9-11 and understand and can articulate some of the issues and where the real problems lie.
[01:17:20.146 --> 01:17:26.450]  But see, Gorelick and Zelico get to pick these briefings, and the thing is, they get to choose...
[01:17:27.074 --> 01:17:33.896]  Which briefings are promulgated forward for Chairman Keene and Vice Chairman Hamilton?
[01:17:34.416 --> 01:17:38.657]  But then again, Keene and Hamilton are establishment whitewashers from a long time ago.
[01:17:38.877 --> 01:17:40.778]  Hamilton goes back to the old Iran-Contra.
[01:17:40.938 --> 01:17:46.959]  Many people claim that he had a part in calming down the Iran-Contra BCCI problem.
[01:17:47.299 --> 01:17:48.980]  It's the same crew of kingpins.
[01:17:50.532 --> 01:17:53.114]  Tom, let's go over some of the big smoking guns.
[01:17:53.134 --> 01:17:56.476]  Well, first, let's do the timeline, you know, the obvious prior knowledge.
[01:17:56.516 --> 01:17:58.557]  Then let's get into this major story you broke.
[01:17:58.877 --> 01:18:00.579]  And again, the media was all around this lady.
[01:18:01.159 --> 01:18:06.542]  One of their code breakers, one of their decipherers, and they told her, you shut up, we'll give you a better job.
[01:18:06.602 --> 01:18:07.843]  If you don't, we're going to arrest you.
[01:18:08.884 --> 01:18:09.104]  Yeah.
[01:18:09.224 --> 01:18:10.545]  Let's go ahead and cover that now.
[01:18:11.065 --> 01:18:14.207]  Yeah, it's just quite incredible.
[01:18:14.968 --> 01:18:16.289]  I was walking around coming back...
[01:18:17.199 --> 01:18:25.204]  From a quick run to the restroom, I see Michael Isikoff, Kelly Wallace, and David Korn standing around Kristen Breitweiser.
[01:18:25.224 --> 01:18:26.885]  I went up and we're asking questions.
[01:18:26.925 --> 01:18:28.926]  They asked a few and she's doing a lot of talking.
[01:18:30.867 --> 01:18:34.930]  The conversation kind of drifted to things that were happening.
[01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:36.751]  What did they know before the event?
[01:18:37.071 --> 01:18:37.992]  Kristen's talking about it.
[01:18:38.372 --> 01:18:39.713]  All of a sudden she says, wait a minute.
[01:18:39.913 --> 01:18:41.894]  For those who don't know, tell us who this person is.
[01:18:42.074 --> 01:18:43.815]  Kristen Breitweiser is probably the
[01:18:46.215 --> 01:18:51.276]  Right now, the number one spokesman for the 9-11 victim family.
[01:18:51.316 --> 01:19:00.198]  She's generally the most articulate, quick on her feet person who's able to bring forth the real issues.
[01:19:00.439 --> 01:19:02.859]  She's one of the so-called Jersey girls.
[01:19:02.899 --> 01:19:09.701]  The women, Patty Cazazza, Lori Van Alken, and Kristen Breitweiser.
[01:19:09.721 --> 01:19:12.121]  Okay, so you're there and they're talking inside the Capitol.
[01:19:12.702 --> 01:19:13.862]  And so they're all talking.
[01:19:15.174 --> 01:19:15.915]  We're good to go.
[01:19:24.116 --> 01:19:26.117]  Gathering around Breitweiser.
[01:19:26.137 --> 01:19:27.879]  Now Van Alken's starting to talk a little bit.
[01:19:28.239 --> 01:19:33.082]  And pretty soon Breitweiser brings a woman by the name of Sibel Edmunds.
[01:19:33.102 --> 01:19:35.464]  S-I-B-E-L-E-D-M-O-N-D-S.
[01:19:35.564 --> 01:19:44.751]  Sibel Edmunds comes forward and she starts to talk about her problems as a translator, a linguist with the FBI.
[01:19:44.991 --> 01:19:48.814]  Yeah, we'll come back and talk about this and some of the other big smoking guns.
[01:19:48.834 --> 01:19:49.194]  Stay with us.
[01:19:51.644 --> 01:19:55.126]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:19:55.386 --> 01:19:58.887]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:19:58.987 --> 01:20:02.929]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:20:03.149 --> 01:20:09.312]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:20:09.712 --> 01:20:17.636]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:20:18.036 --> 01:20:23.380]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:27.323]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:20:27.683 --> 01:20:29.545]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:20:29.585 --> 01:20:31.767]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:20:32.007 --> 01:20:36.950]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:20:36.990 --> 01:20:42.535]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:21:50.555 --> 01:21:51.495]  Is America bankrupt?
[01:21:51.675 --> 01:21:54.236]  Are we on the verge of an all-out economic collapse?
[01:21:54.556 --> 01:21:57.037]  What can be done to protect your family and assets?
[01:21:57.257 --> 01:22:00.318]  What kinds of investments will be able to withstand an economic meltdown?
[01:22:00.458 --> 01:22:02.999]  The problem is it's not always easy to find great solutions.
[01:22:03.159 --> 01:22:06.800]  And during these dangerous economic times, finding the right solution is crucial.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:13.422]  Midas Resources has been a leader in educating people not only about the shaky economic future and its many problems, but also the solutions.

[01:22:19.264 --> 01:22:23.668]  The incredible story of how you and America are being bankrupted and what you can do to avoid the wipeout.
[01:22:23.928 --> 01:22:27.512]  Read Economic Solutions and learn about the greatest scam ever, the Federal Reserve Act.
[01:22:27.712 --> 01:22:31.155]  Learn about the great income tax swindle and the agenda of the New World Order.
[01:22:31.556 --> 01:22:36.240]  And learn how you can take steps now to protect yourself and family during these uncertain times.
[01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:38.720]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:39.201]  Michael Trudeau here.
[01:22:39.221 --> 01:22:41.581]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[01:22:41.621 --> 01:22:44.382]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident...
[01:23:01.465 --> 01:23:03.667]  That injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[01:23:03.787 --> 01:23:06.851]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[01:23:07.071 --> 01:23:11.355]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[01:23:11.555 --> 01:23:13.457]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[01:23:13.577 --> 01:23:20.644]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[01:23:20.824 --> 01:23:23.287]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[01:23:23.587 --> 01:23:27.910]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice, only this time it changed my life.
[01:23:28.190 --> 01:23:29.951]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement.
[01:23:30.031 --> 01:23:32.152]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[01:23:32.332 --> 01:23:34.774]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[01:23:34.814 --> 01:23:37.515]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[01:23:37.696 --> 01:23:38.236]  Side effects?
[01:23:38.396 --> 01:23:40.677]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[01:23:40.837 --> 01:23:42.118]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[01:23:42.158 --> 01:23:42.358]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[01:23:42.378 --> 01:23:43.979]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[01:23:43.999 --> 01:23:44.620]  It worked for me.
[01:23:54.332 --> 01:24:00.358]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:24:00.958 --> 01:24:03.961]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:07.424 --> 01:24:19.155]  I can tell it's very frustrating for Tom Flacco to try to go over all this information, give you all the details, because he's been in the middle of it, researching it for so long as a highly respected investigative journalist.
[01:24:19.938 --> 01:24:23.100]  So just remember, Tom, a lot of people don't have the level of knowledge you do.
[01:24:23.481 --> 01:24:32.908]  Just with bullet points, go through this major news story, and then some of the major smoking guns you've documented in the past year plus at these hearings.
[01:24:33.248 --> 01:24:39.633]  So you've got this admitted FBI linguist, codebreaker, individual, and...
[01:24:40.733 --> 01:24:45.957]  There's a story there that the media is all around her with news cameras and the rest of it, and none of that makes it out.
[01:24:46.137 --> 01:24:47.258]  That right there is a story.
[01:24:47.598 --> 01:24:49.820]  Number two, she's not the only one.
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:56.984]  There are probably 50 people that we know of, FBI, CIA, others, who have been told to shut up about prior knowledge.
[01:24:57.525 --> 01:25:00.267]  Well, she's starting to talk.
[01:25:00.947 --> 01:25:07.812]  At the time, this had been broken by CBS News on a short segment on one of their programs a year ago.
[01:25:08.277 --> 01:25:13.001]  But the issue, what made it so important was she was breaking much, much more new ground.
[01:25:13.402 --> 01:25:17.985]  The issue before was she was hired and she found some irregularities in the translations.
[01:25:18.586 --> 01:25:20.588]  It was shoddy, what she called shoddy translations.
[01:25:21.789 --> 01:25:25.372]  Yeah, CBS spun it that it was just laziness.
[01:25:25.412 --> 01:25:26.393]  Yes, exactly.
[01:25:27.214 --> 01:25:31.077]  But now we know it's John Ashcroft calling her saying, you want a big job or you want to go to jail?
[01:25:31.897 --> 01:25:34.017]  Well, that's the issue, of course.
[01:25:35.258 --> 01:25:42.319]  She had said that she would go in and make a translation, and then she'd come back the next morning, and the translations would be missing, and she'd get all mad.
[01:25:42.579 --> 01:25:43.719]  So it's not laziness.
[01:25:43.759 --> 01:25:45.119]  It's not them missing things.
[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:48.240]  Yeah, what they're doing is they're taking the translations off.
[01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:51.641]  We're trying to teach you a lesson, I believe, was something that was said like that.
[01:25:52.461 --> 01:25:58.842]  But when you get into the new allegations, she's fluent in Farsi and Turkish.
[01:25:59.304 --> 01:26:00.345]  She speaks the languages.
[01:26:00.905 --> 01:26:04.548]  She's been working for the FBI for six months, and that's all she said.
[01:26:04.588 --> 01:26:05.729]  Now, I got a chance.
[01:26:05.949 --> 01:26:10.573]  It was about 40 or 50 people gathered around, firing questions at her like crazy.
[01:26:10.613 --> 01:26:12.494]  She's talking, and people are scribbling.
[01:26:12.514 --> 01:26:13.475]  We're scribbling notes down.
[01:26:14.015 --> 01:26:24.403]  Then she walks away, and they put her in front of a whole bank of cameras and microphones with cameras running, and they reiterate the whole thing all over again and ask her the same types of questions.
[01:26:24.463 --> 01:26:25.264]  Now it comes out that
[01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:27.242]  You know, people were asking, were you bribed?
[01:26:27.302 --> 01:26:29.704]  And I guess you can interpret it as that.
[01:26:29.745 --> 01:26:30.966]  Yeah, let me read her quotes.
[01:26:31.967 --> 01:26:35.591]  In a 50-reporter frenzy in front of some 12 news cameras, Edmund said...
[01:26:36.511 --> 01:26:47.574]  Attorney General John Ashcroft told me, quote, he was invoking state secret privilege and national security when I told the FBI I wanted to go public with what I had translated from the pre-9-11 intercepts.
[01:26:47.634 --> 01:26:48.134]  Close quote.
[01:26:48.354 --> 01:26:48.894]  Another quote.
[01:26:49.314 --> 01:26:58.276]  I appeared once on CBS 60 Minutes, but I have been silenced by Mr. Ashcroft, and the FBI follows me, and I was threatened with jail in 2002 if I went public.
[01:26:58.903 --> 01:26:59.644]  And it goes on.
[01:26:59.824 --> 01:27:00.565]  That's correct.
[01:27:00.985 --> 01:27:10.173]  The term came from the October 18, 2002 DOJ memo to me from DOJ spokesman Barbara Comstock telling her that it was a state secret privilege not to talk about it.
[01:27:10.493 --> 01:27:11.374]  That's another quote.
[01:27:11.894 --> 01:27:13.296]  There's a bunch of others we'll go into.
[01:27:13.316 --> 01:27:13.916]  Please continue.
[01:27:14.056 --> 01:27:15.017]  Well, exactly.
[01:27:15.498 --> 01:27:18.560]  So Comstock had given her a memo.
[01:27:18.961 --> 01:27:22.824]  Now, I got a chance to get Sabelle off to the side by myself with her
[01:27:23.365 --> 01:27:26.386]  And I asked her, you mean to tell me you were bribed?
[01:27:26.446 --> 01:27:29.648]  Just trying to get her to reiterate, to verify this.
[01:27:29.688 --> 01:27:34.149]  And I kept thinking, well, what's the big deal about the translations?
[01:27:34.349 --> 01:27:35.770]  And I said, when did you start?
[01:27:35.790 --> 01:27:37.611]  I started in December.
[01:27:38.391 --> 01:27:38.751]  What year?
[01:27:38.771 --> 01:27:39.371]  December of 2001.
[01:27:39.892 --> 01:27:43.033]  And I'm thinking, I asked her, well, that's after the attacks.
[01:27:43.413 --> 01:27:44.754]  And she said, but you don't understand.
[01:27:45.074 --> 01:27:52.877]  I was asked to re-translate, was her word, and change the contents of
[01:27:53.450 --> 01:27:53.790]  Pre-9-11.
[01:27:54.130 --> 01:27:57.311]  And they were covering up, exactly.
[01:27:57.531 --> 01:27:58.231]  What was in there.
[01:27:58.251 --> 01:27:59.931]  In other words, just the transcripts.
[01:28:00.071 --> 01:28:04.432]  This is them altering evidence for the Whitewash Kangaroo Commission.
[01:28:04.532 --> 01:28:05.712]  And this is not a story.
[01:28:05.732 --> 01:28:07.472]  This is not a story.
[01:28:07.552 --> 01:28:08.473]  Alex, it's incredible.
[01:28:08.733 --> 01:28:09.493]  I'm flabbergasted.
[01:28:09.513 --> 01:28:10.173]  I do a search.
[01:28:10.293 --> 01:28:16.854]  This is one million times bigger than Nixon spying on the Democrats.
[01:28:18.094 --> 01:28:19.134]  It's totally incredible.
[01:28:19.575 --> 01:28:22.155]  And what makes it the biggest story is that it's not a story.
[01:28:22.811 --> 01:28:26.012]  Now, that's the caveat, side story.
[01:28:26.333 --> 01:28:31.375]  I said to Kelly Wallace as I was bypassing, I said, Kelly, I hope you're going to put this story on the air now.
[01:28:31.415 --> 01:28:32.415]  I said, I'm going to go write it.
[01:28:32.435 --> 01:28:34.856]  So what I did is I hightailed it downstairs.
[01:28:34.876 --> 01:28:35.816]  I had left my cell phone.
[01:28:35.856 --> 01:28:38.337]  It didn't charge right overnight, so I couldn't call right from the spot.
[01:28:38.758 --> 01:28:51.723]  So now, again, it's 12.15, 12.30, and I sat down there on the floor with scribbled notes in my hand and just dictated a story into a hard-line telephone to my webmaster, and he was typing it as he went into it.
[01:28:52.170 --> 01:28:52.771]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:29:04.082 --> 01:29:09.364]  I figured, heck, I found out that I might be the only one in the whole country that has this story in a line.
[01:29:09.404 --> 01:29:10.584]  I'm totally flabbergasted.
[01:29:10.624 --> 01:29:19.747]  And then I have the Chicago Sun-Times saying Homeland Security is basically running Hollywood, and we've got a $70 million fake newscast package running right now in the New York Times.
[01:29:20.087 --> 01:29:21.407]  So, the media is controlled.
[01:29:21.607 --> 01:29:22.948]  Did you find anybody else?
[01:29:23.428 --> 01:29:24.349]  That ran this story?
[01:29:24.389 --> 01:29:24.629]  No.
[01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:29.613]  And by the way, Tom's run a bunch of other stories that months later get picked up by the mainstream.
[01:29:29.633 --> 01:29:30.314]  He's very credible.
[01:29:30.834 --> 01:29:31.435]  Stay there, Tom.
[01:29:31.455 --> 01:29:31.975]  We've got to come back.
[01:29:31.995 --> 01:29:36.059]  I want to get into other big smoking guns that you've covered that nobody else has covered.
[01:29:36.379 --> 01:29:38.361]  Then I want to get into the timeline and take calls.
[01:29:38.701 --> 01:29:39.462]  Stay with us.
[01:29:39.542 --> 01:29:40.723]  We shall return.
[01:29:42.184 --> 01:29:43.085]  We're on the march.
[01:29:43.585 --> 01:29:45.207]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:46.127 --> 01:29:48.790]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:51.969 --> 01:29:59.473]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:29:59.753 --> 01:30:10.659]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:30:10.939 --> 01:30:12.740]  Yet require very little energy.
[01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:16.341]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:30:16.661 --> 01:30:27.104]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:30:27.424 --> 01:30:27.925]  That's right.
[01:30:28.105 --> 01:30:35.211]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:30:35.512 --> 01:30:43.939]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:43.959 --> 01:30:44.480]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:52.227 --> 01:30:54.528]  What do you know about the quality of air outside these days?
[01:30:54.648 --> 01:30:55.149]  Pollution.
[01:30:55.169 --> 01:30:55.449]  Holland.
[01:30:55.489 --> 01:30:56.629]  Is it as healthy as you'd like it?
[01:30:56.669 --> 01:30:57.050]  Allergies.
[01:30:57.210 --> 01:30:57.510]  Asthma.
[01:30:57.530 --> 01:30:58.090]  Probably not.
[01:30:58.270 --> 01:30:58.991]  Well, listen to this.
[01:30:59.231 --> 01:31:08.196]  Did you know, according to the American Lung Association, combined with the EPA, the air quality inside your home is actually six to ten times worse than the air outside?
[01:31:08.276 --> 01:31:09.096]  Six to ten times?
[01:31:09.116 --> 01:31:10.057]  How could that be, you ass?
[01:31:14.193 --> 01:31:14.913]  We're good to go.
[01:31:14.934 --> 01:31:15.514]  We're good to go.
[01:31:15.574 --> 01:31:16.054]  We're good to go.
[01:31:31.523 --> 01:31:44.087]  What this air cleaning system does is remove dangerous airborne particles like smoke, odors, VOCs, allergens, fine dust, mold, pollen, and kills bacteria for less than half the cost of other air purifiers, which do a lot less.
[01:31:44.147 --> 01:31:45.247]  Call them now to breathe easier.
[01:31:45.267 --> 01:31:45.327]  888-491-4100.
[01:31:45.347 --> 01:31:46.327]  The PureTech Pure Air System.
[01:31:46.347 --> 01:31:47.408]  Online at puretech.com.
[01:31:51.989 --> 01:31:52.390]  We're good to go.
[01:32:12.529 --> 01:32:19.054]  How to save money, old-time skills, what's new in alternative energy, how to be healthier and happier by living a simpler, more stress-free life.
[01:32:19.215 --> 01:32:22.457]  And if you act now, we'll send you a sample issue absolutely free.

[01:32:36.769 --> 01:32:41.453]  If you decide it's not for you, simply write cancel on the invoice, but keep the magazine just for taking a look.
[01:32:41.653 --> 01:32:42.493]  It's as simple as that.
[01:32:42.713 --> 01:32:51.537]  Get ready to live the good life and call 1-800-551-5691 or visit our website at www.countrysidemag.com.
[01:32:56.639 --> 01:33:01.081]  We're talking to investigative journalist Tom Flocko.
[01:33:03.042 --> 01:33:07.804]  Written for World Net Daily, From the Wilderness, Newsmax, you name it.
[01:33:09.116 --> 01:33:14.678]  He's been there covering the 9-11 whitewash committee, too, that they tried to have Henry Kissinger head up, but nobody bought that.
[01:33:14.858 --> 01:33:19.820]  Everybody else involved in this thing has just as many connections to Lord Bush and James Baker and the rest of them.
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:24.041]  Most of the committee members are in business with those testifying, literally.
[01:33:24.641 --> 01:33:25.922]  But the media says it's independent.
[01:33:25.942 --> 01:33:26.502]  You can trust them.
[01:33:26.902 --> 01:33:35.345]  We've got a bunch of calls for you, Tom, but let's get into some of the other big smoking guns that have come out that nobody else has seen to report or that they later kind of bring out and...
[01:33:36.602 --> 01:33:37.863]  And watered down as well.
[01:33:37.883 --> 01:33:43.907]  And then let's get into the timeline of some of the key smoking guns on 9-11, and then we'll go to the calls.
[01:33:45.088 --> 01:33:49.371]  Well, there was a great deal of mention about hijackings.
[01:33:49.971 --> 01:33:55.195]  There was a lot of interest in that with regard to what the government knew and when it knew it.
[01:33:55.955 --> 01:34:03.020]  And Timothy Romer probably said it the best when he expressed the fact that there were
[01:34:04.031 --> 01:34:04.292]  I think so.
[01:34:15.979 --> 01:34:31.650]  Is that if the American people ever find out, the majority of them find out, that they knew that planes used as weapons was one of the key areas of this investigation and the fact that Arab terrorists were taking flying lessons in the United States.
[01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:35.033]  And the government knew and then lied and said they never heard that.
[01:34:35.613 --> 01:34:38.135]  And then on that day it shows they knew what was going on.
[01:34:38.435 --> 01:34:41.257]  You see, my brother is a Delta Airlines captain.
[01:34:41.943 --> 01:34:45.605]  And he's retired now, just retired.
[01:34:46.405 --> 01:34:55.751]  He just called me on the phone and he said, I just read a story about, you know, there's a lot of talk about the bin Laden's being escorted out of the air, you know, out of the country.
[01:34:56.131 --> 01:35:04.415]  And he had heard, he had just finished reading the book by Kevin Phillips, the Bush Dynasty book, and it mentioned something like seven or eight flights.
[01:35:05.076 --> 01:35:06.636]  And I always thought it was two or three flights.
[01:35:07.197 --> 01:35:09.838]  And you have to remember, all of the planes were grounded.
[01:35:09.878 --> 01:35:11.339]  He told me that it would take about,
[01:35:11.852 --> 01:35:13.333]  I've talked to a couple actually at the airport.
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:43.261]  Well, this came out in the Sentinel.
[01:35:43.341 --> 01:35:45.402]  It came out in the Miami Herald in the days after.
[01:35:45.422 --> 01:35:47.163]  The media tried to claim it was an urban legend.
[01:35:47.183 --> 01:35:48.664]  The former counterterrorism chief had to admit...
[01:36:07.208 --> 01:36:10.849]  Just last year, and he told Vanity Fair that, yeah, it was a presidential order.
[01:36:11.029 --> 01:36:13.830]  That's how the FAA and the military let these people leave.
[01:36:14.010 --> 01:36:16.510]  Yes, and this was, I believe it was Tenet's testimony.
[01:36:16.530 --> 01:36:17.731]  They mentioned this issue.
[01:36:17.751 --> 01:36:19.591]  It was brought up again by Romer.
[01:36:21.332 --> 01:36:23.532]  Romer and... I haven't watched all the tapes.
[01:36:23.552 --> 01:36:24.352]  I only saw some of it.
[01:36:25.353 --> 01:36:26.593]  And, of course, the media hasn't talked about it.
[01:36:26.613 --> 01:36:29.334]  You're saying they brought up, lined the lines out to Tenet?
[01:36:29.354 --> 01:36:29.954]  Yes, they did.
[01:36:30.014 --> 01:36:33.995]  And they asked him why... I'm going to have this in my news notes.
[01:36:34.095 --> 01:36:34.715]  Apparently, see...
[01:36:35.157 --> 01:36:39.039]  I'm taking this for granted that the media's going to report all this stuff, and apparently they're not.
[01:36:39.479 --> 01:36:46.363]  You know, Alex, so I guess I'm going to have to write my little chatty news notes deal where I'm going to do a two or three paragraphs on some of these things that struck me.
[01:36:46.663 --> 01:36:47.484]  Well, that struck me.
[01:36:47.544 --> 01:36:49.385]  Well, what did Tenet do when this got raised?
[01:36:49.445 --> 01:36:52.867]  Well, he said that they weren't questioned.
[01:36:52.927 --> 01:36:53.867]  No one was questioned.
[01:36:57.429 --> 01:37:01.151]  This was mentioned at least once, and I'm trying to think now.
[01:37:01.392 --> 01:37:02.612]  I'm pretty sure it was Tenet.
[01:37:04.770 --> 01:37:05.911]  It might have been one of the others.
[01:37:05.951 --> 01:37:14.798]  Don't quote me on this because, again, I just got home and I've had to take a day's sleep just to catch up from being up all night for three straight days, or a good chunk of the night.
[01:37:15.159 --> 01:37:19.682]  What I'm saying is that was brought up in testimony and I know it was Romer that brought it up.
[01:37:19.702 --> 01:37:20.783]  You can check the transcripts.
[01:37:22.564 --> 01:37:31.468]  Yeah, there's a lot of that going on.
[01:37:32.308 --> 01:37:41.812]  You see, I was shocked to hear that because they said, someone, I think Romer, said, you mean they got out of the country and they weren't questioned by the FBI?
[01:37:42.292 --> 01:37:43.092]  I believe that's true.
[01:37:43.112 --> 01:37:46.814]  And it was the president getting them out of the country with his orders.
[01:37:47.392 --> 01:37:47.612]  Yes.
[01:37:48.012 --> 01:37:49.573]  So this is massive again.
[01:37:49.733 --> 01:37:54.896]  This had to come from the very highest areas.
[01:37:54.916 --> 01:38:08.042]  Also, last year you were there, and the FAA spokeswoman said that, oh, that morning, even before the crashes began, the attacks began, that the White House was already on the phone tree with the FAA.
[01:38:08.842 --> 01:38:10.903]  Yes, the phone, I have the email.
[01:38:10.923 --> 01:38:14.505]  They originally told us it was 820, then she wrote me a separate private email saying,
[01:38:16.381 --> 01:38:18.990]  Later that night, saying that it was 845 rather than
[01:38:21.068 --> 01:38:35.793]  Well, we know darn well that that issue is safe because there's no way that if the President knew at 8.30, then the phone bridges had to have started at 8.20, 8.25 in the morning at least.
[01:38:35.833 --> 01:38:39.414]  He was attended to by his own private secret service detail.
[01:38:39.454 --> 01:38:44.695]  Well, Bush says he saw the first plane hit, but nobody else did for six months until the French video got brought forward.
[01:38:44.715 --> 01:38:45.616]  I mean, how did he do that?
[01:38:46.596 --> 01:38:48.436]  Alex, boy, I'll tell you what.
[01:38:48.637 --> 01:38:49.837]  These are the kind of questions...
[01:38:50.297 --> 01:38:51.898]  And there's thousands of them.
[01:38:51.918 --> 01:38:52.839]  There's thousands of them.
[01:38:52.859 --> 01:39:04.007]  Alex, it drives you nuts when you sit there and listen to a policy wonk history, college history lecture with poor preparation of questions for the most part and terrible, worse follow-up.
[01:39:04.528 --> 01:39:08.691]  See, basically, the president, the chairman of the commission, Tom Kino, is an honorable man.
[01:39:09.147 --> 01:39:12.070]  But he's acting like a fancy restaurant maitre d'.
[01:39:12.411 --> 01:39:14.072]  And he asked, well, what could we have done?
[01:39:14.493 --> 01:39:15.854]  Everything was, what could we do?
[01:39:15.874 --> 01:39:18.757]  Well, the commission said at the outset that we're not going to blame the government.
[01:39:18.777 --> 01:39:21.440]  We're just going to find out how we can not do this again.
[01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:22.722]  Yeah, it's turning.
[01:39:22.762 --> 01:39:25.144]  The families are turning it into something far different.
[01:39:25.164 --> 01:39:25.945]  Trust me on that.
[01:39:25.985 --> 01:39:26.506]  Yeah, so what's...
[01:39:27.547 --> 01:39:34.794]  I want to get more into the timeline and then some calls, but being there for week after week during these hearings over the last year and a half, you're there with the families.
[01:39:34.814 --> 01:39:35.695]  We've had a lot of them on.
[01:39:35.735 --> 01:39:37.016]  They believe Bush did it.
[01:39:38.317 --> 01:39:42.482]  I've had Stanley Hilton and all these other lawyers on who represent them.
[01:39:42.862 --> 01:39:45.284]  But when you're talking to the families, what's going on?
[01:39:45.344 --> 01:39:46.706]  What's an average discussion like?
[01:39:47.170 --> 01:39:53.172]  Well, they're calling for a new set of hearings to investigate 9-11.
[01:39:53.452 --> 01:39:56.553]  In other words, they're saying we don't want history lessons.
[01:39:56.593 --> 01:39:58.433]  We don't want what's been going on.
[01:39:58.453 --> 01:39:59.634]  This is politics.
[01:40:00.134 --> 01:40:06.296]  And by history lesson you mean it's all how dangerous Al-Qaeda was and why they broke the wall and how busy they are?
[01:40:06.929 --> 01:40:11.834]  And let's, you know, we don't want this to happen again, so what policy should we change so that we can move on?
[01:40:12.074 --> 01:40:16.078]  And the committee says the domestic CIA is the answer, big government's the answer.
[01:40:16.178 --> 01:40:19.041]  Alex, there is nothing about accountability.
[01:40:19.321 --> 01:40:26.007]  The only person who made himself accountable was Richard Clark, who has worked for both administrations, I believe, right?
[01:40:26.127 --> 01:40:30.852]  And so he said, you know, I want to apologize to the families.
[01:40:32.053 --> 01:40:34.795]  Let me say something else.
[01:40:34.895 --> 01:40:44.463]  I did see one of the commissioners bring up that why did the FBI agents that blocked good FBI agents get record cash bonuses, but then they didn't answer the question and there's no follow-up.
[01:40:44.983 --> 01:40:46.524]  Alex, there's been subpoena votes.
[01:40:47.305 --> 01:40:48.626]  I asked Timothy Romer.
[01:40:49.481 --> 01:40:54.247]  Point blank, Slade, Gordon, point blank, Bob Carey, point blank, individual, myself.
[01:40:54.387 --> 01:40:59.352]  I asked all three of them, and when I asked Carey, there were about 20 to 25 reporters standing there.
[01:40:59.672 --> 01:41:02.215]  I asked all of them, why aren't you using your subpoena power?
[01:41:02.235 --> 01:41:08.102]  And I said, have you voted for subpoenas to subpoena the Condoleezza Rice?
[01:41:08.282 --> 01:41:09.083]  And they wouldn't answer.
[01:41:09.323 --> 01:41:10.184]  Nobody will answer.
[01:41:10.604 --> 01:41:13.786]  And they will say, Romer said, I voted to subpoena.
[01:41:13.906 --> 01:41:15.046]  Now, why don't they want Rice?
[01:41:15.066 --> 01:41:17.667]  Because they stuck her out on TV and she told a bunch of lies.
[01:41:17.687 --> 01:41:20.609]  She now admits those are the lies about we never heard of a plan to play.
[01:41:20.709 --> 01:41:23.790]  Well, the other thing is, I have another story, a title.
[01:41:23.810 --> 01:41:25.711]  You know, I love to fool around with titles.
[01:41:26.051 --> 01:41:27.952]  And this title, the definition of is, is.
[01:41:28.212 --> 01:41:31.293]  We now have a new definition of what is, is.
[01:41:31.393 --> 01:41:32.294]  And you want to know what it is?
[01:41:32.634 --> 01:41:39.257]  The President of the United States is saying that if I'd only have known that they were going to take airplanes...
[01:41:39.696 --> 01:41:40.977]  And fly them into buildings.
[01:41:41.017 --> 01:41:43.439]  He said that at the last story.
[01:41:43.459 --> 01:41:52.686]  You should go to TomFlocco.com, F-L-O-C-C-O, and you'll see in the last story I did regarding the Bush, the commission is still talking about subpoenas.
[01:41:52.886 --> 01:41:54.027]  There's a quote up at the top.
[01:41:55.168 --> 01:42:04.535]  And the president has changed that quote instead of saying, if I'd have known that they were going to fly planes into buildings, he has planes into buildings in New York City.
[01:42:05.126 --> 01:42:15.068]  By the way, we've caught them going into old transcripts of speeches from two years ago and altering those, too.
[01:42:15.408 --> 01:42:18.629]  This is a chilling cover-up and takeover.
[01:42:18.689 --> 01:42:22.850]  Tom, any other key points you want to hit on about where this commission is going?
[01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:24.970]  Hold on a second.
[01:42:25.050 --> 01:42:26.710]  Will the public buy the whitewash?
[01:42:26.730 --> 01:42:27.491]  Then I want to go to calls.
[01:42:27.791 --> 01:42:28.071]  Okay.
[01:42:28.351 --> 01:42:29.151]  Count Elisa Rice.
[01:42:29.891 --> 01:42:37.356]  When she made her damage control May 16th press conference in reaction to the Bush-New headline from the New York Post, I believe.
[01:42:37.376 --> 01:42:38.377]  Yeah, she's not a good liar.
[01:42:38.417 --> 01:42:39.558]  That's why they won't let her testify.
[01:42:40.318 --> 01:42:41.299]  She had made that statement.
[01:42:41.339 --> 01:42:46.983]  Well, there was also a question, somebody said, about this issue of the Pakistani intelligence general.
[01:42:47.683 --> 01:42:54.448]  And then what they did is the CNN and the White House literally put inaudible in the transcript.
[01:42:54.748 --> 01:42:58.831]  However, there was another issue where they named the Pakistani general.
[01:42:59.437 --> 01:43:08.420]  So they put inaudible on the White House version of the transcript so that we have evidence there, and I believe that was... Now explain, for a lot of people, they don't know what you mean by Pakistani General Amud Ahmed.
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:10.821]  Give us the background on that in a nutshell.
[01:43:10.901 --> 01:43:20.644]  Quite incredibly, we were all waiting in Attorney General Powell's testimony to find out if they would ask him, Secretary of State Powell.
[01:43:22.624 --> 01:43:27.886]  He confirmed that he met with Pakistani intelligence in his follow-up question testimony that day,
[01:43:28.710 --> 01:43:30.431]  When he testified the first day.
[01:43:31.072 --> 01:43:37.855]  However, there was no mention and no one followed up and said, well, did you meet specifically with the general of the intelligence team?
[01:43:37.875 --> 01:43:39.256]  Well, obviously he inferred that.
[01:43:39.616 --> 01:43:50.783]  Well, this Pakistani intelligence general, Mahmoud Ahmad, had one of his surrogates, his associates to wire $100,000 to Mohammed Atta,
[01:43:53.177 --> 01:43:54.257]  The lead hijacker.
[01:43:54.677 --> 01:44:00.899]  And by the way, that's admitted, and then in the second trip in his life, he met with the CIA chief.
[01:44:00.979 --> 01:44:02.980]  He also met with Richard Armitage.
[01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:09.501]  And then that morning of 9-11, he was having breakfast with the House and Senate Intelligence Committee chairman.
[01:44:09.821 --> 01:44:10.441]  That is correct.
[01:44:10.461 --> 01:44:16.183]  He met with Porter Goss, and he met with Robert Graham, and also mentioned was Senator John Kyle.
[01:44:16.683 --> 01:44:19.664]  So here we have United States Congressman in charge of the
[01:44:20.737 --> 01:44:33.925]  These joint congressional intelligence investigations of 9-11, meeting with the general who had wired money to the lead hijacker a week or two prior to coming to Washington.
[01:44:33.965 --> 01:44:34.786]  Let me give them some more.
[01:44:35.466 --> 01:44:44.892]  We have a London Guardian reporting, as well as the Associated Press, that Bush Sr., a Carlyle Group function at 8.30 in the morning, was having breakfast with the head of the bin Laden family.
[01:44:45.632 --> 01:44:49.595]  We also, of course, have a bunch of other examples of this.
[01:44:50.975 --> 01:44:55.219]  Yeah, these are the kinds of things that were... See, they had opportunities.
[01:44:55.239 --> 01:44:56.640]  They could have asked this to Armitage.
[01:44:56.680 --> 01:45:00.523]  They could have asked it to Colin Powell.
[01:45:00.563 --> 01:45:02.345]  Armitage was very arrogant, wasn't he?
[01:45:03.866 --> 01:45:04.287]  You know what?
[01:45:05.488 --> 01:45:08.570]  I bet this hasn't been... I've got to report this, too, because we all walked out.
[01:45:08.630 --> 01:45:12.153]  The families and all the reporters walked out before Armitage spoke.
[01:45:12.173 --> 01:45:12.633]  Did you hear that?
[01:45:13.963 --> 01:45:14.723]  No, we didn't hear it.
[01:45:15.104 --> 01:45:15.824]  We're hearing it now.
[01:45:16.124 --> 01:45:26.328]  There was four reporters left in the room, and the room was almost empty during Armage's testimony, and no one has reported that except for a slight, slight mention that I did a Google search for it.
[01:45:26.348 --> 01:45:27.509]  But you know what I'm going to have to do?
[01:45:27.529 --> 01:45:28.449]  I'm going to have to write a story.
[01:45:28.469 --> 01:45:30.970]  I'm going to have to write the real thing, because you know what?
[01:45:31.331 --> 01:45:34.832]  And that was a protest because Rice hadn't shown up.
[01:45:35.072 --> 01:45:35.532]  That's right.
[01:45:36.033 --> 01:45:36.793]  That was a protest.
[01:45:36.813 --> 01:45:39.234]  But have you seen that on all the big news reports?
[01:45:39.975 --> 01:45:42.056]  Oh, no, the families love it and think it's great.
[01:45:42.096 --> 01:45:43.036]  Let's take calls.
[01:45:44.657 --> 01:45:45.317]  Oh, my goodness.
[01:45:45.577 --> 01:45:46.537]  Who's up first here?
[01:45:49.719 --> 01:45:51.299]  Let's talk to David in New Jersey.
[01:45:51.359 --> 01:45:52.079]  David, go ahead.
[01:45:52.099 --> 01:45:53.240]  Hello, Alex.
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:53.820]  Hello, Tom.
[01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:56.401]  Thank you, gentlemen, both, for the work that you're doing.
[01:45:57.351 --> 01:46:01.876]  Tom, I had come across an article regarding Sybil Edmonds a while back.
[01:46:01.936 --> 01:46:04.017]  I tried to retrieve the letter, but I archived it.
[01:46:04.218 --> 01:46:09.923]  And there was some mention about she had been looking over the shoulder of one of her coworkers who was mistranslating
[01:46:10.618 --> 01:46:13.660]  Some of the intercepts that she was tasked to produce.
[01:46:13.780 --> 01:46:19.324]  That is, they're going back and altering them retroactively for the committee.
[01:46:19.584 --> 01:46:23.867]  She was mistranslating them on purpose at the time.
[01:46:24.367 --> 01:46:27.269]  Well, you see, this is the story, and now she came out.
[01:46:27.876 --> 01:46:39.169]  She said that she was asked personally to change, and because she wouldn't do it, she was basically fired from her job.
[01:46:39.730 --> 01:46:46.537]  In her quotes, they offered her a bigger job to shut up or threaten to arrest her if she didn't, and that's documented.
[01:46:46.557 --> 01:46:48.380]  We covered that earlier, David.
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:49.080]  Right.
[01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:50.481]  Okay, we'll move on to another thing.
[01:46:50.521 --> 01:46:59.008]  Tom, your fax campaign, can you post any additional information as far as contacts that we can... Well, what we're going to do next on that, I've left that up there.
[01:46:59.028 --> 01:47:00.709]  Tell folks what it is.
[01:47:00.850 --> 01:47:09.676]  I didn't even talk about that, but we had Bill Douglas of the 9-11 Visibility Project and I had gotten together and talked on the phone.
[01:47:09.697 --> 01:47:10.277]  What can we do?
[01:47:10.317 --> 01:47:13.059]  And I said, well, there are basically six people.
[01:47:13.079 --> 01:47:15.081]  You've got your House and Senate leaders,
[01:47:15.821 --> 01:47:21.083]  You've got Mr. Keene of the Commission and Mr. Kerry, who has the microphone and is being covered daily.
[01:47:21.283 --> 01:47:28.667]  These people have the most power to call for a subpoena of Condoleezza Rice and the President and the Vice President, some of the key players.
[01:47:28.727 --> 01:47:31.028]  Secretary Myers was testifying, but he didn't say anything.
[01:47:31.188 --> 01:47:33.188]  So you posted their contact info.
[01:47:33.249 --> 01:47:43.833]  Yeah, and people started calling, and for about two weeks we were able to get quite a bit done in terms of getting people to call the telephone numbers and get
[01:47:46.613 --> 01:47:50.694]  Yes, exactly.
[01:47:52.474 --> 01:47:55.855]  Now we're at a point where it's basically a cover-up.
[01:47:56.435 --> 01:47:57.535]  This is a major cover-up.
[01:47:57.555 --> 01:48:06.178]  Here you have the most important investigation since Watergate anyway, and it might be the most important when you consider the number of people that died.
[01:48:06.218 --> 01:48:07.218]  Here you have a masked
[01:48:07.794 --> 01:48:12.337]  3,000 death crimes and mass murder, and you don't even have a grand jury.
[01:48:12.537 --> 01:48:15.960]  You have no career prosecutors involved in this thing.
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:19.082]  And you can tell by the questions being answered.
[01:48:19.102 --> 01:48:22.164]  You have Bush syndicate partners running the investigation.
[01:48:23.044 --> 01:48:24.645]  Well, if you want to call it that.
[01:48:24.705 --> 01:48:30.089]  Basically, the committee is so conflicted.
[01:48:30.109 --> 01:48:31.730]  It's disgusting, Al.
[01:48:32.010 --> 01:48:33.531]  All right, let's get more calls.
[01:48:33.571 --> 01:48:35.072]  Let's talk to Don in Wisconsin.
[01:48:35.092 --> 01:48:35.733]  Don, go ahead.
[01:48:36.775 --> 01:48:37.055]  Hello?
[01:48:37.615 --> 01:48:38.095]  Yes, John.
[01:48:38.675 --> 01:48:50.598]  Yeah, Mr. Jones, I just wanted to make a quick comment about the laws about the news stories that you're putting out on your website.
[01:48:52.159 --> 01:48:57.880]  If you make a copy of any news story that's broadcast on television, that's against federal law.
[01:48:59.315 --> 01:49:05.317]  It's not under fair use, and normally we just link the stories, and we're analyzing the news, sir.
[01:49:05.337 --> 01:49:07.457]  Do you have a comment or anything about these news articles?
[01:49:07.897 --> 01:49:08.958]  Well, I was just wondering.
[01:49:09.058 --> 01:49:19.341]  I heard yesterday on another show on Shortwave about an international court in the year 2000 found the Bush administration guilty of war crimes.
[01:49:22.041 --> 01:49:22.462]  Okay.
[01:49:22.662 --> 01:49:24.062]  Well, thank you for the call, Don.
[01:49:24.522 --> 01:49:26.563]  Let's talk to Dan in Illinois.
[01:49:26.603 --> 01:49:27.223]  Dan, go ahead.
[01:49:29.619 --> 01:49:30.600]  You're on the air, Dan.
[01:49:32.020 --> 01:49:32.381]  Okay.
[01:49:32.841 --> 01:49:33.061]  Alex.
[01:49:33.561 --> 01:49:34.342]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:49:34.442 --> 01:49:54.014]  You know, it's very clear that this panel is not put together to put any of the questions at rest, all the doubts, how jet fuel can melt the building, how amateur pilots can hit these needles in a haystack, or how the hole's too small in the Pentagon for a plane to hit.
[01:49:54.554 --> 01:49:55.955]  It's not put together for that at all.
[01:49:57.319 --> 01:50:02.282]  They're put together just to give the neocon followers some ammunition that they're doing something.
[01:50:03.143 --> 01:50:07.906]  Well, I spent some time at the end of the last hearing because of the rush hour.
[01:50:07.926 --> 01:50:09.187]  I wasn't going to drive home in that.
[01:50:09.667 --> 01:50:16.732]  I went out to dinner with some reporters, and there was a Philip Weirin who had spent a great deal of time researching the buildings.
[01:50:16.972 --> 01:50:19.134]  When I first looked at the buildings, I thought they were imploded.
[01:50:19.154 --> 01:50:19.874]  There's no question.
[01:50:20.255 --> 01:50:22.576]  I looked at them, and they looked like they came down straight.
[01:50:22.616 --> 01:50:23.697]  But after talking to Philip,
[01:50:24.503 --> 01:50:32.386]  Basically, he said that the buildings were built by the mob, and they were built so shoddily, and just quarter-inch pieces of steel.
[01:50:32.426 --> 01:50:34.507]  They were just pieces of plastic.
[01:50:34.867 --> 01:50:38.448]  We have the owner of the World Trade Center complex saying they blew it up.
[01:50:39.748 --> 01:50:40.749]  We have those video clips.
[01:50:41.249 --> 01:50:45.190]  There's a lot of discrepancy.
[01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:47.191]  We've got to break again, folks.
[01:50:47.231 --> 01:50:48.472]  Everybody, stay there.
[01:50:48.512 --> 01:50:49.312]  More calls coming up.
[01:50:49.332 --> 01:50:49.692]  Stay with us.
[01:50:51.767 --> 01:50:56.095]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:56.275 --> 01:51:00.643]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:51:02.912 --> 01:51:05.235]  Use this disaster as a new world order.
[01:51:05.355 --> 01:51:08.058]  A new world order can emerge.
[01:51:08.418 --> 01:51:12.643]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:51:12.703 --> 01:51:19.631]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:51:19.771 --> 01:51:21.794]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:51:21.994 --> 01:51:32.457]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:51:32.757 --> 01:51:38.118]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:51:38.639 --> 01:51:41.299]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[01:51:51.122 --> 01:51:53.104]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[01:51:53.184 --> 01:51:53.844]  Hello, folks.
[01:51:53.965 --> 01:52:03.913]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:52:04.273 --> 01:52:08.797]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:52:08.877 --> 01:52:20.206]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:52:20.586 --> 01:52:21.267]  We're good to go.
[01:52:35.925 --> 01:52:42.232]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:53:58.861 --> 01:54:07.106]  We got Bob Chatman of the International Forecaster, economist, former Army intelligence, to get into the Madrid bombings, what's happening with the dollar, the economy.
[01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:10.332]  Of course, we've got loaded phone lines for our guest, Tom Flocko.
[01:54:12.054 --> 01:54:22.803]  And, you know, some of the callers, I mean, you can talk about whatever you want on the show, but, I mean, I'd like to try to keep some of the calls to 9-11 because one of the callers stumped me.
[01:54:22.823 --> 01:54:27.126]  He's like, a court in 2000 found George Bush guilty.
[01:54:27.647 --> 01:54:30.129]  I think it was a war crimes court just a few months ago did that.
[01:54:30.709 --> 01:54:34.232]  So it's pretty confusing stuff and kind of off the issue here.
[01:54:35.053 --> 01:54:35.694]  Let's see if...
[01:54:37.259 --> 01:54:40.601]  Oh, I guess who's up next here, Stephanie?
[01:54:42.023 --> 01:54:43.363]  Sandra in Atlantic City.
[01:54:43.383 --> 01:54:44.164]  Go ahead, Sandra.
[01:54:44.865 --> 01:54:45.225]  Hi.
[01:54:45.925 --> 01:54:48.307]  I was listening to the Senate this morning.
[01:54:48.347 --> 01:54:54.952]  Harry Reid said that there were 100 security meetings before 9-1-1, and only two of them terrorism was mentioned.
[01:54:55.552 --> 01:55:02.837]  Also, I live about three miles from the FAA Center at the Tech Center in Pomona, New Jersey.
[01:55:03.418 --> 01:55:06.220]  I don't think it would have taken those planes very long to get up there.
[01:55:06.519 --> 01:55:08.680]  They sure can make it down to D.C.
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:11.682]  every day to guard the President.
[01:55:12.182 --> 01:55:13.142]  And that's it.
[01:55:13.282 --> 01:55:13.703]  Thank you.
[01:55:14.283 --> 01:55:14.883]  Thanks for the call.
[01:55:14.903 --> 01:55:15.844]  That's a good point, Tom.
[01:55:16.004 --> 01:55:35.153]  Well, Sandra's right on, and I know where Pomona is, and I know where the Atlantic City, that's where the 177th Fighter Wing, and I knew General Girard personally and had associated with him because he was the Commanding General of the New Jersey National Guard when I was in the
[01:55:35.726 --> 01:55:37.867]  I've been with the National Guard back for so many years.
[01:55:38.428 --> 01:55:56.759]  On that day, I heard Chairman Tom Keene, who was also the governor of the state of New Jersey, who was the governor, and he had said on C-SPAN one morning that a caller had called in and talked about the same thing Sandra said.
[01:55:57.319 --> 01:56:03.603]  He said, well, we were looking outward and somebody asked a question to him about why
[01:56:04.062 --> 01:56:07.267]  They couldn't have done something about escorting the planes or shooting them down or something.
[01:56:07.287 --> 01:56:10.732]  But when another plane goes off, in just a few minutes it's surrounded.
[01:56:10.952 --> 01:56:11.853]  Yes, exactly.
[01:56:12.013 --> 01:56:13.776]  And it's a standard procedure.
[01:56:13.816 --> 01:56:16.520]  And we've put the notification of the hijacking.
[01:56:16.540 --> 01:56:18.463]  But there were planes in the air, Alex.
[01:56:18.934 --> 01:56:20.275]  Operation Vigilant Guardian.
[01:56:20.295 --> 01:56:24.298]  There were training missions up and down the East Coast with fire jets.
[01:56:24.358 --> 01:56:24.978]  It's a fraud.
[01:56:25.018 --> 01:56:26.639]  People need to investigate it further.
[01:56:26.739 --> 01:56:28.280]  TomFlocko.com.
[01:56:29.001 --> 01:56:30.482]  We really appreciate you coming on.
[01:56:30.502 --> 01:56:32.883]  We'll have you back up on the show, and thanks for covering these hearings.
[01:56:33.023 --> 01:56:33.764]  Alex, take care.
[01:56:33.884 --> 01:56:37.166]  And send me, if you could, TomFlocko at CS.com.
[01:56:37.206 --> 01:56:42.390]  Send me the information about the two people that grabbed Mr. Bush when he was talking about the...
[01:56:43.569 --> 01:56:44.670]  You know, the remote control.
[01:56:44.930 --> 01:56:45.530]  I'd love to see those.
[01:56:45.550 --> 01:56:46.871]  You know, I have that on tape somewhere.
[01:56:46.911 --> 01:56:47.992]  I was taping when it happened.
[01:56:48.012 --> 01:56:51.674]  He said, you know, we can land these planes with remote control, and somebody reached out and grabbed his arm.
[01:56:52.034 --> 01:56:54.395]  Yeah, could you get Violet to send me that?
[01:56:54.475 --> 01:56:58.538]  Well, like I said, I have a literal room full of videotapes, but we're going to be going back through those.
[01:56:58.858 --> 01:56:59.758]  Tom, thanks for the call.
[01:57:00.018 --> 01:57:00.719]  Thanks, bye-bye.
[01:57:00.879 --> 01:57:01.139]  You bet.
[01:57:01.159 --> 01:57:03.240]  I really appreciate the call and you coming on the show.
[01:57:03.660 --> 01:57:05.021]  All right, we're out of time for this hour.
[01:57:05.041 --> 01:57:07.843]  We'll come back, take more calls, get to our next guest, cover a bunch of other news.

[01:58:30.334 --> 01:58:35.701]  We've got a guest coming up talking about the economy, the grid bombings, and a bunch of other news we haven't even gotten to.
[01:58:35.741 --> 01:58:37.743]  So we'll get to all your calls and a guest.
[01:58:37.763 --> 01:58:38.945]  When we get back, stay with us.
[01:58:38.965 --> 01:58:39.866]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:58:42.521 --> 01:58:53.247]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:58:53.427 --> 01:59:01.032]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:59:01.272 --> 01:59:04.414]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:59:04.674 --> 01:59:10.417]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:59:10.717 --> 01:59:11.698]  Made of durable Lexan,
[01:59:11.858 --> 01:59:16.881]  The material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:59:17.222 --> 01:59:21.104]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:59:21.164 --> 01:59:23.065]  The water level is always visible.
[01:59:23.245 --> 01:59:29.189]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:59:29.409 --> 01:59:33.372]  Get the Berkey light, a transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:59:33.392 --> 01:59:33.952]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:59:48.163 --> 01:59:48.824]  Big Brother.
[01:59:49.464 --> 01:59:50.565]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:51.246 --> 01:59:52.367]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:52.387 --> 01:59:53.828]  You want answers?
[01:59:54.569 --> 01:59:55.450]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:55.470 --> 01:59:59.934]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:00.314 --> 02:00:04.398]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:08.116 --> 02:00:09.157]  All right, my friends.
[02:00:09.277 --> 02:00:13.539]  Now into the third and final hour of this global transmission on this Friday.
[02:00:13.559 --> 02:00:16.901]  We'll do the show 11 to 2 during the day, central, back from 9 to midnight.
[02:00:18.122 --> 02:00:18.602]  Central.
[02:00:20.143 --> 02:00:23.846]  Bob Chapman, you know, has degrees in economics.
[02:00:23.926 --> 02:00:27.248]  He's done incredible forecasts of what's going to happen in the markets.
[02:00:27.448 --> 02:00:29.129]  Made the federal government very mad at him.
[02:00:29.189 --> 02:00:31.730]  Exposed their suppression of the gold market.
[02:00:31.750 --> 02:00:32.611]  Done a lot of great work.
[02:00:32.731 --> 02:00:34.052]  Also was in Army Intelligence.
[02:00:35.766 --> 02:00:41.727]  And I respect his opinion, and we haven't had him on in four or five months, so I wanted to get Bob back up on the show.
[02:00:41.747 --> 02:00:44.008]  We'll also get to your calls early in this interview.
[02:00:44.028 --> 02:00:54.510]  I wanted to get him up to talk about the 9-11 Whitewash Commission, his take on that, what he sees happening with the Madrid bombings, with government fingerprints all over it, what's going on with the economy.
[02:00:55.130 --> 02:00:56.871]  And Bob, good to have you on the show.
[02:00:57.471 --> 02:00:58.771]  It's very nice being back again.
[02:01:00.241 --> 02:01:16.250]  What do you think of, I mean, let's just get into, since we just talked about 9-11, I mean, the fraud, the lies there, what clearly happened there, the police state that's being set up, this whitewashed commission with all these business connections, and to the Bush administration, your take on that?
[02:01:17.491 --> 02:01:22.514]  Well, it's another whitewash, just like the commission on the Kennedy assassination.
[02:01:23.454 --> 02:01:28.157]  And as you say, the people who are involved in the commission are corrupt,
[02:01:28.655 --> 02:01:37.440]  Council on Foreign Relations stalwarts, if you may, part of the elitists, and nothing's going to happen, nothing's going to come out, and that's the end of that.
[02:01:37.720 --> 02:01:47.405]  And we know who did it, which is, you know, the Bush and the neocons, that is 9-11, and we just have to keep on hammering away at them.
[02:01:48.526 --> 02:01:57.991]  And as far as Madrid is concerned, and my latest issue which came out yesterday, I said that I thought it was a black ops operation.
[02:01:59.089 --> 02:02:06.133]  It was too well run for a group of itinerant Moroccans to have executed that in that fashion.
[02:02:08.394 --> 02:02:25.463]  Well, I want to go over some of that a little bit later in the show or in 10 or 15 minutes or so, but first off, the economy, the plunging dollar, what's happening with Bush saying that exporting more jobs is good, it's going to get seven times worse, they're saying, Congressional Budget Office, your take on that?
[02:02:26.468 --> 02:02:38.092]  Well, first of all, outsourcing of individual jobs and outsourcing of companies, mainly manufacturing here too far, is an absolute disaster for the United States.
[02:02:38.893 --> 02:02:41.834]  And it continues to expedite every single day.
[02:02:42.714 --> 02:02:47.536]  And it's like in the war, the guy next to you is the one that's going to get shot, not you.
[02:02:48.116 --> 02:02:49.297]  Well, let me tell you something.
[02:02:49.357 --> 02:02:55.579]  If we continue to allow this outsourcing and we continue to allow free trade...
[02:02:56.263 --> 02:03:00.245]  Yeah, because now we're not just losing the high-tech jobs or the factory jobs.
[02:03:00.265 --> 02:03:01.446]  Now it's the cheeseburger jobs.
[02:03:01.466 --> 02:03:02.406]  It's everything's going.
[02:03:03.327 --> 02:03:06.428]  And Americans just don't understand what's being done to them.
[02:03:24.887 --> 02:03:26.888]  And every politician in Washington knows them.
[02:03:27.089 --> 02:03:32.372]  The 15% who are decent, don't have a voice, and the rest of them all vote together as a group.
[02:03:33.293 --> 02:03:38.597]  And so we don't have any representation to any great extent in Washington.
[02:03:38.677 --> 02:03:42.960]  Nobody wants to stop what's going on because they're all getting paid one way or the other.
[02:03:43.720 --> 02:03:45.622]  Except, you know, just a few.
[02:03:45.642 --> 02:03:49.505]  Well, that's what's happening, and...
[02:03:51.155 --> 02:04:06.042]  I want to go over some of the details of it and what it will be like living in a third world police state, but I'm sure you saw Bush a month ago, his economic commission tried to claim that hamburger, fast food jobs should be durable, good jobs.
[02:04:06.122 --> 02:04:06.823]  Manufacturing.
[02:04:07.243 --> 02:04:08.524]  Considered manufacturing.
[02:04:09.184 --> 02:04:19.129]  Well, they figure, you know, the Goebbels theory, you keep on telling a lie long enough, and if it's big enough and unbelievable enough, they'll believe it.
[02:04:20.331 --> 02:04:25.496]  And obviously, half the population in the United States more or less believes it.
[02:04:25.536 --> 02:04:30.021]  Just like they believe in this make-believe war that they're having over there.
[02:04:31.382 --> 02:04:39.670]  In my publication, The International Forecaster, I said four years ago... Tell us what you said four years ago when we get back, Bob.
[02:04:40.110 --> 02:04:40.871]  Honored to have you.
[02:04:40.891 --> 02:04:41.632]  Stay with us, folks.

[02:05:40.014 --> 02:05:42.475]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[02:05:43.396 --> 02:05:50.220]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny on DVD.
[02:05:50.540 --> 02:05:51.901]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:05:52.121 --> 02:05:53.301]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:05:54.462 --> 02:05:56.544]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:05:56.824 --> 02:06:01.788]  If you want to wake up your friends and families with the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:06:02.108 --> 02:06:06.151]  The Road of Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:06:06.391 --> 02:06:08.173]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:06:08.233 --> 02:06:13.797]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control program,
[02:06:13.957 --> 02:06:18.879]  The cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:06:19.019 --> 02:06:20.940]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:24.981]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns of the Infowars.

[02:06:42.614 --> 02:06:44.195]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:06:44.576 --> 02:06:50.320]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:06:50.580 --> 02:06:55.704]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:06:56.045 --> 02:07:05.332]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:07:05.672 --> 02:07:10.654]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:07:10.954 --> 02:07:14.956]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:07:15.176 --> 02:07:19.918]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:07:20.298 --> 02:07:26.200]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[02:07:26.540 --> 02:07:35.585]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:07:35.765 --> 02:07:39.287]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[02:07:39.848 --> 02:07:40.988]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:07:48.053 --> 02:07:48.693]  Big Brother.
[02:07:49.353 --> 02:07:50.474]  Mainstream media.
[02:07:51.134 --> 02:07:52.295]  Government cover-ups.
[02:07:52.315 --> 02:07:53.676]  You want answers?
[02:07:54.455 --> 02:07:55.316]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:55.336 --> 02:07:59.598]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:00.199 --> 02:08:04.281]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:08.564 --> 02:08:19.891]  All right, folks, we're talking to Bob Chapman, economist, also was in military intelligence, had a lot of predictions, a lot of really important information.
[02:08:21.636 --> 02:08:24.818]  And Bob, you were making a point before we hit the last break.
[02:08:25.138 --> 02:08:36.163]  About four years ago, when I told everybody to get out of the stock market right at the top, I also told them that to go into the gold and silver area and buy the shares and the coins and the bullion.
[02:08:37.023 --> 02:08:45.908]  And I also said that in order to cover up the coming crash in the American economy and the world economy, that they would have to have perpetual wars for perpetual peace.
[02:08:46.388 --> 02:08:48.769]  And I told them that the war would be in the Middle East.
[02:08:50.110 --> 02:08:50.590]  I also...
[02:08:51.478 --> 02:09:00.748]  I projected the infamous 9-11 about nine months before it happened, although I didn't know where it was going to happen.
[02:09:00.929 --> 02:09:03.692]  I've got a pretty good handle on what these people are doing.
[02:09:04.472 --> 02:09:12.221]  The reason they went into the Middle East was not only to cover the economic conditions which have been going on since then,
[02:09:12.728 --> 02:09:22.172]  But also, they wanted the oil, and they wanted the geopolitical position, the entire area also outflanking Russia on their southeastern flank.
[02:09:22.212 --> 02:09:24.153]  And the Rome PNAC documents say that.
[02:09:24.193 --> 02:09:32.116]  It's not like we're... They point at Paul O'Neill and others that have gone public that day one they plan to invade Iraq and Energy Commission maps of the oil.
[02:09:32.396 --> 02:09:34.377]  They go, oh, well, he's just angry because he got fired.
[02:09:34.617 --> 02:09:35.917]  We have the PNAC documents.
[02:09:35.957 --> 02:09:37.258]  Forget what O'Neill's saying.
[02:09:37.638 --> 02:09:38.118]  That's right.
[02:09:39.359 --> 02:09:42.380]  And so this is all part of the syndrome.
[02:09:43.212 --> 02:09:46.094]  That leads us into the fulcrum that we're in.
[02:09:46.114 --> 02:09:47.375]  Well, we have a mass looting.
[02:09:48.015 --> 02:09:49.556]  $1.2 trillion missing from the Pentagon.
[02:09:49.576 --> 02:09:51.257]  $45 trillion debt.
[02:09:51.297 --> 02:09:52.418]  That's Dallas Morning News.
[02:09:52.978 --> 02:09:57.401]  All this stuff going on, and they're just robbing and looting and no bids allowed in Iraq.
[02:09:57.782 --> 02:09:59.643]  I mean, this is full-scale criminality.
[02:10:00.243 --> 02:10:03.365]  Absolutely, and they continue to do it, and Congress does nothing.
[02:10:04.426 --> 02:10:05.707]  And then you have the markets.
[02:10:06.407 --> 02:10:12.391]  Every single day, the Plunge Protection Team, which is the working group in financial markets, which is run by...
[02:10:12.987 --> 02:10:20.610]  The president, Mr. Greenspan, the head of the New York Fed, the head of the SEC, the CFTC, and the U.S.
[02:10:20.650 --> 02:10:21.530]  Treasury Department.
[02:10:21.870 --> 02:10:31.633]  And they have their people 24 hours a day rigging, not only in the New York Stock Exchange, but in the gold and silver markets and in the currency markets in particular.
[02:10:31.653 --> 02:10:35.054]  Well, admitted, but you tell the average even economist this, they don't know it.
[02:10:35.555 --> 02:10:36.855]  Well, they don't want to know it.
[02:10:37.235 --> 02:10:38.356]  And it's the same with the public.
[02:10:38.376 --> 02:10:39.456]  They keep on pouring money.
[02:10:40.149 --> 02:10:42.630]  Into the 401K so that they can retire.
[02:10:42.650 --> 02:10:46.090]  There ain't going to be anything there because this market is going down.
[02:10:46.110 --> 02:10:49.471]  And it'll happen next year, maybe even sooner.
[02:10:49.891 --> 02:10:52.251]  And what it does, it's not going to stop at $72.63.
[02:10:52.411 --> 02:10:55.212]  It's going down to $4,000 or $5,000 or $3,000.
[02:10:56.612 --> 02:11:04.854]  And that means that the people who have saved in those vehicles for retirement, the money's not going to be there and the pension funds are going to be insolvent.
[02:11:07.688 --> 02:11:13.809]  Now, Bush comes out and says hamburger jobs are manufacturing, exporting jobs is good, is commissioning.
[02:11:14.489 --> 02:11:17.690]  I mean, how are the yuppies still buying all of this?
[02:11:19.230 --> 02:11:22.031]  They still go on their merry way and say debt is great.
[02:11:24.012 --> 02:11:27.092]  I mean, that's their total take on the thing.
[02:11:27.292 --> 02:11:35.454]  Four years ago, Bob, the summit there in Switzerland, the World Economic Forum,
[02:11:36.218 --> 02:11:43.200]  They said, we're going to plunge the dollar, we're going to bring up the euro, then we're going to use that as pressure to make America go to a Pan-American Union.
[02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:45.200]  I mean, they're gearing this thing up.
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:47.521]  Why does the elite want to get rid of the middle class?
[02:11:47.581 --> 02:11:48.421]  What's the big plan?
[02:11:48.621 --> 02:11:51.262]  What will life be like in ten years if they succeed?
[02:11:51.742 --> 02:11:52.822]  They want a world government.
[02:11:53.423 --> 02:11:57.003]  And they want a world government where everybody will be subservient.
[02:11:57.524 --> 02:11:58.884]  The United States has been...
[02:11:59.682 --> 02:12:02.543]  And could continue to be the number one nation in the world.
[02:12:03.043 --> 02:12:03.283]  Why?
[02:12:03.343 --> 02:12:06.765]  Because of our industriousness and technology, etc.
[02:12:07.265 --> 02:12:16.228]  And this is a deliberate attempt by the elitists throughout the world, and particularly in the United States, to bring down the American economy.
[02:12:17.389 --> 02:12:27.692]  This depression that we're going into, these jobs leaving the country, these illegal angels continuing to come over the border every day, this didn't happen by chance, it's by plan.
[02:12:28.093 --> 02:12:28.933]  As you pointed out,
[02:12:29.366 --> 02:12:32.327]  They want to pass FTAA by January of next year.
[02:12:32.867 --> 02:12:38.768]  Once they do that, they'll have one union all the way from the tip of the North Pole to Tierra del Fuego.
[02:12:39.769 --> 02:12:46.050]  And they want to have a world government unit for North, South, Central America and Mexico.
[02:12:46.390 --> 02:12:48.131]  The same thing has already been done in Europe.
[02:12:48.571 --> 02:12:53.352]  And after they have units like that all over the world, they will amalgamate into their world government.
[02:12:53.652 --> 02:12:56.313]  And at the same time, the United States, they hope,
[02:12:56.789 --> 02:13:02.411]  will be so fundamentally financially on their back that they won't do anything about it.
[02:13:02.491 --> 02:13:05.132]  I'm talking about the American people.
[02:13:06.773 --> 02:13:10.394]  They know that poor serfs, it's harder for them to resist.
[02:13:11.195 --> 02:13:16.517]  There's only one fly in the ointment for the conspiracy that's doing this.
[02:13:17.357 --> 02:13:22.939]  And that is, number one, they haven't got the weapons away from the American public.
[02:13:23.580 --> 02:13:26.541]  And as long as they're there, they can't take the country over.
[02:13:27.094 --> 02:13:31.615]  And they know there's people like you and I out there who are telling people the truth.
[02:13:32.355 --> 02:13:37.016]  And those who are listening are going to hide what they have and use them if they have to.
[02:13:40.036 --> 02:13:40.777]  Absolutely.
[02:13:40.877 --> 02:13:42.757]  And they're trying to brainwash our police.
[02:13:42.797 --> 02:13:44.837]  They're telling us secret arrest is good.
[02:13:44.957 --> 02:13:47.518]  The Pentagon's putting on a fake newscast.
[02:13:47.618 --> 02:13:49.818]  I mean, it is Orwellian to the max.
[02:13:50.418 --> 02:13:51.178]  Absolutely.
[02:13:51.399 --> 02:13:53.679]  And from your military intelligence training and study,
[02:13:54.649 --> 02:14:03.615]  I mean, do you think the troops will go along with this, or will they need a terror event during the deepening depression as a way to unify us behind the plastic Chinese flag?
[02:14:04.395 --> 02:14:05.316]  Well, two things.
[02:14:05.376 --> 02:14:16.803]  Number one, I expect that if Mr. Bush feels that he's not going to be re-elected, there will be terrorist events in the United States, which will be done by his and the neocons' black ops teams.
[02:14:16.923 --> 02:14:17.624]  That's number one.
[02:14:18.144 --> 02:14:21.026]  I picked out five major cities with heavy Jewish populations.
[02:14:21.647 --> 02:14:27.209]  New York, Miami, Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles are all potential victims.
[02:14:27.729 --> 02:14:29.270]  Oh, you think they'll kill a bunch of Jews?
[02:14:29.950 --> 02:14:31.710]  Well, they'll kill a bunch of people.
[02:14:31.730 --> 02:14:33.791]  They might even use small nuclear devices.
[02:14:34.171 --> 02:14:37.832]  And then say it was Arabs targeting Jews.
[02:14:38.192 --> 02:14:38.793]  Exactly.
[02:14:39.233 --> 02:14:45.935]  And we'll have plenty of Arabs who they'll put up front to take the blame for it, supposedly.
[02:14:48.203 --> 02:14:49.924]  That's where I think that is headed.
[02:14:50.324 --> 02:14:55.866]  A precursor to that was what they just did in Spain when he had backfired on them.
[02:14:56.046 --> 02:14:57.466]  Let's spend a few minutes on Spain.
[02:14:57.586 --> 02:14:58.587]  It's in your new issue.
[02:14:58.847 --> 02:15:02.148]  We'll tell folks how to get a free sample copy of it here in a few minutes.
[02:15:02.828 --> 02:15:07.329]  These are incredible information that Bob puts together.
[02:15:07.790 --> 02:15:08.830]  Bob, break it down for us.
[02:15:08.870 --> 02:15:09.730]  What happened in Madrid?
[02:15:11.891 --> 02:15:13.831]  Everybody has seen the reports of the bombings.
[02:15:14.432 --> 02:15:15.232]  The question is,
[02:15:16.286 --> 02:15:22.650]  And the important question is, how did these people get a hold of what they had, number one, under the circumstances?
[02:15:22.690 --> 02:15:25.632]  And now it's Spanish military explosives, by the way.
[02:15:26.093 --> 02:15:26.653]  That's right.
[02:15:27.013 --> 02:15:29.215]  And the timing involved.
[02:15:29.935 --> 02:15:32.897]  The timing was absolutely perfect.
[02:15:33.217 --> 02:15:35.919]  It was the same way 9-11 was done.
[02:15:35.979 --> 02:15:43.424]  This was done by ultra-professionals, not a group of terrorist militants.
[02:15:43.484 --> 02:15:44.305]  It's impossible.
[02:15:44.884 --> 02:15:49.907]  I mean, these people who did this spent their whole life training to do this.
[02:15:50.367 --> 02:15:59.113]  Then they tried to blame a Basque, I mean, literal goat herders from the mountains, when the Basques have never done anything, you know, a tenth this big.
[02:15:59.513 --> 02:16:02.175]  And then they had to admit it wasn't the Basques, and, oh, it's Al-Qaeda.
[02:16:02.415 --> 02:16:07.498]  Turns out the Al-Qaeda group they talked about doesn't exist, but is some weird CIA front group.
[02:16:08.639 --> 02:16:08.879]  Mm-hmm.
[02:16:10.017 --> 02:16:14.681]  Well, we know it's a put-up job, and that's the bottom line, and that's the important thing.
[02:16:15.161 --> 02:16:21.546]  And if I am right, and it's a precursor to something in the United States, then we get some real problems.
[02:16:22.467 --> 02:16:32.295]  I think that the people who are running George Bush, I do not think they want him to run for president, nor do I think they want him to win.
[02:16:34.237 --> 02:16:37.900]  And I think he's made such a mess out of this, he's lost such credibility.
[02:16:38.664 --> 02:16:39.445]  Among the people.
[02:16:39.465 --> 02:16:42.446]  That they may put his cousin John Forbes Carey in.
[02:16:42.867 --> 02:16:43.487]  That's right.
[02:16:43.807 --> 02:16:49.131]  Or, if he doesn't want to go peacefully, I think there could be an assassination.
[02:16:51.192 --> 02:16:52.933]  If you don't get out of the way, they get rid of you.
[02:16:53.273 --> 02:16:55.815]  Well, I hope that doesn't happen because Bush is just a puppet.
[02:16:56.295 --> 02:16:57.856]  That's right, but that's not the point.
[02:16:57.916 --> 02:16:58.557]  They don't care.
[02:16:58.597 --> 02:16:59.697]  They do what they want to do.
[02:17:00.218 --> 02:17:05.181]  And if you notice, you have all these little events coming out now, particularly three days ago.
[02:17:06.170 --> 02:17:12.192]  Goldman Sachs chief economist came out and essentially said that all the figures coming out of the United States government are lies.
[02:17:13.573 --> 02:17:17.074]  This is about CPI, PPI, and on and on and on.
[02:17:17.994 --> 02:17:20.575]  Now, that's a political statement.
[02:17:21.275 --> 02:17:27.377]  So they've got the big guns out after him, and Goldman Sachs is an elitist company.
[02:17:29.918 --> 02:17:34.000]  So you think the elite think that Bush hasn't been a good puppet and they want Kerry in?
[02:17:34.500 --> 02:17:34.940]  That's right.
[02:17:35.928 --> 02:17:39.110]  He's made a mess of things because they wanted to take out Iran and Syria.
[02:17:39.771 --> 02:17:58.304]  In fact, the Jerusalem Post this morning said that the rumors are over there that Rumsfeld wants to go after Hezbollah, which is housed in Lebanon and on the border of Syria, so they can draw the Syrian troops in so they can go in and smash them.
[02:17:58.904 --> 02:18:02.967]  Well, they put out official reports where Rumsfeld's advocating the invasion of Syria.
[02:18:03.888 --> 02:18:05.269]  Well, this was just the latest one.
[02:18:05.794 --> 02:18:06.154]  Wow.
[02:18:07.335 --> 02:18:10.816]  And these people are out of their minds.
[02:18:12.436 --> 02:18:22.139]  Well, that's what the Pentagon, even ten years ago, I've had former Republicans, former top advisors for Reagan on, saying that they called the current group the, quote, crazies.
[02:18:23.419 --> 02:18:25.480]  Well, that's a good name for them.
[02:18:25.820 --> 02:18:30.422]  Incidentally, I was on Reagan's Speakers Bureau when he first ran for governor in California.
[02:18:30.442 --> 02:18:31.902]  I used to travel all over the place with him.
[02:18:34.016 --> 02:18:35.918]  Well, it's amazing the stuff that's going on, Bob.
[02:18:35.938 --> 02:18:41.502]  There's so many other issues I want to cover and people that want to talk to you, but what are some of the things you want to talk about in the next 40 minutes?
[02:18:42.303 --> 02:18:47.106]  Well, I think the important thing is where is the economy going and how people can protect themselves.
[02:18:47.927 --> 02:18:50.949]  I think that's the most important thing from my perspective.
[02:18:51.710 --> 02:18:54.472]  All the other things lend to it.
[02:18:54.912 --> 02:19:02.138]  It's like a part of a mosaic, and you've got to put it all together to come up with a synthesis.
[02:19:02.765 --> 02:19:10.631]  And that's why people subscribe to the International Forecaster and read 30 or 40 pages every week to find out really what's going on out there.
[02:19:11.111 --> 02:19:14.493]  And there are other good publications, too, but not very many of them.
[02:19:15.074 --> 02:19:30.605]  And read books like Don Grandpre's three books on the subject of 9-11, which I recommend in my publication, and books like Ed Griffith's Creature from Jekyll Island and Dr. Stanley Monti's The Brotherhood of Darkness.
[02:19:31.390 --> 02:19:31.952]  Absolutely.
[02:19:31.972 --> 02:19:32.674]  We've got a break.
[02:19:32.695 --> 02:19:35.284]  We'll come back, take calls, and get more into the economy.
[02:19:35.304 --> 02:19:36.187]  Everybody stay with us.
[02:19:39.585 --> 02:19:41.946]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:19:42.207 --> 02:19:46.029]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:19:46.369 --> 02:19:47.170]  Read the labels.
[02:19:47.610 --> 02:19:51.732]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:19:51.952 --> 02:19:56.135]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:19:56.515 --> 02:20:01.398]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:20:01.778 --> 02:20:05.340]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:20:05.541 --> 02:20:10.884]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:20:11.164 --> 02:20:13.886]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:20:14.186 --> 02:20:15.087]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:20:41.341 --> 02:20:45.643]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[02:20:46.043 --> 02:20:46.904]  It still is.
[02:20:47.544 --> 02:20:51.006]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[02:20:51.366 --> 02:20:53.147]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[02:20:53.727 --> 02:20:55.748]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[02:20:56.331 --> 02:20:58.352]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[02:20:58.733 --> 02:21:06.378]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[02:21:06.778 --> 02:21:10.541]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.

[02:21:39.111 --> 02:21:47.738]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:21:47.958 --> 02:21:59.228]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:21:59.448 --> 02:22:02.090]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:22:02.430 --> 02:22:08.895]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:22:09.055 --> 02:22:10.936]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:22:11.116 --> 02:22:17.141]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:22:17.401 --> 02:22:23.065]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[02:22:28.068 --> 02:22:28.748]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:22:41.474 --> 02:22:46.958]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:22:47.398 --> 02:22:51.621]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:22:51.861 --> 02:22:58.906]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:22:59.287 --> 02:23:05.391]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:23:05.531 --> 02:23:06.752]  There are no side effects.
[02:23:06.952 --> 02:23:07.392]  We're good to go.
[02:23:23.866 --> 02:23:26.989]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[02:23:27.009 --> 02:23:27.109]  866-885-6625.

[02:23:27.409 --> 02:23:28.210]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:23:28.270 --> 02:23:28.570]  Call today.
[02:23:28.810 --> 02:23:31.773]  Oh, I tell you, when there's this much information...
[02:23:47.069 --> 02:23:48.089]  It gives you a headache.
[02:23:48.530 --> 02:23:54.291]  But bottom line, there is mass criminal looting taking place at every level of government.
[02:23:54.311 --> 02:23:56.532]  This is the normal pattern throughout history.
[02:23:57.152 --> 02:23:58.153]  And it's happening again.
[02:23:58.633 --> 02:24:00.013]  What do we do to stop it?
[02:24:00.473 --> 02:24:01.954]  Number one, we get out of debt.
[02:24:01.974 --> 02:24:03.374]  We stop being dependent on the government.
[02:24:03.915 --> 02:24:10.677]  We develop cadres of people in your area that understand what's going on, who work for liberty and freedom.
[02:24:11.197 --> 02:24:12.297]  It's a process.
[02:24:12.457 --> 02:24:14.058]  And we're not going to defeat this overnight.
[02:24:14.919 --> 02:24:19.322]  But I have to tell you, Mr. Chapman, I see fear in the globalist's eyes.
[02:24:19.342 --> 02:24:21.223]  I don't see as much arrogance as I did.
[02:24:21.563 --> 02:24:24.325]  I'm seeing a massive awakening taking place right now.
[02:24:25.946 --> 02:24:32.911]  What's your forecast long-term on defeating this current gaggle of global crooks?
[02:24:33.671 --> 02:24:42.357]  Well, first of all, I think that you're correct in stating that these elitists, as I call them, are getting very nervous.
[02:24:43.380 --> 02:24:53.808]  Because things haven't been turning out the way that they would have liked them to, and they haven't had the success that they had envisioned with what we call the neocons and Mr. Bush.
[02:24:54.389 --> 02:24:59.093]  And so your perception on that, at least as far as I'm concerned, is correct.
[02:25:00.073 --> 02:25:10.762]  When you see them in the markets every day trying to make things last as long as possible so they can get all their ducks in order and get the kind of people that they want in office,
[02:25:11.423 --> 02:25:23.326]  And you see that they continue to run into trouble because of programs like yours and newsletters throughout the Internet, which is probably the only place where you can get the truth today.
[02:25:23.486 --> 02:25:31.848]  So they do plan to implode things, but they need to get their police state control grid set up first, and so things are falling apart for them.
[02:25:32.728 --> 02:25:33.308]  That's correct.
[02:25:33.488 --> 02:25:39.490]  And the economic part is very, very important because it brings...
[02:25:40.397 --> 02:25:42.258]  People into a submissive state.
[02:25:43.059 --> 02:25:51.384]  We don't have a job and you can't pay your bills and you've been thrown out of your home and all those terrible sorts of things.
[02:25:52.024 --> 02:26:03.891]  When they start happening to lots and lots of people in the economy, and incidentally, unemployment's not 5.7%, it's about 14%, because they don't even count the people who have given up looking.
[02:26:03.931 --> 02:26:07.213]  And this goes back for years that people have given up looking.
[02:26:07.813 --> 02:26:09.174]  And so the situation now...
[02:26:09.736 --> 02:26:10.997]  It's even worse than it looks.
[02:26:11.898 --> 02:26:14.119]  Well, I mean, for those that don't understand, I'm cooking the books.
[02:26:14.179 --> 02:26:19.704]  I hate to use this three times in an hour, but they're trying to change the numbers where fast food is manufacturing.
[02:26:19.744 --> 02:26:21.185]  I mean, the numbers are cooked.
[02:26:22.086 --> 02:26:32.053]  And that's what the chief economist for Goldman Sachs said three days ago, and they probably have one of the best research departments in the world, irrespective of where they're coming from.
[02:26:34.215 --> 02:26:35.656]  They are one world, believe me.
[02:26:36.434 --> 02:26:38.376]  And this is a political thing.
[02:26:38.416 --> 02:26:39.957]  Well, aren't there different power blocks?
[02:26:39.977 --> 02:26:47.343]  You have the old line of European money that has let Bush run wild on a long leash to create havoc.
[02:26:47.383 --> 02:26:52.047]  Now they say, oh, we've got to have our liberal world government based in the EU.
[02:26:52.447 --> 02:27:00.193]  But then they blame Bush for the centralization and the oil grabbing, which they then later take over, which we see with the UN now beginning to take over Iraq.
[02:27:01.154 --> 02:27:02.535]  You're absolutely correct.
[02:27:02.856 --> 02:27:04.357]  And there are power factions.
[02:27:05.077 --> 02:27:09.019]  And they do disagree with one another as to how things should be run.
[02:27:09.659 --> 02:27:24.187]  They've got think tanks behind the scenes that spend 24 hours a day with billions and billions of dollars at their disposal and millions of people at their disposal, and they're planning day and night on how to do the things that they want to do to us.
[02:27:26.688 --> 02:27:28.229]  And that's where you get the complexity.
[02:27:29.110 --> 02:27:29.990]  The complexity.
[02:27:30.290 --> 02:27:31.771]  And people say, well, how can that be?
[02:27:33.098 --> 02:27:34.919]  It's this whole study in itself.
[02:27:35.939 --> 02:27:38.580]  Yeah, the globalists don't manufacture cars or computers.
[02:27:38.660 --> 02:27:44.922]  Their job is manipulating, dumbing down, creating false perceptions, manipulating economic trends over decades.
[02:27:45.502 --> 02:27:46.202]  Absolutely.
[02:27:46.282 --> 02:27:48.003]  And it has been going on for decades.
[02:27:48.063 --> 02:27:55.945]  As a matter of fact, I often say that both sides of every war have been financed by the same people since the 12th century.
[02:27:56.885 --> 02:27:59.666]  And people look at you like, my goodness gracious, how could that be?
[02:28:00.228 --> 02:28:00.908]  Well, it is.
[02:28:01.008 --> 02:28:02.169]  It's the same families.
[02:28:02.549 --> 02:28:04.089]  Others have been added along the way.
[02:28:04.110 --> 02:28:09.712]  The people who become Rhodes Scholars and the people who become members of the Skull and Bones.
[02:28:09.792 --> 02:28:10.872]  The servant class.
[02:28:11.732 --> 02:28:14.633]  We're the servants of the elite class.
[02:28:14.673 --> 02:28:16.234]  Well, yeah, they call them Sherpas.
[02:28:17.675 --> 02:28:18.195]  Sherpas.
[02:28:19.015 --> 02:28:20.276]  You know, like up in the Himalayas?
[02:28:20.776 --> 02:28:21.036]  Yes.
[02:28:22.016 --> 02:28:24.517]  The men who do the guiding, they call them Sherpas.
[02:28:24.937 --> 02:28:26.418]  They're appointed guides.
[02:28:28.070 --> 02:28:32.313]  And that's what Henry Kissinger always referred himself as.
[02:28:32.894 --> 02:28:35.255]  And so, yes, they're second-level people.
[02:28:35.335 --> 02:28:36.336]  So they're managers.
[02:28:36.977 --> 02:28:37.617]  Exactly.
[02:28:38.378 --> 02:28:39.979]  Managers of the conspiracy.
[02:28:42.120 --> 02:28:55.010]  And it's amazing when you look at it and you say, well, gee, how can that individual accept and become part of that when he didn't need to?
[02:28:55.509 --> 02:28:56.730]  But it's a power thing.
[02:28:57.190 --> 02:28:58.531]  It's a recognition thing.
[02:28:59.651 --> 02:29:01.552]  And there's many people who get involved.
[02:29:03.073 --> 02:29:03.553]  We'll break.
[02:29:03.593 --> 02:29:04.214]  We'll come back.
[02:29:04.274 --> 02:29:10.157]  We'll tell people on the other side of this break how to get a free copy of the International Forecaster.
[02:29:10.837 --> 02:29:13.399]  And will this free copy be the current issue on the Madrid bombing?
[02:29:13.879 --> 02:29:14.499]  Absolutely.
[02:29:14.919 --> 02:29:15.540]  Okay, good.
[02:29:16.520 --> 02:29:18.181]  Get your pens and paper ready, my friends.
[02:29:18.241 --> 02:29:19.962]  On the other side, we'll give you this toll-free number.
[02:29:20.402 --> 02:29:24.925]  And then we'll go to John and Brad and...
[02:29:25.945 --> 02:29:28.489]  Folks in Illinois and Washington, United States.
[02:29:29.671 --> 02:29:30.572]  We're on the march.
[02:29:31.053 --> 02:29:32.655]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:32.675 --> 02:29:36.281]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:39.711 --> 02:29:43.593]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:29:43.833 --> 02:29:49.275]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:29:49.535 --> 02:29:59.900]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:30:00.080 --> 02:30:04.421]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:30:04.602 --> 02:30:08.183]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine
[02:30:08.183 --> 02:30:08.423]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:30:38.191 --> 02:30:40.013]  We're good to go.
[02:30:58.831 --> 02:30:59.491]  We're good to go.
[02:30:59.511 --> 02:31:00.092]  We're good to go.
[02:31:16.078 --> 02:31:16.879]  That's silverbearcafe.com.
[02:31:16.899 --> 02:31:20.022]  Do it today and preserve this country's greatness for generations to come.
[02:31:39.139 --> 02:31:41.221]  Cool weather brings cool cars.
[02:31:41.641 --> 02:31:42.541]  I don't think so.
[02:31:42.862 --> 02:31:46.484]  A cooling system can run too hot or too cold if not prepared for winter.
[02:31:46.865 --> 02:31:47.885]  Here's your to-do.
[02:31:48.105 --> 02:31:50.867]  Ask your local shop to perform the BG Coolant Flush.
[02:31:51.068 --> 02:31:56.711]  A simple test strip tells if your coolant's protecting the engine from temperature extremes or breaking down and corroding.
[02:31:57.072 --> 02:32:01.235]  The BG chemistry cleans the system, then adds new coolant with conditioners.
[02:32:01.475 --> 02:32:06.298]  Ask your shop for a BG Coolant Flush or go to bgfindashop.com.
[02:32:06.538 --> 02:32:08.260]  That's bgfindashop.com.
[02:32:09.241 --> 02:32:10.301]  Find your clean shop at BGFindAShop.com.
[02:32:10.321 --> 02:32:11.261]  That's BGFindAShop.com.
[02:32:42.645 --> 02:32:43.125]  Don't worry.
[02:32:43.605 --> 02:32:45.126]  This show is documented.
[02:32:45.646 --> 02:32:48.407]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:32:48.807 --> 02:32:52.288]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:32:52.308 --> 02:32:56.889]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[02:32:57.389 --> 02:32:59.330]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[02:33:00.270 --> 02:33:01.651]  The ring of fire.
[02:33:02.591 --> 02:33:03.911]  The ring of fire.
[02:33:04.131 --> 02:33:06.352]  We've been changing directions a lot.
[02:33:06.372 --> 02:33:09.433]  We'll get more into the economy we're about to go through.
[02:33:11.018 --> 02:33:12.019]  A bunch of your phone calls.
[02:33:12.039 --> 02:33:19.425]  But before we do that, get your pens and paper ready, because I'll give you the number to get Bob Chapman's amazing newsletter, an issue of it, free.
[02:33:20.165 --> 02:33:24.168]  But before I do that, I've made ten films, I've written a book, I've published a book.
[02:33:25.049 --> 02:33:34.536]  We carry other great books and videos by amazing researchers at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:33:35.657 --> 02:33:38.879]  You can order via our safe, secure online shopping cart.
[02:33:40.131 --> 02:33:41.413]  Again, I've made ten films.
[02:33:41.934 --> 02:33:43.156]  I carry other videos.
[02:33:43.236 --> 02:33:44.618]  We expose who carried out 9-11.
[02:33:44.738 --> 02:33:48.444]  We expose the bizarre occult activities of the elite.
[02:33:49.065 --> 02:33:50.327]  The first hour, I aired...
[02:33:51.989 --> 02:34:03.291]  Richard Milhouse Nixon from Presidential Tapes talking about, you know, the most horrible, bleep, bleep, faggy thing you'd ever seen at Bohemian Grove where the so-called Christian conservative leaders go.
[02:34:03.311 --> 02:34:08.533]  I mean, you need to see this on video, the bizarre satanic rituals they engage in that I caught on tape.
[02:34:09.013 --> 02:34:11.233]  Now, that's in Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:34:11.273 --> 02:34:13.874]  You need to get these materials and get them out to people.
[02:34:14.454 --> 02:34:19.495]  There's a toll-free number to get the films or the books or the books on tape or the pro-gun T-shirts.
[02:34:20.334 --> 02:34:20.454]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:34:20.474 --> 02:34:24.517]  Or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:34:38.570 --> 02:34:42.194]  The videos are $25.95 a piece, all over two hours.
[02:34:42.674 --> 02:34:44.436]  Order three or more of any of the videos.
[02:34:44.456 --> 02:34:45.978]  They drop down to $20 a piece.
[02:34:46.278 --> 02:34:51.644]  That's an $18 discount on a three-tape special, $24 discount on a four-tape special, and so on.
[02:34:52.405 --> 02:34:53.646]  And it makes this show possible.
[02:34:53.706 --> 02:34:54.307]  So again, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:35:00.061 --> 02:35:02.703]  Bob Chapman, international forecaster.
[02:35:03.003 --> 02:35:05.045]  Again, just amazing information.
[02:35:05.085 --> 02:35:10.809]  You've got a lot of info on the economy, what's happening with the dollar, what's happening with gold, but also on the Madrid bombing.
[02:35:11.870 --> 02:35:13.711]  A lot of insight in this new issue.
[02:35:14.051 --> 02:35:15.793]  How do people get a free sample issue?
[02:35:16.373 --> 02:35:18.675]  Well, all I have to do is call the toll-free number, 877-479-8178.
[02:35:18.695 --> 02:35:19.896]  And I'll repeat that.
[02:35:19.916 --> 02:35:20.096]  That's 877-479-8178.
[02:35:29.309 --> 02:35:31.730]  877-479-8178, and they will send it out to you immediately.
[02:35:31.750 --> 02:35:34.350]  That's 877-479-8178, 877-479-8178, and get real insights into what's going on.
[02:35:34.370 --> 02:35:34.410]  877-479-8178.
[02:35:34.430 --> 02:35:37.571]  And we publish weekly on the Internet, and we do hard copy twice a month.
[02:35:37.591 --> 02:35:37.871]  Great.
[02:35:37.951 --> 02:35:41.092]  What are some of the other ways to sign up for it then online?
[02:35:58.681 --> 02:36:00.382]  All we have to do is email us.
[02:36:01.902 --> 02:36:03.543]  And do you have that email address for folks?
[02:36:04.023 --> 02:36:15.167]  Yeah, it's international underscore forecaster, that's F-O-R-E-C-A-S-T-E-R at yahoo.com.
[02:36:16.188 --> 02:36:16.628]  All right.
[02:36:16.868 --> 02:36:20.549]  And again, 877-479-8178.
[02:36:21.410 --> 02:36:23.410]  Let's go to some calls and we'll get more into the economy.
[02:36:24.191 --> 02:36:26.892]  Right now, let's go ahead and talk to John in Ohio.
[02:36:26.912 --> 02:36:27.812]  Thanks for holding, John.
[02:36:28.621 --> 02:36:31.322]  Yes, though I'm on the left, I have some disagreements with you.
[02:36:31.362 --> 02:36:42.384]  I totally agree with your position and others, like GlobalResearch.ca, that the neo-fascists and the Bush-Cheney gang are behind the 9-11 attacks.
[02:36:42.604 --> 02:36:52.246]  And also beyond that, I believe we've got to realize, as your previous guest shows, that the top corporate military industrial complex-owned media...
[02:36:52.871 --> 02:37:09.965]  is really part of this in covering up and trying to disguise a cover-up as an expose, limiting it to saying that this is merely laziness, incompetence, or negligence, when in fact their own reporters have recorded evidence of this collusion.
[02:37:10.405 --> 02:37:16.030]  There's other instances of this kind of cover-up of things that they know full well about.
[02:37:16.250 --> 02:37:17.471]  For instance, five years ago,
[02:37:18.010 --> 02:37:27.274]  All the media was in Cuba at a three-week tribunal that documented a 40-year war of terrorism by the United States government and the CIA against Cuba.
[02:37:27.294 --> 02:37:33.357]  Yeah, but you can't have a terrorist doing a report on terrorists, and the CIA put Fidel in and controls the left and right.
[02:37:33.597 --> 02:37:34.277]  Thanks for the call.
[02:37:34.337 --> 02:37:34.938]  Thanks for the call.
[02:37:35.518 --> 02:37:36.118]  Thanks for the call.
[02:37:36.178 --> 02:37:37.159]  Bob, you got any comments?
[02:37:38.019 --> 02:37:42.221]  Yes, I do, and I think that a lot of what the people on the left say
[02:37:42.825 --> 02:37:43.265]  It's true.
[02:37:43.345 --> 02:37:47.927]  I just think that we have to come to the middle and meet so that we can save the country.
[02:37:47.947 --> 02:37:50.989]  I don't want to hear about left-right things.
[02:37:51.069 --> 02:37:52.889]  I want to hear about saving America.
[02:37:53.290 --> 02:37:54.030]  Absolutely.
[02:37:55.771 --> 02:37:58.032]  I welcome ex-communists.
[02:37:58.372 --> 02:37:59.912]  I'll have them at my home for dinner.
[02:38:02.173 --> 02:38:03.554]  We want to get rid of the bad guys.
[02:38:05.262 --> 02:38:05.722]  That's it.
[02:38:05.842 --> 02:38:09.964]  And again, the establishment created these left-wing movements to consolidate the wealth.
[02:38:10.384 --> 02:38:20.749]  Now that they've got us addicted and domesticated to the welfare society, they're taking that away and transferring all power to the corrupt corporations that are organized crime syndicates that aren't free market.
[02:38:20.769 --> 02:38:25.972]  The commies and the socialists point at their banker bosses and say, oh look, capitalism's bad.
[02:38:26.292 --> 02:38:28.853]  No, the so-called capitalists aren't free market.
[02:38:29.113 --> 02:38:30.194]  They use government.
[02:38:30.214 --> 02:38:31.114]  It's organized crime.
[02:38:31.635 --> 02:38:32.155]  Exactly.
[02:38:32.796 --> 02:38:33.977]  Let's talk to Brad in Illinois.
[02:38:34.017 --> 02:38:34.678]  Brad, you're on the air.
[02:38:34.718 --> 02:38:35.099]  Go ahead.
[02:38:35.559 --> 02:38:36.801]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[02:38:36.841 --> 02:38:41.187]  I want to make a comment about this sham commission and then ask Bob a question.
[02:38:41.707 --> 02:38:49.538]  First of all, watching this commission and Richard Clark, I don't know, Alex, but I smell a complimentary smoke screen here.
[02:38:50.291 --> 02:38:54.675]  Yeah, ooh, I've got the big smoking gun for you just like Rowley, the FBI agent.
[02:38:54.935 --> 02:38:57.097]  Ignore all the real prior knowledge and involvement.
[02:38:57.458 --> 02:39:01.441]  Oh, you know, you guys just drop the ball because you're dumb, then make it a partisan issue.
[02:39:01.762 --> 02:39:07.667]  Yeah, you know, he was being attacked quite regularly there, and I don't understand why Mr. Clark didn't bring up at least two issues.
[02:39:08.246 --> 02:39:17.350]  Number one, where was the commander-in-chief on the morning of 9-11 when he was sitting reading a book in a Florida classroom while all this was going on instead of taking action?
[02:39:17.750 --> 02:39:27.194]  And number two, how come he didn't reveal that it was the White House itself that allowed him to print his book or publish his book at this time, not his idea?
[02:39:27.334 --> 02:39:29.115]  I just didn't understand why he didn't.
[02:39:29.235 --> 02:39:31.936]  He had the opportunity to bring those out, and he didn't.
[02:39:32.396 --> 02:39:33.577]  Shakespearean theory.
[02:39:33.597 --> 02:39:34.597]  You got a question for the guest?
[02:39:34.617 --> 02:39:35.898]  Yeah, and I have a question for Bob.
[02:39:36.898 --> 02:39:38.859]  Bob, I've got some extra cash on hand.
[02:39:38.879 --> 02:39:47.043]  Do you advise me buying numismatic gold and silver coins or playing the forex market and selling the dollar short?
[02:39:47.664 --> 02:39:49.885]  First of all, are you out of debt except for your house?
[02:39:50.525 --> 02:39:52.086]  I don't even have a debt on my house.
[02:39:52.386 --> 02:39:58.889]  Well, if that's the case then, you can afford to go and buy numismatic coins and they're a very good buy at this time.
[02:40:00.330 --> 02:40:03.131]  Forex is the foreign exchange market's
[02:40:03.740 --> 02:40:04.621]  Okay, thank you very much.
[02:40:04.661 --> 02:40:05.662]  And one more thing, Alex.
[02:40:05.682 --> 02:40:10.606]  I don't know if you watched Joe Scarborough last night, but him and Ann Coulter, I've emailed him numerous times.
[02:40:31.075 --> 02:40:32.916]  Asking if he could get you on his show.
[02:40:33.076 --> 02:40:36.037]  I would just love to see you on the Scarborough Show.
[02:40:36.137 --> 02:40:42.799]  Well, that's an ultra-liberal socialist program of phony neoconism, and I'm sure they won't, but hey, I appreciate the call.
[02:40:43.199 --> 02:40:46.821]  Speaking of Bush, again, on 9-11, he saw the first plane hit.
[02:40:47.521 --> 02:40:55.444]  Later, he... Well, at first, he said that he first found out about anything going on while reading the story to the children after the second plane hit.
[02:40:56.364 --> 02:40:58.425]  It just goes on and on, but I thought that we would...
[02:40:59.915 --> 02:41:06.676]  I don't know, re-air this clip, because this is Bush slipping up and not getting his story straight, so here that is.
[02:41:07.416 --> 02:41:14.157]  I was sitting outside the classroom waiting to go in, and I saw an airplane hit the tower.
[02:41:14.918 --> 02:41:20.879]  The TV was obviously on, and I used to fly myself, and I said, well, there's one terrible pilot.
[02:41:22.259 --> 02:41:23.039]  Interesting, Bob.
[02:41:23.059 --> 02:41:25.879]  That sounds like some bonehead talking.
[02:41:26.660 --> 02:41:27.500]  What a silly retort.
[02:41:29.786 --> 02:41:31.588]  He was not acting.
[02:41:31.628 --> 02:41:35.731]  He obviously knew ahead of time that it was going to happen.
[02:41:35.751 --> 02:41:41.115]  That was the first tip-off to me when I heard that, that all was not right.
[02:41:41.555 --> 02:41:44.638]  And the second one was when I saw them blow up the building.
[02:41:46.022 --> 02:41:50.344]  You know, professionally, I then knew it was an inside job.
[02:41:50.384 --> 02:42:02.730]  By the way, then the owner, Silverstein, who incidentally, according to the Chicago Sun-Times, a shadowy, secretive group of New York real estate owners headed by Silverstein, just bought the Sears Tower.
[02:42:03.504 --> 02:42:05.766]  Which magically, they say, is one of the new big targets.
[02:42:05.786 --> 02:42:10.409]  But Silverstein went on TV and said, oh yeah, we blew up Building 7 on 9-11.
[02:42:10.689 --> 02:42:12.090]  And there's no questions about that.
[02:42:12.890 --> 02:42:15.292]  Not now, but there certainly was then.
[02:42:15.792 --> 02:42:21.416]  But why do these nuts slip up so much and then no one calls them on it?
[02:42:21.496 --> 02:42:24.658]  Or is this like an open throwing down the gauntlet laughing at us?
[02:42:25.899 --> 02:42:30.562]  Open throwing down the gauntlet laughing at us.
[02:42:30.662 --> 02:42:32.784]  But as you said earlier in the program...
[02:42:33.331 --> 02:42:41.774]  They're getting a little nervous because shows like yours, what's on the Internet, my publication, others like it, we're really drilling them every day.
[02:42:41.794 --> 02:42:51.518]  The control isn't what they want it to be, but they do continue to operate in the markets every day.
[02:42:52.098 --> 02:42:58.000]  Gold is up $6 almost today, and they are pounding the big gold stocks.
[02:42:58.539 --> 02:43:00.721]  That is trying to hold them down, trying to keep them down.
[02:43:00.741 --> 02:43:14.350]  We'll go to some more calls here in a second, but since you bring up Bush, my point in playing these clips is that his daddy was pretty smart, former CIA director, but it's never a good sign in North Korea where the son of the leader is the next leader.
[02:43:14.810 --> 02:43:18.873]  It's never a good sign in Syria where Assad's daddy gives him power.
[02:43:19.954 --> 02:43:23.376]  This is what we face here, and the media really covers this up.
[02:43:23.977 --> 02:43:26.579]  Before 9-11, they would make fun of him for it, but...
[02:43:27.620 --> 02:43:28.060]  Now they don't.
[02:43:28.080 --> 02:43:31.643]  Here's just a couple minutes of famous Bush clips.
[02:43:31.683 --> 02:43:35.505]  And again, there are literally, literally hundreds of these.
[02:43:37.586 --> 02:43:38.527]  Here's one right now.
[02:43:38.927 --> 02:43:46.552]  And so, in my State of the Union, or my Speech of the Nation, whatever you want to call it, Speech of the Nation.
[02:43:57.359 --> 02:44:08.042]  I asked Americans to give 4,000 hours over the rest of your life of service to America.
[02:44:08.522 --> 02:44:09.383]  That's what I asked.
[02:44:10.283 --> 02:44:11.283]  I said, 4,000 hours.
[02:44:13.124 --> 02:44:22.146]  There's an old saying in Tennessee, I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee, that says, Fool me once, shame on you.
[02:44:26.323 --> 02:44:27.864]  If you fool me, you can't get fooled again.
[02:44:29.626 --> 02:44:36.331]  I was sitting outside the classroom waiting to go in, and I saw an airplane hit the tower.
[02:44:37.092 --> 02:44:43.076]  The TV was obviously on, and I used to fly myself, and I said, there's one terrible pilot.
[02:44:44.257 --> 02:44:46.899]  I think the intelligence I get is darn good intelligence.
[02:44:51.443 --> 02:44:53.685]  You're free, and freedom is beautiful.
[02:44:54.575 --> 02:45:00.441]  And, you know, it'll take time to restore chaos and order, but we will.
[02:45:02.463 --> 02:45:07.848]  There was an honest difference of opinion as to how to account for a complicated transaction.
[02:45:07.868 --> 02:45:16.737]  I want to remind you all that in order to fight and win the war, it requires an expenditure of money.
[02:45:19.316 --> 02:45:26.299]  That is commiserate with keeping a promise to our troops to make sure that they're well-paid, well-trained, well-equipped.
[02:45:30.380 --> 02:45:32.140]  You're working hard to put food on your family.
[02:45:33.041 --> 02:45:36.542]  We're working hard to put food on your family.
[02:45:37.322 --> 02:45:46.045]  It's in the interest of long-term peace in the world that we work for a free and secure and peaceful Iraq.
[02:45:46.855 --> 02:45:53.000]  A free and secure Iraq in the midst of the Middle East will have enormous historical impact.
[02:45:55.362 --> 02:45:56.162]  I just had to do that.
[02:45:56.202 --> 02:45:56.523]  I'm sorry.
[02:45:56.543 --> 02:45:57.183]  Go ahead, Bob.
[02:45:57.223 --> 02:45:57.764]  That's okay.
[02:45:57.804 --> 02:45:58.424]  He's just dumb.
[02:45:58.444 --> 02:46:13.436]  It's just as simple as that, and he does what he's told, and he hasn't done a very good job at it, not only in his speeches and his communicating, but also in the action of him and the people who they have doing the planning for him.
[02:46:14.136 --> 02:46:15.457]  They made a mess out of things.
[02:46:16.687 --> 02:46:17.227]  Well, they have.
[02:46:17.267 --> 02:46:18.348]  Let's take another call.
[02:46:18.388 --> 02:46:24.651]  Let's talk to Jay Shaw in Illinois.
[02:46:24.671 --> 02:46:25.091]  Go ahead.
[02:46:25.931 --> 02:46:26.571]  Hi, Alex.
[02:46:26.831 --> 02:46:28.452]  Thank you for getting my name correct.
[02:46:28.492 --> 02:46:29.273]  It's Jay Shaw.
[02:46:30.073 --> 02:46:31.313]  I listen to your show all the time.
[02:46:31.373 --> 02:46:32.054]  I'm calling in.
[02:46:32.194 --> 02:46:34.095]  I've been listening very much to you, Bob.
[02:46:34.535 --> 02:46:40.257]  I moved to Chicago a year ago after I graduated college and still haven't been able to find a job.
[02:46:40.938 --> 02:46:43.819]  I happen to work at Houston as a server.
[02:46:44.770 --> 02:46:53.374]  And I would say that 85% of the people that I work with have degrees and, you know, are waiting tables and underemployed.
[02:46:53.394 --> 02:46:58.197]  Well, hey, according to Bush, you've got a factory, a good high-tech job working as a waitress.
[02:46:58.857 --> 02:46:59.357]  Right, yeah.
[02:46:59.637 --> 02:47:02.519]  And that's the new economic, you know, system.
[02:47:03.279 --> 02:47:09.482]  Yeah, you know, and everything you've been playing, you know, everything that he says is such doublespeak.
[02:47:10.573 --> 02:47:14.115]  You have to think of the exact opposite.
[02:47:14.335 --> 02:47:17.357]  The government's growth has doubled under Bush.
[02:47:18.177 --> 02:47:24.701]  Campaign finance reform, open borders, he's going to sign the assault weapons ban, supercomputers in China, signed on to UNESCO.
[02:47:25.501 --> 02:47:27.082]  It goes on and on, Bob.
[02:47:27.862 --> 02:47:29.383]  Absolutely.
[02:47:29.443 --> 02:47:30.464]  I saw your SeaWorld.
[02:47:31.556 --> 02:47:36.700]  A little bulletin about how you had to get biometrically scanned at SeaWorld for $8 more.
[02:47:37.441 --> 02:47:41.124]  Well, I refuse, but yeah, if you want to get into SeaWorld, you've got to biometrically scan now.
[02:47:41.184 --> 02:47:41.424]  Bob?
[02:47:42.665 --> 02:47:50.392]  Well, I haven't gone to SeaWorld for a long, long time because my kids are in their 30s, but that is preposterous.
[02:47:51.052 --> 02:47:58.859]  But it's a tragedy that a young person or their family or a combination of both will go out and spend
[02:47:59.951 --> 02:48:06.693]  $150,000 or $200,000 educating their children, like this young lady says, and then there's no jobs for them.
[02:48:07.393 --> 02:48:12.434]  Plus, they have the bill that they have to pay back if they, in fact, borrowed money to get that education.
[02:48:13.114 --> 02:48:21.356]  It is absolutely awful, and every single day I am reporting they're exporting this job and that job.
[02:48:21.716 --> 02:48:26.757]  Now it's legal work and accounting and auditing and patent work.
[02:48:27.666 --> 02:48:31.007]  And transcription, and on and on and on.
[02:48:31.127 --> 02:48:31.988]  Government jobs.
[02:48:34.308 --> 02:48:35.529]  All kinds of jobs.
[02:48:35.829 --> 02:48:36.809]  It's got to stop.
[02:48:37.149 --> 02:48:43.512]  We have to re-elect punitive protective tariffs.
[02:48:44.112 --> 02:48:46.133]  And we've had them since the beginning of our country.
[02:48:46.573 --> 02:48:49.834]  They help make us great, and we have to get away from free trade.
[02:48:49.914 --> 02:48:53.375]  Well, so-called free trade, a bunch of these countries have the tariffs against us.
[02:48:53.395 --> 02:48:54.556]  We just don't have them against them.
[02:48:55.296 --> 02:48:55.716]  That's right.
[02:48:56.431 --> 02:49:02.957]  But we have to have a protective tariff, and we have to have the end of outsourcing.
[02:49:03.397 --> 02:49:06.500]  If you want to outsource, well, then you've got to pay the government so much money.
[02:49:06.700 --> 02:49:14.207]  All the jobs will come home, and it'll change everything, and this young lady, like so many young people, will be able to get a job.
[02:49:14.247 --> 02:49:15.568]  You know, I want to tell you another thing.
[02:49:15.989 --> 02:49:18.531]  Once you're over 40, the companies don't want you either.
[02:49:18.871 --> 02:49:19.192]  I know.
[02:49:19.212 --> 02:49:19.792]  I know.
[02:49:19.832 --> 02:49:20.473]  You can't win.
[02:49:20.493 --> 02:49:22.835]  It is really dreadful.
[02:49:23.664 --> 02:49:25.965]  Well, I don't know why you're complaining.
[02:49:26.205 --> 02:49:26.605]  Ma'am?
[02:49:27.645 --> 02:49:29.026]  I'm sorry, but I don't know why you're complaining.
[02:49:29.046 --> 02:49:32.026]  You've got a good factory high-tech job as a waitress.
[02:49:32.526 --> 02:49:41.029]  Right, which I have been doing for seven years, all through high school and college, with the thought that, you know, as soon as I get out of college, I'm going to leave this job.
[02:49:41.069 --> 02:49:42.549]  And, I mean, I'm an honor roll student.
[02:49:42.709 --> 02:49:44.770]  I'm actually trying to get into the media.
[02:49:44.790 --> 02:49:46.910]  I've done all kinds of media internships.
[02:49:46.930 --> 02:49:47.571]  I'm a writer.
[02:49:48.471 --> 02:49:52.252]  But, you know, I'm working on my sixth internship right now, where I work for free 30 hours a week,
[02:49:53.402 --> 02:49:56.226]  And I work as a waitress in the evening just trying to make it.
[02:49:56.526 --> 02:49:58.529]  And Bob, thanks for your call.
[02:49:58.569 --> 02:49:59.770]  I'm sorry to hear this is happening to you.
[02:49:59.810 --> 02:50:00.671]  Bob, it's getting worse.
[02:50:02.073 --> 02:50:03.235]  Every single day.
[02:50:03.395 --> 02:50:04.937]  And we've got to stop it.
[02:50:05.057 --> 02:50:07.360]  It's going to destroy our country.
[02:50:08.041 --> 02:50:11.145]  It's destroying our young people because they've got nowhere to go.
[02:50:12.097 --> 02:50:14.939]  And what are they doing in order to survive?
[02:50:15.239 --> 02:50:16.339]  They're using credit cards.
[02:50:16.379 --> 02:50:25.464]  So not only are they working the ones that can and can get jobs, but they're running these horrendous debt stuff because they can't make it in the amount of money that they're making.
[02:50:25.664 --> 02:50:28.026]  Okay, I'm going to give Brett and H.W.
[02:50:28.106 --> 02:50:33.269]  a few minutes here when we get back and give you that toll-free number to get a free copy of the International Forecaster.
[02:50:33.849 --> 02:50:34.309]  Stay with us.
[02:50:34.329 --> 02:50:34.909]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:34.949 --> 02:50:35.670]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:50:39.548 --> 02:50:43.893]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:50:44.093 --> 02:50:48.519]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:50:48.659 --> 02:50:53.044]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:50:53.084 --> 02:50:54.445]  The New World Order.
[02:50:56.207 --> 02:51:00.432]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:51:00.492 --> 02:51:07.420]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:51:07.560 --> 02:51:09.583]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:51:09.943 --> 02:51:20.229]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:51:20.549 --> 02:51:25.912]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:52:00.114 --> 02:52:07.000]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:52:07.020 --> 02:52:09.342]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:53:46.948 --> 02:53:54.273]  From 11 to 2 Central during the day, back from 9 to midnight, I'm here, I'm your host.
[02:53:55.734 --> 02:54:00.577]  Hope you'll call to get a free copy of the International Forecaster at 877-479-8178.
[02:54:00.597 --> 02:54:04.440]  Let's take a few final calls.
[02:54:04.560 --> 02:54:06.862]  Brett in Washington State, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:54:06.882 --> 02:54:08.803]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:54:08.843 --> 02:54:10.244]  We got cut off yesterday.
[02:54:10.264 --> 02:54:11.765]  Okay, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:54:12.526 --> 02:54:14.467]  Yes, New World Order...
[02:54:15.399 --> 02:54:17.641]  Immigration, Israel, or the economy?
[02:54:17.701 --> 02:54:20.263]  I'll give you as the honored host of the show to pick a topic.
[02:54:21.644 --> 02:54:27.329]  Well, I mean the New World Order, I mean the economy, I mean... Okay, let's go to the New World Order.
[02:54:28.450 --> 02:54:35.936]  What a perfect opportunity with what has happened in the last... What was it, three days ago when they assassinated that Hamas leader?
[02:54:35.956 --> 02:54:38.839]  Hello?
[02:54:38.879 --> 02:54:39.820]  Yeah, I'm listening to you.
[02:54:40.200 --> 02:54:42.562]  Yeah, they assassinated that Hamas leader...
[02:54:43.573 --> 02:54:55.937]  You know, Alex, if they retaliate in mass scale, and when I say mass scale, I'm talking not just tens or hundreds, but thousands dead over there, what is Israel going to retaliate with?
[02:54:56.397 --> 02:54:57.037]  Hold on.
[02:54:57.097 --> 02:54:58.518]  Israel helped found Hamas.
[02:54:58.538 --> 02:55:03.199]  That's what they want is chaos as a way to oppress the Israelis, a way to oppress the Palestinians.
[02:55:03.459 --> 02:55:04.780]  This is bigger than just Israel.
[02:55:04.820 --> 02:55:05.460]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:05.740 --> 02:55:06.780]  Comments to that?
[02:55:08.341 --> 02:55:12.522]  No, the situation, I think, is going to elevate, and it's going to get worse.
[02:55:13.618 --> 02:55:14.538]  And that's what they want.
[02:55:16.359 --> 02:55:17.259]  They want an excuse.
[02:55:17.699 --> 02:55:18.200]  That's it.
[02:55:18.480 --> 02:55:23.782]  And there was a Reuters headline that the assassination of the Hamas leader actually empowered Hamas.
[02:55:25.082 --> 02:55:26.323]  Let's talk to Mike in Illinois.
[02:55:26.363 --> 02:55:27.043]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:55:27.223 --> 02:55:28.263]  Yeah, Alex, how you doing?
[02:55:28.283 --> 02:55:28.864]  Hi to your guest.
[02:55:29.064 --> 02:55:30.924]  Alex, I just want to ask you a quick question on your guest.
[02:55:31.404 --> 02:55:32.265]  If you could comment on that.
[02:55:32.285 --> 02:55:34.285]  I talked to you a couple weeks ago about this.
[02:55:35.366 --> 02:55:37.867]  Jobs are leaving at an astronomical rate.
[02:55:38.851 --> 02:55:45.696]  I just want to ask him, now you say we've got to stop this, but are we to the point of no return right now as far as losing all these?
[02:55:45.776 --> 02:55:47.117]  Here's one thing we can do.
[02:55:48.178 --> 02:55:55.484]  There were laws, and they're ignoring them, or they've repealed them, I don't know if they've repealed them, where if there's going to be government contracts, it has to be given to Americans.
[02:55:55.864 --> 02:56:00.288]  Why, when you call for your welfare check, does the call go to India?
[02:56:00.388 --> 02:56:02.549]  Or why is IRS work being done in India?
[02:56:03.030 --> 02:56:05.872]  Jobs like Buy American, Bob?
[02:56:06.912 --> 02:56:14.880]  I think that you have to go after your congressmen and senators and just work them over and get everybody that you know to do the same thing about the issues that we're talking about.
[02:56:15.340 --> 02:56:22.307]  Otherwise, it's going into the streets, and that's the only alternative you'll ultimately have if you don't take a shot at telling them how you feel.
[02:56:23.808 --> 02:56:24.469]  It's unbelievable.
[02:56:24.489 --> 02:56:26.671]  Alex, I want to tell you, though, I was a victim of the India thing.
[02:56:27.392 --> 02:56:31.996]  I spoke to a gentleman who was actually in India giving me a customer service for a telephone company.
[02:56:34.662 --> 02:56:35.342]  It's amazing.
[02:56:36.043 --> 02:56:37.003]  Thanks for the call, Mike.
[02:56:37.904 --> 02:56:38.344]  H.W.
[02:56:38.424 --> 02:56:39.124]  in Colorado.
[02:56:39.144 --> 02:56:40.385]  You've got about 45 seconds.
[02:56:40.425 --> 02:56:40.845]  Go ahead.
[02:56:41.385 --> 02:56:42.706]  Alex, hi.
[02:56:43.246 --> 02:56:53.712]  I think you guys are ready for talking some philosophy of life because anything else doesn't make any sense anymore.
[02:56:54.292 --> 02:57:03.376]  Technology is a Trojan horse and world government forget it because it ought to be God
[02:57:04.730 --> 02:57:07.891]  That works through the six billion people.
[02:57:07.911 --> 02:57:08.991]  I hear you.
[02:57:09.011 --> 02:57:09.651]  Thanks for the call.
[02:57:10.151 --> 02:57:12.712]  I think what HW is saying is we have to change the hearts and minds.
[02:57:13.132 --> 02:57:14.493]  The change starts at home.
[02:57:15.033 --> 02:57:22.135]  If we hadn't become decadent and fat yuppies, they couldn't have gotten away with this if we would have been involved.
[02:57:22.195 --> 02:57:22.475]  Bob?
[02:57:23.095 --> 02:57:23.595]  I agree.
[02:57:24.335 --> 02:57:31.157]  But we still have to pursue as long and hard as possible, and even if it gets very, very frustrating at times.
[02:57:32.202 --> 02:57:36.005]  Well, yeah, I mean, if we weren't here fighting this and exposing this, things would be a lot worse right now.
[02:57:37.826 --> 02:57:39.468]  The case would have been closed years ago.
[02:57:40.929 --> 02:57:41.549]  Absolutely.
[02:57:41.609 --> 02:57:42.670]  I mean, that's history.
[02:57:42.770 --> 02:57:44.211]  Bob Chapman, thanks for coming on the show.
[02:57:44.591 --> 02:57:45.712]  Thanks for having me again.
[02:57:45.852 --> 02:57:46.193]  Loved it.
[02:57:46.453 --> 02:57:46.773]  You bet.
[02:57:46.813 --> 02:57:47.394]  We'll have you back.
[02:57:47.994 --> 02:57:54.419]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central, and back on Monday, 11 to 2 Central, right here on this same station.
[02:57:55.425 --> 02:58:03.071]  And I want to thank the affiliates, the sponsors, the folks running the show, of course, number one, God, and the listeners for everything.
[02:58:03.892 --> 02:58:05.293]  And I just hope we've gotten you to think.
[02:58:05.313 --> 02:58:07.875]  We've jumped around a lot, covered a lot of different news and issues.
[02:58:08.936 --> 02:58:12.719]  The power elite doesn't care about your life, your standard of living.
[02:58:12.739 --> 02:58:14.080]  They want you under their control.
[02:58:14.540 --> 02:58:16.342]  They want you broken down and dumbed down.
[02:58:16.982 --> 02:58:18.063]  So stop being part of it.
[02:58:18.163 --> 02:58:18.944]  Love your family.
[02:58:18.984 --> 02:58:20.044]  Spend time with your children.
[02:58:20.385 --> 02:58:21.045]  Get out of debt.
[02:58:21.105 --> 02:58:22.226]  Get involved in your community.
[02:58:22.967 --> 02:58:24.408]  That's how we're going to save this country.
[02:58:24.972 --> 02:58:25.756]  God bless you all.
[02:58:25.796 --> 02:58:26.881]  See you back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:58:32.108 --> 02:58:37.571]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:58:38.012 --> 02:58:42.254]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:58:42.494 --> 02:58:49.518]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:58:49.899 --> 02:58:56.002]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:58:56.022 --> 02:58:57.363]  There are no side effects.
[02:58:57.523 --> 02:58:58.044]  We're good to go.
[02:58:58.064 --> 02:58:58.564]  We're good to go.
[02:59:14.478 --> 02:59:17.622]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[02:59:17.642 --> 02:59:17.742]  866-885-6625.

[02:59:17.983 --> 02:59:18.924]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
