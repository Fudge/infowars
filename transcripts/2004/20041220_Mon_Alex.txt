[00:00:05.458 --> 00:00:06.119]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:07.839]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:09.660]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.120]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:12.781]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:17.102]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:21.704]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.745 --> 00:00:36.946]  Well, five days to Christmas.
[00:00:38.827 --> 00:00:43.950]  It is Monday, the 20th day of December 2004.
[00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:47.092]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:47.132 --> 00:00:48.813]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:51.055]  We're going to have wide open phones.
[00:00:51.955 --> 00:00:56.898]  But in the second hour, we're going to be talking about thought crime in America and across the globe.
[00:00:56.918 --> 00:01:00.220]  Remember that headline last Friday?
[00:01:01.221 --> 00:01:02.802]  Center for Law and Policy.
[00:01:03.462 --> 00:01:09.564]  Christians face 47 years in prison for reading the Bible, praying on street.
[00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:14.426]  It's not just France or England that are passing laws like this.
[00:01:15.167 --> 00:01:20.669]  You read passages criticizing the gay movement, the homosexuals.
[00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:27.051]  In many cases, now you get arrested, but before they just let you out of jail for a nuisance arrest.
[00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:28.512]  Now they're charging you.
[00:01:30.658 --> 00:01:34.441]  Now, for the left out there, the so-called left, there really is no left or right.
[00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:38.084]  There's only freedom and slavery, depending on what end of the spectrum you desire.
[00:01:41.227 --> 00:01:43.990]  People that wear shirts that say, Peace on Earth, get arrested.
[00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:54.419]  Folks that go and protest with a sign saying, No Blood for Oil, and amongst 500 Bush supporters on a public sidewalk, they get arrested, charged with felonies, convicted.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.360]  And you know what?
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.162]  I stand up for them and their rights.
[00:01:59.631 --> 00:02:01.573]  And I'm disgusted by what happens to them.
[00:02:02.553 --> 00:02:16.285]  But the left, a lot of the so-called left, loves it when Christian conservatives who go out and voice their free speech are arrested and charged with very serious crimes.
[00:02:19.527 --> 00:02:22.790]  So you ought to be ashamed of yourself, you so-called left out there.
[00:02:23.531 --> 00:02:27.314]  It's been the libertarians, it's been the bedrock grassroots conservatives
[00:02:28.177 --> 00:02:31.858]  That have been defending your free speech rights.
[00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.821]  But a lot of the left out there doesn't care about conservatives' rights.
[00:02:38.861 --> 00:02:44.183]  Well, if you don't care about somebody else's rights, you're not going to have any rights when it comes time.
[00:02:47.664 --> 00:02:48.345]  It's amazing.
[00:02:50.125 --> 00:02:56.728]  So, coming up in the second hour, we'll be talking to Michael Markavage.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.883]  Of Repent America, who is facing up to 47 years in jail for protesting at Outfest.
[00:03:07.124 --> 00:03:10.885]  So that is coming up, and it is very scary.
[00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:20.029]  And all over the country, the gay and lesbian movement is trying to silence and censor people that are critical of it.
[00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:25.531]  And it's wrong.
[00:03:26.252 --> 00:03:27.573]  And it's very dangerous.
[00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:29.914]  What was it?
[00:03:32.116 --> 00:03:51.629]  Two years ago, I interviewed one of the top BBC reporters who went to a rural affairs public meeting and got up and said, rural communities deserve the same rights as homosexuals and Muslims.
[00:03:53.821 --> 00:03:58.964]  And Scotland Yard Diversity Unit, Hate Crimes Unit, went out and arrested him.
[00:03:59.004 --> 00:04:01.265]  This was in the BBC and London Telegraph.
[00:04:02.146 --> 00:04:15.213]  In fact, I want to instruct my webmaster, Paul Watson, at PrisonPlanet.com, why don't we grab that old audio interview and that text report, I know it's in the old audio archive, and post it under this current story, just to give people an idea of what we're facing.
[00:04:16.113 --> 00:04:21.476]  And Scotland Yard, the head of the unit, said, you're not allowed to say the word homosexual.
[00:04:22.347 --> 00:04:24.108]  Because that is a derogatory term.
[00:04:24.508 --> 00:04:27.550]  So now if you say heterosexual, is that derogatory?
[00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.773]  I mean, this shows just a level of semantical manipulation.
[00:04:32.874 --> 00:04:37.217]  Like a lot of people think that if you say the word Caucasian, it's racist, or Negro.
[00:04:37.597 --> 00:04:39.898]  No, these are just scientific terms.
[00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:47.043]  So now even using words, official words, is bad.
[00:04:47.083 --> 00:04:47.243]  Amazing.
[00:04:49.585 --> 00:04:50.025]  Amazing.
[00:04:51.542 --> 00:04:55.343]  There is so much news, it is all coming up on the other side of this quick break.
[00:04:57.243 --> 00:05:05.445]  presentplanet.tv and coldwars.com Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.625 --> 00:05:10.046]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.207 --> 00:05:14.588]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.628 --> 00:05:15.948]  The New World Order.
[00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:21.971]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:28.974]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.094 --> 00:05:31.175]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:41.781]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.261 --> 00:05:44.243]  You want to understand what the new rule order really is?
[00:05:44.424 --> 00:05:47.507]  Then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:05:47.988 --> 00:05:50.611]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:05:50.671 --> 00:05:51.492]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:51.512 --> 00:05:51.892]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:51.912 --> 00:05:53.034]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:00.582 --> 00:06:03.864]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:03.904 --> 00:06:08.086]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:08.346 --> 00:06:11.147]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:11.327 --> 00:06:13.729]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:13.929 --> 00:06:22.573]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:22.753 --> 00:06:24.114]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:06:24.294 --> 00:06:28.456]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path.
[00:06:28.496 --> 00:06:29.437]  Not yet available?
[00:07:01.157 --> 00:07:02.637]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:07:02.837 --> 00:07:10.179]  Jerry Guidetti from the ARC Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:14.900]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the ARC Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:25.002]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[00:07:25.763 --> 00:07:29.427]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[00:07:29.767 --> 00:07:32.250]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:38.477]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[00:07:38.737 --> 00:07:40.279]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[00:07:40.539 --> 00:07:41.440]  Friends, don't wait.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.504]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[00:07:44.664 --> 00:07:45.585]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[00:07:45.605 --> 00:07:45.825]  That's 800-255-1912.
[00:07:45.845 --> 00:07:48.929]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:49.910]  It's powerful stuff.
[00:08:05.653 --> 00:08:06.294]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.975 --> 00:08:08.016]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.737 --> 00:08:09.838]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.479 --> 00:08:11.340]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.061 --> 00:08:13.983]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.003 --> 00:08:17.288]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.828 --> 00:08:21.893]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.884 --> 00:08:31.750]  All right, we're now 8 minutes and 15 seconds into this Monday broadcast.
[00:08:32.291 --> 00:08:33.732]  Your calls are coming up at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:33.752 --> 00:08:33.812]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:33.852 --> 00:08:36.855]  Time names President George W. Bush, 2004 Person of the Year.
[00:08:47.478 --> 00:08:53.019]  They have a twin issue that's coming out listing soldiers as person of the year.
[00:08:53.659 --> 00:08:58.220]  So then if you're against Bush being person of the year, why, you must be against the soldiers too.
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.640]  Now, Time Magazine has a long history of this.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.361]  They made Adolf Hitler person of the year back in the 1930s.
[00:09:08.462 --> 00:09:11.262]  And I would give Bush a puppet of the year.
[00:09:12.542 --> 00:09:16.063]  I think that would be a really good term for President Bush.
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.560]  Our Christian conservative leader.
[00:09:19.181 --> 00:09:25.983]  By the way, I mean, I'm so sick of hearing about Hillary Clinton and tired of hearing about the evil Democrats all day long.
[00:09:27.383 --> 00:09:30.984]  Yes, we know the Democrats are bought and paid for by the New World Order and their corporate interests.
[00:09:31.424 --> 00:09:33.305]  We know that the Democrats are bad news.
[00:09:34.165 --> 00:09:37.486]  And we know they're carrying out the exact same agenda as George W. Bush.
[00:09:39.186 --> 00:09:44.328]  I mean, when George W. Bush wants women in front-line combat, the conservatives hail it as conservative.
[00:09:46.661 --> 00:09:55.427]  When George W. Bush wants to appoint somebody to be the Attorney General who's pro-abortion, anti-gun, pro-open border, it's hailed as conservative.
[00:09:55.447 --> 00:09:58.970]  I mean, can you imagine if Bill Clinton was doing all this?
[00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:04.434]  Every day I look at the so-called conservative websites, and it's Hillary's doing this, Bill Clinton's doing that.
[00:10:04.814 --> 00:10:06.995]  Yes, and George Bush is protecting them.
[00:10:07.296 --> 00:10:10.218]  George Bush is blocking them from prosecution from Congress.
[00:10:11.999 --> 00:10:13.020]  From investigation.
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:13.520]  It just...
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:20.203]  We could sit here all day and talk about Hillary Clinton and talk about Jesse Jackson.
[00:10:20.903 --> 00:10:23.625]  Hillary Clinton and Jesse Jackson aren't running anything.
[00:10:24.645 --> 00:10:27.327]  Hillary Clinton and Jesse Jackson are distractions.
[00:10:28.187 --> 00:10:32.589]  And I just wanted to say that you're not going to hear about them for hour after hour on this broadcast.
[00:10:33.069 --> 00:10:37.071]  We're going to talk about the people who are in control that are dismantling this country.
[00:10:38.212 --> 00:10:43.134]  President George W. Bush has been named Time Magazine's 2004 Person of the Year.
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:11:03.183]  For sticking to his guns, literally and figuratively, for reshaping the rules of politics to fit his 10-gallon hat leadership, oh, he's a Texan, no he's not, style, and for persuading a majority of voters, this time around, that he deserved to be in the White House for another four years.
[00:11:03.263 --> 00:11:11.385]  We named George W. Bush as Times Person of the Year for 2004, writes managing editor Jim Kelly in a letter to readers.
[00:11:12.945 --> 00:11:13.845]  In Time Magazine.
[00:11:14.511 --> 00:11:19.195]  Times double issue of newsstands for two weeks, beginning Monday, December 20th.
[00:11:20.356 --> 00:11:25.741]  They have the Oval Office interview with his lordship.
[00:11:26.882 --> 00:11:27.383]  Amazing.
[00:11:29.385 --> 00:11:34.870]  Good news, obviously, and I think your prayers helped early in the day, Friday last week.
[00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:38.213]  I know I certainly prayed that the baby be found.
[00:11:39.054 --> 00:11:42.756]  And it was obviously in Missouri or Kansas or Oklahoma, somewhere nearby.
[00:11:42.776 --> 00:11:45.137]  It was found at a farmhouse in Kansas.
[00:11:46.157 --> 00:11:51.340]  Slaying suspect allegedly showed off the baby, going around saying, this is my baby.
[00:11:53.481 --> 00:12:00.764]  She was one of these women with dozens of small dogs that she dressed up that were her baby, and obviously a complete and total lunatic.
[00:12:03.526 --> 00:12:04.526]  Just amazing.
[00:12:04.886 --> 00:12:08.148]  Would go strangle a woman, allegedly, though she's now confessed.
[00:12:08.846 --> 00:12:14.851]  We'll go strangle a woman and then cut out her baby and then run off and start showing it off.
[00:12:15.812 --> 00:12:19.675]  Went home and told her husband, I gave birth to this baby.
[00:12:23.377 --> 00:12:27.521]  And there have been three cases of this in the last two years.
[00:12:29.725 --> 00:12:40.591]  Of women who are obviously demon-possessed by legions of hobgoblins going out and just cutting out babies.
[00:12:40.691 --> 00:12:43.753]  But in many cases, in the other two cases, the babies died.
[00:12:44.414 --> 00:12:46.275]  In this case, the baby did not die.
[00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:50.897]  But this should bring to mind, in this country, Bush did not ban it, by the way.
[00:12:50.917 --> 00:12:55.360]  It's been overturned by the courts, and it had loopholes in it that were gigantic.
[00:12:57.433 --> 00:13:03.916]  Partial birth abortion goes on by the tens of thousands every year in this country, and the baby could be born and adopted.
[00:13:05.677 --> 00:13:10.599]  They will kill babies up to the week of birth in this nation.
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:18.503]  And Bush has the legislative, the executive, and the judicial right now, the Supreme Court,
[00:13:19.099 --> 00:13:24.222]  But you don't see the so-called conservative court going, yes, we agree the partial birth abortion ban stands.
[00:13:24.622 --> 00:13:28.124]  Contrary to that, you see them not hearing the case.
[00:13:32.127 --> 00:13:40.371]  But that doesn't matter because in symbol only, we're told we have this big conservative victory with this Supreme Court.
[00:13:40.731 --> 00:13:41.952]  But imagine the father.
[00:13:41.992 --> 00:13:44.614]  I mean, he did lose his wife, but thank God,
[00:13:45.316 --> 00:13:51.078]  And he is thankful to God, he said, and the police and the public for keeping their eyes peeled.
[00:13:51.879 --> 00:14:00.962]  This psychopathic woman had the police surround her and get the baby back on Friday afternoon, Friday night.
[00:14:02.403 --> 00:14:03.763]  Just unbelievable.
[00:14:05.924 --> 00:14:09.666]  And the father was united with the baby on Saturday at the hospital.
[00:14:12.207 --> 00:14:13.327]  Oh boy, I just
[00:14:16.303 --> 00:14:25.809]  What in the world is going on in this country where we're now seeing an increased occurrence of these type of events?
[00:14:26.549 --> 00:14:32.933]  Talking about losing your First Amendment, protesters fear lack of access to inaugural parade.
[00:14:34.074 --> 00:14:40.818]  The Park Service, months ago, the group had gotten together, and so we want to protest here on the triumphant...
[00:14:41.508 --> 00:14:47.391]  Caesar crossing the Rubicon, coming back into Rome, back into D.C., Lord Bush, man of the year.
[00:14:48.251 --> 00:14:51.653]  And now they're told, oh, sorry, we've given that protest space to another group.
[00:14:52.013 --> 00:14:55.675]  You can protest five miles away, where no one can see.
[00:14:56.535 --> 00:15:08.961]  The Park Service has given the Presidential Inaugural Committee clearance to erect bleachers along parts of Pennsylvania Avenue for an anti-war campaign and requested permits to stage a large-scale protest during President Bush's parade.
[00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:20.538]  And the Answer Coalition had applied for permits to assemble, and in some cases build bleachers along parts of the historic street that stretches from the Capitol to the White House.
[00:15:20.998 --> 00:15:29.320]  The National Park Service has not acted on the Coalition's permit request, even though they put theirs in before this other pro-Bush grant that's been given the area.
[00:15:30.131 --> 00:15:47.239]  But angry officials from the coalition argued yesterday that permitting the inaugural committee to build bleachers in several open spaces, such as Freedom Plaza, across from the White House and in front of the FBI headquarters and Justice Department prohibits the coalition from gathering in such areas to stage their large demonstrations.
[00:15:47.919 --> 00:15:53.542]  The goal from the beginning was equal access to Pennsylvania Avenue, Mara, Vara, Hyden,
[00:15:54.615 --> 00:16:04.379]  Hillard, representative of the Partnership for Civil Justice, which is working on behalf of ANSWER, said in a news conference, we can't have what the inaugural committee gets.
[00:16:04.859 --> 00:16:09.221]  They've issued a permit to another group for the same space we originally asked for.
[00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:14.723]  They're telling them, we may not give you a permit to protest anywhere.
[00:16:15.063 --> 00:16:18.104]  By the way, you don't need permits to protest on sidewalks.
[00:16:18.884 --> 00:16:21.165]  Federal and state courts have ruled this over and over again.
[00:16:22.384 --> 00:16:27.446]  Permitting started for official parades and things if you wanted to take over streets.
[00:16:28.226 --> 00:16:31.107]  If you wanted to take over squares.
[00:16:31.887 --> 00:16:36.168]  There is no law that you have to have one for the sidewalk.
[00:16:36.688 --> 00:16:40.550]  Though police will still arrest you in many areas if you don't have it.
[00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:51.233]  Years ago, in downtown Austin, they would arrest you if you didn't have a permit protesting on the sidewalk until they lost, what was it, three different large lawsuits?
[00:16:53.011 --> 00:17:00.338]  One big case was they had a disabled group out there in their wheelchairs on the sidewalk by the governor's mansion, and they arrested them en masse, and they sued and won.
[00:17:00.358 --> 00:17:02.481]  A bunch of other people did as well.
[00:17:02.501 --> 00:17:17.695]  A radio station I work for sent one of the interns down with a sign that says, I love Bush, next to people being arrested, and they left her alone and were shaking her hand, the state police, along with the APD.
[00:17:19.256 --> 00:17:21.857]  And that was helpful in the court case.
[00:17:21.877 --> 00:17:23.318]  Of course, that was in the Dallas Morning News.
[00:17:24.158 --> 00:17:25.939]  So it's all selectively enforced.
[00:17:25.999 --> 00:17:27.020]  But that's Austin.
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:31.722]  In Austin, the police know that you can stand on the street corner because they've been told.
[00:17:32.623 --> 00:17:34.744]  But you can't go on the street, which I think is reasonable.
[00:17:34.824 --> 00:17:36.664]  I mean, you can't block traffic without a permit.
[00:17:38.765 --> 00:17:45.809]  The problem is, other parts of the country... It was a case earlier this year in North Carolina...
[00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:48.871]  Or a man had a no blood for oil sign.
[00:17:48.891 --> 00:17:49.711]  I talked about that earlier.
[00:17:49.731 --> 00:17:52.513]  There have been countless other cases of similar things happening.
[00:17:53.093 --> 00:17:58.796]  And there were over 500 Bush supporters on the sidewalk in the route he was going to be driving to his hotel in.
[00:17:59.676 --> 00:18:04.479]  And the Secret Service walked over to the police and said, tell that man he can't stand here protesting.
[00:18:04.919 --> 00:18:06.560]  And the guy said, well, what do you mean?
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.502]  I've got a sign that's anti-Bush and all these pro-Bush people.
[00:18:10.922 --> 00:18:12.983]  And they arrested him, charged him with a felony.
[00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:22.774]  And that's what he's now... He was convicted last time we saw in the newspaper of several months in jail and a large fine.
[00:18:22.814 --> 00:18:27.656]  The felony was commuted down to a misdemeanor, but... Come on, people!
[00:18:29.797 --> 00:18:33.058]  And then I, of course, in the next hour... Here's the headline.
[00:18:33.138 --> 00:18:38.060]  Christians face 47 years in prison for reading Bible, praying on street.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.201]  And I have mainstream news articles...
[00:18:42.273 --> 00:18:45.075]  That are admitting this, but acting like it's a good thing.
[00:18:45.376 --> 00:18:55.283]  Oh yes, we are arresting people because they went to a gay and lesbian rally and were protesting it peaceably.
[00:18:55.984 --> 00:19:02.129]  And well, reading the Old Testament could have incited violence, and so we're charging you with inciting violence.
[00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:05.952]  So it's like communist China or something.
[00:19:06.872 --> 00:19:13.915]  And again, whether it's conservatives protesting or liberals protesting, I believe in their right to demonstrate and protest.
[00:19:14.955 --> 00:19:18.737]  And I want to hear from the left on this.
[00:19:19.317 --> 00:19:20.497]  Again, the so-called left.
[00:19:20.917 --> 00:19:24.179]  I mean, why aren't the indie media sites decrying this?
[00:19:24.899 --> 00:19:27.060]  Why aren't you protesting this?
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.040]  Why aren't you involved?
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.101]  Why aren't you up in arms?
[00:19:29.481 --> 00:19:35.343]  Are you so stupid as to think that you can have somebody else lose their right to free speech and that you're not going to lose yours?
[00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:37.866]  Come on!
[00:19:39.127 --> 00:19:41.288]  You walk the walk, folks.
[00:19:41.328 --> 00:19:42.249]  We'll have a free country.
[00:19:42.269 --> 00:19:44.170]  But now, all you do is talk the talk.
[00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:45.390]  You don't walk the walk.
[00:19:46.771 --> 00:19:47.351]  Despicable!
[00:19:48.212 --> 00:19:49.232]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:19:49.272 --> 00:19:50.733]  There is so much other news.
[00:19:51.233 --> 00:19:53.995]  It is all vital to the future of the republic.

[00:19:57.217 --> 00:19:57.977]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:02.079 --> 00:20:06.663]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glass, who is a pharmacist from Mark's Plaza Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[00:20:06.783 --> 00:20:08.004]  Hi, Alan, welcome to the program.
[00:20:08.184 --> 00:20:08.765]  Thank you, Marvin.
[00:20:08.945 --> 00:20:12.308]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[00:20:12.488 --> 00:20:13.008]  Is that true?
[00:20:13.229 --> 00:20:14.229]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[00:20:14.249 --> 00:20:17.232]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[00:20:17.272 --> 00:20:17.552]  price.
[00:20:17.752 --> 00:20:19.814]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[00:20:19.874 --> 00:20:20.615]  They're very common.
[00:20:20.695 --> 00:20:23.898]  Those common drugs you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[00:20:23.918 --> 00:20:24.158]  price.
[00:20:24.438 --> 00:20:25.579]  Now what about Tamoxifen?
[00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:28.020]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.041]  Tamoxifen, you can see a 75% savings against the regular U.S.
[00:20:32.081 --> 00:20:32.342]  price.
[00:20:32.722 --> 00:20:35.103]  Now are these brand name products made by the same companies?
[00:20:35.363 --> 00:20:37.384]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:39.485]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.

[00:22:26.399 --> 00:22:38.213]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[00:23:02.167 --> 00:23:04.308]  Those dark, depressing days are here.
[00:23:04.992 --> 00:23:08.474]  Are you among the 15% of North Americans who suffer from the winter blues?
[00:23:09.075 --> 00:23:12.617]  This condition is simply caused by the lack of sunlight during the short winter days.
[00:23:13.278 --> 00:23:15.879]  Do you suffer from constant fatigue and lack of energy?
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.741]  Do you have a hard time pulling yourself out of bed in the morning?
[00:23:19.242 --> 00:23:20.663]  Do you put on weight in the winter?
[00:23:21.343 --> 00:23:23.084]  Is your life on hold till the spring?
[00:23:23.625 --> 00:23:24.585]  Check with your doctor.
[00:23:24.705 --> 00:23:29.608]  You may be suffering from the winter blues or from SAD, Seasonal Affective Disorder.
[00:23:30.069 --> 00:23:34.792]  In all likelihood, your doctor will recommend bright light therapy with one of our special lights.

[00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:28.397]  Arnold Schwarzenegger has been traveling around the world Japan, Germany with the giant murals behind him of his face in dark sunglasses
[00:24:29.335 --> 00:24:38.797]  It's like North Korea or something with Kim Jong-il where he goes and gives a speech and there's a giant picture of him behind the... I mean, this is not the American tradition.
[00:24:38.837 --> 00:24:46.438]  This is right out of Russia, right out of China, right out of East Germany or Nazi Germany or North Korea or Havana, Cuba.
[00:24:49.139 --> 00:24:51.499]  And he said, I pioneered action films.
[00:24:51.519 --> 00:24:52.980]  I invented the genre.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:53.860]  That's not true.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:58.921]  I mean, what about Steve McQueen and people like
[00:24:59.787 --> 00:25:02.771]  Charles Bronson or John Wayne.
[00:25:03.452 --> 00:25:06.777]  And he went on to say he pioneered bodybuilding and made it what it is.
[00:25:06.817 --> 00:25:07.578]  That's probably true.
[00:25:07.598 --> 00:25:10.162]  And he went on to say, now I'm going to change politics.
[00:25:10.222 --> 00:25:12.104]  And yeah, I think I should be able to run for president.
[00:25:13.366 --> 00:25:14.588]  I might run for president.
[00:25:14.628 --> 00:25:16.831]  Now it's, oh, I might run for president.
[00:25:18.607 --> 00:25:30.154]  And major publications admit this is basically a presidential international campaign, traipsing around looking presidential, with giant, everywhere he goes, a giant picture of himself behind himself.
[00:25:30.794 --> 00:25:42.762]  His giant face, like Big Brother, just a giant face of Arnold Schwarzenegger, looming, larger than life, huge, oh, and right in front of it, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:25:42.822 --> 00:25:44.002]  I mean, this is sick, folks.
[00:25:44.243 --> 00:25:48.085]  Can't you see all the trappings, all the key indicators here?
[00:25:49.562 --> 00:25:52.063]  And he said the Republican Party's got to go more to the left.
[00:25:52.083 --> 00:25:53.883]  And that's what he's going to do.
[00:25:53.903 --> 00:25:56.764]  Well, I couldn't see it going more to the left than it already has.
[00:25:56.804 --> 00:26:03.266]  Signing on to UNESCO and the UN and pushing for gun control and open borders and doubling the growth rate of the government.
[00:26:05.147 --> 00:26:06.407]  Folks, it's amazing.
[00:26:07.077 --> 00:26:08.538]  Roger in Pennsylvania.
[00:26:08.578 --> 00:26:09.578]  Roger, you're on the air.
[00:26:09.638 --> 00:26:10.118]  Go ahead.
[00:26:10.559 --> 00:26:10.979]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:26:11.039 --> 00:26:21.143]  I just kind of called early because I had a fair bit to unload about the rare interest yesterday listening to the reality hemorrhage on yesterday, Sunday morning's Talking Heads.
[00:26:21.163 --> 00:26:28.006]  Early in respect to them pointing out how both the Iraq war and election are crashing down all around the administration.
[00:26:28.026 --> 00:26:33.489]  Now remember, these are only stock establishment war-supporting sources.
[00:26:34.716 --> 00:26:37.898]  So I'm going to revert to the inadequate conventional paradigm here.
[00:26:38.478 --> 00:26:46.722]  But to hear them finally comment, as one moderator put it, how many Republican congressmen are finally expressing the angst which they had been suppressing prior to the election.
[00:26:47.323 --> 00:26:56.027]  To hear about how the Bush-Runsfeld Chinese lean and mean warfare with less than 150,000 troops was a big, fat, unworkable lie.
[00:26:56.227 --> 00:26:57.348]  But look, sir, sir.
[00:26:59.003 --> 00:27:06.747]  Don't think that Lott and McCain and all these people are going public because they are really angry at Bush.
[00:27:07.368 --> 00:27:21.896]  This is all staged to get massive increases in funding, and this is nothing but political theater to kind of salve the country because they know the general public is against what the administration is doing, and what you're saying is true.
[00:27:22.722 --> 00:27:27.863]  The Associated Press admits our troops are basically in full retreat, being slaughtered.
[00:27:27.903 --> 00:27:30.044]  The Iraqis are dropping everything and running.
[00:27:30.604 --> 00:27:35.765]  The Iraqis, the Republican Guard turned National Guard, National Defense Force.
[00:27:36.125 --> 00:27:37.885]  And Bush had to admit it this morning.
[00:27:38.605 --> 00:27:41.406]  And things are in a shambles and imploding over there.
[00:27:41.706 --> 00:27:46.367]  But that was meant to happen before the UN goes in as the savior and the good cop.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.261]  Oh, I well know that, Alex.
[00:27:48.521 --> 00:27:50.563]  Now, of course, they didn't call it a lie, of course.
[00:27:50.603 --> 00:27:54.866]  That's just an inescapable conclusion about this Liam Means Force.
[00:27:55.407 --> 00:28:03.793]  And then to hear William Crystal, too, I guess, what do you call it, the last holdout to join the chorus dumping on Rumsfeld as being incompetent, that's the biggest laugh of all.
[00:28:03.853 --> 00:28:08.477]  As one commentator put it, Crystal is just looking for an escape hatch for himself.
[00:28:09.446 --> 00:28:16.930]  What he didn't quite say, but anybody knows anything, knows means in part is that Crystal is, of course, a primary flacker neocon in us into the war.
[00:28:18.591 --> 00:28:20.752]  His father founded the neocons.
[00:28:20.772 --> 00:28:24.154]  He was the head of the Communist Fourth International.
[00:28:24.655 --> 00:28:30.718]  By the way, folks, that is AP, that is Toronto Star, that is Washington Post.
[00:28:31.505 --> 00:28:37.749]  Yeah, and of course, Crystal's only been tweakingly critical of his and the Bush-Runsfeld war until now.
[00:28:38.249 --> 00:28:49.255]  And more to the point also, I mentioned today's war status being, having been totally predictable one and two years ago, the only mystery being to explain how today's war status could have turned out any better.
[00:28:49.876 --> 00:28:51.557]  And then they quote John Warner,
[00:28:53.188 --> 00:28:54.409]  Will the war be successful?
[00:28:54.709 --> 00:28:57.451]  Well, I think it will, but the challenges are mounting.
[00:28:57.511 --> 00:29:07.380]  Well, look, a lot of this is, again, this is part of the complex dialectic, Roger, and they know exactly what they're doing.
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:14.786]  This way they can just later in a few months remove Rumsfeld and then, oh, it was all his fault, now we've got a new start.
[00:29:15.498 --> 00:29:23.843]  This is all part of the theater, like the Israeli-Palestinian affair, where every year, oh, this year we're going to fix it, and then next year we're going to fix it.
[00:29:23.883 --> 00:29:25.104]  It's not meant to be fixed.
[00:29:25.444 --> 00:29:26.825]  It's a giant business.
[00:29:27.505 --> 00:29:31.368]  They want the Iraq war to go on as long as possible, just like Vietnam.
[00:29:31.388 --> 00:29:32.008]  Thanks for the call.
[00:29:33.469 --> 00:29:36.971]  And then they'll demonize certain mid-level characters.
[00:29:39.212 --> 00:29:40.153]  It's theater, people.
[00:29:40.173 --> 00:29:41.774]  I mean, that's all it is.
[00:29:42.466 --> 00:29:43.947]  John Kerry was for the war.
[00:29:44.228 --> 00:29:45.149]  They're all for it.
[00:29:45.189 --> 00:29:46.730]  It's going to continue forever.
[00:29:47.251 --> 00:29:48.552]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[00:29:48.572 --> 00:29:48.972]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.535 --> 00:29:52.455]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.916 --> 00:29:54.517]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.537 --> 00:29:58.121]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.644 --> 00:30:09.128]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:09.568 --> 00:30:13.791]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:30:14.031 --> 00:30:21.076]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:21.437 --> 00:30:27.541]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:27.701 --> 00:30:28.922]  There are no side effects.
[00:30:29.102 --> 00:30:31.445]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:28.992]  And then we'll get into what Roger was just mentioning.
[00:33:29.072 --> 00:33:29.933]  Leading senators...
[00:33:30.643 --> 00:33:33.885]  Hesitant to replace Rumsfeld despite mistakes in Iraq.
[00:33:34.885 --> 00:33:47.872]  You know, why do you think all of a sudden it comes out that Rumsfeld has a printer stamp his name on letters to people's front doors about their dead family?
[00:33:50.713 --> 00:33:54.835]  Why do you think it's coming out now about no real armor on a lot of the vehicles?
[00:33:56.316 --> 00:34:00.258]  It's coming out now because the establishment has chosen to bring it out now
[00:34:01.186 --> 00:34:01.526]  Morning Alex.
[00:34:01.546 --> 00:34:01.646]  Hello.
[00:34:31.644 --> 00:34:36.589]  I wanted to talk to you about, I heard your interview with Dr. Deagle that you just recently did.
[00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:37.110]  Yes.
[00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:45.539]  And he had made a comment, actually sort of a prediction, and said that he had sources that said that a draft is going to be upcoming in March.
[00:34:46.181 --> 00:34:56.290]  Well, they've introduced 12 different pieces of legislation, and they've set up the draft boards again, and they've admitted they may do special technical skills drafts.
[00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:59.272]  That's been in the Houston Chronicle and other publications.
[00:34:59.332 --> 00:35:10.362]  So it's not a rumor that they need a draft, that they've geared up for one, but I think that will come after a terrorist attack engineered by the military-industrial complex.
[00:35:11.423 --> 00:35:12.844]  Yeah, that's what I was wondering is,
[00:35:13.257 --> 00:35:20.203]  To have an absolute all-out draft and for Bush to cover himself, that, oh, we need this draft now.
[00:35:20.223 --> 00:35:23.326]  He needs a convenient attack to justify it.
[00:35:23.486 --> 00:35:36.637]  Would you agree that, I guess, February or March might be the gold date for this to happen in order for them to legitimize the draft, even though he publicly said in his stage debate that, oh, there's not going to be a draft?
[00:35:38.263 --> 00:35:40.904]  Well, again, I'm not going to sit here and make predictions.
[00:35:41.104 --> 00:35:44.806]  I certainly think we're going to see more terror attacks in this country in the future.
[00:35:44.826 --> 00:35:47.147]  I think that's a foregone conclusion.
[00:35:48.167 --> 00:36:02.194]  And I pretty much know who's going to be behind those attacks, and that's criminal elements of this government, who have all the motives for it, and who have their official battle plans to carry out terror attacks, Operation Northwoods and PNAC and others.
[00:36:03.654 --> 00:36:07.596]  But clearly, they've got an agenda to get this done.
[00:36:09.426 --> 00:36:09.646]  Yes.
[00:36:11.347 --> 00:36:12.628]  But I don't have a crystal ball.
[00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:14.249]  Oh, yeah, I know.
[00:36:14.269 --> 00:36:22.454]  I was just wondering if you might agree with that, but I know we can't really, you know... Yeah, you know, I personally... I personally...
[00:36:24.548 --> 00:36:26.610]  Just stick to what I can prove.
[00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:34.859]  But, I mean, I've always said that I think after the election in the first of the year was going to be a much more dangerous time than before the election.
[00:36:34.919 --> 00:36:42.187]  I thought that clearly all the reports of there was going to be an attack, the White House said, the Capitol will be attacked.
[00:36:42.207 --> 00:36:42.988]  I mean, this was U.S.
[00:36:43.008 --> 00:36:43.909]  News and World Report.
[00:36:44.609 --> 00:36:46.129]  There's going to be terrorist attacks.
[00:36:46.189 --> 00:36:48.330]  I said, clearly, that's fear-mongering.
[00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:54.431]  I said, there could be an attack, but I see the increased danger of that coming in the new year.
[00:36:55.292 --> 00:37:01.413]  So I would think we would have a heightened risk of a real attack when they're not running around warning you of attacks.
[00:37:01.693 --> 00:37:02.673]  Yep, you're right.
[00:37:03.774 --> 00:37:13.096]  Like, oh, people criticize Bush for the war, but now a new attack took place and tens of thousands are dead and we've all just got to get behind the leader.
[00:37:13.986 --> 00:37:20.030]  Speaking of fearmongering, I also wanted to mention real quick that on January 2nd, they're going to run this movie on FX.
[00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:22.191]  I don't know if you've heard of it, but it's Smallpox.
[00:37:22.211 --> 00:37:23.432]  I don't really watch TV, no.
[00:37:24.313 --> 00:37:24.793]  Oh, okay.
[00:37:24.933 --> 00:37:28.835]  They made a Smallpox movie, and the little trailer... Yeah, I've heard about that.
[00:37:28.855 --> 00:37:31.977]  And then they got that martial law, keep us safe, and... Yeah.
[00:37:33.458 --> 00:37:37.621]  And the commercial says, blatantly, it's not a question of if, but when.
[00:37:38.695 --> 00:37:41.176]  A little introduction if you watch the FX channel.
[00:37:41.216 --> 00:37:46.379]  Which is what the CFR was saying five years ago, which is what the government promotes and prepares for.
[00:37:46.399 --> 00:37:54.282]  And also to get everyone in a state of panic that, hey, this is going to happen, and we all need to be prepared and scared.
[00:37:54.723 --> 00:37:55.703]  Yeah, no, I hear you.
[00:37:55.723 --> 00:37:56.363]  Thanks for the call.
[00:37:56.383 --> 00:37:57.164]  Really good points.
[00:37:57.484 --> 00:38:06.208]  Back in 1999, they had a five-night special that began on a Tuesday and then ran through the next Monday.
[00:38:07.665 --> 00:38:09.347]  With Ted Koppel on Nightline.
[00:38:10.989 --> 00:38:14.352]  And they would quietly announce at the first that this is a simulation.
[00:38:15.233 --> 00:38:17.195]  This is not a real broadcast.
[00:38:18.316 --> 00:38:24.483]  But then Ted Koppel and generals and all these people would have simulations of a smallpox attack.
[00:38:25.183 --> 00:38:30.169]  And they would show video of our troops in Florida or our troops...
[00:38:32.781 --> 00:38:48.944]  In other areas where there have been hurricanes and disasters, arresting people in checkpoints, and they would show that and superimpose it over New York and announce, you know, martial law has been declared, hundreds of thousands dying, and they did this whole drill.
[00:38:49.485 --> 00:38:56.006]  And then they would, at the end, say, this has been a drill, it'll be back on tomorrow night with the next phase of the five-day outbreak.
[00:38:56.926 --> 00:39:02.490]  And what it means, and they would announce that this is probably going to happen on a question of if but when.
[00:39:03.931 --> 00:39:05.332]  They normally combine those two.
[00:39:05.692 --> 00:39:07.853]  Probably going to happen on a question of if but when.
[00:39:08.994 --> 00:39:12.397]  And then, earlier this year, oh, we're going to be attacked by terrorists.
[00:39:12.437 --> 00:39:16.279]  It's going to happen before the election, or on the day of the election.
[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:23.384]  And then the White House would come back out and say, no, no, no, it's probably going to happen, but if you pass this legislation, it'll probably keep you safe.
[00:39:26.191 --> 00:39:29.593]  And by its very definition, that is terrorism.
[00:39:31.154 --> 00:39:35.216]  By its very definition, that is terrorism.
[00:39:36.557 --> 00:39:37.198]  Bottom line.
[00:39:38.959 --> 00:39:39.919]  It's just that simple.
[00:39:43.121 --> 00:39:48.224]  And I, for one, am sick of it.
[00:39:48.244 --> 00:39:53.307]  I mean, the old definition of terrorism, you can go get it in a dictionary that's over ten years old.
[00:39:54.147 --> 00:39:57.829]  They started changing it like they're changing most of the other words now a few years ago.
[00:39:57.889 --> 00:40:10.415]  But to paraphrase it, it is to carry out a violent action or threaten a violent action against a group or individuals to try to force them to acquiesce to your political demands.
[00:40:11.535 --> 00:40:21.060]  And so what is it when the government's going, give up your rights, take a national ID card, let us take your freedoms away, give up your liberty for security, or the terrorists are going to kill you?
[00:40:26.152 --> 00:40:31.276]  And by the way, these men in black helmets with machine guns and black ski masks, they're the good guys.
[00:40:32.037 --> 00:40:36.660]  But you show children a picture of the police in the newspaper.
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:52.813]  I've got a big Time Life book from after 93, after the first World Trade Center bombing, and it shows these FBI agents in front of the World Trade Centers dressed like ringwraiths, black helmets, black masks, black everything, black Heckler and Koch submachine guns.
[00:40:54.234 --> 00:40:55.375]  And you show that to a group of
[00:40:56.175 --> 00:40:58.437]  Six-year-olds will all say, those are the bad men.
[00:40:58.477 --> 00:41:00.098]  That's the bad man.
[00:41:00.438 --> 00:41:02.039]  It's the archetypal Darth Vader.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:07.183]  I mean, again, you don't have to even be smart or grown up.
[00:41:08.484 --> 00:41:13.568]  You just have to not be totally programmed and brainwashed to not see what's right in front of us.
[00:41:15.929 --> 00:41:17.831]  And so the government's engaging in terrorism.
[00:41:20.132 --> 00:41:21.213]  Canyon in Texas.
[00:41:21.613 --> 00:41:22.214]  Go ahead, Canyon.
[00:41:22.234 --> 00:41:22.374]  Canyon.
[00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:24.190]  Hello, Alex.
[00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:24.910]  How are you doing today?
[00:41:25.111 --> 00:41:25.431]  Good, sir.
[00:41:25.451 --> 00:41:25.991]  Good to hear from you.
[00:41:26.671 --> 00:41:27.571]  Yeah, good to hear from you, too.
[00:41:27.631 --> 00:41:29.092]  I was just going to ask a few questions here.
[00:41:29.952 --> 00:41:39.475]  One, I'm visually impaired, actually legally blind, and I have been visiting your websites, and it seems that prisonplanet.tv has a few accessibility issues.
[00:41:39.555 --> 00:41:49.879]  I can get to most of the stuff, but there seems to be some links to images that just need a simple alt tag inserted so that the screen reader will recognize it.
[00:41:51.459 --> 00:41:52.780]  On another note, I was wondering...
[00:41:54.031 --> 00:42:00.515]  What country do you plan to move your family to in the event that things get really bad?
[00:42:01.996 --> 00:42:08.300]  I feel like I'm looking at Sodom and Gomorrah under a magnifying glass whenever I look at the way things are going in this nation.
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:17.145]  I can't talk about the way things are going with my family without being branded an ultra-right-wing conspiracy theorist and a fool.
[00:42:17.165 --> 00:42:21.828]  And they must be leftward then because if they were right-wingers, you'd be a commie.
[00:42:22.973 --> 00:42:28.117]  And again, this just shows how their paradigm of politics is so false and scrambled.
[00:42:28.497 --> 00:42:34.543]  Well, look, I mean, I have discussed on air that if stuff really keeps getting bad, I might move my family out of this country.
[00:42:35.343 --> 00:42:36.845]  I plan to stay here myself.
[00:42:37.665 --> 00:42:39.287]  But really, it's a new world order.
[00:42:39.327 --> 00:42:41.149]  There's nowhere to run long term.
[00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:43.371]  And there's a lot of countries.
[00:42:43.431 --> 00:42:45.372]  But they're all coming under tyranny as well.
[00:42:45.432 --> 00:42:46.133]  That's the problem.
[00:42:47.294 --> 00:42:49.496]  Well, I'm 19, and I was just thinking that
[00:42:49.932 --> 00:42:50.232]  I don't know.
[00:42:50.252 --> 00:42:51.593]  It's all individual and personal.
[00:43:20.157 --> 00:43:42.056]  To go back to your first comment, there's a lot we'd like to do with the websites to improve them, but I've got three full-time webmasters and another part-time webmaster, and I pay these individuals, and I don't pay them a lot, but you put four people together, that is a lot of money.
[00:43:42.817 --> 00:43:43.778]  And then I also...
[00:43:44.865 --> 00:43:46.747]  You know, we're trying our best.
[00:43:46.767 --> 00:43:52.231]  I mean, your suggestions are always well taken.
[00:43:53.211 --> 00:43:56.774]  And there's a lot of angles we'd like to cover.
[00:43:56.794 --> 00:44:04.179]  I mean, I personally, no exaggeration, work 16, 17 hours a day almost every day, six, seven days a week.
[00:44:04.779 --> 00:44:06.280]  And there's a lot more I'd like to do.
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:09.963]  I mean, I'm trying to produce these Arnold Schwarzenegger ads to run in California, what you need to do.
[00:44:10.523 --> 00:44:11.264]  I've done some of it.
[00:44:11.284 --> 00:44:12.425]  I'm trying to finish a film.
[00:44:13.183 --> 00:44:15.844]  I'm doing all these radio interviews left and right.
[00:44:16.445 --> 00:44:17.585]  I'm trying the best I can.
[00:44:18.306 --> 00:44:20.687]  Yeah, I see you're doing a very good job, and God bless you.
[00:44:21.047 --> 00:44:26.289]  Well, thank you for the call, and I would encourage you, sir, to write that book.
[00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:28.711]  Writing the book I don't think will be the hard part.
[00:44:29.471 --> 00:44:30.872]  You sound like an intelligent person.
[00:44:31.192 --> 00:44:32.332]  Getting it published will.
[00:44:32.372 --> 00:44:37.855]  That's why I printed my books myself, and Paul Watson's book that I hence published because I printed it up.
[00:44:39.682 --> 00:44:42.144]  Okay, let's go to Emmett in Pennsylvania.
[00:44:42.224 --> 00:44:42.944]  Emmett, you're on the air.
[00:44:42.984 --> 00:44:43.305]  Welcome.
[00:44:43.825 --> 00:44:47.167]  Yeah, go Eagles.
[00:44:47.187 --> 00:44:53.952]  Well, I've been following talk shows for years, ever since Chuck Harder and Bill Cooper and so on.
[00:44:54.032 --> 00:45:06.160]  And a buddy of mine who listens to Rush Limbaugh, although I can never listen to it, has told me that Mike Savage has attacked Rush Limbaugh and said he's a front for the Republican Party.
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:08.602]  Well, we know that, but good.
[00:45:10.951 --> 00:45:18.396]  Well, that's... Again, that's... I mean, this whole thing you brought up, I could talk for an hour about talk radio, and this is how it works.
[00:45:20.157 --> 00:45:20.598]  Okay.
[00:45:20.758 --> 00:45:21.198]  Okay.
[00:45:21.218 --> 00:45:21.518]  No.
[00:45:21.558 --> 00:45:21.838]  Duh.
[00:45:21.918 --> 00:45:24.080]  All right.
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:30.925]  One of the universities around Philadelphia is advertising a course in Star Trek.
[00:45:31.605 --> 00:45:37.389]  They're going to go episode by episode, study religion, philosophy, and everything of each show.
[00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:38.590]  Oh...
[00:45:40.663 --> 00:45:43.224]  Imagine saying, oh, I got an A in Star Trek.
[00:45:43.324 --> 00:45:45.705]  Well, that's a lot better than some of the classes they've got.
[00:45:46.165 --> 00:45:47.406]  Is it a philosophy class?
[00:45:47.626 --> 00:45:47.926]  Yes.
[00:45:48.567 --> 00:45:51.548]  Well, that actually is a good place for stuff like that.
[00:45:51.988 --> 00:45:52.448]  Okay.
[00:45:52.808 --> 00:46:03.373]  And under Patriot Act II, are they going to come around and confiscate my books like Rule by Secrecy by Jim Mars and Tragedy and Hope by Carol Quigley?
[00:46:05.294 --> 00:46:07.195]  No, sir, I don't think that's what's going to happen.
[00:46:08.015 --> 00:46:08.415]  All right.
[00:46:08.495 --> 00:46:09.516]  Do you want me to comment on it?
[00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:11.410]  Okay.
[00:46:11.911 --> 00:46:16.055]  Because earlier you brought up a point, but I didn't know if you wanted me to comment on that Rush Limbaugh comment.
[00:46:17.096 --> 00:46:17.877]  Yeah, that's okay.
[00:46:17.917 --> 00:46:18.478]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:46:18.798 --> 00:46:28.267]  Well, just that Michael Savage, who has acted like he's more of a conservative than ultra-commy Limbaugh, and I mean that when I say it, by the way.
[00:46:28.548 --> 00:46:29.429]  Yes.
[00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:32.712]  The people they support in the policies are actually the opposite of what they say.
[00:46:33.396 --> 00:46:37.298]  You know, that is, it's a lot of skullduggery and manipulation going on.
[00:46:37.738 --> 00:46:42.720]  You know, Michael Savage, I've heard him say, George Bush is the guardian of all that's good.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:44.300]  He is fighting the New World War.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.261]  I've actually heard him say that.
[00:46:45.621 --> 00:46:48.422]  Put people that disagree with the government in forced labor camps.
[00:46:48.982 --> 00:46:49.922]  You know, blah, blah, blah.
[00:46:50.683 --> 00:47:01.387]  And because so many people are pulling out of Rush Limbaugh's control and Michael Weiner Savage's control and Laura Ingraham's control and actually going, wait a minute.
[00:47:01.983 --> 00:47:09.650]  You guys have got total control of the government, and the age of big government's begun, and wait a minute, you're going after my guns, and wait a minute, you're for UNESCO, and you're for the free trade area.
[00:47:10.131 --> 00:47:27.067]  So Savage is trying to keep his cutting edge position, and I have actually, I do listen to talk radio when I'm driving around doing errands, and I have heard him attacking Limbaugh, and he's doing that because he knows that that resonates with the grassroots conservatives that know we've been betrayed, as Ron Paul has said.
[00:47:28.297 --> 00:47:33.299]  But again, it's just, you know, with Savage, it's just another version of Limbaugh.
[00:47:33.819 --> 00:47:40.322]  I mean, Limbaugh is consciously trying to deceive and manipulate.
[00:47:41.583 --> 00:47:45.144]  And again, folks, that doesn't mean that he isn't right about the, quote, liberals.
[00:47:45.224 --> 00:47:53.988]  But then it's the other side of his message, defending Bush, absconding the truth, hiding it, manipulating it.
[00:47:54.008 --> 00:47:56.489]  I mean, it's so complex to listen to that guy
[00:47:57.245 --> 00:48:00.166]  I mean, he is very sophisticated.
[00:48:00.206 --> 00:48:12.870]  Limbaugh is actually a triple speaker, quadruple speaker, quadruple super quad, double talker, double speaker, new thinker.
[00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:21.113]  I mean, he makes the English Ingsoc new version, 11th version, out of 1984 look tame in comparison.
[00:48:21.613 --> 00:48:25.634]  I mean, the lying and manipulation is so complex that it's hard to even deal with.
[00:48:26.536 --> 00:48:30.438]  I mean, I listen to it with my mouth hanging open, and the average person just can't defend against it.
[00:48:32.439 --> 00:48:35.940]  Have you ever listened to the last day prophet, Brother Stare?
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:40.222]  No, I really don't listen to that.
[00:48:40.322 --> 00:48:44.064]  Well, he's really right down on it about the dollar going up.
[00:48:45.093 --> 00:48:47.074]  Under against the Euro and so on.
[00:48:47.294 --> 00:48:49.654]  Oh, yeah, that wasn't... Hey, listen, thank you for calling me.
[00:48:49.674 --> 00:48:50.634]  Yeah, thank you.
[00:48:50.894 --> 00:48:51.915]  I appreciate the call.
[00:48:52.275 --> 00:48:57.636]  I mean, the World Economic Forum three and a half years ago said they were going to deep six the dollar.
[00:48:57.696 --> 00:49:00.736]  I mean, people think I've got a crystal ball because I predicted all this.
[00:49:00.816 --> 00:49:07.498]  It's really not... If you're paying attention, folks, what I do is really not that amazing.
[00:49:09.698 --> 00:49:12.439]  And sometimes I really find it mind-boggling to...
[00:49:14.797 --> 00:49:18.098]  To not be able to figure out why the yuppies can't see what's happening.
[00:49:18.558 --> 00:49:20.719]  But again, they feel like they're members of the establishment.
[00:49:21.539 --> 00:49:23.000]  I talked about this last week.
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:32.163]  I talked about how... Well, number one, the people want to hear the truth.
[00:49:34.263 --> 00:49:39.745]  And the people, whether they're liberals or conservatives, are beginning to realize that liberal or conservative is just labels.
[00:49:41.165 --> 00:49:42.746]  And so before the election, the...
[00:49:43.624 --> 00:49:46.685]  The Limbaughs and the Savages wouldn't criticize Bush.
[00:49:49.126 --> 00:49:51.346]  Because that was out of favor with the establishment.
[00:49:51.366 --> 00:49:56.388]  But then after the election, when it doesn't really count, they can do some criticism and try to sure up their base.
[00:49:56.828 --> 00:49:58.909]  That is, the listeners that are not completely stupid.
[00:50:00.589 --> 00:50:01.790]  And so that's what they're doing there.
[00:50:02.310 --> 00:50:11.893]  I mean, I heard Limbaugh a few weeks ago, when Congress had passed the Patriot Act and Patriot Act II and the National ID Card, the Intelligence Bill,
[00:50:13.374 --> 00:50:15.615]  I heard him go, man, the Republicans really want a victory.
[00:50:15.895 --> 00:50:16.995]  This defeated the liberals.
[00:50:17.495 --> 00:50:18.635]  Man, the liberals are angry.
[00:50:19.276 --> 00:50:21.936]  And I went, wait a minute, more Democrats voted for it than Republicans.
[00:50:22.516 --> 00:50:31.419]  And as I'm thinking that, Limbaugh knows that a sizable portion of his audience knows that, so he doubles back and says, yes, yes, the Democrats really wanted this.
[00:50:31.759 --> 00:50:32.579]  Ha, ha, ha.
[00:50:32.819 --> 00:50:34.259]  But they didn't know this was in there.
[00:50:34.879 --> 00:50:36.140]  Oh, yeah, they just helped write it.
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:37.660]  It was slipped in by Bush.
[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:38.500]  Oh, he tricked them.
[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:39.100]  Ha, ha, ha.
[00:50:40.021 --> 00:50:40.901]  So he added that.
[00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:49.616]  Then he added another layer to that, and it was just like... It was all about making you feel good as a listener, like your football team had won or something.
[00:50:49.897 --> 00:50:52.098]  But that was only one level to the propaganda.
[00:50:53.339 --> 00:50:55.641]  It was just... It was sick.
[00:50:56.302 --> 00:50:56.962]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.218 --> 00:51:08.065]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.385 --> 00:51:09.747]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:09.967 --> 00:51:12.169]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:14.411]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:14.672 --> 00:51:19.616]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:19.957 --> 00:51:23.981]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.221 --> 00:51:26.002]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.082 --> 00:51:36.730]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:38.791]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:51:38.971 --> 00:51:42.834]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today and man the guns of the Infowar.

[00:52:00.524 --> 00:52:08.790]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.031 --> 00:52:13.394]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:13.694 --> 00:52:22.601]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:22.801 --> 00:52:26.444]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:26.704 --> 00:52:31.753]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.054 --> 00:52:38.786]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:52:39.266 --> 00:52:39.807]  What about you?
[00:52:40.544 --> 00:52:45.907]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:54:08.675 --> 00:54:14.440]  Folks, I'm going to try to boil this down.
[00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:16.022]  I mean, really, it's giving me a headache.
[00:54:17.042 --> 00:54:17.983]  I'm going to try to boil this down.
[00:54:18.704 --> 00:54:20.605]  I am not a Republican or a Democrat.
[00:54:22.287 --> 00:54:25.409]  I have an allegiance to the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
[00:54:27.011 --> 00:54:31.054]  I have an allegiance to my family, first and foremost.
[00:54:31.074 --> 00:54:33.356]  And because I have an allegiance to my family,
[00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:42.106]  Then I have allegiance to the Bill of Rights and Constitution because that makes a good country and a good place for my family to be raised.
[00:54:44.748 --> 00:54:54.776]  And so I don't go into politics like it's the Eagles versus the Cowboys or Coke versus Pepsi or Ford versus Chevy.
[00:54:56.778 --> 00:54:58.599]  And that's how most people look at politics.
[00:54:58.659 --> 00:54:59.180]  It's, you know, it's...
[00:54:59.895 --> 00:55:07.542]  I mean, they even have best-selling T-shirts and bumper stickers now that are George Bush on the side of a football helmet, and it's a football team.
[00:55:08.683 --> 00:55:11.005]  You know, oh, we won the Super Bowl again.
[00:55:11.045 --> 00:55:13.587]  I mean, it's even being phrased as that.
[00:55:15.809 --> 00:55:17.811]  Well, here's the analogy then.
[00:55:18.171 --> 00:55:21.354]  The same owner owns both the football teams.
[00:55:22.915 --> 00:55:24.677]  And so the teams go out and play...
[00:55:25.467 --> 00:55:30.328]  And then we've caught the owner, not just owning both teams, but also having players rig things.
[00:55:30.928 --> 00:55:35.349]  And in the key, sudden death overtime, fumbling the ball on purpose.
[00:55:36.809 --> 00:55:37.889]  There's your analogy.
[00:55:37.909 --> 00:55:42.810]  We've caught the owner of the team gambling, making money, insider trading.
[00:55:45.531 --> 00:55:51.032]  And so my allegiance, I hope your allegiance, is to freedom.
[00:55:52.049 --> 00:55:57.613]  I don't approach a politician or a piece of legislation by how the media is framing it.
[00:55:58.073 --> 00:56:01.055]  Oh, conservatives may have a victory and get the Patriot Act too.
[00:56:01.995 --> 00:56:03.296]  It's very conservative.
[00:56:03.596 --> 00:56:06.478]  Conservatives may have a victory and get the Free Trade Area of the Americas.
[00:56:07.839 --> 00:56:10.481]  And then you look at conservatives, 80 plus percent against it.
[00:56:11.101 --> 00:56:12.682]  Well, what conservatives are you talking about?
[00:56:12.702 --> 00:56:14.503]  You know, the liberals aren't for it either.
[00:56:16.024 --> 00:56:19.667]  So you've got Team Washington against Team America.
[00:56:19.767 --> 00:56:20.167]  Team America.
[00:56:21.599 --> 00:56:23.200]  Joe Sixpack, Sally Soccer Mom.
[00:56:23.401 --> 00:56:24.882]  But they haven't figured that out yet.
[00:56:24.902 --> 00:56:29.345]  They haven't figured out that they're watching a theatrical production.
[00:56:30.566 --> 00:56:34.209]  That the real battle isn't a game at all, but is life and death.
[00:56:34.449 --> 00:56:35.951]  And that this country is being dismantled.
[00:56:38.673 --> 00:56:40.574]  And so my allegiance is to freedom.
[00:56:41.475 --> 00:56:43.157]  The real choice isn't left or right.
[00:56:43.277 --> 00:56:51.103]  It's total dehumanization and enslavement and feudalism, serfdom, versus liberty and freedom.
[00:56:52.091 --> 00:56:53.452]  And so I'm with liberty and freedom.
[00:56:54.553 --> 00:56:55.633]  And George Bush is not.
[00:56:56.674 --> 00:56:59.676]  And neither is John Kerry or Al Gore or any of these people.
[00:56:59.936 --> 00:57:01.397]  And there's no lesser of two evils.
[00:57:01.737 --> 00:57:02.938]  The whole thing is fake.
[00:57:03.098 --> 00:57:03.918]  It is a fraud.
[00:57:05.079 --> 00:57:09.982]  And by the way, the best film I've got that exposes this is Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:57:10.202 --> 00:57:14.765]  American Dictators does it too, but Police State 3 Total Enslavement is 2 hours 44 minutes long.
[00:57:17.535 --> 00:57:19.436]  And it shows how the parties are the same.
[00:57:19.716 --> 00:57:20.797]  Who the CFR is.
[00:57:20.857 --> 00:57:21.898]  What the New World Order is.
[00:57:22.138 --> 00:57:22.998]  Who PNAC is.
[00:57:23.499 --> 00:57:24.459]  How they operate.
[00:57:24.639 --> 00:57:26.961]  And then it gives you basically the whole New World Order.
[00:57:30.623 --> 00:57:32.925]  You need to get Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:57:33.365 --> 00:57:35.526]  The more I think about it, it may be my best film.
[00:57:36.367 --> 00:57:41.630]  I mean, for high production quality and giving you the history of government-sponsored terrorism, Road to Tyranny is it.
[00:57:43.711 --> 00:57:46.293]  My new film, American Dictators, is excellent as well.
[00:57:48.652 --> 00:57:52.935]  And you can call toll-free and get my videos here for a few more days.
[00:57:52.955 --> 00:57:55.096]  I'll extend it out just a few more days.

[00:58:57.676 --> 00:58:58.337]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.997 --> 00:58:59.959]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.743 --> 00:59:01.824]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.484 --> 00:59:03.325]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.066 --> 00:59:04.966]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.986 --> 00:59:09.610]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:13.953]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.316 --> 00:59:19.136]  Hello, my friends.
[00:59:19.277 --> 00:59:21.618]  It is Monday, the 20th day of December 2004.
[00:59:21.658 --> 00:59:23.760]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:59:25.811 --> 00:59:27.792]  We've got two hours left in the broadcast.
[00:59:28.232 --> 00:59:31.673]  I want to get into thought crime, and we'll take your calls on this subject.
[00:59:33.573 --> 00:59:34.873]  And I want to be clear on this.
[00:59:36.474 --> 00:59:39.435]  We have had him on as guests dozens of times.
[00:59:39.475 --> 00:59:55.519]  We've defended when members of the so-called left get arrested for peace on earth shirts at the mall they bought there, or somebody's out protesting amongst hundreds of Bush supporters on a public sidewalk, and the police come and arrest someone who has a no blood for oil or down with a George Bush sign.
[00:59:56.969 --> 00:59:57.529]  It's horrible.
[00:59:58.390 --> 01:00:01.012]  But folks, they just get a few months in jail.
[01:00:02.873 --> 01:00:09.657]  With Christians, this started with Butch Reno, the butcher of Waco, Janet Reno.
[01:00:09.677 --> 01:00:19.403]  This started really with her, with these racketeering laws, where pro-life demonstrators, 100 feet away, sitting on the sidewalk.
[01:00:19.663 --> 01:00:21.124]  By the way, I have video of this.
[01:00:22.104 --> 01:00:24.766]  Of them breaking Catholic priest arms, beating up
[01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:29.532]  Baptist preachers spraying mace in women's faces with babies in their arms.
[01:00:30.873 --> 01:00:32.755]  I mean, brutal stuff, folks.
[01:00:33.916 --> 01:00:37.439]  They let the pro-abortion people stand around them, chanting and spitting on them.
[01:00:38.456 --> 01:00:39.937]  By the way, George Woolley has that video.
[01:00:40.017 --> 01:00:43.841]  I aired that years ago on my cable show locally, and I mean to get in touch with him.
[01:00:44.081 --> 01:00:44.761]  I can't find it.
[01:00:44.781 --> 01:00:45.922]  I want to get that video again.
[01:00:46.323 --> 01:00:50.887]  It was a documentary made about how the ACLU doesn't help Christian conservatives.
[01:00:51.307 --> 01:00:56.451]  That was the basis of the hour-long film, but it's an hour of Christians being beaten and their arms broken.
[01:00:56.471 --> 01:01:00.555]  I mean, with nunchucks twisting the arm until it snaps to make you get up.
[01:01:01.996 --> 01:01:02.596]  You've seen the...
[01:01:04.893 --> 01:01:10.415]  Environmental protesters having their eyes swabbed with mace, pepper spray.
[01:01:10.655 --> 01:01:12.315]  This is 100 times worse than that.
[01:01:12.595 --> 01:01:17.517]  And I'm against the famous video of the protesters having their eyes swabbed.
[01:01:19.177 --> 01:01:20.458]  But it's getting worse and worse.
[01:01:20.738 --> 01:01:27.420]  And in England and in France, they're passing laws where if you criticize homosexuals in any way, you are arrested.
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:32.101]  Two years in prison in France, and it calculates out from a euro to $62,000.
[01:01:35.484 --> 01:01:38.105]  That was last week past a week ago in France.
[01:01:38.746 --> 01:01:43.208]  I've interviewed again BBC reporters that are arrested.
[01:01:43.968 --> 01:01:46.710]  And I'm going to repeat all this again with our guests, because this is the picture.
[01:01:47.130 --> 01:01:59.416]  BBC reporter, the host of One Man and His Dog, went to a rural affairs meeting, gave a speech, saying rural communities deserve the same rights as homosexuals and Muslims.
[01:02:00.712 --> 01:02:05.594]  And Scotland Yard came out and arrested him and said the word homosexual is derogatory.
[01:02:08.395 --> 01:02:11.296]  We're going to break here in a moment, and then we're going to have our guest on.
[01:02:11.336 --> 01:02:12.636]  We'll just have this quick break.
[01:02:13.636 --> 01:02:16.097]  And Pennsylvania's passed laws like this.
[01:02:16.197 --> 01:02:17.137]  Other states have done it.
[01:02:18.358 --> 01:02:21.099]  And it's really scary, and the average American isn't aware of this.
[01:02:22.579 --> 01:02:27.741]  Christians face 47 years in prison for reading Bible, praying on street,
[01:02:29.551 --> 01:02:30.571]  And this is documented.
[01:02:31.531 --> 01:02:38.133]  You read Old Testament passages condemning homosexuality, you get arrested.
[01:02:38.173 --> 01:02:49.915]  And again, whether you agree with these statements or not, and I'm a Christian, I believe in the Bible, or whether you're an atheist, do you believe in the First Amendment?
[01:02:52.075 --> 01:02:53.615]  Do you believe in the First Amendment?
[01:02:53.635 --> 01:02:56.276]  Do you believe in these groups' rights to march?
[01:02:56.296 --> 01:02:58.236]  Do you believe in the other groups' rights to protest them?
[01:03:00.285 --> 01:03:12.273]  So we're going to break and we'll come back and talk to an American hero who is facing, ladies and gentlemen, who is facing years in prison.
[01:03:14.094 --> 01:03:17.357]  You do not want to miss this interview that's coming up.
[01:03:19.818 --> 01:03:29.405]  And it's so sad, this interview with Michael Markavich of Repent America, who is facing up to 47 years in jail for protesting at Outfest.
[01:03:31.039 --> 01:03:36.703]  And all the left out there listening, you know, we defend your free speech.
[01:03:37.604 --> 01:03:43.688]  You should defend Mr. Mark Cabbages and all the others that are facing 47 years in prison speech.
[01:03:45.049 --> 01:03:47.871]  We'll be right back on the other side, InfoWars.com.
[01:03:48.231 --> 01:03:49.792]  Don't forget PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:03:49.912 --> 01:03:52.174]  Stay with us.
[01:03:53.875 --> 01:03:56.737]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:03:57.458 --> 01:03:58.760]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:04.708]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:04:04.968 --> 01:04:10.235]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:04:10.536 --> 01:04:12.198]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order of
[01:04:13.398 --> 01:04:18.621]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:04:18.881 --> 01:04:23.483]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:04:23.603 --> 01:04:26.364]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[01:04:26.684 --> 01:04:29.865]  Psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.905 --> 01:04:31.726]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:04:49.959 --> 01:04:52.061]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:04:53.101 --> 01:04:55.983]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:04:56.343 --> 01:04:59.204]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:04:59.444 --> 01:05:05.648]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[01:05:06.008 --> 01:05:13.332]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.

[01:05:54.855 --> 01:06:00.340]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:06:00.761 --> 01:06:05.005]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:06:05.225 --> 01:06:12.272]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:06:12.652 --> 01:06:18.758]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:06:18.898 --> 01:06:20.119]  There are no side effects.
[01:06:20.259 --> 01:06:20.760]  We're good to go.
[01:06:37.222 --> 01:06:40.384]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.

[01:06:41.265 --> 01:06:43.126]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:06:43.166 --> 01:06:43.547]  Call today.
[01:06:43.807 --> 01:06:45.488]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:45.508 --> 01:06:47.629]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:47.669 --> 01:06:49.731]  This broadcast is not about left or right, my friends.
[01:07:07.619 --> 01:07:11.541]  I look at issues according to freedom, human liberty, and dignity.
[01:07:13.882 --> 01:07:18.263]  And regardless of what party you have in office, we're just losing more and more of those basic rights.
[01:07:19.464 --> 01:07:22.125]  Now, again, before the break, I know a lot of stations carry the news.
[01:07:22.165 --> 01:07:28.107]  I went over the fact that BBC reporters that criticize even use the word homosexual are arrested.
[01:07:29.168 --> 01:07:32.309]  That word is illegal in England now if it's not used properly.
[01:07:34.128 --> 01:07:37.891]  In France, 60 plus thousand dollar fines, years in prison.
[01:07:38.852 --> 01:07:49.121]  Pennsylvania, a couple years ago, passed a law where preachers, if they read Old Testament passages, can be held accountable for creating the root of a hate crime.
[01:07:49.201 --> 01:07:54.726]  Even if someone doesn't follow what they said and do something violent, still just saying it's a crime.
[01:07:54.966 --> 01:07:55.827]  This is thought crime.
[01:07:57.768 --> 01:08:02.532]  And, again, they're arresting pro-life demonstrators, anti-war demonstrators.
[01:08:03.112 --> 01:08:04.994]  All over, people are losing their freedoms.
[01:08:06.415 --> 01:08:08.577]  We're becoming what you'd call Communist China.
[01:08:10.178 --> 01:08:12.640]  And a lot of conservatives laugh when the liberals get arrested.
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:16.063]  A lot of liberals laugh when conservatives get arrested.
[01:08:16.723 --> 01:08:18.725]  We better get together on the First Amendment.
[01:08:19.305 --> 01:08:20.206]  And we better do it now.
[01:08:20.546 --> 01:08:25.010]  Headline, Christians face 47 years in prison for reading Bible, praying on street...
[01:08:26.921 --> 01:08:47.256]  And it says, after a federal appeals court denied an emergency appeal to stop proposition the prosecution of 11 Christians, Philadelphia Municipal Court Judge William Austin Meehan ordered four of the Christians to stand trial on three felony criminal conspiracy, ethnic intimidation, and riot, and five misdemeanor charges.
[01:08:47.436 --> 01:08:50.418]  If convicted, they could face up to 47 years in prison.
[01:08:51.092 --> 01:08:51.472]  We're good to go.
[01:09:12.904 --> 01:09:24.106]  And to give us details of this is one of the people who's facing 47 years in prison and massive fines, and that's Michael Markavage, the head of Repent America.
[01:09:24.806 --> 01:09:26.046]  Michael, thank you for joining us.
[01:09:26.566 --> 01:09:27.247]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:09:28.507 --> 01:09:33.228]  Just tell us about your organization, the website, and blow by blow, you've got the floor.
[01:09:33.508 --> 01:09:34.468]  What happened that day?
[01:09:35.108 --> 01:09:35.688]  Absolutely.
[01:09:35.868 --> 01:09:40.309]  Repent America, we're an evangelistic organization based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
[01:09:41.062 --> 01:09:45.943]  And we're here to go out into the public square and proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[01:09:46.764 --> 01:10:01.948]  And this on October 10th happened to be a homosexual organization that established this yearly event called Outfest where thousands upon thousands of homosexuals gather in the city of Philadelphia to celebrate their sin.
[01:10:02.508 --> 01:10:08.250]  So what we did as Christians went there to evangelize and as we were at this event
[01:10:08.652 --> 01:10:14.535]  We were met with great opposition by a group, a militant mob of homosexuals called the Pink Angels.
[01:10:15.236 --> 01:10:23.480]  And they held big placards about 10 feet in the air and encircled us and followed us around the event blowing ear-piercing whistles.
[01:10:24.381 --> 01:10:36.948]  And the police at first did break a barricade that they put there and we're simply coming in there and we were singing Blessed Be the Name of the Lord as a cross-dresser was dancing on the stage and
[01:10:37.509 --> 01:10:40.312]  We had went to where the police said we can go.
[01:10:40.332 --> 01:10:44.115]  They said that we can go anywhere we want, public sidewalk, public street.
[01:10:44.936 --> 01:10:46.958]  So we decided we would just go across the street.
[01:10:46.978 --> 01:10:48.639]  We didn't want to be too close to the stage.
[01:10:48.679 --> 01:10:49.520]  It was loud.
[01:10:50.221 --> 01:10:55.566]  But everywhere we went, we were met by this opposition, and the police did nothing to stop the obstruction.
[01:10:55.606 --> 01:11:01.631]  Instead, what they did is they got us to a specific area and brought in the paddy wagons
[01:11:03.852 --> 01:11:22.100]  By the way, even the mainstream media admits that you guys didn't touch anybody, didn't do anything.
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:29.864]  And I've been at Million Mom marches where in front of the police, they hit me in the head with signs, cussed at me.
[01:11:30.704 --> 01:11:32.485]  One time they did arrest a Million Marcher.
[01:11:33.357 --> 01:11:37.538]  She jumped the curb with her car, drove it up over the curb, was honking.
[01:11:37.818 --> 01:11:39.579]  John Statmiller was standing right next to me.
[01:11:40.039 --> 01:11:41.319]  This is all on video, by the way.
[01:11:41.339 --> 01:11:42.360]  I've aired this on TV.
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:43.880]  Why haven't I put this in a film?
[01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:52.403]  She jumps the curb, starts honking her horn, and the police did come over and arrest her for that, threatening to run me over with a car.
[01:11:53.443 --> 01:11:57.104]  Yeah, these groups get very, very aggressive, but never seem to get in trouble.
[01:11:58.090 --> 01:11:59.151]  It is remarkable.
[01:11:59.671 --> 01:12:06.636]  And in Philadelphia, they have a special unit called the Civil Affairs Unit, and they're supposed to specifically deal with civil rights.
[01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:15.542]  So we would expect them, obviously, to know the law and know that we have every right, as they had said when we first arrived, to go anywhere we wanted because it's public streets and public sidewalks.
[01:12:16.082 --> 01:12:16.863]  But you're right.
[01:12:16.903 --> 01:12:24.328]  They don't address the actual people who are committing crime, who are disorderly, who are obstructing, who are impeding people's way and rights.
[01:12:24.838 --> 01:12:28.421]  It's certainly remarkable as to how they handled this whole entire situation.
[01:12:29.362 --> 01:12:49.518]  Well, it turns out that we get charged under Pennsylvania's hate crime law, which is called ethnic intimidation, meaning that if we intimidate someone, and obviously there's a prerequisite at this time in Pennsylvania, you have to commit a different type of an act, and they have on us reckless endangerment of another person,
[01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:57.611]  Which is what they have to actually have some type of other charge prior to charging us with the ethnic intimidation charge.
[01:12:57.631 --> 01:13:07.513]  I don't even know if that one qualifies, but I'm mentioning that because they did charge us with that ethnic intimidation, which is a felony of the second degree.
[01:13:08.513 --> 01:13:14.394]  And they charge us with criminal conspiracy, riot, and the charges go on.
[01:13:14.954 --> 01:13:19.535]  So now what someone does sexually is ethnic, is a race.
[01:13:20.672 --> 01:13:22.594]  Yeah, it's quite interesting.
[01:13:22.614 --> 01:13:32.726]  They throw it in there with race, color, religion, and then they just throw this, based on who you have sex with, that's the new protected class of people.
[01:13:32.986 --> 01:13:38.913]  And so, listen, I've been sent emails by major news organizations.
[01:13:39.454 --> 01:13:41.316]  When I criticized Arnold Schwarzenegger,
[01:13:42.599 --> 01:13:44.640]  For wanting to run for president and his policies.
[01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:48.641]  I got an email back from a news director going, I'm going to report you to the FBI.
[01:13:48.961 --> 01:13:52.282]  By criticizing Arnold, you may incite something.
[01:13:52.722 --> 01:13:54.963]  This may be the root of a hate crime.
[01:13:57.524 --> 01:14:02.725]  So everything we ever heard about how they're going to use this for thought crime is now happening.
[01:14:02.765 --> 01:14:05.366]  So when they came up and arrested you, what did they tell you?
[01:14:06.269 --> 01:14:18.817]  Well, I had asked specifically as the director and trying to cooperate with the police as best as possible, although they were kind of interfering with our evangelistic ministry by following us around as well.
[01:14:19.177 --> 01:14:25.702]  They didn't give us any space and obviously didn't deal with the people who were actually blocking and impeding our way and obstructing us.
[01:14:26.982 --> 01:14:28.443]  They didn't tell us anything.
[01:14:28.463 --> 01:14:30.465]  They just said, you're all under arrest.
[01:14:31.325 --> 01:14:35.548]  And they had the paddy wagons come to this specific area and pick us up and take us away.
[01:14:35.993 --> 01:14:42.738]  And what's remarkable about this whole thing is we had video footage from the very beginning of when we entered this event to the very end.
[01:14:42.758 --> 01:14:47.482]  There was an independent film company that was with us doing a documentary on our ministry.
[01:14:47.942 --> 01:14:48.643]  I was wired.
[01:14:49.083 --> 01:14:52.326]  All the conversations between myself and the police are on tape.
[01:14:52.906 --> 01:14:56.169]  And this was showed in the courtroom in front of Judge Meehan.
[01:14:56.889 --> 01:15:05.176]  And simply because Judge Meehan did not see the other people on the videotape because that's when he dismissed the charges against all the women
[01:15:05.894 --> 01:15:07.155]  And two of the men.
[01:15:07.936 --> 01:15:15.081]  Every time he would see someone on the tape, he would turn to the defense table and see if that person is there and make a note.
[01:15:15.101 --> 01:15:28.250]  So once that was all done in the courtroom, he decided that there's enough basis for us to go to trial, and myself included, on three felonies and five misdemeanors.
[01:15:29.311 --> 01:15:32.033]  It is absolutely astounding to think that the judge...
[01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:39.502]  Now, what are they claiming is the enacting offense to then use the hate crime law?
[01:15:40.863 --> 01:15:45.424]  Yes, there is a prerequisite to enact that ethnic intimidation.
[01:15:45.464 --> 01:15:49.145]  Now, the other three people... But what are they claiming you did to trigger that?
[01:15:49.865 --> 01:15:51.666]  Well, the thing is, they didn't.
[01:15:51.706 --> 01:16:02.149]  They put their one witness on the stand, the Commonwealth, put their one witness on the stand, and we asked them, well, in cross-examination, well, what exactly did they do
[01:16:02.779 --> 01:16:04.441]  Now, who was the state's witness?
[01:16:16.972 --> 01:16:22.617]  The Chief Inspector James Piano, he's the head of the Civil Affairs Unit in Philadelphia.
[01:16:22.677 --> 01:16:23.197]  So perfect.
[01:16:23.237 --> 01:16:24.898]  They've got the police there as a witness.
[01:16:24.978 --> 01:16:25.899]  No one's been harmed.
[01:16:26.159 --> 01:16:34.666]  They can't even get one of the other demonstrations to sign stuff against you, so they have a cop come out and do it.
[01:16:34.686 --> 01:16:36.187]  I mean, folks, listen.
[01:16:36.207 --> 01:16:37.689]  Do you hear what you're listening to?
[01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:39.250]  They didn't do anything.
[01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:40.391]  They didn't touch anybody.
[01:16:40.411 --> 01:16:43.433]  They sang hymns, and they're facing 47 years in prison.
[01:16:48.735 --> 01:16:49.536]  I'm just speechless.
[01:16:49.576 --> 01:16:50.436]  So what came next?
[01:16:51.637 --> 01:16:53.078]  Well, let me just say this.
[01:16:53.559 --> 01:17:02.766]  If people still don't believe what I'm saying, they could view the entire video footage of what happened at our website, which is repentamerica.com.
[01:17:02.846 --> 01:17:06.088]  It's www.repentamerica.com.
[01:17:06.649 --> 01:17:14.755]  And I think it was definitely God's providence that we had an actual film crew taping this whole thing from two different camera angles.
[01:17:15.177 --> 01:17:17.859]  And having audio of this whole situation.
[01:17:17.899 --> 01:17:27.587]  But now we do face trial because the judge thought that the words we were using, such as repent, are fighting words.
[01:17:28.067 --> 01:17:29.909]  And that was the Commonwealth's argument.
[01:17:30.549 --> 01:17:43.560]  And in the closing argument by the Commonwealth, this prosecutor went into a fit of rage, declaring us as hateful and disgusting people and deserving to be charged with all these crimes.
[01:17:44.096 --> 01:17:46.118]  So it is absolutely astounding.
[01:17:46.238 --> 01:17:49.342]  So he's actually engaging in hate crimes in the courtroom.
[01:17:50.343 --> 01:17:51.324]  Well, exactly.
[01:17:51.364 --> 01:17:55.589]  You know, when you think about this ethnic intimidation, it does cover religion.
[01:17:55.709 --> 01:18:03.117]  Well, folks, we always heard it was going to be, if you go shoot a black person in hateful, racist rage, you get a greater charge.
[01:18:03.157 --> 01:18:03.978]  And we said, wait a minute.
[01:18:04.585 --> 01:18:12.409]  Killing somebody is hateful to begin with, whether it's a black guy killing a black guy, or a white guy killing a white guy, or a white woman killing a black guy, whatever.
[01:18:12.849 --> 01:18:13.570]  It's the same thing.
[01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:18.332]  They said, oh, no, no, this is just for crimes that actually take place.
[01:18:18.632 --> 01:18:22.154]  But see, now it's, oh, you hurt people's feelings.
[01:18:22.434 --> 01:18:24.295]  You're facing 47 years in prison.
[01:18:24.495 --> 01:18:27.317]  Folks, this is actually happening in America.
[01:18:29.890 --> 01:18:38.055]  When we get back, sir, I want to talk more about your website, your organization, and this is going to trial, and what this means for this country.
[01:18:39.076 --> 01:18:46.260]  And by the way, what's going to happen, Democrats, when you go protest Republicans and the court says, oh, what you said was hateful.
[01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:49.302]  You're going to have to spend 47 years in prison now.
[01:18:49.802 --> 01:18:50.543]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:50.563 --> 01:18:50.963]  Stay with us.
[01:18:54.522 --> 01:19:01.828]  The media is flooded with reports of everything from antibiotic-resistant super germs to the possibility of a flu epidemic due to a vaccine shortage.
[01:19:02.189 --> 01:19:06.872]  If we can't rely on traditional medicines, what are you going to do to keep you and your family healthy and safe?
[01:19:07.092 --> 01:19:10.975]  There is now a scientifically proven alternative called Super Silver Solution.
[01:19:11.196 --> 01:19:14.138]  Super Silver's combination of supercharged silver and oxygen
[01:19:14.498 --> 01:19:30.124]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[01:19:30.464 --> 01:19:36.746]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.

[01:19:53.206 --> 01:19:59.410]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:19:59.870 --> 01:20:07.656]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:20:07.996 --> 01:20:15.841]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:20:16.141 --> 01:20:20.903]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:20:21.243 --> 01:20:30.306]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:31.826]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[01:22:57.771 --> 01:22:58.392]  All right, folks.
[01:22:58.432 --> 01:22:58.972]  We're back live.
[01:22:59.052 --> 01:23:02.455]  I'm actually somewhat speechless here, which you know is very rare.
[01:23:02.555 --> 01:23:03.436]  In America, they admit...
[01:23:26.604 --> 01:23:33.228]  That this group of Christians did absolutely nothing wrong in the classical sense.
[01:23:33.248 --> 01:23:34.448]  They didn't touch anybody.
[01:23:34.829 --> 01:23:35.849]  They didn't do anything.
[01:23:35.889 --> 01:23:39.451]  They went out on a sidewalk and preached the gospel.
[01:23:41.733 --> 01:23:43.654]  And that's their First Amendment right.
[01:23:44.254 --> 01:23:50.678]  And now they've been hauled into court, and they're facing 47 years in prison.
[01:23:52.278 --> 01:23:54.960]  And all over America, stuff like this is happening.
[01:23:58.297 --> 01:23:59.598]  This is really going on.
[01:23:59.938 --> 01:24:03.360]  And where are the Christian conservative leaders coming out of the woodwork criticizing this?
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:04.681]  Where is George Bush?
[01:24:05.121 --> 01:24:06.082]  Nowhere, people!
[01:24:06.942 --> 01:24:10.625]  Going back to Michael Markavage of Repent America.
[01:24:11.986 --> 01:24:19.930]  Michael, so continuing with now the process and some of the other things the judge and the prosecution are up to.
[01:24:21.371 --> 01:24:26.795]  Well, when we initially were arrested and taken to jail, we had no idea what we were being charged with.
[01:24:26.855 --> 01:24:27.195]  In fact,
[01:24:27.679 --> 01:24:34.825]  We were told by someone in the jail that they were just charging us with disorderly conduct and some other charges.
[01:24:34.845 --> 01:24:44.172]  In fact, I had one man in the prison take me out of the cell up to an office, and in the office he looked at this and he said he could not believe it.
[01:24:44.633 --> 01:24:45.834]  It's terrible what happened.
[01:24:46.534 --> 01:24:49.897]  And he was the one who was an investigator assigned to the case.
[01:24:50.501 --> 01:24:53.002]  And he said he's ashamed to even have his signature on this.
[01:24:53.062 --> 01:24:56.644]  And he actually encouraged that we would actually win this in the end.
[01:24:56.864 --> 01:24:59.325]  Well, can't you call that officer as a witness?
[01:25:00.406 --> 01:25:01.326]  That's a good question.
[01:25:01.346 --> 01:25:04.427]  That was something that I'd have to ask the attorney to see what the strategy is.
[01:25:04.467 --> 01:25:05.128]  No, you can.
[01:25:05.168 --> 01:25:10.230]  You've got arresting officers or officers, over-arresting officers, saying they thought it was fraudulent.
[01:25:11.178 --> 01:25:17.202]  Well, we're going to have to do something because 47 years in jail is not something I'd feel up to right now.
[01:25:17.222 --> 01:25:23.486]  Have you heard the stories of people that read the Bible in their three-minute speech at city councils and are arrested?
[01:25:24.147 --> 01:25:24.507]  Oh, yes.
[01:25:24.927 --> 01:25:26.228]  I mean, this is happening all over.
[01:25:27.049 --> 01:25:27.329]  Oh, yes.
[01:25:28.210 --> 01:25:28.870]  It's dangerous.
[01:25:28.970 --> 01:25:33.213]  And this whole idea of hate crime, I don't know of a love crime.
[01:25:33.649 --> 01:25:39.592]  You know, as you were mentioning earlier, you know, it doesn't matter if it's a black man shooting a white man or a white man shooting a black man.
[01:25:39.612 --> 01:25:42.994]  There's no love in any of that, nor is there in any of these other things.
[01:25:43.034 --> 01:25:48.317]  So these hate laws are absolutely outrageous, and it's coming to America.
[01:25:49.798 --> 01:25:50.798]  And here's the caveat.
[01:25:51.119 --> 01:25:58.843]  We always told people this is what it was for because the social engineers said they were going to do this with these laws, and now they're doing it.
[01:25:58.863 --> 01:26:00.844]  That's right.
[01:26:02.829 --> 01:26:06.492]  So the worst case scenarios are now being used.
[01:26:08.373 --> 01:26:08.913]  Yes, it is.
[01:26:09.053 --> 01:26:21.301]  And what's remarkable about this is that the office, the prosecution in Philadelphia, Lynn Abraham's office, who's ordering our aggressive prosecution, is fully behind this.
[01:26:21.762 --> 01:26:28.066]  She could at any point obviously decide not to further this anymore, but she has decided...
[01:26:28.587 --> 01:26:31.129]  To prosecute us to the fullest extent of the law.
[01:26:31.509 --> 01:26:32.629]  And to set a precedent?
[01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:34.070]  Absolutely.
[01:26:34.911 --> 01:26:35.431]  Absolutely.
[01:26:35.491 --> 01:26:39.153]  Have you had any of the big establishment Christian groups come to your aid?
[01:26:40.574 --> 01:26:45.317]  We have not had anything other than some news stories that have been done.
[01:26:47.478 --> 01:26:56.584]  Dr. Dobson did in the Family News and Focus one of the news stories, and then Dr. Kennedy in Reclaiming America did a story on this, but
[01:26:57.057 --> 01:27:01.139]  Other than that, there hasn't been much of anything else said.
[01:27:01.939 --> 01:27:10.823]  I don't know what the reason is, but we hopefully can see whether just us going to a trial may awake some people.
[01:27:10.883 --> 01:27:13.725]  Probably not, but hopefully something's going to happen.
[01:27:14.205 --> 01:27:22.028]  Well, imagine yourself and ten others going into prison for decades, and when people say, why are you here?
[01:27:22.089 --> 01:27:24.029]  Well, I went to a protest and stood there.
[01:27:25.010 --> 01:27:25.210]  Right.
[01:27:26.457 --> 01:27:30.778]  I mean, look, I see articles like this every week out of Communist China.
[01:27:34.439 --> 01:27:35.839]  I mean, this isn't America.
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:41.601]  The initial reason he said that he had arrested us was for safety.
[01:27:43.161 --> 01:27:54.764]  And the Chief Inspector James Piano of Civil Affairs in Philadelphia had nothing according to his testimony that he's not the one that actually charged us with these things.
[01:27:54.784 --> 01:27:55.984]  It was the DA's office.
[01:27:56.482 --> 01:27:57.463]  Well, let me tell you something.
[01:27:58.623 --> 01:28:14.034]  I've interviewed Army veterans who, you know, one guy's a doctor, who complained too much to the VA, and Homeland Security was in the Quad City Times in Iowa saying, he threatened no one, but complaining too much is illegal, and so they've charged him, and he's facing prison.
[01:28:15.234 --> 01:28:15.755]  Remarkable.
[01:28:17.056 --> 01:28:18.196]  It's the new freedom, sir.
[01:28:18.717 --> 01:28:20.918]  Will you stay with us and come back and take some calls?
[01:28:21.659 --> 01:28:22.019]  Absolutely.
[01:28:22.739 --> 01:28:25.201]  Okay, you want to talk to Michael Markavage?
[01:28:26.201 --> 01:28:30.603]  Political prisoner, political dissident, thought criminal extraordinaire, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:30.783 --> 01:28:36.246]  They're going to use this across the board.
[01:28:36.826 --> 01:28:38.607]  On environmentalist activists, you name it.
[01:28:39.027 --> 01:28:39.507]  We'll be back.
[01:28:43.569 --> 01:28:44.489]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.949 --> 01:28:46.570]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.590 --> 01:28:50.152]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.224 --> 01:28:58.848]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glass, who is a pharmacist from Marks Plaza Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[01:28:58.968 --> 01:29:00.209]  Hi, Alan, welcome to the program.
[01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:00.950]  Thank you, Marvin.
[01:29:01.150 --> 01:29:04.513]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[01:29:04.673 --> 01:29:05.194]  Is that true?
[01:29:05.434 --> 01:29:06.415]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[01:29:06.455 --> 01:29:09.418]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[01:29:09.478 --> 01:29:09.738]  prices.
[01:29:09.938 --> 01:29:12.000]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:12.801]  They're very common.
[01:29:12.881 --> 01:29:16.064]  Those common drugs you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[01:29:16.104 --> 01:29:16.365]  price.
[01:29:16.625 --> 01:29:17.786]  Now what about Tamoxifen?
[01:29:17.806 --> 01:29:20.228]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[01:29:20.449 --> 01:29:24.252]  Tamoxifen, you can see a 75% savings against the regular U.S.
[01:29:24.272 --> 01:29:24.553]  price.
[01:29:24.913 --> 01:29:27.316]  Now are these brand name products made by the same companies?
[01:29:27.576 --> 01:29:29.578]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[01:29:29.618 --> 01:29:31.640]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.
[01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:36.826]  So to save money on prescription drugs in Canada, call the toll-free number for your information package.

[01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:11.237]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:30:11.677 --> 01:30:18.402]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:30:18.802 --> 01:30:30.591]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:30:31.071 --> 01:30:35.515]  The Berkey Lights rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:30:53.004 --> 01:30:55.487]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I've got a gripe.
[01:30:55.867 --> 01:30:58.810]  Recently, construction in my area has doubled my commute time.
[01:30:58.950 --> 01:31:02.614]  I'm spending up to four hours in stop-and-go rush hour traffic every day.
[01:31:02.794 --> 01:31:05.237]  The worst part is there's no good talk radio to listen to.
[01:31:05.397 --> 01:31:08.640]  But that doesn't matter to me anymore, thanks to the good people at Freeway Radio.
[01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:16.188]  I've got the Sony shortwave car stereo from Freeway Radio, and now I look forward to getting comfortable in my car and hearing the real scoop on the day's news.
[01:31:16.388 --> 01:31:18.070]  It's not just a shortwave radio, though.

[01:31:35.708 --> 01:31:36.349]  We're good to go.
[01:32:05.646 --> 01:32:06.826]  I have a video.
[01:32:09.027 --> 01:32:10.807]  I have aired this video locally in Austin.
[01:32:11.647 --> 01:32:19.729]  Good old George Woolley gave it to me years ago, and it's a documentary predominantly about how the ACLU will not help Christians when their rights are violated.
[01:32:20.829 --> 01:32:32.852]  And it shows people having their arms broken by nunchucks, by police, not getting up off the sidewalk, women with babies in their arms being sprayed with mace, just brutal stuff.
[01:32:35.281 --> 01:32:39.143]  And now that's happening to anti-war activists and to others.
[01:32:39.263 --> 01:32:40.944]  I mean, it's just all across the board.
[01:32:41.504 --> 01:32:42.725]  Our rights are being violated.
[01:32:44.506 --> 01:32:53.010]  And imagine being part of Repent America going out and protesting on the street corner.
[01:32:53.050 --> 01:32:57.432]  I mean, I can't tell you how many times I've gone out and protested groups I don't agree with.
[01:32:59.293 --> 01:33:00.694]  I've gone out and bullhorned them.
[01:33:01.218 --> 01:33:05.281]  The Million Mom March and environmental groups that are grabbing people's land.
[01:33:05.341 --> 01:33:10.104]  I protested Governor Bush for his policies.
[01:33:10.844 --> 01:33:18.369]  Imagine being arrested, and not just being arrested for disorderly conduct, that's the oldest trick in the book, for doing nothing, but being charged with felonies.
[01:33:19.984 --> 01:33:27.047]  Even when you have videotaped that you did nothing wrong, and the police is saying, well, the prosecutor is saying, well, you could have incited something.
[01:33:27.087 --> 01:33:28.188]  What you were saying was bad.
[01:33:28.428 --> 01:33:31.049]  The word repent is fighting words.
[01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:37.932]  So I guess if I go out to a demonstration and bullhorn, what you're doing is wrong!
[01:33:40.433 --> 01:33:45.895]  Regardless of what issue it is, I guess if it could cause somebody to be violent in someone's mind...
[01:33:46.832 --> 01:33:47.792]  Nothing even happens.
[01:33:47.833 --> 01:33:50.194]  You're preemptively taken to jail.
[01:33:52.435 --> 01:33:55.316]  We're about to go to calls for Michael Markavich.
[01:33:55.576 --> 01:33:57.157]  Michael, tell folks about your website.
[01:33:58.177 --> 01:34:14.965]  Well, we have on our website the video concerning this particular situation and the website's www.repentamerica.com www.repentamerica.com and we would encourage people to take a look at this video and you tell us if you see any
[01:34:15.727 --> 01:34:27.821]  Crime of criminal conspiracy, possessions of instrument of crime, reckless endangerment of another person, ethnic intimidation, riot, failure to disperse, disorderly conduct, obstructing a highway.
[01:34:28.582 --> 01:34:29.883]  This is what we were charged with.
[01:34:30.424 --> 01:34:31.545]  This is what we faced 47 years...
[01:34:33.044 --> 01:34:36.425]  In jail for doing nothing more than exercising a First Amendment.
[01:34:36.865 --> 01:34:49.089]  And the police, when they tell you, go to that designated area, go to this designated area, then they load you in a paddy wagon and say, oh, it's disorderly conduct, and then you get to jail and they start just slapping every charge in the book on you.
[01:34:49.921 --> 01:34:52.423]  Well, they're just hoping that something's going to stick, probably.
[01:34:52.783 --> 01:34:59.609]  By the way, I had an American Spectator rider on, far from liberal, who was arrested at the RNC, and I was there.
[01:34:59.729 --> 01:35:05.314]  I saw the protest that he was in that was being a mass arrest.
[01:35:05.394 --> 01:35:10.999]  I was smart enough to stand back a few hundred yards and later learn that he had been in the protest that I videotaped.
[01:35:11.739 --> 01:35:16.183]  And you have an authorized, permanent protest at Ground Zero, across the street,
[01:35:16.849 --> 01:35:24.077]  And the police just surrounded it and arrested about 200 of the several thousand people that were there, one of them an American Spectator writer.
[01:35:25.078 --> 01:35:32.066]  And then the police, a cop he'd never even seen who admitted he wasn't even there, filled out the arrest form while he was in jail...
[01:35:33.471 --> 01:35:35.833]  Alex, let me say this.
[01:35:35.853 --> 01:35:40.557]  This may not be surprising to you, but I was at the RNC across the street with a sign and was arrested and spent 32 hours in jail.
[01:36:03.436 --> 01:36:10.620]  And my charges were just dismissed because the prosecution in New York didn't have the time to move forward with the case.
[01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:18.703]  Okay, well, let's go over that, because I was there from Saturday to Friday for the entire event, and I was threatened three times today on average.
[01:36:18.723 --> 01:36:21.785]  We've actually counted it up, and it's in the new film that I'm making.
[01:36:22.815 --> 01:36:23.756]  And they would run over.
[01:36:23.796 --> 01:36:24.416]  I mean, it didn't matter.
[01:36:24.456 --> 01:36:26.617]  I was in a city park interviewing a little old lady.
[01:36:26.957 --> 01:36:31.039]  Police would run over, start screaming, cussing, threatening to arrest us.
[01:36:31.859 --> 01:36:46.126]  And the reason I mentioned the American Spectator was it was AP reporters, liberals, conservatives, 12-year-old children coming home from summer school, just German tourists.
[01:36:46.546 --> 01:36:48.567]  It was just random craziness.
[01:36:48.887 --> 01:36:49.888]  You were in New York.
[01:36:49.928 --> 01:36:50.568]  What happened to you?
[01:36:51.425 --> 01:36:55.306]  Well, I was across the street from Madison Square Garden with one other person.
[01:36:55.346 --> 01:36:56.346]  There was no one else there.
[01:36:56.846 --> 01:37:01.928]  We were on a public sidewalk that people were walking hundreds upon hundreds up and down the sidewalk.
[01:37:01.948 --> 01:37:04.388]  Yeah, the whole area was blocked off around MSG.
[01:37:05.209 --> 01:37:05.469]  Right.
[01:37:06.069 --> 01:37:12.210]  Well, at one point, the sidewalk on the Pennsylvania Hotel side was open, and there was free traffic there.
[01:37:12.791 --> 01:37:14.951]  Not traffic where, you know, cars were going.
[01:37:14.971 --> 01:37:15.831]  Pedestrian traffic, yeah.
[01:37:16.011 --> 01:37:17.052]  Pedestrian traffic.
[01:37:17.112 --> 01:37:18.432]  And we stood there with our sign.
[01:37:18.948 --> 01:37:20.669]  And they came over and said, you can't do this.
[01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:23.952]  And I asked what law we're violating, and they told us to move down.
[01:37:23.992 --> 01:37:29.657]  We moved down to the corner, and I said, okay, we'll go where you say, but what law is this we're violating?
[01:37:30.317 --> 01:37:31.618]  And they said, okay, you're under arrest.
[01:37:31.999 --> 01:37:37.223]  So I noticed that just for even, by the way, I noticed that if you looked them in the eye,
[01:37:37.856 --> 01:37:38.897]  The screaming would begin.
[01:37:38.937 --> 01:37:56.327]  I mean, even, it's like China, or Russia, just show, it's like Arnold said in his speech, we were afraid to look them in the eyes in Austria, but America isn't that way, and right outside while he's giving his speech, that very thing is happening, man, I tell you, and so, they said, that's it, you're arrested.
[01:37:57.187 --> 01:37:58.968]  Exactly, and... Where did they take you?
[01:37:59.629 --> 01:38:03.051]  They took us to the, bound by the Hudson...
[01:38:04.149 --> 01:38:04.950]  Oh, you were in Pier 57.
[01:38:05.110 --> 01:38:06.231]  Tell us about it.
[01:38:07.312 --> 01:38:08.813]  I was outside videotaping.
[01:38:10.194 --> 01:38:11.836]  Well, too bad you couldn't join us, Alex.
[01:38:12.576 --> 01:38:15.318]  We were in there, and it was amazing.
[01:38:15.338 --> 01:38:18.401]  They had these cages that were set up well in advance.
[01:38:18.541 --> 01:38:23.285]  Cages that were, you know, just, you know, hundreds and hundreds of people.
[01:38:23.305 --> 01:38:24.966]  Yeah, we have photos of it.
[01:38:24.986 --> 01:38:31.211]  20-foot tall cyclone fences with barbed wire on top with a port-a-potty there right in the middle.
[01:38:31.972 --> 01:38:32.132]  Yes.
[01:38:33.095 --> 01:38:33.996]  But I'll shut up.
[01:38:34.056 --> 01:38:34.957]  You were actually in there.
[01:38:34.977 --> 01:38:35.717]  Tell us all about it.
[01:38:36.338 --> 01:38:39.200]  Well, when I was in this thing, I couldn't believe it.
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:45.064]  I'm looking around, and it looked like, I mean, I'd never been in a concentration camp, but it sure looked close enough.
[01:38:45.625 --> 01:38:54.512]  And there was a lot of, obviously, people who were there were sick from fumes that were still left over.
[01:38:54.812 --> 01:38:55.112]  That's right.
[01:38:55.132 --> 01:38:57.994]  They would also run the buses in there while you were in there.
[01:38:58.595 --> 01:38:58.855]  Oh, yeah.
[01:38:58.895 --> 01:39:00.316]  They'd run the buses in.
[01:39:00.977 --> 01:39:01.817]  They'd transport us.
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:11.862]  When we were transported out of that facility, we were in this bus, I don't know how long, waiting maybe about an hour before the bus ever took off.
[01:39:11.882 --> 01:39:12.463]  It was hot.
[01:39:13.823 --> 01:39:18.884]  I couldn't believe this was happening, and clearly they were just casting nets over anyone.
[01:39:18.964 --> 01:39:25.146]  And I was handcuffed to militant homosexuals, to anti-war protesters, to all kinds.
[01:39:25.206 --> 01:39:31.888]  And we were all there, and we could at least agree on one thing, and that is it was absolutely outrageous what the city of New York was doing.
[01:39:33.307 --> 01:39:38.633]  Well, the American Spectator writer was assaulted by these lunatics.
[01:39:38.993 --> 01:39:43.118]  So, now again, then we interviewed people who would go, I don't know what was wrong.
[01:39:43.498 --> 01:39:48.423]  I'd throw something at the cops and they'd come by and tell me I could go free and then they'd arrest all these innocent people.
[01:39:48.484 --> 01:39:49.785]  Duh, I don't get it.
[01:39:50.105 --> 01:39:52.308]  They were told to just go after everybody.
[01:39:53.152 --> 01:39:55.294]  And, again, folks, imagine.
[01:39:55.394 --> 01:39:56.976]  I mean, I'd be at Central Park.
[01:39:57.056 --> 01:39:59.558]  I'd be in a little park in Wall Street.
[01:39:59.639 --> 01:40:03.102]  I'd be anywhere doing an interview, and they'd run over and start screaming.
[01:40:03.142 --> 01:40:06.785]  And I had congressional press passes to the floor.
[01:40:06.886 --> 01:40:14.493]  I mean, I could walk up to within 15 feet of George Bush if I wanted to, but it didn't matter if I had the most...
[01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:17.050]  Powerful press passes you could have.
[01:40:17.451 --> 01:40:18.191]  It did not matter.
[01:40:18.211 --> 01:40:20.631]  And I was dressed conservatively.
[01:40:20.671 --> 01:40:21.712]  I looked very conservative.
[01:40:22.392 --> 01:40:26.313]  And so my point is, it was just everybody was under attack by this.
[01:40:27.693 --> 01:40:30.414]  There were people coming out of restaurants who were arrested.
[01:40:30.774 --> 01:40:31.254]  No, I know.
[01:40:31.654 --> 01:40:32.174]  I saw that.
[01:40:32.194 --> 01:40:38.896]  And people just... Elderly women were in this concentration camp down on the Hudson.
[01:40:39.816 --> 01:40:41.016]  I couldn't believe what I saw.
[01:40:41.036 --> 01:40:42.737]  It was something to witness.
[01:40:42.837 --> 01:40:44.097]  Okay, so...
[01:40:45.509 --> 01:40:51.430]  October, you're getting charged with all these thought crimes in Philadelphia.
[01:40:52.090 --> 01:41:02.992]  And then now in September, you're getting arrested by Madison Square Garden in amongst giant protests for having a... What does your sign say?
[01:41:03.192 --> 01:41:05.133]  We had a pro-life witness there.
[01:41:05.653 --> 01:41:13.094]  There was a pro-life witness to the convention and to the people that were... You can't have a pro-life sign at an RNC, buddy.
[01:41:14.194 --> 01:41:15.395]  Well, not these days.
[01:41:16.476 --> 01:41:18.578]  Man, this is out of control!
[01:41:20.139 --> 01:41:22.060]  See what a small world it is, folks?
[01:41:24.562 --> 01:41:26.223]  Anything else people should know about the camp?
[01:41:27.484 --> 01:41:34.029]  Well, I was in this one cell, in this cage, if you will, for hours and hours, so that's the most I saw of it.
[01:41:34.069 --> 01:41:42.195]  But I know there were people in a section of this that ended up being ill because of oil on the floor and they were all dirty and
[01:41:42.617 --> 01:41:54.182]  I had to spend some time in central booking with these individuals, and I couldn't believe some of the things they were saying about the cage they were in, which was down at the end of the hallway.
[01:41:55.583 --> 01:41:59.465]  But be that as it may, I will never forget that experience.
[01:42:01.027 --> 01:42:02.328]  Well, I talked to everybody.
[01:42:02.408 --> 01:42:05.089]  I mean, just probably 50 people that were inside there.
[01:42:05.109 --> 01:42:07.670]  And they said they'd drive a bus in and just park it and run it.
[01:42:08.190 --> 01:42:09.411]  And everybody was getting sick.
[01:42:09.471 --> 01:42:11.171]  And there was oil all over the floor.
[01:42:11.211 --> 01:42:14.233]  And people would come out with just oil and huge rashes all over them.
[01:42:14.553 --> 01:42:16.513]  And then I'd be across the street videotaping.
[01:42:17.214 --> 01:42:19.475]  And police with big TV camera.
[01:42:19.815 --> 01:42:23.616]  And they'd just run over and start screaming, I'm talking here, Mac!
[01:42:23.696 --> 01:42:25.117]  Don't you interrupt me!
[01:42:25.717 --> 01:42:27.118]  And I'd be like, well...
[01:42:28.852 --> 01:42:29.473]  Well, it was so bad.
[01:42:55.428 --> 01:43:03.190]  At the RNC, that was probably one of the worst examples I saw of them clamping down on peaceful protesters.
[01:43:03.210 --> 01:43:12.032]  Well, it's almost like back at the headquarters, like the head cop gets up and goes, crush them, drive them into submission, let them know we rule them.
[01:43:12.252 --> 01:43:16.113]  I mean, we didn't see them say that, but that's how the police were behaving.
[01:43:17.033 --> 01:43:17.333]  Oh, yeah.
[01:43:17.353 --> 01:43:19.354]  So we have audio tape, too, of this.
[01:43:19.818 --> 01:43:26.399]  I had a tape recorder, and I said, okay, officer, we're going to go where you say, but tell me what law I'd be violating if we stay here.
[01:43:26.499 --> 01:43:27.140]  That's all I want.
[01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:31.320]  And I said, and that was it, and then we were under arrest.
[01:43:32.401 --> 01:43:41.283]  So it was unexpected, but I'll tell you, it's some of the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in the sense of them dealing with people who are peaceful.
[01:43:42.043 --> 01:43:47.664]  Even the anti-war people, I mean, they're probably people that got out of control, but at the same time, they knew in advance.
[01:43:48.211 --> 01:43:54.133]  They had that concentration camp down on the Hudson already prepared well in advance.
[01:43:54.213 --> 01:43:58.575]  By the way, as you know, here in Austin, Texas, they set one of these up in 99.
[01:43:58.715 --> 01:44:00.316]  It's still just sitting there.
[01:44:00.716 --> 01:44:03.837]  Same bar-bar fences inside, porta-potties, all of it.
[01:44:05.978 --> 01:44:07.079]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[01:44:07.119 --> 01:44:10.100]  Every major city has at least one or two of these facilities for your freedom.
[01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:11.480]  Let's take some calls.
[01:44:12.201 --> 01:44:17.063]  Again, you're going to be talking to a man, Michael Markavage, facing 47 years in prison.
[01:44:18.802 --> 01:44:21.424]  For peacefully protesting all part of the new freedom.
[01:44:21.745 --> 01:44:23.346]  Paul in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[01:44:23.406 --> 01:44:23.826]  Go ahead.
[01:44:24.046 --> 01:44:25.467]  Well, hello there, Alex.
[01:44:26.808 --> 01:44:26.908]  Hello.
[01:44:26.928 --> 01:44:28.069]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:44:28.209 --> 01:44:28.590]  Thank you.
[01:44:30.411 --> 01:44:33.273]  I don't know if I can speak relevant to your guest right now.
[01:44:34.134 --> 01:44:36.856]  I've been keeping notes since we started today.
[01:44:36.876 --> 01:44:38.117]  Well, that's okay, sir.
[01:44:38.137 --> 01:44:38.877]  You're on the air now.
[01:44:38.917 --> 01:44:39.618]  What's on your mind?
[01:44:39.918 --> 01:44:40.319]  Okay.
[01:44:40.939 --> 01:44:41.760]  Left and right.
[01:44:43.121 --> 01:44:46.083]  These are two wings of the same dirty bird.
[01:44:47.307 --> 01:44:48.508]  They're both proletarian.
[01:44:49.349 --> 01:44:50.089]  They're both evil.
[01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:51.771]  We shouldn't support either one of them.
[01:44:52.951 --> 01:44:56.114]  If they tell you rain is wet, I wouldn't believe them.
[01:44:57.875 --> 01:45:02.359]  And that's what I have to say about left and right.
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:10.465]  Also, I listened to you on a FM, micro FM here in Tennessee.
[01:45:12.146 --> 01:45:15.209]  And the owner of the station
[01:45:16.479 --> 01:45:16.799]  I think so.
[01:45:16.819 --> 01:45:17.060]  I think so.
[01:45:42.247 --> 01:45:48.128]  Some of the things that were in that file was that he was a resident of the Bahamas.
[01:45:48.489 --> 01:45:56.350]  I mean, he had a business in the Bahamas, that he was a major drug dealer dealing $10 million worth of drugs per year.
[01:45:58.291 --> 01:46:01.432]  It's totally ridiculous, but I... No, those are...
[01:46:03.641 --> 01:46:05.302]  That's what I normally call it.
[01:46:05.342 --> 01:46:08.963]  Yeah, well I don't like to call it that because that's not what it is.
[01:46:08.983 --> 01:46:10.084]  The old term pirate comes from somebody with a...
[01:46:26.810 --> 01:46:28.091]  Well, that's interesting, Paul.
[01:46:28.111 --> 01:46:28.751]  Thanks for the call.
[01:46:28.771 --> 01:46:30.992]  We've seen stuff like this before.
[01:46:57.799 --> 01:47:03.825]  In fact, we've gone for, say, a pro-gun rally or pro-property right rally.
[01:47:03.845 --> 01:47:06.828]  You'll hear the cops on the radios going, yeah.
[01:47:07.515 --> 01:47:10.657]  That's the leader, Alex Jones, leader of the Republic of Texas terror group.
[01:47:11.017 --> 01:47:12.117]  This is like five years ago.
[01:47:12.137 --> 01:47:13.878]  Well, I'm not in the Republic of Texas.
[01:47:14.278 --> 01:47:16.019]  No members of the Republic of Texas were there.
[01:47:16.039 --> 01:47:18.681]  The Republic of Texas isn't a terror group, by the way.
[01:47:19.401 --> 01:47:22.142]  But the point is, it's just to demonize a group of pro-gun.
[01:47:22.763 --> 01:47:25.024]  Well, that one was a pro-land rights group.
[01:47:25.364 --> 01:47:29.606]  It's to marginalize somebody's reading off a file at headquarters.
[01:47:30.166 --> 01:47:32.667]  And you hear the cops being told this stuff that isn't true.
[01:47:33.327 --> 01:47:36.049]  And a lot of this demonization goes on.
[01:47:36.249 --> 01:47:38.470]  Any comments to what he was just saying, Michael?
[01:47:39.210 --> 01:47:50.915]  Well, what's interesting is with the FBI and the files they keep, I came back from the DNC convention in Boston, and I was greeted with a card from the FBI through my door.
[01:47:51.015 --> 01:47:51.915]  They wanted to meet with me.
[01:47:52.055 --> 01:47:52.916]  They wanted to talk to me.
[01:47:52.956 --> 01:47:54.436]  They wanted to know what I'm up to.
[01:47:54.456 --> 01:47:56.137]  So I called them and
[01:47:56.858 --> 01:47:59.959]  And my attorney talked to him and said, you know, I'm not going to meet with them.
[01:48:01.239 --> 01:48:03.020]  We've got activist Christians.
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:04.681]  We've got to go talk to them.
[01:48:06.541 --> 01:48:09.422]  It's remarkable in the sense that, you know, here I am.
[01:48:10.142 --> 01:48:11.783]  Everything I do is pretty much in the open.
[01:48:11.843 --> 01:48:16.444]  I mean, it's not like anything that's not on my website you're not going to find out.
[01:48:17.285 --> 01:48:21.626]  And here they come to our homes and want to meet with us.
[01:48:21.886 --> 01:48:24.407]  So I don't exactly know all the details of
[01:48:25.256 --> 01:48:25.556]  Yes, hi.
[01:48:54.188 --> 01:48:55.268]  Mr. Markovich?
[01:48:58.049 --> 01:49:01.589]  Do you have the name of the judge and what court you're in?
[01:49:02.730 --> 01:49:03.030]  Sure.
[01:49:03.230 --> 01:49:06.130]  It was the Philadelphia Municipal Court.
[01:49:06.710 --> 01:49:14.212]  And the judge's name is Judge William Austin Meehan.
[01:49:14.732 --> 01:49:16.632]  M-E-E-H-A-N.
[01:49:17.872 --> 01:49:18.692]  M as in Mary?
[01:49:19.332 --> 01:49:19.572]  Yes.
[01:49:19.752 --> 01:49:20.493]  M as in Mary.
[01:49:20.733 --> 01:49:22.193]  E-E-H-A-N.
[01:49:24.071 --> 01:49:25.692]  How about the prosecutor?
[01:49:26.552 --> 01:49:29.572]  That was Charles Ehrlich.
[01:49:29.872 --> 01:49:31.393]  And I don't know how to spell his last name.
[01:49:31.453 --> 01:49:32.093]  Charles Ehrlich.
[01:49:32.113 --> 01:49:35.934]  He's the chief of that unit.
[01:49:36.514 --> 01:49:36.794]  Okay.
[01:49:36.814 --> 01:49:38.254]  Can I hold on, Alex?
[01:49:38.554 --> 01:49:38.934]  Yes.
[01:49:39.314 --> 01:49:42.435]  We'll talk about the Earl of Canterbury, Ehrlich, when we get back.
[01:49:43.795 --> 01:49:44.436]  Stay with us.
[01:49:44.976 --> 01:49:46.416]  This guest is just amazing.
[01:49:48.114 --> 01:49:49.215]  We're good to go.
[01:50:08.986 --> 01:50:09.947]  Pan Amers.

[01:50:23.678 --> 01:50:34.087]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.

[01:52:02.405 --> 01:52:08.753]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500 parts per million, Olive Leaf Extract,
[01:52:09.073 --> 01:52:09.734]  We're good to go.
[01:52:24.628 --> 01:52:24.988]  We're good to go.
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:12.246]  All right, we're going to keep our guest, Michael Markavich, into the next hour, about 30 minutes.
[01:53:12.266 --> 01:53:23.218]  We appreciate him doing that so we can talk to Jim and Ken and Kevin and Ron and everybody else that's patiently holding on this December 20, 2004, Monday edition.
[01:53:23.599 --> 01:53:27.203]  Before we go back to Michael and others, other thought criminals,
[01:53:29.218 --> 01:53:31.199]  Folks, the globalists are losing control.
[01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:33.581]  That's why they're trying to squeeze so tight right now.
[01:53:33.621 --> 01:53:41.027]  That's why they're panicking, trying to restrict free speech across the board, regardless of what group you're affiliated with.
[01:53:41.747 --> 01:53:44.509]  But it's particularly bad against real Christian conservatives.
[01:53:44.869 --> 01:53:49.032]  That's the most persecuted group out there, clearly, from the track record I've seen.
[01:53:50.273 --> 01:53:52.575]  But it's expanding out for everyone to enjoy it as well.
[01:53:53.217 --> 01:54:03.723]  In fact, in Police State 3 Total Enslavement, I have the mainstream news articles and video clips where people that sue government officials for taking their land are arrested, charged, and convicted as terrorists.
[01:54:04.423 --> 01:54:06.984]  That's like two minutes of that two-hour, 44-minute film.
[01:54:08.745 --> 01:54:10.246]  My videos are so jam-packed.
[01:54:10.286 --> 01:54:11.667]  I mean, take Road to Tyranny.
[01:54:12.107 --> 01:54:14.608]  Three and a half minutes of that two-and-a-half-hour film.
[01:54:15.549 --> 01:54:17.130]  Oh, the DVD's almost three hours.
[01:54:17.150 --> 01:54:19.771]  A few minutes shy of three hours.
[01:54:20.598 --> 01:54:28.680]  Three or four minutes of that is FEMA in Kansas City saying all Christians are terrorists, the Founding Fathers are terrorists, Christians are enemies of the federal government.
[01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:35.862]  Then we have their training manuals and their documents where they're teaching police this.
[01:54:35.882 --> 01:54:45.684]  Then we show police from their own squad car video cameras repeating the things from the manuals as they arrest unarmed women with no criminal record for their political affiliation.
[01:54:45.704 --> 01:54:50.005]  I mean, we show you the brainwashing and then we show it to you in function.
[01:54:50.498 --> 01:54:57.367]  But just that little three minute clips of the FEMA guy and then it's about 15 minutes we spend on the whole thing total out of the entire film.
[01:54:58.569 --> 01:55:00.271]  Just to give you an idea of what's in these videos.
[01:55:00.551 --> 01:55:03.876]  You can watch all 11 of my films and a bunch of other...
[01:55:04.477 --> 01:55:05.158]  We're good to go.
[01:55:32.643 --> 01:55:35.285]  Also, you can call toll-free to get any of my films.
[01:55:35.405 --> 01:55:41.431]  We've got discounts of DVDs and videos as low as $5.95 apiece.

[01:56:02.048 --> 01:56:02.929]  888-253-3139.
[01:56:03.249 --> 01:56:04.190]  Get my videos.
[01:56:04.270 --> 01:56:05.191]  Make copies of them.
[01:56:05.471 --> 01:56:06.412]  Get them out to people.
[01:56:06.452 --> 01:56:07.713]  They're unlocking minds.
[01:56:09.154 --> 01:56:11.196]  All right, going back to Mike in Arizona.
[01:56:11.236 --> 01:56:14.138]  Mike's got about a minute and a half with our guests before this hour ends.
[01:56:15.379 --> 01:56:16.900]  Yes, Mr. Markovich.
[01:56:16.941 --> 01:56:20.063]  Has your attorney discussed the possibility of...
[01:56:21.784 --> 01:56:23.444]  That's a good question.
[01:56:23.464 --> 01:56:28.665]  Right now, we're specifically dealing with the criminal aspect until we then, after that's done with, if we don't get convicted,
[01:56:50.340 --> 01:56:55.103]  We can file a federal suit and then possibly deal with what you just mentioned.
[01:56:55.123 --> 01:56:56.504]  Well, let me bring something up here.
[01:56:56.524 --> 01:57:11.834]  You may be able to trade some blood for justice here by getting these people into civil court, getting them served notice on them.
[01:57:11.894 --> 01:57:14.796]  This intimidation business works two ways.
[01:57:16.792 --> 01:57:24.096]  We need to start bringing these people into federal court and making them responsible for craziness like this.
[01:57:24.376 --> 01:57:26.397]  Mike, I wanted to get your comment on that.
[01:57:26.918 --> 01:57:37.483]  I mean, this is hard for me to believe that these cases are popping up all over the country where people admittedly don't do anything wrong, don't even threaten anybody, and they're being charged with felonies.
[01:57:37.884 --> 01:57:38.284]  Stay there.
[01:57:38.304 --> 01:57:39.605]  We'll get your comment on the other side.
[01:57:39.685 --> 01:57:40.465]  More calls as well.
[01:57:43.827 --> 01:57:44.027]  Hello.
[01:57:49.845 --> 01:57:50.485]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.146 --> 01:57:52.187]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.908 --> 01:57:54.049]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.669 --> 01:57:55.530]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.251 --> 01:57:57.132]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.152 --> 01:58:01.476]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.997 --> 01:58:06.161]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.502 --> 01:58:12.607]  We're taking your calls and talking to Michael Markovich of Repent America.
[01:58:14.756 --> 01:58:18.918]  He was arrested in New York City at the RNC for having a pro-life sign.
[01:58:22.239 --> 01:58:27.201]  He was at this Outfest in Philadelphia in October.
[01:58:28.982 --> 01:58:33.224]  And he and a bunch of others were put in a paddy wagon for peaceably standing there on the sidewalk.
[01:58:34.564 --> 01:58:39.566]  They're being charged with felonies saying, well, criticizing homosexuality is a hate crime.
[01:58:39.626 --> 01:58:40.547]  It hurts people's feelings.
[01:58:40.587 --> 01:58:41.487]  It incites violence.
[01:58:42.179 --> 01:58:46.700]  He's facing 47 years in prison, and they admit he didn't touch anybody, anything.
[01:58:47.281 --> 01:58:48.141]  This is the new freedom.
[01:58:48.201 --> 01:58:50.622]  No free speech, no First Amendment.
[01:58:51.182 --> 01:58:55.543]  And again, it's happening to people all over the country, all over the Western world.
[01:58:55.563 --> 01:59:00.184]  BBC News reporters are being arrested for saying the word homosexual.
[01:59:00.544 --> 01:59:02.505]  That's considered a hate word now in England.
[01:59:03.518 --> 01:59:12.084]  We have that BBC News article on PrisonPlanet.com and the audio archives along with the interview I did two years ago with a BBC reporter that it happened to.
[01:59:12.104 --> 01:59:13.205]  I mean, this is happening all over.
[01:59:14.706 --> 01:59:17.587]  We're talking to Mike in Arizona, then Jim, Ken, Kevin, and Ron and others.
[01:59:17.608 --> 01:59:18.368]  We'll get to you in a second.
[01:59:18.908 --> 01:59:21.530]  But, Mike, we hit that break.
[01:59:21.550 --> 01:59:25.793]  I wanted you to briefly... I mean, are you finding this hard to believe what's happening to Michael and others?
[01:59:26.173 --> 01:59:27.834]  I mean, it's happening so quick.
[01:59:27.874 --> 01:59:28.955]  They're really doing it now.
[01:59:29.713 --> 01:59:37.678]  Well, if it's any consolation to him, I don't think they're going to be too energetic in trying to get him convicted.
[01:59:37.718 --> 01:59:43.221]  I think, paradoxically, I think your show is actually serving their end.
[01:59:43.861 --> 01:59:47.203]  I think intimidation is what this is all about and trying to discourage people.
[01:59:48.618 --> 01:59:51.180]  You know, planting this thought in the back of their minds.
[01:59:51.320 --> 01:59:56.502]  No, certainly it's happening to the vast minority of people, but they're trying to set a precedent, Mike.
[01:59:56.763 --> 02:00:01.045]  We have to talk about it to expose it so people know what this government's trying to do.
[02:00:01.405 --> 02:00:08.268]  Yeah, but simply getting yourself off the criminal hook here is not enough.
[02:00:08.369 --> 02:00:09.309]  No, I agree.
[02:00:09.329 --> 02:00:11.830]  There needs to be civil rights lawsuits.
[02:00:12.211 --> 02:00:14.992]  Yeah, and you've already been injured.
[02:00:16.113 --> 02:00:16.873]  If nothing else, you can...
[02:00:17.421 --> 02:00:18.642]  False arrest.
[02:00:18.682 --> 02:00:20.643]  Yeah, false arrest, defamation.
[02:00:21.644 --> 02:00:28.869]  But you may need to get an attorney from outside the area who isn't afraid to debunk the local system and jeopardize his career.
[02:00:29.890 --> 02:00:38.396]  But we need to start doing some intimidating here and letting these people know that there are consequences to this kind of... Well, I would call it defending.
[02:00:40.097 --> 02:00:40.558]  Okay.
[02:00:40.618 --> 02:00:42.539]  And the best defense is a good offense.
[02:00:42.939 --> 02:00:43.480]  Absolutely.
[02:00:44.781 --> 02:00:53.403]  What I want to ask is have any of the local papers or radio stations, TV stations been receptive to you?
[02:00:53.503 --> 02:00:55.484]  Are they anxious to hear your story?
[02:00:56.384 --> 02:01:05.346]  No, in all reality this is something they just want to sweep under the carpet as if it never happened and just let the hate crime law go unchallenged in the public forum.
[02:01:05.885 --> 02:01:07.746]  So, you know, that's not what's expected.
[02:01:08.006 --> 02:01:14.450]  And to touch on something you had mentioned, that the prosecution may, well, they're not trying to get us convicted in this regard.
[02:01:14.790 --> 02:01:15.951]  They are!
[02:01:16.291 --> 02:01:20.714]  And this is the thing, is that we never thought we'd be charged with three felonies and five misdemeanors.
[02:01:20.734 --> 02:01:21.394]  That's unheard of.
[02:01:22.415 --> 02:01:32.221]  So for them to, you know, back down now, I think would be outrageous on their part, and they would face quite an hefty lawsuit, which they still will, regardless.
[02:01:32.281 --> 02:01:34.242]  Because there are six women that have been
[02:01:35.337 --> 02:01:42.263]  Taken out of the equation, their case has been dismissed in the criminal court, and we're looking forward to aggressively fighting that from a different angle.
[02:01:42.873 --> 02:01:46.155]  Okay, well, I hope you'll keep us posted, maybe through Alex.
[02:01:46.636 --> 02:01:49.718]  But, Mike, to be clear, Mike, we have to talk about this.
[02:01:49.838 --> 02:01:52.700]  I mean, it's good that we had Michael on as a guest.
[02:01:53.020 --> 02:01:54.581]  But we have to do more than talk about it, Alex.
[02:01:54.601 --> 02:02:00.525]  No, I know, but your statement that this actually aids the establishment, yeah, we're all a bunch of cowards.
[02:02:00.865 --> 02:02:04.848]  This is the time to stand up and talk about the wrongs that are being committed.
[02:02:05.208 --> 02:02:05.388]  Sure.
[02:02:05.909 --> 02:02:07.930]  I didn't mean to discourage you from doing this, Alex.
[02:02:07.970 --> 02:02:09.311]  I mean, we obviously need to know...
[02:02:10.203 --> 02:02:13.706]  You mean just be conscious of what this is all about is intimidation?
[02:02:14.267 --> 02:02:14.827]  Absolutely.
[02:02:15.868 --> 02:02:25.998]  But I hope you'll keep us posted, and if necessary, some of us would be willing to contribute to your legal defense and whatever legal action you choose to take here.
[02:02:26.418 --> 02:02:32.724]  Well, please visit our website there, and if you could send some information about what you know about Philadelphia and the RICO, I'd appreciate that as well.
[02:02:33.377 --> 02:02:33.837]  Absolutely.
[02:02:34.478 --> 02:02:36.219]  That website again, Mark?
[02:02:36.779 --> 02:02:38.380]  It's repentamerica.com.
[02:02:38.660 --> 02:02:39.321]  Michael, excuse me.
[02:02:39.341 --> 02:02:42.203]  All right, we'll be right back, and we'll take more calls.
[02:02:42.223 --> 02:02:43.183]  Everybody, stay with us.
[02:02:43.444 --> 02:02:43.844]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:45.436 --> 02:02:46.937]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:47.117 --> 02:02:50.200]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.340 --> 02:02:54.243]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.283 --> 02:02:58.507]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:02:58.867 --> 02:03:02.650]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:02.790 --> 02:03:04.592]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:04.892 --> 02:03:08.074]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[02:03:08.114 --> 02:03:12.838]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:12.998 --> 02:03:16.040]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:16.220 --> 02:03:19.082]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:19.562 --> 02:03:25.687]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:26.207 --> 02:03:30.011]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:03:30.411 --> 02:03:31.773]  Order your video today.

[02:04:37.048 --> 02:04:40.331]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[02:04:40.351 --> 02:04:40.451]  Why?
[02:04:40.671 --> 02:04:41.091]  Heaven people.
[02:04:49.497 --> 02:04:49.957]  We're good to go.
[02:05:12.745 --> 02:05:13.486]  We're good to go.

[02:05:34.579 --> 02:05:37.080]  Beat the odds and do your body right with Cardivite.
[02:05:53.027 --> 02:05:54.128]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.788 --> 02:05:55.629]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.389 --> 02:05:57.290]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.310 --> 02:06:01.753]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.113 --> 02:06:06.276]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.677 --> 02:06:08.557]  Welcome back.
[02:06:08.858 --> 02:06:10.038]  Into the third hour.
[02:06:10.098 --> 02:06:11.399]  Eight minutes, 30 seconds.
[02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:13.221]  Into the third hour.
[02:06:15.202 --> 02:06:18.164]  Talking to Michael Markavage of Repent America.
[02:06:20.464 --> 02:06:37.028]  Didn't touch anybody, didn't cuss at anybody, didn't do anything but go out and sing hymns on a street corner during a gay pride march and was arrested because what they were doing was an ethnic intimidation.
[02:06:37.068 --> 02:06:39.689]  You don't criticize people, that could intimidate them.
[02:06:39.729 --> 02:06:43.130]  We've got to put you in jail for 47 years and it doesn't matter.
[02:06:44.508 --> 02:06:52.010]  The professional, separate commercial TV cameras are there showing everything, covering them for a documentary.
[02:06:52.030 --> 02:06:54.050]  It doesn't matter if you have video or if you did nothing.
[02:06:54.410 --> 02:06:57.431]  The fact that you were there is just hateful.
[02:06:58.151 --> 02:06:58.751]  And it's wicked.
[02:07:00.391 --> 02:07:03.312]  And I think some people out there listening are still in denial about this.
[02:07:03.352 --> 02:07:04.132]  This is serious.
[02:07:04.152 --> 02:07:05.112]  They're prosecuting them.
[02:07:05.412 --> 02:07:06.352]  They're going after them.
[02:07:06.392 --> 02:07:07.893]  This is happening all over the country.
[02:07:09.313 --> 02:07:13.534]  I mean, just a few months ago, in a city council,
[02:07:15.416 --> 02:07:17.538]  On the East Coast, I read the article here on air.
[02:07:18.879 --> 02:07:32.050]  A man got up during his three-minute speech that you can give in Citizens Communication, read from the Bible, some passages that were critical of homosexuality, and the mayor ordered him arrested and said, that's hateful.
[02:07:32.851 --> 02:07:34.072]  You shouldn't be allowed to do that.
[02:07:35.693 --> 02:07:38.896]  Now, again, this is what the government thinks is normal.
[02:07:39.873 --> 02:07:46.776]  And whether you're a pro-life demonstrator or an anti-war activist or an environmental activist, it doesn't matter.
[02:07:46.856 --> 02:07:48.477]  They're doing this to people across the board.
[02:07:48.537 --> 02:07:53.899]  But the environmental activists, they just charge them with three or four misdemeanors and they've got to pay some big fines.
[02:07:54.200 --> 02:07:57.101]  With Christians, they're trying to put them under the jail.
[02:07:58.249 --> 02:07:59.550]  So this should concern everybody.
[02:07:59.950 --> 02:08:09.678]  Jim in Boston, Mass., the place where they like to kill young women with rubber bullets for no reason, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:08:09.698 --> 02:08:10.138]  Go ahead.
[02:08:10.678 --> 02:08:11.639]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:08:11.699 --> 02:08:12.960]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:13.380]  You bet.
[02:08:13.661 --> 02:08:17.223]  You know, it reminds me of two movies.
[02:08:18.164 --> 02:08:20.406]  There was one TV series that went back.
[02:08:20.946 --> 02:08:27.511]  It was in 1985 called America, which was on for like six nights in a row.
[02:08:28.274 --> 02:08:35.338]  And it was a fictional series of how the Soviets moved into this country and took it over by force.
[02:08:36.138 --> 02:08:39.580]  And also another movie called Red Dawn.
[02:08:41.581 --> 02:08:44.442]  It's that type of mentality that we're seeing.
[02:08:44.983 --> 02:08:48.484]  Yes, arresting people for their speech is Red Dawn.
[02:08:48.765 --> 02:08:49.145]  Yep.
[02:08:49.765 --> 02:08:57.249]  And another movie which I saw last night on one of the cable channels, which is called Dark Blue...
[02:08:57.964 --> 02:09:11.629]  It's about corrupt cops, how they went into a black neighborhood and just literally just shoot up people left and right, planting drugs, the whole bit.
[02:09:12.189 --> 02:09:15.310]  It's that whole sicko mentality.
[02:09:16.330 --> 02:09:20.572]  And Mark, I'm in support of you.
[02:09:20.972 --> 02:09:23.753]  I used to be a homosexual, but not anymore.
[02:09:23.953 --> 02:09:25.313]  I've turned my back.
[02:09:25.454 --> 02:09:25.774]  I'm now...
[02:09:27.591 --> 02:09:29.252]  Been reading the Bible more.
[02:09:29.792 --> 02:09:30.252]  Amen.
[02:09:30.692 --> 02:09:32.033]  And now I'm a Christian.
[02:09:32.973 --> 02:09:34.353]  Well, that's why we do what we do.
[02:09:34.433 --> 02:09:40.695]  Because we do care about the homosexual people that are celebrating their sin openly in the streets of America.
[02:09:40.715 --> 02:09:41.776]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:09:42.416 --> 02:09:50.859]  And I think it is time that we as citizens, and I myself, stand up for America.
[02:09:51.499 --> 02:09:51.779]  Amen.
[02:09:51.959 --> 02:09:53.520]  Truly stand up for America.
[02:09:53.980 --> 02:09:57.201]  Because if we don't, we're going to face the day of judgment.
[02:09:58.063 --> 02:09:58.403]  That's right.
[02:09:59.704 --> 02:10:00.084]  All right.
[02:10:00.124 --> 02:10:02.785]  Well, thanks for holding in those interesting points, Jim.
[02:10:03.285 --> 02:10:03.605]  Thank you.
[02:10:04.605 --> 02:10:06.386]  Let's talk to Ken in California.
[02:10:06.446 --> 02:10:07.286]  Ken, you're on the air.
[02:10:07.346 --> 02:10:07.826]  Go ahead.
[02:10:09.747 --> 02:10:11.108]  Yes, Michael, I have a question for you.
[02:10:11.188 --> 02:10:17.650]  Under the First Patriot Act, there was a provision that said that the mere advocacy of a crime was a felony.
[02:10:18.035 --> 02:10:26.942]  In other words, if you were to tell a homosexual that I believe you should be executed, or even if you tell a homosexual I believe God should execute you, under that Patriot Act, that's a felony.
[02:10:27.262 --> 02:10:29.224]  Now, I take it you didn't do anything like that.
[02:10:29.284 --> 02:10:29.824]  Is that correct?
[02:10:30.305 --> 02:10:33.967]  No, no, we didn't do anything like that, but they're saying the word repent.
[02:10:34.628 --> 02:10:39.752]  The word, you know, turn from your sin is what, it was the hate crime.
[02:10:40.270 --> 02:10:43.051]  No, that's ridiculous.
[02:10:43.151 --> 02:10:51.893]  Look, you have a right to go out and tell people that your view that they are in sin, that they need to turn and repent.
[02:10:52.213 --> 02:11:00.616]  And look, anti-war demonstrators have the right to go out and be for the war or against the war and to say George Bush is a criminal.
[02:11:01.289 --> 02:11:17.558]  I mean, look, folks, you've got Michael Savage calling for arresting anybody that disagrees with the government and, quote, putting all the liberals in forced labor camps, and then you've got the, quote, liberals out grabbing people and whole groups of men and women out peacefully protesting, wanting to put them under the jail.
[02:11:17.878 --> 02:11:23.861]  Regardless, the system is setting it up to put us in prison for no reason and to violate the First Amendment.
[02:11:24.321 --> 02:11:24.782]  No, no, no.
[02:11:24.982 --> 02:11:26.123]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[02:11:26.143 --> 02:11:27.564]  We're living in an Orwellian world.
[02:11:27.604 --> 02:11:32.428]  I mean, and to think it doesn't matter whether it's a Democrat in office, a Republican, whoever's in the Congress.
[02:11:32.889 --> 02:11:36.152]  We seem to be marching headlong into this new world order.
[02:11:36.232 --> 02:11:37.313]  It's really disgusting.
[02:11:38.654 --> 02:11:43.158]  Well, we always warn people this is what they do with all the hate crimes legislation, and now they're doing it.
[02:11:43.458 --> 02:11:46.521]  And Mike, earlier, a caller said, you know, don't let this be a chilling effect.
[02:11:46.581 --> 02:11:47.081]  No, no, no.
[02:11:47.521 --> 02:11:50.224]  They're having to do this because free speech can defeat them.
[02:11:50.891 --> 02:12:01.495]  You know, they can demonize the anti-abortion people all day long, but major polls show that the majority of young people and adults have switched from being pro-abortion to being anti-abort.
[02:12:01.895 --> 02:12:03.356]  We're actually winning.
[02:12:03.696 --> 02:12:04.957]  That's why they're panicking.
[02:12:05.297 --> 02:12:10.719]  Well, you realize that in Canada, ministers are being thrown in jail right and left for just quoting from the Bible.
[02:12:11.039 --> 02:12:11.439]  No, I know.
[02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:22.869]  In Pennsylvania, I'm sure that Michael Markavage is aware of this, Pennsylvania, what, last year passed a law and told preachers, you better watch what you read out of the Old Testament.
[02:12:22.889 --> 02:12:23.850]  We may arrest you.
[02:12:23.870 --> 02:12:25.572]  I mean, it's despicable.
[02:12:26.533 --> 02:12:27.333]  That's all I have to say.
[02:12:28.513 --> 02:12:29.894]  You mentioned that council meeting.
[02:12:30.194 --> 02:12:35.076]  That was actually me, who was reading from Romans 1 in the New Testament.
[02:12:36.476 --> 02:12:38.957]  I saw another case of that with somebody in California.
[02:12:38.977 --> 02:12:39.677]  Was that you, too?
[02:12:40.238 --> 02:12:41.718]  No, I didn't travel out there.
[02:12:41.738 --> 02:12:47.801]  It's in my own town over here, so I was speaking at... Okay, well, tell folks that story.
[02:12:48.421 --> 02:12:48.721]  Sure.
[02:12:48.821 --> 02:12:56.424]  There was a council meeting July 21, 2004, in which they just appointed a homosexual activist to the council.
[02:12:56.966 --> 02:13:03.068]  The previous person on the council ended up in some kind of a sexual relationship with another council member and then resigned.
[02:13:03.909 --> 02:13:12.412]  So then they strategically placed this person in there and now they had this meeting, which is just a monthly council meeting.
[02:13:12.452 --> 02:13:26.418]  I went there as a resident of Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, which is just outside of Philadelphia, to just ask what direction are they leading the community in and just wanted to speak to the issue of them attracting homosexuals into the town because of
[02:13:26.974 --> 02:13:38.761]  A comment made by this newly appointed homosexual activist in the Philadelphia Gay News where he said that his appointment and the Borough Council hope that this will lead to more gays and lesbians moving to town.
[02:13:38.781 --> 02:13:43.663]  And I just said, well, as a Christian, I'm opposed to this because of what the Bible says in Romans Chapter 1.
[02:13:43.923 --> 02:13:46.445]  I began to read from the Bible.
[02:13:46.825 --> 02:13:49.186]  It was labeled hate speech by the Council President.
[02:13:49.927 --> 02:13:51.968]  It was a unanimous decision to adjourn the meeting.
[02:13:52.392 --> 02:13:57.215]  And then I was dragged out of the meeting and charged the next day with two crimes.
[02:13:57.355 --> 02:14:03.940]  One was disrupting a public meeting and the other one was disorderly conduct, which are now headed to trial.
[02:14:04.060 --> 02:14:09.864]  The district attorney in the court argued that we couldn't just let him go up to the podium and read from the Bible.
[02:14:09.904 --> 02:14:12.746]  That would be homophobic today, was her argument.
[02:14:13.006 --> 02:14:15.608]  Yeah, actually, that was in the mainstream newspaper.
[02:14:16.088 --> 02:14:18.290]  Now again, folks, in America...
[02:14:19.241 --> 02:14:21.162]  Your speech is disappearing.
[02:14:21.542 --> 02:14:25.984]  And if you take Michael Markavage's speech, you lose your speech, too.
[02:14:27.245 --> 02:14:29.846]  I mean, this is really getting scary.
[02:14:31.927 --> 02:14:33.468]  Anything else, Ken?
[02:14:33.888 --> 02:14:34.349]  No, that's it.
[02:14:34.769 --> 02:14:35.709]  All right, thank you for the call.
[02:14:37.290 --> 02:14:46.274]  Yeah, they were quoted in the newspaper, because I read that on air several times, in the local paper as saying, look, you can't criticize a group.
[02:14:46.295 --> 02:14:47.155]  That's illegal.
[02:14:47.961 --> 02:14:48.681]  Right.
[02:14:48.781 --> 02:14:54.122]  So this shows the mindset in Pennsylvania.
[02:14:54.202 --> 02:15:00.844]  I guess that law that the governor passed, what was it, over a year ago, is really being implemented.
[02:15:01.084 --> 02:15:07.305]  The Republican governor, yes, and he did pass it, and the septic intimidation and the play on the hate speech.
[02:15:07.505 --> 02:15:11.586]  That was Mark, that was, what was the name of the governor?
[02:15:12.466 --> 02:15:12.906]  Schweiker.
[02:15:13.186 --> 02:15:15.007]  Yeah, Mark Schweiker.
[02:15:15.607 --> 02:15:15.827]  Mm-hmm.
[02:15:16.816 --> 02:15:19.679]  And he's the one that signed this into law, Republican governor.
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:35.978]  So we now, in this area of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia and the suburb of Lansdowne, which is just outside the city, I'm sure without question these district attorneys are talking to one another and they're discussing these matters and how they can...
[02:15:36.460 --> 02:15:40.882]  Get what they want, and that is the hate crime to be prosecuted.
[02:15:40.982 --> 02:15:42.963]  And folks, this is the commissariat.
[02:15:43.003 --> 02:15:44.464]  This is the political police.
[02:15:44.964 --> 02:15:45.865]  We're in Russia.
[02:15:46.225 --> 02:15:51.687]  If you say something out of favor with the government, they come and arrest you and put you in a gulag for 20 years.
[02:15:51.807 --> 02:15:54.269]  Now, we're now going to be worse than Russia.
[02:15:54.569 --> 02:15:56.029]  It's going to be 47 years.
[02:15:56.049 --> 02:15:59.011]  That's right.
[02:16:00.672 --> 02:16:01.892]  Unbelievable.
[02:16:02.833 --> 02:16:03.313]  We have...
[02:16:03.923 --> 02:16:08.405]  On our website at RepentAmerica.com, the video of what happened in Philadelphia.
[02:16:08.445 --> 02:16:13.348]  I would encourage your listeners to just look at what happened and see if you see these crimes, as I mentioned earlier.
[02:16:13.808 --> 02:16:23.493]  The riots, the criminal conspiracy, the possessions of instruments of crime, failure to disperse, disorderly conduct, obstructing a highway, reckless endangerment of another person.
[02:16:23.993 --> 02:16:27.355]  These crimes are nowhere to be found in that video footage that we have.
[02:16:27.975 --> 02:16:29.376]  And this is what they're trying to...
[02:16:30.926 --> 02:16:38.430]  All right, let's talk to another caller in Boston.
[02:16:38.470 --> 02:16:39.730]  Kevin in Boston, go ahead.
[02:16:40.591 --> 02:16:42.291]  Hello, Alex and Mr. Markovits.
[02:16:42.331 --> 02:16:43.292]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:16:43.332 --> 02:16:51.656]  I do too know and have said that Christians who believe in Scripture and who dare speak out about it are going to be the prime targets of the New World Order.
[02:16:51.716 --> 02:16:54.497]  But I just want to encourage Mr. Michael Markovits that
[02:16:55.140 --> 02:16:58.203]  You know, the New World Order will not be here 47 years from now.
[02:16:59.084 --> 02:17:07.593]  In 1938, Hitler was Man of the Year, and now we have George Bush, but Hitler was gone seven years later in 1945, and it's their time who grows short, not ours.
[02:17:08.854 --> 02:17:10.957]  People wonder when they hear this stuff, and they get frightened.
[02:17:10.977 --> 02:17:13.479]  They say, why does God let evil get so bad?
[02:17:14.020 --> 02:17:17.844]  And I think, thinking about what you've been saying, Alex, I think one answer is,
[02:17:18.434 --> 02:17:25.896]  It makes it easy to make the clear choice and what to do is right when you have Nazi, New World Order, Satanists to go against.
[02:17:25.996 --> 02:17:28.077]  I mean, it's no longer so gray area.
[02:17:28.117 --> 02:17:28.997]  It's pretty clear.
[02:17:30.097 --> 02:17:30.477]  Say what?
[02:17:30.517 --> 02:17:30.817]  Stay there.
[02:17:30.837 --> 02:17:32.538]  I'll let you finish up on the other side, Kevin.
[02:17:32.838 --> 02:17:34.418]  Then Ron in New York and others.
[02:17:35.559 --> 02:17:36.859]  Are you a thought criminal?
[02:17:37.499 --> 02:17:39.340]  You go to an anti-war protest.
[02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:40.580]  You're an environmental activist.
[02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:42.700]  You're a pro-life activist.
[02:17:43.561 --> 02:17:44.501]  Are you creating hate?
[02:17:46.545 --> 02:17:48.006]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:17:48.126 --> 02:17:50.528]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[02:17:50.888 --> 02:17:51.749]  Let me rephrase that.
[02:17:52.129 --> 02:17:53.350]  Oil War III has started.
[02:17:53.650 --> 02:17:56.092]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[02:17:56.512 --> 02:17:59.914]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[02:18:00.335 --> 02:18:04.177]  Why else would the US be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[02:18:04.417 --> 02:18:05.678]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[02:18:06.139 --> 02:18:10.622]  The nations of the earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[02:18:11.042 --> 02:18:15.005]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[02:18:15.545 --> 02:18:21.429]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.
[02:18:21.689 --> 02:18:27.792]  Call Ready Reserves at 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the free booklet and what you can do to prepare.

[02:18:46.403 --> 02:18:48.644]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[02:18:49.065 --> 02:18:53.427]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[02:18:53.687 --> 02:18:59.491]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[02:18:59.731 --> 02:19:03.794]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[02:19:04.074 --> 02:19:09.717]  However, they have become the elite group more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[02:19:09.837 --> 02:19:12.459]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[02:19:14.540 --> 02:19:14.800]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:14.820 --> 02:19:15.020]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:44.855 --> 02:19:47.897]  You and your family members getting enough minerals on the daily diet?
[02:19:48.278 --> 02:19:50.780]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[02:19:51.020 --> 02:19:58.085]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[02:19:58.285 --> 02:20:01.568]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[02:20:01.808 --> 02:20:03.850]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[02:20:04.190 --> 02:20:11.996]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[02:20:12.256 --> 02:20:12.856]  We're good to go.
[02:20:42.416 --> 02:20:46.960]  Seammineral.com The war on terrorism.
[02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:50.063]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:20:50.323 --> 02:20:54.486]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:20:54.907 --> 02:20:55.727]  So what do you do?
[02:20:56.068 --> 02:21:00.651]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:21:01.132 --> 02:21:03.274]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:21:03.734 --> 02:21:04.615]  Sheltering in place.
[02:21:05.015 --> 02:21:18.420]  Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallouts, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:21:18.460 --> 02:21:25.522]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:21:25.942 --> 02:21:27.263]  It's very important to point out again...
[02:21:53.007 --> 02:21:59.814]  That every conceivable group you can imagine across the board is being arrested for absolutely no reason.
[02:22:00.694 --> 02:22:12.005]  That Homeland Security is visiting small toy store owners about possible copyright infringement on knock-off Rubik's Cubes that it turns out are totally legal.
[02:22:13.632 --> 02:22:20.958]  Or veterans complaining to the VA too much, or 17-year-old kids with a bag of marijuana.
[02:22:21.359 --> 02:22:25.502]  Oh, you don't get your rights, we're stripping you of those, or we're charging you as a terrorist.
[02:22:27.043 --> 02:22:31.867]  But then on the other hand, government corruption is more out in the open than ever, and they hardly ever get in trouble.
[02:22:32.267 --> 02:22:33.388]  See, this is tyranny.
[02:22:35.149 --> 02:22:38.692]  And whether you're conservative or liberal, you should be for the First Amendment.
[02:22:38.732 --> 02:22:39.593]  I mean, get it through your head.
[02:22:40.764 --> 02:22:48.090]  We're going to go back here to Kevin and Ron and Ed and Brian and Brad and Jason and everybody.
[02:22:48.110 --> 02:22:51.914]  Do you have any comments on that, Michael?
[02:22:51.954 --> 02:22:52.854]  You've been all over the country.
[02:22:52.874 --> 02:22:54.416]  You've seen this firsthand.
[02:22:54.436 --> 02:22:55.296]  You were in New York.
[02:22:55.336 --> 02:22:57.078]  You saw liberals, conservatives.
[02:22:57.158 --> 02:22:59.500]  It didn't matter just randomly being arrested.
[02:23:00.541 --> 02:23:03.063]  Yeah, it's quite remarkable in the sense that
[02:23:03.573 --> 02:23:23.203]  We can agree that the First Amendment needs to be protected, and I received an email the other day from a homosexual man who said it's a disgrace what happened in Philadelphia, just renouncing very passionately what they did in Philadelphia on October 10th when they arrested 11 Christians, ages 17 to 72, for three felonies and five misdemeanors.
[02:23:27.240 --> 02:23:32.303]  And it's admitted, just standing there on the street praying, that's your new America, folks.
[02:23:32.983 --> 02:23:36.064]  Is anybody else free when these type of tragedies can happen?
[02:23:36.404 --> 02:23:37.465]  The answer is no.
[02:23:38.325 --> 02:23:40.306]  Finishing up what you were saying, Kevin in Boston?
[02:23:41.267 --> 02:23:49.090]  Well, Alex, I dared to exercise my free speech again this morning on NPR's national coverage, and it may be too much time for a few.
[02:23:49.110 --> 02:23:52.732]  I had a 55-second clip where I plugged it, and they were talking about
[02:23:53.223 --> 02:23:57.546]  Saddam Hussein's trial, and the caller before me had said, just hang him without a trial.
[02:23:58.086 --> 02:24:00.267]  And I had a quick response, if I may, or is it too much?
[02:24:00.288 --> 02:24:01.288]  Yeah, go ahead and play it.
[02:24:01.488 --> 02:24:01.869]  Thank you.
[02:24:05.591 --> 02:24:09.193]  Preparations for the trial of the Basque Party generals and leaders, Saddam Hussein.
[02:24:09.553 --> 02:24:12.916]  There was talk last week that some of them will begin court appearances.
[02:24:12.956 --> 02:24:13.636]  We saw a couple.
[02:24:13.896 --> 02:24:17.338]  We may be seeing more in the next six weeks prior to the election.
[02:24:17.739 --> 02:24:18.539]  Go to Boston next.
[02:24:18.599 --> 02:24:19.220]  John's on the line.
[02:24:19.260 --> 02:24:19.640]  Hi, John.
[02:24:19.660 --> 02:24:21.181]  Hi, thank you for taking my call.
[02:24:21.221 --> 02:24:21.321]  Yeah.
[02:24:22.172 --> 02:24:26.093]  I have a question and a quick reaction to the caller Jim, what he had to say.
[02:24:26.113 --> 02:24:34.734]  My question is, how can we say we are not politicizing the rule of law when our own government has made public statements that the Geneva Convention is now obsolete?
[02:24:35.194 --> 02:24:48.657]  And while we charge Saddam Hussein with the crimes under the Geneva Convention, in reaction to what the caller Jim was saying, just hang him now, the problem with that type of message, it's an effective message, but the problem is,
[02:24:49.712 --> 02:25:00.241]  People aren't asking, like Sherm Skolnick of Cloak & Dagger and Alex Jones of InfoWars.com are reporting that the Saddam we have in custody is a known decoy captured, not the real Saddam, like in the Rudolph Hess case.
[02:25:00.661 --> 02:25:10.930]  They point to a comparison of photos of the captured Saddam with ones that our own government claimed was a decoy when he was out in the streets, you know, when Saddam was still clinging to power.
[02:25:11.050 --> 02:25:12.511]  John, let me, if I can.
[02:25:13.392 --> 02:25:15.113]  That's pretty much the best of it there, Alex.
[02:25:16.061 --> 02:25:18.962]  Well, it certainly could be one of the decoys, is what we've been saying.
[02:25:19.022 --> 02:25:23.622]  But bottom line, this is going to be a staged election, staged trial.
[02:25:23.842 --> 02:25:25.503]  Our government put Saddam in.
[02:25:26.083 --> 02:25:28.023]  Our government told him to invade Iran.
[02:25:28.443 --> 02:25:32.784]  So if we're going to try him for all these crimes, how about we try the people that empowered him?
[02:25:32.824 --> 02:25:33.484]  Thanks for the call.
[02:25:33.604 --> 02:25:33.904]  Thank you.
[02:25:34.284 --> 02:25:34.644]  You bet.
[02:25:35.645 --> 02:25:37.945]  Ron in New York, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:25:37.985 --> 02:25:38.445]  Go ahead.
[02:25:39.645 --> 02:25:39.885]  Alex.
[02:25:40.745 --> 02:25:41.046]  Yes, sir.
[02:25:41.306 --> 02:25:43.166]  Your guest mentioned the Patriot Act and...
[02:25:45.163 --> 02:26:05.676]  Two weeks ago, whenever Ashcroft resigned, the ACLJ, American Center for Law and Justice, whose president is Jay Sekulow, and Pat Robertson on his program, made these two comments, lauding and applauding Patriot Act and what Ashcroft, his contribution to that.
[02:26:06.236 --> 02:26:07.257]  And I have the clip here.
[02:26:08.502 --> 02:26:12.945]  The Pat Robertson clip is a minute, and the Jay Sekulow comments are a minute and a half.
[02:26:13.406 --> 02:26:16.728]  I don't think we have time to play those two clips before the break, but what are the rest of your comments?
[02:26:17.368 --> 02:26:18.849]  Well, that was just it.
[02:26:18.909 --> 02:26:20.791]  They lauded and applauded the Patriot Act.
[02:26:20.811 --> 02:26:22.032]  Well, I think the question is this.
[02:26:22.112 --> 02:26:28.736]  What's happened to our so-called Christian leaders who were aiding and abetting the breakdown of the Constitution and Bill of Rights?
[02:26:29.177 --> 02:26:31.178]  Let me get a comment from Michael Markavage on that.
[02:26:31.718 --> 02:26:38.023]  Well, Jay Sekulow is the same man who told the news that Judge Roy Moore should have removed the monument.
[02:26:39.227 --> 02:26:45.232]  So, I don't... And Bush is promoting... Bush promoted to a federal judgeship the guy that went after Moore.
[02:26:46.232 --> 02:26:46.472]  Yes.
[02:26:46.853 --> 02:26:47.033]  Yes.
[02:26:47.553 --> 02:26:50.055]  Which was the... What's his name again?
[02:26:51.596 --> 02:26:54.878]  The guy who was the chief prosecutor, prosecutor.
[02:26:55.719 --> 02:26:57.940]  He put him in office to take the seat.
[02:27:01.923 --> 02:27:02.643]  It's incredible.
[02:27:03.224 --> 02:27:03.804]  Anything else?
[02:27:04.064 --> 02:27:06.566]  Alex, I also called his program the
[02:27:07.573 --> 02:27:24.901]  Several days ago, Jay Sagan, when I asked the question, what about all of the shortwave and, which is not shortwave, regular radio stations in the rest of the country, but not on the East Coast, only shortwave, Alex Jones, I mentioned your name, other... Tell you what, stay there.
[02:27:24.941 --> 02:27:26.562]  We'll finish up on the other side with our guest.
[02:27:26.962 --> 02:27:28.923]  Make a few more calls for him, give you his website.
[02:27:29.183 --> 02:27:29.904]  Stay there, Ron.
[02:27:30.284 --> 02:27:31.664]  I'm Alex Jones, presentplanet.tv.
[02:27:35.837 --> 02:27:36.718]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.219 --> 02:27:38.821]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.743 --> 02:27:42.426]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.542 --> 02:27:48.023]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[02:27:48.223 --> 02:27:55.567]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[02:27:55.867 --> 02:28:00.289]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:28:00.549 --> 02:28:02.870]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste.
[02:28:03.110 --> 02:28:10.394]  Big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[02:28:11.155 --> 02:28:14.819]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[02:28:15.159 --> 02:28:17.682]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[02:28:17.942 --> 02:28:23.869]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[02:28:24.109 --> 02:28:25.671]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[02:28:25.911 --> 02:28:26.832]  Friends, don't wait.
[02:28:26.912 --> 02:28:29.895]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.

[02:29:45.285 --> 02:29:48.968]  You've heard about PAWS from BioOx International and its Bubble Up Technology.
[02:29:49.269 --> 02:29:53.552]  But have you heard about BioOxidous Concentrate that also uses Bubble Up Technology?
[02:29:53.793 --> 02:30:00.739]  BioOxidous Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.

[02:30:35.628 --> 02:30:38.169]  That's D-I-O-O-X dot com.
[02:30:38.329 --> 02:30:42.991]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use BioOx family of products.
[02:30:56.368 --> 02:31:03.131]  What we've been talking about the last hour is only one of hundreds of different points of tyranny coming down upon us.
[02:31:05.773 --> 02:31:17.499]  And the neocon so-called Christian leaders are simply there to keep Christian conservatives under control to make sure we don't struggle too much as the New World Order is set up.
[02:31:18.877 --> 02:31:27.460]  And I'm really glad that Michael Markavich brought up the fact that, you know, Jay Sekulow and the rest of these guys are basically a bunch of New World Order minions.
[02:31:28.721 --> 02:31:42.626]  And yeah, they'll tell you how the chip isn't too bad, and well, the patriarchs of the Lord, and oh, it's to fight the evil Muslims, and you don't hear Jay Sekulow talking about FEMA training to arrest all the homeschoolers.
[02:31:44.307 --> 02:31:47.468]  You know, that the homeschoolers are all evil terrorists.
[02:31:48.741 --> 02:31:49.801]  This stuff's really going on.
[02:31:49.821 --> 02:31:51.061]  I'm not trying to scare people.
[02:31:52.622 --> 02:31:55.342]  You don't hear him talking about real issues.
[02:31:56.162 --> 02:32:02.424]  Has Jay Sekulow ridden to your rescue, Michael, with this clear case of Christians being charged with hate crimes?
[02:32:03.404 --> 02:32:04.924]  No, that hasn't happened.
[02:32:05.604 --> 02:32:09.545]  I wasn't expecting it, but it's remarkable.
[02:32:09.565 --> 02:32:10.905]  I remember the name now.
[02:32:10.945 --> 02:32:11.905]  It's Bill Pryor.
[02:32:11.965 --> 02:32:15.006]  Bill Pryor was the one that Bush had appointed, who was...
[02:32:16.321 --> 02:32:18.282]  Judge Roy Moore is chief prosecutor.
[02:32:18.442 --> 02:32:19.623]  Yeah, rewarded him!
[02:32:20.264 --> 02:32:20.804]  Rewarded him.
[02:32:20.824 --> 02:32:22.745]  But you're not going to hear Jay Sekulow talk about that.
[02:32:23.686 --> 02:32:24.866]  No, we won't hear that.
[02:32:24.886 --> 02:32:43.037]  We'll hear him talk, which was the case, and that's why I brought it up, is that he voiced his support in regards to Judge Moore removing the monument, which is a clear violation of Judge Roy Moore's First Amendment, but we won't go into that.
[02:32:44.753 --> 02:32:49.477]  It's very sad to see these leaders mislead, and that's not a leader.
[02:32:51.519 --> 02:32:52.520]  No, it's certainly not.
[02:32:52.560 --> 02:32:54.361]  Anything else, Ron, in New York?
[02:32:54.381 --> 02:33:07.032]  Pat Robertson said, quote, we owe Attorney General Ashcroft a great debt of gratitude for his role as the Attorney General in bringing in the Patriot Act, etc.,
[02:33:07.979 --> 02:33:12.722]  Jay Sekulow had said on previous broadcasts, he helped.
[02:33:12.802 --> 02:33:15.484]  He said, quote, I helped write the Patriot Act.
[02:33:15.985 --> 02:33:24.651]  And he said in this comment that I had made before to you that he had lunch with Attorney General Ashcroft the week of his resignation.
[02:33:24.671 --> 02:33:35.218]  The logo for the American Center for Law and Justice is we're here to protect, listen to the irony here, we're here to protect your constitutional freedoms.
[02:33:35.856 --> 02:33:38.157]  Now the quote, Alex, biblically is this.
[02:33:38.257 --> 02:33:48.442]  Jeremiah 8, 10 through 12, it says, From the least to the greatest, all are greedy for gain.
[02:33:48.962 --> 02:33:52.444]  Prophets and priests alike, all practice deceit.
[02:33:52.864 --> 02:33:56.886]  They dress the wound of my people as though we're not serious.
[02:33:57.306 --> 02:34:01.689]  What we're talking about is the ultimate seriousness in what's happening.
[02:34:02.089 --> 02:34:04.590]  Peace, peace, they say, when there is no peace.
[02:34:05.327 --> 02:34:07.549]  Are they ashamed of their loathsome conduct?
[02:34:08.129 --> 02:34:09.810]  No, they have no shame at all.
[02:34:10.191 --> 02:34:12.072]  They do not even know how to blush.
[02:34:12.773 --> 02:34:14.754]  So they will fall among the fallen.
[02:34:15.275 --> 02:34:18.537]  They will be brought down when they are punished, says the Lord.
[02:34:20.819 --> 02:34:21.899]  All right, thanks for the call.
[02:34:21.960 --> 02:34:23.120]  Any comments, Michael?
[02:34:23.841 --> 02:34:25.102]  No, that was a good read.
[02:34:26.499 --> 02:34:28.783]  A few more calls and we'll let you go and I'm going to cover some other news.
[02:34:28.803 --> 02:34:30.125]  I'm an honor to have you on with us.
[02:34:30.485 --> 02:34:31.768]  Let's talk to Ed in Utah.
[02:34:31.828 --> 02:34:32.509]  Ed, you're on the air.
[02:34:32.549 --> 02:34:32.969]  Go ahead.
[02:34:33.250 --> 02:34:34.071]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:34:34.131 --> 02:34:36.395]  I have a couple comments and then a quick question for Michael.
[02:34:36.916 --> 02:34:37.417]  First of all,
[02:34:37.955 --> 02:34:43.098]  Hate crime legislation is to the First Amendment what gun control is to the Second Amendment.
[02:34:43.298 --> 02:34:43.618]  Yes.
[02:34:44.039 --> 02:34:45.599]  And that's what's going on, Michael.
[02:34:46.060 --> 02:34:47.981]  And the other thing is this.
[02:34:48.001 --> 02:34:49.262]  Someone brought up Pat Robertson.
[02:34:49.602 --> 02:34:52.724]  It should be noted that he's a millionaire off of trade with China.
[02:34:52.824 --> 02:34:55.305]  He works for Israel's allies, which is Red China.
[02:34:55.705 --> 02:34:59.067]  In fact, Alex, Ron Torrington is his national media director.
[02:34:59.327 --> 02:35:00.268]  He's not even a Christian.
[02:35:00.408 --> 02:35:02.329]  He is a Jewish fellow from Israel.
[02:35:02.989 --> 02:35:05.491]  And that's what I want to lead in with you on my question, Michael.
[02:35:06.171 --> 02:35:06.912]  Are you familiar?
[02:35:07.392 --> 02:35:09.434]  Have you been in contact with Pastor Ted Pike?
[02:35:10.354 --> 02:35:10.975]  Yes, I have.
[02:35:11.015 --> 02:35:13.137]  We've done some shows together.
[02:35:13.197 --> 02:35:13.357]  Okay.
[02:35:13.497 --> 02:35:16.499]  He is the one that's talking about this, and I'll address this to both of you.
[02:35:16.999 --> 02:35:19.181]  Christmas is being replaced with Hanukkah.
[02:35:19.561 --> 02:35:26.607]  Alex, they would have us believe that, like you say mockingly, and I'm glad those evil, quote, Muslims are behind all this takeover of us.
[02:35:26.667 --> 02:35:27.047]  No, no, no.
[02:35:27.407 --> 02:35:29.188]  The Muslims would have nothing to do with Hanukkah.
[02:35:29.428 --> 02:35:30.409]  We know who's behind it.
[02:35:30.789 --> 02:35:36.852]  And Pastor Ted Pike can arrange a story for you, Michael, in the American Free Press newspaper, because I haven't seen it in there yet.
[02:35:37.612 --> 02:35:38.272]  It was published.
[02:35:38.372 --> 02:35:41.014]  It was published on page 10 of the current issue.
[02:35:41.094 --> 02:35:42.915]  Okay, that's why I haven't got on with that.
[02:35:43.515 --> 02:35:45.376]  And just a little finish up here.
[02:35:45.676 --> 02:35:47.717]  Pastor Pike has been emphasizing that, Alex.
[02:35:47.997 --> 02:35:49.678]  When you look at the number of people like...
[02:35:50.198 --> 02:35:56.302]  This Admiral Moore down there in Alabama, it was a group of Anti-Defamation League lawyers that went after him.
[02:35:56.742 --> 02:36:02.826]  Bush, who is in cahoots with Mr. Sharon in this blood-filled New World Order.
[02:36:02.866 --> 02:36:04.587]  They're putting their final touches on here.
[02:36:05.008 --> 02:36:12.853]  And Pastor Pike pulls no punches in pointing out who is behind this and that we need to reclaim Christianity from this Judeo-Christianity.
[02:36:13.153 --> 02:36:14.954]  That's where it stands today, gentlemen.
[02:36:16.224 --> 02:36:16.965]  In my opinion.
[02:36:17.385 --> 02:36:18.446]  Thanks for the call, Ed.
[02:36:18.486 --> 02:36:19.527]  I mean, I'll say this.
[02:36:19.567 --> 02:36:25.151]  I mean, to say Israel's one block, though, I would not say is accurate, Ed.
[02:36:25.511 --> 02:36:34.579]  But I would say that certainly, I mean, the ADL did go after, so did the Southern Poverty Law Center, did go after Judge Roy Moore.
[02:36:35.259 --> 02:36:42.405]  And then people like Sekulow danced around and said, oh, Bush is, you know, fighting for your Ten Commandments while Bush was publicly against it.
[02:36:42.970 --> 02:36:45.052]  So, I mean, it's across the board.
[02:36:45.092 --> 02:36:47.773]  I mean, all these countries are run by corrupt, out-of-control people.
[02:36:48.574 --> 02:36:52.617]  And so you cannot defend Israel on that level.
[02:36:53.017 --> 02:36:57.000]  But at the same time, people know I don't think Israel is the heart of the New World Order.
[02:36:57.580 --> 02:37:00.902]  And Israel is a diverse crowd, just like America is.
[02:37:01.563 --> 02:37:06.066]  And there are certainly elements in Israel, though, that do not like this country and do not like any other free country.
[02:37:06.606 --> 02:37:08.167]  Just like we have those same elements here.
[02:37:08.267 --> 02:37:09.048]  Michael, any comments?
[02:37:09.068 --> 02:37:12.110]  No, I just want to say that
[02:37:12.546 --> 02:37:16.148]  Certainly we know the ADL's efforts for the hate crimes legislation are evident.
[02:37:16.308 --> 02:37:18.449]  They want to promote this on their website.
[02:37:19.649 --> 02:37:21.070]  And that's all I can say about it.
[02:37:21.851 --> 02:37:26.393]  No, the ADL is a horrible organization and very, very un-American.
[02:37:27.353 --> 02:37:29.614]  And so is the Southern Poverty Law Center and the rest of it.
[02:37:29.794 --> 02:37:32.376]  And people better find out about that real quick.
[02:37:33.036 --> 02:37:34.837]  Let's talk to, who's up next here?
[02:37:36.661 --> 02:37:38.062]  Brad in Illinois, you're on the air.
[02:37:38.122 --> 02:37:38.543]  Go ahead.
[02:37:38.763 --> 02:37:39.284]  That's funny.
[02:37:39.344 --> 02:37:44.889]  I didn't see any Jewish groups protesting the Ten Commandments being removed from the Alabama courthouse.
[02:37:45.349 --> 02:37:47.491]  I would think it's more Jewish than it is Christian.
[02:37:47.551 --> 02:37:48.352]  Yeah, I know.
[02:37:48.712 --> 02:37:50.033]  I was going to say that earlier.
[02:37:50.554 --> 02:37:56.239]  Yeah, you've got a Jewish group saying, take down the Ten Commandments.
[02:37:57.080 --> 02:37:58.601]  Plus, I've seen another thing.
[02:37:58.661 --> 02:38:00.283]  I've seen something else happening.
[02:38:01.074 --> 02:38:07.239]  And that is, it's all over the news, why they're making people take Christmas trees down because it's a Christian symbol.
[02:38:07.620 --> 02:38:09.061]  Folks, it's a tannin bomb.
[02:38:09.361 --> 02:38:10.402]  It's a pagan symbol.
[02:38:10.422 --> 02:38:14.105]  And again, I'm not saying you're going to hell if you've got a Christmas tree in your house.
[02:38:14.385 --> 02:38:15.967]  The point is you should know the history of it.
[02:38:16.227 --> 02:38:20.710]  So these idiots are saying, take down the Christmas tree.
[02:38:21.031 --> 02:38:27.596]  Folks, the Christmas tree is a usurpation of what the holiday is really supposed to be about, but now they're even making them take that down.
[02:38:27.936 --> 02:38:28.557]  Any comments?
[02:38:29.097 --> 02:38:29.278]  Yeah.
[02:38:30.417 --> 02:38:34.739]  Jeremiah 10 is what we recommend your listeners read in the Bible.
[02:38:36.099 --> 02:38:38.300]  Well, yeah, the pagans decorated the trees, right?
[02:38:38.821 --> 02:38:39.061]  Right.
[02:38:39.161 --> 02:38:42.642]  Silver and gold, and they brought it in the house.
[02:38:43.402 --> 02:38:47.364]  But the pagans want it out because they think it's a Christian symbol.
[02:38:47.384 --> 02:38:48.745]  I mean, how stupid are they?
[02:38:49.605 --> 02:38:52.186]  Well, that's the most ridiculous thing, you know, is they...
[02:38:52.918 --> 02:39:03.246]  The efforts of some of these organizations like the ACLU and the ADL, they were founded by liberal Jewish people who have no care or concern about the things of God.
[02:39:04.047 --> 02:39:05.648]  And that's where their efforts are going.
[02:39:05.668 --> 02:39:08.350]  Alex, can I ask your guest a question?
[02:39:08.410 --> 02:39:08.670]  Sure.
[02:39:08.871 --> 02:39:15.356]  Well, first of all, I want to tell your guest, Michael, that remember the words of Andrew Jackson, one man with courage is a majority.
[02:39:15.396 --> 02:39:18.978]  And I hate to say this, but it looks like you're going to be standing alone.
[02:39:19.839 --> 02:39:22.041]  You're probably going to get a lot of lip service from
[02:39:22.694 --> 02:39:31.244]  But as I remember the Indianapolis Baptist Temple, I didn't see anybody coming to their rescue either because they were all afraid of their 501c3 relations.
[02:39:31.744 --> 02:39:37.511]  I also wanted to mention Romans 4.15 is the reason why you were charged with all these felonies.
[02:39:38.471 --> 02:39:43.415]  I think it's 415, or Paul writes that where there is no law, there can be no transgression, which makes sense.
[02:39:43.475 --> 02:39:52.722]  But if you remember, if there's a lot of laws, there's a lot of transgressions, and if there's a lot of transgressions, there's a lot of litigation, which means there's a lot of money being exchanged.
[02:39:53.082 --> 02:40:01.509]  So the whole thing here is wrapping you up with all these felonies to get... Yeah, they're setting up a system to get everybody ensnared.
[02:40:01.829 --> 02:40:05.572]  Absolutely, and the last thing I want to say, and I'll get out of here, is I think you should probably...
[02:40:06.894 --> 02:40:24.386]  Go the opposite way that they think you're going to go, and I really think what you should do, if you can find a lawyer that's courageous, which I don't think you can, but if you can, I think your best bet would be to subpoena the prosecutor of your case as a witness for you at your trial.
[02:40:24.986 --> 02:40:30.270]  What they're going to do if you do that, if you're successful in subpoenaing them, they're going to quash the subpoena and
[02:40:30.709 --> 02:40:40.934]  And then they're going to be in a situation where if they go on with your trial and convict you, then you have a rightful duty or a rightful claim to sue the prosecutor for ruining your case.
[02:40:42.495 --> 02:40:43.976]  So you should really do that.
[02:40:43.996 --> 02:40:45.797]  They're going to testify with their feet.
[02:40:45.997 --> 02:40:47.678]  They're going to run away if you subpoena them.
[02:40:47.718 --> 02:40:48.578]  Thanks for the call.
[02:40:48.598 --> 02:40:48.958]  Bye-bye.
[02:40:49.479 --> 02:40:49.979]  Jason?
[02:40:51.259 --> 02:40:51.780]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:40:52.400 --> 02:40:54.361]  I was just thanking the last caller.
[02:40:55.341 --> 02:40:56.522]  Jason, you're on the air.
[02:40:56.542 --> 02:40:57.463]  Where are you calling from?
[02:40:58.143 --> 02:41:00.144]  Actually, I'm calling from Lawrence, Kansas, Alex.
[02:41:00.618 --> 02:41:01.299]  Welcome.
[02:41:01.739 --> 02:41:03.680]  Yeah, thanks for taking me on.
[02:41:04.101 --> 02:41:09.865]  I just wanted to ask Michael if he had any elected officials in his corner at all?
[02:41:10.606 --> 02:41:14.709]  Anybody that's basically going to bat for him in front of the House or the Senate?
[02:41:15.810 --> 02:41:16.531]  Not at this time.
[02:41:16.571 --> 02:41:18.732]  There's no elected officials that we have heard from.
[02:41:19.093 --> 02:41:23.976]  However, there's some interest in this from the Justice Department, but I don't know how far that's going to go.
[02:41:23.997 --> 02:41:27.039]  We're going to just wait until the new year to really...
[02:41:27.686 --> 02:41:28.846]  Uh, kick this off.
[02:41:28.926 --> 02:41:33.168]  Now our arraignment is on January 5th, is when we'll be arraigned.
[02:41:33.248 --> 02:41:34.508]  It's January 5th then?
[02:41:35.028 --> 02:41:36.829]  Yes, the arraignment is January 5th.
[02:41:37.089 --> 02:41:40.490]  And then from there there's going to be, you know, hearing after hearing.
[02:41:40.510 --> 02:41:52.854]  And again, for those that just joined us, dozens of people arrested, now 11 charged, for praying and singing on a street corner and saying, repent.
[02:41:54.827 --> 02:41:58.009]  So, this is your new inciting to violence.
[02:41:58.049 --> 02:41:59.029]  This is your new evil.
[02:42:00.210 --> 02:42:04.592]  Well, hey, Michael and I guess Alex.
[02:42:04.752 --> 02:42:06.773]  Alex, I've got my own program.
[02:42:06.793 --> 02:42:07.713]  I've called in before.
[02:42:08.333 --> 02:42:13.676]  And something I'm doing, basically, is that we know that we're in the end times.
[02:42:13.736 --> 02:42:16.677]  We know that this is going to be a problem.
[02:42:17.217 --> 02:42:22.960]  The thing is, trying to get people, like on your program, you know, it would be...
[02:42:23.702 --> 02:42:33.748]  Since you're a Christian, I'm a Christian, we ought to be asking God at the start of our programs to open people's eyes, turn people's hearts.
[02:42:34.649 --> 02:42:39.872]  Just take a moment and ask His blessing and ask Him to help us.
[02:42:41.033 --> 02:42:45.576]  I guess it's just an important point with me to draw the Lord into all of these.
[02:42:47.529 --> 02:42:50.910]  Well, God is involved in all the problems that we have.
[02:42:51.450 --> 02:42:53.952]  God is involved in everything.
[02:42:53.972 --> 02:42:55.512]  Thanks for the call, Jason.
[02:42:56.313 --> 02:42:58.394]  Give folks your website again, Michael.
[02:42:59.054 --> 02:42:59.574]  Absolutely.
[02:42:59.795 --> 02:43:04.277]  People can watch this videotape of our arrest in Philadelphia on October 10th.
[02:43:04.337 --> 02:43:08.739]  The website is www.repentamerica.com.
[02:43:09.164 --> 02:43:12.467]  That's www.repentamerica.com.
[02:43:12.947 --> 02:43:13.347]  All right.
[02:43:13.407 --> 02:43:15.949]  Well, please stay in contact with me.
[02:43:16.049 --> 02:43:19.772]  I want to watch this case as it develops here in the new year.
[02:43:19.832 --> 02:43:21.713]  And you're going to trial 11 other people.
[02:43:22.774 --> 02:43:23.595]  You and 10 others.
[02:43:24.035 --> 02:43:25.036]  Well, it's down to four now.
[02:43:25.216 --> 02:43:30.940]  The district attorney got rid of the six women, which was, I think, part of their strategy.
[02:43:31.301 --> 02:43:32.021]  Okay, good.
[02:43:32.382 --> 02:43:36.685]  So now it's down to four people there in the lion's den, or there in the furnace.
[02:43:37.629 --> 02:43:45.451]  And they're going to try to, you know, just admittedly, you've got nothing wrong, and police were apologizing when you were taking you out of your jail cells and talking to you.
[02:43:45.771 --> 02:43:51.172]  Everybody knows this is craziness, but it just shows what this government wants to do, and we'll be there standing with you, my friend.
[02:43:51.572 --> 02:43:52.553]  Well, thank you so much, Alex.
[02:43:52.733 --> 02:43:53.033]  You bet.
[02:43:53.053 --> 02:43:53.473]  Take care.
[02:43:53.933 --> 02:43:54.093]  Bye.
[02:43:54.673 --> 02:44:00.654]  Now, let me, I want to hit some final news here, but I also want to try to comment on what the last caller was saying.
[02:44:03.415 --> 02:44:06.816]  He'll bring God into everything we do here on this radio broadcast.
[02:44:08.346 --> 02:44:11.908]  I make no secret about the fact that I consider myself to be a Christian.
[02:44:13.169 --> 02:44:20.074]  But if that means a Christian like Pat Robertson or George Bush, then no, I'm not that type of Christian.
[02:44:22.955 --> 02:44:31.481]  And so the average person driving along in their car listening to this broadcast for the first time, hearing us talk about how we're Christian is going to turn it off real fast.
[02:44:32.071 --> 02:44:36.134]  Thinking, oh my gosh, these are the people that want to bomb and attack all these countries.
[02:44:36.474 --> 02:44:40.457]  These are the people that are engaged in all this lying and scamming and all this.
[02:44:40.998 --> 02:44:42.399]  That's what the media has done.
[02:44:42.419 --> 02:44:48.263]  The same media that holds Bush out as a Christian also acts like what it means to be a Christian is to be a complete demon.
[02:44:51.065 --> 02:44:55.468]  I have a news broadcast, and I have guests on from across the political spectrum.
[02:44:55.689 --> 02:44:56.009]  I have...
[02:44:56.895 --> 02:45:00.277]  Again, pro-lifers on who are being arrested for demonstrating peaceably.
[02:45:00.637 --> 02:45:03.718]  I have anti-war activists who are being arrested for peaceably demonstrating.
[02:45:03.998 --> 02:45:08.280]  And I have anti-homosexual Christian protesters on who are being arrested.
[02:45:08.800 --> 02:45:10.261]  I stand up for the First Amendment.
[02:45:12.402 --> 02:45:14.703]  And I believe in what these groups are doing.
[02:45:14.743 --> 02:45:23.247]  But even if I don't believe in what these groups are doing, even if I disagree with them, I stand up for their right to say what they're saying and what they're doing.
[02:45:24.935 --> 02:45:33.782]  But if you want to know why Pat Robertson and the rest of them do what they do, Janet Reno, in the mid-90s, went after the Christian Coalition.
[02:45:35.103 --> 02:45:50.214]  And the 20-something TV channels he had, the tens of billions of dollars in holdings, Pat Robertson, Pat Racehorse Robinson, Mr. China's doing what it has to do with forced abortion, they need more Planned Parenthood.
[02:45:50.915 --> 02:45:52.776]  And then I'm back as I read his quote.
[02:45:52.796 --> 02:45:53.457]  He said it on CNN.
[02:45:55.840 --> 02:45:56.681]  Why did they do this?
[02:45:56.761 --> 02:45:57.561]  He rolled over.
[02:45:57.621 --> 02:45:59.222]  He totally changed what he was doing.
[02:46:00.023 --> 02:46:02.164]  When Reno went after him, they left him alone.
[02:46:03.485 --> 02:46:10.029]  And now Ashcroft comes in, and all you're going to see is groveling to the government to keep his business interests tax-free.
[02:46:12.030 --> 02:46:12.870]  Now, it's that simple.
[02:46:14.051 --> 02:46:18.894]  And that's why the show is a love fest, same thing with Jay Sekulow, to the government.
[02:46:20.315 --> 02:46:24.277]  And so let's say we're going to have this Antichrist system, this beast worldwide system.
[02:46:25.046 --> 02:46:28.369]  Everybody's going to be sitting there in their homes while the beast is on the throne.
[02:46:30.011 --> 02:46:33.635]  And you're still going to have Pat Robertson's son still going to be on TV.
[02:46:36.237 --> 02:46:38.219]  Paul Crouch is going to be on TV.
[02:46:38.600 --> 02:46:40.081]  They're all going to be on TV.
[02:46:40.502 --> 02:46:42.524]  They're all going to be talking about Jesus, folks.
[02:46:45.327 --> 02:46:47.048]  But it's not going to be the real Jesus.
[02:46:47.528 --> 02:46:48.768]  Watch out for the counterfeit.
[02:46:49.108 --> 02:46:50.249]  Watch out for the fake.
[02:46:50.629 --> 02:46:51.549]  Watch out for the fraud.
[02:46:51.769 --> 02:46:52.910]  Well, they're on TV.
[02:46:52.950 --> 02:46:54.230]  They say they're for Jesus.
[02:46:54.490 --> 02:46:55.871]  They must be for Jesus.
[02:46:56.071 --> 02:46:58.172]  Why, they bring Jesus into everything they do.
[02:47:00.193 --> 02:47:09.776]  I'm not one of these people who, you know, Christ was saying, look at those guys over there on the hill who pray in public, you know, who want everybody to see how good they are.
[02:47:10.677 --> 02:47:11.517]  I'm not one of those.
[02:47:14.053 --> 02:47:15.494]  You know, I'm a big sinner, folks.
[02:47:16.335 --> 02:47:21.379]  And I realize, and I have guilt, and I feel bad about the things I've done and the things I do.
[02:47:22.880 --> 02:47:26.383]  Most people will look at my life, if they knew what my life was really like, and go, well, that guy's a saint.
[02:47:26.423 --> 02:47:27.063]  But no, I'm not.
[02:47:27.083 --> 02:47:28.925]  Because the thoughts I have are horrible.
[02:47:30.106 --> 02:47:32.187]  And they're continuous, just like everybody else.
[02:47:33.208 --> 02:47:36.210]  And I know that it goes against the basic programming that God put in me.
[02:47:37.171 --> 02:47:40.694]  And, you know, we are a fallen creature.
[02:47:42.355 --> 02:47:43.276]  But I just...
[02:47:44.429 --> 02:47:52.234]  When you use the nomenclature of, oh, I'm a Christian, oh, I'm a Christian, it just almost feeds into what the beast system is doing.
[02:47:52.274 --> 02:47:57.798]  I mean, folks, if the beast system is truly coming in, the beast is going to say he's Jesus.
[02:47:58.098 --> 02:47:58.859]  You know that, right?
[02:47:59.119 --> 02:48:12.568]  Well, see, the church has been set up now to, when the Antichrist stands up, he's going to say he's the Christ, and the world's going to kneel, and the churches are going to kneel.
[02:48:13.730 --> 02:48:19.673]  And when they're cutting our heads off, the churches are going to be out there cheering, thinking they're killing devil worshippers.
[02:48:21.894 --> 02:48:23.234]  I mean, that's what the Bible says.
[02:48:23.894 --> 02:48:25.435]  Boy, this can't be the Antichrist.
[02:48:25.455 --> 02:48:26.215]  This is Jesus.
[02:48:26.436 --> 02:48:27.576]  We would have all been raptured.
[02:48:27.756 --> 02:48:29.557]  We're not going to be here when the Antichrist is here.
[02:48:32.378 --> 02:48:34.959]  Man, I tell you, you wonder how they were going to... Pat Robertson.
[02:48:35.219 --> 02:48:36.780]  Well, the chip isn't the mark of the beast.
[02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:39.601]  You know, all these guys.
[02:48:40.261 --> 02:48:41.222]  Oh, the chip's great!
[02:48:43.032 --> 02:48:44.694]  Sean Hannity said, I want one!
[02:48:45.615 --> 02:48:49.960]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.140 --> 02:48:54.586]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.706 --> 02:48:59.111]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.151 --> 02:49:00.493]  The New World Order.
[02:49:02.254 --> 02:49:06.497]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.537 --> 02:49:13.481]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.601 --> 02:49:15.683]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:15.963 --> 02:49:26.390]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.610 --> 02:49:30.353]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video,
[02:49:30.913 --> 02:49:30.953]  888-253-3139.
[02:49:30.973 --> 02:49:32.556]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:49:45.097 --> 02:49:51.343]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:49:51.483 --> 02:49:57.648]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:49:57.928 --> 02:50:06.316]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:50:06.596 --> 02:50:13.618]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:50:13.918 --> 02:50:18.759]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:50:18.959 --> 02:50:24.380]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:50:24.720 --> 02:50:27.741]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:50:28.121 --> 02:50:36.092]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:36.132 --> 02:50:36.693]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:50:46.195 --> 02:50:52.117]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:52.357 --> 02:50:54.618]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:50:54.798 --> 02:51:01.160]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver, 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:51:01.540 --> 02:51:02.140]  I think so.
[02:51:17.048 --> 02:51:17.568]  We're good to go.
[02:51:17.588 --> 02:51:17.888]  I think?
[02:51:51.657 --> 02:52:05.240]  Of course, you already know the good news is they found the eight-month-old baby alive after that psychopathic demon had cut it out of the mommy in Kansas.
[02:52:06.201 --> 02:52:08.121]  The murder was in Missouri, in Kansas City.
[02:52:09.661 --> 02:52:12.402]  But I'm glad the father got his daughter back.
[02:52:14.503 --> 02:52:16.203]  And I think prayers really did count there.
[02:52:18.988 --> 02:52:20.890]  And there's just so much other news here.
[02:52:20.910 --> 02:52:25.754]  I mean, it's just the level of tyranny that we have coming upon us.
[02:52:26.915 --> 02:52:39.946]  Last Friday night, Bush had a signing ceremony during the day and then a party at night over passing parts of Patriot Act II and the National ID card, and it even had amnesty provisions in it where the illegal aliens get driver's licenses and everything.
[02:52:42.882 --> 02:52:48.085]  Android security, intelligent military operative coming to a prison or police station near you.
[02:52:48.165 --> 02:52:52.907]  Future police state use of ASIMO, the robot.
[02:52:54.028 --> 02:52:59.790]  A visitor writes, I saw the robot story on Honda's new robot, the very scary Terminator 2 stuff.
[02:52:59.850 --> 02:53:02.051]  Here's what I fear the technology will be used for.
[02:53:02.572 --> 02:53:04.533]  Comment, this isn't even a joking matter.
[02:53:04.553 --> 02:53:11.236]  They're already admitting using unmanned drone planes to spy on Americans and automated systems to control the goal.
[02:53:11.986 --> 02:53:18.932]  What kind of commercial benefit is there in all this thing does is shake people's hands and talk back to them in generic robot speak?
[02:53:19.573 --> 02:53:35.747]  I see Homeland Security psychopaths linking their lips at the security applications of the new robot that can run, I'm thinking crowd control, noise weapon emitters, in a setting where it tasers anyone who gets within 10 feet of specific areas.
[02:53:36.347 --> 02:53:38.449]  All that's missing is the black ski mask.
[02:53:39.292 --> 02:53:39.572]  Yeah.
[02:53:39.972 --> 02:53:53.756]  Or maybe in the future, the robots will rebel against their masters, forcing President Arnold Schwarzenegger to declare war on robots and those that harbor robots, thus re-assuming his Terminator mantle and fighting the evildoer robots.
[02:53:54.696 --> 02:53:59.698]  Okay, that last part was a joke, but the way the world is heading, I wouldn't laugh too hard.
[02:54:00.238 --> 02:54:04.179]  Flashback, and then we've got a picture of the THX-1138 robots.
[02:54:05.619 --> 02:54:07.440]  Got this new robot that'll run around and
[02:54:08.140 --> 02:54:09.120]  Walks like a person.
[02:54:10.961 --> 02:54:16.523]  And I've got the Marines on video admitting they've got combat mechs that are classified.
[02:54:16.543 --> 02:54:18.344]  And I've seen it in the news.
[02:54:18.364 --> 02:54:22.686]  They've got these little mini army tanks with all these weapons to drive around and control our lives.
[02:54:23.026 --> 02:54:29.268]  What's dangerous about these is such a few, just a small number of globalists could control them.
[02:54:29.669 --> 02:54:32.190]  Bush plans to tighten budget to slash deficit.
[02:54:33.290 --> 02:54:37.872]  If you really believe that, we have the biggest, he said that last time, we have the biggest deficit ever and
[02:54:39.440 --> 02:54:42.382]  Pentagon reporting they're going to domestically spy on the American people.
[02:54:42.803 --> 02:54:43.783]  That's USA Today.
[02:54:43.843 --> 02:54:46.125]  That's already been going on for a while.
[02:54:46.566 --> 02:54:53.591]  A National Guardsman, this is out of the Associated Press, had sex with a 17-year-old man.
[02:54:54.972 --> 02:54:58.915]  He was a male guardsman and then just went ahead and blew his head off so he wouldn't have any trouble from him.
[02:54:59.335 --> 02:55:02.358]  That's the kind of liberation that's going on over in Iraq.
[02:55:04.713 --> 02:55:21.402]  Before I end this broadcast, I do just want to wish everybody a happy and safe and healthy holiday and remember what Christmas is really all about and to spend time with your family and think about the state of the world and make a New Year's resolution to fight the New World Order, but we'll be back long before the New Year.
[02:55:22.943 --> 02:55:24.844]  A lot of big rebroadcasts coming up this week.
[02:55:24.884 --> 02:55:31.047]  I've never taken off this much time, but I'm going to take a few days off because we've got a lot of great rebroadcasts and I need to spend some time with my family.
[02:55:31.087 --> 02:55:34.069]  I've been working too hard for too long and I'm going to take a few days off.
[02:55:35.115 --> 02:55:42.417]  But in closing, we've got some specials going just for a couple more days, upwards of 70% off on some of my best films.
[02:55:43.057 --> 02:55:50.979]  Visit InfoWars.com to order via the safe, secure online shopping cart and to take advantage of these specials while they last just a day or two more.
[02:55:50.999 --> 02:55:52.820]  Or call toll-free.
[02:55:53.747 --> 02:55:55.607]  Ask about the different titles and different specials.
[02:55:56.227 --> 02:55:57.308]  No obligation to buy.
[02:55:57.368 --> 02:55:58.068]  Just give them a call.
[02:55:58.088 --> 02:55:58.488]  Get the videos.
[02:55:58.508 --> 02:55:58.568]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:55:58.588 --> 02:55:59.408]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:55:59.428 --> 02:56:00.268]  Or just write to me.
[02:56:00.288 --> 02:56:03.229]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[02:56:03.449 --> 02:56:05.149]  And don't forget PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:56:05.549 --> 02:56:09.030]  We've added a new video there, Anthony Hilder's Illuminati.
[02:56:23.712 --> 02:56:25.114]  Luminazi, good word for him.
[02:56:25.134 --> 02:56:27.596]  And all my films as well, 15 cents a day.
[02:56:28.157 --> 02:56:31.520]  PrisonPlanet.tv God bless you all.
[02:56:31.540 --> 02:56:32.781]  See you back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:32.821 --> 02:56:33.722]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:35.724 --> 02:56:36.285]  Hello, folks.
