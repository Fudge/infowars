[00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.030]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.731]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.471 --> 00:00:09.571]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:11.031]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:12.692]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.372 --> 00:00:17.033]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.553 --> 00:00:21.673]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.914 --> 00:00:28.575]  Music
[00:00:35.847 --> 00:00:37.088]  All right, my friends.
[00:00:37.348 --> 00:00:38.069]  We're live.
[00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:44.152]  It's already Thursday, the eighth day of the new year, January 8th, 2004.
[00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:51.416]  We have several very important and informative guests coming on the show today.
[00:00:51.496 --> 00:00:57.160]  We have Brett Bursey coming on, fined for exercising his right to free speech.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.222]  They wanted six months in prison and a $5,000 fine.
[00:01:01.282 --> 00:01:02.243]  John Ashcroft did.
[00:01:02.303 --> 00:01:02.883]  He's the guy that
[00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:08.053]  Stood in a crowd of hundreds of Bush supporters with signs saying they love Bush.
[00:01:08.574 --> 00:01:10.541]  He had a sign saying no blood for oil.
[00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.451]  The federal judge says this is totally American.
[00:01:41.536 --> 00:01:44.559]  This is what America and Russia and China are all about.
[00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:46.460]  So that's coming up.
[00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:59.931]  Also in the third hour, Bob Chapman, who's done a lot of amazing predictions over the years on this show and this network, the international forecaster head, will be joining us to talk about the economy in the third hour.
[00:02:01.393 --> 00:02:05.176]  And of course, the open borders and all the other key issues.
[00:02:05.376 --> 00:02:07.338]  Big show lined up for you.
[00:02:07.778 --> 00:02:08.819]  A ton of news here.
[00:02:10.015 --> 00:02:10.315]  U.S.
[00:02:10.376 --> 00:02:13.759]  copter goes down in Iraq, killing nine.
[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.601]  U.S.
[00:02:15.741 --> 00:02:19.504]  reasserts right to declare citizens to be enemy combatants.
[00:02:20.125 --> 00:02:22.587]  The New York Times, they don't care what the judge says.
[00:02:23.368 --> 00:02:24.910]  Pentagon presses for U.S.
[00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.511]  operation in Lebanon.
[00:02:26.571 --> 00:02:28.573]  Oh, yeah, I want to go ahead and start a war there.
[00:02:29.354 --> 00:02:31.116]  IMF says rise in U.S.
[00:02:31.216 --> 00:02:32.937]  debt is threat to world economy.
[00:02:33.238 --> 00:02:34.479]  You should know you're behind it.
[00:02:35.438 --> 00:02:36.078]  Yeah, no kidding.
[00:02:56.883 --> 00:03:03.248]  Blair pledges to quit if proven to be a liar about the David Kelly affair.
[00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:08.652]  Well, you are a liar, so how can we believe a liar that you'll quit if you're caught to be a liar?
[00:03:09.753 --> 00:03:13.036]  You said you'd quit if weapons of mass destruction weren't found, you liar.
[00:03:14.297 --> 00:03:16.318]  Again, you're just a little socialist minion.
[00:03:16.338 --> 00:03:22.143]  That's why George Bush and the conservative neocons who aren't conservative love you so much.
[00:03:23.757 --> 00:03:24.658]  You're so good.
[00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:28.362]  You're Bill Clinton's big buddy, too, but oh, you really love Bush, don't you?
[00:03:29.143 --> 00:03:31.185]  Democrats should love Bush in this country.
[00:03:31.225 --> 00:03:37.913]  I mean, you want open borders, big government, gun control, loss of freedom, everything Bill Clinton tried, you're getting it.
[00:03:38.513 --> 00:03:44.360]  So if you get past the rhetoric, you NPR listeners out there should love George W.
[00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.450]  And the scary news, U.S.
[00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.272]  looking for dirty bombs in five cities.
[00:03:50.472 --> 00:03:53.574]  Bio-weapons experts still on high alert.
[00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:56.916]  Use detectors hidden in briefcases.
[00:03:57.096 --> 00:03:59.418]  Oh, they're trying to keep us safe.
[00:03:59.918 --> 00:04:02.560]  Experts seeking dirty bombs will get into that.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.422]  Also, expect Al-Qaeda to attack regularly in 2004.
[00:04:07.783 --> 00:04:08.663]  That's what the U.S.
[00:04:08.703 --> 00:04:09.444]  government's saying.
[00:04:09.664 --> 00:04:12.906]  Ah, yes, for the election year, you can bet on it.
[00:04:14.142 --> 00:04:18.724]  Also, Judge lifts ban on Pentagon anthrax shots because they wouldn't approve it.
[00:04:18.764 --> 00:04:21.885]  The FDA wouldn't approve it, so a judge said you can't keep giving this to the troops.
[00:04:22.906 --> 00:04:25.907]  So the FDA said, okay, it's approved in about four days.
[00:04:26.927 --> 00:04:31.609]  They've been giving it for 14 years, and they admit it's killed a bunch of people.
[00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.032]  And so now it's back to giving the troops the shots.
[00:04:39.907 --> 00:04:45.250]  That's a small percentage of the news that we'll be detailing after this quick break.
[00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.771]  You do not want to miss this broadcast.
[00:04:47.172 --> 00:04:48.312]  Please stay with us.
[00:04:49.053 --> 00:04:53.275]  And we'll take calls in this first hour, early in the show, at 1-800-259-9231, infowars.com, the website.
[00:05:00.987 --> 00:05:05.332]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.512 --> 00:05:09.936]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.097 --> 00:05:14.461]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:15.863]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.643 --> 00:05:17.624]  Can emerge.
[00:05:17.644 --> 00:05:21.869]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:21.929 --> 00:05:28.857]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:28.997 --> 00:05:31.000]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:41.705]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:41.985 --> 00:05:47.348]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[00:06:23.829 --> 00:06:30.294]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:06:30.454 --> 00:06:32.336]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:06:32.536 --> 00:06:38.561]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:38.801 --> 00:06:44.486]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[00:06:51.973 --> 00:06:52.856]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.427 --> 00:07:02.229]  Got $3 in your pocket?

[00:07:21.385 --> 00:07:23.026]  Call Term Busters now.
[00:07:23.086 --> 00:07:23.627]  We're good to go.

[00:07:54.435 --> 00:07:54.655]  Big Brother.
[00:07:54.675 --> 00:07:55.095]  Mainstream media.
[00:07:55.115 --> 00:07:55.655]  Government cover-ups.
[00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:56.496]  You want answers?
[00:07:56.576 --> 00:07:57.476]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.547 --> 00:08:17.188]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.708 --> 00:08:21.809]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.150]  All right, my friends.
[00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:28.391]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:08:28.911 --> 00:08:31.311]  This show is not about hypocrisy.
[00:08:31.812 --> 00:08:33.092]  It's not about left and right.
[00:08:33.152 --> 00:08:34.452]  It's about right and wrong.
[00:08:35.893 --> 00:08:37.573]  We're not hypocrites here on this show.
[00:08:39.011 --> 00:08:40.311]  Before I get into the U.S.
[00:08:40.691 --> 00:08:49.673]  copter goes down in Iraq killing nine and tons of other very important news, I meant to get to this yesterday and I didn't, so I'm going to cover it right now.
[00:08:50.694 --> 00:09:00.476]  Now, on Monday, I was ranting and raving about the set, the Hollywood stage that the Crawford Ranch is just north of where I sit in Austin, Texas.
[00:09:01.767 --> 00:09:04.410]  Bush goes out there and poses in a cowboy hat.
[00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:05.491]  Oh, we can trust him.
[00:09:05.531 --> 00:09:06.572]  He's a man of the earth.
[00:09:06.632 --> 00:09:09.335]  He's a good Texan like John Wayne.
[00:09:09.375 --> 00:09:10.296]  He's so wonderful.
[00:09:11.678 --> 00:09:13.560]  That's the illusion we're given.
[00:09:15.433 --> 00:09:17.374]  But there's other better examples.
[00:09:17.454 --> 00:09:30.281]  The turkey that no one was allowed to eat that Bush brought out with all the fixings on it to show to the troops like he was bringing them food, or Bush landing on the aircraft carrier, and then talking about what a great fighter jockey he is in the media.
[00:09:30.381 --> 00:09:31.262]  What a man.
[00:09:31.282 --> 00:09:34.703]  The guy really went AWOL, but no real discussion of that.
[00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:35.504]  Or going to St.
[00:09:35.544 --> 00:09:43.088]  Louis and having Made in USA spray-painted on the boxes at the warehouse and Made in China taped over, which is a felony, by the way.
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.081]  These are just some of the examples.
[00:09:47.141 --> 00:09:54.286]  Going to Indiana and the Secret Service, ordering the entire crowd of thousands of people to take their ties off, and then a few refused.
[00:09:54.326 --> 00:10:01.911]  They threatened to throw them out or arrest them because they wanted to, quote, give the image of the general public working class folks.
[00:10:02.471 --> 00:10:05.674]  I mean, that's the level of micromanagement and control.
[00:10:05.974 --> 00:10:07.615]  And Bill Clinton did that stuff, too.
[00:10:08.716 --> 00:10:10.197]  Bill Clinton engaged in that as well.
[00:10:10.897 --> 00:10:14.660]  It came out in the Oregonian and the Associated Press last year.
[00:10:15.407 --> 00:10:16.508]  I think we're good to go.
[00:10:38.428 --> 00:10:39.969]  That this was in the local papers.
[00:10:40.049 --> 00:10:47.811]  Witnesses saw black helicopters flying around the day before he arrived in that morning, and that every time they'd take off, a fire would start.
[00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:54.113]  About eight different fires started in one day, and so Bush stood there with flames behind him and smoke.
[00:10:54.633 --> 00:10:59.675]  Now, we can't say they did that, but the paper even said that locals believe they did.
[00:11:00.905 --> 00:11:01.526]  We're good to go.
[00:11:01.546 --> 00:11:01.786]  I think?
[00:11:20.059 --> 00:11:32.587]  She admits it's a fable, the weapons of mass destruction, the fake Niger document, fake mobile weapons labs, 12-year-old dossiers written by college students, Powell holding it up as the latest British intelligence.
[00:11:32.967 --> 00:11:34.688]  They're lying to us, okay?
[00:11:34.928 --> 00:11:36.289]  They admit they're lying to us.
[00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:41.012]  Fake terror alerts, that's all been proven, that's all admitted, but put on the back burner.
[00:11:43.672 --> 00:11:45.473]  So we know that they stage.
[00:11:45.553 --> 00:11:48.834]  We know that it's an advertisement technique of propaganda.
[00:11:49.034 --> 00:11:50.734]  It's a pitch, okay?
[00:11:50.874 --> 00:11:51.635]  That's what's happening.
[00:11:51.655 --> 00:12:01.218]  They're using high-tech advertisement techniques to sell us an image, to sell us an idea that they're our saviors, give our rights up, they'll keep us safe.
[00:12:02.678 --> 00:12:04.719]  But the hypocrisy comes in here.
[00:12:04.759 --> 00:12:06.299]  This is off Rush Limbaugh's website.
[00:12:06.599 --> 00:12:08.520]  The making of the money shot.
[00:12:09.907 --> 00:12:25.658]  And it says, did any of you wonder when you saw this photo of Howard Dean and Bill Bradley Tuesday in Iowa, how the diminutive Dr. Dean, who claims to be 5'8 and 3 quarters, appears the same size as 6'5 former NBA star?
[00:12:25.998 --> 00:12:26.738]  We did too.
[00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:33.443]  Well, the images below, grabbed from CNN's coverage, show us how that feat was pulled off with some skillful platform.
[00:12:34.155 --> 00:12:36.457]  They switch places, Dean steps up, and Bradley steps down.
[00:12:36.837 --> 00:12:41.161]  The series of images show from behind how their position switch puts them at a relatively equal height.
[00:12:59.801 --> 00:13:17.258]  Having duped their willing accomplices in the media, and they think all of us, you idiots in America, they turn for the money shot, and suddenly our vertically challenged Democrat frontrunner is as tall as the imposing looking as the former NBA superstar endorsing him.
[00:13:19.199 --> 00:13:23.984]  And yes, this is how they stage things, but that's the oldest thing in the book.
[00:13:24.761 --> 00:13:39.233]  We're politicians that aren't very tall to have a box because you'll have different speakers and the box will be there for the shortest speaker and an aide will slide that into place before the shorter person gets up there.
[00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:41.896]  In fact, every time Bush is giving a speech.
[00:13:42.748 --> 00:13:44.550]  And there's others who are going to give speeches.
[00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.112]  I've seen this time and time again, just never even mentioned it.
[00:13:47.332 --> 00:13:48.654]  This just goes without mentioning.
[00:13:49.915 --> 00:13:51.556]  They have taller speakers up there.
[00:13:52.397 --> 00:13:55.420]  Then an aide will walk up and say, the President of the United States.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.584]  And while he's doing that, when he steps back, an aide is leaning down.
[00:13:59.644 --> 00:14:01.625]  You can watch live speech and see this.
[00:14:01.946 --> 00:14:08.612]  They will place a box into the area so that Bush will be above the microphones at the panel.
[00:14:09.432 --> 00:14:10.152]  At the lectern.
[00:14:10.473 --> 00:14:17.256]  I mean, I've gone and given speeches before, and they've had to adjust things because I'm only 5'10", and they might have a speaker who's 5'5".
[00:14:17.577 --> 00:14:19.157]  You've got to really adjust the podiums.
[00:14:19.378 --> 00:14:20.418]  This is just standard.
[00:14:20.698 --> 00:14:21.779]  It's no big deal.
[00:14:22.539 --> 00:14:24.200]  It is stage managed.
[00:14:24.801 --> 00:14:33.585]  The way they did it was skillfully done, and it is made to make him look as tall as Bradley because he was going to be standing next to him.
[00:14:33.625 --> 00:14:36.627]  That's different than putting a box up to a high lectern.
[00:14:37.808 --> 00:14:37.968]  But...
[00:14:38.792 --> 00:14:55.199]  Again, compared to Bush and the White House admits after they got caught, spray painting with a stencil, Made in USA in big letters over a bunch of boxes, haphazardly like it was real, and then down below, Made in China taped over, that's a felony.
[00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.241]  Ordering people to take their ties off?
[00:14:58.301 --> 00:15:00.662]  I mean, how control freak is that?
[00:15:03.195 --> 00:15:04.716]  I mean, this is amazing, folks.
[00:15:04.957 --> 00:15:10.541]  I mean, I remember when Bill Clinton would go give a speech somewhere, they'd cut down a bunch of ancient trees behind him just so he could see the mountain view.
[00:15:10.981 --> 00:15:11.942]  Bush does that, too.
[00:15:13.483 --> 00:15:26.894]  But why would Rush Limbaugh sit there and make a big deal out of Howard Dean trying to look tall compared to people committing felonies or handing out fake turkeys?
[00:15:27.975 --> 00:15:31.458]  And I heard these very talk show hosts, these neocons,
[00:15:32.466 --> 00:15:33.907]  They don't care about open borders.
[00:15:33.947 --> 00:15:36.749]  They don't care about Bush planning to sign the assault weapons ban.
[00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:40.172]  They don't care about all the sell-out of Taiwan to China.
[00:15:40.372 --> 00:15:41.293]  They don't care about that.
[00:15:42.354 --> 00:15:47.518]  They squealed when Hillary went to Afghanistan to present turkeys to the troops.
[00:15:47.978 --> 00:15:49.700]  And, of course, it was a staged event.
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.441]  Yes, it's obvious.
[00:15:51.981 --> 00:15:54.103]  But it was bad when she did it.
[00:15:54.183 --> 00:15:59.007]  And simultaneously, I heard it on one big national show in the same ten minutes, good when Bush does it.
[00:16:00.057 --> 00:16:04.321]  I mean, this is ridiculous double think and double speak, and I'm sick of it.
[00:16:05.602 --> 00:16:13.869]  So, Howard Dean is evil and duping the idiots and the willing accomplices in the media because he stood on a box.
[00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:21.936]  But George Bush would never do such a thing out there at his ranch, which is a total and complete set.
[00:16:22.917 --> 00:16:23.458]  Admittedly.
[00:16:24.859 --> 00:16:27.201]  Complete with old tractors, hay bales, all of it.
[00:16:28.328 --> 00:16:32.349]  Out there cutting brush from time to time, riding fence.
[00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:36.330]  You could just see him riding over the hill with Davy Crockett.
[00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:40.732]  So we continue to just buy into all of this.
[00:16:40.912 --> 00:16:42.812]  I, for one, am so tired of it.
[00:16:42.832 --> 00:16:48.354]  But this is a great example of the amazing level of hypocrisy.
[00:16:49.574 --> 00:16:51.715]  Total and complete hypocrisy.
[00:16:52.388 --> 00:16:54.650]  Massive hypocrisy.
[00:16:54.990 --> 00:17:00.073]  And the people listening to that show and going to that website won't even remember, won't even be aware.
[00:17:00.373 --> 00:17:03.275]  And if you point it out to them, they'll say, shut up, communist.
[00:17:03.676 --> 00:17:06.618]  I'm handing my guns in as a good conservative.
[00:17:07.558 --> 00:17:09.059]  I'm so sick of you idiots.
[00:17:09.539 --> 00:17:10.180]  I'm serious.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.401]  I mean, neocons are the scum of the earth.
[00:17:12.421 --> 00:17:14.323]  You're the most mindless idiots.
[00:17:15.203 --> 00:17:18.325]  And secondarily, there are the mindless, bug-eyed liberals.
[00:17:18.826 --> 00:17:20.947]  The NPR listeners of this country.
[00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:23.390]  You guys should love George Bush.
[00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:33.195]  Open borders, gun control, selling out Taiwan, supercomputers to China, campaign finance reform, protecting Bill Clinton and blocking Dan Burton's Pardon Gate Commission.
[00:17:35.097 --> 00:17:39.959]  I mean, literally, if you like Bill Clinton's policies, then you should love George Bush.
[00:17:39.999 --> 00:17:41.680]  But again, it's not about actions, is it?
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:42.741]  It's about rhetoric.
[00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:48.904]  If it was really about actions, conservatives, if you hated Bill Clinton, you should hate George Bush.
[00:17:48.944 --> 00:17:51.745]  But see, it's not about reality, is it?
[00:17:51.825 --> 00:17:53.545]  It's about perception.
[00:17:54.025 --> 00:17:56.906]  It's high-tech advertisement spin.
[00:17:57.226 --> 00:18:01.947]  And you're buying it hook, line, and sinker.
[00:18:04.668 --> 00:18:05.928]  So what do you have to say about this?
[00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:07.570]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:19.876]  And Limbaugh, you're now saying there's a conspiracy against you with the money laundering investigations and doctor shopping investigations.
[00:18:19.916 --> 00:18:20.776]  And I'd have to agree.
[00:18:21.797 --> 00:18:25.978]  I mean, yeah, you've got some liberals down there in Florida that don't like you.
[00:18:26.559 --> 00:18:28.440]  And yeah, you're being persecuted with the law.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.121]  They're using the Patriot Act to get at your medical records.
[00:18:31.141 --> 00:18:31.901]  They're using Section 3.
[00:18:33.242 --> 00:18:33.862]  And it's wrong.
[00:18:35.283 --> 00:18:35.403]  And...
[00:18:36.846 --> 00:18:39.067]  But again, no, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:18:39.087 --> 00:18:40.327]  There's no such thing as conspiracies.
[00:18:41.627 --> 00:18:42.287]  You fool.
[00:18:43.068 --> 00:18:56.391]  So just, you know, just stay hopped up on your hillbilly heroin and talk about putting teenage kids in jail for smoking pot while you're hopped up on synthetic heroin, okay, boy?
[00:18:57.212 --> 00:18:58.652]  While you're taking 100 pills a day.
[00:18:58.672 --> 00:19:01.833]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:19:02.093 --> 00:19:03.473]  Again, hypocrisy.
[00:19:04.213 --> 00:19:05.254]  Total hypocrisy.
[00:19:05.374 --> 00:19:06.254]  I am sick of it.
[00:19:09.289 --> 00:19:09.889]  Unbelievable.
[00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:11.730]  Unbelievable.
[00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:12.290]  U.S.
[00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.551]  copter goes down in Iraq, killing nine.
[00:19:14.571 --> 00:19:14.931]  A U.S.
[00:19:14.971 --> 00:19:22.855]  Black Hawk medevac helicopter crashed Thursday near a stronghold of the anti-American insurgency, killing all nine soldiers aboard, U.S.
[00:19:22.875 --> 00:19:23.635]  military said.
[00:19:24.615 --> 00:19:28.577]  Also Thursday, a soldier died of injury suffered by a motor attack.
[00:19:29.237 --> 00:19:33.679]  A day earlier, the wounded 33 other troops and a civilian west of Baghdad.
[00:19:34.441 --> 00:19:44.809]  Hundreds of angry Iraqis, meanwhile, waited outside Baghdad's infamous Abu Ghraib prison for a much-publicized release of detainees that did not occur by late afternoon.
[00:19:47.411 --> 00:19:51.434]  All right, I just got unbelievable news about they want to invade Lebanon now.
[00:19:51.494 --> 00:19:53.015]  Their Pentagon wants that.
[00:19:53.455 --> 00:19:56.257]  And just the news is all very important.
[00:19:56.598 --> 00:19:57.538]  I hope you'll stay with us.
[00:19:57.558 --> 00:19:58.219]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:02.984 --> 00:20:07.987]  Late summer 2003, mainstream press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[00:20:08.388 --> 00:20:11.130]  Late summer 2002, I heard the same thing.
[00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.452]  Late summer 2001, you heard the same thing.
[00:20:14.832 --> 00:20:21.977]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently trading in the 93 to 9400 range, is down 7% from two years ago.
[00:20:22.477 --> 00:20:23.378]  That's recovery?
[00:20:23.998 --> 00:20:29.202]  Gold, now trading in the $360 range, is up 31% in that same period.
[00:20:29.602 --> 00:20:31.123]  Where do you want your hard-earned money?
[00:20:31.806 --> 00:20:34.567]  Hi folks, this is Jack Brown with Midas Resources.
[00:20:39.268 --> 00:20:40.849]  I love the sound of real money.

[00:20:47.031 --> 00:20:51.612]  Learn how to protect your assets with real wealth, not potentially worthless paper.
[00:20:51.972 --> 00:20:52.812]  Call now, 800-686-2237.
[00:20:52.852 --> 00:20:53.052]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.762 --> 00:21:02.984]  Hey, John Statman here, and I have a question for you.
[00:21:03.184 --> 00:21:04.725]  Are you having an energy crisis?
[00:21:05.065 --> 00:21:07.707]  No, I'm not talking about the rising cost of gasoline.
[00:21:07.927 --> 00:21:09.828]  I'm talking about you, personally.
[00:21:10.089 --> 00:21:13.051]  Do you have the energy you need to do all the things in life that you need to do?
[00:21:13.351 --> 00:21:15.152]  If you're like most people, the answer is no.
[00:21:15.492 --> 00:21:19.215]  And that extra cup of coffee or an afternoon candy bar is not the solution.
[00:21:19.602 --> 00:21:22.463]  There's a safe and effective way to energize your life naturally.
[00:21:22.723 --> 00:21:24.764]  It's called Be Alive Royal Jelly.
[00:21:25.124 --> 00:21:28.405]  If you haven't tried it yet, you're missing out on one of nature's best-kept secrets.
[00:21:28.785 --> 00:21:36.208]  Made naturally in a beehive, not manufactured in a lab, Royal Jelly is used by people around the world for energy, vitality, and stamina.
[00:21:36.488 --> 00:21:37.349]  We're good to go.
[00:21:50.805 --> 00:21:50.965]  866-321-1900.
[00:21:51.025 --> 00:21:59.315]  Tell them John sent you and put an end to your energy crisis with Be Alive Royal Jelly.
[00:21:59.335 --> 00:22:00.036]  866-321-1900.
[00:22:00.577 --> 00:22:08.066]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Lite LED system.
[00:22:08.366 --> 00:22:21.356]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[00:22:21.637 --> 00:22:24.939]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:35.728]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:22:36.028 --> 00:22:36.528]  That's right.
[00:22:36.708 --> 00:22:43.831]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:22:44.111 --> 00:22:52.854]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:52.914 --> 00:22:53.374]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:23:01.058 --> 00:23:01.558]  We're good to go.
[00:23:01.578 --> 00:23:01.718]  I think?
[00:23:17.819 --> 00:23:20.220]  I'm glad to tell you there's an easier way to get it all at once.

[00:24:03.618 --> 00:24:09.659]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:10.259 --> 00:24:13.300]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.961]  All right, folks, I'm going to your calls in the next segment.
[00:24:18.521 --> 00:24:23.002]  Toll-free number to join us on air on this live Thursday edition of the show, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:23.022 --> 00:24:23.082]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:33.234 --> 00:24:35.436]  Another point of hypocrisy by the neocons.
[00:24:35.957 --> 00:24:43.344]  I remember Bill Clinton having anti-Clinton protesters arrested out of crowds of Clinton worshippers.
[00:24:44.766 --> 00:24:48.509]  And the neocons on talk radio would rant and rave and rail against it.
[00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:55.036]  But now that Bush is systematically doing it on a greater scale, I've heard them on air defending it.
[00:24:56.033 --> 00:25:06.000]  Basically, neocons defend Republicans for gun control, defend them for open borders, they defend sweatshops, they defend genetically engineered nightmare foods and animals.
[00:25:07.401 --> 00:25:10.022]  Basically, their job is to sell you slavery, folks.
[00:25:10.623 --> 00:25:16.046]  And the reason I talk so much about them is because conservatives, deep down, are the enemy of the New World Order.
[00:25:16.086 --> 00:25:21.470]  But you've been compromised, you've been diverted, you've been pacified by these people.
[00:25:22.811 --> 00:25:24.772]  And I say you better wake up if you love this country.
[00:25:25.484 --> 00:25:30.149]  Meanwhile, more troops are dying over in Iraq, which is just a tragedy.
[00:25:30.189 --> 00:25:31.291]  But Bush says bring them on.
[00:25:31.311 --> 00:25:34.614]  Hey, he went AWOL, so it's easy for him to say bring them on.
[00:25:35.616 --> 00:25:39.320]  Him and the rest of his chicken hawks there, a bunch of draft dodgers like Clinton.
[00:25:40.117 --> 00:25:40.497]  U.S.
[00:25:40.577 --> 00:25:44.420]  reasserts right to declare citizens to be enemy combatants.
[00:25:45.121 --> 00:25:56.169]  The Bush administration on Wednesday asserted its broad authority to declare America's citizens to be enemy combatants, and it suggested that the Supreme Court consider two prominent cases at the same time.
[00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:01.954]  And with this socialistic court, I mean, they'll probably authorize it, a lower federal court.
[00:26:03.195 --> 00:26:09.820]  Well, the Second Circuit said that, no, you can't grab a citizen under Section 802, call them a terrorist, and they're never seen again.
[00:26:10.956 --> 00:26:21.746]  The Justice Department, in a brief file with the court, said it would seek an expedited appeal of a federal appeals court decision last month in the case of Jose Padilla, jailed as an enemy combatant in 2002.
[00:26:21.946 --> 00:26:35.699]  The divided appeals court of the Second Circuit in New York ruled on December 18th President Bush lacked the authority to indefinitely detain an American citizen like Mr. Padilla, who was arrested on American soil simply by declaring him an enemy combatant.
[00:26:36.201 --> 00:26:40.925]  Mr. Padilla has been held incommunicado as military brig in South Carolina.
[00:26:42.506 --> 00:26:52.013]  And understand, folks, that they're using the whole Patriot Act against topless bars, against Rush Limbaugh, against county commissioners, against speeders.
[00:26:52.674 --> 00:26:56.737]  They're using it all over the country thousands of times.
[00:26:57.117 --> 00:26:58.058]  Thousands of folks.
[00:26:58.358 --> 00:26:58.978]  How do I know that?
[00:26:59.019 --> 00:27:02.141]  Because I'll hear some state attorney or some county attorney say,
[00:27:03.071 --> 00:27:09.534]  In some article, I've seen just dozens and dozens and dozens of these going, oh yeah, we've used it hundreds of times already.
[00:27:10.534 --> 00:27:17.658]  The Justice Department, before Congress early last year, said, oh yeah, we're going to use it for all crimes against citizens.
[00:27:18.198 --> 00:27:19.618]  Of course we'll use all our tools.
[00:27:21.859 --> 00:27:24.361]  That was amazing, but they did that.
[00:27:25.841 --> 00:27:32.164]  So, again, I mean, they're using it over and over again in small towns around this country.
[00:27:33.305 --> 00:27:35.206]  The Jones Department is saying they're using it.
[00:27:37.307 --> 00:27:38.608]  I've seen all these different U.S.
[00:27:38.648 --> 00:27:44.752]  attorneys and state attorney generals and district attorneys in the cities and counties saying they're using it.
[00:27:45.612 --> 00:27:49.155]  I see articles every day where they're using it.
[00:27:50.375 --> 00:27:54.638]  And the most common thing is to charge a pot dealer or a cocaine dealer or some other drug dealer...
[00:27:55.667 --> 00:27:58.049]  For distributing weapons of mass destruction.
[00:27:58.429 --> 00:27:59.409]  I know that sounds crazy.
[00:27:59.429 --> 00:28:00.150]  That's what they're doing.
[00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:01.851]  For selling drugs.
[00:28:01.911 --> 00:28:04.572]  Now possessing drugs are charging people with terrorism.
[00:28:06.073 --> 00:28:07.714]  I hear it on the news all the time.
[00:28:08.314 --> 00:28:12.316]  Police charge man who attacked neighbor with knife with terrorism.
[00:28:12.357 --> 00:28:14.258]  See, everything's terrorism now.
[00:28:16.019 --> 00:28:18.480]  So they can grab you and take you away without a trial.
[00:28:19.392 --> 00:28:27.216]  They're saying they want to put military on the streets and have the military run our lives and have NORTHCOM and Joint Task Force 6 run our lives.
[00:28:28.617 --> 00:28:29.878]  This is not freedom, folks.
[00:28:29.918 --> 00:28:30.738]  This is not freedom.
[00:28:32.199 --> 00:28:34.080]  So we'll see what happens with that.
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:35.841]  Pentagon presses U.S.
[00:28:35.981 --> 00:28:37.482]  occupation in Lebanon.
[00:28:39.639 --> 00:28:40.199]  The U.S.
[00:28:40.699 --> 00:28:50.502]  Defense Department is said to be mulling a proposal to expand special operations forces and send them to destroy insurgency strongholds along the Lebanese-Syrian border.
[00:28:51.663 --> 00:28:52.143]  Oh, great.
[00:28:52.183 --> 00:28:53.523]  Now we're going to attack other countries.
[00:28:53.943 --> 00:28:54.163]  U.S.
[00:28:54.183 --> 00:28:58.164]  defense sources said the proposal is being examined by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:28:58.425 --> 00:29:06.467]  They said the plan calls for a multi-pronged attack on insurgency strongholds such as countries as Lebanon and Somalia.
[00:29:08.277 --> 00:29:14.040]  The global war on terror is continuing, and it will for the foreseeable future, Rumsfeld, who did not cite future U.S.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:25.586]  counterinsurgency targets, said on Tuesday, as we prosecute the war, we'll need to continue to strengthen, improve, and transform our forces, modernize, restructure programs and commands.
[00:29:27.046 --> 00:29:30.008]  And by the way, they are not giving troops medals in Iraq.
[00:29:30.068 --> 00:29:31.469]  I have the article here today.
[00:29:32.289 --> 00:29:36.111]  They're giving all the troops a global war on terrorism medal.
[00:29:37.871 --> 00:29:39.972]  Yes, everyone gets a black beret.
[00:29:40.412 --> 00:29:41.573]  Everyone gets a medal.
[00:29:42.213 --> 00:29:45.614]  They're handing them out like they did in World War II in Germany.
[00:29:45.815 --> 00:29:48.056]  Iron crosses for all the cooks.
[00:29:51.297 --> 00:29:52.197]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.698 --> 00:29:54.298]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.219 --> 00:29:57.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:04.449]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:06.270]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot.
[00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:14.372]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[00:30:14.612 --> 00:30:21.093]  Imagine hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini followed by peaches, mixed fruit, or pineapple for dessert.
[00:30:21.233 --> 00:30:22.473]  Just a few of the many selections.
[00:30:22.693 --> 00:30:26.114]  Visit www.longlifefood.com for a complete menu.
[00:30:26.214 --> 00:30:29.815]  Both FEMA and the Red Cross have suggested having food stored in case of disasters.
[00:30:29.995 --> 00:30:35.517]  The Long Life Food Depot was recently mentioned in the USA Today article on the very subject of emergency preparations.
[00:30:35.817 --> 00:30:38.518]  It makes sense to be prepared, and Long Life Food Depot makes it easy.
[00:30:38.718 --> 00:30:42.739]  Long-term storable MREs make for convenience when camping, hiking, or canoeing.
[00:30:42.979 --> 00:30:45.000]  No fires allowed, hot meals still are.

[00:31:01.226 --> 00:31:01.667]  Gold.
[00:31:02.007 --> 00:31:03.307]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:31:03.548 --> 00:31:09.651]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:31:09.831 --> 00:31:13.653]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:31:14.013 --> 00:31:15.894]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:31:15.954 --> 00:31:16.134]  Mint,
[00:31:16.474 --> 00:31:18.236]  Demand is at an all-time high.
[00:31:18.376 --> 00:31:26.103]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[00:31:26.463 --> 00:31:35.371]  Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and your family from the Fed's plans for your hard-earned money.

[00:32:00.527 --> 00:32:01.168]  We're good to go.
[00:32:21.653 --> 00:32:24.616]  Good health is achievable when you tune into Achieving Great Health.
[00:32:24.636 --> 00:32:30.080]  If you want to learn more on how to naturally rid the body of any disease, listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley.

[00:32:47.155 --> 00:32:47.575]  We're good to go.
[00:33:13.303 --> 00:33:15.085]  All right, folks.
[00:33:39.477 --> 00:33:42.559]  We're about to get into IMF says rise in U.S.
[00:33:42.599 --> 00:33:45.280]  debt is threat to world economy.
[00:33:46.421 --> 00:33:49.983]  China announces second suspected case of SARS.
[00:33:50.844 --> 00:33:53.265]  Bush would give illegal workers broad new rights.
[00:33:53.385 --> 00:33:55.546]  That puts it lightly.
[00:33:57.187 --> 00:33:57.488]  U.S.
[00:33:57.528 --> 00:33:59.529]  looking for dirty bombs in five U.S.
[00:33:59.589 --> 00:33:59.989]  cities.
[00:34:00.249 --> 00:34:01.290]  Oh, sure they are.
[00:34:02.927 --> 00:34:03.687]  And a lot more.
[00:34:04.127 --> 00:34:09.408]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:09.728 --> 00:34:10.929]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:13.409]  Let's talk to Shannon in Colorado.
[00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:13.789]  Go ahead.
[00:34:13.809 --> 00:34:14.389]  You're on the air.
[00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:15.670]  Hello.
[00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:32.033]  I actually, this is the first time I've tuned in to your station, but I've also experienced a lot of, I guess the Lord has kind of shown me a lot of
[00:34:32.961 --> 00:34:37.603]  Stuff that, you know, the government is hiding, like mad cow disease.
[00:34:38.903 --> 00:34:47.727]  We've experienced actually mad cow disease ourselves through members of our family and that kind of thing.
[00:34:47.747 --> 00:34:50.448]  Oh, multiple members of your family?
[00:34:50.468 --> 00:34:53.289]  Well, I mean, how do you know that?
[00:34:53.849 --> 00:34:57.230]  Well, we went to certain different people.
[00:34:58.211 --> 00:35:01.672]  Like, for instance, I was wondering if you ever heard of the man named Dr. Overman?
[00:35:03.593 --> 00:35:04.234]  No, I haven't.
[00:35:04.334 --> 00:35:04.814]  No, you haven't?
[00:35:04.874 --> 00:35:07.777]  Well, he's pretty much right up your alley.
[00:35:08.017 --> 00:35:10.659]  I mean, you guys talk about the same things.
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:19.586]  But he was called into the whole medical field, you know, with naturopathic healing and stuff like that.
[00:35:20.207 --> 00:35:21.087]  Uh-huh.
[00:35:21.207 --> 00:35:24.710]  But he's actually cured lots of people with mad cow disease.
[00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:25.431]  Oh, really?
[00:35:25.551 --> 00:35:25.731]  Yes.
[00:35:26.676 --> 00:35:37.903]  Well, you know, I've had scientists and epidemiologists and all sorts of different doctors on years ago, and they were covering up mad cow.
[00:35:38.003 --> 00:35:43.566]  Many of the Alzheimer's cases were caused by the CJD, by the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
[00:35:43.626 --> 00:35:44.427]  Yeah, that was in 1987.
[00:35:46.728 --> 00:35:47.989]  We're good to go.
[00:36:16.155 --> 00:36:30.083]  Yeah, and I was wondering, because obviously it's widespread, and it's kind of just been covered up, but I was wondering, when everything starts getting more severe, I mean, what do you think that the government is actually going to do with all of us?
[00:36:30.503 --> 00:36:33.485]  Well, more severe, what area?
[00:36:33.565 --> 00:36:35.286]  Well, when we actually start seeing...
[00:36:35.885 --> 00:36:38.807]  The side effects more prevalent and stuff.
[00:36:38.867 --> 00:36:40.948]  Well, we have seen the side effects more prevalent.
[00:36:41.248 --> 00:36:43.990]  Alzheimer's is way up from the vaccines.
[00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:45.331]  Autism is up by over 2,000%.
[00:36:45.371 --> 00:36:47.292]  That's right.
[00:36:47.472 --> 00:36:55.917]  All this stuff, they just quietly misdiagnose it, and the AMA says this is how you diagnose these symptoms, and we'll just go about our business.
[00:36:56.978 --> 00:36:57.278]  Yeah.
[00:36:57.898 --> 00:37:04.382]  But I was just thinking, you know, I was wondering if it was probably going to get worse, and then we're going to see a lot more.
[00:37:04.895 --> 00:37:13.381]  Well, I don't know if it'll get worse if they'll just stop feeding rotten meat to cows and meat to cows and sheep and pigs and other animals.
[00:37:13.421 --> 00:37:14.482]  We won't have that problem.
[00:37:15.163 --> 00:37:15.403]  Okay.
[00:37:16.468 --> 00:37:19.370]  And you think that the government will actually stop doing that kind of thing?
[00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:21.151]  Well, the government doesn't do it.
[00:37:21.611 --> 00:37:23.152]  Private industry's been doing it.
[00:37:23.193 --> 00:37:26.215]  The government regulates it and hasn't been regulating it.
[00:37:26.255 --> 00:37:29.637]  They don't regulate real bio problems.
[00:37:30.077 --> 00:37:33.579]  They simply harass low-level farmers and ranchers.
[00:37:33.619 --> 00:37:34.440]  That's what it's all about.
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:46.328]  Big government works for the big corporations to go after their competition, to put up walls of red tape so it's too expensive for the average person to go into competition against big agri.
[00:37:47.089 --> 00:37:47.549]  Oh, I see.
[00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:49.050]  Yeah, thanks for the call.
[00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:49.731]  Good to hear from you.
[00:37:49.871 --> 00:37:50.311]  Okay, thank you.
[00:37:50.752 --> 00:37:51.152]  You bet.
[00:37:51.192 --> 00:37:53.774]  Good to have you there as a new listener.
[00:37:53.814 --> 00:37:56.056]  Please spread the word about the show.
[00:37:56.437 --> 00:38:02.682]  You know, I know we have loaded phones, and we'll go to some of those calls here in a few minutes.
[00:38:05.304 --> 00:38:09.068]  But let me get back into the news for you.
[00:38:11.129 --> 00:38:12.831]  IMF says rise in...
[00:38:13.758 --> 00:38:14.098]  U.S.
[00:38:14.198 --> 00:38:16.399]  debts is threat to world economy.
[00:38:16.459 --> 00:38:26.644]  Now, again, this is like a mafia chief, Al Capone, saying the mafia was a problem in the 20s and 30s in Chicago.
[00:38:27.684 --> 00:38:29.805]  They run our Federal Reserve.
[00:38:29.865 --> 00:38:31.986]  They set the policy on a global scale.
[00:38:32.026 --> 00:38:39.710]  They are the private receivership arm of the big central banks of Europe and the private shareholders here in the U.S.
[00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:40.110]  as well.
[00:38:40.879 --> 00:38:42.380]  They have set up this implosion.
[00:38:42.761 --> 00:38:47.605]  Joseph Sticklitz, two years ago, quit the IMF, went public.
[00:38:48.045 --> 00:38:50.207]  Thousands of pages of documents were released.
[00:38:50.247 --> 00:38:51.969]  The IMF did not deny their validity.
[00:38:51.989 --> 00:38:53.050]  They said they were accurate.
[00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:55.132]  They were copyright and shouldn't be released.
[00:38:55.652 --> 00:39:06.902]  And the IMF described how they wanted to implode almost all the major economies in the Americas, in Asia, in Africa, drive down the currencies, and even do this to the U.S.,
[00:39:07.382 --> 00:39:14.729]  Cause riots and then use martial law under a civil emergency to set up dictatorships.
[00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:16.190]  Okay?
[00:39:16.671 --> 00:39:21.395]  And then here we are years later as it begins to happen and they're there posing as our saviors.
[00:39:22.085 --> 00:39:22.925]  We're good to go.
[00:39:22.985 --> 00:39:23.605]  We're good to go.
[00:39:51.115 --> 00:40:01.383]  Questioning the wisdom of the Bush administration's tax cuts and warning that large budget deficits pose significant risk, not just for the United States, but for the rest of the world.
[00:40:01.624 --> 00:40:05.487]  Now, this is more of this good cop, bad cop business.
[00:40:06.908 --> 00:40:16.876]  The OECD, another globalist body that's chaired by the same people that run the IMF, World Bank, UN, World Trade Organization, World Health Organization, it's just a handful of people,
[00:40:17.924 --> 00:40:20.345]  They have come out and they've called it tax havens.
[00:40:20.405 --> 00:40:30.008]  They've said that America's average tax of about 50% is not high enough, that the world average tax should be the French model of 87%.
[00:40:30.048 --> 00:40:36.249]  These are official IMF World Bank OECD documents.
[00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:41.031]  And they are pressuring all their member countries to raise taxes.
[00:40:42.678 --> 00:40:44.720]  And so they will then come into the U.S.
[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:49.765]  and say, oh, see, you're causing all these problems because you have such a big deficit because you cut taxes.
[00:40:50.125 --> 00:40:53.709]  It isn't because they cut taxes a little bit that we have the deficit.
[00:40:53.729 --> 00:41:04.119]  It's because the Federal Reserve System, that is a unit of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank System, creates a dollar of debt every time a dollar is created.
[00:41:04.519 --> 00:41:06.401]  It's designed to cause implosions.
[00:41:07.799 --> 00:41:08.439]  We're good to go.
[00:41:08.479 --> 00:41:09.160]  We're good to go.
[00:41:37.443 --> 00:41:37.923]  We're good to go.
[00:41:37.943 --> 00:41:38.164]  I think?
[00:42:04.878 --> 00:42:22.403]  And now there's a 32-year-old television producer who was admitted in hospital in the southern city on December 20th, and Chinese and international experts spent weeks testing samples before declaring that he was confirmed to have severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.
[00:42:22.543 --> 00:42:26.644]  So they're confirming that, but can you believe anything the communist Chinese say?
[00:42:27.485 --> 00:42:31.786]  And these different outbreaks are great diversions for governments, our government, their government.
[00:42:32.649 --> 00:42:34.630]  Mark, who's up first here?
[00:42:36.171 --> 00:42:37.612]  Joe in New York, you're on the air.
[00:42:37.632 --> 00:42:38.092]  Go ahead.
[00:42:38.772 --> 00:42:39.152]  Hey, Alex.
[00:42:39.172 --> 00:42:39.753]  How you doing?
[00:42:40.033 --> 00:42:40.333]  Fine.
[00:42:40.353 --> 00:42:40.693]  Go ahead.
[00:42:41.233 --> 00:42:51.258]  Over the holidays, I was watching a news station, and I heard about a hangover pill released by the FDA called RU21.
[00:42:51.278 --> 00:42:56.500]  And then I said to myself, boy, that sounds sort of familiar.
[00:42:56.761 --> 00:42:59.222]  And then I remembered the abortion pill called RU486.
[00:43:03.101 --> 00:43:07.445]  And I started thinking to myself, okay, how does that make sense logically?
[00:43:07.825 --> 00:43:08.045]  Are you 21?
[00:43:08.285 --> 00:43:12.689]  You know, as far as the hangover pill, are you 21 to drink?
[00:43:13.269 --> 00:43:15.031]  And the abortion pill, are you 486?
[00:43:15.631 --> 00:43:17.433]  And what do you do when you throw something out, Alex?
[00:43:17.933 --> 00:43:19.054]  You 86 it.
[00:43:19.875 --> 00:43:25.499]  So are you 486 is the abortion pill name.
[00:43:25.639 --> 00:43:27.461]  I thought that was kind of like a little sick.
[00:43:29.136 --> 00:43:34.280]  You know, and they spend sometimes millions of dollars.
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:40.404]  I saw a report where they spent like $5 million with three different ad agencies to come up with a name.
[00:43:41.125 --> 00:43:42.346]  I believe it was Nexium.
[00:43:42.746 --> 00:43:45.768]  A little purple pill just to come up with that term.
[00:43:45.889 --> 00:43:46.649]  I believe it was Nexium.
[00:43:46.669 --> 00:43:47.510]  That was a few years ago.
[00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:53.974]  But this is just another example, and what you're saying sounds valid.
[00:43:53.994 --> 00:43:57.157]  The globalists love to have stuff hidden in plain view.
[00:43:57.217 --> 00:44:04.302]  We know they pore over what to name something, and it sounds very valid, yes.
[00:44:04.682 --> 00:44:05.943]  I mean, how valid can it be?
[00:44:06.143 --> 00:44:08.264]  RU21 is a hangover pill.
[00:44:08.324 --> 00:44:08.945]  Makes sense to me.
[00:44:08.985 --> 00:44:12.647]  And RU486 is like, you might as well put a question mark after that.
[00:44:13.607 --> 00:44:15.088]  I did hear about that hangover pill.
[00:44:15.128 --> 00:44:17.149]  No telling what it does to your brain.
[00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:23.373]  You know, I heard the real hangover pill is drinking a couple glasses of water that evening.
[00:44:23.913 --> 00:44:26.215]  But no, we'll just take some toxic pill.
[00:44:26.615 --> 00:44:27.215]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:44:27.315 --> 00:44:28.876]  So you heard of the abortion pill, though, RU486?
[00:44:28.956 --> 00:44:29.677]  Of course.
[00:44:29.757 --> 00:44:31.458]  Yeah, it's killing a bunch of people.
[00:44:31.894 --> 00:44:33.815]  Yeah, okay, so I just wanted to make that comment.
[00:44:33.975 --> 00:44:37.597]  And when are you going to be making your videos on DVD, all of them?
[00:44:39.477 --> 00:44:44.480]  You know, we're still doing it in VHS, because despite the fact they're trying to phase out VHS,
[00:44:46.211 --> 00:44:51.013]  Still, there are three times as many VHS players in the country.
[00:44:51.833 --> 00:44:58.876]  About half my listeners don't have DVD players, and it's easier for people to make copies VHS to VHS.
[00:44:59.156 --> 00:45:02.317]  So to get the word out, I still have them in VHS.
[00:45:02.337 --> 00:45:07.979]  But I am planning in the future sometime to come out with DVDs with all the films.
[00:45:08.019 --> 00:45:11.520]  But right now, the only DVD I've got is 9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:12.621]  That makes sense.
[00:45:12.961 --> 00:45:14.002]  All right, great work, Alex.
[00:45:14.082 --> 00:45:15.024]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:45:15.184 --> 00:45:16.906]  Okay, Joe, thanks for your call.
[00:45:17.486 --> 00:45:18.467]  Who's up next now?
[00:45:20.469 --> 00:45:22.051]  Danny in Tennessee, go ahead.
[00:45:22.071 --> 00:45:25.255]  Good to talk to you, Danny.
[00:45:25.715 --> 00:45:26.136]  Hey, Alex.
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:28.180]  Love you, love your show.
[00:45:28.601 --> 00:45:31.001]  I've called you a couple times in the past.
[00:45:31.201 --> 00:45:32.082]  I used a different name.
[00:45:32.102 --> 00:45:34.923]  My real name's Robert, but Danny is my nickname.
[00:45:35.003 --> 00:45:36.903]  Okay, that's fine, sir.
[00:45:36.983 --> 00:45:38.244]  Go ahead.
[00:45:38.864 --> 00:45:41.465]  I just woke up a little while ago, but anyway... Okay, that's fine, too.
[00:45:41.505 --> 00:45:41.765]  Go ahead.
[00:45:41.785 --> 00:45:43.045]  I want to go ahead and get to the point.
[00:45:44.246 --> 00:45:47.827]  My dad had just left recently to go get a bite to eat or something.
[00:45:47.847 --> 00:45:51.628]  He was telling me before he left that... He's like, you know, did you read the newspaper today?
[00:45:51.648 --> 00:45:52.369]  I was like, no.
[00:45:52.429 --> 00:45:53.549]  And he's like, you know...
[00:45:54.215 --> 00:45:54.876]  I was like why?
[00:45:55.056 --> 00:45:59.962]  And he told me that Bush is trying to give illegal immigrants amnesty or something like that?
[00:46:00.945 --> 00:46:02.886]  Well, you've got to learn the doublespeak.
[00:46:02.926 --> 00:46:04.546]  He's reforming it.
[00:46:04.606 --> 00:46:07.547]  It's not amnesty, but anyone who's here will be legal.
[00:46:08.027 --> 00:46:11.247]  Anyone that can get here in perpetuity is legal.
[00:46:11.608 --> 00:46:16.529]  In the past, but let's go along with the lie, it's not amnesty, it's just total legalization.
[00:46:16.709 --> 00:46:17.849]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:18.129 --> 00:46:22.330]  And in the past, they would only legalize who was here.
[00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:25.011]  Five million, ten million here or there, three million here or there.
[00:46:25.391 --> 00:46:25.971]  Now it's...
[00:46:26.552 --> 00:46:27.255]  Exactly.
[00:46:27.315 --> 00:46:27.455]  Yeah.
[00:46:32.796 --> 00:46:39.321]  Well, my dad's a big fan of your show, too, and he's the one that kind of turned me on to you, and then we bought a couple of your videos and gave them out to friends and stuff.
[00:46:39.341 --> 00:46:40.702]  Well, I appreciate you doing that, my friend.
[00:46:41.082 --> 00:46:43.083]  I just wanted another comment.
[00:46:43.544 --> 00:46:45.365]  I used to work at this television show.
[00:46:45.385 --> 00:46:50.769]  I don't know if I should say the name because it might give them a bad name, but... You can say the name of anything you want, sir.
[00:46:50.829 --> 00:46:51.849]  It's called the First Amendment.
[00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.490]  Exactly.
[00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:54.351]  Well, that's what I'm about to get to.
[00:46:54.451 --> 00:46:59.155]  Okay, a friend of mine I work with, I used to roommate with him, but I moved out because he was just complete...
[00:47:00.976 --> 00:47:01.256]  I don't know.
[00:47:01.296 --> 00:47:02.658]  It's, I guess, jerk, maybe.
[00:47:02.678 --> 00:47:03.638]  Okay, fine.
[00:47:03.718 --> 00:47:04.139]  Go ahead.
[00:47:04.279 --> 00:47:06.601]  And I brought up a couple of points.
[00:47:06.621 --> 00:47:09.584]  You know, I was like, yeah, you should really listen to this guy on the radio.
[00:47:09.624 --> 00:47:19.172]  He's like, well, radio shows are blah, blah, blah, and trying to talk bad about you or something, trying to just say that you tell lies and all that.
[00:47:19.192 --> 00:47:22.154]  And I was like, you know, no, he makes complete sense to me.
[00:47:22.254 --> 00:47:24.376]  I think outside the box, you know.
[00:47:25.077 --> 00:47:27.759]  And I guess he's just brainwashed or something, but...
[00:47:29.266 --> 00:47:36.633]  I tried to tell him about Pearl Harbor and how the president knew about it like two weeks in advance, and he's like, no, they didn't know that.
[00:47:36.653 --> 00:47:39.596]  Well, that document's declassified in public now.
[00:47:39.616 --> 00:47:43.901]  Yeah, and everybody at the work thought I was crazy or some terrorist.
[00:47:43.941 --> 00:47:51.148]  They labeled me anti-American just because I believe the president's not a good person and the government can't be trusted, you know, and I thought that was...
[00:47:51.775 --> 00:47:57.019]  It made me really mad because, I mean... So I guess all the Founding Fathers are terrorists because they said don't trust the government.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:15.335]  Yeah, exactly, and I just, it makes me so mad that they label me as anti-American just because I have, you know, I speak out against what the media says, you know, as you say, the media of deception, you know, I mean, you can't really believe anything they say, and it just cracks me up because these people are just
[00:48:16.124 --> 00:48:16.244]  Yeah.
[00:48:16.264 --> 00:48:16.344]  Yeah.
[00:48:32.424 --> 00:48:37.686]  That's what makes it so complex, is that they have different propaganda for different levels of the public.
[00:48:37.886 --> 00:48:52.911]  Within the same newscast, there's multivariate, multifaceted algorithms of classical propaganda with high-tech semantical distortions that is very, very serious.
[00:48:53.471 --> 00:48:55.052]  Yeah, and just one more thing.
[00:48:55.992 --> 00:49:01.194]  My mom's a big fan of CSI, crime scene investigation, and all this.
[00:49:01.676 --> 00:49:05.638]  And on there, a couple times I've watched it with her, they actually talk about Big Brother.
[00:49:05.678 --> 00:49:09.100]  Like, you know, thanks to Big Brother, blah, blah, blah, you know.
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.921]  Oh, no, that's the thing.
[00:49:11.002 --> 00:49:15.844]  In the news, on the sitcoms, in the dramas, Big Brother's now a good thing.
[00:49:15.924 --> 00:49:19.066]  I see headlines every week that say, Big Brother helping.
[00:49:19.106 --> 00:49:20.927]  Big Brother wasn't so bad after all.
[00:49:21.047 --> 00:49:23.189]  Torture wasn't so bad after all.
[00:49:23.489 --> 00:49:24.790]  Secret arrest was good.
[00:49:25.973 --> 00:49:31.378]  Yeah, I mean, they just openly talk about Big Brother like it's the best thing in the world, you know, and I'm like, no.
[00:49:31.398 --> 00:49:36.422]  But see, now you're crazy because you don't like Big Brother.
[00:49:36.482 --> 00:49:38.184]  See, that's un-American, too.
[00:49:38.204 --> 00:49:41.787]  Yeah, well, thanks for listening to me, Alex.
[00:49:42.267 --> 00:49:42.988]  You have a nice day.
[00:49:43.008 --> 00:49:45.450]  I'm going to go ahead and let you go so you can get to your other callers, all right?
[00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:46.871]  Hey, I really appreciate your call.
[00:49:47.072 --> 00:49:48.273]  I sound a little irritated with you.
[00:49:48.293 --> 00:49:49.514]  I have a bad headache today.
[00:49:49.554 --> 00:49:50.655]  I really have headaches.
[00:49:52.092 --> 00:49:57.635]  I've got a splitting headache, so if I sound a little grumpy here, maybe it'll go away if I eat something.
[00:49:59.416 --> 00:50:05.059]  We'll come back and go to more calls, and we've got two guests coming up after that, and we'll take calls for those guests as well.
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:10.762]  I've gotten through about a half inch of the news, and this stack is about four inches thick.
[00:50:11.042 --> 00:50:13.023]  It's just giving me an idea of what's here.
[00:50:13.584 --> 00:50:15.945]  Bush will give illegal workers broad new rights.
[00:50:16.952 --> 00:50:19.133]  Blair pledges to quit, have proven a liar.
[00:50:19.153 --> 00:50:20.214]  You've already been proven a liar.
[00:50:20.874 --> 00:50:21.194]  U.S.
[00:50:21.334 --> 00:50:22.875]  looking for dirty bombs in five cities.
[00:50:22.895 --> 00:50:23.835]  I'll get to that next.
[00:50:24.916 --> 00:50:28.717]  Also, expert al-Qaeda to attack regularly in 2004.
[00:50:28.797 --> 00:50:30.318]  Lots of that on the forecast.
[00:50:30.698 --> 00:50:32.599]  When you hear al-Qaeda, that means CIA.
[00:50:33.199 --> 00:50:35.981]  Judge lifts ban on Pentagon anthrax shots.
[00:50:38.202 --> 00:50:40.423]  Devour unique Russian UFOs.
[00:50:41.949 --> 00:50:47.715]  This is a mainstream news article about the US and Russian government building a drone factory together.
[00:50:48.576 --> 00:50:50.999]  And then when folks ask what they are, they just say they're UFOs.
[00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:54.603]  Also, State Department worker found dead outside agency.
[00:50:55.043 --> 00:50:58.227]  Cannibal reveals meat man-eater network.
[00:50:58.627 --> 00:50:59.268]  It's all coming up.

[00:52:59.571 --> 00:53:07.198]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny on DVD.
[00:53:07.479 --> 00:53:08.880]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:11.262]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:53:11.423 --> 00:53:13.505]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:53:13.785 --> 00:53:18.730]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.

[00:53:50.524 --> 00:53:51.484]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:53:51.605 --> 00:53:53.246]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:20.057 --> 00:54:30.563]  You see, the advertisement pitch they're selling you is perceived massive sustained terrorist threat.
[00:54:32.765 --> 00:54:45.212]  That's why long before 9-11 they had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, probably in the thousands, of anti-terror drills, decontamination drills, nuclear spill drills.
[00:54:46.065 --> 00:54:47.547]  Attacks on school drills.
[00:54:47.787 --> 00:54:51.210]  They had those before Columbine with the Secret Service and FBI involved.
[00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:55.773]  And FEMA, by the way, that's in my film, a police state to the takeover.
[00:54:56.494 --> 00:55:04.100]  Notice FEMA has a program to stop mass shootings, and then suddenly, of course, you have the big mass shooting and then all the foul play there by the federal government.
[00:55:05.722 --> 00:55:12.187]  But it creates the perception that we're all about to be attacked by terrorists any second.
[00:55:13.567 --> 00:55:15.008]  And here's the Toronto Star.
[00:55:15.188 --> 00:55:16.069]  And again, it's admitted.
[00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:29.099]  The terror alerts to Germany, the terror alerts to France, the terror alerts to Nevada were false, and German intelligence says they believe the CIA was planting false stories for a political diversion.
[00:55:30.099 --> 00:55:41.288]  Well, FBI and CIA agents went public last year in ABC News, Associated Press, Capitol Hill, Bloomberg, the story that we've been ordered to issue fake terror alerts to, quote, create hysteria.
[00:55:42.145 --> 00:55:44.027]  I'm not saying the Globals aren't going to blow something up.
[00:55:44.367 --> 00:55:48.211]  But in between those attacks they launch, they want to keep the fear going.
[00:55:48.631 --> 00:55:59.441]  And so when they have a terror drill in many cities, like Top Off 1, Top Off 2, that were nationwide, and folks living in Denver know about this, they really did it big time in your city twice.
[00:56:00.063 --> 00:56:00.403]  I think so.
[00:56:22.182 --> 00:56:24.264]  And I've had city council folks on from Denver.
[00:56:24.284 --> 00:56:26.325]  I've had them on from Austin.
[00:56:26.365 --> 00:56:32.751]  I've interviewed people all over the country where they have these fake terror attacks that later admit, oh, it was just a drill.
[00:56:33.812 --> 00:56:35.273]  This is to create that perception.
[00:56:35.933 --> 00:56:36.073]  U.S.
[00:56:36.113 --> 00:56:38.515]  looking for dirty bomb in five cities.
[00:56:39.136 --> 00:56:41.498]  Bioweapons experts still on high alert.
[00:56:42.338 --> 00:56:43.719]  This is out of the Toronto Star.
[00:56:43.819 --> 00:56:49.223]  While huge New York Eve celebrations and college football bowl games, the U.S.
[00:56:49.243 --> 00:57:06.516]  government last month dispatched scores of casualties, excuse me, casually dressed nuclear scientists with sophisticated radiation detention equipment hidden in briefcases and golf bags to scour five major cities for radiological or dirty bombs.
[00:57:07.577 --> 00:57:10.779]  According to officials involved in the emergency effort,
[00:57:11.403 --> 00:57:23.070]  The call-up of Department of Energy radiation experts to Washington, New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and Baltimore was the first since the weeks after September 11th terror attacks.
[00:57:23.130 --> 00:57:35.118]  It was conducted in secrecy in contrast to the very public cancellation of 15 commercial flights into the United States from France, Britain, and Mexico over the holidays.
[00:57:36.019 --> 00:57:38.020]  Because, see, you have the overt...
[00:57:38.721 --> 00:57:39.402]  We're good to go.
[00:57:59.483 --> 00:58:03.525]  You're going to be instantly federalized, and don't worry, you'll get a supplemental paycheck.
[00:58:03.886 --> 00:58:04.866]  How does that sound?
[00:58:05.066 --> 00:58:06.427]  You're now secret agents.
[00:58:06.447 --> 00:58:08.869]  Here's your decoder ring, basically.
[00:58:09.149 --> 00:58:11.270]  You're in the treehouse club now.
[00:58:11.370 --> 00:58:12.090]  You're cool.
[00:58:12.391 --> 00:58:13.051]  You're in.
[00:58:13.331 --> 00:58:14.932]  You're secret agents, okay?
[00:58:15.192 --> 00:58:16.013]  Watch everyone.
[00:58:16.073 --> 00:58:19.635]  Trust no one unless they're wearing a black helmet and a black ski mask.
[00:58:20.643 --> 00:58:37.036]  I mean, that's basically what it comes down to when they drill with these special encoded ID badges of the police and folks have been given that they carry around their glove compartments and keep real quiet about so during an emergency they can get through roadblocks and be little dutiful federal slaves.
[00:58:38.597 --> 00:58:47.544]  We'll come back and go to Mike in Kentucky and then we'll get our first guest on talking about the end of the First Amendment and a lot more, so stay with me.
[00:58:51.368 --> 00:58:52.949]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:53.329 --> 00:58:59.074]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:58:59.334 --> 00:59:04.457]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:59:04.798 --> 00:59:14.124]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:59:14.444 --> 00:59:19.368]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:59:19.568 --> 00:59:20.209]  We're good to go.
[00:59:20.249 --> 00:59:20.950]  We're good to go.
[00:59:35.305 --> 00:59:44.329]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:59:44.529 --> 00:59:48.050]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:59:48.611 --> 00:59:49.711]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:59:57.774 --> 00:59:58.435]  Big Brother.
[00:59:59.075 --> 01:00:00.135]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:00.856 --> 01:00:01.976]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.617 --> 01:00:03.397]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:05.071]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:06.111 --> 01:00:09.393]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.934 --> 01:00:14.036]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.236 --> 01:00:23.262]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:24.483 --> 01:00:27.224]  We're now into the second hour of this global transmission.
[01:00:27.244 --> 01:00:29.646]  We've got a guest coming on, Brett Bursey.
[01:00:30.521 --> 01:00:39.567]  Convicted for standing in a crowd of Bush worshippers with a sign saying no blood for oil, Secret Service said arrest anyone with signs that don't agree with the president.
[01:00:39.587 --> 01:00:40.807]  This is the police admitting this.
[01:00:41.348 --> 01:00:44.270]  They arrested him and he was found guilty two days ago.
[01:00:44.290 --> 01:00:48.152]  They've been talking a lot about this because it's a very dangerous precedent.
[01:00:48.852 --> 01:00:52.435]  But I guess in Russia they had a good idea of arresting folks that didn't agree with...
[01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:55.011]  With the dictators.
[01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:56.072]  So it's a good thing.
[01:00:56.092 --> 01:00:57.453]  We do have an unelected president.
[01:00:57.753 --> 01:00:59.234]  That really is true, by the way, folks.
[01:00:59.254 --> 01:01:00.535]  The Supreme Court appointed him.
[01:01:01.175 --> 01:01:06.299]  I don't support Al Gore either, but it doesn't change the fact that that happened.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.602]  And they're setting up a dictatorship right now.
[01:01:09.642 --> 01:01:10.262]  I'm not kidding.
[01:01:11.043 --> 01:01:12.804]  Michael in Kentucky, you're on the air.
[01:01:12.844 --> 01:01:13.324]  Go ahead.
[01:01:13.444 --> 01:01:17.127]  Yeah, I heard you click me over, and I just realized I had a radio way in the background.
[01:01:17.147 --> 01:01:19.969]  I went to the other room and turned it down because I heard it started echoing.
[01:01:19.989 --> 01:01:21.430]  A lot of people don't realize that, do they?
[01:01:21.952 --> 01:01:23.554]  Okay, but what's on your mind, sir?
[01:01:23.774 --> 01:01:28.298]  Okay, you're talking about the First Amendment being in jeopardy.
[01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:31.120]  I just discovered something in our hometown.
[01:01:31.161 --> 01:01:40.049]  The local newspaper did not buy what should be their obvious webpage name for their newspaper.
[01:01:40.469 --> 01:01:44.753]  And so there's somebody else out there that has bought it and put up a message board saying,
[01:01:45.599 --> 01:01:52.403]  And I think I know who it is, but I know you can buy web pages kind of anonymously, like if you use a credit card that's not in your name or whatever.
[01:01:52.443 --> 01:02:14.635]  So that's causing some trouble around here, and I think that's probably a good idea if people just use their heads a little bit and then go search to see, like our newspapers trying to act, I guess, a little bit big for its britches, and they have a web page that implies that they're bigger, and they print newspapers for other towns and stuff.
[01:02:15.836 --> 01:02:30.855]  So the local webpage is called moreheadnews.com, and it's not associated with the newspaper at all, and it's a pretty neat open forum for people to talk about local stuff that the
[01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:31.830]  I think so.
[01:02:54.679 --> 01:02:55.800]  There's lots of jokes about it.
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:59.263]  Well, you can't copyright the word milk either.
[01:02:59.763 --> 01:03:05.988]  You can't copyright the word Austin or Detroit or Michigan for that matter, though they've been trying.
[01:03:06.048 --> 01:03:07.589]  But, yeah, that's a creative thing.
[01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:12.713]  If there's a newspaper you don't like in your area, get a name very similar to it.
[01:03:13.073 --> 01:03:16.796]  Put up your own newspaper where you just put your comments, your own blog.
[01:03:17.316 --> 01:03:24.339]  Your own weekly or daily info, put a message board up, and it will drive the local constabulary nuts.
[01:03:24.619 --> 01:03:29.922]  They can't stand the little people being able to interact other than in their system.
[01:03:30.062 --> 01:03:41.267]  Well, another thing that I just realized, because I found out now, the government has huge storage capacity in computer mediums.
[01:03:41.427 --> 01:03:45.989]  I mean, back when before the CD-ROM came out, they were using LaserDisc ROMs.
[01:03:46.636 --> 01:03:47.277]  We're good to go.
[01:04:09.394 --> 01:04:11.335]  No telling what's really going on.
[01:04:11.395 --> 01:04:12.115]  Thanks for the call.
[01:04:12.135 --> 01:04:12.636]  I appreciate it.
[01:04:12.656 --> 01:04:14.557]  We're going to come back and go to our guest.
[01:04:40.319 --> 01:04:42.284]  And believe me, you want to hear about this.
[01:04:43.005 --> 01:04:45.290]  This is a big, big deal for America.
[01:04:45.972 --> 01:04:49.720]  It is totally un-American what these courts are doing.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:50.582]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:53.336 --> 01:04:53.816]  We're good to go.
[01:04:53.836 --> 01:04:54.157]  I think?
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:17.521]  Good health is achievable when you tune into Achieving Great Health.
[01:05:17.541 --> 01:05:22.984]  If you want to learn more on how to naturally rid the body of any disease, listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley.
[01:05:39.332 --> 01:05:43.414]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:43.494 --> 01:05:48.157]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:05:48.177 --> 01:05:51.678]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:05:51.718 --> 01:05:53.339]  The New World Order.
[01:06:08.687 --> 01:06:09.689]  Can emerge.
[01:06:09.709 --> 01:06:13.936]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:13.996 --> 01:06:20.927]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:21.068 --> 01:06:23.051]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:23.447 --> 01:06:33.772]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:34.053 --> 01:06:39.395]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:06:39.936 --> 01:06:42.557]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:06:42.697 --> 01:06:43.858]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:06:43.878 --> 01:06:44.318]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:06:44.338 --> 01:06:46.139]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:06:52.762 --> 01:07:03.487]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:07:03.667 --> 01:07:11.231]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:07:11.471 --> 01:07:20.682]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable level, and it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:07:20.943 --> 01:07:27.090]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:07:27.450 --> 01:07:31.333]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:07:31.393 --> 01:07:33.274]  The water level is always visible.
[01:07:33.475 --> 01:07:39.399]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:43.582]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:07:43.602 --> 01:07:44.282]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:07:44.322 --> 01:07:45.643]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:56.827 --> 01:07:59.848]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:02.048 --> 01:08:07.830]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2, back from 9 to midnight, we do this show live, folks.
[01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:12.591]  The websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:08:13.732 --> 01:08:18.433]  Coming up, after some calls, we're going to have Brett Bursey on the show.
[01:08:20.233 --> 01:08:25.855]  And I interviewed a conservative writer, James Bovard, on Monday.
[01:08:27.443 --> 01:08:32.461]  Excuse me, on Tuesday, covering this issue, and then later that day, the federal court ruled...
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:37.381]  Quarantining dissent, how the Secret Service protects Bush from free speech.
[01:08:37.481 --> 01:08:38.882]  James Bovard wrote this article.
[01:08:39.362 --> 01:08:51.386]  When President Bush travels around the United States, the Secret Service visits the location ahead of time and orders local police to set up free speech zones or protest where people opposed to Bush policies are quarantined.
[01:08:51.426 --> 01:08:57.628]  These zones routinely succeed in keeping protesters out of presidential sight and around the view.
[01:08:58.488 --> 01:09:14.533]  Outside the view of media covering the event, when Bush went to Pittsburgh area in Labor Day 2002, 65-year-old retired steel worker Bill Neal was there to greet him with a sign proclaiming, The Bush family must surely love the poor they made so many of us.
[01:09:15.173 --> 01:09:25.576]  The local police at the Secret Service's behest set up a designated free speech zone on a baseball field surrounded by a chain-link fence a third of a mile from the location of Bush's speech.
[01:09:26.576 --> 01:09:26.896]  The Bush...
[01:09:27.751 --> 01:09:28.552]  Oh yes, very American.
[01:09:51.684 --> 01:09:55.746]  Neil later commented, as far as I'm concerned, the whole country is a free speech zone.
[01:09:55.786 --> 01:10:00.708]  If the Bush administration has its way, anyone who criticizes them will be out of sight and out of mind.
[01:10:01.449 --> 01:10:13.294]  At Neil's trial, police detective John Inachone testified that the Secret Service told local police to confine people that were making a statement pretty much against the president and his views.
[01:10:13.595 --> 01:10:16.436]  That's a quote in a so-called free speech area.
[01:10:17.088 --> 01:10:35.653]  Paul Wolf, one of the top officials in the county police department, told Salon that the Secret Service had come in and do a site survey and say, quote, here's a place where the people can be and we'd like to have any protesters put in a place that is able to be secured.
[01:10:36.333 --> 01:10:38.434]  Basically in a little prison with a fence around you.
[01:10:38.894 --> 01:10:41.014]  Some cases they put them in warehouses, folks.
[01:10:41.274 --> 01:10:43.355]  You can protest in a warehouse a mile away.
[01:10:44.099 --> 01:10:52.112]  Pennsylvania District Judge Shirley Rove, Trucula, threw out the disorderly conduct charge against Neil Darling.
[01:10:55.496 --> 01:10:57.157]  I believe this is America.
[01:10:57.657 --> 01:11:04.279]  Whatever happened to I don't agree with you, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it, the judge said.
[01:11:04.779 --> 01:11:08.641]  Similar suppressions have occurred during Bush's visits to Florida.
[01:11:08.961 --> 01:11:09.601]  A recent St.
[01:11:09.661 --> 01:11:24.086]  Petersburg Times editorial noted that a Bush rally at the Legends Field in 2001, three demonstrators, two of whom were grandmothers, were arrested for holding up small handwritten protest signs outside the designated zones.
[01:11:24.858 --> 01:11:31.202]  At last year, seven protesters were arrested when Bush came to a rally at the USF Sun Dome.
[01:11:31.562 --> 01:11:37.065]  They had refused to be cordoned off into a protest zone hundreds of yards from the entrance of the dome.
[01:11:37.805 --> 01:11:45.109]  One of the arrested protesters was a 62-year-old man holding up a sign, War is good for business, invest your sons.
[01:11:45.690 --> 01:11:50.532]  The seven were charged with trespassing, obstructing without violence and disorderly conduct.
[01:11:51.973 --> 01:11:53.514]  Now folks, why do they do this?
[01:11:55.658 --> 01:12:04.123]  Bush lost, the state lost a bunch of lawsuits, three separate class action suits of groups that sued back in 98 here in Texas.
[01:12:04.143 --> 01:12:06.485]  And I've talked about this, but it's a big deal, folks.
[01:12:07.385 --> 01:12:08.166]  Why do they do this?
[01:12:08.766 --> 01:12:12.688]  Well, you notice whenever you see Bush go anywhere, you just see cheering people.
[01:12:13.549 --> 01:12:20.253]  And you see that because they arrest people who will try to stand in a crowd on a public street worshiping Bush.
[01:12:20.613 --> 01:12:23.575]  They can do it, but if you are against Bush, you can't.
[01:12:25.143 --> 01:12:28.446]  Police have repressed protesters during several Bush visits to St.
[01:12:28.487 --> 01:12:29.387]  Louis area as well.
[01:12:29.427 --> 01:12:38.677]  When Bush visited January 22nd, 150 people carrying signs were shunted far away from the main action and effectively quarantined.
[01:12:39.682 --> 01:12:45.810]  Denise Lieberman of the American Civil Liberties Union of Eastern Missouri commented no one could see them from the street.
[01:12:45.850 --> 01:12:48.433]  In addition, the media were not allowed to talk to them.
[01:12:48.793 --> 01:12:56.743]  The police would not allow any media inside the protest area and wouldn't allow any of the protesters out of the protest zone to talk to the media.
[01:12:57.509 --> 01:13:07.556]  When Bush stopped by at a Boeing plant to talk to workers, it says Christina Maines and her five-year-old daughter disobeyed orders to move to a small protest area.
[01:13:07.896 --> 01:13:17.383]  Far from the action, police arrested Maines and took her and her crying daughter away in separate squad cars to Justice Department.
[01:13:18.083 --> 01:13:21.506]  Again, the Justice Department is now prosecuting Brett Bursey.
[01:13:22.754 --> 01:13:23.214]  We're good to go.
[01:13:48.977 --> 01:13:49.397]  Thank you.
[01:13:49.497 --> 01:13:49.857]  Thank you.
[01:14:07.978 --> 01:14:09.560]  Berzy was charged with trespassing.
[01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:16.327]  Five months later, the charge was dropped because of South Carolina law prohibits arresting people for trespassing on public property.
[01:14:16.907 --> 01:14:19.530]  But the Justice Department, in the person of U.S.
[01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:25.096]  Attorney Strom Thurmond Jr., quickly jumped in, charging Berzy.
[01:14:26.142 --> 01:14:33.544]  With violating a rarely enforced federal law regarding entering a restricted area around the President of the United States.
[01:14:34.045 --> 01:14:39.966]  If convicted, Bursey faces a six-month trip up the river and a $5,000 fine.
[01:14:40.046 --> 01:14:45.868]  Federal Magistrate Bristow Marchett denied Bursey's request for a jury trial.
[01:14:45.888 --> 01:14:47.949]  Oh!
[01:14:48.529 --> 01:14:49.949]  Another little caveat.
[01:14:49.969 --> 01:14:51.030]  I thought we got those.
[01:14:51.610 --> 01:14:54.591]  Because his violation is categorized as a petty offense.
[01:14:55.410 --> 01:14:56.611]  I love this stuff.
[01:14:56.812 --> 01:14:59.234]  They got laws all over the country where they take your house.
[01:14:59.614 --> 01:15:02.157]  If you leave town, your 20-year-old son has a beer party.
[01:15:02.818 --> 01:15:14.810]  They got several cities in New Mexico do this, and then they come in and take your house, and you can't have a trial because, well, it's a city ordinance, but the ordinance says they take your house, but you don't get a trial.
[01:15:15.330 --> 01:15:18.694]  Some observers believe that the feds are seeking to set a precedent...
[01:15:19.326 --> 01:15:26.432]  In a conservative state, you mean a neocon area, such as South Carolina, that could then be used against protesters nationwide.
[01:15:29.235 --> 01:15:31.497]  So understand, folks, you don't get a jury trial.
[01:15:31.557 --> 01:15:35.480]  He was facing six months in federal prison and a $5,000 fine.
[01:15:36.561 --> 01:15:40.044]  Bonnie, the Constitution says, what, if the offense is above $20...
[01:15:41.969 --> 01:15:49.454]  You get a jury trial, but the feds, the judges say, no, no, six months in federal prison and a $5,000 fine.
[01:15:50.795 --> 01:15:51.555]  That's petty.
[01:15:52.156 --> 01:15:53.237]  You don't get a trial.
[01:15:54.598 --> 01:15:55.358]  You starting to get it?
[01:15:55.698 --> 01:16:02.863]  Oh, we take your house, but you can't have a trial because you can't have a jury trial because it's a city ordinance.
[01:16:03.043 --> 01:16:11.549]  Oh, we're fining you $2,000 a day for having three-inch grass in your yard as they do all over the country with federal zoning that's been passed locally.
[01:16:12.651 --> 01:16:15.392]  Federally packaged and pushed stuff that's been passed locally.
[01:16:15.992 --> 01:16:19.233]  And I've done dozens of stories, dozens and dozens here on this show.
[01:16:19.253 --> 01:16:23.434]  Just in Austin, I've done several TV shows about it where you go out and show three-inch grass.
[01:16:23.474 --> 01:16:24.614]  It's always some old person.
[01:16:24.634 --> 01:16:30.555]  They've got a database at one of the hospitals we know of where they kind of send a letter off to the IRS or the local city.
[01:16:30.856 --> 01:16:32.556]  Hey, this old person just had a heart attack.
[01:16:33.226 --> 01:16:34.007]  We're good to go.
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:58.424]  One guy, Roland Ellingston, in two weeks had $14,000-plus.
[01:16:58.704 --> 01:17:00.705]  They were preparing to take his home.
[01:17:00.765 --> 01:17:02.086]  He went on my TV show.
[01:17:02.406 --> 01:17:06.870]  The next day, a SWAT team came, knocked on the door, arrested him, and said he was drunk.
[01:17:07.410 --> 01:17:11.153]  They knock on your door, you come to the door, they arrest you and take you to jail.
[01:17:11.233 --> 01:17:11.954]  That's the freedom.
[01:17:11.974 --> 01:17:15.036]  And we have all that on video that we've aired many times.
[01:17:16.095 --> 01:17:16.715]  We're good to go.
[01:17:16.735 --> 01:17:17.476]  I think?
[01:17:44.492 --> 01:17:46.693]  And there was the blue tarp on the roof.
[01:17:47.793 --> 01:17:55.776]  There were, I'm not kidding, four or five foot tall weeds in a neighborhood with manicured lawns, fountains in the front yards, you name it.
[01:17:56.176 --> 01:18:03.278]  I put that on TV and said, Jackie Goodman, you don't let the city council take this old World War II vet's house.
[01:18:05.579 --> 01:18:06.559]  And guess what happened?
[01:18:07.359 --> 01:18:09.100]  They backed off and dropped the charges.
[01:18:10.316 --> 01:18:12.177]  By the way, he lived on a corner lot.
[01:18:12.338 --> 01:18:21.304]  He had two houses front to back he built on a corner lot with houses that are going for $400,000 apiece.
[01:18:23.246 --> 01:18:24.486]  A corner lot.
[01:18:24.546 --> 01:18:25.187]  What is it on?
[01:18:25.327 --> 01:18:26.768]  West 37th Street.
[01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:33.313]  And you notice I go from talking about getting rid of free speech, and then I migrate...
[01:18:34.108 --> 01:18:36.510]  Over into just this little tidbit.
[01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:53.223]  See, when I read an article, I understand the full system of what they're doing, so I see these little tidbits of, oh, you don't get a trial, you're just facing six months in prison and a $5,000 fine because you stood amongst a bunch of people with pro-Bush signs on a public street.
[01:18:53.624 --> 01:18:55.065]  Yours said no blood for oil.
[01:18:55.729 --> 01:19:00.752]  So you don't get a jury trial because it's a petty offense.
[01:19:01.272 --> 01:19:05.874]  Oh, we're taking your house, but you can't have a jury trial because it's a petty offense.
[01:19:06.855 --> 01:19:14.578]  And if we didn't have our little cable access show, which they're shutting down all over the country too, we couldn't have shown that city council member and the hypocrisy.
[01:19:14.838 --> 01:19:17.880]  I also went to government buildings and showed foot-tall grass and...
[01:19:18.604 --> 01:19:22.787]  And trash on the ground, and then I went to his house and showed nothing on the ground.
[01:19:23.047 --> 01:19:23.808]  He'd done nothing.
[01:19:24.008 --> 01:19:31.654]  He had three-inch grass and English ivy, which they demanded he cut on his private property.
[01:19:31.994 --> 01:19:35.436]  They wanted a house, two houses.
[01:19:35.817 --> 01:19:40.120]  Again, houses were selling down even more, $400,000 apiece on that street.
[01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:41.521]  He had two of them.
[01:19:42.342 --> 01:19:44.745]  They wanted his house because they're filled.
[01:19:53.502 --> 01:19:57.104]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[01:19:57.424 --> 01:20:00.946]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[01:20:01.226 --> 01:20:10.071]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial specialists with decades of financial experience who are ready to provide you with state-of-the-art, up-to-date financial services.
[01:20:10.411 --> 01:20:14.353]  Midas Resources offers a host of services and stands behind their products.
[01:20:14.654 --> 01:20:18.876]  In fact, if you call and order their free Midas Report, Midas Resources will pay you.
[01:20:19.505 --> 01:20:20.426]  We're good to go.
[01:20:53.413 --> 01:20:53.833]  Gold.
[01:20:54.193 --> 01:20:55.474]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:20:55.734 --> 01:21:01.816]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:21:01.996 --> 01:21:05.837]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:21:06.177 --> 01:21:08.078]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:21:08.118 --> 01:21:08.298]  Mint,
[01:21:08.658 --> 01:21:10.399]  Demand is at an all-time high.
[01:21:10.539 --> 01:21:18.284]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[01:21:18.644 --> 01:21:27.550]  Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and your family from the Fed's plans for your hard-earned money.
[01:21:27.710 --> 01:21:28.831]  Don't gamble with your future.
[01:21:28.991 --> 01:21:32.093]  Call Midas Resources today and ask for your free copy of
[01:21:32.313 --> 01:21:32.933]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[01:21:52.748 --> 01:21:59.012]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:21:59.133 --> 01:22:05.297]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:22:05.597 --> 01:22:14.023]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:22:14.283 --> 01:22:21.268]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:22:21.604 --> 01:22:22.264]  We're good to go.
[01:22:52.290 --> 01:22:54.712]  You hear a lot about the quality of air outside these days.
[01:22:54.812 --> 01:22:55.312]  Pollution.
[01:22:55.332 --> 01:22:55.613]  Pollen.
[01:22:55.673 --> 01:22:56.794]  Is it as healthy as you'd like it?
[01:22:56.854 --> 01:22:57.234]  Allergies.
[01:22:57.394 --> 01:22:57.674]  Asthma.
[01:22:57.714 --> 01:22:58.295]  Probably not.
[01:22:58.435 --> 01:22:59.155]  Well, listen to this.
[01:22:59.396 --> 01:23:08.362]  Did you know, according to the American Lung Association, combined with the EPA, the air quality inside your home is actually six to ten times worse than the air outside?
[01:23:08.443 --> 01:23:09.283]  Six to ten times?
[01:23:09.303 --> 01:23:10.364]  How could that be, you ask?
[01:23:10.444 --> 01:23:10.704]  Worse.
[01:23:10.804 --> 01:23:12.105]  Think about what's inside your home.
[01:23:12.305 --> 01:23:12.946]  Hairspray.
[01:23:13.066 --> 01:23:13.566]  Chemicals.
[01:23:13.867 --> 01:23:14.587]  Does anyone smoke?
[01:23:14.607 --> 01:23:14.807]  Fumes.
[01:23:14.988 --> 01:23:16.609]  What about all those cleaners under your sink?
[01:23:17.109 --> 01:23:18.690]  Where do you think all those fumes go?
[01:23:18.750 --> 01:23:19.450]  Toxic fumes.
[01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:20.870]  Well, I'll tell you where they go.
[01:23:20.890 --> 01:23:23.911]  They go into you, into your children.
[01:23:23.951 --> 01:23:24.511]  Their lungs.
[01:23:24.591 --> 01:23:25.372]  Am I scaring you?
[01:23:25.692 --> 01:23:26.592]  Remember this word.
[01:23:26.992 --> 01:23:27.732]  Puritec.
[01:23:27.772 --> 01:23:29.293]  P-U-R-I-T-E-C.
[01:23:29.353 --> 01:23:31.534]  Puritec makes the pure ear system.
[01:23:31.714 --> 01:23:44.238]  What this ear cleaning system does is remove dangerous airborne particles like smoke, odors, VOCs, allergens, fine dust, mold, pollen, and kills bacteria for less than half the cost of other ear purifiers, which do a lot less.
[01:23:44.338 --> 01:23:45.538]  Call them now to breathe easier.
[01:23:45.858 --> 01:23:58.545]  You know, I was just told that Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are down right now because we...
[01:24:15.529 --> 01:24:24.153]  We've already overdone our month of bandwidth on our huge servers for the month of January, so we're having to expand right now.
[01:24:24.173 --> 01:24:28.195]  And last hour, I didn't even plug my videos or books.
[01:24:28.235 --> 01:24:29.796]  That's how you support us.
[01:24:30.876 --> 01:24:38.620]  It's expensive to have eight-plus million people, individual folks, visiting our websites each month, and that's growing.
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:43.882]  We try to put free video clips up there and audio files and
[01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:52.184]  Everything else, I hope folks will support us or we'll have to restrict how many audio and video files we have or something.
[01:24:52.884 --> 01:24:56.446]  So go to InfoWars.com and buy some of the videos and books.
[01:24:56.746 --> 01:24:58.027]  It's great stuff to begin with.
[01:24:58.287 --> 01:25:00.668]  I tell you to make copies of my videos and spread the word.
[01:25:00.688 --> 01:25:02.729]  I don't know what more you need.
[01:25:03.309 --> 01:25:04.850]  We need your support, though, folks.
[01:25:05.711 --> 01:25:08.512]  Let's... Growing pains.
[01:25:09.332 --> 01:25:11.593]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:25:11.693 --> 01:25:14.574]  Brock in Canada, then Joe in Illinois and others.
[01:25:14.614 --> 01:25:15.354]  Go ahead, Brock.
[01:25:16.115 --> 01:25:16.735]  Hello, Alex.
[01:25:17.475 --> 01:25:22.157]  I wanted to mention about the circumvention of the First Amendment.
[01:25:22.777 --> 01:25:37.263]  If you're a life insurance firm, I understand that you can't mention that homosexuals, the average age is 37, because that's politically incorrect.
[01:25:37.583 --> 01:25:38.564]  Well, yeah, they can...
[01:25:40.063 --> 01:25:40.383]  I think so.
[01:26:05.276 --> 01:26:09.639]  Yeah, that's another attack of the First Amendment, I suppose, that
[01:26:35.221 --> 01:26:38.504]  Oh, but insurance companies aren't bold enough to do that.
[01:26:39.365 --> 01:26:45.330]  No, and the other thing I was going to ask is, does the mad cow scare a big scam?
[01:26:47.572 --> 01:26:48.253]  Well, no.
[01:26:48.433 --> 01:26:48.693]  I mean...
[01:26:50.208 --> 01:26:50.809]  We're good to go.
[01:27:16.673 --> 01:27:26.325]  It's low on the scale, but it is a problem, and they can just stop feeding the cows rotten meat and meat, period, and it'll go away.
[01:27:26.345 --> 01:27:27.687]  So why don't they?
[01:27:28.929 --> 01:27:29.929]  They're not going to stop that.
[01:27:29.970 --> 01:27:34.191]  They're just going to regulate all the farms and ranches more and bring in federal control.
[01:27:34.551 --> 01:27:40.473]  And so that's why they're deciding now to announce that Mad Cow is real when they've been covering it up for decades.
[01:27:40.734 --> 01:27:42.414]  Now they've got the implantable chips ready.
[01:27:42.434 --> 01:27:43.635]  They're saying that's going to be the law.
[01:27:44.115 --> 01:27:52.138]  Now they've got the Homeland Security Infrastructure Protection Act in, which already announced before the Mad Cow announcement they were going to track all the food production.
[01:27:52.825 --> 01:27:54.366]  How soon do you see this happening within two years?
[01:28:17.691 --> 01:28:31.334]  It's all, most of it's already happening and being put in place, and yeah, within a year, all the cows are going to have to have microchips in them, RFID, the FDA and agriculture are already doing that.
[01:28:31.754 --> 01:28:32.875]  It's all coming down right now.
[01:28:33.435 --> 01:28:36.516]  And when do you think the end of the First Amendment's here?
[01:28:37.316 --> 01:28:38.196]  It's been eroded.
[01:28:39.712 --> 01:28:44.695]  Well, in Canada, they'll arrest you if you say you don't like the government in many cases.
[01:28:44.715 --> 01:28:47.617]  They'll say it's code word for anti-Semitism.
[01:28:48.317 --> 01:28:50.639]  Your customs doesn't let a lot of stuff in.
[01:28:50.659 --> 01:28:53.260]  I mean, I think a pocket constitution would scare them.
[01:28:53.621 --> 01:29:04.207]  Down here, they're trying to pass hate speech and thought crime laws and just trying to use political correctness or peer pressure to make people not engage in free speech.
[01:29:04.287 --> 01:29:06.469]  But this is the end of the First Amendment.
[01:29:06.969 --> 01:29:08.210]  They found this guy guilty.
[01:29:09.217 --> 01:29:13.958]  Who was standing in a crowd of Bush supporters on a public street with a sign that said, no blood for oil.
[01:29:13.998 --> 01:29:14.918]  And the cops told him.
[01:29:15.439 --> 01:29:19.880]  And the cops have testified that, yeah, the Secret Service said no signs that don't like Bush on the street.
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:22.460]  So that's the end of the First Amendment right there, buddy.
[01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:23.941]  Yeah, it's terrible.
[01:29:24.241 --> 01:29:30.402]  I just think that the world's got to rise up and really hammer these yahoos for doing this.
[01:29:30.802 --> 01:29:34.123]  The founding fathers, when they put the First Amendment together...
[01:29:35.023 --> 01:29:40.151]  That's it, my friend.
[01:29:40.231 --> 01:29:41.913]  Great points.
[01:29:43.736 --> 01:29:44.617]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.138 --> 01:29:46.720]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.662 --> 01:29:50.346]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:53.912 --> 01:29:56.815]  We've all heard the ads for lower prices on airfare and hotel.
[01:29:56.835 --> 01:29:58.817]  Oh yeah, the dot-coms are endless.
[01:29:58.997 --> 01:30:04.643]  CheaperHotels.com, SaveOnYourRentalCar.com, HalfPriceAirlineTickets.com.
[01:30:04.703 --> 01:30:10.489]  Problem is, by the time you get done planning your vacation, you've visited dozens of websites and spent hours and hours trying to save money.
[01:30:10.629 --> 01:30:13.050]  Well, I'm glad to tell you there's an easier way to get it all at once.
[01:30:13.651 --> 01:30:26.058]  www.vacationa2z.com A membership in vacationa2z.com will not only land you huge savings on air and hotel, you'll be treated to discounts of 10-80% on car rentals, golf, movies and theme parks.
[01:30:26.258 --> 01:30:30.541]  How about free food at restaurants or big discounts on ski packages at top ski resorts?
[01:30:30.761 --> 01:30:31.482]  Not convinced yet?
[01:30:31.602 --> 01:30:35.304]  How about auto repair, health and beauty, financial services or shopping discounts?
[01:30:35.404 --> 01:30:41.686]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds...
[01:31:02.981 --> 01:31:06.864]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:31:28.257 --> 01:31:28.697]  We're good to go.
[01:31:28.717 --> 01:31:29.258]  We're good to go.
[01:31:52.262 --> 01:31:55.624]  Pharmaceutical companies, doctors, and hospitals all make money from sick people.
[01:31:55.884 --> 01:31:57.905]  So what incentive is there for them to make you well?
[01:31:58.245 --> 01:32:03.847]  For thousands of years, man has used spices and herbs to ward off disease and cure, yes, cure illness.
[01:32:04.107 --> 01:32:07.309]  It's no wonder the drug manufacturers feel threatened by spices and herbs.
[01:32:07.689 --> 01:32:12.511]  The North American Herb and Spice Company manufactures the products that Dr. Cass Ingram has been recommending for years.
[01:32:12.751 --> 01:32:16.393]  The Oregosin, Oreganol, and Oregomax are working wonders for people all over the country.
[01:32:16.613 --> 01:32:18.015]  And can work wonders for you, too.
[01:32:18.435 --> 01:32:25.162]  According to the Quarterly Review of Biology published by the University of Chicago, spices like oregano can have a 100% kill rate of bacteria.
[01:32:25.463 --> 01:32:29.167]  Protect yourself and your family with the oregano products recommended by Dr. Cass Ingram.
[01:32:29.387 --> 01:32:31.830]  Call 877-817-9829 and order your Oregosyn Oregano and Oregomax today.
[01:32:34.893 --> 01:32:35.734]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:32:35.754 --> 01:32:36.875]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:02.478 --> 01:33:04.740]  I hope everybody understands what's happening.
[01:33:07.002 --> 01:33:12.406]  Bill Clinton tried having protesters arrested, harassed by the Secret Service.
[01:33:12.526 --> 01:33:13.546]  They'll do whatever they're told.
[01:33:14.928 --> 01:33:17.610]  They had folks detained in many cases.
[01:33:17.770 --> 01:33:21.372]  But the courts would say, no, Bill Clinton, you can't do that.
[01:33:22.313 --> 01:33:24.635]  And the Rush Limbaugh's of the world would decry it.
[01:33:25.478 --> 01:33:32.983]  But Bush systematically, openly has the Secret Service do it, and now city and county and state governments are trying it.
[01:33:33.864 --> 01:33:44.991]  This is a trend to set up three speech zones a half mile, a mile away in a warehouse, and then the people that support government are all surrounding the emperor with their signs.
[01:33:46.993 --> 01:33:48.514]  That's ridiculous, folks.
[01:33:48.634 --> 01:33:50.175]  That is totally un-American.
[01:33:50.535 --> 01:33:52.797]  I don't have words to describe how bad this is.
[01:33:54.807 --> 01:34:00.151]  But yesterday I got into the human cloning.
[01:34:00.511 --> 01:34:06.476]  And the day before that we had a guest on, a doctor from one of the big bioethics organizations going over this.
[01:34:06.516 --> 01:34:18.065]  And we read the Associated Press and we read the different news articles about it where they have legalized in New Jersey cloning a human being up to birth
[01:34:18.681 --> 01:34:26.048]  Keeping the humanoid, or human depending on how you view them, alive and using them for body parts after birth.
[01:34:28.610 --> 01:34:31.073]  I don't have words to describe how horrible that is.
[01:34:31.733 --> 01:34:32.754]  That's so wicked.
[01:34:33.135 --> 01:34:34.916]  That destroys all human dignity.
[01:34:34.976 --> 01:34:38.680]  That is something out of a late night science fiction horror movie.
[01:34:40.655 --> 01:34:44.919]  But they're doing it right out in plain view, and the average person could care less.
[01:34:44.959 --> 01:34:46.540]  They don't even realize what that is.
[01:34:46.941 --> 01:34:49.563]  They can't even consciously get it through their mind.
[01:34:49.964 --> 01:35:04.817]  Taking the human form, a human body grown, taking it past birth, keeping it alive, using it for parts, growing other organs inside of it, the industrialization of this,
[01:35:05.553 --> 01:35:09.276]  New Jersey passed the law on Monday.
[01:35:09.576 --> 01:35:27.688]  The law says you can pay a woman to have a surrogate clone in her, bring it to term, and then private industry can keep the baby alive and grow it up to whatever size they want, and then it has no rights, and they can use it for experimentation or body parts.
[01:35:29.709 --> 01:35:31.450]  And that they can make money off of it.
[01:35:32.506 --> 01:35:33.806]  It actually says that.
[01:35:34.026 --> 01:35:36.107]  We posted those articles on Monday and Tuesday.
[01:35:36.127 --> 01:35:43.049]  I think about six or seven different articles, mainstream articles, quoting the bill that New Jersey passed.
[01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:46.049]  I mean, listeners, do you have any comments on this?
[01:35:46.069 --> 01:35:46.129]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:35:46.149 --> 01:35:46.369]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:35:46.489 --> 01:35:52.371]  Maybe you have the words to describe how horrible this is, or maybe you think it's a good thing, you know?
[01:36:02.785 --> 01:36:04.267]  You think abortion's wonderful.
[01:36:04.327 --> 01:36:06.789]  You think all the other stuff's a fabulous thing.
[01:36:08.591 --> 01:36:10.193]  You talk about pure blasphemy.
[01:36:10.653 --> 01:36:12.074]  You talk about total wickedness.
[01:36:12.094 --> 01:36:13.376]  You talk about nightmares.
[01:36:14.417 --> 01:36:14.997]  This is it.
[01:36:15.077 --> 01:36:26.529]  Before we go to Robert and John and others that are patiently holding, and we do have the international forecaster joining us in the third hour.
[01:36:27.594 --> 01:36:27.954]  We're good to go.
[01:36:27.974 --> 01:36:28.354]  We're good to go.
[01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:51.221]  Admittedly, for protesting.
[01:36:51.241 --> 01:36:56.183]  The judge says, yeah, you can't protest the president with folks that support him on a public street.
[01:36:57.463 --> 01:37:00.884]  Brett Bernsie was real paranoid when we talked to him yesterday.
[01:37:01.245 --> 01:37:02.485]  Well, this is talk radio.
[01:37:02.605 --> 01:37:05.306]  Am I going to get ambushed on the show?
[01:37:05.406 --> 01:37:06.346]  No, sir, you're not.
[01:37:06.406 --> 01:37:07.767]  Go to the websites, look at them.
[01:37:08.636 --> 01:37:09.837]  And we've been calling and calling.
[01:37:09.857 --> 01:37:10.578]  His phone's busy.
[01:37:11.098 --> 01:37:13.601]  You know, he may have the wrong time zone.
[01:37:13.621 --> 01:37:18.605]  That happens sometimes when a guest doesn't show up, which is quite rare for this show.
[01:37:19.066 --> 01:37:27.754]  But we'll be getting Brett Bersey on because I want this guy to find out that there are people on talk radio that support anybody's free speech.
[01:37:28.074 --> 01:37:30.576]  I happen to agree with his free speech against the war, by the way.
[01:37:30.977 --> 01:37:33.259]  But if I disagreed with it, I would support him.
[01:37:35.777 --> 01:37:42.561]  But before we go to your calls, folks, I guess for the first time this hour, I really should plug my videos.
[01:37:42.862 --> 01:37:44.383]  But there's something else I never plug.
[01:37:44.523 --> 01:37:47.605]  Infowars.net is an Internet portal.
[01:37:48.305 --> 01:37:50.146]  It's a nationwide Internet service.
[01:37:50.927 --> 01:38:03.515]  Croxy servers and the browser, the cloaking device, so it blocks cookies and people don't know who you are as you're surfing around the Internet.
[01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:05.040]  Oh, I forget.
[01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:06.721]  It's got all the services there.
[01:38:06.781 --> 01:38:08.021]  What's the term for that, Mark?
[01:38:10.341 --> 01:38:12.102]  It's not a proxy browser.
[01:38:15.703 --> 01:38:20.864]  What's that call where you have the browser that's at another server so it blocks your identity?
[01:38:22.444 --> 01:38:24.505]  Yeah, anonymous surfing, but there's another term for it.
[01:38:24.965 --> 01:38:25.465]  Exactly.
[01:38:25.525 --> 01:38:26.985]  I mean, that comes standard with it.
[01:38:27.306 --> 01:38:29.066]  I don't run it either because I'm not technical.
[01:38:29.794 --> 01:38:30.855]  We're good to go.
[01:38:30.915 --> 01:38:31.235]  I think?
[01:38:50.404 --> 01:38:51.245]  We're good to go.
[01:39:18.041 --> 01:39:19.923]  I'm in it with a whole server farm.
[01:39:20.423 --> 01:39:22.526]  This gets very, very expensive.
[01:39:22.926 --> 01:39:33.516]  Not just when you have 8 million individual visitors to my two big websites a month, but also the audio files, the video files, all the sites that are linking to us.
[01:39:34.538 --> 01:39:39.583]  We really need you folks to go sign up at InfoWars.net.
[01:39:41.215 --> 01:39:48.059]  Why you would be with AOL or others who have horrible service, who track and trace you, who sell your info.
[01:39:48.159 --> 01:39:49.199]  We don't do that.
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:53.722]  And there's so many great services at Infowars.net.
[01:39:53.862 --> 01:39:55.643]  Go sign up for it.
[01:39:55.883 --> 01:39:58.044]  I never plug this, and I should.
[01:39:58.064 --> 01:40:00.205]  I really should.
[01:40:00.225 --> 01:40:03.747]  And you also support us by getting my videos.
[01:40:03.807 --> 01:40:07.169]  Now, that's not why you should get them, because they're great videos.
[01:40:07.941 --> 01:40:11.203]  I mean, I've got stuff that'll curl your hair, turn your hair white.
[01:40:11.924 --> 01:40:15.025]  I mean, I've got the globalists caught engaged in their criminal activities.
[01:40:15.326 --> 01:40:17.247]  We list the long train of abuses.
[01:40:17.507 --> 01:40:19.188]  We expose how criminal they are.
[01:40:19.488 --> 01:40:21.650]  The average person hasn't figured this out yet.
[01:40:21.670 --> 01:40:24.932]  9-11 road to tyranny.
[01:40:24.992 --> 01:40:25.812]  Masters of terror.
[01:40:25.872 --> 01:40:27.713]  Police state three total enslavement.
[01:40:29.174 --> 01:40:30.235]  Matrix of evil.
[01:40:30.295 --> 01:40:31.516]  My book, Descent into Tyranny.
[01:40:31.556 --> 01:40:33.477]  Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos.
[01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:37.362]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[01:40:37.882 --> 01:40:41.805]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com, which are now back up.
[01:40:41.845 --> 01:40:43.326]  I'm told they were down for about 30 minutes.
[01:40:44.026 --> 01:40:46.048]  We're having to put bigger servers in.
[01:40:48.449 --> 01:40:55.374]  And you need to go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and you need to get my videos.
[01:40:55.474 --> 01:40:56.475]  You need to order them.
[01:40:56.495 --> 01:40:58.136]  You need to stop procrastinating.
[01:40:58.816 --> 01:41:00.237]  These are amazing films.
[01:41:00.318 --> 01:41:00.818]  I mean, take...
[01:41:02.685 --> 01:41:06.808]  Two minutes of the two-hour, 40-minute film, Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[01:41:07.848 --> 01:41:09.409]  Bush finishes up giving his speech.
[01:41:10.130 --> 01:41:13.972]  I ask him about the CFR and Trilateral Commission, Federal Reserve.
[01:41:14.733 --> 01:41:16.794]  I say, sir, isn't that what's destroying America?
[01:41:17.515 --> 01:41:19.596]  And he has me kidnapped, and it's all on video.
[01:41:20.396 --> 01:41:23.278]  That's two minutes of the film.
[01:41:23.498 --> 01:41:26.620]  And by the way, if you or I did that to somebody, we'd be charged with kidnapping.
[01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:29.042]  Just like when Charles Key, in the 90s,
[01:41:32.068 --> 01:41:38.513]  In the 96 elections, remember, he was one of the three Republican speakers at the debate.
[01:41:38.954 --> 01:41:40.375]  He was scheduled to be in the debate.
[01:41:40.835 --> 01:41:54.286]  And when he got there, the Secret Service grabbed him, ordered police to put him in a car and drive him around for an hour, and they threw him out on the other side of town in a literal crack-infested neighborhood.
[01:41:54.306 --> 01:41:56.267]  That's how he described it.
[01:41:56.628 --> 01:41:59.630]  They threw him out in a dangerous junkie park.
[01:42:00.345 --> 01:42:01.185]  That was a kidnapping.
[01:42:01.225 --> 01:42:02.646]  Well, the same thing happened to me.
[01:42:02.986 --> 01:42:04.027]  And there's video of him.
[01:42:04.807 --> 01:42:05.807]  He finishes his speech.
[01:42:05.887 --> 01:42:07.168]  I calmly ask the question.
[01:42:07.608 --> 01:42:11.230]  They grab me, almost break my arm, tell me, you're in deep trouble, boy.
[01:42:11.290 --> 01:42:16.092]  Drag me outside, slam me up against the wall, put me in a car, tell me how my life's over.
[01:42:17.072 --> 01:42:23.095]  And then they drive me around for almost an hour and throw me out on the side of the highway in the middle of nowhere.
[01:42:24.775 --> 01:42:26.876]  So that's two minutes of one film, okay?
[01:42:27.336 --> 01:42:28.537]  Two minutes of one film.
[01:42:29.767 --> 01:42:31.128]  Two minutes of one film.
[01:42:31.868 --> 01:42:33.249]  They're all over two hours long.
[01:42:33.309 --> 01:42:34.990]  It's all jammed with stuff like that.
[01:42:35.711 --> 01:42:37.272]  I cannot describe what's in these videos.
[01:42:37.652 --> 01:42:37.972]  Get them.
[01:42:38.132 --> 01:42:39.633]  They're $25.95 a piece.
[01:42:40.193 --> 01:42:41.114]  Order three or more.
[01:42:41.514 --> 01:42:43.836]  They drop down to $20 a piece.
[01:42:44.476 --> 01:42:45.737]  Call right now, folks.
[01:42:45.757 --> 01:42:45.817]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:42:53.081 --> 01:42:55.962]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:42:56.802 --> 01:43:08.226]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:43:09.826 --> 01:43:15.008]  Or again, InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:43:15.868 --> 01:43:17.329]  And get the videos and make copies.
[01:43:17.369 --> 01:43:20.349]  Let's go to some calls and I'll get back into this stack of vital news.
[01:43:21.530 --> 01:43:21.890]  Robert...
[01:43:23.065 --> 01:43:24.067]  In Illinois.
[01:43:24.127 --> 01:43:25.428]  Go ahead, and then John and others.
[01:43:25.668 --> 01:43:26.630]  Yeah, Alex, hello.
[01:43:26.650 --> 01:43:27.771]  Robert Cullen from Chicago.
[01:43:27.791 --> 01:43:29.313]  A couple things I wanted to pass along.
[01:43:29.373 --> 01:43:38.484]  First of all, there's this message that's going out over the email in regard to that Sylvia v. Locklear case on the Ninth Circuit Court of Abuses and Defraudments in California.
[01:43:38.624 --> 01:43:40.386]  Okay, let me just stop you for a second.
[01:43:41.232 --> 01:43:48.716]  Because listeners call in who are info junkies, you know all about stuff, you start talking like we're having a private conversation here.
[01:43:49.617 --> 01:43:51.598]  Don't talk 100 miles an hour like I do.
[01:43:51.978 --> 01:43:53.299]  Tell folks what you're talking about.
[01:43:53.519 --> 01:43:53.840]  Okay.
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:44:03.545]  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is incredibly abusive, as we all know, has claimed that the right to keep and bear arms is not an individual right.
[01:44:03.565 --> 01:44:05.526]  And that all guns can be banned.
[01:44:05.887 --> 01:44:06.287]  Correct.
[01:44:06.807 --> 01:44:14.074]  And the problem we're having, that is, it's enormously abominable, and people can go read the case of that Silver v. Lockyer.
[01:44:14.114 --> 01:44:15.255]  I forget the second.
[01:44:15.295 --> 01:44:16.676]  Silvera v. Lockyer.
[01:44:16.696 --> 01:44:17.878]  Silvera v. Lockyer.
[01:44:17.958 --> 01:44:18.198]  Okay.
[01:44:18.458 --> 01:44:21.461]  But they can go read the case, and what people have to understand is this.
[01:44:22.145 --> 01:44:34.450]  Is that the denial of the petition for the writ of certiorari, although it does show the corruption of the Supreme Court and it's useful for that purposes, that does not constitute a legal affirmation of the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal.
[01:44:34.731 --> 01:44:36.511]  And the reason this is very important is this.
[01:44:38.303 --> 01:44:43.368]  States and jurisdictions that that ruling binds are those under the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal.
[01:44:43.689 --> 01:44:50.215]  People have to bring similar cases in all of the other 12 jurisdictions for the following reason.
[01:44:50.556 --> 01:44:54.820]  Because amongst all those judges, not all of them are totally corrupted.
[01:44:55.168 --> 01:44:57.311]  Well, that's already happened with the Fifth Circuit in Louisiana.
[01:45:09.136 --> 01:45:09.616]  Good to hear.
[01:45:09.636 --> 01:45:10.997]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:45:11.137 --> 01:45:20.403]  Edith Jones, we have to find the judges that have some accountability, and they get on a panel, and then we get authority that's incompatible with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and then we start building the case.
[01:45:20.483 --> 01:45:31.970]  But these people were sending out emails, the guy Edgar Steele, I think it was, that now that's the law throughout the country, and it's very important to make that distinction, that no, we have to keep bringing cases in all the different circuits.
[01:45:32.230 --> 01:45:36.874]  So we can get authority that shows the fraudulence and criminality of that Ninth Circuit case.
[01:45:36.974 --> 01:45:40.777]  Yeah, that's the same court that doesn't want to have the Pledge of Allegiance.
[01:45:40.817 --> 01:45:41.397]  Thanks for the call.
[01:45:42.458 --> 01:45:54.067]  And, of course, there was a so-called conservative court in Kentucky three years ago, that federal court, that ruled that... Now, brace yourselves for this.
[01:45:54.287 --> 01:45:57.229]  The Declaration of Independence is unconstitutional.
[01:45:59.701 --> 01:46:02.822]  I mean, folks, this is like saying apple pie is an apple pie.
[01:46:04.002 --> 01:46:05.723]  It's like saying mama ain't mama.
[01:46:06.343 --> 01:46:08.103]  It's like saying the sun isn't the sun.
[01:46:08.163 --> 01:46:10.244]  I mean, it's just, these people make me sick.
[01:46:10.284 --> 01:46:17.225]  It's like the judge going, yeah, well, you can't protest Bush on a public street with a sign amongst those that support Bush.
[01:46:17.465 --> 01:46:18.966]  They're allowed to, but you're not.
[01:46:19.126 --> 01:46:19.966]  I'm ruling that.
[01:46:20.006 --> 01:46:20.706]  You're convicted.
[01:46:21.106 --> 01:46:23.287]  I got the judge's quotes right here, folks.
[01:46:24.527 --> 01:46:25.107]  Unbelievable.
[01:46:25.127 --> 01:46:26.047]  Thanks for the call, Robert.
[01:46:26.067 --> 01:46:26.567]  Good points.
[01:46:27.368 --> 01:46:28.688]  John in Colorado, go ahead.
[01:46:30.087 --> 01:46:32.289]  Yes, thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:39.876]  The reason why I called is I have an answer, solution, and a request for a gentleman to come on your program.
[01:46:39.916 --> 01:46:45.360]  He's from Florida, and he's indirectly involved right now as we speak with the solution that I'm bringing to you.
[01:46:46.121 --> 01:46:57.110]  The answer to the problem of arresting people who are protesting with the signs saying no blood for oil is the fact that you've got to ask yourself, what is their status?
[01:46:57.614 --> 01:47:00.838]  Are they either illegal aliens, legal aliens, or U.S.
[01:47:01.298 --> 01:47:09.728]  citizens, which are, of course, citizens of a federal corporation, Title 28, Section 3002, Subsection 15, Paragraph 8.
[01:47:09.908 --> 01:47:10.909]  That's where you'll find that.
[01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:14.033]  These people do not have rights.
[01:47:14.113 --> 01:47:15.915]  They have privileges, and you know that.
[01:47:16.582 --> 01:47:17.423]  That's what happened.
[01:47:17.904 --> 01:47:32.443]  Well, sir, sir, sir, they can say we're all under the 14th Amendment and so indentured servants, property of the corporation, but that, you know, sir, sir, sir, sir, sir, this is a fight for the hearts and minds of the people.
[01:47:32.623 --> 01:47:34.766]  We all know we still have the First Amendment.
[01:47:34.986 --> 01:47:38.248]  So the First Amendment's still there, and we're not going to go along with this.
[01:47:38.468 --> 01:47:40.069]  And if they want to arrest us, that's fine.
[01:47:40.349 --> 01:47:41.529]  More of us should get arrested.
[01:47:41.849 --> 01:47:49.353]  Next time Bush comes to Texas, I'm going to try to make it there and stand with the worshipers with a sign against Bush, and I'm going to let them arrest me.
[01:47:49.673 --> 01:47:50.714]  More of us should do that.
[01:47:50.734 --> 01:47:52.195]  All right, here's the solution.
[01:47:52.435 --> 01:47:55.116]  The solution is that each state is a sovereign nation.
[01:47:55.176 --> 01:47:55.316]  Why?
[01:47:55.336 --> 01:47:56.577]  Because it has a constitution.
[01:47:56.837 --> 01:47:58.038]  We're not one nation under God.
[01:47:58.058 --> 01:48:00.739]  We're a union of nations under God.
[01:48:01.438 --> 01:48:03.200]  Here's the point.
[01:48:03.220 --> 01:48:04.561]  Where am I going with this?
[01:48:04.822 --> 01:48:09.966]  The point is there are no citizens in Texas, no Texas citizens, no Colorado citizens.
[01:48:10.427 --> 01:48:14.270]  They're either one of the three categories that I just mentioned.
[01:48:14.311 --> 01:48:15.231]  Let me just tell you this.
[01:48:15.351 --> 01:48:20.456]  You go declare yourself with the sheriff and everybody, a citizen of your county of that state.
[01:48:20.697 --> 01:48:21.317]  Let me finish.
[01:48:21.557 --> 01:48:22.899]  They're going to take you to jail still.
[01:48:22.919 --> 01:48:24.460]  They're going to charge you in their same system.
[01:48:25.041 --> 01:48:26.302]  Okay, here's the thing.
[01:48:26.854 --> 01:48:28.935]  You have to go through a three-step process.
[01:48:29.015 --> 01:48:33.397]  I've been doing this for ten years, and I've heard all this, and I've watched it, and let me tell you something.
[01:48:33.697 --> 01:48:35.378]  It does not work.
[01:48:35.758 --> 01:48:36.879]  It's about to work.
[01:48:36.919 --> 01:48:40.601]  There's a gentleman by the name of John Jennings that's in the process in Florida doing it.
[01:48:41.121 --> 01:48:53.307]  He's already won a case, not an at-law court, not a case law court, in a state court, an in-law court where you're dealing with laws legislated by state legislators, not by a judge presiding at the bench.
[01:48:54.184 --> 01:48:55.065]  You see the difference?
[01:48:55.105 --> 01:48:55.505]  He won!
[01:48:55.585 --> 01:48:56.626]  He won!
[01:48:56.946 --> 01:48:58.147]  Sir, I appreciate your call.
[01:48:59.208 --> 01:48:59.989]  You know what I'll do?
[01:49:00.990 --> 01:49:02.751]  I'll do some shows on the Federal Reserve.
[01:49:02.791 --> 01:49:04.533]  I'll do some shows on the 14th Amendment.
[01:49:04.793 --> 01:49:10.978]  I'll do some shows on common law and the incorporation of the states and the incorporation of the District of Columbia.
[01:49:11.559 --> 01:49:18.845]  But believe me, and I'm not mad at you, caller, it's good points you're making, 98% of people listening do not even know what you were talking about.
[01:49:19.606 --> 01:49:22.248]  And so we can't just sit here on one call and go over this.
[01:49:23.543 --> 01:49:30.568]  But it gets into admiralty law, maritime jurisdiction, which is the Patriot Act, which is what they're using.
[01:49:30.808 --> 01:49:42.316]  They're now trying to replace the Constitution, the organic law, the stuff that comes out of the Magna Carta in 1214 and back to Mount Sinai thousands of years ago, 3,000 years ago.
[01:49:43.857 --> 01:49:45.418]  With Moses and the Ten Commandments.
[01:49:45.758 --> 01:49:52.000]  That's why they're trying to remove the foundation of Western law that came out of Israel.
[01:49:52.380 --> 01:49:58.163]  They're trying to remove that now and put in Roman civil law or magistrate law.
[01:49:58.843 --> 01:50:07.266]  And that gets into the Uniform Commercial Code, and it gets into these different types of courts they've set up.
[01:50:08.423 --> 01:50:21.167]  And what he's talking about is the example here of where they say, well, we're going to put you in jail for six months and give you a $5,000 fine for peacefully protesting, but you can't have a jury trial because this is a petty crime.
[01:50:21.927 --> 01:50:24.868]  We're going to take your house, but you can't have a jury trial because it's a petty crime.
[01:50:25.209 --> 01:50:32.551]  They change definitions, create false courts, and give themselves authority because they're backed up by bailiffs with guns.
[01:50:33.746 --> 01:50:34.367]  We're good to go.

[01:51:52.856 --> 01:51:56.137]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:51:56.197 --> 01:52:00.358]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:52:00.619 --> 01:52:03.399]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:52:03.599 --> 01:52:06.000]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:52:06.180 --> 01:52:14.843]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:52:15.023 --> 01:52:16.384]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:52:16.564 --> 01:52:20.805]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:52:21.045 --> 01:52:22.766]  of the self-sterilizing filters.
[01:52:23.026 --> 01:52:34.974]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[01:52:35.174 --> 01:52:41.658]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.

[01:52:52.402 --> 01:52:56.724]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:52:56.924 --> 01:53:01.326]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:53:01.486 --> 01:53:05.847]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:53:05.967 --> 01:53:07.228]  A New World Order.
[01:53:08.048 --> 01:53:09.030]  Can emerge.
[01:53:09.050 --> 01:53:13.274]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:53:13.334 --> 01:53:20.262]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:53:20.402 --> 01:53:22.385]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:53:22.705 --> 01:53:28.049]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:53:28.089 --> 01:53:30.550]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:53:30.570 --> 01:53:31.231]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:53:31.271 --> 01:53:31.531]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:53:31.591 --> 01:53:32.732]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:04.581]  All right, let's go back to the calls.
[01:54:04.861 --> 01:54:13.283]  I just want to make a comment about all this common law stuff and state citizenship versus federal citizenship.
[01:54:13.823 --> 01:54:16.544]  A lot of it is based in reality and facts.
[01:54:17.304 --> 01:54:27.707]  And people are trying to address this fraudulent federal system that is controlled by a criminal crime syndicate.
[01:54:28.700 --> 01:54:39.543]  And so people try to address it and get a redress of grievances by declaring themselves a sovereign or outside the jurisdiction.
[01:54:39.943 --> 01:54:45.305]  And certainly that's legitimate because this system is a fraud.
[01:54:46.365 --> 01:54:53.147]  But I'm telling you, it's like highwaymen at a road stop saying you've got to pay a toll to pass this bridge.
[01:54:53.687 --> 01:54:55.167]  They don't have a law behind them.
[01:54:55.667 --> 01:54:57.788]  They may pin a tin badge to their breast,
[01:54:58.482 --> 01:54:58.802]  We're good to go.
[01:54:58.822 --> 01:54:59.162]  We're good to go.
[01:55:22.609 --> 01:55:25.471]  And a lot of these people, you know, I got a trust.
[01:55:25.932 --> 01:55:31.435]  Sign up with a trust with me, and then I watch the person, you know, grab somebody's property.
[01:55:32.876 --> 01:55:43.764]  So all I'm saying is just because somebody says they're a patriot or says they've got all the answers, you know, don't just blindly run into it and believe it all.
[01:55:45.285 --> 01:55:46.586]  That's all I'm trying to say here.
[01:55:48.067 --> 01:55:51.990]  You know, we know the government's bad, but at the same time, you can't believe everything you hear.
[01:55:52.631 --> 01:55:54.573]  I mean, I tell you, don't believe what I say, folks.
[01:55:54.733 --> 01:55:55.633]  Check it out.
[01:55:56.054 --> 01:55:57.495]  I'm all about the facts.
[01:55:58.355 --> 01:56:11.766]  And anybody who wants me to interview these different people, these different schools of thought about how to address this fraudulent system, is welcome to email me at tipsandinfowars.com.
[01:56:13.266 --> 01:56:16.269]  And I'll look at it and perhaps have some of them on the show.
[01:56:16.289 --> 01:56:27.057]  I'm thinking about doing a whole series of shows, maybe two or three shows, where I spend several hours each broadcast having the different schools of thought on to debate with each other.
[01:56:29.779 --> 01:56:31.961]  And then we'll let you decide.
[01:56:32.782 --> 01:56:34.663]  But yes, is there a fraud in this system?
[01:56:34.783 --> 01:56:35.124]  Yes.
[01:56:36.385 --> 01:56:39.367]  But does that mean that all the answers to it are the silver bullet?
[01:56:39.387 --> 01:56:40.027]  No.
[01:56:40.288 --> 01:56:40.488]  No.
[01:56:41.198 --> 01:56:44.962]  Does that mean that there aren't some good ideas and some effective tactics in there?
[01:56:45.362 --> 01:56:45.783]  Yes.
[01:56:46.624 --> 01:56:51.849]  I mean, pro se litigants, pro se defenders are winning more cases on average.
[01:56:52.470 --> 01:57:02.200]  I saw the numbers in 2000, haven't seen them since then, but are winning more cases than lawyers are, than bar certified lawyers.
[01:57:02.741 --> 01:57:03.722]  So it's real.
[01:57:04.582 --> 01:57:06.223]  But a lot of people get burned.
[01:57:06.603 --> 01:57:12.367]  So I'm not going to sit here and give out legal advice other than within the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[01:57:13.188 --> 01:57:19.993]  And I'm very careful about who I have on this show, spouting off all their wonderful legal remedies.
[01:57:21.554 --> 01:57:32.301]  I'll tell you who has been effective and won a bunch of federal and state cases, and it's a very lengthy process, but he knows what he's doing, and that's George Gordon.
[01:57:33.189 --> 01:57:33.569]  Okay?
[01:57:33.809 --> 01:57:36.370]  And he works within the system to defeat their system.
[01:57:37.390 --> 01:57:44.972]  But a lot of these other people I've investigated, I mean over years, I've had an open mind here, are frauds.
[01:57:45.912 --> 01:57:47.552]  I'm just trying to protect you folks.
[01:57:48.192 --> 01:57:59.315]  We'll come back and go to Dave in Delaware, Robert in Michigan, Myra in South Dakota, Vig in Colorado, Mike in Indiana, everybody else.
[01:57:59.755 --> 01:58:00.935]  We'll get to you, don't worry.
[01:58:02.287 --> 01:58:09.489]  And then I've got a bunch of other news stories here that are all so vitally important and some top news I'll also recap.
[01:58:09.569 --> 01:58:14.731]  But the problem is the globalists are attacking us from a thousand different angles.
[01:58:15.931 --> 01:58:26.834]  And the thing that's going to be the biggest part of the solution is getting the general public to realize history that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely everything.
[01:58:27.316 --> 01:58:30.837]  And get back to a Bill of Rights culture and restrict the size of government.
[01:58:31.378 --> 01:58:37.640]  Then no matter what criminals we've got in government, they're not going to have the mechanisms to control our lives.
[01:58:38.881 --> 01:58:40.461]  That's what the Founding Fathers said.
[01:58:41.022 --> 01:58:41.902]  I'll stick with them.
[01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:47.161]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:58:47.221 --> 01:58:51.382]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:58:51.643 --> 01:58:54.443]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:58:54.623 --> 01:58:57.024]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:58:57.224 --> 01:59:05.867]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:59:06.067 --> 01:59:07.408]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:59:07.608 --> 01:59:11.849]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:59:12.089 --> 01:59:13.810]  of the self-sterilizing filters.
[01:59:14.050 --> 01:59:25.998]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[01:59:26.198 --> 01:59:32.682]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[01:59:32.962 --> 01:59:40.205]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:59:40.885 --> 01:59:47.748]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:59:49.969 --> 01:59:50.649]  Big Brother.
[01:59:51.290 --> 01:59:52.330]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:53.050 --> 01:59:54.191]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:54.811 --> 01:59:55.651]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.392 --> 01:59:57.152]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.956 --> 02:00:01.899]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.119 --> 02:00:06.242]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:08.604 --> 02:00:09.705]  All right, my friends.
[02:00:10.765 --> 02:00:17.771]  We're now into the third and final hour of this January 8th, 2004 edition.
[02:00:17.791 --> 02:00:18.971]  I'm still getting used to that.
[02:00:19.852 --> 02:00:22.294]  We've got Bob Chapman, the international forecaster.
[02:00:23.075 --> 02:00:23.655]  Coming on.
[02:00:24.356 --> 02:00:29.939]  And I respect his opinion because he's made a lot of amazing predictions in the past.
[02:00:30.119 --> 02:00:33.461]  I mean, two, three, four years out that have come true.
[02:00:34.361 --> 02:00:37.623]  And so we're going to have him on about the economy and a bunch of other different news items.
[02:00:37.663 --> 02:00:40.244]  He, of course, worked in military intelligence.
[02:00:40.965 --> 02:00:44.547]  And it's made the government very mad at him lately for what he's been forecasting.
[02:00:46.068 --> 02:00:47.348]  Right now, let's go to the calls.
[02:00:47.408 --> 02:00:48.189]  Let's talk to...
[02:00:50.251 --> 02:00:53.054]  Oh, I guess up next is Dave in Delaware.
[02:00:53.134 --> 02:00:53.875]  Go ahead, Dave.
[02:00:54.395 --> 02:00:55.036]  Alex, how are you?
[02:00:55.416 --> 02:00:55.696]  Fine.
[02:00:56.037 --> 02:00:58.479]  I was talking to a friend who's a district attorney.
[02:00:59.560 --> 02:00:59.840]  Yes.
[02:01:00.221 --> 02:01:07.908]  And we were talking about the cameras that have been put in transformers, you know, the telephone lines and telephone poles.
[02:01:08.629 --> 02:01:11.551]  I had another friend who actually, you know, is a technician.
[02:01:11.591 --> 02:01:12.192]  He was telling me,
[02:01:12.924 --> 02:01:14.967]  That they're actually, you can't even see them.
[02:01:14.987 --> 02:01:15.768]  They're really small.
[02:01:15.828 --> 02:01:17.190]  We know how small cameras can be now.
[02:01:17.390 --> 02:01:22.917]  Okay, for those, since you just got on with this subject, there are the visible cameras.
[02:01:23.484 --> 02:01:23.604]  Yep.
[02:01:24.025 --> 02:01:36.757]  But there have been hundreds of thousands, and there's company websites, news announcements, sold where it looks like a transformer, but it's really a surveillance pod with cameras in it.
[02:01:36.977 --> 02:01:37.978]  And yes, go ahead.
[02:01:38.118 --> 02:01:46.766]  And when I heard about that, I couldn't believe it, but the source that it was telling me, it was a highly trusted source, and it was confirmed by a couple of other people, and I really believe them because they're
[02:01:47.168 --> 02:01:48.189]  They're just technician types.
[02:01:48.209 --> 02:01:49.629]  They have nothing to do with anything.
[02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:57.894]  Well, sir, just type into a search engine, hidden cameras and transformers and streetlights, and you'll have hundreds of mainstream news articles.
[02:01:58.234 --> 02:02:03.837]  When I was talking to this district attorney about this, I said, what's going on with these cameras everywhere?
[02:02:04.057 --> 02:02:05.918]  This district attorney knew about it.
[02:02:06.619 --> 02:02:10.841]  And the district attorney said, yeah, we know about these sort of things, and we can't do anything about it.
[02:02:10.861 --> 02:02:13.122]  I said, well, what about our right to privacy and all that sort of stuff?
[02:02:13.702 --> 02:02:16.264]  And this district attorney said, well, that only covers...
[02:02:16.690 --> 02:02:17.350]  What you write.
[02:02:18.210 --> 02:02:19.771]  It doesn't cover your image.
[02:02:21.091 --> 02:02:23.092]  So you can be photographed as much as you want.
[02:02:23.112 --> 02:02:25.153]  And that's totally false.
[02:02:26.313 --> 02:02:31.895]  Again, they tell these district attorneys, they tell cops, you know, there's no First Amendment anymore unless you're on the moon.
[02:02:31.915 --> 02:02:34.676]  And they go, okay, there's no freedom unless you're on the moon.
[02:02:35.016 --> 02:02:36.316]  It's just totally made up.
[02:02:37.417 --> 02:02:42.178]  So he said we can do nothing about it, of course, because it's federally funded for the states and counties.
[02:02:42.278 --> 02:02:45.059]  But did he say why they could do nothing about it?
[02:02:45.914 --> 02:02:55.645]  Again, when the issue of privacy came up, it was made clear to me through the district attorney that you're only covered in the things that you write.
[02:02:56.554 --> 02:02:57.795]  Whatever you write.
[02:02:58.475 --> 02:03:00.736]  Oh, so they can put a camera in the school bathroom now.
[02:03:00.896 --> 02:03:02.636]  That's a total fraud.
[02:03:02.676 --> 02:03:04.017]  People go to jail all the time.
[02:03:04.557 --> 02:03:09.799]  A cop just did up in New York for videotaping people peeping Toms.
[02:03:09.839 --> 02:03:11.340]  This is pure garbage.
[02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:13.020]  I don't even know who's watching these things.
[02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:14.361]  I don't know if it's the sheriffs.
[02:03:14.421 --> 02:03:17.562]  Oh, you obviously didn't hear yesterday's show.
[02:03:18.450 --> 02:03:18.951]  No, I missed that one.
[02:03:19.251 --> 02:03:31.782]  They're going to have people to graduate from high school have to spend hours every day watching these cameras fed into their computers, and they're going to have citizens watching them and then reporting to police.
[02:03:32.458 --> 02:03:34.940]  Well, as I said, your image is not covered.
[02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:36.761]  But that's not true.
[02:03:36.941 --> 02:03:38.422]  Well, that's what they're telling us.
[02:03:38.502 --> 02:03:43.526]  He can say black people are slaves, and they've got to be out in the field with a bit in their mouth.
[02:03:43.766 --> 02:03:44.387]  It isn't true.
[02:03:44.747 --> 02:03:45.688]  Well, they're doing it anyway.
[02:03:45.708 --> 02:03:50.671]  So every time you step out of your house, or even when you're not out of your house, assume that you're being videotaped or video recorded.
[02:03:51.011 --> 02:03:53.793]  Well, they also have ground-penetrating radar that looks right through your walls.
[02:03:54.294 --> 02:03:54.674]  Sure.
[02:03:54.854 --> 02:04:01.339]  But, I mean, tell this fool that what he said, a two-year-old should know that's not true.
[02:04:02.540 --> 02:04:04.681]  Well, yeah, perhaps.
[02:04:04.761 --> 02:04:09.043]  I mean, they're sort of powerless themselves in a lot of ways.
[02:04:09.603 --> 02:04:11.384]  Perhaps he's wrong.
[02:04:12.184 --> 02:04:13.845]  They do have a right to privacy.
[02:04:13.885 --> 02:04:15.705]  It's not just what you write.
[02:04:15.965 --> 02:04:16.946]  That's ridiculous.
[02:04:16.966 --> 02:04:18.366]  Just don't go.
[02:04:18.386 --> 02:04:19.647]  I thought I'd just let you know.
[02:04:20.387 --> 02:04:21.788]  Oh, no, I really appreciate your call.
[02:04:22.008 --> 02:04:24.669]  Where are you located in Delaware?
[02:04:24.729 --> 02:04:25.109]  Wilmington.
[02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:29.191]  And your district attorney told you...
[02:04:30.328 --> 02:04:32.409]  Well, no, this is a district attorney.
[02:04:32.429 --> 02:04:33.609]  I don't want to say who it is.
[02:04:34.850 --> 02:04:36.190]  Okay, well, hey, I appreciate the call.
[02:04:36.230 --> 02:04:37.411]  I'm not mad at you, you understand.
[02:04:37.451 --> 02:04:39.331]  I'm just upset about what he said.
[02:04:40.072 --> 02:04:41.572]  And I appreciate you sharing that with us.
[02:04:41.632 --> 02:04:42.473]  It's very informative.
[02:04:42.833 --> 02:04:43.293]  We'll be back.
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:46.000]  We're good to go.
[02:05:06.738 --> 02:05:09.701]  Good health is achievable when you tune into Achieving Great Health.
[02:05:09.721 --> 02:05:15.165]  If you want to learn more on how to naturally rid the body of any disease, listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley.
[02:05:31.599 --> 02:05:32.220]  We're good to go.
[02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:32.680]  We're good to go.
[02:05:45.310 --> 02:05:48.771]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:05:49.051 --> 02:05:52.553]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:05:52.633 --> 02:05:56.574]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:05:56.814 --> 02:06:02.956]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:06:03.376 --> 02:06:11.279]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:06:11.619 --> 02:06:12.740]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you a
[02:06:41.662 --> 02:06:43.404]  888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:06:44.905 --> 02:06:52.272]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:06:52.552 --> 02:06:57.296]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:06:57.517 --> 02:07:03.162]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:07:03.402 --> 02:07:05.344]  ...and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:07:29.702 --> 02:07:34.823]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:07:34.863 --> 02:07:35.123]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:07:35.143 --> 02:07:35.643]  Big Brother.
[02:07:35.703 --> 02:07:36.784]  Mainstream media.
[02:07:36.964 --> 02:07:37.864]  Government cover-ups.
[02:07:37.904 --> 02:07:38.904]  You want answers?
[02:07:39.164 --> 02:07:39.544]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:58.052 --> 02:08:01.695]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:02.236 --> 02:08:06.359]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:10.943 --> 02:08:14.527]  All right, folks, we're eight minutes and 30 seconds into this third hour.
[02:08:14.547 --> 02:08:19.171]  Let me hit a couple of top headlines, then we're going to go to Bob Chapman, and we'll go to...
[02:08:22.054 --> 02:08:22.495]  We're good to go.
[02:08:45.615 --> 02:08:47.216]  This is big headlines.
[02:08:47.296 --> 02:08:49.917]  It's on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[02:08:50.397 --> 02:08:54.319]  Also, the New York Times reporting the White House says they don't care what federal judges say.
[02:08:54.799 --> 02:09:01.802]  They're going to continue to enforce arresting citizens without charging them for any suspicion of terrorism.
[02:09:02.582 --> 02:09:07.024]  And under Section 802, all suspicion of misdemeanors is terrorism.
[02:09:07.325 --> 02:09:09.145]  So that's the enemy combatant designation.
[02:09:09.746 --> 02:09:10.006]  U.S.
[02:09:10.046 --> 02:09:12.827]  copter goes down in Iraq, killing nine people.
[02:09:14.298 --> 02:09:14.999]  We're good to go.
[02:09:43.894 --> 02:09:44.595]  We're good to go.
[02:09:44.615 --> 02:09:44.935]  I think?
[02:10:04.160 --> 02:10:17.029]  How were you able... I mean, I also, from what the IMF and World Bank said they were going to do to us, was saying it was going to go down, but how do you come upon your system of analysis?
[02:10:18.050 --> 02:10:27.377]  Well, you have to remember I'm old, and I've been doing this for 44 years, virtually the same thing, and that is researching...
[02:10:28.158 --> 02:10:29.019]  I think we're good.
[02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:52.041]  So we've got a pretty good handle on what's going on, and the experience really helps.
[02:10:52.121 --> 02:10:58.022]  We've been through several bull markets in gold and silver, most of them small except for 1978-80.
[02:10:58.842 --> 02:11:03.503]  And we work 18 hours a day at it, and I do it because I love it.
[02:11:05.924 --> 02:11:07.764]  Give folks some background on yourself.
[02:11:08.764 --> 02:11:16.426]  Well, I went to university, and the government invited me to join them, as they did in the olden days.
[02:11:16.466 --> 02:11:17.246]  They drafted you.
[02:11:18.221 --> 02:11:18.721]  Absolutely.
[02:11:18.741 --> 02:11:18.902]  Bob?
[02:11:42.190 --> 02:11:43.411]  What is the New World Order?
[02:11:43.671 --> 02:11:45.152]  What are they doing financially?
[02:11:45.292 --> 02:11:47.973]  What do you see happening in the near term and the long term?
[02:11:48.614 --> 02:11:57.018]  Well, the dollar will continue down another 40% versus the dollar index as well as the euro, whether the Europeans like it or not.
[02:11:57.959 --> 02:12:00.220]  And it's been overpriced for a long, long time.
[02:12:01.420 --> 02:12:05.102]  The price of gold this year will easily go over to $512 an ounce.
[02:12:05.122 --> 02:12:11.766]  It could very well go to $680 or $840 for that matter, depending upon what happens.
[02:12:12.543 --> 02:12:20.328]  Like if we send troops into Lebanon and other places, then gold's going to jump more than it would otherwise.
[02:12:21.088 --> 02:12:27.232]  It's interesting, your commentary just earlier, I see that they're sending in several hundred mercenaries.
[02:12:28.513 --> 02:12:36.317]  The United States government is into Georgia, and that they're going to train the Georgian military there.
[02:12:37.118 --> 02:12:40.600]  And that is really the equivalent of Russia saying,
[02:12:43.082 --> 02:12:46.484]  Well, they are.
[02:12:46.504 --> 02:12:50.407]  I tell you, it's really heating up.
[02:12:51.467 --> 02:12:59.472]  And incidentally, you know, they're extending for two years all of those who are in the military who are going to retire.
[02:13:00.393 --> 02:13:05.176]  And they're also forcing an extended tour for another two years.
[02:13:05.660 --> 02:13:08.881]  For those who are up for re-enlistment or their terms are up.
[02:13:09.142 --> 02:13:14.904]  And now they're calmly talking about invading Syria, that's the Pentagon report, and Lebanon.
[02:13:14.924 --> 02:13:16.525]  I mean, this is amazing.
[02:13:17.125 --> 02:13:20.587]  Alex, the big question is, are they going to draft you and I again?
[02:13:23.388 --> 02:13:24.709]  I don't think they want us.
[02:13:26.990 --> 02:13:29.671]  We might have a strike and the military would all sit down.
[02:13:31.171 --> 02:13:32.112]  Well, it's amazing.
[02:13:32.132 --> 02:13:32.392]  So...
[02:13:35.419 --> 02:13:38.700]  You see the dollar going down even more?
[02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:40.321]  Considerably more.
[02:13:40.741 --> 02:13:42.802]  Gold and silver going considerably higher.
[02:13:43.622 --> 02:13:45.383]  The current account deficit going higher.
[02:13:45.443 --> 02:13:48.284]  The fiscal budget deficit going higher.
[02:13:48.304 --> 02:13:51.765]  I see interest rates starting up this year.
[02:13:52.045 --> 02:13:56.667]  Ron Paul says we're going to have a depression, and believe me, I don't like hearing that.
[02:13:58.047 --> 02:14:01.409]  And meanwhile, people are saying, hey, the economy's up, the economy's up.
[02:14:01.449 --> 02:14:02.249]  What's going on there?
[02:14:02.907 --> 02:14:06.389]  Well, they threw a lot of money at the economy two ways.
[02:14:06.589 --> 02:14:10.451]  One, by a tax break, the second one, second tax break.
[02:14:10.551 --> 02:14:24.138]  And then the Fed, along with the fiscal profligacy of the United States government and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they've been creating somewhere around $1.5 to $1.7.5 trillion a year for the last four years.
[02:14:24.878 --> 02:14:26.439]  So that's what's kept things going.
[02:14:26.479 --> 02:14:31.822]  That's what's kept deflation and depression from grabbing the economy and sucking it down.
[02:14:32.569 --> 02:14:37.511]  Now, they can't do that forever, and what's going to happen is we're going to have inflation.
[02:14:37.991 --> 02:14:49.436]  Whether we'll get 13% again like we did in 1979-80 remains to be seen, but just 7, 8, or 6, 7, 8, 9% is enough to throw gold easily over 1,000 with silver trailing behind.
[02:14:50.176 --> 02:14:53.578]  And so you have this box that they're in.
[02:14:53.618 --> 02:14:54.318]  There's no way out.
[02:14:54.358 --> 02:15:00.901]  So they will inflate first, buying time, and then we will go into a depression, and Ron Paul is right.
[02:15:01.334 --> 02:15:07.197]  And incidentally, this year, as I was going to say, interest rates will go up at least a point and probably a point and a half.
[02:15:07.977 --> 02:15:10.438]  Now, when that happens, mortgage rates go up.
[02:15:11.038 --> 02:15:16.621]  And the sale of new homes and existing homes have slowed down in the last four months.
[02:15:17.061 --> 02:15:18.241]  This could be the top.
[02:15:18.601 --> 02:15:24.024]  And if interest rates go up, we could have a slide in real estate, and that would take away people's confidence.
[02:15:24.044 --> 02:15:25.084]  The game would be over.
[02:15:25.444 --> 02:15:28.085]  And then the stock market would go back and test the $72.36.
[02:15:29.850 --> 02:15:31.491]  And then it would break it and go lower.
[02:15:32.991 --> 02:15:47.558]  Now, Bob, the stock market's up quite a bit, obviously hasn't gotten back all of its losses, but if the dollar's devalued by 40-plus percent, then it's going to take more of those dollars to buy stock.
[02:15:47.638 --> 02:15:50.119]  So in reality, the stock market's actually down.
[02:15:50.199 --> 02:15:51.099]  Is that fair to say?
[02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:54.541]  That's fair to say, and it should be pointed out.
[02:15:55.376 --> 02:16:04.021]  That major American corporations are using their cash to buy their own shares as well as other S&P and Dow-based shares.
[02:16:04.982 --> 02:16:13.987]  And the United States government's plunge protection team, the working group in financial markets as it's officially known, is in the market every day rigging it.
[02:16:16.736 --> 02:16:21.338]  Now, this is publicly admitted, but the average American has no idea of its existence.
[02:16:21.558 --> 02:16:26.020]  Explain the market group and what the Plunge Protection Team does.
[02:16:26.601 --> 02:16:44.209]  Well, first of all, the market group is directed supposedly by the Secretary of the Treasury, the head of the Fed, the New York Fed, the CFTC, and the President of the New York Stock Exchange, when in fact they have a group of people that are ramrodded by the Undersecretary of State,
[02:16:45.087 --> 02:16:53.596]  And they're the ones, they have full-time staff, 24 hours a day, just absolutely doing as they please in the markets, which are tax dollars.
[02:16:54.257 --> 02:17:02.866]  And you ask why the public doesn't know, that's why they have the Alex Jones Show and other shows like it, so that people can really learn the truth.
[02:17:03.743 --> 02:17:11.265]  And that really is top-down market manipulation and insider trading on the giant industrial scale.
[02:17:11.285 --> 02:17:18.728]  Then they'll go after an inch-long minnow, as I describe her, like Martha Stewart, who's done nothing compared to the Enrons and others.
[02:17:18.788 --> 02:17:25.790]  But again, that's institutionalized fraud is okay with Grasso getting a hundred-and-something million kickback when he left.
[02:17:26.390 --> 02:17:29.951]  Well, she's not connected, and she's not part of the...
[02:17:30.566 --> 02:17:37.352]  ...elitist group, part of a conspiracy that has existed for many, many years.
[02:17:38.093 --> 02:17:40.015]  And she's being made a goat of.
[02:17:40.836 --> 02:17:44.299]  Quite frankly, I don't think she did anything wrong, but let the jury decide.
[02:17:45.560 --> 02:17:51.846]  But the point is that I was involved and have been involved for 44 years with the brokerage business directly and indirectly.
[02:17:52.486 --> 02:17:53.547]  And the FCC and the NASD...
[02:17:55.359 --> 02:18:08.433]  For the most part, go after the little guys, the small and medium-sized brokerage firms, the little brokers who can't afford to challenge them, and they have perpetually left the mutual funds, and the large brokerage firms get away with financial murder.
[02:18:08.453 --> 02:18:12.658]  Well, they even admit the Martha Stewart thing is to, quote, increase confidence...
[02:18:13.584 --> 02:18:21.010]  Oh, she might have done some after-hours trading when she knew the stock was about to go down, involving a couple hundred thousand, maybe a million bucks.
[02:18:21.090 --> 02:18:23.131]  Ooh, we really busted a big one for you.
[02:18:23.151 --> 02:18:25.433]  She ran a stop sign if she's guilty.
[02:18:26.414 --> 02:18:26.754]  Really.
[02:18:27.555 --> 02:18:28.976]  That's how ludicrous it is.
[02:18:29.336 --> 02:18:36.681]  The guy that's really done a lot is the Attorney General for the City of New York, which is Elliot Spitzer.
[02:18:36.701 --> 02:18:38.643]  I mean, he's just ripped their pants down.
[02:18:39.855 --> 02:18:45.199]  He's just shown that the SEC does nothing, nothing but pander to the conspiracy.
[02:18:45.319 --> 02:18:47.120]  Okay, well, that's a good question.
[02:18:47.180 --> 02:18:53.805]  Why is Eliot Spencer, if New York's the heart of this, actually, I mean, what is he really up to?
[02:18:54.185 --> 02:19:00.269]  Well, I think he wants to aspire to higher office, and I think that's a wonderful idea.
[02:19:00.289 --> 02:19:07.334]  I mean, he's exposing all these evil people, and believe me, that's the correct word.
[02:19:08.413 --> 02:19:11.736]  But again, I know these globalists who go after people that mess with them.
[02:19:11.756 --> 02:19:13.037]  Why haven't they gone after Spitzer?
[02:19:13.297 --> 02:19:17.640]  Maybe he has, at the moment, too high a visibility.
[02:19:18.321 --> 02:19:19.382]  Exactly, I agree.
[02:19:20.383 --> 02:19:21.804]  I mean, he'd be a hard man to whack.
[02:19:23.465 --> 02:19:29.130]  All right, we're going to come back and get into more of your predictions and when this depression's coming.
[02:19:29.350 --> 02:19:30.931]  And folks, I don't like talking like this.
[02:19:31.351 --> 02:19:37.076]  Ron Paul says on this show and in Matrix of Evil, the video, we're going to have a depression.
[02:19:38.357 --> 02:19:39.878]  I don't like what Bob Chapman's saying.
[02:19:39.898 --> 02:19:42.880]  I don't like what Ron Paul says, but they have credibility.
[02:19:45.541 --> 02:19:45.961]  Gold.
[02:19:46.321 --> 02:19:47.602]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:19:47.862 --> 02:19:53.945]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:19:54.146 --> 02:19:57.968]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:19:58.308 --> 02:20:00.209]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:20:00.269 --> 02:20:00.429]  Mint,
[02:20:00.789 --> 02:20:02.529]  Demand is at an all-time high.
[02:20:02.669 --> 02:20:10.391]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[02:23:49.741 --> 02:23:50.882]  All right, my friends.
[02:23:51.042 --> 02:23:56.924]  We're about to go to Robert and Myron and Mike and others that are patiently holding.
[02:23:59.884 --> 02:24:04.786]  Going back to Bob Chapman, international forecaster, and we'll tell you about the newsletter here in a few minutes.
[02:24:06.787 --> 02:24:08.248]  Bob, I get confused.
[02:24:08.268 --> 02:24:09.649]  They say they invaded Iraq.
[02:24:09.749 --> 02:24:15.653]  One of the reasons was because Iraq had said openly they were about to start only accepting euros for oil.
[02:24:17.131 --> 02:24:22.354]  Or the new gold standard the other Arab countries, the DNR, were setting up.
[02:24:22.894 --> 02:24:29.658]  But then at the same time, Treasury Secretary Snowe is running around bad-mouthing the dollar, saying dropping dollars is a great thing.
[02:24:30.198 --> 02:24:34.320]  They're keeping the interest rates low, which is the big effect.
[02:24:34.981 --> 02:24:38.923]  So far, an investment is leaving right when the euro comes online.
[02:24:38.943 --> 02:24:41.464]  I mean, this is all obviously being choreographed.
[02:24:42.060 --> 02:24:44.562]  Well, in the last five years, the switching, as Iraq did,
[02:25:08.362 --> 02:25:12.903]  To the Euro for trading in oil was confrontational.
[02:25:13.864 --> 02:25:16.785]  On the other hand, I wrote articles back in the early 1990s.
[02:25:16.885 --> 02:25:19.445]  In fact, I mentioned in my next issue.
[02:25:20.366 --> 02:25:31.709]  And I said the reason that Iraq is going to be invaded is that they want to, they, the United States, wants to outflank Russia.
[02:25:32.634 --> 02:25:45.124]  That was the first consideration, and the movement of troops into Turkmenistan and now Georgia and other areas up there proves the point, especially the taking of Afghanistan.
[02:25:45.624 --> 02:25:57.013]  And so that's a very good point, the first strongest point for the administration, because they can indirectly and perhaps directly control the supply of oil.
[02:25:58.296 --> 02:26:13.419]  You then move to Saudi Arabia, which could very well be on the verge of an Islamic civil war, and that would have the effect of the United States moving their military in there to bring stability.
[02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:20.241]  And so what they're up to here is wrapping up all the oil supplies in the Middle East and
[02:26:20.945 --> 02:26:23.346]  And Iraq just happens to be step number one.
[02:26:24.146 --> 02:26:28.027]  They are looking for excuses to go into Iran and Syria.
[02:26:28.047 --> 02:26:29.387]  Now you talk about Lebanon.
[02:26:29.407 --> 02:26:35.628]  But another part of that question is, why are they killing the dollar?
[02:26:35.648 --> 02:26:47.471]  They're killing the dollar because I really believe, and I have for a long time, that they want to make the United States into a financial, economic...
[02:26:49.266 --> 02:26:53.187]  entity which is on a par with Europe, if not lower.
[02:26:54.267 --> 02:27:06.630]  And by doing that to the dollar, the present reserve currency, they can bring that about in outsourcing of both corporations as well as particular jobs.
[02:27:07.450 --> 02:27:10.531]  It's absolutely ripping this country apart.
[02:27:11.318 --> 02:27:13.579]  There's no way we can survive.
[02:27:13.599 --> 02:27:19.721]  Well, I mean, I've heard them on the news and on NPR admit, oh, this will teach us Americans not to live outside our means.
[02:27:20.041 --> 02:27:21.541]  Ha, ha, ha, it's so cute.
[02:27:21.941 --> 02:27:28.443]  Which will also consolidate wealth into a tinier elite with a smaller, more manageable middle class.
[02:27:28.483 --> 02:27:30.644]  But, you know, you talk about Saudi Arabia may fall.
[02:27:30.764 --> 02:27:31.344]  Exactly.
[02:27:31.664 --> 02:27:38.026]  The Saudis have said that MI6 is in there blowing stuff up to destabilize it.
[02:27:38.246 --> 02:27:40.067]  They want a radical Islamic regime.
[02:27:40.467 --> 02:27:42.528]  So they then have an excuse to send troops in.
[02:27:42.548 --> 02:27:43.268]  Mm-hmm.
[02:27:44.729 --> 02:27:53.592]  And as far as debt is concerned in the United States, it's encouraged by the Federal Reserve, our banking system, particularly in the issuance of credit cards.
[02:27:55.013 --> 02:27:56.533]  Most people are behind the eight ball.
[02:27:56.573 --> 02:28:01.395]  In fact, every program I'm on, the first thing I've got to tell people is, please get out of debt.
[02:28:01.435 --> 02:28:05.296]  I know you have to have a house to get the tax write-off, but everything else, clear it out.
[02:28:05.777 --> 02:28:09.178]  And then you move into gold coins, and once you've done that, you move into gold shares.
[02:28:09.836 --> 02:28:19.143]  And at the end of the road here, wherever gold and silver are going to, you may not want to sell what you have in exchange for fiat currency.
[02:28:22.125 --> 02:28:29.290]  Well, I've been buying gold for three years, and it's all increasing value, whether I bought it at $250 or $350.
[02:28:31.091 --> 02:28:34.193]  And people are calling me saying, you want to sell that gold?
[02:28:34.834 --> 02:28:35.634]  And no, I don't.
[02:28:37.135 --> 02:28:38.156]  You've got a long way to go.
[02:28:38.880 --> 02:28:41.742]  I mean, we haven't even finished phase one of three phases.
[02:28:42.503 --> 02:28:53.772]  Gold is going over $3,000 an ounce, where silver and gold are hard to say, but it could easily go back to its high in the $40, $50 area, and perhaps even to $100, because there just isn't any out there.
[02:28:53.992 --> 02:28:56.274]  Now, you're saying $500 by the end of the year?
[02:28:56.294 --> 02:28:57.134]  Easily.
[02:28:57.655 --> 02:29:01.298]  And then where is this $3,000 mark?
[02:29:01.358 --> 02:29:02.098]  That's probably in 2005, 2006.
[02:29:05.618 --> 02:29:06.879]  And nothing happens overnight.
[02:29:06.919 --> 02:29:09.720]  You know, all the years I've been in there, she learned to have patience.
[02:29:10.441 --> 02:29:11.221]  Oh, I understand.
[02:29:13.903 --> 02:29:18.786]  Now, can we see a correction in gold before it goes back up?
[02:29:19.146 --> 02:29:20.947]  We've already seen it in the last few days.
[02:29:20.967 --> 02:29:21.747]  It's going higher.
[02:29:22.488 --> 02:29:24.149]  They're trying to suppress it, and they can't.
[02:29:25.470 --> 02:29:28.251]  Okay, we'll come back, take three or four calls, I promise, folks.
[02:29:28.291 --> 02:29:31.173]  Then we'll get into how they suppress gold prices.
[02:29:31.413 --> 02:29:32.874]  And again, this is public, too.
[02:29:33.394 --> 02:29:34.575]  This isn't secret.
[02:29:35.948 --> 02:29:36.849]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.329 --> 02:29:38.930]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:39.871 --> 02:29:42.673]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:46.135 --> 02:29:49.037]  We've all heard the ads for lower prices on airfare and hotel.
[02:29:49.057 --> 02:29:51.059]  Oh yeah, the dot-coms are endless.
[02:29:51.219 --> 02:29:56.843]  Cheaperhotels.com, saveonyourrentalcar.com, halfpriceairlinetickets.com.
[02:29:56.943 --> 02:30:02.707]  Problem is, by the time you get done planning your vacation, you've visited dozens of websites and spent hours and hours trying to save money.
[02:30:02.847 --> 02:30:05.289]  Well, I'm glad to tell you there's an easier way to get it all at once.

[02:30:22.999 --> 02:30:23.680]  Not convinced yet?
[02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:27.542]  How about auto repair, health and beauty, financial services or shopping discounts?
[02:30:27.682 --> 02:30:30.564]  There are over 60,000 vendors waiting to save you money.

[02:30:46.877 --> 02:30:47.377]  Late summer 2003.
[02:30:47.757 --> 02:30:51.881]  Mainstream press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[02:30:52.281 --> 02:30:53.502]  Late summer 2002, I heard the same thing.
[02:30:55.458 --> 02:30:58.319]  Late summer 2001, you heard the same thing.
[02:30:58.700 --> 02:31:05.843]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently trading in the 93 to 9400 range, is down 7% from two years ago.
[02:31:06.344 --> 02:31:07.244]  That's recovery?
[02:31:07.864 --> 02:31:13.067]  Gold, now trading in the $360 range, is up 31% in that same period.
[02:31:13.467 --> 02:31:15.048]  Where do you want your hard-earned money?
[02:31:15.708 --> 02:31:18.490]  Hi folks, this is Jack Brown with Midas Resources.
[02:31:23.152 --> 02:31:24.713]  I love the sound of real money.
[02:31:25.134 --> 02:31:30.479]  Call your representative today at Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[02:31:30.899 --> 02:31:35.484]  Learn how to protect your assets with real wealth, not potentially worthless paper.
[02:31:35.864 --> 02:31:36.685]  Call now, 800-686-2237.
[02:31:36.745 --> 02:31:36.925]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:31:44.648 --> 02:31:46.169]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:31:46.349 --> 02:31:47.469]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:31:47.670 --> 02:31:51.051]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:31:51.171 --> 02:31:51.612]  Phenol?
[02:31:51.912 --> 02:31:59.035]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:31:59.336 --> 02:32:03.438]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:32:03.538 --> 02:32:03.978]  Fragrance?
[02:32:04.378 --> 02:32:09.119]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:32:09.260 --> 02:32:13.941]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[02:32:14.161 --> 02:32:16.722]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[02:32:16.982 --> 02:32:20.383]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:32:20.543 --> 02:32:24.064]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:32:24.284 --> 02:32:26.665]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:32:26.805 --> 02:32:27.686]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:32:46.697 --> 02:32:49.439]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:32:49.459 --> 02:32:53.301]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:32:56.144 --> 02:32:58.125]  Waging war on corruption, folks.
[02:32:59.045 --> 02:33:07.227]  I've always believed in gold because, well, you've got some paper currency that can be manipulated, and it's always manipulated.
[02:33:08.747 --> 02:33:13.029]  The big banks like to create depressions and recessions to consolidate power.
[02:33:15.209 --> 02:33:18.870]  But all these years I told you, don't own gold, stay in the stock market.
[02:33:21.331 --> 02:33:24.812]  And then now a lot of them are saying, okay, better buy some gold, and so the...
[02:33:26.221 --> 02:33:28.943]  Fraudmeisters are having trouble suppressing it.
[02:33:28.963 --> 02:33:30.344]  We'll talk about how they do that.
[02:33:30.865 --> 02:33:33.166]  But right now, I'm here with our guest Bob Chapman.
[02:33:33.186 --> 02:33:34.207]  Let's take a couple calls.
[02:33:35.168 --> 02:33:38.871]  Robert, you're on the air.
[02:33:38.951 --> 02:33:39.751]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:33:40.432 --> 02:33:41.292]  Robert from Michigan.
[02:33:41.593 --> 02:33:41.873]  Yes.
[02:33:42.573 --> 02:33:43.054]  Two points.
[02:33:43.854 --> 02:33:53.502]  I was wondering if you heard recently that 165 communities have passed ordinance against the Patriot Act.
[02:33:54.302 --> 02:33:54.502]  Any...
[02:33:55.979 --> 02:34:03.103]  Employee, government employee of that community or county will be prosecuted or charged if they try to enforce it on any of its citizens.
[02:34:05.184 --> 02:34:09.086]  Yes, in fact, I was part of getting the Patriot Act thrown out in Austin.
[02:34:09.646 --> 02:34:17.030]  I was either the first or one of the first people to write the law, and we have that law.
[02:34:17.130 --> 02:34:25.554]  I wrote on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in the Patriot Act sections, and where I also have my analysis of it,
[02:34:26.095 --> 02:34:30.938]  And it's not 160, it's over 400 cities and four states.
[02:34:31.918 --> 02:34:34.180]  But the news keeps reporting 200 cities, 150 cities.
[02:34:34.220 --> 02:34:37.362]  I mean, that was a year ago.
[02:34:37.382 --> 02:34:38.862]  It's well over 400.
[02:34:39.283 --> 02:34:42.745]  I'll have to call George at the Emissary Review and tell him to revise that.
[02:34:43.185 --> 02:34:45.666]  Point number two, this is for Bob.
[02:34:47.147 --> 02:34:52.230]  Over history, silver has been basically 10 to 1 to 15 to 1 up until the late 70s.
[02:34:57.280 --> 02:35:01.621]  To me, it looks like silver has a long way to go to get in its own perspective.
[02:35:03.102 --> 02:35:13.745]  I think you're right, but I think that the ratio lost its significance with the demonetization of silver back in the late 1960s.
[02:35:14.566 --> 02:35:20.728]  And I do think silver's going to go up, but for different reasons, and that is supply-demand.
[02:35:21.768 --> 02:35:25.229]  There's just too much more silver needed every year.
[02:35:25.922 --> 02:35:27.263]  For industry and other things.
[02:35:27.483 --> 02:35:29.745]  And I think that that is going to continue.
[02:35:29.765 --> 02:35:35.370]  And I think the above ground supplies are very, very, very small.
[02:35:36.231 --> 02:35:45.238]  And I think that those people who are short on the CFTC and comics, I think that they have been continuing to short.
[02:35:45.398 --> 02:35:51.743]  And the only way that they can absorb the kind of losses that they are is they have to have somebody behind them guaranteeing that.
[02:35:52.244 --> 02:35:53.745]  And the same goes for the gold market.
[02:35:54.321 --> 02:35:56.322]  And I believe that's the United States government.
[02:35:57.162 --> 02:35:57.603]  All right.
[02:35:57.663 --> 02:35:59.464]  Well, does that answer your question?
[02:35:59.744 --> 02:36:01.244]  Yeah, one more quick one.
[02:36:01.665 --> 02:36:07.808]  As far as taking possession versus paper on gold, I'm in the process of selling a home.
[02:36:07.848 --> 02:36:11.649]  I want to buy some hedge gold and silver.
[02:36:11.910 --> 02:36:12.550]  You do both.
[02:36:12.890 --> 02:36:21.414]  Out of 100% of the funds that you have available, you want to have 25%, maybe more, in coins in the remainder, in shares.
[02:36:21.474 --> 02:36:22.515]  And the reason why is that
[02:36:23.254 --> 02:36:29.398]  There's enormous leverage in the shares, but you have to be careful because the leverage works both ways.
[02:36:29.458 --> 02:36:33.561]  In other words, if silver doubles, you might have a silver stock that went up eight times.
[02:36:34.582 --> 02:36:41.706]  And so you've got to get some good advice, too, from someone who specializes in that area.
[02:36:42.027 --> 02:36:42.747]  Well, thank you very much.
[02:36:42.807 --> 02:36:46.430]  On the coin and bullion, you absolutely take delivery.
[02:36:47.770 --> 02:36:48.691]  That's what I feel, yes.
[02:36:49.191 --> 02:36:50.252]  Well, listen, thanks, Robert.
[02:36:50.612 --> 02:36:51.413]  You've been very informative.
[02:36:52.603 --> 02:36:57.446]  All righty, let's go ahead and talk to Myron in South Dakota.
[02:36:57.486 --> 02:36:58.267]  Go ahead, Myron.
[02:36:58.367 --> 02:37:00.448]  Yes, Alex, you were talking about the courts earlier.
[02:37:00.468 --> 02:37:04.110]  You know, if you go to the Constitution, Article 3, Section 1, the courts are...
[02:37:07.168 --> 02:37:08.209]  Oh, I didn't hear that.
[02:37:08.229 --> 02:37:11.111]  I was going to ask you, Alex, are you familiar with Kevin Phillips?
[02:37:33.178 --> 02:37:33.618]  Yes.
[02:37:33.999 --> 02:37:35.059]  The name rings a bell.
[02:37:35.119 --> 02:37:36.200]  Refresh my memory.
[02:37:36.220 --> 02:37:37.961]  Oh, he goes back to the Nixon era.
[02:37:38.181 --> 02:37:45.505]  He wrote a book, and he was on C-SPAN Monday, and then yesterday morning he was on IMAS, and this last night he was on Scarborough.
[02:37:46.285 --> 02:37:53.449]  He wrote a book called American Dynasty, Aristocracy, Fortune, and the Politics of Deceit in the House of Bush.
[02:37:53.549 --> 02:37:55.210]  It's all about the Bush family.
[02:37:55.270 --> 02:37:56.811]  So that would be kind of interesting.
[02:37:56.831 --> 02:37:58.432]  You may want to get a hold of this guy.
[02:37:59.813 --> 02:38:02.454]  And one other question I have for Chapman up
[02:38:02.830 --> 02:38:12.954]  Was there any investigation in the selling of put options on UAL for American Airlines before 9-11?
[02:38:13.174 --> 02:38:19.117]  After 9-11, yes, but we have never been, as a public, privy to those findings.
[02:38:20.337 --> 02:38:21.718]  Well, we know who was involved.
[02:38:21.758 --> 02:38:26.200]  There were a lot of former deputy and executive directors of the CIA involved.
[02:38:26.540 --> 02:38:30.701]  They busted two FBI agents in New York who were involved only in, I believe it was a $300,000...
[02:38:33.148 --> 02:38:34.970]  And I hadn't even heard what you just said.
[02:38:56.351 --> 02:38:57.252]  I've never seen that anyway.
[02:38:57.272 --> 02:39:01.996]  Yeah, that's New York Daily News and New York Post.
[02:39:02.016 --> 02:39:03.077]  Just little blurbs.
[02:39:03.137 --> 02:39:03.337]  Yep.
[02:39:03.777 --> 02:39:06.359]  Yeah, I get the Post every morning as well as the Times.
[02:39:08.942 --> 02:39:11.624]  Well, that was right after 9-11.
[02:39:11.664 --> 02:39:22.093]  About six months after 9-11, those two boys, two FBI agents, got to prison time for insider trading on 9-11 prior knowledge.
[02:39:22.173 --> 02:39:23.634]  And then you never heard about it again.
[02:39:26.118 --> 02:39:28.098]  There was a lot of people who didn't get apprehended.
[02:39:30.179 --> 02:39:30.819]  Absolutely.
[02:39:31.139 --> 02:39:32.400]  Alex, one other thing.
[02:39:32.900 --> 02:39:47.823]  I was watching C-SPAN earlier this week in the morning Washington Journal, and there was a little blurb that Richard Vigory, who has been a big guru in the conservative movement, raising money for conservatives, he thought maybe with the Bush administration's 50% increase in size since they've been in control,
[02:39:51.297 --> 02:39:58.699]  That maybe we'd be better off to have Howard Dean become elected president, and maybe the Republicans will start acting like Republicans again.
[02:39:58.999 --> 02:40:00.519]  Well, see, you're a liberal.
[02:40:00.719 --> 02:40:02.340]  You're against gun control.
[02:40:02.360 --> 02:40:03.620]  You're against open borders.
[02:40:03.960 --> 02:40:06.181]  You're against cutting Taiwan loose to China.
[02:40:06.581 --> 02:40:07.601]  You're a communist.
[02:40:07.681 --> 02:40:10.402]  If you support communism, you're a neocon.
[02:40:10.722 --> 02:40:16.063]  Bob, would you like to comment on the massive growth of the government, the police state, all of it?
[02:40:17.782 --> 02:40:24.125]  Well, I think it's there for all to see, and the intention is the suppression of the American people.
[02:40:24.966 --> 02:40:36.111]  And that's part of the syndrome of taking the United States down to a level where they're not going to argue with these people when they want to institute a world currency and a world government.
[02:40:37.452 --> 02:40:39.813]  By the way, the father, Mundell, of the...
[02:40:43.126 --> 02:40:44.086]  I'm having trouble here.
[02:40:44.166 --> 02:40:51.849]  Not the IMF, of the EU, on Monday, what Charles Mundell called for a world currency.
[02:40:51.889 --> 02:40:58.510]  He said, well, since we have a problem with the euro versus the dollar now, we always knew this was the plan, let's go ahead and merge the two.
[02:40:59.231 --> 02:41:03.352]  Yeah, he was instrumental in the formulation of the euro starting back in 1972.
[02:41:04.712 --> 02:41:08.293]  And I wrote a piece about him this week, which will appear in the next issue.
[02:41:10.783 --> 02:41:27.377]  So now, as we knew they would do, because their plans have been public for a while, they just don't put them in the nightly news, how long till... First they're going to move to a global system that just sets the rates of the currencies, then they're going to move to one currency.
[02:41:27.417 --> 02:41:28.377]  How long do we see that?
[02:41:29.618 --> 02:41:32.601]  The evolutionary process could take a number of years.
[02:41:33.622 --> 02:41:35.983]  At least a minimum of four to five.
[02:41:36.584 --> 02:41:40.267]  And I think they're grandiose ideas and
[02:41:40.831 --> 02:41:43.093]  And that's why they're gearing up the police state to suppress.
[02:41:43.273 --> 02:41:43.873]  Exactly.
[02:42:09.196 --> 02:42:13.219]  That's why you absolutely never turn in your weapon.
[02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:33.376]  And by the way, folks, for those who don't understand, that's not my opinion, it's not Bob Chapman's opinion, how important were the Joseph Sticklitz World Bank documents that got released two years ago, Bob, where they admitted that they like to create depressions, then that cause riots, then they can have a police state crack down and put a dictatorship in place?
[02:42:34.156 --> 02:42:35.978]  Absolutely, and they came right out and said that.
[02:42:37.805 --> 02:42:43.748]  And Stiglitz, they call him a rogue now.
[02:42:43.768 --> 02:42:48.051]  This is a man who worked within that structure for many, many years.
[02:42:48.111 --> 02:42:49.331]  Well, he was the head economist.
[02:42:49.731 --> 02:42:50.212]  That's right.
[02:42:51.592 --> 02:42:52.753]  I wonder why he quit.
[02:42:52.793 --> 02:42:53.614]  Well, he said why.
[02:42:53.654 --> 02:42:55.715]  He said he couldn't sleep anymore.
[02:42:55.735 --> 02:43:01.378]  Well, there are some people out there who have a conscience who are involved in that whole thing.
[02:43:02.338 --> 02:43:04.339]  And there's millions of people involved.
[02:43:04.359 --> 02:43:05.520]  They're all over the world.
[02:43:06.280 --> 02:43:08.843]  That know what's going on inside.
[02:43:09.643 --> 02:43:13.107]  It's just that the remainder of the world, the other 99%, don't have a clue.
[02:43:14.568 --> 02:43:15.890]  Well, that really is the problem.
[02:43:15.970 --> 02:43:17.271]  They don't have a clue.
[02:43:17.872 --> 02:43:19.093]  And they don't want to hear about it.
[02:43:19.914 --> 02:43:20.915]  You know, don't bother me.
[02:43:20.935 --> 02:43:21.695]  They're sheeple.
[02:43:23.177 --> 02:43:28.042]  Well, I tell folks that the dollar's down by over 40%, and they go, what's that mean?
[02:43:28.712 --> 02:43:32.735]  And I go, haven't you heard that Mexico had a low-value peso?
[02:43:32.775 --> 02:43:33.676]  That's a bad thing.
[02:43:33.916 --> 02:43:35.697]  You know, Russian rubles, ha, ha, ha.
[02:43:36.097 --> 02:43:38.159]  And they don't even know what I'm talking about.
[02:43:38.179 --> 02:43:39.480]  No, you're right.
[02:43:40.801 --> 02:43:44.083]  And we're not talking about people who dig ditches.
[02:43:44.103 --> 02:43:46.565]  We're talking about people with university degrees.
[02:43:47.526 --> 02:43:52.749]  And, you know, if you hark back to the time you were in school, you'll say to yourself, gee, in Echo 1, 2, and 3,
[02:43:54.414 --> 02:43:58.595]  I never was told anything about gold or silver or classical economics.
[02:43:58.695 --> 02:44:02.756]  It was Samuelson's book and all that garbage, and that's all I ever learned.
[02:44:05.017 --> 02:44:07.037]  So it goes back to the educational system.
[02:44:07.077 --> 02:44:10.158]  I just had a major study of 339 universities.
[02:44:11.018 --> 02:44:16.579]  Over 65% didn't know what the First Amendment was, and that was administrators, too.
[02:44:16.639 --> 02:44:19.740]  And then they would tell them what it was, and they said, oh, no, I don't agree with that.
[02:44:21.481 --> 02:44:21.861]  Well, good.
[02:44:21.901 --> 02:44:22.801]  Go to another country.
[02:44:25.069 --> 02:44:26.370]  Well, I mean, I have this problem.
[02:44:26.390 --> 02:44:29.712]  You know, the Pope called for a New World Order last Friday.
[02:44:29.732 --> 02:44:30.773]  It was in CNN.
[02:44:31.433 --> 02:44:35.116]  And I still get emails saying, I'm crazy, there's no such thing as a New World Order.
[02:44:36.837 --> 02:44:38.598]  Well, people can't project themselves.
[02:44:40.319 --> 02:44:42.381]  And most of them are too busy trying to make a living.
[02:44:43.662 --> 02:44:44.162]  Amazing.
[02:44:44.202 --> 02:44:49.366]  We're going to go to some more calls here in a second, but thanks for the call, Myron.
[02:44:50.586 --> 02:44:51.287]  Bob Chapman.
[02:44:52.142 --> 02:44:59.485]  I want to briefly, before we go to more calls, talk about how, and there's been lawsuits over this, how the big banks suppress the price of gold.
[02:44:59.525 --> 02:45:00.145]  How do they do that?
[02:45:02.246 --> 02:45:04.606]  The big banks are used as the instrument.
[02:45:04.646 --> 02:45:17.711]  We're talking about JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, and they act and in all probability are guaranteed against loss by the U.S.
[02:45:17.751 --> 02:45:18.151]  Treasury.
[02:45:18.854 --> 02:45:20.535]  There's a subsidiary to the U.S.
[02:45:20.595 --> 02:45:28.060]  Treasury formed in 1934 called the ESF, which is the Exchange Stabilization Fund.
[02:45:29.001 --> 02:45:40.069]  And they use that fund to influence the stock market through the plunge protection team, and they also use that fund to suppress the price of gold and silver and anything else that they want to do.
[02:45:40.669 --> 02:45:42.030]  And that's basically how it's done.
[02:45:42.070 --> 02:45:43.131]  It's just that simple.
[02:45:43.832 --> 02:45:51.798]  It's just if you ask a thousand people in America what's the Exchange Stabilization Fund, there may be one or two that know what it is.
[02:45:53.479 --> 02:45:56.060]  And chances are they work for it.
[02:45:56.101 --> 02:45:56.681]  Probably.
[02:45:56.781 --> 02:46:00.964]  Either that or they listen to your program or read the International Forecaster.
[02:46:01.764 --> 02:46:11.011]  Now, one of the lawsuits that was brought against them by a big gold mining association was they take ten big banks, all...
[02:46:11.906 --> 02:46:17.687]  It has been in the past, but they may be doing that right now, but more so they're going in and suppressing the market, and that's because
[02:46:39.830 --> 02:46:45.836]  They have this tremendous physical offtake going on, particularly from India, China, and the Middle East.
[02:46:46.877 --> 02:46:48.678]  That's where most of the buying is coming from.
[02:46:49.099 --> 02:46:54.924]  Now, officially, official holdings of gold are 32,000 tons.
[02:46:56.586 --> 02:47:00.470]  There's one group that estimates 15,000 of it have been sold.
[02:47:01.010 --> 02:47:01.731]  My estimate is 22,000.
[02:47:03.499 --> 02:47:08.322]  Well, also, you know, I tell people every time I talk about how gold has been confiscated four separate times in the last 80 years...
[02:47:29.147 --> 02:47:30.950]  They roll their eyes at you.
[02:47:31.852 --> 02:47:33.455]  But my grandparents remember it.
[02:47:33.996 --> 02:47:37.141]  I've got one grandmother left now, but they all remember it.
[02:47:37.362 --> 02:47:40.728]  And talk to an old person before they're gone, but you can also get the news stories.
[02:47:41.509 --> 02:47:42.531]  But Roosevelt...
[02:47:43.723 --> 02:47:44.864]  First act as president.
[02:47:45.224 --> 02:47:47.506]  Turn your gold in.
[02:47:48.007 --> 02:47:48.947]  I'll give you paper.
[02:47:49.328 --> 02:47:56.253]  After all the gold was turned in, they turned around and doubled the price of gold after it had been publicly sold to Europe at the reduced price.
[02:47:56.333 --> 02:47:57.814]  I mean, that's highway robbery.
[02:47:58.175 --> 02:48:02.518]  And we've been buying American 20s from Europe here in the United States ever since.
[02:48:02.538 --> 02:48:07.883]  Yeah, I've talked to the gold brokers and the gold buyers.
[02:48:07.923 --> 02:48:08.763]  That's where it comes from.
[02:48:08.783 --> 02:48:09.524]  That's right.
[02:48:09.824 --> 02:48:13.147]  Buying our gold back that they got for paper money they gave us.
[02:48:13.635 --> 02:48:14.115]  That's right.
[02:48:15.596 --> 02:48:20.178]  So if we have scams that big, Bob, how do we stop them from doing that to us again?
[02:48:20.598 --> 02:48:30.762]  All we can do is what we're doing right now and trying to inform the public because they're not going to get the truth in the media from their politicians, from their universities.
[02:48:30.782 --> 02:48:32.203]  We've just got to do the best we can do.
[02:48:36.312 --> 02:48:49.615]  Yeah, they can come take your children, take your wife, take your gold, take your car, but having the money in the bank or a safety deposit box is even worse because the new Patriot Act doesn't even let you keep gold or cash in a safety deposit box.
[02:48:49.995 --> 02:48:51.235]  Now they can go take it from you.
[02:48:51.595 --> 02:48:53.596]  Well, that means you've got to bury it, doesn't it?
[02:48:55.856 --> 02:48:57.517]  This is so overtly criminal.
[02:48:58.417 --> 02:49:02.698]  How do they convince our grandparents, your parents, Bob, to turn their gold in for paper?
[02:49:03.908 --> 02:49:10.391]  Well, I think one of the things you have to consider is that not an awful lot of people owned gold in those days because we're in the middle of depression.
[02:49:11.412 --> 02:49:14.633]  And a lot of it had been sold in order to get money to live.
[02:49:15.373 --> 02:49:19.796]  And what was left was probably in the hands of the more wealthy.
[02:49:22.197 --> 02:49:23.998]  I mean, you know, just look back.
[02:49:24.038 --> 02:49:27.239]  We had a depression that began in 1929.
[02:49:28.019 --> 02:49:29.700]  The worst years of depression was 33, 34, and 35.
[02:49:29.740 --> 02:49:30.521]  And had it not been for
[02:49:34.553 --> 02:49:42.999]  It's amazing, Bob.
[02:49:44.180 --> 02:49:47.823]  So how long until we go into this depression that Ron Paul's talking about?
[02:49:48.804 --> 02:49:50.466]  Oh, we'll go in starting next year.
[02:49:51.286 --> 02:49:53.628]  And the following year, I think it'll be in the streets.
[02:49:56.811 --> 02:49:58.572]  Now, you never talk like this, Bob.
[02:49:58.612 --> 02:49:59.793]  Why do you think that's going to happen?
[02:50:00.494 --> 02:50:03.276]  Well, it's a simple...
[02:50:05.729 --> 02:50:07.869]  Group of events, one of which follows another.
[02:50:08.270 --> 02:50:09.150]  You have a depression.
[02:50:09.490 --> 02:50:10.430]  You have unemployment.
[02:50:10.910 --> 02:50:12.811]  You have people who lose their residences.
[02:50:13.211 --> 02:50:15.072]  You have people who don't have any money left.
[02:50:15.112 --> 02:50:16.552]  You have people going bankrupt.
[02:50:16.833 --> 02:50:18.593]  You have people who can't feed their children.
[02:50:19.794 --> 02:50:21.654]  They're going to go out there and start raising heck.
[02:50:23.995 --> 02:50:27.536]  Yeah, we're not the Christian society we were in the 1930s.
[02:50:29.597 --> 02:50:32.158]  Can I chop some wood for you for a sandwich, man?
[02:50:33.306 --> 02:50:35.627]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[02:50:36.587 --> 02:50:37.827]  Bob Chapman, final segment.

[02:52:48.307 --> 02:52:52.708]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:52:52.868 --> 02:52:57.250]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:52:57.290 --> 02:52:58.630]  The New World Order.
[02:52:59.430 --> 02:53:00.031]  Can emerge.
[02:53:00.432 --> 02:53:04.636]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.

[02:54:07.417 --> 02:54:10.558]  How do folks get a copy of that before we take a couple final calls?
[02:54:11.039 --> 02:54:15.441]  We publish weekly by the Internet, by email, and...
[02:54:16.531 --> 02:54:21.335]  It runs around 30 or 40 pages a week, and we publish twice a month in hard copy.
[02:54:22.116 --> 02:54:24.217]  You can get an introductory copy by calling 877-479-8178.
[02:54:24.257 --> 02:54:24.798]  And I'll repeat that.
[02:54:24.818 --> 02:54:24.878]  877-479-8178.
[02:54:24.898 --> 02:54:32.424]  And Midas Resources has a special, and they are offering anyone who buys more than $3,000 worth of coins from them
[02:54:45.962 --> 02:54:47.263]  A free one-year subscription.
[02:54:48.243 --> 02:54:49.524]  So you should keep that in mind.
[02:54:50.525 --> 02:54:54.307]  All right, so what's that number again to get the free copy?
[02:54:56.529 --> 02:54:58.770]  It's 877-479-8178.
[02:54:59.671 --> 02:55:00.151]  All right.
[02:55:01.151 --> 02:55:02.933]  Let's hope folks take advantage of that.
[02:55:02.973 --> 02:55:05.014]  Let's talk to Bill and Mass.
[02:55:05.054 --> 02:55:05.734]  Go ahead, Bill.
[02:55:06.315 --> 02:55:08.076]  Good afternoon, Alex and Bob.
[02:55:08.456 --> 02:55:09.697]  I'm a little bit confused.
[02:55:09.877 --> 02:55:14.520]  I did some very interesting study in college on...
[02:55:16.147 --> 02:55:22.610]  But lately I've been hearing big concern about where Iraqi oil is sold.
[02:55:22.670 --> 02:55:24.231]  And I always thought it was a commodity.
[02:55:24.311 --> 02:55:28.632]  The same way I used to think that gold was a commodity.
[02:55:29.193 --> 02:55:37.056]  Now, hearing you folks talk, I'm beginning to think of it not so much as a commodity unless it's retraded.
[02:55:37.706 --> 02:55:40.348]  Well, understand that it's done through monopoly.
[02:55:40.668 --> 02:55:44.531]  What we're talking about is, what will the Arabs accept for a currency?
[02:55:44.851 --> 02:55:47.353]  If they won't accept the dollar, that drives it down further.
[02:55:47.393 --> 02:55:47.673]  Bob?
[02:55:49.094 --> 02:55:57.980]  Well, as far as oil is concerned, it goes into the open market, unless it has to be spirited out of the country, which Iraq was doing earlier.
[02:55:58.801 --> 02:56:00.542]  And they also, in the...
[02:56:01.118 --> 02:56:07.704]  And the oil that they were selling officially under sanctions had switched to selling it in the form of euros.
[02:56:08.765 --> 02:56:18.413]  As far as gold being a commodity, yes it is in the sense that it's used in manufacturing, but gold is the oldest money in the face of the earth.
[02:56:19.394 --> 02:56:24.058]  And that's something that I did not learn when I went to Northeastern University.
[02:56:24.759 --> 02:56:25.379]  Where did you go?
[02:56:25.399 --> 02:56:27.341]  University.
[02:56:28.717 --> 02:56:43.182]  But I'm wondering, today in, well, of all places, the Drudge Report, I was reading about the IMF being very concerned about our national debt and how it may be screwing up the world economy.
[02:56:43.855 --> 02:56:46.077]  And I'd like to hear more about that.
[02:56:46.237 --> 02:56:52.863]  What you've been talking about is... Well, that's just good cop... Sir, I read that article in the first hour, and it's on Infowars.com.
[02:56:53.183 --> 02:56:55.685]  That's good cop, bad cop behavior.
[02:56:56.326 --> 02:56:58.968]  The shareholders of Europe are the shareholders of this system.
[02:56:59.228 --> 02:57:01.891]  Bob Chapman, your comments on that?
[02:57:02.031 --> 02:57:10.418]  That's a beautiful answer, because that's exactly what it is, because the IMF and the World Bank are the antithesis of gold.
[02:57:11.548 --> 02:57:16.777]  And they also are the antithesis of solid money.
[02:57:17.638 --> 02:57:19.501]  Solid money would be bankrupt by gold.
[02:57:19.962 --> 02:57:26.032]  I would like to buy some gold, but I'm just afraid that somehow or other, just like guns,
[02:57:26.724 --> 02:57:27.905]  Gold would be taken away.
[02:57:27.945 --> 02:57:28.686]  Well, that's the point.
[02:57:28.746 --> 02:57:31.208]  Hey, don't have children because they can take your children.
[02:57:31.228 --> 02:57:34.791]  Don't walk outside because you might get run over by a car.
[02:57:35.071 --> 02:57:40.495]  That's the point, is that nothing's safe in tyranny, but at least you'll have physical possession.
[02:57:40.896 --> 02:57:42.317]  That's what we've been discussing here.
[02:57:42.337 --> 02:57:43.317]  They can take your stocks.
[02:57:43.338 --> 02:57:44.218]  They can take your bonds.
[02:57:44.538 --> 02:57:45.699]  They can take your bank account.
[02:57:45.739 --> 02:57:46.380]  That's the point.
[02:57:46.700 --> 02:57:47.941]  We're living in tyranny, my friend.
[02:57:47.961 --> 02:57:48.542]  Thanks for the call.
[02:57:49.483 --> 02:57:50.924]  I'm sorry to Scott and others.
[02:57:51.044 --> 02:57:52.586]  Call me back tonight or back tomorrow.
[02:57:52.926 --> 02:57:54.808]  Bob Chapman, thanks for coming on the show.
[02:57:55.268 --> 02:57:56.189]  Please have me back.
[02:57:56.289 --> 02:57:56.649]  I love it.
[02:57:56.890 --> 02:57:57.330]  You bet.
[02:57:57.350 --> 02:58:00.573]  Give folks the number again for the free newsletter.
[02:58:00.854 --> 02:58:05.518]  That number is 877-479-8178.
[02:58:05.738 --> 02:58:06.079]  Alright.
[02:58:06.219 --> 02:58:06.679]  God bless.
[02:58:07.960 --> 02:58:10.803]  Folks, I'm not going to plug my videos this hour.
[02:58:10.843 --> 02:58:11.624]  They're great films.
[02:58:11.644 --> 02:58:12.445]  You want to support us?
[02:58:13.743 --> 02:58:14.324]  You should get them.
[02:58:14.744 --> 02:58:15.585]  They're all excellent.
[02:58:15.685 --> 02:58:21.171]  Well, I'll tell you the websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:58:21.191 --> 02:58:28.680]  You can order them via our secure online shopping cart or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:58:29.461 --> 02:58:30.982]  Get out there and expose evil, folks.
[02:58:31.082 --> 02:58:32.184]  Wake up to the reality.
[02:58:32.624 --> 02:58:33.605]  Get your head out of the sand.
[02:58:33.966 --> 02:58:35.067]  See you back tonight, back tomorrow.
[02:58:37.489 --> 02:58:37.849]  We're good to go.
[02:59:01.587 --> 02:59:02.148]  We're good to go.
[02:59:28.539 --> 02:59:29.080]  Toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:59:29.100 --> 02:59:30.523]  Not yet available in Iowa.
