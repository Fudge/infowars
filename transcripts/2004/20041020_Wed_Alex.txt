[00:00:05.555 --> 00:00:09.736]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:11.197]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.977 --> 00:00:12.777]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.537 --> 00:00:17.178]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.800]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.074 --> 00:00:41.154]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:41.234 --> 00:00:44.875]  It's already Wednesday, the 20th day of October 2004.
[00:00:44.935 --> 00:00:48.797]  Talk about mixed signals.
[00:00:50.237 --> 00:00:54.738]  Dick Cheney is out there saying that terrorists may bomb U.S.
[00:00:54.778 --> 00:00:57.219]  cities with nuclear weapons or dirty bombs.
[00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.300]  He's out fear-mongering again.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.702]  Another senior White House official has been telling newspapers that there's sure to be attacks before the election.
[00:01:06.282 --> 00:01:09.623]  They've said we may have to suspend or
[00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:25.993]  Cancel the elections and we're just twelve days out from the 2004 presidential election and all those other elections that are happening of course on that same day but we're all focused on these two cousins who were members of the same secret society.
[00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:29.196]  So we'll get into Dick Cheney, terrorist, bomb, U.S.
[00:01:29.236 --> 00:01:31.938]  cities and I did dig out that U.S.
[00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:37.302]  News and World Report article I've been talking so much about, thought I might go ahead and re-read
[00:01:38.358 --> 00:01:45.864]  What they had to say there that spurred people like Senator Dayton to evacuate the Capitol.
[00:01:46.904 --> 00:01:59.253]  Also, from the LA Times, the 9-11 secret in the CIA's back pocket, the agency is withholding a damning report that points at senior officials.
[00:02:00.974 --> 00:02:03.877]  And I wanted to read this famous quote by JFK,
[00:02:05.174 --> 00:02:17.877]  The high office of president has been used to foment a plot to destroy Americans' freedom, and before I leave office I plan to inform the citizens of this plight.
[00:02:17.997 --> 00:02:23.238]  John F. Kennedy, 1963, Columbia University, ten days before he was shot.
[00:02:23.298 --> 00:02:29.900]  I just thought it was important to read that every once in a while, an important documented historical quote.
[00:02:30.575 --> 00:02:33.976]  Flat screen TV amidst international distress signal.
[00:02:34.397 --> 00:02:35.837]  This out of Reuters.
[00:02:36.457 --> 00:02:41.239]  They were surprised by the power of the transmitter.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.801]  This guy got a visit from the U.S.
[00:02:44.841 --> 00:02:47.782]  military and the Air Force rescue team.
[00:02:49.643 --> 00:02:53.564]  Just sitting there in his apartment with his new Toshiba flat screen TV.
[00:02:54.164 --> 00:02:54.905]  Speaking of the FCC,
[00:02:56.317 --> 00:03:07.226]  The chairman seeks net telephone oversight and he says it's to maintain the growth of these basically free phone calls.
[00:03:07.947 --> 00:03:09.008]  Sure!
[00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:23.379]  Chairman Michael Powell said yesterday that he would seek broad regulatory authority for the federal government over internet-based telephone services that gives them control over the net, period, to avoid stifling the emerging market.
[00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:25.201]  Yes, we're going to control it and take it over
[00:03:25.982 --> 00:03:30.625]  Make sure you get charged to use it, not to save it.
[00:03:31.365 --> 00:03:33.647]  Isn't that nice of them?
[00:03:34.427 --> 00:03:36.308]  Phone companies are hopping mad.
[00:03:36.328 --> 00:03:41.091]  That's why they're racing ahead with internet too, to regulate and control.
[00:03:41.672 --> 00:03:44.413]  Also, US plane crashes, kills at least eight.
[00:03:44.894 --> 00:03:47.595]  Two people did survive, we'll talk about that.
[00:03:48.556 --> 00:03:51.417]  Police have stun gunned another elderly woman, this time a 75 year old.
[00:03:52.731 --> 00:03:56.113]  At least it wasn't like that 95-year-old a few months ago out in Oregon.
[00:03:56.174 --> 00:03:57.434]  We actually interviewed her daughter.
[00:03:58.835 --> 00:04:01.637]  She just argued with him, so they stun gunned her.
[00:04:02.878 --> 00:04:05.500]  Knocked her fake eye out and beat her up pretty bad.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:16.228]  But hey, you know, 95-year-old women, I'm sorry, she was 94, are very, very dangerous and will have to be dealt with by our saviors in black ski masks.
[00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:39.873]  and also 1.7 million veterans lack coverage despite the fact they were promised lifetime coverage the government said you get nothing and you'll like it and of course just much much more coming up today here on the broadcast and the toll free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231
[00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:53.412]  In the second hour, we'll have a guest on talking about that court ruling with the School of the Americas concerning the Fourth Amendment.
[00:04:54.072 --> 00:04:55.313]  Don't want to miss that as well.
[00:04:56.053 --> 00:04:59.274]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv are the websites.
[00:05:00.943 --> 00:05:02.484]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:02.644 --> 00:05:05.744]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:05.864 --> 00:05:09.765]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:09.805 --> 00:05:14.066]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:05:14.406 --> 00:05:18.187]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.307 --> 00:05:20.167]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.187 --> 00:05:23.628]  A riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:05:23.668 --> 00:05:24.788]  The medical bills!
[00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.372]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.533 --> 00:05:31.577]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:31.757 --> 00:05:34.641]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:41.230]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.535]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:05:45.956 --> 00:05:47.317]  Order your video today.
[00:05:47.698 --> 00:05:48.719]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.

[00:06:11.314 --> 00:06:18.900]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.303]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:06:22.563 --> 00:06:28.305]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:06:28.585 --> 00:06:34.747]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:06:35.107 --> 00:06:38.988]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:06:39.048 --> 00:06:40.929]  The water level is always visible.
[00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:47.073]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:06:47.294 --> 00:06:51.557]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:07:01.067 --> 00:07:02.528]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:10.095]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:07:10.395 --> 00:07:14.819]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:07:15.079 --> 00:07:24.928]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:29.333]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[00:07:29.673 --> 00:07:32.156]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[00:07:32.176 --> 00:07:38.383]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[00:07:38.643 --> 00:07:40.145]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[00:07:40.445 --> 00:07:41.345]  Friends, don't wait.
[00:07:41.425 --> 00:07:44.426]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[00:07:44.586 --> 00:07:47.387]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[00:07:47.427 --> 00:07:51.109]  That's 800-255-1912.
[00:07:51.209 --> 00:07:55.250]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:56.450]  It's powerful stuff.
[00:08:05.513 --> 00:08:06.173]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.834 --> 00:08:07.834]  Mainstream Media.
[00:08:08.593 --> 00:08:09.694]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.354 --> 00:08:11.175]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.935 --> 00:08:12.796]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.816 --> 00:08:17.439]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.679 --> 00:08:21.741]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:30.206 --> 00:08:34.467]  Alright, let's blast through some of the top stories and news and information.
[00:08:34.507 --> 00:08:36.188]  Then your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:36.548 --> 00:08:42.769]  Eric and Bill and Jim, many others, your calls are coming up.
[00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:52.032]  And we'll be talking about the School of Americas and this new 11th Circuit Court, a conservative court ruling that you can't kill freedom in the name of security.
[00:08:52.052 --> 00:08:59.074]  They wanted to turn a whole town into a checkpoint with metal detectors even getting to the town.
[00:08:59.978 --> 00:09:01.680]  And the judge just said, this is ridiculous.
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.662]  It has nothing to do with fighting terrorism.
[00:09:04.163 --> 00:09:07.967]  You're using terrorism as a pretext to shut up a police state.
[00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.932]  But again, that's coming up in the next hour.
[00:09:12.973 --> 00:09:13.313]  U.S.
[00:09:13.394 --> 00:09:16.958]  has contingency plans for a draft of medical workers.
[00:09:18.487 --> 00:09:32.562]  This from the New York Times, the Selective Service has been updating its contingency plans for a draft of doctors, nurses, and other health care workers in a case of a national emergency that overwhelms the military's medical corps.
[00:09:33.954 --> 00:09:48.940]  In a confidential report this summer, a contractor hired by the agency described how such a draft might work, how to secure compliance, and how to mold a public opinion and communicate with health care professionals whose lives could be disrupted.
[00:09:49.961 --> 00:10:02.086]  And not surprisingly enough, of course, it even describes how to not call it a draft, deny there's a draft, even as there is a draft, just like we already have a draft of people who've served five, ten years,
[00:10:02.819 --> 00:10:11.403]  Who's contract is over, who want to leave, and they're told, uh, no, we're going to re-up you for another two years, another two years, another two years.
[00:10:13.304 --> 00:10:14.945]  And that's just the way it is.
[00:10:15.005 --> 00:10:16.365]  You're basically our slave.
[00:10:17.006 --> 00:10:23.589]  How can anybody point at these sailors and airmen and marines and army soldiers?
[00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:32.053]  How can anybody point at these men and women and say, you haven't served, you haven't paid your fair share, you haven't stood up for the homeland?
[00:10:32.791 --> 00:10:38.518]  I mean, we've got a draft of the worst group possible, and they say there's no draft.
[00:10:38.979 --> 00:10:49.132]  And they have all these bills introduced, and they've set up the draft boards again, and they've doubled the funding for selective service, and they've got congressional studies of how a draft is needed.
[00:10:49.172 --> 00:10:50.213]  Bill Clinton did one in 1999.
[00:10:52.848 --> 00:11:00.312]  And I hear every day on the radio, and every time I turn the TV on the last few weeks, it's a conspiracy theory made up by college students.
[00:11:00.353 --> 00:11:01.313]  There are no bills.
[00:11:01.633 --> 00:11:02.654]  There are no plans.
[00:11:03.054 --> 00:11:06.776]  Well, then how did you vote down the bill, one of the bills, two weeks ago?
[00:11:07.497 --> 00:11:11.119]  Four hundred and something to two, if the bills don't exist.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.722]  And again, they're geared up for not just a draft of medical workers.
[00:11:15.742 --> 00:11:17.883]  They're going to have a draft of police.
[00:11:18.732 --> 00:11:25.379]  Firemen, engineers, coroners, nurses, doctors, truck drivers.
[00:11:25.899 --> 00:11:28.542]  That was in the Houston Chronicle almost two years ago.
[00:11:29.002 --> 00:11:30.904]  Now here it is again in the New York Times.
[00:11:33.227 --> 00:11:40.714]  But this is focused specifically on some new memo from a few months ago with Selective Service concerning medical workers.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.542]  So, again folks, we just talk about real things here.
[00:11:45.922 --> 00:11:48.184]  They need a draft to continue what they're doing.
[00:11:48.224 --> 00:11:52.847]  I mean, the Army says they need 400,000 troops to maintain order in Iraq.
[00:11:54.008 --> 00:11:59.792]  They could have gotten order pretty early in the game, and most people there were actually supportive of the invasion.
[00:11:59.832 --> 00:12:03.315]  They didn't like the former puppet our government had put in, Saddam Hussein.
[00:12:05.047 --> 00:12:14.270]  But real quick, when the power didn't go back on and things got worse, and it's gotten far worse, folks, contrary to some of the lies you hear about how it's milk and honey in the streets, it's not.
[00:12:15.711 --> 00:12:31.737]  Now it's blown up in everybody's face, and the globalists don't mind because that'll keep the war going on forever, and they get more no-bid contracts and have an excuse to keep our troops there, but 400,000 troops would have gotten the power back on, would have been able to get the country back operating, but 150,000 just can't do it.
[00:12:35.666 --> 00:12:40.129]  You need $200,000 to do the fighting and $200,000 for support and rebuilding.
[00:12:40.769 --> 00:12:42.590]  I mean, that's just the facts.
[00:12:43.251 --> 00:12:47.494]  So out of that $150,000, we've only got, what, about $30,000 that are actually fighting over there?
[00:12:48.154 --> 00:12:49.955]  That are actually frontline combat soldiers?
[00:12:50.455 --> 00:12:51.276]  It's a joke!
[00:12:54.156 --> 00:12:55.117]  Matt, hey, who cares?
[00:12:55.157 --> 00:12:56.877]  If you're not over there getting shot at, who cares?
[00:12:56.897 --> 00:13:05.922]  Just go eat a hamburger, go swill some beer, go watch the World Series that's coming up, and just suck your thumb and watch your jobs go away, but that's okay.
[00:13:06.182 --> 00:13:07.223]  You can go on welfare.
[00:13:07.243 --> 00:13:11.425]  All right, I've got to hurry here.
[00:13:11.445 --> 00:13:14.746]  I've already spent four or five minutes on the new draft bill.
[00:13:14.846 --> 00:13:16.027]  It's pretty serious stuff.
[00:13:17.228 --> 00:13:19.629]  Putin backs Bush's victory.
[00:13:21.525 --> 00:13:23.746]  Vladimir Putin, a couple days ago, came out.
[00:13:23.826 --> 00:13:25.287]  Oh, I'm sorry I wasn't here yesterday.
[00:13:25.327 --> 00:13:26.708]  I rarely have back pain.
[00:13:26.728 --> 00:13:31.330]  And I woke up yesterday morning at 6am and could hardly get out of bed.
[00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:36.232]  I was literally crawling to the bathtub to take a hot bath and that made it a little bit better.
[00:13:36.252 --> 00:13:40.834]  And then I was getting in my car to go to the studio and it was so painful I just said, forget it.
[00:13:41.655 --> 00:13:46.717]  And I basically hobbled back in the house and took a bunch of Advil and feel a lot better today.
[00:13:47.738 --> 00:13:50.559]  So, trying to get back in the gym, trying to get back in shape.
[00:13:51.138 --> 00:13:53.119]  Things like this happen in the process, I guess.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.481]  So sorry I wasn't here yesterday.
[00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:59.384]  You know, I always try to be here, but I was out of commission.
[00:13:59.404 --> 00:14:18.358]  So we've got yesterday's news and today's news, and it's a lot of it here, but... Fed's mom, or silent on pre-election terror threat, this out of the Associated Press, FBI, Justice Department, and Homeland Security Department officials aren't talking much about the threat of terrorism.
[00:14:19.036 --> 00:14:21.337]  Terrorist attack to disrupt the elections in two weeks.
[00:14:22.337 --> 00:14:23.458]  Now it's 12 days, folks.
[00:14:23.538 --> 00:14:24.538]  It hasn't gone away.
[00:14:24.618 --> 00:14:32.361]  They're just wary of saying anything in public that could prompt Democrats to charge the administration is playing up a terror threat to frighten voters.
[00:14:33.941 --> 00:14:35.262]  Oh no, the Democrats love it too.
[00:14:35.282 --> 00:14:37.203]  They're going to get to control the police state as well.
[00:14:38.303 --> 00:14:39.663]  You're not playing it up.
[00:14:39.964 --> 00:14:42.144]  Cheney terrorist may bomb U.S.
[00:14:42.204 --> 00:14:42.584]  cities.
[00:14:43.225 --> 00:14:46.726]  Associated Press, Carroll, Ohio, Vice President
[00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:52.632]  Dick Cheney said yesterday he raised the possibility of terrorist bombing U.S.
[00:14:52.652 --> 00:15:01.897]  cities with nuclear weapons and questions whether Senator John Kerry could combat such an ultimate threat, you've got to get your mind around.
[00:15:04.418 --> 00:15:05.699]  That was one of his quotes.
[00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:15.845]  The biggest threat we face now as a nation is the possibility of terrorists ending up in the middle of one of our cities
[00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:29.894]  With deadlier weapons that have ever before been used against us, biological agents or nuclear weapons, or a chemical weapon of some kind to be able to threaten the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans, Dick Cheney said.
[00:15:31.134 --> 00:15:36.115]  That's the ultimate threat for us to have a strategy that's capable of defeating the threat.
[00:15:36.476 --> 00:15:39.536]  You've got to get your mind around the concept, Cheney said.
[00:15:40.637 --> 00:15:41.637]  Cheney speaking to an
[00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:54.855]  Invitation-only crowd as he began a bus tour through Republican strongholds in Ohio, said Kerry is trying to convince voters he would be the same type of tough, aggressive leader as President Bush in the fight against terrorism.
[00:15:56.736 --> 00:16:00.837]  And he went on to say that, again, we're on the brink of more terror attacks.
[00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:04.559]  And so I thought I would dig out that U.S.
[00:16:04.619 --> 00:16:09.541]  News & World Report article that I've been talking so much about for a few months ago
[00:16:10.382 --> 00:16:14.405]  Because, again, they're saying Senator Dayton is evil, a coward, is crazy.
[00:16:14.865 --> 00:16:16.826]  He got the same briefing as the rest of us.
[00:16:16.946 --> 00:16:21.409]  Why has he evacuated his office with his staff back to Minnesota?
[00:16:21.429 --> 00:16:27.893]  Oh, because he was given a briefing, he said, saying that there's an imminent threat on the Capitol.
[00:16:28.573 --> 00:16:29.974]  Not a question of if, but when.
[00:16:30.494 --> 00:16:31.695]  He says, what am I supposed to do?
[00:16:31.715 --> 00:16:33.096]  Well, here's from U.S.
[00:16:33.156 --> 00:16:35.898]  News and World Report, way back May 17th,
[00:16:37.074 --> 00:16:41.535]  White House officials say they've got a working premise about terrorism in the presidential election.
[00:16:41.936 --> 00:16:43.396]  Quote, it's going to happen.
[00:16:44.256 --> 00:16:52.979]  We assume, says a top administration official, an attack will happen, this is a quote, an attack will happen leading up to the election, and he added, it will happen here in Washington.
[00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:55.780]  There are two worst case scenarios, the official says.
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:56.160]  The first,
[00:16:58.426 --> 00:17:05.209]  Uh, says an attack on Washington, possibly the capital, which was believed to be the target of the 9-11 jet crash in Pennsylvania, 32.
[00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:10.952]  Smaller but more frequent attacks on the Washington and other major cities leading up to the election.
[00:17:11.392 --> 00:17:16.514]  To prepare, the administration has been holding secret anti-terrorism drills to make sure top officials know what to do.
[00:17:16.954 --> 00:17:21.216]  There was a sense, says one official involved in the drills, of mass confusion on 9-11.
[00:17:21.516 --> 00:17:22.697]  Now we have a sense of order.
[00:17:25.037 --> 00:17:31.719]  And they say, unclear is the political impact, though most Bushies think the election, the nation would rally around the President.
[00:17:31.799 --> 00:17:39.302]  I can tell you one thing, adds the official sternly, we won't be like Spain, which tossed its government days after the Madrid train bombings.
[00:17:40.002 --> 00:17:42.063]  So there they are saying it will happen.
[00:17:43.124 --> 00:17:49.666]  Then under that we have, Homeland Security confirms election day talks, Homeland Security reviewing proposal to postpone election,
[00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:55.644]  And it goes on and on with mainstream news articles posted under that on this data page.
[00:17:55.684 --> 00:17:56.925]  You can go read all that for yourself.
[00:17:57.646 --> 00:18:06.272]  I've even had a national talk show host that I will not name attack me and say, Mr. Jones claims the government's prepared to cancel the election.
[00:18:06.652 --> 00:18:07.893]  What a conspiracy theory!
[00:18:08.853 --> 00:18:12.456]  Mr. Jones also thinks there was government prior knowledge of 9-11.
[00:18:13.016 --> 00:18:15.558]  Mr. Jones keeps claiming there's plans for a draft.
[00:18:15.618 --> 00:18:17.740]  I mean, all of this is public.
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.281]  The government says it.
[00:18:19.321 --> 00:18:19.661]  It's like
[00:18:22.093 --> 00:18:26.255]  2003, January, they introduced Patriot Act II and it doesn't exist.
[00:18:26.895 --> 00:18:29.876]  I and others were attacked as conspiracy terrorists.
[00:18:30.496 --> 00:18:34.978]  John Ashcroft said phantoms of lost liberty that were aiding terrorists, lying about this.
[00:18:35.478 --> 00:18:46.902]  Now the bill's been reintroduced with a national ID card, total information awareness network, and it's even got wording about checkpoints on the highways and byways of the country.
[00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:49.939]  But the border is more open than ever.
[00:18:50.299 --> 00:18:53.481]  I mean, you all heard them say Patriot Act II didn't exist.
[00:18:53.521 --> 00:18:58.343]  Now you've seen it in all the papers where they say it does and you better pass it or the terrorists are going to get you.
[00:18:59.543 --> 00:19:08.768]  I mean, just this bald-faced lying about things that are introduced and things they're doing and then calling us conspiracy theorists is getting ridiculous.
[00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:13.310]  I mean, it's really starting to get stupid.
[00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:28.914]  I try to grasp my mental faculties and bring them to a level where I can possibly articulate just the full magnitude of the lying, the hypocrisy, the evil, the corruption.
[00:19:29.654 --> 00:19:34.756]  What's that syndrome called where hostages and victims join with their captors?
[00:19:35.696 --> 00:19:38.577]  The Stockholm Syndrome?
[00:19:38.597 --> 00:19:39.817]  I mean, that's what America has.
[00:19:39.857 --> 00:19:42.158]  There's that photo of Bush hugging a
[00:19:43.727 --> 00:19:46.629]  9-11 victim's daughter and oh, you know, he cares so much about her.
[00:19:46.649 --> 00:19:52.435]  I mean, I have to look at the photos of the perpetrator hugging one of the victim's family members.
[00:19:52.475 --> 00:19:56.119]  I mean, it just... When you know the truth, this stuff is too rich.
[00:19:56.759 --> 00:19:58.161]  It's too ridiculous.
[00:19:58.661 --> 00:19:59.302]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:02.938 --> 00:20:03.979]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.104]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:20:07.364 --> 00:20:11.510]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:12.771]  So what do you do?
[00:20:13.092 --> 00:20:17.678]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:20:18.138 --> 00:20:20.259]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:20:20.759 --> 00:20:21.660]  Sheltering in Place!
[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:35.466]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[00:21:03.235 --> 00:21:07.516]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[00:21:07.936 --> 00:21:08.636]  It still is!
[00:21:09.412 --> 00:21:12.913]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[00:21:13.233 --> 00:21:15.034]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[00:21:15.614 --> 00:21:17.675]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[00:21:18.215 --> 00:21:20.235]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[00:21:20.635 --> 00:21:28.278]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[00:21:28.658 --> 00:21:32.399]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.

[00:22:27.296 --> 00:22:27.936]  It truly works.

[00:24:03.659 --> 00:24:09.689]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:13.254]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:22.483 --> 00:24:26.468]  Coming up, the 9-11 secret in the CIA's back pocket.
[00:24:26.508 --> 00:24:30.833]  The agency is withholding a damning report that points at senior officials.
[00:24:30.853 --> 00:24:31.974]  That's the LA Times.
[00:24:32.655 --> 00:24:35.798]  Also, flat screen TV emits international distress signal.
[00:24:36.239 --> 00:24:37.220]  That's out of Reuters.
[00:24:38.258 --> 00:24:43.045]  We'll also get into FCC Chairman Powell wants to take over the internet.
[00:24:43.145 --> 00:24:46.470]  We'll show you another way he's trying to get that done.
[00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:47.771]  A U.S.
[00:24:47.852 --> 00:24:50.235]  plane crash killed at least eight people.
[00:24:50.275 --> 00:24:50.575]  A U.S.
[00:24:50.595 --> 00:24:52.298]  commuter plane en route from St.
[00:24:52.358 --> 00:24:54.541]  Louis, Missouri to the town of Kirksville.
[00:24:56.145 --> 00:25:00.068]  In a northern part of the state, a crash killing at least 8 of the 15 on board.
[00:25:00.128 --> 00:25:06.832]  Officials said 2 of the passengers survived the crash and are listed in a local hospital in stable condition, while 5 remain missing.
[00:25:07.372 --> 00:25:13.696]  We are optimistic that we are going to find other survivors, Police Sergeant Brent Bernhardt told NBC News.
[00:25:15.444 --> 00:25:26.129]  The Jetstream 32 twin-engine turboprop plane operated by American Connection, a subsidiary of American Airlines, crashed in the wooded area at about 7.30 p.m.
[00:25:26.169 --> 00:25:30.171]  local time, about six kilometers outside the town of Kirksville.
[00:25:31.332 --> 00:25:32.992]  And again, there's no indication of how that happened.
[00:25:33.372 --> 00:25:37.434]  Let's go ahead and go to your calls, and I'll get back into all the news I've mentioned and a lot more.
[00:25:37.955 --> 00:25:39.896]  Eric in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:25:39.936 --> 00:25:40.656]  Go ahead, Eric.
[00:25:41.249 --> 00:25:43.170]  Hi Alex, so good to talk to you.
[00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:44.590]  Good to talk to you, go ahead.
[00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:45.411]  This is Eric Rainbolt.
[00:25:45.831 --> 00:25:46.551]  Hey, how you doing man?
[00:25:46.771 --> 00:25:48.792]  Good, good to hear from you, good to hear your show.
[00:25:48.812 --> 00:25:51.633]  I've been listening off and on for a while, reading InfoWars.
[00:25:51.733 --> 00:25:53.054]  I haven't called in for a year and a half.
[00:25:53.954 --> 00:26:03.798]  But I have four key points I'd like to express, and I'll go at your pace, but I'd like to talk about each of these big things that I consider for my research.
[00:26:06.772 --> 00:26:11.254]  Right now, I just want to point out, it's 1,129 days since 9-11.
[00:26:11.914 --> 00:26:24.638]  So, I agree with you that Americans have the Stockholm Syndrome, but the Patriots, I think, are also suffering from a little bit of the Boiling Fraud Syndrome, because it's really getting down to the wire, close to the selection time.
[00:26:25.298 --> 00:26:33.261]  Now, again, the Stockholm Syndrome is where people start defending and loving their captors, their slave masters,
[00:26:34.208 --> 00:26:39.490]  And that's what's happening today with George Bush and John Kerry who were puppets for the New World Order.
[00:26:39.991 --> 00:26:41.671]  Yes, skull and bones puppets, exactly.
[00:26:43.012 --> 00:26:51.496]  The first point I'd like to read is the occurrence of the 11 going on and all the dates from September 11, 1990, 11 years to 9-11.
[00:26:52.456 --> 00:26:57.619]  Then 911 days past that was 3-11, that was the Madrid bombing.
[00:26:58.479 --> 00:27:02.661]  There seems to be a definite repetition of 11 and I've done some research, it seems like
[00:27:04.265 --> 00:27:06.246]  The Masons are particularly fond of the number 11.
[00:27:06.286 --> 00:27:09.969]  I have an article on the website 9-11 exposed about that.
[00:27:10.949 --> 00:27:12.310]  And even 9 plus 1 plus 1 is 11.
[00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:13.131]  There's 11's all through it.
[00:27:15.575 --> 00:27:19.838]  So if I was going to predict air dates, I'd predict 10-22, 11-9, because that's 9-11.
[00:27:19.858 --> 00:27:23.381]  Well, several of the flights had 11 in their number.
[00:27:23.401 --> 00:27:27.263]  Yeah, the globalists are really into numerology.
[00:27:27.464 --> 00:27:31.767]  They admit, mainstream, that Skull and Bones is obsessed with numerology.
[00:27:32.367 --> 00:27:40.553]  And these are their own little inside codes to each other, just like Special Forces leaves a death-set card in Vietnam or
[00:27:42.068 --> 00:27:44.869]  You know, serial killers leave their calling cards.
[00:27:44.909 --> 00:27:46.610]  The globalists like to leave their seal.
[00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:47.450]  Exactly.
[00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:49.911]  And 11-11 would be a perfect date for them.
[00:27:50.431 --> 00:27:58.794]  I'll tell you what a big date is, and I'm not predicting anything, but the day after the election, we're looking at 11-3.
[00:27:59.695 --> 00:28:02.216]  Oh, that's very interesting, because 11 times 3 is 33.
[00:28:02.256 --> 00:28:04.157]  33 degree masonry.
[00:28:04.537 --> 00:28:05.477]  So you have it right there.
[00:28:06.037 --> 00:28:06.838]  Precisely, Alex.
[00:28:06.878 --> 00:28:07.418]  I agree with you 100%.
[00:28:08.633 --> 00:28:09.874]  Well, I don't want to make any predictions.
[00:28:09.934 --> 00:28:11.195]  I'm not exposing the globalists.
[00:28:11.215 --> 00:28:12.035]  They might pull something.
[00:28:12.075 --> 00:28:14.076]  But again, I don't believe in the occult.
[00:28:14.437 --> 00:28:16.498]  But the point is, our government does.
[00:28:16.878 --> 00:28:18.119]  The people involved in it.
[00:28:18.179 --> 00:28:23.042]  I mean, the general public knows that most presidents make decisions according to astrologers.
[00:28:23.642 --> 00:28:27.945]  Ronald Reagan wouldn't make any decision unless his astrologer had double-checked it.
[00:28:28.766 --> 00:28:30.667]  With Nancy, that's mainstream.
[00:28:31.307 --> 00:28:35.129]  Hillary's got Shaman up in the top of the White House.
[00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:37.411]  Eleanor Roosevelt doing seances.
[00:28:38.626 --> 00:28:40.807]  Kerry's out being blessed by different groups.
[00:28:41.827 --> 00:28:45.629]  And then you've got Bush, you know, Kerry, they say they share their faith.
[00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:49.690]  Well, they're both members of an admitted satanic order, skull and bones.
[00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:52.131]  Oh yeah, seems all prophetic to me.
[00:28:52.631 --> 00:28:54.412]  I'd like to move on to point number two.
[00:28:54.632 --> 00:28:56.673]  Yeah, go ahead and make your points, because I've got a load of fun lies here.
[00:28:56.713 --> 00:28:56.953]  I know.
[00:28:57.433 --> 00:29:03.755]  The chemtrail conspiracy that's going on that everybody can see in the skies, I think it's related to what the CDC is fear-mongering about.
[00:29:03.775 --> 00:29:06.496]  You had an article called Fear-Mongering for Martial Law, which kind of
[00:29:07.182 --> 00:29:10.746]  Goes along with what you're reading earlier on this show about the medical draft.
[00:29:11.867 --> 00:29:20.135]  All my research points to that the globalists can only win if they release a pandemic plague to get everybody sick and microchipped or possibly just dead.
[00:29:20.155 --> 00:29:28.643]  And which will create such a smokescreen for martial law that we'll accept it and then after the pandemic's been cured, the martial law never goes away.
[00:29:29.244 --> 00:29:30.425]  Yeah, I'd like to finish up with you.
[00:29:30.445 --> 00:29:31.646]  Go ahead and finish up.
[00:29:32.225 --> 00:29:34.325]  Okay, and I need your support on something.
[00:29:34.385 --> 00:29:35.746]  I have a campaign flyer.
[00:29:35.766 --> 00:29:38.946]  There needs to be a massive political transformation in America, obviously.
[00:29:38.986 --> 00:29:41.767]  We can't just sit back and let these tyrants rule all the time.
[00:29:41.847 --> 00:29:42.667]  What's the campaign?
[00:29:42.947 --> 00:29:46.928]  It's called the Tea Party, Total Education Awareness, Illuminati... Okay, what's your website?
[00:29:46.948 --> 00:29:49.028]  Give folks your website.
[00:29:49.288 --> 00:29:50.028]  911exposed.com.
[00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:50.889]  Alright.
[00:29:51.449 --> 00:29:52.369]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.849 --> 00:29:54.449]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.369 --> 00:29:58.050]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.198 --> 00:30:03.740]  How would you like to lose weight 24 hours a day?
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.942]  Now you can with the all new Slim Sculpt weight loss system.
[00:30:07.102 --> 00:30:09.484]  Let your body's metabolism burn the fat for you.
[00:30:09.684 --> 00:30:10.905]  It's fast and easy.
[00:30:11.085 --> 00:30:16.249]  Start with Slim Sculpt's 48 hour diet juice to quickly lose up to 10 pounds in 2 days.
[00:30:16.529 --> 00:30:20.973]  Then take the daily Slim Sculpt tablets to boost your metabolism and curb your appetite.
[00:30:21.153 --> 00:30:24.195]  And use the amazing weight burning cream to sculpt your hips,
[00:30:24.375 --> 00:30:24.995]  We're good to go.
[00:30:50.549 --> 00:31:08.316]  800-275-0359 800-275-0359 800-275-0359 Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:31:08.597 --> 00:31:19.521]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:31:19.781 --> 00:31:21.582]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:31:21.842 --> 00:31:25.163]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:31:25.503 --> 00:31:26.844]  But it's worth every penny.
[00:31:26.984 --> 00:31:35.947]  Because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:31:36.247 --> 00:31:36.768]  That's right!
[00:31:36.928 --> 00:31:44.053]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:31:44.354 --> 00:31:48.477]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[00:31:48.637 --> 00:31:53.101]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:53.141 --> 00:31:53.601]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.287 --> 00:32:03.650]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:07.754]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:32:08.075 --> 00:32:08.876]  Read the labels.
[00:32:09.316 --> 00:32:13.420]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:32:13.661 --> 00:32:17.845]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:32:18.226 --> 00:32:23.111]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:32:23.471 --> 00:32:27.053]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Calbem Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:32:27.234 --> 00:32:32.597]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:32:32.857 --> 00:32:35.599]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:32:35.899 --> 00:32:36.780]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:33:06.101 --> 00:33:08.003]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.483 --> 00:33:11.325]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:12.506 --> 00:33:15.969]  I got a lot of important news, a ton of calls, and a short time to
[00:33:16.812 --> 00:33:18.312]  Cover it all, so-callers.
[00:33:19.293 --> 00:33:24.414]  Let's try to get the info out and move on to the next person quickly with your question or comment or statements you've got.
[00:33:24.914 --> 00:33:25.894]  Bill in Ohio.
[00:33:25.974 --> 00:33:26.834]  Bill, you're on the air.
[00:33:26.914 --> 00:33:27.374]  Go ahead.
[00:33:27.394 --> 00:33:28.015]  How you doing?
[00:33:28.395 --> 00:33:28.875]  Thanks a lot.
[00:33:29.135 --> 00:33:35.876]  Listen, you mentioned some remarks that President Kennedy made about, was it Columbia University?
[00:33:36.096 --> 00:33:36.356]  Yes.
[00:33:36.636 --> 00:33:37.237]  He gave a speech.
[00:33:37.677 --> 00:33:43.098]  I'd like to know where I can get a copy of the text of that speech and also his
[00:33:45.954 --> 00:33:50.499]  Many years ago I actually found that on the university website itself.
[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:52.682]  I've seen it in several history books.
[00:33:54.004 --> 00:33:59.191]  It is a real quote he gave to a large crowd of several thousand students.
[00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:01.932]  Is it still on their website?
[00:34:02.633 --> 00:34:04.234]  Yes, I have seen it over the years.
[00:34:04.414 --> 00:34:17.366]  It says, this is what John F. Kennedy said, the high office of president has been used to foment a plot to destroy the American people's freedom and before I leave office I plan to inform the citizenry of this plight.
[00:34:17.426 --> 00:34:21.930]  John F. Kennedy, 1963, Columbia University, ten days before he was shot dead.
[00:34:22.566 --> 00:34:23.387]  Okay, I'd like to get the
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.141]  Columbia University website.
[00:34:50.221 --> 00:34:51.721]  How do they have that word?
[00:34:51.801 --> 00:34:53.562]  As I said, it's a well-attributed quote.
[00:34:53.602 --> 00:34:54.743]  I just have the quote here today.
[00:34:54.903 --> 00:34:57.044]  I don't have the Columbia University site in front of me.
[00:34:57.984 --> 00:34:58.424]  Okay.
[00:34:58.444 --> 00:35:00.405]  Would it be... Do you have a computer?
[00:35:00.805 --> 00:35:02.266]  Well, I go to the library and use it.
[00:35:02.286 --> 00:35:02.826]  I don't have my own.
[00:35:02.846 --> 00:35:05.467]  Just type Columbia University website into a search engine.
[00:35:05.487 --> 00:35:11.770]  It'll pop up, and then you'll probably need to go into their presidential section, and they've got a lot of quotes there.
[00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:13.510]  But I've seen the quote all over the place.
[00:35:14.251 --> 00:35:14.471]  All right.
[00:35:14.491 --> 00:35:14.911]  Well, thank you.
[00:35:15.371 --> 00:35:15.851]  Anything else?
[00:35:18.055 --> 00:35:23.721]  What about the executive order that he issued to dissolve the Federal Reserve?
[00:35:23.901 --> 00:35:24.762]  That's on the books.
[00:35:24.842 --> 00:35:25.483]  It's like 1-1-1-1-0.
[00:35:25.623 --> 00:35:28.046]  I don't have it in front of me.
[00:35:28.066 --> 00:35:29.047]  It's a whole bunch of ones.
[00:35:29.487 --> 00:35:30.168]  Okay.
[00:35:30.228 --> 00:35:32.470]  Would the Library of Congress website?
[00:35:32.991 --> 00:35:33.491]  Yes.
[00:35:35.193 --> 00:35:37.896]  Just go back to the series that he was in.
[00:35:38.677 --> 00:35:40.699]  Go back to one of the last executive orders he did.
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:41.600]  All right.
[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:42.221]  Thank you very much.
[00:35:42.621 --> 00:35:43.341]  You bet.
[00:35:43.421 --> 00:35:45.603]  Normally, I can commit that to memory, too.
[00:35:46.543 --> 00:35:47.664]  Today, it's failing me.
[00:35:47.924 --> 00:35:50.326]  I'm sure 500 listeners will call in with it now.
[00:35:51.727 --> 00:35:54.349]  Well, I'll just keep listening and maybe I won't have to go to the library.
[00:35:54.409 --> 00:35:54.629]  Yeah.
[00:35:55.649 --> 00:35:56.230]  Thanks a lot.
[00:35:56.410 --> 00:35:56.690]  All right.
[00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:57.611]  Thank you for the call, Bill.
[00:35:58.291 --> 00:36:00.633]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jim in Texas.
[00:36:00.713 --> 00:36:01.573]  Jim, you're on the air.
[00:36:01.653 --> 00:36:02.114]  Go ahead.
[00:36:02.134 --> 00:36:02.974]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:36:03.515 --> 00:36:08.958]  What he said reminded me of something of what I saw searching your website one time about what Abraham Lincoln said.
[00:36:08.978 --> 00:36:10.079]  He was fighting two enemies.
[00:36:10.858 --> 00:36:12.621]  Well, we know the British put troops in Canada.
[00:36:12.641 --> 00:36:14.043]  The British funded the South.
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.001]  And we're planning to break the country up.
[00:36:26.101 --> 00:36:28.643]  And again, I'm not for the North or the South, folks.
[00:36:29.003 --> 00:36:34.526]  My family fought on both sides, on the side of the Confederacy, on my mother's side and my father's side.
[00:36:35.967 --> 00:36:51.976]  And the North was wanting to control Western expansion and dominate the South, but a lot of it was fomented by, as you said, industrialist interest in the North, manipulating from the South with British money.
[00:36:53.336 --> 00:36:56.599]  Well, what I really called about was what you said the other day about toll roads.
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:00.323]  And it made me remember what I saw on the news a couple weeks ago here.
[00:37:00.723 --> 00:37:03.726]  I think it's the loop in Nacogdoches they were talking about they're building.
[00:37:04.147 --> 00:37:11.234]  They said it could take three decades to complete, but if they were allowed to put a toll road up there, it could be finished in seven years.
[00:37:11.294 --> 00:37:12.255]  How wonderful for us.
[00:37:13.539 --> 00:37:21.267]  Well, the entire country, every major highway, state, federal, local road, you'll have a transponder or a satellite tracker box.
[00:37:21.367 --> 00:37:23.509]  All the new cars already have the ignition plug-ins.
[00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:26.012]  And it's now being announced.
[00:37:26.892 --> 00:37:30.196]  Here in Austin, we'll have more toll roads than any other city in the country.
[00:37:31.317 --> 00:37:33.419]  Now 14 major roads and streets.
[00:37:33.899 --> 00:37:37.323]  Already existing roads are just going to plop tolls onto them.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:49.989]  And it'll be a total cage, but it won't just tax the average Austinite $1,800 to $2,000 a year per car, that's the government's own numbers, but it'll also track everywhere you go and what you do.
[00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:57.775]  They also had, they mentioned something about some committee would be appointed to decide what the money would be spent on once the road is paved for.
[00:37:58.769 --> 00:37:59.349]  They're pitiful.
[00:37:59.629 --> 00:38:01.430]  That's all I've got, Alex, and I sure thank you.
[00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:02.530]  Thank you for the call, Jim.
[00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:05.531]  Yeah, they've got the Campo board and they've got the state board.
[00:38:05.551 --> 00:38:06.412]  This is just Texas.
[00:38:06.472 --> 00:38:09.193]  It's, believe me, happening in your area right now, folks.
[00:38:09.353 --> 00:38:15.455]  It's nationwide, but Texas seems to be kind of the jewel in the crown right now, the most advanced of all of this.
[00:38:15.515 --> 00:38:16.875]  And Rick Perry's behind it all.
[00:38:16.935 --> 00:38:22.997]  You're a good little conservative who, of course, was always a Democrat and has one of the most liberal voting records in the state of Texas.
[00:38:23.397 --> 00:38:24.778]  That's why conservatives love him.
[00:38:25.578 --> 00:38:26.318]  Just like Arnold.
[00:38:26.818 --> 00:38:28.099]  Want to use babies for
[00:38:29.108 --> 00:38:37.532]  Medical research, dead babies, want to ban your guns, want to have open borders, want to be for abortion, you love them.
[00:38:39.493 --> 00:38:44.556]  Just Arnold's back at it again, and I talk about Arnold a lot because he's a litmus test or an example.
[00:38:45.036 --> 00:38:53.480]  I've watched Republicans cry, worship him, men with tears in their eyes with their cowboy hats on, as I sat there in the convention hall in Madison Square Garden.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:57.662]  And here he was, more liberal than Bill Clinton, being worshipped!
[00:38:58.715 --> 00:39:00.917]  I don't want to hear it, I better vote for Bush.
[00:39:00.957 --> 00:39:02.659]  I'm not voting for Bush or Kerry.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.241]  I'm going to vote for Michael Perutka.
[00:39:05.621 --> 00:39:15.550]  You know, I said I'm not going to vote because Austin has hard inter-civic electronic machines with no voting record and it's a lot of shady behavior in their past.
[00:39:16.511 --> 00:39:22.917]  But who knows, I'm registered, I'll probably still go vote just so I can report back what the process of voting was like.
[00:39:24.075 --> 00:39:26.617]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ken in Texas.
[00:39:26.697 --> 00:39:27.438]  Ken, you're on the air.
[00:39:27.478 --> 00:39:27.898]  Go ahead.
[00:39:28.058 --> 00:39:28.619]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:39:28.639 --> 00:39:29.920]  This is Ken up in Paris, Texas.
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:32.962]  I just wondered if you got that information I sent you about the department stores?
[00:39:33.222 --> 00:39:33.642]  I did.
[00:39:33.683 --> 00:39:35.804]  You work up at the biggest department store.
[00:39:35.844 --> 00:39:38.526]  Now you've got a thumb scan to clock in and out.
[00:39:38.746 --> 00:39:40.528]  Well, we actually use our index fingers.
[00:39:40.668 --> 00:39:45.051]  We didn't have to actually start the process when I sent the information to you, but we use our index fingers and it's kind of making sense.
[00:39:45.231 --> 00:39:49.252]  For a difficult situation, the electronic machinery doesn't always take our fingerprints.
[00:39:49.332 --> 00:39:50.852]  It should, so we have to go through the process.
[00:39:51.032 --> 00:39:53.573]  The process may be many times over before we can actually clock in.
[00:39:54.273 --> 00:39:58.614]  But we're having to try to work out the bugs, I guess, right now to get it up and functioning, I guess, so to speak, as it should.
[00:39:59.274 --> 00:40:08.096]  But I was going to also ask you if I could today about the situation regarding the major blitz in the airway through the media for people to get their influenza vaccinations, inoculations, etc.
[00:40:08.476 --> 00:40:10.176]  And what your comments would be regarding that, please.
[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:14.922]  Well, again, this is my standard line on this.
[00:40:15.562 --> 00:40:18.823]  You know how every Christmas there's some toy everybody's got to get?
[00:40:19.543 --> 00:40:19.764]  Right.
[00:40:19.804 --> 00:40:21.624]  There's a toy that... Like Tickle Me Elmo.
[00:40:22.124 --> 00:40:23.745]  Like Tickle Me Elmo or whatever it goes by.
[00:40:23.905 --> 00:40:38.311]  Or, you know, 15 years ago it's Cabbage Patch Dolls or... Speaking of Arnold Schwarzenegger, they made a whole movie about a special action figure and then really created a rush on it in the stores.
[00:40:38.631 --> 00:40:40.212]  A whole movie just to sell a toy.
[00:40:41.045 --> 00:40:44.387]  I mean, this is an example of marketing that they use in the flu shot.
[00:40:44.947 --> 00:40:51.150]  If you go back and look at the news wires from last year, at the beginning of last flu season, they claim there was a shortage then.
[00:40:52.470 --> 00:41:06.056]  And then it caused, we now have video from here in Austin, and surrounding towns, of giant lines of people going into the National Guard armories, begging for their flu shot, and magically there just so happens to be enough for them.
[00:41:07.076 --> 00:41:10.178]  And they have lotteries, are you going to get the flu shot?
[00:41:12.593 --> 00:41:17.798]  Again, what they did is a few years ago, so they've created this artificial fad.
[00:41:17.818 --> 00:41:19.199]  They do it every year now.
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:31.469]  This year they claim there's a big shortage because all the flu vaccine that supplies half the country from a British company, their entire supply, half our supply, had live flu virus in it.
[00:41:31.549 --> 00:41:33.731]  And they found this out after the British took the shot.
[00:41:34.338 --> 00:41:41.264]  And now you can read BBC articles about a pandemic of flu all over the country of England.
[00:41:41.725 --> 00:41:43.186]  Thousands of people dying.
[00:41:43.927 --> 00:41:48.371]  And because it's a live flu virus, even if we don't take the shot, it still spreads.
[00:41:48.931 --> 00:41:56.017]  Our webmaster, Paul Watson, had a 104 fever and was literally, two days ago, having hallucinations.
[00:41:56.858 --> 00:41:57.599]  He was so sick.
[00:41:58.386 --> 00:42:00.988]  And so this is all over the country of England right now.
[00:42:01.448 --> 00:42:06.671]  And so some private groups tested it and said it's full of live flu virus.
[00:42:06.711 --> 00:42:08.532]  And so they didn't warn us at first.
[00:42:08.652 --> 00:42:12.254]  Once people exposed it, they withdrew it from the US supply.
[00:42:14.099 --> 00:42:15.800]  And that's what's going on with that.
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:34.808]  They claim two years ago they took the mercury out of the vaccines, but the Associated Press reported, and this is in the vaccine section of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now, that they actually increased it to 250 times safe levels from 100 times safe levels.
[00:42:35.248 --> 00:42:39.490]  And then when we exposed that, they went ahead and came out and just said, mercury is now nutritious for you.
[00:42:40.149 --> 00:42:47.013]  It seems like to me they're trying to basically, exactly, they're trying to use psychological warfare tactics or techniques, so to speak, to get the people to think you have to have it.
[00:42:47.053 --> 00:42:53.096]  There's a scarcity, like you talked about before, artificial scarcity to make people think, oh, we don't have enough, so you better hurry up and get what you can get while you can.
[00:42:53.336 --> 00:42:55.017]  Well, it's like the smallpox shot.
[00:42:55.677 --> 00:43:07.464]  I remember two years ago they said all firefighters and police must take it, and then the LA Times reported that a year into the program, now a year ago, that 99 plus percent
[00:43:10.263 --> 00:43:16.287]  Out of 14 million people in government ordered to take it, less than 1% did take it.
[00:43:17.267 --> 00:43:22.690]  And those that did spread it to friends, live smallpox.
[00:43:23.251 --> 00:43:26.853]  And there were actual smallpox cases because it was live smallpox.
[00:43:27.213 --> 00:43:28.133]  That's how it works.
[00:43:29.114 --> 00:43:34.717]  And so then they couldn't have a controlled release of it because their own enforcers wouldn't take it, but force us to take it.
[00:43:34.737 --> 00:43:35.758]  Well, it's the same thing with the flu.
[00:43:36.802 --> 00:43:51.369]  If you actually look at flu numbers, the numbers of flu deaths, and I have the CDC's own numbers by the way here in front of me on this, from their own website, but they don't really advertise this, flu, since the advent of the flu vaccine, has actually increased in this country.
[00:43:51.909 --> 00:43:56.992]  And so it's not just those that take this, then they spread it to those of us that don't take it.
[00:43:57.612 --> 00:43:59.633]  And again, I rarely get sick.
[00:44:00.234 --> 00:44:04.976]  I had a flu last year, where I was in bed for four days,
[00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:08.910]  And, uh, you know, had a 104 fever.
[00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:12.570]  And, you know, was lying in bed, sweating, talking to myself.
[00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:16.011]  Uh, you know, just completely out of it.
[00:44:16.691 --> 00:44:18.611]  Uh, just a very serious situation.
[00:44:18.932 --> 00:44:22.532]  And I don't know if I caught that from somebody who took the flu vaccine, but it's very suspicious.
[00:44:23.012 --> 00:44:29.894]  Well, it just seems like they're trying to basically make people think you need to hurry up and get your flu vaccination, inoculation before, you know, while you still have a supply left.
[00:44:29.994 --> 00:44:31.094]  I think, like you said before,
[00:44:31.647 --> 00:44:32.288]  I agree with you Ken.
[00:44:32.308 --> 00:44:32.848]  Thanks for the call.
[00:44:32.868 --> 00:44:33.268]  Let me just say this.
[00:45:01.659 --> 00:45:29.948]  I have Henry Kissinger's documents that were declassified in 92 in CIA reports and then issued orders they gave to the five most populous third world countries from Nigeria to China to Brazil and they told them you will forcibly sterilize half your women or you'll get no IMF or World Bank money and I have documents from the fifties and sixties out of Australia where they said we can put
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:33.503]  Stuffing vaccines to sterilize people, and they'll never know it.
[00:45:34.083 --> 00:45:35.244]  That program was carried out.
[00:45:35.324 --> 00:45:36.545]  That's in my film, Rugged Tyranny.
[00:45:37.626 --> 00:45:49.037]  I have, six years ago and then again this year, mainstream news articles coming out in Africa and India where they tested the vaccines and found hormones added to tetanus shots to sterilize the women.
[00:45:49.817 --> 00:45:56.103]  They've caught them putting stuff in the polio and now in the hepatitis shots in the third world.
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.341]  uh... to sterilize people.
[00:45:58.381 --> 00:46:23.150]  We've got Bill Gates and Ted Turner and Prince Philip giving hundreds of millions and in some cases billions of dollars the lion's share of that money going into a global foundation through the WHO the WHO World Health Organization to inoculate the third world and then when you look at these very same people who quote care so much about the children they're writing books and making statements about getting rid of useless eaters
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:26.703]  Coming back as a deadly virus to kill 80% of us.
[00:46:27.503 --> 00:46:28.364]  That's Prince Philip.
[00:46:28.384 --> 00:46:35.751]  Ted Turner made the comment to the National Press Club years ago about the useless eaters and feeders and killing them.
[00:46:36.431 --> 00:46:47.061]  So the very people making these statements are then out making sure that kids get these shots and then, lo and behold, they test it and it's full of stuff that does just what they said they wanted to do.
[00:46:47.757 --> 00:46:49.898]  I mean, it's not hard to figure this out.
[00:46:50.198 --> 00:46:54.459]  I mean, they say they're going to do it, they say they want to do it, and then they do it.
[00:46:54.479 --> 00:46:58.139]  And then we test it, and it's in it, and then we see the repercussions of it.
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:02.280]  How any of you would take any of these vaccines, I'll never know.
[00:47:02.761 --> 00:47:04.261]  Could a vaccine be good for you?
[00:47:04.301 --> 00:47:07.162]  Could a vaccine have healthful benefits?
[00:47:07.202 --> 00:47:08.722]  If it was made properly, certainly.
[00:47:10.262 --> 00:47:11.423]  Hi Alex, how's it going today?
[00:47:11.443 --> 00:47:14.527]  Is there any law that requires you to vaccinate your dog?
[00:47:28.764 --> 00:47:30.105]  Actually, yes, there is.
[00:47:30.205 --> 00:47:35.988]  There is no law that humans have to be vaccinated, though they try color of law and intimidation.
[00:47:36.428 --> 00:47:45.573]  They say, well, it's our policy, you've got to have a shot to go to school, and then we're going to kick you out if you don't have it, then we'll arrest you and your children because you're truant.
[00:47:46.514 --> 00:47:48.575]  When in truth, they have the waiver in their drawer.
[00:47:49.375 --> 00:47:54.598]  With animals, though, they have city and state laws, depending on the area, but everybody basically has it.
[00:47:55.394 --> 00:47:59.177]  Where you've got to have your dog or cat vaccinated to get your yearly tags.
[00:48:00.598 --> 00:48:04.221]  And then if you don't, they can come and fine and fee you or even arrest you in some cases.
[00:48:04.801 --> 00:48:09.105]  So yes, they really have laws that you've got to vaccinate your pets.
[00:48:10.726 --> 00:48:17.872]  Well, that's too bad because I think that all the vaccines are a complete fraud from the research that I've done on them.
[00:48:20.854 --> 00:48:22.035]  Well, I know this.
[00:48:22.899 --> 00:48:23.981]  It's funny you mention this.
[00:48:24.021 --> 00:48:35.440]  You know, I worked for a small animal vet and a large animal vet and the inserts on the vaccines, depending on the vaccine, say every 7 to 10 years, you need to give the dog or cat the different vaccine again.
[00:48:36.777 --> 00:48:44.921]  But the industry tells the American Veterinary Association that, well, even though it says that, we recommend every year.
[00:48:45.381 --> 00:49:00.548]  Then the city passes a law saying that, because they're lobbied by the vaccine maker, who also makes the animal vaccine, makes the human vaccine, and they try to force you to get those tags to do that each year, when their own medical insert says it's not needed.
[00:49:00.988 --> 00:49:08.995]  And then if you think human vaccines are contaminated accidentally, and by the way I think it's on purpose clearly, then the animal vaccines they found to even be dirtier.
[00:49:09.995 --> 00:49:11.456]  I got one more question for you Alex.
[00:49:11.497 --> 00:49:11.797]  Sure.
[00:49:11.917 --> 00:49:22.205]  I was wondering on the amalgam fillings, what's the safe replacement for those being that they contain approximately 50% mercury?
[00:49:25.484 --> 00:49:26.885]  I thought it was a third mercury.
[00:49:27.065 --> 00:49:29.666]  I'm not a dentist, so I don't want to tell you this.
[00:49:29.946 --> 00:49:30.926]  My dad is a dentist.
[00:49:31.927 --> 00:49:36.509]  But they have the composite tooth colored fillings now that are very, very safe.
[00:49:37.069 --> 00:49:41.010]  They're kind of like a plastic slash concrete combination.
[00:49:43.743 --> 00:49:44.704]  That's what they've gone to.
[00:49:44.744 --> 00:49:46.046]  They don't last as long.
[00:49:46.386 --> 00:49:48.749]  You'll have to have them replaced every five years or so.
[00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:51.913]  You drink a lot of orange juice or citrus maybe every two years.
[00:49:53.875 --> 00:49:58.081]  Tell them that you want the composite tooth colored fillings.
[00:49:58.401 --> 00:50:03.027]  Maybe the gold would last longer, but it's kind of a softer material I suppose.
[00:50:03.846 --> 00:50:10.168]  Yeah, but they don't really have the centrifuges and equipment, and they really haven't come out on the market with the gold filling.
[00:50:10.728 --> 00:50:17.751]  I know they have some gold fillings, really small caps, but that's a good idea to market gold fillings.
[00:50:18.351 --> 00:50:19.291]  Yeah, thanks a lot, Alex.
[00:50:19.511 --> 00:50:20.271]  Have a great day there.
[00:50:20.491 --> 00:50:20.872]  You bet.
[00:50:20.912 --> 00:50:23.893]  I appreciate your call, Jerry.
[00:50:24.453 --> 00:50:25.153]  We're going to come back.
[00:50:25.173 --> 00:50:27.794]  I'm going to cover some more news that we haven't gotten to yet.
[00:50:28.655 --> 00:50:37.159]  And we've got a guest scheduled to talk about School of the Americas and this interesting 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling on the Fourth Amendment concerning that.
[00:50:37.779 --> 00:50:39.020]  Some good news for you.
[00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:41.041]  And a lot more.
[00:50:41.061 --> 00:50:44.282]  I will briefly plug my videos when we get back.
[00:50:45.222 --> 00:50:55.107]  And so if you're interested in getting any of my films or any of the films I carry, get your pens and paper ready because I'll plug that in about 60 seconds on the other side and then get into more news.
[00:50:56.204 --> 00:50:56.725]  Stay with us.
[00:50:56.745 --> 00:50:57.486]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:57.887 --> 00:51:00.291]  And don't forget about PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:51:01.252 --> 00:51:05.640]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:10.147]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:14.763]  Use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.783 --> 00:51:17.666]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:51:17.906 --> 00:51:22.151]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.191 --> 00:51:29.139]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.259 --> 00:51:31.282]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.502 --> 00:51:42.124]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.244 --> 00:51:47.625]  If you want to understand what the new old order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:52:00.607 --> 00:52:02.588]  You've asked for them, and now they're here!
[00:52:02.668 --> 00:52:13.373]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:52:13.753 --> 00:52:18.275]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:52:18.335 --> 00:52:29.680]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:37.125]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:52:37.505 --> 00:52:39.646]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:52:40.147 --> 00:52:45.130]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:51.574]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:51.594 --> 00:52:52.695]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:52:52.755 --> 00:52:53.396]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:02.443]  We're good to go.
[00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:18.300]  I think so.
[00:53:40.151 --> 00:53:40.551]  I think so.
[00:54:07.973 --> 00:54:17.536]  Christie Pardue, Communications Coordinator for School of America's Watch will be joining us coming up here in about 10 minutes or so.
[00:54:17.556 --> 00:54:21.098]  We're about to continue with some important news.
[00:54:22.278 --> 00:54:24.859]  But before I do that, again, I've made 11 films.
[00:54:24.919 --> 00:54:26.459]  My 11th film is now out.
[00:54:26.479 --> 00:54:27.380]  It's also out on DVD.
[00:54:28.718 --> 00:54:32.800]  And of course it is American Dictators documenting the staged election of 2004.
[00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:40.424]  And the reason it's important is it will show people the false left-right paradigm and educate them.
[00:54:41.044 --> 00:54:50.349]  And it will show them the big picture and how the candidates are members of the same secret society, how their policies are almost identical, the latest 9-11 developments, Patriot Act 2 information.
[00:54:52.018 --> 00:54:53.179]  It's a great new film.
[00:54:53.759 --> 00:54:58.621]  It's 115 minutes on DVD, 95 minutes on VHS.
[00:54:58.921 --> 00:55:00.122]  $19.95 for one copy.
[00:55:00.562 --> 00:55:03.423]  Each additional copy, if you get it on DVD, is $5.95.
[00:55:03.743 --> 00:55:06.565]  You'll get two copies for $25.95.
[00:55:08.788 --> 00:55:12.732]  And you can get as many as you want for $5.95 after you buy the first one.
[00:55:13.153 --> 00:55:17.897]  Please order 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20 of them, 2 of them, 3 of them, whatever.
[00:55:18.418 --> 00:55:19.879]  Get them out to your friends and family.
[00:55:19.939 --> 00:55:20.820]  Get them out to folks.
[00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:28.367]  And this film will be just as important after the election because it shows people how this Shakespearean theater of an election is carried out.
[00:55:29.218 --> 00:55:35.301]  Then, of course, there's my two 9-11 films, 9-11 The Road to Tyranny and Masters of Terror, I've made.
[00:55:35.321 --> 00:55:39.523]  I also carry George Humphrey's 9-11 film, Eric Hufstra's 9-11 film.

[00:56:07.328 --> 00:56:10.371]  Or just write to me, I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[00:56:15.985 --> 00:56:26.850]  You can also watch all of my videos and a bunch of other films and my weekly TV reports and all my radio interviews and text reports for 15 cents a day at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:27.830]  Sign up today, folks.
[00:56:28.330 --> 00:56:34.613]  Alright, shifting gears back in the news, LA Times, the 9-11 secret in the CIA's back pocket.
[00:56:36.398 --> 00:56:40.360]  The agency is withholding a damning report that points at senior officials.
[00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:41.180]  It is shocking.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:47.103]  The Bush administration is suppressing a CIA report on 9-11 until after the election.
[00:56:47.623 --> 00:56:53.266]  And this one names names, although the report by the Inspector General's office on the CIA was completed in June.
[00:56:53.646 --> 00:56:58.628]  It has not been made available to the Congressional Intelligence Committees that mandated the study almost two years ago.
[00:56:59.688 --> 00:57:08.592]  It is infuriating, the report, which shows that high-level people were not doing their jobs in a satisfactory manner before 9-11, is being suppressed.
[00:57:08.632 --> 00:57:21.779]  An intelligence official who has read the report told me, adding that the report is potentially very embarrassing for the administration because it makes it look like they weren't interested in terrorism before 9-11, or in holding people in the government responsible afterward.
[00:57:22.979 --> 00:57:28.342]  Actually, they gave awards to the members of the FBI and CIA who blocked
[00:57:28.931 --> 00:57:32.333]  Good FBI and CIA agents from stopping Al-Qaeda.
[00:57:32.513 --> 00:57:48.801]  And of course they blocked them because those agents didn't know it was part of a CIA high-level national security drill that the hijackers were actually US government agents taking part in drills that went on for the month of September.
[00:57:49.582 --> 00:57:51.363]  Went on for a month before September 11th.
[00:57:52.771 --> 00:57:58.973]  And, uh, those guys were on those planes and thought they were part of a drill until the nerve gas hit them and then the remote control took over.
[00:57:59.273 --> 00:58:02.833]  We now have this confirmed from multiple high-level sources and it fits all the pieces.
[00:58:03.574 --> 00:58:07.114]  And so, uh, they've had their poor little patsies on board thinking it was part of a drill.
[00:58:08.015 --> 00:58:13.936]  Again, actor James Woods, a week before 9-11, was on board with Muhammad Atta, got off the plane, and so they were simulating hijackings.
[00:58:14.316 --> 00:58:17.857]  The FBI said, we'll arrest you under national security if you tell anybody what you know.
[00:58:19.355 --> 00:58:24.056]  And, uh, by the way, uh, of course we have, uh, Al-Syeda leaving the country to Malaysia.
[00:58:24.076 --> 00:58:26.917]  The government wouldn't let him back in.
[00:58:26.937 --> 00:58:29.138]  They'd be ordered to let him back in from high-level sources.
[00:58:29.158 --> 00:58:30.939]  They were told, quote, it's part of a terror drill.
[00:58:31.959 --> 00:58:34.500]  We've interviewed the former head of the U.S.
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:36.280]  Embassy in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
[00:58:38.141 --> 00:58:38.881]  That's just some of it.
[00:58:38.901 --> 00:58:40.582]  So this new report's a total whitewash.
[00:58:40.882 --> 00:58:45.163]  What they do is block a new report, act like it's bombshell info, bring it out, and it's a whitewash.
[00:58:45.874 --> 00:58:47.195]  Another one of their favorite tactics.
[00:58:47.536 --> 00:58:48.616]  Second hour straight ahead.
[00:58:48.637 --> 00:58:51.599]  Stay with us.
[00:58:51.659 --> 00:58:53.361]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.690 --> 00:58:59.751]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.471 --> 00:59:01.571]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.212 --> 00:59:03.072]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.793 --> 00:59:04.693]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.353 --> 00:59:09.015]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.555 --> 00:59:13.677]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:23.902 --> 00:59:27.564]  Just to illustrate how upside-down things are,
[00:59:28.621 --> 00:59:34.770]  Vladimir Putin came out a few days ago, he then repeated it yesterday, and endorsed George W. Bush.
[00:59:35.992 --> 00:59:43.122]  George says that he's looked into Putin's eyes and saw a man's soul, a man he could trust, a man with a soul of love.
[00:59:44.784 --> 00:59:48.666]  And Vladimir Putin has been caught carrying out terror attacks in his own country.
[00:59:48.747 --> 00:59:49.447]  Confirmed.
[00:59:49.907 --> 00:59:52.849]  Moscow police have caught Putin's FSB.
[00:59:52.909 --> 00:59:55.191]  Putin, former KGB section chief.
[00:59:55.651 --> 00:59:57.192]  They have caught him blowing up buildings.
[00:59:57.232 --> 00:59:59.053]  Caught him putting bombs in a fourth building.
[01:00:01.434 --> 01:00:06.057]  And it's now right out in the open and it's clear that Putin's been carrying out recent terror attacks.
[01:00:06.878 --> 01:00:09.740]  Clearly from the evidence he blew up those aircraft a few weeks ago.
[01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:13.142]  And they had other fake passports drift down from the sky.
[01:00:13.945 --> 01:00:16.246]  Turned out there were passports that hadn't even been issued yet.
[01:00:16.266 --> 01:00:17.146]  It was totally fake.
[01:00:18.247 --> 01:00:20.048]  The school shooting stinks to high heaven.
[01:00:20.068 --> 01:00:21.749]  They had special forces inside doing it.
[01:00:22.089 --> 01:00:23.389]  They admit police had aided them.
[01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:26.931]  Then they escape out the back door, set a bomb off as a diversion.
[01:00:27.451 --> 01:00:32.654]  Then the useful idiots outside are told to open fire on those leaving the building, including men, women, and children.
[01:00:33.474 --> 01:00:42.158]  And now Putin, the guy who has brought back one-party rule, abolished free speech, brought in the regional governors yet again,
[01:00:43.035 --> 01:00:45.077]  He's endorsing George W. Bush.
[01:00:45.418 --> 01:00:48.241]  A few months ago, he said that Saddam did have weapons of mass destruction.
[01:00:48.581 --> 01:00:50.903]  Bush even denies that now and says it never happened.
[01:00:50.923 --> 01:00:51.904]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:00:51.965 --> 01:00:54.047]  It's Buddy Putin, a very trustworthy person.
[01:00:54.467 --> 01:00:56.770]  Again, we're now... See, Putin's now good.
[01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:59.492]  And the sons of Nazis are now our governors.
[01:00:59.613 --> 01:01:03.737]  I mean, it's just getting too rich, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:14.060]  You know, now Putin is this wonderful hero who, by the way, nine months ago put the Red Stars back on the uniforms and back on the tanks and back on the jet aircraft.
[01:01:16.401 --> 01:01:19.863]  So Vladimir Putin, folks, is now going to save us.
[01:01:20.523 --> 01:01:25.646]  He's a wonderful, just a wonderful individual that we should all just be very proud of.
[01:01:26.046 --> 01:01:30.689]  And then, meanwhile, Dick Cheney gives more speeches the last two days saying we're probably going to have nukes go off.
[01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:35.391]  You know, we could have Armageddon if this doesn't happen.
[01:01:37.331 --> 01:01:44.573]  They're just training us to accept fear and accept all of this draconian control.
[01:01:45.073 --> 01:01:48.314]  Meanwhile, the Democrats are engaging in retail election fraud.
[01:01:49.174 --> 01:01:53.995]  They've got Cokeheads registering hundreds of fake people for cocaine.
[01:01:54.895 --> 01:01:56.876]  They've got Mary Poppins registered
[01:01:57.666 --> 01:02:04.348]  Elections officials knew something was wrong when they got voter registration cards for Mary Poppins, Dick Tracy, Michael Jordan, and George Foreman.
[01:02:04.708 --> 01:02:08.188]  That sounds like a Karl Rove type trick so it's so obvious it gets caught.
[01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:14.070]  Karl Rove, the guy that plants fake bugs in his office to beat people in campaigns here in Texas.
[01:02:14.570 --> 01:02:23.532]  They notified the Fiance County Sheriff who arrested Chad Staten on Monday on a felony charge of submitting phony voter registration forms.
[01:02:24.835 --> 01:02:25.856]  We got that type of stuff.
[01:02:26.176 --> 01:02:34.904]  Meanwhile, the real mechanized frauds, Republican-run, with their Diebold companies and others, and they say, just trust us, you know.
[01:02:35.424 --> 01:02:38.186]  How dare you ask for a voting trail?
[01:02:38.827 --> 01:02:43.051]  How dare you ask for a record of how you voted?
[01:02:44.111 --> 01:02:45.773]  Just don't do it.
[01:02:46.874 --> 01:02:47.694]  Just trust us.
[01:02:47.715 --> 01:02:48.775]  You can trust us.
[01:02:51.286 --> 01:02:57.351]  But I get a receipt when I go to an ATM of the grocery store or the cleaners, you know, to pick up a suit.
[01:02:58.432 --> 01:02:59.893]  But why don't I get one for voting?
[01:03:00.573 --> 01:03:06.618]  Why doesn't it just print out how you voted into a big box so we can have a paper recount?
[01:03:07.038 --> 01:03:09.180]  Well, we're sorry, we're just not going to do that.
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:20.849]  But your own engineers have quit and said that it's all a big scam and you have wireless transmitters hooked in and no one's allowed to look under the hood and you've been caught manipulating elections coast to coast and the former CIA director runs
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:22.800]  Your company.
[01:03:24.401 --> 01:03:25.982]  Just shut up and trust us, okay?
[01:03:27.782 --> 01:03:28.823]  Just everything's fine.
[01:03:28.863 --> 01:03:29.663]  Trust us.
[01:03:29.703 --> 01:03:45.049]  When we come back, we'll talk to Christy Pardub with the School of America's watch and this federal court ruling, protesters can't be searched based on terror fears.
[01:03:45.649 --> 01:03:50.731]  Don't forget the websites, InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, Redesigned, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:03:55.350 --> 01:04:00.812]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:04:01.252 --> 01:04:05.793]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:04:05.913 --> 01:04:12.755]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:04:13.135 --> 01:04:19.217]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:04:19.377 --> 01:04:20.597]  There are no side effects.
[01:04:20.937 --> 01:04:23.881]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:04:24.041 --> 01:04:26.063]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:04:26.364 --> 01:04:33.612]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:04:33.913 --> 01:04:37.297]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:05:22.803 --> 01:05:24.664]  That's because it has an elevated base.

[01:05:59.830 --> 01:06:01.211]  That's right folks, DVD.

[01:06:17.522 --> 01:06:28.175]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[01:06:28.335 --> 01:06:30.237]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.262]  And man the guns of the Infowars!
[01:06:34.382 --> 01:06:35.904]  Order right now by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:06:35.924 --> 01:06:36.325]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:06:36.365 --> 01:06:38.768]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[01:06:38.788 --> 01:06:39.850]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[01:06:53.599 --> 01:06:59.205]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:07.232 --> 01:07:11.356]  I like to talk about good news when we can on this broadcast.
[01:07:12.337 --> 01:07:15.721]  I mean overall the good news is that we're waking people up like never before.
[01:07:16.624 --> 01:07:30.713]  That folks are breaking out of the false left-right paradigm and seeing the big picture, how both parties are bought and paid for by the same criminal interests that are not free market, but that are organized crime syndicates bringing you this global government, this new world order.
[01:07:32.194 --> 01:07:38.438]  And again, I like to at least once a week tell you the fact that I keep saying I've done 1,600 interviews.
[01:07:38.538 --> 01:07:40.940]  That's the last time I quit counting.
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.361]  That was a few months ago.
[01:07:42.381 --> 01:07:45.963]  I do several radio interviews on average every day.
[01:07:47.126 --> 01:08:12.707]  uh... in the last three years three-plus years and uh... just last week i was on national british radio and they've even got listeners from their transmitters in europe they took about twenty phone calls and no one called in to disagree with me as i was saying that the military industrial complex carried out nine eleven and the host was attacking me by the way so even on broadcast where the host is against me
[01:08:13.816 --> 01:08:15.438]  Almost everyone calls in agreeing with me.
[01:08:15.898 --> 01:08:17.560]  With these supposed radical statements.
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:21.123]  The Zogby Poll came out during the Republican National Convention.
[01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:22.825]  Highly respected poll.
[01:08:24.286 --> 01:08:28.189]  And half of New Yorkers believe the government was behind 9-11.
[01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:29.851]  68% believe they let it happen.
[01:08:30.972 --> 01:08:35.816]  So, you know, I've sounded pretty wild on 9-11 laying out who I thought was behind it.
[01:08:36.997 --> 01:08:39.540]  And now we have the documents and the evidence and we've proven it.
[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:41.001]  We know who's behind it.
[01:08:42.477 --> 01:08:44.878]  So, yes, we're trailblazers here.
[01:08:44.918 --> 01:08:46.459]  Yes, we say the world is round.
[01:08:46.539 --> 01:08:49.700]  Yes, we point out the horror of the globalists.
[01:08:51.021 --> 01:08:52.761]  But I do have some good news for you.
[01:08:53.182 --> 01:08:55.783]  I'm sure you know about School of America's Fort Benning, Georgia.
[01:08:56.203 --> 01:08:57.243]  And there are other schools.
[01:08:57.883 --> 01:09:11.409]  They're predominantly to train Latin American dictators how to torture people's children in front of their parents, how to hook electrodes to people's private parts, how to arrest the political opposition, how to create fear.
[01:09:13.058 --> 01:09:18.282]  But there are other training camps around the country, in Alabama and other areas, where they train the quote, Muslim terrorists.
[01:09:18.322 --> 01:09:22.286]  I mean, I had articles on that out of the Associated Press ten years ago.
[01:09:22.306 --> 01:09:26.169]  You know, where they train the Republican Guard how to torture people.
[01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:27.590]  I mean, it's all the same stuff.
[01:09:28.791 --> 01:09:34.216]  They train Saddam in 54 how to torture people, and how to bomb, and how to machine gun, and how to assassinate.
[01:09:34.236 --> 01:09:37.578]  And they put him in power in 79, made him the head of security in 67.
[01:09:39.423 --> 01:09:44.666]  So it's the same story whether it's Noriega or whether it's, you know, any of these people.
[01:09:44.706 --> 01:09:46.207]  They put them in and then later take them down.
[01:09:47.447 --> 01:09:50.989]  But the good news is that School of America has had to change their name.
[01:09:52.150 --> 01:09:55.872]  And tens of thousands of people show up every year now for a decade and protest it.
[01:09:57.072 --> 01:10:04.256]  But the town outside of the base now has been trying to set up metal detectors to come into the town, period.
[01:10:04.796 --> 01:10:05.817]  Not the base, the town.
[01:10:06.537 --> 01:10:07.798]  Well, a conservative court
[01:10:09.376 --> 01:10:11.546]  Got past the left-right paradigm a few days ago.
[01:10:12.768 --> 01:10:15.529]  Protestors can't be searched based on terror fears.
[01:10:16.009 --> 01:10:20.591]  Fear of a terrorist attack is not sufficient reason for authorities to search people at a protest.
[01:10:20.931 --> 01:10:25.193]  A federal appeals court has ruled since September 11th cannot be the day Liberty perished.
[01:10:25.613 --> 01:10:27.254]  A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S.
[01:10:27.274 --> 01:10:36.358]  Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously October 15th that protestors may not be required to pass through metal detectors when they gather next month for a rally against the U.S.
[01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:38.639]  Training Academy for Latin American soldiers.
[01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:43.264]  Authorities began using metal detectors at the annual School of America's post.
[01:10:43.764 --> 01:10:49.050]  After the 9-11 terror attacks, the 11th Circuit Court found the practice to violate the First and Fourth Amendments.
[01:10:49.250 --> 01:11:01.322]  Quote, we cannot simply suspend or restrict civil liberties until the war on terror is over because the war on terror is unlikely to ever be truly over, Judge Gerald Tredgeflat, wrote for the panel
[01:11:05.047 --> 01:11:14.235]  In Bourgeoisie versus Peters, September 11, 2001, a day of immeasurable tragedy cannot be a day of liberty perished in this country.
[01:11:15.597 --> 01:11:26.146]  But the mayor of Columbus, Georgia said, well, you've got metal detectors to get into the judges' chambers, or to get into the courtroom, why should we have it for the town?
[01:11:26.186 --> 01:11:28.208]  We've got to protect the protesters and the citizens.
[01:11:28.914 --> 01:11:30.815]  And this argument goes for checkpoints now.
[01:11:31.155 --> 01:11:32.216]  Mind if I search your car?
[01:11:32.316 --> 01:11:33.337]  Well, I have a Fourth Amendment.
[01:11:33.537 --> 01:11:34.417]  What do you have to hide?
[01:11:34.477 --> 01:11:39.360]  Now they come to your door and go, Mind if I search your house for illegal guns?
[01:11:40.101 --> 01:11:41.461]  Well, you have to have a warrant.
[01:11:41.502 --> 01:11:42.922]  Well, what's the probable cause?
[01:11:42.942 --> 01:11:45.104]  Oh, we're just visiting every house in the neighborhood.
[01:11:45.504 --> 01:11:46.004]  Well, no.
[01:11:46.024 --> 01:11:47.025]  Well, what do you have to hide?
[01:11:47.925 --> 01:11:55.330]  And you see, a lot of people on the left, the so-called left, have thought getting rid of the Bill of Rights was all fine and dandy until now it's happening to them.
[01:11:56.030 --> 01:11:57.251]  And then now the neocon
[01:11:58.223 --> 01:12:05.324]  Neo-fascist conservatives all think it's wonderful, and the left is waking up and joining forces with the libertarians and the paleo-conservatives.
[01:12:06.125 --> 01:12:08.545]  But again, I want to thank her for holding the last three or four minutes.
[01:12:09.105 --> 01:12:12.506]  Let's go ahead and go to our guest, who I'm honored to have on with us.
[01:12:13.386 --> 01:12:22.468]  She is the communications coordinator for the organization that has been exposing
[01:12:23.894 --> 01:12:28.435]  The School of America's Watch, and she is Christy Pardue.
[01:12:29.116 --> 01:12:30.356]  Christy, good to have you on with us.
[01:12:30.616 --> 01:12:31.156]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:12:31.236 --> 01:12:32.096]  It's great to be here.
[01:12:32.316 --> 01:12:34.497]  I'm really happy to be sharing some good news for once.
[01:12:34.877 --> 01:12:40.939]  Yeah, it's very good news, and it's S-O-A-W dot O-R-G for the website.
[01:12:41.919 --> 01:12:45.380]  First off, tell us about this ruling by a conservative court.
[01:12:46.212 --> 01:12:49.174]  Well, we've been waiting a long time to get the news of this ruling.
[01:12:49.714 --> 01:12:58.958]  We filed our appeal to the Eleventh Circuit Court two years ago and certainly hope to have the ruling before our annual gathering at the gates of Fort Benning last November.
[01:12:59.379 --> 01:13:15.747]  Didn't hear anything from the court until Friday afternoon when we got the great news that they ruled that these metal detector searches are a violation of both the First and Fourth Amendments of people that are gathering to exercise their First Amendment rights, to exercise their freedom to dissent
[01:13:16.405 --> 01:13:17.366]  At the gates of Fort Benning.
[01:13:17.626 --> 01:13:24.551]  Now the Associated Press admits that literally to go down these streets into the town, they had metal detectors up.
[01:13:24.971 --> 01:13:29.194]  How were they searching tens of thousands of people to get into a town?
[01:13:29.474 --> 01:13:32.837]  Well, very inefficiently, and I think that was very intentional.
[01:13:33.157 --> 01:13:39.901]  They set up a checkpoint about three city blocks from the rally site and forced everyone to funnel through there.
[01:13:40.222 --> 01:13:43.324]  Most of the time they only had two to three aisles open.
[01:13:43.744 --> 01:13:46.806]  So 10,000 people were funneling through two or three aisles.
[01:13:48.127 --> 01:13:51.969]  At times, people were waiting up to two hours simply to enter the rally site.
[01:13:52.069 --> 01:13:57.552]  It was really not only an inconvenience, but we think it actually kept people away from the demonstration site.
[01:13:57.932 --> 01:13:59.873]  Well, obviously, this was the chilling effect.
[01:13:59.893 --> 01:14:05.757]  I mean, we had a lawyer, city employee up in upstate New York, bought a Peace on Earth t-shirt
[01:14:06.796 --> 01:14:17.079]  We interviewed him last year, bought a Peace on Earth t-shirt at the mall and was arrested because, you know, this is a peace shirt, a Christmas shirt, peace, the word peace is evil.
[01:14:17.739 --> 01:14:25.922]  We have federal courts ruling that you can have 200 Bush supporters on a city street, one guy says no blood for oil, they arrest him, he's given a felony conviction.
[01:14:26.402 --> 01:14:30.283]  We have protesters at the Democratic Convention, inside cages, inside cages.
[01:14:30.703 --> 01:14:32.564]  We have New York turned into martial law.
[01:14:32.604 --> 01:14:36.585]  We're AP reporters, American Spectator reporters, liberal, conservative.
[01:14:36.925 --> 01:14:42.587]  I had our cameras taken, cameras filmed, ripped out of them, you know, five miles from the convention center.
[01:14:42.967 --> 01:14:45.168]  This is training us that we have no rights.
[01:14:45.468 --> 01:14:45.688]  Yes.
[01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:56.172]  Two years ago, when they first set up the checkpoints, we certainly saw this as part of a larger pattern of the criminalization of dissent in this country and the crackdown on civil liberties that's happened since 9-11.
[01:14:57.935 --> 01:15:00.098]  But that's why we should all be celebrating this victory.
[01:15:00.179 --> 01:15:01.721]  It's beyond S.O.A.
[01:15:01.761 --> 01:15:02.001]  Watch.
[01:15:02.041 --> 01:15:13.239]  This ruling could have very broad implications, even possibly being used to challenge aspects of the Patriot Act, which is great news for anyone that's struggling for civil liberties and civil rights in this country.
[01:15:13.914 --> 01:15:22.861]  Well, the transportation body now admits that they now don't just search you, they now do the equivalent.
[01:15:22.921 --> 01:15:36.831]  It's been described by the government itself as a physical mammogram check where they admit they really actually... I mean, if I did this to someone on the street, I'd be charged with attempted rape.
[01:15:38.421 --> 01:15:40.502]  But meanwhile, the borders are wide open.
[01:15:40.542 --> 01:15:44.143]  Meanwhile, they're doing nothing to stop the supposed terror threat.
[01:15:44.483 --> 01:15:48.124]  They're doing this everywhere, saying, well, it's a new climate, you've got to give up your rights.
[01:15:48.424 --> 01:15:51.465]  But they're using 9-11 across the board to go after everybody.
[01:15:52.206 --> 01:15:53.086]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:15:53.666 --> 01:16:03.469]  And continuing, we see a crackdown on civil liberties, not just on people who are exercising their rights of defense, but on citizens across the country who maybe don't even consider themselves protesters.
[01:16:05.071 --> 01:16:06.531]  Well, I've certainly experienced it.
[01:16:06.591 --> 01:16:12.533]  I mean, you go out and videotape police running a checkpoint and five years ago they come over and say, what are you doing?
[01:16:12.553 --> 01:16:14.093]  Now they come over and go, turn that off!
[01:16:14.213 --> 01:16:14.493]  Why?
[01:16:14.513 --> 01:16:15.574]  Homeland Security!
[01:16:16.094 --> 01:16:17.514]  Well, you're running the DWI check.
[01:16:17.814 --> 01:16:19.535]  Turn it off or I'm going to arrest you!
[01:16:19.935 --> 01:16:21.015]  Things have changed!
[01:16:21.275 --> 01:16:24.576]  So it's like this atmosphere, this excuse, this pretext.
[01:16:24.956 --> 01:16:25.836]  Yes.
[01:16:25.916 --> 01:16:31.298]  And we've seen the Army using September 11th to justify the School of the Americas and to justify
[01:16:31.959 --> 01:16:32.460]  We're good.
[01:16:41.863 --> 01:16:47.804]  Just using the latest fear-mongering to justify the training that continues to happen within those walls.
[01:16:48.004 --> 01:16:49.764]  Why do you guys focus on Fort Benning?
[01:16:49.784 --> 01:16:59.086]  I mean, obviously it's the biggest in the U.S., but they have other training centers to train the Arabs out of these good little torture masters, to train... I mean, these bases are all over the place.
[01:16:59.566 --> 01:16:59.766]  Right.
[01:17:00.166 --> 01:17:08.568]  We know that the SOA is just one of... the SOA, which is now called the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, or WINSEC, is one of
[01:17:09.227 --> 01:17:15.191]  Over 200 bases and there are 200 training centers in the United States alone where foreign soldiers are trained.
[01:17:15.571 --> 01:17:19.613]  And then that, you know, so many more are trained outside of our borders every year.
[01:17:20.714 --> 01:17:28.378]  Between 2002 and 2003 alone we saw a rise of 52% in the amount of Latin American security personnel who are being trained by U.S.
[01:17:28.398 --> 01:17:28.859]  forces.
[01:17:29.719 --> 01:17:32.701]  We focus on the School of the Americas because
[01:17:33.109 --> 01:17:33.930]  That's where we started.
[01:17:34.010 --> 01:17:37.151]  We started there in 1990 with the first vigil.
[01:17:37.532 --> 01:17:42.855]  We've now, with about a dozen people there, we've now grown to more than 10,000 people who gather there every year.
[01:17:43.415 --> 01:17:49.859]  This school is such a symbol of the fallacy of Latin American foreign military training.
[01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:59.325]  And so, we have so much information about graduates of this school, what they've done when they've returned to their home countries, what they continue to do when they return to their home countries.
[01:17:59.969 --> 01:18:07.755]  We know that shutting down this school will be such a victory and a small step forward in challenging foreign military training in general.
[01:18:09.116 --> 01:18:12.539]  Now, when we get back, I want to talk a little bit about what they do there.
[01:18:12.579 --> 01:18:19.344]  I mean, you know, the training manuals of how to hook the electrodes to someone's parts.
[01:18:20.245 --> 01:18:27.030]  I mean, again, if this is good for us to train the world, then Joseph Mingalo wasn't bad and we've got to embrace Hitler.
[01:18:29.795 --> 01:18:30.596]  Do you get my point?
[01:18:30.636 --> 01:18:36.760]  That, I mean, you know, they're trying to say it's good for us to train the world out of torture, but then we have the devil think that Joseph Mengele was bad.
[01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:37.200]  Right.
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:42.704]  And the SOA is just a small speck in this history of torture training related to the U.S.
[01:18:42.764 --> 01:18:43.284]  military.
[01:18:43.524 --> 01:18:46.947]  Were you aware that Nazis were actually brought here to help set up some of the training?
[01:18:47.267 --> 01:18:47.967]  I certainly was.
[01:18:48.408 --> 01:18:50.209]  Well, we'll talk about that when we get back, folks.
[01:18:51.414 --> 01:18:52.355]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.035 --> 01:18:56.196]  I tried glucosamine for my arthritis, but it didn't help much.
[01:18:56.416 --> 01:18:58.837]  They tell me I just have to put up with my joint pain and stiffness.
[01:18:59.097 --> 01:19:04.259]  Are you doomed to a life of stiff and painful joints or dealing with expensive medications or painful injections?
[01:19:04.419 --> 01:19:05.119]  Well, no more.
[01:19:05.299 --> 01:19:08.240]  I'm pleased to tell you about a totally new product called Injuve.
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:11.681]  Rather than stopping the pain, Injuve attacks the causes of joint pain.
[01:19:12.021 --> 01:19:17.505]  Injuve replenishes what your body was born with by replacing a vital fluid your body loses as you grow older.
[01:19:17.746 --> 01:19:20.287]  It's called hyaluronic acid or HA.
[01:19:20.568 --> 01:19:28.354]  It's important to note that Injuve does not cure arthritis, but it helps reverse the aging process of our joints and reduces the pain and stiffness caused by lack of mobility.

[01:19:54.625 --> 01:20:00.686]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:20:00.946 --> 01:20:02.526]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:20:02.766 --> 01:20:05.207]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:20:05.647 --> 01:20:20.197]  The video, Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:20:20.237 --> 01:20:20.537]  government.

[01:20:52.063 --> 01:20:58.268]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:20:58.728 --> 01:21:06.494]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:21:06.855 --> 01:21:14.701]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:21:15.001 --> 01:21:19.763]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:21:20.103 --> 01:21:24.784]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:21:25.324 --> 01:21:29.166]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:21:29.666 --> 01:21:30.686]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[01:21:51.099 --> 01:21:54.143]  You and your family members getting enough minerals in the daily diet?
[01:21:54.483 --> 01:21:57.026]  It's not likely according to the World Health Organization.
[01:21:57.266 --> 01:21:57.907]  In fact, over
[01:21:57.927 --> 01:22:04.294]  About one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[01:22:04.494 --> 01:22:07.798]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[01:22:08.038 --> 01:22:10.081]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[01:22:10.421 --> 01:22:18.230]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[01:22:18.490 --> 01:22:19.791]  Either way, why chance it?

[01:22:53.112 --> 01:22:55.333]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:22:55.873 --> 01:22:58.774]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:01.755 --> 01:23:08.458]  Your calls for Christy Pardue to talk about the School of America's Abu Ghraib just torture period is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:23:08.618 --> 01:23:11.339]  We'll take your calls for her in the next segment 1-800-259-9231.
[01:23:18.383 --> 01:23:24.812]  Uh, Christy, I've read law enforcement magazines before 9-11 going, actually, torture's pretty good.
[01:23:24.872 --> 01:23:26.214]  We ought to use it in America.
[01:23:26.234 --> 01:23:27.336]  It saves lives.
[01:23:27.416 --> 01:23:28.557]  Torture isn't so bad.
[01:23:28.577 --> 01:23:33.645]  And then, after 9-11, you know, the case for torture, the New York Times, let's use rubber hoses.
[01:23:34.165 --> 01:23:38.267]  Let's put people medically under and stop their hearts till they answer questions.
[01:23:38.607 --> 01:23:46.090]  Then the CIA section chief of the Washington Post said, oh, we take people to third-party countries for torture and we even torture their children in front of them.
[01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:51.892]  I mean, this is a sickening of society that we have this argument of, well, we were attacked on 9-11, are them Arabs?
[01:23:52.292 --> 01:23:54.213]  They torture our people, so they're bad!
[01:23:54.233 --> 01:23:55.013]  Let's torture them!
[01:23:56.952 --> 01:23:59.795]  Then we see the images of Abu Ghraib, but most of them are held back.
[01:24:00.175 --> 01:24:06.001]  They admit Army reports raping children, raping women, arresting families at checkpoints who don't have proper papers.
[01:24:06.722 --> 01:24:07.983]  That's the Army's own report.
[01:24:09.084 --> 01:24:10.486]  Mr. Tugundu's own report.
[01:24:11.787 --> 01:24:13.469]  I mean, this is all
[01:24:15.294 --> 01:24:20.703]  Right out in the open here, and one of the base camps for this type of thinking is School of Americas.
[01:24:21.365 --> 01:24:26.814]  So how do the neocons and others, and you know who you are out there, rationalize torture?
[01:24:28.405 --> 01:24:45.090]  Well, we certainly got torture out in the open back in 1996 when the torture manuals that were used at the School of the Americas were only under intense public grassroots pressure were officials willing to admit that these manuals existed and that they had been used for years at the school.
[01:24:46.212 --> 01:24:48.193]  We saw torture come into the headlines then.
[01:24:48.614 --> 01:24:49.394]  It faded away.
[01:24:49.474 --> 01:24:51.175]  We've seen it come back with Abu Ghraib.
[01:24:51.495 --> 01:25:00.101]  Every time it comes back into the headlines, we hear officials, we hear army officials, elected officials saying, oh, this is just an aberration.
[01:25:00.121 --> 01:25:01.962]  This is just a few bad apples.
[01:25:02.699 --> 01:25:07.643]  But disappearing history is a ruse that is regularly applied to U.S.
[01:25:07.703 --> 01:25:08.484]  foreign policy.
[01:25:08.684 --> 01:25:17.992]  And part of what we do when we gather at the gates of Fort Benning every year is to remember that history and to shine light on it and say, Abu Ghraib was not an aberration.
[01:25:18.092 --> 01:25:21.595]  We saw torture being used across Central America for decades.
[01:25:21.695 --> 01:25:23.597]  We know it was taught here in our own country.
[01:25:23.917 --> 01:25:29.282]  We know that the manuals that were used at the School of the Americas were based on manuals that were developed in Vietnam.
[01:25:29.983 --> 01:25:32.164]  You know, when were those manuals developed?
[01:25:32.184 --> 01:25:33.644]  What's the history of those manuals?
[01:25:34.084 --> 01:25:37.405]  We've seen a long history of torture at the hands of U.S.
[01:25:37.465 --> 01:25:41.806]  military-trained soldiers for decades.
[01:25:41.826 --> 01:25:45.687]  And the birth of this was when the Nazis were brought over.
[01:25:46.588 --> 01:25:53.389]  Literally, folks, Mingela, Barbie, and many lesser-known individuals, they were ensconced at U.S.
[01:25:53.429 --> 01:25:54.470]  military bases.
[01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:59.331]  But can you go over some of the history of what we know about the Nazis and some of their techniques?
[01:26:00.231 --> 01:26:03.574]  I can't speak to that directly with any kind of authority.
[01:26:03.634 --> 01:26:06.937]  I can speak about the manuals that were used at the School of the Americas.
[01:26:07.177 --> 01:26:13.683]  But you've certainly read the mainstream news articles I just mentioned about Nazis helping train some of the people 50 years ago.
[01:26:14.123 --> 01:26:14.323]  Yes.
[01:26:15.184 --> 01:26:17.466]  Well, let's get into these manuals.
[01:26:17.586 --> 01:26:17.766]  Right.
[01:26:18.086 --> 01:26:26.894]  So the manuals that were used at the School of the Americas advocated torture, they advocated blackmail, they advocated the targeting of civilian populations, advocatingating
[01:26:27.392 --> 01:26:33.754]  They advocated targeting people who worked for the rights of the poor, people who said that the government was not doing its job.
[01:26:34.834 --> 01:26:42.677]  And the manuals were based on Army manuals out of a Project X that was created during the Vietnam War.
[01:26:42.697 --> 01:26:48.339]  Those training guides are on file at Fort Huachuca in Arizona.
[01:26:48.859 --> 01:26:55.901]  And a lot of the material in the manuals that was used at the School of the Americas were taken word for word from these Project X training manuals.
[01:26:57.105 --> 01:27:00.348]  Now, without getting too descriptive, we have a lot of children listening.
[01:27:00.508 --> 01:27:02.390]  Let's talk about some of the forms of torture.
[01:27:03.531 --> 01:27:05.493]  It advocated a lot of forms of torture.
[01:27:05.633 --> 01:27:10.578]  A lot of what you hear about in regards to Abu Ghraib, a lot of what you think about when you think about torture.
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:20.186]  Even more problematic was placing that torture in a whole mindset of targeting civilian populations.
[01:27:20.566 --> 01:27:24.669]  That it was completely fine to work outside the rule of law and to target civilians.
[01:27:25.210 --> 01:27:27.711]  And they talk about using terror.
[01:27:27.772 --> 01:27:29.133]  This is something to scare people.
[01:27:29.553 --> 01:27:30.413]  Right, exactly.
[01:27:30.434 --> 01:27:32.255]  It's using terror tactics against people.
[01:27:32.635 --> 01:27:33.195]  We're good to go.
[01:27:50.808 --> 01:28:03.559]  I mean, the Army's own reports say that in Iraq they would set up checkpoints for 32 camps and just pick up whole families and then rape people's wives, beat people's children in front of them.
[01:28:03.899 --> 01:28:08.964]  How in the world can people out there rationalize raping women?
[01:28:09.941 --> 01:28:24.234]  You know, something that we learned from our struggle trying to get these manuals into the public scrutiny, into public light, is that it was only with intense grassroots pressure on Congress people, on the Army, through the media, that any of this came to light.
[01:28:25.009 --> 01:28:26.951]  And, you know, we need that kind of pressure.
[01:28:26.971 --> 01:28:29.613]  We need people pressuring their elected officials.
[01:28:30.093 --> 01:28:36.198]  And we need to step back and look at the big picture of how is torture being used as U.S.
[01:28:36.278 --> 01:28:36.699]  policy.
[01:28:36.719 --> 01:28:38.981]  Well, I thought Saddam was bad because he tortured.
[01:28:39.021 --> 01:28:39.901]  Does that mean we're bad?
[01:28:39.961 --> 01:28:41.202]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.344 --> 01:28:44.305]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.745 --> 01:28:46.407]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.467 --> 01:28:49.970]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.490 --> 01:28:56.734]  Ever walk into someone's house and you can tell instantly they own pets?
[01:28:57.094 --> 01:29:01.759]  They've made the mistake of using a pet odor and stain product that only covers the problem temporarily.
[01:29:01.959 --> 01:29:03.481]  We don't have that problem in our home.
[01:29:03.681 --> 01:29:06.084]  We've discovered it's just better to use PAWS.

[01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:54.452]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:30:54.632 --> 01:30:55.774]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:30:55.954 --> 01:30:59.379]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:30:59.479 --> 01:30:59.899]  Phenol!
[01:31:00.220 --> 01:31:07.309]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:31:07.850 --> 01:31:11.734]  The FDA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:31:11.854 --> 01:31:12.295]  Fragrance?
[01:31:12.675 --> 01:31:17.440]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:22.245]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[01:31:22.485 --> 01:31:24.948]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.

[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:01.563]  The globalists always have their excuses.
[01:32:01.623 --> 01:32:03.786]  Well, we've got to torture because we're fighting communists.
[01:32:04.287 --> 01:32:06.490]  Well, we've got to torture people we're fighting drug dealers.
[01:32:07.296 --> 01:32:08.197]  Oh, we've got a torture.
[01:32:08.677 --> 01:32:09.917]  Now it's we're fighting terrorists.
[01:32:10.058 --> 01:32:11.738]  And then you lead back to the terrorists.
[01:32:11.758 --> 01:32:14.720]  They're always really being protected by the intelligence agencies.
[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:16.061]  They actually work for the globalists.
[01:32:16.501 --> 01:32:18.482]  They create the crisis and then offer the solution.
[01:32:18.982 --> 01:32:32.429]  Saddam Hussein in 1954, when he was 18 years of age, was hired with a group of young Iraqis, brought to Egypt for a year, trained in assassination with knife, with machine gun, with rifle, with plastic explosives.
[01:32:32.489 --> 01:32:34.570]  He went back, was a very successful assassin.
[01:32:35.896 --> 01:32:44.799]  Killing members of the Ba'ath Party, then in the late 1960's he was put in as the head of the security force, and then in 1979 our government helped lead a coup to put him in power.
[01:32:46.079 --> 01:32:48.240]  Then he got over 20 billion dollars in U.S.
[01:32:48.260 --> 01:32:51.421]  funding, he built camps like Abu Ghraib, U.S.
[01:32:51.461 --> 01:33:00.924]  trainers went there, Arab trainees, Republican Guard, by the thousands were trained in torture, and then we just moved back into the buildings we paid for.
[01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:06.724]  And just continue the very torture that was done in Abu Ghraib and 31 other camps.
[01:33:08.285 --> 01:33:11.407]  And I hear these people going, good, torture them, it'll save our troops.
[01:33:11.507 --> 01:33:26.799]  Folks, the army admits, they pull people over at checkpoints, the family doesn't have their papers, they take men, women, and children to the camps, they put them in these big refugee barbed wire camps, and then take them in and randomly, okay, are you with the terrorists?
[01:33:26.979 --> 01:33:27.379]  Uh, no?
[01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:30.742]  Well, here, we're gonna beat your five-year-old up in front of you.
[01:33:32.201 --> 01:33:36.443]  I mean, and these were special federal prison guards they hired from the U.S.
[01:33:36.884 --> 01:33:37.704]  and took over there.
[01:33:38.564 --> 01:33:39.625]  I want you to think about that.
[01:33:39.645 --> 01:33:48.770]  We're going to go to your calls here in a minute or two for our guest, Christy Pardue, Communications Director for School of America's Watch, SOAW.org.
[01:33:49.370 --> 01:33:54.913]  Before I do that, Infowars.net is a news website I have.
[01:33:55.413 --> 01:33:59.575]  We have a lot of people that support us by getting their internet service, their dial-up,
[01:34:00.348 --> 01:34:04.270]  Or, uh, ISDN or DSL through InfoWars.net.
[01:34:04.651 --> 01:34:06.732]  We have the great folks at Rovinet that power it.
[01:34:07.292 --> 01:34:17.918]  We have proxy, you know, servers and proxy, uh, browsers which protect your identity from the globalist spy systems so you can have your Fourth Amendment freedom.
[01:34:18.718 --> 01:34:20.960]  Uh, we, uh, just great prices.
[01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:22.400]  We now have web service.
[01:34:23.761 --> 01:34:25.142]  Believe me, it's top flight.
[01:34:25.672 --> 01:34:30.255]  So if you want to shift your website over or you want to start a website, it starts at $9.95 a month.
[01:34:30.415 --> 01:34:33.116]  I mean, that's just ridiculous, folks.
[01:34:33.737 --> 01:34:39.920]  So go to InfoWars.net and sign up for internet service, high speed, hyper, dial up.
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:41.861]  Which I have.
[01:34:41.941 --> 01:34:43.864]  My cable modem goes down once a month or so.
[01:34:44.584 --> 01:34:45.826]  We just switch over to dial up.
[01:34:45.886 --> 01:34:49.430]  If I had AOL or something, it won't even connect half the time.
[01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:52.854]  But this InfoWars.net service is top flight.
[01:34:52.974 --> 01:34:53.995]  It really loads quickly.
[01:34:54.375 --> 01:34:55.056]  Works great.
[01:34:55.817 --> 01:34:58.920]  So shift to InfoWars.net today.
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:00.983]  Go check it out and see all the hundreds of
[01:35:01.463 --> 01:35:02.845]  Things that it offers.
[01:35:03.165 --> 01:35:04.186]  It's been redesigned.
[01:35:04.246 --> 01:35:06.909]  Now has its own webmaster just for news.
[01:35:07.290 --> 01:35:12.255]  A separate webmaster for the internet service and then online technical support and a phone number.
[01:35:12.715 --> 01:35:13.316]  All of that.
[01:35:13.736 --> 01:35:15.418]  So InfoWars.net.
[01:35:16.179 --> 01:35:17.781]  Going back to Christy Pardue.
[01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:25.504]  Christy, I mean, I know there's a lot here I've covered, but a lot of other areas that you think are important.
[01:35:25.944 --> 01:35:33.108]  What else should we know about the School of Americas and this network of torture training centers around the country?
[01:35:34.369 --> 01:35:37.670]  This school is a military training school for Latin American soldiers.
[01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:42.451]  It's trained over 60,000 Latin American security personnel since it was begun in 1946.
[01:35:42.531 --> 01:35:50.314]  It was initially founded in Panama, but was kicked out of that country under the Panama Canal Treaty and moved to Fort Benning, Georgia in 1984.
[01:35:52.148 --> 01:36:01.396]  The school changed its name in December of 2000, opened in January of 2001 with a new name, the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation.
[01:36:01.416 --> 01:36:07.961]  Essentially the same mission, in the same building, with the same courses and the same instructors and many of the same students.
[01:36:09.022 --> 01:36:14.186]  We don't believe that the school has ever really addressed any of the serious human rights allegations that have been brought against it.
[01:36:14.938 --> 01:36:25.640]  We will gather at the gates of Fort Benning, as we've done every year since 1990, this November, on the anniversary of the murder of six Jesuits, their co-worker, and her daughter in El Salvador in 1989.
[01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:40.322]  We'll gather at the gates of Fort Benning this November 19th through the 21st, and people can check out our website for more information, www.soaw.org, or give us a call in our office at 202-234-3440.
[01:36:44.764 --> 01:36:59.057]  The weekend is an amazing convergence of thousands and thousands of people who come from around the United States and across the Americas to stand up for justice, to say no to torture, to say no to foreign military training with impunity.
[01:37:00.418 --> 01:37:04.822]  There are incredible musicians that join us, rousing speakers from our stage.
[01:37:05.082 --> 01:37:10.807]  We have a funeral procession on Sunday remembering the victims of the graduates of the School of the Americas and the WINSEC.
[01:37:11.810 --> 01:37:14.032]  And I would invite people to join us.
[01:37:14.192 --> 01:37:17.536]  Come check it out if you haven't been before, and come back if you've been in the past.
[01:37:18.356 --> 01:37:22.020]  Now, we're going to take a few calls here.
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:23.441]  Again, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:37:23.481 --> 01:37:25.143]  We're about to go to John and others that are holding.
[01:37:25.863 --> 01:37:32.069]  But Christy Pardue, Communications Director for the School of America's Watch, soaw.org.
[01:37:32.109 --> 01:37:34.331]  We have a link to you, of course, at infowars.com.
[01:37:35.834 --> 01:37:48.559]  Again, the rationale is, well, there might be communists, or there might be Arab terrorists, but then again, time and time again, we see this torture, which isn't good regardless of who you use it on.
[01:37:48.619 --> 01:37:52.320]  I mean, you don't become Joseph Mingala to even fight Joseph Mingala.
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:54.441]  I mean, Joseph Mingala tortured people.
[01:37:54.481 --> 01:37:55.161]  This is wrong.
[01:37:55.241 --> 01:37:56.062]  Torture is bad.
[01:37:56.362 --> 01:37:57.002]  It's immoral.
[01:37:57.562 --> 01:37:59.883]  I mean, most of Christ's disciples were tortured.
[01:38:00.283 --> 01:38:01.143]  Tortured to death.
[01:38:01.524 --> 01:38:03.364]  This is something that bad governments do.
[01:38:03.404 --> 01:38:04.085]  This is something
[01:38:05.911 --> 01:38:11.555]  That is out of control, and to hear it being rationalized and being pushed is disgusting!
[01:38:12.436 --> 01:38:22.763]  And I want people to understand, the Army admits the torture of men, women, and children randomly picked up at checkpoints in Iraq, and these are from other training schools around our country!
[01:38:23.543 --> 01:38:24.644]  And this is shameful!
[01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:31.563]  So how can President Bush say we went in to get Saddam, not because of weapons of mass destruction, but because he tortured people?
[01:38:31.803 --> 01:38:33.023]  Well, he did torture people.
[01:38:33.223 --> 01:38:35.064]  He was trained by the best.
[01:38:35.364 --> 01:38:38.046]  He was trained by our government how to torture.
[01:38:38.066 --> 01:38:43.008]  And when he was a young man, and then in the 70s and 80s, his people were trained in the U.S.
[01:38:43.188 --> 01:38:44.288]  by the tens of thousands.
[01:38:44.328 --> 01:38:45.049]  That is admitted.
[01:38:46.850 --> 01:38:47.070]  Yes.
[01:38:47.530 --> 01:38:49.891]  Well, we know that in their quest for global dominance,
[01:38:50.729 --> 01:38:53.731]  Uh, they're going to use any excuse that they can think of at the time.
[01:38:54.031 --> 01:38:57.032]  Anything that will justify their current actions for domination.
[01:38:57.192 --> 01:38:58.213]  But that's double think.
[01:38:58.533 --> 01:39:00.554]  We're taking over Iraq because they torture.
[01:39:00.974 --> 01:39:02.455]  And by the way, we trained them how to torture.
[01:39:02.775 --> 01:39:02.995]  Yeah.
[01:39:03.555 --> 01:39:05.416]  I mean, it's the same story over and over again.
[01:39:05.436 --> 01:39:07.337]  And folks, I'm talking about
[01:39:08.853 --> 01:39:28.527]  Portraying people's children in front of them, hooking electrodes to people's body parts, breaking fingers, putting people in a steel chair and lowering them into water, putting bags over their heads, and then this leaks into the general culture, and sicko sociopaths that want to do this come back and become your police officers.
[01:39:29.708 --> 01:39:30.708]  So you better watch out.
[01:39:31.089 --> 01:39:32.129]  John in Tennessee.
[01:39:32.229 --> 01:39:33.510]  John, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:39:34.784 --> 01:39:35.064]  Yes.
[01:39:35.465 --> 01:39:40.969]  This year in Clarksville, Tennessee, four cops were fired and indicted for torturing the man in his home.
[01:39:41.389 --> 01:39:48.415]  They used an electric stun gun to electrocute him until he signed a consent form to search his house for drugs.
[01:39:49.256 --> 01:39:54.220]  One of the detectives was the fire chief of the town, but he was not fired from that job.
[01:39:55.341 --> 01:39:59.845]  It appears this was a gang of drug dealing cops just trying to steal drugs or something.
[01:40:00.625 --> 01:40:03.888]  So I suspect they were ex-military who loved this new government
[01:40:04.948 --> 01:40:08.189]  policy of torture at Fort Benning and Abu Ghraib.
[01:40:08.470 --> 01:40:18.874]  Well now, if you sit down the street at a protest, they come over and dump chemicals in your eyes, they sit there stun gunning you over and over again, which they admit can kill you.
[01:40:19.194 --> 01:40:25.256]  They're setting the precedent with non-lethal weapons to train the police to basically torture us in plain view.
[01:40:25.856 --> 01:40:27.677]  Any comments to that, Christy?
[01:40:27.917 --> 01:40:28.257]  I do.
[01:40:28.317 --> 01:40:32.339]  I think, John, that you bring up a really good point, which is the excuse of the drug war.
[01:40:32.799 --> 01:40:49.251]  We're seeing it in our own country and across the Americas and around the world that the government is consistently using the excuse of needing to fight the drug war to funnel money into military training programs that often include the targeting of civilian populations and techniques and torture.
[01:40:49.712 --> 01:40:58.398]  What do you know about the Pristik Institute's briefing lawsuit against the Bush gang in Iran-Contra for murdering American journalists in Central America?
[01:41:00.541 --> 01:41:04.404]  I don't know any specifics about that case, unfortunately, but I'd like to hear more about it.
[01:41:05.045 --> 01:41:17.297]  Well, I mean, with that specific case, let's just fast forward to 2003, even with the Gulf War, the Bush administration comes out publicly, this was in AP, BBC, these are on,
[01:41:18.027 --> 01:41:24.210]  PrisonPlanet.com and a huge section we have and they said, we will kill independent journalists who get in the way.
[01:41:24.230 --> 01:41:30.514]  Then they ordered an Abrams tank to shoot out the seventh floor of the Baghdad Hotel and kill a bunch of Reuters reporters.
[01:41:31.014 --> 01:41:35.837]  They drive up on video and machine gun Reuters reporters that get video of mass graves.
[01:41:36.417 --> 01:41:39.979]  They've killed admittedly over 37 reporters on purpose.
[01:41:40.519 --> 01:41:46.683]  Four reporters in Afghanistan got footage of a mass grave of 3,000 dead Afghans that they just slaughtered.
[01:41:47.123 --> 01:41:49.405]  And so those guys got slaughtered by the globalists.
[01:41:50.346 --> 01:41:53.248]  I mean, they admit now they target reporters.
[01:41:53.348 --> 01:41:53.648]  John?
[01:41:54.628 --> 01:42:04.895]  Well, I mean, that ties into this policy of terrifying the people in Central and South America to drive millions of refugees into America with the borders wide open.
[01:42:05.576 --> 01:42:07.497]  They did the same thing in North Vietnam.
[01:42:08.359 --> 01:42:22.442]  We're sending American Special Forces into there to pretend to be terrorists to drive all the North Vietnamese Catholics into the South and they made the regular population of South Vietnam become the Viet Cong just to get their land back.
[01:42:23.322 --> 01:42:28.363]  So this is a policy of driving millions of people into America to just be here.
[01:42:28.583 --> 01:42:36.085]  By the way, the Pentagon Office of P-2-O-G, two years ago, UPIAP folks, P-2-O-G headline, U.S.
[01:42:36.125 --> 01:42:37.985]  Government Plans to Create Terrorists,
[01:42:38.465 --> 01:42:53.565]  They say, Rumsfeld has a $6 billion a year program, globally, to go out and to kill people, and it goes, we're going to radicalize the radicals and make them attack us so we can expand the war, and Shiites, who were throwing rose petals at us,
[01:42:54.085 --> 01:42:55.927]  Well, when a war drags on and on, there's people making money off of it.
[01:43:14.758 --> 01:43:17.020]  And we can trace that back to their sources.
[01:43:17.541 --> 01:43:23.047]  So we know that war is profitable for a lot of people that are in power today, and for a lot of people that they're indebted to.
[01:43:23.307 --> 01:43:27.412]  And we can common sense look at that, but now we have their own documents!
[01:43:27.432 --> 01:43:29.174]  They don't even hide this anymore, Christy!
[01:43:29.354 --> 01:43:30.255]  Right, exactly.
[01:43:30.635 --> 01:43:34.900]  It's like, we're gonna go over there and have the war go on forever, because we'll make lots of money!
[01:43:38.662 --> 01:43:39.382]  Oh my goodness.
[01:43:39.682 --> 01:43:40.463]  Anything else, John?
[01:43:40.783 --> 01:43:57.569]  Well, here in Knoxville, Tennessee, we've got the Oak Ridge Nuclear Bomb Factory, and protesters out there against the nuclear radiation, they're getting one-year jail sentences for criminal trespass in a federal prison, you know, for stepping across the line.
[01:43:57.609 --> 01:44:02.871]  So I hope you guys are careful down there and play by the rules as much as you can.
[01:44:03.436 --> 01:44:04.936]  Thanks, John.
[01:44:05.216 --> 01:44:09.257]  A lot of the folks that are involved in the Oak Ridge demonstrations are part of SOA Watch as well.
[01:44:09.717 --> 01:44:21.700]  And one of them, Eric Johnson, actually served six months in federal prison two years ago for crossing onto Fort Benning in an act of non-violent civil disobedience calling for the closure of the School of the Americas.
[01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:28.721]  He was given the maximum sentence of six months in federal prison for walking over a line on the ground onto a military base.
[01:44:30.264 --> 01:44:33.087]  And that's certainly been a big part of SOA Watch's history.
[01:44:33.507 --> 01:44:40.753]  There have been over 180 people that have served nearly 79 years in federal prisons around the U.S.
[01:44:40.813 --> 01:44:44.356]  and local jails for their acts of non-violence, civil disobedience at Fort Benning.
[01:44:44.557 --> 01:44:45.577]  John, thanks for the call.
[01:44:46.158 --> 01:44:48.640]  I want this to get through people's noggins out there.
[01:44:49.801 --> 01:44:56.547]  As she said, over 200, I was aware of over 100, but they're the experts, over 200 bases
[01:44:58.772 --> 01:45:17.143]  Where they train Arabs, Asians, Latin Americans, the world, how to hook electrodes up, how to torture people's children in front of them, how to go around, by the way, this is admitted, and they will shoot people and then blame it on the political enemies.
[01:45:17.703 --> 01:45:18.924]  This is one of the old tactics.
[01:45:19.764 --> 01:45:20.825]  And this is what they train them.
[01:45:21.085 --> 01:45:24.527]  Well, you go out and you bomb a bus and then you blame it on your enemies.
[01:45:26.258 --> 01:45:28.660]  I mean, come on, people, and this won't come home to roost.
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:30.742]  It is coming home to roost.
[01:45:30.802 --> 01:45:33.804]  Regina and Pennsylvania, you're on the air with our guest.
[01:45:33.824 --> 01:45:34.585]  Go ahead, Regina.
[01:45:34.785 --> 01:45:35.385]  Yes, your guest.
[01:45:35.425 --> 01:45:38.347]  Could she explain to me what she means by conservative court?
[01:45:38.388 --> 01:45:47.915]  The reason I ask that is because when you say conservative court, then everybody runs down the road and thinks Bush and Rush Limbaugh are saving us, and I sent that article to you, Alex.
[01:45:48.395 --> 01:45:53.119]  Well, I said that, Regina, that the 11th Circuit and these three judges are known as being conservative.
[01:45:53.957 --> 01:45:58.358]  And so it's a good point, and what the judge said, let me read the quote here.
[01:45:58.859 --> 01:45:59.279]  Hold on.
[01:45:59.639 --> 01:46:05.280]  We cannot simply suspend or restrict civil liberties until the war on terror is over, because the war on terror is unlikely ever to be over.
[01:46:05.701 --> 01:46:14.323]  Judge Gerald Togeflat said, already a day of immeasurable tragedy, September 11th cannot be the day liberty perished in this country.
[01:46:14.363 --> 01:46:14.743]  Go ahead.
[01:46:15.083 --> 01:46:17.024]  Well hallelujah, but I think it did perish.
[01:46:17.928 --> 01:46:20.569]  But, you know, praise the Lord that that's happening.
[01:46:20.589 --> 01:46:24.950]  But what I want to bring up to her is an article by Michael Farrell.
[01:46:25.610 --> 01:46:28.131]  He is considered a human rights activist.
[01:46:28.631 --> 01:46:43.476]  I don't know that he'd be considered conservative, but one of the arguments that he is concerned about, and I'd like to know if she has any channel on this, Limbaugh's show is broadcast by the Department of Defense's American Forces Radio and Television Service, AFRTS.
[01:46:44.602 --> 01:46:54.345]  According to its website, its mission is to communicate Department of Defense policies, priorities, programs, goals, and initiatives, and provide stateside radio and television programs to U.S.
[01:46:54.365 --> 01:46:55.265]  servicemen and women.
[01:46:55.645 --> 01:47:03.228]  And this Mike Farrell, it says he's a human rights activist, former Marine, and actor, says that all Americans deplored what happened there.
[01:47:03.648 --> 01:47:05.208]  Well, perhaps not all Americans.
[01:47:05.248 --> 01:47:11.450]  This is in the Tribune Review 7404, and we perhaps, he says,
[01:47:11.894 --> 01:47:13.295]  Let me stop you, Regina.
[01:47:13.375 --> 01:47:16.617]  Yeah, Limbaugh, the ultra-big government pimp of the corporations, is not a real conservative.
[01:47:16.677 --> 01:47:17.578]  In fact, we haven't aired that much.
[01:47:17.598 --> 01:47:18.399]  Can you find that clip, Scott?
[01:47:41.954 --> 01:47:49.058]  We've actually got a clip in the computer of Limbaugh saying that it's just having some fun, blowing off some steam.
[01:47:49.078 --> 01:48:00.903]  I don't know if torturing people to death, to death, I mean if you go out and do that, folks are going to go to prison, you should, but the comments to what Regina is saying, do you have any comments there?
[01:48:01.664 --> 01:48:08.847]  I did just read an article that talked about how the Rush Limbaugh show is being picked up on the military forces radio, but that there is no
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:12.342]  Other kind of alternative viewpoint being given that much time frame.
[01:48:12.802 --> 01:48:13.662]  Well, how do we get it?
[01:48:13.722 --> 01:48:19.466]  What can we do other than send our congressman this article and say, hey, you know, that's what I mean about the conservatives.
[01:48:19.486 --> 01:48:23.828]  As soon as you say conservative, everybody runs to Bush and Rush Limbaugh and thinks they're being saved.
[01:48:24.477 --> 01:48:38.667]  Right, I think it's really important to write letters to your members of Congress, to write letters to the editor of your local paper, and you know, one thing you could do is come join us in November at the gates of Fort Benning and raise your voice with 10,000 other folks who are calling for an end to this.
[01:48:38.847 --> 01:48:40.088]  Regina, thank you for the call.
[01:48:40.128 --> 01:48:40.688]  Anything else?
[01:48:41.629 --> 01:48:47.973]  Just other than keep up the communication, does she know Mike Farrell as far as, you know, where he is in this?
[01:48:48.073 --> 01:48:50.995]  I mean, he obviously wrote a letter about this, an article
[01:48:51.707 --> 01:48:53.408]  And I guess stopping the funding.
[01:48:53.448 --> 01:48:57.610]  The only person I really see, you know, trying to really stop funding is Representative Ron Paul.
[01:48:57.730 --> 01:48:59.351]  And, you know, he gets all the work on this.
[01:48:59.411 --> 01:49:03.072]  And I just wonder, has there been any movement to try to stop the funding?
[01:49:03.092 --> 01:49:04.213]  Thanks for the call, Regina.
[01:49:04.253 --> 01:49:06.474]  That's my final question to you, Christy.
[01:49:06.834 --> 01:49:07.994]  And we appreciate you coming on.
[01:49:08.555 --> 01:49:11.596]  Yeah, it's always Ron Paul, the real conservative helping.
[01:49:11.856 --> 01:49:13.537]  How much help are you getting from Democrats?
[01:49:14.037 --> 01:49:22.281]  Well, Representative McGovern is the sponsor of a bill that we had to try to cut funding for the scholarship for students attending the school last year.
[01:49:22.761 --> 01:49:27.784]  We worked and put a lot of grassroots pressure on members of Congress to get 150 co-sponsors and we couldn't get 150 last year.
[01:49:30.445 --> 01:49:35.709]  Um, we are hoping to bring a bill into Congress this year to win it once and for all to close the school down.
[01:49:36.169 --> 01:49:36.570]  Alright.
[01:49:36.930 --> 01:49:38.251]  Well, it's shameful, folks.
[01:49:38.331 --> 01:49:40.873]  I mean, Joseph Mengele tortures, Saddam tortures.
[01:49:41.373 --> 01:49:42.374]  I thought they were bad.
[01:49:42.955 --> 01:49:45.296]  If we say this is good, then we have to say they're good.
[01:49:45.637 --> 01:49:46.938]  Chrissy, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:49:46.958 --> 01:49:47.498]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:49:47.858 --> 01:49:49.479]  We'll come back and play that Limbaugh clip.
[01:49:53.943 --> 01:49:56.805]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:49:57.526 --> 01:49:58.807]  Alex Jones here, America.

[01:50:18.942 --> 01:50:23.586]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:50:23.686 --> 01:50:26.449]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[01:50:26.749 --> 01:50:29.932]  Psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.

[01:50:59.148 --> 01:51:02.051]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:51:02.131 --> 01:51:08.837]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:51:09.017 --> 01:51:12.040]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.

[01:53:17.419 --> 01:53:18.359]  That's out of Reuters.
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:20.300]  A very suspicious article.
[01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:23.381]  FCC chair to seek net telephone oversight.
[01:53:23.741 --> 01:53:26.062]  They want to take away your free internet telephone calls.
[01:53:27.902 --> 01:53:28.822]  Also, U.S.
[01:53:28.862 --> 01:53:31.103]  plane crash kills at least eight, unfortunately.
[01:53:31.921 --> 01:53:52.054]  and uh... police stunned a gun seventy five-year-old woman wait till you hear why 1.7 million veterans lack health coverage and uh... we'll get into Dick Cheney's latest threats that were you know may have nuke attacks go off here in the next twelve days all of this uh... fear-mongering uh... going on plus more on this L.A.
[01:53:52.074 --> 01:54:00.079]  Times article the 9-11 secret in the CIA's back pocket the agencies were holding a damning report that points at senior officials
[01:54:00.959 --> 01:54:27.788]  and uh... just just just much much much much more uh... coming up in the next hour but again the toll free number to join us 1-800-259-9231 and there's another article out of the New York Times admitting the official plan for a uh... specific draft on people who have special skills and they've geared up for this this is just the department's own own internal documents
[01:54:28.496 --> 01:54:32.642]  Defense Department, excuse me, and how to carry all of this out.
[01:54:32.742 --> 01:54:34.724]  So we'll go over that.
[01:54:34.784 --> 01:54:41.653]  Plus, the FDA is worried about implantable microchips under the skin, so there could be some serious health risks.
[01:54:41.734 --> 01:54:42.615]  But before we
[01:54:43.877 --> 01:54:51.699]  Before we cover all of that, we will of course get to your calls first starting at the start of the next hour at again 1-800-259-9231.
[01:54:52.059 --> 01:55:00.302]  Have your questions and comments ready because I want to take a lot of your calls in rapid succession at a quick pace.
[01:55:00.442 --> 01:55:04.663]  Any issue, any news item you wish to discuss from the upcoming election,
[01:55:05.805 --> 01:55:15.273]  to oil prices over $55 a barrel, to the impending draft and the propaganda surrounding that, all of it in the next hour.
[01:55:16.514 --> 01:55:34.888]  Before I end this hour, I have made 11 films and my 11th film is out, it's American Dictators, documenting the false political left-right paradigm, showing how Bush and Kerry are almost identical on their policies, getting into the latest 9-11 developments, the latest police state developments, interviews with Ron Paul,
[01:55:36.410 --> 01:55:44.034]  Kerry Busey, confrontations with George W. Bush, interviews with Ralph Nader, face-to-face.
[01:55:44.595 --> 01:55:46.256]  All this stuff is in the new film.
[01:55:46.396 --> 01:55:47.296]  I think it's impressive.
[01:55:47.696 --> 01:55:48.877]  A lot of people really like it.
[01:55:49.477 --> 01:55:55.181]  One copy on DVD or VHS is $19.95, but each additional copy on DVD is $5.95.
[01:55:56.282 --> 01:55:58.883]  So buy 5 copies, buy 3 copies, buy 2 copies.
[01:55:59.584 --> 01:56:00.364]  Take advantage of that.
[01:56:00.404 --> 01:56:01.765]  Buy them for roughly $6, under $6 a piece.
[01:56:03.987 --> 01:56:06.030]  And give them to friends and family and neighbors.
[01:56:06.070 --> 01:56:06.972]  Put them on AXS TV.
[01:56:07.272 --> 01:56:08.073]  Get them out to folks.
[01:56:08.354 --> 01:56:16.147]  And long after the election, this will be an important film because it shows people how the elections are nothing more than Shakespearean, thespian events.
[01:56:16.407 --> 01:56:16.728]  Theater.
[01:56:17.089 --> 01:56:17.670]  Roadshows.

[01:57:49.216 --> 01:57:49.896]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.537 --> 01:57:51.517]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.293 --> 01:57:53.393]  Government cover-ups.

[01:58:06.598 --> 01:58:15.040]  A plethora, a cornucopia, a galaxy of important news and information is coming up in this third hour.
[01:58:15.100 --> 01:58:16.781]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:58:17.901 --> 01:58:20.722]  Nick Cheney out, fear-mongering saying brace for nuclear attack.
[01:58:21.596 --> 01:58:23.137]  All the rest of it coming up in the shower.
[01:58:23.157 --> 01:58:24.678]  But first, we've got loaded phone lines.
[01:58:24.698 --> 01:58:26.359]  I want to go to your calls.
[01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:28.821]  Caroline in Missouri, you're on the air.
[01:58:28.861 --> 01:58:29.222]  Welcome.
[01:58:29.242 --> 01:58:29.682]  Go ahead.
[01:58:30.202 --> 01:58:31.003]  Hi, Alex.
[01:58:31.463 --> 01:58:44.753]  Our favorite loud-mouthed, rabid neocon, Michael Savage, is calling for the maximum sentence for these kids that resisted going on that maneuver because they had
[01:58:46.493 --> 01:58:48.074]  I've got a better idea.
[01:58:48.134 --> 01:58:53.855]  How about that dirty, oily beatnik who wrote some of the most unbelievable stuff in the 60s and 70s?
[01:58:54.115 --> 01:58:55.615]  A beatnik leader!
[01:58:57.056 --> 01:58:58.576]  How about that oil ball?
[01:58:58.936 --> 01:59:05.057]  How about he goes out there with broken down trucks to deliver bad fuel to the helicopters?
[01:59:05.278 --> 01:59:07.058]  How about he goes out there without protection?
[01:59:07.968 --> 01:59:10.509]  Oh, I love it when you talk like that, Alex.
[01:59:11.729 --> 01:59:13.230]  But yeah, that's a good question.
[01:59:13.270 --> 01:59:19.251]  I mean, these kids said that they had, you know, just what you said, old Vietnam era stuff that didn't go.
[01:59:19.271 --> 01:59:24.513]  You're not supposed to send fuel convoy trucks unprotected through frontline battle zones.
[01:59:24.593 --> 01:59:28.214]  Every couple days they're blowing up a bunch of them and blowing them to pieces.
[01:59:28.294 --> 01:59:29.174]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:59:30.475 --> 01:59:33.656]  It is ridiculous, and I think these kids have a valid point.
[01:59:33.976 --> 01:59:37.457]  And what do you think of Colorado trying to
[01:59:38.141 --> 01:59:47.288]  I'm sure you've heard of this, I don't know if it's called Prop 36 or Amendment 36, but they want to split the electoral votes.
[01:59:47.388 --> 01:59:51.571]  Like say if Bush got 40%, he'd get 40% of the electoral votes.
[01:59:51.791 --> 01:59:59.036]  You know, I actually believe in the electoral college so a region doesn't become too powerful, the founding fathers knew what they were doing.
[02:00:00.257 --> 02:00:02.339]  What Arnold wants to do is even more dangerous.
[02:00:03.115 --> 02:00:15.964]  Arnold has introduced a Austrian-style, well he's supporting it, a parliamentary system where you can have two people from the same party in runoff elections against each other.
[02:00:16.805 --> 02:00:18.266]  All of this is very dangerous.
[02:00:19.126 --> 02:00:21.548]  And look, I mean, it isn't going to save us.
[02:00:21.928 --> 02:00:23.209]  Kerry isn't going to save us.
[02:00:24.570 --> 02:00:27.452]  I mean, I'm voting for Michael Perudko.
[02:00:27.712 --> 02:00:28.913]  Me too.
[02:00:29.053 --> 02:00:31.555]  I got elected in the party down here in Missouri and
[02:00:32.776 --> 02:00:36.498]  They really are trying very hard to get voters.
[02:00:36.578 --> 02:00:42.121]  By the way, I've been trying to get my good friend, and they're so busy, I guess their phone machines are always full.
[02:00:42.562 --> 02:00:46.464]  I've been trying to get Chuck Baldwin on, I've been trying to get Peruca on for weeks.
[02:00:46.984 --> 02:00:48.665]  It's harder to get them on than to get a U.S.
[02:00:48.685 --> 02:00:49.085]  Senator.
[02:00:49.145 --> 02:00:51.086]  Well, let me see what I can do.
[02:00:51.186 --> 02:00:53.267]  Everybody keeps calling me going, get them on, get them on.
[02:00:53.388 --> 02:00:54.668]  I've left a bunch of messages.
[02:00:54.728 --> 02:00:57.650]  Alex, let me see what I can do.
[02:00:58.317 --> 02:01:00.418]  I'll see if I can get at least one of them on for you.
[02:01:00.638 --> 02:01:02.119]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[02:01:02.179 --> 02:01:02.779]  I appreciate it.
[02:01:03.339 --> 02:01:04.380]  Michael in Georgia.
[02:01:04.460 --> 02:01:05.460]  Michael, you're on the air.
[02:01:05.500 --> 02:01:05.960]  Go ahead.
[02:01:05.980 --> 02:01:07.221]  Hey, good to talk to you, Alex.
[02:01:07.301 --> 02:01:10.202]  I just wanted to inform you of the flip side of the School of the Americas.
[02:01:11.463 --> 02:01:20.866]  Not that there are any, you know, I'm not a pro-advocate for them, but the Jesuits were founded as a police arm of the Catholic Church.
[02:01:22.469 --> 02:01:23.570]  They were sued by the Illuminati.
[02:01:23.610 --> 02:01:25.131]  I don't know if you're aware of that.
[02:01:25.151 --> 02:01:27.412]  They were named originally Los Alambrados.
[02:01:27.733 --> 02:01:30.054]  And the Pope did face, you know, that kind of sounds bad.
[02:01:30.174 --> 02:01:37.600]  Well, again, regardless whether it's communists or Jesuits or Muslims... What's something going on with your phone, bro?
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:39.081]  I have no idea what that is.
[02:01:39.221 --> 02:01:39.621]  Okay.
[02:01:40.762 --> 02:01:46.646]  You know, regardless of what's going on, you don't go out and torture and kill people.
[02:01:47.419 --> 02:01:51.182]  I understand that, but did they torture those six Jesuits?
[02:01:51.282 --> 02:01:53.104]  I don't know, I never heard that as part of the argument.
[02:01:53.284 --> 02:01:58.228]  Oh yeah, they dug up lots of dead bodies all over Latin America with torture all over them.
[02:01:58.268 --> 02:02:01.291]  Right, I understand, but I mean with regard to those six Jesuits.
[02:02:01.331 --> 02:02:15.222]  Look, I have been to the School of the Americas protest, I've infiltrated them, I've put on the grunge, I've warned the blacks, and I've heard them at their tables of Marxist speeches and Marxist books, Mao, Che Guevara, Castro, all the books.
[02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:16.781]  From a bookstore.
[02:02:17.141 --> 02:02:22.846]  Oh, obviously, a lot of people that go to any of these anti-war protests or whatever are going to be communist.
[02:02:23.426 --> 02:02:23.666]  Right.
[02:02:23.686 --> 02:02:26.168]  Well, more than that, this is organized communism.
[02:02:26.188 --> 02:02:28.470]  This isn't just some fly-by-the-way-of-the-night.
[02:02:28.530 --> 02:02:33.634]  This is put out by the Youth Party and the Socialist Workers Party.
[02:02:33.914 --> 02:02:36.416]  This is put out by... Well, see, that's the dialectic.
[02:02:36.577 --> 02:02:42.201]  I mean, the bankers created the communists to begin with, then they build up a police state here to counter it, and it becomes the same thing.
[02:02:42.381 --> 02:02:43.722]  I will infiltrate again this year.
[02:02:43.742 --> 02:02:44.603]  All right, well give us a call.
[02:02:44.663 --> 02:02:50.927]  Maca is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[02:02:51.307 --> 02:02:55.410]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[02:02:55.891 --> 02:03:03.096]  Only recently has science discovered that Maca is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[02:03:03.636 --> 02:03:10.998]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels.
[02:03:11.338 --> 02:03:13.578]  Increased libido, which helps prevent impotence.
[02:03:13.919 --> 02:03:17.179]  Relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort.
[02:03:17.539 --> 02:03:20.720]  Helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and night sweats.
[02:03:21.020 --> 02:03:23.941]  It also helps prevent osteoporosis and joint pain.
[02:03:24.441 --> 02:03:29.547]  Get your mock-up from Cliff Scott Enterprises at a price and quality that few can match.
[02:03:29.707 --> 02:03:32.591]  Because we get our mock-up fresh from the growers in Peru.

[02:04:48.781 --> 02:04:53.204]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:04:53.344 --> 02:04:57.727]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:04:57.767 --> 02:04:59.108]  The New World Order.
[02:04:59.908 --> 02:05:00.268]  Hammered!
[02:05:00.889 --> 02:05:05.111]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.

[02:05:25.083 --> 02:05:30.607]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:05:49.176 --> 02:05:49.797]  Big Brother.
[02:05:50.478 --> 02:05:51.499]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:52.240 --> 02:05:53.341]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.002 --> 02:05:54.823]  You want answers?
[02:05:55.583 --> 02:05:56.484]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.145 --> 02:06:00.789]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.330 --> 02:06:05.414]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:09.347 --> 02:06:11.188]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:06:11.748 --> 02:06:12.368]  until 2 p.m.
[02:06:12.428 --> 02:06:13.408]  Central Standard Time.
[02:06:13.448 --> 02:06:15.389]  We're here live and back from 9 to midnight.
[02:06:15.889 --> 02:06:18.430]  We don't just go out of our wonderful AM and FM affiliates.
[02:06:18.450 --> 02:06:32.493]  We also simulcast on Global Shortwave during the day at 9.475 and at night 9 to midnight Central at 3210 and of course at InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:33.414 --> 02:06:37.815]  We have redesigned and revamped InfoWars.net so check it out today.
[02:06:39.048 --> 02:06:41.069]  Coming up, Cheney, terrorists may bomb U.S.
[02:06:41.089 --> 02:06:41.870]  City with nukes.
[02:06:42.210 --> 02:06:43.410]  And I want to go back to that U.S.
[02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:47.112]  News & World Report article I've been talking so much about and read some of the quotes.
[02:06:48.093 --> 02:06:49.754]  Also, as I mentioned earlier, U.S.
[02:06:49.934 --> 02:06:52.495]  has contingency plans for draft of medical workers.
[02:06:52.976 --> 02:06:54.336]  Oh, but there's no plan for a draft.
[02:06:55.017 --> 02:06:56.298]  That's the New York Times.
[02:06:56.818 --> 02:07:01.040]  Also, Verichip and the health problems associated with it from the FDA's own documents.
[02:07:01.761 --> 02:07:04.082]  RFID coming to a library near you.
[02:07:05.416 --> 02:07:08.558]  Putin backs President Bush for a presidential victory.
[02:07:08.618 --> 02:07:10.459]  Putin's a good guy, folks, they say.
[02:07:10.479 --> 02:07:12.120]  Of course he's not.
[02:07:12.601 --> 02:07:14.042]  Gulf War Syndrome does exist.
[02:07:14.602 --> 02:07:21.907]  This side of the London Independent, and much more, and of course Mark and Thomas and Ryan and many, many others that are patiently holding.
[02:07:22.267 --> 02:07:23.688]  We'll get to you here in just a few minutes.
[02:07:24.729 --> 02:07:28.831]  Right now, Debbie Mauro, New Millennium Concepts, joins us at least once a week.
[02:07:29.332 --> 02:07:31.313]  It's always good to have Debbie on with us.
[02:07:32.349 --> 02:07:38.892]  There's mercury, there's Prozac, there's Ritalin, there's herbicides, there's pesticides, there's sodium fluoride.
[02:07:39.352 --> 02:07:46.156]  Why would any of you not get a high-quality black berkey element, a new standard in water purification, not just filtration?
[02:07:46.516 --> 02:07:50.778]  Why would you not get the little sports bottles that clean out almost all the pathogens?
[02:07:50.798 --> 02:07:57.721]  They're not as good, of course, as the big berkey itself, but it's good to take to work and school and for your children when they're at school.
[02:07:59.088 --> 02:08:02.911]  Why would you not get their Sheltering in Place DVD produced by U.S.
[02:08:02.931 --> 02:08:03.772]  government specialists?
[02:08:04.253 --> 02:08:08.416]  Why would you not get the Proven Places CD-ROM CD?
[02:08:09.397 --> 02:08:14.562]  Why would you not get the potassium iodide in case there is a radiological event so you can protect yourself and your family?
[02:08:15.383 --> 02:08:17.545]  But again, forget all the threats of terrorism.
[02:08:18.266 --> 02:08:22.790]  The ongoing New World Order terrorism against us and our families is happening through the water supply.
[02:08:23.709 --> 02:08:29.633]  Which is totally toxified, and even if you drink the chlorinated water, it kills the bacteria.
[02:08:30.073 --> 02:08:35.756]  When it does kill them, you're still drinking millions of dead bacteria, which is very toxic for you.
[02:08:36.457 --> 02:08:39.698]  That's the equivalent of little pieces of rotten meat, folks.
[02:08:39.718 --> 02:08:40.859]  I'm not trying to gross you out.
[02:08:41.299 --> 02:08:42.060]  Well, actually I am.
[02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:44.461]  I mean, it is gross.
[02:08:45.042 --> 02:08:48.003]  Let's just say it's unintentional, but it's just the facts.
[02:08:48.063 --> 02:08:49.384]  You need to get this.
[02:08:49.584 --> 02:08:50.745]  And it's made in America.
[02:08:51.205 --> 02:08:52.206]  Very rare thing.
[02:08:53.010 --> 02:08:59.233]  They employ people in America and why Debbie's right here in America, right here in Texas.
[02:08:59.253 --> 02:09:00.534]  Debbie, good to have you on with us.
[02:09:00.894 --> 02:09:01.595]  Hi there, Alex.
[02:09:01.715 --> 02:09:03.175]  Thank you for having me.
[02:09:03.536 --> 02:09:03.876]  You bet.
[02:09:03.896 --> 02:09:04.516]  It's a pleasure.
[02:09:04.936 --> 02:09:07.978]  Tell folks briefly about the Black Berkey, this new standard.
[02:09:08.658 --> 02:09:21.125]  Well, you know, the Black Berkey filters were developed in America and we actually get them right here, like you were saying, and the incredible thing about the Black Berkey filters is they take
[02:09:21.738 --> 02:09:46.959]  The whole gravity water filter industry to another level because they do take out the pathogenic bacteria, spruce parasites, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, all the way down to the low detectable levels, which means that when they look under the electron microscope, there's absolutely nothing growing, you know, in those categories.
[02:09:47.643 --> 02:09:54.989]  And, you know, the Black-Berkey filter, it is a very slow process as far as, you know, the water seeps through the filters.
[02:09:55.549 --> 02:09:58.372]  That has all these, you know, millions of pours.
[02:09:58.492 --> 02:10:01.194]  And the key is, how many gallons is the reservoir?
[02:10:01.774 --> 02:10:03.235]  It holds two and a half gallons.
[02:10:03.396 --> 02:10:08.219]  Okay, now the key is, if you want it to go fast, when it gets halfway down, pour more water in.
[02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:09.500]  That speeds it up.
[02:10:09.801 --> 02:10:13.984]  Absolutely, because the more head pressure you have on it,
[02:10:14.591 --> 02:10:15.912]  The faster it will drip.
[02:10:15.932 --> 02:10:27.338]  Now again, you go spend $200 at a hardware store, or at a Kammock Supply Store, or a health food store, it'll be some knockoff from India, and why it'll do a gallon in an hour!
[02:10:27.798 --> 02:10:29.439]  Because it's not doing anything.
[02:10:29.859 --> 02:10:32.401]  It filters out some of the bacteria, some of the big things.
[02:10:32.741 --> 02:10:34.682]  It doesn't filter out the chemicals, folks.
[02:10:35.042 --> 02:10:38.264]  That's why the Black Berkey filters slowly.
[02:10:39.004 --> 02:10:40.605]  What are we looking at, a couple gallons a day?
[02:10:41.201 --> 02:10:45.065]  Well, no, actually, it makes enough water.
[02:10:45.105 --> 02:10:49.389]  It does about a gallon every hour and a half, if you have it full.
[02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:53.413]  And then once you get to know your Berkey, I mean, you never run out of water.
[02:10:54.855 --> 02:10:59.099]  I have used my Burkey on a daily basis for over six years now.
[02:10:59.119 --> 02:11:00.941]  And it does tens of thousands of gallons.
[02:11:01.361 --> 02:11:08.188]  $1.99 to get the black Burkey light without the built in LEDs that burn for 14 years.
[02:11:08.989 --> 02:11:12.072]  For $2.59 you get it with that built in and two free gifts.
[02:11:12.592 --> 02:11:18.375]  The shelter in place CD or VHS and the potassium iodate or a sports bottle.
[02:11:18.395 --> 02:11:19.036]  Mix and match.
[02:11:19.376 --> 02:11:20.777]  They got a sports bottle specials.
[02:11:20.857 --> 02:11:22.238]  Five sports bottles for $99.
[02:11:22.438 --> 02:11:24.739]  Three of them will cost you at the store.
[02:11:25.259 --> 02:11:27.140]  That just makes the water drinkable.
[02:11:27.180 --> 02:11:29.922]  It is not the purifier, my friends.
[02:11:30.082 --> 02:11:31.983]  It's called the purifier but it's like all the other filters.
[02:11:32.043 --> 02:11:33.084]  It just cleans it up.
[02:11:33.184 --> 02:11:34.405]  It's small, great system.
[02:11:35.465 --> 02:11:36.486]  Pond water, whatever.
[02:11:36.506 --> 02:11:38.808]  600 and something refills out of tap water.
[02:11:38.828 --> 02:11:40.750]  130 out of the lake or stream water.
[02:11:41.190 --> 02:11:42.011]  Great to get that.
[02:11:42.111 --> 02:11:43.051]  Great Christmas gifts.
[02:11:43.452 --> 02:11:50.197]  Give Debbie a call right now at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:11:50.257 --> 02:11:51.598]  That's 1-888-803-4438.
[02:11:52.719 --> 02:11:59.385]  Or Berkeywater.com online and type in that Alex Jones sent you and what free gift you want to take advantage of that special.
[02:12:00.625 --> 02:12:02.906]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:12:02.986 --> 02:12:10.349]  And if you call and the phone's busy and it goes to voicemail, leave your name and number, Debbie will call you right back.
[02:12:10.369 --> 02:12:10.549]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:12:10.889 --> 02:12:11.910]  Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[02:12:11.930 --> 02:12:12.970]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:12:13.150 --> 02:12:13.610]  Take care.
[02:12:13.870 --> 02:12:15.071]  Always good to hear from you.
[02:12:15.111 --> 02:12:18.032]  And let's say you've already got one, you're impressed with it, buy some as gifts.
[02:12:18.052 --> 02:12:18.652]  That's what I do.
[02:12:19.652 --> 02:12:23.114]  I think I've now this year bought, what, four of them from them?
[02:12:23.134 --> 02:12:24.514]  I just bought two more a few months ago.
[02:12:25.835 --> 02:12:26.655]  It's important.
[02:12:27.392 --> 02:12:30.933]  And after you've been drinking filtered water for a while, try drinking the tap water.
[02:12:30.973 --> 02:12:31.653]  See the difference?
[02:12:31.693 --> 02:12:33.073]  It's sick.
[02:12:33.673 --> 02:12:36.774]  How bad it tastes.
[02:12:36.794 --> 02:12:37.074]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:12:37.194 --> 02:12:38.714]  Okay, right to the calls.
[02:12:38.754 --> 02:12:39.294]  Thanks for holding.
[02:12:40.034 --> 02:12:40.954]  Mark in Rhode Island.
[02:12:41.014 --> 02:12:41.814]  Mark, you're on the air.
[02:12:41.854 --> 02:12:42.295]  Go ahead.
[02:12:43.255 --> 02:12:44.075]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:12:44.155 --> 02:12:44.535]  Good, sir.
[02:12:45.515 --> 02:12:55.477]  Did you by any chance, Alex, happen to see, you probably didn't, but, Game 6 of the American League Championship Series last night between the Yankees and the Red Sox?
[02:12:55.697 --> 02:12:56.637]  No, I didn't see that.
[02:12:57.145 --> 02:13:00.207]  Okay, let me just tell you what transpired.
[02:13:00.227 --> 02:13:07.052]  It was in the later innings and there was a couple of controversial calls during the ball game.
[02:13:08.674 --> 02:13:13.537]  So the New York fans were getting pretty disgruntled and upset and they were throwing things on the field.
[02:13:13.557 --> 02:13:14.358]  You know how they behave.
[02:13:15.959 --> 02:13:21.203]  So what they did was the umpires started pulling the players off the field and they brought out about
[02:13:22.375 --> 02:13:27.117]  Oh, it had to be 40 or 50 riot police in full riot gear and lined them along the sides of the stand.
[02:13:30.219 --> 02:13:31.599]  Well, I'll have to say this.
[02:13:33.160 --> 02:13:45.646]  You have peaceful protests and they call them out and they beat up innocent people, but frankly, one of the places I would expect to see them is after big championship football or baseball games because that's when you really do have riots.
[02:13:46.346 --> 02:13:47.587]  We're turning into animals.
[02:13:47.607 --> 02:13:49.128]  This didn't happen decades ago.
[02:13:49.888 --> 02:13:52.471]  And people don't care about their families or anything else.
[02:13:52.491 --> 02:13:53.612]  They just care about sports.
[02:13:54.053 --> 02:13:59.018]  And so they simulate tribal warfare at these games, and that's the place I'd expect to see them.
[02:13:59.338 --> 02:14:02.541]  Now at the Super Bowls, they have the army and the troops and the helicopters.
[02:14:02.962 --> 02:14:05.424]  That's to train us to accept the end of Posse Comitatus.
[02:14:05.444 --> 02:14:06.245]  That's a bad thing.
[02:14:07.140 --> 02:14:11.183]  But frankly, with the way fans have been behaving, I don't overall blame them.
[02:14:11.643 --> 02:14:16.787]  Though now, we've interviewed people who somebody yells at someone at a game and is now arrested.
[02:14:17.267 --> 02:14:19.528]  So they're definitely overreacting.
[02:14:19.989 --> 02:14:20.749]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:14:20.869 --> 02:14:30.956]  But I want to know why they've got cops at little bitty protests here in Austin that'll start fights with people and there's no history of that, but then no cops out, you know, at a UT Championship football game.
[02:14:30.996 --> 02:14:32.597]  I mean, it doesn't make sense.
[02:14:33.318 --> 02:14:35.179]  Well, and the second part of this is that
[02:14:35.683 --> 02:14:58.842]  This morning when I was listening to the radio and the news, the sports network, and they were talking about it, they said, oh, and by the way, if something happens to take place in Game 7, they said that with the level of sophistication of technology that the police have as evidence of what happened in New York City at the Republican National Convention, they said they will be prepared for everything
[02:14:59.426 --> 02:15:00.086]  And anything.
[02:15:00.447 --> 02:15:01.967]  And I just thought that was very interesting.
[02:15:02.007 --> 02:15:04.689]  Well, that means they've got the sound wave and microwave guns.
[02:15:04.729 --> 02:15:05.149]  Exactly.
[02:15:05.409 --> 02:15:07.050]  And I know they've got face scanning cameras.
[02:15:07.090 --> 02:15:07.710]  Thanks for the call.
[02:15:07.830 --> 02:15:08.230]  Thank you.
[02:15:08.550 --> 02:15:10.871]  Yeah, I will not go to a major sporting event.
[02:15:14.233 --> 02:15:15.334]  I mean, I love sports, too.
[02:15:15.354 --> 02:15:17.455]  You know, I played football, baseball, all of it.
[02:15:17.495 --> 02:15:19.475]  But there's things that are too serious.
[02:15:19.495 --> 02:15:25.018]  You know, it's like, I won't talk about Bill O'Reilly and his sexual harassment case.
[02:15:25.098 --> 02:15:26.019]  Oh, it's very interesting.
[02:15:26.039 --> 02:15:26.899]  People like to talk about it.
[02:15:27.563 --> 02:15:29.464]  We got Cheney saying nukes may go off.
[02:15:29.484 --> 02:15:31.966]  We got him telling the Capitol that it will be attacked.
[02:15:32.006 --> 02:15:34.488]  We've got, you know, wide open borders.
[02:15:34.848 --> 02:15:36.769]  We've got cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[02:15:36.789 --> 02:15:43.594]  You know, we've got all these massive... A national ID card has now passed the House and Senate and is in conference committee about to go to the President.
[02:15:45.195 --> 02:15:45.655]  I'm sorry.
[02:15:45.675 --> 02:15:46.856]  I just cannot get into it.
[02:15:47.496 --> 02:15:48.557]  Thomas in Indiana.
[02:15:48.617 --> 02:15:49.458]  Thomas, you're on the air.
[02:15:49.498 --> 02:15:49.798]  Welcome.
[02:15:50.238 --> 02:15:50.718]  Hello, Alex.
[02:15:50.898 --> 02:15:51.339]  How you doing?
[02:15:51.559 --> 02:15:51.779]  Good.
[02:15:52.339 --> 02:15:54.561]  I just want to tell you, you're doing a wonderful job, but
[02:15:55.529 --> 02:16:14.926]  I don't believe that we have the capabilities, Alex, to defeat these gurus that you talk about on the radio all the time, because I know that we have to inform everybody, but I'm a devout Christian man, and I truly believe that Jesus Christ is coming soon, Alex, and I believe that the only thing we have in hope is Jesus Christ.
[02:16:16.328 --> 02:16:19.850]  Well, it's a complex question and complex statement and all I can say to you is this.
[02:16:19.870 --> 02:16:21.371]  If four thugs were attacking and killing an old woman,
[02:16:40.945 --> 02:16:44.926]  And I had a 99% chance of losing and being killed going up against him.
[02:16:45.607 --> 02:16:47.007]  I couldn't control myself.
[02:16:47.547 --> 02:16:48.328]  It's my nature.
[02:16:48.348 --> 02:16:49.228]  I would attack them.
[02:16:50.368 --> 02:16:52.549]  So, duty is mine.
[02:16:52.669 --> 02:16:55.470]  Consequences are God's, as George Washington said.
[02:16:55.490 --> 02:16:59.311]  And I don't care what the odds are.
[02:16:59.331 --> 02:17:00.612]  I don't care.
[02:17:02.628 --> 02:17:04.470]  You know what's coming down, I'm going to fight it!
[02:17:25.370 --> 02:17:27.653]  All right, let me elaborate on that when we get back.
[02:17:27.693 --> 02:17:30.776]  Just stay there, Thomas, and then we'll go to Ryan and others, too.
[02:17:31.337 --> 02:17:35.983]  A lot of phone calls, taking a lot of your calls, a lot of other news coming up.
[02:17:36.003 --> 02:17:36.563]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:36.583 --> 02:17:43.051]  And, of course, PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.net are two of our revamped new websites.
[02:17:44.850 --> 02:17:45.290]  Gold.
[02:17:45.630 --> 02:17:46.931]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:17:47.191 --> 02:17:53.274]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:17:53.455 --> 02:17:57.277]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:17:57.637 --> 02:17:59.518]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:17:59.578 --> 02:18:01.859]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:18:01.999 --> 02:18:07.602]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency.
[02:18:07.602 --> 02:18:08.043]  We're good to go.
[02:18:23.046 --> 02:18:23.486]  I think so.
[02:18:44.193 --> 02:18:47.476]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:18:47.516 --> 02:18:51.719]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:18:51.959 --> 02:18:54.741]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:18:54.941 --> 02:18:57.343]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:18:57.523 --> 02:19:06.189]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:19:06.369 --> 02:19:07.710]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:19:07.910 --> 02:19:12.073]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:19:12.393 --> 02:19:13.034]  We're good to go!
[02:19:44.134 --> 02:19:46.495]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:19:46.755 --> 02:19:50.577]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:19:50.897 --> 02:19:51.717]  Read the labels.
[02:19:52.138 --> 02:19:56.280]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:19:56.480 --> 02:20:00.682]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:20:01.062 --> 02:20:05.924]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:20:06.304 --> 02:20:09.906]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Calbem Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:20:10.086 --> 02:20:15.429]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:20:15.689 --> 02:20:18.430]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:20:18.730 --> 02:20:19.611]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:21:15.931 --> 02:21:16.692]  Which are collectible?

[02:21:49.469 --> 02:21:51.370]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:51.851 --> 02:21:54.653]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:56.374 --> 02:21:59.877]  My friends, we are an instant gratification society.
[02:22:00.637 --> 02:22:03.739]  Give me the double cheeseburger and fries and super-size it.
[02:22:04.980 --> 02:22:12.906]  We want instant results and Hollywood gives us this archetypal hero image that goes and sweeps aside all evil for all time for us.
[02:22:14.082 --> 02:22:15.042]  That's not how it works.
[02:22:15.102 --> 02:22:15.923]  It's a process.
[02:22:16.583 --> 02:22:18.324]  The New World Order wasn't built overnight.
[02:22:18.344 --> 02:22:19.484]  We won't defeat it overnight.
[02:22:20.584 --> 02:22:30.668]  If we weren't here fighting it, if you weren't out there doing the great things you do, educating people one person at a time, if the fine stations that carry this broadcast and other great shows weren't out there telling the truth,
[02:22:31.596 --> 02:22:34.136]  A little bit of the truth goes a long way compared to their lies.
[02:22:34.517 --> 02:22:36.597]  We would already be in the deeper throes of this.
[02:22:36.997 --> 02:22:39.537]  They would have already had Patriot Act II a year and a half ago.
[02:22:39.818 --> 02:22:41.858]  They would have already had their national ID card.
[02:22:42.198 --> 02:22:43.478]  They're now just about to get it.
[02:22:43.798 --> 02:22:46.339]  Then they'll have trouble implementing it, then we've got to expose that.
[02:22:47.579 --> 02:22:48.879]  There's so much that's happening.
[02:22:49.199 --> 02:22:53.260]  We would have already had more terror attacks if we wouldn't have exposed who's behind the terror.
[02:22:54.140 --> 02:22:57.421]  Half of New Yorkers in major polls believe the government's behind 9-11.
[02:22:57.861 --> 02:22:58.961]  We're winning the fight.
[02:23:00.706 --> 02:23:03.407]  And, you know, they're putting in these domestic military forces.
[02:23:03.447 --> 02:23:05.988]  They're preparing for mass arrests and all this.
[02:23:06.008 --> 02:23:08.289]  I mean, obviously, you've got to defend your family.
[02:23:08.310 --> 02:23:09.550]  That's the line in the sand, folks.
[02:23:09.810 --> 02:23:10.891]  That's why they haven't done it!
[02:23:11.431 --> 02:23:19.735]  You've got 140 million armed Americans, 400 million, you know, new model weapons that are considered new model in the last 85 years.
[02:23:20.895 --> 02:23:27.158]  If 1% of those 130 million people stand up, you're looking at over a million people.
[02:23:28.973 --> 02:23:29.614]  Fighting back.
[02:23:29.734 --> 02:23:34.116]  The globalists have to convince you with psychological warfare to accept what they're doing.
[02:23:34.677 --> 02:23:36.818]  So I don't believe in the physical confrontation.
[02:23:36.858 --> 02:23:38.319]  I don't believe in it offensively.
[02:23:39.099 --> 02:23:40.901]  I will certainly defend myself and my family.
[02:23:40.961 --> 02:23:43.522]  I'm not going to the rest and relocation center.
[02:23:43.542 --> 02:23:44.423]  You can be assured of that.
[02:23:45.203 --> 02:23:54.709]  And real fast, if the cops and military try something like that, even under the cover of a fake smallpox attack they may release, real quick the cops are just going to refuse to go out and follow orders.
[02:23:55.109 --> 02:23:56.330]  This is going to be too dangerous.
[02:23:57.370 --> 02:23:58.171]  For many different reasons.
[02:23:59.708 --> 02:24:05.070]  So, uh, they can't even get the cops to take the forced inoculations, so they can force us to take them.
[02:24:05.830 --> 02:24:07.070]  It's all part of a larger plan.
[02:24:07.330 --> 02:24:12.652]  Does that answer your questions, um... Oh, who were we talking to next?
[02:24:12.672 --> 02:24:14.113]  We were talking to Thomas in Indiana.
[02:24:14.133 --> 02:24:18.094]  Does that... Yeah, okay, and that answers it, but it still doesn't tell me...
[02:24:18.590 --> 02:24:25.793]  What we are going to do, I mean I know that you fight it through information, and I'm not putting you down Alex, I think you're doing a wonderful job, don't get me wrong.
[02:24:25.813 --> 02:24:28.074]  It's not about me, well you're welcome to say I'm wrong if you want to.
[02:24:28.094 --> 02:24:30.955]  Well I know it all, but you're right because I've done my research.
[02:24:31.075 --> 02:24:40.179]  I'm 68 years old, but Alex I'm just trying to tell you that, look I served in the Vietnam War, you know I've seen a lot.
[02:24:40.692 --> 02:24:48.499]  And I know that that war was nothing, and I know they killed Kennedy because he didn't want to have involvement in that, and the Federal Reserve, and the CIA, and all that.
[02:24:48.539 --> 02:24:50.641]  They killed a man who wanted to do right.
[02:24:51.161 --> 02:25:01.830]  But Alex, you can't tell me for one minute that if they do have a terrorist attack here in this country of some large magnitude, the people in this country aren't going to remember what you said.
[02:25:01.850 --> 02:25:03.532]  They're going to be in mass hysteria.
[02:25:04.315 --> 02:25:09.098]  They're going to be running in the streets, the stock market's going to crash, and we're going to have no economy, Alex.
[02:25:09.198 --> 02:25:12.180]  I don't believe this country has a long future.
[02:25:12.200 --> 02:25:12.521]  All right.
[02:25:12.741 --> 02:25:13.842]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[02:25:14.542 --> 02:25:17.824]  All I can say to this is that I agree with what you said, that it's in God's hands.
[02:25:18.985 --> 02:25:23.728]  And I think the better one would have a saying, trust in God, but tie up your camel.
[02:25:25.029 --> 02:25:26.691]  You know, God helps those that help themselves.
[02:25:27.071 --> 02:25:30.033]  We have to stand up, make the stands when it seems the darkest.
[02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:36.061]  And they would have already carried out their fake bio-attacks, but their own minions wouldn't go along with it.
[02:25:36.521 --> 02:25:36.801]  Sure.
[02:25:37.781 --> 02:25:40.962]  And I mean, you can go, look at the size of that thing, there's no way to defeat it, oh my gosh!
[02:25:41.482 --> 02:25:42.822]  You gotta just stand against it.
[02:25:43.362 --> 02:25:47.903]  I mean, I know this, the system will feed on those that serve it as much as it feeds on those that fight it.
[02:25:48.503 --> 02:25:50.683]  I mean, I know we're better off fighting it, period.
[02:25:52.984 --> 02:25:56.084]  And they want a stock market implosion when they want it at a certain time.
[02:25:56.844 --> 02:25:58.905]  They're already outsourcing almost all the jobs.
[02:25:59.045 --> 02:26:00.585]  Yeah, they're killing America.
[02:26:01.334 --> 02:26:04.177]  And they want to then have a terror attack at the real implosion point.
[02:26:04.617 --> 02:26:06.519]  It's like the stock market crash the week before 9-11.
[02:26:06.539 --> 02:26:09.001]  9-11 was used as a cover for that.
[02:26:09.541 --> 02:26:14.506]  But I mean, you know, wishing and hoping and saying, oh, it's too bad, there's nothing we can do.
[02:26:14.786 --> 02:26:15.747]  That doesn't change it.
[02:26:16.548 --> 02:26:19.530]  You can go ahead and psychologically and spiritually capitulate to it.
[02:26:20.411 --> 02:26:21.712]  That's what most Americans have done.
[02:26:21.752 --> 02:26:24.555]  You know, they have no respect for themselves and don't believe they can affect change.
[02:26:25.777 --> 02:26:29.178]  So, as for me, I'm going to stand up and fight.
[02:26:30.038 --> 02:26:31.058]  You can be assured of that.
[02:26:32.378 --> 02:26:33.798]  I'm following this to the end of the road.
[02:26:34.419 --> 02:26:35.919]  Some hell or high water, as they say.
[02:26:36.719 --> 02:26:39.840]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ryan in Ohio.
[02:26:39.900 --> 02:26:40.740]  Ryan, go ahead.
[02:26:41.060 --> 02:26:41.360]  Yeah.
[02:26:42.060 --> 02:26:45.080]  I had a couple of things I was going to ask you.
[02:26:45.380 --> 02:26:46.361]  You did one news article.
[02:26:46.381 --> 02:26:48.721]  You said, well, millions of Americans don't have health insurance.
[02:26:49.381 --> 02:26:50.021]  1.7 million veterans.
[02:26:50.041 --> 02:26:50.241]  Veterans.
[02:26:54.355 --> 02:26:55.196]  People that don't have it.
[02:26:55.776 --> 02:26:59.399]  What do we do with people that don't have health insurance?
[02:26:59.459 --> 02:27:03.963]  I mean, I know that if the government takes over health insurance, that turns us into a socialist country.
[02:27:04.243 --> 02:27:05.384]  The government already has.
[02:27:05.964 --> 02:27:06.365]  Pretty much.
[02:27:06.925 --> 02:27:07.165]  Yeah.
[02:27:07.185 --> 02:27:11.449]  And the other thing is, um, I want you to fight on a property tax.
[02:27:11.549 --> 02:27:14.671]  I think it's unconstitutional because then you really don't own your property.
[02:27:14.912 --> 02:27:16.293]  You're now paying rent to the government.
[02:27:17.634 --> 02:27:23.879]  And the other thing is, would they, um, do this thing with while your kid's in school saying, oh, we're having a, um,
[02:27:24.648 --> 02:27:27.050]  Police state or there's an emergency and they keep my kid in school.
[02:27:27.310 --> 02:27:28.130]  What am I supposed to do?
[02:27:28.210 --> 02:27:30.392]  Just sit back and wait until they let me have my kid back or what?
[02:27:30.412 --> 02:27:32.213]  You're supposed to get your child out of public school.
[02:27:32.233 --> 02:27:33.534]  We'll be right back with it.
[02:27:35.115 --> 02:27:36.015]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.496 --> 02:27:38.117]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.037 --> 02:27:41.699]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.193 --> 02:27:52.675]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:53.095 --> 02:27:57.336]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:27:57.556 --> 02:28:04.598]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:04.978 --> 02:28:11.080]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:11.220 --> 02:28:12.440]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:12.780 --> 02:28:15.743]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:15.883 --> 02:28:17.805]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:28:18.226 --> 02:28:25.453]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:28:25.753 --> 02:28:29.157]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:28:29.557 --> 02:28:34.284]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time that's 866-885-6625 call today!
[02:28:44.895 --> 02:28:50.120]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:28:50.261 --> 02:28:58.369]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:28:58.629 --> 02:29:05.676]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:29:05.856 --> 02:29:07.117]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:29:07.217 --> 02:29:13.099]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:29:13.299 --> 02:29:18.381]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:29:18.501 --> 02:29:27.365]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:29:27.625 --> 02:29:34.588]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at
[02:29:35.148 --> 02:29:35.948]  We're good to go.
[02:29:44.517 --> 02:29:52.582]  We at ActiveX American Incorporated would like to thank our faithful customers for making SynFlex one of the leading glucosamine and chondroitin formulas on the market today.

[02:30:58.550 --> 02:31:03.934]  Alright, Ryan, to try to answer your questions quickly, because I've got a bunch of news and of course a load of phone lines here.
[02:31:05.055 --> 02:31:08.617]  But all these callers are great and bring up such important central points.
[02:31:09.938 --> 02:31:11.059]  What's going on with health care?
[02:31:12.260 --> 02:31:23.728]  Well, again, we have this whole fake left-right paradigm where, oh, we're against socialism with the government running health care, but all we've got now is corporate fascism, where the doctors are all getting paid less than they used to.
[02:31:24.169 --> 02:31:25.650]  They're not getting rich like we used to.
[02:31:25.670 --> 02:31:27.411]  The doctor got wealthy.
[02:31:28.399 --> 02:31:31.460]  They're getting less and less, whether they're a medical doctor, a dentist, whatever.
[02:31:33.921 --> 02:31:43.425]  And the HMOs and others have shut it up where they get all the profits and the insurance companies and they're all protected.
[02:31:44.665 --> 02:31:51.888]  And then they also pass on all the prices to you for all these new medical developments that are only available to the elite.
[02:31:52.388 --> 02:31:57.510]  Back when we had a real free market system, we had the most accelerated healthcare ever and very low prices.
[02:31:58.251 --> 02:32:05.577]  But now it went from being a free market to being a crony capital system that's a staged event.
[02:32:05.937 --> 02:32:10.801]  I mean, we have all the key areas of the economy being taken over by organized crime syndicates.
[02:32:10.821 --> 02:32:16.185]  So whether it's water, or energy, or healthcare, or transportation, it's about gouging you.
[02:32:16.545 --> 02:32:20.148]  They create cartels or oligopolies and then jack up prices.
[02:32:20.608 --> 02:32:25.392]  Also, we're paying for the healthcare of 30 million illegal aliens who get it all paid for for free.
[02:32:26.610 --> 02:32:28.471]  And then citizens have to pay for it themselves.
[02:32:28.491 --> 02:32:29.172]  I mean, that's admitted.
[02:32:29.792 --> 02:32:31.473]  So you're paying for 30 million people, too.
[02:32:33.354 --> 02:32:41.039]  That's another big problem to where citizens have to go to Mexico to get health care because it's still cheap down there and they have even some better treatments.
[02:32:42.480 --> 02:32:46.523]  Then you had a question about the drills of taking over the schools and martial law.
[02:32:48.464 --> 02:32:50.606]  I wanted to hold you over, Ryan, but you hung up.
[02:32:51.046 --> 02:32:52.707]  I wanted to ask you, are you married?
[02:32:53.683 --> 02:33:10.929]  You know, this system is set up of breaking up the family, the government's own documents clearly state, so that there's one parent working two or three jobs, you have to send them to government training centers, government doctoration centers, and so you lose control of your life.
[02:33:10.969 --> 02:33:15.831]  But if you are married, I suggest you take a second job, or a third job.
[02:33:16.211 --> 02:33:17.692]  I don't care if you have to work 18 hours a day.
[02:33:19.344 --> 02:33:38.882]  You take other jobs, get rid of one of your cars, move to a smaller house, get a trailer outside town, buy your kid the cheap jeans and cheap shoes and cheap shirts, stop going out to eat every day, which you probably don't do, and homeschool that child.
[02:33:39.955 --> 02:33:40.696]  That's what you do.
[02:33:41.336 --> 02:33:46.740]  And the Feds know that people are doing this now, from a couple hundred thousand to five or six million a year now.
[02:33:47.080 --> 02:33:52.004]  In the last six years, it's gone from a couple hundred thousand to tens of millions in the aggregate.
[02:33:52.665 --> 02:33:59.149]  They're panicking, so now they have federal training drills, and if you want federal money, you've got to do a drill where homeschoolers are terrorists and attack and kill everyone.
[02:34:00.490 --> 02:34:02.092]  It's not true, it's not reality.
[02:34:02.732 --> 02:34:05.014]  It's total theater, but that's the new world order for you.
[02:34:05.034 --> 02:34:06.515]  So they're gearing up to try to stop that, too.
[02:34:08.539 --> 02:34:13.182]  They're panicking because their system will fail if enough of you get your children out of the camps.
[02:34:14.603 --> 02:34:15.944]  And I don't want to hear of the excuses.
[02:34:16.785 --> 02:34:18.346]  You can't homeschool your children.
[02:34:18.906 --> 02:34:25.410]  It would be better for you not to send your children to school at all than to put them in public schools.
[02:34:25.631 --> 02:34:26.371]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:34:27.932 --> 02:34:31.775]  They are designed to ruin their minds, to make them little consumers.
[02:34:31.935 --> 02:34:36.178]  And I'm not saying things are bad, but when things are God, that's consumerism.
[02:34:37.839 --> 02:34:38.259]  It's simple.
[02:34:39.279 --> 02:34:41.761]  You can get together with a local homeschooling community.
[02:34:42.602 --> 02:34:42.962]  Offer.
[02:34:43.382 --> 02:34:48.165]  You know, go interview homeschooling families and offer to pay them a little bit to homeschool your child.
[02:34:48.245 --> 02:34:50.967]  I don't think they'll mind having another child there if your child is well-behaved.
[02:34:50.987 --> 02:34:56.811]  If your child isn't well-behaved, it's probably because they've been at the public school drinking three Cokes and two candy bars a day on average.
[02:34:57.212 --> 02:34:59.413]  I mean, these issues just expand out from there.
[02:35:00.093 --> 02:35:04.156]  You make whatever sacrifices are needed to not put your child in a camp.
[02:35:05.017 --> 02:35:06.478]  And that's what these schools are, camps.
[02:35:07.375 --> 02:35:09.636]  That was a third question and I forgot it, so I'm sorry.
[02:35:09.656 --> 02:35:13.178]  Alright, I'm going to give each caller a minute because I've got to move quick.
[02:35:13.258 --> 02:35:15.839]  I've got to get through these calls and I've got to go to some more of this news.
[02:35:16.880 --> 02:35:18.161]  Howard in Colorado.
[02:35:18.201 --> 02:35:19.161]  Howard, you're on the air.
[02:35:19.221 --> 02:35:19.541]  Welcome.
[02:35:19.821 --> 02:35:21.822]  Yeah, Alex, I can tell you what you can do.
[02:35:21.842 --> 02:35:29.366]  You can get out in the streets and start demonstrating the same as I've done since before the war started, but can I read one quick thing?
[02:35:30.107 --> 02:35:30.327]  Sure.
[02:35:30.567 --> 02:35:32.408]  This is a quote from Barbara Bush.
[02:35:33.174 --> 02:35:36.599]  George W. Bush's mother on Good Morning America interview.
[02:35:36.659 --> 02:35:39.283]  I have two beautiful of a mind to care about the dead troops.
[02:35:39.343 --> 02:35:40.444]  It shouldn't be on the news.
[02:35:40.724 --> 02:35:41.005]  Right.
[02:35:41.806 --> 02:35:42.207]  Okay.
[02:35:42.307 --> 02:35:43.168]  Go ahead and read the quote.
[02:35:44.019 --> 02:35:44.640]  Or you want me to read it?
[02:35:44.660 --> 02:35:46.121]  By the way, I don't do that to show off.
[02:35:46.201 --> 02:35:50.205]  I do that because I want listeners to know that what you're reading is documented.
[02:35:50.265 --> 02:35:50.565]  Go ahead.
[02:35:50.585 --> 02:35:53.227]  Yeah, I got the people who did it.
[02:35:53.688 --> 02:35:54.849]  No, I've got a link.
[02:35:55.029 --> 02:35:56.230]  It's a mainstream news article.
[02:35:56.450 --> 02:35:58.812]  And then later, they actually edited it out of the link.
[02:35:59.092 --> 02:36:06.098]  So we have the screenshot from the Good Morning America transcript of the original article from the Google cache, where they save it.
[02:36:06.419 --> 02:36:09.261]  Then they went later and edited that when it got attention to it.
[02:36:09.481 --> 02:36:09.882]  Go ahead.
[02:36:10.342 --> 02:36:14.006]  Why should we hear about body bags and deaths, and how many?
[02:36:14.607 --> 02:36:19.832]  What day it's going to happen, and how many this, or what do you suppose?
[02:36:20.633 --> 02:36:26.660]  Oh, I mean, it's not relevant, but why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like that?
[02:36:27.267 --> 02:36:32.748]  Now that's how callous these bushes are and how little they really give a crap about the American public.
[02:36:32.948 --> 02:36:34.448]  Do me a favor, just please.
[02:36:34.468 --> 02:36:36.829]  We have a lot of tens of thousands of homeschoolers listening.
[02:36:36.869 --> 02:36:37.549]  Watch your language.
[02:36:38.629 --> 02:36:41.810]  Always address my audience as if you're talking to five-year-olds, because you are.
[02:36:42.170 --> 02:36:42.530]  Okay.
[02:36:42.790 --> 02:36:45.350]  Now let me say something.
[02:36:45.430 --> 02:36:50.031]  The 23rd of this month, there will be a demonstration at the Jefferson Memorial.
[02:36:50.151 --> 02:36:52.171]  We are taking 1,100 coffins.
[02:36:52.892 --> 02:36:55.292]  They are draped with flags.
[02:36:56.002 --> 02:36:57.343]  I agree with you.
[02:37:16.345 --> 02:37:18.626]  So I don't want to take up any more time.
[02:37:18.666 --> 02:37:19.586]  Howard, great call.
[02:37:19.646 --> 02:37:20.706]  I appreciate your call.
[02:37:20.906 --> 02:37:24.327]  And you know, they won't let you take photos of the coffins being brought in.
[02:37:24.367 --> 02:37:25.167]  They're all secret.
[02:37:25.527 --> 02:37:31.409]  And I think going out with simulated coffins, you ought to have, you know, 1,125.
[02:37:31.469 --> 02:37:32.329]  How many dead is it now?
[02:37:32.689 --> 02:37:35.790]  We ought to have that many coffins marching down every street every month.
[02:37:37.555 --> 02:37:39.937]  And don't forget Kennedy's quote that people mentioned earlier.
[02:37:40.557 --> 02:37:46.223]  The high office of the president has been used to foment a plot to destroy the American's freedom.
[02:37:46.303 --> 02:37:50.086]  And before I leave office, I plan to inform the citizenry of this plight.
[02:37:50.126 --> 02:37:55.512]  John F. Kennedy, 1963, Columbia University, ten days before he was shot dead in Dallas, Texas.
[02:37:56.733 --> 02:37:59.816]  Let us go ahead now and talk to Kara in Colorado.
[02:38:00.196 --> 02:38:01.077]  Kara, welcome.
[02:38:01.442 --> 02:38:02.522]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:38:02.622 --> 02:38:05.603]  I was just listening to... Are you on a speakerphone?
[02:38:05.763 --> 02:38:06.843]  Yeah, hang on a second.
[02:38:06.903 --> 02:38:07.744]  It's unintelligible.
[02:38:07.964 --> 02:38:08.564]  Sorry about that.
[02:38:09.304 --> 02:38:11.784]  Yeah, I was listening to NPR.
[02:38:11.885 --> 02:38:15.945]  Actually, it's my local NPR affiliate, but they do BBC after hours.
[02:38:16.586 --> 02:38:21.827]  And they had a gentleman from Bhutan, and he talked about his
[02:38:22.467 --> 02:38:22.988]  And by the way...
[02:38:40.143 --> 02:38:43.428]  That's always been the problem with the National ID Card.
[02:38:43.468 --> 02:38:46.613]  As we said, they can categorize, control, punish people.
[02:38:46.673 --> 02:38:48.615]  Now with the Caps 2 system, they do just that.
[02:38:48.956 --> 02:38:53.443]  And the bill, two of the bills introduced, one has passed and is about to go to the President.
[02:38:53.503 --> 02:38:54.865]  It's in conference committee right now.
[02:38:55.677 --> 02:39:02.560]  Absolutely, and I think that's the future of what we're looking at is what they're doing in the third world countries is just, you know, just wait for it to crawl up to us.
[02:39:25.729 --> 02:39:26.369]  Absolutely.
[02:39:27.070 --> 02:39:28.430]  Yeah, that was it, Alex.
[02:39:28.450 --> 02:39:29.371]  That's what I wanted to say.
[02:39:29.871 --> 02:39:31.312]  Well, that's a startling example.
[02:39:31.372 --> 02:39:32.632]  What country did you say that was?
[02:39:32.932 --> 02:39:33.513]  Bhutan.
[02:39:34.153 --> 02:39:34.973]  Bhutan.
[02:39:36.834 --> 02:39:38.595]  To show my ignorance, where is Bhutan?
[02:39:39.997 --> 02:39:41.798]  But I believe it's in Southeast Asia, thereabouts.
[02:39:41.958 --> 02:39:56.725]  Yeah, that's what I thought it was in Southeast Asia, but I didn't want to... I would say, you know, one of your... one of... probably the gentleman that just called a few calls back, who's been in Vietnam, probably has a better clue than I do, but... Yeah, Bhutan, that's... I believe it's the Bhutan Peninsula.
[02:39:56.745 --> 02:39:59.106]  We need to get that article posted.
[02:39:59.426 --> 02:40:00.907]  Yeah, you know what it was?
[02:40:00.987 --> 02:40:08.170]  It was actually like an interview on BBC... Yeah, I know they carry BBC on local NPRs, yeah.
[02:40:08.530 --> 02:40:10.171]  Yes, and that's where I heard it.
[02:40:10.751 --> 02:40:15.153]  I can try to dig it up and send you a link if they have the audio.
[02:40:15.173 --> 02:40:15.773]  Yeah, do that.
[02:40:15.973 --> 02:40:17.654]  Send it to tips at InfoWars.com.
[02:40:17.734 --> 02:40:18.554]  Thanks for the call.
[02:40:18.674 --> 02:40:19.034]  Thank you.
[02:40:19.054 --> 02:40:20.074]  Good to hear from you, Kara.
[02:40:20.815 --> 02:40:22.395]  Larry in New Mexico.
[02:40:22.455 --> 02:40:23.196]  Larry, welcome.
[02:40:23.676 --> 02:40:24.456]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:40:24.616 --> 02:40:25.156]  Good, my friend.
[02:40:25.997 --> 02:40:28.878]  I just want to tell you about something that's going on down here in New Mexico.
[02:40:29.758 --> 02:40:37.241]  I've seen a lot of the different helicopters and stuff, but they're moving, it just started, they're moving these massive white boxcars.
[02:40:37.896 --> 02:40:41.679]  on trains out here, I mean complete train loads of them.
[02:40:42.280 --> 02:40:45.582]  Then they've also had all kinds of helicopters flying over here.
[02:40:46.863 --> 02:40:56.331]  There's many reports, I haven't seen them with my own eyes, I have seen pictures of them, of Russian helicopters, these great big double bladed ones, fully armed and everything else.
[02:40:58.092 --> 02:40:59.533]  Well let's talk about what we know.
[02:41:01.409 --> 02:41:03.530]  Seven days after 9-11, U.N.
[02:41:03.570 --> 02:41:06.512]  General McKenzie said on Nightline, we will use U.N.
[02:41:06.532 --> 02:41:07.513]  troops in America.
[02:41:08.053 --> 02:41:09.694]  The Joint Chiefs of Staff have said it.
[02:41:10.414 --> 02:41:14.296]  They've said that they use NATO, AWACS, Norwegian F-16s.
[02:41:15.397 --> 02:41:17.018]  They've said they'll, quote, use foreign assets.
[02:41:17.058 --> 02:41:17.738]  They use the U.N.
[02:41:17.758 --> 02:41:24.222]  to fight forest fires in 99, which Clinton admitted they ordered set, quote, as a controlled burn in 12 western states.
[02:41:26.055 --> 02:41:30.156]  They have told the State Guard, the National Guard, Special Forces, State Police.
[02:41:30.756 --> 02:41:32.477]  I've interviewed all these people on and off air.
[02:41:32.857 --> 02:41:33.697]  I have the documents.
[02:41:33.717 --> 02:41:35.397]  They've been told martial law is coming.
[02:41:35.838 --> 02:41:36.778]  I'm not saying it is.
[02:41:36.878 --> 02:41:37.378]  They are.
[02:41:37.878 --> 02:41:42.299]  And regardless, they've geared up for it, whether it comes this month or five years from now.
[02:41:42.759 --> 02:41:46.660]  All of this is the program of setting it up.
[02:41:48.497 --> 02:41:49.398]  I agree all the way.
[02:41:49.458 --> 02:41:53.782]  Well, they've got all these boxcars moving out, you know, just massive amounts.
[02:41:53.802 --> 02:41:54.803]  I've never seen anything like it.
[02:41:54.823 --> 02:41:57.525]  You know, I wish they'd go put the troops on the border, but oh, that can't happen.
[02:41:57.545 --> 02:41:57.866]  Oh, no.
[02:41:57.886 --> 02:41:59.527]  It's got to be in our city streets.
[02:41:59.547 --> 02:42:00.888]  It's got to be for us, the citizens.
[02:42:01.209 --> 02:42:01.389]  Yep.
[02:42:01.449 --> 02:42:06.754]  Well, I guess down here there's a big thing with 60 Minutes coming down and doing interviews with all the border patrol.
[02:42:06.814 --> 02:42:11.378]  All they're doing is using them to pick up litter and making them turn their heads while
[02:42:11.938 --> 02:42:13.119]  Illegals are sneaking over.
[02:42:13.159 --> 02:42:13.940]  They've been ordered to.
[02:42:13.960 --> 02:42:15.361]  They're only allowed to look one direction.
[02:42:15.381 --> 02:42:19.704]  They'll put them on the border and say, you can look left, you can look right, but if you see illegals on your right, you can't stop them.
[02:42:20.004 --> 02:42:21.706]  Thanks for the call.
[02:42:21.946 --> 02:42:22.687]  It's all public.
[02:42:22.747 --> 02:42:23.527]  It's the end of the country.
[02:42:24.308 --> 02:42:25.088]  Ann in Michigan.
[02:42:25.168 --> 02:42:25.909]  Ann, you're on the air.
[02:42:25.969 --> 02:42:26.389]  Go ahead.
[02:42:26.710 --> 02:42:26.890]  Hi.
[02:42:27.570 --> 02:42:31.115]  Alex, I'm still not sure we can blame our government 100%.
[02:42:32.376 --> 02:42:39.805]  I still think this all boils down to the World Bank because our guys are just puppets and the UN is just a bigger puppet show.
[02:42:39.845 --> 02:42:44.991]  That's what I've always said is... Their luxury is a general anonymity.
[02:42:45.686 --> 02:42:52.733]  Okay, they're out there and they're pulling all these strings and all of us poor serfs don't know who they are.
[02:42:53.133 --> 02:42:55.475]  Well, we do know who they are, but you're right.
[02:42:55.495 --> 02:42:58.458]  No, and when they're walking down the street, who knows who they are?
[02:42:58.478 --> 02:43:00.019]  Do you know who they are?
[02:43:00.199 --> 02:43:01.220]  Yeah, I sure do, yeah.
[02:43:01.320 --> 02:43:04.583]  Their sons, daughters, wives, families, do you know who they are?
[02:43:05.264 --> 02:43:07.186]  Uh, yes, we know who the ruling families are, yes ma'am.
[02:43:08.268 --> 02:43:12.010]  Well, I wouldn't recognize them walking down the street now with a magazine.
[02:43:12.051 --> 02:43:16.373]  Well, we recognize their institutions and their companies and the web of control.
[02:43:16.654 --> 02:43:35.126]  But what I believe we need is a nice six-by-nine set of collector's playing cards with the head clock in the center and all of his progeny around it, listing their place of work, their winter home, their summer home, their vacation homes, just the city.
[02:43:35.206 --> 02:43:37.287]  We don't want to be too specific.
[02:43:38.588 --> 02:43:42.730]  Get someone to print them and distribute them throughout the United States and Europe.
[02:43:43.290 --> 02:43:48.393]  Because that way they would have to feel the way they intend to make us feel.
[02:43:48.893 --> 02:43:52.935]  As though they have to look over their shoulders all the time.
[02:43:53.235 --> 02:43:55.777]  And they don't right now, do they?
[02:43:57.738 --> 02:44:01.700]  Actually, Fritz Springmeier did that in a book.
[02:44:01.760 --> 02:44:04.521]  We carry it and they came and arrested him and framed him immediately.
[02:44:06.231 --> 02:44:10.593]  That is a good way to get yourself in a pine box in about 20 minutes or behind bars.
[02:44:10.994 --> 02:44:11.634]  Yeah.
[02:44:11.674 --> 02:44:18.937]  But we should expose who the New World Order controllers are and put them on public databases just like they do us.
[02:44:18.957 --> 02:44:22.279]  I know, but I still think they deserve playing cards.
[02:44:22.419 --> 02:44:23.239]  I really do.
[02:44:23.479 --> 02:44:24.720]  There are a lot of playing cards.
[02:44:25.380 --> 02:44:26.140]  I appreciate the call.
[02:44:28.607 --> 02:44:29.328]  Interesting points.
[02:44:29.608 --> 02:44:31.029]  I know all about the Pine Box.
[02:44:31.169 --> 02:44:33.131]  I mean, just anonymous playing cards.
[02:44:33.191 --> 02:44:34.792]  No one knows where the heck they came from.
[02:44:34.912 --> 02:44:35.793]  Thanks for the call, Ann.
[02:44:36.353 --> 02:44:37.214]  I appreciate the call.
[02:44:37.274 --> 02:44:37.654]  Thank you.
[02:44:38.415 --> 02:44:40.116]  Let me try to cover some news now.
[02:44:40.236 --> 02:44:41.638]  If I have time, I'll get to other calls.
[02:44:43.439 --> 02:44:45.721]  Shady, terrorists may use bomb.
[02:44:46.750 --> 02:44:47.570]  In Maybomb U.S.
[02:44:47.610 --> 02:44:58.295]  Cities, he talks about nuclear threats, the biggest threat we now face as a nation, and the possibility of terrorists ending up in the middle of one of our cities with deadlier weapons than have ever been used against us.
[02:44:58.775 --> 02:45:00.716]  Biological agents, or even a nuclear weapon.
[02:45:00.736 --> 02:45:02.977]  And he goes on, you better vote for us.
[02:45:03.077 --> 02:45:03.797]  Then I have the U.S.
[02:45:03.837 --> 02:45:05.157]  News and World Report, May 17th.
[02:45:05.237 --> 02:45:13.921]  There it says, a Trump administration official said an attack will happen leading up to the election, and he added, it will happen here, it will happen at the Capitol.
[02:45:15.071 --> 02:45:16.753]  It's White House official tells U.S.
[02:45:16.813 --> 02:45:17.714]  News and World Report.
[02:45:19.395 --> 02:45:20.677]  And again continuing, U.S.
[02:45:20.697 --> 02:45:24.560]  has contingency plans for a draft of military workers.
[02:45:26.062 --> 02:45:35.952]  And it says the Selective Service has been updating its contingency plans for a draft of doctors, nurses, and other health care workers in case of a national emergency that overwhelms the military medical corps.
[02:45:36.897 --> 02:45:48.325]  And a confidential report this summer, a contractor hired by the agency described how such a draft might work, how to secure compliance, and how to mold public opinion and communicate with the health care professionals.
[02:45:48.385 --> 02:45:50.646]  So that's just one of the many drafts that are getting ready.
[02:45:51.187 --> 02:45:52.828]  That's out of the New York Times.
[02:45:53.448 --> 02:45:54.189]  Here's another one.
[02:45:55.169 --> 02:45:57.191]  This is FDA.
[02:45:58.067 --> 02:46:13.693]  Electronical Hazards, MRI, Incompatibility, Adverse Tissue Reaction, and Migration of the Implantable Transponder are just a few of the potential risks associated with the Verichip ID implanted device according to an October 12th letter issued by the Food and Drug Administration.
[02:46:14.093 --> 02:46:16.094]  Of course, that wasn't put in any of the newspapers.
[02:46:17.255 --> 02:46:23.497]  And it talks about all the problems that the implantable chips, which now government officials all over the planet are being forced to take,
[02:46:24.848 --> 02:46:27.691]  RFID coming to a library near you, CNET News.
[02:46:29.032 --> 02:46:36.197]  For a glimpse of how RFID technology could transform stores, factories, and people's everyday lives, you may only need to look as far as your local library.
[02:46:36.658 --> 02:46:43.323]  Hundreds of city and college libraries are placing special microchips known as RFID tags on books in an effort to make libraries more efficient.
[02:46:43.863 --> 02:46:53.691]  The tags are central to the new breed of digital tracking system that can speed checkouts, keep collections in better order, and even alleviate repetitive
[02:46:55.020 --> 02:46:57.141]  Strain injuries among librarians.
[02:46:58.522 --> 02:47:00.022]  Boy, it's just so good.
[02:47:01.143 --> 02:47:04.924]  And then continuing, Gulf War Syndrome does exist, says report.
[02:47:05.484 --> 02:47:10.166]  London Independent, Gulf War Syndrome has been demonstrated to exist by scientists in the U.S.
[02:47:10.206 --> 02:47:15.328]  according to the New York Times, quoting a report by the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans Illness.
[02:47:15.808 --> 02:47:19.530]  In the report, which was leaked to the paper, Professor Patrice Gottlieb,
[02:47:20.541 --> 02:47:39.513]  Or Golub, the committee's chief scientist, said the exposures to particular substances during the 1991 war may have affected some soldiers' body chemistry and added that the troops' health problems may definitively be caused by contact with toxic chemicals rather than stress or psychiatric illness.
[02:47:40.253 --> 02:47:44.476]  For 12-13 years they've been putting them on Ritalin, Prozac,
[02:47:45.154 --> 02:47:52.519]  They've been arresting them, they've been taking their health care away, they shrivel up, get in wheelchairs, die, and say, you had a mental problem.
[02:47:52.919 --> 02:47:57.042]  Then they test their dead brains and find little massive levels of sarin and VX.
[02:47:57.202 --> 02:48:03.726]  And of course we have the video of our own troops planting explosives in the bunkers to blow up the evidence of U.S.
[02:48:03.786 --> 02:48:06.248]  marked chemical and biological weapons.
[02:48:06.948 --> 02:48:07.889]  Did they give you treatment?
[02:48:07.989 --> 02:48:08.349]  No!
[02:48:08.429 --> 02:48:09.810]  They keep that money for themselves.
[02:48:14.375 --> 02:48:16.356]  Mr. Baker said this is senior research.
[02:48:16.376 --> 02:48:19.116]  It is not by private venture or by someone with an axe to grind.
[02:48:20.016 --> 02:48:22.457]  And still the government denies it and gives them no treatment.
[02:48:24.718 --> 02:48:29.959]  Alright, we'll come back and hit some other key news items in the final segment, so please stay the course with us.
[02:48:30.859 --> 02:48:33.380]  We'll jam a couple more calls in here if we have time.

[02:48:46.568 --> 02:48:49.671]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:49.811 --> 02:48:53.693]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:53.753 --> 02:48:57.976]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:58.337 --> 02:49:02.119]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:02.200 --> 02:49:03.981]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:07.504 --> 02:49:12.289]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:12.469 --> 02:49:15.512]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:15.692 --> 02:49:18.535]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:19.035 --> 02:49:25.161]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:25.681 --> 02:49:29.464]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:51:51.401 --> 02:51:53.702]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:51:56.229 --> 02:51:57.250]  That's right there is.
[02:51:57.350 --> 02:51:58.671]  I said I'd air this last hour.
[02:51:58.711 --> 02:51:59.272]  I forgot.
[02:51:59.432 --> 02:52:00.913]  Thanks to the great folks running the show.
[02:52:00.933 --> 02:52:01.613]  They reminded me.
[02:52:01.654 --> 02:52:02.494]  This is Limbaugh.
[02:52:03.035 --> 02:52:04.856]  One of his quotes is now in the news.
[02:52:04.896 --> 02:52:07.038]  He said it was a spectacular game plan.
[02:52:07.058 --> 02:52:08.219]  The torture is okay.
[02:52:08.979 --> 02:52:09.960]  We don't have those clips.
[02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:11.421]  They are in the mainstream news though.
[02:52:11.802 --> 02:52:15.585]  But here is one of the clips we do have where he compares it to just blowing off steam.
[02:52:16.303 --> 02:52:18.683]  People being tortured psychologically wrong with that.
[02:52:19.104 --> 02:52:26.565]  It's not the act so much, it was like a college fraternity prank to stack up naked men and... Exactly!
[02:52:26.905 --> 02:52:28.585]  Exactly my point!
[02:52:28.905 --> 02:52:39.768]  This is no different than what happens at the Skull and Bones initiation, and we're gonna ruin people's lives over it, and we're gonna hamper our military effort, and then we're gonna really hammer them because they had a good time.
[02:52:41.588 --> 02:52:41.828]  You know,
[02:52:42.868 --> 02:52:44.970]  These people are being fired at every day.
[02:52:45.030 --> 02:52:46.492]  I'm talking about people having a good time.
[02:52:46.812 --> 02:52:49.275]  These people... You ever heard of emotional release?
[02:52:50.336 --> 02:52:52.278]  You ever heard of needing to blow some steam off?
[02:52:53.499 --> 02:52:59.184]  Yeah, I guess Ted Bundy liked to strangle women and slit their throats and bite chunks out of them.
[02:52:59.204 --> 02:53:00.506]  I guess he was blowing off some steam.
[02:53:00.786 --> 02:53:03.409]  He even said that, you know, going to law school was very tiring.
[02:53:04.201 --> 02:53:06.422]  You know, I'd like to drop by and slaughter a few women here and there.
[02:53:07.222 --> 02:53:10.924]  I guess Joseph Emmanuella sewing little Jewish kids together was blowing off some steam.
[02:53:11.244 --> 02:53:12.185]  I don't think they were, though.
[02:53:12.205 --> 02:53:13.065]  I think they were bad.
[02:53:14.065 --> 02:53:15.546]  But this is the sickness, folks.
[02:53:15.566 --> 02:53:16.606]  We're a very sick society.
[02:53:17.987 --> 02:53:19.148]  Final news articles here.
[02:53:19.248 --> 02:53:22.249]  Flat screen TV emits international distress signal.
[02:53:23.227 --> 02:53:24.969]  This is Eugene, Oregon, Reuters.
[02:53:25.009 --> 02:53:26.791]  TV hardly gets much better than this.
[02:53:26.851 --> 02:53:39.483]  An Oregon man discovered earlier this month that his year old Toshiba Corporation flat screen TV was emitting an international distress signal picked up by a satellite leading a search and rescue operation to his apartment in Oregon, 70 miles south of Portland.
[02:53:39.583 --> 02:53:46.330]  The signal from Chris Van Rossman's TV was routed by satellite to Air Force Rescue Center at Langley Air Force Base.
[02:53:47.205 --> 02:53:53.568]  The 20-year-old college student was visited by Air Force, police, Civil Air Patrol, a bunch of other... And they told him, we might have to fine you $10,000.
[02:53:53.748 --> 02:53:59.250]  Toshiba's offering him a new TV.
[02:53:59.270 --> 02:54:02.352]  That's the kind of stuff that's in these new TVs, folks.
[02:54:05.293 --> 02:54:06.514]  I mean, giant transmitters.
[02:54:06.534 --> 02:54:07.574]  What do you think that's for, folks?
[02:54:08.535 --> 02:54:12.657]  And continuing, the 9-11 secret in the CIA's back pocket.
[02:54:13.177 --> 02:54:15.898]  New York Times says, according to intelligence officials who spoke
[02:54:16.582 --> 02:54:36.167]  On condition of anonymity, release of the report which represents an exhaustive 17-month investigation by an 11-member team of the agency has been stalled first by Acting CIA Director John McLaughlin and now by Porter J. Goss, the former Republican House Member and Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who recently was appointed CIA Chief by Lord Bush.
[02:54:37.127 --> 02:54:39.868]  And it's how they knew about the 9-11 attacks and did nothing.
[02:54:40.402 --> 02:54:42.944]  That's old news for our listeners, but now mainstream news.
[02:54:43.745 --> 02:54:46.947]  Also, FCC chair to seek net telephone oversight.
[02:54:47.327 --> 02:54:48.508]  This is out of AP Business.
[02:54:49.129 --> 02:54:59.977]  Chairman Michael Powell said Tuesday that he would seek broad regulatory authority for federal government over the internet-based telephone services to avoid stifling the emerging market.
[02:55:00.057 --> 02:55:00.278]  Yeah.
[02:55:00.738 --> 02:55:02.559]  We're going to kill freedom to save freedom.
[02:55:03.200 --> 02:55:05.241]  And this will allow regulation of the net, period.
[02:55:05.882 --> 02:55:08.244]  And he told a receptive audience of Industry Conference
[02:55:09.362 --> 02:55:14.444]  That they are going to take over the net and voice over the internet communications.
[02:55:15.344 --> 02:55:16.145]  Leave it alone!
[02:55:16.725 --> 02:55:17.885]  Leave it alone!
[02:55:18.326 --> 02:55:29.830]  Oh, well we can't have people who have $10, $15 internet every month also be able to have unlimited calls, which are basically free if you have the internet service.
[02:55:31.070 --> 02:55:32.591]  Can't allow that, can we?
[02:55:32.631 --> 02:55:34.272]  We've got to save this emerging market.
[02:55:34.312 --> 02:55:35.272]  We can't let you do that.
[02:55:36.869 --> 02:55:38.010]  I'm out of time, folks.
[02:55:38.110 --> 02:55:40.372]  My new film, American Dictators, is out.
[02:55:40.412 --> 02:55:40.973]  It's excellent.
[02:55:41.013 --> 02:55:42.394]  It's on DVD and VHS.
[02:55:42.454 --> 02:55:46.458]  After you buy one copy for $19.95, each additional copy on DVD is $5.95.

[02:55:51.883 --> 02:55:53.625]  Let me really make a profit on that, folks.
[02:55:54.065 --> 02:55:55.146]  Get it out to people.
