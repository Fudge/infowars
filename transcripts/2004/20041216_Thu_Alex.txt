[00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:06.245]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.925 --> 00:00:07.986]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.686 --> 00:00:09.806]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:11.287]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.027 --> 00:00:12.888]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.908 --> 00:00:17.250]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.832]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.326 --> 00:00:37.747]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:37.807 --> 00:00:40.969]  It is Friday, the 10th day of December 2004.
[00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:48.834]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:48.894 --> 00:00:52.936]  And we have four guests today, but we're also going to have time for your calls.
[00:00:53.116 --> 00:01:00.241]  Elaine Donnelly will be joining us from the Center for Military Readiness about Bush.
[00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:03.383]  He wants women in frontline combat, and he wants it now.
[00:01:04.807 --> 00:01:08.529]  Of course, Bill Clinton tried this, and he was universally decried.
[00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.869]  Bush does it.
[00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:14.391]  And literally, I've heard the neocons saying, you're not a conservative if you're not for it.
[00:01:14.411 --> 00:01:27.477]  If you're not for open borders, if you're not for satellite tracker boxes in your car taxing you, if you're not for national ID cards, if you're not for a doubling in the growth rate of government, you are a liberal, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:28.457 --> 00:01:32.599]  So, while we're against women in frontline combat, I am a commie, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:33.339]  Let's just admit it.
[00:01:34.022 --> 00:01:36.544]  So Elaine Donnelly will be joining us to talk about this.
[00:01:37.444 --> 00:01:45.010]  Then, that's just for 30 minutes, coming up in about 30 minutes, then for the next half of the next hour, we're going to have Dr. Tennant on.
[00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.573]  He's the guy the doctor arrested for complaining too much.
[00:01:49.593 --> 00:01:59.680]  The Homeland Security even told the Quad City Times he didn't threaten anybody, but complaining too much is an act of terrorism, and they're charging him and hitting him hard, and
[00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:04.580]  Trying to make sure he spends time under the jail for calling too much.
[00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:07.722]  And then Vicki Karp joins us.
[00:02:07.762 --> 00:02:19.666]  They're going to have a big march in downtown Austin this weekend, and I've been asked to speak at the Capitol there at the rally, and I'll be pleased to do that on Sunday at high noon.
[00:02:20.386 --> 00:02:26.948]  But Vicki Karp will be joining us to talk about some of the election fraud that's been chronicled in the November 2nd election.
[00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.049]  And then in the third hour...
[00:02:29.818 --> 00:02:39.746]  Bev Harris, one of the grand poobahs, one of the big experts nationally on electronic voting fraud and just the scams that have proliferated across our nation.
[00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:41.828]  She'll be joining us as well.
[00:02:41.848 --> 00:02:52.917]  So the second half of the broadcast, almost exclusively on election fraud, though I'll intersperse other key news items throughout that section of the transmission.
[00:02:55.003 --> 00:03:03.746]  When we get back, though, I want to get into Iraq and the economy and the dollar, and I want to get into the new Patriot Act that's passed to take care of you and your family.
[00:03:04.346 --> 00:03:07.687]  Large sections of it, according to Ron Paul, who joined us yesterday.
[00:03:07.707 --> 00:03:10.408]  And, of course, the National ID card.
[00:03:12.463 --> 00:03:27.295]  And I'll be on Pastor Butch Posh broadcast tonight from 8 to 9 Central, exclusively talking about the ID card, if you want the full history of it and what it means, here on this same network, the GCN network that I am on.
[00:03:29.597 --> 00:03:36.543]  And also we will be getting into, well, those troops getting up and asking Rumsfeld-pointed questions.
[00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:39.706]  And I wasn't going to cover this yesterday, but...
[00:03:40.427 --> 00:03:46.832]  Until they said, oh, a reporter planted the questions, and so now the questions aren't pertinent.
[00:03:48.112 --> 00:04:02.683]  You see, embedded reporters aren't allowed to ask questions, and other reporters aren't allowed into these press conferences, so they're staged, and so to get around it, and he got some of the troops to ask questions, they wouldn't have asked the questions if they weren't concerned.
[00:04:05.385 --> 00:04:07.186]  The questions are still valid.
[00:04:07.918 --> 00:04:09.258]  But that's the double thing.
[00:04:09.478 --> 00:04:11.959]  How dare them traitor troops want armor?
[00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:13.340]  They're liberals.
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.361]  The fat bellies in their easy chairs say.
[00:04:20.842 --> 00:04:22.202]  This is how you support the troops.
[00:04:22.242 --> 00:04:24.823]  You don't give them armor and you let them take deadly vaccines.
[00:04:24.863 --> 00:04:26.883]  You force it on them and you let them breathe DU.
[00:04:26.903 --> 00:04:29.984]  And then if you're for the troops, you're against them.
[00:04:30.324 --> 00:04:32.405]  I'm learning the double thing daily here.
[00:04:35.513 --> 00:04:41.236]  So we'll come back and plunge into all of this after these short messages.
[00:04:41.276 --> 00:04:42.817]  I want to talk about spin.
[00:04:44.358 --> 00:04:48.900]  Perhaps I can calm down a bit and go over just a few examples of spin.
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.882]  The more subtle, crafty forms of spin.
[00:04:54.483 --> 00:04:56.644]  So you can be conscious of spin.
[00:04:57.224 --> 00:04:58.665]  We'll be right back with spin.
[00:05:01.886 --> 00:05:09.271]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:05:09.531 --> 00:05:14.275]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:05:14.495 --> 00:05:20.179]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:24.942]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:05:25.142 --> 00:05:31.647]  The casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massacred,
[00:05:31.747 --> 00:05:31.927]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:00.965 --> 00:06:03.847]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:06:04.207 --> 00:06:07.070]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:13.514]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:06:13.875 --> 00:06:21.200]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.403]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[00:06:25.723 --> 00:06:31.267]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[00:06:31.467 --> 00:06:44.596]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.
[00:06:44.796 --> 00:06:53.402]  Get this hard-to-find information by ordering Food and Places USA now for only $29, plus shipping and handling, by calling New Millennium at 888-7000.

[00:07:02.705 --> 00:07:08.190]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:07:08.611 --> 00:07:13.175]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:07:13.295 --> 00:07:20.122]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:07:20.502 --> 00:07:26.608]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:26.628 --> 00:07:27.969]  There are no side effects.
[00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:28.610]  We're good to go.
[00:07:45.072 --> 00:07:48.175]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:07:48.195 --> 00:07:48.235]  866-885-6625.
[00:07:48.255 --> 00:07:48.555]  866-885-6625.
[00:07:48.575 --> 00:07:49.516]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:07:49.536 --> 00:07:49.736]  Call today.
[00:07:49.756 --> 00:07:51.277]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:51.317 --> 00:07:53.039]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.011 --> 00:08:22.714]  All right, let's plunge straight into the news.
[00:08:24.696 --> 00:08:27.558]  And let's give some examples of spin.
[00:08:28.459 --> 00:08:29.380]  All right, spin.
[00:08:30.321 --> 00:08:35.085]  One of my friends, a documentary film producer, just got back from a week in Los Angeles.
[00:08:36.946 --> 00:08:45.454]  And a lot of people out there knew that he was associated with me, so they'd say, yeah, we're all for this anti-Arnold movement, but Alex Jones...
[00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:47.766]  He said he got this a lot.
[00:08:47.806 --> 00:08:54.271]  Needs to get off the Nazi stuff and get off the steroid stuff and get off the sexual harassment stuff.
[00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:57.754]  And he needs to get on to other things, you know.
[00:08:59.735 --> 00:09:01.177]  This other stuff's old.
[00:09:02.598 --> 00:09:02.718]  And...
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.261]  Well, we need to just focus on the other things that are bad about Schwarzenegger.
[00:09:07.541 --> 00:09:13.222]  You know how he's involved with all the special interests and says he isn't, and we need to talk about that.
[00:09:13.902 --> 00:09:19.464]  Well, you know, my advice to them is they need to go start their own websites and start their own organizations.
[00:09:19.484 --> 00:09:20.384]  But this is what's happened.
[00:09:22.284 --> 00:09:23.205]  And this is spin.
[00:09:25.465 --> 00:09:32.567]  On the, I don't know, 20 interviews I've done in California alone the last three weeks since we launched ArnoldExposed.com,
[00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:45.788]  Every talk show host, even those that are for what we're doing, say, well, you know, we all heard this during the gubernatorial campaign.
[00:09:47.609 --> 00:09:49.030]  And it didn't hurt him then.
[00:09:49.771 --> 00:09:51.672]  And so why are you bringing it up now?
[00:09:52.193 --> 00:09:54.014]  That's the mantra in print media.
[00:09:54.435 --> 00:09:57.697]  Well, yes, we heard these allegations before.
[00:09:57.777 --> 00:10:00.560]  We've already been over this.
[00:10:02.241 --> 00:10:03.262]  Well, the media said that
[00:10:04.142 --> 00:10:05.823]  A year ago, when he was running for governor.
[00:10:07.024 --> 00:10:13.287]  It was, well, we've heard this for years, and people really don't care, so let's not talk about it.
[00:10:13.307 --> 00:10:15.689]  And everybody says, okay, let's not talk about it.
[00:10:15.729 --> 00:10:16.750]  See, that's spin.
[00:10:18.791 --> 00:10:20.412]  It's, let's just change the subject.
[00:10:20.472 --> 00:10:21.772]  Okay, people don't want to hear about this.
[00:10:21.853 --> 00:10:22.733]  Okay, I'll shut up.
[00:10:24.274 --> 00:10:27.636]  You see, that's an example of psychology in play there.
[00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:38.067]  Somebody saying, I don't care if Kirk Valtime's a Nazi, I love him, and I'm going to go campaign for him in the middle of a huge firestorm.
[00:10:39.868 --> 00:10:45.691]  Or somebody who, these aren't old allegations, which he hasn't denied, of just randomly grabbing on women.
[00:10:48.227 --> 00:10:49.707]  The Enron information.
[00:10:50.328 --> 00:10:51.728]  Most people don't even know about that.
[00:10:51.788 --> 00:10:58.750]  It's been in some mainstream papers that he was involved with Enron, but the media, again, won't quote you on that, won't discuss it.
[00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:03.491]  Out of a score of newspapers I've been interviewed by, they just won't mention Enron.
[00:11:03.531 --> 00:11:05.771]  They won't bring in the other serious issues.
[00:11:07.452 --> 00:11:08.892]  Now think about anybody else.
[00:11:09.792 --> 00:11:15.114]  They said, well, forget it if he says he doesn't care if somebody's a Nazi and likes him and wants to be a dictator.
[00:11:15.474 --> 00:11:16.654]  Let's just move on.
[00:11:18.277 --> 00:11:19.878]  They tell you it's a non-issue.
[00:11:19.898 --> 00:11:22.099]  You know, like Bill Clinton would say, so what?
[00:11:22.179 --> 00:11:22.879]  Move on.
[00:11:23.919 --> 00:11:24.640]  Big deal.
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:25.880]  Nobody cares.
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.822]  Forget about the communist Chinese that I sold us out to.
[00:11:30.122 --> 00:11:32.203]  And George Bush said, let's move on.
[00:11:32.283 --> 00:11:32.903]  Forget about it.
[00:11:32.963 --> 00:11:34.043]  It's an old chapter.
[00:11:34.404 --> 00:11:35.584]  Let's not deal with it.
[00:11:37.685 --> 00:11:46.148]  That'd be like if somebody robbed a bank and five years later the cops bust them and find the marked bills in their basement and the guy says, hey, it was five years ago.
[00:11:46.688 --> 00:11:47.769]  Let's move on.
[00:11:48.522 --> 00:11:51.103]  The cops went, okay, sure, let's move on.
[00:11:51.123 --> 00:11:53.463]  Man, you really made a good point there.
[00:11:53.743 --> 00:11:56.684]  I'm a little bit out of control here putting you in handcuffs.
[00:12:00.705 --> 00:12:01.926]  So this is what they do.
[00:12:03.706 --> 00:12:05.147]  And they do it over and over again.
[00:12:10.908 --> 00:12:12.829]  Now there's other forms of spin.
[00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:16.910]  That's where they set the agenda and tell you what can be in the debate and
[00:12:18.479 --> 00:12:18.759]  No.
[00:12:19.359 --> 00:12:20.860]  We have to make that the debate.
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.680]  We have to push it to the fore.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.960]  We have to demand that it be discussed.
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.741]  It's very pertinent, all of it.
[00:12:27.401 --> 00:12:34.442]  But see, even people who think they're against somebody or something, they still pick up, though, the propaganda and then parrot it.
[00:12:35.142 --> 00:12:36.123]  And they get frustrated.
[00:12:36.323 --> 00:12:40.364]  You know, the reason he won the governorship is because people like you focused on stuff like that.
[00:12:40.744 --> 00:12:45.545]  No, it's because you didn't focus on it enough, and you bought into the propaganda at the time.
[00:12:45.785 --> 00:12:47.325]  Look at yourself in the mirror.
[00:12:48.032 --> 00:12:51.113]  If you're upset, you know, here's another example of spin.
[00:12:52.374 --> 00:13:08.079]  They will tell new candidates for city council or county commissioner or state agriculture department or governor, they'll tell you, don't be negative, be nice, be friendly, be middle of the road, don't bring up hot button issues.
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:19.109]  But then you watch all the candidates that win, the establishment candidates, they run attack ads, they're vicious, they bring up inflammatory issues, because that's how you win.
[00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:25.795]  But all the while telling you, lay down, lay down, don't be mean, that doesn't work, that doesn't work.
[00:13:26.575 --> 00:13:36.404]  And you've got all these Monday morning quarterbacks and backseat drivers out there who know nothing about politics, but heard something on TV about how you're supposed to be nice.
[00:13:37.566 --> 00:13:47.027]  And they go, oh, Alex, don't be so aggressive about, you know, the Second Amendment or about the open borders or about, just be more reasonable.
[00:13:50.251 --> 00:14:01.517]  And, you know, they tell people I've known who've been candidates who've lost races, and those that listen to good advice and are vicious win elections if you don't have the electronic voting machines in place.
[00:14:01.757 --> 00:14:09.761]  But those that listen to the establishment are just real milquetoast and don't stand out of the crowd and don't affect people, and no one remembers them, and they lose.
[00:14:11.122 --> 00:14:12.083]  Again, spin.
[00:14:12.423 --> 00:14:18.506]  You bought the propaganda of your enemies telling you what the debate is and how to behave and how to act.
[00:14:23.246 --> 00:14:28.608]  And they do this over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[00:14:28.628 --> 00:14:39.213]  It's like the NRA comes and says, you know, we've got to be reasonable and compromise to win these gun cases.
[00:14:40.354 --> 00:14:43.395]  And then you catch the NRA arguing in D.C.
[00:14:43.455 --> 00:14:47.837]  in cases, oh, we're for registering all guns, and then they lose the case.
[00:14:48.277 --> 00:14:51.999]  Or you catch them in Illinois and Texas trying to, you know, go against...
[00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:56.151]  Vermont-style concealed carries.
[00:14:58.192 --> 00:15:01.434]  And you buy the spin and you incrementally lose your Second Amendment.
[00:15:05.717 --> 00:15:11.840]  Well, the same thing goes for distractions or bait-and-switch.
[00:15:13.861 --> 00:15:15.062]  It's what the magician does.
[00:15:15.102 --> 00:15:20.085]  Look at my lovely assistant while I do the sleight of hand right in front of you.
[00:15:21.593 --> 00:15:27.138]  The troops have been complaining en masse about how most of their Humvees are basically tinfoil.
[00:15:30.522 --> 00:15:33.084]  And they drive around getting killed on a routine basis.
[00:15:34.445 --> 00:15:35.086]  Because of it.
[00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:46.597]  And then the embedded reporters, who aren't embedded very long if they ever run a critical article,
[00:15:47.631 --> 00:15:47.991]  We're good to go.
[00:15:48.011 --> 00:15:48.451]  We're good to go.
[00:16:18.007 --> 00:16:19.870]  Folks, they could have had all this set up.
[00:16:20.311 --> 00:16:25.279]  They have this war plan years ago, their own documents, but they'd rather have all the money go to Halliburton and others.
[00:16:27.503 --> 00:16:29.666]  Or for, you know, B-2 bombers, not for armor.
[00:16:32.818 --> 00:16:35.359]  And so these are, you know, the troops wouldn't get up and imperil.
[00:16:35.379 --> 00:16:42.260]  These were officers getting up and imperil their careers and do all this, you know, just because some reporter told them something.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:47.642]  You know, they're so weak-minded that the reporter told them this and put them under mind control.
[00:16:47.662 --> 00:16:56.244]  This evil communist reporter, as, you know, Rush and others have implied, and then under mind control that they went up there and asked these questions.
[00:16:56.504 --> 00:16:56.784]  And see...
[00:16:57.651 --> 00:17:02.553]  The debate, regardless of where the questions came from, would be, why aren't their vehicles armored?
[00:17:04.554 --> 00:17:06.775]  Or why are they getting bad food and bad water?
[00:17:07.756 --> 00:17:12.698]  But see, instead now the whole debate is, oh, this wasn't the troops, it was the reporter.
[00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:16.800]  You see, that's spin.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.702]  And so people that don't want to face up to this, they can just...
[00:17:21.733 --> 00:17:25.015]  Have this psychological excuse to divert off into something else.
[00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:36.523]  See, good propaganda, good programming plays to your own rationales, plays to your own denial, plays to your own defense mechanisms.
[00:17:38.664 --> 00:17:42.587]  And so it's always there making excuses for you not to face up to what's happening.
[00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:50.292]  Always, it's a disassociative disorder.
[00:17:51.471 --> 00:17:52.031]  It's what it is.
[00:17:54.333 --> 00:17:55.554]  People disassociate.
[00:17:55.594 --> 00:18:01.717]  That is, when you give somebody a real issue, they will divert off of it.
[00:18:01.797 --> 00:18:02.338]  Deny it.
[00:18:03.058 --> 00:18:04.839]  They will automatically distract themselves.
[00:18:04.879 --> 00:18:06.200]  Their eyes will glaze over.
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.361]  This is what you see with spectators.
[00:18:08.842 --> 00:18:10.443]  With a nation of spectators.
[00:18:15.005 --> 00:18:16.586]  Here's another example of spin.
[00:18:17.227 --> 00:18:18.688]  And I predicted this spin.
[00:18:19.488 --> 00:18:21.009]  Because everything is the Arabs.
[00:18:21.736 --> 00:18:24.957]  I mean, if a cloud comes over your city and rains on you, it's the Arabs.
[00:18:27.278 --> 00:18:32.920]  And again, folks, I'm not defending the butcherous, larcenous governments over the Arabs put in by our own government.
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.741]  I'm not defending the anti-Christian stance of a lot of Muslims and the Muslim countries.
[00:18:37.361 --> 00:18:40.683]  I'm just stating the facts of our own propaganda.
[00:18:41.543 --> 00:18:42.723]  That's another thing of spin.
[00:18:42.763 --> 00:18:46.765]  It's either good or bad, or they're good, we're bad, we're bad, they're good.
[00:18:46.805 --> 00:18:47.145]  No, no, no.
[00:18:47.305 --> 00:18:50.466]  You have to look at it across the full spectrum of data.
[00:18:51.812 --> 00:18:59.597]  But I predicted, I said, when the dollar really starts tanking and people finally figure out what it means to have a weak dollar, it will be blamed on the Arabs.
[00:19:01.719 --> 00:19:06.942]  Oh, those dirty Arabs did it by dumping the dollar and investing in euros.
[00:19:06.962 --> 00:19:15.568]  Well, the Arabs are a small portion of the Chinese and the Japanese and the British and the Dutch and the French and the Germans.
[00:19:15.688 --> 00:19:19.171]  All of them, they own the majority of our dollars, not the Arabs.
[00:19:20.197 --> 00:19:23.720]  And they started the dumping, and our own government said, yes, good dump.
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.021]  We want the dollar to go down.
[00:19:26.282 --> 00:19:26.963]  But I predicted.
[00:19:27.003 --> 00:19:27.804]  I said, you watch.
[00:19:28.124 --> 00:19:33.268]  When people finally get stung by this, there'll be a bunch of articles about how the Arabs are doing.
[00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.252]  And yes, indeed, they're now all over the news.
[00:19:39.254 --> 00:19:41.415]  Because they can't have you blame your own government.
[00:19:41.716 --> 00:19:45.099]  And they know you won't remember Bush two years ago saying you wanted a weak dollar.
[00:19:46.059 --> 00:19:47.741]  And then last month not propping it up.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:54.607]  So you'll feel good even as you lose everything you've got because it'll be the Ameribs and you'll look at Bush and love him.
[00:19:55.208 --> 00:19:56.590]  See, that's spin, folks.
[00:19:57.451 --> 00:19:58.111]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:03.077 --> 00:20:03.618]  Hi, folks.
[00:20:03.678 --> 00:20:05.420]  Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.722]  The real money, folks.
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.941]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:20:12.441 --> 00:20:13.422]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:20:13.502 --> 00:20:14.883]  The Dow has ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[00:20:14.923 --> 00:20:15.363]  A 5% increase.
[00:20:15.964 --> 00:20:17.685]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the Euro.
[00:20:17.705 --> 00:20:20.066]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[00:20:20.086 --> 00:20:21.827]  Gold has gone from the $390s to the $440s.
[00:20:21.847 --> 00:20:23.128]  A 16% increase in real money.
[00:20:37.383 --> 00:20:38.624]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[00:21:01.374 --> 00:21:04.855]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.

[00:21:27.783 --> 00:21:33.126]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:21:33.266 --> 00:21:37.028]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:21:37.408 --> 00:21:39.289]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:21:39.329 --> 00:21:41.510]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.

[00:22:10.004 --> 00:22:12.445]  The worst part is there's no good talk radio to listen to.
[00:22:12.605 --> 00:22:15.867]  But that doesn't matter to me anymore, thanks to the good people at Freeway Radio.
[00:22:16.027 --> 00:22:19.148]  I've got the Sony shortwave car stereo from Freeway Radio.

[00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:13.353]  And of course, we don't just have double think and spin.
[00:24:13.913 --> 00:24:15.854]  There's many other forms of propaganda.
[00:24:16.195 --> 00:24:18.236]  But double think, here's an example of double think.
[00:24:19.867 --> 00:24:21.008]  Bill Clinton is evil.
[00:24:21.048 --> 00:24:22.850]  He wants to put women in frontline combat.
[00:24:23.731 --> 00:24:26.834]  Well, Bill Clinton wanted to carry out the global plan.
[00:24:27.615 --> 00:24:28.656]  And it hasn't changed.
[00:24:28.856 --> 00:24:36.023]  Bush is in, and now he's actually starting to put women in frontline combat at levels much higher than what Lord Clinton tried.
[00:24:37.184 --> 00:24:39.666]  And if you speak out against it, you are an evil liberal.
[00:24:41.328 --> 00:24:42.269]  See, that's double things.
[00:24:43.826 --> 00:24:48.550]  Bush wants the assault weapons ban, and people go, well, I guess it must be needed.
[00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:54.476]  But if Bill Clinton was doing it, you'd be frothing and freaking out and losing sleep and marching and demonstrating.
[00:24:55.677 --> 00:24:57.378]  See, that's double think right there.
[00:25:00.081 --> 00:25:01.642]  I'll give you another example of double think.
[00:25:01.662 --> 00:25:07.728]  People who work for the government a lot of times are more bigger defenders of it because they think they're part of the power system.
[00:25:08.769 --> 00:25:10.090]  But that same government...
[00:25:11.334 --> 00:25:17.575]  But fluoride in all our water, whether you're a cop or a bureaucrat or a doctor or an auto mechanic.
[00:25:18.195 --> 00:25:24.496]  By the way, even more statistics coming out of Europe in cities that have had fluoridation for more than a decade.
[00:25:25.776 --> 00:25:27.697]  They then are able to test the IQ scores.
[00:25:27.757 --> 00:25:33.198]  You get a 10 plus percent drop in IQ in areas that have fluoridated water.
[00:25:33.738 --> 00:25:35.898]  I have a bunch of mainstream studies on this.
[00:25:37.959 --> 00:25:40.479]  But again, you've been drinking the fluoride, so...
[00:25:41.374 --> 00:25:42.834]  Why would you want to stop?
[00:25:43.855 --> 00:25:45.115]  Why would you want to listen to me?
[00:25:45.295 --> 00:25:47.836]  I mean, the government told you mercury was good for you, too.
[00:25:48.496 --> 00:25:49.517]  So it must be good.
[00:25:50.377 --> 00:25:53.658]  The government is now saying extremists are lying about mercury.
[00:25:54.178 --> 00:25:57.039]  And they're lying to you because it's really nutritious.
[00:25:57.139 --> 00:25:59.740]  And we're bad because we lied to you.
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.880]  Why don't you just believe them?
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.321]  You know, they've only lied to you thousands of times where they've been caught.
[00:26:05.341 --> 00:26:07.382]  It's okay.
[00:26:08.502 --> 00:26:11.683]  Robert in Denver, then John, Steve, Bob, Ernie, and others.
[00:26:11.763 --> 00:26:13.003]  Robert, go ahead.
[00:26:14.744 --> 00:26:15.964]  Yes, good morning, Alexander.
[00:26:15.984 --> 00:26:16.404]  How are you?
[00:26:16.984 --> 00:26:17.805]  Good, I'm all right.
[00:26:18.345 --> 00:26:18.745]  Good, good.
[00:26:18.765 --> 00:26:19.725]  Just a couple things.
[00:26:19.745 --> 00:26:21.726]  My mama doesn't even call me Alexander.
[00:26:22.226 --> 00:26:23.606]  But you're welcome to if you want.
[00:26:24.106 --> 00:26:26.927]  How about Alexander Emrick Jones?
[00:26:27.867 --> 00:26:30.648]  Yeah, I only got called Alexander when I was in trouble.
[00:26:31.876 --> 00:26:32.896]  Well, you're not trolling me, man.
[00:26:32.916 --> 00:26:33.777]  God bless you.
[00:26:33.797 --> 00:26:34.278]  You're the man.
[00:26:34.498 --> 00:26:35.218]  I'm looking at you.
[00:26:35.378 --> 00:26:40.543]  Well, the reason I occasionally say my full name is there's a bunch of different Alex Joneses.
[00:26:41.183 --> 00:26:41.463]  Oh, okay.
[00:26:41.483 --> 00:26:45.847]  And I'm tired of people calling me up going, you work for the New York Times and NPR.
[00:26:45.867 --> 00:26:46.908]  I hear you.
[00:26:46.928 --> 00:26:50.971]  No, the only way I know that is because I think I was watching one of your first movies.
[00:26:51.031 --> 00:26:51.692]  I forget the name of it.
[00:26:51.712 --> 00:26:55.895]  The one where you went across the country to California and Arizona up to Montana.
[00:26:56.533 --> 00:26:58.314]  You were talking about the government taking over parks.
[00:26:58.635 --> 00:27:01.377]  Anyway, there's a scene in there where you said Alexander A. McJones.
[00:27:01.437 --> 00:27:03.918]  Anyway, I don't care.
[00:27:04.719 --> 00:27:15.967]  Do you remember a couple of months you had a video posted on, I think it was prisonplan.tv, showing Bush at a news conference where he was saying, give me a second of a pop in my head.
[00:27:15.987 --> 00:27:16.588]  Do you remember that?
[00:27:17.509 --> 00:27:20.591]  Yeah, we've got that audio clip somewhere in the computer.
[00:27:21.078 --> 00:27:22.859]  Yeah, I was trying to find it last night, man.
[00:27:22.899 --> 00:27:23.920]  That is so hilarious.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.601]  Is there any way you can either repost that somewhere?
[00:27:26.621 --> 00:27:31.525]  I tried to do a search for it on jonesreport.com, but I couldn't find it.
[00:27:31.865 --> 00:27:32.965]  Maybe it's there, I just didn't see it.
[00:27:33.025 --> 00:27:34.747]  But I just got to have that video again.
[00:27:34.947 --> 00:27:35.407]  It's hilarious.
[00:27:35.427 --> 00:27:39.529]  Well, you want to do a search at presentplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:40.730]  Oh, okay.
[00:27:43.331 --> 00:27:46.332]  Bush literally shat there going, hold on, it's going to pop in my head.
[00:27:46.412 --> 00:27:46.972]  Hold on.
[00:27:47.592 --> 00:27:49.253]  You know this is a scripted news conference.
[00:27:49.273 --> 00:27:50.654]  You should have given this to me before.
[00:27:50.674 --> 00:27:52.434]  Exactly.
[00:27:52.554 --> 00:27:57.196]  And then the transcripts had this as scripted taken out.
[00:27:57.776 --> 00:27:58.736]  Yeah, hilarious.
[00:27:59.076 --> 00:28:00.197]  I'll have to do a search again then.
[00:28:01.877 --> 00:28:11.221]  I understand or read somewhere that here in Denver, or just over in Aurora, which is a suburb of me, Buckley Air Force Base has a lot of black ops operations going on out there.
[00:28:11.241 --> 00:28:12.181]  Do you know anything about that?
[00:28:13.286 --> 00:28:18.750]  I know Colorado is a major center of covert operations, so is Texas.
[00:28:19.351 --> 00:28:19.671]  Really?
[00:28:19.831 --> 00:28:20.912]  So is Florida, yeah.
[00:28:21.532 --> 00:28:25.195]  Well, now that you mention it, I do see a lot of helicopters flying around sometimes.
[00:28:25.215 --> 00:28:25.736]  Georgia?
[00:28:26.396 --> 00:28:35.163]  Well, I mean, most of them are just regular military out doing stuff, but if you hear one that's almost silent and black, that's part of our FEMA forces.
[00:28:35.603 --> 00:28:35.984]  I'm with you.
[00:28:36.404 --> 00:28:37.425]  One last thing, Alex, Tom.
[00:28:38.047 --> 00:28:42.310]  Last week when you had Mr. Trinidou on, which was an excellent interview by the way.
[00:28:42.391 --> 00:28:43.491]  I enjoyed listening to it.
[00:28:43.772 --> 00:28:45.613]  Those autopsy pictures were extremely gruesome.
[00:28:47.932 --> 00:28:49.573]  Mike, you were talking about the bombing situation.
[00:28:49.593 --> 00:28:52.474]  You mentioned, I never even thought about, who I thought was a good guy.
[00:28:52.514 --> 00:28:53.094]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[00:28:53.495 --> 00:28:56.376]  Stephen Jones, the attorney for McVeigh.
[00:28:56.616 --> 00:28:57.876]  You said something about $17 million?
[00:28:57.916 --> 00:29:00.958]  Yeah, that's what he got from the government for the defense.
[00:29:01.398 --> 00:29:02.919]  So, what was his role in this?
[00:29:02.939 --> 00:29:04.599]  Was he just a puppet going along?
[00:29:04.639 --> 00:29:06.360]  Was he not really trying to bring the truth out?
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:06.860]  I don't know.
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:12.643]  He didn't ask for the 12 surveillance cameras that the police had said showed Arabs with Mr. McVeigh.
[00:29:12.663 --> 00:29:14.123]  Why didn't his lawyer ask for that?
[00:29:15.684 --> 00:29:15.744]  Oh.
[00:29:16.365 --> 00:29:18.266]  So he was just basically playing along there.
[00:29:18.306 --> 00:29:21.666]  He had no desire to really bring the truth out.
[00:29:21.827 --> 00:29:23.987]  Well, just look at the case and make up your own mind.
[00:29:25.107 --> 00:29:26.048]  Thanks for the call, Robert.
[00:29:26.648 --> 00:29:27.548]  We've got a guest coming up.
[00:29:27.568 --> 00:29:29.269]  She'll only be on with us for about 15 minutes.
[00:29:29.289 --> 00:29:33.790]  Then we'll go to John and Steve and Bob and Ernie and everybody else.
[00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:41.672]  The websites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowars.net, JonesReport.com, VirginUtah.com.
[00:29:42.792 --> 00:29:43.432]  Why so many?
[00:29:44.213 --> 00:29:45.113]  So much information.
[00:29:51.559 --> 00:29:52.460]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.961 --> 00:29:54.564]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.485 --> 00:29:58.169]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.292 --> 00:30:03.273]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[00:30:03.353 --> 00:30:14.056]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:30:14.436 --> 00:30:18.958]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:30:19.018 --> 00:30:30.362]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:30:30.962 --> 00:30:37.811]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:30:38.191 --> 00:30:40.334]  Your purified water is now ready.
[00:30:40.835 --> 00:30:45.801]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[00:30:46.101 --> 00:30:56.648]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:30:56.888 --> 00:30:57.769]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:31:02.369 --> 00:31:06.972]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glass, who is a pharmacist from Marks Plaza Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[00:31:07.112 --> 00:31:08.313]  Hi, Alan, welcome to the program.
[00:31:08.513 --> 00:31:09.074]  Thank you, Marvin.
[00:31:09.274 --> 00:31:12.616]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[00:31:12.797 --> 00:31:13.297]  Is that true?
[00:31:13.537 --> 00:31:14.538]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[00:31:14.558 --> 00:31:17.540]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:17.860]  price.
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.122]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[00:31:20.162 --> 00:31:20.922]  They're very common.
[00:31:21.022 --> 00:31:24.205]  Those common drugs you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[00:31:24.225 --> 00:31:24.465]  price.
[00:31:24.745 --> 00:31:25.887]  Now, what about Tamoxifen?
[00:31:25.907 --> 00:31:28.350]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:32.356]  Tamoxifen, you can see a 75% savings against the regular U.S.
[00:31:32.396 --> 00:31:32.676]  price.
[00:31:33.017 --> 00:31:35.440]  Now, are these brand-name products made by the same companies?
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.703]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[00:31:37.743 --> 00:31:39.766]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.
[00:31:40.026 --> 00:31:44.927]  So to save money on prescription drugs in Canada, call the toll-free number for your information package.
[00:31:45.207 --> 00:31:47.148]  To find out more, call toll-free 1-800-840-0686.
[00:31:47.168 --> 00:31:47.588]  That's 1-800-840-0686.
[00:31:47.628 --> 00:31:48.868]  Or go on the web at www.canshipdrugs.com.
[00:32:02.481 --> 00:32:04.001]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:04.061 --> 00:32:06.442]  Whether you were aware or not, World War III has started.
[00:32:06.802 --> 00:32:07.682]  Let me rephrase that.
[00:32:08.062 --> 00:32:09.282]  Oil War III has started.
[00:32:09.582 --> 00:32:12.023]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[00:32:12.443 --> 00:32:15.823]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[00:32:16.263 --> 00:32:20.084]  Why else would the US be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[00:32:20.344 --> 00:32:21.604]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[00:32:22.044 --> 00:32:26.545]  The nations of the earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[00:32:26.965 --> 00:32:30.926]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[00:32:31.466 --> 00:32:37.368]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.
[00:32:37.628 --> 00:32:43.709]  Call Ready Reserves at 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the free booklet and what you can do to prepare.
[00:32:44.229 --> 00:32:44.569]  That's 800-453-2202.
[00:32:44.829 --> 00:32:50.471]  After you read the booklet, you will understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[00:32:50.931 --> 00:32:51.151]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[00:32:51.171 --> 00:32:53.552]  Or email your request to ReadyReserves at AOL.com.
[00:32:53.772 --> 00:32:54.032]  That's 800-453-2202.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:13.184]  America and the world is being turned into a police state.
[00:33:14.224 --> 00:33:17.326]  And the threat of terrorism is being used as a pretext to do it.
[00:33:18.115 --> 00:33:21.037]  Meanwhile, nothing's really being done about real terror threats.
[00:33:21.497 --> 00:33:28.901]  That's why I have the website prisonplanet.tv, because we're fighting this planet being turned into a prison planet under tyranny.
[00:33:29.461 --> 00:33:39.447]  At prisonplanet.tv, you can watch all 11 of my full-length feature documentary films in high-bandwidth or low-bandwidth streams, or download them and share them.
[00:33:39.967 --> 00:33:47.351]  You can read my 224-page book, 9-11 Descent into Tyranny, Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror,
[00:33:48.277 --> 00:33:56.104]  And you can also watch my weekly TV reports, all my best radio interviews, and of course special text reports.
[00:33:56.704 --> 00:33:59.226]  If you get a year subscription, it's 15 cents a day.
[00:33:59.246 --> 00:34:02.609]  A monthly subscription is 19 cents a day.
[00:34:02.649 --> 00:34:04.310]  You can also give it as a gift.
[00:34:04.651 --> 00:34:07.773]  We have easy instructions on how to do that at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:34:08.874 --> 00:34:09.635]  We're good to go.
[00:34:09.655 --> 00:34:09.895]  I think?
[00:34:31.198 --> 00:34:32.259]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:34:32.299 --> 00:34:38.505]  You can order now and get it many days before Christmas via UPS and have time to give them as gifts.
[00:34:38.846 --> 00:34:42.149]  Give the gift of reality of unlocking minds.
[00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:47.871]  Toll-free number to order the videos or to call and ask about different specials is 1-888-253-3139.
[00:34:47.911 --> 00:34:50.252]  We're offering some of my films as low as $5.95 apiece.
[00:34:50.272 --> 00:34:50.432]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:34:50.472 --> 00:34:51.992]  We're about to go to our guest.
[00:34:52.152 --> 00:34:53.133]  She's Elaine Donnelly.
[00:34:53.453 --> 00:34:54.213]  We've interviewed before.
[00:34:54.233 --> 00:34:56.614]  She's the president of a great organization called
[00:35:13.268 --> 00:35:17.930]  That deals with military preparedness, the Center for Military Readiness.
[00:35:19.031 --> 00:35:20.451]  And remember Bill Clinton?
[00:35:20.491 --> 00:35:23.173]  He wanted to put women in the military in frontline combat?
[00:35:24.033 --> 00:35:26.894]  Well, that hasn't stopped with George Bush and conservatives.
[00:35:27.555 --> 00:35:34.498]  Kind of a no-no to talk about it when Bush is for the assault weapons ban or for open borders or the size of government growth rate doubles.
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:39.465]  Or when he funds UN operations and signs on to UNESCO.
[00:35:39.566 --> 00:35:42.329]  Well, we're not about Republican or Democrat here.
[00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:43.791]  We're about liberty.
[00:35:44.092 --> 00:35:45.013]  We look at people.
[00:35:45.474 --> 00:35:47.176]  Are they for liberty or against liberty?
[00:35:47.456 --> 00:35:52.704]  And we're basically here to tell you the entire government is overrun with big government pimps.
[00:35:53.690 --> 00:36:06.655]  And joining us is Elaine Donnelly to talk about the new big move, and it's all over the news, from the Associated Press to Newsmax, to put women in front-line combat so they, I guess, can have their heads chopped off and be raped and tortured.
[00:36:07.335 --> 00:36:10.296]  It's a horrible idea, and Elaine, good to have you on with us.
[00:36:10.356 --> 00:36:11.537]  Hi, it's good to talk to you, too.
[00:36:12.973 --> 00:36:15.255]  Just in a nutshell, it's made big news.
[00:36:15.495 --> 00:36:18.498]  They're really pushing the headline, Pentagon wants women in combat.
[00:36:18.738 --> 00:36:19.439]  Tell us all about it.
[00:36:19.859 --> 00:36:22.622]  Well, I'll tell you, this is far beyond what we've seen already.
[00:36:22.782 --> 00:36:30.829]  And let me say at the outset, I do support women in the military, and we've certainly admired their courage and bravery in fighting in the war in Iraq.
[00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:35.394]  Thirty women have been killed already, 27 in Iraq, three more in Afghanistan.
[00:36:35.714 --> 00:36:36.615]  We honor their memory.
[00:36:37.085 --> 00:36:40.046]  My problem is with the policymakers in the Pentagon.
[00:36:40.126 --> 00:36:41.107]  Well, let me be clear.
[00:36:41.707 --> 00:36:45.669]  Understand, I'm saying we don't want women in frontline combat.
[00:36:45.769 --> 00:36:46.249]  That's right.
[00:36:46.289 --> 00:36:56.594]  They're talking about putting women into frontline combat, as defined historically as units that directly engage the enemy or co-locate with those that do.
[00:36:57.290 --> 00:37:01.974]  Now, you are probably aware that the Army is undergoing a process of transformation.
[00:37:02.334 --> 00:37:03.815]  They're going to smaller units.
[00:37:03.835 --> 00:37:07.519]  They're called combat brigades or units of action.
[00:37:07.819 --> 00:37:08.820]  They keep changing the name.
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:15.705]  But basically, it's an infantry and armor unit that is combined, and it has its own support company that's with it all the time.
[00:37:16.246 --> 00:37:21.430]  The plan is to put women into those forward support companies, regardless of the consequences.
[00:37:22.151 --> 00:37:26.074]  We're talking about primarily enlisted women, women who are not prepared,
[00:37:26.573 --> 00:37:30.015]  For the demands of combat, these units have previously been all-male.
[00:37:30.035 --> 00:37:31.777]  This is brand new that they're talking about.
[00:37:32.277 --> 00:37:36.300]  And it's starting with the 3rd Infantry that's about to be deployed from Fort Stewart, Georgia.
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.962]  It's been going on for months surreptitiously.
[00:37:39.842 --> 00:37:42.484]  We have countered each one of these plans as they have come up.
[00:37:43.325 --> 00:37:51.370]  One of them involved a slide presentation made at the Pentagon that said that, well, we have this plan, but it might be looked at as subterfuge.
[00:37:51.911 --> 00:37:53.512]  In other words, a stealth strategy.
[00:37:54.148 --> 00:37:56.789]  Denying that anything has changed when it really has changed.
[00:37:56.989 --> 00:37:59.490]  And they have slideshows, basically, on a lot of people.
[00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:01.411]  Ma'am, are you some kind of liberal?
[00:38:02.231 --> 00:38:03.751]  Being against women in front line?
[00:38:03.771 --> 00:38:04.952]  Because that's liberal now.
[00:38:05.572 --> 00:38:08.893]  Being against women in front line combat is evil and liberal.
[00:38:09.173 --> 00:38:09.473]  Really?
[00:38:09.554 --> 00:38:10.434]  I hadn't heard that.
[00:38:10.594 --> 00:38:13.635]  Because the liberal women have been pushing for this for a long time.
[00:38:13.675 --> 00:38:14.855]  Yeah, I'm being sarcastic.
[00:38:15.296 --> 00:38:17.456]  Yeah, no, I'm being totally sarcastic.
[00:38:17.516 --> 00:38:22.078]  There are some generals, especially mid-level generals, who have daughters in the Army.
[00:38:22.808 --> 00:38:29.510]  And they seem to think that this is the way to honor and respect their daughter, and it's just the most ludicrous argument you could ever make.
[00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:32.911]  Well, let me stop and explain why I was being sarcastic.
[00:38:33.371 --> 00:38:35.712]  Everyone pulled their hair out, freaked out.
[00:38:35.732 --> 00:38:51.496]  It was the top issue for many months off and on, for four years, eight years, really, of Bill Clinton in office when he was trying all this, and now this is actually happening, and the conservative neocon mouthpieces won't talk about it.
[00:38:51.836 --> 00:38:55.059]  Well, you know, people need to get in touch with the President.
[00:38:55.159 --> 00:38:57.801]  They should go to our website first and get all the details.
[00:38:57.921 --> 00:38:59.443]  It's at www.cmrlink.org.
[00:39:02.586 --> 00:39:05.588]  Again, www.cmrlink.org.
[00:39:06.168 --> 00:39:09.390]  And ask the President, why are you allowing the Army to do this?
[00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:15.573]  And Mr. Rumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense, Mr. Rumsfeld, why are you allowing the Army to do this?
[00:39:15.713 --> 00:39:18.775]  It is a violation of current Defense Department policy.
[00:39:18.815 --> 00:39:19.776]  Let's go over this.
[00:39:19.896 --> 00:39:21.096]  The Russians have tried it.
[00:39:21.116 --> 00:39:22.357]  The Israelis have tried it.
[00:39:23.057 --> 00:39:24.078]  It doesn't work.
[00:39:25.299 --> 00:39:36.644]  Men behave differently when a woman gets their guts blown out next to them, and if a man does, women have higher infection rates in field when men are even having high rates of it.
[00:39:36.864 --> 00:39:41.746]  It destroys unit cohesion in a front-line combat situation.
[00:39:42.027 --> 00:39:44.128]  High levels of the women end up getting pregnant.
[00:39:44.468 --> 00:39:46.409]  It causes feuds and infighting.
[00:39:46.809 --> 00:39:49.570]  I mean, men have always marched off on hunting trips.
[00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:54.371]  Or on forays of raiding and warfare.
[00:39:54.391 --> 00:39:56.231]  This is our basic coding.
[00:39:57.191 --> 00:40:00.672]  And this goes against... Why does the government want to do this?
[00:40:01.332 --> 00:40:10.554]  Well, as I said, there is no good reason for doing this other than the fact that some bureaucrats apparently didn't recruit enough male soldiers, they're saying.
[00:40:10.934 --> 00:40:14.575]  So we're going to send off a lot of young women and young mothers to fight our war instead.
[00:40:15.151 --> 00:40:24.984]  But the case against women in combat that was put together by the Presidential Commission on which I served has many different reasons, and I can boil down the physical issues with only one sentence.
[00:40:25.024 --> 00:40:26.847]  Well, a woman can't... Listen, listen.
[00:40:27.087 --> 00:40:28.689]  You know, I was... I weighed 240 pounds...
[00:40:30.382 --> 00:40:43.936]  And I was in a scene in a movie that's coming out where this SWAT team takes me out, and these were former professional football players, and a couple of the scenes in like ten takes, they had trouble picking me up and carrying me and throwing me in a SWAT vehicle.
[00:40:44.557 --> 00:40:45.778]  Now these are big men.
[00:40:46.278 --> 00:40:53.406]  We've got a lot of big soldiers who weigh more than I do, and I'm sorry, 98% of women aren't going to be able to pick up a man.
[00:40:53.766 --> 00:40:54.027]  Yes.
[00:40:54.107 --> 00:41:07.926]  Well, I saw a live-fire exercise at Fort Bragg when I was on the Presidential Commission, and I saw a male soldier hoist another one over his shoulder, fully loaded, weapons, ammunition, the whole thing, took him off the battlefield, just one soldier carrying another soldier.
[00:41:08.447 --> 00:41:12.332]  And I said, just out of curiosity, wouldn't you have a stretcher, two soldiers?
[00:41:12.352 --> 00:41:14.774]  And I asked the question just to find out what they would say.
[00:41:14.794 --> 00:41:19.820]  And I said, oh no, when you're under fire, you get out of there as fast as you can and you take your body with you.
[00:41:20.261 --> 00:41:28.270]  Well, a woman is at a disadvantage and the man that she would try to carry is probably not going to make it because she won't be able to accomplish that task.
[00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:31.052]  She doesn't have the physical capability to do it.
[00:41:31.673 --> 00:41:35.396]  There's also a whole series of social issues, as you mentioned.
[00:41:35.456 --> 00:41:37.057]  People are attracted to each other.
[00:41:37.437 --> 00:41:40.600]  Personal relationships do interfere with unit cohesion.
[00:41:41.801 --> 00:41:48.467]  Bottom line is, women don't have an equal opportunity to survive or to help fellow soldiers survive in a combat environment.
[00:41:48.767 --> 00:41:53.731]  But all of this is being thrown overboard because of some bureaucrats who didn't plan for enough male soldiers
[00:41:54.298 --> 00:41:56.399]  And some generals who have daughters in the Army.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:03.043]  I'll tell you, it is really very frightening to see this issue treated as somehow less important because it involves women.
[00:42:03.564 --> 00:42:11.508]  And yet it's the people who say they're big advocates of women's rights who are treating it as a very, you know, kind of a cavalier, less important thing.
[00:42:11.948 --> 00:42:22.875]  I'll tell you, if you look at the materials on my website, again, www.cmrlink.org, you will see a serious national defense issue involving readiness, morale, discipline,
[00:42:23.371 --> 00:42:24.152]  All of these things.
[00:42:24.693 --> 00:42:27.356]  But the Army is ignoring this.
[00:42:27.497 --> 00:42:29.619]  The Secretary of Defense needs to intervene.
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:31.301]  The President needs to intervene.
[00:42:31.602 --> 00:42:32.323]  Elaine, they do.
[00:42:32.363 --> 00:42:33.785]  But let me bring up something else here.
[00:42:33.805 --> 00:42:37.750]  This is really important for folks that don't understand.
[00:42:38.487 --> 00:42:39.988]  The Private Lynch case.
[00:42:40.528 --> 00:42:40.729]  Yes.
[00:42:41.009 --> 00:42:45.071]  They tried to use that as a propaganda piece until she came out and said it's a fable.
[00:42:45.712 --> 00:42:46.532]  It's not true.
[00:42:46.592 --> 00:42:48.274]  She didn't kill all these Iraqis.
[00:42:48.314 --> 00:42:50.655]  And I'm not trying to belittle her, but the truth is the truth.
[00:42:51.015 --> 00:42:51.255]  Yes.
[00:42:51.896 --> 00:42:57.179]  And they tried to use that as a case point example to push women in the military.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:57.740]  Yes.
[00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:04.104]  Actually, I admire Jessica Lynch for her courage in going public with what really happened.
[00:43:04.471 --> 00:43:10.076]  The Washington Post, I was very critical of them for spinning up a story that never happened, the G.I.
[00:43:10.116 --> 00:43:11.617]  Jane legend of Jessica Lange.
[00:43:11.637 --> 00:43:18.703]  But again, the Pentagon and the so-called liberal Washington Post working with Bush, why aren't conservatives screaming bloody murder over this?
[00:43:18.723 --> 00:43:24.468]  Well, this story just came out yesterday, and it wasn't even on the front page of the Washington Times.
[00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:29.813]  Certainly there was an excellent commentary on National Review Online by McKubin Owens.
[00:43:30.694 --> 00:43:32.175]  People need to seek that out.
[00:43:32.765 --> 00:43:36.827]  And I'll tell you, the Pentagon strategy is to hope that no one is noticing.
[00:43:37.207 --> 00:43:41.069]  Well, we've not only been noticing, my organization, we've been countering this for months.
[00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:48.773]  But now we're at a point where this division is about to deploy to Iraq late January, early February.
[00:43:49.393 --> 00:43:54.836]  Women are being supposedly trained to be in these forward support companies that co-locate with the combat units.
[00:43:55.397 --> 00:43:56.217]  Once that happens,
[00:43:56.696 --> 00:43:59.598]  I can tell you, the Army is already declaring it a big success.
[00:43:59.878 --> 00:44:01.538]  And the unit hasn't even deployed yet.
[00:44:01.799 --> 00:44:04.240]  Basically, yeah, that's propaganda for you.
[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:19.948]  Basically, you're going to have women in areas like Fallujah, in these bases, and the men are going to be so busy going after them, and so busy in the woodshed, that when they come under attack, it's going to cause higher levels of casualties.
[00:44:20.128 --> 00:44:23.590]  Well, any way you look at it, this is not going to help those combat units.
[00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:26.111]  It certainly is not fair to women in the military.
[00:44:26.485 --> 00:44:39.515]  Did you know that in a series of surveys done by the Army over a period of 10 years, every year, they ask the question of enlisted women and men, do you want to be treated exactly like the men in going into combat?
[00:44:39.535 --> 00:44:42.918]  90% of the enlisted women are opposed.
[00:44:43.398 --> 00:44:47.361]  And it's been similar figures for 10 years, a whole decade.
[00:44:47.741 --> 00:44:48.462]  So what do they do?
[00:44:48.602 --> 00:44:50.123]  They just stopped asking the question.
[00:44:50.143 --> 00:44:51.844]  Well, let me ask you another question.
[00:44:52.925 --> 00:44:54.787]  I've read that on ships and in bases...
[00:44:55.999 --> 00:45:03.109]  I mean, it's enough of your privacy to give up to go into the latrine right next to men a foot away.
[00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:10.899]  But I can't imagine for the women and the men having to all be naked around each other, have to be in the bathrooms together.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:20.944]  I mean, it's degrading, and they're even trying in some public schools to make people go into the same bathroom, and in colleges.
[00:45:21.484 --> 00:45:24.526]  I mean, this is sickening social engineering.
[00:45:24.646 --> 00:45:31.629]  Well, again, the military, it's a tough life as it is, and in support units we have some separation of men and women.
[00:45:32.028 --> 00:45:38.637]  But let's face it, in close combat, infantry armor doing what they were doing in Fallujah, privacy, I mean, what's that?
[00:45:39.218 --> 00:45:42.282]  It's the kind of a thing, everything is more intense in close combat.
[00:45:42.322 --> 00:45:45.807]  But why do these social... You don't make the job harder for those soldiers.
[00:45:46.007 --> 00:45:47.570]  Why do these social engineers...
[00:45:48.782 --> 00:45:50.903]  They want to do this.
[00:45:51.103 --> 00:45:52.564]  I know you say they want more people.
[00:45:52.604 --> 00:45:57.485]  They want to be able to draft women and pull all of this in the future, but it just doesn't work.
[00:45:57.526 --> 00:45:59.126]  Do they want to destroy the military?
[00:45:59.786 --> 00:46:06.669]  Again, I think there are some people who have bought into this notion that men and women are interchangeable in all positions.
[00:46:07.289 --> 00:46:17.013]  That is a philosophy that was dominant in the Clinton years, and many of the generals who are in positions of authority now pretty much had to implement that philosophy.
[00:46:17.495 --> 00:46:31.509]  That's why the Army went to co-ed basic training, knowing that it's less efficient, that it's less desirable for both men and women soldiers, and they've held on to it, even though they should have gotten rid of it a long time ago and had separate gender training like the Marines do.
[00:46:31.769 --> 00:46:40.198]  But we all heard that this was the evil liberals, and then I want to point out that it's Bush and Rumsfeld, and I want people to get that through their heads.
[00:46:40.831 --> 00:46:44.552]  Well, Mr. Rumsfeld really hasn't spoken on this issue yet, and that's the problem.
[00:46:44.972 --> 00:46:46.472]  He needs to speak out.
[00:46:46.512 --> 00:46:47.273]  He needs to watch.
[00:46:47.313 --> 00:46:48.713]  Well, he's clearly for it.
[00:46:49.333 --> 00:46:50.313]  He's clearly for it.
[00:46:50.353 --> 00:46:51.173]  He's in command.
[00:46:51.213 --> 00:46:52.614]  Well, I don't know that yet.
[00:46:52.934 --> 00:46:55.614]  I have requested meetings with certain people to find out.
[00:46:56.335 --> 00:47:01.816]  As I say, we've managed to resist this for many months, but now they're still going ahead with it anyway.
[00:47:01.836 --> 00:47:06.857]  There have been briefings made to Congress, which are quoted and analyzed on my website.
[00:47:07.267 --> 00:47:08.688]  So what are they going to do when we get...
[00:47:30.049 --> 00:47:32.631]  Okay, so out of the 1,000 plus dead troops, 30 of them are women.
[00:47:32.651 --> 00:47:34.852]  What are they going to do as those numbers get higher and higher?
[00:47:35.172 --> 00:47:47.820]  Well, I'll tell you, it's a tragedy when any of our soldiers die, but when you cause more soldiers to die because of poor planning, because of personnel policies that make no sense, that is indefensible.
[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:53.543]  And yet these Pentagon bureaucrats, as I say, they seem to have bought into this gender-free military notion that
[00:47:53.908 --> 00:47:55.569]  was so big in the Clinton years.
[00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:59.032]  Somebody needs to give them a strong reality check.
[00:47:59.552 --> 00:48:04.275]  But somebody, the President, the Secretary of Defense needs to intervene and say, what are you doing?
[00:48:04.695 --> 00:48:05.656]  You're not going to do this.
[00:48:05.696 --> 00:48:14.422]  And oh, by the way, if the combat restrictions, all of them, are eliminated, first co-location, then all the restrictions, because you can't retain one over the other,
[00:48:14.904 --> 00:48:27.110]  Then you're going to have to do the same thing with special forces, with the Marine Corps, and once that happens, then the ACLU goes back to court and they say, well, why are women exempt from registration for the draft?
[00:48:27.691 --> 00:48:32.393]  That exemption has always been tied to the fact that women are not used in land combat.
[00:48:32.433 --> 00:48:35.955]  But the new legislation, the Universal Service Act...
[00:48:36.853 --> 00:48:37.533]  Well, thank you.
[00:48:37.573 --> 00:48:38.554]  I appreciate being on your show today.
[00:48:38.574 --> 00:48:38.894]  Take care.
[00:48:38.914 --> 00:48:39.034]  Bye.
[00:48:39.054 --> 00:48:39.734]  There you go.
[00:48:39.754 --> 00:48:44.216]  Another example, whether it's open borders or gun control, regulation and all of it, George Bush, Al Clinton and Clinton,
[00:49:07.014 --> 00:49:10.418]  And, you know, this cop-out of, well, Rumsfeld won't say or Bush won't say.
[00:49:11.078 --> 00:49:16.984]  It's like saying, well, they're going to put satellite boxes and attach you in the cars, but Schwarzenegger won't say how he's for it.
[00:49:17.024 --> 00:49:18.666]  It's just his new DMV head's doing it.
[00:49:18.706 --> 00:49:20.748]  You know, oh, it's not the great leader doing it.
[00:49:21.088 --> 00:49:21.569]  Yes, it is.
[00:49:23.024 --> 00:49:28.405]  So see, you never really cared, neocon followers, about not having women in frontline combat.
[00:49:28.425 --> 00:49:29.765]  You just like to hate Bill Clinton.
[00:49:30.185 --> 00:49:34.186]  And then when Bush protected Bill Clinton with Pardongate blocking that, you love that too.
[00:49:34.286 --> 00:49:35.486]  You hate America.
[00:49:35.606 --> 00:49:37.047]  You love abortion.
[00:49:37.147 --> 00:49:37.907]  You love evil.
[00:49:38.327 --> 00:49:40.407]  Let's go ahead and talk to, who's up next here?
[00:49:44.168 --> 00:49:45.048]  Bob in Michigan.
[00:49:45.068 --> 00:49:45.728]  You're on the air.
[00:49:45.788 --> 00:49:46.508]  Go ahead, Bob.
[00:49:46.528 --> 00:49:47.529]  Yes, sir.
[00:49:47.929 --> 00:49:48.269]  Hello.
[00:49:48.669 --> 00:49:49.069]  How you doing?
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:58.663]  We've been seeing a lot of the news about the United Nations, oil for food, trying to make coffee and responsible.
[00:49:59.743 --> 00:50:00.904]  And again, that's the spin.
[00:50:00.964 --> 00:50:02.024]  Halliburton's involved.
[00:50:02.044 --> 00:50:02.805]  Dick Cheney's involved.
[00:50:02.825 --> 00:50:04.005]  They're all a bunch of crooks.
[00:50:04.325 --> 00:50:04.825]  Right.
[00:50:04.845 --> 00:50:07.466]  They're putting the pressure on him to bring Bill Clinton in later.
[00:50:07.886 --> 00:50:15.829]  Well, I'm sitting here thinking because I analyze everything, read between the lines if I can, and I believe they're trying to poison the
[00:50:16.437 --> 00:50:19.578]  United Nations, and they're going to say, we're going to revamp this.
[00:50:20.218 --> 00:50:21.018]  We're going to improve it.
[00:50:21.298 --> 00:50:22.819]  Oh, well, then your analysis is correct.
[00:50:22.839 --> 00:50:25.039]  They just came out with a revamp plan for the UN.
[00:50:25.059 --> 00:50:27.660]  Something worse is going to come out of it.
[00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:33.641]  And I recall a map that I had that showed the world divided into seven districts, seven areas.
[00:50:34.762 --> 00:50:43.244]  And then I'm thinking about the Book of Revelations where it states that the seven beasts with the ten horns
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:46.503]  And it reminded me of this map I saw.
[00:50:47.364 --> 00:50:51.169]  Well, it's actually ten regions and ten sub-regions per region.
[00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:53.332]  But, yeah, that's public.
[00:50:53.593 --> 00:50:53.953]  Stay there.
[00:50:53.973 --> 00:50:54.974]  We'll talk more about it, Bob.
[00:50:55.055 --> 00:50:56.156]  More calls on the other side.
[00:50:56.617 --> 00:50:57.017]  Stay with us.
[00:50:57.057 --> 00:50:57.738]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:01.497 --> 00:51:05.824]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.004 --> 00:51:10.451]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.591 --> 00:51:14.977]  There is a chance to use this disaster in the New World Order.
[00:51:15.017 --> 00:51:16.359]  The New World Order.
[00:51:18.142 --> 00:51:22.386]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.426 --> 00:51:29.374]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.494 --> 00:51:31.517]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.857 --> 00:51:42.203]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.463 --> 00:51:47.866]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:54:34.601 --> 00:54:39.623]  A lot of people say, a lot of people say, why do they want global government?
[00:54:39.663 --> 00:54:45.264]  Because the corporations are bigger than our governments now, and they want to be the governments.
[00:54:46.645 --> 00:54:56.328]  And so if they can control the World Trade Organization, the IMF, the World Bank, which are all these private organizations, and give themselves governmental power, they are our rulers.
[00:54:57.008 --> 00:54:59.809]  They can then write the laws to shut out any of their competition.
[00:55:01.266 --> 00:55:05.048]  To shut out a middle class from ever developing that will be independent of them.
[00:55:07.249 --> 00:55:11.530]  And that's what we're talking about, and it's happening right now in front of us, and the average American has no idea.
[00:55:13.371 --> 00:55:14.652]  Going back to Bob in Michigan.
[00:55:14.692 --> 00:55:16.012]  Bob, finishing up your points.
[00:55:16.452 --> 00:55:21.414]  Yeah, they say this is a Christian nation, but when you look and see what's happening around us, you wonder.
[00:55:22.415 --> 00:55:25.096]  You have a million-man march on Washington, they get what they want.
[00:55:25.156 --> 00:55:27.537]  You have the gays marching, they get what they want.
[00:55:28.018 --> 00:55:33.060]  When they try to push the Koran and dress like Muslims in the schools, where's the parents?
[00:55:35.261 --> 00:55:45.846]  Well, where's the ACLU in California when they have two-week-long deals where they make them dress like Muslims and pray out of the Koran or learn how to worship Harry Potter?
[00:55:45.866 --> 00:55:47.887]  I mean, yeah, exactly.
[00:55:47.947 --> 00:55:51.108]  No, I mean, this is to break down what existed before.
[00:55:52.449 --> 00:55:53.969]  But where's the Christian coalition?
[00:55:54.009 --> 00:55:55.210]  Where are these Christians?
[00:55:56.272 --> 00:56:06.195]  They're telling you that the Patriot Act is of the Lord, and then they're just mum when it comes to open borders and all the rest of it.
[00:56:08.836 --> 00:56:09.236]  I agree.
[00:56:10.097 --> 00:56:10.977]  Good to hear from you, Bob.
[00:56:12.017 --> 00:56:12.697]  Who's up next?
[00:56:15.518 --> 00:56:16.899]  Ernie in New Jersey.
[00:56:16.939 --> 00:56:17.439]  Go ahead, Ernie.
[00:56:19.211 --> 00:56:19.912]  Yes, good afternoon.
[00:56:19.932 --> 00:56:20.972]  It's a pleasure to talk to you.
[00:56:21.212 --> 00:56:21.813]  Good to talk to you.
[00:56:21.833 --> 00:56:22.833]  Go ahead.
[00:56:22.853 --> 00:56:23.914]  Some positive notes.
[00:56:24.194 --> 00:56:26.856]  Here, sometimes we have to rearrange our brain, I think.
[00:56:26.876 --> 00:56:28.397]  It's true what you're saying.
[00:56:29.097 --> 00:56:39.263]  Like all the laws that have been passed, and yours, too, that was under Byrd, and there was somebody else on the Republican side that stood up against the bill.
[00:56:39.283 --> 00:56:40.244]  They were quite elegant.
[00:56:40.264 --> 00:56:42.065]  Not only that, after the vote,
[00:56:45.285 --> 00:56:51.847]  They had questions on C-SPAN, and like 8 out of 15 were talking about the open borders, shut the borders down, put troops on the borders.
[00:56:51.867 --> 00:56:55.468]  So it's a lot of positive stuff going on.
[00:56:56.568 --> 00:57:03.790]  Well, yeah, but they have loyal opposition like Senator Byrd, who you called eloquent, come up and then kind of put up a weak argument against it.
[00:57:03.810 --> 00:57:07.631]  And you're right, on C-SPAN, most of the callers are bringing up real issues.
[00:57:08.911 --> 00:57:12.872]  But, again, the establishment doesn't care what we want.
[00:57:13.522 --> 00:57:18.384]  They just go ahead with it and then get us off in some fake debate about liberal versus conservative.
[00:57:19.365 --> 00:57:20.245]  We're the people.
[00:57:20.445 --> 00:57:23.727]  The more and more people wake up, we are the people.
[00:57:25.547 --> 00:57:35.072]  Yeah, we don't have to go along with them saying we've got to have an actual ID card or, oh, you've got to go along with a draft or, oh, you've got to... No, we don't.
[00:57:35.392 --> 00:57:36.112]  It's criminal.
[00:57:36.172 --> 00:57:37.433]  It's unconstitutional.
[00:57:37.473 --> 00:57:38.493]  It's un-American.
[00:57:39.134 --> 00:57:42.155]  If the government said we all had to jump off a cliff, we don't have to.
[00:57:45.586 --> 00:57:47.126]  Anything else, sir?
[00:57:47.406 --> 00:57:52.968]  Just final, I think we have to go back to, not that we don't, but put things in order.
[00:57:53.028 --> 00:57:55.608]  God says glorify God first and praise in Him.
[00:57:55.628 --> 00:57:58.049]  It's to say the Lord is made and then things fall in order.
[00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:59.249]  I have a hard time doing that.
[00:57:59.269 --> 00:58:02.510]  You get caught up in so much other stuff.
[00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:03.750]  We do our job.
[00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:06.451]  We have to praise Him first because it says rest.
[00:58:07.191 --> 00:58:07.851]  I hear you, sir.
[00:58:07.871 --> 00:58:08.692]  Thank you.
[00:58:09.012 --> 00:58:09.532]  Take care.
[00:58:09.552 --> 00:58:10.232]  Thanks for the call.
[00:58:11.773 --> 00:58:18.338]  A lot of people go to church on Sunday or on Saturday, and then the rest of the week, they think everything's A-OK.
[00:58:19.979 --> 00:58:23.501]  And their preacher doesn't want to bring up any issues that upset anybody.
[00:58:24.062 --> 00:58:27.504]  He wants to do whatever is kind of milquetoast, middle of the road.
[00:58:28.825 --> 00:58:30.206]  And that's a big problem.
[00:58:30.386 --> 00:58:37.311]  And some of the other churches, why, they're out saying Patriot Acts is good.
[00:58:37.932 --> 00:58:39.513]  You're a devil if you're against it.
[00:58:41.155 --> 00:58:43.157]  So that's where you got a lot of the deception going.
[00:58:43.818 --> 00:58:46.320]  All right, we got more guests and more calls coming up.
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:48.542]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[00:58:51.685 --> 00:58:52.266]  Hello, folks.
[00:58:58.152 --> 00:59:00.434]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[00:59:01.289 --> 00:59:03.511]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:29.466 --> 00:59:32.107]  Welcome back, my friends, to the second hour.
[00:59:33.147 --> 00:59:39.548]  Coming up in 30 minutes, we'll be talking to Vicki Karp, expert on election fraud and leading activist here in Texas.
[00:59:40.228 --> 00:59:46.750]  And then in the third hour, Bev Harris talking about election fraud and chronicling what really happened in the 2004 election and what's coming up.
[00:59:47.470 --> 00:59:50.490]  And we're losing our most basic right right in front of our very eyes.
[00:59:52.431 --> 00:59:57.772]  Right now, we're joined by Dr. Kenneth Sinnott, a Gulf War I vet.
[00:59:59.404 --> 01:00:01.425]  And I have the Quad City Times here.
[01:00:01.725 --> 01:00:14.490]  We interviewed him a few weeks ago, and he's since been to court, and Homeland Security admits that he didn't threaten anybody, but complaining too much was a problem, so they came out and arrested him.
[01:00:16.071 --> 01:00:28.536]  Inspectors from Federal Protective Services, a branch of Homeland Security Department, arrested a Benjerdorf chiropractor Friday, accused of making harassing phone calls to the department,
[01:00:29.279 --> 01:00:39.284]  Veterans Affairs officials in Des Moines, Kenneth C. Tennant, 45, remain in the Polk County, Iowa, jail late Friday afternoon, charged with third-degree harassment.
[01:00:39.384 --> 01:00:52.770]  Although it is a state charge and a misdemeanor, Federal Protective Services, or FPS, personnel were involved because the VA's office is a federal facility, said Special Agent Will Calvey.
[01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:57.712]  The FPS provides law enforcement and security services to more than one million tenants,
[01:00:59.867 --> 01:01:03.349]  And daily visitors to all federally owned and leased facilities nationwide.
[01:01:03.389 --> 01:01:12.293]  According to the mission statement, FPS focuses directly on the interior security of the nation and the reduction of crimes and potential threats to federal facilities.
[01:01:12.893 --> 01:01:18.195]  Calvey said two inspectors from Des Moines had been investigating Tennant after receiving complaints from the VA office.
[01:01:19.796 --> 01:01:23.038]  And it goes on, he had been harassing them over the past three years, said Calvey.
[01:01:23.318 --> 01:01:27.800]  We were looking at the messages, and while there were no direct threats...
[01:01:28.519 --> 01:01:29.840]  The language was abusive.
[01:01:31.481 --> 01:01:37.824]  The specific nature of the calls, or dispute between Tennant and the VA, were not divulged by FPS officials.
[01:01:38.565 --> 01:01:41.626]  And Mr. Tennant had gone on local radio and complained.
[01:01:41.667 --> 01:01:46.209]  He'd called them, and they came out and arrested him.
[01:01:46.249 --> 01:01:51.372]  This is one more example of marijuana dealers, people selling Rubik's Cubes at toy stores.
[01:01:52.493 --> 01:01:54.274]  They're all getting hit by Homeland Security.
[01:01:55.014 --> 01:01:58.076]  People speeding are being charged with federal crimes.
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:00.081]  Being arrested by the feds.
[01:02:02.161 --> 01:02:05.583]  We're about to break, but let's go ahead and bring up Dr. Kenneth C. Tennant.
[01:02:06.503 --> 01:02:09.704]  Dr. Tennant, you've now been to court.
[01:02:10.785 --> 01:02:12.505]  Tell us what's since happened.
[01:02:14.206 --> 01:02:14.486]  Yes.
[01:02:14.686 --> 01:02:21.569]  I went up to court on Tuesday and presented myself.
[01:02:21.769 --> 01:02:27.751]  I had a couple of people there with me who tried to record the proceedings between me and the
[01:02:30.096 --> 01:02:39.178]  The attorney objected to the recording unless we had an order signed by a judge for expanded media coverage.
[01:02:39.198 --> 01:02:40.919]  I told him this was my secretary.
[01:02:40.959 --> 01:02:43.319]  It was not expanded media coverage.
[01:02:43.399 --> 01:02:45.840]  Well, he threatened to bring the deputies in if we didn't.
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.341]  Now, you were in the courtroom at this time?
[01:02:48.521 --> 01:02:50.001]  Well, it wasn't actually the courtroom.
[01:02:50.101 --> 01:02:51.361]  It was a courtroom.
[01:02:51.521 --> 01:02:54.842]  So the prosecutor was trying to get you to plea bargain?
[01:02:59.033 --> 01:02:59.293]  Yes.
[01:03:00.013 --> 01:03:06.596]  Okay, well understand, in those proceedings the judge does have to agree, so I don't want to get off into that all day long.
[01:03:08.716 --> 01:03:21.281]  Interestingly enough, I had called Monday morning the day before and asked what judge this would be before, and I was told by the clerk, and no one set in terms, this is not before a judge, that this is just between the attorneys.
[01:03:23.456 --> 01:03:24.536]  You know, to work out a plea bargain.
[01:03:24.556 --> 01:03:25.057]  Yeah, I understand.
[01:03:25.077 --> 01:03:27.659]  But let's specifically talk about what happened to you.
[01:03:27.679 --> 01:03:30.581]  Because I'm not surprised that the prosecutor didn't want you to record it.
[01:03:30.601 --> 01:03:31.421]  Right.
[01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:33.863]  Well, under the Sunshine Law, we had a right to record it.
[01:03:33.903 --> 01:03:37.926]  But because, actually, the prosecutor didn't even... We've got to break.
[01:03:37.946 --> 01:03:39.347]  We've got to break, Dr. Tennant.
[01:03:39.847 --> 01:03:41.808]  All I'm telling you is, it's a dead issue.
[01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:43.389]  It's not going to go anywhere for you.
[01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:46.972]  So, I want to hear about what they're trying to do to you when we get back.
[01:03:47.552 --> 01:03:48.313]  Please stay with us.
[01:03:48.753 --> 01:03:49.894]  We'll be right back with Dr. Tennant.
[01:03:56.084 --> 01:04:01.569]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:06.554]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:04:06.674 --> 01:04:13.521]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:04:13.901 --> 01:04:20.007]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:04:20.147 --> 01:04:21.348]  There are no side effects.
[01:04:21.528 --> 01:04:22.008]  We're good to go.

[01:05:15.856 --> 01:05:16.256]  We're good to go.
[01:05:34.522 --> 01:05:40.490]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:44.975]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:44.995 --> 01:05:45.596]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:05:52.725 --> 01:05:55.046]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:05:55.206 --> 01:05:58.286]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:05:58.426 --> 01:06:02.327]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:06:02.367 --> 01:06:06.628]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:06:06.949 --> 01:06:10.729]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:06:10.849 --> 01:06:12.670]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:06:15.931 --> 01:06:20.893]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:06:21.073 --> 01:06:24.115]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[01:06:24.295 --> 01:06:27.156]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:06:27.656 --> 01:06:33.779]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:06:34.299 --> 01:06:34.699]  Big Brother.
[01:06:34.719 --> 01:06:35.600]  Mainstream Media.
[01:07:01.167 --> 01:07:02.248]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.909 --> 01:07:03.789]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:05.411]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.871 --> 01:07:09.995]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.255 --> 01:07:14.398]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:17.741 --> 01:07:29.271]  I was just talking to Dr. Tennant during the break, and again, Homeland Security says in the Quad City Times that he didn't threaten anybody, but he called and complained too much, and
[01:07:30.111 --> 01:07:40.218]  Well, he did a local radio interview criticizing the VA, and talking about how he was given all this experimental stuff when he was in Gulf War I, and how he doesn't like it.
[01:07:40.238 --> 01:07:42.200]  Well, that's basically harassment.
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:56.770]  So they've arrested him a few weeks ago, and then they ordered him into court, and then it was a prosecutor trying to make him plea bargain, and then the prosecutor said, I'm taking you before a judge, even though there wasn't a court date that day, because you aren't complying with me.
[01:07:57.859 --> 01:08:00.621]  That's completely illegal right there, but they just do it out of hand.
[01:08:00.661 --> 01:08:01.881]  It's mainstream now.
[01:08:02.982 --> 01:08:07.925]  But to go over blow-by-blow what happened to you, sir, with Homeland Security.
[01:08:07.965 --> 01:08:10.846]  Again, Homeland Security, this is the type of stuff they're dealing with.
[01:08:12.107 --> 01:08:13.248]  Doctor, please tell us about it.
[01:08:13.608 --> 01:08:18.891]  Yeah, well, they showed up at my doorstep with two local police officers banging on my door.
[01:08:18.911 --> 01:08:24.474]  To me, it's early in the morning in front of my 6-year-old son and my 8-year-old daughter and my wife and...
[01:08:26.072 --> 01:08:28.293]  You know, they just manhandled and arrested me.
[01:08:28.313 --> 01:08:28.913]  They took me away.
[01:08:28.953 --> 01:08:30.034]  They said they had a warrant.
[01:08:30.074 --> 01:08:31.234]  I'd never seen anything.
[01:08:31.794 --> 01:08:49.301]  But when I was up in Des Moines there on Tuesday, I finally got a copy of it, and it was signed by a Judge Jacobs, who was basically working with a Commander Berry up there in Des Moines, who was Stephen Formello, the arresting agent.
[01:08:49.941 --> 01:08:51.842]  It's his commander, his supervisor.
[01:08:52.486 --> 01:09:07.874]  Interestingly enough, I'm looking at the warrant and it clearly states on here to any peace officer of the state that you are commanded forthwith to arrest said defendant and take him before the nearest, most accessible magistrate without unnecessary delay.
[01:09:08.154 --> 01:09:09.855]  They took me clear across the state.
[01:09:10.575 --> 01:09:19.880]  And then Stephen Fumillo actually signed a return of service where he's certifying that he did bring me before the nearest, most accessible magistrate.
[01:09:20.527 --> 01:09:21.649]  Nearest to who?
[01:09:21.709 --> 01:09:24.233]  Nearest to their office or nearest to where you live?
[01:09:24.273 --> 01:09:25.295]  See, that's the difference.
[01:09:25.976 --> 01:09:33.388]  Yeah, well, it's not clearly defined, but you would... Common sense would tell you that it says here...
[01:09:34.005 --> 01:09:36.827]  Well, again, that's just the corrupt court systems.
[01:09:36.987 --> 01:09:38.488]  That's just how they operate.
[01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:47.813]  The bigger issue here, Dr. Tennant, is that you're being attacked and focused on for complaining too much, and they admit that.
[01:09:47.893 --> 01:09:56.759]  And I would advise you that when you get into this trial that you demand a jury, and that you bring up as a big piece of evidence, you put on the stand...
[01:09:57.699 --> 01:10:02.321]  The Homeland Security officer that arrested you and you say, did you tell him I didn't harass anyone?
[01:10:02.601 --> 01:10:04.862]  I mean, did you tell him that I didn't threaten anyone?
[01:10:05.363 --> 01:10:20.309]  You know, you've got this guy with the newspaper and then you also subpoena and bring in as a witness the reporter Tori Burchett of the Quad City Times and say, did this Homeland Security officer tell you that I did not threaten anyone?
[01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:21.530]  Anyone.
[01:10:21.570 --> 01:10:33.961]  Well, the way he's got it written up here, I'm looking at the preliminary complaint, and it says that repeatedly communicated with employees of the Veterans Affairs Department without legitimate purpose in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm.
[01:10:34.321 --> 01:10:35.662]  I've got a letter right here in front of me.
[01:10:35.762 --> 01:10:36.343]  Annoyance!
[01:10:36.363 --> 01:10:37.083]  Let me stop you.
[01:10:38.445 --> 01:10:39.886]  You annoyed them.
[01:10:40.306 --> 01:10:41.247]  Understand this, folks.
[01:10:41.287 --> 01:10:42.128]  You annoyed them.
[01:10:42.148 --> 01:10:42.488]  Go ahead.
[01:10:42.528 --> 01:10:44.810]  Yeah, I was just going to say, this is...
[01:10:46.690 --> 01:10:55.745]  It's crazy because I got a letter right here in front of me dated June 18, 2004 and it's signed by the first victim listed here, Donald Eddings.
[01:10:56.105 --> 01:11:00.372]  He happens to be the current director of the VA Regional Office.
[01:11:01.436 --> 01:11:08.259]  If I don't have a legitimate complaint, I mean, why is he sending me mail saying that my case is before their office?
[01:11:08.299 --> 01:11:10.519]  Did you talk to Donald Ittings?
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:11.560]  Donald Ittings.
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:13.541]  I never actually talked to him on the phone.
[01:11:13.641 --> 01:11:15.021]  Let me stop you right there.
[01:11:15.501 --> 01:11:17.602]  That's another reason to throw this out of court.
[01:11:18.062 --> 01:11:22.604]  You have to have the personnel member so you can face your accuser.
[01:11:23.024 --> 01:11:29.588]  Specifically put their name on there and have a sworn affidavit for what specific threat you made.
[01:11:29.628 --> 01:11:36.252]  Instead, you've got as a witness and as the complainant, somebody who you never even talked to.
[01:11:36.532 --> 01:11:39.414]  Folks, are you getting how openly criminal all this is?
[01:11:39.854 --> 01:11:42.375]  Now that is very substantive.
[01:11:42.656 --> 01:11:44.116]  You put him on the stand.
[01:11:44.857 --> 01:11:49.860]  You put him on the stand and when he refuses to show up, they've got to throw it out and you say, did I ever talk to you?
[01:11:50.771 --> 01:11:52.393]  Yeah, this is totally incredible.
[01:11:52.433 --> 01:11:55.698]  I mean, here on one hand they're saying I don't have legitimate purpose.
[01:11:56.178 --> 01:12:04.450]  On the other hand, he's writing me a letter telling me that my claim is in his office before a decision review officer where it had been for years.
[01:12:05.913 --> 01:12:12.796]  I want you to go back and read that where they talked about you don't have a legitimate reason to be calling them, that you're annoying.
[01:12:12.816 --> 01:12:16.277]  So, folks, Homeland Security doesn't have any terrorists to catch.
[01:12:16.557 --> 01:12:18.398]  They've got to go after Dr. Tenet.
[01:12:18.418 --> 01:12:18.778]  Go ahead.
[01:12:19.138 --> 01:12:24.099]  Well, this is what it says, and this is in the handwriting of Stephen Fumillo, the arresting agent.
[01:12:24.139 --> 01:12:28.121]  It says, Repeatedly communicated with employees of the U.S.
[01:12:28.181 --> 01:12:31.302]  Veterans Affairs Department without legitimate purpose.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.563]  And in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm.
[01:12:36.604 --> 01:12:57.121]  And it's got listed as witnesses or victims is Donald Aidings, who's the director, Mitchie Marsh, who is the service center manager, and then there's Thomas Lynch and Alan Detmeyer, who are both coaches who have been full-time employees for the longest time
[01:12:58.088 --> 01:13:05.854]  Donald Eddings and Missy Marsh, they're the people who have just taken these offices recently.
[01:13:05.874 --> 01:13:10.337]  They've had numerous directors and numerous... Well, let me ask you a question.
[01:13:10.357 --> 01:13:12.658]  How many of those four people did you talk to?
[01:13:12.678 --> 01:13:12.718]  Uh...
[01:13:15.442 --> 01:13:16.764]  I've talked to two of them.
[01:13:17.925 --> 01:13:24.213]  So you've never talked to two of them, but they're signing false affidavits then?
[01:13:24.513 --> 01:13:24.794]  Yeah.
[01:13:25.174 --> 01:13:30.160]  They're complaining that you have threatened them when you've never even talked to them.
[01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:32.022]  They're not even saying you threatened them.
[01:13:32.263 --> 01:13:34.666]  You called them too much, and so...
[01:13:35.206 --> 01:13:41.876]  The way it's written up, it says repeatedly communicated, and that would include sending an email.
[01:13:42.276 --> 01:13:49.467]  Any emails that I got from the National Vaccine Information Center where they're publishing, they're pointing to credible...
[01:13:50.532 --> 01:14:05.057]  Well, sir, sir, sir, the Lansing Journal, the Associated Press, major medical journals have all reported that anthrax shot was deadly.
[01:14:05.377 --> 01:14:09.779]  Right, right, but... They shut the plant, hold on, hold on, they shut the plant down!
[01:14:10.459 --> 01:14:10.599]  Yeah.
[01:14:11.917 --> 01:14:13.477]  Bioport, Lansing, Michigan.
[01:14:13.757 --> 01:14:18.538]  Now, look, doctor, I keep jumping in here because I want to keep it focused right on what's important here.
[01:14:19.338 --> 01:14:23.159]  Now, you're with this prosecutor, and what is he telling you?
[01:14:23.239 --> 01:14:27.940]  And then he does take you before a judge, just magically.
[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:28.660]  Tell us about that.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:36.101]  Well, basically, he's wanting me to plea bargain so that they don't have to proceed to court with this here.
[01:14:36.141 --> 01:14:38.882]  They don't have anything to proceed, but anyway, because I'm not
[01:14:39.372 --> 01:14:43.600]  I'm not going for that because I know that I haven't done anything wrong.
[01:14:44.061 --> 01:14:45.344]  So I'm standing my ground.
[01:14:46.686 --> 01:14:48.690]  So he wants to take me before a judge.
[01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:50.474]  He finds a judge to take me before.
[01:14:51.953 --> 01:14:54.995]  And then he just tells the judge that I am not cooperating.
[01:14:55.135 --> 01:14:55.916]  Let me stop you.
[01:14:56.196 --> 01:14:59.418]  Not cooperating is not giving up your right to say you're innocent.
[01:14:59.759 --> 01:15:02.100]  What did the prosecutor offer you?
[01:15:02.601 --> 01:15:06.924]  Well, I didn't even allow him to go that far.
[01:15:06.984 --> 01:15:13.990]  I just objected to everything he had to basically say in this case because of the fact that they are in default.
[01:15:14.370 --> 01:15:16.512]  They haven't shown me any evidence.
[01:15:17.893 --> 01:15:20.855]  They haven't shown me that they have jurisdiction in this matter.
[01:15:21.522 --> 01:15:23.204]  They got false affidavits.
[01:15:23.424 --> 01:15:24.945]  They got everything you need.
[01:15:25.385 --> 01:15:30.990]  And they've got the head Homeland Security officer that arrested you saying you threatened no one.
[01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:32.912]  Pure gold.
[01:15:33.973 --> 01:15:36.936]  Pure gold, pure gold, pure gold in the newspaper.
[01:15:37.256 --> 01:15:39.718]  Then he took you before the judge.
[01:15:39.738 --> 01:15:40.459]  Tell us about that.
[01:15:40.799 --> 01:15:42.581]  Well, I haven't entered a plea yet.
[01:15:42.601 --> 01:15:44.402]  I've told the judge and I've told them before.
[01:15:44.442 --> 01:15:45.683]  I don't understand the charges.
[01:15:45.723 --> 01:15:47.485]  It's not clear at all what the charge is.
[01:15:47.525 --> 01:15:48.626]  They haven't shown me anything.
[01:15:49.694 --> 01:15:56.995]  And so the judge is trying to trip me up and get me under her jurisdiction, you know, the jurisdiction of the court, asking me if I'm the defendant.
[01:15:57.035 --> 01:16:01.336]  So you didn't even enter in as the defendant to move with a motion to dismiss.
[01:16:01.636 --> 01:16:10.238]  You still just held it up, but you're telling me the judge went ahead and set a court date despite the fact that there's no plea entered.
[01:16:10.738 --> 01:16:11.078]  Correct.
[01:16:11.398 --> 01:16:14.338]  You need to put in a judicial complaint on that judge.
[01:16:16.139 --> 01:16:17.799]  Forget not proper procedure.
[01:16:17.859 --> 01:16:18.719]  That's ridiculous.
[01:16:19.586 --> 01:16:19.907]  I know.
[01:16:20.527 --> 01:16:20.867]  I know.
[01:16:21.008 --> 01:16:22.449]  This is ludicrous.
[01:16:22.489 --> 01:16:23.550]  This is just unbelievable.
[01:16:23.570 --> 01:16:25.171]  Can you say judicial complaint?
[01:16:25.732 --> 01:16:26.032]  Pardon?
[01:16:26.292 --> 01:16:27.814]  Can you say judicial complaint?
[01:16:29.575 --> 01:16:30.216]  Did I say?
[01:16:30.236 --> 01:16:30.776]  No, no.
[01:16:30.816 --> 01:16:33.018]  Because you can put a judicial complaint on that judge.
[01:16:33.459 --> 01:16:33.979]  Oh, yes.
[01:16:34.039 --> 01:16:37.002]  That should all... Yeah, I agree.
[01:16:37.022 --> 01:16:41.286]  Okay, tell me about this kangaroo court.
[01:16:42.547 --> 01:16:44.729]  Tell us the name of the sniveling prosecutor.
[01:16:45.296 --> 01:16:49.959]  You know, interestingly enough, the prosecutor at first refused to give his name.
[01:16:49.979 --> 01:16:57.444]  When we asked what his name was while we were recording it, and we have it on record, where he says, well, I won't give you my name at this time.
[01:16:57.504 --> 01:17:00.545]  It's not appropriate, and I want you to turn that recorder off.
[01:17:00.605 --> 01:17:02.567]  Okay, so after you did, what did he say?
[01:17:04.128 --> 01:17:07.670]  He asked us to leave the room so that he could open the file and read it.
[01:17:09.231 --> 01:17:11.112]  He hadn't had time to even look at the file.
[01:17:11.892 --> 01:17:13.353]  Okay, and then you came back in.
[01:17:13.373 --> 01:17:14.194]  Did he tell you his name?
[01:17:15.407 --> 01:17:16.488]  No, not at that time.
[01:17:16.808 --> 01:17:17.849]  Did he ever tell you his name?
[01:17:18.189 --> 01:17:19.630]  Yes.
[01:17:19.650 --> 01:17:19.990]  What's his name?
[01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:22.612]  Eventually he told us his name was Mr. Olu.
[01:17:24.414 --> 01:17:25.855]  So his name is Mr. Olu?
[01:17:26.115 --> 01:17:26.295]  Yes.
[01:17:26.315 --> 01:17:27.596]  Did he ever tell you his first name?
[01:17:28.296 --> 01:17:29.998]  I don't believe I got his first name.
[01:17:30.018 --> 01:17:31.038]  Oh, sounds like a free country.
[01:17:31.879 --> 01:17:32.760]  Secret officers.
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:34.521]  Okay, then you argue with him.
[01:17:34.561 --> 01:17:36.883]  He then says, okay, I'm taking you before the judge.
[01:17:36.903 --> 01:17:37.303]  What happened?
[01:17:37.782 --> 01:17:41.864]  Well, basically, the judge just pretty much rode roughshod over us.
[01:17:41.944 --> 01:17:43.885]  Didn't want to hear any of our objections.
[01:17:43.945 --> 01:17:49.208]  Didn't want to listen to the fact that I've said in the past, I don't understand the charge.
[01:17:50.428 --> 01:17:52.929]  I don't wish to contract with anyone in the court.
[01:17:54.890 --> 01:17:56.091]  I don't agree with any of the actions.
[01:17:56.111 --> 01:17:58.092]  And then she said she thought you might be incompetent.
[01:17:59.072 --> 01:18:04.635]  Yeah, at one point in time, she asked the... I think this was just a ploy to trip me up to act...
[01:18:05.351 --> 01:18:15.833]  To get me to say I understand something when, you know, their meaning of understanding is probably more in line with do I agree with what they're saying, and I don't.
[01:18:15.893 --> 01:18:21.854]  So I didn't want to say that I understood what they were talking about because I didn't want them to misconstrue.
[01:18:22.154 --> 01:18:24.814]  Okay, and then the judge, what's the judge's name?
[01:18:25.614 --> 01:18:27.755]  The judge was Carol Coppola.
[01:18:28.575 --> 01:18:30.595]  Carol Coppola, and then she set a date.
[01:18:30.935 --> 01:18:33.716]  She set a date, February 7th, 10 a.m., room 104.
[01:18:35.894 --> 01:18:38.315]  And then there's not even a plea entered here.
[01:18:38.515 --> 01:18:40.696]  Not even a plea, but I'm all set for trial.
[01:18:41.956 --> 01:18:43.177]  All right, doctors, stay there.
[01:18:43.237 --> 01:18:44.858]  We'll come back and go over this.
[01:18:45.818 --> 01:18:49.519]  You're starting to figure out the new America, folks, and it's happening everywhere.
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:51.180]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:54.767 --> 01:18:59.311]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glass, who is a pharmacist from Mark's Plaza Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[01:18:59.431 --> 01:18:59.831]  Hi, Alan.
[01:18:59.851 --> 01:19:00.672]  Welcome to the program.
[01:19:00.852 --> 01:19:01.413]  Thank you, Marvin.
[01:19:01.613 --> 01:19:04.956]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[01:19:05.136 --> 01:19:05.676]  Is that true?
[01:19:05.897 --> 01:19:06.877]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[01:19:06.917 --> 01:19:09.880]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:10.200]  price.
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.442]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[01:19:12.462 --> 01:19:13.263]  They're very common.
[01:19:13.343 --> 01:19:16.546]  Those common drugs you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[01:19:16.566 --> 01:19:16.806]  price.
[01:19:17.066 --> 01:19:18.247]  Now, what about Tamoxifen?
[01:19:18.267 --> 01:19:20.689]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[01:19:20.909 --> 01:19:24.692]  Tamoxifen, you can see a 75% savings against the regular U.S.
[01:19:24.732 --> 01:19:25.012]  price.
[01:19:25.373 --> 01:19:27.754]  Now, are these brand-name products made by the same companies?
[01:19:28.015 --> 01:19:30.056]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[01:19:30.076 --> 01:19:32.098]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.

[01:19:55.467 --> 01:19:56.507]  The war on terrorism.
[01:19:56.827 --> 01:19:59.608]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:19:59.888 --> 01:20:04.029]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:20:04.450 --> 01:20:05.270]  So what do you do?
[01:20:05.290 --> 01:20:10.191]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:20:10.671 --> 01:20:12.752]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:20:13.272 --> 01:20:27.977]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:53.720]  Gold.
[01:20:54.081 --> 01:20:55.362]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:20:55.622 --> 01:21:01.708]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:21:01.888 --> 01:21:05.711]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:21:06.072 --> 01:21:07.953]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:21:08.013 --> 01:21:10.295]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:21:10.435 --> 01:21:16.661]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets
[01:21:16.681 --> 01:21:17.181]  We're good to go.

[01:22:07.754 --> 01:22:10.697]  My husband had been suffering from a painful hemorrhoid for years.
[01:22:11.057 --> 01:22:13.759]  After the doctor recommended surgery, we didn't know what to do.
[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:17.863]  I ordered Hemtab online, and soon after taking Hemtab, the pain was gone.
[01:22:18.103 --> 01:22:20.005]  A few days later, the hemorrhoid began to shrink.
[01:22:20.325 --> 01:22:20.765]  Miracle?

[01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:58.715]  If I sound irritated, it's not with Dr. Tennant.
[01:22:58.735 --> 01:23:07.739]  I'm just so angry, and we only have 30 minutes to cover this, just a few minutes left of that 30 minutes, to chronicle how corrupt these courts are.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.581]  And this is all admitted.
[01:23:10.601 --> 01:23:11.822]  He didn't threaten anybody.
[01:23:12.002 --> 01:23:13.562]  He sued them over benefits.
[01:23:14.963 --> 01:23:16.204]  And he called too much.
[01:23:17.691 --> 01:23:19.174]  And he emailed them too much.
[01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:20.236]  And it says it.
[01:23:20.336 --> 01:23:28.833]  And then people who he didn't even talk to, who he didn't even correspond with, the director of the big facility, is signing on to the complaint.
[01:23:30.194 --> 01:23:34.898]  And they want to put this guy in jail, this veteran, with no criminal record, for no reason.
[01:23:34.938 --> 01:23:35.958]  They have no conscience.
[01:23:36.098 --> 01:23:45.686]  And then you get before the judge, look, when you go to this trial, you can keep trying to not enter a plea or whatever, and she's just going to do it for you, and then she's going to judge you right there.
[01:23:45.766 --> 01:23:48.708]  You might have a strategy of demanding a jury trial.
[01:23:49.876 --> 01:23:55.859]  And then putting on a case before the jury going, okay, here's the newspaper where they say I didn't threaten anybody.
[01:23:56.079 --> 01:24:02.662]  Here's a correspondence from the people to me saying that I am in a case with them.
[01:24:03.842 --> 01:24:08.184]  And do you want me to go to jail for being given a poisonous vaccine?
[01:24:08.224 --> 01:24:10.165]  Here's a mainstream news article saying the vaccine.
[01:24:12.210 --> 01:24:17.254]  Basically, I don't think there's any jury out there that'll convict you, Dr. Deagle.
[01:24:17.294 --> 01:24:20.877]  But who knows what's going to happen with this judge.
[01:24:21.657 --> 01:24:24.139]  But I hope you put in a judicial complaint on this judge.
[01:24:24.379 --> 01:24:25.180]  Anything else, doctor?
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:34.087]  Well, I just want to comment on the degree of dishonesty within these federal agencies is just insane.
[01:24:35.328 --> 01:24:36.529]  I hear you, Dr. Tennant.
[01:24:38.150 --> 01:24:40.912]  So when you're up before this judge, how is she behaving?
[01:24:42.074 --> 01:25:07.178]  Well, she seemed to be, as far as judges go, she seemed to be, she had a good demeanor about herself, but I mean, she was very cautious and kind of, you know, in retrospect, it seemed like she was trying to trip me up and just, you know, but I mean, she maintained, you know, she didn't display any ill temperament.
[01:25:09.139 --> 01:25:12.682]  Just coldly executing the downfall of America.
[01:25:12.702 --> 01:25:13.662]  Yeah.
[01:25:14.082 --> 01:25:14.983]  I mean, think about this.
[01:25:15.003 --> 01:25:20.127]  We just had a veteran who works for the network walk in and go, Man, Alex, during the break, this is scary.
[01:25:20.167 --> 01:25:24.570]  I mean, if I call and complain to the VA, will I get arrested by Homeland Security?
[01:25:26.971 --> 01:25:28.212]  Well, that's what they're doing now.
[01:25:28.272 --> 01:25:34.857]  The Department of Veterans Affairs is using Homeland Security as a tool to intimidate veterans into silence.
[01:25:35.791 --> 01:25:36.771]  Well, it hasn't worked.
[01:25:36.791 --> 01:25:38.352]  You've been all over talk radio.
[01:25:38.392 --> 01:25:39.593]  You've been in the newspaper.
[01:25:39.613 --> 01:25:43.114]  I don't think they're getting what they wanted out of this, are they?
[01:25:43.134 --> 01:25:46.435]  That goes along the lines of military intelligence.
[01:25:46.455 --> 01:25:48.836]  It's an oxymoron.
[01:25:50.677 --> 01:25:53.218]  Well, so, coming up in February...
[01:25:54.193 --> 01:25:56.414]  I hope people will be there for the trial.
[01:25:57.054 --> 01:26:00.656]  And are you just going to go in and keep denying that she has jurisdiction over you?
[01:26:00.676 --> 01:26:01.676]  Because she clearly doesn't.
[01:26:01.996 --> 01:26:04.617]  They are trying to trick you into going along with it.
[01:26:04.657 --> 01:26:05.598]  They do do this.
[01:26:05.618 --> 01:26:14.921]  Well, I guess they're going to proceed with their rough shot and they're going to go ahead and try to put this on trial.
[01:26:15.101 --> 01:26:15.722]  And because...
[01:26:17.113 --> 01:26:28.981]  You know, I don't think that I could ask the courts to do anything as far as demanding a trial by jury or anything like that, because if I do, then I'm stepping off and giving them jurisdiction over me.
[01:26:29.561 --> 01:26:33.223]  Yeah, but I know people are giving you advice, but that's one avenue of advice.
[01:26:34.024 --> 01:26:36.525]  The problem is these people don't even follow their own rules.
[01:26:37.386 --> 01:26:37.866]  That's it.
[01:26:38.066 --> 01:26:46.432]  I mean, here's a... Kelly Rushie, one of our listeners, gave a Ron Paul speech, 45-minute neocon speech, and one of my videos...
[01:26:47.156 --> 01:26:48.717]  To a state trooper in Kentucky.
[01:26:49.838 --> 01:26:54.923]  And he came and arrested him and bragged and said, I'm arresting you for giving me both those videos.
[01:26:54.963 --> 01:27:00.968]  And the judge said, you're not allowed to give videos of congressmen or anybody else to police.
[01:27:01.769 --> 01:27:02.890]  These are anti-government.
[01:27:03.710 --> 01:27:04.671]  And they charged him.
[01:27:04.711 --> 01:27:06.352]  They wanted to put him in jail for three years.
[01:27:07.253 --> 01:27:10.036]  And he got a jury trial.
[01:27:10.056 --> 01:27:11.377]  The jury found him not guilty.
[01:27:11.857 --> 01:27:13.759]  And the judge and others actually threw fits.
[01:27:14.945 --> 01:27:23.010]  But, I mean, they would love to put a good man like Kelly Rushing, no criminal record, well-known in the community, they'd love to ruin his life for giving somebody a video of a congressman.
[01:27:24.871 --> 01:27:26.312]  This is the mindset of these people.
[01:27:26.332 --> 01:27:27.212]  They could care less.
[01:27:29.253 --> 01:27:34.136]  They're put there to put people in prison to make widgets for the drug dealers that own the prisons.
[01:27:34.436 --> 01:27:42.541]  The drug-dealing cartels own the prisons, the drug dealers own the courts, the New World Order, and then they want slaves for their slave camps.
[01:27:45.032 --> 01:27:55.798]  So, I don't know what strategy you should pick up, but if she just goes ahead and starts entering a plea for you, you can wait and watch it and then resist it and say, no, I do not accept that plea.
[01:27:55.818 --> 01:28:01.822]  Because, I mean, she'll just sit there and go, okay, I give you the plea of guilty, and okay, you're guilty.
[01:28:02.082 --> 01:28:04.143]  They haven't even explained the charge.
[01:28:04.724 --> 01:28:06.865]  They haven't offered me the assistance of counsel.
[01:28:07.426 --> 01:28:11.229]  They haven't done anything in accordance with rules, regulations, laws.
[01:28:11.249 --> 01:28:13.230]  You don't want their assistance of counsel.
[01:28:13.710 --> 01:28:13.970]  Pardon?
[01:28:14.231 --> 01:28:15.952]  You don't want their assistance of counsel.
[01:28:16.552 --> 01:28:23.797]  No, I don't want their assistance of counsel, but they haven't even offered me anything along those lines.
[01:28:23.817 --> 01:28:28.000]  Yeah, because they're used to just totally ignorant people who just walk in and go, yes, my lord.
[01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:28.840]  Exactly.
[01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:31.062]  Hey, doctor, I want to thank you for coming on.
[01:28:31.082 --> 01:28:32.623]  We'll have you back on as this develops.
[01:28:32.643 --> 01:28:33.143]  God bless.
[01:28:33.243 --> 01:28:34.204]  Thank you for having me.
[01:28:34.464 --> 01:28:34.744]  You bet.
[01:28:34.764 --> 01:28:35.565]  You're a great American.
[01:28:36.696 --> 01:28:37.718]  Did absolutely nothing.
[01:28:37.738 --> 01:28:38.819]  They admit it in the newspaper.
[01:28:38.839 --> 01:28:39.741]  Want to put him in prison.
[01:28:44.047 --> 01:28:44.989]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:47.072]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.973 --> 01:28:50.678]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.106 --> 01:29:02.409]  The media is flooded with reports of everything from antibiotic-resistant super germs to the possibility of a flu epidemic due to a vaccine shortage.
[01:29:02.769 --> 01:29:07.450]  If we can't rely on traditional medicines, what are you going to do to keep you and your family healthy and safe?
[01:29:07.670 --> 01:29:11.532]  There is now a scientifically proven alternative called Super Silver Solution.
[01:29:11.772 --> 01:29:14.713]  Super Silver's combination of supercharged silver and oxygen
[01:29:15.013 --> 01:29:21.881]  Has been proven to kill hundreds of bacteria and be at least two to three hundred percent more effective than any other silver product.
[01:29:22.141 --> 01:29:30.710]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[01:29:31.050 --> 01:29:37.337]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.

[01:29:54.065 --> 01:29:55.686]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:55.826 --> 01:29:59.869]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:30:00.069 --> 01:30:02.951]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:03.031 --> 01:30:09.715]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:09.915 --> 01:30:12.918]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:13.138 --> 01:30:15.520]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:25.810]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[01:30:26.110 --> 01:30:28.492]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:30:54.398 --> 01:30:55.878]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:30:56.078 --> 01:31:03.420]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:08.141]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:31:08.422 --> 01:31:18.244]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:31:19.005 --> 01:31:22.669]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[01:31:23.009 --> 01:31:25.492]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[01:31:25.512 --> 01:31:31.739]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:31:31.979 --> 01:31:33.521]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:31:33.801 --> 01:31:34.682]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:31:34.762 --> 01:31:37.764]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[01:31:37.924 --> 01:31:38.825]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[01:31:38.845 --> 01:31:39.065]  That's 800-255-1912.
[01:31:39.085 --> 01:31:42.188]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's food supply updates.
[01:31:42.208 --> 01:31:43.168]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:32:03.423 --> 01:32:07.427]  Alright, we're going to be going to a good friend of mine, Vicki Karp, here in just a few minutes.
[01:32:07.467 --> 01:32:16.515]  And I know that John and Pam and David and William and Don, I know you're all holding.
[01:32:16.555 --> 01:32:17.536]  I'll get to your calls.
[01:32:18.637 --> 01:32:22.641]  There is so much news here that we need to cover.
[01:32:22.981 --> 01:32:23.762]  Just briefly...
[01:32:25.291 --> 01:32:26.812]  I've made 11 films.
[01:32:26.892 --> 01:32:27.572]  I've written a book.
[01:32:27.672 --> 01:32:28.472]  I've published a book.
[01:32:28.853 --> 01:32:36.416]  I carry a bunch of other great videos and books on InfoWars.com as well as PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:32:36.996 --> 01:32:47.501]  And when you get the videos, they authorize you to make copies for non-profit educational purposes so you can get one copy and make 50 copies or 5 copies, whatever your heart desires, and get them out to people.
[01:32:48.981 --> 01:32:52.823]  And the videos have a big effect on unlocking...
[01:32:53.968 --> 01:32:55.049]  Individuals' minds.
[01:32:56.289 --> 01:33:02.993]  The globalists and their media whores have to reapply their lies over and over again on a daily basis.
[01:33:03.473 --> 01:33:05.394]  And they have to cover up new lies for old.
[01:33:08.116 --> 01:33:16.781]  But, with the truth, once you unlock a mind, then they see the paradigm for themselves, and then all the propaganda in the world can affect them.
[01:33:18.042 --> 01:33:20.463]  That's why getting the videos is so important.
[01:33:21.323 --> 01:33:35.191]  Of course, for 15 cents a day, you can watch all 11 of my films, both my books, a bunch of other weekly TV reports, dozens of other great documentaries, for 15 cents a day at prisonplanet.tv if you're online.
[01:33:35.231 --> 01:33:47.698]  But if you're not online, or if you want a hard copy, you can go to infowars.com and go to the shopping cart and watch clips of the films and read about them and look at the different specials we're offering and order them and give them as gifts.
[01:33:49.458 --> 01:33:52.501]  And we have slashed prices on the videos upwards of 70%.
[01:33:53.782 --> 01:33:57.886]  Some of the videos, some of our newest videos, are only $5.95 with some of the specials.
[01:33:57.906 --> 01:33:58.807]  $5.95 to get these videos.
[01:34:03.015 --> 01:34:03.815]  Some of the new films.
[01:34:03.895 --> 01:34:05.716]  Be sure and call to ask about the specials.
[01:34:05.976 --> 01:34:11.038]  We don't have specials on all of them.
[01:34:11.058 --> 01:34:14.680]  1-888-253-3139 is the toll-free number to order.
[01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:15.920]  You can call and ask questions.
[01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:17.481]  No obligation to get the videos.
[01:34:17.501 --> 01:34:20.262]  1-888-253-3139 And, of course, you can also write to me.
[01:34:20.342 --> 01:34:22.363]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:34:33.613 --> 01:34:38.514]  An example is you buy one copy of American Dictators for $19.95.
[01:34:39.115 --> 01:34:41.255]  Each additional copy of my newest film is then $5.95.
[01:34:41.735 --> 01:34:44.296]  If you get DVDs.
[01:34:45.096 --> 01:34:47.457]  $9.95, it's VHS because those cost a lot more.
[01:34:48.137 --> 01:34:50.478]  No excuse not to take action and educate.
[01:34:51.238 --> 01:34:56.639]  And instead of fighting the crowds for your Christmas shopping, why not just give them the gift of unlocking their minds?
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:34:59.780]  Or I guess give them a $20 fruitcake.
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:00.420]  That'll be better.
[01:35:01.361 --> 01:35:02.701]  Let's go to Vicki Karp.
[01:35:03.402 --> 01:35:20.378]  Who a few years ago got involved exposing the electronic voting machine systems and is going to be leading a big demonstration at the Texas Capitol in downtown Austin, right in front of it on the south side of the Capitol, coming up this Sunday at high noon.
[01:35:20.399 --> 01:35:21.540]  I'm going to be one of the speakers.
[01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:23.421]  Vicki, it's good to have you up with us.
[01:35:24.042 --> 01:35:25.944]  Well, thank you so much, Alex, for having me.
[01:35:26.624 --> 01:35:26.984]  You bet.
[01:35:27.224 --> 01:35:29.085]  Just kind of a thumbnail.
[01:35:29.586 --> 01:35:35.569]  Tell us about yourself, how you got involved, a testament to individuals having a great effect.
[01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:40.852]  In the few years you've been involved, all the media coverage, all the exposés.
[01:35:41.252 --> 01:35:43.953]  And then tell us about this demonstration that's coming up.
[01:35:44.794 --> 01:35:45.194]  Okay.
[01:35:45.254 --> 01:35:49.957]  Well, I have you to thank because I was listening to your show when I heard you interviewing Bev Harris.
[01:35:50.017 --> 01:35:51.057]  It was last July, 2003.
[01:35:52.842 --> 01:36:00.770]  About, you know, she had just discovered the D-Bolt software and that you could hack these electronic voting machines in a matter of, I think she had it 10 minutes.
[01:36:00.850 --> 01:36:02.271]  Now it's down to 30 seconds.
[01:36:02.311 --> 01:36:04.033]  You can hack in and change the vote tally.
[01:36:04.053 --> 01:36:05.914]  And I was so amazed and shocked.
[01:36:06.555 --> 01:36:10.699]  I started researching myself and found out that, you know, everything she was saying was true.
[01:36:10.799 --> 01:36:11.239]  I met her.
[01:36:11.259 --> 01:36:11.920]  I called her.
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:12.781]  I met her on the phone.
[01:36:13.294 --> 01:36:14.335]  We've got to be friends.
[01:36:14.415 --> 01:36:23.484]  Now I'm on her board of directors of her non-profit and I just support her work in any way I can and I've become a local spokesperson against electronic voting here in Austin as well.
[01:36:26.086 --> 01:36:31.031]  I just felt that all other issues really tied back into the voting issue, Alex, and
[01:36:32.034 --> 01:36:34.896]  It doesn't seem to matter what side of an issue anybody stands on.
[01:36:34.916 --> 01:36:40.058]  If you think you can vote an official out who doesn't agree with you and the machines are hacked, well, you can't do anything.
[01:36:40.078 --> 01:36:40.699]  You're powerless.
[01:36:40.759 --> 01:36:44.921]  So I just decided to devote my time as an activist to this particular issue.
[01:36:45.841 --> 01:36:53.065]  Well, also, Vicki, we've caught big companies engaging in fraud from California to Tennessee.
[01:36:53.545 --> 01:36:58.068]  We've caught them with convicted felons as vice presidents, convicted felons for computer crimes.
[01:36:59.066 --> 01:37:00.646]  Running elections in California.
[01:37:01.227 --> 01:37:05.308]  We've had engineers quit and say, this thing is totally easy to manipulate.
[01:37:05.608 --> 01:37:14.670]  We have the company saying, you can't look at our software or what we're doing or have a record of how you voted because we're a private proprietary company.
[01:37:14.710 --> 01:37:15.870]  Yeah, but you're in the public trust.
[01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:17.911]  So where there's smoke, there's fire.
[01:37:17.991 --> 01:37:18.471]  We've caught them.
[01:37:18.491 --> 01:37:19.671]  We know fraud's going on.
[01:37:20.271 --> 01:37:23.733]  We know where people are going to lose in the polls, but they're the establishment candidate.
[01:37:23.773 --> 01:37:28.736]  They win with the machines, in some cases like Senator Hagel, who owns his own machines in Nebraska.
[01:37:29.016 --> 01:37:35.039]  But now we see a new type of politician where, oh, 90 plus percent of you are against toll roads?
[01:37:35.359 --> 01:37:35.980]  Vote us out!
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:36.720]  Ha ha ha!
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:39.081]  You know, oh, you're against the National ID card.
[01:37:39.101 --> 01:37:39.581]  Vote us out!
[01:37:39.601 --> 01:37:39.982]  Ha ha ha!
[01:37:40.182 --> 01:37:41.783]  You're against forced psychological testing.
[01:37:41.803 --> 01:37:42.263]  Vote us out!
[01:37:42.683 --> 01:37:45.365]  How do we get these machines removed?
[01:38:12.979 --> 01:38:34.168]  Well, you know, I wish I had one answer for that, Alex, but I think that in the end it's going to come down to individual citizens who get so pissed off that they try to do something, you know, the sort of actions that Bev Harris has been doing, going into county election officials' offices with public information requests,
[01:38:34.888 --> 01:38:35.269]  We're good.
[01:38:57.711 --> 01:39:02.293]  I wasn't able to turn up anything obvious with our heart machines here in Texas or in Travis County.
[01:39:02.313 --> 01:39:03.794]  Because there's no way to look at them.
[01:39:04.014 --> 01:39:08.115]  Well, yeah, I mean, you know, in our case, I think, well, I don't know.
[01:39:08.175 --> 01:39:08.795]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:39:09.056 --> 01:39:15.538]  Without the paper ballot, which is, of course, the biggest problem, you really can't tell unless there's something blindingly obvious going on.
[01:39:15.578 --> 01:39:17.219]  You can't tell if fraud has taken place.
[01:39:17.319 --> 01:39:20.440]  But we have a massive conflict of interest in Austin.
[01:39:21.707 --> 01:39:23.048]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:39:23.068 --> 01:39:28.370]  Tell the listeners, Vicki, about Michael McCall.
[01:39:29.371 --> 01:39:33.092]  Well, Michael McCall, I think, is a son-in-law.
[01:39:33.152 --> 01:39:34.793]  Maybe you can help me with this relationship.
[01:39:34.813 --> 01:39:37.294]  Son-in-law, Lowry Mays, the owner of Clear Channel, yeah.
[01:39:37.791 --> 01:39:38.372]  Right, right.
[01:39:38.412 --> 01:39:41.554]  So, yeah, the ownership ties go back to Clear Channel with Hart InterCivic.
[01:39:41.674 --> 01:39:55.025]  And Hart InterCivic, even though they don't have modems on their voting machines, which makes them a slight bit better than the Diebold, Sequoia, and ES&S machines, they can still be hacked from inside.
[01:39:55.205 --> 01:39:57.647]  There's no way to tell if that's happening or not.
[01:39:57.827 --> 01:40:00.129]  Yeah, you just simply pre-program it.
[01:40:00.670 --> 01:40:01.090]  That's right.
[01:40:01.150 --> 01:40:07.135]  And one thing I wanted to mention, because I only found out about this about two or three months ago after working on it for a year and a half,
[01:40:08.172 --> 01:40:16.599]  The optical scan counting machines that count paper ballots, a large number of those are manufactured by the Diebold company.
[01:40:16.699 --> 01:40:18.400]  And it still gets fed through a computer.
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:19.421]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:40:19.441 --> 01:40:28.108]  So the same software program, the same what they call the central tabulator software that counts the votes on the Diebold touchscreen machines, which have made the news,
[01:40:28.852 --> 01:40:36.754]  You know, they're more famous in the news for their touch screens, but it's actually the same exact hack can occur with optical scan counters that they make.
[01:40:36.834 --> 01:40:41.075]  And so even when you have a recount, they just feed them back to the same machines again.
[01:40:41.435 --> 01:40:52.298]  That's why the only type of recount that does any good is a hand recount, but that's only if there hasn't been time to manipulate the ballots in between the time the recount was requested and the time the recount takes place.
[01:40:52.338 --> 01:40:53.318]  I'm afraid in Ohio...
[01:40:53.931 --> 01:41:11.905]  Although I'm really applauding the efforts of the Green Party and Libertarian Michael Bernard to get that recount going, I'm afraid that their Secretary of State up there, Kenneth Blackwell, has so successfully dragged out this process before that he would allow it to begin that by now, no telling which ballots will really be hand-counted.
[01:41:11.925 --> 01:41:13.566]  The original ones, I really doubt it.
[01:41:13.587 --> 01:41:17.630]  Well, let me go back to Michael McCaul.
[01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:20.352]  Michael McCaul, Janet Reno's personal lawyer...
[01:41:21.284 --> 01:41:23.446]  Anti-gun, anti-freedom, neocon.
[01:41:23.486 --> 01:41:25.468]  I'm sure you love him, so-called conservatives.
[01:41:26.429 --> 01:41:46.947]  This guy, the cover-up artist for Waco, for communist Chinese agents, the guy's way down in the polls, but Lowry May is the owner of Clear Channel that controls and predominantly owns Hardener Civics that makes the machines we have in the three counties that his district is in.
[01:41:48.345 --> 01:41:48.565]  Right.
[01:41:48.585 --> 01:41:48.765]  Right.
[01:42:12.685 --> 01:42:12.925]  Right.
[01:42:13.105 --> 01:42:13.606]  That's right.
[01:42:14.407 --> 01:42:21.633]  So, you know, the kind of monitoring that can make a difference, I mean, I was giving an example of what I did, which I really couldn't, I didn't turn up anything in my case.
[01:42:21.693 --> 01:42:32.502]  However, what an individual citizen can do through a public records request is to request from an election official the individual precinct totals for a county.
[01:42:33.351 --> 01:42:42.313]  And then they can get basically the central tabulator results, which shows the grand total, and add up the individual precinct totals and see if they actually match.
[01:42:42.573 --> 01:42:44.053]  And a lot of times they're sloppy.
[01:42:44.093 --> 01:42:53.275]  I mean, there were scores of counties this year where you'd have 50,000 vote and only 15,000 registered voters, or 30,000 vote and 18,000 registered voters.
[01:42:53.735 --> 01:42:55.035]  There's just masses of that.
[01:42:55.295 --> 01:42:57.156]  One of their favorite tricks is flipping.
[01:42:57.456 --> 01:43:03.117]  They know who's really going to win from polls, and so they just flip and give your victory to the establishment candidate.
[01:43:04.156 --> 01:43:04.857]  There are so many.
[01:43:05.457 --> 01:43:07.819]  I have files that are inches thick.
[01:43:07.919 --> 01:43:10.621]  I've started a new file just since the election, Alex.
[01:43:10.681 --> 01:43:15.525]  It's about two inches thick now of examples of problems that have turned up all around the country.
[01:43:16.346 --> 01:43:28.676]  Bev was telling me, I know she's going to be on at one, and she'll have some exciting information for you, but she was telling me last night in a conversation that there were 90,000 ballots in Ohio that didn't even show a vote for president at all.
[01:43:30.227 --> 01:43:31.487]  Now, why did that happen?
[01:43:32.708 --> 01:43:37.249]  Let alone 100,000 voters who were purged out of the voting database in Ohio.
[01:43:38.389 --> 01:43:46.050]  And then on top of it, it wasn't 178,000 challenged provisional ballots.
[01:43:46.130 --> 01:43:49.971]  It was hundreds of thousands more, and almost all of those were Democrats.
[01:43:50.031 --> 01:43:53.372]  But Kerry, he didn't want those counted because he took a dive.
[01:43:54.187 --> 01:43:57.630]  I'll tell you, I was never... Well, I guess I shouldn't have been surprised.
[01:43:57.670 --> 01:43:58.851]  I know he's still in bones.
[01:43:58.932 --> 01:44:05.758]  I was just hoping he might fight a bigger fight than he did and at least do a better job of pretending he was being the opposition.
[01:44:05.798 --> 01:44:10.943]  But I was really disappointed in how he handled that with his concession the next day.
[01:44:11.483 --> 01:44:16.108]  Where were his teams of tens of thousands of attorneys who were supposed to be
[01:44:16.948 --> 01:44:22.072]  I mean, I never heard another thing about them.
[01:44:22.292 --> 01:44:31.359]  I understand that some of his contributors are kind of upset because they donated money to make sure that every vote would be counted and that he would fight the good fight, but he certainly hasn't done that.
[01:44:31.559 --> 01:44:36.842]  Yeah, $300 million from $100-sized donations, never before been done.
[01:44:36.862 --> 01:44:44.726]  The poor grassroots thought he was... But people ask me, well, if they've got election fraud with the machines, why do they need to have Kerry staging?
[01:44:44.966 --> 01:44:56.953]  Because you have to have the fall guy not challenge the fraudulent results, because he's a fall guy, he's a ringer, he's going to lay down, but still the people are going to go vote.
[01:44:57.717 --> 01:44:58.297]  You understand?
[01:44:58.337 --> 01:45:01.578]  So they have to have it set as a fraud at every level.
[01:45:01.898 --> 01:45:03.818]  And clearly he won Ohio.
[01:45:04.159 --> 01:45:05.739]  Clearly he won New Mexico.
[01:45:05.799 --> 01:45:06.939]  And I'm not a Democrat, folks.
[01:45:07.319 --> 01:45:08.580]  I'm reporting the facts here.
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:12.401]  I believe that's probably right, yeah.
[01:45:12.801 --> 01:45:13.781]  It's amazing, Vicki.
[01:45:13.801 --> 01:45:22.323]  You're probably aware, you'll probably hear the details, but Bev turned up some interesting evidence in a Democratic county in Florida.
[01:45:23.258 --> 01:45:51.128]  In Volusia County, and some people who have been tracking this story already know about it, but having done a Freedom of Information Act request and not having received all the precinct totals, she and Kathleen Wynne and Andy Stevenson went to that county election office to ask for the missing precinct totals, and they were told to wait while they generated some fake copies, apparently, because while they were standing there, somebody took a trash bag out the back door
[01:45:51.955 --> 01:46:05.080]  And one of her helpers, Andy or Kathleen, went back and retrieved that trash bag, found real precinct totals there that had been signed by the election officials that were working at those polling places.
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:10.162]  Each precinct take that they had received had five or six signatures of election officials on it.
[01:46:10.262 --> 01:46:10.682]  And again...
[01:46:10.942 --> 01:46:18.447]  There are hundreds of such cases in the last few elections that are in major papers, but never on the big nightly news, so it's always regional news.
[01:46:18.767 --> 01:46:21.069]  They're so sloppy, they don't even shred it.
[01:46:21.329 --> 01:46:23.290]  They just go throw it in trash cans.
[01:46:23.490 --> 01:46:24.631]  Well, you know what?
[01:46:24.651 --> 01:46:29.174]  It's because no one's ever been checking on them before, and that's why we need... Bev Harris can't do this by herself.
[01:46:29.574 --> 01:46:38.781]  But the mainstream media... We need everybody out there who gives a damn about the vote to find out the process and get out there and start doing this themselves.
[01:46:38.861 --> 01:46:40.862]  I really think that's the only thing that's going to make a difference.
[01:46:40.942 --> 01:46:44.503]  Well, Vicki Karp, you're absolutely right.
[01:46:44.523 --> 01:46:46.043]  I mean, this is a central issue.
[01:46:46.423 --> 01:46:48.124]  People need to start getting involved.
[01:46:49.224 --> 01:46:52.585]  But it's also the mainstream media.
[01:46:52.625 --> 01:46:57.246]  By the time it gets in the news, or say the statesmen here in Austin, it's, oh, there's some problems.
[01:46:57.466 --> 01:46:58.926]  People are upset about problems.
[01:46:59.226 --> 01:47:03.127]  No, we're upset about admitted fraud, folks, all over the country.
[01:47:04.034 --> 01:47:32.223]  And a good place to network and get involved is this Sunday, high noon, south side of the Capitol, where we're going to be having a rally, and you should have these rallies all over the country, and if somebody isn't putting it on, you give your own group a name, you and ten of your friends call the media, send out press releases, get on talk radio locally, call up the station, get on, say, meet us this Sunday, you know, in a few weeks from now, and go down and have your own rally at your courthouse or your Capitol.
[01:47:32.663 --> 01:47:34.624]  I mean, stop playing games, folks.
[01:47:34.684 --> 01:47:39.307]  If you want freedom, you've got to raise the consciousness level about this, Vicki.
[01:47:39.787 --> 01:47:43.229]  I mean, with people like Vicki, who took action.
[01:47:43.249 --> 01:47:45.550]  You've got to be a trailblazer like she is.
[01:47:45.790 --> 01:47:48.011]  Vicki, tell us about this rally that's coming up Sunday.
[01:47:48.911 --> 01:47:57.836]  Well, it's actually called the 51 Capital March, a nationwide protest against the stolen election is what the theme of it is.
[01:47:58.296 --> 01:48:01.538]  And it was an individual named Kip Marshall
[01:48:02.048 --> 01:48:02.408]  Thank you.
[01:48:20.726 --> 01:48:28.754]  He started it and then created a website for it and my friend Karen Renick and Abby Delosier, both of them who have been real active here locally.
[01:48:29.335 --> 01:48:32.638]  Abby's been putting on press conferences on this issue for a while.
[01:48:32.698 --> 01:48:33.299]  I've been helping her.
[01:48:34.494 --> 01:48:39.036]  We just got on the website and found this guy's name and a couple other people from Houston.
[01:48:39.056 --> 01:48:39.676]  Well, let me just say this.
[01:48:39.696 --> 01:48:40.637]  So we just teamed up with them.
[01:48:41.657 --> 01:48:47.019]  Again, they may steal these elections, but we have to stand up and say, we know what you did.
[01:48:47.619 --> 01:48:51.061]  Whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, fraud is fraud.
[01:48:51.881 --> 01:48:55.762]  And we've got to expose this, or it's over, America.
[01:48:55.822 --> 01:49:00.463]  And I want to see you out there this Sunday at the Texas State Capitol, high noon.
[01:49:00.523 --> 01:49:01.483]  I'll be giving a speech.
[01:49:01.843 --> 01:49:03.164]  Many others will be giving speeches.
[01:49:03.444 --> 01:49:09.285]  And, Vicki, that it sounds to me like what you're saying is there's other rallies going on simultaneously around the country.
[01:49:09.525 --> 01:49:10.886]  Are there websites to find that?
[01:49:11.866 --> 01:49:13.166]  It's www.51CapitalMarch, all one word.
[01:49:17.242 --> 01:49:20.465]  And you can plug into that and see what's going on in your state.
[01:49:20.505 --> 01:49:22.187]  We're trying to get 51 of them going.
[01:49:22.628 --> 01:49:24.329]  So type that in Google and you'll find it?
[01:49:25.090 --> 01:49:26.712]  Yes.
[01:49:27.012 --> 01:49:29.394]  We're really honored that you're going to be one of our speakers, Alex.
[01:49:29.454 --> 01:49:30.255]  Really appreciate it.
[01:49:30.455 --> 01:49:31.757]  Vicki, do you have a website yet?
[01:49:33.178 --> 01:49:34.359]  Um, no.
[01:49:34.579 --> 01:49:36.361]  Hey, how about, how about... Well, actually I do.
[01:49:36.441 --> 01:49:40.023]  I mean, I'm the national chairperson for the Coalition for Visible Ballots.
[01:49:40.143 --> 01:49:42.545]  No, I understand that, but we need to get you a local news site.
[01:49:42.565 --> 01:49:43.646]  We'll probably get you somebody to do that.
[01:49:43.826 --> 01:49:44.807]  Thanks for joining us, Vicki.
[01:49:45.147 --> 01:49:45.888]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:49:46.088 --> 01:49:46.548]  See you this Sunday.
[01:49:46.568 --> 01:49:47.029]  See you Sunday.
[01:49:47.309 --> 01:49:47.709]  Okay.
[01:49:47.849 --> 01:49:48.410]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:49.250 --> 01:49:49.951]  Your call's coming up.
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.323]  We're good to go.
[01:50:10.459 --> 01:50:14.704]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.764 --> 01:50:21.711]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.811 --> 01:50:23.933]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:24.174 --> 01:50:24.514]  Homeland!
[01:50:24.534 --> 01:50:29.475]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:51:15.928 --> 01:51:26.972]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:27.092 --> 01:51:35.954]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:36.214 --> 01:51:39.515]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:52:58.524 --> 01:53:00.445]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:53:00.905 --> 01:53:03.767]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:05.187 --> 01:53:08.189]  You wonder why government's getting so arrogant.
[01:53:09.169 --> 01:53:11.251]  Because they're taking your right to vote away, people.
[01:53:13.071 --> 01:53:16.673]  And the establishment will hand power back and forth between the Republicans and Democrats.
[01:53:18.194 --> 01:53:18.834]  It's amazing.
[01:53:19.655 --> 01:53:25.758]  I just hope the Democrats, when, you know, they're stealing elections, I hope they'll stand up, you know, when Republicans really win.
[01:53:27.461 --> 01:53:30.202]  But, I mean, this is what's happening.
[01:53:30.502 --> 01:53:31.402]  Let's go to your calls.
[01:53:31.422 --> 01:53:32.442]  I want to thank you for holding.
[01:53:33.242 --> 01:53:35.043]  John in Texas, then Pam in others.
[01:53:35.103 --> 01:53:35.863]  John, go ahead.
[01:53:36.603 --> 01:53:36.963]  Hi, Alex.
[01:53:37.243 --> 01:53:37.543]  Hello.
[01:53:38.324 --> 01:53:43.125]  I've seen 700 Cubs today, and they had a pretty good news segment on microchipping.
[01:53:43.845 --> 01:53:45.505]  Basically, they were saying that's a thing of the future.
[01:53:45.565 --> 01:53:46.125]  It's coming.
[01:53:47.246 --> 01:53:48.546]  Did they say it was good or bad?
[01:53:49.486 --> 01:53:50.486]  They were sort of lukewarm.
[01:53:50.546 --> 01:53:53.467]  I thought at the end of the program that Gordon Robinson,
[01:53:54.116 --> 01:53:59.900]  Robertson was condemning, but he said, well, they're probably just going to bring it on us like the driver's license and everything else.
[01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:03.703]  You don't have to have it, but life would be a lot easier if you do have it.
[01:54:06.045 --> 01:54:07.426]  They didn't call it Mark of the Beast?
[01:54:07.466 --> 01:54:07.766]  Nothing?
[01:54:07.966 --> 01:54:12.610]  No, I thought he was going to say, this is evil, don't take it, but he didn't say anything.
[01:54:12.750 --> 01:54:14.611]  Hey, I got a tape somewhere around here.
[01:54:14.632 --> 01:54:17.093]  I put it on TV once.
[01:54:17.113 --> 01:54:18.494]  I got thousands of tapes, folks.
[01:54:19.215 --> 01:54:21.717]  Pat Robertson is saying it's not the Mark of the Beast.
[01:54:22.794 --> 01:54:27.895]  I mean, folks, he wrote books saying it was the mark of the beast 10, 12 years ago.
[01:54:28.195 --> 01:54:33.376]  See, they're all shifting because they came after his TV network to take his tax exemption.
[01:54:33.956 --> 01:54:38.858]  And boy, when Clinton did that in the mid-90s, that whole operation changed.
[01:54:39.498 --> 01:54:47.880]  Yeah, he wrote a book called The New World Order, and he pretty much laid out everything that we talk about, but then all of a sudden they must have threatened him or bought him off because he jumped right into bed with them.
[01:54:47.900 --> 01:54:49.740]  Well, it isn't must have, they did.
[01:54:51.184 --> 01:54:59.546]  They came after, the guy owns like 20-something TV channels on cable, and they went after his holdings, and boy, he turned around.
[01:54:59.586 --> 01:55:01.026]  I mean, I saw the 180.
[01:55:02.487 --> 01:55:03.227]  It was instant.
[01:55:04.987 --> 01:55:08.828]  So, and Jay Sekulow and all of them, man, it's disgusting.
[01:55:09.409 --> 01:55:14.230]  Well, I think they're going to rerun that program tonight on a family channel at 10 o'clock if anybody wanted to tape record it.
[01:55:14.830 --> 01:55:19.351]  I'm going to record it because that's more ammunition in my video library to say that, hey, it exists.
[01:55:19.966 --> 01:55:20.746]  Here it is, Ray.
[01:55:20.766 --> 01:55:21.206]  This is a fan.
[01:55:21.227 --> 01:55:22.787]  This is some art club thing.
[01:55:22.807 --> 01:55:23.367]  It exists.
[01:55:23.427 --> 01:55:24.708]  I've had the CEOs on.
[01:55:25.588 --> 01:55:26.509]  Good points.
[01:55:26.529 --> 01:55:28.109]  Hope somebody tapes it and sends it to me.
[01:55:28.789 --> 01:55:29.590]  This is at 10 o'clock.
[01:55:29.630 --> 01:55:31.090]  I'll be doing another radio interview.
[01:55:31.110 --> 01:55:34.592]  They're doing video editing from 11 to 2 in the morning on a new film.
[01:55:34.652 --> 01:55:37.053]  And I'm going to get up bright and early and do another interview.
[01:55:37.093 --> 01:55:38.753]  Never stop in the fight.
[01:55:38.833 --> 01:55:39.734]  Pam in Indiana.
[01:55:39.774 --> 01:55:40.734]  Pam, thanks for holding.
[01:55:42.195 --> 01:55:42.835]  Hello, Pam.
[01:55:43.255 --> 01:55:43.395]  Thanks.
[01:55:43.415 --> 01:55:44.375]  You're doing a great job.
[01:55:45.056 --> 01:55:45.536]  Thank you.
[01:55:46.236 --> 01:55:46.996]  Okay.
[01:55:47.116 --> 01:55:48.057]  I just have a question.
[01:55:49.235 --> 01:56:00.157]  I know it's probably going to sound stupid and everything, but I don't get your radio show here, and I really can't get on the computer and everything because it keeps kicking me off, and I really don't know a lot about what's going on.
[01:56:00.618 --> 01:56:03.478]  Where are you going online to get on the stream?
[01:56:03.998 --> 01:56:04.618]  Infowars.
[01:56:05.119 --> 01:56:08.179]  You know, the problem is I found out one of our links is bad there.
[01:56:08.199 --> 01:56:11.660]  It goes to the same stream, and the stream fills up.
[01:56:12.316 --> 01:56:13.997]  In fact, I'm glad you mentioned that.
[01:56:14.878 --> 01:56:21.502]  Go to GCNlive.com and find the second stream for me, and you can find other streams there.
[01:56:22.403 --> 01:56:22.643]  Okay.
[01:56:23.103 --> 01:56:24.324]  And maybe I can listen to you there?
[01:56:24.464 --> 01:56:26.285]  Because I'm in Indiana, and I don't get your radio.
[01:56:26.305 --> 01:56:31.529]  Yeah, I need the network to call my webmaster and tell her which stream I'm on day and night.
[01:56:31.549 --> 01:56:34.271]  There's another stream, and tell us which one to link to.
[01:56:37.273 --> 01:56:39.414]  So there I am talking to the network through the airwaves.
[01:56:39.434 --> 01:56:39.794]  Go ahead.
[01:56:41.229 --> 01:56:42.269]  Okay.
[01:56:42.489 --> 01:56:43.730]  I'm just kind of curious and everything.
[01:56:43.790 --> 01:56:53.252]  I mean, I'm kind of new to, I mean, like, listening to you and hearing about all this stuff because I'm one of the ones, I suppose, that are just like, oh my gosh, I can't believe this is happening.
[01:56:53.812 --> 01:56:59.654]  But, like, we have your videos and we make copies and we give them to people and everything.
[01:56:59.674 --> 01:57:04.395]  But I'm just kind of curious on how many people there are, like, patriotic people and everything.
[01:57:04.435 --> 01:57:08.776]  I mean, you're obviously very busy and, I mean, if things are...
[01:57:09.662 --> 01:57:12.403]  If we're actually going to be able to beat this.
[01:57:13.524 --> 01:57:14.264]  I know this.
[01:57:14.384 --> 01:57:16.505]  If we weren't doing this, it'd be a lot worse.
[01:57:16.786 --> 01:57:19.527]  And yes, evil always falls.
[01:57:21.048 --> 01:57:22.568]  Will it crush us in the process?
[01:57:23.089 --> 01:57:24.389]  Well, that's going to happen either way.
[01:57:24.449 --> 01:57:26.951]  So our best chance is fighting it.
[01:57:27.011 --> 01:57:32.693]  But look, duty is mine and consequences are God's, as George Washington said.
[01:57:33.334 --> 01:57:35.875]  And so I've got a duty to fight evil, even if I'm going to lose.
[01:57:36.812 --> 01:57:38.214]  Oh, I'm not saying that we shouldn't be doing this.
[01:57:38.234 --> 01:57:38.594]  No, I know.
[01:57:38.654 --> 01:57:39.395]  I know what you're saying.
[01:57:39.415 --> 01:57:39.755]  Stay there.
[01:57:39.775 --> 01:57:40.636]  We'll talk more about it.
[01:57:43.900 --> 01:57:44.460]  Hello, folks.
[01:57:49.986 --> 01:57:50.627]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.287 --> 01:57:52.369]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.069 --> 01:57:54.170]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.811 --> 01:57:55.672]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.393 --> 01:57:57.194]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.933 --> 01:58:01.914]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.114 --> 01:58:06.235]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:10.255 --> 01:58:14.316]  Well, I said that December 7th would be a day that would live in infamy.
[01:58:14.856 --> 01:58:16.216]  December 7th, 2004.
[01:58:17.497 --> 01:58:21.257]  We've also got to say that it's the old one-two punch to the Constitution.
[01:58:21.277 --> 01:58:24.638]  December 8th is a day that will live in infamy.
[01:58:26.121 --> 01:58:33.146]  It, of course, is December 9, 2004 today, as we accelerate towards the end of 2004 into 2005.
[01:58:35.407 --> 01:58:41.191]  And before they passed it, they wouldn't admit that it was the Patriot Act II and the National ID Card.
[01:58:42.932 --> 01:58:46.255]  But last night, I turned on Fox Television, stuck a tape in.
[01:58:46.295 --> 01:58:47.576]  I said, I've got to get this on tape.
[01:58:47.596 --> 01:58:49.237]  They're not going to be able to help themselves.
[01:58:49.577 --> 01:58:51.118]  They will celebrate today.
[01:58:51.912 --> 01:58:57.273]  Another stabbing wound to the heart of America.
[01:58:57.513 --> 01:58:59.174]  And sure enough, I turned it on.
[01:58:59.694 --> 01:59:07.436]  There was a smiling neocon going, the Justice Department is beside itself getting Patriot Act II passed.
[01:59:07.616 --> 01:59:11.937]  And he just stuck his lower lip out and smiled.
[01:59:12.137 --> 01:59:14.097]  I mean, literally, I knew, too.
[01:59:14.177 --> 01:59:17.358]  I said, as soon as they pass this, they're going to have a celebration dance.
[01:59:18.498 --> 01:59:20.419]  And so I started flipping through the other channels.
[01:59:21.778 --> 01:59:24.539]  And there were celebrations going on everywhere.
[01:59:25.340 --> 01:59:27.721]  You fools, we own and run you.
[01:59:27.801 --> 01:59:29.202]  We're going to dominate you.
[01:59:30.002 --> 01:59:31.243]  You're our slaves.
[01:59:31.263 --> 01:59:35.485]  I mean, they didn't come right out and say that, but they... We got our Patriot Act, too.
[01:59:35.545 --> 01:59:37.726]  There was a provision about ID cards.
[01:59:38.526 --> 01:59:40.127]  And, of course, then they'd add a lie to it.
[01:59:40.427 --> 01:59:42.788]  We've beefed up Border Patrol with this new bill.
[01:59:42.868 --> 01:59:43.589]  That's not true.
[01:59:45.009 --> 01:59:46.810]  There are thousands less Border Patrol.
[01:59:47.471 --> 01:59:47.931]  Thousands.
[01:59:48.972 --> 01:59:52.134]  2,000 less in the Texas sector alone.
[01:59:52.615 --> 01:59:54.356]  Now, that's in the major Texas papers.
[01:59:54.796 --> 01:59:56.117]  It's never in the national papers.
[01:59:57.759 --> 02:00:01.701]  I mean, yeah, thousands quit to go be air marshals, and then they hire 1,000 more.
[02:00:01.761 --> 02:00:05.124]  Well, you've lost 1,000 in one sector alone.
[02:00:05.164 --> 02:00:06.685]  But at first, it was 2,000 that quit.
[02:00:10.168 --> 02:00:12.569]  So they just say, we've got Border Patrol!
[02:00:13.010 --> 02:00:14.771]  People go, oh, mostly conservative!
[02:00:15.316 --> 02:00:17.197]  And they mix that in with Patriot Act, too.
[02:00:17.857 --> 02:00:19.277]  Well, a national ID card.
[02:00:20.798 --> 02:00:24.259]  I'm getting calls and emails that now they're all over TV.
[02:00:24.780 --> 02:00:26.360]  And if you've seen this, you're welcome to call in.
[02:00:28.161 --> 02:00:31.462]  Crowing, just up there like a rooster.
[02:00:31.522 --> 02:00:34.743]  Cock-a-doodle-doo, we're enslaving you.
[02:00:35.503 --> 02:00:39.145]  They're just all over the place going, well, there was some provisions you might not have known about.
[02:00:39.165 --> 02:00:42.246]  A few weeks ago when they passed forced psychological testing...
[02:00:44.406 --> 02:00:46.407]  They also tagged on to some of those bills.
[02:00:47.567 --> 02:00:51.649]  Any group of senators being able to look at your income tax returns and have enemies list.
[02:00:52.089 --> 02:00:53.970]  Stuff Nixon almost went to jail for.
[02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:58.232]  But yeah, now it's just out in the open, legalized.
[02:00:58.652 --> 02:01:04.935]  And also to have the IRS come after you with repo men.
[02:01:06.276 --> 02:01:09.777]  So you thought it was bad before with the IRS, now it's going to be repo men.
[02:01:10.118 --> 02:01:13.139]  No judge, no jury, just repo men.
[02:01:14.384 --> 02:01:17.325]  It's going to be funny when the cops and people start getting their stuff taken.
[02:01:17.345 --> 02:01:19.346]  Because, you know, they love enforcing the system.
[02:01:19.846 --> 02:01:23.467]  And they're going to have repo men dragging off their cars and stuff.
[02:01:25.248 --> 02:01:27.569]  You get to have some of what you've helped set up.
[02:01:29.029 --> 02:01:29.529]  I'm sorry.
[02:01:29.569 --> 02:01:35.972]  It's just, you know, the police will go with the IRS to take somebody's house and throw them out on the street without even a court order.
[02:01:37.352 --> 02:01:38.913]  But they never do it to their fellow officers.
[02:01:39.633 --> 02:01:42.414]  But it won't matter because they're going to turn the repo men loose on you.
[02:01:44.042 --> 02:01:45.282]  Something against the repo, man.
[02:01:45.362 --> 02:01:47.423]  I have something against the IRS, though.
[02:01:49.804 --> 02:02:05.229]  By the way, Congressman Ron Paul is coming up later, and we'll talk about our wondrous new freedoms, and the wondrous new dollar value that we have, and the wondrous national toll roads that now Time Magazine admits they're putting in.
[02:02:06.954 --> 02:02:08.695]  Oh yeah, it's all just going public now.
[02:02:09.155 --> 02:02:11.297]  Oh, it's an afterhighway, it's going to be a tax.
[02:02:11.737 --> 02:02:12.878]  We knew that six, seven years ago.
[02:02:12.898 --> 02:02:14.258]  You've heard us talk about it ad nauseum.
[02:02:14.619 --> 02:02:15.619]  Now it's mainstream news.
[02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:17.661]  It's all coming up.
[02:02:18.061 --> 02:02:21.183]  The website is infowars.com.
[02:02:21.703 --> 02:02:23.544]  That's infowars.com.
[02:02:24.885 --> 02:02:31.449]  And of course, there is also infowars.net.
[02:02:32.369 --> 02:02:34.731]  We're having those sites updated for you right now.
[02:02:35.413 --> 02:02:41.559]  PrisonPlanet.com isn't updated today with all the big news because Paul went to a football game last night and I guess he's still sleeping.
[02:02:41.919 --> 02:02:42.519]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:45.482 --> 02:02:49.826]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.006 --> 02:02:54.410]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.570 --> 02:02:58.954]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:58.994 --> 02:03:00.336]  The New World Order.
[02:03:02.117 --> 02:03:06.340]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:13.324]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.464 --> 02:03:15.506]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:15.826 --> 02:03:26.293]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.473 --> 02:03:30.156]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video,
[02:03:30.776 --> 02:03:32.458]  888-253-3139 Order today and spread the word.
[02:03:46.576 --> 02:03:47.617]  The war on terrorism.
[02:03:47.938 --> 02:03:50.741]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.001 --> 02:03:55.166]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:55.586 --> 02:03:56.407]  So what do you do?
[02:03:56.728 --> 02:04:01.313]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:01.793 --> 02:04:03.914]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:04.395 --> 02:04:19.104]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:19.144 --> 02:04:26.208]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:04:26.548 --> 02:04:30.970]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[02:04:31.390 --> 02:04:33.171]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:33.191 --> 02:04:33.391]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:44.545 --> 02:04:50.827]  Maca is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[02:04:51.207 --> 02:04:55.328]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[02:04:55.809 --> 02:05:03.011]  Only recently has science discovered that maca is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[02:05:03.571 --> 02:05:10.917]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels.
[02:05:11.257 --> 02:05:13.519]  Increased libido, which helps prevent impotence.
[02:05:13.819 --> 02:05:17.081]  Relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort.
[02:05:17.502 --> 02:05:20.644]  Helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and night sweats.
[02:05:20.944 --> 02:05:23.926]  It also helps prevent osteoporosis and joint pain.
[02:05:24.367 --> 02:05:32.453]  Get your maca from Cliff Scott Enterprises at a price and quality that few can match because we get our maca fresh from the growers in Peru.
[02:05:32.933 --> 02:05:35.875]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:35.895 --> 02:05:37.396]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:57.777 --> 02:06:04.600]  Again, all of my websites, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, they're all being updated right now.
[02:06:05.441 --> 02:06:07.582]  Paul Watson has now woken up over in England.
[02:06:07.642 --> 02:06:11.184]  He's updating Prison Planet, and Infowars is being updated over here.
[02:06:13.905 --> 02:06:18.967]  You know, I'm really upset, but at the same time, I know that we're going to be able to fight this at the local level.
[02:06:19.027 --> 02:06:22.209]  We'll try to repeal this in the next session of Congress.
[02:06:23.365 --> 02:06:31.173]  And they wouldn't talk about it in the mainstream media until after they'd passed it, and then they were all over TV crowing about it last night.
[02:06:31.253 --> 02:06:35.137]  Oh, Patriot Act II, provisions the Justice Department wanted passed.
[02:06:35.177 --> 02:06:38.741]  And they're celebrating, Fox News said, over at the Justice Department.
[02:06:40.402 --> 02:06:43.045]  The National ID card provisions are the state level.
[02:06:43.085 --> 02:06:46.629]  Here's CNN, Senate okays intelligence overhaul bill.
[02:06:47.333 --> 02:07:00.442]  The Senate approved an intelligence reorganization bill Wednesday, ending months-long debate in Congress over how to enact changes proposed by the independent commission appointed by Bush that investigated the September 11, 2001 attacks.
[02:07:03.886 --> 02:07:09.608]  And we're joined by Congressman Ron Paul, who valiantly fought against this.
[02:07:09.668 --> 02:07:13.369]  It was 300 to something to 75.
[02:07:13.569 --> 02:07:16.510]  Most of the people who voted against it were Republicans.
[02:07:16.690 --> 02:07:19.752]  These Democrats are emailing me going, look at the evil Republicans.
[02:07:19.772 --> 02:07:20.992]  Well, look at your own Democrats.
[02:07:21.432 --> 02:07:34.803]  This is the problem, is that you've got this elitist, tyrannical agenda in Washington that's bipartisan, and then it's true, what I'd call independents like Ron Paul, who happens to be a Republican, who are fighting this.
[02:07:34.863 --> 02:07:36.324]  Congressman, thank you for joining us.
[02:07:36.564 --> 02:07:37.945]  I know it's been a tough week for you.
[02:07:37.985 --> 02:07:38.625]  Good to have you on.
[02:07:38.806 --> 02:07:39.166]  Thank you.
[02:07:39.206 --> 02:07:39.786]  Good to be with you.
[02:07:41.248 --> 02:07:44.430]  We've had New Freedom Initiative pass a few weeks ago, now this.
[02:07:45.331 --> 02:07:47.332]  No one had a chance to read it as usual.
[02:07:47.392 --> 02:07:48.273]  Can you tell us about it?
[02:07:49.170 --> 02:07:51.711]  Well, it actually didn't get discussed very much.
[02:07:51.751 --> 02:07:58.554]  You know, they talked a little bit about the chain of command and who controlled some of the intelligence to the military, and that was a big issue.
[02:07:59.134 --> 02:08:05.597]  And they did talk somewhat about the licenses going to illegal aliens, and that was not changed.
[02:08:05.637 --> 02:08:09.699]  That's stuck in the bills, so they will give licenses to illegal aliens.
[02:08:10.219 --> 02:08:11.640]  But they didn't talk a whole lot...
[02:08:12.353 --> 02:08:17.998]  About the national ID card, although it was moved along, it was further strengthened.
[02:08:18.039 --> 02:08:24.184]  They've had some standardized requirements by the federal government now in all our driver's licenses.
[02:08:24.665 --> 02:08:31.051]  But there's a reason for this, and that is that the conservative side is mixed on this because...
[02:08:31.619 --> 02:08:43.187]  Some of the anti-immigrant conservatives would do anything, even accept a national ID card for all of us, therefore punish all of us in order to take care of illegal aliens.
[02:08:43.808 --> 02:08:49.031]  And they're not exactly as opposed to the national ID card.
[02:08:49.511 --> 02:08:50.512]  I think we should be.
[02:08:50.772 --> 02:08:56.616]  I think we can still deal with illegal immigration without further undermining our personal liberties.
[02:08:56.636 --> 02:08:57.337]  It's sort of the...
[02:08:57.862 --> 02:08:59.565]  Well, in this subsection of the bill, $3,300...
[02:09:11.542 --> 02:09:13.243]  Plus pages long.
[02:09:14.103 --> 02:09:21.587]  You have the internal passport, the internal checkpoints, basically taking what the TSA does in the airports and I guess expanding that out.
[02:09:22.408 --> 02:09:27.050]  And a lot of conservatives are going, well, wait a minute, but you're going to give IDs to the illegal aliens.
[02:09:27.510 --> 02:09:29.351]  They can get a consular matricula.
[02:09:29.951 --> 02:09:34.374]  Anybody can get one of these and then go get an ID and basically have fake identities.
[02:09:34.474 --> 02:09:38.836]  So the border's more wide open than ever, and this makes it...
[02:09:40.314 --> 02:09:43.715]  And more of an open door for, quote, terrorists to come across.
[02:09:44.415 --> 02:09:49.597]  But they're going to have a magnifying glass over our lives.
[02:09:50.337 --> 02:09:53.878]  And we're making it easier for them to blend in.
[02:09:54.158 --> 02:09:56.479]  You know, we're serving their purpose.
[02:09:56.539 --> 02:10:02.140]  So I don't know how the people can accept this, you know, if they know what's really in here.
[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:06.021]  And yet the momentum decides what happens in Washington.
[02:10:06.081 --> 02:10:08.182]  Once the momentum was changed, oh, it's going to pass.
[02:10:08.675 --> 02:10:09.556]  Everybody gets scared.
[02:10:09.676 --> 02:10:18.706]  Oh, if I vote against this, it sounds like I'm a weakling on intelligence and CIA and all this stuff.
[02:10:18.746 --> 02:10:22.410]  So 75 is a terrible number to be in opposition to this.
[02:10:22.450 --> 02:10:23.511]  We should have had a lot more.
[02:10:23.952 --> 02:10:27.476]  But this was a major event and it will get worse as time goes on.
[02:10:27.496 --> 02:10:29.017]  They don't do it all at one time.
[02:10:30.539 --> 02:10:37.604]  In 1996, when they required that every state at least gather social security numbers, although they might not appear on our driver's licenses.
[02:10:37.904 --> 02:10:43.728]  So it's been going on since 1996, and this is moving along much further.
[02:10:44.349 --> 02:10:52.394]  They're going to tie in these requirements with birth certificates and social security numbers and biometrics.
[02:10:52.474 --> 02:10:57.197]  And the other big thing on this bill, it set up a national database.
[02:10:57.237 --> 02:10:57.438]  So...
[02:10:59.228 --> 02:11:03.111]  It's moving along rather quickly, and it should frighten a lot of people.
[02:11:03.551 --> 02:11:13.739]  Congressman, so we can try to navigate this bill, and I've gone to the Library of Congress website and found summaries of the 3,000 pages.
[02:11:14.379 --> 02:11:23.006]  I've had trouble finding the whole thing, but you put out a legislative alert at 2.30 Eastern a couple days ago when the House passed it,
[02:11:24.145 --> 02:11:25.586]  Well, that was back on Tuesday.
[02:11:26.047 --> 02:11:31.350]  And you said, as of 2.30, we still haven't gotten the full bill.
[02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:35.493]  And later you put out an alert saying it was over 3,000 pages.
[02:11:35.513 --> 02:11:38.776]  So obviously you don't even know at this time everything that was in it.
[02:11:38.796 --> 02:11:44.179]  You did find some of the subsections that had been in there a few weeks ago for the National ID card and the Patriot Act.
[02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:46.081]  This bill didn't have 3,000.
[02:11:46.121 --> 02:11:51.204]  The one that had the 3,000 was the omnibus bill, which came up at the last minute.
[02:11:51.244 --> 02:11:53.446]  This bill was smaller.
[02:11:54.088 --> 02:11:56.989]  But still, very, very large, and we did not have it.
[02:11:57.029 --> 02:12:01.790]  I mean, within hours, you know, you don't have it.
[02:12:01.830 --> 02:12:12.113]  They never print out a copy, and so you never see the final version unless you get on the Internet at the very end and you do your very best to go through it.
[02:12:12.233 --> 02:12:13.353]  Shouldn't that be illegal?
[02:12:13.553 --> 02:12:17.534]  I mean, how about passing a law that they have to read the bills?
[02:12:18.015 --> 02:12:18.795]  That would be something.
[02:12:18.855 --> 02:12:23.236]  I introduced that bill along that line one time, but it didn't get very far.
[02:12:24.105 --> 02:12:27.466]  It is a crime.
[02:12:27.506 --> 02:12:28.787]  The process is a crime.
[02:12:29.407 --> 02:12:37.650]  What they do is a crime, but I think the process occurs because they're doing something that's criminal and they don't want you to know about it.
[02:12:37.670 --> 02:12:39.731]  They don't want you to have time to study this.
[02:12:40.832 --> 02:12:42.592]  Why didn't we take another month or two?
[02:12:43.213 --> 02:12:46.794]  It's so naive to say, if we had not passed that
[02:12:47.165 --> 02:12:52.149]  You know, two days ago, that all of a sudden we would have been in greater danger.
[02:12:52.429 --> 02:12:54.190]  Well, Congressman, let me understand this.
[02:12:54.951 --> 02:12:56.712]  Our freedoms are in greater danger today.
[02:12:56.732 --> 02:12:57.472]  They are.
[02:12:57.492 --> 02:12:58.313]  I'm sorry for interrupting.
[02:12:58.953 --> 02:13:03.477]  Just to be clear, Fox News said that Patriot Act II did pass last night.
[02:13:04.077 --> 02:13:06.018]  Now, I'm trying to be clear on this.
[02:13:06.419 --> 02:13:08.720]  Did it pass, or did subsections of it pass?
[02:13:09.181 --> 02:13:12.903]  No, the whole thing passed, and we voted on it the day before yesterday.
[02:13:12.923 --> 02:13:13.964]  The Senate voted on it yesterday.
[02:13:14.918 --> 02:13:15.178]  Yes.
[02:13:15.539 --> 02:13:17.320]  And President will probably sign it tomorrow.
[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:20.402]  So Fox was accurate when they were very pleased about it.
[02:13:20.442 --> 02:13:31.251]  They said that the Justice Department was, quote, celebrating and very exciting that the Patriot Act II had passed the Senate yesterday and was going to the President two days ago in the House.
[02:13:31.291 --> 02:13:32.052]  So that did happen.
[02:13:34.133 --> 02:13:37.116]  I'm talking about, are you referring to the Intelligence Bill, right?
[02:13:37.376 --> 02:13:40.719]  Yes, but the Patriot Act II had been tagged onto it.
[02:13:40.739 --> 02:13:42.360]  Oh, yeah, a lot of those features are in there, right?
[02:13:45.126 --> 02:13:45.586]  Oh boy.
[02:13:48.047 --> 02:13:52.428]  So now are we going to try to repeal those sections in the next Congress?
[02:13:52.468 --> 02:13:54.068]  I know you tried that earlier this year.
[02:13:54.288 --> 02:14:07.671]  Well, you know, you can always make the effort and introduce it and let people have a little bit of hope, but when these things get passed, it's a monumental task to reverse it.
[02:14:08.211 --> 02:14:08.791]  You know, it's...
[02:14:10.591 --> 02:14:14.312]  It's just almost impossible.
[02:14:14.732 --> 02:14:28.877]  That doesn't mean you shouldn't try, and on occasion you do have a victory, but the odds of us reversing this trend... I mean, we have so many things going against us, whether it was the original Patriot Act or whether it's this one or not.
[02:14:28.897 --> 02:14:32.838]  And then the President got his mandate.
[02:14:33.438 --> 02:14:38.220]  I couldn't believe what kind of rallies we've had against the Patriot Act, and yet...
[02:14:39.082 --> 02:14:47.168]  I was dumbfounded when I saw the President campaigning on it and going after Kerry for being weak on the Patriot Act.
[02:14:47.188 --> 02:14:52.292]  I thought the American people don't like the Patriot Act, but they were able to use it to their benefit.
[02:14:52.768 --> 02:14:55.349]  He thinks he has a mandate for this type of activity.
[02:14:55.369 --> 02:14:57.050]  I'm not quite sure that's the case.
[02:14:57.290 --> 02:14:59.231]  At least he believes it, and that's the way he's acting.
[02:14:59.491 --> 02:15:04.674]  Yeah, he says it's a mandate when 80-plus percent of Americans in polls are against open borders.
[02:15:04.714 --> 02:15:06.375]  He says he has a mandate for amnesty.
[02:15:07.235 --> 02:15:10.357]  In major polls, everybody, Republican, Democrat, is against the Patriot Act.
[02:15:10.397 --> 02:15:13.778]  Four hundred cities, four states, have thrown out the Patriot Act.
[02:15:15.599 --> 02:15:18.061]  They passed the last one in the dead of night, as you documented.
[02:15:18.682 --> 02:15:22.705]  Now they're doing this yet again, and we have the new Freedom Initiative.
[02:15:23.165 --> 02:15:27.969]  How do you call any of this a conservative agenda?
[02:15:28.189 --> 02:15:35.255]  I can't, and I think it goes to show that this discrepancy probably reflects the ability of the propagandists to
[02:15:35.768 --> 02:15:44.151]  You know, take a negative poll and what the people really want and turn around and say, hey, look, the American people want this and actually go on to victory.
[02:15:44.491 --> 02:15:53.475]  But, you know, I think the trick in the election was that people did have a reason to vote for Bush over Kerry and it had to do with moral values and probably marriage.
[02:15:53.955 --> 02:15:59.817]  But Bush then was able to take this and say, well, this is a mandate for us to
[02:16:00.552 --> 02:16:04.316]  Do more Patriot Act type legislation and more war overseas.
[02:16:04.897 --> 02:16:09.683]  And I would say, I would point people to your neocon speech over a year ago where you talk about the betrayal.
[02:16:10.493 --> 02:16:12.634]  I think we're good to go.
[02:16:12.654 --> 02:16:13.975]  I think we're good to go.
[02:16:35.587 --> 02:16:42.430]  And why not take back states at a state-by-state basis level and go back to the Tenth Amendment?
[02:16:42.470 --> 02:16:44.811]  Couldn't you do more as governor or lieutenant governor?
[02:16:46.071 --> 02:16:48.732]  Well, you'd really be bucking a trend.
[02:16:48.792 --> 02:16:52.834]  I mean, they'd claim the Civil War has already been fought.
[02:16:53.854 --> 02:16:57.075]  You would cream Rick Perry, Mr. Toll Road.
[02:16:58.056 --> 02:16:58.336]  Well...
[02:16:59.275 --> 02:16:59.755]  I don't know.
[02:16:59.795 --> 02:17:06.981]  They have money talks, and they're very powerful, and they would have many, many millions of dollars.
[02:17:07.041 --> 02:17:12.425]  You are wildly popular in this state, and you know you could win if there was an election fraud.
[02:17:13.005 --> 02:17:16.068]  Well, I'll check with Senator Hutchinson and see if she'll support me.
[02:17:18.329 --> 02:17:19.190]  Well, you know what?
[02:17:19.650 --> 02:17:22.673]  Look, you know, what are your approval ratings in this state?
[02:17:22.693 --> 02:17:22.853]  Like, 65%?
[02:17:25.255 --> 02:17:25.876]  I don't know.
[02:17:26.616 --> 02:17:29.858]  I know my district is okay, but I've not done any through the state.
[02:17:30.518 --> 02:17:32.119]  Well, Congressman, please stay with us.
[02:17:32.439 --> 02:17:37.622]  And I think we may need to switch strategies and have people like yourself become governors.
[02:17:38.703 --> 02:17:40.443]  But, again, that's my humble opinion.
[02:17:40.984 --> 02:17:42.665]  We'll be right back with Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:17:42.685 --> 02:17:43.065]  Stay with us.
[02:17:46.656 --> 02:17:51.220]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glass, who is a pharmacist from Mark's Plaza Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[02:17:51.340 --> 02:17:52.562]  Hi, Alan, welcome to the program.
[02:17:52.762 --> 02:17:53.322]  Thank you, Marvin.
[02:17:53.503 --> 02:17:56.866]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[02:17:57.046 --> 02:17:57.566]  Is that true?
[02:17:57.787 --> 02:17:58.788]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[02:17:58.808 --> 02:18:01.790]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[02:18:01.850 --> 02:18:02.131]  price.
[02:18:02.311 --> 02:18:04.393]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[02:18:04.413 --> 02:18:05.174]  They're very common.
[02:18:05.254 --> 02:18:08.457]  Those common drugs you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[02:18:08.477 --> 02:18:08.697]  price.
[02:18:08.997 --> 02:18:10.158]  Now, what about Tamoxifen?
[02:18:10.198 --> 02:18:12.580]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:16.603]  Tamoxifen, you can see a 75% savings against the regular U.S.
[02:18:16.623 --> 02:18:16.903]  price.
[02:18:17.284 --> 02:18:19.645]  Now, are these brand-name products made by the same companies?
[02:18:19.926 --> 02:18:21.947]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[02:18:21.987 --> 02:18:24.009]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.
[02:18:24.269 --> 02:18:29.170]  So to save money on prescription drugs in Canada, call the toll-free number for your information package.

[02:18:45.703 --> 02:18:47.285]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.

[02:19:36.897 --> 02:19:37.858]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:19:46.044 --> 02:19:47.504]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[02:19:47.804 --> 02:19:52.386]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[02:19:52.706 --> 02:19:55.066]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[02:19:55.286 --> 02:19:56.827]  Achieve financial independence.
[02:19:57.207 --> 02:20:02.288]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[02:20:02.588 --> 02:20:03.828]  Get the Red Book of the U.S.
[02:20:03.868 --> 02:20:06.569]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[02:20:06.969 --> 02:20:13.693]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book, along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.

[02:20:38.070 --> 02:20:39.031]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:40.972 --> 02:20:44.075]  Get your red book now and you'll weather any storm that comes your way.
[02:20:45.367 --> 02:20:48.390]  You and your family members getting enough minerals on the daily diet?
[02:20:48.770 --> 02:20:51.272]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[02:20:51.512 --> 02:20:58.579]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[02:20:58.779 --> 02:21:02.062]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[02:21:02.322 --> 02:21:04.344]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[02:21:04.684 --> 02:21:12.511]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[02:21:12.751 --> 02:21:13.351]  We're good to go.
[02:21:43.792 --> 02:21:47.977]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:21:48.537 --> 02:21:51.420]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:53.162 --> 02:21:54.303]  All right, be clear.
[02:21:54.343 --> 02:21:56.125]  I talked to the congressman during the break.
[02:21:57.547 --> 02:21:59.789]  Sections of Patriot Act 2 passed.
[02:22:00.575 --> 02:22:04.280]  In the intelligence bill, the 9-11 bill, but the entire thing didn't.
[02:22:04.320 --> 02:22:08.725]  So they're passing it piecemeal is what they're doing.
[02:22:08.745 --> 02:22:12.689]  The national ID card provision did indeed pass.
[02:22:13.310 --> 02:22:15.252]  And we're talking to Congressman Ron Paul right now.
[02:22:15.293 --> 02:22:17.195]  I just have to commend you, Congressman, and your staff.
[02:22:18.095 --> 02:22:36.344]  I mean, when other people's congressmen won't even return calls, your folks were calling the alternative media telling them to fight the bill a couple days ago, and your staff is still there fighting and was still there yesterday fighting this stuff in the Senate when others were already leaving and going back to their districts.
[02:22:36.364 --> 02:22:37.825]  So I can only commend you, Congressman.
[02:22:38.265 --> 02:22:44.128]  Finishing up, though, concerning you running for governor of the state of Texas, is that something you could win?
[02:22:45.569 --> 02:22:47.690]  Well, it would be tough.
[02:22:48.468 --> 02:23:05.396]  I believe that the views that we hold and your listeners hold are popular enough that we could win if we had enough exposure, which means if you don't have sympathetic media, you have to have enough money to buy the advertisements and get the message out.
[02:23:05.776 --> 02:23:13.040]  But I really do believe that people are in great numbers, are in the majority, want to be left alone.
[02:23:13.496 --> 02:23:20.299]  They like the free market and they like to be left alone and they'd like to see us to be doing a lot less overseas.
[02:23:20.339 --> 02:23:34.945]  I think these particular views and putting them at a state level that just keep the government small and they keep the taxes low, yes, I think that those views are winnable and a person could win on a platform like that.
[02:23:36.563 --> 02:23:43.208]  I just want to spend a little bit more time on the Patriot Act and on the National ID Card provisions in this bill.
[02:23:43.788 --> 02:23:54.495]  If it makes it easier for illegal aliens and terrorists, which the bill clearly does, other Congress would have been saying this, then how can they say, we did this to keep you safe, we had to rush and do this to keep you safe?
[02:23:54.715 --> 02:23:55.876]  I mean, this is a sick joke.
[02:23:57.337 --> 02:23:58.177]  Yeah, it is.
[02:23:59.618 --> 02:24:05.582]  At one point, they believe in at least more open borders, and they believe that they shouldn't offend...
[02:24:06.212 --> 02:24:25.569]  Anybody who's Hispanic, and because that's a political correct thing to do, and they're treading between these two issues, and then they have this pretense that they're going to do everything to make us safe and secure and giving this more power to the CIA and have a super agency and spend, you know, I think that bill had $14 billion in it.
[02:24:25.929 --> 02:24:28.731]  It's a huge, it's a bigger bureaucracy than ever.
[02:24:28.751 --> 02:24:28.952]  Now, 14.4.
[02:24:28.992 --> 02:24:30.873]  So, in one sense, they're claiming...
[02:24:33.140 --> 02:24:45.584]  You know, that their whole effort is to make us safe and secure at the same time they ignore the very things that they should be doing, and that is finding out who's coming into our country and who are the potential terrorists.
[02:24:45.984 --> 02:24:47.345]  We've got about three minutes left.
[02:24:47.365 --> 02:24:52.206]  Can you talk about the economy and gold and the plunging dollar a year and a half ago?
[02:24:52.246 --> 02:24:55.727]  You gave a speech here in Central Texas and predicted depression.
[02:24:56.328 --> 02:24:57.568]  Can you tell us what you see happening?
[02:24:58.280 --> 02:25:01.822]  Well I still think that the economy is going to continue to weaken.
[02:25:02.162 --> 02:25:07.444]  I think in the last two days you saw an example of what happens when you have unsound money.
[02:25:07.464 --> 02:25:13.667]  Yes, we can predict long term that the dollar will weaken and go down and the economy will weaken and prices will go up.
[02:25:14.167 --> 02:25:15.768]  Eventually interest rates will go up.
[02:25:16.248 --> 02:25:18.369]  But in the last two days you saw sudden shifts.
[02:25:18.908 --> 02:25:23.350]  Which can be also very, very harmful to the marketplace.
[02:25:23.450 --> 02:25:32.335]  This is such a difference to what happens if you have a sound currency throughout the world and everybody has a gold-backed currency.
[02:25:32.375 --> 02:25:33.616]  You have stable currency.
[02:25:33.636 --> 02:25:35.437]  We're seeing wild gyrations.
[02:25:35.697 --> 02:25:36.317]  That's it.
[02:25:36.357 --> 02:25:37.478]  Wild gyrations.
[02:25:38.518 --> 02:25:39.879]  It's fluctuating all the time.
[02:25:40.159 --> 02:25:47.823]  To me, it's something like if you and I were building a building and we were an architect and I was the contractor and we had a measuring stick...
[02:25:48.750 --> 02:25:51.814]  Like the yard or the foot, and it kept changing every day.
[02:25:51.834 --> 02:25:53.236]  What kind of a building would we have?
[02:25:53.536 --> 02:25:59.683]  The measuring rod of economic value is the currency, and it's very unsound.
[02:25:59.763 --> 02:26:01.806]  Why, bottom line, is the dollar eroding?
[02:26:02.406 --> 02:26:03.648]  Because we print too many.
[02:26:04.360 --> 02:26:05.141]  I think we're good to go.
[02:26:20.620 --> 02:26:22.580]  And the Fed accommodates and prints the money.
[02:26:22.921 --> 02:26:26.041]  When you print money, the value of that money has to go down.
[02:26:26.461 --> 02:26:30.682]  It just doesn't go down evenly or steadily and it doesn't affect everybody equally.
[02:26:31.163 --> 02:26:33.683]  But ultimately, it loses value.
[02:26:33.703 --> 02:26:38.064]  History shows that under these conditions, gold always goes up.
[02:26:38.484 --> 02:26:40.405]  Not straight up, but eventually goes up.
[02:26:40.825 --> 02:26:43.966]  Not too long ago in our history, our dollar was worth $20 an ounce.
[02:26:45.876 --> 02:26:47.497]  Now it's $440 an ounce.
[02:26:47.517 --> 02:26:50.818]  So that is the trend, and it will go a lot higher.
[02:26:50.938 --> 02:26:53.678]  There is inflation, regardless of what they say.
[02:26:54.459 --> 02:27:00.721]  Congressman, they're now even pushing new anti-terror legislation on the heels of this one.
[02:27:01.661 --> 02:27:04.062]  Is there any end in sight to this black hole of tyranny?
[02:27:05.222 --> 02:27:14.245]  I don't see it, not under today's circumstances, unless the American people decide that they want their freedom more than they want their security right now.
[02:27:14.761 --> 02:27:26.771]  The message that the people in Congress get is people want to be safe and secure, both economically and physically, and that's what promotes the welfare state, and that's what promotes this anti-terrorist sentiment.
[02:27:27.872 --> 02:27:29.733]  I think it's going to end when we run out of money.
[02:27:30.114 --> 02:27:32.616]  Congressman, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[02:27:32.656 --> 02:27:33.276]  Have a good Christmas.
[02:27:35.958 --> 02:27:36.899]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.339 --> 02:27:38.981]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.001 --> 02:27:42.564]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.661 --> 02:27:48.142]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[02:27:48.342 --> 02:27:55.685]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[02:27:56.005 --> 02:28:00.427]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:28:00.687 --> 02:28:10.511]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[02:28:11.272 --> 02:28:14.936]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[02:28:15.276 --> 02:28:17.759]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[02:28:18.079 --> 02:28:24.006]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[02:28:24.246 --> 02:28:25.808]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[02:28:26.048 --> 02:28:26.929]  Friends, don't wait.
[02:28:27.030 --> 02:28:30.014]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[02:28:30.174 --> 02:28:31.095]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[02:28:31.115 --> 02:28:31.315]  That's 800-255-1912.

[02:28:35.301 --> 02:28:36.042]  It's powerful stuff.

[02:28:59.091 --> 02:29:03.776]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:29:04.236 --> 02:29:10.960]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:29:11.341 --> 02:29:23.108]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:29:23.608 --> 02:29:28.070]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:29:45.586 --> 02:29:48.947]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[02:29:49.207 --> 02:29:49.527]  Why?
[02:29:49.547 --> 02:29:52.488]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of Cardivite?

[02:31:17.280 --> 02:31:19.141]  We're going to have wide open telephones.
[02:31:19.161 --> 02:31:22.644]  We're about to go to Ron and Tim and Rosemary and John and many others.
[02:31:22.684 --> 02:31:25.926]  Toll free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:26.186 --> 02:31:41.216]  Imagine, my friends, Congress, an hour before they pass it, issuing the bill, sections of Patriot Act II, the National ID card, all of it being passed.
[02:31:42.157 --> 02:31:45.059]  Passing the House two days ago, passing the Senate yesterday.
[02:31:46.101 --> 02:31:49.865]  And then Fox News crowing about Patriot Act II and how wonderful this is.
[02:31:51.747 --> 02:31:54.270]  Makes me very, very angry, to put it lightly.
[02:31:55.552 --> 02:32:07.485]  Before we go to your calls, if you want to fight back against this New World Order, you heard Ron Paul, and he's talked about this in the past, almost everybody he talks to is against the New World Order, is woken up to what's happening, knows that we have globalists running the government.
[02:32:08.982 --> 02:32:11.223]  But the establishment doesn't care what the people want.
[02:32:11.243 --> 02:32:12.904]  They just keep moving forward with their tyranny.
[02:32:13.044 --> 02:32:14.985]  But we have the moral advantage.
[02:32:15.065 --> 02:32:16.566]  We have the majority view.
[02:32:18.567 --> 02:32:22.790]  And it's time to reach out to people who know something's wrong but just can't put their finger directly on it.
[02:32:23.150 --> 02:32:25.211]  And you can do that with my documentary films.
[02:32:25.411 --> 02:32:26.932]  I have made 11 of them.
[02:32:28.393 --> 02:32:30.574]  The 11th film is American Dictators.
[02:32:31.525 --> 02:32:41.970]  Documenting the staged election of 2004, showing how Bush and Carrier, Cousins, Skull and Bones, we get into Bohemian Grove, the Patriot Acts, Homeland Security, the latest 9-11 information.
[02:32:43.011 --> 02:32:45.192]  It's a riveting film.
[02:32:45.392 --> 02:32:47.593]  It's 115 minutes long on DVD, 95 minutes long on VHS.
[02:32:47.613 --> 02:32:49.114]  $19.95 for one copy, each additional copy, $5.95.
[02:32:49.174 --> 02:32:50.835]  You can buy one copy and then buy...
[02:32:59.642 --> 02:33:02.565]  Three or four, I don't know, ten copies to give as gifts.
[02:33:04.127 --> 02:33:11.475]  This way you can give somebody an original with a nice shrink wrap and the color cover and the hard case and the color stamp inlay on top of the DVD.
[02:33:11.495 --> 02:33:13.998]  It's a great gift to give.
[02:33:14.058 --> 02:33:16.601]  Or buy one copy and make copies and give people copies.
[02:33:17.141 --> 02:33:17.902]  I mean, I don't care.
[02:33:17.942 --> 02:33:19.644]  They just might like an original a little bit better.
[02:33:21.304 --> 02:33:25.689]  $5.95, you're not going to find political documentaries any cheaper than that.
[02:33:25.969 --> 02:33:30.294]  We're doing this to get the word out, and that sale only goes for about another week.
[02:33:31.516 --> 02:33:33.277]  And we'll ship it out to your UPS ground.
[02:33:33.618 --> 02:33:36.281]  You'll get it about four or five days after you order it from us.
[02:33:37.869 --> 02:33:39.650]  So please take advantage of this.
[02:33:39.670 --> 02:33:50.594]  We have a 9-11 special, four 9-11 videos, my two films, two other great films, and Paul Watson's excellent Order Out of Chaos, 300-plus page book, for $59.95.
[02:33:52.275 --> 02:33:58.577]  Even if you already own some of those, you can get them and keep the ones you don't have and give the others you already have as a gift.
[02:33:59.838 --> 02:34:01.278]  So get four videos and a book, $59.95.
[02:34:03.934 --> 02:34:05.575]  Please take advantage of this.
[02:34:05.815 --> 02:34:07.275]  We have a bunch of other specials.
[02:34:07.315 --> 02:34:08.836]  We've got a 9-11 book special.
[02:34:09.216 --> 02:34:10.996]  Two books for $19.95.
[02:34:11.917 --> 02:34:13.997]  That is a huge discount.
[02:34:15.898 --> 02:34:19.519]  We also have a bumper sticker special, where basically the bumper stickers are free.
[02:34:19.539 --> 02:34:23.821]  I think you get, I don't know, 10 or 20 of them, I forget, just for shipping.
[02:34:25.081 --> 02:34:27.342]  And it just goes on and on, folks.
[02:34:27.382 --> 02:34:29.363]  So please take advantage of this.

[02:35:12.478 --> 02:35:34.476]  And you can see all of my 11 films, dozens of other great documentary films by other researchers, two books online, two e-books, my book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV report that normally we do twice a week, we always do once a week, and you can also get the special text reports, the best audio interviews we do, 15 cents a day, prisonplanet.tv.
[02:35:35.136 --> 02:35:35.997]  Please check it out.
[02:35:36.017 --> 02:35:37.178]  You can also give it as a gift.
[02:35:38.113 --> 02:35:46.940]  Go and get a membership, get a passcode and username and then just give that as a gift and a card for friends and family that have basic computer skills.
[02:35:47.140 --> 02:35:52.564]  A five-year-old can go and enter their passcode and username and watch all the video and read the books.
[02:35:53.404 --> 02:36:00.370]  You can go get a membership there and print off the books on paper and give those as gifts.
[02:36:00.450 --> 02:36:01.230]  Put them in a binder.
[02:36:01.731 --> 02:36:03.132]  Just get it out to people.
[02:36:03.212 --> 02:36:06.274]  Bottom line, we're about waking folks up and defending the republic.
[02:36:07.594 --> 02:36:08.635]  Ron in New York.
[02:36:08.655 --> 02:36:09.355]  You're on the air.
[02:36:09.395 --> 02:36:09.755]  Welcome.
[02:36:10.716 --> 02:36:11.216]  Hello, Alex.
[02:36:11.556 --> 02:36:12.116]  Hello, sir.
[02:36:12.336 --> 02:36:19.679]  We have biometric data, or will have it, I'm sure, very soon in our driver's license as a result of this legislation yesterday.
[02:36:19.859 --> 02:36:22.420]  Well, since 1993 we've had it in Texas.
[02:36:22.621 --> 02:36:23.201]  48 states have it.
[02:36:23.441 --> 02:36:25.862]  The digital photo is for a face scan template.
[02:36:26.182 --> 02:36:27.222]  The digital thumbprint.
[02:36:27.863 --> 02:36:28.943]  And now this is bylaw.
[02:36:28.963 --> 02:36:30.244]  You'll have to have it to have a job.
[02:36:30.284 --> 02:36:32.925]  And in the bill, and Ron Paul's press release on this,
[02:36:33.619 --> 02:36:39.866]  Checkpoints with TSA-type employees fondling you and your wife, not just in the airport, but on the roads.
[02:36:40.506 --> 02:36:43.410]  We should just simplify it and call it this, what it is.
[02:36:44.531 --> 02:36:48.095]  In Stalinistic fashion, an internal passport.
[02:36:48.475 --> 02:36:50.177]  That's what Ron Paul's office called it.
[02:36:50.577 --> 02:36:53.380]  That's what Jeff Dice's press secretary called it.
[02:36:53.841 --> 02:36:54.902]  One word, tyranny.
[02:36:55.405 --> 02:36:59.789]  And if you don't have it, you won't be able to accomplish or do a number of things that you may have to do.
[02:36:59.809 --> 02:37:00.669]  Well, look, it's the same thing.
[02:37:00.689 --> 02:37:06.654]  They've given them all ID cards in Iraq, and then in extreme cases like Fallujah, if you don't have an ID card, they kill you on the spot.
[02:37:07.315 --> 02:37:09.257]  Source, NBC Nightly News, Boston Globe.
[02:37:09.797 --> 02:37:19.405]  You know, one thing that came across in your interview with the congressman was what I extrapolated from it in a diplomatic way as he could.
[02:37:20.396 --> 02:37:29.244]  He indicated that what runs American politics, and that's a filthy word in my opinion, American politics, it's two very filthy words, is money.
[02:37:30.065 --> 02:37:31.587]  That's really what it comes down to.
[02:37:32.187 --> 02:37:39.154]  Not what's right or wrong, not even what a majority, even a large majority would want, but the engine that runs it is money.
[02:37:39.634 --> 02:37:43.338]  And that being the case, American politics will never have legitimacy
[02:37:44.085 --> 02:37:56.465]  Because you will always have a small handful of interests with a lot of money who will be running and creating social policy and getting people elected who may not be, and in many cases are not, in favor of what the majority want.
[02:37:57.146 --> 02:37:59.049]  This is what I extrapolated from what he said.
[02:37:59.730 --> 02:38:03.412]  I think what's going to have to happen is we've got to take this fight to a different level.
[02:38:03.492 --> 02:38:09.575]  These people governed by Machiavellian machination, we're going to have to machinate a little bit back ourselves.
[02:38:09.735 --> 02:38:11.236]  Well, you've called for years.
[02:38:11.276 --> 02:38:14.678]  You're a retired New York police officer, and I believe you said detective.
[02:38:15.258 --> 02:38:16.039]  No, not detective.
[02:38:16.079 --> 02:38:16.999]  I was a retired officer.
[02:38:17.159 --> 02:38:18.180]  Okay.
[02:38:18.760 --> 02:38:20.761]  Must be another New York officer who calls in.
[02:38:21.561 --> 02:38:26.424]  But what I'm trying to get to here on this, Ron, is that this is organized crime.
[02:38:27.179 --> 02:38:33.926]  They operate via organized crime, but with an overlay of space-age PR firms or propagandists.
[02:38:34.666 --> 02:38:35.147]  Correct.
[02:38:35.487 --> 02:38:50.382]  And I believe the solution is having people like Judge Roy Moore run in Alabama, and if they don't have the machines in, he can win, to force Ron Paul to run for governor of Texas before all these machines are in place, and to have a ring of states...
[02:38:51.558 --> 02:38:54.500]  Free states across the nation.
[02:38:55.501 --> 02:38:58.483]  To do that, though, we've got to stop the electronic machines from going in.
[02:38:59.372 --> 02:39:04.194]  The electronic machines, the easily manipulated voting machines or processes, that's true.
[02:39:04.214 --> 02:39:11.376]  Plus, it does seem, it does seem, and I do notice this with the American people, Alex, and part of the blame for this goes on the American people.
[02:39:11.436 --> 02:39:13.237]  No matter what anyone says, I do blame them.
[02:39:13.277 --> 02:39:14.277]  They're just uninformed.
[02:39:14.297 --> 02:39:16.178]  Yeah, I mean, people can find out the truth.
[02:39:16.498 --> 02:39:21.479]  They love pop entertainment more than they love things that are very important and integral to their lives.
[02:39:21.699 --> 02:39:22.860]  And you've got to admit that.
[02:39:23.440 --> 02:39:25.581]  They'd rather watch a sports game or a show.
[02:39:25.601 --> 02:39:30.162]  Do you know what was on the cover of two of our major New York papers yesterday, Alex, while this was going on?
[02:39:30.642 --> 02:39:33.904]  This bill that will change our lives, this major piece of legislation.
[02:39:33.944 --> 02:39:36.504]  Do you know what was on the cover of our newspapers here?
[02:39:36.905 --> 02:39:37.265]  I don't know.
[02:39:37.285 --> 02:39:38.045]  Michael Jackson.
[02:39:38.625 --> 02:39:38.845]  No.
[02:39:39.146 --> 02:39:49.935]  That some guy, two stories in the New York Daily News, that some guy gave his girlfriend a $13,000 engagement ring, and that Trump gave his girlfriend some kind of astronomically priced engagement ring.
[02:39:50.316 --> 02:39:55.140]  Well, your democracy was being ripped apart by wolves.
[02:39:55.640 --> 02:39:56.621]  On the cover of our papers.
[02:39:56.681 --> 02:39:58.923]  And you know where the story about the intelligence bill was?
[02:39:59.504 --> 02:40:00.545]  Buried deep in the paper.
[02:40:01.255 --> 02:40:10.421]  And it probably... I didn't find one mainstream article, not a neocon publication, none of them, that said Patriot Act, National ID card.
[02:40:11.001 --> 02:40:14.364]  It was just, don't you want them to be able to communicate and stop Al-Qaeda?
[02:40:14.384 --> 02:40:16.625]  Yeah, but this is basically what it is.
[02:40:16.745 --> 02:40:21.028]  And they trot out surviving members of 9-11 families.
[02:40:21.268 --> 02:40:25.551]  I want to make something clear about that, and I think it's time the line is drawn with this, because sometimes...
[02:40:26.235 --> 02:40:27.877]  Something could go too far regardless.
[02:40:27.917 --> 02:40:29.158]  Yeah, I did say that.
[02:40:29.339 --> 02:40:36.126]  They trot out of thousands of families, 400 families, in just one suit, suing Bush over involvement.
[02:40:37.728 --> 02:40:39.490]  You've got the other suit.
[02:40:40.617 --> 02:40:44.180]  There, with Ellen Mariani against him and a bunch of the victims' families.
[02:40:44.580 --> 02:40:50.064]  You've had families ring the White House three times that I know of with signs saying, Bush knew, Bush did it.
[02:40:50.464 --> 02:40:56.529]  You've had families jump up live on C-SPAN about four different times and scream, the government did it, the government's involved.
[02:40:56.789 --> 02:40:57.870]  That all gets ignored.
[02:40:58.090 --> 02:41:04.354]  And yeah, they trot out three or four families, people who mean well, going, pass this for my family!
[02:41:04.595 --> 02:41:06.036]  Pass this for my family!
[02:41:06.056 --> 02:41:06.496]  Go ahead.
[02:41:06.836 --> 02:41:07.056]  Right.
[02:41:07.237 --> 02:41:08.898]  Well, listen, I'm going to tell you something.
[02:41:09.498 --> 02:41:20.426]  Some may mean well, though my sympathy goes out to them for the loss of their loved ones, it doesn't mean that, A, they're experts, okay, on national security or geonational politics.
[02:41:21.026 --> 02:41:28.451]  B, it doesn't mean that even some of them are not taken up with the celebrity involved, you know, and being trod out and used for that purpose.
[02:41:28.471 --> 02:41:30.032]  And who knows, you know, their egos may...
[02:41:33.448 --> 02:41:55.564]  And it's the same women, and they trot them around, and then you'll see a ten-second blurb on CNN with signs saying, CNN, one time I was watching, I was up in Minnesota visiting the network like two years ago, and CNN said, some of the victims' families protested in a ring around the White House, thousands of them protesting, saying not enough was done.
[02:41:55.624 --> 02:41:58.026]  And then it showed the signs, and it was Bush did it.
[02:41:58.837 --> 02:42:00.258]  But they didn't say anything else about it.
[02:42:00.458 --> 02:42:01.939]  Why don't we see them on TV?
[02:42:02.059 --> 02:42:14.526]  Because the media is controlled, okay, by the same mainstream... Well, if you don't think it's controlled, folks, the media didn't tell you what was in this bill, and then minutes after it passed, they were on TV laughing about it.
[02:42:14.586 --> 02:42:15.147]  Thanks for the call.
[02:42:15.847 --> 02:42:17.688]  They were on TV laughing about it.
[02:42:17.728 --> 02:42:19.069]  They knew what was in it.
[02:42:19.589 --> 02:42:20.450]  Tim in Ohio.
[02:42:20.490 --> 02:42:21.090]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:42:21.690 --> 02:42:22.431]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:42:22.651 --> 02:42:22.911]  Hello.
[02:42:23.031 --> 02:42:24.892]  Another edition of As the World Turns.
[02:42:26.113 --> 02:42:26.773]  Are none of these...
[02:42:36.981 --> 02:42:42.103]  Well, you know, they couldn't impeach Bill Clinton on missile secrets to the CHICOMs because the Republicans were all involved in it.
[02:42:42.123 --> 02:42:46.545]  They had to go after him over, you know, oval office sexual escapades.
[02:42:47.225 --> 02:42:48.586]  And nobody's going to go after Bush.
[02:42:48.626 --> 02:42:50.147]  I mean, the Democrats all voted for this.
[02:42:50.167 --> 02:42:50.627]  They love it.
[02:42:51.067 --> 02:42:53.708]  Yeah, Clinton, you've got to like a man who thinks harass is two words.
[02:42:56.332 --> 02:42:59.334]  I didn't understand that, but Tim, I appreciate the call.
[02:42:59.854 --> 02:43:01.576]  Let's talk to Rosemary in Indiana.
[02:43:01.636 --> 02:43:02.477]  Go ahead, Rosemary.
[02:43:03.097 --> 02:43:03.337]  Yes.
[02:43:04.098 --> 02:43:05.880]  Alex, thank you for accepting my call.
[02:43:07.541 --> 02:43:11.004]  You know, people are afraid.
[02:43:11.024 --> 02:43:19.391]  First off, they don't really understand the depth and what is happening unless they listen to your program a few times.
[02:43:20.049 --> 02:43:47.903]  But one of the things I came up with, because I'm like a little town USA, and I have copied out all of Genesis Communication Network's schedule and their phone numbers and addresses, a lot of the websites that you've had on your radio program, and I'm putting them in my Christmas cards, and I'm sending them out to every person I know, including the newspapers, whether I subscribe to them or not.
[02:43:48.444 --> 02:43:55.332]  Because I think it's time that people woke up and if nothing else, just get that little bit of information out there.
[02:43:55.392 --> 02:43:56.373]  The rest is up to them.
[02:43:57.089 --> 02:43:57.729]  Well, you're right.
[02:43:57.789 --> 02:44:00.610]  We have tens of millions of people that are awake.
[02:44:00.670 --> 02:44:04.471]  And if you all just wake up one person, that's tens of millions more.
[02:44:04.491 --> 02:44:07.152]  If they wake up one more person, that's tens of millions.
[02:44:07.632 --> 02:44:11.553]  And so, yes, it's about not going, look at the size of that thing.
[02:44:11.573 --> 02:44:13.294]  That New World Order is too big, too bad.
[02:44:13.674 --> 02:44:14.814]  It's about engaging it.
[02:44:14.974 --> 02:44:17.855]  And look, don't be disheartened by them passing all this.
[02:44:17.875 --> 02:44:19.315]  Now they've got to try to implement it.
[02:44:20.356 --> 02:44:20.536]  Right.
[02:44:21.256 --> 02:44:24.617]  And they can't implement it if people keep getting a hold of their senators.
[02:44:25.214 --> 02:44:31.618]  Well, they can't implement it if we sue them and get cities to pass laws against it and states to do it, and if we fight it, which we are doing.
[02:44:31.878 --> 02:44:32.979]  Right.
[02:44:33.019 --> 02:44:33.899]  Look, look, look.
[02:44:33.939 --> 02:44:37.922]  The tighter they squeeze, the more they push, the more resistance mounts.
[02:44:38.022 --> 02:44:39.963]  I've never seen an awakening like it.
[02:44:40.463 --> 02:44:41.824]  Everybody's waking up.
[02:44:42.224 --> 02:44:43.645]  Well, it's about time.
[02:44:43.685 --> 02:44:51.490]  But I thought I'd add my two cents and say, when you send out them greeting cards, anniversary cards, birthday cards, regardless, send those little...
[02:44:52.009 --> 02:44:56.892]  Notes along with them, the website, or like you said, get your disc and send it along with them.
[02:44:57.432 --> 02:45:00.634]  So you keep up the good work, and thank you so much for taking my call.
[02:45:01.034 --> 02:45:02.414]  Rosemary, thank you for calling.
[02:45:02.454 --> 02:45:04.175]  God bless you, and have a great holiday.
[02:45:04.636 --> 02:45:06.156]  John in Louisiana.
[02:45:06.216 --> 02:45:06.897]  John, welcome.
[02:45:07.297 --> 02:45:08.858]  Yes, good morning, Alex.
[02:45:09.238 --> 02:45:12.820]  Alex, you know and I know and a few others know that Congress is redundant.
[02:45:14.873 --> 02:45:17.494]  If they were dismissed, we wouldn't be deceived by them.
[02:45:17.914 --> 02:45:22.136]  If we could just get them to go home and stay out of Washington, they have no authority.
[02:45:22.176 --> 02:45:23.556]  They surrendered that in 1933.
[02:45:24.276 --> 02:45:25.717]  But I wanted to talk about... Hold on.
[02:45:25.737 --> 02:45:26.817]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[02:45:27.297 --> 02:45:28.938]  Congress openly on a...
[02:45:30.015 --> 02:45:33.378]  On a congressional basis, every session gives up more of its authority.
[02:45:33.718 --> 02:45:35.419]  They're making themselves irrelevant.
[02:45:35.439 --> 02:45:38.462]  They give up their authority on law enforcement to the executive.
[02:45:38.682 --> 02:45:42.124]  They give up their authority on terrorism and war making to the executive.
[02:45:42.144 --> 02:45:44.807]  They give up their authority on trade to the executive.
[02:45:44.987 --> 02:45:50.451]  They're giving up their authority to the executive or the dictatorial branch en masse.
[02:45:50.471 --> 02:45:50.891]  Go ahead.
[02:45:52.372 --> 02:45:55.435]  Alex, yes, those are charades you've been mentioning there.
[02:45:55.675 --> 02:45:58.317]  They gave up all authority in 1933 on March the 9th
[02:46:00.014 --> 02:46:03.478]  They surrendered all authority and responsibility to the President.
[02:46:03.738 --> 02:46:06.341]  It's been reaffirmed by the Church Senate Committee in 1973.
[02:46:06.742 --> 02:46:11.467]  There's no doubt about it, and very few people on our side want to admit it.
[02:46:11.507 --> 02:46:12.328]  They're in denial.
[02:46:13.416 --> 02:46:21.158]  Well, certainly the executive claimed the power in 1933, confiscated the gold at machine gun point, gave his paper back.
[02:46:21.598 --> 02:46:23.919]  Clearly they began declaring yearly emergencies.
[02:46:23.959 --> 02:46:27.560]  I've seen them do it on C-SPAN to then have control over Congress.
[02:46:27.600 --> 02:46:31.301]  But Congress, the will to stand up is the will to have freedom.
[02:46:31.581 --> 02:46:33.842]  And they can still stand up and still say no.
[02:46:34.102 --> 02:46:40.844]  The problem is most of them are so dirty or are being blackmailed or they die in auto accidents or plane crashes when they say no.
[02:46:42.136 --> 02:46:51.178]  Congress and certain numerous scholars, legal scholars, say that there ain't no way that Congress can reassert their authority after March 9, 1933.
[02:46:51.238 --> 02:46:55.820]  Well, I've seen that, and that's just not the case.
[02:46:56.620 --> 02:46:57.860]  Well, let's talk about money.
[02:46:58.220 --> 02:47:06.222]  There's not going to be an imminent collapse of the dollar, because Japan and China and Europe, they're not going to do that.
[02:47:06.302 --> 02:47:09.103]  It's in their self-interest not to let that happen.
[02:47:09.243 --> 02:47:09.863]  Let me stop you.
[02:47:10.566 --> 02:47:12.207]  There's not going to be an imminent collapse.
[02:47:12.247 --> 02:47:13.248]  It's been devalued by 45%.
[02:47:13.428 --> 02:47:15.910]  Right.
[02:47:15.990 --> 02:47:17.612]  It's going to be a controlled collapse.
[02:47:17.712 --> 02:47:18.792]  It's all in the plan.
[02:47:19.173 --> 02:47:20.434]  It'll be a slow decay.
[02:47:20.654 --> 02:47:28.340]  Well, that was what they said at the Davos Economic Forum three years ago when the euro was 89 cents to a dollar that was worth 100 pennies.
[02:47:32.893 --> 02:47:37.115]  And then now it's dropped by 45%, but no, you're right.
[02:47:37.155 --> 02:47:38.656]  It is a controlled implosion.
[02:47:39.056 --> 02:47:45.279]  Yes, a sudden collapse might bring about unpredictable events, and they don't want that to happen.
[02:47:45.299 --> 02:47:47.780]  They're in control, and they're not going to take a chance on that.
[02:47:48.240 --> 02:47:51.762]  But still, the controlled implosion is still an implosion.
[02:47:52.142 --> 02:47:53.503]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:47:53.563 --> 02:47:55.344]  We're done for on the money scene.
[02:47:55.384 --> 02:47:57.485]  Yes, we're done for, and it's all in the plan.
[02:47:58.605 --> 02:47:59.986]  It's all in the stated plan.
[02:48:00.026 --> 02:48:00.826]  I mean, this is public.
[02:48:01.146 --> 02:48:01.767]  Yes, yes.
[02:48:03.846 --> 02:48:06.189]  If people don't get out of money paper, they're doomed.
[02:48:06.289 --> 02:48:08.511]  A lot of them are going to starve to death.
[02:48:10.053 --> 02:48:16.740]  Well, you know, we had a depression in this country, which was admittedly engineered, that's part of the public record, to consolidate wealth by the elite.
[02:48:18.022 --> 02:48:18.162]  And...
[02:48:19.924 --> 02:48:24.468]  Back then we were moral and 90% of people had skills in gardening.
[02:48:24.768 --> 02:48:25.448]  We farmed.
[02:48:25.488 --> 02:48:26.609]  We were a farming nation.
[02:48:26.649 --> 02:48:27.630]  We could feed ourselves.
[02:48:27.910 --> 02:48:29.391]  We don't exist like that anymore.
[02:48:29.432 --> 02:48:30.112]  We don't farm.
[02:48:30.132 --> 02:48:31.313]  We don't even know how to farm.
[02:48:31.453 --> 02:48:32.634]  You want to know something scary?
[02:48:32.674 --> 02:48:39.800]  One of these Lexus drivers with their manicured little fingernails, you imagine them a month after not having any food or money.
[02:48:39.820 --> 02:48:41.761]  Yeah, the rivers are going to be choked with them, buddy.
[02:48:43.583 --> 02:48:44.784]  Well, they'll grovel to the government.
[02:48:44.804 --> 02:48:45.164]  We'll be back.
[02:48:45.754 --> 02:48:52.617]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:52.917 --> 02:48:54.277]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:54.477 --> 02:48:56.698]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:56.838 --> 02:48:58.939]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:59.199 --> 02:49:04.141]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:04.481 --> 02:49:08.503]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:08.763 --> 02:49:10.544]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:10.624 --> 02:49:21.272]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.412 --> 02:49:23.313]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:51:58.042 --> 02:52:01.323]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[02:52:01.803 --> 02:52:04.124]  Wide open phones, bunch of news coming up the next hour.
[02:52:05.464 --> 02:52:17.968]  Talking about passage of large sections of Patriot Act II, a national ID card provision yesterday by the Senate, and the media that wouldn't talk about those provisions suddenly running out celebrating openly, I mean literally, smiling, laughing.
[02:52:19.479 --> 02:52:24.440]  On TV, these scum that work for Fox and others just get off on laughing at us.
[02:52:25.301 --> 02:52:26.921]  They feel like they're part of the power system.
[02:52:26.981 --> 02:52:28.641]  Oh, you cattle are in our cages.
[02:52:28.681 --> 02:52:29.622]  We've got you now.
[02:52:30.542 --> 02:52:31.642]  Tom in Arizona.
[02:52:31.722 --> 02:52:32.582]  Tom, you're on the air.
[02:52:32.642 --> 02:52:33.082]  Go ahead.
[02:52:33.643 --> 02:52:37.724]  Yes, Alex, I was shocked when I hit your site yesterday and read that.
[02:52:37.964 --> 02:52:43.725]  I mean, it's like revelation coming true in small incrementalism steps.
[02:52:45.207 --> 02:52:45.728]  Read what?
[02:52:45.808 --> 02:52:47.029]  Read about the legislation?
[02:52:47.069 --> 02:52:47.950]  Yes, exactly.
[02:52:47.990 --> 02:52:51.053]  Yeah, I mean, where else do you find it but from Ron Paul or our website?
[02:52:51.653 --> 02:52:54.836]  And after it passed, though, it was all over TV last night.
[02:52:55.076 --> 02:52:55.917]  You don't find it.
[02:52:56.137 --> 02:53:05.065]  And what I immediately did is I emailed everybody I knew with the link to write your local state representative to vote against it.
[02:53:07.027 --> 02:53:08.528]  And I had another question about...
[02:53:10.003 --> 02:53:13.045]  Homeland Security hired the ex-Nazi guy.
[02:53:13.125 --> 02:53:14.446]  Marcus, what was his last name?
[02:53:14.466 --> 02:53:14.926]  I forget.
[02:53:15.307 --> 02:53:16.247]  It's Wolf.
[02:53:16.427 --> 02:53:18.129]  And he wasn't a Nazi.
[02:53:18.669 --> 02:53:19.750]  He was actually Jewish.
[02:53:20.670 --> 02:53:23.632]  The Silver Fox was the Stasi chief in East Germany.
[02:53:24.533 --> 02:53:25.594]  Oh, okay, okay.
[02:53:25.894 --> 02:53:34.480]  So is that confirmed, or is it still... Well, the others, it is confirmed that as consultants they hired former KGB bosses.
[02:53:34.960 --> 02:53:35.861]  That is confirmed.
[02:53:36.728 --> 02:53:42.853]  And it has not been denied, we've called about Marcus Wolfe, and we know he has done some consulting.
[02:53:43.253 --> 02:53:46.175]  I did find where he'd written some books with neocons and stuff.
[02:53:47.196 --> 02:53:52.400]  And we know they're consulting with Israel, and we know he lives part of the time in Israel now, and it looks like it's accurate.
[02:53:53.853 --> 02:54:00.099]  And how can people deny this, that they're implementing a, I would say, Nazi-like state in America?
[02:54:00.159 --> 02:54:01.780]  Well, the Stasi kept everybody safe.
[02:54:01.801 --> 02:54:02.541]  They were good people.
[02:54:02.842 --> 02:54:03.502]  Oh, of course.
[02:54:03.542 --> 02:54:08.667]  Marcus Wolff was the architect of 1 in 10 being a spy, and they are setting up the tips program and the rest of it.
[02:54:08.687 --> 02:54:09.348]  What's wrong with that?
[02:54:11.732 --> 02:54:17.394]  This new bill they passed yesterday, though, that Bush is going to sign, it makes it easier for the illegal aliens.
[02:54:17.414 --> 02:54:18.454]  You heard Congressman Paul.
[02:54:18.854 --> 02:54:19.414]  It's in there.
[02:54:19.694 --> 02:54:23.635]  It makes it easier, more open borders, but that's okay.
[02:54:23.935 --> 02:54:34.058]  You know, I have a friend who lives in Germany, and I send her links and emails and stuff on stories, and she says that what is happening in America now is...
[02:54:34.827 --> 02:54:35.207]  Thank you.
[02:54:35.227 --> 02:54:35.947]  Good to hear from you.
[02:55:03.982 --> 02:55:06.984]  My friends, people ask, why would they want tyranny?
[02:55:07.024 --> 02:55:09.065]  Why would a government want to do something bad?
[02:55:09.706 --> 02:55:11.607]  Well, why in history is that the norm?
[02:55:11.747 --> 02:55:13.048]  Freedom being the exception.
[02:55:13.868 --> 02:55:17.110]  America is America because we have the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:55:17.270 --> 02:55:18.371]  That's why we're America.
[02:55:18.651 --> 02:55:19.752]  You get rid of that, folks.
[02:55:19.772 --> 02:55:21.053]  We're not America anymore.
[02:55:22.294 --> 02:55:23.815]  What can people not understand about that?
[02:55:23.835 --> 02:55:26.096]  People say, well, why would they want tyranny?
[02:55:26.836 --> 02:55:28.017]  It's a straitjacket.
[02:55:28.117 --> 02:55:32.280]  Before a criminal has their way with you, before they rob you or rape you or whatever...
[02:55:33.180 --> 02:55:34.521]  They want to tie you up.
[02:55:35.221 --> 02:55:37.302]  We're being tied up right now.
[02:55:38.422 --> 02:55:42.764]  So they can then take the pension funds, take the private property.
[02:55:43.144 --> 02:55:44.144]  It won't be free market.
[02:55:44.164 --> 02:55:48.966]  It will be select corporations acting in a criminal manner through governmental powers doing this to us.
[02:55:49.906 --> 02:55:51.507]  Now this is the reality.
[02:55:53.709 --> 02:55:55.451]  But we don't have to go along with it.
[02:55:55.491 --> 02:56:03.077]  This could only succeed if we get fearful and get behind it and don't stand up for ourselves or our neighbors or our communities.
[02:56:04.278 --> 02:56:06.840]  This could only happen if we're not engaged.
[02:56:09.983 --> 02:56:17.269]  So pick a liberty issue, whether it's property rights, the Second Amendment, sovereignty of the open borders, fighting the free trade area of the Americas.
[02:56:18.050 --> 02:56:18.931]  Pick an issue.
[02:56:18.951 --> 02:56:21.353]  Get involved on that issue.
[02:56:22.933 --> 02:56:26.298]  And create and expand the alternative media.
[02:56:28.501 --> 02:56:30.564]  Look, this is the beginning of the end for the New World Order.
[02:56:30.604 --> 02:56:33.108]  They are going to fail and fail mildly.
