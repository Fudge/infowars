[00:00:05.954 --> 00:00:06.614]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.255 --> 00:00:08.336]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.036 --> 00:00:10.137]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.797 --> 00:00:11.618]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.358 --> 00:00:13.279]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:17.562]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:22.245]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:32.873]  All right, my friends.
[00:00:35.504 --> 00:00:42.628]  Here we are, live, on this Tuesday edition, the 20th day of July, 2004.
[00:00:42.668 --> 00:00:45.870]  I had him on a few weeks ago.
[00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.853]  He'll be joining us again today because there's so much to talk about because the listeners wanted him back.
[00:00:50.953 --> 00:01:04.041]  Galen Ross, Robert Galen Ross, author of Who's Who of the Elite, and also written some other books concerning the New World Order, worked for the National Security Agency way back in the late 50s,
[00:01:05.754 --> 00:01:13.759]  And then, of course, was a consultant for large oil companies and lived all over the world, including the Middle East.
[00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:25.746]  He'll be here to talk about the New World Order with us, as well as Paul Watson, who joins us once a week, the webmaster for prisonplanet.com, and my wife is the webmaster of infowars.com.
[00:01:25.786 --> 00:01:30.549]  Paul Watson is the webmaster for prisonplanet.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[00:01:34.307 --> 00:01:36.128]  Oh, there is so much news to cover.
[00:01:36.168 --> 00:01:37.850]  We're also going to have open phones.
[00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.291]  Go to your calls early in this first hour.
[00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:41.452]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:41.472 --> 00:01:44.174]  Bush vows to keep searching for IranLink to September 11th.
[00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.350]  Al-Qaeda is in Afghanistan.
[00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.811]  Boom!
[00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:57.571]  Al-Qaeda is in Iraq.
[00:01:57.651 --> 00:01:58.051]  Boom!
[00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:01.772]  Oh no, now Al-Qaeda is in Iran.
[00:02:01.912 --> 00:02:03.012]  Now they're in Syria.
[00:02:03.052 --> 00:02:04.433]  Now they're in your backyard.
[00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:07.473]  Now all misdemeanor crimes aid Al-Qaeda.
[00:02:07.493 --> 00:02:11.954]  You've got to be secretly arrested and put in the terrorist-owned private prisons.
[00:02:12.014 --> 00:02:18.796]  The terrorists that bring in the drugs and run America, also own the prisons, are going to put you and I and many others, if we don't stop them, into them.
[00:02:21.724 --> 00:02:28.187]  Despite CIA skepticism, don't worry, you'll be blamed in six months for it, President Bush says the U.S.
[00:02:28.227 --> 00:02:33.670]  is investigating whether Iran played any role in September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
[00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.131]  And Israel's saying they're getting ready to attack Iran.
[00:02:37.211 --> 00:02:39.032]  Iran's saying they're going to nuke Israel.
[00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:42.454]  Well, World War III would actually make the globalists quite happy.
[00:02:43.192 --> 00:02:45.673]  Imagine the police state they'd set up here in America.
[00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:48.334]  Cancel the election.
[00:02:48.814 --> 00:02:50.475]  Be big bosses.
[00:02:50.495 --> 00:02:52.736]  Oh, they'd just hate to do that.
[00:02:53.556 --> 00:03:00.699]  As to direct connections, we're digging into the facts to determine if there was one, Mr. Bush said on Monday.
[00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:18.975]  Yeah, that's exactly what the Iranians would do, would be to come and punch the 800-pound gorilla in the nose when they are the equivalent of an anorexic 85-year-old Ethiopian who can hardly get up off their grass mat, who's covered with flies.
[00:03:20.461 --> 00:03:23.302]  That's exactly what the 85-pound Ethiopian does.
[00:03:23.342 --> 00:03:30.123]  They get up and they punch the 800-pound gorilla with 14-inch fangs dripping acid out with giant red eyes.
[00:03:30.483 --> 00:03:32.664]  That's exactly what the Arabs are really doing.
[00:03:33.284 --> 00:03:38.866]  Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, they're all saying, You're behind the terror!
[00:03:38.906 --> 00:03:39.966]  You're blowing stuff up!
[00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:41.286]  You're doing this to destabilize!
[00:03:41.306 --> 00:03:42.686]  You want to come in and take over?
[00:03:43.127 --> 00:03:44.027]  No, it's not us!
[00:03:44.047 --> 00:03:44.947]  We wouldn't dare do it!
[00:03:44.987 --> 00:03:45.367]  Please!
[00:03:45.527 --> 00:03:46.647]  They're about to crush us!
[00:03:46.928 --> 00:03:47.488]  Oh, no!
[00:03:47.768 --> 00:03:48.508]  Please, no!
[00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:59.561]  As the forces, the aircraft carriers, line up and get ready, and they have the mini-nukes ready, and, oh, it's so much fun, and here domestically it's slave time.
[00:04:01.042 --> 00:04:06.523]  While people sit around in their easy chairs with 12 packs of beer going, yeah, I'm going to watch some more bills blow up.
[00:04:06.824 --> 00:04:08.224]  It's like a football game.
[00:04:08.604 --> 00:04:15.306]  You know, Domino's Pizza and other pizza chains said their record sales were the beginning of the bombardment last year against Iraq.
[00:04:17.108 --> 00:04:18.309]  I talked to liquor store owners.
[00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.710]  They said they'd never seen such alcohol purchasing.
[00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.472]  I mean, you thought Christmas and New Year's and Thanksgiving were time for drunkenness.
[00:04:25.892 --> 00:04:27.533]  Drunk driving exploded.
[00:04:27.593 --> 00:04:36.777]  Just absolute celebration of mentally defunct sickos who sat there simulating power and control with the elite.
[00:04:37.918 --> 00:04:39.118]  I'm part of the power.
[00:04:39.138 --> 00:04:39.879]  I'm part of it.
[00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:42.600]  I want to kill some more people.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.461]  Torture ain't so bad.
[00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:48.029]  We'll get into this and much more when we return.
[00:04:49.011 --> 00:04:53.821]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and the war is really here at home.
[00:04:53.901 --> 00:04:54.964]  It's against you and your family.
[00:04:55.004 --> 00:04:56.447]  Hope you enjoy the new draft that's coming.
[00:04:56.487 --> 00:04:56.908]  Stay with us.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.245]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.666 --> 00:05:13.910]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:21.177]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.557 --> 00:05:27.663]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.683 --> 00:05:29.024]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.224 --> 00:05:29.664]  We're good to go.
[00:05:46.133 --> 00:05:49.277]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:05:49.297 --> 00:05:49.398]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.418 --> 00:05:49.518]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.658 --> 00:05:50.579]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:50.799]  Call today.
[00:06:01.084 --> 00:06:02.586]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:02.766 --> 00:06:05.869]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:06:05.989 --> 00:06:09.872]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:06:09.932 --> 00:06:14.197]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State to the Takeover.
[00:06:14.537 --> 00:06:18.300]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.262]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:06:20.442 --> 00:06:23.766]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:06:23.806 --> 00:06:24.887]  The medical bills.
[00:06:26.547 --> 00:06:28.508]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:06:28.648 --> 00:06:31.689]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:34.770]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:41.353]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:06:41.873 --> 00:06:42.393]  We're good to go.
[00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:08.600]  Skyrocketing oil prices, the economy on the brink, the plunging dollar, terrorism, the government spending $1.80 for every dollar it collects.
[00:07:08.921 --> 00:07:14.206]  Never in the history of our country have we faced so many threats to our freedoms, rights, and individual security.
[00:07:14.387 --> 00:07:16.989]  How long can we continue without a fracture occurring?
[00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:22.215]  With the events that recently rocked the elections in Spain, what will happen as we get closer to our own elections?
[00:07:22.735 --> 00:07:25.217]  Now is the time to begin preparing for such threats.
[00:07:25.497 --> 00:07:30.240]  Ready Reserve Foods has been helping businesses, government, and individuals for over 32 years.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:40.366]  No matter what your preparation needs, Ready Reserve Foods offers virtually the finest in dehydrated, nitrogen-packed, long-term storable foods and has food units to fit your particular needs.
[00:07:40.746 --> 00:07:41.147]  Big Brother.
[00:07:41.187 --> 00:07:41.867]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.131 --> 00:08:08.212]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.893 --> 00:08:09.994]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.654 --> 00:08:11.475]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.236 --> 00:08:13.136]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.156 --> 00:08:17.740]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.981 --> 00:08:22.104]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:26.128 --> 00:08:31.833]  The whole world is falling deeper into tyranny as we speak.
[00:08:32.553 --> 00:08:32.954]  Right now.
[00:08:35.888 --> 00:08:40.470]  And terrorism is the pretext to do it, whether it's England or France or the United States.
[00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:44.191]  Our governments are all owned by the same central banking cartels.
[00:08:46.892 --> 00:08:57.436]  And just a side issue, because it's so interesting, you know, I'd say, I don't know, about a third of the packages, because I sell videos, documentary films, political diatribes, analysis, books.
[00:08:58.316 --> 00:09:01.117]  About a third of the films and books we try to ship to Canada...
[00:09:01.838 --> 00:09:07.663]  Are ripped open, the contents are stolen, and empty boxes are shipped to the people that purchase the stuff.
[00:09:09.064 --> 00:09:10.105]  The good folks up there.
[00:09:10.745 --> 00:09:17.831]  Or, on many occasions, I've gotten letters back from customs saying it is an acceptable material, that it's anti-government.
[00:09:18.571 --> 00:09:24.075]  You know, just simple analysis and documentation from legislation and just the facts.
[00:09:25.717 --> 00:09:29.840]  And when I ship stuff to Europe, we use the Global Express, the USPS,
[00:09:31.074 --> 00:09:37.239]  Because you don't have to fill out 14 sheets of paper describing exactly what you're shipping.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.681]  If you use UPS or FedEx, you do.
[00:09:40.742 --> 00:09:52.172]  But Sky Television was over here a few weeks ago interviewing myself and others for a five-part series they're making, I think called Conspiracies.
[00:09:52.895 --> 00:09:53.676]  We're good to go.
[00:09:53.696 --> 00:09:54.397]  We're good to go.
[00:10:16.678 --> 00:10:26.743]  Try to mail it to them Thursday, and then we get a call back, oh, you didn't fill out all the forms right, so we fill them out again Friday, and then nobody calls me, and the British call me and go, where is the tape today?
[00:10:26.803 --> 00:10:31.506]  So I call, and they go, oh, it's at the office in Austin, FedEx.
[00:10:32.426 --> 00:10:34.667]  You've got to give more descriptions of what it is.
[00:10:35.107 --> 00:10:40.670]  It's not enough that it says, you know, political TV show, hour-long, Austin, Texas.
[00:10:42.771 --> 00:10:44.212]  That is not enough.
[00:10:45.813 --> 00:10:58.141]  And I'm sure it probably won't be mailed after that either, but I just thought I'd... I said, you know, you might refund their money, 50, 60 bucks, whatever it was, for two-day delivery to England.
[00:10:58.941 --> 00:11:00.422]  And, oh, no, can't do that.
[00:11:00.502 --> 00:11:04.905]  I go, oh, you just take something in on Thursday and it hadn't been mailed out on Tuesday.
[00:11:05.991 --> 00:11:09.052]  So I just thought I would just let folks know about FedEx.
[00:11:09.652 --> 00:11:16.334]  And they say, well, FedEx is just complying with government regulations, and we didn't know about these new ones from England.
[00:11:17.174 --> 00:11:23.356]  And I said, oh, what's next, a transcript of every word that's in a film or anything for that matter?
[00:11:25.828 --> 00:11:32.752]  By the way, if the USPS doesn't have to do it, I haven't looked at the regulations, I guarantee you FedEx and UPS don't have to.
[00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:34.873]  This is just something they're doing.
[00:11:35.333 --> 00:11:36.734]  I have gotten that from them.
[00:11:36.774 --> 00:11:38.655]  It's like some type of agreement.
[00:11:40.136 --> 00:11:51.682]  But so for Canadians that like to sit up there and talk about how corrupt America is and what a police state we are, I just want to tell you, you've got an incredibly corrupt government.
[00:11:51.702 --> 00:11:54.103]  I mean, we've had problems with Canada for years.
[00:11:54.969 --> 00:12:01.553]  But if I want to ship something into Saudi Arabia or something into some African country, oh, no problem.
[00:12:01.653 --> 00:12:03.194]  No problem at all.
[00:12:04.635 --> 00:12:07.977]  But you want to ship something to the free Western world.
[00:12:09.858 --> 00:12:10.498]  It's incredible.
[00:12:10.938 --> 00:12:15.521]  I'll never forget when the British media was here, I guess four years ago.
[00:12:15.661 --> 00:12:16.882]  We were out at Bohemian Grove.
[00:12:17.526 --> 00:12:24.349]  And we made copies of the footage we got of the ritual going on inside the Grove that the San Francisco Chronicle wrote up yesterday.
[00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:26.350]  A big 14-page article, by the way.
[00:12:27.651 --> 00:12:32.793]  And we made copies of the tapes right there in the hotel room, camera to camera, and then they got back to England and they were erased.
[00:12:32.993 --> 00:12:34.414]  So we mailed them more.
[00:12:35.114 --> 00:12:35.814]  Those got erased.
[00:12:35.834 --> 00:12:37.415]  So we finally mailed some to their L.A.
[00:12:37.515 --> 00:12:41.977]  office and then they gave it a false label and had an employee mail it to England and it got there no problem.
[00:12:43.378 --> 00:12:43.978]  So this is the...
[00:12:44.784 --> 00:12:50.369]  Just the case point example of this going on right here in the United States.
[00:12:51.469 --> 00:12:54.432]  But it isn't going on inside the U.S.
[00:12:54.452 --> 00:12:56.654]  that we know of because they don't have the personnel.
[00:12:57.154 --> 00:12:59.256]  But Europe and Canada, it is.
[00:12:59.436 --> 00:13:00.877]  So that's your freedom.
[00:13:00.897 --> 00:13:06.061]  So I guess we can all cower and just shut up and go along with whatever corruption they bring out or they'll get us.
[00:13:06.221 --> 00:13:08.663]  No, they're the bad people running government.
[00:13:08.683 --> 00:13:10.665]  We need to stand up against them.
[00:13:11.505 --> 00:13:15.888]  And I'm getting more and more sick and tired of it.
[00:13:16.788 --> 00:13:23.733]  I mean, if we'll put up with a yearly census with hundreds of questions, a little tattletale dossier on ourselves, they'll do it.
[00:13:24.293 --> 00:13:30.798]  If we'll put up with nine toll roads in Austin on existing highways just to get on the roads paying tolls, they'll do it.
[00:13:31.298 --> 00:13:33.259]  If we'll put up with gun control, they'll do it.
[00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:37.482]  If we'll put up with open borders, they'll swing them even wider open.
[00:13:38.229 --> 00:13:45.810]  If we'll put up with them psychologically testing every child in public school and trying to force deadly drugs on them, they'll do it.
[00:13:46.511 --> 00:13:52.232]  If we'll put up with urban warfare training drills with the military on our streets and the end of Posse Comitatus, they'll do it.
[00:13:52.832 --> 00:14:05.654]  If we'll put up with the exterminator and the cable guy and the phone man spying on you when they're in your home for any misdemeanor crimes because, you know, it's a war on terror, they'll do it.
[00:14:06.648 --> 00:14:08.670]  If we'll put up with this, they'll do it, folks.
[00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:13.054]  And they've got their big fat media to tell us how great it is and how it's to keep us safe.
[00:14:13.435 --> 00:14:18.539]  Oh, you can't protest now because it might cause a public disturbance.
[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.442]  Oh, you know, because your First Amendment might be a problem.
[00:14:21.542 --> 00:14:24.986]  Oh, you've got to answer our questions now when we come knock on your door.
[00:14:25.026 --> 00:14:26.987]  There's no Fifth Amendment, the Supreme Court says.
[00:14:28.108 --> 00:14:29.610]  And if we put up with it, they'll do it.
[00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:30.691]  They'll expand it.
[00:14:32.995 --> 00:14:34.797]  I mean, corruption has gone to seed.
[00:14:34.877 --> 00:14:36.578]  It's just wild right now.
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:42.864]  But again, it's all done by regulation.
[00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:44.845]  The average cop isn't evil.
[00:14:44.905 --> 00:14:46.227]  The average bureaucrat isn't evil.
[00:14:46.267 --> 00:14:50.030]  They just follow their orders in their own little compartmentalized area.
[00:14:51.645 --> 00:14:58.347]  And they're disciplined to that, and this is the procedure, the regulation, not the law, and they just do it.
[00:14:58.407 --> 00:15:04.349]  Well, our regulations say we can stop every car on the highway and search every vehicle as if you're guilty until proven innocent.
[00:15:04.749 --> 00:15:06.330]  The Bill of Rights says it's a fraud.
[00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:08.310]  Our history says it's a fraud.
[00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:09.731]  Common sense says it's wrong.
[00:15:10.531 --> 00:15:13.312]  But, hey, if the government says it's a regulation, you better do it.
[00:15:15.433 --> 00:15:19.754]  You know, all the land-grabbing liberals loved it back when they'd say,
[00:15:20.743 --> 00:15:23.964]  You know, if you own 100 acres, you can't build but on 25% of it.
[00:15:24.004 --> 00:15:24.764]  Oh, that's good.
[00:15:24.824 --> 00:15:25.944]  You know, save the environment.
[00:15:26.324 --> 00:15:31.626]  But now in many states they're saying, well, if you own more than an acre and a half, you can't build on it.
[00:15:31.866 --> 00:15:32.586]  Just everywhere.
[00:15:32.666 --> 00:15:33.646]  Statewide zoning.
[00:15:33.926 --> 00:15:35.187]  How's that sound to you?
[00:15:35.527 --> 00:15:40.288]  Of course, if you're a good old boy, all the restrictions get selectively taken off you.
[00:15:40.308 --> 00:15:42.008]  But if you're an average Joe, forget it.
[00:15:42.028 --> 00:15:46.309]  I mean, you want to be a serf, you want to be a slave, folks?
[00:15:47.169 --> 00:15:47.770]  It's happening.
[00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:49.570]  It's developing.
[00:15:50.296 --> 00:15:50.696]  Right now.
[00:15:52.297 --> 00:15:53.799]  So here's some of the articles we're going to go over.
[00:15:53.859 --> 00:15:57.241]  Bush vows to keep searching for Iran linked to September 11th.
[00:15:57.321 --> 00:15:59.903]  As PNAC said, they're going to invade 63 countries.
[00:16:01.304 --> 00:16:04.626]  AP Clinton advisor probed in terror memos.
[00:16:05.307 --> 00:16:06.267]  Sandy Berger.
[00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:08.749]  I see.
[00:16:08.889 --> 00:16:09.910]  Boy, he's covering up 9-11.
[00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.911]  It's all Clinton.
[00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:13.733]  British military helicopter crashes in Iraq.
[00:16:13.873 --> 00:16:14.353]  One dead.
[00:16:15.614 --> 00:16:15.734]  U.S.
[00:16:15.774 --> 00:16:19.817]  media kill story of Iraq Prime Minister executing six prisoners.
[00:16:20.728 --> 00:16:22.409]  It's all over the British and French press.
[00:16:22.449 --> 00:16:22.810]  Not here.
[00:16:24.191 --> 00:16:24.711]  Is the U.S.
[00:16:24.731 --> 00:16:26.732]  becoming a nation of snitches?
[00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:27.773]  I want to go over this article.
[00:16:29.134 --> 00:16:30.035]  The Associated Press.
[00:16:30.395 --> 00:16:32.517]  Crime database sparks privacy fears.
[00:16:33.157 --> 00:16:35.379]  The format of a crime and terrorism database.
[00:16:35.399 --> 00:16:36.720]  See, crime and terrorism.
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:37.880]  See, now it's crime and terror.
[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.302]  First it was for terror, but now it's crime.
[00:16:39.742 --> 00:16:41.223]  Database known as Matrix.
[00:16:41.843 --> 00:16:43.284]  People still won't believe me when I say that.
[00:16:43.364 --> 00:16:44.445]  It's called Matrix, folks.
[00:16:44.946 --> 00:16:45.286]  It's being...
[00:16:46.033 --> 00:16:51.734]  Change to allay privacy and legal concerns that led several states to drop out of the federally funded project.
[00:16:53.675 --> 00:16:55.395]  Oh, we're going to change a few things about it.
[00:16:57.595 --> 00:17:00.516]  Instead of shooting you in the head with a .45, we'll shoot you in the head with a .357.
[00:17:01.596 --> 00:17:02.816]  It's a smaller round.
[00:17:02.836 --> 00:17:04.117]  Of course, it's not.
[00:17:04.337 --> 00:17:06.597]  That's, again, another parallel or analogy.
[00:17:07.317 --> 00:17:11.278]  Mexican government promotes myth of RFID and plannable microchip security.
[00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:12.438]  Here's the St.
[00:17:12.498 --> 00:17:14.859]  Petersburg Times.
[00:17:16.813 --> 00:17:17.274]  It says St.
[00:17:17.294 --> 00:17:21.296]  Petersburg considers no protest zones, and it's not just for the Democrats or Republicans.
[00:17:21.336 --> 00:17:27.401]  Officials worry that protests near Baywalk and Tropicana Field threaten public safety.
[00:17:28.241 --> 00:17:28.421]  St.
[00:17:28.441 --> 00:17:36.407]  Petersburg, Chris Ernesto, and about 25 colleagues gather outside Baywalk every Saturday night to voice their frustration about the situation in Iraq.
[00:17:37.034 --> 00:17:38.255]  Well, that's going to be banned.
[00:17:38.615 --> 00:17:40.577]  You can't be on the streets of the city doing it.
[00:17:40.617 --> 00:17:48.905]  They're going to give them little protest zones and a little league baseball field where they can go protest where no one can see them.
[00:17:49.906 --> 00:17:52.468]  Again, you're allowed to protest just in zones, special zones.
[00:17:53.249 --> 00:17:54.530]  Waving banners that say U.S.
[00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:55.571]  out of Iraq and...
[00:17:56.609 --> 00:17:57.610]  Fire the liar!
[00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:04.674]  They distribute literature and explain their views on the hundreds of people who flock to the entertainment and shopping complex.
[00:18:04.794 --> 00:18:10.398]  It's the most high traffic area in the city, the place with the highest exposure, said Ernesto, a member of St.
[00:18:10.878 --> 00:18:11.639]  Pete for Peace.
[00:18:12.139 --> 00:18:15.001]  Other groups agree and chose Baywalk for their protest, too.
[00:18:15.481 --> 00:18:20.905]  Now city officials say demonstrators are creating a public safety hazard by pushing pedestrians into streets.
[00:18:21.685 --> 00:18:28.907]  Again, they have proposed designating pedestrian safety zones outside Baywalk and Tropicana Field where picketing would not be allowed.
[00:18:30.387 --> 00:18:36.569]  The city's legal staff said zones won't place illegal limits on freedom of speech.
[00:18:36.669 --> 00:18:37.869]  Oh, sure, it just will.
[00:18:38.369 --> 00:18:39.110]  More doublespeak.
[00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:43.171]  Because the protests still will have reasonable access to the areas where they want to demonstrate.
[00:18:43.551 --> 00:18:48.312]  But at least one legal scholar said the city may be in danger of violating the state and federal...
[00:18:49.355 --> 00:18:50.115]  Constitutions.
[00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:51.096]  Well, so what?
[00:18:51.136 --> 00:18:52.497]  I mean, there's people going to prison.
[00:18:53.917 --> 00:18:57.899]  Every month I see an article where somebody stands up with a sign that says, no blood for oil.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:04.343]  There'll be 500 Bush supporters on a public street, and the Secret Service walks over and says, arrest that man.
[00:19:04.403 --> 00:19:05.543]  No protest allowed.
[00:19:05.943 --> 00:19:08.625]  They arrest, and federal judge says, you're going down, buddy.
[00:19:10.226 --> 00:19:16.529]  If you choose to walk on public property and demonstrate, then I have the constitutional right to do that, said Robert N. Davis, professor at
[00:19:17.259 --> 00:19:19.560]  Stanton University College of Law.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:24.602]  The plan will be presented to the city council at a workshop August 2nd and is scheduled for a public hearing August 5th.
[00:19:25.243 --> 00:19:30.705]  Well, in Tampa, before 9-11, this is three years ago, we even had the folks on.
[00:19:32.326 --> 00:19:34.046]  They put up face-scanning cameras.
[00:19:34.066 --> 00:19:35.127]  People protested those.
[00:19:35.587 --> 00:19:39.469]  And the cops came and arrested them and said, those cameras bring you justice.
[00:19:40.349 --> 00:19:43.911]  And because you're protesting those cameras, you're obstructing justice.
[00:19:44.971 --> 00:19:46.732]  We are arresting you.
[00:19:49.113 --> 00:19:50.214]  All part of the new freedom.
[00:19:50.254 --> 00:19:54.017]  We have to suspend the election because the terrorists might want to disrupt it.
[00:19:54.037 --> 00:19:55.037]  You know, for safety.
[00:19:55.578 --> 00:19:57.259]  Everything's for safety now, see?
[00:19:57.619 --> 00:19:58.500]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.161]  A lot more news in your calls coming up.
[00:20:01.582 --> 00:20:10.190]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:21.660]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.561]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:20:24.901 --> 00:20:31.342]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled, and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:20:31.522 --> 00:20:33.383]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:20:33.583 --> 00:20:39.604]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[00:20:39.845 --> 00:20:45.506]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:20:45.846 --> 00:20:49.793]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:20:49.813 --> 00:20:50.514]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:20:50.534 --> 00:20:51.215]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:01.465 --> 00:21:02.847]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:21:16.365 --> 00:21:20.228]  The TA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:21:20.348 --> 00:21:20.809]  Fragrance?
[00:21:21.169 --> 00:21:25.953]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:21:26.073 --> 00:21:30.757]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:21:30.998 --> 00:21:33.460]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.202]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:21:37.362 --> 00:21:40.923]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:21:41.104 --> 00:21:43.465]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:21:43.625 --> 00:21:44.505]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.881]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[00:22:05.401 --> 00:22:08.822]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[00:22:09.322 --> 00:22:09.982]  Let's update.
[00:22:10.502 --> 00:22:15.243]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[00:22:15.864 --> 00:22:18.324]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:19.965]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[00:22:19.985 --> 00:22:22.305]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[00:22:22.826 --> 00:22:23.726]  Today, the U.S.
[00:22:23.766 --> 00:22:25.986]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[00:22:26.387 --> 00:22:27.927]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:22:28.487 --> 00:22:30.448]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283%.
[00:22:31.826 --> 00:22:32.687]  We're good to go.
[00:22:32.707 --> 00:22:33.247]  We're good to go.
[00:23:02.054 --> 00:23:03.054]  It's finally here.
[00:23:03.194 --> 00:23:04.175]  Spring has arrived.
[00:23:04.355 --> 00:23:07.336]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:23:07.536 --> 00:23:10.997]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:23:11.217 --> 00:23:19.360]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the ARC Institute's brand new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:23.361]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[00:23:23.561 --> 00:23:28.583]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.

[00:23:45.143 --> 00:23:50.606]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[00:23:50.806 --> 00:23:52.727]  Call the Ark Institute toll free at 800-255-1912.

[00:24:12.404 --> 00:24:18.128]  World history is one example of governments enslaving populations after another.
[00:24:18.148 --> 00:24:23.151]  We only measure civilization by the degree of control and enslavement.
[00:24:24.291 --> 00:24:33.437]  But somehow they convinced the yuppie, the hippie generation, the World War II generation, before that to a certain extent, but it's gotten worse and worse.
[00:24:34.483 --> 00:24:38.205]  That tyranny doesn't exist, that anyone that talks about it is crazy.
[00:24:38.545 --> 00:24:46.229]  Now, that's at one time in our minds, but at the same time with doublethink, it exists with whoever our government wants to invade and attack and destroy.
[00:24:48.991 --> 00:24:58.476]  And so we see patented, classical tyranny unfolding in front of us, and the average person just can't even deal with it.
[00:25:00.717 --> 00:25:02.638]  We'll go to some calls, and then we'll get into...
[00:25:05.652 --> 00:25:09.973]  An article out of the Orlando Sentinel with the Tidal Tail program, which is nationwide, by the way.
[00:25:10.793 --> 00:25:20.716]  Part of the Matrix system, or what you know as the TIPS system, they give the same programs different names to confuse the population for workers spying on you in your home.
[00:25:20.736 --> 00:25:23.637]  But don't worry, they're going to change the program because of protest.
[00:25:23.677 --> 00:25:27.018]  It won't be racial in nature, as if it ever was meant to be.
[00:25:27.558 --> 00:25:32.059]  Also, I have a whole stack of news with government nerve-gassing its groups on purpose and killing them.
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:34.700]  Just to see what it'll do to you.
[00:25:36.304 --> 00:25:37.425]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:26:04.915 --> 00:26:10.756]  Listen, I was sitting there yesterday and seen Inside Edition, and they've done a real good piece on Skull and Bones.
[00:26:10.816 --> 00:26:16.157]  You know, I probably ain't the only one that's seen it, but I figured I'd tell you it might look good in a future movie of yours.
[00:26:16.677 --> 00:26:19.918]  Well, I can't put somebody else's thing in there unless it's about me.
[00:26:21.798 --> 00:26:27.379]  It was on regular TV on Inside Edition, but it showed them getting in and out of that casket, and that's a big casket.
[00:26:27.839 --> 00:26:31.100]  I was shocked, and they had their face painted up like hockey pants.
[00:26:32.802 --> 00:26:35.665]  Well, I'm sure what you were seeing was a dramatization.
[00:26:36.506 --> 00:26:38.668]  Yeah, well, they said it was some of the only footage of it.
[00:26:39.769 --> 00:26:40.730]  I got it on tape.
[00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:42.652]  It's auto if you want to hear it.
[00:26:42.832 --> 00:26:44.634]  Oh, can you mail me that videotape?
[00:26:44.994 --> 00:26:45.895]  No, it's on auto.
[00:26:45.935 --> 00:26:46.696]  I ain't got no VCR.
[00:26:49.116 --> 00:27:00.619]  Well, you see, what's happening is people are getting the TV, the TiVo systems, or the cable boxes that record like 100 hours, and then people are getting rid of their VCRs, and they don't have a way to share the material.
[00:27:00.979 --> 00:27:08.341]  You should get a VCR, plug it in, and that way you can then not lose key stuff like that.
[00:27:08.866 --> 00:27:11.067]  Yeah, well, I just took the old Samson shortwave.
[00:27:11.127 --> 00:27:12.387]  It's got a tape deck on it.
[00:27:12.407 --> 00:27:14.308]  I stuck it down there and got it on audio.
[00:27:14.428 --> 00:27:16.369]  Oh, you're saying you've got audio.
[00:27:16.569 --> 00:27:19.090]  Yeah, I just stuck the shortwave tape deck down there.
[00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:21.891]  Just so you know, sir, they were saying some of the only footage.
[00:27:22.331 --> 00:27:24.232]  Was this night vision footage outside?
[00:27:24.252 --> 00:27:25.893]  Yeah, it was night vision.
[00:27:26.353 --> 00:27:28.914]  They said that in the inside edition part.
[00:27:29.294 --> 00:27:31.115]  No, I've got that footage.
[00:27:31.195 --> 00:27:32.375]  I thought you meant some new footage.
[00:27:32.495 --> 00:27:33.456]  Yeah, it showed a little 3-2-2, but...
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.641]  They couldn't lose because they're both Kerry and Bush.
[00:27:37.661 --> 00:27:40.122]  You know, it's either way, it's a winning deal for them.
[00:27:40.162 --> 00:27:42.323]  So, it's just right out in your face.
[00:27:42.383 --> 00:27:45.885]  It's like last week with them showing the little chips in the syringe on there.
[00:27:46.745 --> 00:27:48.546]  I guess they just keep on going with it.
[00:27:48.666 --> 00:27:53.428]  You know, if people don't start getting wise to this, a lot of good people is going to go down with them.
[00:27:53.448 --> 00:27:55.129]  But, oh well.
[00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:58.250]  It's amazing.
[00:27:58.571 --> 00:27:59.131]  So, they're...
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:07.284]  I mean, the last two weeks, they say the Bilderberg Group basically chose John Edwards as the VP and told Kerry.
[00:28:07.624 --> 00:28:13.347]  Then a caller said that Kerry was on with Larry King live and basically said that I didn't see it.
[00:28:13.728 --> 00:28:17.990]  I got actually a bunch of calls off air about it and some emails, not just a call on air.
[00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:21.712]  Well, Kerry keeps saying he wants to work on the war on terror at home.
[00:28:21.792 --> 00:28:23.453]  I guess that's putting us under the U.N.
[00:28:23.493 --> 00:28:24.794]  and strapping us down like that.
[00:28:25.353 --> 00:28:26.474]  Well, that's it.
[00:28:26.614 --> 00:28:29.717]  I mean, the left is going to love the Patriot Act as soon as Kerry's in.
[00:28:30.378 --> 00:28:33.861]  They're going to love everything Bush has helped set up, if Kerry does indeed get in.
[00:28:34.201 --> 00:28:39.026]  Kerry wants to double the CIA and put it here domestically, which Bush actually wants, too.
[00:28:39.106 --> 00:28:43.870]  So there is actually no difference in their actions, only in their rhetoric.
[00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:46.973]  And now their rhetoric is becoming near identical.
[00:28:47.073 --> 00:28:47.794]  I'd say about 90% the same.
[00:28:49.737 --> 00:28:53.882]  And if you think John Edwards is so good, just look at North Carolina.
[00:28:53.902 --> 00:29:05.494]  When he was on there getting interviewed by one of the main three stations, I think it was either Jennings or Rather, he said that he was the Freemason of lawyers, and he acted like he had to kind of check him up on that where his mouth got a little bit out of hand.
[00:29:05.534 --> 00:29:08.737]  But anyway, if you think he's so good, just look at us.
[00:29:10.239 --> 00:29:11.100]  That's all I had, though.
[00:29:11.795 --> 00:29:12.756]  Good to hear from you.
[00:29:13.197 --> 00:29:16.660]  Yeah, I'm getting reports that all over TV there's Skull & Bones specials.
[00:29:17.301 --> 00:29:20.384]  All over they're talking about Bilderberg Group.
[00:29:20.524 --> 00:29:23.768]  A 14-page article about Bohemian Grove and the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:29:24.849 --> 00:29:27.091]  Oh, here they are in some hoods just having fun.
[00:29:27.131 --> 00:29:28.032]  It's no big deal.
[00:29:28.653 --> 00:29:32.917]  You know, your leaders wear hoods and meet in secret and worship a big owl.
[00:29:33.037 --> 00:29:34.279]  I mean, it's just normal.
[00:29:35.952 --> 00:29:43.116]  Let us put microchips in you and track everything you do and not let you protest and build lots of prisons and put the police in black ski masks.
[00:29:44.517 --> 00:29:47.298]  I mean, they have to match their master ceremonial outfits.
[00:29:47.338 --> 00:29:48.819]  The good guys cover their faces.
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:52.481]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.981 --> 00:29:54.582]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.502 --> 00:29:58.184]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.331 --> 00:30:07.655]  Just once, I'd like to clean my car's leather upholstery without sliding across the seat on every turn.
[00:30:08.335 --> 00:30:12.739]  Just once, I'd like to get a beautiful shine without a slick, oily residue that attracts dust and dirt.

[00:32:01.923 --> 00:32:06.324]  Stop paying over $2 an ounce for fresh wheatgrass juice at your local juice bar.

[00:32:55.523 --> 00:33:13.706]  They're held against the crown Another ragtag man Declaring independence Take their bodies down
[00:33:27.027 --> 00:33:32.352]  Thanks to the renegades, my friends.
[00:33:33.694 --> 00:33:35.635]  Thank God for the renegades.
[00:33:37.037 --> 00:33:38.518]  All right, my friends, it is Tuesday.
[00:33:38.558 --> 00:33:38.698]  We're 30...
[00:33:53.246 --> 00:34:06.149]  Three, well, almost 34 minutes into this first hour, we've got Robert Galen Ross coming up with Paul Joseph Watson together in the next hour, kind of a roundtable discussion.
[00:34:06.169 --> 00:34:09.389]  I'm about to go to Regina and Lee and others that are holding.
[00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:11.050]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:13.810]  But really what happened is, and it's a double-edged sword,
[00:34:22.432 --> 00:34:40.968]  Twenty years ago, ten years ago, eight, nine years ago, patriots, freedom lovers, mainly what you'd call ultra-right-wing conservatives, a cadre of millions of people learned of the New World Order RFID tracker chip and plannable chip plan.
[00:34:41.728 --> 00:34:45.932]  People inside government leaked us this information and it got declassified.
[00:34:46.798 --> 00:34:49.900]  We warned the world about all the urban warfare training drills.
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:52.281]  We warned the world about all the prisons that were being built.
[00:34:52.662 --> 00:34:54.222]  The plans to invade the planet.
[00:34:57.104 --> 00:34:57.925]  And we were the cooks.
[00:34:57.965 --> 00:34:58.585]  We were the nuts.
[00:34:58.625 --> 00:34:59.406]  We were the weirdos.
[00:35:00.566 --> 00:35:01.467]  It didn't exist.
[00:35:01.567 --> 00:35:02.527]  Ha ha ha.
[00:35:03.048 --> 00:35:05.369]  Can I have some cheese on that Bilderberger?
[00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:08.851]  Oh, what's the CFR?
[00:35:09.071 --> 00:35:10.572]  Oh, more imaginary groups.
[00:35:11.533 --> 00:35:15.315]  And strangely enough, a lot of so-called conservative leaders like Rush Limbaugh
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:22.263]  We're the most ardent attackers of anyone that believed in a new world order.
[00:35:22.443 --> 00:35:30.067]  As presidents gave speeches about it, and prime ministers called for it, and premiers promoted it in world taxation.
[00:35:34.031 --> 00:35:43.198]  And so that was my wake-up call eight, nine, ten years ago when certainly I thought it was all the evil liberals, why they're the scourge, the vanguard of the New World Order.
[00:35:43.218 --> 00:35:57.788]  But then I noticed that Republican leaders actually get more done than even Democrats do because they're able, as wolves in sheep's clothing or as Trojan horses, to sneak past and get the agenda into place.
[00:36:00.631 --> 00:36:01.011]  And so...
[00:36:02.515 --> 00:36:03.255]  Something happened.
[00:36:03.295 --> 00:36:04.336]  We warned the world.
[00:36:04.396 --> 00:36:06.557]  We talked about it, whatever label you wanted to put on us.
[00:36:06.677 --> 00:36:13.860]  And now the grassroots left wing began to listen to us five years ago or so, even before Clinton left office.
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:20.142]  They were waking up to Bill Clinton and the New World Order because we would expose Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
[00:36:20.182 --> 00:36:21.743]  Then they didn't see us as hypocritical.
[00:36:22.243 --> 00:36:24.624]  Then they would look at the evidence we were bringing forward.
[00:36:24.864 --> 00:36:30.907]  We got past the false left-right polarization of that paradigm, and we were really getting stuff done.
[00:36:32.991 --> 00:36:41.436]  Now the controlled left, the controlled opposition, has co-opted a lot of the anti-New World Order globalization movement.
[00:36:42.817 --> 00:36:48.960]  And their answer is, oh, we need to have a loving UN world government instead of the evil right-wing government of George Bush.
[00:36:50.681 --> 00:36:59.606]  When really there's no difference in the government styles, in what they're doing, just as I said, some of their speeches, some of their words are different.
[00:37:00.727 --> 00:37:01.427]  Their rhetoric.
[00:37:04.401 --> 00:37:12.489]  And so, we were coops to talk about it, because they were setting up this New World Order, now that it's here.
[00:37:12.649 --> 00:37:13.810]  Oh, the New World Order is here.
[00:37:14.711 --> 00:37:17.273]  Not coming, not almost here, we're now inside of it.
[00:37:18.734 --> 00:37:26.782]  And now it's just going to intensify and launch even greater assaults at an exponential rate.
[00:37:29.492 --> 00:37:43.696]  Now that the New World Order is out in the open and being admitted, you have the neocon yuppie group that sees themselves as all-powerful and part of the power system, hailing world government, saying it's conservative, saying it's great, saying we're in a war.
[00:37:46.856 --> 00:37:51.037]  The same people that said the plan to put chips in us doesn't exist, you're a crazy kook.
[00:37:51.337 --> 00:37:53.398]  Now we're saying, hey, it's a good idea, it'll keep us safe.
[00:37:56.175 --> 00:38:07.978]  And then you've got the left out there, the grassroots left, thinking that John Kerry and the New World Order from the leftward side of things are going to save them when there are only two wings on the same bird.
[00:38:09.738 --> 00:38:11.179]  Two sides of the same coin.
[00:38:12.799 --> 00:38:14.099]  Apples from the same tree.
[00:38:14.179 --> 00:38:18.400]  I mean, you can left and right eye.
[00:38:20.021 --> 00:38:21.581]  The examples go on and on.
[00:38:24.625 --> 00:38:38.052]  And so, everybody was in denial about this stuff, and on one side of the equation, we warned people, we laid it out, we went over the facts, and now it's come true, just as we said it would, unfortunately.
[00:38:40.933 --> 00:38:50.318]  And so, those of us that were telling the truth and exposing the New World Order have gained a massive measure of credibility, because we laid out the blueprint and what was going to happen.
[00:38:51.869 --> 00:39:00.274]  In many cases, decades before, I mean, if you read Gary Allen's Dunder Call a Conspiracy written in 72, it's like the guy had a crystal ball looking at 2004.
[00:39:00.755 --> 00:39:07.419]  And so we gained a lot of credibility.
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:16.925]  But the globalists are countering that by just coming out and going, yeah, we're going to put chips in all of you, we're going to arrest whoever we want secretly, we're going to ban protests.
[00:39:17.952 --> 00:39:20.373]  We're going to forcibly inoculate you.
[00:39:20.493 --> 00:39:22.313]  We are going to do this and that.
[00:39:23.734 --> 00:39:29.936]  And they just smile up there with their makeup on and their fancy suits and the info babes licking their lips.
[00:39:30.976 --> 00:39:34.677]  And they've given an offer to the American people.
[00:39:35.497 --> 00:39:41.199]  Psychologically, they're coming out with it to scare us at one level, but also basically saying, hey, just join us.
[00:39:42.239 --> 00:39:43.380]  Hey, be on the winning team.
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.761]  Hey, it's a good thing what we're doing.
[00:39:45.061 --> 00:39:46.742]  Go ahead and just decide to go along with us.
[00:39:47.142 --> 00:39:48.583]  Go ahead and decide to accept it.
[00:39:48.603 --> 00:39:54.787]  Just go ahead and decide, or even better yet, just fall out of society.
[00:39:55.948 --> 00:40:01.772]  Just watch your television and don't talk to your neighbors and just make your money and go on your vacations and just drop out.
[00:40:02.012 --> 00:40:03.093]  Just let us run things.
[00:40:05.563 --> 00:40:07.204]  I mean, they love it when people don't vote.
[00:40:07.244 --> 00:40:11.765]  They love it when 70 plus percent of people on average don't vote in most elections.
[00:40:11.825 --> 00:40:14.046]  It's about half vote in major national elections.
[00:40:15.427 --> 00:40:17.468]  Which are the elections that are staged that don't matter?
[00:40:17.508 --> 00:40:22.009]  It's that local election, or in some cases, what, 8% of people vote here in Austin or something?
[00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:25.631]  Those are the elections where we really could make a change.
[00:40:26.891 --> 00:40:28.472]  Where they don't have all their people in place.
[00:40:29.192 --> 00:40:31.733]  But now they're putting in the electronic voting machines so they do.
[00:40:33.237 --> 00:40:33.577]  I don't know.
[00:40:33.637 --> 00:40:35.558]  I mean, I want to go to your calls and cover news.
[00:40:35.658 --> 00:40:54.645]  I just really cannot state to you, properly, that I am even amazed that I struggle for words to describe just how calculated and cunning and sadistic this system is.
[00:40:54.765 --> 00:40:58.346]  And it's the social planners, it's the social architects,
[00:40:59.512 --> 00:41:00.573]  They write the handbooks.
[00:41:00.633 --> 00:41:03.814]  It's all public what they're going to do to us, and they're implementing it.
[00:41:04.774 --> 00:41:12.197]  And people think I have a crystal ball just because I read their own white papers until late into the wee hours of the morning.
[00:41:13.618 --> 00:41:22.021]  And we're going to have to sit here and watch our country torn limb from limb, every freedom degraded, secret arrest, exploding, forced drugging.
[00:41:23.788 --> 00:41:32.435]  Every form of evil you can imagine, and it's all going to be good with a good-looking info babe licking her lips telling you how great it is.
[00:41:34.017 --> 00:41:41.123]  And for a society that's fad-driven, who deep down are afraid, a lot of people are going to make the decision to join it.
[00:41:41.183 --> 00:41:47.869]  They're just going to make that subconscious decision that this is too scary and too out of control, and I'm going to go get my chip.
[00:41:49.162 --> 00:41:53.603]  I'm going to go kneel to this system, and I'm going to call you a kook when you don't take it.
[00:41:54.983 --> 00:42:08.586]  And first it's going to be your children running out to get it, because it's going to be the fad, it's going to be the cool thing to do that all the squares are against, and simultaneously it's going to be the military and law enforcement and government officials.
[00:42:10.046 --> 00:42:18.688]  I told you months ago that within two maximum of three years, public officials, officials, our authorities, our masters, not our servants,
[00:42:19.949 --> 00:42:21.610]  We'll be getting the chips, en masse.
[00:42:23.031 --> 00:42:25.973]  I told you that within two years, the military is going to have it.
[00:42:27.374 --> 00:42:30.056]  And then the young people are going to start taking it within two years.
[00:42:30.356 --> 00:42:30.796]  Two or three.
[00:42:31.997 --> 00:42:39.682]  And right on time last week, the Justice Department in Mexico, the Attorney General, now they're saying they may make the Mexican police take it.
[00:42:40.302 --> 00:42:43.884]  And don't think for a minute that they want to lose their authority, their little petty authority.
[00:42:44.425 --> 00:42:49.388]  And so they'll do whatever it's told to keep that magic uniform that is God in Latin America.
[00:42:50.549 --> 00:42:51.530]  About to be God here.
[00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:53.171]  We'll learn to serve it, learn to worship it.
[00:42:54.612 --> 00:42:56.594]  And so it's going to happen.
[00:42:58.055 --> 00:43:07.744]  And then the government's going to start blowing up buildings and killing people and blaming it on some shadowy Christian terror group that is against the microchip.
[00:43:07.804 --> 00:43:12.207]  And then they're going to arrest anybody that criticizes it, saying that we're secretly members of the terror group.
[00:43:13.608 --> 00:43:17.111]  And they'll probably use this evidence against me that I'm exposing the federal plan now.
[00:43:17.131 --> 00:43:18.252]  They'll say, how did Jones know this?
[00:43:18.272 --> 00:43:18.933]  He must be one of them.
[00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:27.752]  And they're going to take your children from you, and they're going to put chips in them, and they're going to put them on antipsychotics, and they're going to put you in giant FEMA camps, and it's going to be on the news.
[00:43:27.772 --> 00:43:28.432]  It's not going to be hidden.
[00:43:29.192 --> 00:43:33.133]  And the Christian news channels are going to say that you're really devil worshipers and deserve it, and you're going to love it.
[00:43:36.294 --> 00:43:42.696]  And as the fare increases, more people are going to join the system, thinking that by serving it, they get power, and that it protects them.
[00:43:45.136 --> 00:43:47.437]  Now, that's what's going to happen.
[00:43:48.709 --> 00:43:56.851]  Going to happen unless every single one of us gets as involved and active.
[00:43:57.292 --> 00:44:00.152]  Oh, by the way, once you go to the camp, you're going to be forced to take the chip.
[00:44:02.313 --> 00:44:02.813]  Oh, yes.
[00:44:04.994 --> 00:44:05.434]  Oh, yes.
[00:44:09.275 --> 00:44:16.077]  What we can do to stop this is to speak out and to expose this and to get in people's faces and get past their comfort zones.
[00:44:16.969 --> 00:44:24.374]  The other day on talk radio, I was on a local talk show yesterday morning for three hours.
[00:44:25.955 --> 00:44:27.876]  And it's a show that made fun of me years ago.
[00:44:27.896 --> 00:44:30.658]  I mean, really made fun of me aggressively.
[00:44:32.219 --> 00:44:41.885]  But, you know, I appreciate the fact that the host, the main host, number one talk show in the morning in town, got up at a large meeting
[00:44:43.359 --> 00:44:45.921]  A few months ago and said, you know, I was wrong about Alex Jones.
[00:44:46.681 --> 00:44:48.323]  What he says is really backed up with facts.
[00:44:48.383 --> 00:44:48.943]  I checked it out.
[00:44:49.643 --> 00:44:52.145]  But there I was on the morning show, and I would challenge him.
[00:44:52.165 --> 00:44:53.986]  They couldn't believe some of it, but they couldn't believe all of it.
[00:44:54.027 --> 00:45:01.592]  And I'd go, okay, in the New York subway in 1968, they had light bulbs that released biological weapons that time-released and killed a bunch of people.
[00:45:01.632 --> 00:45:03.013]  The details remain classified.
[00:45:03.653 --> 00:45:07.936]  They'd type that in, and he'd go, my gosh, MSNBC says it killed people on purpose.
[00:45:08.697 --> 00:45:11.239]  And I'd say, okay, they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[00:45:11.279 --> 00:45:11.959]  I'd give them a keyword.
[00:45:11.999 --> 00:45:13.080]  They'd type it in, and it'd pop up.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:20.085]  I'd say, okay, the troops are breathing hundreds of times the safe levels of depleted uranium.
[00:45:20.165 --> 00:45:21.226]  It's killing them.
[00:45:21.747 --> 00:45:25.590]  The top scientist has gone public with it, and they wouldn't believe it, and they'd type it in, and it'd pop up.
[00:45:26.350 --> 00:45:27.811]  And, you know, I just did that for hours.
[00:45:28.872 --> 00:45:32.275]  Just horror after horror after horror after horror.
[00:45:34.177 --> 00:45:38.060]  But today they were right back to their normal format, because that's the format.
[00:45:39.151 --> 00:45:43.292]  They have me on once a month or something, but all these other shows have me on.
[00:45:43.332 --> 00:45:45.873]  I mean, I've been on hundreds of these morning talk shows around the country.
[00:45:46.593 --> 00:45:56.895]  But after they're done hearing me talk and people know it's true and check it out, still, it doesn't take on that conscious, front-of-the-brain focus.
[00:45:59.115 --> 00:46:01.456]  They don't idolize the truth.
[00:46:03.022 --> 00:46:04.503]  Idolatry is what you worship.
[00:46:04.543 --> 00:46:05.404]  It's what you love.
[00:46:05.424 --> 00:46:10.447]  If you love sports more than your family, then you're an idolater.
[00:46:10.707 --> 00:46:13.608]  So people out there, they idolize Britney Spears.
[00:46:13.648 --> 00:46:15.930]  They idolize Jennifer Aniston.
[00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:17.390]  They idolize Brad Pitt.
[00:46:17.911 --> 00:46:20.492]  They idolize looking cool at the grocery store.
[00:46:21.032 --> 00:46:21.713]  Above!
[00:46:21.733 --> 00:46:30.898]  It's not bad to look good or look cool or whatever or enjoy entertainment, but when you put it above your family and your freedom and your future...
[00:46:31.721 --> 00:46:32.361]  You're foolish.
[00:46:33.802 --> 00:46:36.763]  And so people have taken the step of knowing this is true.
[00:46:37.183 --> 00:46:43.745]  Again, as I've said, over 1,600 radio interviews, maybe one caller out of 30 disagrees with me.
[00:46:46.986 --> 00:46:49.267]  You've heard me as a guest on your local talk station, I would guess.
[00:46:54.089 --> 00:46:56.530]  But I don't know.
[00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:59.991]  It's just absolutely amazing.
[00:47:01.749 --> 00:47:02.850]  The things that are happening.
[00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:06.252]  And so, we've got to go all the way.
[00:47:06.412 --> 00:47:08.353]  Not just, oh yeah, Alex is right.
[00:47:08.413 --> 00:47:10.114]  Man, it sounds crazy, but I checked it out.
[00:47:10.534 --> 00:47:25.083]  But, wow, I'm a cop and I serve a government that puts cancer viruses in my vaccines, that puts fluoride in my water and my children's water, that sprays chemicals and radiologicals on me.
[00:47:26.104 --> 00:47:27.445]  Thousands have admitted tests on you.
[00:47:29.206 --> 00:47:29.466]  That...
[00:47:31.877 --> 00:47:33.258]  You know, that does all these things.
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:38.563]  You know, I serve a government that's been caught shipping in narcotics hundreds of times.
[00:47:39.624 --> 00:47:42.266]  We're talking bus loads, boat loads, plane loads.
[00:47:44.128 --> 00:47:48.251]  You know, I serve a government that lies perpetually.
[00:47:49.172 --> 00:47:55.277]  I serve a government where the drug dealers, the big kingpins, don't just bring in the drugs, but they own the prisons.
[00:47:55.697 --> 00:47:59.681]  And then I bust young kids on the streets with pot and send them to prison.
[00:48:00.345 --> 00:48:03.107]  To work in a private prison owned by the drug dealers?
[00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:11.253]  Well, I know a lot of bad stuff's going on, but I just can't believe that about America.
[00:48:11.834 --> 00:48:13.415]  Stop being so naive.
[00:48:14.276 --> 00:48:15.416]  Stop being so stupid.
[00:48:17.578 --> 00:48:18.879]  Stop denying what's going on.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.382]  I mean, I was the kook of the world saying that the U.N.
[00:48:22.762 --> 00:48:23.903]  runs our Supreme Court.
[00:48:23.983 --> 00:48:25.124]  I just read their rulings.
[00:48:25.754 --> 00:48:26.074]  I think?
[00:48:26.094 --> 00:48:26.375]  I think?
[00:48:54.807 --> 00:48:56.549]  I mean, face it, here's another analogy.
[00:48:57.109 --> 00:49:01.112]  If an evil race of space aliens, and I'm not saying this is real, it's an analogy.
[00:49:01.673 --> 00:49:14.223]  If an evil race of space aliens landed tomorrow and should kneel before us and be our slaves and we're going to kill you, I'd say about 90% of people would hit their knees and start licking the aliens' boots.
[00:49:16.906 --> 00:49:22.991]  If Hitler would have taken over and won in Europe and come to America and taken over our government...
[00:49:24.412 --> 00:49:32.476]  People who were ready and willing to fight him, if the government suddenly and the radio suddenly said serve him, they would suddenly worship Hitler.
[00:49:33.017 --> 00:49:34.117]  You think I'm joking?
[00:49:35.618 --> 00:49:36.679]  So let's just face it.
[00:49:36.739 --> 00:49:43.863]  Most people will, if they're ordered to, act just like the Nazis and line little kids up and blow their heads off.
[00:49:45.884 --> 00:49:49.666]  I mean, yesterday we had a bronze star, highly decorated, multi-tourer,
[00:49:52.156 --> 00:50:00.743]  Veteran of Vietnam, a sniper, Army sniper, high-level DEA agent, openly telling you about our government eyewitness shipping in most of the cocaine.
[00:50:04.606 --> 00:50:06.367]  Eyewitness to Oliver North, all of it.
[00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:11.811]  I mean, if you won't listen to him, how many others?
[00:50:12.231 --> 00:50:15.274]  CIA and FBI and DEA agents who I had on.
[00:50:15.534 --> 00:50:17.675]  Quite a few over the years telling you the exact same thing.
[00:50:17.856 --> 00:50:20.878]  People who unloaded the cocaine from airplanes at MENA.
[00:50:21.903 --> 00:50:23.663]  And nobody's held accountable and nothing happens.
[00:50:23.944 --> 00:50:30.865]  That should concern you that the corruption is so bad that everybody knows these people are criminals but nothing happens to them.
[00:50:31.045 --> 00:50:33.666]  Because see, tyranny doesn't operate in a vacuum.
[00:50:33.726 --> 00:50:34.586]  It's not going to stop.
[00:50:34.646 --> 00:50:37.207]  It's going to keep going until we say no to it.
[00:50:37.227 --> 00:50:46.189]  Alright, we'll come back and go to Regina and Lee and others and get to a bunch of news.
[00:50:48.209 --> 00:50:50.230]  But you're going to be in hell on earth
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:52.561]  Very soon, folks.
[00:50:52.781 --> 00:50:54.122]  You're inside the New World Order right now.
[00:50:54.803 --> 00:50:55.684]  You don't want to go any deeper.
[00:50:56.004 --> 00:50:56.764]  You want to get out of it.
[00:50:56.784 --> 00:50:57.125]  Quickly.
[00:51:01.588 --> 00:51:05.932]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.112 --> 00:51:10.595]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.695 --> 00:51:11.496]  There is a chance.
[00:51:13.117 --> 00:51:15.079]  This disaster is a new world order.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:18.023]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:51:18.243 --> 00:51:22.469]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.529 --> 00:51:29.457]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.597 --> 00:51:31.600]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:42.406]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.586 --> 00:51:47.970]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:51.111]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:51:51.211 --> 00:51:51.852]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:51:52.232 --> 00:51:53.533]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:52:01.249 --> 00:52:01.869]  Hello, folks.
[00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:02.870]  Alex Jones here.
[00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:07.113]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:52:07.253 --> 00:52:10.115]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:52:10.215 --> 00:52:16.940]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:20.122]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:52:20.322 --> 00:52:22.724]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:52:22.844 --> 00:52:27.567]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove...
[00:52:27.887 --> 00:52:28.127]  I think?
[00:52:52.333 --> 00:52:52.493]  803-4438.
[00:52:52.533 --> 00:52:53.894]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:52:54.034 --> 00:52:59.077]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.

[00:54:07.641 --> 00:54:10.422]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:10.802 --> 00:54:14.304]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:54:14.324 --> 00:54:18.825]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:54:19.366 --> 00:54:25.428]  All right, if you want to learn about the incredible microchip RFID technology, what the New World Order is...
[00:54:26.812 --> 00:54:28.272]  The police state they're setting up.

[00:54:36.814 --> 00:54:43.536]  Two great new videos we put out that cover a wide range of issues, kind of the shotgun effect of giving people the big picture.
[00:54:44.196 --> 00:54:48.537]  There's also my two 9-11 films, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny on VHS and DVD.
[00:54:48.997 --> 00:54:51.278]  The Masters of Terror is part two of that film.
[00:54:51.318 --> 00:54:52.198]  It's excellent as well.
[00:54:52.218 --> 00:54:54.439]  I also carry George Humphrey's new video, 9-11.
[00:54:56.067 --> 00:54:59.069]  The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati.
[00:54:59.109 --> 00:54:59.429]  It's only $19.95.
[00:54:59.589 --> 00:55:04.572]  Get a free color, 80-plus page booklet with it when you get it.
[00:55:04.612 --> 00:55:05.953]  Get a second copy for $14.95.
[00:55:06.494 --> 00:55:11.897]  So that's $34.95 for two copies of the film, George Tom Cruise, and three of the color booklets.
[00:55:13.198 --> 00:55:16.620]  And my films are $25.95 apiece, all over two hours.
[00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:19.802]  I mean, Police State, Three Total Enslavement is two hours, 44 minutes.
[00:55:19.902 --> 00:55:22.204]  It's the equivalent of three or four films in one.
[00:55:23.121 --> 00:55:26.903]  Mine are $25.95 apiece, but order three or more of any of the ten films I've made.
[00:55:27.223 --> 00:55:28.883]  They drop down to $20 apiece.
[00:55:29.624 --> 00:55:34.065]  Operators are standing by to answer your questions or take your order, or both, at 1-888-253-3139.
[00:55:34.085 --> 00:55:40.468]  Any questions about the films or different discounts on the books or other materials we have?
[00:55:40.488 --> 00:55:40.548]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:55:51.312 --> 00:55:59.276]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:56:00.036 --> 00:56:11.202]  And again, that toll-free number, 1-888-253-3139, or prisonplanet.com or infowars.com to order via our safe, secure shopping cart.
[00:56:11.962 --> 00:56:14.043]  All right, let's go ahead now and go to the calls.
[00:56:15.024 --> 00:56:16.925]  Let's talk to Regina in Pennsylvania.
[00:56:16.965 --> 00:56:17.726]  Regina, go ahead.
[00:56:17.746 --> 00:56:18.666]  Hi, Alex.
[00:56:18.927 --> 00:56:19.347]  Hello.
[00:56:19.567 --> 00:56:21.028]  I didn't know if you covered this.
[00:56:21.788 --> 00:56:31.534]  This couple, they're from Texas by the name of Jeff and Nicole Rank, that they were in West Virginia doing some work under FEMA.
[00:56:31.554 --> 00:56:37.658]  You said that, you know, it'll come a point or maybe people will wake up when it comes to the point.
[00:56:37.678 --> 00:56:41.300]  And they were wearing T-shirts that they didn't like Bush, so they were arrested.
[00:56:41.741 --> 00:56:41.981]  Right.
[00:56:42.561 --> 00:56:43.762]  And then she was fired.
[00:56:44.335 --> 00:56:48.479]  Well, it says that she was released from the job, not necessarily fired.
[00:56:49.821 --> 00:56:51.362]  The latest info is she was fired.
[00:56:51.382 --> 00:56:52.303]  That's from last week.
[00:56:53.004 --> 00:56:53.284]  Okay.
[00:56:54.586 --> 00:56:55.647]  It really doesn't matter.
[00:56:55.707 --> 00:57:01.593]  The point is that what I wanted up here in Pennsylvania, there's a couple things happening.
[00:57:01.613 --> 00:57:03.335]  If you give me just a couple minutes here.
[00:57:03.355 --> 00:57:04.756]  We didn't, but...
[00:57:07.799 --> 00:57:14.402]  Home Rule got passed in Allegheny County, and that's a county that's falling out from all other counties in Pennsylvania.
[00:57:14.442 --> 00:57:15.662]  Give us money, we're broke.
[00:57:16.443 --> 00:57:22.425]  And it reminded me, when I read this article about this rank couple, that they have an ordinance.
[00:57:23.245 --> 00:57:26.747]  I haven't been able to check whether this was passed or not.
[00:57:28.207 --> 00:57:31.329]  I'm sure you know about Home Rule from Ed Belladonna.
[00:57:31.349 --> 00:57:33.249]  Well, I bet you 90% of our listeners don't.
[00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:36.891]  Okay, well, the constitutional limits...
[00:57:37.406 --> 00:57:41.449]  Yeah, it's the city saying you don't have a right to own guns or you don't have a right to protest.
[00:57:41.909 --> 00:57:43.430]  Constitutional, right.
[00:57:43.450 --> 00:57:48.073]  But what the outcome is at this point is they're ready to pass an ordinance.
[00:58:01.683 --> 00:58:03.524]  They were on June 17th.
[00:58:03.584 --> 00:58:08.145]  I haven't been able to follow the... If this really got passed or what... Okay, but you said that.
[00:58:08.165 --> 00:58:08.505]  Go ahead.
[00:58:08.665 --> 00:58:08.966]  Okay.
[00:58:09.186 --> 00:58:12.127]  Bar county employees from engaging in political activities.
[00:58:12.187 --> 00:58:19.329]  Among the restrictions, employees would not be allowed to circulate petitions, raise money for candidates, or work polling places for political parties.
[00:58:19.769 --> 00:58:23.190]  They're going to be hired under merit pay, get rid of the elected offices.
[00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:24.971]  I'm sure you know that about home rules.
[00:58:25.211 --> 00:58:28.452]  But we're to the point, like this couple, that you're not even allowed...
[00:58:31.035 --> 00:58:34.537]  Well, it's like telling the New York cops, hey, you can't protest or you're fired.
[00:58:34.777 --> 00:58:35.538]  Right, exactly.
[00:58:35.778 --> 00:58:37.039]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[00:58:37.059 --> 00:58:39.121]  That's why our troops are fighting, so we don't have any rights.
[00:58:40.202 --> 00:58:41.002]  Can I say something?
[00:58:41.282 --> 00:58:41.523]  Sure.
[00:58:41.543 --> 00:58:48.588]  Okay, I just wanted to say that I don't know if you've been following the race up here with Arlen Specter, and we all know Arlen Specter.
[00:58:48.608 --> 00:58:49.829]  Well, there isn't any voting anymore.
[00:58:57.978 --> 00:58:58.619]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.279 --> 00:59:00.360]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:02.161]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.802 --> 00:59:03.642]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.383 --> 00:59:05.304]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.324 --> 00:59:09.647]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.147 --> 00:59:14.251]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.813 --> 00:59:21.696]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight, we're here, my friends.
[00:59:22.437 --> 00:59:24.999]  Now into the second hour of this global broadcast.
[00:59:26.542 --> 00:59:36.951]  To all of our affiliates from out in California to Rhode Island, from Texas to Colorado to New York, we're honored to have you on board.
[00:59:36.991 --> 00:59:44.517]  We also go out on the global shortwave during the day at 94.75 and, of course, at night at 32.10 from 9 to midnight.
[00:59:45.438 --> 00:59:46.259]  We had him on a week ago.
[00:59:46.279 --> 00:59:47.640]  I'm going to have him back on today.
[00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:52.284]  Robert Galen Ross, we didn't have time to cover everything, as well as Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:59:52.304 --> 00:59:53.725]  That's coming up later in this hour.
[00:59:55.057 --> 00:59:58.639]  And I've just got a ton of big brother police state Iraq news.
[00:59:58.659 --> 01:00:00.481]  They're getting us ready to attack Iran.
[01:00:00.501 --> 01:00:02.642]  It's just all coming up.
[01:00:02.742 --> 01:00:11.468]  But Regina brought up some good points about the police state being carried out by cities at their local level.
[01:00:12.148 --> 01:00:14.970]  And then she talked about Arlen Specter in the Senate race.
[01:00:17.011 --> 01:00:22.014]  And when I say we don't have votes anymore, in most areas of the country, really, it's been proven to be a fraud.
[01:00:22.034 --> 01:00:22.895]  There isn't an election.
[01:00:23.536 --> 01:00:46.884]  And if we just complain and go, boy, these electronic voting machines are a fraud, and their engineers have quit and said it, and the CIA runs it, why won't you let us look at what you're doing, and we want paper ballots, and we just have to say, no, we're boycotting any election because this whole thing's a fraud, and we're going to have a recall petition at local level with paper ballots to recall these machines.
[01:00:46.984 --> 01:00:48.005]  That's all you can do.
[01:00:48.065 --> 01:00:49.305]  That's all I'm getting behind.
[01:00:50.350 --> 01:00:53.492]  I'm not going to sit here and give credence to this false process.
[01:00:54.853 --> 01:00:56.695]  That's why government's so arrogant right now.
[01:00:56.735 --> 01:00:58.516]  That's why they're doing so many horrible things.
[01:00:58.896 --> 01:01:04.700]  That's why they're dancing around right now saying they're going to take all our freedoms because they think you can't get them out of office.
[01:01:07.923 --> 01:01:10.104]  And almost every big city manager's in on it.
[01:01:11.445 --> 01:01:12.886]  All your governors are in on it.
[01:01:14.167 --> 01:01:18.090]  All your big committee chairmen and above that are in on it at the federal level.
[01:01:18.130 --> 01:01:19.371]  And it's a sick joke, people.
[01:01:20.367 --> 01:01:21.188]  You want tyranny?
[01:01:21.268 --> 01:01:22.309]  You are in the middle of it.
[01:01:23.770 --> 01:01:25.531]  Let's talk to Lee in New Mexico.
[01:01:25.611 --> 01:01:26.252]  Lee, go ahead.
[01:01:27.252 --> 01:01:28.914]  Greetings in the name of Yahweh.
[01:01:29.674 --> 01:01:33.457]  Mr. Jones, let me tell you, as a black man, I'm so proud of you.
[01:01:33.557 --> 01:01:37.800]  I've been following you since I was in Southern Illinois, since 2001.
[01:01:39.222 --> 01:01:47.548]  At first, I was troubled with the information that you were putting on the radio, but I believed it, and I was afraid for you.
[01:01:47.967 --> 01:01:49.148]  But you want to know something?
[01:01:49.408 --> 01:01:52.030]  I believe in God, and you are one of God's saints.
[01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:54.652]  You're a man of Ephesians 6 as far as I'm concerned.
[01:01:55.572 --> 01:02:05.019]  Being a person in my mid-30s, I've been talking to the 20-somethings and the 30-somethings on these university campuses.
[01:02:05.079 --> 01:02:13.885]  Two years ago, I called you about those students over there at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, and they were getting worried about your website at that point.
[01:02:14.765 --> 01:02:22.391]  And there are a lot of people in the age group that are listening to you and monitoring you, and they're taking what you're saying to heart.
[01:02:23.772 --> 01:02:42.286]  And they were saying a few things back a couple years ago, as they're saying right here in Las Cruces, New Mexico, that maybe that you, Mr. Jim Mars, Steve Quayle, and this great gentleman up there at KOA in Denver at night, his name is Rick Barber,
[01:02:42.682 --> 01:02:43.683]  Yeah, Rex, good guy.
[01:02:43.823 --> 01:02:45.203]  Yeah, we hear you sometimes.
[01:02:45.223 --> 01:02:48.985]  We're listening to you, Mr. Jones, and again, we're proud of what you're doing.
[01:02:49.106 --> 01:02:49.946]  You're a U.S.
[01:02:50.006 --> 01:02:52.728]  constitutional patriot in our eyes.
[01:02:53.168 --> 01:03:08.356]  We were wondering if you could have a possible maybe like national or maybe even international type of telethon or say like a Liberty or Give Me Death convention where you can get all this great information out, take our U.S.
[01:03:08.416 --> 01:03:09.737]  Constitution and show...
[01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:10.991]  All of us.
[01:03:11.351 --> 01:03:13.873]  All these evil people are violating our rights.
[01:03:15.354 --> 01:03:19.558]  Well, unfortunately, sir, I don't have the money to do that.
[01:03:19.618 --> 01:03:22.220]  Number two, the networks wouldn't sell us the time.
[01:03:22.781 --> 01:03:30.588]  They won't even let MoveOn.org, that is, you know, nothing compared to what we do, in a leftward slant, have ads on TV.
[01:03:31.709 --> 01:03:34.011]  So it's that much control.
[01:03:34.557 --> 01:03:36.839]  Well, you're still number one in our book.
[01:03:36.859 --> 01:03:38.180]  You just keep doing what you're doing.
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.801]  We're listening, but we're getting your tapes.
[01:03:39.821 --> 01:03:40.621]  We're sending it out.
[01:03:40.681 --> 01:03:41.602]  We're doing what we can.
[01:03:42.122 --> 01:03:43.023]  Well, God bless you, Lee.
[01:03:43.083 --> 01:03:45.705]  It's good to know you're out there, and I'm glad you've been on board with us for three years.
[01:03:45.745 --> 01:03:46.185]  Take care.
[01:03:46.865 --> 01:03:49.667]  We'll come back with more calls, more news, and some guests.
[01:03:50.088 --> 01:03:51.949]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[01:03:51.969 --> 01:03:53.470]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:03:53.810 --> 01:03:56.232]  Two nuclear powers rattle sabers over a disputed area.
[01:03:56.612 --> 01:04:00.535]  Peace in the Middle East derailed again as another wave of suicide bombers destabilized the region.
[01:04:00.915 --> 01:04:02.176]  Here at home, and abroad, our own
[01:04:02.236 --> 01:04:02.837]  We're good to go.
[01:04:17.978 --> 01:04:26.748]  And for no small reason when you consider ease of operation features like over 40 station presets, both upper and lower sidebands, as well as ship-to-shore weather and aviation bands.
[01:04:26.928 --> 01:04:32.635]  The Grundig Yacht-Boy 400 PE is fully digital, comes with its own carrying case, external antenna, and a headset for private listening.
[01:04:32.935 --> 01:04:39.377]  Normally retailing for $249, the Grundig Yacht Boy 400 PE is now available from Cliff Scott Enterprises for only $149.95.
[01:04:39.417 --> 01:04:40.037]  Call toll-free 1-800-569-4340.
[01:04:40.057 --> 01:04:41.517]  That's 1-800-569-4340 or visit cliffscott.com.
[01:04:41.537 --> 01:04:44.358]  Tune in the world and stay in touch with Grundig Shortwave Radios and Cliff Scott Enterprises.
[01:04:52.532 --> 01:04:59.356]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:59.696 --> 01:05:01.057]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:05:01.257 --> 01:05:03.478]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:05:03.618 --> 01:05:05.699]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:05:05.959 --> 01:05:10.922]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:05:11.242 --> 01:05:15.284]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:05:15.524 --> 01:05:17.305]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:05:17.385 --> 01:05:28.030]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and planable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:30.091]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:05:30.291 --> 01:05:34.153]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[01:05:34.253 --> 01:05:35.814]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[01:05:35.834 --> 01:05:36.594]  That's 888-2533-139.

[01:05:46.605 --> 01:05:47.307]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[01:05:53.021 --> 01:05:57.524]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:05:57.865 --> 01:06:01.948]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:06:02.268 --> 01:06:02.808]  We listened.
[01:06:03.108 --> 01:06:08.112]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:06:08.372 --> 01:06:08.853]  We listened.
[01:06:09.233 --> 01:06:12.295]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:06:12.715 --> 01:06:13.236]  We listened.
[01:06:13.676 --> 01:06:14.196]  We're good to go.
[01:06:14.216 --> 01:06:14.456]  I think?
[01:06:41.915 --> 01:06:47.498]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:06:47.518 --> 01:06:50.420]  All right, folks, we're eight minutes and about 15 seconds into the second hour.
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:53.922]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[01:07:10.416 --> 01:07:17.178]  I'm not trying to sound negative or put a bad face on things, but, I mean, if you've got cancer, brain cancer, you've got brain cancer.
[01:07:17.218 --> 01:07:18.139]  You've got to admit it.
[01:07:18.199 --> 01:07:20.139]  You've got to try to treat it, if it's possible.
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:28.102]  And we can snatch victory from the jaws of defeat against this new world order, but it's going to take getting out of denial.
[01:07:29.995 --> 01:07:42.090]  And realizing that most of what we see on television and the media is either a twisting, a spinning, or a fabrication, or lying by omission, and that much of it is just nothing more than theater.
[01:07:45.575 --> 01:07:48.759]  There's so much I want to talk about, so much I want to go over here.
[01:07:50.248 --> 01:07:51.589]  We're good to go.
[01:07:51.669 --> 01:07:52.830]  We're good to go.
[01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:17.491]  It's a pleasure being with you again, Alex.
[01:08:43.334 --> 01:08:47.617]  I've got a bunch of news that I've got to go over, and I guess I'll just cover some of it and get your take on it.
[01:08:49.479 --> 01:08:54.443]  I think the average person has trouble getting their mind around evil.
[01:08:54.923 --> 01:09:06.672]  When we hear Bush now wants to attack Iran, claiming they have the weapons of mass destruction, I read articles about the Iraqi Prime Minister lining people up and saying, this is how I want it done, and blowing people's heads off.
[01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:13.713]  We have a new video on the website of a crowd of demonstrators being bombed by a U.S.
[01:09:13.813 --> 01:09:14.333]  airplane.
[01:09:14.353 --> 01:09:23.237]  I mean, this is the kind of stuff that we see, and then people think that they're immune to it, that it's not going to happen here.
[01:09:23.797 --> 01:09:26.338]  Robert, your response to what I just said.
[01:09:26.798 --> 01:09:30.720]  Well, it's worse than what you say.
[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:34.982]  Of course, you know how bad it is, but I just heard the news this morning that the
[01:09:35.817 --> 01:09:43.259]  That there's some like 105 children have been tortured in the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.
[01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:46.180]  Now that's just one of 32 camps.
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:46.980]  Yeah.
[01:09:48.641 --> 01:09:54.103]  And you've got some... Most of the people in the military are decent people.
[01:09:54.423 --> 01:09:59.584]  They're trying to do good for not only the United States but the world.
[01:10:01.045 --> 01:10:05.066]  You'll have people just like in our prisons here in the United States...
[01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:18.076]  The people in general that are guards in these prisons have sort of strange attitudes, and they enjoy mistreating people.
[01:10:18.997 --> 01:10:26.722]  Of course, a lot of the prisoners need some correction, but they don't need the harsh treatment they're given.
[01:10:26.802 --> 01:10:32.125]  Like these children over in Iraq, there's never an excuse for mistreating children.
[01:10:34.312 --> 01:10:35.413]  It blows my mind.
[01:10:35.453 --> 01:10:42.036]  I mean, they call it abuse or pressure when they admit that it's full-grown men raping little boys and girls.
[01:10:42.796 --> 01:10:44.517]  How in the world?
[01:10:45.817 --> 01:10:46.158]  How?
[01:10:46.178 --> 01:10:49.739]  I mean, I've got stronger words than that.
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:54.642]  How can they find people to do this?
[01:10:54.722 --> 01:10:56.522]  It's not even being debated, Robert.
[01:10:56.562 --> 01:10:59.684]  They're admitting it, and this was ordered by our government.
[01:11:00.385 --> 01:11:15.412]  And they admit, the Army's own report, that 70 to 90 percent of those that they are stopping at checkpoints are innocent families, depending on what checkpoint, randomly just grabbed and taken for torture.
[01:11:16.172 --> 01:11:19.094]  They torture children in front of their parents, Robert.
[01:11:19.974 --> 01:11:24.636]  The government admits this, and then no one's held accountable, Robert.
[01:11:25.036 --> 01:11:26.277]  Yeah, I know, and it...
[01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:37.919]  And, of course, the National Security Act of 1947 prevents the people that are primarily behind this from being prosecuted either civilly or criminally.
[01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:41.041]  And we need to change that.
[01:11:41.862 --> 01:11:44.164]  We just can't just keep saying, oh, well.
[01:11:45.665 --> 01:11:56.074]  Well, I had a former Army sniper from Vietnam, highly decorated, high-level DEA agent on yesterday, Silly Castile.
[01:11:57.177 --> 01:11:58.438]  And he was just naming names.
[01:11:58.478 --> 01:12:00.559]  He was there, the government shipping out the cocaine.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:13.108]  He talked about Necroponte, John D. Necroponte, who he likened to the Pale Horse, whether it was Vietnam with Project Phoenix or the Death Squads in Latin America.
[01:12:13.148 --> 01:12:14.769]  This is the new guy they're sending to Iraq.
[01:12:15.009 --> 01:12:17.010]  They're going to turn the heat up out there.
[01:12:17.471 --> 01:12:23.715]  Yeah, and the fellow you're talking about, Celia, is going to be the guest speaker at True Seekers tonight.
[01:12:24.635 --> 01:12:26.777]  So I'm looking forward to hearing what he's got to say.
[01:12:28.311 --> 01:12:29.312]  Well, I wish I could make it.
[01:12:29.332 --> 01:12:31.793]  I'm going to be live on TV here in Austin.
[01:12:32.533 --> 01:12:37.996]  But, I mean, again, we've got a lot of calls and a bunch of news and a lot you want to cover.
[01:12:38.076 --> 01:12:47.602]  I just, at a certain point, you know, they call it, oh, I think they call it the terror alert, you know, terror alert fatigue.
[01:12:47.622 --> 01:12:50.083]  You know, they know that we'll get worn out by this.
[01:12:50.944 --> 01:12:53.065]  And it just wears me out psychologically.
[01:12:53.875 --> 01:12:59.660]  Realizing the type of goons we're facing who feel completely self-righteous in what they're doing.
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:04.564]  I mean, most criminals believe, well, the lady deserved to be killed or raped.
[01:13:04.684 --> 01:13:05.444]  She's a bleeper.
[01:13:06.992 --> 01:13:08.834]  Or, you know, serial killers.
[01:13:08.894 --> 01:13:10.875]  Well, I killed her because she looked like my mother.
[01:13:11.296 --> 01:13:19.423]  You know, so the sicko guards and the CIA people, you know, deep down, they're just sickos, but they've got this government excuse to go out and do it.
[01:13:20.043 --> 01:13:21.584]  Can you speak to that psychology?
[01:13:22.145 --> 01:13:29.751]  Well, Alex, you and I can't understand that because we're Christians and we really can't think of it like that.
[01:13:30.131 --> 01:13:32.553]  But these people have no problem with that.
[01:13:32.593 --> 01:13:33.114]  They're just like
[01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:35.020]  You know what's funny?
[01:14:02.825 --> 01:14:13.311]  We have these former CIA people, some we can confirm, some we can't, who claimed decades ago the exact type of stuff that our government's done in Abu Ghraib.
[01:14:14.231 --> 01:14:24.617]  And I always had trouble believing it, but every time we see our government officials, they're doing this, they've got their minions doing this, that adds a lot of credibility to those reports.
[01:14:25.234 --> 01:14:30.256]  Yeah, it's just like when you see your video of Bohemian Grove.
[01:14:30.996 --> 01:14:33.997]  You tell people about that and they just can't believe it.
[01:14:34.017 --> 01:14:36.458]  But when you see the video, you can't deny it.
[01:14:36.558 --> 01:14:44.481]  And when you see the still photographs and the videos of what's going on over there in Iraq, you can't deny it.
[01:14:44.501 --> 01:14:45.301]  It's there.
[01:14:45.321 --> 01:14:53.944]  Even though we can't think in that light, that's not natural for us to think like that.
[01:14:55.263 --> 01:14:56.304]  They have no problem with that.
[01:14:57.304 --> 01:14:59.005]  Well, I've heard something even sicker.
[01:14:59.145 --> 01:15:05.888]  I've probably heard 15, 20 talk shows, local, national, saying it's good.
[01:15:06.028 --> 01:15:06.528]  So what?
[01:15:06.568 --> 01:15:07.209]  They're animals.
[01:15:07.269 --> 01:15:07.949]  They deserve it.
[01:15:08.589 --> 01:15:10.570]  I thought we were supposedly liberating these people.
[01:15:11.010 --> 01:15:12.011]  Yeah, you would think so.
[01:15:12.131 --> 01:15:15.112]  And, of course, children are innocent.
[01:15:15.552 --> 01:15:18.774]  There's never an excuse to mistreat a child.
[01:15:19.234 --> 01:15:21.455]  That's the lowest thing you can do.
[01:15:22.614 --> 01:15:28.459]  Well, you know, people out there who promoted torture before this all came out said that, well, we've got to do this to keep our troops safe.
[01:15:28.479 --> 01:15:31.001]  And I said, it's going to lead to horrible stuff.
[01:15:31.101 --> 01:15:32.883]  Once you start this, it doesn't stop.
[01:15:33.643 --> 01:15:34.904]  And they just couldn't get that.
[01:15:34.964 --> 01:15:35.665]  They just couldn't.
[01:15:35.725 --> 01:15:36.926]  I guess they hadn't read their history.
[01:15:37.426 --> 01:15:43.411]  I guess Joseph Biden on one of the committees said it best than anyone else.
[01:15:44.512 --> 01:15:49.676]  We need to stop this because what if our children are tortured?
[01:15:49.937 --> 01:15:51.418]  That's the reason we need to stop this.
[01:15:53.382 --> 01:15:57.283]  Well, I mean, what, 80% of our new police come out of the military?
[01:15:58.504 --> 01:16:01.785]  We're going to have these people pulling this over at checkpoints?
[01:16:02.665 --> 01:16:05.066]  This is who's going to pull our daughters and sons over?
[01:16:05.086 --> 01:16:17.751]  Yeah, I remember when Mike Hanson was sitting in his pickup and they actually broke out the window and jerked him out of his pickup for no reason.
[01:16:18.411 --> 01:16:20.912]  And that's the sort of thing that's going on over there in Iraq.
[01:16:23.689 --> 01:16:30.615]  Well, Bush vows to keep searching for Iran linked to September 11th, despite CIA skepticism.
[01:16:31.155 --> 01:16:32.656]  President George Bush says the U.S.
[01:16:32.716 --> 01:16:37.701]  is investigating whether Iran played any role in the September 11, 2001 terror attacks.
[01:16:38.581 --> 01:16:44.146]  As to direct connections, we're digging into facts to determine if there is one, Mr. Bush said on Monday.
[01:16:44.878 --> 01:16:53.500]  So now Bush is running around claiming we may need to attack Iran, and Israel says they may go ahead and attack them, maybe with nuclear weapons.
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:57.940]  What do you see that doing in a geopolitical situation?
[01:16:58.121 --> 01:17:11.103]  Well, a couple of members of the elite said several months ago that if Bush turns on Syria and Iran...
[01:17:11.966 --> 01:17:19.449]  And tries to attack them that the elite are going to come down on Bush because it will defeat their purpose.
[01:17:21.029 --> 01:17:35.395]  And I lived in Iran for two years, and these people, not only Iranians but the Arabs in the area, many of them, not all of them, but I observed a religious ceremony where
[01:17:36.175 --> 01:17:42.880]  There were something like 50 men marching down the street, sort of like a military unit.
[01:17:43.681 --> 01:17:57.671]  And there was a young boy in front with a drum, playing cadence, as all these men... And they had holes cut in their shirt, in their back, so that you could see the blood as they had maces in each hand.
[01:17:57.751 --> 01:18:03.895]  And they would swing these in unison and hit themselves in the back with something like barbed wire.
[01:18:04.156 --> 01:18:04.236]  And...
[01:18:05.775 --> 01:18:15.579]  And so we can't think like these people, and we don't know where they're coming from, but they think nothing about killing someone.
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:34.208]  They'll go to their heaven if they kill an infidel, and their life is so terrible that they're looking for an improvement in their life by going to heaven, and so they don't have no problem blowing themselves up or something like that.
[01:18:36.407 --> 01:18:42.853]  If you don't understand the people in that region, you really can't appreciate what's going on.
[01:18:43.874 --> 01:18:45.376]  Well, our government knows what's going on.
[01:18:45.396 --> 01:18:46.717]  They're trying to stir the pot.
[01:18:46.737 --> 01:18:47.578]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:47.598 --> 01:18:48.079]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.982 --> 01:18:56.343]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:18:56.603 --> 01:19:00.425]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:19:00.765 --> 01:19:01.566]  Read the labels.
[01:19:02.006 --> 01:19:06.148]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:19:06.348 --> 01:19:10.530]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:19:10.911 --> 01:19:15.793]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:19:16.173 --> 01:19:19.756]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:19:19.936 --> 01:19:25.280]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:28.302]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:19:28.582 --> 01:19:29.483]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:21:54.733 --> 01:21:55.714]  Spring has arrived.
[01:21:55.914 --> 01:21:58.874]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:21:59.094 --> 01:22:02.555]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:22:02.755 --> 01:22:10.917]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can too with the help of the ARC Institute's brand new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[01:22:54.951 --> 01:23:00.095]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:00.776 --> 01:23:03.078]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:05.678 --> 01:23:06.338]  Well, uh... We're...
[01:23:35.018 --> 01:23:36.719]  And you've said it many times.
[01:23:36.759 --> 01:23:49.003]  We're going to be turned into a police state so that there's somebody, as you say, spying on us, trying to turn us in every time we say something that might even hint of any kind of problem.
[01:23:51.103 --> 01:24:01.207]  They created the Homeland Security not for the terrorists, but to take care of you and I and others that are going to protest the...
[01:24:02.222 --> 01:24:10.988]  We're going to lose our rights.
[01:24:11.448 --> 01:24:22.915]  In fact, in doing the research I'm working on right now, I looked at the balance of payments and it shows that the U.S.
[01:24:23.056 --> 01:24:29.740]  debt to the rest of the world is approaching three-quarters of a trillion dollars
[01:24:30.382 --> 01:24:33.122]  And is on a straight line headed south.
[01:24:34.283 --> 01:24:36.903]  And our economy cannot survive that.
[01:24:37.563 --> 01:24:39.364]  We're shipping our jobs overseas.
[01:24:39.424 --> 01:24:45.325]  We're allowing immigrants to come into this country illegally.
[01:24:45.425 --> 01:24:52.046]  And the purpose of that is the more people that are looking for jobs, the wages will go down.
[01:24:52.126 --> 01:24:54.206]  It's a supply and demand situation.
[01:24:55.006 --> 01:24:59.547]  They're going to turn this nation into a third world country just as fast as they can.
[01:25:00.683 --> 01:25:03.685]  And the average person is unaware of that.
[01:25:03.885 --> 01:25:05.467]  They can't accept that.
[01:25:06.147 --> 01:25:07.968]  But it's just around the road.
[01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:12.171]  Maybe just a matter of a few months.
[01:25:13.372 --> 01:25:17.976]  The world's supply of oil peaked in the year 2000.
[01:25:18.516 --> 01:25:26.402]  And that is going to create havoc over the entire world.
[01:25:27.426 --> 01:25:31.371]  Petroleum is just about involved in everything that we project.
[01:25:31.471 --> 01:25:37.858]  Well, they'll also use the fear of that as a pretext to gouge, but you work as a consultant for oil companies.
[01:25:38.699 --> 01:25:44.746]  Another subject here, Associated Press, Clinton advisor probed in terror memos.
[01:25:46.127 --> 01:25:47.847]  Yeah, and he stuffs all of the documents in his socks, and...
[01:26:15.310 --> 01:26:19.614]  And he says he accidentally misplaced them or destroyed them.
[01:26:20.055 --> 01:26:20.315]  Right.
[01:26:20.795 --> 01:26:22.337]  He's a very intelligent person.
[01:26:22.357 --> 01:26:25.320]  He just doesn't do that by accident.
[01:26:25.936 --> 01:26:33.642]  Why would he take after-action documents from classified terrorism investigations in 99-2000?
[01:26:33.702 --> 01:26:35.083]  Why would he take those and destroy them?
[01:26:35.363 --> 01:26:45.531]  Well, because eventually someone may surface those documents, and it'll be just absolutely devastating to very high up people in this nation.
[01:26:46.412 --> 01:26:48.093]  And so they've got to destroy them.
[01:26:48.393 --> 01:26:55.639]  And Berger didn't think anything at all about doing it, and he's part of the elite, so he knows he'll get away with it.
[01:26:57.216 --> 01:26:59.618]  I'm wondering why they even searched his house.
[01:26:59.698 --> 01:27:02.260]  The FBI did a search warrant at his house.
[01:27:03.321 --> 01:27:09.085]  It was probably just a routine thing to say, well, we checked him out and he's okay.
[01:27:09.966 --> 01:27:12.187]  He just accidentally stuck them in his pants.
[01:27:13.068 --> 01:27:15.149]  He says he stuck them in his pants on accident.
[01:27:15.570 --> 01:27:19.613]  Yeah, and then someone fell in his sock and he didn't know they were there.
[01:27:19.693 --> 01:27:21.995]  And then when he found them, he just threw them in the trash.
[01:27:22.615 --> 01:27:23.576]  He didn't want that stuff.
[01:27:26.135 --> 01:27:38.099]  I tell you, and then we've got Bush ordering FBI agents to shred prior knowledge documents from early 2001 and then threatening to arrest them if they speak out.
[01:27:40.460 --> 01:27:42.061]  So we've got them all doing it, don't we?
[01:27:42.261 --> 01:27:47.903]  Yeah, but there will be some decent people within the CIA and the FBI.
[01:27:48.043 --> 01:27:53.385]  They're going to be rat-holing a lot of these documents, and eventually they'll come out.
[01:27:53.685 --> 01:27:55.406]  So you can't destroy it all.
[01:27:56.677 --> 01:27:58.017]  But they're trying to.
[01:28:00.138 --> 01:28:07.019]  Well, clearly, in a nutshell, do you agree that it's clear that the military-industrial complex carried out September 11th?
[01:28:08.199 --> 01:28:19.221]  I don't have hard evidence, but everything points in that direction, and I hope that the hard evidence will eventually come out to prove them right or wrong or involved or not.
[01:28:19.321 --> 01:28:23.622]  But they certainly have taken advantage of the 9-1-1 to...
[01:28:25.911 --> 01:28:35.674]  Create Patriot 1 and soon Patriot 2 to take away our rights and create these concentration camps and all of that sort of thing.
[01:28:35.694 --> 01:28:38.835]  That's all a byproduct of the 9-1-1 attack.
[01:28:39.135 --> 01:28:39.956]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:39.976 --> 01:28:40.516]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.957 --> 01:28:44.877]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.357 --> 01:28:46.978]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.878 --> 01:28:50.579]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.464 --> 01:28:59.769]  Just once, I'd like to clean my car's leather upholstery without sliding across the seat on every turn.
[01:29:00.469 --> 01:29:04.874]  Just once, I'd like to get a beautiful shine without a slick, oily residue that attracts dust and dirt.
[01:29:05.455 --> 01:29:08.438]  Introducing just once the amazing non-slip protectant.
[01:29:09.091 --> 01:29:13.176]  Just Once cleans, protects, and shines vinyl, leather, rubber, and hard plastics.
[01:29:13.677 --> 01:29:21.907]  Its patented formula eliminates slippery surfaces, provides optimum UV protection against the sun's harmful rays, and outlasts those other less effective formulas.
[01:29:22.508 --> 01:29:27.294]  Just Once is excellent for use on cars, trucks, motorcycles, boats, truck bed liners, and RVs.
[01:29:28.135 --> 01:29:38.164]  You can use it on dashboard, leather and vinyl interiors, motorcycle seats and tires, floor mats, convertible tops, brake pedals, or anywhere you need ultimate protection, including leather furniture, shoes, and purses.
[01:29:38.744 --> 01:29:42.327]  Just Once has been used commercially nationwide, and now it's available to you.
[01:29:42.948 --> 01:29:49.513]  To order, call 888-578-6623 or visit justonce.com on the World Wide Web.
[01:29:49.893 --> 01:29:51.475]  That's justonce.com.
[01:29:53.587 --> 01:29:54.227]  We're good to go.
[01:30:17.202 --> 01:30:27.067]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:30:27.187 --> 01:30:36.073]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:30:36.333 --> 01:30:39.635]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:30:41.716 --> 01:30:44.338]  I'm a nurse and I injured my back and I've lost 22 pounds and 9 inches.
[01:30:44.358 --> 01:30:46.080]  I would definitely recommend Vim and Vigor.
[01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:49.322]  As far as losing weight, Vim and Vigor is the best investment I ever made.
[01:30:49.582 --> 01:30:50.243]  It actually worked.
[01:31:07.595 --> 01:31:11.037]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[01:31:11.057 --> 01:31:12.558]  I've tried many, many products.
[01:31:12.758 --> 01:31:15.019]  I have never experienced anything like Collagenate.
[01:31:15.379 --> 01:31:19.001]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than eight weeks.
[01:31:19.421 --> 01:31:20.062]  It truly works.
[01:31:20.402 --> 01:31:21.762]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[01:31:22.003 --> 01:31:27.725]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:31:27.806 --> 01:31:33.629]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism, and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[01:31:33.749 --> 01:31:36.330]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate really does work.
[01:31:36.710 --> 01:31:37.751]  It's healthy for you, too.
[01:31:37.931 --> 01:31:38.951]  Call Vim and Vigor today.
[01:31:38.971 --> 01:31:39.211]  1-800-622-THIN.
[01:31:39.271 --> 01:31:39.492]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[01:31:39.552 --> 01:31:40.812]  Get $25 off a three-month supply of collagenate.
[01:31:40.832 --> 01:31:41.452]  So call now.
[01:31:41.472 --> 01:31:41.613]  1-800-622-THIN.
[01:31:41.633 --> 01:31:41.813]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[01:31:41.833 --> 01:31:42.333]  All right, folks.
[01:31:42.353 --> 01:31:42.873]  33 minutes and 10 seconds.
[01:31:42.893 --> 01:31:43.453]  Pass for the hour.
[01:32:07.501 --> 01:32:10.323]  Halfway point of this global broadcast against tyranny.
[01:32:11.203 --> 01:32:13.144]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:32:14.425 --> 01:32:23.330]  Before we go back to Robert Galen Ross, we're going to bring Paul Watson up and go to your calls almost directly here after we talk about some of the news we'll be discussing with Mr. Ross and Mr. Watson.
[01:32:25.852 --> 01:32:26.772]  I've made ten films.
[01:32:26.812 --> 01:32:27.433]  I've written a book.
[01:32:27.473 --> 01:32:28.213]  I've published a book.
[01:32:28.273 --> 01:32:29.174]  Most of you know that.
[01:32:29.254 --> 01:32:30.935]  But a lot of you have not taken action.
[01:32:30.955 --> 01:32:36.418]  You've not ordered my videos or the other great videos I carry or the other wonderful books I carry.
[01:32:37.771 --> 01:32:40.852]  These are the best materials I've found out there, bar none.
[01:32:40.872 --> 01:32:42.692]  We're hearing more and more every month.
[01:32:43.893 --> 01:32:55.096]  We've got George Humphrey's new video, 9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati, one of the best, most succinct documented films I've seen, proving the globalists carried out 9-11.
[01:32:55.116 --> 01:32:59.817]  You want those answers, those questions answered, this is the film.
[01:33:00.997 --> 01:33:03.398]  My film, frankly, I think is the most broad...
[01:33:04.737 --> 01:33:09.658]  Spectrum, at the same time, focused film, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:33:10.298 --> 01:33:13.139]  Of course, part two of that, The Masters of Terror Exposed.
[01:33:13.859 --> 01:33:22.321]  And this is an important subject, a central subject, because governments throughout history carry out terror attacks to scare their populations into submission.
[01:33:23.361 --> 01:33:29.162]  In my film, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, we spend about five minutes on Operation Northwoods out of the two and a half hours.
[01:33:29.662 --> 01:33:30.542]  The official U.S.
[01:33:30.582 --> 01:33:32.943]  government plan to carry out 9-11 style attacks.
[01:33:33.670 --> 01:33:38.434]  Hijack jets and crash them, killing people, to bomb D.C., to kill Marines with U.S.
[01:33:38.534 --> 01:33:40.336]  Army troops dressed up like foreign enemies.
[01:33:41.677 --> 01:33:46.341]  And the government says that by having casualty lists, numbers of dead people in U.S.
[01:33:46.401 --> 01:33:49.503]  newspapers, that this would cause a helpful wave of indignation.
[01:33:50.504 --> 01:33:55.028]  Now, that's just a few minutes of that two-and-a-half-hour film to give you an idea of what's in it.
[01:33:55.988 --> 01:34:08.498]  Another five minutes of the film is FEMA in Kansas City teaching police and firefighters and sheriff's deputies that all Christians are terrorists, the Founding Fathers are bad, and are the enemies of the government, and are terrorists.
[01:34:08.778 --> 01:34:14.803]  And then we have the training manuals where they say homeschoolers and Christians are, and the news articles about those documents.
[01:34:16.164 --> 01:34:18.106]  That's five minutes of the two-and-a-half-hour film.
[01:34:18.526 --> 01:34:20.648]  I've got ten films all as powerful.
[01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:29.289]  Whether it's Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, The Occult Activities of World Leaders, finally in the San Francisco Chronicle in a 14-page article yesterday.
[01:34:30.710 --> 01:34:31.891]  Get my videos.
[01:34:32.092 --> 01:34:37.578]  My 10 videos you're authorized to make copies of for non-profit educational purposes, not for sale purposes.
[01:34:37.718 --> 01:34:43.144]  The other videos by Eric Huffschmidt and George Humphrey and Tex Mars and...
[01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:49.141]  We've got the Loss of Liberty video about that government terror attack on that ship to try to blame it on Egypt.
[01:34:49.641 --> 01:34:52.262]  You can't make copies of those because I can't authorize you to.
[01:34:53.162 --> 01:34:56.942]  The Jews for the Preservation of Firearms ownership video I've got is amazing.
[01:34:57.683 --> 01:35:01.263]  Innocence Betrayed, about 180 million people killed after having their guns taken.
[01:35:02.083 --> 01:35:07.905]  We've got a bunch of different specials on books and videos, so when you call you can ask about titles or specials.
[01:35:07.925 --> 01:35:10.085]  Be sure and do that and take advantage of some of the deals.
[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:14.022]  The toll-free number to order, and operators are there 24 hours a day.
[01:35:14.042 --> 01:35:15.683]  But don't procrastinate.
[01:35:15.723 --> 01:35:16.144]  Call now.
[01:35:16.164 --> 01:35:16.224]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:16.244 --> 01:35:17.565]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:35:17.585 --> 01:35:21.067]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787.
[01:35:40.525 --> 01:35:46.729]  0-4 or 888-253-3139.
[01:35:48.610 --> 01:35:55.375]  And let's bring up Paul Watson, and then we'll bring up Robert Galen Ross, who will be with us for the rest of the broadcast, both of you.
[01:35:55.815 --> 01:35:56.596]  And then we're going to start.
[01:35:58.617 --> 01:36:00.739]  Then I'm going to go ahead and get some of these callers out of the way.
[01:36:02.059 --> 01:36:02.820]  Paul, are you there?
[01:36:04.941 --> 01:36:05.302]  Okay, good.
[01:36:05.342 --> 01:36:05.582]  Good.
[01:36:06.797 --> 01:36:12.080]  Paul, tell folks briefly about PrisonPlanet.tv and then some of the news items you want to cover.
[01:36:13.481 --> 01:36:26.529]  Well, we just added today or last night a preview video for what other people can expect to see on PrisonPlanet.tv, which is a 30-minute segment out of George Humphrey's video, 9-11, The Great Illusion.
[01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:28.310]  We give people a sample.
[01:36:28.926 --> 01:36:37.532]  Of the now dozens of videos, both documentaries and your TV reports that we now have available for everybody on offer.
[01:36:37.692 --> 01:36:50.902]  Well, there's a dozen documentaries and over a dozen of my weekly TV reports now and both are books for download and audio reports and the best audio interviews and all of it in there for 15 cents a day.
[01:36:51.822 --> 01:36:52.343]  That's right.
[01:36:52.683 --> 01:36:55.105]  Special reports as well from writers.
[01:36:55.765 --> 01:36:58.387]  Obviously, every audio interview from the Alex Jones Show
[01:36:58.988 --> 01:37:05.691]  So for $5.95 a month, which is what people spend more on cigarettes, then it's certainly good value for money.
[01:37:05.711 --> 01:37:11.834]  Well, people spend more a day on coffee than they will in a week of listening.
[01:37:12.934 --> 01:37:19.257]  Well, yeah, people don't realize that people who say that they're struggling to afford things, that's understandable, but
[01:37:19.781 --> 01:37:26.526]  You can make small sacrifices and still be able to support us and enjoy all this new content that we're going to be offering.
[01:37:26.846 --> 01:37:28.267]  And it's real simple, folks.
[01:37:28.528 --> 01:37:30.209]  We are victims of our own success.
[01:37:30.249 --> 01:37:36.674]  The New York Post wrote up how they went to my website and watched Road to Tyranny for free a few months ago.
[01:37:37.815 --> 01:37:43.299]  Well, we can't do that anymore because I can't pay $4,000 or $5,000 a month so millions of people can come watch it.
[01:37:44.019 --> 01:37:45.781]  We still offer a lot of stuff for free.
[01:37:47.018 --> 01:37:52.880]  And then that basically then burns up any profit we make on prisonplanet.tv, but that doesn't matter.
[01:37:52.900 --> 01:38:00.582]  The goal is to reach people, so you're helping us reach other folks, and you're getting privileged, exclusive access to all of it.
[01:38:00.602 --> 01:38:08.544]  I mean, Paul Watson's book is 300-plus pages, incredibly well done, $19.95 if you buy it from us, and my book's $12.
[01:38:09.425 --> 01:38:10.725]  They're both on the website.
[01:38:11.351 --> 01:38:12.272]  You can print them off.
[01:38:12.312 --> 01:38:14.093]  You can print copies off and give them to people.
[01:38:14.473 --> 01:38:15.253]  You know, whatever.
[01:38:15.333 --> 01:38:17.735]  Just prisonplanet.tv.
[01:38:18.215 --> 01:38:20.296]  Go sign up via credit card or PayPal.
[01:38:20.937 --> 01:38:24.819]  I recommend you get a yearly membership, folks, because you save a lot of money if you do that.
[01:38:24.859 --> 01:38:27.140]  But there are the monthly memberships.
[01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:30.742]  And now, what is prisonplanet.tv three months old now, Paul?
[01:38:31.863 --> 01:38:32.483]  About that, yeah.
[01:38:32.503 --> 01:38:33.844]  Just coming up to three months now.
[01:38:34.545 --> 01:38:36.566]  So a dozen documentaries plus.
[01:38:37.672 --> 01:38:39.033]  I think we're good to go.
[01:39:02.964 --> 01:39:04.524]  I know you've got a bunch of news.
[01:39:04.564 --> 01:39:06.025]  What are some of the issues you want to cover?
[01:39:06.265 --> 01:39:07.625]  And then we'll go to some calls.
[01:39:08.465 --> 01:39:13.827]  Well, I mean, shouldn't we be talking about the fact that John Kerry has more wrinkles now than he did three months ago?
[01:39:13.867 --> 01:39:16.788]  I mean, that's a hot topic that all the neocons are discussing.
[01:39:17.388 --> 01:39:30.551]  Well, I mean, apart from that, obviously we've posted this new video of this bombing in Fallujah, which dovetails to the things we've posted in the past about the liberation of Iraq, so we need to talk about that.
[01:39:31.469 --> 01:39:39.361]  Perhaps we should talk about the junior high mentality situation where, oh, they hug each other on the campaign trail.
[01:39:39.421 --> 01:39:40.423]  Ha, ha, ha.
[01:39:41.564 --> 01:39:41.945]  No, no, no.
[01:39:41.985 --> 01:39:43.748]  We should be talking about how Kerry...
[01:39:44.819 --> 01:39:52.604]  Yeah, and obviously the spy agency that they've called for, which was in Newsweek, you know, to double the CIA, which is also what the 9-11 Commission are calling for,
[01:40:11.519 --> 01:40:13.800]  And, you know, the fact that Kerry voted for the war.
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:22.042]  He was, in fact, on a big lobbying group a couple of years ago which called for the invasion of Iraq just as the Project for a New American Century group did.
[01:40:22.543 --> 01:40:24.043]  But, you know, nobody's talking about that.
[01:40:24.323 --> 01:40:27.764]  Everybody's talking about whether he's injected Botox into his face.
[01:40:28.244 --> 01:40:31.766]  Or, look, he's out windsurfing.
[01:40:31.806 --> 01:40:32.946]  He's on vacation.
[01:40:34.193 --> 01:40:36.654]  Well, yeah, I mean, it's like when Bush falls off a bike.
[01:40:36.734 --> 01:40:39.196]  I mean, that's top news for three days, though.
[01:40:39.216 --> 01:40:45.079]  It's just about getting past that Hollywood-style news reporting and getting down to the real issues.
[01:40:45.239 --> 01:40:46.620]  Hey, we've got Robert Galen Ross on.
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:49.181]  We're about to go back to him, but here's a few of the bullet points.
[01:40:49.201 --> 01:40:51.162]  He was saying, I mean, clearly...
[01:40:52.325 --> 01:41:00.456]  If someone wants proof of 9-11 that the government did it, to have George Bush say, my bosses did it, here's how we did it, that's never going to happen.
[01:41:00.476 --> 01:41:09.088]  But if you've got Operation Northwoods, the official government plan to carry it out, you've got public officials being warned not to fly the night before.
[01:41:09.848 --> 01:41:11.469]  You've got the hijackers trained at U.S.
[01:41:11.509 --> 01:41:12.470]  military bases.
[01:41:12.810 --> 01:41:16.273]  You've got the FBI ordering FBI agents to back off al-Qaeda.
[01:41:16.573 --> 01:41:17.334]  You've got U.S.
[01:41:17.374 --> 01:41:19.975]  troops massed into Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.
[01:41:20.336 --> 01:41:22.357]  You've got the CIA founding al-Qaeda.
[01:41:22.837 --> 01:41:24.639]  I mean, there are hundreds of those smoking guns.
[01:41:24.659 --> 01:41:25.940]  What are some of the other smoking guns?
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:27.921]  NORAD standing down?
[01:41:29.342 --> 01:41:36.947]  Well, yeah, the lead hijacker's being funded by the Pakistan spy chief who's meeting by the officials who would later investigate 9-11.
[01:41:36.987 --> 01:41:37.208]  And, um...
[01:41:39.522 --> 01:41:54.153]  Maybe not, you know, Bush's reaction, which is what certainly Michael Moore's film focuses on, because, you know, as you said, he's not going to come out and say I was ordered to not have a reaction, because that's probably what he would have done anyway, because he's not aware of the wider agenda.
[01:41:54.553 --> 01:41:57.996]  So, I mean, the smoking guns above that are what we need to get out to people.
[01:41:58.016 --> 01:41:58.756]  Well, it's simple.
[01:41:59.056 --> 01:42:07.963]  There isn't a law enforcement agency, a judge, a jury, that would not convict someone of
[01:42:08.846 --> 01:42:09.527]  We're good to go.
[01:42:09.547 --> 01:42:10.207]  We're good to go.
[01:42:10.287 --> 01:42:10.708]  We're good to go.
[01:42:28.142 --> 01:42:29.323]  No, he's never going to do that.
[01:42:29.784 --> 01:42:31.325]  But can we convict him?
[01:42:31.345 --> 01:42:32.306]  Did he clearly do it?
[01:42:32.326 --> 01:42:33.166]  Did he have the motive?
[01:42:33.407 --> 01:42:35.388]  Did he take out an insurance policy on her?
[01:42:36.769 --> 01:42:39.432]  Yes, clearly they did it, folks.
[01:42:39.832 --> 01:42:41.513]  Robert Galen Ross, any comments to that?
[01:42:44.576 --> 01:42:55.565]  Kerry was talking about Edwards' resume, and one of the statements he made was, well, he attended this event, he attended this conference in Italy,
[01:42:56.181 --> 01:43:03.243]  He didn't say he attended the Bilderberg Conference in Italy, but he was bragging about him attending a conference in Italy.
[01:43:03.543 --> 01:43:06.144]  And they in farm know exactly what he's talking about.
[01:43:06.364 --> 01:43:17.988]  Well, a month after American Free Press broke it here on this broadcast, even before it was in print, Jim Tucker, fresh back from Italy, said that John Edwards was there.
[01:43:18.088 --> 01:43:19.148]  We got photos of it.
[01:43:19.188 --> 01:43:21.549]  Paul, you need to post those photos, by the way.
[01:43:22.290 --> 01:43:24.072]  And so we got photos of it.
[01:43:24.993 --> 01:43:26.375]  And we said, that's going to be the VP.
[01:43:26.395 --> 01:43:28.017]  And everybody else said, no, it's Dick Gephardt.
[01:43:28.037 --> 01:43:29.339]  You know, the New York Post says so.
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:33.003]  And then suddenly, suddenly...
[01:43:33.995 --> 01:43:46.966]  The New York Times two weeks ago comes out, and then again last week, two reports, and said, yes, he impressed the Bilderberg Group, this global government group, and they said, we want him, and they called Kerry on the phone to tell him.
[01:43:47.327 --> 01:43:52.311]  And now he's on Larry King Live, and I wish somebody would give me a tape of that.
[01:43:53.331 --> 01:43:55.492]  I did get a bunch of calls and emails about it.
[01:43:56.053 --> 01:43:57.133]  Robert, did you see that?
[01:43:57.433 --> 01:43:58.234]  No, I missed that.
[01:43:58.594 --> 01:44:00.395]  Let me ask you a question, then we'll go to calls.
[01:44:00.835 --> 01:44:16.822]  Why do you think they're coming out now with 14-page articles about Bohemian Grove, with two articles about the Bilderberg Group, admitting the CFR basically runs things, half the experts on TV are now CFR under their names, the other half are CFR, they just don't tell you.
[01:44:17.641 --> 01:44:18.461]  I'm serious, folks.
[01:44:18.521 --> 01:44:20.502]  I mean, literally, 9 out of 10 are CFR.
[01:44:20.882 --> 01:44:24.064]  I mean, why are they bringing our ruling elite out in the open now?
[01:44:24.544 --> 01:44:29.066]  I think they're trying to prepare us for what's going to be coming next year.
[01:44:30.046 --> 01:44:34.428]  If they say, well, it's inevitable, all this is going to happen.
[01:44:35.228 --> 01:44:39.170]  And so when it really does happen, you say, oh, well, here it is.
[01:44:39.630 --> 01:44:43.452]  What do you think of the call, and this is to both of you, to suspend the election?
[01:44:43.672 --> 01:44:46.893]  They're really out promoting that and selling that right now.
[01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:58.057]  Well, that's just an indication that they're trying to scare the public, saying, well, we may have to postpone the election because there may be a terrorist attack.
[01:44:58.378 --> 01:45:00.519]  Well, they may create one just to prove that.
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:01.940]  Paul?
[01:45:02.921 --> 01:45:10.947]  Well, I mean, as I said, in my view, it's about creating the pretext that voting is a privilege afforded to people by government.
[01:45:11.576 --> 01:45:22.445]  I don't think they'll go ahead and launch an attack on the day of the election because it's too obvious now, but they'll certainly ramp it up to a red alert situation where people are all, you know, wary about it, and it will be a martial law drill.
[01:45:24.206 --> 01:45:28.269]  All of this drilling is like Jim Jones with the Kool-Aid for the real day when they give the order.
[01:45:28.709 --> 01:45:30.571]  Okay, I appreciate the callers holding.
[01:45:32.152 --> 01:45:33.293]  Who's up first here?
[01:45:35.235 --> 01:45:37.496]  Andre in Wisconsin.
[01:45:37.516 --> 01:45:38.217]  Go ahead, Andre.
[01:45:38.277 --> 01:45:38.917]  You're on the air.
[01:45:38.937 --> 01:45:40.038]  How you doing, Jones?
[01:45:40.519 --> 01:45:40.719]  Good.
[01:45:41.158 --> 01:45:41.398]  Good.
[01:45:41.618 --> 01:45:45.781]  I've just got a few thoughts about this election baloney.
[01:45:47.742 --> 01:45:53.385]  You notice that George Bush hasn't come out and said, well, we're going to have elections no matter what.
[01:45:54.566 --> 01:46:00.469]  And if he does it like that, he'll probably get more people to vote for him.
[01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:05.332]  And if nothing happens, you know what I'm saying?
[01:46:07.259 --> 01:46:08.399]  No, I see what you're saying.
[01:46:08.579 --> 01:46:13.741]  I mean, look, his commission that he appointed came out and called for preparing to do this.
[01:46:14.841 --> 01:46:26.925]  And the question is, if both candidates are controlled, Skull and Bones, you know, Bohemian Grove slash Bilderberg group people, CFR folks, they're all in these organizations, why then have discussions of this?
[01:46:26.985 --> 01:46:27.766]  And Paul's right.
[01:46:28.146 --> 01:46:30.607]  It's about training us to accept the unthinkable.
[01:46:30.907 --> 01:46:33.447]  We've never suspended an election, but now it may be needed.
[01:46:35.696 --> 01:46:35.936]  Right.
[01:46:36.316 --> 01:46:40.378]  Have you ever read The Halliburton Agenda by Dan Bioti?
[01:46:40.858 --> 01:46:41.418]  No, I haven't.
[01:46:41.859 --> 01:46:43.079]  It's a pretty good book.
[01:46:43.119 --> 01:46:45.520]  It tells all about Halliburton and stuff like that.
[01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:50.322]  I just got a question for Mr. Watson, if I can.
[01:46:53.043 --> 01:46:53.363]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:53.403 --> 01:46:53.943]  You're on the air.
[01:46:53.963 --> 01:46:54.323]  Go ahead.
[01:46:54.443 --> 01:46:54.763]  Okay.
[01:46:55.944 --> 01:47:01.486]  I saw one of a film put out by BBC on the Bilderberger meetings.
[01:47:01.526 --> 01:47:03.947]  They had it a while back on the Trio Channel.
[01:47:04.739 --> 01:47:05.859]  Yeah, that wasn't the BBC.
[01:47:05.899 --> 01:47:08.040]  That was Channel 4, World of Wonder.
[01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:08.881]  Oh, okay.
[01:47:09.161 --> 01:47:10.221]  Well, it sounded like him.
[01:47:10.321 --> 01:47:17.224]  I didn't know if that was him or not, but if it was... Well, I'm in that film, sir, so... Right, I've seen it.
[01:47:17.344 --> 01:47:19.765]  I have a lot of respect for you and what you're doing.
[01:47:19.805 --> 01:47:21.405]  Well, I wasn't bragging ham in that film.
[01:47:21.425 --> 01:47:23.126]  I'm just letting you know that I know who was in the film.
[01:47:23.446 --> 01:47:25.027]  Paul, you weren't in that film, were you?
[01:47:25.607 --> 01:47:25.707]  No.
[01:47:26.523 --> 01:47:31.106]  That was one of the films that woke me up to the new world order when I was just getting into the whole thing.
[01:47:32.587 --> 01:47:34.708]  It was screened in 2001 in Britain.
[01:47:36.909 --> 01:47:44.093]  All right, well, I'll let you go now, but in case you ever come up to Wisconsin, we certainly welcome you here.
[01:47:44.473 --> 01:47:45.494]  Well, thank you, Andre.
[01:47:45.714 --> 01:47:46.874]  Thank you.
[01:47:47.114 --> 01:47:48.915]  Let's talk to Daryl in Ohio.
[01:47:48.936 --> 01:47:49.796]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:47:49.836 --> 01:47:50.256]  Go ahead.
[01:47:50.897 --> 01:47:51.737]  Hello, Alex.
[01:47:52.197 --> 01:47:52.457]  Yes.
[01:47:52.898 --> 01:47:55.159]  I've been on your show before, and I'm 10 years old.
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:58.943]  And my brother, he's 17 years old.
[01:47:58.983 --> 01:48:00.224]  He's always clowning around.
[01:48:00.284 --> 01:48:06.009]  He's going to turn 18 this year, and he doesn't believe they're going to pull the giraffe out.
[01:48:06.169 --> 01:48:11.313]  What can I do to make him believe that if he doesn't start handling his business, he could be in the Army?
[01:48:11.754 --> 01:48:14.756]  Well, Daniel, it's great to have you on board the broadcast.
[01:48:14.816 --> 01:48:15.857]  How are you listening to us?
[01:48:18.159 --> 01:48:18.739]  On the radio.
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:20.661]  What, a local AM station?
[01:48:21.061 --> 01:48:21.302]  Yes.
[01:48:21.622 --> 01:48:22.883]  What city are you in?
[01:48:23.443 --> 01:48:23.944]  Youngstown.
[01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:25.681]  Well, that's a great affiliate.
[01:48:25.701 --> 01:48:27.782]  We've got several great affiliates up in Ohio.
[01:48:27.802 --> 01:48:28.482]  I want to thank them.
[01:48:30.043 --> 01:48:34.665]  Look, I mean, we've posted the bills.
[01:48:35.806 --> 01:48:45.571]  One of them is S-89, the Universal Service Act, and major senators and congressmen have called for it, and they've shut up the draft boards again.
[01:48:46.031 --> 01:48:48.313]  Paul Watson, Robert Galen Ross, any comments?
[01:48:49.553 --> 01:48:52.495]  Yeah, well, we've now got a search engine on prisonplanet.com.
[01:48:53.530 --> 01:48:59.991]  So if you just go to that and type in draft, you know, military draft, then all the articles and the bills will pop up.
[01:49:00.071 --> 01:49:02.952]  So, I mean, that's an immediate resource which you can use now.
[01:49:04.192 --> 01:49:06.013]  Yeah, we had a search engine, but it wasn't very good.
[01:49:06.053 --> 01:49:07.273]  We've got a really nice one now.
[01:49:08.293 --> 01:49:11.254]  I'm really proud of this young man being concerned about his brother.
[01:49:11.314 --> 01:49:16.095]  That's unusual for a person of that age to express things the way he is.
[01:49:16.135 --> 01:49:17.795]  He's a very mature young man.
[01:49:18.795 --> 01:49:20.495]  But you have to...
[01:49:23.928 --> 01:49:29.769]  Try to get your brother to do everything he can to stay out of the draft.
[01:49:29.849 --> 01:49:36.451]  They eventually may have it, but you certainly don't want to see him do that.
[01:49:36.891 --> 01:49:37.611]  Yeah, I'll tell you what.
[01:49:37.651 --> 01:49:39.151]  Stay there, young man.
[01:49:39.172 --> 01:49:47.974]  We'll be right back to your call when we get back, talk some more, then get to Sherry and Charles and Randy and others.
[01:49:48.254 --> 01:49:49.414]  Stay with us, presentplanet.tv.
[01:49:54.679 --> 01:49:57.566]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:49:58.277 --> 01:49:59.558]  Alex Jones here, America.

[01:50:11.328 --> 01:50:15.511]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:50:15.671 --> 01:50:19.455]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[01:50:19.715 --> 01:50:24.339]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:50:24.439 --> 01:50:27.141]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[01:50:27.501 --> 01:50:30.662]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[01:50:30.722 --> 01:50:32.583]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:50:50.768 --> 01:50:52.869]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:58.325]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.

[01:51:17.404 --> 01:51:36.591]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones, as well as power for small applications.

[01:51:46.075 --> 01:51:46.876]  We're good to go.
[01:52:09.955 --> 01:52:10.356]  I think so.
[01:52:25.472 --> 01:52:25.912]  We're good to go.
[01:52:25.952 --> 01:52:26.292]  I think?
[01:52:56.505 --> 01:53:02.533]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:03.154 --> 01:53:06.157]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:11.885]  Alright, we're talking to...
[01:53:12.927 --> 01:53:14.628]  Daniel in Youngstown, Ohio.
[01:53:30.638 --> 01:53:31.218]  We're good to go.
[01:53:31.278 --> 01:53:31.598]  I think?
[01:53:52.527 --> 01:53:59.330]  I mean, look, I may have been a kook three years ago to say they were going to be putting chips in government officials, but now the Mexican government's doing it.
[01:53:59.870 --> 01:54:01.911]  I mean, it's time to get past the denial.
[01:54:02.571 --> 01:54:04.452]  This stuff is really happening.
[01:54:05.312 --> 01:54:10.314]  But Daniel in Ohio, it's good to have you on board the broadcast.
[01:54:11.855 --> 01:54:13.676]  How did you learn about the show?
[01:54:14.616 --> 01:54:19.598]  Well, my mom, she put you on the air, and I was listening to her
[01:54:22.657 --> 01:54:28.119]  And I was listening to you, so then I just started learning information, me and my family.
[01:54:28.499 --> 01:54:33.281]  But my brother knows this information, but it's like he's hard-headed, and he doesn't want to listen.
[01:54:34.301 --> 01:54:37.883]  And so he just denies that there is a plan to reinstate the draft?
[01:54:39.063 --> 01:54:39.803]  Yes, he does.
[01:54:39.823 --> 01:54:44.905]  It's like you can tell him that there's going to be a draft next year.
[01:54:44.925 --> 01:54:46.646]  He'll just say, yeah, yeah, whatever.
[01:54:46.666 --> 01:54:51.988]  And it's like he's going to be 18 next year, and they can just put him in the Army.
[01:54:53.169 --> 01:54:54.890]  I might not ever see him again.
[01:54:54.990 --> 01:54:57.772]  Well, there may not be a draft if we're able to stop it.
[01:54:57.812 --> 01:55:05.855]  I mean, there's already giant petitions in Congress to stop it, but the bills are introduced, and your brother's not the only one denying this.
[01:55:06.196 --> 01:55:12.419]  But it's good to have you on board, and please spread the word about the show and take care of my friend.
[01:55:12.799 --> 01:55:13.159]  I will.
[01:55:13.729 --> 01:55:14.369]  God bless you.
[01:55:14.849 --> 01:55:21.951]  That is very, very exciting, and we have so many young people listening to the broadcast, and I just thank God for the opportunity.
[01:55:22.551 --> 01:55:29.092]  We're about to go to Sherry in Kansas, but Robert Galen Ross, Paul Watson, any comments?
[01:55:29.592 --> 01:55:42.155]  Well, as I said earlier, I'm very proud of that young man for his love for his brother and trying to keep him safe, and I hope that that doesn't turn out to be a negative thing for him.
[01:55:44.037 --> 01:55:50.219]  Well, I mean, look, people are good at denying the facts because they don't want to face up to it until it's too late.
[01:55:51.340 --> 01:55:53.041]  Sherry in Kansas, you're on the air.
[01:55:53.081 --> 01:55:53.761]  Go ahead, Sherry.
[01:55:54.481 --> 01:55:54.681]  Hi.
[01:55:55.041 --> 01:55:55.201]  Hello.
[01:55:55.221 --> 01:55:56.002]  How are you doing?
[01:55:56.202 --> 01:55:56.342]  Good.
[01:55:56.362 --> 01:55:56.562]  Hi, Alex.
[01:55:56.582 --> 01:55:57.402]  How are you doing?
[01:55:58.363 --> 01:56:00.103]  I live out here in Kansas with my husband.
[01:56:00.123 --> 01:56:01.444]  We listen to your show daily.
[01:56:02.384 --> 01:56:05.065]  We have a subscription to your website and everything.
[01:56:05.705 --> 01:56:07.326]  My husband called.
[01:56:08.286 --> 01:56:15.211]  Yeah, the airline that had that pod on the bottom of the airplane that they say crashed into the World Trade Center.
[01:56:15.672 --> 01:56:22.817]  And they gave him the runaround, and he finally talked to someone that wanted to put him off.
[01:56:22.957 --> 01:56:28.361]  But they want to say that, you know, it's national security.
[01:56:28.999 --> 01:56:30.700]  Yeah, well, that's actually been in the news.
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:41.283]  United in America have declared national security concerning all their aircraft, people not seeing windows, people seeing pods, the video of that.
[01:56:41.944 --> 01:56:43.144]  Paul Watson, any comments?
[01:56:44.004 --> 01:56:54.268]  Well, yeah, we also had the audio a few months ago of, I think it was an NBC reporter, talking to Albert Tiore, who was the chief of the New York Fire Department,
[01:56:54.781 --> 01:56:58.384]  Who said that he thought there were bombs on board both planes.
[01:56:58.824 --> 01:57:07.711]  Because, I mean, from studying the video of Flight 11, it's obvious that that fires some kind of projectile into the building, which it then enters the building through.
[01:57:07.751 --> 01:57:09.353]  It creates the hole in which it goes through.
[01:57:09.913 --> 01:57:15.798]  And obviously the analysis of the thing on the underside of Flight 175 shows the same thing.
[01:57:15.838 --> 01:57:19.721]  It shows a missile hitting the building in the moments before the plane impacts it.
[01:57:20.649 --> 01:57:25.271]  Well, I just wish more people would call the congressman in person and call the airlines.
[01:57:25.751 --> 01:57:33.415]  And Alex, did you get that email I sent you about Japan is already putting the microchip in children over there?
[01:57:33.955 --> 01:57:37.557]  Well, yeah, that was actually in the Associated Press.
[01:57:38.237 --> 01:57:40.838]  First it was the ID cards, now in the children, yes.
[01:57:41.178 --> 01:57:41.799]  Thanks for the call.
[01:57:41.859 --> 01:57:42.659]  Third hour coming up.
[01:57:50.337 --> 01:57:50.977]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.637 --> 01:57:52.678]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.398 --> 01:57:54.519]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.159 --> 01:57:56.000]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.740 --> 01:57:57.621]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.641 --> 01:58:02.103]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.483 --> 01:58:06.606]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.507 --> 01:58:10.288]  All right, folks.
[01:58:10.488 --> 01:58:16.511]  Hour number three on this live Tuesday edition, the 20th day of July 2004.
[01:58:20.171 --> 01:58:22.872]  A bunch of Big Brother news I want to go over.
[01:58:23.252 --> 01:58:23.372]  U.S.
[01:58:23.432 --> 01:58:27.313]  media kill story that Iraqi Prime Minister executed six prisoners.
[01:58:28.193 --> 01:58:28.733]  Is the U.S.
[01:58:28.753 --> 01:58:30.233]  becoming a nation of snitches?
[01:58:30.333 --> 01:58:32.434]  Crime database sparks privacy fears.
[01:58:32.814 --> 01:58:34.254]  It's called the Matrix System.
[01:58:34.914 --> 01:58:38.635]  New developments with people in the Mexican government getting tracker chips.
[01:58:38.655 --> 01:58:40.055]  You have to have them to get into the government.
[01:58:40.615 --> 01:58:42.436]  Florida moving to ban protest.
[01:58:43.956 --> 01:58:48.577]  And just so much more that we will be discussing.
[01:58:49.568 --> 01:58:52.914]  Also, I want to go over some of the things that the government does to its own people.
[01:58:53.695 --> 01:58:56.720]  And, of course, then we'll go to Charles and Randy.
[01:58:59.665 --> 01:59:00.306]  We're good to go.
[01:59:27.425 --> 01:59:40.623]  But getting into some of this Big Brother news now, for folks that just joined us, the TIPS program, the Total Information Awareness program, the Matrix program, they're all part of the CIA and the National Security Agency program.
[01:59:41.221 --> 01:59:44.663]  And this is, quote, to fight terror and crime, and now they're going to recruit.
[01:59:45.003 --> 01:59:46.624]  This program was never shelved, by the way.
[01:59:47.184 --> 01:59:53.008]  All the truck drivers, all the firefighters, all the exterminators, the carpet cleaners, the telephone people.
[01:59:53.568 --> 01:59:56.910]  When they're in your house without a warrant, the cops can have a warrant, but they don't.
[01:59:57.450 --> 01:59:59.591]  When they're in your house, you're paying them to spy on you.
[01:59:59.791 --> 02:00:01.212]  I'm paying you to fix my phone?
[02:00:01.472 --> 02:00:09.655]  Well, they're going to spy on you, looking for terror and perhaps evidence of crime, so they can then have probable cause to raid your house.
[02:00:10.055 --> 02:00:11.956]  Robert Galen Ross, is this America?
[02:00:12.016 --> 02:00:12.616]  Is this freedom?
[02:00:13.657 --> 02:00:16.298]  Certainly it's not freedom, but it's where we're headed.
[02:00:16.758 --> 02:00:24.001]  A police state dominated by the elite that are running all this to create their new world order.
[02:00:26.261 --> 02:00:27.441]  And it doesn't keep us safe.
[02:00:27.501 --> 02:00:29.102]  I mean, the borders are more open than ever.
[02:00:29.582 --> 02:00:33.343]  Yes, they come across the border by the thousands.
[02:00:33.863 --> 02:00:45.747]  When Bush said he would consider amnesty, they all just jumped up and headed for the border, because once they're in here, then they can declare amnesty and become citizens.
[02:00:45.767 --> 02:00:48.087]  I mean, again, it's all a sick joke.
[02:00:48.147 --> 02:00:48.787]  Paul Watson?
[02:00:49.788 --> 02:00:50.608]  Well, yeah, and obviously...
[02:00:51.332 --> 02:01:00.479]  The citizenry of the country have to be recruited to spy on each other because there are not enough enforcers to blanket the whole of the country to carry it out.
[02:01:01.059 --> 02:01:06.483]  Again, with the Highway Watch Program, which is the new tips, basically.
[02:01:06.503 --> 02:01:07.604]  They've just renamed it.
[02:01:08.845 --> 02:01:20.674]  It's obvious that these toll roads that you've been talking about, Alex, will use the automatic recognition camera technology in the future, which is already being used in London, and then that will be a kind of
[02:01:21.465 --> 02:01:23.766]  And they've said they're going to do this.
[02:01:23.786 --> 02:01:25.066]  I mean, it's not debatable.
[02:01:25.086 --> 02:01:28.266]  And, again, everyone I know in Austin is against the nine toll roads.
[02:01:28.286 --> 02:01:30.227]  It's really more than that.
[02:01:30.247 --> 02:01:31.607]  This is just phase one on existing roads.
[02:01:45.962 --> 02:01:50.304]  But the government laughs at us because there's no more voting because of the electronic voting machines.
[02:01:51.164 --> 02:01:52.204]  Robert, comments to that?
[02:01:52.644 --> 02:02:06.049]  Yeah, the electronic voting machines, once they use those, there's no traceability, and once it becomes electronic form, they can alter it to come out with any results they want.
[02:02:06.430 --> 02:02:12.932]  They would do that, and there's nothing we can do about it except protest and protest.
[02:02:14.184 --> 02:02:18.665]  So they will keep on trying to gain control over us.
[02:02:19.425 --> 02:02:23.506]  And I was thinking about the election in itself.
[02:02:23.526 --> 02:02:37.529]  You know, in reality, if Ralph Nader or some other third-party candidate were to get 80% of the votes, the popular votes, that doesn't mean he would become president because electoral college is...
[02:02:39.009 --> 02:02:42.260]  Supplied, the members are supplied by the two major parties.
[02:02:42.340 --> 02:02:43.203]  Tell you what, stay there.
[02:02:43.243 --> 02:02:43.725]  We've got a break.
[02:02:43.745 --> 02:02:44.628]  We'll talk about it when we get back.
[02:02:48.283 --> 02:02:53.767]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:54.188 --> 02:02:58.411]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:02:58.651 --> 02:03:05.697]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:06.077 --> 02:03:12.182]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:12.322 --> 02:03:13.523]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:13.723 --> 02:03:14.203]  We're good to go.
[02:03:14.243 --> 02:03:14.724]  We're good to go.
[02:03:30.655 --> 02:03:33.777]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[02:03:33.797 --> 02:03:34.017]  866-885-6625.
[02:03:34.037 --> 02:03:34.097]  866-885-6625.
[02:03:34.138 --> 02:03:35.058]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:03:35.078 --> 02:03:35.298]  Call today.
[02:03:46.374 --> 02:03:49.375]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:03:49.715 --> 02:03:58.538]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:03:58.858 --> 02:04:03.520]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:10.727]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:04:11.128 --> 02:04:22.940]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[02:04:45.126 --> 02:04:49.492]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:04:49.672 --> 02:04:54.098]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:04:54.238 --> 02:04:58.644]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:04:58.664 --> 02:05:00.025]  The New World Order.
[02:05:01.787 --> 02:05:06.012]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:05:06.072 --> 02:05:13.020]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:05:13.140 --> 02:05:15.163]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:05:15.523 --> 02:05:25.929]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:31.532]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:05:51.683 --> 02:05:52.763]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.464 --> 02:05:54.544]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.205 --> 02:05:56.025]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.786 --> 02:05:57.666]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.686 --> 02:06:02.008]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.529 --> 02:06:06.631]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:09.793 --> 02:06:10.453]  All right, folks.
[02:06:10.493 --> 02:06:11.714]  Thanks again for joining us.
[02:06:11.754 --> 02:06:14.535]  Toll-free number to get involved on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:18.795 --> 02:06:23.699]  Charles and Randy and Stacy and others, your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[02:06:24.679 --> 02:06:26.141]  But I wanted to get to some of this news.
[02:06:27.261 --> 02:06:29.163]  Now, this is a tactic the media uses.
[02:06:29.263 --> 02:06:31.905]  Porting down bioweapons lab.
[02:06:33.397 --> 02:06:38.120]  The two last heads of it, one died in a small plane crash last week.
[02:06:38.601 --> 02:06:42.383]  The other was Dr. David Kelly, which witnesses saw men in black uniforms around him.
[02:06:42.403 --> 02:06:43.324]  They'd slit his wrist.
[02:06:43.704 --> 02:06:45.645]  He told friends, they're going to murder me.
[02:06:46.045 --> 02:06:48.867]  This has all been in an article here, an article there, all admitted.
[02:06:51.329 --> 02:06:52.690]  But this is how the media does it.
[02:06:53.430 --> 02:06:59.995]  I have probably seen, conservatively, 200 articles, more than that, about Porton Down.
[02:07:00.495 --> 02:07:00.815]  I mean, in 1984...
[02:07:03.374 --> 02:07:04.195]  Not the book, folks.
[02:07:04.235 --> 02:07:07.718]  In the year 1984, they had a bunch of U.S.
[02:07:07.758 --> 02:07:19.447]  and British troops stand out in a farmer's field in tanks, and planes, fixed-wing aircraft, flew over, sprayed them with chemical weapons.
[02:07:20.128 --> 02:07:21.609]  Some died that afternoon.
[02:07:21.729 --> 02:07:23.711]  Others died a month later, and they tracked it all.
[02:07:24.171 --> 02:07:25.072]  Imagine, just stand out here.
[02:07:25.092 --> 02:07:25.712]  We're going to kill you.
[02:07:25.752 --> 02:07:27.494]  They didn't tell them, just, we're going to kill you.
[02:07:27.514 --> 02:07:29.175]  Cold blood, your troops, we're going to kill you.
[02:07:30.382 --> 02:07:31.823]  I mean, imagine if Al-Qaeda did that.
[02:07:31.843 --> 02:07:32.344]  Well, it would be.
[02:07:32.364 --> 02:07:35.006]  It would be the government doing it if Al-Qaeda did it.
[02:07:35.146 --> 02:07:35.946]  Al-CIA did it.
[02:07:36.927 --> 02:07:37.928]  So I see that article.
[02:07:37.968 --> 02:07:38.629]  BBC.
[02:07:38.689 --> 02:07:41.331]  I see another article about the 60s them doing it.
[02:07:41.351 --> 02:07:42.612]  Then an article about the 50s.
[02:07:43.512 --> 02:07:45.354]  Always different articles.
[02:07:45.634 --> 02:07:46.895]  Always different reports.
[02:07:47.335 --> 02:07:49.097]  Never bringing it all together.
[02:07:50.138 --> 02:07:56.803]  It was porting down that accidentally released from its level 4 bioweapons containment weaponized foot and mouth.
[02:07:57.429 --> 02:08:06.138]  Back in 99, and they killed 4 million cows, 8 million sheep, and then I predicted the government would not allow the restocking of cows and sheep to then take the private property, which they did.
[02:08:06.158 --> 02:08:07.259]  I just don't know how they operate.
[02:08:08.681 --> 02:08:11.804]  It also helped punish the farmers who were against entering the Euro.
[02:08:12.705 --> 02:08:16.469]  Scientists kept body parts of 1953 nerve gas victim.
[02:08:17.650 --> 02:08:19.032]  London Telegraph yesterday.
[02:08:19.801 --> 02:08:26.525]  Government scientists secretly removed body parts from a national serviceman who died after taking part in a nerve gas experiment.
[02:08:26.966 --> 02:08:28.507]  A new inquest has been told.
[02:08:29.187 --> 02:08:37.412]  And it shows Lillis Craik with a picture of her brother, Ronald Madison.
[02:08:38.653 --> 02:08:43.096]  And he's just a nice, handsome young man, proud of his uniform, trying to serve his country.
[02:08:43.356 --> 02:08:45.117]  And they just go, come right in here, please.
[02:08:45.557 --> 02:08:46.618]  And they nerve gas him.
[02:08:46.638 --> 02:08:48.239]  They cut his body up, don't ask.
[02:08:49.807 --> 02:08:51.808]  Folks, well, that was back in the 50s.
[02:08:51.948 --> 02:08:53.309]  Yeah, they've gotten more evil.
[02:08:54.149 --> 02:08:56.110]  As part of Project Shad, which the U.S.
[02:08:56.150 --> 02:09:03.513]  and Britain carried out for two decades, one of the last tests in 84, and this is the declassified stuff, they just killed our people.
[02:09:04.153 --> 02:09:06.234]  Oh, but they wouldn't take your rights away.
[02:09:06.254 --> 02:09:10.156]  Doesn't matter if they don't want you to have a record of how you voted.
[02:09:10.276 --> 02:09:12.337]  Never mind if there's been a lot of fraud they've been caught in.
[02:09:12.637 --> 02:09:13.257]  Just trust them.
[02:09:13.777 --> 02:09:17.499]  Government scientists secretly removed body parts from a national serviceman.
[02:09:18.306 --> 02:09:31.673]  Up to 200 separate samples were taken from the 20-year-old Ronald Madison's brain, spinal cord, heart, and skin without his family's permission days after he died at Porton Down, Wilshire, the government's top-secret chemical warfare research base.
[02:09:33.074 --> 02:09:40.898]  The body parts have since been used in a number of experiments by scientists researching the effects of toxic chemical agents on human tissue.
[02:09:41.418 --> 02:09:47.181]  Details of the removal of organs from the airman's body has emerged during a new inquest into the death which opened in May.
[02:09:47.904 --> 02:09:57.454]  The original inquest, held in secret in 53, found that leading aircraftman Madison's death was accidental.
[02:09:57.594 --> 02:10:02.099]  But the new inquest will examine fresh evidence and decide whether the original verdict still stands.
[02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:06.003]  Mr. Madison, from Concett,
[02:10:07.001 --> 02:10:11.464]  Durham was among hundreds of national servicemen who volunteered, and again, some of them didn't, folks.
[02:10:11.484 --> 02:10:12.224]  I've read these articles.
[02:10:12.684 --> 02:10:19.148]  In the 50s and 60s, they'd take part in tests reporting down in the belief that they were helping scientists find a cure for the common cold.
[02:10:19.648 --> 02:10:21.069]  So see, they didn't really volunteer.
[02:10:21.089 --> 02:10:24.310]  Again, I've read past articles, so before I even finished reading it, I knew that.
[02:10:24.831 --> 02:10:32.755]  The airman died less than an hour after 200 milligrams of the highly toxic seronerve agent were placed on layers of cloth on the inside of his arms.
[02:10:34.412 --> 02:10:49.496]  Robert Hogg, the witness who made the body parts disclosure in an inquest at Crown Bridge, revealed that parts of Mr. Madison's skin, brain, spinal cord, heart, stomach, lung, and other muscles were removed without the knowledge of his family.
[02:10:50.677 --> 02:11:02.280]  Mr. Hogg was employed at the laboratory, assistant during his national service, and had to serve, National Service Act, what we're going to have here, also revealed that the body parts could still be in existence.
[02:11:03.951 --> 02:11:13.218]  Mr. Hogg, now retired Senior Chief Scientific Officer, told the inquest that in May of 1953 he was summoned by his line manager and told that one of the volunteers had died.
[02:11:14.139 --> 02:11:21.225]  He was given orders to drive to Salisbury Infirmary where the post-mortem examination was to take place in a waiting car.
[02:11:23.566 --> 02:11:28.010]  And it goes on to basically say that they all knew about it and killed the guy on purpose.
[02:11:28.590 --> 02:11:30.412]  Okay, thanks for holding through that, but...
[02:11:31.107 --> 02:11:35.508]  Robert Galen Ross, we've had thousands, over 3,000 open air tests.
[02:11:36.008 --> 02:11:39.188]  Again, in 68, they killed people on the New York subways.
[02:11:39.468 --> 02:11:40.069]  That's public.
[02:11:40.389 --> 02:11:41.309]  We're going to kill you.
[02:11:41.589 --> 02:11:44.309]  We're going to release it and kill some Americans and see what it does.
[02:11:45.649 --> 02:11:49.990]  I've interviewed the people on board ships in the 70s where they fly over and spray them.
[02:11:50.030 --> 02:11:54.411]  People would die on the spot or die a year later or be sick 30 years later.
[02:11:56.391 --> 02:11:59.872]  Number one, how do they get people to man aircraft to spray this?
[02:11:59.912 --> 02:12:00.452]  Well, it's simple.
[02:12:01.067 --> 02:12:13.275]  They go out and they have them spray innocuous stuff dozens of times until they're trained to do it, like they're doing nationwide in public drills, and then when it's the real stuff one day, or they can use drones now to do it.
[02:12:13.575 --> 02:12:18.158]  And we have official government plans to do this for the entire population if they want to.
[02:12:18.438 --> 02:12:20.099]  Robert Galen Ross comments on this.
[02:12:20.759 --> 02:12:30.225]  Well, it goes back to the Senate hearings back in the 70s where the CIA actually admitted that they did this sort of experimentation thing.
[02:12:30.632 --> 02:12:35.754]  ...with LSD and all sorts of drugs on people without their knowledge.
[02:12:36.714 --> 02:12:58.643]  And back to the subject of the pilots of these planes spreading these chemicals, they did a survey in a Marine base in California to find out and ask a whole bunch of questions, and the purpose was to find out which soldiers would actually shoot on...
[02:12:59.724 --> 02:13:03.566]  And again, would you agree it's about creating cadres of sociopathic people?
[02:13:03.586 --> 02:13:05.146]  I mean, my point is, folks, police, military.
[02:13:25.365 --> 02:13:32.911]  Just for some reason today and yesterday, I came across probably 15 articles of them doing stuff to cops, military, right now.
[02:13:33.572 --> 02:13:38.956]  So my point is, is this has been going on, and this is your government.
[02:13:38.996 --> 02:13:41.278]  This is who you serve.
[02:13:41.638 --> 02:13:42.299]  Paul Watson?
[02:13:43.159 --> 02:13:44.641]  Well, yeah, they do it to their own people.
[02:13:44.901 --> 02:13:46.682]  And I mean, you mentioned Porton Down.
[02:13:46.702 --> 02:13:53.888]  I mean, that was one of the major manufacturing points for the weapons that were shipped out to Iraq in the late 80s and the early 80s.
[02:13:54.443 --> 02:14:00.945]  And now, today, the Gulf War veterans, the first independent investigation into Gulf War illness.
[02:14:00.985 --> 02:14:06.867]  The government has told the scientists which were researching it not to talk to the independent inquiry.
[02:14:06.907 --> 02:14:07.548]  They've gagged them.
[02:14:08.228 --> 02:14:09.728]  I mean, yeah, they do it to their own people.
[02:14:09.748 --> 02:14:13.209]  I mean, they drop plague bombs on Scotland out of the same place.
[02:14:14.090 --> 02:14:20.952]  And it's the central hub of the biowarfare attack on the London Underground, which they've been hyping for years now.
[02:14:21.572 --> 02:14:23.353]  There was another exercise which was
[02:14:24.019 --> 02:14:35.304]  On CNN, which focused on a case in Birmingham where the guys in the black biomass were walking around ordering people into temporary camps and things like that.
[02:14:35.364 --> 02:14:37.145]  And so that's where it's all going.
[02:14:37.425 --> 02:14:44.628]  Yeah, last week, just walking around, and they said they're going to be called rest and relocation centers for millions of Britons.
[02:14:46.128 --> 02:14:47.689]  And same thing here in the U.S.
[02:14:48.729 --> 02:14:50.050]  And folks, we're not...
[02:14:50.638 --> 02:14:51.439]  We're not joking.
[02:14:51.459 --> 02:14:54.521]  When Paul says plague bombs in Scotland, we have all the articles.
[02:14:54.901 --> 02:14:57.603]  In fact, I have that article right here.
[02:14:58.864 --> 02:15:02.667]  MOD gag on details of Gulf War illness, London Telegraph.
[02:15:03.407 --> 02:15:11.313]  The manipulations and maneuvers of the Ministry of Defense were condemned yesterday after it approached scientists researching Gulf War syndrome.
[02:15:12.401 --> 02:15:16.203]  It asked them to limit their cooperation with an independent inquiry into veterans' illnesses.
[02:15:16.223 --> 02:15:22.667]  The criticism came on the second day of open hearings to Lord Lloyds of Berwick and former Lord Justice on appeal.
[02:15:23.628 --> 02:15:29.431]  The inquiry had been taking testimony from servicemen who blamed the 91 conflict for a range of subsequent medical problems.
[02:15:29.872 --> 02:15:34.775]  So the Ministry of Defense went to all the appropriate scientists and told them to lie.
[02:15:35.315 --> 02:15:36.376]  Now, that's admitted now.
[02:15:36.516 --> 02:15:38.537]  So let me expand on this, then we'll go to calls.
[02:15:40.988 --> 02:15:44.630]  Yesterday, I'm at KLBJ for three hours, local radio.
[02:15:44.710 --> 02:15:53.694]  They bring in this young military officer from the Army, 26 years old, serious intelligence type.
[02:15:53.974 --> 02:15:55.155]  And I said, are you in intelligence?
[02:15:55.215 --> 02:15:55.515]  Yes.
[02:15:55.535 --> 02:15:56.416]  Can you talk about it?
[02:15:56.496 --> 02:15:56.696]  No.
[02:15:57.596 --> 02:16:00.197]  And it turns out he was in Guckheimer's unit.
[02:16:00.217 --> 02:16:05.340]  Remember, he was in the Ithaca Journal, said they were ordered to kill everyone in whole villages, men, women, children, babies.
[02:16:06.514 --> 02:16:09.496]  And he went into this, and I said, listen to me.
[02:16:09.776 --> 02:16:11.858]  And he's all for the government, this guy they were interviewing.
[02:16:12.518 --> 02:16:13.399]  But he was in the same unit.
[02:16:13.419 --> 02:16:14.400]  He was one of the leaders.
[02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:18.663]  And he's written this book called, what is it, One Man's Army.
[02:16:19.543 --> 02:16:20.964]  And I said, well, what about DU?
[02:16:21.024 --> 02:16:23.166]  I mean, your own scientist said it's going to make you really sick.
[02:16:23.186 --> 02:16:24.227]  And he just laughed at me.
[02:16:24.487 --> 02:16:31.792]  I mean, they're on such a power trip that I guess they'll just love being killed by their own government.
[02:16:31.892 --> 02:16:33.073]  Robert Galen Ross comments...
[02:16:33.715 --> 02:16:50.699]  Yeah, this has been proved time and time again, where they used DU in Kosovo, where they used it in Kuwait, in Iraq, and our own troops are going to have problems with that result of it for the rest of their lives.
[02:16:50.999 --> 02:16:53.200]  But they'll laugh at you when you tell them that.
[02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:55.040]  Sure.
[02:16:55.100 --> 02:16:58.301]  When their own, the guy that wrote the book, Dr. Rocky, has been on this show.
[02:16:59.036 --> 02:17:04.181]  He wrote the book for the Pentagon on it, and he went and studied it, and most of his unit has died, and he's deathly ill.
[02:17:06.563 --> 02:17:08.324]  Paul Watson just makes you sick, doesn't it?
[02:17:09.385 --> 02:17:09.785]  Well, yeah.
[02:17:10.086 --> 02:17:24.978]  You said he was a younger member of the military, then it's an illustration of the mindset that they have, and how they're given orders to carry out all this horror, because it's to create a blood oath and a kind of gang mentality, just as killing a pregnant woman on the streets of L.A.
[02:17:25.018 --> 02:17:25.359]  would be.
[02:17:25.719 --> 02:17:26.620]  So these scum, you know...
[02:17:29.551 --> 02:17:34.674]  It's incredible.
[02:17:34.814 --> 02:17:38.076]  And then if you criticize them, you're against our fine young men in uniform.
[02:17:38.916 --> 02:17:40.737]  We're trying to protect those men in uniform.
[02:17:40.757 --> 02:17:42.018]  We'll be back with your calls.
[02:17:46.289 --> 02:17:49.150]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:17:49.510 --> 02:17:52.372]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:17:52.612 --> 02:17:58.814]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[02:17:59.194 --> 02:18:06.497]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[02:18:06.677 --> 02:18:10.779]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.

[02:18:46.016 --> 02:18:48.317]  My family's breathing easier, and now you can too!
[02:18:48.498 --> 02:18:51.840]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the Biozone Air Purifier.
[02:18:51.940 --> 02:18:54.161]  The Biozone Air Purifier is not a filter system.
[02:18:54.321 --> 02:19:00.285]  It works at the molecular level, binding the small bits of dust, allergens, and other particles in your air into clumps that are too heavy to float.
[02:19:00.505 --> 02:19:03.066]  They fall harmlessly to the floor to be literally swept away.
[02:19:03.326 --> 02:19:04.007]  Nothing escapes.
[02:19:04.107 --> 02:19:08.349]  The Biozone Air Purifier also kills virus and bacteria germs and totally removes odors.
[02:19:08.509 --> 02:19:12.152]  Out on the farm, we have several cats and two big dogs, so pet odors can be a concern.
[02:19:12.252 --> 02:19:14.473]  But like the odors from anything else, simply gone.
[02:19:14.733 --> 02:19:15.373]  We're good to go.
[02:19:15.413 --> 02:19:15.893]  We're good to go.
[02:19:45.330 --> 02:19:50.034]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[02:19:50.274 --> 02:19:53.717]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[02:19:53.938 --> 02:19:56.400]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[02:19:56.640 --> 02:20:05.248]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[02:20:05.608 --> 02:20:11.373]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[02:20:11.633 --> 02:20:13.594]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[02:20:13.834 --> 02:20:20.775]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.
[02:20:21.115 --> 02:20:27.577]  Midas Resources is pleased to offer a subscription to the International Forecaster newsletter free of charge with a qualifying order.
[02:20:27.837 --> 02:20:28.317]  That's right.
[02:20:28.397 --> 02:20:35.159]  For a limited time, Midas Resources is offering a one-year subscription to Bob Chapman's powerful newsletter, the International Forecaster.
[02:20:35.419 --> 02:20:39.864]  Call 800-686-2237 for more information or to place your order.
[02:20:39.964 --> 02:20:40.184]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:20:40.224 --> 02:20:42.226]  Call today and avoid getting soaked tomorrow.
[02:20:45.615 --> 02:20:47.917]  The sun is getting brighter and the days are getting longer.
[02:20:48.117 --> 02:20:49.438]  Summer's just around the corner.
[02:20:49.678 --> 02:20:50.900]  What are your plans for it?
[02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:51.580]  Fishing?
[02:20:51.860 --> 02:20:52.301]  Gardening?
[02:20:52.361 --> 02:20:52.781]  Camping?
[02:20:52.981 --> 02:20:55.123]  I'm sure you'll spend more time enjoying the outdoors.
[02:20:55.343 --> 02:20:58.526]  And I'm sure the ticks and mosquitoes will spend more time enjoying you.
[02:20:58.746 --> 02:21:01.108]  It's not just itching and scratching we have to worry about.
[02:21:01.388 --> 02:21:04.771]  Now there's incurable illnesses like Lyme disease and the West Nile virus.
[02:21:05.112 --> 02:21:10.216]  Deet is proven to keep the bugs away, but it's also proven to cause brain damage in laboratory animals.
[02:21:10.556 --> 02:21:16.359]  That's not a choice I want to make, and I don't have to, thanks to Natural Answer, available at naturalanswer.com.
[02:21:16.519 --> 02:21:22.822]  You'll get a 100% natural, deed-free insect repellent formulated by a mother concerned with the well-being of her children.

[02:21:29.246 --> 02:21:30.126]  Make the right choice.

[02:21:34.048 --> 02:21:35.269]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:35.289 --> 02:21:36.469]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:58.087 --> 02:22:00.208]  Rationalizing disinformation.
[02:22:00.228 --> 02:22:04.390]  Later, we're going to tell you how to get Galen Ross' great books and materials.
[02:22:06.251 --> 02:22:07.832]  And we're going to continue with your calls now.
[02:22:07.852 --> 02:22:11.914]  And I've got a bunch of other news I'm going to get their response to, because I respect both their views on it.
[02:22:12.934 --> 02:22:16.756]  Let's talk to Charles in Florida, then Randy, Stacy, Dave, and others.
[02:22:16.916 --> 02:22:17.677]  Go ahead, Charles.
[02:22:17.837 --> 02:22:18.697]  Hey, how you doing there, Alex?
[02:22:18.777 --> 02:22:19.558]  I love your program.
[02:22:19.978 --> 02:22:22.399]  This is the only short wave I can when it comes in pretty clear.
[02:22:22.970 --> 02:22:32.892]  But I just heard an advertisement on my local radio station to donate plasma, and I could use the money for that, but they want to re-immunize me for smallpox.
[02:22:33.692 --> 02:22:39.153]  And I just wonder, is there a lot number I should look for a vaccine, which may be dangerous, or should I just say to heck with it?
[02:22:39.993 --> 02:22:42.594]  Excuse me, let me stop you right there.
[02:22:43.974 --> 02:22:49.015]  You're telling me that a local blood bank... Well, I don't know what a blood bank is.
[02:22:49.075 --> 02:22:50.656]  It's some kind of blood thing.
[02:22:50.676 --> 02:22:52.636]  Let me just stop you right there.
[02:22:55.175 --> 02:22:56.215]  Now, be specific.
[02:22:57.656 --> 02:23:03.581]  Are you saying they have an ad running saying, we want to take your blood, but first we want to immunize you?
[02:23:03.941 --> 02:23:07.243]  Well, they want to take my blood, and part of this is to pay me money.
[02:23:07.263 --> 02:23:08.724]  They want to re-immunize me, too.
[02:23:10.346 --> 02:23:14.268]  Okay, let me explain something to you.
[02:23:14.308 --> 02:23:17.371]  See, this is the problem with time and constraints and guests and everything.
[02:23:17.451 --> 02:23:18.872]  I mean, I could spend two hours on this.
[02:23:19.659 --> 02:23:23.962]  Do you remember two years ago when they tried to forcibly inoculate the police and firefighters?
[02:23:24.222 --> 02:23:24.422]  Yeah.
[02:23:25.343 --> 02:23:29.345]  Okay, do you remember how it turned out the vaccine was bad and killed a bunch of people?
[02:23:29.465 --> 02:23:29.785]  Oh, yeah.
[02:23:30.466 --> 02:23:30.826]  Okay.
[02:23:31.306 --> 02:23:42.954]  Well, now they're coming up with ways to pay people to take it, and they found with psychological warfare that if they advertise one thing, give blood, it's good, and by the way, part of your payment will give you a shot.
[02:23:43.556 --> 02:23:51.099]  If they were saying, give you the shot beforehand, you're not supposed to take that and give blood for, I think, two months, because they admit it can give people smallpox!
[02:23:51.719 --> 02:23:56.081]  So now they've got a blood drive and quote, get your smallpox while you're at it.
[02:23:56.441 --> 02:24:03.744]  If they can make the enforcers take it, then they're going to have the Model State Health Emergency Powers Act emergency, and they're going to make all of us take it.
[02:24:04.004 --> 02:24:05.165]  That's the official plan.
[02:24:05.445 --> 02:24:07.446]  Paul Watson, comment, then Galen Ross.
[02:24:08.606 --> 02:24:12.448]  Yeah, well, you only have to look at the New Scientist report last week, which talked about
[02:24:12.947 --> 02:24:13.467]  We're good to go.
[02:24:13.588 --> 02:24:13.768]  I think?
[02:24:33.502 --> 02:24:38.826]  Everybody knows that these vaccines are horrible, so, I mean, they have to pay people, and that's the desperation.
[02:24:38.886 --> 02:24:44.791]  Yeah, sir, I mean, they know a lot of folks need money to go get blood to do it, but that's going to be interesting in the future.
[02:24:44.811 --> 02:24:48.134]  You've got to take a vaccine when you're going to get blood, or you can't get blood when we need blood.
[02:24:48.814 --> 02:24:49.595]  Galen, comments?
[02:24:49.955 --> 02:24:55.800]  Yeah, there's a high-tech technology subject related here, and that's nanobots.
[02:24:56.300 --> 02:25:01.344]  They can take these sub-miniature robots...
[02:25:01.826 --> 02:25:07.709]  I have an AP report from two days ago where it said that 20 major food suppliers are already putting nanotech in the food.
[02:25:23.295 --> 02:25:26.898]  And we don't know what the purpose is, and we don't know what it takes to open them up.
[02:25:27.338 --> 02:25:31.941]  Well, let's just trust people, Galen, who kill our own troops on purpose.
[02:25:31.981 --> 02:25:32.422]  Go ahead.
[02:25:32.602 --> 02:25:32.842]  Sure.
[02:25:32.862 --> 02:25:34.543]  I'm sorry for interrupting.
[02:25:34.563 --> 02:25:38.105]  Go ahead.
[02:25:38.125 --> 02:25:48.853]  No, these people are derivatives of the Nazi criminals that were brought over to the United States under Operation Papercliff right after World War II.
[02:25:49.959 --> 02:25:55.181]  That same mentality is creating all these things to harm us.
[02:25:56.261 --> 02:26:00.522]  And we can't think like they do because it's not natural to us.
[02:26:00.602 --> 02:26:02.743]  But they have no problems doing this sort of thing.
[02:26:03.223 --> 02:26:05.624]  By the way, folks, this is all admitted, okay?
[02:26:06.984 --> 02:26:08.245]  Anything else, Charles?
[02:26:08.445 --> 02:26:08.865]  Not much.
[02:26:08.885 --> 02:26:09.405]  Thank you very much.
[02:26:10.689 --> 02:26:13.271]  You know, this just gets more and more out of control.
[02:26:13.331 --> 02:26:17.475]  I've seen the news reports where they're paying people to take the smallpox shot, but isn't that nice?
[02:26:17.975 --> 02:26:20.157]  Oh, when you get blood, we're going to give you a shot free.
[02:26:20.217 --> 02:26:22.719]  By the way, you know how they promote the flu shot, folks?
[02:26:23.119 --> 02:26:34.669]  They took the mercury out of most of the vaccines because of all the lawsuits and evidence of brain damage, CDC's own numbers, but now the flu shot that they push on people, they added more, up to 250 times safe levels, Paul.
[02:26:37.787 --> 02:26:47.222]  Well, in a way it's positive because before they were just trying to get it through mandatorily by hyping the fear of a smallpox attack in, you know, late 2001, early 2002.
[02:26:47.603 --> 02:26:50.628]  So the fact that they're now having to switch the...
[02:26:51.255 --> 02:26:58.378]  The other side of the Pavlovian reward and punishment conditioning by trying to pay people to take it.
[02:26:59.218 --> 02:27:00.319]  In a way, it's positive.
[02:27:00.359 --> 02:27:07.262]  Well, they've caught people, like the family that first got the chip, and now thousands of Americans have it, thousands of people worldwide also have it.
[02:27:07.762 --> 02:27:13.504]  The first people that got it were actually turned out to work for the company and had staged press conferences that weren't even real.
[02:27:14.805 --> 02:27:18.006]  But then idiots see that and think, oh, I've got to get that.
[02:27:19.261 --> 02:27:20.182]  Robert, do you agree with that?
[02:27:20.482 --> 02:27:25.287]  Yeah, it's a subliminal suggestion for what it is.
[02:27:25.467 --> 02:27:27.268]  Probably the best term is mind control.
[02:27:28.990 --> 02:27:29.571]  I agree with you.
[02:27:29.651 --> 02:27:33.474]  Okay, we'll come back, take more calls, get into whatever subjects you gentlemen want to talk about.
[02:27:33.514 --> 02:27:33.915]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.297 --> 02:27:37.218]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.698 --> 02:27:39.299]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.220 --> 02:27:42.903]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.016 --> 02:27:54.263]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:27:54.524 --> 02:27:58.887]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:27:59.188 --> 02:28:08.096]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:28:08.316 --> 02:28:11.939]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:28:12.159 --> 02:28:12.860]  We're good to go.
[02:28:12.901 --> 02:28:13.341]  We're good to go.
[02:28:26.039 --> 02:28:31.401]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:28:45.879 --> 02:28:47.220]  Is your daily commute a grind?
[02:28:47.380 --> 02:28:51.143]  If it wears on your patience, you'll be amazed at how it grinds on your car or truck, too.
[02:28:51.324 --> 02:28:55.027]  Your engine and transmission wear away mile after mile and day after day.
[02:28:55.347 --> 02:28:58.970]  Hundreds of NT oil additive customers have reported increased fuel mileage.
[02:28:59.190 --> 02:29:03.634]  Fleets that conduct used oil analysis report up to 30% reduction in wear metals.
[02:29:03.954 --> 02:29:07.757]  NT oil additive is a 100% synthetic product made to perform.
[02:29:07.997 --> 02:29:08.698]  It really works.
[02:29:08.958 --> 02:29:15.043]  NT oil additive has been proven in many thousands of engines, manual and automatic transmissions, and other driveline components.
[02:29:15.383 --> 02:29:16.824]  We accept MasterCard and Visa.
[02:29:16.864 --> 02:29:21.467]  The order department is open from 8 to 5 Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, and on Saturday until noon.

[02:29:45.666 --> 02:29:47.627]  Simple, fast, affordable, and bulletproof.
[02:30:08.061 --> 02:30:09.982]  Let the Asset Protection Team show you how.
[02:30:10.182 --> 02:30:13.104]  Call now, 888-240-3337.

[02:30:20.128 --> 02:30:20.648]  Don't wait.
[02:30:20.828 --> 02:30:29.192]  Plan your strategy today before you encounter a lawsuit, bankruptcy, accident, judgment, lien, probate, creditor, medical crisis, malpractice, or worse.
[02:30:29.433 --> 02:30:37.597]  Plan today before you are confronted with a false claim, divorce, audit, state agency, federal agency, restraining order, an angry ex-partner, or worse.
[02:30:37.777 --> 02:30:40.619]  All right, we've got about 26 and a half minutes left.
[02:30:40.639 --> 02:30:49.026]  I want to get to all the calls that are holding.
[02:30:49.646 --> 02:30:51.888]  We'll get to you here in just a few minutes.
[02:31:01.010 --> 02:31:05.452]  And then into any other subjects our guests want to cover, I've got a few other news articles I want to get into.
[02:31:05.472 --> 02:31:13.196]  I want to remind you the websites are prisonplanet.tv, infowars.com, and prisonplanet.com.
[02:31:13.897 --> 02:31:23.402]  And for those that are also visiting infowars.net, we're about to overhaul and revamp that website, so that's going to be happening here very soon, too.
[02:31:25.022 --> 02:31:25.403]  Okay.
[02:31:27.563 --> 02:31:37.113]  Just for the next few minutes, and I'm honored to have her, I appreciate her coming on, is Debbie Morrow, who you'll be calling when you call New Millennium Concept to stop drinking the poison water.
[02:31:38.094 --> 02:31:51.507]  I have a lot of friends, a lot of family that know the water's bad, that know it's full of Prozac and mercury and Ritalin and MBTE and lead and arsenic and everything else, but you still drink it.
[02:31:53.829 --> 02:31:55.530]  People say, well, I just drink bottled water.
[02:31:55.570 --> 02:32:00.814]  Statistically, many times, tap water and contaminated even worse, folks.
[02:32:02.576 --> 02:32:07.419]  Because, you know, at least most tap water, the bacteria have been killed by the deadly chemicals you're drinking.
[02:32:07.839 --> 02:32:11.702]  But in bottled water, they have time for the chemicals to break down and bacteria to grow.
[02:32:11.742 --> 02:32:13.404]  And we've read those reports.
[02:32:14.524 --> 02:32:18.347]  So it's a filtration system, several different systems, made in America.
[02:32:18.367 --> 02:32:21.910]  This is water purification, not just filtration.
[02:32:22.737 --> 02:32:29.782]  And if you try to buy comparable systems at your camping supply or survival place, you'll pay hundreds of dollars more.
[02:32:30.643 --> 02:32:36.627]  Debbie, tell folks about the Big Berkey, the Berkey Light, and how folks can order it and some of the specials.
[02:32:37.267 --> 02:32:38.048]  Hi there, Alex.
[02:32:38.168 --> 02:32:39.309]  Thanks for having me.
[02:32:40.029 --> 02:32:44.513]  Well, you did a great job of describing the different systems just now.
[02:32:45.053 --> 02:32:47.835]  They're gravity-fed water filter systems.
[02:32:48.331 --> 02:32:56.478]  And they last years, and you can get additional filters for in the future, and they will last you a lifetime.
[02:32:56.498 --> 02:33:13.011]  It's something that is a great investment, whether it's a health investment as well as a financial investment, because the cost of buying bottled water can also be so expensive, and lugging water back and forth.
[02:33:13.551 --> 02:33:17.675]  I was in Los Angeles over the weekend, and I saw this big sign that said...
[02:33:18.703 --> 02:33:20.746]  How do you say water in Spanish?
[02:33:20.987 --> 02:33:21.427]  Agua.
[02:33:21.668 --> 02:33:22.148]  Agua.
[02:33:22.649 --> 02:33:26.876]  And it was in the middle of this parking lot, and it was like this little water machine.
[02:33:27.397 --> 02:33:29.600]  And it said, Agua, 15 cents.
[02:33:30.161 --> 02:33:33.947]  And I saw people lined up, you know, with their, like, milk dugs.
[02:33:34.727 --> 02:33:35.848]  You fill them with water.
[02:33:36.028 --> 02:33:37.950]  Oh, yeah, people know instinctively.
[02:33:38.410 --> 02:33:42.593]  Well, in L.A., they filter the sewage water, and that's what you drink.
[02:33:42.813 --> 02:33:53.121]  Well, yeah, but the bad thing is I told my friend who was driving, I said, you know, the water that they're buying is no different than the water that's coming out of the tap.
[02:33:54.162 --> 02:33:59.066]  You know, I mean, they might have a little filter on there, but who knows who maintains those machines?
[02:33:59.758 --> 02:34:03.899]  You know, you go into grocery stores, you go into different places, you don't know who maintains those machines.
[02:34:03.939 --> 02:34:06.360]  Yeah, people think they don't have power over their lives.
[02:34:06.420 --> 02:34:07.821]  The New World Order dominates them.
[02:34:07.901 --> 02:34:09.781]  Your body's 70% water.
[02:34:10.161 --> 02:34:12.182]  Stop drinking their poison.
[02:34:12.602 --> 02:34:13.802]  It's that simple.
[02:34:13.862 --> 02:34:18.324]  This is a government that will line our own troops up and spray them with nerve gas in 1984.
[02:34:18.384 --> 02:34:18.584]  Right.
[02:34:18.644 --> 02:34:21.685]  You know, this is declassified stuff.
[02:34:22.205 --> 02:34:24.526]  We have a government that will kill our own trips for fun.
[02:34:25.027 --> 02:34:27.268]  Now, don't think they're not doing stuff to you in the water.
[02:34:27.348 --> 02:34:27.888]  They are.
[02:34:27.928 --> 02:34:31.830]  We've had neuroscientists, brain surgeons, you name it on.
[02:34:32.311 --> 02:34:33.871]  Debbie, tell them about a couple of the specials.
[02:34:33.911 --> 02:34:36.873]  Well, we have the Berkey Light for $199.
[02:34:37.173 --> 02:34:40.315]  That is the basic Berkey Light system.
[02:34:40.355 --> 02:34:42.076]  And with that, you get one free gift.
[02:34:42.816 --> 02:34:47.539]  And then with the Berkey Light that comes with the lights, it's $259.
[02:34:47.599 --> 02:34:49.180]  And with that, you get two free gifts.
[02:34:49.700 --> 02:34:51.321]  And the gifts are either the Berkey...
[02:34:51.909 --> 02:34:52.590]  Yes, we are.
[02:35:18.024 --> 02:35:21.265]  They are really handy to have, and they make great gifts.
[02:35:21.305 --> 02:35:28.728]  And I would add that the element in your filters is about twice the size and weight of stuff you pay $35 at the store for.
[02:35:29.068 --> 02:35:37.971]  This isn't purification, this is filtration, but it will make river, pond, water clean, cut out all the microbes, not make you sick.
[02:35:37.991 --> 02:35:40.412]  You'll still get some of the chemicals, but it reduces those.
[02:35:41.032 --> 02:35:46.674]  The Berkey light system, and it's called light because it has a light in it up at the top,
[02:35:47.666 --> 02:35:48.346]  For emergencies.
[02:35:48.446 --> 02:35:49.747]  It cuts it all out, folks.
[02:35:50.047 --> 02:35:51.688]  So you need to give Debbie a call at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:35:51.748 --> 02:35:52.228]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:35:52.248 --> 02:35:53.749]  Or go to BerkeyWater.com.
[02:36:05.033 --> 02:36:08.795]  And just say what free gift you want in the comments section, and then it's an Alex Jones special.
[02:36:08.815 --> 02:36:09.676]  We'll get the discount.
[02:36:10.036 --> 02:36:12.438]  And you can order via their secure online shopping cart.
[02:36:12.478 --> 02:36:16.520]  You can also do that at infowars.com.
[02:36:17.120 --> 02:36:18.982]  And we give them those orders every single day.
[02:36:19.282 --> 02:36:20.382]  And it's made in America.
[02:36:20.442 --> 02:36:21.403]  They support the show.
[02:36:21.443 --> 02:36:22.404]  They do a great job.
[02:36:22.424 --> 02:36:25.726]  1-888-803-4438 or murkywater.com.
[02:36:25.766 --> 02:36:26.706]  Go ahead, Debbie.
[02:36:27.046 --> 02:36:32.730]  Oh, I was just going to say that you're taking control of your life.
[02:36:33.588 --> 02:36:36.069]  You can maintain your own water system.
[02:36:36.129 --> 02:36:39.550]  Why go out and buy it from a thing in the grocery store?
[02:36:39.770 --> 02:36:49.352]  If this costs you $199, in a few months you'll get that back, not buying the tap water they put in bottles.
[02:36:49.653 --> 02:36:50.233]  Absolutely.
[02:36:50.753 --> 02:36:52.353]  And we stand behind our product.
[02:36:52.453 --> 02:36:54.754]  Any concerns, questions, I talk to everybody.
[02:36:54.774 --> 02:36:56.274]  I help everybody out and
[02:36:59.110 --> 02:37:03.816]  We're a good company to do business with, and we love supporting you, Alex.
[02:37:04.136 --> 02:37:05.238]  We love what you're doing, Debbie.
[02:37:05.278 --> 02:37:05.718]  Take care.
[02:37:05.939 --> 02:37:06.479]  Take care.
[02:37:06.539 --> 02:37:07.000]  Bye-bye.
[02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:07.861]  Good to hear from you.
[02:37:07.901 --> 02:37:08.161]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:37:08.282 --> 02:37:10.705]  I'll just put Robert Galen Ross on the spot.
[02:37:11.365 --> 02:37:11.546]  Robert...
[02:37:14.894 --> 02:37:15.975]  Do you filter your water?
[02:37:16.015 --> 02:37:17.076]  Do you trust this government?
[02:37:17.676 --> 02:37:24.740]  No, I don't trust it at all because I know that one element that they put in the water is fluoride.
[02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:30.344]  And fluoride not only does not prevent cavities, it causes cavities.
[02:37:30.404 --> 02:37:38.949]  It all causes Alzheimer's and attention deficit disorder and many problems that are coming out in people.
[02:37:40.140 --> 02:37:43.082]  So we know that they're deliberately doing this.
[02:37:43.642 --> 02:38:03.175]  Fluoride is a toxic element, and if you read the label on your toothpaste tube or the box it comes in, it will tell you, do not swallow this, because if you do, immediately call the Poison Control Center or your local medical doctor.
[02:38:04.355 --> 02:38:05.916]  And it also builds up.
[02:38:06.016 --> 02:38:07.958]  It's something that never really leaves your body, folks.
[02:38:07.978 --> 02:38:08.398]  That's right.
[02:38:09.133 --> 02:38:10.754]  Yeah, it does.
[02:38:11.034 --> 02:38:18.578]  It goes into the bones and it stays there and it builds and it will lead to major problems.
[02:38:19.118 --> 02:38:23.540]  Well, all over the world, people have literally rioted to have it removed.
[02:38:23.861 --> 02:38:27.282]  There aren't hundreds of studies by universities and scientific organizations.
[02:38:27.623 --> 02:38:29.684]  There are thousands of how deadly it is.
[02:38:30.184 --> 02:38:38.028]  I've got UT studies from the University of Texas at Austin from the 30s about how it is a toxic sedative.
[02:38:39.156 --> 02:38:43.457]  Okay, side issue, but briefly, Robert, how do folks get your books and information?
[02:38:44.137 --> 02:38:52.019]  They can go to my website, which is www.4rie.com.
[02:38:52.059 --> 02:38:55.539]  That's 4-R-I-E.com.
[02:38:56.200 --> 02:38:58.240]  Or they can call my toll-free number, which is 800-410-5571.
[02:38:58.300 --> 02:38:58.500]  That's 800-410-5571.
[02:39:10.350 --> 02:39:13.231]  5571.
[02:39:11.691 --> 02:39:13.231]  And some of the books you've got.
[02:39:14.371 --> 02:39:17.172]  Well, my first book was Who's Who of the Elite.
[02:39:17.332 --> 02:39:21.972]  It was originally published in 1995 and was updated in 2000.
[02:39:23.513 --> 02:39:29.474]  And my second book was The Elite Serial Killers of Lincoln, JFK, RFK, and MLK.
[02:39:30.334 --> 02:39:35.095]  I produced a video titled The American Union by 2005.
[02:39:38.169 --> 02:39:44.331]  I produced a video of Madeline Duncan Brown telling about a secret meeting the night before Kennedy was killed.
[02:39:44.711 --> 02:39:48.332]  And that was admittedly the mistress of LBJ.
[02:39:48.553 --> 02:39:49.373]  He even had his son.
[02:39:49.613 --> 02:39:52.034]  Yes, he was his mistress for 21 years.
[02:39:52.054 --> 02:39:53.934]  He gave birth to his only known son.
[02:39:55.095 --> 02:40:03.017]  And the book I'm working on now, which will probably come out in September, will be titled The Elite Don't Dare Let Us Tell the People.
[02:40:04.358 --> 02:40:04.778]  All right.
[02:40:06.118 --> 02:40:10.440]  Now look, I've got a bunch of calls here, I want to go to them, but we've got time, some time here.
[02:40:11.561 --> 02:40:16.584]  Paul Watson, Robert Galen Ross, any news items, any pieces of information you think people need to hear about?
[02:40:17.304 --> 02:40:18.765]  What do you think is most important right now?
[02:40:19.465 --> 02:40:25.628]  Well, I think it's clear now that the summer and the autumn news cycle is all going to be about how we need to invade Iran.
[02:40:26.309 --> 02:40:30.691]  Because obviously now the independent 9-11 Commission has said that
[02:40:31.164 --> 02:40:36.127]  Iran provided a safe way for the 9-11 hijackers to enter and leave the country.
[02:40:36.968 --> 02:40:49.457]  Of course, as we know, the fact is that, you know, no government more so than the US government facilitated the movements of these individuals, even if they were responsible for the attacks, you know, in and out of several different countries.
[02:40:50.137 --> 02:41:00.224]  Because, I mean, we had the Newsweek article last year, I believe it was early last year or the previous year, where Nawaf al-Zahmi and Khalid Aldimar, who were on...
[02:41:00.734 --> 02:41:06.242]  Flight 77 were tracked out of the US to this supposed Al-Qaeda meeting in Malaysia.
[02:41:06.801 --> 02:41:07.562]  In January 2000.
[02:41:07.642 --> 02:41:08.182]  Well, yeah, and
[02:41:37.026 --> 02:41:45.672]  You know, alongside that we've got the Bush administration, this anonymous official, saying that they're going to try and foster a regime change by supporting revolts within the country.
[02:41:46.112 --> 02:41:47.913]  And they were already doing that over a year ago.
[02:41:48.494 --> 02:41:53.477]  But then again, running parallel is this Israeli threat to destroy the nuclear reactor.
[02:41:54.258 --> 02:42:02.363]  Because the London Times reported that when Russia transfers the rods for enriching the uranium at the end of next year, that that's when Israel will go ahead and strike.
[02:42:02.898 --> 02:42:15.650]  But I remember, and I think it's in my book actually, this BBC report which detailed how the British government had sold to the Iranians what amounted to what they described as a shopping list for nuclear weapons construction.
[02:42:16.271 --> 02:42:18.653]  But we've also caught Israeli companies doing it.
[02:42:19.534 --> 02:42:21.796]  Yeah, so all the while, you know, they're hyping them as a threat.
[02:42:22.437 --> 02:42:25.400]  Then they're arming them, as is the case with North Korea.
[02:42:26.040 --> 02:42:26.321]  But then...
[02:42:27.724 --> 02:42:31.907]  You know, the so-called Independent Commission has given the neocons exactly what they wanted.
[02:42:32.247 --> 02:42:42.073]  It's kind of like Fahrenheit 9-11, where the phony left-winger led to believe that Saudi Arabia was behind 9-11, which, again, in the PNAC documents...
[02:42:42.475 --> 02:42:47.378]  They list Saudi Arabia as one of the countries which they want to go ahead and invade in the next 10, 15 years.
[02:42:47.559 --> 02:42:52.462]  And the Saudis are on the record saying that it's the globalists carrying out the attacks to destabilize.
[02:42:52.922 --> 02:42:55.524]  The Iranians are saying we wouldn't dare attack anything.
[02:42:55.564 --> 02:42:57.405]  You think we want you to invade us?
[02:42:57.886 --> 02:43:04.691]  I mean, again, it's like an 85-pound Ethiopian attacking an 800-pound gorilla with 14-inch fangs.
[02:43:05.191 --> 02:43:06.392]  I mean, why would they do that?
[02:43:06.452 --> 02:43:06.972]  They wouldn't.
[02:43:07.032 --> 02:43:08.153]  Then you look at the motive.
[02:43:08.553 --> 02:43:08.994]  They wouldn't.
[02:43:09.034 --> 02:43:09.994]  Then you look at the evidence.
[02:43:10.014 --> 02:43:10.855]  They're not behind it.
[02:43:12.097 --> 02:43:15.441]  Roderick Allen Ross, how important is the PNAC document?
[02:43:15.801 --> 02:43:17.723]  And for those that don't know what it is, why don't you tell them?
[02:43:19.125 --> 02:43:20.987]  I'm not familiar with that document, Alex.
[02:43:22.288 --> 02:43:24.050]  The Project for a New American Century?
[02:43:24.390 --> 02:43:25.311]  No, I'm not familiar with it.
[02:43:26.032 --> 02:43:27.354]  Paul, why don't you tell folks about it?
[02:43:28.415 --> 02:43:33.961]  Well, it's a think tank organization, principal members of which are Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, and Pearl.
[02:43:34.639 --> 02:43:58.604]  Who, going back to, I believe, the mid-90s, actually published some strategy documents for both the Clinton and Bush administration, which is why I said earlier Kerry was in on these kind of groups, because he was, detailing the future geopolitical goal of rebuilding the American military in order to create staging posts for invasions around the world, first in the Middle East, obviously.
[02:43:59.184 --> 02:44:01.845]  And it gives a list of all the countries they want to invade,
[02:44:02.427 --> 02:44:07.069]  And then in 2000, Dick Cheney authored a PNAC document at PNAC.info, their own website, they're very proud of it, saying, Saddam isn't a threat.
[02:44:24.375 --> 02:44:31.600]  He is a convenient pretext to secure the resources of Iraq and to use Iraq as a staging base to invade Iran and Syria.
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:38.144]  And then he went on to say we need a helpful Pearl Harbor event to mobilize the American people.
[02:44:39.425 --> 02:44:43.108]  Yeah, and that quote's in my book, and it was reported on by several different newspapers.
[02:44:43.928 --> 02:44:47.170]  And, you know, also we've been talking about biowarfare.
[02:44:47.731 --> 02:44:52.674]  That's all in the document, this race-specific bioweapon, which they plan to first release on the Muslims.
[02:44:53.234 --> 02:44:54.035]  So it's all in there.
[02:44:54.910 --> 02:44:58.431]  Robert, I know you're aware of the rice-specific bioweapons.
[02:44:58.451 --> 02:44:59.532]  Do you have any comments on that?
[02:45:00.872 --> 02:45:01.773]  Yes.
[02:45:02.253 --> 02:45:19.459]  Both the Israelis and the people down in South Africa had major experiments on gene-specific viruses, and the South Africans wanted to create a virus that would kill black people but not white people.
[02:45:20.200 --> 02:45:25.702]  And the Israelis want a gene-specific virus to kill Arabs and not Israelis.
[02:45:26.582 --> 02:45:40.566]  They have not perfected that yet, and there's no danger in that because they don't know that most of the Arabs, most of the Israelis might have Arab genes.
[02:45:41.406 --> 02:45:44.107]  And so that's a very dangerous game for them to play.
[02:45:44.347 --> 02:45:48.668]  Well, if they're a real Jew, they're going to have those genes.
[02:45:49.765 --> 02:46:03.171]  Well, but I'm convinced that the majority of the people in control are the international bankers, and most of those are Khazarian Jews and not Semitic Jews.
[02:46:03.731 --> 02:46:07.733]  And they have no Semitic background genes in their system.
[02:46:08.573 --> 02:46:10.574]  So there's a major danger for them.
[02:46:12.501 --> 02:46:21.327]  Absolutely, and Jane's weapons publication last year put out an alert and said Israel is developing this, and they say they haven't developed it yet, but we know what's going on.
[02:46:21.347 --> 02:46:24.349]  Well, obviously, whatever they're telling us about is decades old.
[02:46:25.510 --> 02:46:42.121]  Yeah, that's so dangerous because our genealogy, our genomes, is so mysterious that we really don't know what it's all about, and so when they start messing with that, they're playing Russian revet.
[02:46:43.012 --> 02:46:46.174]  Yeah, they could accidentally have a release.
[02:46:46.214 --> 02:46:47.895]  The elite wants to get rid of 80% of us.
[02:46:48.115 --> 02:46:51.117]  There was an accidental release.
[02:46:51.157 --> 02:46:53.678]  Let's go ahead and imagine if that happens, folks.
[02:46:54.138 --> 02:46:55.259]  Randy in Florida.
[02:46:55.319 --> 02:46:55.999]  Randy, go ahead.
[02:46:56.039 --> 02:46:56.620]  Thanks for holding.
[02:46:58.441 --> 02:46:58.981]  Hey, gentlemen.
[02:46:59.361 --> 02:46:59.741]  Hello.
[02:46:59.821 --> 02:47:01.002]  Is the webmaster still there?
[02:47:01.843 --> 02:47:02.843]  Yes, Paul Watson's here.
[02:47:03.123 --> 02:47:08.306]  Okay, anyway, what became of the idea of having the Constitution Party candidate on your show as a guest?
[02:47:08.807 --> 02:47:11.188]  Well, the webmaster doesn't set up guests for the radio show.
[02:47:12.219 --> 02:47:12.981]  Well, okay.
[02:47:13.682 --> 02:47:14.944]  So the question still stands.
[02:47:16.628 --> 02:47:17.569]  Well, I might do that.
[02:47:17.910 --> 02:47:19.473]  I just haven't gotten around to it.
[02:47:19.513 --> 02:47:20.315]  What else is on your mind?
[02:47:21.467 --> 02:47:29.909]  Well, tell the webmaster the link to the cartoon on the American Dictator, Skull and Bones, isn't working.
[02:47:29.990 --> 02:47:31.930]  Is that on InfoWars or Prison Planet?
[02:47:32.030 --> 02:47:32.830]  Oh, InfoWars.
[02:47:33.190 --> 02:47:37.212]  Yeah, for some reason, sometimes when we update, that clip goes bad, and I appreciate that.
[02:47:37.252 --> 02:47:38.652]  I'm sorry that clip is dead.
[02:47:38.992 --> 02:47:42.533]  Why don't you send an email to tips at InfoWars.com?
[02:47:43.613 --> 02:47:45.234]  Well, I mean, he heard that, right?
[02:47:45.674 --> 02:47:48.515]  Well, again, there's a different webmaster for InfoWars.
[02:47:48.895 --> 02:47:49.315]  Okay.
[02:47:49.435 --> 02:47:49.695]  Tips?
[02:47:51.428 --> 02:47:53.129]  Tips at Infowars.com.
[02:47:53.649 --> 02:47:54.029]  Okay.
[02:47:55.009 --> 02:47:55.929]  I'll do it.
[02:47:56.029 --> 02:47:58.850]  And, you know, I do mean to get the Constitution Party guest on.
[02:47:58.910 --> 02:48:01.591]  I just, it takes me a while sometimes.
[02:48:02.071 --> 02:48:02.431]  Okay.
[02:48:02.491 --> 02:48:03.071]  Thanks for the call.
[02:48:03.931 --> 02:48:07.032]  We're going to break here, and we'll come back and talk to Stacy, Dave, and James.
[02:48:07.052 --> 02:48:08.133]  That'll be it for calls.
[02:48:08.773 --> 02:48:10.913]  I do want to thank our guests for coming on.
[02:48:10.953 --> 02:48:14.975]  We'll come back and take calls and get their brief comments on what the callers have to say.
[02:48:16.075 --> 02:48:20.096]  But if you've got guest ideas, email them to tips at Infowars.com.
[02:48:21.087 --> 02:48:23.228]  And then tell us how to contact the person, too.
[02:48:23.268 --> 02:48:23.988]  That always helps.
[02:48:25.169 --> 02:48:28.510]  Sometimes you call up a campaigner or somebody on, and they don't know you from Adam.
[02:48:28.530 --> 02:48:29.130]  They don't come on.
[02:48:29.450 --> 02:48:34.512]  I'm not saying that's happened here, but again, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:34.973 --> 02:48:35.873]  But I have to be honest with you.
[02:48:35.893 --> 02:48:37.514]  We don't even have an election in this country.
[02:48:38.534 --> 02:48:39.714]  Let's be frank about it, folks.
[02:48:40.275 --> 02:48:40.735]  Stay with us.
[02:48:46.204 --> 02:48:47.705]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.865 --> 02:48:50.966]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:51.106 --> 02:48:54.987]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:55.047 --> 02:48:59.289]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:48:59.629 --> 02:49:03.390]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.470 --> 02:49:05.351]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.931 --> 02:49:08.834]  Police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:49:08.895 --> 02:49:13.600]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.760 --> 02:49:16.804]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.984 --> 02:49:19.867]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.348 --> 02:49:26.455]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.975 --> 02:49:27.696]  We're good to go.
[02:49:27.716 --> 02:49:28.196]  We're good to go.
[02:49:46.132 --> 02:49:49.133]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:49:49.473 --> 02:49:58.297]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:49:58.617 --> 02:50:03.299]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:03.759 --> 02:50:10.482]  The Berkey Light is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:10.862 --> 02:50:22.647]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:23.127 --> 02:50:27.592]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:50:27.772 --> 02:50:30.215]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:30.255 --> 02:50:32.077]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:50:32.097 --> 02:50:33.298]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:50:33.378 --> 02:50:35.480]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:50:35.520 --> 02:50:36.581]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:50:46.587 --> 02:50:52.510]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:52.730 --> 02:50:54.991]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:50:55.172 --> 02:51:01.535]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:51:01.875 --> 02:51:02.516]  We're good to go.
[02:51:17.426 --> 02:51:17.786]  We're good to go.
[02:51:46.435 --> 02:51:48.637]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:51:49.217 --> 02:51:52.079]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:55.962 --> 02:51:58.344]  All right, let's talk to Stacey in Illinois.
[02:51:58.364 --> 02:51:59.445]  Stacey, you're on the air.
[02:51:59.505 --> 02:51:59.805]  Welcome.
[02:51:59.845 --> 02:52:00.465]  Thanks for holding.
[02:52:01.366 --> 02:52:01.906]  Hi, Alex.
[02:52:02.267 --> 02:52:02.547]  Hello.
[02:52:02.767 --> 02:52:03.347]  Hi, Robert.
[02:52:03.408 --> 02:52:06.910]  I also have your book, The Who's Who of the Elite, and that's a great book.
[02:52:06.950 --> 02:52:08.331]  I just wanted to say thanks for that.
[02:52:08.611 --> 02:52:09.692]  Well, thanks for your comment.
[02:52:09.912 --> 02:52:10.373]  You're welcome.
[02:52:10.433 --> 02:52:15.116]  I have a question, and I'd like to get your opinion on it as well as Paul Watson's thoughts, and it's
[02:52:15.529 --> 02:52:23.615]  Two questions related to the passenger manifest of the allegedly hijacked flight that hit the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in Pennsylvania.
[02:52:24.176 --> 02:52:30.300]  If you go to CNN.com, on their website, they have the passenger manifest posted for each of the flights.
[02:52:30.941 --> 02:52:37.245]  And at the top of the page it says, for instance, on Flight 93 in Pennsylvania, it says there are 45 passengers.
[02:52:37.305 --> 02:52:43.290]  But if you count the names there on the screen, there's always a discrepancy for all four of the flights.
[02:52:43.863 --> 02:52:50.064]  For instance, they only list 33 names of the 45 supposed passengers.
[02:52:50.285 --> 02:52:52.185]  Well, I'll tell you why they had to do that, ma'am.
[02:52:52.205 --> 02:53:00.647]  I mean, you want them to answer it, that's fine, but that's because at least nine of the 19 have been found to be alive.
[02:53:01.587 --> 02:53:04.888]  Then it turned out that one of the fake passports they dropped at the scene...
[02:53:05.689 --> 02:53:05.989]  Well, yeah.
[02:53:06.009 --> 02:53:09.691]  I mean, the FBI admitted in Insight Magazine about a year ago that they still don't know who the hijackers were.
[02:53:09.711 --> 02:53:13.514]  And then other officers of the FBI, if you ring them up, will say it's an ongoing investigation.
[02:53:13.534 --> 02:53:13.574]  So...
[02:53:33.109 --> 02:53:35.131]  No, there were no hijackers on any of the planes.
[02:53:35.191 --> 02:53:37.292]  If they were, then the hijackers were hijacked.
[02:53:37.813 --> 02:53:49.142]  I mean, the bottom line is, you know, 20% occupancy at the busiest time of the morning when you'd expect at least seven... 20% on all four airplanes, not averaged together 20%, magically 20.3% on all.
[02:53:49.723 --> 02:53:50.443]  Robert, comments?
[02:53:50.884 --> 02:53:59.851]  Well, and the plane that hit the Pentagon, we don't know that that wasn't a drone that was supplied by the military.
[02:54:00.416 --> 02:54:10.283]  Because the first time was a 12-foot hole with blast points around it, and no video of a plane, and then it collapses, and they go, look, that's where the plane hit.
[02:54:10.523 --> 02:54:14.566]  Yeah, and there are no engines laying off to the side, no wings.
[02:54:14.666 --> 02:54:28.195]  You know, when the body went into the building, it would have sheared the wings off, and all photographs taken of the scene, there's only one or two very small pieces of aluminum laying out there, and
[02:54:29.028 --> 02:54:30.669]  They don't even look like wings.
[02:54:31.490 --> 02:54:39.396]  And then the engines on those planes are made of very high heat-resisting materials, and they wouldn't burn up.
[02:54:39.676 --> 02:54:40.136]  That's right.
[02:54:40.217 --> 02:54:40.857]  Thanks, Stacy.
[02:54:40.877 --> 02:54:41.457]  Great points.
[02:54:41.497 --> 02:54:42.859]  Call back tomorrow if you've got more.
[02:54:43.099 --> 02:54:43.979]  Dave in Colorado.
[02:54:44.039 --> 02:54:44.940]  We'll try to get James in.
[02:54:44.960 --> 02:54:45.500]  Go ahead, Dave.
[02:54:46.361 --> 02:54:46.781]  Hey, Alex.
[02:54:46.982 --> 02:54:52.126]  I wanted to give your new listeners a couple additional examples of why they should get the road to tyranny.
[02:54:53.146 --> 02:54:54.948]  Jarred my memory on a couple things.
[02:54:55.528 --> 02:54:56.389]  I remember after...
[02:54:57.079 --> 02:55:05.805]  First WTC attack, I was reading a nice little Reader's Digest article about how the feds funded and conducted that operation in the 90s.
[02:55:06.025 --> 02:55:07.286]  First WTC attack.
[02:55:07.867 --> 02:55:08.507]  Yes.
[02:55:08.947 --> 02:55:14.751]  And then I was home the day of Oklahoma City bombing, and remember, I'd forgotten all these things until I saw The Road to Tyranny.
[02:55:15.092 --> 02:55:16.313]  Yeah, and it's all public stuff.
[02:55:16.333 --> 02:55:17.633]  We just bring it together in the film.
[02:55:18.014 --> 02:55:19.395]  I was one of the sheep, but...
[02:55:20.399 --> 02:55:33.248]  I was at home when they were running the crawlers on CNN underneath the screen, and these crawlers, keep in mind, only lasted about 30 minutes, and it said three Arab men seen leaving town in a van or a truck.
[02:55:33.608 --> 02:55:35.789]  And they were caught on video, but they worked for the U.S.
[02:55:35.809 --> 02:55:37.230]  government, so they said forget about it.
[02:55:37.591 --> 02:55:42.174]  But then, yeah, and then mysteriously, after 30 minutes, those crawlers disappeared off the screen.
[02:55:42.794 --> 02:55:44.295]  They stopped running those crawlers.
[02:55:44.375 --> 02:55:47.017]  You know, these are all great callers, and I wish we weren't out of time.
[02:55:47.077 --> 02:55:47.537]  Thanks, Dave.
[02:55:47.657 --> 02:55:49.959]  James in Texas, real quick, you got the last word.
[02:55:50.888 --> 02:56:01.472]  Yeah, I just have a comment about all these new non-lethal weapons that they're producing to try to maybe control crowds or whatnot.
[02:56:01.792 --> 02:56:02.072]  Yes.
[02:56:02.292 --> 02:56:05.193]  I was hoping you could expand on... Well, they're not really non-lethal.
[02:56:05.213 --> 02:56:06.133]  They're training aids.
[02:56:06.153 --> 02:56:10.515]  We train them how to engage the population, and they are lethal in many cases.
[02:56:11.095 --> 02:56:14.376]  Paul Watson, Robert Galen Ross, what do you think of non-lethal weapons?
[02:56:15.246 --> 02:56:23.450]  I mean, it's the mechanism for the police state where they can get away with more horror without many people seeing the consequences because, you know, that's what non-lethal is.
[02:56:23.650 --> 02:56:24.351]  It's crowd control.
[02:56:24.391 --> 02:56:24.571]  Yep.
[02:56:24.791 --> 02:56:30.114]  Robert Galen Ross, Paul Joseph Watson, James in Texas, everybody, all our stations, God bless you all.
[02:56:30.174 --> 02:56:30.534]  Take care.
[02:56:30.594 --> 02:56:31.354]  Thanks for coming on.
[02:56:31.514 --> 02:56:32.515]  We'll see you back tomorrow.
[02:56:32.535 --> 02:56:34.476]  Be sure and join us back tonight, 9 to midnight.
